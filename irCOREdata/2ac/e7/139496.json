Introduction  \nFriction surfacing is an important surface engineering technique used for obtaining various \nhard metal coatings for numerous practical applications. It involves rotating a rod of the \ncoating material onto a substrate under the action of external load the frictional heat generated \nat the rubbing interface is sufficient to deposit a layer of hot plasticized metal on a substrate. \nCommon to many other processes, friction surfacing involves a moving heat source and the \ntemperature field created at the bond interface, influences the diffusion rates at the deposit-\nsubstrate interface, which subsequently will determine the strength of the bond [1, 2]. Several \nclosed form mathematical models of moving circular or elliptical heat sources have been \nreported [3 through 9,14], however the limitations of these models with changing boundary \nconditions, temperature dependence of physical parameters and complex geometry makes \nthem less practical for present application. In the present study a numerical model and its \nvalidation against the experimental results is presented.  \nInsert Nomenclature \n1.1 Process parameters  \nThe figure 1 shows the process parameters categorized into three main categories that are \nprocess inputs, state indicators and process outputs [11, 12, 13]. Another important factor that \nwill significantly affect the process is the temperature field generated in the substrate which in \nturn will define the bond interface temperature. \nInsert figure1 \nThe rotational speed (rpm) and feed rate of mechtrode (Vz) and the traverse rate of the \nsubstrate (Vx) are the essential machine input parameters. A particular combination of these \ninput parameters will be most suitable for a particular application. Force (Fn) and substrate \ntemperatures (T1, T2, T3, T4) at specific locations are the measurable in process parameters \nwhich are indicative of the state of the process. Bond strength (S), coating thickness (T) and \nwidth (W) are the necessary process outputs that cannot be measured or quantified during the \nprocess. The bond interface temperature as a result of temperature field generated in the \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 4\nsubstrate is responsible for successful deposition. Since this temperature cannot be measured \ndirectly by contact or non contact methods, an indirect approach is to resort to thermal \nmodeling to identify it.  \n \n2. Process phases and analytical models for generated frictional heat  \nOne of the basic problems while modeling such a process with numerical methods lies with \nthe identification of generated heat at frictional interface that can be used as a boundary \ncondition for determining bulk temperature fields. The approach normally employed involves \nthe development of a mathematical relation for instantaneous frictional heat generation over \nan infinitesimal area based on the process dynamics. The total frictional heat is evaluated by \nintegrating the developed relation over whole of the frictional interface. The heat generated \nduring friction surfacing process is a certain fraction of the total mechanical energy input, \nwhich can be quantified by the amount of work per unit time (power) expended in \novercoming developed frictional force at the interface, under the prevailing process \nconditions.  \nThe process is characterized by two distinct phases and since process dynamics changes from \none phase to another, mathematical models for each phase have been developed. These \nrelations are based on the assumptions of constant pressure and exponential decay [7, 10, 13] \nof coefficient of friction with sliding velocity. \nRcno\ndwell eRc\nFM \u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03b7\u00b5\n\u2212\n= 233\n4\n    (1) \nRcno\ndwell eRc\nFP \u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03b7\u00b5\n\u2212\n= 223\n4\n    (2) \nRcno\ndepo eRc\nFM \u03c9\n\u03c9pi\n\u03b7\u00b5\n\u2212\n= 2332\n16\n    (3) \nRcno\ndepo eRc\nFP \u03c9\n\u03c9pi\n\u03b7\u00b5\n\u2212\n= 2232\n16\n    (4) \nWhere \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 5\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\u2212\u2212= 1\n2\n222\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03b7 \u03c9 RcRce Rc\n \n \nThe above developed expressions (1 through 4) were used to predict frictional heat generated \nduring the process. The detail of symbols and abbreviations used are listed in nomenclature \n(section 1). \n \n3. Experimental Measurements \nA dedicated setup was developed for measuring force and temperatures during \nexperimentation. Thermocouples were used for temperature measurements and were placed at \nspecific locations at the bottom surface of substrate, coincident with the deposit centerline \nalong the traverse direction. The setup was designed to be repetitive; therefore, the deposition \nalways started 5mm before the first thermocouple during every experimental run. The figure2 \nshows the exact locations of the thermocouples, this placement ensured that the temperature \nprofile was recorded at two points on each part of the substrate (thicker part and thinner part) \nover the entire deposit length.  \nInsert figure 2 \nThe temperature and force records produced from the acquisition system for each \nexperimental run were saved as Excel\u2019s spread sheets for analysis and for validation of \nthermal model. The temperature and force plots are shown below, which were used for FEM \nthermal study.  \nInsert figure 3 \nThree different force values related to points B, C and D for the deposition phase of the \nprocess can be identified from the above plot. Logically an average over these values should \nsuffice but the difference in force at points B and C (1660 N) is such that an average force in \nexcess of 500N will be defined over the relatively steady force between points C and D. \nConsidering the force application durations, force at B gradually reduces to force at C within \n4.75 seconds after the start of phase II, afterwards, it remains reasonably steady from point C \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 6\nto D for 20.25 seconds of the process. Therefore, an average value of force evaluated over the \nsteady portion of force-time curve will be used for the calculation of generated frictional heat.  \nInsert figure 4 \n4.0 FEM thermal modeling \nThe finite element method is based on integral minimization of error, which is quite different \nfrom the finite difference method based on Taylor series expansion. The main advantage of \nusing the finite element method is that it allows for unstructured meshes and hence, highly \nirregular geometries can be handled. Further, values of the unknown can be generated \ncontinuously across the entire solution domain rather than at isolated points. TMG Thermal \nAnalysis (Ideas Simulation Software) was used for modeling purposes. It has the capability of \nsimulating heat transfer by conduction, convection, radiation, fluid flow, and phase change.  \n \n4.1 Prerequisites \nThe dwell phase is characterized by a stationary mechtrode (not traversing) and the heat flux \nis applied over a specific region of the substrate. The period or duration of this phase varies \nwith materials used for coating and substrate, normally it is between 4 to 8 seconds. \nConsidering the short duration of this preheat stage transient mode of analysis was adopted \nwith simulation time equivalent to the preheat time. During the deposition phase the \nmechtrode movement over the substrate makes it a moving heat source problem involving \nheat and mass transfer, hence the transient mode of analysis was considered. The system \ndefined for the thermal study constituted following essential components and interactions. \n\u2022 Coating material rod  \n\u2022 Deposit  \n\u2022 Substrate  \n\u2022 Clamping device  \n\u2022 Interaction between coating material rod and machine spindle chuck  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 7\n\u2022 Interaction between substrate bottom surface and holding device mounted on the \nmachine bed.  \n\u2022 Interaction at the rubbing interface between the rotating rod and the deposit \n\u2022 Interaction between the deposit and the substrate  \n\u2022 Interaction between the system and the surrounding fluid (air)  \nThe mentioned components of the system defined the geometric entities of the model and the \ninteractions described the boundary conditions to be applied to the geometric model for \nthermal analysis. For realistic comparison between the simulation and experimental results, \nthe modeled geometry has to be close to the real geometry of the components with minimum \nsimplifications. However, certain details that are considered less significant are always \nomitted to simplify the model. The geometric simplifications that were made during the \nmodeling process are listed below:  \n\u2022 The area due to the cold laps was ignored, and the width of the deposit was taken \nequal to the effective heat generation area of the mechtrode.  \n\u2022 The flash over the cylindrical surface of the mechtrode was ignored.  \n\u2022 The thickness of the deposit was assumed to be uniform.  \nThe figure below is the diagrammatic representation of the factors that were considered \nbefore modeling the process.  \nInsert figure 5 \n \n4.2 Geometric modeling: The shape and the true dimensions of the substrate as shown in \nfigure 2 were modeled. The deposit of uniform thickness, width equal to the approximate \neffective diameter of the rubbing interface and length equal to that obtained during actual run \nwere modeled. The coating layer was discretised into crescent shaped volumes and the \nsuccessive addition of these volumes indicated the coating deposition (figure 6).  \nInsert figure 6 \nThe location of modeled deposit has the same physical orientation on the substrate as obtained \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 8\nduring experimental runs. Figure 7 shows the composite model prepared by adding the \ndeposit layer onto the top surface of the substrate. \nInsert figure 7 \nFor a deposit length of 30mm, thirty crescent shaped volumes were created each bounded by \ntwo horizontal crescent shaped and two vertical semi circular surfaces. The mechtrode was \nmodeled by a simple cylindrical shape without considering the flash around the peripheral \nregion. To simulate the dynamic changes in length during each step of the process, the \nmechtrode cylindrical volume was sectioned to create individual discs with thickness equal to \nthe change in mechtrode length based on the computed time interval (\u2206z = \u2206x(Vz\/Vx). The \nfigure 8 shows the modeled geometry; \nInsert figure 8 \nFor a mechtrode of 25mm in length, 125 circular disc shaped volumes were created with \nevery individual volume bounded by two horizontal circular surfaces and one vertical \ncylindrical surface. The clamping device (heat sink) has no physical significance apart from \nacting as a heat sink in a thermal model, therefore, the geometric representation involved only \na rectangular surface in contact with the bottom surface of substrate. The figure 9 shows the \ncomplete geometric model used for thermal analysis.  \nInsert figure 9 \n \n4.3 Material Properties \nThe process essentially involves two types of materials, a coating material and the material of \nthe substrate, although these materials can be identical but in most of the applications they are \ndifferent depending on the required surface properties. The material properties of the substrate \n(subs) and coating (coat) are listed below:  \nInsert Table 1: Material properties of Stellite 6 and SS 316 \nThe values for these properties have been obtained from literature based on average \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 9\ntemperature and on the assumption that the materials are isotropic (uniform properties in all \ndirections).  \n \n4.4 Meshing \nAll the surfaces of individual components were meshed first with linear triangular shell \nelements and then the volumes of corresponding components were meshed associatively, with \nlinear tetrahedral elements, so that the nodes of the solid elements are shared by the thin shell \nelements (surface coats) at the surface. An important aspect that needed attention in particular \nwas the location of thermocouples on the substrate surface as available from the experimental \nsetup. This location had to be represented accurately on the geometric model so that the \nelemental nodes could be placed at those specific points facilitating the extraction of \nsimulation data for comparison and validation against experimental data (based on the same \ngeometric location).  \nInsert figure 10 \nFree meshing creates nodes and elements based on the element type, element length and the \nmeshing algorithm selected, though the meshing densities at specific locations can be \ncontrolled based on the geometric model but the placement of nodes at exact locations is \nrather difficult. Therefore, anchor nodes were created which forced the free meshing \noperation to place elemental nodes at those specific points. The figure 10 shows the location \nof thermocouples where the anchor nodes were created and the generated FEM model.  \n \n4.5 Boundary Conditions \nThe boundary conditions were applied directly to geometric groups created during modeling \nof the system, referencing the associated finite element entities. The following boundary \nconditions were applied to the geometric entities  \n\u2022 Interface between the mechtrode and machine spindle chuck-Constant \nTemperature  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 10\n\u2022 Substrate holding device attached to the machine table-Constant Temperature  \n\u2022 Mechtrode frontal surface in contact with the deposit-Heat load boundary \ncondition. \n\u2022 Free convection from the substrate surfaces \n\u2022 Free convection from the deposit surfaces \n\u2022 Forced convection from the mechtrode cylindrical surface \nFollowing types of thermal couplings were used based on the interface:  \n4.5.1 Resistance Coupling.  \n\u2022 Between the bottom surface of substrate and clamping device.  \n4.5.2 Constant Coefficient Coupling.  \n\u2022 Between mechtrode contact surface and the deposit top surface.  \n\u2022 Between mechtrode (where flash is formed) and the non geometric air \nelement to simulate an enhanced heat transfer affect due to the flash \nformation.  \n4.5.3 Conductive Interface Coupling.  \n\u2022 Between bottom surface of deposit and the portion of the top surface of substrate \nassociated with it.  \n4.6 Functional Relationship \nThe simulated deposit layer ahead of the mechtrode does not exist prior to the deposition \nprocess. Therefore, to model this effect the coating layer was discretised into crescent shaped \nvolumes and \u201cbirth and death\u201d method was used to deactivate and activate elements \nthroughout the analysis. In our study this was achieved by varying thermal conductivity of the \nelements associated with each volume at predefined intervals (\u2206t = \u2206x\/Vx) validated against \nthe experimental results. The thermal conductivity of elements ahead of mechtrode is \nconsidered negligible and just at the instant before the mechtrode is about to move over the \nelement the conductivity switches to its specified value thus representing the physical \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 11\nbehavior of the friction surfacing process. \nInsert figure 11 \nThe above plot shows the linear increase in thermal conductivity of a group of finite elements \nwithin a crescent shaped volume during the calculated time step. The number of functions \ndefined was equivalent to the number of volumes into which the deposit was divided. \n \n4.7 Run Time Parameters \nTo simulate the traverse of the substrate during the deposition process a special feature of \narticulation provided within TMG was used. It allows modeling of rigid body motion of \nselected elements with respect to the rest of the model. The basic control parameters of the \ntime span for the solution and the result output interval were calculated from the process \nparameters and the time step was optimized based on the deviation of simulation results from \nthe experimental results to minimize the numerical error. Figure 12 provides the diagrammatic \nrepresentation of the adopted modeling procedure.  \nInsert figure 12 \n \n5. Application of the developed FEM models \nCoupled FEM thermal analysis was carried out, to obtain the numerical solution of \ntemperature field. Following parameters were used in the calculation of the temperature fields \nduring the deposition of Stellite 6 on SS316.  \nInsert Table 2: Machine input parameters for the deposition of Stellite 6 on SS 316 \n \nInsert Table 3: Selected values for the parameters quantifying frictional heat. \n \nThe adopted methodology is diagrammatically shown below:  \nInsert figure 13 \nThe frictional heat generated during the dwell phase as calculated from relation 2, was applied \nas heat load boundary condition to the frontal surface of mechtrode along with the initial \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 12\nconditions to the FEM model for the calculated duration. The generated temperature field \nduring the dwell phase was then applied as initial condition to the FEM model along with the \nheat load calculated from relation 4 for the duration of the deposition phase.  \n5.1 Comparison between simulation and experimental results  \nThe plots indicate the simulation and experimental temperature response at each of the four \nlocations on substrate.  \nInsert figure14 \nInsert figure 15 \nThe maximum temperature values obtained at thermocouples during experimentation were \nplotted against the results from simulation to ascertain the deviation. The comparison of \nabsolute maximums showed a max error of 18% at location three (figure 15), which is within \nthe acceptable limits.  \n \n6. Conclusions  \n1. The approach of coupled transient thermal analysis to account for the temperature \nfields generated during the dwell and deposition phases of the process resulted in \nreasonably accurate results, with an error of 18% between absolute maximums. \n2. The major discrepancy between the experimental and simulated results occurred at \nlocations with a change in substrate geometry. This indicates that more accurate \nrepresentation of the process is required. The heat distribution profile at the frictional \ninterface and variation in material properties with temperature could have significant \neffects on the thermal response. \n3. The validated numerical model could be used to predict bond interface temperature \nand relations between the machine input parameters, the bond interface temperature \nand the process response (coating thickness, width and strength) could be established. \nThis would allow for accurate selection of machining parameters for optimum process \nresponse.  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 14\nAcknowledgements  \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of EU grant CRAFT \u2013 1999 -70658 \n\u201cFriction surfacing for multisectorial applications\u201d and the participating companies including \nFrictec Ltd., Circle Technical Services Ltd, Nordseetaucher GmbH and Neos Robotics.  \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 15\nReferences  \n[1] Bedford, G.
