In this article the major \nmechanism for the transport of glucose into and out of the blood and how that mechanism is used \nto monitor the circulating concentrations of glucose are discussed. A number of hormones regulate \nglucose in response to changes in plasma concentrations. Insulin promotes the removal of glucose \nand its conversion to glycogen. Glucagon, in response to falling glucose concentrations, increases the \nbreakdown of glycogen and the release of glucose from the liver. There are many other hormones \nthat play a part in assisting the functions of insulin and glucagon. Failures in the appropriate \nproduction of such hormones may lead to the unregulated changes in plasma glucose and \nsubsequent health problems. \n \n \nKeywords \nGlucose Plasma Homeostasis \nHormonal Regulation \n  \nThe concentration, and hence the supply, of glucose in the blood must be maintained within \nacceptable levels. For example, the brain, which has a very large demand for glucose (120 g\/day) \nwould suffer adverse effects (functional impairments, coma and even death) if there was a decrease \nin plasma glucose to below 4.0 mmol\/litre. Hyperglycaemia, sustained elevation of fasting plasma \nglucose above 7 mmol\/litre, may result in organ damage or ketosis in chronic or acute cases, \nrespectively. Plasma glucose comes from the dietary intake of sugars and endogenous production in \nthe liver and kidney. There can also be a rise in plasma glucose when some tissues reduce their \nuptake; some tissues achieve this by producing glucose for their own consumption, although this is a \nminor mechanism predominantly effective in starvation. Glucose is the primary source of energy for \nmost tissues; therefore there is a constant drain of glucose from the blood. A balance between \nsupply and demand must be maintained to prevent the complications mentioned above, but more \nimportantly to keep the body functioning as a whole.   \n Plasma glucose is monitored by a range of mechanisms in the body and regulated by several \nhormones. The body must be able to respond to significant increases in plasma glucose, such as after \na carbohydrate-rich meal, or decreases, such as during fasting. The body must also be able to react \nquickly to demands on the energy supply chain during exercise or survival responses (e.g. the fight or \nflight response).   \n The fate of glucose within particular cells is also dependent on the action of hormones \nregulating the metabolic pathways. As discussed below, the interplay between the metabolism of \nglucose and the circulating glucose is regulated largely by the same hormones. For example, insulin, \nsecreted in response to a rise in blood glucose, effects an increased transport of glucose into cells. At \nthe same time, insulin promotes the conversion of glucose to glycogen (the major storage form of \nglucose) and reduces the activity of other pathways that may lead to the production of glucose \n(gluconeogenesis) from other metabolites. The result is a net decrease in plasma glucose. \nConversely, glucagon, produced in response to a decrease in plasma glucose, promotes the \nbreakdown of glycogen, which in the liver can be exported to the blood as free glucose. At the same \ntime the metabolic pathways that use glucose are inhibited to reduce the demand for glucose. \nTransport of glucose  \nGlucose molecules cannot cross the plasma membrane because of the hydrophobic nature of the \nmembrane. Transport across the membrane is facilitated by a number of transporter molecules \nexpressed on the surface of cells. These molecules have been given the acronym GLUT (glucose \ntransporters). There are multiple isoforms, some of which are expressed on different cell types. How \nthey operate and their responsiveness to the regulatory hormones is key to understanding how \nglucose is removed from the blood. GLUT-1 is a constitutive (i.e. unresponsive to hormone action) \ntransporter of glucose and is responsible for the supply of a basal level of glucose. It is found in a \nnumber of cell types including the brain and the endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier; \nimportant as the brain is largely dependent on glucose as a primary energy source.  GLUT-1 also has \nan important function in the transport of glucose across epithelial layers, for example, from the \nblood stream across the capillary to the target tissue. GLUT-2, found in liver and kidney cells (but not \nsolely), is important because it not only absorbs glucose but can also transport glucose into the \nblood when plasma concentrations are low. A second important class of transporters is the sodium-\ndependent glucose co-transporters (sGLTs). sGLT1, found within the cells of the intestine, is the \nmajor facilitator for the uptake of glucose from dietary sources. Unlike the GLUT transporters that \nmediate facilitated diffusion of glucose down its concentration gradient into cells, sGLT1 is a key \ncomponent of the secondary active transport of glucose from the lumen of the gut against its \nconcentration gradient into the intestinal cells. This movement of glucose against its concentration \ngradient by sGLT1 is achieved by the co-transport of sodium down its electrochemical gradient, \nwhich in turn is maintained by the use of metabolic energy by Na-K ATPase.  Within the kidney \nsGLT2, found within the proximal tubule of the nephron of the kidney is important in glucose \nreabsorption.  \n Some GLUT molecules are responsive to hormonal action. GLUT-4, found in adipose and \nskeletal tissues, is expressed at low levels on cell surfaces when glucose is not readily available. In \nthe presence of high concentrations of insulin, as a result of a rise in blood glucose, cell signaling \nevents induce an increase in cell surface expression of GLUT-4, with the effect of increasing the \nuptake of glucose from the blood. \n \nPhysiological monitoring of blood glucose  \nGLUT-2 serves an important function in monitoring plasma glucose, particularly in protecting the \nbody from hypoglycaemia. GLUT-2 is found in \u03b1- (glucagon-secreting) and \u03b2- (insulin-secreting) cells \nof the pancreas and in glial cells in the CNS. It is a high-affinity receptor for glucose and, as such, is \nvery sensitive to glucose concentrations. Loss of GLUT-2 in animal models can be lethal because \nthere is a resulting inability to manage low plasma glucose. Auto-antibodies to GLUT-2 have been \nfound in patients with type 1 diabetes, suggesting a role for the loss of this sensor in the \ndevelopment of the disease.1  It is not entirely clear how GLUT-2 responds to low concentrations, but \nthere is probably more than one mechanism. The most likely mechanism is the glucose-sensing \nability of \u03b2 cells. When plasma (and interstitial) glucose is high GLUT-2 transports the glucose into \u03b2 \ncells. The rise in glucose and\/or metabolites derived from glycolysis within \u03b2 cells triggers the \nproduction of insulin.2 Conversely, the influx of glucose into the \u03b1 cells triggers a signalling event that \nresults in the inhibition of glucagon production. However, glucagon secretion still Increases to \nprevent the decrease In hepatic glucose output and hypoglycaemia that may occur if the increase in \nthe insulin:glucagon ratio was to continue unchecked. The molar ratio of insulin:glucagon is usually \naround 2.0. Increases In this ratio (e.g., after a meal) enhances glucose uptake, utilisation and \nconversion to glycogen; whereas decreases in the ratio (due to either increased insulin or decreased \nglucagon; seen during fasting and prolonged exercise) leads to increased glycogenolysis, \ngluconeogenesis, and amino acid mobilisation; thereby maintaining a supply of glucose to the CNS.  \nA fine balance between insulin and glucagon levels is achieved, notably by a form of self regulation.  \nProduction of glucagon is regulated by plasma levels of insulin and it has been observed that intra-\nislet insulin action is essential for suppression of glucagon in response to hyperglycemia, that is, \nglucagon is not repressed solely by high glucose levels.  In addition, GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) \nproduced in \u03b2 cells also affects glucagon secretion.  While there is no apparent rise in GABA levels as \na result of hyperglycaemia, insulin appears to upregulate the GABA receptor on \u03b1 cells, inhibiting \nformation of glucagon. \n The brain also has a part to play in the sensing of blood glucose via GLUT-2 expressed on glial \ncells. The pancreatic \u03b1 cells are also under the control of the sympathoadrenal response and \nepinephrine is secreted after a fall in glucose, prompting a subsequent increase in glucagon levels.  \nThe classical \"fight or flight\" response reflects the role of neurotransmitters such as GABA or \nacetylcholine evoking epinephrine production.  The \u03b1 cells also respond to a reduction in insulin \nlevels, whereby low concentrations trigger the production of glucagon. Thus, there is a reciprocal \nmonitoring of blood glucose by GLUT-2, where the actual response is dependent on the cell type. It \nis worth noting that there may be a redundancy in monitoring via GLUT-2, as GLUT-1 in animal \nmodels can functionally replace GLUT-2. \nHormonal prevention of hyperglycaemia  \nHyperglycaemia is a major problem, and various hormones are mobilized to reduce excess blood \nglucose (Table 1). Whilst insulin is a major factor in controlling plasma glucose concentrations, other \nhormones also have important roles. Insulin is produced from a prohormone (proinsulin) that is \ncleaved into two components: insulin and C-peptide. The ability of insulin to decrease plasma \nglucose is well understood, but the functionality of C-peptide is only beginning to become clear. C-\npeptide can be shown to increase the effectiveness of insulin-dependent uptake, suggesting that it \nhas a role in carbohydrate metabolism.   \n After a carbohydrate-containing meal, various gut hormones, termed incretins, are released \ninto the blood as a first-line of defense against hyperglycaemia. The incretins have a stimulatory \neffect on the production of insulin, and it seems that glucose in the lumen of the gut stimulates \nrelease of two incretins, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 \n(GLP-1), which possibly act as a forewarning to the pancreatic \u03b2 cells to begin producing insulin, and \nact by reducing glucagon production from \u03b1 cells.3  Experimentally, these actions explain why oral \nglucose can be more effective in stimulating insulin release because intravenous glucose bypasses \nthis mechanism. However, it is important that control of incretin secretion is maintained to prevent \nhypoglycaemia. Recently, two drugs (exenatide and sitagliptin), based on the action of incretins, \nhave been made available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes because a number of individuals with \nthis disorder have shown a decreased functionality of the incretins.   \n Circulating insulin promotes uptake of plasma glucose primarily by inducing the increased \nsurface expression of the GLUT-4 receptor on a number of tissues. Skeletal muscle tissue is the most \nimportant repository for glucose in the fed state, and its sensitivity to insulin is important for \nmaintaining glycaemic homeostasis. During exercise the muscle can become more sensitized to the \neffect of insulin, inducing increased glucose uptake and post-exercise conversion to glycogen;4 \nhowever, the enhancement is not insulin dependent and occurs due to a currently undefined \nmechanism. \n Other hormones have the potential to reduce the occurrence of hyperglycaemia. Insulin-like \ngrowth factor 1 (IGF-1) is produced by a number of tissues in response to growth hormone and is \nstructurally similar to insulin. It can replace insulin, although with reduced activity, and clinical trials \ninvestigating its effect in type 1 and 2 diabetes are ongoing. IGF-1 may bind to the insulin receptor, \nthus activating the insulin-responsive signaling pathway. Leptin, a hormone released by adipose \ntissue acts to suppress appetite and hence sugar intake. The receptor for this hormone is found in \nthe hypothalamus, notably in the ventral medial nucleus (the so-called satiety centre). Leptin can \nexert direct effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues. In peripheral tissues leptin \ninhibits lipogenesis, glycogen synthesis, stimulates utilization of fatty acids, leading to decreased \ntriglyceride content, and causes an improvement in insulin sensitivity. Leptin may function as a \nwhole-body energy store indicator because fasting can decrease leptin concentrations.   \n The effect of insulin within the cell is important in the regulation of plasma glucose. In a cell, \nglucose is \u2018trapped\u2019 by rapid conversion to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P); the fate of glucose is either \nto enter the glycolytic pathway as a perquisite to energy production via oxidative phosphorylation \nwithin the mitochondria or anaerobically by conversion to lactate. Alternatively G6P can be \nconverted to glycogen for storage for later usage as an energy source. In the liver and kidney, the \ntwo major gluconeogenic organs, G6P can be converted back to glucose and exported in the blood; \nother tissues lack the appropriate enzyme, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). If the energy status of \nthe cell is high, as evidenced by high levels of ATP or of various metabolites of the energy pathways, \nvarious feedback mechanisms come into play to halt glycolysis and there is a need to route the \nexcess glucose into glycogen. The binding of insulin to its receptor induces a signaling cascade, which \nhalts the conversion of glycogen to glucose, while simultaneously promoting the production of \nglycogen by enhancing the activity of glycogen synthase and inhibiting the glycogen catabolic \nenzyme glycogen phosphorylase; high levels of G6P within the cell also enhance the activity of the \nsynthase. At the same time the signaling cascade prevents gluconeogenesis from non-carbohydrate \nsources.  Within the liver, insulin suppresses the activity of G6Pase, preventing the export of glucose.  \nThus the net effect of insulin is to dramatically decrease plasma glucose by an increased uptake of \nthe circulating sugar, conversion to glycogen and preventing the formation of more endogenous \nglucose.  It is worth noting that the major role of glycogen is different depending on the organ.  In \nthe liver glycogen is primarily a source for the homeostasis of plasma glucose levels and is largely \nhormonally controlled notably insulin and glucagon.  Skeletal glycogen stores are sources for energy \nproduction within the cell where the glycogen is stored; the balance between synthesis and \ndegradation affected by the cell\u2019s energy state (high ATP = synthesis, high AMP = degradation); \ntherefore skeletal glycogen has a role in the decrease of serum glucose (as a store) but not as a \nsource for replenishing low plasma levels. \nHormonal prevention of hypoglycaemia \nThe pathological consequences of low plasma glucose have been discussed above. Hypoglycaemia \ncan also occur as a consequence of an individual with diabetes injecting too much insulin, but \nfortunately there are mechanisms to minimize this problem. The most basic response is to increase \nplasma glucose by either ingesting carbohydrates or by increasing de novo synthesis of glucose from \nnon-carbohydrate sources such as glycerol (obtained from the breakdown of triglycerides) or \nglutamine in the kidney. Such a response is also coupled to a decreased uptake of glucose from the \nblood into skeletal tissue. In a patient without diabetes falls in plasma glucose are usually due to \nfasting or prolonged exercise that requires high levels of energy to be supplied to the muscles, and \nhence a greater requirement for the delivery of glucose as the stocks of glycogen held within the cell \nare depleted. The liver now becomes the focus of much activity, as it is the primary contributor of \nnon-dietary glucose to the blood because of the presence of G6Pase. However, during glycolysis, the \nend product (pyruvate) may be converted to lactate because of anaerobic respiration instead of \nentering the oxidative pathway for energy metabolism. The lactate produced will be transported to \nthe liver where it can be converted back to pyruvate (the Cori cycle) and ultimately used to \nregenerate glucose by the gluconeogenic pathway. Gluconeogenesis becomes more important \nduring times of fasting and starvation when glycogen is depleted. The kidney, as the other major \ngluconeogenic organ, producing glucose mainly from the conversion of glutamine, plays a significant \nrole in the maintenance of adequate blood glucose.5 Indeed, as much as 20% of blood glucose may \nbe renal in origin and after significant fasting (> 4 weeks) the kidney may contribute as much as 50%. \nWhere glucagon output is lost in patients with diabetes the recovery (without assistance from \nexogenously supplied glucagon) from hypoglycaemia is heavily dependent on the kidney. In healthy \nindividuals glucose production by the kidney is enhanced by epinephrine and inhibited by insulin. \n A number of hormones are released in response to decreasing glucose concentrations (Table \n1).  Catecholamine hormones increase the rate at which glycogen is converted to glucose (by \naffecting the activity of G6Pase) and the rate glucose is delivered into the blood stream at times of \nstress, such as during exercise. Other stress-related hormones (e.g. somatostatin and cortisol) also \nreact to a fall in blood glucose. Somatostatin has a multitude of effects that may contribute to \nnormal plasma glucose concentrations: inhibiting release of thyroid stimulating hormone, thus \nreducing metabolism and the demand for glucose; inhibiting the release of insulin; and possibly \nlowering the rate of gastric emptying. \n The effects of glucagon in the fasting state and the catecholamines during the fight or flight \nresponse elevate blood glucose by promoting hepatic gluconeogenesis. Glucagon secretion during \ndeclining plasma glucose and stimulation of the pancreatic \u03b1-cells by epinephrine and \nnorepinephrine effectively reverse the effects of insulin: promoting the breakdown of glycogen, \nenhancing the activity of G6Pase, as well as other enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway, whilst \ninhibiting the glycolytic pathways. In patients with type 1 diabetes, a reduced ability to respond to \nhypoglycaemia is often observed. Frequently these patients have an impaired autonomic response \nthat affects the production of glucagon. Their pancreatic \u03b1 cells may also become less able to \nproduce glucagon due to continuous low concentrations of insulin. \n Comment \n There are a significant number of regulatory mechanisms controlling the homeostasis of \nplasma glucose levels that attempt to keep the level within acceptable physiological norms.  Failure \nto do so, as in diabetes has dire consequences leading to further serious health risks such as \ncardiovascular disease.  An understanding of the basic mechanisms, particularly the role of insulin, \nwill help inform further health related topics. The UK is facing an epidemic of type 2 diabetes due to \nrising levels of obesity that, while insulin is present, there is a net decrease in the system resulting in \nthe inability to regulate glucose levels ultimately leading to major health risks . \n \n  \n References \n1 Inman L, McAllister C, Chen L, et al.
