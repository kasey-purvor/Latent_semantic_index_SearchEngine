A noise-induced enhancement of\nthe heterodyne signal and of the signal-to-noise ratio has been predicted and observed in an\nall-optical bistable system for the beams at different wavelengths. \u00a9 1995 American Institute of\nPhysics.Recent progress in optical signal processing and optical\ncommunication1,2 has highlighted the problem of controlling\nthe signal and the signal-to-noise ratio ~SNR! in optical sys-\ntems. An interesting effect that may provide a new and ef-\nfective tool for such control is stochastic resonance ~SR! in\nwhich both the signal and the SNR at the output of a nonlin-\near system can be increased by adding noise.3 Most investi-\ngations of SR to date4 have related to low-frequency signals\ndriving bistable systems, including active5 and passive6,7 op-\ntically bistable ~OB! systems. In such cases, the SR mecha-\nnism can operate effectively provided ~i! the stationary popu-\nlations of the states are nearly equal to each other,8 and ~ii!\nthe frequency of the force is much smaller than the reciprocal\nrelaxation time tr\n21 of the system. It was recently sug-\ngested,9 however, and demonstrated in analogue simulations,\nthat a related phenomenon can occur when a nonlinear sys-\ntem is driven by two high frequency signals: if the resultant\nheterodyne signal is of sufficiently low frequency, both it and\nits SNR can be enhanced by the addition of noise.\nIn this letter we report observation and outline a theory\nof a new form of all-optical heterodyning, noise-enhanced\noptical heterodyning ~NEOH!. The system studied is a\nbistable interferometer with a dispersive mechanism of non-\nlinearity. The intensity of the light at the output of the inter-\nferometer IT is related to that of the incident light I in via a\ntransmission coefficient N(f) that depends periodically on\nthe phase gain f of the light inside the interferometer,\nIT5I in N~f!, N~f12p!5N~f!. ~1!\nThe phase gain itself depends nonlinearly on I in . A practi-\ncally important example of a two-dimensional array of\nbistable microresonators, of 4 mm diameter and threshold\npower below 100 mW, has been demonstrated recently.10\na!Electronic mail: dykman@pa.msu.edu\nb!Electronic mail: golubev@dpt207.vniims.msk.edu\nc!Electronic mail: kaufman@dpt207.vniims.msk.edu\nd!Electronic mail: luchinsk@dpt207.vniims.msk.edu\nand d.luchinsky@lancaster.ac.uk\ne!Electronic mail: p.v.e.mcclintock@lancaster.ac.uk308 Appl.

We consider one here for which, in\naddition to the resonant signal beam, the cavity is driven by\na nonresonant reference beam of intensity I ref(t), which af-\nfects the phase gain f for the resonant beam. The dynamics\nof the phase gain in such a system can often11 be described,\nto a reasonable approximation, by a Debye relaxation equa-\ntion\nf\u02d9 1\n1\ntr\n~f2f0!5I in~ t !

The explicit\nforms of the periodic absorption coefficient M (f), and of\nN(f), depend on the construction of the interferometer and\nare well-known for simple models, such as a Fabry-Perot\ncavity filled with a medium with cubic nonlinearity ~cf. Ref.\n11!.\nWe assume that the intensity of the resonant radiation\nhas a high-frequency component ~of frequency v0@tr\n21)\nwith amplitude A in(t) and\/or phase c(t) modulated by a\nlow-frequency signal, whereas the intensity of the reference\nbeam includes the high-frequency component and the noise\nDI(t),\nI in~ t !5I\u00afin1A in~ t !cos@v0t1c~ t !# ,\nI ref~ t !5I\u00afref1A ref cosv0t1DI~ t !, ~3!\n^DI~ t !DI~ t8!&'2Dd~ t2t8!.\nHere, I\u00afref and I\u00afin are constant components in the intensities of\nthe two laser beams.\nEquations ~2! and ~3! describe Brownian motion of the\nphase gain.

In the range of optical bistability the\npotential U(f) is of double-well form, with minima at\nf1 , f2 corresponding to the stable states of the system ~4!\nin the absence of the modulation. The slowly varying force\n}A(t) in ~4! gives rise to a modulation of the intensity of the\ntransmitted radiation IT which, as we show below, can be\nenhanced via noise.\nFor small modulation amplitudes, A in \/v0 , A ref \/v0!1,\nthe heterodyning is fully characterized by the assumption of\nsinusoidal modulation, A in5const, c(t)5Vt , and standard\nlinear response theory may be applied to the analysis of Eqs.\n~1!\u2013~4!. To first order in A5A inA ref\/2v0 the intensity of the\ntransmitted radiation is given by\n^IT~ t !&5^I\u00afT&1Im @x~V!A exp~2iVt !# ,\nwhere x(V) is the susceptibility. To find x(V) we notice\nthat, for low noise intensity D , the system spends most of its\ntime fluctuating about the stable states n51,2. The suscep-\ntibility is then given by the sum of two kinds of contribution:\nfirst, from the vibrations about these states xn , weighted by\nthe stationary populations of the states wn ; and secondly the\nterm x tr(V) resulting from the periodic modulation of the\npopulations by the force A exp(2iVt),\nx~V!5 (\nn51,2\nwnxn~V!1x tr~V!.\nFor V!tr\n21 the intrawell susceptibilities correspond to the\nquasistatic forcing,\nxn~V!5N8~fn!1M 8~fn!~]I\u00afTn \/]I ref!,\nI\u00afTn5I\u00af inN~fn!, ~5!\n^I\u00afT&5 (\nn51,2\nwnI\u00afTn ,\nwhere fn is the value of the phase f in the nth stable state in\nthe absence of modulation; it is given by the corresponding\nsolution of Eqs. ~2! and ~3! with A in5A ref5DI50.\nThe term in the susceptibility due to the modulation of\nthe populations can be evaluated along the lines13:\nx tr~V!5\nw1w2\nD @I\n\u00af\nT12I\u00afT2#@M ~f1!2M ~f2!#\n3\nW121W21\nW121W212iV\n. ~6!\nHere, Wnm is the probability of the transition n!m between\nthe stable states for A in5A ref50. The quantities W12 , W21\nfor Brownian motion ~4! were evaluated by Kramers.14 TheirAppl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 67, No. 3, 17 July 1995dependence on the noise intensity D is of the activation type,\nand therefore the susceptibility ux(V)u of a bistable optical\nsystem with respect to heterodyning may increase with the\nincreasing noise intensity.\nThe SNR is often taken to be inversely proportional to\nthe product of the spectral density of the noise and a charac-\nteristic frequency resolution dv , and the strategy for maxi-\nmising the SNR is to minimise both of these quantities. In\nNEOH, on the other hand, we are not greatly concerned with\ndv ~which can be minimised independently by application of\nthe usual methods!. Rather, we characterise the SNR for the\nheterodyning by the ratio R of the low-frequency signal in\nthe intensity of the transmitted radiation, given by\n1\n4 A2ux(V)u2, to the value of the power spectrum Q (0)(v) at\nthe same frequency for A50 which can be evaluated in a\nsimilar way to x(V). It follows immediately that for\nV!tr\n21\n, in sharp contradistinction to the standard case, R\ncan display an exponentially sharp increase with increasing\nnoise intensity in the range of I\u00afin ,I\u00afref for which w1'w2 .\nFIG. 1.

The narrow spike corresponds to the heterodyne\nsignal. The inset shows examples of the reference signal ~for v0 5 800 Hz,\nlower trace! and input signal (v06V with V 5 3.92 Hz, upper trace!, as\nfunctions of time.309Dykman et al.\nThe experimental arrangement used to test this predic-\ntion ~Fig. 1! incorporates a double-cavity membrane system\n~DCMS!.15 Its construction is similar to that of standard\nspatial-membrane light modulators,16 except that it is oper-\nated by light instead of voltage. The first resonator consists\nof a ;1 mm membrane of semiconducting GaSe single crys-\ntal, separated from a plane dielectric mirror by a metal dia-\nphragm ;500 mm in diameter. The ;10 mm air-filled gap\nbetween the mirror and the membrane forms a second reso-\nnator. The incident beam from an argon laser, of wavelength\n514.5 nm, propagates along the normal to the mirror provid-\ning an input signal. An additional beam of wavelength 488\nnm from the argon laser, inclined with respect to the DCMS\naxis, provides a reference signal. The intensities of the laser\nbeams are modulated in time by two electro-optic modula-\ntors ~EOM1, EOM2!, to which periodic signals and noise are\napplied as shown. Optical bistability arises because of ther-\nmoelastic bending of the membrane caused by the main\n~514.5 nm! laser beam. The phase gain of the air-resonator is\nlinear in bending and thus follows adiabatically the thermal\nrelaxation of the film. Heating of the DCMS by the 488 nm\nreference signal is directly proportional to its intensity. Sys-\ntems of this kind, which display optical bi- and multistability\nfor low light intensities, are ideally suited to investigations of\nphenomena related to optical bistability,17 including stochas-\ntic resonance.6\nTo seek noise-enhanced optical heterodyning, the refer-\nence signal ~488 nm! was modulated periodically at a fre-\nquency v0 in the range 0.5\u20132.5 kHz ~lower trace, Fig. 2\ninset! and in addition by noise with a cutoff frequency of 5\nkHz. The input signal ~514.5 nm! was modulated at frequen-\ncies v06V , with V53.92 Hz ~upper trace!. A heterodyne\nsignal at frequency V 5 3.92 Hz was detected in the trans-\nmitted light intensity IT at wavelength 514.5 nm. The mea-\nsured relaxation time tr of the DCMS was ;2 ms; for most\nof the measurements v052.1 kHz; and so the condition\nV!tr\n21!v0 was well met. With noise-induced fluctuational\ntransitions occurring between two stable states of the DCMS,\na strong heterodyne signal ~the spike in Fig. 2! appeared,\nsuperimposed on the zero-frequency Lorenzian peak in the\nspectral density of fluctuations of IT with a halfwidth equal\nFIG. 3.

The enhancement of the SNR occurs within a\nrestricted range of noise intensities, as expected, and the ratio\nbetween the value of R at the minimum to that at the local\nmaximum ~i.e., the maximum noise-induced \u2018\u2018amplification\u2019\u2019\nof the signal-to-noise ratio! is ;10. A fuller discussion and a\ndetailed quantitative comparison with the theory will be\ngiven elsewhere.\nIn conclusion, we have predicted, and observed experi-\nmentally, the phenomenon of noise-enhanced optical hetero-\ndyning. The advantageous features of NEOH compared to\nconventional heterodyning techniques are that it is intrinsi-\ncally noise-protected and highly frequency selective, and that\nit can be performed within a single all-optical device.\nOne of us ~D.G.L.! would like to acknowledge the warm\nhospitality of Lancaster University.
