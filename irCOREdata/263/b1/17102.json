Reflections on ethnicity, culture and the idea of \u2018girlhood\u2019  \nShakuntala Banaji \nNothing crystallizes the mind like the threat of impending violence. The weeks after \nSeptember 11th 2001 and leading up to the inexorable bombing of Afghanistan by the \nUSA, Great Britain and various other Western allies were no exception to this \nunsurprising but unwritten adage.   \nLeading journalists and academics in the United Kingdom, North America and across the \nglobe were called upon by the media to discuss the idea that a bombing, which was \nactually being administered not as support but as chastisement to the Afghani people, was \nsupposedly a long-awaited liberation of the destitute, oppressed and suffering women of \nAfghanistan. In the UK, writers who had been sympathetic to the left-wing movements of \nthe late sixties and early seventies, whose feminist politics was a badge of honour, found \nthemselves being asked difficult questions about whether they were in support of a war \nwhich would liberate the girls of Afghanistan from their oppression, or against it. No \nmore Veils. No more hiding. A return of schools and education. The return of the right to \nwork. The bombs will bring a democratic paradise, and the ones who will gain most will \nbe the girls, I heard, on the news and talk shows and in-depth interviews, read in the \npapers and on the Internet and in journals and a sudden spate of academic tracts. Of \ncourse, there were dissenting voices. But these were the usual suspects. And some of \nthem were men. People who thought that \u2018bombing women out of their burkhas\u2019 might \nnot be such a very democratic, feminist idea.   \nA year after the supposedly rousing defeat of the Taliban by American missiles, I read an \narticle1 by the journalist Polly Toynbee, described by the British newspaper the Guardian \nas \u2018one of the most robust liberal supporters of the war\u2019. In this article she asked \nquestions about whether the bombs had done a good job after all. Whether the women \nwere happier now, the people more free: \u2018So was it worth it after all? The daisy-cutters \nand the cluster bombs, the misguided missiles butchering wedding parties while al-Qaida \nslipped away?\u2019 Everyone she spoke to seemed to say that \u2018the Americans\u2019 had done a \ngood job. But not content with this, Toynbee correctly dug deeper. If we\u2019ve done a good \njob, she asked, why are most of the women and girls still wearing burkhas? Granted they \nare traumatized by the long horrors of their recent history \u2013 they tell her about years of \nnever seeing the sun, months of beatings and abuse by drunken husbands; granted they \nare afraid \u2013 men control the economy still \u2013 and poor \u2013 the war has not created jobs \u2013 and \nthere is little money forthcoming from the attacking nations for any changes in civil lives: \nBut why don\u2019t they get together and challenge the system, now that they have been freed? \nAnd her answer is one that cannot be paraphrased, but must be quoted:  \nOnce the shutter of religion falls, the rest is silence. The women are indoctrinated \nso deep with it that their own inferiority is branded on their brains. Every time \nsophisticated Muslims in the west use sophistry to explain that the prophet was \n                                                 \n1 This article appeared in the Guardian on Wednesday November 13 2002 on p2 of the Comment & \nfeatures section. \nactually a great liberator of women, every time they fail to condemn outright \nsome of the Koranic laws themselves and demand reformation, they help \ncondemn women across the Islamic world to this self-immolating damage. \n(Toynbee, The Guardian, Wednesday November 13 2002 \nhttp:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/world\/2002\/nov\/13\/afghanistan.comment )  \nSo what\u2019s the point of this long preamble?   \nI have little interest in discrediting a single feminist journalist from the UK. Of course, \nthe words here are stark, and some would say offensive: \u2018indoctrination\u2019, \u2018sophisticated \nMuslims\u2019, \u2018inferiority\u2019, \u2018self-immolation\u2019, \u2018branded on their brains\u2019. The feminist group, \nThe Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) and other groups, \nwho worked secretly for so many years from within Afghanistan, might be forgiven for \nseeing red. However, I can\u2019t deny that there are times during my interviews about gender \nand sexuality, culture, news and film, with some young women and girls from across \nSouth Asia and its diasporas \u2013 Buddhist girls, Hindu girls, Jain girls, Muslim girls from \nall regions \u2013 when, in the depths of my mind, I have felt a similar frustration, a similar \nangst as they\u2019ve told me piously about the reasons why they would \u2018accept an arranged \nmarriage\u2019 or that if they \u2018caught their own daughter walking with a boy they would \ndisown her, kill her\u2019. But for every one girl who told me things like that, there were ten \nothers who said different, more complicated things. Revelations about wanting to change \naspects of their collective or individual lives and wanting to learn to accept others, \nconfidences about identifying with their parents \u2013 even sometimes authoritarian ones \u2013 \nbut also fretting against them and wanting to escape, hints and suggestions about their \nmessy, contradictory feelings towards their religion, class, sexuality, family or media and \n\u2018the west\u2019. And such messy, contradictory talk and practice does not make for easy \nassumptions of indoctrination and religious domination versus liberation and autonomy. \nBut then, perhaps Afghanistan is a special case, and Afghani women and girls have been \nstripped of the right to a subtle interpretation of their words and experiences.   \nOf late, I have reviewed numerous (feminist) articles and heard innumerable papers read \n(in the west and in India) that speak about the commercialization of teenage girls\u2019 culture \n(in the west and in India, but using the words \u2018global\u2019 and \u2018globalised\u2019) in much the same \nterms as I might speak about the Israeli bombing of a wedding party in Palestine. This \ndisapproval leveled primarily at advertisers and manufacturers but also, more subtly but \nstill distinctly at girls who want to \u2018grow up fast\u2019, or \u2018wear lipstick and high heels\u2019, or \nbuy the \u2018latest ipod\u2019 or \u2018ape western girls\u2019, in itself is not a new phenomenon; neither is \nthe fact that different feminists get exercised about different issues to do with women\u2019s \nexperiences and identities \u2013 I still count myself a feminist; they still count themselves as \nfeminists. It would be puerile to make hierarchies of suffering in order to prioritize one \ncause over another, perhaps. So, what\u2019s the problem?  \nThe problem, that I am trying to put my finger on, is not just one of scale \u2013 although the \nscale of something does indeed change it as an experience in the sense that wearing a veil \nto a wedding in Delhi and then not wearing it for weeks or months might give you a \ndifferent perspective on the veil to wearing it morning, noon and night wherever you are \nin Kabul. The problem is really one of perspective and, more specifically, the two, \nopposing and equally false notions, that either one has to take up an absolutist stance of \nwhat is and what is not a politically correct and socially healthy life for a girl and argue \nfor this as a standard against which all girlhood is then judged or that one takes up a \ncompletely relativist stance and believes in the existence of different paradigms, within \nsome of which it is \u2018okay\u2019 for girls to wear high heels and bikinis or veils and facial \nscarring at eight years old because that\u2019s part of \u2018their culture\u2019. I have heard academic \nand activist colleagues, from both the left and the right, use both these sets of arguments \nwith surprising regularity precisely because they fit neatly into a \u2018liberal\u2019 paradigm about \nhuman society and politics.  \nAnd this brings me to the tricky and complicated terrain on which researchers and \nacademics tread when they write articles and books about (any social or political aspect) \nof \u2018girls\u2019 lives, whether this be consumption, adolescent sex or clothing, child labour or \nschool uniforms. For two key questions, in my view, that need to be stated and explored \nin more than a descriptive manner by everyone involved in this field are: who are you? \nAnd, equally importantly, Who are the girls? And if, in answering these questions, we \ncan get beyond the \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 perspective, and certainly far beyond the \u2018a girl is a \ngirl is a girl\u2019 perspective, then we might at last get to a position where we can think about \nthe extremely complex ways in which both authoritarian power and personal autonomy \nwork for different individual young women and children \u2013 whether these girls be thirteen \nyear old Tamil Tiger recruits in Sri Lanka or Bangladeshi council estate dwellers in East \nLondon.   \nThe intersections between faith, belief and politics as well as everyday experiences that \nare, often, equally applicable to boys and girls, cannot be ignored in the interpretation of \nsocial and political phenomena. If there\u2019s one thing I have learnt from teaching both boys \nand girls from a wide cross-section of classes and ethnicities and cultures in the last \nfifteen years, it is that the experiences many adults assume are the most culture-specific \nare often the least so, and the ones they elide and erase as if these are universal can \nsometimes be the least so. Thus the notion that a British-Asian girl under her burkha feels \ntotally differently about herself to a Japanese girl in a baby-doll outfit or a White Dutch \ngirl having a beer on a park bench is utterly mistaken, as is the notion that chastity means \nnothing to girls from some ethnicities and is the be all and end all of life to girls from \nothers. I set out today, intending to write about the absence of academic work in the area \nof girls\u2019 studies that addresses the experiences of non-white, non-middle-class, non-\nwestern girls and to question the reasons for this silence, this apparent assumption of a \none-size-fits all girlhood and a even more homogenous feminist response. I find, \nhowever, that I have ended up writing a plea of a certain type of research, because, if \nanything, the one thing that would be more damaging than the shocking absence of \nMuslim and Hindu or Palestinian and Tamil or Saudi and Turkish girls in research \narticles would be their presence in work which circumscribed and caricatured their \nexperiences, contexts and words.  \n \n"}
