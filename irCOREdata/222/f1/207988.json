See, for example, Potter (1996), Earnhart (1997), Tang and Tang (1999), Walker (1999). 7 The signs of the correlation coefficients with the freedom variable have been reversed since higher scores in the Freedom House data mean lower freedom. 8 Some of these agreements have been concluded so recently that either no ratifications exist yet or are so few that we needed to look at signatures instead of ratifications. This is somewhat unfortunate as a country is only bound to an agreement and therefore formally committed once it has ratified the agreement, but it cannot be mended. Experience shows, however, that often countries feel bound by their signature, even if they have never ratified the agreement for whatever reason. The prime example for this type of behaviour is the United States. Ratification encompasses as well accession, acceptance or approval of an agreement.","cites":null},{"id":17233791,"title":"A Guide to Modern Econometrics.","authors":[],"date":"2000","doi":"10.1007\/978-94-009-0137-7_11","raw":"Verbeek, Marno, 2000.

I would like to thank Marc Levy and Alex de Sherbinin for help in \ncompiling the data. I would also like to thank Henry Overman and Alan Manning for many suggestions. \nSpecial thanks go to Nils Petter Gleditsch as well as four anonymous referees for many helpful and \nconstructive comments. All errors are mine. The data used in this article can be found at \nhttp:\/\/www.prio.no\/jpr\/datasets.htm. All statistical results were generated with Intercooled Stata 6.0. \n2 \nThis article tests the hypothesis that democracies exhibit stronger international \nenvironmental commitment than non-democracies using multivariate econometric \ntechniques. A number of proxy variables are used in lieu of environmental commitment, a \nnon-observable variable. Strong evidence is found that democracies sign and ratify more \nmultilateral environmental agreements, participate in more environmental \nintergovernmental organisations, comply better with reporting requirements under the \nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora, put a greater \npercentage of their land area under protections status, are more likely to have a National \nCouncil on Sustainable Development in their country and have more environmentally \nrelevant information available than non-democracies. The findings suggest that a spread of \ndemocracy around the world will lead to enhanced environmental commitment worldwide. \nResults are robust with respect to inclusion or exclusion of developed countries in the \nsample. The use of four different variables for democracy also ensures robustness with \nrespect to the measure of democracy. The strong evidence in favour of a positive link \nbetween democracy and environmental commitment stands in contrast to the somewhat \nweak evidence on such a link between democracy and environmental outcomes. The \nexplanation presumably is that theory predicts a stronger positive link of democracy with \nenvironmental commitment than with environmental outcomes. \n3 \n'I have therefore come to believe that an essential \nprerequisite for saving the environment is the spread of \ndemocratic government to more nations of the world.' \n(Ex-US Vice President Al Gore, 1992: 179) \n \nIntroduction \nIs democracy good or bad for the environment? This is a complex question without a clear \ncut answer. As Desai (1998a: 301) concedes: \u2018whether democracies are more likely to be \nenvironmentally friendly is not entirely clear\u2019. Indeed, there is only weak statistical \nevidence in favour of democracy promoting environmental outcomes. Do democracies \nshow stronger international environmental commitment than non-democracies? This \nquestion refers only to a subset of the democracy and environment problem area, but it has \nthe advantage that it has a clear affirmative answer as the empirical analysis in this article \nwill show. \nAfter presenting some theoretical considerations on the democracy and environment \nrelationship and reviewing the relevant empirical literature, the case for focusing on \ninternational environmental commitment is put forward. The hypothesis that democracies \nexhibit stronger international environmental commitment is empirically tested and strongly \nconfirmed by the analysis. Of course, it would have been desirable to analyse more \ncomprehensively domestic environmental commitment as well. However, due to lack of \ncomparable cross-sectional data only two of the variables used in the empirical analysis of \nthis article could be interpreted as proxies for domestic environmental commitment.1 \nTherefore, while in the following I will simply speak of environmental commitment, the \n4 \nreader should keep in mind that this article\u2019s analysis really establishes a positive impact of \ndemocracy on international environmental commitment only. \n \nDemocracy and Environment: Theoretical Considerations \nPayne (1995) has provided what amounts to probably the most comprehensive theoretical \ntreatise in favour of a positive impact of democracy on the environment. The gist of his \nargument is that in democracies citizens are better informed about environmental problems \n(freedom of press) and can better express their environmental concerns and demands \n(freedom of speech), which will facilitate an organisation of environmental interests \n(freedom of association), which will in turn put pressure on policy entrepreneurs operating \nin a competitive political system to respond positively to these demands (freedom of vote), \nboth domestically as well as via international cooperation. In non-democratic systems, on \nthe other hand, governments are likely to restrict the access of their population to \ninformation, restrict the voicing of concerns and demands, restrict the organisation of \ninterests and isolate themselves from the citizens\u2019 preferences. In other words, in \ndemocracies if citizens are concerned about environmental problems this will eventually \nrequire policy makers to exhibit stronger environmental commitment to address these \nconcerns and honour the demand for environmental protection measures. \nThe same cannot be said of non-democracies, for which Chadwick (1995: 575) argues \nthat \u2018environmental signals and concerns which conflict with state development plans may \nbe silenced, and state managers may even fool themselves into thinking such concerns do \nnot exist\u2019. He further suggests that non-democracies tend to de-sensitize themselves from \nenvironmental problems concentrated in areas of the excluded and powerless populace, \nthus systematically neglecting the costs of environmental degradation. \n5 \nCongleton (1992) examines how the median voter in a democratic system and an \nauthoritarian ruler in a non-democratic system would set environmental regulations so as to \nmaximize their respective utilities. There are two relevant factors. First, Congleton assumes \nthat a shorter time horizon will lead to less strict environmental regulations. This can be \njustified by the long-term nature of many environmental problems. Since authoritarian \nrulers tend to have a shorter time horizon for fear of being thrown out of office, he predicts \nthat democracies may have stricter environmental regulations than non-democracies. \nSecond, the authoritarian ruler also appropriates a larger share of income from the \neconomy. The effect of this on the strictness of environmental regulations is ambiguous. \nOn the one hand, a larger national income share might lead to less strict regulations given \nthat such regulations are costly in terms of reducing available national income: \u2018An \nincrease in the fraction of national income going to the individual of interest increases the \nmarginal cost of environmental standards faced by him, since he will now bear a larger \nfraction of associated reductions in national income\u2019 (ibid.: 416). On the other hand, \nappropriation of a larger share of the national income might also lead to stricter \nenvironmental standards if we assume that environmental quality is a normal, if not luxury, \ngood where a higher income leads to increased demand for environmental quality. The \nresult therefore depends on the net effect. Democracy is therefore not necessarily good for \nthe environment. \nFrom a more dynamic perspective, concern has been raised with regard to the \ncompatibility of democracy and the protection of the environment. Democracies with their \nemphasis on private property rights and individual liberty provide the opportunities for \nindividuals and businesses to make full use of their potential to expand production and \nconsumption, which, if not sufficiently counter-acted by environmental regulation, will \nincrease pressure on the environment. In a slightly different vein, Desai (1998b: 11) \n6 \nsuspects that \u2018as democracy is dependent on economic development, and since economic \ngrowth and prosperity generally result in environmental pollution and ecological \ndestruction, democracy would not necessarily be protective of the environment\u2019. \nWhile there is no clear evidence on whether democratic countries as such grow faster \nthan non-democratic countries (Przeworski & Limongi, 1993; Barro, 1997; Durham, 1999), \ndemocracy is positively correlated with factors such as security of property rights (Knack & \nKeefer, 1995) and \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d (Hall & Jones, 1999) that cause good economic \nperformance. After all, all developed countries are democracies, even though the reverse is \nobviously not true. (For the purpose of this article, developed countries means the US, \nCanada, the member states of the European Union (EU-15) plus Iceland, Norway and \nSwitzerland as well as Japan, Australia and New Zealand.) \nAlso, while the view that economic growth inevitably leads to increased environmental \ndegradation across the board is overly simplistic, certain environmental problems do \nexacerbate with economic growth. Generally, while environmental problems directly \naffecting the health of a country\u2019s population are likely to improve with economic growth \n(at least after some threshold of income has been achieved), pollutants that can be \nexternalized upon the future and\/or people outside a country\u2019s boundaries are likely to \nworsen (Neumayer, 1999; Panayotou, 2000). An example for the latter would be carbon \ndioxide (CO2) emissions. \nOn a final note, it has been argued by some that it might be more difficult in \ndemocracies than in autocracies to constrain environmentally damaging economic activities \nas well as population growth since in autocracies the government does not have to pay as \nmuch attention to its citizens\u2019 rights to engage in such activities and their rights for \nprocreation. It is exactly this writers such as Hardin (1968) or Heilbronner (1974) had in \n7 \nmind in voicing their early concern on whether democracy could be relied upon to solve \nenvironmental problems. \nIn conclusion, while a good theoretical case can be made for a positive link between \ndemocracy and environment, there are a number of considerations pointing in the opposite \ndirection. The link between democracy and environment is therefore a complex one. It is \ndoubtful, to say the least, whether this complexity is fully addressed in simply entering \nincome as a control variable in empirical studies \n Unfortunately, the more theoretical contributions do not really distinguish between \nenvironmental commitment and its effect on environmental outcomes. This is not \nsurprising since the potential divide between commitment and outcomes is not recognized \nas a problem. In turning to a review of the relevant literature now we will see that most \nempirical studies have only looked at environmental outcomes and have found only weak \nevidence at best for a positive link with democracy which calls for a re-focus of empirical \nstudies on environmental commitment instead. \n \n \nReview and Critique of Existing Empirical Literature \nBoth political scientists and economists have addressed the empirical links between \ndemocracy and environment. In accordance with the unfortunate, but quite common, \ndisciplinary divide, the economists\u2019 research efforts are not recognized by political \nscientists and vice versa. Congleton (1992) represents one of the earliest empirical \ncontribution by economists. Ideally, in order to test his theory (as described in the last \nsection), he would need to address differences in domestic environmental regulation. For \nlack of data, he sees himself unable to do so and instead performs ordinary least squares \n(OLS) regressions on Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and methane emissions as well as logit \n8 \nestimates of signature of the 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone \nLayer and the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, using \nFreedom House data for the democracy variable. He finds that democratic countries, after \ncontrolling for a range of variables, are more likely to sign the Vienna Convention and the \nMontreal Protocol, but also have higher methane and CFC emissions. Murdoch & Sandler \n(1997) show, however, that while democracies might have higher absolute levels of CFC \nemissions, as indicated by Congleton (1992), democracy is also a marginally significant \ndeterminant of CFC emission reductions between 1986 and 1989.2 \nBoth Barrett & Graddy (2000) and Torras & Boyce (1998) use the panel data, with \nwhich Grossman & Krueger (1995) in their famous contribution established empirical links \nbetween a country\u2019s income level and its water and air pollution emissions (laying the \nfoundation for the so-called Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) literature).3 Barrett & \nGraddy, using Freedom House data and generalized least squares with a random effects \nestimator, find that countries with high political rights and civil liberties tend to have lower \nair and water pollution levels. Torras & Boyce, using the same data, come to similar \nfindings using OLS instead. Scruggs (1998), using Freedom House data in OLS estimation, \nfinds that democracy is statistically insignificant once one controls for income inequality in \nthe case of dissolved oxygen, fecal coliform and particulates emissions. It assumes \nstatistical significance only for the case of sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions. \nOn the part of political science, Gleditsch & Sverdrup (1996) run simple bivariate \ncorrelations, using Polity data, with a range of environmental variables, such as greenhouse \ngas emissions, extent of deforestation (both show negative correlation), signature and \nratification of environmental treaties and the presence of environmental organizations (both \nshow positive correlation). Midlarsky (1998), using Freedom House, Polity and a third data \nset based on Bollen (1993) for measuring democracy, runs multivariate OLS regressions \n9 \nwith several environmental aspects as the dependent variable, such as deforestation, CO2 \nemissions, soil erosion and land area protection. He finds that democratic countries tend to \nhave higher deforestation rates, higher CO2 emissions, possibly higher soil erosion, but also \nprotect a higher percentage of their land area. Contrary to Midlarsky (1998), Didia (1997) \nfinds that democracies have lower deforestation rates, but only simple univariate regression \nanalysis is employed. \nAll these empirical studies suffer from a number of weaknesses. No comprehensive \ncritique is attempted here, rather I will concentrate on the aspects most relevant to this \nstudy. Congleton (1992) based his analysis on data from 1988. Were he to repeat his \nanalysis with data from 2001, his attempt to arrive at significant results would be frustrated \nby the fact that both the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol have achieved \nalmost universal coverage in the meantime. What he would need to do then is to look at \nwhether democracies have signed or ratified these agreements earlier in time than non-\ndemocracies. These kind of studies have been done employing a proportional hazards \nmodel and finding that democracies, as measured by Freedom House data, are more likely \nthan non-democracies to ratify at an early stage the United Nations Framework Climate \nChange Convention (Fredriksson & Gaston, 2000) as well as the Convention on Biological \nDiversity and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and \nFlora (Neumayer, 2001). \nEven more troublesome, Congleton\u2019s original sample is likely to have been biased. \nThis is because at the early stages of multilateral action on ozone layer depletion, it was \nvery much a developed country concern as well as a phenomenon largely caused by \ndeveloped country emissions. While some developing countries were pro-active from the \nbeginning, most waited to see what developed countries were willing to offer them for \ncurtailing their future growth in consumption of ozone depleting substances (Benedick, \n10 \n1998). Consequently, in 1988 out of the 28 signatory or contracting parties to the Vienna \nConvention 19 were developed countries according to the definition used in this article. So \nwere 18 of the 29 parties to the Montreal Protocol. Because all developed countries are \ndemocracies, this leads to biased estimates. \nBarrett & Graddy (2000) group countries into low, medium and high civil and political \nfreedom, using dummy variables, as well as entering civil and political freedoms as \ncontinuous variables in separate regressions. A closer look at their results reveals that the \nstudy provides only limited evidence for a positive impact of freedom on the environment \nFirst, some of the variables have signs contrary to expectation. Second, and more \nimportantly, practically none of the dummy or continuous variables are statistically \nsignificant on their own in spite of the quite high number of observations4, which all other \nthings equal boosts significance. It is only in their combination that these variables gain \nsome statistical significance in all air pollution regressions. For the water pollution \nregressions even the combined explanatory power of the freedom variables is statistically \ninsignificant in the majority of cases. Thus, Barrett & Graddy (2000) provide at best some \nstatistical evidence for a negative link between freedom and air and water pollution. \nTorras & Boyce (1998) enter freedom only as a continuous variable and estimate \nseparate coefficients for countries above and below $5000 per capita income in purchasing \npower parity. Out of 14 regressions, the freedom coefficient has six times an unexpected \nsign, particularly prevalent in the subset of high income countries, and is statistically \ninsignificant in a further three cases. Another weakness of the study is that in spite of using \npanel data, no time-series for the freedom variable is constructed. Instead the freedom \nvariable is set equal to the 1995 value throughout. The empirical evidence resulting from \ntheir study is therefore not particularly strong either. Unfortunately, the two studies are not \n11 \ndirectly comparable with each other since differing statistical techniques are used and \nTorras & Boyce (1998) also control for income inequality and literacy. \n \n \nThe Case for Focusing on Environmental Commitment \nThe more general problem with much of the empirical literature is that it focuses too much \non environmental outcomes instead of looking at environmental commitment. Take \nMidlarsky\u2019s (1998) examination of CO2 emissions and soil degradation as an example. It \nsuffers from the same kind of problem as Torras & Boyce (1998) and Barrett & Graddy \n(2000), which similarly concentrate on environmental outcomes. Why would we expect \ndemocracies to have more or less severe soil degradation? Soil degradation depends on a \nplethora of factors including natural ones, most of which have absolutely nothing to do \nwith democracy. No wonder then that no robust statistical relationship can be established. \nYes, we would expect democratic countries to engage more in an international agreement \naddressing soil erosion, if there was one. We would also expect democratic countries to \nengage more in activities stemming the spread of soil erosion. But we would not \nnecessarily expect them to have less soil degradation, at least not until many years have \npassed and the prevention activities referred to above have had an impact. Similarly with \nrespect to CO2 emissions. Why would we expect a significant relationship here? As argued \nabove, it is the quintessential example of an environmental problem that can be \nexternalised upon the future and people outside a country\u2019s boundaries. It is also strongly \ninfluenced by economic growth and the historic mix of primary energy types in use. Both \nare difficult for policy makers to control. Midlarsky (1998) finds a strong statistically \nsignificant relationship with only one of his democracy variables, namely the Polity \nvariable. Even this result is most likely an artefact of functional mis-specification, \n12 \nhowever. As simple a transformation as including squared and cubic GDP per capita in the \nestimation (a standard procedure in the relevant EKC literature), renders the Polity variable \ninsignificant.5 Again, we would expect democracies to more actively engage in a MEA \naddressing global warming such as the Kyoto Protocol (and further below we will see that \nthey actually do), but only years or decades later will this translate into a statistically \nsignificant relationship with CO2 emissions (but, of course, with respect to growth rates of \nemissions and not with respect to absolute levels, as modelled by Midlarsky, 1998). \nHence, at best there is to be expected only a weak link between democracy and (some) \nenvironmental outcomes. This is the ultimate reason, I would submit, why studies \nexamining the impact of democracy on environmental outcomes in general provide only \nweak statistical evidence.6 Interestingly, the outcome variables for which Torras & Boyce \n(1998) find the strongest evidence for a significant relationship with democracy are smoke \nemissions and fecal coliform effluents \u2013 two variables that do not suffer from severe time \nlags between commitment and outcome, that are well within the control of policy makers, \nthat strongly affect the health of citizens and success is easily monitored by the electorate. \nSimilarly, the only dependent environmental outcome variable for which Midlarsky (1998) \nfinds a relatively significant relationship with democracy, namely deforestation, is also the \none, where he can put forward a relatively plausible theoretical argument establishing such \na link. \nA much stronger theoretical argument can be made for a positive relationship between \ndemocracy and environmental commitment. In democracies people can express their \nenvironmental preferences better, these preferences will be honoured or addressed better by \npolicy makers and this should translate into stronger revealed environmental commitment. \nBut it need not translate into better environmental outcomes. The link between democracy \nand environmental outcomes is likely to be weaker the more factors outside a government\u2019s \n13 \ncontrol impact upon outcomes, the longer the time span between environmental \ncommitment and its effect on environmental outcomes is and the more difficult \nenvironmental outcomes are to monitor. If these conditions hold true, then the electorate in \na democracy will appreciate the difficulty of holding governments accountable for \nenvironmental outcomes rather than commitment and will look for commitment instead. \nWhat needs to be done therefore is to re-adjust the focus away from environmental \noutcomes and towards environmental commitment. Congleton (1992) in principle \naddresses environmental commitment, but his analysis has serious weaknesses as seen \nabove. In one of his variables, namely protected land area (a variable included in this study \nas well), Midlarsky (1998) himself looks at environmental commitment rather than \noutcomes. So do Gleditsch & Sverdrup (1996) in some of their variables, but simple \nbivariate analysis is often misleading and sensitive to the inclusion of control variables. In \nsome sense therefore this work builds upon and extends these earlier attempts. It tries to \nprovide a comprehensive and robust empirical analysis of the impact of democracy on \nenvironmental commitment. \n \n \nFour Measures of Democracy \nWhat exactly is democracy and how can it be measured best? This is difficult to answer \nand it would be vastly beyond the scope of this article to provide an original contribution to \nthis complex question. Instead, I will simply employ four different measures of democracy \nthat are implicitly based on different conceptions of what constitutes democracy and hope \nthat together they cover comprehensively the complexity of democracy. Connected to this, \nthe use of four different measures is also motivated by a desire to ensure robustness of the \nresults. We put more confidence in the results if they hold true independent of the specific \n14 \nmeasure of democracy chosen. If not, then this would have to be explained at least with \nreference to differences in the underlying conception of democracy. If no satisfactory \nexplanation could be given, it would also put the results themselves into doubt. The four \nmeasures of democracy to be used in this study are: \n \n\u2022 A combined index of political rights and civil liberties based on Freedom House data. \n\u2022 A combined index of democracy and autocracy based on the Polity project. \n\u2022 Vanhanen\u2019s index of democracy based on the so-called polyarchy dataset. \n\u2022 A governance indicator named \u201cvoice and accountability\u201d, developed by World Bank \nstaff. \n \nWhile, obviously and expectedly so, there is positive correlation among the various \nmeasures of democracy, it is less than perfect (see appendix 1).7 More importantly, each \nmeasure is based on a somewhat different conception of what constitutes democracy. The \nFreedom House data are based on expert assessments of the extent to which a country \neffectively provides for political rights and civil liberties, both measured on a 1 to 7 scale \n(Karatnycky, 1999: 546-553). Political rights refer to, for example, the existence and \nfairness of elections, existence of opposition and the possibility to take over power via \nelections. Civil liberties refer to, for example, the freedom of assembly, the right to open \nand free discussion, the independence of media, protection from political terror and the \nprevalence of the rule of law. \nThe Polity data are also based on expert judgement on aspects of institutionalized \ndemocracy and autocracy within a country, both measured on an additive 0 to 10 scale \n(Jaggers & Gurr, 1995). The criteria of assessment for the democracy score include the \ncompetitiveness of political participation (1-3), the competitiveness (1-2) and openness (1) \n15 \nof executive recruitment as well as the constraints on the chief executive (1-4). The \nautocracy score consists of restrictions on the competitiveness (1-2) and regulation (1-2) of \npolitical participation, the restrictions on the competitiveness (1-2) and lack of openness \n(1) of executive recruitment and the lack of constraints on the chief executive (1-3). \nThe governance indicator combines seven indicators measuring, for example, the \nextent of civil liberties, political rights and independence of media, the involvement of \nmilitary forces in politics and the responsiveness of government to its people as well as \ntransparency of government decisions particularly with respect to decisions affecting and \nconcerning business (Kaufmann, Kraay & Zoido-Lobat\u00f3n, 1999a, b). Some of these base \nindicators stem from expert assessments, others from surveys of entrepreneurs. One of the \nindicators entering is the Freedom House indicator. Hence there is some overlap between \nthe two. Because the indicators differ in their coverage of countries and therefore in their \n\u201crepresentativeness\u201d, they are combined into one single indicator through a linear \nunobserved components model. It is standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard \ndeviation of one. \nFinally, contrary to the other measures the data for the Vanhanen (2000) index are not \nbased on expert evaluations. It consists of two variables: a competition variable, calculated \nby subtracting the percentage of votes won by the largest party from 100, and a \nparticipation variable, taken as the percentage of the total population participating in \nelections. A democracy variable is then constructed as the product of the competition and \nthe participation variable divided by 100. The multiplication is because Vanhanen, like \nDahl (1971), regards both competition and participation as necessary requirements for \ndemocracy; adding the two variables up would have implied instead that a high score on \none variable can compensate for a low score on the other. \n \n16 \n \nThe Dependent Variables and the Hypotheses to be Tested \nOf course, environmental commitment is a non-observable variable. I therefore use a range \nof variables, which are supposed to function as proxy variables. More specifically, these \nvariables include: \n \n\u2022 The signing and ratification of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). \n\u2022 The membership in environmental intergovernmental organisations (EIOs). \n\u2022 The extent to which reporting requirements for the Convention on International Trade \nin Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) are met. \n\u2022 The percentage of a country\u2019s land area under protection status. \n\u2022 The existence of a National Council on Sustainable Development (NCSD) in a country. \n\u2022 The availability of environmentally relevant information concerning a country. \n \nOur basic hypothesis to be tested throughout is that democratic countries are more \nenvironmentally committed as measured by these proxy variables than non-democratic \ncountries.  \n \nMultilateral environmental agreements and environmental intergovernmental \norganisations \nOne revelation of environmental commitment is the signing and ratification of MEAs. Of \nthe more than 180 or so existing MEAs only few are suitable for our purpose here. First, \nmany of these MEAs are regional rather than global. Second, we want to look here at \nMEAs that do not have quasi-universal membership. This is because it is exactly these \n17 \nMEAs where environmental commitment is needed on behalf of countries to join. MEAs \nwith quasi-universal membership, on the other hand, are often agreements that can be \njoined without commitment to incurring any costly action, where costs could be either \nmonetary or opportunity costs. \nHaving examined a great many MEAs, I decided to pick four that fulfil these criteria: \nthe Kyoto Protocol (84 signatures as of 27 November 2000; www.unfccc.org), the \nCopenhagen Amendment to the Montreal Protocol (115 ratifications as of 8 December \n2000; www.unep.org\/ozone), the Rotterdam Convention (73 signatures as of 17 January \n2001; www.chem.unep.ch); and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (81 signatures as of \n22 December 2000; www.biodiv.org).8 These agreements cover four important areas of \nrecent multilateral environmental concern, namely climate change, ozone layer depletion, \ntrade in hazardous chemicals and pesticides, and danger to biodiversity posed by \ngenetically modified organisms.9 Data on the status of signature and ratification are from \nthe homepages of the respective MEAs. A dummy for each MEA was created, which was \nset to 1 if a country had signed (or ratified in the case of the Montreal Amendment) the \nagreement and 0 otherwise. \nWhether a country signs a particular MEA obviously depends on a great many factors \nthat might differ from MEA to MEA. In looking at the four MEAs taken together, we \nwould therefore hope to get a more systematic result on what factors impact upon a \ncountry's willingness to sign or ratify MEAs. A further variable was therefore created as the \nsum of the dummy variables for the MEAs, so that it ranges from 0 to 4 depending on how \nmany of these MEAs a country has signed\/ratified, if any. \nEnvironmentally committed countries can also be expected to participate strongly in \nenvironmental intergovernmental organisations (EIOs) for the same kind of reasoning that \nleads us to expect that they are more willing to sign and ratify MEAs than non-committed \n18 \ncountries. The number of memberships in EIOs as of 1998 is taken from WEF (2001, \nannex 6), based on a codification of 100 intergovernmental organisations as \n\u201cenvironmental\u201d and data from the Yearbook of International Organisations.10 This leads \nus to our first two hypotheses to be tested: \n \nH1: Democracies are more likely to sign or ratify MEAs than non-democracies. \nH2: Democracies participate in more EIOs than non-democracies. \n \nCITES reporting requirements \nBesides the signing and ratification of MEAs a good test for the extent of environmental \ncommitment is a country\u2019s compliance with the requirements of a MEA. Those \nrequirements are usually costly to comply with, hence more committed countries will be \nmore willing to incur the costs. Unfortunately, quantitative compliance data for a large \nsample of countries is usually not available. However, there is one MEA for which such \ndata exist, namely the percentage of reporting requirements CITES parties have met. Data \nas of 1997 are from WRI (2000, table BI.4). This leads us to our third hypothesis: \n \nH3: Democracies meet a higher percentage of their reporting requirements under CITES \nthan non-democracies. \n \nLand area under protection status \nLand area under protection status is another variable concerned with more traditional \nnature conservation and wildlife protection. Data on the percentage of land area a country \nhas put under protection according to any of the five management categories of the \n19 \nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as of 1997 come from WRI \n(2000, table BI.1). We postulate as our fourth hypothesis: \n \nH4: Democracies put a higher percentage of their land area under protection status than \nnon-democracies. \n \nPresence of a National Council on Sustainable Development \nIn the wake of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, many countries started to set up a \nNational Council on Sustainable Development (NCSD) (132 countries as of 9 February \n2001 had such a council; www.ecouncil.ac.cr). A dummy was created, which was set to 1 if \na country had a NCSD, and 0 otherwise. The objective of these councils is the promotion \nand implementation of sustainable development at the national level, thus translating \nAgenda 21 into national strategies. The NCSDs can be regarded as the country level \ncounterpart to the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), \nwhich was established after the Earth Summit. In almost all countries the NCSD is set up \nand coordinated by some governmental agency. The existence of a NCSD can thus be \ninterpreted as a sign for a country\u2019s environmental commitment. This leads us to the \nfollowing hypothesis: \n \nH5: Democracies are more likely to have a National Council on Sustainable Development \nthan non-democracies. \n \nAvailability of environmentally relevant information \nLack of standardized and internationally comparable environmentally relevant information \nhas long since represented a problem to researchers. While very often information \n20 \ncollection is undertaken by international organisations with relatively little influence of the \ndomestic country, we would nevertheless expect an environmentally committed country to \nactively seek provision of environmentally relevant information, if only for the purpose of \nits own domestic environmental policy making. This could take place either via own data \ncollection or via encouraging international organisations to undertake the research \nnecessary for information provision in their country. \nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) has commissioned an Environmental \nSustainability Index (ESI), which aggregates 67 variables. While not all variables have a \ndirect link to the environment, taken together they provide a good indication of a country\u2019s \nenvironmental sustainability potential. Information is not available for all the 67 variables \nfor all the 122 countries covered (data taken from WEF, 2001, annex 6). We would expect \nthat in the case of an environmentally committed country information on fewer variables \nare missing and therefore postulate our sixth hypothesis: \n \nH6: Democracies have more variables available in the set of ESI variables than non-\ndemocracies. \n \nAppendix 2 provides a Pearson correlation matrix for the dependent variables (in case of \nMEAs only the summary variable is included). The correlation coefficients are all positive \nas expected, which is important since after all they are all supposed to proxy the same \nunderlying non-observable phenomenon environmental commitment. At the same time, the \ncorrelations are nowhere near 100%. Anything else would suggest redundancy among the \nproxy variables. \n \n21 \nThe Independent Variables \nTurning to the independent variables, as concerns the democracy variables, I have grouped \ncountries together and used discrete dummy variables rather than a continuous variable \nthroughout. Use of dummy variables allows for easier interpretation and understanding of \nthe statistical results. One disadvantage of dummy variable use is a loss of variation in the \nexplanatory variables, which usually brings with it greater standard errors in the estimation \nresults. Another problem is the somewhat arbitrary fixation of the dummy variable \nboundaries. For the purpose of sensitivity analysis all regressions have therefore been run \nwith democracy entered as a continuous variable and with changes in the boundaries of the \ndummy variables within a reasonable range (results not reported). For practically all \nregressions reported further below, entering democracy as a continuous variable has \nconfirmed their results with higher statistical significance. Furthermore, results were \nlargely unaffected by modest changes in the boundaries for the dummy variables. \nAs concerns the Freedom House variables, both their political rights and their civil \nliberty index runs on a 1 to 7 scale. I have added up the two to create a continuous variable \non a 2 to 14 scale. For the dummy variables, I have followed Freedom House in classifying \ncountries into three groups in accordance with their classification of countries as not free, \npartly free and free. In general, countries are considered not free if their added score is \nbetween 11 and 14, as partly free if the score is between 6 and 11, and as free if the score is \nbetween 2 and 6. As can be seen, there is some ambiguity if countries have a score of either \n6 or 11 and Freedom House uses additional information not included in the score in order \nto group countries then. I therefore created a dummy variable FREE-low, which was set to \n1 if the country was classified by Freedom House as not free, and 0 otherwise, a dummy \nFREE-mid, which was set to 1 if the country was classified as partly free, and 0 otherwise \n22 \nas well as FREE-high, which was set equal to 1 if the country was considered free, and 0 \notherwise. Data come from Freedom House (2000). \nAs concerns the Polity data, the original data set provides two indices on a 0 to 10 \nscale, one for the extent of a country\u2019s democratic and the other for its autocratic \ncharacteristics. I followed Hauge & Ellingsen (1998) in putting countries into three groups. \nA dummy variable POLIT-low was created, which was set to 1 if the subtraction of the \nautocracy score from the democracy score in 1998 led to a result between \u201310 and \u20136, and \n0 otherwise. Similarly, a POLIT-mid dummy was set to 1 if this result was between \u20135 and \n5, and 0 otherwise and a POLIT-high dummy, set to 1 if the result was above 5, and 0 \notherwise. Data are from Gurr & Jaggers (2000). \nThe governance indicator developed by World Bank staff is standardized to have a \nmean of zero and a standard deviation of about one, with a minimum of about -1.8 and a \nmaximum of about 1.7. I have constructed a dummy variable GOV-low, which was set to 1 \nif this indicator was below -.8, and 0 otherwise; a GOV-mid dummy, which was set to 1 if \nthe indicator was between -.8 than 0, and 0 otherwise; and a GOV-high dummy, which was \nset to 1 if the indicator was above 0, and 0 otherwise.11 Data come from Kaufmann, Kraay \n& Zoido-Lobat\u00f3n (1999a, b). \nFollowing Vanhanen (2000: 257), I have constructed a VAN-autoc dummy variable, \nwhich is set to 1 if the competition variable is below 30, the participation value below 10 \nor the democracy variable below 5, and 0 otherwise. A VAN-demo dummy variable is set \nto 1 if VAN-autoc is equal to 0 and vice versa. The reader should note that the relevant \ndummy categories exhaust the full array of countries in order to facilitate reference to any \none group of countries, but that for all estimations one of the dummy categories was left \nout, of course, to avoid the so-called dummy variable trap. \n23 \nBesides democracy (our hypothesis to be tested), which other factors would one \ntheoretically expect to impact upon the environmental commitment of a country? First, per \ncapita income should have a positive impact upon environmental commitment. In \neconomic terms this would mean that environmental commitment is a luxury good with an \nincome elasticity greater than one.12 This need not imply that poor countries care less about \nthe environment per se. Rather, because of their poverty they might prioritize issues other \nthan the environment. Income per capita is measured as gross domestic product (GDP) per \ncapita in purchasing power parity (PPP) in US$ in 1998, taken from UNDP (2000).13 \nSecond, big and \u201cimportant\u201d countries should be more environmentally committed \nthan small and \u201cunimportant\u201d ones. As a proxy for this variable one could either take a \ncountry\u2019s total income or population since, all other things equal, both the economic and \nthe population size of a country should be positively correlated with \u201cimportance\u201d. Since \nper capita income is already included and controlled for, I decided to use population size as \na proxy.14 More important countries might show signs of stronger environmental \ncommitment not necessarily due to stronger environmental concern per se. Rather, we \nhypothesize here that these countries will find it in their interest to demonstrate \nenvironmental commitment, particularly with respect to certain proxy variables for \ncommitment, in order to demonstrate their importance in world politics, of which the \nenvironment represents one part. In other words, important countries want to be seen as \ngood citizens and leaders in world environmental affairs.15 Data on the size of a country\u2019s \npopulation and its population density (population divided by land area in square \nkilometres) in 1998, which is additionally used in one estimation, stem from World Bank \n(2000). Appendix 3 provides summary descriptive statistics for all independent and \ndependent variables, apart from the binary dummy variables for the individual MEAs and \nthe existence of a NCSD. \n24 \n \nStatistical Issues \nBefore results are presented, a short discussion of potential statistical problems seems \nwarranted. Because of the huge variation in GDP per capita and in population size among \ncountries, which could potentially lead to heteroscedasticity, the two variables entered the \nregressions as their natural logs. Cook-Weisberg tests sometimes still found evidence for \nheteroscedasticity, however. For that reason all regressions were run with \nheteroscedasticity robust standard errors. \nTwo of the dependent variables, namely \u201c% of CITES reporting requirements met\u201d and \n\u201c% of land area under protection\u201d might cause problems in OLS estimation. While none of \nthem is censored, the fact that the dependent variable is equal to 0 (as well as 100 in case of \nCITES) for a few countries might nevertheless bias OLS estimates. Tobit estimation, a \nmaximum likelihood technique suitable for dealing with limited dependent variables, was \ntherefore run as well for these two variables. As the results were very similar, only the OLS \nestimates are shown below.16 \nDeveloped countries tend to be environmentally committed in the sense that they \ngenerally fare well on our proxy indicators. Since, according to the definition used in this \narticle, all developed countries are democracies this represents a potential problem. If we \nfind that democracy is a significant explanatory variable for environmental commitment, \nthen this result might be triggered in part by the presence of developed countries in the \nsample. In spite of controlling already for income per capita, which is highly correlated \nwith a country being developed or not, I have therefore run most regressions twice: once \nfor the full sample and once for a subset excluding developed countries. Doing so also \nallows one to examine whether multicollinearity between income and the democracy \nvariables poses a serious problem. Table I shows the correlation between lnGDP, the \n25 \nincome variable, and the four variables of democracy both for the full and for the restricted \nsample.17 As can be seen, the correlation coefficients are much lower for the restricted \nsample. \n \n< Insert Table I here > \n \nBecause of the presumed sign of the democracy variables, in principle one-tailed \nsignificance tests could have been reported. Instead, I decided to report two-tailed tests, but \nto take a rather high threshold of 10% as an indication of statistical significance. All OLS \nregressions were run with a constant included, even though its coefficient is not reported \nbelow. N, the number of observations, varies across the various regressions. For the same \ndependent variable, N varies due to variances in the availability of the democracy \nmeasures. For different dependent variables, N varies due to variances in the availability of \nthe dependent variable. \n \n \nResults \nMultilateral environmental agreements and environmental intergovernmental \norganisations \nTable II reports the results of probit estimates for each of the four MEAs.18 The reported \ncoefficients are already changes in the probability at the mean of a variable, not the \nuntransformed probit coefficients. For our dummy variables the coefficient gives the \nprobability for a discrete change of the dummy variable from 0 to 1. Only the results for the \nFreedom House democracy variable are shown. Results for the other three democracy \nvariables can be found in appendix 4. \n26 \n \n< Insert Table II here > \n \nAs concerns the Kyoto Protocol, all coefficients have the expected sign and all \ndemocracy coefficients are statistically significant. To understand the correct interpretation \nof the coefficients of the democracy variables, refer to the estimate for the full sample case. \nThe estimate for these two dummy variables means that after controlling for differences in \nper capita income and a country\u2019s population size, FREE-low countries are 42% less likely \nto have signed the Kyoto Protocol than FREE-high countries. Similarly, FREE-mid \ncountries are 35% less likely to have signed.19 \nAs concerns the Biosafety Protocol, all coefficients have the expected sign. The FREE-\nmid dummy is statistically insignificant in the restricted sample on its own, but gains \nsignificance in combination with the FREE-low dummy. With respect to the Rotterdam \nConvention, while the democracy coefficients have the expected signs they are statistically \ninsignificant throughout both on their own and combined. No results for the restricted \nsample are shown as in these cases a Wald test failed to reject the hypothesis that the \nexplanatory variables taken together have no explanatory power for the POLIT and GOV \nvariables and only marginal power for the FREE variables. As concerns the Copenhagen \nAmendment to the Montreal Protocol, all coefficients have the expected signs. The FREE-\nmid variable is insignificant in the restricted sample on its own, but gains combined \nsignificance with the FREE-low dummy. \nTable III provides an ordered probit estimate for the sum of MEAs variable. Ordered \nprobit is suitable for ordinally ordered data. While a country with a score of 4 cannot be \nsaid to exhibit double the environmental commitment as a country scoring 2, it can be said \nto exhibit a higher commitment. In other words the sum of MEAs can be interpreted as an \n27 \nordinal variable, where 4 can be interpreted as excellent, 3 as good, 2 as satisfactory, 1 as \npoor and 0 as very poor commitment. For reasons of space availability, only the results for \nthe restricted sample are shown here.20 All coefficients have the expected sign and are \nstatistically significant on their own, apart from the POLIT-mid variable, which gains \nsignificance only in combination. The coefficients from ordered probit estimates have no \ndirect meaning. Together with information on the so-called cut points (not reported), they \ncan be used to compute predicted probabilities, however. Such probabilities are shown for \nillustrative purposes for the FREE dummy variables only. While, for example, FREE-low \ncountries have a predicted probability of 14% of having signed three MEAs (a sign for \ngood commitment), the respective probability for FREE-high countries is much higher at \n34%. \n \n<Insert Table III here> \n \nTurning to the number of environmental intergovernmental organisations a country \nparticipates in, Table IV presents OLS estimate results. All coefficients have the expected \nsign apart from the POLIT-mid variables, which are statistically insignificant, however. \nThe GOV-mid dummy is statistically insignificant in the restricted sample, but gains \nsignificance in combination. The VAN-autoc variables are insignificant in both samples, if \nonly marginally so. A correct interpretation of the coefficients with reference to the full \nsample is that FREE-low countries on average participate in 3.38 and FREE-mid countries \nin 3.07 EIOs less than FREE-high countries. Interpretation of the other coefficients \nreported in Table IV is analogous. \n \n<Insert Table IV here> \n28 \n \nCITES reporting requirements \nOLS estimate results for the percentage of CITES reporting requirements met as the \ndependent variable can be found in Table V. All coefficients have the expected signs and \nare statistically significant, apart from FREE-mid and POLIT-mid, which are not \nsignificant on their own, but in their combination with FREE-low and POLIT-low. The \ncorrect interpretation of the coefficients of the democracy variables is illustrated again with \nrespect to the estimate for the FREE variables in the full sample case. FREE-low countries \nhave on average an estimated 23 percentage points and FREE-mid countries an estimated 9 \npercentage points lower reporting rate than FREE-high countries. \n \n<Insert Table V here> \n \nLand area under protection status \nOLS estimate results for the percentage of land area under protection status as the \ndependent variable can be found in Table VI. For this regression only, a country\u2019s \npopulation density was added as an explanatory variable. The expectation is that a country \nwith a lower population density can afford to put a higher percentage of its territory under \nprotection status than a country with a high population density. The income variable is \nsometimes and the population variable is throughout statistically insignificant. The \ndemocracy and the population density variables have the expected signs and are \nstatistically significant throughout. Referring to the FREE variables in the full sample case, \nFREE-low countries have on average an estimated 5.87 and FREE-mid countries an \nestimated 5.96 percentage points of their total land area less under protection status in \n29 \ncomparison to FREE-high countries. Interpretation for the other reported results in this \ntable is analogous. \n \n<Insert Table VI here> \n \nExistence of a National Council on Sustainable Development (NCSD) \nTable VII provides probit estimation results for the existence of a NCSD. All coefficients \nhave the expected sign. All democracy coefficients are statistically significant, apart from \nFREE-mid and POLIT-mid, which only gain combined significance with the FREE-low \nand POLIT-low dummies. Referring to the full sample case, FREE-low countries are \nestimated to have a 30% lower likelihood for the existence of a NCSD than FREE-high \ncountries. Interpretation for the other democracy variables is analogous. \n \n<Insert Table VII here> \n \nAvailability of environmentally relevant information \nLastly, OLS estimate results for the number of ESI variables available as the dependent \nvariable can be found in Table VIII. All coefficients have the expected sign and are highly \nstatistically significant, which leads to high R2 values throughout. Referring to the FREE \nvariables in the full sample case, FREE-low countries have on average an estimated 4.1 \nESI variables and FREE-mid countries an estimated 2.5 ESI variables less available than \nFREE-high countries. Interpretation for the other reported results in this table is analogous. \n \n< Insert Table VIII here > \n \n30 \n \nDiscussion and Concluding Observations \nTaken together, the results reported in the last section provide strong evidence in favour of \nour hypothesis that democracies exhibit stronger international environmental commitment \nthan non-democracies. This result appears to be relatively robust with respect to our \ndifferent measures of environmental commitment. For the great majority of these proxies \nof environmental commitment the democracy variables not only have the expected sign, \nbut are also statistically significant. It is also quite robust with respect to our different \nmeasures of democracy. No single measure of democracy provides systematically different \nestimates in terms of sign of coefficients and their statistical significance from the other \nthree.21 Equally satisfying is that the coefficients and their significance remain roughly the \nsame whether developed countries are included in the full sample or excluded in the \nrestricted sample. In other words, the results are not simply triggered by the presence of \ndeveloped democratic countries. \nAlmost throughout we observe that the coefficients for the FREE-low, POLIT-low and \nGOV-low countries indicate less environmental commitment at stronger statistical \nsignificance than the coefficients for the FREE-mid, POLIT-mid and GOV-mid countries. \nIn other words, clearly undemocratic countries exhibit even less environmental \ncommitment than countries in the middle group and we can be more certain that their \ncommitment differs significantly from clear democracies than we can be for the group in \nbetween. This was to be expected of course. \nIn conclusion, this study provides a positive message: Democracies clearly show \nstronger environmental commitment than non-democracies. All other things equal, \ntherefore, a more democratic world will also be a world with stronger environmental \ncommitment. This need not translate into better environmental outcomes, however, at least \n31 \nnot immediately. Theory predicts a stronger link of democracy with environmental \ncommitment than with outcomes. Gleditsch & Sverdrup (1995: 8) suspect this much when \nthey write that \u2018the crucial point is that regardless of what harm democracies may do to the \nenvironment, they are more likely to make corrective action\u2019. As democracy spreads \naround the world, so will environmental commitment. More environmental commitment \nwill help preventing environmental scarcities from leading to extreme outcomes like \nviolent conflict. There is thus another avenue through which democracy can foster peace. \nInterestingly, it is really democracy or political freedom that matters. Pre-testing \nrejected economic freedom as a relevant variable. Just because a country limits its \ninterference in the economic system and allows its people to engage freely in doing \nbusiness, does not render it environmentally committed. But allowing its people to receive \nindependent information, to voice and organise their concerns and to dis-elect policy \nmakers for failure to address citizens\u2019 preferences leads to enhanced environmental \ncommitment. \nThis is not to say that democracies do not suffer from deficiencies and even failures \nwith respect to environmental commitment. For example, future generations are affected by \nenvironmental degradation, but cannot express their preferences in the political market \nplace of the present. Environmental degradation cuts across national boundaries, which is \nlikely to lead to excessive global environmental pollution in the absence of a central \npolitical authority (world government). Environmental degradation also cuts across \nadministrative boundaries within nation-states, which renders policies successfully \naddressing these problems more difficult (Doeleman 1997). But the point is that non-\ndemocracies equally suffer from these deficiencies, if not more. While democracy is less \nthan perfect, there is no better alternative. \n32 \nOf course, democracy is not a static concept and it evolves over time. Some argue that \nthe modern Western model of representative democracy with infrequent elections, \nsubstantial influence of lobby groups benefiting from environmental degradation, little \nmobilisation of the people and limited participation outside well defined and narrow \nboundaries is ill equipped to deal with long-term environmental problems and therefore \nneeds to be transformed into a more \u201cdeliberative\u201d or \u201cassociative\u201d democracy (Lafferty & \nMeadowcroft, 1996; Doeleman, 1997). Addressing these issues is beyond the limits of this \narticle, however, and is left to future research. Suffice it to say here that, again, while \nrepresentative democracy might not be perfect, it is surely better than any non-democratic \nalternative. \n \n33 \nAppendix 1.

See, for example, Potter \n(1996), Earnhart (1997), Tang and Tang (1999), Walker (1999). \n7\n The signs of the correlation coefficients with the freedom variable have been reversed since higher scores in the \nFreedom House data mean lower freedom. \n8\n Some of these agreements have been concluded so recently that either no ratifications exist yet or are so few \nthat we needed to look at signatures instead of ratifications. This is somewhat unfortunate as a country is only \nbound to an agreement and therefore formally committed once it has ratified the agreement, but it cannot be \nmended. Experience shows, however, that often countries feel bound by their signature, even if they have never \nratified the agreement for whatever reason. The prime example for this type of behaviour is the United States. \nRatification encompasses as well accession, acceptance or approval of an agreement. \n9\n Somewhat unfortunate is a lack of an agreement more directly addressing nature and wildlife conservation. The \nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora, which would otherwise be a good \ncandidate, has quasi-universal membership (152 parties as of 22 March 2000). Fortunately, however, two of our \nother proxy variables for environmental commitment are connected to nature conservation and wildlife \nprotection. \n10\n The list of organisations coded as environmental is available from the author on request. \n11\n The cut-off points were chosen with a view to allocate about the same number of countries into the three \ndifferent groups as is the case for the FREE and POLIT dummy variables. \n12\n One might wonder whether income squared should be included as an independent variable as well to allow for \na non-linear effect of income on environmental commitment. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) literature \noften includes such a term finding that environmental outcomes first worsen with rising income until a threshold \nis reached after which they improve with rising incomes. However, this non-linearity is mainly due to changes in \n51 \n                                                                                                                                                        \nthe sectoral composition of an economy during the process of industrialisation and there is no reason to presume \nthat similar non-linearity exists with respect to environmental commitment. Nevertheless, in non-reported \nsensitivity analysis I tried inclusion of squared income. As expected, in almost all cases it tested insignificant. \n13\n For a few countries, the income data stem from years earlier than 1998. The bias is likely to be very small and \nwould not have justified taking these countries out of the sample. \n14\n Total income and population cannot be used simultaneously as this would lead to perfect multicollinearity \ngiven that per capita income is another explanatory variable. \n15\n An anonymous referee raised the question how the United States, which regularly fails to sign or ratify \nmultilateral environmental agreements, fits into this proposition. In my view, the US represents a very special \ncase. It is without doubt the foremost power in world politics and in some sense the only world power. It does not \nneed to demonstrate its importance and therefore can easily get away with failing to demonstrate international \nenvironmental commitment. On the other hand, lesser countries with an ambition to demonstrate their importance \n(for example, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Russia) often find themselves compelled to show \ncommitment whether they are convinced of the environmental cause or not. \n16\n For the variable \u201c% of land area under protection\u201d an upper limit was set equal to 25. This is because higher \nreported percentages seemed somewhat implausible. Again, the estimated results were very similar. \n17\n The signs of the correlation coefficients with the freedom variable have been reversed since higher scores in \nthe Freedom House data mean lower freedom. \n18\n Alternatively, logit estimates could have been undertaken. The two techniques provide very similar results \n(Verbeek, 2000). \n19\n An anonymous referee suggests that the decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol might be mainly determined by \nwhether a country is a net exporter or importer of fossil fuels. In sensitivity analysis the net fossil fuel import \nposition as a percentage of commercial energy use was entered as a further control variable (data taken from \nWorld Bank, 2000). While the coefficient of this variable is positive as expected and statistically significant \nthroughout, income, democracy and population size remain statistically significant determinants for the Kyoto \nProtocol (detailed results not reported). \n20\n Results for the full sample convey the same message with higher statistical significance. \n52 \n                                                                                                                                                        \n21\n One might think that the VAN dummy fares best throughout in terms of significance. However, this dummy \ncannot be directly compared to the other variables of democracy, as the former is a dichotomous variable, \nwhereas the latter are trichotomous. \n"}
