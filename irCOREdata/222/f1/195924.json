This discrepancy can be partially explained by the fact that a \nsingle gene can potentially encode a number of protein products due to alternative mRNA \nsplicing. Alternative mRNA splicing is an important mechanism for generating protein \ndiversity. Indeed, recent microarray analyses suggest that around 40% of Drosophila genes \n[2] and >90% of human genes undergo alternative splicing [3].  \nAlternative splicing is the process by which exons (or even introns) can be either included or \nexcluded from a precursor-mRNA (pre-mRNA) resulting in multiple, mature mRNA variants. \nThis process is carried out by a large complex, the spliceosome, which is a supramolecular \nassembly consisting of 5 small nucl ar ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) [4]. The process \nis governed by: (i) various cis-acting elements encoded in the pre-mRNA sequence itself (the \n5\u2019 and 3\u2019 splice sites, branch points, exon c and intronic enhancer\/silencer sites (ESE\/ESS, \nISE\/ISS)); (ii) trans-acting elements, specific proteins that recognize particular ESE\/ESS or \nISE\/ISS and bind to them (serine\/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and heterogeneous \nribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs)) and; (iii) cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms. The final \noutcome of alternative splicing is translation of isoformic variants of proteins, encoded by the \nsame gene, but differing in sequence and therefore potentially in their biomolecular and \ncellular properties. In addition, if alternative splicing of mRNA leads to the introduction of a \npremature stop codon some of these mRNAs are not translated to proteins, but undergo \nnonsense-mediated decay (NMD) [5]. Proteins affected by alternative splicing might have \nunaltered function, altered function, or no function at all. Splicing that generates non-\nfunctional isoforms might have a significant impact on susceptibility to, and development of a \nrange of illnesses (e.g. muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, asthma, insulin-dependent (type I) \ndiabetes, cancer [6]). In addition, mutations that lead to alterations in the splicing of various \nproteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), have been identified in a variety of \ncancers, including melanomas, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver and gastrointestinal cancers [7, \n8, 9]. \nPage 2 of 35Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n3 \n \nGPCRs constitute the largest family of membrane-associated receptors. A key feature of the \nGPCR family is that different receptor subtypes have evolved that can specifically detect very \nsmall (e.g. H+, Ca2+) or very large (e.g. thyroid-stimulating hormone) ligands and everything \nin-between. In addition, these receptors, through G protein-dependent and -independent \nmechanisms, can link to an array of intracellular signalling pathways that can in turn regulate \na plethora of physiological functions. Not surprisingly therefore, GPCRs are almost \nuniversally expressed in cells\/tissues and specific manipulation of their activity is the primary \ntarget of approximately 50% of presently available drugs [10, 11, 12]. It is also becoming \nincreasingly apparent that GPCRs sometimes exhibit cell- and tissue-specific signalling, \nregulatory and\/or pharmacological properties [13]. Genetic variation (single nucleotide \npolymorphisms), post-translational modification (including phosphorylation, glycosylation \nand lipidation) as well as association with accessory proteins may contribute to such \n\u201cphenotypic\u201d diversity [11, 13]. However, much accruing evidence also indicates that \nalternative splicing of GPCRs can profoundly affect signalling, regulatory and\/or \npharmacological properties. In addition, it is worth noting that alternatively spliced GPCR \nisoforms can differ in their abilities to undergo post-translational modification and\/or to \ninteract with accessory proteins. For example, a splice-variant form of the parathyroid \nhormone (PTH)\/PTH-related peptide receptor expressed only in kidney is not post-\ntranslationally glycosylated [14]. \nFor a long time it was assumed that human GPCRs that undergo alternative splicing to form \ndifferent mRNA variants and protein isoforms were rare. In 1999, based on data available \nfrom GeneBank, Gentles and Karlin estimated that more than 90% of human GPCRs are \nintronless [15]. This estimation was based on 120 mammalian GPCRs and 82 primate \nGPCRs. Since then, many more GPCR entries were created. An interrogation of 365 human \nGPCR entries from the IUPHAR database (http:\/\/www.iuphar-\ndb.org\/GPCR\/ReceptorListForward) using the CCDS sequence data available from the NCBI \nweb site (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/CCDS\/CcdsBrowse.cgi) showed that 52% of these \nGPCRs contain at least two exons in their open reading frame (ORF), suggesting the \nexistence of an intron (see Figure 1). All members of family B (secretin and adhesion) and \nfamily C (glutamate) GPCRs have multiple exons; while only 58% of rhodopsin (family A) \n(N.B. olfactory receptors were not included) and 64% of frizzled family GPCRs are \nPage 3 of 35 Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n4 \n \nintronless. Thus, the assumption that more than 90% of human GPCRs are intronless needs to \nbe revised [15]. An important role in postulating the existence of novel splice variants is \nplayed by bioinformatics studies. This approach sets in motion fast identification of novel \nsplice variants as demonstrated for adhesion GPCRs [16].  \nAlthough a large proportion (~50%) of GPCRs are intronless (see Figure 1), those encoded by \nmore than a single exon can potentially undergo alternative mRNA splicing. Almost a decade \nago, Kilpatrick and colleagues [17] and Minneman [18] thoroughly reviewed GPCR splice \nvariants known at the time and their (altered) signalling and functional characteristics; thus in \nthis manuscript we will focus on what has happened subsequently in this area. A list of newly \nidentified GPCR variants\/isoforms is given in Table 1. However, we cannot move forward \nwithout first mentioning two classic examples. The D2 dopamine receptor was one of the first \nGPCRs identified as being expressed in two variant forms generated by alternative splicing \n[36]. The isoforms, termed short (D2S) and long (D2L), differ by 29 amino acids in the third \nintracellular (i3) loop, and this change in amino acid sequence results in isoforms that are \ndifferentially expressed in the CNS and have subtly distinct signalling properties [37]. Thus, \nthe D2L receptor is highly expressed post-synaptically in the regions that receive dopaminergic \ninput, while the D2S receptor isoform is more abundant in regions of the hypothalamus and \nmesencephalon known to synthesize and release dopamine [36, 37]. Another well-established \nexample of a GPCR that is expressed as multiple isoforms is the rat type 1 pituitary adenylate \ncyclase-activating peptide receptor (PAC1 receptor). This receptor has been reported to be \nexpressed in five splice variant forms with the variation existing within the i3 loop (variants \ntermed \u201chip\u201d, \u201chop1\u201d, \u201chop2\u201d, \u201chip-hop1\u201d, and null). In this case, protein isoforms differ with \nrespect to their regulation of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C activities [85]. \nIn general, alternative splicing of GPCRs can lead to the expression of proteins with (see \nFigure 2):  \n(a) Isoforms in which the N-terminus differs due to distinct promoters (e.g. corticotropin-\nreleasing hormone receptor type 2 (CRH-R2), PTH-R), or deletion of exons (e.g. calcitonin \nreceptor (CT-R), corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 (CRH-R1), secretin \nreceptor). In most cases these isoforms have impaired or abolished ligand binding properties. \nPage 4 of 35Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n5 \n \n(b) Isoforms in which the C-terminus varies in length (e.g. prostaglandin EP3 receptor, \nprostaglandin F2\u03b1 receptor, \u03b11A-adrenoceptor, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptor, \nmetabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, \u00b5-opioid receptor, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) \nreceptors, somatostatin receptors, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor type 1, \nneurokinin-1 receptor (NK1)) may have distinct signalling and regulatory \n(desensitization\/internalization) properties. In some cases retention of an intron or deletion of \nan exon can introduce a premature stop-codon, leading to expression of a truncated receptor. \nIn a structural sense these receptors can be missing the original C-terminus, parts of the 7th \ntransmembrane domain (TM7), and even several transmembrane regions.  Some of these \nreceptor variants can exhibit a \u201cdominant-negative\u201d effect, acting to nullify signalling by the \nwild-type receptor (e.g. for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor [86]). A unique \nexample where alternative splicing changes the nature of a receptor is follicle-stimulating \nhormone (FSH) receptor.  A full-length isoform of FSH receptor is a GPCR which couples to \nthe G\u03b1s protein; in contrast, a truncated isoform of FSH receptor (generated by exclusion of \nexons 9 and 10 and use of additional exon 11) belongs to the superfamily of growth factor \nreceptors [41]. \n(c) Isoforms in which an intracellular loop varies in size (e.g. CRH-R1, D2 dopamine, H3 \nhistamine, cholecystokinin-B (CCKB) and PAC1 receptors). Alternative splicing within the i3 \n(and perhaps also i1\/i2) loops can affect G protein coupling preference and\/or coupling can be \naltered or even abolished. \n(d) Isoforms in which TM7 is shortened by 14 amino acids (e.g. CRH-R1, CT-R, PTH-R, \nVPAC2 receptor) can result in poor receptor expression at the plasma membrane and potential \ndominant-negative effects on wild-type receptor function. To date, these isoforms have been \nreported only for secretin (B1 family) GPCRs [27, 69, 87, 88, 89]; however, some members \nof the newly classified family of adhesion GPCRs which have exon-intron organization \nsimilar to the secretin family [90] could potentially give rise to similar splice variants. \n(e) Isoforms with insertions or deletions within the extracellular loops of GPCRs are much \nless common compared to intracellular loop variants and to date only a small number have \nbeen reported (e.g. CT-R, D3 dopamine, orphanin FQ\/nociceptin receptors [17]). In the case \nof the CT-R, an insertion of 37 amino acids within the first extracellular (e1) loop alters \nPage 5 of 35 Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n6 \n \nligand specificity and binding kinetics, while wild-type receptor signal transduction properties \nappear to be preserved [91]. \n(f) Soluble isoforms of GPCRs are severely truncated spliced forms usually composed of only \nall or part of the extracellular N-terminal domain (e.g. luteinizing hormone receptor-LHR \n[54], mGluRs [58], CRH-Rs [92]). In many cases these proteins can bind their ligand, but do \nnot transduce a signal, and thus behave as \u201cdecoy\u201d receptors.  \nAlthough many members of the rhodopsin (family A) and frizzled\/taste2 (frizzled and family \nC) sub-families are expressed as multiple isoforms, all members of the secretin (family B), \nadhesion (family B) and glutamate (family C) sub-families studied to date appear to undergo \nextensive alternative splicing due to their unique exon-intron organization [58, 89, 90]. A \nfascinating example of the importance of splicing in GPCR biology and hormone actions is \nthe CRH-R1 receptor, which orchestrates mammalian responses to stressful stimuli [33]. In \nhumans the CRH-R1 gene spans over 50 kb and contains 14 exons, and at least 14 \nalternatively spliced mRNAs for CRH-R1 variants have been detected to date [33, 34]. The \ncomplete gene product incorporating all 14 exons encodes a 444-amino acid GPCR, termed \nCRH-R1\u03b2, which displays weak agonist binding and impaired signalling properties [93-95]. \nOmission of exon 6 from the mature mRNA results in expression of a 415 amino acid GPCR, \ntermed CRH-R1\u03b1, which encodes the major functional CRH-R1 isoform. Deletion of exon 3 \nresults in CRH-R1c, which lacks 40 amino acids within the N-terminus and no longer binds \nCRH [96]. Various exon deletions or insertions of \u201ccryptic\u201d exons (exons that are absent in \nthe normal form, but occur in an alternative form) result in frame-shifts and the potential \nintroduction of a premature termination codon, leading to the expression of soluble or \nseverely truncated membrane proteins (termed CRH-R1e-h) [34, 97]. Another splice variant, \ntermed CRH-R1d, contains a 42 base-pair exon deletion resulting in a 14 amino acid deletion \nfrom TM7 [87]. It is interesting to note that at least 3 other members of the secretin family of \nGPCRs (CT-R, PTH-R and VPAC2 receptor) can undergo similar splicing to produce \nisoforms with shortened TM7 domains [27, 69, 88, 89]; and in each case this sequence \nmodification causes signalling impairment, at least partly due to endoplasmic reticulum \nretention and poor plasma membrane expression of the spliced isoform [27, 98, 99]. At \npresent, the biological relevance of expression of these different splice variants is unknown; \nPage 6 of 35Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n7 \n \nhowever, a recent study had suggested that over-expression of CRH-R1d might lead to \nimpairment of type 2 CRH-R signalling [98, 100], and similar results have been obtained for \nthe calcitonin receptor variant, CTR\u220613 [27, 99] and the VPAC2 receptor variant, SD-VPAC2 \n[101].  \nMechanisms of Alternative Splicing of GPCRs \nAlthough what governs GPCR alternative splicing remains largely unknown, there are a \nnumber of indications that changing (patho)physiological conditions can influence the way in \nwhich GPCR pre-mRNAs are processed. Thus, it has been reported that activation of protein \nkinases (PKA and PKC) and environmental insults (UV irradiation) can lead to modulation of \nCRH-R1 mRNA expression in keratinocytes and melanoma cells [34]. In addition, \nphysiological changes, such as the onset of labour, can alter the relative expression of CRH-\nR1 variants in the uterus [102]. An increasing body of evidence points towards steroid \nhormones as potential modulators of alternative splicing. Oestrogen can bring about the up-\nregulation of important regulators for splicing, such as SR-protein (SC35) and hnRNPA1 \n[103] and can regulate transcription and mRNA splicing directly though CAPER molecules \n[104]. Oestrogen and other steroid hormones can also affect the ratio of D2S and D2L \ndopamine receptor variants in various target cells both in vitro and in vivo, without affecting \ntotal receptor mRNA expression, suggesting that steroid sex hormones exert their effects, at \nleast in part, at the level of alternative splicing [105, 106]. In addition, in myometrial smooth \nmuscle, progesterone treatment can regulate the ratio of CRH-R1\u03b1\/\u03b2 mRNA expression [33].  \nDuring normal development the expression profile of some of GPCR splice variants changes. \nA study published recently by Bovolin et al. [57] showed that mice embryonic mitral cells \nexpress mainly the mGlu1b receptor variant, but by one week of age, this splice variant has \nbecome a minor component and mRNA for the mGlu1a receptor variant predominates. The \nauthors speculate that the two splice variants, which have different trafficking properties and \nsub-cellular localizations [56], might encode proteins that have distinct roles in embryonic \nmitral cell maturation (mGlu1b receptor) and post partum in synaptic refinement (mGlu1a \nreceptor) [57]. The differential expression patterns of the wild-type gonadotropin-releasing \nhormone receptor and its splice variant forms in neonatal and adult tissues also suggest that \ndifferent isoforms of this receptor are involved in early development of ovary and testis [107]. \nPage 7 of 35 Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n8 \n \nIn many cancers, proteins involved in regulation of alternative splicing are down-regulated \nresulting in expression of differently spliced GPCR isoforms; such is a case with CCK-B and \nsecretin receptors in gastrointestinal, colonic and pancreatic cancers [31, 76].  \nAll of the examples of GPCR isoforms described so far are products of cis-splicing, that is, a \nsingle molecule of pre-mRNA is processed to generate mRNA. However, trans-splicing, \nalternative splicing of the 5\u2019-untranslated region (5\u2019-UTR) and single nucleotide \npolymorphisms (SNP) have been also identified as important mechanisms in alternative \nsplicing of GPCRs. \nTrans-splicing: Numerous members of the adhesion GPCR sub-family are subject to undergo \nalternative splicing to generate functionally unique isoforms [16, 108]. Although, in mammals \nthe process of trans-splicing (occurring between two separate mRNAs [109]), is rare \ncompared to cis-splicing, adhesion GPCRs undergo this type of event. The epidermal growth \nfactor-seven transmembrane spanning (EGF-TM7) receptors, which are mostly restricted to \nleukocytes, undergo extensive cis- and trans-splicing in order to expand the range of \nfunctional adhesion GPCRs [40], including diversification of ligand repertoire and cellular \nfunctions. \n5\u2019-UTR alternative splicing: Even in the case of GPCRs that have only one intron, or are \nintronless in the ORF, alternative splicing of the 5\u2019-UTR could play a crucial role in their \npost-transcriptional regulation, including the modulation of translational efficiency, message \nstability and subcellular localization. For example, Kreth and co-workers [22] have reported \nthat alternative splicing of the 5\u2019-UTR of the A2A adenosine receptor gene can alter receptor \nprotein expression, and this could be of potential importance in how these receptors \ncontribute to the physiological response to sepsis. It is established that adenosine, via \nactivation of A2A adenosine receptor, reduces phagocytosis, increases secretion of anti-\ninflammatory cytokines and induces lymphocyte apoptosis [110]. Thus, the reduced \nexpression of the receptor might be beneficial in the treatment of infection and sepsis [110]. \nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): SNPs, as providers of molecular diversity, are \nresponsible for approximately 90% of human DNA variation. The SNPs in the coding regions \nof genes can be synonymous (silent) or non-synonymous, with the latter causing an amino \nacid change leading to potential phenotypic variation [111]. However, SNPs in the non-\nPage 8 of 35Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n9 \n \ncoding regions of genes can have an effect on gene expression and splicing. Recently, it has \nbeen reported that several SNPs within the D2 dopamine receptor gene can affect the receptor \nvariant expression profile [112]. One of these SNPs is an upstream promoter polymorphism \nand two intronic SNPs are able to affect D2 receptor splicing, by generating a novel \ntranscription factor binding site and new cis-acting sites to which splicing factors (e.g. SC35 \nand SRp40) could bind [112]. A physiological consequence of these SNPs is that the \ngenetically-driven changes in D2 dopamine receptor splicing appear to affect behaviour and \nworking memory in humans [112].  \nAberrant Transcription versus Physiologically-Relevant Processing \nThe majority of GPCR splice variants have initially been identified at the mRNA level and \nthe physiological relevance of alternative mRNA splicing to generate GPCR isoforms might \nbe questioned or even dismissed as the result of aberrant or \u201cleaky\u201d transcription. A general \nlack of isoform-specific antibodies has often made it very difficult to demonstrate that mRNA \nvariants are translated into mature proteins in endogenous systems. However, in recent years \nincreasing numbers of reports suggest potential physiological consequences of GPCR \nalternative splicing. For example, it has been established that alternatively spliced GPCRs can \nhave distinct (and perhaps physiologically desirable), signalling characteristics (e.g. PAC1 \nreceptor [85, 113], mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors [114-116], NK1 receptor [63]), impaired \nsignalling properties and\/or dominant-negative effects on wild-type receptors (as described \nabove for CT-R and CRH-R1), and constitutive activity (e.g. mGlu1, prostaglandin EP3, and \n5HT4 receptors (reviewed in [18])). Perhaps more importantly, hormone responsiveness can \nbe fine-tuned by regulating the relative expression of GPCR isoforms (e.g. angiotensin II type \n1 (AT1) [24, 25] and CRH [102] receptors). A recent study by Einstein and co-workers [21] \nhas shown that the GPCR complement within human airway smooth muscle undergoes \nfrequent alternative splicing, resulting in unexpected receptor isoforms which might be of \npotential significance in the development of future drugs for respiratory diseases.  \nAlternative Splicing of GPCRs in Cancer \nA large number of molecular changes, including genetic instability, insufficient DNA \nmismatch repair, increased oncogene expression and defects in several splicing mechanisms \nPage 9 of 35 Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n10 \n \nhave been described in cancer cells relative to their healthy counterparts [7, 117]. \nAlternatively spliced mRNAs of many GPCRs have been detected in various cancers. \nHowever, whether this is simply a consequence of cancer cell biology, or the cancer-\nassociated GPCR isoforms have an effect on cancer growth and metastasis is poorly \nunderstood. Nevertheless, the role of GPCRs and their ligands in cancer progression has been \nquite widely investigated.  \nProliferation of tumour cells is promoted by neuropeptides and growth factors, which are \neither synthesized locally by the cancerous cells or derived from the systemic circulation. One \nsuch peptide is growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Many cancers, including \novarian, endometrial, prostate, small cell lung carcinoma and various sarcoma cell-lines have \nthe ability to produce GHRH, which might serve as an autocrine growth factor for these \ncancers [44, 118]. Until recently [44], full-length GHRH-receptor (pGHRH-R), which is \nabundant in the anterior pituitary gland, was not detected in many GHRH-responsive cancers \nand human cancer cell-lines; instead four alternatively spliced, truncated mRNAs for GHRH-\nR have been detected [45, 46]. Among these truncated isoforms of the GHRH receptor, SV1, \nwhich is primarily detected in a majority of GHRH-responsive tumours, shows the greatest \nsimilarity to full-length, pGHRH-R. This isoform differs only in the first 3 exons, encoding a \npart of the extracellular domain of the receptor. In the SV1 isoform this region is replaced by \na fragment of intron 3, which has a new putative in-frame start codon [46]. It has been \ndemonstrated that when expressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, that do not possess either \npGHRH-R or SV1, SV1 is more potent than pGHRH-R in inducing ligand-dependent cell \nproliferation [47]. Additionally, MCF-7 cells transfected with SV1 proliferate more quickly \nthan non-transfected counterparts, even in the absence of GHRH, suggesting the existence of \nligand independent SV1 activity [47]. Moreover, in vitro studies utilizing human oestrogen-\nindependent breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-435), as well as mouse \nmammary carcinomas, showed that GHRH antagonists can directly inhibit cell proliferation \n[119, 120]. Thus, an antagonist of GHRH-R might be effective in the treatment of some \noestrogen-independent cancers, and it might be desirable to selectively target the SV1 \nisoform, potentially sparing normal GHRH-R function [48, 49, 121]. In 2005, Havt and co-\nworkers employed a sensitive real-time PCR technique, combined with Western blotting and \na receptor ligand-binding assay to show that malignant and non-malignant human tissues \nPage 10 of 35Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n11 \n \nexpress the full-length pGHRH-R and its splice variants [44]. These findings demonstrated \nfor the first time the co-existence of pGHRH-R and its splice variants in human tumours, but \nfurther studies are needed to dissect any (patho)physiological significance of this co-\nexpression.  \nThromboxane synthesis has been reported to be elevated in bladder cancers and inhibition of \nthe synthesis or action of these prostanoid mediators can decrease rates of cell proliferation \nand migration [122]. In the late 1990s it was demonstrated that two isoforms of the \nthromboxane receptor (TP-\u03b1 and TP-\u03b2), alternatively spliced at the C-terminus, have distinct \nagonist-induced internalization properties and abilities to bind \u03b2-arrestins [80], with only the \nTP-\u03b2 isoform able to internalize in a ligand-dependent manner. Thromboxane receptor \nsplicing could, as a consequence of each variant giving rise to distinct cellular responses, \ndifferentially affect key processes, such as mitogenesis. In this context it is interesting to note \nthat the TP-\u03b2 isoform has been shown to be over-expressed in some patients with bladder \ncancer and this expression is associated with a poorer prognosis. Moreover, this isoform alone \nis able to transform SV-HUC (immortalized human uroepithelial cells) into highly \nproliferative and motile cells and is highly expressed in various cancer-derived cell-lines, \nincluding prostate, breast, colon and renal cell carcinoma [81], suggesting an important role \nof this isoform in determining the progression of the disease.  \nAnother group of GPCRs that has been heavily implicated in cancer pathophysiology are the \ngastrointestinal peptide hormone receptors, including the gastrin\/cholecystokinin-B (CCK-B) \n[31], secretin receptors [76, 77] and somatostatin [78]. An alternatively spliced isoform of the \nCCK-B receptor that retains the fourth intron might play an important role in the development \nand progression of colon and pancreatic carcinoma [8, 31]. Thus, it has been demonstrated \nthat in a pancreatic carcinoma cell-line (MIA PaCa-2) the low expression of U2AF35 (a small \nunit of the U2AF complex, that specifically recognizes the 3\u2019-end dinucleotide AG which \nserves as an important splicing signal for pre-mRNA processing) is responsible for the \nretention and incorporation of the fourth intron into the mature CCK-B receptor protein [31], \nand this isoform plays a role in stimulating tumour growth [8].  \nPage 11 of 35 Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n12 \n \nDetecting the expression and understanding the significance of the various GPCR isoforms \nup-regulated in cancer could be of pivotal importance for future in vivo targeting of tumours \nboth diagnostically and therapeutically. \nAlternative Splicing of GPCRs in Reproduction \nMuch effort has been made to identify genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in \npregnancy, and especially in pathophysiological conditions, such as pre-term labour and pre-\neclampsia. Here too, alternative pre-mRNA splicing has been shown to play a major role in \nsmooth muscle myogenesis and contractility. The role of myometrial processes in regulating \nthe activity of the uterus during gestation and parturition are linked to the differential \nexpression and function of specific genes including: cyclooxygenase-2, oxytocin receptors, \nprogesterone receptors, specific prostaglandin receptor subtypes, CRHR1, and G\u03b1s protein \n[123]. Most of these, and many other proteins, are expressed as distinct isoforms generated \nfrom alternate pre-mRNA splicing. These isoforms have a potentially dominant role in the \nnormal progression of pregnancy. \nCRH and CRH-related peptides are expressed in placental and intrauterine tissues during \npregnancy and labour. However, the precise biological function of CRH during human \npregnancy is still an enigma [124].  There is a wealth of evidence, including myometrial \ncontractility studies, suggesting that CRH plays a \u201cprotective\u201d role for the pregnant uterus, by \nregulating intracellular signalling pathways that can maintain the uterus in a state of \nrelaxation and prevent contraction [124]. On the other hand, increased maternal plasma CRH \nlevels are a predictor of the onset of labour [125]. It is evident that human pregnancy is linked \nwith changes in CRH-R isoformic expression in reproductive tissues [102, 126]. Two CRH-\nR1 mRNA variants, R1\u03b1 and R1c, have been identified in syncytiotrophoblasts (the outermost \nsyncytial layer of the foetal component of the placenta) and amniotic epithelial cells [127]. \nAdditionally, the presence of CRHR1d mRNA has been found in foetal membranes (chorion \nand amnion tissues) [87]. Seven mRNA splice variants (R1\u03b1, R1\u03b2, R1c, R1d, R2\u03b1, R2\u03b2 and \nR2\u03b3) of the CRH receptors have also been reported in the human pregnant myometrium \nimmediately prior to onset of labour, whereas only three isoforms (R1\u03b1, R1\u03b2 and R2\u03b2) are \nroutinely detected in the non-pregnant myometrium [87, 128]. These findings suggest that \nCRH, acting via different receptor variants, may be able to exert distinct actions on the human \nPage 12 of 35Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n13 \n \nmyometrium in pregnant versus non-pregnant states [129]. More recent evidence indicates \nthat as pregnancy progresses towards labour (either term or pre-term) transcription of the \nCRH-R1 gene, and its alternative splicing, is increased [102]. The precise mechanism \nunderlying this event is unknown, but in vitro studies of myometrial cells originating from \npregnant subjects identified interleukin-1\u03b2 as a potential regulator of CRH-R1 gene \ntranscription and splicing [102]. However, due to a lack of CRH-R isoform-specific \nantibodies it has not been possible to establish which of these alternatively spliced mRNAs \nare translated to mature proteins. Therefore, the physiological importance of these alternative \nsplicing events is presently unclear. However, it is tempting to speculate that the expression \nof various CRH-R isoforms might allow activation of alternative signalling cascades (or \ndampen wild-type receptor activity), facilitating the transition from relaxed to contractile \nuterine states [102, 129]. \nAnother hormone involved in reproductive physiology is relaxin, which binds to the relaxin \nfamily peptide receptors (RXFP1 and RXFP2) [130]. Several splice variants of RXFP1 \n(formerly known as LGR7 (leucine-rich-repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 7)) \nhave been identified.  Some of them produce a soluble, truncated and secreted protein which \nbinds to relaxin and antagonizes its actions in vivo [73]. Several splice variants, cloned from \nhuman foetal membranes [74, 75], human uterus and brain [130], encode RXFP1 isoforms \nwith different lengths of the extracellular domain. These N-terminally truncated isoforms can \nexert dominant-negative effects on the wild-type receptor, which could be of potential \nfunctional significance in dampening the responsiveness of reproductive tissues to relaxin, \nespecially since animal studies have indicated that these truncated RXFP1 isoforms are \nprevalent in pregnancy [75].  \nLuteinizing hormone (LH) and its receptor (LHR) play a pivotal role in female and male \ngonadal function, pregnancy and foetal sex differentiation. Mutations that lead to loss-of-\nfunction in the male are linked with severe phenotypes, such as female external genitalia, \nmicropenis and oligospermia; while in women primary and secondary sexual characteristics \ndevelop normally, but infertility is common [131, 132]. Bruysters and colleagues have \nrecently described a family that carries a homozygous mutation G\u2192A at position -1 at the \nintron 10\/exon 11 boundary of the LHR gene, resulting in alternative splicing of LHR and an \nPage 13 of 35 Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n14 \n \neight amino acid deletion [53]. In vitro studies have shown that receptor expression is not \naffected, but the potency of LH (but not human chorionic gonadotropin) is reduced; thus, this \nLHR isoform shows impaired hormone responsiveness [53]. A male patient and his three \nsisters showed reproductive impairment. The male patient had delayed puberty, micropenis \nand oligospermia; while two of his sisters were infertile and the third sister had three \nspontaneous miscarriages [53]. Another splice variant of LHR that results in a frame-shift in \nthe reading frame and creates a truncated receptor composed of the N-terminal ectodomain \n(responsible for high-affinity ligand binding), causes an alteration in pituitary-gonadal \nfunction, and morphological changes in the adrenals and kidneys of transgenic mice [54]. \nThis variant also appears to control the cell surface expression of the wild-type receptor by \nmisrouting newly synthesized receptors in the ER [54]. \nAlternative Splicing of GPCR in Other Pathophysiological Conditions \nObesity - Insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells is potentiated by binding of \u201cincretin\u201d \npeptides, including gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), to their receptors. The 460 amino \nacid wild-type GIP receptor, a GPCR of the secretin family, is expressed in mouse \u03b2-cells \nalong with a GIP receptor splice variant that retains intron 8, which introduces a premature \nstop-codon resulting in a truncated C-terminus [43]. GIP activation of this latter isoform does \nnot lead to production of cyclic AMP, and inhibits the ability of the wild-type receptor to \nactivate this pathway on agonist addition. This is achieved though interactions between \ntruncated and wild-type GIP receptors in the ER, which reduce trafficking of the wild-type \nGIP receptor from the ER to the cell-surface [43]. Mice fed a high-fat diet exhibit a relative \nreduction in the expression of the truncated isoform, suggesting that loss of this isoform might \nbe involved in the hypersensitivity to GIP and hyperinsulinaemia evident in this diet-induced \nmodel of obesity [43]. \nImmuno-modulation - The neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor, which binds substance P, an \nimportant neuropeptide involved in pain perception and the modulation of both inflammatory \nand immune responses, occurs as two variants: a full length 407 amino acid receptor, and a \ntruncated, 311 amino acid isoform [60-62, 133]. These isoforms have distinct signalling \nproperties, with only the wild-type receptor being able to increase intracellular Ca2+ \nconcentration and activate the transcription factor NF\u03baB, leading to increased expression of \nPage 14 of 35Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n15 \n \nmRNA for interleukin-8 [59]. In addition, compared to the wild-type receptor, the truncated \nNK1 receptor variant may have an increased ability to interact with different G proteins, other \nGPCRs, or G protein-independent signalling pathways [59, 63]. This could be of considerable \nimportance in cells and tissues that have distinct expressions of the NK1 receptor isoforms. \nFor example, in undifferentiated THP-1 cells (a human monocytic cell-line), only the \ntruncated NK1 receptor isoform is expressed. However, differentiation of these cells towards a \nmacrophage phenotype with a phorbol ester leads to the expression of both isoforms [64], \nwhich could modulate cellular activity. Different brain regions appear to exhibit different \npatterns of NK1 receptor pre-mRNA alternative splicing, with expression of the truncated \nNK1 receptor often being greater than that of the full-length variant [64], which could result in \neffects on pain perception.  \nHistamine receptor-associated pathophysiological states - Drugs that target different \nhistamine receptors have been widely used to treat various conditions, including allergies, \ngastric-related disorders and migraine. In contrast to the H1 and H2 histamine receptor genes, \nthe genes encoding H3 and H4 histamine receptors include several intronic sequences. This \ncan result in expression of alternatively spliced isoforms and several H3 histamine receptor \nspliced variants have been described (see [50] for review). For example, novel isoforms \nlacking TM7 and containing an alternate C-terminus (6TM-H3 isoforms) have been isolated \nand characterized from rat brain [51]. When recombinantly expressed, these isoforms are \nretained within intracellular compartments, and thus they are unlikely to bind ligand or couple \nto signalling pathways [51]. However, co-expression studies have demonstrated that 6TM-H3 \ncan selectively interfere with the membrane expression of the wild-type H3 receptor and affect \nits ability to signal normally; thus, 6TM-H3 acts as a dominant-negative isoform. It is \ntherefore again tempting to speculate that functional (and constitutive) activity of the H3 \nreceptor can be \u201cfine-tuned\u201d through expression of both 6TM-H3 and wild-type, 7TM \nisoforms in a given system [51].  \nRecently, van Rijn and co-workers have identified two novel, alternatively spliced H4 \nhistamine receptor isoforms from CD34+ cord blood-cell-derived eosinophils and mast cells \n[52]. One splice variant encoded a 302 amino acid protein that contained a deletion of 88 \namino acids between predicted TM2 and TM4 domains; while a second splice variant \nPage 15 of 35 Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n16 \n \nencoded only the first 67 amino acids of the whole receptor. Both of the receptor variants, \nwhen over-expressed in HEK293 cells, had primarily an intracellular localization and failed to \nbind ligand. However, when co-expressed with the wild-type H4 histamine receptor, both \nisoforms had a dominant-negative effect via hetero-oligomerization [52]. Again, more \nresearch is needed to assess whether splice variations in H4 receptor expression are relevant to \nany pathophysiological aspects associated with the normal functioning of this receptor \nsubtype in vivo. \nRespiratory diseases - Susceptibility to asthma and related respiratory diseases has in many \ncases a genetic component. A genome-wide scan suggested that one of the contributory \nfactors to asthma and other IgE-mediated diseases could be GPRA (also known as GPR154 \nand the neuropeptide S receptor) [134]. Several splice variants of the receptor have been \ndescribed [67]. Two splice variants that encode GPRA isoforms with distinct C-termini \n(termed A and B isoforms) are full-length isoforms that traffic to the plasma membrane. \nInterestingly, another isoform, the short one that is expressed in intracellular compartments \ndoes not affect the cell surface expression of the full-length receptors when co-expressed [67]. \nImmunohistochemical studies showed that the A isoform is primarily expressed in smooth \nmuscle cells, while the B isoform is principally detected in epithelial cells. When these \nauthors compared airway smooth muscle (ASM) of asthmatic and healthy individuals they \nfound that the B isoform was more strongly expressed in samples from asthmatic patients \n[134], suggesting that the neuropeptide S receptor could be a strong candidate for \ninvolvement in the pathophysiology of asthma and respiratory atopy in Caucasian \npopulations. However, pharmacological studies did not find any substantial differences in the \nbinding and signalling properties of the two GPRA isoforms [135]. Further work on knockout \nGPRA-\/- mouse model failed to detect differences in the development of allergic lung disease \nin these animals, despite the demonstrable loss of functional GPRA [136]. Additionally, \nstudies conducted in a Mexican population showed that in contrast to Caucasian and Asian \npopulations, GPRA variants do not appear to be important contributors to childhood asthma \nsusceptibility in Mexicans [137].  \nWork by Einstein and co-workers [21] highlighted the complexity of GPCR expression and \nalternative splicing in human airway smooth muscle (ASM). The authors hypothesized that \nPage 16 of 35Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n17 \n \nsometimes complex and contradictory pharmacological responses of ASM GPCRs might be \ndue to variable GPCR expression and the frequent alternative splicing of the receptors leading \nto a \u201chighly diversified receptor milieu\u201d. This study highlighted the fact that potentially 353 \ndifferent GPCRs are expressed in airways smooth muscle, of which 192 GPCRs have on \naverage five alternatively spliced variants. One GPCR expressed in multiple splice variants is \nthe leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor, a receptor known to contribute to abnormal \nresponsiveness in lung disease [21]. High-affinity LTB4 receptors, expressed on neutrophils, \neosinophils and T-lymphocytes, on activation by its endogenous agonists facilitate leukocyte \nmigration to the lung [138]. Moreover, expression of the LTB4 receptor in ASM could \ncontribute to bronchoconstriction, due to coupling of the receptor to Gq and Gi proteins [139]. \nThe work from Einstein and co-workers [21] raises a possibility that discrepant \nbronchoconstrictive effects of LTB4 receptor antagonists might be due to the presence of \ndifferent receptor isoforms in ASM. \nNeuronal function \u2013 The mammalian CNS shows the greatest diversity of GPCR expression \nof any organ in the body. Neuronal GPCRs are presently targeted directly (GPCR agonists \nand antagonists) or indirectly (through the us  of drugs that alter endogenous neurotransmitter \nlevels) to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. As already stated, an array \nof important neurotransmitter\/neuromodulator GPCRs are expressed in a number of \nalternatively spliced variant isoforms, including dopamine, opioid, 5HT4 and 5HT7, V2 \nvasopressin, metabotropic glutamate (mGlu), and GABAB receptors [17, 19, 20, 68, 83, 140, \n141]. Although some of the better characterized GPCR splice variants (e.g. D2S and D2L \ndopamine receptors) exhibit only quite subtle differences in their signalling properties, data \nare beginning to appear that at least hint at how such splice variation might affect GPCR \nfunction both physiologically and pathophysiologically.  \nFor example, C-terminal \u00b5-opioid receptor variants differ in their ability to be recycled to the \nplasma membrane (\u201cresensitized\u201d) following agonist-induced internalization [142]. As \ndescribed above, mGlu1 receptor isoforms (a and b) are differentially expressed during \nneuronal development and differentiation, and the mGlu1a and 1b isoforms appear to have \ndistinct cellular localizations and constitutive activities, as well as exhibiting potency and\/or \nefficacy differences with respect to agonists [56, 57, 140]. Similarly, alternative splicing of \nPage 17 of 35 Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n18 \n \nthe D3 dopamine receptor can produce seven variants, including a non-dopamine binding \nD3nf isoform [38, 143]. Quaternary interaction of D3nf with full-length D3 (or D1) dopamine \nreceptors to form dimers can reduce trafficking of the dopamine-binding isoform to the \nplasma membrane [143]. Altered splicing efficiency with respect to the D3 dopamine receptor \nand the consequent alteration in the proportion of full-length and truncated forms generated in \nneuronal populations has been hypothesized to be linked to schizophrenia [18, 38, 143]. \nClosing Remarks \nIn this short review we have not sought to cover all GPCRs that are expressed from \nalternative splicing of pre-mRNAs, but we have attempted to provide an overview of GPCR \nalternative splicing with an emphasis on newly emerging aspects. In Table 1 we provide an \nadditional summary of some recent findings not mentioned above (and see [17, 18] for the \ndevelopments before 2001). Additionally, we have aimed to show that many more GPCRs \nthan was initially thought (or perhaps has become a widely accepted misconception), possess \nintrons (Figure 1). This does not mean that all multi-exon-containing GPCRs will undergo \nalternative pre-mRNA splicing. For GPCRs that are encoded by only two exons (e.g. some \nmembers of the rhodopsin and frizzled families), it is very likely that alternatively spliced \nmRNA would be subject to nonsense-mediated decay, and the message is never translated \ninto a protein product.  \nThe interest in alternative splicing of GPCRs is increasing, and novel variants are being \nidentified on a regular basis. In 2005, two companies launched GPCR SpliceArray\u2122 for the \nidentification of alternatively spliced GPCR mRNAs (http:\/\/www.exonhit.com). Other \nmanufacturers, including Affimetrix and Jivan Company, also provide GPCR arrays. The \narrays can be custom-made in order to investigate particular (sometimes rare) splicing events \nwithin a sub-group of GPCRs, but also broader arrays can be designed to study the usage of \nalternative splice donor\/acceptor sites, insertion of novel exons, exon skipping, intron \nretention, or a partial internal exon deletion in a broad number of GPCRs. This new high-\nthroughput approach based on microarray technology uses several probes (usually six) that \nare specific for an exon and span over the exon junctions allowing robust and specific \ndetection of the two possible mRNAs resulting from each splicing event. The data obtained \nfrom these arrays have to be validated using traditional experimental methods (usually RT-\nPage 18 of 35Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nCMLS-2009-0411 \n19 \n \nPCR and western blotting) which confirm the presence of particular alternatively spliced \nmRNAs and protein isoforms. Bioinformatics studies that predict the existence of mRNA \nvariants and analyse whether potentially transcribed protein isoforms would be functional are \nof great importance in this task [16]. \nMore often than not, isoforms of a particular GPCR have distinct pharmacological and \nsignalling properties. In order to start understanding the link between these diverse \npharmacological and signalling characteristics on one side and physiological consequences of \nthe activation of various GPCR isoforms on the other side, comprehensive studies that dissect \nthe regulatory mechanisms at the molecular level of GPCRs alternative mRNA splicing are \ncrucial. These studies could be of pivotal importance in understanding and treating \npathophysiological conditions that might favour expression of isoforms with altered \nsignalling.  \nInterestingly, signalling cascades, including the Ras\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and \nCa2+\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase pathways, which are often activated as a \nconsequence of ligand binding to various GPCRs, have been implicated in regulation of \nalternative splicing of CD44, a cell-surface receptor that is also involved in cell adhesion and \nmigration [144] and the large conductance, voltage- and Ca2+-activated (SLO) K+ channel \npre-mRNA splicing [145]. Moreover, signalling via D1 dopamine receptors activates a \npathway that results in the phosphorylation of key transcriptional and splicing factors, \nincluding Ania-6 (human homologue = cyclin-L), RNA polymerase II, SC35 and CDKp110 \n[146], and could potentially regulate the alternative splicing of an array of proteins. It is well \nestablished that the majority of GPCRs are desensitized, internalized and down-regulated by \nconstant or repeated exposure to agonist. Is it possible that expression of spliced isoforms \nallows fine-tuning of this process? Is it possible that activation of a GPCR \u201cauto-regulates\u201d \nexpression of its own spliced isoforms, or regulates the expression of other GPCR isoforms? \nThese and many other questions remain to be answered. \nAcknowledgments \nWe would like to thank Drs.

In the \u201cpre-human \ngenome era\u201d it was assumed that more than 90% of human GPCRs were intronless [15]. \nHowever, analysis from various databases and bioinformatic studies indicate that the number \nof intron-containing GPCRs has been under-estimated. Using a list of over 350 GPCRs from \nthe IUPHAR database and examining their ORF sequences for the presence of alternate exons \n(using CCDS data from NCBI), it is obvious that a large number of GPCRs contain more than \none exon (52%).  This does not mean that all of them can be expressed as alternatively spliced \nvariants (mRNA) or isoforms (proteins), but that they are not intronless. These data are also \nlikely to be an under-estimate, because if the CCDS data are not available for a gene, we \nwould assign the GPCR as intronless.  \n \nFigure 2 Schematic representation of GPCR structure summarizing potential splice \nvariants. The 7TM domains are shown as blue cylinders; the N-terminus is facing the \nextracellular side of the plasma membrane, while the C-terminus is intracellular. The events \nthat lead to translation of alternatively spliced isoforms are outlined in the boxes. \n \nPage 33 of 35 Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nFamily A (284 members): \n119 members have 2 or \nmore exons in ORF (42%)\nFamily B (47 members): \n47 members have 2 or more \nexons in ORF (100%)\nFamily C (23 members): \n23 members have 2 or more \nexons in ORF (100%)\nFrizzled family (11 members): \n4 members have 2 or more \nexons in ORF (36%)\n52% of 365 GPCR entries \nfrom IUPHAR database \ncontain at least 2 exons\nFIGURE 1 (Markovic & Challiss)\nPage 34 of 35Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\nFIGURE 2 (Markovic & Challiss)\nAmino acid deletion,\nshort TM7\nImpaired membrane \nexpression\/ dominant-\nnegative effect.\nNH\n2\nCOOH\nVariable intracellular loops\nAltered G protein coupling and\/or \nprotein-protein interactions.\nTM5\nPremature STOP codon\nAltered protein structure. \nDominant-negative effects?\nSoluble protein.\nVariable extracellular loops\nAltered ligand binding.\nTruncated\/variable N-terminus \nAltered ligand binding.
