Introduction\nMuch of the northwestern European continental mar-\ngin underwent significant tectonic deformation and\ndenudation during Cenozoic time (e.g. Bulat & Stoker,\n1987; O\u2019Driscoll et al. 1995; Vogt, 1995; Japsen, 1997;\nJapsen, Boldreel & Chalmers, 1998; Dore\u00b4 et al. 1999).\nEvidence for this includes thermochronological data\n(Rohrman et al. 1995; Rohrman & van der Beek, 1996;\nGreen, Duddy & Bray, 1997; Rowley & White, 1998;\nGreen et al. 1999), structural relationships in onshore\nand offshore basins (e.g. Shannon, 1991; Naylor, 1992;\nTate, 1993; Brodie & White, 1995), and coarse clastic\nsedimentation (Stoker, 1997; Stoker, van Weering\n& Svaerdborg, 2001). Most of the direct onshore\nevidence for Cenozoic tectonic deformation in Ireland\nis based on the displacement of Upper Cretaceous\nchalk, Paleocene basalt flows and Oligocene sequences\nin the northeast of the country (Parnell, Shukla &\n\u2020Author for correspondence: mcunningham@rocketmail.com\nMeighan, 1988; Naylor, 1992; Geoffroy, Bergerat &\nAngelier, 1996). However, little is known about the\nCenozoic tectonic history outside this region due to an\nabsence of stratigraphic resolution (e.g. Naylor, 1992;\nAllen et al. 2002).\nThe aim of this paper is to elucidate the Cenozoic,\ndenudational and tectonic history of the Wicklow and\nBlackstairs Mountains and Tullow Lowland of south-\neastern Ireland. We use a subset of an existing\napatite fission-track dataset to define discrete structural\ndomains by comparing apatite fission-track central age\nwith elevation, and we evaluate the spatial and temporal\npersistence of these domains using a numerical inverse\nthermal history model coupled to well-established geo-\nlogical constraints. We then examine geomorphic indi-\ncators of tectonic activity along structures with inferred\nor suspected Cenozoic differential displacements.\nFinally, we relate our findings to observations of known\nCenozoic deformation from northeastern Ireland and\nother parts of the northwestern European continental\nmargin.\n102 M. J. M. CUNNINGHAM AND OTHERS\n2. Regional setting\nThe Wicklow and Blackstairs Mountains and Tullow\nLowland are largely underlain by the 404 \u00b1 24 Ma\nLeinster Granite batholith (O\u2019Connor & Bru\u00a8ck, 1978),\nforming the largest contiguous area of high topography\non the island (Fig. 1). The Wicklow Mountains form\na broad, gently rolling upland, and the Blackstairs\nMountains represent the southeastern continuation of\nthis upland, forming a series of elongate, NE-trending\nridges, with elevations rising to 800 m above sea level\n(asl), separated by low-lying passes. To the south and\nwest of the Wicklow Mountains and to the north of the\nBlackstairs Mountains is the Tullow Lowland, a broad\nlow-relief plain at elevations of 100 to 130 m asl with\nthin limestone to granite dominated tills (from east to\nwest respectively) interspersed with sporadic granite\noutcrop (Fig. 1a).\nThe batholith is bounded to the east and west\nby Cambrian to Lower Ordovician metasediments,\nforming the Leinster Massif terrain (Max, Barber &\nMartinez, 1990), which is in fault contact with Car-\nboniferous limestone of the Dublin Basin to the north\n(Fig. 1b).\nIn the southwest, Upper Devonian and Lower Car-\nboniferous rocks rest unconformably on the batholith\n(Fig. 1b).\n2.a. Models of topographic development\nin southeastern Ireland\nThe nature and timing of processes that shaped\nthe present-day topography of the Wicklow and\nBlackstairs Mountains are poorly understood. Granitic\nclasts derived from the batholith, occur in the Upper\nDevonian Old Red Sandstone of Counties Kilkenny\nand Waterford (Jukes, 1862; Capewell, 1956), and\nfeldspars from the batholith occur in Upper Devonian\nsiliciclastics of the eastern Munster basin (Penney,\n1980). In County Kilkenny, Upper Devonian Old\nRed Sandstone onlaps schist to rest on the batholith.\nTherefore the southern part of the batholith was at\nleast partially unroofed at this time. Similarly, in\nthe Courceyan Dublin Basin to the north, granitic\nfragments occur in Vise\u00b4an limestones up to distances of\n5 km from the margins of the batholith (Montgomery,\n1864\u201367; Ball, 1888) indicating that the northern part\nof the Leinster Granite batholith was partially exposed\nduring Carboniferous times.\nA number of workers have thus suggested that the\nWicklow and Blackstairs Mountains have formed pos-\nitive topography that underwent continuous denudation\nfrom the Middle Palaeozoic onward (Wills, 1951;\nFreeman, 1960). Others have argued that the Leinster\nGranite batholith was protected by a younger sedi-\nmentary cover, subsequently removed during Cenozoic\ntime to expose granite, schist septa and roof pendants\n(Jukes, 1862; Cole, 1922; Cole & Hallissy, 1914;\nCharlesworth, 1963). In support of this theory, these\nworkers noted the discordance of the present-day river\nsystems with respect to structure. The major rivers\nthat drain southeastern Ireland, particularly the rivers\nSlaney and Barrow (Fig. 1), were inferred to have\nonce flowed to the south or southeast over a low-relief\nsedimentary cover. As erosion stripped away the cover,\nthe rivers were superimposed on the older underlying\nstructure, and hence inherited a palaeotopography of\npossible Late Palaeozoic age (Davies, 1960, 1970;\nMitchell, 1980). The cover rocks were most likely\nUpper Cretaceous limestone (Walsh, 1966; Naylor,\n1992), deposited during a time of maximum global\nsea-level rise (Haq, Hardenbol & Vail, 1987). This\nhypothesis is partly supported by the widespread\noccurrences of flint in glacial deposits of southeastern\nIreland (Davies, 1970).\nThe northern part of the Blackstairs Mountains\nextends for 17 km northeast from the River Slaney, at\nBunclody (Fig. 1a). This ridge of hills is underlain by\nschist and sheared, chilled marginal granite (Fig. 1b)\nand rises to 280 m above the Tullow Lowland, but does\nnot form a watershed boundary. Four rivers cross the\naxis of the ridge, along with four additional dry valleys.\nHence, it has been suggested that the Tullow Lowland\nmust have stood higher than the ridge, assuming that\nthe rivers initially flowed to the southeast across it\n(Farrington, 1927; Davies, 1960; Davies & Stephens,\n1978). Davies (1960, 1970) noted that the granitic\nsummits of the Wicklow Mountains are probably very\nclose to the original roof of the batholith and suggested\nthat the northern part of the Wicklow Mountains had\nonly recently lost its protective schist and younger\ncover, to expose the granite beneath. Conversely, he\nargued that the granite in the Tullow Lowland had been\nexposed for a greater period of time and hence was\nmore deeply eroded.\n2.b. Problems\nSeveral geological and geophysical observations cast\nsome doubt on these models of landscape evolution.\nGranitic rocks of the Leinster Granite batholith are\ncontinuous beneath both the Tullow Lowland (Tullow\npluton) and adjacent high ground to the north\n(Lugnaquillia pluton), suggesting that differential resis-\ntance to erosion is not responsible for present-day\ndifferences in elevation. The survival of roof features\nof the batholith both on the Tullow Lowland (Bru\u00a8ck\n& O\u2019Connor, 1980) and at higher elevations in the\nWicklow Mountains to the north is also incompatible\nwith strongly spatially heterogeneous erosion. Parts of\nthe batholith were exposed in Late Devonian and Early\nCarboniferous times and so it is unlikely that portions\nof the batholith roof would have survived to the present\nday.\nA further argument against deep differential erosion\nof the Leinster Granite in the Tullow Lowland area is the\nCenozoic tectonic activity in SE Ireland 103\nFigure 1.

CUNNINGHAM AND OTHERS\npresence of a very low Bouguer gravity anomaly (\u201330 to\n\u201335 mGal) beneath the lowland (Readman, O\u2019Reilly &\nMurphy, 1997). Negative Bouguer gravity anomalies in\nIreland are restricted to regions underlain by significant\ngranitic plutons. In general, the Leinster Granite\nbatholith was asymmetrically emplaced along a NNE\u2013\nSSW axis (Brindley, 1973) as five dome-like plutons\nwith an en-echelon arrangement. The low Bouguer\ngravity occurs over much of the Tullow Lowland\nand therefore is unlikely to reflect the emplacement\ngeometry of the granite body. Unless the Leinster\nGranite was originally very much thicker beneath the\nTullow Lowland, the low Bouguer gravity observations\nrule out significant localized denudation. The presence\nof roof features on the northwest margin of the Tullow\npluton, however, is inconsistent with a deeply eroded\nsector of granite here (Fig. 1b).\nThe Tullow Lowland extends westwards and cuts\nacross Lower Carboniferous limestones which show\nevidence of prolonged weathering such as hum and\ndoline topography (Mitchell, 1980) and the Miocene\u2013\nLower Pliocene sub-aerial deposits at Hollymount\nand Ballyelin, preserved in conical pipes on the\nCarboniferous limestone surface (Fig. 1a) (Mitchell,\n1980; Naylor, 1992). The lowland also features relict\ngranite hills (tors) and abundant granite core-stones\n(Farrington, 1934). These features suggest that the\nTullow Lowland represents a mature eroded plain of\nat least post-early Pliocene age.\n3. Evidence for differential displacements from\napatite fission-track data\nIf denudation has been strongly spatially or temporally\nheterogeneous across southeastern Ireland, or if post-\nPalaeozoic cover rocks have been unevenly deposited\nand then stripped off, then we may be able to\nresolve those heterogeneities using apatite fission-track\nanalysis. Fission tracks are linear damage trails in a\ncrystal lattice produced by the spontaneous fission of\nthe isotope 238U. Fission tracks in apatite shorten, or\nanneal, irreversibly when the host mineral is at elevated\ntemperatures. The rate of annealing increases with\nincreasing temperature and is a function of time, or\nduration, of exposure to a given temperature. Laslett\net al. (1987) developed an empirical annealing model,\ncalibrated on laboratory experiments performed on\na mono-compositional Durango apatite (Young et al.\n1969). Extrapolation of this model to geological time-\nscales predicts a partial annealing temperature range\nfrom \u223c 60 \u25e6C to \u223c 110 \u25e6C with an uncertainty of about\n10 \u25e6C (for timescales of 1\u2013100 Myr). At temperatures\nabove 110 \u00b1 10 \u25e6C, all tracks are completely annealed\nover geological timescales, while at temperatures\nbelow 60 \u00b1 10 \u25e6C, partial annealing is negligible. This\ntemperature interval of 60 to 110 \u00b1 10 \u25e6C is known\nas the partial annealing zone (Fig. 2) (see Gallagher,\nBrown & Johnson, 1998, for discussion).\nPrevious apatite fission-track studies of Ireland, the\nIrish Sea, and parts of northern and western Britain\nhave consistently shown evidence for two cooling\nevents during Cenozoic time (Green et al. 1993, 1999;\nAllen et al. 2002). The first event occurred during\nthe early Palaeogene period and may be attributed to\nmagmatic underplating related to the Iceland hot-spot\n(e.g. White & Lovell, 1997). The timing and magnitude\nof the second event is very poorly constrained at\npresent, and while it is generally assigned a post-\nMiddle Miocene age, its existence must be regarded as\nsomewhat speculative (Lewis et al. 1992; Cope, 1994,\n1998; Green et al. 1993, 1999; Allen et al. 2002).\nAllen et al. (2002) quantitatively evaluated the post-\nVariscan thermal and denudational history of Ireland\nusing an extensive new apatite fission-track dataset\nderived from surface samples. Stochastic modelling of\nsample thermal histories (Gallagher, 1995) was used\nto produce denudation maps for a series of time-slices\nfrom Triassic to present using time-dependent palaeo-\ngeotherms. The results document moderate rates of\ndenudation around known igneous centres (e.g. the\nMourne Mountains of County Down and the Leinster\nGranite batholith of southeastern Ireland) during Ceno-\nzoic time (Table 1). Allen et al. (2002) documented\nbroad patterns of Cenozoic cooling and denudation\nacross Ireland, but did not specifically investigate the\ndenudational history of particular regions. In order\nto address the issues of spatially variable denudation\nand landscape evolution in southeastern Ireland, we re-\nanalysed a subset of the Allen et al. (2002) apatite\nfission-track database that covers the Wicklow and\nBlackstairs Mountains and the Tullow Lowland. (For\ndetailed discussion of the samples, data collection and\nanalysis procedures, see Allen et al. 2002.) We first\ncompare apatite fission-track central age with elevation\nfor our subset of samples to evaluate the possibility of\nlocal perturbations caused, for example, by differential\ndisplacements or localized heating events. We then\nre-model the sample thermal histories with tighter\ngeological constraints to determine the extent and\ntiming of thermal events across the region.\n3.a. Elevation\u2013central age relationships\nIn a vertical profile of apatite fission-track central age\nversus sample depth, the partial annealing zone is\nvisible as a segment of the profile in which central age\nis inversely proportional to depth (Fig. 2); above and\nbelow the partial annealing zone this correlation is not\nobserved (e.g. Fitzgerald et al. 1995). In a landscape\nthat has undergone strong denudation, a \u2018fossilized\u2019\npartial annealing zone may thus show up as a monotonic\nrelationship between central age and present-day\nsample elevation. Deviations from this relationship\nmay result from local effects such as differential rock\nuplift after cooling, localized heating events that reset\nsome samples, or strongly heterogeneous denudation.\nC\nenozoic\ntectonic\nactivity\nin\nSE\nIreland\n105\nTable 1.

(b) A sudden increase in the\nrate of denudation at time t1 after a period of prolonged\nstability exhumes the existing partial annealing zone (Brown,\nSummerfield & Gleadow, 1994, Fitzgerald et al. 1995). The\nbreak in slope in the exhumed profile (marked by the asterisk)\nshows where the apatite fission-track ages were at zero prior to\nexhumation. The apatite fission-track age at this point coincides\nwith timing of cooling below 110 \u00b1 10 \u25e6C, that is, time t1, thus\nyielding the age of increased denudation rates (assuming a rapid\nrise through the partial annealing zone). The oldest ages in the\nexhumed profile will therefore be the sum of the pre-exhumation\nage and the age of onset of increased denudation rate, that is,\nt0 + t1.\nFrom the Allen et al. (2002) apatite fission-track\ndatabase, we selected samples that lie along a NNE-\ntrending profile that is roughly coincident with the\ndrainage divide of the Wicklow Mountains (Fig. 3a),\ncontinuing south across the Tullow Lowland and\nover the Blackstairs Mountains. The bedrock geology\nunderlying the profile is dominantly granite, with\noccasional roof pendants of schist (Fig. 3b). In the\nnorthern Wicklow Mountains, sample central age\n(Allen et al. 2002) increases with elevation, with a\nbroadly linear to curvilinear relationship consistent\nwith a fossilized partial annealing zone (Fig. 3c). With\nfew exceptions, samples from north and south of the\nLough Dan fault (Fig. 3b) plot along different, sub-\nparallel profiles, separated by \u223c 300 m in elevation\nor \u223c 20 Myr in central age (Fig. 3c). In the southern\nWicklow Mountains, sample LG36, near the summit of\nLugnaquillia, lies about 480 m above sample LG26,\nwhich lies at the northern margin of the Tullow\nLowland, and about 620 m above sample LG23, from\nthe Tullow Lowland. All three samples have similar\napatite fission-track central ages within 1\u03c3 error\n(Table 1; Figure 3).\nThese results suggest that the apatite fission-track\nsamples from the Wicklow Mountains may be naturally\ndivided in to two discrete spatial domains, a Northern\nDomain to the north and a Lugnaquillia Domain\nto the south, separated by approximately 300 m of\nelevation. The domain boundary is likely to be the\nLough Dan fault. Samples in the Lugnaquillia Domain\n(LG17, LG18, LG21 and LG36) lie 500 to 600 m\nhigher than the similarly aged sample LG23 in the\nTullow Lowland. From this we infer that samples LG23\nand LG32 represent a separate, low-elevation domain,\ntermed the Tullow Domain. Sample LG26, which lies\nat an intermediate elevation between the Lugnaquillia\nand Tullow domains, is difficult to attribute to either\ndomain. If sample LG26 belongs to the Tullow Domain,\nthen the domain boundary is likely to be the NW-\ntrending Ow River fault (Fig. 3a). If instead it belongs\nto the Lugnaquillia Domain, then the domain boundary\nis approximately coincident with a WNW-trending\ntopographic escarpment, here termed the Baltinglass\nEscarpment, which was interpreted as a Cenozoic fault\nby Mitchell & Ryan (1997) and which we discuss in\nSection 4.b. In turn, the Tullow Domain may be distinct\nfrom a separate domain in the Blackstairs Mountains\ndefined by sample LG28, but we lack sufficient samples\nto test this hypothesis. We do note, however, that\nsample LG28 is separated from the Tullow Domain\nby a topographic escarpment along the southeastern\nmargin of the Tullow Lowland which is coincident\nwith the East Carlow deformation zone, a multiply\nreactivated SE-dipping shear zone with evidence of\nlate, brittle dip-slip deformation (McArdle & Kennedy,\n1985). The Lough Dan and Ow River faults have\npreviously been identified as Caledonian and acted as\nmajor hydrothermal pathways during the Variscan (e.g.\nBru\u00a8ck & O\u2019Connor, 1980).\n3.b. Thermal history modelling strategy\nWhile the relationship between apatite fission-track\ncentral age and elevation allows us to divide the apatite\nfission-track samples from the Wicklow and Blackstairs\nMountains into discrete domains (Fig. 3), it does not\nexplain the mechanisms by which the domains arose\nC\nenozoic\ntectonic\nactivity\nin\nSE\nIreland\n107\nFigure 3.

Note that, in general, groups of samples define curvilinear relationships\n(Profiles 1 and 2). We divide samples into three structural domains: the Northern Domain (north of Lough Dan fault), Lugnaquillia Domain (between Lough Dan fault and Ow River fault\nor Baltinglass Escarpment), and the Tullow Domain (south of Baltinglass Escarpment). Sample LG28 may define a separate domain in the Blackstairs Mountains (south of the East Carlow\ndeformation zone).\n108 M. J. M. CUNNINGHAM AND OTHERS\nor the timing of their origin. Variations in the age\u2013\nelevation relationship might be due to (1) differential\ndenudation between two samples, with no movement\nrelative to the geoid (yielding variations in central age);\nor (2) differential rock uplift between the samples,\nwith no difference in denudation (yielding variations\nin elevation). To understand better the origins of these\ndomains, and to explore the possibility that they may\nbe due to Cenozoic tectonics, we employ an inverse\nnumerical model to derive thermal histories for samples\nin each of the three domains.\n3.b.1. Rationale for re-modelling samples\nThermal history modelling was undertaken using an\niterative search procedure based on the maximum\nlikelihood statistic as outlined in Gallagher (1995),\ncombined with the annealing model of Laslett et al.\n(1987). Briefly, this method requires the specification\nof a series of time\u2013temperature windows (sub-regions\nin time\u2013temperature space which may or may not over-\nlap), from which points on a possible thermal history\nare selected. Linear interpolation is used to construct a\nsmooth thermal history function, which is then used to\nmake a prediction of the fission-track parameters (age\nand length distribution). The strategy adopted uses a\ngenetic algorithm to focus in on the thermal meaning\nhistories that provide better fits to the observed data.\nThe thermal histories are smoothed before predicting\nthe fission-track parameters to avoid overly complex\nstructure in the thermal histories. The inferred thermal\nhistories that best fit each apatite fission-track central\nage and fission-track length distribution are sensitive\nto the choice of constraints on the time\u2013temperature\npath. The procedure requires the input of stratigraphic\nage and time\u2013temperature windows through which the\nmodelled thermal history passes (Gallagher, 1995).\nAllen et al. (2002) modelled the entire Irish sample set\nusing time\u2013temperature windows with broad bounds in\ntemperature and overlaps in time so as not to restrict\nthe modelling process. They used the same time\u2013\ntemperature windows for all samples across the Irish\nlandmass for consistency.\nHere we re-derive thermal histories for the sample\nprofile using a more locally appropriate series of time\u2013\ntemperature windows based on geological observations\nof the Wicklow and Blackstairs Mountains region and\nadjacent areas offshore. Whilst doing this, we have kept\nthe time\u2013temperature constraints as loose as possible\nto allow for a wide range of possible solutions to be\nconsidered.\n3.b.2. Geological constraints\nAll the apatite fission-track samples analysed in\nthis study are plutonic rocks from the Leinster\nGranite batholith, which has a crystallization age of\n404 \u00b1 24 Ma (O\u2019Connor & Bru\u00a8ck, 1978). The first\ntime\u2013temperature window is therefore chosen to con-\nstrain the temperature to be in excess of the full anneal-\ning (closure) temperature for apatite (110 \u00b1 10 \u25e6C) at\n404 \u00b1 24 Ma. The second window allows for significant\ncooling and partial unroofing of the batholith during\nthe Devonian period with temperatures of 70 \u00b1 50 \u25e6C\nat 370 \u00b1 20 Ma. Tectonic and thermal events associ-\nated with the Variscan orogeny caused widespread\ndeformation in southern Ireland and resulted in high\nthermal maturity (Clayton et al. 1989), assumed to\nhave been imparted in Late Carboniferous time. The\nthird window, with temperatures of 90 \u00b1 30 \u25e6C at\n300 \u00b1 20 Ma (Late Carboniferous to Early Permian),\nis chosen to represent this Variscan heating.\nLower Jurassic sediments in the Celtic Sea Basins\nare thought to be derived, in part, from exposed Old\nRed Sandstone rocks in southwestern Ireland and\nfrom the Wicklow Mountains region (Petrie et al.\n1989). Likewise, the Kish Bank and Cardigan Bay\nbasins accumulated great thicknesses of Lower Jurassic\nsediments (e.g. Broughan, Naylor & Anstley, 1989).\nThe presence of Middle Jurassic red beds and Upper\nJurassic fluviolacustrine deposits along the northern\nflank of the Celtic Sea Basins, however, suggests\nthat southeastern Ireland was an area of sub-aerial\ntopography and a sediment source throughout much\nof the Jurassic period. Therefore, the corresponding\nwindow is chosen as 70 \u00b1 50 \u25e6C at 180 \u00b1 30 Ma to\nallow for the possibility of relatively cool temperatures\nat shallow burial depths during Jurassic time.\nIn the southern offshore basins, Lower Cretaceous\ncontinental Wealden sedimentary rocks pass up into\nLower Cretaceous marine sandstones and shales,\noverlain unconformably by Upper Cretaceous chalks\n(Naylor & Shannon, 1982). This suggests that the\nIrish landmass became progressively flooded during\nthe Cretaceous period. To allow for the possibility\nof burial and heating of southeastern Ireland under a\nsedimentary overburden, the corresponding window is\nchosen as 90 \u00b1 50 \u25e6C at 110 \u00b1 40 Ma.\nA regional unconformity exists within all the\nsedimentary basins off southern Ireland overly-\ning Cenomanian\u2013Maastrichtian chalks (Naylor &\nShannon, 1982) with the amplitude of erosion increas-\ning towards the Irish Sea (Blundell, 1979; Rowley &\nWhite, 1998). An extensive vitrinite reflectance and\napatite fission-track database in the Irish Sea area\nsuggests regional denudation during Palaeogene time.\nIn order to capture a wide range of thermal possibilities\nduring Cenozoic time, we have chosen four highly\npermissive time\u2013temperature windows at 70 \u00b1 10 Ma,\n50 \u00b1 10 Ma, 30 \u00b1 10 Ma, and 10 \u00b1 10 Ma, each with\nallowable temperatures of 60 \u00b1 60 \u25e6C. The final con-\nstraint is the present day temperature of 10 \u00b1 10 \u25e6C.\n3.c.

Note that, in all cases, samples experienced a long period of residence in the partial annealing zone,\nfollowed by Paleogene cooling. Post-early Eocene thermal histories differ, but all samples show mid-Cenozoic heating followed by\nrelatively late cooling. Consistent thermal histories across the region suggest that present-day elevations were established late in the\nthermal history after Paleogene cooling.\ndistributions, are shown in Figure 4. The most striking\nresult is the strong similarity in the temperature\u2013time\nhistory between the samples, regardless of their loca-\ntion or present-day elevation. All of the samples show\nrapid cooling shortly after crystallization, followed by\nslow heating and a long period of residence in the\npartial annealing zone. This phase of partial annealing\nis followed in all cases by cooling to <60 \u25e6C during the\nPaleocene to early Eocene. Details of the later Cenozoic\nthermal histories differ between samples, but in all\ncases they show slight heating during late Paleogene or\nNeogene times to temperatures of >60 \u25e6C, followed by\n110 M. J. M. CUNNINGHAM AND OTHERS\ncooling to the present day. Overall, the thermal histories\ninferred here are broadly consistent with the findings of\nother regional apatite fission-track studies (e.g. Keeley\net al. 1993; Green et al. 1999, 2000; Allen et al. 2002).\nBased on the re-modelling of the apatite fission-track\nsamples, it appears that the Wicklow and Blackstairs\nMountains and the Tullow Lowland underwent a con-\nsistent thermal history up to, and including, an episode\nof cooling during the Palaeogene at \u223c 55 \u00b1 4 Ma.\nImportantly, we see no evidence of strong differential\ndenudation between samples in different domains.\nThus, for example, sample LG23 from the Tullow\nLowland has a similar thermal history to samples from\nLugnaquillia (LG36) and Mt Leinster (LG28), despite\nelevation differences of 620 and 680 m, respectively\n(Fig. 4). If these elevation differences, and the low\nrelief of the Tullow Lowland, were due to extensive\nand localized denudation (e.g. Davies, 1970), then we\nwould expect to see cooling specific to the Tullow\nLowland. Instead, the consistent thermal histories\nacross the region suggest that both highland and\nlowland samples experienced the same thermal history\nat least until late Paleocene or early Eocene time.\nThus, the present offsets in elevation\u2013age profiles (e.g.\nFigure 3c) must be due, not to differential denudation,\nbut to differential rock uplift that post-dates sample\nresidence in the partial annealing zone, and which\ntherefore must be post-early Eocene in age. Subtle\nheating variations of the apatite fission-track samples\nin Early Neogene time (Fig. 4, Table 1) may be due\nto differential localized isostatic effects arising from\ndenudation of fault blocks but this is not resolvable\nusing current apatite fission-track analysis techniques.\n3.d. Summary of apatite fission-track results\nApatite fission-track samples from the Wicklow and\nBlackstairs Mountains and Tullow Lowland appear\nto record a fossilized partial annealing zone, and\ngroup into at least three distinct spatial domains.\nThe broad similarity of modelled thermal histories\nacross the region argues that present-day differences\nin elevation are due not to differential denudation\nbut to differential rock uplift that occurred in post-\nearly Eocene time, when temperatures cooled below\n60 \u00b1 10 \u25e6C. This differential movement may have been\naccommodated on specific faults, including the Lough\nDan and Ow River faults, and\/or the Baltinglass\nEscarpment, and the East Carlow deformation zone,\nwhich appear to bound blocks with internally consistent\nelevation\u2013central age relationships. The magnitude of\nthe displacements, as determined by offset of the\ncentral age\u2013elevation profiles, ranges from \u223c 300 m\nacross the Lough Dan fault to \u223c 600\u2013700 m on the\nOw River fault or the Baltinglass Escarpment. The\nconsistent timing of Palaeogene cooling suggests that\ndifferential displacement must have begun sometime\nafter approximately 50 Ma.\n4. Geomorphic indicators of tectonic activity\nThe topography of a region reflects the time-\nintegrated effects of both tectonic and climatic activity\n(Summerfield, 1994). If southeastern Ireland has been\naffected by differential rock uplift of up to several\nhundred metres in post-early Eocene time, as we\nsuggest from the apatite fission-track analysis, then\nwe expect some evidence of this deformation to be\npreserved in the landscape. To test for this, we analyse\nthe spatial patterns of the two largest river systems\ndraining the region: the rivers Slaney and Barrow\n(Fig. 1). Lacking appropriate Cenozoic sediments, we\ncannot use geomorphic observations to corroborate\nthe timing of deformation in southeastern Ireland.\nWe show, however, that the major rivers are out of\nequilibrium with the present topography in a manner\nthat is consistent with the locations, magnitudes and\nkinematics of displacements inferred from the apatite\nfission-track analysis.\n4.a. Rivers Slaney and Barrow\nThe River Slaney rises in the southwestern Wicklow\nMountains and flows southeastwards across the Tullow\nLowland and the Blackstairs Mountains (Fig. 1). The\nsoutheastern margin of the Tullow Lowland is bounded\nby a NE-trending escarpment with peak elevations of\nup to 400 m asl. The escarpment is divided into discrete\nhills by a number of SE-trending valleys (Farrington,\n1927). However, only four of these valleys contain\ntransverse rivers that flow southeastwards across the\nridge: from northwest to southeast, they are the rivers\nSlaney, Barrow, Nore and Derry (Fig. 1). These four\ncatchments cut directly across the topography and\nthe underlying NE-striking Caledonian structural grain\n(Fig. 5). The remaining valleys are presently dry and\nform wind gaps (Fig. 5).\nAcross the Tullow Lowland, the River Slaney has\nincised less than 10 m into the landscape and has a\nmoderate sinuosity, expressed as the ratio of thalweg\nto straight-line distance, of 1.36 (Fig. 5). About 7 km\nupstream of the escarpment, the course of the Slaney\nabruptly straightens, with a sinuosity of 1.02 over\nthe next 8 km. Along this reach, incision increases to\n50 m as the river crosses the escarpment. Downstream\nof the escarpment, sinuosity abruptly increases again to\n1.37 over the next 10.5 km reach. On the southeastern\nside of the Blackstairs Mountains, sinuosity decreases\nto 1.17.\nThe River Barrow shows a similar increase in\nincision from 5 to 60 m as it flows south toward\nthe Blackstairs Mountains, and has an equally abrupt\nincrease in sinuosity as it flows across the axis of the\nBlackstairs Mountains (Fig. 6).\nDavies (1970) suggested that the Slaney and Barrow\nmight have originally flowed southeastwards across a\nwidespread, low-relief surface, perhaps composed of\nCenozoic tectonic activity in SE Ireland 111\nFigure 5. (a) Bedrock geology map of the Bunclody area\n(after Tietzsch-Tyler & Sleeman, 1994), overlain on shaded-\nrelief image of topography; see Figure 1 for location. The\nhatched pattern shows extent of the East Carlow deformation\nzone as mapped by McArdle & Kennedy (1985). The River\nSlaney flows from northwest to southeast across the East Carlow\ndeformation zone. Sinuosity of the River Slaney is shown for\nreaches upstream, within, and downstream of the Blackstairs\nMountains; white bars show boundaries between reaches. White\nhexagons show the locations of dry valleys. (b) Perspective view\nof the same area, looking to the northwest. The River Slaney\nincises along the straight reach shown by the arrows.\nCretaceous chalk, and would have gradually incised\ninto pre-Cretaceous basement rocks. This model, how-\never, is contradicted by the continuity of the Leinster\nGranite batholith across the escarpment. Because the\nLeinster Granite batholith underlies both the Tullow\nLowland and the highest peaks of the Blackstairs\nMountains, it is difficult to call on erodibility as\nthe source of the present topography. Davies\u2019 (1970)\nmodel also fails to account for abrupt changes in\nsinuosity along the rivers Slaney and Barrow and fails\nto explain why incision along both rivers begins several\nkilometres upstream of the escarpment in an area of low\nrelief.\nA more plausible explanation for the present\ntopography and river pattern, one which accounts for\nthe sinuosity and incision observations, is vertical\ndisplacement (southeast side up) along the southeastern\nmargin of the Tullow Lowland, perhaps along the SE-\ndipping East Carlow deformation zone. We infer that\ndisplacement along the East Carlow deformation zone\nhas beheaded smaller catchments, whose stream power\nwas insufficient to keep pace with rock uplift through\neither incision or aggradation (cf. Burbank, Meigs &\nBrozovic, 1996; Humphrey & Konrad, 2000). Only the\nfour largest catchments (the rivers Slaney, Barrow, Nore\nand Derry) possessed sufficient power to maintain their\nexisting courses across the growing escarpment.\nThe changes in sinuosity and depth of incision\nalong the Slaney are consistent with the response\nof an alluvial river to rock uplift. Energy slope is\nheld approximately constant, and so river slope is\nincreased upstream of the uplift axis through incision\nand a decrease in sinuosity. Conversely, river slope\ndecreases, and sinuosity increases, downstream of\nthe uplift axis (Ouchi, 1985; Schumm, 1986). The\ntransition from straight to meandering behaviour along\nthe Slaney, which should correspond to the rock\nuplift axis, occurs within the East Carlow deformation\nzone as mapped by McArdle & Kennedy (1985);\nhowever, the Slaney has incised along a \u223c 15 km\nreach upstream and downstream of this point (Fig. 5),\nsuggesting that the river is responding to base-level\nchange over a relatively broad region. Eustatic changes\nare incapable of producing this incision, as they\ncannot produce the wind-gaps observed throughout\nthe Blackstairs Mountains along the trace of the East\nCarlow deformation zone.

Southern Wicklow Mountains and\nthe Baltinglass Escarpment\nA steep, linear, WNW-trending escarpment, termed\nthe Baltinglass Escarpment, separates bedrock of the\nsouthwestern Wicklow Mountains from that of the\nTullow Lowland (Fig. 7). The escarpment forms a\nlinear range of hills, and so its height is variable along\nstrike, ranging from 150 to 250 m asl, but nowhere is\nthe relief less than \u223c 50 m. At its westernmost end,\nthe escarpment is roughly coincident with a complex\ncontact between the Leinster Granite batholith to the\n112 M. J. M. CUNNINGHAM AND OTHERS\nFigure 6.

Light solid lines show tributaries and minor streams. Dashed line is the drainage\ndivide between north-flowing and south-flowing streams. Note that dip-slip motion has caused northward tilting of the region north of\nthe escarpment, creating and maintaining a drainage divide very close to the fault. Short, southward draining streams have incised into\nthe up-thrown block.\nCenozoic tectonic activity in SE Ireland 113\nsouth, and Ordovician slate, schist and tuff to the north\n(Fig. 1b). The eastern 10 km of the escarpment lies\nentirely within the Leinster Granite batholith. North\nof the escarpment, relief between valley bottoms and\nadjacent ridge crests is commonly in excess of 300 m,\nwhereas the greatest valley-to-ridge relief in the Tullow\nLowland is less than 50 m.\nDespite this strong contrast in elevation and relief,\nonly one large river (the Slaney) flows from north to\nsouth across the escarpment (Fig. 7). East of the Slaney,\na number of small, south-flowing catchments drain\na narrow area immediately north of the escarpment.\nThese catchments are typically incised 10 to 20 m into\nbedrock as they cross the escarpment; these deeply\nincised valleys are set into much larger valleys or\ngaps between hills. The drainage divide between north-\nand south-flowing catchments lies \u223c 1 km north of the\ntopographic escarpment.\nThe escarpment is only partly coincident with\nmapped lithological boundaries, and the main contrast\nin erodibility, between granitic rocks and Ordovician\nschist (Farrington, 1927), lies to the north of the es-\ncarpment. Thus a lithological origin of the escarpment\nseems unlikely.\nAnother possibility is that the escarpment is a palaeo-\nseacliff. The base of the escarpment lies at an elevation\nof \u223c 130 m asl along most of its length. However,\ncoastal erosion processes are unlikely to give rise to\na drainage divide in such close proximity to the escarp-\nment and the Tullow Lowland displays landforms con-\nsistent with prolonged sub-aerial exposure and denud-\nation (Boulter, 1980; Mitchell, 1980; Naylor, 1992).\nMitchell & Ryan (1997) suggested that the escarp-\nment might be tectonic in origin based on its linearity,\nwith a postulated vertical displacement of \u223c 800 m.\nThe geomorphic evidence outlined above supports\nthis suggestion, and we thus interpret the escarpment\nas the surface expression of a previously unmapped\nfault (Fig. 7). The linear nature of the escarpment\nis also consistent with the typical morphology of\nrange fronts defined by dip-slip faults. Dip-slip motion\nhas caused northward tilting of the region north of\nthe escarpment (e.g. Stein, King & Rundle, 1988),\ncreating and maintaining a drainage divide very close\nto the fault. Short, southward-draining streams have\nincised into the upthrown Wicklow Mountains block,\nconsistent with base-level fall along the escarpment.\nThis suggests that the differential movement between\nthe Lugnaquillia and Tullow domains implied by our\napatite fission-track data may have mostly occurred on\nthe Baltinglass Escarpment, rather than the Ow River\nfault, to account for the differences in elevation between\napatite fission-track samples LG36, LG26 and LG23.\n5. Discussion\nWe suggest, on the basis of apatite fission-track\nelevation\u2013age relationships and thermal history mod-\nFigure 8.

Note the similar orientation\nand kinematics of the Newry (NF) and Codling (CdF) faults.\nAlso note that kinematics of faults in the Kish Bank region are\ncompatible with the post-Oligocene fault displacements (black\narrows) determined for the Lough Neagh region by I.

Post-early Eocene\ndifferential vertical displacements of up to several\nhundred metres occurred between these domains.\nThe boundaries between the domains correspond to\nrecognizable topographic and geological structures,\nand geomorphic observations support both the inferred\nkinematics and magnitudes of the displacements on\nthese structures. The lack of widespread Cenozoic\nsediments or depositional landforms, however, prevents\nus from refining the timing of deformation beyond\npost-late Paleocene time. Because of the age and\ninherited nature of some of the structures (e.g.\nthe East Carlow deformation zone), along with the\ngeneral difficulty of inverting strain for stress, any\nattempt to reconcile the inferred displacements with\nan overall state of stress would be highly speculative in\nisolation. The orientations and kinematics of post-early\nEocene structures in southeastern Ireland, however, are\nconsistent with known Cenozoic deformation observed\n114 M. J. M.

This is not surprising,\ngiven the small spatial scale of the Irish landmass and its\nproximity to a number of well-studied offshore basins.\nIn northeastern Ireland, early Cenozoic sinistral tran-\nstensional movement on the NE-trending Toe Valley,\nSix Mile and Congo faults, and dextral transtension\non the NNW-trending Newry fault, resulted in the\nformation of pull-apart basins, including the Lough\nNeagh Basin (Fig. 8). These basins were filled with\na thick sequence of Oligocene clays and lignites\n(George, 1967; Fletcher, 1977; Parnell, Shukla &\nMeighan, 1988; Naylor, 1992), and fault activity on\nthe Newry fault is inferred to have continued into\npost-Oligocene time (Jenner, 1981; Parnell, Shukla &\nMeighan, 1988; Geoffroy, Bergerat & Angelier, 1996;\nReadman, O\u2019Reilly & Murphy, 1997). The Newry\nfault has been extended south to join the Codling\nfault, which lies \u223c 30 km offshore to the east of the\nDublin Basin and the Wicklow Mountains (Fig. 9). The\nCodling fault in turn has dextrally offset the Lambay\nand Dalkey faults by about 4 km during post-Liassic\ntime (Jenner, 1981; Broughan, Naylor & Anstley, 1989;\nNaylor et al. 1993), and appears to have been active\ninto the Late Cenozoic (Corcoran & Clayton, 1999;\nDunford, Dancer & Long, 2001). The correlation\nbetween the Newry and Codling faults is consistent\nwith models of Cenozoic dextral shear on NW-trending\nfaults in southwestern England and Cardigan Bay\n(Turner, 1997), including the Neogene dextral-reverse\nSticklepath fault (Fig. 9; Bristow & Hughes, 1971).\nOur inferred displacements are also consistent\nwith Cenozoic deformation observed in a number\nof offshore basins. These include (1) post-Oligocene\ninversion of the North Celtic Sea Basin (Murdoch,\nMusgrove & Perry, 1995) and the Slyne Trough\n(Scotchman & Thomas, 1995); (2) post-mid-Miocene\ndeformation in the Porcupine Basin (Tate, 1993;\nMcCann, Shannon & Moore, 1995); (3) late Eocene\nto mid-Oligocene folding and sinistral deformation at\nthe eastern margin of the Rockall Trough (C. Solla-\nHach, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, Univ. Dublin, 2002); and\n(6) Late Palaeogene and Early Neogene inversion of\nthe Cockburn Basin (Smith, 1995).\nIn addition, a number of workers have documented\nsignificant Neogene sedimentation and tectonic activity\nCenozoic tectonic activity in SE Ireland 115\n(e.g. Stoker, 1997; Japsen, Boldreel & Chalmers,\n1998) along portions of the northwestern European\ncontinental margin, much of was summarized by Japsen\n(1997) and Dore\u00b4 et al. (1999). Previous regional apatite\nfission-track studies have consistently shown evidence\nfor a mid-Cenozoic cooling event, beginning \u223c 30 Ma\nand involving > 1 km of inferred denudation (Lewis\net al. 1992; Green et al. 1993, 1999; Rohrman et al.\n1995). Compaction studies and burial estimates give\nrise to similar magnitudes of Cenozoic denudation (e.g.\nBulat & Stoker, 1987; Murdoch, Musgrove & Perry,\n1995; Japsen, 1997).\nThe mechanisms driving this late activity are enig-\nmatic. Va\u02dagnes & Amundsen (1993) called on secon-\ndary mantle convection and underplating. Rohrman\n& van der Beek (1996) invoked asthenospheric\ndiapirism resulting from a Rayleigh-Taylor instability,\narguing that the initiation of Neogene tectonic and\nmagmatic activity coincided with the imposition of hot\nIceland plume asthenosphere beneath the margin of the\nEuropean continental lithosphere at \u223c 30 Ma. Rohrman\n& van der Beek (1996) indicated that the northern UK\nand Ireland should be underlain by an asthenospheric\ndiapir, potentially causing both transient and permanent\ntectonic rock uplift. Dewey (2000) concluded that\nnorthwestern Europe was caught in the jaws of a\ncompressional vice, from 22 to 9 Ma, created by strong\nconvergence between Africa and Europe and North\nAtlantic ridge push forces.\nThis diapirism, combined with ridge-derived and\nAfrican compressional intra-plate stresses, may well\nprovide the impetus for the displacements we observe.\nGiven typical rates of denudational processes (e.g.\nSummerfield, 1994) and the likely adjustment time-\nscales of Irish rivers, this tectonic and erosional activity\nshould be reflected in the modern Irish landscape.\nThis implies widespread denudation and possible rock\nuplift within the region during post-Paleocene time,\nconsistent with our inference of tectonic activity in and\naround Ireland during this period.\n6. Conclusions\n(1) Relationships between apatite fission-track central\nage and elevation for Leinster Granite samples in\nthe Wicklow and Blackstairs Mountains and Tullow\nLowland, southeastern Ireland, lead us to suggest that\nthese areas can be divided into at least three discrete\nstructural domains. Each domain shows evidence for\nan exhumed apatite partial annealing zone.\n(2) The domains preserve evidence for an exhumed\npartial annealing zone that is vertically offset across\ndomain boundaries by up to several hundred metres,\nand these boundaries appear to be coincident with\nknown crustal-scale faults or topographic escarpments.\n(3) Thermal modelling of samples along a transect\nacross southeastern Ireland shows that all samples\nexperienced remarkably similar thermal histories up to\nand including a cooling event in late Paleocene or early\nEocene time. Thus, the differential rock uplift that led\nto dismemberment of the partial annealing zone must\npost-date this cooling event.\n(4) Geomorphic analysis of the East Carlow deform-\nation zone and the Baltinglass Escarpment, both of\nwhich bound the Tullow Domain, shows that spatial\npatterns of catchment incision and sinuosity, as well as\nthe presence of antecedent drainage, are best explained\nby differential vertical displacements at or near the\ndomain boundaries. The kinematics and magnitudes of\nthese displacements are consistent with those implied\nby the apatite fission-track results.\n(5) The kinematics and magnitudes of displace-\nment on the East Carlow deformation zone and the\nBaltinglass Escarpment are compatible with observed\ndeformation on known Cenozoic structures in north-\neastern Ireland, the adjacent offshore basins, and other\nparts of the northwestern European continental margin.\n(6) The geodynamics driving displacements during\nthe Neogene may be attributed to plume diapirism,\nridge-derived intra-plate stresses and convergence\nbetween Africa and Europe from \u223c 30 Ma.\nAcknowledgements.
