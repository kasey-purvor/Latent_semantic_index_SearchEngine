Introduction \nModern science programmes require increasingly large \ntelescopes.  Monolithic mirrors are limited to around 10 m for \nreasons of manufacturing, measurement, and transportation. \nConsequently segmented mirror technology, as applied to the \nKeck telescopes has become the main basis for scaling up. E-\nELT \u2013 figure 1 - and TMT are next generation ground based \ntelescopes presently under development which will require many \nhundreds of metre scale off-axis mirrors [1, 2, 3]. These \nsegments will be made from low expansion glass or glass \nceramics such as ULE\n\u00ae\n, Zerodur\n\u00ae\n, Astrositall\n\u00ae\n or Clearceram\n\u00ae\n. \nTheir successful fabrication places extreme demands on the \nmanufacturing process chain operations, amongst which is \ngrinding, demanding high form accuracy, low sub surface \ndamage and roughness, and critically faster processing times. At \n42 m in diameter the E-ELT primary mirror is constructed from \n984 hexagonal segments, each 1.45 m wide. With a target \ncompletion date of 2018 even conservative estimates place the \nrequired production rate for segments at 1 per day. \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Illustration of proposed E-ELT telescope \n \nPresent \u2018state of the art\u2019 manufacturing technologies for \nproviding metre scale ultra precision mirrors are associated with \nprocessing times of hundreds of hours, consequently the time to \nmanufacture hundreds or even thousands of mirrors for such \nprojects as E-ELT would involve many years of production. \n \nIn order to reduce manufacturing time for large mirrors, a \nnew UK based research initiative was established with the prime \nobjective to reduce processing time of large scale complex shape \nsurfaces [4]. The research proposed a manufacturing chain with \nrapid low-damage precision grinding followed by an iterative \npolishing stage and finally reactive atom plasma figuring, see \nfigure 2. \n \n \nFigure 2 - Proposed process chain for manufacturing large optics \n \nDuring the late 1970\u2019s high precision diamond turning \nmachines were devised to produce large optics in the 1-2 metre \nrange [5, 6]. These were based on proven precision engineering \nprinciples [7] to achieve high motion repeatability with minimal \nerrors. Further enhancements included the use of metrology \nframes, providing motion accuracies in the order of 1 part in 10\n6\n.  \nIn the 1980\u2019s machines such as the OAGM \u2013 off axis grinding \nmachine \u2013 built for Eastman Kodak [8] had a 2.5 m capacity with \na grinding accuracy of approaching 1 part in 10\n6\n. Such state of \nthe art machines today require high levels of investment for both \nacquisition and operation, and do not offer the levels of \nthroughput envisaged for the next generation of ground based \ntelescopes. Parallel research during this period led to the \ndevelopment of novel machine tool structures, leading to highly \nstiff and well damped grinding machines such as the Tetraform \n[9]. These machines demonstrated high performance grinding on \nsmall scale parts. The Cranfield BoX grinding machine has been \ndeveloped based on this philosophy [10] to provide metre scale \ngrinding capability for optics at high removal rates whilst \nminimising levels of sub-surface damage (SSD). This ideally \nplaces BoX to meet the demands of the proposed process chain; \nfigure 3 illustrates how the chain relates to other manufacturing \ntechnologies. \n \n \nFigure 3 \u2013 Manufacturing Chains  \n \nIn this paper the grinding of a 1.45 metre scale mirror \nsegment for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) is \nintroduced. The segment is one of 7 prototypes for the M1 \n(primary) mirror being manufactured under contract for ESO. \nGrinding has been carried out within the Loxham large optics \naspherisation facility at Cranfield, part of the Precision \nEngineering Centre. The facility includes a BoX machine for \ngrinding, Leitz pmmf for large scale metrology, reactive atom \nplasma (RAP) machine for final form figuring, together with the \nspecialist handling and fixturing systems essential for the safe \nand precise handling of large glass segments.  \n \n2. High Performance Precision Grinding  \nTo grind ceramics and glasses rapidly with good form \naccuracy, high levels of \u2018loop\u2019 stiffness are required between the \ngrinding wheel and workpiece. Static loop stiffness is key to the \ntransfer of precise machine motions to the component surface \nprofile. This is especially important at the workpiece edges where \nlow stiffness will result in edge \u2018roll off\u2019 as the contact area \nbetween the grinding wheel and workpiece reduces. Dynamic \nloop stiffness is central to the control of abrasive penetration \nrequired to reduce excessive crack propagation. Higher levels of \ndynamic loop stiffness will counter the higher force and force \nvariation associated with increased material removal rates. The \ncontrol of abrasive penetration depth should be achieved at \nfrequencies well above the operational frequency of the grinding \nspindle in order to prevent irregular levels of SSD, caused \nthrough excitation by the spindle rotation [11]. \n \nIn order to achieve sub-micron levels of form accuracy over \nmetre scale surfaces it is necessary to ensure machine motions \nare highly repeatable and are configured for error correction and \ncompensation techniques.  \n \n3. BoX Grinding Machine \nThe Cranfield BoX ultra precision grinding machine, see \nfigure 4, has been designed for manufacturing high precision low \nslope surfaces. The machine has a novel configuration and \nconstruction with high static and dynamic loop stiffness, together \nwith a compact footprint. To minimise the moving masses, \nmachine motions are achieved using three fundamental axes. \nTwo stacked hydrostatic linear axes (x,z) holding the inclined \nhydrostatic grinding spindle and a single hydrostatic rotary \nspindle (c) supporting the workpiece. \n \n \n \nFigure 4 \u2013 BoX machine  \n \nTo achieve good thermal stability, stray heat transfer from \nthe grinding spindle and linear motors was minimised using high \ndiffusivity materials and active temperature control of motors. \nZerodur gratings were utilised to reduce thermal creep. The \nhydrostatic oil was maintained within +\/-0.1 \u02daC using active \nfeedback and feed forward temperature control. Temperature \ncontrol for linear and rotary motors and grinding coolant was also \nprovided. A non-stressed metrology frame is incorporated into \nthe design using a LVDT probe referenced to a straight edge \nusing a laser interferometer. This system provides the capability \nto carry out in-situ measurement against a traceable artefact for \nerror compensation application. \n \nThe machine configuration employs an R-theta grinding \nmode with an inclined toroidal shape diamond grit cup wheel. \nThe 325 mm external diameter of the wheel is selected to provide \na grinding speed in the range 25-35 m\/s within a rotational \nfrequency range of 25-35 Hz. The radius of curvature of the \nwheel is determined by the geometric contact area between wheel \nand workpiece. For free-form surfaces as the local slope of the \nsurface changes across and around the workpiece, then the \ncontact zone on the grinding wheel moves around the periphery. \nThe grinding mode therefore demands a control system and \nalgorithm strategy to accommodate this changing cutting region \nand peripheral contact zone [12]. \n \n3. Metrology \nOff machine metrology for the free-form surfaces was \nundertaken on a Leitz pmmf . With a capacity of 3 m x 2 m x 1 m \nand equipped with a low force sensing head the machine has a \ntraceable accuracy of 1.9+(L\/400) microns. Tests indicated that \nmicron level repeatability is achievable on this instrument on low \nslope artefacts using scanning routines, within a +\/-1 \u00baC \ncontrolled environment. High density scan data was post-\nprocessed to produce topographical mapping of the ground \nsurfaces. \n \n3. Segment Grinding  \nGrinding performance has been demonstrated on a number \nof materials including Zerodur, ULE, fused silica and silicon \ncarbide. Zerodur and ULE are amongst the materials selected for \nuse in the prototype development phase of the E-ELT \nprogramme. Using a multi-stage grinding process, high material \nremoval rates, up to 187.5 mm\n3\n\/s, with form accuracies of +\/-1 \n\u00b5m peak to valley were achieved on spherical Zerodur and ULE \nparts of up to 1 m diameter. Surface roughness was 100-200 nm \nRMS and SSD below 10 \u00b5m [13].   \n \nThe multistage grinding process includes rough, semi-finish \nand finish stages, using D76, D46 and D25 diamond grit size \nrespectively. The resin bond wheels are formed and dressed in-\nsitu using machine integrated systems. Forming is carried out \nusing preformed electroplated diamond grit wheels, and dressing \nwith an Aluminium oxide compound. \n \nTo validate the free-form grinding capability prior to \ngrinding the E-ELT segment, an off-axes spherical part was \nground, then subsequently polished to demonstrate the ground \nsurface suitability for post-processing. The part a 350 mm \ndiameter, 60 mm thick,  2.9 m radius of curvature component, \nmounted 19.2 mm off-centre was devised to represent a \nprogramming and machine performance challenge, far exceeding \nthan that posed by specification of the E-ELT segment. The \nsurface form was measured on the CMM, figure 5 shows a \nsurface map of the ground surface. \n \n \nFigure 5 \u2013 Form departure for 2.9 m ROC sphere ground 19.2 off-centre \n \nThe total form accuracy was 4\u00b5m peak-valley for this highly \nfree-form part. The mid-spatial errors over a 20-50 mm \nwavelength were below 300 nm (Pt) in the radial orientation and \nsubstantially less circumferentially. Subsequently smoothing and \npolishing operations demonstrated the suitability of the ground \nsurface quality for final figure correction. \n \nThe hexagonal E-ELT segment selected for grinding was \none of the 984 M1 mirror segments. Each segment is to 1.45 m \nwide and 50 mm thick with a central cavity 200 mm diameter and \n36 mm depth on the underside. The selected segment lies on the \nperiphery of the M1 (mirror), see figure 6, which has an \nellipsoidal form as described by equation 1.  The segment sag is \n3 mm and departure from spherical ~150 \u00b5m, with form \nsymmetry about the X-axis. \n \n \n \n \nEquation 1 \n \n \nWhere:  \nR = 84 m   (Base radius of curvature) \nk = -0.993295  (Conic constant) \n \n \n \nFigure 6 - E-ELT Primer mirror (M1) segment array \n \nThe required form accuracy from the grinding operation was \n8 \u00b5m peak-valley, with a minimal mid spatial signature. \nSpecified reference features were the rear central cavity (x, y), \nunderside (z) and one of the hexagonal edges (rotation). \n \nThe part was procured rough ground with an 84 m radius \nspherical surface leaving 1 mm of material to be removed. The \npart was characterised on the CMM using the specified reference \nfeatures to establish a co-ordinate system. Measurements were \nthen referenced to master features on the grinding support \nsystem, see figure 8.  The initial stage of the BoX grinding \ncorrected gross form error whilst removing the SSD present from \nthe preceding aggressive rough grinding regime, typically 200-\n300 \u00b5m. Finish grind parameters were applied and a CMM \nmeasurement undertaken to confirm geometry and compensation \nalgorithms. The final grinding passes were subsequently made \nwith a D25 wheel with the error compensation algorithms \napplied. Figure 7 shows the segment undergoing grinding. \n \n \n \nFigure 7 \u2013 E-ELT Segment undergoing grinding \nFigure 8 shows the surface being measured on the CMM. \nThe same reference features were used to re-establish the co-\nordinate system and the scan data was processed to create a \nsurface map showing deviation against the surface form as \ndescribed by equation 1.  In excess of 500,000 measurement \npoints were taken to within 0.5 mm of the edges. \n \n \n \nFigure 8 - E-ELT Segment metrology \n \nThe surface map of the ground segment is shown in figure 9. The \nresults show a surface form error of RMS < 1 \u00b5m, with a P-V < \n5.5 \u00b5m, with no detectable discontinuity resulting from the cross-\nsectional variation over the central cavity region.  The segment \nthickness was held to within 3 \u00b5m of nominal specification \n(target 100 \u00b5m) with no visible edge roll-off or edge chipping as \na result of grinding. \n \n \n \nFigure 9 - Surface map of ground E-ELT segment \n \n \n4. Discussion \nBuilding on research previously carried out on 350 mm and \n1 metre parts, the grinding technology has been applied for 1.5 m \ncomponents. The high \u2018loop\u2019 stiffness of the BoX machine is \ndemonstrated by the absence of edge roll-off and chipping \u2013 \n(static loop stiffness) and sub 10 \u00b5m levels of SSD (dynamic \nloop stiffness). The multistage grinding process enables material \nremoval rates of up to 187.5 mm\n3\n\/s to be achieved, resulting in \nproduction cycle times of under 20 hours to process E-ELT 1.45 \nm segments, removing up to 1mm of material. Results show a \nRMS form error of <1 \u00b5m for an error compensated grind with \nsurface roughness of between 100-200 nm Ra \n \nThe grinding process offers lower cycle times than that \ncurrently being reported together with high accuracy and low \nlevels of SSD. With improved input quality, cycle times for \nsubsequent process stages such as computer controlled polishing \nwill be dramatically reduced. The capability therefore offers a \ncompetitive cost advantage for the large scale production \nrequired for telescope, fusion power and other large scale optics. \n \n5. Conclusion \nGrinding technology has been demonstrated for 1.45 m free-\nform Zerodur segments, with far higher fabrication rates than that \nof the currently reported state of the art. Surfaces produced have \nextremely low levels of subsurface damage < 10 \u00b5m. The \nreported capability is ideally placed to meet the future large scale \nproduction requirements for ground based telescope such as E-\nELT. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge project funding support \nthrough the UK Joint Research Councils \u2013 Basic Technologies \nprogramme and EPSRC funded Integrated Knowledge Centre for \nUltra Precision Structured Surfaces (UPS\n2\n). \n \nReferences  \n[1].
