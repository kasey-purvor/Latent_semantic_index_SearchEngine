These are: accurate parameter determination, including\nLCS information; simultaneous fitting to multiple passbands; quantitative error analysis; ob-\njective rejection of variables with non-Cepheid-like light curves or those with potential period\naliases.\nWe also use PCA to confirm that Cepheid LCSs are systematically different (at the same\nperiod) between the Milky Way and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and consider\nwhether LCS might therefore be used to estimate the mean metallicities of Cepheid samples,\nthus allowing metallicity corrections to be applied to derived distance estimates.\nKey words: Cepheids \u2013 stars: variables: other.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nMany astrophysical investigations rely on the determination of pa-\nrameters of periodic variable stars. Notably, the use of Cepheid\nvariables as distance indicators requires estimation of periods and\n(usually) intensity-mean magnitudes in order to establish a period\u2013\napparent luminosity relation. With sparse and noisy data this is hard\nto do reliably. Given the large investment of Hubble Space Tele-\nscope (HST) time in observations of Cepheids in nearby galaxies\n(e.g. Tanvir et al. 1995; Freedman et al. 2001; Saha et al. 2001), it is\nparticularly important for the techniques employed to be as accurate\nand efficient as possible.\nA number of algorithms have been developed to objectively esti-\nmate variable star parameters. Notably the \u2018string length\u2019 method of\nLafler & Kinman (1965), which essentially minimizes square mag-\nnitude differences between successive phased data points, is still\n\u0001E-mail: nrt@star.herts.ac.uk\nfrequently used to determine periods. This method works well, es-\npecially with precise and well-sampled data, but is likely to be less\nsecure with data \u2018at the limit\u2019 \u2013 i.e. close to the limiting apparent\nmagnitude of the photometry and\/or with sparse phase coverage.\nTo find intensity-mean magnitudes, many authors use the phase-\nweighted method suggested by Saha & Hoessel (1990), which makes\nallowance for the non-uniform sampling of the light curve in time.\nAgain, this works well with good data, but is potentially inefficient\n(in the sense of not making full use of all the data) with sparsely-\nsampled data.\nMost HST studies have gone one step further in using the shape\nof the light curve in the V band to predict its form in the I band, and\nhence to allow the I-band intensity-mean magnitude to be estimated\nfrom only a very few photometric data points. The motivation for\nthis approach is to provide colour information relatively cheaply,\nwhich is required to estimate \u2013 and then correct for \u2013 reddening by\ndust.\nThe simplest such recipe (Freedman 1988) uses only prior knowl-\nedge of the typical ratio of V- to I-band amplitude and the typical\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

Tanvir et al.\nphase shift between V and I bands at maximum-light for Cepheids.\nWith this model, a correction can be made to the I mean photometry,\nassuming that it is the same as the correction which would have to\nbe applied to an equivalently undersampled V light curve, multi-\nplied by the adopted ratio of amplitudes. Obviously, as with other\nsimilar methods, errors are introduced here, both those dependent\non the V and I photometric quality (or lack thereof) and possibly\nalso the accuracy of the prior information. Subsequently a rather\nmore sophisticated algorithm was developed by Labhardt, Sandage\n& Tammann (1997). This involves predicting and fitting a template\nlight-curve in the I band based on the parameters (i.e. the period,\nphase, amplitude and shape) already determined from the V-band\ndata. The strong correlations between the light curves of Cepheids\nin different bands make this a productive approach.\nFitting template light-curves as a means of estimating Cepheid pa-\nrameters was first introduced by Stetson (1996) who used templates\nbased on Fourier decomposition of a set of well-observed MW and\nLarge Magellanic Clouds (LMC)\/Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC)\nCepheids. In his method, initial values of plausible periods are de-\ntermined by string-length analysis, and then templates fitted with\neach of these periods as a starting point, and the overall amplitude\nleft as a free parameter (in addition to the period, phase and mean\nmagnitudes). A scoring system is then used to identify the most\nplausible fit. Stetson argued that the advantage of automated classi-\nfication of variables and determination of their parameters is not so\nmuch that a computer algorithm will necessarily do better than an\nexperienced human analyst, but that the biases and systematics can\nbe more easily studied and characterized.\nA further refinement to the Fourier-fitting method was presented\nin Ngeow et al. (2003), where \u2018simulated annealing\u2019 is used to im-\nprove the quality of the Fourier decomposition of sparsely sampled\nHST V-band light curves. This technique restricts the allowed range\nfor the Fourier amplitudes in the minimization procedure, and thus\nperforms substantially better than conventional least-squares fitting\non data with significant gaps in phase coverage. I-band light curves\nare reconstructed from the V band using interrelations of the Fourier\ncoefficients.\nA new approach to Cepheid light-curve template generation was\nintroduced by Tanvir, Ferguson & Shanks (1999; see also Hendry,\nTanvir & Kanbur 1999) who used Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) to statistically characterize a training set of MW, LMC and\nSMC Cepheids, and fitted these templates to V and I data for HST\nobserved Cepheids in M96. By fitting well-defined and realistic tem-\nplate curves, several parameters can be determined, together with\nestimates of their uncertainties. One of the very attractive features of\nthis technique is that photometry in different bands can be handled\nsimultaneously, so that the natural correlations between bands are\nautomatically built into the templates and all of the data is used to\ndetermine the parameters. Kanbur et al. (2002) described the PCA\nmethod in more detail, used it to investigate variation in Cepheid\nlight-curve structure as a function of period, and described the error\nproperties of the PCA coefficients. PCA template fitting was also\nsuccessfully applied to HST-observed Cepheids in NGC 1637 by\nLeonard et al. (2003).\nIn this paper we provide a complete description of the PCA-\nbased method of characterizing light curves, present an updated\ntraining set and consider in detail the subsequent template-fitting\nalgorithm which was used in Tanvir et al. (1999) and Leonard et al.\n(2003). We describe simulations which illustrate the potential of the\nmethods, and discuss future directions. Although we focus on their\napplication to V- and I-band Cepheid data, these techniques may\neasily be extended to other passbands and also used to analyse other\nclasses of periodic variable stars. For example, Kanbur & Mariani\n(2004) consider PCA of photometric data for RRab stars.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 we\npresent our training set of well-observed MW and LMC Cepheids\nand describe in more detail how PCA is applied in order to de-\nfine the template light-curves, and the advantages of this approach\nover other methods. In Section 4 we discuss an algorithm for fitting\ntemplates to noisy data in order to estimate light-curve parameters\nand their errors. Of course, such a procedure is required however\nthe templates are generated, but in our case the fitting process also\nreturns estimates for the coefficients of the first two principal com-\nponents. In Section 5 we then go on to generate simulations of poorly\nsampled Cepheids with noisy photometry, mimicking \u2018typical\u2019 and\n\u2018difficult\u2019 HST data sets, and extract their parameters by template\nfitting. We consider distance determination and light-curve parame-\nter estimation using both mean- and maximum-light estimates. This\nserves to illustrate how our method performs in practice compared\nto other methods, and also allows us to explore the limits of HST-\nlike data sets. In Section 6 we introduce an SMC Cepheid sample,\nand consider the question of whether light-curve shape (LCS), for\neither individual Cepheids or averaged over populations, contains\nother useful information \u2013 in particular its potential as an indicator\nof metallicity. Our conclusions are given in Section 7.\n2 P R I N C I PA L C O M P O N E N T A NA LY S I S\nO F O U R T R A I N I N G S E T\nPCA is a widely used statistical tool and has been applied in re-\ncent years to a number of astrophysical problems, such as spectral\nclassification, photometric redshift determination and morphologi-\ncal analysis of galaxy surveys (e.g. Li, Kong & Cheng 2001). For\na detailed account of the statistical basis of PCA the reader is re-\nferred to e.g. Morrison (1967). The central principle behind PCA\nis easily stated, however: it provides a means of transforming a\nmultidimensional data set consisting of a number of statistically de-\npendent variables into a set of statistically independent variables,\nwhich are the principal components. Specifically, the first principal\ncomponent is determined to be the linear combination of the original\nvariables which accounts for as much of the variability in the data as\npossible; the second principal component is the linear combination\nwhich accounts for as much of the remaining variability as possible \u2013\nsubject to the constraint that it is orthogonal to the first principal\ncomponent \u2013 and so on. In many situations the first few princi-\npal components may explain a high proportion of the variabil-\nity in the data, so that one may substantially reduce the number\nof variables used to describe the data set with very little loss of\ninformation.\nOur starting point is a calibrating set of 127 Cepheids, with pe-\nriods P > 10 d and high-quality well-sampled V- and I-band light\ncurves. We used this \u2018training set\u2019 to establish relationships be-\ntween multicolour LCS and period. The training set consists of the\nfollowing.\n(i) 61 Galactic Cepheids with photometry from Berdnikov (un-\npublished data base), Berdnikov & Turner (1995) and Moffett &\nBarnes (1984).\n(ii) 66 LMC Cepheids, covering a wider period range with pho-\ntometry primarily from the OGLE catalogue of Classical Cepheids\n(Udalski et al. 1999a; web archive at http:\/\/bulge.princeton.edu\/\n\u223cogle\/ogle2\/cep lmc.html; Fourier analysis from Ngeow et al.\n2003), but supplemented by data taken from various sources, par-\nticularly Moffett et al. (1998).\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

Distribution of log period for our \u2018training set\u2019 of 127 Cepheids.\nFig. 1 shows the distribution of periods in our sample. Note that\nwe do not include any SMC Cepheids in our training set; this reflects\nthe fact that the metallicity of target galaxies for e.g. HST Cepheid\ndistance estimation is generally significantly higher than that of the\nSMC. We do consider SMC Cepheids in Section 6, however, in our\ndiscussion of LCS characterized by PCA as a possible diagnostic of\nmetallicity.\nTo apply PCA to this sample, we first Fourier analyse the pho-\ntometric data (for those variables not already analysed by Ngeow\net al.), up to eighth order, i.e. perform a least-squares fit of the\nfollowing:\nm(t) = m0 +\nk=8\u2211\nk=1\nak sin(2\u03c0kt\/P) + bk cos(2\u03c0kt\/P). (1)\nThe coefficients of the Fourier terms constitute a vector consisting\nof 32 elements for each member of the training set (i.e. eight sine\namplitudes and eight cosine amplitudes for both the V and I bands \u2013\nbut note that the phase is shifted such that the first cosine term in\nV is always zero). Note also that the mean V and I magnitudes, the\na0 terms, of the calibrating Cepheids are not included in the PCA\nbecause they are distance dependent).\nThe mean V and I LCS is established simply by averaging these\nvectors. PCA is then applied to the whole set of residual vectors (i.e.\nwith the average vector subtracted) in order to determine the most\nsignificant variations from the mean LCS. Full numerical details of\nthe analysis are given in Appendix A. Incorporating both V and I data\nin each vector means that the correlations between the coefficients\nin each band are automatically encoded in the resulting analysis.\nThis could, of course, be extended to more bands, but we restrict\nourselves to V and I here because only those filters have been used\nin the large majority of HST studies.\nIn practice, the first principal component largely reflects simple\nvariations in amplitude. Subsequent components encode more sub-\ntle LCS information, such as \u2018bumps\u2019. Of course, sets of Fourier\namplitudes are not the only vectors which could be used as input to\nthe PCA. One could, for example, work directly with the observed\nV and I magnitudes for each calibrator, smoothed and interpolated\non to a regular grid of phase values. We find, however, that the use\nof Fourier components as input vectors works very well, naturally\nincorporating a degree of smoothing of the input data and providing\na link with previous approaches to LCS analysis.\nTable 1 shows for our calibrating set the proportion of the variance\nexplained by the first few principal components. We can see from\nthis table that one requires only a few components to explain a\nTable 1. Proportion of the total variance in the calibrating\nset explained by the first few principal components. (In PCA\nthe variance associated with each component is equal to the\ncorresponding eigenvalue of the covariance matrix).\nComponent Normalized variance Cumulative variance\n1 0.627 0.627\n2 0.199 0.827\n3 0.064 0.890\n4 0.026 0.917\nlarge proportion: for example, the first three principal components\naccount for 89 per cent of the variance of LCS within the sample.\nMoreover, because the observed scatter in the data includes the\neffects of photometric errors and finite sampling on the estimated\nFourier coefficients which are input to the PCA, the proportion of\nthe intrinsic variation in LCS explained by the first three principal\ncomponents will, in fact, be even higher than 89 per cent.\nFig. 2 shows an example of two Cepheids from the OGLE data set\nwith very good phase coverage. This illustrates that excellent light\ncurves are reconstructed from just two PCA terms. As these recon-\nstructed curves incorporate information from the whole training set,\nthey necessarily reflect average Cepheid behaviour, and do not fit\nperfectly any individual Cepheid. However, this has the advantage\nthat they do not follow noise in the data either, as the Fourier fits in\nthe V band are beginning to do in these examples.\n3 D E R I V I N G T E M P L AT E L I G H T- C U RV E S\nWith the PCA coefficients for each variable in hand, we can plot\nthem as a function of period, as shown for the first four principal\ncomponents in Fig. 3. This figure reveals some important trends \u2013\nnotably that the behaviour of the first principal component, as ex-\npected, is similar to a simple plot of amplitude versus period, with a\npeak at around P = 30 d (see e.g. Schaltenbrand & Tammann 1972).\nThere is clearly also systematic structure in the plots for the coeffi-\ncients of the second and third principal components. By the fourth\ncomponent the distribution of coefficients is becoming increasingly\ndominated by noise, although small but statistically significant cor-\nrelations of the coefficients with log (P) are seen up to at least eight\nPCA terms.\nWe have fitted low-order polynomials through these scatter plots,\nto define \u2018typical\u2019 values of the PCA coefficients for a Cepheid of\ngiven period, and also obtain some estimate of the spread around\nthese typical values. The polynomial fits are shown by the solid\ncurves in each of the panels of Fig. 3, terminating at log(P\/days) =\n1.8 where the number of training Cepheids becomes very few.\nBefore discussing the construction of template light-curves, it is\ninteresting to compare the distribution of coefficients for the Milky\nWay (MW) and LMC subsamples. For the first and third principal\ncomponents we can see from Fig. 3 that the distributions appear to be\nwell mixed, with no obvious distinction between the two samples.\nThis is broadly consistent with the results of Kanbur & Ngeow\n(2004), who obtained period\u2013colour and amplitude\u2013colour relations\nfor a similar sample of MW and LMC OGLE Cepheids. While\nthose authors found strong evidence for a difference in the slope\nof these relations between long- (i.e. P > 10 d) and short-period\nCepheids, they did not find a statistically significant difference in\nthe long-period sample slopes between the LMC and MW. For the\nsecond principal component, on the other hand, at a given period\nthe LMC coefficients typically appear to be less than those for the\nMW. The distributions are clearly not disjoint, so that the adoption\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

Light-curves for two LMC Cepheids of different periods (OGLE data). The Fourier fits are shown as a grey line (i.e. 32 terms describing both V\nand I), and the reconstructed PCA curves with one, two, three and four terms are shown in successively thicker, black lines. We emphasize that V and I are\nsimultaneously described by the PCA curves because the analysis is performed on the combined data set. Note that the fits, whilst not perfect, are very good,\nand that in fact beyond two terms further changes in the PCA curves are almost entirely within the thickness of the line.\nof a single polynomial fit to describe the structure in the combined\ntraining set is reasonable. Nevertheless, Fig. 3 suggests that the\nsecond principal component, at least, might be a useful discriminator\nbetween different Cepheid samples. We discuss this point further in\nSection 6 below.\nIn order to generate a realistic Cepheid light-curve template all\nthat is now required is to read off the PCA coefficients correspond-\ning to the desired period according to the polynomial fits in Fig. 3,\nand hence, with knowledge of the PCA vectors and the average light\ncurves, reconstruct a full sequence of Fourier terms. We emphasize\nagain that because V and I Fourier coefficients are both included\nin each vector, the light curves in each band are reconstructed si-\nmultaneously. An extra degree of sophistication can be achieved by\nconsidering the PCA coefficients within a range around the polyno-\nmial fit corresponding to the scatter in the training set. In this case\nwe find not a single template at a given period, but a whole family\nof allowable light curves.\nRecalling that the primary motivation of the present study is to\nextract optimal light-curve parameters from observed noisy data\nsets, the next challenge is to find the best-fitting template light-\ncurves to such a data set when the period and other parameters are\na priori unknown. Our solution to this problem is described in more\ndetail in the next section.\n4 L I G H T- C U RV E PA R A M E T E R E S T I M AT I O N\nV I A T E M P L AT E F I T T I N G\nTo characterize the Cepheid light-curves of sparsely sampled, noisy\ndata our approach is to find the best-fitting PCA templates, simul-\ntaneously in V and I, determined from a search of the plausible\nparameter space in period, V and I mean magnitude, phase and\nPCA coefficients. Determining period, phase etc. using both bands\nis unusual, but makes most efficient use of all the data.\nIn practice \u2013 mainly for computational expediency \u2013 only the\nfirst two PCA coefficients are allowed to vary. The higher PCA co-\nefficients are set to zero, but as seen already Fig. 2), using more\nthan two PCA terms only modifies the light curves at a subtle\nlevel.\nThe fitting procedure for an individual Cepheid is summarized as\nfollows.\n(i) Loop over a large range of trial periods (usually between 10\nand 65 d with steps of 0.001 in the log).\n(ii) For each trial period, loop over a range of PC1 and PC2 coef-\nficients around their typical values for that period, thus generating\ntemplate light-curves in V and I for each pair of values of the PC1\nand PC2 coefficients.\n(iii) For each pair of templates, find the values of phase and\nintensity-mean magnitudes in V and I which minimize the \u03c7 2 statis-\ntic, where \u03c7 2 is defined as the sum of the squared deviations (nor-\nmalized by the photometric errors) between the observed V and I\ndata points and the magnitudes predicted by the templates. This\nprocedure utilizes the Amoeba algorithm (e.g. Press et al. 1992).\n(iv) Move to next pair of PC1 and PC2 coefficients.\n(v) Move to next trial period.\nAt the end of this process, the trial period and V and I light curves\nwith the overall lowest \u03c7 2 is then assumed to provide the best esti-\nmates of all the parameters.\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

PCA coefficients plotted as a function of log period in days, for our training set of 127 MW (light stars) and LMC Cepheids (darker squares). The\nfour panels illustrate the diminishing strength of successive principal components, and by plotting against log (P) also reveal the systematic trends in light-curve\namplitude and shape with period. Low-order polynomial fits are overplotted which will be used to obtain typical coefficients at a given period. The small but\nreal difference between the distributions of LMC and MW points is discussed further in the text.\nIn practice we plot exp (\u2212\u03c72 red\/2), as an indicator of relative\nlikelihood, against test period. This plot reveals: first, the best period\n(the peak position); secondly, the goodness of the best fit (the height\nof the peak); thirdly, how well the period is determined (the width\nof the peak); and, fourthly, whether there are any potential aliases\nat completely different periods (essentially the height of the second\nhighest peak). As we show later, this information can be very useful\nin deciding objectively which variables to include and which to\nexclude in a period\u2013luminosity (PL) analysis.\n4.1 Estimating the distance modulus and its error\nTo estimate the distance modulus of the Cepheid we now ignore the\ndata points and calculate intensity-mean magnitudes, \u3008V \u3009, \u3008I \u3009, of\nthe fitted templates themselves. These are compared to the absolute\nmagnitudes calculated for the given period using the calibrating\nPL relations. The colour excess is used to correct for extinction\nfollowing the procedure detailed by Tanvir (1997), and hence an\nestimate of the true, unreddened distance modulus, \u00b50, is made.\nWe can also obtain in a straightforward manner an estimate\nof the uncertainty on \u00b50 by computing the posterior distribution,\np(\u00b50 | data), of \u00b50 given the observed V- and I-band data. Note that\nthis procedure accounts for internal errors due to photometric noise\nand finite sampling, but not to errors in the original templates (likely\nto be relatively small in practice) or calibration errors (which must\nbe estimated independently).\nWe proceed as follows. Let \u03c6, P , PC1, PC2 denote respectively\nthe phase constant, period and the first and second PCA compo-\nnents of the underlying light curves. Ignoring the higher order PCA\ncoefficients, and also neglecting for the moment the impact on the\nLCS of other stellar parameters such as metallicity (see below), we\nassume that these four parameters, together with the intensity-mean\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

Note, moreover, that under this approximation P is uniquely\ndefined by the values of \u3008V \u3009, \u3008I \u3009 and \u00b50, so that we need not con-\nsider the period as an independent parameter.1 To simplify notation,\nwe denote the remaining light-curve parameters collectively by the\ncolumn vector \u039b; i.e.\n\u039b \u2261 (\u3008V \u3009, \u3008I \u3009, \u03c6, PC1, PC2)T .

From Bayes\u2019 theorem we may write\np(\u00b50,\u039b | data) = p(data | \u00b50,\u039b)p(\u00b50,\u039b), (5)\nwhere the first term is the likelihood function, expressing the prob-\nability of obtaining the observed photometric data, given a set of\nlight-curve parameters and a Cepheid at distance modulus \u00b50, and\nthe second term is a prior distribution for those parameters and for the\ndistance modulus. Assuming a flat prior for p(\u00b50, \u039b), equation (4)\nmay be further reduced to\np(\u00b50 | data) \u221d\n\u2211\nj\n\u2211\nk\np(data | \u00b50, \u3008V \u3009 j , \u3008I \u3009k, \u03c6, PC1, PC2) (6)\nwhere \u3008V \u3009 j and \u3008I \u3009k denote a series of (equally spaced) trial values\nof the mean V- and I-band magnitudes. One can, if appropriate,\neasily generalize equation (6) to the case of a non-uniform prior and\na non-uniform grid of \u3008V \u3009 j and \u3008I \u3009k values.\nAssuming that the photometric errors are normally distributed,\nfinally we obtain\np(\u00b50 | data) \u221d\n\u2211\nj\n\u2211\nk\nexp\n(\u2212 \u03c7 2jk), (7)\nwhere \u03c7 2jk is the chi-squared obtained from comparing the observed\nand predicted magnitudes, given values of \u00b5, \u3008V \u3009 j , \u3008I \u3009k , \u03c6, PC1 and\nPC2. In fact, we could take as our estimate of \u00b50 the value which\nmaximizes the posterior likelihood p(\u00b50 | data) \u2013 or equivalently the\nvalue which minimizes \u03c72jk \u2013 however, in practice these values differ\nfrom those for the individual best-fitting template by only one or two\nhundredths of a magnitude in distance modulus. Instead we use the\nfact that p(\u00b50 | data) should be properly normalized, to compute\n\u03c3 \u00b5, the uncertainty in the estimated distance modulus from the\nwidth of the resulting likelihood function. Notice that this analysis\ngives reasonable estimates of the uncertainty providing the estimated\nperiod itself is not greatly in error. If, in fact, the best-fitting period\nis an alias then the true error on the distance modulus is likely to be\nsignificantly larger.\n1 In other words we assume that the Cepheid lies exactly on the fiducial V\nand I linear PL relations.\nThe above analysis can be readily extended to include a metal-\nlicity dependence in the shape of the light-curve templates and in\nthe PL relations. In this case the period, P, would be determined\nby the values of \u00b5, \u3008V \u3009, \u3008I \u3009 and metallicity, Z, which itself might\nbe estimated along with the other independent parameters by the\ntemplate-fitting approach. Such an extension in practice seemed in-\nappropriate for the training set considered in this paper, because\nit contained Cepheids from different metallicity environments (but\nsee Section 6, below). The study of metallicity effects using PCA\nis straightforward in principle, however, (see Kanbur et al. 2002).\nMoreover, one could extend the model for the prior distribution,\np(\u00b50, \u039b), of light-curve parameters to include a dependence on\nother fundamental stellar parameters, such as effective temperature\nand mass, reflecting one\u2019s state of knowledge about, for example,\nthe width of the instability strip, initial mass function and mass lu-\nminosity relation for Cepheids (see, for example, Kochanek (1997)\nfor an example of such a prior model).\n5 S I M U L AT I O N S O F S PA R S E A N D N O I S Y\nL I G H T C U RV E S\nAnother use of our template light-curves is to provide the underly-\ning models for production of artificial Cepheid photometry. In this\nsection we describe simulations designed to resemble the sparse\nand noisy photometry from typical HST Cepheid monitoring cam-\npaigns. We then run the PCA template-fitting program on these data\nsets to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters for\neach simulated Cepheid, and hence establish how accurately the in-\nput parameters are recovered. We also compare the template-fitting\nresults to those obtained from more traditional parameter estima-\ntion methods. Although the simulations are realistic, they are not\ndesigned to replicate specific cases of HST-observed Cepheids in\nexternal galaxies but rather to represent generic examples similar\nto those found by most HST studies. Moreover, we have not com-\npared our template-fitting method with all algorithms which have\nbeen used to determine Cepheid light-curve parameters \u2013 partly be-\ncause many such studies have involved some degree of subjectivity,\nfor example in selecting the Cepheids themselves, which is hard to\nreplicate.\nWe chose to simulate data for Cepheids of log(P\/days) = 1.4\n(about 25 d), being typical of the variables observed in the HST pro-\ngrams, and in the middle of the range for which the sampling strategy\nis optimized. Phases were random, and PCA coefficients chosen to\nbe as those for real Cepheids (i.e. based on the polynomial fit to\nthe training set) at the period in question. The sampling of the light\ncurves was carried out using a particular sequence of observations\nbased on that adopted by the HST H0 Key-Project group Specif-\nically this meant 12 epochs of observation in V and four epochs\nin I. Realistic, magnitude-dependent photometric noise was added\nto the data points, with one set of 400 simulations with error bars\non each point around 0.1\u20130.2 mag, being representative of \u2018typical\u2019\nHST data, and another set of 1000 simulations representing \u2018dif-\nficult\u2019, low signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratio data with error bars more\nlike 0.15\u20130.3 mag per data point. The latter set approximates the\nworst-case data which have been obtained in some HST studies.\n5.1 Results of simulations\nTo provide a benchmark we first analysed each simulated data set\nwith the methods of period finding via string-length minimization\n(Lafler & Kinman 1965) and phase-weighted intensity-mean mag-\nnitude estimation (Saha & Hoessel 1990).

As the input period\nis log(P\/days) = 1.4, the method obviously works well for this simulation.\nThe worst aliases tend to occur at half the true period (i.e. offset by about\n0.3 in the log), but in this case (and in fact for nearly all the simulations with\nthis S\/N ratio) the worst alias is not as good a fit as is the correct period.\nThe right-hand panels show the data points folded on this best period. Note\nthat the zero points for the magnitude scales are chosen arbitrarily.\nsame synthetic data using our PCA template approach described\nabove. For the sake of brevity we henceforth refer to these as the\n\u2018OLD\u2019 and \u2018NEW\u2019 algorithms respectively, whilst clearly recogniz-\ning these particular OLD methods are by no means the only ones\nused in previous studies. They do, however, have the benefit of being\neasily and mechanically applied to the data.\nWe consider first the simulations of \u2018typical\u2019, moderate S\/N ra-\ntio data. Examples of the simulations and period determination are\ngiven in Fig. 4 for the OLD algorithms, and Fig. 5 for the PCA\ntemplate-fitting algorithm. Both approaches work well in this ex-\nample, in the sense of correctly identifying the period. The fact that\nsubtle LCS information is largely erased by this degree of sparse\nFigure 5. The same simulated data shown in Fig. 4 analysed with the\nNEW, template-fitting algorithm. In this case we look for a peak in the\nrelative likelihood curve (left-hand panel) to identify the best fitting period\n(see description in text). The period found by the algorithm is very close to\nthat input in the simulation, log(P\/days) = 1.4, and again a small alias is\nseen to appear near P\/2. The right-hand panels again show the data folded\non this best period.\nsampling and noise addition means that the use of the same tem-\nplates for both creating and fitting to the simulated data should\nnot significantly bias the results. We checked this expectation by\nrunning further noisy simulations but this time starting with the\nobserved light curves of individual Cepheids from the training set\nwhich were outliers from the curves in Fig. 3. The results and level\nof improvement with template fitting were qualitatively similar to\nthose reported above, with the proviso that both algorithms (espe-\ncially the OLD ones) do somewhat better when the overall Cepheid\namplitude is larger rather than smaller. In other words, as one would\nexpect, the outliers with PC1 above the average are easier to find\nperiods for than the outliers with PC1 below the average.\nIn Fig. 6 we summarize the results of all 400 simulations in his-\ntograms showing the returned periods and inferred distance moduli.\nThe extinction-corrected distance moduli are calculated using P ,\n\u3008V \u3009 and \u3008I\u3009 as described by Tanvir (1997), which is essentially the\nsame method as used by the HST H0 Key-Project group. Neither\nmethod is confused by aliases with this S\/N ratio data, although the\ntemplate fitting produces rather more accurate periods and distance\nmoduli. Specifically the 1\u03c3 rms scatters for the NEW and OLD\nmethods are 0.16 and 0.23 mag respectively, suggesting that the un-\ncertainties in distance modulus resulting from light-curve parameter\nestimation for samples of several tens of Cepheids should only be a\nfew hundredths of a magnitude.\nFor each fit to the simulated data sets we also evaluated the uncer-\ntainty in distance modulus as described in Section 4.1. The average\nturned out to be 0.15 mag, very close to the observed scatter, giving\nconfidence that the errors returned by the template-fitting procedure\nitself are realistic.\nFigure 6. Histograms of the results from 400 simulations with \u2018typical\u2019 HST\nS\/N ratio. The input values are indicated by vertical dotted lines, namely\nlog(P\/days) = 1.4 and \u00b50 = 30. The latter is chosen arbitrarily as being\ntypical of HST studied galaxies. The upper panels are for template fitting\nand the lower panels using the OLD algorithms. Both period and distance\nmodulus are well determined with this S\/N ratio, as indicated by the solid dot\nand bar which represent the mean and standard deviation of each distribution\n(numerical values are printed next to the bar). The number of occasions where\nan alias period is wrongly identified as the true period is negligible.\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

Examples of \u2018difficult\u2019, low S\/N ratio simulated data analysed with the OLD algorithms. The panels are similar to those in Fig. 4. The four cases\nwere chosen to illustrate a range in behaviour, with the top left and bottom right variables suffering from bad aliases at half the true period. Note, in the latter\ncase the folded data points do not trace a very Cepheid-like light curve.\nThe situation with the \u2018difficult\u2019, low S\/N ratio data is illustrated\nin Fig. 7 for the OLD algorithms and Fig. 8 for the NEW template-\nfitting ones. In this case we show four examples to highlight the fact\nthat now results range from cases where the input parameters are\nwell recovered, to instances where the best fit is actually obtained\nwith an alias period.\nThis behaviour is summarized in Fig. 9 for 1000 simulated data\nsets which shows that now both techniques produce the occasional\nperiod aliases. In general terms the periods and distance moduli show\nmore scatter than was the case with higher S\/N ratio, although over-\nall an accuracy of about 0.4 mag per Cepheid in distance modulus\nis still reasonably good. Once again the template-fitting performs a\nlittle better than the OLD algorithms, but both reveal a slight bias\nto lower distance moduli, over and above the increased scatter.\nHowever, we must be cautious in interpreting these results for a\nnumber of reasons. In practice, because of the low S\/N ratio, some\nof our simulated variables would probably not have been classified\nas variables in the first place had they appeared in an HST study.\nFurthermore, bad fits would often be rejected as not being suffi-\nciently \u2018Cepheid-like\u2019. It would not be surprising if such cases of\nbad template fits also produced the most discrepant distance moduli.\nIn order to assess these effects, and also make the test more realis-\ntic, we clipped the sample of simulations to exclude those for which\nthe degree of scatter of the data points about a constant, non-variable\nline was such that it would only occur by chance 1 time in 5000.\nIn other words we insisted (as do most Cepheid studies one way or\nanother), that the threshold for treating a star as a variable is high\nenough that very few non-variable stars ever exceed it by chance.\nFurther we set an upper limit to the acceptable reduced \u03c7 2 red for the\ntemplate fit of 1.3, which means that 22 per cent of true Cepheids\nwill be lost, but ensures that only those which fold to produce gen-\nuine \u2018Cepheid-like\u2019 light curves are retained. Finally, we rejected\nany variables for which there was an alias period with a \u03c7 2 red < 1.5\nwhich was separated by less than 0.1 in log(P) from the highest like-\nlihood peak. This procedure loses a few fits which produced accurate\nperiods, but is particularly good at removing probable aliases.\nThe results of this whole clipping procedure are shown in Fig. 10.\nAs expected, the scatter in the results of both methods is reduced,\nbut in particular problems with aliases for the template fitting are\nlargely removed, as is the bias in distance modulus determination.\nViewed as a whole the simulations permit the following conclu-\nsions.\n(i) Template fitting results in a roughly 30 per cent reduction in\nscatter in estimates of distance modulus for the \u2018typical\u2019 S\/N ratio\ndata compared to the OLD methods of string-length minimization to\ndetermine periods and phase-weighted averaging to obtain intensity-\nmean magnitudes.\n(ii) There is a tendency to slightly underestimate periods for\n\u2018difficult\u2019, low S\/N ratio data. Again template fitting does somewhat\nbetter than string length. This small bias in period also leads to a\nsmall bias in distance modulus. In fact, we have also performed sim-\nulations for longer period log(P) = 1.7 Cepheids (i.e. around 50 d),\nalthough not reported here in detail, and find this underestimation\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

The same simulated data as Fig. 7 analysed with the NEW, template-fitting algorithms. Again the top left case hits the same problem with an alias\nperiod providing a better fit that the true period. However, in the bottom-right case this time, the fact that we are fitting a template rather than simply minimizing\nstring-length has correctly identified the period.\nFigure 9. Histograms of the results from 1000 simulations of \u2018difficult\u2019, low\nS\/N data. Compared to Fig. 6 we see that the distribution of returned periods\nand inferred distance moduli shows more scatter, a small but non-negligible\ncontamination by aliased periods and a small but statistically significant bias\ntoward lower values of \u00b50.\nbecomes a little worse. This is not surprising because the period is\nnow approaching the total length of the observing sequence, and is\nonly a little below the maximum period employed in the trials.\n(iii) Both approaches perform respectably even for low S\/N ratio\ndata, but with a increasing incidence of period aliases. However, not\nonly does the template fitting do somewhat better, it also computes a\ngoodness-of-fit (\u03c72) for the template fit, providing an objective way\nof selecting the variables for inclusion in the analysis. A sample\nculled on the basis of only including good template fits reduces the\nscatter by a factor of around 2 compared to the traditional OLD\nmethods.\n(iv) The distance modulus uncertainties calculated as described\nin Section 4.1 are on average very good. For example, for the\n25-day period simulations the average uncertainty calculated for\nthe typical S\/N case was 0.15 mag compared to the actual disper-\nsion around the true (input) value of 0.16 mag. For the low S\/N ratio\ndata the numbers are 0.28 mag for the estimated errors compared to\n0.31 mag as the dispersion for the clipped sample of simulations.\nWhile these are interesting results, and establish the utility of the\nPCA template-fitting method, we caution that they do not imply sig-\nnificant problems with the results obtained by the various groups re-\nporting HST Cepheid observations in the past. For one thing, for the\ntypical S\/N ratio photometry, the NEW algorithm only performed\na little better than the OLD ones. Furthermore, most recent studies\nhave not simply adopted the OLD methods considered above, but\nhave also either applied \u2018chi-by-eye\u2019 rejection of doubtful variables,\nand\/or performed other variants on the template-fitting scheme.

This\nprocess mimics what is often done in practice, selecting candidates above\nsome threshold criterion for variability, and rejecting those which do not\nappear \u2018Cepheid-like\u2019. In addition, as described in the text, we have removed\nvariables with potential aliases, which is a fairly well-defined, automated\nprocedure (i.e. based on the height of the second highest peak in the relative\nlikelihood plot for the variable) when doing template fitting. These steps\nobviously reduce scatter, remove many of the aliases, particularly for the\ntemplate-fitting, and largely remove the small bias. The price which is paid\nis the loss of 12.5 per cent of the variables used for the OLD algorithm\nanalysis, and about 46 per cent of the variables used for the template fitting.\nresults of our simulations reinforce the conclusion that such tem-\nplate fitting has many benefits, but we have also shown that our\nprocedure has a more rigorous statistical basis and provides a more\nefficient means of encoding relevant LCS information than previous\nmethods.\n5.2 Estimating maximum light from template fits\nVarious authors have suggested that Cepheids at maximum light\nmay be as good, if not better, standard candles than Cepheids at\nintensity mean-light (e.g. Sandage & Tammann 1968; Kanbur &\nHendry 1996; Kanbur et al. 2003). Aside from arguments based\non intrinsic physical properties, another advantage could be that\nmaximum light may be more precisely determined than mean light\nif the Cepheid is faint and hence poorly observed through minimum.\nHowever, maximum-light has rarely been used in practice, per-\nhaps partly because many epochs are required to give a decent\nchance of sampling close to the maximum. One also loses some\nof the benefit of averaging many observations to reduce noise. Ob-\ntaining estimates of maximum-light from template fits may be a\nway of benefiting from the advantages while not suffering the dis-\nadvantages. All the data is used, with appropriate weighting, and\nreasonable estimates of maximum-light can be obtained without\nrequiring dense sampling over the maximum itself.\nWe have also tested our ability to estimate maximum-light us-\ning the template fits to the simulated data. The resulting histograms\nare actually so similar to the ones presented for mean-light that\nwe feel they are not worth showing separately (mean-light is very\nmarginally better). Admittedly here the fact that the same templates\nare used to create the artificial noisy data in the first place and then\nto fit to it, may make the simulation results appear slightly rosier\nthan reality. But the point is clear: although we find no evidence that\nmaximum-light is superior to mean-light, it is certainly reasonable\nto use maximum-light with template fitting. Interestingly we also\nfind a strong correlation between the maximum-light and mean-light\ndistance moduli for individual simulated Cepheids, indicating, per-\nhaps unsurprisingly, that they encode very similar information and\ncan not therefore be combined in any way to provide an improved\ndistance indicator.\n6 L I G H T- C U RV E S H A P E A N D M E TA L L I C I T Y\nAn obvious question which arises from our analysis thus far is\nwhether LCS is sensitive to physical parameters other than just\nperiod. It would be particularly useful, for example, if LCS were\nfound to be sensitive to a property \u2013 such as metallicity \u2013 which\nis expected to correlate with the absolute magnitude of a Cepheid\n(see e.g. Caputo et al. 2000, and references therein). Quantifying the\n(reddening corrected) sensitivity of Cepheid distances to metallicity\nhas proven hard, but estimates have tended to be in the region of\n0.2 mag in distance modulus (\u223c10 per cent in distance) for a fac-\ntor 10 in metallicity (e.g. Sakai et al. 2004). In most HST studies,\nthe Cepheid metallicity is estimated from spectroscopy of the gas\nphase \u2013 sometimes from nebulae in other parts of the galaxy from the\nCepheids. Directly constraining the metallicity of the Cepheid sam-\nple itself via observations of LCS would have obvious advantages\nover this approach.\nIn fact, Paczynski & Pindor (2000) already pointed out that OGLE\nobserved Cepheids in the SMC have systematically lower ampli-\ntudes than those in the LMC in the period range 1.1 < log(P) <\n1.4, which they suggest is likely to be a metallicity effect. Simi-\nlarly, Kanbur et al. (2002) presented evidence suggesting a differ-\nence in the average LCS of SMC and LMC first-overtone Cepheids,\nbased on a principal component analysis of densely sampled V and\nI Cepheid light-curves from the OGLE (Udalski et al. 1999a,b)\nand EROS (Beaulieu et al. 1995) microlensing surveys. Fig. 12 of\nKanbur et al. shows, as a function of period, the coefficients of\nthe first and second principal components for OGLE first-overtone\nCepheids with periods less than 10 d. A comparison from that fig-\nure of the PCA coefficient distribution for LMC and SMC Cepheids\nshows some clear differences \u2013 most notably that the distribution of\nfirst principal component coefficients for the SMC Cepheids gener-\nally lies below that for the LMC Cepheids. Hence the PCA approach\npicks out changes in the structure of overtone light curves which\ncorrelate with metallicity.\nFig. 11 shows the distribution, as a function of log period, of\nthe first four principal component coefficients of the same MW and\nLMC Cepheids as Fig. 3 together with a further 52 Cepheids from\nthe SMC. The data for the latter are largely from the OGLE data base\n(Udalski et al. 1999b) and Moffett et al. (1998). Note that the SMC\nlight curves have been decomposed on to the PCA basis established\nfrom the MW\/LMC data rather than being included in an expanded\ntraining set.\nAddition of the SMC data clearly increases the spread at a\ngiven period, but most of this appears to be systematic rather than\nincreased random scatter. In particular, the PC1 coefficients are\ngenerally lower than those of the MW and LMC, confirming\nthe reduced amplitude noted by Paczynski & Pindor (2000).\nParticularly prominent are a group of five SMC Cepheids with\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

PCA coefficients plotted as a function of log period, for our training set of MW (light stars), LMC (darker squares), extended by the addition of a\nsample of SMC (dark triangles) Cepheids. The PCA basis used is that of Fig. 3 (i.e. the SMC data have been decomposed on to this basis). Separate low-order\npolynomial fits are shown for each set of points, illustrating the systematic differences in LCS from galaxy to galaxy, presumably due to metallicity differences.\nThe large error bars show the spread in derived PCA coefficients expected from template fitting to \u2018typical\u2019 noisy data, as estimated from our simulations. This\nindicates that photometry for individual HST-observed Cepheids will not usually be good enough to quantify metallicity, but averaging together a reasonable\nsample for a particular galaxy might be.\nlog(P\/days) \u223c 1.5, although these Cepheids are not significant out-\nliers in the PC2 coefficient distribution.\nFor the PC2 coefficients, the SMC points are again generally\nlower, as is most clearly seen by looking at the separate polynomial\nfits for each galaxy. Of course, given our particular focus on HST\nCepheid studies, our training set consists only of fundamental mode\nCepheids with period, P > 10 d. Thus Fig. 11 is not directly compa-\nrable to fig. 12 of Kanbur et al. (2002). Unlike the plots we presented\nfor the MW and LMC alone (Fig. 3) we now also see that PC3 and\nPC4 coefficients for the SMC tend to follow the upper envelopes of\ndistributions.\nThe metallicities of LMC and SMC Cepheids are thought to\nbe about 50 and 20 per cent of the MW Cepheids, respectively.\nIf we assume that the observed differences in PCA coefficients are\ndue to metallicity then it may provide a route to estimating the\naverage metallicities of other samples of Cepheids directly. The\nfeasibility of this is indicated by the bold vertical bars in the top\npanels of Fig. 11. These show, at three different values of log P, the\n1\u03c3 spread in returned PC1 and PC2 coefficients for the simulated\n\u2018typical S\/N\u2019 data. (Given the typical V- and I-band sampling of\nHST Cepheid observations, it would be unrealistic to extract reliable\nLCS information from the third, or higher, principal components.)\nIt is apparent that for individual Cepheids only very weak con-\nstraints can be placed with this quality of data. However, with better\ndata or by averaging a reasonable sample of Cepheids, a useful, di-\nrect diagnostic of metallicity may well be achievable. We intend to\nC\u00a9 2005 The Authors.

We have also described how light-curve parameters can\nbe extracted by fitting these templates to sparse and noisy data, and\nillustrated the method with extensive simulations.\nThe advantages of this approach are (i) very realistic light curves\nas a (smooth) function of period are obtained with only one or two\nprincipal components \u2013 in fact they are frequently better than the full\nFourier fits to the calibrating data because averaging over the full set\nof Cepheids removes some numerical noise; (ii) multicolour data can\nbe accommodated with a single combined fit which automatically\naccounts for the correlations between bands; (iii) template fitting\nto all data (weighted by the errors on each measurement) makes\noptimal use of the information in determining light-curve parame-\nters; (iv) variables with poor fits (which might be produced by non-\nCepheids or those whose photometry is badly affected by crowding)\nand potential period aliases are easily identified, and hence can be re-\nmoved from consideration by applying objective, statistical criteria\n(rather than, for example, by visual inspection, as has often been the\ncase in the past); (v) errors can be estimated in a moderately rigorous\nway, and Cepheids can be selected on the basis of goodness-of-fit;\nand (vi) maximum-light is straight forward to estimate and can be\nused as an alternative to mean-light in the PL relation.\nThe simulations themselves show that most Cepheids observed in\nHST campaigns should individually give distance moduli to about\n0.2 mag (with the template fitting doing somewhat better than less\nsophisticated approaches), indicating that for typical sample sizes\n(several tens of variables), random errors in the derived Cepheid\nparameters should only be at the few per cent level for the sample as\na whole, and systematics are likely to be the dominant source of un-\ncertainty. Interestingly we have found that even with very poor S\/N\nratio data, errors can be as little as 0.3 mag for individual Cepheids\nusing template fitting.\nFinally we note that these methods can easily be extended to\nphotometry in more than two bands, and to the analysis of other\nkinds of periodic variable stars.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThis work made use of the McMaster Cepheid Database, maintained\nby Doug Welch.\nR E F E R E N C E S\nBeaulieu J.
