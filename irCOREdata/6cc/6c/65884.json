Troffaes\nCarnegie Mellon University, Department of Philosophy, Baker Hall 135,\nPittsburgh, PA 15213, US\nAbstract\nVarious ways for decision making with imprecise probabilities\u2014admissibility, max-\nimal expected utility, maximality, E-admissibility, \u0393-maximax, \u0393-maximin, all of\nwhich are well-known from the literature\u2014are discussed and compared. We gener-\nalize a well-known sufficient condition for existence of optimal decisions. A simple\nnumerical example shows how these criteria can work in practice, and demonstrates\ntheir differences. Finally, we suggest an efficient approach to calculate optimal de-\ncisions under these decision criteria.\nKey words: decision, optimality, uncertainty, probability, maximality,\nE-admissibility, maximin, lower prevision\n1 Introduction\nOften, we find ourselves in a situation where we have to make some decision d,\nwhich we may freely choose from a set D of available decisions. Usually, we do not\nchoose d arbitrarily in D: indeed, we wish to make a decision that performs best\naccording to some criterion, i.e., an optimal decision. It is commonly assumed that\neach decision d induces a real-valued gain Jd: in that case, a decision d is considered\noptimal in D if it induces the highest gain among all decisions in D. This holds\nfor instance if each decision induces a lottery over some set of rewards, and these\nlotteries form an ordered set satisfying the axioms of von Neumann Morgenstern\nEmail address: matthias.troffaes@gmail.com (Matthias C. M. Troffaes).\n[1], or more generally, the axioms of for instance Herstein and Milnor [2], if we\nwish to account for unbounded gain.\nSo, we wish to identify the set opt (D) of all decisions that induce the highest\ngain. Since, at this stage, there is no uncertainty regarding the gains Jd, d \u2208 D,\nthe solution is simply\nopt (D) = arg max\nd\u2208D\nJd. (1)\nOf course, opt (D) may be empty; however, if the set {Jd : d \u2208 D} is a compact\nsubset of R\u2014this holds for instance if D is finite\u2014then opt (D) contains at least\none element. Secondly, note that even if opt (D) contains more than one decision,\nall decisions d in opt (D) induce the same gain Jd; so, if, in the end, the gain is\nall that matters, it suffices to identify only one decision d\u2217 in opt (D)\u2014often, this\ngreatly simplifies the analysis.\nHowever, in many situations, the gains Jd induced by decisions d in D are influ-\nenced by variables whose values are uncertain. Assuming that these variables can\nbe modelled through a random variable X that takes values in some set X (the\npossibility space), it is customary to consider the gain Jd as a so-called gamble on\nX, that is, we view Jd as a real-valued gain that is a bounded function of X, and\nthat is expressed in a fixed state-independent utility scale. So, Jd is a bounded\nX\u2013R-mapping, interpreted as an uncertain gain: taking decision d, we receive an\namount of utility Jd(x) when x turns out to be the realisation of X. For the sake of\nsimplicity, we shall assume that the outcome x of X is independent of the decision\nd we take: this is called act-state independence. What decision should we take?\nIrrespective of our beliefs about X, a decision d in D is not optimal if its gain\ngamble Jd is point-wise dominated by a gain gamble Je for some e in D, i.e., if\nthere is an e in D such that Je(x) \u2265 Jd(x) for all x \u2208 X and Je(x) > Jd(x) for\nat least one x \u2208 X : choosing e guarantees a higher gain than choosing d, possibly\nstrictly higher, regardless of the realisation of X. So, as a first selection, let us\nremove all decisions from D whose gain gambles are point-wise dominated (see\nBerger [3, Section 1.3.2, Definition 5 ff., p. 10]):\nopt\u2265 (D) := {d \u2208 D : (\u2200e \u2208 D)(Je 6\u2265 Jd or Je = Jd)} (2)\nwhere Je \u2265 Jd is understood to be point-wise, and Je 6\u2265 Jd is understood to be\nthe negation of Je \u2265 Jd. The decisions in opt\u2265 (D) are called admissible, the other\ndecisions in D are called inadmissible. Note that we already recover Eq. (1) if there\nis no uncertainty regarding the gains Jd, i.e., if all Jd are constant functions of X.\nWhen do admissible decisions exist? The set opt\u2265 (D) is non-empty if {Jd : d \u2208 D}\nis a non-empty and weakly compact subset of the set L(X ) of all gambles on X (see\n2\nTheorem 3 further on). Note that this condition is sufficient, but not necessary.\nIn what follows, we shall try to answer the following question: given additional\ninformation about X, how can we further reduce the set opt\u2265 (D) of admissi-\nble decisions? The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the classical\napproach of maximising expected utility, and explains why it is not always a de-\nsirable criterion for selecting optimal decisions. Those problems are addressed in\nSection 3, discussing alternative approaches to deal with uncertainty and optimal-\nity, all of which attempt to overcome the issues raised in Section 2, and all of\nwhich are known from the literature. Finally, Section 4 compares these alternative\napproaches, and explains how optimal decisions can be obtained in a computation-\nally efficient way. A few technical results are deferred to the appendix, where we,\namong other things, generalize a well-known technical condition on the existence\nof optimal decisions.\n2 Maximising Expected Utility?\nIn practice, beliefs about X are often modelled by a (possibly finitely additive)\nprobability measure \u00b5 on a field F of subsets of X , and one then arrives at a\nset of optimal decisions by maximising their expected utility with respect to \u00b5;\nsee for instance Raiffa and Schlaifer [4, Section 1.1.4, p. 6], Levi [5, Section 4.8,\np. 96, ll. 23\u201326], or Berger [3, Section 1.5.2, Paragraph I, p. 17]. Assuming that the\nfield F is sufficiently large such that the gains Jd are measurable with respect to\nF\u2014this means that every Jd is a uniform limit of F -simple gambles\u2014the expected\nutility of the gain gambles Jd is given by:\nE\u00b5(Jd) :=\n\u222b\nJdd\u00b5,\nwhere we take for instance the Dunford integral on the right hand side; see Dun-\nford [6, p. 443, Sect. 3], and Dunford and Schwartz [7, Part I, Chapter III, Defini-\ntion 2.17, p. 112]\u2014this linear integral extends the usual textbook integral (see for\ninstance Kallenberg [8, Chapter 1]) to case where \u00b5 is not \u03c3-additive. Recall that\nwe have assumed act-state independence: \u00b5 is independent of d.\nAs far as it makes sense to rank decisions according to the expected utility of their\ngain gambles, we should maximise expected utility :\noptE\u00b5 (D) := arg maxd\u2208opt\u2265(D)\nE\u00b5(Jd). (3)\n3\nWhen do optimal solutions exist? The set optE\u00b5 (D) is guaranteed to be non-\nempty if {Jd : d \u2208 D} is a non-empty and compact subset of the set L(X ) of\nall gambles on X , with respect to the supremum norm. Actually, this technical\ncondition is sufficient for existence with regard to all of the optimality conditions\nwe shall discuss further on. Therefore, without further ado, we shall assume that\n{Jd : d \u2208 D} is non-empty and compact with respect to the supremum norm. A\nslightly weaker condition is assumed in Theorem 5, in the appendix of this paper.\nUnfortunately, it may happen that our beliefs about X cannot be modelled by a\nprobability measure, simply because we have insufficient information to identify the\nprobability \u00b5(A) of every event A in F . In such a situation, maximising expected\nutility usually fails to give an adequate representation of optimality.\nFor example, let X be the unknown outcome of the tossing of a coin; say we only\nknow that the outcome will be either heads or tails (so X = {H,T}), and that\nthe probability of heads lays between 28% and 70%. Consider the decision set\nD = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and the gain gambles\nJ1(H) = 4, J1(T ) = 0,\nJ2(H) = 0, J2(T ) = 4,\nJ3(H) = 3, J3(T ) = 2,\nJ4(H) =\n1\n2\n, J4(T ) = 3,\nJ5(H) =\n47\n20\n, J5(T ) =\n47\n20\n,\nJ6(H) =\n41\n10\n, J6(T ) = \u2212 310 ,\nClearly, opt\u2265 (D) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and\noptE\u00b5 (D) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n{2}, if \u00b5(H) < 2\n5\n,\n{2, 3}, if \u00b5(H) = 2\n5\n,\n{3}, if 2\n5\n< \u00b5(H) < 2\n3\n,\n{1, 3}, if \u00b5(H) = 2\n3\n,\n{1}, if \u00b5(H) > 2\n3\n.\nConcluding, if we have no additional information about X, but still insist on using\na particular (and necessarily arbitrary) \u00b5, which is only required to satisfy 0.28 \u2264\n\u00b5(H) \u2264 0.7, we find that optE\u00b5 (D) is not very robust against changes in \u00b5. This\nshows that maximising expected utility fails to give an adequate representation of\noptimality in case of ignorance about the precise value of \u00b5.\n4\n3 Generalising to Imprecise Probabilities\nOf course, if we have sufficient information such that \u00b5 can be identified, nothing\nis wrong with Eq. (3). We shall therefore try to generalise Eq. (3). In doing so,\nfollowing Walley [9], we shall assume that our beliefs about X are modelled by a\nreal-valued mapping P defined on a\u2014possibly only very small\u2014set K of gambles,\nthat represents our assessment of the lower expected utility P(f) for each gamble f\nin K; 1 note that K can be chosen empty if we are completely ignorant. Essentially,\nthis means that instead of a single probability measure on F , we now identify a\nclosed convex set M of finitely additive probability measures \u00b5 on F , described\nby the linear inequalities\n(\u2200f \u2208 K)(P(f) \u2264 E\u00b5(f)). (4)\nWe choose the domain F of the measures \u00b5 sufficiently large such that all gambles\nof interest, in particular those in K and the gain gambles Jd, are measurable with\nrespect to F . Without loss of generality, we can assume F to be the power set of\nX , although in practice, it may be more convenient to choose a smaller field.\nFor a given F -measurable gamble g, not necessarily in K, we may also derive a\nlower expected utility EP(g) by minimising E\u00b5(g) subject to the above constraints,\nand an upper expected utility EP(g) = \u2212EP(\u2212g) by maximising E\u00b5(g) over the\nabove constraints. In case X and K are finite, this simply amounts to solving a\nlinear program.\nIn the literature, M is called a credal set (see for instance Giron and Rios [10],\nand Levi [5, Section 4.2, pp. 76\u201378], for more comments on this model), and P\nis called a lower prevision (because they generalise the previsions, which are fair\nprices, of De Finetti [11, Vol. I, Section 3.1, pp. 69\u201375]).\nThe mapping EP obtained, corresponds exactly to the so-called natural exten-\nsion of P (to the set of F -measurable gambles), where P(f) is interpreted as a\nsupremum buying price for f (see Walley [9, Section 3.4.1, p. 136]). In this inter-\npretation, for any s < P(f), we are willing to pay any utility s < P(f) prior to\nobservation of X, if we are guaranteed to receive f(x) once x turns out to be the\noutcome of X. The natural extension then corresponds to the highest price we can\nobtain for an arbitrary gamble g, taken into account the assessed prices P(f) for\n1 The upper expected utility of a gamble f is P(f) if and only if the lower expected\nutility of \u2212f is \u2212P(f). So, for any gamble f in K, P(\u2212f) = \u2212P(f), and therefore,\nwithout loss of generality, we can restrict ourselves to lower expected utility.\n5\nf \u2208 K. Specifically,\nEP(g) = sup\n{\n\u03b1 +\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbiP(fi) : \u03b1 +\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbifi \u2264 g\n}\n, (5)\nwhere \u03b1 varies over R, n over N, \u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbn vary over R+, and f1, . . . , fn over K.\nIt may happen thatM is empty, in which case EP is undefined (the supremum in\nEq. (5) will always be +\u221e). This occurs exactly when P incurs a sure loss as a\nlower prevision, that is, if we can find a finite collection of gambles f1, . . . , fn in K\nsuch that\n\u2211n\ni=1 P(fi) > sup [\n\u2211n\ni=1 fi], which means that we are willing to pay more\nfor this collection than we can ever gain from it, which makes no sense of course.\nFinally, it may happen that EP does not coincide with P on K. This points to a\nform of incoherence in P : this situation occurs exactly when we can find a finite\ncollection of gambles f0, f1, . . . , fn and non-negative real numbers \u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbn,\nsuch that\n\u03b1 +\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbifi \u2264 f0, but also P(f0) < \u03b1 +\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbiP(fi).\nThis means that we can construct a price for f0, using the assessed prices P(fi) for\nfi, which is strictly higher than P(f0). In this sense, EP corrects P , as is apparent\nfrom Eq. (5).\nAlthough the belief model described above is not the most general we may think\nof, it is sufficiently general to model both expected utility and complete ignorance:\nthese two extremes are obtained by takingM either equal to a singleton, or equal\nto the set of all finitely additive probability measures on F (i.e., K = \u2205). It also\nallows us to demonstrate the differences between different ways to make decisions\nwith imprecise probabilities on the example we presented before.\nIn that example, the given information can be modelled by, say, a lower prevision P\non K = {IH ,\u2212IH}, defined by P(IH) = 0.28 and P(\u2212IH) = \u22120.7, where IH is the\ngamble defined by IH(H) = 1 and IH(T ) = 0. For this P , the set M corresponds\nexactly to the set of all probability measures \u00b5 on F = {\u2205, {H}, {T}, {H,T}},\nsuch that 0.28 \u2264 \u00b5(H) \u2264 0.7. We also easily find for any gamble f on X that\nEP(f) = min{0.28f(H) + 0.72f(T ), 0.7f(H) + 0.3f(T )}.\n6\n3.1 \u0393-Maximin and \u0393-Maximax\nAs a very simple way to generalise Eq. (3), we could take the lower expected\nutility EP as a replacement for the expected utility E\u00b5 (see for instance Gilboa\nand Schmeidler [12], or Berger [3, Section 4.7.6, pp. 215\u2013223]):\noptEP (D) := arg maxd\u2208opt\u2265(D)\nEP(Jd); (6)\nthis criterion is called \u0393-maximin, and amounts to worst-case optimisation: we take\na decision that maximises the worst expected gain. For example, if we consider the\ndecision as a game against nature, who is assumed to choose a distribution in M\naimed at minimizing our expected gain, then the \u0393-maximin solution is the best we\ncan do. Applied on the example of Section 2, we find as a solution optEP (D) = {5}.\nIn case K = \u2205, i.e., in case of complete ignorance about X, it holds that EP(f) =\ninfx\u2208X f(x). Hence, in that case, \u0393-maximin coincides with maximin (see Berger\n[3, Eq. (4.96), p. 216]), ranking decisions by the minimal (or infimum, to be more\nprecise) value of their gain gambles.\nSome authors consider best-case optimisation, taking a decision that maximises\nthe best expected gain (see for instance Satia and Lave [13]). In our example, the\n\u201c\u0393-maximax\u201d solution is optEP (D) = {2}.\n3.2 Maximality\nEq. (3) is essentially the result of pair-wise preferences based on expected utility:\ndefining the strict partial order >\u00b5 on D as d >\u00b5 e whenever E\u00b5(Jd) > E\u00b5(Je), or\nequivalently, whenever E\u00b5(Jd \u2212 Je) > 0, we can simply write\noptE\u00b5 (D) = max>\u00b5\n(\nopt\u2265 (D)\n)\n,\nwhere the operator max>\u00b5 (\u00b7) selects the >\u00b5-maximal, i.e., the >\u00b5-undominated\nelements from a set with strict partial order >\u00b5.\nUsing the supremum buying price interpretation, it is easy to derive pair-wise\npreferences from P : define >P as d >P e whenever EP(Jd \u2212 Je) > 0. Indeed,\nEP(Jd \u2212 Je) > 0 means that we are disposed to pay a strictly positive price in\norder to take decision d instead of e, which clearly indicates strict preference of\n7\nd over e (see Walley [9, Sections 3.9.1\u20133.9.3, pp. 160\u2013162]). Since >P is a strict\npartial order, we arrive at\nopt>P (D) :=max>P\n(\nopt\u2265 (D)\n)\n={d \u2208 opt\u2265 (D) : (\u2200e \u2208 opt\u2265 (D))(EP(Je \u2212 Jd) \u2264 0)} (7)\nas another generalisation of Eq. (3), called maximality. Note that >P can also be\nviewed as a robustification of >\u00b5 over \u00b5 inM. Applied on the example of Section 2,\nwe find opt>P (D) = {1, 2, 3, 5} as a solution.\nNote that Walley [9, Sections 3.9.2, p. 161] has a slightly different definition: instead\nof working from the set of admissible decisions as in Eq. (7), Walley starts with\nranking d > e if EP(Jd \u2212 Je) > 0 or (Jd \u2265 Je and Jd 6= Je), and then selects\nthose decisions from D that are maximal with respect to this strict partial order.\nUsing Theorem 3 from the appendix, it is easy to show that Walley\u2019s definition of\nmaximality coincides with the one given in Eq. (7) whenever the set {Jd : d \u2208 D}\nis weakly compact. This is something we usually assume to ensure the existence\nof admissible elements; in particular, weak compactness is assumed in Theorem 5\n(see appendix). The benefit of Eq. (7) over Walley\u2019s definition is that Eq. (7) is\neasier to manage in the proofs in the appendix.\n3.3 Interval Dominance\nAnother robustification of >\u00b5 is the strict partial ordering AP defined by d AP\ne whenever EP(Jd) > EP(Je); this means that the interval [EP(Jd),EP(Jd)] is\ncompletely on the right hand side of the interval [EP(Je),EP(Je)]. The above\nordering is therefore called interval dominance (see Zaffalon, Wesnes, and Petrini\n[14, Section 2.3.3, pp. 68\u201369] for a brief discussion and references).\noptAP (D) :=maxAP\n(\nopt\u2265 (D)\n)\n={d \u2208 opt\u2265 (D) : (\u2200e \u2208 opt\u2265 (D))(EP(Je) \u2264 EP(Jd))} (8)\nThe resulting notion is weaker than maximality: applied on the example of Sec-\ntion 2, optAP (D) = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}, which is strictly larger than opt>P (D).\n8\n3.4 E-Admissibility\nIn the example of Section 2, we have shown that optE\u00b5 (D) may not be very robust\nagainst changes in \u00b5. Robustifying optE\u00b5 (D) against changes of \u00b5 inM, we arrive\nat\noptM (D) :=\n\u22c3\n\u00b5\u2208M\noptE\u00b5 (D) ; (9)\nthis provides another way to generalise Eq. (3). The above criterion selects those\nadmissible decisions in D that maximize expected utility with respect to at least\none \u00b5 in M; i.e., they select the E-admissible (see Good [15, p. 114, ll. 8\u20139], or\nLevi [5, Section 4.8, p. 96, ll. 8\u201320]) decisions among the admissible ones. We find\noptM (D) = {1, 2, 3} for the example.\nIn case \u00b5 is defined on \u2118(X ) and \u00b5({x}) > 0 for all x \u2208 X , then every E-admissible\ndecision is also admissible, and hence, in that case, optM (D) gives us exactly the\nset of E-admissible options.\n4 Which Is the Right One?\nEvidently, it is hard to pinpoint the right choice. Instead, let us ask ourselves:\nwhat properties do we want our notion of optimality to satisfy? Let us summarise\na few important guidelines.\nClearly, whatever notion of optimality, it seems reasonable to exclude inadmissible\ndecisions. For ease of exposition, let\u2019s assume that the inadmissible decisions have\nalready been removed from D, i.e., D = opt\u2265 (D); this implies in particular that\noptM (D) gives us the set of E-admissible decisions.\nNow note that, in general, the following implications hold:\n\u0393-maximax \u0393-maximin\nE-admissible maximal\ninterval dominance\n?\nHHHHHHHj ?\n-\nHHHHHHHj ?\n9\nas is also demonstrated by our example. A proof is given in the appendix, Theo-\nrem 1.\nE-admissibility, maximality, and interval dominance have the nice property that\nthe more determinate our beliefs (i.e., the smaller M), the smaller the set of\noptimal decisions. In contradistinction, \u0393-maximin and \u0393-maximax lack this prop-\nerty, and usually only select a single decision, even in case of complete ignorance.\nHowever, if we are only interested in the most pessimistic (or most optimistic)\nsolution, disregarding other reasonable solutions, then \u0393-maximin (or \u0393-maximax)\nseems appropriate. Utkin and Augustin [16] have collected a number of nice al-\ngorithms for finding \u0393-maximin and \u0393-maximax solutions, and even mixtures of\nthese two. Seidenfeld [17] has compared \u0393-maximin to E-admissibility, and argued\nagainst \u0393-maximin in sequential decision problems.\nIf we do not settle for \u0393-maximin (or \u0393-maximax), should we choose E-admissibility,\nmaximality, or interval dominance? As already mentioned, interval dominance is\nweaker than maximality, so in general we will end up with a larger (and arguably\ntoo large) set of optimal options. Assuming the non-admissible decisions have been\nweeded, a decision d is not optimal in D with respect to interval dominance if and\nonly if\nEP(Jd) < sup\ne\u2208D\nEP(Je). (10)\nThus, if D has n elements, interval dominance requires us to calculate 2n natural\nextensions, and make 2n comparisons, whereas for maximality, by Eq. (7), we must\ncalculate n2 \u2212 n natural extensions, and perform n2 \u2212 n comparisons\u2014roughly\nspeaking, each natural extension is a linear program in m (size of X ) variables and\nr (size of K) constraints, or vice versa if we solve the dual program. So, comparing\nmaximality and interval dominance, we face a tradeoff between computational\nspeed and number of optimal options.\nHowever, this also means that interval dominance is a means to speed up the cal-\nculation of maximal and E-admissible decisions: because every maximal decision\nis also interval dominant, we can invoke interval dominance as a first computa-\ntionally efficient step in eliminating non-optimal decisions, if we eventually opt\nfor maximality or E-admissibility. Indeed, eliminating those decisions d that sat-\nisfy Eq. (10), we will also eliminate those decisions that are neither maximal, nor\nE-admissible.\nRegarding sequential decision problems, we note that dynamic programming tech-\nniques cannot be used when using interval dominance (see De Cooman and Troffaes\n[18]), and therefore, since dynamic programming yields an exponential speedup,\nmaximality and E-admissibility are certainly preferred over interval dominance\n10\nonce dynamics enter the picture.\nThis leaves E-admissibility and maximality. They are quite similar: they coincide\non all decision sets D that contain two decisions. In case we consider larger de-\ncision sets, they coincide if the set of gain gambles is convex (for instance, if we\nconsider randomised decisions). As already mentioned, E-admissibility is stronger\nthan maximality, and also has some other advantages over maximality. For in-\nstance, 1\n5\nJ2 +\n4\n5\nJ3 >P J5, so, choosing decision 2 with probability 20% and decision\n3 with probability 80% is preferred to decision 5. Therefore, we should perhaps\nnot consider decision 5 as optimal.\nE-admissibility is not vulnerable to such argument, since no E-admissible decision\ncan be dominated by randomized decisions: if for some \u00b5 \u2208 M it holds that\nE\u00b5(Jd \u2212 Je) \u2265 0 for all e \u2208 D, then also\nE\u00b5\n(\nJd \u2212\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbiJei\n)\n=\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbiE\u00b5 (Jd \u2212 Jei) \u2265 0\nfor any convex combination\n\u2211n\ni=1 \u03bbiJei of gain gambles, and hence, it also holds\nthat EP (\n\u2211n\ni=1 \u03bbiJei \u2212 Jd) \u2264 0 which means that no convex combination\n\u2211n\ni=1 \u03bbiJei\ncan dominate Jd with respect to >P .\nA powerful algorithm for calculating E-admissible options has been recently sug-\ngested by Utkin and Augustin [16, pp. 356\u2013357], and independently by Kikuti,\nCozman, and de Campos [19, Sec. 3.4]. If D has n elements, finding all (pure)\nE-admissible options requires us to solve n linear programs in m variables and\nr + n constraints.\nAs we already noted, through convexification of the decision set, maximality and\nE-admissibility coincide. Utkin and Augustin\u2019s algorithm can also cope with this\ncase, but now one has to consider in the worst case n! linear programs, and usually\nseveral less: the worst case only obtains if all options are E-admissible. For instance,\nif there are only ` E-admissible pure options, one has to consider only at most\n`! + n\u2212 ` of those linear programs, and again, usually less.\nIn conclusion, the decision criterion to settle for in a particular application, depends\nat least on the goals of the decision maker (what properties should optimality sat-\nisfy?), and possibly also on the size and structure of the problem if computational\nissues arise.\n11\nAcknowledgements\nI especially want to thank Teddy Seidenfeld for the many instructive discussions\nabout maximality versus E-admissibility. I also wish to thank two anonymous ref-\nerees for their helpful comments. This paper has been supported by the Belgian\nAmerican Educational Foundation. The scientific responsibility rests with its au-\nthor.\nA Proofs\nThis appendix is dedicated to proving the connections between the various op-\ntimality criteria, and existence results mentioned throughout the paper. In the\nwhole appendix, we assume the following:\nRecall, D denotes some set of decisions, and every decision d \u2208 D induces a gain\ngamble Jd \u2208 L(X ), where L(X ) is the set of all gambles (bounded X\u2013R mappings).\nP denotes a lower prevision, defined on a subset K of L(X ). With F we denote\na field on X such that all gain gambles Jd and gambles in K are measurable with\nrespect to F , i.e., are a uniform limit of F -simple gambles. F could be for instance\nthe power set of X .\nP is assumed to avoid sure loss, and EP is its natural extension to the set of all\nF -measurable gambles.M is the credal set representing P , as defined in Section 3.\nWe will make deliberate use of the properties of natural extension (for instance,\nsuperadditivity: EP(f+g) \u2265 EP(f)+EP(g), and hence also EP(f\u2212g) \u2264 EP(f)\u2212\nEP(g)). We refer to Walley [9, Sec. 2.6, p. 76, and Sec. 3.1.2, p. 123] for an overview\nand proof of these properties.\nWe use the symbol \u00b5 for an arbitrary finitely additive probability measure on F ,\nand E\u00b5 denotes the Dunford integral with respect to \u00b5. This integral is defined on\n(at least) the set of all F -measurable gambles.\n12\nA.1 Connections between Decision Criteria\nTheorem 1 The following relations hold.\noptEP (D) \u2286 optM (D) \u2286 opt>P (D) \u2286 optAP (D)\noptEP (D) \u2286 opt>P (D)\nPROOF. Let J = {Jd : d \u2208 D}.\nSuppose that d is \u0393-maximax in D: Jd maximises EP in max\u2265(J ). Since EP is the\nupper envelope ofM, andM is weak-* compact (see Walley [9, Sec. 3.6]), there is\na \u00b5 in M such that EP(Jd) = E\u00b5(Jd). But, E\u00b5(Je) \u2264 EP(Je) \u2264 EP(Jd) = E\u00b5(Jd),\nfor every Je \u2208 max\u2265(J ) because d is \u0393-maximax. Thus, d belongs to optM (D).\nSuppose that d \u2208 optM (D): there is a \u00b5 in M such that Jd maximises E\u00b5 in\nmax\u2265(J ). But then, because EP is the lower envelope of M, EP(Je \u2212 Jd) \u2264\nE\u00b5(Je \u2212 Jd) = E\u00b5(Je) \u2212 E\u00b5(Jd) \u2264 0 for all Je in max\u2265(J ). Hence, by Eq. (7) on\np. 8, d must be maximal.\nSuppose that d is maximal. Then, again by Eq. (7), EP(Je \u2212 Jd) \u2264 0 for all Je in\nmax\u2265(J ). But, EP(Je)\u2212EP(Jd) \u2264 EP(Je \u2212 Jd), hence, also EP(Je) \u2264 EP(Jd) for\nall Je in max\u2265(J ), which means that d belongs to optAP (D).\nFinally, suppose that d is \u0393-maximin: Jd maximises EP in max\u2265(J ). But then\nEP(Je \u2212 Jd) \u2264 EP(Je)\u2212 EP(Jd) \u2264 0 for all Je in max\u2265(J ); d must be maximal.\nA.2 Existence\nWe first prove a technical but very useful lemma about the existence of optimal\nelements with respect to preorders; it\u2019s an abstraction of a result proved by De\nCooman and Troffaes [18]. Let\u2019s start with a few definitions.\nA preorder is simply a reflexive and transitive relation.\nLet V be any set, and let Q be any preorder on V . An element v of a subset S\nof V is called Q -maximal in S if, for all w in S, w Q v implies v Q w. The set of\n13\nQ -maximal elements is denoted by\nmaxQ (S) :=\n{\nv \u2208 S : (\u2200w \u2208 S)(w Q v =\u21d2 v Q w)}. (A.1)\nFor any v in S, we also define the up-set of v relative to S as\n\u2191SQv := {w \u2208 S : w Q v}.\nLemma 2 Let V be a Hausdorff topological space. Let Q be any preorder on V\nsuch that for any v in V, the set \u2191VQv is closed. Then, for any non-empty compact\nsubset S of V, the following statements hold.\n(i) For every v in S, the set \u2191SQv is non-empty and compact.\n(ii) The set maxQ (S) of Q -maximal elements of S is non-empty.\n(iii) For every v in S, there is a Q -maximal element w of S such that w Q v.\nPROOF. (i). Since Q is reflexive, it follows that v Q v, so \u2191SQv is non-empty. Is\nit compact? Clearly, \u2191SQv = S \u2229 \u2191VQv, so \u2191SQv is the intersection of a compact set\nand a closed set, and therefore \u2191SQv must be compact too.\n(ii). Let S \u2032 be any subset of the non-empty compact set S that is linearly ordered\nwith respect to Q . If we can show that S \u2032 has an upper bound in S with respect toQ , then we can infer from a version of Zorn\u2019s lemma [20, (AC7), p. 144] (which also\nholds for preorders) that S has a Q -maximal element. Let then {v1, v2, . . . , vn}\nbe an arbitrary finite subset of S \u2032. We can assume without loss of generality that\nv1 Q v2 Q \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Q vn, and consequently \u2191SQv1 \u2286 \u2191SQv2 \u2286 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2286 \u2191SQvn. This implies\nthat the intersection\n\u22c2n\nk=1 \u2191SQvk = \u2191SQv1 of these up-sets is non-empty: the collection\n{\u2191SQv : v \u2208 S \u2032} of compact and hence closed (V is Hausdorff) subsets of S has the\nfinite intersection property. Consequently, since S is compact, the intersection\u22c2\nv\u2208S\u2032 \u2191SQv is non-empty as well, and this is the set of upper bounds of S \u2032 in S with\nrespect to Q . So, by Zorn\u2019s lemma, S has a Q -maximal element: maxQ (S) is\nnon-empty.\n(iii). Combine (i) and (ii) to show that the non-empty compact set \u2191SQv has a\nmaximal element w with respect to Q . It is then a trivial step to prove that w is\nalso Q -maximal in S: we must show that for any u in S, if u Q w, then w Q u.\nBut, if u Q w, then also u Q v since w Q v by construction. Hence, u \u2208 \u2191SQv, and\nsince w is Q -maximal in \u2191SQv, it follows that w Q u.\nThe weak topology on L(X ) is simply the topology of point-wise convergence.\n14\nThat is, a net f\u03b1 in L(X ) converges weakly to f in L(X ) if lim\u03b1 f\u03b1(x) = f(x) for\nall x \u2208 X .\nTheorem 3 If J = {Jd : d \u2208 D} is a non-empty and weakly compact set, then D\ncontains at least one admissible decision, and even more, for every decision e in\nD, there is an admissible decision d in D such that Jd \u2265 Je.\nPROOF. It is easy to derive from Eq. (2) that\nopt\u2265 (D) = {d \u2208 D : (\u2200e \u2208 D)(Je \u2265 Jd =\u21d2 Jd \u2265 Je)}.\nHence, a decision is admissible in D exactly when its gain gamble is \u2265-maximal\nin J . We must show that J has \u2265-maximal elements.\nBy Lemma 2, it suffices to prove that, for every f \u2208 L(X ), the set Gf = {g \u2208\nL(X ) : g \u2265 f} is closed with respect to the topology of point-wise convergence.\nLet g\u03b1 be a net in Gf , and suppose that g\u03b1 converges point-wise to g \u2208 L(X ): for\nevery x \u2208 X , lim\u03b1 g\u03b1(x) = g(x). But, since g\u03b1(x) \u2265 f(x) for every X , it must also\nhold that g(x) = lim\u03b1 g\u03b1(x) \u2265 f(x). Hence, g \u2208 Gf . We have shown that every\nconverging net in Gf converges to a point in Gf . Thus, Gf is closed. This establishes\nthe theorem.\nLet\u2019s now introduce a slightly stronger topology on L(X ). This topology has no\nparticular name in the literature, so let\u2019s just call it the \u03c4 -topology. It is determined\nby the following convergence.\nDefinition 4 Say that a net f\u03b1 in L(X ) \u03c4 -converges to f in L(X ), if\n(i) lim\u03b1 f\u03b1(x) = f(x) for all x \u2208 X (point-wise convergence), and\n(ii) lim\u03b1 EP(|f\u03b1 \u2212 f |) = 0 (convergence in EP(| \u00b7 |)-norm).\nThis convergence induces a topology \u03c4 on L(X ): it turns L(X ) into a locally convex\ntopological vector space, which also happens to be Hausdorff. A topological basis\nat 0 consists for instance of the convex sets\n{f \u2208 L(X ) : EP(|f |) < \u000f and f(x) < \u03b4(x)},\nfor \u000f > 0, and \u03b4(x) > 0 for all x \u2208 X . It has more open sets and more closed\nsets than the weak topology, but it has less compact sets than the weak topology.\nOn the other hand, this topology is weaker than the supremum norm topology,\n15\nso it has fewer open and closed sets, and more compact sets, compared to the\nsupremum norm topology. Note that in case X is finite, it reduces to the weak\ntopology, which is in that case also equivalent to the supremum norm topology.\nNote that EP , EP , and E\u00b5 for all \u00b5 \u2208M, are \u03c4 -continuous, simply because\nEP(|f\u03b1 \u2212 f |) \u2265 |EP(f\u03b1)\u2212 EP(f)|,\nEP(|f\u03b1 \u2212 f |) \u2265 |EP(f\u03b1)\u2212 EP(f)|, and\nEP(|f\u03b1 \u2212 f |) \u2265 |E\u00b5(f\u03b1)\u2212 E\u00b5(f)|\n(see Walley [9, p. 77, Sec. 2.6.1(l)]). We will exploit this fact in the proof of the\nfollowing theorem, generalising a result due to Walley [9, p. 161, Sec. 3.9.2].\nTheorem 5 If J = {Jd : d \u2208 D} is non-empty and compact with respect to the\n\u03c4 -topology, then the following statements hold.\n(i) optE\u00b5 (D) is non-empty for all \u00b5 \u2208M.\n(ii) optEP (D) is non-empty.\n(iii) optEP (D) is non-empty.\n(iv) opt>P (D) is non-empty.\n(v) optAP (D) is non-empty.\n(vi) optM (D) is non-empty.\nPROOF. (i). Introduce the following order on L(X ): say that f Q g whenever\nE\u00b5(f) \u2265 E\u00b5(g). Let\u2019s first show that, for all f \u2208 L(X ), the set Gf = {g \u2208\nL(X ) : g Q f} is \u03c4 -closed.\nLet g\u03b1 be a net in Gf , and suppose that g\u03b1 \u03c4 -converges to g \u2208 L(X ). Since the inte-\ngral E\u00b5 is \u03c4 -continuous, it follows that E\u00b5(g) = lim\u03b1 E\u00b5(g\u03b1) \u2265 E\u00b5(f). Concluding,\ng belongs to Gf . We have established that every converging net in Gf converges to\na point in Gf . Thus, Gf is \u03c4 -closed.\nBy Lemma 2, it follows that J has at least one Q -maximal element Je, that is,\nJe maximises E\u00b5 in J . Since any \u03c4 -compact set is also weakly compact, there is a\n\u2265-maximal element Jd in J such that Jd \u2265 Je, by Theorem 3. But then, E\u00b5(Jd) \u2265\nE\u00b5(Je), and hence, Jd also maximises E\u00b5 in J . Because Jd is \u2265-maximal in J , it\nalso maximises E\u00b5 in max\u2265(J ). This establishes that d belongs to optE\u00b5 (D): this\nset is non-empty.\n(ii). Introduce the following order on L(X ): say that f Q g whenever EP(f) \u2265\n16\nEP(g). Continue along the lines of (i), using the fact that EP is \u03c4 -continuous.\n(iii). Again along the lines of (i), with f Q g whenever EP(f) \u2265 EP(g).\n(iv)&(v)&(vi).
