The\naim of this article is to stress how vital a correct understanding of population\ndynamics is for health policy and planning. The article first highlights some of\nthe major contributions demographers have made to debates about health,\nparticularly where they have helped to overcome misconceptions. It then\ndiscusses two prominent issues: population ageing in the developed world and\npopulation growth in developing countries.\nDemography is usually defined as the study of human populations \u2013 their size,\ngrowth, density and distribution \u2013 and statistics regarding birth, marriage, disease\nand death. Demographers have often suffered from \u2018identity\u2019 crises when trying to\nlocate themselves within a scientific discipline. By nature, demography is a multi-\ndisciplinary subject, which emphasises rigorous data analysis using specific methods\naccompanied by theory that is often associated with sociology, statistics, anthro-\npology, economics and public health, among others. According to some scholars,\nhealth demography has become a discipline in its own right (Pol and Thomas, 2001).\nUndoubtedly, demography\u2019s major contribution to health policy comes from\nthe study of population dynamics in the form of the determinants of fertility,\nmortality and migration. Within these areas of study, demographers have often\nbeen involved in the analysis of family dynamics, kinship effects and child\ndevelopment. In the study of mortality, demographers are usually more con-\ncerned with its implications for overall population size and structure, and\nconsequently tend to ignore rare causes of death.\nWhat is sometimes less clear is how demographers contribute to health policy\ndebates. The aim of this article is to stress how a correct understanding of\npopulation dynamics is vital for health policy and planning. The article first\nhighlights some of the major contributions demographers have made to debates\nabout health, particularly where they have helped to overcome misconceptions.\nIt then discusses, in more depth, two issues that I believe to be among the most\nprominent in these debates: population ageing in the developed world and\npopulation growth in developing countries.\n*Correspondence to: Dr Tiziana Leone, LSE Health, London School of Economics, Houghton Street,\nLondon WC2A 2AE, UK. Email: t.leone@lse.ac.uk\n1\nDemographers and health\nHealth policy development involves three stages: identifying the major disease\nproblems, designing health care systems and defining what governments can do\nusing the full range of policy instruments (Jamison and Mosley, 1991). Coherent\nhealth policies need to be strong in all three areas. Demographers have been\ncrucial in the first stage, since population changes are a key component of\nchanging health needs. Demographic analysis looks at behavioural changes in the\npopulation and how these might change a population\u2019s structure (age) and\ncomposition (gender, race, and so on) in the medium and long term. Demo-\ngraphers have also helped in developing public health programmes and designing\ninstruments to monitor and evaluate the long-term goals of these programmes \u2013\nparticularly those targeted at older people and infants (Nam, 1979).\nAdditionally, demographers have contributed to the debate on differences in\nmortality by sex and socio-economic status. While biology is a fundamental\ncomponent, social and behavioural factors have proved to be as important (Mar-\nmot et al., 1995). For example, life-course demography has been key to under-\nstanding the impact of parental choices and behaviours on child development, while\nlongitudinal and panel studies have been vital in elucidating lone parenthood effects\non child health and assessing the impact of HIV\/AIDS-related deaths on household\ncomposition, kinship and informal care (Ford and Hosegood, 2005).\nThe demographic transition\nThe main contribution of demographic thinking to wider debates about popu-\nlation change is the demographic transition theory. This has had a deep impact\non the work of national and international agencies in both the developed and\nthe developing world for the last 50 years. The theory identifies different stages\nof demographic transition based on fertility and mortality levels, ranging from\nstage one, when fertility and mortality are balanced at very high levels; to stage\ntwo, when mortality starts to decrease and fertility subsequently declines; to the\nthird stage, when population growth is close to zero, with low birth and death\nrates. This pattern has been experienced by every country in the developed\nworld and has been crucial for studies of the relationship between fertility and\nmortality. One of the major implications of the developed-world demographic\nstudies based on this model has been the realisation that fertility decline in the\ndeveloping world is not necessarily dependent on increasing industrialisation or\nmodernisation, as it was in developed countries (Caldwell, 1976).\nThe lifespan debate\nThe contribution of demographers to the current debate on whether human lifespan\nis fixed has also been crucial. Life expectancy has increased steadily over the last 140\nyears in many countries and some have argued that there is a fixed \u2018maximum\u2019\n2 T I Z I A N A L E O N E\nhuman lifespan (Hayflick, 1986). Thus far, however, the assertion of the existence of\na maximum lifespan based on biological arguments has had little scientific basis\n(Oeppen and Vaupel, 2002). Oeppen and Vaupel (2002) have shown that continuous\nimprovement in life expectancy has not slowed, and that life expectancy has not yet\nreached its maximum threshold. Since it is not feasible at this stage to set the\n\u2018maximum\u2019, as previously believed, health planners will need to allow for continuous\nincreases in the numbers and proportions of older people in the decades to come.\nSources of data and methods\nDemographers have been active in collecting nationally representative data and in\ndeveloping new methods that have been fundamental to the analysis of health\noutcomes. Census and vital registration remain among the main tools used to collect\ndata on fertility and mortality, and population registers are increasingly becoming\nthe most commonly used data source. Datasets originally collected for demographic\npurposes, such as the World Fertility Survey,1 the Demographic and Health Survey2\nprogrammes in developing countries and the Fertility and Family Survey3 pro-\ngramme in Europe, among others, have been widely used to understand health\ntrends and determinants. For example, the development of methods for evaluating\nand adjusting incomplete data has been essential to the analysis of child and adult\nmortality in developing countries (United Nations, 2002), and the work of William\nBrass at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has been seminal in\ndevising methods that allow the indirect estimation of mortality using census data in\nthe absence of complete vital statistics. Given that vital statistics in sub-Saharan\nAfrica are far from complete, there is a further need to develop demographic\ntechniques to accommodate current mortality patterns, such as those pertaining to\nHIV\/AIDS. Almost all estimates of population change in less developed countries are\nbased on demographic methods applied to simple survey questions, such as the\nnumber of older people and whether children, siblings and parents are alive.\nIn addition to empirical analyses, demographers have led methodological\ndevelopments in the analysis of mortality with frailty models, given that medical\nmodels cannot fully explain changes in mortality over time. Finally, an impor-\ntant demographic contribution has been the application and continuing devel-\nopment of life tables methods used in epidemiological and sociological analyses.\nLow fertility and ageing: a demographic time bomb or a damp squib?\nData from the United Nations (UN) Population Division (2007) show that\nbetween 1950 and 2005, the population aged 60 years and over has more than\n1 At the time, this was the world\u2019s largest survey programme. It was coordinated by the International\nStatistical Institute in the Netherlands and funded by two US-based agencies.\n2 Funded by United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n3 Coordinated by the United Nations.\nHow can demography inform health policy? 3\ntripled to 700 million in 2006 (United Nations, 2007). By 2050, it is projected\nthat there will be two billion older persons (Figure 1).\nAgeing is one of the most prominent issues demographers have focused on in the\nlast decade. A major task for demographers has been to remove the preconceptions\nand inaccuracies that surround the issue, particularly regarding future dependency\nratios.4 Population ageing arises when the increasing number of older persons\n(conventionally considered as those aged either 60 or 65 years and over) in the\npopulation is accompanied by reductions in the proportion of children, and the\naverage age of the population increases. UN projections (United Nations, 2007)\nshow that the number of older people worldwide is expected to overtake the\nnumber of children for the first time in 2047 (Figure 1). In the more developed\nparts of the world, where population ageing is more advanced, the number of\nchildren dropped below that of older persons in 1998 (Figure 2).\nIt is often assumed that population ageing is due to improvements in mor-\ntality. However, one of the counterintuitive findings of demographic research is\nthat population ageing is primarily caused by declining fertility (Coale, 1964).\nIndeed, improvements in mortality make population structures younger rather\nthan older, since in a growth period, improvements in mortality levels are faster\nand more prominent in younger than in older generations. Thus, improved\nmortality in developing countries will initially make the population structurally\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\n19\n50\n19\n55\n19\n60\n19\n65\n19\n70\n19\n75\n19\n80\n19\n85\n19\n90\n19\n95\n20\n00\n20\n05\n20\n10\n20\n15\n20\n20\n20\n25\n20\n30\n20\n35\n20\n40\n20\n45\n20\n50\nB\nill\nio\nns\n0-4\n15-59\n60+\nEstimates Projections\nFigure 1. World population by age group, 1950\u20132050.\nSource: United Nations Population Division (2007).\n4 Demographic dependency ratios are calculated by dividing the population aged 0\u201314 (or 0\u201319) plus\nthe population aged 601 (or 651) by the remaining population (conventionally called the working age\npopulation). The old age dependency ratio is calculated as the ratio of older people to the working age\npopulation.\n4 T I Z I A N A L E O N E\nyounger. Only in the most developed societies does \u2018ageing from the top\u2019 (i.e.\nincreasing life expectancy) become an issue (see below).\nThere is a wealth of research on the implications of ageing for social policy\nin general and for health policy in particular. Ageing is a key challenge for\nthe future because it is likely to put more pressure on health care financing.\nThe main issue here is that increased life expectancy is not necessarily linked\nto better health status, so people may live longer but may also experience\nlonger periods of ill health. However, growing evidence shows that traditional\npredictions of the impact of ageing on health care costs have been overstated.\nIncreasing demographic pressure on health care costs is partially counteracted\nby the postponement of death-related hospital costs to later in life, when they\nare usually lower (Seshamani and Gray, 2004). This makes an ageing \u2018crisis\u2019\nseem less likely.\nWhere the population is just starting to age, older people are usually less\neducated, generally have less knowledge of the type of services they are entitled\nto and are less likely to have secured health insurance than in developed societies\nwhere ageing started earlier (Lloyd-Sherlock, 2000). This finding is particularly\nimportant for developing countries: first, because there is concern that health\ncare systems might not be sufficiently prepared to cope with the health needs of\nolder people; and second, because steep declines in fertility have already\noccurred, which means that increasing improvements in life expectancy will lead\nto much more rapid ageing. The rise of non-communicable diseases also adds to\nalready stretched resources. Less developed countries therefore face a so-called\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\n19\n50\n19\n55\n19\n60\n19\n65\n19\n70\n19\n75\n19\n80\n19\n85\n19\n90\n19\n95\n20\n00\n20\n05\n20\n10\n20\n15\n20\n20\n20\n25\n20\n30\n20\n35\n20\n40\n20\n45\n20\n50\nM\nill\nio\nns\n0-4\n15-59\n60+\nProjectionsEstimates\nFigure 2.

Ageing\nand the rise of chronic diseases will exacerbate resource constraints in devel-\noping regions.\nThe move to an ageing society involves a large shift in the burden of providing\nincome support and care giving. Women still provide most childcare and care for\nolder people in Western societies (Robine et al., 2008). More research is needed\non the impact of delayed fertility on caring for older people. In addition, with a\nrising proportion of childless people entering old age over the next two decades,\nproviding care for these groups will emerge as an increasing challenge.\nNearly all of the European nations have experienced long-term declines in\nfertility for the past century or so and a consequent ageing of their populations,\nbut recognition of the implications of population ageing have only recently\nattracted significant interest. The level of ageing differs across Europe, with\ncountries like Italy, Germany and Spain being particularly affected due to their\nlower levels of fertility and immigration compared with Scandinavian countries.\nLower fertility means fewer siblings, and increases in childlessness diminish the\npotential for family networks to provide social, psychological and economic\nsupport. However, research shows that even in countries with the lowest fertility,\nlevels of childlessness have been modest and constant (almost 50% of women\nhave at least one child in most cases) (Kohler et al., 2006). Women want to have\nat least one child but delay doing so more than in the past. As a result, increases in\ndependency ratios in Europe will be lower than expected. Nonetheless, low levels\nof fertility are likely to persist in the coming decades and will have a big impact\non the population age structure and the social care systems of the countries\naffected (Kohler et al., 2006). Understanding how age structures develop in the\nfuture will be crucial to understanding the health care needs of ageing societies.\nRobine et al. (2007) focus on the intergenerational support needed for the oldest\npeople. In particular, they highlight the importance of considering long-term care\nor capacity within families to care for older people. As noted above, most studies\nusually rely on the demographic dependency ratio, given by the proportion of over\n65-year-olds over the proportion of persons of working age, as a measure of the\nextent of ageing. Given the increasing lengthening of life expectancy and the issues\nlinked to quality of life at older ages, this ratio does not reflect the extent of the\nproblem. The so-called \u2018sandwich\u2019 generation (in their mid-50s) will play a great\nrole in the level of support offered to older people. It has therefore been suggested\nthat the oldest old support ratio (i.e. the ratio of the population aged between 50\nand 74 to those aged over 85) should be used when analysing the level of ageing of\nthe population. The study by Robine et al. (2008) shows how in countries such as\nSwitzerland and the United States, the oldest old support ratio has declined steadily\n(alongside an increase in the dependency ratio), which could indicate a decline in\nthe availability of informal care. In other words, the 50\u201374-year-old generation\n6 T I Z I A N A L E O N E\nwill not be sufficiently large to look after the increasing number of over 85-year-\nolds. Obviously, the use of formal care will increase (unless the average con-\ntribution per carer increases), but it will not be able to replace the flexibility,\nconvenience and, for the \u2018public purse\u2019, cheapness of informal care.\nAnother factor that needs more attention is analysis of the partnership\nexperiences of older people. The current generation of older people has had high\nlevels of marriage and low levels of divorce. When those born in the 1960s, who\nhave experienced high rates of partnership breakdown, childlessness and solo\nliving, start to age, the issue of the availability of informal care will be more\npertinent. It is important to stress, however, that alarmist tones of \u2018crisis\u2019 are not\njustified at present, since there is still strong support available from partners and\nthis particular generation will not reach retirement age for another 30 years.\nPro-natalist policies and migration have been suggested as possible solutions\nto ageing in developed countries (United Nations, 2007). However, pro-natalist\npolicies do not always take into account the timescale of population dynamics.\nThere is a need for more research on the timing of childbearing as well as on\nfuture levels of fertility in the current \u2018lowest-low\u2019 fertility countries (i.e. those\nwith a total fertility rate below 1.3 children). Fertility is actually rising in some\nof the lowest fertility countries, as evidence collected by the Population Refer-\nence Bureau shows (Haub, 2008). Although migrants are usually of working age\nand would rebalance the age structure of ageing populations, rigorous demo-\ngraphic analysis shows that immigration cannot be a long-term solution (Keely,\n2001). The level of migration needed to compensate for current levels of fertility\nmight be unsustainable for the host countries, since migrants also need services\n(health, education, and so on) for themselves and their families. Instead,\nincreasing the participation of women and older people in the labour market in\ncountries like Italy or Spain, for example, could be more effective than migra-\ntion in meeting the problems of population ageing (Keely, 2001).\nThe role of demography in health policy in developing countries\nWhile population ageing has been a topic of considerable interest in developed\ncountries, the great majority of the increase in the numbers of older people in the\nyears to come will occur in developing countries. However, in these societies,\npopulation growth remains the prominent issue, with major implications for\nhealth policy.\nThere is a wealth of evidence on the relationship between health and devel-\nopment (Phillips and Verhasselt, 1994). The literature on the topic is rich and\nhighlights the fact that establishing causality is not always straightforward. One\nelement of this relationship is the demographic dividend: the decline in fertility,\nwhich helped to reduce the dependency ratio, leading to less need for investment\nin younger age groups (immunisation, health costs) and increasing productivity\n(Lee and Mason, 2006). Demographers have played a fundamental role in\nHow can demography inform health policy? 7\nidentifying the link between poor health and demographic transition, and were\namong those who rejected the assumption that improvements in health must\nnecessarily be the result of increases in income (Bloom and Canning, 2000). In\nareas such as sub-Saharan Africa, demographers are focusing their attention on\nhow fertility may decline in the era of HIV\/AIDS due to the delayed onset of\nsexual relations and age at first union, reduced premarital sexual relations and\nremarriage, increased marital dissolution and lower fertility among HIV positive\nwomen. However, the most important contribution of demographers to the\ndevelopment agenda at the moment is in the debate on population growth.\nPopulation growth\nThe less developed regions\u2019 population is currently growing at a rate of 1.4%\nper year (Figure 3), and growth rates in Africa as a whole exceed 2.3% per year,\nthe highest growth rate of any major area (United Nations Population Division,\n2006). In recent decades much attention has been given to the mortality\nimplications of HIV\/AIDS pandemics, but the continuing importance of popu-\nlation growth has been highlighted by an increasing number of academic and\npolicy papers dedicated to this issue (De Souza et al., 2003; Cleland et al., 2006;\nAll Party Parliamentary Group on Population, 2007). There are two key issues:\npopulation growth is slowing down the achievement of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and has a detrimental impact on the environment\nand food security. Demographers are calling upon governments to pay more\nattention to population growth issues in general and family planning in parti-\ncular, which are not as prominent now as they were after the UN Conference on\nPopulation and Development held in Cairo, in 1994.\nRegardless of their limitations, the MDGs have drawn attention to population\ngrowth and family planning issues. The report by the UK parliamentary enquiry,\nin particular, highlights how, as the population grows, so does the demand for\nhealth care (All Party Parliamentary Group on Population, 2007). The report\ncalls for an increase in funding if the MDGs are to be achieved and stresses that,\nfor example, maternal mortality needs to be addressed urgently because one\nwoman still dies every minute from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.\nLack of family planning means increasing unwanted pregnancies and conse-\nquently, unsafe abortions in limited, often illegal settings.\nThe stalling of the fertility decline in many sub-Saharan countries is also a\ncause for concern. Many claim that the policy focus has gradually shifted\ntowards HIV\/AIDS at the expense of other health-related and population\ngrowth issues (Shiffman, 2008). This reflects the fact that a steady decline in\nfertility was taken for granted and that there has been a lack of collaboration\nbetween demographers and economists in trying to cost issues such as family\nplanning and maternal mortality. I believe that while a more balanced approach\nto addressing population growth is needed, there is also a need to learn from\n8 T I Z I A N A L E O N E\n01,000,000\n2,000,000\n3,000,000\n4,000,000\n5,000,000\n6,000,000\n7,000,000\n8,000,000\n9,000,000\nYear\nT\no\nt\na\nl\n \nP\no\np\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nPopulation G\nrowth Rate (%)\nTotal % growth rate Medium Variant Projection\n20\n45\n-20\n50\n20\n40\n-20\n45\n20\n35\n-20\n40\n20\n30\n-20\n35\n20\n25\n-20\n30\n20\n20\n-20\n25\n20\n15\n-20\n20\n20\n10\n-20\n15\n20\n05\n-20\n10\n20\n00\n-20\n05\n19\n95\n-20\n00\n19\n90\n-19\n95\n19\n85\n-19\n90\n19\n80\n-19\n85\n19\n75\n-19\n80\n19\n70\n-19\n75\n19\n65\n-19\n70\n19\n60\n-19\n65\n19\n55\n-19\n60\n19\n50\n-19\n55\nFigure 3.

The economic ana-\nlysis of the impact of HIV\/AIDS on health care systems and households has been\none of the major successes of the campaign to obtain support from donors and\nto get governments on board. Similarly, demographers should engage more with\nother social scientists on population growth and its impact on development, as\nwas done so successfully when incorporating lessons about the role of birth\nspacing on child mortality derived from fertility and family surveys.\nConclusion\nLooking at the World Health Organization\u2019s definition of health as \u2018\u2018a state of\ncomplete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of\ndisease or infirmity\u2019\u2019, the socio-demographic components can be easily identi-\nfied. The role of demographers is wider than a mere study of mortality trends\nand is centred on the analysis of the impact of population dynamics on health\nand health care. Demographers have shown how population ageing is mainly\ncaused by an overall change in age structure determined by fertility; only a\nminor aspect of this is due to increasing life expectancy. When considering\nappropriate health policy for health care systems to cope with increasing\ndemand for care for older people, it is important to think not just about the\nhigher number of older people in the population, but about who will care for\nthem. Analysis of age structures and marriage patterns will also be crucial\nbecause 50\u201374-year-olds play a fundamental role in providing informal care.\nBetter understanding of the timing of fertility and life expectancy, migration and\nmarriage dynamics over the next 50 years will be vital for health policy plan-\nners. Similarly, in developing countries, where continuous population growth is\nthe result of steady fertility levels in a period of decreasing mortality, analysis of\nfertility trends is crucial to understanding the impact that population growth\nwill have on development and on health care systems.\nAcknowledgement\nI would like to thank Professor Mike Murphy for his valuable comments on an\nearlier draft of this article.\nReferences\nAll Party Parliamentary Group On Population, D.
