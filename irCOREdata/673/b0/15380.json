Two-photon absorption and three-photon absorption are\nproved to be responsible for the intense luminescence, when the wavelength of the fs excitation laser is\nabove and below the half-bandgap of ZnO, respectively. Strong MPA absorption in ZnO is unambiguously\nevidenced by the interferometric autocorrelation measurements of the luminescence signal. \u00a9 2005 Optical\nSociety of America\nOCIS codes: 190.5970, 250.5230.\nRecently ZnO has attracted renewed interest as a\npromising optoelectronic material in the UV for laser\ndiodes and light-emitting diodes operating at room\ntemperature owing to its wide bandgap and ex-\ntremely large binding energy of free excitons.1\u20134 In\nthe past several years, spontaneous and stimulated\nemissions, the dynamics of photoexcited carriers,\ndonor\u2013acceptor pair recombination, and the depen-\ndence of photoluminescence (PL) on excitation power\nin ZnO and its microstructures have been extensively\ninvestigated.5\u20139 All these studies were based on\nsingle-photon absorption induced by ultrafast UV la-\nsers. Investigations of the nonlinear optical proper-\nties and ultrafast optical processes in ZnO based on\ntwo-photon and even multiphoton absorption (MPA),\nhowever, have been relatively few.10\u201315 In particular,\nMPA-induced luminescence in ZnO has not been re-\nported to our knowledge. Here we attempt to fill this\nvoid. Using a near-IR tunable-wavelength femtosec-\nond laser, we observed efficient MPA-induced PL of\nZnO at room temperature. The dependence on excita-\ntion power and the interferometric autocorrelation\ncurves of the PL intensity were measured. Unam-\nbiguous experimental evidence for two-photon ab-\nsorption (2PA) and three-photon absorption (3PA)\nwas found when the photon energies of the excitation\nlaser were higher and lower, respectively, than the\nhalf-bandgap of ZnO. In particular, the observation of\nefficient 3PA in ZnO is of scientific significance be-\ncause this phenomenon is rarely reported in wide-\nbandgap semiconductor materials.\nThe sample used in this study is a wurtzite ZnO\nsingle crystal with thickness of \u00021 mm. Its linear PL\nproperties under excitation by a He:Cd cw UV laser\n(325 nm) are well characterized, and the results ob-\ntained agree well with those reported in the litera-\nture. The femtosecond laser source used in our ex-\nperiments is a 10 W solid-state laser- (Millennia)\npumped self-mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator (Tsu-\nnami). It delivers \u000280 fs laser pulses with a repeti-\ntion rate of 82 MHz. The tunable wavelength range of\nthe pulses is 700\u20131000 nm, and their maximum out-\nput power can reach 1.7 W at 800 nm. During the\nmeasurements the excitation laser is almost nor-\nmally incident onto the surface of sample. The lumi-\nnescence signal from the sample is collected with a\npair of lenses and is dispersed with an Acton SP300\nmonochromator equipped with a photomultiplier\n(Hamamatsu R928) detector. A blue band color filter\nis used to block the laser line. A standard lock-in am-\nplification technique is employed for the PL measure-\nments. For power-dependent measurements the in-\ntensity of the incident laser is controlled with a\nneutral-density metallic filter. The interferometric\nautocorrelation measurements of the sample PL sig-\nnal are carried out with an experimental arrange-\nment based on a Michaelson interferometer.16 For the\nPL interferometric autocorrelation measurements\nthe time delay between two collinear laser beams\nwith identical intensity is determined with a time-\ndelay translation stage (PI, Germany) that has sub-\nfemtosecond time resolution. All the experiments are\nperformed at room temperature.\nFigure 1 shows representative MPA-induced PL\nspectra of ZnO excited by a femtosecond laser with\nseveral laser wavelengths at room temperature.\nThere are two emission bands: a narrow UV band at\n395 nm (3.14 eV) and a broad visible (VIS) band cen-\ntered at \u0002492 nm (2.52 eV). The peaks marked by\nvertical arrows are the second-harmonic generation\nsignals of the laser lines.17,18 The UV emission band\nis due to electron\u2013hole plasma emission, which is 230\nmeV below the bandgap, \u00023.37 eV (368 nm) of ZnO\nat room temperature and is a result of bandgap\nrenormalization that happens immediately after in-\ntense excitation and has been well discussed in the\nDecember 15, 2005 \/ Vol. 30, No. 24 \/ OPTICS LETTERS 3377\n0146-9592\/05\/243377-3\/$15.00 \u00a9 2005 Optical Society of America\nliterature.8,9 The broad VIS emission band is due to\nthe deep luminescent centers in ZnO. As the energies\nof the excitation photons are well below the bandgap\nof ZnO, the observed luminescence bands are cer-\ntainly due to MPA. To elucidate the MPA properties\nwe measured the dependence of the UV emission\nband on excitation power for several laser wave-\nlengths, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 on a loga-\nrithmic scale. The threshold of the excitation power\nfor MPA and its wavelength dependence are appar-\nently from the data in Fig. 2. Under the experimental\nconditions of the present study, the PL can be de-\ntected for excitation powers as low as 10 mW when\nthe wavelength is less than 730 nm. However, if the\nwavelength of the excitation laser is longer than 780\nnm, an excitation power as large as 200 mW is re-\nquired for observation of the luminescence signal. As\nis discussed and evidenced below, 2PA and 3PA domi-\nnate for wavelengths of \u0002730 and \u0003780 nm, respec-\ntively. For the wavelength range 730\u2013780 nm, 2PA\nand 3PA coexist. In Fig. 2 the solid curves are the re-\nsults of fitting to the experimental data. The slopes\nobtained are 2.5 for 700 and 720 nm, 3.4 for 760 and\n780 nm, 3.8 for 800 nm, and 4.3 for 820, 840, and 880\nnm. It is known that the theoretical values are 2 and\n3 for 2PA and 3PA, respectively. The deviation of the\nfitting results from the theoretical values may be at-\ntributed to the involvement of the defect states inside\nthe bandgap in the multiphoton transition, which is\nalso observed in GaN material.19 The contributions of\nthe defect states are not discussed here.\nThe interferometric autocorrelation technique is\nfrequently used for quantitative characterization of\nMPA and ultrashort laser pulses.16,20\u201324 To further in-\nvestigate MPA in ZnO, we conducted the interfero-\nmetric autocorrelation experiments for the UV emis-\nsion band at 395 nm. The representative\nexperimental curves are depicted in Fig. 3. Note that\nthe signal intensity is normalized with respect to the\nbackground value that is the signal intensity when\nthe delay time is long enough. If the wavelength of\nthe excitation light is less than 730 nm (the corre-\nsponding photon energy is just above the half-\nbandgap of ZnO), only 2PA takes place. For 2PA the\ntheoretical signal\u2013background ratio should be 8:1.\nMeasured values are in excellent agreement with\ntheoretical predictions for wavelengths of 710 and\n720 nm. When the laser wavelength is set at 760 nm,\nthe recorded ratio reaches 10:1, which indicates the\ninvolvement of 3PA. As the wavelength is further in-\ncreased, the ratio also increases. When the wave-\nlength is increased to 775 nm, the ratio becomes\n\u000226:1. This means that the contribution of 3PA in-\ncreases, which is consistent with the data in Fig. 2.\nWhen the wavelength is beyond 778 nm the ratio is\nas high as 32:1, which is the theoretical value for\n3PA. This result unambiguously shows that 3PA ab-\nsorption occurs.\nNow we discuss the relation of the VIS emission\nband to deep centers in ZnO.7,8,25 Our group\u2019s de-\ntailed study of combined theory and experiment has\nshown that this broad VIS band is from the radiative\ntransition of vibronic states owing to strong coupling\nbetween a deeply localized electron and a local oscil-\nlator phonon of ZnO. The deep center is located at\n\u00020.52 eV below the bottom of the conduction band of\nZnO. The corresponding wavelength of a direct opti-\ncal transition from the deep center to the valence\nband of ZnO is \u0002435 nm. From Fig. 1 it can be seen\nFig. 1. MPA-induced PL spectra of ZnO at room\ntemperature.\nFig. 2. Dependence on excitation power of the integrated\nintensity of the UV emission band. Solid curves are the re-\nsults of fitting.\nFig. 3. Measured interferometric autocorrelation traces of\nthe UV emission band of the sample excited by laser pulses\nof four wavelengths.\n3378 OPTICS LETTERS \/ Vol. 30, No. 24 \/ December 15, 2005\nthat the relative intensity of the VIS emission band\nwith respect to the UV emission band is strongly de-\npendent on the wavelength of the excitation laser\nand thus on the means of excitation. In the wave-\nlength range where 2PA is dominant, the peak inten-\nsity of the VIS band is comparable with that of the\nUV band. However, for the longer wavelengths the\nVIS band becomes dominant. According to the discus-\nsion above, we know that the threshold wavelength of\n2PA for the broad VIS band is \u0002870 nm, whereas the\nthreshold wavelength of 2PA for the UV band is\n\u0002730 nm. Therefore, when the excitation wave-\nlengths are \u0003730 and \u0002870 nm, the deep centers can\nbe directly populated by electrons in the valence\nband by means of coherent 2PA. Note that 3PA ab-\nsorption contributes mainly to the population of the\nconduction band and thus to the UV luminescence for\nthis wavelength range. It is well known that the\ncross section of 2PA is much greater than that of 3PA.\nThe population density is proportional to the cross\nsection of absorption, which determines the lumines-\ncence intensity to a great extent. It is thus not diffi-\ncult for one to understand that the VIS emission\nband becomes dominant when the wavelength of the\nexcitation laser is longer than 730 nm.\nWe mention briefly the contribution of the deep\ncenters to the UV emission. Some electrons already\npopulated at the deep centers can be further excited\nto the conduction band by absorption of one photon of\nthe excitation laser. In principle, this is a linear ab-\nsorption process because the energy spacing between\nthe deep centers and the conduction band is only 0.52\neV. However, populating the deep centers is a nonlin-\near 2PA. It is the contribution of the deep centers\nthat gives the UV emission band a mixed character of\n2PA and 3PA, as indicted by the data in Figs. 2 and 3.\nIn summary, multiphoton-absorption-induced lu-\nminescence in ZnO at room temperature has been\nstudied by investigation of the power dependence and\ninterferometric autocorrelation of the luminescence\nsignal. We have demonstrated that two-photon and\nthree-photon absorption are dominant while the exci-\ntation photon energies are above and below the half-\nbandgap of ZnO, respectively. The effects of defect\nstates were also discussed. These results show that\nZnO is a promising material for nonlinear optical ap-\nplications.\nThe work was supported by Hong Kong RGC-\nCERG grants under contract HKU-7036\/03P and by\nUniversity of Hong Kong research grants under con-\ntract 10205780.\nS.
