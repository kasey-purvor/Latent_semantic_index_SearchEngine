This article makes a comparison between suggestions for online\ncourse design from research literature and user perspectives from a focus group, responses to ques-\ntions on the most and least effective aspects of online study and lasting impressions, and from reflec-\ntive diaries kept by two of the authors while they were engaged in study from online courses. This\ndirect evidence is used to highlight key issues in the literature from the viewpoint of the learner.\nIntroduction\nAcademics developing courses have their own experiences as students to draw upon.\nThe experience of online learning, however, is still new to many people and many\ndevelopers of online courses have no experience of learning online before trying to\nteach in this mode. Although developers of online courses can draw on their experi-\nences in other modes of teaching and learning, lack of experience as an online learner\nmakes it particularly difficult for people to design and teach in this mode. This lack\nof student experience means they may not know what practices to avoid and therefore\nthey may inadvertently cause unforseen difficulties for the students.\nThis paper considers online learning from the perspectives of the teacher\/design-\ners, and the students, of courses that are entirely online for off-campus students. A\nmajor issue for teachers and designers is to attain a level of student engagement with\nthe course, to keep students on track and making satisfactory progress, and to\nensure that students are developing effective levels of knowledge and skill. In many\ninstances, this means using online discussions as a substitute for on-campus tutorial\n*Corresponding author.

These discussions present interesting challenges for both teachers\nand students who may be relatively inexperienced with this mode of learning and\nteaching.\nResearch literature on the constructivist approach to learning and teaching and the\nimplications for online course design, is considered to identify some key design issues\nfor online courses. This is considered in relation to student feedback from surveys,\nfocus groups and reflective diaries, to gain student perspectives on online courses.\nThese include feedback from the authors, reflecting on their own recent experiences\nas online students. Student perspectives are compared with recommendations from\nresearch literature to suggest some practices to avoid, and some tips for better prac-\ntice, from the perspective of the online student.\nOnline learning and teaching\nA key point identified from research is that teaching and learning online requires an\napproach to instructional design that embeds effective learning strategies. Current\napproaches to curriculum design demonstrate a move from content-centred curricula\nto designs that focus on learning outcomes (Oliver & Omari, 1999). This change\nreflects the adoption of constructivist approaches to teaching and learning. Active\nlearning by problem solving is a key aspect of any constructivist environment (Reeves\n& Okey, 1996). Oliver and Omari (1999) suggest that effective university learning\ninvolves: \n\u0002 high levels of activity and engagement;\n\u0002 a motivating environment based on a well structured knowledge base;\n\u0002 finding solutions to real-world problems;\n\u0002 collaborative problem-solving;\n\u0002 active communication among students and with the tutor.\nThese learning activities are seen to support higher-order thinking and learning.\nCourseware designed to incorporate these forms of constructivist learning activities is\nlikely to support effective learning.\nMany approaches to online courseware show a tendency to \u2018reformat on campus\ncourse materials and learning strategies into an online form\u2019 (Parker, cited in Oliver\n& Omari, 1999, p. 2). This approach is considered to be an underutilization of the\ntechnology. Some approaches to online material for off-campus students have been\nidentified as using a \u2018write\/text\u2019 paradigm. This is characterized by a didactic\napproach in which \u2018learners were presented with screens of information followed by\nassessment activities to demonstrate recall and understanding\u2019 (Brunetto et al., 1999,\np. 64). These approaches, while they achieve the important goal of enabling off-\ncampus students to study online, do not apply the constructivist approaches devel-\noped to attain higher-order learning outcomes.\n Course developers as students\n \n149\n                  Constructivist approach\nThe constructivist theoretical position has led to a range of approaches to instruc-\ntional design of online courseware that exemplify specific approaches such as prob-\nlem-based or case-based learning or collaborative learning. Problem or case-based\napproaches immerse the learner in complex tasks that reflect the type of real-world\nissue that the learners will have to deal with as a working professional. Online tech-\nnologies are used to present the problem scenario and support the student with guid-\nance, access to information, resources, and learning tools. Problem solving activities\nmay be individual or group activities (e.g. Romiszowski, 1990; Oliver & Omari, 1999;\nMinasian-Batmanian et al., 2000). Collaborative learning approaches develop skills in\nteamwork, negotiation, taking account of other perspectives, information seeking and\nanalysis, and critical thinking. These approaches are also likely to be based around\ncase-based scenarios, however the instructional process is specifically designed to be\nstudent focused and to develop skills in problem-solving as a group (Milter & Stinson,\n1995; McAlpine, 2000). These approaches have been specifically developed to\naddress deficiencies in typical graduate skill profiles by fostering higher-order cogni-\ntive skills and personal communication, problem-solving and teamwork skills.\nCentral to aiding knowledge construction is raising the learner\u2019s awareness and\nunderstanding of the process of learning\u2014that is to develop their metacognitive skills\nor ability to learn how to learn. This may involve, for instance, helping learners\ndevelop awareness of how they go about learning, their learning goals, the ability to\nplan and evaluate learning strategies, and to monitor progress (Jonassen et al., 1993;\nReeves, 1999). This is also a crucial element in allowing students to gain control over\ntheir learning, and to become self-directed learners, which is widely accepted as a goal\nof student-centred learning (Brookfield, 1986; Laurillard, 2002).\nLearning communities\nLearning communities, or communities of practice, are considered to have evolved\nfrom the constructivist approach as a way of addressing authentic problems (Johnson,\n2001). Their purpose and value are closely related to the key concepts of constructiv-\nism, including: \n\u0002 open-ended problems;\n\u0002 learning from real-world problems;\n\u0002 having shared goals;\n\u0002 using cognitive tools; and\n\u0002 a tutor\u2019s role as facilitator or coach (Johnson, 2001).\nIn a course structured on these concepts, the process of dealing with problems in a\ncollaborative way is considered to foster, and be aided by, a sense of community\namong learners. Processes that open up the learning process to facilitate participation,\nand to enable learners to move from peripheral to central status as quickly as possible\nare valuable in this context (Wegerif, 1998). The role of the tutor in facilitating this\n 150\n \nI. McAlpine\n                   process by providing guidance, and the course design in providing access and\nsupport, are important contributors to creating the appropriate level of collaboration\n(Oliver et al., 1998).\nOnline discussion\nAppropriate and effective use of online discussion forums is a critical part of the\ninstructional design process for online learning, as this enables the communication\nand tutor facilitation processes. Discussion forums, both synchronous and asynchro-\nnous, may be the main form of communication between the tutor and the students,\nand among students when the students are off-campus. As the online discussions play\na critical role in the teaching\/learning process, the use of discussion forums needs to\nbe planned to integrate into the overall learning process.\nThe vital part of using online discussion in any format is to keep the students\nactively engaged. Palloff and Pratt (1999) suggest a range of activities that foster\nactive engagement, including: \n\u0002 posting instructions and learning expectations;\n\u0002 forming teams and posting guidelines for their performance;\n\u0002 encouraging a search for real life examples;\n\u0002 using dialogue as enquiry by encouraging thought provoking expansive question-\ning;\n\u0002 sharing responsibility for facilitation among group members;\n\u0002 promoting constructive feedback.\nMethods for facilitating dialogue as enquiry may include using open-ended questions\n(e.g. \u2018what do you consider to be the ethics of a computing professional?\u2019 McLoughlin\n& O\u2019Sullivan, 2000, p. 47) or using statements that are designed to promote discus-\nsion (Palloff & Pratt, 1999).\nThe tutor\u2019s role\nThe role of the online tutor is critical in attaining effective learning outcomes. Tutors\nneed to set appropriate activities and provide the right kind of guidance. Feedback\nfrom experienced tutors indicates that online tutoring can be more demanding than\ntutoring in a face-to-face situation. Some students show a high level of appreciation\nfor online conferences, but students are likely to be dissatisfied if there is a lack of\nparticipation by others (Mason & Weller, 2000). For online discussion to be success-\nful the topics must be clearly related and relevant to the learning situation, and the\nonline discussion needs to be an integral part of the learning process. Students need\nto be motivated through appropriate activities (Salmon, 2002) and participation\nshould be directly assessed or associated with assessment tasks. Those who are not\nactive in the course should be contacted and monitored by the tutor. Without that\nsupport, even the most experienced learner can fall behind and out of a course\n(Roffett, 2000).\n Course developers as students\n \n151\n                Guidance and scaffolding\nTraditional approaches to instructional design emphasize the importance of\nstudent and instructor guides as components of a learning package (e.g. Dick &\nCarey, 1985). Online courses may not use this design element, which can lead to\nproblems for students using online courseware. In an evaluation of a range of\nonline courseware, Brunetto et al. (1999) identify learning supports, or scaffolding,\nas an essential element of online learning (with learning activities and content).\nThey also found that scaffolding was not a common design aspect in many of the\nonline courses and that the means of doing this varied widely due to the lack of\nstandard approaches to design for online courses. They suggest several approaches\nto this, including: \n\u0002 learners can be encouraged to scaffold learners;\n\u0002 teachers\/trainers\/facilitators can act to scaffold learners;\n\u0002 learning systems can be designed to track learners\u2019 progress and to provide intelli-\ngent tutoring to guide further activity based on previous learning success;\n\u0002 electronic support systems can be created with the capacity to provide assistance\nat the point of need (Brunetto et al., 1999, p. 67).\nScaffolding can be considered as guidance and support needed at the beginning of a\ncourse or activity that can be withdrawn or ignored once the student is competent to\nmanage the activity. Hannafin et al. (1999, p.131) describe a range of guidance or\nscaffolding approaches that may be necessary in courseware to assist the learner\ntowards the most effective learning. These are: \nProcedural Guides the learner in using the technology in order to engage in the\nlearning activities.\nConceptual Guides learner in what to consider; considerations when problem\ntask is defined.\nMetacognitive Guides how to think during learning: ways to think about a\nproblem under study and\/or possible strategies to consider; initial\nrole in finding and framing problems, and ongoing role during\nresolution.\nStrategic Guides in analysing and approaching learning tasks or problem;\nprovided initially as macrostrategy or ongoing as needs or requests\narise.\nStudent guidance, focusing on these aspects, may be incorporated into the course in\ndifferent ways. Procedural guides would focus on finding a way around the course\nmaterials and how to do some of the basic organizational aspects. Other guides might\nrelate to study skills, such as managing the learning process and working with other\nstudents on group tasks. These guidelines may be embedded in the courseware or\nactions by the tutor, or both.\n 152\n \nI. McAlpine\n              Review of courseware design issues\nThe constructivist approach, with its emphasis on open-ended problem solving and\ncollaboration, is considered by many to be the most effective design model for an\nonline course. This approach is based on models for learning and teaching that have\nbeen developed to achieve high-level learning outcomes. Critical factors for online\ncourse design are to create learning activities based on constructivist principles, and\nto design online processes that enable these learning activities even though the\nstudents are off-campus. Online discussions play a key role in enabling group prob-\nlem-solving, the formation of a learning community, the facilitation of knowledge\nconstruction by the tutor and provision of guidance in the most effective approaches\nto the learning task. Online course design also involves the provision of access to rele-\nvant information, and to an appropriate level of guidance, through the tutor and other\nmeans such as guides to process and technical support, to enable the student to focus\non the learning task and to carry it out effectively.\nThe following section of the paper describes the authors\u2019 approach to gathering\nfeedback from student experiences of online study, taking account of the desirable\nonline course features considered above.\nMethod\nThe aim of the project was to gather data that reflected the experiences of the authors\nand close colleagues in relation to being a student on a course conducted entirely\nonline, and to consider how these data reflected on approaches to online course\ndesign. Awareness of the desirable attributes of an online course, outlined above, was\nan important consideration in the study. By taking account of the student perspective,\nan examination of the implementation of course design could be conducted. This\nreflects some of the outcomes of the design approach, and leads to some suggestions\nfor providing effective support to students in the design and implementation of online\ncourses.\nResearch questions\nThe following questions were used as a focus for this study: \n\u0002 What elements of the design of online learning courses contribute to effective\noutcomes?\n\u0002 What can the experience of online learning contribute to the improvement of\nonline course design?\nData gathering\nThe following data sources were drawn upon: \n\u0002 Reflective diaries kept by two of the authors while they were students in an online\ncourse on the topic of online learning, studied in 2001.\n Course developers as students\n \n153\n                   \u0002 A survey that included some authors and close associates who were also develop-\ners. The survey had three open-ended questions, asking about positive experiences\nof online study, negative experiences, and lasting impressions. Surveys were sent\nto five people and four were completed.\n\u0002 A focus group, conducted by one of the authors, with a group of students who were\nexperienced in online learning. This group had completed a year of part time study\nfor an online masters program. One of the authors was involved in the design of the\ncourse, and was known to the students. Twelve students participated in the focus\ngroup at the end of the 2000 academic year.\nThe method of analysis was to group the responses thematically, so that a range of\ncomparative and contrasting perspectives were available on the key issues. Data from\nall sources have been aggregated to enable a thematic grouping, using the actual\nwords from the data sources as much as possible, to reflect the student experiential\nperspective (Seidman, 1991).\nResults\nStudent comments from the focus group and the diaries reflect the major issues for\ncourse design outlined in the literature review: \n\u0002 course design around open-ended, real-world problems;\n\u0002 group problem-solving;\n\u0002 developing a learning community;\n\u0002 the tutor\u2019s role as a facilitator; and\n\u0002 course design for guidance and student support.\nThe student perspective on each of these is considered below, with the addition of\nsome lasting impressions of the overall experience of online learning taken from the\ndiaries and the survey. As the inclusion of all responses would take up too much\nspace, a selection indicating the overall directions of the comments is included. For\neach comment the source, the reflective diaries, the survey, or the focus group, is indi-\ncated in brackets.\nCourse design around open-ended, real-world problems\nWhile this is an important issue, it did not elicit a wide range of student comments.\nIt is likely that the students commented mainly on the experience of dealing with the\nproblems, which is covered under the next topic of group problem-solving, rather\nthan the nature of the problem tasks. Some comments on the nature of the learning\ntasks are: \nCourses I enjoyed the most were those that included regular amounts of small assessment\nor regular activities, this ensured that I logged into the course regularly. This may not be\na fault of the course but does help keep students involved with the online course. (Survey)\n 154\n \nI. McAlpine\n         the assignments \u2026 were interesting and motivating\u2014due to being \u2018real life\u2019 authentic\ntasks, with real contexts. (Survey)\nthe tasks all promoted learning and I felt I learned a lot both pedagogically and technically.\n(Survey)\nHave just completed the first assignment which was a well-drafted, authentic task\u2014quite\nenjoyed it and feel at least I have done something! (Reflective Diary)\nIt appears that the use of real-world problems as a focus of the learning activities was\nvalued. Additional perspectives on the nature of the experience are given in the next\nsection.\nGroup problem-solving\nThe process of learning from group tasks drew a wide range of comments. This issue,\nmore than any other, seemed to attract the students\u2019 attention. Opinions were polar-\nized, with the students tending to either like it or hate it, depending upon the experi-\nence. A student from the focus group, who had completed several subjects online\nsaid: \nYes it was good\u2014nothing will ever replace sitting in a room with people and talking to\nthem but to do the group work \u2026 (online)\u2014you certainly got to know the group members\nmuch better and you interacted with their thoughts and ideas and that\u2019s the way you\nlearned.\nSome comments indicate positive experiences: \nI teamed up with a chap from New Zealand and I found that enjoyable as we worked well\ntogether. It was good to have that level of collaboration and I was pleased with the assign-\nment tasks we did. (Survey)\nOnce we worked out who could do things during the week and who could do things on\nweekends then everyone was comfortable with that you could then share the work so that\nit was easy and it worked well once you worked that out - but working out the logistics\noften took the time\u2014once the logistics were worked out then it flowed pretty well. (Focus\nGroup)\nCollaboration was useful for accomplishing a task\u2014discussions were actually carried out\nby three one-hour telephone conferences (Focus Group)\nWe tended to find though that a couple of telephone calls we\u2019d organize it quicker than\nwith the chat systems\u2014our group got particularly well organized for that particular session\n\u2026 it then proceeded to run extremely well in pushing our assignments forward. (Focus\nGroup)\nOne respondent commenced a course using a collaborative approach and was\nasked, during the course, to change to individual work. The reflective diary\nresponse was: \nI think the course has lost a lot because of the loss of collaboration. It actually took an extra\neffort to work like that but the learning should have been better. It is now easier just to do\nmy own thing and not worry about any body else or have to incorporate anyone else\u2019s\npoints of view.\n Course developers as students\n \n155\n         The respondent\u2019s solution was to substitute work colleagues for fellow students: \nI actually talk about the topic tasks with people here at work and receive comments and\nsuggestions from them prior to and whilst doing the task. I find it very useful to consult\nwith my colleagues to help consolidate and formulate my ideas. It\u2019s good reflection stuff.\nI am using my work colleagues in lieu of my classmates to discuss the coursework.\nIn general, the responses relating to collaborative work were positive. One student,\nhowever, points out some associated stresses: \nIt\u2019s quite positive the experience but you can overdo the group stuff too because I found\nthe group stuff quite time consuming so whilst I agree that yes it\u2019s valuable and yes we did\nwork out how to do it more effectively as we went along, having to do group stuff so often\nwith so many units in a year when a lot of us travel away from our places of work, etc., etc.,\nmy judgement is \u2018yes if you ask me I\u2019d say continue with it but let\u2019s not do it at every oppor-\ntunity\u2014let\u2019s be strategic about when you choose for us to do group work \u2026 (Focus Group)\nCollaborative tasks can cause major problems if students are not motivated to work\ntogether, as these responses indicate: \nThe collaborative task isn\u2019t going well. The person has disappeared. He sent me an email\nyesterday (four days after my initial one) which shows he isn\u2019t clear about the task and\nclearly hasn\u2019t started any work on it. I really need to get on with it as I can\u2019t extend my\ndeadline \u2026 so I feel a real sense of urgency. I don\u2019t think this is a great task to collaborate\non. I find collaborating with someone I don\u2019t know really uncomfortable. Mason and\nWeller (2000) suggest I do Task 2 alone given the problems with collaborating\u2026 (Reflec-\ntive diary)\nThere\u2019s a major problem with group work if you can\u2019t get the cooperation of one person\n\u2026 (Focus Group)\nThe courses that are the focus of these comments clearly made use of group tasks as\nan important part of the course design. When this process works well, students appear\nto find it rewarding, leading to the intended outcome of learning to work as a team,\nsharing ideas among the group, and a deeper understanding of the topic. This\noutcome certainly isn\u2019t guaranteed however, as collaboration can go awry very easily\nif some members of a group do not contribute effectively to the process. Group\nprocesses may also place additional stress on the group members, and could be over-\ndone in some situations.\nDeveloping a learning community\nWhile some students appeared to enjoy the process of group work online more than\nothers, the sense of being a part of a learning community did not figure in the\ncomments. If the group process worked that was fine, but the community aspect or\nsense of belonging to a group only elicited comments when its absence was particu-\nlarly felt, as is seen by the following: \nI would have preferred \u2018traditional\u2019 face -to-face interaction. I found the lack of being part\nof a \u2018real\u2019 learning community frustrating and the on-line set up didn\u2019t compensate.\n(Survey)\n 156\n \nI. McAlpine\n        \u2026 the feelings of isolation and not really feeling part of a class\u2014I never got to know anyone\nother that the tutor (whom I got to know very well)\u2014while we were invited to contribute\nto discussion forums etc, I felt we needed more structure to \u2018force\u2019 us to engage with each\nother. (Survey)\nTo work in a team when you don\u2019t know what people look like is a bit strange to start with.\n(Focus Group)\n\u2026 still no attempt to \u2018pull together a class\u2019\u2014I have no feeling whatsoever of actually study-\ning a subject. (Reflective Diary)\nStudents who experienced success with group processes may have felt a sense of a\nlearning community, evidenced by their satisfaction in working together. This could\nbe considered to be a part of the group learning process rather than a separate issue.\nIt has been considered separately in this study because of some literature that focuses\non this issue directly, and also because of the strength of the students\u2019 comments.\nThis issue may also overlap with the next sections on the role of the tutor and the\ncourse design, as these may influence the perception of belonging to a learning\ncommunity.\nThe tutor\u2019s role as a facilitator\nThe role of the tutor in an online course may be critical to the degree of success. As\nstudents are both isolated and probably coping with a new approach to learning and\nnew technology, they naturally look to the tutor to provide a positive input. It appears\nthat if this doesn\u2019t happen, perhaps because the tutor holds the belief that the students\nwill work things out for themselves, then the students may experience some concerns.\nSome comments reflect this: \n\u2026 there was never any real \u2018start\u2019 to the course where we all had to do something together\nand therefore to find out who else was studying. (Survey)\nthe person running the course did not make much of an effective contribution. (Survey)\nMy worst experience was my first online course, the lecturer was very absent from the course,\nemail did not get answered for a considerable period of time, the bulletin board was empty\nand many students complained about a feeling of being lost in the course. (Survey)\nThe tutor\u2019s role, however, can be seen to be very effective: \n\u2026 the level of tutor support, feedback and responsiveness (and flexibility) \u2026 was\nextremely high. (Survey)\nVery much appreciated [the tutor\u2019s] response (via email). A positive aspect of the work so\nfar is (the tutor\u2019s) openness to feedback and responsiveness to issues raised. I\u2019ve realized\nthat one advantage of online learning is that the teacher can respond rapidly to issues\/\nconcerns and let everyone know outcomes immediately. (Reflective diary)\nThe critical issue for the tutor appears to be the degree of involvement in the online\ndiscussions. Moderating these discussions can be seen as a new skill, about which a\nbody of research is emerging that is leading to a range of guidelines such as those in\nSalmon (2000, 2002).\n Course developers as students\n \n157\n         Course design for guidance and student support\nRespondents were strongly negative about situations in which there did not appear\nto be an appropriate level of guidance, or \u2018scaffolding\u2019. When the way to use the\nonline materials was not clear, this led to high levels of frustration and confusion: \nThere is no place to go to \u2018get started\u2019 which tells us how we are going to work together,\nwhat we will do, etc. (Reflective Diary)\nInterface design\u2014irrelevant metaphors; distributed information on any one topic, espe-\ncially assessment; spurious labelling, e.g. weekly tasks under either \u2018computer laboratory\u2019\nor \u2018lecture theatre\u2019. (Reflective Diary)\nWhat does a discussion forum need to be student centred? It needs to be easily accessible,\neasy to read messages in a threaded format, easy to post replies to any particular author,\nand easy to post a new question (i.e. start a new thread). Several of these student centred\nattributes are missing from the current forum. (Reflective diary)\nThe final assessment was poorly \u2018scaffolded\u2019 for students \u2026 i.e. no preparation \u2026 and\nseemed to be on a different topic to the course. (Survey)\nIt came as a big shock in about week 5 to discover a large assessment task worth 30%\nof the course was due imminently. I was working on the assumption that the submis-\nsions of the 2 weekly tasks \u2026 was the assessment for the course. I now understand that\nthese tasks (many of which involve considerable time and effort) are only worth 30% of\nthe course. This is disproportionate to the effort required \u2026 I should have been more\nstrategic: work out where the big value tasks are and work on those. (Reflective Diary)\nThe data do not contain balancing comments of a positive nature about course\ndesign, scaffolding and guidance issues. Perhaps it can be considered that if the\nstudents are satisfied then the course design is good as it does not confront the student\nwith any problems so they can concentrate upon the learning tasks. When the design\nleaves students confused or with a sense of no direction, as the above comments seem\nto indicate, then there appear to be shortcomings that need to be addressed. The\nabove comments are mostly from reflective diaries, indicating a sense of frustration\nemerging from course design that did not seem to provide a clear path for the students\nto follow.\nLasting impressions\nWhat was the verdict at the end of the course? Some students were left with a bad\nimpression of online study, because a particular course was poorly managed or didn\u2019t\nwork for them: \nRemains nearly 6 months later overwhelmingly negative. Both of the course, the \u2018flexible\ndelivery\u2019 mode and the school involved. (Survey)\nFor one respondent, the lasting impression is: \nWhat I learned from the tasks and also that scaffolding is very important in the implemen-\ntation of an online course. Its importance is paramount. (Survey)\n 158\n \nI. McAlpine\n                    Fortunately, despite the inevitable problems or hurdles, most of the respondents had\npositive comments about the overall experience of studying online. An example of\nlasting impressions tells a more favourable story: \nOverall I\u2019ve enjoyed studying online, I have now completed five masters level papers\nonline over the past three years. Not surprisingly, online courses are greatly effected by\nthe abilities of the teaching staff running the course, perhaps even more so than face-to-\nface classes.\nFlexibility! Since starting my online Masters course I have shifted countries, if I had started\na traditional Masters program it would have been much more difficult to continue study-\ning. I was also able to continue with my studying while travelling.\nThe other thing I enjoy about online courses are lecturers who are responsive, I\u2019ve experi-\nence some very good online lecturers who have been very responsive but have also let\nstudents time to interact with each other and discuss issues. Feedback from the online\nteacher was perhaps the biggest factor effecting my reaction to the course, as well as the\namount of interaction happening in the bulletin board. (Survey)\nDiscussion\nThe project reported here, set out to answer the following questions: \n\u0002 What elements of the design of online learning courses contribute to effective\noutcomes?\n\u0002 What can the experience of online learning contribute to the improvement of\nonline course design?\nIn considering the extent to which these questions have been answered, the discussion\nwill focus on the five themes of: \n\u0002 Course design around open-ended, real-world problems.\n\u0002 Group problem-solving.\n\u0002 Developing a learning community.\n\u0002 The tutor\u2019s role as a facilitator.\n\u0002 Course design for guidance and student support.\nCourse design around open-ended, real-world problems\nThe first key course design element is a constructivist approach of using problem or\ncase based, real-world scenarios as a focus for the learning process (Oliver & Omari,\n1999). This approach was used to some extent by most of the online courses included\nin the data gathering process. Several courses made group problem-solving a central\npart of the course design. While the nature of the task did not elicit many comments\n(unlike the actual group process) the nature of the comments indicated that the\nstudents appreciated the authentic tasks.\n Course developers as students\n \n159\n        Group problem-solving\nThe next key design element is that learning from problem or case based scenarios\nshould be a group process (Oliver & Omari, 1999; McAlpine, 2000; Minasian-\nBatmanian et al., 2000). This aspect of design elicited mostly positive comments,\nalthough there were situations in which the group process didn\u2019t work, which led to\nhigh levels of frustration. One important factor evident from the focus group is that it\ntakes time to develop the necessary capability to work as a group online. The students\nhad completed several courses online and knew most of the other participants well,\nand had learned to work this way. The respondents who experienced frustration were\nnew to the experience of online group work, and often found that the people they were\nsupposed to work with were not active in the process. Comments indicate that the\nrespondents regretted losing the opportunity to collaborate online. It appears that\nsome students had enrolled in the course but failed to participate in an effective way,\ndespite this being a course requirement. This suggests that additional management\nprocesses may be required to kickstart the group process. Salmon (2000) suggests a\nrange of activities, including easy introductory activities, to involve the students in\ntasks that are easily manageable before asking them to engage in a group task online,\nwhich is complex and demanding. The students in the focus group were brought\ntogether for an intensive week\u2019s study before starting the online courses, so they\nwould know each other and clearly understand the importance of online group work.\nIt is likely that tutor follow-up is needed if individuals do not contribute effectively.\nDeveloping a learning community\nThe third key design element is the development of learning community. It is\nsuggested that a learning community or community of practice is critical in dealing\nwith complex open-ended tasks using a constructivist approach (Johnson, 2001). The\nrespondents do not use language that would indicate they experienced a sense of\ncommunity; however, negative comments made it clear that some students were look-\ning for this and didn\u2019t find it. One comment made clear that the provision of a discus-\nsion forum did not mean that people would use it, and using the discussion should be\na requirement of the course. The student feedback indicates specific needs, to have a\nsense of belonging to a group, that were not met. This raises questions about how this\ncan be done. Clearly the use of the online discussion should be a requirement for\ncourse participants, possibly as an assessed activity. An optional activity may not\nengage most of the students, who will naturally focus on what they are required to do.\nThe answers to this issue may overlap with the previous aspect of group work and the\nfollowing aspect related to the tutor\u2019s role.\nThe tutor\u2019s role as a facilitator\nThe role of the online tutor is the next key design element. Palloff and Pratt (1999)\nsuggest a range of proactive tutor activities including posting instructions and expec-\ntations and using dialogue as a process of inquiry. A broader range of tutor activities\n 160\n \nI. McAlpine\n      is provided by Salmon (2000). Feedback on this issue is clear cut. Some comments\nindicate that the tutor was largely absent from the online course and so no activities\nwere undertaken that would facilitate engagement by the students. These comments\nindicate considerable frustration at the lack of tutor involvement. By contrast other\ncomments indicate strong appreciation of the tutor\u2019s willingness to respond and\nprovide support. This suggests that tutors need to learn appropriate techniques for\nmoderating online discussions.\nCourse design for guidance and student support\nThe final design element, course design for guidance and student support, seemed\nto create many issues for the students. This is a critical element that is a mix of the\nway the online courseware is designed to provide navigation, the presence of\nappropriate student guides within the coursework, and the way that the course is\nmanaged by the tutor. Brunetto et al. (1999) suggest that this element is not well\ndone in many online courses. Hannafin et al. (1999) propose several aspects of\nguidance or scaffolding required. These include procedural, conceptual, metacog-\nnitive and strategic aspects relating to the learning tasks, for which different forms\nof guidance may be needed. Student feedback indicates some dissatisfaction with\nthis aspect of course design. Most of the issues seem to revolve around procedural\nmatters rather than the conceptual material. This referred to difficulties in navigat-\ning the coursework and knowing what the assessment tasks were and where they\nwere to be found. Confusion through lack of guidance or difficult navigation\ncaused apparent frustration that may have influenced the student\u2019s attitude to the\ncourse overall. This may involve a careful consideration of basic aspects of online\ncourseware design to avoid these problems.\nThese design elements all appear to be important elements that contribute to an\neffective online course. The student perspective highlights the major issues for devel-\nopers to focus on, to ensure that the course is effective.\nConclusions\nIn this study the student perspective on course design has been used to illuminate\nsome of the strengths and weaknesses of learning and teaching online. The\nconstructive approach to course delivery was used as a tool to interpret and anal-\nyse the student experience and perspective. This approach has revealed that for the\nrange of online courses included in this project, the most notable weaknesses were\nsupport for group processes, building a learning community, and courseware\ndesign to facilitate student access to all relevant components and information.\nThese can be seen as issues relating to a fundamental aspect of course design, how\nlearning and teaching is going to work for the learner, and secondly to aspects of\nscaffolding and student support to reinforce the learning and teaching process.\nThe five key design elements all seem to be critical to the development and imple-\nmentation of an online course that will foster high-level learning outcomes.\nCourse developers as students 161Furthermore, by enrolling in online courses as students, course designers have\ngained a useful insight into where the emphasis needs to be placed to improve the\neffectiveness of online courses.\nReferences\nBrookfield, S.
