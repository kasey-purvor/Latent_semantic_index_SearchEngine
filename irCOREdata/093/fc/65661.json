Many everyday objects \nnow embed computer processing power, while other are activated by passing \nprocessors. The distributed processing in the world around us is often claimed to be  a \npervasive or ubiquitous computing environment. A world of ambient intelligence, \nhappening around us on the periphery of our awareness, where our environment is not a \npassive backdrop but an active agent in organising daily lives. The spaces around us are \nnow being continually forged and reforged in informational and communicative \nprocesses. It is a world where we not only think of cities but cities think of us, where the \nenvironment reflexively monitors our behaviour. This paper suggests we need to unpack \nthe embedded politics of this process. It outlines the key dynamics in terms of \nenvironments that learn and possess anticipation and memory. To examine the \nassumptions and implications behind this the paper takes three contrasting visions of \n\u2017sentient\u2018 urban environments. The first addresses market led visions of customised \nconsumer worlds. The second explores military plans for profiling and targeting. Finally, \nthe third looks at artistic endeavours to re-enchant and contest the urban informational \nlandscape of urban sentience. Each we suggest shows a powerful dynamic of the \nenvironment tracking, predicting and recalling usage. \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe 1990s have been characterised as the decade of the virtual (Manovich 2006). \nInformation and communication studies were preoccupied with notions of a \ndematerialisation and refiguration of identity. A great deal of both utopian and dystopian \nwriting focused upon the alleged transcendence or loss of physicality and its \nreplacement with new spaces and fora online (Graham, 2004). It has become a well \nestablished critique to point out that, far from forming an even and seamless electronic \nrealm, there is a structure and geography to informational worlds. Thus, much writing \nhas pointed to the persistence of divides in infrastructure and capacity, indeed the \nconcentration of capacities and capitalisation on location in new technology clusters and \ndevelopments both in terms of connectivity (see for example Zook 2002) and social \nmilieu that if anything become more vital for media knowledge workers (see for example \nPratt 2002). Confining informational space to some \u2017global space of flows\u2018 that is \u2017out \nthere,\u2018 as Castells\u2018 (1996) influential work does, also has stark limits, in part because it \nimplies an equation of the human with the near and local, the slow and the small (Thrift \n2004: 54). This seems problematic when these transnational flows are actually deeply \nembedded in ways that mean that many \u2017urban residents begin to experience the \u2017local\u2018 \nas a type of microenvironment with global span\u2018 (Sassen 2006: 23). The relationship and \neffect on place of accelerated mobile information is thus dialectical. As Sassen puts it:  \n\u2017much of what is liquefied and circulates in digital networks and is marked by \nhypermobility, actually remains physical \u2013 and hence possibly urban \u2013 in \nsome of its components. At the same time, however, that which remains \nphysical has been transformed by the fact that that is represented by highly \nliquid instruments that can circulate in global markets\u2018 (Sassen 2006: 24).  \n \nWhat happens to places and people in networked environments where small \ninformational devices and data are brought together \u2013 repeatedly, in real-time, and \nautomatically, through systems that sink into the urban background? This paper \nattempts to outline some of the possibilities which open up when the city becomes a \nhaze of software as much as being bricks and mortar (Amin and Thrift 2002). It follows \nWeiser\u2018s famous dictum that  \u2015the most profound technologies are those that disappear. \nThey weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable \nfrom it\u2016 (Weiser 1991: 1). Instead of a story of the substitution of electronic media for \nphysical encounter, then, we want to build an account of the permeation of the daily \nenvironment with communication technologies in  \u2017a space in which the public is \nreconfigured by a multitude of media and communication networks interwoven into the \nsocial and political functions of space to form a \u2015hybrid space\u2016\u2018 (Kluitenberg 2006: 8).  \n \nIn this paper we particularly want to explore some of the political implications of the \nembedding of computing into the background environments of cities. We also want to \npay attention to the wider urban and technological  imaginaries that surround this \nprocess. Our particular focus here is on what are often termed pervasive computing or \nubiquitous computing ( the so-called \u2017ubicomp\u2018). Building on previous work that looks at \nthe informational overcoding of environments, usually via geodemographic data, in \ncomplex and recursive fashions, we suggest that the interaction of data and processing \nproduce new patterns of stratification (see for example Burrows and Ellison 2004; \nBurrows and Gane 2006).  \n \nIn what follows we explore three key contemporary domains within which the \nreconfiguration of cities and their politics are being actively imagined and enacted. This \nis going on, we suggest, through the production and dissemination of technological \nfantasies, the more practical processes of technological development, and the actual \ndeployment of, and contestation over, operational ubicomp systems. These three \nvignettes address commercial fantasies of \u2017friction-free\u2018 urban consumption; military and \nsecurity industry attempts to mobilise ubiquitous computing to the \u2017war on terror\u2018; and \nattempts by artists to interrupt fantasies of perfect urban control through artistic use of \nnew ubicomp technologies to try and re-enchant urban space and urban life. Before \naddressing these three areas in turn, however, it is necessary to take a brief conceptual \nexcursion into the complex political and analytical challenges raised by the shift to urban \nworlds which are continually ordered, animated and brought into being by interlinked \ncomputerised systems, which blend seamlessly into the urban background. \n \nPromises and Dreams of Ubiquitous Computing \n \nUrban ubiquitous computing systems entwine people, place and software in complex \nways. Software and algorithms code people, places and their data in interrelated \nsystems that are then used to profile and drive decision making systems. This raises a \nkey question: What happens when the processing and not just the data is embedded in \nthe everyday environment?  \n \nThe rising concern with the embedding of software in the environment marks a notable \nshift from much critical writing of the nineties that focused upon the screen sometimes as \na space in its own right, but more often as a barrier or impediment to encountering the \nworld (Friedberg 1993, Graham, 2005). Instead, debate has moved \u2017toward embedding \ninformation technology into the ambient social complexities of the physical world\u2018 \n(McCullough 2004: ix). In a world of pervasive or ubiquitous computing, lingering \nassumptions about processing being conducted in offices and in discrete artefacts called \ncomputers may well obscure rapidly developing processes. Already, less than a quarter \nof chips produced by Intel are destined for desk-top computers  (McCullough 2004: 5) \nand for many young Japanese the permanent networked capacity of DoCoMo ketai (i-\nmode standard cell phones) is their first, and most common, way of being \u2017on-line\u2018 (de \nSouza e Silva 2006: 263).  \n \nTo clarify some of the dimensions that concern us here, it is useful to develop a \ntypological conceptualisation of the  multiple  ways in which urban environments might \nbecome animated through ubiquitous computing systems hidden in the background of \nthe city. We would point to four distinct but related possibilities or approaches here. \n \nAugmenting Space \n \nThe first approach points out that the built environment has been saturated with \ninformation for centuries \u2013 from signage to adverts. Indeed these literally overwhelmed \nvarious spaces \u2013 not just the high iconography of ceremonial sites but looking at the \nordnances in London periodically, and by implication with only moderate success, \nlimiting shop boards that threatened to physically block traffic (Ackroyd 2001). The \noverlaying of new electronic media produces a less stable topography, that is both \nuneven and in ceaseless flux (Kluitenberg 2006: 8). The oft-heralded version of this is \n\u2017augmented reality\u2018 which attempts to \u2017overlay physical objects with virtual objects in \nreal-time and allows people to experience the virtual as if it were real\u2018 (Galloway 2004: \n390) and has generally aimed to allow  the user to \u2017see the \u2015real\u2016 world with overlaid \ngraphical data\u2018 (de Souza e Silva 2006: 264).  \n \nThe significant shift to \u2017augmented space\u2018 is overlaying physical space with dynamically \nchanging information, multimedia in form and localized for each user where the data \nforms an always connected, pervasive environment rather than necessarily appearing in \nour field of vision (Manovich 2006: 220). The novelty is the real time alteration of the \ndata, the convergence of different forms of access and its personalisation.  The screen is \nmobilized and goes traveling, becoming embedded in our environment rather than \nseparating us from it. The term augmentation in that sense reflects media adding to our \nexperiential world not taking it over (p225). It speaks a language of enhancement and \nnew capacities, alongside a sensible recognition of incremental rather than epochal \nchanges.  \n \nEnacting Space \n \nThe vision of augmented spaces tends to produce a sense of superimposed but passive \nenvironments \u2013 the emphasis is on the different spaces rather than the activity. So for a \ndifferent, second, emphasis we might turn to Dana Cuff\u2018s depiction of the city as now \nmade of \u2017Cyburgs\u2018 which are \u2017spatially embodied computing, or an environment \nsaturated with computing capability. It is the imminent stage of digital media that places \ncomputation in all things around us, from our own skin and bodies (biotechnology and \nnanotech medication), to our clothing, to our cars, our streets, our homes, and our \nwildernesses\u2018 (Cuff 2003: 44).  \n \nIn enacted space, the computer moves to inhabit the most ordinary of things to produce \nan \u2017enacted environment\u2018. She suggests that while it is an enhancement of our \ncapacities it relocates agency into the world: \n\u2017Our own agency is enhanced by the cyburg, for we can know and act in \nmore powerful ways. Complementing our empowerment is the newly \nenacted environment. Not only do the walls have ears, but networks of \neyes, brains, and data banks to use for purposeful action. Although we \nare reluctant to attribute agency to objects in our surroundings, it is a \nstance that won\u2018t survive long\u2018 (Cuff 2003: 44) \n \nTransducting Space \n \nThis suggests that we need to think through the technological agency of ubiquitous \ncomputing more carefully. And here our third strand of approaches may help. Leaning on \nthe work of Simonden and others it focuses on capacities such as technicity (the \nproductive power of technology to make things happen) and transduction (the constant \nmaking anew of a domain in reiterative and transformative practices) (Dodge and Kitchin \n2005: 162). This moves perhaps to a more functional and instrumental understanding of \ntechnologies \u2013 or rather to see that they are most often used for these ends. This study \nfocuses upon the \u2017coding\u2018 of people, places and objects \u2013 that is processes of \nidentification and then the layering and cross-referring of these identifications through \nsoftware algorithms. Thus it about how codes offer modes of address \u2013 both locating \nand hailing people and things. Thrift goes so far as to suggest this forms a \u2017technological \nunconscious\u2018 through \u2017the bending of bodies-with-environments to a specific set of \naddresses without the benefit of any cognitive inputs, a prepersonal substrate of \nguaranteed correlations, assured encounters, and therefore unconsidered anticipations\u2018 \n(Thrift 2004: 177). \n The focus on how this enables action leads Dodge and Kitchin (2004: 198) to distinguish \n\u2017coded space\u2018, where information is inscribed digitally that enhances the functioning of a \nparticular environment, and \u2017code\/space\u2018, where information and space are so fused that \nthe space cannot function without the information and there is no uncoded, manual \nalternative. In part the enhanced \u2017technicity\u2018 these environments offer comes down to \ncoded objects being networked, through more codes and these enabling coded \nprocesses to organize new forms of action (transduction) (Dodge and Kitchin 2005).  \n \n\u2017Blogject\u2018 Space \n \nFinally, such an approach might also lead us to Bleecker\u2018s (2006) notion of the \u2017blogject\u2018: \nan artifact that develops data through tracings its use or movement. In this he takes \nforward the notion of the \u2017Internet of Things\u2018 Internet of Things from \u2017a nascent \nconceptual framework for understanding how physical objects, once networked and \nimbued with informatic capabilities, will occupy space and occupy themselves in a world \nin which things were once quite passive\u2018 to one that sees things as fully agentive players \n(Bleecker 2006: 1-2). Thus blogjects move from artefacts which are coded to hold data \nlocally but can be connected to wider systems by users, to those who communicate \nthemselves among a limited system without user intervention and rhizomic blogjects that \ndepend upon a network to function by developing and storing data off site. The focus is \nupon a form of agency for these objects. Thus: \n\u2017Agency as I am using it here does not just mean a local \u2015artificial \nintelligence\u2016 that makes a Blogject able to make autonomous, human-\nlike decision or fashion croaky human-speech from text. Blogjects have \nno truck with the syntax of human thought. Things could not care any \nless about their Turing Test report card. Blogject intellect is their ability \nto effect change. Their agency attains through the consequence of their \nassertions, and through the significant perspective they deliver to \nmeaningful conversations. (Bleecker 2006: 9) \n \nIn other words, \u2017blogject\u2018 space is about reformulating agentive properties that \ntransverse the object-subject border. The environment acts, as it always did, but now \nwith software code as a medium.  \n In this appaoach, we move to active sense of coding as about making places happen \u2013 \nnot in specific or discrete moments but continually. This means seeing that \u2017spaces \ndepend upon the gradual construction of complex ethologies of bodies and objects, \nwhich are repositories of the \u2017correct\u2018 positionings and juxtapositionings that allow things \nto arrive and become known \u2026 the modest but constant hum of connection and \ninterconnection that they make possible\u2018 (Thrift 2004: 175). This is an ontogenetic \nunderstanding of space which sees it as continually being brought into existence through \neveryday transductive practices (Dodge and Kitchin 2005: 162). Technologies are \neveryday events which involve spatialization, temporalization and embodiment \nsimultaneously (Galloway 2004: 404-5). \n \nWith such a perspective established we can now turn to our three explorations of key \nareas of urban ubiquitous computing: fantasies of \u2017friction free\u2018 urban consumption; \ndreams of  securitised urban ominiscience surrounding the \u2017war on terror; and the efforts \nof artists to imagine very different dynamics of urban ubiquitous computing. \n \nFantasies of Friction-Free Consumption \n \nLocating consumers \n \nThe notion of active and learning spaces has long been touted in terms of the possibility \nfor a customised consumer paradise where goods can be found on demand \u2013 or, even \nbetter, before we realised we needed them. A variety of technologies build up profiles of \npreferences \u2017memorising\u2018 our actions in places. Past patterns of purchase no longer \nneed to be manually \u2017bookmarked\u2018 but form self-generated \u2017favourites\u2018 lists of goods \nregularly purchased (for instance in online supermarkets) and from thence it is but a \nshort step to the lists of \u2017suggestions\u2018 compiled from those preferences (as in Amazon or \nmany e-tailers). If online stores can remember their visitors, the possibilities of tags and \ncoding mean \u2017real\u2018 stores and locations might also do so. In that sense spaces begin to \nhave both a memory and anticipation of uses. Thus a shop might read an RFID in a \nmobile phone and produce a customised list of favourite or usual services or alert a \nspecific member of staff. It is in effect \u2017projecting the interactive model of cyberspace \nback into physical space. The metaphor of cyberspace has, in other words, come full \ncircle\u2018 (Andrejevic 2003: 134). Location starts to organise the interaction. Firstly, spatial \ndatabases allow the selection of services based on location or proximity criteria. \nSecondly, mobile media offer the possibility of centring such searches on the current \nlocation of the user. In some senses, it is what is so common with mobile phones \u2013 \npeople coordinating their lives through frequent exchanges about their location (Laurier \n2001). Geolocation technologies take this further and offer the possibility of devices \nautomatically knowing where they are (receiving locative data) or saying where they are \n(transmitting it) or both.  \n \nSearching tailored to location has been hailed as the \u2017killer app\u2018 for mobile network \ndevices enabling a \u2017data-driven mass customization based on continuous, real-time \nmonitoring of consumers\u2018 (ibid.: 133). Except it has been hailed so often that it might \nmake one wary of why it has not yet caught on (Sweeting 2005). There are technical \nissues in learning and responding to the preferences of consumers -- just imagine the \nawful moment of Microsoft\u2018s office assistant (\u2017Hi! You appear to be writing a letter\u2026\u2018) \nloosed upon the planet (\u2017Hi! You appear to be near our shop\u2026\u2018) (McCullough 2004: 15).  \nEqually,  while mobile phones may carve the city up into \u2017cellspace\u2018 (Manovich 2006), \nthese vary in size and signal triangulation is complex allowing only rough approximations \nfor location, and, while satellite positioning systems are becoming common, they are by \nno means universal in either reception or embedding in devices. More crucially, the \ncommercial logics of who would provide spatially referenced data on providers, who \nwould provide it about users, who would make devices produce this data and who would \nwork out the middleware to translate all these codings and who would profit from this \nhave so far stymied many attempts. The technology exists, though it is not seamless, but \nthe business model or operation is less solid. \n \nThe promises though are large and better than just finding a shoe shop when and where \nyou need one. We might look at the possibilities for traffic organisation and trip sharing \nschemes. The car pool is an oft touted element in environmental policies for reducing \ntraffic. So far larger scale initiatives have often been thwarted by the lack of trust among \nlarge groups of unacquainted users and the complexities of coordinating large numbers \nof movements between different starting and end points at different times via different \nroutes, with varying traffic conditions, subject to changes of demand at short notice. So \nmost commercial providers work by either restricting the routes and set down and pick \nup points (the \u2017bus solution\u2018) or demanding advanced planning. However geolocation \ntechnology and geosensors offer the possibility of changing this. Rather than a vast \ncentral data base, an augmented informational landscape would continually provide data \non the location and direction of vehicles, that could be picked up and sorted by those \nwith receivers wishing to travel. Distributed sensors and computing would make it a \ncollaborative task through ad hoc automated peer to peer communication (Winter and \nNittel 2006).i It offers the prospect of something like an electronic thumb for the twenty \nfirst century. Of course, it does not build trust in other users in and of itself  -- that might \nentail another coding and sorting of people with different implications. \n \nTracking objects through the world \n \nThese locative technologies all seem a long way from the heady proclamations of the \ndot.com boom that all commerce would move online. The effect of code has been the \nproduction of bricks\u2018n\u2018clicks assemblages of electronic and material provision in this \naugmented landscape. Corporations rely upon connecting demands through to supply \nchains and as more commerce of all sorts entails lengthening supply chains of \nincreasing complexity, it is not just e-tailers that are deploying ever more sophisticated \nmeans of tracing their inventory. The smooth flow of goods in response to demand has \nbecome a key issue for global capital whether the customer request is initially electronic \nor whether the firm translates it into one. In this climate we can see the rise of \ntechnologies such as the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip. The various types \nof this device can be attached to just about anything and used to record or code its \nidentity. More expensive variants allow this data to be modified to record the handling \nand processing of an object, and while the majority are \u2017passive\u2018 devices and wait until a \nreader comes within a few metres, some others are powered and actively broadcast \ninformation. For large corporations and logistical companies \u2017RFID is a dream come true; \na dream of controllability, transparency and efficiency as regards the worldwide tracing \nof goods\u2018 (Kluitenbrouwer 2006: 51).  \n \nIf we take the RFID chips that allow recording these create objects with memories, or \nindeed to become networked \u2017blogjects\u2018, that may be connected up and called forth to \ncompose a life log (Dodge and Kitchin 2007). Thus pervasive environments may \nproduce seamless data trails across a number of devices. We thus have a combination \nof: \n\u2017technologies [that] constitute \u2017history-enriched\u2018 digital objects that can \nproduce autobiographical traces some of which objects are supplemented \nwith profiling programmes that adapt them to personal preferences (eg, \nautomatic interface customisation, predictive texting on mobile phones, etc) \nand thus learn or build in anticipation as well as memory. These automated \nforms of datalogging and personalization are being complemented by \ntechnologies for the conscious self-creation and public sharing of these \npersonal material, for example, through blogging and webcams\u2018 (Dodge and \nKitchin 2007: 434).  \n \nThere are then clearly issues of who accesses and controls this assemblage of data. \nIndeed, the issue would seem to be not one of blanket privacy but control over \ninterchange of information where people want the benefits of tailored products but to do \nthis by selecting which information is given and received to and from whom \n(Kluitenbrouwer 2006).  \n \nOne project currently being trialled that might illustrate this is the Windows Mobile \napplication AURA launched in December 2006. The acronym stands for Advanced User \nResource Annotation and it aims to \u2017connect shoppers on the go to a world of \ninformation about products\u2018 (MS press release). It depends upon objects being \u2017coded\u2018 in \nthis case with a bar code. The technology means that with an AURA-enabled device you \ncan use a digital camera to snap the bar code on a product, which it will relate to the \ndatabase held by Microsoft and will return links and search results about the item to the \nhandheld device. Initially this could be as simple as an on-the-go product price \ncomparison service but Microsoft hopes everyday users would eventually augment the \ninformation AURA delivers by posting reviews and other details about things they buy or \nown. Microsoft\u2018s in house anthropologist Marc Smith argued previous applications failed \nbecause people weren't regularly carrying portable devices with the processing power, \nwireless connectivity and cameras to make such a service feasible and easy. He sets \nAURA in the context of social software:  \"Now we have to ask ourselves, what's the \nsocial application, what's going to happen when millions of people have these devices?\" \nand thus what it offers is \"a little taste of what the future be like when you can walk up to \nany device and interrogate it and annotate it\" (Smith 2006).  \n \nConversely, objects you cannot code become mute. Already a scheme ThingLink \n(Kluitenbrouwer 2006: 55-6) aims to help handicraft producers to give any object a digital \nreference on an online database to make them visible to Google and other e-commerce \nportals. In other words things which are not coded start to become literally dumb. And \namong those uncoded things may well be people. \u2017From the perspective of these \nemergent forms of ambient intelligence, unwired humans will come across as singularly \nunintelligent, non-conversant and incomprehensible\u2018 (Andrejevic 2005: 103). Indeed, the \noverall logic of this \u2017m-commerce\u2018 might be said to be about delegated agency and \nmoving agency away from people \u2013 creating not heightened frenetic communication but \nnew forms of passivity (Andrejevic 2005: 101). The effect though is one where \ndistributed processors increasingly recall our lives, the traces of our movement and use \nthat to anticipate what we might later do. In this we want to suggest here are striking \nparallels with recent plans and developments in the militarization of urban space.   \n \nA \u2018New Manhattan Project\u2019:  Ambient Intelligence and the \u2018War on Terror\u2019 \n \n\u2015The time has come to change the perception that the high-tech US war \nmachine fights at a disadvantage in urban areas\u2016 (Houlgate, 2004). \n \nA second key theme in discussions about the reconfiguration of urban spaces through \nubiquitous computing centres on imperatives of securitization. In particular,  the \nimagination, development and deployment of myriads of new sensing and surveillance \nsystems into city spaces are at the heart of efforts within the so-called \u2017war on terror\u2018 to \nboth securitise western or \u2017homeland\u2018 cities and to counter insurgencies within war-zone \ncities in the colonised frontiers of the global south. In both domains, the key dynamic \ncentres on attempts at rendering complex urban flows and structures permanently \ntransparent to tracking and surveillance systems. In military jargon, cities and the \ncomplex infrastructure grids within and between them, are now deemed to be the central \n\u2017battlespaces\u2018 in which terrorists and insurgents who are largely indistinguishable from \nthe wider urban background and thus can not be easily identified, tracked, or targeted.  \n \n\u2017Identity Dominance\u2018 in \u2017Asymmetric Warfare\u2018 \n \nThe key to this new type of conflict, which profoundly embeds the new \u2017battlespaces\u2018 in \nurban civilian life, is to mobilise ambient intelligence. Embedded in cites and urban \ninfrastructures, to provide the \u2017battlespace awareness\u2018 necessary to identify, track and \ntarget lurking insurgents, terrorists and other \u2017targets,\u2018  and so provide western forces \nwith what John Woodward, of RAND\u2018s Intelligence Policy Centre, calls \u2015Identity \ndominance\u2016 (McCue, 2005).  \n \nThus, military, defence  and surveillance industries are offering ambient technologies \nsuch as RFID tags, algorithmic video cameras, data mining and biometrics as means to \nunveil the logistical, transactional and geographical movements of the human and non-\nhuman \u2017targets\u2018 of the war on terror. Prototype pervasive processors called \u2017Smart dust\u2018 \nwere released in 2001, they were powered by solar energy and able to communicate \nabout the environment they found themselves in, from San Francisco to Berkeley even \nif, at 7mm in length, they were not (yet) wind blown as intended (McCullough 2004: 73). \nThis is being done in a context where the complexity, density, dynamism and scale of \nurban centres are widely deemed by US Defense analysts to undermine the high-\ntechnology advantages of western state militaries. The new military focus is on informal, \nnon-state terrorists and insurgents who blend into the background of the cities, city \nnetworks, and urban infrastructure systems they both choose as the bases for their \nactions, and exploit in their targeting operations. \n \nAn excellent example of the ways in which ambient intelligence technologies are being \nportrayed as central mechanisms through which to wage the \u2017war on terror\u2018 comes from \na major report published by the Pentagon\u2018s Defense Science Board (DSB) In December, \n2004. One of many attempting to draw early military lessons from the urban insurgency \nin Iraq, this report was startling for one reason. It deliberately called for what it called a \n\u2017New Manhattan Project\u2018, invoking the code-name famously used in the 1940s to \ndescribe the massive programme which  developed of first  atom bombs used to \ndevastate Hiroshima and Nagasaki in May1945 (Figure 1). It urged a similar \nconcentration of military resources on what the Board saw as the key strategic priority \nfor the 21st century: the technological unveiling of cities and urban life. Specifically, it \nsaw possibilities to exploit ubiquitous computing technologies in developing a massive, \nintegrated system of  surveillance,  spanning the world, and tailored specifically to \npenetrating the increasing complexity of urban life. Such a system, it argued, would once \nagain render the US military\u2018s targets trackable,  locatable -- and destroyable. The \npurpose of the New \u2015Manhattan project\u2016, then, was seen to be to \u2015locate, identify, and \ntrack, people, things and activities -- in an environment of one in a million -- to give the \nUnited States the same advantages in asymmetric warfare [as] it has today in \nconventional warfare\u2016 (DSB, 2004, 163). Strategically, the ideas of the report have been \ncemented as one of eight principle development areas into the New Pentagon strategy \nfor a \u2017Long War issued in 2005.\u2018 \n \nFIGURE 1 ROUND HERE \n \nThe United State\u2018s hegemonic capabilities for surveilling the earth from the distant, \nvertical domains of air and space were deemed by the DSB  to have \u2015poor capability for \nfinding, identifying and tracking\u2016 what it calls \u2015unconventional war targets\u2016 (DSB, \n2004,153) such as \u2015individuals and insurgent or terrorists groups that operate by \nblending in with the larger society\u2016 (Figure 2).  Crucially, intimate and persistent military \nsurveillance systems were needed which penetrated the details of everyday urban life. \nAs the report put it, little less than  a  comprehensive rescaling of  military imaginations \nof surveillance was needed and \u2015more intimate, terrestrial, 21st century ISR [Intelligence, \nsurveillance and reconnaissance] were required\u2016 (DSB, 2004, 2). The gaze of \nhegemonic military power, the report argued, thus needed colonise not just the planetary \nscales of surveillance; it also needed to penetrate the fine-grained and local geographies \nof urban and infrastructural \u2017battlespaces.\u2018 Such a transformation was imagined to be \nprofoundly temporal as well as geographical. \u2015The surveillance of people, things and \nactivities required to populated the databases needed for identification, location and \ntracking,\u2016 the authors write, \u2015will require a persistence beyond that typical of many of \ntoday\u2018s\u2016 military and security surveillance systems. These new surveillance systems, \nprofoundly local and global at the same time, will, in other words,  need to be \u2017always on\u2018 \n. This will allow them, through \u2015evidence-correlating and backtracking algorithms\u2016  (DSB, \n2004,159) to call upon memories, via databases recording the history of movements and \nassociations of things, activities and people, and anticipate, so that  threatening and \n\u2017abnormal\u2018 behaviours and emergences can be detected and dealt with before the point \nof terrorist or insurgent attack. \n Figure 2 ROUND HERE \n \nThe  new \u2017Close-in, terrestrial means\u2016 of surveillance, intelligence and targeting centre \non the \u2017data mining\u2018 and tracking techniques familiar from the commercial aspirations. To \nachieve this, biometric sensors will need to verify and code people\u2018s identities, as they \nflow through national or other borders, through finger\/palm prints; iris scans; DNA; face-\nrecognition; voice recognition; even odour and gait recognition (Figure 3). (The DSB \nreport favours combinations of iris and fingerprint scans, combined with face recognition, \nas \u2015offering a reasonably effective compromise among speed, accuracy, ease of \nimplementation and cost\u2016 (DSB, 2004,159). A  wide range of technologies deploying \nalgorithmic calculation, tracking  and data mining are being deployed to reconfigure \npassport systems, borders, even public transport transactions, based on the biometric \ntracking of identities. All of these centre on combinations of data mining, risk-profiling, \nattempts at pre-empting risk, and identifying purported \u2017targets of interest\u2018 through what \nLouse Amoore has called \u2015war-like architectures of self\/other\u2016 (Amoore, 2007, 1). They \nwill also connect objects and itineraries, in to blogjects, storing data of who comes into \ncontact with what and when. On the ground, biometric means of bordering, population \ncontrol and incarceration have been widely employed in Iraq, notably in the city of \nFallujah (where all remaining residents have been given ID cards embedding both finger \nprints and retina scans which must be used to pass through fences and checkpoints \nencircling the town). Meanwhile, new projects titled \u2017Transparent Urban Structures\u2018 and \nthe \u2017Visibuilding\u2018 program have been funded which seek to build sensors which \nautomatically penetrate the built fabric of cities.  \n \nFIGURE 3 ROUND HERE \n \n\u2017Combat Zones That See\u2018 \n \nA particularly interesting project embracing the ideas of the DSB report is the tellingly \ntitle \u2017Combat Zones That See\u2018 project set up by the  US Defense Advanced Research \nProjects Agency (DARPA).  Launched at the start of the Iraq insurgency in 2003, CTS \n\u2015explores concepts, develops algorithms, and delivers systems for utilising large \nnumbers (1000s) of algorithmic video cameras to provide the close-in sensing \ndemanded for military operations in urban terrain\u2016 (DARPA, 2003, 4). Through installing \ncomputerised CCTV across whole occupied cities, the project organisers envisage that, \nwhen deployed, CTS will sustain  \u2015motion-pattern analysis across whole city scales\u2016, \nlinked to the tracking of massive populations of individualised cars and people through \nintelligent computer algorithms linked to the recognition of number plates and scanned in \nhuman facial photos to provide close-in, continuous, always-on support for military \noperations in urban terrain\u2016 (DARPA, 2003, 6).  \n \nThe Politics of Anticipatory Seeing \n \nThe work of the Defence Science Board is just one small example of a vast complex of \nresearch and development driven by the apparent inability of western militaries, police \nsecurity agencies to actually identify, track and locate their \u2017targets\u2018 within a globalizing \nand urbanising \u2017battlespace\u2018 where any simple separation of the home city from the \nhostile one breaks down.  Absolutely crucial in these emerging surveillance systems is a \nradically new politics of anticipatory seeing. For the overarching feature of the new, \nmilitarised, surveillance push, whether its \u2017targets\u2018 are located in Manhattan and \nBaghdad, London and Fallujah, is an attempt to build systems of technological vision in \nwhich computer code itself is, along with databases of real or imaged \u2017targets\u2018,  \ndelegated with the agency of  tracking and identifying \u2017abnormal\u2018 \u2017targets\u2018 from the \nbackground \u2017normality\u2018 of a homeland or war-zone city. (After all, no system directly \nsupervised by humans ca n ever hope to cope with the amount of data generated by \nsurveillance system which, in effect, attempt to capture all of life itself).  \n \nCrucial here is the adaptation of the commercial practices of \u2017data mining\u2018 or \u2017predictive \nanalytics\u2018 where algorithms are developed to look for patterns in the swathes of captured \ndate, identify or profile behaviours or characteristics deemed to be \u2017unusual\u2018 or \n\u2017abnormal\u2018, and  search for \u2017target\u2018 people, transactions or flows deemed to have such \ncharacteristics (see McCue, 2005 and Pruett, 2005)). \n \nJordan Crandall, an influential media theorist, has gone furthest in analysing the shift \ntowards ubiquitous high-tech tracking, anticipatory profiling, and colonial, military power. \nTo Crandall, \u2015tracking is integral\u2016 to the emerging  modes of governance and sovereign \nand military power based on anticipatory seeing. \u2016  (Crandall, 1999) The key question \nnow, he suggests, is \u2015how  targets are identified and distinguished from non-targets\u2016 \nwithin \u2015decision making  and killing.\u2016  (Crandall 1999) Identifying such targets becomes \nthe role of statistical algorithms which sift the mass and flux of registered and sensed \ndata searching for [what Mark Seltzer  has teemed] \u2017statistical persons\u2018\u2016. Most important \nhere is that all potential \u2017targets\u2018 must be incorporated into databases in the first place.  \nIndeed, the existence of a signature in a database increasingly defines citizenship in this \nnew age: \u2015frequently [...] there is no person who exists outside of the database\u2016 \n(Crandall 1999).   \n \nTo Crandall, this widespread integration of computerised tracking with databases of \n\u2017targets\u2018 represents little but  of  \u2015a gradual colonization of the now, a now always slightly \nahead of itself\u2016  (Crandall 1999). This shift represents a process of profound \nmilitarization because the social identification  of people within civilian law enforcement \nis complemented or even replaced by the  machinic seeing of \u2017targets\u2018. \u2015While civilian \nimages are embedded in processes of identification based on reflection,\u2016 writes \nCrandall, \u2015militarised perspectives collapse identification processes into \u2015Id-ing\u2016 - one-\nway channel of identification in which a conduit, a database, and  a body are aligned and \ncalibrated\u2016 (Crandall 1999). Again, this is central to the relationship between the \napplication of identical surveillance systems in  both homeland and war zone \nsecuritisation. Crandall suggest that the new capacity of anticipatory seeing involves a \nkind of  \u2016armed vision where the capabilities of vision are \u2015upgraded and made safe \nagainst an unprocessed exteriority, a dangerous and unreliable outside\u2016  (Crandall \n1999). \n \nTechnophiliac Imaginings: Perfect Power \n \nAs is common in the development of new US military capabilities, technophiliac fantasy \nplays a major role in discourses surrounding new ambient technology projects. \nInvariably, these portray perfect technological omniscience against the new challenges \nof assymetric warfare as ushering in a new world of \u2017clean\u2018 war where the  Clauswitzian \nfog and friction war is overcome for ever. Crucially, after the horrors of the streets of \nIraq, US personnel are, once again, removed from the increasingly automated and \ncyborgian projection of perfect power into the metropolitan spaces which hide America\u2018s \nnew enemies.  \n In 2004 Defense Watch magazine, for example,  developed one scenario in response to \nthe news about the \u2017Combat Zones `That See\u2018 programme discussed above. \u2015Several \nlarge fans are stationed outside the city limits of an urban target that our [sic] guys need \nto take\u2016, they begin: \n\u2015Upon appropriate signal, what appears like a dust cloud emanates from \neach fan. The cloud is blown into town where it quickly dissipates. After a \nfew minutes of processing by laptop-size processors, a squadron of small, \ndisposable aircraft ascends over the city. The little drones dive into \nselected areas determined by the initial analysis of data transmitted by the \nfan-propelled swarm. Where they disperse their nano-payloads.\u2016 \n \n \u2015After this, the processors get even more busy\u2016, continues the scenario: \n\u2016Within minutes the mobile tactical center have a detailed visual and audio \npicture of every street and building in the entire city. Every hostile [person] \nhas been identified and located. From this point on, nobody in the city \nmoves without the full and complete knowledge of the mobile tactical \ncenter. As blind spots are discovered, they can quickly be covered by \nadditional dispersal of more nano-devices. Unmanned air and ground \nvehicles can now be vectored directly to selected targets to take them out, \none by one. Those enemy combatants clever enough to evade actually \nbeing taken out by the unmanned units can then be captured of killed by \nhuman elements who are guided directly to their locations, with full and \ncomplete knowledge of their individual fortifications and defenses  [\u2026]. \nWhen the dust settles on competitive bidding for BAA 03-15 [the code \nnumber for the \u2017Combat Zones That See\u2018 programme], and after the first \nprototypes are delivered several years from now, our guys are in for a \nmind-boggling treat at the expense of the bad guys\u2016 (2004, sic.) \n \nArt and Activism: Reenchanting and Reanimating the City? \n \nAmid these commercial and military dreams there are incraesingly widespread calls \u2013 \nand this is our third area -- to try  to realise and reclaim the potentials of augmented \nspaces through art and acticism. Explicit calls have been  made to both open up the \nspaces and simultaneously to reveal these developing trends.  \u2017The new hybrid space \nalso calls for new forms of public action. These can only be created and facilitated if the \nusers of hybrid space learn to see the influence of relatively invisible digital structures \nand appropriate their technology where possible for alternative use.\u2018 (Kraan 2006: 39). In \nthis section, then, we want outline some critical praxis and interventions that have aimed \nin various ways to challenge or subvert (some aspects of) the dominant commercial and \nmilitary visions.  \n \nArt and Augmented Environments \n \nSome artistic endeavours simply render noticeable the augmented environment as in the \nIntelligent Street that monitored predestrian activity levels and used these to produce a \nresponding ambient sound reflecting the bustle of the street. Others employ the \nembedded technology of bio-surveillance. Christian Nold, for instance, sees Bio Mapping \n(http:\/\/www.biomapping.net\/) as about enabling individuals to make use of gathered \ninformation about their own bodies. Instead of security technologies that are designed to \ncontrol and surveille our behavior, his work envisages new tools that allow people to \nselectively share and interpret their own bio data. By sharing this data we can construct \nmaps that visualize where we as a community feel stressed and excited.  Thus in both \nGreenwich Emotion Map (October 2005 - April 2006 http:\/\/www.emotionmap.net\/) and \nSan Francisco Emotion Map (March 2007 - April 2007, SoEx gallery) projects, local \nresidents borrow a \u2017bio mapping\u2018 device, that records galvanic skin responses, to go for \na walk and the data is used to produce an interactive Google Mush to provide a different \nencoding of urban space. There are also deliberate attempts to counter some \nhegemonic practices we have laid out in the preceding sections. Thus the New York \nbased Preemptive media project aimed to challenge the tracking of products with its \nintervention \u2017Zapped!\u2018. This entailed fitting hissing cockcroahes with RFID tags and then \nreleasing them in Walmart. The effect was to pollute and corrupt databases as the \ncreatures broadcast digital \u2017noise\u2018 as they moved though the store (Kluitenbrouwer 2006: \n54). The associations of dirt and pollution carried over to digital pollution are a direct \nchallenge to the visions of sanitised and transparent corporate spaces. However, our \ninterest is less with direct challenges than the many interventions that together form an \nalternate animation of the environment. \n \nIn this we want to point to the attempts to both foster social contact but also to focus \nupon the sorts of spaces created and envisioned. We want to highlight that the places \ncreated involve less of the \u2017anticipation\u2018 of action than the inscription of memory. This is \nconnected to enabling specific new social performances. We want to take these through \nthree overlapping registers. The first take the data coding of the environment and seek \nto make it transparent and\/or aesthetically problematic. The second are those that seek \nto re-enchant the environment through multi-authored overcodings. That is they take \naugmented space but seek to pluralise the authorship. The third are those that seek to \nfoster new engagements with the environment by promoting new practices of direct \ncontact and association. In this sense both the last two draw upon the notions of social \nnetworking and collaboration through dispersed and networked devices, taking virtual \ncommunity out of the wires and onto the streets. \n \nIn part these artistic experiments with locative media can be characterised as \nresponding to a depiction or criticism of the built environment as disenchanted and \nalienating. The locative media aim to offer a re-enchantment and reworking of the \nspaces through refashioning the overlaying of informational environments onto the \nlandscape. In one sense this is not a unique task or ambition for locative media and yet \nthe tailoring of response may be: \n\u2017the overlaying of different spaces is a conceptual problem that is not \nconnected to any particular technology, we may start to think about which \narchitects and artists have already been working on this problem. To put it \nanother way, the layering of dynamic and contextual data over physical \nspace is a particular case of a general aesthetic paradigm: how to combine \ndifferent spaces together. Of course, electronically augmented space is \nunique \u2013 since the information is personalized for every user, it can change \ndynamically over time, and it is delivered through an interactive multimedia \ninterface, etc. Yet it is crucial to see this as a conceptual rather than just a \ntechnological issue\u2018 (Manovich 2006: 225-6).  \n \nManovich  thus gives the guided audio walks of Janet Cardiff as an example that \nattempts to overcode the present city with memories of the past, to produce a space that \nis not quite of the now but is rather haunted by ghostly, technologically preserved or \nrecalled presences (Pinder 2001).  \n Collaborative Authoring and Locative Media Projects \n \nCollaborative authoring and locative media have greatly expanded the possibilities for \nthese attempts to re-enchant the world. Some projects such as \u2017Pedestrian: A Walking \nTour for Multiple Voices and Portable Phones- New York City\u2018 \n(http:\/\/www.pedestrianproject.com\/id1.html) stages the aural publicity of new media that \nhas turned us all into audiences of one half of so many conversations. Three guides set \nout to take a walking tour around the East Village in New York pointing out lost elements \nof landscape (such as gay bathouses replaced by petrol stations), with audiences \nchoosing  to follow one of the guides but being able to overcode this by listening to two \nothers taking different routes. Here we have a double play of presence, haunting and \ntopography. Other projects push the collaborative sense of new media allowing them to \nrecord the multiple memories and histories of places. They thus attempt to record and \ngive a voice to the myriad of invisible histories and myths of places. Where once there \nwere official and dominant memories inscribed on the city now these stories from below \ncan be added.\u2013 In Michel de Certeau\u2018s terms, the dispersed knowledges of practices \nreplace the homogeneity of single rationales (de Certeau 1997: 116) and open space to \ndifference, since stories about places are makeshift things, composed of the world\u2018s \ndebris (de Certeau 1984: 107). His suggested mode of knowledge through travel where \npractices have no place of their own but move in the territory of the other (de Certeau \n1986: 202) would speak to the unstable multiply coded and fleeting geographies of these \ntours.  \n \nDe Certeau was ontologically sceptical of attempts to stabilise such knowledge, \nsuggesting it ossified and drained the very life he celebrated, cautioning us that science \ncould never make princesses of all these Cinderellas (1984:67) for that would \nnecessarily reduce them to representations rather than practices. However, with multiple \nauthored web sites the technological optimists would say we can do just that. Thus, \nprojects such as Murmure (http:\/\/murmure.ca\/) first launched in Toronto\u2018s Kensington \nMarket in summer 2003, then Vancouver\u2018s Chinatown and then Montreal allows people \nto take a web based map and tag sites with stories and memories of what the places \nmean to them in a form of \u2017intimate commemoration\u2018. Many other projects have \ndeveloped this theme especially the possibility of collaborative authoring connected to \nlocative media. Perhaps we might see this as evidence that if \u2017as is so often claimed, \ncontent is king, then surely the most valuable and relevant content about local places for \nlocal people is not going to come from media companies, but directly from their peers \nand neighbours?\u2018 (Lane 2004: 4). The German based Yellow Arrow project \n(http:\/\/yellowarrow.net\/index2.php) describes itself as a Massively Authored Artistic \nProject (in a parody of Massively Authored Online Games) which sets out to add depth \nto our world. It seeks explicitly \u2017alternative\u2018 accounts to be attached to places, as in its \nGuerrilla Innsbruck Map project, with Yellow Arrow stickers pointing to sites. These \nstickers are registered with your specific code and your thoughts on the place to which \nthey point \u2013 that could be in prose, video or audio format. Anyone dialling in the code via \nphone or web can call up this material. \n \nThe Social Tapestries and Urban Tapestries projects (http:\/\/urbantapestries.net\/), \nmeanwhile, attempt to document the world as we experience it at street level an thus \nalso adds a sense of bodily motion moving through and between sites. Explicitly drawing \nupon de Certeau\u2018s formulation of evasive memories and urban myths Through pervasive \nlocation based authoring. Here with tools such as the Feral Robot (automatically sensing \nand posting pollution data) alongside people posting stories, thoughts and experiences \nthe aim is to build up an experiential spatial database which can be tapped into on the \nmove via mobile phones. As you walk through the city then a range of additional \nsupporting information of both interest and use is available and passed to you on a hand \nheld screen. The aim is to show how pervasive technologies do not have to pacify us as \nconsumers but can allow us to claim and mark our territory. But the aim is allow a \ncommunity to share knowledge in as the title suggest interwoven layers of discourse \nover the topography of the city (Jungnickel 2004: 3). In this it takes inspiration from work \non \u2017Songlines\u2018 both in Aboriginal contexts and other multimedia projects (such as that by \nNaureckas, Jim. Nd. New York Songlines. URL: http:\/\/www.nysonglines.com\/) that \nattempt to disrupt \u2017flat\u2018 visions of space and community (Silverstone and Sujon 2005).  It \nis perhaps significant to note that despite claims and accounts of ubiquity, processing \npower and control issues meant this was an experiment restricted to a small number of \nregistered users. Indeed studies of users found many struggled to find a \u2017point\u2018 to the \nsystem, but often were enthusiastic about its ability to allow them to share experiences \nwith meaningful others (Silverstone and Sujon 2005: 46). \n \nCrucially, these initiatives do not aim to provide though merely a linguistic supplement or \nrecord of our daily engagement with the world. Rather, in de Certeau\u2018s terms, they show \nthe little narratives that organise, frame and enable our engagement:  \n\u2017These narrated adventures, simultaneously producing geographies of \nactions and drifting into the commonplaces of an order, do not merely \nconstitute a \u2017supplement\u2018 to pedestrian enunciations and rhetorics. They \nare not satisfied with displacing the latter and transposing them into the \nfield of language. In reality, they organize walks. They make the journey, \nbefore or during the time the feet perform it\u2018 (de Certeau 1984: 115-6). \n \nThe above projects thus take these to be spatial stories and work on how they act in the \nworld. The system builds connective tissues of threads linking places following people\u2018s \nmovements \u2013 both mental and physical.  \n \nAs these spatial annotation projects move out into the world of motion perhaps brings us \ninto the third kind of intervention with a stronger sense of fostering new engagements \nwith the environment. Here the media is not just location based but mobile to foster what \nde Souza e Silva calls \u2017hybrid-reality\u2018 where networked communities move into hybrid \nspaces. Perhaps the best examples are hybrid-reality games. These are multiuser \ngames played with cell phones equipped with location awareness and Internet \nconnections that allow players to use city space as the game board. The most \ncelebrated, and first commercially released, is perhaps Botfighters, produced in Sweden \nin 2001 by It\u2018s Alive   though Mogi in Japan, released in 2004, is a similarly hybrid reality \ngame. In Botfighter, a first person shoot\u2018em game moves into the city as people tag each \nother in real space with mobile phone texts. Opponents track each other down in urban \nneighborhoods and streetsas their mobile phones provide them with information on \nwhere other opponents are (Shirvanee 2006). In Mogi, the main goal is to look for virtual \ncreatures and objects spread around the city of Tokyo,  which can be caught and \nuploaded into their cell phones. However, some creatures go out only at night, so \nplayers must go to specific places at specific times to capture particular creatures (de \nSouza e Silva 2006: 266-70).  \n \nEffects of Animating Spaces \n \nIn terms of animating spaces, then, we can see two key effects. First, both these games \ntransform the city space into the game board so that the familiar space of the city is \ntransformed into a new and unexpected environment. So it is \u2017as if the game creates an \nimaginary playful layer that merges with the city space, connecting people who \npreviously did not know one another via mobile technologies according to their \nmovement in physical spaces\u2018 (de Souza e Silva 2006: 272). Second, they work to \ncreate and foster new social communities, or socio-technical communities through \nlocative performances. They bring people together into new formations \u2013 in the case of \nUrban Tapestries for using and understanding the neighbourhood, or for new socialities \naround games for Mogi or Botfighters. Thus as Shirvanee comments on Botfighters \nmight say that as \u2017paths of social activity are made possible by the augmentation of \ngeographic space with locative information, an invisible layer of association emerges. \nOne prevalent activity of the mobile street culture is to engage in locative games\u2018 \n(Shirvanee 2006). There are many more such games that range from impromptu art or \ndance to developing shared knowledge on the haptic qualities of skateboard routes (a \ngood starter list is provided by Galloway 2004). \n \nWe might then try and think this through with a sense of what this does to movement in \nspace. Shirvanee (2006) picks on the metaphor of viscosity to try and describe the \ntechnoscial world of pervasive computing. By viscosity she is pointing to speed of events \nand resistance \u2013 where the denser the fluid the greater the resistance to velocity. These \nartistic media are trying to densify the liquid \u2013 not solidify places. Thus: \n\u2017When information can actively find you on the street, there is a viscosity of \nspace that forms between strangers with locative media, creating \nlandscapes charged with traces of others that have inhabited the same \nspace. In this early stage of location-based media, a greater connectivity \nand interaction between people who share a common interest, is thought to \nhold the promise of invigorating the public sphere to create an awareness \nand, therefore, a vitality of activity and public dialogue in spaces that might \notherwise remain stagnant. This density and cohesion is more or less \nexplicitly opposed to notions of disorientation and distractedness in \ncontemporary urbanity\u2016 (Shirvanee 2006). \n \nConclusions \n \nOne of our aims in this unusually wide-ranging paper has been to simply outline that \nthere is a great deal of work going on developing and exploring pervasive computing \nfrom commercial, military and artistic angles. We have also wanted to show that all of \nthese offer significant contributions to thinking about both what the urban environment \nmight become but also into how we think about it. \n \nThe developments addressed in this paper suggest that -- in a world of augmented, \nenacted, transduced or \u2017blogjected\u2018 space -- we will no longer, even if we ever could, be \nable  to see the environment as a mere passive backcloth for social action. At the very \nleast the environment has always recursively influenced and been influenced by action. \nWhat these technologies do is to change the temporality of that action. Much writing has \nfocused on the real-time nature of links - such as drawing down locationally sensitive \ndata for transactions. But in this paper we have, rather, tried to add a sense that \nenvironments are now being saturated with anticipatory technologies. These profile \nusers in more sophisticated ways that in the end possibly pacify that user by creating a \ndelegated agency.  \n \nThis, of course, risks delegating whole sets of decisions and, along with that, the ethics \nand politics of those decisions, to invisible and sentient systems which both blur \nseamlessly into local, urban environments, and enact and organise global and \ntransational flows (Graham, 2005). Increasingly, then, the key technologies may not be \nabout bandwidth or access but sensors \u2013 cheap, ubiquitous and of extremely high \nperformance (McCullough 2004: 74). Instead of being intensively planned and rigged, \nthey will use more and more local hop or unplanned communications where increasingly \ndevices can \u2017poll\u2018 their locality.  \n \nThese sensors, tags and processors will increasingly function passively, that is via \ndelegation. Partly this is due to the sheer complexity of multiple interfaces is partly due \nto interfaces and technology too often being too varied for anyone to learn. The lesson \nwe draw from the artistic endeavours is, first, that these technologies need to be made \nvisible. If they simply become buried infrastructure without ever being visible to most \nusers we shall surely miss the chance for many people to influence their development. \nSecond, they may contain memory and link to the past just as much as anticipation. \nThey may offer the possibility of enriched community formation. Not indeed the \nembedded and static version of community but community as assemblage in flux, as \nturbulence and eddies in the data stream. Third, these approaches animate space but \nperhaps augment is the wrong word. The connotations are too solid. Better, perhaps, is \na sense of destabilising spaces or haunting them with absent others \u2013 those rendered \ntelepresent from different times and\/or spaces. In this sense they serve to suggest, \ndespite all the emphasis on locative technologies, that the \u2017warranting\u2018 of agents in \nspecific spaces and times, is becoming more problematic \u2013 if not in fact down right \nvague. The double, indeed triple and quadruple, coding of spaces and people through \nnarratives and information carried in digital networks may actually serve to disperse our \nnotion of both person and place. This also demands a new conceptual imagination of \nspace and time. Presence is no longer mere physical proximity. Instead it is a notion of \nattention or perhaps of temporal continuity \u2013 remaining with memories (Lane 2004) and \nhaving actions projected into the future  \n \nThi, then, may offer the start of a more hopeful discourse regarding the disturbing trends \ncurrently towards the militarisation and surveillance of spaces through ubiquitous \ncomputing. We need to recall that these dreams of transparency and omniscience are \nlong-standing. However, experience should tell us that \u2017omniscience is elusive. As \nanyone who has ever tried to resolve a simple billing dispute will know, even the \ntelephone company lacks enough internal coordination to make sense of its data to you. \nAnd anyone who has ever dealt with a state-level bureaucracy knows, the odds of omni-\ncompetance remain low. Generally,\u2018 as information becomes more and more abundant, \nclear views trough it becomes less and less possible\u2018 (McCullough 2004: 15). The \nstandards of pervasive computing are indeed allowing local polling and linked devices \nbut this is not the seamless and unbiquitous process that many accounts suggest. The \nlinking technology is generally a \u2017kludge\u2018, as software designers call it. That is a \nbricolage of component middleware, none of it really designed for the task to which it is \nput, nor perfectly configured to work with other middleware or devices it encounters and \nthus running \u2017sub-optimally\u2018 but functioning nonetheless (Mackenzie 2005). Indeed Matt \nLocke eloquently describes the granularity of this new digital terrain: \n\u2017Mobile networks have to negotiate the architecture of spaces that they \nattempt to inhabit. Although the interfaces have removed themselves from \nphysical architectures, the radio waves that connect cell spaces are \nrefracted and reflected by the same obstacles, creating not a seamless \nnetwork but a series of ebbs and flows. The supposedly flat space of the \nnetwork is in fact not flat, pulled into troughs and peaks by the gravity of \narchitecture and the users themselves.\u2018(Manovich 2006: 228-9) \n \nQuite the opposite of a \u2017global brain\u2018 or total vision then, we may find that temporary and \n\u2017good-enough\u2018 may lead to \u2017local aggregations of self-connecting systems can become \nislands of coherence in the chaos raised by pervasive computing\u2018 (McCullough 2004: \n71). Far from the pure vision of what de Certeau calls the \u2017concept city\u2018, we may find the \nproduction of myriads and little stories. Some commercial, some personal, maybe some \nmilitarised. There is a real issue about proliferating knowledges circulating routinely and \nmore or less autonomously of people. But amidst all this is the potential to create new \nformations and momentary stabilities. What remains less clear whether this is merely \nmaking what was formerly protected by its opacity and transitoriness, visible and \nrecordable. As such there may well be an issue where rendering our tacit socio-spatial \npractices visible is an uncomfortably close echo of commodified and surveillant systems.  \n \n \nArts media Web Sites \n \nGrafedia (http:\/\/www.grafedia.net\/) accessed March 2007 \nMurmure (http:\/\/murmure.ca\/) accessed March 2007  \nNaureckas, Jim.
