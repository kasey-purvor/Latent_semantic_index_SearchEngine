We find no such linear relation-\nship and, while agreeing that there is considerable uncertainty in\nthe prediction of future sea level rise, consider that this approach\ndoes not meaningfully contribute to quantifying this uncertainty.\nRahmstorf (1) proposed a relationship between global mean surface temperatures (2,3)\nand the rate of global mean sea level change (4). The approach assumes that \u201cthe rate\nof sea level rise is approximately proportional to the magnitude of warming above the\npre-industrial temperature\u201d. On this basis sea level is predicted to rise 0.5-1.4 m above\nthe 1990 level by 2100. These estimates are considerably higher than those published in\nthe IPCC Third Assessment Report (5) and therefore require closer inspection.\n1\nThe calculation of the linear relationship between temperature and the rate of sea level\nchange did not explore whether the calculated proportionality constant of 3.4 mm\/yr\/\u25e6C\napplies to the timescales of most relevance (i.e. decades to centuries). Fig. 1(a) below\nreproduces Fig. 2 in (1). As in (1), both the temperature and sea level timeseries are\nsmoothed with the Monte Carlo Singular Spectrum Analysis method (MC-SSA) (6) to\nremove energy with periods of less than 15 years. However we have split the data into\nfour epochs which approximately relate to the four dominant periods of the temperature\nrecord (Fig. 1(b)) and we have avoided adding the 5 year binning applied in (1) to the\n15 year smoothed timeseries as this would further reduce the degrees of freedom. Figure\n1(a) clearly demonstrates that no linear relationship exists on a 50 year timescale, that is\n50% of the 100 year period for which predictions are made in (1).\nWe note that using the model employed\ndH\/dt = a(T \u2212 T0) (1)\n(where a is the proportionality constant, T is the global mean temperature and T0 is the\nprevious equilibrium temperature value) with the quoted values of a = 3.4 mm\/yr\/\u25e6C and\nT0 = \u22120.5\n\u25e6C (1) gives dH\/dt = 1.7 mm\/yr with zero (average) change in temperature\n(i.e. with T = 0). This shows that the mean rate obtained from this model over the\npast century agrees well with other estimates of sea level rise over the past 100 years\n(e.g. (4, 7)). The issue though is whether this model can provide information at shorter\nperiods than the century scale in order that it can be used to predict global sea levels\nsome decades into the future.\nA reasonable test of the strength of a model is to be able to predict observations\nwhich are not already included in its formulation. To illustrate the non-linearity of the\ntemperature\/sea level change relationship we calculate linear coefficients for the first half\n2\nof the observational record and then proceed to predict the remaining observations. We\nalso use the second half of the data set to hindcast sea levels during the earlier part of\nthe record.\nTo make this testing sensitive to changes on timescales of decades, which are of most\ninterest for prediction, we detrended both the smoothed surface temperatures and the\nsmoothed sea levels for the first and second halves of the data before calculating the\nannual rates of sea level change (detrending improves the results but does not change\ntheir character). We then calculated the linear regression coefficients for the two halves\nof the data (a1, a2) along with the equivalent values of T0 (i.e. T01 , T02). Finally, to obtain\nthe full dH\/dt, we added back the linear trend which had been subtracted from the sea\nlevels.\nFrom the above regression we obtain a1 = 8.26 mm\/yr\/\n\u25e6C and T01 = \u22120.12\n\u25e6C, for\nthe first half of the data and a2 = 6.60 mm\/yr\/\n\u25e6C and T02 = \u22120.32\n\u25e6C for the second\nhalf, compared with a = 3.4 mm\/yr\/\u25e6C and T0 = \u22120.5\n\u25e6C from fitting the whole data\nset. The RMS error over the first half of the record that the data is fitted to is 0.21 mm\nand 0.35 mm over the second half of the record when the data is fitted to that. This is\nin comparison with 0.62 mm for the model when fitted to all the data, illustrating that\nwe do indeed obtain a better fit to the data included in the model over the shorter time\nperiods.\nThe results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 2 which shows that at the 50-100 year\ntimescale the linear relationship has little skill in predicting the observations not included\nin the original model formulation. Using the coefficients obtained from the first half of\nthe data a trend in sea level of 0.86 mm\/yr is predicted for the entire 122 year period,\nwhereas using the second half of the data a trend of 1.98 mm\/yr is calculated. These\ncompare with a trend of 1.49 mm\/yr for the sea level reconstruction (4) over the period\n3\n1880-2001, implying that the semi-empirical approach is very sensitive to the time period\nover which the model is formulated.\nIn conclusion, whilst we agree that there is considerable uncertainty in future projec-\ntions of sea level change and that model predictions currently appear to under-estimate\nobservations, we do not agree that simplistic projections of the nature presented (1)\ncontribute any understanding of the uncertainties in the non-linear relationships of the\nclimate system.\nReferences and Notes\n1.
