Introduction\n[2] Although the generation of propagating internal tides,\ntheir nonlinear interaction, and the associated short waves,\nin shelf edge regions [e.g., Holt and Thorpe, 1997] and the\nresulting mixing due to internal waves [Van Haren et al.,\n2002; Van Haren, 2004] has been a research topic for\nmany years [see, e.g., Pingree and New, 1989, 1991; Lamb,\n1994; Vlasenko et al., 2005], little work has been done to\nexamine how internal tides generated at two topographic\nfeatures interact with one another and the associated mixing.\nThe recent notable exception here is the work of Chao et al.\n[2007], who examined internal tide generation over two\nridges in the Luzon Strait. The classic picture of internal\ntide generation at the shelf edge (or any steep isolated\ntopographic feature, e.g., seamount, ridge, or sill) is that of\nan on\u2010shelf\/off\u2010shelf barotropic tide giving rise to a vertical\ndisplacement of the pycnocline, which, as it moves over the\nshelf slope, gives rise to a progressive internal wave (internal\ntide) (see, e.g., Baines [1995], Legg [2004a, 2004b], Legg\nand Klymak [2008], and classic sill observations of Farmer\nand Armi [1999a, 1999b] and Farmer and Dugan [1980]).\nDepending upon the ratio of the local topographic slope\ns = dh\/dx (with h water depth and x across\u2010shelf coordinate)\nto the internal wave slope given bya = ((w2 \u2212 f 2)\/(N2 \u2212 w2))1\/2,\nwhere w is tidal frequency, f is Coriolis frequency, and N\nis local buoyancy frequency, the tide is classed as subcritical\n(s\/a < 1), critical (s\/a = 1), or supercritical (s\/a > 1). Max-\nimum internal tide generation occurs at the critical slope, and\ndepending upon shelf slope topography, internal wave prop-\nagation onto the shelf or back into the ocean along raypaths\ncan occur. In the case of an oceanic propagating internal\ntide, it can be reflected by off\u2010shelf topography such as a\nseamount, thereby changing the spatial distribution in the\nshelf edge region [Xing and Davies, 1998] compared to that at\nother locations where there is no seamount. Associated with\nthe reflection and interaction of internal tidal beams are\nregions of enhanced mixing [e.g., Eriksen, 1985]. This prob-\nlem has been examined in the context of interaction of internal\ntides in an off\u2010shelf region, namely, the Anton Dohrn sea-\nmount and the shelf edge off the west coast of Scotland\nby Xing and Davies [1998]. In addition, the importance\nof small\u2010scale topography on the shelf slope upon internal\ntide generation was examined by Legg [2004a, 2004b] and\nThorpe [2001].\n[3] Besides understanding the influence of small\u2010scale\ntopography in shelf edge regions upon local mixing being an\nimportant topic in its own right, recent research [Samelson,\n1998; Spall, 2001; Saenko, 2006] has shown that it has\nmajor implications in climate models. However, a major\ndifficulty with examining how internal tidal waves from two\ntopographic features interact in a shelf edge environment is\nthe three\u2010dimensional nature of the problem [Cummins and\nOey, 1997] and the complexity of making detailed mea-\nsurements of tidal energy flux and mixing in such a complex\nopen\u2010ocean environment (e.g., the Hawaiian Islands [Carter\net al., 2008]).\n[4] In the case of internal tide generation in tidally forced\nfjords or lochs [e.g., Vlasenko et al., 2002; Inall et al., 2004,\n2005], the problem is essentially two\u2010dimensional in the\nx\u2010z plane, with x the along\u2010fjord axis and z the vertical\ncoordinate. As such, more detailed measurements can be\n1National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool, UK.\nCopyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/11\/2010JC006333\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 116, C04022, doi:10.1029\/2010JC006333, 2011\nC04022 1 of 21\nmade, and also idealized process type models can be used\nto understand the mechanisms leading to internal tide gen-\neration, reflection, interaction, and the associated change in\nthe Richardson number distribution, which has implications\nfor mixing.\n[5] Although internal tide generation, propagation, and\ninteraction has been studied in shelf edge and oceanic\nsituations, to the authors\u2019 knowledge no modeling work of\nthis type has been performed in fjord and loch regions con-\ntaining two sills. As will be shown here, the presence of two\nsills can give rise to internal wave reflection, leading to a\nstanding internal tide between the two sills, which is analo-\ngous to the standing internal wave (seiche motion) induced\nin a stratified lake by wind forcing [Hall and Davies, 2005].\nAlthough standing internal tides have been observed in\nlochs, between the sill at the entrance to the loch and its\nhead [e.g., Allen and Simpson, 1998], and within a canyon\n[Petruncio et al., 1998], to the authors\u2019 knowledge no study,\nother than a preliminary calculation of Xing and Davies\n[2009] for a single sill separation, has been made of how\nmultiple sills within fjords and lochs can produce standing\ninternal tides. In addition, how sill separation influences\nthis interaction, the role of higher harmonic resonance, the\nassociated Richardson number distribution, mixing, and inter-\nnal wave energy flux have not been considered.\n[6] In this paper the mechanisms giving rise to internal\ntide generation, interaction, energy flux, and Richardson\nnumber distribution in a tidal fjord with two symmetric\nshallow sills are examined. Initially, the influence of sill\ndepth and tidal forcing for a single shallow sill are briefly\nconsidered and related to recent work of Legg and Klymak\n[2008, hereinafter LK08] and Klymak et al. [2010, herein-\nafter K10], who considered a large parameter space for a\nsingle obstacle in deep water. The difference in response,\ncompared to a deep\u2010water obstacle, in the shallow single\u2010sill\ncase, namely, the change between wave and jet response,\nis highlighted, as this is a distinct difference between sill\n(in shallow water) and ridge (in deep water). Subsequently,\nthe two\u2010sill case (the main focus of the paper) is considered.\nIn this case, again the influence of sill depth and tidal\nforcing are briefly examined, but the role of sill separation\nupon the internal tide and associated mixing are examined in\nmore detail. These calculations are performed in the context\nof a typical two\u2010sill tidal fjord, such as the Ringdals Fjord\u2013\nIdefjord at the Swedish\u2010Norwegian border, where detailed\nmeasurements were recently made showing enhanced mix-\ning and dissipation between the sills [Johnsson et al., 2007].\nThis enhanced level of mixing was interpreted in terms of\nthat due to a progressive internal tide generated at a single\nsill. Johnsson et al. [2007] attempted to account for both\nsills by considering each sill independently in turn and\nlinearly combining solutions, thereby assuming there was no\ninteraction between the two sills. Here it is shown for short\nsill separation that the presence of a second sill can give rise\nto a standing internal tide between the sills with an associ-\nated increase in mixing due to this process. Hence there can\nbe interaction between internal waves generated at each\nsill. In addition, as the sill separation increases the solution\napproaches that of an isolated sill, and then there is no inter-\naction. However, since higher harmonics of the M2 internal\ntide are generated at each sill, and for some of these harmonics\nthe intersill separation is comparable to their wavelength, then\nfocusing and resonance can lead to increased amplitude and\nhence enhanced interaction at specific intersill separations.\nTherefore the interaction between the sills does not simply\nreduce with their separation but is modified by focusing and\nresonance. For typical intersill separations in fjords, of order\n10 km, and shallow water depths, about 100 m and typical\nvertical density profiles [Johnsson et al., 2007], as will be\nshown, this resonance primarily occurs at the higher harmo-\nnics of the M2 tide, namely, the short waves that are respon-\nsible for mixing. The model used in the calculations together\nwith the domain of interest are presented in section 2. In\nsections 3 and 4 a range of calculations with varying para-\nmeters that control the internal tide and mixing are discussed.\nIn section 5, results of the calculations are summarized.\n2. Model\n[7] Following the successful use of the nonhydrostatic\nMIT\u2010gcm code [Marshall et al., 1997] to model internal\ntides in deep (depths of over 1000 m) ocean regions [e.g.,\nLegg, 2004a, 2004b; Legg and Huijts, 2006] and their\ngeneration over shallow sills [Xing and Davies, 2006, 2007,\nhereinafter XD06 and XD07], the same code is used here.\nAs extensive details are given in the literature, they will not\nbe repeated. The model uses a z coordinate in the vertical\nwith \u201cshaved cells\u201d in the near\u2010bed region to take account of\nvariations in bottom topography. An alternative approach is\nto use a sigma coordinate in the vertical as applied by\nBerntsen and Furnes [2005] and Berntsen et al. [2006] in\ntheir nonhydrostatic model. However, as shown by Berntsen\net al. [2006], both approaches yielded solutions that were\nnot significantly different.\n[8] Resume In the present process\u2010oriented study, two\nsymmetric identical idealized sills are considered, with the\nfirst sill placed at x = 0 and the second a distance L to its\nright. The use of two symmetric sills is consistent with the\ntopography of the region where measurements were made\nby Johnsson et al. [2007]. Calculations are performed ini-\ntially with a single sill at x = 0 (Figure 1a), and subsequently\nwith two sills for a range of intersill separations L extending\nto 10 km (Figure 1b), a typical sill separation in a fjord. The\nsill\u2019s shape is given by\nh0\n\u0001\n1\u00fe x\n\u0001\n\u0003 \u00044\u0005 \u0006\n;\nwith ho sill height and the parameter l = 125 m giving a sill\nhalf width ao of order 500 m. The channel is open at both\nends and extends to x = \u00b1150 km, although only a sub-\ndomain is shown in Figures 1a and 1b. By using this length\nof channel, any small false reflection of the internal wave at\nthe open boundaries (where a sponge condition is applied)\ndoes not propagate back to the region of the sills within\nthe integration period. Previous single sill calculations with\na range of resolutions [Berntsen et al., 2008] showed that\nan accurate solution could be obtained with fine vertical\n(dz = 1 m) and horizontal (dx varied smoothly from 10 m at\nthe sills to 800 m elsewhere) grids. In the series of calcu-\nlations presented later, initially the sill height ho, and hence\naspect ratio ao\/ho, together with sill depth hs, were chosen to\nrepresent those in a typical fjord. In order to examine how\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n2 of 21\nthe presence of a second sill influences the internal tide\ngenerated at a single sill, calculations were performed with\nboth one and two sills for this choice of sill parameters, for a\nfixed intersill separation L. However, as shown by Baines\n[1995] and others [e.g., XD06; XD07; Berntsen et al.,\n2006, 2008], the choice of sill parameters does influence\ninternal tide generation, at a single sill. As the single sill\ncase has been investigated for a large range of parameters,\nhere only a small number of these parameters are considered\nto check that the conclusions concerning the presence of the\nsecond sill are valid in the more general case. In addition for\noceanic depths (of order 2000 m) a detailed parameter study\nhas been performed by LK08 for tidal flow and by KL10 for\nsteady flow. Results from LK08 are used to understand the\nsingle sill calculations and extend their range. In addition,\nthe shallow single sill calculation is used to illustrate the\nformation of a jet on the downstream side of the sill, which\ndoes not occur in the deep oceanic case of LK08. However,\nsince the focus here is how the presence of the second sill\ninfluences the internal tide and mixing in the intersill region,\na more extensive set of calculations are subsequently per-\nformed with fixed sill parameters but varying the distance L.\n[9] Motion in the region was started from a state of rest,\nwith horizontal temperature surfaces and barotropic tidal\nforcing of amplitude Uo applied as a body force. Outside the\nsill regions this gave rise to tidal velocities of corresponding\namplitudes, although in the region of the sill (see section 3)\nthe barotropic current increased as water depth decreased.\nIf the rigid lid approximation was used, then the ratio of\nbarotropic current speed to local water depth would be\nconstant. However, in the present case the model has a free\nsurface, and hence this ratio changes with space and time.\nBy varying Uo, the sensitivity of the solution to changes\nin across\u2010sill velocity Us could be briefly determined, with\nresults from LK08 used to interpret this response and\nextend it to other parameter spaces. In all initial calculations\n(Table 1), forcing was at the M2 tidal period w, with Coriolis\nfrequency f = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124s\u22121 and initial buoyancy frequency\nN = 0.01s\u22121. Although the same initial value of N is used\neverywhere, its distribution changes with time as mixing\noccurs. These parameters have been used previously in single\nsill calculations (XD06; XD07) and are appropriate here.\n[10] As fine numerical grids were used in the calcula-\ntions and a nonhydrostatic model was applied, then small\u2010\nscale mixing could be approximated with minimum values\nof vertical (KV) and horizontal (Kh) diffusivities, i.e., KV =\nKh = 10\n\u22127 m2 s\u22121. Consequently, mixing was controlled by\nsmall\u2010scale processes, namely, shear instabilities and over-\nturning that were generated in the nonhydrostatic model and\ncould be resolved on the fine grid. To maintain numerical\nstability without artificially damping the solution [Berntsen\net al., 2008], background eddy viscosity values, namely,\nAV = 10\n\u22123 m2 s\u22121 and Ah = 10\n\u22121 m2 s\u22121, were used together\nwith a time step of 2 s. Ideally a significantly finer grid than\nthat used here, with smaller values of these parameters, in\nTable 1.

Sill positions are shown by the arrow.\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n3 of 21\nparticular, an AV value comparable to the KV value could be\nused. However, as shown by Berntsen et al. [2008], as AV\nand Ah values are reduced, small\u2010scale eddies that cannot be\nresolved without an extremely fine grid (that is computa-\ntionally prohibitive) are generated, grow, and eventually\ndestabilize the solution. However, without an extremely fine\ngrid, an accurate determination of the mixing is not possible.\nRather, the approach followed here is that adopted by Legg\n[2004a, 2004b] and Legg and Huijts [2006] of examining\nRichardson number distributions and changes in the buoy-\nancy anomaly, namely, to examine how changes in sill\ntopography and intersill separation influence the distribution\nof the Richardson number. In addition, the change in the\ntemperature field due to parameter variations in particular\nintersill separation will be quantified in terms of changes in\nbuoyancy frequency N. Despite the fine grid applied in the\nmodel and low values of sub\u2010grid\u2010scale mixing, there is\nsome artificial damping and diffusion associated with the\nnumerical techniques, in particular, the advection scheme\n(which is second order with the application of flux limiter)\nused in the model. This presents a difficulty in comparing\nmodeled and observed mixing [see Burchard and Rennau,\n2008; Rennau and Burchard, 2009] but is less of a prob-\nlem in examining how intersill separation influences the\nsolution. However, as shown by Vlasenko et al. [2005], it can\nartificially widen and damp tidal beams that will influence\nfocusing and resonance (see section 5). Approaches aimed at\nreducing artificial numerical damping and mixing [Klymak\nand Legg, 2010] will help to reduce this problem.\n[11] In order to quantify the interaction between the two\nsills, it is interesting to see how the presence of the second\nsill influences mixing in the sill region, the energy flux\nmagnitude, and distribution compared to a single sill. Owing\nto dissipation and mixing, which are shown by Johnsson\net al. [2007] to be very large in these fjord systems,\nenergy is removed from the internal tide as it propagates\naway from its generation point. Consequently, as the sepa-\nration distance L increases, then the solution in the intersill\nregion should converge to that of a single sill, as the\ninfluence of the second sill is reduced. However, as will be\nshown, for typical intersill separations in fjords this picture\nis complicated by focusing and resonance at higher har-\nmonic frequencies. As shown by Davies et al. [2009], in the\ncase of a steep sill in shallow water it is essential to retain\nboth the nonlinear and free surface terms in the energy flux\ncalculation. As details of energy flux calculations are given\nby Venayagamoorthy and Fringer [2005] and Moum et al.\n[2007], they will not be presented here.\n3. Single\u2010 and Two\u2010Sill Calculations With L Fixed\n[12] In order to quantify and understand how the presence\nof the second sill influences the solution in the region\nbetween the sills, it is essential to initially briefly examine a\nsingle\u2010sill solution. This is done in the context of the detailed\nstudy of LK08 who examined the response of a tall steep\nridge to tidal flow in oceanic depths. Here difference between\nthe shallow sill and deep oceanic problem are stressed.\n3.1. Single\u2010Sill Calculation (Calc 1), Uo = 0.1 m s\n\u22121,\nhs = 30 m\n[13] In an initial calculation (Table 1), forcing was at the\nM2 frequency and Uo was fixed at 0.1 m s\n\u22121, with sill depth\nhs = 30 m and sill half width as = 500 m. As a detailed study\nof the response of a shallow single sill to a range of Uo, as\nand hs values is given by XD06, and for the deep oceanic\ncase by LK08, only the main features that are relevant to the\ntwo\u2010sill calculations will be presented here. As shown by\nFigure 2. Subdomain of the sill region, i.e., x = \u2212500 m to 2000 m, for (left) a single sill with hs = 30 m,\nshowing velocity u (cm s\u22121) and temperature field (\u00b0C, c.i. = 0.5\u00b0) at (a) t = 56\/8T, (b) t = 58\/8T,\n(c) t = 62\/8T, and also (right) two sills separated by L = 1.5 km.\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n4 of 21\nLK08, higher harmonics of the M2 tide are generated when\nU0\/(was) > 1, which is certainly true in this case and later\nexamined in detail. In addition, the parameter U\/N where\nU is taken as U0 or the across sill velocity determines the\namplitude of lee wave generation (LK08), which as shown\nby XD06, is appreciable in this case.\n[14] As the objective of the present paper is to determine\nhow internal tide generation, energy flux, and associated\nchange in Richardson number and mixing are influenced by\nthe presence of a second topographic feature, in our case the\nsill to the right of the first sill (Figure 1b), then in general\nonly the region to the right of the single sill will be exam-\nined in detail (Figure 2). However, initially the 50 km\ndomain on either side of the sill will be briefly considered to\ndetermine the spatial variability of the tide outside the region\nbetween the sills. In order to establish a near periodic tide\nthe model was \u201cspun up\u201d for seven tidal cycles, namely, to\nt = 7T with T the tidal period. The physical nature of the\ninternal tide generated over topography is that it propagates\naway from its generation point along beams on both sides\nof the sill and is subsequently reflected at the sea surface and\nseabed as it propagates away from its generation region\n(Figure 1a). This gives rise to regions of enhanced and\nreduced u current (Figure 1a) with a phase shift of 180\u00b0\nbetween surface and bottom currents, and a horizontal\nwavelength lh of about 27 km. The vertical phase shift\nof 180\u00b0 indicates a first mode internal tide, with wavelength\nlz = 2h, with h water depth. These values are in agreement\nwith those computed from the dispersion relation with w\nthe M2 tidal frequency, namely, the internal wave slope a\nis given by\n\u0003 \u00bc \u0001z\n\u0001h\n\u00bc !\n2 \u0002 f 2\nN2 \u0002 !2\n\u0005 \u00061=2\n: \u00f01\u00de\nConsequently, the solution is dominated by the first mode\nM2 internal tide, the horizontal wavelength of which\nexceeds the typical intersill separation considered here of up\nto L = 10 km (see section 5). However, for the higher\nharmonics of the tide their horizontal wavelengths are sig-\nnificantly smaller (see section 5) and can lie below this.\nIt is evident from Figure 1a that associated with this internal\ntide in the region away from the topography there are ver-\ntical displacement of the density surfaces produced by the\nFigure 3. (a) Subdomain of the sill region showing amplitude (cm s\u22121) of the u component of the bar-\noclinic velocity for the M2, M4, M6, M8, M10, and M12 tidal constituents, for a single sill with hs = 30 m.\n(b) As in Figure 3a but for phase (degrees). (c) As in Figure 3a but for contours of the amplitude of the\nvertical velocity w (cm s\u22121) (c.i. = 0.1).\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n5 of 21\ninternal tide. However, in the region of the sill topography\n(up to about 10 km either side of it) there are significant\nshort wave displacements associated with lee waves, as\npredicted by LK08 for steep topography (i.e., dh\/dx > w\/N),\nthe case here, and with an amplitude that scales as U\/N.\nIn addition, solitons are generated at the sill. In essence,\nas the barotropic tide flows over the sill, the density field is\ndisplaced and an internal tide is generated which propagates\nalong internal tidal beams away from the sill [Vlasenko\net al., 2005]. In addition, during flood tide unsteady lee\nwaves (wavelengths of order 100 m) and mixed tidal\u2010lee\nwaves [Nakamura et al., 2000; Nakamura and Awaji, 2001]\nare generated on the lee side of the sill. These waves are\nresponsible for the small\u2010scale displacement of the ther-\nmocline contours shown in Figures 1a and 2 up to 1000 m\ndownstream of the sill. Associated with the generation of\ninternal lee waves and tidal waves, there is significant\nmixing in the region of sills. To see how the internal waves\nand associated mixing are modified by the presence of a\nsecond sill, it is necessary to examine the near\u2010sill region in\ndetail and within a tidal cycle. For this region a \u201csnapshot\u201d\nof the solution was saved at every 1\/8T (Figure 2).\n[15] Consider the near\u2010sill region, in particular, the area\nbetween x = 0 and 2000 m, namely, the region which in the\ntwo sill case lies between the sills. It is evident in the single\u2010\nsill calculation (Figure 2a, t = 56\/8T) that at the end of the\nseventh tidal cycle when the baroclinic tide is fully devel-\noped and the across\u2010sill flow is near maximum, that lee\nwaves are present on the downstream side of the sill, as\nshown by the small\u2010scale (of order 100 m) displacements\nof the isotherms. In addition to the unsteady lee waves, a jet\nseparates from the sill, leading to an increase in midwater\ntidal velocity downstream of the sill. This jet is associated\nwith the high tidal flow over the sill and is characteristic of\nsill flows which for the parameters used here exhibit a\nmixed jet and wave like response (XD06) rather than the\nwavelike response found in the deep ocean (LK08). Asso-\nciated with this jet and the lee waves is an increase in\nmidwater mixing in the region of the sill. As time pro-\ngresses, the intensity of the jet increases, and at t = 58\/8T an\n}\nFigure 3. (continued)\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n6 of 21\nintense jet has separated from the top of the sill (Figure 2b).\nAs the tidal flow reverses, lee waves are formed on the left\u2010\nhand side of the sill (not presented). At t = 62\/8T (namely,\nhalf a tidal cycle following Figure 2b (t = 58\/8T)) a corre-\nsponding jet, although with current in the opposite direction,\nhas formed on the left\u2010hand side of the sill (Figure 2c). As\ndiscussed by Johnsson et al. [2007] and found here, the\ninternal response of the sill flow varies between internal wave\ngeneration (found at t = 56\/8T) and jet (found at t = 58\/8T\nand 62\/8T) depending upon flow over the sill.\n[16] To examine the spatial distribution of the internal tide\nat both the fundamental frequency and its higher harmonics\nand how this is subsequently influenced by the presence\nof a second sill (see section 3.2), a harmonic analysis of the\nu\u2010component of the baroclinic velocity on the right\u2010hand side\nof the sill was performed (Figures 3a and 3b). Only output at\nevery fifth model grid point was used in this harmonic\nanalysis. This is the reason why the topography of the sill\nappears to be poorly represented in Figure 3a. In reality, with\nDz = 1 m and Dx = 10 m as used in the model, together\nwith the shaved cell approach, the topography is accurately\nreproduced in the model. Figures 3a and 3b shows for the M2\ncomponent a region of surface intensified amplitude (of up to\n15 cm s\u22121) with decreasing surface amplitude with distance\ndownstream of the sill. At about midwater the tidal amplitude\nis near zero, with a slight increase at depth. The phase plot\n(Figure 3b) reveals a 180\u00b0 phase change in the vertical,\nshowing the presence of a first mode baroclinic internal tide.\nThis is consistent with the \u201cfar\u2010field\u201d distribution of the\ninternal tide shown in Figure 1a. Small\u2010scale spatial varia-\ntions in the amplitude and phase of the M2 component of the\ntide are evident in the near\u2010sill region in both Figures 1a\nand 3a and are due to some mixing occurring in the near\u2010\nsill region. Since this mixing is associated with the lee waves\nand the jet, then the buoyancy frequency will vary with space\nand time. A consequence of this is that the raypaths will\nbroaden and become less distinct in the near\u2010sill region. This\nis a very different situation than in the deep ocean (water\ndepths of order or exceeding 1000 m and barotropic tidal\nvelocities of order 10 cm s\u22121) where tidal velocity and mixing\nare appreciably less and raypaths are well defined [Legg and\nHuijts, 2006]. In essence, more well defined raypaths are\nevident in Figure 1a, in the regions away from the sill where\nthe mixing is reduced.\n[17] For the M4 component, regions of surface intensifi-\ncation are present, with corresponding local intensification\n(amplitude up to 8 cm s\u22121) at about middepth, suggesting\nthat a higher vertical mode is formed closer to the sill. This\nis supported by the phase change which varies rapidly\nthrough the vertical (Figure 3b). For the M6 and higher\nharmonics it is evident that there is some surface and mid-\nwater increase in amplitude, although the horizontal spatial\nvariability increases rapidly due to their shorter wavelength.\nIn addition, the phase distribution of these higher harmonics\nshows significant changes in the horizontal and vertical due\nto their shorter wavelength and the presence of higher\nmodes. Some weak beam\u2010like structures are evident in these\nhigher modes. From simple theory, the slope a of the ray-\npaths of the various harmonics can be computed using the\nformula given earlier, with N set at its initial value and w\ncorresponding to the M2 to M12 frequency. This gives slopes\nof 0.8%, 2.6%, 4.2%, 5.5%, 7.0%, and 8.4% for the M2 to\nFigure 3. (continued)\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n7 of 21\nM12 constituents. In practice, however, the mixing in the sill\nregion (XD06) leads to a broadening of these raypaths,\nwhich are less distinct than in the deep ocean [Legg and\nHuijts, 2006] where mixing is a minimum. In addition,\nclose to the sill region enhanced mixing changes the gen-\neration point for the various harmonics which together with\nwave\u2010wave interaction modifies their spatial distribution\nfrom that given by simple ray theory. It is evident from the\namplitude and phase distributions given in Figures 3a and\n3b that the higher harmonics have significantly shorter\nhorizontal and vertical wavelengths than the M2 tide.\n[18] Contours of the amplitude of the vertical velocity\n(Figure 3c) for the M2, M4, and M6 constituents reveal a\nmaximum at about z = \u221240 m close to the sill, with other\nweaker maxima occurring some distance away from the sill.\nThis suggests that the internal tide is generated close to the\ntop of the sill but decays with distance away from its gen-\neration point. This decay is more rapid than that found in the\ndeep (depths exceeding 1000 m) ocean [Lamb, 2004; Legg\nand Huijts, 2006] and is associated with the higher mixing\nin shallow regions due to increased barotropic tide, reduced\nwater depth, and, particularly in the sill region as discussed\npreviously, internal mixing due to lee waves and the jet\nthat separates from the sill. For the other higher harmonics,\nthe region of maximum vertical velocity is slightly farther\naway from the sill. This spatial variability in the vertical\nvelocity distribution reflects the spatial variability found in\nthe u current amplitude (Figure 3a). It is clear from Figure 3c\nFigure 4. Power spectra of the vertical velocity, integrated through depth, normalized with respect to the\nM2 tide at (a) x = 250 m and (b) x = 750 m in the single\u2010sill case. Also shown (c and d) are power spectra\n(at x = 250 m and 750 m, respectively) in the double\u2010sill case for L = 1.5 km. Tidal frequencies M2, M4,\nM6, and M8 and initial buoyancy frequency N0 are marked with arrows.\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n8 of 21\nthat the location of the position of maximum vertical velocity\nvaries between constituents over quite short distances. To\nquantify this and see how it is affected by the presence of a\nsecond sill, vertical velocity power spectra integrated over\nthe whole depth were computed at x = 250 m and 750 m\n(midway between sills when L = 1.5 km; see Figure 5).\nPower spectra at x = 250 m (Figure 4a) reveal that at this\nlocation, power at the M8, M10, and M12 frequencies is larger\nthan the M2, M4, or M6 frequency. At first sight this appears\nstrange in that one might expect maximum power at the\nfundamental (M2) frequency, since this is the forcing fre-\nquency, with other harmonics generated from it by flow over\nthe sill when U0\/(was) > 1 (LK08) and the nonlinear wave\u2010\nwave interaction. In addition. it has on average the largest u\u2010\ncurrent amplitude in the region (Figure 3a). However, for the\nw component of velocity its maximum amplitude occurs at\nabout x = 100 m, with a minimum for M2 at x = 250 m\n(Figure 3c), whereas there is a maximum at x = 250 m for\nM8, M10, and M12 tides (Figure 3c). At x = 750 m, the\nM2 component contains more power than the higher har-\nmonics (Figure 4b), due to the different spatial distributions\n(Figure 3c).\n[19] As discussed previously, although the model cannot\naccurately determine the level of mixing in the sill region, it\ncan show areas of critical Richardson number (taken here\nas values below 0.25 to be consistent with oceanographic\nmeasurements, although all values are given). In these\nregions there is the potential for enhanced mixing to occur.\nIt is evident from the tidally averaged distribution of\nRichardson numbers and temperature fields (Figure 5a) that\nthe temperature distribution at about midwater has changed\nfrom its initial distribution. This change occurs in the region\nof critical Richardson number (Figure 5a) and is associated\nwith enhanced mixing at about midwater. In order to quan-\ntify how much mixing has occurred over the first seven\ntidal cycles, the parameter DN = N2 \u2212 N02 was computed\n(Figure 5b), with N0 the initial buoyancy frequency and N\n2\nits tidally averaged value centered at t = 6.5T. By aver-\naging over a tidal cycle, changes in density due to tidal\nadvection can be removed. As the density field over the\nwhole domain is saved at 10 min intervals, this change in\ndensity is computed more accurately than is possible from\nobservations where only a limited number of locations and\ntime values are recorded.\n[20] Contours of DN (Figure 5b) clearly show that there\nhas been substantial midwater mixing at about z = \u221245 m on\neither side of the sill, as inferred from the change in tem-\nperature surfaces shown in Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c. This\nmixing is largest close to the sill and decreases with distance\ndownstream of it. The vertical location of this mixing cor-\nresponds to the region of largest vertical displacement\n(Figure 3c) and shear (as shown by the vertical phase change\n(Figure 3b)) of the M2 internal tide. In addition, it coincides\nwith the region of generation of higher harmonics of the tide\n(Figure 3a). The short wave nature of these tides and their\nslow propagation away from their generation region sug-\ngests that they may have a significant contribution to the\nmixing. The effect of this increase in midwater mixing is to\nreduce the vertical temperature gradient by mixing water\ninto the regions from above and below it, leading to local\nincreases in vertical temperature gradients and an increase\nin DN as shown in Figure 5b.\n3.2. Double\u2010Sill Calculation (Calc 2), Uo = 0.1 m s\n\u22121,\nhs = 30 m\n[21] For the calculation involving two sills separated by\nL = 1.5 km (Calc 2), a typical sill separation found in the\nRingdals Fjord\u2013Idefjord systems [Johnsson et al., 2007], it\nis evident that at t = 56\/8T (Figure 2a) a region of intensified\nu tidal current at z = \u221220 m has developed between the\ntwo sills. Such a tidal intensification was not found on the\nright\u2010hand side of the single sill (Calc 1, Figure 2a). In\naddition, the distribution of the isotherms on the right\u2010hand\nside of the left sill (namely, the sill located at x = 0 m)\nhas changed from that found in the single\u2010sill problem\n(Figure 2a). Similarly at t = 58\/8T (Figure 2b), although\nthere is an intense jet that leaves the top of the right\u2010hand\nsill (namely, the sill at x = 1500 m) which is comparable\nto that found in the single\u2010sill calculation, such a jet does not\noccur on the right\u2010hand side of the sill at x = 0. In essence,\nthe presence of the second sill inhibits the generation of this\nFigure 5. Subdomain of the sill region for the (left) single and (right) double sill cases, showing the\ntidally averaged temperature field (\u00b0C, c.i. = 0.5\u00b0) together with (a) the tidally averaged Richardson num-\nber and (b) the tidally averaged change in buoyancy frequency, DN = (N2 \u2212 N02) \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22122 with hs = 30 m.\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n9 of 21\njet. A similar effect occurs half a tidal cycle later (t = 62\/8T)\n(Figure 2c) where a jet occurs on the left\u2010hand side of the\nsill at x = 0), as in the single\u2010sill case (Figure 2c) although\nnot on the left\u2010hand side of the sill at x = 1500 m. In terms\nof the \u201cjet\u2010like\u201d response of the sill, this clearly shows that it\nhas been appreciably modified by the presence of the second\nsill. Since this \u201cjet\u2010like\u201d response is significant in deter-\nmining mixing in the near\u2010sill region, then this cannot\nsimply be determined by regarding it as the linear sum from\neach sill; their interaction is very important. Sill interaction\nin terms of the \u201cwave\u2010like\u201d response is considered later.\nIn terms of the \u201cfar\u2010field\u201d propagation of the internal tide\n(not presented), this is not substantially different from the\nsingle\u2010sill calculation, shown in Figure 1a. Consequently,\nthis change in the jet intensity in the intersill region com-\npared to the single\u2010sill calculation clearly shows that there is\ninteraction between the sills.\n[22] Contours of Richardson number and DN clearly show\n(Figures 5a and 5b) that the change in the initial and final\ndensity field in the region between the sills in the two sill\ncalculation is different to that found with one sill. In par-\nticular, comparison of the Richardson number distributions\nbetween the one\u2010 and two\u2010sill cases shows that the region of\ncritical Richardson number between the sills has increased\nin the two\u2010sill calculation. In addition, the midwater sepa-\nration of the isotherms has increased, as shown in the DN\ndistributions (Figure 5b). Contours of DN (Figure 5b) over\nthe seventh tidal cycle show that there has been a substantial\nincrease in midwater (centered at z = \u221245 m) mixing\nbetween the two sills (Figure 5b), compared to the single\u2010\nsill case. Not only is the mixing increased but its horizontal\nspatial distribution between the sills is uniform compared to\nthe single\u2010sill case. However, outside the region between the\nsills it decays with distance from the sill. This distribution\nis consistent with the single\u2010sill case. Figures 5a and 5b\nclearly show that there is significant interaction between\nthe two sills, which influences the current and mixing\nbetween the sills, although the \u201cfar\u2010field\u201d large\u2010scale inter-\nnal tide response and even the jet on the outer sides of the\nsills is not significantly influenced by the presence of one or\ntwo sills. The extent to which the mixing between the sills is\ninfluenced by the presence of the second sill is examined\nlater in more detail in terms of the sill separation distance.\n[23] Since the \u201couter solution,\u201d namely, that beyond the\ntwo sills, is not influenced by the presence of the second sill,\nwe will consider here the \u201cinner solution,\u201d namely, that\nbetween the sill and the spatial distribution of tidal harmo-\nnics in the region, namely, the \u201cwave\u2010like\u201d response to the\nFigure 6.

Unlike in the single\u2010sill calcu-\nlation where the u current amplitude at the M2 frequency in\nthe surface layer was a maximum close to the sill at x = 0\n(Figure 3a), in the two\u2010sill case the maximum is between the\nsills, although still at the sea surface (Figure 6a). As pre-\nviously (Figure 3a), there is a midwater region where the\nM2 internal tide is near zero (although this has been dis-\nplaced slightly upward in the vertical; compare Figures 3a\nand 6a). Below this the u current amplitude is of the order\nof 10 cm s\u22121, reducing as the near\u2010bed region is approached\n(Figure 6a). This suggests a vertical structure composed of\nboth first and second internal modes. However, a 180\u00b0 phase\nchange in the vertical was found for the M2 tide (Figure 6b),\nsuggesting that the first mode dominated. For the higher\nharmonics of the tide, there are significant phase changes\nin the vertical (Figure 6b), showing the presence of higher\nvertical modes.\n[24] The M2, M6, and M10 harmonics exhibited a maxi-\nmum u current amplitude at x = 750 m, midway between the\ntwo sills, although the vertical position of this changes from\nsurface (M2 and M6) to bed (M10). In the case of the other\nharmonics, namely, M4, M8, and M12, they are zero along\nthe centerline. This suggests constructive and destructive\ninterference of the internal waves that propagate from each\nsill, in a similar manner to internal seiche motion in a lake\n[Hall and Davies, 2005]. A set of standing internal waves is\ngenerated, with the first horizontal mode (the internal M2\ntide) having a maximum at the midpoint between the sills.\nThe second mode (M4 tide) has a minimum at x = 750 m,\nbetween the two maxima that appear close to the sill top.\nHigher modes with alternate maxima (M6, M10, etc.) and\nminima (M8, M12, etc.) at x = 750 m and an increasing\nnumber of maxima and minima in the horizontal are evident\n(Figure 6a). Associated with these horizontal modes are\nvertical modes of increasing vertical structure (Figure 6a).\nIn summary, in the case of the higher harmonics of the M2\ntide, they show appreciable horizontal and vertical variability\nreflecting their shorter wavelength and generation of higher\nvertical modes. In essence, propagating internal waves from\neach sill combine to form a standing internal wave.\n[25] Associated with the standing wave, there is a nodal\npoint in w at the center of the basin region between the sills\nwhere u is a maximum for the frequency M2n, with n odd.\nThis is evident in the power spectra of w at the center of the\nregion (Figure 4d) where there is no peak at the M2, M6,\nM10, etc., frequency. This is appreciably different to that\nFigure 6. (continued)\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n11 of 21\nfound previously (Figure 4b) where there was energy at all\nhigher harmonics of M2.\n[26] As in the single\u2010sill case, power spectra show a\ndropoff in energy at higher frequencies than those asso-\nciated with the internal tide. For spectra close to the sill, i.e.,\nx = 250 (Figure 4c), there is an increase at the lee wave\nperiod (with frequency of order 70 times M2 tidal and close\nto the initial buoyancy frequency N0, as marked in Figure 4).\nIn addition, there is less energy in the overall internal wave\nspectrum for the two sill than the one\u2010sill problem. This will\nbe considered later in terms of a comparison of energy flux\ncalculations for the one\u2010 and two\u2010sill cases.\n[27] The change in nature of the internal tide between\nthe sills from a progressive to standing wave, due to wave\nreflection from each sill, suggests a possible mechanism for\nthe enhanced mixing found between sills [Johnsson et al.,\n2007]. Associated with internal wave reflection, as occurs\nhere to form a standing wave, Eriksen [1985] showed there\nis a significant increase in vertical shear and associated\nmixing. In the present case, short wave higher harmonics of\nthe internal tide are generated and \u201ccaptured\u201d between the\nsills. Consequently, internal wave energy cannot propagate\naway from the intersill region, giving rise to a region of\nreduced Richardson number (Figure 5b). The region where\nthe Richardson number falls below its critical value and\nhence there is enhanced mixing (quantified by the DN dis-\ntribution) is increased compared to the single\u2010sill case (see\nFigures 5a and 5b). Hence the generation of short waves that\nFigure 7.

In section 5 the effect of intersill separation distance\nL upon the magnitude of short waves and hence the level of\nmixing is considered in terms of resonance.\n3.3. Effect of Sill Height and Tidal Velocity\n[28] Here the effect of sill depth (hs) and tidal velocity\n(U0) is very briefly considered. More detailed studies of the\nresponse of a single sill [e.g., Baines, 1995; XD06; XD07;\nLK08] have shown that since these affect the Froude\nnumber, they also influence the internal tide and mixing at a\nsingle sill. By briefly examining the two\u2010sill response to the\nrange of parameters that usually occurs in two sill situations,\nthe generality of the previous results can be considered.\n3.3.1. Double\u2010Sill Calculation (Reduced Sill Depth)\n(Calc 3), Uo = 0.1 m s\n\u22121, hs = 15 m\n[29] For a single sill the effect of reducing hs to 15 m,\nwhile maintaining Uo = 0.1 m s\n\u22121, is to appreciably increase\nthe across sill Froude number Fs = Us\/Nhs, giving rise to a\nlarger hydraulic transition, and appreciable overturning and\nmixing in the upper part of the water column.\n[30] In the double\u2010sill case the hydraulic transition that\noccurred in the single\u2010sill case is not present. This suggests\nthat interaction increases as Fr increases, leading as before to\nmore mixing in the two\u2010sill case than in the one\u2010sill case.\n3.3.2. Double\u2010Sill Calculation (Calc 4) (Reduced\nForcing), Uo = 0.05 m s\n\u22121, hs = 15 m\n[31] To examine a reduction in Froude number and U\/h,\nwhile still maintaining a shallow sill depth, the tidal forcing\nwas reduced to Uo = 0.05 m s\n\u22121 with a substantial decrease\nin lee waves (see LK0; K10) and mixing. However, as in\nearlier calculations the presence of the second sill leads to a\nstanding wave internal tide and an associated change in\nmixing, which modifies the distribution of internal tidal\nbeams and hence the internal tide.\n[32] In the case of the sill depth hs = 15 m, power spectra\n(Figure 7a and 7b) show appreciably less power in the\nlower\u2010frequency tidal harmonic range of the spectrum, with\na peak at the lee wave frequency. This is consistent with\nDX06, who found that for a steep sill (the case considered\nhere) as hs decreased, leading to an increased across sill\nvelocity Us and hence Us\/N, the energy in the lee wave\nband increased compared to that in the internal wave band\nand mixing was enhanced. This increase in lee wave energy\nin the sill region (DX06) with Us\/N is consistent with\nthe oceanic solutions of LK08 and K10. As in the other\ncalculations there are only peaks at the Mn2, for n even, at\nx = 750 m. In essence, as sill height is increased, reducing\nsill depth hs, more of the barotropic tidal energy is converted\ninto lee wave energy than internal tide energy.\n3.3.3. Double\u2010Sill Calculation (Calc 5) (Increased Sill\nDepth), Uo = 0.1 m s\n\u22121, hs = 60 m\n[33] The effect of an increased sill depth, hs = 60 m while\nmaintaining Uo = 0.1 m s\n\u22121 is to slightly reduce the maxi-\nmum across sill velocity and hence the parameter Us\/N. This\nleads to a decrease in lee wave activity and mixing on the\nlee side of the sill (not shown), compared to previously\n(Figures 5a and 5b).\n[34] Contours of the amplitude of the u component of the\nM2 internal tide (not presented) show that unlike in previous\ntwo\u2010sill calculations (Calcs 2, 3, 4) it is a maximum at\ndepth, just above the seabed, compared with the surface\nmaximum shown previously (see Figure 6). This suggests\nthat the M2 internal tidal energy propagates downward.\nHowever, in the sill area and near the surface there are\nregions of increased amplitude associated with upward\npropagating internal tidal energy. At the M4 frequency there\nare local sea surface maxima slightly offset from the top of\neach sill. Associated with these maxima are others at iden-\ntical horizontal positions but farther down in the water\ncolumn, suggesting that high vertical modes are present at\nthese positions.\n[35] As for hs = 30 m, power spectra of the vertical\nvelocity at x = 250 m and 750 m showed the presence of\nenergy at all tidal harmonics at x = 250 m (Figure 7c) and\nonly at Mn2 (for n even) at x = 750 m (Figure 7d). The\ndecrease in Us and Fs, diminished lee wave generation as\nshown by the reduction in the energy peak at about 70 wm2\n(compare Figures 4c and 7c). This also gave rise to a\nreduction in vertical mixing. As previously, there was still\nappreciable interaction between the two sills.\n4. Influence of Sill Separation (L) Upon\nthe Internal Tide and Energy Flux\n4.1. Influence of Sill Separation Upon Internal Waves\n[36] In section 3 the separation between the sills was fixed\nat L = 1.5 km, and the influence of hs, Us\/N and Fr was\nexamined. Here the influence of sill separation L, is examined\nfor the case in which hs = 30 m with Uo = 0.1 ms\n\u22121, and with\nL taking values of 2.5 km, 5.0 km, and 10.0 km. As before,\nthe domain between x = 0 and 2000 m is considered in detail.\n[37] As previously, when L = 1.5 km (Calc 2) the effect of\nthe second sill at L = 2.5 km (Calc 6) is to modify the lee\nwave response on the right\u2010hand side of the sill at x = 0\ncompared with the single\u2010sill calculation (e.g., see solutions\nat t = 56\/8T, Figure 8a (L = 2.5 km) and Figure 2a). This\nclearly shows that there is interaction between the sills\neven when L = 2.5 km that influences not only the internal\ntide response but also the lee wave intensity. In addition, the\nstrong jet that leaves the sill top at t = 58\/8T in the single\u2010sill\ncase (Figure 2b) is no longer present. At other times the\nsolution (not presented) is comparable to that computed with\nL = 1.5 km, although the midwater mixing is reduced.\n[38] As the sill separation is increased to L = 5.0 km\n(Calc 7), the solution at t = 56\/8T in the region of the sill at\nx = 0 shows (Figure 8b) a similar vertical displacement of\nthe isopycnals and currents associated with the lee waves to\nthose found in the single\u2010sill case (Figure 2a). In addition\nat t = 58\/8T (not presented) a weak jet is evident that\nseparates from the top of the sill. In terms of the \u201couter\nregion\u201d distribution of the M2 internal tide (not presented),\nthis is not significantly influenced by the sill separation\ndistance L.\n[39] When the sill separation is increased to L = 10 km,\nit is evident from Figures 8c and 2a that although the lee\nwave distribution adjacent to the sill is comparable to the\nsingle\u2010sill case (Figure 2a), the near\u2010surface tidal current\naway from the sill is appreciably increased. A significant\nenhancement in surface current compared to the single\u2010\nsill calculation is evident at t = 58\/8 T with a marked\nreduction in the intensity of the jet leaving the top of the sill\n(not presented). The reason for these changes in the tidal\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n13 of 21\ndistribution at the sill can be appreciated from the \u201cfar\u2010field\u201d\n\u201csnapshot\u201d picture of the tide (Figure 1b). Calculations\nshowed that an increase in L from 1.5 km to 5 km only has a\nsmall effect upon the \u201cfar field\u201d tidal distribution. However,\nwhen L is increased from 5 km to 10 km this \u201cfar\u2010field\u201d\ndistribution changes with an associated increase in the\nintensity of the internal tide between the two sills (see\nFigure 1b). This implies that when the sill separation L\nis small (of order less than 5 km) compared to the hori-\nzontal wavelengths of the internal tide (of order 25 km),\nthen the influence of the two sills upon the \u201cfar\u2010field\u201d tidal\ndistribution is small. However, when L = 10 km, the internal\nFigure 8.

However, the energy distribution\nbetween the various harmonics does vary depending upon\nintersill separation distance L (compare Figures 4d and 9).\nThis suggests that depending upon the value of L, the mag-\nnitude of a particular constituent may increase or decrease\ndue to resonance. This is considered later in the paper.\n4.2. Influence of Sill Separation Upon Energy Flux\n[41] To quantify the extent to which the sill separation\ndistance L influences the interaction between the sills, ver-\ntically integrated values of the energy flux (Figure 10a) and\nits divergence (Figure 10b) were derived by time averaging\nover tidal cycles seven and eight. Owing to dissipation\nbetween the sills, which is shown by Johnsson et al. [2007]\nto be significant, then in the limit as L increases, interaction\nbetween the sills will be reduced, and the energy flux from\neach sill will approach that of an isolated sill. Calculations\nwere performed for a single sill and double sill for L = 1.5,\n2, 2.5, 5, and 10 km. In these calculations the sill depth\nhs = 30 m. Since the internal wave energy flux is directed\naway from the sill, then in the two\u2010sill case the energy flux\nis antisymmetric with respect to the center point between\nthe sills, namely, x = 750 m for L = 1.5 km (Figure 10a),\nwith the energy flux divergence symmetric about this point,\nand having a maximum close to each of the sills. These\ndistributions were also found as L was increased, but since\nonly the 1500 m region on the right of the first sill (i.e., that\nat x = 0) is given in Figures 10a and 10b, it is not evident.\nHowever, Figures 10a and 10b clearly show that as L is\nincreased the magnitude of the energy flux and its diver-\ngence increase, approaching the single\u2010sill value, as to be\nexpected in the limit that L goes to infinity.\n[42] If there was no interaction between the sills, then the\nenergy flux in the region between them could be obtained by\na simple linear combination of that due to each sill, taking\naccount of the direction of the flux. Considering initially the\ncase of L = 1.5 km (Figure 11a) in the region away from\neach sill, this linear approximation is in good agreement\nwith that found in the two sill calculation and shows a linear\ndecay with distance from each sill. However, in the near\u2010sill\nregion where nonlinear effects are important and there is a\nsignificant conversion of energy into the internal tide, this\nlinear superposition is invalid. Obviously, as L increases\nthe linear superposition becomes more valid, as shown by\nthe decrease in the energy flux error (difference between the\ntrue solution and linear combination) at x = 0 as L increases\nfrom 1.5 km to 5 km (Figures 11a, 11b, and 11c). This\nsuggests that in terms of energy conversion from the bar-\noclinic tide to mixing in the near\u2010sill region, it is important to\naccount for how it is affected by the presence of the second\nsill and not to linearly combine each separate sill solution.\n4.3. Influence of Sill Separation Upon Mixing\n[43] Although the calculation of how the energy flux\nvaries with separation L reveals the degree of nonlinear\ninteraction, in the work of Johnsson et al. [2007] the\nemphasis was placed on mixing in the midwater region.\nTo examine how this changes as L varies, it is valuable\nFigure 11.

These changes are clearly\nevident from the DN distributions and temperature contours\nshown in Figures 12a, 12b, and 12c. From a comparison of\nDN distributions between x = 0 and 750 m in Figures 12a\n(single sill) and Figure 12b (sill at 5 km), it is evident that\nthere are no substantial differences, although the effect\nof the second sill is seen in the region from x = 1500\nto 2000 m. However, when L is reduced to 2000 m\n(Figure 12c), there is enhanced mixing in the region of the\nfirst sill due to its presence. In essence, the mixing at the\nfirst sill is increased nearly twofold due to the presence\nof the second sill. This clearly shows that for values of L of\norder 5 km or above, total mixing can be computed as the\nlinear sum of that due to each sill as in the work of Johnsson\net al. [2007]. However, below this value this is not possible\ndue to interaction.\n5. Resonant Effects\n[45] As discussed previously, for a first mode baroclinic\ntide at the M2 period the horizontal wavelength for the\nparameters used here is of the order of 27 km. Conse-\nquently, for the typical sill separations considered here, i.e.,\nup to 10 km, the M2 wavelength far exceeds the intersill\ndistance. However, for higher harmonics of the tide, the\nhorizontal wavelength of the first mode is 4.94 km (M6),\n3.64 (M8), and 2.88 km (M10) and hence shorter than the\nintersill separation. Since it is the shorter\u2010wavelength waves\nwhich are most prone to breaking and hence contribute most\nto the mixing, then it is instructive to examine the extent to\nwhich these are amplified by trapping between the sills. As\nshown earlier, the power spectra (Figures 4d and 9) show\nthat the amplitude of the various harmonics changes as L is\nvaried. This suggests a resonant type amplification when the\nintersill separation is varied as a factor of the first mode\nhorizontal wavelength. This is illustrated here for the M10\ncomponent of the tide, although the other harmonics exhibit\ncomparable effects. It is evident from Figure 6, in particular,\nthe phase distribution in the vertical, that when M10 is gen-\nerated from the M2 tide that besides the first mode, higher\nvertical modes are produced with associated shorter wave-\nlengths. In addition, as shown previously, there is extensive\nmixing in the problem and this will change the internal\nwavelength and lead to a broadening of any resonance fre-\nquency and the raypaths of internal tide propagation. This in\nturn will reduce internal tide focusing and the concentration\nof energy on wave attractors [Maas and Lam, 1995]. In order\nto minimize these effects and clearly illustrate how variations\nin intersill separation can enhance internal wave energy, it is\nnecessary ideally to generate just a first mode baroclinic\ninternal tide in the absence of other harmonics and modes. To\nthis end, the model domain, stratification, and water depth\nwere as previously but the body force was applied at the M10\nrather than the M2 frequency. In addition, its amplitude U0\nwas reduced to 0.02 ms\u22121 in order to minimize nonlinear\neffects, and hence the generation of short internal waves,\nwith associated nonlinear effects and mixing.\n[46] A snapshot of the current field and temperature\ndistribution after 20 M10 tidal cycles for a single sill\nFigure 14. Subdomain of the sill region, showing ampli-\ntude of the M10 harmonic for (a) a single sill, and two sills\nseparated by (b) L = 1.44 km, R = 0.5, (c) L = 2.16 km, R =\n0.75, (d) L = 2.88 km, R = 1.0, where R = L\/lh, with lh the\nhorizontal wavelength of the M10 harmonic.\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n18 of 21\n(Figure 13a) shows that this approach has been fairly suc-\ncessful, in that tidal beams corresponding to a first mode\nbaroclinic internal tide of wavelength 2.88 km are generated\non either side of the sill. However, isotherms close to the\nsill show the presence of short waves, and the broadening of\nthe tidal beams suggests that mixing and damping have\noccurred as the internal tide propagates away from the\ngeneration region. A harmonic analysis of the u current in\nthe near\u2010sill region (Figure 14a, phase not shown) shows\nthe presence of a first mode wave, having a wavelength of\norder 3 km.\n[47] In a subsequent calculation a second sill was placed\nat L = 1.44 km (i.e., half the M10 wavelength). From the\nsnapshot (Figure 13b) it is evident that this increases the\nmagnitude of the near\u2010bottom current in the intersill region.\nIn addition, there is more short wave generation and mixing\ngiving rise to broader tidal beams (Figure 13b). This sug-\ngests that there may be more focusing of the internal tidal\nwave in the intersill region, giving rise to stronger currents.\nThe intensification of the current in the near\u2010bed region\nwas confirmed by the harmonic analysis (Figure 14b).\nThis shows a significantly stronger current amplitude than\nfound in the single\u2010sill case, namely, 32.6 cm s\u22121 compared\nto 7.7 cm s\u22121, confirming that at these distances short internal\nwave energy is trapped between the sills and there is signif-\nicant interaction between these short\u2010wavelength waves.\n[48] To examine to what extent the ratio R = L\/lh, with\nlh the horizontal wavelength of the M10 constituent influ-\nences the magnitude of current amplitude, and hence when\nfocusing may occur leading to a peak in current magnitude,\ncalculations were performed with a range of R values. For\neach R value the maximum u current amplitude (Umax) was\ndetermined in the intersill region, and this was plotted\nagainst R (Figure 15). It is evident from Figures 14b\u201314d\nthat the position of this value varied depending upon R.\nFrom Figure 15 it is apparent that a maximum value of Umax\noccurs when R = 0.5. In this case the two sills are close,\nthere is little energy loss by damping, and the tidal beams\nappear more focused and constructively interfere with each\nother to give a single maxima in the near\u2010bed region\nbetween the sills (Figure 14b). At R = 0.75 a more complex\ndistribution occurs (Figure 14c) with the maximum in the\nsurface layer and some evidence of higher vertical modes.\nThe distribution at R = 1.0 (Figure 14d) is comparable to\nthat found at R = 0.5 (Figure 14b) although with a signifi-\ncantly reduced amplitude. It is apparent from Figure 15 that\nthe next maximum amplitude occurs at R = 1.5. This is\nassociated with the presence of higher horizontal and ver-\ntical modes (not shown).\n[49] Further increases in L show (Figure 15) that Umax is a\nmaximum for R = 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5, suggesting that reso-\nnance is occurring as the internal tides generated at each sill\nconstructively interfere with each other and there appears to\nbe some wave focusing. The damping of internal wave\nenergy due to viscous and diffuse effects, and the fact that\nmixing is occurring in the intersill region means that the\ntidal energy beams are not as highly focused as in the\nanalytical work of Nycander [2005, 2006] and Balmforth\nand Peacock [2009]. Consequently, the focusing of beams\nalong attractors is much more diffuse than in the work of\nMaas and Lam [1995] and Drijfhout and Maas [2007].\nHowever, Figure 15 shows that for integer R values the\nUmax is a minimum while at in\u2010between values it is a\nmaximum. The extent to which focusing of internal tide\nenergy along attractors leads to enhancement of internal tide\nenergy at certain intersill separations L is difficult to clearly\nestablish, although there are clear peaks and troughs in the\nU amplitude as L changes. In addition, the focusing of\ninternal tides means that the tidal beams in these regions will\nconstructively interfere with each other, leading to Umax\nvalues that are never less than those found in the single\u2010sill\ncase. This appears to occur here where Umax in Figure 15\nnever falls below the single sill value.\n6. Summary and Conclusions\n[50] Calculations have been performed using idealized\ntopography and sills in a loch\/fjord region to determine the\ninfluence of sill depth hs, tidal current U0, and sill separation\nL upon tidally forced internal wave generation in the region.\nIn all cases the water depth h and initial buoyancy frequency\nN were fixed, although hs and tidal forcing varied. Initial\ncalculations using a single sill showed that for small values\nof hs, of order 15 m, strong lee waves, a tidal jet, and sig-\nnificant mixing occurred on the lee side of a sill. As sill\ndepth was increased, the lee wave signal and internal mixing\nwas reduced, although a significant internal tide at the M2\nfrequency was still produced, and gave rise to an appre-\nciable energy flux away from the sill. In addition to the\nfundamental (M2 component) tide, higher harmonics with\nFigure 15. Maximum M10 U current amplitude (Umax) (cm s\n\u22121) for various values of R = L\/lh, with\nlh the horizontal wavelength of the M10 harmonic.\nXING AND DAVIES: INTERNAL TIDES C04022C04022\n19 of 21\na shorter horizontal and vertical wavelength were generated.\nTheir intensity and spatial distribution were examined using\npower spectra of the vertical velocity.\n[51] The introduction of a second sill gave rise to standing\ninternal tidal waves in the region between the two sills.\nCalculations showed that the spatial distribution of the u\ncurrent magnitude and phase associated with this wave\nvaried from one harmonic to another. In the case of the\nfundamental (M2 frequency) and high harmonics (M2n for n\nodd) the u baroclinic current had a maximum amplitude\nmidway between the sills, with an associated nodal point\nin the vertical velocity, typical of standing internal waves.\nThe vertical variation of the M2 tide was characterized by\na first mode baroclinic wave, although higher harmonics\nexhibited higher modes in the vertical. For higher harmo-\nnics, namely, M2n (n even), the baroclinic u current ampli-\ntude was zero at the midpoint, with the vertical velocity\nnonzero. Again these harmonics showed significant hori-\nzontal and vertical variability in their amplitude, revealing\nthe presence of high vertical modes.\n[52] The spatial distribution of baroclinic u current max-\nima was influenced by sill height hs and separation L. In\naddition to producing a standing internal wave between the\ntwo sills, the presence of a second sill gave rise to an\nenhancement in the region where the Richardson number\nwas critical, resulting in an increase in vertical mixing\nbetween the sills. This arose because internal tide energy\nwas trapped between the sills. In addition, with the reflec-\ntion of the internal tide from each sill, there was an increase\nin shear and mixing. Also, there was a nonlinear cascade of\nenergy to higher frequencies with a resulting increase in\nmixing. This goes some way to explaining the enhanced\nvertical mixing observed in fjords in the region between\nclosely spaced sills [Johnsson et al., 2007].\n[53] Calculations of energy flux and its divergence\nshowed that in the single\u2010sill case internal waves were\ngenerated near the sill top, with a near\u2010constant energy flux\naway from this region. This was reflected in the rapid\nincrease in energy flux divergence at the top of the sill slope,\nin the generation region and its near\u2010zero value away from\nthe sill. The magnitude of the energy flux and its maximum\ndivergence decreased as sill depth increased. In the two\u2010sill\ncase, the magnitude of the energy flux and its divergence for\nall values of hs was reduced compared to the single\u2010sill case.\nThis arose because of the change in the baroclinic internal\nwave from progressive to standing. However, as the sill\nseparation distance L increased, then the energy flux and its\ndivergence approached that found in the single\u2010sill case, as\nwould be expected in the limit as L tended to infinity. Com-\nparing the intersill energy flux derived by linearly combining\nthat from two separate sills with that computed from the two\u2010\nsill problem showed that there was significant interaction\nin the region of the sills, although this reduced as sill sepa-\nration increased. Similarly, the mixing and dissipation in the\nintersill region showed appreciable nonlinear interaction,\nalthough this reduced as intersill distance increased.\n[54] In essence, the calculations presented here show that\nfor two closely spaced sills the generation of a standing\ninternal tide and its higher harmonics gives rise to increased\nmixing between the sills as found in observations. As sill\nseparation approaches the wavelength of the internal tide, this\neffect decreases. In a final section the influence of intersill\nseparation upon the intensity of the internal tide in the\nintersill region was briefly examined. For the sill separations\nconsidered here, these were much shorter than the wave-\nlength of the M2 baroclinic tide, although larger than some\nof its higher harmonics, with the M10 constituent showing\nsome local intensification. For this reason, and in view of\nthe fact that the short waves contribute most to mixing, the\ninfluence of intersill separation upon the amplitude of the\nM10 tidal current was examined in detail to determine how it\nwas modified from a progressive to standing wave by the\npresence of a second sill and intensified by focusing.\n[55] In deep\u2010ocean situations, tidal beams are very narrow\nand well defined. Under these conditions the energy in the\nbeam can be focused along attractors giving rise to locations\nof increased internal tidal energy. This suggests that for\nnarrow beams as the topographic separation varies as in a\ndouble\u2010ridge case [Chao et al., 2007], then for a given tidal\nforcing frequency, sill profile, and stratification, the internal\ntide amplitude will increase and a sharp peak resonance\nwill occur. In the present case the beams are too diffuse and\na more broadband type resonance occurs. This has been\nillustrated here for the M10 constituent and a given stratifi-\ncation and water depth. In order to understand the process in\nmore detail. a comprehensive set of calculations is required,\nwhich is beyond the scope of this paper.\n[56] Acknowledgments. The authors are indebted to R. A.
