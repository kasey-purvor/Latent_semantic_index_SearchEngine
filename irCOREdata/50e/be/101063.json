In this letter, we report\nthe fabrication of submicron glass columns on the surface of\nfused quartz. These etched features are reproducible, al-\nthough the process requires further study to enable accurate\ncontrol of all parameters.\nRIE of quartz samples was conducted using a combined\nradio frequency and microwave plasma system operating at\n160 W ~2380 V self-bias! and 600 W, for the rf and micro-\nwave sources, respectively, and described previously.3 The\netching was carried out at a typical rate of ;30 nm\/min,\nusing electronic grade CF4 \/Ar plasma that contains 37%\nCF4 . Several very fine ~VF! grade fused quartz samples\nmounted onto the same stage were etched in runs of 30\u201360\nmin, using an aluminum contact mask onto which 0.534 mm\ntrenches are defined. The specimens processed were cleaned\nusing acetone, methanol, isopropanol, and deionized water to\nremove nonvolatile debris from the surface. The etch depths\nand rms surface roughness were measured using a surface\nprofilometer, with a resolution better than 1 nm, giving\ndepths of 2.860.2 and 8.460.3 mm for samples etched for\n1.5 and 5 h, respectively. The surface topography was inves-\ntigated by scanning electron microscopy ~SEM!, while the\nchemical composition was determined by energy dispersive\nx-ray analysis @~EDX! with a detection threshold of 0.2 wt %\nfor all elements#. The reflectance was measured at 15\u00b0 and\n45\u00b0 detector collection angles, arbitrarily chosen.\nThe surface features observed on fused quartz substrates\nafter 5 and 1.5 h reactive ion etching are shown in Figs. 1~a!\nand 1~b! and are well defined with regular geometric shape.\nThese micron sized columns, which we call \u2018\u2018rods,\u2019\u2019 can be\nfabricated on very flat and smooth fused quartz surfaces. The\nroot-mean-square ~rms! roughness of the surface between the\nrods was measured to be better than 65 nm, which is much\nless than the 69 nm of the reference-unetched samples. The\nwell-defined rods are only located in the regions neighboring\nthe two rounded edges of the etched trenches and their char-\nacteristics are summarized in Table I. The samples etched for\n1.5 h @Fig. 1~b!# show two truncated conelike structures of\n1.460.2 and 0.8460.1 mm height with shallow recesses on\na!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; present address:\nUniversity of Durham, School of Engineering, Durham DH1 3LE, UK;\nelectronic mail: d.a.zeze@durham.ac.uk\nFIG. 1.

After 5 h of etching, the features become\ncylindrical rods ~3.760.2 mm high and nearly identical! and\nthe recess at the top surface is also seen in all features, Fig.\n1~a!. The density of these rodlike features, estimated at ;6\n3107 and ;0.73107 cm22 for 1.5 and 5 h etched samples,\ncan be controlled by varying the elongation of the trenches\nand the process time. The average density of the specimens\netched for 5 h ~calculated taking a similar surface area for\nboth sets of samples!, is an order of magnitude lower than\nthat of those etched for 1.5 h as smaller rods sitting between\nlarger ones are etched away after 5 h. The aspect ratio and\nthe etch profile of the samples for various times were esti-\nmated using the evaluation software of the SEM system to\ndetermine the height, width, and taper angle of the rods. The\ntaper angle was estimated to be ;100\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 for samples\netched for 1.5 and 5 h, respectively. This corresponds to an\naspect ratio better than 100:1, clearly indicating that near-\ncylindrical rods are produced. This work demonstrates that\nvery high aspect ratio structures can be produced by RIE\nwithout resorting to photolithographic definition of the fea-\ntures, in contrast to Auciello et al.,4 who produced silicon\nposts for field emission display applications using conven-\ntional photolithography and RIE. The rods described here\nwere produced by monitoring carefully the etching process\nparameters, e.g., gas mixture, self-bias, process time, etch\nrate, given the structural properties of the fused quartz sub-\nstrates. This etching produces a relatively flat surface in the\nmiddle of the trenches where no distinct rod structures are\nfound and ;40610 and 150620 nm rms surface roughness\nwere measured after 1.5 and 5 h, respectively. Interestingly,\nthe rms roughness of the middle of the trench scales linearly\nwith time while the rms roughness of the surface between\nrods does not scale in this manner. The fact no significant\nx-ray diffraction peak was observed under glancing angle\nanalysis suggests that rods of various sizes may be separated\nby amorphous material. The presence of rods only in the\nrounded corners indicates a difference in the etch rate in this\nregion ~Table I!.\nThe fused quartz trace element data provided by the\nmanufacturer indicate that the SiO2 matrix primarily contains\nAl, Na, and Ca, and differ from the experimental trace ele-\nments found here ~Table II!. The presence of these impurities\nmay play a role in the formation of the rods since they can\nalter the basic quartz matrix and its properties. A nonuniform\ndistribution of the impurities would induce a degree of dif-\nference in the selectivity and etch rates at local domains.\nThese impurities include those produced by the etching pro-\ncess and the residues sputtered off the mask, e.g., fluorine,\nargon, carbon, and mask metal. Indeed, Fig. 2 compares the\ntypical EDX spectra of the rods ~spectrum 1! and that of the\nunderlying surface ~spectrum 2!, shown on the inset SEM\nimage. These spectra provide the evidence of the presence of\nthe impurities and their nonuniform distribution across the\nsubstrate. Impurities, such as Cr ~0.14 at. %!, Fe ~0.76 at. %!,\nand Ni ~0.05 at. %!, are mostly concentrated in the rods while\nthe underlying surface essentially contains SiO2 . Note that\nAl, Mg, F, etc., are also present in the rods at a lower-energy\nrange. The presence of residual fluorine is a direct conse-\nquence of the etching process. However, metallic impurities\ncan act as localized nanoscale masks when they aggregate\nrandomly in the etched trenches, inducing local differences\nin selectivity. Therefore, the nonuniform distribution of the\nimpurities across the substrate plays a major role in the dif-\nferential etching.\nThe presence of well-defined rods observed in the\nrounded corners only, suggests a difference in the distribu-\ntion of electrical field across the trench. The distribution of\nthe electrical field around the edges of the trenches, was\nsimulated using finite element analysis solving either\nLaplace\u2019s or Poisson\u2019s equations for metallic or dielectric\nsubstrates.

Further away from the rounded corners, the field\nconcentration decreases as three different b values are ob-\nserved for C>5 @Fig. 3~a!# whereas only one zone is seen for\nC50.55 @Fig. 3~b!#. b greater than 1.0 is due to the differ-\nences in conductivity and the lower-field penetration in the\nmetal mask. Recently, Macak et al.5 have also shown that the\nedge-related effects have a significant influence on the mor-\nphology, composition and thickness during deposition. High-\nfield enhancement at the edges affect the ion flux and angle\nof incidence during the process, therefore, one cannot dis-\ncount the contribution of the edge effects in the localized\ndifferential etching that takes place. As a result, the combi-\nnation of the electrical-field distribution and that of the me-\ntallic impurities leads to the formation of the glass columns.\nThe preliminary reflectance spectra normalized to the\nunetched sample are shown in Fig. 4. The relative reflectance\nis greater at infrared wavelengths from 800\u20131100 nm. At 15\u00b0\ncollection angle ~curves c and d!, the relative reflectance is\nminimum around 550\u2013560 nm while it is maximum around\n990\u20131000 nm. However, the intensity is dependent on the\nsize of the rods. In turn, at 45\u00b0 ~curves a, b!, the maxima are\nfurther apart, with the minimum relative reflectance occur-\nring at ;430 nm and ;540 nm for 4 and 20 mm rods, re-\nspectively, while the maximum is ;1100 nm. The shift ob-\nserved in the position of the peaks is indicative of the angular\ndependence. The spectra in Fig. 4 clearly show that the op-\ntical properties of the etched structures are dependent both\non the angle of collection and the geometry of the rods\npresent on the surface, as demonstrated previously6 for me-\ntallic diffraction gratings. The preliminary data above sug-\ngest that the rods could potentially be used as wavelength\nselection devices, providing the process is optimized to more\naccurately control the geometry, e.g., shape, size, and posi-\ntion of the rods at the surface of the substrates.\nWe have demonstrated a simple method of fabricating\nhigh aspect ratio glass rods on fused quartz, without using\nphotolithography. It consists of carefully controlling the\nplasma parameters to fabricate high-density and high aspect\nratio ~better than 100:1! glass rods, which exhibit regular\nconical or cylindrical geometry. The differential etching\nleading to the formation of glass columns is attributed to the\npresence of localized metallic impurities in the quartz matrix\nand the nonuniform distribution of the electrostatic fields at\nthe rounded edges of the contact mask. The preliminary op-\ntical data shows a significant absorption at visible wave-\nlengths whereas the relative transmission and reflectance are\ndominant in the infrared, suggesting that these glass columns\ncould be useful for many optical applications.\nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of the\nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the\ncollaborative partners at the University of Kent and the De-\npartment of Chemistry at the University of Surrey.
