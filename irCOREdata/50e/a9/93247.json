Their cosmopolitan attitudes and behaviours arise from \nboth survival strategies and from a taste for cultural goods, thus challenging the \nelite\/working-class divide in current cosmopolitanism literature. Through semi-structured \ninterviews and participant photographs of 24 East-European construction workers who have \narrived in London since the European Union expansion in May 2004, this paper illustrates \nhow these \u201enew\u201f European citizens, develop varying degrees and multitudes of \ncosmopolitanisms in everyday places such as building sites and shared houses. These \ncosmopolitanisms are shaped by their transnational histories, nationalistic sentiments, and \naccess to social and cultural capital in specific localised contexts. Thus subjective perceptions \nof gendered, ethnic, and racial notions of \u201eothers\u201f that are carried across national boundaries \nare reinforced or challenged as their encounters with \u201eothers\u201f produce perceptions of \nmarginalisation or empowerment in these places. This paper finally suggests that \ncosmopolitanism should be understood not simply through class but rather through access to \npower and capital in everyday localised contexts.  \n \nINTRODUCTION \nCosmopolitanism, in its most fundamental sense implies openness to difference. As \nthe process of enlargement of social, cultural, and personal agendas, and as infinite ways of \nbecoming open to \u201eothers\u201f (Pollock et. al, 2000), cosmopolitanism has recently made a \ncomeback in studies on globalisation and cultural politics. Traditionally, cosmopolitans have \nbeen conceptualised as elites (Beck, 2002; Hannerz, 2007) who \u201epursue refined consumption, \nand are open to all forms of otherness\u201f (Hiebert, 2002, p212), but various scholars now \nsuggest that global elites ironically have limited engagement with the \u201eother\u201f, and a \u201erather \n 2 \nrestricted corridor of physical movement\u201f (Vertovec and Cohen, 2002, p7; also Calhoun, \n2002) between global cities. A recent surge of scholarly work on migration focussing on \nmigrants\u201f transnational spatial practices (Kelly and Lusis, 2006; Wilding, 2007), social and \npolitical identities (Ehrkamp, 2006; Mohan, 2006; Vertovec, 2001), and relationships with \nthe State (Koser, 2007; Leitner and Ehrkamp, 2006; Morris, 1997; Zierhofer, 2007), suggest \nthat working-class migrants while maintaining \u201eintense linkages and exchanges with sending \nand receiving contexts\u201f (Vertovec, 2001, p575) also perform varieties of cosmopolitan \nbehaviours. Scholars now suggest that these \u201eworking-class cosmopolitans\u201f (Werbner, 1999) \nare open to difference neither as an ethico-political project, nor as conscious choice, but as a \npractical orientation towards \u201egetting by\u201f - one that requires a strategic engagement with \nothers through coerced choices in order to survive in new environments.  \nThe division between elite and working-class cosmopolitanisms is under scrutiny in \nthis paper through narratives and experiences of East-European\n1\n construction workers in \nLondon. As newly arrived migrants in the UK after the European Union expansion in May \n2004\n2\n, these post-socialist actors now have legal access to labour markets previously \ninaccessible from socialist national boundaries. In London they encounter \u201eothers\u201f in their \neveryday experiences of living and working in the city- encounters that make them not just \nconscious of difference but also reflect upon their subjective positions on gender and race \ncarried across national boundaries. Despite being of \u201eworking-class\u201f their cosmopolitan \nbehaviours and attitudes illustrate an ambiguity between the cultural consumption of \u201eothers\u201f \nand coerced choices for survival. Through the study of East European migrants in this paper, \n                                                 \n1\n In examining cosmopolitan experiences of all these nationalities under one category is not to homogenise them \nbut to suggest that the new wave of migrants have distinctly specific geographical and socio-political \ncontexts. \n2 \nThe EU expansion in 2004 includes eight States are Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, \nPoland, Slovakia, and Slovenia, whose nationals were given unlimited rights to live and work in the UK. Two \nothers Romania and Bulgaria joined in January 2007 but with reduced rights. \n 3 \nI examine the limits and possibilities of maintaining cosmopolitan thought through class \ndistinctions.   \n\u2018Working-Class\u2019 Cosmopolitanisms? \nThe traditional elite bias in cosmopolitan conceptualisation was challenged by \nWerbner\u201fs (1999) work on South Asian \u201eworking class cosmopolitans\u201f who gained \nknowledge and familiarity with other cultures through \u201especific kinds of focused networks\u201f \n(p20). Other scholars (Malcomson, 1998) have provided evidence of actually-existing \ncosmopolitan attitudes among working-class migrants that \u201einvolve(s) individuals with \nlimited choices deciding to enter into something larger than their immediate cultures\u201f. Their \nattitudes towards \u201eothers\u201f are shaped by the triviality of conducting everyday practices of \nliving and working, by \u201ebuilding bridges of cooperation across difference\u201f (Sandercock, \n1998). As Cohen (2004) suggests \u201esuch non-elite cosmopolites need to know how to provide \nservices \u2026 need to develop foreign language skills, [and] knowledge of migration policies\u201f \n(p145), which often means a \u201emundane cultural interaction\u201f (p148) with other transnational \nactors. This has been referred to as \u201eordinary cosmopolitanism\u201f (Vertovec and Cohen, 2002; \nLamont and Aksartova, 2002) - a condition where subjects engage with cultural difference \nstrategically, as a way of making necessary adjustments in particular places.  \nAs Appiah (2006) cautions however, cosmopolitans are not those who are simply \nengaged with other cultures and practices without approving, let alone adopting them. While \nWerbner\u201fs (1999) working-class cosmopolitans were able to negotiate through difference in \ndifferent parts of the world by connecting to transnational networks, it was not clear how or \nwhether their actually-existing cosmopolitanisms adopted any aspect of other cultures beyond \nthat required for survival. Moreover, the increasing focus on survival strategies as coerced \ninteraction with \u201eothers\u201f precludes other forms of cosmopolitanism related to consumption or \naestheticisation that might exist among working-classes. Indeed, there seems to be a sharp \n 4 \ndistinction in current literature between the \u201erefined taste\u201f of elite cosmopolitans and the \n\u201esurvival strategies\u201f of working-class cosmopolitans. The question remains- are working-\nclasses able to perform other cosmopolitanisms that are produced not just from a need to \nsurvive in an alien environment, but also from a desire to engage with \u201eothers\u201f beyond \nsurvival?  Indeed, is it really adequate to talk about cosmopolitanisms as primarily class-\nbased? \nThese questions are particularly relevant to East European construction workers in \nLondon. They are unlike Calhoun\u201fs (2002) \u201efrequent travellers\u201f with privileged access to \nsocial and cultural capital, and unlike refugees whose are bereft of the privileges of national \nbelonging. As legal citizens of a \u201enew\u201f Europe with full rights to live and work in the UK, \nEast-European construction workers challenge the elite\/working-class divide in current \nconceptualising on cosmopolitanism. Unlike elite cosmopolitans, East European migrants \nremain firmly embedded within their national spaces, carrying with them a \u201eready residue\u201f of \nsentiments about race and ethnicity - a common feature of nationalism in socialist discourse \n(Garapich, 2005). At the same time, their marginalisation and representation of the working-\nclass as \u201epassive and defenceless\u201f (Stenning, 2005) under post-socialism, have shaped a \nconsumerist and social mobility attitude among them in their host countries (Garapich, 2005). \nIn London however, their lack of cultural capital in English language or building skills puts \nthem at a distinct disadvantage in the labour market (Jordan, 2002). These complex \ncircumstances where they are marginalised because of their subjective positions within class \nand nationality and lack of access to cultural capital, but empowered through their legal status \nas \u201enew\u201f Europeans, shape their attitudes and behaviours towards \u201eothers\u201f. In attempting to \nempower themselves and becoming socially mobile, interactions between East European \nmigrants and \u201eothers\u201f in London are shaped by associations with those perceived in positions \nof power within the hierarchies of race and ethnicity (Eade et. al, 2006) as well as social and \n 5 \ncultural capital. These interactions produce particular \u201etrajectories, projects, and scenarios\u201f \n(Grillo, 2000, p201) of East-European cosmopolitan attitudes and behaviours. \nThus, while literature on cosmopolitanism has privileged a class-based North-South \nexchange focussing on elites, refugees, and expatriates (Beck 2002; Werbner, 1999; Mohan, \n2006; Cohen, 2004; Hannerz, 2007), the multitudes of attitudes and behaviours towards \n\u201eothers\u201f produced during East-West intra-European exchange, exhibited by the \u201enew\u201f citizens \nof Europe have largely been overlooked. As East-European construction workers develop \n\u201epractical-evaluative knowledge about the political and economic conditions in the \ndestination countries\u201f (Morawska, 2001, p58), they encounter those who are racially different \nfrom them, in ways that often produce internal conflicts and contradictions. Their \ncosmopolitanism should then be examined on the basis of whether they can exhibit openness \nand engagement with \u201eothers\u201f despite these conflicts (Kurasawa, 2004). This has been alluded \nto in two recent reports on East European (Spencer et. al., 2007) and Polish (Eade et. al., \n2006) migrants in the UK, which have both indicated that while high levels of exposure to \nethnic minorities occur in London, East-Europeans maintain ambiguous relationships with \nthem. This might be an \u201euneasy mix of parochial attachments and cosmopolitan ideals\u201f \nexisting alongside varying degrees of cultural insularity, as they \u201eengage in different \ncombinations of cultural maintenance and assimilation of the mainstream and other cultures\u201f \n(Entrikin, 1999, p280). In this paper, I suggest that this is shaped by their subjective location \nwithin power hierarchies, their nationalistic sentiments, as well as the social or cultural \ncapital that they are able to mobilise under the specific circumstances of the interaction in \nhighly localised everyday contexts.  \nSituating Everyday Cosmopolitanisms \nCosmopolitanism can be a \u201edifficult, uneasy, and radically incomplete effort\u201f (Fine \nand Boon, 2007, p6), a continuous struggle to negotiate the boundaries between self and \n 6 \notherness through a set of beliefs and practices forged in particular localities. Yet, \ncosmopolitans have often been conceptualised as citizens of the world, stubbornly refusing to \nbe \u201esituated\u201f. There is sufficient literature (Anderson, 2004; Binnie and Skeggs, 2004; \nEntrikin, 1999; Harvey, 2000) in geography however, that indicate a \u201espatial turn\u201f in \ncosmopolitan thinking. As Szerszynski and Urry (2002) note, cosmopolitanism \u201ehas to be \nfilled with specific and often rather different content in differently situated cultural worlds\u201f \n(p469). This is particularly evident among migrants who make use of the \u201einterstices of \nplaces\u201f (Hiebert 2002, p212), through their everyday practices, where the location of these \npractices in particular places produces multiple and divergent forms of \u201eglocalised \ncosmopolitanisms\u201f (Roudometof, 2005; Robertson, 1995). As Cheah and Robbins (1998) \nsuggest, cosmopolitanisms are located within a domain of contested politics- or \n\u201ecosmopolitics\u201f that are produced on a series of scales within and beyond the nation.  \nLocating cosmopolitanism within geographical scales has occurred at regional, \nnational, or urban levels. Harvey\u201fs (2000) notion of \u201egeographic specificity\u201f proposes to \nexamine the processes that shape and produce cosmopolitan visions of the State. Entrikin \n(1999) suggests that as nationalism becomes outmoded and undesirable both in academia and \ncultural politics, a \u201ecosmopolitan place\u201f can be realised from a collective identity and \ndemocratic political community in European Union. On the other hand, there has been \nincreasing discussions of the ways that cities have been conceived and marketed as \ncosmopolitan spaces that attempt to exclude particular forms of \u201eotherness\u201f (Binnie and \nSkeggs, 2004; Young et. al., 2006). While the urban or regional scales are valid sites for \nexamining cosmopolitanism, the actually-existing and everyday cosmopolitanisms of East \nEuropean migrants in London suggest that national space still remain valid for the \ncosmopolitan project, but also significant is the specificity of their everyday spheres of \nexperience- an issue that has not been fully examined in current literature.  \n 7 \nThe ways in which cosmopolitanism is shaped in everyday places, was partly \naddressed by Anderson\u201fs (2004) \u201efolk ethnography\u201f in Reading Market in Philadelphia. \nAnderson\u201fs cosmopolitans however, were open to diversity in ways that allowed them to \ninteract often positively with \u201eothers\u201f- perhaps because of his focus on \u201eneutral territories\u201f of \nthe marketplace rather than more personal places. Attitudes towards other cultures are not \nalways one of \u201eappreciation\u201f; indeed often contradictory versions prevail (Hiebert, 2002), \nwhich suggest that cosmopolitan attitudes are always imbued with \u201epartiality and \nvulnerability\u201f (Ley, 2004, p162) that are also shaped by the nature of physical proximity and \ninteractions. Thus as places become more private and intimate, different kinds of \nsubjectivities, and social and cultural capital are mobilised while interacting with others- a \nphenomenon that has significant impact on cosmopolitan attitudes and behaviours. \nExamining how such attitudes and behaviours among East-European construction workers \nare shaped by interactions in particular places will help in understanding the social and \ncultural geography of cosmopolitanism as well as its limitations and possibilities. \nIn this paper, I extend the multitudes of literature on cosmopolitanism as class-based, \nto an understanding of cosmopolitanism as situated. This allows us to explore \ncosmopolitanism as connected to a notion of \u201ehabitus\u201f (Bourdieu, 2002), where everyday \npractices in places such as the home or workplace, give value and meanings to different \nforms of (social or cultural) capital, subjective positions, and access to power. The habitus \ncan be understood as working through different social and spatial boundaries, making it both \npart of subjectivities and physical locations (Kelly and Lusis, 2006). These subjective \nlocations become critical to the shaping of practices and hence attitudes towards and \ninteractions with others in everyday places. Rethinking cosmopolitanism through a notion of \nhabitus thus makes it possible to reconceptualise cosmopolitanism as spatial- where forms \n 8 \nand degrees of openness to others are shaped by localised spatial contexts where encounters \nwith \u201eothers\u201f take place. \nIn this paper, cosmopolitanism is scrutinised in the broad sense of openness towards \nother people, cultures, and ways of life in particular localities. The various conceptions of \ncosmopolitanism discussed above are used as tools that will lead the interpretation of the \nnarratives and spatial contexts of East European migrants. In doing so, I interrogate \ncosmopolitanism as a spatial concept. I question the limits of class-based binaries of \nelite\/working-class cosmopolitanisms, and suggest instead that varieties of cosmopolitanisms \nare produced in a variety of localised contexts, each of which provide different access to \npower and capital, and produce different attitudes and behaviours towards others.  \n \nRESEARCHING EVERYDAY COSMOPOLITANISMS \nThe methodology consisted of a qualitative inquiry and analysis. Participants were \nrecruited for a two stage interview during October 2006-May 2007. In the first instance, a \nsemi-structured interview was conducted where participants were asked to discuss their \nexperiences of migration and of living and working in London. At the end of this interview, \nthey were provided with a disposable camera. They were instructed to take pictures of places \nwhich they would like to discuss or show as part of their life in London. The questions in the \nsecond interview were initiated through their pictures, which provided non-textual narratives \nof participants\u201f experiences. This approach to a \u201eparticipatory\u201f visual methodology provided \na means to discuss participants\u201f spaces in their own terms. This also meant that we could \ninclude into the conversation, places that had not been part of the first interview.  \nIn total, 24 participants (one Bulgarian, two Romanians, one Ukrainian, one Latvian, \nand the rest Polish) were interviewed. Most of them had arrived in London by coach across \nEurope and very few had arrived by air. Many participants had arrived before May 2004 as \ntourists or students and had stayed on illegally. The inclusion of their countries within the \n 9 \nEuropean Union in May 2004 had legally empowered them, although the Romanian and \nBulgarian participants remained illegal. The interviews were conducted in English and \nPolish. For some of the Polish participants who opted for a Polish interview, I made use of an \nonsite translator and the interviews were later translated and transcribed to English. The use \nof a Polish translator meant that the participants could express themselves comfortably in \ntheir own language although speaking in English was understood by them as a sign of their \nsocial mobility. This became clear when one participant was offended when I requested him \nto speak in Polish because of his poor English. While my presence as an Asian researcher \ngenerated curiosity and sometimes embarrassment among participants while recounting racist \nencounters, the presence of a Polish translator generated parallel interviews- when \nparticipants interviewed the translator on her migrant status. The transcriptions in English \nwere done by the same translator. This helped produce transcripts which better reflected the \ndynamics of the interview situation through detailed subtexts about the cultural or linguistic \nmeanings of certain words used in the conversation. The translator was also asked to produce \nreports about her perceptions of her relationship with each participant, which helped to \nunderstand the dynamics of the interview and interpret the conversations in this context. \nIn the following sections, I discuss the economic and political contexts in which there \nhas been a large inflow of East European migrants entering low-skilled work in the \nconstruction sector in London and living in shared houses in the rental market. In the second \npart, I use personal accounts of some of these construction workers to suggest how openness \nto \u201eothers\u201f in the everyday places of building sites and houses are shaped by different forms \nof interaction, physical proximity, and subjective positions of power. In the conclusions, I \nreflect on the importance of examining localised contexts in understanding \ncosmopolitanisms. \n 10 \nEAST EUROPEAN CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN LONDON \nLondon is of particular importance in understanding everyday cosmopolitanisms \namongst East European migrants. The impact of an increasingly flexible global labour market \nin London in recent years has seen a rise in migrants from across the world working here in \ndifferent sectors. This has made London one of the most diverse cities in United Kingdom. In \nthe 2001 Census, London showed evidence of its intense history of migration from all parts \nof the world with ethnic minority groups making up 29% of its population (CRE, 2007). This \nfigure increased to 40% when White ethnic minorities, such as Turks and the Irish were taken \ninto account.  \nWhile migration to the UK and especially London during the 20\nth\n century has been \ndominated by those from the Commonwealth, there is also a history of migration from East-\nEuropean countries since the Second World War (McDowell, 2005; Sword, 1996). The most \nsignificant impact on the migration from Eastern Europe into the UK however, has been the \nrecent accession of eight East-European States (called A8 states) to the European Union (EU) \nin May 2004, where nationals from these countries were given full rights to live in and enter \ninto any form of employment in the UK. In comparison to the A8 nationals, Bulgarian and \nRomanian citizens, whose countries joined the EU in January 2007 were given limited rights \nto work only in seasonal agricultural labour and in the food processing industry. This means \nthat those who work in the building trades continue to do so illegally.  \nIn February 2004, the UK government introduced the Worker\u201fs Registration Scheme \n(WRS) which required all A8 nationals entering to work in the UK to register with the Home \nOffice. From May 2004 to March 2007, 630,000\n3\n individuals have registered with the WRS \n(Home Office, 2007). Nearly two thirds (65%) of those registered are from Poland, followed \n                                                 \n3\n DEFRA (2005) found that the number of eligible workers who had not enrolled was close to 15%. As a result, \nthe WRS records underestimate the numbers of A8 nationals.  \n 11 \nby Lithuania 10% and Slovakia 10%. These workers are male (58%), young (82% between \n18-34 years) and without dependents (93%) in the UK (Home Office, 2007). London now has \nthe second largest concentration (15%) of WRS registered workers in the UK (Home Office, \n2007).  \nThere are particular features of the London construction sector (HSE, 2005) that has \nmade it particularly attractive as an entry-door for newly arrived low-skilled A8 nationals. \nFirstly, the construction industry is currently experiencing a \u201eboom\u201f as a major driver of the \nUK economy, with London contributing an output of \u00a38 billion (5% of the UK economy) \neach year (HPSC, 2005). Approximately 230,000 people (roughly 5% of London's \nworkforce) work in the construction sector, and construction workers are now paid above the \nnational average. These workers are predominantly male (90%), only 13% of workers are \nfrom black or minority ethnic groups, and only 20% are non-UK born (HPSC, 2005).  \nSecondly, the construction sector often employs informal working practices- paying \nworkers cash-in-hand and not recording them in the accounts. Finally, there are very low \nlevels of training and accreditation required for entry into the construction sector. Combined \nwith the fact that at the moment, the construction sector is also facing a huge skills shortage\n4\n \n(CIOB, 2006), it is easier for East European migrants to find low-skilled (and often low paid) \nwork within the construction sector, with little or no construction or language skills, and \ncompletely invisible to the authorities. Figure 1, shows the increasing numbers of East-\nEuropean, particularly Polish migrants entering the industry in the past five years.  \n \nFigure 1: Composition of non-UK construction workers (Compiled by author from \nLabour Force Survey, 2006) \n                                                 \n4\n It is expected that London will need 12,880 new workers a year, including 1,670 for wood trades and interior \nfit-outs and 1,390 for electrical trades and installation (CSN, 2006). \n 12 \nTheir employment in the construction sector however, has a direct impact on their \nhousing location.  The distribution of building sites across the city and the temporal nature of \nbuilding work means that their decision to live in particular areas of London is influenced by \nthe location of their workplaces. Spencer et. al. (2007) note in their study that 30% of their \nEast European respondents cite employment as a reason for moving accommodation. \nParticipants in this research too are highly mobile in their housing context- they have made \nbetween one and seven house moves since 2004. They often choose to sub-let rooms in \napartments or houses in order to reduce their rents- a trade-off that is acceptable in the \ncontext of their mobility (Spencer et. al., 2007). Thus shared houses, often with complete \nstrangers take on a new meaning in their lives. Sharing a flat or a house with others provides \nan affordable way to live in the city- close to work, public transport, and other amenities. It is \nalso in these places that they are often \u201eforced\u201f to interact with those different from them.  \nCOSMOPOLITANISM IN A GLOBAL CITY \nRecently, the connections between cosmopolitanism and transnational mobility have \nbeen under increased scrutiny. Participants in this study embody a range of mobility patterns, \ntheir movement through, and relationship with these places shaped by wider social, cultural, \nand political contexts. Many had lived in or travelled to other countries before arriving to the \nUK- United States, Australia, France, Sweden, Germany, and so on- as tourists, construction \nworkers, or as low-skilled workers. While none identify themselves explicitly as \ncosmopolitans, those participants who had travelled globally illustrate a variety of attitudes \ntowards others that incorporate elements of \u201eopenness and conviviality\u201f (Appiah, 2006). \nThese participants are similar to those who are labelled as \u201esearchers\u201f (Eade et. al., 2006, \np11) - who are intentionally unpredictable in their future plans and like Calhoun\u201fs (2002) \ncosmopolitans, argue for their place as one open to the world.  \n 13 \nThis is evident in the case of Krystian, a 47 year old Polish handyman. Krystian had \nworked as an army officer in Krakow and had never thought that communism would collapse \nor that he would ever leave the \u201esocialist camp\u201f. After the collapse of socialism however, \nKrystian left Krakow, and has been on the move since then.  \nNow, when I look at my life, I am a traveller. And, when I count it all now, before it \nused to be approximately five - seven years, now it has become like the border of \nthree years, two years, I need to change the place. \u2026 but, I do not know, for now, it is \ndifficult for me to, as I said, I am on like a- crossroads. I do not know, I do not know \nyet which, which road I will choose- this, or the other, I have so many. (Krystian, \nTranslated from Polish) \nKrystian\u201fs desire to identify himself as a traveller shows a certain \u201erootless \ncosmopolitanism\u201f (Hannerz, 2006) that despite connections to different places refuses to tie \noneself to a specific place. His journeys across the world however, were shaped by his \n\u201eparochial\u201f networks. Krystian moved to the United States when he found a job as a breakfast \nchef through his aunt who lived in New Jersey. His plan had been to bring his wife over but \nas she refused to join him, he returned to Krakow after three years. On return, their marriage \nbroke down, and Krystian left Krakow again to come to London where his nephew lived. \nKrystian\u201fs mobility is thus a process of negotiation, a process of improving his circumstances \nthrough transnational familial connections existing beyond national spaces.  \nDespite his \u201erootless\u201f identity, Krystian observes how people live in other places- an \nexperience that has changed him profoundly. His travels were been intended to become a \n\u201ecitizen of the world\u201f but to negotiate and access global labour markets and capital, often \nunder very difficult circumstances. This nevertheless, has made him deeply aware of and \ncritique nationalistic sentiments within Poland that has shaped the cosmopolitan trajectories \nof thousands of Poles who grew up during socialism and arrived in England recently. His \n 14 \ncosmopolitanism is shaped not by claims to universalism through \u201eindependent means, \nexpensive tastes, or a globe-trotting lifestyle\u201f (Robbins, 1998), but by an inward reflexivity of \nhis national history, and hence of his own identity- one which is deeply rooted and at the \nsame time inherently global. \nMaybe it [racism] also stemmed from the fact that before that we had not gone \nanywhere, but we were locked the whole time. Yes, in the eighties, I went to Hungary, \nor to Bulgaria, or to Romania, or to Berlin, I went, I saw. But these were short trips, \nand I perceived it differently. Because, because what there was, that we were fed this \npropaganda- in television, books- they were all lies. And that is why now, looking at- \ndo not translate that- but when you look at all the people that come here and cry out \n\u201ePoland for Poles\u201f or this or that. That is the way we are, because we were brought up \nlike that for so many years, we were taught that. We were not taught tolerance \ntowards other nations, all of that. It now comes out as our penance, and it is still inside \nus. (Krystian, Translated from Polish)  \nKrystian\u201fs encounters with diversity in London deeply challenged his beliefs and \nvalue systems brought across from a national space, where very different attitudes towards \n\u201eothers\u201f have been shaped. Further, Krystian\u201fs request not to translate this part of the \nconversation also illustrates his embarrassment at recounting this aspect of Polish identity to \nan Asian researcher. He hastens to add that coming to London has made him see difference in \na \u201ecompletely different way\u201f- one that is a \u201enormal\u201f part of everyday life. Thus Krystian\u201fs \ncosmopolitanism is a universal respect for difference and for human beings. His obligation to \nothers stretches beyond spatial boundaries- one that is distanciated, yet at the same time \nsituated through reference to localised contexts.  \nDrawing upon national spaces while reflecting upon difference, is also common \namong younger and less-travelled participants. Jan, a 23 year-old labourer (training as a \n 15 \ndecorator) arrived in London with his father three weeks before the interview from Lublin, a \nsmall town in Poland. Like Krystian, Jan too found employment through his sister who \nalready lived and worked in the city. Unlike Krystian, Jan, who grew up in post-socialist \nPoland did not adopt a reflexive critique of the socialist state. Instead, he commented on the \nactually existing attitudes towards \u201eothers\u201f in contemporary Polish society, one where his \nChurch non-attendance had generated gossip for many days.  \nAnd the fact that so many nationalities live here, Chinese, Japanese, black, fair \nones\u2026It would not work in Poland though, because if the priest would see the \ncovered one- holy water and blessing for the way \n5\n; and here people live with one \nanother, they do not care if someone walks down the street, some black person or \nsomething. There is something different there, I do not know how they did that, so \nmany nationalities live together and function somehow. (Jan, translated from Polish) \nLike Featherstone\u201fs (1990) cosmopolitans, Jan reflected an \u201eaesthetic stance to \ndivergent cultural experiences\u201f (p9). Part of this was evident in his openness towards cultural \ngoods. \u201eI went to some Chinese restaurant -very tasty. I am trying a lot of new things [with \nemphasis], because in Poland, like especially in Lublin, there was not a wide choice\u201f Jan \nexplained. Thus when Jan talked about other cultures, other cuisines, and other people, he \nstressed that he was still \u201ediscovering\u201f new things, a \u201ecosmopolitan curiosity\u201f (Appiah, 2006) \nthat has been flagged as the realm of global elites (see Robbins\u201f, 1988 critique of Hannerz). \nThis curiosity extended to the way Jan observed \u201eother\u201f women. \nWell, obviously with the Polish ones, the differences are visible with different \nnationalities, rather than with English. But for example, the biggest differences are \nwith black ones, Japanese, you know, or Indian ones, \u2026 I really like Japanese girls\u201f \neyes, again Indian ones, the darker complexion and figure, they are really nice in \n                                                 \n5\n An expression in Polish when someone wants to get rid of a problem easily and quickly.  \n 16 \nterms of figure; and black ones the lips, also different breasts and bum, you know. \n(Jan, translated from Polish) \nAlthough Jan\u201fs attitude towards difference derives from an awareness of the bodies of \nracial and coloured \u201eother\u201f women; he adds that if he could speak English he would date \nthem. Personal alliances with Japanese or Indian women did not present contradictions for \nJan. The nature of his openness towards Indian and Japanese women shows that this is not \njust a curiosity but also a desire to engage very personally with \u201eothers\u201f- restricted only by a \nlack of cultural capital. He adds that he likes the \u201eforwardness\u201f of the English girls who \nattempt to speak to him in clubs which he visits with his Polish friends- a quality uncommon \namongst Polish girls back in his hometown because as he explained \u201ePoland is more of a \nbackwater in comparison to what I see here\u201f. Jan\u201fs openness towards possible alliances with \n\u201eother\u201f women can be understood as a form of cosmopolitanism that is limited by a lack of \naccess to cultural capital, but one that attempts to adopt difference in one\u201fs personal life.  \nThe experiences of Krystian and Jan illustrate how different forms of openness \ntowards \u201eothers\u201f are developed and operationalised under different spatial circumstances. \nWhile both participants have developed degrees of \u201ecosmopolitan\u201f attitudes towards others \nthrough their encounters with diversity and critiques of nationalistic sentiments, these \nattitudes can only be mobilised as \u201ecosmopolitan\u201f performances through specific forms of \ncultural capital- in this case English language. This becomes significant in the case of Jan \nwhose \u201ecosmopolitanism\u201f is limited to the consumption of cultural goods. Thus while their \ncosmopolitan attitudes develop from their transnational histories, subjective perceptions of \nnationality, race, ethnicity, and gender, the degree and nature of their cosmopolitan \nengagement are limited by their access to specific forms of cultural capital.  \n 17 \nThe Building Site and beyond \nThe building site was significant as a workplace where specific types of social and \ncultural capital acquired paramount importance. These in turn shaped specific forms of \ninteractions between participants, and their colleagues, supervisors, and clients. As mentioned \npreviously, building sites in the UK remain primarily white male spaces. Yet, participants \nencountered differences in their ethnic and national positions. Entry into building work for \nmost of the participants depended upon the mobilisation of social capital - relatives, friends, \nand acquaintances who recommended them to employers. In that sense, most participants \nremained embedded within \u201eparochial associations\u201f (Hiebert, 2002) a notion that has often \nbeen suggested as opposed to cosmopolitanism. In the lack of English language and most \noften any building skills, participants were recruited at the lowest unskilled labourer level. \nTheir supervisors and employers (who were usually small-time contractors or skilled \ntradesmen) were those had been in the industry for much longer and therefore were mostly \nEnglish. \nWorking in these building sites and any chance of progression in their professions \nmeant the acquisition of a specific set of cultural capital- English language and building \nskills, and another set of social capital- networks which their employers had access to. \nProgression in this profession also meant getting \u201enoticed\u201f by their employers. Once noticed \nand trusted with more responsibility, participants would then gain experience in and take on \npositions as foremen or supervisors, or specialise as decorators, bricklayers, carpenters, and \nelectricians. Participants therefore understood the need to acquire new forms of social and \ncultural capital in order to progress in this hierarchy of the building site as well as the wider \nconstruction industry. Their English colleagues and supervisors who embodied these qualities \ntherefore became important social networks to tap into.   \n 18 \nThe building site however, with all its health and safety regulations, hourly paid work, \nand intense work environment did not provide the environment for cultivating these \nnetworks. Being a highly controlled and hierarchical environment, workers were usually \nspatially and temporally segregated in the site according to the nature of their work. Thus it \ndid not provide the physical conditions of socialising. The desire to understand the \u201eEnglish \nway of life\u201f meant that after work, most participants accompanied their English colleagues \nand supervisors to the pub for drinks. These pubs became the extension of social interactions \nbegun at the building site where participants engaged in conversations with them, as Tomasz \nhighlighted.  \nI prefer English pubs and I prefer go to the pub with English people \u201ecause it\u201fs like \nlesson for me. I can learn English, sometime you can pick up one, two words, and it \nreally helps you. So I prefer to go with English people.  \nTomasz, a 33 year old Polish foreman worked for an English subcontractor, \nsupervising turnkey residential refurbishments in central London. He was also the only \nPolish-English translator on a site where a large number of other Polish labourers were \nemployed. Tomasz had risen to the level of foreman because he was able to translate his \nemployer\u201fs requirements to the Polish workmen accurately. He therefore recognised the \nimportance of English in shaping his power over other workers on the building site. \nSocialising with the English was both a way to associate oneself with those perceived as \nmore powerful, and also of staking claims to the power hierarchies on site. Tomasz\u201fs \n\u201eopenness\u201f towards \u201eEnglish ways\u201f therefore, was also a strategy towards ensuring his future \nin the building industry.  \n \nFigure 2: Tomasz\u201fs picture of his daughter\u201fs birthday party. \n 19 \nParticipants like Tomasz however, were conscious that these interactions were \nlimited. They were strategic and non-personal in ways that did not develop into \u201efriendships\u201f. \nThere could be no doubt in Tomasz\u201fs mind that inviting English colleagues to their houses or \nfriendships between their children were not possible. This became clear when on his \ndaughter\u201fs birthday he invited her friends from her school and the only friend who came was \nan Afro-Caribbean girl, who also happened to be her best-friend.  \nThis is my daughter.  She had a party and we invited like 10 of her friends from \nclassmates and nobody turned up \u2026 Just one friend of her \u2013 the best friend of her \nturned up and that was it, so we called the mum of her friend and we ask her to let her \nstay in our house for the night and they had fun, actually.  \nThus Tomasz\u201fs \u201eopenness\u201f is shaped not just through his own motivations for \nsurviving in a competitive labour market in London but also through the experiences of his \nfamily. This is particularly relevant in the case of many East-European men who arrive in \nLondon with their families, who encounter difference not just through their own but also \nthrough the experiences of their children. Although Tomasz prefers to interact with the \nEnglish for reasons discussed above, he realises that adopting their \u201eway of life\u201f can only \nhappen in certain places under specific conditions. His (and his family\u201fs) \u201eopenness\u201f \ntherefore had to extend towards other races when it came to more personal friendships- a case \nillustrated through his daughter\u201fs birthday party.  \nAs mentioned, most participants were engaged in residential refurbishment work, \ninvolving mainly small-scale work such as bathroom or kitchen fitting, painting, tiling and so \non. This meant that often specific rooms in the house- such as the kitchen or bathroom \nbecame building sites whereas other rooms would continue to be inhabited by the owners. \nThus participants would spend extended amounts of time in their clients\u201f houses, trying to \ncomplete the work on time and with minimal disturbance to their clients\u201f everyday lives. In \n 20 \nreturn, clients would often extend their hospitality to the builders. This is how Benedykt, a 38 \nyear old Polish kitchen fitter, was introduced to \u201eIndian culture\u201f. Benedykt came to London \nas a tourist in 2000 from Chelmza, a small city in northern Poland. When he arrived, he found \nemployment illegally as a labourer with a Ukrainian contractor. Within a year, his wife had \nan affair with his employer and divorced him. Over time, Benedykt trained himself as a \nkitchen fitter. He tasted Indian food for the first time when he was fitting a kitchen for an \nIndian family, who sometimes cooked for him during the job. As a married man, he had \nnever cooked but now, he developed a new hobby. As he explained, \u201eI\u201fm interest [sic], yeah \nculture. Actually, Indian- Indian culture, because I, I very like Indian food and Indian culture \n\u2026 I\u201fm reading many books about Indian culture\u201f.  \nBenedykt moved to Ilford in North London because there were many Indian \nrestaurants and grocery shops in that area. He now cooks different cuisines- Indian, Chinese, \nand Mexican, since the ingredients for these are readily available there. Benedykt\u201fs \ncosmopolitanism however, is an aestheticisation of taste- one that has often been argued as \nthe realm of the elites (Hiebert, 2002; Kurasawa, 2004; Robbins, 1988; Werbner, 1999) and \nlimited in its engagement. He is not forced to open up to Indian culture as a necessary \ncondition of survival, as has been suggested in the case of working-class cosmopolitans \n(Cohen, 2004; Werbner, 1999), but has adopted only some material aspects of Indian culture. \nThus while he takes an interest in some of the practices of \u201eIndian culture\u201f and makes them \nsignificant in his life, his interaction with Indian clients as a builder, has produced very \ndifferent attitudes towards \u201eIndian people\u201f. \nThis was not huge money, I did not make huge money, but the experience that I \ngained there, as a cook, you know\u2026 is OK for me, I have good memories from that. \nNo, no, I do not have good memories from the financial point of view\u2026 Because, \nninety percent of Indian people are not willing to pay. \n 21 \nIn May 2004, when Poland joined the EU, Benedykt realised he did not need to work \nillegally and remain vulnerable to non-paying clients. One day, he met an Iranian \nacquaintance in a building store he used to buy his supplies from, and found out that he was \nnow the owner of the store. They got talking and decided to work together doing turnkey \nrefurbishment projects. Since then, Benedykt and his Iranian colleague have increased the \nsize of their business- his colleague sourcing and supplying building materials as well as \nliaising with clients, and Benedykt fitting the products in clients\u201f houses. They now employ \nother young East-European men as tilers, painters, and labourers to work for them. Unlike \nTomasz, Benedykt and his Iranian business partner are also friends- regularly visiting each \nother in their houses, helping each other with personal problems, and never falling-out at \nwork.  \n \nFigure 3: Benedykts\u201fs picture of his \u201ebuilding site\u201f \nBenedykt\u201fs approach towards \u201eothers\u201f raises questions about the distinction currently \nmade between elite and working-class cosmopolitanism. His story suggests that it is possible \nfor working-classes to also develop approaches towards \u201eothers\u201f in ways that are detached \nand distanciated from any real engagement with the lives of \u201eothers\u201f. Benedykt\u201fs attitudes \ntowards Indians was shaped by his experiences as a kitchen fitter in an Indian home, but his \nopenness towards \u201eothers\u201f was clearly not limited because of this experience. In another place \nand at another time, his collaboration with an Iranian man and subsequent friendship with \nhim suggests that he was also open to engagement with \u201eothers\u201f developed under more \npositive and productive circumstances. Benedykt\u201fs attitudes and behaviours cannot always be \ndescribed as \u201ecosmopolitan\u201f; indeed they are ambivalent towards \u201eothers\u201f that simultaneously \ndisplay limited and engaged versions of cosmopolitanism. His \u201eopenness\u201f is \u201esocially and \ngeographically situated; hence both limited and empowered\u201f (Cheah and Robbins, 1998, p2). \n 22 \nSignificant however, is how this has led to more productive ways of interacting with others \nthrough business, which suggests that there are multitudes of cosmopolitanisms, each of \nwhich is shaped under localised spatial contexts, and not always under conditions of class \nbelonging.  \n\u2018Cosmopolitanism\u2019 in the Shared Kitchen  \nWhen they first arrived in London, participants would live with friends, relatives, or \nneighbours from their country of origin; but as they engaged in building work, they usually \nbecame increasingly mobile, renting their own accommodation, often sharing with complete \nstrangers. These would usually be terraced houses or flats with a living room, kitchen, \nbathroom, and two or more bedrooms. With pressures on affordability, participants would \nrent rooms in these houses with other nationalities, while sharing bedrooms with friends, \nfamily, or work colleagues from their countries. Thus participants might be sharing their \ndomestic space both with \u201eparochial networks\u201f as well as with more global \u201eothers\u201f. In the \ninitial stages of their life in London, participants also reported having rented rooms in council \nflats- a practice that is illegal. Their landlords were often described as \u201eGypsies\u201f or \n\u201ePakistanis\u201f who exercised tremendous control over them by charging money for receiving \nmail, for overnight guests, and even asking them to vacate the property during regular council \nchecks. Their awareness that in London, some minorities occupied specific positions of \npower under specific contexts often reinforced pre-existing notions of race, ethnicity, and \nskin colour brought across from national spaces.  \nThis was illustrated in the case of Constantin, a 45 year-old electrician from Romania. \nConstantin used to be a foreman on building sites in Romania, but since he arrived in London \nin 2000, he took exams and qualified as an electrician. As a Romanian working illegally in \nthe building industry, his documents however were under a false name. Thus he perceived \nhimself as extremely vulnerable, relying on a large support network of Romanian friends, \n 23 \ncolleagues, and church-goers in order to find accommodation, access employment, and other \nservices. Constantin recounted stories of how his Pakistani landlord in his last \naccommodation continuously asked for money to buy household items. In addition, he \nrecounted how the differences in their cooking and eating practices created tensions between \nthem.  \nFor the start, it was four people, three Romanian and South America. But when he \n[Pakistani] come, when he bring, one evening it was six in a room, six people. They \neat [on] ground like gypsy and \u2026 no, no problem, but starting with dirty, everywhere \ndirty, in the kitchen and bathroom, everywhere \u2026 It smells. Smells smoke. In the \nkitchen, they burn the onion or something smell only if you burn, and onion is very \ntoxic for health, you know. I told them. Unbelievable! I said, well I cannot stay, living \n[with] this and all the smoke from the kitchen. \nSince this experience, Constantin had moved out to live with other Romanian work \ncolleagues. He said this was because \u201eat that time I wasn\u201ft sure of my English and I thought \nthat Romanians we are the same. We cooking same, and not like last year\u201f. While his \ndecision to live with fellow Romanians can be understood as a move towards cultural \nmaintenance, this did not exclude possibilities of interaction at a distance with \u201eothers\u201f. Since \nhe stayed in the same neighbourhood, Constantin often encountered his ex-landlord on the \nstreets and always stopped to chat with him. His said his move had been prompted by the \nfriction of physical proximity, his health concerns, and the landlord-tenant power \nrelationship. However, his narrative suggests that this concern reinforced deeper convictions \nabout \u201egypsies\u201f and people of colour that were carried across national spaces.  \nConstantin was not a \u201ecosmopolitan\u201f as Appiah (2006) would see it. He did not take \nan interest in the practices or beliefs of others, nor did he approve of them. Although he \nspoke some English, he did not socialise with his employers as Tomasz did. His illegal \n 24 \nposition meant that he had limited choices in becoming open to others- remaining deeply \nembedded and hidden within his Romanian social networks. Constantin\u201fs openness to \n\u201eothers\u201f was thus limited, selective, and spatial- enacted more easily on the street than in the \nkitchen.  \n  \nFigure 4: Krystian\u201fs picture of his kitchen \nThe kitchen in the shared house, as the site of intense (and coerced) physical \nproximity between transnational migrants in London is the pre-condition and medium for \nshaping the nature of interaction and subsequently the nature of openness towards \u201eothers\u201f. \nThis is also illustrated in Krystian\u201fs case who shared a three bedroom flat with his Japanese \nhousemate and Spanish landlord. Since his divorce, Krystian now cooked Polish food \neveryday. Unlike, Constantin, Krystian\u201fs housemates did not cook much. The interest his \nfood generated among his housemates made him happy, often encouraging him to share his \nfood and subsequently socialising with them. \n [I am socialising] \u2026 just now, with the Japanese a little bit, we started together\u2026He \nused to come at a similar time so he peeped at my cooking, he did what I did, and \nlike\u2026I sort of made friends with him. He is always curious of everything, so I had to \nlet him taste what I cooked, he saw and, \u201eoh, let me taste\u201f [imitating the sound] \u201eOh, \numm, mmm\u201f. (Krystian, translated from Polish) \nKrystian had limited English language skills but this did not restrict him in developing \nhis openness to \u201eothers\u201f in a variety of ways that included sharing food. Food worked as a \nwider cultural lever (albeit limited in its possibilities) towards a more cosmopolitan \ninteraction with difference- one that led to more personal friendships in a shared personal \nspace. Thus, sharing his food mobilised for Krystian various material symbols of globalness \nwhich he was reflecting upon and experiencing since he came to London (as discussed earlier \n 25 \nin this paper). Krystian\u201fs cosmopolitanism was limited not because of a stubborn cultural \nmaintenance but because of the lack of cultural capital that would open up other more varied \npossibilities of engagement with \u201eothers\u201f. \nCONCLUDING THOUGHTS \nThis paper thus questions the limits of examining cosmopolitanisms through socio-\neconomic divides of class, and proposes instead that varieties of cosmopolitanisms are shaped \nby individual biographies, access to forms of capital, and the localised spatial contexts in \nwhich specific attitudes and behaviours towards others are practised. This paper illustrates \nthat working-class cosmopolitanism is not a homogenous attitude to \u201eothers\u201f developed only \nunder conditions of coerced interaction for survival. There are multiple versions of \ncosmopolitans that are exhibited by East European male construction workers that are \nconnected to specific spatial conditions. Not all of them start as cosmopolitans in London, \nand not all of them become one. Their cosmopolitanisms are produced from their \ntransnational histories, nationalistic notions of gender, race, and ethnicity, and subjective \npositions of power that are operationalised in and through the everyday places in a global \ncity. In different places, East European construction workers can be both distanciated and \nengaged with \u201eothers\u201f, both cultural and political in their attitudes and behaviours towards \n\u201eothers\u201f, and can be cosmopolitan, not only from the need to survive but also from an attitude \ntowards opening up and engaging with \u201eothers.  \nThis paper thus notes the significance of spatially located social and cultural capital in \nproducing varieties of everyday situated cosmopolitanisms. It suggests that different spatial \ncontexts require the mobilisation of different kinds of social and cultural capital that shape \nthe nature of interaction with \u201eothers\u201f. One might have a cosmopolitan attitude but enacting \nthis in a particular place might be impossible without a specific cultural capital. Thus it \nchallenges the current parochial\/cosmopolitan divide by illustrating that mobilisation of \n 26 \n\u201eparochial\u201f social networks to access employment and accommodation does not necessarily \nlimit \u201ecosmopolitanism\u201f.  \nDistinctions between the \u201ecultural refinement\u201f of elite cosmopolitans and the \u201esurvival \nstrategies\u201f of working-class cosmopolitans are ambiguous in the case of East-European \nconstruction workers. Particular forms of openness exist towards \u201eothers\u201f that incorporate \nboth elitist and working-class stances. While many engage with \u201eothers\u201f in order to negotiate \nthrough labour and housing markets in London, they also simultaneously engage in cultural \nconsumption in ways that reflect an aesthetic attitude towards \u201eothers\u201f. This suggests that for \nEast-European migrants, cosmopolitanism is neither a cultural project, nor just a survival \nstrategy but a complex mixture of cultural, ordinary, banal, coerced, and glocalised \ncosmopolitanisms that are enacted under different spatial circumstances of interaction, \nsubjective positioning, and physical proximity. \nExamining how a variety of cosmopolitanisms are shaped indicates that the nature of \nopenness towards \u201eothers\u201f is deeply embedded in and produced from everyday practices in \nlocalised contexts. As they negotiate their place in a \u201enew\u201f Europe, East-European \nconstruction workers\u201f interaction with \u201eothers\u201f and subsequent openness towards them, are \nshaped by their location within various structures of power existing in these contexts. In the \neveryday places such as building sites, pubs, and shared houses, difference is experienced, \nunderstood, and negotiated by them and their families; and in these places \u201eothers\u201f are \nassimilated into one\u201fs life in different ways. The often personal nature of their physical \nproximity with \u201eothers\u201f in these places allows East-European migrants to reflect upon their \nown transnational trajectories, their ethno-national histories, and what it means to be a \nminority in their home-countries and in the UK. These reflections reach across local, national, \nand global spaces to develop\/reject notions of cosmopolitanism. Thus, cosmopolitanism for \nEast-European construction workers develops through their respective national identities, \n 27 \nsubjective positions of power, and attitudes towards \u201eothers\u201f carried across national spaces, \nwhich are then reinforced\/challenged in the physical proximity of everyday places. \nUnderstanding the varieties of these situated cosmopolitanisms raises questions about \nwhether cosmopolitanism should continue to be seen as part of class-specific contexts. \nAcknowledgements \nI wish to thank Suntory Toyota International Centres for Economics and Related \nDisciplines at the London School of Economics for the New Researcher Award, without \nwhich this research could not have been possible.
