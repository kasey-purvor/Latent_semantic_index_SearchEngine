McCLINTOCK\nDepartment of Physics, University of Lancaster, Lancaster LAl 4YB, UK\nReceived 16 January 1984\nRevised manuscript received 14 March 1984\nWe present evidence suggesting that Ihas and Sanders' intermediate mobility exotic negative ions can nucleate quantised\nvortex rings in superfluid 4He when subjected to strong enough electric fields.\nServal years ago, Doake and Gribbon discovered\n[1] that there can exist in He II a fast ion which, un-\nlike the normal negative ion [2], may be accelerated\nto the Landau critical velocity vL for roton creation\nwithout undergoing metamorphosis to a charged vor-\ntex ring, even under the saturated vapour pressure.\nAlthough Doake and Gribbon were unable to ascertain\nthe physical conditions needed to generate this mys-\nterious entity reproducibly, Ihas and Sanders showed\n[3,4] soon afterwards that the vital factor apparently\nlay in the provision of an electrical discharge in the va-\npour above the surface of the liquid. The latter au-\nthors also discovered that the glow discharge source\nproduces not only the normal and fast negative ions,\nbut also (astonishingly) a large number of other types\nof negative ion with low-field mobilities lying inter-\nmediate between those of the fast and normal ions.\nThe existence of this unexpected plethora of exot-\nic negative charge carriers in He II constitutes an in-\ntriguing and still unsolved theoretical problem. Al-\nthough the structure of the normal negative ion is\nunderstood in considerable detail [2] the nature(s)\nof the fast and intermediate ions remain(s) an en-\ntirely open question. One reason for our continuing\nignorance is that the available experimental informa-\ntion [1,3,4] is rather sparse; and we have therefore\n-I< Work supported by the Science and Engineering Research\nCouncil (UK).\n1Now at IBM(UK), 11 Albion Street, Leeds, UK.\n0.375-9601\/84\/$ 03.00 \u00a9 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.\n(North-Holland Physics Publishing Division)\nFig. 1.

The relatively dark-shaded components are of metal, and the lighter shading\nrepresents insulator.\nand intermediate ions remain(s) an entirely open question. One reason for our continuing\nignorance is that the available experimental information [1,3,4] is rather sparse; and we\nhave therefore embarked on a research programme aimed at remedying this unsatisfactory\nsituation. In this Letter, we report the preliminary results of what is believed to be the\nfirst experimental study to be made of the behaviour of the intermediate mobility ions in\nstrong electric fields.\nOur ion cell is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. It is similar in general design to\nthat described by Ihas and Sanders except that, in order to achieve strong electric fields,\nwe have made provision for the application of up to 3 \u00d7 103 V across a drift space of\n10 mm. A glow discharge is struck between electrodes d and e, usually while keeping the\n2\nliquid surface level with the upper surface of e. Ions then travel through the liquid to the\nfirst gate grid f, where they are stopped by the retarding potential normally maintained\nbetween f and g. Application of a transient negative voltage pulse to e and f opens the\ngate momentarily, and allows a thin disk of ions to enter the drift space between g and h.\nFinally, the ions pass through the screening grid h and are detected as they approach the\ncollector j. To avoid electrical breakdown in the vapour outside the cell, all connections\nenter it from beneath. The level of the helium surface in the bath can be lowered by\nmeans of a fountain pump, which raises some of the He II via a needle valve to an upper\nreservoir; or it can be raised by switching off the fountain pump and opening the needle\nvalve, so as to allow some of the He II to return to the bath again.\nIn Fig. 2 we show some typical ion signals at 1.03 K in electric fields E that are\nstrong enough to have converted the normal ions to charged vortex rings. The large\nnormal ion\/vortex signal moves to the right with increasing E to reveal a number of small\nmaxima corresponding (presumably) to the intermediate ions. Although signal\/noise\nfrom our relatively short cell is (not surprisingly) rather poor, the drift velocity \u03c5\u00af the\nintermediate ions quite evidently decreases with increasing E. Behaviour of this type\nis, of course, highly reminiscent of that displayed by the charged vortex rings formed by\nnormal ions, and it may therefore be regarded as an indication that intermediate ions,\ntoo, can form vortex rings. We have also made measurements for values of E well below\nthat of the \u201cgiant fall\u201d in v which occurs at Ecn for the normal ion. In agreement with\nthe earlier work [3,4] we observe several quite distinct mobilities. As E is increased for\nE < Ecn we find that \u03c5\u00af(E) for the principal intermediate ions bends over and approaches\nthe horizontal. Further increase of E then causes each intermediate ion signal to vanish\nin turn, apparently because their \u03c5\u00af(E) characteristics undergo \u201cgiant falls\u201d, just as in the\ncase of the normal ion, though occurring at a series of critical electric fields Eci which\nlie at values of E considerably below Ecn. The corresponding critical drift velocities are\nfound to be up to 10m s\u22121 larger than for the normal ion. Unfortunately, it has not so far\nproved possible to associate individual species observed for E < Eci unambiguously with\nthose for E > Eci: this is because there is a range of E running from Eci to beyond Ecn\nwhere the (relatively enormous) normal ion\/vortex signal overlaps and entirely swamps\nthe much weaker intermediate ion signals.\n3\nembarked on a research programme aimed at remedy-\ning this unsatisfactory situation. In this letter, we re-\nport the preliminary results of what is believed to be the\nfirst experimental study to be made of the behaviour\nof the intermediate mobility ions in strong electric\nfields.\nOur ion cell is illustrated schematically in fig. 1. It\nis similar in general design to that described by Ihas\nand Sanders except that, in order to achieve strong\nelectric fields, we have made provision for the appli-\ncation of up to 3 X 103 V across a drift space of\n10 mm. A glow discharge is struck between electrodes\nd and e, usually while keeping the liquid surface level\nwith the upper surface of e. Ions then travel through\nthe liquid to the first gate grid f, where they are\nstopped by the retarding potential normally main-\ntained between f and g. Application of a transient\nnegative voltage pulse to e and f opens the gate mo-\nmentarily, and allows a thin disk of ions to enter the\ndrift space between g and h. Finally, the ions pass\nthrough the screening grid h and are detected as they\napproach the collector j. To avoid electrical break-\ndown in the vapour outside the cell, all connections\nenter it from beneath. The level of the helium surface\nin the bath can be lowered by means of a fountain\npump, which raises some of the He II via a needle val-\nve to an upper reservoir; or it can be raised by switch-\ning off the fountain pump and opening the needle\nvalve, so as to allow some of the He II to return to\nthe bath again.\nIn fig. 2 we show some typical ion signals at 1.03 K\nin electric fields E that are strong enough to have con-\nverted the normal ions to charged vortex rings. The\nlarge normal ion\/vortex signal moves to the right with\nincreasing E to reveal a number of small maxima cor-\nresponding (presumably) to the intermediate ions. Al-\nthough signal\/noise from our relatively short cell is\n(not surprisingly) rather poor, the drift velocity vof\nthe intermediate ions quite eVidently decreases with\nincreasing E. Behaviour of this type is, of course,\nhighly reminiscent of that displayed by the charged\nvortex rings formed by normal ions, and it may there-\nfore be regarded as an indication that intermediate\nions, too, can form vortex rings. We have also made\nmeasurements for values of E well below that of the\n\"giant fall\" in v which occurs at Ecn for the normal\nion. In agreement with the earlier work [3,4] we ob-\nserve several quite distinct mobilities. As E is increased\n?ig. 2.
