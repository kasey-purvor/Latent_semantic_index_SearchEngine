We say that a\nsubalgebra U of L is a supplement to M in L if L = M + U . In similar\nfashion to [1] we introduce the following conditions:\n\u2022 (MO) Every maximal subalgebra of L admits a supplement which is\none-dimensional; that is every maximal subalgebra of L has codimen-\nsion one in L.\n\u2022 (MA) Every maximal subalgebra of L admits an abelian supplement.\n\u2022 (MD) Every maximal subalgebra M of L admits a supplement whose\nderived algebra is inside M .\n\u2022 (MN) Every maximal subalgebra of L admits a nilpotent supplement.\n\u2022 (MU) Every maximal subalgebra of L admits a supplement every ele-\nment of which acts nilpotently on L.\nWe will denote by MO (respectively, MA,MD,MN , and MU) the\nclass of Lie algebras satisfying condition (MO) (respectively, (MA), (MD),\n(MN), and (MU)). Our objective is to study these classes of algebras. Cor-\nresponding classes of groups were studied by Baumeister ([1]), who showed,\nin particular, that any group inMA is solvable, and that a group belongs to\nMD if and only if it is solvable. Similar problems concerning factorisations\nof Lie algebras as sums of subalgebras of a certain type have been studied\nextensively (see, for example, [13], [14], [2], [10], [18], [20], [21], [22] and the\nreferences contained therein.)\nIn section two we collect together a few preliminary results. First the\ndescription of the algebras in MO as derived in [19] is given. Then some\nstraightforward inclusions between these classes of algebras are noted. Next\nit is shown that all solvable algebras belong toMD, that a completely solv-\nable algebra is inMU if and only if it is nilpotent, and that all supersolvable\nand all metabelian algebras are inMA. A relationship is given between de-\ncompositions of a nonassociative algebra and corresponding decompositions\nof the algebra over a finite field extension. The final result here asserts that\nif H is a saturated homomorph of Lie algebras, then so is MH.\nThe third section is concerned with the simple algebras in these classes.\nIt is shown that if the underlying field is algebraically closed of characteristic\nzero, then A1 is the only such algebra. We also identify when a maximal\nparabolic subalgebra has an abelian supplement.\n2\nThe last section contains the main classification results, describing ex-\nplicitly the algebras in each of the classes defined above.\nThroughout L will denote a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field F .\nIf A and B are subalgebras of L for which L = A+B and A\u2229B = 0 we will\nwrite L = A\u2295B. The ideals L(k) of the derived series are defined inductively\nby L(0) = L, L(k+1) = [L(k), L(k)] for k \u2265 0; we also write L2 for L(1). We\nsay that L is completely solvable if L2 is nilpotent; L is metabelian if L2 is\nabelian; and L is supersolvable if it has a series 0 = L0 \u2282 L1 \u2282 . . . \u2282 Ln = L\nof ideals of L with dimLi = i. If A is a subalgebra of L, the centralizer of\nA in L is CL(A) = {x \u2208 L : [x,A] = 0}.\n2 Preliminary results\nThe Frattini ideal of L, \u03c6(L), is the largest ideal of L contained in all\nmaximal subalgebras of L. The algebras in MO were classified in [19] as\nfollows.\nTheorem 2.1 ([19, Theorem 1]) Let L be Lie algebra over any field F .\nThen the following are equivalent:\n(i) L \u2208MO; and\n(ii) L\/\u03c6(L) = R \u2295 S where the radical R is supersolvable and \u03c6-free, and\neither S = 0 or S is three-dimensional simple with a basis {u\u22121, u0, u1}\nand multiplication [u\u22121, u0] = u\u22121, [u\u22121, u1] = u0, [u0, u1] = u1.\nThere are some easy relationships between the classes of algebras we\nhave introduced.\nLemma 2.2 (i) MO \u2286MA \u2286MN , MA \u2286MD and MU \u2286MN .\n(ii) If L is solvable, or F has at least dimL\u22121 elements, thenMD \u2286MN .\n(iii) If L is completely solvable then MN =MD.\nProof. (i) These inclusions are straightforward.\n(ii) Suppose that L \u2208 MD, and let M be any maximal subalgebra of L.\nThen there is a subalgebra B of L such that L = M + B and B2 \u2286 M .\nLet C be a Cartan subalgebra of B (which, under the stated assumptions,\nexists, by [4, Theorem 3 and Corollary 1.2]) and let B = C \u2295 B1 be the\n3\nFitting decomposition of B relative to adC. Clearly B1 \u2286 B2 \u2286M , whence\nL =M + C and L \u2208MN . We have established that MD \u2286MN .\n(iii) Let L be completely solvable and let M be a maximal subalgebra of\nL with a nilpotent supplement U . Then U2 = \u03c6(U), by [17, Section 5],\nand \u03c6(U) \u2286 \u03c6(L), by [16, Theorem 2], so U2 \u2286 \u03c6(L) \u2286 M . It follows that\nMN \u2286MD. The reverse inclusion comes from (ii) above. \u0003\nWe define the abelian socle of L, AsocL, to be the sum of the minimal\nabelian ideals of L. Next we consider the solvable algebras in these classes.\nProposition 2.3 Let L be a Lie algebra over an arbitrary field F .\n(i) If L is solvable then L \u2208MD.\n(ii) If L is completely solvable, then L \u2208MU if and only if L is nilpotent.\n(iii) If L is supersolvable then L \u2208MA.\n(iv) If L is metabelian (so, in particular, if L is completely solvable and\n\u03c6-free) then L \u2208MA.\nProof. (i) Let L be solvable and letM be a maximal subalgebra of L. Then\nthere is a k \u2265 0 such that L(k) 6\u2286M but L(k+1) \u2286M . Clearly L =M +L(k)\nand so L \u2208MD.\n(ii) Let L be completely solvable. Suppose that L \u2208MU , but that L is not\nnilpotent, and let M be a maximal subalgebra of L with N \u2286 M , where\nN is the nilradical of L. Then there is a nil subalgebra U of L such that\nL =M+U . But now N+U is nilpotent, and is an ideal of L, since L2 \u2286 N ,\nso U \u2286 N \u2286M , a contradiction. The converse is clear.\n(iii) If L is supersolvable then L\/\u03c6(L) is supersolvable, and so L \u2208MO, by\nTheorem 2.1. Moreover, MO \u2286MA, by Lemma 2.2(i).\n(iv) Let L be metabelian and suppose thatM is a maximal subalgebra of L.\nIf L2 \u2286M then M has codimension one in L and so has an abelian supple-\nment. If L2 6\u2286M , then L2 is an abelian supplement to M . That completely\nsolvable \u03c6-free algebras lie in this class follows from [17, Theorems 7.3 and\n7.4]. \u0003\nNot every completely solvable Lie algebra L belongs toMA, as the next\nexample shows.\nExample 2.1 Let L be the four-dimensional Lie algebra over the real field\nwith basis e1, e2, e3, e4 and products [e1, e2] = e2 \u2212 e3, [e1, e3] = e2 + e3,\n[e1, e4] = 2e4, [e2, e3] = e4, other products being zero.\n4\nThen L is completely solvable, but not \u03c6-free, as \u03c6(L) = Re4. Also, M =\nRe1 + Re4 is a maximal subalgebra of L that has no abelian supplement.\nWe have the following relationship between decompositions of a nonas-\nsociative algebra and corresponding decompositions of the algebra over a\nfinite field extension.\nLemma 2.4 Let A be a nonassociative algebra over a field F with subalge-\nbras A1 and A2, and let K be a finite field extension of F , whose degree is\nnot a multiple of the characteristic of F , and so that F is the fixed field of\nthe group Gal(K\/F ) of F -automorphisms of K. Then A = A1 + A2 if and\nonly if A\u00af = A\u00af1 + A\u00af2, where B\u00af = B \u2297F K for any subalgebra B of A.\nProof. Clearly A = A1 + A2 implies that A\u00af = A\u00af1 + A\u00af2. Conversely, let\nA\u00af = A\u00af1+ A\u00af2, and let x \u2208 A. Then x\u2297 1 = x\u00af1+ x\u00af2 where x\u00af1 \u2208 A\u00af1, x\u00af2 \u2208 A\u00af2.\nLet {k1, . . . , kn} be a basis for K over F , Gal(K\/F ) = {\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8n}. For\neach \u03b8 \u2208 Gal(K\/F ) let U\u03b8 be the semilinear transformation of A\u00af defined by\nU\u03b8(\n\u2211\nai \u2297 ki) =\n\u2211\nai \u2297 \u03b8(ki) as in [11, page 295]. Then U\u03b8i(x\u2297 1) = x\u2297 1,\nand so x\u2297 1 = U\u03b8i(x\u00af1) + U\u03b8i(x\u00af2) for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Hence\nx\u2297 1 = 1\nn\n(U\u03b81(x\u00af1) + . . .+ U\u03b8n(x\u00af1)) +\n1\nn\n(U\u03b81(x\u00af2) + . . .+ U\u03b8n(x\u00af2)).\nMoreover, 1n(U\u03b81(x\u00afi) + . . .+ U\u03b8n(x\u00afi)) is fixed by all of the elements of {U\u03b8 :\n\u03b8 \u2208 Gal(K\/F )}, and so belongs to Ai for each i = 1, 2, whence the result.\n\u0003\nNotice, however, that if L is as in Example 2.1 above then L \/\u2208 MA,\nwhereas, considered as an algebra over C, we have L \u2208MA.\nA class H of finite-dimensional Lie algebras is called a homomorph if it\ncontains, along with an algebra L, all epimorphic images of L; it is saturated\nif L\/\u03c6(L) \u2208 H implies that L \u2208 H. Then we have that if H is a saturated\nhomomorph, so isMH (whereMH is the class of Lie algebras all of whose\nmaximal subalgebras have a supplement U \u2208 H.) First we need a lemma.\nLemma 2.5 Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F and letM be a maximal\nsubalgebra of L with a supplement U . Then M has a supplement W with\n\u03c6(L) \u2229W \u2286 \u03c6(W ).\nProof. Choose W to be a subalgebra of U that is minimal with respect to\nU = \u03c6(L)\u2229U +W . Then L =M +U =M + \u03c6(L)\u2229U +W =M +W and\n\u03c6(L) \u2229W = (\u03c6(L) \u2229 U) \u2229W \u2286 \u03c6(W ), by [17, Lemma 7.1]. \u0003\n5\nProposition 2.6 Let H be a saturated homomorph of Lie algebras. Then\nL \u2208 MH if and only if L\/\u03c6(L) \u2208 MH; that is MH is also a saturated\nhomomorph.\nProof. Suppose first that L \u2208MH and letM\/\u03c6(L) be maximal subalgebra\nof L\/\u03c6(L). ThenM is a maximal subalgebra of L and so there is a subalgebra\nU \u2208 H such that L =M + U . But now\nL\n\u03c6(L)\n=\nM\n\u03c6(L)\n+\nU + \u03c6(L)\n\u03c6(L)\nand\nU + \u03c6(L)\n\u03c6(L)\n\u223c= U\nU \u2229 \u03c6(L) \u2208 H,\nwhence L\/\u03c6(L) \u2208MH.\nSo suppose now that L\/\u03c6(L) \u2208MH and letM be a maximal subalgebra\nof L. Then there is a subalgebra U\/\u03c6(L) \u2208 H such that L\/\u03c6(L) =M\/\u03c6(L)+\nU\/\u03c6(L), and so L = M + U . Thus there is a subalgebra W of U with\nU = \u03c6(L) + W , L = M + W and \u03c6(L) \u2229 W \u2286 \u03c6(W ), by Lemma 2.5.\nMoreover,\nW\n\u03c6(L) \u2229W\n\u223c= \u03c6(L) +W\n\u03c6(L)\n=\nU\n\u03c6(L)\n\u2208 H, so W\n\u03c6(W )\n\u223c= W\/(\u03c6(L) \u2229W )\n\u03c6(W )\/(\u03c6(L) \u2229W ) \u2208 H.\nIt follows that W \u2208 H and therefore L \u2208MH.\nIt is easy to see that MH is a homomorph. \u0003\n3 Simple algebras\nOur first objective in this section is to establish the following result.\nTheorem 3.1 The only simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field\nof characteristic zero belonging to MA, or to MU , is A1.\nFirst let us recall some facts about maximal subalgebras of simple Lie\nalgebras L over an algebraically closed fields F of characteristic zero. They\nfall into three types:\n(I) reducible maximal subalgebras, which are described in [9, Theorems\n1.1, 1.2, page 252];\n(II) irreducible non-simple maximal subalgebras, which are described in [9,\nTheorems 1.3, 1.4, page 253]; and\n6\n(III) irreducible simple maximal subalgebras, which are described in [9,\nTheorem 1.5, page 252].\nA subalgebra B of a semisimple Lie algebra L is called regular in L if we\ncan choose a basis for B in such a way that any vector of this basis is\neither a root vector of L corresponding to some Cartan subalgebra C of L,\nor otherwise belongs to C; B is an R-subalgebra of L if it is contained in a\nregular subalgebra of L, and is an S-subalgebra otherwise (see [8, page 158]).\nWe say that B is parabolic in L if it contains a Borel subalgebra of L; it is\nreductive in L if the representation x 7\u2192 adL x of B is semisimple.\nThen a further way of describing the maximal subalgebras of L is that\nthey are either\n(a) parabolic, all of which are regular and of type (I); or\n(b) reductive, which further subdivide into:\n(i) regular reductive subalgebras, which are of type (I), and are\nsemisimple of maximal rank; and\n(ii) S-subalgebras, which are semisimple and are mostly of type (II)\nor type (III) (entirely so in the case of An, Bn and Cn).\nProof of Theorem 3.1. For each class of simple Lie algebras L we shall\nshow that there is a maximal subalgebra M such that for any abelian\nsubalgebra A (respectively, nil subalgebra U) of maximal dimension in L,\ndim (M + A) < dimL (respectively, dim (M + U) < dimL). This is the\ncontent of the Table 1 below, whose entries we will explain next.\nFor each class of algebra we list in column 2 a possible choice of maximal\nsubalgebra M to meet our claim. In some cases two subalgebras are given:\nthe top one is sufficient to rule out the possibility of an abelian supplement,\nbut not of a nil supplement. Of course the lower one of the two would suffice\non its own, but the top one is a more straightforward example and so is listed\nfor interest.\nMany maximal subalgebras can be found from Dynkin\u2019s trick of removing\na node from the extended Dynkin diagram: this gives regular reductive\nsubalgebras. The top entry for the algebras of types B,C or D can be\nfound in this way (and remembering that B1 = A1 and D2 = A1\u2295A1); they\ncan also be found in [8, Table 12, page 150; page 232]. The lower entries\nfor Cn and B2 follow from the fact that all of the three-dimensional S-\nsubalgebras of Bn and Cn are maximal, except for A281 \u2282 G2 \u2282 B3 (whereas\n7\nsimple maximal dimL dimM rankL dimA\nalgebra subalgebra\nL M dimU\nA2 A1 8 3 2 2\n3\nA2n Bn 4n2 + 4n 2n2 + n 2n n2 + n\n(n \u2265 2) 2n2 + n\nA2n+1 Dn+1 4n2 + 8n+ 3 2n2 + 3n+ 1 2n+ 1 n2 + 2n+ 1\n(n \u2265 1) 2n2 + 3n+ 1\nB2 A1 \u2295A1 10 6 2 3\nA101 3 4\nB3 A1 \u2295A1 \u2295A1 21 9 3 5\n9\nB2n Bn \u2295Dn 8n2 + 2n 4n2 2n 2n2 \u2212 n+ 1\n(n \u2265 2) 4n2\nB2n+1 Bn \u2295Dn+1 8n2 + 10n+ 3 4n2 + 4n+ 1 2n+ 1 2n2 + n+ 1\n(n \u2265 2) 4n2 + 4n+ 1\nC2n Cn \u2295 Cn 8n2 + 2n 4n2 + 2n 2n 2n2 + n\n(n \u2265 2) A1 3 4n2\nC2n+1 Cn \u2295 Cn+1 8n2 + 10n+ 3 4n2 + 6n+ 3 2n+ 1 2n2 + 3n+ 1\n(n \u2265 1) A1 3 4n2 + 4n+ 1\nD2n Dn \u2295Dn 8n2 \u2212 2n 4n2 \u2212 2n 2n 2n2 \u2212 n\n(n \u2265 2) 4n2 \u2212 2n\nD2n+1 Dn \u2295Dn+1 8n2 + 6n+ 3 4n2 + 2n+ 1 2n+ 1 2n2 + n\n(n \u2265 2) 4n2 + 2n+ 1\nE6 A\n9\n2 78 8 6 16\n36\nE7 A\n231\n1 , A\n399\n1 133 3 7 27\n63\nE8 A\n520\n1 , A\n760\n1 , 248 3 8 36\nA12401 120\nF4 A\n156\n1 52 3 4 9\n24\nG2 A\n28\n1 14 3 2 3\n6\nTable 1: Maximal Subalgebras\n8\nall three-dimensional S-subalgebras of An and Dn are non-maximal except\nfor A41 \u2282 A2.) The superfixes indicate the index of the embedding as defined\nin [8].\nThe three-dimensional representation of A1 gives an embedding of A1\nin A2 under which it is a maximal S-subalgebra of that algebra. There are\nnatural embeddings of Bn in A2n(n \u2265 2) and Dn+1 in A2n+1(n \u2265 1) (also\nin [9, Table 5, page 366]) under which these are maximal S-subalgebras of\nthose algebras. Finally the maximal S-subalgebras listed for each of the\nexceptional simple Lie algebras are taken from [8, Table 39, page 233].\nIn the final column of the table the upper number, \u03b1 (respectively, lower\nnumber \u03b3), is the maximal possible dimension of an abelian (respectively,\nnil subalgebra). The values for \u03b1 were determined by Malcev in [12], or are\ngiven in [6, Table 1]. The value for \u03b3 is computed as 12(dimL\u2212 rankL) (see\n[7]).\nThe above result can be extended to cover MN as follows.\nCorollary 3.2 The only simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field\nof characteristic zero belonging to MN is A1.\nProof. Suppose that L 6\u223c= A1 and letM be a maximal subalgebra of L from\nTable 1 (the lower entry if two are given) and suppose that L = M + N\nwhere N is a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L. Then N = CL(N) and so\nN is algebraic. It follows that N = T \u2295U where T is a toral subalgebra and\nU is the nilradical of N . Since N is nilpotent we must have that [T,U ] = 0.\nNow it can be seen from Table 1 that N must have the same dimension\nas a Borel subalgebra of L. In fact, in view of [7], it must be equal to a\nBorel subalgebra B of L in which T is a Cartan subalgebra of L and U is\nthe nilradical of B. Since [T,U ] = 0 this is impossible. \u0003\nAll of the subalgebras in Table 1, of course, are reductive. The maximal\nparabolic subalgebras generally are too large to yield to dimension argu-\nments of the above kind. However, we can determine which of them have\nabelian supplements.\nLet L be a simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of charac-\nteristic zero, H a Cartan subalgebra of L and \u0393, \u0393+, \u03a3, respectively, the sys-\ntems of roots, positive roots and simple roots of L with respect to H. Then\nL = H +\u03a3\u03b1\u2208\u0393V\u03b1, where V\u03b1 is spanned by a unique element e\u03b1. Let \u03a31 \u2286 \u03a3\nbe a non-empty subsystem of \u03a3, and put \u22061 = {\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03b3 = \u03a3\u03b1\u2208\u03a3\\\u03a31m\u03b1\u03b1}\nand \u2206+2 = (\u0393 \\\u22061) \u2229 \u0393+.\n9\nThen every parabolic subalgebra of L is conjugate to a standard parabolic\nsubalgebra of the form P = H + \u03a3\u03b1\u2208\u22061V\u03b1 + \u03a3\u03b1\u2208\u2206+2 V\u03b1 = R \u2295 U , where\nR = H + \u03a3\u03b1\u2208\u22061V\u03b1 is its reductive summand and the ideal N = \u03a3\u03b1\u2208\u2206+2 V\u03b1\nis its nilradical. It is clear that every maximal parabolic subalgebra has\na nil supplement, namely the nilradical, No = \u03a3\u2212\u03b1\u2208\u2206+2 V\u03b1, of the opposite\nparabolic subalgebra of L. When they have an abelian supplement is given\nby the next result, where we use the Bourbaki numbering of roots (see [5]).\nProposition 3.3 Let L be a simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed\nfield F of characteristic zero, and let P be a standard maximal parabolic\nsubalgebra of L. Then P has an abelian supplement in L if and only if\nL \u223c= An and \u03a31 = {\u03b1i}, Bn and \u03a31 = {\u03b11}, Cn and \u03a31 = {\u03b1n}, Dn and\n\u03a31 = {\u03b11}, {\u03b1n\u22121} or {\u03b1n}, E6 and \u03a31 = {\u03b11}, {\u03b16}, or E7 and \u03a31 = {\u03b17}.\nProof. We have that L = P \u2295No where No is the nilradical of the opposite\nparabolic subalgebra to P . Suppose that No is not abelian, but that L =\nP + A, where A is abelian. We can embed A in a Borel subalgebra B of\nL. Then B is conjugate to a Borel subalgebra Bo containing No as its\nnilradical. Let Ao be the image of A under the conjugating automorphism.\nLet \u03b1(Bo), respectively \u03b2(Bo), be the maximal possible dimension of an\nabelian subalgebra, respectively ideal, of Bo. Then \u03b1(Bo) = \u03b2(Bo), by [6,\nProposition 2.5], so dimAo \u2264 \u03b1(Bo) = \u03b2(Bo) < dimNo if No is not abelian.\nIt follows that P has an abelian supplement precisely when No is abelian.\nBut this occurs exactly in the situations given in the result (see [15], or [3,\nTable 1, page 24]). \u0003\n4 Main results\nFirst we need to extend the results of the previous section to semisimple Lie\nalgebras.\nLemma 4.1 Let L be a semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed\nfield F of characteristic zero. Then L \u2208 MN =MA =MD if and only if\nL \u223c= A1.\nProof. Suppose that L \u2208 MN is semisimple. Clearly every simple sum-\nmand of L is isomorphic to A1, by Corollary 3.2. Suppose that L = S \u2295 S\u00af,\nwhere S \u223c= A1, S\u00af is an isomorphic copy of S with [S, S\u00af] = 0, and denote the\nimage of s \u2208 S in S\u00af by s\u00af. Let D = {s + s\u00af : s \u2208 S}, which is easily seen to\n10\nbe a maximal subalgebra of L, and suppose that L = D +N , where N is a\nnilpotent subalgebra of L. Then dimN \u2265 3.\nClearly L 6= S + N , so S \u2229 N 6= {0}. Similarly, S\u00af \u2229 N 6= {0}. Let\ns \u2208 S \u2229 N , x\u00af \u2208 S\u00af \u2229 N and let n = u + v\u00af \u2208 N , where u \u2208 S, v\u00af \u2208 S\u00af.\nThen [s, u] = [s, n] \u2208 S \u2229 N , so [s, n] = \u03bbs for some \u03bb \u2208 F , since S has no\ntwo-dimensional nilpotent subalgebras. As N is nilpotent, \u03bb = 0. But now\nFs + Fu is an abelian subalgebra of S, and so u = \u00b5s for some \u00b5 \u2208 F . In\nsimilar manner v\u00af = \u03bdx\u00af for some \u03bd \u2208 F . But this means that dimN \u2264 2, a\ncontradiction. It follows that L is simple and L \u223c= A1. The same conclusion\nfollows if L \u2208MA or L \u2208MD, by Lemma 2.2.\nThe converse is easily checked. \u0003\nTheorem 4.2 Let L be a Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of\ncharacteristic zero with solvable radical R. Then L \u2208 MD = MN if and\nonly if L is solvable or L\/R \u223c= A1.\nProof. Suppose first that L \u2208MN and L is not solvable. Then L\/R \u223c= A1\nby Lemma 4.1. If L \u2208MD the same conclusion follows from Lemma 2.2.\nSuppose now that L = R or L\/R \u223c= A1, and let M be a maximal\nsubalgebra of L. If R \u2286M then M has a supplement whose derived algebra\nis inside M , by Lemma 4.1. So suppose that R 6\u2286M . Then there is a k \u2265 0\nsuch that R(k) 6\u2286 M but R(k+1) \u2286 M . Clearly L = M + R(k) and again\nM has a supplement whose derived subalgebra is inside M . It follows that\nL \u2208MD. Lemma 2.2(ii) also implies that L \u2208MN . \u0003\nNotice that Lemma 4.1 and Proposition 2.3 imply that if L is a semisim-\nple or solvable Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic\nzero then L \u2208MA if and only if L \u2208MN . However, it is not the case that\nMA =MN , as the following example shows.\nExample 4.1 Let L be the six-dimensional Lie algebra over the complex\nfield with basis e, f, h, x0, x1, x2 and products [e, h] = 2e, [f, h] = \u22122f ,\n[e, f ] = h, [x0, h] = x0, [x1, h] = \u2212x1, [x0, f ] = x1, [x1, e] = \u2212x0, [x0, x1] =\nx2, other products being zero.\nClearly, L = R \u2295 S, where R = Cx0 + Cx1 + Cx2 is nilpotent and S =\nCe + Cf + Ch \u223c= A1. Then M = Ce + Cf + Ch + Cx2 is a maximal\nsubalgebra of L that has no abelian supplement in L.\n11\nTheorem 4.3 Let L be a Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of\ncharacteristic zero with nilradical N . Then L \u2208 MU if and only if L is\nnilpotent or L\/N \u223c= A1.\nProof. Let L \u2208 MU . Then L \u2208 MN , by Lemma 2.2, and so L is solvable\nor L\/R \u223c= A1, by Theorem 4.2. Suppose that L is solvable but not nilpotent,\nand let M be a maximal subalgebra of L with N \u2286 M . Then there is a nil\nsubalgebra U of L such that L =M + U . But now N + U is nilpotent, and\nis an ideal of L, since L2 \u2286 N , so U \u2286 N \u2286M , a contradiction.\nSo suppose now that L\/R \u223c= A1 and R is not nilpotent. Clearly L\/\u03c6(L) \u2208\nMU , so assume that L is \u03c6-free. Then L = AsocL \u2295 (C \u2295 S), where C is\nabelian and acts semisimply on AsocL, S \u223c= A1, and [S,C] = 0, by [17,\nTheorem 7.5]. Let M be a maximal subalgebra of L with AsocL+ S \u2286M .\nThere is a nil subalgebra U such that L = M + U . Since L2 \u2286 M , M\nis an ideal of L and there is a u \u2208 U such that L = M + Fu. Let u =\na + c + s, where a \u2208 AsocL, c \u2208 C, s \u2208 S. It is easy to see that since\nad (a+ c+ s) acts nilpotently on S, then s must be a nil element of S. But\nnow ad (a+c+s)|AsocL = ad (c+s)|AsocL is nilpotent. As c acts semisimply\non AsocL it follows that c \u2208 CL(AsocL) \u2286 AsocL. But then u \u2208 M , a\ncontradiction. Hence R is nilpotent.\nSuppose conversely that L is nilpotent or L\/N \u223c= A1. If the former holds\nthat then, clearly, L \u2208 MU . So suppose the latter holds and let M be a\nmaximal subalgebra of L. If N 6\u2286 M then L = M + N and N is nil. If\nN \u2286 M then M = N +M \u2229 A1. Also M \u2229 A1 is a maximal subalgebra of\nA1 and there is a nil element of A1, e say, such that L =M +Fe. But then\ne acts nilpotently on L. It follows that L \u2208MU . \u0003\nReferences\n[1] B.
