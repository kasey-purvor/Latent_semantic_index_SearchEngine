That event brought together \nSteve\u2019s friends and colleagues to celebrate the contribution that Steve had made, and \nthe impact he had had on both academia and local government. It was held to publicly \nrecognise the skilful way in which he had shown how academic work could be of use \nto practitioners, and how an analysis of practice could enhance academic \nunderstanding. It is only right that, as the leading local government academic journal, \nLocal Government Studies should recognise through its pages the influential and \nimportant work that Steve Leach has contributed throughout his career as an \nacademic. As a consequence, this issue of the journal is dedicated not only to \nhighlighting and celebrating Steve\u2019s own work, but also to marking how he has driven \nforward much academic debate and research.  \n \nSteve was a sociologist and town planner by training, and he had a solid background \nin local government practice, initially in local government as a planning officer at \nManchester and Cheshire \u2013 a county borough and a county, from 1964-1971. In 1971 \nhe moved to academic life at Liverpool Polytechnic, but kept his foot in local \ngovernment practice by lecturing in town planning.  In 1976, inspired by the writings \nof John Stewart to broaden his area of interest from town planning to local \ngovernment, he undertook the M.Soc.Sc course in Public Policy at Birmingham \nUniversity\u2019s Institute of Local Government Studies (INLOGOV).  On completion of \nthis course, he was employed as a research fellow, and he went on to spend nearly 20 \ndemanding but rewarding years at INLOGOV working on various projects with John \nStewart (with whom he co-authored The Politics of Hung Authorities in 1992) and \nwith organisational sociologists Bob Hinings and Royston Greenwood, with whom he \nworked on the SSRC research programme on central-local government relationships.  \nHis involvement in this research programme in the early 1980s led to a meeting with \nProfessor George Jones, who was chair of the programme. Steve acknowledges the \nprofound influence of George Jones and John Stewart on his thinking about local \ngovernment.   \n \nIn 1996 Steve moved to De Montfort University as Professor of Local Government. \nHere he worked with a new set of colleagues, including David Wilson, Lawrence \nPratchett and Vivien Lowndes, on a range of research projects, many of which \nfocused on the Labour Government\u2019s post-1997 democratic renewal agenda, until his \nretirement in 2009.   \n \nPolitics, Parties, Leadership and Management \n \nSteve Leach is a qualitative researcher and delves, in great depth, into the rich, \ncomplex, dynamic, often chaotic and always fascinating world of local politics and \nlocal government. Through his dedication and his focus on understanding how they \nwork, he has illuminated and strengthened our knowledge of the internal structures of \nlocal authorities, showing how elected members and officials work individually and \ntogether, and particularly illuminating their interactions. His quest to understand the \nway officers and members work has taken him into issues of politics and \nmanagement, indeed political management \u2013 above all political leadership. Together \n 1\nwith David Wilson, he produced the classic authoritative volume: Political \nLeadership in Local Government (2000).  His concern for the roles of elected \nmembers led him to examine how they were recruited, and their career patterns, and \nto make insightful assessments of their new roles of overview and scrutiny. Indeed, \nSteve helped us all to understand exactly what overview and scrutiny were, and the \npotential they displayed, when many were still trying to make any sense at all of this \nnew element in the political decision-making processes of local government. He \nrecognised, before many, that the councillor\u2019s role as a scrutinieer had long gone \nunrecognised and unarticulated; Steve filled that gap in our knowledge.  \n \nSteve has emphasised that local government involves politics and local parties, and \nthat there are different types of politics in different types of authority. He has assessed \nvarious management fashions and central government initiatives, and their impact on \nlocal government. He has made an important contribution to our understanding of the \nconsequences of the Local Government Act of 2000 and the internal political \nmanagement structures it imposed on local authorities. A major lesson of Steve\u2019s \nwork is that local government is permeated with politics; the political pressures \ncannot be ignored. One of his most important books is The Changing Role of Local \nPolitics in Britain (2006), which sums up much of his past work and is a thorough and \nauthoritative account of party organisation and dynamics  \n \nHe has also focussed on the relationships of local authorities with one another, \nexploring how authorities can work collaboratively in joint committees and joint \nboards, and suggesting that such cooperation is preferable to structural reorganisation. \nHe has assessed the consequences of structural reorganisation, from organic change \nand the abolition of the metropolitan county councils to more recent attempts to \nimpose unitary authorities on local government. Here a recent example shows yet \nagain how Steve has never been an ivory-tower academic; rather, he is someone \nprepared to roll up his sleeves and to launch himself into the fray when necessary and \nwhen an obvious wrong has been committed. Together with Michael Chisholm, in \nBotched Business (2008), he took the Department of Communities and Local \nGovernment to task for its misleading methods and for dubious figures produced to \nsupport the setting up the new unitary authorities in England in April 2009.  In this \ncase, Steve displayed a characteristic mix of academic rigour, professional expertise, \nconcern for local government and local democracy, passion for doing the right thing \nand an indignation at what he saw as an underhand disregard for the \u2018local\u2019 in local \ngovernment.  \n \n \nA Distinctive Approach to Exploring Local Government  \n \nSteve Leach\u2019s approach to his work is rooted in reality, in deeply probing and \nexploring what happens in local politics and local government management. He \ncollects empirical detail about the way local government works and his research is a \nfine example of the evidence-based approach, refining theory with the reality test, and \nin so doing building his own theories, but expressing these with caution, aware of \ntheir dependence on specific conditions. His preferred method has been not to rely \nonly on a paper trail or the use of formal structured surveys, but to interview and \nclosely observe how individuals and organisations behave, what they think they are \ndoing, and what they actually do. He uses informal interviews, observations and an \n 2\nimmersion in the world he is studying to get inside organisations and into the minds \nof practitioners of politics and management. Steve refuses to reduce the complexities, \ndynamics, interactions and activities of local politics and local government \nmanagement to sterile figures and charts. Rather, he shows a depth and richness of \nunderstanding that can only come from close association and affinity with the world \nthat is the focus of his study.  \n \nSteve has won considerable external funding from numerous consultancies over the \nyears, and he has worked closely with local authorities of all types, solving problems, \noffering advice, producing comprehensive and authoritative reports on how councils \nhave been conducting their business. The councils that have been lucky enough to \nhave Steve work with them may not all have liked what he had to say \u2013 but they knew \nthat his reports and recommendations were based on a thorough and rigorous \nunderstanding not only of their council but of the spectrum of local government. He \nhas been much in demand from the world of local government, and from central \ngovernment; and he has been skilled in devising research projects that gain grant \nmoney from foundations, commissions of inquiry, SOLACE, IdeA, and ESRC.  \n \nLocal authorities and their associations have liked the way Steve set their work in \ncontext and gave them advice that helped them tackle pressing problems. They valued \nhim not only for the quality of his work, delivered on time, but also for the way he \nwrote, without jargon, in clear direct prose that everyone could understand. Steve has \nan encyclopaedic knowledge of local government that can only be garnered from \nexperience, a depth and breadth of understanding, and a passionate concern for the \nwell-being of local government and its role in society and the governance of the \ncountry.  \n \nConclusion \n \nSteve Leach played a major role in Local Government Studies and helped to make it \nthe leading academic journal for the study of local government. He was editor of LGS \nbetween 1997 and 2003, and always had a clear vision for the journal, insisting that \nothers have it as well, and that the journal should maintain high academic standards. \nHe managed to create a journal that speaks to both academia and the practitioner \nworld in a way that few other journals do. He still sits on the editorial board, and is \nvalued and respected by his fellow board members and by the current editors of the \njournal. It is only fitting that this issue is dedicated to Steve and his work \n \nSteve is a good colleague and collaborator, generous in sharing his findings and \napproaches and in answering queries. He has produced much with others, and has \nshown himself to be a team player, listening to others\u2019 suggestions, and even taking \ntheir advice. He is marvellous as a source for keeping up-to-date, as can be seen in his \nmasterly surveys of the year\u2019s events in local government contributed to the Palgrave \nMacmillan annual reviews of British politics. He is not just focused on the present. He \nraises his eyes above the current nuts and bolts and is adept at futurology, laying out \nscenarios for different futures, not just carrying on with present trends but ingeniously \nplotting possible developments. Many organisations have found his presentations at \nseminars and conferences compelling as he probes expectations and challenges \nconventional assumptions. \n \n 3\nIt is impossible to adequately sum up or do justice to the contribution made by Steve \nLeach to academic work and local government in a necessarily brief editorial \nintroduction to an issue of this journal. In this issue, we are simply trying to recognise \nand celebrate the work of a valued, trusted and close friend, someone who is a \ncolleague to all of those exploring and working in the world of local government.  \n \nWe do this in two ways: first by publishing two papers from Steve himself, one at the \nbeginning and one at the end of the issue. The first paper is a review and analysis of \nthe six themes that have dominated the Labour government\u2019s thinking and actions in \nregard to local government: local executive government; strong local leadership; \npartnership working; the performance\/inspection culture; community cohesion \n(primarily at the neighbourhood level); and further moves towards a unitary structure \nof local government in England. Steve takes these themes and explores the impact \nthey have had on the relationships between officers and members in local \ngovernment. In his second paper, Steve explores the process of de-politicisation and \nenhanced managerialism which he describes as a \u2018government-led process\u2019. He \ntackles this with reference to a particular view of local politics that developed at the \nAudit Commission and which was displayed through the CPA process. Here, Steve \ndefends the right of local government to be political and for councils to develop a \npolicy agenda that reflects the priorities and wishes of local people.  \n \nSecondly, in this issue we publish a number of papers that reflect themes and areas of \nstudy that Steve has focused on throughout his career, and on which he has had a \nconsiderable impact.  The second paper in this issue is written by two of Steve\u2019s \ncolleague at De Montfort University, Vivien Lowndes and Catherine Durose, who \nhave worked with Steve on numerous projects. The paper explores how civic, social, \npolitical and economic rationales for neighbourhood working have been taken up at \ndifferent levels within the City of Manchester. They throw light on the definitional \nproblems that beleaguer notions of \u2018neighbourhood\u2019 and alight on a definition that \ndepends on the purpose for, and the recipients of, a transfer of power within a locality. \nThey also highlight the importance of politics and political power in understanding \nnotions of neighbourhood.  \n \nIn the third paper Michael Thrasher and his colleagues set out the results of research \namongst local election candidates that sought to explain the nature of the current \ncomposition of the councilor population. It also examines the role of political parties \nin the recruitment of councillors and the effect parties have on local elections. The \npaper sets out to explain why the councilor population is as it is and whether the \nunder-representation of certain groups is a deliberate result of political exclusion or \nwhether it is a result of a greater or lesser inclination on the part of some to become \ninvolved in local politics and political parties.  \n \nThe fourth paper, by Stuart Wilks-Heeg, was originally presented at an ESRC seminar \nas part of a seminar series award made to Steve Leach and Colin Copus. In the paper, \nWilks-Heeg uses case-study material from Burnley and Harrogate to examine the \nstate of local party politics and to account for the condition in which he finds those \nparties. He highlights the problems associated with a dislocation between local party \npolitics and local political participation, and sees the development of a local political \npluralism \u2013 more players in local politics \u2013 as a possible solution to the problem \nidentified.  \n 4\n \nThe next two papers provide a welcome indication of how Steve Leach has informed, \nand been part of, international academic debates. In the fifth paper, which explores \nanother theme which Steve has made very much his, Merel De Groot, Bas Denters \nand Pieter-Jan Klop examine, from a Dutch perspective, the affect on the role of the \ncouncilor of reforms introduced by the Dutch 2002 Local Government Act. They \nexamine particularly how a set of central government inspired reforms have \ninfluenced \u2013 or not \u2013 the role orientations of councillors in the Netherlands, and \nwhether or not the scrutiny role is seen as a valuable and effective activity for the \ncouncillor. It appears that the Dutch debate in this area is much the same as that in \nEngland.  \n \nIn our sixth paper, Ulrik Kjaer and J\u00f8rgen Elklit focus on other issues close to Steve \nLeach\u2019s heart, this time from a Danish empirical base, as they discuss the relationship \nbetween municipal size and party politics at both local and national level. The paper \nexamines how, in the larger municipalities, the political system comes to resemble the \nnational political system and the effect this has on local politics and government. The \npaper offers us an interesting and useful tool to consider the \u2018localness\u2019 of local \npolitics.  \n \nFrom the collection of papers in this issue we see the breadth and depth of current \napproaches to those areas of local government studies that have particularly benefitted \nfrom the influence and involvement of Steve Leach. Those familiar with these areas \nwill be able to recognise the many points on which he has influenced academic \nthinking and conceptualising \u2013 points that together delineate a major role played in \nthe study of local government. \n \nOn a personal note, and as someone following in the footsteps of Steve Leach as \neditor of Local Government Studies, one of the authors of this introduction would like \nto add a personal note of thanks to Steve for the support, encouragement and \nfriendship he has shown him over the years. Colin Copus remembers the first paper he \nwrote for Local Government Studies, which was submitted while Steve was editor: a \npaper that was roughly hacked from Colin\u2019s PhD thesis, and which was hugely over-\nlong, showed no recognition of the style guidelines for the journal, and displayed \nmuch of his own personal bias about party politics in local government. Any other \neditor would probably have rejected that paper and possible ended a nascent academic \ncareer; but Steve saw something in the paper that was worth saving, and with his \ncareful guidance colin got not only my first publication, but publication in Local \nGovernment Studies, no less. That, and Steve\u2019s support, time generously given, and \npatience and advice over the years, have resulted in Colin being where he is today.   \n \nIt is our great good luck that Steve Leach, although now retired, has begun the sort of \nretirement that the best academics embrace \u2013 academics like George Jones (co-author \nof this introduction) John Stewart and Michael Goldsmith to name but a few. Now \nEmeritus Professor of Local Government at De Montfort University, Steve just keeps \non going academically. And we should be thankful for that.  \n \nProfessors George Jones and Colin Copus \n \n 5\n"}
