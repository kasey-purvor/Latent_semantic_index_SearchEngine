Introduction\nThe interest in modelling chemotherapy protocols to support\nclinical insight is driven by efforts to improve outcomes by\nadjusting drug scheduling (Browder et al., 2000; Citron et al.,\n2002; Fallik et al., 2003; Midgley and Kerr, 2005) and is illustrated\nby the seminal work of Norton and Simon (1976, 1986). This led to\ntheir initial hypothesis, namely that chemotherapy results in a\nrate of regression in tumour volume that is proportional to the\nrate of growth for an unperturbed tumour of the same size.\nFurther work resulted in the influential concepts of dose\nintensification and especially dose densification. These constitute\nprotocol escalation via either reducing rest phases, i.e. densifica-\ntion, or increasing drug dosage, i.e. intensification, and were\npredicted to increase the probability of tumour eradication\n(Norton, 1998, 1997, 2001). In particular the dose densification\nstrategy was tested in a series of clinical trials by the Cancer and\nLeukaemia Group B (CALGB) and the American Breast Intergroup\n(Citron et al., 2002, 2003). The results supported the theory that\ndose dense treatment would lead to a significant improvement in\nclinical outcomes, additionally exemplifying how a mathematical\nmodel can make successful predictions for improved chemother-\napy protocols (Piccart-Gebhart, 2003). This is further highlighted\nby recent phase I trials with a novel Capecitabine schedule for\nmetastatic breast cancer (Tiffany et al., 2008). However, onell rights reserved.\nonro),should also note that, in general, regimens utilising protocol\nescalation, either by dose densing or intensification, yield variable\nresults (Piccart et al., 2000).\nThe focus of Norton and Simon\u2019s modelling strategies was to\nmaximise cell kill; other objectives have been considered in the\nliterature. For example, whereas Norton and Simon neglect\ngenetic mutation to resistance, Goldie and Coldman (Goldie\net al., 1982) modelled chemotherapy scheduling with the goal of\nminimising the development of drug resistance. Resistance was\nassumed to be a result of random genetic mutation to a resistant\nstate (Goldie and Coldman, 1998). This assumption was based on\nthe Nobel Prize winning work of Luria and Delbruck (1943), who\nshowed that bacterial cultures developed resistance to bacter-\niophages at random. Spontaneous mutation has also been found\nto arise in in vitro cancer cell systems (Jaffrezou et al., 1994;\nSummer and Handshumacher, 1973), and Law (1952) later found\nthat the same applied to methotrexate resistance in vivo with\nleukaemic L1210 cells.\nThe Goldie\u2013Coldman model focuses on maximising the\nprobability that no tumour cells will have mutated sufficiently\nto become resistant to all drugs present. When more than one\nnon-cross-resistant chemotherapeutic is used, it was predicted\nthat the drugs should be alternated as quickly as possible in order\nto reduce the occurrence of resistant cells, thus maximising the\nprobability of cure (Goldie et al., 1982). Evidence supporting this\nhypothesis has been sought in numerous clinical trials (De Placido\net al., 1995; Sieber et al., 2002; Siodlak et al., 1990), though it is\ntypically refuted rather than validated. Gaffney (2004, 2005)\nextended the Goldie and Coldman model to consider cell cycle\nphase specific drugs and the effects of drug delivery. It was shown\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nH.C. Monro, E.A. Gaffney \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 257 (2009) 292\u2013302 293that the Goldie and Coldman\u2019s alternation hypothesis often breaks\ndown both due to the effects of pharmacokinetics and due to\nresonances between the application time of a cell cycle phase\nspecific drug and the tumour cell cycle time.\nHowever, such models focus on cure, as do virtually all the\nmodels in the literature. In contrast, we will investigate the\nconsequences of protocols when tumour eradication does not\noccur, either in the context of palliation or failed cure, and\nwhether this reveals the need to consider different protocol\nstrategies.\nIn particular, models have traditionally predicted that an\nincreased dose will yield an increased response, at least within\nany implicit or explicit toxicity constraints. However, lower doses\nof chemotherapy may indeed lead to longer survival outcomes in\nthe absence of cure. The failure of an aggressive chemotherapy\nschedule could occur due to the preferential removal of sensitive\ncells, leaving behind a population more resistant as a whole. At\nextremes, a non-curative but escalated chemotherapeutic regimen\ncould be expected to leave behind an uncontrollable mass of cells\ninsensitive to any further therapy. In contrast, too low a dose will\nallow even cells that are sensitive to the drug to grow out of\ncontrol. Therefore we immediately have the question of whether\none can reasonably anticipate that an intermediate level of\nchemotherapy will restrict tumour growth and increase survival\nduration in the palliative setting.\nProtocol escalation is in conflict with the above reasoning, as\nescalation requires either a higher dosage of chemotherapy, a\nshorter administration time, or both. The source of this disagree-\nment arises from the different objectives. The aim of protocol\nescalation is to improve the chances of eradicating the tumour;\nour above reasoning is based upon prolonging survival when\ntumour eradication is not possible. However, it cannot always be\ncertain whether a tumour is curable or not. This emphasises that\nthe effect of an attempted, but unsuccessful, curative protocol\nescalation on survival time also needs to considered in modelling\nchemotherapy scheduling and we will investigate this in detail.\nWe note that there is experimental evidence supporting the\nconcept that lower chemotherapy doses could be preferable in the\npresence of resistance. In particular an investigation by Aabo et al.\n(1994) showed that low-dose chemotherapy delayed the relapse\nof a dominated and resistant sub-population in a human\nsmall-cell lung cancer (SCLC) xenograft in mice. The xenograft\nconsisted of an artificially mixed BCNU-sensitive, dominating\nsub-population and a BCNU-resistant, undetectable (dominated)\nsub-population, where BCNU is an anti-cancer drug. At the time of\ntumour regrowth after low-dose treatment, most of the tumours\ncontinued to be dominated by the sensitive population, and thus\nremain susceptible to chemical control. At the time of regrowth\nafter the response to high-dose treatment, the resistant cell line\nwas the predominant population.\nSimilar concepts to those presented in this paper have been\ndetailed in the modelling study of Hahnfeldt et al. (2003) with\nparticular emphasis on the anti-angiogenic effects of metronomic\nchemotherapy, which is a low-dose drug scheduling regime. Such\nregimens are observed to differentially target the endothelial cells\nof the growing blood vessels found in tumours (Bello et al., 2001;\nBertolini et al., 2003; Browder et al., 2000; Kerbel and Kamen,\n2004; Man et al., 2002), therefore inhibiting angiogenesis. The\nmodel of Hahnfeldt et al. (2003) focuses on how heterogeneity in\nresensitisation rates between tumour and endothelial cells can\nprovide a logical framework explaining such observations. Our\nmodel has an analogous mathematical framework though the\ncentral focus here is tumour cell heterogeneity per se rather than\nthe difference between endothelial and tumour cells. This\nvariation is primarily one of model interpretation; the core\ndifference is that Hahnfeldt et al.\u2019s model considers exponentialcell growth. In contrast, we consider Gompertzian tumour\ngrowth; this is a constant, exponential, retardation of the growth\nrate which has been found to provide a good empirical description\nof the decelerating growth curves exhibited by more advanced\ntumours (Simpson-Herren and Lloyd, 1970; Sullivan and Salmon,\n1972). The Gompertz (1825) model was first applied in actuarial\nstatistics, and subsequently in the study of growth by Winsor\n(1932), with Laird (1964) further illustrating that the growth for a\nvariety of primary and transplanted tumours in the mouse, rat and\nrabbit satisfied the Gompertzian relation.\nGompertzian growth is critical in this paper as it provides the\ntheoretical basis of protocol escalation (Norton, 1997) in addition\nto being highly relevant for advanced tumours (Simpson-Herren\nand Lloyd, 1970; Sullivan and Salmon, 1972). For example,\nreducing a protocol\u2019s rest phase entails that a Gompertzian\ntumour is growing at faster and faster rates at each drug\napplication since each application yields a smaller tumour. By\nthe eponymous Norton\u2013Simon hypothesis this compounds a\ngreater and greater cell kill effect. This compounding entails that\nprotocol outcomes are anticipated to be very sensitive to the dose\ndensing effect. Such dynamics thus need to be explicitly\nconsidered when investigating protocols involving advanced\ntumours and when examining the consequences of dose densing,\nor more generally protocol escalation, and is central to our model.\nIn Section 2, the development of the model for palliative\nchemotherapy applied to advanced tumour growth will be\noutlined. Two main sections ofresults and discussion will follow.\nIn Section 3.1 we consider continuous chemotherapy for our\ninitial investigation into the effects of protocol escalation in the\npalliative setting. In Section 3.2, we proceed to consider protocol\nescalation for cycles of drug administration interspersed with rest\nphases. This study is subsequently extended to the case where the\ntumour is only just incurable to allow us to investigate the\nrelationship between survival time and protocol escalation for a\nfailed curative attempt. Finally, we discuss our results and\nobservations in Section 4.2. The model\nThe assumptions of the model are:\u0002 Tumour growth is represented by a continuous, Gompertzian,\nmodel.\u0002 The effect of the chemotherapeutic on the sensitive cells is to\ninduce a regression rate proportional to the unperturbed\ngrowth rate, in accordance with the Norton\u2013Simon hypothesis\n(Norton and Simon, 1976).\u0002 The chemotherapeutic induces sensitive tumour cell kill in\nproportion to the intensity of the administration.\u0002 Mutation to resistance is Darwinian (Law, 1952; Luria and\nDelbruck, 1943) at a rate proportional to the growth rate of the\ntumour (Goldie and Coldman, 1998).\u0002 Toxicity constraints are not explicitly considered.\nThe final assumption requires further comment. For continuous\nprotocols we seek to reduce the dosages of chemotherapy, which\ncan be reasonably considered to reduce toxicity. When consider-\ning protocols with rest phases, dose densification is also a feasible\noption as we have the freedom to reduce the rest phases. This,\nhowever, may potentially lead to intolerable toxicity; while this\nhas been observed (Piccart et al., 2000), there is empirical\nevidence it also need not be the case (Citron et al., 2003; Simon\nand Norton, 2006). Thus, should we draw a conclusion that\nprotocol escalation via dose densification yields gains, it is, like\nprevious work on this topic, ultimately qualified by an assumption\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nH.C. Monro, E.A. Gaffney \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 257 (2009) 292\u2013302294that dose densing does not generate intolerable toxicity. However,\nshould the modelling predict that dose densification is inap-\npropriate even under the assumption that dose densing is\ntolerable, then the explicit inclusion of a toxic constraint will\nnot alter this conclusion. Consequently, we can draw relevant and\nnon-trivial conclusions without the complications of a toxic\nconstraint.\nThe above assumptions lead to the following equations:\ndNS\u00f0t\u00de\ndt\n\u00bc \u0003b ln N\u00f0t\u00de\nN1\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u00bdNS\u00f0t\u00de \u0003 lC\u00f0t\u00deNS\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe t2NR\u00f0t\u00de \u0003 t1NS\u00f0t\u00de\u0004, (1)\ndNR\u00f0t\u00de\ndt\n\u00bc \u0003b ln N\u00f0t\u00de\nN1\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u00bdNR\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe t1NS\u00f0t\u00de \u0003 t2NR\u00f0t\u00de\u0004, (2)\nwhere NS\u00f0t\u00de and NR\u00f0t\u00de represent the number of cells that are,\nrespectively, sensitive and resistant to chemotherapy, and N\u00f0t\u00de\nrepresents the total number of cells.

We also have the relation\nb ln\u00f0N1=N0\u00de \u00bc aN0 , (3)\nwhere aN0 is the instantaneous growth rate of the tumour at the\nstart of the simulation and b provides a measure of the rate of\nincrease of the Gompertzian curve modelling tumour growth.\nThe parameter t1 governs the rate of mutation of sensitive cells\nto resistance while t2 governs the rate of back-mutation from\nresistance to sensitivity. There is a subtlety in the interpretation of\nour mutation rates, the discussion of which is deferred to the\nAppendix.\nWe now consider the chemotherapy termwhich consists of l, a\nmeasure of the potency of the chemotherapeutic, and C\u00f0t\u00de, the\nconcentration of the chemotherapeutic agent at time t. Through-\nout the paper, lC\u00f0t\u00de is either a non-zero constant, C0, correspond-\ning to the presence of chemotherapy, or zero, according to the\ndetails of the drug protocol and its scheduling.

This effective reduction in b for the sensitive\ntumour cells, with N1 fixed, is consistent with the growth curve\nmeasurements of Bru\u00a8nner et al. (1989) on comparing control and\ntreated tumours. Additionally, the effect of the chemotherapeutic\nis proportional to the growth rate of the tumour and hence the\nmodel is explicitly in accord with the Norton\u2013Simon hypothesis\nby design, and also with our assumption of linearity in the effect\nof the chemotherapeutic. Clearly the above representation of drug\naction does not incorporate cell cycle phase specificity, which\nrequires tracking the cell cycle within the model. Finally, while\none could in principle interpret Eq. (4) as entailing that the\nchemotherapeutic had an anti-proliferative effect we only\nconsider the chemotherapeutic to upregulate cell death in the\npresentation below.\nAs detailed further in the Appendix, the simulations are\ninitiated from a single sensitive seed, NS\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1, NR\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0. This\nseed is allowed to grow, producing a tumour with a mix of\nsensitive and resistant cells. Once this tumour is at a size\nconsistent with the start of a palliative protocol, the chemother-\napeutic protocol is switched on. The tumour cell number burden\nat chemotherapy initiation is defined to be Nch. Unless stated\notherwise, we take this to be\nNch \u00bc N0int \u00bc\ndef\n1010 cells,\nwhere N0int corresponds to a tumour of radius of about 1.5 cm and\nis within the range of sizes reported for colorectal liver metastases\nat the start of palliative treatment (Becker et al., 1999). However,\nbecause the protocol start point is likely to be highly variable we\ndo investigate the effects of altering the tumour cell burden at\nchemotherapy initiation.\nThe critical (fatal) level of the tumour is taken to be Ncrit cells,\nand the time at which this is reached is denoted Tcrit .

This\ntable also lists variables predicted by the model, such as survival\ntime.\nBy adjusting the drug protocol in the modelling appropriately,\nwe can consider numerous palliative and failed cure chemother-\napy regimens to investigate the effects of dose densification or\nother scheduling strategies on survival time when tumour control\nis lost. Given the model consists of a small number of ordinary\ndifferential equations, our use of an Euler method for numerical\nsimulations is amply sufficient; there are no stability difficulties\nnor inconvenient computational overheads.\nIn Section 3.1 we focus on continuous palliative chemotherapy,\nfor either a specified finite period or an indefinite infusion. The\neffects of the rate of cell kill, the size of the tumour at\nchemotherapy initiation and the duration of therapy on the\nsurvival time are investigated. In Section 3.2 regimens with a\nspecified number of doses are simulated with varying rest phase\ndurations. The resulting changes in the survival time are\ninvestigated, as are the effects of altering the rate of cell kill and\nthe initiation time of chemotherapy.Fig. 2. Evolution of numbers of sensitive \u00f0NS\u00de, resistant \u00f0NR\u00de and total \u00f0N\u00de cell\npopulations during indefinite, continuous chemotherapy.

Plots A, B and C represent\nthree different values of chemotherapy cell kill, C0, corresponding to points A, B\nand C in Fig. 1.

Essentially, there is an\noptimal balance between the drug directly killing sensitive cells\nand indirectly promoting the production of resistant cells that\ndetermines the maximum survival time.\nDue to variability in the likely start point of palliative\ntreatment, we vary Nch, the tumour cell burden at the start of\nchemotherapy. The survival time, Ts, once more the time to death\nfrom our reference tumour cell burden point of N0int cells in the\nabsence of chemotherapy, is plotted against cell kill, C0, for\ndifferent values of tumour cell number at the start of chemother-\napy; see Fig. 3. Note the survival time is measured from this\nreference tumour cell burden point rather than the chemotherapy\ninitiation time to give an absolute comparison between the\nregimes in terms of overall survival as opposed to survival\nfollowing chemotherapy. The maximum survival times, denoted\nTmax, from graphs such as those in Fig. 3 are plotted against\nthe tumour cell number at chemotherapy initiation Nch, in Fig. 4A.\nThe value of the chemotherapy cell kill level which maximises the\nsurvival time is shown in Fig. 4D.\nTlim is the limiting value of the survival time, Ts, as the sensitive\ncell kill tends to infinity.

These are plotted with as the initial\ntumour burden varies in Fig. 4B (Tmax \u0003 Tlim) and Fig. 4C (Tlim).Note that the model predicts that survival time increases with\ndelayed chemotherapy, at least providing the model is valid,\ni.e. that the increased chemotherapy dosing required for optimal\ncontrol, and the increased tumour size do not exceed tolerable\nlimits. However, the survival time then drops dramatically as the\ninitial tumour cell number reaches 5\u0005 1011 cells, simply because\nthe initial tumour size approaches the fatal tumour size.\n3.1.2. Finite continuous chemotherapy\nChemotherapy is usually administered for a fixed period of\ntime, rather than ongoing indefinitely, so finite drug schedules are\nalso considered. The start-time of the therapy is once more taken\nto coincide with a tumour cell burden of N0int \u00bc 1010 cells in the\nfollowing sections. The intended chemotherapy duration, denoted\ndch, is then varied; the actual duration is cut short if the tumour\ncell number reaches the fatal limit during the protocol. Here the\ntotal amount of chemotherapy administered is considered since\nthe schedules are finite; this is commonly represented as the\n\u2018\u2018Area under (the) Curve\u2019\u2019, denoted AuC, of the treatment\nAuC \u00bc C0dch.\nSurvival time is plotted against AuC for different values of therapy\nduration, dch, in Fig. 5. The maximum survival time for each dch, on\nvariation of the area under curve, is plotted in Fig. 6A and denoted\nTmax. Analogously to Fig. 4C, Tlim is the limit of the survival time as\nthe chemotherapeutic sensitive cell kill, and thus the area under\ncurve, tends to infinity; Tmax \u0003 Tlim is plotted in Fig. 6B. The values\nof AuC and C0 corresponding to the maximal survival time are\nalso shown.\nNote the model predicts that for a fixed chemotherapeutic\nduration, an intermediate level of chemotherapeutic, as measured\nby the area under curve, produces optimal results and that this\neffect is emphasised for longer protocols. In addition, up to a\nthreshold, we also have the prediction that increasing the\nduration of the protocol, with a concomitant reduction in the\nlevel of cell kill, can also increase survival time.\n3.2. Protocols with rest phases\nWe proceed to consider protocol escalation when rest phases\nare present; in addition to dose intensification by increasing\nchemotherapeutic cell kill, we can also investigate dose densifica-\ntion by reducing the rest phase duration.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nT m\nax\n (d\nay\ns)\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n0\n200\n400\nT m\nax\n\u2212T\nlim\n (d\nay\ns)\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n0\n1\n2\n3\nx 104\nC\nor\nre\nsp\n.

Testing dose densification for palliative protocols. Plot A gives the\nmaximum of the survival time with respect to variations of the rest phase, for\neach fixed value of the number of drug doses, Ncyc , and the cell kill C0. Plot B\nsimilarly depicts the difference between this maximum of the survival time and\nthe survival time in the limit that the rest phase tends to zero. Plot C gives the rest\nphase corresponding to the maximum survival time.\nH.C. Monro, E.A. Gaffney \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 257 (2009) 292\u2013302 297In the following, we vary the number of chemotherapy doses,\ndenoted Ncyc , the drug cell kill, C0, and the rest period between the\ndoses, denoted trest . For definiteness, the duration of each\nadministration is taken to be three days, but the choice of this\nvalue does not affect the qualitative form of the model\u2019s results.\nFig. 7 shows how the survival time varies with the rest phase\nduration trest , and the number of doses Ncyc , for three different,\nfixed, values of the drug cell kill C0. These results are extended in\nFig. 8; firstly, there is a plot of the maximum survival time, Tmax,\nwith respect to variations of the rest phase, for each fixed value of\nthe number of drug doses, Ncyc , and the cell kill C0. Let T0 denote\nthe survival time for the limit of no rest phase; Tmax \u0003 T0 is\nplotted, which shows the difference between the most judicious\nchoice of rest phase and the most extreme dose densing protocol.\nIn addition, the rest phase at which Tmax occurs is depicted,\nshowing that the optimal rest phase is, in large regions of\nparameter space, of significant duration.\nNote from Fig. 7 that when a tumour cannot be eliminated, and\nthe level of chemotherapeutic cell kill is held fixed, then protocol\nescalation by reducing the rest phase duration and increasing the\nnumber of cycles can lead to equivocal results. Similarly, dose\nintensification, by increasing the chemotherapeutic cell kill\nkeeping other protocol parameters fixed, also can lead to\nsubstantial reductions or increases in survival time.\nHowever, from Fig. 8, when the chemotherapeutic cell kill, rest\nphase duration and number of cycles are all treated as degree of\nfreedoms with which to maximise the survival time, there are\nlarge regions of parameter space where dose densification is not\noptimal.The effect of varying the tumour cell number at chemotherapy\ninitiation, Nch, in the current context is explored in Fig. 9. Here the\nrate of cell kill C0 is fixed; for each value of Nch and Ncyc , the rest\nphase between the doses is varied and the maximum survival\ntime, Tmax, found as shown in Fig. 9A. The difference between Tmax\nand the survival time in the absence of rest phases, denoted T0, is\nplotted in Fig. 9B. The rest phase which yields the maximal\nsurvival time is depicted in Fig. 9C. The sharp cut off in survival\ntime as the tumour burden increases is due to the fact the\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 9.

Gaffney \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 257 (2009) 292\u2013302298chemotherapy starts too late for the initial stages of treatment to\nprevent the tumour reaching its fatal size.\nIn summary, we can observe that protocol escalation need not\nyield significant improvements especially when given sufficient\nfreedom to vary the scheduling parameters. In addition, the model\npredicts that survival time increases with delayed chemotherapy,\nat least providing the subsequent increased chemotherapy dosing\nand tumour size do not exceed tolerable limits.\n3.2.1. Dose densification for marginally incurable tumours\nIt is of particular interest to highlight the effect of dose\ndensification for a tumour that is only just incurable, as this is\nwhere it is most likely that a dose dense regime may be\nadministered and fail to eradicate the tumour. A tumour will be\nconsidered \u2018\u2018cured\u2019\u2019 when the cell number falls below a threshold\nlevel, denoted by Ncure which we take to be 400 cells. Actual cure\nmay have to be effected by other mechanisms given drug\nresistance. One possible example is a subsequent administration\nof a second drug or treatment; another is immunosurveillance\n(Liu et al., 2008).\nSince here we are considering a potentially curative regimen,\nrather than palliation, a number of parameters are adjusted, as\nsummarised in Table 2. In particular, we consider a scenario with a\nsmaller tumour load at the chemotherapy initiation, and a less\nresilient tumour, that is a lower mutation rate to resistance. Thus,\nthe therapy starting point is taken to be around 4\u0005 107 cells\nrather than the earlier reference point of 1010 cells; the mutation\nrate, and back mutation rate per cell cycle are given by\nt1 \u00bc t2 \u00bc 2e\u0003 7; see the Appendix for further details.\nWe consider an initial tumour load of Nch \u00bc 4\u0005 107 cells, plus a\nprotocol with a rest phase, denoted trest , which intersperses a\ngiven number of administrations of a chemotherapeutic, denotedNcyc . Each administration is taken to be of three days\u2019 duration. We\nfirstly determine the rate of cell kill, C0, for which the dose dense\nlimit of such a protocol, with no rest phases, only just induces\ncure. By this we mean the global minimum of the total tumour\ncell number for all time is equal to Ncure. The value of C0 that we\nfind is, of course, dependent on the given value of Ncyc , and is\nplotted in Fig. 10A. The parameter values for these results, and\nthose below, which are not listed in Table 2 are given in Table 1;\nadditional details can be found in the Appendix.\nTo ensure the tumour is incurable, but only just, we subse-\nquently simulate, for each value of Ncyc and the value of C0 plotted\nin Fig. 10A, a tumour with a slightly larger initial tumour cell\nnumber. Thus Nch now satisfies\n0o Nch\n4\u0005 107\n\u0003 151;\nthe simulation is otherwise unchanged. Consequently, not even\nthe most extreme dose densing, corresponding to the limit of the\nrest phase tending to zero, can bring the tumour cell number\nbelow the cure threshold. If the chemotherapeutic cell kill level\nwere to be raised above C0 plotted in Fig. 10A, cure would be\nachieved, by construction, so this is excluded given the context of\na failed curative attempt.\nWe do assume though that C0 corresponds to a tolerable, and\nthus maximally tolerable, dose. Furthermore, given maximal cell\nkill is the intention of the dose densing regimen, and thus the\nlevel of cell kill is intended to be as high as possible, we do not\nreduce the chemotherapeutic cell kill level from the values plotted\nFig. 10A in the subsequent results.\nIn Fig. 10B each point in the plot gives the maximal survival\ntime as the rest phase is varied in a simulation of the marginally\nincurable tumour. The difference between the maximum survival\ntime and the survival time in the dose densing limit of no rest\nphase is also plotted in Fig. 10C. Finally, the value of the rest phase\nwhich induces the maximal survival time is given in Fig. 10D.\nThe shading in this figure illustrates where a wide range of rest\nphases produce survival times very close to the maximum survival\ntimes. Thus, while we have plotted the rest phase which yields the\nmaximum, one cannot infer significant information about the optimal\nrest phase other than survival times are relatively insensitive to the\nchoice of the rest phase in this region of parameter space.\nOne can observe the model prediction that when there is a low\nnumber of drug administration cycles, dose densing does not\nsubstantially influence survival times for a marginally incurable\ntumour. However, should one consider larger numbers of cycles,\nthe loss of survival time induced by dose densing on a marginal\nfailure of chemotherapy is predicted to be significant. The precise\nnumber of administrations that is required before dose densing is\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 10.

Discussion\n4.1. Continuous chemotherapy\n4.1.1. Indefinite continuous protocols\nThe results from indefinite continuous chemotherapy, as\nillustrated in Fig. 1, support the hypothesis that intermediatepalliative doses of chemotherapy yield higher survival times\ncompared to higher doses.\nA more detailed examination of the cell population dynamics\nfor drug doses around this optimum level reveals the reason for\nthis behaviour; see Fig. 2. At lower doses, the chemotherapy\ncannot control the sensitive cell growth, resulting in the total cell\nnumber exceeding the fatal level relatively quickly. Increasing the\ncell kill, C0, improves the control over the sensitive cells, thus\nincreasing the survival time, until it reaches the maximum. At this\noptimal value of cell kill, the balance between controlling the\nsensitive cells and maintaining enough sensitive cells to restrict\nthe growth of the resistant compartment via competition is such\nthat the tumour burden remains below the critical level for the\nlongest time.\nAlthough the detrimental effect of maximal dose intensifica-\ntion on survival time in Fig. 3 is most pronounced for larger\ntumours, it is still predicted to result in significantly shorter\nsurvival for protocols initiated with smaller tumours.\nIn Fig. 4, it can be also seen that the survival time can be longer\nwhen the chemotherapy is started later and the initial tumour is\nlarger, but only if the level of chemotherapy is higher. On first\ninspection, this suggests that chemotherapy should be delayed\nand a stronger dose administered. The mechanism is that the\ndelay in therapy allows more sensitive cells to accumulate, so they\nare able to restrict the resistant cell population for longer, though\na more aggressive chemotherapy dose is subsequently required.\nThis behaviour does need to be viewed critically though, given the\nloss of model validity and the quality of life, due to the impact of\ntumour induced morbidity and chemotherapeutic toxicity at large\ndelays of the chemotherapeutic start time.\nNonetheless, one does have the prediction that proactively\nstarting treatment early for a cancer which is ultimately incurable\ndue to drug resistance, as may happen in the adjuvant setting or\nwith cancer screening, can adversely skew survival curves.\n4.1.2. Finite continuous protocols\nWhere the treatment duration is continuous, but of a fixed and\nfinite duration, Fig. 5 shows that the survival time rises to a\nmaximum and then decreases as the area under curve is\nincreased. This again supports the \u2018\u2018less is more\u2019\u2019 concept that\nless intense chemotherapy in palliation can lead to improved\nresults. This result is also observed to be significantly more\npronounced for longer treatment duration; analogously, on\nconsidering the chemotherapy duration as an adjustable para-\nmeter, our results also reveal that the survival time can be higher\nfor longer, less intense protocols.\n4.2. Protocols with rest phases\nIn Fig. 7 we consider protocols with a given number of drug\nadministrations, interspersed with rest phases, for three fixed\nvalues of chemotherapeutic cell kill. Where the survival time rises\nas the rest phase is lengthened, less dense schedules lead to an\nimproved outcome, as in Fig. 7C. This occurs in an analogous way\nto the previous sections, where dose densing leads to sensitive cell\ndeath and thus less competitive control over resistant cells.\nHowever, for lower drug cell kill, as in Fig. 7A, Norton and Simon\u2019s\nprediction for dose densification holds, as the survival time only\ndecreases as the rest phase increases. Here shorter rest phases are\nrequired in order to administer sufficient cell kill to control the\nsensitive population.\nFigs. 8A and B show that when the chemotherapeutic cell kill\nand the number of cycles are fixed, the survival time is maximised\nby dose densing only for protocols which are either short or which\nhave relatively low levels of chemotherapeutic cell kill. Most\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nH.C. Monro, E.A. Gaffney \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 257 (2009) 292\u2013302300importantly, these figures reveal that on taking cell kill, rest phase\nand number of drug administrations as adjustable parameters the\noptimal results do not coincide with the most intense or dense\nprotocol. Thus, again, \u2018\u2018less is more\u2019\u2019 in the general palliative\nsetting and protocol escalation does not provide a means of\nuniversally, or even typically, finding optimal outcomes in\ncontrast to the concepts introduced by Norton and Simon (1976,\n1986).\nSimilarly to the continuous chemotherapy case, Fig. 9 shows\nthat delaying the chemotherapy start time in the dose densifica-\ntion context can lead to increased survival time, especially for\nlonger protocol durations. Whereas the higher survival times in\nthe previous case were achieved with higher rate of cell kill (see\nFig. 4), here the rate of cell kill is fixed and the higher survival\ntimes are achieved with shorter rest phases between doses. Again\nthis is due to a higher number of sensitive cells being present to\nrestrict the growth of the resistant cells preventing the early\nemergence of near total tumour resistance. As previously, this\naspect of the model\u2019s behaviour must be interpreted critically,\nespecially at high levels of tumour burden. Nonetheless, it again\nillustrates a modelling prediction that very early palliation of an\naggressive tumour can have a detrimental effect on survival time.\nIt is of particular interest to consider a marginally incurable\ntumour as this is a likely scenario for the implementation\nof a dose dense regimen that fails to induce tumour eradication.\nIn Fig. 10B, whenever the difference between the maximum\nsurvival time and the survival time with no rest phases, is equal or\nclose to zero, the maximal dose dense schedule with no rest\nphases is optimal or close to optimal. As with all predictions that\nprotocol escalation is an appropriate strategy, it is qualified by\nassumption that dose densification does not lead to intolerable\ntoxicity.\nInspection of Fig. 10 for larger numbers of drug administra-\ntions, also shows that dose densification can readily have a\ndetrimental effect on the patient\u2019s survival time in the absence of\ntumour eradication, which would adversely skew modelling\npredictions of the protocols\u2019 survival curves. This does have to\nbe balanced against the benefits in terms of an increased\nprobability of cure that Norton and Simon\u2019s modelling predicts\nwill emerge from protocol escalation.4.3. General discussion\nAs previously remarked, the modelling concepts presented by\nNorton and Simon (1976, 1986) and Norton (1998, 1997, 2001),\nwhich generally advocate protocol escalation, contrast the\nmodelling predictions of Hahnfeldt et al. (2003). The latter, based\non exponential growth models, suggests that regimens based\nupon maximally tolerated chemotherapeutic doses are often not\nthe most appropriate means of tumour treatment. Here, we have\nfocussed on the setting where the chemotherapeutic cannot\ncontrol tumour growth indefinitely with a model similar to\nHahnfeldt et al. apart from the inclusion of Gompertzian growth.\nThus the modelling incorporates the mechanisms underlying the\nstudies by both groups and can therefore be used to consider\nwhich mechanisms, and thus which conclusions, are most\nappropriate in the current setting.\nGompertzian dynamics can have a substantial effect for\nprotocols with rest phases. While protocol escalation is inap-\npropriate for continuous infusions, there are regions of parameter\nspace for a marginally incurable tumour where dose densification\ndoes not reduce survival times extensively should the attempted\ncure fail. Such regions are generally restricted to when the tumour\nis marginally incurable (and thus in practice there is a significant\nprobability of cure) and the protocol is relatively short andintense. Given from the studies of Norton and Simon that dose\ndensification can improve the probability of cure in such\ncircumstances, it is clearly an appropriate strategy in this setting\ngiven tolerable toxicity.\nHowever, in contrast, curative attempts involving sufficiently\nprotracted protocols are predicted to have survival times in the\nabsence of cure which are adversely affected by dose densifica-\ntion. This would severely and adversely skew modelling predic-\ntions of survival curves due to the sub-population who were not\ncured. Thus, one cannot draw definitive conclusions about\nwhether protocol escalation is appropriate within the current\nmodelling study. However, it is clearly illustrated that the\nmodelling of dose densing strategies should not only consider\nthe probability of cure, but also whether survival times are greatly\nreduced for failed protocols before drawing conclusions.\nIn the palliative setting, less is indeed more for chemotherapy\nand, for general protocols, protocol escalation leads to poorer\noutcomes in concordance with the modelling of Hahnfeldt et al.\n(2003). More generally, the model presented here reconciles the\ntwo competing concepts of Norton and Simon (1976, 1986) and\nNorton (1998, 1997, 2001) and Hahnfeldt et al. (2003) within a\nsingle framework. Our conclusions thus additionally demonstrate\nthat both frameworks can be valid according to context.\nIn summary, this model is based on well founded approxima-\ntions: Gompertzian tumour growth, log cell kill by chemotherapy\nand Luria\u2013Delbruck mutation to resistance, with results that are\nrobust to parameter variation. We have modelling predictions that\npalliative continuous chemotherapy achieves optimal results for\nintermediate rather than high dosage levels with later rather than\nearlier intervention (subject to tolerability) due to the effects of\ncompetition between resistant and sensitive cells. It has been\nshown that protocol escalation via dose densification or dose\nintensification, will not yield benefits in the clearly palliative\nsetting given sufficient freedom in protocol scheduling. In\naddition, very early palliation is predicted to lead to lower\nsurvival times. Finally, dose densification for a marginally\nincurable tumour will often, but need not, adversely affect\nsurvival time and thus skew predictions for the survival curve,\nespecially for protocols with sufficiently large numbers of drug\nadministrations.\nThe relevance of these observations are highlighted by the\ntentative consideration of single agent dose densification for the\novarian palliative setting (Vasey, 2005). This modelling clearly\nindicates that the gains predicted by Norton\u2013Simon type model-\nling should not necessarily be expected in the context of cell cycle\nphase non-specific drugs used in the ovarian setting, such as\ncisplatin (Gorczyca et al., 1993; Vasey, 2005).\nScheduling for colorectal palliation is also a current area of\ninvestigation, including the potential role of regional continuous\ninfusions (Fallik et al., 2003). While the above modelling of\ncontinuous infusions is insightful, a direct application of the\ncurrent study in the context of colorectal palliation highlights the\nneed to model combination protocols in future work. This requires\nnumerous generalisations of the current study, including a\nheterogeneous spectrum of tumour resistance, cell cycle phase\nspecificity, multiple drugs and the difference between regional\nand systemic treatments, especially in terms of metastases.Acknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by the Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council, UK (EPSRC GR\/S72023\/01).

Gaffney \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 257 (2009) 292\u2013302 301Appendix A. Additional details and parameter values\nA.1. Initial conditions\nIn the simulations the tumour is grown from an initial single,\ndrug sensitive, seed with\nN\u00f0t \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc NS\u00f0t \u00bc 0\u00de \u0006 N0 \u00bc 1\nand\nNR\u00f0t \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc 0\nprior to the start of the chemotherapy. The initial stages are not\nconsistent with a continuum model; however, once the cell\nnumbers are larger this does provide a representative initial\ndistribution of sensitive and resistant cells for subsequent study.\nFurthermore, the general robustness of the modelling framework\nto parameter variations entails that the conclusions we draw are\ninsensitive to the consequences of neglected fluctuations in these\ninitial stages of the tumour development. Thus a more sophisti-\ncated treatment of the initial dynamics would be an unnecessary\ncomplication.\nA.2. Gompertzian growth curve parameters\nFor colorectal cancer, the doubling time T is approximately\n96h (Rew and Wilson, 2000), so aN0 , the instantaneous specific\ngrowth rate of the tumour at time t \u00bc 0 can be calculated:\naN0 \u00bc\nln 2\nT\n\u00bc 7\u0005 10\u00033 h\u00031.\nN1 is the theoretical number of cells at which the tumour growth\ncurve would saturate; however, this is beyond the tumour size\nconsidered to be fatal so would not be reached in reality. The\ndiameter of this beyond-fatal tumour size is taken to be about\n16 cm, i.e. N1 \u00bc 2\u0005 1012 cells. Thus we have\nN1 \u00bc N0 exp\naN0\nb\n\u0002 \u0003\n) b \u00bc 2:47\u0005 10\u00034 h\u00031.\nFor the above value of b note that an advanced, near fatal, tumour\nwith N\u00074\u0005 1011 cells has a doubling time of about 72 days, which\nis the correct order of magnitude to match observations that, in\nclinic, tumours can have doubling rates of the order of 100 days\n(Rew and Wilson, 2000).\nBy non-dimensionalising with respect to time, one can see\nthat altering b is equivalent to changing the units of time. The\noverall dynamics are otherwise unchanged, assuming protocol\nrest phases and drug administration durations are also scaled.\nThus our conclusions hold for a family of values of b. For example,\nif we were to use the 12.5 days doubling time of ovarian cancer\n(Rew and Wilson, 2000), we would find b is reduced; with a\nsuitable rescaling of time, conclusions are unchanged.\nA.3. Tumour cell burden levels\nWe take, as reference, a nominal initiation point for che-\nmotherapy to be a tumour cell burden of N0int \u00bc 1010 cells,\ncorresponding to a tumour of roughly 1.5 cm in radius which is\nin the range of tumour sizes reported for patients initiating\npalliative care for non-resectable colorectal liver metastases\n(Becker et al., 1999). However, in practice, this is likely to be\nvariable, so we also consider the effects of adjusting this\nparameter in the main text. In the context of failed cure in this\npaper, we take a much smaller initial tumour, with 4\u0005 107 cells at\nthe start of treatment, which corresponds to a micrometastatic\ntumour of about 2mm in radius. Note that micrometastases are a\ntherapeutic target, as they are often anticipated to be presentfollowing post primary tumour resection ultimately leading to\nrecurrence (Midgley and Kerr, 1999, 2000). In all simulations, the\nfatal radius of the tumour is taken to be Ncrit \u00bc 5\u0005 1011 cells,\nwhich corresponds to a tumour of diameter of approximately\n10 cm.\nA.4. Mutation to resistance\nAs mentioned in the main text, the interpretation of our\nmodelling representation of mutation contains a subtlety. In\nparticular, the rate of mutation is proportional to the growth rate\nas considered in previous modelling (Goldie and Coldman, 1998).\nHowever, the underlying principle for mutation is that it is due to\ngenetic errors occurring during replication and thus, in the\nabsence of further empirical information, the mutation rate\nshould be proportional to the proliferation rate.\nOne can, nonetheless, readily consider the errors involved with\nour modelling framework. Denote the proliferative rate by P and\nthe inherent (drug independent) rate of cell loss by L so that the\ninherent (drug independent) growth rate is P \u0003 L. Further, let\nj \u00bcdef L\nP\n, (5)\ndenote the cell loss factor, which is commonly measured in\ntumour cell kinetic studies. For humans j is typically observed to\nbe greater than 0.5 with a median value of 0.77 in a large study of\nhuman tumours (see Hall and Giaccia, 2006 and references\ntherein) and values around 0.9 are also reported (e.g. Wickrama-\nnayake et al., 1985).\nIn terms of model parameters, the mutation rates per cell cycle\nbetween the sensitive and resistant compartments are\n\u00f01\u0003j\u00det1\nln 2\n;\n\u00f01\u0003j\u00det2\nln 2\n.\nAssuming the mutation rate per cell cycle is constant, our\nmodelling framework has a systematic error in that we are then\nforced to assume j is constant. While in occasional studies this\nhas been observed to be the case, e.g. Looney et al. (1971),\ngenerally j increases with tumour size. In particular, in observa-\ntions of human tumour xenografts j is observed to be at least\n0.46 in the exponential phase of growth and at most 0.91 as the\nplateau phase is reached, with respective mean values of 0.56 and\n0.85, as reported by Wickramanayake et al. (1985). Thus, taking an\nintermediate value of j our mutation rates have an error of at\nmost a factor of 2.4 for the extremal values of j reported by\nWickramanayake et al. (1985) and about 1.7 for the mean values.\nEven if we assume no cell loss in the early stages of growth, an\nintermediate value of j will still be limited to a factor-three error.\nHowever, the model conclusions are robust to changes in the\nmutation rate. Thus, by neglecting the effect of the variation of the\ncell loss fraction during tumour growth we have a much simpler\nmodel, which need not separately track cell loss and yet we have\nconclusions which are insensitive to such details. Thus our\nmodelling simplification is entirely appropriate for this initial,\nproof of principle, study.\nWe proceed to estimate the parameters t1, t2. The rate of\nmutation per cell cycle has been estimated in the experimental\nliterature to be of the order of O\u00f010\u00037210\u00034\u00de (Goldie and\nColdman, 1998), while\n\u00f01\u0003j\u00det1\nln 2\n;\n\u00f01\u0003j\u00det2\nln 2\ngive the mutation rate per cell doubling time in the model. Thus,\nin the palliative setting t1 and t2 are taken to be 10\u00036.\nSignificantly less aggressive tumours, with t1 and t2 given by 2\u0005\n10\u00037 are considered in the context of failed cure; such an extreme\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nH.C. Monro, E.A. Gaffney \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 257 (2009) 292\u2013302302lack of aggression is required for cure to be possible in the model.\nAt the initiation point for the palliative setting, the number of\nresistant cells present is about 105 given the above choice of\nmutation rates. Similarly, in the context of failed cure, the smaller\ntumour initiation point and the smaller mutation rate entails that\nthere are about 140 resistant cells present, which is still sufficient\nto justify a continuum model.\nA.5. Final remarks\nThe nature of this field of modelling entails that the parameter\nvalues we use, as detailed above, are invariably estimates and will\nvary between different drugs, tumours and patients. However, the\nqualitative structure of the dynamics we have observed is robust\nto variations in our estimates at least providing palliation, or\nfailed cure according to context, is feasible. For example, rapid\nprogression to death with effectively no scheduling dependence\noccurs when the chemotherapeutic is so weak as to have\nessentially no control whatsoever over the tumour. However, the\ncharacteristics of the dynamics we have illustrated, and the\nconclusions we drawn, are retained for sensible parameter space\nsamplings where the chemotherapeutic can reasonably be\nconsidered as having a realistic palliative, or curative, effect\naccording to context.\nReferences\nAabo, K., Vindelov, L.L., Christenson, I.J., Spang-Thomsen, M., 1994.
