Applying the national business systems approach our study centres on the use \nof calculative human resource management (HRM) practices by subsidiaries of US \nmultinational companies in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Denmark\/Norway and Australia, \nrespectively, in comparison with these countries\u2019 indigenous firms. The analysis indicates \nthat while US subsidiaries adapt to the local setting in terms of applying calculative HRM \npractices, they also diverge from indigenous firm practices.      \n  \n \nIntroduction \n \n \nThe purpose of this article is to study the degree to which national institutional settings \nimpact on managerial practices in foreign subsidiaries of multinational companies \n(MNCs). We address the question as to whether such subsidiaries will transfer and apply \npractices that are prevalent in the country-of-origin or whether they will adapt to the local \ninstitutional environment. This question will be approached through an analysis of the \napplication of three characteristically US human resource management (HRM) practices, \nindividual performance appraisals, individual rewards systems or merit pay, and monitoring \nof the effectiveness of training, in indigenous firms and subsidiaries of US multinational \ncompanies located in four European settings, the UK, Ireland, Germany and \nDenmark\/Norway, together with Australia. On the basis of institutional theory we test \nhypotheses concerning differences in the application of these practices between US \nsubsidiaries and indigenous firms in all five countries, between indigenous firms by \ncountry and between US subsidiaries by country.  \n. \nTheoretical Background \nDuring the last decades a broad array of research focusing on institutional determinants of \nmanagerial and organizational practices has been published. Different directions can be \ndistinguished, carrying labels such as varieties of capitalism (Hall & Soskice, 2001; 2003; \nHall & Gingerich, 2004), national business systems (Whitley, 1992; 1999), work systems \n(Geppert et al., 2003), cultural systems (e.g., Myloni et al., 2004) and new institutional \norganizaton theory (e.g., Powell and DiMaggio, 1991; Scott, 1995). Although these \ntheoretical perspectives diverge on important dimensions, they all share the conception \nthat institutional factors are more important antecedents of management practices than are \nrational factors, such as technology, firm size, and industrial embeddedness. Institutional \nfactors have evolved as a result of long historical processes that have generated significant \nnational and regional differences. The point of departure is the notion that social \ninstitutions contribute heavily to the development and use of various administrative \npractices and systems in firms and other organizations (e.g., Whitley, 1992; Whitley, \n1999; Maurice & Sorge, 2000; Hall & Soskice, 2001). This approach has increasingly \nbeen applied in comparative empirical studies of the actual application of managerial and \norganizational practices in different countries and regions (Gooderham et al., 1998, 1999; \nGeppert et al., 2002; Geppert, 2002; Geppert et al., 2003; Sorge, 2004). \n  Moreover, there is a growing body of work focusing on the transfer of such practices \nacross countries through the operations of multinational companies, which is also the \nfocus of this article (Ferner, 1997; Gooderham et al., 1998; Schuler & Rogovsky, 1998; \nEdwards & Ferner, 2000; Ferner, 2000; Ferner, 2003; Harzing & Sorge, 2003). Kostova \nand Roth (2002:215) have argued that an important source of competitive advantage for \nMNCs is the utilization of their organizational capabilities on a worldwide basis through \nthe leveraging of their management practices across their subsidiaries. However, they also \npoint to the need subsidiaries have to achieve and maintain legitimacy in the environment \nin which they operate (Gooderham et al., 1999). That is they experience pressure to adopt \nlocal practices and become isomorphic with the local institutional context. Hereby there \nlies a tension between the need for global integration, on the one hand, and local \nadaptation, on the other. At the subsidiary level this is experienced as two sets of \npressures. They are both confronted by an external host country institutional environment \nand by pressures from within the organization to become isomorphic to the parent \norganization\u2019s norms (Harzing, 2002:213).  \n   The implication is that the degree of global integration should vary according to the \ndegree to which the local institutional context the subsidiary confronts differs from the \nnorms of the parent organization. By extension, because these norms will be substantially \nderived from the parent organization\u2019s own institutional environment, the degree of local \nadaptation will reflect the degree of divergence between the local institutional context and \nthe parent institutional context. In this article we will empirically test this proposition by \nanalysing the degree to which characteristically US HRM practices are applied by \nsubsidiaries of US MNCs in Australia and across four European settings, the UK, Ireland, \nGermany, and Denmark\/Norway combined.  \n  Standard neo-institutional explanations of management practices and strategies predict \nsimilarity among firms that operate in the same industry or organizational field within the \ncontext of a single society or national economy (DiMaggio and Powell, 1991; Dobbin, \nSutton, Meyer and Scott, 1993; Gulati, 1999; Hitt et al., 2004; Peng, 2005; Peng et al., \n2005). While one may expect differences between industries, within industries and not \nleast within firms, firms will implement those practices that are deemed to contribute to \nthe achievement of external legitimacy. Although new institutionalism in organizational \ntheory implies a rejection of rational actor models, emphasizing instead the pressures for \nacquiring and maintaining legitimacy in relation to the environment (see, e.g. DiMaggio, \n1983; DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Powell and DiMaggio, 1991), it shares the broad, \nlong- term expectation that uniform pressures will lead to intra-industry uniformity of \nmanagement practices (McNamara et al., 2002). That is, they both presuppose \nisomorphism. \n  This is in contrast with the growing body of literature that has been assigned the label \nnational business systems in which the focus is on national cultures and unique societal \nand institutional structures and how these support dissimilar business and management \npractices (Mayer and Whittington, 2002). That is, these two research directions diverge \nradically in regard to the convergence of practices across different national settings. While \nthe neo-institutionalist reasoning assumes a dissemination of standard management \npractices and a subsequent development towards universality of practice across the MNC \nregardless of national setting, the national business systems approach research is \npreoccupied with the sustainability of the influence of national culture and institutions on \nsuch practices.  Hence, in terms of the national business systems perspective, MNCs will \ntend to be sensitive to the possibility of significant cross-national differences in \nmanagement practices. Additionally, on the basis the national business systems approach \nit is reasonable to postulate that the degree to which a foreign subsidiary will deviate in \nterms of its management practices will be determined by the degree to which the national, \ninstitutional setting of the parent company diverges from that of the subsidiary.   \n   As this article focuses on the potential adaptations made by subsidiaries of US MNCs \nacross different national settings, we will firstly delineate the institutional setting of US \nMNCs and the resultant characteristic US HRM practices. Thereafter we will briefly \ndescribe the institutional contexts of the five selected national settings. This will form the \nbasis on which we formulate and test our three hypotheses. \n \nThe US Context and Calculative HRM Practices \n   Weinstein and Kochan (1995) divide US employment relations from the late 1930s to \nthe present day into two phases, the New Deal industrial relations system, which extended \nfrom the 1930s through the 1970s and more recent developments, which we will refer to \nas US HRM.  \n   In the 1970s, American mass production grappled with the persistent effects of \nincreased international competition and a more uncertain business environment. New \nflexible productive techniques emerged in the wake of advances in information \ntechnology stimulating a shift in competitive strategy toward flexible specialization aimed \nat producing differentiated, high-value-added products (Piore and Sabel, 1984). Coupled \nto these changes were significant changes to the institutional environment in which unions \nbecame increasingly marginalized while management and shareholders increased their \npower. In this, as Weinstein and Kochan (1995:27) observe, \"Government played an \nimportant role by weakening its enforcement of labour and employment laws and by \nallowing (some would say encouraging) a harder line by management in its resistance to \nunions\". As Ferner (2000) and Ferner et al. (2004) argue the American business system \nthat emerged can be understood as a distinctive model of economic organisation within \nthe general category of \u201cliberal market economies\u201d. It is characterized by a dominant \nindividualist ethos and a strong anti-union mentality among many American employers. \nOverall, pay and performance management became characterized by the innovative use of \nperformance systems, including merit pay and forced distributions. Thus the new model \nthat emerged was different in that whereas wages in the traditional system had been \nattached to jobs rather than individuals, in the new model there was a pronounced move to \ntie wages to individual performance and competency in the form of individual incentives.  \nIt is in terms of this context, characterized by substantial firm autonomy, that Tichy, \nFombrun, and Devanna\u2019s (1984) HRM model is to be understood: that is, a model that \nemphasizes the systematic use of individual performance appraisals, individual \nperformance-related rewards and outcomes-monitored training and development. \n   In summary, US HRM, with its stress on the close synchronization of human resource \npolicies and activities with the overall business strategy through efficient reward and \nappraisal systems and development monitoring systems, is essentially indicative of a \nrational, calculative approach (Gooderham, et al., 1999). While based on an assumption of \nemployer-employee unanimity, this is a unitarist rather a social partnership approach \n(Sparrow and Hiltrop, 1994). \n  It is important to note that we do not pretend in any way to cover HRM as a whole but \nthat we focus on indicators of the calculative approach to managing human resources, that \nis, individual performance appraisal, individual rewards systems, and monitoring of the \neffects of training.  \n \nNational Contexts \n   In his book Capitalisme contre Capitalisme (1991) Michel Albert distinguished on the \none hand between US or \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 capitalism and on the other a continental, West \nEuropean type of capitalism which he labelled the \u2018Rhineland model\u2019. The former is a \n\u2018shareholder economy\u2019 under which private enterprise is about maximising short-term \nprofits for investors rather than any broader harmony of interests. In contrast \u201c\u2026the \nRhineland model may be viewed as a regulated market economy with a comprehensive \nsystem of social security. Government, employers' organisations and labour unions \nconsult each other about economic goals (in order to) try to achieve a harmony of \ninterests\u201d (Bolkestein, 1999). In short the Rhineland model is a \u2018stakeholder economy\u2019 in \nwhich competition and confrontation is avoided in the belief that it undermines \nsustainable, stable economic growth. Patrolling this economy is the state, which variously \nacts as a referee, guarantor, employer and owner.  \n  A more recent distinction within the national business systems approach is between the \n\u201cliberal market economies\u201d (LMEs) of the US, the UK, Ireland and Australia and the \n\u201ccoordinated market economies\u201d (CMEs) of much of Continental Europe (Hall and \nSoskice, 2001).  Firms operating in the latter context are regarded as significantly more \ninstitutionally embedded than those in the former, in the sense that they operate within \ncontexts whose legal frameworks and systems of industrial relations constrain them from \napplying market driven or technologically contingent management practices particularly \nin regard to pay policy. Whereas in LMEs there are substantial pay differentials even \nwithin the same industries, in CMEs much pay negotiation occurs at the industry level, \ntaking pay negotiation out of the workplace.  \n   At a general level in Europe substantial firm autonomy and weak trade unions is the \nexception rather than the rule. Thus Pieper (1990:8) has concluded that \u201c\u2026The major \ndifference between HRM in the US and in Western Europe is the degree to which [HRM] \nis influenced and determined by state regulations.  Companies have a narrower scope of \nchoice in regard to personnel management than in the US\u201d.  Let us review the archetypal \nCME setting, Germany and thereafter the Scandinavian setting, as illustrated by Denmark \nand Norway.   \n \n \n \nGermany  \n   Although unionization in German work-life has dropped considerably since the 1970s, \nand in 1994 was down to 30 percent, over 90 percent of the workforce is covered by \ncollective bargaining agreements which are the exclusive territory of the labor unions in a \nsystem of regional, industry-wide bargaining (Scholz, 1996). In addition, attention should \nbe drawn to the elaborate German system of co-determination, which is regulated at the \nplant level by the Works Constitution Act of 1972 and at the enterprise level by the Works \nConstitution Act of 1952, superseded by the \u201cMitbestimmungsgesetz\u201d (MitbestG) of \n1976 (cf. Hollingsworth, 1997). As a consequence of this legislation, employers need to \nmaintain positive relations with the works councils. These are powerful, employee-elected \nbodies legally entitled to co-determination, consultation, and access to important \ninformation, hence restricting the degree of managerial autonomy (Scholz, 1996; Streeck, \n1997; W\u00e4chter and M\u00fcller-Camen, 2002; W\u00e4chter and Stengelhofen, 1995).  \n   This is not to say that various techniques associated with the calculative HRM model are \ncompletely absent but that their potential use has invariably been subject to the critical eye \nof the works councils (Lane, 1994). Not least, these councils have also sought to preserve \nthe strong traditions of social welfare that have characterized employers' treatment of their \nhuman resources.  \n   Hassel (1999) has claimed that German industrial relations have been eroded during the \nlast two decades. One important aspect to her \u201cerosion\u201d thesis is that the institutional base \nof the German industrial system has not been able to transfer its institutions into the \ngrowing segment of small and medium-sized companies in the private service sector. In \nother words the German industrial relations system is increasingly concentrated on large \ncompanies in the manufacturing sector. Opposing this thesis Klikauer (2002) argues that \nthe system remains intact and that any changes relate to unification and the public sector.  \nTo underpin this argument he inter alia employs Hassel\u2019s own data that shows that 97.2 \nper cent of all workplaces above 300 workers have works councils. While we do not aim \nat resolving this debate it should be pointed out the data set we will employ in this paper \nexcludes smaller firms, i.e. firms with fewer than one hundred employees. Furthermore, as \nwe will indicate, our analysis controls for the effect of sector or industry. In other words \nour analysis is largely concerned with what Hassel (1999: 502) refers to as \u201cthe backbone \nof the German model\u201d that is indisputably characterized not only by powerful labor \nrepresentative bodies but also by strong work legislation. Hence, in terms of the context of \nour analysis low scores on calculative HRM can be expected not only for indigenous \nGerman firms, but also for subsidiaries of US MNCs. \n \nDenmark and Norway  \n   In a comparison of the legislative environment for work-life in Denmark and Norway \nGraver (1995) observes that in both of these countries there is a strong and pronounced \nframework intended to ensure that conflicts are resolved at the firm-level. In both \ncountries, in regard to issues relating to major structural changes, such as downsizing, \noutsourcing, and potential mergers, labor unions are legally entitled to be consulted.  \nHowever, as Graver (1995) indicates, the legislative framework is more general than that \nof Germany thereby permitting experiments with novel HRM practices. In summary, we \nfind that in Denmark and Norway labor unions generally both possess and exert \nconsiderable influence on the management of firms (B\u00e9vort, Pedersen and Sundbo, 1995). \nTogether with the fact that individual rights of employees are strongly protected by laws \nand agreements this means that the general autonomy of management is significantly \nrestricted (Kristensen, 1992). The consequence should be that the personnel functions of \nsubsidiaries of US MNCs as well as indigenous firms have limited latitude to apply \ncalculative practices.   \n   Thus far we have reviewed two prototypical Western European stakeholder settings. \nHowever, within Europe there are two markedly deviant national settings. The first of \nthese is the United Kingdom the other is Ireland.  \n \nUnited Kingdom \n   The United Kingdom is unique in the European context in that during the 1980s its \nemployment legislation was subject to radical changes. Most notably, this legislation \nincludes the Employment Acts of 1980, 1982, 1988 and 1990, and the Trade Union Act of \n1984. Coupled to these acts are severe civil penalties. Together, these acts curbed the \nunions' right to recognition, outlawed the closed shop and secondary picketing, and \nnarrowed the freedom of unions to call strikes (for instance, by a requirement that a secret \nballot of the members is to be called first). The result was a considerable increase in \ngeneral managerial autonomy (Edwards et al., 1992) and the opportunity to innovate in \nemployment and labor strategies (Mabey and Iles, 1996; Rubery and Wilkinson, 1994). In \na review of trends in HRM in the UK based on the Workplace Employee Relations Survey \nfrom 1998, Richbell (2002) observes that this opportunity has resulted in a pronounced \nmove away from standard pay scales towards systems which reflect individual \nperformance and behaviour such as the increased use of the core calculative practice of \nperformance related pay. \n In summary, given the change in institutional context in the UK, it is reasonable to \nexpect that not only do indigenous firms demonstrate a propensity for the adoption of \ncalculative practices but that subsidiaries of US MNCs will also freely apply their \ncalculative HRM practices. \n Australia \n  In the early part of the twentieth century Australia developed a system of industrial \nrelations characterized by compulsory arbitration (Dabscheck, 2004). That is, state \nagencies gained the authority to settle disputes and make binding agreements that \nprescribed wages and working conditions.  However, Barry and Wailes (2004) observe \nthat this system was so significantly modified in 1993 with the introduction of the \nIndustrial Relations Reform Act that it is questionable whether it is possible to speak of an \narbitral model in Australia after this point in time. Not only did it limit the terms and \nconditions of bargaining but it also effectively created the possibility of legally sanctioned \nnon-union agreements.  The Workplace Relations Act of 1996 further constrained the \nscope of the authority of the Australian arbitration system in regard to non-union \nindividual agreements.  The resultant fragmentation of channels of wage determination \nproduced substantial fragmentation of wage outcomes.  Changes in legislation were \naccompanied by major decline in unionization: in 1992 39.6 per cent of the Australian \nworkforce were members of trade unions, in 1999 it was 25.7 per cent (Barry and Wailes, \n2004).   \n  In the light of these radical changes to the Australian regulatory framework as well the \nempirical evidence of divergent wage outcomes it seems reasonable to expect that we may \nobserve the adoption of calculative HRM practices by indigenous firms. In addition the \nregulatory framework means that subsidiaries of US MNCs will also be free to apply their \ncalculative HRM practices within the Australian context. \n  \n \nIreland   \nThe Irish national context is ostensibly contiguous with that of the Rhineland context in \nthat trade unions enjoy strong legitimacy and collective bargaining rights. The trade union \nmovement is a key actor in shaping economic and social policy in its role as a \u201csocial \npartner\u201d (Gunnigle et al., 2002). However, since the early 1980s Ireland may be \ndistinguished from Rhineland Europe in that its pursuit of foreign direct investment has \ncaused it to grant legitimacy to \u201cgreen-field\u201d sites, which allow firms generous amounts of \nfreedom to decide their preferred form of industrial relations (Gunnigle and McGuire, \n2001). Significantly, research has indicated that it is primarily US MNCs that have used \nthis latitude to pursue a unitary style of management characterized by a strong level of \ncalculative HRM practices combined with non-union agreements (Gunnigle et al., 1997).   \n \nHypotheses \n   On the basis of the above we may hypothesize as follows:  \nHypothesis 1: The use of calculative HRM practices will be significantly higher in US \nsubsidiaries than in indigenous firms in all countries. \n \nHypothesis 2: The use of calculative HRM practices will be significantly lower in \nindigenous German, Danish\/Norwegian and Irish firms than in indigenous UK and \nAustralian firms. \n \nHypothesis 3: The use of calculative HRM practices in US subsidiaries will be \nsignificantly lower in Germany and Denmark\/Norway than in the UK, Ireland and \nAustralia. \n \nMethods \nTo test our predictions we have employed data derived from the 1999 Euronet-Cranfield \nsurvey of HRM in European and a range of non-European countries. The overall strategy of \nthe survey has been to mail appropriately translated questionnaires to personnel managers in \nrepresentative national samples of firms with more than one hundred employees (Brewster et \nal., 1996). Although the response rate for the individual countries is relatively low, mostly \nbetween 20 and 35 per cent, analyses suggest that statistical representativeness has not been \nimpaired (Brewster et al., 1994).  \n   Our initial sample comprised 3,186 private sector firms located in the UK, Ireland, \nDenmark\/Norway, (former West) Germany and Australia. After removing firms that were \nneither indigenous nor fully-owned US subsidiaries our net sample consisted of 2769 firms. \nFor the UK the sample comprised 988 firms, for Ireland 349, for Denmark\/Norway 753, for \nGermany 456, and for Australia 223.The percentage of US owned firms varies from a low of \n4 percent in Denmark\/Norway, through 8 and 11 per cent respectively in Germany and the \nUK respectively to 22  per cent in Ireland, and 23 per cent in Australia.  These marked \nnational differences in the proportion of US owned firms in our sample are not surprising \ngiven the very different shares of foreign ownership in each of the economies (OECD, 2001). \n \nThe Mokken Scaling Model \nTo develop the scales for calculative HRM-practices we have used Mokken\u2019s latent trait \nmodel for unidimensional scaling (Sijtsma & Molenaar 2002). The model was first \ndeveloped for dichotomous \u201c0 \u2013 1\u201d-items as used in our application.  A Mokken scale \nbuilds on the idea of cumulativeness in Guttman's approach, but  the probabilistic nature \nof Mokken\u2019s model allows for non-perfect response patterns. The probability of success \n(score \u201c1\u201d) on a particular items depends on the subject\u2019s (firm\u2019s) location on the latent \ntrait, and is called its item response function (IRT). These functions may have the shape of \na logistic curve. This is assumed in the parametric IRT models where the IRTs for \ndifferent items differ only in the parameters of the logistic curve.  Mokken\u2019s model of \nmonotone homogeneity poses no other restrictions than increasing IRFs and is designed to \norder subjects on the latent trait (Sijtsma & Molenaar 2002). A Mokken scale is \nnonparametric in the sense that the IRF curve does not have to have a special form. This \nmakes the model very flexible, but also implies that neither the subject (firm) parameters \nnor the item parameters may be estimated directly. However, the unweighted sum of item \nscores is monotonously related to the latent true score (Sijtsma & Molenaar 2002: 15). This \nmeans that the Mokken model only provides estimates of scale scores at an ordinal level, \nwhereas parametric IRT models allow for direct estimation of the true scores. However, \nthe strong assumptions of the latter models contribute to limiting their applicability.  \n    The primary scaling criterion is Loevinger\u2019s H coefficient of homogeneity. This is \ndefined as: Hij = 1 - (Fij \/Eij), where Fij is the sum of observed errors according to the \nGuttman scale model (i.e., the observed number of respondents who give a negative \nresponse to the \"easier\" item and a positive response to the more  \"difficult\" item), and Eij \nis the expected number of errors assuming that the responses to the items are independent \nacross persons and that the marginal distributions are fixed (Sijtsma & Molenaar 2002). In \nthe same way, the scalability of a single item with respect to the other items is defined by \nHi, and the scalability of the total scale is measured by H. A set of items constitutes a scale \nif all Hij >0, and if every item coefficient of scalability, Hi , is larger than a constant c, set \nto at least 0.30. All Hi and the H should be significantly greater than zero according to a \ngiven level of significance. The total scale ought to have an H-value of at least 0.30 to \nform a weak scale. H-values between 0.40 and 0.50 indicate average scales and values \nabove 0.50 indicate strong scales. The Mokken scaling model is implemented in the \ncomputer program MSP5 for Windows (Molenaar and Sijtsma, 2000).  \n    \n       The Dependent Variable \n  In order to measure the use of calculative HRM-practices we have developed a Calc \nscale based on 10 dichotomous items from the Euronet-Cranfield questionnaire : \n\u201cindividual performance appraisals\u201d (items ca1-ca4), \u201cindividual rewards systems\u201d (items \nca5-ca8), and \u201cmonitoring the effectiveness of training\u201d (items ca9, ca10). The scale was \nconstructed using Mokken\u2019s scaling model as implemented in the MSP5 for5 Windows.  \nTable 1 shows all items, ordered by sample difficulties, that is, by their means. As all \nitems are dichotomous (0 - 1), the means are the proportion of firms employing the \nmanagement practice in question.  The cumulative nature of the items in Table 1 is \nevident. Performance appraisals are more commonly used than merit pay. Within the two \ngroups of items, the hierarchy is also evident. Merit pay for manuals is less frequent than \nfor professionals and managers. Performance appraisals for managers are much more \nfrequently used than performance appraisals for manuals. Taken together this indicates \nthat a cumulative scaling model is appropriate  \n   The main output from MSP5 is the H-statistic displayed in the second column of Table \n1. The H-value for the Calc scale is 0.52 and indicates a strong scale. The reliability \nanalysis also gave satisfactory results. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.85, shows that the scale\u2019s \ninternal consistency is well above the standard minimum of 0.7. The average inter-item \ncorrelation of 0.36 is also satisfactory. On the whole, the item-scale correlations are \nsatisfactory (i.e. > 0.30). In conclusion, the 10-item scale of calculative HRM practices \nperforms satisfactorily both in terms of scalability and reliability. \n----------------------------- \nInsert Table 1 about here \n----------------------------- \n \n    The Calc scale scores for each firm is calculated as the mean values of valid scores, i.e. \n0 or 1, on the items, and multiplied by 100 so that the resulting scale varies between 0 and \n100. Cases with valid values on less than seven indicators are coded as missing. High \nscores indicate extensive use of calculative HRM-practices.  \n Independent variables \n   In addition to Country, our study includes four additional independent variables: \nindustry, size, the strategy or market orientation of the firm, and the date when the \nfirm was established in its particular setting.   \n   Institutional theory assumes that industries develop along particular trajectories \ncharacterized by distinct economic and organizational dynamics that distinguish them \nfrom other industries (Hollingsworth et al., 1993). Because of this we include a \nvariable that distinguishes manufacturing from banking and finance, construction, \ntransport, personal services and other industries.  \n   As noted by Scott (1998), most studies of the relation between organizational size \nand structure indicate that size, in terms of the number of employees, tends to influence \nthe methods used for controlling and coordinating employees. The evidence suggests \nthat the larger the size of the organization, the more standardization of HRM \nprocedures (Pugh and Hickson, 1969).  \n   The strategy of the firm is measured in terms of whether its main market is local or \ninternational.  It is reasonable to suppose that subsidiaries of MNCs that are oriented \ntowards purely local markets will be more prone to adapt to local institutional \nconditions than those whose function is global in the sense that they are producing for \ninternational markets. Likewise it may be supposed that indigenous firms with a global \norientation will be more inclined to look beyond local best practices. \n   Finally we distinguish between firms that have been in the institutional setting for \ntwenty years or more and more recent creations. The latter may be supposed to be less \ninfused by the norms of the local environment than the former. \n \nResults \nTable 2 documents the variables to be used in the regression analysis. The dependent \nvariable is the Calc scale with a mean of 51 in our sample and a standard deviation of \n30.4. Lnsize is the natural logarithm of firm size, i.e. the number of employees. \nIndustry is a categorical regressor represented by five 0 \u2013 1-variables with \nManufacturing as the reference category. Another two dummy variables represent \nwhether the main market for the firm is abroad and whether the firm is established \nrecently, i.e. in the period 1980-99. Country is a categorical regressor represented by \ndummy variables for Ireland, Denmark\/Norway (grouped together), Germany and \nAustralia, with the UK as the reference category. USS indicates whether the firm is \nUS owned (USS=1) or indigenous (USS=0). Finally, we have the four USS by \nCountry interaction terms: USS*IR, USS*Den\/Nor, USS*Ger, and USS*AUS.  \n \n----------------------------- \nInsert Table 2 about here \n----------------------------- \n \nThe multiple regression analysis with Calc as the dependent variable is documented in \nTable 3. The first set of regressors function as controls: firm size, industry, the \nstrategy or market orientation of the firm, and the date the firm was established in its \nparticular setting. Our main independent variables are the USS, the country indicators, \nand the USS by Country interactions.  \n    Let us start by describing the results for the control variables. Firm size has a positive \nand relatively strong statistically significant effect on the use of calculative HRM-\npractices. This means that large firms use such practices to a greater extent than small \nfirms, controlling for the remaining variables in the model.  Among the industries only \nBanking and finance score significantly higher on the Calc scale than the reference \ncategory, Manufacturing. Firms with foreign markets and firms that are established the \nlast 20 years show more extensive use of calculative practices than firms with national \nmarkets and firms that are established before 1980. In total the controls explains about 9% \nof the variation in the Calc scale.  \n   The next group of variables in Table 3 are the main effects of the country indicators. \nSince the latter are also included in the USS by Country interaction terms, they must \nbe interpreted as the difference in the Calc score from the UK (the reference category) \nfor indigenous firms. Thus, the negative coefficients for Ireland, Denmark\/Norway \nand Germany indicate a less extensive use of calculative HRM-practices than in \nindigenous UK-firms. Indigenous firms in Denmark\/Norway score on the average \nabout 31 points lower on the Calc scale than indigenous UK-firms.  The positive \ncoefficient for Australia means that indigenous Australian firms score significantly \nhigher on the Calc scale than do indigenous UK firms. The multiple correlation \ncoefficients in the second panel of Table 2 show that the country indicators explain \nabout 20% of the variance that remains in the dependent variable after the control \nvariables were introduced in the first step. This is a further indication of rather \npronounced country differences in the use of calculative HRM-practices.                                      \n                 \n                                     ----------------------------- \n                                      Insert Table 3 about here \n                                   -------------------------------- \n  The last set of variables in Table 3 is the USS, which indicates whether the firm is a \nUS subsidiary or an indigenous firm, and the four design variables for the USS by \nCountry interaction. Three of the five variables in the set have statistically significant \neffects beyond the .05 level. The interaction terms for Germany and Australia are, \nhowever, not statistically significant at any conventional level. This means that the \nincrease in the use of calculative practices by US-owned firms in Germany and \nAustralia compared to indigenous firms is about the same in those two countries as in \nthe UK. To make for a more accessible interpretation of the results for the country \nindicators, the USS, and the interaction terms, the main results from the regression \nanalysis are displayed in a more intuitive way in Figure 1. This figure shows the \npredicted means on the Calc scale for the eight combinations of country and US \nownership, with control variables set to their means.    \n                                               ------------------------------ \n                                                 Insert Figure 1 about here \n                                               ------------------------------  \nThe white and dotted columns show the level of the use of calculative HRM-practices \nin indigenous firms in the five countries. Use of such practices is more common in the \nUK than in Ireland and Germany, and much more common in the UK than in \nDenmark\/Norway. Indigenous Australian firms do, however, exceed UK firms in the \nadoption of calculative HRM-practices. The dark striped columns show the use of the \nselected practices in US subsidiaries which is substantially lower in US subsidiaries \nlocated in Denmark\/Norway and Germany than in Ireland, the UK and Australia.  \n \nDiscussion \nOur overall proposition was informed by the national business systems approach \nimplying that foreign subsidiaries of MNCs will tend to adapt their managerial \npractices to the specific national, institutional conditions within which they operate.  \nWe have pursued this issue through a study of the degree to which national \nadaptations made by MNC subsidiaries reflect the degree of divergence between the \nnational subsidiary context and parent country institutional contexts. The analysis was \nfocussed on subsidiaries of US multinationals in four European settings as well as \nAustralia and to their application of three core calculative HRM practices. Clearly \nfuture research should extend our analysis both in terms of subsidiary nationality, host \ncountries and range of management practices. While mindful of these limitations it is \nreasonable to suggest that our findings are supportive of the overall proposition.  \n  The first hypothesis was the broadest of the three in the sense that it contrasted US \nsubsidiaries\u2019 use of these three HRM practices with the use of similar practices in \nindigenous firms in all of the five selected countries. This was supported by the \nempirical analysis hence indicating support also for the overall proposition concerning \nthe influence of national embeddedness of foreign subsidiaries of MNCs..   \n   Our second hypothesis was concerned with establishing that there are significant \ndifferences by country between indigenous firms in terms of the use they are \ninstitutionally able to make of calculative HRM. Our findings support the conception \nthat the UK and Australia represent amenable settings for calculative HRM.  \n   The third hypothesis focussed on the degree to which US subsidiaries adapt to the \nfive dissimilar national settings. The clearly lower means for US subsidiaries in \nDenmark\/Norway and Germany compared to US subsidiaries located in the UK, \nAustralia and Ireland indicate that US subsidiaries adapt to the local institutional \nsetting. Thus hypothesis 3 is also supported. The effect of being a US subsidiary is, \nhowever, not uniform for these two CME settings, in that it is larger for \nDenmark\/Norway than for Germany, possibly reflecting the less legalistic nature of \nthe Danish\/Norwegian setting. In line with our institutional analysis we can observe a \nsubstantial effect of being a US subsidiary in Ireland due to the dualistic nature of the \nIrish institutional setting. The use US subsidiaries are able to make of calculative \npractices in green-field Ireland is similar to that of the deregulated UK. This \ninstitutional latitude may represent at least a partial explanation of Ireland\u2019s and the \nUK\u2019s attractiveness as destinations for US foreign direct investment.  In regard to \nAustralia our findings indicate considerable use of calculative HRM practices by \nindigenous firms and even greater use by subsidiaries of US MNCs. Clearly the \nlegislative changes of the 1990s have created a very favourable setting for the \napplication of calculative HRM practices.  \n    Our findings also indicate that in regard to the indicators of a calculative HRM \napproach, US MNCs consistently diverge from their host country counterparts \nincluding the UK and Australia. As Ferner (2000) has surmised, this suggests that \nsubsidiaries of US MNCs to a significant extent attempt to take with them and apply \ntheir own, nationally idiosyncratic, repertoire of HRM practices to their subsidiaries in \nforeign countries. However, our results for Denmark\/Norway and Germany indicate \nthat they nevertheless experience constraints in doing this. Hence our findings \nillustrate the notion of \u201ctension\u201d that Kostova and Roth (2002) refer to, between the \nneed for local adaptation and global integration.  \n   The theoretical implication for our understanding of the transfer of management \npractices by MNCs is that, while rational explanations have some validity, they must \nsupplemented with institutional perspectives not least those contained in the national \nbusiness systems approach.  \n  Finally, it should be pointed out that this study has several limitations in regard to \naddressing the broad proposition that was our point of departure. One is that we have \nonly focussed on three HRM practices and further studies should attempt to analyse a \nwider array of such practices, for instance, the use of various forms of collaborative \npractices and \u201cwelfare capitalist\u201d social partnerships (cf. Gooderham et al., 1999; \nFerner, 2000). A number of other limitations to the study derive from the empirical \nstudy itself. First, the response rate in the Cranet survey was relatively low and this \nmay have introduced selection biases. Second, we have applied cross-sectional data \nthat make it impossible to distinguish the effects of diffusion of HRM practices on the \none hand and the potentially hampering effects of inert national institutions on the \nother. Doing this would require longitudinal data. Third, the application of certain \nHRM practices does not indicate whether these are actually used with the same degree \nof intensity or rigor in dissimilar settings.  \n  Fourth, our analysis is limited to US MNCs. Ferner (2000) has argued that due to the \nhegemonic position of the USA in the international economy and polity US MNCs are \nparticularly prone to presume the one-way-best superiority of the American model. In \nother words our findings may apply to a lesser degree to MNCs with other national \norigins. \n  It is, moreover, important to note that we have been not been preoccupied with \npossible effects of the selected HRM practices on firm performance. A crucial and \nunresolved issue relates to which types of HRM practices that contribute to increasing \nor decreasing organizational effectiveness and performance and under what \ncircumstances.   \n \nReferences \nAlbert, M., (1991).
