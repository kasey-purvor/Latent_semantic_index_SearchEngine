Phage mediated bacterial mortality has the potential to influence treatment\nperformance by controlling the abundance of key functional groups. Phage treatments have the\npotential to control environmental wastewater process problems such as: foaming in activated\nsludge plants; sludge dewaterability and digestibility; pathogenic bacteria; and to reduce\ncompetition between nuisance bacteria and functionally important microbial populations.\nSuccessful application of phage therapy to wastewater treatment does though require a fuller\nunderstanding of wastewater microbial community dynamics and interactions. Strategies to\ncounter host specificity and host cell resistance must also be developed, as should safety\nconsiderations regarding pathogen emergence through transduction.\nKEY WORDS\nBacteriophages; Wastewater; Sludge, Pathogens; Sludge Dewatering; Sludge Digestion.\n1. Introduction\nViruses are small infectious particles, typically 20-200 nm consisting of a nucleic acid core\n(single or double stranded RNA or DNA) enclosed by a protein coat (capsid) and in some cases a\nlipid envelope (Singleton and Sainsbury, 2002). Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect\nprokaryotes. Like all viruses, phages are obligate intracellular parasites, which have no intrinsic\nmetabolism and require the metabolic machinery of the host cell to support their reproduction.\n3Contact with the host cell occurs by passive diffusion. Phage adsorption and entry are mediated\nby specific receptors such as carbohydrates, proteins and lipopolysaccharides on the surface of\nthe host cell (Marks and Sharp, 2000). The specificity of interaction between phage attachment\nstructures and host\u2013cell surface receptors influences the bacterial host range. Host range is\ngenerally assumed to be narrow for aquatic phages (Alonso et al. 2002). However, broad host-\nrange (polyvalent) cyanophages are widely isolated (Suttle, 2000) and polyvalent phages have\nbeen isolated from sewage treatment plants (Jensen et al. 1998).\nTwo categories of bacteriophages are recognised; temperate and virulent. During lytic infection,\nvirulent phages inject their nucleic acid into the host cell following attachment. Expression of the\nphage genome directs the cellular machinery of the host to synthesise new phage capsule\nmaterial. The resulting phage progeny are released by fatal cell lysis enabling the lytic cycle to\ncontinue as new cells are infected. The number of progeny released (burst size) varies from 50-\n200 new phage particles (Wommack and Colwell, 2000). In contrast, during lysogenic infection\ntemperate phage nucleic acid recombines with the host cell genome forming a dormant prophage.\nThe prophage is reproduced in the host cell line and confers immunity from infection by the same\ntype of phage. Stress conditions such as ultraviolet light or chemical mutagens can induce a\nswitch to the lytic cycle (Jiang and Paul, 1998).\nBacteriophages are highly abundant in the aquatic environment ranging from 104 ml-1 to in excess\nof 108 ml-1 (Bergh et al. 1989). Numbers are typically 3-10 times greater than the bacterial\ncounts, although there is substantial variation between ecosystems (Weinbauer, 2003). A\nrelationship with bacterial numbers and activity implies that the majority of aquatic viruses may\nbe phages. Furthermore, numerous viral abundance studies show seasonal (Bergh et al. 1989;\n4Cochran and Paul, 1998; Hofer and Sommeruga, 2001) and diel variations (Jiang and Paul, 1994;\nWeinbauer et al. 1995), and are particularly responsive to plankton blooms (Bratbak et al. 1990;\nHennes and Simon, 1995). Wommack and Colwell (2000) summarised studies concluding that\naddition of concentrated viral particles tended to decrease bacterial populations by 20-40 %.\nConsequently, carbon transfer to higher organisms could be reduced thus influencing the entire\naquatic food web (Noble and Furhman, 1997). Furthermore, aquatic viruses may have a role in\ndetermining the diversity of bacterial communities through control of selected species competing\nfor resources (Hewson et al. 2003).\nIndeed, phage species richness is immense (Rohwer, 2003). Jiang et al. (2003) demonstrated that\nthe genetic diversity of marine bacteriophage is also substantially greater than that of host\nbacteria. Phages are subject to environmental constraints associated with aquatic ecosystems. For\nexample, Womack et al. (1999) and Weinbauer et al. (1995) observed that depth influenced\nmarine viral species distribution at Chesapeake Bay and in the northern Adriatic, respectively. In\ncontrast, phage distribution off the coast of Southern California did not appear to be limited by\nthe changing physical and chemical differences in the water column (Jiang et al. 2003). The\necology of prokaryotic viruses is reviewed in depth by Weinbauer (2003).\nSince their discovery by Twort (1915) and independently by d\u2019Herelle (1917), the bacteriocidal\nproperties of phage have raised interest in their potential use in the control of medical conditions.\nThe history of phage therapy is reviewed in depth by Chanishvilli et al. (2001) and Sulakvelidze\net al. (2001). In brief, phages were used widely in the early 20th century to treat human and\nanimal illness with varying degrees of success. In the West and US, research into phage therapy\ndeclined following inconsistent results and as a consequence of the discovery of antibiotics in the\n1940s. Phage therapy research continued in Eastern Europe where phage treatments against a\n5wide array of bacteria including staphylococci, pseudomonads, Proteus spp. and enteric\npathogens were produced (Weber-Dabrowska et al. 2000; Chanishvilli et al. 2001). There has\nbeen a renewed interest in phage therapy over the past two decades, partly as a consequence of\nincreasing antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Much recent work has focussed on animals as models\nfor human infection or veterinary applications (Smith and Huggins 1987; Biswas et al. 2002;\nHuff et al. 2002; Matsuzaki et al. 2003).\nAcknowlegement of the importance of bacteriophages in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems\n(Weinbauer, 2003) has led to interest in wider environmental applications. The potential of\nphages to control bacterial infections in cultured fish (Nakai et al. 1999; Nakai and Park, 2002),\nin plants (Flaherty et al. 2000) and to control cyanobacterial blooms (Mole et al. 1997) have been\nstudied. Schuch et al. (2002) reported on the isolation of a phage enzyme capable of lysing the\nbiological warfare bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. Commercial production of a phage to kill E.\ncoli O157:H7 in manure and to remove pathogens from carcasses and food preparation areas is\nalready underway (Thiel, 2004). There is also the potential to use phage techniques to influence\nwastewater treatment. This is discussed further in this review together with the occurrence of\nphage in wastewater treatment and possible treatment limitations.\n2. Occurrence of Bacteriophages in Wastewater Treatment Plants\nMany studies report applications of bacteriophages as indicators or tracers for presence of\nbacteria in wastewater treatment systems. Nevertheless, their role in the microbial communities\nof wastewater treatment systems is poorly understood. Early studies (Dias and Bhat, 1965)\nindicated that E. coli phages (coliphage) were not functional in laboratory scale activated sludge\nsystems. Within two hours of aeration coliphage abundance declined 10-fold from 2460 PFU ml-1\n6to 230 PFU ml-1, stabilising thereafter for a further 23 hours. Coliphages, infectious for\nEnterobacteria present in wastewater, are removed during activated sludge treatment (Bitton,\n1999). However, coliform bacteria comprise only a small component of activated sludge\nmicroflora (Ewert and Paynter, 1980; Hantula et al. 1991). Little is known about the\nbacteriophages which infect the dominant, viable and functionally important components of the\ncommunity. The few studies available to date, suggest that phages may be active components of\nactivated sludge systems (Dias and Bhat, 1965; Ewert and Paynter, 1980; Hantula et al. 1999;\nHertwig et al. 1999; Khan et al. 2002a and b; Thomas et al. 2002). Ewert & Paynter (1980)\nreported an increase in total phage concentration during an activated sludge process, suggesting\nactive replication was occurring via host infection and lysis. Maximum phage concentrations in\nreactor mixed liquors (9.5 \u00d7107 ml-1) were significantly higher than concentrations in influent\nsewage (2.2 \u00d7 107 ml-1). Ewert and Paynter (1980) noted that direct electron microscopy detected\nhigher phage titres than by plaque assays highlighting that studies employing plaque assays to\nquantify the specific phage titres of the host used may not reflect the overall dynamics of the total\nphage population. Hantula et al. (1991) also demonstrated the presence of active phage-host\nrelationships in activated sludge. The authors identified 49 indigenous phage-host systems,\nreporting high individual titres (up to 5 \u00d7 104 PFU ml-1) which fluctuated indicating phage\nactivity during the 5 week study period. In contrast, coliphage concentrations (<60 PFU ml-1)\nwere frequently below detection limits. Bacteriophages infectious for some of the functionally\nimportant bacteria in wastewater treatment plants have also been isolated. Khan et al. (2002b)\nisolated three phages from laboratory scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR)\nreactors, which were infectious for Brevibacterium epidermidis and linens and Rhodococcus\nerythropolis. Phages appear to be active components of activated sludge systems and phage-\nmediated bacterial mortality has the potential to influence treatment performance by controlling\nthe abundance of key functional groups.\n7A number of activated sludge treatment processes including phosphorus removal and nitrification\nare known to be unstable. Nitrification, (the microbial oxidation of ammoniacal nitrogen via\nnitrite to nitrate) can be a difficult process to maintain in activated sludge nutrient removal\nsystems (Wanner et al. 2000). Due to the slow growth rate of nitrifying bacteria, effective\nnitrification requires a high sludge age in order to prevent biomass washout and wastage. Poor\nnitrification rates have been attributed to low specific activities of nitrifiers as a consequence of\ntoxic inhibition by chemicals or ammonia in the influent wastewater (Burgess et al. 2002).\nInhibition often occurs in wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) receiving high strength\nmanufacturing and industrial wastewaters. However, nitrification failure has also been attributed\nto a low concentration or even absence of the nitrifying bacteria (Wanner et al. 2000). It is\npossible that low abundances of nitrifying bacteria could be the result of lytic infection by\nbacteriophages.\nThe impact of bacteriophages in WwTWs anaerobic digesters is unknown but it is likely that they\ndo play a role in controlling strain composition and abundance. Studies employing laboratory\nanaerobic digesters have revealed rapid shifts in microbial composition (Zumstein et al. 2000;\nCasserly and Erijman, 2003). Continuous, long-term evolution of the anaerobic community, with\nsuccessive shifts in the dominance of at least eight species, was not related to abiotic factors such\nas pH, temperature and feed composition, which all remained constant; internal biotic factors\nsuch as phage-host cycles and predation by protozoa were suggested as the causal agents for\nshifts in community structure (Zumstein et al. 2000).\n3. Potential Phage Treatments\n83.1 Pathogen Control\nSludge produced by biological wastewater treatment processes contains a diverse array of\npathogenic bacteria, viruses, protozoan and metazoan parasites. In excess of 1 million and 6.8\nmillion tonnes of dry sludge (DS) are produced annually in the UK and US respectively\n(DEFRA, 2002; Hettenbach et al. 1998). The beneficial reuse of this sludge by application to\nagricultural land is generally regarded as the best practical environmental option. The EU does\nnot currently impose numerical standards for pathogen levels in sludge recycled to land.\nHowever, as a result of recent public concern over recycled sewage sludge, as a vector for the\ntransmission of human diseases, revisions to guidelines in the UK have been proposed (DEFRA,\n2002). Two categories of sludge product have been identified with specifications for\nmicrobiological standards. Conventionally treated sludge must attain a minimum 2 log reduction\nof E. coli abundance across the treatment process and a final product standard with a maximum\nadmissible concentration (MAC) of 1 x 105 CFU g-1 DS E. coli. Treatment processes producing\nenhanced treated sludge must achieve a minimum 6 log reduction in E. coli abundance during\ntreatment and a final end product with a MAC of 1 x 103 CFU g-1 DS E. coli and zero Salmonella\nin 2 g DS. US EPA regulations are similarly categorised in to Class A and Class B sludges. Class\nA pathogen reduction requirements are more stringent than those of class B sludges which are\nsubject to application restrictions. Class A sludges are required to reduce pathogens to below the\ndetectable limit (< 3 MPN Salmonella, < 1 PFU enteric viruses and < 1 viable helminth ovum per\n4g DS). Treatment processes designed to achieve the pathogen reduction can incur substantial\ncapital and operating costs.\nDevelopment of phage treatment of sludge may provide long term and cost effective control of\npotentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g. E. coli and Salmonella). Successful phage treatment of\nwastewater bacterial pathogens would be dependent on the prevalence and diversity of pathogen\n9species within wastewater. It would be virtually impossible to produce phage targeted at all\npathogenic serotypes. For example, there is a high diversity of E. coli serotypes (Singleton and\nSainsbury, 2002) and around 2400 known Salmonella serotypes exist (Popoff and LeMinor,\n1992). However, wastewater treatment conditions intrinsically reduce the numbers of some\npathogenic bacteria. Therefore, there is potential for phage treatment to be used successfully in\ncombination with biological sludge stabilisation processes to reduce the abundance of specific\npathogenic bacterial strains such as E. coli O157. Indeed, research into phage therapy for\nreduction of this pathogen in animal reservoirs is already underway (Bach et al. 2003).\n3.2 Improving Dewaterability\nSludge dewatering is an important process in wastewater sludge treatment with sludge volume\nreduction promoting savings in equipment capacity as well as downstream treatment costs.\nMicrobial exopolysaccharide (EPS) is responsible for binding microbial cells and particulate\nmatter together (Wingender et al. 1999), thus influencing formation, settling and water binding\nability of activated sludge flocs (Bura et al. 1998). High levels of microbial EPS, which can\ncontain up to 99 % water by weight (Costerton et al. 1981), can inhibit the dewaterability of\nwaste activated sludge (WAS) (Kang et al. 1989; Sanin and Vesilind, 1994) and anaerobically\ndigested sludge (Houghton and Stephenson, 2002). Excessive production of EPS by species such\nas Zoogloea and Thauera, which form zoogleal clusters or flocs, has been implicated in\ndewatering problems of WAS. Lajoie et al. (2000) observed a negative correlation between\nabundance of zoogleal clusters and dewaterability.\nBacteriophages carry polysaccharide depolymerase enzymes (PDE) (Adams and Park, 1956)\nwhich are secreted during attachment of phage to the bacterial host. The enzymes degrade the\nbacterial exopolysaccharide capsule (secondary receptor) allowing the phage to bind to primary\n10\nreceptor sites in the outer membrane (Hughes et al. 1998). This characteristic has attracted\ninterest in their application for control of biofilm formation (Tait et al. 2002). Doolittle et al.\n(1995) observed lytic infection of E. coli biofilms by phage T4 (a well-studied member of the\nlytic T-even phages) and Skillman et al. (1999) utilised phage PDE to specifically denature\nEnterobacter agglomerans. Hanlon et al. (2001) demonstrated the ability of bacteriophages to\ndiffuse through commercial alginate gels and purified Pseudomonas aeruginosa EPS. Phage\ntreatment reduced the viscosity of commercial alginate gels by up to 40 % compared to controls,\nwhile application of phage to intact P. aeruginosa biofilms at a ratio of 1000 : 1 (phage :\nbacteria) resulted in a 99 % reduction in cell density. Alginate degradation may be attributed to\nboth the presence of phage-borne enzymes and the release of bacterial alginate depolymerise\nenzymes following cell lysis. Similarly, Hughes et al. (1998) showed that Enterobacter\nagglomerans bacteriophage SF153b isolated from sewage and applied to E. agglomerans 53b\nbiofilms degraded the EPS matrix and subsequently lysed infected cells.\nApplication of bacteriophages which selectively target strains such as Zoogloea and Thauera,\ncould provide additional benefits in reducing EPS levels and improving sludge dewaterability.\nEnzyme treatments have already been shown to improve sludge dewaterability by the hydrolysis\nof water binding polymers (Thomas et al. 1993) and phage-borne polysaccharide enzymes have\nthe potential to be exploited for similar purposes.\nUnfortunately, phage treatment of biofilms and flocs is not without its constraints. The complex\nfloc architecture may serve as a refuge habitat inhibiting the delivery of phage to target cells;\nbacterial cells situated within intact biofilms have been shown to be less amenable to infection\nthan suspended cells (Hanlon et al. 2001). In addition, phage-borne depolymerase enzyme\nspecificity is high (Reiger-Hug and Stirm, 1981) and minor changes in EPS structure and\n11\ncomposition may render the glycocalyx unsusceptible to depolymerase attack. Hanlon et al.\n(2001) reported that degradation of commercial alginate was phage specific. Escherichia coli\nphage Lambda and staphylococcal bacteriophage failed to reduce gel viscosity in contrast to P.\naeruginosa phage GL1. Similarly, the high specificity of phage SF153b glycanase to E.\nagglomerans prevented the degradation of Serratia marescens EPS (Hughes et al. 1998). The\nprobability of isolating a phage which bears an enzyme specific to the bacterial EPS (secondary\nreceptor) and which, is capable of infection by the primary receptor, may be low (Lindberg,\n1977). Mixed species flocs would contain a complex mixture of EPS from a range of bacterial\nspecies. The efficacy of phage treatment of multi \u2013 species biofilms has not received a great deal\nof attention (Tait et al. 2002).\nWastewater treatment systems are thought to contain from 17 to 268 different bacterial species\n(Wagner and Loy, 2002). However, a range of diversity surveys analysing more than 750 16S\nrRNA sequences have revealed that these communities tend to be dominated by the \u03b2 \u2013, \u03b1 \u2013 and \u03b3 \n\u2013 Proteobacteria (Juretschko et al. 2002; Wagner and Loy, 2002) (Figure 1). Fluorescent in-situ\nhybridisation (FISH) studies have indicated that a small number of species dominate the\nmicroflora. For example, Juretschko et al. (2002) reported that operational taxonomic units\nrelated to Z. ramigera and the close relatives Azoarcus and Thauera comprised 17 % and 16 % of\nall detectable cells in activated sludge from an industrial wastewater treatment plant. Similar\nlevels of abundance (up to 10 %) were reported for Zoogloea ramigera by Rossello\u2013Mora et al.\n(1995) while Lu et al. (2001) found slightly lower concentrations of Z. ramigera in mixed liquor\nsupernatant (4.2 \u00d7104 MPN ml-1) and solids (2 \u00d7107 MPN g-1) representing 5.9 % and 1.5 % of\nthe total abundance of aerobic bacteria respectively. It is apparent that a small number of\nbacterial species dominate floc microflora and hence the contribution to EPS. Thus, despite high\n12\nbacterial diversity, it is possible that only a small number of different phage species would be\nrequired for efficient degradation of EPS.\n3.3 Improving Digestibility\nMunicipal wastewaters generated in the UK and Europe are commonly treated by conventional\nactivated sludge processes. This involves the removal and transformation of organic pollutants in\nwastewater into cellular biomass, carbon dioxide and water by an aerobic microbial community\n(Weemaes and Verstraete, 1998). Assimilation efficiencies for aerobic microorganisms are high\n(Mayhew and Stephenson, 1997) resulting in the production of excess biological sludge (e.g.\nWAS). The subsequent processing of which is an important and complex problem.\nAnaerobic digestion, of WAS with primary sludge, has traditionally been used to stabilise sludge\nand reduce odour emissions and pathogens. In addition, the reduction in sludge volume reduces\npost-digestion processing, transport and re-use costs, while energy can be recovered in the form\nof methane. In the UK, mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAnD), is the most common sludge\nstabilisation process with 54 % of UK sludge treated in this manner (Gendebien et al. 1999).\nUnfortunately however, WAS can be difficult to digest because the organic material is largely\ncompartmentalised within microbial cells resistant to lysis (Weemaes and Verstraete, 1998).\nWAS may contain up to 70 % bacterial biomass (Lehne et al. 2001) and the hydrolysis and\nsolubilisation of these residual cells is considered to be the rate limiting step of anaerobic\ndigestion (Eastman and Ferguson, 1981; Gujer and Zehnder, 1983).\nThe problem of poor WAS digestibility has received a great deal of attention in recent years. A\nwide range of treatments have been examined for their potential to improve WAS digestibility\n13\nduring MAnD (Muller, 2001). Digestibility has been improved by mechanical (Dohanyos et al.\n2000; Winter, 2002), thermal (Li and Noike, 1992; Kepp et al. 2000), chemical (Ray et al. 1990;\nLin et al. 1997) and ultrasonic (Rooksby et al. 2002) pre-treatments. In all cases the treatments\nare designed to disintegrate microbial cells and convert high molecular weight refractory organic\nmaterial to low molecular weight biodegradable components prior to their reduction in sludge\ndigestion.\nSimilarly, phage mediated cell lysis could be developed as a pre-treatment for WAS to aid\nanaerobic digestion. There is potential for targeted phage treatment to simultaneously aid\ndewaterability and digestibility of WAS. Phages, infectious for numerically dominant strains in\nactivated sludge such as Zoogloea, Azoarcus, Thauera and Sphaerotilus, could be used to lyse a\nsignificant proportion of the bacterial biomass, enhancing substrate availability to the anaerobic\nmicroflora during MAnD. Microbial community structure varies considerably between\nwastewater treatment plants and such disparity could hinder the development of generalised\nphage treatments for improving digestibility, necessitating tailor \u2013 made treatments for different\nplants.\nAnother potential application of phage in anaerobic digestion is the control of sulphate reducing\nbacteria (SRB). The presence of oxidised sulphur compounds in wastewater promotes growth of\nspecies such as Desulfovibrio and Desulfosarcina during sludge stabilisation by anaerobic\ndigestion. SRB can compete against acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic\narchaea for substrates (Kalyuzhnyi and Fedorovich, 1998), thus affecting degradation processes\nand leading to reduced methane yields (O\u2019Flaherty et al. 1998; Ranade et al. 1999). Furthermore,\nthe associated sulphide production contributes to corrosion and odour problems and can lead to\nprecipitation of trace metals (Stephenson et al. 1994). Thus, inoculation with lytic phage targeted\n14\ntowards SRB genera (which comprise up to 20 % of the anaerobic reactor total cell count -\nMerkel et al. 1999), may aid control of nuisance microbes in digestion degradation processes.\n3.4 Control of filamentous bacteria in activated sludge\nSettlement of sludge formed during activated sludge processes is essential if clean effluents are to\nbe produced. Bulking and foaming of activated sludge due to the over proliferation of\nfilamentous bacteria is a common operational problem in many nutrient removal plants (Mamais\net al. 1998; Madoni et al. 2000). The filamentous bacteria responsible include the genera\nMicrothrix, Gordona, Nocardia, Corynebacteria, Dietzia, Rhodococcus and Skermania (Soddell,\n1999). The filamentous flocs formed have high surface area: mass ratios producing poor sludge\nsettling properties, which result in bulking. In addition, hydrophobic cell surfaces (Lemmer,\n1986) and the production of extracellular polymers (Khan and Forster, 1988) promote the\nstabilisation of bubbles (air, water and microbial cells), which cause foaming. Subsequent\npollution of the clarifier effluent with suspended solids has a negative impact on plant\nproductivity and efficiency.\nVarious methods have been developed to maintain the correct balance between floc forming\nbacteria and the filamentous microorganisms responsible for solids separation problems.\nHowever, none of the existing methods are totally adequate. Disinfection can result in the\nmortality of important functional groups such as the nitrifiers, while the efficacy of selectors has\nbeen mixed (Eikelboom, 1994; Davoli et al. 2002; Martins et al. 2004).\nRecently, Thomas et al. (2002) highlighted the potential for bacteriophages to control foam\nformation in activated sludge plants. From six activated sludge samples, the authors isolated 17\nphages (primarily Siphoviridae) capable of lysing foam-forming bacteria. Host range studies\n15\nwere carried out on 47 species from the genera Dietzia (1), Gordonia (8), Mycobacterium (4),\nNocardia (14), Rhodococcus (16), Skermania (1), Streptomyces (1), Tsukamurella (1) and a\nsuspected new genus (1). Fifteen phages were found to be polyvalent with varying spectra of\ngenera and species lysed. Twelve isolates showed broad host ranges and were infectious for two\nor three of the genera Nocardia, Gordonia and Rhodococcus, however, none were able to lyse all\nmembers of one genus. None of the phages were able to lyse certain hosts (Dietzia, Skermania,\nStreptomyces and the suspected new genus). It is evident from this study that a large reservoir of\npolyvalent phages may exist. With further research, this pool could potentially be exploited to\nprovide an effective long-term control of bulking and foaming problems.\n3.5 Control of non-phosphate accumulating bacteria\nBiological phosphate removal by phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) is widely used to\nprevent eutrophication in aquatic systems receiving treated effluent. Anaerobic-aerobic reactor\nconfigurations (enhanced biological phosphate removal or EBPR systems) are designed to select\nfor PAOs. During the anaerobic phase, PAOs degrade polyphosphate and take up carbon sources\nfrom influent wastewater, releasing orthophosphate which is then re-absorbed during subsequent\naerobic growth. Phosphate is removed from the system through discharge of excess sludge (Mino\net al. 1998). However, some non-PAO organotrophic (\u2018G\u2019) bacteria can compete under anaerobic\nconditions (Cech and Hartman, 1993; Wanner et al. 2000). They obtain energy for substrate\nuptake through glycogen catabolism rather than by hydrolysis of polyphosphate (Satoh et al.\n1994). The dominance of \u2018G\u2019 bacteria is believed to be responsible for process failure in EBPR\nsystems (Wanner et al. 2000; Whang and Park, 2002).\nIt may be possible to target phage treatment towards bacteria which out-compete PAOs. The\nexact strains responsible for treatment failure have not been identified and \u2018G\u2019 bacteria appear to\n16\nbe phylogenetically diverse (Kong et al. 2002). Amaricoccus species were thought to be\nimplicated in process failure (Maszenan et al. 1998) but subsequent reports have shown that\nalthough abundant in EPBRs, pure cultures did not display the metabolic characteristics\ndescribed above (Kong et al. 2002). If \u2018G\u2019 bacteria responsible for EBPR failure can be\nidentified, selective targeting of those species with lytic bacteriophages has the potential to\nselectively reduce interspecific competition contributing to the long term stability of EBPR\nprocesses.\n4. Limitations to Phage Treatments\nGeneral limitations to phage treatment have been addressed in a number of reviews (e.g. Barrow\nand Soothill, 1997; Sulakvelidze et al. 2001; Duckworth and Gulig 2002). However, many of\nthese are not relevant to the use of phage in WwTWs. This review lists potential limitations for\napplications in wastewater treatment in Table 1, with some limitations outlined in more detail in\nthe following section.\n4.1 Host Specificity\nThe WwTW operator must identify which phage preparation to add to address a specific process\nfailure or limitation. Microbial analysis of the system microflora is likely to be required because\ncommunity structure can vary substantially between wastewater treatment plants. Manz et al.\n(1994) used subclass specific probes to demonstrate differences in the community structure\nbetween municipal and dairy waste activated sludge plants. Dairy waste batch reactor samples\nwere dominated by cells which hybridised with a cytophaga-flavobacterium-specific probe but in\ncontrast, municipal sewage was dominated by \u00df-proteobacteria. To date, studies of community\nstructure using culture-independent molecular techniques have provided snapshots of microbial\ncomposition in wastewater treatment plants. Temporal changes in community structure are\n17\npoorly understood and may form an obstacle to the successful application of strain specific\nphages.\nWhen target bacteria have been identified, phage infective for those species must then be\nselected. Host specificity is central to selection of suitable phage for particular WwTW\napplications. Narrow host specificity was implicated in the failure of some early phage treatments\n(Sulakvelidze et al. 2001). More recent attempts to control meat spoilage using phages lytic for\nPseudomonas strains were also unsuccessful, with only 57.2 % of the 1023 strains isolated from\nbeef being phage sensitive (Greer and Dilts, 1990). This study highlights the potential\nimpracticality of attempting to develop phage treatments for generalised or broad-spectrum\ncontrol of bacterial populations.\nIn contrast, although most phages in aquatic environments are thought to have highly specific\nhost ranges (Wommack and Colwell, 2000), theory might suggest otherwise. In diverse microbial\ncommunities, where each species is present at low abundance, polyvalent phages would be\nexpected to be at a competitive advantage relative to highly specific phages (Wilkinson, 2001).\nContact by random diffusion is much more likely to result in successful infection and lifecycle\nclosure if the phages show relaxed receptor specificity. A number of workers have isolated\npolyvalent bacteriophages from sewage. Of six Yersinia ruckeri phages isolated by Stevenson\nand Airdrie (1984), all but one lysed over 50 % of 49 Y. ruckeri strains from four serovars. All\nsix phages lysed 13-100 % of eight Y. enterocolitica strains and 26-57 % of a range of 27 species\nfrom other bacterial genera. Hantula et al. (1991) found that approximately 10 % of phages\nisolated from activated sludge were polyvalent and suggested that broad host ranges may be\ncommon in natural systems. Later, Jensen et al. (1998) reported that 90 % of bacteriophages from\ncollections isolated from freshwater and sewage were polyvalent. For example, bacteriophage\n18\nSN-T was capable of lysing members of six genera including strains of Pseudomonas,\nEscherichia, Proteus and Shigella. More recently, Thomas et al. (2002) found that 15 out of 17\nphages isolated from activated sludge had broad host ranges (section 3.4). Khan et al. (2002a)\ndemonstrated that all eight phages they isolated from activated sludge were polyvalent and 50 %\nformed plaques on both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. It has been suggested that\nobserved narrow host-specificity may be an artefact of phage enrichment and isolation techniques\n(Jensen et al. 1998). To minimise modifications to phage during enrichment, it would be prudent\nto explore multiple host isolation techniques vs. single host methods.\nPhages used therapeutically have traditionally been thought to exhibit a narrow host range. If this\nis true of phages associated with wastewater bacteria, the potential of phage treatments is more\nlikely to lie in selective targeting of particular problematic strains (Hughes et al. 1998). If (as\nstudies described above suggest) polyvalency is prevalent among wastewater phages, there may\nbe potential for their use in ameliorating problems caused by a range of different bacterial species\nand strains. Despite the potential advantages of polyvalent phages, broader host range could lead\nto phage influencing not only the target strains, but also beneficial degradative bacteria. Further\nresearch to determine the true extent of polyvalency of wastewater and activated sludge phages\nwould undoubtedly aid their use in wastewater treatment.\n4.2 Phage isolation and production\nIt is essential for the success of any phage therapy that suitable phage can be both isolated and\nenriched to produce sufficient numbers for the application. Phage enrichment typically involves\nthe inoculation of mixed environmental samples and growth media with a single host strain.\nFollowing overnight incubation, the bacteriophages produced by lytic infection of the host are\ndetected by plaque assay on lawns of the original isolation host. This relies on the ability to\n19\nisolate a suitable host bacterium which may not be straight forward given that only 1-20 % of\nbacteria in the environment are culturable in vitro (Andreotola et al. 2002). However, advances\nin culturability have occurred in the last few years (Connon and Giovannoni, 2002; Rappe et al.\n2002; O\u2019Sullivan et al. 2004). Repeated phage purification using just one host strain may\nincrease specificity for that strain potentially narrowing the host-range of the phage. Jensen et al.\n(1998) found that phages fell into two groups according to isolation method. Where a single host\nbacterium (Sphaerotilus natans) was used during isolation, phages displayed a similar efficiency\nof plating (EOP) on both the isolation host and an alternative host (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). In\naddition, phage DNA was insensitive to type II endonucleases. Where a multiple host isolation\ntechnique was employed (E. coli plus Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Sphaerotilus natans), EOP\nwas lower on the alternative host than the isolation host and phage DNA was sensitive to both\ntype I and II restriction endonucleases. Since DNA from phage isolated on a single host did not\nprevent cleaveage of phage lambda DNA, it appears that modifications to the viral DNA were\nresponsible for the insensitivity to restriction enzymes. The authors argued that multiple-host\nisolation techniques may be more effective at isolating polyvalent phages by avoiding the\nselection bias of single host methods.\nSuccessful application of phage to WwTWs is likely to require addition of high concentrations of\nphage because of the potentially large volume of wastewater to be inoculated. Large scale\nproduction of phages was carried out between 1950 and 1970 (Marks and Sharp, 2000). Sergeant\nand Yeo (1966) produced E. coli phage \u03bc2 at concentrations above 1013 PFU cm-3 in 150 L tanks\nwhich equated to 75 mg phage per L culture. The authors found that the optimum time for phage\naddition to the bacterial host cultures was that which allowed lysis to take place just before CO2\nevolution reached maximum levels. Increasing aeration also improved yields. Previous studies\n20\nyielded up to 200 mg L-1 of phages MS2 and T2 respectively, at smaller culture volumes (Seigel\nand Singer, 1953; Strauss and Sinsheimer, 1963).\n4.3 Host Resistance\nIt is evident through chemostat studies that bacteria can rapidly become resistant to phage\ninfection (Fuhrman, 1999). A stable equilibrium is reached where most bacteria are resistant to\ntheir co-occurring phages and only a small phage-sensitive host pool remains (Lenski, 1987). It\nhas been theorised that the metabolic cost of resistance gives sensitive strains a competitive\ngrowth advantage or that low abundance reduces risk of phage-host contact (Gill and Nealson,\n1972; Chao et al. 1977). Through chemostat studies, Lenski and Levin (1985) concluded that,\nwhile the evolution of a phage resistant host strain was inevitable, emergence of new phage\nvariants which exploit different receptor sites to counter resistance, was rare.\nEvidence of host resistance in activated sludge is contradictory. Ewert & Paynter (1980)\nobserved phage-sensitivity in only three out of 48 (unidentified) dominant bacterial isolates from\nmixed liquor and sewage and Hantula et al. (1991) observed approximately 15 % sensitivity in\nactivated sludge isolates. In contrast, Khan et al. (2002a) reported that 60 % of bacterial isolates\nfrom activated sludge were phage sensitive. Fuhrman (1999) suggested that phage resistance in\nbacterial hosts may not be prevalent in aquatic ecosystems, particularly where oligotrophic\nconditions prevail. Middelboe et al. (2001) used a modelling approach to predict that in a mixed\nbacterial culture, host cell resistance would develop following infection and lysis of the dominant\nbacterial strain. They hypothesised that viral lysis would only have temporary effects upon total\nand strain-specific bacterial abundances as the proportion of resistant clones would increase and\nreplace the sensitive population. They also predicted, however, that non-specific protozoal\ngrazing (which is prevalent in wastewater treatment systems) may allow for recovery of sensitive\n21\nhost populations. This is thought to be due to the reduced fitness of resistant bacteria in\ncomparison to sensitive bacteria which results in faster recovery and multiplication of sensitive\npopulations after grazing. This is corroborated by Simek et al. (2001) who recorded increased\nviral infection of reservoir bacteria as a consequence of flagellate grazing. The problem of\nresistance is likely to complicate the development of potential phage treatments. However, it has\nbeen observed that numerous phage species can infect a single bacterial strain (e.g. Wolf et al.\n2003). There is potential to exploit this phenomenon to counter development of resistance.\n4.4 Decay and loss of infectivity\nViral decay and loss of infectivity may reduce the efficacy of phage treatment of wastewater.\nStudies of coliphage fate have demonstrated a reduction in viral particles during wastewater\ntreatment (Tanji et al. 2002a and b), although this is perhaps not surprising since coliform\nbacteria do not feature strongly in the active microflora of WwTWs (Fig. 1; Ewert and Paynter,\n1980; Hantula et al. 1991). Removal of viruses during activated sludge treatment occurs by viral\nadsorption to sludge flocs (Wellings et al. 1976; Tanji et al. 2002b) and more than 97 % of\ncoliphages may be associated with suspended particles (Ketratanakul and Ohgaki, 1989), which\nare transferred to sludge during settlement. Poor phage penetration into sludge flocs may\ntherefore limit phage treatment efficacy as phage die-off may occur before contact with the host\ncell is made (section 3.2). The importance of phage penetration of flocs is currently unclear.\nIngestion of viral particles by bacteria, protozoa and metazoa may also contribute to phage loss in\ntreatment systems (Kim and Unno, 1996). Environmental stresses, particularly solar radiation and\nstarvation, may also promote reduction in phage numbers (Wommack et al. 1996; Davies-Colley\net al. 1999) and have deleterious effects on phage replication (Kokjohn et al. 1994). In WwTWs,\npenetration of sunlight is likely to be limited by turbidity, and oligotrophic conditions are\n22\nunlikely to occur. Hantula et al. (1991), however, reported low in-situ infectivity in activated\nsludge samples, with phage titre rising to maximal abundance several weeks following their\ninitial emergence. Since the precise generation times and densities of the hosts were unknown,\nslow infection may have been a result of either slow absorption kinetics or slow host lifecycles.\nThus, inactivation or loss of introduced bacteriophages may be exacerbated by low in vivo\ninfectivity.\nInsufficient host cell concentration may also contribute to phage decline, particularly in the case\nof pathogens, where the target bacterium, e.g. enterohaermorrhagic E. coli (Grant et al. 1996) are\nnot among the dominant species of the wastewater or sludge. Payne and Jansen (2001) developed\na model to predict the outcome of phage treatments on the basis of replication and density-\ndependent properties of phage-host interactions. Major factors identified which could determine\nthe outcome of phage treatment included: (i) whether the concentration of phage in the inoculum\nexceeded a threshold level sufficient to cause net reduction in bacterial numbers without\nsubsequent replication (inundation); (ii) whether the phage inoculum exceeded a bacterial\nclearance threshold and could bring about complete clearance of the bacteria by inundation and\n(iii) whether phage could persist long enough to undergo active replication (active therapy -\ndependent on timing of inoculation and bacterial numbers exceeding a threshold level sufficient\nto allow proliferation). Temporal changes in the abundance of target bacterial populations are\ninherently likely. Such shifts in population abundance as a consequence of changing\nenvironmental conditions, in addition to competition, predation and development of host\nresistance within the treatment system should be taken into account in order to optimise the\nphage treatment strategy. Payne and Jansen (2001) suggested that for successful treatment, phage\ninoculation should coincide with a bacterial population density sufficient to support phage\nreplication. Based on this approach, there are two potential treatment strategies for wastewater:\n23\n1) Application of high concentrations of phage as an inundative treatment to ensure a rapid\n\u2018passive\u2019 kill by primary infection of target bacteria; or 2) Low-level application of phages for\nlong-term control of target populations where continuous removal is sustained by actively\nreplicating phage populations. Continuous active therapy would be dependent on the bacterial\nconcentration in the treatment system, but the exact threshold required to sustain active phage\npopulations is not clearly understood. Wiggins and Alexander (1985) observed three phage-host\nsystems in vitro: 80\uf061-S. aureus, SP\uf062 cI-Bacillus subtilis and T4-E. coli. The authors observed\nthat minimum bacterial densities of 1 \u2013 1.5 \uf0b4 104 CFU ml-1, 3 \uf0b4 104 CFU ml-1 and 7 \uf0b4 103 CFU\nml-1 respectively were required before phage replication occurred. Studies of phages in natural\nsystems have also suggested the presence of such a proliferation threshold. Suttle and Chan\n(1994) found that when marine Synechococcus concentrations exceeded 103 CFU ml-1, the\nabundance of co \u2013 occurring cyanophages increased substantially, indicating active phage\nreplication above a critical host abundance. In contrast, Kokjohn et al. (1991) demonstrated that\nP. aeruginosa bacteriophages could replicate at low host cell densities (102 ml-1) in vitro.\nRecently, Kasman et al. (2002) argued that there is no replication threshold of host cells per se,\nindependent of the phage population and adsorption constant. Rather, the rate of infection is\nentirely dependent on the host cell density in accordance with the theoretical kinetics of colloidal\nparticles subject to Brownian motion.\nIf indeed a threshold host level for replication exists, in activated sludge systems total bacterial\ncell densities exceed 109 CFU ml-1. Likely target strains in WwTWs occur at cell densities in the\nregion of 4 \uf0b4 104 MPN ml-1 for Zoogloea ramigera (Juretschko et al. 2002) and for Sphaerotilus\nnatans and relatives of the \uf062-Proteobacteria at approximately 3 \uf0b4108 MPN ml-1 (Snaidr et al.\n1997).\n24\nDensity of non-host cells may also be important in determining the success of phage treatment of\nwastewater. Wilkinson (2001) highlighted competitive hindrance by non-host species as a barrier\nto the success of phage treatments. In diverse and densely populated ecosystems including\nactivated sludge and biofilms, non-host strains behave as \u2018decoys\u2019. Phage particles collide and\nadsorb briefly to non-host cells thus inhibiting phage contact and lytic infection of the host strain.\nThis could further explain low infection rates in activated sludge communities observed by\nHantula et al. (1991). It may also be theorised that highly specific phages will be at a competitive\ndisadvantage to polyvalent phages. The overall ecosystem effect of decoy hindrance is to dampen\nthe classic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey oscillations, preventing near extinction of the host\nspecies (Wilkinson, 2001). Clearly, the presence of decoys in the diverse communities of\ntreatment systems may hinder the success of phage treatments.\nContinuous loss of phages in WwTWs may mandate frequent re-application while low infectivity\ncould constrain the practicality of some phage treatments if prolonged treatment and\nconsequently storage times are required.\n4.5 Transduction\nHorizontal transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells can occur through temperate\ntransducing phages. Transduction arises when host DNA is mistakenly packaged into the phage\ncapsid during production of the viral progeny (Wommack and Colwell, 2000). Progeny adsorb\nand introduce genetic material into new recipient cells. Infection does not give rise to lysis\nbecause the phage particles do not contain the complete phage genome required for replication.\nBacterial virulence factors are frequently encoded by bacteriophages, which can confer virulence\nby transduction (Saunders et al. 2001). For example, the conversion of non-pathogenic E. coli\n25\nstrains to enterohaemorrhagic strains through phage-mediated transfer of Shiga toxin genes (Stx I\nand II) has been demonstrated (Muniesa et al. 2000; M\u00fcller et al. 2002). Phages encoding the Stx\nII gene and which are infectious for E. coli 0157: H7 are abundant in raw (influent) urban sewage\n(Muniesa and Jofre, 1998; Muniesa and Jofre, 2000). Their importance in the horizontal transfer\nof Stx II genes among enterobacteriaceae in sewage is unknown. However, generalised\ntransduction by broad host-range phages isolated from sewage has been demonstrated (Jensen et\nal. 1998). Bacteriophage SN-T and SN-1 lysates produced by infection of phototrophic P.\naeruginosa PAO1 were capable of inducing arginine auxotrophy in P. aeruginosa PAO303\nfollowing infection. The authors highlighted the potential role of polyvalent bacteriophages in\ndissemination of genetic information between a diverse range of host species. Similarly, Hertwig\net al. (1999) demonstrated that mixed Yersinia bacteriophages isolated from raw sewage were\ncapable of the generalised transduction of small (4.3 and 5.8 kb) plasmids isolated from non \u2013\npathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains. However, the Yersinia phages were incapable of transducing\nlarger (72 kb) virulence plasmids from pathogenic Y. enterocolitica to benign strains. In this case\nthe phage particles (40-60 kb) were probably not large enough to package the virulence plasmid.\nBacteriophage therapy requires rapid lysis of host cells thus temperate phage are generally not\nselected. However, little is known about the biology of phages associated with many WwTWs\nbacteria and demonstrating the inability of a phage to increase bacterial virulence is not easy. It\nwould be preferable to avoid phages capable of lysogeny or with genetic material consistent with\nability to display lysogeny (Goodridge and Abedon, 2003). Horizontal transfer of virulence\ndeterminants may result in the emergence of new pathogens with obvious associated health\nimplications, thus assessing sensitivity of non-target organisms to phage may be important,\nparticularly if phage targets are pathogenic bacteria.\n26\nMolecular biology may provide long-term solutions to many of the potential limitations of\nwastewater applications of phages. For example, genetic modifications to alter host specificity\ncould abate some of the barriers to phage applications in WwTWs, however, further research and\nrisk assessments would be required before use of engineered phage could be implemented for\nwastewater treatment.\n5. Discussion\nThe re-awakening of interest in the use of phages to control bacterial infections has spread from\nthe medical sector laterally into the fields of agriculture, aquaculture and the food industry. Non-\nclinical applications of phage therapy have raised interest in their potential for control of\nwastewater treatment processes. Indeed, Thomas et al. (2002) have already begun investigations\ninto phage biocontrol in wastewater treatment and this review has highlighted aspects of\nwastewater treatment where phage-induced bacterial lysis might be harnessed in order to deliver\nimprovements in sludge dewaterability and digestibility, to control foaming and to control levels\nof specific bacterial pathogens.\nIt remains to be seen whether phages also have the potential to be used to optimise wastewater\ntreatment processes. Through long-term phage-mediated control of the microbial composition of\ntreatment systems, it may be possible to alleviate problems such as competition between\nglycogen and polyphosphate accumulating bacteria in activated sludge systems and between\nsulphate reducing bacteria and acidogenic, acetogenic and methanogenic microbes in anaerobic\ndigestion units.\n27\nThere are significant barriers to the use of phage therapy in control of wastewater treatment\nsystems, not least the paucity of understanding of microbial community dynamics and\ninteractions during wastewater treatment. Success would also depend on accurate identification\nof problem bacteria, effective isolation and unbiased enrichment of phage and the ability of\nphage to penetrate flocs and remain infective in-situ. Strategies to counter host cell resistance\nmust also be developed. Furthermore, safety considerations, such as risk of pathogen emergence\nthrough transduction must be assessed as should cost-benefit and reliability of treatments. Thus,\nsubstantial research is required before phage therapy can be applied successfully to WwTWs.\nThe application of phage therapy to wastewater treatment systems undoubtedly requires a more\ncomplete understanding of the microbiology of wastewater and aquatic habitats in general. Until\nthis is achieved, many potential phage treatments will remain speculative. Indeed, failure to\nundertake research in this area will not only delay the development of beneficial applications of\nphage, but will also limit our knowledge of a component of modern microbiology critical to our\nunderstanding of bacterial pathogenesis and ecology. Current public perception regards phages in\na positive light, particularly as an ally against bioterrorism and disease (Thiel, 2004), which\nalready overcomes one important barrier to their use.\nDespite some of the potential hinderances to the development of phage treatments for the\nwastewater industry, successful studies in other fields indicate that phage therapy deserves\nattention. With a greater understanding of the microbial ecology of wastewater treatment\nsystems, phage treatments may become effective solutions to wastewater treatment problems and\noptimisation.\nReferences\n28\nAdams M H and Park B H.
