For the large amount of digital images avail-\nable on the web this becomes challenging because the tags are abstract\nconcepts whose relationship is undefined. For effective search which re-\nquires reasoning on concepts and their relations one requires richer data\nstructures for tagging and one needs to take into account the confidence\nand credibility of the tagging user. In this paper, we introduce a novel col-\nlaborative framework for image annotation, which allows users to create\ntags that are based on a concept repository which provides a hierarchi-\ncal context for them as well as allowing to define relationships among\nsaid concepts. It also provides a new and systematic way to establish\nuser credibility as well as to compute the truthfulness or reliability of a\nparticular statement, which are used for ranking search results. A proto-\ntype has been implemented using this approach and we will show some\nexamples to explain our methodology in detail.\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years the number of images available online has increased significantly\nleading to a problem of \u201cinformation overload\u201d in the sense that finding what one\nis looking for becomes hard. Tagging or annotating has become a popular way of\nadding searchable information to images, especially in shared environments such\nas social networking websites. An image tag is a small piece of plain text or some\nkeywords attached to a specific area of an image. It helps users in organising and\nsearching image content. However, it raises a challenging question about how to\nstructure metadata to enable users to describe, extract and search information\nbased on images in a more accurate and efficient way.\nCurrently there are a number of tagging approaches available. Generally these\nare based on keywords, but there have also been some efforts centered around\nontologies. We will now highlight some problems of the keyword-based tagging\napproaches and some known issues existing in semantic-oriented tagging frame-\nworks [8]. Keyword-based tagging approaches have the following drawbacks:\nAmbiguous semantics. In traditional image tagging system, a tag is normally\na freely-chosen, non-hierarchical keyword or term. The tag in several pictures\n? This work was partially supported by Leverhulme Trust Funded \u201cTracing Networks\u201d\nProgramme.\n2can be identical but the meaning maybe ambiguous. For example, plain text\n\u201cdate\u201d tagged on an image might have different interpretation. It may refer\nto a day on the calendar, a fruit or the image is showing someone out on a\ndate. Because the word has several meanings and the context of its use is\nnot mentioned it is unclear what is meant. Similarly, a system is unable to\ntell whether the picture with tag \u201cmouse\u201d is referring to a computing device\nor an animal, something totally different.\nInadequate support for describing relationships. Current tagging sys-\ntems are focused on labelling elements in the picture rather than the rela-\ntionships among them, but in the real world specifying relationships between\nentities is as important as identifying the entities themselves. For example,\na user can select two tagging areas on the image and annotates them with\n\u201ccat\u201d and \u201cmouse\u201d, but most annotation systems do not provide enough\nsupport to describe the relationship between them in a formal way e.g. \u201cthe\ncat is chasing the mouse\u201d (but not \u201cthe mouse is chasing the cat\u201d, or even\n\u201cthe cat is sleeping near a [computer] mouse\u201d).\nAbility to perform automatic reasoning. Unstructured plain text tags do\nnot allow to perform any reasoning tasks along with the search. For example,\ngiven a query \u201cdisplay all images with two animals on it\u201d, the system will not\nbe able to answer this question because it does not have sufficient knowledge\nto reason about the facts, such as e.g. cats and mice being in fact animals.\nDue to the previous point there can also not be any reasoning for searching\nfor pictures where for example \u201cmice are chasing cats\u201d.\nTo overcome the limitation of traditional tagging approaches, semantic tag-\nging applications have been developed e.g. [11]. These are also not perfect:\nMaintaining domain-specific ontology without domain experts. Many\nof these systems are developed specifically for a particular domain (e.g.\nMedicine, Bioinformatics etc.) and are normally implemented on the basis\nof a domain-specific ontology. Although these ontologies provide a formal\nknowledge representation as a set of concepts and relationships within this\nparticular domain which fits and works quite well, the ontologies need to be\nmaintained by domain experts in collaboration with ontology developers.\nLong-term maintenance may become an issue.\nDescribing truthfulness and reliability of a statement. Current seman-\ntic tagging applications do not have the functionality to say how truthful\nor reliable user\u2019s statement is. The system does not support statements such\nas \u201cI have strong evidence to believe that there is a cat in the tagging area\u201d\nor \u201cIt is probably a cat in the picture, but I am not sure about it\u201d, nor a\nway to express these in any other form.\nMeasuring user credibility in collaborative environment. Most collabo-\nrative image tagging applications do not take into account the trustworthi-\nness of a statement and the reputation of a user based on their expertise.\nE.g. Alex is a zoologist and she believes the animal in the picture is a house\ncat without a doubt while a 5 year old child tagged it as a lion. The trust-\nworthiness of the opinion or statement should be determined by both the\n3credibility of a user in a certain field along with how certain they are in\nmaking the judgement.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel collaborative framework for image anno-\ntation, which allows users to create tags that are based on a concept repository\nwhich provides a hierarchical context for them as well as allowing to define re-\nlationships among said concepts. It also provides a new and systematic way to\nestablish user credibility as well as to compute the truthfulness or reliability of\na particular statement, which are used for ranking search results.\nThe next section will introduce the framework, section 3 will look at the im-\nplementation and evaluation. Section 4 shows related work and section 5 com-\npletes the paper with conclusions and an outlook to future work.\n2 Collaborative Image Annotation and Search Framework\nWe propose a framework for image annotation and search in collaborative work-\ning environments to address the problems listed above. The framework is built on\nthe basis of an Image Annotation Ontology, which functions as an abstract data\nmodel for organising and storing tagging data. It provides the infrastructure for\nannotators to link a tag to the predefined concept within a conceptual-semantic\nlexical database. This forms our knowledge base, therefore a reasoner can be used\nto exploit implicit knowledge as the tagging data are structured in a machine\nreadable and understandable way. The tagging framework also allows users to\ndefine the degree of uncertainty of a statement. This is called certainty factor\nand will subsequently be used in conjunction with user credibility to compute\nthe truthfulness of statements. This additional user context will greatly improve\nthe efficiency and accuracy of a query. We will illustrate the main components\nand steps with a few examples in the following sections.\n2.1 Data Model\nTo allow for reasoning and structuring the tagging information an underlying\nstructure is needed. The basic structure of the Image Annotation Ontology is\nshown in Fig. 1. This structure allows to store information about a tagging area\nfrom the image and the relevant annotations as in conventional image tagging\nsystem. In addition to that, assumptions concerning a subject-predicate-object\ntriple or a link between tagged area and resources can be stored. Every assump-\ntion is associated with an original certainty factor given by the annotator. Each\nindividual user is assigned a set of credibility values for the different domains in\nwhich they annotate according to their expertise and reputation in that domain.\nResources are a group of synonyms defined in the WordNet lexical database,\norganised into hierarchies by hypernym (or hyponyms). A hypernym is referred\nas an \u201cis a\u201d relationship, for example the phrase airplane is a craft can be used to\ndescribe the hyponymic relationship between airplane and craft. The WordNet\nhierarchy for the word \u201caircraft\u201d [16] is shown in Table 1.\nWhile linking a tagging area to a term defined within WordNet, the definition\nof the term as well as the whole branch of the hypernym tree describing the\n4Fig. 1. Image Annotation Ontology Overview\nTable 1. hypernym, hypernyms and synonyms of \u201caircraft\u201d in WordNet\nairplane, aeroplane, plane\nheavier-than-air_craft\naircraft\ncraft\nvehicle\nconveyance, transport\ninstrumentality, instrumentation\nartifact, artefact\n..........\nsemantic relations between these nodes, will be added to the triple store to\npopulate the knowledge base. A user is free to create new terms by adding a\nnew branch to the tree. A new term is fully defined as long as all leaf nodes in\nits branch are linked to already predefined terms.\nUsing WordNet provides us with an ontology that is not domain specific,\nbut rather generic and that is maintained in a collaborative fashion. In addition\nit is not specific to our application and hence maintenance becomes a property\nsomewhat distant from our immediate concerns.\n2.2 Uncertainty in Trusted-Triple Graph\nThe subject-predicate-object relation mentioned in the previous section is com-\nmon to ontologies and the usual structure used for storage is a Triple Graph.\nWe are proposing an extension to Triple graphs to include a certainty factor\n(cF)[10] which is a number from -1.0 to 1.0 indicating how accurate or certain a\nuser is about an assumption. Positive certainty means the user basically believes\nthe assumption is a true statement, but he or she is possibly not 100% certain.\nNegative certainty means a disagreement with a given assumption, but might\nnot rule out the possibility. For example, a statement such as \u201cThe blonde girl\nwearing the blue T-shirt is Alice\u201d might be given a number such as 0.95 from a\nfriend of hers; who would be reasonably certain of the fact. But if you had never\nmet Alice, but heard that she is an Asian girl then you will probably give a\n5Fig. 2. An example of user\u2019s opinion on a statement\nnegative certainty number, say -0.7 as generally Asians are not blonde. Assume\ncF (u, s) is the original certainty factor given by a user u for assumption s. To\ncombine the certainty factor and user reputation we define the concept of a com-\nposite user certainty-credibility factor CF (u, s, rd) applying to an assumption s\nmade by a user u with reputation r in a domain d. CF is defined as follows:\nCF (u, s, rd) = rd \u00b7 CF (u, s) (1)\nwhere s is a subject-predicate-object triple or an assumption about the relation-\nship between tagging area and a predefined concept, CF (u, s) is the certainty\nfactor given by user u on s, and rd is the user\u2019s reputation r in domain d.\nWe will come back in section 2.3 to explain how rd is calculated. To com-\npute the overall certainty-credibility factor CFs based on all available judge-\nments of all users (e.g. u1, u2 ) over the same statement s, we combine CF1 =\nCF (u1, s, rd1) and CF2 = CF (u2, s, rd2) using the parallel function [10] in (2):\nCFs =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nCF1+CF2(1-CF1) , if CF1, CF2 \u2265 0,\nCF1+CF2(1+CF1) , if CF1, CF2 < 0\nCF1 + CF2\n1\u2212min(|CF1| , |CF2)|), other\n(2)\nFor example, consider the statement \u201ca cat is chasing a mouse\u201d shown in\nFigure 1. For CF1 = 0.8 and CF2 = 0.7, we have CF = 0.8+0.7\u00b7(1\u22120.8) = 0.94.\nIn this case, the overall composite user certainty-credibility factor is 0.94,\nsignificantly above the average of the individual users\u2019 claims, which might come\nas a surprise. There is a certain sense in this: if many user\u2019s tend to claim the\nsame thing with reasonable confidence then one can overall be more confident in\nit actually being true and the effect of people being \u2018shy\u2019 in claiming certainty\nbecomes reduced. However, it also stops us from arguing that the a statement\nis \u2018twice as true\u2019 as another just because it has double the score.\n2.3 User Credibility Extraction\nWe need to obtain the reputation [9] r of a user to calculate the user certainty-\ncredibility factor. The expertise factor [7] defines the degree of a user\u2019s compe-\ntency to provide an accurate prediction in a particular field. In our case, the\nreputation r of a user u in a domain d, it is defined by (3)\nr(u, d) = \u03b2(u, d)\n(\n1\u2212 \u03a3s\u2208D(s)\u03a3a\u2208U(s) |CF (u, s)\u2212 CF (a, s)||D(s)|\n)\n(3)\n6where CF (u, s) is the original certainty factor given by user u on s, U(s) is\na set of users who commented on statement s (excluding user u), D(s) is the\nstatement set in the domain of target statements s, and \u03b2(u, c) is the activity\nweighting and is defined as 1\u2212 (1\/n) (n is the number of comments within this\ncategory), meaning that a user will be assigned a higher value of expertise if\nmaking more comments for more statements within a particular category1.\nNote that we refer to r(u, d) as rd if it is clear which user is concerned.\nAs can be seen in formula (3), the reputation of an annotator is determined\nby several aspects. In general, (a) the more statements in the same category a\nuser commented the more likely are they to have specific expertise in the field and\nthis will increase their reputation in this category, but only if (b) the opinions\nthe user provided reflect the truthfulness of the actual statement as measured\nby the similarity between their judgement and judgements made by other users.\nFor example, our zoologist Alex commented on a lot of pictures regarding\nwildlife and her judgement is quite accurate in most cases, so normally her\nopinion in this domain does not differ much from the general public including\nother zoologists. Also, the annotations she created about wildlife were generally\naccepted by the community. In this case, Alex should have a hight reputation in\nthe wildlife domain. While (say) a computer scientist called Tom also made lots\nof comments on wildlife, but his opinions received negative feedback; therefore\nhe is less credible than Alex in this domain.\n2.4 Query and Reasoning\nSo far we have presented how image information is enhanced with semantic\ndata and other aspects. This is the preparation for successful searches. The\nAnnotation Ontology model we used for structuring the tagging data and user\ncontext makes it possible for the system to run intelligent queries in conjunction\nwith a reasoning component. Queries can be defined by graph patterns rather\nthan simple keywords. It allows for more flexible ways of obtaining answers for\nqueries. A modified version of our example in the introduction could be:\n\u201cDisplay all images with two animals in them, along with what is happening\nbetween them\u201d\nA specific variant of that query might be \u2018find all pictures where mice are\nchasing cats\u2019. This query is concerned with entities and their relationships in\nthe picture. Our trusted-triple repository, which is built on top of the Image\nAnnotation Ontology, contains the information about the tagged areas and their\nrelationships. It also contains the hypernym hierarchy (e.g. the fact that a cat is\nan animal) derived from the WordNet database. In other words, the background\nknowledge we need to answer this query is already captured by the data model.\nApart from this, we will need a set of inferencing rules to perform the reasoning.\nTo formulate the questions in a formal way, we rewrite it as listed below.\n1 Bear with us! We are not claiming that just because someone makes lots of comments\nthey are more qualified to do so.\n7Ask for: ?a1 ?relation ?a2\nImage(?i),appearsOn(?a1,?i),appearsOn(?a2,?i)\nAnimal(?a1),Animal(?a2),?relation(?a1,?a2)\nThis query will have to be run together with several deductive reasoning\nrules (rules of the form \u201cantecedents \u2192 consequent\u201d), to get the search results.\nExamples of these are:\nMouse(?a),hyponymOf(Mouse, Animal)-> Animal(?a)\nCat(?a),hyponymOf(Cat, Animal)-> Animal(?a)\nClearly if one had to specify all of these this would not be sensible. However,\nthe reasoning rules can be rewritten in a more generic and reusable form. The\nrelation \u201chyponymOf\u201d is a transitive property and the second rule will compute\nthe transitive closure over the relation \u201chyponymOf\u201d.\nConcept(?c1),Concept(?c2),?c1(?x),hyponymOf(?c1, ?c2)-> ?c2(?x)\nhyponymOf(?c1,?c2),hyponymOf(?c2,?c3)->hyponymOf(?c1,?c3)\nThe query and inference rules are in fact graph patterns and they can be\ntranslated to SPARQL [2] queries and SWRL [3] rules. Though unbounded pred-\nicate support (such as ?relation) is currently not available in many rule-based\nquery languages such as SQWRL [13], we can still translate it to SPARQL-DL.\nIn addition to this, as we are using a trusted triple graph, we can also carry\nthe information on uncertainty through the reasoning by attaching a certainty\nfactor to each custom reasoning rule as suggested in [10].\n2.5 Ranking\nOnce the search results are obtained they are ranked by the degree of truthful-\nness. This is calculated for every sub graph in the result set that matched the\npattern. The weight of the subgraph is defined by the function:\nWG =\n\u220f\ns\u2208T\nCFs (4)\nwhere G is a trusted subgraph matching the search pattern, T contains all triples\nin G, and CFs is the overall composite certainty-credibility factor of triple s.\nWG will then be used in the ORDER BY clause of the concrete query im-\nplementation providing a result set with the most trusted results at the top.\n3 Implementation and Evaluation\nA web-based prototype application has been implemented in Java. Figure 4\nillustrates the architecture of the system, which consists of several parts. A web-\nbased annotation interface allows users to annotate the image. An annotator\ncan describe concepts and relationships in the image by constructing a set of\ntrusted triple statements, with help of an extendable WordNet lexical database\n8Fig. 3. Screenshow of the prototype implementation\nand a remote OpenCalais[1] service. WordNet groups the synonymous words,\nprovides precise definition of terms and defines the semantic relation between\nthese synonym sets. It works in conjunction with the OpenCalais service to help\nuser identify the possible topics (category or domain) of an image. Besides, an\nannotator can also specify the degree of certainty about an assumption. A screen-\nshot of the interface is shown in Fig. 3. For every triple statement, the overall\nuser certainty and credibility factor will be computed by a certainty calculator\nand a user credibility calculator respectively; these will then be combined into\nthe composite user certainty-credibility factor used for ranking search results.\nThe query engine retrieves annotation data from the trusted triple repository\nby means of SPARQL queries and a native OWL API. The system also utilises\nboth description logics (DL) and deductive rule-based reasoning for inferencing.\nThe search screen is currently simply a textbox that allows entry of a query and\nthe results show a ranked list of images that match the given query \u2013 both not\nvery exciting to look at in a screenshot.\nWe are evaluating our approach with users from the archaeology community.\n\u201cTracing Networks: Craft Traditions in the Ancient Mediterranean and Beyond\u201d\n[4] is a joint archaeological research programme, which involves archaeologists\nand Computer Science researchers. This research programme investigates the\nnetwork of contacts across and beyond the Mediterranean region, between the\nlate Bronze Age and the late classical period (1500-200 BCE). Researchers in\ndifferent sub-projects have already gathered massive amounts of image resources\nand cross-team knowledge sharing and analysis are vital \u2013 and being able to\nretrieve the right pictures is essential. The intention is to apply the presented\n9Fig. 4. System architecture overview\napproach to enhance the collaboration of teams and enable future research by\nothers.\n4 Related Work\nVarious approaches and techniques for tagging have been proposed by differ-\nent research groups in the last few years, especially to identifying the vocab-\nulary such as folksonomies [15]. A survey of approaches for various semantic\nannotation techniques is presented in [14]. We have already in the introduction\nsummarised the shortcoming of these works. Many other existing collaborative\nsemantic tagging systems such as SemKey make use of external resources such\nas WordNet in their approaches [12, 6]. However, most available systems and\nframeworks are more focused on metadata modelling, concept identification and\nrelationship extraction instead of representing uncertainty, user credibility and\ntaking into account all these factors for reasoning and searching. The closest\neffort on uncertainty is the W3C Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide\nWeb Incubator Group (URW3-XG), which proposed an Uncertainty Ontology\nin their report in 2008 [5]; however their focus is more defining the data structure\nto hold uncertainty information than on its calculation and use.\n5 Conclusion & Future Plan\nIn this paper, we identified problems and limitations of available tagging sys-\ntems and proposed a framework for image annotation and search in a collabo-\nrative environment. We developed an ontology-based data model for identifying\nconcepts, relationships and storing context regarding users. The WordNet lexi-\ncal database, which describes the semantic relations betweens different terms is\nused to disambiguate the keywords and populate the knowledge base. We also\n10\nintroduced a systematic way to represent uncertainty of a statement as well as\nuser credibility measurement; these two factors are combined into a composite\nuncertainty-credibility factor, which is used for ranking the search results. We\nexplained with examples how rule-based reasoning can be used in conjunction\nwith graph patterns to help us answer advanced queries. Finally, we presented\na prototype implementation that illustrates our methodology.\nWe are currently looking into several areas of future work, such as (1) evalu-\nating the approach with a variety of users from different communities, (2) con-\nsidering a more complex user context to provide a more context-aware search\nand (3) an evaluation of how these factors affect search results and ranking.\nReferences\n1.
