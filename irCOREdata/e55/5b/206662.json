Admittedly, we now like to dignify what \nthe Classical thinkers from Plato to Hegel did with the grand title of philosophy in order \nto distinguish it from what Brian Barry, Quentin Skinner, Isaiah Berlin do. But despite \nthe best efforts of generations of political philosophers, there is no uncontroversial \ndistinction between political philosophy and political theory. Indeed it is best to see the \ndistinction as an institutional one: political philosophers are political theorists employed \nby Philosophy departments and political theorists are political philosophers employed \nwithin Government or Political Science departments. Any other attempt to identify the \ndifference in terms of first and second order levels of inquiry begs the question \nconcerning the nature of the activity itself. If we go back to the greats of the past, they \nare surprisingly laid back about the issue \u2013 with the possible exception of Plato who \nthought being a philosopher was the only relevant qualification for political rule. Instead \nwe find a complex of levels of inquiry, causal explanations, historical interpretations and \nmoral recommendations. It is this plurality and complexity that make the greats from \nPlato the Hegel, Marx and Mill still so rewarding. What it does not help with is \nidentifying what political theory is about and what it is for once we have a more \nsophisticated disciplinary identity. As the subject emerged in Britain in the last 150 years \nthe role and nature of political theory - as distinct from a coherent and incrementally \naccumulating body of knowledge such as political science aspires to be - becomes both \nmore confusing and more central to the preoccupations of political theorists. Unlike \npolitical scientists who argue about method but are still primarily concerned with data \n 2 \ncollection, analysis and hypothesis testing, political theorists seem to be consumed with \nthe nature of their activity and how it connects to political science. This nervousness of \npurpose is partly because many of the dominant paradigms of U.S. political science, \nwhich cast their long shadow over the political studies community in Britain throughout \nthe last sixty years, have been profoundly sceptical about the role and value of political \ntheory especially where it makes normative claims. But normativity is not the only \nproblem. As other areas of political science develop they identify a clear object of enquiry \nsuch as a country specialism, or else elections, party competition, executive and legislative \npolitics or public policy analysis. At best political theorists can specialise in a thinker or a \nperiod \u2013 such as Bentham and utilitarianism (my own modest claim to fame). This of \ncourse makes us look remarkably like historians: scholars who are concerned with the \nthinkers or the politics of the past. Many political theorists have embraced the historian\u2019s \nchallenge (associated with the late nineteenth century Cambridge legal scholar F.W. \nMaitland that political science is history \u2018or it is humbug\u2019) and identify themselves as \nhistorians. This, in my view regrettable development, has been exacerbated by the \nCambridge Trinity of John Pocock, John Dunn and Quentin Skinner. The so-called \nCambridge school has had a hugely negative impact on the study of political thinkers \nfrom the past by rendering it either of merely antiquarian interest or frivolous. Although \nthey would reject this characterisation of their impact, at least two of the Cambridge \ntrinity (Skinner and Dunn) acknowledge the main the thrust of the charge and do make \nsubtle uses of past thinkers for thinking about politics more generally in a less antiquarian \nfashion.1 Their attempt to disconnect reflection on past political thinkers from reflection \non politics and its languages, styles and limitations has left political theory with a greater \nsense of disconnection from the wider activity of political science. Some have sought to \nrescue themselves from this lack of purpose by turning to a new normative agenda \nfocused on issues of social or distributive justice. Certainly under the huge influence of \n 3 \nJohn Rawls a whole generation of normative \u2018political philosophers\u2019 has arisen who are \ninterested in the real philosophical issues of fairness, justice and rights, and who pride \nthemselves on their ignorance of past political thought, an ignorance that is definitely not \nshared by some of their heroes such as Rawls himself or Brian Barry in the UK. I am \ninclined to endorse this change of direction, but as will become clear later, I would like to \nargue that it is the approach and methods and not the substantive questions that are \nprimarily important if political theory is not to find a new redundancy in the continual \nspinning of ever more similar theories of distributive justice.  Before turning to this \nmanifesto for a viable future for political theory, I want to make one critical swipe at an \nunfortunate tendency in much contemporary British political theory. \n \nBreaking the spell of the \u2018giants\u2019 \n \nIt is not uncommon to find British scholars who lament the dominance of Rawls and \nAmerican rights-based conceptions of politics on British political thought and theory.2 \nYet British political thoughts seems to be equally dominated by the long shadows of \nMichael Oakeshott and Isaiah Berlin. Both modern gurus had a huge impact on the \nshaping of a generation of British political theorists and they still exercise that influence \non a current generation from beyond the grave.  Indeed many of those who lament the \nbaleful influence of Rawls are only too happy to rely on the authority of Oakeshott or \nBerlin, as if where a guru comes from is the only issue, and being influenced by Rawls is \nshowing a distinct lack of patriotism.  \n \nOakeshott and Berlin are important thinkers, but they are also the source of some \nunfortunate and damaging trends in contemporary political thought. Both were writing at \na time of rapid professionalisation in the study of politics in the United Kingdom as new \n 4 \ndepartments were established and as those departments began to carve a distinctive \nconception of what the study of politics should be. They also wrote in the shadow of \nlogical positivism and the rise of ordinary language philosophy3 from the 1930s until the \nlate 1960s and derived from that a scepticism about the prospects and authority of \npolitical theory as an activity. Both saw the role of philosophy as a diminishing one and \nby turning the insights of ordinary language philosophy back against the great tradition of \npolitical theory they inadvertently cleared the ground for a more positivistic conception \nof political science. This was certainly not their overt intention, as their defenders will be \nonly too quick to argue, but their impact, despite the veneration in which they are held by \nmany, has been hugely detrimental to the subsequent development of political theory.  \nOakeshott bequeathed to his successors the concept of \u2018the rationalist\u2019 which they are \ndetermined to apply to anyone who attempts to engage in normative theorising or who \nsupported the Labour party pre Tony Blair. To be a \u2018rationalist\u2019 is to be a \u2018system crazed\u2019 \nplanner, but it appears that everyone from Auguste Comte to contemporary theorists of \njustice are \u2018rationalists\u2019. Rationalists confuse the contingencies of the present for some \ntimeless philosophical insight into reality and end up causing chaos. There is obviously a \nkernel of truth in Oakeshott\u2019s characterisation and a salutary warning, but the concept is \nso broad it allows for no subtle distinctions nor for philosophical insights into how good \nnormative theorising is distinguished from bad. All normative theorising is dismissed as a \ncategory mistake, but one that depends on a stipulative and controversial account of \nphilosophy and politics. Of course Oakshottian anti-rationalism is itself a kind of \nrationalism, and as it was used by many of his followers it became a rationalism of the \nright. But from our perspective, its real danger was that it served as a smokescreen for \nclosing down argument and debates. Many of the next generation of theorists inspired by \nOakeshott have attempted to bring his ideas to bear on contemporary debates by \n 5 \nfocusing on his theory of civil association, but that delivers little that can engage with the \nconcerns of political scientists.4  \n \nBerlin has less of an overt theory than Oakeshott: his turn to political theory or \nphilosophy resulted in a series of loose historical reflections on the great thinkers of the \npast. Perhaps his greatest essay \u2018Two Concepts of Liberty\u2019 (1958), is an account of two \nhistorical traditions masquerading as conceptual analysis, or vice versa! Whatever, personal \nintegrity and warmth Berlin brought to his teaching, in terms of a viable continuing \nresearch project there is precious little. This has not stopped a whole industry growing up \naround Berlin as one of the most profound theorists of liberalism in a world of plural \nvalues. A quick trawl through the journal literature will demonstrate just how pervasive is \nBerlin\u2019s influence. Yet apart from an assertion of the \u2018plurality of values\u2019 it is hard to find \nmuch by way of a theory or even an indication of the direction in which we might search \nfor a theory. Once we start to interrogate the idea of value pluralism, incommensurabilty \nand negative liberty we soon find that Berlin is left well behind.  \n \nWhereas Oakeshott encourages a supercilious rejection of the aspirations of political \nscience and theory, Berlin embodies a kind of quaint dilettantism, which suggests that \nserious intellectual inquiry and something called \u2018research\u2019 is actually rather vulgar. Of \ncourse, I am caricaturing both thinkers, but only to bring out the negative impact both \nhave had on the character of political theory in Britain.  \n \nA contemporary of Oakeshott and Berlin, who casts a much shorter shadow, but whose \nreal importance deserves greater attention is H.L.A. Hart. Although a Professor of \njurisprudence, his impact on the development of analytical and normative political theory \nis considerable and hugely overlooked. I have no doubt that when proper historical \n 6 \nperspective can be achieved, scholars of the future will acknowledge Hart as one of the \ngiant figures of political philosophy in Britain, someone whose made possible the \nreception of such path-breaking books as Brian Barry\u2019s Political Argument (1965) and \nprepared the way for Rawls A Theory of Justice in 1972. This is not merely to paint Hart \nas a John the Baptist to Rawls, but to acknowledge that Hart is one of the very few \nmodern philosophers that Rawls deferred to in the way in which he does to greats such \nas Hume, Kant, Rousseau and Sidgwick. Hart\u2019s rigorous argumentation and analytical \nsubtlety is a model for later political philosophy. Also important is he preparedness to \ndraw on law, sociology and other disciplines to make progress in political philosophy.  \nWhat defines the subject of political philosophy is not some narrow concept of the \npolitical but a conception of analytical rigour and intellectual broadmindedness. He also \nrecognised that good political theory cannot be wholly divorced from a sense of the past \nor the insights and resources that past thinkers provide us for making sense of the \nproblems of the present.  His work on Bentham is a model of how to read a past political \nthinker seriously, critically and insightfully. \n \nAgainst normalisation \n \nMany of those who would describe themselves as modern political philosophers will find \nmuch in Hart that resonates with their own concerns. What they might fail to recognise \nthe extent to which they have narrowed the scope of political theory to speculation \ncentred on the concept of justice. This is the so-called baleful influence of Rawls: the \ncreation of a generation of scholars who think that the problem of justice exhausts the \nscope of political theory.5 The predicament of modern political theory is not uncommon \nin a world in which normalisation is seen as a mark of disciplinary authority. \nNormalisation involves the establishment of paradigmatic problems that give a central \n 7 \ncoherence to any discipline. Much science operates within the paradigm of the normal, \nand involves small incremental gains in knowledge. Political theory seems to be \npreoccupied with distributive justice and \u2018problems from Rawls\u2019 and has used these as \nthe basis for its claim to have an unfolding research agenda. To an extent, it is perfectly \ntrue that the problem of justice does open up a research agenda as we can see from the \nrecent proliferation of hyphenated conceptions of justice; environmental justice, global \njustice, intergenerational justice, multicultural justice and so on, as well as continuing \ndebates between feminists, libertarians, Marxists, and multiculturalists about the \nfoundations of justice.  \n \nNormalisation is certainly appropriate in other areas of political science, and it is perhaps \nthe recognition of this that creates the desire for normalisation in political theory. But \nthis tendency remains, for all that, inappropriate in the case of political theory. Political \ntheory does not have a single determinate focus in the way that electoral systems, EU \npolitics or international political economy does. This may be a weakness in the eyes of \nthose who want political science to become more like a natural science, but it remains the \ncase that political theory derives much of its interest and excitement from the fact that it \ndoes not have a single paradigmatic problem and stable set of normal problems to be \nsubject to technical solution.  \n \nSo whilst the turn to social justice has been enormously fruitful in forcing political \ntheorists to reflect on the nature and possibilities of their activity as much as on \nquestions of \u2018who gets what, where, when and how\u2019, much of that achievement is easily \ndissipated if theorists try to close down the scope of political theory by confining to a \nsingle set of questions. Indeed, focusing on one set of questions also arbitrarily separates \nconcepts, so we see the discussion of justice divorced from questions of democracy, \n 8 \npower, the state and violence, as well as each of these additional concepts divorced from \neach other. \n \nIn the end what makes political theory interesting to many of those who practice it, is \nprecisely the absence of a single determinate object of enquiry. Political theory and \npolitical theorists like to see themselves as the conscience of the discipline of political \nscience by asking tough questions of the narrow scope of the concept of the political that \nthe normal procedures of academic enquiry impose. The nature and site of politics is \nalways ambiguous \u2013 this is not to deny that some sites like the state are more important \nthan others \u2013 and it is the task of political theory to continually challenge attempts to \ndelimit the scope of political enquiry and reflection. \n \nAgainst gibberish  \n \nThe conception of political theory outlined above suggests a form of enquiry that is \nconstantly challenging attempts to fix its attention on a particular set of issues, problems \nor methods. Although I want to caution political theory from focusing too narrowly on \nissues of social justice, I do not, at the same time want to dismiss the importance of \nthose questions, nor, more importantly do I want to collapse political theory into a form \nof perpetual and self-undermining critique. A prevalent, though not particularly \nprofitable tendency among political theorists has been to ransack recent continental \nphilosophy and French post-structuralism and post-Marxism for the theories, concepts \nand distinctions necessary to sustain political theory as a form of perpetual critique. My \nconcern here is not to poke fun at the \u2018funny foreigners\u2019 and their strange ways. That is a \nprevalent and mistaken view in contemporary political science. Instead my concern is \nthat this turn to the esoteric teaching of continental philosophers can become an excuse \n 9 \nfor meaningless word games or gibberish, or more importantly and equally destructively, \nit can become an intellectual cul-de-sac or a new kind of scholasticism. Too much of the \nattention of those who turn to continental discourses and idioms, is focused on \ndefending the terms of critique and fostering the permanence of critique as if that were \nan end in itself. The critique of ideological forms and discourses of power is too often \ndivorced from any more positive conception of the role and task of political theory. As \nsuch it is of ever diminishing interest to those who want to reflect on politics, much in \nthe way that ever more technical discussions of egalitarianism have a diminishing \nmarginal utility. Too much political theory written in this form is clever, obscure and self-\nserving: it is a viable way of passing the time in the face of the meaninglessness of the \nuniverse, but to be honest good novels, poetry and art (and perhaps football) are more \nedifying. \n  \nReengaging with political science \n \nIn conclusion I want to sum up my agenda for political theory and suggest how it might \nproceed. Firstly, it must avoid the tendency to lapse into antiquarianism as much of the \ncontemporary history of political thought has done. Political theory must retain a vibrant \nsense of its own past, but use that past as a resource. Secondly, British political thought \nmust break out from the long shadow of the guru\u2019s of the 1950s, Michael Oakeshott and \nIsaiah Berlin. Instead, if we must have gurus why not look at the case of H.L.A. Hart, \nwho in the long view will be seen to have had a highly beneficial effect of the \ndevelopment of political theory. Thirdly, that influence should not be distorted into a \nnormalised discourse of social justice as if that is the only interesting or possible topic of \npolitical thought. Fourthly, in breaking free from a tendency to normalisation, political \ntheory must also avoid the cul-de-sac of permanent critique as an end in itself, and the \n 10 \nincreasing esotericism of the post -Structuralist and post-Marxist discourses that shape \nmuch political theory.  My final point is to suggest that political theory can continue to \ncommand interest and respect within the sub-discipline if it does more to re-engage with \npolitical science. It can do this by challenging the terms of much that goes on in political \nscience. In so doing it continues as a kind of underlabourer supporting what political \nscientists do by conceptual clarification and theory construction, analysis and appraisal. It \ncan also do much to clarify the normative dimension of theory construction and \nchallenge the kinds of questions asked by political scientists. This much is pretty familiar \nand uncontroversial. However, there is more that political theory can do by challenging \nand framing the development of other aspects of political science to open new positive \nand normative questions. A good example of what I have in mind is some recent work \nby the political philosophers Philip Pettit and Christian List6 who have used traditional \nsocial choice theory to defend a conception of group agency. Admittedly their work is \nhighly controversial and still developing, but it suggests how asking unfamiliar questions \nof a familiar discourse can open both new avenues of enquiry and reopen others that \nconventional history of political thought would suggest had been confined to the \n\u2018dustbin\u2019 of history. If groups can be shown to exhibit some of the characteristics of \nagency this opens up interesting questions about responsibility and accountability that \ntend to be dismissed or distorted by a simplistic methodological individualism. I have no \ndoubt that there are many other instances in which the political theorist and the political \nscientist can continue interact in a way which expands the opportunities for both. By \nreconnecting with political science (as explanation, interpretation and prediction) and \nabandoning the idea of categorical separation, the task of the political scientist and the \npolitical theorist can be brought together in ways that are both appropriate to the \nmodern self-understanding, but which are also more true to the classical vision that we \ninherit from the great thinkers of the past. \n 11 \n \nNotes \n \n1.
