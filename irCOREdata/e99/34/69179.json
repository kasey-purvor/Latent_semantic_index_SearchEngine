Introduction\n[2] Energetic neutral atom (ENA) imaging in the mag-\nnetosphere relies on charge-exchange reactions between\nenergetic ions and cold atoms constituting the neutral geo-\ncorona and upper atmosphere. Each reaction allows a\nneutral atom to exit the collision with high velocity as an\nENA propagating unconstrained by magnetic and electric\nfields. Therefore ENAs can be used to image the ring\ncurrent and plasma sheet remotely by instruments such as\nthe medium energy neutral atom (MENA) imager on-board\nthe IMAGE satellite. The goal of this instrument is to\nderive the distribution function of magnetospheric ions.\nSince the medium is optically thin, MENA data are a\nmeasurement of the line-of-sight ENA flux at a given\nenergy. Inversion of images can then be used to give the\nion flux, assuming an accurate model of the geocoronal\nneutral density [Perez et al., 2001; DeMagistre et al., 2004].\nThus ENA imaging provides a tool with which to view a\nsnapshot of the global ion population of the magnetosphere\nand is a complementary technique to in situ measurements.\n[3] ENA imaging as a tool for investigating magneto-\nspheric structure was first proposed by Hovestadt and\nScholer [1976] and demonstrated experimentally by Roelof\n[1987]. A review by Williams et al. [1992] summarized the\nfield of ENA imaging in relation to other magnetosphere\nimaging techniques. Lui et al. [1996, 2001] provided first\ncomposition measurement of ENAs and numerous studies\nhave demonstrated the usefulness of ENA imaging includ-\ning observations from the first dedicated ENA imager on-\nboard the Astrid satellite [Brandt et al., 1997]. The first\nimages of ENA emissions using POLAR\/CEPPAD were\nreported by Henderson et al. [1997] who also reported ENA\nemissions during periods of substorm activity [Henderson et\nal., 2000]. High energy neutral atom (HENA) imager data\nhave successfully been used to analyze substorm injections\nand the storm time ring current [e.g., Brandt et al., 2002].\n[4] Resolving the plasma structure of the magnetosphere\nusing ENA imagers is a primary scientific goal of the\nIMAGE mission [Burch, 2000]. MENA detects energetic\nneutral atoms between 1 and \u000145 keV [e.g., Pollock et al.,\n2000, McComas et al., 2002]. The aim of this paper is to\ninvestigate how plasma sheet material is delivered to the\ninner magnetosphere during storms. A peak in ENA emis-\nsions is an indicator of a peak in the ion population and thus\nMENA data can be used to quantify the location of the peak\nENA flux, tracing how the ion population at a given energy\nevolves during storms. We present storm-time ENA fluxes\nobserved by MENA and for the first time present quantita-\ntive comparisons between MENA measured flux and the\nneutral flux calculated using a global, physics-based, ring-\ncurrent model.\n[5] Previous studies have compared ENA images with\nmodel data but there is no consensus on whether the\nlocation of peak flux occurs in the pre- or post-midnight\nsectors. Brandt et al. [2002] used HENA observations in\nthe 27\u201339 keV range to show the ENA peak, in response\nto large excursions in IMF-By, may rotate to the dawn\nregion during the mainphase. Recent work by Le et al.\n[2004] shows that for large Dst storms the peak in ion\nflux, and by implication the ENA flux, occurs near dusk\nwhilst Lui [2003] showed the peak plasma pressure is\nlocated in the pre-midnight sector, implying a pre-mid-\nnight peak in the ion distribution although neither study\nseparated main phase from recovery phase. It remains\nunclear how the peak in ENA flux evolves temporally\nthroughout a storm, although Ebihara et al. [2002]\nshowed statistical results from POLAR indicating that\nthe main and recovery phases are likely to be different\nin the energy range 1\u2013200 keV.\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 32, L17102, doi:10.1029\/2005GL023353, 2005\n1Space and Atmospheric Sciences, Los Alamos National Laboratory,\nLos Alamos, New Mexico, USA.\n2Space Science Center, University of New Hampshire, Durham, New\nHampshire, USA.\n3Instrumentation and Space Research Division, Southwest Research\nInstitute, San Antonio, Texas, USA.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/05\/2005GL023353$05.00\nL17102 1 of 5\n[6] For comparison with MENA data, the ring current-\natmosphere interaction (RAM) model [e.g., Jordanova et\nal., 1997] is used to produce equatorial ion distributions at\nthe time of MENA observations. Model data are then\nmapped along dipolar magnetic field lines using Liouville\u2019s\nTheorem. Since RAM calculates the pitch angles of the ring\ncurrent ions, it is possible to map the local pitch angle at the\npoint where the line-of-sight intersects a given field line, to\nthe corresponding pitch angle at the equator, to provide the\nglobal ion distribution. We interpolate RAM flux at a given\nenergy to calculate ion flux at the line-of-sight intersection.\nENA images are produced from this distribution by calcu-\nlating the line-of-sight integral ENA flux.\n[7] The Geospace Environment Modeling Inner Magne-\ntosphere-Storm (GEM IM-S) challenge describes criteria for\ncomparison of ENA observations with ring current models.\nThe 21 October 2001 storm is one of two storms selected\nfor the challenge which states that comparison between\nobservations and models should be carried out in the first\ninstance by comparing the location of the peak ENA flux at\na given energy. The work presented in this paper is in part\ncarried out in response to the challenge.\n2. Analysis\n[8] MENA data are analyzed using a recently devel-\noped technique which allows calculation of the differen-\ntial energy ENA flux [Henderson et al., 2005]. The\nmethod is a significant improvement in MENA data\nprocessing and was developed by re-deriving the instru-\nment\u2019s geometric factor and applying appropriate calibra-\ntion information.\n[9] The RAM model has been described by Jordanova\net al. [1997]. In brief, for a dipolar field, the bounce-\naveraged kinetic equation is solved to provide the ionized\nH+ flux in the equatorial plane, taking account of charge-\nexchange losses with neutral hydrogen and Coulomb\ncollisions with the thermal population. Wave-particle\ninteractions are neglected in this study. The magneto-\nspheric electric field is provided by taking the gradient of\na Kp-dependent Volland-Stern (RAM-VS) or Weimer\n(RAM-W) potential model. LANL geosynchronous satel-\nlite data are used as boundary conditions to the model.\nRAM has previously been used to study other storms\n[Jordanova et al., 2001, 2003] and recent work by\nZaharia et al. [2005] shows how RAM pressures can\nbe used as input to a 3-D equilibrium code.\n[10] The validity of modeling an assumed ring current\ndistribution to produce ENA images has been demonstrated\nby Henderson et al. [1999]. Here, a modified version of\ntheir software tool (developed for use with Polar\/CEPPAD)\nis used to investigate ENA fluxes that would be observed by\nMENA given an equatorial ion distribution provided by\nRAM. Such modeling is valuable as a step toward the\nultimate goal of inverting MENA images to provide the\nglobal ion distribution directly.\n[11] ENA fluxes based on RAM equatorial ion fluxes are\ncalculated for a given energy at L = 2 to L = 6.5 for all MLT\nand all pitch angles. To provide an ion distribution in\nregions beyond the bounds of the model (L < 2.0 and L >\n6.5) we assume the equatorial ion density inward of L =\n2.0 falls off linearly with distance from its value at the\nboundary. Outward of L = 6.5, the density is set to its value\nat L = 6.5. We assume the sole constituent of the geocorona\nis H+ with a neutral atmosphere provided by the\nChamberlain [1963] model with parameters determined\nby Rairden et al. [1986].\n3. Results\n[12] Storm onset occurred at \u000116 UT on 21 October\n2001 (see Figure 1) and a high energy penetrating particle\nbackground contaminates MENA data at the start of the\nstorm. Contamination is present during the first day of\nthe storm at a level that falls with time after storm onset.\nAs a result of this, and the characteristics of MENA the\nhighest count rates are obtained near the lower end of the\n1\u201340 keV energy range. Since our interest is how plasma\nsheet material is injected during storms, and then goes on\nto form the ring current, energies of 6 and 12 keV are\nused in this study.\n[13] For the period preceding the storm, IMF-Bz was\nslightly negative (\u0001\u00025 nT) with IMF-By positive and\nfairly steady (\u0001+5 nT). To illustrate the data\/model\ncomparison, data from 18\u201324 UT are analyzed. This\nperiod is considered representative of main phase storm\nactivity and useful for initial comparison of observations\nand theory. Figure 2 shows example MENA and RAM-\nVS fluxes at 6 keV. The MENA fluxes are a 60 minute\nintegration from 20\u201321 UT. A shorter integration time\nwould be preferable but is not possible for this storm due\nto the high background noted above. The RAM-VS\nfluxes are calculated using the forward modeling tool of\nHenderson et al. [1999]. The images in Figure 2 are\noverlaid on the solar-magnetic (SM) x-y plane. The red\naxis is the positive x-axis and each grid square is 2 \u0003\n2 Re in size.\n[14] The MENA and model images show strong peaks\nin ENA emissions close to the Earth, and extended\nemissions on the nightside. At low altitudes the ENA\nflux increases dramatically due to the increased neutral\ndensity of the upper atmosphere. Bright pixels close to\nEarth are associated with such \u2018\u2018low altitude emissions\u2019\u2019\nFigure 1. Dst and Kp indices plotted for five days in\nOctober 2001. The storm is characterized by a sudden onset,\na sharp fall to minimum Dst, an extended period of\nsawtooth activity and a smooth recovery phase.\nL17102 DENTON ET AL.: IMAGE\/MENA STORM-TIME MODEL COMPARISON L17102\n2 of 5\n[Roelof, 1997; Pollock et al., 2001; Brandt et al., 2001].\nHowever, in MENA saturation of one pixel may occur\nand spread to adjacent pixels in the polar direction\n[Pollock et al., 2001]. Such \u2018\u2018blooming\u2019\u2019 exaggerates flux\nin pixels adjacent to those closest to Earth along the\ndawn-dusk line. To avoid bias we neglect regions where\nblooming and low altitude emissions occur. We determine\nthe peak flux location between y = \u00b16.5 and x < \u00022 in\nthe SM x-y plane. Examination of MENA images leads\nus to conclude that we remove regions of blooming\nwithout removing valid data thus locating the peak\nENA flux primarily associated with storm processes.\nDue to the severe nature of the storm, the effects of a\nhigh background remain and MENA flux is elevated,\nalthough in a way that may not be uniform across the\nimage [Henderson et al., 2005]. Solely for this study, we\nassume a uniform background which does not affect the\nmeasured peak ENA flux location.\n[15] To provide a quantitative measure of the agree-\nment between experiment and theory we adopt the\ncriterion selected at the GEM 2004 Workshop; namely\nthat agreement between model results and ENA observa-\ntions should, in the first instance, be sought by matching\nthe modeled equatorial plane location of the peak in ENA\nemissions with the observed location. The location of the\npeak emissions is calculated by determining the intersec-\ntion of the MENA all-sky image with the equatorial plane\nand then calculating the point with the highest flux in this\nplane. Figure 3 shows the location of peak emissions\nmeasured by MENA and calculated by RAM-VS and\nRAM-W at 6 and 12 keV, from 18\u201324 UT. The measured\npeak at 6 keV is located in the post-midnight sector, close\nto local midnight, whilst the peak at 12 keV is located\nfurther duskwards, in the pre-midnight sector. RAM-VS\ngives an ENA peak closer to the measured value, whilst\nRAM-W shows an ENA peak further duskwards than that\nmeasured by MENA.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\n[16] The experimental and model results in Figure 2\nshow similar spatial features, namely high ENA flux\nclose to the Earth, with flux decreasing radially from\nthe Earth and maximized on the nightside, close to local\nmidnight. The peak in ENA emissions measured by\nMENA varies radially, and to a lesser extent, with local\ntime, throughout the storm although the magnitude of the\nflux at a given energy is roughly constant between 18\u2013\n24 UT. We interpret this as indicative of plasma sheet\nmaterial entering the inner magnetosphere during the time\nof the observations. The peak at 12 keV is located\nduskwards of the peak at 6 keV and this may be expected\nsince lower energy ions respond more to the electric field\nthan the magnetic field. Peaks in the magnitude of ENA\nflux do occur at other times during the storm, possibly\ndue to injections associated with sawtooth activity.\nFigure 2. The measured MENA and modeled RAM-VS\nfluxes at 6 keV between 20\u201321 UT on 21 October 2001.\nFigure 3. Plots of the location of peak ENA flux in the\nSM-xy plane at 6 and 12 keV as measured by MENA and\ncalculated by RAM-VS and RAM-Won 21 October 2001 at\n18\u201324 UT (UT is given by the numbering of the points).\nExcluding bright spots associated with low altitude\nemissions, the peak ENA flux measured by MENA and\ncalculated by RAM-VS is found on the nightside close to\nlocal midnight. (Note: the location of peak RAM-VS ENA\nfluxes in many cases is directly on the x-axis).\nL17102 DENTON ET AL.: IMAGE\/MENA STORM-TIME MODEL COMPARISON L17102\n3 of 5\n[17] The ENA peak flux is located close to local\nmidnight during the period of study and although it\nmoves radially during the storm, neither MENA nor\nRAM-VS indicate a large variation in the local time\nlocation of the peak ENA flux at a specific energy. This\nimplies the peak density of the injected plasma sheet\nmaterial also varies mostly in the radial direction during\nthe storm. RAM-VS results show the ENA peak located\nclose to local midnight in a similar location to that\ndetected by MENA. Additional calculations for the storm\nstudy presented by Zaharia et al. [2005] indicate that\nthe pressures calculated by RAM-W are unrealistic\nalthough the model does reproduce the actual Dst\nvariation of the storm quite well. Neither RAM-VS or\nRAM-W shows a large energy dependence of the peak\nENA location at 6 or 12 keV although both models\npredict further duskwards movement of the ENA peak at\nhigher energies.\n[18] Le et al. [2004] showed the peak equatorial ring\ncurrent intensity is located close to local midnight for\nsmall storms (\u000220 > Dst* > \u000240 nT), moving duskwards\nfor larger storms, although the authors did not examine if\ndifferences exist between main phase and recovery.\nBrandt et al. [2002] used HENA to propose a possible\nIMF-By dependence to the local time location of the ENA\npeak in the energy range 27\u201339 keV. They found\ninstances where the peak flux rotated toward dawn for\nstrongly positive IMF-By. Further study is required to\ndetermine if this effect occurs at energies in the MENA\nrange although preliminary study of other storms indicates\nthe peak ENA emissions in the MENA range can indeed\nbe found in the post-midnight sector. The body of work\non this subject, including the current study, indicates that\nthe location of peak flux is energy dependent, but\nvariables such as IMF orientation and storm strength\nare not negligible. We conclude by noting the agreement\nfound between MENA and RAM-VS gives confidence to\napply our method in future studies.\n5. Summary and Future Work\n[19] We have used the storm of 21 October 2001 to\ndevelop a technique of comparing experimental to theo-\nretically derived ENA fluxes. The storm is one of two\nchosen for the 2004 GEM IM-S challenge, one aim of\nwhich is to compare output from ring current models to\nENA observations. MENA observations are not optimal\nfor this storm and high count rates at the start of the\nevent limit the usefulness of observations at this time.\nDespite this we find broad agreement between theory and\nexperiment.\n[20] For the main phase of the 21 October 2001 storm we\nfind:\n[21] 1. The peak in ENA emissions at energies of 6 and\n12 keV is located close to local midnight.\n[22] 2. The measured peak flux at 12 keV is located\nduskwards of the peak flux at 6 keV. The peak flux location\nvaries in radial location from \u00012 to \u00015 Re during the period\nof study.\n[23] 3. A sophisticated ring current model predicts\nENA images similar to MENA images, with the peak\nequatorial flux at 6 and 12 keV located close to local\nmidnight.\n[24] The RAM predictions of the global ENA distribution\nlead us to conclude that the ion fluxes provided by the\nmodel are reliable in these circumstances. Further compar-\nisons to determine how, and in what way, the flux of ENAs\nobserved by MENA during storms is spatially, temporally\nand energy dependent are planned. We also aim to test the\nuse of more sophisticated field and potential models and to\naddress the question of how ENAs respond during the pre-\nstorm and recovery phases.\n[25] Acknowledgments.
