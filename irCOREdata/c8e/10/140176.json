INTRODUCTION \n  \nFull characterisation of the complex, time varying 3 dimensional (3D) flows encountered in \nengineering systems such as turbomachinery has long been the goal of research in flow \nmeasurement instrumentation. Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) is capable of producing high \nquality, high spatial resolution data from a wide range of flow systems. The demands for \nimproved fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and the requirement for high quality data to allow \nvalidation of  increasingly complex computational fluid dynamic codes is driving the \ndevelopment of new, simultaneous 3D laser velocimetry configurations. \n \n3D flow characterisation requires the presence of 3 LDV channels in the flow, distinguished \nusing wavelength, time or frequency bias. Ideally the channels directly measure the three \northogonal velocity components. In general, however, the optical access to the flow is limited, \nsuch that the measurements have to be made with the 3 channels being inclined at an angle with \nrespect to the Cartesian co-ordinate system. The transformation between the non-orthogonal \nmeasurement system and the Cartesian system is sensitive to uncertainties in the angular \nconfiguration of the channels,  resulting in large errors in the calculated velocity components.  \n \nA number of  3D LDV configurations using Doppler difference channels have been \ndemonstrated, all of which show significant limitations when considered in the context of the \nlimited optical access available in turbomachinery applications. In this paper the development \nof a single headed, fibre optic based, 3D laser Doppler velocimeter is discussed. The probe uses \ntwo Doppler difference channels to measure the transverse velocity components, and a \nreference beam channel to measure the on axis velocity component. It is shown that the use of \noptical fibres is essential to the operation of the probe. \n \n 3 \nII. 3D  LASER DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY \n \nA number of LDV configurations have been reported, and commercial instrumentation \ndeveloped, all based upon the measurement of the Doppler frequency shift imposed on light \nscattered from particles entrained within the flow. The Doppler shift is uniquely determined by \nthe wavelength of the illuminating light, the orientation of the viewing direction with respect to \nthe incident beam, and upon the velocity component perpendicular to the bisector of the \nilluminating and viewing directions. Measurement of the frequency shift may be achieved in a \nnumber of ways; heterodyning the scattered light with a local oscillator derived from the \nilluminating beam, as in the reference beam anemometer\n1\n , mixing the light scattered from two \nilluminating beams, as in the Doppler difference, technique\n2,3, using an atomic or molecular \nline filter to transduce the frequency shift into a change in intensity\n4\n, or measured directly on a \nFabry-P\u00e9rot interferometer\n5\n. \n \nThe reference beam LDV configuration, shown in figure 1(a), was the first to be developed. \nScattered light collected from the flow is mixed with a reference beam on a detector, yielding a \nbeat signal at the Doppler frequency. The measured frequency shift is given by the expression \n\uf06e\n\uf06c\n\uf071\n\uf062\nD\nV\uf03d\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e7\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f7\n2\n2\ncos cos( )         ( 1) \nwhere \uf075D is the measured Doppler frequency, \uf06c the wavelength, V the velocity and \uf071 angle \nbetween the illumination and collection directions. The velocity component measured is \nparallel to the bisector of the illumination and collection directions. When working in \nbackscatter this allows measurement of the on-axis velocity component.  While this \nconfiguration has been used to measure flow velocities in real engineering applications, and \nformed the basis of the first 3D LDV configuration\n6\n, it  suffers from a number of practical \n 4 \nlimitations, including the dependence of the measured frequency shift upon the viewing \ndirection, poor signal to noise characteristics due to mismatch in the ratio of signal to reference \nbeam powers, the stringent alignment conditions required to achieve efficient heterodyning \nwhich demand alignment of signal and reference beams to better than a few minutes of arc, and \na limited collection aperture due to coherence considerations and broadening of the Doppler \nfrequency spectrum. The reference beam system has a very long measurement volume, limiting \nthe spatial resolution, complicating near wall measurements. When working in direct \nbackscatter the Doppler shift measured in the reference beam method is twice the velocity \ndivided by the wavelength, placing a limit of around 40m\/s on the maximum velocity which \nmay be measured using illumination at 800 nm and  a 100 MHz signal processing unit. \n \nThe development of the Doppler difference method, shown in figure 1(b), in which the \nfrequency shift is independent of viewing direction and is dependent only upon the geometry of \nthe illuminating beams, lead to reference beam systems being largely abandoned. In the \nDoppler difference technique two mutually coherent beams are crossed in the flow to create an \ninterference pattern. The scattered light is amplitude modulated at a frequency given by the \nratio of the velocity to the fringe spacing. \n\uf028 \uf029\uf06e\n\uf06c\n\uf071\n\uf062\nD\nV\uf03d\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e7\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f7\n2\n2\nsin cos         ( 2) \nThe velocity component measured is perpendicular to the bisector of the illuminating beams, \ni.e. the transverse velocity component. The Doppler difference method allowed large apertures \nto be used to collect the scattered light, and alignment and beam ratio requirements to be \nrelaxed, being  transferred to the illumination section of the system, where they could be more \neasily satisfied.   \n \n 5 \nA number of 3D LDA configurations have been reported\n7,8\n, and commercial instrumentation \ndeveloped. The limited optical access available in many real  flow system complicates the \ndevelopment of 3D instrumentation. As a result,  3D LDA instrumentation generally relies \nupon the use of three inclined  Doppler difference channels, which requires careful calibration \nand alignment to achieve meaningful results. A number of schemes using Doppler difference \nchannels to directly measure the transverse velocity components and a reference beam channel \nto measure the on-axis velocity component  have been proposed\n9,10,11,12\n with a number of 2D \nLDV configurations using a single Doppler difference channel and a reference beam channel \nreported, constructed using conventional optical components,  and the extension to \nsimultaneous 3D measurement discussed. To date, however, there has been no report of the \noperation of such a simultaneous 3D LDV instrument, which may be related to the practical \ndifficulties encountered when implementing reference beam anemometers using conventional \n(bulk) optical components . The following section analyses and compares the accuracy of a \nnumber of single headed 3D LDA configurations. \n 6 \nIII. ACCURACY CONSIDERATIONS. \n \nA. Introduction \n \nExtracting the 3D information from data produced by a single headed 3D LDV probe requires a \nmatrix transformation from the non-orthogonal measurement co-ordinate system to the \nCartesian system. The conventional way to analyse the performance of  such an operation is to \nconsider the conditioning of the transformation matrix\n13\n.  The system Ax = b is said to be well \nconditioned if small errors in the coefficients have a small effect on the solution, and is ill-\nconditioned if the effect is large. The solution may be thought of in terms of  the intersection of \nthree planes. If the planes are orthogonal, then the intersection point is well defined, and small \nerrors in the inclination of the planes have little effect upon the location of the intersection. \nThis corresponds to being well conditioned, and the transformation matrix has a condition \nnumber of unity. However, as the relative inclination of the planes is reduced, any uncertainties \nin the geometry may result in large inaccuracies in the calculated intersection point, and the \ncondition number increases. In this section the matrix conditioning of 4 single headed 3D LDA \nconfigurations are compared. The configurations are illustrated in figure 2. \n \nThe 3D micro LDV reported by Ahmed\n14,15\n employs three angularly  separated Doppler \ndifference channels in the geometry illustrated in figure 2(a). Its practical implementation \nutilised a  single Doppler difference channel in the flow, rotated to three positions, separated by \n120\uf0b0, to perform the measurements. The 5 beam 3D LDA system (figure 2(b)) uses colour  \nseparation to multiplex the three Doppler difference measurement channels\n15\n. Two blue beams, \nderived from the output from an Ar\n+\n ion laser, lie in the vertical plane, forming a single \nDoppler difference channel, measuring the transverse, y, velocity component. In the horizontal \n 7 \nplane the output from the centre of the lens is comprised of  co-propagating violet and green \nbeams, which form two Doppler difference channels with the violet and green beams exiting \nfrom the either side. The measurements provided by these channels contain information on the \ntransverse, x , velocity component and the on-axis, z, velocity component. The first 3D LDA \nconfiguration reported relied upon the use of three spatially multiplexed reference beam \nchannels using a single illuminating beam\n1\n, as shown in figure 2(c) The original configuration \noperated in forward scatter, with three angularly separated receiving heads arranged \nsymmetrically about the  optical axis. The geometry could also be configured to operate in \nbackscatter using a single probe head. The configuration illustrated in figure 2(d), which will be \nconsidered in more detail later in this paper, is being proposed by the authors to overcome \nsome of the limitations of previously reported 3D LDA geometries. It relies upon the use of \ntwo Doppler difference channels to directly measure the transverse velocity components, and a \nreference beam channel to measure the on axis velocity component. The illumination beam for \nthe reference beam channel is off-axis, with the aim of reducing the effects of flare and \nimproving the performance of near-wall measurements. \n \nB. Matrix Conditioning \n \nThe condition number of  each of the transformation matrices was calculated as a function of \nthe f number of the probe, and are compared in figure 3. In general, it is considered that \ncondition numbers < 20 should provide adequate performance\n12\n, which implies that all of the \nconfigurations should operate with small uncertainties in the calculated velocity components \nfor f numbers <5. Typically, to allow measurements to be made along  the entire length of a \nturbine blade, f numbers > 4 have to be employed. The 3D micro LDV and 3D reference beam \nconfigurations show very similar performance even though they predominantly measure \n 8 \ndifferent velocity components: the on-axis component in the case of the 3D reference beam \ngeometry, and the transverse components in the 3D micro LDV.  The  condition number of the \nhybrid probe is consistently less that that of the other configurations.  The conditioning number \nprovides a convenient figure of merit for comparing the relative tolerances placed on the \ncalibration and alignment of the configurations. However, this does not take into account the \nrelative magnitudes of the velocity components being calculated, which has a significant \nimpact upon the uncertainties in the results, as noted by Chervin\n16\n and Neti\n17\n. \n \nC. Error Analysis \n  \nFollowing a similar approach to that reported by Morrison\n18\n, the errors in the measured \nvelocities were calculated for the single headed probes as a function of the probe f number.  \nThe approach is outlined below. \n  \nThe transformation between the non-orthogonal measurement co-ordinate system and the \nCartesian system may be described by  \n\uf028 \uf029\nU\nU\nU\na a a\na a a\na a a\nVx\nVy\nVz\n1\n2\n3\n11 12 13\n21 22 23\n31 32 33\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf03d\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n( , ) ( , ) ( , )\n, ( , ) ( , )\n( , ) ( , ) ( , )\n\uf061 \uf067 \uf061 \uf067 \uf061 \uf067\n\uf061 \uf067 \uf061 \uf067 \uf061 \uf067\n\uf061 \uf067 \uf061 \uf067 \uf061 \uf067\n     ( 3) \n \nwhere the matrix coefficients aij(\uf061\uf02c\uf067\uf029\uf02c\uf020where \uf061\uf020and \uf020\uf067 are defined in figure 2,  are dependent \nupon the angular configuration of the probe head, Ui are the measured velocity components, \nand Vx,y,z are the orthogonal velocity components.

In the following discussion, the angular uncertainties in the \nprobe head geometry, d\uf061 and d\uf067 are assumed to be 1\uf0b0, and the velocity measurement accuracy \nto be 1%. The graph shown in figure 4 shows a comparison between the performances of the \nfour 3D LDA configurations outlined in the previous section, assuming that the velocity \ncomponents in the Cartesian system are Vx=Vy=10 m\/s, Vz=1 m\/s. These values were chosen \nsince, in general, the on-axis velocity components which will be experienced in our application \nwill be no more than 10% of the transverse components. The errors shown in figure 4 will scale \napproximately linearly with the total velocity, provided that the components are in the ratio \n10:10:1. The configurations based around the use of three Doppler difference channels exhibit \nlarge errors for probes with f numbers > 2. Typically, for turbomachinery applications, optical \naccess and working distances dictate the use of probes with f numbers > 4.  These \nconsiderations have lead to the development of a single headed probe  relying upon the use of \n 10 \ntwo Doppler difference channels to directly measure the transverse velocity components, and a \nreference beam channel to measure the on axis velocity component \n \nIV. PROBE DESIGN \n \nThe use of optical fibres is central to the operation of the hybrid probe, easing the limitations \nassociated with bulk optic reference beam configurations, allowing the direct measurement of \nthe on-axis velocity component, and allowing the sensitive semiconductor laser diodes and \ndetectors to be isolated from the flow region. Constraining the signal and reference beams to \npropagate through the same fibre automatically satisfies the stringent alignment conditions \nrequired to achieve optimum heterodyning. The fibres spatially filter the collected scattered \nradiation, producing high quality wavefronts. We have recently demonstrated a polarisation \nbased  optical configuration which allows optimisation of the signal to reference beam ratios \nwhile making optimum use of the received light, a significant consideration when using infra-\nred radiation\n19\n. The use of a direct backscatter configuration for the reference beam channel, \nhowever, produces a long measurement volume, limiting the ability to perform measurements \nnear solid surfaces. To overcome these limitations, the off-axis configuration shown in figure  \n3 (d) has been developed. \n \nFive beams illuminate the flow, forming two Doppler difference channels and a reference beam \nchannel. the Doppler difference channels directly measure the transverse velocity  components, \nwhile the  off-axis illumination direction of the reference beam channel (7\uf0b0) results in the \nmeasurement predominantly containing the axial component with a small contribution from the \ntransverse components. The use of off axis illumination is aimed at reducing the effects of flare \nfrom solid surfaces, improving the performance of near wall measurements, and reducing the \nlength of the measurement volume. \n 11 \n \nFigure 5 shows a cross section of the probe head. Light is delivered to the head by polarisation \nmaintaining (pm) optical fibre, to ensure matched linear polarisation states for the interfering \nbeams, and thus optimum fringe visibility. The fibre ends are terminated with GRIN lens \ncollimators, and the beams focused into the flow by the front lens. The outer portion of the lens \n(f = 200 mm) collimates backscattered light, and the second lens launches this into the multi-\nmode fibre. The central portion of the bi-focal lens (f = 40 mm) launches scattered light into the \npm fibre mode fibre to act as the signal for the reference beam channel.  The specifications of \nthe probe have been chosen to allow the probe to perform measurements on turbomachinery \ntest are rigs, and are detailed in table 1.  \n \nV. Experimental Configuration and Results \n \nThe three measurement channels are distinguished using wavelength-division-multiplexing, \nimplemented using three 150 mW SDL 5420 series semiconductor laser diodes operating at \nslightly differing wavelengths around 800 nm. \n \nFigure 6 shows a schematic of the lay-out of the of the launch\/receive unit. The output from the \nlaser diodes are coupled into polarisation maintaining fibre. The two Doppler difference \nchannels incorporate fibre pigtailed 40 MHz Bragg cell frequency shifters which act as 50\/50 \nbeamsplitters and allow direction discrimination. The pigtailed Bragg Cells have an insertion \nloss of < 2dB. The 40 MHz rf drive signal for the Bragg cells  is derived from the Dantec BSA \nsignal processor. The diffraction efficiency of the Bragg cells is controlled via a voltage applied \nto an rf amplifier, allowing optimisation of the intensity  ratio of the beams. The reference \nbeam channel incorporates a variable split ratio  polarisation preserving directional coupler, set \n 12 \nsuch that 95 % of the power is guided to the probe head, and the remaining 5% used as the \nreference beam. This ratio can be adjusted to optimise the signal to noise ratio. \n \nScattered light is delivered to the detectors via a multi-mode fibre and a polarisation preserving \nfibre. The output from the multimode fibre is incident upon a diffraction grating to demultiplex \nthe Doppler difference channels\u2019 wavelengths. The two Doppler difference signals are then \nmonitored on avalanche photodiodes. The signal for the on axis measurement  is derived from \nthe polarisation maintaining return fibre, and mixed with a frequency shifted reference beam. A \nband pass filter is used to remove the unwanted signals from the Doppler difference channels. \nThe diffraction efficiency of the Bragg Cell  is again  voltage controlled, providing  a \nconvenient  method for controlling the signal to noise ratio. The signals are analysed on three \nEnhanced Dantec Burst Spectrum Analysers. \n \nFigure 7 shows 3D data obtained from a rotating disk for the three measurement channels. The \nmeasurements were performed using the relative orientation of the disc and probe head as \nillustrated in figure 8. The data points show the orthogonal  velocity components calculated \nfrom the transformed Doppler frequency measurements.  The solid lines indicate the orthogonal \nvelocity components predicted from measurements of the angular frequency of the disc, \nshowing good agreement with the measured data. \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil (EPSRC) UK for funding under grant number GR\/H80606.  \n 13 \nFigure Captions \n \nFigure 1(a).
