Using a longitudinal qualitative case study, four general processes are \nidentified (experimentation, reflexivity, organising and sensing), that together provide a \nmechanism to sustain the enterprise.  The analysis draws on concepts from entrepreneurship \nand complexity science.  We suggest that an entrepreneur\u2019s awareness of the role of these \nparallel processes will facilitate their approaches to sustaining and developing enterprises.  \nWe also suggest that these processes operate in parallel at multiple levels, including the self, \nthe business and inter-firm networks.  This finding contributes to a general theory of \nentrepreneurship. A number of areas for further research are discussed arising from this \nresult. \n \nKey words: \nEntrepreneurship; complexity theory, emergence; sustainability  \n \n 2\n \n \nThis article derives insights from complexity theory into the managerial processes \nthat presaged the emergence of new business models and organisational structures in an \nestablished entrepreneurial small firm in the airline services industry.  By means of an in-\ndepth qualitative case study, we identify four dynamic managerial processes \n(experimentation, reflexivity, organising and sensing), inherent in the everyday practice of \nthe management team, and in particular the Managing Director as he made strategic choices \nto remain \u2018fit\u2019 in a fast-moving industry.  Although this study is limited to one case, we \nconclude that the dynamic processes we have identified provide insight into the sustainability \nof entrepreneurial firms over time. Better understanding of these processes may support \nentrepreneurs and their stakeholders manage the sustainability of the firm.   \nThe paper commences with a discussion of the application of complexity theory to \nentrepreneurship. This is followed by the case study where we ground the theory in an \nempirical study of entrepreneurial practice: a longitudinal analysis of an entrepreneurial firm, \nFlightDirectors, which is sustained through the creation of a new business models and \nstructures at critical junctures for the firm and the industry.  Finally we present our \nconclusions as to the practical and theoretical implications of our study.  In this we contribute \nto theory by proposing that the processes identified helps to explain the mechanism by which \nthe agency of entrepreneurship produces (new) structures, as well as raising questions for \nfurther research.   \n \nComplexity Theory, Entrepreneurship and Emergence  \nThis section begins with an introduction to key concepts in the linkage of complexity \ntheory to the study of entrepreneurship.  The Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction is \nhighly resonant with complexity theory \u2013 a study of order-breaking and order creating \n 3\nprocesses.  The potential value of emergence, a central pillar of complexity theory, as an \norganising concept for theorising entrepreneurship is highlighted here, relating as it must to \nthe production of novelty \u2013 new firms, new products, new processes, new business structures \nand new firms.   \nComplexity has been a focus for research into biological and physical systems since \nthe 1950s.  McKelvey (1999a) identifies the origin of complexity research in Prigogine et al \n(Prigogine & Stengers, 1984; Nicolis & Prigogine, 1989) work on dissipative structures, \nwhich seeks to explain the emergence of order in the physical and biological sciences.  \nComplexity research has since become a broad church (Stacey, 2003; Burnes, 2005; Houchin \n& MacLean 2005) with applications in the social, management and organisational domains, \nnot just in the sciences; Lichtenstein (2000a) has identified 13 schools of thought in \ncomplexity research that have arisen since those early days, each with its own portfolio of \nmethodological and theoretical concerns that he suggests have all been used to generate \ninsights by management theorists.  While there is a diversity of approaches, most researchers \nwould agree that open, dynamic, non-linear systems provide a better basis for theorising \nabout order creation than linear mechanics (Lichtenstein & Mendenhall, 2002), based mainly \non the influential work of the Santa Fe Institute (Lewin et al., 1999).  The emergence of order \nin any system is seen as a co-evolutionary process arising from the interaction between \nheterogeneous agents in the system and is characterised by constant change, mutual \ndependence between agents (Holland, 1998; Lichtenstein, 2000b) and sensitivity to initial \nconditions (Gleick, 1987). \nComputational modelling can illustrate this perspective for simple rule-based \nsystems, demonstrating how order can arise in an unpredictable manner, as agents in the \nsystem interact with each other: a classic example, the flocking of birds can be observed in \nan holistic sense as ordered patterns that emerge from aggregate individual behaviour.  More \n 4\ncomplicated mechanisms and outcomes can be modelled in the \u2018complex adaptive system\u2019 \n(CAS) approach, where agents may adapt their behaviour by changing their rules as \nexperience accumulates within the model (Holland, 1998). \nThe potential resonance of complexity theory with organisational life has been \nviewed by both academics and practitioners as a means of understanding organisations; this \nhas led to the design of organisational strategies and the launch of change programmes   \n(Lichtenstein 2000b; Stacey et al, 2002; Burnes 2005; Houchin & MacLean 2005; \nLichtenstein et al 2006).  As Burnes (2005) notes, while the origins of complexity theory are \nin mathematics, organisational complexity researchers have taken a linguistic turn, where \ncomplexity concepts are used to create a metaphorical language for change and development \n(Lissack, 1997), rather than computational modelling.  Stacey\u2019s (2003) \u2018complex responsive \nprocess\u2019 (CRP) approach develops this further, recognising the significance of narrative \nprocesses, ideology and power relations in achieving organisational outcomes. \nAs part of that broader movement, the salience of complexity theory to understanding \nentrepreneurship is becoming recognised (Fuller & Moran 2000, 2001; Lichtenstein 2000b; \nMcKelvey, 2004), recognising the importance of both non-equilibrium systems and multiple \nlevels of analysis in entrepreneurship research.  Although different conceptual approaches are \ntaken, it is clear that the emergence of order is a central organising principle for these \nauthors.  McKelvey (2004) argues for complexity science as the very basis for \nentrepreneurial research, with the emergence of order in pre-equilibrium conditions at the \nheart of the analysis, rather than classical Darwinian evolutionary approaches, which he \nargues are inadequate due to their inherent reliance on equilibrium conditions.  In his \nanalysis, McKelvey (2004) contends that this approach is consonant with the creative \ndestruction of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship (Schumpeter, 1934), where entrepreneurship \nis defined as discontinuous change that destroys economic equilibria.  As old orders are \n 5\ndestroyed, new economic \u2018orders\u2019 such as new firms, products and organisational \ninnovations are created in contexts that are far from equilibrium. \nIn this context, emergence is a powerful trope for the way novel structures come into \nbeing.  In general terms, conjunctions of forces can produce an outcome that is more than, or \nat least behaves differently from, the sum of its constituent parts (Mill, 1843).  Current use of \nthe trope is informed by systems theory and in particular by the concept of emergent \nstructures (Nicolis & Prigogine, 1989) in the New Science of complexity (Maguire & \nMcKelvey 1999), after (Gleick 1987).  For Holland (1998) emergence is \u201cabove all a product \nof coupled, context dependent interactions\u201d (p122).  McKelvey (2004) highlights the \nsignificance of the concept of \u2018adaptive tension\u2019 as a driver in the emergence of order; \nadaptive tension occurs when an energy differential arises in system, generating a \ndisequilibrium that pushes the system to re-order from a current state.  In this vein, \nLichtenstein (2000c) identifies \u2018threshold events\u2019, where an entrepreneurial venture is \npressured, due to, say, fiscal concerns.  Once a critical threshold is reached, non-linear self-\norganising processes will occur, initiating the spontaneous emergence of new levels of order \nin the system.  At this point, new organisational goals, structure and strategy will result, a \nnew \u2018attractor\u2019 in complexity terms (Lichtenstein, 2000b).   \nThe literature on entrepreneurship includes notions of emergence, in particular the \nemergence of new enterprises, for example, (Katz & Gartner, 1988; Gartner, 1993; Fischer et \nal, 1997; Fleming & Sorenson, 2001; Garud & Karnoe, 2003; Busenitz et al, 2003).  This \nliterature tends to focus on a) new start-ups and b) what emerges and when, rather than on the \ndynamic processes and conditions that produce the emergent properties (Lichtenstein et al, \n2006).  For example, in attempting to articulate the features of an \u2018emergent organisation\u2019, \nKatz & Gartner (1988) after McKelvey (1982), proposed that the defining features of \nemerging organisation were intentions, resources, boundaries and exchange.  That model, as \n 6\nsuch, does not produce a theory but shows how consideration of different ontological \ndomains (\u201cintentions\u201d being conceptual, \u201cresources\u201d being real, \u201cboundaries\u201d being linked to \nthe firm and \u201cexchange\u201d being inter-firm), and the connections between them, is relevant to \ntheorising emergence. As they acknowledged (p433), Katz & Gartner\u2019s attempt to objectify \nregularities failed to identify the processes producing regularities.  As Low & McMillan \n(1988) point out, to understand entrepreneurship, one needs to understand process, context \nand outcomes, or \u201c[how] strategies are constructed, moulded and adapted in processes of \ninteraction with environments\u201d (Aldrich & Martinez 2001, p 520).   \nMore recently Lichtenstein et al, (2007) have developed a more processual \nunderstanding that does emphasise dynamism and process.  They note the linear perspective \nof much of the extant new venture creation literature, suggesting that complexity theory \nprovides a better approach than the traditional attempts to make causal linkages between \nspecific activities particular outcomes, such as new firm registrations.  Because of the lack of \nconsistent findings in studies on the types and sequences of events that lead to emergence, \nLichtenstein et al (2007, p. 238-40) moot that organisational emergence should be examined \n\u201cat a more general level by examining patterns of new venture creation activities, rather than \nfocusing on specific organising activities themselves\u201d.  Organising for new venture creation, \nthey argue, is likely to be non-linear and temporally complex, with highly interdependent sets \nof activities occurring together (see also Meyer et al, 2005).  The outcomes of this study \nsupports the insight from complexity theory that organisational emergence requires a \n\u2018scaffolding\u2019 of interlinked components that build a momentum for emergence within the \nsystem that triggers (re) organisation after a critical threshold has been reached in conditions \nof adaptive tension.  Lichtenstein et al note the importance of entrepreneurial learning and \nknowledge creation during and leading up to emergence, suggesting that entrepreneurs must \ncombine advanced thinking processes and time- and life-management skills, sustaining a \n 7\nmulti-dimensional focus for many months at a time \u2013 and by implication, a high degree of \nentrepreneurial competence. \n \nMethodology  \n \nThe Search Space for Processes and Pattern \nBy taking a complexity theory perspective we are driven towards a methodology that \nis sensitive to the creation of patterns via explicit processes, which are inherent to the \nenvironment in which the actors are situated (i.e. are self-organising and not exogenously \nimposed per se.).  We suggest that complexity theory has the potential to provide insights \ninto entrepreneurship, most powerfully through the notion of emergence driven by adaptive \ntension, with change (in patterns) occurring as critical thresholds arise.  Lichtenstein et al \n(2007) provides convincing evidence that interdependent patterns of wide-ranging \nentrepreneurial activities, rather than individual acts such as creating business plans, are also \nsignificant in initiating processes of emergence.  Our methodological search space for \nprocesses necessarily needs to be open to multiple activities extended over time.  The space \nalso needs to include multiple actors and the relationships between them.  Consonant with \nFuller & Lewis (2003) and Stacey (2003) we believe that the everyday sense-making \nprocesses of the central entrepreneur(s) are socially mediated and situated in the social \ncontext of the firm, its relationships and its networks.  This is not to diminish the role of the \nindividual; certainly the importance of the entrepreneur to the outcomes of a particular small \nbusiness has been extensively delineated (Carland, et al. 1984, p356; Hornaday, 1990).  \nHowever, we must take into account the management of the relationship between the small \nentrepreneurial firm and its immediate stakeholder environment.   \n \n 8\nOur methodology is also intended to develop recommendations for practising entrepreneurs, \ni.e. to have a normative dimension.  While complexity theory suggests that it is not possible \nto predict or determine outcomes in advance, like Snowden (2002) and Stacey (2003) we \nbelieve that understanding how meaningful patterns of behaviour emerge can enhance the \nlikelihood of desirable outcomes through increased management competence.  In doing so, it \nis necessary to take into account the agility and foresight required by small, entrepreneurial \nfirms to sustain their existence through flexible responses to uncertain environments.  By and \nlarge, unless a firm controls the entrance of a disruptive innovation (Christensen, 1997) into \nthe market, there is little possibility of effecting large scale structural change in the business \nenvironment.  Typically then, entrepreneurial management practice in a smaller firm cannot \nbe teleological: the firm is unlikely to have the power to achieve a particular stated goal.  \nEntrepreneurs have to act on contingency, where strategy is what is possible in an \nenvironment where the future is unpredictable e.g. (Sarasvathy, 2001), dominated by large \nfirms and fast-moving technological and industrial standards that co-evolve in complex non-\nlinear ways (Garnsey & Heffernan, 2005).   \n \nThe Case Study  \nFlightDirectors Ltd. was established by two founders in 1984 to provide brokerage \nservices in the air travel industry. The business started in the garage of one of the co-\nfounders.  The business activities have changed significantly over its life.  In September 2001 \nwith over 100 staff in a UK airport location and in central London, it was chartering two 737 \naircraft, brokering charter flights and running a multi-customer overspill ticketing call centre.  \nThe brief history is: \n \n 9\n\u2022 1st July 1984 Business started with three people brokering between airlines and \nholiday tour operators \n\u2022 1987 Consolidation in industry removes customer base, a growth relationship \nestablished with one major client, opportunity driven growth \n\u2022 1992 Four separate business units operating, none of which were brokering as in \n1984, millionth passenger \n\u2022 1993 Deregulation negated brokerage role and \u201ceverything began to unravel\u201d, \ndownsizing to two business divisions \n\u2022 1994 Introduction of management support framework for niche brokerage activity \ndriven by individual projects \n\u2022 1996 Introduction of operational managerial structure and strategies formed from this, \nbased on orientation of the operational managers. \n\u2022 2000 Two divisions created and call centre established  \n\u2022 2001 pre September 11: over 100 employees, ticketing call centre and a branded \ncharter service with two 737 aircraft. Post September 11, charter service in \nliquidation, call centre survives only at 11th hour. \n\u2022 2001-2007 The business continues in a highly dynamic and competitive environment, \nwith around one hundred staff providing general sales agency (a trade norm) and \noverspill ticketing call centre.  Two founders, including Argyle, still own the \ncompany (currently registered as Fight Directors Scheduled Services Limited). \n \nFlightDirectors was a suitable case for study because an airline brokerage business has to \ninnovate to remain \u2018fit\u2019 within the business environment, by restructuring or the \nestablishment of new corporate ventures.  This is because it has little power or influence over \nsupra-national events that have the potential to threaten the survival of the firm unless \n 10\ndecisive managerial action is taken, typically over relatively short timescales.  For example, \nthe effects of terrorist action on the demand for travel, the continued opening of trading \nregulations, direct internet bookings and air-crashes are all features of the landscape outside \nthe control of the firm.   \n \nThe Use of Analytical Narrative  \nQualitative data has been collected over a 5-year period from a number of sources. \nThe primary data source was a reflective account produced by Paul Argyle, one of the \noriginal founders of FlightDirectors and currently owner and Managing Director of the \ncompany.  Argyle\u2019s self written historical account and analysis of entrepreneurial \nmanagement in FlightDirectors, which included interviews with others in the managerial \nteam, was presented as a Master\u2019s dissertation in 2000 (Argyle 2000).  After this publication, \nextended collaboration has continued between the subject and the researchers, through \ninterviews, further notes, Weblogs and informal discussions up to the present day; this \nincluded visits to the company premises and meetings with members of the senior \nmanagement team and other staff.  The narrative produced in the dissertation and further \nnotes were re-analysed by the researchers from the perspective of the \u2018foresight\u2019 inherent in \naccounts of change in the organisation, in relation to strategic decision making.  By foresight \nwe mean the ways in which changes were anticipated, planned and\/or brought about.   \nA very significant driver in this project was that practically relevant knowledge \nshould be generated as well as a contribution to the entrepreneurship and complexity \nliterature.  Thus a \u2018mode 2\u2019 ethos was prevalent throughout (Starkey & Madan, 2001). \nThe approach to grounding our theoretical analysis in empirical data was an iterative \nprocess between deductive theory and a gradual understanding of process through mainly \ninductive means.  Throughout the study period, both inductive and deductive approaches \n 11\nhave been used: inductive analysis, explicitly informed by extant theory.  Thus, in Argyle\u2019s \noriginal dissertation, he used a set of extant concepts as an analytical framework.  These were \ndrawn from literature on entrepreneurship and small business integrated with concepts drawn \nfrom complexity theory.  Specifically these were  \nI) A conception of hierarchical ontological or systemic levels drawn from Fuller & \nMoran (2000, 2001) which Argyle operationalised analytically as: 1) Individual \ncognitions\/mental models\/constructs\/values, 2) Individual capabilities\/motivations, 3) \nInternal \u2018functional\u2019 activities\/relationships, 4) Business Model \n(concept\/strategy\/vision), 5) Business to Business relationships, 6) \nNetworks\/clusters\/micro-economies, 7) Industry\/Macro economic factors.   \nII) Metaphors from complexity science, namely bifurcation (in this case synonymous \nwith critical points of change) adaptive tension (in this case synonymous with \nmotivations \/ incentives \/ imperatives to change), attractors (in this case synonymous \nwith a dominant logic or organising principle) and rules (in this case normative ways \nof doing things or expectations that people had).   \n \nThese concepts were used by Argyle in his historical analysis of the firm, to analyse, from \nthe point of view of understanding strategic foresight, in what ways changes in company \nstrategy emerged: were they anticipated or endogenously initiated, or were they imposed by \nexogenous forces; further, where, within or between the multiple layers, did such foresight \nreside?  Was it possible to detect general dynamics of emergence operating across or between \nthe ontologies?   \nHaving described events at critical points in the firm\u2019s history (critical events and \nchanges in path i.e. bifurcations) through this conceptual framework, Argyle reflected on the \nrules that appeared to pertain to behaviour linking one level or ontology with another. For \n 12\nexample, linking functional activities with vision or strategies, or linking the business with its \nstakeholders.  His evidence showed that different \u2018rules\u2019 or heuristics or ways of doing \nthings, applied in different divisions of the business, i.e. the nature of the dynamics related to \ncontext and to the people involved.  \nThis extensive self-analysis was then re-analysed by the co-authors, along with \nfurther discussion with Argyle and further observations of his business in practice.  This re-\nanalysis, shaped by Argyles narrative analysis, by extant theory and by longitudinal \nobservations of Argyle and the firm, identified a small number of different processes that \nappeared to produce the reformulated business that emerged over time.  These processes, \nunder the acronym EROS (experiments, reflexivity, organising, sensitivity) are discussed \nbelow in relation to the case study and to extant theory. \n \nFindings and Analysis \n \nEnforced agility \nThe path of FlightDirectors appeared to be entirely composed of the disruptive effects \nof environmental changes to their contemporary way of doing business, a phenomenon \nArgyle later called \u201cenforced agility\u201d.  These included technology-mediated structural \nchanges in the industry, such as the shift to direct booking over the Internet, or quick-\nresponse to wider events, such as changes in flight cargo transport requirements to new areas \nfollowing the tsunami disaster in 2004.  This did not conform to established models for \nstrategic planning in the literature.  The directors did not appear to have the cognitive \nprescience that Schumpeter (1934) or Whitehead (1929) ascribe to successful organisations.  \nIt cannot be said that the business exemplified Pathfinding (Turner & Crawford, 1994) \ncompetences in its everyday approach to business.  It did not routinely or explicitly undertake \n 13\nformal foresight activities, such as scenario planning, it was not able to assess the \u201ctotal \nimpact of any particular change\u201d that strategic awareness assumes (Gibb & Scott, 1985).  Nor \nwas there evidence of the \u201chighly visible vision of the future\u201d that Hamel & Prahalad (1994) \nassociate with Strategic Intent. \nWhat the firm did was to repeatedly create new initiatives or projects, some of which \nsurvived to become distinct businesses and some of which did not.  In time, some of \nFlightDirector\u2019s experiments have become the \u201cfuture\u201d business, though it was not clear at \nthe time that they were established.  However, such instances do not fully explain the \nsustainability of the firm.  That sustainability is, we suggest, more bound up in the \ncommitment of the founders, in an existential way, to an ongoing interwoven life story of the \nfirm.  The motivation to survive and maintain this identity has been resilient to the huge \nenvironmental or systemic changes that the firm has experienced.  Sustainability has not been \nachieved through pure opportunism however.  While particular business units have been \ncreated on the basis of opportunities, the meaning of these opportunities has been interpreted \nwithin the overall coherent direction of the founders, which is to be independent and part of \nthe airline industry.   \n \nProcesses of Re-Creating the Business; Processes of Emergence  \nThe sustainability of the Flight Directors arises from the episodic production of new \npatterns; such as new identities, new services, new forms of organisation, new stakeholders.  \nThe emergent forms of order had precedent. The prescience of these changes was in the form \nof experimental behaviour and the sensing of a changing environment \u2013 often through \nrelationships with key informants, sometimes within their normal sphere of business and \nsometimes from an external source. The ordering of new patterns into day to day practice \n 14\ncame through an emergent realigned sense of identity and plausible working practices around \nan organising principle.   \nThese four inter-related processes (experiments, sensing, identity and ordering \npractice) and the empirical and theoretical bases for the framework are discussed below. \nExperimental behaviour  \nBaum (2003) notes the lack of empirical studies of experimentation among \nentrepreneurs, where rapid change is needed and information is poor.  This is an area that \nmight benefit from more empirical research, as we observed experimentation to be highly \nsignificant in the sustainability and development of the firm.  Experiments were observed as \na range of diverse exploratory behaviours at any one time in the firm.  Throughout Argyle\u2019s \nnarrative of the firm\u2019s history (Argyle, 2000) is the sense in which new things were being \ntried out, often in very informal ways.  There is a sense in which social interactions were \nused to search for and examine possibilities for new activities which might be formalised as \nexperimental projects if judged to hold promise.  If these worked, they were built upon.  If \nthey didn\u2019t work they were changed or dropped. \nThe projects or reorganising of activities were relatively small scale and were talked \nabout in terms of seeing what would work.  Each experiment had at its core an actor \u2013 either \na particular member of the management team or a particular customer or supplier.  Thus there \nis a sense of a shared experiential learning going on between these actors and the other \npeople involved; assembling and legitimising practices.  Two examples of \u2018experimentation\u2019 \nare (i) the approaches to responsibilities of the management team and (ii) the introduction of \ncall centre division based on technologies well in advance of the industry.   \nWith regards to management, from at least 1993, and certainly from 1996 is evidence \nthat Argyle and his co-director saw themselves as providing the conditions for operational \nmanagement to create business.  By 2000 this had become more formal.  Argyle\u2019s description \n 15\nof this is \u201cNew ideas for businesses are conceived and allowed to be developed by teams \nwhich form around the new advocates of those ideas\u201d The process also engaged external \nstakeholders:  \u201cthe idea is developed, in theory or on a small scale, and then appropriate \npartners are found\u201d.  The outcome of one particular example of this, said Argyle, was that, \n\u201cThis division focuses [\u2026] on a new relationship with a large Spanish airline\u201d. \n \nThe second example, the introduction of call centre technology, is brought about by \nopening new dialogues with technology suppliers keen to support \u2018experiments\u2019 in the \nindustry.  The act of collaborating, in itself, was a further \u2018experiment\u2019.  The attitude towards \nthe testing of the process is articulated by Argyle, when he said:  \n \n\u201cThe business relationship with [supplier] is very special with this business partner \ninvesting effort and resources\u2026 This \u2018open-ness\u2019 to participation and help from \nexternal sources is a new characteristic of [the division] and the success or failure of \nthe experience \u2026 may well determine whether it [collaboration] becomes a \npermanent trait.\u201d    \n \nAll new projects described by Argyle shared two qualities, one was the \u2018lets see if it works\u2019 \napproach and the other was that they were created because of an anticipated need from the \nclose stakeholders.  Some experiments worked and some did not.  \n \nReflexive construction of identity \nThe significance of identity was observed from Argyle\u2019s narrative as ever changing \ndescriptions of self, the firm and the industry, in which were constituted motivations, roles, \ndaily practice and behavioural imperatives.  Reflexivity describes the process by which the \n 16\nindividual constantly assesses the relationship between \u2018knowledge\u2019 and the \u201cways of doing \nknowledge\u201d (Cal\u00e1s & Smircich 1992, p240).  Reflexivity links the cognitive domain of the \nindividual to their experienced environment which for the entrepreneur, includes the \neveryday practices of doing business with others.  Argyle, as shaper and decision maker \ninfluences the emergent structures of the firm and the context (Fuller & Lewis, 2003).   \nA continuous reflection on the identity of the firm and the self-identity of its owner(s) \nthrough the discourses within the business and with stakeholders was central to the direction \nand identity of the firm, as well as the entrepreneur.  Lounsbury & Glynn note (2001, p554) \nthat a key challenge for an entrepreneurial firm is \u201cto establish a unique identity that is \nneither ambiguous nor unfamiliar, but legitimate\u201d. Downing (2005) goes further, suggesting \nthat individual, collective and organisational identities are co-produced over time through \nnarrative and dramatic processes.  For Stacey (2003, p. 319), strategy is the evolving patterns \nof an organisation\u2019s identity.  Thus, an inability to reshape organisational identity puts the \nfuture at risk for the firm.  This does not mean that the FlightDirectors was chameleon-like, \nable or willing to change their more fundamental values.  Paradoxically, it was the \nunderlying strength and continuity of the basic values and self-identity of the founders that \nsustained FlightDirectors Limited through the various manifestations of the firm.  For a small \nfirm, the entrepreneur is more central and hence we have found that their sense of self-\nidentity is more directional and indeed more significant than for a manager in a larger \norganisation.  The close identity of Argyle and his fellow founder to the airline industry has \nmaintained the business when it might otherwise have ceased to exist.   \nThere are two constant themes in the historical analysis of the case.  The first is the \nArgyle\u2019s sense of being something in the Airline industry \u2013 an enduring sense of self-identity \nwhich is also manifest in the internal discourses of the management team.  Second, a constant \nre-appraisal both of Argyle\u2019s role and also just what the business was, in relation to the \n 17\nindustry.  Argyle mentions working in his garage when the business first started, and how he \nsymbolically separated leisure-time and work-time \u201cby putting on a suit each morning and \nremoving in at the end of the working day\u201d and at the time \u201cThe Founder [Argyle] was the \nsalesman\u201d.  Much later in the life of the business Argyle sees himself as \u201cchairman\u201d, \nstepping back to let other \u201cgrab contracts\u201d.  The business itself is described as a broker, then \nan agency, then a service company, then two different kinds of business, then one kind of \nbusiness again\u2026 and continues to change. These descriptions fitting a broad idea of what it \nactually does as its business opportunities unfold into daily practice.   \n \nOrganising Domains \nAn organising domain is a space where activities are organised around a dominant \nlogic.  Lichtenstein links activity domains, which \u201cguide organizational activity and also \nprescribe limits to the system's capacity to get the work done\u201d with \u201corganizing domains,\u201d \nwhich in his studies of successful young businesses emerged rapidly in a self-organizing \nprocess, e.g.  \u201cOnce agreement for a new mission had been reached, a new set of organizing \ndomains rapidly emerged to implement that goal\u201d (Lichtenstein 2000c, p 128).  The idea of \nwhat constitutes an organising domain is not developed further by Lichtenstein.  It seems to \nus that organising domains produce observable everyday practices and that this production is \na process of social construction.  That is to say, as people unite their activities around a \ndominant logic, a pattern is established by virtue of negotiated activities between those \ninvolved.  \nLichtenstein (2000b) shows how in each of four high technology business start-ups \nthe business model had to be changed several times before becoming stable, not because a \nparticular pattern was unstable per se, but because it was designed relative to an unstable and \nunpredictable environment.  The reshaped behaviour pattern of the enterprise is, according to \n 18\nLichtenstein, an \u201cemergence from a process of self-organizing\u201d that created repeating and \namplified behaviours around the \u201cdominant logic\u201d.  Stacey too argues for the importance of \nself-organising (Stacey, 2003, p 332-333): complex understandings of organisational life \nrequires that managers are viewed (and view themselves) as participants in self-organising \nprocesses where conditions enable and constrain the interactions between agents in the \nsystem.  Stacey also notes that the organising that leads to the emergence of novelty is not the \nprovince of separate individuals on their own, but an overall pattern of relationships that is \norganising, the system and its agents emerging together in a reflexive manner, \nsimultaneously constraining and being constrained by each other in contexts where narratives \nand power relations form the \u2018dominant logic\u2019, that is, the analogues of attractors in Complex \nAdaptive Systems (CAS) terms.   \nWithin the narrative history of FlightDirectors are several examples of reorganising \nthe firm.  In each case, there is first a sense of interpretation of a changed situation followed \nimmediately by a conclusion about the necessary form of the business.  For example, in the \nearly days of the business is the phrase \u201cwe only had one customer left, so we decided to \nconcentrate on him\u201d.  Later in the history, after another downturn, Argyle records: \u201cthe \ndifference between the current state and more desirable state was a vastly slimmed down \nbusiness, fewer people, fewer transactions, less office space, less management\u2026\u201d.  And later \nstill (in a more successful period) \u201cReturning to profitability owed more to the internal mood \nrather than any external event or trend\u201d.   \nAfter Fuller (1999), Argyle learnt during the period of the study, to use the idea of an \n\u2018attractor\u2019 to understand and establish new scenarios in response to environmental threat and \nopportunity.  After a crisis, the business would reform around sets of personal commitments \nand new practices, which would become entrenched and amplified through relationships with \nstakeholders and formalisation of internal social processes such as business plans, titles and \n 19\nphysical locations.  Patterns tended to emerge around leaders in the organisation, as the need \narose to build a new \u2018attractor\u2019, that is a match between new internal projects and external \nexpectations (of customers, suppliers, and at the industry level, new trends and standards. \nEfficiency is often attained through regularity of practice.  In volatile or high velocity \nlandscapes in particular, the speed at which new regularised practices can be put into place \ncontributes to the sustainability of the enterprise.  The tension between innovative (pattern \nbreaking) practices and recurrent practices (maintaining patterns) requires managerial \njudgement.  The space of an organising domain involves discourses between individuals in \norder to constitute efficient practices, and is shaped by the effectiveness of those practices in \nrelation to the competitive landscape and in particular by its resonance with stakeholders.  It \nis thus formed across the levels of the model in but is constituted through the inter-\nconnections of identity, skills and motivations, task efficiency and meaning or value in \nrelationships both internally and externally.  The wider industry environment too, acts as a \nsource of both opportunity and constraint. \n \nSensitivity to conditions \nAn observable outcome of a firm\u2019s or individual\u2019s sensitivity to conditions is a \npropensity to reshape their relationship with the salient actors.  We see this as inherent to a \nprocess of emergence, in that the interpretation and perception of differences in the landscape \nprovides both meaning and imperatives to organising activities.  From this particular case \nstudy we note two significant aspects of sensitivity: (i) the threshold of unplanned change \n(internal or external to the firm) that triggers a reorganisation of activities (change in \nregularities) (ii) the timing of the instigation of breaks to regularities.  The first of these \nimplies that the capability to detect difference is a significant competence.  The second \naspect concerns the relative imperative (motivation or incentive) to change, which we \n 20\nsuggest may account for the threshold at which change is triggered and the rate at which it \ntakes place.  These two aspects elaborate the \u2018critical value\u2019 metaphor drawn by McKelvey \n(1999b) from the natural sciences (B\u00e9nard cell), and Lichtenstein\u2019s description of threshold \nevents. \nIn this particular case, the evidence of \u2018sensitivity to conditions\u2019 came from Argyle\u2019s \naccounts of the periods of transition or bifurcation.  In particular, the management team\u2019s \nawareness of changes in the environment and in the business itself, and their own translation \nof this awareness into acting, i.e. what it was that made them change.  The evidence suggests \nthat the management were highly aware of changes in the external environment and also of \nthe cash-flow and profitability produced by the business model.  The main issue for this \nbusiness seemed to be mainly one of enacting new patterns, and more particularly breaking \nexisting ones.  As the business became more established it seemed to take longer for such \ndecisions to be enacted.  For example with hindsight in 2000 the Financial Director said of a \nperiod in 1993 \u201cEverything was beginning to unravel, there were so many things we should \nhave done\u2026\u201d while Argyle reports of the same period, \u2018The consensus at a number of Board \nmeetings, and as discussed openly within the company, was that sooner or later the \norganisation needed to radically review its future strategy if it was going to survive.  The \ndecision to do this was not reached for six months.\u2019  The way in which changes were \ninterpreted and the clarity of a desired future (vision) made a difference to the emergence of \nnew regularities of practice. \n \nInter-connectedness of processes of emergence \u2013 an entrepreneurial mechanism \nFour processes (EROS) are identified above that interact to produce new emergent \nstructures, such as a new organisational structure (changes in the responsibilities of the \nmanagement team) or a new corporate venture (the new call centre).  In this case the \n 21\ninfluence of the individual entrepreneur (Argyle) on the shape of the business through its life \nis significant.  This shaping takes place in a social context of relationships with colleagues, \ncustomers and other stakeholders, all within the landscape of the airline industry. The \ncentrality of the relationship between an individual and their environment in these processes \nleads us to argue that this explanation is synonymous with accepted notions of \nentrepreneurship.  That is, where a particular individual is seen as central to the explanation \nof the organisational practices that are formed.   \nAlthough the above four processes of emergence (experiments, reflexivity, organising \nand sensitivity) are described distinctively from one another, it is evident that they are inter-\nrelated.  For example, the formation of experiments can have strong aspects of identity and \nvision attached to their inception, (and vice versa).  Similarly the motivation to change and \nthe interpretation of environmental signals are informed by the power of existing organising \ndomains and self-identity.  There are also inherent tensions between the processes, for \nexample between the ordering of practice and the flexibility of experimentation.  Such \ntensions are not polarised, and can be understood as part of a dialectical production of \noutcomes.  Taken in totality, these four areas of process provide an entrepreneurial \nmechanism, i.e. a set of processes that together produce novel and emergent structures.   \n \nDiscussion: Complexity and Entrepreneurship, Theory and Practice \n \nEROS as an Entrepreneurial Mechanism; Emergence in Multiple Ontologies \nThe EROS model reveals processes of the emergence of novelty, which is at the heart \nof entrepreneurship: evolving entrepreneurial and organisational identities, new management \nstructures and organisational forms, and a new corporate venture.  Like Lichtenstein et al \n(2007), we emphasise the importance of interdependent patterns of behaviour resulting in \n 22\n(re)organisations and novel structures at critical junctures in the firm\u2019s trajectory, rather than \nlinear sequences of individual acts.   \nWhat emerges from the (EROS) processes can be identified at more than one \nontological level.  A simple example of empirical ontologies in entrepreneurship might be the \nindividual, the firm and the network.  Analytical ontologies include psychological, social, \nbehavioural and economic.  For example, experimentation takes place at the cognitive level \n(thought experiments), behavioural (trial and error), relational (joint ventures); identities can \nbe formed at the personal, organisational or inter-organisational level (e.g. communities of \npractice); organising domains and sensitivity to change are also processes that transcend \nparticular disciplinary and empirical ontologies.  Each process inter-relates with others \nthrough multiple ontologies.  For example, a thought experiment, might be discussed with \ncolleagues, and then with someone in the network, resulting in the construction of an idea \nupon which some action is taken \u2013 i.e. experimentation and identity creation transcending \ndisciplinary domains in the process of the emergence of a new venture.  Overall, the \nemergent pattern forms what, in complexity parlance, is called an \u201cattractor\u201d. .   \nThis characteristic of the same general processes at different but related ontologies, \nleads us to consider that the processes have a global significance, i.e. that they might also \nhelp to understand emergent properties at other levels in which the owner and firm are \nsituated.  Taken in totality, these four areas of process provide an entrepreneurial mechanism, \ni.e. a set of processes that together produce novel and emergent structures.  The mechanism \nconceived thus transcends theories bound in disciplinary ontologies.  Thus while managerial \npractices instantiate these processes in any particular context, awareness of the power and \nnecessity of the general set of processes provides guidance for strategic action at multiple \nlevels and in coherently inter-connected processes.   \n \n 23\nEROS and Management Competence \nOver the period of study, we have found that for FlightDirectors, EROS is linked to \nmanagerial competence in relation to the sustainability of the firm, and as such can provide \nthe basis for recommendations for management practice, that is, guidance on practices that \ngenerate and exploit novelty in organisations.  In our analysis the ability to maintain systemic \nfitness is a function of entrepreneurship expressed as: \n \n (a) the number and quality of experiments that deal with \u201cweak signals\u201d of opportunities  \n(b) the quality of reflexivity (the way that the conceptualisations of identity (entrepreneur \nand firm) are able to transcend external structural changes in the business environment) \n (c) the capacity to restructure patterns of behaviour around the dominant logic of the \norganising domains.   \n(d) the sensitivity of the entrepreneur to changes in business conditions and their willingness \nto act on their interpretations \n \nEach of these processes is discernible to the actor, is manageable and is an areas in \nwhich competence can be developed. \nIt is necessary then to not only understand and use EROS as a set of processes where \nmanagerial competence can be increased, but also to organise EROS around the concept of \nattractors.  The role of leadership embraces the building of consistency and value around \nemerging attractors.  While in general the concept of attractor might be considered weak in \nits normative sense, being descriptively morphological, it is much stronger when considered \nas a performative organising principle for the EROS processes at multiple levels.  The \nconstruction of identity, narratives, structures and patterns of behaviour formed on market-\n 24\nresonant principles is the construction of regularised performances, and hence an attractor \npattern.   \nWe suggest that our study contributes to managerial competence in three ways. The \nfirst is conceptual competence, derived from giving meaningful dimensions to abstract \nmetaphors of complexity.  The use of metaphor is both unavoidable and necessary for \nmanagement practice, and part of the \u201clinguistic turn\u201d (Burnes 2005) that accompanies \ncomplexity theory into managerial practice (Fuller and Moran 2000; Lissack 1997; Stacey \n2003).  The second is strategic competence, as the theory enables purposeful practice with \nthe goal of organisational sustainability to be designed and evaluated.  The third is reflexive \ncompetence, i.e. agility or foresight, through practices that turn external signals into internal \nstructures manifest as everyday activities.  \n \n5.  Further research and summary \nThe authors are tentative in putting forward this challenging set of ideas based on \nwhat appears to be one case study, which itself is highly reflexive in that the data is imbued \nwith the language of complexity theory.  However, the work has been through a number of \niterations and further work is in progress that appears to support the general direction.  There \nare a number of areas for further research; we suggest six major themes below.   \nOne strong test of the normative value of the work will be the extent to which \nentrepreneurs find the model and the ideas behind it of value in their everyday management \nof sustainability.  To this end, action research in entrepreneurial reflexivity, engaging with a \nvariety of entrepreneurs is necessary.  Secondly, the case reported is based on an established \nSME.  Given the generic claim for the model with regards to the emergence of new ventures, \nthe processes need to be investigated in other entrepreneurial contexts, i.e. the effect of \nvariety.  For example, what meaning or resonance do they have in relation to start-ups or to \n 25\ncorporate venturing?  Thirdly, the concept of emergence itself, and the underlying ideas of \nless teleological causes, as inherent in theories of becoming or effectuation needs further \nconceptual and theoretical development.  Fourthly is the idea which emerged in reviews of \nthis article of the fractal relationship of similar processes at different ontological levels.  This \nrequires greater attention to the inter-relationships between ontologies encompassed by the \nentrepreneurship literature.  Fifthly our data indicates that part of the story of the emergence \nof novelty is the role of external sources play in developing \u2018new combinations\u2019 i.e. the use \nof cross-over from existing structures to new structures, or to new stakeholders or to \nassimilate knowledge which is non standard to the industry.  As a source of experimentation \nand sensitivity to conditions, resources used from outside the everyday experience or \nrelationships of the firm to produce emergence needs further investigation.  .  Finally, \ninherent in analyses of reflexivity, variety, emergence, effectuation, cross-over, co-evolution, \netc. are the creative powers of tensions and sensing, which could be further researched in \nentrepreneurial contexts. \nIn this article we have explained entrepreneurship as producing the emergence of \nnovelty through processes acting across multiple levels of analysis.  Drawing on complexity \ntheory, we have provided explanatory theory of an entrepreneurial mechanism.  We have also \noffered suggestions to improve management competence in entrepreneurial small firms that \nis centred on the entrepreneur, considers the relationships of the stakeholder environment and \nconsiders how strategy emerges in uncertain and unpredictable environments.  In doing so, \nwe have bridged the literatures on foresight and strategy in the entrepreneurship domain and \nprovided knowledge of the way that entrepreneurs can translate their relationship with the \nenvironment into a sustainable organisational performance. \n \n \n 26\nReferences \nAldrich, H.E. & Martinez, M.A. (2001).
