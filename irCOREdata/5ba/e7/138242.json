Introduction \nThe technique outlined in this paper is based on a process variously referred to as \n\u2018electric-field structuring\u2019 [1] or \u2018dielectrophoretic assembly\u2019 [2]. In this process, a \ndispersion of filler particles in a liquid polymer or pre-polymer is exposed to a \nmoderate a.c. electric field. Under suitable conditions, the filler particles become \npolarised and exhibit a mutually attractive force, which causes them to form chain-\nlike structures between the electrodes. The liquid can then be solidified by means of a \nchemical reaction or a change in temperature and the newly-formed structures fixed in \nplace to form a composite material with anisotropic properties. This method has the \npotential advantage that materials having the directionality of 1-3 type composites (an \narray continuous rods in a 3D matrix) could be made, whilst retaining the simplicity \nof 0-3 (randomly dispersed) manufacturing [3]. Recently it has been suggested that \nthis could be exploited to produce nano-scale conductors (nanowires) [4]. \n \nIn operation, the \u2018electric-field structuring\u2019 technique exploits the dielectrophoretic \nforce, which is responsible for the electrorheological effect [5-9]. It can be modelled \nin terms of: a) the dielectrophoretic or polarisation force, which is directed to produce \nthe desired particle structure; b) viscous drag in the fluid, which resists particle \nmotion; and c) settling or sedimentation of the polarised material, which must be \ncontrolled. Alternating electric fields are used, by preference, to suppress \nelectrophoresis. Applied electric-field strength is deliberately moderated to preclude \nsuch effects as electrically-induced turbulence in the fluid and accelerated curing of \nthe fluid pre-polymer. The frequency of the applied electric field is dictated by the \ndielectric properties of the fluid and the filler. It can be determined through \nconsideration of the complex polarisability parameter by the method outlined in [10]. \n \nOne of the major pitfalls associated with the electric-field structuring technique is \nsedimentation. When particles of the filler component have a higher density than that \nof the surrounding fluid they will tend to fall out of suspension under the influence of \ngravity. The rate of sedimentation depends on particle size and shape and also on the \nviscosity of the surrounding fluid. In practice, the dielectrophoretic force can be \narranged to overshadow viscous drag and also the effect of gravity. However, the \nforces acting on different sized particles are not of the same magnitude. This makes \nprecise control over the shape of the electric-field-induced structures difficult and \nirregularities commonly occur. A further difficulty concerns the viscosity of the \nsurrounding fluid, which is not constant over the course of the processing cycle. For \nexample, thermosetting polymers such as epoxy resins exhibit a progressive increase \nin viscosity with time as polymerisation proceeds. At the same time, the \npolymerisation reaction itself is exothermic and heat is generated. The fluid \nexperiences a rise in temperature and consequently its viscosity decreases. \nFurthermore, the rate of reaction is increased at the higher temperature. These \ncompeting effects make precise control over fluid viscosity difficult to achieve.  \n \n2. Experimental \nDirect visual observations of low volume-fraction suspensions subject to an applied \nelectric field can yield valuable information in the current context. In particular, direct \nobservation is used here to study the influence that applied field strength and \n 3\nfrequency has on structure formation. The potential difference applied across a curing \nsuspension is one of the more readily controllable parameters in the field structuring \ntechnique, and tailoring the applied waveform opens up a wide range of possibilities.  \nObservations were made of low volume fraction (2%) suspensions of lead titanate \npowder in an epoxy resin, as they cured under the influence of an electric field.  The \neffect of applied field strength and applied field frequency on the ceramic particle \ndistribution was recorded. In a separate experiment the dielectric spectra of an epoxy \nresin and of several suspensions of lead titanate (\u2264 40% vol.) in the resin were \nmeasured as they cured. The relative importance of cure temperature and ceramic \nvolume fraction was explored. The results of the two experiments were correlated to \nexplain the observed electro-kinetic behaviour. Optimum process parameters were \nidentified and were used to produce a range of electric-field structured composite \nmaterials. \n \n2.1 Powder Preparation \nHigh purity lead titanate (PT) was prepared by solid phase reaction of lead oxide \n(Aldrich: PbO <10\u00b5m, 99.9%+) and titanium dioxide (Aldrich, TiO2 325 mesh, \n99%min.) in molar quantities of 11:10. The addition of 10% excess lead oxide in this \nway was found by experiment to produce a powder with a narrow particle size \ndistribution. The oxides were first ball-milled in acetone for 4hrs using zirconia \nelements, then dried and formed into 5g pellets by holding at a pressure of 20MPa for \n5mins. The pellets were fired at 800\u00b0C for 2hrs and immediately pulverized by \nquenching in distilled water at room temperature. The powder so formed was etched \nin a solution of nine parts distilled water to one part concentrated nitric acid at 80\u00b0C \nfor 1hr using an etchant to powder ratio of 25ml\/g. The effect of this was two-fold. \nFirstly, excess lead oxide was removed from the surface and this was confirmed by x-\nray diffraction. Sharp facets and surface damage were also removed and nano-sized \nparticles were completely dissolved (Figure 1). The yield for the process was 82% by \nweight. The particle-size distribution was inspected using an X-ray Sedigraph and was \nfound to be very narrow, with ~96% of particles in the range 2-8\u00b5m equivalent \nspherical diameter. Density was measured by pycnometry as 7.771kg\/m3.  \n \n2.2 Epoxy Resin \nAn optically clear, low conductivity epoxy resin (Epotek 302-3M - Epoxy \nTechnology Inc., Billerica Ma.) was selected for the experiments. This is a two \ncomponent fluid system. The epoxy pre-polymer is based on diglycidyl ether of \nbisphenol-A (DGEBA) and the curing agent is based on the multi-functional aliphatic \namine, poly(oxypropyl)-diamine (POPD). Both parts of Epotek 302-3M are clear \nliquids at room temperature. The viscosity of the resin was measured using a \nrotational viscometer (Contraves Rheomat 115) as 2.48Pas immediately after mixing \nat 20\u00b0C. The initial viscosity is relatively high for a commercial epoxy resin and this \nis an advantage in the current context as it serves to inhibit sedimentation of the dense \nceramic powder. The glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg) of the resin is 52\u00b0C \nwhen cured at 65\u00b0C for 90mins. Post-curing the resin at 150\u00b0C for 1hr. raises Tg to \n96\u00b0C. Refractive index is given as 1.5340 and transmission of light at optical \nfrequencies is >96%. Figure 2 shows isoviscosity curves for Epotek 302-3M \nmeasured over a range of cure temperatures. \n 4\n \n2.3 Direct visual observations \nDirect visual observations of electrically induced structure formation in low volume-\nfraction (2%) suspensions of lead titanate powder in a curing epoxy resin pre-polymer \nwere made using an optical microscope. The suspensions were held in a shallow glass \ncell which was purpose made for the experiment. The resin was first degassed under \nvacuum at 50\u00b0C for 1 hour, the powder was added and the suspension degassed for a \nfurther 1 hour. The curing agent was added and thoroughly stirred before being \nintroduced to the cell. An alternating electric field was applied between parallel \ncopper plates set 2mm apart, using a Trek 610C High Voltage Power Amplifier in \nconjunction with a signal generator (Thurlby Thandor TG501). The influence of \napplied voltage was examined in the frequency range 0-5kHz as the resin cured at \nroom temperature. The suspensions were randomised by stirring between observations \nto ensure that they did not retain a \u2018history\u2019 of previous processing conditions. The \nexperiment was subsequently repeated using lead titanate powder which had been \nvacuum-dried for 24hrs at 100\u00b0C. \n \n2.4 Dielectric cure monitoring \nBy measuring the frequency dependence of complex permittivity (\u03b5*) it is possible to \nseparate out and monitor parameters governing both ionic and dipolar mobility in the \ncuring resin and suspensions. A 4g sample of each fluid, in a glass test-tube, was \nplaced in a temperature-controlled cell. An interdigitated, fringing-field type \ncapacitive sensor (Dek-Dyne) was positioned in the fluid and an a.c. signal voltage \napplied using an impedance analyser (Solartron SI1260 Gain-Phase). The resulting \ncurrent was compared to the applied voltage in respect of amplitude ratio and phase \ndifference. The impedance analyser scanned twenty-six individual frequencies, in the \nrange 10Hz - 1MHz, each sweep taking 30s. The data was recorded automatically and \nwas used to deduce relative permittivity and dielectric loss. The fringing field of the \ncapacitive sensor penetrates 25\u00b5m into the fluid making it suitable for both the resin \nand suspensions. Measurements were made on the curing resin and a range of \nsuspensions (to 40% vol.) of dry lead titanate in the resin as they slow cured at 40\u02daC. \nIn all cases measurements began 5 minutes after initial mixing. \n \ne) Fabrication of model composites \nStructured lead titanate-epoxy resin composites were prepared according to the \nfollowing method. A dispersion of known ceramic volume fraction was made up for \neach sample. This was divided into two identical parts. One part was processed by \nfield-structuring between two charged copper electrodes. The other was \nsimultaneously put through an identical thermal cycle but with no field applied. The \nmethod by which the processing conditions were derived is outlined below (Section \n3). After curing, a layer of material adjacent to each electrode was skimmed off to a \ndepth of 250\u00b5m as a precaution against a build-up of impurities in that area. The \ndensity of each sample was measured by the Archimedes method and the volume \nfraction of the ceramic was re-calculated. This step was felt necessary to ensure that \nsedimentation had not caused the actual composition to drift away from its nominal \nvalue during processing. The composites were sectioned, using an annular saw both \nperpendicular and parallel to the applied field. Similar sections were made from the \n 5\nunstructured composites. The specimens were furnished with electrodes using air-\ndrying silver paint. A 1mm perimeter, around the edge of each specimen, was left \nexposed in order to minimise the influence of the fringing field. Dielectric \nmeasurements were made using a GenRad 1689M RLC Digibridge. Transmission \nlight microscopy was used to reveal the chained microstructure in low volume \nfraction composites as illustrated in Figure 3. \n \n3. Results and Discussion \n \n3.1 Visual observations \nThe electrically-induced patterns that were observed to form in the suspensions can be \nconveniently described in terms of the structure-types illustrated in Figure 4. Type I is \ncharacterized by a large number of randomly positioned short chains consisting of \nonly a few particles. These are aligned with the applied field. Type II consists of \nsingle strand \u2018pearl-chains\u2019 which completely span the inter-electrode gap indicating a \nstronger dielectrophoretic attractive force. Some of these may be branched. In Type \nIII the individual chains have been drawn together and have coalesced to form more \nsubstantial \u2018columnar\u2019 structures. \n \nFigure 5 shows the observed behaviour at different applied field strengths and \nfrequencies when untreated particles are used. The experiment was repeated, as shown \nin Figure 6, using particles which have been vacuum-dried to remove adsorbed \nmoisture. \n \nRefering to Figure 5. At 250 V\/mm the field strength is sufficient for structuring to \ntake place but initially, at all frequencies, significant electrohydrodynamic flow of the \nfluid prevents full chains from forming. The dielectric properties of the fluid change \nas curing progresses and after 30 minutes full chaining becomes possible at higher \nfrequencies (\u22653kHz). At 500 V\/mm fluid flow is initially violent which precludes any \nstructure formation. At the higher frequencies (\u22652kHz) the field strength is such that \nfull chaining is observed despite significant fluid flow. After 30 minutes, fluid flow \nsubsides at ~4kHz and chaining readily occurs. NB: After 40 minutes violent \nstreaming returned at the higher frequencies. This was ascribed to exothermic heating, \nleading to a temporary reduction in viscosity and hence increased mobility of charged \nspecies. Full chains formed rapidly and were immediately disrupted. After one hour \nunder these conditions bubbles started to form in the resin and foaming ensued. The \nlead titanate particles clearly exhibited electrophoresis at lower frequencies. At 1000 \nV\/mm electrical breakdown occurred initially at all frequencies. Some evidence of \nchaining, at 4kHz, was observed after 30 minutes. \n \nFigure 6 demonstrates the changes that occur when using lead titanate powder which \nhas been scrupulously dried. Chains are seen to form much more readily and, again, \nthis is initially favoured at the higher frequencies. Overall, it can be seen that fluid \nflow is substantially diminished and the chains that form as a consequence of \npolarization are disrupted to a lesser extent. The presence of adsorbed moisture \nwould, therefore, seem to be an important factor to consider when defining process \nparameters. It could be that the effect of drying is twofold. Clearly, by removing \n 6\nabsorbed moisture the total number of charged ions is reduced. In addition, a number \nof reactive sites on the particle surfaces become available and ionic species may be \nadsorbed, thereby further reducing the number of free ions in the fluid. In the light of \nthe above findings, the highest field strength (1000V\/mm) was omitted for this \nexperiment. After 30 minutes a slight increase in fluid flow was observed at 1kHz and \nthis is again explained by an observed increase in temperature due to the reaction \nexotherm. Curing progressed in this case without the occurrence of excessive \nbubbling. \n \nFigure 7 illustrates the measured dielectric loss of Epotek 302-3M at 20\u00baC alongside \nthe observed frequency dependence of streaming due to electrohydrodynamic (EHD) \nflow. The measurements were taken 5 minutes after curing began. Analysis shows \nthat in the frequency range 102-105 Hz a plot of log(\u03b5\u201d) v - log(f) has a slope of very \nclose 1. The dominant role of ionic conduction at these frequencies is thereby \nconfirmed.  \nWith reference to Figure 6. At 250V\/mm there is a clear reduction in EHD flow which \noccurs between 0.5kHz and 1kHz. At 500V\/mm, the same change is seen between \n2kHz and 3kHz. The significance of this is apparent on the dielectric loss curve \n(Figure 7), as it corresponds to a range where, due to relaxation, the loss approaches \nits high frequency value. Such behaviour provides clear evidence that ionic \nconductivity in the fluid is predominant in the early stages of cure and in general it \ncan be said that: 1) the abatement of streaming is at a higher frequency at the higher \nfield strength and 2) that as time passes streaming occurs at progressively lower \nfrequencies.  \n3.2 Dielectric cure monitoring \nA more complete data set is available for the resin and suspensions curing at 40\u00b0C and \nthe results of cure monitoring are reproduced below as Figure 8. These plots show the \ninitial low frequency spike that is indicative of electrode polarization, which appears \nstronger for the 40% vol. lead titanate in comparison with the resin itself. An \ninflection in the curves at high frequency (log f = 6) is seen after curing for 1 hour \nand, as time goes on, this moves to progressively lower frequencies. This marks the \nonset of gelation in the resin. Figure 9 shows the initial values and the changes that \nhave occurred after 1 hour. Note that measurements relating to a suspension of 10% \nvol. lead titanate are little different from those of the resin alone. The effect of raising \nthe temperature is twofold. Firstly, at a given field strength, a higher field frequency is \nrequired to suppress EHD flow because of increased charge mobility. However, the \nreduced viscosity of the fluid will ensure that chaining is possible at lower field \nstrengths. This is significant because the viscous drag force scales linearly with \nviscosity, whereas the polarization force scales quadratically with applied field \nstrength. Further work would be required to find exactly where the applied field \nstrength exceeds the threshold for chain formation and the corresponding field \nfrequency at which EHD flow is suppressed. \n \nThe above findings can be related to established theory and an important factor to \nconsider is the frequency dependence of the polarizability parameter. Figure 10 shows \ncollected data and calculated values of the polarizability parameter in its complex \n 7\nform; it having a real part referred to as Re[f(\u03b5*)] and an imaginary part Im[f(\u03b5*)] \n[10]. The ideal, perfect dielectric, form of the polarizability parameter (\u03b2) is also \ncalculated for comparison. The plots show that the Re [f (\u03b5*)] mirrors the form of the \ninitial relative permittivity curve for the resin. The Im [f (\u03b5*)] on the other hand \nmirrors the corresponding dielectric loss curve. Interestingly, because (\u03b5p - \u03b5f ) and (\u03c3p \n- \u03c3f) have opposite signs, the function Re [f (\u03b5*)] passes through zero. This occurs at \n\u22481kHz and consequently the dielectrophoretic force is zero at this frequency. Below it \nthe particles experience negative dielectrophoresis and above it positive \ndielectrophoresis. Given that the interparticle forces scale according to (\u03b2)2, the point \nat which the traces of Re [f (\u03b5*)] and Im [f (\u03b5*)] cross, ~2.5kHz, may prove to mark a \nlower limit for composite assembly. Clearly, the ideal value of beta (\u03b2), quoted in \nsome research papers, does not appear to be a true indicator of dielectrophoretic \nbehaviour below c.10kHz.  \n \nBenguigui and Lin [11] showed through calculation that the frequency dependence of \nthe dielectrophoretic force is divided into a dielectric regime and a conductivity \nregime. The dielectric regime exists where t<< \u03c4 for the d.c. case or where \u03c9.\u03c4 >>1 \nfor the a.c. case (where \u03c4 is the Maxwell-Wagner time constant (\u03b5p + 2\u03b5f )\/(\u03c3p + 2\u03c3f)). \nThe dielectrophoretic force then depends only on the mismatch in the dielectric \nconstants of the two components. The conductivity regime is defined by t >> \u03c4 for d.c. \nand \u03c9.\u03c4 << 1 for a.c. The dielectrophoretic force is then defined by the difference in \ntheir respective conductivities. Figure 11 shows the frequency dependence of \u03c9.\u03c4  \nThis indicates that the point where \u03c9.\u03c4 = 1, marking the transition between the two \nregimes, occurs at 1290Hz. For the case in point, this is identical to the frequency at \nwhich Re [f (\u03b5*) ] = 0 and the calculation is somewhat simpler. Structure formation in \nseen to occur when 1< \u03c9.\u03c4 <2 and this may represent an alternative assessment of \nparticle polarizability when processing parameters are defined. \n \n3.3 Processing parameters for composite assembly \nThe chief processing variables that must be defined for structuring to take place are: \na) time scale; b) temperature; c) electric field strength and d) electric field frequency. \nIn particular, it is essential to identify the field strength - frequency relationship, \nwhich highlights the onset of significant EHD flow. Given that the dielectric \nproperties of the fluid are predominant in the early stages of cure, this could be \ndetermined directly from measured conductivity or alternatively from log (viscosity), \nwhich has been shown to mirror the extent of conversion of the reactants over the \nrange in question [12]. Measurements would encompass a suitable range of \ntemperatures. On the side of caution, a question remains as to whether the parameters \nidentified in this way would reliably translate to very high volume fraction \nsuspensions, where interfacial effects may assume greater prominence. Furthermore, \nthere is a concern that measurements made under low field conditions may not \naccurately reflect high-field behaviour. For the purposes of this study it can be said \nthat suitable frequencies for composite assembly lie beyond the elbow in the dielectric \nloss curve and, in the absence of EHD flow, visual observations show that full \nchaining can occur at 250V\/mm. At 500V\/mm columns form readily indicating a \nsecond threshold has been passed. When establishing the processing time and \n 8\ntemperature, it should be recognized that sedimentation of the relatively heavy \nparticles must be avoided. A simple way to overcome this is to partially cure the resin \nand then re-mix to re-establish a uniform dispersion. It has been observed that the \nresin is still sufficiently fluid for structure formation to occur at 10Pas. Accordingly \nthe resin can be allowed to cure for 1 hour at room temperature. It is then re-stirred \nunder vacuum. The temperature is then raised to 35\u00baC for 45 minutes with a field of \n250V\/mm applied at 4kHz. The temperature is then raised to 55\u00baC for 45 minutes to \ncomplete the cure. A post-cure at 120\u00baC for 1 hour can be performed if required to \nraise Tg. The relative permittivities of a range of composites prepared in this way are \nshown in Figure 12 and these are compared to calculated values for the same system \nusing some standard models for di-phasic composites.  \n \nIn common with many composites, the interface between the filler and matrix \ncomponents has a controlling influence on the physical properties of materials \nproduced by electric-field structuring. The surface electrical properties of the filler \nparticles, in particular, are of prime importance. Normally particles are completely \nsurrounded by a layer of adsorbed polymer, giving true 0-3 type connectivity [3]. \nWhere these layers form insulating barriers between the particles, the useful electrical \nproperties of the composite material are adversely affected. Furthermore, where \nvariations in the sizes of individual particles exist, chain branching is found to occur. \nAnisotropy in the electrical properties will then be a function not only of ceramic \nloading, but also of the degree of chain branching [2]. In practice, some disparity in \nthe spatial distribution of the filler particles is found to occur between otherwise \nidentical composite samples. Hence, some variability in the physical properties of \npowder composites prepared by electric-field structuring can normally be expected.  \n \n4. Conclusion \nThe electric-field structuring technique has been explored for a model composite \nsystem and it has been demonstrated that it can be used to induce directional materials \nproperties. The main processing parameters have been explored and it has been \ndemonstrated that the dielectric properties of the fluid are of prime consideration in \nthe early stages of cure. Clearly electric-field structuring is a highly controllable, low \nenergy technique which could be used effectively to induce locally reinforced or \nfunctional-gradient materials. The technique is not restricted to the model composite \nsystem investigated here, but is applicable to a wide range of fluid\/filler combinations.  \n \n5.
