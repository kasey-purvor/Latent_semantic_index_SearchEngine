This paper explores the ways in which \nempowerment has been understood, defined and deployed by post-apartheid governments \nin the context of a gradual shift from nation-building to neo-liberal governance. It \nexamines the impact of legislation and government policy through a critical examination \nof empowerment initiatives in the wine industry. Drawing on research conducted in the \nWestern Cape in 2004, the paper analyses how empowerment is interpreted and \nappropriated both within legislation and specifically within the wine industry. It explores \nwhat the wine industry reveals about the disempowering work of neo-liberalism, even as \nit is couched in the discourses of empowerment. Findings suggest that equating \nempowerment with economic empowerment threatens to reinforce structures of \ndomination, rather than transforming them, while leaving power relations largely \nuntouched. The case study reveals that until more radical understandings of power and \nempowerment are acknowledged and incorporated into government policies the failure to \naddress broader issues of social and economic transformation will persist and policies \naimed at the empowerment of marginalised individuals and communities will continue to \nhave apparently pre-determined and depoliticized outcomes.  \n \nKey words \nEmpowerment, South Africa, neo-liberalism, wine industry, power, transformation \n 1\n(Re)politicizing empowerment: lessons from the South African wine industry \nIntroduction \nEmpowerment is currently at the heart of political and theoretical debate. People from \nacross the political spectrum claim to support \u2018empowerment\u2019 as part of the decentring of \ndecision-making power (Perkins et al. 1996; Rowlands 1997); it has become \u201ca popular, \nlargely unquestioned \u2018goal\u2019\u201d (Parpart 2002, p. 338). And yet, as it has been deployed in \npolitical and development discourses, it is a concept that is vague and poorly defined, \ncausing confusion over expectations and over the evaluation of progress and outcomes of \n\u2018empowerment\u2019 strategies or policies. Some argue that the concept enjoys universal \nappeal precisely because of its vagueness (Lyons et al. 2001; Sharp et al. 2003); it is \ndefined only loosely or by implication, in contrast with a state of \u2018disempowerment\u2019 \ntacitly assumed to have a generally accepted definition (Marshall 1998). Critics also \nsuggest that, where empowerment was once a subversive, emancipatory activist tool, it \nnow forms one of the building blocks of neo-liberal governance. As Miraftab (2004, p. \n239) argues, development agencies and governments have both depoliticised the concept, \nby appropriating it in such a way that negates its implications for dominance, and \ndeployed it in profoundly political ways to rationalise neo-liberal governance.1  \nEmpowerment strategies have arguably been nowhere more central to government \npolicy than in South Africa, both historically and in the present2, and nowhere are they \ncurrently more hotly debated and contested. Empowerment is seen as central to post-\napartheid nation-building and to the broader transformation from a racialised system of \ndiscrimination to one of greater political, social and economic equity. Quite what \nempowerment means, how it is to be fostered and how much it is achieved are, however, \n 2\nboth complex and contested. We wish to argue that the ways in which empowerment has \nbeen understood, defined and deployed by post-apartheid governments, and specifically \nthe ways in which it is has seemingly been reduced to economic empowerment, are in \ndanger of reinforcing structures of domination, rather than transforming them, while \nleaving power relations largely untouched.  \n The paper first explores conceptual arguments about power and empowerment as \nthey have unfolded in South African debates, legislation and policies. It focuses on the \ngradual shift from nation-building to neo-liberal governance and how this is reflected in \neconomic reductionism evident in concepts of empowerment. We argue that such a \nreductionism both depoliticises empowerment and potentially has disempowering effects. \nIn order to develop this argument, we explore the impact of legislation and government \npolicy through a critical examination of empowerment initiatives in the wine industry. \nAgribusiness was known to be particularly exploitative of black labour under apartheid \nand, because of its connections to issues of land restitution and workers rights, is of \nimmediate significance in socio-economic transformation and issues of empowerment.3 \nMoreover, a number of schemes have been implemented to transform the wine industry, \nwith several South African wines now being marketed explicitly at home and \ninternationally as \u2018empowerment\u2019 wines (Bek et al. 2006). South African case studies of \nthe wine industry and other agricultural sectors in the Western Cape have played an \nimportant role in contributing to broader debates around fair and ethical trade. In this \npaper we take a different approach in examining what the wine industry reveals of current \ndebates about empowerment and its appropriation by governments. We are interested in \nwhat empowerment means in this context, what the wine industry reveals about the \n 3\ndisempowering work of neo-liberalism, even as it is couched in the discourses of \nempowerment, but also what lessons might be learned about potential ways forward in re-\npoliticising empowerment. \nOur assessments are based on research conducted in the Western Cape in \nMarch\/April 2004. A wide range of informants involved in the wine industry were \ninterviewed, including producers, managers, government officials, consultants, \nrepresentatives of labour unions, employment and marketing associations and \nempowerment-focused wine industry bodies.4 We explore the contested meanings and \nimpacts of empowerment strategies, focusing on both industry-wide and grassroots \ninitiatives. South African policies are subject to intense debates and criticism, particularly \nfor their apparent failure to deliver broad-based emancipatory empowerment. To this end \nwe explore some of the complexities and contradictions of trying to effect broad-based \nempowerment within the context of unprotected free market globalisation and the \nimplications for conceptualising empowerment within this context. \n \nEmpowerment, neo-liberal governance and economic reductionism  \nNotions of empowerment in post-apartheid South Africa have been closely related to \nideas about democratization, conceived of through processes of state restructuring and \nincreasing participation in all spheres of life (Hill 2003). Through restructuring of the \nstate, institutions and legislation there has been a focus on increased equity in the \ndistribution of power as it relates to the articulation and satisfaction of needs, stressing \nlocal involvement and devolution of power (McEwan 2003). Empowerment is perceived \nas a facilitator for the attainment of rights and as central to the creation of participatory \n 4\ndemocracy, with emphasis on the role of self-organizing. Efforts towards socio-political \ntransformation have thus been based on sophisticated understandings of how power \noperates; as Fraser (1989, p. 26) argues, \u201cIf power is instantiated in mundane social \npractices and relations, then efforts to dismantle and transform the regime must address \nthose practices and relations\u201d. Following the initial period of refashioning state \nmachinery, focus has shifted towards these social practices and relations, recognising that \nchanges in ideology need to accompany the restructuring of decision-making hierarchies \nand that both need to occur in all spheres of life. Groups held back by \u201cstructures of \ncollective constraint\u201d (ibid. p. 135) based on gender, ethnicity, race, class, age or sexual \norientation have an especially strong stake in redistributing social power (see Folbre \n1994; Hill 2003). Thus participation in local democracy and decision-making is seen as \ncentral to the empowerment of previously oppressed groups in South Africa.  \nThis emphasis on participation as a means of empowering historically \ndisadvantaged groups is seen as a defining feature of the \u2018new\u2019 South Africa, linked \noriginally to strong grassroots structures that evolved during apartheid and to South \nAfrica\u2019s particular approach to development embodied in the Reconstruction and \nDevelopment Programme, which evolved from them. This involves decentralising control \nand decision-making to civil society and grassroots levels (Niksic 2004), creating self-\nawareness and the transformation of society, leading to negotiated power-sharing within a \nunified nation. On the one hand, this is a drive towards the \u201cself-organisation of the poor\u201d \n(Friedmann 1996, p. 162) in a co-operative manner as a means of gaining control over the \nmeans to a livelihood. On the other hand, this is also about transforming deeply \n 5\nembedded social and structural inequities and fostering individual and collective \nempowerment that is essential to social transformation. \nEmpowerment, as it is conceived of in South Africa, also requires broader \ninvolvement in economic and social processes, the nature of which determines practices \nand activities affecting the well-being and freedoms of people in society. \nDemocratization is aimed in part at extending more social power to those historically and \ncurrently disadvantaged in processes of social and economic choice; it has attempted to \ncreate a new knowledge and new values that bring about the meaningful empowerment of \ngroups relegated to subordinate positions. As discussed subsequently, achievements to \ndate are debated intensely (see also Bond 2000; Hart 2002; McEwan 2003) and often \nmeet resistance from those who were previously privileged by existing power relations \nand whose privileges in relation to power are threatened by transformation. The hope \nremains, however, that as democratization changes embedded institutions the base of \nsociety also changes; new understandings of social reality emerge, self-definitions are \naltered and institutional practices are modified (Hill 2003; Hill Collins 2000; Hartsock \n1998). As Hill (2003) argues, change begins when individuals who share a perception \nthat change is necessary or desirable initiate new practices; change is complete when the \nnew practice becomes the norm or the rule.  \n \nBlack economic empowerment \nMoral, legislative and economic imperatives have helped initiate and sustain processes of \nchange in South Africa. In recent years, however, there has been an increasingly \nconcentrated focus on empowerment as \u2018black economic empowerment\u2019 (hereafter \n 6\nBEE)5, defined as black people gaining access to corporate ownership and management \nroles that give them equal access to scarce resources (Murray 2000). At the ending of \napartheid, black workers expressed hope that the new government would empower them \nin the same way that the National Party empowered Afrikaners from 1948. Since 1994, \nANC governments have committed to fostering BEE through enabling the emergence of \na black middle (specifically entrepreneurial) class. Parastatals were given millions of \ndollars to support black empowerment and quotas were introduced into the public sector \nin an effort to combat inequities structured around gender, race and (dis)ability; there was \na shared belief that programmes of BEE would \u201csupport black business to enter the \nmainstream\u201d (Mabogoane 1995, p. 1) and that this would mean a transfer of black \nworkers into management positions. This policy, with its perceived long-term benefits for \nsocial stability and nation-building, was reiterated recently by President Mbeki: \nAs we approach the end of the first decade of our new democracy the need for an \neconomic transformation that brings about effective and significant black \neconomic empowerment becomes more pressing. We believe that it is in the \ninterests of all citizens that we succeed in this endeavour (Mbeki 2003). \nA black middle class is seen strategically as the vanguard for the integration of black \npeople into mainstream economy and black empowerment as central to fighting poverty \n(Iheduru 2004) and reducing the potential for civil strife. The long-stated and \ncontroversial aim of government policy is \u201cpatriotic capitalism to ensure that there \nemerges a black bourgeoisie\u201d (Mbeki 1999 in Murray 2000, p. 183). A class solution is \nthus sought to racialised inequities even as it fosters the creation of a capitalist economy; \nunsurprisingly, very few issues animate South Africans as do the politics of BEE. \n 7\nPrior to 2004, BEE strategies were scattered in various pieces of legislation, \nincluding the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act (2001), \nExtension of Security of Tenure Act (1997), Restitution of Land Rights Act (2003), and \nEmployment Equity Act (1998). The National Empowerment Fund Act (1998) sets aside \n2% of proceeds from privatisation of state assets in a trust to finance the purchase of \nequity stakes in these businesses by previously disadvantaged peoples (Iheduru 2004). \nSeveral apartheid-era laws pertaining to credit, usury and income tax have been reviewed \nand amended to remove impediments to effective black participation in mainstream \neconomy. Bidders for government contracts have to demonstrate a commitment to BEE. \nThe energy and mining sectors are heavily subsidised by the government, giving the latter \npowers to demand that white capital in these sectors embrace BEE or face liberalisation. \nThis threat also allowed the government to pass the Minerals and Petroleum \nDevelopment Act (2002), which returns private mineral rights to the state for the benefit \nof all South Africans. Other regulated areas of the economy (particularly advertising, \npublic relations and auto-manufacturing) have also adopted voluntary empowerment \nstrategies; for example, advertising has promised 26% black ownership and 40% black \nemployment to guarantee government contracts (Klein 2003). However, many critics \nclaim that despite legislation BEE strategies have been only partially implemented, if \nthey have been implemented at all. \nProfound scepticism remains concerning the impact of empowerment measures \nand BEE, in particular, has been subject to furious criticism. Murray (2000), for example, \nargues that the changes brought about have been minor and self-interested and amount to \nlittle more than a \u201ccorporate blackwash\u201d. She argues that BEE measures have been \n 8\nadopted by individual companies to combat an all-white management image, to improve \na company\u2019s black distribution network, to gain control of black workers\u2019 pension funds, \nto place responsibility for enforcing large-scale redundancies or crack-downs on worker \nmilitancy on black managers and to improve social stability generally. Moreover, \nThese black companies typically have small black stakes, with a titular male black \nhead operating within a majority white board whose members dominate decision-\nmaking (ibid. p. 184).  \nMeanwhile, white family capital continues to dominate big business and black poverty \nremains unchallenged by the few BEE companies and worker equity schemes that have \nemerged. Critics also point out that there is little reason to suspect BEE will accelerate \ngiven widespread corporate anxiety over declining global economic profits and the ANC \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to neo-liberal macro-economic policies, which are likely to \nstymie the emergence of a sizeable black middle class (Ramsamy 1996; Bond 1997; \nMurray 2000; Hart 2002). \nOur research and that of others suggests that many black people are ambivalent \nabout BEE and suspicious of self-interest amongst the small black elite that has emerged \nsince 1994. Macro-economic reforms have reduced the purchasing power of blacks and, \nin shrinking the state, have reduced the number and size of contracts needed to bolster \nBEE businesses leaving only corporations to support empowerment. As Murray (ibid. p. \n203) argues: \nBlack empowerment\u2026is a token corporate blackwash for there is nothing \npatriotic about capital \u2013 it knows no community, state or national loyalty \u2013 only \nthe incoherent march towards globalisation.  \n 9\nThe limited interpretation of BEE is symptomatic of non-inclusive consultation and a \nnarrow focus on the transfer of ownership of South African corporate entities (Heese \n2003). The reasons for this are reliance on government programmes (to create jobs, \ndevelop skills and education, and alleviate poverty) and the effect of black corporate \nlobby groups, resulting in criticisms of BEE as an \u2018enrichment\u2019 process, benefiting only a \nfew well-positioned individuals (Southall 2004). Critics argue that BEE has failed to \naddress transformation for a broad base of South Africans, may have deepened rather \nthan alleviated inequality, and the fostering of black corporate elite has had opportunity \ncosts for other stakeholders, especially the unemployed and rural poor. Statistics suggest \nthat polarisation of wealth has increased under ANC governments, with the richest 10% \nof black households gaining on average 17% between 1991 and 1996 and the poorest \n40% losing 21% (Barrell et al 2000, in Murray 2000, p. 186). Recent estimates show that \nthe proportion of people living in poverty has not changed much since the mid 1990s; in \n2001 it was estimated that 61% of Africans and 38% of coloureds were poor, compared \nto 5% of Indians and 1% of whites (Keller 2005). Continuing empowerment of a sector of \nthe population depends heavily on a commitment to empowering a large number of \nindividuals and to spreading information, training and opportunity. However, critics \nsuggest that ANC policies have allowed power to be hoarded by elites, do not meet \nbroad-based empowerment objectives and have led to stagnation within already \ndisempowered communities and groups (Lyons et al. 2001).  \nAware of these criticisms, the government passed the Broad-based Black \nEmpowerment Act in January 2004 aimed at: \n 10\n[T]he economic empowerment of all black people including women, workers, \nyouth, people with disabilities and people living in rural areas through diverse but \nintegrated socio-economic strategies. \n(http:\/\/www.info.gov.za\/gazette\/acts\/2003\/a53-03.pdf, accessed 31.01.05) \nStrategies include facilitating and increasing the number of black people (communities, \nworkers, cooperatives and other collectives) that manage, own and control enterprises \nand productive assets; human resource and skills development; achieving equitable \nrepresentation in all occupational categories and levels in the workforce; preferential \nprocurement; and investment in enterprises that are owned or managed by black people \n(http:\/\/www.info.gov.za\/gazette\/bills\/2003\/b27b-03.pdf, accessed 31.01.05). The Act also \nprovides for the establishment of the BEE Advisory Council to advise government, \nreview progress, advise on draft codes of good practice, and facilitate partnerships \nbetween state institutions and the private sector to advance BEE.  \nThe approach to BEE is expanded to encompass ownership, management, human \nresource development, procurement and \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment\u201d (ibid.), using a \nscorecard approach to set targets that can then be measured in each of these areas. \nAccording to the DTI, certain sectors and industries will be required to comply with the \nterms of the Act by developing sector charters, whereas other sectors will voluntarily \ndevelop their own charters (Hendricks 2004) to outline issues and targets for effective \ntransformation. The most fundamental principle is that BEE must be broad-based and \nensure that larger numbers of people benefit rather than enriching an elite few. However, \nthe Act has been criticised from all sides, by angry black business about to lose some of \nits patronage, by white business allegedly tired of paying \u2018blood money\u2019 and by a \n 11\ndisillusioned and vocal left in the governing alliance. Powerful black business leaders \ncriticize it as a backward step since it places emphasis on a black-white compact and a \nprinciple of mutual reliance. In response, the government has attacked \u2018elitist\u2019 black \ncapitalists, whom it accuses of \u2018scaring away\u2019 foreign investment and not doing enough \nto spread the benefits of BEE to the black majority (Iheduru 2004).  \n \nEmpowerment and power \nHow power is defined and understood is critical to assessing the success of BEE because \ndiffering definitions of power underpin different understandings of empowerment. The \nmeaning of empowerment, in South Africa and elsewhere, is thus both fluid and \ncontested. Feminists have argued that to be empowered \u201cis to be invested with power\u201d \n(Peake 1999, p. 70). Power can be defined as \u2018power over\u2019 where marginalised groups \ngain power at the expense of the already-empowered, facilitating their participation in \neconomic and political structures of society and occupation of positions of power in \nterms of decision-making (Sharp et al. 2003). This notion of power is clearly evident in \nboth BEE legislation and, as discussed subsequently, in strategies to implement this in the \nwine industry. Although a reformist approach, this accepts current social structures, the \nways in which decisions are made and the processes through which resources are \nallocated rather than seeking radical transformation. However, it considers that \npreviously marginalised people should be given positions in hierarchies of power to \nensure equality (ibid.).  \nAlso apparent in South African debates and policies is empowerment defined as \n\u2018power to\u2019, or the ability to act in a particular way, which sees increasing advantages of \n 12\nthe marginalised as not to the increased disadvantage of the already-empowered but as \nbeneficial to communities as a whole (Allen 2003, pp. 5-6). Capacity-building and self-\norganisation by individuals and communities are seen as central to improving access to, \ncontrol over and distribution of resources through the realisation of rights. Currently \npopular with development agencies and at the heart of BEE policies, this notion of \nempowerment is premised on an increase in influence and control through knowledge and \nskills acquisition, where control may be exercised in a number of spheres (individuals, \nhouseholds, communities) and by a range of social groupings (Somerville 1998; World \nBank 1999). Economic and social constraints are seen as acting as prime barriers to the \nrealisation of rights. Empowerment is thus a \u201cconsequence of participating in collective \naction and gaining greater control over the means to one\u2019s livelihood\u201d (Friedmann 1996, \np. 164), requiring both human capacity (for example, the ability to read and write) and \nsocial capital (the ability of people to work together for a common purpose in groups and \norganizations) (Bebbington et al. 2004).  \nOne problem with these understandings of empowerment is that they detract \nattention away from inequalities of power (Fine et al. 2001). What is required, therefore, \nto bring about more radical empowerment is a deeper understanding of power and how it \noperates. For black South Africans, disempowered for generations by a racist regime, \n\u201cpower from within\u201d (Rowlands 1997, p. 111) is particularly significant. Power works \nthrough discourses that construct notions of self-hood such that some people do not have \nthe ability to even think about how the world might be different and even collude with the \nstructures that oppress them (Foucault 1980). Empowerment, therefore, must begin with \n\u2018power from within\u2019, enabling people to contemplate alternative ways of existing and \n 13\ngenerating a belief in their own abilities to have some role in enacting change. As Sharp \net al. (2003, p. 283; see also Townsend et al. 1999) argue:  \nEmpowerment becomes the generation of a sense of effective agency\u2026 From this \nunderstanding of power\u2026the process of gaining empowerment, of considering \noneself a capable agent, is as much an aim of the process and the material end \nresult\u2026of any particular project. \nThe debates about BEE and the nature of empowerment in South Africa are set to \nrumble on; however, in endeavouring to tackle the critical questions of what \nempowerment means and how to empower an impoverished and previously oppressed \nmajority, these debates are both informative and have broader conceptual relevance. An \nimportant question is whether equating empowerment to BEE, as appears to have \nhappened in South African policy arenas, actually depoliticises it, fails to deliver the \nstructural and ideological changes required for radical transformation, and fails to \nfacilitate the attainment of \u2018power from within\u2019 for the previously oppressed majority. \nIn what follows, we explore these questions through a case study of the wine \nindustry where the crucial role played by racist ideologies and discourses means that the \nre-figuration and re-conceptualisation of the racial self is crucial to the project of \nempowerment. This takes place in the very specific and complex local context of the \nWestern Cape, where there are very specific historical and political meanings attached to \nwhat it means to be \u2018black\u2019, \u2018white\u2019 and \u2018coloured\u2019 on and off a wine farm (see Erasmus \n2000). This has become a critical issue because the dominant discourse around black \nempowerment outlined above works in ways that depoliticize race, and where, as we \nhave seen, the meaning of \u2018blackness\u2019 (especially in BEE policies) is often understood in \n 14\nessentialist and afro-centric ways that may marginalize \u2018coloured\u2019 workers.6 It is \nimportant then to understand how racial and class identities work in discourses of power \nin the Western Cape and analyses of the South African wine industry, traditionally reliant \non predominantly \u2018coloured\u2019 labour, need to be grounded in the very specific and local \nconditions that characterize the Western Cape. \n \n\u2018Empowerment\u2019 and the South African wine industry \nThe South African wine industry is confined to the Western Cape and Lower Orange \nRiver, where agriculture is currently performing well in terms of its contributions to GDP \nand export revenue. In 2003, the wine industry alone contributed R16.3 billion or 1.5% of \ntotal GDP (this excludes wine tourism that contributed a further R4.2 billion) (WOSA \n2005).7 The vast majority (R11.4 billion) remained in Cape Town and the Western Cape. \nWhile wine farmers are under considerable competitive pressures in international \nmarkets, the industry is enjoying a renewed prosperity. It is perhaps for this reason that \nthe empowerment debate has been focussed more on this industry than in any other area \nof agriculture. Under apartheid the wine industry was exclusively white-owned and \ninfamous for the appalling treatment endured by its black workforce, described as the \n\u201cworst working conditions experienced in South Africa\u201d (Brown, et al. 2003, p. 23). \nPaternalism defined the relationship between farmer and workers, with the latter \nreceiving \u2018social dividends\u2019 (housing, electricity, water) in addition to wages. However, \nwage levels were extremely low and housing was only usually available to permanent \nemployees (du Toit 1993). Workers were barred from collective organisation and \npunished for efforts to unionise or engage in collective bargaining. The most infamous \n 15\naspect of on-farm labour relations was the \u2018dop\u2019 system, whereby workers were paid a \ncomponent of their wages in the form of low-grade wine (Brown, et al. 2003), resulting \nin serious social problems in worker communities, including alcoholism, domestic \nviolence and foetal alcohol syndrome.  \n While some efforts were made in the 1980s to improve social conditions on farms \n(Ewert and Hamman 1999; Groenewald 1993), the legacy of apartheid-era working \nconditions still affects labour within the wine industry. Pay rates remain extremely low \nand working hours frequently exceed those laid down as acceptable by legislation \n(Brown, et al. 2003; Ewert and du Toit 2004; Women on Farms Project 2003). Physical \nabuse of workers and child labour is still evident on some farms, especially during \nseasonal peaks of labour demand. Health and safety is often poor, particularly in relation \nto exposure to agrochemicals, and the dop system is still practiced on some estates \n(Brown, et al. 2003). In order to reduce labour costs, many employers are now seeking an \nincreased proportion of contracted off-farm labour, much of which is migrant and female \nlabour (Barrientos and Kritzinger 2004; Kritzinger et al. 2004). These non-permanent \nworkers are excluded from many basic entitlements and report much higher levels of \nexploitation and abuse. Moreover, many farmers are abandoning many of the \u2018social \ndividends\u2019 of the paternalist system; a third of farmers, for example, no longer consider \nthe provision of housing to be part of their contract with employees (Ewert and du Toit \n2004; see also Orton et al. 2001).  \nThe President of the Black Association of the Wine and Spirits Industry (BAWSI) \nidentifies the key issues relating to empowerment as \u201ctransformation of ownership..., \ncontrol of the industry [and]\u2026 transforming our skills base\u201d (Pieterse, in National \n 16\nLibrary of South Africa 2004). As discussed, the government has sought to redress the \nbalance between employers and employees through employment acts that, in theory at \nleast, provide workers with high levels of protection (Ethical Trading Initiative 2004; \nKruger and Hamman 2004). Whilst employment legislation seeks to address class-based \nimbalances, BEE legislation has sought to tackle the racially delineated inequalities \ninherited from the previous regime. However, enormous obstacles to transformation \npersist. To a large extent, a white elite continues to run the industry\u2019s major businesses \nand institutions (Ewert and du Toit 2004) and BEE and other empowerment processes are \noften interpreted rather conservatively. Land ownership continues to remain almost \nexclusively in the hands of the minority white population (Kruger 2004; Kruger and \nHamman 2004; Vink 2004). Land reform is difficult to implement in the wine industry \nbecause it is highly capitalised (Williams 2005, p. 479).8 As a result of a different history \nof dispossession to other areas of agriculture, the emphasis in the wine industry is less on \nland transfer than on ownership and managerial control (though land reform is still the \nkey policy against which empowerment is measured (Tregurtha 2004, p. 11), and recent \ngovernment policy has shifted from a pure market driven policy to a much more \ninterventionist stance, which puts the government in a position to confiscate land). \nConsequently the policy focus of transformation has been oriented towards BEE, yet less \nthan 1% of the wine industry is under black ownership (Nxumalo 2003). Employment \npatterns remain highly racialised with few opportunities for black people within the more \nhighly remunerated positions. At the time of writing, more than a decade after the first \ndemocratic election, only one black person has reached the level of chief executive within \nany wine-producing organisation.  \n 17\nThere are clearly limitations in terms of what legislation pertaining to \nempowerment can deliver. Evidence suggests, for example, that many wine industry \nexecutives approach empowerment and associated legislation and initiatives as a set of \nchallenges to be cynically manipulated. As one Department of Labour official observed, \n\u201cThe lawyers are usually at work identifying loopholes before the ink is dry on new \nlegislation\u201d (Anon. 01\/04\/04). Enforcement is difficult because the Department of Labour \nis desperately under-resourced and inspectors meet resistance when organising farm \nvisits. Thus, the pace of socio-economic change within the industry has been rather slow. \nWhile the industry has been highly effective in talking the language of transformation \nand in setting up high profile empowerment initiatives progressive outcomes remain \nlimited. Despite this largely negative picture there is some evidence in both industry-wide \nand grassroots initiatives that some progressive change is taking place. In what follows, \nwe outline examples of these initiatives and assess their role and effectiveness as \n\u2018empowerment\u2019 projects.  \n \nIndustry-wide initiatives: \u2018empowerment\u2019 as ethical labour practices \nAccording to one wine company executive there are around 60 empowerment projects in \nthe South African wine industry at present;9 many people in the industry have accepted \nthe necessity of \u201cdoing something\u201d in order to garner government support (export \npromotions executive, 09\/03\/04). One example is the agreement by KWV in July 2004 to \nsell 25.1% of shares to a BEE consortium.10 However, it appears that where \nempowerment policies have been adopted they have usually been interpreted within the \nnarrow confines of ethical labour practices. While most of the structures of the industry \n 18\nremain unchanged, basic conditions of labour have been improved on some farms by the \nWine Industry Ethical Trade Association (WIETA), a not-for-profit, voluntary \norganisation established in 2002 to promote the ideals of ethical trade in the industry \n(Bek et al. 2006).  \n WIETA has been described as \u201c[setting the] parameters for implementing and \nauditing ethical labour practices and working conditions in the Winelands\u201d (Distell \n2002). It is managed through an executive committee comprising individuals representing \ndifferent interest groups within the industry, including the export promotions agency \nWines of South Africa (WOSA), organised labour, NGOs and the Department of Labour. \nAs of April 2004, approximately 50 producers, suppliers, individual farms and estates \nand other interested parties had become members. WIETA has established a code of good \npractice based on international ethical trade base codes and South African legislation \n(WIETA 2003) and is ensuring that labour legislation is upheld and implemented on \nfarms. Although guaranteeing rights to a safe working environment, freedom of \nassociation, reasonable working hours, the right to a living wage, prohibition of unfair \ndiscrimination and workers\u2019 rights to housing and tenure security is imperative, it does \nnot necessarily equate with worker empowerment. The WIETA code is considered \nmerely a starting point for further empowerment strategies, where empowerment is \nunderstood as improvement in social conditions on farms and ensuring that historically \ndisadvantaged groups are \u201csocially and organisationally capacitated and integrated to \nmake a constructive contribution to the wine industry\u201d (SAWB 2003, p. 22).  \nOther wine industry bodies are more explicitly \u2018empowerment-focused\u2019. For \nexample, SAWB - a not-for-profit entity created by representatives of the wine producers, \n 19\ncellars, labour and wholesale merchants (SAWB 2004) -  is facilitating transformation \nthrough implementing a scorecard system that rates individual companies according to \ntheir achievements in the realms of empowerment, defined as encompassing: \nAccess to land and other economic assets; management control; socio-political \nparticipation and a command over relevant information, i.e. sufficient knowledge \nto be able to exploit opportunities in the industry (SAWB 2003, p. 19).  \nSimilarly, BAWSI has been vocal in campaigning for black people to be given \nopportunities to attain business and technical skills required to participate more widely \nwithin the industry. Its membership is drawn from trade unions, civil society and black-\nowned small businesses. Together, SAWB and BAWSI have taken responsibility for \nensuring that there is clarity about meanings of empowerment and facilitating target-\nsetting. These targets refer to asset ownership, the numbers of managers from previously \ndisadvantaged groups, the distribution of skills in the industry, indirect empowerment \nthrough procurement and outsourcing and the effective participation in industry and \nbusiness enterprise decision-making (SAWB 2003). In addition, the South African Wine \nIndustry Trust (SAWIT) manages two companies: BUSCO (oriented towards the \nprovision of business support) and DEVCO (providing education and training to new \nentrants to the industry and existing workers and their communities).  \nThese industry-wide initiatives are clearly oriented towards BEE strategies and \nempowerment is thus currently defined in quite narrow terms as economic participation. \nModels of empowerment focusing upon black business ownership are beginning to \nemerge. For example, the Lindiwe wine cellar is owned by Reinvest Ltd, which pays a \nproportion of profit dividends to BAWSI (Lindiwe Wines 2004) and successful black \n 20\nbusinessmen, such as leading ANC figure Tokyo Sexwale, are purchasing wine farms in \ntheir own right (du Bois 2004; Fisher 2003). Sexwale, who made his fortune in banking \nand diamonds, is a controversial figure for critics of BEE and epitomises some of the \nproblems inherent in this as an empowerment strategy. Along with Patrice Motsepe (a \ngold tycoon), Saki Macozoma and Cyril Ramaphosa he is at the head of the black \nbusiness elite. Macozoma and Ramaphosa were recently chosen by Standard Bank as \npartners in a deal supposed to boost BEE that netted each around 200m rand (\u00a320m) (The \nEconomist, 14\/10\/04). They represent big ticks in the BEE box but, as one respondent \ncomments, \u201cthey may just be replacing one set of dominating rulers with another\u201d (Anon. \ncommunity projects consultant, 25\/03\/04). \nThese criticisms apart, it is perhaps too early to assess the fullness of the impacts \nof other industry-wide initiatives. At the time of writing, WIETA has completed a year of \nsocial auditing and forty-two members have passed through an initial inspection process. \nThe results show both success stories where producers are complying, particularly in \nproviding a living wage and avoiding child labour, but also areas where labour standards \nare consistently low (http:\/\/www.wieta.org.za\/news.html, accessed 01\/06\/05). However, \nits supporters are optimistic about its potential to make a significant contribution to \nimproved on-farm labour standards and to play a role in facilitating empowerment within \nthe industry. There is no pretence that this is a straightforward process. Discussions \naround the multiple meanings and interpretations of empowerment feature heavily in \ndebates.  \nThe fact that such debates are occurring and feeding into WIETA policy is a \nsymbol of its initial success. They are in part fed by the various experiences of grassroots \n 21\ninitiatives (discussed subsequently), which provide evidence of the challenges in \nfacilitating empowerment and the structural factors impinging upon change in South \nAfrica\u2019s land-based industries (Knight et al 2003). At present WIETA\u2019s ambitions are \nlimited to ensuring full compliance with national laws, which are seen by supporters of \nlabour as highly progressive and advanced in international terms. If WIETA is able to \nachieve full legal compliance it is likely that South African farm workers will benefit \nfrom better working conditions than the majority of their counterparts in other wine \ngrowing regions. However, it is our contention, reflecting the concerns of some of our \nrespondents, that whilst these schemes do bring benefits to those involved they often have \nlimited socio-economic ambitions; the sum of these benefits does not equate to a truly \nemancipatory form of empowerment since they cannot effectively facilitate the \u2018power \nfrom within\u2019 required to empower large numbers of impoverished individuals. In \nparticular, it is unclear how these will be able to deliver the broad-based empowerment \nreferred to in government rhetoric or whether they will perpetuate the enrichment of a \nsmall group of already-powerful black businessmen.  \n \nGrassroots initiatives: \u2018empowerment\u2019 as worker equity  \nThe majority of South Africa\u2019s land-based industries are struggling to adhere to \nlegislative and moral imperatives of progressive change while adapting to a rapidly \nglobalising economy and radical shifts in the structure of the division of labour, which \nhave often resulted in the driving down of wages and worsening labour conditions. \nHowever, a small number of wine estates have become associated with projects that seek \nexplicitly to empower workers (WOSA 2004a). These projects have emerged through the \n 22\ninitiative of individual estate owners and worker\/community organisations (Wesgro \n2003). Although business models tend to vary from case-to-case, many projects have \nbeen categorised as \u2018worker equity schemes\u2019 (Karaan 2004) through which workers have \ngained legal rights to the means of production, often by redirecting their housing grant \nentitlement towards the purchase of land (National Library of South Africa 2004). \nTypically the workers\u2019 group engages in the production of wines under its own label. \nExamples include the Fair Valley Workers\u2019 Association (established to reinvest money \ninto improving education and housing), \u2018Winds of Change\u2019, \u2018Freedom Road\u2019 and \n\u2018Thandi\u2019 (the first wine in the world to receive Fairtrade accreditation) (Thandi.com \n2004b; WOSA 2004b). These initiatives have attracted considerable attention both from \nwithin the industry and from wider media and several have achieved notable export \nsuccess.  \n Amongst the most well-known of the \u2018empowerment wines\u2019 is \u2018New Beginnings\u2019, \nthe first wine made by people of colour from grapes grown on their own land (Mohale \n2003). The initiator was Alan Nelson, a Cape Town legal advocate who bought the \nNelson\u2019s Creek estate (bankrupt under its two previous owners) in the early 1990s (Hiney \n2002). As a reward for helping to produce an award-winning wine in 1997 (Anon 2001; \nNelson's Creek Wine Estate 2000), Nelson donated 9.5ha of the estate to a workers\u2019 \ncooperative on condition that it was used for agriculture (Mohale 2003). Furthermore, by \nchoosing wine production the co-operative could either have access to Nelson\u2019s \nequipment and hi-tech cellar or he would purchase their grapes. It was also agreed that \nthe workers would cultivate their land in their spare time, as they remained employees of \nNelson\u2019s Creek (Anon 2001). The National Department of Land Affairs recognised the \n 23\ninitiative as a land reform project and also provided the co-operative assistance which, \nusing income from their initial sales, bought a further 9ha of land. Profits are used to \nenable all local children to attend school, paying fees, transport and uniform costs (Botha \n2002). Each co-operative member now has a life insurance policy and retirement fund \nand each family has received a cash dividend of R6500 (currently around \u00a3590\/$1036).11 \nIn the longer term, the co-operative is aiming to expand production, create a cellar, \nconstruct housing and enhance local education facilities.  \nSimilarly, the Thandi project in Lebanon, 75kms east of Cape Town, aims to \nempower previously disadvantaged farming communities (Thandi.com 2004a). Lebanon \nwas founded during the 1960s by the Forestry Commission (SAFCOL) to house its \nworkforce (Dring 2001). In 1991, SAFCOL restructured its operations and Lebanon\u2019s \ninhabitants were made redundant. In response, the owner of a neighbouring wine estate, \nPaul Cluver, donated 100ha of land to the community for the purposes of farming; \nSAFCOL offered a further 100ha for rent at a nominal rate. A Farming Trust, a Worker\u2019s \nTrust and a Community Trust were initiated to manage the project (Kruger and Hamman \n2004). Profits generated from the farm have been re-invested for educational and other \ncommunity-related purposes. Members of the Cluver family have acted as mentors to the \ncommunity since the inception of the project and the Cluver estate makes its cellar \nfacilities available to Thandi\u2019s winemaking staff (Thandi.com 2004b). The Capespan \nFoundation has developed the project through a business plan to provide enhanced \ntraining and skill development opportunities to the community; it aims to limit its \ninvolvement and work towards an exit-strategy whereby community members become \nsufficiently capacitated to take on management responsibilities. The Foundation also \n 24\nensures that the Fairtrade premium is reinvested in projects of benefit to the local \ncommunity.  \nThe Thandi land reform model has attracted interest from Russian and US policy \nmakers and consultants (Morris 2004). A co-operative approach using an equity share \nsystem is perceived by some land reform experts as a logical and progressive approach in \ncountries like South Africa, where previously disadvantaged people lack skills and access \nto capital. Thus, redistribution of land alone is unlikely to provide an economically sound \napproach for effecting meaningful transformation. The contribution of established \nfarmers is particularly important as they can offer management and technical expertise as \nwell as access to equipment and other expensive resources during the period of transition. \nOtherwise the market price of land, high start up costs associated with land-based \nindustries and a lack of technical experience on the part of new entrants militates against \nsuccess. However, worker equity land transfers represent just one form of transformation \nscheme in the Western Cape wine industry (Karaan 2004). Winds of Change wines, made \nin association with the Sonop estate, donates approximately \u00a31 for each bottle sold to be \nre-invested in community projects such as housing and education (Low 2001). The \nFreedom Road project on the Backsberg Estate uses profits from the sale of wines for \nupgrading the standard of worker housing (WOSA 2004b). A workers\u2019 vintage port is \nproduced on the Helderkruin estate to fund \u2018social upliftment\u2019 projects (ibid.). Such \nschemes are related more to improving living conditions relating to health and \ncommunity development (and thus to apartheid-era \u2018social upliftment\u2019 reforms within the \nindustry) than to empowerment per se but, as Su Birch (CEO of WOSA) observes, \u201cgiven \nour history, it [transformation] is simply a thing we have to do\u201d (in Distell 2002). \n 25\nDespite the apparent market success of \u2018empowerment wines\u2019 (see Bek et al. \n2006), critics are numerous and often scathing in their assessment of what precisely these \nhave delivered. Radical voices within the industry believe that the empowerment \ncredentials of many of the grassroots equity share schemes are greatly overstated. Indeed, \none CEO of a winery told us: \u201cDon\u2019t bother with empowerment wines, they are a farce\u2026 \nTo build hopes around projects like those is absurd\u201d (Anon 11\/03\/04). For some \nobservers the projects represent nothing more than a subtle readjustment of the neo-\npaternalist order, as the co-operatives remain dependent on the farmer in a number of \ncrucial ways, including access to equipment, cellaring facilities, marketing support and \naccess to sales networks; empowerment is thus impossible because of the embeddedness \nof these forms of dependency. One industry figure refers to a \u201csoup kitchen mentality\u201d \namongst farmers, suggesting that they are more interested in \u201cself-serving charitable \nprojects\u201d than initiatives that could challenge the structural inequalities of the industry \n(BAWSI representative 23\/03\/04; see also Wardman 2004). An absence of meaningful \ntraining and genuine mentoring precludes any significant advancement by new \nshareholders. A pernicious form of \u201cpseudo-empowerment\u201d (ibid) occurs whereby \nindividuals are under the illusion that as owners of the means of production they have \nsome form of power and control, whilst in reality they remain dependent upon the white \nfarmer due to an absence of technical and business knowledge transfer: \u201ccut the umbilical \ncord provided by the white owner and his staff and the project will wither away\u201d (ibid.). \nCritics, especially industry insiders from historically disadvantaged backgrounds, argue \nthat despite much talk about mentoring and training opportunities relatively little of this \nactually occurs. The occasional individual may experience upward social mobility and \n 26\nmay even become a symbol of the success of a project but this is atypical of the \nexperience of the majority.   \n Several respondents allege that white farmers initiate empowerment projects for \nbusiness rather than altruistic reasons, particularly the considerable favourable publicity \nthey attract for farmers, their estates and their products (WIETA representative 25\/03\/04; \nrepresentative of African Farmer\u2019s Union 15\/03\/04); the \u2018halo effect\u2019 has been a way for \nthese estates to differentiate themselves within a crowded market. Some argue, for \nexample, that Cluver and Capespan have benefited most from the positive publicity \nsurrounding Thandi (the brand name has been used for a range of produce unrelated to \nthe project). One respondent claimed that a farmer increased sales from his estate by \n100% following the inception of a well-publicised worker empowerment project \n(industry analyst 12\/03\/04). Farmers also benefit from an increase in worker motivation \nand skill levels. In the majority of cases the members of the cooperative continue to work \non the farmer\u2019s estate as well as their own vineyard. Increased productivity may result \nfrom an increased sense of self worth and gratitude to employers. In addition, accusations \nhave been made that worker equity schemes are initiated to provide cash injections, via \ngovernment housing and land reform grants, for farmers who might otherwise have faced \nbankruptcy.   \nOthers in the industry adopt a more nuanced stance. They accept that some \nfarmers become involved for self-serving reasons, and in such cases beneficial outcomes \nare restricted, but they consider that projects should be evaluated according to whether \nthe workers have gained \u201cindependence and self esteem\u201d and represent \u201ca reduced burden \non the state\u201d (NGO trainer 31\/03\/04). Key indicators of social progress include raising \n 27\nincomes, the ability to save for a pension and gaining a permanent home. Such outcomes \nmay not match the empowerment ideals held by more radical observers but in the context \nof overcoming the legacies of apartheid can be seen as pragmatic and progressive. Some \nrespondents do not see material ownership of businesses or land as a central component \nof the process: \u201cnot everyone can be an entrepreneur\u201d (ibid.). Instead the focus should be \nupon developing a sense of ownership over the business process. Some of the more \nsuccessful initiatives do involve highly structured training programmes, which ensure \nthat workers gain competence in business and technical skills, are tailored according to \nlocal needs and designed such that workers can gradually take increasing levels of \nresponsibility and control. Whilst there is a measure of pragmatism among these more \nmoderate voices within the wine industry, there is a general consensus that the next step \nmust be for producers to go further than WIETA codes of practice to effect meaningful \nempowerment. \n Our research suggests that at the local level the various worker equity schemes \nhave produced mixed results and some have undoubtedly been prone to forms of elite \ncapture. Yet, a number of communities have been afforded opportunities that would not \notherwise have been available to them and have gained notable social dividends; some \nindividuals have been enabled to advance their careers in ways that would not otherwise \nhave been possible. However, the gains across the industry have been very small. Projects \nsuch as Thandi and New Beginnings still operate very much at the margins of the \nindustry as a whole,12 most of which remains unreformed; some critics fear that the \nnovelty of \u2018empowerment wines\u2019 will diminish and more sustainable approaches to \nempowerment and transformation need to be identified and implemented. In addition, the \n 28\nextent of local contestations over the value of worker equity projects should not be \nunderestimated. One bone of contention is the necessity for projects and products to be \nbranded \u2018empowerment\u2019 or \u2018transformation\u2019 in order to attract government monies and \nthe eyes of retailers and consumers; the seemingly casual utilisation of the very language \nthat represents ongoing internal struggles in South Africa is problematic to many of our \nrespondents. \n \nDisempowering neo-liberalism and depoliticising empowerment?  \nThe wine industry demonstrates the difficulty of translating policy and discourses of \nempowerment into meaningful outcomes in South Africa. In particular, it raises two \nimportant questions: first, whether empowerment is possible within a neo-liberal \neconomic context and, second, how empowerment might be depoliticised through \nappropriation in a context of neo-liberal governance. To take the first question, one of the \ndilemmas for both the wine industry and the South African government is that \nempowerment strategies are framed by neo-liberal macro-economic contexts. Trying to \neffect broad-based empowerment within the context of unprotected free market \nglobalisation is difficult (some would say impossible). International market pressures are \nbeing felt by land-based industries producing increasing levels of casualisation at the \nsame time that the government is striving to improve working conditions through labour \nlaws (Barrientos and Kritzinger 20004; du Toit 2004; Ewert and du Toit 2004). One \ncould argue that only initiatives that disrupt market forces by finding niches within \nmarkets, such as fair and ethical trade schemes, are likely to make an impact, albeit at a \nmuch localised scale. The South African wine industry is currently doing well at \n 29\ninternational levels by exploiting these niches, but whether the industry will cope with \nsignificant re-adjustments in terms of the racialised (and increasingly gendered) division \nof labour and other patterns of employment remains to be seen. Empowerment in this \ncontext is unlikely to be successful without significant support in education, training and \nmentoring such that the newly \u2018empowered\u2019 can operate at high levels of efficiency very \nrapidly.  \n The private sector has been very slow to fulfil this role; in addition, the \ngovernment\u2019s adoption of \u2018roll-back neo-liberalism\u2019 (see Peck and Tickell 2002), \narguably conceding too quickly to the \u2018natural\u2019 power of global markets (Hart 2002, p. 7) \nand dismissing the role of the state, creates significant constraints. Such criticism has \nbeen levelled at policies in general and is particularly salient in the case of the wine \nindustry, which receives very little state support to fund education and R&D, in contrast \nto other wine-making regions.13 In addition, the unique political situation in South Africa \nmeans that the ANC is unlikely to want to be seen explicitly to support an industry whose \nleading figures were central to operations under apartheid. There are fundamental \nquestions, therefore, about the institutional infrastructure required to support \nempowerment initiatives and whether the government\u2019s adherence to neo-liberal macro-\neconomics and governance is compatible with the effective construction of that \ninfrastructure.  \nIronically, as we have seen, the state has intervened in drafting labour laws but \nthe government is aiming to relax these to spur faster economic growth and, it purports, \nspeed up redistribution. In his 2005 State of the Nation speech, President Mbeki stated \nthat growth will come from less restrictive labour laws, simpler taxes, less bureaucracy \n 30\nand more competition. Redistribution will rely on industry charters and BEE legislation. \nHowever, these two strategies conflict: the first aims to reduce the cost of doing business, \nthe second risks increasing it again (The Economist 17\/02\/05). Empowerment strategies \nare also bound up with a particular notion of citizenship, itself shaped to some extent by \nneo-liberalism, wherein previously disenfranchised people are \u2018trained\u2019 to see themselves \nas stakeholders with choice and voice in the \u2018free\u2019 markets of their rapidly globalizing \neconomies. However, this training \n\u2026elides the conditions in which many of the \u2018trained\u2019 people\u2026still find \nthemselves: with no change in the capitalist processes and institutions that \nconstrain their experiences, actions, and choices (Ong 1997, p. 158). \nThus, discourses of empowerment reveal the paradoxical ways in which neo-liberal \ngovernance uses the processes of \u201csymbolic inclusion\u201d while relying on processes of \nmaterial exclusion (Miraftab 2004, p. 239). \nThis brings us to the second question concerning how the concept of \nempowerment is being both depoliticised and deployed in profoundly political ways by \nthe South African government. The shift from the original aims of the RDP and the \nadoption of neo-liberal modes of governance by ANC governments has also meant the \ndepoliticization of empowerment, from a radical concept aimed at the transformation not \nonly of individuals but of structures of domination through participatory methodologies \n(Cleaver 2002) to one in which participation and empowerment are divorced from \nstructures of oppression. As evidence from the wine industry demonstrates, \nempowerment is simply a process by which changes in labour organisation and working \nconditions build an individual\u2019s sense of self-worth and esteem. This would appear to be \n 31\nin accordance with debates about \u2018power from within\u2019, but in practice self-worth and \nesteem are reduced to individual economic gain and access to resources that fail to \ntransform the status quo (Miraftab 2004, p. 242). BEE and worker equity schemes \ndiscursively attempt to enable and foster \u2018power from within\u2019 but, as our evidence \nsuggests, they are flawed. Respondents and analysts point to the problematic paternalism \nthat still underpins such initiatives and a fundamental lack of broad-based capacity-\nbuilding. Moreover, their outcomes appear to be relatively insignificant in the face of a \nmacro-economic context that continues to exacerbate inequality and disempower \nworkers. \nA critical understanding of empowerment is vital to transformation in South \nAfrica since this problematises both mechanisms of decision-making and less tangible \nelements of socio-cultural organisation that constrain the lives of marginalised people, \nhindering decision-making and ensuring that they are socialised to accept the status quo \nbecause they cannot even contemplate alternatives. The problem with current policies is \nthat economic reductionism threatens to depoliticise the concept. Empowerment requires \nboth systemic and structural changes but, because it has become a \u201cbig idea\u201d appropriated \nby the government, there is a danger that locally-derived strategies will be crowded out \n(Nagar and Raju 2003, p. 2). The South African government is attempting to change the \nways in which resources are organised in communities, localities and the state but \nhousehold power relations, for example, continue to disempower women and young \npeople. It is here that locally-derived empowerment strategies will be critical in effecting \nchange. However, as Foucault (1980) demonstrates, power must also be conceived of as \nnetworked rather than localised; by focusing only on the individual and the local as sites \n 32\nof empowerment, the significance of other sites of power (the state, global capitalism, \npatriarchy, racism) is minimized (Cooke and Kothari 2002; Miraftab 2004).  \nUntil these more radical understandings of power and empowerment are \nacknowledged and incorporated into government policies the failure to address broader \nissues of social and economic transformation will persist and policies aimed at the \nempowerment of marginalised individuals and communities will continue to have \napparently pre-determined and depoliticized outcomes. In the case of the wine industry, \ndespite several years of \u2018empowerment\u2019 initiatives, change has been minimal and \nstructures that continue to exploit particular groups of impoverished male and female \nlabourers (especially casual and contract workers, who include new in-migrants and \nformer permanent South African workers) are largely still in place across the industry. \nEmpowerment has been reduced to improvements in labour conditions which, although \nprogressive, negate it as an open and productive concept to be utilised as a \u201ctool in the \ndynamics of resistance and social change\u201d (Graham 2004, p. 47). Some critics suggest \nthat more limited notions of empowerment still have potential to open up new spaces for \npolitical action and radical transformation (see, for example, DeFilippis 2004; Schuurman \n2004; Williams 2004). However, given the depoliticised notion of empowerment adopted \nby the ANC government, its faith in the empowering potential of an emergent black \nbourgeoisie to facilitate broad-based empowerment, and its commitment to \ndisempowering neo-liberal macro-economics (Hart 2002), this currently appears unlikely \nin South Africa. \n \nConclusions \n 33\nThe complexities and contestations over meanings and strategies of empowerment are \nclearly of enormous significance in post-apartheid South Africa. This paper has \nhighlighted the political, moral and economic imperatives underpinning drives towards \nempowering a previously oppressed majority. Since 1994, empowerment has been \nperceived as fundamental to nation-building and to socio-economic transformation aimed \nat overcoming racialised poverty and polarisation. The ANC government, however, has \nmore recently utilised a narrower understanding of empowerment in legislation and \npolicy, enacting policies to bring about \u2018power over\u2019 and \u2018power to\u2019 specifically through \nBEE. What appears to be missing, however, are policies and practices that foster \u2018power \nfrom within\u2019 through capacity-building, education and enabling participation within \ncommunities. Debates around BEE are essentially about the nature of power and the \nextent and influence of economic participation. The profound constraints on these \nempowerment strategies reveal much about the contested nature of power relations and \nthe distribution of power in South Africa, which is arguably largely untouched but for the \nemergence of a small, black middle class.  \nThe wine industry exemplifies how corporate South Africa has responded with a \nselective interpretation of social and economic transformation, as demanded by BEE \nprior to 2004, and consequently there are still high levels of social inequality and a legacy \nof inadequate stakeholder engagement (Heese 2003). It is unclear how radical \nempowerment will be effected following the 2004 Act. Despite fierce criticism, some \nsuggest that it has the potential to foster a less patrimonial, less racially and ethnically \ndivisive BEE strategy and to create a \u2018growth coalition\u2019 capable of sustainable \ndevelopment and empowerment of the black majority (Iheduru 2004). However, it is \n 34\nunclear how the Act will alter cultures of governance that have so far failed to deliver \nsocial and economic justice and empowerment or the required public institutional \ntransformation. It is unclear how it will help tackle civil society disengagement and the \ndisempowerment of women, the poor and rural households that has occurred since 1994 \n(Khosa 2002). It is unclear how it will overcome the less tangible elements of socio-\ncultural organisation that constrain the lives of marginalised people, especially \nimpoverished men, women and young people, denying them a sense of effective agency \nthat is central to empowerment (Sharp et al. 2003). One positive outcome, however, is \nthat the state appears not beholden to any particular interest and has recognised recently \nthat the legitimating role assigned to emergent black middle classes threatened to turn \nBEE strategy into nepotistic accumulation, which also threatened to re-racialise the \ncountry, widening black inequality gaps and precluding broad-based empowerment. As \nIheduru (2004, p. 25) argues, while the state remains \u201cquasi-pluralistic\u201d, where no social \ngroup holds power, the potential exists for other powerful groups (including organised \nlabour and women activists) to push for an enactment of empowerment policies stripped \nof the patrimonial and paternalistic accumulation strategies that have thus far \ncharacterised them.  \nThe depth and urgency of debates about black empowerment in South Africa is \narguably unique and positive achievements should not be forgotten amidst considerable \ncriticism. Its legislative framework is seen by supporters of labour as highly progressive \nand advanced in international terms. However, transformation is slow and empowerment \nis clearly constrained by neo-liberal macro-economics, interpreted in different ways by \ndifferent stakeholders and often cynically manipulated by those already invested with \n 35\npower. Empowerment initiatives may not be delivering radical outcomes as yet, but they \nare part of a process of setting a tone throughout South African society and perhaps \nbeyond, reinforcing the imperative of transformation and identifying some of the \nchallenges that are situated within local, national and global power structures. It is \nimperative, however, that policies are adopted to bring about meaningful empowerment, \nwhere empowerment means giving greater political and economic autonomy to black \npeople, reducing inequality and challenging their subordinate position in many spheres of \nlife (Kritzinger and Vorster 1998). It is also imperative that power is identified less in \nterms of domination over others and more in terms of the capacity of previously \noppressed peoples to increase their own self-reliance, the right to determine choices in \nlife and to gain control over crucial resources.  \n \nAcknowledgments \nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of the Nuffield Foundation who funded this \nproject (award number: SGS\/00909\/G).

Many of the Afrikaner-owned \u201ccorporate \nbehemoths\u201d that still exist in South Africa emerged out of this particular empowerment \nstrategy (Iheduru 2004, p. 4). \n3  We use the term black as inclusive of all people of colour whilst being mindful of the \nsensitivities associated with such terminology. The complexities and politics of re-\nfiguring the racial self in the project of empowerment, particularly within the Western \nCape with its majority Afrikaans-speaking \u2018coloured\u2019 population, are dealt with \nsubsequently. \n4 A total of 25 formal interviews and 6 informal interviews were conducted. A system of \nreferral was used following initial contact in the field with WIETA board members. As \nWIETA operates as an alliance between private sector, NGOs and labour unions a \nreasonably representative perspective could be gained cutting across the industry's key \norganisations. Due to the politically and commercially sensitive nature of much of the \ninformation contained in this paper the identity of all sources is protected. \n 48\n                                                                                                                                                                             \n5 \u2018Black\u2019 refers to all people of colour but ANC statements indicate a clear preference for \nblack African peoples; BEE seeks to empower all people of colour in general and \n\u201cAfrican people in particular\u201d (ANC 2002). Given its demographics, this has implications \nfor racial politics in the Western Cape. \n6  Given that Broad-Based BEE legislation was introduced only in 2004, it is too early to \ntell whether this is the case in reality but we have not found evidence of this within the \nwine industry. There is a perception amongst a majority of Coloureds and Indians in the \nWestern Cape that BEE has a negative influence on race relations and poverty alleviation \n(Kornegay 2005). However, government ministers are keen to stress that \u2018Black\u2019 in BEE \nis an inclusive term. According to Mxolisi Buthelesi, Director of Trade and Industry and \nresponsible for BEE, \u201cthe beneficiaries of BEE interventions should\u2026 be [all] South \nAfrican citizens who are: Blacks (African, Coloured and Indians)\u2026\u201d It would be \nunlawful under the Equality clause to discriminate against Coloured people in any BEE \ninitiative and counterproductive given that Coloureds and Indians compose 55% of the \nWestern Cape population. \n7 R16.3 equated in 2003 to an estimated US$3.172bn. South Africa is the 10th biggest \nexporter of wines in the world, with export sales growth increasing by 24.4% per annum \nbetween 1992 and 2003 and rising to 30% in 2004 (Tregurtha 2004). \n8 Land makes up less than 10% of the assets of the industry and the production of grapes \nproduces less value added than virtually every other part of the supply chain (Tregurtha \n2004). \n 49\n                                                                                                                                                                             \n9 BEE is defined in a variety of ways, but ownership and decision-making power are \ncrucial; \u2018black-owned\u2019 businesses are those with a minimum of 50% of shares owned by \nblacks, \u2018empowerment-related\u2019 are projects with 25% black ownership. \n10 KWV (Ko\u00f6peratiewe Wynbouersvereniging van Suid Africa Beperk\/Co-operative \nWine Growers Association of South Africa Ltd.) has been at the centre of the wine \nindustry since 1918 and this deal with Phetego is seen as a milestone and precedent in \nBEE within agriculture (see Williams 2005 for a detailed examination of the KWV deal). \n11 This was at a time when median monthly wage rates amongst working class black \nhouseholds employed in agriculture were as follows:  \nFormal Unionised Formal Non-unionised Informal \nMale Female Male Female Male Female\nR900\n(\u00a382)\n($143)\nR652\n(\u00a360)\n($104)\nR500\n(\u00a345)\n($80)\nR448\n(\u00a341)\n($71)\nR375\n(\u00a334)\n($60)\nR326\n(\u00a330)\n($52)\n \nSource: Global Policy Network (2004). \n12 Although there is no published data that we are aware of estimating what percentage of \nwine production is constituted by \u2018empowerment wines\u2019, an educated guess would put \nthis is in single figures. By 2003 within primary production only 425 people had \nbenefited from the land reform process and 511ha of wine grapes had come under the \ncontrol of previously disadvantaged South Africans. More have undoubtedly benefited \nfrom other empowerment projects, but evidence suggests the overall rate of \ntransformation remains low (Tregurtha 2004). \n13 The French wine industry, for example, enjoys significant state support and the \nphenomenal ascent of Australian wines within the global market during the 1990s was \nfuelled by heavy state investment. \n 50\n"}
