Berry\u20201\nThe bacterial flagellar switch that controls the direction of flagellar rotation during chemotaxis has\na highly cooperative response. This has previously been understood in terms of the classic\ntwo-state, concerted model of allosteric regulation. Here, we used high-resolution optical\nmicroscopy to observe switching of single motors and uncover the stochastic multistate nature of\nthe switch. Our observations are in detailed quantitative agreement with a recent general model\nof allosteric cooperativity that exhibits conformational spread\u2014the stochastic growth and\nshrinkage of domains of adjacent subunits sharing a particular conformational state. We expect\nthat conformational spread will be important in explaining cooperativity in other large signaling\ncomplexes.\nThe elements of protein signaling networksare often complexes that change theiractivity in response to binding specific\nligands. Multisubunit protein complexes often\nshow cooperativity, with either binding or activity\nshowing a switchlike sigmoidal dependence upon\nligand concentration. Cooperativity has classically\nbeen understood in terms of the concerted (1) or\nsequential (2) models of allosteric regulation,\nwhich describe coupling between ligand binding\nand subunit conformation, and coupling of\nconformations between different subunits. Both\nmodels have deterministic elements. In the\nconcerted model, coupling between subunits is\nabsolute: All subunits switch conformation simul-\ntaneously. In the sequential model, coupling\nbetween ligand binding and conformation is\nabsolute: When a ligand binds a subunit, that\nsubunit switches. More recently, a mathematical\nmodel of the general allosteric scheme proposed\nby Eigen (3) was constructed in which both types\nof coupling are probabilistic (4, 5). This model\nencompasses the classical mechanisms at its limits\nand introduces the mechanism of conformational\nspread, with domains of a particular conforma-\ntional state growing or shrinking faster than ligand\nbinding. Although the classical models have been\nuseful in explaining the regulation of numerous\noligomeric proteins (6, 7), conformational spread\nis a natural extension that will be necessary for\nunderstanding cooperativity in large multimeric\nprotein complexes (4, 8).\nThe bacterial switch complex in Escherichia\ncoli is a large protein ring that controls the\ndirection of rotation of the bacterial flagellar motor\n(9) (Fig. 1A). The switch response shows a steep\nsigmoidal relationship between the concentration\nof the response regulator CheY-P and motor\nrotational bias (the fraction of time spent rotating\nin a given direction), contributing to the remark-\nable gain of the bacterial chemotactic network\n(10, 11). Binding of CheY-P to FliM protein\nsubunits of the complex is much less cooperative\n[Hill coefficient <2 (12, 13)] than the switch\nresponse [Hill coefficient 10.1 (10)]. In terms of\nclassical allosteric regulation theory, this precludes\nthe sequential model and favors the concerted\nmodel, where the binding cooperativity can be less\nthan the response cooperativity (14). Further\nevidence against the sequential model is that\nflagellar motors can switch at low temperatures\nin the absence of CheY (15).\nConsistent with the concerted model, the\nflagellar switch has traditionally been understood\nin binary terms, with instantaneous switching\nbetween stable counterclockwise (CCW) and\nclockwise (CW) rotation (16\u201320). However, it is\ndifficult to imagine amechanism for instantaneous\nconcerted transitions of such a large complex\nwithout invoking action at a distance. A confor-\nmational spread model of the flagellar switch has\nbeen constructed (4) that, in contrast to the two-\nstate concerted model, allows for a multistate\nswitch (Fig. 1, B to D). The directly observable\nconsequence of conformational spread in this\nsystem is that switch events should be non-\ninstantaneous with broadly distributed durations\ndue to the biased random walk of conformational\nspread. Additionally, incomplete switches due to\nrapid incomplete growth and shrinkage of\nnucleated domains should be observable as\ntransient speed fluctuations in otherwise stable\nrotation.\n1Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of\nOxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PU, UK. 2Nanobiology\nLaboratories, Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka\nUniversity, 1-3 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871 Japan.\n3Centre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Institute,\nUniversity ofOxford, St. Giles,OxfordOX13LB, UK. 4Department\nof Integrative Biology, Valley Life Sciences Building, University of\nCalifornia\u2013Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94708, USA. 5Carl Icahn\nLaboratory, Princeton University, Washington Road, Princeton,\nNJ 08644, USA. 6Oxford Centre for Integrative Systems Biology,\nDepartment of Biochemistry, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1\n3QU, UK.\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\n\u2020To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Angles\nand radii of the bead trajectory were obtained by\nfitting an ellipse to the trajectory, and then con-\nverted to instantaneous motor speed (22).\nMedian filtered motor speed records show\ncomplete switching between CW and CCW\nstates and incomplete switching to speed levels\nin between (Fig. 2A, left panel). The multistate\nnature of the record renders traditional zero-\ncrossing analyses of motor switching (18, 20)\ninadequate. Instead, we defined complete\nswitches by sequential crossing of two thresh-\nolds, set at two-thirds of the mean CWand CCW\nspeeds (Fig. 2A, right panel). A typical switch\nevent is displayed in detail in Fig. 2B. Filtering,\nwhich is required to show the CW and CCW\nspeeds clearly, extends the apparent duration of\na switch (Fig. 2B, left panel), but its finite\nduration is evident in the unfiltered data (Fig.\n2B, center and right panels). Switches were\nobserved with a broad range of durations\nacross the population (Fig. 2, B to D) and\nwithin each cell record (see fig. S2 for an\nexample set). Some switches require more than\none revolution for completion, and not all\nswitches vary in speed monotonically through\nthe event. For example, the switch in Fig. 2D\nFig. 1. Structure and conformational spread model of the\nbacterial flagellar switch. (A) Schematic of the E. coli bacterial\nflagellar motor. Indicated are the likely positions of switch\ncomplex proteins FliG (~26 copies), FliM (~34 copies), and FliN\n(~136 copies) and the torque-generating stator units MotA4MotB2\n(~10 copies, orange) (9). Structural studies indicate that con-\nformational changes in FliM upon binding of the signaling\nmolecule CheY-P are coupled indirectly to conformational\nchanges in the FliG track, which interfaces with the torque-\ngenerating units to determine rotation direction (21, 34\u201336).\nWe consider the switch complex to be a ring of 34 identical\nprotomers, each consisting of ~1 FliG, 1 FliM, and a tetramer of\nFliN subunits. Each protomer possesses a single binding site to\nwhich a CheY-P molecule can be bound (B) or not bound (b) and\nhas two conformations, active (A, corresponding to CW rotation)\nor inactive (a, CCW). (B) A free-energy diagram of the four states\nof a protomer and the transitions between them, for the case of\nCW bias = 0.5. For simplicity, we consider the symmetrical case\nwhere the magnitude of the free-energy difference between\nfavored and unfavored states (EA) is the same with or without\nCheY-P (black circle) bound. (C) Interactions between adjacent protomers\nfavor pairs with the same conformation. We assume that the free energy of\ninteraction is lower by EJ for any like pair compared to any unlike pair,\nindependent of CheY-P binding. These interactions add 0, +2EJ or \u20132EJ to the\nfree energy of a conformational change, depending on the state of adjacent\nprotomers. (D) Above a critical value of EJ the ring spends themajority of time in\na coherent state, occasionally stochastically switching between CCW and CW\nconfigurations. Switches typically occur by a single nucleation of a new domain,\nfollowed by conformational spread of the domain, which follows a biased\nrandom walk until it either encompasses the entire ring or collapses back to the\nprevious coherent state (Movie S1). The model behaves like the classical\nsequential model in the limit of large EA (absolute coupling between binding\nand conformation) and like the classical concerted model in the limit of large EJ\n(absolute coupling between subunit conformations).\nFig. 2.

S3), excluding the possibility\nthat these events were artifacts of the rotation\nassay. A typical incomplete switch in the me-\ndian filtered speed record is shown in detail in\nFig. 2E. Incomplete switches to a variety of speed\nlevels are observed, including levels that result\nin transient reversal of rotation. The histogram\nof speeds (Fig. 2A, right panel) for any given\nrecord does not clearly identify preferred speed\nlevels, such as stops, during incomplete switch\nevents. However, incomplete switchesmay explain\n\u201cpauses\u201d observed previously in measurements\nwith lower angular and time resolution (25).\nIndependent evidence for multistate behavior\nwas obtained using an optical trap (26) to stall\npairs of 0.5-mm beads attached to switching\nmotors. Bead pairs rotated through ~90\u00b0 in a fixed\noptical trap when the direction of motor torque\nreversed. Complete switches of finite duration and\nincomplete switching were observed (fig. S4), as\nwith the rotating beads.\nWe used Monte Carlo simulations (22) of the\nconformational spread model of the bacterial\nflagellar switch for comparison to our experi-\nmental results. The kinetic parameters (Fig. 3,\nlegend) were fixed to the values wb = 10 s\n\u22121 and\nwa = 10\n4 s\u22121, following previous studies (4, 12),\nwhereas the thermodynamic parameters EA and\nEJ (Fig. 1) were chosen to match the mean\nexperimental values at CW bias 0.5 of complete\nswitch durations and of intervals between\ncomplete switches (22). The simulated CheY-P\nconcentration was varied to obtain the desired\nbias in each simulation. To allow direct compar-\nison between the conformational spread model\nand experimental data, we assumed a linear\ndependence of motor speed on the number of\nactive protomers in the ring. This assumption is\nbased on the motor containing a large number of\nindependent units (27), each of which generates\nconstant torque in a direction specified by the\nstate of the nearest rotor protomer (Fig. 1). A\nLangevin simulation modeled the viscous load of\nthe bead connected to the motor by a flexible\ntether, thereby converting simulated activity on\nthe ring (Fig. 3A) into rotation angle of the bead\n(Fig. 3B) (22). Simulated records (Fig. 3) are\nqualitatively indistinguishable from experimental\nrecords (Fig. 2) and were analyzed using\nidentical methods. Figure 3 shows fast (C) and\nslow (D) complete switches and incomplete\nswitches (E) for comparison to Fig. 2, C to E.\nWe made a detailed quantitative comparison\nbetween the experimental data and the predic-\ntions of the conformational spread model. To\nexclude possible artifacts due to the rotation\nassay, we analyzed only cell records, switches,\nand intervals between switches that satisfied strict\nsets of criteria (22). Figure 4A shows switch\nduration distributions for experimental (blue)\nand simulated (red) data. The distributions are\nindistinguishable, each with a peak at ~8 ms\nand a standard deviation of ~15ms, in addition to\nthe fitted mean of ~20 ms. The shortest switches\nlast less than 2 ms, whereas the longest last more\nthan 100 ms. Switch durations are not correlated\nwith position of the event in the orbit (22), and\ndistributions for subsets of the data sorted\naccording to motor bias and switch direction\nshowed no clear dependence on either (Fig. 4A,\ninset). The distribution of durations cannot be\nexplained as an artifact of elasticity in the hook-\nbead system: Using the largest published exper-\nimental estimate of hook compliance (28), the\nsimulated hook-bead response time for a 0.5-mm\ndiameter bead is approximately 0.7 ms (22).\nAdditionally, we performed experiments and\nsimulations using 0.35-mm diameter beads. The\nunderlying switch duration distribution, obtained\nby deconvolution of the experimental distribution\nand the simulated hook-bead response time\ndistribution, was independent of bead size (22).\nWe also compared the distribution of intervals\nbetween complete switches. Complete switches\nwere detected using the dual-threshold scheme of\nFig. 2A (22), allowing intervals to be defined\nwithout sensitivity to incomplete switches that\nmight otherwise skew the distributions toward a\nshorter time scale. Figure 4B (top) shows interval\ndistributions at three different values of bias, to\ncompare switching kinetics at different CheY-P\nconcentrations (20) (see fig. S6 for other biases).\nBoth experimental (blue) and simulated (red) in-\ntervals are exponentially distributed in the mea-\nsured range (up to ~10 s) with bias-dependent\nmean interval lengths (Fig. 4B, bottom). Mean\ninterval lengths are robust to at least T20% var-\niations in threshold and median filter level (fig.\nS7). Analysis of the protomer states underlying\nthe simulation does not change the distribu-\ntions, indicating that missed events are not im-\nportant in our analyses (22) and that incomplete\nswitches are not artifacts of unresolved fast pairs\nof complete switches. Our results are in contrast to\na recent study that measured gamma-distributed\nintervals (20). It is possible that gamma distribu-\ntions were an artifact of attaching beads to long\nfilaments (29). Alternatively, switching kinetics\nmay have been different because of the perma-\nnently active CheY mutant used.\nWe quantified incomplete switching as a\nfurther independent test of agreement between\ndata and the conformational spread model. An\nincomplete switch in a CCW interval was defined\nby a downward crossing of the threshold bCCW =\nFig. 3.

Incomplete switches in CW\nepisodes were defined similarly. The intervals\nbetween incomplete switches were exponentially\ndistributed in both experimental and simulated\ndata for b = 1\/3 (Fig. 4C, top). The mean interval\nbetween incomplete switches from the CCW\n(CW) state increased with CCW (CW) bias\n(Fig. 4C, bottom), with broad agreement between\nexperimental and simulated data. The number of\nincomplete switches detected clearly depends on\nthe parameter b. \u03a4he mean interval length for the\nlargest data bin (CW bias 0.2) decreased linearly\nwith b in both experiment and simulation,\nbecoming identical to the mean interval length\nbetween complete switches as b\u2192 \u20132\/3 (Fig. 4C,\nbottom, inset). For these values of b, intervals\nremained exponentially distributed (fig. S9). No\nattempt was made to adjust the model parameters\nto fit the experimental data on incomplete\nswitches: The agreement may improve upon an\nexhaustive search of the model\u2019s parameter space.\nBacterial flagellar switching has classically\nbeen understood in terms of the two-state\nconcerted allosteric model (16). A recent study\nused the conformational spread model to explain\nthe dependence of switching rates on load (30).\nWe have observed multistate switching, which is\nthe signature of conformational spread. Switch\nevents are not instantaneous but show a broadly\ndistributed duration, and incomplete switching is\nprevalent. Exponentially distributed intervals\nbetween complete switches demonstrate that\nswitching approximates a two-state Poisson\nprocess at lower time resolution, despite the\nunderlying multistate nature of the switch, in\nagreement with early two-state phenomeno-\nlogical models (18, 19). Conformational spread\nis able to reproduce these observations with\nremarkable quantitative agreement, despite the\nvery limited search of the model parameter space\nand using only data collected at neutral bias to\nguide this search. As a final comparison, we\nconstructed a Hill plot (Fig. 4D) to confirm the\nsensitivity of the simulated switch. The model\naccurately reproduces previously measured val-\nues of the binding (12, 13) and switching (10)\ncooperativity, with Hill coefficients 3.5 and 9.4,\nrespectively. Taken together, this is compelling\nevidence that the conformational spread model\naccurately represents the flagellar switch.\nRecent advances in resolving the functional\nstates of a number of other proteins have\nnecessitated extensions of the classical models of\nallostery, even to describe relatively small protein\ncomplexes (31, 32).Modern theoretical treatments\nof allosteric regulation indicate that the conforma-\ntional heterogeneity that results from stochastic\ncoupling, both between different subunits and\nbetween binding and conformation, may be a\nselectable trait (33). With the classical models\nencompassed at the parameter space limits of the\nconformational spread model, which can be\nextended to geometries other than a ring (4, 8),\nwe expect the model to be generally useful in\nunderstanding protein cooperativity and signal\nregulation.\nReferences and Notes\n1.

Green,5 Ming Luo,5 Z. Hong Zhou1,2,3,4*\nVesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a bullet-shaped rhabdovirus and a model system of\nnegative-strand RNA viruses. Through direct visualization by means of cryo\u2013electron microscopy,\nwe show that each virion contains two nested, left-handed helices: an outer helix of matrix\nprotein M and an inner helix of nucleoprotein N and RNA. M has a hub domain with\nfour contact sites that link to neighboring M and N subunits, providing rigidity by clamping\nadjacent turns of the nucleocapsid. Side-by-side interactions between neighboring N subunits are\ncritical for the nucleocapsid to form a bullet shape, and structure-based mutagenesis results\nsupport this description. Together, our data suggest a mechanism of VSV assembly in which the\nnucleocapsid spirals from the tip to become the helical trunk, both subsequently framed and\nrigidified by the M layer.\nVesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an en-veloped, bullet-shaped, non-segmented,negative-strand RNA virus (NSRV) be-\nlonging to the rhabdovirus family, which includes\nthe rabies virus. Because some attenuated VSV\nstrains are nontoxic to normal tissue, VSV has\ntherapeutic potential as an anticancer agent and\nvaccine vector (1, 2). Furthermore, pseudotypes\nof VSV carrying receptors for HIV proteins can\nselectively target and kill HIV-1\u2013infected cells\nand control HIV-1 infection (3, 4).\nWhereas many other NSRVs are pleomorphic,\nVSV has a rigid \u201cbullet\u201d shape. Attempts to\nvisualize its organization by means of negatively\nstained electron microscopy (EM) have resulted\nin limited two-dimensional (2D) pictures: The\nvirion has a lipid envelope (decorated with G\nspikes) that encloses a nucleocapsid composed of\nRNA plus nucleoprotein N and an associated\nmatrix formed by M proteins. In recent years,\ncrystal structures of components of VSV have\nbeen determined: the C-terminal core domain\nMCTD of the matrix protein (M) (5, 6), the\nnucleoprotein (N) (7), the partial structure of\nphosphoprotein (P) (8), the complex of N with the\nC-terminal of P (9), and the two forms of the\nectodomain of the glycoprotein (G) (10, 11).\nThe large polymerase (L) still awaits structure\ndetermination. However, how these proteins as-\nsemble into the characteristic rigid bullet-shaped\nvirion has not been clear. Here, we report the 3D\nstructure of the helical portion (the \u201ctrunk\u201d) of\nthe VSV virion as determined by means of cryo-\nelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) as well as a study\nof the bullet-shaped tip from an integrated image-\nprocessing approach. This analysis leads us to\npropose amodel for assembly of the virus with its\norigin at the bullet tip.\nCryo-EM images of purified VSV virions\nshow intact bullet-shaped particles almost devoid\nof truncated or defective interference particles\n(Fig. 1A). The reconstructed map of the virion\ntrunk (Fig. 1B and movies S1 and S2) has an\neffective resolution of 10.6 A\u02da based on the 0.5\nFourier shell correlation coefficient criterion (fig.\nS2). We were able to dock crystal structures of\nthe C-terminal domain of M [Protein Data Bank\n(PDB)1LG7 or 2W2R] (5, 6) and all of N (PDB\n2GIC) (7) into our cryo-EM density map. The\nmatching of several high-density regions in the\ncryo-EM map with a helices in the docked\natomic models (Fig. 2A, M, and Fig. 3A, N)\nsupports the validity of the cryo-EM map. These\ndockings also establish the chirality of the\nstructure.\nWhen reconstructed with a helical symmetry\nimposed (12), the 3D map includes an outermost\nlipid bilayer, a middle layer composed of a helix-\nbased mesh of M, and an innermost condensed\nnucleocapsid composed of a helically organized\nstring of N subunits and RNA (Fig. 1, B and C,\nand fig. S3). [The M (Fig. 2A) and N (Fig. 3A)\nlayers were identified on the basis of their close\nmatch with their crystal structures of M (5, 6) and\nN (7).] Each of the N and M layers consists of a\nsingle helix (1-start helix). Although the interior\nof the nucleocapsid contains a denser region than\nbackground, no density was found that was rea-\nsonably attributable to individual P or L subunits,\nsuggesting that those are organized in a lower-\nsymmetric or asymmetric fashion [supporting\nonline material (SOM) text]. A layer of density\noutside the membrane may be identified as G\nprotein (fig. S1) because the G protein is the only\nenvelope protein in VSV. However, individual G\nspikes cannot be resolved in this layer, possibly\nbecause of flexibly attached ectodomains or in-\nconsistent symmetry, and this layer of density\n1Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular\nGenetics, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), Los\nAngeles, CA 90095-7364, USA. 2California NanoSystems\nInstitute, UCLA, 237 BSRB, 615 Charles E.
