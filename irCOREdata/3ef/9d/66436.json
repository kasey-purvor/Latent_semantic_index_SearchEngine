However, the best efficiencies achieved so\nfar are still about 50% of the theoretically possible perfor-\nmance. Among the approaches used to reach this goal, only a\nfew dealt with the doping of either the CdTe absorber layer\nor the CdS window layer during their growth.1,2 Unfortu-\nnately, these attempts led to conflicting results concerning\nthe effect that such a doping could have on the behavior of\nthe resulting device. Indeed, Boyle et al. studied CdTe\/CdS\nsolar cell devices and concluded that there was neither an\nobvious correlation between the reagent concentrations in the\nCdS bath and the solar cell efficiency of CdTe\/CdS devices,\nnor a straightforward relationship between the impurities\nprofiled in the device and the characteristics of the latter.2\nSimilarly, Altosaar et al. recently reported on CdS films pre-\npared by chemical bath deposition from solutions containing\ndifferent donor impurities and found that the performance of\nsolar cells made with the resulting different CdS layers was\nnot noticeably affected.3 This was attributed to the fact that,\nfor these cells, the CdS layer is not necessarily part of the\nheterojunction with the absorber layer, and that a working\nburied homojunction exists instead, where the n-type region\nis formed on the surface of the p-type absorber.3 However, it\nwas recently shown that the presence of impurities in doped\nCdS-based thin films leads to an enhancement of the photo-\nsensitivity while the photovoltaic efficiency of these films in\na metal-semiconductor junction is decreased.1\nIn recent works, we reported secondary ion mass spec-\ntrometry \u0001SIMS\u0002 studies of CdTe\/CdS\/TCO solar cell struc-\ntures depth profiled throughout using quantitative SIMS from\nthe back4 and the front side.5 These investigations demon-\nstrated the existence and importance of impurities in the so-\nlar cell structures and elucidated the main sources of impu-\nrities. We have also shown that the subsequent overgrowth of\nthe CdTe absorber layer on top of the CdS window layer\nsubstantially affects both the concentration and the profile of\nthe impurity species present in the as-grown CdS \u0001Ref. 6\u0002.\nIn recent reports by different groups, the role of oxygen\nin CdTe solar cells was mainly investigated for devices post-\ngrowth processed in oxygen-containing environments.7\u20139\nThis investigation aimed at studying the effect, on the char-\nacteristics and performance of CdTe\/CdS solar cell devices,\nof an in situ doping of the CdTe absorber layer with oxygen.\nIt was found that the introduction of oxygen into the CdTe\nlayer during its growth improves the efficiency of these de-\nvices as compared to the devices without the addition of\noxygen.\nThe devices were grown on sapphire substrates in an\nattempt to avoid the impurity species such as Na, and prob-\nably also Si and O, that were shown to be more likely origi-\nnating from the commonly used glass substrate.4,5 These im-\npurities are known to have a doping effect in both CdTe and\nCdS materials. The sapphire substrates were 2.5\u00012.5 cm2\nand 0.5 mm thick, and were thoroughly cleaned prior to the\nstructure deposition. The transparent conducting oxide layer\nwas deposited by reactive sputtering at a substrate tempera-\nture around 450 \u00b0C and consisted of a fluorine-doped indium\ntin oxide \u0001ITO:F\u0002 film \u0001\u00051.2 \u0002m thick\u0002 followed by a tin\noxide \u0001SnO2\u0002 film of about 300 nm thickness. Ar+O2 atmo-\nsphere was used for both layers and CHF3 was added in the\ncase of ITO:F. The CdS:F layer \u0001\u000580 nm\u0002 was also depos-\nited by reactive sputtering using Ar and CHF3 flows at a\nsubstrate temperature of 200 \u00b0C and a total pressure of 5\n\u000110\u22123 mbar. Close-space sublimation \u0001CSS\u0002 was used for\nthe growth of the 6\u20138 \u0002m thick CdTe layer. During the CdTe\ngrowth of one of the devices, oxygen was intentionally in-\ncorporated in situ by letting O2 gas into the CSS chamber.\nFor the purpose of comparison, the CdTe layer of the other\ndevice was grown under the same conditions but without\noxygen introduction. Both device structures then underwent\na CdCl2 processing via thermal evaporation of CdCl2 on top\nof the structures and air annealing \u0001400 \u00b0C for 30 min\u0002, fol-a\u0002Electronic mail: m.emziane@dur.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 87, 261901 \u00012005\u0002\n0003-6951\/2005\/87\u000226\u0001\/261901\/2\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics87, 261901-1\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

The back contact\nwas finally deposited by sputtering and consisted of a Sb2Te3\nlayer at 300 \u00b0C and a Mo layer at room temperature. I-V\nmeasurements were carried out using an Oriel solar simulator\nto determine the device parameters under standard condi-\ntions, i.e., AM 1.5 and a light power of 100 mW\/cm2.\nTable I recapitulates the parameters of 1 cm2 solar cell\nfrom both devices grown, respectively, with and without\noxygen introduction into CdTe. Compared to the device\ngrown without introduction of oxygen into CdTe, all the so-\nlar cell parameters, i.e., Voc , Jsc, fill factor, and efficiency, are\nenhanced for the sample with oxygen-containing CdTe layer\nas a direct consequence of oxygen incorporation. Further-\nmore, both samples received a light soaking at a temperature\nof 100 \u00b0C and 20 suns for 20\u201330 min, and this did not alter\nthese parameters. Figure 1 shows the quantitative SIMS\ndepth profiles of O and Cl recorded, starting from the CdTe\nsurface through to the TCO layer for both devices grown\nwith and without oxygen incorporation in CdTe. The layer\ndepth scales were calibrated according to the sputter rate in\nCdTe, and the SIMS data quantified using CdTe relative sen-\nsitivity factors as extracted from CdTe implants. Figure 1\nalso shows that the CdTe\/CdS interface is located at a depth\nof about 8 \u0002m from the CdTe free surface. The concentra-\ntion of O and Cl in the CdS window layer could not be\ndetermined since this thin \u0001\u000580 nm\u0002 layer was not resolved.\nThe concentration of oxygen in the CdTe layer is about 1\norder of magnitude higher \u0001from \u00051019 to \u00051020 cm\u22123\u0002 es-\npecially from the middle of the layer through to the\nCdTe\/CdS interface, when it is intentionally in situ intro-\nduced compared to the device without oxygen incorporation.\nThe near surface region of the CdTe layer exhibits a concen-\ntration of O around 5\u00011019 cm\u22123. Chlorine, however, is\nfound to have a concentration in CdTe on average 2\u20135 times\nhigher when oxygen is introduced into the CdTe layer during\nits growth. As for the distribution of these two elements\nwithin the CdTe layer, O and Cl show rather flat profiles for\nthe sample without O incorporation while, for the sample\nwith O incorporation, they exhibit nonuniform distributions\nparticularly for Cl. This indicates that the in situ doping of\nthe CdTe layer with O is not only efficient but also favors the\nincorporation of Cl into the CdTe layer following the CdCl2\nactivation process. We believe that oxygen incorporation in\nCdTe and the enhanced concentration of Cl in CdTe related\nto the presence of oxygen may both contribute to the im-\nprovement of the solar device parameters. In other words, at\nleast in part, O and consequently Cl are not neutral in CdTe\nbut seem to be electrically active and\/or form electrically\nactive complexes within the CdTe absorber layer, leading\nultimately to an enhanced overall performance of the\nCdTe\/CdS solar cell. This seems to be the case despite the\nwell-known compensation effect in CdTe. Although O is iso-\nelectronic, its role in CdTe has been a subject of considerable\ndiscussion.7\u201310 Cl can be incorporated as either a donor,\nsingle substitutional impurity, or as an acceptor, the Cl\nA-center. The mechanism through which the device improve-\nment occurs deserves further investigation.\nIn summary, we have shown that an intentional in situ\nintroduction of O in the CdTe absorber layer of the\nCdTe\/CdS solar cell device leads not only to an order of\nmagnitude increase in the amount of O but also to an en-\nhanced Cl concentration in CdTe as a consequence of O\npresence. This increase in the concentration of both O and Cl\nin CdTe was shown to affect directly the resulting device by\nimproving all its parameters, and leading to an efficiency\nof 14% compared to 11.5% when O is not intentionally\nincorporated in CdTe during its growth.\nThe authors are thankful to the EPSRC \u0001UK\u0002 for finan-\ncial support through Grant No. GR\/R39283\/01.\n1T.
