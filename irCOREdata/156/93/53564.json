Metadata (information \nabout the data) is undergoing its own transformation \nin order to accompany the rapid and extensive \ndissemination of these data. This chapter describes \nthe types of data historically and currently produced \nby geomagnetic observatories and introduces new \ndata types such as one-second and quasi-absolute \ndata recently discussed at the 11th IAGA Scientific \nAssembly in Sopron, Hungary. We review the \navailability of these data types from the World Data \nCentres, INTERMAGNET and other sources. \nFinally, we discuss developments in metadata \ndescribing the current efforts in the geomagnetism \ncommunity to gather, store and distribute this \ninformation about the data to better assist scientific \ndiscovery. \n7.1 Introduction \nMagnetic observatories continuously measure the \nstrength and direction of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field \n(Macmillan, 2007). The availability of data from \nthese observatories has evolved greatly with the \ntransition from the production of analogue \nphotographic magnetograms to digital electronic  \n \n \nrecordings, and the development of technological \ncapabilities such as the Personal Computer (PC); CD- \nand DVD-ROMs for the inexpensive archiving of \nlarge quantities of data; and the internet for instant \nglobal access to information of every sort. Metadata \n(information about the data) are undergoing their own \ntransformation in order to accompany the rapid and \nextensive dissemination of these various data sets. \nMetadata describes the content, quality, originator, \nand other characteristics of a data set, and supports \nthe proper interpretation and use of the data. \nFor more than a century, magnetic observatory \ndata were only available on printed materials as \nanalogue traces on photographic paper known as \nmagnetograms, products derived from those traces, \nsuch as temporal averages (hourly, daily, etc.) and \nmagnetic activity indices. Metadata consisted of \nyearbooks in which information about the \nobservatories was provided, and copies of these \nvarious data products were reproduced in these \nbooks. The launching of the International \nGeophysical Year (IGY) in 1957 brought with it the \nbeginning of the World Data Centres (WDC) \nestablished as central repositories where scientists \ncould go to obtain data from a number of locations \nworldwide.  \nIn the late 1960\u2019s, magnetic observatories began \nconverting to digital electronic equipment and a true \nrevolution in data types and availability was \nunderway. The individual traces could now be kept \nseparate (traces often crossed each other and became \n2 \nconfused on magnetograms) and the standard \nobservatory data product changed from hourly means \nto minute means. Most significantly, these data could \nnow be collected, manipulated, archived and \ndisseminated using computers.  \nThe emergence of the PC in the 1980\u2019s, and the \ndevelopment of CD-ROMs for data storage saw the \nbeginning of \u201csmall science\u201d where individual \nscientists were able to have large quantities of data \navailable to study for minimal cost. In 1990, for \nexample, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) \nproduced the first CD-ROM of one-minute magnetic \nobservatory data for a 5-year period (1985-1989) \nfrom the USGS network of (then) 13 stations (Herzog \nand Lupica, 1992), and served as the model for the \nproduction of a series of CD-ROMs by \nINTERMAGNET containing a global set of \nobservatory data.  \nDuring the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, significant \nadvances were also made in the timeliness of data \ndelivery through the use of satellites. Data Collection \nPlatforms (DCPs), equipped with satellite \ntransmission systems, began delivering data from the \nobservatories to data processing centres, with delays \nof the order of tens of minutes. An organisation \ncalled INTERMAGNET was formed which began \ntransferring data from observatories worldwide using \nsatellites, and which developed Geomagnetic \nInformation Nodes (GINs) where users could obtain \npreliminary data from the participating stations \nquickly by means of email requests.  \nBut without question the greatest advancement in \ndata availability has come about from the impact of \nthe World Wide Web (WWW) as a data discovery \nand distribution tool for the internet. Beginning in \n1992, when WWW access became more broadly \navailable to the general public, the growth in use of \nthe WWW for access to data has been astonishing. \nToday virtually every institution, public and private, \nhas a website with the capability of providing access \nto their information and data. As magnetic \nobservatories have progressed in their abilities to \ncollect and process data faster and with higher \ncadences (one-second data, for example), these data \nhave also become ever more readily available. This \nchange has implications for traditional WDC roles of \ndata discovery and delivery, but also for long-term \ndata archive. \nIn this chapter we will look at some of these \ndevelopments and advances in data and metadata \ntypes and how they have been made available. Using \nan historical perspective, and with the help of results \npresented at the 11th IAGA Scientific Assembly held \nin Sopron, Hungary in 2009, we hope to provide an \naccount of where we are today regarding these topics.  \n \n7.2 Data Types \n7.2.1 Printed Media \nFrom the earliest days of magnetic observatory \noperations, data were collected on paper records of \none sort or another. Variations in the magnetic field \nwere recorded as continuous traces on photographic \npaper. Observations of the absolute magnitudes of the \nfield components were recorded and provided \ncalibration reference data with which to convert the \nanalogue trace amplitudes into magnetic field values. \nThese observations could then be reduced to produce \ntables of results at various time-scales: hourly, daily, \nmonthly, annual. In time, range data started to be \npresented and then activity measures, such as the K-\nindex (1939) were developed. Magnetic records also \nincluded absolute measurements, information on the \nbaseline used and indications of the most quiet and \nactive days (from 1911). \nThese records were presented in the form of \nyearbooks. These yearbooks and photographic \nanalogue traces are archived and are available from \ndifferent sources and in a variety of formats. Many \nmagnetogram traces are stored on microfilm and \nmicrofiche. In this digital age we are keen to preserve \nthese, often, fragile documents and allow greater \naccess for analysis of these historical records. Some \nhave been scanned as images and some have been \nentered directly to form digitised electronic files. \n7.2.1.1 Eye-Observations \nThe earliest records from magnetic observatories \nwere from eye-observations made manually by \nobservers at set times during each day. For example \nat Greenwich observatory observations were made at \n2-hourly intervals except on \u201cterm-days\u201d when \nmeasurements were every 5 minutes. At Colaba \nobservatory observations were made hourly except \nduring disturbed times when they were every 15 \nminutes or every 5 minutes during severely disturbed \nconditions. Fig 7.1 shows the 5-minute eye-\nobservations for Colaba during the September 1859 \n\u201cCarrington Storm\u201d. The laborious nature of these \nmanual observations encouraged the development of \nautomatic recording devices. In 1847 Brooke \ndesigned the automatic photographic magnetograph \nthat was to form the standard technique for \nobservatory operations for over a century (Brooke, \n1847). \n \nFig 7.1 Eye-observations made with Grubb\u2019s magnetometer at Colaba Observatory for 1-2 September 1859. The observation \nfrequency increases from 15-minute to 5-minute observations as the severity of the storm increases (see Tsurutani et al., 2003). \n(Credit: Indian Institute of Geomagnetism) \n7.2.1.2 Magnetograms \nFor more than a century, the changes in the Earth\u2019s \nmagnetic field have been recorded at observatories as \nanalogue traces on sheets of photographic paper. \nUnder darkroom conditions, mirrors attached to \nmagnets suspended from quartz filament fibres, \nknown as variometers, reflect light from a source \nthrough a horizontal lens and onto a sheet of \nphotographic paper generally mounted on a drum that \ncompletes a rotation once a day. Time marks on the \nhour, generated by a light flash, provide a temporal \nreference. These paper records are known as normal \nmagnetograms. There are also two auxiliary types of \nmagnetograms produced at some stations: storm \nmagnetograms, with reduced sensitivity, provide \nbetter amplitude resolution during periods of \nenhanced magnetic activity; and rapid-run \nmagnetograms are recorded on drums that rotate \nmore than once a day as the drum moved laterally, \nproviding greater time resolution. In addition to the \nmirrors mounted on the magnets in the variometer, \nstationary mirrors are also used to reflect light onto \nthe recording drum and produce a fixed (non-\nvarying) trace known as a baseline. A schematic \nillustration of this arrangement can be seen in Fig \n7.2a. An example of a normal magnetogram, from \nKakioka, Japan can be seen in Fig7.2b. Although still \nin use today at some observatories, these systems \nhave become less common as the magnetic field is \nmore often recorded using digital systems as \ndescribed in section 7. 2.2. \n \n \n \nFig. 7.2 (a) Schematic of an Eschenhagen type magnetic variometer (for details see Wienert, 1970) (b) Normal-run magnetogram \nrecorded at Kakioka observatory on November 24, 1924. (Credit: WDC for Geomagnetism, Kyoto) \n(a) \n(b) \n7.2.1.3 Calibration Data \nIn addition to the magnetogram traces continuously \nrecording the variation in the magnetic field periodic \nmeasurements (generally weekly) of the absolute \nvalues of the magnetic field vector components were \nmade using a variety of special instruments. \nFurthermore, special deflection magnets of known \nmagnetic moment were used to obtain conversion \nfactors, known as scale values, to convert the traces \nfrom units of distance to units of magnetic field \nstrength. Knowing the absolute values of the field \ncomponents for a given time interval, one could then \ncombine these with the scale values to derive an \nabsolute value for the baseline. With this, a calibrated \nvalue of the magnetic field at any point along the \nmagnetogram trace could then be determined to \nconvert the analogue traces into definitive magnetic \nvalues.  \n7.2.1.4 Hourly Values \nAfter the magnetograms were developed, an observer \nwould use a scaling glass to estimate the amplitude of \neach trace for each hour from its respective baseline. \nUsing the calibration data, these could then be \nconverted to hourly values of the magnetic field. In \nthe earliest days of observatory operations these \nhourly values were often spot observations taken \nevery 60 minutes on the hour. Later, just after the \nturn of the 20th century, observatories began to \nestimate the average amplitudes over the whole hour \nto provide hourly mean values (HMVs). The first \nHMVs were calculated by Schmidt (1905) for \nPotsdam observatory with many others following suit \nshortly afterwards. These HMVs referred to the \nperiod of sixty minutes from the start of the hour, \nresulting in a mean centred on the following half-\nhour (i.e. a mean labelled as hour 10 is centred at 10h \n30m). Convenient for hand-scaling between the hour \nmarks on a magnetogram, this method continued into \nthe digital era, thus ensuring homogeneity throughout \nthe HMV data sets.  \nUntil the advent of digital recording systems \nHMVs were the primary data product from magnetic \nobservatories. Both the spot hourly values and the \nHMVs were usually compiled into monthly tables as \nshown in Fig 7.3. These tables were published in \nobservatory yearbooks along with the information \nabout the values that would enable distinction \nbetween spot and mean values.  Unfortunately there \nwere cases of insufficient or incorrect information \nbeing recorded, causing the potential for incorrect \nconclusions to be reached by researchers using these \ndata sets and underlining the importance of clear and \naccurate metadata (see section 7.4). \n \n \nFig. 7.3 A table of hourly mean values from Honolulu observatory for the H component in June 1964. Each column shows the hour \nin UT and each row indicates the day of the month. These values are summed at the end of each row and a monthly sum and mean \nare produced. The table also indicates the five internationally quiet (Q) and disturbed (S) days. \n7.2.1.5 Magnetic Activity Indices \nIn addition to the values of the magnetic field \ncomponents themselves, efforts were made to \ndevelop indicators of the various levels of \ngeomagnetic activity. A comprehensive guide to this \nsubject is given in the chapter \u201cGeomagnetic Indices\u201d \nby Menvielle et al. (2010) within this book and in the \nclassical text by Mayaud (1980). Here, we mention \nonly a few of the most commonly used indices that \nwere historically derived from and originally stored \nas analogue records. \nThe 3-hour K-index is a quantitative measure of \nlocal magnetic activity based upon the range of \nfluctuations in the observatory traces over 3 hours. It \nuses a semi-logarithmic scale from 0 to 9, with 0 \nindicating completely quiet conditions and 9, highly \ndisturbed conditions. It is intended to measure \ngeomagnetic disturbances outside the normal diurnal \nquiet time variations and so these had to be accounted \nfor by the experienced hand-scaler. The largest range \nof either the horizontal component (H) or declination \n(D) trace (originally the vertical component (Z) was \nalso used) is selected. K-indices can also be \nconverted into eight 3-hour equivalent linear \namplitudes, ak, and summed, these provide a local \ndaily amplitude index, Ak. \nThe scaling of K-indices at a wide network of \nobservatories enabled the derivation of various K \nbased planetary indices adopted by IAGA: Kp from \nwhich ap is derived; am; and aa. The planetary \nactivity index, Kp, is derived from the standardised \nK-indices of 13, mostly mid-latitude, observatories \n(Bartels et al. 1939). The name Kp comes from the \nGerman phrase \"planetarische Kennziffer\", meaning \nplanetary index. It is designed to monitor the \ninfluence of the auroral electrojet current system, and \nthe magnetospheric ring current and field-aligned \ncurrents. As with Ak, ap is the 3-hourly equivalent \nplanetary amplitude derived from Kp and Ap is the \ndaily average of the eight values. Kp, ap and Ap \nextend back to 1932. Although much used by the \nexternal magnetic field communities, these indices \nare generally considered to have two main \nweaknesses: one is the poor global distribution of the \nobservatory network used; and the second is that the \nlength of the time series is insufficient for century-\nlong studies. The first was solved by the design of the \nam-index (Mayaud, 1967), which uses a more \nextensive network of observatories and is available \nfrom 1959. The latter was solved by the design of a \nmuch simpler K based planetary index, the aa-index \n(Mayaud, 1972). Using only two near-antipodal \nobservatories it could be extended back further in \ntime to 1868. \nAnother important measure of magnetic activity is \nthe Disturbed storm time, Dst-index (Sugiura, 1964). \nThis hourly index is based on the average value of H \nmeasured hourly, as described in 7.2.1.4, at four near-\nequatorial geomagnetic observatories. It was \noriginally introduced to measure the magnitude of the \ncurrent which produces the symmetric disturbance \nfield, but is often used to estimate the strength of \nmagnetic storms caused largely by the \nmagnetospheric ring current. This (mainly) westward \nflowing ring current causes H to be depressed from \nits normal level. Dst can be used as a measure of \nmagnetic storm intensity because the strength of the \nsurface magnetic field at low latitudes is inversely \nproportional to the energy content of the ring current.  \n7.2.1.6 Yearbooks \nEvery year the results from a magnetic observatory \nwould be collated and published in the form of a \nyearbook. Along with photographic magnetometer \ntraces yearbooks are one of the primary sources of \nprinted geomagnetic observatory data.  The type of \ndata published in yearbooks has changed over the \nyears as instrumentation has developed and methods \nwere standardised, but all share commonality. \nGenerally, yearbooks contain descriptive text \ndescribing the observatory; this may detail its \nlocation, housing, staff, instrumentation, and data \nprocessing methods. It also contains the final \ndefinitive measurements and results from the \nobservatory. As an example, yearbooks from \nGreenwich observatory originally contained results \ncalled \u2018indicators of the magnetometers\u2019; firstly from \neye-observations and then taken directly from the \nphotographic magnetometer records. These were \npublished alongside records of magnetic dip (these \ndays normally referred to as inclination, I) and \nabsolute measures of H. In later years hourly, daily, \nmonthly and annual means were presented alongside \nK-indices, diurnal ranges, absolute measurements, \nbaseline information and, sometimes, selective \nmagnetograms and descriptive notes of magnetic \ndisturbances. The results for many observatories were \noften published alongside meteorological \nobservations. \nIt is worth noting when examining data from the \nearliest yearbooks that care must be taken regarding \ntime recordings. Prior to the adoption of standard \ntime-zones and Universal Time in 1884, time \nconventions at each observatory could vary \nconsiderably. Some used a local civil time where a \nday started at midnight whereas others used an \nastronomical time where a day started at noon or \nsome other local convention (Boteler, 2006). \nPresently, the tradition of publishing yearbooks is \nstill practiced by many observatories worldwide. \nHowever since advent of digital distribution of results \nthis practice has been discontinued at some \nobservatories. Yearbooks continue to be the best \nsource of valuable metadata on observatory practice, \n7 \ninstrumentation, data processing and quality control \nand the publication of these are encouraged by IAGA \n(Jankowski and Sucksdorff, 1996). \n7.2.1.7 Conservation and Conversion of \nPrinted Media \nDuring classical, analogue operations magnetograms, \nHMV tables, K-index tables, and calibration data \nmade up the core of data types produced at magnetic \nobservatories, although other derived products such \nas sudden storm commencements (ssc) and magnetic \npulsations (Matsushita and Campbell, 1967) were \nalso generated at some stations. At some WDCs the \nvarious paper products were archived onto microfilm \nrolls and microfiche cards. WDCs periodically \npublished individual and joint catalogues identifying \navailable data at each of the geomagnetic data centres \n(e.g. Abston et al., 1985). Fig 7.4 shows the holdings \nof analogue and digital data at WDC-Kyoto and \nillustrates that the digital-age of magnetic \nobservatories only began in the mid-1980s. There are \nvast amounts of data \u2018locked away\u2019 in analogue form \nthat is difficult to access and analyse in this digital \nera. Special procedures are required to preserve these \ndata and allow electronic access. \nMuch effort has been made over the years to \ndigitise magnetogram traces (e.g. Curto et al., 1996), \nbut this has proved to be a challenging task. During \nmagnetically active times, generally of most interest \nto researchers, the traces for the different components \noften cross each other making it difficult to identify \nwhich is which. Nonetheless, at the 11th IAGA \nScientific Assembly, the British Geological Survey \n(BGS) reported on a programme to digitise \nmagnetograms from the UK observatories dating \nback to 1848 (Clarke et al., 2009). The primary goal \nof the project is one of conservation, with the capture \nof the magnetograms as images (Fig 7.5), which will \nalso enable increased access to the scientific \ncommunity. The second aim is to develop a semi-\nautomated procedure to convert the images into \ndigital values with a greater time resolution than has \npreviously been reported. \nIn addition, many of the WDCs discussed in \nsection 7.3 of this chapter have been involved in a \nspecial project funded by an International Council for \nScience (ICSU) grant. This \u201cMagnetogram Rescue \nProject\u201d involved WDCs Kyoto, Moscow, and \nMumbai and aimed to locate old magnetograms and \nconvert them into digital images (Iyemori, 2005). The \nresults of this project are available from these WDCs. \nThe observatory community has invested most of \nits efforts in this area to convert the tables of data in \nyearbooks and other bulletins (for example, HMVs, \nK-indices) into digital electronic values. Various \nattempts have been made at this, including the \nscanning techniques of Optical Character \nRecognition (OCR). The unreliability of this \nprocedure, especially for HMV tables (generally due \nto the high variability of different typefaces and \nhand-written entries in the tables), caused these \nefforts to be directed more toward manual entry and \nchecking (see for example, Nagarajan, 2008; \nFouassier and Chulliat, 2009; Nevanlinna and \nH\u00e4kkinen, 2010). While the reliability of this manual \nprocedure is very good, it is also labour intensive and \ncan therefore be expensive. As a compromise, and in \norder to make the data accessible electronically, \nmany data sets have been, and are being, scanned into \nimages that will at least allow for computer \nmanipulation by researchers.  \n \nFig 7.4 The number of analogue normal-run magnetograms and digital one-minute data held at the WDC-Kyoto.

Digital image capture of historical magnetograms (Copyright: BGS\/NERC) \n7.2.2 Electronic Media \nThe earliest digital electronic data from magnetic \nobservatories were recorded in 1969 from two French \nstations, Dumont d'Urville (DRV) in Antarctica, and \nPort-aux-Fran\u00e7ais (PAF) on the Kerguelen Islands in \nthe Indian Ocean. These stations used photoelectric \nfeedback and Cesium vapour magnetometers to \nsample the northerly intensity (X), easterly intensity \n(Y) components, and total intensity (F) of the \nmagnetic field at one-minute intervals. The \nintroduction of the triaxial fluxgate magnetometer \n(see for example, Trigg et al., 1971), and use of \nanalogue-to-digital converters in data loggers by the \nearly 1970\u2019s, ushered in the true digital electronic age \nin magnetic observatory operations. These devices \nsampled the field multiple times per minute which \nwere then filtered to produce one-minute values. This \nalso was the beginning of one-minute values \nbecoming the standard published magnetic \nobservatory results. Many institutes added proton \nprecession scalar magnetometers at their stations \nwhich provided separate measurements of the \nabsolute F, and also served as a reference to compare \nwith the fluxgate vector data. Observatory data \nquality is discussed in the chapter \u201cImprovements in \ngeomagnetic observatory data quality\u201d by Reda et al. \n(2010) within this book, where a full description of \nmodern magnetic observatory instrumentation, \noperations and data processing is provided. \n7.2.2.1 Minute Means \nVarious brands of linear core, three-component \nfluxgate magnetometers are installed at observatories \nthroughout the world. Originally these instruments \nrecorded an output voltage proportional to the \n9 \nstrength of the ambient magnetic field. Using the \ncalibration data, the voltages were converted to \nmagnetic field values. The output from a fluxgate \nmagnetometer can be sampled at various frequencies; \ninitially systems were set to sample every 10-seconds \nbut 1-second sampling is now more common. \nRegular manual absolute observations are still \nrequired to derive baseline values for the fluxgate \ndata. Combined, these provide definitive data (see for \nexample, Turner et al. 2007). Early on, data were \nstored on magnetic tape and processed to derive 2.5-\nminute means. Over time these faded from use and \none-minute means became the standard. These \ndefinitive digital one-minute data form the basis for \neasy computation of various time averages, including \nhourly, daily, monthly, and annual means.  \nAs with the analogue records, the delay in the \navailability of early digital data could be \nconsiderable. This was due to several factors \nincluding the fact that recording tapes at many \nstations were left for weeks before they were \nretrieved. Even today, it requires several months of \nweekly absolute observations, to enable the \nproduction of reliable final baselines, before the final \ndefinitive data can be delivered to the WDCs.  \nWith the many advantages that digital data \nprovided, and the proliferation of low-cost \ncomputational capabilities, the demand for these one-\nminute data grew. New DCPs began allowing access \nremotely through modems, and requests for the data \nrapidly increased. Many researchers, for example in \nthe space physics community, did not require \ndefinitive data as they are only interested in the \nvariations in the magnetic field. The internet, with its \nemail and FTP capabilities, allowed institutions to \nsend preliminary data to users more quickly and \nefficiently. By 1991, INTERMAGNET had \nestablished GINs where a global collection of \nobservatory one-minute data could be retrieved. \nDemand from industry for observatory data also \ngrew. One example is its use, in near real-time, to \nimprove the accuracy of bore-hole surveys in off-\nshore directional drilling operations carried out by oil \nand gas companies (Reay et al., 2005). Today, one-\nminute data are available from a multitude of \nlocations through websites within minutes of the \nmeasurements being made.  \nHowever, three important points concerning the \none-minute data should be emphasised. First, in the \nearly 1990\u2019s magnetometers and data collection \nsystems were developed that produced an output in \nmagnetic units rather than voltage units (Narod, \n2009). The field measured in this way may appear to \nbe the correct value that one might expect for a given \nlocation, but it is not. There are correcting factors, \nsuch as zero-level offsets and orthogonality issues \nthat must be corrected for with the use of baselines in \nthe calibration data. With the widespread \nproliferation of preliminary one-minute data, one \ncould potentially mistake the preliminary data for the \ndefinitive data. The preliminary values can be as little \nas a few to as many as hundreds of nT apart from the \ndefinitive values. Nowadays INTERMAGNET \nclearly separates each type of data on their website \nand the IAGA-2002 data format explicitly states the \ntype of data both in the filename and the headers. \nThis gives another good example of the power of \nmetadata. \nSecondly, early on, the one-minute means were \noften computed using simple arithmetic mean \nalgorithms, sometimes referred to as a \u201cbox-car\u201d \nmean. However, when converting from analogue to \ndigital, in order to preserve the full information in the \nanalogue signal, it is necessary to sample at least \ntwice the maximum frequency of the analogue signal. \nSampling at lower rates introduces erroneous \ncomponents due to aliasing. A numerical filter can \nminimise the effects of aliasing in the construction of \none-minute values from one-second samples. A \nGaussian filter is often used for this purpose, \nalthough other types meeting the same requirements \nare also used. INTERMAGNET now requires \nnumerical filtering of one-minute data as a criterion \nfor attaining INTERMAGNET Magnetic \nObservatory (IMO) certification and encourages the \nuse of a Gaussian filter using 90 one-second samples. \nThe USGS, for example, began applying a Gaussian \nfilter to derive its one-minute data from 1995 and the \nBGS use a 61-point cosine filter, having adopted this \nmethod in 1997 when instruments capable of one-\nsecond sampling were first installed in the UK. \nFinally, we should mention that minute means \nhave not always been centred on the minute, but \nrather were often computed from the 60 seconds of \nvalues prior to the minute. It wasn\u2019t until the IAGA \nmeeting in Canberra, Australia in 1979 that the \ndecision was taken to encourage observatories to \ncentre the minute values exactly on the minute \n(Resolution 12). \n7.2.2.2 Hourly, Daily, Monthly, Annual Means \nAn on-going debate within the geomagnetic \nobservatory community is the question of how HMVs \nshould be computed when data are missing within the \nhour. The question centres on the accuracy of HMVs \nwhen the one-minute data for the hour are not \ncomplete. Over recent years a number of researchers \nhave considered what may affect the accuracy of \nHMVs considering various factors including how \nmany data points are missing, the distribution of \nthese data gaps (random, continuous blocks), the \nlevel of magnetic activity and, the magnetic latitude \nof the observatory. Both Mandea (2002) and Schott \nand Linthe (2007) concluded that a reliable HMV \ncould be computed if less than 10 % of the data were \n10 \nmissing. However Herzog (2009) found that during \nmagnetically quiet times, including at a high-latitude \nstation, up to two-thirds of the data could be missing \nwithout significant loss of accuracy. Newitt (2009) \nalso found the 10% rule be an over-simplification \nleading both to the unnecessary rejection and \nunacceptable inclusion of certain data. He suggested \na more statistical approach based on a set maximum \npermissible error and this was further considered in \nMarsal and Curto (2009) who studied the effect of a \npre-established relative accuracy on HMVs. Love \n(2009) stated that the level of accuracy set for HMVs \ncould not be better than the <5nT level set for minute \ndata by INTERMAGNET. In his study, he found that \nHMVs could satisfy this 5nT level of accuracy, on \naverage, about 90% of the time if the \u201c10 % rule\u201d \nwere applied. Whilst no common consensus yet \nexists on this issue, an IAGA task force is currently \nworking towards determining a resolution (Hejda et \nal., 2009). \nQuestions have also arisen regarding how the \ndaily means should be computed. Differences can \narise depending upon whether one computes a daily \nmean from the average of the 1440 minutes of the \nday or from the average of the 24 hours of the day. \nMissing data during the day can give rise to these \ndifferences. INTERMAGNET guidance states that a \ndaily mean is calculated from 24 hourly values and \nan hourly value is calculated from 60 one-minute \nvalues. Monthly and annual means are less sensitive \nto these differences, although this depends on the \namount of missing data and the time distribution of \nthe missing data. These have historically been \ncomputed both for all days and for magnetically quiet \ndays using the daily mean values. At the WDC \nEdinburgh, a note is associated with any annual mean \nvalue derived from an incomplete data set. This \nallows these data to be down-weighted when used in \nglobal magnetic field modelling. \n7.2.2.3 Digital Magnetic Activity Indices \nAlthough production of digital one-minute data \nbecame the standard for observatory operations, the \nlegacy of products produced from the analogue \nmagnetograms, including magnetic indices, \ncontinued. The long time series of these products \nwere important to researchers studying the magnetic \nfield and development of \u201cmagnetic climatologies\u201d \nrequiring many decades of data.  \nThe derivation of K-indices from digital data \npresented its own unique difficulties. At first the data \nwere plotted and printed on paper thus enabling the \nindex to be hand-scaled in the same way as \ntraditionally done from photographic magnetograms. \nThere was, however, a strong incentive to obtain K-\nindices automatically using computer algorithms. A \ncomparison between the various proposed algorithms \nwas organised by an IAGA Working Group on \ngeomagnetic indices, and four computer-derived \nmethods were found to provide acceptable results \nwhen compared to the hand-scaled method. The four \nmethods, discussed in Menvielle et al. (1995), were \napproved at the IUGG General Assembly in Vienna \nin 1991. Although many institutes gradually switched \nto digital derivation, some have continued to use the \ntraditional hand-scaling method.  \nThe convenience and flexibility of digital \nelectronic media provided the opportunity to not only \nderive existing indices digitally, and in a more timely \nmanner, but also to devise new magnetic activity \nindices, such as the AE-index and PC-index.  \nThe AE-index is the auroral electrojet index that is \nderived from a set of 12 observatories located in the \nauroral zone latitudes of the northern hemisphere \n(Davis and Sugiura, 1966). Plots of the H-component \nfor each station are superimposed together to form a \ncollection of traces. This collection produces upper \nand lower bounds of the range of magnetic activity \nfor the group. The maximum positive deviation of the \nH-traces produces an upper bound (AU), and the \nmaximum negative deviation produces a lower bound \n(AL). AE is the difference between the two and \nprovides a global measure of the magnetic activity \ncaused by ionospheric currents within the auroral \noval. It correlates well with magnetospheric sub-\nstorms that can last for several hours. This index is \nattractive because it is easy to\u00a0compute digitally, and \ncan be used to provide a measure of magnetic activity \nover any time scale desired. It also has known \nlimitations; for example during very large storms the \nauroral electrojet will move equatorward of AE \nstations and its strength will no longer be measured \n(e.g., Akasofu, 1981; Feldstein et al., 1997). This \nindex was endorsed by IAGA in 1969 (Resolution 2). \nThe PC-index is the polar cap (dimensionless) \nindex designed to measure geomagnetic activity over \nthe polar cap regions using only a single station \nlocated near the geomagnetic North and South poles \n(Troshichev and Andrezen, 1985). These polar \nstations are Qaanaaq (previously Thule) in Greenland \nfor the northern hemisphere and Vostok in Antarctica \nfor the southern hemisphere. This index is used to \ndescribe the principal features of the solar wind and \nthe Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF), and \nindicates the total energy input into the \nmagnetosphere. This was recommended to IAGA in \nBirmingham (1999) and endorsed in Hanoi (2001). \nThe endorsement was later suspended due to different \nprocedures being used in the derivation of the index \nin each hemisphere (PCN and PCS). At Sopron, \nStauning et al. (2009) outlined a unified procedure \nnow in use for both indices.  \n11 \n7.2.2.4 One-Second Data \nWith advances in magnetometers and other hardware \nsystems and circuitry, it was inevitable that \nobservatories would begin collecting and storing one-\nsecond data. Currently data reported from \nobservatories are most commonly one-second values \nrecorded from a magnetometer sampling at 1 Hz. \nUnlike one-minute and hourly mean data these are \nspot values and the accuracy of the timing (to the \nmillisecond) is not well controlled. Providing true \none-second mean data (obtained by filtering higher \nfrequency data) is a challenging endeavour requiring \nsophisticated magnetometer specifications, timing \naccuracy, sampling restrictions, physical and \nnumerical filtering processes, data processing and \nstorage techniques. The greatest obstacle to overcome \nis instrumental noise which at 1Hz is typically 10 \npT\/\u221a(Hz), greater than geomagnetic signal at this \nfrequency. \nAt the IAGA conference in Sopron, several \nauthors reported on issues regarding developments \nregarding one-second data. Korepanov et al. (2009) \npresented the results of tests with a new \nmagnetometer, developed at the Lviv Center of \nInstitute for Space Research in the Ukraine, which \nmeets the standards for one-second data set by \nINTERMAGNET. Their magnetometer \naccomplished a 1 pT resolution matching the \nstandard proposed by INTERMAGNET. The \nsensitivity threshold is close to 1 pT, and the \ndamping of higher frequency ambient noise, \nespecially that of power line harmonics has been \nachieved. Dourbes and Conrad observatories are \ncurrently using this particular magnetometer. \nWorthington et al. (2009a) reported on an effort to \nestimate the noise levels and timing accuracy of the \nfluxgate magnetometers and A\/D converters for the \none-second data being collected at the USGS, \ncompared to the standards proposed by \nINTERMAGNET. The results showed that the USGS \nobservatories studied have noise levels of 0.01-0.02 \nnT and the timing is close to the 10 millisecond \naccuracy proposed by INTERMAGNET in 2008.  \nOthers observatories around the world are \ninvestigating this issue and developing new \ntechniques and instrumentation to provide one-\nsecond data (for example Chulliat et al., 2009a; \nShanahan and Turbitt, 2009; Worthington et al., \n2009b). Whilst this is a new development for most, \nthe Japan Meteorological Agency has been recording \none-second data at Kakioka observatory for about 25 \nyears and at Memambetsu and Kanoya observatories \nfor over 10 years (Minamoto, 2009).  \nA difficulty with one-second data is the question \nof what format to use for distribution. The IAGA-\n2002 format (see Appendix 1) allows for the \npossibility of one-second data, but only provides for a \nresolution of 0.01 nT or 10 pT, and this is insufficient \nfor the INTERMAGNET proposal to record one-\nsecond data to 1pT resolution. Nonetheless, it was \ndecided at the INTERMAGNET meeting in Sopron \n(2009), that one-second preliminary data would be \ndistributed from the website. IMOs will be requested \nto submit all one-second data that they hold. Initially \nthe IAGA-2002 data format is to be used for these \ndata, despite the resolution problem. Several \npossibilities for a more satisfactory format were \ndiscussed at the Sopron meeting, including: the \ndevelopment of a new format using XML; the \ndevelopment of a new format using the CDF \n(Common Data Format) [1] currently used in space \nphysics and magnetic satellites communities; or \nmodifying the current IAGA-2002 format.  \n7.2.2.5 Quasi-Definitive Data \nThe significant time delay between the availability of \npreliminary data and definitive data from \nobservatories prompted the proposal of a new data \ntype at the 11th IAGA Scientific Assembly in Sopron. \nPreliminary data are accessible almost immediately \nin many cases, but the definitive data can take a year \nor more to become available. Field modellers have a \nneed for what has been termed \u201cquasi-definitive \ndata,\u201d defined as \u201cdata corrected using temporary \nbaselines shortly after their acquisition and very near \nto being the final data of the observatory\u201d (Chulliat et \nal., 2009b). Such baseline corrected observatory data \nare useful to modellers to quickly detect geomagnetic \njerks (Chulliat et al., 2010), to test IGRF-11 \ncandidate models (Chulliat, 2009c; Finlay et al., \n2010) and for the validation of level-2 products \nwithin the context of the upcoming Swarm mission \n(Friis-Christensen et al., 2006), expected to be \nlaunched in 2012. The appeal of this data to \nmodellers is apparent, but one concern with this \nproposal is the notion of the values being \u201cvery near\u201d \nto that of the final definitive data. One standard \nproposed at the INTERMAGNET meeting following \nIAGA was that the data should be within 5 nT of the \nfinal definitive values, although verification will only \nbe possible following production of the definitive \ndata. Recent studies suggest observatories should be \nable to meet this requirement, but confirmation of the \naccuracy achieved will always be after the fact.  \nOne study presented in Sopron reported on work \ncarried out at the BGS and demonstrated that quasi-\ndefinitive data can be produced in near real-time \n(Baillie et al., 2009). BGS use piecewise polynomials \nto estimate baselines, and these are extrapolated to \nprovide the daily baseline values used to construct \nquasi-definitive data in near real-time. For the five \nBGS INTERMAGNET observatories, comparisons \nwere made between the X, Y and vertical (Z) \ncomponent quasi-definitive hourly mean values, \n12 \navailable on a next day basis, and the final definitive \nhourly mean values from 2000 to 2007. The \ndistribution of differences showed that for all \nobservatories the quasi-definitive data were within \n5nT of the final data 94 - 99% of the time. Peltier and \nChulliat (2010) also recently proposed a method for \nproducing quasi-definitive data every month and \ndemonstrated that the difference between quasi-\ndefinitive and definitive data was less than 1 nT, well \nwithin INTERMAGNET standard, for nine \nobservatories having very different baseline \ncharacteristics. At Sopron, IAGA encouraged \nmagnetic observatories to produce baseline-corrected \nquasi-definitive data shortly after their acquisition \n(Resolution 5) (IAGA, 2009). \n \n7.3 Data Availability \n7.3.1 World Data Centres for Geomagnetism \nDuring the IGY, the ICSU created a number of \nWDCs that were designed to collect, catalogue, \narchive and distribute geophysical and solar data sets \nfrom a few centralised locations (ICSU Panel on \nWDCs, 1996). There was, and continues to be, a clear \nneed for a few central repositories where scientists \ncan go to obtain data in a consistent format and avoid \ncatastrophic and irreversible losses of collected data \n(Mandea and Papitashvili, 2009). Originally, WDCs \nwere set up in the United States (WDC-A), Russia \n(WDC-B), Europe (WDC-C1) and Asia-Oceania \n(WDC-C2). This has expanded to other regions, \nnotably China (WDC-D) in 1988. WDCs were \noriginally established to manage and preserve data \nfrom the physical sciences, such as geomagnetism, \noceanography, and meteorology. Since these \nbeginnings WDCs have expanded greatly in both the \ndisciplines they support and the ways in which they \nmeet the scientific community\u2019s requirements. \nToday, WDCs are more broadly environmental and \ninclude such disciplines as biodiversity and ecology, \nsoils, and land processes. There are now more than \n50 WDCs located in 12 different countries, as shown \nin Fig 7.6. Geomagnetic observatory data, \ngeomagnetic indices, survey data, models and other \nsources are maintained at several of these WDCs. \nWDCs are funded and maintained by their host \ncountries on behalf of the international scientific \ncommunity. The WDCs operate under the guidelines \nof an ICSU panel, and from the outset have \nchampioned full and open access with data made \navailable free of change, or for the nominal costs of \nreproduction. WDCs are encouraged to exchange \ndata with each other and there are informal \narrangements between data centres holding \ngeomagnetic data to exchange new data sets received. \nWDCs are also expected to assure a reasonable \nstandard of data quality and documentation. The \nultimate responsibility however for data quality lies \nwith the data contributor and not the WDC (ICSU \nPanel on WDCs, 1996). Recently Korte et al. (2007)\n \nFig. 7.6 Locations and scope of the various World Data Centres worldwide. (Redrawn from original courtesy of Prof B. Minster, \npast Chair of the ICSU Panel on WDC)  \nidentified a number of inconstancies in the hourly \nmean data sets held at the (then) WDC for \nGeomagnetism in Copenhagen. It is preferable that \ndata producers re-examine their data sets and update \nthe WDC database accordingly. However in some \ncases WDCs have, and do, make changes to the data \nheld within. For example, Dawson et al. (2009) \nreported in Sopron on WDC for Geomagnetism, \nEdinburgh\u2019s efforts to correct simple typographical \nand formatting errors to the data sets. In this case it is \nnot necessary to return the data to the individual \nobservatory to correct. Improving the metadata \nassociated with data sets, noting any errors, and if \nchanges are made, is perhaps the first step to \nimproving the quality of the data held. \n7.3.1.1 World Data Centre for Geomagnetism, \nEdinburgh \nThe WDC for Geomagnetism, Edinburgh [2] was \nestablished in 1966 at the Institute of Geological \nSciences in Sussex, which later became the BGS, and \nmoved to its current location in Edinburgh in 1977. \nBGS, which is part of the Natural Environment \nResearch Council (NERC), a publicly-funded agency, \nhad concentrated on gathering data primarily for use \nin global magnetic field modelling - mainly annual \nmean data from the worldwide observatory network. \nWhereas, the WDC in Copenhagen, which was \nhosted by the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), \ngathered one-minute and hourly observatory data. \nWDC-Copenhagen provided access to these data sets \nonline via a \u2018Data Catalogue\u2019 website. In 2007, BGS \nagreed to take over responsibility for these data sets \nand the operation of this \u2018Data Catalogue\u2019 website. \nData now held at the WDC-Edinburgh include \ndigital data from geomagnetic observatories \nworldwide (Fig 7.7) including one-minute mean \nvalues from 1969; hourly values from 1883; and \nannual means from 1813. Also available are \nuncorrected one-second data from 2000 onwards \nfrom UK observatories and digital versions of some \nyearbooks. Data from land, marine and aeromagnetic \nsurveys and repeat stations worldwide from 1900 \nonwards are available, as well as charts and \ncomputations of main field models, including the \nWorld Magnetic Model (WMM) and International \nGeomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model. Further \ndigital data include definitive magnetic activity \nindices (K, Kp, ap, Ap, aa, Aa, Cp and C9); estimated \nreal-time planetary indices (apest, Apest, aaest and \nAaest) and solar activity indices (SSN and F10.7) [3]. \nIn addition its analogue data holdings include ship-\nborne declination data from 1590 onwards; archived \nmagnetograms for several UK stations from 1850; \nand a library containing yearbooks, expedition \nmemoirs, original survey observations and similar \nitems. Data are available online, by anonymous FTP \nor by request. \n7.3.1.2 World Data Center for Geomagnetism, \nKyoto  \nIn 1957, the Faculty of Science, Kyoto University \nwas assigned to establish the WDC-C2 for \nGeomagnetism [4] since it was well-known for its \nachievements in geomagnetic research. This led to \nthe foundation of the World Data Archive for \nGeomagnetism in the Kyoto University Library in \nDecember of the same year. In 1976, the Solar \nTerrestrial Physics Subcommittee of Science Council \nof Japan adopted the resolution that the existing data \narchive should be managed by a new research \ninstitution. As a result, on April 18, 1977, the Data \nAnalysis Center for Geomagnetism and Space \nMagnetism (DACGSM) was established as a new \ninstitution in the Faculty of Science, Kyoto \nUniversity and an associate professor was assigned to \nit. For over 30 years, DACGSM has been operating \nthe WDC for Geomagnetism, Kyoto and providing a \nleading data service. \nWDC Kyoto holds geomagnetic field data in form \nof normal-run magnetograms, rapid-run \nmagnetograms, hourly digital values, one-minute \ndigital values, and one-second digital values. Kyoto \nalso derives geomagnetic indices, including the AE-\nindex and the Dst-index, both of which are IAGA \nsanctioned indices, as well as the SYM\/ASY indices \n(Iyemori, 1990). Recent advances in computing have \nmade it possible for this data centre to collect and \ndisplay geomagnetic field data in real-time from \nmore than 30 observatories. Magnetograms have \nbeen copied onto microfilm or microfiche and are \navailable back to the early 1900\u2019s. Converted digital \nimages of old magnetograms resulting from the ICSU \n\u201cMagnetogram Rescue Project\u201d are also available \nfrom the Kyoto WDC [5].   \n7.3.1.3 World Data Center for Geomagnetism, \nCopenhagen \nThe WDC for Geomagnetism, Copenhagen is \nmaintained by the National Space Institute at the \nTechnical University of Denmark (DTU Space) [6] \nsince 2010. It was established at the DMI for the IGY \nin 1957. Its Geomagnetic Data Master Catalogue for \ngeomagnetic observatory hourly means and one-\nminute means moved to WDC Edinburgh in 2007. \nWDC-Copenhagen currently holds digital data for \nthe PCN-index derived from Qaanaaq geomagnetic \nobservatory, and a mirror of the GFZ Potsdam ftp-\nserver, home of the Kp-index. It has substantial \nanalogue holdings and catalogues of these holdings, \nin the form of searchable PDF files, are available \nonline [7]. This includes approximately 4300 years of \nmagnetograms from about 280 geomagnetic \n \n \nFig. 7.7 (a) Locations of geomagnetic observatories worldwide, with data held in the Edinburgh WDC.

The WDC-\nCopenhagen holdings also include data from 406 \nobservatories mainly from the IGY onwards, also \ndata from the Second Polar Year, 1932-1933. Most of \nthe data are stored on microfilm, microfiche, and in \nprinted publications. \n7.3.1.4 World Data Centre for Geomagnetism, \nMumbai \nThe Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG), Navi \nMumbai houses the WDC for Geomagnetism, \nMumbai [8]. The centre is situated on the campus of \nold Colaba Magnetic Observatory, Bombay, which \noperated from 1841 to 1905. India\u2019s participation in \nthe study of the earth\u2019s magnetism dates back to the \nperiod 1834-1841, when the country joined the \nGottingen Magnetic Union. Full-fledged functioning \nof the WDC for Geomagnetism started at the IIG in \n1991 under the recommendation of ICSU and the \nWDC Panel. \nThe centre holdings include magnetograms, \ngeomagnetic hourly values, yearbooks of various \nobservatories, digital data on magnetic tape, diskettes \nand CD-ROMs, microfilms and microfiche of the \nmagnetograms, solar geophysical data bulletins \ncontaining solar rotation numbers; Kp, Ap, Cp and \nZ\u00fcrich sunspot numbers, and indices such as Dst, AE, \nAU, AL, and aa. The centre is equipped with ample \nfacilities for data retrieval, and these data are \navailable in machine readable form upon written \nrequest or personal visit to the WDC.  \n7.3.1.5 World Data Center for Solar-\nTerrestrial Physics, Moscow \nThe WDC system in Russia consists of two facilities. \nThe WDC-B was one of the original data centres \nestablished in the USSR by the Academy of Sciences \nof the USSR in 1957 to support the IGY. In 1971, the \nWDC for Solid Earth Physics (WDC for SEP) in \nMoscow was established as a part of WDC-B, and is \nmaintained by the Geophysical Center of the Russian \nAcademy of Sciences (RAS). WDC for SEP has \nconcentrated on gathering data about the main \nmagnetic field and its secular variations. A \nconsiderable part of these data are stored as \npublications on paper and microfilm, but some are \nalso available in digital electronic form from their \nwebsite [9]. Data stored at the WDC for SEP, \nMoscow include digital annual means values from \n1813 onwards; publications of original land, marine \nand aeromagnetic survey observations; catalogues of \nmeasured values of the geomagnetic field elements, \nsecular variation data, and charts of the geomagnetic \nfield elements and its anomalies. \nThe other facility is the WDC for Solar-Terrestrial \nPhysics (STP), also in Moscow [10]. The WDC for \nSTP holds analogue data (mainly on microfilm and \nmicrofiche) from 1957 for the worldwide network of \n264 magnetic stations as normal-run magnetograms, \nrapid-run magnetograms, hourly-, minute- and daily-\nmean values, as well as global magnetic activity \nindices and various publications. All standard \ngeomagnetic data stored in the WDC for STP, \nMoscow, are accessible on the Moscow SPIDR \n(Space Physics Interactive Data Resource) website \nand mirrored worldwide (see section 7.3.5.1). \nAdditional data in non-standard formats are \navailable on the website of the WDC for STP. Digital \nelectronic data from the WDC for STP website \ninclude data from magnetic observatories in Russia \nand the Former Soviet Union; hourly-mean values for \n38 observatories mainly from the IGY onwards; one-\nminute values from 41 observatories mainly from \n1983 onwards; global magnetic activity indices (aa, \nKp, Ap, AE, Dst, Pc); digital images of \nmagnetograms beginning from 1957; ssc from 1868 \nonwards; and a catalogue of geomagnetic Pc1 \npulsations at the Borok and Mirny observatories from \n1957-1992. Participation in the ICSU \u201cRescue of \nMagnetograms Project\u201d resulted in digital images of \nmagnetograms from nine observatories covering over \n100 observatory-years worth of data. \n7.3.1.6 World Data Center for Solar-\nTerrestrial Physics, Boulder \nWDC-A was one of the original data centres \nestablished in the United States by the Coast & \nGeodetic Survey (C&GS) in 1957 to support \nmanagement of the full suite of IGY data. The \nNational Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) was \ncreated in 1965 to assume responsibility for long-\nterm management of the geophysical data, including \nthe WDCs for Geomagnetism, Gravity, and \nSeismology.  NGDC moved to Boulder, CO from \nWashington, DC in 1972, assuming responsibility for \nthe WDC-A for Solar Activity hosted by the \nUniversity of Colorado. Currently, NGDC operates \ntwo WDCs; the WDC for Solar-Terrestrial Physics \n(WDC-STP) [11] and the WDC for Geophysics and \nMarine Geology (WDC-GMG) [12]. \nThe WDC-STP holds data sets relating to solar \nactivity, the space environment, ionosphere, \nthermosphere, geomagnetism, and cosmic rays. \nGeomagnetic observations at magnetic observatories \nare maintained as one-minute, hourly, daily, monthly, \nand annual mean values. In addition to the \n16 \nobservatory data, the WDC-STP also manages \nmagnetic variation, repeat observation, and land \nsurvey data, satellite data and global indices of \nmagnetic activity. The WDC-GMG manages \nmagnetic data collected at sea, aeromagnetic data, \nand develops and distributes magnetic field models, \nincluding the joint US\/UK WMM and IAGA IGRF.  \nThe marine and airborne magnetic data are available \nthrough the GEODAS (Geophysical Data System) \nonline system at [13]. Digital data are available \nonline through their websites or by FTP. The WDC-\nSTP also supports the SPIDR data portal that allows \ninternet users to access, browse, display, and analyse \nSTP data. \n7.3.1.7 World Data Centre for Solar-\nTerrestrial Science, Sydney  \nThe WDC for Solar-Terrestrial Science [14] is \noperated by IPS (Ionospheric Prediction Service) \nRadio and Space Services, a program within the \nBureau of Meteorology of the Australian \nGovernment. The centre was established in 2000 and \noperates in Sydney, Australia. It contains \nionospheric, magnetometer, spectrograph, cosmic ray \ndata and solar images that are available for download \nvia FTP. Currently WDC-Sydney holds \nmagnetometer data for ten locations in Australia and \ntwo in Pakistan. \n7.3.1.8 World Data Center for Geophysics, \nBeijing \nThe WDC for Geophysics [15] is operated by the \nInstitute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese \nAcademy of Sciences. It was established in 1988 and \nis based in Beijing, China. With the support of the \ninstitute, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Ministry \nof Science and Technology, they have established \nonline access to scientific data, such as geomagnetic \ndata, gravity data, geoelectric field data and seismic \nwave data. This WDC holds one-minute and K-index \ndata for Beijing Ming Tombs (BMT) observatory. \nMuch effort has also been made to rescue historical \nmagnetograms from 1877-1962 from Sheshan \nmagnetic observatory. This collection has now been \nmicrofilmed and some magnetograms have been \nscanned and made available from their website \n(Peng, 2007). \n7.3.2 INTERMAGNET \nINTERMAGNET stands for International Real-time \nMagnetic Observatory Network. Its objective, to \nestablish a \u201cglobal network of cooperating digital \nmagnetic observatories, adopting modern standard \nspecifications for measuring and recording \nequipment, in order to facilitate data exchange and \nthe production of geomagnetic data products in close \nto real-time\u201d (St-Louis et al. 2008) was achieved and \nfurther improvements continue to be the goal. The \norigin of the organisation and current operation are \ndescribed in detail by Kerridge (2001) and Rasson \n(2007). Since its inception in 1986 INTERMAGNET \nhas become the de facto organisation for setting \nstandards for the highest quality observatory \noperations. Data types are defined as Reported (the \nraw data without any corrections), Adjusted (data that \nhave some modifications made to it), and Definitive \n(the final published data), and these codes are used in \nthe headers of the adopted data exchange formats. \nInstrument standards, such as accuracy and resolution \nwere also established. Observatories that meet these \nstandards and requirements are known as \nINTERMAGNET Magnetic Observatories, or IMOs.  \nIn 1991, the USGS proposed that \nINTERMAGNET produce a CD-ROM of definitive \none-minute data from IMOs, based upon a model the \nUSGS had published (Herzog and Lupica 1992). \nSince then, INTERMAGNET has produced CD-\nROMs, and now DVD-ROMs, annually. For 2007, \nthe DVD-ROM contains data for 104 observatories \nfrom 41 countries. In 1997 a website was created [16] \nand this is now an important portal for the availability \nof both definitive and preliminary worldwide \nobservatory data. \n Following the 11th IAGA Scientific Assembly in \nSopron, INTERMAGNET management resolved to \nmake both one-second and quasi-definitive data \navailable from all IMOs that are able to provide it (S \nFlower, personal communication, 2009). It was \ndecided to restore all archived preliminary data to the \nwebsite. The ability to provide commercial protection \nof data by time-limited distribution from the website \nwill be introduced. The \u2018gold standard\u2019 for near real-\ntime data delivery was agreed to be at 2-3 minutes \ndelay and a discussion session was held to try to \nidentify techniques that might be used to implement \nthis standard.  \n7.3.3 World Data System \nIn 2006 ISCU established an ad-hoc Strategic \nCommittee on Information and Data (SCID) to advise \nISCU on the future organisation and direction of its \nactivities in relation to scientific data and \ninformation. The SCID considered input from three \nICSU Interdisciplinary Bodies: the WDC, the \nFederation of Astronomical and Geophysical Data \nanalysis Services (FAGS) and the Committee on Data \nfor Science and Technology (CODATA).  \nDespite the success of the WDCs, the review \nhighlighted some basic problems that needed to be \naddressed. There was no real \u201csystem\u201d in the sense of \na managed or coordinated effort between the WDCs. \nWhile the ICSU WDC panel provided guidance, the \nWDCs have, for the most part, operated as individual \ninstitutions rather than a single entity, and the \n17 \nconcept of data interoperability was only minimally \nimplemented. There are also large disparities between \nWDCs in the developed countries and those in \ndeveloping countries, no central comprehensive \ndirectory or catalogue of data available at the WDCs \nand an increasingly urgent problem with old data \nholdings being at risk of decay, lost, or discarded \n(ICSU 2008).   \nIn its review the SCID also considered the \noperation of the FAGS and CODATA. The FAGS \n[17] was formed by ISCU in 1956 as part of IGY. \nTheir principal purpose has been to encourage the \nanalysis of long-term data sets and produce data \nproducts for the scientific community. The review by \nSCID identified similar issues to the WDCs with the \nservices being very much a product of history rather \nthan by design. CODATA were established by ICSU \nin 1966. It provides a cross-disciplinary focus on \nscientific data and aims to improve the quality and \naccessibility of scientific data and the methods by \nwhich those data are acquired, managed, and \nanalysed. \nFollowing the review by the SCID, at the 2008 \nICSU General Assembly, it was agreed to abolish the \nICSU Panel on WDCs and create a World Data \nSystem (WDS) incorporating former WDCs with the \nFAGS, and other centres and services [18]. Those \nWDCs and FAGS currently in existence must now \napply to ICSU to re-establish membership as a part of \nthe WDS. The WDS will provide a coordinated and \nstrategic response to the data needs of the global \nscientific community with international initiatives \nsuch as the International Polar Year (IPY). \nThe WDS will transition from a set of stand-alone \nWDCs, and individual Services, to a common \nglobally interoperable distributed data system, while \nincorporating new scientific data activities. The new \nsystem will have advanced interconnections between \ndata management components for disciplinary and \nmultidisciplinary scientific data applications. WDS \nwill have a broader disciplinary and geographic base \nthan the previous ICSU bodies and will strive to \nbecome a worldwide \u2018community of excellence\u2019 for \nscientific data. Eventually the WDS plan is to \nimplement a Global Data System of Systems (GDSS) \nthat should be interoperable with current and \nemerging data systems such as Global Earth \nObservations System of Systems (GEOSS) [19] \n(Minster et al., 2009).  \n7.3.4 The International Service of \nGeomagnetic Indices \nThe International Service of Geomagnetic Indices \n(ISGI) is a collaborative international service \nestablished by IAGA and falling within the FAGS. \nISGI collects, derives, validates, maintains and \ndistributes time-series of geomagnetic indices and \nother geomagnetic data products. The service is also \nresponsible for the publication and distribution of any \nIAGA Bulletins containing information on \ngeomagnetic indices.  \nThe main ISGI operations are carried out at the \nLaboratoire Atmosph\u00e8res, Milieux, Observations \nSpatiales (LATMOS), Paris (official derivation of aa, \nam, Km). The other ISGI collaborating institutes are: \nGeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ), Potsdam (official \nderivation of Kp, Ap and international quiet and \ndisturbed days); Observatorio del Ebro, Roquetes \n(official derivation of ssc and solar flare effects \n(sfe)); and WDC-C2 for Geomagnetism, Kyoto \n(official derivation of Dst and AE). Data availability \nfor the latter is described in more detail in section \n7.3.1.2 and further information on the other institutes \nfollows. \n7.3.4.1 LATMOS, France \nEstablished in 2009 following a reorganisation of \nscientific organisations in France, LATMOS has now \nreplaced Centre d'\u00e9tude des Environnements \nTerrestre et Plan\u00e9taires (CETP) as the main ISGI \nhost. As well as having the primary responsibility for \nthe derivation of the aa, am and Km indices, \nLATMOS also maintains the ISGI database of the \nIAGA endorsed indices and operates the ISGI \npublication office and the main ISGI website [20]. As \nwell as providing online access to the ISGI data, the \nwebsite contains valuable information (metadata) on \nthe derivation and meaning of the indices. The \ndefinitive indices available online are: aa, Kpa (from \n1868); am, Kpm (from 1959); Dst (from 1957); AU, \nAE and AL (from 1957); ssc (from 1868); \ninternational quietest days (from 1932); and Kp (from \n1932). Monthly bulletins are also produced, which \ncontain various provisional indices and include \ngraphs of musical diagrams of Km and aa. These are \ncirculated by post as well as being made available on \nthe website. \n7.3.4.2 GeoForschungsZentrum, Germany \nHelmholtz-Center Potsdam, the German Research \nCenter for Geosciences or GFZ is the national \nGerman research centre for the Earth sciences. The \nAdolf-Schmidt-Observatory Niemegk, belonging to \nGFZ, derives and maintains the Kp, ap and Ap \nindices as well as the lesser known planetary indices, \nCp and C9.  Definitive indices are produced twice a \nmonth and quick look versions are provided in near-\nreal time. As well as the planetary indices, GFZ\u2019s \nISGI responsibilities include the selection of the \ninternational quietest days (Q-days) and most \ndisturbed days (D-days) of each month, which are \nclassified using the Kp indices. These, the \naforementioned planetary indices and ssc data \nprovided by Observatorio del Ebro are all available \n18 \non the GFZ website [21] in various formats, \nincluding ASCII tables, histograms and Bartels music \ndiagrams. They are also available to download \ndirectly from the GFZ anonymous FTP site.  \n7.3.4.3 Observatorio del Ebro, Spain  \nThe Ebro Observatory is a research institute founded \nby the Society of Jesus in 1904 to study the Sun-\nEarth relationships. It is a non-profit organisation \nassociated with the Spanish Research Council \n(CSIC). Since 1975, Ebro Observatory was entrusted \nby IAGA to host the International Service on Rapid \nMagnetic Variations. It has responsibility for \ncollecting, creating and publishing the official IAGA \nlists of rapid variations, which consist of ssc and sfe \nrecords. Annual lists of ssc data are available online \nfrom 1868 and sfe data from 1995 [22]. Monthly \nupdates are provided to LATMOS and GFZ for \nfurther distribution. \n7.3.5 Other Data Resources \n7.3.5.1 Space Physics Interactive Data \nResource \nThe SPIDR [23] is a data portal designed to allow a \nsolar terrestrial physics customer to intelligently \naccess and manage historical space physics data for \nintegration with environment models and space \nweather forecasts. SPIDR is a distributed network of \nsynchronous databases, web-portals and web-\nservices. There are SPIDR sites in Boulder, Paris, \nNagoya, Sydney, Beijing, Kiev, and Cape Town. \nSPIDR databases include geomagnetic one-minute, \nhourly means and annual means, as well as global \ngeomagnetic and solar indices. \n7.3.5.2 Observatory Operator\u2019s Websites \nMany institutions operating magnetic observatories in \nthe modern era have their own websites. This is an \nadditional resource providing access to geomagnetic \nobservatory data and data products to the user \ncommunity. Since the advent of digital data \ndistribution in the 1990\u2019s, observatories might not \nnecessarily submit their data to a WDC as \nrecommended by IAGA. It is recognised (Mandea \nand Papitashvili, 2009) that the traditional \u201cpush \ndata\u201d approach (to a WDC for example) is gradually \nbeing replaced by a \u201cpull data\u201d approach via data \nmining techniques such as virtual observatories (VO). \n7.3.5.3 Variometer Networks \nIn addition to the data resources mentioned thus far, \nwhere full-field definitive observatory data and \nactivity indices can be obtained, there are also a large \nnumber of variometer stations located around the \nglobe providing additional data resources. Unlike \nmagnetic observatories, variometer stations record \nonly the short-term variations in the magnetic field \nand not the absolute level. These instruments \ncomplement the network of magnetic observatories \nand these measurements are used especially in the \nstudy of solar-terrestrial science. \nThere is a large amount of data (past and present) \nfrom many different magnetometer chains or \nnetworks around the world. A worldwide \ncollaborative effort to pull these together was \ninitiated and a single source of ground based \nmagnetometer data is now available at SuperMAG \n[24]. This data portal website provides access to \nvariometer data from more than 200 stations \nworldwide. Data are available from 1997 and can be \nviewed and downloaded online as linear plots and \nmaps.  \nSuperMAG relies on acquiring data from a variety \nof sources including magnetometer networks such as \nIMAGE [25] (International Monitor for Auroral \nGeomagnetic Effects) and CARISMA [26] (Canadian \nArray for Realtime Investigations of Magnetic \nActivity). IMAGE is a network of 31 magnetometer \nstations operated by 10 institutions from Estonia, \nFinland, Germany, Norway, Poland, Russia and \nSweden. CARISMA operate an array of 25 stations \nthroughout Canada. INTERMAGNET also \ncontributes data to SuperMAG since magnetic \nobservatories can double as variometer stations. \nThere are dozens of similar magnetometer networks \nlocated across the globe and are too numerous to \nmention here. Most of these are collaborative \nventures in their own right, relying in turn on the \nindividual institutes operating the stations. \n \n7.4 Metadata and Metadata \nStandards \nMetadata are an increasingly important aspect of \ngeomagnetic data provision, both for the WDCs and \nfor other data providers. Metadata are information \nabout data; they are the \"who, what, when, where, \nwhy and how\" of a data set. They describe the \ncontent, quality, originator, and other characteristics \nof a data set that help users understand the nature of \nthat data set and how to use it. As time passes, and \npersonnel, instrumentation, and data processing \nprocedures change, it is important that current and \nfuture generations have sufficient information about \nthe data to enable them to independently understand \nand use them. The objective is to provide \ndocumentation that ensures that the values contained \nin a data set have the necessary reference \ninformation, and that even non-experts in a discipline \nwill be able to use the data properly.  \nAs Buneman (2005) notes, the web has radically \nchanged the way scientific research is carried out, \nwith more rapid and varied access to data, but this \n19 \nhas produced new issues in maintaining the scientific \nrecord. As data can readily be copied and altered we \nneed some means of verifying authorship and data \nprovenance for researchers. For data producers too \nthe issue of data citation is a growing concern. \nWayne (2005a; 2005b) demonstrates the many \nbenefits of metadata but also some of the obstacles to \nits production. Adhering to a metadata standard can \nbe complex and time-consuming and there may be \nlittle immediate, tangible benefit to data producers. \nHowever the potential benefit is great. \nThe subject of metadata was raised at the IAGA \nconference in Sopron, and at the INTERMAGNET \nmeeting that followed. Reay et al. (2009) highlighted \nthe need for good data provenance to assist scientific \nexamination of geomagnetic data sets. Better \nmetadata would lead to improvements in the curation \nof data at the WDCs; addressing any inconsistencies \nseen in data sets and providing a clear \u2018paper-trail\u2019 of \nany transformations or corrections to data. It would \nalso provide clear quality assurance to researchers, \nassisting data selection for global field models. In \naddition; common, well developed metadata \nimproves the \u201cdiscoverability\u201d of data through the \nmany metadata clearinghouses. \nSvalgaard and Cliver (2007) discuss the current \nissues of data quality within WDCs and note that \nmetadata about, especially, historical data is sorely \nlacking. They also point out the current difficulties in \nfeeding back any corrections into the WDCs. If \ncomprehensive metadata records were associated \nwith a dataset a researcher could trace all the data \nprocessing steps applied to a data set, more easily \nidentifying any inconsistencies. This would also \nprovide a means for archivists to document any \nsubsequent corrections made.  \nConsider another scenario: say, if you wanted to \ngather all geomagnetic data recorded by a fluxgate \nmagnetometer, spanning 1990-2000, located within \nN30-50 latitude range. Currently this would require a \nsignificant amount of investigation to determine \nwhich observatories this applied to and where to get \nthis data. If this simple metadata was recorded and \nstored in a central database in a known metadata \nstandard this type of query would take seconds. \nAt the Sopron assembly, IAGA recognised the \nimportance of metadata preservation in supporting \ngeophysical studies (Resolution 7) and encouraged \nrelevant agencies to support the generation, \npreservation and dissemination of metadata to ensure \nthe future usability of these data for interdisciplinary \nstudies. A session on metadata has been proposed for \nthe next IUGG General Assembly in 2011.  \nINTERMAGNET has assigned a representative to \nwork with groups in Japan, the UK, the US, and \nelsewhere on the issue of station-level metadata \nrequirements and proposals. INTERMAGNET will \nnotify the IMOs that a proposed standard would be \nforthcoming, and they should prepare to incorporate a \nnew element into the observatory operations. It was \nalso suggested that observatories place more effort on \ngenerating yearbooks with the omission of \nmagnetogram plots if that would facilitate their \nproduction. The WDCs are also considering this issue \nand a wiki has been established to further coordinate \ndiscussions on this matter. \nThere are many issues to be considered in the \ndevelopment of a metadata standard for magnetic \nobservatories. In the following sections we discuss \nsome of the types of metadata currently available, or \nin development, that might provide a solution to \ncapturing this important information resource.  \n7.4.1 Magnetic Observatory Metadata \n7.4.1.1 Yearbooks \nYearbooks provided the earliest form of metadata for \ngeomagnetic observatories, and are still being \nproduced by many institutions today. These contain a \npermanent record of the status of the observatory for \na given year and generally contain information about \nthe station location, instrumentation, contact persons \nand record significant events or changes to the \nobservatory throughout the year. These are published \nalongside the actual data products reported from an \nobservatory. \nTraditionally these were produced as printed \nbooks and these are stored in libraries, institutes and \nWDCs across the globe. Nowadays yearbooks are \noften produced in electronic PDF format that can be \nfound from the websites of some institutions, WDCs, \nand INTERMAGNET [27]. Additionally some \nefforts are being made to scan historical yearbooks \nallowing electronic access to these important records. \nWhilst the metadata held in yearbooks are often \nprecisely what we wish to capture in a metadata \nstandard, the format that this information is held is \nnot currently standardised and is not suitable for data \ndiscovery applications. Principally, observatory \noperators should be encouraged to record this \nmetadata, in whatever form, and then those within the \ngeomagnetism community engaged in data curation \nmust consider how to transfer this into an established \nmetadata format. Improvements in data mining may \nbe a way forward in this respect. \n7.4.1.2 INTERMAGNET \nThe best source for digital observatory metadata, at \nleast for those observatories within the organisation, \nis INTERMAGNET. Each year INTERMAGNET \npublish annual definitive observatory results on a \nCD\/DVD-ROM. Alongside the data a Readme file is \nsupplied for each observatory detailing basic \ninformation on location, instrumentation, sampling, \nfiltering, contacts etc. This ASCII text file is in a \n20 \nstandardised format with mandatory and optional \nfields. As these metadata records are directly related \nto a single published dataset they also provide \ntemporal metadata that is challenging to capture \notherwise. \nBeyond this published metadata there is much \nimplicit metadata associated with classifying an \nobservatory as an IMO. If an observatory meets \nINTERMAGNET standards you can infer much \ninformation about its data processing, quality \nassurance, data distribution and instrumentation \nstandards. However to a non-expert most of this \ninformation is not readily apparent: to access this \ntype of metadata you would need to refer to the \nTechnical Reference manual (St-Louis et al. 2008) \nheld separate to the data. \n7.4.1.3 Metadata Standards \nDespite the wealth of metadata, in yearbooks and \nfrom INTERMAGNET, there is currently no \nmetadata standard that can adequately describe data \nfrom magnetic observatories. With metadata, \nstandardisation is important because it provides a \ncommon set of formats, terminology and definitions \nthat facilitates the use and exchange of metadata \ndigitally. It provides uniformity and consistency over \ntime, enabling the development of tools and \nresources for metadata exchange and manipulation. \nOne might say that metadata standards are to \nmetadata what data formats are to data. \nConsidering what form a metadata standard for \nmagnetic observatory data may take, we can suggest \nsome of the basic information that would be required. \nThese include, but are not limited to: \n\uf0b7 Contact Information - The name of the responsible \ninstitute that produces the data, including \naddresses and personal contacts. \n\uf0b7 Data Description - A description of the type of \ndata, including a narrative summary of the nature \nof the data and its possible applications and a list \nof entities and attributes relevant to the data. \n\uf0b7 Station Description - A description of the station \nin question, including coordinates, elevation, and \npossibly photographs and maps. \n\uf0b7 Instrumentation - A description of the types of \ninstruments in use at the observatory, and the \nnature of the data that are retrieved from them. \n\uf0b7 Data Processing - A description of the processes \nand methodology used to process the data from \ninstrument recordings to the final definitive \nvalues. This should include a description of data \nformats and how the numerical values are to be \ninterpreted. \n\uf0b7 Data Quality - A general assessment of the quality \nof the data set considering completeness, \naccuracy, quality control methods and so on. \n\uf0b7 Data Distribution - A description of how and from \nwhere the data may be acquired, particularly \nthrough the WDCs. \n \nTo help us towards a metadata standard for \ngeomagnetic observatory data we must look toward \nthose standards currently in use for other, similar, \ndatasets. Metadata standards established for \ngeospatial data may act as such a guide. While these \nstandards address many of the basic requirements of \nour metadata (for data discoverability, distribution, \netc.) they lack the scope to deal with parameters that \nchange with time. For an observatory nothing is fixed \nfor all time: instrumentation, processing techniques, \nresponsible institutions, staff contacts, data types, \ndata quality, and even the observatory location can \nchange. How to address this issue is one the greatest \nchallenges facing metadata standardisation. \n7.4.2 FGDC Standard \nOne of the first standards produced for geospatial \ndata was developed by the Federal Geographic Data \nCommittee (FGDC) in the US [28], which was \ndesigned primarily as the template for storing and \ndistributing geographic spatial metadata. The FGDC \nstandard consists of 7 information sections: \n1. Identification - Basic information about the data \nset and originator. \n2. Data Quality - General assessment of the quality \nof the data set. \n3. Spatial Data Organisation - Used to represent \ndata set spatial information. \n4. Spatial Reference - Reference frame for data set \ncoordinates. \n5. Entity and Attribute - Details about the \ninformation content. \n6. Distribution - Distributor information and how to \nobtain the data set. \n7. Metadata Reference - Metadata responsible parties \nand current status. \nThis standard is complex, requiring the data \nprovider to fill in many metadata fields to comply. \nThese are often in a terminology that is unclear to \nnon-experts in the standard. The FGCD standard was \ndeveloped primarily for data products that have a \nsingle publication date, such as maps, and \nconsequently has limitations with regard to \nparameters that change in time - an important factor \nfor observatory metadata. One would have to write a \nseparate record for each change that occurs. \nThe NGDC has produced a modified standard for \nobservatory data based on FGDC standard, omitting \nsections that are not applicable to magnetic \nobservatories (Fischman et al., 2009). Within SPIDR, \nauthorised institute personnel can now enter metadata \nfor their own observatories using this modified \n21 \nFGDC template. SPIDR provides online forms \ncorresponding to the various sections of the modified \nFGDC standard, from which observatory-level \nmetadata records in the form of XML files are \ngenerated. While this goes some way to capture the \nrequired metadata it is still overly complex for \nobservatory data providers to complete, does not \nsolve the problem of tracking observatory histories, \nand has not been well received by the geomagnetic \ncommunity as yet. \n7.4.3 ISO-19115 Standard \nIn 2003 the International Standards Organisation \n(ISO) Technical Committee 211 on Geographic \nInformation\/Geomatics (ISO\/TC 211) released the \nmetadata standard ISO-19115. This combined \nvarious elements of national geospatial metadata \nstandard including the FGDC (USA), CEN\/TC287 \n(Netherlands), and ANZLIC (Australia & New \nZealand), as well as contributions from other \nmembers of the Open Geospatial Consortium [29].  \nThe FGDC mandatory fields and ISO core \nmetadata fields are quite similar, although ISO-19115 \noffers the possibility of more detail, and includes \nspecial coverage of raster and imagery information. \nWhile the FGDC standard has 7 informational \nsections, ISO-19115 has 14 comprising more than \n400 individual metadata elements. As with the FGDC \nstandard, most of these are optional and only a few of \nthe available elements are likely to be used. While \nthis ISO-19115 standard offers greater complexity \nand detail, it has the same issues as the FGDC \nstandard with no capacity to track time-changing \nparameters at observatories.  \n7.4.4 SPASE Data Model \nIn 2006 NASA funded five new VOs to cater for \ndifferent aspects of solar system science. A VO is a \ncomplex distributed environment with a goal to \nprovide a single point of discovery of data and related \nresources (Merka et al., 2008). Groups, including the \nSpace Physics Archive Search and Extract (SPASE) \nconsortium [30], are defining metadata standards to \naid in archiving and sharing of information resources \nfrom VOs. \nThe SPASE data model provides enough detail to \nallow a scientist to understand the content of the \nsolar-terrestrial data products together with essential \nretrieval and contact information (King et al., 2010). \nThe SPASE metadata schema divides the solar-\nterrestrial environment into a limited set of 12 \nresource types. Most commonly used are Display \nData, Numerical Data, Granule, Instrument, \nObservatory and Person. These resources are \ninterconnected to create a network of resources and \nthe relationship between these resources fully \ndescribes a dataset. VOs can harvest these resource \ndescriptions and allow users to find data. \nAs the SPASE data model manages the \ninterrelationship between resources, such as \nobservatory and instrument, it may prove to be better \nplaced to manage the issue of time-varying \ninformation in magnetic observatory data. \n7.4.5 XML  \nXML stands for eXtensible Markup Language and \nwas designed to store and transmit structured data in \nplain text. It allows users to define their own \nvocabulary using tags to mark-up data in a similar in \nway to how HTML is used to mark-up web pages. \nXML has become the de facto standard for the \nexchange of information, in part, because of this \nflexibility. A user can develop any set of properties to \ndefine the elements of a data set and describe that \ndata set using corresponding tags. This is known as \ncreating an XML schema. Data and metadata can be \nstored in a document conforming to that XML \nschema, and be exchanged and read by both \ncomputers and humans. \nFor example, consider an XML document used to \nrepresent an instance of an instrument type in \noperation at a magnetic observatory: \n \n \n<instrumentTypeUsageInstance> \n<beginDate>1975-05-09<\/beginDate> \n<vectorMagnetomterType>EDA Fluxgate magnetometer<\/vectorMagnetomterType> \n<endDate>1981-12-31<\/endDate> \n<\/instrumentTypeUsageInstance> \n \nThe angle brackets surround a tag name, with the \nbackslash used to indicate the end of an XML \nelement. In this example \ninstrumentTypeUsageInstance is an element that \nidentifies a period of time when a particular type of \ninstrument was in use. The vectorMagnetometerType \nelement describes the type of instrument in use and \nthe time-specific elements beginDate and endDate \ndefine the boundaries of the period when this \ninstrument was in use. Note also that XML elements \nmay be nested to reflect the structure of the data. \nBy constructing an XML schema that fully \nencapsulates magnetic observatory metadata we \nbegin to define a type of metadata standard. This \nstandard would be able to describe time-varying \naspects of an observatory\u2019s operation by defining \nappropriate elements, which is an advantage over \nusing current established standards. By using XML \n22 \nas a base, we can define the metadata and the method \nof storage and exchange at the same time. \nXML is primarily used to exchange information \nbetween computers. XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet \nLanguage: Transformations) is a tool that allows \nXML to be transformed into various formats such as \nplain text, HTML or into XML of a different schema \nwhich may be more appropriate for the end-user [31]. \nFor example the SPIDR system stores metadata in \nXML files and uses XSLT to transform this \ninformation into HTML for display to the user.   \n7.4.6 Databases \nAnother possibility being pursued at the NGDC, and \nreported on in Sopron, is the construction of a \ndatabase schema to store the relevant observatory \nparameters with time histories of these parameters as \nfields in the database tables (Mabie et al., 2009). For \nexample, changes in instrumentation from one time \nperiod to another (start time\/stop time) can be stored \nin the database tables, and retrieved when a user \nrequests metadata on that instrumentation within a \ngiven time-frame. The advantage of this approach is \nthat web pages can be developed that provide \nselectable metadata categories (e.g. contact \ninformation, changes to instrumentation, etc.) to \naccompany data sets requested by users. If a user \nrequests data from a certain observatory for a given \ninterval, it can be designed so that the user may also \nrequest the metadata on instrumentation, institution \naddress, data quality, or any other metadata category \ndeemed of interest to the user. A menu of choices \ncould be designed so that the user could select the \nkind of metadata of importance to them. The user \nwould not have to search for the metadata separately, \nbut could download it as an accompanying file with \nthe data itself. \nWhilst the XML and database approach may allow \nfor the complete capture of observatory metadata this \nis still one step away from an established \ninternational metadata standard. Translation \nalgorithms will be required to convert metadata held \nin a local form or within a magnetic observatory \ndatabase\/XML schema into an accepted standard \nwhen one is established.  \n \n7.5 Metadata Distribution \nOnce a metadata standard has been established there \nare many other issues to be addressed. We must \nconsider how this metadata is stored and managed \nand where it can be accessed from. Should multiple \nsites distribute the metadata, and how would we \nhandle consistency between sites? How would we \ncollect and ingest metadata records? Although \nobservatory operators will have the required \ninformation it may require a third-party to translate \nthis information into the established metadata \nstandard.  \nBeyond establishing a metadata standard these and \nmany other issues must be addressed in time. For \nnow, we will look at some selected examples of how \nmetadata records for various geophysical data are \ndistributed. All these metadata portals require a \nmanual process to obtain the metadata separate from \nacquiring the data itself. They all lack the desirable \nfeature of obtaining metadata simultaneously with \ndata.  \n7.5.1 SPIDR VO (USA) \nThe SPIDR is a distributed network of synchronised \nweb-accessible databases, developed by the NGDC, \nwhich provides users with access to current and \nhistorical STP data and metadata. SPIDR allows \nusers to login as a guest or register with a username \nand password. After selecting the geomagnetic view \noption, the user can then select view\/modify stations \nmetadata. After selecting an observatory the user is \npresented with the modified FGDC metadata record \nfor that observatory.  \nEach institution can assign a person responsible \nfor maintaining and updating the metadata associated \nwith the data from their own observatories. That \nperson registers with SPIDR, requesting permission \nto access and edit the metadata records for those \nobservatories.  \nAs this system is based on the modified FGDC \nstandard it has the same drawbacks regarding \nobservatory metadata as discussed in section 7.4.2. \n7.5.2 GeoMIND (Europe) \nGeoMIND (Geophysical Multilingual Internet-Driven \nInformation Center) [32] is an internet site dedicated \nto information about geophysical systems in Europe. \nIt is a consortium of 12 organisations from 9 different \ncountries, and provides metadata on geophysical data \nholdings from these countries in a consistent and \nseamless way, in whatever language the user selects. \nThe website allows a user to identify a data set and its \ngeneral content, and then be informed about how to \nobtain the data itself. This system allows for \nsearching and editing of metadata records, as well as \nthe importing and exporting of records in a variety of \nformats. \nWhilst geomagnetic monitoring is included as a \ngeophysical record within GeoMIND it is not \ncurrently well populated with metadata. The metadata \nare available on the web in the form of XML files \nconforming to ISO-19115. Only basic contact, \ncitation and data distribution metadata are currently \ncovered. \n23 \n7.5.3 GEOMET (Australia) \nGEOMET is the name of a database developed by \nAustralian Geosciences that holds metadata records \nin the ANZLIC standard. ANZLIC (Australia New \nZealand Land Information Council) is the metadata \nstandard adopted by Australia and New Zealand that \nprovides a schema required for describing geographic \ninformation, products, and services. It is similar to \nthe FGDC standard in the parameters it defines, \ngiving information about the identification, \ngeographical boundaries, the quality, the spatial and \ntemporal limits, spatial reference, and distribution of \ndigital geographic data. ANZLIC assigns a unique \nidentifier for each metadata record, which includes \nthe usual metadata parameters such as an abstract \ndescribing the data set in general terms; geographic \nbounding coordinates; data quality; and contact \ninformation. ANZLIC has been made compatible \nwith the ISO-19115 standard for geospatial metadata. \nAgain, as this is similar to the FGDC and ISO-19115 \nstandards, it will suffer from the same issues \nconcerning geomagnetic observatory data. \n7.5.4 IUGONET (Japan) \nIUGONET (Inter-university Upper atmosphere \nGlobal Observation NETwork) [33] is a cooperative \nprogram in Japan between the National Institute of \nPolar Research, Tohoku University, Nagoya \nUniversity, Kyoto University, and Kyushu University \nto expand the global radar, magnetometer and optical \nobservation equipment and ground-based network in \norder to enhance each agency's effective use of \nvarious observational data sets.  \nBecause of the diversity of the data from upper \natmosphere observations, the program is developing a \ndatabase for the metadata, which will include \nobservation times, location, equipment, data formats, \netc. to be made available on the internet. The \nmetadata will make the data understandable to all \nresearchers, and promote interdisciplinary research \nby a variety of different agencies, including those in \nfields other than that of upper atmosphere science. \nIUGONET will handle metadata in XML in the \nIUGONET format based on SPASE. Figure 7.8 \nshows an example of such metadata for the HF radar.  \n \nFig. 7.8 An example of metadata archived by the metadata database of IUGONET. All metadata are described as XML in the \nIUGONET format based on the SPASE model \n7.5.5 GeoNetwork (Open Source) \nThe GeoNetwork project [34] is an open-source and \nstandards-based application for managing and \ndelivering spatially referenced information and other \nresources via the internet. The software is intended to \nprovide access to a wide variety of data, metadata, \nand other kinds of information, obtained from \nmultiple disciplines, and organised and documented \nin standardised ways. It provides the ability to \nmanage and administer access to geospatial databases \ncontaining data and related metadata. It provides \nsupport for ISO-19115, FGDC and Dublin Core \nmetadata standards. It also incorporates various \nservices such as access to ESRI-based servers \nrunning the ArcIMS protocol. There are many \nagencies that use the GeoNetwork open source \nsystem to manage their metadata, including the \nGroup on Earth Observations [35]. \n \n7.6 Conclusion \nIn this chapter we have reviewed the range of \ngeomagnetic observatory data and indices that are \navailable to the scientific community. The types and \navailability of this data are summarised in Table 1. \nWe have seen that the type of data recorded and \nsupplied by observatory operators is not fixed for all \ntime. Extracting information from historical printed \ndata products are of interest to those examining \ntrends in long time-series data and current efforts \nworldwide to digitally capture this important \ninformation resource should be lauded. Furthermore, \nexciting developments in the supply of one-second \nand quasi-absolute data should have a significant \nimpact on the range and type of scientific analysis \nthat can be achieved. \nCuration of these important data sets for our and \nfuture generations is of utmost importance. This task \nhas been carried out with great care for over 50 years \nby the WDCs providing long-term data stewardship \nand free and open access to all. This is an interesting  \nTable 1 A Summary of the type of geomagnetic data available and where this data is available from \n  Data Sources \n  WD\nC\n-Edinburgh \nW\nD\nC\n-K\nyoto \nW\nD\nC\n-C\nopenhagen \nW\nD\nC\n-M\num\nbai \nW\nD\nC\n-STP M\noscow\n \nW\nD\nC\n-SEP M\noscow\n \nW\nD\nC\n-STP B\noulder \nW\nD\nC\n-G\nM\nG\n B\noulder \nW\nD\nC\n-Sydney \nW\nD\nC\n-B\neijing \nIN\nTER\nM\nA\nG\nN\nET \nISG\nI- LA\nTM\nO\nS \nISG\nI-G\nFZ \nISG\nI- Ebro \nDigital \nObservatory \nOne-Second \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 - - - - - - \uf06e\uf020 - - - -\uf020 -\uf020\nOne-Minute \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 - - \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e\uf020 - - \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020\nHourly Values \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e\uf020 - - - \uf06e\uf020 - -\uf020 \uf06e\uf020\nAnnual Means \uf06e\uf020 - - - - \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 - - - \uf06e\uf020 - -\uf020 - \nIndices Planetary \n(K-derived) \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e\uf020 - -\uf020 -\uf020 -\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 -\uf020\nStorm (Dst, \nASY\/SYM) -\uf020 \uf06e - \uf06e \uf06e - \uf06e\uf020 -\uf020 - - - \uf06e -\uf020 - \nAuroral (AE) -\uf020 \uf06e - \uf06e \uf06e - \uf06e\uf020 -\uf020 - - - \uf06e -\uf020 - \nPolar (PC) -\uf020 - \uf06e - \uf06e - -\uf020 -\uf020 - - - - -\uf020 - \nSSC\/SI \uf06e\uf020 - - - \uf06e - -\uf020 -\uf020 - - - \uf06e \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e \nSFE \uf06e\uf020 - - - -\uf020 - -\uf020 -\uf020 - - - -\uf020 -\uf020 \uf06e\uf020\nSolar \uf06e\uf020 - - \uf06e -\uf020 - \uf06e\uf020 -\uf020 \uf06e - - -\uf020 -\uf020 -\uf020\nOther \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e - - \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e\uf020 -\uf020 \uf06e - \uf06e -\uf020 -\uf020 -\uf020\nSurvey \nData \nRepeat \uf06e\uf020 - - - - - -\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 - - - - \uf06e\uf020 - \nLand\/Air\/Marine \uf06e\uf020 - - - - \uf06e -\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 - - - - -\uf020 - \nAnalogue Magnetograms \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 -\uf020 - - - \uf06e\uf020 - - -\uf020 -\uf020\nDigitised  \nMagnetograms \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e - - - -\uf020 - - - -\uf020 -\uf020\nYearbooks \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e - - - - -\uf020 - - - -\uf020 -\uf020\nOther \uf06e\uf020 -\uf020 \uf06e - -\uf020 \uf06e -\uf020 - - -\uf020 -\uf020 - -\uf020 -\uf020\nGlobal Magnetic Field Models \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e - - - \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e\uf020 - - - - -\uf020 - \nDigital Metadata Records \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e - - - - \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e\uf020 - \uf06e\uf020 \uf06e -\uf020 - \n \ntime for data centres as we move towards a new \nWorld Data System to replace WDCs and provide a \ndata service for the 21st century. INTERMAGNET \nand ISGI also play an important role in data \navailability, both in encouraging the establishment \nand improvement of standards at observatories and in \nthe standardisation and distribution of data sets. \nAs data are now recorded and distributed \nelectronically, important information about these data \nsets can become disassociated from the actual data. \nThese metadata are vital to gain a full understanding \nof the data and any treatment applied to it. IAGA \nhave recently recognised the importance of recording \nmetadata and there are numerous efforts within the \ngeomagnetism community to try and establish a way \nof capturing and distributing this important resource. \nThis is one of the most pressing and challenging tasks \nin geomagnetic data curation today; but if we can \nachieve consensus and standardisation the scientific \ncommunity will reap the benefits. \n \nAcknowledgments   The authors wish to thank David M. \nClark, Dr. Hans-Joachim Linthe, Dr. J\u00fcrgen Matzka and Dr. \nSusan Macmillan for their valued contributions.

The most prevalent standard for one-\nminute data is currently IAGA-2002 whereas WDC \nExchange Format is still often used for hourly mean \ndata. \nWorld Data Centre Exchange Format \nIn the 1980s a common file format for dissemination \nof geomagnetic data was developed. This WDC \nExchange Format [36] was a continuation from the \n26 \nformat for punched card and was designed to make \nmaximum use of the limited RAM and disk capacity \nof computers at that time. It is not a convenient \nformat for the user and there is no space for any \nmetadata. For hourly means each value is \ndecomposed into a tabular base value (shared by all \nhourly values for a given day), and a tabular value \n(Fig 7.9). For each day the tabular base and the 24 \nvalues are presented with a daily mean value at the \nend of the row.  For minute means each value in an \nhour is displayed along one horizontal row with an \nhourly mean value given at the end. \n \nINTERMAGNET GIN Dissemination Formats  \nINTERMAGNET defined a number of format \nstandards for the dissemination of data from their \nGINs [37]. There are standards for one-minute \n(IMFV1.22), hourly (IHFV1.01) and daily \n(IDFV1.01) data. For example, for one-minute \nmeans, data are organised on a day-file basis. One \nfile contains 24 one-hour blocks, each containing 60 \nminutes worth of values. Blocks are padded with 9's \nif incomplete. Information is encoded in ASCII and \nthere is only very limited metadata included e.g. \nnoting if data are reported, adjusted or definitive. \nESK DEC0109 335 00 HDZF R EDI 03473568 000000 RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR \n 174920 -022201  463428 495316   174931 -022205  463427 495320 \n 174937 -022207  463427 495321   174928 -022201  463427 495318 \n 174925 -022201  463427 495317   174931 -022209  463427 495320 \n\u2026 \nESK DEC0109 335 01 HDZF R EDI 03473568 000000 RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR \n 174923 -022227  463424 495313   174922 -022228  463424 495314 \n 174921 -022230  463424 495314   174924 -022232  463424 495313 \n 174924 -022232  463424 495313   174924 -022232  463423 495314 \n \u2026 \nESK DEC0109 335 02 HDZF R EDI 03473568 000000 RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR \n 174928 -022221  463420 495312   174926 -022223  463419 495312 \n 174926 -022225  463420 495311   174924 -022223  463420 495310 \n 174923 -022223  463420 495311   174924 -022221  463421 495311 \nIAGA-2002 Format \nThe IAGA ASCII Exchange Format [38] was \nadopted in 2001. It is used as a data exchange format \nfor geomagnetic data (samples and means) from \nobservatories and variometer stations at cadences \nfrom milliseconds up to and including monthly \nmeans. This ability to accommodate data of different \ncadence is a major strength of this file format. It is \nalso flexible and can account for files containing \ndifferent durations of data (e.g. a month file of one-\nminute data) with its well-defined file naming \nscheme. The file names themselves provide critical \nmetadata and within each file there are twelve \nmandatory file header records for further metadata. \nThese include the type of data (definitive, \nprovisional, variation), if the data are instantaneous \nor a mean, and how the values are centred. It also has \nan optional, variable length comment field for more \ndescriptive metadata associated with the dataset. The \ndata records are presented in a fixed four-column \nASCII format which is convenient for the user to read \nand manipulate. \n \n Format                 IAGA-2002                                    | \n Source of Data         Danish Meteorological Institute              | \n Station Name           Narsarsuaq                                   | \n IAGA CODE              NAQ                                          | \n Geodetic Latitude      61.160                                       | \n Geodetic Longitude     314.560                                      | \n Elevation              4                                            | \n Reported               XYZF                                         | \n Sensor Orientation     DIF                                          | \n Digital Sampling       0.01 seconds                                 | \n Data Interval Type     Filtered 1-minute (00:30 - 01:29)            | \n Data Type              Definitive                                   | \n # This area is where the data source or distributor can include     | \n # any additional information needed for proper use of data.         | \nDATE       TIME         DOY     NAQX      NAQY      NAQZ      NAQF   | \n2001-03-13 00:00:00.000 072     10800.11  -6100.23  53381.51  54801.12 \n2001-03-13 00:01:00.000 072     10800.31  -6100.20  53381.51  54801.12 \n2001-03-13 00:02:00.000 072     10801.11  -6101.23  99999.00  54801.12 \n2001-03-13 00:03:00.000 072     10803.12  -6100.23  99999.00  54801.12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig 7.9 WDC hourly mean value format, with the tabular base values highlighted \n \n \n27 \nAppendix 2: Internet Links \n [1] http:\/\/cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov \n [2] http:\/\/www.wdc.bgs.ac.uk \n [3] http:\/\/www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk\/data_service\/home.html  \n [4] http:\/\/wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp \n [5] http:\/\/wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp\/film \n [6] http:\/\/www.space.dtu.dk\/English.aspx \n [7] http:\/\/www.space.dtu.dk\/English\/Research\/Scientific_ \ndata_and_models\/World_Data_Center_for_Geomagneti\nsm.aspx  \n [8] http:\/\/www.wdciig.res.in  \n [9] http:\/\/www.wdcb.ru\/sep \n [10] http:\/\/www.wdcb.ru\/stp\/index.en.html \n [11] http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/stp\/WDC\/wdcstp.html \n [12] http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/mgg\/wdc\/wdcgmg.html \n [13] http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/mgg\/geodas\/trackline.html \n [14] http:\/\/www.ips.gov.au\/World_Data_Centre \n [15] http:\/\/gp.wdc.cn \n [16] http:\/\/www.intermagnet.org \n [17] http:\/\/www.icsu-fags.org \n [18] http:\/\/wds.geolinks.org \n [19] \nhttp:\/\/www.earthobservations.org\/documents\/geo_broch\nure.pdf \n [20] http:\/\/isgi.latmos.ipsl.fr \n [21]http:\/\/www-app3.gfz-potsdam.de\/kp_index\/index.html \n [22] http:\/\/www.obsebre.es\/php\/geomagnetisme\/variacior \nap.php \n [23] http:\/\/spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov\/spidr \n [24] http:\/\/supermag.jhuapl.edu \n [25] http:\/\/www.geo.fmi.fi\/image \n [26] http:\/\/bluebird.phys.ualberta.ca\/carisma \n [27] http:\/\/www.intermagnet.org\/Yearbooks_e.php \n [28] http:\/\/www.fgdc.gov\/metadata \n [29] http:\/\/www.opengeospatial.org \n [30] http:\/\/www.spase-group.org \n [31] http:\/\/www.w3schools.com\/xsl\/default.asp \n [32] http:\/\/www.geomind.eu\/portal\/md_search.jsf \n [33] http:\/\/www.iugonet.org\/en \n [34] http:\/\/geonetwork-opensource.org \n [35] http:\/\/www.geoportal.org\/web\/guest\/geo_home \n [36] http:\/\/www.wdc.bgs.ac.uk\/catalog\/format.html \n [37] http:\/\/www.intermagnet.org\/FormatData_e.php \n [38]http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/IAGA\/vdat\/ \niagaformat.html \n \nReferences \nAbston CC, Papitashvili NE and Papitashvili VO (1985) \nCombined International Catalog of Geomagnetic Data, \nReport UAG-92, U.S. National Geophysical Data \nCenter \nAkasofu S-I (1981) Relationships between the AE and Dst \nindices during geomagnetic storms.
