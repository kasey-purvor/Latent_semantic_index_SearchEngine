There is currently particular \ninterest in jet mixing especially for environmental impact consideration. The present \nwork uses the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) technique to study velocity and passive \nscalar mixing along with intermittency of a spatially evolving turbulent coaxial swirl \njet.  This approach computes the temporal development of large-scale flow structures \nby solving the transport equations for the spatially filtered mass, momentum and \npassive scalar. The finite volume technique applied on a Cartesian mesh is used for \nnumerical discretisation. All the simulations have been carried out for sufficiently \nlong time periods to ensure convergence of time averaged statistics calculated for both \nvelocity and scalar fields. The simulations captured the potential core and also \npredicted high level turbulence intensities in the inner mixing regions. The probability \ndensity functions (PDF) and radial intermittency plots revealed an intermittent mixing \nbehaviour especially in the outer region of the flow where the fluctuations of velocity \nrapidly change from rotational to irrotational and vice versa. The PDF and radial \nintermittency profiles exhibit Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions close to the jet \ncentreline and away from the centreline respectively.  \n \nKey Words: Coaxial jet, Swirl, Passive scalar mixing, intermittency, LES  \n \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nCoaxial jets with swirl are commonly found in various engineering applications and \nremain one of the challenging problems in fluids mechanics and combustion \napplications. Swirl is generally used to stabilise the flow by enhancing mixing and \nhence helps to stabilise the flame in combustion systems. In combustion applications, \nswirl-induced recirculation can reduce the flame length and hence reduce the \ncombustor length and cost. Depending on the strength of the swirl, recirculation zones \nand vortex breakdown (VB) can be formed in swirl stabilised flames. The formation \nof large scale coherent structure seen in swirl jets is responsible for instability in \nisothermal flows, and thermoacoustic instability in the combustion systems. There is \nthus a need for more research at both fundamental and design levels to improve the \noverall understanding of swirl based mechanisms, which can be effectively used to \naid the design process in practical engineering applications. \n \nDuring the past five decades, a number of theoretical and experimental studies have \nbeen carried out aiming to identify characteristics of swirling coaxial jets for various \nconfigurations including both unconfined and confined geometries. Ribeiro and \nWhitelow (1980) studied a coaxial jet with and without swirl while Roback and \nJohnson (1983) conducted experimental investigation for confined swirling coaxial jet \nand measured data for both the velocity and passive scalar fields. Gouldin et al. \n(1985) also investigated a coaxial swirl jet and discussed the velocity field \ncharacteristics, while Mattingly and Oates (1986) examined the mixing of coannular \nswirling flows. Billant et al. (1998) also studied the vortex breakdown and \nrecirculation motion of swirling jets.  Champagne and Kromat (2000) also studied the \nrecirculation in swirling coaxial jets, while Wicker and Eaton (2001) conducted swirl \neffects on particles in coaxial swirl jets. Giannadakis et al. (2008) recently examined \nthe influence of swirl on coaxial flow and discussed various results in addition to \nprevious experimental findings.  \n \nComputational modelling of swirl induced coaxial jets has complemented the  \nexperimental work and now acts as a useful tool to resolve multiscale flow problems \ncovering a wide range of length and time scales. Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes \n(RANS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) are \nthree well known techniques used for such turbulent flow analysis. Out of the three \ntechniques, LES is capable of capturing the unsteady three dimensional nature of \nturbulence with affordable computing power.  \n \nLES is a particularly useful technique to study high Reynolds number complex swirl \ninduced flow configurations due to their inherent unsteadiness and three dimensional \nstructures. Several groups have done state-of-art LES investigations for isothermal, \ncombustion, sprays flows that involves swirl. For example, Akselvoll and Moin \n(1996) first computed mixing of turbulent confined coaxial jets using LES and \ndiscussed key important aspects such as shear layer distributions, pressure field and \nalso compared results with the experimental data. Pierce and Moin (1998) \nsubsequently carried out a LES calculation of a confined coaxial swirl jet with heat \nrelease and studied the combustion process. Grinstein et al. (2002) simulated unsteady \nnon-reacting swirling flows in a fuel injector nozzle using the monotone integrated \nlarge eddy simulation (MILES) technique.  Apte el al. (2003) also conducted LES \ncalculations for a confined swirl flow configuration with particle simulations. Wang et \nal. (2004) performed LES of confined swirling flows and obtained encouraging \npredictions for VB, recirculation zones, and coherent structures of single swirling jets. \nLu et al. (2005) carried out a LES of turbulent swirling flows in a dump combustor \nand discussed the VB phenomena, shear layer instability, and vortico-acoustic \ninteractions. Dianat, et al. (2006) also studied the scalar mixing of a confined coaxial \njet using LES and discussed different numerical schemes for the discretisation of \nscalar transport equation. Garcia-Villalba et al. (2006) considered the large scale \ncoherent structures in the near field of confined coannular swirl jet. Wegner et al. \n(2007) studied the flow and mixing fields in a generic combustor using LES and \ndiscussed the flow features occurs in more generic combustor, while Wang et al. \n(2007) performed a series of calculations for a gas turbine swirl injector using LES \nand discussed various flow aspects in great detail.  \n \nThe intermittency behaviour of turbulent free shear flows also plays an important role \nsince it influences many engineering applications including aeroacoustics, mixing, \npropulsion, and combustion. In general, flowfield intermittency makes a round jet \nexhibit different structure in both the transitional and turbulent regions.  A few \nattempts have been made to study the intermittency of inhomogeneous free shear \nflows using classical RANS. For example, a \uf065\uf02dk  based intermittency model was \ndeveloped by Byggstoyl and Kollomann (1981). Kollmann and Janicka (1982) studied \nthe intermittency using a transport probability density function (PDF) approach. Cho \nand Chung (1992) also developed a more economical intermittency model by \nincorporating an intermittency transport equation into an already existing \n\uf065\uf02dk turbulence model. \n \nThe present work aims to study the flow field and mixing of an unconfined coaxial \nswirl jet using LES. The configuration considered here is a scaled version of a typical \nRB211 engine exhaust using the engine characteristics provided by Garner et al. \n(1997). The aim was to study the velocity field, passive scalar mixing and their \nintermittent behaviour for such a coaxial swirl jet. The outcome of this work will be \neventually used to further analyse the hot gas jet for emission distributions.  Here we \ndiscuss transient and time averaged quantities for both velocity and passive scalar \nfields together with the corresponding probability density functions and intermittency \nprofiles. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in section II, we will \ndiscuss the governing equations and modelling. In section III, we will give a detailed \ndescription of the numerical setup for both simulations.  Section IV will discuss the \nresults from these simulations for both velocity and passive scalar fields. Finally, we \nend the paper with conclusions in section V.   \n \nII. GOVERNING EQUATIONS \nIn LES the large-scale energy containing scales of motion are resolved numerically \nwhile the small, unresolved scales and their interactions with the large scales are \nmodelled.  The grid-filtering operator, known as a spatial filter, is applied to \ndecompose the resolved and sub-grid scales in the computational domain. Applying \nthe spatial box filter to incompressible governing equations, we obtain the filtered \ncontinuity, momentum and passive scalar equations for the large-scale motion as \nfollows: \n0\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\nj\nj\nx\nu\n,  (1) \nj\nij\nj\nij\nij\njii\nxx\nS\nx\nP\nx\nuu\nt\nu\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6 )()2(1)( \uf074\uf06e\n\uf072\n, (2) \njjt\nt\nj\nj\nxx\nc\nx\ncu\nt\nc\n\uf0b6\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6 2\n)(\n)(\n\uf073\n\uf06e\n\uf073\n\uf06e\n,       (3) \nWhere \uf073\uf06e\uf072 ,,,,, cpu i and t\uf073 denote the velocity, density, pressure, kinematic \nviscosity, passive scalar concentration, laminar and turbulent Schmidt numbers, and \nthe strain rate tensor, \n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf03d\ni\nj\nj\ni\nij\nx\nu\nx\nu\nS\n2\n1\n.

NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES \nA. Computational domain, flow conditions and grid resolution \nThe coaxial swirl jet has a core jet with a diameter 0.878cD m\uf03d  which is surrounded \nby an annular secondary jet with diameter 1.422aD m\uf03d . The centre of the core jet is \ntaken as the geometric centre line of the flow where 0\uf03dr and 0\uf03dx . Two independent \nbulk axial velocities are used to describe the inlet velocities for the simulations, the \nbulk axial velocity of the core jet, 158 \/cU m s\uf03d , the bulk axial velocity of the \nsecondary annular inlet, 104 \/aU m s\uf03d . The swirl velocity is introduced into the \nannular jet at exit with the swirl number defined as the ratio between the axial flux of \nthe swirl momentum, \uf066G   (\n22skgm \uf02d ), to the axial flux of the axial momentum xG  \n(\n22skgm \uf02d ) multiplied by a characteristic lengthR )m( . Here we take the radius of the \nswirl annulus as the characteristic radius. The swirl number is given by \n \n\uf0f2\n\uf0f2\n\uf03d\uf03d\nR\nR\nx\nrdrUR\ndrUWr\nRG\nG\nS\n0\n2\n0\n2\n\uf066\n (6) \nWhere U  (m\/s)  and W (m\/s)  are the mean axial and tangential velocities at the exit \nplane of the swirl generator. In this work, we have adopted a swirl number of 0.225, \nwhich is consistent with the swirl number used by Tucker (2004) for his swirl induced \njet noise calculations. The Reynolds number is defined in terms of the primary (bulk) \naxial velocity \uf028 \uf029U  diameter of the core jet annulus )(D  and the kinematic viscosity of \nair \uf06e  such that \uf06eUD\uf03dRe .  \n \nThe computational domain considered extended 30 core jet diameters radially and 40 \ncore jet diameters axially with dimensions of approximately mmm 422626 \uf0b4\uf0b4 , for \nwhich 120140140 \uf0b4\uf0b4  (2.3 million) points Cartesian grid aligned along the x,y and z \ndirections respectively was used. The grid lines in the x  and y  directions used an \nexpansion ratio of ( ) ( 1) 1.08xy x i x i\uf067 \uf03d \uf044 \uf044 \uf02d \uf03d  and an expansion ratio of 07.1\uf03dz\uf067  \nwas used in the z-direction. A grid sensitivity analysis was performed earlier and \nshowed that reasonable grid independence is achieved for the present work. \n \nThe inflow mean axial velocity for the core and annular jets, the inflow mean swirl \nvelocity for the annular jet were specified using the power low velocity profile such \nthat \n \n7\/1\n0 1 \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf03e\uf03d\uf03c\nr\ny\nUCU j  (7) \nwhere jU  is bulk velocity, y  is the radial distance from the jet centre line and r is the \nradius of the jet. We have used the constant 28.10 \uf03dC , which is consistent with a fully \ndeveloped turbulent pipe flow outlet.  The turbulence fluctuations are generated from \na Gaussian random number generator and added to the mean velocity profiles. The \nmethod of turbulence generation using a Gaussian random number generator \nespecially for complex swirl flow configurations is consistent and shows good \nagreement with other inflow generation methods for the swirling flames (Kempf et. al \n2008). A free slip boundary condition is used for the side walls and convective outlet \nboundary condition is applied at the outflow for velocities.  For the passive scalar, a \ntop hat profile is specified at the inlet such that for one case, the passive scalar value \nis 1.0 at core inlet and 0 elsewhere, while for the second case the passive scalar value \nis 1.0 at annular inlet and 0 elsewhere. For the scalar a zero normal gradient condition \nis used at outlet. \n \nThe time averaged mean axial and radial velocities, mean passive scalar components \nand their mean fluctuating values are calculated by time averaging the unsteady \nvariables obtained from LES results, i.e. \n                              2\n1 1\n1 1\n, ( )\nt tN Nn n\nrms\nn nt tN N\n\uf066 \uf066 \uf066 \uf066 \uf066\n\uf03d \uf03d\n\uf03c \uf03e\uf03d \uf03d \uf02d \uf03c \uf03e\uf0e5 \uf0e5  (8) \nWhere  \ntN  represents the number of samples.  \nThe simulations are carried out for ten flow passes transiently and then the statistics \ncollected over another ten flow passes. This allows the flow field to fully develop and \ninitial transients to exit the computational domain. The samples are only taken after \nthe flow field has fully developed.  \n \nB. Numerical discretisation \nThe program used to perform the simulations is the PUFFIN code developed by \nKirkpatrick et al. (2003a, b, 2005) and later extended by Ranga Dinesh (2007). This \nLES code has been extensively validated for various applications such as turbulent \nisothermal swirling jets (Malalasekera et al., 2007) and turbulent swirling non-\npremixed flames (Malalasekera et al, 2008, Kempf et al. 2008). PUFFIN computes the \ntemporal development of large-scale flow structures by solving the transport \nequations for the spatially filtered continuity, momentum and passive scalar. The \nequations are discretised in space with the finite volume formulation using Cartesian \ncoordinates on a non-uniform staggered grid. A second order central differencing \nscheme (CDS) is used for the spatial discretisation of all terms in both the momentum \nequation and the pressure correction equation. This minimises the projection error and \nensures convergence in conjunction with an iterative solver. The diffusion terms of \nthe passive scalar transport equation are also discretised using the second order CDS. \nThe convection term of the scalar transport equation is discretised using the SHARP \nscheme (Leonard, 1987).  \nThe time derivative of the mixture fraction is approximated using the Crank-Nicolson \nscheme. The momentum equations are integrated in time using a second order hybrid \nscheme. Advection terms are calculated explicitly using second order Adams-\nBashforth, while diffusion terms are calculated implicitly using second order Adams-\nMoulton to yield an approximate solution for the velocity field. Finally, mass \nconservation is enforced through a pressure correction step.  \n \nThe time step is varied to ensure that the Courant number iio xtuC \uf044\uf044\uf03d remains \napproximately constant where \nix\uf044  is the cell width, t\uf044  is the time step and iu  is the \nvelocity component in the ix  direction. The solution is advanced with a time stepping \ncorresponding to a Courant number in the range of \uf03doC 0.3 to 0.5.  The Bi-Conjugate \nGradient Stabilized (BiCGStab) method with a Modified Strongly Implicit (MSI) \npreconditioner is used to solve the system of algebraic equations resulting from the \ndiscretisation.  \n \n \nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \nThis section discusses the results obtained from the LES calculations. First we discuss \nthe velocity fields and then describe the passive scalar fields for two cases considered. \nBoth sections discuss the velocity and passive scalar fields based on instantaneous and \ntime averaged quantities for different axial locations. The radial plots of the mean and \nrms quantities have been normalised by the diameter of the annular jet )( aD .  \nAnalysis of the results for velocity field \nContour plots for the mean axial and swirl velocities are shown in Figure 1 a,b. The \ncentreline mean axial velocity is only minimally influenced by the annular swirl in the \nnear field, (0 \/ 5.0)x D\uf03c \uf03c , but the contour plot for the mean swirling velocity \n(Figure 1, b) displays an overall axi-symmetric distribution of the mean swirl velocity \nwith the largest values found close to the annular inlet and then decaying further \ndownstream. The swirl velocity results in a higher spreading rate for the flow field \nand faster decay for the mean axial velocity in the near field as observed by other \ninvestigators in their LES calculations for a coaxial swirl jet in unconfined \nenvironment (Garcia-Villalba et al., 2006, Frohlich et al., 2008).  \n \nFigure 2 (a,b) show the velocity vector field obtained from the time averaged mean \nvelocities, which shows the development of the mean velocity profiles and its \nexpansion in the radial direction within the intermediate and far field regions. \nHowever, a typical swirl induced recirculation zone (Gupta et al. 1984) does not \nappear, with absence of low pressure regions in the flow field, due to the existing low \nswirl number we used of 0.225. The vector field also shows that the jet has an \noutward radial component due to the centrifugal forces which widens considerably at \nfurther downstream locations. \n \nFigure 3 shows contours of instantaneous passive scalar levels and indicates two shear \nlayers produced for the simulated coaxial swirl jet with the inner layer forming \nbetween the core jet and the annular jet and the outer layer established at the border \nbetween the annular region and surrounding flow. The shear layers contain curvatures \nas a result of swirl and the presence of swirl produces a pressure drop in the \nmomentum transport equations and increases the centrifugal force close to the annular \nregion (Gupta et al. 1984). The addition of swirl also increases the turbulence and thus \nincreases the velocity fluctuations especially in the inner mixing region. The vortices \nstart to roll up at a close distance to the inlets due to the centrifugal force and the rate \nof spreading increases sharply between the shear layers which significantly enhance \nthe mixing. The existence of small eddies and their roll-up also increases the \nintermittency in both velocity and scalar fields.  \n \nThe radial plots of the time averaged mean axial velocity are shown in Figure 4. The \nprofiles extended from x\/D=0.5 to x\/D=30.0 and the plots show that the mean axial \nvelocity follows the axi-symmetric behaviour.  With the additions of swirl, radial \nspread of the mean axial velocity increases in intermediate regions (x\/D=3.0, 5.0) and \npossesses a flat region at far field axial locations. The existence of the swirl velocity \nalso reduces the higher axial momentum generated from the inlet axial velocities and \nhence increases the spread rate of the axial velocity towards radial direction. As \nreported in literature a weak coflow is usually introduced in the simulations of \nturbulent free jets (Stanley et al. 2002) and hence has no significant effect for the jet \ndynamics. However, higher coannular jet velocity does affect the central jet \nmomentum seen in the present case.  \n \nFigure 5 shows the time averaged mean radial velocity at x\/D=0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, \n10.0, 20.0, 30.0.  The mean radial velocity is close to zero near the centreline at all \naxial locations and sharply reduces to negative values above the annular jet due to the \nswirl velocity. A sudden reduction of the mean radial velocity is also visible at near \nfield axial locations such as x\/D=0.5, 1.0, 2.0. The reduction of the mean radial \nvelocity over the annular jet is smooth for intermediate region and possesses a flat \nshape at far field axial locations. Time averaged mean swirling velocity is shown in \nFigure 6. Since the swirl velocity component is introduced from the annular jet with \nswirl number 0.225, the radial profiles of the mean swirl velocity has higher values \nabove the annular inlet. These higher swirling velocity values has extend up to \nx\/D=10 and then gradually decrease at far field locations.  \n \nFigures 7-9 show the root mean square (rms) fluctuations of axial, radial and swirling \nvelocities. The highest peak value of the rms axial fluctuation appears at r\/D=-0.5, 0.5 \n(Figure 7) which is a direct consequence of the vortex shedding in the inner mixing \nregion between inner potential core and outer potential core.  Further downstream the \naxial fluctuation follows the same profile shape as mean axial velocity.  As seen in \nFigure 8, the rms radial fluctuation has a small peak in region above the annular jet \nand eventually increases the peak value at intermediate regions (x\/D=2.0, 3.0, 5.0). \nThe maximum peak values are significantly lower than those for the rms axial \nfluctuations, as also observed by Ribeiro and Whitelaw (1980) for their coaxial swirl \nexperiment. The centreline fluctuations increase in the far field and follow the same \ndistribution shape as the rms axial velocity at x\/D=10.0, 20.0, 30.0 while axial and \nradial fluctuations values are much the same at downstream axial locations. The rms \nswirling fluctuations (Figure 9) also follow the same profile shape as radial \nfluctuations, but the peak values are higher than rms radial fluctuations and lower than \nthe rms axial fluctuations at near field axial locations.  \n \nThe overall agreement for the time averaged velocity components between the present \nwork and previous experimental studies undertaken by Gupta et al. (1984), Bender \nand Buchner (2005), and previous numerical studies carried out by McIIwain and \nPollard (2002), Garcia-Villalba et al. (2006) is found to be consistent. Thus the \npresent results suggest that the LES technique can provide reliable details for the \ncoaxial swirl jet development. However since turbulent free shear flows display an \nintermittent behaviour, future analysis on intermittency of intermittency on both \nvelocity and passive scalar would seems to be useful in the presence of swirl.  \n \nAnalysis of the results for scalar field \nThe passive scalar distributions have been studied for two further cases. Case 1 \nsimulated the scalar distribution by setting the scalar value to 1 for the inlet core and \nzero elsewhere, while case 2 simulated the scalar distribution by specifying a value of \n1 for the inlet annular jet and zero elsewhere. Both simulations have been done \nindependently and statistics collected for the time averaged calculations.  \n \nFigure 10 and 11 show the snapshots and filtered passive scalars for case 1 and case 2 \nrespectively. Since the swirl velocity was introduced via the annular jet, the swirl \neffect on core is not significant and produces less mixing in near field region for case \n1. Furthermore the axial velocity ratio between the core and annular jets is high (1.48) \nand hence the dominant higher core jet velocity takes the passive scalar further down \nwith less mixing for case 1. The swirl velocity gradually increases its effect on core \njet within the intermediate region which helps to form different vortex patterns and to \nspread the scalar value radially at downstream axial locations. However, the mixing is \ndifferent for case 2 in which, the swirl velocity is introduced via the annular jet where \nthe passive scalar value is now initialised as 1 at inlet. As seen in Figure 11, the \npassive scalar for case 2 shows more mixing within the intermediate region due to the \ndirect impact of the swirl velocity. The swirl induced vortical structures directly help \nto enhance the mixing at this stage of development. The different effect of swirl on \nthe passive scalar mixing for both cases is confirmed by the radial plots of the time \naveraged mean passive scalars at different axial locations (Figure 12).   \n \nThe mean passive scalar follows the Gaussian shape in both near and far fields. The \nradial profiles for case 1 show less mixing close to centreline at the more upstream \nlocations (x\/D=0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0). The radial spread of the passive scalar starts to \nexpand more at downstream positions. In case 2, the scalar values distribute more \ntowards the radial direction with a reduced maximum value in intermediate regions \ndue to the direct effect of the swirl velocity. However, the swirl velocity has a greater \neffect on mixing for case 1 than case 2 in the far field and hence absolute scalar \nvalues for case 1 reduce more than values for case 2 on the plots (x\/D=20.0,30.0). \nThis analysis shows that the spreading rate of the passive scalar changes with respect \nto swirl strength and its local velocity value in each case. Significant intermittency in \nboth velocity and passive scalar fields can be expected and hence investigations of \nprobability density functions and radial spread of the intermittency of both velocity \nand passive scalar be useful to explain the changes occurring in flow mixing in the \ntwo cases considered. \n \nAnalysis of the results for intermittency \nThe intermittency is another important physical issue that could influence with the \nmixing process. Turbulent free shear flows with free boundaries as considered in the \npresent work display an intermittent behaviour especially close to the outer edge of \nthe flow where the flow alternates between rotational and irrotational states. \nMathematically, intermittency can be classified using an indicator function with the \nvalue of one in turbulent regions and zero in non-turbulent regions. It represents the \nfraction of a time interval during which a point is inside the turbulent fluid. Here we \nconsider the derivation of intermittency for both velocity and passive scalar fields for \nthe coaxial swirl jet. A variety of methods exist for determining the intermittency of a \nflow.  A normalised histogram method experimentally tested by Andreotti (1999) is \ncommonly used to estimate the probability density function (PDF). The intermittency \nvalue can be calculated using a summation of probability values with a threshold for \ngiven instantaneous values. Here we assume that the PDF is smooth at the scale of \none histogram bin and calculate PDF\u2019s similar to the method used by Schefer and \nDibble (2001). We consider more than 8000 measurements and at each selected \nspatial location are 50 bins over the 3 \uf073\uf02d  limits of the data. The PDF\u2019s are \nnormalised and thus  \n \n\uf028 \uf029\n1\n0\n1P f df \uf03d\uf0f2  \nTherefore the intermittency value \uf067 can be obtained from the probability values in the \npresence of a threshold value such that  \n( )thP f f\uf067 \uf03d \uf03e  \nHere we selected a threshold value of 13.1 m\/s for the velocity which is equal to \n( ) \/10c aU U\uf02b and a threshold value of 0.015 for the passive scalar which is similar to \nthe value considered by Schefer and Dibble (2001) for their intermittency of an \nisolated round jet. Figures 13 and 14 shows the probability density distributions \n(PDF) of the instantaneous axial velocity and passive scalar at x\/D=30. The PDF\u2019s of \nthe velocity exhibit Gaussian shape close to the centreline, Figure 13(a,b). However, \nthe PDF shape is shifting to non-Gaussianity with increase radial distance and thus \nindicates high rotational to irrotational variations towards the outer edge of the flow. \nThis feature can be further studied using the radial intermittency plots. The pdfs of \npassive scalar also follow the same behaviour and shows a Gaussian shape \nintermittency in Figure 14 (a,b) and then non-Gaussian at far field radial locations.  \nThe Gaussian like distributions are relatively wider near the centreline (Figure 13,14 \n(a,b)) and getting smaller with the increase radial distance  (Figure 13,14 (c,d)) for \nboth velocity and passive scalar fields. \n \nFigure 15 shows the radial variation of velocity intermittency at x\/D= 10, 20 and 30. \nThe velocity intermittency value is unity in the centreline region at x\/D=10,20, but \nsuddenly start to drop down at x\/D=30 in the region close to the centreline. The value \nof unity indicates a fully turbulent situation on the centreline. The velocity \nintermittency plot at x\/D=10 indicates only a low level intermittent behaviour and \neventually a change to laminar flow with increased radial distance. The intermittent \nbehaviour of the velocity increased at x\/D=20, 30 and shifts to a non-Gaussian shape \nat x\/D=30. The addition of swirl from the annular stream creates more complex flow \npatterns in the instantaneous flow field and thus more highly intermittent behaviour \nfor the coaxial swirl jet. The radial variation of the passive scalar intermittency is \nshown in Figure 16. It can be seen that the radial spread of the passive scalar \nintermittency is wider than that observed for the velocity field.  Moving from the \ncentreline into a region with 0 1\uf067\uf03c \uf03c  an unmixed surrounding medium is observed. \nThe intermittency profiles for velocity and passive scalar are similar at near field \n(x\/D=10) and differences are wider at x\/D=20 and 30. The intermittency of passive \nscalar shows more rotational\/irrotational variations in the region 0.5<r\/D<4 at x\/D=20 \nand 30. The profiles also follow the Gaussian shape at all three axial locations.    \n \nV. CONCLUSION  \nA turbulent swirling coaxial swirl jet with high inlet axial velocities has been \nsimulated using LES. Swirl has been introduced into the initial annular jet with a swirl \nnumber of 0.225.  A passive scalar was introduced into the core and annular jet \nregions separately. The simulations produced both instantaneous and time averaged \nquantities to describe the flow and mixing fields. Radial plots of mean and rms of \nvelocity field have been discussed along with the corresponding passive scalar \ndistributions.  The mean and fluctuation fields captured the potential cores and higher \nturbulence levels inside the inner mixing regions due to vortex shedding. The time \naveraged mean scalar distributions demonstrated the impact of the swirl on coaxial jet \nmixing at near field and far field locations. The calculated mean velocities, rms \nfluctuations and passive scalar results suggest that the coaxial swirl jet exhibits \nintermittent behaviour in some regions of the flow and the corresponding \nintermittency profiled have been obtained for both velocity and scalar fields. Derived \nprobability density functions for both velocity and passive scalar indicate complex \nmixing and radial intermittency plots reveal sudden changes between rotational and \nirrotational in the regions outer edge of the flow domain. The rapid mixing process \nalso benefited by the swirl velocity component introduced from the annular inlet.   \n \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT  \nWe are grateful to the EPSRC for their financial support under grant EP\/E036945\/1 \non the Modelling and Simulation of Intermittent Flows.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \nAkselvoll, K, Moin, P.
