Currently, 84 woodlands of different sizes  of Scots pine woodland 39 \nin Scotland are recognized as native (Anonymous, 1998). In total these constitute less 40 \nthan 1% of the maximum postglacial range and represent the only recognised UK 41 \nresource for this habitat, Caledonian pinewood, which receives protection under the EC 42 \nHabitats directive. These pinewoods represent the north-western extreme of the species\u201f 43 \ndistribution, which is one of the widest of all conifers, extending from northern Finland to 44 \nTurkey and from western Spain to eastern Siberia (Critchfield and Little, 1965), covering 45 \na huge range of environments. In many places Scots pine is also a commercially important 46 \ntimber species, its wood being used for construction, furniture and other products. In 47 \nScotland, native trees of commercially desirable form persist in the relatively large 48 \npopulations of e.g. Abernethy, Rothiemurchus and Glen Tanar (Mason et al., 2004). 49 \n 3 \nRecognition of the biological, cultural and recreational value of the species to Scotland 50 \nhas resulted in initiation of replanting programmes, and the commercial prospects for 51 \nnative pine are currently being re-evaluated, e.g. in \u201eDeveloping the Scots Pine Resource\u201f 52 \nproject in collaboration with institutes from the Nordic Countries (Macdonald et al., 53 \n2008). 54 \n 55 \nAdaptation to local climatic conditions through genetic differentiation is a widespread 56 \nfeature of forest tree species (Howe et al., 2003; Savolainen et al., 2007). This 57 \ncharacteristic is of high importance for strategies focused on conservation of genetic 58 \nresources, especially under changing environments. The use of maladapted planting stock 59 \nor the uncontrolled translocation of non-local provenances may lead to losses in 60 \nproductivity or dilution of local gene pools, impacts to which highly reduced or 61 \nfragmented populations may be especially vulnerable (McKay et al., 2005). Despite the 62 \nmany unique characteristics of Scottish pinewoods, the extent of possible local adaptation 63 \nhas not been studied in detail.. The aims of this paper are to review current knowledge 64 \nabout the evolution of pinewoods in Scotland and to demonstrate how understanding the 65 \nspecies\u201f history and evolution could provide valuable information with which to refine 66 \ncurrent guidance on  the conservation and expansion of the existing pinewood resources.  67 \nThis is particularly timely given the Scottish government\u201fs aim of increasing forest land 68 \ncover from 17.1 to 25%  (Scottish Forestry Policy 2006, 2006).  69 \n 70 \nRe-colonisation and history of pinewoods in Scotland 71 \n 72 \nThe last glaciation has strongly influenced the distributions of numerous species in 73 \nEurope as, during the last glacial maximum 23 000 \u2013 18 000 years ago, ice covered the 74 \n 4 \nmajority of northern Europe (Svendsen et al., 1999). Pine survived through the ice age in 75 \nthe Iberian, Italian and Balkan peninsulas (Bennett et al., 1991), but macrofossil evidence 76 \nfor refugia have also been found in central parts of Europe (Birks and Willis, 2008; Willis 77 \net al., 2000; Willis and van Andel, 2004). Climate modelling suggests that these areas 78 \nwould have been suitable for pine at that time (Cheddadi et al., 2006). Populations from 79 \nthe Iberian and Apennine Peninsulas harbour unique seed-transmitted mitochondrial DNA 80 \n(mtDNA) variation that is not found elsewhere in Europe (Cheddadi et al., 2006; 81 \nPyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al., 2008; Sinclair et al., 1999; Soranzo et al., 2000), and the Iberian 82 \npinewoods have also been found to differ from other continental populations for 83 \nmonoterpene and allozyme variation (Prus-Glowacki and Stephan, 1994; Tobolski and 84 \nHanover, 1971). These patterns support the view that more northern pine populations 85 \noriginate from refugia located north of the southern peninsulas and south of permafrost.   86 \n 87 \nAccording to pollen studies, pine reached Scotland about 8,000 years ago and, appeared 88 \nfirst in the Wester Ross area in the northwest, and then shortly afterwards in the 89 \nCairngorms (Birks, 1989), the latter presumably having spread northwards through 90 \nEngland (Bennett, 1995). Interpreting pollen data in species like pine can be challenging 91 \ndue to its abundance and long dispersal distances, and therefore macrofossil data are 92 \nneeded to verify presence of local populations (Birks, 2003). In fact, fossil stomata from 93 \ntwo sites in the Highlands indicate that pine was locally present 1,600-600 years earlier 94 \nthan suggested by pollen data (Froyd, 2005). Contemporary populations from Wester 95 \nRoss differ from those in the rest of Scotland in their allozyme and monoterpene 96 \nfrequencies, suggesting that the contemporary Scottish population derives from multiple 97 \nrefugia (Forrest, 1980; Forrest, 1982; Kinloch et al., 1986). For example, in contrast to the 98 \nrest of the populations, the frequency of 3-carene in the northwest is very low (Forrest, 99 \n 5 \n1980); biochemically, populations from this area seem more closely related to southern 100 \nEuropean populations than those from north-central Europe, which are similar to the rest 101 \nof the Scottish pinewoods (Forrest, 1982). It is possible that the north-western trees 102 \noriginate from refugia near southwest Ireland or western France (Ballantyne and Harris, 103 \n1994; Bennett, 1995), but this has not yet been verified by analysis of Irish macrofossils 104 \nor potentially native pinewood remnants. Alternatively natural selection or genetic drift 105 \n(random loss of genetic diversity due to e.g. sudden decrease in population size) may 106 \naccount for the differences, as these populations are on the edge of the species\u201f range and 107 \nunder strong oceanic influence. The wet, mild climate is markedly different from that in 108 \nother parts of the range and provides potentially divergent selective pressures involving, 109 \nfor example, pathogen attack, which may have driven biochemical differentiation. 110 \nBiochemical similarity between northwest Scotland and southern Europe may reflect the 111 \neffects of adaptation in a similar direction. However, if variation was due to drift, this 112 \nwould imply lack of gene flow between populations in western Scotland and elsewhere. In 113 \ntheir mtDNA study, Sinclair et al. (1999) found two molecular variants in Scotland, the 114 \nless common type being found in the western part of Scotland. Such differentiation 115 \nfurther supports the view of colonization from two directions. Similarly, multiple origins 116 \nmight be suggested by the presence of a unique, paternally-inherited chloroplast DNA 117 \n(cpDNA) microsatellite allele that was found only in the Wester Ross area (Provan et al., 118 \n1998). However, this variant could also represent a recent mutation. Had it been an 119 \nancestral polymorphism it would have been surprising that the allele was restricted to the 120 \narea, considering efficient pollen-mediated transmission of cpDNA. Currently, the low 121 \nnumber of mtDNA haplotypes detected prevents precise definition of the colonisation 122 \nroutes of pine in Europe (Naydenov et al., 2007; Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al., 2008; Sinclair et al., 123 \n1999), but further evidence for separate evolutionary origins of eastern and western 124 \n 6 \npinewoods in Scotland has recently been found in candidate gene variation (Wachowiak 125 \net al., 2010).  126 \n 127 \nCurrent status of native Scottish pinewoods 128 \n 129 \nDuring its history in Scotland, pine has fluctuated in abundance, sometimes very rapidly, 130 \ndue to various factors such as competition from deciduous tree species, decrease of 131 \ndeciduous forests, climate change and human activity (Bennett, 1995). Nowadays, the 132 \nonly natural pinewoods on the British Isles are patchily distributed in Scotland from 133 \nlatitude 55 \u00baN to 57 \u00baN and from longitude 3 \u00baW to 1 \u00baW at altitudes up to 600 metres 134 \n(Mason et al., 2004). According to the most recent available estimate, the native 135 \npinewood area in Scotland covers 18,000 hectares in 84 separate pinewoods varying in 136 \nsize from less than one to over 2,000 ha (Anonymous, 1998); some populations are small 137 \nand sparse consisting of little more than 100 trees at a density of less than one tree per 138 \nhectare (e.g. Martin, 1995). A substantial number of the native populations were already 139 \nidentified and described in the influential book \u201eThe Native Pinewoods of Scotland\u201f by 140 \nSteven and Carlisle (1959). Natural pinewood regeneration is often prevented by grazing 141 \nof domestic livestock or wild deer, muir burning and planting of non-native trees 142 \n(Anonymous, 1998), and many of the populations have been reduced to very small 143 \nnumbers due to human interference. Also, in the past, trees of poor growth form have 144 \noften been left in the forests while those considered to be superior from the silvicultural 145 \nperspective have been felled and extracted for timber (Mason et al., 2004).  In such cases, 146 \nthe surviving trees could negatively affect the quality of later generations if they 147 \ncontribute to mating (Ennos et al., 1998; Mason et al., 2004). However, the extent of such 148 \npractices is not known. In addition, undocumented quantities of trees of continental origin 149 \n 7 \nhave been introduced to Scotland since the 19th century (Forrest and Fletcher, 1995; 150 \nTaylor, 1993) which potentially could cause genetic contamination of local populations 151 \nvia pollen flow. The coverage of Scots pine plantations, which are mainly used for timber 152 \nproduction, totals 100,000 ha (Mason et al., 2004). However, the extent to which they 153 \ncontribute to the pollen pool in Scotland is not known.   154 \n 155 \nManagement of pinewoods in Scotland 156 \n 157 \nSince the late 1980s protection and expansion of pinewoods has been included in various 158 \npolicies and grant schemes (Mason et al., 2004). For example, the \u201eNative Pinewood 159 \nGrant Scheme\u201f between 1989 and 2004 aided the regeneration of existing pinewoods and 160 \ncreated 48,000 ha of new pinewoods (16% natural regeneration, 84% plantations) while 161 \nthe \u201eNative Pinewood Habitat Action Plan\u201f aimed at increasing the remnant pinewood 162 \narea by 5,600 ha by 2005 and assisting natural regeneration (McIntosh, 2006). However, 163 \nthere are no recent estimates available on the overall success of these projects or current 164 \ncoverage of (semi-)natural pinewoods. To guide seed transfers, the Scottish pinewoods 165 \nhave been divided into seven seed zones (figure 1) such that when (semi)-natural 166 \npinewoods are being expanded, in order to qualify for grant support, planting stock must 167 \ncome from within the same seed zone in an attempt to protect the local \u201cgenetic integrity\u201d 168 \n(Anonymous, 1998). For other planting objectives, such as timber production, the rules 169 \nare somewhat less restrictive. The seed zones are based largely on monoterpene studies 170 \n(Forrest, 1980) so that biochemically similar pinewoods are clustered within one zone.  171 \n[Figure 1] 172 \n 173 \n 8 \nThe general purpose of seed transfer guidelines in forestry is to prevent planting of 174 \nmaladapted trees and to maximise survival and growth. Ideally, management of any 175 \neconomically important tree species would include transfer restrictions, zoning species on 176 \nthe basis of climate, soil and topography and the results of provenance trials replicated in 177 \nmultiple environments (White et al., 2007). In other words, guidelines would take into 178 \naccount broadly-assessed patterns of local adaptation, with quantified evaluation of the 179 \nphenotypic effects of seed transfers along environmental gradients. As adaptation is 180 \ndriven by the environment, and the spatial scale of environmental heterogeneity can differ 181 \nwidely among regions, transfer rules are not easily transferable between different 182 \ncountries. Although apparently practical where field data are in short supply, applying 183 \nsingle-source data (such as monoterpenes and allozymes which can be considered 184 \nselectively neutral molecular markers) to devise seed zones is likely, at best, to poorly 185 \nreflect adaptive patterns (McKay and Latta, 2002; Meril\u00e4 and Crnokrak, 2001) or, at 186 \nworst, result in detrimental effects on survival and growth if environmental conditions 187 \nvary greatly among the origin of seed and the plantation site. Hence, whilst variation at 188 \nmolecular markers can accurately reflect other evolutionary features, such as population 189 \nstructure, demography and mating system (i.e. relative levels of inbreeding and 190 \noutbreeding), they should be applied in combination with data on environments and 191 \nadaptively significant traits if seed zoning is to be meaningful.  192 \n 193 \nLocal adaptation is common in trees 194 \n 195 \nAdaptations to local climate conditions have been described in many tree species using 196 \nprovenance trials (see Howe et al., 2003; Savolainen et al., 2007 for reviews) and in Scots 197 \npine in other parts of its range. Despite significant phenotypic differentiation, molecular 198 \n 9 \nmarker variation may show an opposite trend: due to efficient pollen-mediated mixing of 199 \npollen pools even distant populations can seem very similar at molecular markers that are 200 \nnot under selection (e.g. Karhu et al., 1996). Phenotypic divergence is mostly driven by 201 \nenvironmental variation among sites. In the Northern hemisphere, due to differences in 202 \nlength of the growing season and in the severity of seasonal periods of stress, trees 203 \nalternate between periods of active growth and dormancy in order to avoid frost damage 204 \nin the spring or the autumn (Howe et al., 2003), and traits chosen for studies are usually 205 \nexpected to be linked to these environmental factors. Growth patterns of Scots pine have 206 \nbeen extensively studied and, for example, timing of growth cessation is thought to be 207 \ninfluenced by both photoperiod and accumulated temperature (Koski and Siev\u00e4nen, 208 \n1985). In common environment conditions, first-year pine seedlings from colder areas 209 \ngenerally set their terminal buds and become frost hardy earlier than the ones from 210 \nwarmer conditions (e.g. Hurme et al., 1997). Also, when seedlings from different parts of 211 \nEurope were grown under photoperiods typical of 50\u00b0 latitude, seedlings from northern 212 \nregions set buds earlier compared to seedlings from more southern locations (Oleksyn et 213 \nal., 1992). The same pattern has also been found in height growth cessation of older trees 214 \n(Oleksyn et al., 2001; Repo et al., 2000).  In Sweden, provenance transfers from north to 215 \nsouth resulted in increased survival, but transferred provenances grew less than local ones 216 \ndue to phenological differences (Eriksson et al., 1980; Persson and St\u00e5hl, 1990). On the 217 \nother hand, northward transfers increased mortality. Commonly, trees from sites 218 \nexperiencing harsher \u2013 e.g. drier or  colder - conditions grow more slowly than those 219 \noriginating from milder environments, but they are also more tolerant of stress (Howe et 220 \nal., 2003). Phenotypic divergence among populations is generally thought to be due to 221 \ndifferentiation at multiple underlying genes driven by diversifying selection (for reviews 222 \non the genetic basis of complex trait variation in trees, see Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u00ednez et al., 223 \n 10 \n2006; Howe et al., 2003; Neale and Ingvarsson, 2008; Savolainen et al., 2007), but so far 224 \ncandidate gene studies in trees have revealed more about past demographic processes than 225 \nabout effects of selection (see  Lascoux et al., 2008). However, additional factors can also 226 \ncontribute: in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) it appears that maternal effects, e.g. 227 \ndifferences due to environmental conditions during seed development, can greatly 228 \ninfluence trait variation (Johnsen et al., 2005; Skr\u00f8ppa, 1994; Skr\u00f8ppa et al., 1994), but in 229 \nScots pine such effects seem much smaller (Ruotsalainen et al., 1995).  230 \n 231 \nFor maintenance of natural patterns of adaptive variation, the safest option is usually to 232 \nuse local seed material or seeds from an environment that matches conditions at the 233 \nplanting site (Aitken et al., 2008; McKay et al., 2005). Using genotypes from other 234 \nlocations might negatively affect the local population due to outbreeding depression 235 \n(hybridization among excessively diverged populations) leading to decreased fitness 236 \n(Frankham et al., 2002). The definition of \u201clocal\u201d depends on the species: in Douglas-fir 237 \n(Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), genetic differentiation can occur at 100-200 238 \nmetres (Campbell, 1979), while populations of western white pine (Pinus monticola 239 \nDougl.) seem genetically similar across a wide range covering 10\u00b0 in both latitude and 240 \nlongitude (Rehfeldt et al., 1984). Relatively short transfers can actually be beneficial for 241 \ngrowth and survival: some conifer populations on the northern edge of the species 242 \ndistributions have been found to perform better if transferred southward of their origin 243 \n(e.g. Savolainen et al., 2007), while in other species a similar response can be seen in 244 \ntransfers further north (Carter, 1996).  245 \n 246 \nIs Scots pine locally adapted in Scotland?  247 \n 248 \n 11 \nThe current abundance of pinewood in Scotland is only a small fraction of what it used to 249 \nbe, and potentially the exploitation of the resources could have interfered with local 250 \nadaptation by randomly removing best-adapted trees. . However, the previous molecular 251 \nmarker studies based on monoterpenes (Forrest, 1980; Forrest, 1982) and allozymes 252 \n(Kinloch et al., 1986) and recent work on nucleotide variation in candidate genes 253 \n(Wachowiak et al., 2010) show that even in relict populations, levels of molecular 254 \nvariation are similar to those observed in the continuous part of the species\u201f range and, as 255 \nis usual in the case of long-lived, randomly mating forest trees with effective gene flow by 256 \npollen (Hamrick et al., 1992), almost all of the variation was found within populations. In 257 \ntheory, colonization events (such as postglacial migration) are expected to decrease 258 \ngenetic variation through bottlenecks, but the life history characteristics of trees 259 \n(longevity, multiple age and size classes, overlapping generations and late reproduction) 260 \nseem to buffer against these effects (Austerlitz et al., 2000). For example, due to their 261 \npostglacial colonisation history northern Fennoscandian Scots pine populations are much 262 \nmore recently established than those from Central Europe (Willis et al., 1998), but despite 263 \ntheir different histories the two parts of the range have very similar levels of nucleotide 264 \nvariation at candidate genes (Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi et al., 2007). Some quantitative traits have been 265 \nfound to have less adaptive variation towards the northern range edges, but this pattern is 266 \nnot seen in all traits, and differences could be caused  by varying selection pressure 267 \n(Notivol et al., 2007). In Scottish populations, low marker divergence among populations 268 \nsuggests that gene flow among sites has, at least historically, been sufficient to 269 \nhomogenise genetic variation across populations (Kinloch et al., 1986). Also, when 270 \ncomparing differentiation at cpDNA markers between Scotland and eight European 271 \nmainland populations, only around 1.5 % of the variation was found between populations, 272 \nindicating high levels of gene flow (Provan et al., 1998). Within Scotland, 3.2% of the 273 \n 12 \nvariation was among populations. Glen Falloch, a relict population consisting of less than 274 \n100 trees, had the lowest diversity.  Despite drastic changes in the abundance of Scots 275 \npine in Scotland, it seems that the level of neutral molecular variation remains high, with 276 \nthe majority of this variation being found mainly within populations.   277 \n 278 \nDespite the relatively small area covered by pinewoods in Scotland, the environmental 279 \nconditions among them vary tremendously, providing potential for different selection 280 \npressures to lead to local adaptation. Furthermore, Scotland\u201fs populations form a unique 281 \npart of the species\u201f range due to its oceanic climate; only in western parts of Norway do 282 \nScots pine woodlands occur in similar environments (\u00d8yen et al., 2006). To summarise 283 \nclimatic variation among Scottish native pinewood sites, we extracted data for all 84 284 \npinewoods from the gridded (5 \u00d7 5 km) long-term average (1961-1990) UK Met Office 285 \ndata. Details on the climate data generation can be found elsewhere (Perry and Hollis, 286 \n2005). The climate data indicate that some western populations in Scotland experience an 287 \nannual rainfall of close to 3,000 mm compared to only about 700 mm in the eastern parts. 288 \nThe length of the growing season (the number of days with average temperature above 289 \n+5\u00b0C) varies from about 100 in some eastern pinewoods to 300 days near the west coast. 290 \nTo study whether climatically similar pinewoods were found within each seed zone, we 291 \nperformed a principal component analysis (PCA) to transform the seven variables into 292 \ntwo components (figure 2, table 1). The data suggest that different pinewood sites within 293 \nseed zones do not form climatically uniform clusters, which indicates that climatic 294 \nvariation within one zone can be large. For example, the North West seed zone covers 295 \nareas with growing season lengths varying from about 130 to almost 300 days (table 2). 296 \nBecause of this extensive within-zone variation and considering for instance the effects of 297 \nprovenance transfers along latitudinal gradients in Sweden (Persson and St\u00e5hl, 1990), it is 298 \n 13 \npossible that current guidance results in seedlings being planted at non-optimal sites. 299 \nHowever, it should be kept in mind that this data was generated by interpolation from data 300 \nfrom weather stations which are not equally distributed across the country, and the 301 \nprecision of models for different variables varies (Perry and Hollis, 2005). In addition to 302 \nclimate, there is also variation in soil types; generally pine prefers freely-draining podzol 303 \nand ironpan soils with relatively low nutrient levels, but it is also found in brown earths, 304 \ngleys and peats (Mason et al., 2004). In wet conditions, poor drainage can lead to poor 305 \ngrowth and water-logging.  306 \n 307 \n[Table 1, Table 2, Figure 2] 308 \n 309 \nSome evidence of local adaptation in the native pinewoods exists, but the data currently 310 \navailable is not extensive. Old provenance experiments set up by the Forestry 311 \nCommission in Scotland starting in the 1920s show that populations from the mainland of 312 \nEurope generally perform worse than Scottish material (Lines and Mitchell, 1965). Within 313 \nScotland, trees transferred from continental to strongly oceanic areas usually perform 314 \nworse than local populations, possibly due to pathogen stress (Mason et al., 2004). Perks 315 \nand McKay (1997) found significant differences in root frost hardiness and growth in 316 \nseedlings from four provenances; for instance, seedlings from Loch Maree, located in the 317 \nwest close to the Atlantic, had poorer height growth and slower development of frost 318 \nhardiness than other provenances. The only study where genetic parameters of adaptive 319 \nvariation were estimated was by Perks and Ennos (1999) who also sampled four 320 \nprovenances, each represented by 100 open-pollinated progeny (ten from each of ten 321 \nmother trees). Seedlings were grown at one site and measured at seven years of age. 322 \nSignificant differentiation among populations was found in diameter, height and bud 323 \n 14 \nburst. Adaptive variation was found in all of the measured characters, demonstrating the 324 \npresence of genetic variation for adaptively important traits, but due to the sample size, 325 \nestimates on the amount of adaptive variation are not precise. Also, while it was possible 326 \nto show clear differentiation among populations in the traits considered, geographic 327 \ncoverage was too limited to offer a full picture of patterns of adaptive variation and the 328 \nstudy did not attempt to link observed trends to variation in climatic variables.  329 \n 330 \nIdeally, in Scotland, the seed transfer guidelines for Scots pine should be based on 331 \nclimatic and environmental characterisation of the remnant pinewoods and provenance 332 \ntrials, ideally replicated in different environments. Considering the environmental 333 \nvariation that exists within Scotland, differentiation in traits of adaptive importance such 334 \nas phenology, stress tolerance, and growth seems likely. For the maintenance of healthy 335 \npinewoods in Scotland and to update existing seed transfer guidelines, it is essential to 336 \nstudy adaptive variation in a number of traits across the whole Scottish range.  337 \n 338 \nMaintenance of variation in pinewoods 339 \n 340 \nThe current seed zones of Scots pine are meant to protect the \u201cgenetic integrity\u201d of local 341 \npopulations. However, the definition of genetic integrity remains unclear. While 342 \nmaternally-inherited mtDNA variation might show differentiation among some of the 343 \npinewoods (Sinclair et al., 1998), this does not mean that populations containing the 344 \ndiverged mtDNA lineages are unconnected. In forest trees, the fact that most of the 345 \nvariation measured with neutral molecular markers occurs within populations can be 346 \nattributed to efficient pollen-mediated gene flow (Hamrick et al., 1992). Pollen flow can 347 \neffectively mix the gene pools of populations even if they are under diversifying selection. 348 \n 15 \nHowever, although a significant proportion of pollen can originate from sites located even 349 \na few dozen kilometres away, the great majority of fertilizing pollen usually comes from 350 \ntrees located within the same stand as the mother tree (e.g. Smouse and Sork, 2004). 351 \nNonetheless, such mixing can contribute to the maintenance of variation in adaptive traits 352 \n(Barton, 1999; Slatkin, 1978) which in turn can facilitate adaptation to changing 353 \nconditions, as potentially beneficial alleles are introduced to the gene pool of the 354 \npopulation. Yeaman and Jarvis (2006) studied effects of environmental heterogeneity on 355 \nvariation in height growth in 142 populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas 356 \nex. Loudon) and found that variability among the populations in drought occurrence, 357 \nannual precipitation and temperature explained 7-20% of the variation in height growth. 358 \nDue to influx of genetic variation from other populations gene flow can also counteract 359 \nadaptation, especially in peripheral populations (Garcia-Ramos and Kirkpatrick, 1997). It 360 \nis unlikely that the native pinewoods represent independently evolving units. Previous 361 \nstudies on Scottish pinewoods show low levels of population differentiation (Kinloch et 362 \nal., 1986; Provan et al., 1998), although the gene flow estimates are indirect and may not 363 \nreflect current landscape-level processes (Smouse and Sork, 2004; Sork et al., 1999).  364 \n 365 \nOngoing climate change is affecting forests all over the world, and changes in 366 \ntemperature, rainfall and frequency of extreme weather events are expected (e.g. IPCC, 367 \n2007). In Scotland, models predict warmer summers and milder winters, with changes in 368 \nthe distribution of rainfall (Ray, 2008). In the east, summers are predicted to become 369 \ndrier, possibly leading to drought, while winters may become wetter, also a problem if it 370 \nleads to water-logging and anaerobic conditions in soils. Warmer conditions may help 371 \npests and pathogens spread to new areas. For example, the northward spread of the pine 372 \nprocessionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa Dennis and Schiff) in Italy has been 373 \n 16 \nattributed to increasing winter temperatures (Battisti et al., 2005), and since the late 374 \n1990s, the occurrence of red needle blight, a fungal disease infecting a wide range of 375 \nPinus species, has increased in the UK with first outbreaks occurring in Scotland in 2002 376 \n(Brown et al., 2003). Changes in climate can lead to situations where environments are no 377 \nlonger optimal for the populations growing in them. Trees have experienced warming 378 \nconditions before, following the retreat of continental ice at the end of the ice age (e.g. 379 \nDavis and Shaw, 2001). In current conditions the problem for trees is likely to be the rate 380 \nof change which is projected to be faster than that following the latest ice age. After the 381 \nlast glaciation, European trees migrated at average speeds of around 100-700 metres per 382 \nyear, depending on the species (Brewer et al., 2002; Magri et al., 2006). According to 383 \nMalcolm and Markham (2002), trees will have to be able to migrate at a rate of over 1,000 384 \nm per year to be able to keep pace with human-induced change. This time, however, trees 385 \nface environments already occupied by other species.  386 \n 387 \nFor a change in fitness of the population, selection must work on the variation present in 388 \nthe population (Falconer and Mackay, 1996). Genetic variation in phenotypic traits can be 389 \nassessed by growing seedlings in a common environment in which environmental 390 \nvariation is kept to a minimum (e.g. White et al., 2007). Only variation that can be passed 391 \non to the next generation has evolutionary significance; therefore, estimating levels of 392 \nsuch variation requires observations based on samples of a known family structure (e.g. 393 \nopen-pollinated half-sib families). In the majority of the forest trees studied, populations 394 \ngenerally maintain high levels of adaptive variation (Aitken et al., 2008; Howe et al., 395 \n2003; Savolainen et al., 2007), even in range-edge populations under extreme conditions 396 \n(Notivol et al., 2007; Savolainen et al., 2004). In traits with high levels of such variation, 397 \nthe change in the phenotypic mean in response to new selection pressures can be rapid 398 \n 17 \n(Falconer and Mackay, 1996). However, the life history characteristics of trees can slow 399 \ndown rates of adaptation: they are long-lived, have long generation times and, due to 400 \nphenotypic plasticity, can continue to grow and reproduce even in changed environments 401 \n(Hamrick, 2004; M\u00e1ty\u00e1s, 1996; Savolainen et al., 2004; Savolainen et al., 2007). For 402 \nexample, Swedish provenance trials suggest that climate-related mortality in Scots pine 403 \noccurs mainly in the early stages (first 20 years) of a tree\u201fs life cycle (Persson and St\u00e5hl, 404 \n1990). In addition, if grazing pressure prevents natural regeneration, the adaptive variation 405 \npresent in seedlings is lost.  406 \n 407 \nDue to within-species genetic differentiation adaptive responses may vary among 408 \npopulations from different parts of the range. According to Rehfeldt et al. (2002), the 409 \nimmediate response to a warming climate will be positive in Scots pine populations 410 \ngrowing in harsh (suboptimal) conditions, e.g. northern parts of Europe, while populations 411 \nin mild (optimal) environments, e.g. southern Europe, will suffer. Using simulations, 412 \nSavolainen et al. (2004) concluded that while Finnish Scots pine populations have 413 \npotential to adapt in timing of bud set and frost hardiness, their response will be delayed 414 \nand will lag behind the moving optimum, partly because of the already established trees 415 \ngrowing at the site.Increased mortality could facilitate adaptation by creating open spaces 416 \nfor regeneration (Kuparinen et al., 2010). Specific forest management practices have also 417 \nbeen suggested as methods for enhancing adaptation; for instance, seedlings could be 418 \ntransferred according to the predicted climate (St. Clair and Howe, 2007), or the interval 419 \nbetween recruitment events could be shortened (Kramer et al., 2008).  420 \n 421 \nBefore specific provenances can be chosen for future climate, data on the effects of tree 422 \ntransfers between variable sites and on variation of adaptively important traits is needed. 423 \n 18 \nWith such data in hand, models may be developed to test responses to specified variables, 424 \nalthough making predictions will remain challenging. Not only is adaptation a complex 425 \nprocess involving a number of traits simultaneously, but environmental change may also 426 \ninvolve changes in the structure of stands, stress frequency, growth rates and competition 427 \n(Richardson et al., 2007), and it is impossible to include all possible variables at the same 428 \ntime. Current models have yet to combine genetics and ecology effectively, for example 429 \nmodels based on niche concepts often fail to take into account the possibility of 430 \nadaptation, while genetic models deal inadequately with ecology. There is a pressing 431 \nneed, for climate change mitigation, for the development of new, landscape-scale models 432 \nthat integrate these fields. 433 \n 434 \nStudies on adaptive variation would also benefit from an understanding of current patterns 435 \nof genetic connectivity among forest fragments. For example, if only local material is 436 \nused for planting and gene flow is limited, local genetic \u201cintegrity\u201d of small populations 437 \nwill be maintained, but the population might become vulnerable to changing conditions 438 \ndue to insufficient adaptive variation for natural selection to operate on. In the case of 439 \nisolated populations, variation could be introduced by bringing seedlings from other 440 \nlocations; however, if gene flow occurs naturally and if natural regeneration occurs, such 441 \npractices might be unnecessary. Due to differences in the sizes of the native pinewoods 442 \n(from less than one to over 2,000 ha), there might also be variation in the patterns of 443 \nmating system. In small populations, random drift becomes a powerful force shaping 444 \nallele frequencies, and along with inbreeding, this can lead to lower fitness as detrimental 445 \nalleles increase in frequency (Frankham et al., 2002). Like other pines, Scots pine is 446 \nmainly outcrossing (Muona and Harju, 1989), i.e. matings usually occur between 447 \nunrelated trees, but self-pollination, the most severe form of inbreeding,  is also possible 448 \n 19 \ndue to the lack of a genetic system preventing self-fertilization (Sarvas, 1962). Normally, 449 \nselfed embryos are aborted early in their development due to early inbreeding depression. 450 \nHowever, in stands with limited numbers of trees, bi-parental inbreeding (mating between 451 \nrelatives) is a potential risk. Despite efficient gene flow, inbreeding might become a 452 \nsignificant factor when isolation is extreme. In Scots pine, gene flow and mating system 453 \nhave been studied in e.g. Spanish populations occurring in isolated stands in mountainous 454 \nregions. Although the proportions of self-pollinationwere eight times larger (25% vs. 3%) 455 \nin a population of 36 trees spread across a 15-ha area compared to that of larger 456 \npopulations covering thousands of hectares (Robledo-Arnuncio et al., 2004), the rates 457 \nwere nevertheless low when the degree of isolation of the trees is taken into account. In 458 \nthe small population, 4.3 % of the pollen originated from other populations, the closest 459 \none being located 30 km away  (Robledo-Arnuncio and Gil, 2005). K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen et al. 460 \n(1996) documented variation in levels of inbreeding depression within larger populations 461 \nin Finland: outcrossing rates in northern populations were somewhat lower than in the 462 \nsouth, but inbreeding depression was weaker in the north, possibly due to selection having 463 \nalready removed detrimental recessive alleles exposed by inbreeding. Understanding the 464 \nmating system is also beneficial for  studies on adaptive variation in phenotype, as 465 \ndepartures from the assumed family structure can lead to biased estimates of adaptively 466 \nsignificant genetic variation (Namkoong, 1966; Squillace, 1974). 467 \n 468 \nConclusions 469 \n 470 \nDue to its economic and biological significance across two continents, Scots pine is one 471 \nof the most thoroughly studied forest tree species in the world, and its biology has been 472 \nstudied from DNA to the whole ecosystem level. Native remnant pinewoods of Scotland 473 \n 20 \nrepresent a distinct part of the distribution because of their proximity to the Atlantic 474 \nOcean, highly variable climate conditions and the 500 km distance to the closest 475 \ncontinental populations. Scots pine\u201fs current coverage in Scotland is only a fraction of 476 \nwhat it used to be, but there are plans to expand old and plant new native woodlands. . If 477 \nlocal adaptation has occurred and provided that other management practices (e.g. 478 \ncultivation and deer management) support successful regeneration, modifications to 479 \nexisting seed transfer guidelines could improve the effectiveness of  re-plantation efforts 480 \nby minimising seedling mortality due to maladapted stock and the consequent ecological, 481 \neconomic and strategic effects. Current transfer rules are based primarily on molecular 482 \nvariation that does not reflect the likely pattern of environmental adaptation across 483 \nScotland. To update the existing management guidelines, further research is 484 \nrecommended, with a particular focus on the following: 485 \n 486 \n1. Rangewide progeny trials are needed to characterise general trends of adaptive 487 \nvariation in traits such as phenology, growth, and stress tolerance in relation to the 488 \nenvironment. Such data can also reveal whether plantations have diluted local 489 \nadaptation in native pinewoods.  490 \n2. Effects of provenance transfers along climatic gradients can be obtained by 491 \nreplicating trials at multiple environmentally diverse sites across Scotland. In such 492 \na design, the performance of local trees can also be compared to that of trees from 493 \nmore distant sources.   494 \n3. Neutral genetic markers should be used to assess other types of natural processes 495 \noccurring in populations, such as effects of population fragmentation, mating 496 \nsystem variation and current gene flow dynamics.  497 \n 21 \n4. Potential role of pollen contamination can be assessed by e.g. observing 498 \nsynchronisation of reproductive events between plantations and nearby native 499 \nwoodlands.   500 \n 501 \n502 \n 22 \nFunding 503 \n 504 \nThis work was supported by Scottish Forestry Trust (MJS\u201f PhD studentship), NERC and 505 \nthe EU-funded Network of Excellence EVOLTREE (FP6, contract #016322; WW\u201fs  506 \nmobility grant under IA4 - Human resource exchange).  507 \n 508 \nAcknowledgments 509 \n 510 \nThe authors wish to thank UK Met Office for allowing the use of their climate data,  Chris 511 \nQuine, Editor Gary Kerr and an anonymous reviewer for comments that improved the 512 \nmanuscript.  513 \n 514 \n515 \n 23 \nReferences 516 \n 517 \nAitken SN, Yeaman S, Holliday JA, Wang T, Curtis-McLane S.
