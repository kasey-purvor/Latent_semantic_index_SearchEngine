We provide a discussion of sources\nof uncertainty and risk-based tools could be linked with decision-making approaches\nto inform adaptation plans that are robust to climate change.\n1 Introduction\nMany of the world\u2019s cities are hotspots of risk from extreme weather events (e.g.\nMunich Re 2004) and levels of risk in many cities are likely to grow due to a\ncombination of population growth and development and rising intensities of extreme\nweather events. For example, Hanson et al. (2011, in this issue) demonstrate high\npopulation and economic exposure to storm surge risks in many of the world\u2019s largest\nand fastest growing cities. These are also areas where adaptation can have significant\nbenefits. Managing risks from extremes will be a crucial component of adaptation\nplanning.\nA challenge in planning adaptation relates to the quantification of the risks from\nextreme weather events and the benefits of different adaptation measures. This study\npresents an approach to quantifying city-scale risks that is based on Hallegatte et al.\n(2011a, in this issue); here it draws on the principles of catastrophe risk modelling\ncommonly used in the developed world but simplified for application for a more data\nsparse region and coupled with downscaled climate model projections. This approach\nis applied to quantifying future flood risk in the city of Mumbai, India. Mumbai is\nthe main commercial and financial centre of India, generating about 5% of India\u2019s\ngross domestic product (GDP). The study also aims to demonstrate the importance\nof capturing the indirect costs of disasters in risk and adaptation assessments.\nThe study follows the broad stages of an \u2018impacts-based\u2019 adaptation assessment\n(Carter et al. 2007): firstly, characterising current levels of vulnerability and potential\nfuture sensitivities (Section 2); secondly, quantifying relevant risks (Sections 3 and 4);\nand thirdly, identifying adaptation options and evaluating their benefits (Section 5).\nThis study does not complete the adaptation assessment, it only aims to demonstrate\nvarious elements; for example, it is limited in that it explores one (\u2018upper-bound\u2019)\nclimate scenario and it looks at a limited set of adaptation options (and only benefits,\nnot costs). It also does not enter the next stage of applying decision methods and\nforming strategies; though in Section 6 we provide a brief discussion of our approach\nin this context. We note that this study is part of an ongoing body of research\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 141\nsponsored by the OECD; forthcoming research over the next year will expand on\nthis study with additional research from a number of local partners.\n2 Mumbai: current vulnerability to flooding and future sensitivities\nA logical first stage of any adaptation assessment is to understand levels of current\nvulnerability to weather. Mumbai is prone to flooding and witnesses severe disrup-\ntions almost annually; for example, between 2004 and 2007, Mumbai experienced\nflooding each summer. But in July 2005, the city experienced the worst flooding in\nits recorded history, resulting in damages estimated at around $1.7 billions USD and\naround 500 fatalities (GoM 2005). Across Northwest India, the flooding crippled an\narea of over 35,500 km2, affecting 20 million people and causing economic damages\nof around $3\u20135 billions US (Swiss Re 2006; Munich Re 2006). Figure 1 shows a map of\nthe flood extent across the City and Suburban districts of Mumbai (which collectively\nFig. 1 Digitized flood extent map for the 2005 event (based on Gupta 2007), showing the city wards\nand the location of the Mumbai City and Suburban Districts\n142 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nform the Greater Mumbai region) digitalised from Gupta (2007); around 20% of the\narea was affected, with flood waters to a depth of 0.5 to 1.5 m in low-lying areas.\nThe root cause of Mumbai\u2019s susceptibility to flooding is its geography, both natural\nand manmade (Duryog Nivaran 2005). Firstly, the city\u2019s location leaves it exposed\nto heavy rainfall during the summer; typically, 50% of the rainfall during the two\nwettest months, July and August, falls in just two or three events (Jenamani 2006).\nThis situation is aggravated by the manmade geography; large areas of the land are\nreclaimed and are situated only just above sea level and below the high-tide level.\nThis inhibits natural runoff of surface water and the complicated network of drains,\nrivers, creeks and ponds drain directly in the sea, meaning that during high tides, sea\nwater can enter the system preventing drainage and in extreme cases, leading to salt\nwater deluge. This occurred during the July 2005 event; a massive inundation of the\ndrainage systems caused as almost 1000 mm of rainfall fell on the city in 24 h was\ncombined with a failure of the system as sea water entered during high tide.\nFuture levels of flood risk are also potentially sensitivity to climate change and\nother drivers of risk. Urbanisation has been an important driver of increased flood\nrisk in the city. For example, it is estimated that urbanisation alone has contributed to\na two or three fold increase in runoff in the city. The drainage systems of the city are\nnow inadequate to cope with heavy rainfall and are impeded by urban encroachment\nand channel blockages. Continued rapid urbanisation, particularly in the absence\nof effective spatial planning and improved drainage systems, is likely to lead to an\nincrease in flood risk in Mumbai.\nOver the coming decades, the pressures of urbanisation may be aggravated\nby manmade climate change. Like many other areas, the Northwest of India has\nobserved a statistically significant warming of annual mean surface air temperatures\nover the past century (IPCC 2007, Figure 3.9). While no statistically significant trend\nin annual rainfall has been observed in the past three decades (IPCC 2007, e.g. Figure\n3.13), there are signs of an increased contribution to annual rainfall from very wet\ndays (Alexander et al. 2006). In the future, an increase in rainfall volume and\/or\nintensity could increase the risk of severe flooding. Global climate models (GCMs)\ngive a divergent picture of how precipitation will change in Northwest India over\nthis century. For example, the ensemble mean of the GCM projections assessed in\nIPCC (2007) suggests a small average increase in the summer precipitation (roughly\n5% of 1990 levels by the 2090s), however this small average masks large positive\nand negative changes projected by individual models. The strong uncertainty in this\nregion is driven by the inability of the current generation of GCMs to adequately\nrepresent the detailed topography of South Asia and the cloud microphysics involved\nin tropical convective processes.\n3 Quantifying current and future flood risk in Mumbai\nThe risk quantification approach used in this study follows a standard catastrophe\nrisk modelling framework, which combines estimates of hazard, exposure and vul-\nnerability (Grossi and Kunreuther 2005). This framework provides an estimate of\nthe direct economic damages and population exposed to flood events with different\nprobabilities of occurrence. In this study, probabilities are represented as return\nperiods of events, i.e. a 1 in 200 year return period (denoted yr RP) event has a\n0.005% annual probability of occurrence. To this framework we add an additional\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 143\ncomponent (Section 4) that estimates the indirect damages from flood events. To\ninform adaptation decision-making it is also important to consider fatalities or\ninjuries, but this is beyond the scope of this study. In this analysis, we explore only the\neffect of changes in rainfall on levels of risk. Without effective adaptation, continued\nrapid urbanisation and sea level rise would combine with rainfall changes to further\nincrease levels of risk.\n3.1 Hazard quantification\nThis sub-section describes the approach to quantify the current and future frequen-\ncies of heavy rainfall events for Mumbai and the generation of simulated flood\nfootprints. There are two key challenges in quantifying flood hazard: the short length\nof available rainfall records for the city and the inadequacies of climate models in\nprojecting changes in rainfall at a city-scale (IPCC 2007).\nRainfall observations are taken from the Santa Cruz Indian Meteorological\nDepartment (IMD) station located in the Mumbai Suburban District (closest to\nthe most extreme flooding). This 30-year record is extended empirically using the\nWXGEN weather generator (Williams et al. 1985; Sharpley and Williams 1990a, b;\nWallis and Griffiths 1995) to create a 200-year simulated record. The simulation\nis based on six key statistical characteristics of the timeseries analysed from the\nhistorical data.1 A further challenge highlighted by the analysis is that the rainfall\nthat led to the 2005 flooding far exceeded any daily amount measured since records\nbegan; in the 24 h starting at 8:30am on 26th July 2005, 944 mm of rainfall was\nmeasured at Santa Cruz. Including such an outlier in an analysis based on a short\nrainfall timeseries has the potential to skew the findings of the study. For this reason,\ntwo simulated time series were constructed, one including the July 2005 event in\nthe statistical analysis (denoted Hist_SZ_I) and one disregarding it (Hist_SZ_X).\nReturn periods of daily maximum rainfall for Santa Cruz are estimated by fitting\na simple lognormal distribution to the 200-year time series (Fig. 2). The analysis\nsuggests that the event that led to the 2005 flooding had a return period of at least\naround 150 years, and possibly much greater than 200 years. It is not possible to\npinpoint the frequency with greater accuracy given the short-length of the available\nrainfall record. We assume that the return period of a 2005-like event will lie\nbetween our two estimates (from Hist_SZ_X and Hist_SZ_I); that is, around 1 in 200\nyears.\nFuture precipitation projections for the 2080s are taken from the PRECIS model\n(Jones et al. 2004); a high resolution regional climate model based on HadCM3. The\n2080s timescale is selected as this is relevant to many long-term infrastructure and\nbuilding decisions being taken today. PRECIS is selected as Kumar et al. (2006)\nnotes that only the HadCM3 and CSIRO models are able to adequately represent\npresent-day rainfall extremes in western India and PRECIS is shown to provide a\ngood representation of the spatial patterns of relevant seasonal rainfall and extremes.\nHowever, the HadCM3 seasonal mean rainfall projections are at the upper bound of\nestimates across the IPCC model ensemble (IPCC 2007); in fact, only slightly over\nhalf of the 21 models assessed project an increase in precipitation over Northwest\n1The average rainfall, standard deviation, skew coefficient, probability of wet day followed by dry\nday, probability of wet day followed by wet day and the number of rainy days.\n144 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nFig. 2 Estimates of the return\nperiod of daily maximum\nrainfall at Santa Cruz\nhistorically and in the 2080s\n(under a high-end scenario).\nFurther details on each\nestimate shown are given in\nthe text, where (1) 2080s\nProjection is denoted\nA2_SZ_X; (2) Historical,\nincluding 2005 is denoted\nHist_SZ_I; and (3) Historical,\nexcluding 2005 is denoted\nHist_SZ_X.

The model is driven with the A2 SRES emissions scenario (Nakicenovic et al.\n2000). Under this scenario, PRECIS projects a 3.6\u25e6C increase in mean temperatures\na 6.5% increase in seasonal mean rainfall across India by the 2080s. Given the\nuncertainties in climate, a full adaptation assessment would explore the implications\nof a range of model-based climate scenarios; this is beyond the scope of this study.\nThe findings of this study alone could be considered indicative of an upper-end\nestimate of possible future risks; we would not consider this a \u2018worst-case\u2019 estimate as\nit is not clear that the range of current climate model projections fully represent the\nrange of uncertainties. Our interpretation is that given current understanding, this is\none of a set of equally probable scenarios.\nThe PRECIS results are first downscaled and extended using WXGEN to create\na 200-year rainfall timeseries comparable to the simulated records for the Santa\nCruz station. The downscaling involves mapping the change in the statistical char-\nacteristics of rainfall between the Baseline (1961\u20131990) and 2080s Projected (2071\u2013\n2100) precipitation in the PRECIS model for the relevant grid box. These statistical\ncharacteristics are the same six characteristics used to drive WXGEN. These changes\nare then mapped as linear multipliers onto the statistical characteristics analysed at\nSanta Cruz (Hist_SZ_X) to estimate future statistical characteristics at the location.\nThe final step is to run WXGEN with these \u2018future characteristics\u2019 to generate\nthe new 2080s time series (A2_SZ_X). This procedure assumes that the statistical\nrelationships between the large-scale (the PRECIS baseline) and small-scale (Santa\nCruz) timeseries remain unchanged such that it is appropriate to map \u2018future\u2019\nstatistical characteristics between each. This assumption is untested and therefore\nintroduces uncertainty into the findings.\nFigure 2 demonstrates that by the 2080s, the intensity of extreme rainfall could\nbe increased at all return periods. The increase is particularly strong for the shorter\nreturn period (more frequent) events. For example, under this scenario, the intensity\nof a 2\u20135 year return period event has close to doubled. The analysis suggests that\nthe return period of an event of July 2005 scale is reduced to around 1-in-90 years\n\u0002Fig. 3 a Fifty-year return period flood maps for present day (left) and 2080s (right). b One-hundred-\nyear return period flood maps for present day (left) and 2080s (right). c Two-hundred-year return\nperiod flood maps for present day (left) and 2080s (right)\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 145\n146 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nin 2080 under a SRES A2 scenario. Even though this analysis has several limitations\nand is based on only one climate model, this result shows a high potential sensitivity\nof flood risk to climate change and provides a justification for further investigation.\nGiven that urban flooding in Mumbai is mainly pluvial, we would expect an\nincrease in the frequency of extreme rainfall to translate into an increase in flood\nhazard (all else being equal). Rivers in Mumbai tend to act as open drains during\nextreme rainfall events, carrying excess surface water to the sea and major flooding\ncan occur when the rainfall rates exceeds the drainage capacity of these rivers. Here,\nwe use an urban flood model to simulate the relationship between rainfall and flood\nextents. There are three main river basins in the study area; here, we focus on\nMithi River Basin, where some of the greatest flood damages occurred in 2005, and\nextrapolate to city-scale in later sections. The Mithi basin is directly fed by the rainfall\nobserved at the Santa Cruz station. The modelling approach uses the Storm Water\nManagement Model (SWMM), modified to represent the Mithi Basin (for details,\nsee Appendix A), to generate hypothetical flood footprints which correspond to the\n2005 event and for the simulated rainfall events with the return periods of 50, 100 and\n200 years, for today (Hist_SZ_X) and in the 2080s (A2_SZ_X). Figure 3 shows the\nestimated flood extents and depths for these simulated events. With climate change,\nwe see an extension of the area flooded at each return period and an increase in flood\ndepth. A limitation of this analysis is that it does not take into account the potential\neffect of sea level rise in reducing the effectiveness of the drainage systems.\nApplied to the 2005 flood event, we find that the SWMM model underestimates\nthe observed flood extent by around 20%, likely due to the low resolution of the\nelevation data used. This relationship can be used to calibrate the simulated return-\nperiod flood footprints. Table 1 shows the uncalibrated area of the Mithi Basin\nflooded for each simulated event.\n3.2 Exposure mapping\nAn exposure map shows the spatial distribution of all the people or properties in\nthe study area. This is compared with the flood footprint to estimate the \u2018affected\nexposure\u2019. We assume an unchanged city (i.e. population and properties at their mid-\n2000s values). Population and growth factors can be applied to this to estimate future\nexposure.\nA digitalised population map was developed from publicly available 2001 census\ndata (MCGM 2008). The data, at ward-level, was distributed evenly over a 100 m\ngrid. The distribution of residential, commercial and industrial property types was\nderived by analysing observations from the IRS LISS III satellite (Indian Remote\nSensing Satellite, Linear Image Self Scanning III) fused with a panchromatic image\nTable 1 Comparison of (uncalibrated) flood extent areas under different simulated rainfall scenarios\n(A2_SZ_X) for the Mithi Basin generated by the SWMM model\nSimulated event ID Today 2080s\n2005 event 16 \u2013\n50 years RP event 12 14\n100 years RP Event 12 16\n200 years RP Event 12 17\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 147\nat a resolution of 10 m. Six exposure types were defined: two residential (low\ndensity and high density), three commercial (low-rise retail and offices, high-rise\noffice blocks and skyscrapers) and one industrial. The total insured values (TIVs) of\nthese properties were based on the RMS India Earthquake Model\u00ae (INEQ), which\nincorporates proprietary insurance data. This data is distributed onto the 100 m grid\naccording to the exposure types. Across the two study districts, we estimated a TIV\nof $480 million USD, $520 million USD and $1,960 million USD for the residential,\ncommercial and industrial exposures, respectively. The TIV can be converted to a\ntotal value if the insurance penetration is known. Here, the insurance penetration\nis assumed to be roughly around 8% for residential properties, 14% for commercial\nproperties and 17% for industrial properties, based on RMS proprietary data. Note\nthat these estimates have a high uncertainty and that the exposure estimates are\nhighly sensitive to this quantity.\nCombining the exposure maps with the observed flood footprint from the 2005\nflooding (Fig. 1), it is possible to calculate the \u2018affected exposure\u2019 across Greater\nMumbai in 2005 (Table 2). This demonstrates, for example, that 35% of the resident\npopulation lived in areas directed affected by the flooding.\nTable 3 uses the same methodology but with the simulated flood footprints for\nthe Mithi River Basin (Fig. 3), giving estimates of the affected exposure at different\nreturn periods in that area of the city.\nWe can extrapolate from these Mithi affected exposure estimates to create\n\u2018ballpark\u2019 estimates of the affected exposure across the whole of the Greater Mumbai\narea (Table 4), using the relationship between the observed affected exposure across\nthese districts for July 2005 (from Table 2) and the simulated affected exposure in\nthe Mithi Basin (from Table 3). The uncertainty introduced by this extrapolation\nis large, for example, it assumes that the relationship between Mithi and Mumbai\nflooding remains the same for all flood events.\n3.3 Estimating vulnerability\nVulnerability here refers to the damage cost to a property expected for a given level\nof water depth. This is expressed in terms of the mean damage ratio; that is, the\nmonetary damage as a proportion of the total value of affected property. Usually in\nrisk modelling, vulnerability is defined by a set of \u2018damage curves\u2019. However, because\nof the lack of reliable data on building vulnerability in Mumbai, and to provide\npreliminary estimates, we define only an average mean damage ratio for an affected\nresidential, commercial or industrial property type (i.e. three ratios). A consequence\nof using a mean damage ratio instead of a vulnerability curve is that only the change\nin flood extent is taken into account and the change in flood depth is not in spite of\nTable 2 A comparison of total exposure over the Greater Mumbai area to the affected exposure for\nthe July 2005 flood event (using population data for 2001 and the observed flood footprint)\nArea Population Exposure (in $ million USD)\n(km2) (thousands) Residential Commercial Industrial Total\nTotal 372 12,800 6,000 3,710 11,530 21,240\nAffected 78 4,200 1,880 1,070 2,110 5,060\nPercentage affected 20% 35% 30% 30% 20% 20%\n148 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nTable 3 Modelled \u2018affected\u2019 exposures for different return period flood events for the Mithi Basin,\nin comparison to the simulated July 2005 event\nArea Population affected Affected exposure Mithi Basin ($ million USD)\n(km2) (thousands) Residential Commercial Industrial\nSimulated 2005 16 1,220 375 180 590\n50 years RP: present 12 710 250 70 0\n50 years RP: future 14 975 315 145 0\n100 years RP: present 12 710 250 105 0\n100 years RP: future 16 1,225 375 180 560\n200 years RP: present 12 715 250 105 0\n200 years RP: future 17 1,275 375 180 590\nits potential importance. For example, in Fig. 3c, one can see that in the 2080s, floods\nare expected to become larger and deeper than today. The estimate of how flood\nlosses will change is therefore underestimated compared with a more comprehensive\nanalysis.\nThe average mean damage ratio that is used here is estimated based on published\nestimates of damages from the July 2005 event. While it would be preferable to use\nmultiple events, this data was not available. The data available for 2005 was also very\nlimited; for this reason, three approaches were used to estimate the vulnerability,\nthen the results compared to produce a single estimate with an uncertainty range.\nThe three approaches used were:\n\u2022 Using published economic loss estimates: The mean damage ratio was given by\nthe ratio of the direct economic loss to affected exposure for the July 2005 event.\nEstimates of residential damages (GoM 2005) were used directly to estimate\nthe residential mean damage ratio. The commercial and industrial economic\ndamages were derived from the total economic damage, using the proportions\nindicated by their affected exposures. The total direct economic losses at state\nlevel were obtained from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (2008) and Swiss Re\n(2006); we assume that 50% of these damages occurred in the Greater Mumbai\nTable 4 Estimated affected exposures for different return period flood events\nArea Population Affected exposure across the Mumbai City\n(km2) (thousands) and suburban districts ($ million USD)\nResidential Commercial Industrial\nSimulated July 2005 78 4,270 1,875 1,070 2,120\n50 years RP: present 55 2,470 1,250 430 0.0\n50 years RP: future 67 3,400 1,565 860 0.0\n100 years RP: present 56 2,470 1,250 645 0.0\n100 year RP: future 78 4,270 1,875 1,070 2,010\n200 year RP: present 57 2,490 1,250 645 0.0\n200 year RP: future 80 4,440 1,875 1,070 2,120\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 149\nTable 5 Estimated direct total economic losses for different return period flood events for Mumbai,\nexcluding infrastructure\nEstimated direct losses [excluding infrastructure] ($ million USD)\nResidential Commercial Industrial Total\nSimulated July 2005 100\u2013300 170\u2013400 220\u2013660 490\u20131,370\n50 years RP: present 70\u2013210 80\u2013190 0 150\u2013400\n50 years RP: future 90\u2013260 120\u2013290 0 210\u2013550\n100 years RP: present 70\u2013210 90\u2013220 0 160\u2013430\n100 years RP: future 100\u2013310 180\u2013420 200\u2013630 490\u20131,350\n200 years RP: present 70\u2013210 90\u2013220 0 160\u2013430\n200 years RP: future 110\u2013320 180\u2013430 220\u2013680 510\u20131,420\narea2 and that around 70% of these losses were related to residential, commercial\nand industrial damages (extracting infrastructure as given in Hallegatte et al.\n(2011b), in this issue), giving total losses of 1.7 billion USD.\n\u2022 Using insured loss estimates: Here, the mean damage ratio was given by the\nratio of the insured loss (from RMS insurance claims data) to affected insured\nexposure (from the RMS INEQ model) for the July 2005 event. The benefit of\nthis approach is that these estimates are more widely available and they require\nno assumption about insurance penetration.\n\u2022 Using RMS proprietary vulnerability curves: Simplified flood vulnerability\ncurves for a generic industrial, commercial or residential facility were combined\nwith estimates of flood depth across the Mumbai City and Suburban Districts\n(obtained from media reports) to derive a mean damage ratio. The mean flood\ndepths were assumed to be around 0.1\u20130.25 m in Mumbai City and 0.25\u20130.5 m in\nthe Suburbs based on Gupta (2007) and local media reports.\nDrawing together the results from each of these approaches, we estimate an average\nmean damage ratio of: 5\u201315% for residential properties; 15\u201335% for commercial\nproperties; and 10\u201330% for industrial properties. These ranges are relatively narrow,\ngiving confidence in the individual estimation approaches.\n3.4 Direct damage estimates for Mumbai\nThe direct damage costs are defined as the costs of repairing or replacing assets\nthat have been damaged or destroyed (at the pre-event price level). Table 5 gives\nestimates of the direct damages from flooding in Mumbai for different return period\nrainfall events. This is calculated by applying the average mean damage ratios\n(derived above) to the affected exposure estimates (from Table 4). The ranges reflect\nthe uncertainty in vulnerability. Table 6 gives an estimate of the total direct losses\nincluding infrastructure losses; where these losses are assumed to be around 40% of\n2Estimated based GoM 2005, e.g. Greater Mumbai accounted for slightly over half of the total\nresidential property losses.\n150 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nTable 6 Estimated total direct\nlosses for different return\nperiod flood events for\nMumbai including\ninfrastructure losses\nEstimated total direct losses (including\ninfrastructure) $ million USD\nPresent-day 2080s\nSimulated July 2005 690\u20131910 \u2013\n50 years RP 210\u2013570 290\u2013760\n100 years RP 230\u2013600 690\u20131890\n200 years RP 230\u2013600 720\u20131990\nthe total value of residential, commercial and industrial losses (see Hallegatte et al.\n2011b in this issue). The loss estimates for the July 2005 event ($690\u2013$1910 million\nUSD) are roughly in line with the $1.7 billion losses estimated above.\nThe results suggest that losses associated with a 1-in-50 year extreme rainfall event\ncould rise by 35%, but losses associated with a 1-in-100 year event could rise by 200%\n(i.e. triple) and for a 1-in-200 year event, losses could rise by up to 230%.\nIt should be noted that this study\u2019s estimates of future costs do not take into\naccount population and economic growth. In reality, the Indian urbanization rate\nand economic production are increasing very rapidly and this is likely to continue\nto increase flood risk in Mumbai in the absence of adaptation. For instance, the\npopulation of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region increased from 13 to 17 million\ninhabitants from 1991 to 2008. In 2025, it has even been estimated that the Mumbai\npopulation might increase to up to 28 million inhabitants (Regional Plan for Mumbai\nMetropolitan Region 1996\u20132011, by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development\nauthority). This will not only increase the exposure to flooding, but also put further\nstrain on the natural and manmade drainage systems if improvements are not\nimplemented, potentially increasing hazard and risk levels. In addition, without\nimprovements to the drainage systems, sea level rise will reduce their effectiveness\nand further increase hazard and risk levels.\n4 Evaluating the total economic impacts of flooding\nDirect losses, the costs of replacing and reconstructing damaged buildings and\ninfrastructure, account for only a fraction of total cost of a disaster, particularly in\nthe case of large-scale events (Tierney 1997; Pielke and Pielke 1997; Lindell and\nPrater 2003; Hallegatte et al. 2007). After an event, the total economic costs can\nbe amplified through: (1) spatial or sectoral diffusion of direct costs into the wider\neconomic system over the short-term (e.g. through disruptions of lifeline services,\nsuch as communication and transportation networks) and over the longer term (e.g.\nsectoral inflation due to demand surge, energy costs, company bankruptcy, job losses,\nlarger public deficit, or housing prices); (2) social responses to the shock (e.g. loss of\nconfidence, change in expectations, indirect consequences of inequality deepening);\n(3) financial constraints impairing reconstruction (e.g. low-income families cannot\nfinance rapidly the reconstruction of their home); and (4) technical constraints\nslowing down reconstruction (e.g. availability of skilled workers, difficulties in equip-\nment and material transportation, difficulties in accommodating workers). These\nadditional losses are described as indirect economic costs. These costs are dependent\non the scale and timing of the event and on local conditions; as such, they are difficult\nto project. However, estimates of indirect costs must be included in decision-making\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 151\nto ensure a fair cost\u2013benefit analysis of protection infrastructures or mitigation\nactions. Understanding the key mechanisms that regulate indirect effects may also\nprovide useful knowledge on how to respond to a disaster.\nIndirect costs can be defined as the reduction in production of goods and services,\nmeasured in terms of value-added (to avoid double-counting issues). These costs\nare important, as they participate in the reduction of available consumption, and\ntherefore in the impact on welfare. For example, if a $100 m plant is destroyed and\nimmediately rebuilt, the total loss would be $100 m; whereas, if reconstruction is\ndelayed by 1 year, the total consumption loss will be the sum of the replacement cost\n(the direct cost) and the value-added of 1 year of production (the indirect cost). Here,\nour estimates of indirect costs include business interruption in the event aftermath,\nvalue added losses during the reconstruction period and loss in housing services. The\nvalue of such production losses, in a broad sense, can be very high in some sectors,\nespecially when basic needs are at stake (housing, health, employment, etc.). Of\ncourse, the real cost of a disaster is not only economic, and also includes fatalities,\ninjuries, moral damages, historical and cultural losses, environmental losses, societal\ndisruptions. In this study, however, we consider only the economic costs.\n4.1 Indirect loss estimation\nThis study uses the Adaptive Regional Input\u2013Output (ARIO, see Hallegatte 2008)\nmodel to assess indirect economic losses in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.3 This\ndynamic model represents the \u2018amplifying\u2019 processes described above, taking into\naccount changes in production capacity due to productive capital losses and adaptive\nbehaviour in disaster aftermaths. Details of the model and methodology are given\nin Appendix B. It should be noted that the uncertainties in this type of modelling\nare large, and therefore, results should be interpreted as indicative of the scale of\npotential damages.\nIndirect losses are calculated by sector based on the upper bound of the direct\nloss estimates given above. To achieve this, direct losses estimates are distributed\nby sector. Residential losses are assumed to only affect households, while industrial\nand commercial (and infrastructure) losses are divided between the ARIO sectors\ndependent on their activity and size (Table 7). The distribution of infrastructure\nlosses is made according to empirical observations on previous events. Table 7 shows\nthe distribution of direct losses between sectors for the July 2005 event; sectors 15\n(\u201celectricity, gas and water supply\u201d) and 16 (\u201ctransportation\u201d) have the largest direct\nlosses because if we take into account public infrastructures, these sectors have the\nhighest quantity of productive capital.\n4.2 Case study of July 2005\nUsing the ARIO model, the local Input\u2013Output (IO) table and the loss distribution\nper sector (Table 7), one can simulate the consequences of the flooding on the\n3The economic model, therefore, considers a region that is larger than just the city of Mumbai. We\nassume, however, that the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is only affected by the flood losses in the\nGreater Mumbai, where direct losses are estimated. Input-Output data for the region are from Pohit\n(2000).\n152 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nTable 7 The ARIO sectors and their equivalent RMS exposure type\nARIO sector RMS exposure Sector-by-sector\ntype distributed direct loss\nin 2005 (million USD)\n1 Primary Industrial 39.4\n2 Food products Industrial 3.9\n3 Beverages related Industrial 0.9\n4 Cotton textiles Industrial 25.3\n5 Wool, silk, jute etc. . .

This simulation is reproduced in Fig. 4, which displays the change\nin value added (VA) in the 25 sectors (x-axis) as a function of time in months (y-axis).\nThe simulation shows both the reduction in VA in the months following the event,\nand the VA increase in construction sector (sector #14) due to reconstruction needs.\nThe losses and gains partly compensate, but the aggregated VA loss (without housing\nsector) for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is still $395 million, for $1.5 billion of\ndirect losses. This reduction corresponds to 1.4% of annual regional GDP; a very\nsignificant economic impact. Given that we have no empirical information on the\neconomic impact of the July 2005 floods, we are not able to validate these results in a\ndetailed manner. A further study on job losses would be a good indicator of welfare\nlosses; unfortunately, consistent data including formal and informal employment in\nMumbai could not be found.\nThe model also provides an assessment of the \u201cproduction loss\u201d in the housing\nsector. Indeed, houses and residential buildings produce a housing service that plays\na major role in ensuring local well-being. The decrease in housing services because of\ndamaged houses and buildings has, therefore, to be taken into account. The model,\nbecause it reproduces the reconstruction period and duration, can assess the total\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 153\n5 10 15 20 25\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\nSectors\nTi\nm\ne \n(m\non\nths\n)\nChange in sector VA (% wrt pre-disaster VA)\n \n \n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nFig. 4 Sector-by-sector change in value added (in %). Note the large increase in production in\nthe construction sector (#14), and the increase in the wood and wood-product sector (#7), due to\nintermediate consumptions of the construction sector\nloss in housing service production. In the July 2005 case, the model estimates this\nloss at $30 million. The overall indirect loss, i.e. the sum of the \u201cproduction loss\u201d in\nthe housing sector and the aggregated VA loss, is estimated to be $425 millions.\nIt should be noted that the long term effects (here, more than 20 months after\nthe shock) are due to a budgetary constraint: households that have gone into debt\n(or have reduced their savings) in order to pay for reconstruction, consume less\nwhile they pay off their debt or rebuild their savings, thus reducing the local final\ndemand. In the case of Mumbai, this effect is important because the flood insurance\npenetration rate is very low. For example, in developed countries, the large insurance\npenetration and government aid for the non-insured (typically) prevent or mitigate\nthis kind of long-term demand effects.\n4.3 Link between direct losses and total losses\nIndirect economic losses, i.e. the decrease in the values added in all sectors during\nthe reconstruction phase, are found to be significant in this analysis, and are strongly\nnon linear with respect to direct losses. This nonlinearity arises from the coupled con-\ntributions of different factors. First, a larger disaster causes larger production losses\nat a given point in time. Second, a larger disaster leads to a longer reconstruction\nperiod and, therefore, production losses last for a longer period. Third, in the case of\na big disaster and a non-homogenous repartition of damages, production bottlenecks\nappear in the production system; one or several sectors are not able to produce\nenough to satisfy the intermediate demands of other sectors. As a consequence,\nthese sectors have in turn to reduce their production. These forward propagations\n154 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nFig. 5 Change in total\nvalue-added (excluding\nhousing services) as a function\nof time, for the 100 years\nreturn period flood event in\npresent conditions and July\n2005 flooding\n0 12 24 36 48\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\nTimes (months)\nVA\n c\nha\nng\nes\n (%\n of\n pr\ne-d\nisa\nste\nr V\nA)\n100yr RP present\nJuly 2005\namplify the initial shock.

In the second case, the instantaneous reduction in value added\nexceed 6% of the pre-event level the month of the event, while it is only about 1% in\nthe first case. Moreover, total production is back to its initial level about 1 year after\nthe shock in the first case, while it takes more than 2 years in the second case.\nAs a result, indirect losses amount only to around $100 millions for the 100-year re-\nturn period event compared to $425 millions for the July 2005 event; that is, for direct\nlosses multiplied by 2.5, the indirect losses are multiplied by 4.

This finding is shown in\nTable 8 below. For example, the total losses for a 100-year return period event are\nprojected to be more than a factor 3 greater by the 2080s. The contribution of indirect\nlosses to total losses increases from 14% ($100 millions) in present-day situation to\n18% ($415 millions) in the 2080s.\nFigure 7 shows the reconstruction dynamics for various types of events in present\nand future (2080s) conditions, compared to the simulated July 2005 event.

In Mumbai,\ntherefore, and according to this modelling exercise, the July 2005 event represents\na useful proxy for what can be expected to occur on average once a century in the\nfuture.\n5 Adaptation to flood risk in Mumbai\nFollowing the 2005 flooding, the Government of Mumbai established a fact-finding\ncommittee (FFC) (the CHITALE Committee) to investigate the causes of the dis-\naster and make recommendations to reduce future risks. Several recommendations\nwere made, with much emphasis on measures to improve the city\u2019s drainage systems,\nand were accepted by the Maharashtra state cabinet in May 2006. Simultaneously,\nthe government launched the Mithi River Bed Restoration Plan, expected to be\ncompleted in June 2010. The plan incorporates several risk reducing measures, in-\ncluding: (1) restoring and widening river and drainage channels; (2) improvements to\ninfrastructure and housing (including retrofitting and renovation of cessed buildings\nand improvements to the condition of informal settlements); (3) land use policies\nand planning; (4) extended risk transfer initiatives; and (5) improved preparedness,\nincluding monitoring, early warning, emergency planning, risk modelling and risk\neducation (MEERP 2007).\nWhile these actions are commendable, they do not appear to consider the poten-\ntial impacts of climate change on the long-term planning horizon. Not considering\nclimate change in present-day disaster risk management can increase potential\nfuture vulnerability and limit flexibility to adapt, leading to costly maladaptation\n(Fankhauser et al. 1999). In addition, to the changes in rainfall explored in this study,\nMumbai will also be exposed to sea level rise and potential increases in the risks\nassociated with of heat waves, tropical cyclones and storm surges. Managing these\ncombined risks could require significant revision of urban planning practices across\ncity to integrate disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation measures (as\nwell as greenhouse gas mitigation) into day-to-day urban development and service\ndelivery activities (Revi 2005).\nTo demonstrate the importance of an integrated approach to disaster risk re-\nduction and climate change adaptation, below we provide a simple analysis of the\npotential risk reducing benefits of four potential policy options, two relevant to\nreducing direct losses from flooding and two relevant to reducing indirect losses.\nThese are not intended to guide specific policy (they are too simplified to do so) and\ndo not represent a complete list of options, but do serve to demonstrate the potential\nof adaptation to limit climate change damages and the need to incorporate it into\ndecision-making around disaster risk management today.\nReducing direct losses from f looding Figure 8 shows the estimated total losses\n(direct and indirect) associated with a 1-in-100 year flood event in Mumbai under\nfive scenarios (respectively, from left to right in Fig. 8): (1) present-day; (2) the 2080s\n(note, under the one \u2018high-end\u2019 climate scenario considered in this study and with\nan unchanged city); (3) the 2080s, with a reduction in the vulnerability of properties\n(e.g. representing strengthened building codes); (4) the 2080s, with an improvement\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 157\nFig. 8 The estimated total\n(direct + indirect) losses for a\n1-in-100 years flood event in\nMumbai under five scenarios\n(from left to right): (1)\npresent-day; (2) 2080s\u2014using\nthe one \u2018high-end\u2019 scenario\nconsidered in this study and an\nunchanged city; (3) 2080s,\nassuming properties are made\nmore resilient and resistant to\nflooding (e.g. through building\ncodes); (4) 2080s, assuming the\ndrainage system is improved\nsuch that it can cope with a\n1-in-50 years rainfall event;\nand (5) combined property\nand drainage improvements 0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nPresent-Day 2080s LOWER\nVULNERABILITY\nDRAINAGE\nSYSTEM 1 in 50\nYR RAINFALL\n2080s\nDRAINAGE\nSYSTEM &\nLOWER\nVULNERABILITY\nLo\nss\nes\n ($\n M\nilli\non\n U\nS)\nin the drainage system; and (5) the 2080s, with a combination of reduced vulnerability\nof properties and improved drainage. The \u2018lower vulnerability\u2019 scenario assumes\na 15% reduction in vulnerability for a 1-in-100 year event (achieved through, for\nexample, building improvements incentivised by building codes) and the improved\ndrainage scenario assumes that the drainage system has been upgraded such that it\ncan cope effectively with a (2080s) 1-in-50 year rainfall event.4 The uncertainties in\nindividual estimates are great and the effectiveness of measures will depend strongly\non the quality of implementation, however, the figure demonstrates that with certain\noptions or combinations of options, Mumbai may be able to offset the increase\nin risk due to climate change (even under this high-end scenario) and also that\nsuch measures can also have significant benefits today; for example, upgrading the\ndrainage system such that it could cope with a 1-in-50 year event today, could reduce\nlosses from a 1-in-100 year event by around 70%.5\nReducing indirect losses from f looding The ARIO model allows us to assess the\nbenefits of sets of policies that aim to enhance disaster recovery; reducing the lost\nproduction due to property damages and therefore the indirect costs of flooding.\nTwo instruments are explored here: firstly, increasing flexibility in the capacity of\nthe construction sector, to speed reconstruction; and secondly, the provision of\ninsurance.\n4A 50-year standard is higher than what is usually used for drainage system (i.e. 10 or 20 years), but\nthe Mumbai climate and the vulnerability of the city to heavy precipitations may justify such a strict\nstandard.\n5The impact of an improved drainage system is assessed very simply in this study and so should be\ntreated as illustrative only. To make this estimate, we define a relationship between affected exposure\n(E) and rainfall (P) at each return period (i.e. ERP = f(PRP)) from the original \u2018un-adapted\u2019 scenario.\nFor the adapted scenario, we estimate a new function f\u2019 (by shifting f) such that E50 = 0. We then\nassume: (i) no flooding for rainfall events with a return period of up to 50 years; and (ii) rainfall with\na return period of above 50 years leads to an affected exposure (E\u2019) given by E\u2019RP = f\u2019(PRP).\n158 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nAdaptive capacity of the construction sector Increasing the flexibility of capacity\nof the construction sector means that damaged buildings and infrastructure can be\nrepaired or replaced more quickly following a disaster, reducing lost production. This\ncan represent, for example, the ability of workers to increase their productivity, or\nthe possibility of workers and equipments from outside the affected region to move\nthere to speed up reconstruction. ARIO allows us to explore the benefits of such\nflexibility in terms of avoided indirect costs through running scenarios of its sectoral\noverproduction parameters. We find that, for the July 2005 event, the indirect effect\nof the disaster on the local economy can vary by a factor of 4 (Fig. 9), depending on\nthe amplitude and quickness of response of the construction sector.\nFrom a policy perspective, this high sensitivity is good news, as it suggests that\nlarge economic losses can be avoided with increased flexibility in the construction\nsector production capacity. The flexibility depends heavily on the pre-event con-\nditions; for example, if idle capacities are present (e.g. unused equipment) they\ncan be mobilized to cope with the disaster (West and Lenze 1994; Hallegatte and\nGhil 2008b), whereas if capacities are fully used then no additional capacity can be\nmobilized. The flexibility of the construction section could be enhanced through:\n\u2022 Enabling qualified workers to settle down temporarily in the affected region (e.g.\nby providing working permit or helping workers to find accommodation).\n\u2022 Organising and sharing reconstruction resources among regions, states or cities\nand setting super-national policies to ensure reconstruction capacity is adequate\nto cope with possible disasters.\n\u2022 Empowering governments to mobilizing their workers (e.g., soldiers) and their\nequipments to speed up reconstruction.\nPast disasters illustrate the barriers to efficient reconstruction and suggest good\npractices. For instance, in the Katrina aftermath, many qualified workers from the\nentire U.S. moved to New Orleans to help reconstruct the city and capture higher\nconstruction-sector wages. Most of these workers, however, had to leave the area\nrapidly because they could not find proper accommodation or because of insufficient\nFig. 9 Indirect losses to direct\nlosses ratio, as a function of\nthe amount of direct losses, for\nfour sets of adaptation\nparameters\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nDirect losses (million USD)\nR\nat\nio\n in\ndi\nre\nct\n lo\nss\nes\n \/ \ndi\nre\nct\n lo\nss\nes\nNo overproduction\n{ 120% ; 6 months }\n{120% ; 3 months }\n{ 150% ; 6 months }\n{ 150% ; 3 months }\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 159\npublic services. Providing housing to temporary workers, therefore, seems to be\nextremely important to speed up reconstruction. Also, these workers left the region\nbecause the reconstruction of many buildings was delayed by legal problems, either\ndue to delays in insurance claim payments or to the slow approval of building\npermits. For reconstruction to be as effective as possible, therefore, it seems that all\nadministrative and legal issues must be solved rapidly, to benefit for the mobilization\nof internal and external resources.\nThe benef its of insurance Financial constraints can play a significant role in de-\nlaying reconstruction (Benson and Clay 2004), and can even lead to a suboptimal\nreconstruction with consequences on productivity (Hallegatte and Dumas 2008a).\nInsurance allows individuals to share risks; in exchange for a regular premium\npayment individuals receive a payout if they experience damage. This means that\nindividuals do not absorb all their reconstruction costs and have fast access to capital\nin the aftermath of a disaster.\nWe can use the ARIO model to investigate the benefits of insurance by exploring\nthe sensitivity of indirect losses to the insurance penetration rate (\u03b3 ) assumed in\nthe model. In ARIO, the insurance penetration affects the response to the shock\nthrough two mechanisms: first, if the insurance penetration of households is low,\nthey have to pay for their reconstruction (either directly, or by getting into debt and\nthen paying off later), and reduce their consumption in order to so. Second, if the\ninsurance penetration of firms is low, firms have to pay for reconstruction, reducing\ntheir profits. As a portion of these profits normally goes to local households, this\naffects the household budget, also reducing their consumption.\nFigure 10 illustrates the effect of insurance penetration on the household\u2019s budget,\nfor a July 2005 like flood estimated using the ARIO model. Three scenarios are\nincluded: (1) \u03b3 = 0, equivalent to the absence of insurance system, but with an\naccess to credit; (2) the current value of flood insurance penetration estimated by\nRMS (\u03b3 = 0.08 for households, \u03b3 = 0.15 for firms); and (3) \u03b3 = 1, representing the\nsituation where all the reconstruction is paid for by insurance. It is important to note\nFig. 10 Household budget as a\nfunction of time, for three\ndifferent penetration rates:\n\u03b3 = 0 (no insurance), current\nvalue estimated by RMS (\u03b3 =\n0.08 for households and \u03b3 =\n0.15 for businesses) and \u03b3 = 1\n(reconstruction is entirely paid\nby the insurance system)\n0 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 108 120\n-400\n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\nTime (months)\nH\nou\nse\nho\nld\n b\nud\nge\nt c\nha\nng\ne \n(U\nSD\n)\n\u03b3 = 0 (no insurance) \nRMS estimates\n\u03b3 = 0.08 (households) \n\u03b3 = 0.15 (businesses) \n\u03b3 = 1 (full insurance) \n160 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nthat our \u201cinsurance penetration rate\u201d does not represent the fraction of the total\namount of houses that is insured, but the fraction of the total value of goods that is\ninsured (never equal to one in the real world, because of ceilings or deductibles).\nMoreover, this analysis investigates only disaster situations, in which insurance\nprovides instantaneous net benefits, not non-disaster situations, in which insurance\nis a net cost. So, we investigate insurance benefits, which should be compared with\nits costs in a full analysis of adaptation options.\nWhere the budget is positive in Fig. 10, it can be interpreted as the total amount\nof savings of households, and where negative it represents debt. We assume that the\nbudget is equal to zero before the disaster and that it tends to return to the initial\nsituation. Figure 10 shows that the lower the penetration rate the more households\nhave to get into debt in order to pay for their reconstruction. When the penetration\nis very large, households make savings after the disaster. This occurs because in this\ncase, the decrease in production is more important than the decrease in demand\n(through the decrease of incomes). Households are rationed and consume less than\nwhat they would like to and as a result, they involuntarily save money.\nVariations in household budget affect the local demand, as households in debt\nreduce their consumption. This decrease in demand affects local production in the\nlong term, as shown in Table 9. When the reconstruction is paid for by the insurance\nsystem, indirect losses are reduced by 37%, compared to the best guess situation, and\nby 42% compared to the no-insurance situation. This demonstrates that even though\nthe gap between two insurance systems does not exceed 0.1% of the baseline value-\nadded at a given point in time, the overall effect on total indirect losses can be very\nimportant.\nThe difference in indirect losses between the no-insurance and the full-insurance\ncases arise from two factors. First, in presence of insurance or perfect access to credit,\nbusinesses and households can restore their productive environment and equipment,\nallowing for a more rapid recovery of the economic activity. Second, insurance\nprevents a reduction in the final demand from affected businesses and households\nthat have to rebuild their savings or pay back their debt. In this analysis, it is the\nsecond mechanism that explains the difference, since households are assumed to\nhave full access to credit in absence of insurance. With a limited access to credit,\na case that will be investigated at a later stage, indirect losses would be even larger\nthan in the worst case presented here.\nThese results provide insight on the aggregated losses that can be avoided at\nthe macroeconomic level due to a well developed insurance system. In addition, a\ngeneralized insurance scheme (that can be accessed by all households and businesses)\nwould help the poorest households and the most fragile businesses to cope with\nfloods. This means that insurance would yield macroeconomic benefits (estimated\nhere), and microeconomic benefits at the household level (not explicitly estimated\nhere, but suggested by Fig. 10). Microeconomic benefits include in particular the\navoidance of increased poverty and inequality. Even though they are difficult to\nTable 9 Total indirect losses,\nas a function of the insurance\npenetration rate, for a\nJuly-2005-like flood\nInsurance penetration rate Total indirect losses ($ million USD)\n0 455\nRMS estimates 425\n1 265\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 161\nestimate in monetary terms, these benefits should be taken into account, e.g. in the\ncost\u2013benefit analysis of the implementation of a micro-insurance scheme.\nFlood insurance coverage would, therefore, be an interesting strategy to reduce\nflood vulnerability and improve aggregate economic resilience in Mumbai, and\nto prevent poor households from falling into poverty after a flood. Insurance,\nhowever, has a cost between disasters and create affordability issues, which are\nnot investigated here. Also, insurance has to be combined with risk-reducing land-\nuse planning and other regulations to avoid incentivising over-development and\ngrowth in exposed areas. In the UK and for many commercial properties in the\ndeveloped world, flood insurance is obtainable from the private insurance market.\nFor residential coverage, many countries have established national flood insurance\nsystems (e.g., the French Cat-Nat system, the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund).\nThese systems may provide useful models for Mumbai; a full discussion of their\nrelative advantages and disadvantages is beyond the scope of this paper. It is worth\nmentioning the benefits of insurance relative to other \u2018financial safety pools\u2019. Local\nand familial solidarity is an established mechanism in many developing countries,\nbut the disadvantage is that access to funding can be slower and limited, and may\nbe impossible when an area or family are all affected at the same time (as is often\nthe case for large-scale disasters like floods). Government support is often necessary\nto some extent (for instance, after Katrina, the U.S. Federal government more or\nless replaced insurance for households that had no flood insurance; Lubell 2006).\nBut relying on it creates inefficient uncertainty for economic actors (e.g., because,\nafter an event, they cannot know the exact scope of the government support they\nwill receive) and can lead to moral hazard (e.g. if households know that they will\nbe compensated by government, they will have little incentive to reduce their own\nrisks or to pay for insurance). International support (grants or goods provided to\naffected people) can help reconstruction, but (in addition to the moral hazard issue)\nis very volatile and unpredictable. Finally, an improved access to credit (especially\nfor the underprivileged) can help during the post-disaster period; e.g. the government\nguaranteeing reconstruction credits. As a conclusion, if the frequency and intensity\nof extreme events in Mumbai is to increase, the development of the insurance system\nand other financial services could have significant benefits in combination with other\nexisting risk sharing mechanisms.\n6 Discussion: adaptation planning and uncertainty\nThis study has demonstrated a number of approaches to enable an adaptation plan-\nner to quantify risks associated with climate change and the benefits of adaptation.\nAn important limitation of this study is that it does not attempt to fully quantify\nthe uncertainties in the analysis. Uncertainty is incorporated at each stage of an\nanalysis (Table 10). Fully quantifying uncertainties at each stage is likely to lead\nto the characteristic \u2018explosion\u2019 of uncertainty (Carter et al. 2007). A number of\nprevious studies have suggested that a \u2018policy-first\u2019 approach, where the quantitative\nanalysis is designed from a policy perspective (rather than a scientific perspective)\nto evaluate the desirability of specific adaptation options against a set of defined\nobjectives, would help to narrow uncertainties in the analysis (Dessai et al. 2009).\nRecognising the scale of the uncertainties, such a process can utilise methods such as\n162 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nTable 10 Summary of uncertainties incorporated into final estimates\nSource of uncertainty Description\nPresent-day hazard Includes uncertainties introduced by statistical analysis of rainfall events\nfrom short data records; the urban flood model; and extrapolations from\none catchment (Mithi) to city-scale. Figure 2 suggests that uncertainties\nrelated to statistical analyses could be large (e.g. estimates of rainfall\nat given return periods were doubled when the 2005 event was included\nin the analysis)\nFuture hazard Includes uncertainties in emissions scenarios; climate modelling, flood\nmodelling, and those introduced by statistical downscaling\nExposure Our approach to estimating property values is sensitive to uncertain\nestimates of insurance penetration. Estimates of future exposure trends\ncan be expected to significantly impact estimates of risk and the\nbenefits of adaptation\nVulnerability Uncertainties in estimates of 2005 vulnerability were quantified by the\nanalysis (Section 3.3) and could be further refined through study of\nother flood events. Extrapolation of 2005 vulnerability estimates to\nfuture events incorporates uncertainty\nIndirect loss modelling Local economic data are largely unavailable, and there is a large\nuncertainty in the current local economic structure. Economic modelling\nof disaster consequences is difficult and various modelling strategies\ncoexist (e.g., CGEs, Input\u2013Output, econometric models), leading to\nlarge differences in results\nrobust decision-making to design strategies that are flexible under a range of climate\nscenarios (Lempert and Collins 2007; Hallegatte 2009; Ranger et al. 2010). These\ntypes of approaches still require quantification of potential risks and benefits of\nadaptation. For example, the risk-based tools presented here are able to demonstrate\nthat there are strong benefits from a number of adaptation measures with or without\nclimate change. The tools can also be used to identifying if and where current disaster\nrisk management plans may become future maladaptations and how these plans\ncould be adjusted to make them robust to long-term climatic changes.\nEach of the uncertainties outlined in Table 10 could significantly affect estimates\nof risk. Some are likely to be irreducible on the timescales that many adaptation\ndecisions must be made; for example, uncertainties related to emissions scenarios\nand climate models. However, many of the other uncertainties are reducible and\nfurther study in these areas could help to refine risk estimates in the near-term. Of\nparticular importance is monitoring and research into understanding current levels\nof hazard, exposure and vulnerability; these elements form the starting point of an\nanalysis of risk and therefore, reducing these uncertainties is likely to be of high value\nin adaptation decision-making as well as present-day disaster risk management.\n7 Conclusions\nThis study has demonstrated the application of a series of tools aimed at quantifying\nrisk and the benefits of adaptation to inform adaptation strategies, using the case\nof flood risk in Mumbai. While the study does not aim to provide a complete\nassessment, it does demonstrate the significant current vulnerability of Mumbai to\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 163\nheavy precipitation, as well as the high potential sensitivity to climate change and the\nstrong need for effective and integrated climate change adaptation.\nThe findings of the study show that disaster risk management and adaptation can\nhave significant benefits both today and in the future, for example, our estimates\nsuggest that by upgrading the drainage system in Mumbai, losses associated with\na 1-in-100 year flood event today could be reduced by as much as 70%, and\nthrough extending insurance to 100% penetration, the indirect effects of flooding\ncould be almost halved, speeding recovery significantly. Given the uncertainties in\nfuture rainfall projections, it may be prudent to explore win\u2013win measures that\nprovide benefits under the broad range of climate scenarios\u2014we demonstrate that\nupgrading the drainage system and supporting an effective insurance mechanism may\nbe examples of such no-regrets measures, others include spatial planning to manage\nnew construction out of high risk areas and increasing public risk awareness.\nThe Government of Maharashtra has laid out comprehensive plans to reduce and\nbetter manage risks associated with flooding in Mumbai. However, it is not clear\nwhether these plans adequately account for the potential increases in flood hazard\nwith climate change. Several studies have shown that not considering climate change\nin long-term planning and investment decisions today can lead to potentially costly\nmaladaptation. In planning disaster risk reduction, it is also important to consider\nother hazards to which the city is exposed and the effects of climate change on\neach (in particular, sea level rise, heavy precipitation, storm surge, high tides and\ntropical cyclone risks). Policies to limit long-term flood hazard will need to be\nconsidered alongside policies related to other risks and objectives (e.g. improving\noverall housing quality or reducing greenhouse gas emissions) to identify synergies\nand minimise conflicts. For example, measures to mitigate sea level rise and inland\nflooding must be considered in tandem as sea level rise could impair any drainage\nimprovements in the city.\nFurther research is also required to consider the implications of uncertainties\nin climate projections for adaptation planning in Mumbai, for example, this study\nshould be extended through the use of multiple projections from a range of available\nGlobal Climate Models and Regional Climate Models. A single scenario of future\nclimate, as used here, is not by itself adequate to inform robust adaptation decisions.\nUncertainties in climate model projections are not likely to be significantly reduced\non the timescale of many adaptation decisions and therefore, further research is\nrequired to demonstrate the integration of quantitative risk analysis tools, like those\npresented here, with approaches to decision-making under uncertainty. We also\ndiscuss the benefits of focussing research and monitoring towards reducing the more\n\u2018reducible\u2019 uncertainties associated with managing extreme events, in particular\nrelated to understanding levels of current hazard, exposure and vulnerability; such\ninvestments would have significant benefits for both climate change adaptation and\npresent-day disaster risk management.\nAppendices\nA SWMM: urban flood modelling in Mumbai\nThe Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was been developed by the US\nEnvironmental Protection Agency for use in the urban hydrology and is widely\n164 Climatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167\nTable 11 The input assumptions of the SWMM model for the Mithi River Basin\nSummary of input assumptions and data sources\nRainfall data as collected and simulated from the Santa Cruz IMD rainfall station\nThe total catchment is divided into 9 sub-catchments with channel characteristics taken from\nGoogle Earth\nThe Slope values in % are derived from SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM)\nThe soil is assumed to have a slow infiltration rate (Hydrologic Soil Group C).

The basic model components include the physical\ncharacteristics of the basin such as topography, soil types, land use characteristics,\nand climate characteristics such as evaporation, temperature and precipitation.\nSWMM has the capacity to model every aspect of urban drainage; combining sewers\nand the natural drainage, whereas other river flood models are generally restricted\nto natural drainage. This makes it most appropriate for modelling flood risk in the\nMumbai area.\nOne of the most important inputs to the model is topographic data in the form\nof a digital elevation model (DEM). This data is obtained from the Shuttle Radar\nTopography Mission (SRTM). The SRTM instrument obtained elevation data on a\nnear-global scale to generate the most complete high-resolution digital topographic\ndatabase of Earth. The 90 m DEM derived from SRTM has been used as primary\nsource for elevation data and is smoothened using standard interpolation techniques.\nThe DEM is further enhanced through validation against topographic maps from the\nSurvey of India.\nTable 11 gives an overview of the input assumptions and data sources used in the\nSWMM model for the Mithi River Basin. It should be noted that tidal effects are\nneglected in this analysis, giving a potential negative bias on flood extent estimates.\nFurther information on SWMM can be located at: http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ednnrmrl\/\nmodels\/swmm\/index.htm\nB The ARIO model\nThe ARIO model (Hallegatte 2008) is based on IO tables and a hybrid modelling\nmethodology, in the spirit of Brookshire et al. (1997). The model takes into account\n(1) the propagation among sectors of reduced productions due to disaster damages;\n(2) the propagation among sectors of reduced demands due to disaster damages;\n(3) the large demand in the construction sector due to reconstruction needs; (4) the\neconomic-agent behaviours to cope with disaster consequences (e.g., by increasing\ntheir production when demand is large, or by finding alternative suppliers when the\noriginal ones cannot produce); (5) the limitations in resource movement between\nsectors (e.g., the construction sector cannot grow instantaneously by hiring workers\nfrom other sectors; it is limited by the availability of qualified workers); (6) the\nClimatic Change (2011) 104:139\u2013167 165\ninteraction with outside the affected regions (through imports and exports). Im-\nportantly, the model assumes that the economy will eventually return to its initial\nsituation. Also, impacts outside the Mumbai region are not assessed, because these\nimpacts are distributed over a large number of economic actors, and are therefore\nsmall (often negligible) on a per capita basis.\nThe model is applied to Mumbai using sector-by-sector macroeconomic data from\nthe National Council of Applied Economic Research downscaled to the Mumbai\nregion. For this study, we introduced three main modifications in the ARIO model\ninitial setting, which is used in the Copenhagen case study in this project (Hallegatte\net al. 2011b):\n\u2022 The modelling of reconstruction demand has been modified to take into account\nthe urgency in reconstruction. In the new version, it is assumed that, in absence\nof any constraint in construction-sector production capacity, all damages would\nbe repaired 3 months (\u03c4 ) after the disaster. Of course, because of technical,\nfinancial, and practical constraints, the actual reconstruction time can be much\nlonger.\n\u2022 The rationing scheme is modified. In the current version, there is a three-stage\nrationing: (1) intermediate consumptions are served first, to ensure that total\noutput is maximum; among industries, the rationing is proportional, with each\nsector receiving the same fraction of its demand; (2) reconstruction needs and\nlocal demand is served second, with again a proportional rationing between\nthe two; (3) exports are served last, if all other demands can be fully satisfied.\nCompared with the previous version, this rationing scheme gives a higher priority\nto local demands and lead to more optimistic results.\n\u2022 When applying ARIO to Mumbai, the assumption that all losses are paid by\ninsurance claim is not acceptable any more. According to RMS, flood insurance\npenetration in Mumbai is around 8% for households and 15% for businesses.\nThe fact that businesses and households have to pay for their reconstruction can\nhave important impacts on the reconstruction duration and causes a crowding-\nout effects on consumption and investment. Budget constraints (for households\nand businesses) may thus have macroeconomic consequences that need to be\naccounted for. To do so, we assume first the businesses pay their reconstruction\nby reducing the profits they redistribute to households. As a consequence, house\nhold income will decrease. Second, household budget constraints have been\nintroduced. In this modeling, we assume that households can borrow to fund\ntheir reconstruction (without borrowing constraints), but that they then have to\npay back over a 2-year period. To reimburse this additional debt, they reduce\ntheir consumption and investment. This factor introduces a consumer backward\npropagation in addition to the mechanisms described in Hallegatte (2008).\nReferences\nAlexander LV et al.
