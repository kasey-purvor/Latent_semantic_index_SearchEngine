INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years the interest in organic semiconductors\nhas grown, mainly due to the success of amorphous thin\nfilms in devices such as organic light emitting diodes\n\u0001OLEDS\u0002 and Xerographic copiers. Mobilities of charge\ncarriers in such thin films are in the order of\n10\u22125\u201310\u22123 cm\u22122 V\u22121 s\u22121, which limits the performance of or-\nganic devices.\nSince the discovery of conduction in conjugated calam-\nitic liquid crystals in the 1990s,1,2 many liquid clystals \u0001LCs\u0002\nhave been characterized and found to have charge carrier\nmobilities in the order of 10\u22124\u201310\u22121 cm\u22122 V\u22121 s\u22121, thus hav-\ning superior charge carrier mobilities compared to most\namorphous thin films, making them good candidates for\nsemiconductor devices.\nCharge transport, however, is fastest in highly ordered\nliquid crystal mesophases, which usually occur above room\ntemperature, and in many cases when cooled to room tem-\nperature these form polycrystalline solids, inducing grain\nboundaries and other defects which in turn result in trapping,\ncausing unfavorable charge transport properties.\nA possible solution is to incorporate polymerizable end\ngroups into the molecular structure of the conjugated liquid\ncrystals forming reactive mesogens \u0001RMs\u0002.3 As with nonre-\nactive mesogens, they are able to form mesophases, which\nonce formed, can be polymerized, and in doing so produce\nan insoluble network, which maintains the structure of the\nmesophase and hopefully the charge transport properties at\nroom temperature.4\nThis process is additionally advantageous in the produc-\ntion of multilayer semiconductor devices such as organic\nfield effect transistors \u0001OFETs\u0002 and OLEDs for two reasons:\n\u00011\u0002 sequential solution based application methods can be eas-\nily used without the solvent from the most recently applied\nlayer facilitating interlayer diffusion and \u00012\u0002 these devices\ncan be laterally patterned by photolithography.\nIt has been reported that the incorporation of such poly-\nmerizable end groups reduces the charge carrier mobility sig-\nnificantly, when compared to the original nonreactive\nmaterial,5 although, for nematic phase RMs, the mobility ap-\npears to increase after the polymerization.6 This has been\nattributed to improvements in positional order and therefore\nincreased \u0001-orbital overlap.\nNo major systematic studies of these systems have ever\nbeen reported in the literature. Thus in this paper we aim to\ndiscuss the effect these reactive end groups have on the\ncharge carrier transport properties.

MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThe general transport behavior observed in calamitic LC\nsystems shows an improvement in mobility as the material\nforms higher order mesophases. The higher the order of the\nmesophase, the better the \u0001-orbital overlap between neigh-\nboring molecules and the higher the subsequent carrier\nmobility.1,7 Consequently one expects higher mobilities in,\nfor example, a smectic G phase compared to a nematic\nphase.\nThree mesogenic cores were used in this study. The first\nset of materials was based on substituted phenylnaphthalenes\n\u0001PNP\u0002. These were chosen due to the well-known behavior\nof the original nonreactive liquid crystal, which exhibited\nambipolar transport with high mobilities, studied by\nFunahashi and Hanna.1 The second set of materials was\nbased on substituted bis\u00014-heptylphenyl\u0002-bithiophene\n\u0001PTTP\u0002, which has previously been reported to demonstrate\nhigh field effect mobilities as a polycrystalline film.8 The\nthird and final set of materials was based on substituted qua-\nterthiophenes \u0001QT\u0002. Quaterthiophenes were chosen as they\nhad been shown to have excellent field effect mobilities as\nvacuum deposited thin films,9 and demonstrate liquid crys-\ntalline behavior when substituted with alkyl chains.5 Com-\npounds 1b, 1c, and 10b were prepared as previously\nreported.4 The details of the preparation of the other materi-\nals can be found in Ref. 10.\nEach of the mesogenic cores was substituted with vari-\nous functional end groups, namely, acrylate, diene, and ox-\netane. All end groups could be polymerized in the presence\nof a suitable initiator; free radical initiators were used for the\nacrylate and diene end groups, and a cationic initiator was\nused for the oxetane group. The use of common conjugated\ncores allowed the study of how each of the end groups af-\nfected the charge transport properties of the core LC group,\nboth before and after polymerization.\nThe phase behavior of all the materials was character-\nized using differential scanning calorimetry \u0001DSC\u0002 and po-\nlarized microscopy. Thermal transitions were determined by\nusing a Perkin Elmer DSC-7. Liquid crystalline textures\nwere observed under a Leica DMLP optical microscope with\na Linkam DMLP hot stage and TMS93 controller.\nGlass liquid crystal cells with indium tin oxide \u0001ITO\u0002\nelectrodes, with known interelectrode distances, were\nmounted on a modified Linkam LTS350 hot stage. The cells\nused varied in thickness from \u00051 to \u000510 \u0002m and were\ncoated with antiparallel rubbed polyimide alignment layers.\nThe liquid crystal cell was filled by capillary action by melt-\ning the material above the clearing point and then cooled to\nthe required mesophases. Connected to one of the electrodes\nis the output from a variable dc power supply, allowing the\nelectric field to be varied. The counterelectrode is connected\nvia a load resistor to the ground at the input of an Agilent\ninfinium digitizing oscilloscope.\nA 6 ns UV \u0001337 nm\u0002 pulse from a Lambda Physik N2\nlaser incident upon the top electrode is used to create\nelectron-hole pairs within a skin depth \u0001\u0003\u0006100 nm\u0002. In the\ncase of the top electrode being positive, electron recombina-\ntion occurs at the top electrode, while the holes drift through\nthe bulk of the sample, inducing a current in the external\ncircuit, and before recombining at the counterelectrode. For\nelectron transport the direction of the electric field is simply\nreversed. Thus the transit time tt of the photogenerated car-\nriers traversing the liquid crystal was determined from an\ninflection point on a double logarithmic plot of the transient\nphotocurrent. Charge carrier mobility \u0002 was then calculated\nusing the equation \u0002=d2 \/Vtt, or in the case of field indepen-\ndent mobility, by the gradient of a drift velocity versus elec-\ntric field plot. The signal to noise ratio was improved by\nsignal averaging and the coherent rf noise, generated by the\nlaser, is eliminated by background subtraction.\nIn order to polymerize the materials the addition of a\nsuitable photoinitiator is needed, typically 0.5 wt %. The\nphotoinitiators Irgacure 651 \u00012,2-dimethoxy-1,2-diphenyl-\nethan-1-one, Ciba Geigy\u0002 and Omnicat 550 \u000110-biphenyl-4-\nyl-2-isopropyl-9-oxo-9H-thioxanthen-10-ium hexafluorphos-\nphate, IGM resins\u0002 were used for the polymerization of diene\nand oxetane end groups, respectively. The sample is then\nloaded as previously described and cooled to the relevant\nmesophase. Photopolymerization is achieved using the\n405 nm wavelength output from a continuous wave diode\nlaser \u000115 mW\u0002 for over 60 min. Although the domain size\nformed is generally a function of material, mesophase, and\ncooling rate on formation, the polymerized films showed\nsimilar domain sizes to the nonpolymerized samples, typi-\ncally of the order of 25 \u0002m or greater in the smectic phase.\nThe polymerization of the sample was confirmed by raising\nthe sample temperature above the clearing point and, under\npolarized microscopy, observing the illuminated areas main-\ntain their phase structure, in contrast to the nonilluminated\narea which underwent transition to the isotropic phase. No\nphase changes were observed in the polymerized films dur-\ning the heating procedure. For a full and comprehensive re-\nview of polymerization involving RMs please see Ref. 11\nIII. RESULTS\nA.

Only hole transport was investigated, since the\nsamples were prepared in air, and the presence of oxygen is\nknown to suppress electron transport.\nThe hole transport observed in the smectic A phase of\n8PNPO12 \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004 was in excellent agreement with litera-\nture values reported by Funahashi and Hanna.1 The transport\nwas nondispersive and with a mobility of 2.7\n\u000410\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 \u0001SmA, 110 \u00b0C\u0002.\nIn both phenylnaphthalene RMs, the hole transport in the\nsmectic phase became dispersive and the mobility was sig-\nnificantly reduced. For PNP-acrylate \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004 the mea-\nsured hole mobility was 4.9\u000410\u22125 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and for PNP-\ndiene \u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004 7.4\u000410\u22125 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121\nPolymerization of PNP-acrylate was then attempted,\nhowever, in the presence of photoinitiator the material al-\nways thermally polymerized before the cell could be loaded.\nConsequently, it was concluded that acrylate end groups\nwere too thermally unstable for this processing technique\nand thus did not allow enough control of phase in which\npolymerization occurred. In the case of PNP-diene there was\na factor of 4 decrease in mobility when compared to the\noriginal nonreactive LC, however, we did not investigate this\nmaterial further \u0001e.g., postpolymerization studies\u0002 as higher\nmobility RMs became available. The PNP family results are\nsummarized in Table II.\nB. Charge carrier transport in PTTP materials\nTime-of-flight \u0001TOF\u0002 studies were then conducted on the\nnonreactive PTTP \u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002, see Table I for phase behavior\u0004.\nThis material displayed fast ambipolar transport \u0001Fig. 3\u0002 in\nthe smectic phase \u0001SmG\u0002, with resulting hole mobility \u0002hole\n=4.4\u000410\u22122 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and electron mobility \u0002electron=7.1\n\u000410\u22122 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 \u0001both are dispersive and field dependent,\nquoted here at 4\u0004104 V cm\u22121\u0002. These promising LC charge\ntransport properties made this a suitable core for substitution\nwith reactive end groups.\nThe RM PTTP-diene \u0001nonpolymerized\u0002 \u0003Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002\u0004 was\ninvestigated; this also displayed ambpolar transport, once\nagain in the SmG phase. Both holes and electrons were\nfound to be dispersive. Mobilities were reduced compared to\nthe original material with a drop of almost an order of mag-\nnitude for the holes, \u0002hole=6.6\u000410\u22123 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, and by a\nfactor of 40 mobility in the electrons, \u0002electron=1.7\n\u000410\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121.\nThe nonpolymerized PTTP-oxetane \u0003Fig. 2\u0001c\u0002\u0004 results\nwere much more encouraging. When the material was in the\nsmectic B phase, the electron transport was dispersive, how-\nFIG. 1.

In the SmB\nphase the hole transport remained nondispersive, reaching\n\u0002hole=9.5\u000410\u22123 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 \u0001see Fig. 4\u0002. Within the smectic\nB phase both holes and electrons displayed transport that was\nfield independent and temperature dependent \u0001Fig. 5\u0002. Upon\ntransition into the crystalline phase long featureless decays\nwere observed, implying that trapping was occurring. Thus\nno mobility could be measured.\nPTTP-diene was mixed with 0.5 wt % initiator for poly-\nmerization. The material was then polymerized at 135 \u00b0C\n\u0001smectic G\u0002. The charge transport was measured from\n15 to 195 \u00b0C, electron and hole mobilities appear to be both\nindependent of temperature and electric field \u0001Fig. 6\u0002, typi-\ncally \u0002electron=7.5\u000410\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and \u0002hole=7.1\n\u000410\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. Electron transport was found to be dis-\npersive, while hole transport was nondispersive.\nPolymerization of PTTP-oxetane was carried out as pre-\nviously described this time using 0.5 wt % cationic initiator.\nThe polymerization process was carried out at 140 \u00b0C\n\u0001SmB\u0002. The sample was then cooled to 15 \u00b0C and a field\nindependent hole mobility was measured, \u0002hole=1.6\n\u000410\u22122 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 \u0001Fig. 7\u0002. The electron transport was\nfound to be field dependent and dispersive, \u0002electron=2.8\n\u000410\u22122 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 at 4\u0004104 V cm\u22121 \u0001Fig. 8\u0002. The hole and\nelectron mobilities displayed weak temperature dependence\n\u0001Fig. 9\u0002. All the PTTP family results are summarized in Table\nIII. The charge transport obtained when PTTP-oxetane was\npolymerized in the smectic phase was in stark contrast to the\ncharge transport behavior observed when a PTTP-oxetane\nsample was deliberately polymerized in the isotropic phase.\nIn the case of an isotropic phase polymerized film, feature-\nless long time photocurrent decays were obtained at room\ntemperature, where the carrier transit was not observed.\nC.

DISCUSSION\nA. General observations on the charge transport\nCharge transport in reactive mesogens, and their appli-\ncations to OLEDs have been previously reported in\nliterature.6,12,13 Hole and electron mobilities for nematic\nphase calamitic RMs have been low \u0001in the range of\n10\u22125\u201310\u22123 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121\u0002, much lower than those possible in\nhigh order smectic phase liquid crystalline systems.1 It is\ntherefore important to begin the molecular design of any\ncross-linkable system with a LC core, which displays the\nfastest possible transport.\nTable II shows that when the starting material itself\n\u00018PNPO12\u0002 has low mobility \u0001SmA: 2.7\u000410\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121\u0002,\nany reactive mesogens synthesized will not have exceptional\ntransport properties. We also determined that the thermal in-\nstability of the acrylate end group made use of PNP-acrylate\ndifficult, at least when the device processing requires el-\nevated temperatures. Uncontrolled thermal polymerization\nwas not as dramatic in the case of PNP-diene, and this is\nreflected in the modest improvement of the hole mobility\ncompared to the acrylate, although we cannot rule out that\nthis difference may be due to the size and shape of the diene\nand the different LC phase. Thermal polymerization intro-\nduces an unnecessary complicating factor when attempting\nto establish the mechanisms affecting the charge transport\nand is best avoided. Oxetane reactive groups are known to be\nthermally stable and showed no evidence of thermal cross-\nlinking in any material studied.\nFIG. 9.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nThe high order SmG phase formed by PTTP yielded ex-\ncellent electron and hole mobilities, approaching\n10\u22121 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 \u0001Table III\u0002, making this a suitable candidate\nLC core. When the transport is compared to the mesophase\ntransport of the two RMs synthesized, PTTP-oxetane and\nPTTP-diene, the usual reduction in mobility is observed. The\nPTTP-oxetane results were obtained in the SmB phase and\nyielded respectable mobilities of the order of\n10\u22122 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 for both holes and electrons, corresponding\nto reductions of factors of \u00054 and \u00056, respectively. In this\ncase, the oxetane end group had a much smaller effect on the\ntransport, compared to the diene, where the mobilities mea-\nsured in the high order SmG phase were reduced by a factor\nof \u00057 in the case of holes and a factor of \u00051000 in the case\nof electrons. The presence of the diene end group clearly\naffects the electron transport greatly compared to the hole\ntransport. When the hole transport displayed by the two RMs\nis compared, we note that the higher order SmG phase\npresent in the diene substituted molecules has no compensat-\ning effect on the mobility when compared to the lower order\nSmB phase data obtained from the oxetane substituted mol-\necule. Postpolymerization results yielded long-range charge\ntransport in both systems over a large temperature range,\nincluding room temperature, with mobilities comparable to\nthe RM mesophases. In the case of PTTP-oxetane, the elec-\ntron mobility was found to be temperature independent and\nthe hole mobility showed a weak temperature dependence\n\u0001Fig. 9\u0002, whereas PTTP-diene displayed temperature inde-\npendent hole and electron mobilities. The electron mobility\nin PTTP-diene increased postpolymerization, compared to\nthe mesophase value, suggesting that the diene end groups\nact as chemical traps for the electrons. This is in contrast to\nthe hole data, which showed a decreasing postpolymeriza-\ntion, perhaps as a result of trapping due to the residues from\nthe photoinitiator. If the diene moiety was solely affecting\nthe molecular ordering in the nonpolymerized RM, rather\nthan acting as a chemical trap, we would expect an equally\ndetrimental effect on the charge transport, irrespective of po-\nlarity; this is not the case. Although not conclusive, there is\nindirect evidence for chemical trapping due to the diene moi-\neties. In the case of the polymerized PTTP-oxetane there\nwere modest increases to both electron and hole mobilities\ncompared to the mesophase RM results \u0001it is unclear whether\nthese increases are significant, or simply due to sample to\nsample variation\u0002, however, they approach the values mea-\nsured for the original LC core. These were previously re-\nported by this group.14 The cationic photoinitiator used in the\noxetane polymerization reaction did not appear to affect\ncharge transport, in contrast to what is observed from the\ndiene results where a free radical photoinitiator was used.\nTABLE III.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nHigh electron and hole mobilities, approaching\n10\u22121 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, were measured in the SmG phase of QT\n\u0001Table IV\u0002, again suggesting this to be a suitable core for\nsubstitution with reactive end groups. The mesophase trans-\nport measured in the two RMs shows the relative decrease\ncompared to the nonreactive system, observed in all cases so\nfar. In the case of QT-diene the electron transport was totally\nsuppressed, leading to featureless photocurrent decays, while\nthe hole mobility showed an approximately one order of\nmagnitude drop. The comparison of the mobilities in this\ncase is more straightforward as both LC and RM were mea-\nsured in the SmG phase. Electron transport was observed in\nthe case of the QT-oxetane RM, although both hole and elec-\ntron mobilities have been reduced by factors of \u00059 and \u000511,\nrespectively, when compared to the LC. When the QT-\noxetane was polymerized there was no recovery of the hole\nmobility, although the transport was measured over a broad\ntemperature range, remaining largely temperature indepen-\ndent \u0001Fig. 15\u0002.\nA number of significant observations emerge from this\nstudy. Firstly we have demonstrated that the reactive me-\nsogen approach is successful in forming semiconducting lay-\ners with desirable transport properties available across a\nbroad temperature range, including room temperature. There\nis a large variation in these properties, from system to sys-\ntem, however, we can generally observe that diene end\ngroups always reduce electron transport, thus, diene contain-\ning RMs are unsuitable where ambipolar transport is needed.\nWe find this not to be the case where the oxetane end group\nis concerned. Secondly, it is the combination of both core\nand end groups which is critical in forming high mobility\ncross-linked films for use in device applications \u0001e.g., PTTP-\noxetane was successful, whereas QT-oxetane was not\u0002. We\nalso find that the choice of photoinitiator used in the poly-\nmerization reaction may affect the transport. This, of course,\nis an example of the well-known effect that impurities have\non the transport in all organic systems.15 It is also known that\nmorphology plays a crucial role in charge transport, x-ray\ndiffraction studies are being carried out on RM and LC sys-\ntems in order to investigate how the addition of the end\ngroup affects molecular packing and consequently the charge\ntransport properties.\nThirdly, and perhaps most surprisingly, the polymerized\nfilms produced display temperature independent charge\ntransport. This is in contrast to amorphous polymer semicon-\nductors where very strong temperature dependence is\nobserved.16,17 One could assume that the cross-linked film\nwould behave as a high molecular weight polymer, with cor-\nresponding temperature dependent charge transport. Liquid\ncrystalline mesophases commonly display temperature inde-\npendent transport1,18 \u0001albeit within the limited range avail-\nable within a mesophase\u0002 and similar theoretical approaches\nto those used in LC systems are described in Sec.

Traditional hopping\nmodels used for organic materials, such as polymers, are\nusually applied to highly temperature dependent\ntransport.19,20 The well-known B\u00e4ssler disorder formalism,19\nwhich considers the motion of the charges to hop within a\nGaussian distribution of the energies and distances of the\nsites, has been used in polymer semiconductor literature,16,17\nwhere the hopping mechanism itself is viewed as a thermally\nactivated process of overbarrier jumps and tunneling be-\ntween hopping sites. Thus hopping mobility is both field and\ntemperature dependent. In the case of low energetic disorder\nit can give rise to weakly temperature dependent mobilities,\nas observed in our systems, and will be discussed in detail in\nSec. IV B 2.\nAnother possible solution resulting in a temperature in-\ndependent mobility is based on the Holstein polaron\nmodel.21,22 This model has been applied to discotic and ca-\nlamitic systems in the past,23\u201326 in order to explain the lack\nof temperature dependent transport found in many LC me-\nsophases and is applied in Sec. IV B 1.\n1. Holstein small polaron\nIn the Holstein model, the charge forms a localized po-\nlaron by distorting its surroundings, and this polaron is char-\nacterized by its binding energy Ep and the transfer integral\n\u0001bandwidth\u0002 between neighboring sites, J. In the nonadia-\nbatic limit, that is, when the nearest-neighbor transfer inte-\ngral J between two hopping sites is much smaller than the\npolaron binding energy Ep, i.e., J\u0005Ep. The Holstein polaron\nmobility can be expressed as\n\u0002p =\n1\n\u0001kBT\u00023\/2\ned2\n\u0006\n\u0007 \u00012Ep\b\n1\/2\nJ2 exp\u0007 \u2212 Ep2kBT\b , \u00011\u0002\nwhere d is the intermolecular distance and the other symbols\nhave their usual meanings. We notice that Eq. \u00011\u0002 contains\nboth preexponential and exponential factors that depend on\nT\u22121. It is therefore possible that, given the right combination\nof binding energy and bandwidth values, an increase in tem-\nperature would lead to a drop in the preexponential factor\nwhich would compensate the rise due to the exponential fac-\ntor, and so result in a temperature independent mobility.\nLiquid crystalline materials exhibit weak van der Waals\nintermolecular interactions and because the transfer integral\n\u0001J\u0002 is a measure of the interaction energy between two neigh-\nboring molecules, we would expect J to be small, thus justi-\nfying the use of the nonadiabatic limit.\nEquation \u00011\u0002 implies that a plot of ln\u0001\u0002T3\/2\u0002 against T\u22121\nwould give a straight line with a gradient m, given by\nm =\n\u2212 Ep\n2kB\n, \u00012\u0002\nand y axis intercept C, given by\nC = ln\t 1\u0001kB\u00023\/2 ed\n2\n\u0006\n\u0007 \u00012Ep\b\n1\/2\nJ2\n . \u00013\u0002\nThus Ep and J can be recovered from such a plot.\nMobility-temperature data for all three polymerized sys-\ntems were fitted to Eq. \u00011\u0002. One such example \u0001PTTP-\noxetane\u0002 is shown in Fig. 16 and the resulting values for the\ntransfer integral J and the polaron binding energy for all\nthree systems can be found in Table V. In all cases, a typical\nsmectic phase intermolecular distance d=4.5 \u00c5 was used for\nthe calculations. Although this is a realistic value, we note\nthat any error in the intermolecular distance value used\nwould only affect the calculated transfer integral.\nTABLE IV.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nWith the exception of electrons in PTTP-oxetane, we\nnote that the recovered values in Table V satisfy the condi-\ntion that the Polaron binding energy Ep must be much larger\nthan the transfer integral J, i.e., J\u0005Ep, confirming the appli-\ncability of the nonadiabatic limit. Although the Holstein\nsmall polaron model is strictly one dimensional, it seems to\nfit the data well in what is expected to be, essentially, two\ndimensional transport within smectic lamella. All calculated\ntransfer integral values are below 30 meV, as expected in the\ncase of organic molecular crystals,27 and in agreement with\nliterature values on similar systems.23,26 The transfer integral\nvalues for both electrons and holes in PTTP-oxetane \u000118 and\n19 meV, respectively\u0002 are much larger than those calculated\nfor the other systems \u0001ranging from 1 eV to 3 meV\u0002 and in\nqualitative agreement with the relatively higher mobility\nmeasured in this system, as a greater wave function overlap\nwould result in higher charge mobility. Polaron binding en-\nergy values derived for holes in the three systems range from\n102 to 194 meV. These are of the expected order of magni-\ntude for such systems23 and compare favorably with those\nderived for the calamitic smectic system 8PNP-O12.23 In all\ncases, the polaron binding energies calculated for electrons\nwere smaller than those for the corresponding holes, al-\nthough they are of the same order of magnitude as the hole\nvalues, and therefore seem plausible. Because of the preva-\nlence of hole transporting organic materials in the literature,\nsimilar analyses have reported hole binding energies and\ntransfer integrals only,23\u201326 making electron value compari-\nsons impossible.\n2. B\u00e4ssler Gaussian disorder formalism\nIn this model the site energies have a Gaussian distribu-\ntion, width \u0007, whereas the positional disorder of the sites is\ncharacterized by the dimensionless parameter \u000b. This has\npreviously been applied to calamitic systems.28 The empiri-\ncal expression for the field and temperature dependence of\nthe carrier mobility is given by19\n\u0002\u0001T,E\u0002 = \u00020e\u2212\u00012\u0007\/3kBT\u0002\n2\neC0\n\fE\u0003\u0001\u0007\/kBT\u00022\u2212\b2\u0004 \u00014\u0002\nin the case of large positional disorder \u0003in the case of small\npositional disorder, \u000b\t1.5; the expression \u000b2 in Eq. \u00014\u0002 is\nreplaced by 2.25\u0004. The prefactor \u00020 represents the zero field,\ninfinite temperature mobility, whereas the constant C0 is em-\npirically determined \u0003it has been determined as 2.9\n\u000410\u22124 \u0001cm\/V\u00021\/2 for a 0.6 nm cubic lattice\u0004. A typical\nPoole-Frenkel plot of mobility, parametric in temperature, is\nshown in Fig. 17. The superposition of the different tempera-\nture data sets clearly demonstrates the lack of temperature\ndependence in the transport. By fitting exponential expres-\nsions to each data set one can extract the zero field mobility\nas well as the field dependence of the mobility. According to\nEq. \u00014\u0002, the zero field mobility should have the following\nbehavior:\n\u0002\u00010,T\u0002 = \u00020e\u2212\u00012\u0007\/3kBT\u00022. \u00015\u0002\nThus, by plotting ln\u0003\u0002\u00010,T\u0002\u0004 vs 1\/T2 one can extract both\nthe prefactor \u00020 and the energetic disorder \u0007 from the inter-\ncept and gradient, respectively. One such plot is shown in\nFig. 18; we note that it has a negative gradient, consistent\nwith theory. The derived parameters are summarized in Table\nVI. We note that in all cases the energetic disorder param-\neters are much smaller than those found in polymeric sys-\ntems \u0001\u000520 compared to \u0005100 meV\u0002. Small energetic disor-\nder values have previously been reported by Ohno and\nHanna28 in comparable calamitic systems \u0001\u000560 meV in SmB\n8PNPO12\u0002, although we note that in their case those were\nthe values used in Monte Carlo simulations which agreed\nwith experiment, rather than extracting the values from the\ntemperature dependence as presented here. A similar ap-\nproach to Ohno and Hanna was used by Bleyl et al.29 to\ncalculate small energetic disorder values in discotic systems\n\u000148 meV in columnar triphenylene dimer H4TD10\u0002.

In the case of polymer-\nized RM systems the carriers are delocalized within the aro-\nmatic cores and there is no distribution of delocalization\nlengths, thus we expect small energetic disorder values. We\nnote that in the case of the \u00020 values found in Table VI, only\nthe value obtained for PTTP-oxetane agrees with literature\nvalues in other systems \u0001\u000510\u22122 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121\u0002,15,16,28,29 with\nthe values obtained for the two other systems appearing sur-\nprisingly small.\nThe positional disorder \u000b and empirical constant C0 val-\nues are usually extracted from the field and temperature de-\npendence of the mobility by the following method. Rewriting\nEq. \u00014\u0002 as\n\u0002\u0001T,E\u0002 = \u00020e\u2212\u00012\u0007\/3kBT\u0002\n2\ne\n\n\fE\n,\nwhere \n = C0\t\u0007 \u0007kBT\b\n2\n\u2212 \b2\n \u00016\u0002\nand taking the logarithm of the expression and differentiating\nwith respect to \fE yields\n\u0003 ln \u0002\u0001T,E\u0002\n\u0003\fE\n= \n = C0\u0007 \u0007kBT\b\n2\n\u2212 C0\b2. \u00017\u0002\nA plot of \n vs \u0001\u0007 \/kBT\u00022 should have a gradient equal to C0\nand y-axis intercept equal to \u2212C0\u000b2. Unfortunately the\namount of scatter in all plots of \n vs \u0001\u0007 \/kBT\u00022 obtained with\nthe polymerized RM results was totally unacceptable, mean-\ning that no values for \u000b or C0 are presented here.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nCross-linked networks formed by reactive mesogens\nform charge transport layers with a wide range of mobilities\n\u000110\u22125\u201310\u22122 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121\u0002, offering the choice of unipolar or\nambipolar transport and displaying stable, temperature inde-\npendent mobilities. The range of mobilities available makes\nthem attractive as customized charge transport layers, where\nbalanced hole and electron transport is required for efficient\ndevice performance. Although some reactive end groups\n\u0001e.g., dienes\u0002 act as chemical traps for electron transport in\nreactive mesogens, as indicated by the mobility recovery oc-\ncurring post-cross-linking, their trapping effect alone is not\nsufficient to explain the lower mobilities invariably found in\nRMs, when compared to nonreactive LC systems. The theo-\nretically predicted Holstein small polaron mobility \u0001nonadia-\nbatic limit\u0002 adequately explains the weak temperature depen-\ndence found in these systems, and the deduced values for the\npolaron binding energy and transfer integral appear both in-\nternally consistent and in agreement with literature values.\nThe weak temperature and field dependence of the mobility\nin these systems can also be explained in the context of the\nB\u00e4ssler Gaussian disorder formalism by the small values ob-\ntained for the energetic disorder parameters in agreement\nwith literature. It is worth noting that while the small polaron\nmodel only takes into account the microscopic nature of the\ncharge transfer between sites and associated energetic reor-\nganization, the energetic disorder model takes into account\nthe transport within a distribution of site energies, neglecting\nthe microscopic nature of the charge transfer. A more com-\nplete theoretical description of these systems ought to take\ninto account both phenomena.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe wish to thank Dr. K. S.
