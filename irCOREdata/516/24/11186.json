Geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) flowing\nin technological systems on the ground are a direct manifes-\ntation of space weather. Due to the proximity of very dy-\nnamic ionospheric current systems, GIC are of special inter-\nest at high latitudes, where they have been known to cause\nproblems, for example, for normal operation of power trans-\nmission systems and buried pipelines. The basic physics un-\nderlying GIC, i.e. the magnetosphere \u2013 ionosphere interac-\ntion and electromagnetic induction in the ground, is already\nquite well known. However, no detailed study of the drivers\nof GIC has been carried out and little is known about the\nrelative importance of different types of ionospheric current\nsystems in terms of large GIC. In this study, the geomagnetic\nstorm of 6\u20137 April 2000 is investigated. During this event,\nlarge GIC were measured in technological systems, both in\nFinland and in Great Britain. Therefore, this provides a ba-\nsis for a detailed GIC study over a relatively large regional\nscale. By using GIC data and corresponding geomagnetic\ndata from north European magnetometer networks, the iono-\nspheric drivers of large GIC during the event were identified\nand analysed. Although most of the peak GIC during the\nstorm were clearly related to substorm intensifications, there\nwere no common characteristics discernible in substorm be-\nhaviour that could be associated with all the GIC peaks. For\nexample, both very localized ionospheric currents structures,\nas well as relatively large-scale propagating structures were\nobserved during the peaks in GIC. Only during the storm\nsudden commencement at the beginning of the event were\nlarge-scale GIC evident across northern Europe with coher-\nent behaviour. The typical duration of peaks in GIC was also\nquite short, varying between 2\u201315 min.\nKey words.

Pulkkinen (antti.pulkkinen@fmi.fi)\n1 Introduction\nRapid geomagnetic variations were first connected with in-\nduction phenomena and electric currents flowing in techno-\nlogical systems on the ground in the mid 1800s. In partic-\nular, geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) were found to\ncause disturbances in the operation of telegraph equipment\n(Barlow, 1849). Since then the number of technological sys-\ntems having long conductors has increased rapidly, and var-\nious networks, such as power transmission systems, buried\npipelines, telecommunication cables and railway signalling\nsystems, have been found to be affected by GIC to varying\ndegrees (e.g. Lanzerotti et al., 1999; Boteler et al., 1998).\nThe basic mechanism producing GIC in conductor sys-\ntems is quite well understood and several models for a de-\ntailed calculation of GIC systems in particular have been de-\nveloped (e.g. Lehtinen and Pirjola, 1985; Pulkkinen et al.,\n2001b; Trichtchenko and Boteler, 2001). In general, GIC are\ndriven by rapid variations of ionospheric currents. At high\nlatitudes, where the most intense GIC are experienced, these\nvariations are thought to be related to the intensification of\nthe electrojets during enhanced ionospheric convection con-\nditions and to the development of the substorm current wedge\nduring geomagnetic substorms.\nModel calculations of GIC information, based on iono-\nspheric current models, about the Earth\u2019s conductivity struc-\nture and on the electrical and geometrical characteristics\nof individual technical systems have been made and corre-\nsponding GIC flowing in different parts of conductor sys-\ntems have been studied (e.g. Viljanen et al., 1999; Favetto\nand Osella, 1999; Kappenman et al., 2000; Pulkkinen et al.,\n2001b). Also, studies have been carried out where the geo-\nelectric field is computed directly from the measured ground\ngeomagnetic field (e.g. Viljanen, 1998). With the availabil-\nity of large geomagnetic databases, these computations have\nbeen able to provide statistical estimations of the likelihood\nof occurrence of GIC in particular systems or regions (e.g.\nLanglois et al., 1996; Pulkkinen et al., 2000, 2001a).\nHowever, despite numerous studies of GIC, there still ex-\n710 A. Pulkkinen et al.: April 2000 storm: ionospheric drivers of large GIC\nFig. 1. IMAGE and SAMNET magnetometer array station locations\n(black dots) and the GIC measurement sites in the Scottish (Hunter-\nston, Neilston, Torness) and Finnish (Rauma, Yllikka\u00a8la\u00a8) power sys-\ntems and in the Finnish natural gas pipeline (Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8) (circles).\nThe approximate spatial coverage of the systems is shown with\nboxes. The westernmost box indicates the Scottish power system,\nthe larger box in the east covers the Finnish power system and the\nsmaller box, the Finnish pipeline.\nists no well-established picture of the detailed structure of\nthe ionospheric currents driving the largest GIC. Some rough\nestimates of the electrojet intensity and morphology dur-\ning GIC events have been carried out (e.g. Ma\u00a8kinen, 1993;\nBolduc et al., 1998, 2000; Boteler, 2001), but no rigorous\nstudy of realistic ionospheric source currents is available.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate a single intense geo-\nmagnetic storm on 6\u20137 April 2000. During this storm, large\nGIC were measured in technological systems, both in Fin-\nland and in Great Britain, thus providing GIC data on a rela-\ntively large spatial scale. By using these GIC data, together\nwith magnetic measurements from IMAGE and SAMNET\nmagnetometer networks, the ionospheric drivers of the large\nGIC during the event are identified and described. In parallel\nwith the present investigation is the study by Huttunen et al.\n(2002), in which the entire Sun-solar wind-magnetosphere-\nionosphere-ground chain was analysed for the same geomag-\nnetic storm. Some of the findings of this study are used to\nlink GIC discussed here to the large-scale solar wind and\nmagnetospheric phenomena.\nIn Sect. 2, we identify data types and sources and the meth-\nods used in the study. Section 3 is devoted to a detailed\nanalysis of the GIC and ionospheric drivers during the April\n2000 storm. In Sect. 4 we relate findings in Sect. 3 to larger\nscale solar wind and magnetospheric dynamics. Finally, in\nSect. 5 we briefly summarise our findings and discuss their\nimplications.\n2 Data sources and analysis methods\nThe geomagnetic data used in the study were obtained from\nthe IMAGE and SAMNET magnetometer networks operat-\ning in the northern part of Europe (Fig. 1). One-minute data\nwere used and a baseline was determined visually for each\nstation before being subtracted from the data to provide the\ndisturbance field. Due to the intensity of the storm, the accu-\nracy of these baselines is not critical.\nGIC measurements were obtained from the Scottish and\nFinnish high-voltage power transmission grids and from the\nFinnish natural gas pipeline network (Fig. 1). Since we are\ninterested only in general features of the GIC related phe-\nnomena, in Fig. 1 we show only the approximate coverage\nof the networks. For a more detailed study of the behaviour\nof GIC in specific systems, the detailed structure of the net-\nworks would need to be considered.\nThe power system GIC are found by measuring the current\nflowing through the neutral line connecting the three phases\nof the power transformer to the ground. Pipeline GIC mea-\nsurements are, in turn, carried out by measuring the magnetic\nfield, caused by the current flowing along the pipeline, right\nabove the pipeline (Pulkkinen et al., 2001a). The GIC record-\nings at the Finnish pipeline commenced in November 1998,\nand thus, data for over 3.5 years exists to date. All GIC data\nwere produced with a ten-second time resolution.\nThe geomagnetic data were investigated by the spheri-\ncal elementary current system (SECS) method (Amm, 1997;\nAmm and Viljanen, 1999). In this approach, the ground\nmagnetic data are converted to ionospheric equivalent cur-\nrent density patterns.\nThe separation of the magnetic field into external and in-\nternal parts was not carried out prior to computation of equiv-\nalent currents. This may result in a slight overestimation of\ncurrent amplitudes (Tanskanen et al., 2001), but will not have\na significant effect on the morphology of current patterns. It\nshould be noted that large spatial gaps in the data result in\nunreliable estimates of equivalent current patterns (for exam-\nple, in the region between Svalbard and the Faeroe Islands).\nHowever, in areas with relatively high spatial density data,\nthe estimates for equivalent currents can be regarded as reli-\nable (Pulkkinen et al., 2002).\nThe error of the fit between the measured magnetic field\nand the magnetic field given by the model at each time step (a\nmeasure indicating the ability of the equivalent current model\nto reproduce the observed fields) is given as a root-mean-\nsquare (rms) error, summed over each magnetometer. The\nmedian rms during the disturbed period (6 April, 16:40 UT\n\u2013 7 April, 04:00 UT) is 8 nT. This is very small, consider-\ning that the amplitudes of geomagnetic variations during the\nevent are several hundreds of nanoteslas.\nIt should be noted that in general, and excluding some spe-\ncial cases (e.g. Untiedt and Baumjohann, 1993), equivalent\ncurrents are not equal to the true 3-D ionospheric current sys-\nA.

In order to solve the true 3-D system, the ionospheric\nelectric field or field-aligned currents over the area need to be\nsupplied (e.g. Amm, 2001). These are not available for the\npresent study. We only have ground magnetic data, which,\nhowever, has a relatively good coverage over the region of\ninterest. In addition, equivalent currents are fully sufficient\nfor the purposes of this study.\nTo examine the characteristics of the electric field at the\nsurface of the Earth, we compute the time derivative of the\nground horizontal magnetic field (dH\/dt , H = X+ Y), to\ngive a reasonable measure of the induction or GIC activity\n(Viljanen et al., 2001). We then rotate the computed dH\/dt\nvectors 90 degrees anticlockwise, to be roughly parallel to\nthe large-scale surface electric field, Esur . Since GIC is\nclosely related to the spatially integrated surface electric field\nin which small-scale (\u223c 1 km) variations are smoothed out,\nand since only the basic structure of the induced field is of\ninterest here, dH\/dt is identified with Esur below.\n3 Drivers of large GIC during the 6\u20137 April 2000 geo-\nmagnetic storm\nBefore analyzing the drivers of large GIC, we need to define\nthe term \u201clarge\u201d. The impact of quasi-dc GIC, for example,\non power system transformers, depends on the magnitude\nand duration of the GIC and on the design, loading and set-up\nof the system (e.g. Kappenman and Albertson, 1990; Lahti-\nnen and Elovaara, 2002). It follows that no general \u201crule of\nthumb\u201d on GIC magnitudes can be easily assigned. However,\naccording to statistics by Pulkkinen et al. (2001a), GIC over\n5 A at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8 station of the Finnish natural gas pipeline\ncan be expected for 100 min per year, when averaged over\nseveral solar cycles. During the 6\u20137 April 2000 storm, GIC\nexceeded 5 A at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8 for a 25-min period.

So we\nmay say that GIC of 5 A are relatively rare at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8 and\nthat 5 A is, therefore, considered our definition of \u201clarge\u201d.\nAlso note that in the Scottish power grid, GIC exceeding 5 A\nhave been observed only a few times since continuous mea-\nsurements began in 2000.\nAt the onset of the storm, at 16:41 UT, the geomagnetic\nsudden commencement (SC) produced a global enhancement\nof the geomagnetic field (Fig. 2) and caused the first large\nGIC both in the UK and Finland (Fig. 3). The amplitude\nof GIC is 2\u20135 A at all the measurement locations and the\nenhancement of the GIC lasts about 5 mins. The Esur pat-\ntern (Fig. 5) shows a coherent west to southwest orientation\nduring the SC (up to 16:40:00\u201316:41:40 UT). Around 16:42\nEsur in Fennoscandia adopts a more north-south orientation,\nbut remains westerly over the UK. Subsequently, a pair of re-\ngions is established in which Esur is driven westward, south\nof the 60 degrees geomagnetic latitude, and eastwards, north\nof 60 degrees geomagnetic latitude. This structure persists\nfor only one minute before reversing in sign. Thereafter,\nthere are a number of intervening periods of north-south\nEsur . By 16:47 UT, when GIC have already dropped, Esur\nbecomes largely irregular over the region. Thus, the first\nimpact is quite coherent across the studied region. This is\nin accordance with the basic SC model of Araki (1994), in\nwhich a global magnetic signature is observed for a few min-\nutes during the passage of the MHD wave produced by the\nimpact of the interplanetary shock. However, the pulse shape\nusually observed during a SC in the magnetic field in the lo-\ncal afternoon is not clearly present.\nAt 18:07 UT large enhancements of GIC are observed at\nthe Finnish stations, with the largest value (20 A) being mea-\n712 A.

The vertical dashed line indicates the time 02:00 UT.\nsured at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8. These GIC coincide with a substorm on-\nset that causes the intensification of the eastward electro-\njet and the penetration of the westward electrojet into the\nFennoscandian region (Fig. 6). Only a couple of minutes af-\nter the intensifications at the Finnish stations, GIC enhance-\nments are also observed in the UK. However, the amplitudes\nof GIC in the UK are roughly half of those observed in Fin-\nland. Presumably this follows from the fact that the east-\nward electrojet is just north of the British Isles and thus, the\nlargest geomagnetic disturbances caused by this substorm\nare not seen in the UK. Prior to 18:07 UT, Esur shows lit-\ntle coherence across northern Europe. Between 18:07 and\n18:09 UT, a localized enhanced Esur is observed to develop\nover Finland and Sweden, between 50 and 60 degrees ge-\nomagnetic latitude. One characteristic is that the orienta-\ntion of the Esur pattern changes rapidly. In the UK, Esur is\nconsistently westwards over this time interval, turning east-\nwards after 18:12 UT. By 18:15 UT, Esur has returned to be-\ning small and irregularly oriented across the whole region.\nLarge Finnish GIC (> 5 A) are observed for a period of ap-\nproximately 6\u20137 min. The period corresponds roughly to the\nintensification of the substorm time electrojets.\nDuring the period 19:50\u201322:00 UT, several GIC enhance-\nments are seen both in the UK and in Finland. Let us con-\ncentrate on events that took place at 20:55 UT and 21:24 UT.\nAt 20:55 UT a westward electrojet enhancement was accom-\npanied by a very local current system in the vicinity of the\nNurmija\u00a8rvi Geophysical Observatory. Although some mag-\nnetic signatures are seen at other IMAGE stations, Esur is\nseveral times larger at Nurmija\u00a8rvi. Thus, the spatial scale of\nthe most intense current system is around 100 km, at most.\n(Unfortunately, a more detailed study of the structure in the\nionosphere is impossible, due to the lack of high spatial den-\nsity data.) This localized current system produced GIC of\n14 A at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8.

Scottish measurements were between 3 A \u2013 4.5\nA and thus clearly above any background noise level. This\nsuggests that intense current changes in the vicinity of Nur-\nmija\u00a8rvi may be embedded in some larger scale changes of\nionospheric currents. GIC above 5 A are observed for one\nminute at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8. At 21:24 UT GIC enhancements are ob-\nserved at the UK stations. This is the only time during the\nentire storm period when large GIC are observed only in the\nUK, with no clear enhancement of GIC at the Finnish sta-\ntions. In terms of equivalent currents, it is the development\nof the westward current above the UK that drives the GIC\n(see Fig. 7). The enhancement of currents above the UK\nis related to the reconfiguration of the westward electrojet\nabove the IMAGE chain. This is seen from Fig. 8, where\nthe difference of equivalent currents at 21:23 and 21:26 UT\nis shown, and where, apart from a region above the north of\nthe UK, an enhancement of equivalent currents is also ob-\nserved above southern Finland (at about 60\u25e6 N). In addition,\na change in currents is observed in quite a narrow region in\ncentral Fennoscandia (at about 65\u25e6 N). This is a configura-\ntion which itself is quite interesting. A similar small-scale\ncurrent structure roughly at the same latitude is discussed by\nUntiedt and Baumjohann (1993, p. 333\u2013334), who noted that\nsuch structures are often associated with field-aligned current\nregions. GIC above 4 A are observed for about 1\u20132 min at the\nScottish stations.\nA.

Changes in the amplitude of\nthe electrojet at 23:05\u201323:13 UT (Fig. 9) causes a smooth\nwestward GIC of 5 A at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8. It is quite remarkable\nthat no similar smooth GIC is observed at any other station.\nThis can be explained by looking at the Esur pattern for the\ncorresponding period from which we see that Esur remains\nbroadly westward only at the vicinity of Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8, until about\n23:12 UT, after which it becomes as variable as in the vicin-\nity of the other GIC measurement sites, with a corresponding\ndecline in current magnitudes. GIC above 2 A is observed\nfor 2\u20133 min at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8.\nAt 23:15 UT a large substorm onset takes place. The ini-\ntial magnetic disturbance at the Earth\u2019s surface propagates\nnorthward, which is a typical feature of substorms (e.g. Ros-\ntoker, 1996). Propagation can be easily seen from Fig. 10,\nin which the time derivatives of the north component of the\nmagnetic field at some of the SAMNET and IMAGE sta-\ntions are shown. The time derivative behaves very irregu-\nlarly and indicates that even during clearly identifiable sub-\nstorm events, when the intensity of the westward electro-\njet sharply increases, large contributions to GIC come from\nthe small and rapidly changing currents superimposed on the\nelectrojet. Esur patterns (Fig. 11) switch to a more predomi-\nnantly eastward direction during the intervals of strong GIC\noccurring across northern Europe. However, rapid orienta-\ntion swings also remain, particularly over the UK during this\ntime. The largest GIC are observed during the expansion\nphase of the substorm, with peak values varying between 23\nA (Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8) and 5 A (Torness).

However, oscillations of\nthe decreasing westward electrojet and smaller scale current\nsystems cause large GIC at Finnish and UK stations during\nthe rest of the day.\nAt the beginning of 7 April, the geomagnetic storm has\npassed its main phase. Southern Finland and northern UK\nare under an enhanced westward electrojet. Variations of the\nelectrojet cause large GIC in these areas throughout the pe-\nriod 00:00\u201301:30 UT (Fig. 4). What is of interest to note is\nthat, according to Huttunen et al. (2002), the only clear sub-\nstorm of the period is seen at 00:30 UT. However, the effect\nof this substorm does not appear clearly in GIC measure-\nments. Equally large, or larger GIC are observed during other\ntimes between 00:00 and 01:30 UT. The westward electrojet\nmoves a few degrees northward after 01:00 UT, which causes\nGIC at UK stations to decrease ahead of GIC at Finnish sta-\ntions. Esur is largely eastward over Finland and Scotland for\na few minutes following 00:35 UT and again, to a lesser ex-\ntent, after 00:41 UT. Otherwise, the electric field orientation\nis strongly variable between east and west in these regions.\nIn the UK a westward Esur is established for a few minutes\naround 01:02 UT, driving currents of a few amps, before turn-\ning northwards again. The largest GIC of the period are mea-\nsured at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8, where several peaks exceeding the 10 A\nare observed.

Pc5 pulsations are thought to be produced by solar\nwind driven field line resonances that occur at higher lati-\ntudes (e.g. Chisham and Orr, 1997). The amplitudes of the\npulsations decrease towards the south and thus, they create\nlarger GIC at the Finnish stations, with the largest ampli-\ntudes (2.5 A) located again at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8. Despite the appar-\nent coherency of the magnetic signal caused by pulsations,\nthere are no large-scale structures in Esur that behave co-\nherently across the whole region at any point between 02:00\nand 04:00 UT. Local structures are seen (for example, on the\nscale of the UK, or of Fennoscandia, north of 60 degrees ge-\nomagnetic), with a tendency for neighboring Esur vectors to\nchange from west to east or conversely regularly over the\ntime frame. Reversals in the direction of Esur can take 5\u2013\n10 min to accomplish and Esur remains in the new orienta-\ntion for a similar time. At the very end of the storm event,\nan increase in GIC at all stations is observed between 03:25\u2013\n03:55 UT, perhaps due to an increase in the amplitude of pul-\nsations, or due to the appearance of some other current sys-\ntem superimposed on currents associated with the pulsations.\nThe largest amplitude GIC (6.5 A) is observed at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8.\n4 Discussion\nWe have described in detail characteristics of large GIC\nand corresponding ionospheric equivalent current systems\nand ground electric fields during the 6\u20137 April 2001 mag-\nnetic storm.

The discussion\nis based mainly on the results by Huttunen et al. (2002),\nwho investigated this storm from the viewpoint of the Sun-\nsolar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere-ground chain. Some\nof their key results, which have relevance for our study, are\nsummarized below.\nOn 4 April 2000, a coronal mass ejection (CME) was ob-\nserved to leave the Sun. Although the ejecta was not believed\nto be directly earthward, the sheath region between the shock\nfront and the driver gas hit the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, caus-\ning the largest geomagnetic storm of 2000, as measured by\nthe low-latitude Dst index. The shock impact was observed\nat 16:40 UT at geostationary orbit on the dayside. Solar wind\nplasma conditions, namely strongly negative and fluctuating\nIMF and high dynamic pressure in the sheath region behind\nthe shock produced strongly driven magnetospheric activity.\nSeveral ionospheric activations occurred all around the au-\nroral oval during the storm. Four of these activations, iden-\ntified from the IMAGE data, showed substorm-like behav-\nior (18:05, 20:13, 23:15, 00:30 UT, poleward and westward\nexpansion of the nightside ionospheric current system, ac-\ncompanied by particle injections observed at geostationary\norbit in the midnight region) and were thus related to the re-\nlease of the energy stored in the magnetotail. The cause of\nthe increased energy storage during the storm was the strong\ndriving caused by the negative Bz and the high pressure of\nthe solar wind. Four other activations (17:08, 19:10, 20:55,\n22:16 UT) were related to the expansion of the ionospheric\ncurrent system but clear particle injections were missing. It\nwas suggested by Huttunen et al. (2002) that the first set of\nA.

Most notably, during the intensification\nat 23:15 UT, the expansion of substorm related ionospheric\ncurrents from lower latitudes towards the north caused a\nsweep of the ionospheric region. This caused large GIC prac-\ntically throughout northern Europe.\nLocalized small-scale features were one of the main char-\nacters of the storm period. In general, it was seen that al-\nthough the presence of the auroral electrojet favored large\nGIC, the actual reason for GIC were small-scale features\nin the ionosphere. In other words, usually |X| \u001d |Y | but\n|dX\/dt | \u2248 |dY\/dt |, which can be explained only by small-\nscale variations in the source currents. The duration of in-\ndividual GIC spikes was short (a few minutes) and Esur\npatterns were changing rapidly and were inhomogeneous as\nwell, which is in accordance with the results by Viljanen et\nal. (2001), who studied the statistical behavior of the time\nderivatives of the ground magnetic field. From the sub-\nstorm\u2019s point of view, this type of behavior is quite expected,\ntaking into account the turbulent nature of the phenomenon\n(e.g. Klimas et al., 2000).\nStrong driving of the magnetospheric activity causes the\nauroral oval to expand towards lower latitudes. At such\ntimes, variations in ionospheric currents (electrojets) can\ncause large GIC at latitudes where GIC is not typically ex-\nperienced. An example can be seen at 21:24 UT, when the\nelectrojet above the UK embodies variations in currents that\ncause large GIC at Scottish stations, while Finnish stations\n-12\u02da\n-12\u02da\n-8\u02da\n-8\u02da\n-4\u02da\n-4\u02da\n0\u02da\n0\u02da\n4\u02da\n4\u02da\n8\u02da\n8\u02da\n12\u02da\n12\u02da\n16\u02da\n16\u02da\n20\u02da\n20\u02da\n24\u02da\n24\u02da\n28\u02da\n28\u02da\n32\u02da\n32\u02da\n36\u02da\n36\u02da\n51\u02da 51\u02da\n54\u02da 54\u02da\n57\u02da 57\u02da\n60\u02da 60\u02da\n63\u02da 63\u02da\n66\u02da 66\u02da\n69\u02da 69\u02da\n72\u02da 72\u02da\n50 deg\n55 deg\n60 deg\n65 deg\n70 de\ng\nContours are Corrected Geomagnetic Latitude\n06\/04\/2000\n8nT\/sec\ndH\/dt\nrotated -90 degrees\nGICs\n1 Amp to Earth\n1 Amp from Earth\n23:22:20 UT\nMAX GIC = 22 A\nFig. 11.

For ex-\nample, at 20:55 UT substorm onset type intensification was\nobserved at magnetometer stations. However, as was ex-\nplained above, due to the missing signature of particle injec-\ntions at geostationary orbit, its morphology is distinct from\nthe classical substorm event. Thus, corresponding large lo-\ncalized GIC at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8 cannot be accounted for by sub-\nstorms, but perhaps by some finer structure behavior of the\nmagnetosphere that was directly driven by the solar wind, as\nsuggested by Huttunen et al. (2002). In addition, the geo-\nmagnetic sudden commencement (SC) caused by the intense\nshock related pressure pulse in the solar wind was seen to\ncause GIC on a large spatial scale. Shock fronts are often\nassociated with intense geomagnetic storms (e.g. Tsurutani\nand Gonzalez, 1997) and thus, SCs are one important type\nof reason for storm related GIC. SC preceding the magnetic\nstorm on 24 March 1991 caused one of the largest ever ob-\nserved GIC (175 A) in the Finnish power system (Viljanen\nand Pirjola, 1994). On 7 April solar wind directly driven ge-\nomagnetic pulsations in the local morning region caused a\nsequence of large GIC. According to Viljanen et al. (2001),\nlocal morning is one of the time sectors where large ground\nmagnetic variations (and large Esur ) are typically observed.\nThese variations can possibly be partly explained by pulsa-\ntions. It should be noted that although the amplitude of the\npulsation related GIC were smaller than during substorms,\n716 A.

Statistical occurrence of GIC above 2.5 A in the Finnish\npipeline. Counts computed for each UT sector correspond to the\nnumber of measured 10-s values of GIC above 2.5 A. Statistics are\nderived using data from November 1998 to May 2002.\nthe long duration (approx. 02:00\u201304:30 UT) of the event may\ngive rise, for example, to cumulative corrosion effects expe-\nrienced by buried pipelines (e.g. Martin, 1993).\nTo investigate how the GIC driver dynamics discussed\nabove relate to the statistical picture, we computed the statis-\ntical occurrence of GIC above 2.5 A (GIC above 5 A has oc-\ncurred too rarely for statistical considerations) in the Finnish\npipeline. Statistics were computed for each UT sector, re-\nvealing the times when large GIC are typically observed.\nFinnish local time is UT + 2 hours. The result is an updated\nversion of the data of Viljanen et al. (2001), where now data\nfrom November 1998 to May 2002 are used. In Fig. 12 it can\nbe seen that two clearly distinguishable peaks are present:\none in the vicinity of the local midnight, another in the local\nmorning sector. It is known that the most dramatic changes in\nionospheric currents during substorms happen in the vicinity\nof local midnight, and thus, one is tempted to propose that\nsubstorms are also in a statistical sense the most important\ncause for large GIC in the auroral regions. Correspondingly,\nit is known that many classes of auroral region ULF waves,\nlike Pc5s, are favored at the local morning region (e.g. Ven-\nnerstr\u00f8m, 1999), which was also observed during the April\n2000 storm. Thus, it may be that pulsations are the second\nlargest category of cause for large GIC.\nSummarizing, clearly identifiable ionospheric drivers of\nlarge GIC during the 6\u20137 April 2000 geomagnetic storm\nwere related to (1) the SSC at the beginning of the storm,\n(2) pulsations at the end of the storm, (3) substorm onsets\nduring the storm. In addition, various small-scale, although\nnot easily classifiable, features were observed to cause large\nGIC. Statistical considerations suggested that substorms and\npulsations are the most typical cause of large GIC at the au-\nroral region.\n5 Conclusions\nAlthough most of the very largest GIC during the April 2000\nstorm were clearly related to substorm intensifications, a con-\nclusion supported also by the statistics, there were no com-\nmon characteristics in the substorm behavior that could be\nassociated with all the large GIC. For example, both very\nlocalized ionospheric current structures and relatively large-\nscale, propagating structures were observed during individ-\nual peak GIC. Only during the sudden commencement at the\nbeginning of the event where there large-scale coherent GIC\nand surface electric fields across northern Europe. A typical\nduration of the peak GIC was generally quite short, typically\nvarying between 2\u201315 min.\nIn light of the present study, one key issue, related to the\npossibility of GIC forecasting in the auroral regions, is the\npredictability of substorms. For this, the time of onset and\nthe location of ionospheric current intensifications need to\nbe known. If these characteristics are given with a sufficient\naccuracy, regional GIC warnings may be given with a relia-\nbility that might be acceptable to potential space weather cus-\ntomers. However, it is clear that for the moment accurate GIC\npredictions, where the behavior of GIC at individual sites is\ncomputed, are not possible with the present knowledge. The\ndynamics of ionospheric currents have been shown to be too\ncomplex for existing predictive methods to cope with.\nAlthough individual case studies, such as those presented\nhere, provide a good basis for understanding basic processes\ncausing large GIC, a more general classification, using a\nlarger database, is required. This will allow a more quan-\ntitative statement of the relative importance of the different\nionospheric events producing large ground effects. Such a\nclassification will be one of our goals in future GIC studies.\nAs a start, the more recent 15\u201316 July 2000 magnetic storm\nwill be of special interest, due to the extremely large GIC\nobserved in Europe.\nAcknowledgements.
