GIS are applied in a\nwide range of organizations and disciplines, including central and local government,\nenvironmental agencies, transport planning and vehicle navigation, education and\nresearch, utilities management, resource management, and the financial and retail sectors.\nGIS is a field of constantly changing technology, and it has been recognized that GIS\neducation needs to be more than a 'once in a lifetime' event (Muller, 1993). Consequently,\nGIS teachers have developed computer-based materials for learners at all levels, from\nschool students to postgraduates, and for the independent professional updating their\nskills and knowledge. To date, these materials have followed a number of approaches.\nInitially demonstrations of GIS software and its capabilities addressed the need to increase\nawareness of GIS and its applications (DoE, 1987). Arcdemo (Green, 1987) was an\ninnovative early example, providing a demonstration of the software package Arc\/Info on-\n33\nSarah Cornelius and Ian Heywood An interactive learning environment in Geographical Information Systems\nline. Training in particular software, and the need for hands-on experience, have been\naddressed with the production of software-specific educational materials which use\nprimarily traditional text-based instructions for exercises with specially prepared data.\nExamples include Getting started in GIS (Langford, 1993), the Unitar workbooks for Idrisi\n(for example McKendry et al, 1992) and Understanding GIS: the Arc\/Info Method (ESRI,\n1990). These have proved particularly popular, and by directing learners through\nstructured exercises allow new users to become familiar with complex software in a\nrelatively short time. More recently, they have migrated to CD-ROM, with training\nmaterials such as Getting to know Arcview (ESRI, 1995) provided in this format, and\ncombining software, data and demonstrations.\nHowever, the learning path in most of these cases is prescribed, and individual exploration of\nthe software and data restricted. More interactive tools for the delivery of a broader GIS\ncurriculum include GISTutor, the commercially successful computer-based tutorial\ndeveloped by Raper and Green (1992). GISTutor is completely independent of GIS software,\noffering animation of some operations, and illustrations of others as a tutorial and reference\nresource. This interactive GIS Encyclopedia does not attempt to manage or structure learning,\nand the lack of colour graphics is a drawback. More recent computer-based tutorials include\nSITE (Spatial Information Tutorial Environment), which offers structured routes through a\ntutorial hosted on a Unix workstation (Wood and Langford, 1993), and the prototype Color\nyour World (Sutton and Van Zuyle, 1994) which aims to teach political geography while\nfamiliarizing school students with GIS. The latter uses a computer games approach.\nIn the field of professional education the use of tutorials and emulators is becoming more\ncommon. Computer-based tutors specific to certain topics and software products are\nemerging. For example, in GIS, tutorials for Arc\/Info and Idrisi software are accessible via\nthe Internet (ESRI, 1996; Lorup, 1996). These still require users to have access to the\nsoftware themselves. Perceiving the difficulty of providing a whole class with expensive\nhigh technology equipment, the US Defense Mapping School have created an innovative\ntutorial and simulation system for a related technology, the Global Positioning System\n(GPS) (Thompson, 1996).\nMost of these learning tools can be categorized as computer-aided instruction. They offer\ncontrolled exploration of the data and resources, with limited opportunities for feedback\nand discussion. While this may suit the situation of the learners they are designed for,\nwhich is normally a classroom situation with tutors on hand to assist, there is also a need\nfor computer-managed learning tools for the mature GIS learner, based at home or work,\nand studying alone. The GPS training package (Thompson, 1996) may also go some way to\nmeeting the needs of professional updaters, and has been designed to fit onto 3.5 inch\nfloppy disks so that learners can take a copy home as a reference source.\nMany suggestions have been made for improving computer-based tutors and instructors.\nThompson (1996) looks forward to the inclusion of full multimedia audio and video in the\nGPS tutor, hampered at present by the resources available to his students. He also sees the\nfinal goal of the system as allowing students with no background in the subject to train\nthemselves in the use the technology. One problem noted is the need for constant updates\nin a continually evolving technology. In more general terms, Harrison (1993) stresses the\nneed for computer-based tutorials to 'delight the student' since they can be 'inflexible,\n34\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nunadaptive and tiresome'. Gold et al (1991) identify a role for Intelligent Tutoring Systems\nwhich overcome the primitive nature of much computer-based instructional material, and\nhelp the learner to identify and treat learning difficulties and to adjust to different levels of\nknowledge. There have also been calls for CAL materials that allow learners more control\nover their learning, both in style and content. Clarke (1993) divides learners into those who\nprefer structured, guided instruction, and those who seek unstructured discovery learning.\nHe offers these two extremes as models for the development of CAL materials that allow\nstudents to choose how they wish to learn.\nThe experiences of Unigis, providing postgraduate distance-learning courses in GIS since\n1992, has shown that learners on their own at home face particular difficulties with\ncomputer-based learning resources, since problems cannot be solved by the simple raising\nof a hand in a classroom or by a knock on the tutor's door. Feedback, communication and\nefficiency are important factors affecting motivation and learning for distant students, and\nlearning packages must be appropriate to the resources they have available. These issues\nhave guided the design of the Unigis Learning Station, a multimedia computer-managed\nlearning package.\nThe context for the Unigis multimedia Learning Station\nUnigis is an international network of universities offering postgraduate diploma and MSc\ncourses in GIS which are based on a common curriculum, adapted and translated to meet\nlocal student needs. The students on Unigis courses are mainly mid-career professionals\nfrom the whole range of GIS application areas. In mid-1996 there were over 300 students\nregistered on Unigis courses, making this one of the largest programmes of GIS education\nworld-wide. To meet the needs of Unigis students, careful attention has been given to\nmethods and procedures for course delivery, feedback and assessment. There are special\nproblems involved with the delivery of such a technical and practical subject as GIS by\ndistance learning, and from the outset there was some scepticism as to whether the course\nwould succeed. Full details of the course, including an evaluation of strengths and\nweaknesses to date can be found elsewhere (Reeve et al, 1993; Reeve et al, 1994; Petch et al,\n1994). The course curriculum is outlined briefly below in order to provide the context for\nthe design of the Learning Station.\nThe Unigis curriculum is designed around the theme of database and GIS project design\nand management. The aim is to provide the skills and knowledge necessary to be a\nsuccessful GIS manager, not to train GIS technicians who may need to be competent in\nseveral programming languages and a range of GIS systems. Muller (1993) highlighted the\nneglect of the management component of GIS education and the need for personnel with\nan appreciation of the human factors of GIS. The course hopes to address this need by the\ninclusion of topics such as system design and management and the organizational impacts\nof GIS, in addition to more technical subject areas.\nA series of modules, designed to be studied in sequence, make up the basic diploma course.\nThese have recently been reviewed, following five years of operation of the course, and are\noutlined in Table 1.\nThis basic model has been developed to meet local needs, with international partners\nadapting exercises for local students and offering support in different languages. In the\n35\nSarah Come\/ius and Ian Heywood An interactive learning environment in Geographical Information Systems\nUnit 1\nUnit 2\nUnit 3\nUnit 4\nUnit 5\n(Any two from the list may be\nchosen.

Each one\nincorporates notes, reading materials, activities and exercises of various types. Activities\nand exercises may be computer-based since all students are required to have access to GIS\nand database software. They may include browsing through a computer-based storyboard\nor the manipulation of data in a database. Self-assessed exercises are provided for active\nlearning and for revision at the end of major sections of text. Tutor-assessed exercises are\nalso a part of each module, and these may involve report or essay writing, data analysis or\nanother appropriate activity. Assessment is entirely by coursework. Module materials are\ncomprehensively updated with each new intake of students.\nOptional residential workshops are available as an introduction to the course and for\nadditional hands-on experience and group activities, as well as interaction and discussion\nwith other students and staff. Students also receive a comprehensive set of administrative\ninformation which includes a course study guide, a course handbook (containing\ntimetables, staff profiles, course regulations, etc.), intermittent course newsletters, and\nother relevant material. Currently these documents exist in paper form and are sent to\nstudents by mail.\nThe design of the Unigis Learning Station\nThe previous section indicates that there is currently a mix of textual and multimedia\nmaterials used for course delivery, a substantial body of information that requires regular\nupdating, and materials which can be easily computerized. Users require non-linear access\nto course information, and have the skills and the resources to access and use computer-\nbased resources. Thus, the course meets some of the criteria used for the evaluation,\noffered by Woodhead (1991), of whether a hypertext tutorial package is appropriate in a\ngiven learning situation which can be directly applied to multimedia. As a further\njustification for the adoption of a multimedia computer-based learning resource, the use of\nenabling technologies such as hypertext allow teaching to be more easily matched with\n36\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nlearning style (Ellis et al, 1993), which, in turn, improves motivation for learning,\nhighlighted earlier as an important consideration for a distance-learning course. Initially,\ndiscussions among the course teaching team identified a range of issues for the Learning\nStation to address. Six of these are outlined below.\nTechnology training\nThe course requires a wide range of information-technology skills, including familiarity\nwith operating systems, how to start and use the course software, and how to load and run\ndata sets and storyboards. For students who are relatively new to information technology,\nthis may be a steep learning curve, particularly given the range of interfaces found in GIS\nand related software. The Learning Station helps to overcome some of these initial\nproblems by using a straightforward interface. The need for clear and consistent interfaces\nfor computer-based learning materials in GIS has been recognized (Wood and Langford,\n1994), and there are comprehensive guidelines which can be adopted (for example Clarke,\n1992) to help provide an appropriate interface. However, the Learning Station interface\ndoes not discourage students from finding their own way around course GIS and database\nsoftware, and running these as separate packages.\nIsolation\nDistance-learning students can feel isolated and demotivated. To address issues of\nisolation and support, the Learning Station promotes electronic mail links with the course\nteam and other students. A help facility in the Learning Station, which includes the\ndispatch of email queries directly to the course team or peers, is planned, and this will\nencourage communication and assist the provision of a fast help-line service. Digital\nversions of course documentation are already available, offering rapid easy-to-access help.\nEncouragement to use electronic communications for the diploma will also benefit\nstudents going on to undertake independent Masters research projects by allowing access\nto the Internet, library catalogues, and tutors and experts. The social support, help with\nwork scheduling and opportunities for professional networking offered by computer\nconferencing are now recognized as important supplements to the academic support such a\nsystem can offer (Hartley et al, 1991).\nManagement of course materials\nTo assist students with the management of their learning, and to ensure the efficient use of\nstudy time, a third aspect which the Learning Station addresses is the management of\ncourse materials and personal progress monitoring. This includes, for instance, functions\nto automatically load new exercises and storyboards. Thus, each module should arrive with\nnew data which can be added into the Learning Station. This offers advantages for\nacademic staff, since student progress can be controlled by the distribution of modules in\nsequence. For students, the repeated loading of separate data sets, exercises and\nstoryboards with each new module is simplified, and data can be deleted once they have\nbeen finished with. To help with the management of assessments, the Learning Station\nprovides a common framework for assessments, and should, in future, allow students to\ncheck the completeness of submitted work. Where computer-based materials are required\nfor submission, the Learning Station could assist with the preparation of these (by\nfacilitating, for example, copying to disk, checking for completeness, or the emailing of\nresults to academic staff).\n37\nSarah Cornelius and Ion Heywood An interactive learning environment in Geographical Information Systems\nFeedback and assessment\nFeedback and assessment are paramount with a distance-learning course where contact\nwith tutors is necessarily limited. Instant feedback is particularly difficult, other than by\nthe inclusion of answers for self-check tests and exercises within modules. To increase the\nopportunities for students to obtain feedback on their progress, computer-marked tests are\nincluded in the Learning Station. These enable students to secure faster feedback on\nlearning and problems as they work through the modules. Where problems are identified,\nsuggestions for further reading, or pointers to appropriate sections in the course texts can\nbe included. The Learning Station also provides students with the ability to track\nsubmission dates and record grades for tutor-assessed assignments, enabling progress to be\nmonitored throughout the course.\nLearning resources\nLearning resources are an issue, since libraries, databases and literature are out of reach for\nmany distance-learning students. The Learning Station offers links to a range of additional\nstudy materials to help the creation of an effective integrated study environment. These\ninclude a comprehensive reference database, glossaries and indexes, the course newsletters\nand technical help guides for course software. Instead of a range of paper documents and\ncomputer databases, the Learning Station allows access to all of these, and links between\nthem as appropriate. Access to resources available through the Internet (such as up-to-date\ndiscussions of GIS topics, data, standards documents and other information difficult to\ncome by in such a fast moving discipline) and through electronic communications provide\nadditional learning opportunities.\nVirtual workshops\nReeve et al (1994) recognized that the original requirement to attend residential workshops\nwas a deterrent to some overseas applicants, and the course has now been reviewed to\nmake such workshops optional. This is seen as a problem for some students, limiting\nopportunities fof face-to-face contact with staff and other students, and for group\nworking. However, some of the current workshop activities and materials would be\nsuitable for inclusion in the multimedia Learning Station. For example, audio tapes of\ndiscussions with guest experts and video-conferencing sessions could address the\nworkshops' original aim to expand input from professionals in the GIS field, and the\npromotion of discussion between students and experts. Exercises and tutorials, including\nthose designed for group participation, can be addressed through the Learning Station\nwith electronic communication links providing for group discussion and sharing of data\nand ideas. Heywood and Reeve (1995) address these issues further.\nThe above list is, in part, still a wish list, since some of the functions required are currently\ntechnically challenging, and would create a Learning Station which would not run on the\naverage home-based computer. So, through questionnaire surveys, feedback sessions at\nworkshops and informal contact, the Unigis-students have helped the course staff to\nidentify four main functions for the Learning Station which are the focus of the original\ndesign of the system and the discussion which follows. These four roles are:\n\u2022 Adviser - the system should be capable of providing advice on practical matters\nincluding hardware requirements, common software problems and academic matters\nsuch as course regulations;\n38\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\n\u2022 Informer - the system should provide easy access to up-to-date information such as\ncourse newsletters, deadlines for assessed work and dates of workshops;\n\u2022 Assessor - the system should give immediate feedback on learning and provide self-\nassessment opportunities; and\n\u2022 Tutor - the system should provide access to software tutors, demonstrations of new\ntopics and access to 'real-life' tutors.\nConstruction and development of the Learning Station\nThe Learning Station is regarded as a learning management tool, not simply an instructor\nor computer-based tutor. Thus, using the definition of computer-managed learning\nprovided by Gold et al (1991), it is software that aims to manage both conventional and\ncomputer-based learning. This is achieved by linking computer-based instruction tools,\nGIS and database software, communications software and specifically developed tools for\nthe management and structuring of learning. These are designed to be used in conjunction\nwith the paper text. The Learning Statiftn is not designed to be a multimedia version of the\nmodules already produced in paper form. It is a semi-structured, managed, learning\nenvironment that allows students control, flexibility in approach and the ability to monitor\ntheir own progress.\nThe framework for the Learning Station has been constructed using Multimedia ToolBook\nCBT. One of the criteria for development has been that the Learning Station should run on\na relatively low specification PC under Windows. However, recognizing the rapid develop-\nments in telecommunications, and the decreasing cost of PC hardware, the development\nenvironment has had to be able to take advantage of future enhancements in these areas.\nMost current students do not have access to a modem and the Internet, so the Learning\nStation has to offer all that is necessary to complete the course, including administrative\ninformation, exercises and access to software and databases. If communications are\navailable, then access to Internet resources exist. Material is organized in two main\nsections: the Information Guide, and the Module Guide. A help system, including\nLearning Station tutorial and navigation map, are also provided.\nGiven the high standard of many existing CAL resources in GIS, it is part of the Unigis\nphilosophy to include these where possible and appropriate as part of the tutor role for the\nLearning Station. Thus, links to existing resources produced by Unigis team members\n(such as a map algebra tutorial produced by Josef Strobl and a 'House Hunting' game\nproduced by members of the UK team) have been developed. Links to other external\nresources, such as the Idrisi tutorial package Getting Started in GIS (Langford, 1993), the\nMicrosoft Windows tutorial and a range of GIS demonstrations produced by other third\nparties, are provided. However, it is important that such links remain easy to change since\ndemonstrations and exercises date quickly as software changes.\nThe Learning Station uses a variety of different software tools including hypertext,\nanimation, interactive question and answer software, commercial GIS and database\nsoftware and communications software. Hypertext has been used for many aspects of the\nInformer and Advisor roles required, including the presentation of course guides,\nhandbooks and help systems. The inclusion of the complete module texts as hypertext\n39\nSarah Cornelius and Ian Heywood An interactive learning environment in Geographical Information Systems\ndocuments is a development option. However, this is not favoured by the majority of\nstudents who prefer paper notes which can be studied and annotated at any location.\nSummary details for each module are, however, included. Animation is a useful tool for the\ndemonstration of complex and time-consuming GIS operations, as has been demonstrated\nby GISTutor (Raper and Green, 1992). In the Learning Station, it has been used for\ntutorial and storyboard type displays of operations that are not effectively illustrated on\npaper. ToolBook has been used to construct a set of self-check questions of a multiple-\nchoice and short-answer nature. These are ideal for self-assessment exercises and provide\nimmediate feedback and suggestions for further work where problems are identified. With\nthe paper versions of the module, this type of feedback was missing, and this meets the\nneed for an assessor role for the Learning Station suggested earlier. Access (Microsoft),\ndBase (Ashton Tate), Idrisi (Clarke University) and Arcview (ESRI) are currently used by\nUnigis. The Learning Station provides links to these where they are required for the\nvisualization of case-study data sets and for the completion of exercises or assessments.\nInitially a pilot Learning Station was produced for one module, half-way through the\ncourse. Material was then developed for all course modules. A typical module includes:\n(i) Automatic loading of exercises and data from disks which arrive with paper-based\nmaterials.\n(ii) Self-assessed exercises. A variety of approaches to multiple choice questions have been\nimplemented to elicit comment from users as to which suit their learning styles most\neffectively.\n(iii) Computer-based tutorials. For example, a short tutorial offering animation of common\nmap algebra functions in raster GIS has been adapted from a German language\ntutorial written by Josef Strobl. This supplements static text-based diagrams very\neffectively.\n(iv) Annotated stories and virtual lectures. Slide shows of computer screens illustrating\ncase-study data sets, referred to within the text, offer substantial advantages over\npaper-based reproductions of images. In a similar way, virtual lectures, supplementary\nnotes and diagrams and self-check tests written to supplement module and workshop\nmaterials have been included.\n(v) Tutor-assessed exercises. Details are annotated with the help of icons into aims and\nobjectives, deliverables and methods sections. Over the paper text these have the\nadvantage of added visual impact, and direct access to the data and software required,\nincluding word-processing software for report writing.\n(vi) Supplementary learning resources. These may include sample Internet pages or\nsuggested Internet sites for exploration. The Learning Station also offers access to a\ncomprehensive reference database that has been compiled by course staff.\nFuture developments for the Learning Station include the creation of a more\ncomprehensive virtual classroom. Virtual lectures, including notes, diagrams and self-check\ntests have already been provided, and the idea of a virtual workshop, involving\ncollaborative problem-solving and multimedia presentations has been explored (Reeve and\nHeywood, 1995).\n40\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nEvaluation of the Learning Station\nTwo cohorts of UK based students have been surveyed using a comprehensive\nquestionnaire addressing resources available to the students, use of the Learning Station,\nattitudes to the Learning Station and learning styles. Results from the evaluation are\npresented as follows:\nGroup A - These students supplied initial impressions of the Learning Station. Group A\nconsisted of representatives from two separate cohorts of students. First, there was a\nsample of students from one cohort who were exposed to the Learning Station mid-way\nthrough the course where it was presented as a development in course materials. Also in\nGroup A were a second set of respondents from a second cohort who evaluated the system\nafter completing the first module.\nGroup B- These students were more familiar with the Learning Station. Group B consisted\nof students from the second cohort surveyed, re-surveyed mid-way through the course.\nComments from Group A were mixed, although the majority were in favour of the system,\nand those not provided with the Learning Station at the start of the course commented\nthat it would have been useful to have the system available throughout. In total, 21 students\nprovided full feedback as part of Group A. All of these had used a computer prior to the\ncourse (predominantly for word processing). Over 40 per cent obtained a computer\n(usually a 486) for the course. Over 90 per cent felt that the Learning Station could become\nan essential part of the course, and more than 60 per cent felt that it encouraged greater\nautonomy and self-direction in their learning. Over 60 per cent disagreed with the\nstatement that the Learning Station was a gimmick. The feedback from the students is\nconsidered in terms of the four roles identified for the Learning Station.\n(i) Adviser - about 50 per cent of the students used the Learning Station to access\ninformation from the course handbook, and other technical information (particularly\ninformation on communications and the Internet). Some respondents felt that more\ndetails were required in these areas.\n(ii) Informer - again, about half of the students used the Learning Station in this role. They\nlooked particularly for recommended texts, the newsletter and dates of deadlines and\nworkshops. They commented that information provided should be up to date and\nrelevant, and suggested that tutors should provide regular updates. They wanted to see a\nfull reference database and to have, if possible, direct access to reading materials. They\nfelt that the Learning Station helped make information easily and readily accessible.\n(iii) Assessor - the students surveyed used the Learning Station most frequently for\nundertaking self-assessment exercises. They found these exercises easy to use, and felt\nthe system improved the learning process. Less, just under half, felt that the Learning\nStation provided helpful feedback or information on progress.\n(iv) Tutor\/motivator - the Learning Station offered interactive demonstrations and slide\nshows to illustrate some of the more graphical elements of GIS, and case studies.\nStudents felt these were useful backups to the text, although in places they felt that\nmore details would have been useful.\nRespondents were also asked about positive and negative aspects of the Learning Station.\n41\nSarah Cornelius and Ian Heywood An interactive learning environment in Geographical Information Systems\nIn general the positive points included easy access to course material and software,\ngraphical shows and visual presentation of material to back up issues covered in the paper\ntext. The self-assessed exercises again scored highly. Several individuals commented on the\npositive aspects for learning. For example, it was suggested that the Learning Station\nprovides an alternative source of study - 'a change is as good as a rest' - and that the\nLearning Station assisted learning by doing and provided motivation for learning.\nNegative points and suggestions for developments focused on technical problems, and\ninterestingly, the problems of reading text on-screen. Some students had faced technical\nproblems with the setting up of the systems on particular machines. They requested a Print\nScreen facility and full help system. In addition, the need to read large chunks of text from\nthe computer screen was felt to be far from ideal - the font used was criticized, as was the\nnature of the presentation, particularly the use of windows with scroll options. One user\ncommented that the system made it impossible to browse through text, but required the\nreader to wait for the computer. Others were concerned about the fact that they did not\nwant to spend more time in front of the computer screen.\nGroup B, consisting primarily of the same students surveyed half-way through the course,\noffered an interesting re-evaluation of the Learning Station once they had had time to fully\nassess its role in the course. Twenty-six students provided feedback on Modules 3, 4 or 5;\nmost were working at the time, and all were attendees at a residential workshop. Figures 1\nand 2 give an indication of the amount of time these students have devoted to using the\nLearning Station. For the first three modules, the Learning Station was used most often for\nbetween one and five hours. For module 4, which was completed by a smaller number of\nstudents (hence the high zero-hours use category), the amount of time being spent with the\nLearning Station increased to 6-10 hours. This may be due to the nature of this module,\nwhich involves extended work with the computer, and if software used is accessed through\nthe Learning Station rather than directly from the operating system, this would put the\noverall time of use up much higher than for previous modules.\nThe roles of the Learning Station - Advisor, Informer, Assessor and Tutor - again make a\ngood framework for evaluation of the use of the system:\n(i) Adviser - 58 per cent of the students used the Learning Station to access information\nfrom the course handbook and contact information. This use of the Learning Station\nfor contact information had become more or less routine for some students who felt\nthat it was useful to have all this information in one place, and that the system acted as\na kind of Filofax for the course.\n(ii) Informer - the use of the Learning Station in this role had decreased. Students accessed\ndeadline dates and a couple commented on the loss of the course deadline calendar during\none Learning Station update. The need for up-to-date information, and increased amounts\nof information, were still concerns; students still felt there were gaps in the material\nprovided, and sometimes found that information they would have liked was not available.\n(iii) Assessor - the students surveyed were still using Learning Station most frequently for\nundertaking self-assessment exercises. Over 90 per cent undertook the self-assessed exer-\ncises provided, although fewer used the Learning Station for help with the tutor-assessed\nwork. The electronic quizzes were still a highlight of the system for several students.\n42\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\ninn -,\nIUU\n80-\n60-\n40-\n20-\n0-L\nModi\n\u2022\nMod2 Mod3 Mod4\nModules\n1J\nMod5\n\u2022 not at all\n\u2022 1-5 times\nD 6-10 times\nH>10 times\n\u2022 no answer\nFigure \/: The number of times trie Learning Station was used by surveyed students\nModi Mod 2 Mod 3 Mod 4\nModules\nMod 5\n\u2022 0\n\u2022 1-5 hours\n\u2022 6-10 hours\nB10-20 hours\n\u2022 no answer\nFigure 2: The number of hours the Learning Station was used by surveyed students\n(iv) Tutor\/motivator - the limitations of some of the interactive demonstrations and slide\nshows were now criticized; some felt these were of limited content and often needed\nfuller explanations. However, the slide shows and graphics in the Learning Station\nwere still a positive aspect for many students.\nNegative aspects this time strongly focused on three issues. Firstly, and most significantly,\nstudents had had problems with installation of updates to the Learning Station, with\nrunning software, and with bugs in the software. This may partly be due to the limited\ninstallations options available (the Learning Station was designed to run in a specific\n43\nSarah Cornelius and Ian Heywood An interactive learning environment in Geographical Information Systems\n100\n80 \u2022\n60\n.\u00a3 1 20\n\u2022 Group A\n\u2022 Group B\nr- CM (O it\nStatement number\nKey to statements:\nThe Learning Station:\n1 helps learn about course materials\n2 helps understanding of course materials\n3 helps provide extra ideas and materials\n4 helps provide feedback on progress\n5 helps provide motivation for learning\n6 helps improve learning process\n7 is more convenient than telephoning a tutor\nFigure 3: Attitudes to the Learning Station\n8 is time-consuming and frustrating\n9 provides useful course information\n10 is a poor substitute for face-to-face communication\n11 increases my motivation to learn\n12 encourages greater autonomy and self-direction\n13 is a gimmick\n14 could become an essential part of the course\ndirectory structure on the C: drive), and as students gained in confidence with the course\nsoftware they wanted to install it on different machines, and on different drives. However,\nmany of the problems may have been due to the need to keep up with a punishing\nproduction schedule to ensure that computer-based materials were available with each\nmodule. Despite testing on several different PCs before dispatch, problems still appeared to\narise. In addition, software copying was done by an external reprographics firm, and\noccasionally problems originated at the disk-copying stage. Students also criticized the\namount of hard-disk space the system was requiring.\nA second set of issues related to the information provided. Many students felt that there\nwere still gaps in what was available, that the Learning Station was not as informative as it\ncould have been, and that access to additional resources, such as complete journal articles,\nwould have been useful. Finally, students commented again on the interface, feeling that it\nwas a little cumbersome, with odd navigation, a few typing errors and unclear exit route.\nFigure 3 illustrates changes in attitude towards the Learning Station between Groups A\nand B. Whereas Group A were highly positive towards the Learning Station, opinions seem\nto have mellowed over time, and Group B were in almost all cases less likely to agree with\nthe statements in the survey which emphasized the positive aspects of the system. For\nexample, the percentage agreeing with the statement that the Learning Station provides\nuseful course information dropped from well over 90 per cent to just over 50 per cent; and\n44\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nthose agreeing that the Learning Station helps to learn about course materials decreased\nfrom over 70 per cent to approximately 35 per cent. At the same time, the second survey\ngroup were more likely to agree that the Learning Station is a gimmick (increase from 10\nper cent to 12 per cent), that the Learning Station is a poor substitute for face-to-face\ncommunications (increase from 29 per cent to 50 per cent), and that the Learning Station is\ntime-consuming and frustrating (increase from 10 per cent to 31 per cent). These changes\nin attitude may well be linked with the technical problems outlined above, with the lack of\ninformation on all topics available, and general familiarization with the system leading to a\nrealization that it is not there to solve all student queries and problems. The need for face-\nto-face contact, or direct communication, was also flagged, revealing that the students still\nneed the motivation of tutor and colleague support. Allied to this were comments about\nthe use of email by staff, who did not always respond quickly enough.\nIssues for development\nA number of challenges face the development of the Learning Station. Some of these have\nbeen outlined in Cornelius et al (1994); others have become apparent from the results of\nthe above evaluation.\nResources appear to be the primary issue for both students using the system and staff\ninvolved in development. From the development point of view, the need for sufficient\nresources for development itself, for testing the system before dispatch, for quality control\nand rapid communication of problems to students, is clear. For the Unigis courses, the\nLearning Station was developed initially by a small team, with a full-time programmer\nbeing brought in to implement the system throughout the course. Resources had to be\nfound to fund the programmer post, and the rest of the course team had to be encouraged\nto participate in the development of the system to ensure that all modules had links to the\nLearning Station. There are other resource implications which affect these and similar\ndevelopments of digital course materials. Obtaining permission to use resources developed\nelsewhere in the Learning Station is a time-consuming process, often expensive, and often,\nwhere materials are in digital format, or published on the Internet, difficult to pursue.\nFrom the student point of view, the Learning Station is expected to be a comprehensive\nreference source. Given the difficulties of a fully stretched course team keeping to\nproduction deadlines, perhaps one way to address this requirement is for the students\nthemselves to contribute to some of the information sections of the Learning Station.\nHardware and software resources are another issue. The pace of technological develop-\nments in multimedia, the Internet and related areas is exciting and challenging. However,\nthere is a wide gap between what is technically feasible and what will work for students at\nhome. This is illustrated by the situation as regards electronic communications. Despite\nwide use in the academic community, they.are less well used in many organizations. Just\nunder one third of the 1995-1996 cohort of UK-based students were on email, although\nthe figure was higher for centres in other countries such as Austria. Most UK students are\nnew to email and the Internet, and to allow time for experience and skills in this area to\ndevelop, the electronic communication part of the Learning Station is currently an\noptional extra. However, given the pace of current development and the increasing avail-\nability of local access to Internet providers, electronic communications are considered by\n45\nSarah Cornelius and Ian Heywood An interactive learning environment in Geographical Information Systems\ncourse providers as likely to be essential in the near future. Interestingly, however, the same\nopinion is not prevalent among students. Only a small minority of students are very much\nin favour of the use of the Internet and email, and suggest, for example, that the Learning\nStation-has been eclipsed by the Internet, or that much of the contact information on the\nLearning Station could be presented on the Internet to help save hard-disk space on home\nPCs. However, there is still a proportion (16 per cent of those from Group B who have\nemail) who do not think it should be made a compulsory requirement for students to have\naccess to email.\nThe costs of some of the multimedia technologies are still prohibitive for some students on\na course of this nature. CD-ROM, for instance, would be ideal for the storage of included\narticles, and videos of case studies and discussion sessions, and is therefore a development\nwhich will be built into the Learning Station in anticipation of falling costs. Access to CD-\nROM is likely to become a requirement for students on the Austria-based courses since\nthere are examples of externally produced data sets, conference proceedings, and software\ndemonstrations already available on CD-ROM which are ideal resources for the diploma.\nIt seems likely that developments in PC technology and operating systems and rapidly\nfalling costs will help to promote home computing in a more general manner, thus placing\nthe resources required within easy reach of all Unigis students in the near future.\nThere is also the more fundamental question of whether the quality of the learning process\nwill actually be improved by the availability of a computer-managed learning tool such as\nthe Learning Station. Will it improve or impede learning? Some findings, for example\nMason (1994) and Goodyear (1994), suggest that learning and motivation will be\nsignificantly improved for distance learning students through interaction with course\nmaterials, and particularly through increased communication with staff and other\nstudents. From the evaluation of student attitudes, it is clear that different students have\ndifferent experiences with the Learning Station. However, encouragingly, after almost half\nof the course, there is still a high proportion who feel that the Learning Station helps to\nimprove the learning process (61 per cent) and is an essential part of the course (69 per\ncent). Lower percentages agree that the Learning Station helps their understanding of\ncourse materials (46 per cent) or helps to provide motivation for learning (38 per cent). The\nchallenge for the Learning Station development appears to be to produce a system which\nwill continue to 'delight the student' throughout his or her studies, while preventing\nfrustrating technical hitches and providing full and appropriate information to meet\nstudent requirements.\nConclusion\nThe Learning Station develops earlier ideas for computer-based tools for GIS education,\nand the methods being adopted are applicable to a wide range of GIS educational\nsituations, including undergraduate resource-based learning, and professional updating.\nFor Unigis distance-learning students there is a clear need for trie computer to act as\nadvisor, informer, assessor and tutor, since these students are outside the traditional\nclassroom environment. The existence of current computer-based materials in a variety of\nformats which can be adapted arid developed to meet these needs within a multimedia\nframework supports the development of the Learning Station. The Learning Station\napproach proposed offers the opportunity to co-ordinate the wide variety of computer-\n46\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nbased tools, including electronic communications, animation, existing CAL packages, and\nGIS and other software, which are already being used in the course. Learning-management\ntools like this, which offer more flexible and effective GIS education, will help to meet the\nchallenges of life-long education in a complex and fast moving discipline such as GIS if\nresources are available to developers, tutors and students, and if innovative materials can\nbe continually developed and updated to meet student needs.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Josef Strobl, James Oliver, Steve\nTomlinson and Hong-Mei Wu with the development of the Learning Station.
