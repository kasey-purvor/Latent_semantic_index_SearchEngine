The dual of a k\/n(F ) is k\/n(G)(i.e. k-out-of-n : G), which consists of n\ncomponents but it works if and only if at least k components work. Obviously, a k\/n(F )\nsystem is equivalent to a (n \u2212 k + 1)\/n(G) system. A 1\/n(F ) (or n\/n(F )) system is a\nn-component series (or parallel) system. If k components are consecutive in a k\/n(F\nor G) system, the system becomes a C(k, n : F or G) (i.e. consecutive-k-out-of-n:\nF or G) system. Therefore, a k\/n(F or G) system can be seen as an extension of\nvarious reliability systems, and it plays an important role in the reliability theory and\nreal applications. This important feature attracts considerable research. For example,\nBarlow and Proschan [1], Linton and Saw [2], Phillips [3], Gupta and Sharma [4], Kenyon\nand Newell [5], Nakagawa [6], McGrady [7] and Moustafa [8], etc. They studied such\na system with different approaches: they commonly assume that either the system is\nnot repairable or the repair-equipment does not fail. However, in practice, a piece of\nrepair-equipment may experience failures.\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the reliability of a k\/n(F ) repairable system\nwith repairable repair-equipment. We assume that a failed component in the system can\nbe repaired as good as new, whereas the survival times of the repair-equipment after re-\npair form a geometric process. The geometric process has been applied to optimize main-\ntenance policies in various repairable systems, including simple systems, two-component\nsystems and multi-component systems since it was first introduced by Lam [9, 10]. For\nmore references, the reader is referred to Lam [11], Zhang [12, 13, 14, 15], Lam et al [16],\nZhang et al [17, 18, 19], Lam and Zhang [20, 21, 22], Wu and Clements-Croome [23,24],\nWang and Zhang [25, 26], Zhang and Wang [27, 28, 29], and Lam et al [30].\nUsing the queueing theory, the vector Markov process and the geometric process, we\nnot only derive reliability indices of such a k\/n(F ) repairable system, but also optimize\nreplacement policyN . The replacement policy aims to search an optimum failure number\nN\u2217 such that the expected cost rate of the repair-equipment is minimized. Finally, a\nnumerical example for policy N is given to illustrate some theoretical results.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the definition of the geomet-\nric process and assumptions for the reliability analysis in the paper. Section 3 conducts\nsystem analysis using the vector Markov process. Section 4 discusses properties and\nreliability indices of the k\/n(F ) system. Section 5 derives replacement policy N\u2217 and\nprovides a numerical example. Section 6 concludes this paper.\n2\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n2 Definitions and assumptions\nDefinition 1 Given two random variables \u03be and \u03b7, \u03be is said to be stochastically\nlarger than \u03b7 or \u03b7 is stochastically smaller than \u03be, if\nP (\u03be > \u03b1) \u2265 P (\u03b7 > \u03b1), for all real \u03b1,\ndenoted by \u03be \u2265st \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2264st \u03be (see e.g., Ross[31]). Furthermore, we say that a stochastic\nprocess {Xn, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7} is stochastically decreasing if Xn \u2265st Xn+1 and stochastically\nincreasing if Xn \u2264st Xn+1 for all n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7.\nDefinition 2 A stochastic process {\u03ben, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7} is a geometric process, if there\nexists a real a > 0 such that {an\u22121\u03ben, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7} forms a renewal process. The real a\nis called the ratio of the geometric process (see e.g., Lam [10], Zhang [12] for more details).\nObviously, from Definition 2, we have:\n(i) If a > 1, then {\u03ben, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7} is stochastically decreasing, i.e.\n\u03ben \u2265st \u03ben+1, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(ii) If 0 < a < 1, then {\u03ben, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7} is stochastically increasing, i.e.\n\u03ben \u2264st \u03ben+1, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n(iii) If a = 1, then the geometric process becomes a renewal process.\n(iv) If E\u03be1 = 1\u03bb , then E\u03ben =\n1\nan\u22121\u03bb .\nSuppose the following assumptions hold.\nAssumption 1 A system consists of n identical components and repairable repair-\nequipment. The system fails if and only if at least k components have failed. The n\ncomponents are repairable, and the order of repair for failed components is with a \u201dfirst\nin first out\u201d rule.\nAssumption 2 At the beginning, a new k\/n(F ) system, repairable repair-equipment\nand one repairman are installed. A failed component is repaired by the repair-equipment\nand the repair-equipment is repaired by the repairman. Repair for a failed component is\nperfect whereas repair for the repair-equipment is imperfect.

The repair-equipment will be re-started immediately after com-\npletion of its repair, and the repair on the failed component will be continued. During\nthe repair for the repair-equipment, the system is shut down and the un-failed compo-\nnents in the system do not fail any more. The repair-equipment does not fail when it\nis idle. As soon as at least k components are ready for work, the system will be re-started.\nAssumption 4 Assume that the successive working times \u03ben, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 and the\nconsecutive repair times \u03b7n, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 of all n components are respectively i.i.d. random\nvariables, and their survival distributions are\nF (t) = P (\u03ben \u2264 t) = 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bbt\nG(t) = P (\u03b7n \u2264 t) = 1\u2212 e\u2212\u00b5t\nwhere t \u2265 0, \u03bb > 0, \u00b5 > 0, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 respectively. Assume that \u00b5 > \u03bb.\nAssumption 5 The time interval between the completions of the (n\u22121)th and nth\nrepairs of the repair-equipment is called the nth cycle of the repair-equipment. Let Xn\nand Yn be respectively the working and the repair times of the repair-equipment in the\nnth cycle, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . Then {Xn, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7} and {Yn, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7} form respectively\na decreasing geometric process with ratio a \u2265 1 and a increasing geometric process with\nratio 0 < b \u2264 1, and survival distributions of Xn and Yn are\nHn(t) = P (Xn \u2264 t) = 1\u2212 e\u2212an\u22121\u03b1t\nKn(t) = P (Yn \u2264 t) = 1\u2212 e\u2212bn\u22121\u03b2t\nwhere t \u2265 0, \u03b1 > 0, \u03b2 > 0, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 respectively.\nAssumption 6 \u03ben, \u03b7n, Xn, Yn, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 are all independent random variable\nsequences.\n4\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nRemarks\n(1) The assumption \u00b5 > \u03bb makes the k\/n(F ) repairable system closer to real situa-\ntions.\n(2) If we regard the three items, the repair-equipment, a failed component and a repair\nas a service station, a customer and a service respectively, then the three forms a queue-\ning system. Under the above assumptions, the k\/n(F ) repairable system is equivalent to\na repairable M\/M\/1 queueing system with finite customer-source. Hence, the system in\nthis paper can be regarded as a repairable M\/M(M\/M)\/1\/k\/n queueing system, where\nsymbol (M\/M) means that both the working and repair times of the service station (i.e.\nthe repair-equipment) are exponential. The difference between our queueing system and\nthe classical M\/M\/1\/k\/n queueing system is that the service station in our queueing\nsystem is subject to failure. In this paper, we shall study a k\/n(F ) repairable system\nwith repairable repair-equipment and regard them as a M\/M(M\/M)\/1\/k\/n queueing\nsystem with repairable service station.\n(3) Assumption 3 is reasonable. For example, consider a local area computer network\nprint system with a repairable printer, and there are several workstations connecting to\nprinter. Now, we regard the printer and a print job as a service station and a customer in\nthe print system respectively. Printing jobs submitted from a workstation have to queue\nup as customers in the print system. If the printer fails to work, it will be repaired, and\nthe jobs have to wait for printing. The printer will be restarted immediately after com-\npletion of its repair, and the queueing printing jobs can be conducted. The reader is also\nreferred to Lam et al [30] for more detailed discussion. From an application perspective,\ntherefore, the research of this paper is helpful for some maintenance engineers.\n5\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n3 System analysis\nNow, let N(t) be the system state at time t.

To\ndetermine the mean of busy period for the repair-equipment, we study a stochastic\nprocess {N\u02dc(t), t \u2265 0}. The only difference between the processes {N(t), t \u2265 0} and\n{N\u02dc(t), t \u2265 0} is that the state 0 is an absorbing state in {N\u02dc(t), t \u2265 0}.\nLet B\u02dc be the length of a busy period, then the distribution function is given by\nB\u02dc(t) = P{B\u02dc \u2264 t} = P{N\u02dc(t) = 0}\nFurthermore, we can obtain the following theorem about the distribution of busy period.\nTheorem 5\nB\u02dc(t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nl=1\nB(t)[1\u2212Hl(t)] +\n\u221e\u2211\nl=1\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u222b t\n0\nB(t\u2212 u)[H(n)l (t\u2212 u)\u2212H(n+1)l (t\u2212 u)]dK(n)l (u)\nwhere B(t) is the distribution of a busy period in the classical M\/M\/1 queueing system.\nProof First of all, we introduce a supplementary variable S\u02dc(t) which is the same\nas the S(t) in the process {N(t), t \u2265 0}, such that S\u02dc(t) = lw, if the (l \u2212 1)th repair has\n16\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nbeen completed.

The repair-equipment will be replaced by a new and identical\none whenever the failure number of the repair-equipment reaches N . Our objective is\nto search an optimal replacement policy N\u2217 such that the expected cost rate of the\nrepair-equipment is minimized. To do this, we add the following assumptions.\nAssumption 7 A replacement policy N based on the number of failures of the\nrepair-equipment is used. The repair-equipment will be replaced sometime by a new and\nidentical one, and the replacement time is negligible.\nAssumption 8 The repair cost rate of the repair-equipment is cr, the working\nreward rate of the repair-equipment is cw, and the fixed replacement cost of the repair-\nequipment is C.\nLet \u03c41 be the first replacement time of the repair-equipment after installation, and\n\u03c4n(n \u2265 2) be the time between the (n \u2212 1)th and the nth replacements of the repair-\nequipment under policy N. Clearly, {\u03c41, \u03c42, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7} forms a renewal process, and the time\nbetween two consecutive replacements is called a renewal cycle.\nLet C(N) be the expected cost rate of the repair-equipment under policy N . Thus,\naccording to the model assumptions and the renewal reward theorem (see, for example\n20\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nRoss [31]), we have\nC(N) =\nthe expected cost incurred in a renewal cycle\nthe expected length of a renewal cycle\n=\nE(cr\nN\u22121\u2211\nj=1\nYj + C \u2212 cw\nN\u2211\nj=1\nXj)\nE(\nN\u22121\u2211\nj=1\nYj +\nN\u2211\nj=1\nXj)\n=\ncr\nN\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n1\nbj\u22121\u03b2 + C \u2212 cw\nN\u2211\nj=1\n1\naj\u22121\u03b1\nN\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n1\nbj\u22121\u03b2 +\nN\u2211\nj=1\n1\naj\u22121\u03b1\n(24)\nObviously, we can determine an optimal replacement policy N\u2217 by analytical or\nnumerical methods such that C(N) is minimized.\n5.2 Optimal replacement policy N \u2217\nIn order to determine the optimal replacement policy N\u2217 for minimizing C(N) ex-\nplicitly, we rewrite the equation (24) as\nC(N) = A(N)\u2212 cw,\nwhere\nA(N) =\n(cr + cw)\nN\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n1\nbj\u22121\u03b2 + C\nN\u2211\nj=1\n1\naj\u22121\u03b1 +\nN\u22121\u2211\nj=1\n1\nbj\u22121\u03b2\n.\nThus, to minimize C(N) is equivalent to minimize A(N).

We assume that the working time distributions and the\nrepair time distributions of all components, and the repair-equipment in the system are\nexponential, repair on a failed component is perfect, and repair on the repair-equipment\nis imperfect, i.e. the survival times of the repair-equipment after repair form a geometric\nprocess. We then derive properties and reliability indices for such a system, as well as\nreplacement policy for the repair-equipment, using theories from the geometric process,\nthe vector Markov process and the queueing theory. The results in this paper are inter-\nesting from a theoretical perspective and useful from a practical application perspective.\nThe following findings are also achieved.\n(1) According to the assumptions in Section 2, we have indicated that the k\/n(F ) re-\npairable system with repairable repair-equipment is equivalent to aM\/M(M\/M)\/1\/k\/n\nqueueing system with repairable service station. By using the queueing theory, we de-\nrived properties and reliability indices of the k\/n(F ) repairable system on the basis of\nthe concept of busy period for classical M\/M\/1 queueing system. It is a generalization\nof the existing work. For example, if we let a = b = 1, the M\/M(M\/M)\/1\/k\/n queue-\ning system with repairable service station in which repair is imperfect will reduce to a\nM\/M(M\/M)\/1\/k\/n queueing system with repairable service station in which repair is\nperfect. Therefore, the method introduced in this paper is new for analyzing the relia-\nbility of the k\/n(F ) repairable system with repairable repair-equipment.\n(2) Although the geometric process has been wildly applied to the maintenance op-\ntimization for the simple repairable system and the multi-component series, parallel and\ncold standby repairable systems, this is the first work to apply the geometric process to\na k\/n(F ) system with repairable repair-equipment.\n(3) Let N(t) be the state of the k\/n(F ) system with repairable repair-equipment at\ntime t. It is clear from model assumptions that {N(t), t \u2265 0} is not a Markov pro-\ncess. However, it can be extended to be a vector Markov process (i.e. a two-dimensional\nMarkov process) by introducing a supplementary variable. To obtain properties and\nreliability indices of the system, we need to determine the state probabilities of the\nsystem at time t. Accordingly, we can derive the system of differential equations about\npmlw(t), (m = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k\u22121; l = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7) and pmlf (t), (m = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k\u22121, k; l = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7).\nFinally, the Laplace transform results of reliability indices of the system are obtained.\nIn general, conducting an inverse Laplace transformation to obtain transient results of\nreliability indices is not easy, and results from Laplace transformation of reliability in-\n25\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \ndices of the system are hard to obtain for practical application. Thus, for practical use, a\nnumerical method based on the Runge-Kutta method is often adopted (see, e.g., Zhang\nand Wang [29]).\n(4) In this paper, we consider a replacement policy N based on the number of failures\nof the repairable repair-equipment. An optimal replacement policy N\u2217 for minimizing\nC(N) is determined. The uniqueness of the optimal replacement policy N\u2217 is proved.\nAnd a given numerical example can also illustrate the theoretical result. Theorem 8\ncan be used in practice, as based on this theorem one can stop searching the optimum\nwhenever B(N) crosses over 1.\n(5) Our future work will be to conduct research for the situation where all components\nin the system are not \u201das good as new\u201d or there are r(r > 1) repairable repair-equipment.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors are grateful to the editor and referees for their valuable comments and\nsuggestions which have considerably improved the presentation of the paper.\nReferences\n[1] Barlow, R.E. and Proschan, F., (1965) Mathematical Theory of Reliability.
