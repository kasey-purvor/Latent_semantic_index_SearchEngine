C. parvum is the species that dominates infection in hu-\nmans. In immunocompetent individuals, it causes a self-limit-\ning (10\u201325 d) disease with symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, and\nlow-grade fever with occasional vomiting, whereas, in immu-\nnocompromised individuals, it can lead to chronic disease [2].\nFrom human-feeding studies, the infective dose of C. parvum\nhas been found to be extremely low [3\u20135], with ID50 values\nranging from \u223c2000 to as few as 12 oocysts [6].\nReceived 24 September 2002; accepted 21 March 2003; electronically published 8 August\n2003.\nReprints or correspondence: Dr. Norval J.

Crypto-\nsporidiosis in humans is also associated with foreign travel,\nfood, and direct contact with infected humans, farm animals,\nand wild animals [1, 7, 9]. It comprises 2 main genotypes [10]:\ngenotype 1 (human type), which occurs virtually exclusively in\ninfected humans, and genotype 2 (animal type), which occurs\nin farm animals as well as in humans.\nIn Scotland, rates of cryptosporidiosis infection in farm an-\nimals peak during the spring, a peak that is coincident with\nlambing and calving time [7]. Similarly, rates of infection in\nhumans peak during the spring, a peak principally comprising\ninfections due to the animal genotype, with a smaller peak in\nlate summer\/early autumn comprising infections due to either\ngenotype. In the United Kingdom, the outbreak of foot and\nmouth disease (FMD) during 2001 began in early February,\nand Scotland was not declared to be free of the disease until\n11 September 2001. It has been reported that, in northern\nEngland, there was a significant reduction in cases of human\ncryptosporidiosis infection during the outbreak of FMD [11,\n12]. In Scotland, the FMD epidemic was contained within the\nsouth, in the regions of Dumfries and Galloway and the Bor-\nders, where \u223c31% of the 2.9 million sheep and \u223c17% of the\n0.6 million cattle were slaughtered\u2014whereas, in the FMD-free\narea of Scotland, !0.02% of the 6.2 million sheep and !0.5%\nof the 1.4 million cattle were slaughtered [13].\nRestrictions on both the transport of animals and access to\nthe countryside for humans were imposed on 23 February 2001\nand were in place throughout Scotland from spring to summer\/\nautumn. In Scotland during 2001, rates of cryptosporidiosis\ninfection in humans fell by 34%, compared with those during\nthe previous year [14]. Here we discuss both the temporal\nreduction in rates of cryptosporidiosis infection in humans in\nthe FMD-infected area of Scotland and how this reduction\ncompares with that in the remainder of Scotland.\nMethods. Data on weekly rates of cryptosporidiosis infec-\ntion in humans, for each of the regions in Scotland, during\n1994\u20132002, were obtained from the Scottish Centre for Infec-\ntion and Environmental Health [14]. Data on monthly rates\nof infection in cattle and sheep, during 1994\u20132002, were ob-\ntained from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Addlestone,\n784 \u2022 JID 2003:188 (1 September) \u2022 BRIEF REPORT\nFigure 1. Reports of cryptosporidiosis in humans (A) and cattle (C) in FMD-infected areas of Scotland and in humans (B) and cattle (D) in FMD-\nfree areas of Scotland.\nUnited Kingdom. Data sets on infection both in humans and\nin animals were collated into Microsoft Excel and were then\nmerged into a data set for the FMD-infected area (southern\nScotland, comprising Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders)\nand into a data set for the FMD-free area (the remainder of\nScotland). The data for the FMD-free area during 1998 were\nomitted from analysis because of a large outbreak of crypto-\nsporidiosis in the Greater Glasgow area.\nThe t test was used to independently determine whether,\nduring the outbreak of FMD, there was a significant reduc-\ntion in the rate of cryptosporidiosis infection in humans in\nthe FMD-infected and FMD-free areas of Scotland: t pn\u00011\n, where y is the number of cases during the\u2014 \u0001(y\u0001 x)\/s 1 + (1\/n)\noutbreak (which, in 2001, occurred during weeks 13\u201338), s is\nthe SD, is the average of the preceding 7 years, and n is the\u2014x\nnumber of years. To determine whether there was a reduction\nduring the remaining weeks of 2001, data for that period were\nalso compared with the data for the preceding 7 years. To\ndetermine whether any reductions that were found persisted,\nthe data on infection during 2002 were also analyzed by the t\ntest. The t test was used to compare the data on annual cryp-\ntosporidial infection in cattle, during both 2001 and 2002, with\nthe data on cryptosporidial infection in cattle during 1994\u20132000\n(data for the FMD-infected area and those for the FMD-free\narea of Scotland were independently compared).\nResults. During 2001, rates of cryptosporidiosis infection\nin humans fell both in the FMD-infected and the FMD-free areas\nof Scotland, by 60% and 19%, respectively (figures 1A and 1B).\nDuring the actual outbreak (weeks 13\u201338 of 2001), there was a\nsignificant reduction in cases of human cryptosporidiosis infec-\ntion in the FMD-infected area ( ; ); althought p\u00012.98 Pp .0126\nthere also was a reduction in the FMD-free area, it was not\nsignificant ( ; ). During weeks 1\u201312 andt p\u00011.86 Pp .0615\n39\u201352, although there was a reduction in cases of human cryp-\ntosporidial infection in both the FMD-infected and FMD-free\nareas, it was not significant (FMD infected, ;t p\u00011.44 Pp6\n; and FMD free, ; ).

It has been hypothesized that the effects of\nthe FMD epidemic caused the reduction in cases of crypto-\nsporidiosis infection in humans throughout Scotland and par-\nticularly in the FMD-infected area. Evidence supporting this\nclaim includes the following: restrictions on movement of farm\nanimals (reducing mixing and hence reducing rates of infection\nin animals); fewer young farm animals during the spring, which\nrelease the highest loads of the organism into the environment\n(as a result of the slaughter of both pregnant adults and young\nfarm animals); reduction in cases of cryptosporidial infections\nin farm animals in the FMD-infected area of Scotland and fewer\nmembers of the public visiting the countryside, because of re-\nstrictions meant to control FMD, a decrease resulting in a re-\nduction in exposure to Cryptosporidium oocysts via direct con-\ntact with farm animals and their feces. In addition, it is not\nsurprising that rates of human cryptosporidial infection were\nreduced significantly by the outbreak of FMD in the FMD-\ninfected area, because this part of Scotland is predominantly\nrural and contains no cities, and because, on average, 46% of\ninfections coincide with the peak in lambing and calving, during\nthe second quarter of the year\u2014whereas, for the remainder of\nScotland, which contains all of the large population centers,\nonly 35% of infections occur during the second quarter of the\nyear. Particularly during the latter half of the year, this FMD-\nfree area of Scotland also has higher background levels of cryp-\ntosporidiosis infection in humans, which could largely comprise\nthe human genotype. There are, for Scotland, no genotype data\navailable to support this statement, but it does agree with the\navailable genotype data for England and Wales [7].\nOther possible explanations for the reduction in cases of\ncryptosporidiosis infection in humans during 2001 include the\nfollowing: lack of rain, hence a reduction in runoff of pathogens\nto watercourses (precipitation in the United Kingdom during\n2001 was lower than the average during 1994\u20132000, but this\nwas not significant [ ; ] [15]); chance (butt p 1.93 Pp .1016\nrates of cryptosporidiosis infection in humans were lower in\nboth the FMD-infected and FMD-free areas of Scotland than\nat any time during the previous 7 years); improvements in water\ntreatment (but this would not have stopped infection by direct\ncontact with farm animals or their feces and should have shown\na trend throughout the year if human sewage was the source);\nand increased immunoprotection of the population (but there\nis no obvious reason why this would have occurred). Hence,\nreiterating the fact that the peak in rates of cryptosporidiosis\ninfection in humans in Scotland is coincident with the peak in\nrates of infection in farm animals, the genotype data available\nfor England and Wales demonstrate that spring and summer\ninfections are dominated by the animal genotype [7] and that\nthe percentage reduction in cases of cryptosporidiosis infection\nin humans in Scotland was much higher for the FMD-infected\narea than for the FMD-free area; therefore, the only plausible\nexplanation for the reduction in cases of cryptosporidiosis in-\nfection in humans in Scotland during 2001 is the effects of the\nFMD epidemic.\nBecause of the relaxation of restrictions on movement of\npeople and animals throughout Scotland, the recovery of the\nrate of cryptosporidiosis infection in humans, during 2002 in\nScotland is not surprising. However, the numbers of infections\nin humans are still lower than average, although not signifi-\ncantly. What is surprising is that, in the FMD-infected area,\nthe numbers of cryptosporidiosis infections in cattle are still\nsignificantly below pre-2000 numbers. This could be due to\neither underreporting, since cryptosporidiosis is a nonnotifiable\ndisease, or a reluctance by farmers to encourage visits to their\nfarms unless such visits are deemed essential, because of the\nperceived potential risk of another outbreak of FMD. This study\nhas demonstrated that the perturbation of an epidemic of an\ninfectious disease in one species can have important effects on\nthe rate and pattern of infection of another infectious disease\nin another species.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the Veterinary Laboratories Agency,\nAddlestone, Surrey, United Kingdom, for providing the data\non cryptosporidial infection in cattle.\nReferences\n1.
