In this study we examined the functional significance of such polyparasite infections in anemia and undernutrition in Rwandan individuals.\\ud\n\\ud\nMethods\\ud\n\\ud\nThree polyparasite infection profiles were defined, in addition to a reference profile that consisted of either no infections or low-intensity infection with only one of the focal parasite species. Logistic regression models were applied to data of 1,605 individuals from 6 schools in 2 districts of the Northern Province before chemotherapeutic treatment in order to correctly identify individuals who were at higher odds of being anaemic and\/or undernourished.\\ud\n\\ud\nFindings\\ud\n\\ud\nStunted relative to nonstunted, and males compared to females, were found to be at higher odds of being anaemic independently of polyparasite infection profile. The odds of being wasted were 2-fold greater for children with concurrent infection of at least 2 parasites at M+ intensity compared to those children with the reference profile. Males compared to females and anaemic compared to nonanaemic children were significantly more likely to be stunted. None of the three polyparasite infection profiles were found to have significant effects on stunting.\\ud\n\\ud\nConclusion\\ud\n\\ud\nThe present data suggest that the levels of polyparasitism, and infection intensities in the Rwandan individuals examined here may be lower as compared to other recent similar epidemiological studies in different regions across sub-Saharan Africa.

In\nparticular, intestinal schistosomiasis and polyparasitic soil-trans-\nmitted helminths (STHs) infections constitute major public health\nproblems in sub-Saharan Africa [5,7,8]. Despite the considerable\nattention in epidemiological literature to the profile of the\naforementioned infections, there are very few human studies that\nhave examined the morbidity implications of polyparasitism\n[9,10,11]. Investigating the implications of polyparasitism mor-\nbidity is particularly relevant for healthcare providers in many\ndeveloping countries where they must decide screening and\ntreatment strategies in resource-limited settings [10].\nThe United Nations\u2019 fifth report on world nutrition emphasized\nthat malnutrition is the largest contributor to ill-health in the world\nand that diet-related risk factors for chronic disease are responsible for\na large share of the burden of disease in low mortality developing\ncountries [12]. Furthermore, this same report underscored that the\neffect of such malnutrition is exacerbated by the 4 to 5 billion\nindividuals in the developing world who simultaneously suffer from\niron deficiency and its related form of anemia, whilst it also highlighted\nthe high prevalence of anemia throughout the developing world.\nThe link between hookworm infection and anaemia is well\nknown, and the mechanism of effect through intestinal blood loss\nwww.plosntds.org 1 September 2009 | Volume 3 | Issue 9 | e517\nhas been described [13,14,15,16,17,18]. Recent large scale studies\nhave suggested links between heavy intensities of Schistosoma\nmansoni infections (the intestinal type of schistosomiasis mainly\nfound in sub-Saharan Africa) with anaemia and lowered\nhaemoglobin counts [19,20,21]. The mechanisms underlying S.\nmansoni associated anaemia are likely multifactorial (e.g., iron\ndeficiency due to extra-corporeal loss, splenic sequestration,\nautoimmune haemolysis and anaemia of inflammation) and have\nalso been documented [22,23]. Moderate or high intensities of\nTrichuris trichiura are also associated with higher risks of anaemia in\nthe presence of other STHs [24], while the impact of Ascaris\nlumbricoides on anaemia is less clear [10].\nDifferent types of helminth infection may affect nutritional\nstatus in different ways (e.g., nutrient absorption, and degree of\nmucosal damage) [25]. Previous studies indicated various\nmechanisms through which hookworm, S. mansoni, T. trichiura\nand A. lumbricoides infections might alter nutritional status\n[11,22,26,27]. Several studies have found positive associations\nbetween malnutrition and the aforementioned intestinal parasites,\nbut they have always limited their focus to single helminth species\nrather than looking at combinations of helminth species present\n[28,29,30,31]. In addition, Ezeamama and colleagues [9] have\nemphasized the lack, and at the same time the need for,\nepidemiological studies that examine the effect of polyparasite\ninfections at various intensities in a range of morbidities.\nIn the present study, we have used uniquely detailed data from\nthe Rwandan national Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) control\nprogramme in order to refine and understand the functional\nsignificance of polyparasite infections in anaemia and undernutri-\ntion in mainly school aged children from two districts in Northern\nRwanda. The objectives of this study were to examine the\ndistribution and the intensities of such polyparasite infections as\nwell as to elucidate whether if individuals concurrently infected\nwith multiple helminth species have measurably increased odds of\nbeing anaemic and\/or undernourished.\nMethods\nEthics statement\nEthical approval for Monitoring & Evaluation (M & E) surveys\nwas obtained from the Rwandan National Ethical Committee and\nColumbia University\u2019s International Review Board. The aim of\nthe survey was explained to the participants, their parents,\nguardians and teachers before data collection. Moreover, only\nchildren who had completed their assent form and presented a\nconsent form signed by their parents were entered in these surveys.\nControl programme, study sites, population, sampling,\nand design\nRwanda is a landlocked country in the Great Lakes region of\neast-central Africa, bordered by Uganda, Burundi, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and Tanzania. It is one of the smallest\ncountries of Africa (26, 338 km2), but is home to approximately\n10.1 million people thus supporting the densest population in\ncontinental Africa, with most of the population engaged in\nsubsistence agriculture. A verdant country of fertile and hilly\nterrain with altitudes varying from 950 m to 4519 m, the small\nrepublic bears the title \u2018\u2018Land of a Thousand Hills\u2019\u2019.\nThe Rwanda MoH through the Centre for Treatment and\nResearch on AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis and Other Epidemics\n(TRAC Plus) - a centre for infectious disease control - was charged\nwith planning and implementing data collection with the\nassistance from the National Reference Laboratory and the Access\nproject.\nFor the M & E survey, schools in both districts were randomly\nselected from three sample frames to allow the programme to be\nevaluated in 2 low-, 2 medium- and 2 high-schistosomiasis\nprevalence schools. More precisely these sample frames were\ndefined as follows:\nN one school located less than 1 km away from each of the Lakes\nRuhondo and Burera- this was aimed to represent a high\nschistosomiasis prevalence school in each of the 2 districts\nN one school located between 2 km and 3 km away from each of\nthe Lakes Ruhondo and Burera- this was aimed to represent a\nmedium schistosomiasis prevalence school in each of the 2\ndistricts\nN one school located between 4 km and 5 km away from each of\nthe Lakes Ruhondo and Burera- this was aimed to represent a\nlow schistosomiasis prevalence school in each of the 2 districts\nIt should be noted that the aforementioned lakes are located in\ndifferent districts and they were selected on the basis that distance\nto the lakeshore has been proven useful to screen schools in the\ngreater region [32]. The required sample sizes for children were\ncalculated based on schistosomiasis prevalence\/intensity data from\nschools in various African countries with similar age ranges\nassuming expected reductions in S. mansoni intensities over two\nannual treatments through EpiSchisto software (http:\/\/www.\nschoolsandhealth.org\/epidynamics.htm); more technical details\nhave been described elsewhere [33] and hence they are not\nrepeated here. In addition, 120 adults were randomly selected in\ntwo villages from the two aforementioned districts, which were\nlocated less than 1 km away from each of the lakes. This adult sub-\ngroup was included with the aim of monitoring the future impact\nof Mass Drug Administration (MDA) on S. mansoni-related hepatic\nfibrosis, where highest morbidity\/symptomology tends to be\ndisplayed in this older age group. However, for the purposes of\nthe current analyses, we decided to include data from individuals\nof up to 20 years old, thereby inclusive of the end of the growing\nperiod for late maturers.\nThese data were collected during February to April in 2008,\nbased on results of mapping surveys in 2007 (data not presented\nhere) with the aim to determine pre-treatment levels of the\ninfection status and some clinical indicators.\nAuthor Summary\nThe helminth infections\u2014schistosomiasis, hookworm, as-\ncariasis and trichuriasis\u2014are the main neglected tropical\ndiseases (NTDs) to thrive in sub-Saharan Africa. Here we\nassess the distribution and the intensities of such\npolyparasite infections in two districts of the Northern\nProvince in Rwanda and determine whether these are\nassociated with anaemia, lowered haemoglobin levels and\nrecent and\/or chronic undernutrition. Rwanda is a small\nlandlocked country in Central Africa where no research or\ncontrol efforts on NTDs has been conducted since before\nthe genocide in 1994. The current study aimed to\nelucidate, for the first time post-genocide, the burden of\nNTDs on the health of the Rwandan people and potential\nassociated morbidity. Despite the fact that we observed\nlow morbidity levels and intensities of polyparasite\nhelminth infections, we recommend sustainable efforts\nfor the deworming of the Rwandan people to be\ncontinued in order to offer a worm-free physical and\ncognitive development to the children of Rwanda and\nhence support the economic development of the country.\nNTDs in Northern Rwanda\nwww.plosntds.org 2 September 2009 | Volume 3 | Issue 9 | e517\nInfection intensity\nThe parasite burden was determined by duplicate examination\nfrom different microscopists of one stool specimen, at the same\ntime, from each study participant for the presence of S. mansoni, T.\ntrichiura, A. lumbricoides and hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale) by the\nKato-Katz method. This was due to logistical and financial\nreasons and can be justified within the scale of a large-scale control\nprogramme, although we are fully aware that replicate stool\nsamples over several days are ideally required to accurately\nestimate intensity of schistosomiasis and STH. The mean number\nof eggs per gram (EPG) of stool for each parasite was used to\ndefine infections of low and moderate\/high (M+) intensity in\naccordance with WHO-established intensity cutoff values for S.\nmansoni, T. trichiura, hookworm and A. lumbricoides infections.\nPrimary determinant: parasite infection profiles\nParasite infection profiles were based on infection status of the\nstudy participants; these parasite infection profiles were created\nusing a similar technique developed in a study conducted in rice-\nfarming villages in Leyte, The Philippines [9].\nGiven possible concurrent infection by up to four parasites at\none of three potential intensity levels (none, low, or M+) for each\nspecies, there were 34= 81 possible unique categories of\npolyparasite infections. A total of 47 of the 81 categories were\nfound in the current Rwandese study population. The sub profiles\nwere finally condensed into the following 4 infection profiles\ncorresponding to putatively different risk levels for anaemia and\nundernutrition:\n1. Reference profile (n = 189): no infection or infection with 1\nparasite species at low intensity;\n2. Polyparasite infection profile I (n = 582): concurrent infection\nwith 2, 3, or 4 parasite species at low intensity;\n3. Polyparasite infection profile II (n = 543): infection with 1\nparasite species at M+ intensity and all other parasite species\npresent at low intensity or absent;\n4. Polyparasite infection profile III (n = 291): concurrent infection\nwith at least 2 parasite species at M+ intensity and all other\nparasite species present at low intensity or absent. More\nprecisely, in this polyparasite infection profile 6 children had\nconcurrent infection with 3 or 4 parasites at M+ intensity.\nMorbidity indicators\nHeights were measured with height poles which had a fixed\nhead board and can thus be considered comparable to that of the\nNHANES stadiometer (http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/products\/\nelec_prods\/subject\/video.htm). More precisely, the stature meter\nwas placed to the floor and for each individual the tape was pulled\nup until zero reached the red line. The upper part of the pole was\nthen firmly and accurately attached to the wall and fixed with\nscrews. Finally the meter was pulled down onto the head of\nindividual to get the measurement. Weights were measured with\nelectronic balances. Children were asked to remove their shoes\nand all heavy clothes if they wore any and this was done in the\nmorning by the survey team. All persons performing these\nmeasurements were fully trained and experienced in the use of\nthese protocols, and the same staffs were used throughout to\nensure standardization.\nFinger prick blood samples were also obtained from each\nindividual, sufficient for accurate Hb measurement using a\nHemocue photometer [34]. Indices of the anthropometric status\nof the studied children were based on the 2000 growth reference\ncurves designed by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) as this\npopulation more closely resembles those in countries like Rwanda\nsince it includes both human milk and formula-fed infants; these\nwere computed using the Nutstat program within Epi Info V 3.4.\nThe fact that the 2000 CDC growth charts consist of sex specific\ncharts for infants, birth to age 36 months (length-for-age, weight-\nfor-length, weight-for-age, and head circumference-for-age) and\nolder children, 2 to 20 years (stature-for-age, weight-for-age and\nBody Mass Index (BMI)-for-age) led us also to the decision of\nexcluding data of individuals more than 20 years old. Low Body\nMass Index is considered an indicator of acute under-nutrition\n(thinness or wasting) and is generally associated with failure to gain\nweight or a loss of weight [35]. The Z-score cut-off point\nrecommended by WHO, CDC, and others to classify low\nanthropometric levels is 2 Standard Deviation (SD) units below\nthe reference median for this specific index. A cut-off of -2 BMI\nZ-scores was calculated to classify underweight individuals. The\nz-scores of height-for-age that were less than 2 SD below the\nreference median served to define stunted individuals.\nStatistical methods\nIn order to examine the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of anaemia,\nwasting and stunting, we tested a range of different approaches of\nstatistical modeling to correctly identify individuals who have had\nhigher morbidity as assessed from the outcomes aforementioned.\nBecause the modeling of the between school variation through\nrandom effects logistic regressions did not prove appropriate for\nthe statistical analysis of our data, we also employed the\nGeneralized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach whenever this\nwas analytically possible. If the GEE algorithm did not converge,\nwe used conventional logistic regression models. The GEE method\ndoes not explicitly model between-cluster variation; instead it\nfocuses on and it estimates its counterpart, the within-cluster\nsimilarity of the residuals; it then uses this estimated correlation to\nreestimate the regression parameters and to calculate standard\nerrors which are reasonably accurate and hence lead to the\ngeneration of confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates\n[36]. Data management and statistical analyses were performed\nusing SAS V9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\nFor all the odds ratios studied, we fitted the random effects\nlogistic regression models by using PROC NLMIXED while we\nemployed the GEE method by using PROC GENMOD.\nParticularly for the odds of anaemia, we have included as\nexplanatory variable the parasite infection profiles I-III (as defined\nin the previous section); we also consider the nutritional status as\ndefined by stunting as an effect modifier. We therefore display\nestimates with and without considering the effect of stunting; we\nalso included the interaction term of stunting with the parasite\ninfection profiles if the change in deviances between relevant\nnested models was significant at the 5% significance level.\nSimilarly, when we modeled the odds of wasting and stunting\nrespectively, we have included as explanatory variable the parasite\ninfection profiles I-III while we consider anaemia status as an\neffect modifier. Potential confounders of the relationships between\nanaemia stunting, wasting and helminth infection were decided to\nbe included in light of known confounders of these associations\nbased on published literature [11,20,21,37,38,39] and these were\nthe categories of age, sex, and the district where study participants\nwere living in.\nMean Hb concentration of different groups of individuals\nrecruited in the current study were also initially examined through\na random effects at the school level multivariate linear regression\nmodel by using PROC MIXED. Likelihood ratio tests indicated\nthat these random effects were not significant and thus it was\nNTDs in Northern Rwanda\nwww.plosntds.org 3 September 2009 | Volume 3 | Issue 9 | e517\nfinally decided to omit them. However, because of the non-\nindependence found in our data we finally decided to employ the\nGEE method by using PROC GENMOD. We tested as\nexplanatory variables the categories of age, sex, district and\nparasite infection profiles I-III. We also tested the two-way\ninteraction terms of parasite infection profiles I-III with district\nand stunting and retained them in the model if the change in\ndeviances between the relevant nested models was significant at\nthe 5% significance level.\nCovariates in all aforementioned multivariable models with\np,0.05 were considered significantly associated with outcomes.\nResults\nA total of 1605 children and adolescents were recruited, for a\nparticipation rate of 88%, and provided complete parasitologic and\nanthropometric data. They were aged 5 to 20 years old, with a\nmedian age of 10 years and 47.7% of the recruited individuals were\nmale. The observed prevalences of wasting, stunting and anaemia\nwere respectively estimated as following: 8.1% (95% CI: 6.8 to 9.4),\n38.5% (36.1 to 40.9) and 4.9% (95% CI: 3.9 to 6.1). The mean\nobserved Hb concentration was estimated to be 13.8 g\/dL (95%\nCI: 13.7 to 13.8).\nTable 1 contains the characteristics of the study population by\nsubprofile classification infection category. The most prevalent co-\ninfections were those of low intensity of A. lumbricoides and T.\ntrichiura (21.2%).\nThe adjusted ORs of anaemia from the GEE multivariate\nlogistic regression models are presented in Table 2. Deviance tests\nindicated \u2018Model 3\u2019 as the most appropriate one; this model shows\nthat individuals who are stunted are almost 1.5 times more likely\nthan non-stunted to be anaemic (OR: 1.6, P = 0.041). Children of\n11\u201313 years old were significantly less likely than children of 5\u20137\nyears old to be anaemic (OR=0.572, P= 0.026). In addition,\nmales are almost twice more likely to be anaemic compared to\nfemales (OR: 1.9, P = 0.024). Neither the interaction terms of\nstunting or district with the parasite infection profiles nor any\nother examined variable here were found to be significant factors\nfor the odds of being anaemic.\nGEE did not converge for the modeling of the odds of being\nwasted and this is most likely to be explicable by the fact that there\nwas not sufficient information in order to estimate the binomial\nprobability structure by taking into account the intra-subject\ncorrelation. Consequently, we used Maximum Likelihood (ML)\nand the results of such multivariate logistic regression models for\nthe odds of being wasted are presented in Table 3. Deviance tests\nas well as Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC) indicated \u2018Model\n2\u2019as the best one among the tested models. This model shows that\nonly children of 11\u201313 years old were significantly more likely than\nthe younger children (age group: 5\u20137 years old) to be wasted\n(OR=1.8, P= 0.033). Furthermore, study participants from\nBurera district were significantly more likely to be wasted when\ncompared with study participants from Musanze district\n(OR=3.3, P,0.001). It is noteworthy that children with\nconcurrent infection of at least 2 parasite species at M+ intensity\n- that is, those with polyparasite infection profiles III - were almost\ntwice marginally significantly more likely to be wasted than\nchildren with the reference polyparasite infection profile\n(OR=2.2, P = 0.054). Neither the interaction terms of anaemia\nstatus or district with the parasite infection profiles nor any other\nexamined variable here, were found to be significant factors for the\nodds of being wasted.\nTable 4 contains the results from the GEE multivariate logistic\nregression models for the odds of being stunted. Deviance tests\nindicated \u2018Model 3\u2019 as the most appropriate one; this model shows\nthose children of 11\u201317 years old to have significant positive ORs\nif compared with the youngest age group examined here (i.e. 5\u20137\nyears old), (more specifically, 11\u201313 years old: OR=2.4,\nP= 0.001; 14\u201317 years old: OR=1.4, P = 0.044). However,\nadolescents of 18\u201320 years old were significantly less likely than\nthe youngest age group to be stunted (OR=0.4, P= 0.003). Male\nindividuals were significantly more likely than females to be\nstunted (OR=1.9, P,0.001). Study participants from Burera\ndistrict were significantly less likely to be stunted than the study\nparticipants from Musanze district (OR=0.4, P,0.001). Anaemic\nstudy participants were significantly more likely than non anaemic\nto be stunted (OR=1.7, P = 0.020). Neither the interaction terms\nof anaemia status or district with the parasite infection profiles nor\nany other examined variable here were found to be significant\nfactors for the odds of being stunted.\nFinally, Table 5 contains the results from the GEE linear\nregression model for the mean Hb concentration and the mean\ndifferences in different groups of the study population here.\nDeviance tests indicated \u2018Model 3\u2019 as the most appropriate one;\nthis model shows that on average Hb concentration in the study\npopulation was 13.109 g\/dL (95% CI: 12.904\u201313.314). All\ndifferent categories of age yielded significant associations with\nincreased Hb levels compared to the youngest age group examined\nhere (i.e., 5\u20137 years old). Study participants who were stunted\nwhen compared to non-stunted had significantly lower Hb counts\nby 0.270 g\/dL, respectively (P,0.001).\nDiscussion\nConcurrent multiple parasite infections were found to be the\nnorm in our study population, as has been reported in studies\npublished elsewhere [1,2,5,6,9,10]. However, in the current study\npopulation, none of the concurrent polyparasite infections were\nfound to be significantly associated with higher odds of anaemia,\nwasting, stunting nor mean lowered Hb concentration. Neverthe-\nless, results did indicate that those study participants with\nconcurrent infection with at least 2 parasites at M+ intensity were\nmarginally significantly more likely to be wasted (P= 0.054)\nrelative to those with no infection or infection with 1 parasite\nspecies at low intensity, thereby validating the impact of higher\nintensity infections on health [40].\nPotential reasons for the general lack of association of the\nconcurrent polyparasite infections with anaemia in the current\nRwandan population might be that anaemia itself appears to be\nrelatively uncommon in this area. One reason for the latter may\nrelate also to the fact that malaria incidence in the two districts\nstudied here is lower that the rest of the country, as well as to the\ndecrease of malaria prevalence in Rwanda in general as an\nunpublished WHO Draft of Mid Term Evaluation Report of the\nRwandan Malaria Strategic Plan 2005\u20132010, reveals. In addition,\nas Table 1 indicates, the majority of the study participants (i.e.\n21.2%) had low intensities of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura while\nvery few of them had M+ intensities of hookworm and S. mansoni\ninfections. Such a distribution is likely to have limited the power of\nthis study \u2013 potentially making it difficult to achieve statistical\nsignificance where one existed for co-infections of M+ intensities.\nM+ intensities of the latter two helminth infections have been\nrecently shown to be significant factors for anaemia in other\nsimilar epidemiological studies [20,21], and such combined\nfindings highlight how different factors contribute to anaemia in\ndifferent parasite transmission and eco-epidemiological settings.\nIndeed we would recommend further similar studies in the eastern\npart of Rwanda where there is a higher prevalence of hookworm\nNTDs in Northern Rwanda\nwww.plosntds.org 4 September 2009 | Volume 3 | Issue 9 | e517\nTable 1.

This finding might be explained by the fact that the\nyoungest children have recently experienced the high iron demand\nof early childhood. We also found males compared to females to\nbe significantly more likely to be anaemic. A previous study has\ndiscussed that among younger children, boys are more anaemic\nthan girls but the reasons for this remain still unknown [41]. We\nhave also attempted to examine if the differences between the\nsexes in the odds of being anaemic varied by age, but when the\nstatistical interactions of age and sex were included in the relevant\nmodel, the algorithm did not converge. Stunted children\ncompared to non stunted were also demonstrated to be more\nlikely to be anaemic. This result is supported by the observation\nthat iron deficiency which leads to anaemia also contributes to\npoor growth while it has been demonstrated that supplementation\nof iron to anemic children has a positive effect on linear growth\n[42]. The effect of the polyparasite infection profile on anaemia\nwas not found to vary according to stunting.\nWe also assessed the association between the polyparasite\ninfection profiles and acute under-nutrition. Children with\nconcurrent infection with at least two parasites at M+ intensity\nrelative to those with no infection or infection were found to be\nmarginally significantly more likely to be wasted (P= 0.054). This\nfinding might be explained by decreased appetite experienced in\nthose individuals who harbored two or more parasites at M+\nintensity. However, significant differences in the odds of wasting\nobserved within the two districts studied here still remain unclear\nas we do not think that the latter would differ in dietary patterns or\nsocio-economic status.\nRegarding chronic undernutrition and concurrent polyparasite\ninfections, the present cross-sectional study did not find any\nsignificant association with the exception of age and anaemia\nstatus being revealed as a significant factor for stunting. Older\nindividuals, with the exception of the age group of 18\u201320 years old,\nwere found to be more likely to be stunted than the younger age\ngroup studied here (i.e. 5\u20137 years old). This could imply prior\nmalnutrition in these individuals as has previously been reported in\nZanzibar and Burkina Faso [43,44]. Furthermore, the findings of\ndecreased odds of stunting in the older age of 18\u201320 years old\nsuggest compensatory growth in height for this age group and this\nis consistent with results from longitudinal Senegalese data [45].\nAnaemic compared to non-anaemic individuals were also found to\nbe significantly more likely to be stunted and the causal pathways\nfor such results have been discussed in the previous paragraph.\nHowever, the effect of the polyparasite infection profile on stunting\nwas not found to vary according to anaemia status. Finally, it\nshould be noted that stunting - an indicator of chronic\nundernutrition - was the most prevalent form of undernutrition\nobserved in this study. This has been also found by the Rwanda\ndemographic health survey 2005 where the Northern province\nhad the highest prevalence of severe chronic malnutrition [46].\nNevertheless, for the same reasons as mentioned above, any\nexplanation for the significant differences in the odds of stunting\nobserved within the two districts studied here still remain unclear.\nOur investigation has some limitations. As mentioned above,\ndue in part to the overdispersed nature of helminth infections eggs\nin stool and daily variation in excretion, the ideal protocol is to use\nreplicate faecal samples over several (ideally a minimum of three)\nconsecutive days [47].

We are aware that such an\nassessment method is likely to have introduced some misclassifi-\ncation in the measurement of the intensities of helminth infections\nand consequently in the allocation of study participants to the\npolyparasite infection profiles. In addition, although we do\nrecognize that anthropometric measurements should be taken\naccording to the standardized protocols used by NHANES to\ndevelop the growth charts, some modification to these gold\nstandard measures are necessarily within the field conditions of\nMass Drug Administration. Nevertheless, we are confident that\nevery possible precaution was employed by the Rwanda field team\nin order to obtain accurate and high quality reproducible data.\nFurthermore, we believe that is it high unlikely that the examined\nassociations of this study were biased by unmeasured confounding\nfactors such as socio-economic status of the study participants\ndespite the fact that helminth infections are known to be intimately\nlinked with poverty [48,49,50,51]. The reason for this is that\nsurveyed participants most likely would belong to the poorest\npopulations of the country with no significant variations in their\nsocio-economic status and thus with no effect in the examined\noutcomes here. Therefore overall, despite the aforementioned\npotential limitations, this study represents one of the few\nquantitative, comprehensively analyzed studies on the epidemiol-\nogy of helminth infections, anaemia and undernutrition in\nRwanda covering a broad age range with an extension particularly\nin the adolescents\u2019 years.\nIn conclusion the results of this study suggest that low-intensity\npolyparasite infections are more prevalent in Northern Rwanda,\nrelative to high intensity polyparasitism, at least in terms of the\nmajor species of parasites under focus in the current study, and\nsuch co-infections appear not to have, alone, a great impact on\nanaemia and undernutrition. Consequently based on the current\nfindings we would support the argument that sufficient chemo-\ntherapy programmes to prevent high infection intensities build up\nin these people even without achieving parasite eradications,\nshould be promoted. Finally, as currently there is a move towards\ndrugs for integrated NTDs, we would urge for similar analytical\nstudies in order to fully evaluate risks and benefits of such\ninitiatives in helminth endemic regions.\nSupporting Information\nAlternative Language Abstract S1 Translation of the abstract\ninto French by MAD.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pntd.0000517.s001 (0.03 MB\nDOC)\nAcknowledgments\nWe extend sincere thanks to the schoolchildren, teachers, districts officials\nand the population around Lakes Burera and Ruhondo in Burera and\nMusanze districts respectively for their participation and assistance in\nconducting the field-work.
