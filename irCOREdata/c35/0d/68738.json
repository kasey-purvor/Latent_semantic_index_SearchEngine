Like CaP, the\nincidence of HGPIN increases with age and has a higher\nprevalence in African-American men [1].

Similar genetic and molecular\nchanges in HGPIN and CaP have been described [4]. Stud-\nies prior to the mid-1990s that examined cancer risk on\nsubsequent prostate biopsies after diagnosis of isolated\nHGPIN showed a 27% to 100% elevated risk. Since the\nwidespread adoption of extended core biopsy techniques,\nit has been suggested that there is a lower risk of CaP\ndetection on repeat biopsies [5,6]. In fact, some studies\nnow cast doubt on whether isolated HGPIN is associated\nwith a high risk of CaP on repeat biopsies [5,7,8]. Reduced\nrates of CaP detection on repeat biopsies have been attrib-\nuted to widespread prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screen-\ning resulting in early, small-volume cancer at diagnosis,\nand adoption of extended core biopsy techniques that\nsample more extensively the lateral regions of the prostate\n[5].\nAlmost all the recent studies that examine the risk of CaP\ndetection following diagnosis of isolated HGPIN are\nbased on US populations where PSA screening is wide-\nspread [6,9]. The corresponding UK-based experience\nexamining the occurrence of isolated HGPIN and subse-\nquent risk of CaP detection on repeat biopsies remains to\nbe determined. The aim of this retrospective study was to\nexploit the pathology database in a UK hospital in order\nto evaluate the occurrence of isolated HGPIN in a specific\nregional population and, to determine whether in a\nretrievable cohort of such patients who had repeat biop-\nsies, there was a subsequent elevated risk of CaP.\nMethods\nWith appropriate approval from the institutional audit\ndepartment, a retrospective analysis of the pathology\ndatabase was conducted at our institution (Lancashire\nTeaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) for prostate\nbiopsies recorded between January 2001 and December\n2005. Those patients during this period with isolated\nHGPIN on 1st set of prostate biopsies were identified. In\nthese men with isolated HGPIN, the clinical characteris-\ntics and pathological findings from subsequent biopsies\n(if any) were also determined. Patient characteristics\nbetween those that went on to develop CaP and those that\nwere found to have benign histology on subsequent biop-\nsies were compared (unpaired Student t-test). All P-values\ngiven are two-tailed.\nA further sub-group analysis looking at the subsequent\nrisk of CaP based on the level of presenting PSA was per-\nformed to determine whether the risk was purely due to\nHGPIN or possibly due to concurrent CaP that was not\nbiopsied at the time of 1st biopsy. A Kaplan-Meier type\nestimator plot was generated using GraphPad Prism soft-\nware (Version 4) based on this PSA sub-group data; diag-\nnosis of CaP (on repeat biopsies) was assessed as the\nendpoint of interest.\nResults\nDuring this period, extended core needle prostate biopsies\nwere performed in a cohort of 2,087 men, of which 88\nmen (4.2%) had isolated HGPIN and 972 (46.6%) were\ndiagnosed with CaP. In the 88 patients with isolated\nHGPIN on 1st set of prostate biopsies, the median age was\n68 y (range 53 y to 84 y). Their mean PSA before the 1st set\nof prostate biopsies was 11.45 ng\/ml (median 8.5; range\n0.6\u201368.2) and they had a median of 12 core prostate biop-\nsies (range 8 to 14).\nOf the 88 patients with isolated HGPIN, 67 patients\nunderwent one or more repeat biopsies at our institution.\nIn those who had repeat biopsies, CaP was subsequently\ndiagnosed in 28 patients (41.8% of 67 patients). Twenty-\nfour (32.8%) were found to have CaP on 1st set of repeat\nprostate biopsies at a median interval of 13.5 months. The\nnumber cores taken on the initial prostate biopsy and the\nnumber of cores with HGPIN on the 1st biopsy were not\nassociated with subsequent CaP detection (data not\nshown). The isolated HGPIN was originally reported as\nunifocal in 20 patients (71%) who were subsequently\ndiagnosed with CaP on repeat biopsies.\nPatient characteristics between those that went on to\ndevelop CaP and those that were found to have benign\nhistology on subsequent repeat biopsies were compared\n(Table 1). Those who were subsequently diagnosed with\nCaP were significantly older (y; P < 0.001) and had a\nhigher mean PSA (P < 0.005) at 1st set of prostate biopsies.\nPatients that remained CaP-free had on average 1.4 repeat\nbiopsies (range 1 to 3) at a median interval of 13.6\nmonths (range 1 to 57 months) while, those that devel-\noped CaP had on average 1.25 (range 1 to 3) biopsies at a\nmedian interval of 14.5 months (range 1 to 42 months).\nThere was a significantly higher change in mean PSA (P <\n0.05) in those that were found to have CaP on repeat\nbiopsies. Gleason 7 or higher tumours were detected in\n35.7% of these patients who were subsequently diag-\nnosed with CaP (Table 1).\nWe performed a sub-group analysis at different PSA ranges\n(Table 2; Figure 1). At PSA range \u2264 5 ng\/ml there were 15\nmen with HGPIN; 9 of these underwent repeat biopsies at\na mean interval of 6 m (range 1 to 14 months). Two had\none further set of biopsies and in 1, CaP was diagnosed.\nThere was virtually no change in the PSA (mean change of\n0.3 ng\/ml) in these men who had repeat biopsies. For\nthose with presenting PSA between 5 and 10 ng\/ml, CaP\nwas diagnosed in 11 men of the 32 who had repeat biop-\nsies. The repeat biopsies were performed at a mean inter-\nval of 16.7 months (range 1 to 36 months) while thePage 2 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Urology 2009, 9:3 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2490\/9\/3\nPage 3 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 1: Comparison between patients with benign and malignant histology on repeat prostate biopsies\nPatient characteristics Remained benign (n = 39) Developed CaP (n = 28) P-value\nHGPIN at 1st set of biopsies\nMean age (y) 63.5 69.8 < 0.001\nMean PSA (ng\/ml) 8.4 17.5 < 0.005\nMean number of biopsy cores 11 10.54 0.3\nUnifocal HGPIN 27 20\nAt repeat biopsies\nMean number of repeat biopsies (range) 1.4 (1\u20133) 1.3 (1\u20133)\nMean interval (months) to 1st repeat biopsies 7.38 15.11 < 0.0005\nMean change in PSA (ng\/ml) 0.5 4.8 < 0.05\nGleason score\n< 7 na 18\n7 na 7\n> 7 na 3\nProstate cancer-free interval from the time of 1st biopsy, according to PSA levels at presentationFigure 1\nProstate cancer-free interval from the time of 1st biopsy, according to PSA levels at presentation.\nBMC Urology 2009, 9:3 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2490\/9\/3mean change in PSA was only 1.3 ng\/ml in this cohort of\nmen. The cancer detection rate was markedly higher in\nmen with PSA \u2265 10 ng\/ml. For PSA range > 10 \u2264 20 ng\/ml,\nit was 50%; in those with presenting PSA > 20 ng\/ml, it\nwas 87.5%.\nDiscussion\nRecent reviews on HGPIN have found that it has a median\nincidence of 5.2% (mean of 7.7%) on needle biopsies.\nFrom data derived from recent studies, in men who are\nidentified to have isolated HGPIN on a 1st set of biopsies,\nthere is a median elevated risk of 24% (mean 31.5%) of\nsubsequent CaP on repeat needle biopsies [5,6]. Two-\nthirds of the 22 contemporary studies (since 2000)\nreviewed reported the median elevated risk of subsequent\nCaP to be below 24% [6]. In fact, with the widespread\nimplementation of extended core (\u2265 8) biopsies that\nresult in a more rigorous examination of the lateral\nregions of the prostate, it has been suggested that identifi-\ncation of isolated HGPIN may no longer be associated\nwith higher CaP risk on repeat biopsies. Thus, the CaP-\ndetection rate post-HGPIN on 1st set of biopsies may not\nbe markedly dissimilar to that on repeat biopsies follow-\ning an original benign diagnosis [5,10].\nThere appears to be no common consensus regarding the\noptimal biopsy technique and schedule for repeat biop-\nsies after isolated HGPIN diagnosis on 1st set of biopsies.\nThree to six monthly repeat biopsies for 2 y followed by\nyearly biopsies for life has been recommended [11]. Some\nstudies have shown a low detection rate when biopsies are\nrepeated within 12 months after isolated HGPIN on\nextended core 1st biopsies [6,10]. Lefkowitz et al. (2002)\nlooked at follow-up biopsies at 3 years that showed a CaP-\ndetection rate of 25.8%; based on these results they rec-\nommended delaying the repeat biopsies for 3 years [12].\nThere has also been a suggestion for site-directed repeat\nbiopsies after isolated HGPIN on extended core 1st biop-\nsies [13]. Men with multifocal isolated HGPIN have been\nimplicated to be at greater risk of developing CaP in some\nstudies [13,14].\nOur current UK-based study showed a 41.8% risk of sub-\nsequent diagnosis CaP in men with an original diagnosis\nof isolated HGPIN on 1st set of biopsies, which is higher\nthan most contemporary studies examining extended core\nrepeat biopsy techniques [6]. However, this rate is compa-\nrable to earlier U.S.-based study from the mid-1990s\nwhen there was lower level of PSA screening and fewer\ncores were sampled on prostate biopsies [15].\nThe sub-analysis based on PSA ranges showed that the ele-\nvated risk of CaP detection was only observed at higher\nPSA ranges. This would suggest two important findings.\nFirstly, as purely isolated HGPIN should not raise the PSA\nso patients with low age specific PSA (especially in the PSA\nrange \u2264 5 ng\/ml) may be appropriate candidates for repeat\nbiopsies at longer intervals as suggested by Lefkowitz et al.\n(2002) [12]. Secondly, the negative 1st biopsy in the pres-\nence of a high PSA may be a reflection of a missed concur-\nrent focus of CaP and in these patients a repeat biopsy\nstrategy at a shorter interval may be more appropriate. A\nsimilar strategy in the intermediate PSA range (between 5\nto 10 ng\/ml) may be justified as the risk of subsequent\ndiagnosis of CaP on repeat biopsies seems to be still high\n(Table 2; Figure 1). We present part of the data in the Kap-\nlan-Meier type plot (Figure 1); it is important to realise\nthat as the Kaplan-Meier method uses a finite number of\nobservations to provide information for estimation pur-\nposes, one should use caution in deducing important con-\nclusions based solely from the curve.\nThere are a number of limitations to the current study.\nEither due to patient choice or due to their co-morbidities\nor for some unknown reasons, 21 patients with diagnosis\nof HGPIN on first set of biopsies did not undergo repeat\nbiopsies at our institution. Though these patients were rel-\natively older with a mean age of 73 y, no significant differ-\nence in the mean PSA level or mean number of biopsy\ncores at 1st set of biopsies was observed when compared to\nthose that had repeat biopsies (data not shown). In 18 of\nthese 21 patients the clinic follow-up data was available\nand none of these men have shown rapid rise in PSA or\nTable 2: Detection rates of prostate cancer in men with HGPIN based on the baseline PSA level at first biopsy\nPSA range \n(ng\/ml)\nMean PSA in ng\/\nml (range)\nNo. men with \nHGPIN\nMean age [y \n(range)]\nNo. undergoing \nrepeat biopsies\nCaP diagnosis Percentage with \nCaP diagnosis\u2020\n\u2264 5 3.3\n(1.5 to 5)\n15 61.7\n(52 to 74)\n9 1 11\n> 5 \u2264 10 7.1\n(5.2 to 9.5)\n37 65.4\n(52 to 81)\n32 11 34\n> 10 \u2264 20 13.5\n(10.1 to 19.7)\n28 70.1\n(61 to 86)\n18 9 50\n> 20 34.5\n(21.3 to 68.2)\n8 73.7\n(62 to 84)\n8 7 87.5\n\u2020 Calculated as a percentage of those that underwent repeat biopsies and were subsequently detected with CaPPage 4 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Urology 2009, 9:3 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2490\/9\/3Publish with BioMed Central   and  every \nscientist can read your work free of charge\n\"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for \ndisseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\"\nSir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK\nYour research papers will be:\navailable free of charge to the entire biomedical community\npeer reviewed and published immediately upon acceptance\ncited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central \nyours \u2014 you keep the copyright\nSubmit your manuscript here:\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/info\/publishing_adv.asp\nBioMedcentral\nclinical progression to CaP. Also, there does not appear to\nhave been a uniform protocol for repeat biopsies. Further-\nmore, this is a retrospective study looking at a regional\npopulation and, thus may not be representative of the sit-\nuation in the UK as a whole. Prospective or retrospective\nstudies looking at multiple regions may be needed to\nexamine this more fully.\nConclusion\nIn this UK-based study a presentation of isolated HGPIN\nat 1st set of extended core needle prostate biopsies was\nassociated with a high risk (41.8%) of a subsequent diag-\nnosis of CaP on repeat biopsies. Patient age, higher PSA\nlevel at isolated HGPIN diagnosis and higher mean\nchanges in serum PSA levels were predictive of CaP detec-\ntion on repeat biopsies. Based on the results of our study,\nwe recommend delaying the first repeat biopsy at low PSA\nrange and repeat biopsies at shorter interval at intermedi-\nate and higher PSA ranges.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nPBS, NR and FLM conceived the idea of the study.
