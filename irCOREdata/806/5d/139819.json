Under normal service conditions the material is \nusually far below its glass transition temperature and follows linear elastic behaviour. However, \nduring the manufacturing process, the polymer matrix exhibits viscoelastic behaviour which affects \nthe development of residual stresses. If the resin is used as the matrix in a continuous fibre \nreinforced composite, such residual stresses can lead to significant distortion in the final part. An \naccurate model for the development of residual stresses and the monitoring of deformations during \nthe manufacturing stage requires a quantitative sub-model of the gradual evolution of the matrix \nmechanical properties. Overestimation of the residual stress induced during the process can be \neliminated only by considering the actual value of viscoelastic modulus evaluated at intermediate \ndegrees of chemical conversion (degree of cure). Modelling of the modulus evolution is necessary \nfor the analysis of both mechanical and non-mechanical loads developed during the manufacturing \nprocess, due to interactions between the tooling and the often complex material arrangement. The \ndependence of the viscoelastic properties of thermosetting systems on the degree of cure has been \nthe subject of only very few investigations, both in terms of experimental results and modelling \napproach. Suzuki et al.[1] presented relaxation data for epoxies cured following various cure cycles. \nThe cure state of these samples was not determined and the relationship between mechanical \nproperties and cure evolution could not be explored. In a work by Kim et al. [2], a fixed value is \nassumed for the elastic modulus of the uncured and the fully cured systems, while a linear \nrelationship is assumed between the elastic modulus and the degree of conversion, in the entire \nregion between gelled resin and its glassy state. White et al.[3] used a viscoelastic formulation to \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 3 \nstudy warpage and residual stresses in asymmetric composite laminates during  cure, assuming a \ntime- and cure- dependent model to simulate transverse modulus. Investigations of the behaviour of \nneat resin at various post-gelation degrees of conversion under relaxation mode for various \ntemperatures [4] have led to the development of a model of the relaxation modulus at lower degree \nof cure based on the Adams-Gibbs [5] formulation for the volume relaxation in glasses. Yi et al. [6] \nincluded viscoelastic effects in the analysis of residual stress development in laminated plates using \na chemo-thermo-viscoelastic constitutive equation and considering a discontinuous model for the \nmechanical properties with a step at the gel point. O B`rien et al. [7] have reported a series of \nexperiments on the unreacted, partially reacted and post-gelled resin. Simon et al. [8] have presented \na study on the cure-dependent storage modulus of a commercial toughened epoxy resin, giving a \ngeneral methodology to model the time-temperature-conversion effects in viscoelastic of thermosets.  \nThe present study focuses on modelling the evolution of resin viscoelastic modulus during the cure. \nExperimental results reported in a complementary study [9] are analysed in the context of KWW \nmodels which is modified to account for the dependence of mechanical properties on conversion. \nThe considered model uses the concept of principal relaxation time for each degree of conversion \nwith principal relaxation times normalized with respect to the value for the fully cured state in order \nto find a suitable correlation with structural changes. Assuming that the same mechanism of \nstructural evolution governs both the development of the glass transition temperature and of the \nmechanical modulus, an identical \u201cpotential function\u201d can be adopted. This assumption leads to an \nexcellent agreement of the experimental data with the model predictions. These results are supported \nby dielectric relaxation measurements presented in the literature [10]. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 4 \n2 Materials and Methods \nThe synthetic resin system used in the present work was a pre-commercial formulation based on a \ntetrafunctional epoxy, cured with an amine hardener and containing an aromatic thermoplastic \ncomponent. Whilst the exact composition of the resin is unimportant, the blend can be considered to \nbe representative of the class of resins known as \u2018high temperature aerospace grade toughened \nepoxies\u2019. Partial curing of plaques of the resin was performed in a cavity formed by two glass plates \nand an aluminium spacer. Each of the plates was covered with a layer of PTFE\/glass release film as \nwell as liquid release agent (FREEKOTE 700). Five different plaques were prepared following \nisothermal curing schedules with a dwell temperature in the 160-180oC range. The final degree of \nconversion of the five plates as calculated using cure kinetics information on the resin system [11] \nwas 0.68, 0.80, 0.87, 090 and 0.96. Dynamical mechanical tests using a TA Instruments DMA, type \n2940, were performed on rectangular strips taken from each of the partially cured plate. A three-\npoint bending test mode configuration was employed. Each sample was equilibrated for about 5 \nminutes before a test segment starting at each temperature, to provide a uniform temperature \ndistribution inside the material. Three specimens were tested for each degree of conversion. Stress \nrelaxation data were captured during each segment. More details of standard experimental \nprocedures and data treatment for DSC and DMA analysis can be found in reference [9]. \n3 Modeling Results \n3.1 Cure-dependent ultimate relaxation modulus \nThe variations of ultimate modulus were found to be significant and an appropriate model is \ndeveloped to express the dependence on the degree of cure. Within the gelation region, where the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 5 \nthree-dimensional network starts to form, the modulus rises from a very low value of 1.38 MPa to a \nvalue of 60.9 MPa at temperature above the corresponding glass transition temperature. .  \n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1\nDegree of conversion\nUl\ntim\nat\ne\n \nEq\nui\nlib\nriu\nm\n \nM\no\ndu\nlus\n \n(G\nPa\n) Experimental data\nFitting function\n \nFigure 1 - Experimental points and fitting curve for ultimate relaxed modulus \nThe cure dependence of the equilibrium relaxation modulus is modelled using an empirical function \nproposed by O B`rien et al.[7], which expresses the value of relaxed modulus as a function of the \ndegree of cure assuming a very low modulus value before gelation:  \n( )[ ]\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\n+\n+=\nE\ngel\nF\nE\nE\ne\nD\nCE\n\u03b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\n1\nlog         Eq. 1 \nwhere \n\u221eEC , \n\u221e\nED  and \n\u221e\nEF  are fitting parameters and gel\u03b1  is the conversion at gelation (0.66 for the \nresin system of this study). It should be noted that this model is valid for degrees of cure over the \ngelation conversion. The values of the parameters obtained from the fitting of the experimental \nresults are reported in table 1. Figure 1 shows a comparison between fitting results and experimental \ndata for the ultimate relaxation modulus indicating a close agreement.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 6 \n3.2 Shift Factor: results and phenomenological model \nFor viscoelastic materials, the mechanical response is history-dependent and involves the use of a \nreduced time which can be expressed using a temperature-cure dependent shift factor as follows: \n( )Ta\nt\n,\u03b1\n\u03be\n\u03c4\n=            Eq. 2 \nwhere \u03be  is the reduced time, t  is the actual experimental time and ( )TaT ,\u03b1  is the degree of cure \ndependent temperature-conversion shift factor.  \n \nFigure 2 - 3D plot of experimental shift factors vs. temperature and degree of cure \nFor polymeric materials, shift factors are generally functions of temperature; in the case of a reactive \nsystem the dependence on fractional conversion needs to be taken into account in implementing the \nmodel. Figure 2 shows the horizontal shift factors used to generate the master curves of stress \nrelaxation modulus assuming as reference temperature the value of 302 K as indicated by the initial \nvalue of each shift factor curves in fig. 2 and 3. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 7 \n \nFigure 3 - Shift factors for partially cured samples (0.80- 0.87-0.90-0.96) fitted with WLF and linear models \n \nAs in the works of O\u2019Brien et al. [7] and Simon et al. [8], shift factor curves cannot be modelled \nusing a WLF type equation. The Williams-Landel-Ferry model can be applied only to the first part \nof each curve; for the remaining part, a linear shift factor model shows better agreement with the \nexperimental points.  \n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\n-16 -12 -8 -4 0\nlog(a\u03c4)\nT-\nTg\n \n(\u00b0C\n)\n0.96 exp 0.96 model\n0.90 exp 0.90 model\n0.80 exp 0.80 model\n0.87 exp 0.87 model\n0.68 exp 0.68 model\n \n(a) \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 8 \n-400\n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\n-20 -10 0 10 20 30\nlog(a\u03c4)\nT-\nTg\n \n(\u00b0C\n)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n \n(b) \nFigure 4 \u2013 (a) Experimental shift factor data vs. (T-Tg) and model fitting at each conversion (b) Model predictions over \nthe full degree of cure range \nThe shift factor curves for degrees of cure equal to 0.80, 0.87, 0.90 and 0.96 are illustrated in figure \n3, alongside a linear and a WLF model fit in the high and low temperature region respectively. Both \nparts of each curve show very good agreement. Comparisons of these curves with the \u03b4tan  curves, \nobtained by torsional rheometry presented in [10] indicate that the intersection point of the WLF and \nthe linear models corresponds to the onset of the post cure reaction. \nPresenting experimental shift factors as a function of the difference gTT \u2212 , where T  is the test \ntemperature and gT  the glass transition temperature for the corresponding level of conversion, \nallows the use of the following expression to model the shift factors upon the degree of cure and \ntemperature: \n( ) ( )( )gCC TTCCCC\naC\nC\naC \u2212+\u22c5++\u22c5=\n\u22c5+\n\u22c5\n+\n+\u22c5 8721\n4\n3\n9 651\nlog \u03b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n    Eq.3 \nThe fit of the model presented in eq. 3 to experimental data, as obtained using the generalised \nreduced gradient nonlinear optimisation method implemented in the solver of Microsoft Excel, is \nillustrated in figure 4.a. The values of the nine parameters of the model are given in table 2. The \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 9 \npredictions of the model described by eq. 3 over the whole degree of cure range are shown in figure \n4.b. It has to be noticed that at this stage, Eq. 3, was build without any physical meaning associated \nwith the conversion dependent modulus. \n3.3 Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts Model (KWW) \nThe time-dependent properties (mechanical, dielectric, thermal) of glass-forming materials (organic, \nmineral and metallic) follow the stretched exponential or so-called Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts [12-\n15] function (KWW). For a generic polymer system the modulus can be written as follows: \n( )\n\u03b2\n\u03c4 \u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\u22c5=\np\nt\neEtE           Eq. 4 \nwhere \u03b2  and p\u03c4 , are two constants characteristic of the material and \u221eE  is the fully relaxed \nmodulus. The physical meaning of the two parameters can be identified by considering the \ncharacteristic bell shape of the relaxation time distribution associated with the curve of relaxation \nmodulus. The value of p\u03c4  (called the characteristic relaxation time) represents the central point of \nthe time distribution function, whereas \u03b2  (called the non-exponential parameter) is inversely related \nto the breadth of the relaxation time distribution. The non-exponential parameter, ranges from 0 to 1, \nwith 1=\u03b2  corresponding to a single-relaxation time Debye response. Lower values of \u03b2  typically \nreflect increased intermolecular co-operativity as influenced by the chemical structure of the \npolymer, as well as potential constraints owing to the presence of crystallinity or crosslinks [16]. \nFitting of the experimental master curves was carried out using the Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear \nleast squares fitting algorithm implemented in Origin v6.0; the values of the KWW parameters for \neach degree of cure are reported in Table 3. A high correlation coefficient of about 0.999 has been \nobtained. Artificial points have been added in order to force the fitting within the glassy state, \nadopting an average value of 3.43 GPa for the glassy relaxation modulus.  \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 10 \nEq. 4 implies that different materials are characterised by distinct values of the parameters \u03b2  and \np\u03c4 . The same assumption can be made for the resin during the cure: at each degree of cure a pair of \nKWW parameters ( )p\u03c4\u03b2 ,   can be evaluated. Consequently, a functional dependence for the values \nof these parameters on the degree of cure can be established. For a given reference temperature, \nrefT , and by using different values of the parameters ( )p\u03c4\u03b2 ,  for each degree of cure, the following \ngeneral form of degree a cure dependent KWW model is obtained: \n( ) ( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03c4\n\u03b1\u03be\n\u03b1\u03b1\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\u22c5=\np\nTt\neETtE\n,,\n,,         Eq. 5 \nThe dependence of parameters \u03b2  and p\u03c4  on the degree of cure has not been investigated widely. \nHowever, Mijovic et al. [10] have obtained satisfactory results using a simple linear model for the \nnon-exponential parameter \u03b2 , as follows: \n( ) \u03b2\u03b2 \u03b1\u03b1\u03b2 21 cc +\u22c5=           Eq. 6 \nwhere \u03b21c  and \u03b22c  are fitting parameters. Figure 5 shows the linear fit for the values reported in \nTable 3, with parameters \u03b21c , \u03b22c  equal to -0.377 and 0.522 respectively. The increase in the \nbreadth of the relaxation time distribution implied by this dependence is related to the increase in the \ncomplexity of the polymer network during cure which leads to a reduction in the mobility of the \npolymer molecules. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 11 \n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00\nDegree of conversion\nBe\nta\n \npa\nra\nm\ne\nte\nr,\n \n \nFigure 5 - Linear fitting of the beta parameter values \nA direct consequence of the increased network complexity and presence of entanglements is a \nreduction in relaxation rate. For a generic polymer system, stress relaxation time decreases as the \ntemperature increases, with a sharp reduction in the modulus value over its glass transition \ntemperature.  In the case of an epoxy resin under stress, relaxation times increase with increasing \ndegree of cure. Assuming that the molecular mobility influences the glass transition through the \nsame mechanism that controls the stress relaxation function, the behaviour of the glass transition \ntemperature at a fixed degree of cure can be normalized with respect to its value for a given \nreference conversion. This approach leads to the definition of a potential function, which is identical \nto that obtained by normalizing the characteristic relaxation times with respect to the relaxation time \nat the same conversion.

The mentioned Di Benedetto model is a single fitting parameter \nmodel already used by the author for the same material to model the evolutionary progression of \nglass transition temperature with degree of cure, and it can be suitable implemented in \ncomputational routine. The results show very good agreement for the two potential functions, \nthereby supporting the assumption that the assumption of a common effective mechanism that \ngoverns the change in glass transition temperature with the progress of the reaction and the change \nin stress relaxation times during cure. It is important to note that measurements of the glass \ntransition temperature made using different experimental techniques will yield different results, due \nto the inherent time scales, relaxation mechanisms and specimen sizes associated with specific \nmethods [19-20]. In order to apply correctly the assumptions underlying eq. 9, comparisons need to \nbe based on congruent measurements. For this reason, values of the glass transition temperature \nwere taken as the temperature of the peak in tan\u03b4 obtained by solid torsional rheometry. The stress \nrelaxation modulus has been evaluated for all the levels of conversion using the system of eqs. 3 and \n5-7 (or 8, depending on the experimental data, glass transition temperature or principal relaxation \ntimes, used to compute the potential function). Figure 7.a compares master curves based on \nexperimental stress relaxation data and on the predictions of the KWW model, indicating a very \nsatisfactory agreement. The prediction over the whole range of conversions is reported in Figure 7.b; \nthe curves show a gradual shift towards higher values of reduced time as expected and a constant \nvalue for the glassy modulus.  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 15 \n\u03b1,, Tt\n( )[ ]\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\n+\n+=\nE\ngel\nF\nE\nE\ne\nD\nCE\n\u03b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\n1\nlog\n( )Ta\nt\n,\u03b1\n\u03be\n\u03c4\n=\n( ) ( )( )gCC TTCCCC\naC\nC\naC \u2212+\u22c5++\u22c5=\n\u22c5+\n\u22c5\n+\n+\u22c5 8721\n4\n3\n9 651\nlog \u03b1\u03b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n( ) ( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03c4\n\u03b1\u03be\n\u03b1\u03b1\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\u22c5=\np\nTt\neETtE\n,,\n,,\n( ) \u03b2\u03b2 \u03b1\u03b1\u03b2 21 cc +\u22c5=\n( )\n( ) ( )\u03b1\u03b1\u03c4\n\u03b1\u03c4\n\u03c4 p\ng\nrefp\np\n=\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\nlog\n\u03c4a\n\u03b2 p\u03c4 \u221eE\u03be\nE\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1T\nt\n \nFigure 8 \u2013 Sub-model schematic. \nThe computational procedure required for the implementation of this model as a sub-model of \nprocess simulations is illustrated in Figure 8. The sub-model accepts a time, temperature, degree of \ncure point form the process simulation and returns a value for the cure and temperature dependent \nviscoelastic modulus of the thermosetting matrix. \n4 Conclusions \nThe cure dependent viscoelastic modulus of an epoxy system can be described by a modification of \nthe general Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts equation. The KWW model has been implemented by \nintroducing a potential function to account for the structural evolution of the system from a liquid \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 16 \npolymer like to a solid vitrified material. The mechanism of relaxation is assumed directly related to \nthe density of cross-links because of the inherent constraints imposed on molecular mobility as the \nnetwork is formed. The potential function has been produced by normalizing the principal times \nwith respect to the time of reference conversion, to account for the effect on the principal relaxation \ntimes of the polymer structural evolution. The model shows a very good agreement with \nexperimental data for the conversion experimentally examined. \n5 Acknowledgements \nThis work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \n(GR\/M89454\/01). \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 17 \nReferences \n[1] Suzuki K, Miyano Y and Kunio T.
