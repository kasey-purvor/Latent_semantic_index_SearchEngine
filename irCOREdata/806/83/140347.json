Introduction  \nA Product-Service System (PSS) is a customer-focused approach proposed as \u201can \nintegrated product and service offering that delivers value in use\u201d (Baines et al., 2007). \nProduct-Service Systems are \u201esocial constructs\u201f (Morelli, 2006) for realising goals, \ndelivering results and solving problems. To do this, information needs to be gathered \nduring various stages of a PSS. Much like service, information is non-physical, requires \nan environment, a channel and content. Providing information in itself is usually a service \nbut service artefacts may not offer information. Information can be described as useable \ndata, inferences from data, or data descriptions (Ackoff, 1989). However, unlike services, \ninformation flow and exchanges especially in organisations usually require some form of \nintegrity, confidentiality and security.  \nAnalysing information flow in a PSS is vital in understanding interactions involving \ncustomers and providers (Durugbo et al., 2010a). These interactions are essential in the \ndesign and delivery of a PSS for three main reasons: to design and enable \ncommunications and networks for interdisciplinary access\/exchange of information and \nfor life cycle management, to outline information systems for enabling PSS delivery, and \nto propose information flow models that aid service designers in the conceptual design of \na PSS. A PSS, therefore is not only made up of a product and a service, it also needs to \nconsider information requirements to aid the delivery process in an affordable (for the \ncustomer) and profitable (for the provider) manner. \nThis study is motivated by the need to consider information requirements for a PSS in \nterms of information flow and data uncertainty. Ormerod and Shepherd (2004) defined \ninformation requirement as consisting of data required to realise a goal safely and \nefficiently. Information requirement also defines the content of an information system \nand is determined based on system analysis and design activities.  \nThe aim of the paper is to identify and apply an approach for assessing data \nuncertainty and analysing information flow in a PSS. The paper will consider this by \ninvestigating the factors influencing data uncertainty and how this affects information \nflows for a PSS. \nThe remainder of this paper has been structured as follows. Section 2 describes the \nmethodology applied for the research while Section 3 makes use of literature as a \nbackground to outline an approach for assessing data uncertainty and for analysing \ninformation flow in systems. Section 4 presents a case study in which the proposed \napproach is demonstrated. Section 5 presents the findings of the case study while the \n benefits of the approach, implications for PSS design and limitations of the research are \noutlined in Section 6.  \n \n \n2.   Methodology \nThe research was conducted in two phases: literature background and case study.  \nLiterature background: During this phase, literature was reviewed to identify an \napproach for assessing data uncertainty and analysing information flow in a PSS. The \nnumeral, unit, spread, assessment and pedigree (NUSAP) approach developed by \nFuntowicz and Ravetz (1990) was adopted for assessing data uncertainty. This approach \nwas selected due to its benefit in systematically capturing the influence of uncertainty by \neliciting expert opinion and representing it quantitatively. The Info-dynamic engine \nproposed by Sundresh (1997) was selected as the scheme for analysing information flow \nbased on three factors: efficiency, adaptability and reusability. \n   Case study: For this phase of the research, pre-defined sets of questions were used \nto conduct semi-structured interviews with PSS providers about a PSS function involving \ndata and information flow. In the case study, the PSS provider was the Cranfield \nUniversity Library (CUL) whereas the PSS function was an interlibrary loan request \nservice. A total of four semi-structured interviews were conducted with all three members \nof the CUL-interlibrary loan department. Each interview session lasted for an hour and \nthe research also benefitted from documents that were provided by the participants. The \ncontent varied, including: list of uncertainties and number of interlibrary loan requests \nover 2 months.  \n   \n \n3. Literature Review  \n3.1 Information Needs for Product Service Systems  \nWithin the context of a PSS, information about the domain of application, nature of \nbusiness and available resources is required for determining service strategies (Durugbo \net al., 2009). Information for use in PSS design and delivery could include customer \nrecords, machine records, service team records, business records and sales records. \nThe flow of information in a PSS is major factor that contributes to: minimising \nresource inputs and maximising outputs in the form of value (Baines et al., 2007) and  \nenabling communication by means of face-to-face interaction and media forms (Durugbo \net al., 2010a). The manner in which information flows in a PSS also determines key \nmanagement strategies for life-cycles, business processes, value nets, supply chains and \nso on (Mont, 2002, Roy and Cheruvu, 2010).  \nThe analysis of information flow in a PSS is therefore a major design challenge that \nrequires effective techniques for modelling information exchanges (Durugbo et al., \n2010b). The challenge is also borne from the fact that any strategy adopted for managing \nproduction and manufacturing depends on how a product is positioned within its life \ncycle (Meade and Rabelo, 2004). This is because product markets are usually complex \nand fundamentally non-linear in nature. This makes the task of forecasting market trends \nor direction a difficult activity to carry out objectively. Furthermore, service designers are \nrequired to be innovative in the design of services throughout the life-cycle of a product \nto maintain competitiveness in the market (Verganti and Buganza, 2006). \n  \n3.2 Data Uncertainty Assessment \nData uncertainty refers to things that are not known or known imprecisely due to \nissues existing in data. This largely influences the quality of data, which has an influence \non the effective use of information systems (Coulon et al., 1997). This in essence affects \norganisation\u201fs performance as the ability to make decisions, and communicate unique, \nnon-routine, consequential events diminishes. Uncertainty is knowledge driven and has \ntypically been associated with the inability to predict an outcome (Erkoyuncu et al., \n2009a). For instance in the case of cost, data may relate to the cost breakdown structure \n(e.g. research and development, production and construction, operations and \nmaintenance, retirement and disposal costs) of a given project (Curran et al., 2004). The \nlevel of manageable uncertainty can particularly be driven by the process of transforming \ndata into information and capturing knowledge from available information (Erkoyuncu et \nal, 2010). Uncertainty creates challenges in determining the sufficient level of \ninformation requirements for a certain activity.   \nHighly sensitive variables create variability in data where some examples include \nfrequency of the maintenance activity, variation of the assets utilisation or operating time, \nvariation of corrective maintenance hours per operating hour, product demand rate, \nproduct distribution time and the discount rate (Emblesvag, 2003). However, the \nuncertainty issue is predominantly driven by the data collection and storage processes.  \nExamples of data uncertainty categories include reliability (i.e. precision, credibility, \nuncertainty of the information), completeness (i.e. data gaps, inconsistent data \ndefinitions), accessibility (i.e. available, data communication, access issues, wrong \nformat), relevance (i.e. useful), representative (i.e. applicability due to differences \nbetween projects or organisations in time, technology and geographical coverage\u2026), \nrepeatability (i.e. variation in learning curves, consistency and reproducibility of \nprocesses in data collection) (Flanagan et al., 1989; Boussabaine and Kirkham, 2004).  \nFor data uncertainty there is little consensus in how to define the relevant sources of \nuncertainties, their characteristics and how the characteristics can be related for \nuncertainty to be treated or managed. Whilst the uncertainties vary depending on the \nspecific context, a list of commonly utilised methods and tools used to assess \nuncertainties are explained in Refsgaard et al. (2007). This paper adopts the NUSAP \napproach, which refers to 5 qualifiers that are used to qualify quantities: numeral, unit, \nspread, assessment and pedigree. The approach is capable of combining qualitative \nanalysis (numeral, unit, spread) and the systematic multi-criteria evaluation of a given \nknowledge base (pedigree) (Van der Sluijs et al., 2003). It offers both qualitative and \nquantitative dimensions of uncertainties to be displayed in a standardised and self-\nexplanatory manner (Van Krauss et al., 2008).   \nPedigree contains a set of criteria that is used to assess a number of aspects related to \nthe information flow and knowledge used. This approach aims to define the strength of \nthe parameters that are assessed. Assessment of the pedigree criteria necessitates \nsubjective input, which makes it hard to capture objective input. However, Funtowics and \nRavetz (1990) highlight the high degree of agreement on the pedigree ratings among \nexperts within the general area of competence. This is driven by the pedigree matrix that \nreduces the subjectivity by defining each criterion in discrete figure from 0 (high \nuncertainty) to 4 (low uncertainty) with linguistic descriptions for each level of scale \n(Van der Sluijs et al., 2005).  \n As a result, the pedigree is considered to be a robust indicator of the strength of the \nassociated NUSAP assessment. The pedigree criteria covered in this paper are empirical \nbasis, methodological rigour, and validation, as represented in Table 1. This set of criteria \nwas selected bearing in mind the requirements in terms of data uncertainty in a PSS. \nEmpirical basis assesses the degree of direct observations, measurements and statistics \nthat are used in estimating a parameter.  Methodological rigour refers to the quality in \nmeasuring and processing the data.  Validation considers the level of ability to cross-\ncheck the data and assumptions used to produce the figure of the parameter against \nindependent sources. This approach requires the identification and mapping of \nuncertainties. This is commonly achieved through an expert elicitation workshop \n(Stewart et al., 1995). The objective of the uncertainty assessment is to establish an \nunderstanding of the uncertainties that are high in importance and impact.   \n \nTable 1 Uncertainty assessment criteria: Pedigree Scoring \nScore Empirical Methodological rigour Validation \n4 \nLarge sample direct \nmeasurement of \ncontrolled experiments \nare carried out \nBest available practice in well \nestablished discipline \nCompared with independent \nmeasurements of the same \nvariable over long domain \n3 \nHistorical field data and \nsmall sample direct \nmeasurements \nReliable method common \nwithin established discipline, \nbest available practice in \nimmature discipline \nCompared with independent \nmeasurements of closely \nrelated variable over shorter \nperiod \n2 \nModelled\/derived data; \nindirect measurement \nAcceptable method but \nlimited consensus on \nreliability \nMeasurements no \nindependent, proxy variable, \nlimited domain \n1 \nEducated guesses, \nindirect approximate \nrule of thumb estimate \nPreliminary methods, \nunknown reliability \nWeak very indirect \nvalidation \n0 Crude speculation No discernible rigour No validation performed \n \n3.3 Information Flow Analysis \nInformation flow is based on information exchanges in a system and is associated \nwith data flow and system processes (Durugbo et al., 2010b). The purpose of information \nexchanges in a system is to communicate knowledge and understanding (Scheller, 1990). \nThe idea is that data descriptions (information) must be uniform in the way the receiver \ninterprets the data and the manner in which the sender meant the information to be \ninterpreted. Information exchanges in a PSS can be represented by a Data Flow Diagram \n(Durugbo et al., 2009a). Data flow diagrams were developed by DeMarco, (1979) in the \nlate seventies and are very popular tools applied in industry for the development of \nsystems. They are made up of four main components (Durugbo et al., 2010b): \n Rounded rectangles that represent processes (or functions);  \n Rectangles that depict external entities; \n Open ended rectangles that indicate data stores; and \n  Arrows that stand for data or information flow within a system or between \nthe system and external entities.  \n \nFor information flow analysis, this paper adopts Sundresh\u201fs \u201eInformation Engine\u201f or \n\u201eInfo-dynamic Engine\u201f (Sundresh, 2000). A worked example of the use of the Info-\ndynamic engine for a PSS has also been demonstrated (Durugbo et al., 2009). This Info-\ndynamic engine is based on two interconnected or integrated subsystems using \ninformation already in their possession to generate a new piece of directly usable \ninformation.  \nFig. 1: Information Engine Generation Cycle (Sundresh, 1997) \n H1\n \nH2\nN1\nN2\nReconcile \nObtain Data\nAssimilate\n(Information-\nGeneration)\nCrystallise\nA B\nINFORMATION \nNEED\nENTROPY\n \nFour phases can be identified from the model shown in Fig. 1. In the first phase (a-b), \nA is designated the source and B is the recipient of the data. Next, B starts to process the \ndata in isolation. The second stage (b-c) relates to an information transformation stage in \nwhich information is processed with respect to the task to be done. At point c the data has \nnow been transformed and begins the process of being separated, \u201ecrystallized\u201f, into the \nparts usable and unusable for the specific application being considered. In the final step \n(d-a), A and B \u201ereconcile\u201f, i.e. realise a piece of information that B needs, based on the \nprior processes. These four phases of the Info-dynamic engine form the path for \ninformation flow.  \nTwo measures are employed in the Info-dynamic engine: physical entropy and \ninformation need.  The physical entropy can be computed as the sum of the algorithmic \nrandomness and the statistical disorder of a given data d i.e.  \ndd HdKS )(      (1) \nWhere Sd is the physical entropy, K(d) is the algorithmic randomness (or Kolmogorov \ncomplexity) of d and Hd is the statistical disorder that is dependent on the conditional \nprobability of the data set.  \nZudek (1989) refers to the statistical disorder in relation to missing information and \nthe algorithmic randomness in terms of the known randomness (or disorder). The \nalgorithmic randomness (K(d)) for a given data d with length d* is defined as the shortest \npath that  produces d and is calculated as  \nddK )(       (2) \n The statistical disorder (Hd) provides information about microstates that are \nunavailable regardless of the presence of d. This statistical disorder can be computed as \n(Durugbo et al., 2009): \nk\ndkdkd\nPPH 2log     (3) \nWhere Pk|d is the conditional probability of the microstate k given macrostate d \nEach microstate k can be described in terms of this conditional probability (Pk|d) in \nrelation to a macrostate d which it constitutes. A microstate is described here as system \nconfigurations or arrangements that combine to give a system\u201fs macrostate. For instance, \nconcentration of samples (analytes) and fluid dynamic phenomena (fluidics) can be \nthought of as microstates, for which fluids (gas and liquid) can be a macrostate.  \n\u201eInformation potential\u201f is used for the model to describe information held by either A \nor B, which the other needs to complete a task.  An entity with a higher information \npotential can satisfy the needs of another entity with a lower information potential.  \nInformation need is defined for the model as additional information (information over \nand above that already existing in the system) required for realising a goal or performing \na task. Information need is equivalent to the probability of successfully carrying out a \ntask without possession of information m i.e. (Sundresh, 1997):  \n1)( mPN       (4)  \nWhere N is the information need, \u00ac means \u201ewithout\u201f or \u201enot\u201f and P is probability. \n The reader is referred to Durugbo et al. (2009), Sundresh (1997) and Sundresh \n(2000) for the detailed arguments of information entropy and complexity on which this \nmodel is based. \n3.4. Link between data uncertainty assessment and information flow analysis \nWhile data uncertainty focuses on data collection, information flow considers \ninformation exchanges (Durugbo et al., 2009; Flanagan et al., 1989). Information flow is \ninfluenced by the transformation between data and information (Ackoff, 1989). \nFurthermore, the flow of information begins with the received order. Depending on the \nrequirements, relevant information is captured and modelled for use in the project or \norganisation. The modelling helps to plan the information flow for a project or \norganisation. \nThis study identifies data uncertainty as the macrostate used to define information \nentropy in the Info-dynamic engine. To be able to analyse the efficiency of information \nflow, it is important to identify the types of uncertainties. This aims to establish the scope \nof uncertainties that influence data at a given time. The study takes the view that a \nsuitable approach is necessary to recognise the ways to assess and analyse data \nuncertainties. As an outcome, increasing awareness will reduce the influence of data \nuncertainty. \nThe usual response to uncertainty challenges is to manage uncertainty using a \nframework (Erkoyuncu et al., 2009b). The five steps represented in Fig. 2 capture the \nmain steps that are necessary from the identification of data uncertainty to its control over \nthe duration of a given project. Each step has an overlap with the next and may require \nindividuals to return to previous steps to make updates (e.g. in the light of new data) or to \nconsider new uncertainties that had not previously been identified.  \nData uncertainty management needs to capture the life cycle of a PSS in terms of the \ninformation requirement. This is because information requirements across the life cycle \n of a PSS may vary. Depending on the phase of the life cycle, the PSS could be based on \neither centralised or decentralised configurations. For instance, during the development \nphase the PSS may be based on a decentralised configuration to facilitate interactions \nbetween customer and manufacturer (Mont, 2002). Furthermore, for a new equipment \nscenario the manufacturer that developed the equipment may need to provide data related \nto the performance of the equipment. On the other hand, for an old equipment scenario, \nequipment usage and service data may also need to be collected. This necessitates \ninformation flow between the customer and the manufacturer. Subsequently, to be able to \nplan for a requirement it is important to collect (retrieve) data. Additionally, since not all \ndata is reliable or useful (Flanagan et al., 1989), it is also necessary to process the data. \nThis enables the structuring of available, useful and reliable data, which in essence means \ndata gets transformed into information. \nFig. 2: Managing uncertainty (Erkoyuncu et al., 2009a) \nResolve issues deriving from uncertainty \nIdentify\nAssess\nAnalyse\nReduce\nControl\nStep by Step approach to \ndeal with uncertainty\n \n \n \n4. Case Study: The Cranfield University Library System as a Product-\nService System  \n4.1 Introduction to Case Study \nThe Cranfield University Library (CUL) as a PSS contains integrated products (P1) \nand services (S1). The P1 offered by the CUL include books, reports, articles and \nmagazines. S1 for the CUL include book borrowing, technical help to students, \ninterlibrary loans, book purchasing, training, provision of specialist subject information, \nprovision of offsite services.  \nThe focus of the case study is on a function (interlibrary loan service) provided by the \nCUL. This approach to analysing decomposed parts of a system is consistent with \nfunction-orientation (Sommerville, 1992) which is an important approach to PSS design. \nThe case study also focuses on the information system (that enables information flow) \nthat enables the delivery of a PSS. This information system manages exchanges during \ninteractions and negotiations between the CUL and students. The analysis of information \nflow within the interlibrary loan service function could aid the PSS implementer in \n planning and improving business operations in terms of supplier logistics, customer \nability to correctly fill the interlibrary request form and so on. \nThe CUL was selected as a case study for familiarisation purposes, as it is an \nexample that most researchers can relate to and it provides a suitable example to relate to \nwithin a PSS context. The CUL is based on a result-oriented approach (Tukker, 2004) \nthrough the delivery of interlibrary loan services. It is result oriented because it offers the \nopportunity to outsource (activity management) the delivery of journals to other libraries \nand sources, on behalf of the student. The interlibrary service to request a journal article \nhas been selected for the case study for simplicity, because it concentrates the focus on a \nspecific function of the library system. \n \n4.2. Data Uncertainty and Assessment \nIn a library context, uncertainty is created while sharing data between the student \nmaking the request and the librarian who processes the data to deliver an order. Through \ninterviews with the CUL it was identified that there are two major concerns in the process \nto fulfil an interlibrary loan request. First, the ability of the user to place an order for an \ninterlibrary loan request.  Second, for the library to request an interlibrary journal based \non an order for an interlibrary loan request. \nIn the interviews, it was also highlighted that the first point as opposed to the second, \ncreated more data uncertainty issues in the provision of the interlibrary loan service. This \nreflects the significance of the input data on a request form. To further illustrate the steps \ntaken to accomplish the first point, Table 2 represents the steps by which data is produced \nand its interaction with the library database. The user begins the process by identifying \nsuitable journal papers, through the logon screen. The assessment based on keyword \nsearch leads to the thorough analysis of papers in order to realise whether a request will \nbe handed into the library.  Once a signature, to confirm the request is received the \ninterlibrary loan request process begins with the library. At this point it was also \nmentioned that the used processes and tools (Kopak and M25 Consortium) to check \navailability of a given journal within the CUL and across other libraries provided reliable \nresults, and did not create additional uncertainties. However, the only constraint included \nthe case that journals across libraries needed to be catalogued in order for the search to \nprovide reliable results, which was stated to be a small issue. \n \nTable 2 Steps to place an interlibrary loan request \n User (Data) System (Information Technology) \nIdentify User accesses database  Logon screen \nAssess Provide keyword Search feature \nAnalysis Description of material Library catalogue \nMitigate Request details Order sheet \nControl Signature  Copyright sheet  \n  \nDriven by the importance of the received data in fulfilling a loan request, the CUL \nprovides training sessions to fill a request form. However, interpreting a request form \nappears to be the biggest challenge among all processes for the provision of this product-\nservice system. The main data uncertainties associated with an interlibrary loan request \n include: rate of filling data into the wrong box (A1), rate of filling the wrong interlibrary \nrequest form (A2), rate of not filling enough data for the librarian to proceed with the \nsearch (A3), rate of not on system (A4), and rate of existence of interlibrary loan request \nin internal catalogue (A5). \n \n4.3. Information Flow and Analysis \nFor the CUL as a PSS, with integrated processes for product P1 and services S1, an \nInfo-dynamic engine can be demonstrated. The Info-dynamic engine is based on a \npredictive model of P1 i.e. the journal requested.  \nAn information exchange during an interlibrary loan request for a journal offered by \nthe CUL is presented in this paper. Six main steps are identified for a request by a student \nof an interlibrary loan for a journal article as shown in Fig. 3. First, the student searches \nthe library catalogue for a journal. Second, the student places an order in the form for an \ninterlibrary loan request. Third, the librarian logs the order. Fourth, the librarian searches \ninternally and externally for the journal article. Fifth, the librarian confirms the order in \nrelation to the journal information. Sixth, the librarian places an interlibrary loan request. \nFig. 3: Path in an information exchange for an interlibrary loan request (a.) Data flow diagram \nshowing actual exchange (b.) Info-dynamic engine representation  \n \n \nThree of the data uncertainties (AS) identified in Section 4.2 are associated with \nrequesting interlibrary loans \u2013 A1, A2 and A3. Two other data uncertainties (AOS) are \nalso identified for confirming interlibrary loan requests \u2013 A4 and A5. \nDuring the information exchange, seven pieces of information (UI) are required to \nuniquely identify an interlibrary request: user ID, journal title, article authors, year of \n publication, volume\/part, ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) and page \nnumbers.  \nSimilarly, five additional pieces of information (AI) are required for a request form: \nsource of reference, declaration if article is for commercial use, copyright declaration, \nuser comments and search type.  \nFor an interlibrary loan journal to be provided, four pieces of information (IS) are \nrequired: article supplier, availability of requested article and location of article. \nThe macrostate in this case is data uncertainty while the microstates are AS and OAS. \nFrequency of data uncertainty for the library system was automatically logged for two \nmonths and used to determine conditional probabilities (earlier identified in eqn. 3). \nTable 3 presents the conditional probabilities which have been logged for use in the case \nstudy. \n \nTable 3 Conditional probabilities for Data uncertainty for interlibrary loan requests  \nProcess Data Uncertainty Conditional Probabilities  \nPlacing Interlibrary loans (AS) A1 0.06 \nA2 0.21 \nA3 0.33 \nConfirming Interlibrary loans (AOS) A4 0.12 \nA5 0.27 \n \nThe actual exchange is modelled by the data flow diagram shown in Fig.  3a. This \ncase study examines the information flow for the library system. This can be mapped \nonto the Info-dynamic engine as shown in Fig. 3b. This is because the Info-dynamic \nengine is initiated by an \u201eobtain data\u201f (a-b) phase as shown in Fig. 1 equates to the \n\u201eidentify journal and \u201eplace order\u201f in Fig. 3a. The \u201eassimilation\u201f (b-c) phase in which \ninformation is generated corresponds to the \u201elog order\u201f. The crystallised data during \nphase c-d is used to accomplish \u201esearch catalogue\u201f and \u201econfirm order\u201f. Similarly, phase \nd-a in which P1 and S1 are reconciled corresponds to the \u201eorder journal\u201f step in Fig. 3a.  \nH1 is the entropy at the point of the interlibrary request and k (see eqn. 3) denotes the \nindividual microstates for the journal (or macrostate) requested. H2, in contrast, is the \nentropy at the point before the journal is ordered and k denotes the individual microstates \nrequired to confirm the interlibrary request. As earlier mentioned the entropy is \ncomputed as the sum of the algorithmic randomness (Sd) and the statistical disorder (Hd) \ni.e. Sd +Hd  \nN1 is information need at the point of the interlibrary request and the value of m (see \neqn. 4) is the number of information items required to distinguish a student user. N2, on \nthe other hand, is the information need at the point when a journal has been identified \nand is ready to be ordered. At this point, m can be computed from both the information \nrequired to identify a particular student user and any other additional or internal \ninformation in the library system used to identify students.  \nFor the journal to be requested, three uncertainties are possible i.e. K(d) at H1 is equal \nto 3. These uncertainties, A1, A2 and A3 have conditional probability values of 0.06, \n0.21 and 0.33 respectively (see Table 3). Consequently, from eqn. 3, H1 can be calculated \nas  \n 25.400.333.0log33.021.0log21.006.0log06.0 222  \nFor the journal to be confirmed, all uncertainties associated with microstates AS and \nOAS are possible i.e. K(d) at H2 is equal to 5. Using Table 3 as before, the service request \nfrequency values can be identified. From these parameters, H2 can be computed as \n13.700.5\n27.0log27.0\n12.0log12.033.0log33.0\n21.0log21.006.0log06.0\n2\n22\n22\n \nTotal information in the exchange is the sum of information for journal provision (IS), \nrequest form completion (AI) and information to uniquely identify a request (UI) i.e. \n4+1+7 = 12 (out of a possible 16). For this case, it is assumed that all information \nrequired to complete a task have the same probability. For AI, the main requirement is to \ncomplete a copyright declaration (student signature) for a journal by the product system \nP1. Additional information is then obtained to aid the delivery of the interlibrary loan \nservice by S1. Consequently m at N1 equates to 0.75. From this information, N1 can be \ncalculated as \n00.4)75.01( 1   \nSimilarly, the value of N2 can be computed as \n33.1)25.01( 1  \nThe value of m at N2 is 0.25 (or one quarter) because the only IS information that is \nrequired from P1 by S1. \n \n \n5. Results- Data Uncertainty Assessment and Information Flow Analysis for \nProduct-Service Systems  \n5.1. Scoring for assessing data uncertainty  \nBy implementing the Delphi technique with all three members of the CUL \nInterlibrary loan services the uncertainty assessment was performed. The NUSAP \napproach provided structure to the discussion as participants filled a pedigree matrix for \nthe given set of uncertainties. The Delphi method aims to counteract the bias that results \nfrom the interaction between group members (Stewart et al., 1995). The approach elicits \nindividuals\u201f opinion and reason for a particular opinion separately, in order to reduce bias \nthat could occur from other members in the group.  \n \nTable 4 Pedigree scores for case study \nUncertainty Empirical Methodological rigour Validation Pedigree score \nA1 0.42 0.25 0.25 0.31 \nA2 0.50 0.67 0.50 0.56 \nA3 0.25 0.42 0.25 0.31 \nA4 0.75 0.75 0.67 0.72 \nA5 0.75 0.92 0.75 0.81 \n \nAlong these lines the participants mutually agreed that A1, A2 and A3, respectively, \ntend to be the most important uncertainties that have a larger influence on the interlibrary \n request process. Furthermore, the results of the pedigree scoring, as represented in Table \n4, highlighted that A1 and A3 constitutes the largest level of uncertainty and A2 accounts \nfor the third largest uncertainty. The lower level uncertainties are A4 and A5 \nrespectively. A pedigree score constitutes an average of the three criteria: empirical, \nmethodological rigour and validation. Furthermore, values closer to 0 reflect higher \nuncertainties.  \nGiven these results, the focus of uncertainty assessment is to identify those \nuncertainties that have high importance and hold a large level of uncertainty. A1, A2 and \nA3, as represented in Fig. 4, require additional effort to manage due to their importance \nand pedigree score.   \nFig. 4: Main focus of uncertainty assessment  \nConcentration\nPoint \nPedigree Score\n \n0  1  \n100  \n0  \n \n \n \n \nA1, A2, \nA3\nR\ne\nla\ntiv\ne\n Im\np\no\nrta\nn\nc\ne\n \no\nf D\na\nta\n U\nn\nc\ne\nrta\nin\nty\n \n5.2. Comparative Analysis for information flow  \nAs demonstrated, information exchange in the provision of the service for the \ninterlibrary loan request can be mapped unto the Info-dynamic engine. However, the \ninformation exchange process could be further optimised based on the identified \ninformation flow path. For this reengineering process, two approaches have been \nsuggested (Durugbo et al., 2009):  \n Aggregating and restructuring information to reduce exchanges; or \n Reducing the number of actors and scenarios in the information flow system \nfor which data collection and processes can be automated. \nBoth approaches as shown in Fig. 5 adopt separate schemes for improving \ninformation flow. The first approach considers the information exchanges during the \ninterlibrary loan request while the second approach is based on the concentration point of \nthe data uncertainty assessment of Fig. 4.  \nFor the first approach (aggregating and restructuring information), the library \ninformation system can be configured as shown in Fig. 5a. Improved information flow \ncan be achieved in a scheme that causes students to supply an ISSN number used to \nuniquely identify most journals. This ensures that a journal can be effectively identified \nby a student in the library (internal) catalogue. \nIn the second approach (reducing actors\/scenarios), adequate automation facilities can \nbe applied to eliminate four identified data uncertainties A1, A2 and A3.  An integrated \ncatalogue (internal and external) can be developed to reengineer information flow. This \nredesigned system (see Fig. 5b) can be configured for students to request journal \n information, search the integrated catalogue and place an interlibrary loan request. Data \nauthentication can be applied to check that the inputs from users are correct. This \napproach eliminates data uncertainty A5 ensuring that a journal can be effectively \nidentified and requested by a student in the library (internal) catalogue. A4 cannot be \ncompletely eliminated because it is dependent on the availability of the journal i.e. a \njournal ordered online may not be physically available at the external library where it was \nidentified.  \nFig. 5: Re-engineering the information flow (a.) aggregating and restructuring information (b.) \nreducing actors and scenarios (c.) optimised information flow \n \n \nInformation flow, in both approaches, as shown in Fig. 5c, is realised in four main \nsteps. Step 1 involves placing an order for a journal. This request would also advise on \nthe available orders and could allocate available resources as required. Step 2 involves \nlogging the order to generate an order ID. Step 3 confirms the order to retrieve \ninformation about the requested journal. Step 4 places the order based on the identified \nsource outside the CUL. \nAs part of the Info-dynamic engine, the value of the usable information can be \ncalculated as the product of the information content and the information need i.e.  \n)()( 2112 NNHH     (5) \nThree Information flow efficiency concepts can also be derived based on the entropy \nchange between H1 and H2 as well as the information need value difference between N1 \nand N2 (see Fig. 1).  \n The first is the Information generation efficiency (IGE) which compares the \nalgorithmic information generated with the total information available i.e. \n211 HHIGE      (6) \nThe second is the Information utilisation efficiency (IUE) which compares the \nalgorithmic entropy for satisfied need with the initial need i.e.  \n121 NNIUE      (7) \nThe third Information flow efficiency concept is the Information system efficiency \n(ISE) which compares the information value generated with the total maximum \ninformation value in the data received. ISE compares actual use to possible use of \ninformation and is computed as: \n)()()( 122112 NHNNHHISE   (8)  \nIn the current configuration for the CUL, the value of the usable information based on \ninformation need and physical entropy can be computed as (eqn. 5): \n68.7)33.100.4()25.413.7(  \nThe Information generation efficiency (IGE), Information utilisation efficiency (IUE) \nand Information system efficiency (ISE) can likewise be computed as (eqn. 6, 7, 8) 0.4, \n0.67 and 0.27 respectively.  \nIn the reengineered information flow, the efficiency measures applied are based on \nschemes to improve information exchanges (Fig. 5a) and to eliminate data uncertainty \n(Fig. 5b).  \nIn the first approach (aggregating and restructuring information), the information \nflow focuses on the provision of an ISSN.  This allows the librarian to concentrate on \nsearching for articles on external catalogues. In terms of information need, N1 is now \nbased on an ISSN and IS, while N2 is concerned with only IS.

Discussion  \nWithin a PSS, the importance of customer value grows as the focus shifts away from \nthe sale of an equipment towards it utilisation. Furthermore, existing research in PSS \npays much attention to the process of defining suitable approaches to integrate products \nand services. However, it has been realised that there is a limited amount of research \nfocusing on data and information flow. The significance of such research could be high, \nas the sustainability\/continuation of customer value could depend on data and \ninformation flow, while influencing the system level of uncertainty.  \n \n 6.1. Benefits of the Data Uncertainty Assessment and Information Flow Analysis  \nOne of the main benefits of this paper includes a simple measure to calculate the \ninformation flow efficiency (IGE, IUE and ISE) in a PSS, which was applied to a case \nstudy that focused on interlibrary loans at the CUL. Along with this to be able to realise \nsuitable approaches to manage the rate of efficiency in information flow, this paper \nprovides a method to assess data uncertainty. The rate of efficiency of the information \nflow depends on data uncertainty. The issue of data uncertainty and access to usable \ninformation is driven by the data collection process. Some of the commonly experienced \nissues include inconsistent data definitions in historical programs and the availability and \naccessibility of data. In the case study the Delphi approach was implemented to elicit the \ntypes of data uncertainty. The approach enabled the acquisition of a justifiable list of data \nuncertainties. Along with that, the NUSAP approach adopted in this paper offers the \nopportunity to understand those uncertainties that need further attention (e.g. better \nsoftware to collect data, or promotion of particular data to be collected in a standard \nformat). The three criterions selected, empirical, methodological rigour and validation \noffer a good base to capture the level of uncertainty for a given type of data uncertainty. \nFurthermore, the assessment of data uncertainty is expected to enhance awareness of \nissues and direct stakeholders to implement suitable strategies to eliminate or reduce data \nrelated issues. For instance based on the case study it became apparent that the \nimportance of measures to reduce people filling in the wrong box on a interlibrary request \nform (A1), not filling enough data for the librarian to proceed with a request (A2) and the \ninsufficiency of data on a request form (A3) appeared to be the three largest uncertainties \nthat required attention. Furthermore, information flow analysis to eliminate these \nuncertainties will enable improvements in information flow efficiency.  \nApplying an information flow model such as the Info-dynamic engine in a PSS can be \nbeneficial by offering an insight into system processes and for improving system \nefficiency. As demonstrated in the case study, a path for information flow can be \nestablished based on information exchanges in a PSS. This efficiency is driven by \nincreasing value of generated usable information. Improved efficiency in the case study \nwas realised based on identifying concentration points for data uncertainty and \neliminating identified data uncertainties as shown in Table 5.   \n \nTable 5 Pedigree scores for case study \nUncertainty Original \nsystem \nAggregation \/ \nrestructuring processes \nReducing scenarios \nand roles \nUseable Information 7.68 13.8 4.03 \nInformation Generation \nEfficiency (IGE) \n0.4 0.4 1 \nInformation Utilisation \nEfficiency (IUE) \n0.67 0.8 0.67 \nInformation System \nEfficiency (ISE) \n0.27 0.32 0.67 \n \nIn the suggested \u201einformation aggregation\/restructuring\u201f scheme, the efficiency of the \ninformation utilisation was optimised from an efficiency value (IUE) of 0.67 to 0.80. \nSimilarly, the efficiency of the information system was improved from an efficiency \n value (ISE) of 0.27 to 0.32. Alternatively, optimisation of information flow could be \nrealised in automation schemes to reduce actors and scenarios. This \u201ereduce actors and \nscenarios\u201f approach further increased the overall efficiency of the information system \n(0.67) when compared to the original system (0.27) or the information aggregation and \nrestructuring scheme (0.32).  \nThese improvements are possible at the expense or tradeoffs for increased or \ndecreased usable information. In the \u201einformation aggregation\/restructuring\u201f scheme, \nusable information is increased to a value of 13.8 whereas in the \u201ereduce actors and \nscenarios\u201f approach usable information is decreased to a value of 4.03 (see Table 5).   \nAdditionally, the Pedigree scoring for data uncertainty helps to gain better \nunderstanding of information flow. The approach enhances the efficiency across \nprocesses within the architecture within the PSS (e.g. in delivering satisfactory \ninterlibrary loan requests). Along with this, it offers the opportunity to conduct \ncomparative analysis prior to a redesign scheme being put in place.  \n \n6.2. Implications for the Design of Product-Service Systems \nKomoto et al. (2005) contend that the wide spread adoption of the PSS approach will \nultimately depend on the establishment of technically sound modelling methodologies. \nDriven by this assertion, this paper has attempted to identify and apply data uncertainty \nand information flow for a PSS. \nAs shown in the case study, data uncertainty assessment and information flow \nanalysis can be combined to improve specific functions of a PSS, and offer some useful \nmeasures for system performance. Some simple steps such as aggregating and \nrestructuring processes could then be applied to eliminate uncertainty and improve \nefficiency of information flow.  \nIn a PSS, the assessment of data uncertainty can influence the way in which the \nfunction-orientation can be carried out. It is the performance of each subsystem that feeds \ninto the overall performance of satisfying customers through value delivery (Roy and \nCheruvu, 2010). Data uncertainty represents the inability to rely on the assessment of the \nperformance of a given subsystem. Furthermore, the level of data uncertainty highly \ndepends on the data collection process. The stakeholders in the data collection process \nneed to take into consideration issues such as accuracy and availability of data. The \nstakeholders within the data collection process also need to consider factors that influence \nthe credibility of data. These may require consideration of data definitions, scope of \nhistorical data, and the sharing of data through corporate level software packages. This \ninfluences the organiser of a PSS to take measures that enable the delivery of value to the \ncustomer with higher certainty. Thus, the assessment of data uncertainty provides a \nsuitable approach to consider the important subsystems that are prone to higher \nuncertainty. As a result, this will provide an approach to potentially redesign systems or \ndevelop new systems.  \nA PSS as an integrated solution must consider the interaction of units (products and \nservices) from which it is composed.  This process requires consideration for the \ninteraction of system functions and the importance of each function in delivering the \nvalue in a PSS. Furthermore, this will need to capture the interactions across functions \nand understand the interdependencies between tasks in order to become aware of the \ncombined influence of data uncertainty. Information flows could offer useful avenues for \nrealising interactions in a PSS. Information exchanges in modern organisations are \n characterised by a collaboration of human judgement and computational facilities (Patel \net al., 1996). Computation facilities are designed to cope with possibly large information \nquantities while human judgement is used in this context to consider the fulfilment of \ncustomer requirements without jeopardising business objectives of manufacturers. It is \ntherefore important for PSS designers to consider how interacting units such as customers \nwill make use of computation facilities to access, interpret and deliver information. For \nthe case study of the CUL as a PSS, possible considerations could involve suggesting \nnew journals to users based on profiles that are developed by the library.  \n \n6.3. Limitation of the Study \nThe Info-dynamic engine that has been used in the case study is a tool for modelling \ninformation flow at a high-level of abstraction. Furthermore, the tool is limited to a \nsequential representation of information flow extracted from information exchanges \n(Durugbo et al., 2009). The engine analyses information flow for the delivery of a PSS \nbut factors such as criticality or timing of the information for the delivery of a service are \nneither identified nor supported. It is also vital to note that a comprehensive approach to \nmodelling information is also required to define aspects of information such as \ninformation structure and information content. \nAdopting the NUSAP approach necessitates some form of training for the participants \nto score the criteria within the Pedigree matrix. The case study showed that participants at \nthe library found difficulties scoring the criterion within the limited time that was \nallocated. Furthermore, the approach due to the limited amount of available data, \nuncertainty requires human judgment to identify the causes and types of data uncertainty \nand inefficiencies in information flow.  \n \n \n7. Conclusions  \nThis paper proposes an approach for assessing data uncertainty and for analysing \ninformation flow in a PSS, for which a library system was selected as a case study. An \nintegrated approach was adopted based on data uncertainty during data collection and \ninformation flow during information exchanges. Furthermore, it is envisaged that by \nadopting the methodology suggested in this paper it will be possible to improve the \ndelivery of a PSS. This was demonstrated in the paper by means of a prioritisation of data \nuncertainty and enhancement of the efficiency of information flow for the PSS library \ncase study.    \nThe case study involved three main steps for a library system that focused on \ninterlibrary loans. Firstly the Delphi method was applied to capture data uncertainties that \narise in delivering the interlibrary loan service. This step also involved the development \nof data flow diagrams to represent information exchanges. Secondly, the paper \nimplemented the NUSAP approach to rank uncertainties. For this purpose, the types of \nuncertainties that were identified through the Delphi approach were focused on. Thirdly, \nthe Info-dynamic Engine was applied to compare the efficiency of the original system \nand to reengineer the system based on the uncertainties that were identified. The case \nstudy suggests that a combination of data uncertainty and information flow analysis could \nbe applied to improve a specific function of a PSS.  \n For future work, the research will look into improvements for the methods that have \nbeen suggested in this paper. Along with this, further considerations are necessary to \nconsider the gap and synergy between information flow and data uncertainty. The case \nstudy fits into the use-oriented context of a PSS, it would also be useful to consider the \napproach for product and result oriented models in a PSS. In terms of the case study the \ninterest could expand from the interlibrary loan focus to capture other products and \nservices that are offered within the library.   \n \n8.
