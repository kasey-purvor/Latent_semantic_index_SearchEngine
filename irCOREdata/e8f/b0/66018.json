The estimated duration of the Howieson\u201fs Poort industry at Border Cave is 29 \ndemonstrated to have significant uncertainty, and the ESR dates, even with the 30 \nincreased precision of this analysis, are unable to decide between hypotheses that the 31 \nindustry lasted 10ka and that it lasted 20ka. 32 \nKeywords: ESR dating, Bayesian analysis, stratigraphy, Border Cave 33 \n1. Introduction 34 \nArchaeologists and geologists have recognized for many years that chronometric dates 35 \nand stratigraphic information need to be combined, if only to establish that the ordering 36 \nof samples according to stratigraphy agrees with their ordering by chronometry. The last 37 \nfifteen years have seen the development and now the routine application of Bayesian 38 \nchronological modelling as means to go beyond this and actually use the stratigraphic 39 \n(or other) prior chronological information to constrain and inform the quantitative 40 \n- 3 - \nestimates of time from radiocarbon dates on Holocene archaeological sites (see Buck, 41 \n2003) and extension of the idea to archaeomagnetic dating has been proposed (Lanos, 42 \n2001; 2003). The basic idea is a simple one and may be expressed as a form of Bayes' 43 \ntheorem:  44 \n p(dates | chronometric data)  p(chronometric data | dates)  p(dates) 45 \nwhere p(\u00b7) represents the probability of something, and the symbol | indicates that the 46 \nprobability is conditional on the item to the left of it being known.  The dates are the 47 \ntrue dates of the objects in question, and the chronometric data is the measurements we 48 \nmake (in ESR dating or other methods) to estimate the age of the objects.  Then p(dates) 49 \nexpresses our prior beliefs (before obtaining chronometric data) about the probabilities 50 \nof the dates of events having certain values, p(chronometric data | dates) is the 51 \nlikelihood which uses a mathematical model to express the probability of obtaining the 52 \nchronometric data, if the dates were known and p(dates | chronometric data) is what we 53 \nwant to know, and expresses our posterior beliefs about the true dates of the objects 54 \nincorporating our prior beliefs and the chronometric data. The prior beliefs can include 55 \nstatements about relative ordering of events, and thus incorporate stratigraphic 56 \ninformation. In fact a small number of simple components can be combined to represent 57 \nalmost any stratigraphic relationship (Bronk Ramsey, 1995), just as in a Harris diagram 58 \n(or Harris matrix) the stratigraphy of an archaeological site is summarised entirely as 59 \nknown earlier than\/later than relationships or a lack of knowledge of temporal relation 60 \n(Harris, 1989), in a form which minimises the number of relations that have to be stated. 61 \nThe mathematical models so constructed can also incorporate extra parameters 62 \nrepresenting undated events of interest (e.g. the age of the start of deposition of a 63 \n- 4 - \nstratum) and more sophisticated models of the type of processes generating the dated 64 \nsamples (e.g peat accumulation - Christen et al., 1995).  65 \nDates from techniques other than radiocarbon can be incorporated into these analyses by 66 \nexpressing them as calendar dates. Software packages for Bayesian analysis such as 67 \nBCal (Buck et al., 1999) and OxCal (Bronk Ramsey, 1995), allow this by expressing 68 \nsuch dates simply as a calendar date with a normal uncertainty.  This is satisfactory for 69 \nsingle dates incorporated into a sequence with radiocarbon dates, but many other dating 70 \ntechniques produce non-normal uncertainties (e.g. uranium series dating) or include 71 \nsignificant error terms which are not independent between dated samples and should be 72 \naccounted for in any statistical analysis (e.g. luminescence dating, ESR dating).  This 73 \napproach has been applied to OSL dating by Rhodes et al (2003), but it is possible that 74 \ntheir analyses underestimate the uncertainty by ignoring the commonality of parts of the 75 \nuncertainty of the individual OSL dates. 76 \nIn principle this methodology is applicable to any stratigraphically related set of dates.  77 \nExtension from the realm of radiocarbon to the longer timescales of many other 78 \nQuaternary dating techniques has been shown to be feasible, (Millard, 2003) but awaits 79 \nsubstantive application.  There are many questions and sites relating to the Pleistocene 80 \nperiod which could benefit from such extensions.  For example, it is rarely possible to 81 \ndirectly date hominid fossils either because destructive sampling is not permitted or 82 \nbecause non-destructive techniques are unsuitable for producing reliable dates (compare 83 \nSchwarcz et al. (1998) with Millard and Pike (1999)).  Similarly it is difficult with 84 \ncurrent methods to quantify the duration of the deposition of a particular deposit or the 85 \nduration of a stone tool industry.  It is also difficult at times to determine the likely 86 \n- 5 - \nordering of events at different sites, for example, given indirect dating evidence for the 87 \ndates of hominid remains at two sites we cannot quantify their likely ordering or time 88 \nseparation.  However if we could estimate the dates (including uncertainty) of the 89 \nremains using appropriate statistical models, then such comparisons could readily be 90 \nmade. 91 \n1.1 Bayesian chronological models 92 \nIn order to develop suitable models it is necessary to develop an appropriate 93 \nmathematical apparatus for each dating technique.  Given the factorisation in Bayes\u201f 94 \ntheorem, this naturally divides into a technique-independent expression of prior 95 \nknowledge of dates and a technique-dependent expression for likelihood. 96 \nA variety of models have already been developed to express our knowledge of the 97 \ndating prior to chronometric measurements; some examples are given in Figure 1.  98 \nBetween the start of a phase ( i) and its end ( i) it is usually assumed that the 99 \nchronometric samples are randomly sampled from a set of possible samples laid down 100 \nat a uniform rate, though other models are possible (Christen et al., 1995).  In addition 101 \nwe specify that a priori all sets of values of i and i are equally likely between broad 102 \nlimits.  Having specified this prior knowledge, Bayes\u201f Theorem is used to combine it 103 \nwith the chronometric measurements expressed as a likelihood. 104 \nThus to apply Bayesian methods to Pleistocene sites we need only to develop 105 \nlikelihoods for the techniques used.  This paper focuses on developing a likelihood for 106 \nESR dating and explores its application to the dates reported on excavated materials 107 \nfrom Border Cave (Kwa Zulu Natal, South Africa).  Section 2 develops a statistical 108 \n- 6 - \nmodel for ESR dating; section 3 discusses the deposits at Border Cave and a 109 \nmathematical model for their accumulation; section 4 presents the results of the analysis 110 \nof the Border Cave ESR dates using this model and discusses their robustness to 111 \nchanges in the assumptions; section 5 discusses the implications of the results for 112 \nunderstanding the stone tool industries and hominid remains from Border Cave and 113 \nmore widely the benefits of the new method and future work needed in this area. 114 \nA statistical model of ESR Dating 115 \nESR dating depends on the determination of the natural radiation dose to which a 116 \nsample has been exposed during burial (DE), and the rate at which that dose was 117 \nacquired ( D\uf026 ).  A more detailed treatment of the measurements and procedures required 118 \nto obtain these quantities can be found in Rink (1997) and they are only outlined here.  119 \nIf the dose-rate were constant, the dating equation would be simply: 120 \nage E\nD\nD\uf026\n, 121 \nbut because of uranium uptake and the build \u2013up of decay products, D\uf026  varies with time, 122 \nand the age, , must be estimated from the equation: 123 \n0\n( )\nE\nD D t dt\uf026  124 \nGr\u00fcn et al. (Grun et al., 1987) provide solutions to this equation for ESR dating. 125 \nThe sample exhibits an ESR spectrum whose intensity depends on the radiation dose it 126 \nhas received since formation of the enamel.  This dose, DE, is determined in the 127 \nlaboratory by measurement of the natural ESR spectrum of the sample and the changes 128 \n- 7 - \nin intensity of the peaks in the spectrum with the application of additional doses of 129 \nradiation from artificial sources. 130 \nThe dose rate, D\uf026 , is the sum of the rates from a series of sources of radiation, which are 131 \nmeasured in a variety of ways: 132 \n the dose-rate from enamel itself, intD\n\uf026 , determined by measuring the uranium 133 \ncontent of the enamel and assuming an uptake history for that uranium; 134 \n the gamma radiation dose-rate from the sediment, D\uf026 , determined either by in-situ 135 \ngamma-spectrometry measurements or from chemical analysis of the U, Th and K 136 \ncontent of the sediment; 137 \n the beta radiation dose-rate from the sediment, D\uf026 , estimated from the gamma-138 \nspectrometry measurements, or chemical analysis of the sediment, and adjusted for 139 \nthe geometry of the sample using an attenuation factor; 140 \n the dose-rate from any attached dentine or cementum , DED\n\uf026 , determined by 141 \nmeasuring the uranium content of the dentine or cementum and assuming an uptake 142 \nhistory for that uranium. 143 \nAll of these are measured with an associated error term. intD\n\uf026  and DED\n\uf026  have errors 144 \nunique to each sample.  The same is assumed here for DE although there will be some 145 \nsystematic error in this measurement, due to factors like calibration uncertainty of the 146 \nartificial radiation sources; these are rarely published and only constitute a minor part of 147 \nthe overall uncertainty, most of which is due to scatter in the measurements and 148 \n- 8 - \nconsequent uncertainty in fitting a line to them. D\uf026  and D\uf026  determinations usually 149 \napply to groups of dates, so their errors are not independent (i.e. they are correlated or 150 \n\u201csystematic\u201d) between samples in a group.  Such dependence needs to be taken into 151 \naccount in any analysis of dates.  The values of intD\n\uf026  and DED\n\uf026  may have additional 152 \nuncertainty due to the unknown mode of uranium-uptake, but this will be sample 153 \nspecific.  The forms used are usually early uptake (i.e. all U taken up at the time of 154 \nburial) or linear uptake (U taken up at a constant rate since burial).  More complex 155 \nanalyses combine ESR measurements with uranium-series measurements, to constrain 156 \nthe possibilities for U uptake.   157 \nA likelihood for ESR dating 158 \nThe likelihood expresses the probability of the observed DE values if we knew the true 159 \ndate and the true values of the components of the dose rate.  Consideration of the 160 \ncomponents of the dose rate shows that where there are multiple samples they fall into a 161 \nhierarchy of groups for these parameters (Figure 2), and therefore also for the associated 162 \nuncertainties.  Until recently (Gr\u00fcn et al., 2003) analyses of ESR dates treated all dates 163 \nas independent estimates, however it is important to distinguish between dates on 164 \nseveral teeth and dates on several samples from a single tooth.  In the latter case, the 165 \ntrue date underlying the ESR dates must be the same and many of the parameters are the 166 \nsame, so the uncertainty estimates are not independent; in the former case the true dates 167 \nmay differ, but there may be common parameters in the date estimation and therefore 168 \nthe uncertainty estimates are not entirely independent.  It is clear that the values for 169 \nintD\n\uf026 , DED\n\uf026 , and the beta attenuation factor are unique to a measured sample, whilst one 170 \ntrue (but unknown) date, , is shared by samples from the same tooth.  The other 171 \n- 9 - \nparameters derive from measurements on the environment around the samples and are 172 \ncommon to different sets of samples.  The beta dose-rate from the sediment is estimated 173 \nfrom a chemical analysis of the sediment, and is usually applied to several sub-samples 174 \nof one tooth, or even to several different teeth.  However, this assumes that the sediment 175 \nis homogeneous enough that the single chemical analysis is representative of the dose-176 \nrates received by all samples, which may well not be true.  Sediment heterogeneity as a 177 \npotential source of uncertainty is currently not included in ESR date calculations, 178 \nthough it may account for some of the observed scatter in dates from sub-samples of 179 \none tooth.  Here I follow the assumption that the beta dose-rate from the sediment is 180 \ncommon to a group of samples from the same sediment, but each experiences a different 181 \nattenuation to give D\uf026 .  Similar considerations apply to the possible heterogeneity of 182 \ngamma dose-rates, but on a larger spatial scale.  Again these uncertainties are currently 183 \nunquantified and so I follow the usual assumption that the gamma dose-rate, D\uf026 , is 184 \nhomogenous on a larger spatial scale, often for all samples from a stratum; this implies 185 \nthat all samples with the same unattenuated sediment beta dose-rate will have the same 186 \nsediment gamma dose-rate.  Finally there is a dose-rate component from cosmic rays, 187 \ncosmicD\n\uf026  which is the same for the whole site, but may be attenuated by differing 188 \noverburdens of sediment for different samples. 189 \nThese differing associations of parameter determinations with different subsets of the 190 \ndated samples are expressed in a statistical model with a hierarchy of parameters.  This 191 \nmodel is mathematically similar to that derived for archaeomagnetic dating (Lanos, 192 \n2001; 2003), though the physical reasons for the hierarchy of uncertainties are different.  193 \nThus the model may be expressed as: 194 \n- 10 - \n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\nint DE cosmic\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\nint int int\n( )\nDE\n~ ,\n~ ,\n~ ,\n~ ,\n~\nijkl ijkl ijkl\nE E E\nijkl l ijkl ijkl ijkl l jkl\nE\nl l l\nijkl ijkl kl\nkl kl kl\nijkl ijkl ijkl\nijkl\nm N D s\nD D D D D D\nm N D s\nD b\nm N s\nm N D s\nm N\n\uf026 \uf026 \uf026 \uf026 \uf026\n\uf026\n\uf026\n\uf026\n( ) ( )\nDE DE\n( ) ( ) ( )\ncosmic cosmic cosmic\n,\n~ ,\nijkl ijkl\nl l l\nD s\nm N D s\n\uf026\n\uf026\n 195 \nwhere i indexes over subsamples of tooth j, from group k of samples with common 196 \nobserved sediment beta dose-rate ( )klm , and from group l of samples with a common 197 \ngamma dose-rate.  Each subsample has a unique beta attenuation factor, b\n(ijkl)\n and 198 \nobserved radiation dose, ( )ijkl\nE\nm .  Depending on the site, the cosmic radiation dose-rate 199 \nmay be common to all samples or particular samples.  The equation as written assumes 200 \nthat it is common to the same groups as gamma dose-rate.  For any source of radiation, 201 \nZ, mZ is the observed rate associated with a true underlying value ZD\n\uf026 , and sZ is its 202 \nmeasured standard deviation.  \n(kl)\n represents the unattenuated sediment beta dose-rate 203 \nto a subsample.  Following the methods used for radiocarbon dating it is assumed that sZ 204 \nis known, and the minor element of uncertainty in this value is ignored.  The 205 \nuncertainties are all assumed to be normally distributed.  Ultimately it is the values of 206 \nthe true dates of the teeth,\n(jkl)\n, and other dates that will be of interest, and calculated by 207 \ncombining the measurements with prior knowledge specified as a probability 208 \ndistribution.   209 \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: The hierarchy of parameters in common between different \ndating samples.  Each inner box is repeated within the box \n- 11 - \nThe Bayesian analysis also requires prior probability distributions to be specified for all 210 \nthe unknown, true underlying values of the various \nZ\nD\uf026 .  Although there may be prior 211 \ninformation on these, the calculations are greatly simplified by assuming that all values 212 \nare equally likely a priori.  In this case, the prior probability distributions for the \nZ\nD\uf026  213 \ncan be neglected and the statistical model simplifies with the reversal of many of the 214 \nequations for mZ given above, so that general ~ ( , )Z Z ZD N m s\n\uf026 , with the slightly 215 \nmodified form ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )~ ( , )ijkl ijkl kl kl\nZ\nD N b m s\uf026 , for sediment beta dose-rate. 216 \nThis set of assumptions and relationships follows those normally used for ESR dating, 217 \nwith the additions of recognising the hierarchically correlated uncertainties and of prior 218 \nknowledge of dates.  There are likely to be systematic biases which are not accounted 219 \nfor in Figure 2, but as these are currently not quantified as uncertainties they cannot be 220 \nincorporated in any calculation.  As always, the results of the analysis cannot be better 221 \nthan its assumptions. 222 \n3. The Deposits at Border Cave 223 \nThe deposits at Border Cave (Kwa Zulu Natal, South Africa) span the Middle (MSA) 224 \nand Later (LSA) Stone Ages, and have yielded a long sequence of Palaeolithic stone 225 \ntool industries and four ancient anatomically modern hominid specimens (Gr\u00fcn et al., 226 \n1990).  The stratigraphic sequence consists of an alternating series of Brown Sands (BS) 227 \nand White Ashes (WA) with clear boundaries, and differing modes of deposition.  Of 228 \nthe hominid remains BC1 and BC2 are of uncertain provenance, they have been linked 229 \nto either layer 4BS or layer 5BS on the basis of adhering sediment; BC3 is an infant 230 \nfrom a grave cut into 4BS which may have been dug during the deposition of layer 231 \n- 12 - \n1RGBS; BC5 has a secure provenance of layer 3WA (Gr\u00fcn and Beaumont, 2001).   All 232 \nthese remains are of undoubted anatomically modern appearance, and thus given that 233 \ntheir age indicates contemporaneity with Neanderthals in Europe, they are important in 234 \nunderstanding the evolution of modern humans (Stringer, 2002). 235 \nThe material culture includes a significant deposit of material from the Howieson\u201fs 236 \nPoort (or MSA2) lithic industry, which is considered by some to show a number of 237 \n\u201eadvanced\u201f aspects with similarities to the African LSA and European Upper 238 \nPalaeolithic.  This industry is thus argued to have a key role in developing our 239 \nunderstanding the emergence of modern human behaviour (see for example the 240 \ndiscussion in Ambrose and Lorenz, 1990). 241 \n3.1 Dating at Border Cave 242 \nThe sequence is dated by luminescence ages (unpublished), amino-acid racemisation 243 \nmeasurements on ostrich eggshells (published only as averages ages for each layer dated 244 \n- Miller et al., 1999), a few bulk charcoal conventional radiocarbon ages and a series of 245 \nAMS radiocarbon ages for the upper part (Bird et al., 2003), and a series of 71 ESR 246 \ndeterminations (Gr\u00fcn and Beaumont, 2001), making it the most detailed ESR dating 247 \nsequence available for any site.  The ESR chronology of Gr\u00fcn & Beaumont (2001) and 248 \nthe AAR chronology of Miller et al. (1999) are summarised as the mean and standard 249 \ndeviation for each stratum are shown in Figure 3.  The radiocarbon chronology is not 250 \nshown as it is currently not possible to calibrate radiocarbon dates beyond 26000BP 251 \n(van der Plicht et al., 2004).  In addition Gr\u00fcn & Beaumont (2001) estimate that 252 \nhominids BC1 and BC2 date from about 82ka if their provenance is layer 4BS, or 170 253 \nka if their provenance is 5BS, that BC3 is about 76ka old and BC5 66ka.  They put the 254 \n- 13 - \nbeginning of the Howieson\u201fs Poort at Border Cave at 79ka and the end at 60ka, stating 255 \nthat \u201cthe duration of the Howieson\u201fs Poort seems somewhat longer (around 20 ka) than 256 \nusually assumed (around 10 ka\u2026)\u201d.  More recently (Gr\u00fcn et al., 2003) have directly 257 \nanalysed a fragment of enamel from the BC5 specimen and obtained an ESR date of 74 258 \n 5 ka, confirming its provenance and disproving claims that it could be Iron Age in 259 \ndate (Sillen and Morris, 1996).  Gr\u00fcn et al. (2003) have also added a cosmic ray dose 260 \ncontribution to the date calculation, which decreases their previously reported ages by 261 \n2-4%. 262 \n3.2 Stratigraphic model 263 \nThe stratigraphic model adopted is a simple one of continuous deposition with no hiatus 264 \nbetween adjacent strata, with within stratum deposition continuous and uniform in rate 265 \n(c.f. Zeidler et al., 1998).  (Figure 1 top).  This is not the only possible model: 266 \neventually it would be worth comparing with a model which allowed for some hiatus 267 \nbetween the major strata, as Gr\u00fcn & Beaumont (2001) suggest that there is evidence 268 \nfrom the dates for four hiatuses, although I cannot identify them visually on plots that 269 \ninclude all dates with uncertainties (e.g. Figure 4 thin bars), except possibly from the 270 \nspread of dates for layer 4WA.  Thus the analysis here assumes that the end of one WA 271 \nor BS stratum is at the same time as the beginning of the next, and that the deposition 272 \nwithin one of those strata is continuous and relatively uniform in rate.  The hierarchy of 273 \nbeta and gamma dose-rate estimates in common was derived from the published 274 \nsediment U, Th & K contents.  The dose and dose-rate data of Gr\u00fcn & Beaumont (2001) 275 \nwere used with the addition of cosmic ray dose-rate from (Gr\u00fcn et al., 2003).  The direct 276 \ndate for BC5 was not included in the analysis. 277 \n- 14 - \nThe statistical model is used to directly estimate the dates of the samples and the 278 \nstratigraphic boundaries, given the dating information and stratigraphic ordering.  In 279 \naddition, it is possible to calculate other figures derived from these dates, giving date 280 \nestimates for the hominids (assuming that they lie within a certain strata) and for the 281 \nbeginning, end and duration of Howieson\u201fs Poort Industry. 282 \nIn order to test the sensitivity of the results to changes in the assumptions, various 283 \ndifferent analyses were conducted.  All analyses were conducted assuming continuous 284 \ndeposition, as described above.  In addition, as there is very little uranium uptake in 285 \nthese samples, the analyses follow Gr\u00fcn & Beaumont (2001) in using only early uptake 286 \ndose-rate estimates.  The primary analysis divided the site by the WA and BS divisions 287 \nof the stratigraphy and omitted two outlying ESR dates identified by Gr\u00fcn & Beaumont 288 \n(2001).  In addition analyses were conducted with the two outliers included, and 289 \ndividing the site into larger units according to the archaeologically identified industries.  290 \nFor comparison, analyses were also conducted in OxCal, treating the ESR dates 291 \nreported in Gr\u00fcn & Beaumont (2001) as independent age estimates. 292 \nBecause in this statistical model complex numerical integration is required to obtain the 293 \nposterior distribution, Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to 294 \nevaluate it.  MCMC is a method for simulating possible values from the posterior 295 \ndistribution and is particularly suited to problems where this distribution cannot be 296 \nwritten as an explicit mathematical function.  Many thousands of draws are made and 297 \nthe resulting distribution of values is a good approximation to the true distribution.  This 298 \nmodel has been evaluated using WinBUGS, a program which allows the MCMC 299 \ntechnique to be conducted in a user-friendly environment (Lunn et al., 2000; 300 \n- 15 - \nSpiegelhalter et al., 2000; Spiegelhalter et al., 2004).  WinBUGS code for the 301 \nimplementation of the models described is available from 302 \nhttp:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/a.r.millard\/BUGS4Arch\/ .  All results are reported here as 95% 303 \nhighest posterior density (HPD) estimates, which is both the shortest range where the 304 \nposterior distribution has 95% probability and a range where the probability density is 305 \nalways higher within the range than outside it. 306 \nResults 307 \nResults derived using the primary model of geological strata with the omission of the 308 \noutliers are shown in Figure 4 as posterior estimates for the dates and phase boundaries 309 \nafter taking into account our prior knowledge of the stratigraphy.  Table 1 shows the 310 \n95% HPD for other dates and spans of interest.  Before discussing these results in detail, 311 \nit is necessary to examine their sensitivity to some of the modelling assumptions. 312 \nSensitivity tests 313 \nThe addition of the two outliers to the dataset makes little difference to the estimates of 314 \nthe parameters of interest, except the dates of layer boundaries close to the dates, which 315 \nshift by up to 3ka, or less than 6%, and whose mean values for one analysis lie within 316 \nthe 95% HPD for the other analysis.  (Result not shown.) 317 \nSimplifying the stratigraphic scheme to the archaeological periods rather than the 318 \nexcavated strata alters the results for the start and end dates of the periods slightly.  The 319 \ndates for the beginning and end of the Howieson\u201fs Poort results in this case are most 320 \nsensitive to the inclusion of the outliers, and so the duration of that industry becomes 321 \nquite sensitive.  The estimated duration of the Howieson's Poort industry is reduced 322 \n- 16 - \nquite significantly for the archaeological period model (from a mean of 14.1ka with 323 \n95% HPD 6.3-22ka for the primary model to mean 7.7ka and 95% HPD 0.3-16.6ka), 324 \nbut increases again when the outliers are included with archaeological periods (mean 325 \n11.5ka, 95% HPD 3.0-19ka).  An analysis in OxCal treating the published dates as 326 \nindependent and normally distributed gives very similar mean values for the estimates 327 \nof the phase boundaries (within 1ka whichever model is used), but reduced uncertainties 328 \non those estimates, as is to be expected when the correlations in the uncertainties of the 329 \ndates are ignored.   330 \nThere is therefore some sensitivity to the choice of model, but in the parameters of 331 \ninterest, only the length of the Howieson\u201fs Poort industry shows significant sensitivity.  332 \nFull results for all models are therefore not shown, and the results discussed below were 333 \nderived using the primary model of geological strata and omitting the outliers, unless 334 \notherwise indicated. 335 \nDiscussion 336 \nThe results show that incorporation of evidence for the ordering of dates is now possible 337 \nfor sites with ESR chronologies, and allows reduction in the uncertainties associated 338 \nwith individual dates, and the estimation of dates for events which cannot be directly 339 \ndated.  These results are achieved by a statistical model with minimal additional 340 \nassumptions (e.g. a roughly uniform rate of deposition in a stratum, and reliability of the 341 \nprovenance of dated samples).  With radiocarbon dates these assumptions can interact 342 \nwith the calibration curve to produce undesirable effects (Steier and Rom, 2000) but for 343 \nESR dates there is no calibration curve with plateaux to cause lengthening of 344 \nchronologies.  Nicholls and Jones (2001) have shown that with few dates relative to the 345 \n- 17 - \nnumber of strata and short occupation of a site, the use of a prior probability on strata 346 \nstart and end dates which is uniform over a large span can lead to overestimation of the 347 \nduration of occupation.  This effect is in principle possible with ESR dates but will be 348 \nminimal at sites like Border Cave where there are a large number of dates compared to 349 \nthe number of strata. 350 \nAt Border Cave the results of the reanalysis of the ESR dates allows us to specify dates, 351 \nincluding uncertainty for the hominid specimens (Table 1).  Previous point estimates all 352 \nfall within the 95% HPD of the new estimates, though Gr\u00fcn and Beaumont\u201fs (2001) 353 \ndate for fossils from layer 5BS appears somewhat old for a point estimate.  The new 354 \ndates have the advantage of a clear statement of uncertainty, allowing better 355 \ncomparisons with other sites, for example, BC1 and BC2, if derived from layer 4BS, are 356 \nshown possibly to be contemporary with the remains from Qafzeh, Israel dated at 357 \n92\u00b15 ka by TL dating of burnt flint (Valladas et al., 1988) with corroborating ESR dates 358 \n(Schwarcz et al., 1988).   359 \nThe statistical model also allows examination of the full probably distribution of a 360 \nparameter.  As an example the probability distribution for the length of the Howieson\u201fs 361 \nPoort Industry is shown in Figure 5.  Evaluation of the likely length of the Howieson\u201fs 362 \nPoort is of particular interest given the debate about its duration.  The results of this 363 \nstudy show that the current dating evidence from Border Cave is not sufficient to 364 \nresolve the question of a 10ka versus a 20ka length.  The value obtained is quite 365 \nsensitive to small changes in the model due to the fact that the length of the Howieson\u201fs 366 \nPoort is found from the difference in dates of two events which themselves have 367 \nuncertainties of a few millennia and changing the assumptions moves the estimates for 368 \n- 18 - \neach of these events by a couple of millennia in different directions.  In fact it seems 369 \nunlikely that ESR dating will ever resolve the difference between the difference 370 \nbetween the 10ka and 20ka estimates for the duration of HP.  Consider that if we knew 371 \nthe start and end dates of the HP with a standard deviation of just 3ka, then the length 372 \nestimate will have a standard deviation of approximately 4.2ka and the 95% confidence 373 \ninterval for the length will be of the order of 17ka centred on some mean value.  With 374 \nsuch imprecision we are unlikely to be able to decide between hypotheses which differ 375 \nby only 10ka. 376 \nAt Border Cave it would be interesting and useful to incorporate all the other dating 377 \ninformation into the analysis.  Unfortunately it is not currently possible to calibrate 378 \nreliably radiocarbon dates of greater than 26,000BP (van der Plicht et al., 2004), so they 379 \ncannot be straightforwardly incorporated.  The other dating information at Border Cave 380 \ncomes from unpublished TL dates, which are not available to the scientific community 381 \nfor evaluation, and AAR dates.  Regrettably the AAR dates are available only as mean 382 \nand standard deviation racemisation values (with corresponding ages) for each layer 383 \ndated, which prevents their incorporation into a model which relies on evaluation of the 384 \ndistribution of dates.  This contrasts with the ESR dates which analysed here which 385 \nwere published with full details of the parameters required for the calculation of 386 \nindividual ages. 387 \nConclusion 388 \nThis paper has shown that the tool currently used in Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon 389 \ndates can be extended to ESR dating, introducing the benefits of stratigraphic analysis 390 \nand improved precision to Pleistocene sites.  With future development of statistical 391 \n- 19 - \nmodels to calculate appropriate likelihoods for other techniques it should be possible to 392 \ncreate integrated chronologies incorporating all chronometric evidence, thus improving 393 \nthe resolution of dating and our understanding of processes. 394 \nAcknowledgements 395 \nThis paper has its origins in a poster presented at the Quaternary Research Association 396 \nDiscussion Meeting in January 2002.
