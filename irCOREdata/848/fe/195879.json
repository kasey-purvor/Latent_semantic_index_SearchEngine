They co-exist with relict FeNi metal. Both Fe-XANES and microRaman analyses suggest that the FeNi metal and magnetite (Fe2O3FeO) also contain some hematite (Fe2O3). The FeNi has been partially oxidized (probably during capture), but on the basis of our experimental work with a light-gas gun and microRaman analyses, we believe that some of the magnetite-hematite mixtures may have originated on Wild 2.

The samples contain some evidence for terrestrial\ncontamination, for example, occasional Zn-bearing grains and amorphous Fe oxide in track 121\nfor which evidence of a cometary origin is lacking.\nINTRODUCTION\nSince the recovery of the Stardust capsule in January\n2006, samples from the coma of comet 81P \u2044Wild 2 have\nstarted to reveal what this Jupiter-family comet is made of\n(Brownlee et al. 2006). Burchell et al. (2008) estimated that\napproximately 1200 particles larger than 1 lm had struck\nthe cometary collector at 6.1 km s)1. The high speed of the\nimpact events causes some processing of the particles\nduring capture. As discussed in Ho\u00a8rz et al. (2006) and\nBurchell et al. (2008), three types of tracks are found in\nthe Stardust aerogel: Type A (relatively slender tracks\nthat taper to an end where a \u2018\u2018terminal\u2019\u2019 grain is found,\nwhich may, however, only be an unknown fraction of\nthe originally incident particle), Type B (tracks with an\ninitially bulbous cavity lined with fragments of the\nimpactor and beneath which one or several slender\ntracks emerge, which again often contain terminal\ngrains), and Type C (tracks with just a bulbous cavity\nlined with fragments of the initial particle). The incident\nparticle may thus break apart during capture and also\nundergo heating as it passes through the aerogel. Hence,\nany cometary dust grain along an aerogel track should\nbe considered as a fragment of the originally incident\ndust grain (which generated that aerogel track)\nand which may have undergone shock and \u2044or heat\nprocessing during capture.\nIn the initial description following the preliminary\nexamination phase, Zolensky et al. (2006) described the\nparticles captured in the aerogel as an assemblage of\nferromagnesian silicates (particularly forsterite and\nenstatite), Fe-Ni sulfides, and Fe-Ni metal, mainly in\nnanometer-size grains with relatively few larger, micron-\nsize grains that are in terminal positions within impact\n\u0002 The Meteoritical Society, 2010. Printed in USA.55\nMeteoritics & Planetary Science 45, Nr 1, 55\u201372 (2010)\ndoi:10.1111\/j.1945-5100.2009.01005.x\ntracks. Similarly Ho\u00a8rz et al. (2006) and Kearsley et al.\n(2008) have shown that the Al foils that held the aerogel\ncells in place collected a similar assemblage consisting\nmainly of Mg-rich silicates and abundant Fe-Ni sulfides\nin micron-size crater residues. Flynn et al. (2006) and\nFlynn (2008) used synchrotron XRF to show that the\ncomposition of the cometary material in the aerogel\ntracks was similar to CI chondrites to within 35\u201360%\nfor the major elements but with more variance for the\nmoderately volatile elements which they showed were\nsimilar to anhydrous porous interplanetary dust\nparticles (IDPs). The presence of refractory material\nand possibly chondrule fragments has been taken to\nindicate mixing between material formed in the inner\nSolar System and less refractory material that\nconstitutes the bulk of comet Wild 2 (Brownlee et al.\n2006; Nakamura et al. 2008). However, hydrous phases\nsuch as serpentine or phases precipitated from\nhydrothermal fluids are notably absent from the\nreported comet Wild 2 inventory and this is unexpected\nbecause chondrites and IDPs carry widespread evidence\nfor hydrothermal action.\nThe Wild 2 results show similarities with known\nextraterrestrial materials, but there are also differences.\nIshii et al. (2008) reviewed the mineralogical work\ncarried out on comet Wild 2 to date and suggested that\nthere were stronger similarities to asteroidal meteorites\nthan to IDPs. Until the Stardust mission, IDPs have\nbeen our only source of cometary material (Rietmeijer\n1998). Westphal et al. (2008) used X-ray absorption\ndata (Fe-XANES) to show that Wild 2 tracks have a\nmixture of oxidized and reduced Fe that is broadly\nconsistent with chondrite-like compositions but not\nclearly linked to any one known chondrite group.\nJoswiak et al. (2008) have shown the presence of\nNa-rich pyroxenes in 15 tracks, also with compositions\ndistinct from those of known unequilibrated chondrites.\nThus, the diversity of mineralogical assemblages present\nin comets is becoming apparent. GEMS (glass with\nembedded metal and sulfide), components that are\ncharacteristic of IDPs have also not been firmly\nidentified or distinguished from molten aerogel (Zolensky\net al. 2006).\nDetailed mineralogical studies of the cometary\ngrains distributed along the aerogel tracks (as distinct\nfrom terminal grains at the ends of tracks) have shown\nthe importance of understanding the effects of collection\nsuch as heating and oxidation or reduction within the\naerogel at 6.1 km s)1. This is discussed in more detail in\nGrossemy et al. (2008) and Burchell and Kearsley\n(2009) and Burchell et al. (2006a). Briefly, Rietmeijer\net al. (2008) and Leroux et al. (2008) used analytical\nTEM analyses of samples from along cometary tracks\nto show that the most frequent microstructure consists\nof a silica-rich glassy matrix containing a large number\nof vesicles and abundant Fe-Ni-S inclusions. This\nsuggests that a large proportion of incoming dust\nparticles were fully melted and mixed with molten\naerogel. The larger particles toward the terminal ends of\nthe aerogel tracks have preserved more of the pristine\ncometary material. This is in agreement with studies of\nlaboratory analog samples where mineral projectiles\ngrains of known composition were captured in aerogel\nusing light-gas gun experiments (e.g., Noguchi et al.\n2007; Ho\u00a8rz et al. 2008; Burchell et al. 2009).\nIn this article, we report on analysis of grains found\nin two tracks in the Stardust aerogel (both grains\nlocated along track walls and terminal grains). A variety\nof complementary analysis techniques have been used\ni.e., optical microscopy, SEM, microRaman, micro XRS\nfluorescence, and Fe-XANES, EXAFS. The focus of\nour work has been the identification of oxide phases in\nthe samples and consideration of their possible origins.\nSAMPLES AND METHODS\nThe track 41 keystone (from C2044,0,41,0,0) was cut\nand prepared at the University of California (Berkeley)\n(using the method described in Westphal et al. 2002). In\nthe nomenclature of Ho\u00a8rz et al. (2006) and Burchell\net al. (2008), track 41 is a Type B, \u2018\u2018turnip\u2019\u2019 shaped\ntrack, where the particle has broken up during impact,\nproducing a large cavity (lined with fine fragments of\nthe impactor) in the upper half of the track. This cavity\nis accompanied by two styli, which emerge beneath the\ncavity, well aligned with the incident impact direction;\nterminal grains can be found at the end of these styli.\nThe sample used here was a 4 \u00b7 2.5 mm transverse slice\nthrough the track, close (0.8 mm) to the track entrance\n(Fig. 1) and as such was a sample of cometary grains\ndistributed along a track. The aerogel slice was placed\nbetween two glass slides with a depression within which\nthe aerogel slice laid. An optical image of part of the\naerogel slice, showing one of the several captured grains,\nis shown in Fig. 2.\nTrack 121 is shown in Fig. 3 and is a Type A, \u2018\u2018carrot\u2019\u2019\nshaped track. Track 121 was recovered from a chip that fell\noff C2005 during the tile removal process. There appears\nto have been relatively little initial disaggregation of the\nincident particle during capture in the coma and terminal\ngrains are present at the end of the track. Gold mounts for\nthe terminal particles from track 121 were prepared at the\nOpen University (UK). These were sent to NASA JSC and\nmicrotomed sections of track 121 samples (C2005,2,121,\n1,0 and C2005,2,121,2,0) placed onto the Au mounts and\nreturned to theUK for analysis.\nIn parallel to the Stardust samples, laboratory analog\nsamples were prepared using the two stage light-gas gun at\n56 J. C. Bridges et al.\nthe University of Kent. This gun (Burchell et al. 1999)\nwas used to fire samples of mineral grains of known\ncomposition at standard aerogel samples. Unlike the\nStardust aerogel (3 cm deep blocks, some of which had\na density which varied from 5 kg \u2044m3 at the front face\nto 50 kg \u2044m3 at the rear surface; other cells had no\nsignificant density gradient), these laboratory samples\nall had a fixed density (27\u201330 kg \u2044m3) throughout which\nwas chosen to be similar to the nominal Stardust density\ngradient. Minerals used were hematite and magnetite.\nDetails of the samples are given in Table 1.\nThe analyses were planned to minimize the effects\nof sample damage on our mineralogical characterization.\nReflected light photography and microRaman analyses\nwere performed before our SEM analyses and\nsynchrotron work. Track 41 was analyzed by micro-\nRaman and synchrotron radiation, the track 121\nterminal samples by microRaman then SEM.\nRaman Analyses at Kent and Open University\nThe use of Raman spectroscopy to successfully\nidentify mineral grains captured in aerogel was\ndemonstrated by Burchell et al. (2001) for olivine and\nenstatite. Subsequent work showed that a wide range of\nminerals could be identified with grain sizes down to\n5 lm (Burchell et al. 2006b). Once a Raman waveshift\nspectrum has been obtained (and the slowly varying\nFig. 3. Track 121.

It was taken from a chip off the cometary\ncollector cell 5. The terminal grains used here were removed\nfrom the end of the track (bright region at right hand side of\nimage).

It was removed from the cometary collector cell 44. (See Burchell et al. 2008 for a discussion of track nomenclature\nand the distribution of tracks in the collector tray. An extended discussion of the characteristics of Type B tracks is given in\nTrigo-Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez et al. 2008.). Our slice was cut 0.8 mm in (gray vertical rectangle) from the track entrance.

Shown arrowed is a grain captured in\nthe aerogel on the wall of the track cavity (the bottom right\nquadrant of the figure is the track cavity, the other three\nquadrants are part of the extracted aerogel slice).\nTable 1.

In this work, a point Raman spectrometer was\nused at the University of Kent to study C2044,0,41,0,0\nand C2005,2,121,2,0.\nThe Kent microRaman system was integrated into\nan Olympus BX40 microscope. The Raman module was\na Jobin Yvon microRaman module, with a HR640\nspectrograph with a CCD (liquid nitrogen cooled).\nDispersion on the CCD was about 0.5 \u2044 cm per pixel.\nThe illumination was from a He-Ne laser (632.8 nm).\nThe full width of the laser spot size was about 3\u20135 lm\nand the maximum laser power at the sample was about\n10 mW. Such a power density can be sufficient to\ninduce significantly elevated temperatures in samples\nunless the heat can be conducted away efficiently.\nAerogel is a poor heat conductor, so care has to\nbe taken to avoid excessive heating effects from laser\nillumination when examining small particles captured in\naerogel, using laser illumination at \u0002750 W \u2044mm2\nmaximum power. This is discussed in Burchell et al.\n(2006b) where, using the same microRaman system as\nhere, elevated temperatures of typically 100\u2013160 \u0003C were\nfound for small (10\u201350 lm) mineral grains captured in\naerogel. These results were found to depend on the\nabsorption power of the minerals. Olivine showed\nmodest (20 \u0003C) increases in temperature during laser\nillumination, silicon carbide had a greater temperature\n(180 \u0003C) and one initially unknown mineral grain\n(subsequently identified as vanadium pentoxide by\ncomparison with similar spectra in the literature, e.g.,\nZhou and He 2008) gave a temperature of 480 \u0003C. These\ntemperatures were estimated from Stokes-anti-Stokes line\nratios in the Raman shift spectra. For particles, which\nfluoresce, higher temperatures were found on average. For\nexample, ruby grains in aerogel showed temperatures of\ntypically 20 to 230 \u0003C, while one grain (out of 15) had an\nelevated temperature under full laser illumination of\n\u0002700 \u0003C, thus showing that, even in a sample of one\nmaterial, small variations in composition or conditions\ninside the aerogel can result in substantial changes in\nheating under laser illumination. Bearing these effects in\nmind, a series of filters were used to attenuate the laser\nillumination during the analysis. The lowest filter had only\n8% transmission at the laser wavelength, and all analysis\ncommenced with this in use. Sample temperature was\nmonitored by using ratios of Stokes and anti-Stokes lines\nas described previously (Burchell et al. 2006b). When\nanalyzing Raman spectra, fitting was performed using\nthe GRAMS \u204432 (galactic) package with an assumed\nLorenztian line-shape for each peak.\nLaser Raman microprobe analyses of particle\nC2005,2,121,1,0 were performed at the Open University.\nIntegration times of a few minutes using a 60 lW,\n514-nm laser, and a 1.5-micron spot resolution were\nemployed. This gave 24 W \u2044mm2 power density, which\nowing to the relatively short integration times e.g.,\ncompared with some of our other Raman analyses,\nminimized the risk of sample damage.\nSEM Analyses\nFollowing the microRaman analyses, the track 121\nterminal samples were studied with an FEI Sirion Field\nEmission Gun SEM (FEG-SEM) and a Philips XL30\nEnvironmental SEM at UL. The FEG-SEM was\noperated at 4\u20139 keV and a beam current of 400 pA for\nimaging. Qualitative EDS point analyses were\nperformed at 12.5\u201315 keV, \u00a3650 pA beam current with\na PGT EDS system on the FEG-SEM. Beam currents\nwere measured on a Faraday cup. The ESEM (with\nLink EDS) was used at 1 torr pressure when sample\ncharging on C2005,2,121,2,0 occurred during some\nanalyses using the FEG-SEM.This was found to overcome\nthe majority of charging problems. EDS analysis times\nranged from 50\u20131000 s for point analyses depending on\nour assessment of sample charging, potential damage, and\nelemental concentrations. For C2005,2,121,2,0 individual\nspectrum X-ray counts from across the sample were added\ntogether to produce a representative spectrum.\nFIB and TEM Analysis\nAfter identification by SEM of iron oxide grains\nwithin a terminal area of Track 121 (C2005,2,121,2,0), a\ntechnique was developed for extraction of one of the\ngrains for TEM analysis. An FEI Quanta 3-D focused\nion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM)\nwas used at UL for sample preparation: milling an\napproximately 120 nm thick wafer containing a cross\nsection of one of the iron oxide grains. The FIB-SEM\nGa+ ion beam used for the milling was operated at\n30 kV accelerating voltage. Prior to application of the\nrun script, the particle was capped with a 10 \u00b7 2.5 lm\ncarbon layer approximately 150 nm thick followed by\nPt of equivalent dimensions in order to protect the Fe\noxide grain from the effects of the ion beam. Both\nlayers were deposited via electron beam deposition using\nthe gas injection system (GIS). The conventional\n15 \u00b7 4 lm TEM runscript was amended to produce\na 5 \u00b7 4 lm sample wafer dimensions required\nminiaturization in order to preserve the rest of the\nterminal mass. A 120 nm thick wafer was produced to\nensure that the particle cross section would remain intact.\nThe wafers were imaged with secondary electron snap\nshots at sequential stages of the milling process and the\nrunscript was aborted before the final milling currents in\norder to help preserve the wafer. Manual thinning was\n58 J. C. Bridges et al.\napplied post extraction with low beam currents\n<100 pA to ensure electron transparency of the grain.\nThe wafer was extracted in situ using the Omniprobe lift\nout mechanism, and attached to a copper grid using\ncarbon welding with the GIS and ion beam at 20 kV.\nA JEOL 1200 TEM with a PGT EDS system\nwas used for analysis of the extracted grain. Its LaB6\nthermionic source was operated at 200 kV and 111 lA\nemission current. Bright field imaging, STEM EDS, and\nselected area electron diffraction (SAED) were\nperformed on the particle and surrounding gold foil\nmount. STEM EDS analyses were performed at 14 points\nin and around the iron oxide grain for 50 s each and X-ray\nmapping was performed with STEMmode for 2 h.\nIn order to check that the Ga+ ions in the FIB did\nnot create amorphous Fe oxides, we conducted\nFIB-SEM analyses of magnetite-bearing symplectites in\nnakhlite meteorites (Changela and Bridges 2009). The\npreservation of the magnetite and other phases showed\nthat FIB-SEM analyses did not change the structure of\nthe FeO studied in our Stardust samples.\nMicroFocus XRS, XANES and EXAFS\nMicrofocus XRS and XANES spectroscopy was\nperformed at Beamline I18 of the Diamond Light\nSource, Oxfordshire. This beamline operates from a\n3 GeV synchrotron with typical currents of 200 mA. A\nSi (1 1 1) and (3 1 1) double crystal monochromator\nwas used for energy selection with resolutions of 10)4\nand 10)5, respectively. A 9 element germanium based\nsolid state detector was used which is capable of\nmeasuring the X-rays of Ca upwards. Energy calibrations\nare regularly checked on I18 withMnmetal samples.\nMicrofocus XRS (fluorescence) maps were generated\nat three areas of the transverse slice of track 41 (C2044,\n10, 41, 0, 0). The germanium fluorescence detector was\nplaced 45\u0003 to the sample with the beryllium window as\nclose as possible to maximize count rates. 250 \u00b7 250 lm\nmaps were produced at 13 keV and a dwell time of 5 s.\nBeam spot sizes were 3\u20134 lm. Long integration times\nof 500 s were performed on hotspots identified after\nmapping. At characteristic energies, called absorption\nedges, the X-ray absorption of an element changes\nmarkedly. Near an absorption edge, the spectra may\ncontain fine structure that reveals information about\nvalency, the electronic and geometrical environment of\nthe absorbing atom. Fe K edge X-ray absorption near\nedge structure (XANES) was performed on hotspots.\nApproximately 120 data points were integrated across\nthe XANES pre and post Fe edge. One second\nintegration was performed at each 0.2\u20130.4 eV energy\nstep from 6962\u20137090 eV, followed by 5 s onwards\nbeyond the Fe K edge extended X-ray absorption fine\nstructure (EXAFS) up to 7500 eV. However, this region\nwas too noisy for successful fitting to the co-ordination\nenvironment for track 41 and so our mineral\nidentifications are based on XANES. A range of mineral\nstandards similar to the phases studied were also\nanalyzed: magnetite (Fe2O3FeO), hematite (Fe2O3),\nMg-rich olivine from the Admire pallasite meteorite\n(Mg \u2044Mg+Fe atomic ratio 0.88), chromite FeCr2O4,\nFe-sulfide\u2013pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS). They were powdered with\nan agate mortar and pestle and mixed with boron\nnitride powder at 5 mg to 95 mg proportions, the pellets\nwere then used for XANES. Samples and standard\npowders were mounted on low X-ray absorption tape to\npreserve their integrity and using this tape, together\nwith the thin aerogel within which the cometary tracks\nlie, means that X-ray absorption effects for elements\nwith Z \u2021 Ca were small enough to ignore in this work.\nXANES spectra were reduced using Pyspline software\n(Diamond Light Source, Oxfordshire, UK), XRS data\nwith PyMCA software. The resultant XANES spectra\nwere normalized by the software to the EXAFS region.\nThe Berkeley XANES spectral library was also used to\ncompare with our XANES results.\nRESULTS\nSEM and TEM of Terminal Areas of Track 121\nC2005,2,121,1,0\nThis sample consists of a 10 \u00b7 10 lm mixture of\nglassy aerogel and a few percent of cometary grains.\nThe relatively smooth surface texture and compositional\nanalyses suggest that this part of track 121 has\nundergone some melting during capture heating. Spot\nanalyses showed that there is a high concentration of\niron oxide grains (Fig. 4). These appear to be pure Fe\noxide; despite long acquisition times on numerous spots\nmost grains had no other detectable elements except\nFe, O with Au, Al, Si resulting from the substrate and\naerogel. As some glassy aerogel was attached to the\niron oxides, grain sizes were difficult to measure\naccurately but ranged up to approximately 100\u2013200 nm.\nA second elemental signature for some grains was\nMg-Fe-O-(Si), consistent with the common presence of\nforsterite olivine in many of the Stardust samples and\ncharacteristic of silica-rich glass in the Stardust samples\n(Zolensky et al. 2006; Leroux et al. 2008; Rietmeijer et al.\n2008).\nFollowing SEM characterization, an Fe oxide grain\nwas extracted from this sample by FIB-SEM (see the\nsection FIB and TEM Analysis) and analyzed by TEM\n(Fig. 4) in order to check its composition and determine its\nstructure. Figure 4d shows an EDS spectrum taken from\nthe grain. The Ga peak arises from some implantation\nIron oxides in comet 81P \u2044Wild 2 59\nFig. 4. a) SE image of terminal area of sample C2005,2,121,1,0 at 5 kV.

Bridges et al.\nduring the ion milling process, the Au peak is due to\nexcitation of some X-rays from the underlying mount.\nSelected area electron diffraction of the Fe oxide\ngrains showed the absence of any diffraction pattern\nand thus the oxide is structureless. The surrounding\ngold foil did, however, show diffraction demonstrating\nthat it is the amorphous nature of the Fe oxide rather\nthan the thickness of the extracted wafer that caused\nthe lack of a diffraction pattern.\nC2005,2,121,2,0\nThis sample consists of a 6 \u00b7 4 lm aggregate of\naerogel and scattered cometary grains. Like the 121,1,0\nsample it contained a dominant Fe signature (associated\nwith iron oxide\u2014see the Raman section below) from the\ncometary grains in addition to Si which is mainly produced\nfrom the aerogel (Fig. 4). However, the surrounding\naerogel precluded imaging discrete grains. Subtracting the\nAu background from an X-ray spectra taken from the\nsample indicates, qualitatively, that it contains S as well as\nFe and Mg. This suggests the presence of minor sulfides,\nalthough these have not been detected by microRaman,\nperhaps because of their small total volume. Such\nsub-micron grains could be fragments that were stripped\noff larger grains during capture. Unlike 121,1,0, this\nsample does not appear to have undergonemelting.\nBoth 121,1,0 and 121,2,0 are samples of the\nterminal areas and thus iron oxides are present near the\nend of this track. A large single terminal grain has not\nbeen identified in these samples.\nRaman\nRaman analysis of the Stardust samples was carried\nout in addition to tests of standard sample materials.\nLaboratory Analog Samples\nBefore considering the Stardust samples, the general\ncase of magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (a-Fe2O3) under\nRaman analysis was considered. The Raman spectra of\nthese minerals are distinct from other Fe oxides e.g.,\ngoethite and maghemite. Raman spectra were taken\nfrom raw grains of both magnetite and hematite (placed\non microscope slides) using an 8% transmission filter to\nkeep laser power on the samples low (see Fig. 5). The\nspectra obtained are typical of the spectra found in the\nliterature for these minerals, e.g., de Faria et al. (1997)\nand the position and width of each peak are given in\nTable 2. For the hematite specimen (Kent micro-\nRaman), the series of seven sharp peaks, which extend\nup to 611 \u2044 cm (what appears in the figure as a single\npeak at 293 \u2044 cm is resolved by the fit into two narrow,\njust separable peaks), are similar to those reported in\nthe literature typical of hematite and are typically\nassigned to the expected seven phonon lines for this\nmaterial (e.g., see de Faria et al. 1997). The very weak\npeak at 661 \u2044 cm is barely evident but is included for\ncompleteness. The peak at 1317 \u2044 cm is also seen by other\nworkers. It has been assigned to two-magnon scattering\nin the anti-ferromagnetic hematite (Martin et al. 1977),\nor more recently to an overtone of a Raman-inactive\nphonon (Massey et al. 1990). The magnetite spectra seen\nhere are characterized by just two narrow sharp peaks\nFig. 5. Raman spectrum from raw grains of hematite and\nmagnetite standards.\nTable 2.

There\nis some discussion in the literature (e.g., de Faria et al.\n1997) as to whether the latter peak is in fact associated\nwith magnetite or represents the presence of hematite\ncontaminants in the samples. Here we find that it has a\ndifferent peak position and width to the peak seen in\nthe hematite at 1317 \u2044 cm.\nAs has been pointed out by several authors (e.g., de\nFaria et al. 1997; Shebanova and Lazor 2003) that laser\nheating of magnetite samples (to 240 \u0003C) during Raman\nanalysis causes the appearance of bands in the Raman\nspectra that are associated with hematite, reflecting an\nirreversible temperature induced transition from\nmagnetite to hematite at around 240 \u0003C. This is\nillustrated here in Fig. 6 where 88% of full laser power\n(i.e., 8.8 mW) was used to heat a magnetite sample to\n205 \u00b1 20 \u0003C and take Raman spectra from it (peak\npositions and widths are given in Table 2). In the Raman\nspectrum from the heated sample, the characteristic\nbands of hematite at low wave shift number are now\napparent, along with (and stronger than) those for\nmagnetite. At \u00021300 \u2044 cm, the peak observed in the\nhematite sample has now replaced the broader and\nslightly higher wave number peak in the original\nmagnetite spectrum (Fig. 5). This indicates that the\ngrain has been heat processed by the laser during\nRaman analysis and (at the particle\u2019s surface) is now a\nmixture of hematite and magnetite.\nThis raises issues with regard to heating during\nanalysis. Firstly, does heating during capture in aerogel\nalter the samples? As discussed later, there is evidence\nthat peak projectile temperatures during capture in\naerogel can reach as high as 2040 \u0003C. In addition,\nNoguchi et al. (2007) report elevated temperatures, and\nmade TEM observations of mineralogical changes in\nsamples captured in aerogel which are associated with\ntransition temperatures of 500 \u0003C (i.e., in excess of those\nneeded for the magnetite to hematite transition at low\noxygen fugacities). These elevated temperatures were\nfound in a surface layer 1\u20132 lm thick of captured\ngrains, whose interiors showed significantly less heating.\nSecondly, we must also consider that, even when low\nlaser power is used, the heating effects due to the\nRaman laser illumination may be exacerbated for small\ngrains captured in aerogel due to aerogel\u2019s poor heat\nconduction properties (particularly for long integration\ntimes).\nRaman spectra were obtained at low laser power\n(i.e., with the 8% transmission filter) from the mineral\ngrains captured in the laboratory aerogel samples\ndescribed in Table 1 and Fig. 7. For magnetite (Fig. 7a),\nFig. 7. Raman spectra of (a) 10 lm magnetite and (b) 10 lm\nhematite grain after capture in aerogel (density 30 kg \u2044m3) at\n6.1 km s)1. In each case, the upper spectrum is in aerogel and\nthe lower trace is from a raw grain for comparison; the\ncharacteristic peaks of each raw sample are still present after\ncapture (and are listed in Table 2).\nFig. 6. Raman spectrum (upper trace) from a raw grain of\nmagnetite illuminated at high laser power (i.e., heated to high\ntemperature). The two lower traces are for raw grains of\nmagnetite (solid line) and hematite (dashed line) taken at low\nlaser power. The upper trace (peak positions and widths are\ngiven in Table 2) can be seen to be a combination of the two\nlower traces, with the hematite contribution dominating.\n62 J. C. Bridges et al.\nit can be seen (Table 2) that the main characteristic\npeak is shifted in position by 6 \u2044 cm. The broad peak at\n1324 \u2044 cm is barely above the noise in the spectra and by\nitself would probably not trigger a peak identification.\nThe increased signal to noise ratio in the spectra is due\nto the grains being observed through a thickness of\naerogel (2 mm in this case, much greater than the\nStardust sample analyzed below) and this is common in\nRaman studies of grains in aerogel. For the hematite\nsample, the characteristic peaks are still strongly visible\nafter capture, albeit again with an apparent slight\ndownward shift in peak position and increased widths\n(similar shifts and broadening have been reported\npreviously when samples are heated e.g., see Shebanova\nand Lazor 2003). This increased width explains the\ninability to resolve clearly the two peaks expected at 293\nand 299 \u2044 cm and their appearance as a single peak. The\ngrains used in taking these spectra were 10 lm in size,\nsimilar within a factor of 2 to the Stardust grains that\nwere analyzed (e.g., Fig. 2). The important conclusions\nof these experiments are that the acquisition of Raman\nspectra does not thermally process iron oxide grains\nsufficiently to entirely change magnetite into hematite.\nAs a further check, Raman spectra were taken for\nlong (20 h) periods, at full laser power (10 mW) on\nmagnetite grains captured in aerogel. Grains about\n30 lm in size were chosen which were near the surface\nof the aerogel and which were about 30 lm in size.\nThese laser illumination conditions exceeded those used\nto analyze any of the comet Wild 2 samples. The\nresulting Raman wave shift spectra are shown in Fig. 8.\nA range of results is apparent. In one case (Fig. 8a), the\nspectrum was altered, such that it was dominated by the\npeaks expected from hematite, with only weak magnetite\npeaks remaining. In the other case (Fig. 8b), the\nspectrum was still dominated by the peaks associated\nwith magnetite. Based on ratios of anti-Stokes and\nStokes lines in the Raman spectra, we associate a\ntemperature of 216 \u00b1 20 \u0003C with the sample in Fig. 8a\nand 206 \u00b1 20 \u0003C with that in Fig. 8b. We hypothesize\nthat the conditions under which the samples were\nanalyzed may have varied slightly, resulting in the\nslightly different temperatures in each sample (albeit\nwithin our measurement uncertainty) and that the\ntransformation process may be very sensitive to\ntemperature at around 200 \u0003C. This wide variation in\noutcomes suggests that the results of long duration\nRaman analysis with high laser power on small grains\nin aerogel need to be interpreted with caution.\nThe presence of peaks associated with magnetite\nis indicative of the presence of that mineral in the\noriginal sample, but the strength of the peaks does not\nnecessarily indicate the abundance of magnetite that\nwas originally present. Any hematite peaks from a long\nduration analysis could be interpreted as due to heating\nand partial alteration during the Raman analysis, rather\nthan necessarily being indicative of the presence of\nhematite pre-analysis.\nTrack Slice C2044,0,41,0,0\nThe slice of Stardust track C2044,0,41,0,0 was\nexamined optically and around the wall of the cavity\nseveral grains in the size range 5\u201310 lm were identified.\nMost gave no Raman signal (with laser power attenuated\nby the 8% filter to avoid any risk of damaging the\nsample), but one (shown arrowed in Figs. 2 and 11) did.\nTo obtain a better signal to noise ratio in the spectra, this\nsample was illuminated at full laser power (10 mW) for\n15 h. During this run, a full Stokes and anti-Stokes\nspectrum was obtained and the sample temperature\nduring analysis was estimated as 209 \u00b1 20 \u0003C. The\nresulting Raman spectrum is shown in Fig. 9 with peak\npositions and widths given in Table 3. The spectrum is\nvery similar to that from the hematite grains that did not\nundergo long duration analysis. The low wave shift\nnumber peaks are present, although the peak in the\nstandard raw grains at just above 1300 \u2044 cm is not totally\ndistinct above the background. We can also see that the\nstructure at just above 600 \u2044 cm contains two peaks; one at\n\u0002610 \u2044 cm is compatible with the hematite standard\nspectra, but the other at \u0002630 \u2044 cm is similar to that found\nin magnetite. The lack of a peak above 1300 \u2044 cm is not\nexplained\u2014as it is expected if hematite is present\u2014but\napart from this discrepancy, the best explanation of the\nspectrum is a combination of hematite and magnetite\nFig. 8. Raman spectra from magnetite grains fired into aerogel\nat 6 km s)1. The laser illumination was at full power for 20 h.\nTwo grains were used. Before these long runs, the grains,\nwhen illuminated for short periods at lower laser intensity,\ngave magnetite spectra similar to that in Fig. 5. After the 20 h\nillumination, grain (a) is now mostly showing the spectrum\nassociated with hematite, with weak magnetite peaks, whereas\nthe spectrum for grain (b) is still dominated by the peaks from\nthe original magnetite spectrum.\nIron oxides in comet 81P \u2044Wild 2 63\n(with the qualifications given above about the possible\nconsequences of heat processing of magnetite grains in\naerogel as a result of long laser illumination at high\npowers). This is discussed further below.\nTerminal Samples C2005,2,121,2,0 and\nC2005,2,121,1,0\nRaman spectra were taken from one of the terminal\ngrains in track 121 (C2005, 2, 121, 2, 0) and an example\nis shown in Fig. 10 (peak positions and widths are given\nin Table 3). Laser power was 8\u201344% of the total (0.8\u2013\n4.4 mW), with illumination for 8 min in total on any\none grain. At wave numbers up to just above 600 \u2044 cm,\nthe peaks typical of hematite were all visible. However,\nabove this, the two peaks indicative of magnetite were\nalso visible in the same spectrum. The peak at 663 \u2044 cm is\nclearly distinct from the hematite standard peak at\n612 \u2044 cm but agrees well with that for magnetite. Also, the\npeak at 1324 \u2044 cm has a peak position that is too high a\npeak position and is too broad to be associated with that\nin the standard hematite spectrum, but matches better\nwith the magnetite standard. The best interpretation of\nthe spectra is thus again a mixture of hematite and\nmagnetite. The laser-induced heating effects in these\nsamples were small; it was difficult to identify the\nanti-Stokes lines above the background noise level and\nwe thus find that the sample temperatures during the\nRaman analysis were \u00a387 \u0003C.\nSample C2005,2,121,1,0 analyzed at the OU Raman\ngave no Raman signature of mineral structures.

Chromite has previously been identified in\nWild 2 material e.g., in Al foil crater residues (Bridges\net al. 2007). The detectable presence of V and relatively\nhigh Ti contents in the chromite are significant because\nthis is characteristic of extraterrestrial (chondritic)\nchromite rather than terrestrial chromite (Alwmark and\nFig. 9.

If this\nspace weathered material is present, mixed in below the\ncomet\u2019s surface and was carried by the jets from inside\nthe comet into the coma then some of the nm-sized\nFe-bearing particles e.g., in 121,1,0 might have originated\nas space weathered material on comet Wild 2. However,\nthe O-bearing nature of the Fe-rich phases studied here\nrequires that if space-weathered material was present it\nhas undergone subsequent oxidation. The Fe-Ti and\nFe-V-Mn-Ti-Cr oxide cannot have been derived through\nspace weathering and instead we consider they are part of\nthe original cometary mineral assemblage.\nCapture Heating\nDuring capture at 6.1 km s)1, the cometary grains\nexperienced substantial heating. After the first\ndemonstration of capture of mineral grains at high speed\nin aerogel (Tsou et al. 1988), several studies of the effect\nof capture on mineral grains, quickly followed, including\nmelting at grain surfaces (e.g., Bunch et al. 1991; Barrett\net al. 1992) and these are summarized in Burchell et al.\n(2006a,b). More recent studies include Noguchi et al.\n(2007), Ho\u00a8rz et al. (2008), and Burchell et al. (2008). It is\nclear from the abundant melted, rounded Fe sulfide and\nmetal grains found along the tracks that melting and\nsulfur remobilization has occurred in general. This can be\nseen for example, in the work of Leroux et al. 2008, who,\nas here, examined grains from track 41, along with grains\nfrom track 35 (a Type B, bulbous track), and track 44 (a\nlarge feature where the incident particle hit both aerogel\nand the container wall) and some grains of unknown\ntrack type. Recrystallized sulfide-metal assemblages\nfrequently occur as metal (kamacite) cores and sulfide\n(pyrrhotite) rims in grains that range in size from nm to\n<100 nm diameter. Taenite also occurs. Temperatures\nassociated with capture of the cometary grains and\nmetal-sulfide recrystallization must have exceeded that of\nthe Fe-Ni-S eutectic. This eutectic temperature increases\nwith pressure and is at least 950\u20131000 \u0003C and gives a\nminimum temperature during capture.\nThere have been conflicting arguments for whether\ncapture heating in aerogel causes oxidation or reduction.\nRietmeijer et al. (2008) described Fe silicides near the\nentrance of track 44: they suggested these resulted from\nthe reduction of melted Fe-Ni sulfide grains. Marcus\net al. (2008) also reported light-gas gun experiments\nwhere ferric iron had been reduced to ferrous compounds\nand considered that this was associated with capture\nheating in the presence of carbon within the aerogel. In\ncontrast, Grossemy et al. (2008) used Fe-XANES to\nshow that ferric iron-rich particles identified near the\ntrack mouth of Allende meteorite particle tracks in\naerogel (shot with a light-gas gun) were the result of the\noxidation of olivine. Our Fe-XANES spectra of FeNi\nmetal suggests that some oxidation has occurred during\ncapture heating within 1 mm of the track 41 entrance, in\nagreement with the conclusions of Grossemy et al.\nHowever, the relatively high abundance of magnetite\nwithin the Allende meteorite means that some of the\nmagnetite in the Grossemy et al. experiments (and thus\nby analogy within our samples) might have been derived\nfrom the meteorite (or in our case comet Wild 2) rather\nthan being due to capture-related oxidation of other\nminerals. Oxidation of FeNi metal after the samples were\nreturned to Earth through interaction with the\natmosphere is also a possibility which cannot be ruled\nout as contributing to the limited oxidation identified in\nour Fe-XANES analyses of the Fe-Ni grains.\nHeating During Analysis\nThe Fe-XANES and Raman spectra obtained from\ngrains in tracks 41 and 121 show evidence for mixtures\nof hematite and magnetite at scales <3\u20135 lm spot size\nof the illumination laser in the Raman spectrometer and\nthe synchrotron spot size. As discussed above, tests on\nIron oxides in comet 81P \u2044Wild 2 67\nthe laboratory analogs showed that both hematite and\nmagnetite remained distinct after capture in aerogel at\nspeeds of \u00026 km s)1, but that prolonged exposure to\nstrong laser illumination of magnetite grains in aerogel\ncould produce hematite. This may have been relevant to\njust one of the grains which underwent a long duration\nanalysis (Figs. 2 and 11) in the track 41 sample, but not\nto the extracted terminal grains from track 121\u2014both\nthe magnetite-hematite mixtures and amorphous Fe\noxide. We therefore suggest that, in most cases,\nthe micron-scale hematite and magnetite grains are\nprimordial cometary grains and are not artifacts of\ncapture or analysis. We particularly also note that our\nXRS and Fe-XANES analyses identified magnetite-\nhematite in spots that had not been analyzed at all by\nmicroRaman, so we do not believe that the Raman\nanalyses caused the formation of the observed Fe oxides.\nOrigin of the Fe Oxides\nAlthough we consider the Fe-Cr-V-Ti to be\nunambiguously cometary in origin, the Fe oxide\npotentially has a more complex origin. Zn-bearing\ngrains such as one identified in track 41 are a sign that\nthere is some contamination from the manufacture of\nthe aerogel (M. E. Zolensky, personal communication).\nAs described above, we do not think that the Raman\nanalyses formed the magnetite or amorphous Fe oxide,\nbut it is possible that some of the hematite which\npartially replaces magnetite in a large grain in track 41\n(Fig. 2) may be an analytical artifact. The Fe-XANES\nanalyses suggest that capture heating in the aerogel has\npartially oxidized the outer parts of the FeNi metal\ngrains. The intermixing of grains like Fe-Cr-V-Ti-Mn\nand Fe-Ti oxide around the track 41 slice with\nmagnetite-hematite is consistent with the original\ncometary Fe-bearing oxides probably having been\nlargely preserved. However, we do not yet have firm\nproof for the cometary origin of the hematite-magnetite\nand further studies are required to check this.\nThe amorphous Fe oxide in sample 121,1,0 from\ntrack 121 could have originated through slight\noxidation during capture of metallic iron. The origin\nof this amorphous phase is uncertain and there is no\nfirm evidence that it is not a terrestrial contaminant\nfrom aerogel manufacture, like the Zn-Fe compound in\ntrack 41. However, the 121,2,0 sample, also from track\n121 does have a crystalline magnetite-hematite\nstructure. Thus, the Fe oxides in tracks 41 and 121\nhave a variety of origins mainly related to the comet\nWild 2 parent body and capture heating-oxidation with\nrelatively minor effects from microRaman analyses\nand possible terrestrial contamination of amorphous\nFe-oxide.\nComparisons to Chondrites and IDPs\nIron oxide is found in IDPs (Rietmeijer 1998)\nintergrownwith phyllosilicates and is interpreted as having\nresulted from low temperature hydrothermal alteration on\na cometary CI-like parent body (Keller et al. 1992) or\nother carbonaceous chondrite parent body. Rietmeijer\n(1998) and Bradley et al. (1996) suggested that some\nmagnetite found as overgrowths on silicate and sulfide\nminerals was the result of the heating and oxidation of\nsilicates during atmospheric entry. Bradley (1994a)\nreported an Fe-Ni grain with a magnetite rim in an IDP.\nThis was interpreted as having resulted from energetic\nparticle bombardment during its passage in space.\nHowever, subsequent descriptions of space weathering\neffects have shown that this process is more likely\nassociated with reduction e.g., Noble et al. (2007).\nZolensky and Lindstrom (1992) described magnetite in 12\nchondritic IDPs. They suggested that magnetite around\nthe outer margins of IDPs was formed by oxidation of the\nIDPs during atmospheric entry, but that magnetite within\nthe centers of IDPs was primary.\nMagnetite is present in CI, CV, oxidized CO, CM,\nand CR chondrites. Keller et al. (1992) and Brearley\nand Jones (1998) made the comparison between IDPs\nand CI chondrites because magnetite is one of the\ncommon signs of asteroidal alteration in this type of\nchondrite. Magnetite is the second most abundant\nphase in CI chondrites and has been described by\nMadsen et al. (1986), Morlok et al. (2006), Choi and\nWasson (2003), and earlier work summarized in\nBrearley and Jones (1998). It occurs in a range of\ntextures, but most commonly as 10\u201330 lm size\nsubspherical aggregates. Fe2O3 as maghemite or hematite\ncan also be present, although this could in turn be the\nproduct of magnetite oxidation (Haggerty and Baker\n1967). CI magnetite is intergrown with phyllosilicates,\nparticularly serpentine. If the magnetite now present in\nour comet Wild 2 samples originated through such\nalteration, it might be expected to be associated with\nphyllosilicates such as serpentine minerals. The lack of\nphyllosilicates might be due to dehydration and\nrecrystallization during capture, although it remains an\nanomalous absence in the Wild 2 analyses to date. The\ncomposition of magnetite in CIs\u2014like that identified in\nour C2005,2,121,1,0 sample\u2014is essentially pure Fe3O4\n(Brearley and Jones 1998).\nThe asteroidal alteration in chondrites is believed\nto have occurred between 2 and 15 Myr after the\nformation of CAIs, but there does not appear to be any\nnarrow set of oxygen fugacities or fluid composition\nassociated with it (Zolensky et al. 2008). Morlok et al.\n(2006) concluded that low temperature alteration,\nincluding magnetite, in CIs formed in a closed system,\n68 J. C. Bridges et al.\nwhere mineralogical differences in the lithologies\nreflected heterogeneities in the starting material.\nAlthough asteroidal alteration is one possible origin for\nmagnetite in chondrite meteorites and IDPs the origin\nfor the Wild 2 grains remains unclear.\nFlynn (2008) used the result of 20 synchrotron\nanalyses of tracks and fragments of tracks to suggest\nthat the more volatile element abundances, e.g., Zn, Cu,\nshowed an affinity to anhydrous porous IDPs but the\nmore refractory elements, e.g., Ca to Fe, were closer to\nCI abundances. Thus, the Flynn analyses suggest there\nmay be no easy, exclusive correlation between comet\nWild 2 and either IDPs or CI chondrites. However,\nIshii et al. (2008) noted that amorphous silicates with\nembedded metal and sulfide (known as GEMS) were a\nmajor constituent of anhydrous porous IDPs, but that\nthe initial reports of these in comet Wild 2 samples were\ncompatible with impact capture processing of the\naerogel, rather than cometary GEMS of which there are\ncurrently no firm identifications in Wild 2. Furthermore,\nthey noted that refractory minerals, CAIs, chondrules,\nand chondrule fragments are normally absent from, or\nexceedingly rare, in chondritic porous IDPs, but are\nfound in almost all chondritic meteorites. Thus, Ishii\net al. suggested that comet Wild 2 was most similar to\nchondritic material originating within the inner solar\nsystem.\nOur results show an unequilibrated mixture of\nreduced (e.g., FeNi metal) and oxidized phases in close\nproximity within the tracks. These phases can be present\nin both types of planetary material\u2014chondrite and IDP.\nIn IDPs, FeNi metal is often associated with GEMS\n(Bradley 1994a, 1994b) although FeNi metal has also\nbeen identified in some asteroidal IDPs (Rietmeijer\n2004). As discussed above, it has been suggested that\nGEMS are absent \u2044not yet demonstrated in the Stardust\nsamples. However, melted aerogel and its enclosed,\nrounded Fe-Ni-S grains can appear similar to GEMS,\nmaking identification difficult.\nIf the apparent absence of GEMS is genuine, then\nthe Stardust samples including the Fe oxide ones studied\nhere are most consistent with comet Wild 2 material\nbeing of a chondritic rather than IDP nature. However,\nmore data are required from the Stardust samples before\nthe origins of the different minerals including Fe oxides\nand the IDP versus chondritic analogies become clear.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have conducted a suite of materials\ncharacterization analyses by Fe-XANES, TEM, and\nmicroRaman on cometary dust grains captured by the\nNASA Stardust space mission soon after ejection from\ncomet 81P \u2044Wild 2. This has been backed up by studies of\nanalog samples created in light-gas gun experiments. We\nfind:\n1. We have identified iron oxides in a slice taken\n0.8 mm along track 41 and some terminal samples\nfrom track 121. V-rich chromite (Fe-Cr-V-Ti-Mn\noxide), Fe-Ti oxide (ilmenite?), and partially\noxidized FeNi metal are present in track 41. The\nterminal samples from track 121 also contain traces\nof sulfide and Mg-rich silicate.\n2. Fe oxide grains are either a magnetite-hematite\nmixture or have no structure detected by electron\ndiffraction.\n3. Fe-XANES shows that capture heating in the\naerogel has led to partial oxidation of some phases,\nnotably the FeNi metal. This does not appear to\nhave had a significant effect on the magnetite-\nhematite. Our light-gas gun experiments on\nlaboratory analog samples of Wild 2 mineral\nanalogs at 6 km s)1 suggest that the temperatures\nreached during Raman analysis of many hours\nduration might have been sufficient to cause some\nalteration of the magnetite to hematite. However,\napart potentially from one large grain, which we\nanalyzed for a long time, we do not think our\nmicroRaman analyses changed the mineralogy of\nthe Fe oxides.\n4. Amorphous Fe oxide might either be a product of\nthe capture-related or terrestrial atmospheric\noxidation of metallic iron. Terrestrial contamination\nwithin the aerogel is also possible.\n5. The oxides co-exist with reduced, metallic phases\n(partially oxidized due to capture or terrestrial\nalteration). This provides further evidence that this\ncomet consists of a diverse mixture of unequilibrated\nmineral assemblages. Further work is required to\nassess the similarities with IDP or chondrite samples\nand to calculate accurate abundances.\n6. Finally, we recommend that, when reporting analyses\nof Stardust samples, authors need to specify the track\nand sample catalog numbers, and also state the track\ntype (A, B, etc.) and where along the track the sample\ngrain(s) were located (wall of cavity, terminal grain,\netc.). This is necessary to help build up a more\nconsistent picture of the degree of (heat) processing\nand mixing with aerogel that has occurred during the\ncapture event and the relation of the analyzed grains\nto the original cometary dust particle.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We thank the NASA Curatorial\nFacility for supplying the Stardust samples used in this\nwork and preparing the terminal particles from track\n121.
