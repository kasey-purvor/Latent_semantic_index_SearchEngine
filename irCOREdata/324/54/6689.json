With a folder of lecture notes, multiple-choice assessment and an optical\nmark reader, it is equally easy for the academic to process 10 or 100 or 500 students.\nIndeed, the example of many American universities suggests that class size need be limited\nonly by the capacity of the auditorium.\nThe endurance of the lecture course is no accident. Computer-based learning (CBL)\ntechnology can claim to introduce 'added value' to the student experience as an adjunct to\nan existing lecture course, or to be well suited to students with special needs, such as\ndistance learners, but the acceptance of CBL by those at the sharp end of teaching will be\nslow unless CBL can contribute to increased staff efficiency.\nThe traditional lecture course does, however, have an Achilles' heel: it fosters in students\nfew of the Personal Transferable Skills (PTSs) that are now widely recommended to\n64\nALT-J Volume 6 Number i\nuniversities, e.g. teamwork, independent judgement, organizational skills (Dearing, 1997).\nMoreover, traditional lecture delivery can sometimes favour certain kinds of learning\n(comprehension, information recall) over others (synthesis, evaluation). Consequently,\nthere is room to make improvements in educational efficiency if the cost in staff efficiency\nis not prohibitive. Below, I will describe my experience in replacing a traditional lecture\nformat with one where independent student teams undertake resource-based learning\n(RBL), which means that the course content was delivered through media other than the\nlecturer. The idea behind RBL is not new (Noble, 1980; Clarke, 1982; Exley and Gibbs,\n1994), but I will argue that it makes a natural antecedent of CBL because there is an\nobvious role for the computers to play: that of delivering the learning resources. Most\nimportantly, the RBL format can actually increase staff efficiency by encouraging students\nto teach each other.\nOverview\nBio. 1001, Biological Investigations, is a mandatory course for first-year undergraduates in\nthe Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Exeter. The course caters for\naround 120 students and is supported by six postgraduate demonstrators (15 hours each)\nand one lecturer (35 contact hours). The IT facility is available in business hours only, and\noffers 12 PCs with typical core software. In previous incarnations, the course took the\ntraditional lecture\/practical format with two lectures per week over 10 weeks and five\npractical sessions of three hours each. The lectures were generally unsuccessful because of\nthe heterogeneity in student backgrounds. Experienced students appeared to be bored by\nremedial teaching, and inexperienced students baffled by anything too advanced.\nAccommodating all students in a single practical session was also unsatisfactory because of\nthe requirement that students share a computer terminal, which did not encourage\neveryone to obtain hands-on experience, and some students became marginalized and\nunmotivated. The revised course retained its 10-week timetable position and credit value,\nbut involved a redirection of the content away from pure statistical analysis, and a radical\nchange in course format. The aim of the revised course was for students to be able to\nconduct a scientific experiment, to analyse the results, and to write a report on their\nexperiment as a 'publication-quality' scientific paper. In this process, the students should\nacquire competence in the appropriate computer-based professional tools: spreadsheet,\nstatistical package and word processor.\nLearning environment\nThe key to the new course is in its organization. Approximately 120 students are grouped\ninto 18 teams of 6 or 7, which are formed from the pastoral tutorial groups that the\nstudents join when they arrive in the department. Each team is assigned a postgraduate\ndemonstrator to act as a mentor. The mentor will advise and assess the team. Each demon-\nstrator acts as mentor to three teams. The cohesion of the course is maintained by email.\nStudents can contact each other, their mentor or the lecturer, although all transactions be-\ntween teams and the staff are mediated initially by mentors. Thus, mentors act as a filter\nbetween the students and the lecturer, to whom mentors report any problems either by\nemail, or at a weekly meeting convened by the lecturer.\nThere are several advantages to deploying students in teams:\n65\nJames \u00a3 Gesswell Team-centred, resource-based learning as the antecedent of computer-based learning\n\u2022 Resources can be distributed to teams instead of to individuals, which means that the\nresource budget is divided into 18 rather than 120 units. Consequently, a higher quality\nof documentation can be afforded.\n\u2022 Students are encouraged to develop team-related PTSs.\n\u2022 The heterogeneity in student backgrounds can be put to work when the experienced\nstudents help the inexperienced students in their team.\nAn important ingredient is that the students are assessed as a team for a major portion of\nthe course marks. Therefore, individuals should be concerned for their team's performance,\nand this could motivate them to share their skills.\nCourse work and its assessment\nThe teams are set a series of 10 tasks, which involve either practice on software or,\neventually, analysis of their own experimental results and the preparation of the scientific\npaper. The tasks are designed to build skills cumulatively towards the production of the\nscientific paper. Therefore, students learn email first, then progress through exercises that\nuse the spreadsheet, the statistics package and, finally, the word processor. Each task is\ncompleted by each individual, but students can double their marks if the entire group\ncompletes the task by the deadline (typically the end of the week on which the task was\nissued). In this way, students are encouraged to help other group members. Often, the\ncompletion of a task will involve sending output from an application (for example, the\nspreadsheet) to the mentor by email. By email, the student receives prompt acknowledge-\nment and, when necessary, advice on how to repeat the task satisfactorily.\nSome of the tasks involve a group assessment, which proceeds as follows:\nThe entire group convenes at a time agreed with the mentor. Only if the entire group is\npresent does the mentor then 'randomly' select two or three students for assessment, in\nwhich they are observed in performing some simple computer-based tasks. Again, all\nstudents must perform satisfactorily for the group to pass the assessment. The observa-\ntional assessments help to ensure that all students have acquired competence, and reduce\nthe possibility that some students are completing tasks for others. A final component of\nthe assessment is the submission of the scientific paper itself, which is co-authored by each\nteam except for the discussion section. Each student writes and submits his or her own\ndiscussion, something which allows space for individuality. Thus, each student receives a\nmixture of team marks and individual marks for the scientific paper.\nResources available to students\nIn addition to providing a brief, the task sheets contain an appendix with hints and\nreferences to the course pack. In this instance, the course pack forms the heart of the RBL\napproach. Each learning group receives a course pack, which contains rules and resources.\nRules specify the protocol for the assessments and the usage of resources (for example, a\nprocess for booking computer time, or access to mentors), and the rules for taking a group\nassessment. Resources in the course pack include various instructions for computer\napplications, exercises in the use of statistical tests, and guidance in conducting\nexperiments and writing reports. Course pack documentation included material on\n66\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nsoftware usage from IT Services at Exeter and also copies of various Student's Guides\n(from Software Made Simple, Leicester).\nStudents are also encouraged to attend a weekly organizational meeting at the lecture\ntheatre, where there are facilities for displaying computer output to the audience. Here, they\ncan watch a demonstration of the steps required to complete each task and they have a\nchance to ask questions in person. The most important resource is the student's own team,\nwhich acts as a learning group. In their team, students can pass on their own previous\nexperience or collaborate in solving course-related problems. Students can also question\ntheir mentor by email, or book an advisory meeting, although the teams are made aware of\ntime limits (not more than 30 minutes mentor time per team per week). If necessary,\nstudents can contact the lecturer by email with the offer of an appointment if necessary.\nStudent performance in 1997\nOverall, the students' performance was very good, the mean mark for the course being 66\nper cent, which was much higher than in preceding years. Three quarters of students\ncompleted all 10 tasks and 96 per cent completed at least seven. The continuous assessment\nallowed early identification of wayward students, and their tutor was immediately notified.\nThis procedure proved highly effective in re-directing under-performing students. Without\nexception, the few team conflicts were resolved amicably by the rapid intervention of the\npastoral tutor or lecturer (students were very quick to alert their mentor to difficulties that\nlost them points, which usually resulted from an inability to convene the entire group for\nobservational assessments).\nThe students' perception of their own competence in scientific skills (experimental design,\nstatistics, reports) was improved significantly by their experience of the course (Table 1),\nwhich is an important result because these are areas that, for undergraduates, are often\nsurrounded by anxiety. With respect to IT skills, the students' own perception of their\nabilities rose greatly across the course and, by the end, they showed widespread confidence\n(Table 1). It is reasonable to assert that the course had provided satisfactory IT training for\nthe entire cohort (with the exception of WWW-related activities).\nSkill area\nWindows\nEmail\nWord processor\nComputers\nSpreadsheets\nExperimental design\nStatistics\nReports\nFile transfer\nStatistical package\nBefore\n1.5\nI.I\nI.I\n1.0\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.2\n0.1\nAfter\n.9\n.9\n.8\n.5\n.5\n.1\n.0\n.1\n.4\n.0\nTable I: Results ofself-assessment questionnaires completed by 62 students before and after\nparticipating in Bio. 1001.

CressweU Team-centred, resource-based learning as the antecedent of computer-based learning\nStaff efficiency and performance\nAs lecturer, it took me about two weeks to design the course by conversion from the\nprevious lecture format and to prepare the course materials. During the course, I met with\nstudents (one hour per week) and postgraduate mentors (also one hour per week). In\naddition, I spent some time in answering email, dealing directly with some groups and in\nnotifying tutors of under-performing students. Overall, I expect the new format to reduce\nmy time input for the entire course from 35 contact hours to 25-30 hours. The post-\ngraduate demonstrators were satisfied with the requirements made of them, and mostly\npreferred to work via email at their own convenience rather than having to attend a\npractical session for an entire afternoon. From my point of view, the performance of\ndemonstrators was much more equitable, being less dictated by their inclination\/ability to\ndeal directly with students in a laboratory setting.\nPossibilities for the development of CBL in Bio. 1001\nThe course is now at a stage where further support could be provided for the teams in\ntackling the tasks set for them. Computers provide a natural medium for delivering the\nsupporting resources. For example, the STEPS consortium offers a variety of learning\nmaterials for the computer that relate to statistics and that are set in a biological context\n(Mogey, 1996, 23). Additionally, some form of computer-mediated self-assessment would\noffer opportunities for students to put their learning into practice.\nConclusions\nTeam-centred RBL appears to be an effective avenue for changing from lecture-centred\ndelivery. In addition to improving staff efficiency, it also fosters a wide range of PTSs in the\nstudents. Moreover, the direct involvement of RBL provides a role for computers that are a\nnatural choice for the delivery of the required resources to independent learners.\nIt is possible to argue that the format of Bio. 1001 will not generalize because many of the\ntasks are, in themselves, computer-based, and because the assessment of the tasks is\npass\/fail. However, these objections do not relate to the fundamental requirements for the\nadoption of the format, which is actually contingent on the ability to set teams to work on\na series of tasks with adequate supporting resources. Therefore, it may be possible to\nintroduce serial, group tasks into any continuously assessed course in which the intended\nlearning outcomes can be accurately and explicitly identified and then logically ordered. I\nthus contend that the potential advantages of team-centred RBL are sufficient to make its\nconsideration worthwhile.\nReferences\nClarke, J.
