NRs sense lipophilic ligands, with\neither broad affinity, e.g., fatty acids are sensed by peroxisome\nproliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), or with high affinity.\nThe latter ligands include (i) steroid hormones, e.g., estradiol\n(sensed by estrogen receptor (ER)-a and -b), progesterone\n(progesterone receptor), testosterone (androgen receptor\n(AR)), cortisol (glucocorticoid receptor (GR)) and aldosterol\n(mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)), (ii) thyroid hormone\n(thyroid hormone receptor-a and -b), (iii) retinoic acid (retinoic\nacid receptor-a, -b and -g) and (iv) the seco-steroid 1a,25-\ndihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D receptor (VDR)) (Carlberg\nand Dunlop, 2006; Ebert et al, 2006; Cutress et al, 2008).\nWhereas most other cellular receptors are located in the\nplasma membrane, NRs derive their family name from the\nearly and paradoxical observation that they are generally\nlocated in the nucleus, despite responding to extracellular\nsignals (Fanestil and Edelman, 1966). Hydrophobic, extra-\ncellular signal molecules serving as NR ligands are classically\nenvisioned to diffuse through the plasma membrane, the\ncytosol and gain entry to the nucleus (Gardner, 1975). There\nthey are able to bind to the corresponding NRs, which are\nalready bound to their specific DNA binding site, referred to as\nresponse element (RE).We shall refer to this mechanism as the\n\u2018classical\u2019 design of nuclear receptor signaling.\nMany studies have since suggested that this is much too\nsimple a picture (reviewed in Cutress et al, 2008; Cao et al,\n2009; Levin, 2009a; Bunce and Campbell, 2010). Ligand\ndistribution appears dynamic with some NRs found predomi-\nnantly in the nucleus (e.g., PXR and PPAR), whereas others are\nlocated either in both compartments (e.g., VDR and MR) or\nMolecular Systems Biology 6; Article number 446; doi:10.1038\/msb.2010.102\nCitation: Molecular Systems Biology 6:446\n& 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 1744-4292\/10\nwww.molecularsystemsbiology.com\n& 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited Molecular Systems Biology 2010 1\nmostly in the cytoplasm (e.g., GR and AR). NRs may\nalso reside in cellular organelles and associate with\nmembranes (Levin, 2009b). Moreover, if a given NR is\npredominantly located in the nucleus, it is not exclusively\nso and may be relocated outside the nucleus. Recent\nstudies show that \u2018nuclear\u2019 NRs, such as PPARs, are shuttled\nactively between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Von Knethen\net al, 2010). Ligand addition changes receptor location\ndynamically. For example, the addition of ligand causes a\ncomplete shift of GR and AR from the cytoplasm to the\nnucleus (Pratt et al, 1989; Liu and DeFranco, 2000; Kumar\net al, 2004, 2006; Tanaka et al, 2005; Heitzer et al, 2007; Pru\u00a8fer\nand Boudreaux, 2007; Ricketson et al, 2007; Cutress et al,\n2008).\nWe have considered a number of key questions of NR\nfunction. Is it functionally important for the NR also to be\nlocated outside the nucleus? Or is it sufficient for a ligand to\ndiffuse into the nucleus? Subsequent to this question we also\nconsidered whether the extranuclear NR location is an\ninadvertent escape, or leakage, of receptor through the\nnuclear membrane and detracts from the functionality of the\nnuclear component? Alternatively, dynamically controlled\nshuttling out of the nucleus may be functional and represent\nan aspect of complexity that is evolutionarily advantageous?\nFinally, do all NRs function in actually the same way with\nminor variations, or do genuinely distinct mechanisms of\nsignaling exist?\nIn order to address these issues, we have first asked\nhow complex NR signaling necessarily is by determining a\ncommon denominator of the topology of these signaling\nnetworks. This reveals a number of additional complexities,\nas well as properties that at first sight would seem to make\nthese networks ineffective. We subsequently calculate\nhow resolutions of these paradoxes may correspond to\nnewly recognized network design principles that enhance\nfunctionalities.\nResults\nCanonical network topology of endocrine\nNR signaling\nUsing the SBML-compliant graphical network notation\n(SBGN) (Kitano et al, 2005), we constructed a \u2018canonical\u2019\nendocrine NR signaling network that is rooted in the present\nliterature (Figure 1). The network accounts for NR activation,\nimportin-a and -b binding, nuclear pore complex (NPC)-\nmediated import, recycling of importins, NR binding to target\npromoter sequences, exportin-mediated nuclear export of the\nNR, exportin cycling and free energy-driven Ran recycling.\nWhen bound to its ligand, the NR induces transactivation and\ntransrepression of its cognate REs. This topology is ostensibly\nmore complex than that of a hydrophobic signal molecule\nmerely crossing the plasma membrane, moving to the nucleus\nand binding and activating the NR complexed with its RE. To\naddress to what extent this extra complexity is functional, we\nundertook the following analysis to reveal that the simplest\ndesign does not accurately recapitulate experimentally ob-\nserved function, and indeed most aspects of this topological\ncomplexity serve sophisticated biological function.\nIn principle, all reactions depicted in Figure 1 could run in\nthe opposite, and functionally counterproductive, direction.\nTherefore, we have considered the underlying thermo-\ndynamics. NR-shuttling processes are driven by the Gibbs\nfree energy stored in the non-equilibrium ratio of (GTP)\/\n((GDP) \u0002 (phosphate)). This ratio is probably the same in the\ncytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, because of diffusivity\nof GTP, GDP, phosphate and Mg2\u00fe . The unequal distribution\nof Ran-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and Ran-guanine\nnucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activities across the nuclear\nmembrane may sustain higher concentrations of RanGTP (or\nrather: a higher ratio of RanGTP\/RanGDP) in the nucleus than\nin the cytoplasm. This ratio consequently establishes an\nexportin and importin gradient that, in turn, drives the nucleo\u2013\nFigure 1 (A,B) Network diagram for GR signaling. The NR signaling network is shown in terms of seven modules, in standard SBGN (Kitano et al, 2005). (A) (i) Ligand\nbinding to NR not yet bound to DNA. Core-NR (indicated by the blue wedge shape) has its NLS1 masked by Hsp90, while its NLS2 is accessible. Both its NES1 and its\nNES2 are exposed. In this state the affinity of NR for DNA is low. Upon binding its ligand, the conformation of the NR is changed, the NR dimerizes, the NLS1 becomes\nunmasked, the NES2 is masked and the affinity of the NR to DNA is thereby increased. The consequent binding to the DNA (and the engagement of NR in active import\ninto the nucleus, see below) shifts NR from cytoplasm to nucleus when ligand is added (Drouin et al, 1992). (ii) Reversible NR binding to REs: both liganded and core-\nNRs bind to REs and form tetramers. The DNA binding affinity for NRL is higher than that for core-NR (Garlatti et al, 1994). (iii) NR nuclear import: Both core and NRL\nbind to importin-a. Core-NR binds to importin-a due to the NLS2, but the NLS1 is occluded by Hsp90 protein. If the NR is liganded, both its NLS1 and its NLS2 are\navailable. This provides higher affinity to importin-a (Pemberton and Paschal, 2005). Binding of the NR alters the conformation of importin-a such that its N terminus\nbecomes accessible to importin-b, which, in turn, can interact with the nucleoporins in the NPC. The NPC allows the importins\u2013cargo complex to pass the nuclear\nenvelope (Sharova, 2002; Tran and Wente, 2006) The importin-b\u2013importin-a\u2013cargo complex binds RanGTP, which is exclusive to the nuclear compartment. Importin-b\u2013\nimportin-a\u2013cargo\u2013RanGTP complex dissociates into an importin-a\u2013cargo and an importin-b\u2013RanGTP moiety. Importin-a\u2013cargo complex associates with RanGTP and\nCAS, which allows the cargo NR plus hormone to dissociate from the complex. RanGTP favors dissociation of the complexes and hence pushes the balance to\ndissociation of the cargo complexes in the nucleus, where association may be favored in the absence of RanGTP (i.e., in the cytosol). (iv) NR nuclear export: NR binds to\nexportin1 (CRM1) via NES1 or to calrecetin (CRT) via NES2. Both exportins bind to RanGTP and the resulting cargo\u2013exportins\u2013RanGTP complex passes through the\nNPC to the cytoplasm, where free RanGTP is hydrolyzed to RanGDP by RanGAP with the assistance of RanBP1. The lower level of RanGTP in the cytosol, as compared\nwith the nucleus, favors dissociation of the complex into cargo, exportins and RanGTP. (B) (v) Active export of importins: both importin-a\u2013RanGTP\u2013Cas and importin-\nb\u2013RanGTP complexes can move between nucleus and cytoplasm via the NPC. GAP associates with the NPC on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear membrane,\nprovoking the hydrolysis of RanGTP to RanGDP in both the complexes (Pemberton and Paschal, 2005), which then dissociate. GTP hydrolysis is assisted by the\nRanBP1 protein and coupled to the dissociation of RanGDP molecules from importins. (vi) Nuclear membrane transport of exportins: Exp1, CRT and Cas diffuse across\nthe nuclear membrane through the NPC (Pemberton and Paschal, 2005). (vii) RanGTP synthesis: RanGDP is returned into the nucleus in a complex with transport factor\nNTF2 (Poon and Jans, 2005). The pool of RanGTP is restored when nuclear GEF (containing RCC1 protein and associated with chromatin (Macara, 2001)) replaces\nGDP with GTP in the Ran molecule (Pemberton and Paschal, 2005). The function of GEF is to provide a 4-step reversible reaction: RCC1 binds RanGDP, GDP is\nreleased from the complex, GTP binds to Ran-RCC1 and finally RCC1 splits from Ran-GTP (Riddick and Macara, 2007).\nDesign principles of nuclear receptor signaling\nAN Kolodkin et al\n2 Molecular Systems Biology 2010 & 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited\nAB\nNucleus\nNuclear membrane\ntransport\nof exportins\nRanGTP synthesis\nCytoplasm\nCytoplasm\nLigand binding to NR not\nyet bound to DNA\nActive export of importins\nNR nuclear import Nucleus NR binding to promoter regions (RE)\nDesign principles of nuclear receptor signaling\nAN Kolodkin et al\n& 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited Molecular Systems Biology 2010 3\ncytoplasmic distribution of cargo away from thermodynamic\nequilibrium. None of these three free-energy transduction\nprocesses will take place at 100% efficiency, as they all occur\nout of thermodynamic equilibrium (Westerhoff, 1985). This\nnon-equilibrium pumping system causes importins and\nexportins to shuttle actively and repeatedly between cyto-\nplasm and nucleus, to induce NR shuttling, and thus to\nmaintain an NR gradient. Analysis of the detailed network\n(Figure 1) suggests that the effectiveness of nucleo\u2013cytoplas-\nmic shuttling might also depend on a number of additional\nthermokinetic aspects, including (i) affinity competitions of\ntransport and cargo proteins, (ii) the quality and state of the\nNLSs and NESs of the cargo proteins, (iii) the saturation of the\ntransport machinery with other cargo and (iv) the non-\nequilibrium efficiency of the entire process. Consequently,\nunderstanding the impact of nucleo\u2013cytoplasmic shuttling on\nNR signaling is not merely a matter of assessing the quality of\nthe NLSs and NESs of the cargo signaling protein of interest.\nRather, the impact depends on the network as a whole, which\nin turn reflects both the kinetic parameter values of key\nmolecules in the network and network topology. This study\nfocuses on the latter, topological design aspects of the network\nrepresented in Figure 1 and in particular on key aspects that we\nconsider to be non-obvious and at times even paradoxical.\nEndocrine NR signaling: complex and paradoxical\naspects\nFigure 1 contains the \u2018common denominator\u2019 of the NR\nsignaling networks. This common denominator is surprisingly\ncomplex when compared with the classical paradigm of NR\nsignaling. By \u2018classical\u2019 we refer to the concept that a given\nNR resides in the nucleus, attached to a RE waiting for the\nligand to bind (design 1 in Figure 2). Though \u2018classical\u2019 in\nour terminology, this concept is not current anymore: more\ndynamic pictures of this NR signaling abound. Here, however,\nwe shall use this mechanism as the backdrop against which to\ncompare other subsequently proposed mechanisms, including\nthe most current ones. We identify eight aspects of the\ntopology of Figure 1 that are absent from the classical design.\nSome of these are paradoxical in the sense that on first value,\nthey could be taken to impede rather than enhance signaling,\nspecifically:\n(1) Not all NR molecules are associated with the DNA,\npotentially limiting the extent of transcription activation. (2)\nNot all NR molecules reside in the nucleus, which could\nsimilarly limit function. (3) NR can move across the nuclear\nmembrane, further leading to possible escape of NR from the\nproximity of the DNA. (4) Active transport and the corre-\nsponding hydrolysis of GTPwouldwaste free energy that is not\nwasted in the classical design. (5) Why do both an import\nsystem (using importins) and an export system (using\nexportins) exist for NRs? Export systems may lead to\nredundancy? (6) The possible shuttling of NR from nucleus\nto cytosol and back could constitute a \u2018futile cycle\u2019 wasting\neven more free energy. (7) Although importins aid the import\nof NR, it is the export, not the import, of importins that is\ncoupled to GTP hydrolysis. (8) There is a single transport\nsystem in the nuclear membrane for all NRs, suggesting\nfragility due to interferences between different NR and other\nsignaling pathways.\nWe have examined whether or not the classical design by\nitself is satisfactory, that is, it is able to recapitulate biological\ndata and function. Subsequently, we investigated which of the\neight aspects of topology individually contributes most to the\nsystem. We shall now leave the full complexity of Figure 1\nbehind us and focus on aspects of this complexity, one by one.\nThe classical, simple interpretation of endocrine\nNR signaling would not work\nIn the classical, and simplest, mechanism for endocrine NR-\nmediated signaling (design 1 in Figure 2A), the dynamics of\nthe transcriptional response were simulated using realistic\nparameter values. For this and for all other designs, the\naddition of ligand was modeled as the increase of its fixed\nconcentration in the outer cellular membrane from 0 to\n0.005 nM, in which the concentrations are quantified as the\naqueous concentrations both extracellular and in the cytosol\nimmediately adjacent to the plasma membrane; we shall\nassume a rapid equilibration of the ligand between these\naqueous phases and the plasma membrane phase. The\nconcentration of ligand in the nucleus (Ln) was treated as\naqueous only; i.e., in terms of the total number of molecules\ndivided by the volume of the nucleus. When considering a\nrealistic NR ligand-binding constant in the order of 1 nM,\nas, e.g., for binding of the cortisol analog dexamethasone\nto GR (Marissal-Arvy et al, 1999), there was no significant\ntranscriptional response to the exposure of the model to\nthe 0.005 nM of ligand. This is contrary to what might have\nbeen expected for this classical model of NR signaling.\nIndeed, this concentration of ligand led only to an extremely\nlow saturation of the NR with ligand. Only 1 of every 200 NR\nmolecules would have ligand bound and because the number\nof NR proteins is far lower to the number of potential REs, far\no1 out of every 200 REs could be activated. Clearly, this\nmechanism would not suffice for signaling the presence of\nligand at low but realistic concentrations.\nThe advantage of non-DNA-bound NR protein\nWe speculated that having excess activated NR proteins\ncontributing to RE activation might result in a stronger\ntranscriptional response. This would deviate from the classical\nmodel (and be closer to current views) in that more NR is then\nnot bound to the DNA (Figure 2A, design 2). For someNRs this\nseems realistic, as there areB1000 active REs per cell (e.g., for\nGR REs (de Kloet et al, 2000; Reddy et al, 2009) and for ER REs\n(Lin et al, 2007)) versus B100 000 NR molecules per cell\n(e.g., for GR (Nordeen et al, 1989; Van Steensel et al, 1995)).\nFor other NRs the number of NR molecules in the cell may be\napproximately equal to the number of active REs. Because of\nthe much larger distribution volume for ligand molecules\noutside the cells, which we assume to be at equilibrium with\nthe free ligand in the plasma membrane, we took the\nconcentration of the latter as fixed (i.e., as unaffected by\nbinding of ligand to NR protein) at either 0 or 0.005 nM\n(aqueous). Indeed, allowing NR to diffuse freely through the\nDesign principles of nuclear receptor signaling\nAN Kolodkin et al\n4 Molecular Systems Biology 2010 & 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited\nnucleus, a higher concentration of ligand-bound NR in the\nnucleus was calculated than for the model of the previous\nsection, which had all NR bound to the DNA, at a concentra-\ntion even higher than that of RE. This occurred even though\nonly a small fraction of NR proteins would have ligand bound.\nIndeed, the transcriptional response now reached B60% of\nthe maximal response (design 2, Figure 2B).\nWhat cytosolic NR could contribute?\nOur simulations show that although the designwith excess NR\nled to an increased steady-state response, the response was\nslow (B25min; Figure 2C, design 2), because ligand flowing\ninto the nucleus was sequestered by binding to the excess NR,\nand initially the flux of ligand across the cytosol was unable to\nkeep up with the demand leading to limitation of activation.\n0.8\n\u2013Design 6\n\u2013Design 6\n\u2013Design 6\n\u2013 \u2013Design 5\n\u2013 \u2013Design 5\n\u2013 \u2013Design 5\n\u2013Design 2\n\u2013Design 2\n\u2013 \u2013Design 2\u2013Design 4\n\u2013Design 4\n\u2013In complex with NR (design 4)\n\u2013In complex with NR (design 6)\n\u2013 \u2013 In complex with NR (design 5)\n\u2013 \u2013Free diffusion (all design 5)\n\u2013Design 4\u2013Design 3\n\u2013Design 3\n\u2013Design 3\n\u2013 \u2013Design 1\n\u2013Design 6\n\u2013 \u2013Design 5\n\u2013Design 2 \u2013Design 4\n\u2013Design 3 \u2013 \u2013Design 1\n\u2013 \u2013Design 1\n\u2013Design 1\n0.6\n5 10\nt (min)t (min)\nB C\nE\nG\nD\nF\nt (min) t (min)\n2015 250 30\n5\n15\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n10 2015 250 30\nt (min)\n5 10 2015 250 30\n5\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n10 2015 250 30\nt (min)\n5 10\n\u2013Mixed, shuttling\n\u2013 \u2013Mixed, no shuttling\n\u2013 Cyt, shuttling\n\u2013 \u2013 Cyt, no shuttling\n\u2013Nuc, shuttling\n\u2013 \u2013Nuc, no shuttling\n2015 250 30\n5\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0[L\niga\nnd\nn\n]\/[\nLig\nan\nd c\n]\n10 2015 250 30\n0.4\n0.2\n1.0\nDesign 1\nDesign 4\n2\n(fixed)\n(fixed) Design 5 (fixed) Design 6 (fixed)\n3\n4\n3\n5 6\n(fixed) (fixed)Design 2 Design 3\n0.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n1.0\n0.0\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\nN\nuc\nle\nar\n in\nflu\nx \nof\n li\nga\nnd\n(\u00d7\n10\n\u2013\n12\n \nn\nM\n\/m\nin\n)\nN\nR\nn\nu\nc \nto\nta\nl (n\nM)\nTo\nta\nl N\nR\nn\nu\nc \nlig\nan\nde\nd \n(n\nM)\n(N\nRL\nn\nu\nc \n+\n R\neN\nR\nL n\nu\nc)\nTr\nan\nsc\nrip\ntio\nna\nl\nre\nsp\non\nse\nTr\nan\nsc\nrip\ntio\nna\nl\nre\nsp\non\nse\nA\nNr\nNr\nReRe\nReReReNr\nReNr\nNr\nNr\nRe\nRe NrRe\nReRe\nNrRe Nr\nNr Nr\nNr\nNr Nr Nr Nr Nr Nr\nNr Nr Nr NrNr\nNPC NPC\nNr\nNrm Nrm\nNr\n2\n2 22\n4 4 4\n3 3 3\n5 5 5\n6 6\n2\nNucleusNucleusNucleus\nNucleusNucleusNucleus\nNuclear membrane\nPlasma membrane\nCytoplasm\nNuclear membrane\nPlasma membrane\nCytoplasm\nNuclear membrane\nPlasma membrane\nCytoplasm\nNuclear membrane\nPlasma membrane\nCytoplasm\nNuclear membrane\nPlasma membrane\nCytoplasm\nNuclear membrane\nPlasma membrane\nCytoplasm\n1\n111\n11\nFigure 2 The expected performance of six different network designs for NR signaling. (A) The six alternative network designs studied: Design 1: Passive diffusion of\nligand, which binds directly to the DNA-bound NR. Design 2: NR functioning as NR only, with passive cytoplasmic diffusion of ligand, the NR being in vast excess over RE\nbut confined to the nucleus and helping ligand associate with the RE. Design 3: NR functioning both as NR and as cytosolic shuttling protein. Design 4: NR functioning\nboth as NR and as shuttle from plasma membrane all the way to the DNA, with free NR also shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm, picking up ligand near the cellular\nmembrane. Designs 5 and 6: active import of the NR, without preferences for import between liganded and core-NRs (design 5), or with core-NR having lower import into\nthe nucleus than NRL (design 6). (B) Transcriptional response to a sudden increase in extracellular ligand (hormone), for the six network designs of (A). The\ntranscriptional response is taken to equal the ratio ReNrL\/Retotal, i.e., the fraction of REs attaching ligand-bound NR. The ligand concentration was increased from 0 to\n0.005 nM and maintained constant at the latter level. The observation that design 6 is higher than all other designs at long times is robust for parameter changes up to a\nfactor of 3. (C) Time courses of the concentration ratio of nuclear over cytoplasmic ligand for the six network designs. The insert enlarges the early events. (D) Time\ncourses of the nuclear influxes of ligand for the six network designs. Nuclear influx of ligand by free diffusion is equal in all models (gray dashed line). In addition, ligand is\nimported complexed with the NR (designs 4\u20136). (E) Time courses of the concentration of the total NR in the nucleus for the six network designs. (F) Time courses of\nconcentration of total ligand-bound receptor in the nucleus (NRLnuc + ReNRLnuc) for the six network designs. (G) Transcriptional responses (taken to equal the ratio\nReNrL\/Retotal) for different initial localizations of NR. Different initial localizations of the NR were achieved by adjusting the import\/export activity ratios of core-NR (nuclear\nlocalization\u2014red line; equally distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm\u2014black line; cytoplasmic localization\u2014blue line). The transcriptional response is shown for both\nhigh shuttling (solid line) and almost no shuttling (dashed line). Calculations were carried out for a model built according to design 6 (ligand-bound NR having preference\nfor nuclear import). Rate equations and kinetic parameters are given in Supplementary information: Supplementary Table 1 for design 1; Supplementary Table 2\nfor design 2; Supplementary Table 3 for design 3; Supplementary Table 4 for design 4; Supplementary Table 5 for design 5 and Supplementary Table 6 for design 6.\nSupplementary Figure 4S shows simulation results for all species in all models.

Figure 2G can be reproduced by populating design 6\nmodel with parameters from Supplementary Table 6.\nDesign principles of nuclear receptor signaling\nAN Kolodkin et al\n& 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited Molecular Systems Biology 2010 5\nThe lipophilic nature of NR ligands causes them to\naccumulate in membranes due to partition coefficients of well\nover a thousand (B2500 in the case of cortisol; Oren et al,\n2004). Although this facilitates passage across the plasma\nmembrane, it should make traversing the cytosol to reach the\nnucleus more difficult. As the distance between plasma\nmembrane and nuclear membrane vastly exceeds the diameter\nof the plasma membrane, this issue may not be trivial. We\npropose that in addition to their DNA binding and transcrip-\ntion activation role, NRs serve as ferry boats for NR ligands;\nligand binds to the lipophilic NR ligand-binding pocket and is\ntransported from one cellular location to another, which is\nsimilar to the transport of fatty acids by fatty acid binding\nproteins (Weisiger, 2002). We calculated whether, and how,\ncytosolic shuttling of the NR may realistically enhance\nsignaling by picking up ligand from the cytoplasm near the\nplasma membrane and releasing it near the nucleus, using\nrealistic kinetic parameters and ditto cytoplasmic and nuclear\nvolumes.\nOur design 3 (Figure 2A) had the NR equally distributed\nbetween the nucleus and the cytoplasm, without NR\nbeing able to traverse the nucleocytoplasmic membrane.\nLigand was ferried through the cytosol by the cytoplasmic\nfraction of the NR, then entered the nucleus and associated\nwith the nuclear NR fraction to initiate a transcriptional\nresponse. We modeled the diffusion as a single movement\nfrom close to the plasma membrane, where the NR was\npresent at concentration Nrc, to a position close to the nuclear\nmembrane, where the NR had a concentration Nrm. We set\nthe diffusion coefficient for NR equal to 1\u000310\u000412m2 s\u00041. This\nvalue was used earlier in the models addressing protein\ndiffusion (Kholodenko et al, 2000a), where the diffusion\ncoefficient of model protein was taken in the order of\nmagnitude of experimentally measured diffusion coefficients\nof various proteins, e.g., GFP (Dayel et al, 1999). The\ndiffusion coefficient for cortisol was taken to be 6-times higher\nthan the diffusion coefficient of the NR, as estimated from the\nStokes\u2013Einstein equation. Although the NR diffuses more\nslowly than the far smaller ligand molecule, the constant high\nligand concentration in the cellular membrane, combined with\nthe concentration of the NR being higher than the concentra-\ntion of free ligand in the cytosol, allowed for higher\nconcentration of the ligand\u2013NR complex, as compared with\nthe concentration of the free ligand. Consequently, increased\nfluxes of ligand molecules were carried from the plasma\nmembrane to the nuclear membrane by diffusing NR\ncomplexes, and the steady state was reached some 25-times\nfaster than that in design 2 (Figure 2B and C; compare design 3\nto design 2).\nWhat shuttling of the NR across the nuclear\nmembrane may contribute?\nIf the NR can also traverse the nucleocytoplasmic membrane,\nthe response can be even faster than that in design 3 (design 4,\nFigure 2B and C). Again, more ligand molecules would be\ncarried from the plasma membrane to the nuclear membrane\nin NR complexes than in the free form (Figure 2D). However,\nas also in this model some of the NRs reside in the cytoplasm\n(which holds close to 80% of the cellular volume), the nuclear\nNR concentrations are much lower than they would have been\nhad all NRs been confined to the nucleus (Figure 2E). In turn,\nthis causes REs not to be saturated by receptors, resulting in\na lowered steady-state transcriptional response (Figure 2B;\ncompare designs 3 and 4 with design 2).\nWe conclude that if the ligands for NR signaling are highly\nhydrophobic, their non-chaperoned diffusion through the\ncytosol would limit the rate at which transcription responds\nto changes in extracellular signal. The use of a more\nhydrophilic NR protein as a \u2018ferry boat\u2019 (in addition to the\nuse of the latter in transcription activation) may enable the\nhormone to diffuse faster into the nucleus, but this could occur\nat the cost of the extent of the transcriptional response, due to a\nlower concentration of the receptor in the nucleus.\nHow the active nuclear import of NR may help?\nUp to this point we considered the permeation of the NR\nthrough the nuclear membrane to be passive, implying\nan import\/export activity ratio of 1. When we took the\nimport\/export activity ratio very high (such as in design 5\nin Figure 2A), active NR concentrated in the nucleus\n(Figure 2E), with a positive effect on activation of transcription\n(Figure 2B, design 5). Consequently, depending on the ratio of\nimport to export activity, design 5 reflects a trade-off between\nthe fast responsiveness of design 4 and the high sensitivity\nof design 2 (compare the transcriptional response graph in\nFigure 2B).\nWhy both importin and exportin are needed; how\nactive import and export of NR can enhance\nresponse speed and extent?\nIn order to maximize responsiveness, core-NR should be\nconcentrated in the cytoplasm, whereas to gain sensitivity,\nliganded NR (NRL) should be concentrated in the nucleus.\nThis suggests that performance could be improved by making\nnuclear import and export selective for liganded over\nunliganded NR (Figure 2A, design 6). Molecularly, this\ncould be based on the facts that liganded and core-NRs\nhave different affinities for transport proteins and that two\ndifferent types of transport protein (importins and exportins)\nare involved in NR signaling, one for import and one for\nexport (see Figure 1).\nIndeed, retention of core-NR in the cytoplasm (design 6)\nprovides high influx of ligand into the nucleus, especially\nwhen complexed with NR (Figure 2D), and also produces the\nhighest concentration of ligand in the nucleus (Figure 2C).\nDesign 6 provides transcriptional responses higher than design\n2 and almost as quick a response as established by design 4\n(Figure 2B). As shown by Figure 2C, only in design 6 the\nconcentration of ligand becomes higher in the nucleus than in\nthe cytosol; the system functions to pump ligand actively into\nthe nucleus. Interestingly, design 6 has the paradoxical\nimplication that reduced net import of the NR into the nucleus,\ndue to selectivity in the import for liganded-NR over core-NR,\ncan enhance signaling.\nDesign principles of nuclear receptor signaling\nAN Kolodkin et al\n6 Molecular Systems Biology 2010 & 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited\nNR does not wait in the cytoplasm for the signal,\nbut it is advantageous if it shuttles continuously\nAbove we have shown that the retention of core-NR in the\ncytoplasm improves the sensitivity and responsiveness. This\nresult could leave the impression that the higher the fraction\nof core-NR residing in the cytoplasm when ligand arrives, the\nhigher transcriptional response. In the designs presented in\nthe following, if import and export activities of core-NR were\nequal (Figure 2G, black line), then unliganded NR was equally\ndistributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, a situation\ndenoted as \u2018mixed, shuttling\u2019. A high ratio of import to export\nactivities for unliganded NR resulted in a predominant\nlocalization of core-NR in the nucleus (Figure 2G, red lines).\nIn comparision, a low ratio resulted in the localization of core-\nNR in the cytoplasm (Figure 2G, blue lines). For all three cases,\nthe import rate constant of NRLwas taken to be 50-times higher\nthan the import rate constant of core-NR resulting in an increase\nof nuclear concentration of the receptor after the addition of\nligand. In order to evaluate the importance of the absolute\nshuttling rate, the import and export rate constants of both core-\nNR and NRL were all decreased 10 000-times, keeping constant\nthe import\/export ratio (Figure 2; solid lines show high\nshuttling rate; dashed lines show the decreased shuttling rate).\nIn all three cases examined, shuttling without changing the\ninitial concentration gradient of NR helped to increase the\nresponsiveness of transcription (Figure 2G, compare solid and\ndashed lines). Moreover, for high shuttling rates, both the\nsensitivity and the responsiveness can be very high. In fact,\nthis is even higher when preferences are achieved by\ndecreasing the import of core-NR (compare high shuttling for\nmixed and nuclear localization of core-NR in Figure 2G with\nthe results for design 6 in Figure 2B). Interestingly, both at very\nhigh and at very low import\/export ratios of core-NR, the\ntranscriptional responses were slower (Figure 2G). Therefore,\nwe conclude that high shuttling activity is always advanta-\ngeous, but this advantage can be further increased through an\noptimal import\/export ratio, which results in the optimal\nsubcellular localization of the NR before the onset of the\nsignaling response.\nActive export rather than active import of importins\nis the best strategy to enhance transcription\nAbove we demonstrated that NR shuttling allows for ferrying\nof ligand that both speeds up and amplifies the transcriptional\nresponse, especially if it is accompanied by selective and active\nimport of NRL into the nucleus. Such selectivity requires a\nprotein for the recognition of liganded versus core-NR protein\ncomplex. This yields a further aspect of the complexity of NR-\nmediated signaling, namely, the role of the importin protein\nthat facilitates transport of NRL across the nuclear membrane\nthrough the NPC. To establish whether an increased importin\nconcentration would be advantageous, we considered, for the\nmost obvious topology (active import of the importin\u2013NRL\ncomplex; Figure 3B), that more importin can help, but may not\nalways do so (the gray line in Figure 3D). At high concentra-\ntions importin inhibited the transcriptional response in silico.\nThis occurred when importin concentrations exceeded the\ntotal NR concentration (Figure 3E, full gray line). In this case,\nmost of the NR was sequestered by the importin. This\nphenomenon was not only unique to the active transport\nmechanism but also occurred when transport was passive\n(dotted line in Figure 3E).\nThe thermodynamic driving force of GTP hydrolysis could\nalso be coupled to the export of free importins (Figure 3C).\nParadoxically, the latter topology, i.e., active nuclear export of\nimportins (Figure 3C), turned out to be the most advantageous\ndesign: also at high importin concentrations, it supported a\nhigh transcriptional response (black line in Figure 3D). The\nimportin concentration in the cytosol was now much higher\nthan the importin concentration in the nucleus, and therefore\nthe importin concentration gradient itself drove the import of\nNR, while the NR sequestration in the nucleus by nuclear\nimportin was small.\nAll calculations shown in Figure 3 are based on the\nassumption that NR degradation is much slower than the\nsignaling process and, consequently, does not affect signaling.\nIt has been demonstrated that ubiquitination of NRs, targeting\nthem for proteasomal degradation, occurs when NRs are\nbound to their REs (Liu and DeFranco, 2000). When we\nincorporated NR degradation in our models, we continued to\nfind that active nuclear export of importins benefited the\ntranscriptional response (Supplementary Figure S1).\nFlux through the NPC may be robust even if all\npathways run through the same pore\nAll large proteins that are subject to nucleocytoplasmic transport,\nas well as all RNAs, pass through the NPC (Tran and Wente,\n2006). The design of the NPC as a single unspecific pore appears\nto impose a limitation, as all transported macromolecules,\nirrespective of function, would compete for transport. Onemight\nthen expect that the transport pathways depend strongly on each\nother\u2019s activity. Functionally unrelated molecular networks\ncould, therefore, exhibit inadvertent crosstalk.\nWe used metabolic control analysis (Burns et al, 1985) and\nenzyme kinetics to examine this issue in a generic model,\nwith a single NPC (Figure 4A). As reported in more detail\nin the Supplementary information, the nuclear import rate of\neach particular signaling protein (xi, with yi representing its\nimported form) through the NPCwas described by a reversible\nkinetic equation incorporating competitive inhibition by other\ncargo from both sides of the nuclear membrane. When many\nother cargo proteins compete for transport and their individual\nconcentrations become small relative to the total cargo\nconcentration, several simplifications apply. First, the nuclear\nimport rate (vi) becomes proportional to the cytosolic\nconcentration of the corresponding cargo (xi) and the\ncorresponding elasticity coefficient, i.e., the log-log depen-\ndence of rate on concentration (Burns et al, 1985), approaches\n1, whenever the gradient of substance i across the nuclear\nmembrane is sizeable (i.e., xibyi):\nvi \u0005 VMAX\n1\u00fe Pn\nk\u00bc1\nk 6\u00bci\nxk\nKxk\n\u00fe Pn\nk\u00bc1\nyk\nKyk\nxi\nKxi\nevixi \u0006\nq ln vi\nq ln xi\n\u0002 \u0003\nxj\n\u0005 1 \u00f0n\u0007 1; yj \b xi\u00de\nDesign principles of nuclear receptor signaling\nAN Kolodkin et al\n& 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited Molecular Systems Biology 2010 7\nVMAX and the Kxk are constant rate characteristics of transport\nof species k.\nSecond, the rate becomes independent of the concentration\nof any specific other cargo molecule, including the already\nimported forms, causing all cross-elasticity coefficients to\nbecome zero:\nvi \u0005\nVMAX \u0002 xiKxi\n1\u00fe Pn\nk\u00bc1\nk 6\u00bcj\nxk\nKxk\n\u00fe Pn\nk\u00bc1\nk 6\u00bcj\nyk\nKyk\n;\neviyj \u0006\nq ln vi\nq ln yj\n\u0002 \u0003\nxj\n\u0005 0; eviyi \u0005 0; 8j 6\u00bc i \u00f0n\u0007 1; yj \b xi\u00de\nConsequently, all pathways should become independent of\neach other. When the same pore is used for the transport of\ndifferent cargoes, the concentration level of each cargo is far\nbelow the concentration that by itself would challenge the\ncarrying capacity of the transport system. By analogy, at rush\nhour, two roads leading into a roundabout influence each\nother\u2019s traffic intensely, if they are the only two, but exert\nrelatively little influence, if there are 10 other roads feeding\ninto the roundabout.\nNumerical simulations confirmed this scenario, whereby\nwhen the number of NR pathways (n) exceeded 6, \u2018cross-\ncontrol\u2019 of the flux of one NR by other receptors was close to\nzero (Figure 4C), leaving most control over the transport of an\n(Reversible pore)\n\u2013 \u2013Reversible pore\nReversible pore\u2013 \u2013\n0.8\nD E\nA B C\n0.8\n\u2013Active export of importins\nActive export\n\u2013Active import Active import\u2013\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n1.0\n0.0Tr\nan\nsc\nrip\ntio\nna\nl r\nes\npo\nns\ne\nSe\nqu\nes\ntra\ntio\nn\n10\u20134 0.01\nImptotal \/Nrtotal\n1 10010\u20136 104 10\u20134 0.01\nImptotal\/Nrtotal\n1 10010\u20136 104\n(Active import) (Active export)\nFigure 3 Active export of importins rather than active import of the importin\u2013NR complex is advantageous for enhancing the transcriptional response.

Paradoxically, the high\npromiscuity of the NPC prevents crosstalk between different\nNR pathways.\nDiscussion\nOnly a fewmain categories of signal transduction govern gene\nexpression activity in response to extracellular signals. The\ndistinction is largely in the physico-chemical properties of the\nsignal molecule. For example, extracellular signals carried by\nhydrophilic molecules, such as epidermal growth factor, bind\nreceptors in the plasma membrane. In this category, no\nsignaling molecule is transported across the membrane, but\na signal is, through changes in the state of a transmembrane\nreceptor. This leads to the increased local concentration\n(Kholodenko et al, 2000b) just below the plasma membrane\nof a single protein, alters the state of other membrane-\nanchored molecules, such as RAS, and indirectly the states of\ncomponents of a MAP kinase cascade. A phosphorylated\nprotein at the end of such a cascade then binds to a gene-locus\ncontrol region and activates transcription. In this type of signal\ntransduction, no molecule needs to move all the way from the\noutside of the cell to the chromatin.\nIn a second category, and the subject of this study, the\nextracellular signal is a hydrophobic molecule, thereby able to\ncross the plasma membrane by itself. That hydrophobic\nmolecule then moves even further to the nucleus and binds\nto aNR,which then activates transcription. In this category not\njust a signal but also a signal molecule moves all the way from\noutside the cell to the targeted genomic region.\nIt would seem that in this second category of signal trans-\nduction, only a signal-activated transcription factor would\nneed to be involved. That transcription factor would be\nthe only protein \u2018receiving the signal\u2019. In this scenario, this\n\u2018receptor\u2019 could indeed be only located in the nucleus and\nawait the hydrophobic signalingmolecule to arrive. The design\nof this category seems to excel by simplicity, which would be\nwelcome in our attempts to comprehend cell function.\nIn this study, we tested whether this category of signal trans-\nduction actually follows this simplest design. We constructed\nthe common denominator network for NR signaling.We found\nthat even this common denominator was nowhere near as\nsimple as this design. We then identified eight aspects of the\nnetwork topology where reality appears to be more complex\nandwe found reasonswhy all eight topologies were supportive\nof the function of signal transduction. A first and general conclu-\nsion of our study is that most, if not all, aspects were somewhat\nimportant; all contributed at least somewhat to signaling. The\nimportance of each of the different aspects may become clear\nwhen applying these models to specific and individual NRs;\nthen a more or less subtle balance of the various topological\ncontributions may emerge. In this manner, we have generated\na valuable tool kit for the NR research community.\nThe current assessment used generic mathematical models\nto identify potential functions of these topological features.\nThe first, for the classical design 1 of Figure 2, showed\nsignificant disadvantages of exclusively nuclear localization of\nxi yi\nxi+1 yi+1\nxi+2 yi+2\nyn\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\ns\ns\ns\ns\np\np\np\np\nV1i V3i\nV3i+1\nV3i+2\nxn\nNPCCytoplasm Nucleus\nV2i\nV1i+1 V2i+1\nVn Vn Vn\nV1i+2\nA\n1\n0.8\nB C 0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\u20130.1\n\u20130.2\n\u20130.3\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n2 4 6 8 10 12\nn n\n\u2013Output\n\u2013 \u2013 Input\n\u2013Output\n\u2013NPC\n\u2013 \u2013Input\n\u2013NPC\n\u2013 \u2013Summation over path j \u2013 \u2013Summation over path j\n14 16 18 20\nflu\nx \npa\nth\n k\npa\nth\n j\nC\nflu\nx \npa\nth\n j\npa\nth\n j\nC\nV2i+2\nFigure 4 Control properties of NPC transport in the case of excess competing processes.

Note that (i) the import and export of proteins, i.e.,\nx\u2019s and y\u2019s, compete for the transport (all reactions are dependent on substrates and products), (ii) the pathways do not exchange mass flow between each other but only\nregulatory influences (competitive inhibition); this system displays an hierarchical design (Kahn and Westerhoff, 1991) and (iii) the cycling of importins etc. between\nnucleus and cytosol is not taken into account.

Supplementary Figure 6S shows simulation results for all species.\nDesign principles of nuclear receptor signaling\nAN Kolodkin et al\n& 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited Molecular Systems Biology 2010 9\nthe NR: when all NR was constitutively bound to the DNA, the\ntranscriptional response was very low, perhaps paradoxically\nso. A high concentration of free NR in the nucleus improved\nsensitivity, but made the responsiveness slow (B25min).\nForward rate constants for all association reactions in our\nmodels were chosen as diffusion limited. In reality their values\ncould be lower; this would slow down the response even\nfurther. On the contrary, experimental measurements indicate\nfaster formation of the GR\u2013RE complex (B10min). Moreover,\nthis time is mostly composed of a slow lag-phase, after which\nthe formation of GR\u2013RE complex is very fast (B1min;\nStavreva et al, 2009). Consequently, the slow responsiveness\nthat exclusively nuclear NR localization would entail is not\nonly disadvantageous, but also less realistic.\nOur modeling next indicated a considerable increase of the\nrate of response when the NRwas allowed to enter (and leave)\nthe cytoplasm, but at the cost of sensitivity. We predicted the\neffect of additional cytoplasmic localization of NRs to be\nsubstantial yet subtle: highly hydrophobic NR ligands moved\nmostly in association with their specific NR. In our model, NR\nbound ligand in the proximity to the cellular membrane, where\nwe considered the aqueous concentration of ligand to be low,\nas it should be mostly in the bordering hydrophilic phase.\nInside the membrane, the concentration of the hormone\nshould be many times higher (Oren et al, 2004). Hence, a\nscenario could be envisaged, whereby the NRmight contribute\nmore to ligand movement if it could directly collect the ligand\nfrom the membrane. In fact, the latter scenario is quite\nrealistic. Recently, it was shown that 5\u201310% of total cellular ER\nis found at the plasmamembrane (Levin, 2009b), where it may\ninteract with GPR30 and induce rapid signaling through, e.g.,\np38-b MAP kinase. The scenario that liganded ER may leave\nthemembrane surfacewas not considered. There is experimental\nevidence suggesting that liganded ER may leave the plasma\nmembrane and head for the nucleus. For example, fluores-\ncence microscopy experiments in ROS cells (Spona et al, 1980;\nOng et al, 2004) showed that before addition of estrogen, ERa-\nRFP was distributed over the nucleus and cytoplasm, but after\naddition of estrogen, all receptor shifted to the nucleus. This\nshould alsohave depleted anypool close to theplasmamembrane.\nThe transport system could be considered to involve three\nconveyor belts, including one that would consist of importin\ncycling and another one exportin cycling. RanGTPbinds competi-\ntively with NR to importin with the effect that the outward\ndriving force of RanGTP (outward because of the activity of\nRanGEF in the nucleus and RanGAP in the cytosol) makes the\nimportin belt transport the NR more inward than outward.\nConversely, RanGTP binds positively cooperatively with NR to\nexportin, causing the RanGTPase driving force to make the\nexportin conveyor belt export NR. Together, the exportin and\nimportin conveyor belts serve for a rapid cycling of NR, which\nshould ensure a rapid response of transcription to changes in\nsignal concentration in the cytosol, without amplifying the signal\nintensity. If the importin cycle were more active with NRL as\ncargo, and\/or the exportin cycle more active with core-NR, an\nadditional signal amplification effect should arise (design 6).\nImportin and exportin conveyor belts together then drive the\ncycling of the third conveyor belt, consisting of the receptor\nthat brings ligand into the nucleus. Consequently, apart from\nits classical role in transcription activation, the NRmay be also\nused as a \u2018smart\u2019 ferry boat: coming into the nucleus with\nligand and leaving the nucleus when empty. As both binding\nof ligand to the receptor and binding of ligand-bound receptor\nto DNA are reversible stochastic processes (Voss et al, 2009),\na single ligand-bound receptor in the nucleus may either bind\ndirectly to DNAor may loose the ligand; then the core-receptor\nmay either bind a new ligand molecule or may be exported out\nof the nucleus. The probability of each event would depend on\nthe relative magnitudes of the relevant parameters. The \u2018ferry\nboat\u2019 is \u2018smart\u2019 because (i) it likes to have ligand on board\nwhen it \u2018sails\u2019 into the nucleus, but not when it \u2018sails\u2019 out, and\n(ii) when it dwells in the nucleus it likes to bond to the DNA\nand activate transcription.\nAn important outcome of preferential import of ligand-\nbound receptor and export of core-receptor (design 6) is that it\nwould be the only design where the addition of ligand would\nresult in the observable shift of NR intracellular localization.\nFor realistic parameters, e.g., of GR signaling, an addition of\n0.1 nM of DEX should increase the total GR concentration in\nthe nucleus from 15 to 30% (Supplementary Figure S2B). An\naddition of 1 nM of DEX should increase the fraction of total\nnuclear GR even further, up to 70% (Supplementary Figure\nS2C). These model predictions are consistent with the results\nof single dose experiments described before in the literature\n(Kumar et al, 2004; Charmandari et al, 2005, 2007) and\nexperimentally confirmed (Supplementary Figure S3).\nOur analysis proved that, paradoxically, the transport of all\ncargo through the same NPC makes the transport of any\nparticular cargo robust with respect to perturbations in the\navailability of any other cargo. Only when the transport of any\nindividual cargo is greatly increased, does a competition effect\nat the transport level become significant. The design of having\nmany different signaling and bulk transport routes share the\nsame mechanism, may be a way to reduce competition until\nthe situation arises, where the energetic capacity of the system\nas a whole would be compromised. The emergent flux\nindependence due to the utilization of a single NPC for many\ntransport systems should have general implications. The effect\nhas indeed been observed experimentally: single-molecule\nvideo microscopy indicated that nuclear import dynamics are\nmainly determined by cargo\u2013NR\u2013pore interactions and are\nrobust to other cell processes and other transported molecules\n(Dange et al, 2008). This is not to say that there are no other\ndesigns that would avoid competition. Clearly, giving all\ntransported species their own transporter operating far below\nits Vmax should also make their transports independent of one\nanother and provide the ability to increase it when needed.\nHowever, this would require higher totals of transport proteins,\nat a higher synthetic burden to the cell. The single pore mecha-\nnism seems an attractive design alternative.\nOur calculations predict that there is an optimal ratio of\nnuclear to cytoplasmic fractions of the NR that depends on the\nspecific properties of the ligand and on the transcription\nactivation requirements. This may help to explain the\nobservation that different NRs have different predominant\nintracellular localizations. For instance, the VDR is present\nboth in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and after the addition of\nligand its nuclear\/cytoplasmic ratio increases only slightly\n(Racz and Barsony, 1999; Menezes et al, 2008), but GR is\nconcentrated in the cytoplasmbefore ligand addition and shifts\nDesign principles of nuclear receptor signaling\nAN Kolodkin et al\n10 Molecular Systems Biology 2010 & 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited\ninto the nucleus upon addition of ligand (Pru\u00a8fer and\nBoudreaux, 2007; Ricketson et al, 2007). This issue warrants\nfurther study, whichwill require interaction betweenmodeling\nand quantitative experimentation, and again the tool kit\ngenerated in the current study may provide a welcome\nresource with which to test and analyze these predictions.\nBecause the earliest (\u2018classical\u2019) paradigms of NR signaling\nhad the NR attached to its RE, \u2018waiting\u2019 for its ligand (Brink\net al, 1992; Van Steensel et al, 1995), pathology related to NR\nsignaling was attributed mostly to the concentration of ligand,\nthe expression level and the integrity of the NR. At present, it is\nwell known that the NR is not always attached to chromatin\nand that its intracellular localization is important for signaling.\nClinical data support the latter paradigm. For instance,\nalterations of the nucleocytoplasmic ratio of the VDR are\ncorrelated with the progression of lung cancer (Menezes et al,\n2008). Our analysis of design principles shows that the\nefficiency of signalingmay depend not only on the intracellular\nlocalization of the NR, as set by the import\/export activity\nratio, but also on the absolute rate of nucleocytoplasmic\nshuttling. This rate emerges from the whole network of\nGTPase-dependent reactions involved in nucleocytoplasmic\ntransport. It suggests new etiologies, as well as new potential\ndrug targets.\nThis study readdressed the significant complexity of NR\nsignaling, in a novel way. Whereas the diversity of these\nnetworks is accepted generally, it is rarely discussed which\ntopological aspects are important for which aspects of\nbiological function. Assessing this importance was the novel\ncontribution of the current study by using mathematical\nmodels based on realistic physical, chemical and biological\ndata. We have not been able to address all complex aspects of\nNR signaling. For example, it is well established that many\nligands for NRs are also substrates for metabolism by the\ntarget genes of said NRs; hence, 1,25D3 activation of the\nVDR results in increased CYP24\/24-hydroxylase expression,\nwhich is responsible for 1,25D3 degradation. We have also not\nconsidered the full mechanism of transcription activation\ndownstream of the formation of the NR\u2013ligand\u2013DNA complex;\nNR dimerization, co-repressors and co-activators complexa-\ntion and chromatin modulation. Whereas we acknowledge the\nimportance of these processes, and appreciate that they may\nimpact upon the total network response, it is important to\nfocus on a clearly defined network module, allowing a\nfocussed examination of the design principles underlying\nnucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Figure 1). We discussed eight\naspects of this part of signaling together, rather than just one or\ntwo: multiple mechanistic aspects turned out to be important\nat the same time; i.e., the complexity of Figure 1 may really\nhave offered selective advantage in evolution.\nThe models that we have produced (and are available to the\nreader) were relatively generic. Yet further testing may also\nhelp verify which design principles are most functional in\nactual signaling pathways. For this, actual parameter values\nwill need to be inserted, which can result in an important\nintegration between more modeling and more experimenta-\ntion. The design principles we have identified may well be\nin more general use and may also be important for yet\nother signal-transduction pathways, such as SMAD signaling\n(Nicolas et al, 2004; Dupont et al, 2009).\nIn conclusion, in this study we have shown that complex\nnetworks of biochemical and signaling reactions can harbor\nsubtle design principles that can be understood rationally in\nterms of simplifiedmodels. Of course, these predictions should\nbe substantiated in experimental studies of specific cases of NR\nsignaling that in turn may reveal additional design aspects.\nMaterials and methods\nThe SBGN graphical network notation for the \u2018canonical\u2019 endocrine NR\nsignaling network (Figure 1) has been constructed using CellDesigner\nversion 4.1 beta. The CellDesigner SBML-compliant free package has\nbeen downloaded from Kitano et al (2005). Our mathematical models\ndid not address this network as awhole, but parts thereof. For Figures 2\nand 3 these simplified models have been built with the following\nassumptions.\nWe have simplified the formation of the ligand\u2013NR\u2013RE complex in\ndesigns 2\u20136 (Figure 2) by considering it as only one process: binding of\nligand to NR and binding of the ligand\u2013NR complex to RE. Possible\noccurrence of NR\u2013RE complex (binding of unliganded NR to RE\nfollowed by binding of ligand) has been omitted. This is the only\nsimplification possible when one needs to accommodate NR diffusing\nindependently of the DNA.\nInstead of considering importin-a and -b as separate complexes, the\nsingle importin-a\u2013importin-b complex has been noted as a single\nimportin protein. This simplification is warranted as described in the\ndetailed scheme in Figure 1: importin-a first binds to importin-b and\nsubsequently the complex binds cargo. This sequence of events is\nsupported by the observation that importin-a contains an N-terminal\nautoinhibitory domain that blocks the NLS binding site. Binding of\nimportin-b unmasks this autoinhibitory blockage and allows importin-\na to bind cargo proteins with high affinity (Catimel et al, 2001; Riddick\nand Macara, 2005).\nWe did not consider the NPC complexes explicitly for the models\npresented in Figures 2 and 3. Taking into account the large number of\nNPCs (B2000 per cell) and their relatively homogeneous distribution,\nwe modeled the overall transport of cargo through the area of a\nmembrane.\nThe translocation of importins across the nuclear membrane has\nbeen considered as a single reaction, reversible and symmetrical. In\nreality it is a complex biochemical network of reactions, in which\nimportins interact with many other proteins, such as RanGTP, adaptor\nproteins, Hsp90 and filaments of the NPC (Figure 1). The translocation\nthrough nuclear pores is always reversible (Kopito and Elbaum, 2007).\nUltimately, the direction of transport is determined by the nucleocy-\ntoplasmic gradient of RanGTP. This gradient is maintained by the\nexclusively cytoplasmic hydrolysis of RanGTP stimulated by RanGAP,\nwhich is associated with the cytoplasmic side of the NPC complex, and\nthe exclusively nuclear regeneration of RanGTP by GEF associated\nwith chromatin. The steady state of the RanGTP gradient is the net\nresult of the transport of many cargo molecules and of the distinct\nlocalization and efficiency of GAP and GEF. NRs make up only a small\nfraction of cargo involved in the global process. Consequently, they do\nnot much affect transport of other cargoes, including other NRs. If\nthere is excess RanGAP and RanGEF activity and excess GTP, RanGTP\ngradients can be considered as externally fixed and can be presented\nin terms of kinetic parameters of a single reaction. Our calculations\nreflect these assumptions by keeping the ratio of forward to reverse\nrate constants for active transport constant (e.g., Figure 2, design 5).\nWe did not keep this ratio at the very high level corresponding to\nthermodynamic equilibrium, but at a ratio of 100, acknowledging the\nnon-equilibrium nature of the process (Westerhoff, 1985).\nNR was considered to bind ligand in the proximity to the cellular\nmembrane, where the concentration of ligand is low, as it should be in\na hydrophilic phase. In fact, inside the membrane the concentration of\nthe hormone should be many times higher (Oren et al, 2004) and NR\nmight contribute even more to the movement of ligand if it could\ndirectly collect the ligand from the membrane (this possibility is\nconsidered in the Discussion section).\nRealistic cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment volumes, 1.55 and\n0.45 pL, respectively (Riddick andMacara, 2007), have been used in all\nDesign principles of nuclear receptor signaling\nAN Kolodkin et al\n& 2010 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited Molecular Systems Biology 2010 11\nmodels. The total concentrations of RE and NR were set to realistic\nvalues, i.e., 1.7\u000310\u000412 nmoles (1000 molecules) per cell for the RE\n(De Kloet et al, 2000) and 1.7\u000310\u000410 nmoles (100 000 molecules) per\ncell for NRs (Nordeen et al, 1989; Van Steensel et al, 1995). The rate\nconstants for complex formation of hormone with NR were chosen as\ndiffusion limited (values for GR and cortisol analog dexamethasone,\nkassociation\u00bc1nM\u00041 s\u00041 and Kd\u00bc1 nM (Marissal-Arvy et al, 1999)). Rate\nconstants for complex formation of the ligand-bound NR to the RE\nwere chosen to be diffusion limited as well (values for GR and cortisol\nkassociation\u00bc1nM\u00041 s\u00041 and Kd\u00bc1nM (Drouin et al, 1992); the diffusion\ncoefficient for NR was taken equal to 1\u000310\u000412m2 s\u00041. This value was\nused earlier in the models addressing protein diffusion (Kholodenko\net al, 2000a), where the diffusion coefficient of model protein was\ntaken in the order of magnitude of experimentally measured diffusion\ncoefficients of various proteins, e.g., GFP (Dayel et al, 1999). The\ndiffusion coefficient for cortisol was assumed to be 6-times higher\nthan this, as estimated from the Stokes\u2013Einstein equation and the\nrelative sizes. The external concentration of free ligand was taken to\nchange abruptly from 0 to 0.005 nM. The model used for Figure 4 is\nillustrative in nature and has been built neither taking into account the\ndifferences in nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes nor the physiological\nparameter ranges.\nBalance equations, rate equations and kinetic parameters for all\nmodels are presented in the Supplementary information. For all models,\nthe ODEs have been solved numerically using the Mathematica6\ncommercial package. All models are also available in cps format for\nsimulation in COPASI. In addition, the models are made available\nin JWS Online and can be simulated in a web browser: http:\/\/\njjj.biochem.sun.ac.za; http:\/\/jjj.bio.vu.nl; http:\/\/jjj.mib.ac.uk (Snoep\nand Olivier, 2002; Olivier and Snoep, 2004).\nModels can be found using the regular menu, for instance,\nvia author search \u2018kolodkin\u2019.

Our conclusions were mostly robust for up to fivefold\nchanges in parameter values, but the precise details are given below.\nFigure 2 (Supplementary Table 11): Design 6 is the most\nadvantageous. This conclusion was not affected by at least fivefold\nperturbation of any single parameter in the model. The only exception\nwas related to the rate of nuclear import of NRL. If active nuclear\nimport of NRL in design 6 is decreased more than threefold, then\nthe advantages of design 6 as compared with design 2 almost\ndisappear. This fits well in the context of the main messages of our\nmanuscript. Indeed, an advantageous feature of the design 6 is exactly\nthe active import of ligand into the nucleus achieved by preferential\nnuclear import of the NRL.\nFigure 3 (Supplementary Table 12): Active export of importins\nprevents sequestration of the receptor in the nucleus by importins.\nThis conclusion was not affected by l0-fold perturbation of any single\nparameter in the model.\nFigure 4 (Supplementary Table 13): Flux through the NPC may be\nrobust even if all pathways run through the same pore. This conclusion\nwas not affected by l0-fold perturbation of any single parameter in\nthe model.\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information is available at the Molecular Systems\nBiology website (www.nature.com\/msb).\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank various EC framework programs (notably, the Marie Curie\nresearch training network NucSys, BioSim, NISB, EC-MOAN, YSBN,\nUNICELLSYS), NWO-FALW,NWO-ZON (contract grant number: 91206069),\ntheBBSRC (BBC0082191 [MCISB] andERASysBio) and theEPSRC (DTC),\nfor support of some of this work (see also www.systembiology.net\/\nsupport).
