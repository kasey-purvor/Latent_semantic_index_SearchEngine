The magnetoresistance of these films can be described well\nusing a simplified model that incorporates gradation of properties away from the InSb\/GaAs\ninterface and the interplay between conduction and impurity bands. Although there is no significant\nintrinsic contribution in InSb bulk crystalline \u0001001\u0002 materials due to its isotropic Fermi surface and\nmobility tensor, the linear and quadratic terms in the magnetoresistance as well as the overall\nmagnitude can be tuned by varying the film thickness from 100 to 2000 nm. \u00a9 2006 American\nInstitute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2162666\u0004Magnetoresistance \u0001MR\u0002 sensors are employed in many\ndifferent areas, from position sensing in automotive applica-\ntions to magnetic bit sensing in computer hard disks.1 It has\nbeen well established since the 1960s that, in addition to\nusing Corbino geometry, MR can be enhanced by various\nextrinsic processes such as in-plane conductivity inhomoge-\nneity, in-plane geometric pathway inhomogeneity, and the\ngeometry of the electrode placement.2,3 For example, the ex-\ntraordinary magnetoresistance effect produces a huge boost\nto the low-field MR in InSb,4 for possible ultrahigh-density\nrecording media \u0001\u00011 T bit\/ in2\u0002 in nanoscale devices.5\nRecently, it has been shown that a material with a high\nmobility and a small but linear MR patterned into the\nCorbino geometry6 will yield a high-field unsaturating MR\nbehavior. It is interesting that materials which offer such in-\nherent MR properties are often little understood. A model\nbased on compositionally inhomogeneous material with mo-\nbility inhomogeneity in the plane has been proposed7 to ex-\nplain the unsaturating linear MR. In this letter, we demon-\nstrate that another form of inhomogeneity\u2013mobility\ninhomogeneity perpendicular to the plane \u0001MIPP\u0002, explored\npreviously in the context of the galvanomagnetic properties\nof samples with surface layers8,9 or heterojunctions,10\u201313 pro-\nduces large MR even in thin films and is inherent to InSb\nfilm growth. We show that the overall magnitude and linear-\nity of the MR can be tuned over a large range by varying the\nfilm thickness, in the present study from 100 to 2000 nm. We\nalso introduce an approximate model, based on appropriate\nsimplifications, that describes the salient features and rein-\nforces our understanding of the films.\nInSb films were grown by molecular-beam epitaxy on\nsemi-insulating GaAs\u0001001\u0002 substrates in a VG Semicon V80\nsystem with a base pressure of 10\u221210 mbar.

Both \u0005 and \u0006 increase for thinner films while the\nlinearity ratio peaks at 1 \u0002m.\nAlthough bulk InSb has an isotropic Fermi surface and\nmobility tensor and therefore lacks intrinsic MR, our results\ncan be understood qualitatively once it is appreciated that\ninherent MIPP occurs in the films. Quasi-linear MR behavior\narises from magnetic-field-induced changes to the current\ndistribution, with the major fraction being forced to flow in\nprogressively lower mobility regions \u0001nearer the interface\u0002 as\nthe magnetic field is raised. In order to create MR of signifi-\ncant magnitude, which is also unsaturating and has a linear\ncomponent, the film needs to have a wide range of mobility\npresent. This would explain the maximization of the MR at a\nthickness where the surface layers have reached high, bulk-\nlike mobility but the degraded layers underneath still play a\nsignificant role in conduction. A full theoretical description\nof the MR behavior of these InSb films is extremely complex\nand beyond the scope of this letter; however, most of the\nsalient experimental results can be explained using a simpli-\nfied model with the following features:\n\u0001a\u0002 Current can flow in the conduction band \u0001CB\u0002 and an\nTABLE I.

Unlike the isolated\nlayer model,11\u201313 we also assume the same lateral elec-\ntric field distribution at all depths, since we expect \u0001i\u0002\nthe graded nature of the samples, \u0001ii\u0002 the overlap of\npotential distributions from adjacent planes, and \u0001iii\u0002\nany current in the growth direction acting to minimize\nthe field differences. This is equivalent to the formal-\nism of Kane et al.,10 which is experimentally more ap-\npropriate than the isolated-layer model for dissimilar\nlayers in close proximity;11\n\u0001d\u0002 The depth-dependent properties have been derived\nfrom a differential Hall analysis of the samples, which\nreplaces the continuous distribution of parameters by a\nstep-like one, for both types of conducting channels.\nIn order to extract the properties for each step, we as-\nsume that for a series of N samples of various total thick-\nnesses ti, \u0001i=1 to N, with all ti\u0001 ti\u22121\u0002, each sample of thick-\nness ti can be considered as consisting of a top layer of\nthickness \u0001ti\u2212 ti\u22121\u0002, and an underlying layer with the same\nproperties as the sample of thickness ti\u22121.
