INTRODUCTION\nThis paper extends the work of Refs. 1 and 2 by consid-\nering the effect of a uniform axial flow on the type I and II\nmodes of convective instability within the boundary-layer\nflow over a rotating disk. This paper is part of a series by the\npresent authors which consider the convective instability of\nthe boundary-layer flow over a family of rotating cones\n(including the disk as the limiting half angle) both in and out\nof axial flow. This series commenced with an investigation\ninto a family of cones rotating in an otherwise still fluid3\nusing both numerical and asymptotic methods, as is done\nhere. The mathematical formulation of the rotating-disk\nproblem in axial flow is necessarily different to that for the\nrotating cone and this motivates separate publication of the\npreliminary cone investigation in Ref. 4.\nThe transition of the boundary layer on the surface of\nrotating disks and cones has been the subject of a number of\nexperimental investigations. These were motivated by the\ndesire to understand transition to turbulence of crossflow vor-\ntices, present in three-dimensional boundary layers. Although\nwe are unaware of experimental investigations explicitly into\nthe vortex dynamics within boundary-layer flows over rotat-\ning disks placed in axial flow, equivalent experimental inves-\ntigations on broad cones (half-angle> 40!) placed in axial\nflow are extensive. Early experimental work on such cones\nwas limited to measurements of the transitional Reynolds\nnumbers.5\u20138 Following these, detailed flow visualizations and\nhot-wire measurements by Kobayashi and Izumi,9 Kobayashi\net al.,10 and Kohama11 demonstrated the existence of\nco-rotating spiral vortices in the non-turbulent part of the\nboundary layer, which are fixed on the cone for all rotation\nand axial flow rates. These vortices are identical to those\nobserved on the disk rotating in still fluid12,13 and on the\nrotating sphere.14 Such vortices are known to arise from type\nI (crossflow) and type II (streamline curvature) modes of\ninstability. More recently, the experimental investigations of\nCorke and co-workers15\u201317 on disks rotating in otherwise still\nfluid have shown that traveling modes can be important in\nthe transition process over smooth, clean disks.\nOur interest in the rotating-disk boundary layer arises\nfrom the desire for completeness in the series of papers on\nthe family of rotating cones and also from industrial applica-\ntions in the electrochemical industry, in particular. Here,\nflows arising from rotating disks are present in types of\nchemical vapour deposition (CVD) reactors used for deposit-\ning thin films of optical and electrical materials on sub-\nstrates. Such reactors operate by forcing a carrier gas\n(containing the reactive molecules) onto the substrate held\nwithin a disk-like support placed horizontally in the flow.\nThe set-up is contained within a closed reactor and the sup-\nport is rotated to compensate for any non-uniformity of the\nincident flow. The gas flow can be considered as a uniform\naxial flow incident on a rotating disk and it is desirable that\nthe flow close to the substrate be laminar and free from insta-\nbility to ensure uniform deposition. Although a large amount\nof literature exists on the theoretical and experimental study\nof the reactor-flow parameters (see Refs. 18\u201320 and referen-\nces contained therein), these are concerned with the changes\nin the laminar-flow profiles that can be achieved and the\neffect these have on deposition growth rates; no stability\nanalyses exist for the flows in question. We pay particular\nattention to Ref. 18 which considers a simple laminar-flow\nmodel that is closely related to the basic flow used in the sta-\nbility investigation presented here. Although the temperature\nand compressibility of the carrier gas are important in the\nphysical process of deposition and are indeed considered in\nRef. 18 and all following laminar-flow investigations, the\nincompressible study presented in this paper can be\n1070-6631\/2011\/23(11)\/114108\/13\/$30.00 VC 2011 American Institute of Physics23, 114108-1\nPHYSICS OF FLUIDS 23, 114108 (2011)\nDownloaded 30 Nov 2011 to 143.210.42.241.

There the rotating disk is considered as\na special case of cone with half-angle 90!. As can be seen in\nthose papers, the onset of absolute instability is sensitive to\nthe imposed axial flow rate and the location of onset is sig-\nnificantly delayed with increased flow. Absolute instability is\nnot considered further here.\nThe current paper begins with a description of the math-\nematical formulation of the problem in Sec. II and outlines\nthe asymptotic stability analyses in Sec. III. We subsequently\nproceed to study the neutral curves for stationary modes of\ninstability using complementary asymptotic and numerical\nmethods in Sec. IV. The asymptotic analysis for stationary\nmodes is presented in more detail in Ref. 22, while the nu-\nmerical analysis is used to study the linear growth rates\nwithin the unstable regime. Traveling modes are subse-\nquently studied in Sec. V using two distinct formulations.\nThe first is in the rotating frame of reference and presents\nneutral curves and growth rates for disturbances traveling at\nfixed frequencies, in an approach that is consistent with, for\nexample, Turkyilmazoglu and Gajjar\u2019s work.23\u201325 Both as-\nymptotic and numerical approaches are used. The asymptotic\napproach models traveling modes in axial flow for the first\ntime, and as such builds on the analyses in Hussain\u2019s Ph.D.\ndissertation22 (still fluid) and23\u201325 (traveling modes). Mean-\nwhile, the second formulation is in the inertial (stationary)\nframe of reference and considers disturbances traveling at\nfixed phase speeds with respect to the disk surface. This is\nrelated to Garrett\u2019s recent numerical studies of the rotating\ndisk, cone, and sphere boundary layers26\u201328 where disturban-\nces traveling at around 75% of each body\u2019s surface are found\nto be most amplified. This is consistent with Kobayashi and\nArai\u2019s29 experimental observation of slow vortices over\nrotating spheres under particular conditions. In the analysis\nof stationary modes, identical neutral curves arise in the two\nframes of reference. Furthermore, in the analysis of traveling\nmodes, the two formulations lead to neutral curves which\nmust be compared at specific values of the local Reynolds\nnumber. Following this approach, we observe excellent\nagreement for a range of traveling modes in axial flow.\nII. FORMULATION\nThe asymptotic and numerical investigations presented\nin this paper use slightly different formulations. We give a\nsummary of the formulation used in the asymptotic investi-\ngation here and mention the amendments relevant to the for-\nmulation of the numerical investigations at relevant points in\nthe text.\nConsider a rigid disk of infinite extent rotating about the\nz*-axis which passes through the center of the disk. The ra-\ndial and azimuthal coordinates are x* and h, respectively,\nwhich rotate with the disk surface. The disk is placed in an\nincompressible fluid with oncoming axial flow aligned paral-\nlel to the z*-axis at upstream infinity. At the edge of the\nboundary layer, the dimensional surface velocity distribution\nalong the disk is given by the well-known potential-flow so-\nlution U\"0 x\n\"\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc C\"x\" (see Refs. 30 and 31 for example).\nHere, C* is a scale factor determined by the free-stream axial\nflow incident on the disk. Asterisks indicate dimensional\nquantities. A diagram of the formulation can be seen in\nFigure 1 of Ref. 21 when setting the half-angle to w\u00bc 90!.\nThe non-dimensionalization of the asymptotic study\nfollows that detailed in Ref. 3 when w\u00bc 90!, leading to the\nReynolds number\nR \u00bc X*l*\n2\n!*\n: (1)\nHere, X* is the angular speed of rotation of the disk, l* is\na characteristic length scale along the disk surface, and !*\nis the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. Distances in the\nz*-direction are scaled on the boundary-layer thickness\nd*\u00bc (!*=X*)1=2, leading to the non-dimensional variable\nf\u00bc z*=d*. We note that the boundary-layer thickness is\nO(R&1=2). Note that this scaling is different to that used in\nRef. 18 and this is discussed in Sec. VI.\nThe basic steady flow over the disk has the form\nxU(f; Ts), xV (f; Ts), and R\n&1=2W(f; Ts) in the radial,\nazimuthal, and normal directions, respectively, and these are\ndetermined by the non-dimensional Navier\u2013Stokes and\ncontinuity equations at leading order,\nW0 \u00fe 2U \u00bc 0; (2)\nWU0 \u00fe U2 & \u00f0V \u00fe 1\u00de2 \u00bc T2s \u00fe U00; (3)\nWV0 \u00fe 2U\u00f0V \u00fe 1\u00de \u00bc V00; (4)\nsubject to boundary conditions\nU \u00bc 0; V \u00bc 0; W \u00bc 0; on f \u00bc 0;\nU !

LINEAR STABILITYANALYSIS\nWe consider type I and type II modes in order to derive\nestimates of the wavenumber cd\" and waveangle \/ of the\nresulting disturbances in the large Reynolds number limit.\nTo derive the linear disturbance equations, we introduce\nsmall perturbations around the basic flow which lead to gov-\nerning equations independent of Ts and identical to those\ngiven by Eqs. (3.1)\u2013(3.4) of Ref. 3. The analysis of each\nbasic-flow profile determined by Ts= 0 then proceeds in a\nsimilar way to that given in Refs. 1,3, and 22. For this rea-\nson, we focus on the quantitative differences that arise in the\nanalysis of Ts= 0 and present only a brief overview of the\nmethods used. The interested reader is referred to Refs. 1,3,\nand 22 for full details.\nA. Inviscid type I modes\nPhysically, modes of type I are known to arise from an\ninflection point in the mean velocity profiles and are inviscid\nin origin. To analyse these modes, the disturbance wave-\nlengths are scaled on the boundary-layer thickness. A small\nparameter e \u00bc R&16 is introduced and we define the perturba-\ntion velocities and pressure as functions of the wall-normal\ncoordinate z\u00bc f\"3 in the form,\n\u00f0~u; ~v; ~w; ~p\u00de \u00bc \u00f0uA\u00f0z\u00de; vA\u00f0z\u00de;wA\u00f0z\u00de; pA\u00f0z\u00de\u00de\n( exp i\n\"3\n\u00f0x\naA\u00f0x; \"\u00dedx\u00fe bA\u00f0\"\u00deh& \"xAt\n\" #$ %\n:\nThe disturbances associated with these perturbations are neu-\ntrally stable and hence aA and bA are considered as real quan-\ntities. We proceed by expanding the radial and azimuthal\nwavenumbers as well as the traveling mode frequency in the\nform,\naA \u00bc a0 \u00fe \"a1 \u00fe ) ) ) ;\nbA \u00bc b0 \u00fe \"b1 \u00fe ) ) ) ;\nxA \u00bc x0 \u00fe \"x1 \u00fe ) ) ) ;\nwhere the perturbation radial velocity in the inviscid layer is\nexpanded as\nuA \u00bc u0\u00f0f\u00de \u00fe \"u1\u00f0f\u00de \u00fe ) ) ) :\nSimilar expansions are used for vA, wA, and pA, and the\nresulting perturbation equations are solved at each order.\nConsequently, for the first order eigenmodes, follow-\ning Ref. 1, we observe the existence of two layers: an\ninviscid layer of thickness O(\"3) and a viscous layer of\nthickness O(\"4) to incorporate the no-slip condition at the\nwall, which is found by balancing convection and diffusion\nterms in the disturbance equations. Subsequently, we pro-\nceed to match the leading-order solution in the wall layer,\nusing the wall-normal coordinate r\u00bc \"&4z, to the first-\norder solution in the inviscid layer to arrive at the follow-\ning eigenrelation:\nw0\u00f00\u00de2Ai0\u00f0s0\u00de\nc\n\u00d01\ns0\nAi\u00f0s\u00deds \u00bc 2 a0a1\u00fe\nb0b1\nx2\n$ %\nI1\u00fe a1b0\n&b1a0\nb20\n !\nI2\u00fex0!I3:\n(6)\nHere w is the leading-order Rayleigh eigenfunction, normal-\nised such that its wall-gradient w0(0)\u00bc 1. Furthermore,\nc\u00bc [i(a0xU0(0)\u00feb0V0(0))]1=3 and the integrals I1, I2 are\ndefined and calculated numerically in Refs. 1,3, and 22.\nMeanwhile, the eigenrelation differs from the stationary\nmodes case only in the Airy function terms on the left-hand\nside as well as the addition of the third term on the right-\nhand side, which is observed also by Turkyilmazoglu and\nGajjar23 for traveling modes over a rotating disk in still\nfluid. The wall layer normal coordinate is re-scaled to give\ns\u00bc cr\u00fe s0, where s0\u00bc&ix0=c2 and the integral, as defined\nin Ref. 24 for the still fluid problem is\n!I3 \u00bc\n\u00f01\n0\nw20\u00f0h\u00de\n!U\n00\u00f0h\u00de\n!U\n2\u00f0h\u00de dh:\nThe effective velocity profile !U \u00bc a0xU \u00fe b0V is defined in\nRefs. 1,3, and 22. In a similar fashion to I2 in Refs. 1,3, and\n22, !I3 is calculated using numerical integration and the resi-\ndue theorem due to the singularity present at the location of\nthe inviscid critical layer, where !U \u00bc !U00 \u00bc 0. The values of\n!I3 corresponding to axial flows in the range Ts\u00bc 0\u20130.25 are\ngiven in the Appendix.\nB. Viscous type II modes\nPhysically, modes of type II are known to originate from\nviscous effects close to the disk boundary. To analyse these\nmodes, we consider a triple-deck structure to be built on a\nsmall parameter, now given by \" \u00bc R& 116. The lower, main,\nand upper decks have thicknesses of order \"9, \"8, and \"4,\nrespectively, and we define inner variables n, f, and Z to rep-\nresent O(1) variation within these decks. The wavenumbers\nare scaled upon a viscous length-scale, so that the velocity\nand pressure perturbations become\nFIG. 1.

THE ANALYSIS OF STATIONARY MODES\nA. Asymptotic analysis in the rotating frame\nFor both type I and type II modes, the asymptotic analy-\nses for stationary modes correspond directly to the lack of\ntime-dependent terms in the linearised perturbation equa-\ntions. Hence, the absence of the traveling mode frequency\nsuch that xA\u00bc 0 leads to the simplification of both the invis-\ncid and viscous stability analyses. For type I modes, there is\nno need to calculate the integral !I3, whereas for type II\nmodes, the integral I5 is not required; both are eliminated\nfrom the process of solving eigenrelations (6) and (7),\nrespectively.\n1.

Numerical analysis in the inertial frame\nThe numerical study uses the length scale provided by\nthe boundary-layer thickness in all spatial scalings, and we\nconsider the disk to be rotating in a fixed frame of reference.\nThis formulation is consistent with that discussed in the rele-\nvant sections of Refs. 3,4,21,26\u201328 and permits control of\nthe speed at which vortices rotate with respect to the disk\nwithin the analysis.34\nThe mean flow is found by solving equations equivalent\nto Eqs. (2)\u2013(4) but with amendments due to the different\nframe of reference. The governing disturbance equations are\nthen formed by perturbing the mean flow with quantities\n\u00f0u^; v^; w^; p^\u00de \u00bc \u00f0u\u00f0f\u00de; v\u00f0f\u00de;w\u00f0f\u00de; p\u00f0f\u00de\u00de exp\u00f0i\u00f0ax\u00fe bRLh& ct\u00de\u00de:\nThe quantity a is complex and b and c are real, as required\nby the spatial analysis used here. It is assumed that b is O(1).\nAs defined above, RL is the local Reynolds number that\narises from using the boundary-layer thickness as the length\nscale, whereas the non-dimensional normal distance variable\nf is defined in the asymptotic analysis.\nThe governing perturbation equations in this formula-\ntion are identical to those given as Eqs. (4.2)\u2013(4.7) in Ref. 3,\nand we see that the effect of Ts= 0 is to change the basic\nflow on which the analysis is performed. The analysis on\neach basic flow is similar to that described in Ref. 3 and\ninterested readers are referred there for further information.\n1. Neutral curves\nWe begin by explicitly assuming that the vortices rotate\nwith the surface of the disk; this involves fixing the disturb-\nance phase velocity c\u00bc c=b\u00bc 1. Spatial branches for each Ts\nhave been plotted by solving the dispersion relation for com-\nplex a\u00bc ar\u00fe i ai at fixed RL by marching through values of\nc\u00bcb. This approach has been denoted method 2 in Ref. 26.\nAt each Ts, two spatial branches are found to determine the\ninstability of the flow, with behavior similar to those shown\nin Figure 7 of Ref. 3. These branches arise from crossflow\n(type I) effects and streamline-curvature (type II) effects.\nThe associated neutral curves (described by ai\u00bc 0 at each\nRL) have two distinct lobes with the larger lobe, character-\nized by higher wavenumbers, due to the type I instability,\nand the smaller lobe due to the type II instability. The neutral\ncurve calculated for Ts\u00bc 0 is identical to that calculated by\nMalik.2\nFigures 2 and 3 show a comparison between the numeri-\ncally calculated neutral curves and asymptotic estimates at\nhigh Reynolds number, in terms of the wavenumber\nkd \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\na2 \u00fe b2\np\nand waveangle \"\u00bc arctan(b=a) which are\nidentified with the asymptotic quantities cd\" and \/, respec-\ntively. We see excellent agreement between the numerical\nand asymptotic predictions of wavenumber and waveangle\nfor both modes of instability, even though different frames\nof reference and formulations have been used.\nFigures 2 and 3 show that the type I mode remains the\nmost dangerous (has lower critical RL) for the values of Ts\nconsidered. However, as the axial flow rate is increased, the\ntype II mode becomes more important. Figure 4 shows the\nneutral curves in terms of ar for Ts\u00bc 0\u20130.40, and we see that\nthe type II mode has become the most dangerous by\nTs\u00bc 0.40.

The type II modes should, there-\nfore, become dominant as Ts increases. Plots of the effective\nvelocity profile, Q(f; U, Ts)\u00bcU(f; Ts) cos (U)\u00feV (f; Ts) sin\n(U), resolved at an angle from the radial direction in the\ndirection of rotation, U, show the presence of an inflection\npoint at certain values of U for all values of Ts (see Figure 5\nfor example). Hence, the type I mode is expected to exist at\nall axial flow rates, as is observed in Figure 4.\nThe asymptotic analysis assumes that the effective wall\nshear is zero along the lower (type II) branch. This assump-\ntion is not necessary in the numerical investigation and\nindeed we are able to justify it using the numerical formula-\ntion. The effective wall shear along the lower branch can be\ncalculated from the values of aU0(0; Ts)\u00fe bV0(0; Ts) along\nthe type II branch of the numerical results. This quantity is\nidentified with Eq. (8) from the asymptotic investigation and\nhas been investigated for Ts\u00bc 0\u20130.40. We can confirm that\nits value tends to zero as RL increases and is consistent with\nthe equivalent calculation of Ref. 2 for Ts\u00bc 0.\n2. Linear amplification rates\nWe have so far shown that the critical Reynolds number\nfor the type II mode is reduced relative to the type I mode as\nthe axial flow rate is increased. However, in order to better\nunderstand the mode selection process in practice, it is nec-\nessary to consider the linear growth rates of both modes\nthrough the convectively unstable region. In doing this, we\nfollow the analysis of Ref. 26 that considers linear growth\nrates within the rotating-disk boundary layer for Ts\u00bc 0. That\nwork has since been extended to the boundary-layer flows\nover the family of rotating cones and spheres by Garrett27,28\nwith a view to understanding the vortex-speed selection pro-\ncess over smooth bodies (see Sec. V).\nIn order to compare the effect of incident axial flow, the\namplification rates over an equal extent of RL are required.\nWe have chosen to consider a region of extent of 215 in RL.\nThis is approximately the extent of the convectively unstable\nregion for Ts\u00bc 0 until local absolute instability is encoun-\ntered at RA * 507, as determined by Lingwood.35,36 This is\nknown to be close to the experimentally observed onset of\nturbulence for a rotating disk (see Ref. 37 for example), and\nso for comparison purposes can be interpreted as the extent\nof spiral vortices within the boundary layer. However, recent\ninvestigation by Healey38 suggests that edge effects of the\nrotating disk may contribute to the linear global instability of\nthe flow, and that infinite rotating disks may remain globally\nstable despite the existence of local absolute instability. Fur-\nthermore, axial flow is known to significantly delay the onset\nof absolute instability and so potentially the onset of turbu-\nlence (see Refs. 4 and 21). Hence, a range of RL should be\nconsidered, and so to facilitate the comparison, an extent of\n215 is used for all Ts> 0.\nFigure 6 shows the amplification rates of stationary\nmodes through a convective unstable region of around 215\nFIG. 3.

We see that the amplification rates are signifi-\ncantly reduced with axial flow and the type II mode becomes\nincreasingly important relative to the type I mode. For suffi-\nciently high axial flow rates, the amplification rates of the\ntype II mode is expected to become larger than the type I\nmode and could be selected in practice. However investiga-\ntions have showed that this would be at rates far in excess of\nT\u00bc 0.40. Similar behavior has been found in the rotating-\nsphere boundary layer in Ref. 28.\nV. THE ANALYSIS OF TRAVELING MODES\nAs discussed in Sec. I, the recent experimental investi-\ngations of Corke and co-workers, for example, have shown\nthat non-stationary modes can be important in the transi-\ntion process over smooth disks. This is particularly rele-\nvant in the CVD application where highly polished and\nclean surfaces are used. It is important to note that this\nexperimental observation is consistent with the theoretical\ninvestigations into the boundary-layer flow over a disk\nrotating in otherwise still fluid due to Turkyilmazoglu and\nGajjar.23\u201325 There, results are presented which demonstrate\nthat disturbances arising from the type II mode moving at\ndifferent speeds relative to the disk surface can have con-\nsiderably lower critical Reynolds numbers than the station-\nary type I mode.\nThe stability of traveling disturbances for different val-\nues of Ts is considered here using two distinct approaches.\nThe first is consistent with the rotating-frame analyses in the\nliterature referred to above, and both numerical and asymp-\ntotic analyses are presented within this frame. The second\napproach is via method 2 within the inertial frame, as dis-\ncussed in Sec. IV B. Although it was possible to compare the\nrotating-frame asymptotic analysis with the inertial-frame\nnumerical analysis in Sec. IV B, this was only because sta-\ntionary disturbances were being considered. The approaches\nin the different frames are inconsistent for traveling modes\nand direct comparisons of the neutral curves are not possible.\nA. Rotating-frame asymptotic analysis\nWe now consider the case of traveling modes of\nfrequency xA for type I and type II disturbances. In both\ncases, the stability analyses presented are similar to\nSec. IV A for stationary modes. However, the inclusion of\ntime-dependence in the disturbance equations leads to an\nadditional terms in the eigenrelation for both the inviscid and\nviscous modes. These distinguish the analyses from those\npresented in Ref. 22 for stationary modes and Refs. 23\u201325\nfor traveling modes in still fluid.\n1. Inviscid type I modes\nThe inviscid traveling mode analysis reveals the non-\nexistence of time-dependent terms in the leading order solu-\ntion. As a result, we recover the leading-order estimates for\nthe stationary type I modes, so that for any xA= 0 the\nleading-order wavenumber AIt \u00bc AIs and the leading-order\nwaveangle CIt \u00bc CIs for varying axial flow strengths Ts; in the\nstill fluid case of the rotating disk, the same is observed by\nTurkyilmazoglu.24\nAs in Sec. III A, we proceed to solve Eq. (6) for x0= 0\nand re-scale in terms of the Reynolds number based on\nboundary-layer thickness RL. Hence, we arrive at the first-\norder corrections for the type I wavenumber cId\" and wavean-\ngle \/I, which are given by\ncId\" \u00bc AIt & BItR&1=3L \u00fe ) ) ) (13)\nand\ntan\np\n2\n& \/I\n( )\n\u00bc CIt \u00fe DItR&1=3L \u00fe ) ) ) ; (14)\nwhere the numerical values of BIt and D\nI\nt are given in\nTable III for values of xA corresponding to numerical\ntraveling-mode frequencies x\u00bc&5, 4, 7.9, and 10 at\nRL\u00bc 107 (see Sec. V B for a definition of x).\n2. Viscous type II modes\nIn the upper and main decks, the analysis leads to\nEq. (8), due to the requirement of zero effective wall shear.\nHence, at leading-order, the traveling mode solution for the\nwaveangle \/II agrees with the stationary mode case, so that\nCIIt \u00bc CIIs . Qualitatively, the effects of time-dependent terms\nin \/II do not appear until the first-order problem is consid-\nered within the lower deck.\nFIG. 6.

The\nperturbation equations are not stated here but are identical to\nthose stated as Eqs. (14)\u2013(19) in Ref. 35. To facilitate\ncomparisons with experiments where the frequency spectra\nof traveling disturbances are studied explicitly (rather than\nvortex speeds observed), we work in terms of a dimension-\nless frequency x\u00bc cRL (see Refs. 15\u201317 for example).\nWe proceed to calculate neutral curves for fixed x,\nwhich determines c at each location determined by RL.\nEnforcing x> 0 is interpreted as analysing modes that travel\nat speeds greater than the disk surface. However, the\nazimuthal wavenumber b is now a free parameter and so this\nanalysis differs from the inertial-frame analysis in that we\nare not fixing the phase speed of disturbances.\nThis approach is entirely consistent with the theoretical\ninvestigation of Ref. 23 for Ts\u00bc 0, and we use those results to\nvalidate the amended version of our code in this frame of\nreference. Figure 9 shows neutral curves of the wavenumbers,\nwaveangle, and number of vortices n for various x that are\nidentical to those shown in Figure 5 of Ref. 23. In particular,\nfor x> 0, we see the exaggeration of the lower lobe leading\nto lower critical Reynolds numbers for the type II mode, and\nfor sufficient x< 0, the lower lobe is removed. We see that a\nglobally minimum critical Reynolds number of RL\u00bc 64.47\noccurs for a type II mode when x\u00bc 7.9. This critical Reyn-\nolds number (and indeed all characteristics calculated for\neach x) agrees with those of Turkyilmazoglu and Gajjar to\nthe second decimal place. However, as discussed in Ref. 3,\nour previous numerical and asymptotic analyses have failed\nto reproduce their \u201ckink\u201d in the lower branch at very high RL.\nThat the type II mode is exaggerated for disturbances\ntraveling more quickly than the disk surface is consistent\nwith the results of the inertial-frame analysis presented in\nSec. V D, although quantitative comparisons of neutral\ncurves are not possible between the two formulations.\nFigure 10 demonstrates the effect of increasing the\nenforced axial flow rate. As with the stationary-mode analy-\nsis of Sec. IV B, axial flow is seen to stabilise the flow\nto traveling modes of both types. For each Ts, increasing x\nis again seen to exaggerate the relative importance of\nthe type II mode such that it becomes the most dangerous.\nThe value of xmin;Ts which gives the globally minimum\ncritical Reynolds number is seen to increase slightly\nwith Ts, in particular xmin,0.05\u00bc 8.4, xmin,0.15\u00bc 10.1, and\nxmin,0.25\u00bc 11.9. Calculations of neutral curves for stationary\ndisturbances within the rotating frame (x\u00bc 0) were found to\nbe identical to those calculated in the inertial-frame analysis\nof Sec. IV B for all Ts.\n1. Linear amplification rates\nAs discussed in Sec. IV B, it is instructive to consider\nthe maximum linear growth rates in each case. We continue\nby doing this in the rotating frame of reference for\nTs\u00bc 0\u20130.25.\nFigure 11 demonstrates that a traveling mode with\nx\u00bc&16.5 is the most amplified in the rotating frame of\nFIG. 9.

This corresponds to a mode traveling\nmore slowly that the disk surface, which is qualitatively con-\nsistent with the prediction of slowly traveling vortices in the\ninertial frame. We also see that the type II mode becomes\nincreasingly important for x> 0, which is again consistent\nwith the results of the inertial-frame analysis. Increasing x\nto around 20 is sufficient for the type II mode to have the\ngreater amplification rate at Ts\u00bc 0. However, the critical\nReynolds numbers for the onset of both of these modes are\nsignificantly higher than those that occur for jxj closer to\nzero; this has implications for the mode selection process as\ndiscussed in Sec. VI.\nInvestigation of traveling modes for Ts> 0 has shown\nthat the frequency of the most amplified mode reduces with\nTs. For example, the most amplified mode (as sampled in the\nlatter part of the convectively unstable region prior to the\nonset of absolute instability) has x\u00bc&22.3 at Ts\u00bc 0.05.\nC. Comparison between asymptotic and numerical\nresults\nIn order to develop consistent comparisons for traveling\nmodes between the asymptotic analysis in Sec. V A and the\nnumerical formulation in Sec. V B, we must compare the\nrespective frequencies used in the normal mode expansions\nof both formulations.\nFor type I modes, xA\"&2 \u00bc x. This leads to xAx&2=3\n\u00bc R&2=3L x, where RL\u00bcR1=2x and \"\u00bcR&1=6. Hence, at large\ndisplacement-thickness Reynolds numbers around O(107)\nand O(1) values of the numerical frequency x, small corre-\nsponding values of xAx&2=3 are required in order to achieve\nrelevant comparisons. For example, for type I modes with\nnumerical frequencies x\u00bc&5 and 4, we require asymptotic\nfrequencies xAx&2=3 \u00bc &0:0001 and 0.0000862, respec-\ntively, in order to compare asymptotic and numerical results\nat the specific displacement-thickness Reynolds number of\nRL\u00bc 107.\nSimilarly, for type II modes, we have xA\"&1 \u00bc x. As a\nresult, xAx&1=8 \u00bc R&1=8L x, where RL\u00bcR1=2x and for the\nviscous modes \"\u00bcR&1=16. Therefore, for large Reynolds\nnumbers and O(1) numerical frequencies, again small corre-\nsponding values of xAx&1=8 enable suitable comparisons. For\nexample, for type II modes with numerical frequencies\nx\u00bc&5 and 4, we require asymptotic frequencies\nxAx&2=3 \u00bc &0:667 and 0.533, respectively, to facilitate com-\nparisons at RL\u00bc 107. Importantly, from Figures 7 and 8, we\nsee that there exists no traveling mode solutions for\nxAx&2=3 > 0:7, which restricts the range of available com-\nparisons with the numerical results.\nFigure 12 shows comparisons applicable at RL\u00bc 9( 104\n(the highest value for which the numerical code could obtain\ntraveling mode results for all x), at Ts\u00bc 0.25 and x\u00bc&5.2\nand 4. We see excellent agreement for the effective wave-\nnumber and waveangle predictions of both mode types\n(where applicable). Although only these particular cases are\nshown here, very similar comparisons were found at each Ts\nand x. The slight discrepancy in the type I effective wave-\nnumber predictions is expected to be a consequence of the\nrelatively low Reynolds number used.\nD. Numerical analysis in the inertial frame\nFull neutral curves and amplification rates for vortices\ntraveling at particular speeds relative to the rotating-disk\nsurface can be computed by changing the value of c within\nthe method-2 analysis described in Sec. IV B, i.e., within the\ninertial frame.\nDisturbance speeds have been considered in the\nrange c\u00bc 0.5\u201320 at each Ts and neutral curves computed.\nFigures 13\u201315 present the neutral curves in terms of ar, n, kd,\nand \" for c\u00bc 0.8, 5, and 20 together with the c\u00bc 1 results\nfrom Sec. IV B. Note that c\u00bc 0.8 corresponds to disturban-\nces traveling at 80% of the disk surface speed, and c\u00bc 5 and\n20 corresponds to disturbances traveling at speeds much\ngreater than the disk surface.\nIn each case, we find that the globally critical Reynolds\nnumber for the type I mode is given for stationary disturban-\nces, c\u00bc 1.

In all cases where c> 1, the type II\nmode is the more dangerous than in the type I mode in the\nsense of lowest critical Reynolds number. Imposed axial\nflow appears to increase the sensitivity of the type II mode to\ndisturbance speed.\nThe result that traveling type II modes are the most\ndangerous (in the sense of lowest critical RL) for all Ts is\nconsistent with the previous theoretical results of Sec. V B.\nHowever, it is important to note that the range of waveangles\nand vortex numbers predicted to be unstable to traveling\nmodes is extremely narrow, which is in a sense a stabilizing\neffect. The narrow range of waveangles and vortex numbers\nappears to be a significant barrier to the selection of quickly\ntraveling modes.\nHow traveling modes are selected in practice is influ-\nenced by the amplification rates within the convectively\nunstable region. Garrett\u2019s previous analysis in Ref. 26 has\nshown that traveling modes with phase speeds of c\u00bc 0.75\nare the most amplified in zero axial flow. Investigation of\nTs> 0 shows that the phase speed of the most amplified\nmode increases very slightly with Ts. For example, the most\namplified mode (as sampled in the latter part of the convec-\ntively unstable region prior to the onset of absolute instabil-\nity) remains at c\u00bc 0.75 for Ts\u00bc 0.05 and is c\u00bc 0.76 for\nTs\u00bc 0.15.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have extended the work of Refs. 1 and\n2 by considering the theoretical effect of enforcing a uniform\naxial flow onto the rotating-disk boundary layer. Both\nstationary and traveling modes have been considered. This\ninvestigation is part of a series by the present authors into\nthe convective instability of the boundary layer over a family\nof rotating cones placed both in and out of axial flow.\nThe introduction of axial flow necessarily affects the equa-\ntions governing the basic flow. For the rotating disk, all\ndependence on the radial position is removed leading to a\nmodified form of the von Ka\u00b4rma\u00b4n ordinary differential equa-\ntions. This does not happen when axial flow is incident on a\nrotating cone with w= 90!, and the resulting analysis is\ndifferent. This crucial difference motivates separate publica-\ntion of the two cases and a preliminary Orr\u2013Sommerfeld analy-\nsis of the rotating-cone boundary layer is presented in Ref. 4.\nA. Stationary modes\nWe began by explicitly studying stationary modes of\ninstability. This is consistent with the existence of surface\nroughness on the disk (as would naturally occur in many\npractical applications) which is known to select stationary\nvortices.\nIncreasing the axial flow rate is found to stabilize the\nrotating-disk boundary layer to both type I and type II sta-\ntionary modes of instability. This is evident from the increas-\ningly narrow range of waveangles predicted to be unstable in\nboth the asymptotic and numerical investigations and also\nfrom the increasing critical Reynolds numbers at the onset of\neither mode predicted by the numerical investigation. The\nnumerical investigation also demonstrates that both station-\nary instability modes are evident in the boundary layer for\nall axial flow rates considered, and, although the type I mode\nis the most dangerous (in the sense of lowest critical Reyn-\nolds number) for low rates of axial flow, the type II mode\nbecomes increasingly important with increased Ts, becoming\nmost dangerous at some critical value around 0.40. Axial\nflow is seen to reduce the amplification rates of stationary\nmodes, confirming again that it has a stabilising effect. It\nalso acts to increase the importance of the type II mode rela-\ntive to the type I mode. However, the type I mode is still the\nmost amplified for all Ts+ 0.40 considered here.\nPhysically, these results are to be expected as increasing\nthe axial flow rate forces fluid towards the disk surface and\nso instabilities are more likely to develop from viscous\neffects close to the wall location.\nThe asymptotic analysis necessarily assumes that the\neffective wall shear is zero along the type II branch, and we\nhave been able to confirm this a posteriori at all Ts using the\nFIG. 14.

The asymptotic and numerical investiga-\ntions have shown consistent predictions of the wavenumber\nand waveangle of disturbances arising from both type I and\nII modes, and excellent quantitative agreement has been\nfound in all cases even though the two problems were formu-\nlated in different frames of reference.\nB. Traveling modes\nIn practical applications where highly polished, smooth\ndisks are used (for example in CVD reactors), non-stationary\nmodes are known to occur in the boundary layer. The stabil-\nity of traveling modes was considered using two distinct for-\nmulations: The first used the rotating frame of reference and\nallowed control of the disturbance frequency within the\nboundary-layer flow (consistent with experiments of the type\nconducted by Corke and co-workers, for example). The sec-\nond used the inertial frame of reference and allowed control\nof the vortex speed with respect to the disk surface (consist-\nent with experiments of the type conducted by Kohama and\nArai on the rotating sphere). Although the two formulations\ndo not facilitate direct quantitative comparisons of neutral\ncurves, there is a common result observed in both cases:\nnamely, the most amplified disturbances are those traveling\nslower than the disk surface. Exactly what this means for\nvortex-speed selection over smooth disks is not clear cut\nsince the type I modes (which dominate the type II modes in\nall cases considered) were found to have higher critical\nReynolds numbers than their stationary counterpart. A bal-\nance is therefore to be struck between the near-stationary\nmodes that occur earlier in the unstable region and the more\namplified \u201cslow\u201d disturbances that occur later on. It is likely\nby the point that the \u201cslow\u201d disturbances can arise, the near-\nstationary modes will have grown sufficiently to remain the\nmost dominant. This is a more subtle process than previously\nproposed in Ref. 26.\nAs with stationary modes, enforced axial flow was seen\nto stabilise the boundary layer by increasing the critical\nReynolds numbers and also reducing the amplification rates\nof both modes. It is also seen to increase the relative impor-\ntance of the type II mode with respect to the type I mode.\nHowever, the type I mode is still dominant for all Ts consid-\nered here. Axial flow is seen to very slightly increase the\nphase speed of the most amplified traveling mode, even\nthough the frequency of the mode becomes increasingly neg-\native with Ts.\nC. CVD applications\nThe scalings used in this investigation are different to\nthose presented by Chen and Mortazavi,18 who investigate\nthe laminar-flow profiles arising from an equivalent (but\ncompressible) model for CVD reactors. Specifically, their\nboundary-layer thickness is considered to be of orderffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n!\"=\u00f0C\" \u00fe X\"\u00dep , which leads to two parameters appearing in\ntheir basic-flow equations: R1\u00bcX*=(C*\u00feX*) and\nR2\u00bcC*=(C*\u00feX*). These parameters can be expressed in\nterms of our single parameter as R1\u00bc 1=(1\u00fe Ts) and\nR2\u00bcTs=(1\u00feTs). Their investigation considers the deposition\nproperties of the laminar flows in the regimes R1\u00bc 0, R2\u00bc 1\n(equivalent to Ts ! 1); R1\u00bc 0.5, R2\u00bc 0.5 (equivalent to\nTs\u00bc 1), and R1\u00bc 1, R2\u00bc 0 (equivalent to Ts\u00bc 0). In terms of\nthese parameters, our investigation has R1\u00bc 1 and R2\u00bc Ts\nwhich is consistent with their formulation when Ts<< 1.\nOur analysis focuses on Ts+ 0.25 and we therefore conclude\nthat the two analyses are consistent in this range. Our formu-\nlation has the advantage that Ts does not appear in the pertur-\nbation equations and Reynolds number, which greatly\nsimplifies the stability analysis and interpretation of results.\nHowever, if we were to consider large axial flow rates (rela-\ntive to rotation rate) then the scalings used in Ref. 18 would\nbe more suitable and compressibility would also need to be\nconsidered.\nDescriptions within Ref. 20 indicate that CVD reactor-\nflows can reach Reynolds numbers of around R, 104, which\ncan be confirmed by noting that a typical length scale within\na reactor is around 10 cm and the substrate can be rotated at\nrates up to 1500 rpm. Our results show that this Reynolds\nnumber is well within the unstable region for all values of Ts\nconsidered. This clearly shows that the stability characteris-\ntics of any reactor-flow design should be considered if the\nlaminar flow is to remain in practice.\nWith regards the simple rotating-disk model of Ref. 18,\ntheir results indicate that the growth rates of deposition\nincrease with both axial flow rate and rotation rate. This is\ndue to the narrowing of the boundary layer which necessarily\nincreases the concentration of reactive molecules close to the\nsubstrate. Our work furthers this conclusion by suggesting\nthat increasing the axial flow rate is to be preferred as it may\nact to preserve the laminar flow over a greater region of the\nsupport disk. However, the impact of compressibility and\ntemperature profiles needs to be considered in the stability\nanalysis to comment further. It is not possible to summarise\nprevious investigations here, although the effect of wall-\ncooling or heating is expected to be significant.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nZ.H. wishes to acknowledge financial support from the\nSchool of Mathematics, University of Birmingham, and the\nEPSRC.
