We identify two challenges for making further 65 \nprogress in this field. One such challenge is to avoid developing more models largely 66 \nfollowing the concept of others (\u2017reinventing the wheel\u2018). The other challenge is to avoid 67 \nfocusing on only one type of model, while ignoring new and diverse approaches that have 68 \nbecome available (\u2017having tunnel vision\u2018). In this paper, we aim at improving the awareness 69 \nof existing models and knowledge of concurrent approaches in lake ecosystem modelling, 70 \nwithout covering all possible model tools and avenues. First, we present a broad variety of 71 \nmodelling approaches. To illustrate these approaches we give brief descriptions of rather 72 \narbitrarily selected sets of specific models. We deal with static models (steady state and 73 \nregression models), complex dynamic models (CAEDYM, CE-QUAL-W2, Delft 3D-Eco, 74 \nLakeMab, LakeWeb, MyLake, PCLake, PROTECH, SALMO), structurally dynamic models 75 \nand minimal dynamic models. We also discuss a group of approaches that could all be 76 \nqualified as individual-based: super-individual models (Piscator, Charisma), physiologically 77 \nstructured models, stage-structured biomass models, trait-based models and learning type 78 \nof models like genetic algorithms and neural networks. Thereafter, we zoom in \u2013 as an in 79 \ndepth example \u2013 on the multi-decadal development and application of the lake ecosystem 80 \nmodel PCLake and related models (PCLake Metamodel, Lake Shira Model, IPH-TRIM3D-81 \n 4 \nPCLake). In the discussion, we argue that while the historical development of each approach 82 \nand model is understandable given its leading principle, there are many opportunities for 83 \ncombining approaches. We take the point of view that a single \u2017right\u2018 approach does not exist 84 \nand should not be strived for. Instead, multiple modelling approaches, applied concurrently 85 \nto a given problem, can help develop an integrated view on the functioning of lake 86 \necosystems. We end with a set of specific recommendations that may be of help in the 87 \nfurther development of lake ecosystem models. 88 \n 89 \nNote: citations are temporarily in bold type face so that it easier to check them 90 \n 91 \nIntroduction 92 \nA large number and wide variety of lake ecosystem models have been developed and 93 \npublished during the past four decades, indicating the strong interest in capturing in a model 94 \nthe essential processes in lake ecosystems (e.g. J\u00f8rgensen 2010). The scientific interest in 95 \nunderstanding fundamental processes in lake ecosystems can be traced back to the seminal 96 \npaper by Forbes (1887) on the lake as a microcosm. Another major purpose has been to 97 \ndevelop predictive tools supporting inter-disciplinary ecosystem management (Carpenter et 98 \nal. 1999), acknowledging the great importance of lake ecosystems for society (MEA 2005). 99 \nThe ecological quality of lakes is threatened by a large number of anthropogenic stress 100 \nfactors, in particular eutrophication, pollution of various types, overexploitation and invasive 101 \nspecies, changes in land use and hydrology in the catchment, and climate change (e.g. 102 \nGulati and Van Donk 2002; MEA 2005; Mooij et al. 2005; Revenga et al. 2005; MacKay 103 \net al. 2009; Jeppesen et al. 2009). 104 \nBut there is also a downside to the large number and variety of models that have 105 \nbeen published. We identify two challenges, one related to the number of models and the 106 \nother to the variety of models. With respect to the number of models, newly developed 107 \nmodels often bear similarities to existing models (\u2018reinventing the wheel\u2019) (e.g. Fitz et al. 108 \n 5 \n1996). For example, as Tian (2006) notes, thirteen functions exist for light forcing on 109 \nphytoplankton growth, five for nutrient limitation, with similar diversity of other key types of 110 \nprocesses. In such cases, it would most likely be more efficient to apply or adopt an existing 111 \nmodel instead of creating a new one. With respect to the variety of models, we identify the 112 \nrisk that the approach taken in any specific model is too narrow and ignores other 113 \napproaches that could be useful or even essential for gaining understanding and making 114 \npredictions (\u2018having tunnel vision\u2019) (e.g. Scheffer 1998, p308). 115 \nBefore starting a lake ecosystem modelling project, it is essential to be aware of 116 \nexisting models and concurrent approaches and to properly conceptualise the issues, the 117 \nvariables, the time and space scales and the desired outcomes for the model simulations 118 \n(Robson et al. 2008). We observe that publications that deal with a wide range of 119 \nconcurrent approaches in lake ecosystem modelling are scarce, although some attempts 120 \nhave been made (Van Nes and Scheffer 2004; Mooij et al. 2009; J\u00f8rgensen 2010) and 121 \nseveral overviews concerning complex ecosystem models have been provided (e.g. 122 \nSchauser and Strube 2007, Reichert and Mieleitner 2008). In this paper we wish to 123 \nproceed further in the direction of integrating lake ecosystem modelling approaches, without 124 \nclaiming to be comprehensive. 125 \nThe ideas published here were stimulated by a collaborative research effort by Dutch 126 \nand Russian scientists funded by a stimulus program of the Netherlands\u2018 Organization for 127 \nScientific Research and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research. The aim of this 128 \nresearch program was to combine the extensive knowledge of the modelling of temperate 129 \nshallow lake ecosystems of the Dutch team (e.g. Janse 2005; Janse et al. 2008) with the 130 \nskilled mathematical knowledge of modelling hydro-dynamic processes of the Russian team 131 \n(e.g. Belolipetsky et al. 2010; Genova et al. 2010). The integrated model that resulted from 132 \nthis collaborative research project is documented elsewhere (Prokopkin et al. 2010). The 133 \naim of the current paper is to compare different modelling approaches and to focus on the 134 \npotential for combining them either conceptually or technically. 135 \n 6 \nIn the first part of the paper a wide range of modelling approaches is presented, each 136 \nexemplified by \u2013 rather arbitrarily selected \u2013 existing models. The purpose of this first section 137 \nis to provide the reader with ideas for potential approaches in lake ecosystem modelling, 138 \nsome of which, we believe, might otherwise be overlooked. In the second part of this paper, 139 \nwe focus on the multi-decadal development and application of a specific lake ecosystem 140 \nmodel, PCLake. The aim of this section is to show the potential for expanding and 141 \nredirecting the approach taken in an existing model. In the final section the barriers and 142 \nopportunities to integrating lake modelling tools and approaches are discussed, with 143 \nrecommendations for future development directions. 144 \n 145 \nLake ecosystem modelling approaches 146 \nThe modelling of lake eutrophication started with empirical models relating total phosphorus 147 \n(TP) and chlorophyll concentrations, and input-output models relating TP loading and TP 148 \nconcentration (see e.g. Reckhow and Chapra (1983) and Harper (1992) for overviews). 149 \nBecause of the limitations of static equilibrium models, for instance to predict response times 150 \nto management measures and to account for the role of sediments and, later, also food web 151 \neffects, dynamic models for TP and chlorophyll were developed (see overviews by Chapra 152 \nand Reckhow (1983), J\u00f8rgensen et al. (1995), J\u00f8rgensen and Bendoricchio (2001), 153 \namong others). These differ widely in both functional (what compartments are included) and 154 \nhydrodynamic and spatial aspects (such as 0-, 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional). The inclusion of food 155 \nweb components was also triggered by experiences gained from biomanipulation studies 156 \n(Gulati et al. 1990; Benndorf 1995; Hansson et al. 1998; Drenner et al. 1999; 157 \nS\u00f8ndergaard et al. 2008). All these models were developed for phytoplankton-dominated 158 \nlakes; thus, macrophytes are lacking in many of the models, although the importance of 159 \nmacrophytes to water transparency had been acknowledged by some (e.g. Spence 1982; 160 \nChambers and Kalff 1985) and simple empirical models exist to quantify their effects 161 \n(Hamilton and Mitchell 1996, 1997). In the 1990s, increasing knowledge of the crucial role 162 \n 7 \nof submerged macrophytes and the resulting non-linear behaviour and bistability became 163 \navailable, especially in countries with many shallow eutrophic lakes, such as the Netherlands 164 \nand Denmark (e.g. Scheffer 1998; Jeppesen et al. 1998). These phenomena were studied 165 \nextensively by means of \u2017minimal dynamic models\u2018 (Scheffer 1998). Some workers included 166 \nstructural flexibility in dynamic models using optimization criteria (e.g. J\u00f8rgensen 1995, 167 \n1999; Zhang et al. 2010). Another modelling line that developed separately was that of 168 \nphysiologically structured models (Metz and Diekmann 1992; De Roos et al. 1992; De 169 \nRoos and Persson 2001) with applications to zooplankton (e.g. H\u00fclsmann et al. 2005) and 170 \nfish (e.g. Claessen et al. 2000), and super-individual models, especially for zooplankton 171 \n(e.g. Mooij et al. 2003), fish (Van Nes et al. 2002) and macrophytes (Van Nes et al 2003). 172 \nYet another development is the use of evolutionary algorithms and neural network models 173 \n(Cao et al. 2006; Chan et al. 2007; Recknagel et al. 2006) and of fuzzy logic (Ibelings 174 \n2003) in lake ecosystem models. Many of the different modelling approaches in the literature 175 \nare mentioned in two recent overviews by J\u00f8rgensen (2008, 2010). Our study, however, 176 \npoints to an even wider modeling perspective for lake ecosystems and reveals the 177 \nopportunities for applying and combining different approaches. Below we discuss each of the 178 \nfollowing approaches in some detail: static models, complex dynamic models, structurally 179 \ndynamic models, minimal dynamic models, and various individual-based models. 180 \n 181 \nStatic models 182 \nThe classical models of lake eutrophication are the empirical models relating TP and 183 \nchlorophyll (Sakamoto 1966 and Dillon and Rigler 1974 being the pioneers), and the input-184 \noutput models relating TP loading and TP concentration first derived by Vollenweider (1968, 185 \n1975) and Vollenweider and Kerekes (1982). These steady state models were the first to 186 \nuse the mass balance approach to lakes. Several modifications were made to these initial 187 \nmodels, and the parameters were estimated by regression on multi-lake data sets (e.g. 188 \nDillon and Rigler 1974; Kirchner and Dillon 1975; Jones and Bachmann 1976; Larsen 189 \nand Mercier 1976; Reckhow 1979; Canfield and Bachmann 1981; and others; see e.g. 190 \n 8 \nReckhow and Chapra (1983) and Harper (1992) for overviews). These models allow 191 \ncalculations of average nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations (and sometimes 192 \ntransparency) given P and N loading and some basic lake features, of which mean depth, 193 \nand retention time have proven to be the most important. Nutrient loading criteria, together 194 \nwith uncertainty bounds (Reckhow and Chapra 1983), were derived for the classification of 195 \nlakes in different trophic states (ultra-oligotrophic, oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic or 196 \nhypertrophic). These states could be defined both in terms of TP, TN and chlorophyll 197 \nconcentrations or transparency and also in terms of characteristic species composition. This 198 \ntype of model is still useful (and is being used) for giving a first estimate of the effects of 199 \neutrophication on lakes. Other simple regression models include relationship between TP, 200 \nTN and\/or lake depth versus, respectively, bird numbers and richness (Hoyer and Canfield 201 \n1994), fish biomass and\/or production (Hanson and Leggett 1982; Downing et al. 1990; 202 \nRandall et al. 1995; Bachmann et al. 1996), zoobenthos biomass (Hanson and Peters 203 \n1984), macrophyte coverage and plant volume present (Bachmann et al. 2002; 204 \nS\u00f8ndergaard et al. 2010), zooplankton biomass (Hanson and Peters 1984; Jeppesen et 205 \nal. 1997, 2005), zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio (Jeppesen et al. 2005) and 206 \nphytoplankton biovolume at the class level (Downing et al. 2001; Jeppesen et al. 2005; 207 \nH\u00e5kanson et al. 2007) and bacterioplankton biomass and production (Hardy et al. 1986; 208 \nRoland et al. 2010). Some empirical models have linked measures of biodiversity (e.g., 209 \nspecies richness or richness of native species) in lakes to external factors (e.g. Leibold 210 \n1999; Jeppesen et al. 2000; Alkemade et al. in press). 211 \nThe advantages of these models are that they are simple and easy to use, they 212 \nprovide general relationships, they are based on a large amount of data from lakes with 213 \ndifferent trophic states and they implicitly account for the net effect of structural changes 214 \nalong the nutrient gradient, which are often difficult to include in more complex dynamic 215 \nmodels. These simple regression models have, therefore, been extensively used by water 216 \nquality managers world-wide for setting targets for acceptable nutrients and, not least, TP 217 \n 9 \nloading to lakes. Their disadvantage is that the coefficient of variation in the predictions is 218 \ngenerally high and individual lakes may follow trajectories deviating from the general pattern. 219 \n 220 \nComplex dynamic models (examples given in alphabetical order) 221 \nCAEDYM 222 \nThe Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model (CAEDYM) is a process-based 223 \nlibrary of water quality, biological and geochemical sub-models that is driven by either the 224 \nDynamic Reservoir Simulation Model (DYRESM: 1D Lagrangian vertical stratification model) 225 \nor the Estuary and Lake Computer Model (ELCOM: 3D structured grid hydrodynamics 226 \nmodel) to account for transport and mixing. Both DYRESM and ELCOM have been applied 227 \nwidely to investigate stratification in lakes and drinking water reservoirs and inflow\/outflow 228 \ndynamics of the waterbodies (Robson and Hamilton 2003; Hamilton 1999). The most 229 \nrecent version of CAEDYM (v3.3, Hipsey and Hamilton 2008) can also model suspended 230 \nsolids, oxygen and organic and inorganic nutrients (C, N, P and Si), multiple phytoplankton 231 \nfunctional groups, zooplankton and fish, benthic biological communities (macroalgae, 232 \nmacrophytes and benthic invertebrates), pathogens, geochemistry (including ions, pH, redox 233 \nand metals), and sediment oxygen, nutrient and metal fluxes. These are represented by a 234 \nlong series of mass-conservative coupled differential equations, but the ecosystem 235 \nrepresentation is configurable and can be varied by the user depending on the purpose of 236 \nthe model and the availability of data. For long-term simulations DYRESM-CAEDYM has 237 \nbeen widely used (e.g., Bruce et al. 2006; Burger et al. 2007; Trolle et al. 2008a, b; Gal et 238 \nal. 2009), but when higher spatial resolution is required due to the importance of more 239 \ncomplex horizontal circulation and transport processes, ELCOM-CAEDYM is more suitable 240 \n(Hipsey et al. 2008; Chung et al. 2009; Leon et al. in press). CAEDYM has been used 241 \nwidely for studying nutrient cycling, the effects of increased nutrient loading on algal blooms 242 \nand changes to phytoplankton succession, as well as for identifying conditions that favour 243 \ncyanobacteria (Wallace and Hamilton 2000; Lewis et al. 2004). CAEDYM is also able to 244 \nresolve bacteria as a discrete ecosystem component and this has been shown to be 245 \n 10 \nimportant to represent the dynamics of micro-grazers and the 'microbial loop' (Gal et al. 246 \n2009).  247 \n 248 \nCE-QUAL-W2 249 \nCE-QUAL-W2 is a two-dimensional laterally-averaged hydrodynamic and water quality 250 \nmodel that simulates vertical stratification and longitudinal variability in key ecosystem 251 \nproperties. The current model (v3.6, Cole and Wells 2008) can simulate suspended solids, 252 \nnutrient and organic matter groups, residence time, derived variables such as TN, TKN, 253 \nTOC, Chl a, as well as pH, total dissolved gases and optional biotic groups, including 254 \nmultiple periphyton, multiple phytoplankton, multiple zooplankton, and multiple macrophyte 255 \ngroups interacting with hydrodynamics (Berger and Wells 2008). The model includes 256 \nvarious vertical turbulence closure, weirs\/spillways, gates, pipes, and pumps and reaeration 257 \nschemes for engineered systems, which can be simulated depending on the nature of the 258 \nwater body. The model is an open-source code written in FORTRAN. It has been used 259 \nextensively throughout the US (e.g., Deliman and Gerald 2002; Bowen and Hieronymous 260 \n2003; Debele et al. 2006) and elsewhere in the world (e.g., Chung and Oh 2006; Kuo et al. 261 \n2006, 2007) as a management and research tool, particularly for studying the nutrient and 262 \nsediment dynamics of reservoirs and river impoundments. The model has also been used to 263 \ndrive models of food web dynamics (Saito et al. 2001), and to support studies of fish habitat 264 \n(Sullivan et al. 2003). Despite the model\u2018s complexity, it has also been subject to advanced 265 \ncalibration procedures (Ostfeld and Salomons 2005). 266 \n 267 \nDelft 3D-Eco 268 \nDelft3D is a 2D\/3D modular modelling system to investigate hydrodynamics, sediment 269 \ntransport, morphology and water quality for lake, fluvial, estuarine and coastal environments. 270 \nThe FLOW module is the heart of Delft3D and is a multi-dimensional (2D or 3D) 271 \nhydrodynamic model that calculates non-steady flows and transports resulting from tidal and 272 \nmeteorological forcing on a curvilinear, boundary-fitted grid. This allows one to align the 273 \n 11 \ngrids with curving boundaries and channels and to concentrate the higher resolution in areas 274 \nof interest. The sediment module Delft3D-SED simulates the inorganic sediment behaviour 275 \nin the water and at the bed (transport, sedimentation, resuspension) as a function of 276 \ndischarges, sediment characteristics and waves, and is widely applied to simulate 277 \nsuspended matter in shallow lakes. The ecological module (Delft3D-ECO) is always applied 278 \nin conjunction with the water quality module (Delft3D-WAQ). Included in Delft3D-ECO are 279 \nphysical, biological and\/or chemical reactions. These processes are related to algae growth 280 \nand mortality, mineralization of organic matter, nutrient uptake and release, and oxygen 281 \nproduction and consumption. The Delft3D-ECO modelling instrument considers three 282 \nnutrient cycles: nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon. The carbon cycle is partially modelled, with 283 \na mass-balance of all components containing organic carbon. Phytoplankton kinetics are 284 \nsimulated by the model BLOOM, which is based on a competition principle using the ratio 285 \nbetween the actual growth rates and the resource requirements (Los, 2009). The model 286 \nmaximises the net production of the phytoplankton community in a certain time period 287 \nconsistent with the environmental conditions and existing biomass levels by use of an 288 \noptimisation technique called linear programming. Algal diversity in freshwater applications is 289 \nrepresented in three species groups: diatoms, flagellates and green algae and three genera 290 \nof cyanobacteria: Microcystis, Aphanizomenon and Planktothrix. To model variable 291 \nstoichiometry, each group is represented by three types defined by physiological state of the 292 \nphytoplankton: phosphorus-, nitrogen- or light-limitated. The model can easily be extended 293 \nto extra groups\/species of phytoplankton or freshwater or marine macro algae using 294 \ncharacteristics stored in a large data base. Different formulations are available for 295 \ncharacterisation of grazers, microphytobenthos, bottom sediment and sediment-water 296 \nexchange. The most comprehensive description of the model and notes on the historical 297 \ndevelopment of Delft 3D-Eco and some of its forerunners can be found in Los (2009, 298 \nchapter 7). 299 \n 300 \nEcopath with Ecosim 301 \n 12 \nECOPATH (Christensen and Pauly 1993) is an ecosystem mass-balance model for 302 \ncreating static snapshots of food webs, where functional groups are represented as 303 \nbiomasses, linked through their trophic interactions. The model establishes mass-balances 304 \nby solving sets of linear equations that describe the production and consumption of each 305 \ngroup. ECOPATH has reasonably low data requirements, and single mass balances give 306 \nvaluable insights to how energy is transferred through a system. Multiple balances are used 307 \nfor temporal or spatial comparisons of system functioning. The time-dynamic module 308 \nECOSIM (e.g. Li et al. 2010) applies differential equations to describe temporal variations of 309 \nthe flows identified by ECOPATH mass-balances and is mostly used to study effects of 310 \nfisheries\u2018 management policies in both marine and freshwater systems. ECOPATH is 311 \nespecially useful during the initial stages of investigations on a specific lake ecosystem 312 \nbecause setting up and balancing models can unveil inconsistencies in source-data and 313 \ninspire the development of hypotheses for further research. 314 \n 315 \nLakeMab 316 \nProcess-based models like LakeMab quantify fundamental transport processes in lakes, 317 \nsuch as inflow, outflow, sedimentation, resuspension, diffusion, biouptake and retention in 318 \ndifferent types of biota, mixing, substrate decomposition, etc. The basic aim of this modelling 319 \nis to find general functions for these transport processes that may be applied for all or, at 320 \nleast, most types of lakes, coastal systems and for most types of substances with a 321 \nparticulate phase. LakeMab has been tested for phosphorus, suspended particulate matter 322 \n(H\u00e5kanson 2006), radionuclides and metals (see H\u00e5kanson 2000). 323 \n 324 \nLakeWeb 325 \nLake Web is a general model to quantify lake foodweb interactions, including biotic\/abiotic 326 \nfeedbacks (H\u00e5kanson and Boulion 2002). The model has been tested against empirical 327 \ndata sets, mainly from Europe. It includes the following functional groups of organisms: 328 \nphytoplankton, bacterioplankton, benthic algae, macrophytes, zoobenthos, herbivorous and 329 \n 13 \npredatory zooplankton, prey fish and predatory fish. It uses ordinary differential equations 330 \nand gives weekly variations in production and biomass for nine groups of organisms. 331 \nFundamental concepts include consumption rates, metabolic efficiency ratios, distribution 332 \ncoefficients, migration of fish and predation pressure. An important feature of LakeWeb is 333 \nthat it can be run by just a few driving variables readily accessible from standard maps and 334 \nmonitoring programs. Several scenarios for management issues such as the consequences 335 \nof biomanipulation, changes in land-use, eutrophication, acidification and global temperature 336 \nchanges are available. LakeWeb can simulate such measures and predict the positive and 337 \nnegative consequences of remedial measures. The present version of LakeWeb has been 338 \ntested for lakes smaller than 300 km2, but many of the structural components should be valid 339 \nalso for larger systems, e.g., for coastal areas or the large lakes of the world. 340 \n 341 \nMyLake 342 \nMyLake (MultiYear Lake) is a 1-dimensional lake model code that simulates daily changes in 343 \nphysical and chemical dynamics over the depth gradient, including surface radiation 344 \nbalance, vertical light attenuation,vertical temperature and density profiles, ice and snow 345 \ncover, and phosphorus exchange between suspended particles and water, as well as 346 \nbetween water and sediment (Saloranta and Andersen 2007). The modelling principle is 347 \nmostly based on MINLAKE (Riley and Stefan 1988) with some adjustments and additions. 348 \nIn particular, incorporation of ice and snow dynamics based on physical processes 349 \n(Lepp\u00e4ranta 1993; Saloranta 2000; Salonen et al. 2009) gives the model code additional 350 \nutility for boreal lakes. MyLake has been applied to lakes in Norway (Lydersen et al. 2003; 351 \nSaloranta 2006) and Finland (Kankaala et al. 2006; Saloranta et al. 2009). 352 \n 353 \nPCLake 354 \nPCLake is an integrated ecological model of shallow non-stratifying lakes, describing 355 \nphytoplankton, macrophytes and a simplified food web, within the framework of closed nutrient 356 \ncycles. Its aim is to analyze the probability of a transition from the vegetation-dominated clear-357 \n 14 \nwater state to the phytoplankton-dominated turbid state, or vice versa, as a function of the 358 \nexternal nutrient loading and other factors. Both bottom-up, top-down and indirect effects are 359 \nincluded. PCLake has been designed to simulate the main nutrient and food web dynamics 360 \nof a non-stratifying lake in response to eutrophication and related restoration measures 361 \n(Janse et al. 1992, 1995, 2008, 2010; Janse and Van Liere 1995; Janse 1997, 2005). The 362 \nmodel describes a completely mixed water body and comprises both the water column and 363 \nthe sediment top layer (10 cm), with the most important biotic and abiotic components (Fig. 364 \n1). The upper sediment layer is included, to take into account sediment-water exchange and 365 \ndeposition history. Optionally, a wetland zone with helophytes can be added (Fig. 2). No 366 \nfurther horizontal (like depth variations) or vertical distinction within the lake is taken into 367 \naccount. Mathematically, the model is composed of a number of coupled differential 368 \nequations, one for each state variable. All biota are modelled as functional groups. The main 369 \ngroups in the water phase are three groups of phytoplankton (diatoms, greens and 370 \ncyanobacteria), zooplankton, planktivorous, benthivorous and piscivorous fish. Submerged 371 \nmacrophytes are included, consisting of a shoot and a root fraction. Further groups in the top 372 \nlayer of the sediment are the settled fractions of the three types of phytoplankton, as well as 373 \nzoobenthos.  374 \nClosed mass balances throughout the model system were attained by modelling each 375 \ncompartment in three components, namely, dry weight as a surrogate for carbon, nitrogen and 376 \nphosphorus. Additionally, diatoms and detritus are described in silicon (Si). Inorganic carbon 377 \n(CO2) is not explicitly modelled. Oxygen in the water column is modelled dynamically, while 378 \nsediment oxygen is described by a simpler approach that still accounts for oxygen influence on 379 \nnutrient release. The nutrient-to-dry weight ratios are thus variable. As the stoichiometry of 380 \norganisms changes with trophic level, mechanisms are included to allow for those differences, 381 \nsuch as a higher assimilation efficiency for nitrogen and phosphorus than for carbon. Apart 382 \nfrom mass fluxes, the model also contains some empirical relationships to represent indirect 383 \neffects between two groups of organisms, such as the impacts of fish and macrophytes on 384 \nresuspension. For a detailed description of all processes see Janse (2005). The model has 385 \n 15 \nbeen used to estimate the critical nutrient loading levels for both forward and backward 386 \nswitch between the clear and the turbid state of shallow lakes, and to identify the key 387 \nprocesses determining the switch and the way these levels depend on lake features and 388 \nmanagement factors (Janse et al., 2008). In the second part of this paper we will look at 389 \nPCLake in more detail. 390 \n 391 \nPROTECH 392 \nPROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental Change) simulates the dynamic 393 \nresponses of up to 10 species of phytoplankton (from a library of over 100) to environmental 394 \nvariability in lakes and reservoirs. The model calculates exponents describing growth and 395 \nloss processes (mortality, sedimentation, consumption by grazing zooplankton), on the basis 396 \nof the maximum growth rates of algal species in culture. A key characteristic of PROTECH is 397 \nthe use of morphological traits of phytoplankton, which enable the key physiological 398 \nparameters (growth rates etc) to be parameterized according to defined threshold levels of 399 \nlight, temperature and nutrients. The model was been extensively applied as evident from 400 \nover 30 peer-reviewed publications (see Elliott et al. 2010 for a review). Its formulation and 401 \nequations are presented in Reynolds et al. (2001). 402 \n 403 \nSALMO 404 \nSALMO (Simulation of an Analytical Lake Model, Benndorf and Recknagel 1982) is 405 \nintended to simulate the most important planktonic food-web compartments of lakes and 406 \nreservoirs. The original version and the \u201cbasic version\u201d SALMO-II consist of two layers 407 \n(epilimnion and hypolimnion) with variable mixing depth. In comparison to other models the 408 \nequations and parameters of SALMO are intended to be rather general, so that site-specific 409 \ncalibration can be avoided or at least limited to few site-specific parameters only (e.g. light 410 \nextinction, sediment P-release, fish stock). If horizontal exchange rates are available (e.g. 411 \nfrom a hydrodynamic 3D model) multiple horizontal compartments can be combined. The 412 \nrecent version SALMO-HR is a vertically resolved 1D hydrophysical-ecological coupled 413 \n 16 \nmodel, which consists of the ecological sub-model SALMO-1D (Rolinski et al. 2005, 414 \nPetzoldt et al. 2005, Baumert et al. 2005) and the hydrophysical k-\u03b5-model LAKE 415 \n(Baumert et al. 2005). It simulates the seasonal development of temperature, stratification 416 \nand turbulence (physical components) as well as the concentrations of phosphorus, 417 \nnitrogen, phytoplankton (three or more functional groups), zooplankton, oxygen, DOC (with a 418 \nfocus on humic substances) and suspended matter (4 particle classes). The model is used 419 \nfor scenario analysis (e.g. Petzoldt and Uhlmann 2006), in decision making and as a 420 \nresearch tool. 421 \n 422 \nStructurally dynamic models 423 \nAs stated in Zhang et al. (2010): \u2015In structurally dynamic models, the parameters are 424 \nconstantly varied to account for adaptations and shifts in the species composition. Changes 425 \nin the parameters are based on either expert knowledge or optimization of a goal function 426 \nthat can describe the fitness under changing environmental conditions. This approach 427 \nattempts to overcome the weaknesses associated with traditionally used models: (1) Fixed 428 \nand rigid parameter sets are used in such models, which can hardly reflect the changes in 429 \nspecies properties and compositions according to the prevailing conditions of the ecosystem 430 \nand (2) calibration is often difficult, because we have to deal with a number of uncertain 431 \nparameters simultaneously and test them within a wide range of possible values.\u2016 A 432 \ncomparable approach using \u2015dimensionless moderators\u2016 was proposed by H\u00e5kanson and 433 \nPeters (1995). 434 \n 435 \nMinimal dynamic models 436 \nLike the static models minimal dynamic models are very simple. The difference with static 437 \nmodels is that they describe changes through time and consist of a few differential or 438 \ndifference equations that focus on a single aspect of a system, based on clear assumptions 439 \n(Van Nes and Scheffer 2004). These kind of models are also called \u2017strategic\u2018 (Levins 440 \n1966) or sometimes \u2017conceptual\u2018 (Grimm 1994). 441 \n 17 \nSimple models often generate a hypothesis about a possible cause of a phenomenon 442 \nthat would not easily be achieved intuitively (Scheffer and Beets 1994). These models are 443 \nmore popular among fundamental scientists than lake managers, as they aim more at 444 \ndevelopment of theory and understanding of complex lake systems rather than making 445 \nrealistic predictions. Even if the results are unrealistic we can still learn much from these 446 \nmodels, as they may point to other mechanisms that are essential but lacking in the simple 447 \nmodel. These models have the advantage that their behaviour can usually be explored 448 \ncompletely with well-tested software tools for bifurcation analysis (Kuznetsov 1995). A 449 \nsubset of the simplest minimal models can even be analyzed mathematically. The main 450 \ndisadvantage is that minimal models obviously focus on only one aspect of the ecosystem, 451 \nwhile in reality the underlying causation may be much more complex (Scheffer and Beets 452 \n1994). Furthermore, these approaches may set artificial constraints to the level of 453 \nabstraction, not dictated by nature but by the available mathematical analysis tools. Minimal 454 \ndynamic models have been developed to study non-linear dynamics between predator and 455 \nprey (e.g. Scheffer et al. 1997) but also to study spatial pattern formation in predator-prey 456 \ninteractions (e.g. De Roos et al. 1991). 457 \nWhile being a conceptual instead of a dynamic model, PEG (Plankton Ecology 458 \nGroup) model (Sommer et al. 1986) of seasonal planktonic succession in temperate lakes 459 \ncan be considered to be a minimal model. The strong impact of this model (measured by the 460 \nnumerous times it is cited) shows the potential of minimal models to provide conceptual 461 \ninsights into lake ecosystem dynamics. Subsequently, minimal dynamic models of seasonal 462 \nsuccession have been developed (Scheffer et al. 1997) and these now also have been 463 \nused for evaluating the impact of climate change on lake ecosystems (e.g. Scheffer et al. 464 \n2001a; Van Donk et al. 2003; De Senerpont Domis et al. 2007). It is important to notice 465 \nthat these models, due to being simple, can only give conceptual answers and should be 466 \nused with great caution, e.g. when predicting the effects of climate change (Jeppesen et al. 467 \n2003). 468 \n 469 \n 18 \nIndividual-based models 470 \nIn many ecological systems knowlegde of the variation in size of individuals is essential 471 \n(Huston et al. 1988), for instance in fish populations where size is essential for survival 472 \n(Mooij 1996) and also for macrophyte populations that compete for light based on their 473 \nelevation in the water column. To model such populations accurately we need to consider 474 \nindividual traits or even individuals separately. This individual-based approach has become 475 \npopular among ecologists, as it may produce realistic patterns (for instance length 476 \ndistributions of fish) that can be checked with field data (Grimm et al. 2005). As far as we 477 \nknow, it has not yet been applied in full-scale ecosystem models. Instead, individual-based 478 \nmodels usually focus on a few ecological groups. For modelling large populations in lakes, it 479 \nis generally too computationally demanding to model all individuals separately (individual-480 \nbased model sensu stricto). Three computationally more efficient approaches are presented 481 \nbelow, the super-individual approach (Scheffer et al. 1995), physiologically structured 482 \nmodels (De Roos et al. 1992) and stage-structured biomass models (De Roos et al. 2008). 483 \nThe latter approach could equally well be categorized as a minimal dynamic model and 484 \nprovides a nice bridge between individual-based approaches and simple, unstructured 485 \nmodels of consumer-resource interactions in aquatic systems. Trait-based models may be 486 \nregarded as a subset of individual-based models. Here, the average value of traits vital to 487 \nthe functioning of the food web (e.g. body size, edibility, selectivity, or carbon to nutrient 488 \nratios) is modelled dynamically, using either ordinary or partial differential equations. 489 \n 490 \nSuper-individual models 491 \nThe super-individual approach starts with developing an individual-based model, in which 492 \nindividuals are modelled separately. These individuals differ in their characteristics (e.g. size, 493 \nweight, age). In the super-individual approach each individual has an extra property, namely 494 \nthe number of individuals that it represents. Mortality can modelled as drawing from binomial 495 \ndistributions. It can easily be used in combination with a discrete event queue, which is 496 \nsometimes used in individual-based models (Scheffer et al. 1995). This approach is closely 497 \n 19 \nrelated to that of physiologically structured models, but the implementation differs and it is 498 \neasier to scale down to a truly individual-based approach when modelling small populations 499 \n(Scheffer et al. 1995). 500 \nThe approach has been applied to the macrophyte model Charisma (Van Nes et al. 2003) 501 \nand the fish model Piscator (Van Nes et al. 2002). In both models competition between 502 \nmany species can be modelled. Charisma describes the seasonal cycle of macrophytes in 503 \ntemperate regions. Moreover, it is (optionally) spatially explicit. It is especially detailed in the 504 \ndescription of photosynthesis, and can model self-shading and shading among different 505 \nspecies. The model can have alternative stable states for different reasons (Van Nes et al. 506 \n2003). A truly individual-based version has been employed to describe in detail clonal growth 507 \nof Potamogeton perfoliatus in a very detailed way (Wolfer et al. 2006). 508 \nPiscator has, as a default, eight interacting fish species, three types of fishery (fykes, 509 \nseine and gill nets), piscivorous birds and a simple representation of the fish food 510 \n(zooplankton, benthos), but one can add as many user-defined species as required. The 511 \nmodel can include size differences among year-classes by defining different super-512 \nindividuals with slightly different growth rates. Feeding is modelled in an especially detailed 513 \nway. Special attention has been paid to controlling complexity of the model. Therefore the 514 \nmodel is very flexible and it is possible to zoom in or out on different processes by removing 515 \nspecies without changing the computer code. Furthermore an option has been implemented 516 \nto shut down feedback mechanisms between predators and prey. This way the complexity 517 \ncan be increased gradually, which makes calibration easier (Van Nes et al. 2002), though 518 \ncaution should still be excercised in the knowledge that parameter values may change with 519 \nthe inclusion of different state variables.  520 \n 521 \nPhysiologically structured models 522 \nAs stated in De Roos and Persson (2001): \u2015Physiologically structured population models 523 \noffer a concise framework to explicitly and mechanistically relate population-level 524 \nphenomena to individual-level processes, in cases where the former are significantly 525 \n 20 \ninfluenced by physiological (e.g. size) differences among individuals. Central to PSPMs is 526 \nthe clear distinction between the individual and its environment and the strict separation of 527 \nthe individual and population level. The model formulation process consists of the derivation 528 \nof a mathematical description of how individual performance (growth, survival, reproduction) 529 \nrelates to the physiological characteristics of the individual and the condition of its 530 \nenvironment. Hence, all assumptions about and parameterisation of these functional 531 \nrelationships in response to its current environment take place exclusively at the level of a 532 \nsingle individual organism. The derivation of the population model is subsequently only a 533 \nmatter of book-keeping without making any further assumptions.\u2016 While accounting for age 534 \nor size (known to be of paramount importance for physiological processes) in physiologically 535 \nstructured models as a major distinction to unstructured models, the fact that dynamic 536 \nenergy budgets (Kooijman 2000, Baird & Suthers, 2007) are obeyed implies that all traits 537 \nare linked. Thus all individuals of the same size or age are assumed to be identical. On the 538 \none hand this keeps the model mathematically tractable and allows, e.g., the quantification 539 \nof trade-offs (Rinke et al. 2008), while on the other hand the linkage of traits makes these 540 \nmodels less suited for including genotypic or phenotypic plasticity as in truly individual-based 541 \napproaches. 542 \n 543 \nStage-structured models 544 \nAs stated in De Roos et al. (2008) \u2015the model, which we refer to as the stage-structured 545 \nbiomass model, is formulated in terms of a set of ordinary differential equations. 546 \nNonetheless, under equilibrium conditions the model predictions are identical to those of a 547 \nphysiologically structured population models accounting for a continuous size-distribution, 548 \nfrom which the stage-structured biomass model is derived. Under these conditions the model 549 \ntherefore consistently translates individual life history processes, in particular food-550 \ndependent growth in body size, to the population level.\u2016 An advantage of stage-structured 551 \nbiomass models over physiologically structured models is their mathematical tractability. 552 \n 553 \n 21 \nTrait-based models 554 \nThe high diversity encountered at different hierarchical scales enables ecological systems to 555 \nadapt to the prevailing conditions (e.g., by shifts in functional types, species, clones and 556 \ngenotypes), which often also buffers their responses to perturbations (Gunderson 2000). 557 \nAllowing for such potential to adapt, strongly alters the dynamic behaviour of lab food webs 558 \nand their model representations (Yoshida et al. 2007). Hence, neglecting the naturally 559 \nexisting functional diversity and potential to adapt in lake models, may strongly reduce their 560 \nrealism and predictive power. One approach to consider this potential for adaptation in 561 \nmathematical models is to split up one or more functional group into several subunits which 562 \ndiffer in their parametrization (e.g. Vos et al. 2002; Tirok and Gaedke 2010). The choice of 563 \nparameters may follow trade-offs between the different functional traits the importance of 564 \nwhich becomes increasingly recognized (Litchman et al. 2007). This reduces, but does not 565 \nalltogether avoid, the increase in the number of free parameters. 566 \nAlternatively, the number of functional groups can be kept small when their 567 \nparameterization varies in time depending on ambient conditions. Such trait-based modelling 568 \napproaches depict species (or functional groups, clones, genotypes, etc.) or sizes by their 569 \nfunctional traits and the corresponding trait values (e.g. Wirtz and Eckhardt 1996; Norberg 570 \n2004; Savage et al. 2007; Harris 2006; Baird and Suthers 2007). A continuous trait value 571 \ndistribution describes the relative importance of the functionally different units, where the 572 \nmean trait value reflects the strategy of the most abundant units and the variance the 573 \nfunctional diversity. The trait value distribution may continuously change when growth 574 \nconditions are altered, which reflects an increase in the share of species better suited for the 575 \ncurrent environment (Wirtz and Eckhardt 1996; Merico et al. 2009). Adaptive dynamics 576 \nhave been employed to study predator-prey coevolution (e.g., Abrams and Matsuda 1997) 577 \nand increasingly also community dynamics and their potential to adapt to environmental 578 \nchanges (Norberg 2004; Savage et al. 2007). The multi-species and dynamic trait approach 579 \ngive similar results when based on comparable assumptions (Merico et al. 2009).  580 \n 22 \nSo far, models describing the ability of community dynamics to adapt have been 581 \nrestricted to one trophic level (mostly primary producers, e.g., Wirtz and Eckhardt 1996; 582 \nNorberg 2004) or at most two trophic levels (Abrams and Matsuda 1997; Tirok and 583 \nGaedke 2010). An extension to complex multitrophic level food webs represents a future 584 \nchallenge, given the rise in model complexity and the uncertainties in the trade-off functions. 585 \nA coarse, non-mechanistic but simple approach potentially suitable for complex food web 586 \nmodels may be to extend the functional response using a term for predator interference 587 \nwhich might mimic, e.g., increasing prey defence at high predator densities. 588 \n 589 \nUse of hybrid evolutionary algorithms, neural networks 590 \nThe hybrid evolutionary algorithm (Cao et al. 2006) was designed to uncover predictive rules 591 \nin ecological time-series data. It combines genetic programming to generate and optimise 592 \nthe structure of rules,and genetic algorithms to optimise parameters of rules (e.g. Recknagel 593 \net al. 2006). Resulting rules are subsequently evaluated by means of fitness criteria, where 594 \nfitter rules are selected for recombination to create the next generation by using genetic 595 \noperators such as crossover and mutation. These steps are iterated over consecutive 596 \ngenerations until the termination criterion of the run has been satisfied and the fittest rule has 597 \nbeen determined. A detailed description of the design and functioning of HEA, including a 598 \ndemo software version, are provided by Cao et al. (2006).To determine generic rule-based 599 \nagents for each lake category HEA is imbedded in a k-fold cross-validation framework 600 \n(Kohavi 1995) based on k-fold data partitioning and the consecutive use of each part of the 601 \ndata for both training and validation. This method has, for example, been used for a number 602 \nof lakes, resulting in rule-based agents for forecasting 5- to 7- days-ahead abundances of 603 \nMicrocystis in the shallow-polymictic and hypertrophic lakes in Japan, in warm-monomictic 604 \nand hypertrophic lakes in South Africa and abundances of Oscillatoria in two shallow lakes in 605 \nthe Netherlands (Recknagel et al. 2006). 606 \n 607 \nUse of Kalman filters and fuzzy logic 608 \n 23 \nMost of the models described here were mainly designed for seasonal applications. From a 609 \nmanagement point of view there is also a demand for (near) real time forecasting, for 610 \nexample, of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes used for recreation. The accuracy of traditional 611 \nmodels in predicting this type of event is usually not very high, however. An improvement 612 \nmay be obtained by a combination of different techniques, as was already described in the 613 \nprevious section. As an alternative, Kalman filters and fuzzy logic are also applied in real 614 \ntime forecasting systems of phytoplankton blooms. Kalman filters are applied in conjunction 615 \nwith deterministic equations to improve the accuracy of predictions based on systematic 616 \ndiscrepancies between modelled and observed conditions. They have been widely applied in 617 \npredicting storm surges, high water events or weather forecasts, which are often difficult to 618 \npredict by models that are basically designed for simulating average conditions. Examples of 619 \nexisting applications for phytoplankton predictions in marine systems are given in Allen et 620 \nal. (2003) and Mao and Lee (2009). 621 \nFuzzy logic provides another technique to improve the predictive power of 622 \ndeterministic models. In this case certain processes, which cannot be easily described by 623 \ndeterministic equations, are modelled using knowledge rules. As an example consider \u2017if the 624 \naverage wind speed is less than 4 m s-1 and the irradiance is high, then there is a high 625 \nprobability that a surface bloom of cyanobacteria is formed\u2018. The fuzzy rule-based models 626 \nare often employed to capture the approximate mode of reasoning that plays an essential 627 \nrole in dealing with uncertain and imprecise data. The fuzzy logic theory is based on an 628 \nextension of the classical meaning of the term \u2017set\u2018 and formulates specific logical and 629 \narithmetical operations for processing imprecise and uncertain information. The main 630 \napplication areas of the fuzzy set theory in ecological research are data analysis, 631 \nknowledge-based modelling and decision making (Salski and Holsten 2006). A combined 632 \napplication of fuzzy logic with the deterministic Delft3D-ECO model to describe the formation 633 \nand horizontal distribution of surface water blooms of toxic cyanobacteria is given by 634 \nIbelings et al. (2003). Laanemets et al. (2006) use fuzzy logic to predict cyanobacteria 635 \n 24 \nblooms of Nodularia in the Baltic, Blauw et al. (2010) use fuzzy logic to predict foam on 636 \nbeaches. 637 \n 638 \nPCLake as an in-depth example 639 \nIn this section, we describe in-depth, as an example, the multi-decadal development of the 640 \nmodel PCLake, and the way it has been applied and linked to different model approaches. 641 \nWe chose this model, because several of the authors are familiar with it and were engaged 642 \nin its development, and because it nicely illustrates the challenges met and the choices to be 643 \nmade when developing a model over several decades in response to changing management 644 \nquestions. Other models could have served as an example equally well.  645 \nFirst we describe the model development and applications, including uncertainty 646 \nanalysis and some comparisons with other models. Secondly, we describe a metamodel 647 \nderived from the dynamic model, and thirdly, the links that have been made with other 648 \napproaches (namely, coupling with hydrodynamic models and with empirical biodiversity 649 \nrelations). We conclude with apparent limitations of the model and ways to cope with these. 650 \n 651 \nModel development and applications 652 \nAs stated before, PCLake has been designed to simulate the limiting nutrient, phytoplankton 653 \nand food web dynamics of a non-stratifying lake in response to eutrophication and to 654 \nrestoration measures (Janse 1997, 2005). The first version (then called PCLoos) was 655 \ndeveloped within the Lake Loosdrecht Water Quality Project (WQL), a shallow peat lake in 656 \nthe Netherlands (Van Liere and Janse 1992; Janse et al. 1992). This project aimed to 657 \nelucidate the mechanisms causing the algal bloom problems in the lake and to estimate the 658 \neffects of reduction in phosphorus loading and other restoration measures such as dredging, 659 \nP fixation and biomanipulation. The model focused on phosphorus as nutrient, the three 660 \nmain algal groups present, the sediment top layer (because of the intensive exchange 661 \nbetween water and sediment in the lake) and top-down effects on the algae via zooplankton 662 \n 25 \nand fish. The choice was made to develop a model of \u2017intermediate\u2018 complexity, covering the 663 \nbroad ecological structure of the system, with limited chemical and hydrodynamical details 664 \ncompared to the existing models of the time. Variable P\/C stoichiometry throughout the 665 \nsystem was included from the start, based on field and experimental data from this and other 666 \nlakes. The model correctly simulated that the proposed P reduction measure did not stop the 667 \nalgal bloom and indicated the causes of the failure (such as decrease of the P\/C ratio) 668 \n(Gulati et al. 1991; Van Liere and Janse 1992). Scientific and management interests in the 669 \n\u2017alternative stable states\u2018 concept triggered an extension of the model (now called PCLake) 670 \nwith macrophytes, predatory fish and a nitrogen cycle, in order to cover both states of the 671 \nsystem (the current \u2017turbid\u2018 and the desired \u2017clear\u2018 state). The model proved, indeed, to be 672 \nable to produce switches between clear and turbid states, and to mimic hysteresis effects 673 \n(Janse 1997; Janse et al. 2008) and the effects of biomanipulation (Janse et al. 1995). 674 \nManagement interests also triggered the development of a wetland module allowing 675 \nsimulation of the impacts of helophytes zones for lake restoration (Janse et al. 2001; Sollie 676 \net al. 2009), hence taking into account a (limited) spatial aspect. Technically, the model was 677 \noriginally implemented in the simulation package ACSL\/Math (Aegis 2001), including a 678 \nMATLAB-like user interface apt for batch calculations. Later, a freely distributed OSIRIS 679 \n(Mooij and Boersma 1996) version was made, consisting of a C++ executable called from 680 \nan MS Excel shell.  681 \nThe model has been tested by a sensitivity analysis (by methods suited for non-linear 682 \nmodels) and a Bayesian parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis comparable to GLUE 683 \n(Janse et al. 2010). After identifying the key sensitive parameters, these were calibrated on 684 \nthe combined data on total phosphorus, chlorophyll-a, macrophyte cover and Secchi depth 685 \nin over 40 lakes. This was done by a Bayesian procedure, giving a weight to each parameter 686 \nsetting based on its likelihood (Aldenberg et al. 1995). This procedure hence aimed at an 687 \noverall best fit for the whole sample of lakes rather than an optimal fit for one lake at the 688 \nexpense of others. The weights were used for an uncertainty analysis, applied to the \u2017critical 689 \nphosphorus loading levels\u2018 calculated by the model. These are the threshold loadings where 690 \n 26 \na shallow lake will switch from the phytoplankton-dominated turbid state to the macrophytes-691 \ndominated clear-water state or vice versa. Apart from lake dimensions and loading, the 692 \nmodel was most sensitive to zooplankton growth rate, settling rates and maximum growth 693 \nrates of phytoplankton and macrophytes as process parameters. The results for the best run 694 \nshowed an acceptable agreement between model and data, i.e., that a regression of the 695 \npredicted on the observed values did not deviate significantly from the 1:1 line, and that 696 \nnearly all lakes to which the model was applied were classified well as either \u2017clear\u2018 697 \n(macrophyte-dominated) or \u2017turbid\u2018 (phytoplankton-dominated). The critical loading levels for 698 \na chosen standard lake showed about a factor two uncertainty due to the variation in the 699 \nposterior parameter distribution (Janse et al. 2010). Janse et al. (2008) calculated how the 700 \ncritical loading levels depend on water depth, lake size, retention time, proportional marsh 701 \narea and type of sediment. 702 \nPCLake has been used in several other case studies, both in static and dynamical 703 \nway, allowing water managers to evaluate both benefits and drawbacks of proposed 704 \nrestoration measures beforehand.The dynamical case studies, with detailed water and 705 \nnutrient budgets as input, include: management options for the Reeuwijk Lakes (Janse et al. 706 \n1993); different scenarios for water level fluctuations for Lake Oldambt (Witteveen+Bos 707 \n2009) and Lake Loenderveen and Terra Nova (Witteveen+Bos 2010c); the impact of a 708 \nsediment trap on water quality in Lake Loosdrecht (Witteveen+Bos 2008b), the impact of 709 \nfish and sediment removal in Bergse Plassen, the impact of different water storage 710 \nscenarios in Lake Oldambt (Witteveen+Bos 2009) and Nieuwe Driemanspolder 711 \n(Witteveen+Bos 2010a), and the impact of water flushing in Wieringen Borderlake 712 \n(Witteveen+Bos 2008a). 713 \nThe static applications of the model imply the estimation of the critical P loading of 714 \nlakes, i.e. the switchpoints between the (usually undesired) turbid state and the (usually 715 \ndesired) clear-water state. Estimation of the critical loadings of a lake is important for lake 716 \nmanagers and is part of the diagnostic framework for shallow lakes recently developed in 717 \nThe Netherlands (STOWA 2008). Depending on the difference between actual P loading 718 \n 27 \nand critical P loading, measures can be taken to 1) reduce the actual nutrient loading, 2) 719 \nincrease the critical loadings of water systems by adjusting lake characteristics or 3) change 720 \nthe ecological status directly by, for instance, fish removal (Meijer 2000). Janse (2005) and 721 \nJanse et al. (2008) calculated critical loadings for some 50 European lakes. Critical loadings 722 \nwere calculated for both existing (e.g. Lake Zuidlaren, Lake Breukeleveen) and new water 723 \nsystems (e.g. Eendragtspolder, Nieuwe Driemanspolder) to be used in management 724 \nprojects, giving insight into the robustness of the system to eutrophication. Although PCLake 725 \nis basically zero-dimensional, it has been run on a grid base. In particular, the design of new 726 \nwater systems (e.g. Wieringen Borderlake, Lake Oldambt) can be optimized by identifying 727 \nsensitive parts. A combination of a temporal, spatial and static approach was used here.  728 \nAlthough it was not intended from the beginning to model climate change effects, the 729 \nfact that the temperature dependencies of all processes are included, allowed preliminary 730 \nsimulations of the effects of temperature rise, the results being mainly in agreement with 731 \nobservations that warming will decrease the critical loading levels (Schep et al. 2007; Mooij 732 \net al. 2007). Mooij et al. (2009) showed that the PCLake results were qualitatively 733 \ncomparable with those of a minimal dynamic model. 734 \n 735 \nA metamodel of PCLake 736 \nIn order to provide water managers with an easy-to-use method to estimate the critical P 737 \nloading of their lakes, a metamodel of PCLake has been developed. This generates static 738 \nlake-specific critical P loadings without the need to dynamically run PCLake itself. The first 739 \nversion can be accessed on the Internet (Janse et al. 2006); an improved version was 740 \npublished recently by Witteveen+Bos (2010b). Input variables are initial state, water depth, 741 \nfetch, marsh area, residence time, soil type and background extinction. The range and 742 \ndistribution of each variable were derived from an analysis of Dutch lake characteristics, 743 \nresulting in a dataset with 41492 different sets of input variables. The critical nutrient 744 \nloadings is determined much more accurately than previously through 18 iterations, 745 \nrevealing approximately 105 possible model outcomes per set of variables between 0 and 10 746 \n 28 \nmg\u00b7m-2\u00b7d-1. The factor \u2015Secchi depth \/ water depth\u2016 was used as criterion for the ecological 747 \nstate of the lake (\u2017clear\u2018 or \u2017turbid\u2018), as it was very sensitive for small changes in P-loading 748 \naround the switch point. The results of all model runs were stored and analysed by different 749 \nmathematical techniques to derive the metamodel: multiple regression, regression trees, 750 \nblack box neural network and the new technique white box neural network (WBN). Each 751 \nmethod was applied separately for three soil types and two initial states, resulting in six 752 \ndifferent models for each method. The dataset was divided into two parts, in which 83% is 753 \nused for calibration and 17% for validation. The neural network methods gave the best 754 \nresults; the white box neural network (with an R2 of 0.96 and a relative error of 0.19) was 755 \nused for the metamodel because of a better interpretability. In any case, the average relative 756 \nerrors of the neural networks were smaller than the model uncertainty (assuming an average 757 \nrelative error of 0.4 in PCLake). Simplification (pruning) of the neural networks provide only 758 \nlittle extra value.  759 \nA general remark on metamodels is that their results are closely linked to the full-760 \nscale model they are derived from, implying the need for recalculating the metamodel in 761 \ncase of future changes in the latter. 762 \n 763 \nLinks with other model approaches 764 \nInterest from water managers triggered a parallel implementation as a \u2017quality module\u2018 in the 765 \n1-D or 2-D-horizontal water transport model DUFLOW (STOWA 1999; 2000). Fragoso et al. 766 \n(2009) coupled the model (partly adapted for subtropical lakes) with a 3-D hydrodynamic 767 \nmodel. Prokopkin et al. (2010) applied relevant parts of PCLake in an existing 1-D-vertical 768 \nmodel of the stratified saline Lake Shira. Furthermore, PCLake has been coupled with 769 \nempirical relations for species richness within functional groups, derived from a multi-lake 770 \ndataset (De Meester et al. 2006). The links with the IPH and Shira models are described 771 \nhere in some more detail. 772 \n 773 \nIPH-TRIM3D-PCLAKE 774 \n 29 \nIPH-TRIM3D-PCLake model is a complex ecosystem model (available to download at 775 \nwww.peld.ufrgs.br). A detailed description of the model can be found in Fragoso et al. 776 \n(2009). This model consists of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic module coupled with an 777 \necosystem module. Together the models describe the most important hydrodynamic, biotic, 778 \nand abiotic components of an aquatic ecosystem. The hydrodynamic model is based on the 779 \nNavier-Stokes equations, which describe dynamically the three-dimensional transport and 780 \nmixing of water. An efficient numerical semi-implicit Eulerian-Lagrangian finite difference 781 \nscheme was used in order to assure stability, convergence, and accuracy (Casulli and 782 \nCheng 1992; Casulli and Cattani 1994). The chemical and biological dynamics in the open 783 \nwater and in the sediment are based on PCLake, with an adaptation to subtropical lakes by 784 \nincluding omnivorous fish. The IPH-TRIM3D-PCLake ecosystem model further differs from 785 \nPCLake, as it takes into account: (a) the horizontal spatial heterogeneity in the aquatic 786 \nsystem at the cell level; and (b) stratification over the water column for several state 787 \nvariables (e.g. temperature, water density, nutrients, phytoplankton, and zooplankton). In 788 \norder to solve the advection-diffusion transport equation for each component in the water 789 \nnumerically, a flux limiting scheme was implemented that uses Roe\u2018s superbee limiter (Roe 790 \n1985) with a second-order Lax-Wendroff scheme (Hirsch 1990). Water temperature is 791 \nmodelled through a heat budget algorithm (Chapra 1997). The main inputs of the model are: 792 \nwater inflow, infiltration or seepage rate (if any), nutrient loading, particulate loading, 793 \ntemperature, light, wind, rainfall and evaporation, spatial maps (including waterbody 794 \nbathymetry, bottom and surface stress coefficient, etc.), sediment features, and initial 795 \nconditions. 796 \n 797 \nOne-dimensional vertical model of Lake Shira 798 \nA one-dimensional vertical model of Lake Shira (Prokopkin et al. 2010) was developed by 799 \napplying ideas and formulations in PCLake concerning ecosystem dynamics to a relatively 800 \nrare type of natural waterbody, namely brackish lakes. For these lakes strong stratification of 801 \nphysical-chemical and biological components is typical, together with low species diversity. 802 \n 30 \nThese features provide special conditions for ecosystem functioning and nutrient cycling. In 803 \nthis model a one-dimensional algorithm describing the hydrodynamic and thermal structure 804 \nof Lake Shira has been used (Belolipetsky et al. 2010). As the temperature stratification of 805 \nLake Shira is pronounced in summer, it is important to describe this phenomenon correctly 806 \nand use this effect everywhere in the model. The temperature regime is affected by wind-807 \ninduced mixing, solar heating and heat exchange with the atmosphere. With regard to 808 \necosystem processes, the impact of temperature was introduced when considered essential 809 \nand where data were available. Processes such as phyto- and zooplankton growth, 810 \nrespiration, sedimentation, mineralization, etc., use functions mainly derived from PCLake. 811 \nThe resulting patterns of phytoplankton, nutrients and other dynamics show qualitative and 812 \nquantitative agreement with the field observations during the summer season (Prokopkin et 813 \nal. 2010). 814 \n 815 \nLimitations of PCLake 816 \nThe main advantage of a complex model like PCLake \u2013 its integrated nature \u2013 of course also 817 \nconstitutes its main problem: the large number of process parameters, of which the ranges 818 \ncan hardly be assessed all together from one data set. Seen from this perspective, the 819 \nmodel analysis carried out by Janse et al. (2010) gives only incomplete estimates of 820 \nparameters. Nevertheless, some parameters can, and have been, reasonably well estimated 821 \nfrom experimental data. Some simplifications and\/or lumping of process formulations might 822 \nbe a promising direction. On the other hand, some factors are missing, such as the impact of 823 \nsulphate, iron and nitrate on processes that lead to internal nutrient cycling and 824 \neutrophication.  825 \nA major limitation in PCLake is the assumption of a uniform water depth, leading to 826 \nan \u2017all or nothing\u2018 response in lakes, which should show a more gradual response in reality 827 \nbecause of depth variations. This limitation can sometimes be overcome by a \u2017grid setup\u2018 828 \n(e.g. Witteveen+Bos 2008a, 2009, 2010a), but this is not generally applicable and it limits 829 \nthe use of the model for resuspension management measures. A complete 2-D or even 3-D 830 \n 31 \nimplementation is possible (see Fragoso et al. 2009), but creates, among other problems, 831 \nexcessive computational time. A (pseudo-)1- or 2-D version in the horizontal would, 832 \nhowever, increase the applicability. A 2-D implementation in the x-z-plane would allow 833 \naccounting for the movement of animal populations between different habitats (e.g. Vos et 834 \nal. 2002; Winder et al. 2004). 835 \nSome management questions ask for a further splitting of some model components 836 \nin more detailed groups, e.g. macrophytes and\/or fish species. Some model experiments 837 \nhave been done in this direction (e.g. Janse et al. 1995), such as in the related ditch model 838 \nPCDitch that includes several groups of macrophytes (Janse and Van Puijenbroek 1998; 839 \nJanse 2005). Regarding fish, an oversimplification of the fish module currently appears to 840 \nproduce incorrect results for the effects of biomanipulation. For macrophytes, the potential 841 \nimpact of species like Elodea and Ceratophyllum on internal eutrophication is 842 \nunderestimated. Finally, results with use of the marsh module are not always consistent with 843 \nexperience, because of oversimplified relations between marsh size and water level. Further 844 \nweaknesses, following from the model\u2018s initial aim and setup, are that it focuses on shallow 845 \n(non-stratified) lakes, and is restricted to temperate lakes (but see the studies by Fragoso et 846 \nal. (2009)). Not only may some of the parameters be sensitive to changes in climate, but 847 \nalso the structure of the ecosystems may change (see below). 848 \nWhile the model has a closed balance for phosphorus and nitrogen, dynamics of 849 \ninorganic carbon are not modelled. This limits linkage of PCLake with models that focus on 850 \nthe effect of atmospheric CO2 elevation on freshwater ecosystems (e.g. Schippers et al. 851 \n2004). 852 \nRegarding the technical aspects, an easy-to-use, freely available user interface, 853 \nallowing both easy \u2017hands-on\u2018 simulation and visualization for individual lakes, spatial 854 \n(network) simulations, batch simulations for sensitivity studies and calibration runs, and 855 \nflexibility in model structure, has not yet been produced. Batch analyses would benefit from a 856 \nprocedure to renew the initial conditions. 857 \n 858 \n 32 \nFuture perspectives for PCLake 859 \nThere are four types of questions that may influence the future development of PCLake. In 860 \nthe first instance, the applicability for lake managers will be improved by a closer relation 861 \nwith management options (including additional testing) and improvement of the user 862 \ninterface. The planning will be done in cooperation with Dutch water managers, with the 863 \nlimitations mentioned above in mind, and may imply adding detail or, alternatively, making 864 \nsimplifications. The spatial structure of the model (vertically and\/or horizontally) will be made 865 \nadaptable to specific needs. It might be helpful to cooperate with other models for certain 866 \naspects. 867 \nSecondly, policy makers ask for a lake model that can be used for projections on a 868 \nglobal scale, i.e., covering a wider range of lake characteristics, including size and 869 \nmorphology, climate zones and hydrological features, to be embedded in an existing global 870 \ncatchment and land use model for anthropogenic pressures (PBL 2009, Alkemade et al. 871 \n2009, in press). PCLake may be helpful, besides other model approaches, in the set-up of 872 \nsuch a model.  873 \nThirdly, the link with biodiversity modelling will be strengthened, which deserves 874 \nmuch attention both on global (MEA 2005) and regional scales. We refer to the discussion 875 \nsection for possible directions.  876 \nFinally, the PCLake model, or specific submodules or cut-outs from it, will be 877 \ncontinuously available for use in other projects, such as the application for stratified saline 878 \nlakes presented in this volume (Prokopkin et al. 2010, Degermendzy et al. 2010). 879 \n 880 \nClosing remarks on PCLake 881 \nThe long exposition of PCLake in this paper might suggest that the model and its 882 \ndevelopment did not suffer from the two wasteful trends of model development (\u2017reinventing 883 \nthe wheel\u2018 and \u2017having tunnel vision\u2018) that are central to our message. It is not our intention 884 \nto create this impression. In the Dutch setting PCLake was developed independently from 885 \nthe other major Dutch lake ecosystem model DELFT3D-ECO (and its predecessors). 886 \n 33 \nMoreover, in the development of PCLake the focus has always been on food web dynamics, 887 \nwith a more limited attention for spatial dynamics. One the positive side, and as documented 888 \nabove, PCLake has now been embedded in models focussing on spatial dynamics, and has 889 \nalso been linked with minimal dynamic models and static models. The discussion that 890 \nfollows, concerning \u2017leading principles\u2018, might shed some more light on the choices made 891 \nduring the development of PCLake and the other models mentioned in this paper. 892 \n 893 \nDiscussion 894 \nLeading principles 895 \nThe rather arbitrarily chosen sample of lake models presented above indeed shows the 896 \ndiversity of approaches to lake ecosystem modelling. Because these approaches differ in 897 \nmany respects, and overlap to various degrees, there is no single axis along which they can 898 \nbe adequately categorized. In an attempt to classify them we scored each approach using 899 \nmultiple criteria concerning model components (Table 1) and model characteristics (Table 900 \n2). But perhaps the simplest way to get an overview of the whole range of approaches, and 901 \nan appreciation of their virtues and vices, is to look at the leading principle that led to the 902 \ndevelopment of each approach.  903 \nStatic models are developed from an empirical perspective with no or limited 904 \nattention given to the underlying mechanisms. With their strong backing by data, they have 905 \nsuccessfully convinced scientists, water quality managers and politicians from the 1970s 906 \nonwards that eutrophication had a strong negative impact on aquatic ecosystems, and they 907 \nstill provide useful rules of thumb for water quality management. 908 \nAnother important approach is that of complex dynamic lake ecosystem models 909 \nbased on differential equations. Two leading principles prevail here: a focus on spatial 910 \ncomplexity and hydrology in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions and a focus on food web structure and 911 \ncomplexity. The fact that in many models one of these two important aspects of aquatic 912 \n 34 \necosystems is better developed than the other suggests a trade-off between spatial 913 \ncomplexity versus food-web complexity in model development. 914 \nWithin the category of complex dynamic models, more detailed knowledge on the 915 \nleading principles that shaped each particular model could be identified, giving a better 916 \nunderstanding of the choices and assumptions that were made during model development. 917 \nThis should enable model developers to (1) better take advantage of the already existing 918 \nprinciples and models, thus avoid \u2017reinventing the wheel\u2018, and also to (2) modify and (3) 919 \ncombine the strengths of these principles and models. We stress, at the same time, the 920 \nimportance of breaking with the undesirable fragmentation in the development of complex, 921 \ndynamic, lake ecosystem models, which currently exists within the modelling community. 922 \nWhile complex ecosystem models were considered very promising in the early 923 \n1980s, when powerful computers became widely available (Rigler and Peters 1995), they 924 \nwere heavily criticised in the 1990s for being data-hungry, overly complex, and not leading to 925 \nscientific insight or predictive power (for a critical discussion on complex dynamic models 926 \nsee also H\u00e5kanson and Peters (1995)).  927 \nOften the underlying model algorithms employ a simple \u2017engineering-based\u2018 928 \nparadigm, where small-scale ecosystem processes (e.g., algal growth, bacterial 929 \nmineralization of nutrients, etc.) are \u2017scaled-up\u2018 (Flynn, 2005). For example, fluxes of 930 \nnutrients between simulated pools are approximated using semi-empirical algorithms 931 \ndetermined in laboratory microcosms and applied within lake-scale models with little regard 932 \nof organism adaptability or more complex ecological interactions (Arhonditsis and Brett 933 \n2004). Where attempts are made to resolve the higher ecological interactions such as fish 934 \nand benthic communities within a spatially-resolved hydrodynamic model, a lack of suitable 935 \nvalidation data and excessive model complexity in the absence of guidance by sound 936 \nempirical data hinders progress and often means that trophic levels above phytoplankton 937 \ngrazers are ignored. Furthermore, while the approach of using a couple hydrodynamic-938 \necological model can improve our understanding of the physical, chemical and biological 939 \nroles influencing water quality dynamics, it generally remains unclear whether all important 940 \n 35 \necosystem feedback mechanisms are represented. These fundamental limitations can have 941 \na profound impact on their ability to predict responses to change, and whether \u2017emergent\u2018 942 \necosystem behaviours (patterns that emerge due to complex system dynamics) such as 943 \nthose observed in nature can be resolved. 944 \nThe above mentioned points of criticism of complex dynamic models stimulated the 945 \ndevelopment of minimal dynamic models. These models build on basis of the seminal work 946 \non predator-prey interactions by Rosenzweig and MacArthur (1963) and Rosenzweig 947 \n(1971) and aim at understanding non-linear processes and alternative stable states in lake 948 \necosystems (and many other dynamic systems) (e.g. Scheffer 1990; Scheffer et al. 1993, 949 \n2001b, 2007). Even though they are highly abstract and do not produce quantitative output 950 \nthat is of direct use to water quality management, they fully accomplished their goal of 951 \ngenerating general insight into large scale mechanisms and had a surprisingly strong impact 952 \non management strategies for mitigating anthropogenic stress factors such as 953 \neutrophication. 954 \nThe notion that the dynamics of higher trophic levels with their complex life-histories, 955 \nontogenetic shifts and behaviour cannot be captured in a single state variable representing 956 \ntheir carbon content alone led to the development of individual-based approaches (see 957 \nDeAngelis and Mooij 2005, for a review of individual-based models of ecological and 958 \nevolutionary processes). As explained in detail above, various \u2017schools\u2018 exist within this 959 \nbroader approach, each with their own leading principles. While models based on super-960 \nindividuals aim for including empirical realism and detail, physiologically structured and 961 \nstage-structured biomass models aim for mathematical tractability. Both allow for taking into 962 \naccount the intricate and sometimes non-intuitive effects of ontogenetic development on 963 \nfood web dynamics. Also trait-based models can be qualified as individual-based. Here the 964 \nfocus is on adaptation at various levels of integration, and its consequences for food web 965 \ndynamics. Again, these models are mostly developed within the constraints set by 966 \nmathematical tractability.  967 \n 968 \n 36 \nChallenges and opportunities: Ecological aspects 969 \nModelling the impact of climate change with eutrophication models 970 \nOne of the aims with documenting in detail the multi-decadal development of PCLake was to 971 \nshow how a model that was applied to eutrophication studies is now also applied to climate 972 \nstudies. On the positive side, the results obtained so far show that, qualitatively, model 973 \noutput for climate scenarios (Mooij et al. 2007) coincides with what we know from empirical 974 \nstudies (Mooij et al. 2005) and with general patterns obtained with minimal dynamic models 975 \n(Mooij et al. 2009). Importantly, the impacts of eutrophication and climate change are tightly 976 \nlinked and, therefore, require a model that simultaneously deals with both aspects. On the 977 \nnegative side, however, these predictions have not yet been verified in a formal comparison 978 \nof model output with the scarce field data that we have on the interplay between 979 \neutrophication and climate change (in particular climate warming, e.g. Moss et al. 2003; Van 980 \nder Bund et al. 2004; Jeppesen et al. 2009, 2010). Cross latitude studies that indicate 981 \nmajor changes in the trophic structure in lakes may challenge model performance. The 982 \ncomposition of fish stocks is expected to change towards higher dominance of 983 \nzooplanktivorous and omnivorous fish, implying increased predation on zooplankton and, 984 \nconsequently, less grazing on phytoplankton (less top-down control), and a higher 985 \nchlorophyll:TP ratio (higher yield). Moreover, in warmer lakes fish are smaller, grow faster, 986 \nmature earlier and have shorter life spans, allocate more energy to reproduction, and have a 987 \nhigher degree of omnivory than populations at higher latitudes, both between and within 988 \nspecies (Blanck and Lammouroux 2007; Jeppesen et al. 2010). While several models 989 \ninclude fish dynamically, most of the changes described above are not included, which may 990 \nlead to too conservative predictions of the effect of climate change. The direction of the 991 \ncross-latitude changes from cold to warm lakes, that in part might reflect also 992 \nbiogeographical difference and differences in lake age, are largely confirmed in time series 993 \nfrom northern temperate lakes (e.g. Jeppesen et al. 2009, 2010). 994 \nIn addition, the effects of plants on water clarity seem weaker in subtropical lakes 995 \nthan in north temperate lakes (Jeppesen et al. 2007). Hence, Bachmann et al. (2002) 996 \n 37 \nfound no differences in chlorophyll:TP or Secchi depth:TP relationships in subtropical lakes 997 \nwith low, medium-high or high plant coverage or the amount of plant volume present (% 998 \nPVI). This suggests that the refuge for zooplankton is poor in warm lakes, which is confirmed 999 \nby comparative experimental studies conducted in temperate Denmark and subtropical 1000 \nUruguay (Meerhoff et al. 2007). Moreover, a cross-system analysis of data from lakes from 1001 \nthe temperate zone to the tropics gave evidence for a lower probability of macrophyte 1002 \ndominance in warm lakes and lower nutrient thresholds for loss of these plants (Kosten et 1003 \nal. 2009). No complex models have included such effects, which apparently play an 1004 \nimportant role for changes in the function of shallow lakes ecosystems and their water clarity 1005 \nas they get warmer, although preliminary PCLake results are in agreement with this direction 1006 \n(Mooij et al. 2008). 1007 \nAnother main challenge for predicting effects of climate change is the difficulty in 1008 \naccurately predicting regional wind speed and precipitation (and thus the boundary condition 1009 \ndata that feed into the lake ecosystem models). While air temperature predictions from the 1010 \nglobal climate models are considered relatively reliable from the global climate models, 1011 \nregional wind speed and precipitation (and thus runoff) predictions are still unreliable, and 1012 \ncertain variables, such as radiation, are rarely entered as input to the models. However, 1013 \nconsiderable progress is currently being made in this field (IPCC 2007; Sipkay et al. 2009). 1014 \nSimilarly, it is highly uncertain which effects global change will have in the catchment scale, 1015 \nwhere increasing temperatures, changing land use and frequency of extreme events will 1016 \nlead to changing nutrient fluxes into the surface waters. A study on the influence of altered 1017 \nhydrological regimes brought about by shifting precipitation patterns in eastern Australia 1018 \nusing ELCOM-CAEDYM has highlighted the potential significance of this on water quality 1019 \nprocesses (Vilhena et al. 2010). 1020 \nA final point that we would like to make here is that climate studies have shown that 1021 \nin the temperate zone changing conditions in winter may be as important as, or even more 1022 \nimportant, than changing conditions in summer. For instance, warm winters may lead to 1023 \nlarger inocula of cyanobacteria and higher winter fish survival , leading to blooms and 1024 \n 38 \ndeteriorated water quality in the following summer. Also many invasive species benefit from 1025 \nwarmer winters. In addition, increasing winter temperatures in boreal regions would impact 1026 \nlake surface freezing dynamics. We feel that the issue of \u2017winter limnology\u2018 has not yet 1027 \ngained the attention it needs in the light of climate change. 1028 \nBoth from scientific and policy-oriented sides there is a great need for a lake model 1029 \nable to grasp the impact of combined anthropogenic factors (land use, climate change, 1030 \nfisheries and others) on ecosystem structure and function for a broad range of lake types. 1031 \nThe combination of dynamical models with empirical relations might be a fruitful approach. 1032 \n 1033 \nModelling biodiversity 1034 \nA certain level of biodiversity is included in models like Delft-3D Eco, DYRESM-CAEDYM 1035 \nand PCLake, but the level of detail is still far from the biodiversity that we observe in lakes. 1036 \nSeveral studies have related species richness in natural lakes with global factors such as 1037 \nlatitude, altitude, lake size and water chemistry (e.g. Amarasinghe and Welcomme 2002) 1038 \nand productivity (e.g. Leibold 1999; Jeppesen et al. 2000; Declerck et al. 2007). Many 1039 \nmodel applications rather deal with functional diversity by defining, for example, functional 1040 \nphytoplankton groups instead of using single species definitions and, therefore, do not allow 1041 \nprojections for species richness. Probably, one of the main obstacles to including more 1042 \ndetails on biodiversity in models of aquatic ecosystems is that we still lack understanding of 1043 \nthe mechanisms maintaining biodiversity. One line of research is to include variations within 1044 \nfunctional groups and study the effects on ecosystem functioning. Currently, there is an 1045 \nongoing debate about the role of niche-based versus neutral processes in maintaining 1046 \nbiodiversity and potential links between the two theories. Another line of research focuses on 1047 \ndeterministic chaos as an explanation for the observed biodiversity and strong fluctuations of 1048 \nthe dominant species within functional groups. PROTECH fits in the niche-based approach 1049 \nand seems to indicate that considerable progress can be made along this line. Structurally 1050 \ndynamic and trait-based models also aim at capturing shifts in species composition, though 1051 \nthey are still in a pre-mature stage.  1052 \n 39 \nAn alternative approach is to calculate species diversity, functional diversity and size 1053 \ndiversity from empirically based relationships using output variables (e.g. TP) from the 1054 \ncomplex ecological models. An example is the combination of empirical relations with 1055 \nPCLake output for total P, chlorophyll-a and other variables for a dataset of European lakes 1056 \n(De Meester et al., 2006). Another (maybe more policy-or conservation-driven) indicator of 1057 \nbiodiversity, as used in the GLOBIO model (PBL, 2009, Alkemade et al., in press), is 1058 \n\u2017biodiversity intactness\u2018 (Scholes and Biggs, 2005): or the (remaining) mean abundance of 1059 \nthe species that are native to the specific type of ecosystem, which has been linked to lake 1060 \nenvironmental factors such as nutrients (e.g. Alkemade et al., in press). Another possible 1061 \nlink is to add a functional-ecological index comparable to the \u2017Depletion Index\u2018 or \u2017Marine 1062 \nTrophic Index\u2018 as used in marine Ecosim models. 1063 \n 1064 \nModelling of sediment diagenesis, and coupling of diagenetic processes to water column 1065 \ndynamics 1066 \nIt is well known that the amount and availability of nutrient pools in lake sediments can 1067 \nstrongly influence the ecological dynamics of the overlying water column (S\u00f8ndergaard et 1068 \nal. 2003), and can even prevent or delay the response of lake water quality to changes in 1069 \nexternal forcing, such as changes in nutrient loading or climate (Jeppesen et al. 2005, 1070 \n2007). However, sediment nutrient cycling is often not dynamically accounted for, or only 1071 \nincluded through very simplistic representations, by lake ecosystem models, and it will be a 1072 \ngreat challenge to improve this element of the models, thus being able to dynamically 1073 \nsimulate the response (and resilience) of lake ecosystems to changes in nutrient loading 1074 \nand\/or climate, rather than to converge on a new equilibrium state.  1075 \nBoth relatively simple two-layer oxic\/anoxic sediment diagenesis models (e.g. Wang 1076 \net al. 2003a, b) and multi-layer, one-dimensional, complex diagenesis models have been 1077 \navailable for decades (e.g., J\u00f8rgensen et al. 1982; Boudreau 1996). Therefore, the most 1078 \nchallenging aspect of improving representations of sediment dynamics in lake ecosystem 1079 \nmodels is not to develop new sediment diagenesis models, but rather to obtain sediment 1080 \n 40 \nnutrient data for testing, modification, calibration and validation of already existing models, 1081 \nas these data are rarely (or never) available at appropriate spatial scales over sufficiently 1082 \nlong time periods (extending one or several decades) (e.g.,Trolle et al, 2010). 1083 \n 1084 \nModelling fisheries in an ecosystem context  1085 \nThere is an increasing trend towards modelling fisheries in an ecosystem context in 1086 \nboth marine (Hall and Mainprize 2004) and freshwater systems (Kitchell et al. 2000; 1087 \nLammens et al. 2002). In both systems, studies on the impact of bottom-up processes 1088 \nthrough the food web on fisheries have been stimulated by effective management leading to 1089 \nre-oligotrophication of systems that had become eutrophied. In such cases, it has been 1090 \nquestioned whether minimum levels of carrying capacity of the system for stocks of fish 1091 \nshould be maintained. These stocks can be of interest for a commercial fishery, for sport 1092 \nfishing, or as food for bird species that have a protected status and hence there is a demand 1093 \nfor embedding fisheries in lake ecosystem models. Ecosystem Based Fishery Management 1094 \n(EBFM; EPAP 1999) is a significant departure from traditional fisheries management. EBFM 1095 \nconsiders the impact that fishing has on all aspects of the ecosystem, not just the target 1096 \nspecies (Pikitch et al 2004). Starting from a different perspective, Makler-Pick (2010), has 1097 \ndemonstrated the utility of linking an individual-based fish population model with a complex 1098 \nhydrodynamic-food web model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) to explore the impact of fishery 1099 \nmanagement on the water quality of Lake Kinneret (Israel). The model allows the study of 1100 \nthe role of the fish in a lake ecosystem and has to potential to serve as an EBFM tool, since 1101 \nit also includes fishery mortality. 1102 \n 1103 \nChallenges and opportunities: Conceptual and technical aspects 1104 \nModel complexity 1105 \nWe take the point of view that a single \u2017right\u2018 approach or level of complexity does not exist. 1106 \nInstead, multiple modelling approaches, applied concurrently to a given problem, can help in 1107 \ndeveloping an integrated view on the functioning of lake ecosystems (Scheffer 1998, p308; 1108 \n 41 \nVan Nes and Scheffer 2004; Mooij et al. 2009). This is a shift in paradigms away from the 1109 \nhopes in the seventies and eighties of the past century that, with increasing computational 1110 \npower, a full reductionist approach to ecosystem dynamics would yield both insight and 1111 \npredictive power. In the new view, we acknowledge that each modelling approach has 1112 \nfundamental shortcomings that cannot be overcome purely through enhanced computational 1113 \npower. To give an example, recent advantages in deterministic chaos as an explanation for 1114 \nthe maintenance of planktonic biodiversity (Huisman and Weissing 1999) through \u2017super-1115 \nsaturated coexistence\u2018 (Schippers et al. 2001) could only have been made using minimal 1116 \ndynamic models. But minimal dynamic models will never to able to provide water quality 1117 \nmanagers with the input they need in the management of biodiversity.  1118 \nFrom this perspective, the recent advance in water-related cyber-infrastructure, 1119 \ndefined as the system of hardware and software components that monitor, manage and 1120 \nmodel aquatic ecosystems (Shade et al 2009), has created challenges and opportunities for 1121 \nlake modelling. For example, assimilation of observations from real-time lake sensors to 1122 \nreduce error and uncertainty in model parameterizations is emerging as a promising tool to 1123 \ndeal with this issue. For water quality or ecological applications it remains challenging. There 1124 \nare examples, however, where lake metabolism has been computed from real-time oxygen 1125 \nand temperature measurements, and then used to update the parameters of complex 1126 \nhydrodynamic-ecological models used to forecast lake conditions. 1127 \n 1128 \nMultiple-model paradigm 1129 \nA more plain approach is to accept all the virtues and shortcomings of each model and 1130 \nrespect their identities. This is analogous to approaches and themes taken by the 1131 \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their assessment of atmospheric climate 1132 \nmodels (global circulation models), where, for example, 23 climate models were applied 1133 \nindividually, and their simulations for outgoing radiation were collated to produce a range of 1134 \nsimulations (Randall et al. 2007). It was found that the simple arithmetic mean \u2017model\u2018 of all 1135 \nmodel simulations, which in itself has no ecological meaning, was the most accurate in 1136 \n 42 \npredicting outgoing radiation. Such a multiple-model study will not just provide a quick 1137 \noverview of equally valid model alternatives to potential users or lake managers, but will also 1138 \ngive insights into selection of essential model features to a particular problem for the model 1139 \ndevelopers. Whereas its benefits are obvious, adoption of this paradigm into lake ecosystem 1140 \nmodelling may of course not be straightforward, as many lakes have highly variable natural 1141 \nconditions and anthropogenic impacts, and different models may have different scopes. Also 1142 \nthe recently formed Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 1143 \n(IPBES, Larigauderie and Mooney 2010) advocates multi-model studies as a basis for 1144 \nfuture biodiversity assessments. Models for freshwater biodiversity, coupled to global 1145 \nchange and other drivers, are urgently needed to support policies at different geographical 1146 \nlevels. 1147 \n 1148 \nDirectly linking approaches 1149 \nIn specific cases, however, different approaches can be linked directly. New knowledge can 1150 \nbe discovered through tight interactions between data based and deterministic approaches - 1151 \ntop-down modelling can validate and inform bottom-up modelling, and vice versa, in a 1152 \nfeedback loop, to ultimately result in a more comprehensive understanding of lake response 1153 \nto perturbation. A good example is the derivation of static models from complex dynamic 1154 \nmodels in so-called \u2017metamodels\u2018. As documented above, such a link between dynamic and 1155 \nstatic applications has been realized for PClake. In this particular example, the purpose of 1156 \nstatic applications is to derive a system-dependent critical loading of nutrients. The purpose 1157 \nof dynamic applications is to better understand the relative importance of different 1158 \ncharacteristics to the ecological functioning of a specific lake, through which key factors can 1159 \nbe identified, and to make specific predictions of the impact of management measures on 1160 \necological functioning. 1161 \nOther possibilities for a direct link between modelling approaches are the inclusion of 1162 \nphysiologically structured or stage-structured modules for fish and zooplankton in complex 1163 \necosystem models.This usefulness of making this link was recently shown in the DYCS-1164 \n 43 \nFISH model for simulating fish populations in aquatic systems (Makler-Pick 2010) that was 1165 \nmentioned earlier. 1166 \n 1167 \nCalibration, uncertainty and error-propagation 1168 \nWhile the topics of model calibration, uncertainty and error propagation are of overwhelming 1169 \nimportance in many of the more complex modelling approaches, we will be brief here, 1170 \nespecially in the light of the many publications on this topic (see citations in Arhonditsis and 1171 \nBrett 2004; Arhonditsis et al. 2007; Janse et al. 2010). In view of our discussion on 1172 \ncomplex versus more simple models, the common notion is that a disadvantage of complex 1173 \nmodels is that they are both difficult to calibrate and \u2017data hungry\u2018. In this respect it is 1174 \nimportant to notice that the importance of a clear separation between parameters that are 1175 \nchosen a priori versus those chosen a posteriori. In a study on error propagation in spatially 1176 \nexplicit individual-based models Mooij and DeAngelis (1999, 2003) showed that in a strict 1177 \nstatistical sense complex models of which only a few parameters are estimated a posteriori 1178 \n(calibrated) have even narrower log-likelihood profiles for the estimated parameters than 1179 \nsimple models with an equal number of parameters. This gives rise to the counterintuitive 1180 \nnotion that complex, more realistic models of which only a few parameters are calibrated 1181 \nmay be less \u2017data hungry\u2018 than their simpler counterparts. Further, the procedure of 1182 \ndetermining sensitivity and uncertainty in complex models, if designed appropriately, can in 1183 \nfact be used to help extract important information about key processes (Makler-Pick in 1184 \npress). 1185 \n 1186 \nUsing optimization principles 1187 \nThere has been quite some controversy whether it is acceptable to employ some form of 1188 \noptimization principle in ecological lake models. A widely applied phytoplankton model that 1189 \nemploys such principle is BLOOM II (Los, 2009). The model is based upon a competition 1190 \nprinciple for individual ecotypes, which is translated into an equivalent optimization principle 1191 \nat the community level. First the different possible states at which one of the nutrients or light 1192 \n 44 \nlimits growth of one of the ecotypes are defined. Subsequently the general linear 1193 \nprogramming algorithm selects from those states, the one at which the potential growth rate 1194 \nof all ecotypes is maximal and the requirement for the resources is minimal. It can be shown 1195 \nanalytically that this method effectively gives equal weight to a high potential growth capacity 1196 \nas well as to a low requirements for nutrients and light in determining the algal composition 1197 \nof the system in steady state. To prevent unrealistically fast jumps towards such steady state 1198 \nsolutions when BLOOM is embedded in a dynamic model, the realized growth rate of each 1199 \nspecies is limited to that which is feasible, given temperature and light conditions. Similarly, 1200 \nthe model imposes a limit on mortality, to prevent unrealistically rapid declines.  1201 \nOptimization is also at the heart of the approach of Structurally Dynamic Models 1202 \n(H\u00e5kanson and Peters 1995; Zhang et al 2010). From a neo-Darwinian point of view, 1203 \noptimizing principles, such as maximization of exergy in SDMs, could be questioned, 1204 \nbecause these principles act at a high integration level and it is not always obvious how to 1205 \nlink these principles with individual fitness. An opportunistic argument in favour of 1206 \noptimisation would be that in practice these models do better in their confrontation with data 1207 \nthan models that lack such optimization. Whether this argument remains intact when major 1208 \nchanges in environmental pressures occur (e.g. climate change) needs to be tested. 1209 \n 1210 \nReusing existing code in other or new models 1211 \nThe core of the majority of models mentioned in this manuscript consists of differential 1212 \nequations. Insofar as these are ordinary differential equations, it is very simple to keep the 1213 \nalgorithms in which they are coded separate from other model code. The only slight 1214 \ncomplication arises when the model contains (nested) if-then-else blocks, resulting in 1215 \nmultiple definitions of the same variable (at different conditions), While this facilitates the 1216 \nreadability of the model code, it may diffuse the set of equations for a given variable and 1217 \nhamper the reusability of code in some other programming languages. From a perspective of 1218 \nreusability of code the use on conditional statements that combine all assignments for given 1219 \nvariable in one line of code might be preferred. 1220 \n 45 \nFor models built on ordinary differential equations many standard and reliable 1221 \nintegration routines are available (e.g. Press et al. 1992). However, note that complex 1222 \ndynamic models often contain processes that can have very different time scales. The 1223 \nmodels may hence be rather stiff, which makes integration not a trivial task. If in addition the 1224 \nODEs contain discontinuities (if-then statements) standard methods may rather easily 1225 \ngenerate numerical artifacts that are not obvious. 1226 \nInsofar as partial differential equations relate to spatial grids, different mathematical 1227 \nintegration routines are available, each with their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, 1228 \nthe complexity of these routines usually transcends the mathematical knowledge and skills 1229 \nof ecological modellers and demands involvement of mathematicians. While partial 1230 \ndifferential equations also are at the heart of physiologically structured models, they demand 1231 \ncompletely different implementations. Public well-documented libraries for implementing 1232 \nsuch models are now available (De Roos 2010; Soetaert et al. 2010). Such libraries 1233 \nfacilitate the reusability of model code and such an approach should be encouraged. 1234 \nIndividual-based models are often not well founded in mathematical theory and in 1235 \nparticular, deal with time in a very informal way. By this we mean that there is no clear 1236 \nseparation between the state of the system at a given moment in time, and the processes 1237 \nthat work on these states. This carries the risk that the order in which the model formulations 1238 \nare evaluated has an unknown impact on model outcome. A more formal embedding in 1239 \nmathematics should be possible because most individual-based models are in fact a very 1240 \ncomplicated set of difference equations (i.e. they consist of long lists of stepwise changes in 1241 \nmodel states). The most complicated code structure of IBMs in practice prohibits the reuse 1242 \nof code. Recent progress in formalizing the IBM approach has been made, however (Grimm 1243 \net al. 2006). 1244 \n 1245 \nThe model experimentalist 1246 \nComparing different model approaches in a systematic and scientific way constitutes an 1247 \nalmost unachievable task, as usually more than a single difference exist between two 1248 \n 46 \nmodels. It is therefore difficult to attribute emerging differences in model behavior to specific 1249 \ndifferences in the model structures. However, the standard methodology of an experimental 1250 \necologist is to never change more than one factor at the same time, and the same 1251 \nphilosophical principal should hold true for complex models. More scientific insight can be 1252 \ngained when several, competing approaches for specific processes\/submodels (e.g. 1253 \nphotosynthesis-light model, complexity of higher trophic levels) are implemented in the same 1254 \nmodel. Then the user can evaluate these submodels systematically while keeping the 1255 \nremaining model conserved and investigate their effects on the model performance.  1256 \n 1257 \nUse of object oriented programming 1258 \nObject oriented programming (OOP) is increasingly used in many major software 1259 \ndevelopment projects and some OOP frameworks can be useful in facilitating modular model 1260 \ndesign and reusability of code. Yet, its use in lake ecosystem modelling is still limited. 1261 \nThe 1D hydrodynamic model DYRESM has also been written following OOP 1262 \nprinciples, although care has to be taken for selecting an appropriate object structure for 2 or 1263 \n3D hydrodynamic models because of the computationally demanding nature of the 1264 \nnumerical solutions. Moreover, PCLake has been implemented in the object-oriented 1265 \nframework OSIRIS (Mooij and Boersma 1996), this implementation still does not take full 1266 \nadvantage of the potential of this object-oriented framework. 1267 \nIn contrast to modelling the structure of an ecosystem, Petzoldt and Rinke (2007) 1268 \nproposed a rather general object-oriented model using a state-space formulation of a 1269 \ndynamic system. Here the OOP interface represents the model together with its data while 1270 \npreserving full freedom for the core functions. The approach was designed for a convenient 1271 \nimplementation of minimal dynamic models in the R language (R Development Core Team 1272 \n2009), and it allows to establish direct communication between model and solver codes 1273 \nwritten in compiled languages (Soetaert et al, 2010) to avoid communication overhead. 1274 \nAnother development worth mentioning here is the work of Recknagel et al (2008) and Cao 1275 \net al (2008). 1276 \n 47 \nThe use of OOP within ecosystem modelling codes will ultimately support the 1277 \nportability and wider application of them with physical models of different dimensionality. As 1278 \nexemplified within this paper, depending on site geography and the scientific basis for the 1279 \nmodelling study, a number of hydrodynamic solvers are relevant even though the underlying 1280 \nbiogeochemical and ecological parameterisations are common. Standards for model 1281 \ncoupling and communication (e.g., OpenMI, www.openmi.org) and OOP code standards will 1282 \nallow transferability of model components to a wider range of applications. 1283 \n 1284 \nIntegrating individual-based models with models based on differential equations 1285 \nIt is now widely acknowledged that individual variation and behaviour cannot be ignored 1286 \nwhen looking in detail at higher trophic levels (DeAngelis and Mooij 2005). Fish populations 1287 \nare highly size-structured, while birds often perform seasonal migration. These aspects are 1288 \neasily incorporated in individual-based models. While there are no major technical obstacles 1289 \nthat prohibit the integration of physiologically structured models of fish in complex ecosystem 1290 \nmodels, we are not aware of successful attempts to do so yet. Such developments would 1291 \nalso be desirable for zooplankton, where size-structured interactions are known to be 1292 \ncritically important for the dynamics of the system (H\u00fclsmann et al. in press).  1293 \nFor models based on super-individuals, the situation is conceptually more complex 1294 \nbecause, as outlined above, these employ a fundamentally different mathematical approach, 1295 \nwhich is less suitable for integration in models that are based on unsteady differential 1296 \nequations and focus on the conservation of mass. The Lake Kinneret example by Makler-1297 \nPick (2010) however does suggest that this approach is possible and can be further 1298 \ndeveloped where field data is available. Another example is found in modelling approaches 1299 \nthat link individual-based models of fish larvae with nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton 1300 \nchains (e.g. Hermann et al. 2001). 1301 \n 1302 \nModel documentation and copyrights on source code 1303 \n 48 \nWe take the point of view that for the progress of science it is essential that the source code 1304 \nin which the mathematical formulations of the model are turned into a working model is free 1305 \nof copyrights and fully documented to the level where the model can be re-implemented on 1306 \nthe basis of the documentation, of course accompanied by a proper citation. We can 1307 \nunderstand some level of copyright protection, for example, related to the shell in which the 1308 \nmodel runs and the user-interface through which it is operated; however, full openness in the 1309 \ncode will ultimately allow scientists to interrogate the nuances of the numerical algorithms 1310 \nadopted to solve the standard ODE\/PDE model equations. This openness serves two 1311 \npurposes. First, it allows for a completely transparent and ongoing evaluation of the 1312 \ncorrectness of the model. Second, and more importantly, it allows for an easy 1313 \nreimplementation of parts of the model into new models, and this will ultimately facilitate 1314 \nmore rapid advance in model developments and associated applications. These new models 1315 \ncan be of the same type, or of hybrid types (e.g. a complex dynamic model with a 1316 \nphysiologically\/stage structured fish or zooplankton module). Openness of source code thus 1317 \ncan provide essential technical support to avoid both \u2017reinventing the wheel\u2018 and \u2017having 1318 \ntunnel vision\u2018. 1319 \n 1320 \nChallenges and opportunities: Recommendations 1321 \nWe would like to finish this paper with a list of practical and hopefully unpresumptuous 1322 \nrecommendations that \u2013 we believe \u2013 may be of help in the further development of lake 1323 \necosystem models. 1324 \n 1325 \nGeneral 1326 \n- While acknowledging ongoing initiatives like the Register of Ecological Models (REM, 1327 \nwww.ecobas.org, Benz et al. 2001), we feel that there is a need for more common 1328 \nvenues for the lake ecosystem modelling community (e.g. workshops, conferences 1329 \nand\/or a community website), to generate exposure to the scientific world, policy 1330 \nmakers, water quality managers and funding agencies, to enhance awareness of 1331 \n 49 \nmodels and model approaches and to transcend individual differences that keep us 1332 \napart. 1333 \n- Once a model and its results have been published and can be properly cited, the code 1334 \ndescribing the process formulations should not be protected by copyrights and 1335 \nshould be easily accessible in order to allow easier exchange and integration of 1336 \ndifferent models, to facilitate comparison of different model approaches for the same 1337 \nproblem and to allow for an ongoing assessment of the validity of the models. 1338 \n- Improved availability of global and regional data sets and better collaboration between data 1339 \ncollectors and data users are needed to warrant a correct interpretation of the data 1340 \nfor further model development and validation. 1341 \n 1342 \nEcological 1343 \n- The importance of top down control by fish and as a determinant of the state of aquatic 1344 \necosystems is greater than it is generally assumed and there is a need to incorporate 1345 \nthese impacts in lake ecosystem models.  1346 \n- When incorporating fish, but also with respect to zooplankton, attempts should be made, 1347 \nwhen observation data allow this, to represent them in a size- or stage-structured 1348 \nmanner since size-structured interactions may be fundamental to the dynamics of the 1349 \nsystem. 1350 \n- The process of sediment diagenesis as a determinant of the state of aquatic ecosystems is 1351 \ngenerally overly simplified or neglected altogether, and there is a need to improve 1352 \nthis aspect of lake ecosystem models. 1353 \n- There is an urgent need to focus more on biodiversity in lake ecosystem models. One of 1354 \nthe ways to achieve this is by linking empirically based relationships to output from 1355 \nthe dynamic models, such as total phosphorous and chlorophyll a. 1356 \n 1357 \nConceptual and technical 1358 \n 50 \n- Reuse of eutrophication models for studying climate change is a logical step but should be 1359 \ndone with great care, because the validity of the outcomes has generally not yet 1360 \nbeen properly tested against empirical data and field studies show clear synergistic 1361 \neffects that are not well covered by existing models. 1362 \n- Ongoing change in natural systems demands the inclusion of adaptive processes in lake 1363 \necosystem models. 1364 \n- There is an urgent need to find ways to integrate models focussing on spatial dynamics, 1365 \nhydrology and lower trophic levels with models that focus on the whole food web. 1366 \n- Sensitivity analysis, calibration and uncertainty analysis is not a one-time exercise but 1367 \nshould rather be an ongoing effort within a modelling program. 1368 \n- During model calibration and validation we should focus not only on state variables, but 1369 \nalso on process rates. 1370 \n- Metamodels provide a powerful tool to bridge the gap between state of the art dynamic 1371 \nmodels and easy to use static models. 1372 \n- In general, we believe that it will be fruitful to combine current dynamic and static model 1373 \napproaches. 1374 \n- In addition to detailed analyses, it is important to study the general non-linear behaviour of 1375 \ncomplex models using high level input and output parameters (e.g. P-loading, 1376 \nChlorophyll a concentration). 1377 \n- IBM approaches to lake ecosystems should give more attention to a proper handling of 1378 \ntime and mass balances. 1379 \n- We promote the modularity of source code through object-oriented programming (OOP) on 1380 \nan adequate level while preserving efficiency, readability and portability of the code. 1381 \n 1382 \nConcluding remarks 1383 \nIn this paper, we identify two challenges for making further progress in lake ecosystem 1384 \nmodelling: to avoid in future work \u2017reinventing the wheel\u2018 and \u2017having tunnel vision\u2018. While 1385 \n 51 \nthis may sound trivial, and has been stated before, the continuing repetition in published 1386 \nmodels and the fragmentation of the field of lake ecosystem modelling as a whole brings us 1387 \nto restating them and stressing their importance as we did in this paper. We do not think that 1388 \nthe main solution is in technically linking all kinds of models. Instead, we believe that 1389 \napplying multiple modelling approaches concurrently, using existing models and model 1390 \ncomponents, can help to develop an integrated scientific view on the functioning of lake 1391 \necosystems and to provide managers with essential ecological information for water quality 1392 \nmanagement. 1393 \n 1394 \nAcknowledgements 1395 \nWMM, RG, IP, SG, PV and AD were supported by grant 047.017.012 of the Netherlands 1396 \nOrganization for Scientific Research (NWO) and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research 1397 \n(RFBR).
