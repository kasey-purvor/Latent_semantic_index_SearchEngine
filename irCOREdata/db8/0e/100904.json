Emissions from the resulting ablation plumes,\nand from collisions with ablated material and the background N2 gas molecules, have been\ninvestigated by wavelength-, space-, and time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy \u0001OES\u0002, and\nthe observations correlated with the results of the analyses of films formed when such material is\nincident on a silicon substrate. Wavelength-dispersed spectra of the plume arising in nanosecond\nablation reveal C I, C II, and C2 emissions\u2014concentrated close to the target\u2014and, at greater\ndistances, strong CN and weak N2\n+ emissions. N2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emission dominates in the case of\nfemtosecond ablation. Time-gated imaging studies have allowed estimation of propagation\nvelocities for these various emissions. Possible production routes for secondary emitters such as CN\nand N2\n+ are discussed, and arguments presented to show that measurements of the apparent\npropagation \u201cvelocities\u201d of such emissions are unlikely to provide meaningful measures of the\nvelocities \u0001or energies\u0002 with which these carriers impact on a substrate surface.

The target, a 2 in. diam-\neter disk of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite \u0001HOPG,\n99.9% purity\u0002, was rotated to minimize repeated ablation of\nthe same spot. Pulses of 248 nm radiation with respective\nfull width at half maxima \u0001FWHM\u0002 of 15 ns and 450 fs were\ngenerated using two different laser systems, as described\npreviously.8,18 The respective pulse energies were\n\u000547 mJ\/15 ns pulse and \u00058.2 mJ\/450 fs pulse. The two la-\nser outputs have different spatial profiles, beam divergences,\netc., the spot sizes on the target were thus very different.

Previous studies of 248 nm PLA\nof graphite, in vacuum, have revealed C2\u0001d\u2013a\u0002 emission\u2014\nbut only in the region immediately adjacent to the target\nsurface.8 Formation of emitting C2 species is usually consid-\nered to involve gas phase collisional processes, in the high-\npressure and high-temperature region near the target. Intro-\nduction of a background gas, as here, and in companion\nstudies of the effect of Ar additions,19 should enhance the\nprobability of three-body recombination and\/or collisional\nexcitation processes within the plume\u2014consistent with our\nobservation of more intense and extensive C2\u0001d\u2013a\u0002 emission\nthan in the case of PLA in vacuum.\nFigures 3\u0001a\u0002 and 3\u0001b\u0002 compare observed C2\u0001d\u2013a\u0002 and\nCN\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 spectra \u0001measured at x=0 and 5 mm, respectively\u0002\nwith band contours simulated using known spectroscopic\nconstants for the d 3\u0007g and a\n3\u0007u states of C2,\n20 the B 2\b+\nand X 2\b+ states of CN,20,21 and the spectral simulation pro-\ngram PGOPHER.22 The simulation program assumes Boltz-\nmann vibrational and rotational state population distributions\nin the emitting species, but allows the option that these dis-\ntributions have different characteristic temperatures Tvib and\nTrot. The best-fit temperature values so derived are all hot.\nFor C2\u0001d\u0002, the best-fit \u0001by eye\u0002 simulation gives Tvib\n\u000510 000 K and Trot\u00058000 K, while for CN\u0001B\u0002 we find\nTvib\u000515 000 K and Trot\u000512 000 K. These \u201ctemperatures\u201d\nshould be regarded as indicative only. The CN\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 simu-\nlations overestimate the width of the highest \u0001v\u0001 ,v\u0002\u0002 transi-\ntions \u0003e.g., the \u000113,13\u0002 feature at 390.6 nm\u0004; a better descrip-\ntion of the CN\u0001B\u0002 population distribution could probably be\nobtained using a Trot function that decreases with increasing\nv\u0001. Comparable levels of internal excitation in the C2\u0001d\u0002 and\nCN\u0001B\u0002 products arising in the UV PLA of graphite ablation\nin low background pressures of N2 have been deduced\npreviously;23 the implied average internal \u0001i.e., vibrational\nplus rotational\u0002 energies amount to \u00051 and \u00052 eV, respec-\ntively.\nThe spectra displayed in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 were obtained using\n450 fs laser pulses.

The upper \u0001x\n=0\u0002 spectrum shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002 is dominated by emissions\nfrom C atoms, C+ ions, and C2\u0001d\u0002 radicals, whereas CN\u0001B\u0002\nradicals make the dominant contribution in the lower \u0001x\n=5 mm\u0002 spectrum. Clearly, the species that show strongly in\nthese spectra must be those that make the greatest contribu-\ntion when integrating throughout the 1 \u0006s viewing window,\nbut additional information is needed if we are to tell whether\nany given feature is from a relatively intense but short-lived\nemission or from a weaker but persistent emission. The time-\ngated images provide some of the necessary insights. Images\nrecorded through the 520 nm bandpass filter are unarguably\nassociated with C2\u0001d\u2013a\u0002 emission.

The localized contributions from C2\u0001d\u2013a\u0002\nemission are also recognizable \u0001at x\u00050\u0002 in the images of\ntotal emission \u0001bottom row in Fig. 5\u0002.\nThe total emission images reveal the presence of faster\ncomponents in the plume. Figure 4\u0001a\u0002 suggests that much of\nthe imaged total emission must be associated with CN\u0001B\u0002\nradicals, but none of the bandpass filters employed are ap-\npropriate for isolating CN\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emission. CN radicals in\ntheir lower-lying A 2\u0007 state, if present, would emit at \u0002\n\u0003780 nm,20 however. So, too, would a range of C I\ntransitions\u2014which have been observed in previous studies of\ngraphite ablation, in vacuum, in this apparatus.8 Thus, we\npropose two distinct contributions to the time-gated images\nof \u0002\u0003780 nm emission; C I emissions, which are most im-\nportant at small x and t, and CN\u0001A\u2013X\u0002 emission which be-\ncomes dominant as x, t, and the number of collisions be-\ntween ablated carbon species and background N2 increases.\nSuch an interpretation is supported by the I vs x plots derived\nfrom the \u0002\u0003780 nm images \u0003Fig. 7\u0001c\u0002\u0004, which we interpret\nin terms of a slow component, that appears strongly at early\ntime but fades as t increases, and a less intense but more\npersistent faster \u0001i.e., larger x\u0002 component that dominates the\nlater time images. This progressive switch in the identity of\nthe dominant emitter accounts for the nonlinearity in the\nearly time part of the x vs t plot derived from the \u0002\n\u0003780 nm images \u0003Fig. 9\u0001a\u0002\u0004. Previous studies of C I emis-\nsions arising in the 248 nm PLA of graphite, in vacuum, in\nthis same apparatus, yielded initial propagation velocities\n\u0006v\u0007\u000517 km s\u22121 \u0001Ref. 8\u0002\u2014similar to the early time slope of\nthe \u0002\u0003780 nm emission in Fig. 9\u0001a\u0002. Reasons why the\nCN\u0001A\u0002 emitters\u2014that are proposed to develop with increas-\ning t\u2014should exhibit faster expansion velocities than the C I\nemissions are discussed later. Nonetheless, the accumulated\nevidence at this stage suggests that CN\u0001B\u0002 and CN\u0001A\u0002 radi-\ncals both contribute to the time-gated total emission images,\nthat the latter make a major contribution to the \u0002\u0003780 nm\nimages, and that both emissions propagate with similar\nvelocities\u2014i.e., \u000540 km s\u22121 up to t\u0005400 ns and more\nslowly thereafter.\nWe now consider the images obtained viewing the plume\naccompanying nanosecond PLA through the 426 nm band-\npass filter. This filter will transmit C II emission associated\nwith the C+\u00014f ; 2Fo\u20133d ; 2D\u0002 transition at 426.7 nm\u2014which\nshowed strongly in studies of the 248 nm PLA of graphite in\nvacuum\n8\nand in low pressures of Ar.19 It would also transmit\nN2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 \tv= +1 emission\u2014if present. N2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emis-\nsion is clearly evident in the femtosecond PLA studies and,\nas Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 illustrates, the Franck-Condon factors associated\nwith the N2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 transition ensure that the \tv=0 sequence\nwill always be much more intense than the \tv= +1 se-\nquence. Wavelength-dispersed spectra obtained following\nnanosecond PLA of graphite in N2 \u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004 show no obvi-\nous N2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emission. Thus we conclude that the 426 nm\nimages shown in Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002 map the propagation of emitting\nC+ ions. This emission has died out by t\u0005400 ns, but the\ndeduced propagation velocity up to that time, \u0006v\u0007\no AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n014309-7 Fuge, Ashfold, and Henley J. Appl. Phys. 99, 014309 \u00022006\u0001=36.4\u00b10.5 km s\u22121, is similar to that found for the CN emis-\nsions. The deduction that the speeds of the emitting C+ ions\nand CN radicals are similar, and faster than those of the\nemitting C neutrals, may offer clues about the collisional\nprocesses responsible for the observed CN emissions.\nAnalysis of wavelength-dispersed spectra of the plume\nemission accompanying femtosecond PLA such as those\nshown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 revealed the presence of C2\u0001d\u0002 radicals at\nsmall x, CN\u0001B\u0002 radicals\u2014localized at smaller x than in the\ncase of nanosecond PLA\u2014and substantial emission from\nN2\n+\u0001B\u0002 ions. The short \u000120 ns\u0002-time-gated images shown in\nFig. 6 provide complementary insights. As in the nanosecond\nPLA studies, the weak, rapidly decaying emission imaged\nthrough the 520 nm bandpass filter and localized close to the\nlaser-target interaction volume is attributable to C2\u0001d\u0002 radi-\ncals. As discussed above, the 426 nm bandpass filter can\ntransmit both C+\u00014f ; 2Fo\u20133d ; 2D\u0002 and N2+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 \tv= +1\nemissions. The latter dominate the \u0001time-integrated\u0002\nwavelength-dispersed emission spectra, but the deduced\nspeed of the 426 nm emitters in the short t images shown in\nFig. 6\u0001a\u0002 suggests that, as in the nanosecond case, excited C+\nions are the main contributions to the early time emission at\nthis wavelength. As Fig. 9\u0001b\u0002 shows, the average speed of\nthese emitting C+ ions must be \u000575 km s\u22121 in the early \u0001t\n\n120 ns\u0002, preobservation stages of the expansion; the best-\nfit gradient of the xpeak vs t plot in the observation range\n120\n t\n350 ns is \u0006v\u0007=28\u00b12 km s\u22121. These values, and the\ntrend in the xpeak vs t plot, are reminiscent of those found in\nthe case of femtosecond 248 nm PLA of graphite in\nvacuum.\n8 The \u0002\u0003780 nm images \u0003Fig. 6\u0001c\u0002\u0004 also reveal\nemission from a spread of x values at early t. As in the\nnanosecond PLA experiments, we associate this with CN\u0001A\u0002\nfragments which we assume to be formed in parallel with the\nCN\u0001B\u0002 fragments identified in the wavelength-dispersed\nspectra recorded at small x. What is also evident from the\nimages in Fig. 6\u0001c\u0002, however, and clearer still from the gra-\ndient of the corresponding xpeak vs t plot \u0003Fig. 9\u0001b\u0002\u0004, is that\nthe subsequent expansion of this emission is slow, \u0006v\u0007\n=3.4\u00b10.6 km s\u22121.\nOne other notable aspect of Fig. 6 is the dissimilarity\nbetween the images of the total OES and those of the various\nwavelength-selected emissions recorded with the same time\ngate. Clearly, the dominant contributor to the total OES\npropagates at lower velocity than the species responsible for\nthe early time 426 nm and \u0002\u0003780 nm emissions \u0003i.e., C+\nions and CN\u0001A\u0002 radicals, respectively\u0004. Such faster emission\nis discernable in the total OES images shown in Fig. 6\u0001d\u0002,\nand can be seen more clearly from the corresponding I vs x\nplots shown in Fig. 8\u0001c\u0002. Given the dominance of N2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002\nemission in the wavelength-resolved spectra recorded at x\n\u00030 \u0003see Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002, and the x=5 mm data shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002\u0004,\nit is reasonable to assume that this emission is the dominant\ncontributor to the total OES images also. The gradient of the\nxpeak vs t plot of this emission \u0003\u0001 in Fig. 9\u0001b\u0002\u0004 yields an\napparent propagation velocity \u0006v\u0007=9.7\u00b10.2 km s\u22121.\nAnalysis of deposited CNx films\nMaterial coating was not the major thrust of the present\nwork.

Its non-\nobservation in the Raman spectra of films grown by femto-\nsecond PLA may suggest that the extent of N incorporation\nand\/or bonding is lower than in the case of films grown by\nnanosecond PLA\u2014consistent with the somewhat lower\nI\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002 ratios observed for such films. However, we also\nnote the comparative weakness of the Raman signal from the\nCNx film grown by femtosecond PLA \u0003as compared with the\nbackground Si feature at \u0005950 cm\u22121 \u0001Fig. 10\u0001b\u0002\u0002\u0004, reflecting\nthe facts that femtosecond PLA yields thinner films than\nthose grown from nanosecond pulses of the same fluence,\nand that the amount of material ejected per femtosecond\npulse is much smaller.\nDISCUSSION\nFilm analysis confirms that CNx films are grown by\n248 nm PLA of graphite in a low pressure of N2, using both\nnanosecond and femtosecond laser pulse durations, and that\nnanosecond PLA results in films that are thicker and have a\nhigher degree of N incorporation. The main focus of the\npresent work, however, is the use of wavelength-, spatially,\nand temporally resolved OESs to unravel clues as to how N\nis incorporated within such films.\nIrrespective of the pulse duration, the initial laser-target\ninteraction can only lead to ejection of carbonaceous mate-\nrial, mainly atoms and atomic ions, as well as electrons. As\nin the case of ablation in vacuum,8 or in a low background\npressure of Ar,19 the most likely route to forming C2 species\nwill involve atom-atom recombination reactions, stabilized\nby a third body \u0001generally N2 in the present case\u0002. Since the\nC atom \u0001and ion\u0002 density will be highest in the small volume\nadjacent to the irradiated area on the target surface, the ob-\nservation that the C2\u0001d\u2013a\u0002 emission intensity peaks at small\nx and t is unsurprising. Similarly, the observation that the\nC2\u0001d\u2013a\u0002 emission in the femtosecond PLA study is weaker,\nand even more spatially localized, accords with the finding\nthat femtosecond PLA causes less material removal per\npulse.\nEmitting C, C+, and C2+ species have all been identified\nin previous UV PLA studies of graphite in vacuum,8,26 and in\nAr,19 and propagation velocities reported that are similar to\nthose measured in the present work. The natural radiative\nlifetimes \u000brad of many of the emitting states of these atomic\nspecies are significantly shorter than the times over which\ntheir emission is observed, implying the operation of one \u0001or\nmore\u0002 mechanism for populating the observed emitting lev-\nels, post-ablation. One such mechanism in the case of atomic\nspecies is collisionally assisted electron-ion recombination\n\u0001EIR\u0002, whereby Mn+ ions and electrons combine to yield\n\u0001n\u22121\u0002+M species in high-lying Rydberg states; these subse-\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

However, any detailed inter-\npretation will require more detailed knowledge of the carbon\natom and ion, and C2 radical, number density distributions,\ntheir respective kinetic-energy distributions, and their respec-\ntive collision-energy-dependent reaction cross sections with\nN2 than can be provided simply by OES measurements.\nPrevious investigations of emitting electronically, vibra-\ntionally, and rotationally excited CN radicals \u0001henceforth\nrepresented simply as CN* if the electronic state is unimpor-\ntant\u0002 formed via PLA of graphite in N2 \u0001Refs. 27\u201330\u0002 have\ninvoked a role for the four-center reaction\nC2 + N2\u2192 2CN, \u00011\u0002\nwhich is only slightly endothermic, \tH0\n0\u00050.51 eV, but has\nan activation energy of \u00051.8 eV \u0001for the ground-state\nspecies\u0002.31 Such a proposal appears attractive, both on ener-\ngetic grounds and because of the obvious correlation be-\ntween the relative strengths of the CN\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 and C2\u0001d\u2013a\u0002\nemission intensities. It also accords, qualitatively, with the\nobservation \u0001Fig. 4\u0002 that the fall in the density of emitting\nC2\u0001d\u0002 radicals \u0001with increasing x\u0002 roughly complements the\ngrowth of CN\u0001B\u0002 emission. Such an interpretation is unlikely\nto be the complete story, however\u2014particularly when it\ncomes to explaining production of the fastest emitting CN\nproducts.\nPlume production and propagation through a background\ngas are often discussed in terms of a three-stage process:\nlinear expansion, shock wave formation, and plume stop-\nping. The first stage involves free expansion of the plume,\nwith little influence from the background gas. Such is prob-\nably appropriate for the case of the species responsible for\nthe C I and C II emissions above, the velocities of which\nshow no obvious retardation with increasing x. New and\/or\nenhanced emissions are observed away from the target sur-\nface, once some mixing of the plume species and the back-\nground gas has occurred\u2014and assuming that the ensuing en-\ncounters result in reaction and\/or excitation. This stage may\ninvolve formation of a shock front, if the background pres-\nsure is sufficiently high. Given the low N2 pressures in the\no AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n014309-9 Fuge, Ashfold, and Henley J. Appl. Phys. 99, 014309 \u00022006\u0001present work, we neglect possible shock wave formation and\nuse simple kinetic theory of gases arguments to estimate a\nfew relevant time scales and distances. On this basis, the\nmean free path for an ablated particle propagating at\n20 km s\u22121 in 20 mTorr of N2 would be a few millimeters,\nand the mean time \u0001\u000b\u0002 between collisions for such a particle\nwill be 10\u201320 ns. For two background N2 gas molecules, the\ncorresponding values are the same few millimeters and \u000b\n\u00055 \u0006s. The CN* emissions observed in the nanosecond\nPLA studies are seen to maximize at x\u00055 mm\u2014as observed\nby others also.32\u201334 The apparent propagation velocities of\nthe CN* emitters are comparable to those deduced for the\nemitting C+ ions and C neutrals, but about an order of mag-\nnitude faster than those of the observed C2\u0001d\u0002 radicals.\nHow should we interpret the apparent propagation veloc-\nity of CN* radicals derived from plots like those in Fig. 9?\nAs pointed out previously,35 the short radiative lifetime of\nthe CN\u0001B\u0002 state dictates that such excited radicals must emit\nalmost as soon as they are formed, i.e., that the time-gated\nimages of the CN\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emission reveal the positions of\nsuccessful CN\u0001B\u0002 forming encounters during the time win-\ndow of the observation. We note that the later-time \u0002\n\u0003780 nm images in Fig. 5\u0001c\u0002, which we attribute largely to\nCN\u0001A\u2013X\u0002 emission, appear somewhat fuzzier than the cor-\nresponding total OES images \u0003Fig. 5\u0001d\u0002, which are domi-\nnated by CN\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emission\u0004. Such is consistent with the\nlonger \u000brad value of the CN\u0001A\u0002 state, which allows some\nrelaxation of the constraint that precludes the emitting prod-\nuct traveling any significant distance in the time between\ncreation and emission.\nThus we view CN* emission as a signifier of the first\nreactive encounter involving its C-containing precursor gen-\nerated in the PLA process. Contrary to at least one previous\ndiscussion,23 the \u201cvelocity\u201d of the CN* products deduced\nfrom the initial slope of a plot such as that shown in Fig. 9\ndoes not provide a measure of the velocity \u0001or thus of the\nkinetic energy\u0002 of the CN* radicals themselves. Rather, they\nprovide some measure of the velocity of the reactive precur-\nsor involved in CN* radical formation. The \u201cvelocities\u201d de-\nrived from analysis of the short-time images of both the\nCN\u0001A\u0002 and CN\u0001B\u0002 emissions exceed the velocity of the C I\nemission observed in the nanosecond 248 nm PLA of graph-\nite in vacuum.8 Conceivably, this could indicate that the\nfaster fraction of the carriers responsible for the C I emission\nhas a higher reaction probability with N2. We note, however,\nthat the early time velocity of the CN\u0001B\u0002 products matches\nwell with that derived by monitoring the C II emission. Our\nearlier thesis that C II emission is a signifier of ablation prod-\nucts that begin life as C2+ ions and then undergo electron-ion\nrecombination in the early stages of the expansion, thus leads\nto the suggestion that the faster CN* products observed in the\nearly time images are probably formed via abstraction\u2013\ncharge-transfer reactions such as36\u201338\nC+ + N2\u2192 N+ + CN, \u00012\u0002\nor even, possibly, from C2++N2 collisions. Reaction \u00012\u0002 is\nendothermic, \tH0\n0\u00055.26 eV,36 when all reactants and prod-\nucts are in their respective ground states. However, the C+\n2+ 39\u2192C ionization energy is 24.38 eV.

Redistribution subject tC+ that are assumed to be present in the plume will thus have\nample internal \u0001electronic\u0002 energy to drive the forward reac-\ntion. As shown below, the likely collision energies are also\nmore than sufficient to surmount an activation barrier of this\nmagnitude. A recent study by Park and Lee40 lends support to\nthis proposed mechanism. These workers investigated the\nOES accompanying nanosecond 266 nm PLA of graphite in\na range of N2 pressures but, in contrast to the present study,\nmapped the emission in the xy plane, by viewing down the z\naxis. Spatially localized C2\u0001d\u2013a\u0002 and CN\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emissions\nwere observed, at a number of different time delays. The\nformer expanded more slowly, and died out more\nquickly\u2014as in the present work. One other, significant, dif-\nference was apparent, however. The C2\u0001d\u2013a\u0002 emission was\nobserved to expand symmetrically about the surface normal\n\u0001x\u0002, but the CN\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emission was found to be anisotropic\nabout x and to propagate along an axis inclined towards the\naxis of the incident laser beam.40 Such behavior has been\nseen previously, for the case of the C II emissions arising in\nthe nanosecond 193 nm PLA of graphite in vacuum, and\nrationalized in terms of preferential multiphoton excitation\nand ionization of C species in the leading part of the expand-\ning plasma ball that are exposed to the greatest incident pho-\nton flux, and subsequent EIR and radiative decay.26 Such\nanisotropy could not be seen in the present study because of\nthe viewing geometry, whereby the incident laser axis\nprojects onto the surface normal. Any asymmetry evident in\nthe present images \u0003see, e.g., Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002\u0004 is attributed to the\ninhomogeneous spatial profile of the nanosecond excimer la-\nser output.\nGiven the foregoing interpretation of the apparent ve-\nlocities of the CN* emitters, there remains a question as to\nwhat might be the real impact velocity of such species on the\nsurface of the substrate on which a CNx film is grown.\nAnalyses of images of CN* emission taken at later t \u0001the xpeak\ndata from which are summarized in Fig. 9\u0002 imply much\nslower expansion velocities, but still do not provide any clear\nanswer. The substrate in our experiments is positioned at x\n=30 mm, and inspection of I vs x plots such as those shown\nin Fig. 7\u0001c\u0002 shows a definite enhancement in the CN* emis-\nsion intensity at larger x in images recorded at later t. As\nnoted previously,23 the presence of the substrate introduces\nseveral possible secondary excitation mechanisms. For ex-\nample, collision of a gas phase species with the substrate\nsurface offers a route for converting the incident kinetic en-\nergy of the former into internal \u0001electronic, vibrational, rota-\ntional\u0002 excitation. Such gas-surface collisions can also lead\nto compaction of previously deposited material within the\nfilm, and to the sputtering of such material back into the gas\nphase. Purely gas phase collisions involving an incident spe-\ncies and one that has scattered from the surface will involve\nhigher than average collision energies. All such processes\ncould lead to an increase in optical emission in the vicinity of\nthe substrate; the relative intensities, and the spatial extent,\nof any such emissions will vary with t because of the time\ndependence of the density, composition, and energy content\nof the incident pulse of gas created by the PLA event \u0001and\nmodified by subsequent gas phase collisions\u0002.One estimate of the average velocity with which CN\no AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n014309-10 Fuge, Ashfold, and Henley J. Appl. Phys. 99, 014309 \u00022006\u0001radicals strike the substrate can be obtained from the colli-\nsion frequency and mean-free-path estimates quoted previ-\nously. Let us start by assuming that fast CN* radical forma-\ntion is via the C++N2 abstraction\u2013charge-transfer reaction\n\u00012\u0002, that the initial C+ ion velocity vx=20 km s\u22121 along the\ntarget surface normal and, for simplicity, that the background\nN2 molecules are stationary. In this model, the laboratory and\ncenter-of-mass frames are equivalent, and the initial C++N2\ncollision energy \u0001Ecoll\u000517.5 eV\u0002 is more than sufficient to\novercome the endothermicity of reaction \u00012\u0002. The C+ ions\nseen in the OES carry electronic energy also, but we assume\nthat most of the C+ ions available to participate in reaction\n\u00012\u0002 are in their ground state, so we ignore possible additional\n\u0001electronic\u0002 contributions to the energy available for reaction.\nGiven these assumptions, the energy available to the N+\n+CN products is \u000512.1 eV \u0001\u00058.9 eV in the case that the CN\nproducts are in the v=0 level of the B state\u0002. If all of this\navailable energy is partitioned into product translation, the\nresulting CN\u0001B\u0002 fragments can have any velocity in the\nrange of 10.8\u0004vx\u00041.2 km s\u22121, where the limits correspond\nto, respectively, pure stripping and pure rebound dynamics.\nThese numbers are meant to be illustrative only. Clearly,\nsome reactive encounters will involve greater initial energies\n\u0001either from reactant electronic excitation, or as a result of a\nhigher impact kinetic energy\u0002 but equally, in many cases,\nmore of the reaction exoergicity than has been assumed here\nwill be channeled into non-translational degrees of freedom\n\u0003e.g., CN\u0001B\u0002 vibrational excitation or electronic excitation of\nthe N+ cofragment\u0004. Given a target-substrate separation of\n30 mm and an estimated mean free path in 20 mTorr of N2\nof 5 mm, the resulting CN radical is likely to suffer several\nfurther \u0001non-reactive\u0002 collisions\u2014most probably with back-\nground N2 molecules\u2014before striking the substrate. If we\npersist with the foregoing simplifications, momentum con-\nservation could cause \u0006vx\u0007 to be reduced by as much as 50%\nin each subsequent collision. Thus it is difficult to envisage\nthat the average impact velocity of CN radicals striking a\nsubstrate 30 mm distant from a graphite target subjected to\nnanosecond 248 nm PLA in 20 mTorr of N2 will be more\nthan a few km s\u22121 \u0001vx=5 km s\u22121 equates to an impact energy\nof \u00057 eV\u0002.\nIn closing this discussion of CN radical formation,\npropagation, and impact on the substrate surface we recall\nthat C I emissions also contribute to the observed OES. The\nultimate result of such emissions will be formation of\nground-state C atoms. Reaction \u00013\u0002, the activation energy for\nwhich has been estimated at \u00051.9 eV,31,41 thus represents\nanother potential source of CN radicals,\nC + N2\u2192 CN + N. \u00013\u0002\nThe total C atom density in the ablation plume is likely to be\nfar higher than the C+ ion density. Recall that the EIR inter-\npretation associates C I emissions with species created as C+\nions in the initial PLA event. Charged species experience an\ninitial \u0001Coulombic\u0002 acceleration not available to neutral\nejecta, and will thus typically exhibit higher recoil velocities.\nThe C atoms available to react with background N2 gas mol-\necules are thus expected to have a broad velocity distribu-\n+tion, with a faster fraction deriving from C ions that have\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tundergone EIR and subsequent relaxation, and a slower com-\nponent that was created as neutral atoms. Ecoll for the faster\nfraction of C+N2 collisions may well be \u000310 eV, so it\nwould be foolish to exclude reaction \u00013\u0002 as another probable\nsource of CN radicals available for incorporation in any\neventual CNx film. That said, it is hard to see how CN radi-\ncals formed via this route could have incident kinetic ener-\ngies larger than those deduced in the foregoing consideration\nof the C++N2 reaction products. Reaction \u00011\u0002 is unarguably\ncapable of producing CN radicals also, but the slow recoil\nvelocities deduced for the emitting C2 species in the plume\nsuggest that these will, if anything, have even smaller vx\nvalues.\nN2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emission is evident in the OES accompanying\nnanosecond 248 nm PLA of graphite in N2, and dominates\nthe emission seen in the femtosecond studies. Femtosecond\nPLA releases much less carbon per pulse, so the relative\nyield of C2 radicals \u0001which are considered to arise via recom-\nbination of gas phase C atoms\u0002 would be expected, and is\nobserved, to be much lower than in the corresponding nano-\nsecond study. Femtosecond PLA involves much higher peak\nintensities, and the resulting plume is generally more highly\nionized. Thus the plume formed via femtosecond PLA\nshould contain a higher Cn+ \/C ratio \u0001n\u00041\u0002\u2014a prediction in\naccord with the present OES data, and with femtosecond\nPLA studies of graphite in Ar \u0001Ref. 19\u0002 and in vacuum.8\nCn++N2 collisions should thus be relatively more important\nin the case of femtosecond PLA. We have argued that C+\n+N2, C+N2, and C2+N2 reactive encounters probably all\ncontribute to the CN* emission seen in the nanosecond PLA\nstudies. The CN* emission following femtosecond PLA is\nmuch weaker\u2014reflecting the reduced contributions from, es-\npecially, reactions \u00011\u0002 and \u00013\u0002. Previous guided ion mass\nspectrometry studies of the C++N2 reaction have revealed a\nsubstantial role for the charge-transfer channel\nC+ + N2\u2192 C + N2+, \u00014\u0002\nat all collision energies above threshold \u0003\tH0\n0\n=4.32 eV for\nall ground-state species, and 7.48 eV for ground-state reac-\ntant forming N2\n+\u0001B\u0002\u0004; this channel becomes totally dominant\nat Ecoll\u000520 eV.36 We have found no detailed studies of the\nway in which C+ electronic excitation affects the product\nbranching, or of the related reaction involving C2+ ions. It is\nthus tempting to attribute the dominance of N2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emis-\nsion in the OES following femtosecond PLA of graphite in\nN2 to reaction \u00014\u0002. The comparatively slow speed with which\nthis localized emission expands, and its persistence, both\nmerit comment, however. Inspection of Fig. 9\u0001b\u0002 suggests\nsome curvature of the xpeak vs t plot for the N2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emis-\nsion; the gradient first increases and then appears to decrease\nwith increasing t. The deduced propagation speed at early\ntimes is, in fact, rather similar to that predicted by the pre-\nvious momentum conservation arguments, and could be rea-\nsonable if charge transfer is favored by a stripping-type\nmechanism, and less momentum is thus transferred to the\nresulting N2\n+ ion. If this ion was formed in its B state, it\nshould decay radiatively, within \u000560 ns\u2014i.e., essentially at\nthe point where the charge transfer occurred.

We also recognize\nthat the present observations could be explained by invoking\npopulation of a higher-energy, metastable, state of N2\n+\n,\nwhich feeds into the \u0001observed\u0002 N2\n+\u0001B\u0002 state over an ex-\ntended time scale. In the absence of additional information\nabout C2++N2 reaction mechanisms, and\/or about suitable\nmetastable excited states of N2\n+\n, however, we consider the\nfollowing to be the most plausible explanation for the present\nobservations: Femtosecond PLA leads to a relatively low \u0001in\ncomparison with nanosecond PLA\u0002 yield of ejected material\nper pulse, comprising neutrals, Cn+ ions, and electrons.\nCharge transfer results in N2\n+ ion formation, and rapid deple-\ntion of the Cn+ number density\u2014at small x. Some momen-\ntum is transferred in the charge-transfer process, so the re-\nsulting N2\n+ ions acquire an expansion velocity. The electrons\nformed in the ablation process track the positive charges,\nwhich now reside with the expanding cloud of N2\n+ ions \u0001am-\nbipolar expansion\u0002. Numerous studies, involving a wide\nrange of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, have demon-\nstrated that electron collisions with N2\n+ ions lead to intense\nN2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emission. Calculated electron-impact excitation\ncross sections42 for this process accord with the observed\ndominance of the v\u0001=0\u2192v\u0002=0 band at 391.4 nm. The\ncharge-transfer mechanism \u00014\u0002, followed by one \u0001or possibly\nmore\u0002 subsequent electron-impact excitations, can also ac-\ncount for the modest N2\n+ rotational excitation deduced from\nthe simulations of the observed OES. Electron collisions\nwith neutral N2 molecules can also lead to N2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002 emis-\nsion if the collision energies are sufficiently high; such exci-\ntations may gain in importance at larger x as the density of\nN2\n+ falls \u0001as it must do if any of the electron-ion encounters\nresult in a dissociative recombination rather than excitation\u0002\nand might help to explain both the persistence of this par-\nticular emission and the observed slowing of the N2\n+\u0001B\u2013X\u0002\nemission at large x.\nCONCLUSION\nFundamental aspects of the nanosecond and femtosec-\nond 248 nm PLAs of graphite in low pressures of N2 have\nbeen investigated by wavelength-, space-, and time-resolved\noptical emission spectroscopy and by analysis of the result-\ning CNx films.
