An asymmetric, shorter pulse profile, as opposed to the\nconventional Gaussian profile retains the desirable gradual leading edge of the Gaussian pulse for\ncontrolled evolution of hydrogen, while increasing the peak energy.

Melting and solidi-\nfying occur on a nanosecond time scale, often without affect-\ning the underlying substrate. This technique enables the use\nof inexpensive substrates, such as glass, which are highly\npreferable for low cost, large-area electronic devices. Films\nwith adequate thickness for light harvesting crystallize in the\npartial melting regime.2,3 The properties of crystallized sili-\ncon depend on a number of factors, with laser pulse shape\nbeing one of the most significant. Conventionally, a Gaussian\nprofile along the long axis of the pulse has been reported to\nbe best suited for controlled evolution of hydrogen during\ncrystallization.8,9 Our previous report shows typical energy\ndensities for crystallization with the crystalline volume and\nsurface roughness comparisons of the resultant films for dif-\nferent film thicknesses.2 Here, we report a significant reduc-\ntion of crystallization laser energy density required to yield a\ngiven crystalline volume by modifying the Gaussian pulse\nprofile, while retaining the controlled evolution of hydrogen\nfrom a-Si:H films.\nChemical vapor deposited 300 and 500 nm thick a-Si:H\non a 100 nm thick silicon nitride, capped Corning 1737 glass\nwas used for the experiments. The films contain 10% atomic\nhydrogen, as specified by the deposition facility. A KrF\nLambda Physik excimer laser \u0001LPX 210i\u0002, operating at\n248 nm with a 25 ns full width at half maximum pulse du-\nration, was used for crystallization. The a-Si:H films on\nglass were crystallized in vacuum, at a base pressure of 5\n\u000110\u22124 mbar, by scanning along the laser pulse. The scan-\nning speed for the experiment was 2.5 mm s\u22121 with pulse\nrepetition rate maintained at 50 Hz. Experimental details are\nas similar to that used for crystallization of a-Si:H with the\nGaussian pulse profile in Ref. 2, for comparison purposes,\napart from the laser pulse profile and maximum energy den-\nsity used. A series of incremental energy densities of up to\n200 mJ cm\u22122 per pulse was used for crystallization, with\n25 mJ cm\u22122 increments. The laser energy was measured us-\ning a Molectron EPM 1000 analyzer and a J25LP-MUV py-\nroelectric detector. Due to the pulse-to-pulse variation of the\nexcimer laser energy, it is estimated that the measured energy\ndensities have an error of up to 10%.10\nThe laser pulse incident on the silicon film was imaged\nusing a set of image capture apparatus involving a camera.\nThe image yields the shape of the laser pulse, normalized to\nthe peak energy density of the pulse. For this work, a 4\n\u00018 mm2 laser pulse was used for crystallization. The laser\nenergy is constant along the short axis of the pulse profile,\nwhereas the long axis was an asymmetric peak profile; with\na steeper trailing edge compared with the leading edge. The\npulse profile was arrived at mathematically, by curve fitting\nusing 20 data points along the long axis of the captured\nimage of the pulse. The same procedure was followed to\nmodel the Gaussian pulse profile used in Ref. 2, which is of\nsimilar width but 10 mm long. Since the short axis energy\nprofile is constant for both pulse shapes, the areas under the\nfitted curves of the long axis profile were equated and the\ncorresponding normalized peak energy for the asymmetric\npulse was calculated.

A Renishaw 2000 Ramascope was used\nfor Raman measurements with 782 nm excitation. The esti-\nmated crystalline volume fractions of the resultant laser crys-\ntallized silicon films plotted against crystallization energy\ndensity are shown in Fig. 2. The error in the calculation was\nestimated to be 1%, assuming the 782 nm Raman excitation\nlaser probes to be as deep as 500 nm. With the Gaussian\npulse, evidence of crystallization is not observed for 300 or\n500 nm thick films at 50 mJ cm\u22122. With the asymmetric\npulse, the 300 nm thick silicon film shows a small crystalline\nvolume, although for the 500 nm films no change is ob-\nserved. However, with increasing crystallization energy den-\nsities, a clear trend of higher crystalline volumes are realized\nfor both 300 and 500 nm thick films, with the asymmetric\npulse compared to a Gaussian pulse. The higher crystalline\nvolume yield is consistent; however, the percentage increase\nof crystalline volume from Gaussian to asymmetric pulse\nfluctuates as the laser energy density is increased. During the\nscanning process, the film is imparted a higher energy den-\nsity over a small area at the peak, which decides the maxi-\nmum melt depth of the silicon film. It is argued that the\nhigher peak energy of the asymmetric pulse is the fundamen-\ntal reason for the higher crystalline volume yield.\nHigher peak energy is realized by adjusting two param-\neters of the laser pulse; the length of the laser pulse and the\noff setting of the peak. Off setting of the peak allows us to\nattain a gradual increase of laser energy on the leading edge.\nThe gradual increase of energy is expected to help control\nthe evolution of hydrogen during crystallization, which is the\nmain advantage of using a Gaussian pulse profile.8 Con-\ntrolled evolution of hydrogen results in smoother film sur-\nfaces after crystallization, which is of importance for thin\nfilm transistor applications. The surface roughness of the la-\nser crystallized silicon with the asymmetric pulse was esti-\nmated by atomic force microscopy over a 25 \u0002m2 area using\na Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 scanning probe micro-\nscope in atomic force microscopy mode. Figure 3 shows the\nrms roughness of the laser crystallized silicon, for both\nGaussian and asymmetric pulses. Up to a laser energy den-\nsity of 100 mJ cm\u22122, rms roughness of laser crystallized sili-\ncon using both shapes of the laser pulse is \u00052 nm, which is\nsimilar to the surface roughness of a-Si:H of both 300 and\n500 nm thicknesses. However, above 100 mJ cm\u22122, the sur-\nface roughness of films crystallized with the asymmetric\npulse increase rapidly compared to films crystallized with the\nGaussian pulse. Both thicknesses show an increased surface\nroughness at higher energy densities. However, the rough-\nness values for 300 and 500 nm thick films crystallized with\nthe asymmetric pulse are similar, indicating similar crystal-\nlization dynamics for both thicknesses of the films. Films\ncrystallized with a Gaussian pulse do not show this similar-\nity, as is evident from the reproduced roughness data from\nRef. 2.\nThe increased surface roughness can be explained using\nthe higher peak energy realized with the asymmetric func-\ntion. The a-Si:H films are expected to contain a couple of\nnanometers thick native oxide layer,12 which is expected to\nbe transparent to 248 nm excimer laser \u00015 eV\u0002. Therefore,\nthe underlying a-Si:H layer is expected to melt following\nthe energy profile of the pulse. During crystallization, at and\nclose to the highest energy point, the films must be subjected\nto some level of ablation, removing material out including\nthe native oxide which can lead to increased surface rough-\nness. Further, it has been suggested by McCulloch and\nBrotherton8 that the surface roughness from the previous\nshots would act as a diffraction grating, creating diffracted\nwaves parallel to the surface. These parallel waves are be-\nlieved to be interfering with the incident wave. Where a suf-\nficiently high maximum occurs, surface modifications take\nplace, such as local melting and surface roughness effects.\nTherefore, successive laser pulses would further enhance the\nroughness, initiated by roughness created by initial pulse due\nto ablation.\nThe fluctuation in surface roughness values for the 300\nand 500 nm films when crystallized with a Gaussian pulse\ncan also be explained using ablation at the peak energy.\nSince pulse-to-pulse variation is about 10% for the excimer\nFIG. 2.

Increased surface roughness may be undesirable for\nthin film transistor applications. However, the rough profile\nof the surface may be a useful by-product of the process for\nphotovoltaics since it can be utilized as a light scattering\nmechanism. Also, the increased roughness can be advanta-\ngeous for electron field emission applications, reducing the\nemission threshold due to geometric field enhancement.13\nIn conclusion, excimer laser crystallized silicon thin\nfilms with higher crystalline volumes are achieved with an\nasymmetric profile laser pulse, compared with the conven-\ntional Gaussian profile pulse, at a given laser energy density.\nThe resultant crystalline films show increased surface rough-\nness believed to be arising from ablation at the increased\npeak energy during crystallization. An optimum shape of the\npulse must be possible to achieve by continuously varying\nthe two parameters of the pulse profile: length and peak off-\nset. The crystallization regime promises tunability for differ-\nent roughness requirements depending on the application,\nwhile reducing the thermal budget.\nThe authors thank J. M.
