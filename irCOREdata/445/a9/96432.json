With reference to the development of campaign finance \nstrategies in the US and the UK, it will aim to show that existing political circumstances and \ntechnology share a dialectic relationship when it comes to generating outcomes. The success \nof online fundraising in the US is certainly reforming political life, but is the product of long-\nstanding arrangements and beliefs which have catalyzed its impact. In contrast, in the United \nKingdom institutional arrangements have retarded the potential of the Web in this area.   \nKeywords: campaigns, elections, fundraising, online politics, United Kingdom, United States  \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 3 of 45\nThe analysis of any new technological phenomena invariably raises the question of \nontological primacy, and in particular the distinction between technological and sociological \ndeterminism. The development of the Internet and the ramifications it has for political \ncompetition are no exception to this rule. Two distinct camps \u2013 the \u201coptimists\u201d and the \n\u201cnormalisers\u201d \u2013 have emerged as the contemporary standard bearers for technological and \nsociological determinism respectively. The optimists focus on the technological attributes of \nthe Internet, in particular how it lowers barriers to participation and democratizes both access \nto information and the means of creating it. They assume that the characteristics of the \nInternet will lead to a reformation in political activity, sidelining existing elites and \nempowering those who are currently excluded from civic life (Morris, 1999; Rushkoff, 2003; \nTrippi, 2004). In contrast, normalisers argue that the Internet will not herald a major \nrearrangement of power and opportunity away from existing political elites. Instead they \nclaim those who currently control political life will be able to use their offline strengths to \ndominate the online world too (Margolis & Resnick, 2000; Norris, 2003; Resnick, 1998). \nEssentially the normalisers reverse the relationship that optimists perceive. The optimists \nbelieve that more equalitarian power structures will be created online and then come to impact \noffline politics. In contrast normalisers argue that, no matter what characteristics the Internet \nhas, they will be subsumed into offline social and power arrangements.  \nHowever, many studies have observed that the realities of online politics do not fit \nneatly into either the optimistic or the normalizing worldview (Gibson et al., 2005; \nLivingstone et al., 2005; Lusoli & Ward, 2005). These authors\u2019 findings point to a more \nnuanced reality and a far more complex relationship between new communication technology \nand the offline world. It seems far more likely that the development of Internet politics is \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 4 of 45\nbeing fuelled by a dialectic relationship, as both new technological affordances, and existing \nsocial and institutional arrangements mesh together to form unique and what must, by \ndefinition, be society specific outcomes (Anstead & Chadwick, 2008 - forthcoming). In short, \nthe Internet certainly has the capability to change political life. However, it cannot escape the \ncircumstances in which it is deployed, which can either catalyze or retard its potential. \nThe aim of this article will be to attempt to understand this relationship in the context \nof a specific example \u2013 the use of the Internet as a tool for political fundraising. In order to do \nthis, it will focus on two countries where the Internet has had a hugely differing level of \nimpact, the United States and the United Kingdom, and seek to explain how the specific \nhistorical, institutional and regulatory attributes of each political system have led to such \ndistinct outcomes, as well as assessing the changes that the Internet is driving. With this \napproach it will be possible to arrive at a truer understanding of the technological-societal \ndialectic.  \nFundraising Online in the US and the UK \nIn the United States, the impact of Internet fundraising has been one of the major \npolitical changes in recent years, and would seem to support the view that the Internet is \ncapable of having a revolutionary impact. With reference to the American experience, we can \nobserve at least four clear developments which the net is driving. Firstly, the Internet has \nplayed a significant role during a period of time when the total sums of money expended in \nAmerican politics have increased hugely. It has been argued, for example, that the 2008 \npresidential election will become the first billion dollar contest (Malbin & Cain, 2007: 4). \nThis sum would be more than double the totals contributed to candidates in 2004, and three \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 5 of 45\ntimes the amount raised in 2000 (Campaign Finance Institute, 2008). Secondly, the new \ntechnology seems to have re-balanced political competition, aiding those who might be \ntermed \u201coutsider\u201d candidates during primary competitions, at the expense of more established \nfigures. Examples of this pattern include John McCain\u2019s efforts in 2000, Howard Dean\u2019s run \nin 2004, and Barack Obama and Ron Paul\u2019s successes in 2008 (Bosman, 2007; Dodson & \nHammersley, 2003; Klotz, 2004; Schouten, 2006; Spark-Smith, 2007; Trippi, 2004). Thirdly, \nthe Internet is re-structuring the financial relationships between the parties. At least in recent \nhistory, the Democrats have been at a financial disadvantage against their Republican \nopponents. This was never more the case than during the 2000 election, when George W. \nBush was nearly able to outspend Al Gore twice over. However, in 2004, John Kerry came \nclose to achieving financial parity with Bush, largely thanks to his prowess as an Internet \nfundraiser (Dwyer et al., 2004). Fourthly, the Internet seems to be reshaping where political \nmoney is coming from. It has been claimed that, in the past, candidates and parties have \ntended to rely on large donations from a very small number of wealthy givers. The \ndevelopment of the Internet, it is argued, has created a form of \u201csmall dollar democracy\u201d, \nwhere vast numbers of contributors, each donating comparatively small sums of money, can \nwield huge influence (Bonin, 2007; Graf et al., 2006; Helman, 2007; Trippi, 2004).  \nThese observations raise a whole host of research questions about the impact that the \nInternet is having on American political life, such as whether the financial arms race will \ncontinue into future election cycles; if party elites will be washed away by the continuing \nsuccess of outsider candidates; and why do the Democrats seem to have an advantage online? \nHowever, one point is close to unarguable \u2013 the fundraising potential of the Internet is having \na profound impact on American political life.   \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 6 of 45\nIn contrast, it is almost impossible to find comparable examples of the Internet being \na significant fundraising tool in the United Kingdom (Jackson, 2006: 158). One example that \nstands out, if only because it is relatively unique, are a series of emails sent by Labour-\nsupporting journalist and author John O\u2019Farrell during the course of the 2005 general election. \nWithin a few hours these had raised some \u00a350,000. Over the next few days, the appeal went \non to generate a total of \u00a3110,000 (O'Farrell, 2007). However, in the general scheme of an \nelection where the party spent \u00a317 million, the money raised by O\u2019Farrell through his online \ndonations drive was relatively minimal. Furthermore, it was not a strategy which other parties \naimed to emulate over the course of the campaign (Jackson, 2006: 175) \nThis is not to suggest that British parties have neglected the fundraising potential of \nthe  Web altogether. All the major British parties, as well as a large number of the minor ones, \ndo currently have donate buttons on their national  Web site (Jackson, 2006: 169). However, \nthe relatively weak design of the sites, which have a tendency to be garish and unenticing \n(Nielson, 2008), and the low emphasis placed on fundraising, at least in comparison with the \nUS, is indicative of an activity that is not central to parties\u2019  Web strategies and where little \nsuccess has been achieved. It is certainly the case that online fundraising in the UK has \ngenerated far less popular interest than it has in the US.  \nIt cannot be argued that the lack of donations to political parties and candidates from \nBritish citizens is part of a wider mistrust of financial transactions online. In the UK, 60 per \ncent of people have engaged in some form of e-commerce (Office of National Statistics, \n2006), lagging only slightly behind the 66 per cent of Americans who shop online (Horrigan, \n2008). Although consumer and political financial transactions are not directly analogous, \nthere are some parallels. After all, many of the advantages of the Internet that make it perfect \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 7 of 45\nfor commerce \u2013 ease of use, convenience, rapidity of transaction, and the potential for low \noverheads \u2013 also make it ideally suited for political fundraising. For this reason, it is \nsurprising that British politicians have made no headway in emulating their American \ncounterparts. Furthermore, this difference between the British and the American experience \ncannot be explained through divergent levels of Internet adoption. In 2006, 69 out of every \nhundred Americans used the Internet, in comparison with 56 per cent of people in the United \nKingdom (ITU, 2006). While these figures do show a digital divide between the two \ncountries, it is also worth noting that the Internet was having a significant impact on political \nfundraising in the US before it achieved these levels of penetration. In 2003, for example, at \nexactly the point when Howard Dean was successfully using the Internet to fuel his candidacy \nfor the Democratic nomination, 56 per cent of Americans were online \u2013 a figure identical to \ncurrent British connectivity (ITU, 2003). \nThe British experience suggests that it would be wrong to see the Internet as \ninherently linked to either colossal fundraising or small dollar democracy. This is one area of \npolitical life therefore where we are unlikely to find a process of Americanization occurring \n(Kavanagh, 1995). What seems more appropriate is to note that the technological affordances \nof the Internet, when coupled with certain aspects of the American political system, have \ndemonstrated the potential to create very dramatic outcomes. In contrast, it seems that the \nenvironment in which British financial politics occurs is preventing the same technology \nhaving a comparable effect.  \nExplaining the Differences \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 8 of 45\nAttempting to explain the differing impact the Internet has had on fundraising in the \nUS and the UK requires us to adopt a two part explanatory structure. First order explanations \nare to be found in foundational elements of the political systems in the two countries \u2013 \nessentially the realm of political ideas and long-standing institutional norms. These \nexplanations are vital, as they frame the ideals and desires of both the political classes and \ncitizens. As a result, they also play a huge role in constructing the narrative through which \npolitical events and developments are understood. Second order explanations fall into the \narena we might term regulatory and legislative. Institutions have the potential to act as both \ncatalysts and barriers, and thus influence the strategies that political actors adopt to achieve \ntheir goals.  \nFoundational Explanations \nAmerican and British politics, despite similarities and much-shared heritage, clearly \ncontain many differing traditions. In the case of the US, two particular foundational \ncircumstances have undoubtedly been essential to fuelling the development of online \nfundraising in the form in which it has occurred \u2013 civic volunteerism and progressivism. \nCivic volunteerism, defined as willingness to engage in active citizenship through \noffering time and support for causes and organizations, has been central to American life \nsince the early years of the Republic, as de Tocqueville and Bryce both noted (Bryce, 1888; \nTocqueville, 1988). More recent studies have argued that Americans continue to have a higher \npropensity to be civically involved than their counterparts in other countries (Almond & \nVerba, 1963; Curtis et al., 1992). In the context of campaign finance, the American tradition \nof civic volunteerism is distinct from either the British tradition of the mass membership party \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 9 of 45\nor the European approach of state funding (Fisher & Clift, 2004: 683; Linton, 1994: chapter \n3), instead being based on the idea of contributing to the civic good. This leads to a very high \nproportion of Americans giving money during election cycles, at least in comparison with \nthose in other countries (Sorauf, 1992: 1). This tradition of supporting candidates and parties \nwith donations demarks one of the most distinctive elements of the American campaign \nfinance system, and has been essential to the relationship that has developed between Internet \ntechnology and political finance.   \nForged at the beginning of the twentieth century, the American progressive tradition \nhas also played a vital role in shaping the environment in which online fundraising has \noccurred. The concept of progressivism is notoriously hard to define, with it even being \ndebated whether it is possible to talk about a progressive ideology or era. This is due to the \nvarious, and occasionally contradictory, ideas the tradition drew upon (Filene, 1970). \nHowever, progressivism can be defined with reference to two concepts, which continue to \nreverberate in American politics. Firstly, its adherence to political optimism based on a belief \nin the power of activism (Hofstadter, 1955). Secondly, progressives argued that there were \ninherent dangers when elites controlled large concentrations of wealth and power. To realize \ntheir goals therefore, progressives sought to devolve political power directly to citizens, \nthrough institutions such as the direct primary and the recall election, which gave the \npopulace far greater control over office holders (Milkis & Mileur, 1999: 6-8). These twin \npillars of progressivism have become recurring elements in American politics, especially at \ntimes when the political classes have been mistrusted. Most notably, this occurred in the post-\nVietnam period, when the role of the direct primary was hugely expanded in an effort to give \nthe electorate a far greater impact on political outcomes (Finer, 1984). The rise of Internet \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 10 of 45\npolitics, and in particular the development of online fundraising strategies, can clearly be seen \nto fit into this tradition. Two aspects of Internet fundraising standout as having especial \nsignificance when viewed through the progressive prism.  \nFirstly, activism seems to play a central element in online fundraising. Speaking at a \nseminar in February 2004 former Dean campaign manager Zaphyr Teachout argued the \ninvolvement of activists had played a vital role in Dean\u2019s success in generating income online \n(Malbin et al., 2004). This argument was also later made by Republican political consultant \nPatrick Ruffini, who, citing the example of Howard Dean and Ron Paul\u2019s campaigns, claimed \nthat the most effective Internet fundraising occurs when candidates are surrounded by \n\u201cvibrant grassroots ecosystems\u201d, especially when these networks are based on blogs and \nmany-to-many communication (Ruffini, 2007).   \nRuffini\u2019s argument leads us to a second similarity between modern Internet \nfundraising and progressive ideology \u2013 a widespread belief that the Internet is removing \npower from old monied elites who have dominated political finance by virtue of their wealth. \nThis change is most evidenced in the idea of \u201csmall dollar democracy\u201d (Bonin, 2007; Graf et \nal., 2006). Howard Dean\u2019s campaign in particular was noted for the very large number of \ndonations it received of less than $200 (the largest amount that doesn\u2019t have to be individually \nitemized to the Federal Election Commission). The historical context and tradition of \nprogressivism offers an explanation as to why people believe that such a development would \nbe healthy for American democracy.  \nThe central point to understand here is that in recent electoral contests, and especially \nthose that have occurred since 2004, the Internet and its ability to help candidates raise \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 11 of 45\nfinancial contributions has become more than a convenient mechanism for quickly and \nefficiently raising revenue to compete with opponents. Additionally, the role played by the \nInternet has been assimilated into the much wider traditions of civic volunteerism and \nprogressivism within American politics.  \nIn contrast, in Britain at the beginning of the twentieth century, when American \nprogressivism was at its zenith, alternative political principles were being developed and \nenshrined which were to have an equally long-standing impact and continue to influence \nmodern fundraising strategies. In particular, the foundation and early development of the \nLabour Party embodied two particular ideals that were to have lasting ramifications on the \nBritish political landscape \u2013 the desirability of a role of trade unions in political life and a \npreference for mass membership parties. These arrangements offer an alternative to the more \nvolunteer-orientated, donation-driven model of American campaign finance. \nThe Labour Party was founded for the purpose of achieving working class \nrepresentation in the House of Commons and the majority of the impetus for its creation came \nfrom the trade union movement, with the aid of a number of socialist societies (Garner & \nKelly, 1998). At its foundation, the party sought to mobilize the financial muscle of the \nworking classes, through the unions, in order to give it the ability to compete with older, \ncadre-style parties. However, in order for the potential of the union link to be realized, Labour \nfirst had to overcome a serious legal challenge. This occurred in 1909, when the House of \nLords ruled that a railway porter, Walter Victor Osborne, should not be compelled to support \nthe party simply because he was a member of an affiliate, the Amalgamated Society of \nRailway Workers. The implications for Labour were huge, having the potential to strangle it \nat birth. It was only in 1913, when the Liberal government passed the Trade Unions Act, that \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 12 of 45\na compromise was reached. The Labour Party would be free to continue receive trade union \ndonations. However, unions would have to stage a ballot among their membership in order to \ngain permission to donate to a political party (Klarman, 1989; Pelling, 1982).  \nThe rules created by these political skirmishes in the early twentieth century have \nlargely remained in place to the present day, with one major amendment, which insisted that \nunions ballot their membership on political contributions every decade, being passed in 1984 \n(Towers, 1989). The defeat of the arguments contained in the Osborne Judgment and the \npassing of the 1913 Act successfully enshrined a central element of the British campaign \nfinance system. It did much to shape the nature of the trade union link and encouraged Labour \nto adopt a strongly collectivist approach to political organization, certainly in comparison with \nthe then dominant Liberal party (Klarman, 1989: 895 and 899). Instead of donations \npositively being given by individuals, trade unions gave block grants to Labour from their \npolitical funds. The defining characteristic of the attitude many union members held to \npolitical donations was, in reality, apathy (Klarman, 1989: 913-914). \nAdditionally, the 1913 Act and the rise of the Labour Party defined the modern party \nsystem and drew the financial battle lines of twentieth century British politics, forcing the \nConservatives to rely increasingly on support from the business community to fulfill their \nfinancial needs and counterbalance the resources Labour received from unions. Through \nsuccessfully employing these methods, they were able to compete with and even outstrip the \nfinancial capabilities of Labour (Pinto-Duschinsky, 1981: chapters 4 and 5). The respective \nsources of support for the two major parties also bolstered the ideological conflict between \nthem, with Labour seen as being dominated by the unions and the Conservatives argued to be \nunder the control of a business elite. Through political competition then, the involvement of \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 13 of 45\norganized labor and business in British political life became a firmly established practice. The \nreal losers in this new arrangement, which continued for much of the twentieth century and, to \na great extent, still continues, were the Liberals and their successor parties. Lacking \ninstitutional support, they rapidly became the poor relations of British politics (Pinto-\nDuschinsky, 1981: chapter 7).   \nThe second great engine of political finance established by both the left and right in \nthe early twentieth century was the mass-membership party. This model of political \norganization had profound implications for the way parties were funded and, as importantly, \nhow it was believed they should be funded. An inherent element of the structure of the mass \nmembership party is the subscription, which offers an alternative to donations. This financial \narrangement could be considered a more significant relationship between organization and \nsupporter than is created by a simple donations system (Duverger, 1964). A subscription \ndemonstrates a much more permanent affiliation between giver and receiver, as well as \nimplying a greater level of commitment to the ideology of the party or the class whose \ninterests it articulates. In return, subscribers can expect to reap the full benefits of \nmembership, whether they are solidary, purposive or ideological (Ware, 1996: 69-71).  \nIn common with other western countries in which parties have formal structures for \nsubscription, British parties have, in recent decades, suffered a dramatic decline in \nmembership (Dalton & Wattenberg, 2000; Webb, 2000). However, subscribers are still used \nto raise substantial sums of money. In 2005, for example, Labour was able to draw \u00a33.5 \nmillion from its membership, which amounted to a significant proportion of the \u00a317 million \nof electoral expenses the party incurred in the same year (Electoral Commission, 2006). \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 14 of 45\nThis reliance on the century old model of the membership party has at least two \nimpacts on British parties and their potential as online fundraisers. Firstly, by creating a more \npermanent relationship with their supporters, British parties are also effectively erecting a \nbarrier to political donations, as it makes it highly unlikely that non-members will give \n(Jackson, 2006: 164). Secondly, the guarantee of significant \u2013 if declining \u2013 sums from the \nparty membership offers an alternative revenue stream to donated monies. As a result, it is \nhardly surprising that much of the online work done by British parties has focused not on \nreaching out to new donors, but on engaging with their existing membership (Gibson et al., \n2005). This relationship and its solidity is especially important, as membership-based parties \nrequire far more permanent organizational arrangements, which have to be paid for \nthroughout the duration of a parliament. This need has historically differentiated British \nparties from their election-focused American counterparts, and goes some way to explaining \nthe persisting desirability of a membership-base, as it offers a constant stream of revenue \nwhich is less likely to fluctuate.  \nAlthough they shared common concerns about political finance (most notably the \npower of elite and moneyed interests), the ideologies that developed in the US and the UK in \nresponse to these worries at the start of the twentieth century were distinct. In the US, the \nlong-standing tradition of civic volunteerism, coupled with progressive ideas sought to bypass \nthe power of political and economic elites. In contrast, in the UK, collectivism and unified \nclass action was designated the most effective response, evident both in the trade union link \nand mass membership parties. However, a necessary by-product of these ideas (and the \nsuccessful responses to them by the Conservative Party) was the development of political \narrangements that downplayed the role of the individual in political life. This was to have \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 15 of 45\nhuge ramifications into the present day, as these foundational circumstances have created a \nform of path dependency, leading to contemporary outcomes (Fisher & Clift, 2004: 680). \nUltimately, then, they play a huge role in the nature and success of online fundraising across \ndiffering societies.   \nRegulatory and Legislative Explanations \nHistorically, on both sides of the Atlantic, regulation and the passing of legislation on \ncampaign finance has proved a particularly fraught and controversial area of discussion, with \ncampaign finance reform a notoriously difficult area to legislate in. This should not surprise \nus; after all, campaign finance is an area of civic activity that is regulated by the very same \npeople whose livelihoods and ambitions are to be most impacted by it \u2013 namely, office-\nseeking politicians. This has, at various times during American and British history, led to \nperiods where campaign finance has been hotly debated, but little action has been taken, with \ndeadlock being the only outcome. It is no coincidence that when reforms have been \nimplemented, it has followed events that have shaken the public\u2019s confidence in the political \nclasses.  \nThe Development of the Campaign Finance Regulation in the US \nOne important consequence of the progressive tradition in American politics was a \ndesire to legislate on campaign finance issues by those with a reformist agenda, among whom \nthere was a belief that the problems of campaign finance could be solved through regulatory \nmechanisms. For this reason, campaign finance was a much more significant legislative issue \nin the US than it ever was in the UK.  \nThe progressive era. \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 16 of 45\nGenuine attempts to offer root and branch reform of the campaign finance system \ncan be traced to the beginning of the twentieth century. Although the progressive agenda in \nthis area was not implemented in full, the legislation that it instigated would be the basis for \ncampaign regulation in the United States until the early seventies. Additionally, the ideas \nadvocated by the progressives would have an impact into the present and play a significant \nrole in framing all future debates on campaign finance.  \nThis period saw a hugely significant principle enshrined in legislation, which was to \nhave a vast long-term significance and set the American system apart from the model adopted \nin the UK. The Tillman Act of 1907 outlawed electoral contributions from corporations and \nbanks. This legislation established a significant element of the American campaign finance \nsystem \u2013 namely, the rejection of institutional donations (Corrado, 1997: 27-28; Zardkoohi, \n1985). This principle was further extended in 1943, by the War Labor Disputes Act, which \nimposed an electoral contributions ban on trade unions, similar to that which the Tillman Act \nhad imposed on corporations (this measure was originally intended to last until the end of the \nconflict, but was made permanent in 1946). Although both corporations and labor unions do \nplay a significant role in the financial aspects of American political life through various \ninstitutional mechanisms, these two pieces of legislation ensured that they were expressly \nexcluded from giving directly to candidates and parties, which establishes a vast and \nsignificant distinction from the UK. \nThe Federal Election Campaign Act era. \nThe desire to regulate campaign finance in the United States in the latter part of the \ntwentieth century was driven by both social and technological change. Perhaps the most \nobvious factor influencing the evolution of campaign finance in the immediate post-war \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 17 of 45\nperiod was the erosion of the city-based party machines. These organizations had once been \ncentral to electoral power-broking and fundraising. However, by the late sixties the city \nmachine was near to extinct, destroyed by societal change and the evolution of American life. \nIn the place of the machines and the parties, politics started to refocus on the candidates \nseeking office. Instructively for anyone studying the Internet, at least one element of this \nchange was technological in nature. The rise of television led to a far greater focus on the \ncandidate and a hugely increased role for advertising in election campaigning. As a result, \nelectoral costs were spiraling by the late sixties. There was a fifty per cent increase in election \nexpenditure between 1964 and 1968 alone (Alexander, 1992: 88). However, candidates, \ndeprived of the fundraising capabilities of effective party machines, struggled to meet the \ndemands created by the evolving electoral environment. \nThe response to this problem was legislative, and took the form of the Federal \nElection Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971. The Act essentially contained three elements: it \nlimited the amount of personal wealth candidates could contribute to their own campaign; it \ncreated a requirement for full and publicly available disclosure of election receipts and \nexpenses, and, in response to the rising cost of publicity, it established specific limits on \nmedia expenditure \u2013 defined as radio, television, newspapers, magazine, and automated \ntelephone systems (Corrado, 1997: 29 and 52; Sorauf, 1992: 7-9). This latter element of the \nbill had two distinct parts \u2013 firstly, the candidates could only spend $50,000 or $0.10 per \neligible voter in an election, whichever was the greater amount. Additionally, a maximum of \n60 per cent of a candidate\u2019s total expenditure could be used to purchase television or radio \nadvertising. These regulations were to cover the entire period of the primary and the general \nelection, as well as any runoff or special elections.  \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 18 of 45\nThe Federal Election Campaign Act was never intended as a radical document. \nRather, it was designed to retain the principles established in the pre-existing regulation, but \nto update them for the televisual, candidate-centered age. However, the Act was only to be \nused in one election. Events were very soon to take a dramatic twist and irrevocably alter the \ncampaign finance landscape in the United States. The Watergate scandal and the fact that the \ninvestigation into Nixon\u2019s wrongdoings had led to serious concerns about the propriety of his \ncampaign\u2019s sources of income, made far more radical reforms politically viable. The end \nresult of this was the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendment (FECA) of 1974. This has \nbeen seen as the most significant piece of campaign finance legislation ever passed in the US \n(Corrado, 1997: 32 and 53; Sorauf, 1992: 7-9). This claim is not without justification. Not \nonly did it seek to fix the problems that its proponents argued were evident in the old regime, \nand add extra requirements and restrictions; it also sought to enshrine certain values \u2013 in \nparticular a preference for small donors over large givers \u2013 into the regulatory framework. \nBroadly, the amended FECA regime can be divided into four elements: reporting \nrequirements, spending caps, donations caps and public subsidy.  \nReporting requirements were tightened considerably under the Act. The format of \naccounts was standardized and time limits were imposed to ensure their prompt submission, \nwhile candidates were required to create a single committee, through which all their finances \nmust be managed (in the past it had been perfectly possible for candidates to funnel monies \nthrough multiple committees). Most crucially of all, a new bipartisan body \u2013 the Federal \nElection Commission (the FEC) \u2013 was established to gather and hold this data, and enforce \ncampaign finance regulations. The FEC was to have genuine power to hold candidates to \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 19 of 45\naccount and to punish wrongdoing. Indeed, the creation of the FEC gave the United States the \nlargest campaign finance bureaucracy system in the world (Sorauf, 1992: 9).  \nThe media-based spending caps of the 1971 Act were replaced with total expenditure \ncaps, which applied to all federal elections. In Senate contests, the total expenditure per \ncandidate was permitted to be the greater sum of $100,000 or $0.08 per voting-age member of \nthe population for the primary election, and then the greater amount of $150,000 or $0.12 per \nvoting age citizen in the general election. For House candidates, the limit was set at the \ngreater sum of $150,000 or $0.12 in each cycle. Expenditure in presidential elections was also \ncapped, with simple limits - $10m for the primary contest and $20m for the general election. \nAll of the ceilings were indexed to inflation. Additionally, candidates were allowed to spend \nan extra 20 per cent of their budget total on fundraising.  \nThe reason for this last provision was that the Act also imposed limits on donation, \nand it was appreciated that, now having to rely on smaller donations, candidates would have \nto use greater amounts of energy and resources to increase the number of people in their \nfundraising base. The amendment Act retained the 1971 Act\u2019s limits on contributions by \ncandidates to their own campaigns, as well as capping all other donations. Individuals were \npermitted to give a maximum of $1000 to a campaign for any primary, runoff or election. An \nindividual was limited to a total of $25,000 electoral contributions per annum. Furthermore, \nPolitical Action Committee contributions were capped at $5,000 per campaign per year.  \nFinally, and perhaps most ground-breaking of all, the Act introduced public funding \nfor presidential elections. This funding took two forms. The general election itself was funded \nby a simple grant of $20m, index linked to inflation. This money was, realistically, available \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 20 of 45\nto candidates from the two major parties, as the ability to gain full-funds was derived from \nperformance during previous elections. However, the grant was only given on the condition \nthat there were no attempts to raise private money for campaigning. The public funding \narrangements for the primary competition was more complex, and were based on the principle \nof the public purse matching funds raised by the candidates from small contributors. In order \nto qualify, candidates had to raise $5,000 in contributions of less than $250 in at least twenty \nstates. If these criteria were met, the government would match, dollar-for-dollar, the first $250 \nof each donation made to candidates. Candidates could claim up to $5m in this way \u2013 that is, \nhalf of their spending limit. The logic of the regulation was clear. Spending limits and public \nfinance were conceived to function in tandem, with the maximum public funding available \nbeing related to the overall spending limit in the primary competition. The aim of the public \nsubsidy was to encourage candidate to gather their contributions in small donations, which \nwere regarded as preferable to large contributions.  \nHow candidates would have adapted to the stringent regulatory framework \nestablished by FECA in its 1974 form is one of the great \u201cwhat if?\u201d questions of American \npolitics. The Act was never used in the form it was drafted in a presidential election cycle. \nThe reason for this was that some of its most significant elements were deemed \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Buckley vs. Valeo (US Supreme Court, 1976), a \nruling which Sarauf argues \u201cgutted\u201d FECA (Sorauf, 1992: 211). Firstly, spending caps were \ndeemed unconstitutional, on the grounds that they impinged the First Amendment, which \nguaranteed freedom of speech. As importantly, the ruling rejected the definition of electoral \ncampaign spending used in FECA, which was expenditure designed to influence elections. \nThis, the Supreme Court argued, was too vague and would actually discourage people from \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 21 of 45\nengaging in political activity that should be legal and protected by the constitution. Instead, \nthe Supreme Court suggested a definition of \u201cexpress advocacy\u201d, where the use of certain \n\u201cmagic words\u201d, such as \u201cvote\u201d, and \u201celect\u201d would be used to indicate electoral campaigning \n(Malbin, 2006a: 5).  \nHowever, even in its modified form, FECA was powerful enough to dramatically \nalter the fundraising methods employed by the parties. Two strategies are worthy of particular \nnote: direct mail campaigns and bundling. As they were unable to raise large sums from \nindividual donations, candidates and parties were forced to do a great deal of work developing \nthe technology and infrastructure to undertake massive direct mailing operations. As a result, \ncampaigns became adept at tailoring their message to individual voters, hoping to entice them \nto make political contributions (Adamany, 1986; Berman, 1986). Secondly, to cope with the \nnewly introduced donation limits, parties encouraged supporters to \u201cbundle\u201d contributions. \nEssentially, this required prominent and powerful individuals \u2013 often businessmen and \nwomen, or campaigners \u2013 to construct a network amongst their professional, political and \nsocial acquaintances, all of whom would give donations to a political candidate or party. \nThus, completely legally, a single individual could marshal and organize donations running \ninto tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars (Sorauf, 1992: 52-53, 124-130). This \npractice continues today. In the 2000 Presidential election, George Bush deemed activists who \nwere able to bundle more than $100,000 for his campaign as \u201cPioneers\u201d. In the 2004 election \nhe created two new categories \u2013 \u201cRangers\u201d who each bundled $200,000 and \u201cSuper-Rangers\u201d \nwho each bundled $300,000 (Drinkard & McQuillan, 2003). In 2007, 233 Hillary Clinton \nbundlers who each raised more than $100,000 were dubbed \u201cHillraisers\u201d (Kirkpatrick, 2007).  \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 22 of 45\nThe FECA period still offers much of the fundamental framework of the American \ncampaign finance regime. Perhaps, most importantly though, it illustrated the power of the \nSupreme Court, and made the constitutional doctrine that campaign expenditure is equated to \nfree speech a political orthodoxy. As a result, the idea of Congress legislating to impose \nspending caps on candidates in elections became unthinkable, short of a constitutional \namendment. Given the great difficulty, illustrated throughout the history of campaign finance \nreform, of creating even a simple majority for change, this is nearly impossible to imagine.  \nThe Bipartisan Campaign Finance Act: reform revisited. \nBy the mid-nineties, even judged against the limited regulatory framework offered \nby the post-Buckley vs.Valeo incarnation of FECA, the regulatory system was failing. The \nreason for this was a loophole constructed from two elements of the original legislation. \nFirstly, the Act allowed for unlimited sums of money to be given to state parties for \norganizational developmental. The original logic behind this clause was that parties were a \nvital element in civic society, and that to deprive them of funds would prevent them fulfilling \ntheir role as mobilizes and educators of the electorate. However, by the nineties, party \nstrategists had started to link this provision with the \u201cexpress advocacy\u201d test laid out by the \nSupreme Court. This reading of the law gave parties the ability to spend vast sums of money \non election campaigns without breaking any rules (Franz et al., 2006: 143-144; Malbin, \n2006b: 6). This situation created a paradox \u2013 the weaknesses of FECA, once lauded as the \nmost radical campaign finance reform Act passed in American history, had, by the mid-\nnineties, been exploited to such an extent that the regulatory regime had been completely \nundermined. The parties were now able to gather unlimited \u201csoft money\u201d contributions (that \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 23 of 45\nis, donations that are given and spent outside the regulatory environment) from individuals, \ncorporations and trade unions. \nThe dramatic failure of the FECA regime in this respect and runaway soft-money \ndonations to parties led to renewed calls for reform (Malbin, 2006b: 6). The Bi-Partisan \nCampaign Finance Act, sometimes referred to by the name of its co-sponsors, Senators John \nMcCain and Russ Feingold, was, in many ways, an attempt to re-establish a fundamental \nprinciples of the 1974 Act \u2013 namely that contributions to both candidates and parties should \nbe regulated and limited. In trying to achieve this goal, McCain-Feingold gave with one hand \nand took with the other. In the debit column, it prevented parties from harvesting \u201csoft \ncontributions\u201d for campaigning in Federal Elections. As a result of this measure, parties were \ndeeply fearful of a financial shortfall that they would be unable to make up in \u201chard money\u201d \ncontributions \u2013 that is, donations that are regulated by federal law. To counteract this fear, \nBCRA increased federal donation caps, which had remained unchanged since 1974 (indeed, \nsince the limits imposed by FECA were not indexed to prices, donations caps had been \ndeclining in size in real terms). It was widely predicted that both candidates and parties could \nhope to raise greater sums from individual donors who had the resources to give to the legal \nmaximum than had been the case in previous election cycles. However, this did not placate \neveryone. Many still claimed that parties, denied access to soft money, would still be unable \nto make up the short-fall in their funds (Ansolabehere & Snyder, 2000; Malbin, 2006b: 1-4).  \nIn many ways, the development of the Internet as a serious fundraising tool and the \nimpact of BPCR were contemporaneous. As well as arguably being the first online election, \n2004 was also the first BPCR election. Simultaneously to both of these developments, \ncampaign fundraising in American politics has massively increased, both in rate and scale, as \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 24 of 45\nevidenced by the 2004 and 2008 presidential contests. Arguably, BPCR\u2019s central objective \u2013 \nto empower individual donors and undermine soft money \u2013 is perfectly aligned with the \npotential of the Internet.    \nThe Development of the Campaign Finance System in the UK \nHistorically, the impulse to reform campaign finance has played a far lesser role in \nBritish political discourse than it has on the other side of the Atlantic. Certainly the United \nKingdom has taken a far more laissez faire stand to campaign finance (Fisher & Clift, 2004: \n677). This approach is evidenced by the late development of public reporting of political \ndonations and expenditure, for example. The US has aspired to transparency since the early \ntwentieth century and now has the most effective reporting system of anywhere in the world. \nThe UK only got such an arrangement in 2000, and even then, it collated far less information \nthan the American model.  \nThis is not to suggest that campaign finance has not been discussed and solutions \nproposed to perceived problems. Two recurring issues are cited with political finance in \nBritain. Firstly, it is argued that parties are perennially short of necessary financial resources, \nto the extent that they are unable to fulfill their civic role (Phillips, 2007: 1-2). Secondly, it is \nclaimed that political financial scandals, such as the so-called cash for honors affair in 2006-\n2007 or Peter Hain\u2019s failure to adequately report donations to his deputy leadership campaign \nin 2007 undermine the public\u2019s confidence in the political classes (BBC Online, 2007; Grice, \n2008). Despite this though, the issue has never gained the same ideological charge that it \ncarries in the United States, possibly because the terms of the debate are so fixed in \nlongstanding political arrangements. However, two significant pieces of legislation stand out \nas having particular impact.  \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 25 of 45\nRegulating the constituencies. \nThe Illegal and Corrupt Practices (Prevention) Act of 1883 was, for nearly 120 years, \nalbeit with some amendment, the single most important piece of legislation concerning \ncampaign finance regulation on the British statute books, and still provides the foundations \nfor a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in place. The Act was drafted in the \naftermath of the 1880 election. In modern British politics, there is much talk of \u201crun-away\u201d \nelection expenditure. However, in real terms, the 1880 election is probably the most \nexpensive ever fought, costing \u00a32.5 million. At 2005 values, that amounts to more than \u00a3165 \nmillion (figure derived from Pinto-Duschinsky, 1981: 28). The actual 2005 election cost the \nthree major parties just over \u00a340 million (Electoral Commission, 2006). The profligate \nexpenditure during this period of British politics can be explained by the interaction of two \ndistinct circumstances. Firstly, elections occurred within a completely unregulated campaign \nfinance system. Secondly, the latter half of the nineteenth century saw a huge increase in \npolitical competitiveness across the country, fuelled by the rise of political parties and the \nextension of the franchise. Fifty years before, many seats would have been uncontested, \nkeeping costs down. By 1880, only seventeen per cent of seats were uncontested (Pinto-\nDushinsky, 1981: 28). Clearly this funding situation was not sustainable in the long term.    \nThe result of these events was the 1883 Act, which directly addressed the issue of \nexpanding expenditure by imposing limits on candidate\u2019s campaign spending in the \nconstituency where they were running. To ensure these limits were adhered to, the Act also \nmade the appointment of an electoral agent, with responsibility for recording and reporting \ncampaign donations and expenditure, compulsory (Linton, 1994: 5-6). Measured by overall \nelection expenditure, the Act was a success. The 1885 election cost a third less than the 1880 \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 26 of 45\ncontest. The cost of elections \u2013 in real terms \u2013 was never again to reach the extremes of spring \n1880.  \nThis Victorian attempt at regulating British political finance enshrined a very \nfundamental and recurring principle, which significantly differentiated British rules from \nthose in the United States. While American legislators found it near-impossible to introduce \nspending caps, the 1883 Act proved that, within a British political framework, such spending \nlimits were practicable, effective, and persistent. The modern version of this idea was laid out \nin the Representation of the People Act (1983), which legislated that spending limits should \nbroadly go up in line with inflation, with precise recommendations for the caps being made by \nthe Electoral Commission. The tool for doing this would be a two stage formula, combining a \nuniversally applied constituency spending cap and a sum of money per voter living in the \nelectoral unit. In the 2005 general election, the flat spending limit was \u00a37,150 per \nconstituency, plus an additional 5 pence per voter in more urban, borough constituencies or 7 \npence per voter in more rural, county constituencies (Garner & Kelly, 1998: 2 and 6). Such \nrestrictions would be unthinkable in the US.  \nDespite the success of the 1883 legislation, at least on its own terms, changes to the \nregime governing the financial aspects of politics were limited throughout the twentieth \ncentury. The Illegal and Corrupt Practices (Prevention) Act has been modified since it was \noriginally passed by subsequent pieces of legislation, drafted in response to specific \ncircumstances. For example, the original Act did not regulate non-candidates in an election \nwho might campaign against people running for office, a loophole exploited by the \nsuffragettes. The 1918 Representation of the People Act rectified this situation, making it \nillegal to campaign against candidates (Linton, 1994: 6). However, major reform, and in \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 27 of 45\nparticular any kind of regulation at the national level, looked unlikely to occur, as any \nsuggestions seemed to advantage or disadvantage of one of the major parties. In 1929, Labour \nproposed an Electoral Reform Act containing measures that would have greatly disadvantaged \nthe Conservatives, who, in response, proposed a set of reforms that would have hurt Labour. \nUltimately no changes occurred. Likewise, in 1974, Labour established the Houghton \nCommittee, which, two years later, stated it was in favor of state aid for political parties. \nHowever, Labour\u2019s loss of power in 1979 prevented this policy being instigated.  \nPPERA: time for national regulation? \nThe deadlock in campaign finance legislation was broken by the Labour Party\u2019s \nelectoral victory in 1997. In part, this victory was achieved on the back of concern about \nstandards in public life during the previous Conservative government\u2019s tenure, with so-called \n\u201csleaze\u201d scandals proving to be highly damaging. This concern was further enhanced by \nLabour\u2019s own party funding scandal, involving a donation from Formula One Supremo \nBernie Eccelston and a decision to exempt motor racing from a proposed ban on tobacco \nadvertising (Scarrow, 2004: 668). \nThese events resulted in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendum Act (2000). \nThis piece of legislation would address what had become the major weakness of the existing \nregulatory framework. At the time the 1883 Act was passed, the primary concern of \nlawmakers was local politics, being fought out in the constituencies. However, over the \nfollowing decades, political power and resources became increasingly centralized, and \nnational parties grew hugely in significance. This is not to suggest that local campaigning and \nfundraising became wholly insignificant (on this issue, see Johnson & Pattie, 2007). However, \nit is clear that expansion of central parties, coupled with the deadlock in the reform process, \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 28 of 45\nleft a significant \u2013 and, throughout the twentieth century, expanding \u2013 proportion of political \nlife almost completely unregulated and lacking in transparency of any kind (Grant, 2005: \n381).  \nPPERA has been termed the most dramatic development in British campaign finance \nregulation since the 1883 Act (Fisher, 2002: 1). The Act established the first national \ncampaign spending limits, which were calculated based on the number of seats that a party \nwas running in. In 2005, this limit was set at \u00a330,000 for every constituency a party was \ncontesting. As a result, the maximum potential expenditure was some \u00a318.8 million (Garner \n& Kelly, 1998: 6). Additionally, it modestly increased the level of state funding available to \npolitical actors seeking office, and clarified the role to be played by third-party actors in \nelectoral competition. Finally, the Act instigated the first national reporting criteria, wherein \nparties would have to notify the Electoral Commission of their income and expenditure in \nquarterly reports. They would also have to provide more detailed and frequent information \nduring an election period (HM Government, 2000).  \nHowever, PPERA is as interesting for what it did not include. Two particular \nomissions stand out as being significant. Firstly, the Neill committee, around whose proposals \nPPERA was originally drafted, recommended a system of matching funds from the public \npurse for small donations. This was rejected by the government as being too expensive and \nbecause it was claimed such a measure would amount to public funding via the backdoor. \nMore cynically, it has been argued that this rejection in fact occurred because Labour would \ndo less well out of such a system than would their opponents (Grant, 2005: 381-382).  \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 29 of 45\nThe second significant omission in PPERA was the lack of any attempt at instigating \ndonation caps, despite the fact that a number of huge donations to both major parties have \nbeen a source of some public concern, especially in the period before general elections. \nHowever, it is also important to note just how reliant political parties are on large donations, \neither from individuals and organizations. It has been estimated that a cap on donations in the \nUnited Kingdom of \u00a35000 (roughly equal to five times the increased BPCR cap imposed in \nthe US) would deprive parties of 90 per cent of their current income (Grant, 2005: 390). This \nis particularly true of individual donations, which have grown in significance as parties\u2019 \ntraditional sources of income \u2013 most notably, membership subscriptions and, in the case of \nLabour, trade union levies \u2013 have declined.        \nMore generally (and although PPERA is undoubtedly a break from the past and the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s laissez faire approach to campaign finance), PPERA, unlike BPCR, did \nnothing to attack any streams of revenue on which the parties had come to rely \u2013 not \nindividual donors, corporations or trade unions. As a result the system PPERA instigated did \nnot create the same level of disruption to the campaign finance system in the UK as did BPCR \nto the American system, and parties were not required to rethink or hugely alter their political \nfundraising strategies. The essential elements of the campaign finance system remained \nundisturbed. Additionally, by not including the possibility of matching public monies for \nsmall donors, the Act did not encourage parties to look for new and potentially lucrative \nsources of revenue from large numbers of citizens giving small amounts of money.  \nAmerican and British campaign finance regulation and the Internet \nThis regulatory history leads us to a number of broad conclusions about the \nfundamental differences between the British and American campaign finance systems, all of \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 30 of 45\nwhich have played a role in shaping the nature of online fundraising in the two countries. \nBroadly, we can focus on three distinctions, which encourage online fundraising in the US \nand discourage it in the UK: differing attitudes to institutional and individual giving; the \nAmerican reliance on donation caps in comparison with the British tradition of spending caps; \nand the lack of any kind of systematic public funding in the United Kingdom. \nThe rejection of institutional funding by Americans occurred very early in the \nprogressive period. Although the legislation is far from fully effective, and PACs and soft \nmoney loopholes still allowed for such donations, there is a far greater cultural antipathy in \nAmerican politics to institutional giving. In contrast, both major British parties relied on \ninstitutional donations for the most part of the twentieth century, to the extent that the process \nbecame enshrined in the party system. It continues to make up a significant element of party \nincome today. In summer 2007, for example, when it was suspected that Prime Minister \nGordon Brown was going to call an early election, a number of trade union leaders were able \nto offer a pledge that they would finance the campaign if it were required (BBC Online, \n2007). American law would simply not permit such a statement. Instead, American politicians \nlargely have to rely on individual donors giving money to their campaigns. Furthermore, both \nFECA and BPCR have enshrined this principle in legislation. Clearly, this form of giving is \nmuch more conducive to the use of the Internet. In contrast, in the British example, the \ntechnology is largely superfluous to the fundraising requirements of parties.  \nThe same can be said of the large individual donations that are available to parties in \nthe United Kingdom. Such donations, which have run into millions of pounds, negate the \nneed to use the Internet. When parties are able and legally allowed to raise such huge sums of \nmoney from an individual, then Internet campaigning becomes, with its requirement to \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 31 of 45\nexpend energy and resources reaching out to vast numbers of small donors, a relatively less \nattractive option. In the US, even \u201clarge donors\u201d contributing to candidates (and, since BPCR, \nto parties) still give a relatively modest sum, capped at $2000 and linked to inflation by the \n2002 legislation. It is still conceivable to imagine such sums being given over the Internet. It \nis certainly likely that smaller sums \u2013 the so-called $50 donations \u2013 are given online. Even if \nthe extent and significance of these contributions is perhaps not as one-sided as it has been \npresented, it is undoubtedly the case that they have an expanded role in American politics, and \nthe Internet is playing a part, and probably a decisive one, in creating this situation.  \nAlthough the impact of the Act is hard to quantify, it seems likely that the rise of \nsmall dollar online giving in the United States has also been catalyzed by the implementation \nof BPCR. Parties have not completely renounced soft money, but have instead found \nalternative mechanisms for deploying these donations, most infamously 527 groups (so-\ntermed because of the code in the US tax statute that regulates them). Although these \norganizations are in theory completely separate from political parties, they are in reality \nclosely linked, especially through the people they employ (Boatright, 2007; Weissman & \nHassan, 2006). However, the post-BPCR period has also seen massively increased hard \nmoney giving, the growing significance of individual donors, and an increase in small dollar \ngiving. By this measure, the Act has certainly achieved many of its aims, aided by the \ndevelopment of the Internet.  \nThe tradition of donation limits as the primary regulatory tool in the US has had \nother significant impacts. Post-FECA, the strategies that parties and candidates developed in \norder to respond to only being able to gather limited donations from individuals have also \nhelped them adapt to the Internet age. Direct mail ensured that American campaigns became \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 32 of 45\nvery effective at managing and organizing information and using computer technology. \nAdditionally, direct mail taught fundraisers to develop a relationship with individual \ncontributors and tailor their messages toward them. This is something that has been replicated \nonline (Howard, 2006: 1-2). Bundling, albeit on a narrow and exclusive scale, pointed \ntowards the power of networked funding, as it relied on individuals, who were acting with a \nmeasure of independence from campaigns in order to raise funds. In many ways, that model \ncan be seen as a primitive version of the technique that was to be employed by bloggers and \nonline activists. \nIn contrast, the British regulatory approach of employing spending caps, first in the \nconstituencies and more recently nationally, seems to have stunted the need of parties to \ndevelop alternative sources of revenue. This is primarily because it prevents a campaign \nfinance \u201carms race\u201d of the sort seen in the US. British politicians from major parties have \nlittle fear that their opponents will be able to out fundraise them. In the lexicon of Katz and \nMair, the system is cartelized by spending limits, which reduces the level of competition \nmassively (Katz & Mair, 1995). While UK parties will always aspire to generate extra \nincome, this regulatory framework ensures that they lack the same level of motivation as their \nUS counterparts.  \nFinally, a system of matching funds, as created by FECA in the US, will do much to \nencourage candidates to seek small donations, as it effectively increases their relative value \nvia the public purse. The lack of any such incentive in the United Kingdom ensures that small \ndonations are not favored over larger contributions. However, it should also be noted that the \nAmerican matching funds system in the primary season is now in some difficulties (Malbin, \n2006a). In particular, the rising level of campaign fundraising has made it possible for certain \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 33 of 45\nparticularly successful candidates to opt out of matching funds and, as a result, the spending \nlimits it imposes on them. This was first apparent in the 2000 presidential election, when \nGeorge Bush chose not to take public support. John Kerry and Howard Dean then followed \nthis approach in the 2004 contest.  \nThis is the perhaps the clearest example of the technology-institutional arrangement \ndialectic at work. While various institutions have made the Internet a powerful tool for \nAmerican politicians, the very success of online fundraising is dismantling some elements of \nthe American campaign finance system. It is now questionable whether a candidate can \nactually accept public funds and still be considered a serious contender for the nomination. \nShort of full scale reform, the public funding element of the presidential primary system \nseems like it is now a defunct institution. Furthermore, these developments look set to \ncontinue: it now seems that the fundraising prowess of certain candidates will soon endanger \npublic funding for the presidential election itself (Washington Post, 2008).   \nConclusion \nThe above discussion seems to point to a very complex relationship between, on the \none hand, pre-existing political arrangements, norms and regulations, and, on the other hand, \nthe technological affordances of the Internet. If examined in isolation, the experience of the \nUnited States and the dramatic changes seemingly being wrought by the net might seem to \nsuggest the optimists were correct \u2013 the Internet is reforming political institutions, at least in \nthe arena of campaign finance. However, such an approach negates the role played by the \nsame institutions and norms in facilitating those changes in the first place.  \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 34 of 45\nIn part, explanations for the success of online fundraising in the US can be found in \nthe realm of political ideas, and in particular the positive view the American population takes \nof civic volunteerism and the progressive tradition. Additionally, the regulatory framework \nconstructed in the US over the past century, culminating in BPCR in 2002, has created a \nsituation where political actors have both the opportunity and motivation to develop their \ncapabilities as online fundraisers. Especially since the 2000 election cycle, this has created a \nfinancial \u201carms race\u201d, where office seekers have attempted to out raise each other in order to \nremain politically viable. This process has reached its dramatic conclusion (at least thus far) in \nthe Democratic primary contest, with candidates raising sums of money which would have \nseemed unimaginable only a few years ago.  \nThe complex relationship between technology and political institutions is further \ndemonstrated by the experience of the United Kingdom. In Britain, it seems that both \ninstitutional norms and regulations have conspired to undermine the potential of the Internet \nas a fundraising tool. Parties have had little opportunity and limited incentive to change their \nexisting revenue streams in recent decades. They are still able to rely on large donation, from \nindividuals, unions or corporations. Although Britain has recently seen a significant piece of \ncampaign finance legislation passed, PPERA has, by failing to limit large donations or \nincentivize small giving, not created the same disruption of pre-existing revenue streams that \nBPCR did in the US. Furthermore, the imposition of a national spending cap under the Act \nmay actually ensure that the funding arrangements employed by British parties become \ncartelized, preventing a funding arms race and limiting competitive pressures within the party \nsystem which might drive the development of an effective Internet donation base. \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 35 of 45\nIt is important to appreciate that the political traditions and regulatory frameworks in \nboth countries will continue to impact the future of campaign finance, and it is unlikely that \nthe patterns of path dependency will be broken. For example, it is no coincidence that while \nthere is concern in Britain about the funding of political parties, there are few advocates of an \nInternet driven, American-style small dollar revolution. Instead the default position of British \nreformers has tended to be the advocacy of the European model of state funding (for example \nLinton, 1994; Power Commission, 2006). However, any such proposal, where it ever to be \ninstigated, would, by abetting the process of cartelization between the parties and making \nsmall individual donations less significant, be likely to bolster many of the existing \ncharacteristics of the British campaign finance settlement, rather than offset them. As a result, \nit is not only the case that Internet fundraising is currently less relevant in the UK than in the \nUS; it also looks likely that the potential direction of future reform will ensure this remains \ntrue. \n \n \n  \nCampaign Finance in the US and the UK Page 36 of 45\nBibliography \nAdamany, D.
