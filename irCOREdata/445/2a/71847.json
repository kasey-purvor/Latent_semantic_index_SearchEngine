They are kinds of people studied by the human sciences. \u2018Human kind\u2019 is a term \nchosen by Hacking to contrast with \u2018natural kind\u2019. Natural kinds are the kinds dealt with by the \nnatural sciences. Traditional examples include gold, electrons, and tigers.  \nHacking\u2019s central claim is that human kinds and natural kinds are fundamentally distinct \n([1986], [1988], [1992], [1995a], [1995b]). If Hacking is right, this has profound implications for the \nquestion of whether the human sciences are fundamentally like, or unlike, the natural sciences. \nNatural kinds are often considered to feature in natural laws. Many have also considered natural \nkinds to play a key role in explanations and in supporting inductive inferences.\n[1]\n As such, if human \nkinds cannot be natural kinds, this may indicate that laws and explanations will take different forms \nin the natural and human sciences. \nSince developing the arguments that are discussed here, Hacking seems to have changed tack \nand, although he does not give reasons for rejecting his earlier work, Chapter Four of his The Social \nConstruction of What? ([2000]) discusses the possibility that at least some human kinds (called \n\u2018interactive kinds\u2019 in this book) are also natural kinds. Hacking discusses autism as a possible \nexample. Here I am only concerned with Hacking\u2019s earlier work. His argument that human kinds \ncannot be natural kinds has been influential, so far as I know it as yet stands unrefuted and, if sound, \nit has radical implications for the philosophy of the human sciences. \nHacking\u2019s argument that human kinds cannot be natural kinds rests on the claim that \nclassifying and describing human kinds results in feedback which alters the very kinds under study. \nIn a nutshell, homosexuals respond to being studied, spiders and copper do not. The resulting \nfeedback means that human kinds have histories totally unlike the histories of natural kinds. Thus, \nHacking concludes, human kinds cannot be natural kinds.  \nIn this paper I argue that Hacking is wrong. I claim that he has failed to show that human \nkinds cannot be natural kinds. The feedback that Hacking claims makes human kinds so very \ndifferent from natural kinds is supposed to operate at two levels, a cultural level and a conceptual \nlevel.  I will examine each type of feedback in turn, and show that in so far as feedback occurs it is \ncompatible with human kinds being natural kinds. Before going on to outline and assess Hacking\u2019s \narguments, however, it will be helpful to first get clearer about the nature of natural kinds. \n  \n1. Natural Kinds \nPage 2 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\n  \nHacking claims that human kinds cannot be natural kinds, but what exactly are natural kinds? \nUnfortunately, a straightforward answer cannot be given here. There are multiple accounts of natural \nkinds, and all are controversial. Essentialists claim that all members of a natural kind share some \nessential property (see for example, Wilkerson [1995]). These essential properties fulfil two roles. \nFirst, the class of entities possessing the essential property delineates the membership of the kind\u2013to \nbelong to the natural kind \u2018gold\u2019 it is necessary and sufficient to have an atomic number of 79. \nSecond, the essential property largely determines the other properties possessed by members of the \nkind\u2013it is a lawful consequence of having an atomic number of 79 that a piece of material will be \nmetal, will conduct electricity, will be solid at 20\u00b0C, will be largely inert, and so on. \nA major difficulty for an essentialist account of natural kinds is that for biological species, \nwhich are traditionally considered amongst the best examples of natural kinds, no plausible \ncandidates for the essences can be found. As John Dupr\u00e9 ([1981], pp.84-5) has pointed out there are \nreasons for thinking that often there will be no one genetic property or set of properties shared by all \nmembers of a species. Most importantly, evolutionary theory suggests that it will be beneficial for \nthere to be variation in the genes possessed by members of a species as this will enable the species to \nadapt quickly when the environment changes. The existence of genetic diseases gives another reason \nfor thinking that the genetic properties of members of a kind will vary. \nThere are two possible ways of responding to such concerns. Terence Wilkerson ([1995]) \nchooses to stick with essentialism. He argues that if biological species lack essential properties then \nthis only goes to show that they are not natural kinds. If such an option is taken then it becomes hard \nto see the motivation behind Hacking\u2019s argument. Someone who thinks that biological species are \nnot natural kinds will almost certainly already think that human kinds cannot be natural kinds either. \nTo such people Hacking will seem to be arguing for the obvious.  \nAlternatively, one may claim that biological species are paradigmatic examples of natural \nkinds, and that if essentialist accounts of natural kinds cannot accommodate them, essentialism must \nbe rejected. This is the route taken by Dupr\u00e9 himself ([1981], [1993]), and by Richard Boyd \n([1991]), amongst others. A variety of non-essentialist accounts of natural kinds, designed to deal \nwith biological species, have now been proposed. I will outline three of these non-essentialist \naccounts of natural kinds below, in order to give the reader some flavour of current debates. If a non-\nPage 3 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\nessentialist account of natural kinds is adopted then it is a serious possibility that human \nkinds might be natural kinds, and Hacking\u2019s argument will be of interest. \nJohn Dupr\u00e9 ([1981], [1993]) argues for an account he calls \u2018promiscuous realism\u2019. He asks us \nto imagine the individual entities of some domain (he considers biological organisms but his ideas \ncan be generalised) mapped out on a multidimensional quality space. Dupr\u00e9 claims that in such a \nmap we would find numerous clusters corresponding to groups of similar entities. In many cases the \nclusters will not be discrete, but will be messy and hard to make out. Some clusters will correspond \nto traditional natural kinds. At different levels of resolution other clusters might be discerned\u2013as well \nas a cluster that corresponds to dogs, there will be finer clusters corresponding to dog-breeds, and, at \na finer level still, to particular strains of pedigree dogs. Different clusters can also be generated by \nrestricting our attention to particular dimensions of the map. If we restrict our attention to the \ndimensions that code for nutritional value, for example, we will find a cluster of things that are \npoisonous to humans. Dupr\u00e9\u2019s account is realist because the clusters in quality space reflect the real \nstructure of nature. It is promiscuous because there will be many different clusters on which we \ncould choose to focus. \nOther non-essentialist accounts have been proposed by Richard Boyd and by Ruth Millikan. \nLike Dupr\u00e9, Boyd ([1991])  argues that members of a kind possess a cluster of regularly co-\noccurring properties. Unlike Dupr\u00e9, he stresses that this is for a reason, there is some \u2018homeostatic\u2019 \nmechanism that makes it the case that these properties re-occur. Boyd\u2019s account works well for \nbiological species. Members of a species possess clusters of co-occurring properties and this is as a \nresult of homeostatic mechanisms, such as gene flow between the organisms and pressures that arise \nfrom the fact that all members of the species must survive in similar environments. Although he \ndoesn\u2019t go into details, Boyd suggests that his account can also accommodate human kinds (although \nhe calls these \u2018social kinds\u2019).  \nCentral to Millikan\u2019s ([1997]) account is the idea that species can be considered to be \nindividuals, a thesis originally proposed by M. Ghiselin ([1974]) and D. Hull ([1976]). Like other \nindividuals, species have histories; they develop and eventually die. Unlike normal individuals, \nspecies can also be considered as classes of individuals and can be spatially dispersed. Millikan uses \nthe idea that species are individuals to explain how it is possible to run inductive inference over the \nmembers of a species. She argues that we can make inductive inferences over the members of a \nPage 4 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\nspecies in much the same way that we can make inductive inferences over the temporal parts \nof an ordinary individual. If someone could speak Turkish yesterday it is a good bet that he can \nspeak it today, and it will be causally because he could speak it yesterday that he can speak it today. \nSimilarly the reasons why one can run inductions over the members of a species are causal, historical \nreasons. It is because members of a species share common ancestors and live in the same niche that \nthey are similar.   \nHere I will not attempt to determine which, if any, of the above accounts is correct. As the \ndebates over natural kinds have been intense and ongoing, it is unlikely that any particular account of \nnatural kinds will become generally accepted in the near future. Given this uncertainty concerning \nthe nature of natural kinds, is there any way of determining whether human kinds are natural kinds? \nDon\u2019t we need to get straight about natural kinds before we can decide whether human kinds are \ndistinct? Fortunately for this paper I think that there is a means by which we can sensibly ask \nwhether human kinds are natural kinds in the absence of an agreed account of natural kinds. So long \nas we reject Wilkerson\u2019s view (and, as mentioned earlier, unless we do this Hacking\u2019s argument is of \nlittle interest) we can point to some paradigmatic examples of natural kinds\u2013chemical elements, \nfundamental particles, and biological species. As such we can ask whether human kinds are distinct \nfrom natural kinds via considering whether human kinds are fundamentally like or unlike kinds such \nas chemical elements, fundamental particles and biological species.  \nThis approach ties in with what Hacking himself has to say about natural kinds. Hacking \nholds that nature has kinds, but tends to avoid being drawn into metaphysical disputes about their \ncharacter.\n[2]\n He sees himself as part of a tradition of moderate believers in kinds that includes Mill, \nVenn, Russell, Price and Quine (Hacking [1992], p.185), but says little more than this. Thinkers in \nthis tradition hold that members of a kind are similar to each other, although they disagree on the \nextent to which entities have to be similar to count as being members of a kind. Quine ([1969], \np.234), for example, speaks of entities being of a kind if they share even one property. At the other \nextreme, Mill ([1973], p.123) holds that members of a natural kind have \u2018unknown multitudes of \nproperties in common\u2019.  \nRather than providing a detailed account of natural kinds, Hacking tends to illustrate what he \ntalking about by pointing at examples. He lists quarks, cystic fibrosis, mud, the common cold, and \nsunsets (Hacking [1995b], p.352). This list indicates that Hacking\u2019s understanding of \u2018natural kind\u2019 \nPage 5 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\nis more liberal than that of many theorists. He seems happy to apply the term \u2018natural kind\u2019 to \nany kinds that we can distinguish in nature. In keeping with tradition, however, Hacking thinks that \nthere will be laws that govern the behaviour of natural kinds. Laws ensure that quarks will behave in \nquarky ways; Hacking thinks there are also laws that ensure that mud will behave in mud-like ways. \nWhether Hacking would be better off restricting his use of the term \u2018natural kind\u2019 to \ntraditional examples (lions and quarks, but not sunsets) is a point that will not be discussed here. \nHowever this point should be decided, Hacking accepts that biological species and chemical \nelements count as natural kinds. In assessing his claim that human kinds cannot be natural kinds, I \nwill consider biological species and chemical elements to be paradigmatic examples of natural kinds. \nHacking will be happy with these choices, and they have the advantage of also being acceptable to \nmost theorists writing on natural kinds. \nHacking argues that our classificatory practices can affect human kinds in ways that they \ncannot affect natural kinds. As a consequence he claims that human kinds cannot be natural kinds. I \nwill assess this claim in the absence of an agreed account of natural kinds via considering whether it \nis true that the feedback mechanisms Hacking discusses affect human kinds but not kinds of \nchemical element and biological species. This approach should be acceptable to all but Wilkerson-\nstyle essentialists. Wilkerson-style essentialists will think it obvious that human kinds cannot be \nnatural kinds, and so will not be interested in the debate here in any case. \n  \n  \n2. Hacking\u2019s Feedback Mechanisms \n  \n2.1. Cultural Feedback \n  \nFeedback at the cultural level is dependent on the description of a kind of person entering popular \nculture. Often human kind terms carry heavy moral overtones; consider for example, \u2018sexual \npervert\u2019, \u2018alcoholic\u2019, and \u2018normal\u2019. Being classified in a certain way may also carry institutionalised \nbenefits or costs. Thus people are motivated to attempt to alter the ways in which they are classified \nand, as their behaviour changes, so do the kinds under study. Consider, for example, the kind \u2018obese \nperson\u2019. Attitudes towards obesity result in new human kinds, such as \u2018people with stapled \nPage 6 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\nstomachs\u2019, coming into existence. The characteristics of both obese and non-obese people are also \naffected by attitudes towards obesity. When obesity becomes stigmatised obese people will tend to \nbecome socially isolated and unhappy, while non-obese people will start making jokes about obesity \nand worry about becoming obese themselves. Hacking claims that the existence of such feedback \nshows that human kinds cannot be natural kinds. \nJ. Bogen ([1988]) has interpreted Hacking as claiming that human kinds are not natural kinds \nbecause the classification of human kinds results in feedback. Hacking rejects such an interpretation. \nIn any case, as Bogen points out, such an argument would fail because our classificatory practices \nalso result in feedback that alters some natural kinds. For example, because marijuana is classified as \nillegal the plants are grown in attics and wardrobes altering their physical appearance. As another \nexample, the characteristics of domestic livestock change over time because particular animals are \nclassified as being the \u2018Best in Show\u2019 and are used in selective breeding\u2013sheep and pigs would now \nlook very different if it weren\u2019t for our classificatory practices. \nHacking\u2019s argument that human kinds are not natural kinds must rest, not merely on the fact \nthat feedback occurs, but rather on the fact that it occurs in a particular way. The difference, Hacking \nclaims ([1997], p.15), is that feedback in human kinds occurs because subjects become aware of the \nways in which they are being described and judged.  \nThis idea needs working on before it can become an argument that human kinds cannot be \nnatural kinds. As it stands Hacking has merely claimed that human kinds can be affected by a \nmechanism to which other kinds of entity are immune. Although this shows that there is some \ndifference between human kinds and other kinds, it is not sufficient to show that this difference is of \nany fundamental significance. After all many other types of entity can be affected by mechanisms to \nwhich only entities of that type are vulnerable. While it is true that only human kinds are affected by \nthe subjects\u2019 ideas, it is also true that only bacteria are affected by antibiotics, and that only domestic \nanimals can be selectively bred. But no one would cite this as evidence that \u2018bacterial kinds\u2019 or \n\u2018domestic animal kinds\u2019 are not natural kinds. \nThe fact that only human kinds are affected by the subject\u2019s ideas will only be a reason for \nthinking that human kinds are distinct from natural kinds if an extra premise is added to the effect \nthat being affected by ideas is of greater metaphysical significance than being affected by, say, \nantibiotics. In places Hacking suggests that feedback caused by the subject\u2019s awareness of being \nPage 7 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\nclassified is important because it results in feedback occurring at a faster rate than that which \naffects natural kinds (see, for example, Hacking [1992], p.190). The thought seems to be that the \nspeed with which change occurs confounds our attempts to use human kinds in inductive inferences. \nSuch a claim is questionable. Do human kinds really change more quickly than bacteria and viruses \nmutate? In any case, a difference in the rate of feedback is inadequate to mark a fundamental \nmetaphysical distinction between human kinds and natural kinds. If it were true that the \ncharacteristics of human kinds shifted more rapidly this would be reason, not for claiming that \nhuman kinds cannot be natural kinds, but rather for claiming that human kinds are not particularly \nuseful natural kinds. \nAlternatively, idea-dependence might be thought to matter because it betrays the subjective \nnature of a kind. The argument then would be that while natural kinds are objective, human kinds are \naffected by ideas and so subjective, and that thus human kinds cannot be natural kinds. Hacking \ngives no indication that this is a route he would wish to go down; however it is the most obvious \noption for someone who wishes to claim that idea-dependence is metaphysically significant and so \nworth pursuing here. \nHowever, entities can be idea-dependent in two fundamentally different senses. And, as I will \nargue, idea-dependence in only one of these senses is indicative of subjectivity. Compare two senses \nin which ideas of female beauty \u2018affect\u2019 entities: In one case a woman, influenced by images of the \n\u2018ideal female form\u2019, decides she is too fat and so slims. Her altered shape is idea-dependent in the \nsense that her ideas concerning her weight caused her to slim. The development of Concord was \ndependent on the ideas of its developers in much the same kind of way; the developers had ideas \nabout aeroplane designs, and these ideas feature in the causal history that culminated in the building \nof Concorde. Nevertheless, despite being in a sense \u2018idea-dependent\u2019 the reduction in the woman\u2019s \nweight, and the building of Concorde, are both perfectly objective. Idea dependence of this type \nresults in objective changes in entities and is perfectly compatible with a kind being objective. \nOn the other hand consider the case where we look at old photos of the first Miss World. \nMiss World looks rather plump and short by today\u2019s standards, nevertheless presumably at the time \nshe looked fine. Miss World\u2019s looks are also idea-dependent, but this time nothing about the photo of \nMiss World has actually changed. Rather the ideas prevalent in popular culture have made the \nproperties of the photo appear different solely by acting on the viewers. The change is a relational \nPage 8 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\nchange only. Such relational changes indicate that a kind, such as \u2018attractive women\u2019 is \nmerely a subjective kind and so not a natural kind. \nHacking has shown that human kinds are idea-dependent. In order to show that this means \nthat human kinds are subjective and thus cannot be natural kinds, it would need to be shown that \nhuman kinds are idea-dependent in the way that produces relational as opposed to genuine changes. \nAll Hacking\u2019s examples, however, seem to be of cases where ideas produce genuine changes in \npeoples\u2019 behaviour. Take, for example, the case of Multiple Personality Disorder (Hacking, \n[1995a]). When patients with personalities of the opposite sex and animal personalities started to \nappear on American chat shows and be written about in magazines more and more patients started \npresenting with similar symptoms. The ideas prevalent in popular culture affected the symptoms \ntypical of Multiple Personality Disorder. Still, here it seems that the ideas about Multiple Personality \nDisorder caused a genuine change in patients\u2019 symptoms. Patients really did start barking as a result \nof ideas. Such a claim need no more incriminate the kind \u2018Multiple Personality Disorder\u2019 than the \nclaim that changing views on animal welfare have resulted in fewer dogs having their tails docked \nincriminates the kind \u2018dog\u2019. In order to show that the changes in the symptoms of Multiple \nPersonality Disorder indicate that it is not a natural kind, Hacking would need to show that barking, \nlike beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, and he makes no suggestion that this is the case. \n  \n2.2 Conceptual Feedback \n  \nHacking\u2019s argument for feedback at a conceptual level is dependent on Elizabeth Anscombe\u2019s \naccount of intentional action. In her 1957 monograph, Intention, Anscombe considers the \ncircumstances under which an action can be said to be intentional. Her solution is that an action X \ncan be said to be intentional when the actor could respond to the question \u2018Why are you doing X?\u2019 \nby giving a reason for acting. If the actor cannot answer the \u2018Why?\u2019 question because he is not aware \nthat he is doing X, or if he knows he is X-ing but only because he has observed it, e.g. blushing, or if \nthe actor knows he is X-ing but the cause is presumed to be purely non-mental, e.g. a muscle spasm, \nthen the behaviour is not an intentional action.  \nOn such an account an action is only intentional under a description because occasionally \nwhen we ask an agent \u2018Why are you X-ing?\u2019 he may fail to recognise his action under certain \nPage 9 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\ndescriptions. For example, I am in the kitchen X-ing, where X may be either \u2018cooking\u2019 or \n\u2018getting in the way of my flat-mates\u2019. I recognise my action only under the description of \u2018cooking\u2019, \nas I have not noticed that I am getting in the way. The action passes The Why Test, and thus is an \nintentional action, only under the description of \u2018cooking\u2019. \nFollowing Anscombe, Hacking uses the slogan \u2018intentional actions are actions under a \ndescription\u2019 in his argument that feedback occurs in human kinds: \n1. Intentional actions are actions under a description. \n2. Intentional actions make us the kind of person we are. \n________________________________________________________ \nNew descriptions allow new intentional actions, which allow new kinds of person. \n  \nIf Hacking is correct then the creation of new descriptions makes logically possible the \ncreation of new kinds of person.\n[3]\n In creating new terminology the human sciences would make it \npossible for people to act in new ways. Here, however, I shall argue that Hacking\u2019s argument fails \nbecause he has misinterpreted Anscombe\u2019s phrase \u2018under a description\u2019. \nThe phrase \u2018under a description\u2019 occurs throughout Anscombe\u2019s monograph. However its use \nis idiosyncratic and in \u2018Under a Description\u2019 Anscombe explains how she intended the phrase. She \nwrites, \u2018under a description is \u201cqua\u201d...in modern dress\u2019. Anscombe gives an example indicating that \nshe uses \u2018qua\u2019 in the usual manner, she writes \u2018A may, qua B, receive such-and-such a salary and, \nqua C, such-and-such a salary.\u2019 ([1971], p.208). \nIf Anscombe in fact meant \u2018Intentional action is only intentional qua some aspect\u2019 why did \nshe use the misleading phrase \u2018under a description\u2019? Anscombe worked in the ordinary language \ntradition. Her monograph aims to give an account of what we say about commonplace actions. \nWithin Anscombe\u2019s domain of the everyday the possibility of something being intended qua X, \nwhere there is no description that refers to X does not have to be considered, as it is fair to assume \nthat all commonplace intentions have already been described. Thus Anscombe can treat \u2018under a \ndescription\u2019 and \u2018qua\u2019 as equivalent. \nHacking, however, is interested precisely in the situations that Anscombe can ignore. \nHacking wants to consider the new possibilities for action created by a new description; he needs to \ncontrast what was possible before the description was invented with what is possible after. In such \nPage 10 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\ncases the interpretation of \u2018under a description\u2019 becomes key. Consider Ug the caveman, \nsitting in his cave at the dawn of time before language developed. According to Hacking, Ug cannot \nintentionally light a fire, go outside, or hum himself a tune\u2013as there are no descriptions, Ug must \nwait for them to develop before he can intentionally do anything. \nIf, on the other hand, we take \u2018under a description\u2019 to merely mean \u2018qua\u2019, Ug is free to intentionally \nact in many ways. Ug can intend his banging flints qua a way to make a fire, rather than qua a way to \nmake a noise. Although we cannot use The Why Test to find out what Ug intends to do, there are \nother ways in which we can decide what it is that he intends. We can consider Ug\u2019s probable \nmotives: if it is cold he would have reason to make a fire, if other people are banging drums he \nprobably wants to make a noise. We can watch Ug\u2019s response when we intervene in his action\u2013if he \nintends to light a fire bringing in wood will tend to make him smile, if he\u2019s starting a music session \nsinging would probably be more welcome. \nSuch an approach fits in well with Anscombe\u2019s discussion of the intentional actions of non-\nverbal agents. In \u2018Under a Description\u2019 she discusses a bird who lands on a twig that happens to be \nboth covered in bird lime and near some seeds. The bird, she says, lands on the twig with the \nintention of reaching a seed but not with the intention of landing in the bird lime. We infer the bird\u2019s \nintention by attributing intentions that are appropriate for the bird given its perceptual apparatus, its \nintelligence, and typical bird behaviour. We think that birds can identify seeds, that they get hungry, \nand that typically birds try to get seeds, and so we attribute the intention of getting the seed to the \nbird. \nThe problem of deciding how an action is intended arises because one bodily behaviour can \nhelp fulfil several different possible goals. Thus we cannot decide what someone intends merely by \nlooking at their movements. Hacking presumes that the conditions under which an intentional action \ncan be performed are identical to the conditions under which an observer can infer the actor\u2019s \nintentions. He sets about asking when intentional actions are possible via asking how an observer can \ndetermine what it is that an agent intends, and assumes that if one cannot tell what an agent intends \nthat no intentional action is possible. This is only permissible if some verificationist principle is \nadopted. Even if such a principle is considered acceptable, however, if \u2018under a description\u2019 is \ninterpreted as \u2018qua\u2019 there is no reason to think that intentional actions are logically dependent on the \nexistence of descriptions. Asking an actor to explain his actions is one way, but not the only way, to \nPage 11 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\ndiscover what an agent intended. Using the method of asking the actor requires descriptions, \nbut as there are other means of inferring an actor\u2019s intentions which do not depend on descriptions, it \ncannot be concluded that descriptions are essential for intentional actions. Ug can intend to make a \nfire, and the bird can intend to land on the twig, without any descriptions being required. In such \ncases Hacking is simply wrong to claim that descriptions are required for intentional action. \nOf course not all actions are so contingently linked to language. Consider the act of marrying \nsomeone, or the act of promising.\n[4]\n In order to marry a man one actually has to say, \u2018I hereby take \nthis man to be my lawfully wedded husband\u2019. Similarly, someone can only promise to do something \nif they say, \u2018I promise to do X\u2019. Without the descriptions relating to marriage and promising, there \ncan be no such actions. I suggest, however, that such actions form an unusual class. Such actions are \npeculiar in that they are defined in pseudo-legal ways, and the law, of course, unlike everyday \nthinking, dislikes ambiguity.  It is extremely important to people that they have a way of being sure \nwhether or not they are married, and of being sure when they have been promised something. That \nthese actions are defined as being tied to the utterance of descriptions acts to reduce possible sources \nof doubt as to whether an intentional action has occurred or not. That one actually has to say \nparticular sentences in order to get married makes it extremely unlikely that one could find oneself \nconsidered married by accident. In contrast, in everyday life we are able, and forced, to tolerate \nuncertainty, and accept conventions whereby we can say that this or that person intended to do X or \nY even though there is a chance that we are wrong. In short while there is  a class of pseudo-legal \nactions that are logically tied to their descriptions, such actions are only a sub-set of all actions. I can \naccept that the logical link between such actions and descriptions means that kinds such as \n\u2018promisee\u2019 and \u2018husband\u2019 will not form natural kinds, but still argue that no such logical link \nbetween actions and descriptions affects kinds such as \u2018autistic person\u2019, \u2018obese person\u2019 and \n\u2018homosexual\u2019.  \nI accept, in addition, that there might be contingent links between descriptions and the ability \nto perform certain types of intentional actions. Some actions might be too complicated to perform \nwithout the aid of a description, for example, cooking certain complicated dishes might require a \nrecipe describing what is to be done at each stage. It might also be true that actors only act in certain \nways because certain descriptions exist in a culture, for example, it might be true that the existence \nof a tradition of limerick writing in a sense makes it possible for us to intend to write a limerick, as \nPage 12 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\nwithout the tradition no individual would ever think of doing such a strange thing. In such \ncases, however, our ability to perform certain intentional actions is only contingently dependent on \nthe existence of certain descriptions. The descriptions in the culture may cause us to act in certain \nways, but they are not needed for it to be logically possible for us to act in certain ways. Hacking\u2019s \nconceptual feedback has collapsed back into his cultural feedback and, as I have already argued, the \nexistence of such feedback does not show that human kinds are not natural kinds. I conclude that \nHacking\u2019s argument fails and he has not shown that human kinds are not natural kinds. \nCritics may protest that even if I am right this is not important. Fair enough, they may say, \nHacking was mistaken in claiming to have shown that human kinds cannot be natural kinds. Still, his \nimportant claims, which have to do with feedback and interaction, remain. Through his case studies \nconcerning Multiple Personality Disorder, child abuse, and autism, Hacking has shown us that kinds \nof people emerge along with our categorisations of them. People are affected by categories, and \ncategories by people, and the important thing Hacking has done is to draw our attention to this. The \narguments that human kinds are not natural kinds, they may suggest, are not really that important to \nthis project.  \nI am happy to accept that many useful things can be learned from Hacking\u2019s case studies \neven if my argument in this paper is correct. This paper is not intended to be a generalised exercise \nin Hacking-bashing, and I am happy for Hacking to be right about a great many things. My sole \nclaim in this paper is that Hacking has failed to show that human kinds are not natural kinds. Still, I \nhold that this claim is important. In the literature on natural kinds, natural kinds are often thought to \nappear in natural laws, to function in explanations, and to support inductive inferences. As such, \nwhether human kinds are distinct from natural kinds matters. If human kinds are natural kinds then \nthis suggests that accounts of laws, explanations, and the basis of sound inductive inferences, \ndeveloped for the natural sciences, can be carried across in to the human sciences. If human kinds \nare not natural kinds, then this will be a reason for thinking that distinct accounts will be required. \nOf course, even if I am right and Hacking\u2019s argument fails, there may be other arguments not \nconsidered here that do succeed in showing that human kinds are not natural kinds. This paper is not \nintended to settle once and for all the question of whether human kinds are natural kinds, it merely \nseeks to show that one influential argument against this claim fails. \n  \nPage 13 of 17Arguments Against Mental Diseases Being Natural Kinds\n08\/01\/2008http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/261\/1\/MS961k.htm\n  \nAcknowledgements  \n  \nI would like to thank John Forrester, Ian Hacking, Martin Kusch, Peter Lipton, and Tony Marcel for \ncomments on drafts of this paper.
