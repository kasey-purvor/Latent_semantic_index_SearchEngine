Indeed, the Fourth \nAssessment Report of the Intergovern- mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \nanticipates rapid changes in climate even if the greenhouse-  gas emissions are \nreduced quickly,1 and recent findings suggest that these projections are \nunderestimated.2 The impacts of climate change will be severe, particularly for the \nmost vulnerable developing countries that have the least capacity to cope. As a \nresult, the need to support adaptation in developing countries is growing in \nurgency. \nAdaptation describes adjustments in natural or human systems in response to the \nimpacts of climate change.3 Until recently, adaptation was a controversial topic in \nclimate change policy debates, with many arguing that too much atten- tion to \nadaptation\u2014considered locally focused, inexpensive, and beneficial only in the \nshort term\u2014could detract from more expensive mitigation efforts for the global \ngood. In his 1992 book, Earth in the Balance, Al Gore wrote, \u201cBelieving that we \ncan adapt to just abut anything is ultimately a kind of laziness, an arrogant faith in \nour ability to react in time.\u201d4 \nHowever, the tide is turning. Given slow progress on mitigation coupled with \nevidence of greater and more rapid impacts of climate change than those \npreviously expected by the IPCC, adapta- tion is firmly on the international policy \nagenda as a crucial supplement to mitiga- tion. Signaling this change, Gore stated \nin a recent interview with the Economist, \u201cI used to think adaptation subtracted \nfrom our efforts on prevention. But I\u2019ve changed my mind. . . . Poor countries are \nvulnerable and need our help.\u201d5 \nOne growing proposal for an approach to adaptation is community-based \nadaptation. Community-based adaptation operates at the local level in \ncommunities that are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It identifies, \nassists, and implements community-based development activities that strengthen \nthe capacity of local people to adapt to living in a riskier and less predictable \nclimate. Moreover, community-based adaptation generates adaptation strategies \nthrough participatory processes, involving local stakeholders and development and \ndisaster risk\u2013reduction practitioners. It builds on existing cultural norms and \naddresses local development concerns that make people vulnerable to the impacts \nof climate change in the first place. Three international conferences on \ncommunity-based adaptation have been organized by international organizations \nand think tanks6 since 2005, with policymakers, researchers, and development \norganizations among the attendees. Com- munity-based adaptation projects are \nnow in operation in vulnerable communities in developing and some developed \ncountries. \nYet fundamental challenges and uncertainties remain about the interpretation of \nadaptation policy, which in turn affects the implementation of community-based \nadaptation. What is adaptation to climate change (versus more general climatic \nvariability)? Who or what adapts\u2014and how? How does community-based \nadaptation fit with larger-scale adaptation policies and programs? Early debates \nabout community-based adaptation, and adaptation in general, are grappling with \nthese questions. In addition, examples of community-based adaptation in \nvulnerable communities in Bangladesh help illuminate the role and value of \ncommunity-based adaptation, its limitations, and its potential to help integrate \nconcerns about vulnerability and development into wider climate change policy. \nApproaches to Adaptation \nAdaptation was not a major part of the debate when climate change came onto the \ninternational policy agenda at the UN General Assembly in 1988. Initial \napproaches generally focused on mitigation through reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions at source or increasing the sequestration of carbon through managing \nreforestation and land use.7 The United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 mentioned adaptation only five times, never \ndefining it. \nSince then, adaptation has gained stand- ing within the international climate \nchange arena. The Third Assessment Report of the IPCC in 2001 defined \nadaptation as \u201cadjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or \nexpected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits \nbeneficial opportunities.\u201d8 Six years later, at the 13th Conference of the Parties of \nthe UNFCCC, adaptation formed one of four steps of the so-called Bali Roadmap, \nwhich paves the way for a post-Kyoto policy framework to include adaptation \nalongside mitigation, technology cooperation, and finance.9 \nEmerging from this climate change pol- icy context, the most common approach \nto adaptation considers how far processes of adaptation can reduce dangerous \nimpacts of climate change and therefore defines the highest acceptable thresholds \nof green- house gas concentrations. This approach also supports adaptation \npractices that aim to lessen the impacts of increased atmospheric greenhouse gas \nconcentrations, for example, through engineering and technological measures \nincluding new seed varieties, water management, and early warning systems based \non projections of future climate conditions and an expected severity in events such \nas storms, droughts, or tidal surges.10 \nAcademic observers have described this approach as the \u201cpollutionist\u201d view11 \nbecause it focuses on informing climate change policies that are driven by control- \nling overall levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, but a \nnumber of critics have questioned whether this approach is always appropriate.12 \nFirst, some observers have pointed out that focusing on uncertain climate impacts \nhas slowed down adaptation practices because potential victims of climate change \nand aid donors are often reluctant to commit to adaptation if they do not yet know \nexactly what they are adapting to. \nSecond, large-scale engineering or technological investments may not be the most \ncost-effective way to reduce vulnerability to climate change.13 A longstanding lit- \nerature within development studies14 has argued that risks posed by disasters and \nnatural hazards are often linked more to social, economic, and even political \nfactors in different contexts rather than simply the size of physical events such as \nstorms and floods. In this sense, social vulnerability to climate change is \ninseparable from the development context.15 Accordingly, technology-based \nmeasures can only be partially effective if they do not also address nonclimatic \nfactors that are the underlying drivers of vulnerability, which may vary between \nlocal conditions. For example, the implementation and effectiveness of new \ndrought-resistant crop varieties is limited by their acceptance in a community, \nwhich in turn depends on costs and availability of the seeds, access to fertilizer \nand other inputs, storage constraints, ease of preparation, and even cultural \npreferences for flavor.16 \nAs a result of these concerns, a newly forming, more development-oriented \nperspective to adaptation considers development and adaptation risks as strongly \ncomplementary. Under this approach, adaptation is not only focused on \nanticipating enhanced physical risks associated with increased greenhouse gas \nconcentrations. Rather, it also addresses developmental needs such as improving \naccess to livelihoods and productive assets to increase the adaptive capacity of \npoorer, more vulnerable people. Some observers have said any adaptation \nintervention can- not stand alone but must go hand-in-hand with development, \neither through main- streaming adaptation into development (adaptation plus \ndevelopment), or even by being synonymous with development (adaptation as \ndevelopment).17 Adaptation as development in effect implies seeing overall \ndevelopment as an effective contribution to withstanding future cli- mate change. \nThis form of development would include acts such as achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals of reducing poverty, enhancing education and health, \nimproving living conditions, and providing access to financial markets and \ntechnologies for poorer countries, communities within countries, and even \nindividuals.18 \nCommunity-based adaptation takes the approach of adaptation as development. \nResponding to the concept that adaptation is local and place-based, it addresses the \nlocally and contextually specified nature of climate change vulnerability because it \ntakes place at local levels where people encounter impacts, build adaptive \ncapacity, and respond. A community-based approach considers that adaptation \nstrategies must be generated through participatory processes, involving local \nstake- holders and development and disaster risk\u2013reduction practitioners, rather \nthan being restricted to impacts-based scientific inputs alone. As such, expertise in \nvulnerability reduction must come from local community-based case studies and \nindigenous knowledge of locally appropriate solutions to climatic variability and \nextremes. \nCommunity-Based Adaptation in Bangladesh \nBangladesh is frequently cited as one of the most vulnerable countries to cli- mate \nchange19 because of its flat and low-lying topography and location on the coast at \nthe top of the Bay of Bengal, which make it vulnerable to cyclones and tidal \nsurges. Moreover, Bangladesh also suffers from a history of impoverishment, high \npopulation density, weak political governance, and a reliance of many livelihoods \non climate-sensitive sectors, particularly agriculture and fisheries.20 Many of the \nanticipated adverse effects of climate change, such as sea-level rise, higher \ntemperatures, enhanced monsoon precipitation, and increased cyclone intensity, \nwill aggravate the existing stresses that already impede development in \nBangladesh.21 \nThe international community has recognized Bangladesh as a particularly \nvulnerable country for some time, and the country has received disaster \nmanagement and adaptation support in several sectors. Bangladesh has developed \nsome capacity for dealing with the impacts of climate change at the national level \nand \nhas mobilized policy response options that deal with vulnerability reduction to \nenvironmental variability in general and, more recently, to climate change in \nparticular. For example, Bangladesh was one of the first countries to submit its \nNational Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) to the UNFCCC and more \nrecently has developed a national climate change strategy to deal with mitigation \nand adaptation. At the same time, community-based adaptation responses are \nemerging both autonomously and supported by NGOs and local partners. \nOne example can be drawn from the Gaibandha district in northern Bangladesh, \nwhich is covered by water during the monsoon season, making it impossible to \ngrow crops using traditional methods. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report notes \nthat climate change will bring greater precipitation extremes, including more \nintense monsoonal rainfall, which will exacerbate flooding in Gaibandha.22 The \ninternational NGO Practical Action is working with local communities in this \ndistrict to develop ways of allowing farmers to grow food on flooded land, using a \nprocess of community-led identification and prioritization of natural resource \nmanagement options and technologies. Detailed consultation meetings, in addition \nto assessments of the needs, skills, assets, and capacities of the community \nthrough household surveys led to the development of participatory action plans of \ndevelopment, which identified a number of options for tailoring existing and new \ntechnologies to meet the needs of the community.23 \nFor example, the innovative technology of floating gardens, or hydroponics, that \nvillagers have taken up in many other waterlogged and flooded areas of Bangla- \ndesh24 has been introduced to Gaibandha. A floating garden is built from a raft of \nwater hyacinth typically about 8 meters long and 1 meter wide. The raft is covered \nwith soil, compost, and manure, in which vegetable seeds are planted. The raft will \nlast just one year but can be used as fertilizer during the dry season. To ensure \nsustainability of the program, training and input support was tailored to the \nparticular profile of household members, and technologies were accompanied by a \nwidespread climate change aware- ness program.25 The work in Gaibandha was \npartly inspired by bad flooding in 2007, which prompted organizations such as \nPractical Action to look into long- term methods of reducing vulnerability to \ninundation, as well short-term disaster relief. \nVillagers in Gaibandha use floating gardens to grow vegetables such as bitter \ngourds, green okra, and leafy greens, which provide subsistence for people even \nduring the annual monga (period of food shortage). Indeed, in some cases, these \nvegetables also provide an alternative source of income when surplus is sold in the \nmarket. Because the rafts can be moved from place to place, they are also suitable \nfor those who have temporarily or permanently lost their homes and land during \nincreasingly severe flooding conditions. \nMeasuring the success of any community-based adaptation project is inherently \nproblematic, mainly because the impacts are in the form of outcomes that have not \nhappened\u2014in this case, the crops not lost due to inundation and the economic \nimpacts that did not result.26 It is too early to tell whether the project has resulted \nin long-term resilience building, given that the project is only four years old, and \nthe project implementers suggest that the real test for the project will depend on \nwhether it can be scaled up.27 \nIn the coastal areas of southern Bangladesh, one further threat of climate change is \nincreasing salinity\u2014the encroachment of saltwater onto and beneath agricultural \nland. Saltwater makes it difficult to grow crops historically irrigated by freshwater, \nand it can accelerate the deterioration of buildings. In Mongla district, near the \nmangrove forests of the Sunderbans, villagers are responding to the threats of \nsalinity by building houses on raised platforms and installing sealed containers of \nfreshwater. Small containers\u2014called mokti\u2014are often made of pottery and partly \nburied into the clay soil surrounding houses to provide reservoirs of freshwater for \nevery house. Larger water tanks of plastic or even concrete are also installed near \nschools or in villager centers to provide a more communal and robust reservoir. \nThe freshwater usually comes from rain that is channeled off roofs into containers. \nSome wealthier farmers are also converting old rice fields to fishponds and using \nthese to fatten crabs for local restaurants or for consumption in Dhaka, \nBangladesh\u2019s capital city. \nIn the coastal district of Noakhali, South Bangladesh, the International Union for \nConservation of Nature (IUCN) has been implementing the Promotion of \nAdaptation to Climate Change and Climate Variability Project, which aims in part \nto increase adaptive capacity at the community level. One community-based \nadaptation project under this program involves raising and reinforcing homesteads \nto make them more resilient against flooding and cyclonic activity, reducing the \nneed for people to flee their homes during extreme weather events and reducing \nlosses. The project brings together a design team of local individuals engaged as \nvillage-level house-building specialists, architects, planners, an engineer, a \ngeographer, architecture students from local universities, user groups, and local \nbuilders and carpenters to develop preliminary design options. The team selects \none family in the community for whom to build the first demonstration house. \nOnce built, a new local design and construction team is formed from the now-\nexperienced local members of the first team, who move the project forward in \ntheir community, building other houses in the locality along with the house \nowners. \nHouse design is based on traditional cultural preferences but incorporate modest \ntechnological innovations that help strengthen or otherwise improve parts of the \nhouse that are particularly weak and vulnerable in the local climate. These include \nraising foundations, reinforcing house structures, and creating raised plat- forms \nwithin homes where people can take shelter during floods. Planting extensively \nalong edges of homesteads is a local way of reducing wind impacts. \nCommunity-based adaptation is not restricted to developing countries such as \nBangladesh but can also be used among vulnerable communities in more \ndeveloped regions (see the box on page TK). \nChallenges to Community- Based Adaptation \nThe approaches described above indicate how adaptation to climate change can be \nintegrated with local development needs and economic trends rather than simply \nbeing used to slow down physical changes such as rising sea levels or increasing \nsalinity. Proponents of com- munity-based adaptation say it has made excellent \nprogress in achieving place- based resilience building and addressing local social \nvulnerability rather than assessing climate risk only in terms of physical events. \nMoreover, donor agencies have shown an interest in investing in community-\nbased adaptation, recognizing that it is a valid approach to building adaptive \ncapacity in vulnerable communities. For example, at the Third Inter- national \nCommunity-Based Adaptation Workshop in Dhaka in February 2009, the Food \nand Agricultural Organization of the United Nations announced the possibility of \nproviding funding for small-scale com- munity-based adaptation projects, while \nother donors\u2014including the World Bank, the United Nations Development \nProgramme, the UK Department for Inter- national Development, and the Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency\u2014were actively engaged in \nconference discussions on the best way to achieve donor support for community- \nbased adaptation.28 \nHowever, while community-based adaptation is a vital approach to addressing the \nvulnerability of communities,29 it also presents many challenges. First, for some \nanalysts, it is unclear how much community-based adaptation differs from \ncommunity-based \u201cdevelopment\u201d in general. This lack of distinction has presented \nproblems for practitioners and funding bodies who require firmer signposts of \nsuccessful community-based adaptation projects to distinguish good practice.30 \nSecond, does community-based adaptation consist simply of local responses to \nexisting climate variability, rather than a proactive anticipation of future climate \nchange? Many community-based adaptation projects do not currently use \nprojections of climate change from research organizations or the IPCC. At the \n2009 workhop, IPCC scientists in attendance stressed the importance of consulting \nclimate modelers in community-based adaptation design.31 Yet, how useful such \ninformation can be at the community level remains an open question. Tools are \nbeing developed to improve the accessibility and relevance of downscaled \nmodeled data to community-based adaptation; for example, the weADAPT \ncollaborative32 has created the Climate Change Explorer tool, which displays \noutput from multiple climate models downscaled to a station level and also guides \nusers to help apply these data outputs in meaningful ways. An important element \nof this tool is its emphasis on the historical context of changes in climate to better \nunderstand future changes; long-term trends occur- ring in the present may in fact \nbe more important for adaptation in many cases than projected change for 2050.33 \nTools such as the Climate Change Explorer are in the early stages of development, \nand data is not yet available for all vulnerable regions. Further, as is emphasized \nby the tool itself, users must be cautious when drawing on the outputs of \ndownscaled climate change models in designing appropriate com- munity-based \nadaptation projects. From a community-based adaptation standpoint, climatic \nchanges are acknowledged by trying to understand locally observed, historic \npatterns of change in ways that are meaningful to local people. For some, this \nrepresents a strength of the approach, with proponents arguing that a focus on the \nunderlying \u201cdrivers\u201d of vulnerability so dependent on the development context \nrepresents a much-needed move away from an \u201cimpacts-based\u201d approach. Yet if \nclimate change projections are not brought into community-based adaptation \nprojects, then can they really be said to be addressing climate change, and hence \nbe seen as legitimate approaches to climate change adaptation? As noted by one \ndonor representative at the workshop, \u201cgood development is not sufficient for \nadaptation.\u201d34 \nIn turn, these questions also influence how community-based adaptation should be \nfunded. Some donors, such as the World Bank,35 have called for a greater \ninvolvement of official scientific assessments of climate change before using cli- \nmate change funds for community-based adaptation.36 Another option is to fund it \nthrough official development assistance. This option raises further challenges, \nhowever, since it may then be competing with other local development priorities. \nMoreover, funding adaptation to climate change through official development \nassistance faces strong criticisms from developing countries, who argue that cli- \nmate change is another stressor on top of (albeit exacerbating) underdevelopment, \nand it should therefore be the responsibility of industrialized countries who have \ncaused this problem to bear the brunt of the additional costs. For example, at the \nJune 2008 meeting of the subsidiary bodies to the UNFCCC, developing countries \ncalled for the measurable, reportable, and verifiable use of new and additional \nfunding for climate change\u2013specific activities (as opposed to more general \nresilience building).37 This principle is recognized by article 4.4 of the UNFCCC, \nwhich specifies that developed countries have committed to helping \u201cparticularly \nvulnerable\u201d countries meet the costs of adaptation.38 \nAnother common concern is how to make local lessons of community-based \nadaptation apply to wider spatial scales (a concept often called \u201cupscaling\u201d). \nNGOs and academic studies are currently identifying several examples of \nsuccessful projects at the scale of a household, a village, or a collection of \nvillages.39 But do these local, community-based initiatives offer lessons for how \nto adapt to climate change at the national scale, or in other countries? The \ncontextual nature of com- munity-based adaptation makes developing indicators or \nmodels problematic, risking the proliferation of a piecemeal approach that lacks \nclarity and fails to attract wider climate change and development investment. \nAccording to some analysts, the institutional design of community-based \nadaptation lies in the local deliberations that can identify development needs and \ncultural preferences, rather than the application of the same technologies or \nassumptions about livelihoods to different places.40 Indeed, one option is to take \nthe existing development assistance known as Sustain- able Livelihoods \nApproaches and sensitize these to future climate risks.41 Sustainable Livelihoods \nApproaches make households more resilient to climate shocks either by using \nmigration selectively or empowering households to intensify agriculture outputs \nand diversify economic activities. For example, in Mongla district of southern \nBangladesh, some households are reducing their vulnerability to climate by \ngaining remittances from family members working in Dhaka and growing \nfreshwater crops in the dry season and crabs in saltwater in the wet season. \nAddressing climate risk sometimes can mean reducing the dependency of income \nfrom agricultural or fishing-based activities. \nFinally, perhaps the ultimate criticism of community-based adaptation is that it \nmay not suffice in preventing some impacts of climate change. If current climate \nchange policies fail to prolong atmospheric warming at just 2 degrees Celsius, and \nif warming approaches 4 degrees or more, then it is likely that large areas of land \nwill, in time, be inundated with seawater. Relocation of villages would therefore \nbe a reality. Community- based adaptation that does not incorporate detailed \nclimate change information or communicate likely scenarios at the com- munity \nlevel may discourage the kind of technological or engineering-based approaches to \nadaptation that a community-based approach seeks to supplement. Perversely, this \ncould lead to a situation in which larger-scale strategic adaptation options that \nrespond directly to future climate change scenarios are alienated even more from \nthe communities they affect because a lack of awareness of the need for such \nprograms will make participation with local people problematic. \nSome analysts call this mismatching of 42 expectations a form of maladaptation. \nIn Bangladesh, such issues are particularly poignant because many communities \nundertaking community-based adaptation are located in areas threatened by \ninundation (see the box on page TK). \nConclusions \n\u201cGood\u201d adaptation requires consideration of immediate and long-term \nvulnerability in climatic and developmental terms. There is little point in seeking \nto adapt to likely climate risks without knowing how social and economic trends \nmake people vulnerable, or what their needs are. Yet development objectives also \nneed to incorporate projections about how climate will change. In effect, these \nrequirements imply that climate change impacts can be relevant to community- \nbased adaptation, as long as it remains first and foremost a community-driven \nprocess. It is important that interventions are consistent with climate change \nimplications and can form part of a wider cli- mate change adaptation strategy in \nwhich specific and longer-term climate change impacts can be addressed at a \nvariety of scales. \nAt the same time, scientific assessments of likely changes in climate need to be \nopen to community-based adaptation as a means of integrating concerns about \nsocial vulnerability and development with climate change policy. Especially as we \napproach the 2009 climate change negotiations in Copenhagen, where a post-2012 \ndeal on managing climate change will be reached, it is important that observers \nacknowledge the potential of community- based adaptation as an important means \nof reducing the vulnerability of the poorest communities. Policy dialogue under \nthe UNFCCC needs to be open to a new range of expertise informed by insights \nfrom vulnerable communities, generated by local stakeholders and development \nand disaster risk\u2013reduction practitioners, rather than restricted to impacts-based \nscientific inputs arising from global or national models alone. One sign of progress \ncan be seen in discussions over UNFCCC\u2019s Adaptation Fund, to support \nadaptation in developing countries that are Party to the Protocol under the \nUNFCCC. The Report of the Fifth Adaptation Fund Board Meeting in March 2009 \nnoted there was broad consensus among members that small-scale and \ncommunity-based projects should be included in funding cycles and that \ncommunity-based projects could also be submitted by governments as part of a \nmore strategic adaptation funding package.43 \nAs the community-based adaptation community grows in size and significance, it \nis likely that the lessons learned from the increasing number of case studies will \nbegin to permeate the negotiations44 and help create a better understanding of \nhow to build the resilience of the most vulnerable. \nNOTES \n1.

The small \ncommunities along the Arctic coastlines\u2028in countries such as C anada, Russia, the U nited \nStates, and Norway are located in supposedly developed zones yet include some of those \ncountries\u2019 poorest people. Moreover, Arctic people are reliant on environmental services \nthreatened by climate change. Indeed, the Arctic rim of North America is often referred \nto as climate change\u2019s canary in the coal mine, the\u2028first to experience its effects.1 O ne \nmajor problem associated with climate change is declining ice cover. The Inuit \npopulations of the Arctic rely on ice for transportation to hunt, gather food, generate \nincome, and maintain social connections, so the changing behavior of ice poses a \nsignificant threat to the Inuit way of life. \nArctic communities have always lived in conditions of environmental fragility and high \nvariability, and as a result, they have a wealth of traditional knowledge and cultural \npractices that are helping them to cope with and adapt to new challenges. For example, \nthe Inuit community of the island of Igloo- lik in Nunavut, 320 kilometers north of the \nArctic Circle, has developed many behavioral responses to climatic exposures. \nIndigenous knowledge passed from generation to generation has resulted in flexible \nhunting and harvesting techniques about what to hunt, when, and where; and how to tell \nwhen dog teams indicate thin and unsafe ice is in certain areas. People have also \ndeveloped risk-averse practices, such as taking extra supplies of food and gas on \nexpeditions and never traveling alone or on land or water where the ice seems thin. \nCritical to adaptive capacity are social networks such as extended family units, a strong \nsense of collective community responsibility, and mutual aid, all of which facilitate the \nsharing of food and equipment and ensure rapid responses to crisis.2 A study on \ndeveloping appropriate adaptation policy in Nunavut, Canada undertaken in 20063 \nrecommended that interventions to reduce vulnerability \nin the Arctic region should be developed in partnership with the local community and \ndraw on this important indigenous knowledge and existing local coping strategies. \n1.

THE \nIMPLICATIONS OF SEA-LEVEL RISE FOR THE \nCOASTAL BELT OF BANGLADESH \nThe coastal belt of Bangladesh is the site of many community-based adaptation pro- \ngrams that are responding at the community scale to problems such as waterlogging, \nsalinity intrusion, and increasing storm and cyclone severity. But what are the \nimplications of sea-level rise on this region for the sustainability of these projects in the \nlong term? Sea-level rise will result in more coastal flooding under ambient conditions \nand even more so in the event of storm surges. One prominent 2003 study suggests that a \n1 meter rise in sea level would inundate 18 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s total land, directly \nthreatening 11 percent of the country\u2019s population,1 while a 2000 World Bank report \nsuggests such a rise would flood 15\u201320 percent of the land mass and displace 20 million \npeople, mainly from the southern coastal areas.2 These projections are very possible by \nthe end of this century, with recent studies that factor in glacial melt suggesting rises of \n0.8 to 2 meters by 2100. \nIn addition, sea-level rise in conjunction with increased frequency and intensity of storms \nand cyclones has severe implications for coastal inundation in the region.\u2028A  researcher \nat the Bangladesh Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization calculated the effect \nof 2 degrees Celsius warming on a repeat of the devastating 1991 cyclone in Bangladesh, \nwhich forced a 6 meter storm surge inland over a wide area, killing at least 138,000 \npeople and leaving as many as 10 million homeless.4 The researcher found that the rise in \ntemperature was associated with a 10 percent increase in wind speed and a 0.3 meter rise \nin sea level. He estimated that this scenario would result in higher storm surges that \nwould inundate 20 percent more land than that of the 1991 cyclone. This prediction \nis particularly alarming given that climate scientists are now questioning whether the \nworld can make the rapid reduction of emissions needed to halt warming at 2 degrees \nCelsius in the face of major economic, technical, and political obstacles. Some are even \nsuggesting that warming of more than 4 degrees is much more plausible. \nIn the face of such dire implications\u2028for the region, there is a sense that com - munity-\nbased adaptation initiatives such as floating gardens and reinforced housing, while \nundeniably contributing to the short- term adaptive capacity of a small number of people \nto current climate variability, can only prove a palliative solution for a small proportion \nof the threatened population. Community-based adaptation in the region is helping people \ncope with current climatic risks, which will in turn assist in building (or limit the loss of) \nassets and entitlements that can contribute to adaptive capacity over a longer time scale. \nHowever, if they are not integrated into wider and more strategic policymaking processes \nthat addresses the longer-term and wider-scale implications of climate change, such \ninterventions can only be short term, assist a very small number of people in relation to \nthe threatened population, and may result in only coping against risks that perhaps should \nbe recognized as unmanageable without much larger interventions. Coping with added \nshocks and stresses implies that people are able to deal with these while maintaining their \noriginal (vulnerable) state but are not able to address the myriad challenges that constrain \nlives and livelihoods and make people vulnerable in the first place. Adaptation, on the \nother hand, suggests a process that reduces vulnerability and builds resilience to climatic \nstresses, facilitating more general improvements to the quality of human lives.6 \nThe authors wish to acknowledge Ian Burton for discussions that informed this section. \n1.
