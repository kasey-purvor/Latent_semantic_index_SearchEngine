Falling between a\nperiod of comparative stability, when the Radical governments of Emile\nCombes (1902\u20135) and Georges Clemenceau (1906\u20139) had dominated\npolitics, and a period of greater confusion, from 1910 to 1914, Briand\u2019s\nfirst ministry coincided with a great resurgence of optimism in French\npolitics. Combes and Clemenceau had fought battles that, according\nto republican orthodoxy, were necessary to establish the republic on\na firmer footing. Yet these battles had been divisive. A constructive\nreform agenda, led by the soft-tongued center-left politician Briand,\noffered a new tone and a new hope. The diversity of the forces that\ncoalesced in support of Briand gives his \u2018\u2018moment of hope\u2019\u2019 great sig-\nnificance for understanding the nature of republican political debate\nin the Third Republic as a whole.\nOne important reason to focus on Briand\u2019s first government is that\nthe complexity of the period from 1909 to the First World War is often\noversimplified in textbooks, where, understandably, the space for these\nyears is devoted largely to foreign affairs. There is more at stake here,\nhowever. During Briand\u2019s first ministry several strands of French politi-\ncal thought came together that have received too little attention. Ques-\ntions such as how to decentralize the state and reform the electoral sys-\ntem fascinated republicans at the time; and yet much historiography\nJulian Wright is lecturer in modern European history at the University of Durham and is pursu-\ning a large project on the political thought and activity of a broad spectrum of characters in the\nThird Republic.

From the Boulanger crisis and the Drey-\nfus affair through the political crisis of the mid-1920s and the Popu-\nlar Front, the history of the Third Republic is often written as one of\nmoments of divisions between the two great movements in French poli-\ntics, reaction and revolution.1 It is this dialectic that sets the agenda,\nand issues that do not fit its conceptualization of French politics are\noften neglected. Briand\u2019s \u2018\u2018moment of hope,\u2019\u2019 then, demonstrates the\ncomplexity of French politics.The intellectual movements and political\ndebates that are our subject here do not easily fit into the classic nar-\nrative of French political history. Thus our analysis of Briand\u2019s moment\nof hope has to be situated within a revisiting of the history of the Third\nRepublic as a whole.\nThree vital themes came together during Briand\u2019s first govern-\nment: state reform, social reform, and, underscoring both, what we\nmay call an \u2018\u2018impulse\u2019\u2019 for reconciliation. These have a relevance that\ngoes beyond the bounds of the Third Republic to the whole idea of\nthe state and social reform in contemporary France. In the wider per-\nspective, the most interesting legacies have been left by constructive\nreformers such as the social reformers of the Third Republic, the state\nplanners of the 1950s, or the advocates of decentralization since the\n1980s. A commentator of 1910 described decentralization as a theme\nthat had been pored over for decades but that always seemed new and\nstartling. How pertinent that remark is in the twenty-first century.2 Jean-\nPierre Raffarin framed his whole governmental enterprise within a mis-\nsion to decentralize and rejuvenate the republic; but this present-day\nstate reformer has roots in a belle \u00e9poque that French history has only\nrecently begun to examine.3 Thus the movement for state reform in\n1910 foreshadowed a debate still unresolved today.\nIf state reform was one of the main themes of Briand\u2019s first minis-\ntry, social reformwas its essential complement.The social reformmove-\nment dwelt on several issues, but at its heart was the attempt to improve\nlabor relations. Judith F. Stone, who has been at the forefront of work\non this movement, has shown how such ideas penetrated the Radical\n1 The classic characterization was that of the party of movement and the party of order:\nFran\u00e7ois Goguel, La politique des partis sous la IIIe R\u00e9publique, 4th ed. (Paris, 1958).\n2 Henry B\u00e9renger, in L\u2019action, May 16, 1910: \u2018\u2018Who would have thought that the idea of\nreorganizing France\u2019s administration on regional lines would have seemed a novelty, or a chimera?\nIf ever a question has been studied, discussed, elucidated over the last eighty years, it is that one.\nWell! Ask ten Frenchmen at random: you won\u2019t find three who know the first thing about it. This\nwill not stop them from shrugging their shoulders if someone, grounding their argument in tra-\ndition and reason, suggests that they can accomplish regional reform.\u2019\u2019\n3 Much of the rationale behind Raffarin\u2019s program may be found in his book Pour une nou-\nvelle gouvernance (Paris, 2002).\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 33\nParty.4 But social reform was essential to a wider group of republicans.\nBecause theRadicals were often obsessed with the defense of the repub-\nlic, there was a debate within Radicalism about whether social reform\nwas a distraction or a vital agenda that would rejuvenate the republic.\nA third theme underpins these two reform movements, that of\napaisement (appeasement). This term was not merely a slogan\u2014and it\nwas coined in domestic political debate, not in the context of inter-\nwar internationalism.5 I would argue that the word contained a seri-\nous reflection on the nature of political reform. Those who embraced\nstate reform and social reform described their politics as a \u2018\u2018construc-\ntive\u2019\u2019 politics, or a \u2018\u2018politique r\u00e9aliste\u2019\u2019 (i.e., a \u2018\u2018politics of the real\u2019\u2019 or\n\u2018\u2018politics of the possible,\u2019\u2019 rather than a \u2018\u2018cynically realist politics\u2019\u2019). In\n1910 this constructive politics was predicated on reconciliation. Indeed,\nBriand\u2019s most important contribution may have been not so much a\nprecise reform agenda as the expression of this feeling of reconcilia-\ntion and generosity.6 Yet French republicanism has never been entirely\nhappy about reconciling itself with its opponents. One commentator\nsaid that the Third Republic had failed because it could never achieve\ntrue political consensus.7 The idea of apaisement has been described,\nboth at the time and subsequently, as a nefarious attempt to build a\ncoalition of Socialists and reactionaries against the dominant Radical\nParty, which, with its concentration on the issues of universal suffrage\nand the lay state, is the most apt representative of republicanism. It is\ntime to revisit this overly cynical position. Since Fran\u00e7ois Furet\u2019s seminal\nPenser la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise, the question of the end of the Revolution\nhas been reopened.8 With this in mind, the concept of reconciliation\nmay be seen as an attempt to halt the cycle of revolution and install a\nregime of real progress and reform.Whether all republicans were ready\nfor this in 1910 is of course another matter, but for the reformers who\ncame together around Briand, the rejuvenation of the republic had to\nbegin with reconciliation.\nThese three themes, then, state reform, social reform, and the\nimpulse for reconciliation, define our understanding of Briand\u2019s first\nministry. To examine these topics, we will focus first on the intellectual\n4 Judith F. Stone, The Search for Social Peace: Reform Legislation in France, 1890\u20131914 (New\nYork, 1985).\n5 One commentator to present Briand\u2019s campaign for apaisement in a positive light was\nGeorges Bonnamour, L\u2019apaisement: Les services fran\u00e7ais d\u2019un homme d\u2019\u00e9tat (Paris, 1913).\n6 In Oct. 1910, one of Briand\u2019s correspondents described his conception of the republic as\n\u2018\u2018generous, expansive, fraternal.\u2019\u2019 Minist\u00e8re des affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res, PA-AP 335 (papiers Briand),\nvol. 25 (hereafter \u2018\u2018Briand papers,\u2019\u2019 followed by volume number).\n7 Joseph Paul-Boncour, Entre deux guerres, 3 vols.

Forster (Cambridge, 1981).\n34 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\ndiscussions that preceded Briand\u2019s appointment as pr\u00e9sident du conseil\n(president of the council, or prime minister).These can be traced back\nto the late 1890s, through the young writers and politicians who led\nthe debate. In 1910 Briand brought social and state reform together,\ngiving them the umbrella heading rajeunissement (rejuvenation), yet not\nall of the young intellectuals who had prepared the way for Briand\nwould have agreed that the two ideas could be so connected. Some con-\ncentrated on social reform and others on state reform\u2014and, as will\nbecome clear toward the end of our discussion, this dichotomy per-\nsisted through 1910 and helps explain the ultimate failure of Briand\u2019s\nenterprise. One character is particularly important to the preliminary\nstudy of intellectual precursors. Henry B\u00e9renger is interesting not only\nbecause he combined the two strands in his journalism but because\nhe had until 1906 been a most virulent advocate of the movement for\nrepublican defense that attacked the church. No appeaser, he reveled\nin the battle between right and left, and yet, during Briand\u2019s first min-\nistry he was known as the intellectual mouthpiece of the government,\ninsisting that republicans embrace reform.His commentary onBriand\u2019s\nfirst ministry is an important source for our study of the politics of\n1910, not least because it demonstrates how Radicalism itself divided\non whether to support Briand.\nHaving presented this intellectual movement and its different\nstrands, we will reintroduce the character of Aristide Briand. Although\nhe encapsulated the hope of both state reformers and social reform-\ners, he was no theorist and did not really belong to the intellectual\nmovements that placed such hope in him. His untheoretical approach\nwas important to reformers, however. They thought that one of the\nrepublic\u2019s problems was that it was obsessed with ideology and less\nconcerned with concrete results. This develops the concept we have\nalready outlined as a \u2018\u2018politique r\u00e9aliste.\u2019\u2019 The \u2018\u2018realism\u2019\u2019 of Briand and\nhis intellectual precursors is an undercurrent in our analysis here. As\nmuch as the actual reforms he proposed, Briand\u2019s emphasis on concrete\nand constructive measures is what won the young intellectuals over.\nThere is, however, an irony here that will become increasingly evident\nin our analysis. Briand was himself unable to grasp the political \u2018\u2018real-\nism\u2019\u2019 needed to make his agenda work in 1910.Ultimately, he could not\novercome the \u2018\u2018real\u2019\u2019 problem of establishing a majority in the Chamber\nthat would unequivocally support his agenda. To understand why, we\nwill have to examine the fine details of political argument in 1909, when\nBriand\u2019s program was announced in major speeches, through the elec-\ntion of May 1910, to the autumn of that year, when a railway workers\u2019\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 35\nstrike gravely weakened his position. The \u2018\u2018realist\u2019\u2019 agenda was in the\nend compromised by the \u2018\u2018realism\u2019\u2019 needed to hold his government and\nhis majority together.\nNevertheless, this moment of hope highlights several important\npoints. First, the intellectual debate was never as polarized around clas-\nsic right or left ideological positions as some historiography would have\nus believe. Second, the reform agenda as it was formulated in intel-\nlectual circles did have an impact on politics, even if in 1910 it could\nnot fulfill its agenda through politics. We should not dismiss the move-\nment behind Briand just because Briand himself was unable to achieve\nhis goals. Many characters were influential in formulating opinion in\nthe interwar period, and from there, as Nicolas Roussellier has pointed\nout, connections exist to reform agendas later in the century.9 Third,\nthe optimism that Briand inspired should not be cynically dismissed.\nThe reaction to Briand is important in itself and tells us about the way\npolitics and political ideas were received among the wider newspaper-\nreading public. Pessimism has often dominatedmodern French history,\nespecially that of the 1930s. So perhaps the time is now ripe for a con-\nsideration of one moment of hope.\nThe belle \u00e9poque \u2018\u2018reform constituency,\u2019\u2019 as Stone has described it, was\na middle-class movement for stabilizing class relations in the face of\nrevolution.10 Her presentation of the movement for solidarit\u00e9 (solidar-\nity, between classes) is convincing, particularly in light of some recent\napproaches that have distorted our understanding of these political\nreformers by equating their social reform with counterrevolution.11\nNevertheless, even Stone\u2019s analysis has some problems. Social peace was\na goal; but this was only one part of a broader reconceptualization of\nthe republican state. Some of the young intellectuals who argued over\nBriand\u2019s program in 1909\u201310 saw social reform as themost essential ele-\nment; others argued for state reforms such as administrative decentral-\nization or electoral reform. But both were more interested in adapting\nthe state to modern problems than in self-interested class politics, how-\never enlightened. Between social reform plans and state reform plans,\ntherefore, there was a community of interests, the \u2018\u2018reform constitu-\nency,\u2019\u2019 that promoted the reconciliation of class, religious, and politi-\n9 Nicolas Roussellier, \u2018\u2018La contestation du mod\u00e8le r\u00e9publicain dans les ann\u00e9es trente: La\nr\u00e9forme de l\u2019Etat,\u2019\u2019 in Le mod\u00e8le r\u00e9publicain, ed.

In this section we examine the reform movement as\nit coalesced around 1900, during the premiership of Ren\u00e9 Waldeck-\nRousseau. We then examine three aspects of the movement, stress-\ning that it benefited from an internal coherence that one commen-\ntator, B\u00e9renger, articulated with particular skill. If we are to test the\ncoherence of Briand\u2019s governmental program, it is vital to understand\nthe intellectual movement that prepared the way for his campaign of\napaisement.\nWaldeck-Rousseau, erstwhile disciple of L\u00e9on Gambetta and a\nhighly respected figure in legal circles, reluctantly took the position of\npr\u00e9sident du conseil in 1899 as the Dreyfus affair unraveled.12 Waldeck-\nRousseau is one of those figures who are often crowded out of our\nunderstanding of this period: characters such as Jean Jaur\u00e8s, Georges\nClemenceau, and Maurice Barr\u00e8s seem more colorful and thus more\nimportant. Yet for our understanding of the \u2018\u2018reform constituency\u2019\u2019\nand the ongoing projects they promoted,Waldeck-Rousseau is crucial.\nIt was not his ideological parentage in the opportunist party of the\n1880s so much as his own intellectual disciples around 1900 that pro-\nvide the key to understanding what his government was about. Around\nhim gathered an intriguing collection of young intellectuals who called\nthemselves the \u2018\u2018G\u00e9n\u00e9ration.\u2019\u201913 It is true that, from this group, a con-\nnection to the idea of middle-class defense certainly existed: Maurice\nColrat went on to found the Association de la D\u00e9fense des Classes\nMoyennes (Association for the Defense of the Middle Classes) in 1909.\nWaldeck-Rousseau, however, had a much wider agenda. He and the\nmost important of his lieutenants, the Socialist Joseph Paul-Boncour,\nwanted to move on from the period when political questions had been\ntackled using abstract principles and replace these with pragmatic or\nrealist solutions. Thus the reformers were connected by their methods\nto the opportunist politicians of the 1880s, especially Gambetta and\nJules Ferry; through them, their roots may be traced to the new sci-\nence of sociology, and to the thought of Auguste Comte in particular.\nThis school of thought stressed that the manner of reform was if any-\nthing more important than the solutions proposed. For example, the\nrapid changes brought about by the Constituent Assembly of 1789\u201391\nhad been dangerous because they had proceeded from first principles.\nHowever much one approved of the ideals of 1789, those could not in\nthemselves provide a detailed program that would reorganize the state\n12 See, in particular, Paul-Boncour, Entre deux guerres, vol. 1, chap. 3.\n13 Louis Guitard, La petite histoire de la IIIe R\u00e9publique: Souvenirs de Maurice Colrat (Paris, 1959),\nesp. chaps. 1\u20132; Christine Manigand, Henry de Jouvenel (Limoges, 2000).\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 37\nfor the twentieth century. This concern was summed up by the reform-\ners with the term politique r\u00e9aliste.\nPaul-Boncour became the preeminent theorist of this movement\nthrough the publication in 1900 of his thesis on economic federal-\nism. In it he argued that the republic must evolve by encouraging\nthe growth of professional associations. Organized where necessary on\nregional lines, this associative life would regenerate the republic.14 This\nwork established his reputation, and the Socialist minister Alexandre\nMillerand was among the eminent politicians who ensured, through a\nsubscription list, that it was published and widely read in high circles.15\nIn 1903 Paul-Boncour, an early member of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration R\u00e9gionaliste\nFran\u00e7aise (FrenchRegionalist Federation [FRF]), would open a remark-\nable debate over the question of decentralization, in which his principal\nopponent was the neomonarchist Charles Maurras.16 Thus, for Paul-\nBoncour, social reform and state reform were connected: both were\npart of what he called the \u2018\u2018rejuvenation,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018reorganization\u2019\u2019 of the\nrepublic.Ultimately, he would see social changes as preeminent, and he\ndid not give Briand his unequivocal support in 1910. Like Briand, how-\never, Paul-Boncour was guided by a concern for social and political rec-\nonciliation\u2014his 1909 entry into Parliament took place only when other\nrepublican candidates had given way, allowing him a barely contested\nelection.17\nThe \u2018\u2018G\u00e9n\u00e9ration\u2019\u2019 represented a spectrum of reform. Andr\u00e9 Tar-\ndieu, the frustrated reformer of the interwar years, worked alongside\nPaul-Boncour in Waldeck-Rousseau\u2019s offices in the Interior Ministry.18\nIn the first decade of the 1900s Tardieu was an eloquent advocate for\nthe moderate right-wing end of reformism. His article in Le temps in\nresponse to Paul-Boncour\u2019s decentralist manifesto of 1903 showed that\nhe was certainly not going to let a Socialist like his friend Paul-Boncour\nclaim all the decentralist kudos.19 Tardieu shared Paul-Boncour\u2019s view\nthat a political r\u00e9alisme was needed to allow for pragmatic reforms of the\nstate. He capitalized on the widespread use of the term r\u00e9alisme in the\n14 Joseph Paul-Boncour, Le f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme \u00e9conomique: Etude sur les rapports de l\u2019individu et des\ngroupements professionnels (Paris, 1900).\n15 Correspondence in Archives Nationales (AN), 424 AP (papiers Paul-Boncour), 1\n(doctorat).\n16 The opening salvo appeared in La renaissance latine, July 15, 1903.This article and a num-\nber of responses to it, including those of Tardieu, Clemenceau, and Maurras himself appeared\nas a collection: Joseph Paul-Boncour and Charles Maurras, Un d\u00e9bat nouveau sur la R\u00e9publique et la\nd\u00e9centralisation (Toulouse, 1905).

This advocacy, like Paul-Boncour\u2019s and Tardieu\u2019s, was in-\nspired by a larger belief in the need for a rejuvenation of the repub-\nlic. In what became a classic critique of the Third Republic, Robert de\nJouvenel expressed his generation\u2019s frustration at Parliament\u2019s failure\nto deal with administrative and electoral reform, as well as the insti-\ntution of an income tax and the need for more developed systems of\ntrade unions.21 Henri de Jouvenel connected the state reformers to high\nsociety. More of a dilettante than Tardieu or Paul-Boncour, he never-\ntheless campaigned for reform and praised Paul-Boncour lavishly in a\npamphlet published when the latter became minister of labor in 1911.22\nDuring Waldeck-Rousseau\u2019s three years in government, the issue\nthat most inspired a reform-minded intellectual like Paul-Boncour was\nthe Law on Associations, passed in 1901.This law has a threefold impor-\ntance for our analysis: first, it shows the nature of the reforms on which\nthe \u2018\u2018reform constituency\u2019\u2019 concentrated; second, it situates these re-\nformers in a longer ideological lineage, underscoring the coherence\nand depth of their ideas; and third, it demonstrates how the reformers\nconnected thoughts about social relationships to thoughts about the\nnature of the state. Indeed, the underrating of reformers like Waldeck-\nRousseau and Briand stems largely from a failure to hold the ideas of\nsocial reform and state reform alongside each other. The Law on Asso-\nciations was the work ofmen for whom these two ideas were interwoven.\nThis law forces us to accept that, by conceptualizing the two prob-\nlems as one larger question about the need for a rejuvenated republic,\nthe reformers sought neither a middle-class counterrevolution nor an\nauthoritarian coup (which Tardieu came to support only in the 1930s).\nForWaldeck-Rousseau and Paul-Boncour in 1901, as for Briand in 1910,\nthe fundamental aim was to rejuvenate the republic by reorganizing it.\nThe Law onAssociations has sometimes been cast as the prelude to\nthe separation of church and state, which dominated the agenda after\nWaldeck-Rousseau resigned in 1902. In reality, however, the law was\ndesigned to adapt the state to new social imperatives by opening a chan-\nnel between the state and the working class.

It called\ninto question the notion of the unitary state, which held that nothing\ncould come between the individual and the machinery of government.\nSince it addressed the problem of class division, it was seen as begin-\nning a new vogue of republican reform. Not through the lay education\nsystem alone would the republic implant itself in French society: the\nproponents of this law believed that it needed to revive organs at an\nintermediary level, allowing unions to play a beneficial role in society.\nPaul-Boncour had insisted in his thesis that this associationism was\nnothing less than a reorganization of the economic and social life of\nFrance on federal lines, where trades unions and regional assemblies\nwould emerge, establishing links among themselves at the regional level\nand thus becoming powerful partners in the state.The Law on Associa-\ntions therefore began the process of adapting the legal framework of\nFrench jurisprudence to promote the reorganization and rejuvenation\nof the republic.\nWe will see shortly how the personalities of 1901 reemerged in\n1909\u201310, but we should also notice the ongoing importance of the\nLaw on Associations itself. Indeed, during the first Briand govern-\nment, there was a feeling that the full benefits of the 1901 law had\nnot yet been drawn. In October 1909 Alexandre Millerand (whom\nBriand had appointed minister of commerce) ruefully recounted how\na visitor from the Canadian government had expressed surprise at\nthe persistently problematic legal and political status of trades unions\nin France. Inspired by Waldeck-Rousseau, Canada had formulated its\nown law on associations and seemed to be reaping far greater bene-\nfits than France.24 Thus when the young intellectuals around Waldeck-\nRousseau achieved positions of greater influence, the Law on Associa-\ntions remained an essential reference point.\nThe intellectual web behind this reform constituency is appar-\nently sturdy, consisting in a reformist \u2018\u2018middle way\u2019\u2019 between a desire to\nrefound the corporative society of the ancien r\u00e9gime and the unitar-\nism of Jacobin ideology. Certainly, an intellectual parentage can easily\nbe found for this movement in the writings of Alexis de Tocqueville,\n23 Paul-Boncour, Entre deux guerres, 1:120. See also 1:30\u201332. In 1901 Paul-Boncour wrote\nan extended apologia for the law in the avant-garde journal Revue naturiste (first three numbers\nof 1901).\n24 Speech given by Millerand to the electors of the twelfth arrondissement of Paris, on the\ntwentieth anniversary of his election to parliament: reported in L\u2019action, Oct. 24, 1909.\n40 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon, Auguste Comte, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Le Play, and, closer\nto hand, Jules Ferry, L\u00e9on Bourgeois, and reformist Socialists such as\nAlfred Fouill\u00e9e.Yet the ideas promoted by the young intellectuals of the\nnew century did not impinge on political debates in a straightforward\nway. Different participants in the reform debate would take up differ-\nent positions in different parties. The other dominant issues of the day,\nparticularly the question of the church, divided the reformers, and it\nwould appear that the moments when reformers came together, 1900\u2013\n1901 and 1909\u201310, were rare.Yet only by putting these moments at cen-\nter stage can we assess the significance of reform proponents such as\nBriand. We must therefore pass over the period 1902\u20139 and examine\nthe reform constituency as it reemerged during a frustrating time for\nrepublicans of all stripes.\nThis time came with the end of Clemenceau\u2019s first government\nin 1909. Clemenceau, the great critic of the unreformed republic in\nthe late nineteenth century, had himself become a force preventing\nchange: as the premier flic (top cop) of France, he repressed strikes and\nscorned regionalists while failing to reform social relations or adminis-\ntrative structures. After his resignation, the twin themes of the reform\nconstituency, state reform and social reform, reemerged. Between 1902\nand 1909, however, these themes had been developed outside the po-\nlitical arena. The important features of this development include the\nregionalist movement and the campaign for electoral reform, two ele-\nments of the movement for state reform, and the \u2018\u2018Comit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9moc-\nratie sociale,\u2019\u2019 which campaigned for social reform. Thanks to these\ngroups, questions of state reform and social reform began to figure\nprominently in political manifestos. Moreover, all three had connec-\ntions to the debate that Briand incited in 1909\u201310. Having dealt with\nthe three movements in turn, we will examine the career of B\u00e9renger,\nwho showed how state reform and social reform could be married.\nFrom 1900 to 1909 the regionalist movement worked hard to pene-\ntrate political opinion25 but was hindered somewhat by its determi-\nnation to remain nonpartisan. The names elected to the FRF\u2019s hon-\norary committee reveal its eclecticism: they included Barr\u00e8s, Charles\nLonguet (the son-in-law of Karl Marx), the old Radical deputy Charles\nBeauquier,26 the moderate Louis Marin, and the legitimist Breton dep-\nuty the Marquis de l\u2019Estourbeillon. In its early days the FRF was a some-\nwhat unfocused organization. But its secretary-general, the journalist\n25 See Wright, Regionalist Movement in France, chap. 5.\n26 Charles Beauquier, Radical Socialist deputy of the Doubs, was chairman of the Cham-\nber\u2019s Decentralization Commission under the Clemenceau government.\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 41\nand teacher Jean Charles-Brun, ensured that by 1910 the FRF had taken\na positive and pragmatic direction. The regionalists organized confer-\nences that had limited and precise objectives: to debate the economic\nproblems of the Loire Valley, for example, or to teach regional litera-\nture and history in schools. Thus regionalism had a twin face: emerg-\ning from provincial cultural and literary organizations and their avant-\ngardes in Paris, it acquired a practical outlook that could affect political\ndebates.27\nWhen Radical Socialists asked, \u2018\u2018Where next?\u2019\u2019 after the crisis over\nthe separation of church and state, a project of administrative decen-\ntralisation, taking as a model the \u2018\u2018living\u2019\u2019 regions, with their defined\neconomic and cultural identities, was a worthy part of the program.28\nBut the FRF had not succeeded in convincing all politicians of the\nLeft that it was a truly republican enterprise. Charles-Brun suggested\nin 1905 that the first task of regionalism was to unite those regional-\nists who thought like Paul-Boncour and those who thought like Maur-\nras. For him, the question of regime was in fact less fundamental than\nthe question of what sort of republic or monarchy one envisaged:\nunitary or decentralized.29 Thus Maurras was rarely attacked head-on\nby the regionalists, and when Briand himself seemed to advocate re-\ngional decentralization, the debate was confused by a constant stream\nof articles in Action fran\u00e7aise arguing that republican regionalism was\na misnomer. This did not help the regionalists\u2019 cause with Radicals\nwho advocated republican defense. Even so, regionalism had won over\nenough converts by 1910 for theMaurras-induced confusion to be less a\nproblem than such practical questions as how the decentralization pro-\ncess might work, what shape the regions would take, and how such a\nreform might affect institutions like the Senate.\nIn 1910 these questions were gathered under the heading \u2018\u2018R\u00e9-\nforme administrative.\u2019\u2019 It was \u2018\u2018R\u00e9forme \u00e9lectorale,\u2019\u2019 however, that drew\nthe most attention. Like regionalism, the \u2018\u2018RP\u00e9iste\u2019\u2019 movement (RP\nstanding for repr\u00e9sentation proportionnelle) led by Charles Benoist was\neclectic in its advocates and suffered from the technical difficulties of\nconstructing a detailed proposal for reform. The RP\u00e9istes argued that\nelectoral reform, based on a system of proportional representation,\nwas part of the program of republican rejuvenation.30 Their histori-\n27 Jean Charles-Brun, Le r\u00e9gionalisme (Paris, 1911), 37.\n28 Serge Berstein does not pursue the connection, made by the Radical Ferdinand Buisson,\nbetween electoral reform and regional decentralization, twin pillars of state reform: see Berstein,\nHistoire du Parti radical, 2 vols. (Paris, 1980), 1:58\u201367.\n29 Edmond Lizop, \u2018\u2018De la terre natale \u00e0 l\u2019humanit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale,\u2019\u2019 Politique 37 (1967): 144.\n30 Throughout 1907 the Radical Party consulted its members on electoral reform, produc-\n42 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\ncal reference point was Gambetta.31 In the 1880s the Chamber had\nput aside proportional representation to follow a two-stage constitu-\nency election model. Yet Gambetta had clearly outlined the view that\nthe system most appropriate to a mature republic was one in which all\nparties were equitably represented.32 Themovement drew support from\nmen who believed that the achievement of universal suffrage was not\nenough in itself. Jean Jaur\u00e8s and Ferdinand Buisson were among the\nmore notable figures who supported the campaign when a formal par-\nliamentary group was formed in 1907.33 It was under Briand in 1909\nthat the Chamber first debated proportional representation in detail.\nIf state reform attracted a variety of intellectuals, those who con-\ncentrated on social reform tended to have more clearly defined politi-\ncal positions. We turn now from the regionalists and RP\u00e9istes to a\ngroup that best represents the social reform theme within the intellec-\ntual movement. The Comit\u00e9 de la D\u00e9mocratie Sociale was founded in\n1906 as a \u2018\u2018study group\u2019\u2019 bringing together Radicals, Radical Socialists,\nand independent socialists who sought a new agenda for the repub-\nlic. The challenge was to move on from the question of republican\ndefense to more constructive measures. Joseph Paul-Boncour, a found-\ning member, outlined the Comit\u00e9\u2019s program: nationalization of cer-\ntain industries, a state insurance scheme, unions for state employ-\nees, and obligatory collective bargaining in industry.34 These reforms\nwere designed to bring the growing syndicalist movement closer to the\nstate. Paul-Boncour conceived them as furthering the work of Waldeck-\nRousseau\u2019s government by developing possibilities opened up by the\nLaw on Associations.\nThe two most important members of the Comit\u00e9 were the Social-\nist journalist L\u00e9on Parsons and a young law lecturer, later an eminent\neconomist, Etienne Antonelli. Parsons had become known in the 1890s\nas an advocate of reformist socialism. Around the turn of the century\nhe became an important figure in a reform socialist movement called\nL\u2019Oeuvre.35 Paul-Boncour had attended their meetings regularly, and\nwith his help Parsons brought together Radical Socialist reformers as\nthe 1902\u20136 legislature drew to a close. Parsons was the group\u2019s publi-\ning a majority in favor of limited change, with some clearly against and others, led by Buisson,\nstrongly supportive of proportional representation.

In 1911 he gave classes at the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques\net Sociales on \u2018\u2018Les actions de travail dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s anonymes \u00e0 par-\nticipation ouvri\u00e8re.\u2019\u201936 His studies on political economy and socialist\nphilosophy gave La d\u00e9mocratie sociale a serious academic tone. In 1924\nhe was elected to Parliament from the Haute-Savoie.While his inclina-\ntions were clearly on the left (throughout the period he wrote for Le\npeuple, organ of the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale duTravail), it was above all\nAntonelli\u2019s status as a distinguished economist that defined his political\ncontribution: he reported the budget for social insurance from 1924\nto 1931.\nThe loose and anonymous group of left-leaning politicians that\noriginally met at the Comit\u00e9 in 1906 included many disaffected Radi-\ncals.Yet the struggle to make Radicals more aware of the need for social\nreform did not take place in the 1906\u201310 legislature, for all the pressure\nthat Paul-Boncour, Antonelli, and Parsons had applied at the outset. It\nwas not easy to oppose the strikebreaking Clemenceau when their own\npatrons, notably Briand himself, held cabinet seats. Only whenClemen-\nceau fell in 1909 did the group resurface. The bureau of the Comit\u00e9\norganized a general assembly at the Caf\u00e9 Cardinal, their old meeting\nplace, for July 1909.37 La d\u00e9mocratie sociale appeared a few months later,\nits first number coinciding fortuitously with a major speech given by\nBriand at P\u00e9rigueux.38 With Briand at the head of government, the\nComit\u00e9 could now claim\u2014as it never could in 1906\u2014to be a discussion\ngroup with a real chance of influencing policy. No longer, its members\nhoped, would their plans emerge in projects buried in those \u2018\u2018ossuaries\nof the republic,\u2019\u2019 the commissions of the Chamber; now they could pro-\nvide the intellectual cohesion behind a whole governmental program.\nThe first issue of the newspaper reiterated the principles that un-\nderlay all discussion of social or state reform. It was not proportional\nrepresentation or collective bargaining per se that mattered but the\nprocess by which such measures were introduced. \u2018\u2018We do not want to\ncreate a new party,\u2019\u2019 wrote the editor; \u2018\u2018rather, we want to bring new\n36 A special issue of the Revue d\u2019histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale in 1953 was devoted to Anto-\nnelli.

It was published in their journal under the heading\n\u2018\u2018La politique r\u00e9aliste.\u2019\u201941 There was more to this than merely a platform\ndesigned to unite a left and center-left majority, in a tactical restruc-\nturing of the Radicals and independent socialists. \u2018\u2018Realism\u2019\u2019 defined an\napproach to politics that steered away from the rhetoric of classic Radi-\ncalism: \u2018\u2018This state of mind is a fear and rejection of any a priori formula\nimposing itself on governmental and legislative action. . . . the govern-\nmentmust place itself face-to-face with present reality, and consider the\nsocial body as a living organism.\u2019\u201942\nOn the question of which reform, in this \u2018\u2018realist\u2019\u2019 approach, was\nthe most pressing, the Comit\u00e9 emphasized social reform over reform\nof the state. But the Comit\u00e9 was not the only part of the reform move-\nment that hoped to gain ground under Briand. Some of the force of the\nComit\u00e9\u2019s argument was lost when the press fell to debating in minute\ndetail the question of proportional representation. Paul-Boncour was\nby early 1910 writing a weekly article in the Socialist journal La lanterne,\nwhere strong opposition to electoral reform was often voiced. He had\nto steer his articles away from the issue of state reform. Not all of his\nreaders would have seen the connection between his moderate social-\nism, on the one hand, and regionalism or the RP\u00e9iste campaign, on the\nother. Meanwhile, Parsons and Antonelli turned to a specific question,\n\u2018\u2018Les actions du travail dans les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de participation ouvri\u00e8re.\u2019\u201943\nThey argued that social reformhad to proceed by forging links between\nworkers and employers, to the workers\u2019 advantage. Participation meant\nparticipation in the fruits of industry. On this question, one of their\nprincipal authorities was Briand himself, who in 1906 had led a discus-\nsion about it at the Comit\u00e9.\nThe intellectual who brought together the twin themes of the re-\n39 La d\u00e9mocratie sociale, Oct. 16, 1909.\n40 Ibid.\n41 La d\u00e9mocratie sociale, Dec. 11, 1909.\n42 Ibid.\n43 Etienne Antonelli, Les actions du travail (Paris, 1912).\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 45\nform movement was B\u00e9renger. He was not, so far as we can tell, a\nkey member of the Comit\u00e9 de la D\u00e9mocratie Sociale\u2014he was a little\nolder, and perhaps the generational difference was as important as\nany.44 Like other reform advocates, B\u00e9renger had reflected not merely\non the actual reforms that were needed but on the methods of repub-\nlican rejuvenation. He insisted that the strength of the reform move-\nment lay in its pragmatic approach to change. In a 1907 lecture B\u00e9ren-\nger argued that there could be no specific recipe for social reform, but\nthat gradualism was absolutely essential: \u2018\u2018The libre penseur (freethinker)\ndoes not bring the complete solution to the social problem; he works\nlittle by little, with the majority of the country, to bring the masses,\nuneducated and unaware, to an understanding of social problems and\nfrom there to increasing the happiness of each individual.\u2019\u201945 Reform\ndemanded laborious attention and study, but the results of such work\nwould be more fruitful than those produced in the airy castles of doc-\ntrinaire Socialists or reactionaries. B\u00e9renger, then, saw both social and\nstate reforms as rooted in a realist political practice\u2014that is, as rejecting\nthe methods if not the ideals of the constitution makers in 1789.\nIt is important to keep an open mind as to the political impact of\ndifferent elements of the reform movement. Through his newspaper\nL\u2019action, B\u00e9renger pressed the government on the necessity of repub-\nlican rejuvenation. Yet he bridged the gap between intellectual and\npolitical debates in another, fundamental way. B\u00e9renger\u2019s Radical cre-\ndentials were as solid as any: between 1901 and 1906 he had established\nhimself as one of the most virulent anticlericals in the French press.\nThe death of his brother, fighting for France overseas, inspired B\u00e9ren-\nger to conceive a passionate belief in the ideal of the unified, national\nrepublic.46 National fulfillment would come through the triumph of the\nfreethinking republic over the church and the Right. There can have\nbeen few more virulent scourges of the church than B\u00e9renger: the lec-\ntures and articles he produced throughout the separation crisis chan-\nneled a torrent of criticism of Christianity in general and Catholicism in\nparticular.47 Like Paul-Boncour, B\u00e9renger had been a \u2018\u2018leader of youth\u2019\u2019\nthroughout the Dreyfus affair and afterward. His newspaper, L\u2019action,\nwas founded specifically to promote uncompromising anticlericalism.48\n44 B\u00e9renger was president of the Association G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Etudiants de Paris when Paul-\nBoncour joined it in the 1890s; Paul-Boncour, Entre deux guerres, 1:60.\n45 Speech to the Universit\u00e9 Populaire de Lille, delivered Dec. 1, 1907.

As early as\n1901 he had embraced the call for electoral reform on the basis of pro-\nportional representation.49 In 1906 he demanded that the Radicals turn\nfrom the religious to the social question.50 The battle was now between\nproletariat and plutocracy, he argued. The 1906\u201310 legislature had to\ninaugurate the social republic by introducing working-class pensions,\nan income tax, and the development of a more organized network of\nunions. By 1909 B\u00e9renger had associated himself clearly with Briand\u2019s\nagenda.51 Thus the notion that the reform movement, as led by Briand,\nwas merely an attempt to move the governmental center of gravity to\nthe right, toward the Catholic-friendly progressistes, is undermined by\nthe evidence of B\u00e9renger. Moreover, he saw the two streams of reform,\nstate reform and social reform, as complementary. Great emphasis thus\nneeds to be placed on the articles B\u00e9renger wrote during Briand\u2019s first\ngovernment, as they allow us to sharpen our focus on the intellectual\nmovement and witness, close up, the application of this intellectual\nmovement in the arena of political debate. B\u00e9renger is a crucial figure\nfor treating Briand\u2019s concept of apaisement seriously.\nThus, by the autumn of 1909, when Briand was encouraging the\ndebate on state reform, a large and diverse constituency of reform-\nminded intellectuals had emerged. It might be questioned how much\nbearing this movement had on politics. Nevertheless, through the com-\nplex web of their personal connections, we can see B\u00e9renger and Anto-\nnelli, for example, exercising an important influence on political de-\nbate. Unlike some intellectual movements of the period (one thinks\nperhaps of Action fran\u00e7aise or the supporters of the anarchist Gustave\nHerv\u00e9), thesemen had a personal impact on the heart of the republican\ndebate. Reformism, an intellectual movement, drew its support from\nthe Left Bank academic and artistic world, but its chief proponents\nwere close to the leading politicians of the day and helped form opin-\nion through their journalism. Many of them played a role in the higher\nadministration, as did Paul-Boncour, chef de cabinet (head of administra-\ntion) in the newly founded Ministry of Labor in 1906.

As we\nshall see after analyzing the debates of 1910 more closely, the main issue\nfacing this reformmovement was that of reconciliation. It was not social\nso much as religious reconciliation that caused problems.\nIn any consideration of Briand, the question of religious reconciliation\nnaturally takes center stage. Briand first came to the attention of the\npublic at large as the man charged with applying the separation laws,\nwhich he did with a deliberate policy of conciliation. Conciliation would\nremain his watchword in 1909. The development of his new agenda,\ncentered on the term apaisement, has commonly been analyzed in three\nimportant speeches he gave in Neubourg in March 1909, in P\u00e9rigueux\nin October 1909, and in Saint-Chamond in April 1910. In the work of\nhis principal biographer, Georges Suarez, Briand emerges as a supple\npolitician testing the water of state reform through certain popular\nideas.52 What we do not see, however, is the intellectual cohesion that\nunderpinned these ideas. That is why we have dwelled so long on the\nreform constituency prior to 1909, leaving our central character in the\nwings until the serious and cohesive nature of these ideas has been\nestablished.\nA century after his appearance on the French political scene, Bri-\nand remains a poorly known figure.53 If any part of his career has been\nstudied in detail, it is his activity on behalf of the League of Nations\nfrom 1919 to 1932. The advocate of the general strike of 1900, the\nvoice of moderation in the separation crisis of 1905, the orator who\nseduced the Chamber on so many occasions in the prewar years are\nwritten about in passing. Suarez was himself discredited by his activity\nduring the Second World War, and Briand\u2019s reputation suffered as a\nresult.54 Even at the time of his death in 1932, however, Briand had\nreceded from the center stage of politics. His efforts for international\ncooperation in the 1920s had seemed to lead nowhere. A significant\nleap of the imagination is needed to overcome these later impressions\nand revive the sense of optimism that Briand inspired in 1909\u201310. The\nwriter Vercors recounts a conversation between his parents and a Hun-\ngarian diplomat in 1909: \u2018\u2018My parents were sorry that Europe had, for\n52 Georges Suarez, Briand: Sa vie, son oeuvre, avec son journal et de nombreux documents in\u00e9dits,\n6 vols.

At this, in his\ndeep voice, the King\u2019s councillor protested: \u2018You, you have Brriand!\n[sic].\u2019 \u2019\u201955\nTo the Socialist Party, Briand was already a turncoat, and his\nactions in 1910 would only exacerbate this sense of betrayal. He had\nentered the world of political journalism writing for La lanterne in the\n1890s, and he was elected from Saint-Etienne, the industrial mining\narea, in 1902. Yet his acceptance of a ministerial portfolio under Cle-\nmenceau suggested, as he had done in his work on the separation laws,\nthat here was a bourgeois lawyer, much beloved of the ladies of the\ntheater, who had other agendas than the class struggle. Nevertheless,\nthe wave of enthusiasm that greeted Briand\u2019s declarations at Neubourg,\nand particularly the first government statement of July 1909, has often\nbeen dismissed. \u2018\u2018As soon as we talked of appeasement and d\u00e9tente,\npeople put their faith in us,\u2019\u2019 Briand declared at Saint-Chamond. \u2018\u2018Why?\nBecause this is a time when the country feels a great, an irresistible,\nlonging for union, concord, and fraternity.\u2019\u201956 He was not making this\nup: letters that survive from this period indicate that republicans of all\ncolors saw promise in his program.57 In the country at large he inspired\nhope and confidence.\nTo follow the themes of the reform constituency through Briand\u2019s\nfirst government, we must consider both the intellectual movement\noutside the chamber and the political debate animated by Briand him-\nself. Only by doing so can we understand fully the central problem\nfacing Briand: how to turn a corpus of reform ideas that had acquired\ngreat cohesion in intellectual circles into a reform program that would\nhold together in Parliament. The RP\u00e9istes and regionalists, the social\nreformers, and B\u00e9renger himself all greeted Briand\u2019s moment of hope\nwith excitement and some trepidation, as they witnessed their ideas\nbeing taken up in the wider press and in Parliament.Thus the individu-\nals we have examined in the first half of this article reemerge as players\non the fringe of the political debate that concerns us from here on. An\nimportant subtheme is Briand\u2019s enigmatic position between intellectu-\nals and politicians. In trying to understand this position, we are in fact\naddressing one of the quintessential problems of Third Republic poli-\ntics: the relationship between Parliament and the politically educated\nclass outside Parliament.\nIn March 1909, at Neubourg, Briand astonished the political world\n55 Vercors, Moi, Aristide Briand: Essai d\u2019autoportrait (Brussels, 1993), 10.\n56 Suarez, Briand, 2:240.\n57 The correspondence between Briand and Reinach is particularly telling. See Briand\npapers, vol. 27, and below.\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 49\nby talking of participation and social democracy as a means to recon-\nciliation. It was Benoist and the Right who first accused him of political\nskullduggery, a charge that would be so often repeated by politicians\u2014\nand later, historians\u2014of the Left.58 The social Catholic politicianAlbert\nde Mun peevishly noted that the new government was taking up many\nof his ideas. But the Radicals who had become utterly disenchanted\nwith Combes, as they had grown anxious about Clemenceau as the\nnation\u2019s \u2018\u2018top cop,\u2019\u2019 were elated. Independent socialists such as Mille-\nrand were not difficult to bring on board. The up-and-coming Radical\nEdouard Herriot saw the program as substantive and serious.59\nAt P\u00e9rigueux Briand developed his themes, particularly that of\nworkers participating in the fruits of their labor. He envisaged a much\ngreater organization of labor, where unions would become \u2018\u2018march\u00e9s de\ntravail\u2019\u2019 (work exchanges). It was Briand\u2019s remarks on the \u2018\u2018mares stag-\nnantes,\u2019\u2019 however, that made this speech memorable. The little ponds\nwere the arrondissements with their cossetted deputies and their petty\ninfighting; the wind that blew over them was that of state reform. To\nsuggest, as did David E. Sumler, that this was no more than the win-\ndow dressing for a cynical attempt to build a coalition that would keep\nthe Radical Socialist Joseph Caillaux out of office, building bridges to\nthe right under the cloak of apaisement, is to attribute to Briand a level\nof subtlety that even he did not fully merit.60 This speech was a sin-\ncere attempt to describe to the electorate the hope that Briand had for\nthe future. Gabriel Hanotaux\u2019s Carnets substantiates this less skeptical\ninterpretation: \u2018\u2018He seriously wanted, I think, to bring together all the\nrepublican party; he had no illusions about the force that moderates\nwould bring him. But I think that he wanted above all to obtain their\nsupport for social laws that the Radical Party, meager and fractious,\nwould refuse him.\u2019\u201961 The complication arose because Briand developed\npolicies on the basis of their necessity and the benefits they seemed\nto offer the French nation as a whole. This realism was in fact at the\nheart of the program of state reform, and it explains why Briand was\ngreeted with such enthusiasm: the Radicals\u2019 time in office had been\ndisappointing because Combes and Clemenceau had clung doggedly\nto the abstract principles of revolutionary republicanism, avoiding the\nreal problems of society.\n58 Charles Benoist, Souvenirs, vol. 3, 1902\u201333 (Paris, 1934), 158.\n59 Marie-Georges D\u00e8zes, \u2018\u2018Participation et d\u00e9mocratie sociale: L\u2019exp\u00e9rience Briand de\n1909,\u2019\u2019 Le mouvement social, no. 87 (1974): 114, 117.\n60 David E.

G. Dethan (Paris, 1982), 42.\n50 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\nAs the 1906\u201310 legislature drew to a close, many young reform-\ners expressed their disappointment in its achievements. Clemenceau\u2019s\nconfrontation with the winegrowers of the Languedoc had turned him\naway from the regional reform projects he had earlier condoned.62 One\nmajor reform, the creation of France\u2019s first workers\u2019 pension scheme,\nhad passed through theChamber, only to be left languishing in the Sen-\nate until the very last moment.63 Moreover, the bureaus of the Chamber\nwere filling up with such projects as the decentralization commission\nchaired by Charles Beauquier. This commission, set up by Clemen-\nceau, had produced a project to which some Radicals seemed favor-\nable.64 Nothing had come of it, however, and it remained to be seen\nwhat Briandwould dowith administrative reform and the other reforms\nthat were increasingly pressing for attention, such as a new statute on\nthe position and authority of trade unions. In particular, Briand had\nequivocated on the issue of the \u2018\u2018mares stagnantes,\u2019\u2019 adjourning fur-\nther debate on electoral reform until the question was better under-\nstood. This led both Benoist and later historians to see Briand\u2019s politi-\ncal maneuvering during this period as evidence that he was not fully\ncommitted to \u2018\u2018RP,\u2019\u2019 and that it was for him no more than a slogan.65\nBriand did believe in the need for gradual reform, however. It was in\nkeeping with his conception of the main problem of politics: that last-\ning reform could never come from projects imposed rapidly, a priori,\non the nation. His correspondence reveals not only that he took more\nthan just a passing interest in electoral reform but that he had occa-\nsional contacts with Benoist himself, which the latter\u2019s memoirs do not\nrecall.66\nThe intellectual thrust behind the debate that Briand animated\nwas provided by B\u00e9renger, who in his review of the P\u00e9rigueux speech\nadvocated all of Briand\u2019s measures, notably the idea of the trade union\n62 See Clemenceau\u2019s article in Paul-Boncour and Maurras, D\u00e9bat nouveau.\n63 In La lanterne, Mar. 5, 1910, Paul-Boncour described this as an unexpected development\nthat gave the legislature a better end-of-term report than it merited.\n64 Cruppi, in Le matin, Dec. 20, 1909. Cruppi had moved from progressivism in 1898 to\nmembership in the Radical Socialist group in 1910\u2014an evolution that provides a clue to his inter-\nest in reforms about which the Jacobins of his party were more nervous. J. Joly, ed., Dictionnaire des\nparlementaires fran\u00e7ais (Paris, 1960), 1192.\n65 Benoist would, in his memoirs, accuse Briand of not being a true supporter of electoral\nreform. Like the adept parliamentarian he was, he had simply moistened his finger to find \u2018\u2018the\ndirection from which the wind was blowing on the stagnant ponds\u2019\u2019 (Benoist, Souvenirs, 3:158).\nBenoist\u2019s memoirs, however, are notorious for the bitterness with which the failed reformer, who\nhad by the time of writing become sympathetic to the extreme Right, sneered at the core of the\nrepublican party. Briand was, moreover, an easy target in 1934, and not only because he was no\nlonger alive to answer the criticisms: the rise of Hitler had shown his international policy to have\nbeen overly optimistic, and this colored the judgment of writers, such as Benoist, whose memories\nof the prewar period had become clouded with disappointment.\n66 See Briand papers, vol. 25.\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 51\nas a \u2018\u2018work exchange\u2019\u2019 in which capital and labor could cooperate.\nB\u00e9renger turned his criticism on the Radical Party, which, he said,\n\u2018\u2018must rejuvenate, renew itself; it must stop feeding on narrow formulas,\nworrying itself about tendencies and subtendencies, which perhaps had\ntheir purpose yesterday but today no longer correspond to the reality\nof things.\u2019\u201967 The Radical Party was meeting at Nantes that very week,\nand B\u00e9renger connected Briand\u2019s speech with a published letter pro-\ngram addressed to the Radicals by L\u00e9on Bourgeois.68 The battle line in\npolitical circles was now clear. On one side were Camille Pelletan, Emile\nCombes, and many Radicals for whom the business of the government\nconsisted largely in the strengthening of republican mores through the\ndefense of the education system. On the other were some Radicals,\nsuch as Ferdinand Buisson and L\u00e9on Bourgeois, with a number of inde-\npendent socialists led by Briand himself. In his New Year\u2019s Day article\nof 1910, B\u00e9renger described the two poles of the republican Left in\nterms of the governments of the previous year\u2014a year of two halves:\n\u2018\u2018The first half was filled by the last phase of the Clemenceau ministry,\nthat is, by the burying of fiscal reform, by the strike of communications\nworkers, by mass sackings of civil servants, by multiple vexations against\nthe whole world of labor, and finally by the fall of the dictator. . . .\nThe second was marked by the inauguration of a new politics of social\nappeasement and republican d\u00e9tente that spontaneously reestablished\ndiscipline in the administration and freedom in the country.\u2019\u201969\nBetween these two poles, Clemenceau\u2019s republican defense and\nBriand\u2019s republican appeasement, many politicians could vacillate.This\nwas partly because Briand himself was not a doctrinaire advocate of\nany specific measure\u2014he was too cautious. Not all who might have\nbeen expected to side with him did so. One might have thought that\nPaul-Boncour would align himself directly with the government, but\nhe did not. His own principal sponsor, Maurice Berteaux, was one\nof the government\u2019s harshest critics during the debate of June 1910.\nPaul-Boncour remained connected to his old friends from La d\u00e9mocratie\nsociale, but he would eventually attempt to found his own grouping, situ-\nated more clearly on the socialist left.70 Briand had to strike the right\nbalance: the rhetoric of republican rejuvenation had to be enunciated\nwith great delicacy.\nThus B\u00e9renger\u2019s propaganda campaign was crucial. It attempted\n67 L\u2019action, Nov. 11, 1909.\n68 L\u2019action, Nov. 12, 1909.\n69 L\u2019action, Jan. 1, 1910.\n70 AN 424 AP (papiers Paul-Boncour), vol. 8, has many reports on the \u2018\u2018Parti r\u00e9publicain\nsocialiste,\u2019\u2019 which held its first congress in Feb. 1914.\n52 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\nto provide the intellectual coherence for a republican, anticlerical ma-\njority that would follow Briand. For many republicans, however, the\nultimate question in politics was the extremely mundane issue of where\nin the Chamber one would draw the line between reaction and revolu-\ntion, between right and left\u2014and howmuch of the gray area in between\nwould have to be covered by a government program for a workable\nmajority to be built in support of it. There could thus be a dangerous\ndislocation between rhetoric designed to shore up the government\u2019s\nsupport in the intellectual reform constituency\u2014that is, outside the\nChamber\u2014and the rhetoric as heard by Radicals inside the Chamber.\nWhen Briand called for electoral reform, was he trying to build a new\nforward-thinking party of the Left out of the stagnating Radical and\nindependent socialist groups, or did he seek a broader coalition that\nincluded conniving clericalists? Read outside Parliament, the speeches\nwere interpreted in the former, positive manner; inside, they were seen\nas a nefarious attempt to woo conservatives. Playing to the gallery of\nwider opinion, Briand appeared sincere, but he neglected the pettifog-\nging Radical deputies at his peril.\nWhen Briand delivered his next major speech, at Saint-Chamond\nduring the election campaign of April 1910, some commentators were\nmore skeptical about the government\u2019s ability to bring about change.\nMany, however, remained enthusiastic. Perhaps this was because of the\nmagnetic aura that Briand projected not only in his speeches but also\nin the glowing reports published by most of the republican press. In\nany case, the pressure for reform and the proposals the government\nput forward in its declaration of June 1910 can be fully understood\nonly if we accept that there was a strong body of intellectual opinion\nbehind them.\nHow broad Briand\u2019s coalition had to be hinged on how well the\nRadical Party did in the 1910 elections. If it won a great preponderance\nof seats, the government would be able to bring many undecided Radi-\ncals behind its new agenda. If it did less well, the need to broaden the\nbasis of the government\u2019s majority might lead, if not to the courting\nof the Right by Briand, then at least to a sense among some Radicals\nthat he was building an unholy alliance of Socialists and progressistes.\nThose accusations were indeed made; but the election campaign itself\nwas fought with the Radical Party following a line sympathetic to that\nlaid out by Briand at Saint-Chamond.71 This was in part thanks to the\nefforts of L\u00e9on Bourgeois and Ferdinand Buisson at the Radical Party\n71 B\u00e9renger described the Radical manifesto as a natural complement to the Saint-\nChamond speech: L\u2019action, Apr. 13, 1910.\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 53\ncongress, the former seeing in Briand\u2019s overtures the natural extension\nof his own philosophy of \u2018\u2018solidarit\u00e9.\u2019\u201972\nMeanwhile, B\u00e9renger kept up the press campaign for appease-\nment. According to him, Briand\u2019s government should institute both\nelectoral and administrative reform simultaneously.They were the pre-\nrequisites for any republican rejuvenation, since as long as the Chamber\nwas in thrall to arrondissement election committees, no generous over-\nhaul of the system could be expected. During the latter stages of the\n1910 election campaign, and in the period after the elections while the\ngovernment was drawing up its new program, B\u00e9renger wrote a stream\nof articles on the issues of electoral reform and administrative reform\nin particular. Social reforms such as the introduction of an income tax\nand the development of the legal status of unions were, he argued, con-\ntingent on state reform.73 It was clear that even the initial reforms were\nfar from simple, however. At the Radical congress, B\u00e9renger had spo-\nken in favor of an electoral regime based on the scrutin de liste r\u00e9gional\n(regional party list), and he admitted that it would be illogical to make\nsuch changes without establishing the regions. These had a shadowy\neconomic and industrial existence already, he argued, but this needed\nto be consolidated.74 For B\u00e9renger, regionalism was a long-ripening\nfruit now necessary for the growth of the republic.75\nThe intellectual campaign impinged on politics through the mani-\nfestoes of the candidates: the regionalists constantly cited the 412 depu-\nties who had put administrative reform on their manifestos.The region-\nalist leader Charles-Brun\u2019s scrapbook of articles covering the spring\n1910 debate shows just how caught up the press was with the issue.\nRegional reform was eclipsed only by electoral reform as a topic of\ndebate.76 Within the Radical mainstream, for every Camille Pelletan\nwho opposed regional reform, there was a Charles Beauquier who dem-\nonstrated that the regional reform they conceived was eminently \u2018\u2018Radi-\ncal\u2019\u2019: it adapted the one and indivisible republic to its modern economic\nconcerns.\nAs the project\u2019s complexity became more widely understood, how-\never, the regionalists, realizing that it probably would not be presented\nto Parliament, reverted to their more cautious position.They wanted to\n72 See Jack Hayward, \u2018\u2018Solidarity: The Social History of an Idea in Nineteenth-Century\nFrance,\u2019\u2019 International Review of Social History 4 (1959): 261\u201384.\n73 L\u2019action, May 10, 1910.\n74 Articles by B\u00e9renger in L\u2019action, May 13\u201316, 1910.\n75 L\u2019action, May 14, 1910.\n76 Scrapbook in the Archives Charles-Brun, Mus\u00e9e des Arts et Traditions Populaires, Paris,\nbox 18.\n54 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\navoid a repeat of the top-down administrative reforms of the Constitu-\nent Assembly and to follow the \u2018\u2018realist\u2019\u2019 way of reform, that is, reform\nslowly, with both ears tuned to the voice of public opinion, and thus\nmake the reforms organic rather than abstract. \u2018\u2018We can\u2019t do it on the\nhoof, in a fit of typical French enthusiasm,\u2019\u2019 wrote one of B\u00e9renger\u2019s col-\nlaborators at L\u2019action; \u2018\u2018we have to elaborate it with care and over time.\nThe efforts of a whole legislature [four years] would not be too long.\u2019\u201977\nMoreover, a consensus seemed to be developing among all but the fully\npaid-up members of the FRF that electoral reform ought to be intro-\nduced before administrative reform, not least because the Chamber as\na whole had more expertise on that question and would more easily for-\nmulate a coherent response. There was talk of a regional decentraliza-\ntion, using thirty-six regions: but the government made no specific dec-\nlaration to this effect, and the regionalists themselves were wary about\nseeing such a reform introduced without a lengthy period of consulta-\ntion and study.78\nThe question of electoral reform, however, definitely attracted the\nnew Chamber\u2019s attention. By the end of May, B\u00e9renger had thrown\ndown his own gauntlet: electoral reform would be brought before the\nChamber at once, whisked through a commission, and voted by the end\nof the year; the Senate should finish its overlong deliberation on the\nincome tax; and a measure granting greater statutory rights to fonction-\nnaires should be passed as well.79 Hehad clearly been in close touch with\nthe inner circle of the cabinet, since he correctly foretold that the gov-\nernment\u2019s electoral reform project would include a six-year mandate\nfor deputies and the renewal of the Chamber by thirds.\nThe government program was brought to the Chamber by Briand\non June 9. B\u00e9renger grew exasperated as the debate was clogged up by\ninterminable interpellations, many of which seemed to have little bear-\ning on the details of the program. The main groups in the Chamber\nused the debate on the government\u2019s declaration as an excuse to estab-\nlish their own identities, and their own position within Parliament.The\nsocialistes unifi\u00e9s, for example, presented new young deputies as their\nchampions, including Albert Thomas, later known for his labor orga-\nnizing during the First World War. The Socialists\u2019 speeches were often\ngeneral statements of Marxist dogma, advanced without any real atten-\ntion to the precise issues raised by Briand. More generally, deputies\non the center-left sounded the clarion calls of the republic: la\u00efcit\u00e9 (the\n77 Aulard, in L\u2019action, May 26, 1910.\n78 See Charles-Brun, in Le m\u00e9morial art\u00e9sien, May 26, 1910.\n79 L\u2019action, May 27, 1910.\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 55\ndoctrine of the secular state), republican defense, and the defense of\nuniversal suffrage were constantly trumpeted from the tribune. Oratory\nseemed to be at a greater premium than constructive reform.\nWe must examine this debate in some detail to correct the false\nimpression that Briand\u2019s programwas a dangerouslymoderate platform\nthat sought to undermine the republican advance of the previous ten\nyears. It has been suggested that only the Right gave unequivocal sup-\nport to Briand\u2019s declaration and that the debate was thus a struggle\nbetween republican vacillation and republican defense.80 Others have\ntied this analysis to the developing crisis of national security and the\nrise of nationalism, suggesting that Briand was but a staging post on the\nway to the conservative Raymond Poincar\u00e9 and his \u2018\u2018nationalist\u2019\u2019 victory\nin the presidential elections of 1913.81 Briand and Poincar\u00e9 may have\nshared an interest in state reform, but the argument for such a pro-\ngram could draw its strength as well from syndicalist or independent\nsocialist sources as it could from the Right. The obsession with placing\nprojects and politicians on a sliding scale from left to right has clouded\nthe real nature of the political debate at this crucial period of the Third\nRepublic.\nWe should reiterate the distinction between the political rheto-\nric Briand used in the Chamber to establish his majority and the lan-\nguage he used before the country as a whole at Neubourg, P\u00e9rigueux,\nor Saint-Chamond. Remarks to this wider audience did not need to be\nas precise: they were designed to develop a public debate, not merely to\ndevise a parliamentary agenda. A declaration in the Chamber entailed\nmore specific rhetorical gestures, since, from the socialistes unifi\u00e9s to the\nnationalists, a great variety of political languages were spoken, each\nwith its own key reference points. So it was relatively easy for Briand\nto speak to the country as a whole at Saint-Chamond about his plan\nfor republican rejuvenation based on state reform leading to social re-\nform. In Parliament, however, each element of the programwould elicit\npraise or derision from different sections of the hemicycle. Regional\nreform, for example, had become a commonsense measure for many\nrepublicans, but in Parliament such commonplaces became bones of\ncontention. A regionalist proposal advanced by a man of the Left could\nbe cynically approved by the Right if the latter suspected that other ele-\nments of the Left would react against it and provoke the collapse of the\ngovernment. If such a measure were couched in terms of the defense\nof the lay republic and subordinated to further measures protecting\n80 Maurice Bourjol, Les institutions r\u00e9gionales de 1789 \u00e0 nos jours (Paris, 1969), 151n2.\n81 Most notably Sumler, \u2018\u2018Domestic Influences.\u2019\u2019\n56 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\nschools from a Catholic resurgence, the Jacobins in the Radical Party\nmight in turn have come to support it (as of course B\u00e9renger had done).\nIn his June 9 speech to theChamber, Briand erred by using rhetori-\ncal devices appropriate to the wider debate in a context that called for a\nsubtler approach. After all, the first necessity was political: the govern-\nment needed to establish its majority, particularly after elections whose\nresults were at best confusing, for all that they reconfirmed the repub-\nlican victory. A more straightforward program of republican defense,\nwhich would unite the Radicals and Radical Socialists, would not have\nresponded to the great pressure in the country for republican rejuvena-\ntion. Thus Briand adopted a rather dangerous tactic. He advanced his\nprogram using the rhetoric of rejuvenation rather than that of republi-\ncan defense.This at once raised the hackles of many Radicals, who were\nangered by the applause generated on center-right benches.\nBriand did call for a republican majority, however.82 Notwithstand-\ning the outrage expressed by some Radicals and socialistes unifi\u00e9s, he\nclearly stated that his government would seek to preserve the achieve-\nments of the republic, notably its \u2018\u2018conqu\u00eates la\u00efques\u2019\u2019 (secular victo-\nries), and he insisted that the lay education systemwas nothing less than\nthe cornerstone of the republic. It was the earlier part of his speech that\ncaused themost problems.He had begun by reflecting that the forces of\nreaction had been neutralized and that republicans had to respond to\nthe call for reform.The question hinged on whether they would accept\nthat the old battle against clericalism was indeed won. Turning first to\nthe Far Left, Briand called for a halt to the practice of one-upmanship,\nwhich so often plagued the closing weeks of a legislature. The country\ndemanded social reform and would no longer tolerate tactics that pre-\nvented it. He demanded a more responsible attitude to the process of\nlegislation. This angered the Far Left, but the Radical Socialists were\nnow on their guard as well. The next stage of Briand\u2019s presentation left\nthem cold. Total silence fell on their benches as Briand insisted that a\ngovernment\u2019s first duty was to establish liberty and justice for all citi-\nzens, regardless of the political passions of the hour.This was read, cor-\nrectly, as a call for \u2018\u2018appeasement\u2019\u2019\u2014which the Radicals understood as\nreligious appeasement, not merely appeasement of the social unrest\nthat had spread under Clemenceau.\nAs Briand outlined his plan for electoral reform, he touched on the\ndefense of universal suffrage, a rallying cry for all Radicals. But many\nhad notheard the rumors about thesix-yearmandate proposal:\u2018\u2018mouve-\n82 Speech reported in Le matin, among other newspapers, June 10, 1910.The citations from\nthe declaration and the reactions of other deputies that follow are from this source.\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 57\nments divers\u2019\u2019 were noted throughout the Chamber. When Briand\nturned to administrative reform, making it the corollary of electoral\nreform, thesemovements developed. Given the background to this dec-\nlaration, it may be surprising that many deputies continued to associate\nregional decentralization with reaction. Nevertheless they did, and in\nspite of the most \u2018\u2018modern\u2019\u2019 spin Briand could muster (\u2018\u2018It is possible to\nsuperimpose a regional organization over departmental organization,\nby grouping departments on the basis of affinity of interests, notably\nin the economic domain\u2019\u2019), the official reports recorded one legisla-\ntor\u2019s remark, \u2018\u2018My word, he is becoming royaliste!,\u2019\u2019 as a testimony to the\nreaction of many in the Chamber. Briand\u2019s elucidation of the need to\nimprove the administration, develop the country\u2019s infrastructure, and\nintroduce a legal statute for civil servants again met with silence among\ntheRadical Socialists. A lengthy exposition of his ideas for social reform\nrevived some of their interest. He called for the extension of greater\nrights to unions, the establishment of workers\u2019 credit, the setting up of a\nsystemwhereby workers could benefitmore from the profits of industry,\nand, in rural areas, the introduction of a right to property for peasants.\nHe spoke of economic emancipation as naturally following the political\nfreedom the republic had achieved at its outset.\nThe reaction to Briand\u2019s speech showed that he had taken a dan-\ngerous tack. As a speech to be read in the newspapers, by the public\nat large, his presentation could not have been faulted. He had brought\npeace after the battles of the past and established a range of new proj-\nects for the social republic of the future. In the Chamber, however,\nreaction varied widely. Pelletan, perhaps predictably, proclaimed, \u2018\u2018Not\nfor years has any government given such a boost to the Right!\u2019\u2019 Jau-\nr\u00e8s understood it a little better, but even he foresaw danger for Briand.\n\u2018\u2018Never,\u2019\u2019 he insisted, \u2018\u2018for all that I am a proportionnaliste, would I have\ndared criticize the regime and its habits in this way.\u2019\u2019 The newspapers\ncited many Radicals and Radical Socialists who approved of the decla-\nration. Le radical hinted that the problems were issues of minor detail,\nnot of doctrine: Briand was overly keen onmilitary expenditure; he had\nnot sufficiently developed the defense of the secular education system;\nand he had not addressed the question of state monopolies.83\nThe Radical Socialist deputy Louis Malvy expressed the problem\nwith the declaration most clearly.84 It was a question not of what had\ngone into the speech but of the tone Briand had adopted and the order\n83 Le radical, June 10, 1910.\n84 Ibid. Malvy, a minister during the First World War, was implicated in the scandal involv-\ning Caillaux\u2019s private attempts to bring about peace.\n58 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\nin which he had made his points. Malvy had wanted to see income tax\nreform and the defense of secular education at the top of the agenda.\nBy beginning with state reform, moving on to social reform, and only\ntouching on issues of republican defense, Briand had given the Cham-\nber the impression that he was courting the Center and the Right.Thus\nthe tidal wave of interpellations that prolonged the debate until the end\nof June had a purpose beyond the oratorical vanity of parliamentarians.\nIt was important to the Radicals that Briand\u2019s rhetorical emphasis be\naltered, and thus they constantly sought \u2018\u2018clarification\u2019\u2019 by asking where\non the axis of political allegiance the government proposed to find its\ncenter of gravity.\nIf the split between Jacobins such as Pelletan and state reform-\ners such as Briand was the most obvious, another division was even\nmore important in the long run.The problem of the income tax lurked\nbehind the scenes in Radical Socialist quarters.The brilliant but flawed\nCaillaux, who had become an alternative figurehead for Radical Social-\nism, had made the campaign for a modern income tax his own, and\nthere was already a frisson of tension between Christ and Napol\u00e9on,\nas Clemenceau had described Briand and Caillaux.85 Indeed, it can be\nargued that Briand had ignored the income tax merely to snub Cail-\nlaux.86 When the Briand experiment ended in early 1911, it was Cail-\nlaux who emerged as the alternative leader of the Left (although the\nwillfulness of his foreign negotiations eventually compromised him).\nThis helps explain the muted reaction from the political group\nclosest in theory to Briand, the independent socialists, and behind\nthem intellectuals such as Parsons and Antonelli. As they met to dis-\ncuss their own response to the declaration, they expressed consider-\nable reservation about the whole program. Paul-Boncour argued that\nthe government could have built a far stronger majority on the left if it\nhad elaborated more on social-economic reforms.87 State monopolies\nshould have been developed; they were a feature of the Radical Party\nprogram and could have provided a new point of union between Radi-\ncals and Socialists. This gives a clear hint that some of the reform con-\nstituency believed it unnecessary to seek a wider coalition, and that the\nforward-looking reform agenda would best be served by concentrating\nmore heavily on social reform. Paul-Boncour never worked for Briand,\n85 Quoted in Rudolph Binion, Defeated Leaders: The Political Fate of Caillaux, Jouvenel, and Tar-\ndieu (New York, 1960), 29.\n86 Ibid., 31.\n87 Le radical, June 17, 1910.\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 59\nbut the following spring he entered the cabinet of Ernest Monis, which\nwas largely animated by Caillaux.\nLe radical \u2019s editorial the day after the debate had begun answered\nsome of the criticisms. The editorialist seemed to understand that Bri-\nand was using the Chamber to address the country as a whole.88 This\nof course was both the strength and the weakness of the declaration.\nBut this important organ of the center-left press believed that Briand\u2019s\nremark about the secular education system proved his trustworthiness.\nHe had offered measures that were not just republican but social demo-\ncratic, and thus in tune with the needs of the nation.89 La lanterne reiter-\nated this interpretation, insisting that Briand was not talking to the\nRight but rather was inviting the Left to work with him and move on\nfrom past battles.90\nEventually, Briand gave the Chamber the assurances it had de-\nmanded. The government wanted to follow a program that would rise\nabove party politics, he said, but it would resign if its majority ever\ndepended on the Right. The speech with which Briand closed the de-\nbate won over many republican groups in the Chamber, the press, and\nthe country as a whole\u2014not to mention foreign newspapers that, par-\nticularly on the other side of the Channel, had good reason to observe\nthe progress of reform in France.91 The general impression was that\nBriand could count on a majority made up of Radicals and Radical\nSocialists, without having to rely on the Center-Right. He appealed\nonce more to the Chamber\u2019s sense of national duty, promising that the\ngovernment would govern with a republican majority, but for the coun-\ntry as a whole.92\nMany of Briand\u2019s doubters had in fact been members of the re-\nform constituency who were suspicious of his beautiful speeches, which\nseemed to capture so easily the mood of the hour; but it was not Briand\nwho had frustrated their call for \u2018\u2018action, not words\u2019\u2019 so much as the\nendless interpellations from deputies seeking, in lengthy flights of ora-\ntory, clarification on subtle points of interpretation.93 At the beginning\nof July, in the last days before the summer recess, the government tried\nto galvanize the enthusiasm of the reform constituency once more, with\n88 Le radical, June 11, 1910.\n89 Paul Bour\u00e9ly, in Le radical, June 11, 1910.\n90 La lanterne, editorial, June 11, 1910.\n91 See the citations in Suarez, Briand, 2:269.\n92 See, e.g., reports in L\u2019action, July 28, 1910.\n93 Henry B\u00e9renger complained forcefully of the lengthiness of the debate in L\u2019action, July 20,\n1910.\n60 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\nthe deposition of three major laws: the project on electoral reform, as\npromised in the declaration; the long-awaited civil servants bill; and a\nreform of the judiciary that was announced by Briand\u2019s justice minis-\nter, the moderate Louis Barthou.94 Administrative reform would have\nto wait until the autumn. A circular to prefects asking for their views on\nregional reform was sent out in September; what came of it amid the\nchaos that followed in October is impossible to trace in detail.95 It is\nby no means clear that any concrete proposal on administrative reform\nwould have passed in the Chamber, even if the three major reforms put\nforth in July had been accomplished.\nThe mood in July 1910 was, however, tremendously favorable to\nBriand. He was applauded across Europe as a true statesman. Enco-\nmiums came from unlikely quarters. Joseph Reinach thought Briand\u2019s\nsumming-up speech the best thing he had heard since Gambetta. He\npointed out to Briand that much of the old opportunist approach was\ngermane to Briand\u2019s own desire to institute slow, peaceful change.96 The\nconnection between a politician now on the center-right, Reinach, and\na socially reformist government illustrates how broadly the concern for\nrepublican rejuvenation resonated with politicians of all parties, and\nit demonstrates once more the inadequacy of the bipolar model as a\ndefining concept in the politics of the Third Republic.\nThe most important of the compliments paid to Briand was, how-\never, a letter from Millerand, holidaying in Carlsbad at the end of July.\nMillerand, himself a strong personality, had infuriated his fellow Social-\nists by entering the government of Waldeck-Rousseau. As Socialist turn-\ncoats, he and Briand, who had been colleagues at La lanterne in the\nmid-1890s, shared a common position in politics: despite the strength\nof their personalities, they lacked a real power base in the Chamber.\nIn view of later developments, the following letter from Millerand to\nBriand is striking:\nMy dear friend,\nIt is now a year since you formed the ministry, and I did not\nwant to let this anniversary pass without sending you, from abroad,\nmy affectionate remembrances and my friendly gratitude for having\nassociated me with the major project you have established and pur-\nsued with so much talent, courage, and success.\nDifficulties you have not lacked, and they will continue. But\n94 See L\u2019action, July 1, 1910.\n95 See Bourjol, Institutions r\u00e9gionales, 152.\n96 Briand papers, vol. 27: several letters from Reinach, undated but clearly from the period\nOct. 1909\u2013Oct. 1910, offer encouragement and praise for recent speeches. The connection was\nfurther developed by Georges B\u00e9ret in De Gambetta \u00e0 Briand.\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 61\nyour very persistence in the post is a precious boost to your attempts\nto overcome them. Even here I have heard fellow countrymen who\nare far from sharing our ideas enthusiastically praising you, and\nyou can imagine with what pleasure and pride I have received their\nplaudits.\nYou have renewed the politics of our country, which the regime\nbadly needed.Your task is only just beginning as you attempt to real-\nize all the hopes to which that renewal has given rise; you have only,\nif you will allow me to reiterate what I have sometimes told you in\nperson, to have confidence in yourself.Your strength is greater than\nyou imagine: take heart from that.\nFor myself, I am proud to have been able, thanks to you, to col-\nlaborate in such a noble and necessary enterprise.97\nThe events of the autumn of 1910 have obscured the fundamental sym-\npathy between Millerand and Briand, founded on the hope that the\nlatter had instilled in the country. The notion that Briand\u2019s own per-\nsonality was holding him back seems strange, but perhaps he did have\nless confidence in himself than his presentation at the tribune of the\nChamber suggested. When we consider that never again, in any of his\nnumerous governments, did Briand announce such a broad package of\ndomestic reforms, with such a powerful political statement of the art of\ngoverning and the duty of a legislature and a cabinet to the country at\nlarge, we see that theremay indeed be something vital to be drawn from\nMillerand\u2019s letter. Briand\u2019s own character is an important consideration\nas we turn to the end of his appeasement experiment.\nThe failure of Briand\u2019s program stems largely from the events of Octo-\nber 1910, when a railway strike broke out and Briand was forced to\nadopt strong tactics to restore order. Unlike the debate from the May\nelections to the summer recess, these events have been well covered by\nbiographers and historians and must be passed over more rapidly here.\nWe need to begin, however, by revisiting the political debate within the\nRadical Party, which had not been fully pacified by the end of June 1910\nand which provided a context for the autumn crisis.\nDuring the parliamentary recess, B\u00e9renger renewed the propa-\nganda campaign for Briand\u2019s program in a long series of articles in\nwhich he attacked the Jacobin wing of the Radical Party.98 Although\nmost Radicals in the Chamber had been won over, Emile Combes, the\nformer prime minister who was now using his position in the Senate to\ncriticize government vacillation over the issue of republican defense,\n97 Briand papers, vol. 26, dated July 25, 1910.\n98 Articles in L\u2019action, Aug. 6\u201325, 1910.\n62 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\nhad not been party to those discussions. He rightly saw that Briand\u2019s\nreform movement was grounded in a rejection of the narrowly anti-\nclerical policy he had himself pursued when head of the government\nbetween 1902 and 1905. He issued a denunciation of Briand, timed just\nafter Parliament had been dismissed for the summer. B\u00e9renger took up\nthe argument for the reformers. Combes, he insisted, had never even\nhad a program of social reform and was therefore in no position to\naccuse Briand of using his as a shield for right-wingers. There was a\nproblem, B\u00e9renger was forced to admit:apaisement, the term that Briand\nhad used from early 1909 to distinguish his social and state reforms,\nwas still causing confusion. Combes could use it to suggest that Briand\nwas more concerned with appeasing the clerical Right, yet that had\nnever been Briand\u2019s understanding, nor was it supported by B\u00e9renger,\nLa d\u00e9mocratie sociale, or the Radicals and Socialists closest to Briand.99\nB\u00e9renger admitted that the government had been applauded by some\non the right, but he blamed Radicals such as Combes. If they had come\non board unequivocally, the problem would never have arisen and the\ngovernment could have established its program more efficiently.100\nAs it was, the summer recess was looking increasingly dangerous\nfor the government and its plans. The railway workers had been threat-\nening to strike since the spring, and although Millerand had steered\nother workers away from suchmeasures, he could not prevent the chemi-\nnots from walking off the job at the end of September. The outbreak\ncame hard on the heels of the death of Briand\u2019s mother, for whom the\nprime minister was still in mourning. Although he gave no sign of it in\npolitical debate, Briand was shattered, and his concentration on politi-\ncal issues must have suffered. He decided to break the strike by con-\nscripting the railway workers into the army, thus obliging them to keep\nworking. Although a wide body of opinion praised him for his coura-\ngeous action, his own cabinet was split.The two most senior left-wingers\nin the government were Ren\u00e9 Viviani, who had strong links to working-\nclass movements, having been the first minister of labor under Clemen-\nceau, and Millerand. The latter was extremely anxious about the con-\nsequences of Briand\u2019s action, while the former was simply furious.101\nThe Chamber reconvened in an atmosphere of great tension, with\nthe government already on shaky ground. As he sought to reassert his\nauthority, Briand gave a remarkable speech in which he declared ille-\n99 L\u2019action, Aug. 13, 1910.\n100 L\u2019action, Aug. 12, 1910.\n101 Suarez, Briand, 2:278\u201379; on Barthou\u2019s reaction, see R. J.Young, Power and Pleasure: Louis\nBarthou and the Third French Republic (Montreal, 1991), 94.\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 63\ngality an option, albeit a last resort, for a government determined to\nprotect the national interest.This statement divided opinion evenmore\nsharply. The slippage between the speech\u2019s reception in the Cham-\nber and in the newspapers the next morning was even greater than\nbefore.102 As he had done in June, Briand seduced the intellectuals and\nthe reporters, but in the end it was the fire and brimstone called down\nby Socialist and Radical Socialist deputies that doomed the govern-\nment. Without the support of Viviani and Millerand, the whole point\nof Briand\u2019s apaisement was lost; it had always depended on a coalition of\nmoderates and independent socialists, with backing from the intellec-\ntual Radical Socialists we have examined here.The atmosphere of hope\nand trust that Briand had instilled in the Chamber, and that had been\nstrong enough to survive the debate of June 1910, had been shattered\nby the end of October.\nBriand\u2019s personal reaction to this turn of events is difficult to\nfathom. His remark about illegality was politically reckless: no amount\nof spin in center-left newspapers would help him strengthen his ma-\njority for the reform agenda.Why, having seenViviani\u2019s earlier reaction\nto his strikebreaking tactics, did Briand not attempt to beguile the Left\nand calm the atmosphere in the Chamber? He evidently did not think\nthe reaction of the Far Left worth the trouble. One of Briand\u2019s biog-\nraphers pointed to a classic incident: a hard-line Socialist was heap-\ning invective on him, and Briand could be seen uncharacteristically\nmaking copious notes\u2014it was widely assumed that he was outlining\nthe brilliant retort he duly delivered. In fact, Briand was writing to his\nlover Berthe Cerny, begging forgiveness for his distraction in the cur-\nrent political climate.103 His blithe attitude, admirable to some, was ulti-\nmately a weakness. If he had genuinely believed in the great program\nhe announced in June, his approach to building the political consen-\nsus necessary to see it through was lackadaisical. When he resigned to\nform a new cabinet, Briand seemed to have forgotten the whole apaise-\nment campaign. His second cabinet was dominated by men for whom\nrepublican defense was the first imperative: compared to the agenda of\nJune 1910, the new government\u2019s program was very narrow. The prin-\nciple of arbitration in labor disputes remained central (of necessity),\nbut Briand\u2019s campaign for wide-reaching state reforms was over.\nThe two themes of the reform constituency were once more di-\n102 See letters from Henry Bernstein, Oct. 21, 1910 (Briand papers, vol. 21), and Ferdi-\nnand, King of Bulgaria, who visited the Chamber during this debate, Nov. 1, 1910 (Briand papers,\nvol. 25). On Bernstein and Briand, see Suarez, Briand, 2:280\u201381.\n103 Saint-Georges de Bouh\u00e9lier, Un grand amour de Briand (Geneva, 1949), 308.\n64 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\nvided. The hope for state reform now lay with the moderate Poincar\u00e9,\nwho would emerge as a leading force in 1912; at the same time, social\nreform was pushed forward by Caillaux. This new political arrange-\nment allowed the mass of republicans to make a clearer choice. Poin-\ncar\u00e9 drew support from some on the left, such as Briand himself, while\nothers found the clearly Radical Socialist agenda of Caillaux much\nmore uncompromising than that of Briand. The new alignment in fact\npredates the argument over the three-year military conscription law,\nwhich many have seen as the principal dividing line in the prewar\nChamber.The political disputes of 1913\u201314 were prepared by the fallout\nfrom Briand\u2019s apaisement experiment.\nThat the reform constituency had divided into two camps, one\nmaintaining pressure for electoral or administrative reform, the other\nfocusing on social issues, was made clear by the problems experienced\nby the groups of young intellectuals that had coalesced around Briand\nin 1909\u201310. The Comit\u00e9 de la D\u00e9mocratie Sociale was confronted with\na grave choice: either refuse any cooperation with social Catholicism,\nor continue on the path of appeasement by building bridges across the\nold divide between clerical Right and anticlerical Left.104 The Catho-\nlic republican movement muddied the waters. Marc Sangnier, founder\nof the social Catholic organization Le Sillon, had thrown down the\ngauntlet to left-wing intellectuals, demanding the foundation of a new\nparty that would unite all who sought the rejuvenation of the republic.\nBecause of the interventions of Radicals such as Combes and Pelletan,\nthis challenge was issued too late. Antonelli and Parsons were uncertain\nhow to proceed and found the decision taken out of their hands by the\nintransigent anticlericalism of the \u2018\u2018Jeunes radicaux,\u2019\u2019 led by Paul Hya-\ncinthe Loyson.105 The young reformers convened a congress with the\naim of harmonizing their antistatist programs. Regional decentraliza-\ntion was a central part of the agenda, with La d\u00e9mocratie sociale, Le Sillon,\nand a group known as the \u2018\u2018Jeunesse r\u00e9publicaine patriote\u2019\u2019 all subscrib-\ning to the basic principles of regionalism. Yet even here it was obvious\nthat union in the republican youth movements was impossible.106 The\nreform constituency was impossibly divided.\nOlder Radicals, notably Combes and Clemenceau, continued to\nprevent progress, hampering Poincar\u00e9\u2019s state reform projects in the\nSenate. Thus France\u2019s reform constituency was divided at its base and\n104 G\u00e9rard Baal, \u2018\u2018Les jeunes radicaux (1910\u20131914),\u2019\u2019 in Hommage \u00e0 Madeleine Reb\u00e9rioux:\nAvenirs et avant-gardes en France, XIXe\u2013XXe si\u00e8cle, ed.

Intellectuals would continue to criticize the unre-\nformed state, as Robert de Jouvenel\u2019s La r\u00e9publique des camarades showed.\nThe FRF and other pressure groups continued their propaganda, and\nmuch cross-fertilization went on between the different movements for\nstate reform. For example, Antonelli, who was Charles-Brun\u2019s princi-\npal interlocutor at a special session of the eminent Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Economie\nSociale, asked the regionalist leader whether he could see regional-\nism as part of a wider program of social and state reforms.107 In the\nlonger term, state reform remained essential to many who wanted to\nrejuvenate the republic, whether they were building programs of post-\nwar reconstruction or attempting to revive republican institutions in the\ncrisis of the mid-1930s. But the Jacobins of the Radical Party stymied\nprogress at the one time, in 1910, when pressures were less and when\nsuccess might have been possible.\nAlthough some social reformers had implicitly rejected Briand\nas a progenitor of reform, many aspects of his style remained. Paul-\nBoncour, for example, declared that he had but one aim as minister\nof labor: to apply the pensions law by July 3, 1911.108 The concern with\nmaking politics more practical was essential. As with Briand\u2019s attack\non the \u2018\u2018mares stagnantes,\u2019\u2019 what was at issue was the nature of Par-\nliament. Rejuvenation of the republic would only come if politicians\nconcentrated on thorny issues of economic and social reality. This con-\ncentration on a \u2018\u2018politique r\u00e9aliste,\u2019\u2019 and the establishment of a social\nreform agenda within republicanism, had emerged in Briand\u2019s moment\nof hope and would be perhaps its most important legacy.\nThus the strange moment of hope that presented itself to France\nin 1910 is central to the history of the Third Republic. In the current\natmosphere of French historical and political studies, realism and the\nreaction against a priori principles are all too easily associated with the\n\u2018\u2018New Right.\u2019\u2019 This is because Maurras and others sometimes used terms\nsuch as realism and organicism to underscore their own political projects.\nDiscovering such terms in the manifestos of independent socialists can\nthus be surprising. The issue of Briand\u2019s personality is important as\nwell. Put off perhaps by the epithets applied to Briand later in life\u2014\nBriand the lazy man, too idle to develop a sustained program that fol-\nlowed socialist principles\u2014scholars of early-twentieth-century politics\nhave all too often ignored the presence behind Briand of a coherent\nbody of intellectual opinion. Marie-Georges D\u00e8zes put her finger pre-\ncisely on the nature of this opinion in her contribution to a special\n107 The meeting was held on Jan. 8, 1912, and reported in the R\u00e9forme sociale of Mar. 1912.\n108 Henri de Jouvenel, preface to Le Blond, Id\u00e9es de Paul-Boncour, 9.\n66 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES\nissue of the journal Mouvement social on reformism. Briand\u2019s project was\nplaced \u2018\u2018under the patronage of those who . . . refused the millenni-\nalist irrationalism of ideology, and described a government of opin-\nion as that which reestablished social balance through a progressive\nprogram of daily action.\u2019\u2019109 Above all, then the \u2018\u2018politique r\u00e9aliste\u2019\u2019 of\nBriand implied reforming slowly, day by day, in consultation with public\nopinion. Intellectual groups such as Benoist\u2019s proportional representa-\ntion activists or Charles-Brun\u2019s regionalist movement thus had a double\nrole to play. By building grassroots support through propaganda, they\nwould create the conditions for reform to be politically realizable; by\ncontinuing to promote state reform in more intellectual circles, they\npersuaded opinion makers that state reform was a tangible problem,\ninvolving real social issues. The haste demanded by B\u00e9renger in the\nsummer of 1910 was not the best way to proceed: a longer campaign\nwas needed, involving the education of public opinion as well as the\nadoption of reform packages.\nIn the short term, this meant that reform was often frustrated.\nThe essential point, however, is that writers such as Antonelli and Paul-\nBoncour struggled to make politics dependent on normative political\nproblems rather than on a priori questions. Perhaps they were ahead\nof their time. Briand embodied the philosophy of steady change to the\nextent that, when compared with the vocal dogmatists of the Radical\nand Socialist parties, he appeared to be a vacillator, an \u2018\u2018endormeur.\u2019\u2019\nYet the \u2018\u2018normatization\u2019\u2019 of politics had a clear intellectual coherence,\nand the ongoing struggles of politicians such as Briand, Viviani, and\nPoincar\u00e9 to respond to the proposals thrown up by the intellectual\nreform constituency show that the Third Republic was not a dead-end\nr\u00e9gime but one where arguments over principle were slowly and uncer-\ntainly giving way to arguments over \u2018\u2018progr\u00e8s quotidien,\u2019\u2019 the politics of\ndaily reform.\nAt the heart of political debate was an increasing focus on real-\nism and pragmatism. From the crisis of the 1930s until the later years\nof the twentieth century, pragmatism was a dirty word, associated with\ncollaboration and an erosion of those principles on which liberation\ndepended. Yet when a Lionel Jospin proposes, within the constitution,\na special status for Corsica, or a Jean-Pierre Raffarin institutes the\nidea of \u2018\u2018experimental lawmaking,\u2019\u2019 allowing state reform to be intro-\nduced at speeds that vary according to the needs of different regions,\nit is clear that realism is once more defining French political debate,\ncutting across the old party lines and perhaps fulfilling some of the\n109 D\u00e8zes, \u2018\u2018Participation et d\u00e9mocratie sociale,\u2019\u2019 117.\nBRIAND\u2019S MOMENT OF HOPE 67\nhopes raised by the state reformers and social reformers of the belle\n\u00e9poque.Understanding the reform debate of 1900\u20131910 is clearly rele-\nvant to current ideas about decentralization and constitutional change.\nBriand\u2019s moment of hope may in the short run have been a false dawn,\nbut in looking at the intellectual and political context of that moment,\nwe have seen that the realist approach to politics was central to main-\nstream republican thinking. That is why the more pragmatic but less\ndoctrinaire programs of reform continue to bring a note of optimism\ninto French politics.Whether Raffarin\u2019s realism can successfully answer\nthe great questions that arose out of the presidential elections of April\n2002 remains to be seen, especially after the Right\u2019s humiliation in the\nregional elections of April 2004. Nevertheless, this article has suggested\nthat the historical references for such an understanding are fruitful and\nabundant.\n"}
