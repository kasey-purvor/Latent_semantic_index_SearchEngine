INTRODUCTION\nEthylene is the one of most important building blocks used in the petrochemical industry. Thermal\ncracking of hydrocarbons is the main route for the manufacturing of ethylene and propylene [1].\nAlthough ethane, propane, butane, naphtha and gas oil can be used as feedstocks for cracking reactions,\nnaphtha is the most frequently used raw material [2]. Therefore, naphtha cracking is the focus of this\nstudy.\n1.1 Thermal cracking furnace\nThe thermal cracking furnace is the heart of the whole ethylene manufacturing process. A typical unit\ngenerally includes the convection section, the cross-over section and the radiation section [1,2]. Naphtha\nis preheated in the convection section and then mixed with steam. The mixture of naphtha and steam is\nintroduced into the tubular reactors or cracking coils in the radiation section at a high temperature. The\ncracking reactions take place inside these long tubular reactors. Firebox and burners were designed to\napply a high heat flux to the outer reactor tube surface so that the process gases reach their reaction\ntemperature rapidly. Steam is a diluent and it is used to improve olefin selectivity and reduce coking\nrate.\n1.2 Literature review\nThis section is a summary of the current developments in the reaction schemes for naphtha cracking,\nmodelling, simulation and optimisation study of tubular reactors.\n2The naphtha cracking process involves many free-radical reactions. Towfighi and Karimzadeh\npublished a free-radical reaction scheme for naphtha cracking which includes 150 reactions [3]. Due to\ncomputation difficulties, models based on molecular reactions have been widely used [2]. Wang et al.\ndeveloped a molecular reaction mechanism for steam cracking of naphtha [4, 5]. Kumar and Kunzru\nproposed another molecular reaction mechanism for naphtha steam cracking based on their laboratory\nexperimentation [6]. In the meantime, Kumar and Kunzru developed a kinetics model for predicting\ncoking rate [7].\nShahrokhi and Nejati carried out an optimal operation study based on 1-dimensional (1D) plug flow\nsteady-state model for propane thermal cracking [8]. Operating profit was used as objective function and\nthe optimal temperature profile was obtained. In formulating the above objective function, the time\nrequired for decoking was considered and the cost for decoking operations were expressed as a fraction\nof the production revenue. Masoumi et al. developed a 1D steady-state model for tubular reactors in\nnaphtha cracking [9]. A free-radical reaction scheme including 90 species and 543 reactions was used.\nAn optimisation study was performed with the aim to maximize operating profit. In the study, the\noptimal coil outlet temperature was found to be 1150.49K. At this condition, the ethylene yield was\n33.74% and the coking rate was around 0.008 g\/cm2 min.\nIn a thermal cracking furnace, complex transfers (such as mass, momentum and heat transfers), thermal\ncracking reactions and fuel combustion take place. These are closely coupled and interacted with each\nother. Previous studies focused on the simulation of thermal cracking reactions and radiative heat\ntransfer while the flows of process gas and flue gas were simplified [2]. The plug-flow assumption of\nprocess gas and flue gas results in significant differences in simulation results compared to simulations\nwith a realistic flow field [10]. The difference between the temperature at the tube centre and the\ntemperature at the tube wall has a significant effect on the reaction in a thermal cracking furnace. Thus,\n3-dimensional (3D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used in [10, 11].\n1.3 The motivation and aim of this study\nBy comparison, the 1D steady-state models (especially with commercial tools such as HYSYS and\nAspen Plus) are easy and fast to develop. The 1D simulation could provide reasonably accurate results.\nOn the contrary, 3D CFD models would require many technical details for configuration. It also requires\nlots of computation. Generally, the results from 3D CFD simulation could be more accurate. Therefore,\nthere is a tradeoff between efforts, computation and accuracy of simulation results.\nThis paper concentrates on tubular reactors and the cracking reactions inside them. So far, no\npublications can be found in the literature to quantitatively evaluate the impact of process gas\ntemperature profile and steam to hydrocarbon ratio in the feed on the ethylene\/propylene product yields\nand coking rate based on a real industrial thermal cracking furnace.\nThe study is based on steady-state simulation and optimisation using HYSYS [12]. Tubular reactors of a\nreal industrial thermal cracking furnace presented in [10] were simulated with the molecular reaction\nscheme proposed in [6]. The reaction scheme published in [4, 5] was originally used by Lan et al. [10]. It\nwas not used in this study since insufficient detail was given. The impact of process gas temperature\nprofile and inlet steam to hydrocarbon ratio on the ethylene\/propylene product yields and coking rate\n3were evaluated by varying the operating conditions of the tubular reactors. In the study for optimal\noperation, operation profit was used as objective function. The process gas temperature profile and inlet\nsteam to hydrocarbon ratio were used as optimisation variables. The effect of coking on reduction of\nmanufacturing time and the decoking cost have been considered.\nThe present work is different from those published in the literature in three main respects: (a) all the case\nstudies were performed based on the same real industrial naphtha cracking furnace; (b) The tubular\nreactor operation optimisation has been studied systematically; (c) the simulation and optimisation tool\nHYSYS is commercially available and easy to use. These features should make this study very\nappropriate to practising process engineers in the ethylene industry.\nThe paper is laid out as follows. Details of the base case simulation will be described in Section 2.\nVarious case studies will be conducted in Section 3. Section 4 is to study the optimal operation.\nConclusions will be drawn in the end.\n2. SIMULATION of A BASE CASE\n2.1 Tubular reactors and operating conditions\nThe simulation is based on long tubular reactors of a real industrial thermal cracking furnace described\nin [10]. The whole furnace has 40 identical reaction tubes. Each tubular reactor is constructed by 2\npasses of different diameters. The reactor feed contains naphtha and dilution steam. The feed has a mass\nflowrate 11,500kg\/h for naphtha and a mass flowrate of 6,900 kg\/h for steam. In this way, the mixture of\nnaphtha and steam has a mole flow rate of 509 kmol\/h and steam to naphtha ratio in the feed is 0.6 to 1.\nFeed temperature is 853 K and pressure is 206 kPa. Outlet temperature is controlled at 1,068 K and\npressure at 172 kPa.\n2.2 Reaction scheme\nThe molecular reaction scheme proposed by Kumar and Kunzru [6] was adopted since it has been\nwidely cited. This reaction scheme contains 1 primary reaction (first order) and 21 secondary reactions\n(first order). Due to different naphtha as feedstock, the stoichiometric coefficients for primary reaction\nwere adjusted according to the naphtha properties used in [10]. Among the 21 secondary reactions,\nnumbers 2, 3, 7 and 16 are reversible reactions. But the kinetics data for these 4 reverse reactions were\nnot given in [6]. Therefore, the reaction equilibrium constants for these 4 reverse reactions were\nextracted from [13]. Reverse reaction kinetic parameters were then calculated with kR = kF \/ kC, where kR\ndenotes reverse reaction rate constant, kF the forward react rate constant and kC the reaction equilibrium\nconstant. The final reaction mechanism used is listed in Table 1 and Table 2.\nTable 1 Reaction scheme for naphtha cracking used in this study\nNo. Reaction equations K0, s-1 E, cal\/mol\n1 C6.5H14 => 0.50H2 + 0.76CH4 + 1.16C2H4 + 0.13C2H6 + 0.38C3H6\n+ 0.09C3H8 + 0.008C4H10 + 0.245C4H8 + 0.113C4H6 + 0.08C4\u2019s\n6.565E+11 52,580\n2 C2H6 <=> C2H4 + H2 4.652E+13 65,210\n3 C3H6 <=> C2H2 + CH4 7.284E+12 65,330\n4 C2H2 + C2H4 => C4H6 (1.026E+15)b 41,260\n45 2C2H6 => C3H8 + CH4 3.75E+12 65,250\n6 C2H4 + C2H6 => C3H6 + CH4 (7.083E+16)b 60,430\n7 C3H8 <=> C3H6 + H2 5.888E+10 51,290\n8 C3H8 => C2H4 + CH4 4.692E+10 50,600\n9 C3H8 + C2H4 => C2H6 + C3H6 (2.536E+16)b 59,060\n10 2C3H6 => 3C2H4 7.386E+12 64,170\n11 2C3H6 => 0.3CnH2n-6 + 0.14C6++ 3CH4 2.424E+11 56,900\n12 C3H6 + C2H6 => C4H8 + CH4 (1.000E+17)b 60,010\n13 C4H10 => C3H6 + CH4 7.000E+12 59,640\n14 C4H10 => 2C2H4 + H2 7.000E+14 70,680\n15 C4H10 => C2H4 + C2H6 4.099E+12 61,310\n16 C4H10 <=> C4H8 + H2 1.637E+12 62,360\n17 C4H8 => 0.41 CnH2n-6 + 0.19C6+ 2.075E+11 50,730\n18 C4H8 => H2 + C4H6 1.000E+10 50,000\n19 C2H4 + C4H6 => B + 2H2 (8.385E+12)b 34,560\n20 C4H6 + C3H6 => T + 2H2 (9.740E+11)b 35,640\n21 C4H6 + C4H8 => EB + 2H2 (6.400E+17)b 57,970\n22 C4H6 + C4H6 => ST + 2H2 (1.510E+12)b 29,760\nB: benzene; T: toluene; EB: ethylbenzene; ST: styrene. b Units:cm3\/(mol s).\nTable 2 Reverse react rate constants for Kumar model (E, kcal\/mol)\nNo. Reverse reaction rate constant(l mol-1 s-1)\nReaction 2\n)63.32exp(1049.8 8\nRT\nk R \uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d\nReaction 3\n)17.35exp(1081.3 8\nRT\nk R \uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d\nReaction 7 )34.22exp(1003.9 5\nRT\nk R \uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d\nReaction 16\n)3.32exp(1078.1 7\nRT\nk R \uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d\n2.3 Base case simulation and results\nA 1D plug flow reactor (PFR) model was chosen in HYSYS to simulate the tubular reactors. The\nmodified molecular reaction scheme was described above in section 2.2. The PFR sizes and operating\nconditions were described in section 2.1. Figure 1 shows the process gas temperature profile along the\nreactor tubes, which is the same as in [10]. This is the temperature profile used in real industry.\n5850\n900\n950\n1000\n1050\n1100\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nReactor Length(m)\nG\nas\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n(K\n)\nFigure 1 process gas temperature profile along the reactor tube\nIn Table 3, the main product yields from the base case simulation in HYSYS were compared with the\ncorresponding industrial data from [10]. As can be seen, simulation yields are in good agreement with\nindustrial values. This indicates that HYSYS simulation is a good reflection of the real process.\nTable 3 Simulation results compared with industrial data\nMain products yield (wt%) from HYSYS simulation Industrial yield (wt%)\nH2 0.86 0.72\nCH4 9.70 9.69\nC2H4 25.31 25.34\nC2H6 2.59 2.57\nC3H6 11.46 11.66\nC4H6 4.34 4.39\nFigure 2 shows the progress of the cracking reactions along the reactor tube. From Figures 1 and 2, it can\nbe seen that process gas temperature increases rapidly along the first pass, but product yields go up\nslowly. Whilst in the second pass, process gas temperature increases gradually, main product yields\nincrease sharply. This is because the naphtha cracking reactions are endothermic. The heat transferred\nthrough the tube wall is used to increase the process gas temperature and to provide the reaction heat.\nThe reaction rate is accelerated with the increase of temperature. In the first pass, process gas\ntemperature increases from 853 to 1050 K, the reaction rate is still relatively slow. In the second pass,\nprocess gas temperature increases from 1050 to 1068 K, the reaction rate becomes much faster. Clearly,\nmost of the reaction is performed in the second pass where the gas temperatures are higher. The\naromatics concentration which is a critical determinant for coke deposition [7] also increases in the\nsecond tube pass due to the secondary reactions occurring there.\n60 5 10 15 20 25\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\naromatics\nc4h6\nCH4\nC3H6\nC2H4\nPr\nod\nuc\nts\nyi\nel\nds\n(w\nt%\n)\nReactor length(m)\nFigure 2 Main cracking product yields along the reactor tube\n3. CASE STUDIES\n3.1 Effects of process gas temperature profile\nFrom the base case simulation in Section 2, the process gas temperature profile has an important effect\non the cracking product yields. To further investigate this effect quantitatively, the following different\ncases were studied. Under the same feed conditions (i. e. the same naphtha was used and the steam to\nnaphtha ratio is fixed at 0.6:1), only the process gas temperature profiles applied along the reactors were\nchanged, the rest of the operating conditions are the same as in the base case. The process gas\ntemperature profiles were produced in the following way: the initial temperature remained the same, the\ngrowth in temperature along the tube reactor were paralleled to the initial profile plus an increment\nproportional to the difference between the final outlet temperature and the distance along the tube\nreactor length. Different coil outlet temperatures (COT) were achieved (as shown in Figure 3). The first\npart of the temperature profile could not be steeper due to practical design limitations.\n70 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0\nR e a c t o r L e n g t h ( m )\nFigure 3 Different process gas temperature profiles along the reactor tube\nThe simulation results on yields were summarized in Figure 4. Although the ethylene yield improved\nthroughout the temperature range, there is a disappointing loss of propylene (an equally valuable\nproduct) beyond an exit temperature of 1,103.15 K. In addition, the aromatics increased continuously\nthroughout the temperature range. The aromatics is believed to be the main reason that causes coke\ndeposition [7].\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n1060 1080 1100 1120 1140 1160 1180\nCOT (K)\nY\nie\nld\n(w\nt%\n)\nC2H4 yield\nC3H6 yield\nAromatics yield\nFigure 4 Effect of COT on product yields\nCoking rate prediction proposed by Kumar and Kunzru [7] can be described as follows:\n97.115 *)\/260,212(*10*95.1 aromc CRTEXPR \uf02d\uf03d (1)\nwhere Rc denotes the coking rate in kg\/(m2 h) and Carom denotes the total aromatics concentration\n(kmol\/m3). From equation (1), the coking rate should increase with process gas temperature accordingly.\n8In the whole tubular reactor, the reactor outlet should have the highest temperature. Thus, it is important\nto check the coking behaviour at the tube outlet. Figure 5 shows the effect of the process gas temperature\non coking rate at the tube outlet. With the COT increases, the coking rate increases dramatically. At\nhigher coking rate, the coking will build up faster at the inner wall of the tube. The interval between\ndecoking will be shorter. Generally a reactor decoking operation requires the unit to be taken off-line for\n24 \u2013 48 hours, this interruption can have a significant negative impact on the overall production rate.\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n1060 1080 1100 1120 1140 1160 1180\nCOT(K)\nC\nok\nin\ng\nra\nte\n(k\ng\/\nm\n2\nh)\nFigure 5 Effect of COT on coking rate\n3.2 Effects of steam to naphtha ratio in the feed\nTo study the effects of steam to naphtha ratio in the feed on the product yields and the coking rate,\ndifferent cases were designed. Same as in the base case, the feed has a fixed mole flow rate 509kmol\/h\nfor naphtha and steam. Steam to naphtha ratio (kg\/kg) varies between 0.2:1 and 1.3:1. The temperature\nprofile applied along the tubular reactor is the same as in Figure 1. Figure 6 shows the trend of product\nyields changing with the steam to naphtha (kg\/kg) ratio in the feed. As can be seen, there is little\nincentive from a yield point of view to increase the steam fraction beyond about 0.8. However, it will be\nrecognised that with a constant molar flow of reactants the ethylene\/propylene production rates fall\nsignificantly at the higher steam dilutions. It is, therefore, imperative to operate at the lowest steam\ndilutions possible, provided that the resulting coking rate can be accepted.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\nSteam to naphtha ratio(kg\/kg)\nY\nie\nld\n(w\nt%\n)\nC2H4 yield\nC3H6 yield\nFigure 6 Effect of steam\/naphtha (kg\/kg) ratio in the feed on product yields\n9With the model proposed by Kumar and Kunzru [7] to calculate the coking rate, the influence of steam\ndilution on the coking rate is represented in Figure 7 which shows a reduction from 0.0087 to 0.0063\nkg\/(m2 h) as the steam ratio (kg\/kg) increases from 0.2:1 to 1.3:1. On this basis, the choice of the 0.6\nsteam ratio used in the base case simulation appears to be a reasonable compromise. This trend can be\nexplained theoretically. The increase of steam to naphtha ratio in the feed means the reduction of\nnaphtha partial pressure in the feed.\n0\n0.001\n0.002\n0.003\n0.004\n0.005\n0.006\n0.007\n0.008\n0.009\n0.01\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\nSteam to naphtha ratio(kg\/kg)\nC\nok\nin\ng\nra\nte\n(k\ng\/\nm\n2\nh)\nFigure 7 Effect of steam\/naphtha ratio (kg\/kg) on coking rate\n4. OPTIMAL OPERATION\nThe most profitable operating conditions will be a complex balance involving the product yield, steam\ndilution, temperature profile and the coking rate (which results in appreciable \u201cdowntime\u201d). The\nsimulation results presented in Section 3 above suggest that the most sensitive operating parameter is\nlikely to be the imposed reactant temperature profile followed by the steam to hydrocarbon ratio.\nThese variables are, therefore, the focus of the optimisation work.\n4.1 Mathematical formulation of the optimal operation problem\nThe following assumptions have been made for formulating this optimisation problem: (1) No\ndownstream product separation costs are counted; (2) The impact of change in coking buildup (thickness)\non heat transfer coefficient (through the pipe) is not considered.\nIn this study, the operating profit was used as the objective function. It was defined as the income from\ndesired products minus various costs. Costs include raw material cost (naphtha here), cost for steam,\ncost for radiant heat plus decoking cost. A fixed value (denoted by DCC) was used for decoking cost.\nThe operating profit was calculated on a yearly basis.\nCostIncomef p \uf02d\uf03d (2)\niiddp cFtntIncome \uf0e5\uf02d\uf03d *)( (3)\nDCCnQccFcFtntCost dQHHddp *)(*)( 00 \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d (4)\n10\nWhere fp represents the operating profit, Fi the desirable product flow rate, F0 the naphtha flow rate; FH\nthe steam flow rate; nd denotes the decoking times per year.

Mathematically it was described as following:\nDCCnQccFcFtntcFtnt dQHHddpiiddp *)(*)(*)(max 00 \uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf0e5 (7)\n4.2 Case study\nThe yearly production time (tp) is assumed to be 340 days and 24 hours per day.

Table 5\nsummarized other optimisation results and these were compared with the current operating conditions\ndescribed in [10]. From Table 5, it can be seen that after optimisation, the operating profit was improved\nobviously. Figure 9 gave the details of main cracking product yields along the reactor tube under the\noptimal operating conditions.\n0 2 4 6 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 2 2\n8 5 0\n9 0 0\n9 5 0\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 5 0\n1 1 0 0\nT u b e L e n g th ( m )\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n(K\n)\nO r i g i n a l t e m p e r a t u r e p r o f i l e\no p t i m a l t e m p e r a t u r e p r o f i l e\nFigure 8 Process gas temperature profile along the reactor tube (obtained from optimisation)\nTable 5 Optimisation results\nItems original value Optimal value\nCoil out temperature COT (K) 1068.05 1084.15\nSteam to naphtha (kg\/kg) ratio 0.6 0.6\nC2H4 yiled (wt%) 25.25 29.65\nC3H6 yiled (wt%) 11.44 12.83\nObjective function value ($\/year) -5.848*106 1.016*105\nRadiant heat flux (kJ\/h) 2.70*107 3.03*107\nProduction time between two\nconsecutive decokings (days)\n41.46 21\n12\n0 2 4 6 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 2 2\n0\n5\n1 0\n1 5\n2 0\n2 5\n3 0\nT u b e L e n g th ( m )\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n(K\n)\nO r i g i n a l C 2 H 4\nO r i g i n a l C 3 H 6\no p t i m a l C 2 H 4\no p t i m a l C 3 H 6\nFigure 9 Main cracking product yields along the reactor tube\nFrom Figure 8, the optimal process gas temperature is 1084.15K at the outlet of the tubular reactor.\nCompared with the base case, COT has been increased 16.1K. In this way, the cracking reaction is much\nfaster and the product yields are higher correspondingly (refer to Table 5 and Figure 9). This contributes\nhigher profits. On the other hand, due to increased temperature over the whole tube length (in the\noptimal temperature profile), the coking rate becomes higher. Therefore, the expense caused by tubular\nreactor shutdown for decoking also becomes higher. The optimal steam to naphtha ratio in the feed is\nstill 0.6 (refer to Table 5). So the production time between two consecutive decokings reduced from\n41.46 days to 21 days. The operation has been improved from making a loss of $5.848 million at the\nbase operating condition to making a profit $101.6 k at the optimal operating condition.\n5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, tubular reactors in the industrial thermal cracking furnace presented in [10] were simulated.\nWith the same industrial furnace, the impact of process gas temperature profile and inlet steam to\nhydrocarbon ratio on the ethylene\/propylene product yields and coking rate was studied through various\ncases. The optimal process temperature profile and the optimal inlet steam to naphtha ratio were found\nto maximize the operation profit. This study will provide significant guidance to practising process\nengineers in the ethylene industry.\nFuture work will be concentrated on (a) to model the coking at the inner wall of the tube varying with\ntime more accurately; (b) to take into account the impact of coking on product yields with time and (c) to\nconsider the coking affecting the production time between two consecutive decokings more accurately.\nTo implement these functions, a more powerful modelling, simulation and optimisation tool such as\ngPROMS and Aspen Custom Modeler may be required to replace HYSYS since gPROMS and Aspen\nCustom Modeler have the ability to develop process models according to different scenarios.\n13\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nGuangying Gao gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the National Scholarship Council, P.
