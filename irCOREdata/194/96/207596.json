Introduction\nThere is considerable consensus among economists and policy makers that there is fail-\nure in the market for loans, especially those for new businesses. Even more remarkably,\nthere is agreement about the direction of the failure: lending should be increased from\nthe laissez-faire level. This paper challenges this view, invoking ideas from The Wealth of\nNations. Adam Smith was convinced that entrepreneurs display the trait for which mod-\nern psychologists have coined the pleonasm \u2018unrealistic optimism\u2019. Most entrepreneurs\noverestimate their chance of success. If unrealistic optimism is indeed pervasive, policies\nwhich encourage lending are called into question. Should governments really be luring\npeople to ruin themselves?\nEconomists typically sidestep such issues by assuming that individuals are the best\njudges of their own interests. Burgeoning evidence of numerous cognitive biases make this\na questionable foundation for welfare economics. Only recently has there been sustained\ndiscussion of the normative implications of self-harm and mechanisms to discourage it\n(see e.g. O\u2019Donoghue & Rabin, 2003; Camerer et al., 2003; Sunstein & Thaler, 2003).\nThis paper focuses on the public finance implications of a well documented bias with\npotentially important consequences.\nMost economists have an instinctive distrust of \u201cpaternalistic\u201d intervention. Demon-\nstrating that systematically irrational private behavior prevails is certainly not enough\nto justify corrective policy. The danger lies in providing governments with a ready made\nexcuse to adopt corrupt and destructive policies based on unsubstantiated hunch. Even\nif politicians are not self seeking they too may be prone to unrealistic optimism in be-\nlieving that they can improve matters (Glaeser, 2003). A reasonably innocuous policy\nrecommendation is that accurate information should be provided so as to allow \u201ccorrect\u201d\nchoices to be made. Yet the reasons that lead to initial error may make people immune\nto education, as the experimental results reported here do indeed suggest.\n2\nThe perspective of this paper is that identifiable cognitive biases create distortions\nwhich may be much the most important source of efficiency loss in the economic system. In\nremedying the efficiency problem the standard theory of tax\/subsidy policy is in principle\napplicable. The implication is that start-up finance should be taxed. We go no further\nthan advocating that subsidies are withdrawn, thereby avoiding slippery slope arguments.\nEven to go this far represents a major change in government policy. In the US, the\nSmall Business Administration (SBA), a government agency, has provided loan guarantees\nto small businesses since 1953. In 1997 Congress passed an SBA funding bill providing\nover $50 billion for the SBA\u2019s business loan programs.1\nIt is not just the US. Most governments think it meritorious that more people set\nup new businesses. The UK Government has announced \u201cA new drive to boost the\nenterprise culture, encourage more people to set up their own business and reduce the\nbarriers facing start-up firms ...particularly [amongst] under-represented groups, such as\nwomen, ethnic minorities and [in] disadvantaged parts of the country.\u201d (Department of\nTrade and Industry, 2002a). The European Commission has recently published a Green\nPaper on \u201cEntrepreneurship in Europe\u201d (2003). The aim is to encourage more people to\nbecome entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship is seen as \u201cfirst and foremost a mindset\u201d (p.5)\nalthough the importance of unrealistic optimism is not mentioned. Psychology aside, it\nis reported that \u201cAccess to finance remains a major barrier for new entrepreneurs\u201d (p.\n11) and schemes to overcome this, such as the UK Governments Loan Guarantee Scheme\nto small businesses, are praised. The latter scheme is set to back some 5000 loans per\nyear, targeted towards borrowers that banks would otherwise have rejected (Department\nof Trade and Industry, 2002b)\nPolicies of this sort reflect a view that \u201c. . . lack of capital holds back millions of poten-\ntially entrepreneurial people in the industrial countries.\u201d (Blanchflower et al.,2001, p690).\nEconomists\u2019 support for intervention is much influenced by theories of informational fric-\ntions in credit markets. Most notably, Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) explained credit rationing\non the basis of asymmetric information. Their story is that if banks increase interest rates\ntoo much, bank lending may become less profitable. There are two reasons for this. As\ninterest rates rise, entrepreneurs with safe projects tend to be the first to drop out. A safe\nproject is solvent in most states, so the expected realised cost to the entrepreneur of the\nextra repayment is high. Risky projects with a small chance of yielding the entrepreneur\na bonanza typically have higher chances of complete failure. The high default probability\n1In addition the Community Reinvestment Act provides banks with incentives for lending to small\nbusinesses in low-income areas.\n3\nmeans the expected cost to the entrepreneur of an interest rate rise is low. So, if entre-\npreneurs are approximately risk neutral, banks unable to judge whether an entrepreneur\nhas a risky or safe project will find that beyond a certain point expected repayments\nfall as the interest rate increases. Reinforcing this selection effect is an incentive effect.\nSuppose all entrepreneurs are identical but once they are granted a loan, they have a\nchoice whether to implement a safe or a risky project. The bank knows this option exists\nfor the entrepreneur but can do little to effectively monitor the choice. It could be that\nvery risky projects deliver lower expected gross revenue but that does not prevent rational\nentrepreneurs from picking them. As previously explained, the risky projects have lower\nexpected repayments so may be more advantageous to the borrower even though they\nalso have lower expected returns. Moreover, the difference in the expected repayment\nbetween a safe and a risky project is greater when interest rates are high. As a result,\nhigher interest rates may induce borrowers to switch to riskier projects. This increases\nthe banks\u2019 default rate, perhaps by so much that their expected repayment eventually\nfalls as rates rise.\nConsider now the interest rate that maximises the banks\u2019 expected revenue per loan.\nThere will be an associated rate that if paid to depositors results in the banks just breaking\neven. Yet if the banking system faces an upward sloping supply of deposits there may\nnot be enough funds forthcoming to make loans to all the entrepreneurs applying. In\nresponse to excess demand it is usually profitable for sellers to raise price. Not so here.\nThe selection and incentive effects mean that an increase in the interest rate lowers bank\nprofitability (so too would a reduction in the interest rate). Banks therefore make as\nmany loans as they can, randomly selecting which entrepreneurs receive them. This is the\nfamous credit-rationing result. Applicants denied credit are nearly all willing to pay higher\nthan quoted interest rates and as a group are no different to those obtaining funding.\nThere has been little evidence of credit rationing in this sense (e.g. Berger and Udell,\n1992 and Parker, 2002) but redlining, a related phenomenon, is widespread. Suppose\nthat it is possible to observe that an individual belongs to a group, say those living in\na particular area. The bank cannot tell much about the characteristics of individual\nloan applicants but does know the distribution of characteristics of those in the area.\nIt is therefore possible to draw up a group-specific relationship between the interest rate\ncharged by the banks and the expected revenue per loan. As before, selection and incentive\neffects may mean that the relationship is not monotonic and at its turning point the\nexpected return per loan may not be enough to allow the banks to attract depositors. If so,\nno one applying from this area may be granted a loan. They are \u201credlined\u201d. Those living\nin an adjacent area may have a slightly more profitable distribution of characteristics,\n4\ngood enough to bring the maximum revenue per loan above the cost of granting it. So,\nin the first area it is impossible to get a loan at any interest rate but in the second,\nonly minimally different in the composition of borrowers, loans may be available at quite\nlow rates. Moreover, in the redlined zone, the expected surplus per applicant at the\nmaximising interest rate may be large. So if the group is only just redlined, a negligible\nfinancial subsidy can generate considerable welfare gain. This redlining analysis does not\ndepend on the supply of deposits being upward sloping.\nThe observable characteristic could be wealth rather than geographical area. There\nis an incentive for entrepreneurs to provide maximum self-finance or post all available\nassets as collateral. Doing so limits moral hazard which brings down interest rates more\nthan proportionately. In addition, entrepreneurs with safe projects are willing to accept\na smaller cut in the interest rate for a given increase in self-finance. So self-finance is a\nsignalling device and not investing own wealth in the project is a poor message to send to\nthe bank. The redlining analysis can therefore be applied to groups identified by wealth\n(which is posted as collateral). It is not that low-wealth borrowers are charged more for\nfinance it is simply unavailable to them.2\nThere is a host of evidence consistent with redlining on the basis of wealth. Holtz-Eakin\net al. (1994a, 1994b), Evans and Leighton (1989), Blanchflower and Oswald (1998) and\nEvans and Jovanovic (1989) among many others, find that wealth increases the propensity\nto become self-employed, even after controlling for the possible correlation between entre-\npreneurial ability and wealth. Bond and Townsend (1996) report that in a low-income,\nprimarily Mexican neighborhood in Chicago, only 11.5 percent of business owners financed\ntheir start-up with a bank loan, while 50 percent of the respondents financed their start-up\nentirely out of their own funds.\nThe widespread practice of credit scoring is direct evidence of redlining with respect\nto other factors. Banks attach weights to individual characteristics and only grant loans\nif the overall mix is sufficiently good. In most places it is illegal to use characteristics\nsuch as race or gender but it remains controversial whether this occurs in practice (e.g.\nMunnell, et. al. 1996, Blanchflower et. al. 2003; Ross and Tootell, 2004).\nThe now standard theory thus accounts for some of the key facts of credit markets\nand provides a justification for intervention on efficiency grounds.3 Part of the appeal\n2Of course lower wealth requires larger loans, but raising the repayment in proportion does not bring\nin compensating revenue. First, moral hazard is greater. Second, with less of their own wealth at stake,\nlower-quality entrepreneurs apply. So a high-wealth group that it is just viable to lend to is no longer so\nif its members experience a fall in wealth.\n3It is not always true that asymmetric information leads to under-lending. De Meza and Webb (1987)\n5\nof the model is that remedial policies designed to bring excluded groups into the market\nare likely to yield distributional as well as efficiency gains. Yet if optimism replaces\nrational expectations, all the policy conclusions change. The observational properties of\nthe model are unchanged; credit rationing, redlining and related phenomena still arise.\nThe difference is that entrepreneurs wanting loans but failing to obtain them may be\nbetter off than those receiving loans. Policies directed towards increasing lending, in\nparticular those focussed on excluded borrowers, such as loan guarantee schemes may be\nparticularly harmful.\nThe next section of the paper reviews psychological evidence for unrealistic optimism\nand findings which suggest that it is important in entrepreneurial settings. Then a model\nis built which justifies our claims concerning the positive and normative implications of\noptimism. This shows that taxing lending may directly raise welfare and that a statutory\nexemption on the assets that can be claimed by the creditor in the event of default may\nbe beneficial. Section 4 contains a summary of an experimental credit market in which\nthe extent and implications of optimism can be precisely determined. The gains from\ndiscouraging lending are large and selection effects are inconsistent with standard models.\nSubjects act on their beliefs but their beliefs are unrelated to the truth. This may also help\nto explain recent difficulties in finding evidence of asymmetric information in insurance\nmarkets. Finally, conclusions are drawn.\n2. The Psychology of Optimism\n2.1. The Meaning and Measurement of Unrealistic Optimism\n\u201cAccording to popular belief, people tend to think that they are invulnerable. They\nexpect others to be victims of misfortune, not themselves\u201d (Weinstein 1980, p. 806). This\nhopeful outlook on life implies \u201can error in judgement\u201d which Weinstein called unrealistic\noptimism or optimistic bias. The terms unique invulnerability (Perloff, 1983) and positive\nillusions (Taylor and Brown, 1988) are also applied to describe similar phenomena. What\nis referred to is an underestimation of the likelihood of experiencing negative events and\nan overestimation of the probability of experiencing positive events. Put alternatively,\nexpectations are irrational so the mean forecast error is significantly different from zero.\nshow that if entrepreneurs differ in ability rather than intrinsic risk there is too much lending. In a\npooling equilibrium the able types cross-subsidise the less able who are consequently induced to enter\nthough they would not do so under full information. When moral hazard is added this overlending result\nis consistent with credit rationing and wealth dependency of lending (de Meza and Webb 1999, 2000).\n6\nThe evidence is that optimistic biases are robust and widespread whilst pessimistic biases\nare relatively rare.\nUnrealistic optimism is then distinct from risk preference, the willingness to take\ngambles at given odds. Furthermore, being unrealistic optimistic, is not the same as\nbeing overconfident. The latter is also a positive illusion, but it refers to an excessive\nprecision in forecasting, i.e. confidence intervals are too narrow.\nThe direct measure of unrealistic optimism is (minus) the difference between an indi-\nvidual\u2019s subjective estimate of the probability of a (bad) good event occurring and the\ntrue value of the probability. Few psychological studies attempt to measure unrealistic\noptimism, firstly, because of the difficulty in determining the accurate probability for a\nparticular individual and secondly, because of the difficulty individuals have in under-\nstanding and providing probabilities (Gigerenzer, 2002; Weinstein & Klein, 1996). In-\nstead, the usual approach is to investigate whether people think an event is more or less\nlikely to happen to them than to their peers; a comparative rather than absolute measure.\nA vast amount of evidence supports the existence of optimistic biases. Among many\nother positive events, most students think they have a better chance than their peers of\nliking a job, owning their own home, and having a high starting salary. Drinking problems,\nsuffering a heart attack before age 40, divorce a few years after marriage, being fired from a\njob and not finding another within 6 months are all rated as more likely to occur to others\nin their peer group (Weinstein, 1980). Typical is the finding of Guthree, Rachlinski and\nWistrich, 2001, that in a gathering of US judges 90% thought their decisions less likely to\nbe reversed than the median reversal probabability of those present. The optimistic biases\nare not limited to questionnaire responses concerning remote events, but are also present\nin real, immediate and visually vivid risky situations, such as novice bungee jumpers who\nperceive their own risk of injury to be less than the risk of the typical bungee jumper\n(Harris et al., 1996). Evidence also exists on men who have tested seropositive for the\nHIV virus who are actually more optimistic about not developing AIDS than men who\nhave tested seronegative for the virus (Taylor et al., 1992). Similarly, studies aimed at\nanalyzing the progress of the degree of optimism after an experience with a stressful event\n(such as earthquakes or exposure to intense radiation) show that the positive illusion that\nthe stressful negative event is more likely to happen to others than to oneself tends to\nreturn after a relatively short period of time (Burger and Palmer, 1992).\nDespite its potential importance for policy, there is much less research on absolute op-\ntimism. Fischoff Slovic and Lichenstein (1977) and Lichtenstein, Fischhoff and Phillips,\n(1982) find people considerably over-estimate the probability their answers are correct\nby some 50%. Weinstein et al. (1996) examined the accuracy of personal risk estimates\n7\nof college students for hazards such as pneumonia, suicide, motor vehicle accident, di-\nvorce, obesity, and pregnancy. Optimism was the norm. Strecher et al. (1995) report\non 2,785 patients completing a questionnaire including a health risk appraisal and ques-\ntions regarding smoking behaviour and perceived health risks of heart attack, cancer, and\nstroke. While most smokers accurately perceived their health risks to be greater than\nnon-smokers, smokers were also more likely to underestimate their health risks.\n2.2. Determinants of optimism\nWeinstein\u2019s (1980) pioneer study examined a range of positive and negative real life events\nthat might occur sometime in the future to determine the extent of optimistic biases and\nthe conditions under which they occur. It seems that two conditions must be fulfilled\nfor the optimistic bias to arise: (1) the event is perceived as controllable (i.e. there are\nthings one can do or contemplate doing to influence the event) and (2) people have some\ndegree of commitment or emotional investment in the outcome. In both cases the desire\nto protect self-esteem may be at work.\nIn addition to these self-serving biases, there are other systematic errors that give\nrise to optimism in identifiable circumstances. There is evidence (Weinstein et al., 1996)\nsupporting Kahneman and Slovic\u2019s theories on people\u2019s tendencies to overestimate small\nprobabilities and to underestimate large ones. When the events in question are respec-\ntively good and bad, optimism is the result. Furthermore, Weinstein (1980) finds that\nunfamiliarity with a contingency breeds optimism with the correlation stronger for nega-\ntive hazards.\nStraightforward cognitive error is a further source of optimism. Most people taking\npsychometric tests know they are noisy. Even with no prior view of how they differ from\nthe population they take their actual score as the best point estimate despite scores above\nthe mean being more likely to be biased upwards and those below downwards. Such base\nrate neglect leads people with above average experience to be optimists (de Meza and\nSouthey,1996 Landier and Thesmar, 2003).\n2.3. Entrepreneurial optimism\nThe factors just discussed suggest that business start-ups are incubators of optimism.\nFirstly, entrepreneurs typically have most of their personal wealth tied up in the business\nso that their degree of commitment or emotional investment in the outcome is extremely\nhigh and hence they tend to be especially optimistic about the result. Secondly, individ-\nuals are more optimistic about outcomes they believe are under their control and setting\n8\nup a business is certainly an activity in which an illusion of control is likely to be felt.\nThirdly, there is evidence that people tend to overweight unlikely events and underweight\nlikely ones (e.g. Gonzalez and Wu, 1999). As only some 30% of new businesses make\nit through 5 years, failure is a high-risk event and so one would expect positive illusions\nto be widespread. Finally, since starting a new business is inevitably uncharted territory\nthere is scope for unchecked fantasizing and optimism is more likely.\nPositive illusions do indeed seem to impact on economic decision making in general4,\nand in the entrepreneurial setting in particular. Here we summarize some relevant findings\non start-ups.\nThere is striking evidence on the discrepancy between financial returns to self-employment\nand to paid employment, yet entrepreneurs are not dissuaded. The U.S. Small Business\nAdministration (1997) found that one-sixth of self-employed individuals earn less than\nthe minimum wage. On the face of it this might reflect people being forced into self-\nemployment due to low skills. Hamilton (2000) shows though that even controlling for a\nwide variety of characteristics, entrepreneurs enter and persist in business despite the fact\nthat they have both lower initial earnings and lower earnings growth than they could have\nachieved in paid employment. It is unlikely this is due to selection effects since the prior\nwage distribution of those becoming self-employed does not appear to be significantly\ndifferent from that of paid employment stayers. Nonpecuniary benefits could be part of\nthe explanation but entrepreneurs are sacrificing substantial earnings lending plausibility\nto the notion that misperceptions are implicated.\nThe evidence of Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) is similar. They find that the\nreturn on family businesses is no better than on public equity but the risk is far greater.\nUnrealistic optimism is one of five possible explanations given by Moskowitz and Vissing-\nJorgensen to explain the seemingly perverse exposure to greater risk uncompensated by\nhigher returns.\nLooking at innovation by independent inventors, \u00c5stebro (2003) reports even more\nstriking commitment to loss making ventures. The chance of innovations reaching the\nmarket is approximately 7%. Of the \u201clucky\u201d 7%, some 60% realise negative returns and\nthe average realised return among those that commercialise their inventions is minus 7%,\neven ignoring the cost of the inventor\u2019s often enormous effort. Many inventors persist in\n4One of the earliest applications of optimism to economics was to corporate takeovers. Roll (1986)\nargues that hubris on the part of executives of acquiring firms explains why M&As typically destroy\nvalue. Malmendier and Tate (2002) test this idea showing that directors in acquiring companies increase\ntheir equity stake during M&As despite such stock under-performing the market.\n9\ntrying to bring their ideas to market despite receiving good advice that the prospect of\nmaking money is negligible, calling into question the rationality of entry decisions.\nAn ingenious experiment by Camerer and Lovallo (1999) sheds light on the implications\nof optimistic illusions for entry decisions when all that matters is relative performance.\nTheir subjects must choose whether to enter a tournament or take a fixed payment. Fewer\nparticipate in the tournament when winners are determined randomly from amongst the\nentrants than when determined by relative performance on a quiz. Rationality suggests\nthe opposite should occur if people have any information about their relative ability at the\nquiz. Most subjects who enter think the total profit earned by all entrants will be negative,\nbut their own profit will be positive. When subjects are told that quiz performance will\nbe important excess entry further increases. These self-selected subjects seem to neglect\nthe fact that they are competing with a reference group of subjects who all think they\nare skilled too (\"reference group neglect\").5\nConsistently with these results, in a sample of some 3,000 entrepreneurs, Cooper,\nWoo,and Dunkelberg (1988) report that 81% believed their chance of success to be at\nleast 70% and 33% believed their chance to be a certain 100%. Only 39% think that any\nbusiness like theirs is likely to succeed.\nPinfold (2001) reports on the returns actual business founders in New Zealand expect\nand the level of risk they believe they are taking. His survey shows that in the eyes of New\nZealand\u2019s entrepreneurs, starting a new business is an attractive proposition: considerable\nfinancial rewards coupled with many additional advantages (nonpecuniary benefits such\nas independence, personal development, and employment). Furthermore, while realizing\nthat there are risks involved, these entrepreneurs tend to underrate the risk and have\nfaith in their personal ability to overcome the odds. They prefer to lay the blame for\nfailure on the incompetence of the participants rather than regarding failure as a likely\nconsequence of inescapable risk. The sampled New Zealand business founders consistently\nbelieved the probability of their venture failing to be less than half the historical rate6 and\nthey estimated rewards that were considerably higher than those obtained by business in\ngeneral. The survey results show then that the high degree of unrealistic optimism about\nreturns and about the ability to beat the odds provides an explanation for the oversupply\nof new ventures, which will result in very high rates of failure.\n5Larwood and Whittaker (1977) report on students and executives playing a marketing game. Most\nsubjects think their chance of winning exceeds the average but it is not directly shown that these beliefs\ndrive entry.\n6Entrepreneurs rated the chances of their business surviving its first five years at 75.7%, which was\n23.5% higher than they rated the chances of other similar start-ups.\n10\nFurther evidence on self-employed expectations is supplied by Arabsheibani et al.\n(2000). They surveyed the answers to the following two questions from the British House-\nhold Panel Study:\n1. \u201cWould you say that you yourself are better off, worse off or about the same financially\nthan a year ago?\u201d\n2. \u201cLooking ahead, how do you think you yourself will be financially a year from now,\nbetter than you are now, worse off than now or about the same?\u201d\nThe authors find that the self-employed expect better financial outcomes than employees\nbut experience worse realizations. For the self-employed the ratio of those making opti-\nmistic errors (realization below forecast) to pessimistic errors (realization above forecast)\nis 2.13 whereas for employees the corresponding figure is 1.55. Somewhat similar results\nare found by Landier and Thasmar (2003) for a sample of French entrepreneurs.\n2.4. The survival value of optimism\nUse of systematically wrong probabilities impairs decisions so must optimists eventually\nbe driven out by realists? There are reasons why optimism benefits the individual, at least\nat some point in evolutionary history. Even in equilibrium, evolution does not necessarily\nlead to a population of rational agents who revise their beliefs according to Bayes\u2019 rule.\nThere may be better uses of limited brain capacity, or there may be a stable equilibrium\nin which offsetting dysfunctional adaptations survive.\nWaldman (1994) shows that the potential stability of second-best adaptations in a\nworld of sexual inheritance provides a possible explanation for why a propensity to sys-\ntematic error may persist. According to Waldman, the unique first-best adaptation is\nfor males to accurately estimate their own abilities and receive no disutility from effort,\nnevertheless a second-best adaptation (i.e., an adaptation such that a trait is optimal\ntaking as fixed the value of the other trait) may arise. Consider a male who receives\ndisutility from effort. If this individual estimates his abilities accurately, he would choose\nan effort level that is smaller than the one that maximizes his accumulation of wealth.\nOverestimating abilities offsets this \"distortion\" since, with appropriate functional forms\nthe individual\u2019s incentive to apply effort increases. The individual is pushed away from\nutility maximization and towards wealth maximization.\nBernardo and Welch (2001) invoke group selection.7 They argue that entrepreneurs\nbuck trends and this is socially valuable. They then show that since groups with some op-\n7Sinn and Weichenrieder (1993) discuss biological foundations for risk preferences from this perspec-\ntive.\n11\ntimistic individuals have an evolutionary advantage over groups without such individuals\nthis may be enough for the trait to survive.\nOptimism may confer private strategic advantages. As we show in Section 3, optimists\nmay apply more effort than realists. This is no bad thing as debt or equity contracts create\na moral-hazard problem leading to the undersupply of effort. So if optimism is observable,\ncompetitive markets will reward it with higher payoffs. A similar story applies if team\nproduction is important. With the contribution of individuals difficult to measure there\nis a tendency towards free-riding. Optimists, overestimating the effectiveness of their\neffort, will offset this effect and will thus be more sought after as team members. Again\nif optimism is identifiable, it need not be a liability. It may be that in hunter-gatherer\nsociety, where social groups are small, aspects of character such as optimism become\nknown though optimism is not so well adapted to the larger societies of today. A further\nevolutionary possibility is that in attracting mates it is important (especially for males)\nto offer prospects of future material success. Really believing in the truth of claims is the\nbest way to persuade others. Hence, optimism may be a good reproductive strategy even\nif it actually impairs future material success. If so women\u2019s best response is to excel in\nthe psychology necessary to detect false claims.\nSomewhat similarly, in competitive situations observable optimism may amount to a\nprecommitment to higher output, an aggressive strategy. As long as rivals are producing\nstrategic substitutes this boosts payoffs. Heifetz & Spiegel (2001) develop an explanation\nfor unrealistic optimism along these lines.\n3. Modelling Credit-Market Optimism\nThis section builds a simple model showing that optimism helps explain the major empir-\nical regularities of business-loan markets whilst turning the usual policy prescriptions on\ntheir head.8 Not only does optimism affect the entry decision, it may also impact on the\nsubsequent running of the business through its influence on strategic decisions and the\nchoice of effort. Overrating the effectiveness of their input creates a substitution effect\ninducing entrepreneurs\u2019 to raise their effort. In addition, there is an analogue of an income\neffect whereby the entrepreneur believes that their talent is such that only a little input is\nneeded to achieve all that can reasonably be done. The specification chosen here implies\n8de Meza and Southey (1996), Niehans (1997), Manove and Padilla (1999) all follow Smith in suggest-\ning that entrepreneurs will be drawn disproportionately from the \u201csuper optimists\u201d but address different\nquestions and do not integrate the moral hazard and optimism.\n12\nthat effort increases (for some evidence that this is the sign of the effect see Landier and\nThesmar, 2003). Optimism may also result in the choice of high risk strategies that lower\nexpected returns though this will not be modelled.9\nIt is initially assumed that entrepreneurs are identical in their objective capacities but\ndiffer in their optimism. This leads to variations in entry decisions and in effort choices.\nThe case of heterogeneous ability is then discussed.\nThe structure of the model is that there are many risk-neutral banks and many risk-\nneutral potential borrowers. Each potential entrepreneur has a project which yields H if\nsuccessful, zero otherwise. For simplicity, H is independent of the number of successful\nentrepreneurs, as might be the case when output is sold on the world market or when\neach entrepreneur serves his own market niche.\nThe objective success probability, P (e), depends on non-verifiable effort e:\nP (e) = ae (3.1)\nwhere a is a constant representing \"ability\". Entrepreneurs differ in their opinion on the\neffectiveness of their effort and perceive their (subjective) probability of success as\np(e) = a\u03bbe (3.2)\nwhere \u03bb is uniformly distributed on [1, 2]. So all potential entrepreneurs are optimists but\nbelieve themselves to be realists. This formulation implies that effort and optimism are\ncomplements i.e. an entrepreneur perceives a higher marginal effect of his effort on his\nsuccess probability the higher his degree of optimism.\nThe cost of effort is given by C(e) = e2\/2. Each project requires capital input K.\nEntrepreneurs have initial wealthW (< K). External finance is in the form of a standard\nbank loan. One explanation for debt as the equilibrium form of finance follows from\noptimism. Suppose project realisation is verifiable. Since every entrepreneur perceives the\nprobability of the H outcome to be greater than does the bank, the equilibrium contract\nminimises repayment in the H state, a debt contract (see de Meza and Southey,1996,\nManove and Padilla,1999, Heaton, 2002, Hackbarth, 2002, and Landier and Thesmar,\n2003). Alternatively, if project outcome is not verifiable then equity finance is not possible\nand the only feasible contract involves a fixed payment D with the bank seizing the\nentrepreneur\u2019s assets if the payment is not made. Despite the publicity attracted by\n9Gibson and Sanbonmatsu (2004) find evidence that optimists (as measured by a personality test)\npersist longer than pessimists in the face of gambling losses and eventually lose more money. This suggests\nthat optimists may wait too long before closing failing businesses.\n13\nventure capitalists, empirically, the role of equity in startups is very limited (Bank of\nEngland, 2001).\nEntrepreneurs post their wealth W (< K) as collateral.10 If the project fails, the\nentrepreneur forfeitsW minus x, the statutorily protected assets.11 Banks do not observe\nindividuals\u2019 types but do know the frequency distribution of types. If the bank offers a\nloan, it demands a repayment D if the project succeeds and seizes W \u2212 x(< D) if the\nentrepreneur defaults.\nThe model is solved explicitly in the Appendix. Here the key properties of the model\nand their implications are summarised and discussed.\n(i) Given D, the substitution effect implies that effort is increasing in optimism. So\nmore optimistic individuals are more likely to succeed, but not to the extent that they\nbelieve they will.\n(ii) Borrowers\u2019 effort is decreasing in the level of protected assets since the stick for\nfailure is then less severe.\n(iii) The higher is D the lower is effort since the carrot for success is then smaller.\nThis is the familiar moral hazard effect. Note though that optimism offsets the effort\ndamping of a positive D. It is possible that the more optimistic types supply more than\nthe efficient level of effort.\n(iv) The decision to apply for a loan depends on whether the borrowers expected utility\nevaluated at the subjective probabilities, SU, exceeds non-entry utility,W. Hence, there is\na threshold level of optimism above which a loan is applied for.\n(v) Beyond some level, further increases in D reduce the expected bank revenue per\nloan, R. This is due to the moral-hazard effect. Offsetting this is the advantageous\nselection resulting from the least optimistic and hence lowest effort types dropping out\nas D increases. Given the functional forms chosen here, R reaches a maximum which is\nincreasing in W and a.\n(vi) There is a critical value of W below which, whatever D is chosen, banks cannot\nearn enough revenue to cover the competitive return on deposits. These borrowers are\nredlined. If a varies across individuals and is observable then the redlined groups will be\nthose with wealth\/ability combinations below some threshold.\n(vii) Although there is a threshold wealth below which a group is redlined, above this\nlevel it is ambiguous whether entry increases in wealth. When wealth is high there is less\n10Equivalently, the entrepreneur invests W directly in the project and borrows K \u2212W. Were it costly\nto liquidate assets the collateral route is strictly preferred.\n11Optimists would want to escape statutory asset protection by liquidating their resources to provide\nmaximum self finance. Sufficient liquidation costs make this strategy unattractive.\n14\nmoral hazard. In a competitive capital market these costs are borne by the borrower so\nreduction of deadweight cost encourages entry. In addition, higher wealth means lower\nat-risk lending, and as there is pooling across types, the cross-subsidy from the more\noptimistic to the less optimistic is lessened. As the less optimistic types are the marginal\nentrants, this discourages entry. The Appendix shows that entry first increases with wealth\nand then decreases. So in a cross section of individuals, the entry rate of those with high\nwealth may exceed those with lower wealth. An increase in the mandatory protection of\nassets from seizure is equivalent in its positive effects to a fall in wealth. Such a change\naffects all borrowers, so the increase in the numbers entering in the relatively high wealth\ngroups may exceed those exiting from lower wealth groups.\nA non-monotonic relationship between start-ups and the assets the state protects from\nseizure by creditors, is shown empirically by Berkowitz and White (2003), Fan and White\n(2004). They investigate the impact of variations in homesteading laws between US states.\nGreater asset protection increases redlining and there is an initial tendency for start-ups\nto be encouraged. The latter effect is attributed to the benefit of the implicit insurance\nprovided. This explanation fails to account for why, if utility is raised by greater asset\nprotection, a competitive market would not supply the optimal asset protection, at least\nif, as they assume, agents are rational and well informed.\n(viii) Unlike in Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) groups that are redlined are better off out of\nthe market and welfare would be increased further were some further exclusion to occur.12\nConsider a group on the verge of being redlined. The marginal entrepreneur, has SU\nequal to W but, being optimistic, their objective utility is below W . The intramarginal\nentrepreneurs are even worse off. This is because expected utility measured at objective\nprobabilities, OU, declines in \u03bb.13 So, if a group is close to being redlined, every member of\nit would be better off were they denied loans. Policies can be devised that target redlined\ngroups, such as loan guarantee schemes, but they are invariably designed to bring them\ninto the market rather than exclude them. In this model it would be unambiguously\nharmful to introduce such a policy.\n(ix) Policies that affect all borrowers, not just those close to being redlined, are harder\nto assess. Consider a non-prohibitive tax on all lending. This increases redlining and the\nrise in the interest rate causes the least optimistic types from the non-redlined groups to\nexit. This is all to the good, at least as long as objective utility is the criterion. The\n12The criterion is the aggregate realised welfare of the group (equivalently, expected utility evaluated\nat true success probabilities).\n13Only realists (\u03bb = 1) choose effort to maximise OU and as optimists choose higher effort levels, their\nOU must be lower.\n15\nhigher D also discourages effort. Normally this would aggravate moral hazard, but here\noptimism may result in an excessive level of effort on the part of some entrepreneurs.\nThus the tax may also improve matters on this score. As is confirmed in the Appendix,\na tax may increase the expected utility of entrepreneurs even if they receive none of the\nproceeds. Perhaps of more relevance, a subsidy is not only costly for tax payers but lowers\nthe welfare of borrowers.\n(x) Varying the level of protected assets also has mixed effects on welfare. Some groups\npreviously eligible for loans will now be redlined by the banks. As already shown, in this\nmodel exit is unambiguosly a gain. For groups still able to borrow, an increase in protected\nassets (equivalent to a fall in wealth) increases repayments and so effort declines offsetting\nthe possibly excess level created optimism. In addition, the increase in protected assets\nmay either raise or lower entry, these effects being respectively good or bad. Even when\nentry occurs, the overall impact of an increase in protected assets may be to benefit the\nentrepreneurs, as the Appendix shows.\n(xi) Extending the model to encompass heterogeneous ability (unobservable by banks)\nadds new insights. Start from the case of realistic entrepreneurs. Suppose that at the\nequilibrium D the threshold ability level above which entry occurs is a\u2217. Now suppose\nthat some or all of the potential entrants are optimistic. Everyone that entered under\nrealism will still enter, but there will be some extra applicants who wrongly think that\ntheir ability is above a\u2217. If optimism does not affect or lowers effort14 then the effect of\noptimism is certainly to lower the quality of lending and depress bank revenue for a given\nD. Thus optimism may create redlining where it would not be present under realism.\nEven if optimism raises effort and does not worsen other operating decisions, the fact\nthat it draws in lower-ability types may create redlining.\n(xii) Other things equal, an entrepreneur\u2019s SU is decreasing in their ability. So with\nheterogeneous but unobservable ability, there is a tendency for the marginal borrowers\nin the pooling equilibrium to be of lower ability and hence are less profitable than the\nintramarginal types. This was shown for rational agents by de Meza andWebb (1987) who\nconclude that restricting lending, say through a tax, would increase aggregate surplus.\nOptimism reinforces this tendency in so far as marginal types enter when it is not even\nin their private interest to do so.15\nFinally it no longer necessarily follows that redlined groups are better off out of the\n14A function with this property is p = 1\u2212 (\u03bbe)\u03b7+1 \u03b7 < \u22121\n15If ability and optimism are inversely correlated then the marginal borrowers may be the least likely\nto default. It then follows that the tax on lending should be prohibitive or else there should be a marginal\nsubsidy to raise quality. This is discussed further in the policy section.\n16\nmarket. With heterogeneous types and realism every loan applicant correctly anticipates\nnon-negative expected gains, so it is strictly better that a just redlined group is funded.\nAdding optimism means that many applicants have negative expected utility measured\nat objective probabilities. Whether it is efficient to bring in excluded groups depends on\nthe strength of optimism and the diversity of abilities.\nTo summarise the main results of the model, by inducing the relatively incompetent to\napply for funds, optimism may create or increase redlining. Granted that welfare should\nbe measured by expected utility evaluated at objective probabilities (or by realised utility)\nthe implication of optimism is that, even in the presence of redlining, taxing lending will\nbe beneficial and subsidising it harmful. Moreover, increased statutory protection of assets\nmay induce additional entry, a finding that is otherwise difficult to explain, and this may\nraise welfare.\n4. Experimental Evidence of Entrepreneurial Optimism\nThough individuals may provide questionnaire answers indicating unrealistic optimism,\ntheir motives may be to impress the interviewer or even themselves. When it comes to\ndecisions with financial consequences, cooler judgements may apply. It is difficult though\nto draw definite conclusions from field data. Observing low average returns to start-\nups may be due to misperceptions, mismeasurement, the psychic benefit of being one\u2019s\nown boss, or risk aversion. Experimental methods overcome some of the problems. We\nnow summarise findings from the experiment of Coelho (2003) which allows the effect of\noptimism to be clearly identified.\nThe experiment replicates the theoretical model of Section 3 for the case of heteroge-\nneous abilities except there is no explicit moral-hazard dimension.16 This is also the set\nup of de Meza and Webb (1987) except their theoretical analysis assumes entrepreneurs\nare unbiased in estimating their own success probabilities. Combined with the assumption\nthat outside financiers only know the population distribution of abilities the result is over-\ninvestment. The experiment tests for the presence of unrealistic optimism and for whether\nbeliefs are even correlated with performance. It turns out that the most important source\nof welfare loss is not the familiar hidden-types problem but the irrational expectations of\nthe agents normally assumed to have superior private information. These beliefs are so\n16Subjects do not know the size of the prize for success till they have played, effectively eliminating\nmoral hazard. Nevertheless optimism and its relation to performance can be detected although credit\nrationing of the form in the model cannot arise.\n17\noff beam as to undermine the selection effects analysed in de Meza and Webb.\n4.1. The experimental design\nThe experiment involves three main parts: (1) subjects play one or two practice rounds\nof a skill-based task (the \u201cgame\u201d) (2) they make two sets of payoff relevant choices (3)\nthey play the game for real. Each stage is now described in more detail followed by an\nitalicised commentary on the reasons for the chosen format.\n\u2022 Subjects first played practice round(s) of a skill-based task for which success and\nfailure are clearly defined. One \u201cproject\u201d was counting down 2 minutes within an accuracy\nof 10 seconds and another was directing a hoop round a wire course without triggering\nan alarm.\nSetting up a business involves the entrepreneur backing themselves to succeed in a\nchallenge involving skill and luck. The experimental tasks embody (in a convenient form)\nrelated uncertainties. We considered but rejected using more intellectual tasks. The fact\nthat business success does not appear to be strongly correlated with IQ was not the most\nimportant reason for doing so. IQ is often entangled with ego and choices may be driven\nby a desire to impress the experimenter or avoid embarrassment. Moreover, many subjects\nmay have a good idea of their IQ whereas at the outset people typically have a much less\nprecise idea of their business acumen. The trial rounds provided the subjects with partial\ninformation and we were interested to see whether base rate neglect resulted in the pattern\nof success and failure increasing distortions in the real choices.\nIn the next part of the experiment, participants had to make two sets of nine choices\neach. At the end of the experiment, one of the 18 questions was selected at random and\nthe subject\u2019s winnings were calculated according to their choices on that question.\n\u2022In the first set of nine questions (the first set of questions or FSQs) subjects were\nasked to choose between receiving a prize of \u00a38 if they succeed in the skill-based task, or\n\u00a38 with a specified probability P increases across nine options from 10% to 90%.\nThese questions are designed to measure optimism rather than to directly represent\nbusiness choices.17 Since the prizes are the same for the both alternatives choices should\nbe independent of risk preference with the skill-based option selected if the subject considers\nthink their chance of success is at least P . So, the P at which an individual switches from\nbacking their skill to preferring a random payoff measures their (motivated or \u201cimplicit\u201d)\nforecast of success in the skill-based task. If subjects are optimists the average success rate\nof the subjects would be below the average switching P . Even if there is optimism, as long\n17Though once a business is underway choices of this sort might arise.\n18\nas forecasts to some degree reflect ability, success rates should be increasing in the switch\nP .\n\u2022 The second set of choices (the SSQs) required subjects to choose between \u00a34 for sure\nor a prize of \u00a3z (\u00a3z varied from \u00a35 to \u00a313 in a set of 9 questions) for succeeding in the\nskill-based task but with no payment for failure.\nThe $4 option can be regarded as paid employment, a safe option, and the \u00a3z the\nreward from succeeding in a business venture. In this interpretation the business venture\nrequires external finance and \u00a3z is the return after repayment of the loan. Decreasing the\ninterest rate is represented by increasing \u00a3z. Assuming that lenders have no information\nabout individuals characteristics (or are not allowed to use their information), everyone\nis charged the same interest rate. Given a particular equilibrium interest rate, the subjects\ndivide between the two options according to their switch z.\nIf individuals are rational there will be a threshold value of z above which the skill based\noption is chosen. Those switching at higher zs are either more risk averse or consider\nthey are less likely to succeed in the task. Risk preferences can be estimated by using the\nsubjective probability of success elicited from the FSQs to evaluate individuals\u2019 expected\nwinnings at the switch \u00a3z. Under risk aversion, the average winnings of those preferring\nthe skill-based task at a given interest rate will not be less than the safe payment. If risk\naversion does not vary with the SSQ switch point then, if beliefs even if biased, are at\nleast positively correlated with performance are, the proportion of those succeeding would\nfall as the interest rate decreases. The difference between the average winnings of those\nopting for the skill-based option and the safe alternative of $4 is a conservative estimate\nof the losses from faulty decisions in the SSQs.\n\u2022Finally, subjects played the game for real. Before the FSQs were answered, a ran-\ndomly selected 50% of the subjects were told the overall success rate and asked to make an\nexplicit forecast of the chance they would succeed at the skill-based task.18 The remain-\ning subjects were told the overall sucess rate after answering the SSQs and then asked to\nasked to forecast their own success probability.\n4.2. Results\nThe subjects were 85 LSE students. Table 1 compares the average success rate on the\nskill-based task with the forecast implicit in the FSQ switch points and with the explicit\nforecast. There is considerable optimism with forecast of success well in excess of the\n18Participants choose from ten options ranging from \u201cbetween zero and one in a ten chance\u201d to \u201cmore\nthan nine in a ten chance\u201d.\n19\nactual success rate. Although implicit and explicit forecasts averaged across all tasks\nwere close to 50%, this does not seem to reflect an equal ignorance principle. The means\nwere significantly different according to task and there was considerable dispersion within\ntasks. Moreover, the beliefs revealed in the FSQs were important determinants of the\nSSQs choices.19\nAverage success rate 27%\nAverage mid FSQ switch probability 50%\nAverage lowest FSQ switch probability 45%\nAverage mid explicit forecast 47%\nAverage lowest explicit forecast 42%\nTable 1\nThe timing of the explicit forecast question made no significant difference to the rela-\ntion between the explicit and implicit forecasts.\nTo check whether subjects acted on their beliefs, the switching zs in the SSQs were\nregressed on the switching Ps from the FSQs. It can be seen from (4.1) that there is a\nsignificant relationship between subjects\u2019 perception of their ability to succeed in the skill\nbased task and the minimum prize for which they were prepared to choose this activity\n(with t-statistics in parenthesis).\nSSQ = 11.7\u2212 5.9FSQ (4.1)\n(26.64) (\u22127.32)\nAdjusted R2 = 0.41\nTo see whether those selecting into the skill based activity are those with a comparative\nadvantage at it, a probit was run of success in the skill activity on the FSQs switch point\n(standard errors in parenthesis).\nSuccess = \u22120.79 + 0.35FSQ (4.2)\n(\u22120.39) (0.71)\n19As the subjects select a probability interval we report results on the basis that point switches were\nuniformly distributed within the interval (the \u2018mid\u2019 point of the interval) and also if they were clustered\nat the end point least favourable to optimism.\n20\nPsuedoR2 = 0.0024\nAs FSQ is not significant, the implication is that people are not at all self aware.\nA similar exercise using explicit forecasts rather than implicit forecast yielded the same\nconclusion. Knowing only that one individual is much more confident that they will\nsucceed than is another is no help in predicting which of them is most likely to succeed.\nThe results reported to this point suggest that there will be no relationship between\nthe magnitude of the prize required to tempt a subject to back their own ability and\ntheir actual performance. Neither adverse nor advantageous selection is present. Those\nchoosing the entrepreneurial activity at high interest rates are just as likely to succeed as\nthose opting for it at low interest rates. It could be the case, though, that the extreme\nobservations have predictive value, but that this gets lost in the full pooling because of\nuninformed people in the middle of the SSQ switch points distribution. So, a comparison\nof success rates of the groups with highest and lowest switch \u00a3zs was under taken, choosing\ncut offs to reasonably balance the numbers, was carried out. Results in Table 2 show that\nthe success rates for the two groups in the table are not significantly different and so they\nconfirm the lack of relation between the magnitude of the prize to back own skills and\nactual performance.\nSSQ switch point % of subjects in each group Success rate in each group\nBelow or equal to \u00a37.5 35.1% 29.6%\nAbove or equal to \u00a310.5 20.8% 25%\nTable 2\nSubjects requiring the highest prizes to enter the skill activity were slightly less suc-\ncessful on average than those requiring smaller prizes, but the difference is not statistically\nsignificant. Thus interest rates do not have a selection effect. As neither advantageous\nnor adverse selection effects are present, there is no need for policy to offset these sources\nof market failure. This does not mean that there is no welfare issue. The general tendency\nto overestimate the chance of success means there is considerable scope for improvements.\nConsider the 58% of subjects choosing to back their skill when the prize for succeeding\nis \u00a38. Their average winnings were some \u00a32.40 whereas they could have had \u00a34 for sure.\nSo eliminating the option to back their skill would have made them financially better\noff. Before concluding that removing the option would be welfare enhancing at least two\nobjections should be considered.\n21\ni) It could be argued the subjects are risk loving and deliberately sacrifice expected\nincome for thrills. However, using the procedure outlined above if anything subjects were\nrisk averse.\nii) Perhaps the subjects enjoy playing the skill game. Of itself that would not give rise\nto the observed pattern of FSQs and SSQs choices since the game is played irrespective\nof the answers. There is though the possibility that subjects anticipate that they will feel\nbetter if they win through a skill-based option rather than a random device. This would\ngenerate FSQs switch points above explicit forecasts of success. The fact that there was\nno significant difference between mean forecasts and FSQs switch points (whichever of the\ntwo was asked first) is evidence against this interpretation. Moreover, even if the lower\nof FSQs switch point and forecast is used to proxy expectations, substantial optimism\nremains.\nIn summary, there is clear evidence that people have exaggerated views of their own\nability and act on these beliefs. Moreover, perceptions are uncorrelated with performance,\nso interest rates have neither an adverse nor advantageous selection effect.\n5. Policy\nGiven that subjects make systematic errors in evaluating the expected returns to the skill-\nbased activity, the least intrusive intervention would be to issue a warning explaining the\nerror and reporting the true mean success rate. The cognitive biases that lead to the\nerror would though quite likely lead to such warnings being ignored. In fact information\non overall success rates was provided to half the participants prior to the choices being\nmade and it made no difference to the distribution of the switch points.\nDiscouraging the skill-based activity through taxation is more drastic. The motive\nis not to curtail an externality, but because people act on false information.20 There\nare at least two obvious dangers. There may be private benefits to the choices that the\nresearcher has missed. Even if this is not so, once the principle of paternalism is accepted\nthe floodgates may be released for all sorts of inappropriate intervention.\nAs for the first objection, it certainly only makes sense to act when evidence of error\nis strong. Moreover, the existence of unmeasured benefits from entry leaves the case for\nintervention unaffected when there is misperception of the chance of success. What is\ncertainly unjustified is to intervene in the \u201cwrong\u201d direction as appears to be the case\n20In reality there are often positive externalities to start up success and negative ones to failure. It is\nnot clear where the balance lies.\n22\nwith present encouragements to set up new businesses. Subsidies make the recipients\nworse off even before the financial cost is counted. The second objection should of course\nbe taken seriously but already there are many paternalistic policies around, such as the\nlicensing of medicines and doctors, tobacco taxes and seat belt legislation.\nGiven that fiscal policy is to be used to improve decisions, how in this instance should\nit be implemented? Irrespective of the SSQs switch point, the subjects have a success rate\nof around 30%. As private information is no help in predicting success, if any subjects\nshould be excluded from the skill-based activity then all should. Given the numbers in\nthe experiment, only if the value of succeeding in the skill activity is at least \u00a313 are\nobjectively expected earnings a match for the safe alternative. Assuming that there is\nno externality associated with success, if the market determined prize is below \u00a313, to\nmaximise aggregate surplus it would be best to impose a prohibitive tax. For market\ndetermined prizes above this level, even realists would enter, so the displayed level of\noptimism does not yield any misallocation of activity.\nTwo features give rise to the all or nothing policy. It has been implicitly assumed\nthat tax revenue is a pure transfer. In fact raising tax revenue from other sources may be\ndistortionary so a rational government will choose the level of public spending so that at\nthe margin it is more valuable than private spending. This premium on tax revenue means\nthat even if entrepreneurs are objectively worse off choosing the skill based activity, it\nshould not be taxed out of existence. Moreover, if there is a positive correlation between\nbeliefs and performance, even with optimism an interior solution for the optimal tax is\non the cards. Such a tax drives out the lowest-quality types only drawn in by optimism\nbut higher-quality types that would enter even under realism remain active.\nTo see the issues, define F (x) as the cumulative distribution function of SSQs switch\npayoffs. There is a tax of t on the actual success income z. Granted risky debt, this could\nequally well be a tax per loan or on bank deposits.21 The true average probability of\nsuccess of the entrants is \u03a0(z \u2212 t) . A conventional selection effect implies \u03a00 < 0. The\nsafe payoff is S and \u03b1 measures the private value of an additional dollar of government\nspending. Assuming potential entrepreneurs are risk neutral (risk aversion strengthens\nthe tax case), the policy objective is to choose t to maximise\nW = F (z \u2212 t)((z \u2212 t)\u03a0(z \u2212 t)\u2212 S) + \u03b1tF (z \u2212 t)\u03a0(z \u2212 t) (5.1)\ndW\ndt\n= \u2212F 0(z\u03a0\u2212 S)\u2212 F\u03a00z + (\u03b1\u2212 1)[F\u03a0\u2212 t\u03a0F 0 \u2212 tF\u03a00] (5.2)\n21We are assuming the subjects would behave the same when z=10 as when z=12 and t=2.\n23\nAccording to the experimental results, \u03a0z < S , \u03a00 = 0, F 0 > 0 , so if \u03b1 = 1 it is\noptimal to increase the tax till no subjects participate in the skill based activity. If these\nconditions do not apply, interior solutions are possible. When \u03b1 > 0 the benefit from a\ntax is initially greater but now the premium on tax revenue means that it may be best to\nstop short of a prohibitive tax.\n6. Conclusions\nAccording to psychologists, optimism is all around. It would be surprising were economic\ndecisions immune to these biases and this paper has surveyed field and experimental\nevidence suggesting they are not. The vast bulk of public economics analyses the welfare\nconsequences of fiscal policy and other interventions assuming that people take decisions in\ntheir own best interests. Hence the justification for policy is distributional or to counteract\nexternalities. To suggest that policy should combat self-delusion is a good deal more\ncontroversial. The evidence reported here suggests the problem cannot be sidestepped by\nsupposing that misperceptions are minor or random.\nCurrent policy towards business start-ups is to encourage them. Entrepreneurs\u2019 unre-\nalistic optimism is a reason for neutrality. A few good apples may attract all the publicity\nbut this should not divert attention from most of the barrel being bad. Just as Adam\nSmith observed that the focus on the few high profile successes attracted too many as-\npiring opera singers, so the same may be true of entrepreneurs. The issue is especially\npoignant in the case of minority and disadvantaged groups. Policy makers are generally\nparticularly keen that finance should be channelled to people in such categories. The\nanalytical model of this paper indicates that doing so may create a royal road to ruin. In\nthe experiment reducing the prizes for the entrepreneurial activity actually increases the\nsubjects income.\nThis paper has not tried to judge whether start-ups do confer positive externalities.\nTo the extent that this is the case, there is an argument for subsidies even if optimism is\nalso present. In evaluating the case that new businesses are a good thing in themselves,\nat least two notes of caution should be taken on board. A common argument, made for\nexample in the EC Green Paper, is that most new jobs are created in start-ups. True, but\nbecause start-ups so often fail, a year or two down the line they are also responsible for\ndestroying more jobs than established firms. Moreover the failure of a business is generally\nbad news for customers and suppliers, negative externalities that are often ignored.\nIn some respects our modelling of optimism has underemphasised its costs. First, it\nwas supposed that though optimists were excessively keen to set up businesses, the effect\n24\nof optimism was to increase effort and so offset the distortions created by the presence\nof outside financiers. In fact effort may rise by so much due to optimism that, despite\nthe disincentive of debt repayment, it ends up inefficiently high. There is though another\ndimension by which optimismmay have a negative influence (suggested by Kahneman and\nLovallo (1993)). Once in business choices must be made between alternative strategies.\nOptimists will tend to overestimate chances of success so will mistakenly often opt for\nbusiness strategies involving mean-reducing spreads of payoffs. They will also back options\nthat depend on their own overestimated skill as opposed to relying on the expertise of\noutsiders. These are forces making the performance of optimists inferior to that of realists.\nA second issue is risk aversion. The model assumed risk neutrality and the experiment\nfound this to be a good approximation when the payoffs were reasonably small. With\nlarger payoffs risk aversion may be a more appropriate assumption. Optimists think\nfailure less likely than do the financiers so will continue to prefer contracts that concentrate\nreturns in the success states (de Meza and Southey, 1996) but with risk aversion the cost\nis that optimists are, objectively, underinsured. Policy should try to offset this. Statutory\nhomestead laws that protect assets in the event of failure and more lenient bankruptcy\nprovisions in general amount to compulsory insurance. This would be an added merit of\nsuch legislation. When optimism is taken seriously the rules of public finance must be\nrethought.\n7.

Appendix: Solving the model\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s utility evaluated at subjective probabilities is\nSU = p (H \u2212D +W ) + (1\u2212 p)x\u2212 C(e) = x+ p (H \u2212D +W \u2212 x)\u2212 C(e)(A.1)\n= x+ a\u03bbe (H \u2212D +W \u2212 x)\u2212 e2\/2.\nMaximising SU yields effort\ne\u2217 = a\u03bb (H \u2212D +W \u2212 x) (A.2)\nwith maximum SU\nSU\u2217 = x+\n\u00b5\n1\n2\n\u00b6\na2\u03bb2 (H \u2212D +W \u2212 x)2 . (A.3)\nBorrowers\u2019 effort is decreasing in the level of protected assets.\nThe socially optimal effort level, maximising PH \u2212 C(e), equals\nes = aH. (A.4)\nComparing e\u2217and es, notice that optimism offsets moral hazard: the interest payment D\n(> W \u2212 x) dampens effort, but this effect may be more than counteracted by optimism,\n\u03bb.\nA potential entrepreneur applies for a loan if SU\u2217 \u2265W or\n\u03bb \u2265 \u03bbm \u2261\n\u221a\n2A\na (H \u2212D +A) (A.5)\nwhere A \u2261 W \u2212 x. Hence, only the most optimistic individuals, those with \u03bb above the\nmarginal value \u03bbm, want to enter. Notice that there is an advantageous rather than adverse\nselection effect of an increase in D. A higher interest rate deters the least optimistic\nborrowers who have the highest default risks. Nevertheless an increase in D decreases\nthe effort of all entrepreneurs that remain active and this moral hazard effect eventually\ncauses bank revenue to decline in D.\nExpected bank revenue from a loan is\nr = PD + (1\u2212 P )A = P (D \u2212A) +A. (A.6)\nTaking into account the applicant self selection, revenue per loan is\n30\nR = A+ (D \u2212A) a2 (H \u2212D +A)\nZ 2\n\u03bbm\n\u03bb\n2\u2212 \u03bbm\nd\u03bb (A.7)\n= A+ a (D \u2212A)\n\u00c3\na (H \u2212D +A) +\nr\nA\n2\n!\nwhich is concave in D, with turning point at\nD\u2217 = A+\nH\n2\n+\n1\n2a\nr\nA\n2\n(A.8)\nand corresponding maximum revenue\nR\u2217 = A+\n1\n4\n\u00c3\naH +\nr\nA\n2\n!2\n. (A.9)\nIncreasing the interest rate beyond a certain point, lowers bank revenue. This is not\ndue to adverse selection; as D rises, less optimistic types drop out of the market which\nincreases bank revenue. There is however a moral hazard problem. D acts as a tax on\nreturns so as it increases, the incentive to apply effort is reduced so that the default rate\nrises.\nAt the competitive equilibrium, ignoring discounting, R = K + t where t is a lending\ntax. Solving this zero-profit condition for D gives the equilibrium interest rate\nD(A) =\n1\n2\n\u00c3\nH + 2A+\n1\na\n\u00c3r\nA\n2\n\u2212\np\nd(A)\n!!\n(A.10)\nwhere\nd(A) =\n\u00c3\na (H + 2A) +\nr\nA\n2\n!2\n+ 4ac(A) (A.11)\nand\nc(A) = \u2212aA (H +A)\u2212A\nr\nA\n2\n+\nA\u2212 (K + t)\na\n. (A.12)\nNote that if d(A) < 0 there is no lending as all possible interest rates lead to a loss.\nGroups with As for which d(A) < 0 are therefore redlined. It is easy to see that an\nincrease in x (decrease in A) or an increase in t will lead to more redlining. Specifically,\nredlining occurs when\nA < Ar \u2261\n2\n81\n\u00b3\n2\np\n9(K + t)\u2212 2a2H2 \u2212 aH\n\u00b42\n. (A.13)\n31\nFigure A.1:\nAlthough there is a threshold wealth below which a group is redlined, above this level\nit is ambiguous whether entry increases in wealth. To illustrate, suppose H = 0.8, a =\n0.5, K = 0.1, t = 0.01.For these parameter values d(A) < 0 for A < 0.0378. Potential\nentrepreneurs with low initial wealth or a high level of protected assets, such that A is\nbelow this threshold are redlined.\nIn this example \u03bbm(A) =\n\u221a\n2A\na(H\u2212D(A)+A) is non-monotonic in A as Figure 1 shows.\nAt low wealth levels, close to the redlining threshold, there is very little entry. Even for\noptimists, the deadweight cost of moral hazard raises interest rates too high for entry to be\nworthwhile. The number of entrepreneurs is initially increasing in wealth but drops at high\nwealth levels due to the shrinkage in cross subsidy. Entry is maximised (\u03bbm minimised)\nfor A = 0.0815 with the corresponding equilibrium \u03bbm = 1.16. This demonstrates that an\nincrease in the mandatory protection of assets from seizure in the event of default may\nincrease lending.\nNow turn to welfare effects. The objective utility of an entrepreneur is given by\nOU = a2 (H \u2212D +A)2\n\u00a1\n\u03bb\u2212 \u03bb2\/2\n\u00a2\n+ x (A.14)\nso that the expected utility per borrower equals\nx+\na2 (H \u2212D +A)2\n2\u2212 \u03bbm\nZ 2\n\u03bbm\n\u00a1\n\u03bb\u2212 \u03bb2\/2\n\u00a2\nd\u03bb (A.15)\n= x+\na2\n6\n(H \u2212D +A)2 (2 + \u03bbm) (1\u2212 \u03bbm) .\nThe expected net gain per loan, g, is the difference between this expected objective utility\nand the payoff from staying out of the market, W :\n32\nFigure A.2:\ng =\na2\n6\n(H \u2212D +A)2 (2 + \u03bbm) (1\u2212 \u03bbm)\u2212A (A.16)\nThe aggregate gain from lending is thus\nG(A) =\n\u00b5\na2\n6\n(H \u2212D (A) +A)2 (2 + \u03bbm (A)) (1\u2212 \u03bbm (A))\u2212A\n\u00b6\n(2\u2212 \u03bbm (A)) (A.17)\nAn increase in protected assets (decrease in A) makes banks less willing to lend. The\nequilibrium interest rate increases, which reduces excessive effort. Although the effect\nof an increase in protected assets on entry is ambiguous, as shown in Figure 2, in this\nnumerical example welfare is greater at higher levels of protected assets.\nTurning to a lending tax, the equilibrium interest rate \u2206 as a function of the tax \u03c4 is\n\u2206(\u03c4) =\n1\n2\n\u00c3\nH + 2A+\n1\na\n\u00c3r\nA\n2\n\u2212\np\n\u03b4(\u03c4)\n!!\n(A.18)\nwhere\n\u03b4(\u03c4) =\n\u00c3\na (H + 2A) +\nr\n0.08\n2\n!2\n+ 4a\u03c8(\u03c4) (A.19)\nand\n\u03c8(\u03c4) = \u2212a(A) (H +A)\u2212A\nr\nA\n2\n+\nA\u2212 (K + \u03c4)\na\n(A.20)\nIncreasing the tax raises \u2206 and lowers borrowing. The aggregate net gain (for A =\n0.08) as a function of the tax is\nG(\u03c4) =\n\u00b5\na2\n6\n(H \u2212\u2206(\u03c4) + 0.08)2 (2 + Lm (\u03c4)) (1\u2212 Lm (\u03c4))\u2212 0.08\n\u00b6\n(2\u2212 Lm (\u03c4)) (A.21)\n33\nFigure A.3:\nwhere\nLm(\u03c4) =\np\n2(0.08)\na (H \u2212\u2206(\u03c4) + 0.08) . (A.22)\nA lending subsidy costs money and destroys utility, but a tax yields direct benefits,\nas can be seen in Figure 3, and raises revenue.\n34\n"}
