Readers were\ninvited to submit comments on an article by Davis and Denning entitled: 'Almost as help-\nful as good theory: some conceptual possibilities for the online classroom' (Davis and\nDenning, 2000). Summarized below are some of the key comments raised about the paper.\nMany thanks to everyone who took the time to send in these comments; individual\nacknowledgements have not been included for reasons of confidentiality.\nReaders' comments\nComments fell into four main categories. The first addressed the paper's contribution to the\nlearning technology field. Some readers felt the paper to be quite difficult to understand,\nperhaps because it seems preliminary and speculative. One reader commented that in many\nrespects Davis and Denning were exploring surprisingly uncharted waters. Others added\nthe following comments and observations:\nThe paper is interesting in that it provides a framework for thinking about 'dimensions\nof practice' in virtual learning environments. This is timely and the area certainly lacks\nrobust theoretical frameworks of the sort that this paper is trying to devise.\nThis is an insightful categorization of typologies of 'group function in cyberspace'. The\nsix conceptual areas, and the discussion of group function (and dysfunction) in each\narea will provide a useful framework for future researchers.\nSome of the requests were simply for additional context:\n5\nGrainne Conole, Martin Oliver and jane Seale Time to experiment...\nMention is made at several points in the paper of 'action science groups' - this seems to\nbe an important aspect of their work and would benefit from fuller exposition, as many\nreaders will not be familiar with 'action science groups'.\nThere are several places where claims are made which would benefit from further\nsubstantiation either by reference to the literature or their own data.\nThe distinction between different Basic Assumption groups and Work groups was not\nclear and needs to be made more explicit.\nOthers, however, raised questions of interpretation and application:\nThe paper identifies that the theorizing it contains is based upon 'ongoing action\nresearch' over a three-year period. However, there is very little explicit connection made\nbetween the framework and the theoretical analysis that is provided with this underlying\ndata. This is reflected by the comment in the conclusion that the model\/framework that\nis presented is 'the product of inspiration and intuition based on our iterative analysis of\ndata'. The relationship to the data should really be drawn out more strongly throughout\nthe paper - perhaps simply by including some illustrative quotes\/examples.\nThe paper describes 'two main theoretical sources' (group dynamics and situated\nlearning). Whilst the group dynamics thread does permeate the paper, the situated\nlearning thread was much less clear. For example, there seems to be a leap from situated\nlearning to learning dynamics in Table 1.\nSome more analysis of the interaction between 'conceptual areas and their\ncorresponding states' and 'types' (based on the data rather than on supposition) is\nneeded before the model can be thought to be robust. However, the authors seem to be\naware of this and the framework does provide a useful starting point for analysis even\nprior to this work taking place.\nThe authors use scaffolding to mean 'students building upon one another's comments'.\nThis is a rather restricted way of using this term, which is more usually used (within the\ncontext of learning) to mean providing support for learners (through the means of\nchannels) - stemming from the work of Vygotsky.\nThe title of the paper suggests a playful reference to Kurt Lewin ('nothing so practical\nas a good theory') but there is little evidence in the paper of ways of evaluating the\nutility of the 'conceptual possibilities' alluded to in the title. Indeed, it was rather hard\nto say exactly what these might be.\nSome of the language was a little off-putting - why use ersatz psychology when there are\nplenty of good and relevant constructs in scientific psychology?\nFinally, there were some comments that challenged aspects of the paper, such as the\nfollowing:\nThere is concern about whether the 2x2 matrix is an appropriate extrapolation from the\nsix conceptual areas. It appears that in fact there are already six dimensions to the\nmatrix. From these six dimensions, four typologies are observed which are then reduced\n(back-mapped) to the two axes. A more common use of the 2x2 matrix is to characterize\nthe points on the two scales and then build the representation of the quadrants from the\n6\nALT-J Volume 10 Number I\npositions of the respondents along the x and y axes respectively. This is not in any way\nto suggest that the four typologies are not both accurate and useful. It does, however\nquestion how the addition of two more dimensions 'depth' and 'time' will be achieved.\nOne alternative to retaining the 2x2-matrix model and to testing and extending it would\nbe to characterize each axis formally as 'Learning Dynamics' and 'Group Dynamics' (in\ncyberspace). Alternatively, researchers might wish to work with the underlying 6-\ndimension array. If a visual representation of outputs was required, spider diagrams\ncould be used instead of 2x2 matrices! If researchers used consistent scales along the six\ndimensions, each of the typologies would have a characteristic 'shape'. Other groups\ncould then be analysed and their 'shapes' compared with the four typologies.\nThese last questions and issues are, perhaps, the most interesting to focus upon - this exper-\niment was intended to promote debate, rather than consensus! In the following article,\nDavis and Denning respond to these comments. We would be very interested to hear\nreaders' views on the value of this form of more interactive, in-depth discussion on one of\nthe papers. Please email us with your thoughts.\nReferences\nDavis, M. and Denning, K.
