In the 16718 women (46%) who were not taking\npersonal calcium supplements at randomisation the\nhazard ratios for cardiovascular events with calcium and\nvitamin D ranged from 1.13 to 1.22 (P=0.05 for clinical\nmyocardial infarction or stroke, P=0.04 for clinical\nmyocardial infarction or revascularisation), whereas in\nthe women taking personal calcium supplements\ncardiovascular risk did not alter with allocation to calcium\nand vitamin D. In meta-analyses of three placebo\ncontrolled trials, calcium and vitamin D increased the risk\nof myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.21 (95%\nconfidence interval 1.01 to 1.44), P=0.04), stroke (1.20\n(1.00 to 1.43), P=0.05), and the composite of myocardial\ninfarction or stroke (1.16 (1.02 to 1.32), P=0.02). In meta-\nanalyses of placebo controlled trials of calciumor calcium\nand vitamin D, complete trial-level data were available for\n28072 participants from eight trials of calcium\nsupplements and the WHI CaD participants not taking\npersonal calcium supplements. In total 1384 individuals\nhad an incident myocardial infarction or stroke. Calcium\nor calcium and vitamin D increased the risk of myocardial\ninfarction (relative risk 1.24 (1.07 to 1.45), P=0.004) and\nthe composite of myocardial infarction or stroke (1.15\n(1.03 to 1.27), P=0.009).\nConclusions Calcium supplements with or without\nvitamin D modestly increase the risk of cardiovascular\nevents, especially myocardial infarction, a finding\nobscured in the WHI CaD Study by the widespread use of\npersonal calcium supplements. A reassessment of the\nrole of calcium supplements in osteoporosis\nmanagement is warranted.\nINTRODUCTION\nCalcium supplements, with or without vitamin D, are\nwidely used for the prevention and treatment of osteo-\nporosis. Recently, we reported increases in rates of\ncardiovascular events in women allocated to calcium\nsupplements in the Auckland Calcium Study, a five\nyear randomised, placebo controlled trial in healthy\nolder women, in which cardiovascular events were\npre-specified secondary end points.1 Subsequently,\nwe carried out ameta-analysis of cardiovascular events\nin randomised, placebo controlled trials of calcium\nsupplements (without vitamin D co-administration).2\nCalcium supplements significantly increased the risk\nof myocardial infarction by 31% in five trials involving\n8151 participants where patient level data were avail-\nable, and by 27% in 11 trials involving 11 921 partici-\npantswhere trial level datawere available.2 Therewere\nno statistically significant increases in the risk of stroke;\nthe composite end point of myocardial infarction,\nstroke, or sudden death; or death (relative risks or\nhazard ratios ranged from 1.07 to 1.20), but the meta-\nanalyses did not have sufficient power to detect effect\nsizes of these magnitudes.2\nAn important question that arises is whether co-\nadministered calcium and vitamin D affects cardio-\nvascular risk. TheWomen\u2019s Health Initiative reported\nno adverse effect of calcium and vitamin D (1 g cal-\ncium\/400 IU vitamin D daily) on any cardiovascular\nend point in their large (n=36 282), seven year, rando-\nmised, placebo controlled trial.3 4 However, 54% of the\nparticipants were taking personal (non-protocol)\n1Department of Medicine,\nUniversity of Auckland, Private Bag\n92 019, Auckland 1142, New\nZealand\n2Health Services Research Unit,\nUniversity of Aberdeen,\nForesterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD,\nScotland\nCorrespondence to: I R Reid\ni.reid@auckland.ac.nz\nCite this as: BMJ 2011;342:d2040\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.d2040\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 9\ncalcium supplements at randomisation and 47% were\ntaking personal vitamin D supplements, effectively\nrendering this trial a comparison of higher dose and\nlower dose calcium and vitamin D for most of the par-\nticipants.\nAllowing clinical trial participants free access to the\nintervention being studied is unusual and has the\npotential to obscure both adverse and beneficial\neffects. We hypothesised that the frequent personal\nuse of calcium supplements might have obscured an\nadverse effect of calcium and vitamin D on cardio-\nvascular risk. Therefore,we analysed the limited access\ndataset of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative Calcium\/\nVitamin D Supplementation Study (WHI CaD\nStudy) to determine whether there were interactions\nbetween personal use of calcium supplements and allo-\ncation to calcium and vitamin D supplementation for\ncardiovascular events. Using data from women not\nusing personal calcium supplements at randomisation\nin the study, we have updated our previous meta-ana-\nlysis to provide the best current estimate of the effects\nof calcium supplements, with or without vitamin D, on\nthe risk of cardiovascular events.\nMETHODS\nAnalyses of WHI CaD Study\nThe design and results of the WHI CaD Study have\nbeen published in full.3 4 Medical records related to\nself reportedmedical events for myocardial infarction,\nstroke, and coronary revascularisation were adjudi-\ncated centrally by physician adjudicators using stan-\ndardised definitions, and all deaths were also centrally\nadjudicated.4 We obtained the WHI limited access,\nclinical trials dataset from the National Heart Lung\nand Blood Institute. A statistical analysis proposal\nwas submitted to the institute before the database was\nmade available.\nWe attempted to replicate the approach of theWHI\ninvestigators where possible, carrying out pre-\nspecified analyses looking for interactions between\npre-specified subgroups based on use (no use v any\nuse) and dose (0, 1\u2013499, 500\u2013999, \u22651000 mg\/day) of\npersonal calcium supplements at randomisation for\ncardiovascular events. We pre-specified assessment\nof four cardiovascular end points and their combina-\ntions: myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisa-\ntion (coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous\ncoronary intervention), death from coronary heart dis-\nease, and stroke. Serial electrocardiograms were car-\nried out in the WHI CaD Study, allowing detection\nof silent myocardial infarctions. Because silent myo-\ncardial infarctions were not determined in any of the\ntrials in ourmeta-analysis, we analysed data separately\nfor clinicalmyocardial infarctions and totalmyocardial\ninfarctions (including clinical and silent myocardial\ninfarction).We have reported four different composite\nend points: total deaths from myocardial infarction or\ncoronary heart disease (themajor outcome reported in\ntheWHICaDStudy); clinicalmyocardial infarction or\ncoronary revascularisation (representing clinical cor-\nonary heart disease events); clinical myocardial infarc-\ntion or stroke (the composite end point most similar to\nthat used in ourmeta-analysis of calciummonotherapy\ntrials); and totalmyocardial infarction, coronary revas-\ncularisation, and death from coronary heart disease\n(representing all coronary heart disease events).\nWe have reported the baseline characteristics at the\ntime of randomisation to the WHI CaD Study,\nwhereas the WHI investigators reported these charac-\nteristics at the time of entry to the WHI programme.\nFor bodymass index and for dietary and supplemental\ncalcium intake, we used the latest value recorded\nbetween screening and onemonth after randomisation\nto the study.\nTo assess the effect of calcium and vitamin D on the\ntime to first event for each end point, we used Cox\nproportional hazards models stratified by age, preva-\nlent cardiovascular disease at baseline, and randomisa-\ntion status in the WHI Postmenopausal Hormone\nTherapyTrials andDietaryModificationTrial, follow-\ning the approach of theWHI investigators.3 4 Compar-\nisons between subgroups were assessed using\ninteraction terms. The assumption of proportional\nhazards was tested by performing a test for\nTable 1 | Characteristics of participants in the WHI CaD Study at randomisation, grouped by\npersonal use of calcium supplements.

Of note, only 1.2% of participants were\ntaking non-protocol calcium supplements in the trials\ncontributing patient-level data in our previous meta-\nanalysis of calcium supplements,2 and two of the six\nstudies contributing trial-level data permitted non-\nprotocol calcium supplements.9 10 We used the same\nmethods as for our previous meta-analysis:2 the effect\nof calciumor calcium and vitaminDon the time to first\nevent was assessed with Cox proportional hazards\nmodels stratified by study for patient-level data, and\ntrial-level summary data were pooled using random\neffects models.2 The assumption of proportional\nhazards was tested as described above.\nAll analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1\n(SAS Institute, Cary NC, USA) or Comprehensive\nMeta-analysis version 2 (Biostat, Englewood NJ,\nUSA). All tests were two tailed and P<0.05 was consid-\nered significant.\nRESULTS\nReanalysis of the WHI CaD Study\nTable 1 shows the characteristics of the participants at\nrandomisation to theWHICaDStudy groupedbyper-\nsonal use of calcium supplements: 54% of participants\nwere taking personal calcium supplements. The base-\nline characteristics of the participants allocated to cal-\ncium and vitamin D or to placebo seemed well\nmatched for the subgroups defined by use of personal\ncalcium supplement. However, participants using per-\nsonal calcium supplements differed from those not\nusing personal supplements in some factors associated\nwith cardiovascular disease: age, body mass index,\nblood pressure, use of hormone replacement therapy,\nhistory of myocardial infarction or stroke, and smok-\ning (P<0.05 for these variables) (table 1).\nTable 2 shows the influence of personal use of cal-\ncium supplements on the effect of calcium and vitamin\nD on cardiovascular end points and mortality from all\ncauses. There were significant interactions between\nallocation of calcium and vitamin D and personal use\nof calcium supplements for clinical myocardial infarc-\ntion, stroke, and the composite end point of myo-\ncardial infarction or stroke. In women not taking\npersonal calcium supplements, the hazard ratios with\ncalcium and vitaminDwere 1.16 (P=0.04) for the com-\nposite end point of clinical myocardial infarction or\ncoronary revascularisation, 1.16 (P=0.05) for clinical\nmyocardial infarction or stroke, 1.22 (P=0.05) formyo-\ncardial infarction, and 1.13\u20131.20 for the other cardio-\nvascular end points.

There were no significant\nthree-way interactions between calcium and vitaminD\nallocation, personal calcium supplement use, and diet-\nary calcium intake (above or belowmedian) for cardio-\nvascular end points (P>0.4). We repeated these\nanalyses in the subgroup of women not using personal\ncalcium supplements and found no interactions\nbetween calcium and vitamin D allocation and dietary\ncalcium intake (above or below the median) for any\ncardiovascular end point (P>0.5). Finally, we repeated\nall these analyses using dietary calcium intake grouped\nby tertile, and the results were similar. Together, these\nanalyses suggest that the relation between calcium and\nvitaminD allocation and cardiovascular events is inde-\npendent of dietary calcium intake.\nIn a sensitivity analysis, we searched the WHI med-\nication database to identify participants potentially tak-\ning calcium supplements not captured elsewhere,\nusing WHI medication class codes for common cal-\ncium supplement preparations (791000, 791099,\n781230, 783500, 783600, 483000, 489900, and\n489910).We identified 930 participants listed as taking\na calcium supplementbefore randomisation to calcium\nand vitaminDbut recorded as having no supplemental\nintake of calcium at randomisation.Whenwe repeated\nthe analyses including these women classified as using\npersonal calcium supplements, the results were similar\n(data not shown).\nPersonal vitamin D supplements were used in com-\nbinationwith personal calcium supplements by 44% of\nparticipants in the WHI database, and without perso-\nnal calcium supplements by 3% of participants. When\nwe repeated the analyses grouping participants by per-\nsonal use of calcium and\/or vitamin D supplements,\nthe results were similar (data not shown).\nMeta-analysis of calcium and vitamin D versus placebo\nWe analysed trials comparing co-administered cal-\ncium and vitamin D with placebo.

Figure 3 shows that calcium or\ncalcium and vitamin D supplements increased the\nrisk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 1.26,\nP=0.005), stroke (1.19, P=0.03), and the composite\nend point of myocardial infarction or stroke (1.17,\nP=0.005). The hazard ratio for death (all causes) was\n1.04 (0.95 to 1.14, P=0.4).\nThe number needed to treat with calciumor calcium\nandvitaminD for five years to cause one incident event\nwas 240 for myocardial infarction, 283 for stroke, and\n178 for the composite end point. The corresponding\nnumber needed to treat to prevent one fracture was\n302. Treating 1000 people with calcium or calcium\nand vitamin D for five years would cause an additional\nsixmyocardial infarctions or strokes and prevent three\nfractures.\nTrial-level data\nComplete trial-level datawere available for 28 072par-\nticipants in nine trials (the WHI CaD study and eight\nrandomised, placebo controlled trials of calcium\nsupplements).1 8 9 11-17 In total, 676 individuals had an\nincident myocardial infarction, 764 an incident stroke,\n1384 an incident myocardial infarction or stroke, and\n1835 died during an average trial durationweighted by\nstudy size of 5.7 years. Figure 4 shows that the results\nwere similar to the patient-level analyses. Calcium or\ncalcium and vitamin D supplements increased the risk\nof myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.24, P=0.004)\nand the composite of myocardial infarction\/stroke\n(1.15, P=0.009). The relative risk of death (all causes)\nwas 1.04 (0.95 to 1.13, P=0.5).\nIn a sensitivity analysis, we added all available data\nfrom three further randomised, placebo controlled\ntrials of calcium supplements10 18 19 and one trial of cal-\ncium and vitamin D supplements7 (limited to data on\ndeaths in trial or trial withdrawals) to the analysis of\ncomplete trial-level data. Data were available for\n29 277 participants (WHI CaD Study, 11 trials of cal-\ncium supplements, and one trial of calcium and vita-\nmin D): 679 individuals had an incident myocardial\ninfarction, 768 an incident stroke, 1393 an incident\nmyocardial infarction or stroke, and 1857 died during\nfollow-up.With calciumor calciumandvitaminD sup-\nplements, the relative risks were 1.25 (1.08 to 1.45,\nP=0.003) for myocardial infarction, 1.15 (1.00 to 1.32,\nP=0.06) for stroke, 1.15 (1.04 to 1.27, P=0.008) for the\ncomposite of myocardial infarction or stroke, and 1.04\n(0.95 to 1.13, P=0.4) for death.\nDISCUSSION\nIn theWomen\u2019s Health Initiative Calcium\/Vitamin D\nSupplementation (WHI CaD) Study personal use of\ncalcium supplement at randomisation significantly\ninfluenced the effect of randomisation to calcium and\nvitamin D on the risk of cardiovascular events. In the\nentire WHI cohort, there were significant interactions\nbetween calcium and vitamin D and personal calcium\nsupplement use for myocardial infarction and for\nstroke. In the 46% of the WHI CaD participants who\nwere not taking personal calcium supplements at ran-\ndomisation, the hazard ratios for cardiovascular events\nwith calcium and vitamin D ranged from 1.13 to 1.22.\nBy contrast, in the participants taking personal calcium\nsupplements at randomisation, allocation to calcium\nMyocardial infarction\n  Grant 20058\n  Lappe 20079\n  WHI CaD 2007\nTotal\nTest for heterogeneity: P=0.9, I2=0%\nStroke\n  Grant 20058\n  Lappe 20079\n  WHI CaD 2007\nTotal\nTest for heterogeneity: P=0.9, I2=0%\nMyocardial infarction or stroke\n  Grant 20058\n  Lappe 20079\n  WHI CaD 2007\nTotal\nTest for heterogeneity: P=0.9, I2=0%\n1.21 (1.01 to 1.44)\n1.20 (1.00 to 1.43)\n1.16 (1.02 to 1.32)\n18\n1\n81\n23\n2\n75\n21\n2\n78\nCaD = calcium and vitamin D\n0.5 0.8 1.51 1.2 2 3\nStudy Relative risk\n(95% CI)\nRelative risk\n(95% CI)\n0.04\n0.05\n0.02\nP\nvalue\nWeight\n(%)\nFavours\nCaD\nFavours\nplacebo\nFig 2 | Effect of calcium and vitamin D on cardiovascular events: based on trial-level data from\ntwo randomised, placebo controlled trials of calcium and vitamin D89 and the WHI CaD Study\nparticipants not taking personal calcium supplements at baseline.

In\nwomen not taking personal calcium supplements at\nrandomisation, the hazard ratios for clinical myo-\ncardial infarction (1.22) and stroke (1.17) were similar\nto those observed in our meta-analysis of trials of cal-\ncium monotherapy (1.31 and 1.20, respectively).2\nBy itself, this analysis of the WHI CaD Study data\ndoes not provide definitive evidence of an adverse\neffect of calcium and vitamin D on cardiovascular\nevents. However, when these data are pooledwith pre-\nviously unpublished data from two other placebo con-\ntrolled trials of calcium and vitamin D, there are\nconsistent increases in the risk ofmyocardial infarction\nand stroke that are statistically significant and are of\nsimilar size to the risks observed with calcium supple-\nments used without vitamin D. Further, when the\nresults for calcium and vitamin D are taken together\nwith those from trials of calcium used asmonotherapy,\nthey provide consistent evidence from 13 randomised,\nplacebo controlled trials involving about 29 000 parti-\ncipants with about 1400 incident myocardial infarc-\ntions and strokes that calcium supplements with or\nwithout vitamin D increase the risk of cardiovascular\nevents.\nThe size of this increase is modest, about 25%\u201330%\nformyocardial infarction and15%\u201320% for stroke, but,\nbecause of the widespread use of calcium supplements\neither alone or with vitamin D, even small increases in\ncardiovascular disease incidence may translate to a\nsubstantial population burden of disease, particularly\nin older age groups. Furthermore, comparisons of the\nbenefits of calcium on fracture preventionwith the risk\nof cardiovascular events suggest that the risk to benefit\nprofile is unfavourable: in our analysis, treating 1000\npatients with calciumor calcium and vitaminD for five\nyears would cause an additional six myocardial infarc-\ntions or strokes (number needed to harm of 178) and\nprevent only three fractures (number needed to treat of\n302).\nLimitations of study\nThe current analysis has some limitations.We used the\npublicly accessible, limited access dataset of the WHI\nclinical trials for these analyses, so the analysis is lim-\nited to the information available in this dataset. Several\nvascular end points are potentially evaluable; we pre-\nspecified those which allowed the most accurate com-\nparisons with previous analyses. Subgroup analysis\nraises several issues, including false positive results\nand over-interpretation of findings.20 21 To minimise\nthese risks, we pre-specified the variable of interest\n(personal calcium supplement use) for this analysis\nbefore obtaining the WHI dataset, assessed its effect\nusing interaction tests, and followed recommended\napproaches for subgroup analysis and inter\npretation.21 22 The hypothesis that the use of personal\ncalcium supplements might interact with the calcium\nand vitamin D treatment effect in theWHI CaD Study\nwas based on plausibility from our finding in trials of\ncalcium monotherapy, and deviation from normal\nclinical trial practice (allowing trial participants free\naccess to the intervention being studied) is unusual\nand has the potential to mask both adverse and bene-\nficial effects.\nWe followed the approach of theWHI authors in not\nadjusting P values for multiple subgroup analyses, and\ninstead estimated the likelihood of false positive tests,3\nan approved approach for addressing multiplicity of\nCu\nm\nul\nat\niv\ne \nin\nci\nde\nnc\ne \n(%\n) Myocardial infarction\nHazard ratio 1.26, (95% CI 1.07 to 1.47), P=0.005\n12 526\n12 343\nCalcium\nPlacebo\nNo at risk\n11 822\n11 725\n9377\n9262\n6971\n6855\n2383\n2332\n583\n599\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nCu\nm\nul\nat\niv\ne \nin\nci\nde\nnc\ne \n(%\n) Stroke\nHazard ratio 1.19, (95% CI 1.02 to 1.39), P=0.03\n12 526\n12 343\nCalcium\nPlacebo\nNo at risk\n11 817\n11 720\n9391\n9255\n6982\n6855\n2383\n2319\n585\n596\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nYears\nCu\nm\nul\nat\niv\ne \nin\nci\nde\nnc\ne \n(%\n) Myocardial infarction or stroke\n0 1 2\nHazard ratio 1.17, (95% CI 1.05 to 1.31), P=0.005\n3 4 5 6 7 8 109\n12 526\n12 343\nCalcium\nPlacebo\nNo at risk\n11 746\n11 660\n9281\n9167\n6870\n6761\n2334\n2287\n572\n586\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nCalcium\nPlacebo\nFig 3 | Effect of calcium supplements with or without vitamin D\non cardiovascular events: based on patient-level data.

However, within each subgroup, the\nbaseline characteristics of the participants allocated to\ncalcium and vitamin D seemed well matched to those\nallocated to placebo. In contrast, as expected, women\nusing personal calcium differed fromwomen not using\npersonal calcium in a number of factors that might\ninfluence cardiovascular outcomes. However, the\nWHI investigators have previously reported no signif-\nicant interactions with these factors, calcium and vita-\nminD, and risk of death frommyocardial infarction or\ncoronary heart disease\u2014except for body mass index,\nwith obese women having a lower risk of death from\nmyocardial infarction or coronary heart disease with\ncalcium and vitamin D than non-obese women.4 Obe-\nsity does not explain our findings since it was more\ncommon in women not using personal calcium, and\nwould have tended to obscure an interaction effect.\nIn the WHI CaD participants the incidence of\ncardiovascular events was relatively low, reflecting\nthe comparative youth of the cohort. Thus, despite its\nsize and long duration, theWHI CaD Study had insuf-\nficient power to detect small effect sizes, particularly\nwhen subgroups are considered. For example, in\nwomen not taking personal calcium supplements at\nrandomisation, the study had 80% power to detect a\n33% increase in clinical myocardial infarction.\nThe WHI CaD Study accounts for 75%\u201380% of the\nweighting in the meta-analyses of co-administered cal-\ncium and vitamin D, and 45%\u201355% of the weighting in\nthe meta-analysis of calcium with or without vitamin\nD. However, the results for the individual studies in\nall the meta-analyses are quite consistent and do not\nsuggest an undue influence of a single outlying study\nor WHI CaD.\nInterpretation of results\nFor most of its participants, the WHI CaD Study\nassessed the impact of adding calcium and vitamin D\nto personal calcium supplements, effectively compar-\ning a higher dose of calcium with a lower dose of cal-\ncium. By restricting the analyses to women not taking\npersonal calcium supplements, we were able to esti-\nmate the effect of calcium and vitamin D on cardio-\nvascular events, observing increased risks of these\nevents with calcium and vitamin D. In women taking\npersonal calcium supplements at randomisation, the\naddition of calcium and vitamin D did not increase\ncardiovascular risk, and the risk of cardiovascular\nevents with calcium and vitamin D was also not\naffected by the dose of personal calcium supplements.\nThis suggests that there may not be a dose-response\nrelationship between calcium supplements and the\nrisk of cardiovascular events. Thus, even doses of\n<500 mg\/day might be associated with an increased\nrisk of cardiovascular events similar to doses\n\u22651000 mg\/day. This would be consistent with the\nnotion that the abrupt change in plasma calcium con-\ncentration after supplement ingestion causes the\nadverse effect, rather than it being related to the total\ncalcium load ingested.24 25\nIn the entire WHI cohort there was no significant\ninteraction between calcium and vitamin D, personal\ncalcium supplement use, andmortality\u2014and therefore\nno evidence of a difference in mortality risk with cal-\ncium and vitamin D in the subgroups defined by\nMyocardial infarction\n  Baron 199913\n  Grant 20058\n  Grant 2005 Vit D8\n  Prince 200616\n  Reid 20061 14\n  Lappe 20079\n  WHI CaD 2007\n  Reid 200815\nTotal\nTest for heterogeneity: P>0.9, I2=0%\nStroke\n  Reid 199311 12\n  Baron 199913\n  Grant 20058\n  Grant 2005 Vit D8\n  Prince 200616\n  Reid 20061 14\n  Bonnick 200717\n  Lappe 20079\n  WHI CaD 2007\nTotal\nTest for heterogeneity: P>0.9, I2=0%\nMyocardial infarction or stroke\n  Reid 199311 12\n  Baron 199913\n  Grant 20058\n  Grant 2005 Vit D8\n  Prince 200616\n  Reid 20061 14\n  Bonnick 200717\n  Lappe 20079\n  WHI CaD 2007\n  Reid 200815\nTotal\nTest for heterogeneity: P>0.9, I2=0%\n1.24 (1.07 to 1.45)\n1.15 (1.00 to 1.32)\n1.15 (1.03 to 1.27)\n6\n13\n12\n6\n8\n1\n56\n0.3\n0.3\n3\n14\n16\n11\n8\n0.3\n1.5\n47\n0.2\n4\n14\n14\n8\n7\n0.2\n1\n51\n0.1\n0.5 0.8 1.51 1.2 2 3\nStudy Relative risk\n(95% CI)\nRelative risk\n(95% CI)\n0.004\n0.06\n0.009\nP\nvalue\nWeight\n(%)\nFavours\ncalcium\n(\u00b1 vitamin D)\nFavours\nplacebo\nFig 4 | Effect of calcium supplements with or without vitamin D on cardiovascular events: trial-\nlevel data.

The composite outcome for\nPrince et al16 was myocardial infarction, stroke, or sudden death\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 7 of 9\npersonal calcium use. In women not taking personal\ncalcium supplements, no increase in mortality was\nobserved with calcium and vitamin D despite the\nincreased risk of cardiovascular events. The most\nlikely explanation is that participants in WHI were at\nlow risk of cardiovascular events and death. A 15%\nincrease in myocardial infarction and stroke would\nlead to only a 1%\u20133% increase in total mortality if\n10%\u201320% of the additional events led to death during\nfollow-up. The subgroup analysis did not have suffi-\ncient power to detect such a difference, but the 95%\nconfidence intervals formortality (0.86 to 1.14) encom-\npass an effect of this size.\nIf calcium supplements do increase cardiovascular\nrisk it is important to consider the potential underlying\nmechanisms.25 Calcium supplements acutely increase\nserum calcium concentration by a modest amount,24\nan effect that is sustained during long term treatment,\nas evidenced by lower levels of parathyroid\nhormone.15 Serum calcium concentrations are posi-\ntively associated with carotid artery plaque\nthickness,26 aortic calcification,27 incidence of myo-\ncardial infarction,28-30 and mortality.31 These findings\nare consistent with observational data suggesting\nincreased risk of cardiovascular events and death in\nprimary hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which\nserum calcium concentration is elevated.32 33\nThe process of vascular calcification is a complex,\nregulated process similar to osteogenesis.34 It is possi-\nble that the increase in serum calcium concentrations\nfrom calcium supplements influences vascular calcifi-\ncation by altering regulators of calcification such as\nfetuin A, pyrophosphate, and bone morphogenic pro-\ntein-7, or by directly binding to the calcium-sensing\nreceptor that is expressed on vascular smooth muscle\ncells.25 Exposing cultures of vascular smooth muscle\ncells to increased concentrations of calcium results in\nincreased mineralisation of the cultures.35 Supporting\nthis hypothesis are studies of patients with renal\nimpairment, in whom calcium supplements accelerate\nvascular calcification and increase mortality in both\ndialysis and pre-dialysis populations.36-38\nIt is also possible that calcium supplements\nadversely affect risk of arterial thrombus formation.\nAcute hypercalcaemia in rats increases blood\ncoaguability,39 potentially via an effect on platelets\nsince calcium-sensing receptors are found on these\ncells.40\nTherefore, extracellular calcium concentrations\nmight affect the function of several cells that are impli-\ncated in the pathogenesis of vascular events. All these\npossibilities require further evaluation.\nConclusions\nCalcium and vitaminD supplements increased the risk\nof cardiovascular events in the WHI CaD participants\nwho were not taking personal calcium supplements at\nthe time of randomisation. When these results are\ntaken together with the results of other clinical trials\nof calcium supplements, with or without vitamin D,\nthey strongly suggest that calcium supplements mod-\nestly increase the risk of cardiovascular events, particu-\nlarly myocardial infarction. These data justify a\nreassessment of the use of calcium supplements in\nolder people.\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative is conducted and supported by the\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in collaboration with the\nWHI Study Investigators.
