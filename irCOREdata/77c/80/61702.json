As a corollary, flavonoids are shown to be present in tissues of A. regularis.   \n \nKey words Bryophyte, carotenoids, flavonoids, UV-B screening pigments \n \n  2 \nIntroduction \nHalocarbon release to the atmosphere has caused widespread depletion of stratospheric ozone (O3) since the \nearly 1980s (World Meteorological Organization 1999). Substantial O3 reductions, arising from photochemical \ncatalysis by reactive chlorine and bromine species on the surfaces of polar stratospheric clouds, have been \nrecorded over Antarctica, leading to the annual springtime \u2018ozone hole\u2019\n \n(Farman et al. 1985). Since O3 absorbs \nbiologically damaging solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (280-315 nm), stratospheric O3 depletion leads to \nincreased irradiances of UV-B received at the Earth=s surface\n \n(World Meteorological Organization 1999). \nDuring the past two decades considerable effort has been invested in determining plant response to \nsimulated O3 depletion. The two main experimental approaches used have been to apply supplemental UV-B \nradiation to plants from fluorescent UV lamps or to filter UV-B from solar radiation, typically with plastic \nscreens (Rozema et al. 1999). These artificial exposures have suggested that O3 depletion increases foliar \nconcentrations of UV-B screening pigments, typically flavonoids, but has little effect on the photosynthesis and \ngrowth of many plant species (Caldwell and Flint 1994). However, artificial exposures are often confounded by \nmethodological problems. For example, low irradiances of UV-A (315-400 nm) and PAR (400-700 nm) \nreceived by plants in laboratory or glasshouse exposures elicit anomolously severe responses to UV-B radiation \n(Caldwell and Flint 1994), and screens used in filtration experiments alter several abiotic factors other than \nincident radiation, notably temperature and water availability (Kennedy 1995). \nExperiments in locations experiencing substantial stratospheric O3 depletion are therefore required to \nassess plant response to O3-dependent increases in UV-B radiation. However, other than the data of Rousseaux \net al. (1999) and Newsham et al. (2002), who found that O3 depletion was associated with increased foliar DNA \ndamage in a South American herb and concentrations of foliar pigments in an Antarctic liverwort and a moss, no \ndata exist on how O3 depletion per se influences terrestrial plants. In the light of this, a study was carried out on \nthe Antarctic Peninsula in late austral spring and early summer to examine whether or not the pigmentation of a \nbryophyte, Andreaea regularis, was associated with changes to the radiative environment arising from O3 \ndepletion. Substantial depletion of O3 occurs in the stratosphere over the Antarctic Peninsula in austral spring \nand summer, coinciding with the emergence of plants from melting snow and ice, resulting in wide variation in \nthe level of solar UV-B received by vegetation. In addition, because it is uncertain whether or not flavonoids are \npresent in the Andreaeales (Rozema et al. 1999), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to \ntest for the presence of these pigments in A. regularis tissues. \n  3 \nMaterials and methods \nIrradiance and O3 column measurements \nGlobal spectral irradiance (280-600 nm, step 0.5 nm) was recorded between 16 November and 28 December \n1998 by a double monochromator grating spectroradiometer (Bentham DM150; Bentham Instruments Ltd., \nReading, UK) situated in a laboratory at Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, western Antarctic Peninsula (67\u00b0 34' S, \n68\u00b0 07' W). The instrument recorded data every 30 min between 08:00 and 19:00 hrs local time. The \nspectroradiometer was calibrated against a 1000 W quartz-halogen tungsten coil filament lamp which had been \ncalibrated relative to National Institute of Standards and Technology standards. Data from the instrument were \nnot available for 25 and 26 November 1998. Spectral data were either expressed as the irradiance (in W m\n-2\n) of \nunweighted UV-B, UV-A or PAR, the irradiance of biologically effective UV-B weighted with the generalized \nplant action spectrum normalized at 300 nm (UV-BBE; Caldwell 1971), or the ratio of UV-B to PAR irradiance \n(hereafter FUV-B\/FPAR). Noon values of each parameter were calculated. Integration was also used to calculate daily \ndoses (in kJ m\n-2\n) of UV-BBE, or unweighted UV-B, UV-A and PAR, from irradiance data. Daily mean FUV-B\/FPAR \nvalues were also calculated. \nOverpass measurements of O3 column depth (in Dobson Units, DU) over Rothera Point were obtained \nfor between 16 November and 12 December 1998 from the Earth Probe Total O3 Mapping Spectrometer (EP-\nTOMS) through the world wide web (http:\/\/jwocky.gsfc.nasa.gov). Data from the spectrometer were not \navailable for 17 November and 13 to 28 December 1998. \n \nSampling and spectrophotometric measurements \nPlants of Andreaea regularis C. Muell. were sampled daily at solar noon (13:30 hrs local time) between 16 \nNovember and 28 December 1998 from a gully fed by meltwater at Rothera Point situated c. 500 m from the \nlaboratory in which the spectroradiometer was located. A single colony (c. 25 x 25 mm) was excised with a \nscalpel each day and was placed in a clean polythene bag. There was insufficient plant material available to take \nreplicate samples on each day. \nIn the laboratory, the uppermost 2-3 mm of foliage was cut from the colony and, to facilitate grinding, \nwas blotted on absorbent paper until no free water could be drawn from the tissues (Post and Vesk 1992). \nPreliminary analyses, using the spectrophotometric methods described below, indicated that this process \nremoved c. 2% of the pigments analysed for in this study from tissues. Each sample was then divided into three \n  4 \n100 mg subsamples. Two of the subsamples were ground separately with c. 1.5 g of silver sand in a mortar with \na pestle for 0.5 min. To extract chlorophylls and carotenoids, 3 ml of methanol was added to the first subsample \nand the tissues were ground for 1 min. The extracts were then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 0\u00b0C and 700 \nl of these extracts were passed through 0.45 m filters (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK). To \nextract UV-B screening pigments, 3 ml of a 70:20:1 mixture of methanol, water and HCl was added to the \nsecond subsample and the tissues were ground for 1 min. The extracts were heated at 65 C for 10 min and were \nthen centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants removed and placed in a refrigerator, and a further 1 \nml of the methanol, water and HCl mixture was added to the pellet, which was resuspended before heating again \nat 65\u00b0C for 10 min (Post and Vesk 1992). The supernatants were combined and 700 l of the extracts passed \nthrough 0.45 m filters. The third subsample was dried to constant weight (60\u00b0C for 48 h) to enable pigment \ndata to be expressed on a per g dry weight basis. \nExtracts were transferred to UV grade polymethyl methacrylate semi-microcuvettes (PMMA; Kartell \nspa, Milan, Italy), diluted and absorbances were measured immediately in a spectrophotometer. To estimate \nconcentrations of chlorophylls a and b and total carotenoids, absorbances of methanol extracts were measured at \n470, 653 and 666 nm and concentrations of pigments calculated from standard formulae (Lichtenthaler and \nWellburn 1983). Weights of chlorophylls and carotenoids extracted per g dry weight of tissue were subsequently \ncalculated. To estimate concentrations of UV-B screening pigments, the absorbance of each acidified methanol \nextract was measured between 280 and 315 nm (step 1 nm). Concentrations of UV-B screening pigments were \nexpressed in arbitary units as the area under the absorbance curve (AUC280-315) per g dry weight of tissue. \nSample preparation and analyses were conducted in dim light and were usually completed within 2 h of excision. \n \nHPLC analyses \nHPLC was used to test for the presence of flavonoids in A. regularis tissues. Plants collected at Rothera Point \nwere frozen at -80\u00b0C and transported to the UK for analysis. Tissues (400 mg) were ground in liquid nitrogen \nand 1 ml of a 50:49:1 mixture of methanol, water and HCl was added. The extracts were shaken in the dark \novernight and injected directly onto a Prodigy ODS-3 column with a particle size of 5 \u00b5m (Phenomonex, \nCheshire, UK). Flavonoids were separated by reversed phase HPLC at 30\u00b0C and a flow rate of 1.5 ml min\n-1\n. The \nmobile gradients were solvents A (50 mM ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate, pH 2.5) and B (acetonitrile) \n  5 \nusing the protocol described by Lunte (1987). Reagents were filtered (0.2 \u00b5m) and degassed with helium. Water \nwas purified using a Millipore milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Spectral scans between 254 and \n525 nm were obtained for all pigments eluted on the column by a diode array detector (Kontron Instruments \nLtd., Watford, UK). \n \nResults \nO3 column and radiative environment \nData from the EP-TOMS indicated that there was wide variation in O3 column depth over Rothera Point during \nthe period of study (Fig. 1). Taking a maximum O3 column depth of 370 DU, recorded on 19 November, a 47% \nreduction of O3 occurred on 3 December, when a column depth of 197 DU was recorded over the study site. \nLinear regression, using O3 column depth as a predictor variable, and the calculated irradiance parameters as \nresponses, indicated that there were no significant (P<0.05) associations between O3 column depth and the \nirradiances or daily doses of UV-A or PAR received at ground level. However, strong inverse associations \nbetween O3 column depth and daily mean and noon FUV-B\/FPAR  were recorded (Fig. 1, inset; Table 1). Significant \nassociations were also recorded between O3 column depth and the irradiances and daily doses of unweighted \nUV-B and UV-BBE radiation (Table 1).  \n \nPlant pigmentation \nLinear regression analyses indicated that none of the O3-dependent irradiance parameters shown in Table 1 were \nsignificant predictors for concentrations of chlorophylls a and b or total chlorophyll (regression summary; r\n2\n = \n0.1 - 7%, all P>0.05). However, linear regression indicated that concentrations of UV-B screening pigments \nwere associated with O3-dependent irradiance parameters. Concentrations of UV-B screening pigments were \npositively associated with increasing daily mean FUV-B\/FPAR (Fig. 2a) and were also positively associated with \nnoon FUV-B\/FPAR, noon irradiance of UV-BBE and daily doses of UV-B and UV-BBE (Table 2). Daily mean FUV-B\/FPAR \nwas the most significant predictor for concentrations of UV-B screening pigments. Regression analyses indicated \nthat concentrations of total carotenoids were positively associated with noon and daily mean FUV-B\/FPAR (Fig. 2b;  \nTable 2) and that noon FUV-B\/FPAR was the most significant predictor for carotenoid concentrations. \nFour peaks were observed on HPLC chromatograms. The strongest peak had an absorption maximum at \n256 nm and eluted at 37.8 min. The minor peaks had absorption maxima at 259, 263 and 260 nm, and eluted at \n  6 \n38.1, 39.0 and 39.6 min, respectively. Subsidiary absorption maxima were not observed for any of the peaks.  \n \nDiscussion \nThe present study took place in an environment with no tropospheric O3 pollution. Therefore all variation in O3 \ncolumn depth over the study site will have taken place in the stratosphere as a result of O3 depletion. The study \ntherefore suggests that A. regularis responded to changes in UV-B radiation arising from stratospheric O3 \ndepletion by increasing the synthesis of UV-B screening pigments and carotenoids in foliage. This broadly \ncorroborates conclusions from current research into the predicted effects of O3 depletion on plant pigmentation. \nIn a meta-analysis of plant responses to elevated UV-B radiation in 62 outdoor irradiation studies, Searles et al. \n(2001) found that the accumulation of foliar UV-B screening pigments was the most consistent response of \nplants to simulated O3 depletion. In addition, Antarctic field experiments have shown increased concentrations of \nUV-B screening pigments in foliage of the pearlwort Colobanthus quitensis and the grass Deschampsia \nantarctica exposed for four months to near-ambient solar UV-B radiation under plastic screens on the western \nAntarctic Peninsula, compared with plants exposed to reduced UV-B radiation (Ruhland and Day 2000; Xiong \nand Day 2001). The widespread accumulation of UV-B screening pigments in plant tissues in response to UV-B \nradiation is owing at least in part to flavonoid synthesis, caused by the induction of genes encoding chalcone \nsynthase, a key enzyme in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (Jordan et al. 1994). At least some of the UV-B \nscreening pigments in A. regularis foliage appear to have been flavonoids: the absorption maxima of peaks \nobtained on HPLC chromatograms and the absence of subsidiary maxima indicate that they were most probably \nflavones or biflavonyls (Harborne 1973). \nCarotenoid synthesis is similarly known to be induced by exposure to UV-B radiation (Cockell and \nKnowland 1999). The data from the present study indicate that carotenoid concentration in A. regularis foliage \nwas positively associated with increases in UV-B radiation arising from O3 depletion, corroborating the data of \nXiong and Day (2001), who showed increased concentrations of these pigments in foliage of C. quitensis and D. \nantarctica plants exposed to near-ambient solar UV-B, compared with plants exposed to reduced UV-B. \nSimilarly, increased carotenoid concentrations have been found in foliage of the bryophytes Cephaloziella \nexiliflora and Sanionia uncinata at Rothera Point during periods of O3 depletion (Newsham et al. 2002). \nHowever, no effect of elevated UV-B radiation was found on the concentrations of foliar carotenoids in the \nmeta-analysis of Searles et al. (2001). \n  7 \nThe depth of O3 column above Rothera Point in the present study varied widely between days. \nTherefore the time taken for pigments in A. regularis tissues to respond to changes in the radiative environment \narising from O3 depletion would have been rapid, and probably < 24 h, as has been shown for two other plant \nspecies (Newsham et al. 2002). That an Antarctic bryophyte responds rapidly to O3 depletion is perhaps \nsurprising, given the temperature dependence of reactions in biosynthetic pathways, but the temperatures of \nAntarctic bryophyte colonies reach 20\u00b0C during cloudless periods (Newsham et al. 2002), which would enable \nrapid plant response to O3 depletion. The present data corroborate those from studies showing diurnal variations \nin foliar concentrations of carotenoids and flavonoids in alpine plant species in the natural environment (Veit et \nal. 1996; Wildi and L\u00fctz 1996), and studies indicating that flavonoid production is induced within several hours \nof exposure to UV-B radiation (Jordan et al. 1994). \nThe present study suggests that chlorophyll concentration in A. regularis foliage was unaffected by UV-\nB radiation arising from O3 depletion. Similarly, Searles et al. (2001) concluded from their meta-analysis that \nsimulated O3 depletion has no effect on concentrations of chlorophylls in plant tissues. Altering incident UV-B \nradiation also has no effect on the concentrations of these pigments in C. quitensis foliage, but foliar chlorophyll \nconcentrations in D. antarctica plants exposed to near-ambient UV-B are higher than in plants exposed to \nreduced ambient UV-B (Xiong and Day 2001). These findings, together with the apparent paucity of effect of \nelevated UV-B radiation on the maximum quantum yield of photochemistry of a wide range of plant species \n(Allen et al. 1998; Searles et al. 2001; Xiong and Day 2001; Newsham et al. 2002), indicate that the \nphotosynthetic capacity of plants is unlikely to be diminished by even severe episodes of O3 depletion in the \nnatural environment. \nThe data from the present study indicate that the pigmentation of A. regularis is significantly associated \nwith the ratio of incident UV-B to PAR irradiance. It is widely acknowledged that this parameter is an important \ndeterminant of plant response to simulated O3 depletion (Caldwell and Flint 1994; Allen et al. 1998), possibly \nowing to modulation of gene expression in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway induced by UV-B radiation and \nblue light (Ohl et al. 1989). Results from outdoor irradiation studies similarly indicate that the ratio of UV-B to \nPAR irradiance directly influences plant response in the field: Caldwell et al. (1994) found that plant growth \nresponded most severely to elevated UV-B simulating a 36% reduction in O3 column only when UV-A and PAR \nwere reduced to 50% of their fluxes in solar radiation. The present data also in part corroborate the results of \nCaldwell et al. (1994), who found that the highest concentrations of UV-B screening pigments extracted per unit \n  8 \nleaf mass were from plants exposed to elevated UV-B radiation and reduced UV-A and PAR. \nThe influence of carotenoids and UV-B screening pigments on the physiology of A. regularis during \nperiods of O3 depletion is at present unclear. Carotenoids, particularly those involved in photosynthesis and \nphotochemical quenching, are not thought to offer substantial protection from UV-B radiation, owing to the \nlarge number of carbon double bonds in these linear molecules, which tend to increase absorption in the visible \nportion of the spectrum (Cockell and Knowland 1999). However, UV-B screening pigments, and flavonoids in \nparticular, efficiently absorb UV-B owing to the presence of carbon ring structures, and may hence offer \nsignificant protection to plants from UV-B radiation (Cockell and Knowland 1999). Future research is required \nto determine the possible benefits of carotenoids and UV-B screening pigments to A. regularis during periods of \nO3 depletion, for example in conferring protection on photosystem II, as has been shown for other Antarctic \nplant species (Newsham et al. 2002). \n \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council.
