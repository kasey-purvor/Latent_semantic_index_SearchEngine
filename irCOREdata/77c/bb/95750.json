It is seen as central to \nthe development efforts of countries as far afield as Chile, China, Guatemala and Nepal.  \nAnd in the multiple guises of subsidiarity, devolution and federalism it is also squarely in \nthe foreground of policy discourse in the EU, UK and US.  But surprisingly, there is little \nagreement in the empirical literature on the effects of decentralization on a number of \nimportant policy goals.  Advocates (e.g. Olowu and Wunsch 1990, Putnam 1993, World \nBank 1994, UNDP 1993) argue that decentralization can make government more \nresponsive to the governed by \u201ctailoring levels of consumption to the preferences of \nsmaller, more homogeneous groups\u201d (Wallis and Oates 1988, 5).  Critics (e.g. Crook and \nSverrisson 1999, Prud\u2019homme 1995, Samoff 1990, Smith 1985, Tanzi 1995) dispute this, \narguing that local governments are too susceptible to elite capture, too lacking in \ntechnical, human and financial resources, and too corrupt to produce a heterogeneous \nrange of public services that respond efficiently to local demand.  And their profligacy is \nlikely to endanger macroeconomic stability.  But neither side is able to substantiate its \narguments convincingly with empirical evidence. \n Much of the debate has taken place in these pages, similarly without resolution.  \nOf 24 articles on decentralization, local government and responsiveness published in \nWorld Development since 1997, 11 report broadly positive results, and 13 are negative.  \nFiszbein (1997), Shankar and Shah (2003), de Oliveira (2002) and Parry (1997) are \namongst the most enthusiastic, finding that decentralization can spur capacity building in \nlocal government (Colombia), decrease levels of regional inequality through political \n 1\ncompetition (a sample of 26 countries), boost the creation and administration of protected \nareas (Bahia, Brazil), and improve educational outcomes (Chile), respectively.  Rowland \n(2001) and Blair (2000) find that decentralization improved the quality of democratic \ngovernance achieved in both large cities and small towns.  And Petro (2001) finds that \nlocal government played a pivotal role in raising levels of social capital in Novgorod, \nRussia by establishing common social values and priorities for the community.  Other \nauthors, such as Andersson (2004), Larson (2002), McCarthy (2004) and Nygren (2005), \nare more cautious, arguing broadly that decentralization is a complex, problematic \nphenomenon, but may ultimately have positive effects on local welfare. \n Amongst skeptics, some of the most striking are Ellis, Kutengule and Nyasulu \n(2003), Ellis and Mdoe (2003) and Ellis and Bahiigwa (2003), who find that \ndecentralization will likely depress growth and rural livelihoods by facilitating the \ncreation of new business licenses and taxes that stifle private enterprise (Malawi), and \npropagate rent-seeking behavior down to the district and lower levels, so becoming \u201cpart \nof the problem of rural poverty, not part of the solution\u201d1 (Tanzania and Uganda), \nrespectively.  Similarly, Bahiigwa, Rigby and Woodhouse (2005) and Francis and James \n(2003) show that decentralization in Uganda has not led to independent, accountable \nlocal governments, but rather to their capture by local elites, and hence to the failure of \ndecentralization as a tool for poverty reduction.  Porter (2002) agrees for Sub-Saharan \nAfrica more generally.  Regarding the environment, Woodhouse (2003) predicts that \ndecentralization will fail to improve access of the poor to natural resources, or reduce \necological damage.  Casson and Obidzinski (2002) go further, reporting that \ndecentralization in Indonesia has spurred depredatory logging by creating bureaucratic \n 2\nactors with a stake in its proliferation.  The cross-country evidence of Martinez-Vazquez \nand McNab (2003) is similarly unhopeful, showing that we don\u2019t know empirically \nwhether decentralization affects growth directly or indirectly, and have no clear \ntheoretical grounds for predicting a relationship either way.  Worse, de Mello\u2019s (2000) \nstudy of 30 countries predicts that failures of intergovernmental fiscal coordination will \nlead to chronic deficits and, eventually, macroeconomic instability.  The papers of Sundar \n(2001), Thun (2004) and Wiggins, Marfo and Anchirinah (2004) offer more cautious, \nnuanced arguments, that are on the whole skeptical about the possibility of beneficial \nchange through decentralization. \n The larger literature is similarly inconclusive.  Amongst studies of Latin America, \nCampbell (2001) highlights the extraordinary scope of authority and resources that have \nbeen decentralized throughout the region, and argues that this \u201cquiet revolution\u201d has \ngenerated a new model of governance based on innovative, capable leadership, high \npopular participation, and a new implicit contract governing local taxation.  But Montero \nand Samuels (2004) argue that the political motives of reformers often combine with ex-\npost vertical imbalances to make decentralization bad in terms of elite capture, regional \ninequality and macroeconomic stability.  Rodr\u00edguez-Pos\u00e9 and Gill (2004) elaborate \nfurther on the tension between inequality and stability for the case of Brazil, while \nEskeland and Filmer (2002) find econometric evidence that decentralization did lead to \nimprovements in Argentine educational achievement scores. \nAmongst the broadest international surveys: Rondinelli, Cheema and Nellis \n(1983) note that decentralization has seldom, if ever, lived up to expectations.  Most \ndeveloping countries implementing decentralization experienced serious administrative \n 3\nproblems.  Although few comprehensive evaluations of the benefits and costs of \ndecentralization efforts have been conducted, those that were attempted indicate limited \nsuccess in some countries but not others.  A decade and a half later, surveys by Piriou-\nSall (1998), Manor (1999) and Smoke (2001) are slightly more positive, but with caveats \nabout the strength of the evidence in decentralization\u2019s favor.  Manor ends his study with \nthe judgment that \u201cwhile decentralization \u2026is no panacea, it has many virtues and is \nworth pursuing\u201d, after noting that the evidence, though extensive, is still incomplete.  \nSmoke finds the evidence mixed and anecdotal, and asks whether there is empirical \njustification for pursuing decentralization at all.  More recently, in a review of 56 studies \npublished since the late-1990s, Shah, Thompson and Zou (2004) find evidence that \ndecentralization has in some cases improved, and in others worsened, service delivery, \ncorruption, macroeconomic stability, and growth across a large range of countries.  The \nlack of progress is striking. \nThis paper examines decentralization\u2019s effects on educational outcomes in Bolivia \nand Colombia.  We first examine how decentralization changed investment flows across \nsectors, and across space, in both countries.  We then focus much more closely on \neducation.  Our analysis is unusual in that it uses large-N, quantitative evidence to \nexplore the link between decentralization and a specific policy outcome (in this case \nenrollment rates).  Most of the literature focusing on such links uses qualitative data (e.g. \nlegal and regulatory information; see Parry 1997) or small-N empirics (e.g. case studies; \nsee Manor 1999).  To our knowledge, this is the first study that links decentralization \nwith school enrollments using nationwide data.  We provide evidence for such a link for \nColombia, and get as close as the data allow for Bolivia. \n 4\nWhy focus on these two countries in particular?  There are four reasons: (i) in \nboth cases, decentralization was advocated as a remedy for a state whose \nunresponsiveness to citizens\u2019 needs fed serious internal tensions, including armed \ninsurgency in Colombia; (ii) in both cases, decentralizing reforms were pursued in a \nvigorous and sustained manner; (iii) the broad geographic, institutional and historical \nsimilarities these countries share limit problems of data comparability and interpretation; \nand (iv) although their internal ructions have attracted much international attention \nrecently, both are relatively underrepresented in the literature.  Bolivia is particularly \ndeserving of study because reform there consisted of a large change in policy at a discrete \npoint in time, thus rendering it a sort of natural experiment.  Colombia is more relevant \nfor many middle-income countries because of its greater wealth, level of development, \nand relatively high state capacity.  And its more complex, multifaceted reform process is \nmore typical of decentralizations around the world.  To our knowledge, this is the first \ncomparative study of decentralization in Bolivia and Colombia. \n Decentralization is henceforth defined as the devolution by central (i.e. national) \ngovernment of specific functions, with all of the administrative, political and economic \nattributes that these entail, to democratic local (i.e. municipal) governments which are \nindependent of the center within a legally delimited geographic and functional domain.  \nWe mostly ignore intermediate levels of government (departments) for two reasons: (i) \nBolivia decentralized directly to municipalities, by-passing departments entirely at first, \nand only recently making prefects elected; Colombia did not, but focusing on \nmunicipalities facilitates the country comparison.  And (ii) the simplicity of the definition \nthus facilitated aids analytical clarity. \n 5\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 reviews the Bolivian and \nColombian decentralization programs, focusing on their legal and budgetary aspects.  \nSection 3 examines decentralization\u2019s effects on public investment flows in both \ncountries.  Section 4 presents our quantitative methodology.  Section 5 examines whether \ndecentralization made education investment more responsive to local needs in Bolivia, \nand whether it increased school enrollment in Colombia, with detailed econometric \nevidence.  And section 6 concludes. \n2. THE BOLIVIAN AND COLOMBIAN DECENTRALIZATION PROGRAMS \n(a) Popular participation in Bolivia \n On the eve of revolution, Bolivia was a poor, semi-feudal country with extreme \nlevels of inequality, presided over by a \u201ctypical racist state in which the non-Spanish \nspeaking indigenous peasantry was controlled by a small, Spanish speaking white elite, \n[their power] based ultimately on violence more than consensus or any social pact\u201d \n(Klein 1993, 237; our translation).  The nationalist revolution of 1952, which \nexpropriated the \u201ccommanding heights\u201d of the economy, land and mines, launched \nBolivia on the road to one of the most centralized state structures in the region.  The \ngovernment embarked upon a state-led modernization strategy in which public \ncorporations and regional governments initiated a concerted drive to break down \nprovincial fiefdoms, transform existing social relations, and create a modern, industrial, \negalitarian society (Dunkerley 1984).  To this end the President directly appointed \nPrefects, who in turn designated entire regional governments and associated \ndependencies, forming a national chain of cascading authority emanating from the \nPalacio Quemado in La Paz.  \n 6\n The intellectual trends of the 1950s-1970s \u2013 Dependency theory, Import \nSubstitution Industrialization, and Developmentalism \u2013 contributed to the centralizing \ntendency, as did the military governments which overthrew elected administrations with \nincreasing frequency from the 1960s on (Klein 1993).  With political power so little \ndispersed, there was little point in establishing the legal and political instruments of local \ngovernance.  As a result, beyond the nine regional capitals (including La Paz) and an \nadditional 25-30 cities, local government existed in Bolivia at best in name, as an \nhonorary and ceremonial institution devoid of administrative capability and starved for \nfunds.  And in most of the country it did not exist at all. \n Although the 1994 reform was sprung on an unsuspecting nation, the concept of \ndecentralization was by no means new.  For more than 30 years a decentralization debate \nfocused on Bolivia\u2019s nine departments ebbed and flowed politically \u2013 at times taking on \nburning importance, other times all but forgotten.  The issue became caught up in the \ncountry\u2019s centrifugal tensions, as regional elites in Santa Cruz and Tarija consciously \nmanipulated the threat of secession to Brazil and Argentina respectively \u2013 with which \neach is economically more integrated than La Paz \u2013 to extract resources from the center.  \nThe Bolivian paradox of a highly centralized but weak state, and a socially diverse \npopulation with weak national identity, meant that such threats were taken seriously by \nthe political class, which blocked all moves to devolve more power and authority to \nBolivia\u2019s regions. \nSo what spurred the change of tack? and why then?  Two factors stand out.  The \nless important one arises from Bolivia\u2019s failure to achieve sustained, healthy growth \ndespite wrenching economic reform overseen by the IMF and World Bank.  Fifteen years \n 7\nof near-zero per capita economic growth sapped the credibility of the state and fomented \nsocial unrest.  The new Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR) administration \nof Pres. S\u00e1nchez de Lozada saw the structure of government itself as an impediment to \ngrowth.  Decentralization was an attempt to deepen structural reform in order to make the \nstate more efficient and responsive to the population, and so regain its legitimacy in the \nvoters\u2019 eyes. \nThe more important factor arises from the rise of ethnically-based, populist \npolitics in the 1980s, which undercut the MNR\u2019s traditional dominance of the rural vote, \nand posed a serious challenge to its (self-declared) role as the \u201cnatural party of \ngovernment\u201d.  This rural dominance was itself born out of the MNR\u2019s agrarian reforms of \nthe 1952-3 revolution.  Hence a party with a tradition of radical reform, which found \nitself in secular decline, sought a second, re-defining moment.  In a typically bold move, \nit sought to reorganize government, re-cast the relationship between citizens and the state, \nand so win back the loyalty of Bolivians living outside major cities.  To a very important \nextent, decentralization was a gambit to capture rural voters for at least another \ngeneration.2\n Against this background, the Bolivian decentralization reform was announced in \n1994.  The Law of Popular Participation, developed almost in secret by a small number \nof technocrats (Tuchschneider 1997), was announced to the nation to general surprise, \nthen ridicule, then determined opposition from large parts of society.3  It is notable that \nopposition to the law, which was fierce for a few months, came principally from the \nteachers\u2019 union, NGOs and other social actors, and not from political parties.  Judged by \ntheir public declarations, this opposition was an incoherent mix of accusations and fears \n 8\nthat denoted a deep suspicion of the government\u2019s motives, and not a careful reading of \nthe law.  The lack of opposition from parties can largely be attributed to the sweeping \nreforms that were being enacted by the MNR government at the same time as \ndecentralization.  With privatization of the main state enterprises, education reform, and a \ncomprehensive restructuring of the executive branch all being pushed at once, \ndecentralization was relegated to the second tier of political parties\u2019 concerns.  The \nopposition focused its attention elsewhere, and it never became a fighting point. \nFirst made public in January of that year, the law was promulgated by Congress in \nApril and implemented from July.  The scale of the change in resource flows and political \npower that it brought about were enormous.  The core of the law consists of four points \n(Secretar\u00eda Nacional de Participaci\u00f3n Popular, 1994): \n1. Resource Allocation.  Funds devolved to municipalities doubled to 20 percent of all \nnational tax revenue.  More importantly, allocation amongst municipalities switched \nfrom unsystematic, highly political criteria to a strict per capita basis. \n2. Responsibility for Public Services.  Ownership of local infrastructure in education, \nhealth, irrigation, roads, sports and culture was given to municipalities, with the \nconcomitant responsibility to maintain, equip and administer these facilities, and \ninvest in new ones. \n3. Oversight Committees (Comit\u00e9s de Vigilancia) were established to provide an \nalternative channel for representing popular demand in the policy-making process. \nComposed of representatives from local, grass-roots groups, these bodies propose \nprojects and oversee municipal expenditure.  Their ability to have disbursements of \n 9\nPopular Participation funds suspended if they find funds are being misused or stolen \ncan paralyze local government, and gives them real power. \n4. Municipalization.  Existing municipalities were expanded to include suburbs and \nsurrounding rural areas, and 198 new municipalities (out of some 315 in all) were \ncreated. \nThis was followed by the Law of Decentralized Administration (1995) and the Law of \nMunicipalities (1999), which  further defined the municipal mandate and located it in a \nbroader governmental architecture. \n The change in local affairs that these measures catalyzed is immense.  Before \nreform local government was absent throughout the vast majority of Bolivian territory, \nand the broader state present at most in the form of a military garrison, schoolhouse or \nhealth post, each reporting to its respective ministry.  After reform, elected local \ngovernments sprouted throughout the land.  This is reflected in resources flows between \ncenter and periphery.  Before decentralization Bolivia\u2019s three main cities took 86% of all \ndevolved funds, while the remaining 308 municipalities divided amongst them a mere \n14%.  After decentralization the shares reversed to 27% and 73% respectively.  The per \ncapita criterion resulted in a massive shift of resources to previously neglected areas.  \nAmongst smaller, poorer rural districts, resource increases of 50,000 \u2013 100,000 percent \nwere quite common. \n(b) The decentralization process in Colombia \nLike Bolivia, Colombia was traditionally a highly centralized country, with \nmayors and governors directly named by central government.  Governors, in particular, \nwere the President\u2019s hombres de confianza, and carried out his will in the regions.  But \n 10\nunlike Bolivia\u2019s \u201cbig bang\u201d reform, decentralization in Colombia developed over years as \na much more gradual, incremental process.  Ceballos and Hoyos (2004) identify three \nbroad phases: \nPhase 1 began in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and included a number of fiscal \nmeasures aimed at strengthening municipal finances.  Most important of these were Law \n14 of 1983 and Law 12 of 1986, which assigned to municipalities increased powers of tax \ncollection, including especially sales tax, and established parameters for the investment \nof these funds. \nPhase 2, which began in the mid-1980s, was more concerned with political and \nadministrative matters.  Amongst the most important of these measures was Law 11 of \n1986, which regulated the popular election of mayors and sought to promote popular \nparticipation in local public decision-making via Juntas Administradoras Locales, \namongst others.  Reforms enshrined in the 1991 constitution, such as citizens\u2019 initiatives, \nmunicipal planning councils, open town meetings, the ability to revoke mayoral \nmandates, referenda, and popular consultations, further deepened political \ndecentralization.  The 1991 constitution also established the popular election of \ngovernors. \nPhase 3 consisted of a number of laws that regulated the new constitution, and \nother fiscal and administrative reforms of the period  These laws assigned greater \nresponsibility to municipalities for the provision of public services and social investment, \nand provided additional resources for the same by increasing central government \ntransfers to local governments significantly.  The laws mandate that the bulk of \ntransferred funds should be spent on education and health, with little discretion left to \n 11\nlocal governments.  Automatic transfers to regional governments rose from about 20% to \nover 40% of total government spending, placing Colombia first in the region amongst \ncountries with a unitary state, and third overall behind the two big federal countries, \nBrazil and Argentina (Alesina et al., 2000). \nThe aggregate effect of two decades of political and fiscal reforms was a large \nincrease in the authority and operational independence of Colombia\u2019s municipal \ngovernments, accompanied by a huge rise in the resources they controlled.  \nMunicipalities were allowed to raise and spend significant sums of taxes, central-to-local \ngovernment transfers increase more than three fold,4 and municipal governments were \npermitted to issue public debt.  Overall municipal expenditures and investments rose \nfrom 2.8% to 8.3% of GDP, as detailed in figure 1.  This rise was due entirely to \nincreased investment, while running costs remained stable over the period.5\nFigure 1 \n0.00%\n1.00%\n2.00%\n3.00%\n4.00%\n5.00%\n6.00%\n7.00%\n1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002\nMunicipal Expenditures & Investment (%GDP)\nInvestment Running Costs\n \nSource: National Planning Department; original calculations. \n What drove decentralization in Colombia?  As befits a much longer and more \nelaborate process, we cannot limit the motivating factors of reform to a few discrete \ngoals.  Ceballos and Hoyos group the many reasons into two categories.  The first of \n 12\nthese is the challenge of political instability.  Colombia is a violent country \u2013 much more \nso than Bolivia \u2013 with a long history of civil conflict, armed rebellion, persistently high \nlevels of \u201ccommon\u201d crime, and the use of violence as an explicit tool of political \nmobilization.  The late 1970s saw levels of violence rise again as the internal conflict \nintensified.  At the same time, social protests and pressures from regional groups \nmultiplied, linked to the central state\u2019s inability to meet demands for social services and \npublic investment.  Secondly, the political hegemony over the instruments of the state of \nthe traditional Liberal and Conservative parties began to be seen more and more as a \nliability \u2013 less the solution to a previous round of civil violence (La Violencia) and more \na cause of the next one.  Colombians from across the political spectrum became \nconvinced that the inability of the state to respond to society\u2019s demands \u2013 and its outright \nabsence in many areas (the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d), combined with the waning legitimacy of \nan arbitrarily restricted democracy,6 were leading to public sector inefficiencies, civic \ndiscontent, and ultimately armed violence. \n Thus from the start decentralization in Colombia was a multi-faceted tool \ndesigned to serve a combination of purposes particular to Colombia\u2019s troubled \ndemocracy.  Through it, policy elites sought to increase the levels of electoral and citizen \nparticipation within the existing institutional framework.  They sought to open the \npolitical system via popular elections at the regional and local levels, where they hoped \nnew political movements would eventually break the liberal-conservative hegemony over \nthe resources of the state.  In Colombia\u2019s largest cities this has indeed been the case; \nelsewhere evidence is mixed (see Ceballos and Hoyos 2004). \n 13\n3. DID DECENTRALIZATION CHANGE PUBLIC INVESTMENT?  \nDESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS \n(a) Data \nWe analyze databases compiled for each country from official government \nstatistics.  Bolivian data comes from the National Electoral Court, National Institute of \nStatistics, National Secretariat of Popular Participation, National Secretariat of Public \nInvestment and External Finance, and the Social Policy Analysis Unit.  Colombian data \ncomes from the Agust\u00edn Codazzi Geography Institute, National Electoral Office, National \nPlanning Department, Office of the Vice Presidency, and the National Administrative \nDepartment of Statistics. \nOur databases cover over 90% of Colombian municipalities and the universe of \nBolivian municipalities.  Within the Latin American context, Colombian municipal data \nare relatively abundant and detailed.7  Compiling that database was thus relatively \nstraightforward.  But the same was not true for Bolivia.  Before 1994, the vast majority of \npublic investment in Bolivian villages and towns was undertaken by central government.  \nBut financial records of these projects \u2013 voluminous and very detailed \u2013 do not include \ninformation on which municipality they (would eventually) belong to.  This is not \nsurprising, as most municipalities did not exist even in law.  Hence local experts in \ngeographic information systems were engaged to allocate the thousands of public \ninvestment projects in the 1987-1993 Public Sector Investment Budget to Bolivia\u2019s \nmunicipalities, as created or expanded in the 1994 reform.  This data was combined with \npost-reform data reported by municipal governments to create our 1987-1996 municipal \ninvestment dataset. \n 14\nFor both Bolivia and Colombia, all information on budgets and financial flows is \npanel data.  Electoral data is periodic and cross-sectional.  All other data (e.g. social, \ndemographic, institutional, infrastructural) is cross-sectional, from national censuses and \nother national surveys, such as the Bolivian \u201cmunicipal census\u201d, a special exercise that \ninventoried municipalities\u2019 physical and institutional infrastructures.  Our database \nretains data integrity by source8.  We use similar variables from different sources in as \nchecks on each other, in alternative specifications of the models presented in section 4.  \nOur models prove robust to such tests. \n(b) Bolivia \n The extent of the change decentralization brought about in Bolivia is perhaps best \nappreciated by examining how it changed the composition of municipal public \ninvestment.  Figure 2 compares investment by sector in all municipalities during the final \nthree years under centralized rule (1991-3; dark bars), with decentralized investment by \nall municipalities during the first three years after reform (1994-6; light bars).  To better \ncompare like with like, we omit sectors such as hydrocarbons, mining and national \ndefense, which are not well suited to local government action (and remained the \nresponsibility of central government in Bolivia).  The differences are large.  In the years \nleading up to reform, central government invested most in transport, energy and \nmultisectoral,9 which together accounted for 65% of public investment during 1991-3.  \nAfter decentralization, local governments invest most heavily in education, urban \ndevelopment, and water & sanitation, together accounting for 79% of municipal \ninvestment.  Of the top three sectors in both cases, accounting for the great majority of \ntotal investment, central and local government have not one in common.  The evidence \n 15\nimplies that local and central government have very different investment priorities.  \nDecentralizing power and resources to municipal governments is associated with a shift \nin public investment away from economic production and infrastructure, and into social \nservices and human capital formation. \nFigure 2 \nCentral vs. Local Government Investment (Bolivia)\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45%\nEducation\nUrban Development\nWater and Sanitation\nTransport\nHealth\nEnergy\nAgriculture\nWater Management\nMultisectoral\nCommunications\nIndustry\nSe\nct\nor\nPercent of Total\nCentral\nLocal\n \nSource: National Secretariat of Public Investment and External Finance; original calculations. \n \n Consider also how investment was distributed geographically among Bolivia\u2019s \nmunicipalities before and after decentralization.  Figure 3 shows quasi-histograms of total \ninvestment in all of Bolivia\u2019s municipalities in per-capita terms, again for the last three \nyears under centralized rule vs. the first three years of decentralization.  The vertical bars \nmeasure the proportion of Bolivia\u2019s municipalities that received investments in the given \nranges.  The chart shows that central government invested very unequally, with almost \nhalf of all municipalities receiving nothing while a small number received huge sums \n(over Bs.50,000\/capita in one case), and the mean well outside the modal range.  Under \n 16\nlocal government, by contrast, investment was much more equal: No districts received \nzero and none received more than Bs.620\/capita, the modal range contains the mean, and \nthe standard deviation is 97% lower than central government\u2019s.  Closer inspection of the \nleftmost column (\u201c=0\u201d) in the left-hand chart below reveals that it is composed \noverwhelmingly of the smallest, poorest, most rural districts.  These are the \nmunicipalities that were most affected by decentralization. \nFigure 3: Distribution of Central and Local Government Investment by Amount \nLocal Government Investment (s.d. = Bs.90\/capita)\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\n50%\n=0\n0-\n50\n50\n-1\n00\n10\n0-\n15\n0\n15\n0-\n20\n0\n20\n0-\n25\n0\n25\n0-\n30\n0\n30\n0-\n35\n0\n35\n0-\n40\n0\n40\n0-\n45\n0\n45\n0-\n50\n0\n50\n0-\n75\n0\n75\n0-\n1k\n1k\n-1\n0k\n>1\n0k\nRange (Bs\/cap)\nSh\nar\ne \nof\n M\nun\nic\nip\nal\niti\nes\nMean = 165 Bs\/capita\nCentral Government Investment (s.d. = Bs.3387\/capita)\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\n50%\n=0\n0-\n50\n50\n-1\n00\n10\n0-\n15\n0\n15\n0-\n20\n0\n20\n0-\n25\n0\n25\n0-\n30\n0\n30\n0-\n35\n0\n35\n0-\n40\n0\n40\n0-\n45\n0\n45\n0-\n50\n0\n50\n0-\n75\n0\n75\n0-\n1k\n1k\n-1\n0k\n>1\n0k\nRange (Bs\/cap)\nSh\nar\ne \nof\n M\nun\nic\nip\nal\niti\nes\nMean = 581 Bs\/capita\n \nSource: National Secretariat of Public Investment and External Finance; original calculations.  Note irregular outer intervals. \n \nSo decentralization seems to have changed the sectoral uses of investment and its \ndistribution across space.  Did its effects run any deeper?  Figure 4 plots education \ninvestment under central and local government (three-year totals again) vs. local illiteracy \nrates for all of Bolivia\u2019s municipalities.  We use the illiteracy rate as a proxy for a \ndistrict\u2019s need for more education investment.10  The most striking thing about the left-\nhand plot is how few nonzero observations there are before decentralization \u2013 only 15% \nof districts recorded any investment at all under central government.  The regression line \nis negative with a modest slope, although not quite significant at the 10% level (probably \n 17\nbecause of so few non-zero observations).  Contrast that with decentralized government, \nwhere 97% of districts invested in the sector, amounts are larger across the board, and the \nregression line on illiteracy is positively sloped and significant at the 1% level.  \nDecentralization appears to have transformed education policy from one that ignored \nmost municipalities in order to focus resources in those best-provided, to one that \ninvested essentially everywhere, focusing resources where existing levels of education \nwere worst.  Section 5 looks at this question much more rigorously. \nFigure 4: Education Investment vs. Illiteracy \nCentral Government, 1991-93\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nIlliteracy Rate (%)\nEd\nuc\nat\nio\nn \nIn\nve\nst\nm\nen\nt \nLocal Government, 1994-97\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 7\nIlliteracy Rate (%)\nEd\nuc\nat\nio\nn \nIn\nve\nst\nm\nen\nt \n(B\ns\/\nca\np)\n0\n \nSources: National Institute of Statistics, National Secretariat of Popular Participation, National Secretariat of Public \nInvestment and External Finance; original calculations. \n (c) Colombia \nDetailed municipal-level expenditure and investment data are available for \nColombia only from 1994.  Hence we cannot examine investment priorities under a \nrelatively \u201cpure\u201d centralized regime (i.e. which ended in the mid-1970s), as we did for \nBolivia.  But the characteristics of Colombia\u2019s reform process, marked by gradualism and \nlong-term change, make this less of a problem.  As discussed above, a number of key \ndecentralizing mechanisms, such as citizens\u2019 initiatives, referenda, mayoral recall, and \nincreased resource transfers, were only put in place with the 1991 constitutional reform and \n 18\naccompanying regulations.  These transferred resources and authority to municipalities \ngradually over time.  Hence the outlines of Colombia\u2019s decentralization \u201cpackage\u201d became \nfully clear only in 1992-93, setting off a process that deepened thereafter.  Indeed, the \nempirical measures of decentralization that we use below all show monotonically increasing \nlevels of decentralization throughout the period 1994-2004.  Hence hereafter we treat 1993-\n94 as years with relatively high centralization, and 2003-04 as years with relatively high \ndecentralization. \nHow did decentralization affect public investment patterns?  In order to examine \nthe investment priorities of central vs. local government as closely as we can, figure 5 \ncompares central government investment in 1994 with local government investment of \nown resources (i.e. local taxes and charges) in 2003.11  As for Bolivia, the differences are \nlarge.  Central government\u2019s largest category, at 38% of the total, is infrastructure, \nwhereas local government\u2019s largest is health, followed by education, which together \ncomprise 81% of the local investment budget.  The broader pattern of dark and light bars \nin figure 5 shows a clear shift in public sector priorities, and resources, away from \ninfrastructure and industry and commerce, into health, education, and water and \nsanitation.  The similarity with Bolivia is striking. \n 19\nFigure 5 \nCentral vs. Local Government Investment (Colombia)\n0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50%\nEducation\nHealth\nWater and Sanitation\nInfrastructure\nIndustry and Commerce\nCulture\nSe\nct\nor\nPercent of Total\nCentral\nLocal\n \nSource: National Planning Department; original calculations. \nWith respect to the geographic distribution of investment, figure 6 provides \nhistograms of the public investment in Colombia\u2019s municipalities in 1994 vs. 2003.  \nAmounts are given in constant 2002 pesos per capita, again divided by source between \ncentral and local governments.  As decentralization deepened, both central and local \ninvestment became more dispersed, especially in the upper tails.  This implies increasing \ninequality in investment, with some municipalities receiving much greater per capita \nsums than the norm.  Both means rose significantly over the period, by 53% in the case of \ncentral government, and 105% for local government, implying that districts benefited \nquite significantly from increasing levels of investment by both central and local \ngovernments.  Standard deviations were quite similar for central and local government in \neach period.  The charts show clearly that the major differences are between 1994 and \n2003, and not between center and periphery. \n 20\nFigure 6: Distribution of Central and Local Government Investment by Amount \nCentral Government, 2003 (s.d. = $80,726\/capita)\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\n0-\n50\n50\n-1\n00\n10\n0-\n15\n0\n15\n0-\n20\n0\n20\n0-\n25\n0\n25\n0-\n30\n0\n30\n0-\n35\n0\n35\n0-\n40\n0\n40\n0-\n45\n0\n45\n0-\n50\n0\n50\n0-\n55\n0\n55\n0-\n60\n0\nRange ($\/cap)\nSh\nar\ne \nof\n M\nun\nic\nip\nal\niti\nes\nMean = $221,435\/capita\nLocal Government, 2003 (s.d. = $79,998\/capita)\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\n0-\n50\n50\n-1\n00\n10\n0-\n15\n0\n15\n0-\n20\n0\n20\n0-\n25\n0\n25\n0-\n30\n0\n30\n0-\n35\n0\n35\n0-\n40\n0\n40\n0-\n45\n0\n45\n0-\n50\n0\n50\n0-\n55\n0\n55\n0-\n60\n0\nRange ($\/cap)\nSh\nar\ne \nof Mean = $145,878\/capita\nCentral Government, 1994 (s.d. = $51,093\/capita)\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\n0-\n50\n50\n-1\n00\n10\n0-\n15\n0\n15\n0-\n20\n0\n20\n0-\n25\n0\n25\n0-\n30\n0\n30\n0-\n35\n0\n35\n0-\n40\n0\n40\n0-\n45\n0\n45\n0-\n50\n0\n50\n0-\n55\n0\n55\n0-\n60\n0\nRange ($\/cap)\nSh\nar\ne \nof\n M\nun\nic\nip\nal\niti\nes Mean = $144,876\/capita\nLocal Government, 1994 (s.d. = $59,698\/capita)\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\n40%\n45%\n0-\n50\n50\n-1\n00\n10\n0-\n15\n0\n15\n0-\n20\n0\n20\n0-\n25\n0\n25\n0-\n30\n0\n30\n0-\n35\n0\n35\n0-\n40\n0\n40\n0-\n45\n0\n45\n0-\n50\n0\n50\n0-\n55\n0\n55\n0-\n60\n0\nRange ($\/cap)\nSh\nar\ne \nof Mean = $71,301\/capita\n \nSource: National Planning Department; original calculations. \nLastly, is there any evidence that these broad changes in resource flows affected \ndevelopment outcomes of interest?  We focus again on education, and in particular on \nschool attendance figures.  Figure 7 shows enrollment data for the period in question, for \nboth public and private schools, with enrollment in 1994 indexed to 1.  At the outset, \npublic and private enrollment trends are quite similar.  After 1996 an increasing gap \nopens up between them, although they continue to trend up and down in parallel.  After \n1999, however, the slopes diverge, leading to a large gap between the two educational \nsystems.  Decentralization seems to coincide with a 20 percent increase in school \nenrollment.  The concentration of improvement in public schools, where enrollment \nincreased 30 percent while the private system\u2019s fell seven percent, suggests that local \ngovernments may have been able to run schools and promote attendance better than \ncentral government had before.  But such descriptive evidence is far from conclusive.  \n 21\nWe return to this question with much more rigor in section 5.  But before we can do so, \nwe must lay out our methodology. \nFigure 7: Decentralization and School Enrollment \nIndex of Public and Private School Enrollment\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\nEn\nro\nllm\nen\nt I\nnd\nex\nPublic Private Total\n \nSource: National Planning Department; original calculations. \n4. METHODOLOGY \nThe evidence thus far suggests that decentralization changed both countries\u2019 \npublic investment patterns in important ways, and may have improved the targeting of \npublic services as well.  But stronger evidence is needed if we are to reach firm \nconclusions.  Ideally such a comparison would be based on very similar regression \nequations for both countries.  But the different nature of reform in the two countries \u2013 a \nmassive decentralization shock versus more gradual reform \u2013 demands that we use \ndifferent empirical approaches, even though we ask similar questions of each case.  In \naddition, there is simply more and higher-quality data available for Colombia, which \nallows us to push the analysis further into the realm of public sector outputs.  Hence for \nColombia we investigate decentralization\u2019s effect on the number of children attending \npublic schools.  For Bolivia, the data restricts us to examining whether decentralization \n 22\nmade investment allocations more responsive to local need.12  Due to space constraints, \nwe present detailed results for education only.  It is worth mentioning that we have \nsimilar estimations for health and water and sanitation in both countries, and for urban \ndevelopment and agriculture in Bolivia as well.  Those findings are closely consistent \nwith the results presented below. \n(a) Bolivia \nWe need an empirical strategy that can cope with the generalized shock to Bolivia \nof reform.  Our aim is to test whether decentralization made public investment more \nresponsive to local needs.  This can be separated into two questions: (i) did public sector \ninvestment patterns change with decentralization? and if so, (ii) do indicators of need \ndetermine that change?  The problem with asking such questions for Bolivia is the \nabsolute lack of time-series data for social, demographic, and institutional variables.  \nHow can we investigate decentralization\u2019s effects given good time-series data on national \nand local investment flows, but cross-sectional-only data for other variables?  One of the \nmain contributions of this paper is to provide a methodology for doing so, which is as \nfollows. \nUsing the panel data described above, we estimate the model \n Gmt = \u03b21\u03b1m + \u03b22\u03b1*m + \u03b23\u03b4t + \u03b5mt (1) \nwhere Gmt denotes public investment by sector (Education, Health, etc.) in each locality, \n\u03b1m and \u03b4t are vectors of state and year dummy variables, and \u03b1*m = \u03b1mDt, where Dt is a \ndecentralization dummy variable that takes the values 0 before 1994 and 1 after, \nsubscripted by municipality m and year t.13  Investment patterns are thus decomposed \ninto three terms: a year effect, \u03b4t, which captures year shocks and time-specific \n 23\ncharacteristics; a state effect, \u03b1m, which captures all of the characteristics of a state fixed \nin time; and a decentralization-interacted state effect, \u03b1*m, which captures state-specific \ncharacteristics that begin in 1994. \nAny systemic changes in Bolivia\u2019s politics or economy that affect all \nmunicipalities similarly, such as a national policy initiative or an external shock, will be \ncaptured by the year term, \u03b4t.  Effects related to municipalities\u2019 fixed characteristics, such \nas their size, location, or environment, will be captured by the state term, \u03b1m.  And any \nlocally-specific effects that kick in only after decentralization are captured by the \u03b1* \nterm.  Knowing what we do about Bolivia as described in section 2(a), the most \nreasonable interpretation of this last term is that it captures two kinds of effects: (i) local \ngovernments, local civic associations and other local institutions created by the reform, \nand (ii) pre-existing local actors and forces made relevant by decentralization \u2013 that is to \nsay, those able to affect policy-making at the local, but not central, level.  Note that this is \nso by construction, and not by assumption.  We use Tobit estimations for equation (1). \n Because \u03b1m and \u03b1*m are dummy variables, one for each of Bolivia\u2019s 310 \nmunicipalities, equation (1) will produce 310 separate \u03b21\u2019s, and 310 \u03b22\u2019s.  We then \nperform three tests: \n1. \u03b21 = \u03b22   A t-test of whether the means of the coefficients of \u03b1m and \u03b1*m are \nsignificantly different, for each sector.  We interpret significance as evidence that \ndecentralization changed national investment patterns through the actions of local \ngovernments and newly-empowered local actors. \n2. \u03b21m = \u03b22m   An F-test of whether the coefficients of \u03b1m and \u03b1*m are different \nmunicipality by municipality.  Significance implies that decentralization changed \n 24\nlocal investment patterns in a particular municipality.  Significance in many \nmunicipalities constitutes stronger evidence that decentralization changed national \ninvestment patterns in that sector. \n3. Lastly, we use the values of \u03b21m and \u03b22m to estimate the model \n\u03b22m \u2013 \u03b21m = \u03b6Sm + \u03b7Zm + \u03b3Pm + \u03b5m (2) \nwhere the LHS is the differences in state dummy coefficients from equation (1), S is a \nvector of the existing stock of public services at an initial period; Z is a vector of \nmeasures of civil institutions, private sector dynamism, and municipal project \nplanning procedures, all local and only relevant after decentralization; and P is a \nvector of political participation and the prevalence of left-wing ideology.  All are \nindexed by municipality m.  This approach isolates the changes in investment patterns \nresulting from decentralization, and then examines their determinants. \nBy construction, \u03b22m \u2013 \u03b21m should be unrelated to all factors which remain constant \nbetween the two periods, and thus we omit socio-economic, regional and other variables \nthat do not change with decentralization.  Our interpretation of the term is that it captures \nthe effects on investment patterns of the new institutions and political economy dynamics \ncreated by decentralization, net of municipalities\u2019 fixed characteristics, such as size, \nregion, ethnic composition, etc.  Given the lack of time series data on Z and S variables, \nan additional advantage of our methodology is that it provides a natural way to hold these \nterms constant in equation (2).  We will interpret S as an indicator of need at an initial \nperiod (see below), and so it is reasonable to hold it constant.  It is less satisfying to hold \nZ constant, although the briefness of the period in question, 1994-1996, makes this less \nproblematic than it may initially seem.14  We report results for tests 1 and 2 for 10 sectors \n 25\n(as defined by Bolivia\u2019s finance ministry).  We report results from test 3 only for \neducation. \n There are literally dozens of variables that might be included in the Z vector, \ncovering such specific items as municipal employee characteristics and decision-making \nprocesses, and how investment projects are planned and written into the local budget.15  \nWe use principal component analysis to reduce a large set of very specific Z-type \nvariables into a smaller number of indicators that are conceptually coherent.  The \nobjective of this technique is to find the unit-length combinations of explanatory \nvariables with highest variance.  We follow Maddala (1977) and Greene (1997) in \ncalculating variables z1 to zk where z is a linear combination of explanatory (x) variables \n z1 = a1x1 + a2x2 + \u2026 + aLxL\n z2 = b1x1 + b2x2 + \u2026 + bLxL    etc. \nranked in order of variance, with highest first.  Principal component analysis regresses y \non z1, z2, \u2026, zk, where k < L and z\u2019s are constructed so as to be orthogonal.  So long as \nthe z\u2019s chosen represent combinations of variables that can be interpreted meaningfully, \nthis provides a method for estimating parsimonious models with limited loss of \ninformation.  We construct principal component variables (PCVs) for three categories of \nexplanatory variables, and use the largest eigenvector for each (i.e. z1).  These are \ncharacterized as follows: \nPrincipal Component Variables \n \nCategory Interpretation: Variable increases in\u2026 \nPrivate sector Dynamism of the local private sector \nProject planning Informed project planning that follows open and \n consensual procedures \nCivil institutions Strength of local civil institutions and organizations \n 26\n The main variable of interest in test 3 is S, which we interpret as a district\u2019s need \nfor additional public investment at the outset of decentralization.  We use three measures \nof illiteracy and literacy rates, plus the existence of a functioning local education \nauthority, as rough indicators of the level of education provision in each municipality.  \nAssuming that the marginal utility of a public service falls as the level of that service \nrises, we interpret high illiteracy (low literacy) rates as indicative of a greater need for \nadditional education investment.  The existence of a properly constituted local education \nauthority similarly indicates higher provision, and hence lower need.  We thus expect \ncoefficient \u03b6 to be positive when illiteracy rates are used, and negative when the literacy \nrate is used.  This would imply that decentralization led government to invest more \nheavily in places where initial levels of education were low.  A positive coefficient, by \ncontrast, would imply that decentralization accentuated educational disparities, as better \nprovided municipalities received higher levels of additional investment. \n The variables in Z are not only controls.  Their coefficients, \u03b7, are of interest \ninsofar as they help explain the mechanisms by which local government is more (or less) \nresponsive than central government to real local need.  The case put forward by political \nscientists16 for local government\u2019s superior assessment of local preferences includes \ngreater sensitivity to grass-roots demand, greater accessibility of local lobby groups to \nlocal government, and greater political accountability to the local populace.  Some of the \nways in which this can happen include the use of open, informed planning techniques, \nand the existence of private sector and civic organizations that are strong and dynamic.  \nRemember that such local factors were not relevant to central decision-making, which \noccurred at the center.  Variables P capture another local feature that changed \n 27\nsignificantly with decentralization: the power of relatively small groups of voters to \ninfluence policy makers\u2019 decisions via local elections.  We expect districts where \nelectoral participation increased with decentralization to be less subject to the sort of elite \ncapture that Bardhan and Mookherjee (2000) analyze.  And left-wing parties\u2019 share of the \nvote captures an underlying local ideological characteristic that should increase education \ninvestment independently of need. \n(b) Colombia \nReform in Colombia was more gradual, phased in over a number of years.  We \ntake advantage of this to construct continuous variables that capture advancing reform in \nColombia, and use panel estimations that incorporate much more information than is \npossible for Bolivia.  And as noted above, the availability of higher-quality data further \nallows us to investigate decentralization\u2019s effects on real policy outputs, and not just \nchanges in resource inputs.  Section 3 showed that decentralization in Colombia was \nassociated with a marked increase in the number of state-school students.  In order to \ninvestigate this relationship more rigorously, we estimate the model \n \u0394Smt = \u03b1 + \u03b6Dmt + \u03b2Rmt + \u03b3Pmt + \u03b4Cmt + \u03b5mt (3) \nwhere \u0394S is the year-on-year increase in student enrollment in state schools, D is a vector \nof measures of where municipalities lie on the decentralization-centralization continuum, \nR is a vector of measures of resource availability (i.e. supply factors) that might \nindependently increase student enrollment, P is a vector of variables measuring political \nparticipation and engagement, and C is a vector of socioeconomic and geographic \ncontrols, all indexed by municipality m and year t. \n 28\nOur measures of decentralization, D, are based on municipal expenditures in \neducation broken down by source of revenue.  They measure different levels of autonomy \nin municipal decision-making and resource commitment.  The first is own resources \u2013 \nrevenue raised from local taxes and charges \u2013 as a share of total expenditure.  Such funds \nhave no strings attached, and are at the free disposal of local governments to spend as \nthey like.  The second variable, Municipal Independence, is the product of a dummy \nvariable that records which municipalities are \u201ccertified\u201d, multiplied by the resource \ntransfers that certification triggers to each municipality.  Certified municipalities receive \ntransfers directly from central government, and not via the departmental (i.e. regional) \nlevel.  Departments have discretion in how they pass on funds destined for municipal \nuses, and so certified municipalities are more independent of departmental influence and \nmeddling.  By interacting the certification dummy with resource flows, we generate an \nindicator that can distinguish relatively small differences in municipal discretion and \nindependence.  Local governments that score higher in these two variables are \nsubstantively more decentralized than the rest. \nThe third variable records the share of total educational expenditure accounted for \nby central transfers allocated according to poverty indices, for the period 1994-2001.17  In \n2001, Law 715 changed this allocation mechanism to one based on the number of state \nschool students.  Hence the fourth D variable, which records central transfers based on \nstudent numbers as a share of total expenditure, for the period 2002-04.  Municipalities \nwith higher values in these indicators face stronger incentives set by the center, and are \nthus much more \u201ccentralized\u201d.  The coefficients of these four D variables, \u03b61... \u03b64 are our \n 29\nmain interest in this regression.  If decentralization drives increases in enrollment, then \nwe would expect \u03b61 and \u03b62 to be positive, and \u03b63 and \u03b64 to be negative. \nOther factors which might affect student enrollment independently of \ndecentralization include how richly a municipality funds its schools, and the general \nbuoyancy of municipal revenues.  We control for such effects with R, which includes two \nterms for municipalities\u2019 general expenditure growth (separated into the periods before \nand after Law 715), a term for per capita expenditure on public education, and one for the \nstudent-teacher ratio. \nPolitical controls P include overall turnout, the mayor\u2019s electoral support, a \ndummy variable indicating electoral years, and the share of total municipal personnel \nwho are university graduates, as a measure of local government\u2019s institutional capacity.  \nLastly, the variables in C control for municipal size, wealth, inequality, unemployment, \nand what region it is in, as well as the 1999 recession.  We also include measures of a \nmunicipality\u2019s displaced population, separated between those that receive migratory \nflows and those that expel them, as rough proxies for how much a locality has been \nimpacted by Colombia\u2019s armed conflict.  Two final terms, the gross enrollment rate and \nthe proportion of the school-age population attending private education, capture level \neffects and complementarities between public and private enrollment. \nThe specification in (3) is based on the theory that a given level of expenditure \nwill produce improved outputs when allocated and executed locally rather than centrally.  \nIn this case, outputs are measured as student enrollment rates, and inputs are measured as \nlocally-controlled resources.  But there is the possibility of the opposite relationship, and \nhence endogeneity, if instead it is increasing enrollment rates that are causing \n 30\nmunicipalities to spend more of their own resources on education.  Hence we also \nestimate equation (3) instrumenting for D1 with the log of local tax revenues per capita in \nperiods t-1 and t-2.  The economic logic for this instrument is that lagged per capita taxes \nshould have a high correlation with Own Resources\/Total Education Expenditures, but a \nlow correlation with increases in student enrollment.  This is because there is no sense in \nwhich the level of local taxes per capita should be associated with changes in school \nenrollments.  Pairwise correlations of the variables bear this out, with ten-fold difference \nin the respective correlations.  We use 2SLS panel estimations.18  A Sargan test confirms \nthat lagged per-capita taxes are suitable instruments for the share of own resources in \ntotal education spending.  Both sets of results are presented below. \n5. DECENTRALIZATION\u2019S EFFECTS \u2013 MORE RIGOROUS EVIDENCE \nThis section lays out econometric evidence that decentralization made public \ninvestment in education more responsive to real local needs in Bolivia, and led to \nsubstantive improvements in service delivery in Colombia. \n(a) Bolivia \nFigure 8 shows the results for tests 1 and 2.  Using national mean values, the null \nhypothesis, \u03b21 = \u03b22, can be rejected for eight of the 10 sectors tested.  Only in health and \nenergy did decentralization appear to make no difference to public investment patterns.  \nTest 2 shows the number of municipalities where we can reject the hypothesis \u03b21m = \u03b22m.  \nFive sectors pass this more demanding test: education, water & sanitation, agriculture, \nurban development and water management.  In three sectors, \u03b21 \u2260 \u03b22 with high levels of \nconfidence when national means are used, whereas using local values, \u03b21m = \u03b22m almost \n 31\neverywhere.  This combination of results implies that reform led to very large shifts in \ninvestment flows in a small number of municipalities, and insignificant changes \neverywhere else. \nIndividual Municipality\nTest Test Tests Significant, by\nSector  \u03b22\u2212\u03b21 t-statistic P Value Number Percent\nEducation 0.01558 22.798 0.0000 209 71%\nWater & Sanitation -0.01548 -17.343 0.0000 224 76%\nAgriculture -0.01402 -8.667 0.0000 65 22%\nUrban Development 0.00484 5.324 0.0000 107 36%\nWater Management 0.00107 2.932 0.0034 105 36%\nTransport -0.10616 -5.967 0.0000 29 10%\nCommunication -0.00246 -4.011 0.0001 7 2%\nIndustry & Tourism -0.00171 -3.768 0.0002 7 2%\nHealth -0.00117 -1.540 0.1238 49 17%\nEnergy -0.00475 -1.281 0.2004 7 2%\nTest 1 Test 2\nNational Means\n \nN = 295 for all sectors \nFigure 8: Did decentralization change Bolivian investment patterns? \nSo decentralization is associated with changes in national investment patterns, and \nthese changes were strongest in education, water, urban development and agriculture.  \nSection 3 showed that education\u2019s share of local investment rose impressively after \ndecentralization, and test 1 concurs.

The existence of a functioning \nlocal education authority appears to have no effect.  These results are insensitive to \ndifferent measures of illiteracy, and to different specifications, as figure 9 shows.  Hence \nin a context of rising education investment nationwide, municipalities where education \nindicators were disproportionately poor made disproportionately large investments in \nnew or improved schooling.  Conversely, those where education indicators were \nunusually good saw increases below the mean, choosing instead to prioritize other \n 33\nsectors.19  We interpret this as evidence that decentralization made education investment \nmore responsive to real local need than it had been under central government. \n Education investment rises where civil institutions are more vigorous, but falls \nwhere the private sector is stronger.  Both institutional features are examples of local \nactors that would have had almost no voice under centralized policy making, but whose \ninfluence was greatly increased by decentralization.  We interpret these results as a sign \nof local political competition between opposing forces: on one hand grass roots civic \nsupport for better education services \u2013 i.e. parents worried about their children; and on \nthe other, private firms lobbying for resources to flow to other sectors where they stand to \nprofit more.20  Informed, participative project planning methodologies appear to have no \neffect.  Left-wing parties\u2019 share of the vote is also insignificant.  The change in electoral \nabsenteeism has the expected sign, and is thus consistent with the civil institutions \nvariable, but is not significant at the 10% level.  These results confirm those of Faguet \n(2004) and extend them with the inclusion of political variables. \n(b) Colombia \n Our results from estimating equation (3) appear in figure 10.  Model 1 is a panel \n(OLS) estimation.  Model 2 is an IV estimation, instrumenting for own resources with the \nlevel of lagged per capita taxes.  Models 3 and 4 provide IV estimates of the same model \nfor municipalities with fewer than 20,000 and 50,000 inhabitants, allowing us to focus on \nsmaller, overwhelmingly rural localities.  A Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions \nconfirms that instruments and residuals are uncorrelated, and hence lagged local taxes are \nassociated with exogenous variation in own resources.

This implies strong evidence that public school enrollment rises \nas the share of own resources in total education expenditures rises, and when \nmunicipalities are more independent.  Interestingly, the effect appears to be larger in the \nsmallest municipalities.  By contrast, \u03b63 and \u03b64 are negative and significant at the 1% \nlevel in four of the models, and at the 5% level in a fifth.  This implies that where central \ntransfers form a large part of total expenditures, and hence municipalities face strong \nincentives set by the center, public enrollment falls, although the evidence is less strong \nthan for the previous finding.  We interpret this as evidence that decentralization of \neducation has led to improved educational outcomes in Colombia, in the sense of more \nstudents attending school.  By contrast, in those places where central control persists, \noutcomes appear to have worsened. \n Supply-side measures of resources availability are all strongly significant.  They \nshow that enrollment increases as expenditure grows, and falls with the student-teacher \n 36\nratio, as one would expect.  Curiously, the per capita expenditure term is also negative, \nand the evidence for this is quite strong.  This implies that raising student numbers are \nnot a simple question of increasing the education budget, but rather based on other \nfactors, such as how and where funds are invested.  These findings are robust to different \nspecifications\/instrumentation. \n Amongst our political controls, electoral support for the mayor is positive and \nstrongly significant in all four models, implying a larger effect on enrollment in places \nwhere the mayor has strong political backing.  Electoral turnout is significant at the 5% \nlevel only in the OLS model.  And there is essentially no evidence that the quality of \nlocal government\u2019s human resources matters. \nAmongst socioeconomic and geographic controls, results of interest include the \nfirst three coefficients, implying that districts that are smaller, relatively more equal, and \nwith a higher level of unsatisfied basic needs saw greater increases in enrollment.  These \nresults hold, or even increase, amongst smaller municipalities.  Public enrollment also \nrises with the share of students attending private schools, indicating complementarity \nbetween the public and private education systems.  This contradicts the impression of \nsubstitution between public and private enrollment implied in figure 7.  Decentralization \nappears not to improve public schooling at the expense of private schools, but rather to \npromote the idea of education more generally.  Other control variables capturing the \nimpact of Colombia\u2019s armed violence, the 1999 recession, level effects, and a district\u2019s \nregion are also significant. \n 37\n6. CONCLUSIONS \nThe evidence from Bolivia and Colombia is consistent with some of the central \nclaims in favor of decentralization.  In both countries decentralization appears to have \nshifted public investment patterns in important ways, switching resources out of \ninfrastructure and industry, and into primary social services such as education and water \n& sanitation.  The evidence for Bolivia suggests that public investment in education \nbecame more responsive to real local needs, rising disproportionately in areas with the \nworst education indicators.  As an implicit targeting strategy this is efficient, and \nprobably served to improve educational outcomes, especially in rural areas.  \nUnfortunately, data constraints do not allow us to test that theory. \nBut we can for the case of Colombia, and the results are strong: decentralization \nimproved enrollment rates in public schools.  In districts where educational finance and \npolicy making were under greater local control, enrollment increased.  In districts where \neducational finance was still based on centrally-controlled criteria, enrollment fell.  \nFurther evidence suggests that this was not the simple result of increasing financing \nlevels, but due instead to the quality of investment that municipalities achieved \u2013 to how \nand where funds were spent.  Of course, enrollment is only a proximate educational \noutcome; deeper outcomes of interest include literacy, numeracy and standardized test \nresults.  Current data limitations prevent us from using such variables here.  Based on the \nresults above, however, we would expect to see improving literacy rates as a result of \ndecentralizing education in the medium to long term. \nIt is striking that in both countries, the major policy changes identified were \ndriven by the behavior of the smallest, poorest, most rural municipalities.  To understand \nthis properly, we must place it in the context of what came before.  In Bolivia, central \n 38\ngovernment traditionally ignored small, rural districts, whereas in Colombia the center \ninvested much more equitably prior to reform.  In both countries, decentralization \nempowered the smallest, poorest districts disproportionately, and their collective \nresponse altered national investment patterns.  But decentralization in Bolivia included a \nhuge fiscal equalization shock, which led to much larger changes in the uses and spatial \ndistribution of national investment than for Colombia. \nThis underlines an important point that is often ignored: decentralization is not a \nprogram, but rather a process that relocates power and resources from officials at the \ncenter to others at the periphery.  Its effects depend very much on the character of central \ndecision-making \u2013 on how the center used its power and resources \u2013 before reform began.  \nEven the most transparent, well-meaning local administrations might find it difficult to \nimprove upon the performance of a central government that was effective and well-\ninformed. \nBut performance did improve, at least in education.  In Bolivia public investment \nbecame more responsive to local needs, and in Colombia more children went to school.  \nThese substantive, localized improvements are at least in part due to the new incentives \nreform put in place.  Before decentralization, central officials stationed beyond national \nand regional capitals had little reason to concern themselves with local demands.  Career \nsuccess was determined by ministerial fiat unrelated to local outcomes in distant districts.  \nThroughout most of each country, ordinary citizens\u2019 ordinary concerns were given little \nattention.  Decentralization changed this by creating local authorities beholden to local \nvoters.  Nationwide, it put real power over public resources in the hands of ordinary \ncitizens.

They proved wrong. \n3 \u201cInjertos Tramposos en \u2018Participaci\u00f3n Popular\u2019\u201d, Hoy, January 19, 1994; \u201cLa Declaratoria de Guerra del \nPrimer Mandatario\u201d, La Razon, January 27, 1994; and \u201cArrogancia Insultante\u201d, Presencia, February 27, \n1994 are only three of the many articles which appeared in the Bolivian press documenting popular \nreaction to the \u201cDamned Law\u201d.  These are documented in Unidad de Comunicaci\u00f3n (1995). \n4 S\u00e1nchez (2000) shows that central transfers grew from 2% of GDP in 1990 to almost 7% in 1997. \n5 Colombia\u2019s public accounts classify such items as teachers\u2019 and health workers\u2019 salaries as investments, \nand not running costs. \n6 The Frente Nacional (1957-74) quelled La Violencia by sharing out the fruits of power equally between \nLiberals and Conservatives, and restricting electoral competition to those two parties. \n7 In the sense that more data on more local characteristics are collected in Colombia than any other country \nin the region bar Brazil. \n8 Meaning we do not combine information from different sources into a single variable. \n 41\n                                                                                                                                                 \n9 A hodgepodge, including feasibility studies, technical assistance and emergency relief, that is difficult to \ncategorize. \n10 This point is developed further below. \n11 The last year for which comprehensive data are available. \n12 We believe it is preferable to push the analysis as far as each country\u2019s data will allow, as opposed to \nlimiting the Colombian analysis for the sake of symmetry. \n13 Thus \u03b1*m takes the value 0 for all municipalities and all years before 1994, and is identical to \u03b1m for all \nyears from 1994 onwards. \n14 In any event, a lack of time-series data for Z and S would leave us no other choice even with a different \nmethodology. \n15 There are, for example, 18 variables concerning the types of capacity-building programs that \nmunicipalities received after 1994, and 11 more on programs they may have requested. \n16 See for example Wolman in Bennet (1990). \n17 The proportion of the local population above a predetermined level of unsatisfied basic needs. \n18 Note that LHS data is not censored\/truncated.  Observed \u201czeros\u201d are real zeros, and not failures of \nmeasurement or excluded negative values.  Hence a 2SLS panel estimation is appropriate.  As a check, we \nalso estimated the IV model with a Tobit first stage.  The findings did not change. \n19 The small number of municipalities with significant unspent sums implies that the money was spent \nelsewhere, not left in the bank. \n20 Our results for urban development \u2013 typically big, expensive construction projects \u2013 where private sector \nlobbying is strongly positive, support this interpretation. \n \nREFERENCES \nAlesina, A., Carrasquilla, A., & Echavarr\u00eda, J.
