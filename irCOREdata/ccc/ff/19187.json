Two UK surveys report the lifetime\nprevalence of back pain as 59% [1,2] and 7% of the adult\npopulation consult with back pain in any one year [3].\nAlthough common, the management of back pain is not\nstraightforward and many patients continue to have long\nterm back pain [4]. The importance of using a common\nlanguage when communicating to others about back pain\nis acknowledged [5].\nThere are broadly three areas where difficulties in commu-\nnication about back pain arise.\nFirstly, patients seeking information from health care pro-\nfessionals can experience difficulties understanding them\nand the medical literature [5,6]. The use of jargon and of\nmedical models rather than patient-centred lay models,\ntogether with poor communications skills from profes-\nsionals are all considered contributing factors [6]. It is\ntherefore important to shift from medical and scientific\nclassification and terminology to a language understand-\nable to lay people to develop a shared health care pro-\nvider-patient language [5]. Furthermore, patients and\nprofessionals appear to define terms differently leading to\nmisunderstandings when both think they are talking on\ncommon ground by using particular jargon [7,8]. Sec-\nondly, misunderstandings among health professionals\nconcerning terminology can arise. Multiple back pain\nclassification systems and terms exist and many health\nprofessionals use medical terms in various ways reflecting\nhabit, experience, personal views and professional back-\nground [5]. This can hinder effective communication\nbetween professionals [9]. Thirdly, the lack of standard-\nised definitions for back pain terms can make comparison\nof research studies problematic [10].\nDuring a previous qualitative study exploring the views of\nlay people regarding the development and use of mass\nmedia interventions for health-care messages about back\npain, it became apparent that further research was\nrequired to explore the issues surrounding the use of back\npain language and terminology identified in the research\n[8]. Misunderstandings and unintended meanings for\ncommon back pain terms were observed. This study aims\nto explore the meanings and issues surrounding the use of\nexisting terms regarding back pain, commonly used by\nhealth care professionals, lay people who have consulted\nhealth care practitioners for back pain and lay people who\nhave not had back pain.\nMethods\nSample\nA purposive sampling approach was used to achieve a\nsampling frame which included general practitioners, chi-\nropractors, osteopaths, physiotherapists and lay partici-\npants. (Table 1). The sampling frame for lay participants\nincluded men and women, a broad spread of socio eco-\nnomic groupings and ages and those with and without\nexperience of back pain. All those with experience of back\npain had sought professional help. Fifty percent of C2DE\nSocio Economic Group Members had manual occupa-\ntions. Non English speakers were excluded. All health pro-\nfessionals worked in Birmingham or the West Midlands\nregion and all lay participants lived in the West Midlands.\nFocus Groups\nParticipants were approached and recruited by an inde-\npendent professional qualitative research agency. Lay par-\nticipants were approached on the street and were invited\nto a local focus group, which were held at convenient\nhotel venues. Health care professionals were approached\nby telephone and profession specific groups for Chiro-\npractors, General Practitioners, Osteopaths and Physio-\ntherapists were held, again at convenient hotel venues.\nInformed consent was sought at the groups. Participants\nwere offered refreshments, and given either a \u00a330 shop-\nping voucher (lay participants) or \u00a360 (health care profes-\nsionals). Groups lasted for approximately one hour. All\nfocus groups were lead by MR, an independent profes-\nsional qualitative researcher. A list of medical terms was\npresented individually; verbally and also written on cards.\nThe list was not intended to be exhaustive. Terms were\nidentified from multiple sources including journals, text-\nbooks and local copies of medical correspondence pro-\nvided to patients. The list of terms was used in reverse\norder in four groups to minimise order effects. The Sched-\nule can be seen in Table 2 and the terms in Table 3. Ethics\napproval for the study was sought and attained -REC ref-\nerence number: 05\/Q1605\/62.\nData Analysis\nFocus groups were tape recorded and full transcripts of\neach focus group underwent line by line analysis, identi-\nfying concepts and their properties. We used a two stage\ncoding process common to qualitative enquiry [11]. Tran-\nscripts were listened to and read several times in order to\nbecome familiar with the accounts and transcripts were\ncoded line by line (MR). This type of initial coding is\nimportant to theory development, but also helps the\nresearcher remain close to the data and helps the\nresearcher to challenge any a priori assumptions and to\nredefine categories based on what is found in the data.\nThe second stage of data coding involves making a list of\nemerging themes and looking for connections between\nthem. The aim of this second stage of coding is to make\nconnections between segments of data and to develop\ntheoretical concepts. Division between first and second\nstage coding is somewhat arbitrary. It might be more use-\nful to think of analysis of the data, as an ongoing process\nthat continually switches between first and second stagePage 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/123coding in order to remain close to the data, and to chal-\nlenge any a priori assumptions. However, it is important\nto recognise that this process is an interpretative act and\ndoes not aim at scientific truth. The aim is to provide\ndeeper understanding of human motivation and behav-\niour.\nTriangulation proposes that by using multiple ways of\nlooking at the same thing we can converge on the truth\n[12] The philosophical underpinning of this piece of qual-\nitative research suggests that our aim is not to converge on\nreality, and that there will always be multiple perspectives\n(realities). In this study an independent researcher re-ana-\nTable 1: Summary of groups\nFocus Group Number of Participants Details\n1.

Any dif-\nferences of opinion were discussed and resolved. The aim\nof this was not to converge on a single truth, but to pro-\nvide additional perspectives [13] In this study, member\nchecking was not practical.\nResults\nThe results presented below focus on the findings we\nbelieve to be of most relevance to health professional\nreaders.\nCommon terms do have unintended meanings or negative \nconnotations\nLay participants understood many of the terms explored\nin the group differently to the health professionals. The\nterms, as understood by the lay participants, can be split\ninto three broad categories. Firstly, terms which were not\nunderstood or were misconstrued and which had inad-\nvertent negative connotations or implications. Secondly,\nterms which were not understood or were misconstrued\nbut without this leading to negative emotional responses.\nThirdly, terms which were understood by lay participants\nas the health professionals stated they intended them to\nbe understood. Although the lay participants who had\nbeen treated for back pain demonstrated some greater\ninsight into some very specific terms, generally the areas\nand levels of understanding or misconception were simi-\nlar to non back pain sufferers. The research demonstrated\nthat familiarity with a term is no guarantee of understand-\ning. At least one person in each group discussion with the\nlay participants attempted to define unfamiliar terms;\nusually by guessing. There is insufficient space here to\npresent data for each term. We have chosen to focus on\nterms that were misunderstood by participants and had\nnegative connotations or implications. Some of these are\nof particular interest as they are endorsed in low back pain\nclinical practice guidelines (acute, chronic, recurrent, dis-\nability).\nNon-specific back pain\nNo lay participants were familiar with the phrase non-spe-\ncific back pain. For some it implied that the health profes-\nsional did not understand the cause of their pain, or how\nto treat it. The phrase could suggest that the health profes-\nsional thought that it was \"non-existent\". The phrase also\nhas implications for treatment, suggesting that the patient\nwould be automatically referred for further investigations\nor opinion; \"that spells referral to me.\" Others felt that non-\nspecific meant that pain is not located in a specific place;\n\"you would feel it all over really\", or that it could not be con-\nnected to a specific injury or habit.\nHealth professionals agreed that the intended meaning of\nnon-specific was that a cause has not yet been found, or\nthat there was no diagnosis. However, at the same time\nthey recognised that patients needed to know that the\nhealth professional understood the cause of pain; the\nterm suggested that the professional \"doesn't know what\nshe's doing\". They therefore said that they would not use\nthe phrase to explain pain to patients.\nIt's a posh way of saying I haven't got a clue ... it hurts our\npride to put it down ... patients come to you because they\nwant a diagnosis ... and you're not giving them one.\nTable 3: summarising the responses of members of the public to terms discussed in the focus groups.\nSpeaking a different\nlanguage - terms that could\nlead to problematic misunderstandings\nSpeaking a different\nlanguage - terms with\nunintended meanings but\nfew negative repercussions\nSpeaking a common language\n- terms which the public\nappeared to understand as intended\nAcute (low) back pain\/ache Muscle spasm\nChronic Mechanical back pain\/ache Sensation\nRecurrent Muscle sprain Manipulation\nMuscle Weakness Muscle strain Mobilisation\nInstability Sciatica Soft tissue technique\nNon-specific back pain Radiated Rehabilitation\nNeurological involvement Muscle imbalance\nTrapped nerve Nerve root pain\nParaesthesia Disc - prolapsed, slipped,\nManaging your back pain Herniated, ruptured\nCoping Facet Joint\nPsychological pain Alignment\nWear and Tear Posture\nArthritis Spondylitis\nExercise Stenosis\nActivity\nDisabilityPage 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/123Acute\nThe lay participants were less familiar with the term acute\nthan chronic in the context of low back pain. For some it\nsuggested that pain was milder than chronic. For a minor-\nity of the low back pain sufferers, acute means recent or\ncurrent. Acute was usually understood as severe, in a spe-\ncific spot or sharp.\n... acute could be more localized ... its acute, just one spot.\nLike acute appendicitis. It's just that area.\nHealth professionals believed that the intended usage of\nacute was pain of recent onset, but that lay people inter-\npreted acute as a term which quantifies severity of pain.\n... It's a temporal thing rather than a qualitative.\nHealth professionals therefore did not use the term to\ndescribe pain to patients, although they did use it in\npatient notes.\nI think patients if they go \"Oh I've got acute back pain\" they\nthink it's like a quantifying factor ...that's why I don't tend\nto use it because ... it's incorrect language.\nChronic\nThe lay participants were very familiar with the term\nchronic in the context of low back pain. Most felt that\nchronic meant that the condition was very severe. To some\nis suggested that the pain was incurable.\nChronic means absolute, the pits.\nCouple of steps from a wheelchair.\nFor others chronic meant long-term or constant\n(Chronic) lasts as well, doesn't it? Acute can be a short\nperiod of time.\nI think chronic is long-term.\nHealth professionals were aware that lay people inter-\npreted chronic as severe and or \"incurable\", and preferred\nto use phrases such as \"long-term\", \"long-standing\" and\n\"ongoing\".\nIt implies again something that's ... going to be there for-\never.\nI don't use it that much because again it's like degenerative;\nit's unfair with \"Is this it?\" Am I going to be stuck with\nthis?\" It's scary.\nSome chiropractors and osteopaths thought that chronic\nmight reassure someone that they would receive long-\nterm treatment.\nthe only time I might use things like chronic is if somebody\nhas had a condition for a very long time and they're want-\ning ... a diagnosis, then you can say this is a chronic condi-\ntion and they can go \"OK, now I can manage it\"\nPhysiotherapists tended to write chronic in patient notes,\nbut not say it to patients. They recognised that patients\nmight interpret it in different ways.\nI think there are two definitions actually. One is comparing\nit with acute - in fact acute is like a thunderstorm if you like\nand chronic is like it's raining for a long time. But the\npatients, the elderly patients particularly often use the word\nchronic as something which is absolutely bloody awful.\nRecurrent\nIn contrast to chronic, the term recurrent was interpreted\nby the lay participants as less severe and pain that comes\nand goes, whereas chronic pain never entirely going away.\nYou've always got chronic. It comes in waves. But recurrent\nit can, chronic can't ever go down to zero; you've always got\nsomething wrong.\nGPs agreed that recurrent was often more accurate, useful\nand positive, than chronic in describing a patient's back\npain.\n... I don't think that [chronic] is a word I really use for\npatients. They know that it's chronic ...I think recurrent is\nmore of a description of it. Chronic implies that it goes on\nand on and will never go away.\nPhysiotherapists did use the word recurrent, in particular\nin the context of the important educational role they have\nwith patients.\nWhat I often tell patients ... our role ... is really to prevent\nrecurrence by teaching the patient how to manage his back.\nMuscle weakness\nThe lay participants were unfamiliar with the phrase mus-\ncle weakness in the context of low back pain. Several\ndescribed it as a condition caused by inability to exercise\nor move the body; that \"muscles aren't exercised and giving\nadequate support.\nIf you were in plaster you wouldn't use the muscles in that\nparticular leg. That would create muscle weakness.Page 5 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/123Some thought that muscle weakness was permanent and\nthat it would progress.\nHealth professionals were concerned that patients felt\nmuscle weakness was permanent, or that it implied per-\nsonal weakness.\nI use weakness if you're talking about physio, muscle\nstrengthening exercises and that sort of thing; not very often\nthough ... but the weakness might imply permanent ... no I\nwouldn't go there.\nInstability\nVery few lay participants were familiar with the term insta-\nbility. It was most often interpreted as the back could 'go'\nat any time.\nIf they get you back to working order the back is unstable\nbecause the least little thing can actually throw it off again.\nSomething's a bit loose ... It's liable to pop out.\nBack instability was considered worrying. It tended to sug-\ngest a permanent condition and one from which a sufferer\ncould never relax; \"you're on a knife edge sort of thing.\nIt is not in a stable state so it can't be localised and control-\nled. It can flare up at any time, there's not a lot you can do\nabout it.\nHealth professionals were aware of the negative connota-\ntions of the term and only used it in medical notes. Oste-\nopaths used the words \"loose\" as an alternative, as they\nfelt that this would not worry the patient as much. One\nosteopath said that the advantage of using a word that\nmight worry a patient was that it would encourage the per-\nson to adhere to professional advice and maintain exercise\nregimes.\nThey get a bit worried. I do use the word loose... It's a good\nway to almost, not scare the patients into it, but encourage\npatients to actually go and strengthen an area.\nChiropractors tended to avoid instability seeing it as hav-\ning the potential to cause alarm, and suggesting some-\nthing more serious than it is.\nI think sometimes the word unstable, if you put that idea\ninstability it might panic patients a bit but again it depends\non the context and the patient ... I think they just assume\nit's perhaps worse than it is.\nNeurological involvement\nBoth low back pain sufferers and non-sufferers rarely\ncame across this term. A few understood it to have some-\nthing to do with nerves or nerve endings. Most respond-\nents immediately mentioned heads and brains;\n\"Something's going wrong in your head.\"\nSome thought that neurological referred to the brain and\noften pointed to the base of the skull while explaining it.\nBecause it all stems from the brain doesn't it ... I think\nnerves because I think the brain ... your whole spinal cord\nruns up there doesn't it so your main nervous system runs\nup your back.\nNeurological involvement was one of the most alarming\nof the terms used. To some, it even suggested the possibil-\nity of imminent death.\nWhen your heads involved you start worrying don't you.\nDeath within six months.\nCould be a tumour.\nOsteopaths, chiropractors and GPs said that they did not\nuse the term neurological to explain pain to patients. This\nwas not because they felt it might alarm the patient, but\nbecause it was not seen as useful without a diagnosis.\nIt's not necessary. It doesn't add anything to the descriptors\nthat we're already using. It's too vague really.\nPhysiotherapists did use the phrase but stress that they\nalways explained it, for example, in terms of loss of sensa-\ntion. Neurological deficit was mentioned in the Physio-\ntherapist group as preferable to involvement because it is\nmore accurate.\nTrapped nerve\nTrapped nerve was a very common phrase used by the lay\nparticipants, yet was poorly understood. Explanations\nwere diverse. The lay participants described it as nerves\nstuck between bones or vertebral discs. For some this\nmeant it was more serious, and for others, less serious. For\nsome it involved 'inflammation'; for others, it meant no\nmore than leading to pins and needles.\nI don't know because none of these things have ever been sat\nand explained. It's just things that you perceive yourself.\nCommonly, trapped nerve was interpreted as either the\nsame as, or related to sciatica.\nFor health professionals, the term trapped nerve was\nintroduced by patients rather than by themselves.\nIt's one patients come in with a lot and you have to quantify\nto them exactly what a trapped nerve is to them so theyPage 6 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/123don't use it again ... It's another misnomer really, a bit like\na slipped disc.\nHealth professionals were concerned that the term made\nthe person's condition sound very serious and potentially\nuntreatable or permanent.\nI don't (use it). I tend to say nerve root irritation. Again I\nthink trapped nerve sounds a bit drastic and negative ...\nirritation's something that can be alleviated or eliminated.\nSome felt that trapped nerve can also be a 'catch all' cause\nof back pain, and sometimes they would have to correct a\npatient's understanding of it.\nYou might correct it sometimes when people talk about ...\nhaving their trapped nerve which implies that it can't move\nand nothing can be done and you might just explain that\nit's probably a nerve that has some pressure on it and then\ndiscuss the different causes of pressure and some may be\nalleviated easily and some may not.\nOsteopaths discussed how the term trapped can mislead\npatients by suggesting that an expert must separate the\nbones to un-trap the nerve. GPs were concerned that\ntrapped sounded unduly threatening and at the same time\ndemanded detailed, lengthy and unnecessary explanation\nand so was avoided by some GPs although patients\nwanted to use it.\nI've often avoided the phrase trapped nerve because they\nwant to know exactly what's trapping it and if it's serious.\nWear and tear\nThis was a commonly used and heard phrase for the lay\nparticipants in relation to low back pain. It was inter-\npreted as the back \"wearing out\" or \"being worn out\" by age,\nwork or sport. It was also described as \"general disintegra-\ntion\" of discs or bones; part of the natural process of get-\nting old. In the extreme it could be seen as meaning\n\"rotting away\".\nWear and tear makes me think that something's actually\ndiminishing. So, like a bone is getting thinner or a muscle\nis wearing thinner. It's shrinkage and it's unnatural. So\nthat's what I think of wear and tear - something's rotting\naway.\nTo the lay participants, this suggested there was no treat-\nment and that you just have to live with it. \"Degenerative\nchange\" was recognised as an alternative to wear and tear\nand was defined as progressively getting worse.\nNo I wouldn't necessarily say age ... I think it might just be\nyou've got one of those things. Like with arthritis it never\ngets better, it just gets worse.\nThere was also a perception that nothing could be done to\ntreat degenerative change. There were two very different\nemotional responses to a diagnosis of wear and tear Some\nwere relieved that their pain was due to wear and tear and\nwas not something \"more serious.\"\nI'd feel relieved actually ... relieved it's nothing. I haven't\ngot to have an operation, there's totally nothing wrong with\nme.\nHowever, the majority of lay participants said that a diag-\nnosis of wear and tear would result in negative thoughts: I\nhave to put up with this for the rest of my life as there is\nno treatment; it can only get worse; I am being fobbed off\nfor wasting the doctor's time; I am disappointed to have\nno diagnosis; I am getting old before my time.\nIt's like they're taking the piss ... doctor sits there \"Oh, it's\njust wear and tear.\"...It's quite condescending really isn't it\nwhen they say that? Especially when you're suffering\nOsteopaths said that they used wear and tear rather than\ndegeneration, thinking that it was kinder than arthritis or\ndegeneration. Similarly Chiropractors and Physiothera-\npists use wear and tear though some insist it be accompa-\nnied by an explanation of how wear and tear or arthritis is\nnot necessarily serious and that something can be done.\n...if you are describing wear and tear you must also say\nthat's ok you've got this condition but we can do something\nto improve it.\nGPs did use the phrase but replace it with more medical\nor technical terms, such as degenerative spine disease, for\n'sick notes' or medical notes.\nArthritis\nMany of the lay participants had never heard of arthritis in\nthe context of back pain. Although the term was familiar\nin relation to other joints and in the elderly, knowledge of\nspecific pathology is limited. Participants who had experi-\nenced back pain described it as: inflammation of the\njoints; bones rubbing together; crystallisation of the fluid\nin joints. Arthritis in backs was as particularly serious and\nworrying; \"it means you're in big trouble\". It was consid-\nered incurable, untreatable and progressive, and would be\nparticularly concerning for young people.\nIt'll get worse...you're diagnosed with that as you get older\nit's going to get worse and more painful ... There's not a lot\nof treatment for it that works.\nHealth professionals were aware that arthritis could alarm\npatients, who might think that it was more serious than it\noften is.Page 7 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/123We don't often use arthritis ... without specifically describ-\ning ... we have to go into a lot of detail to try and help people\nstop being anxious, because they come in terribly anxious,\ndon't they?\nSome physiotherapists use the term because their patients\nare likely to hear it from other professional, and took the\nopportunity to explain arthritis and any likely treatment\nfor it. Most preferred to use the phrase wear and tear.\nArthritis sounds like it's ill health and it's serious and a bit\nof wear and tear sounds just like living on this planet and\nnormal and everybody in the room's got a bit. If somebody\ncomes in and says they've got arthritis they're usually a bit\nmore worried.\nChiropractors similarly avoid arthritis in favour of wear\nand tear or degeneration as perceived to be less alarming.\nOftentimes people don't want to hear they've got arthritis.\n...Sometimes, people say the doctor's told me I've got arthri-\ntis and you say it's wear and tear it's normal ageing process\nthey're quite relieved by that.\nOsteopaths criticised those who used the word arthritis\nwithout an investigative diagnosis, and did not to use the\nterm.\nBut they'll come away and I'll say \"How do they know\nyou've got arthritis?\" \"Oh, the doctor told me\". \"How does\nhe know; did they do the blood test, did they do anything?\"\nNo, he just told me I had.\" ... they just tend to use it some-\ntimes and we have to sometimes look at them and say well\nI don't see any arthritis I don't know where they've got that\nfrom.\nExercise and activity\nFor the lay participants, exercise and activity have distinct\nmeanings and may infer these meanings upon the words\nused by professionals. Exercise is seen as a planned organ-\nised programme either for specific back strengthening or\ntraining or general working out at a gym for example.\nWhereas activity means day to day movement, moving\nabout normally, such as walking.\nExercise is always planned as opposed to activity (which is)\njust normal movement.\nI think exercise is when you specifically go out to do like\nswim, go to the gym, workout. Whereas activity is your gen-\neral activity during the day and how active you are...\nSome professionals, but not all, believe exercise to be sim-\nilar to activity and use the terms interchangeably.\nYou could use general exercise or general activity it means\nmore or less the same thing.\nThere's prescribed exercise for your back and then there's\nexercises like walking and swimming but not jogging ...\nactivity is anything...other than sitting in a chair or lying\ndown ... activity implies normal lifestyle.\n(GPs)\nSee Table 3 for a summary for all the terms discussed and\nthe categories into which the terms were placed.\nDiscussion\nLay participants understood the majority of the terms\nexplored in the group differently to the health profession-\nals. The words discussed were often not understood or\nwere misconstrued and many had inadvertent negative\nconnotations or implications. Although aware of some of\nthe ways in which patients may misunderstand words, the\nhealth professionals were unaware of some important\neffects words had on lay people. In this study, two differ-\nent pictures of back pain language and consultation dis-\ncussions emerged. The health professional groups showed\nawareness of the difficulties in communicating with back\npain patients using language and reported their efforts\nand the strategies used to address them. The lay partici-\npants generally did not feel that health professionals ade-\nquately explained terms and back pain in an\nunderstandable way. The findings indicate difficulties\nexist in the communication between professional and lay\nperceptions and understanding regarding back pain lan-\nguage and identify the need for further work designed to\naddress this gap.\nStrengths and limitations of the study\nThe sampling approach enabled us to select groups which\npurposefully informed our knowledge of our question\narea [14] and allowing us to explore a wide range of views\nfor this early research. However, the study sample was\ndrawn from English speakers from one geographical area\nand it is accepted that regional and language variations\nmay exist and influence the findings. It is considered a\nstrength of this study that a wide range of health profes-\nsionals and lay participants were included. Since there is\nlittle previous research in this area we believed this\nbreadth to be necessary to identify and raise relevant\nissues. However, this means that each professional group\nwas represented by only one focus group one so the find-\nings are not generalisable or representative of the profes-\nsions involved in this research. Rather, the interesting\ndifferences and perspectives emerging regarding from the\nprofessional groups are considered as interesting ques-\ntions to inform future work. Also, the professions in this\nstudy were chosen due to their high spinal workload andPage 8 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/123it is acknowledged that other professions have back pain\npatients and may use different terms and language.\nLanguage is a component of the larger structure of com-\nmunication but, whilst there are many studies emphasiz-\ning the importance of verbal behaviours for effective\nhealth professional-patient communication [15,16], there\nis little research directly assessing the importance of the\nlanguage used. This may be because language is consid-\nered so personal, cultural, variable and non generalisable\nwhilst key elements of communication, such as non ver-\nbal communication have wider applicability. The impor-\ntance of specific language terms and the resulting\nconnotations of words used for specific patient popula-\ntions are however acknowledged [17]; Abramsky and\nFletcher [17] concluded that the choice of words used to\ninform members of the public about prenatal diagnostic\ncounselling may significantly affect how a genetic condi-\ntion or risk is perceived. Cedraschi et al [7] demonstrated\nthe presence of a discrepancy between the theory and\npractice of the word 'chronic' and the possible misunder-\nstandings that the word could produce. They conclude,\nand this study agrees, that the widespread use of a word\ncan erroneously encourage the belief that everyone is talk-\ning on common ground and attributing the same mean-\ning. As Klaber Moffett et al. [18] opine, why do health\nprofessionals, who know the power of words to harm,\nhelp and promote change, pay so little attention to the\nactual words we use? The impact of simple changes, using\nlong term rather than chronic for example, seemed evi-\ndent in the lay member groups. Whether by increasing the\nawareness of health professionals regarding the under-\nstanding of existing terms the language gap can suffi-\nciently be addressed, or whether health professionals and\nlay people need to co-develop new terms is an area of fur-\nther research.\nThe importance and process of diagnosis was raised\nrepeatedly within groups though never raised by the mod-\nerator. Health professionals acknowledged that, whilst\npatients are keen to receive diagnoses, most importantly\nthey want treatment. Professionals appreciate that clear\ndiagnoses and diagnostic labels are not possible for many\nback pain patients [5]. However, as indicated in this study,\npatients may believe a diagnosis is a prerequisite for effec-\ntive treatment. Clear diagnoses are important; a recent\nreview has concluded that greater attention should be\npaid to discussing diagnoses and causes of back pain with\npatients [19]. The lack of clear diagnoses and causal expla-\nnations can adversely affect patients; promote prolonged\npatient dependency [20], cause frustration [21] and\nimpact upon patient compliance [5]. In this study,\npatients\/former patients wanted clear diagnoses while\nprofessionals noticed patients returning to ask further\n\"why, what\"? questions and seeking information. Back\npain is known to produce complex consultations; the lack\nof a definitive diagnostic test, fear of being labelled with\npsychological pain or as a malingerer, plus the need to\nprovide proof of suffering can all contribute to difficulties\nfrom the patient perspective [20]. Whilst health profes-\nsionals may wish to avoid conflict during consultations\nand find the application of recent research findings prob-\nlematic [22]. It is also likely that health professionals and\npatients perceive and recall diagnosis and information\nsharing differently; our study supports McIntosh and\nShaw's [21] qualitative study finding that patients report\nlittle evidence of receiving information from most health\nprofessionals although the latter all speak of providing\nsuch information. Barriers to information sharing clearly\nexist and finding the right words to use in health profes-\nsional- patient consultations is a challenge [5].\nIn this study professionals continued to use words with\npatients which they appreciated were problematic. Either\nbecause the patient introduced them and they wished to\nrespect the patient's language, because they lacked alterna-\ntive terms or because they believed that using the terms\nwith additional explanation surmounted the difficulties\ncreated by using a problem term. Ex-patients in this study\ndid not offer any examples where such explanations over-\ncame the effects of a poorly perceived term but this infor-\nmation was not specifically sought. While the health\nprofessionals in this study believed providing patients\nwith information is integral to practice [21], a language\ngap seems evident. Health professionals should not\nassume that simple terms are necessarily better and\nshould be aware that the use of a widespread term does\nnot ensure patients and clinicians understanding it simi-\nlarly. Commonly used terms may be misunderstood and\nhave a negative impact upon patients. Furthermore there\nis a need for further dialogue between health profession-\nals and patients regarding how present language gaps may\nbe addressed.\nConclusion\nThis preliminary research explores the clinically impor-\ntant, though scarcely researched, area of the language of\nback pain. Few of the existing medical terms included in\nthis qualitative study were understood and accepted by lay\nparticipants in the way discussed and expected by health\nprofessionals. Examples of misunderstandings, unin-\ntended meanings and negative emotional responses to\nterms were found within the study focus groups. Health\ncare professionals were sensitive and alert to the issues\nand reported the efforts they make to minimise potential\nproblems caused by the presence of a language gap. As\npatient access to treatment notes and correspondence\nincreases in the UK, the impact of written terms, as well asPage 9 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/123Publish with BioMed Central   and  every \nscientist can read your work free of charge\n\"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for \ndisseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\"\nSir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK\nYour research papers will be:\navailable free of charge to the entire biomedical community\npeer reviewed and published immediately upon acceptance\ncited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central \nyours \u2014 you keep the copyright\nSubmit your manuscript here:\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/info\/publishing_adv.asp\nBioMedcentral\nverbal, needs careful consideration and attention.
