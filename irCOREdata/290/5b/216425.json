It also focuses attention on\nwho is not an autochthon but a \u2018stranger\u2019 and how to treat them (Shack\n1979). A hardening of identities around claims to belong is wedded to\na process of excluding outsiders. Over a decade ago Peter Geschiere\nand Josef Gugler (1998a: 309) edited an influential issue of Africa in\nwhich they argued that an \u2018increasing obsession with \u201cautochthony\u201d\nthroughout the continent . . . triggers a politics of belonging\u2019.\nThe politics of belonging has proved to be a powerful analytical\nframework with almost global application,1 but its African inflection\nMARTIN EVANS is a lecturer in International Development at the University of Chester.\nBesides the research in Cameroon recounted in this issue, he has been studying issues of\ncivil conflict, livelihoods and human displacement in Casamance, Senegal, for a decade.\nHis current interests there focus on the influence of international aid and insecurity on the\nrestructuring of local political space.\nBEN PAGE teaches geography at University College London. His research interests address\nnature, society and migration. He has carried out research in Cameroon since the mid-1990s,\nmostly in the South-West and North-West provinces and in collaboration with colleagues\nat the University of Buea. In that time he has published on the commodification of water,\ncommunity water management, the imagined geography of Whiteman Kontri, the politics of\nurban agriculture and, more recently, on the work of Cameroonian cultural and development\n(hometown) associations.\nCLAIRE MERCER is a Lecturer in Human Geography in the Department of Geography and\nEnvironment at the London School of Economics. She writes about civil society in Tanzania,\nand associational life in the African diaspora.\n1Peter Geschiere\u2019s The Perils of Belonging (2009) illustrates the global salience of this\nframework by including a chapter on belonging in the Netherlands. For other work presented\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\n346 REVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING\nseems to have gained particular traction (Broch-Due 2005; Englund\nand Nyamnjoh 2004; Eyoh 1999; Kuba and Lentz 2006; Nyamnjoh\n2005; Schipper 1999). Evidence for this comes both from countries\nwhere nation building has been problematic, such as Cameroon\n(Ceuppens and Geschiere 2005), Zimbabwe (Hammer 2002) and\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (Marshall 2006), and those where it has been deemed\nrelatively successful, such as in Botswana (Nyamnjoh 2006, 2007),\nSouth Africa (Bangeni and Kapp 2005), Ghana and Burkina Faso\n(Lentz 2006, 2007a).\nBut how is this politics of belonging practised? In the Cameroonian\ncase the national government has been shown to have instrumentalized\nthe sentiments associated with home in its own interest (Eyoh 1998;\nFonchingong 2005; Gabriel 1999; P. Nkwi and Socpa 1997; W. Nkwi\n2006; Nyamnjoh 1999; Yenshu 2006). It does so in order to help\nsecure regional power bases and to undermine political rivals by\nnurturing localist movements and so pre-empting the emergence of any\nideologically coherent opposition (Geschiere 2004). Thus the rise of\nthe importance of autochthony was closely associated with the rise of\nmulti-party politics; it emerged as an opportunistic strategy by which\nthe effect of democratic innovations could be annulled. The resulting\nethno-territorialization of national politics risks overturning gains in\npromoting national-level identity, as a rural Africa of fictive ethnic\nhomelands becomes \u2018the mainspring of xenophobias and destructive\nsubnationalisms\u2019 (Boone 2003: 1). From the perspective of local\nelites, this politics can be used to mask or justify interventions in\nbaser local material conflicts. For example, where population densities\nare high, fertile land is scarce and agriculture provides a degree of\nsecurity, the language of belonging can license land disputes. Where\ncentral state resources are distributed in relation to bureaucratic\ninstitutions (such as MPs or via divisional headquarters) the language\nof belonging can permit claims to be made for a new parliamentary\nconstituency or some other government space. The politics of\nbelonging in Cameroon sanctions the establishment to pursue their\ninterests.\nKey contributions in this area (Geschiere and Nyamnjoh 1998, 2000,\n2001; Konings 2001; Ndjio 2006; Nyamnjoh and Rowlands 1998)\nhighlighted the spatial variability of the politics of belonging across\nCameroon. They also drew attention to the elusive and treacherous\nnature of autochthony, which is \u2018subject to constant redefinition against\nnew \u201cothers\u201d and at ever-closer range\u2019 (Ceuppens and Geschiere\n2005: 385). This iterative process of redefining who is an autochthon\nunder the banner of \u2018the politics of belonging\u2019 outside Africa see Castles and Davidson 2000;\nCroucher 2004; Crowley 1999; Dieckhoff 2004; Fortier 2000; Gilroy 2005; Ignatieff 1996;\nSavage et al. 2005; Westwood and Phizacklea 2000; Yuval Davis 2003, 2004, 2006. While\nthe earliest published reference we can find for the phrase is Margaret Roff\u2019s The Politics of\nBelonging: political change in Sabah and Sarawak (1974), its extraordinary recent proliferation\nin the social sciences seems to date from around 1998. Writing on Africa seems to have played\na very prominent role in the development of this framework.\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\nREVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING 347\nbinds people into \u2018ever-diminishing circles\u2019 of deciding who really\nbelongs in any particular place (Nyamnjoh 2007). The illusory divisions\nrepresented in such dynamics \u2013what Englund (2004: 11) calls \u2018the\nspectre of discrete identities\u2019 \u2013 presume and encourage the construction\nof \u2018independent\u2019 ethno-territorial entities, each pursuing its own\nagenda within the nation. Such a drift into parochialism is potentially\ndangerous because of the \u2018epistemological and ideological vacuity\nof the discourse of \u201cbelonging\u201d\u2019 (Hickey 2004: 11), an emptiness\nthat the unscrupulous can fill with ethnic chauvinism or other\nsectarian notions. All too often a politics of belonging is divisive and\ndystopian.\nThe central concern of the three articles presented as a group here\nis that such strong claims about home, belonging and politics are\noften difficult to reconcile with the much hazier reality observed on\nthe ground in Cameroon. This blurring of belonging often stems from\nthe fact that the relationship between people and place is not always\nparamount in the way individuals imagine themselves. The \u2018identity\u2019 of\nany individual often draws on other territories and on gender, kinship,\nreligion, profession and education, as well as a rural \u2018ethnic homeland\u2019\n(Mohan 2006). Actually-existing \u2018homes\u2019 are often experienced as\nmultiple and mobile and are based on a complex calculus of family,\nethnicity, language, lifecourse and work. In the literature on belonging,\nhome is often physically located as the prospective burial place (Gugler\n2002), but this definition risks becoming self-validating as the wish to\nbe buried at \u2018home\u2019 appears to have grown stronger as the language\nof the politics of belonging has become entrenched \u2013 providing the\nlens through which to view these ceremonies (Geschiere 2005; Jua\n2005; Mazzucato et al. 2006; Page 2007). The notions of \u2018primary\npatriotism\u2019 (Geschiere and Gugler 1998b) or \u2018local patriotism\u2019 (van\nden Bersselaar 2005: 54) demonstrate that this analytical framework\nhas always been aware that individuals sustain multiple patriotisms\nalongside their loyalty to a rural home. Against this diverse background\nof obligations the political leverage that can be derived from calling on\nautochthony starts to look less effective.\nWhilst it would be perverse to ignore the horrors that have been\nlicensed elsewhere by elite discourses of autochthony (for example\nin C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), the aim in these articles is at least to disturb\nany inevitable or overly tidy segue between belonging and political\nsegmentation in Cameroon. Too often the existing literature moves too\nquickly to an analysis that foregrounds the worrisome dimensions of a\npolitics of belonging, thus leaving little space for other interpretations.\nUndoubtedly the increased emphasis placed on \u2018home\u2019 is an empirically\ndiscernible process with significant material impacts, but the more\nthat observers look for evidence of autochthony, the more they will\nfind \u2013 and, as a result, what they find may shade out other equally\nmeaningful stories about home and belonging.\nPaying attention to other ways in which to analyse affiliations to\nhome (for example, by foregrounding forms of cooperation and the\nachievements of local solidarity) does not mean ignoring the reasonable\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\n348 REVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING\nanxieties about the social risks associated with a national politics that\nvalidates autochthony. Work over the last decade provides abundant\nevidence of social segmentation and other \u2018perils of belonging\u2019\n(Geschiere 2009). However, the history of many places can be read\nin terms of belonging (with its implications of division) or in terms of\nconviviality (with its implications of living peaceably with difference\nand of amalgamation), or both (Dafinger and Pelican 2006). Stories\nof collaboration across social differences are no less vulnerable to\nexploitation by cynical politicians than stories of autochthony, but\ndrawing attention to those interpretations is the first step in articulating\nthe possibility of \u2018a progressive politics of place\u2019 (Massey 1993, 1994).\nAfter this introduction, this article uses a case study of a boundary\ndispute in Mezam, North-West Cameroon to continue to develop this\ntheme of the tension between belonging and conviviality. The two\narticles that follow this are based on studies of home associations (more\nusually named \u2018cultural and development associations\u2019 in Cameroon or\n\u2018hometown associations\u2019 in the literature). Existing analyses argue that\nthese associations are an instrument of power and a crucial tool in the\npolitics of belonging that links urban elites to their rural homelands.\nThe rise of elite home associations reflects a national politics of self-\nserving political entrepreneurs and regional elites seeking personal\nplatforms and the approval of the ruling party bureaucracy (Bayart\n1993; Mbuagbo and Akoko 2004). In contrast, the articles presented\nhere join a small literature that has viewed the contemporary work of\nhome associations in more sympathetic light, either because they assert\nmeaningful political rights (Hickey 2002, 2007; Lentz 2007b; Pelican\n2008) or because they deliver improved goods and services (Kabki\net al. 2004; Mercer et al. 2008; Yenshu 2008). Evans\u2019s article explores\nideas about how home associations linked to Manyu in the South-\nWest Province could potentially contribute to a new form of nation\nbuilding (emerging from below) in Cameroon. It suggests that they\nare not necessarily a barrier to cohesion because they can be sites\nfor civic engagement and citizenship formation. Feldman-Savelsberg\nand Ndonko\u2019s article draws attention to the importance of gender\nand status in these debates. By looking at Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 women\u2019s home\nassociation and non-elite home associations it emphasizes the partiality\nof the view that results from treating male elites\u2019 associations as\nemblematic of the hometown association\u2019s influence in the politics\nof belonging. Their article draws attention to the diverse meanings\nof \u2018home\u2019 for different types of home associations \u2013 and in particular\nmakes it clear that the idea of home as a \u2018refuge\u2019 is only one of these\nmeanings.\nTHE BALI\u2013BAWOCK CRISIS OF 2006\u20137\nIn early December 2006 government surveyors began work physically\ndemarcating the boundary between Bali Subdivision and Santa\nSubdivision in Mezam Division, in Anglophone north-west Cameroon\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\nREVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING 349\nFIGURE 1 Mezam Division, North-West Province\n(Figure 1).

The\nsurveyors were obliged to call in the forces of law and order to extricate\n2This account of the dispute between Bali and Bawock is not based on first-hand fieldwork\nin Cameroon at the time of the \u2018crisis\u2019. We have drawn on fieldwork carried out in 2005\n(including interviews with both the Fon of Bali and the Fon of Bawock). The account\ndeveloped here also relies (1) on information sent to us in early 2007 by a research assistant\nin Bali; (2) on information provided to us by the Bali diaspora in the UK throughout 2007;\n(3) on discussions with Bali elites and other informed commentators in Buea in December\n2007; and (4) on published sources. Most of the published sources were accessed online and\ninclude the statement of the Fon of Bali\u2019s Traditional Council (which was until relatively\nrecently available on the website of the Bali-Nyonga Development and Cultural Association),\ninterviews conducted by Cameroonian journalists and published in the Cameroonian press,\nand comments and internet discussion groups.\n3The subdivision is called Bali, the main town of the subdivision is referred to as Bali\nTown, and the dominant identity within the subdivision describe themselves as Bali-Nyonga,\nin order to distinguish themselves from other Bali groups (such as Baligham and Balikumbat)\nliving elsewhere in the North-West Province. All these different Bali groups claim a shared\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\n350 REVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING\nthemselves from the m\u00eal\u00e9e and the boundary demarcation exercise was\nabandoned.\nDespite cohabitation and intermarriage with neighbours for over\na century, Bawock village is now often perceived to be significantly\ndifferent from the villages surrounding it, both those in Bali and those\nin Santa. Around 1905 a group of people moved from the town of\nBangant\u00e9 (some 60 miles away) in Nd\u00e9 Division in the southern part\nof the Francophone West Province (Figure 1, inset) to the area of\nBawock (Chilver 1964). Increasingly in recent years the village has\nemphasized its historic connections with Bangant\u00e9. For example, it\nhas sent dance groups to participate in cultural events in the West\nProvince and campaigned for a bilingual secondary school in Bawock\nteaching in both English and French. Most of the population of Bawock\nare Anglophone, but they are happy to identify with French speakers\n(for example, their public signage puts French first and their Fon\nsometimes chooses to speak in French during public meetings). In so\ndoing they signify affinity to the predominantly Francophone national\nadministration and also assert their claim to minority status. These\nstrategies are symptomatic of the national political climate in Cameroon\nwith their emphasis on \u2018true\u2019 ethnic homelands and ideas of who is a\nson or daughter of the soil.\nBut the differences between Bawock and its neighbours are mostly\norganized around ideas of ethnicity. Most people in Bawock now\nidentify themselves as Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9. Most people in Bali Subdivision\nidentify themselves as Bali Nyonga, whilst the Santa Council describes\nits Subdivision as \u2018a melting pot of ethnic groups\u2019 comprising Ngemba,\nMoghamo, Chamba, Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 and Mbororo elements (Santa Council\n2008).4 However (with the exception of the small numbers of Chamba,\nBamil\u00e9k\u00e9 and Mbororo) the different groups in Santa all claim to share\na common Widikum origin. There are, then, three key ethnicities that\nare becoming crystallized in the telling of this story: Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9, Bali\nNyonga and Widikum.\nDuring interviews in 2005 the Fon of Bawock (the \u2018traditional ruler\u2019)\nclaimed that his people had been given their land when another group\n(the BaTi) left Bali in 1911. He also claimed that the villages of Mbu\nand Pinyin (in Santa) had always been their immediate neighbours.5\nThe village of Mantum (the Fon of Bawock argued) had been created\nafter that time by Bali Nyonga in an attempt to take land from\nBawock, and the sub-chief of Mantum had been installed to support\nthis claim. In contrast the people living in Mantum claimed that theirs\nwas a Bali Nyonga village that lay between Bawock and Mbu, so that\nBawock had no direct boundary with Santa Subdivision. From the\nBali perspective, the boundary-drawing exercise was a covert attempt\nChamba genealogy, though since the Bali-Nyonga are the largest of these groups they\nsometimes just describe themselves as Bali.\n4On ethnicity and citizenship among the Mbororo see Dafinger and Pelican 2006; Hickey\n2007.\n5Fon of Bawock, Bawock, 2 March and 6 March 2005.\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\nREVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING 351\nby Bawock to acquire land at the expense of Bali Nyonga. As the\nBali Traditional Council put it, it is as if \u2018Lesotho would be asking\nthat a boundary be demarcated between herself and Namibia on the\none hand and between herself and Botswana on the other hand and\npretending that there is no South African Territory between\u2019 (Bali\nNyonga Development and Cultural Association 2008). It also claimed\nthat an important Bali Nyonga shrine is located at the Ntsi-Su\u2019fu\nstream, which runs through the disputed land. The flags used in the\nannual Lela dance (the most important ceremony in the Bali Nyonga\ncalendar) are ritually washed at this shrine (Fardon 2006). According\nto the Fon of Bali, access to this site had been an issue for some\nyears:\nEvery year we have tension with Bawock over the Lela shrine. I am\nembarrassed that one group who came to settle in Bali are trying to insulate\nthemselves. The traditional ruler of Bawock pleaded that he be called Fon,\nso we call him Fon. Why do the Bawock people see themselves as separate?\nWe don\u2019t want them to be Bali. We simply want them to allow us to use our\nshrine. (Fon of Bali, 15 March 2005)6\nThe Bali Traditional Council claims that the land had been given\nto Bawock not by the BaTi but by the Bali Nyonga people in the\nearly twentieth century. Since the Fon of Bawock was recognized as\na second-class chief within the first-class chiefdom of Bali Nyonga by\na government order,7 they claim authority over the Bawock land and\nargue that the Fon of Bali should have been involved in any boundary-\nmaking exercise, which in this case he was not \u2013 or at least not until a\nvery late stage.8 The Bali Nyonga felt that they were being deliberately\nexcluded from the demarcation exercise through the machinations of\nthe Fon of Bawock, who was being led astray either by Widikum\ninterests in Santa Subdivision or by those in West Province, or by\npersons in the Bawock diaspora overseas. The uncharacteristic alacrity\nwith which government officials had responded to the appeal for a\nboundary-marking exercise from the Fons of Bawock, Pinyin and Mbu\nwas evidence to those in Bali Nyonga that there was some foul play\nor corruption at work. After the skirmish in Mantum all the traditional\nrulers appealed for calm, and their instructions were obeyed for a while.\nThree months later, in early March 2007, there was further conflict\nbetween Bali Nyonga and Bawock. Again, the basic facts of the story\nare contested. According to the Fon of Bawock and his representatives,\non 3 March a Voma group (a Bali Nyonga cult who perform fertility\nrites associated with the agricultural year)9 entered Bawock land.

Its presence in Bali\nNyonga has ebbed and flowed. Major annual Voma celebrations take place at the end of the\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\n352 REVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING\nclaimed that the ceremony performed by the Voma continued inside\nBawock land, despite the tension between the two groups that had\nfollowed the events of the previous December. The people in Bawock\nviewed this as an attempt to taunt them by asserting Bali ownership\nof their land. Various Bawock sources describe this as effectively a\ndeclaration of war by Bali Nyonga on Bawock. On the other hand\n(according to the Fon of Bali Nyonga\u2019s Traditional Council) the Voma\nalways comes out annually at the start of the farming season to bless\nthe farmlands in order to ensure good yields and on this occasion it\nwas on its way back to Bali Town from Mantum and was passing\nthrough Bawock along the main road. Bali accounts suggest that the\ngroup accompanying Voma was attacked by youths from Bawock who\nseized the sacred Voma bag and burnt it. This was interpreted in Bali\nNyonga as an act of desecration and a declaration of war by the Bawock\non Bali Nyonga.\nOn 5March there was a fire in the Fon\u2019s palace in Bali Town, starting\nat around 4.30 a.m. According to Bali Nyonga accounts this was an\narson attack by a group from Bawock who threw a petrol bomb onto\nthe grass roof of a holy shrine (the Chum) attached to the palace. Parts\nof this building had originally been constructed in 1889 and it was used\nto store a number of the Fon\u2019s sacred and secular treasures. The palace\ngong brought the people of Bali Town out to fight the fire, but palace\nofficials maintain that, despite their efforts, the building and its contents\nwere destroyed.\nThe next day around 300 buildings in Bawock were razed to the\nground, livestock was butchered and crops destroyed. Government\ntroops were brought into Bali and Bawock to control the situation and\nprevent further violence. According to Bali Nyonga accounts, the Fon\nof Bali urged restraint on the morning after the fire and his people\nresponded to that appeal. They claim that the Bawock people torched\ntheir own homes and then made themselves refugees in order to cast\nsuspicion onto the people of Bali Nyonga. This was said to be a\nreplication of the strategy used by the BaTi people against Bali Nyonga\nin 1911. According to Bawock accounts (and most press reports) a\ngroup of youths from Bali Nyonga seeking revenge for the fire at\ntheir palace attacked the village of Bawock. They destroyed property,\nlooted stored food and commodities, and forced the Bawock people\nto leave their homes and flee. By the end of the day between 500 and\n5,000 people from Bawock had fled the village and large numbers of\nthem stayed away for several weeks.10 Ultimately around 2,200 people\ndry season though the society performs rituals and ceremonies throughout the year, notably in\nOctober and in January\u2013February when it celebrates the festival of \u2018first fruits\u2019 and the closing\nof the Voma year, known as vomnunga\u2019a. For more on the political organization of Bali see\nChilver and Kaberry 1961 and TintaNji et al. 1988.\n10Estimates of how many people fled vary considerably. Accounts are also unclear\nabout who fled where, and at what point they started to return to Bawock. See\n< http:\/\/www.postnewsline.com\/2007\/03\/bawock_refugees.html>, accessed 29 March 2010.\nRecent council statistics from Bali suggest that Bawock had a population of 5,341 inhabitants\nprior to these events.\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\nREVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING 353\nformed a \u2018refugee camp\u2019 in the Bamenda Congress Hall, the main\npublic building in the centre of the provincial urban headquarters,\nwhere they received official and charitable aid.11\nAfter some time the people of Bawock began to return to their village\nand the process of rebuilding began. This has been assisted by those\nwho see the Bawock people as a victimized minority in the Subdivision\nwho were overpowered by Bali Nyonga aggression. However, attempts\nhave also been made by the people of Bali Nyonga to offer support to\nBawock as a gesture of reconciliation under the guidance of their Fon.\nBali Nyonga found little support from neighbours in the 2007\ncrisis. Current relations between Bali Nyonga and its neighbours are\nprofoundly affected by the events of the early colonial era (Chilver\n1967). In the two decades around the year 1900 Bali Nyonga was\na sub-imperial power within the Grassfields12 because of an alliance\nwith German colonialists. In 1891 the Germans trained a \u2018Balitruppe\u2019\nand armed them with breechloading rifles, enabling them to achieve\ndominance over neighbouring polities. In 1905 the Fon of Bali\nwas recognized by the Germans as regional paramount chief. The\nconsequence of the alliance was a long history of animosity between\nthe Bali Nyonga and their neighbours. Not only are the Bali Nyonga\naccused of using their power to acquire more land, but they are also\naccused of being directly involved in the supply of forced labour from\ntheir neighbours for work on the German plantations on the coast\n(Chilver and R\u00f6schenthaler 2002).\nFrom the perspective of the Bali Nyonga elites the sympathy within\nNorth-West Province for Bawock and the animosity towards Bali\nNyonga appear to have come as a shock. Speaking at a subsequent\nannual general meeting of the Bali Nyonga Development and Cultural\nAssociation, the outgoing President-General commented:\nThe recent Bawock crisis revealed the actual depth of feeling against\nus throughout Mezam. For although we had clearly acted in legitimate\nretribution, we were still vehemently condemned, with a fanatical bias that\nwas totally inconsistent with the love of truth and fairness that was once the\nhallmark of this Province. And much as the violence of the propaganda came\nas something of a surprise, it also confirmed what we have always suspected:\nthat when the chips are down, we in Bali have no one but ourselves to count\non. And for that reason, we have a duty to stick together and be doubly\nvigilant.\nThe tone of wounded surprise is somewhat disingenuous given the\nwidespread consciousness of Bali history and their self-ascribed martial\nidentity, but the sentiment is absolutely of the current moment in\nCameroonian political rhetoric.\n11UNHCR, Cameroon Tribune, 12 March 2007.\n12This term is used to describe the area covering large parts of the West and North-West\nProvinces and a small part of the South-West Province.

It is a conflict about claims over who belongs where, who\nhas the right to call a particular place their homeland, and who gets\nto write the most widely accepted story of particular events. It welds\ntogether questions about land ownership, home, ethnicity and history.\nRival claims over scarce resources (land) are being justified using\nideas of ethnic rights over particular territories. Competition over the\nboundaries of parliamentary constituencies are also in the background\nin this dispute, with the Santa-Bali constituency ultimately being split\nto give Santa its own seat, while Bali has been appended to a Bamenda\nseat. The experience for those caught up in these politics is of increased\ninsularity and inward-looking social relations \u2013 the outcome of these\nevents is the conclusion that \u2018we\u2019 can only trust \u2018ourselves\u2019. When\nJohn Crawly described the politics of belonging as the \u2018 \u201cdirty work\u201d\nof boundary maintenance\u2019 (Crawly 1999: 30) he probably did not\nenvisage the boundary in this literal sense, but his definition perfectly\ncaptures the events described. In this instance the reification of social\nboundaries in contemporary Cameroon is materialized through a battle\nover real territorial boundaries. But in what ways does this case study\nsuggest that the character of the politics of belonging has changed over\nthe last ten years?\nFirst, as time passes the metaphor of \u2018ever-diminishing circles\u2019 to\ndescribe these politics increasingly seems less apt than the idea of \u2018the\nground being taken from under your feet\u2019. An imagined geography of\nCameroon in which there is a drift towards smaller and smaller units,\neach containing \u2018true\u2019 autochthons, has become harder to sustain as the\nyears have passed. This is particularly the case in parts of the country\n(such as the North-West and West) where there has been considerable\nmobility over the last two centuries. Foregrounding belonging has not\nproduced a reordering of the population into a static one-dimensional\n\u2018map\u2019 of homelands; rather, it has generated a sense of the strata\nof belonging. The search for the true owner of land will often be\nfruitless because, as Carola Lentz says, \u2018land rights have always been\nambiguous, negotiable and politically embedded, in the pre-colonial\npast just as under the colonial regime and in present times\u2019 (Lentz 2006:\n34). The idea of the search for the authentic owner of the land rests on\na false idea of the past as both static and separate from the present. Her\nargument is only amplified by recognizing the anachronism of speaking\nof these ethnic identities in the pre-colonial past as if these labels carried\nthe same meaning as those operating today.\nThe Bali Nyonga claim that they gave the people of Bawock their\nhomeland and that therefore Bawock is both geographically within and\npolitically under Bali Nyonga rule. Yet Bali historians make no secret\nof the fact that they themselves are not the original inhabitants of the\nterritory they call their homeland. Before this place was Bali it was\nMeta and the Bali Nyonga make their claim to ownership of the land\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\nREVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING 355\nthrough an act of appropriation in the mid-nineteenth century.13 The\nBali Nyonga are themselves widely perceived to be relative latecomers\nto the Grassfields. A reply to a newspaper article perfectly captures this\nwidely held sentiment:\nthe Balis were the last ethnic group to move into the graffiland (Northwest\nand Western province) and are a group of the Chamba people ([from\nthe] Extreme North province and part of Nigeria). The Bamilekes (from\nAdamawa), Bamouns and Banso (from Adamawa), Tikars and Balis moved\ninto this region in that respective order and the Balis were hosted by the\nBamouns [and] Bamilekes before they moved up to the NW.14\nThe accuracy of this account can be contested, but its importance is\nthat it is pervasive. It even implicitly introduces the idea that the Bali\nNyonga are not really Cameroonian because their \u2018Chamba cradle\u2019 is in\npresent-day Nigeria. If (as some Bali Nyonga elites suggested in the heat\nof the crisis) the Bawock people belonged \u2018back\u2019 in the West Province,\nthen others (Bali Nyonga\u2019s critics) could equally argue that the people\nof Bali Nyonga belonged \u2018back\u2019 in Nigeria with the other Chambas.\nFurthermore, other influential groups in the region (such as those from\nBamoun or Banso, or who claim a Tikar genealogy) know that their\nclaims to be autochthons stand in contradiction to their claims to have\noriginally come from elsewhere. As time has passed there is a greater\nconsciousness of the risks of claiming the status of autochthons.\nA second difference relates to the increasing importance of\nCameroonian diaspora groups to local politics at home (Mercer\net al. 2008). Discussions about the Bali\u2013Bawock dispute between Bali\nNyonga individuals in Cameroon, the USA, Western Europe and Asia\nalmost universally showed unquestioning support for the Bali side. The\nonly Bali Nyonga criticism of Bali Nyonga actions at home tended\nto be cast in a rather moralistic Christian register. In addition some\nmembers of the diaspora have very specific anxieties related to land\ninheritance and this provides an incentive for direct involvement in\ndisputes. However, interviews among the Bali Nyonga diaspora in the\nUK also show a weary frustration with Cameroonian politics. Whilst\ninterviewees clearly expressed their sympathy for those in Bali Nyonga\nduring the dispute, they were also more cynical about the way in which\nevents there were being manipulated by some Bali Nyonga elites out\nof personal interest and for party political purposes. They expressed\nanxieties about the structural conditions of Cameroonian politics that\nmade the resolution of land disputes very difficult and acted as a barrier\nto reconciliation.\n13There is another peril here too, though it has never been articulated to us in these terms\nin Cameroon. If a past act of appropriation can ensure subsequent \u2018belonging\u2019, then logically\nanother act of appropriation in the present or future will also presumably be an acceptable\nmeans of asserting ownership.\n14Comment (20 March 2007) in response to an article in The Post newspaper,\n< http:\/\/www.postnewsline.com\/2007\/03\/bawock_refugees.html>, accessed 21 July 2008.\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\n356 REVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING\nA third difference relates to multi-party democracy in Cameroon.\nWhereas opposition parties represented a significant challenge to the\nestablishment in Cameroon in the 1990s, they no longer do so. The\nelections of the 1990s had real meaning in Cameroon. Twelve years\non, the challenge presented by the political opposition has largely\nevaporated and the same elite who controlled the ruling party, the\nadministration and the main routes of economic accumulation in 1990\nare still in power now. In the most recent parliamentary elections\n(2007) opposition parties were reduced to 15 per cent of the seats,\nand some of those parties are overtly allied to the ruling party anyway\n(Table 1). Furthermore, if opposition parties do still retain a foothold\nin the legislature their power bases are highly localized and only the\nCameroon People\u2019s Democratic Movement (CPDM)15 can plausibly\nclaim a national mandate, having even recently taken seats such as\nJakiri in the Social Democratic Front\u2019s (SDF)16 heartland (Table 2).\nSo confident is the CPDM that it has now retrieved its political\nmonopoly in Cameroon that it is demanding that the 1996 constitution\nbe changed in order to allow President Paul Biya to run for election\nagain in 2011, when his second seven-year term ends.17 Such a\nchange would be a potent symbol of the evanescence of multi-party\npolitics in Cameroon, given that a limit of two presidential terms\nwas one of the opposition\u2019s main tangible outcomes after protests\nin the 1990s. A bill to amend the constitution was tabled in April\n2008. Street violence in urban centres across Cameroon in February\n2008 may partly reflect frustration with the arrogance of the political\nestablishment.\nThe argument made a decade ago was that the politics of belonging\nin Cameroon and elsewhere was a response to the rise of multi-party\ndemocracy:\nIn many parts of the continent democratisation seems to encourage the\nemergence of a particular form of politics, centred on regional elite\nassociations, as some sort of alternative to multi-partyism. (Geschiere and\nGugler 1998a: 309)\nThe idea that \u2018settlers\u2019 or \u2018strangers\u2019 might influence parliamentary\nrepresentation prompted an obsession with questions of origins. Since\nthe government of Cameroon associated settlers with opposition\npolitical parties it was happy to support home associations (unions\n15The CPDM is the ruling party in Cameroon.

Though it has not been co-opted by the CPDM, it has struggled with internal\nfactionalism.\n17Paul Biya became Prime Minister of Cameroon in 1975 and has been President since\n1982. He was re-elected during one-party rule in 1984 and 1988. He was then elected in\ndisputed multi-party elections in 1992. After the introduction of the 1996 constitution a limit\nwas placed on the number of Presidential terms that could be served. Paul Biya was re-elected\nunder this system in 1997 and 2004.\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\nREVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING 357\nTABLE 1 Legislative election results, 1992\u20132007\nCPDM SDF Other opposition\n1992 88 - 92\n1997 109 43 28\n2002 149 22 9\n2007 153 16 11\nSource: African Elections Database, \u3008http:\/\/africanelections.tripod.com\/index.html\u3009\nTABLE 2 Legislative election results by province, 2007\nCPDM SDF UNDP CDU PM\nAdamawa 9 0 1 0 0\nCentre 28 0 0 0 0\nEast 11 0 0 0 0\nFar North 28 0 1 0 0\nLittoral 17 1 0 0 1\nNorth 8 0 4 0 0\nNorth West 7 13 0 0 0\nWest 19 2 0 4 0\nSouth 11 0 0 0 0\nSouth West 15 0 0 0 0\nTOTAL 153 16 6 4 1\nSource: Cameroon Tribune\nPolitical parties: Cameroon People\u2019s Democratic Movement (CPDM), Social\nDemocratic Front (SDF), National Union for Democracy and Progress (NUDP),\nCameroon Democratic Union (CDU), Progressive Movement (PM)\nof urbanites who claimed affinity through sharing a common rural\nhome) precisely because they helped to marginalize \u2018strangers\u2019. These\nassociations were seen as a vehicle that could be used to by-\npass multi-party politics among rural electorates. Since most of\nthe leaders of the associations were civil servants it was easy for\nthe ruling party to bring pressure to bear on them to go \u2018home\u2019\non campaigns to mobilize votes. Francis Nyamnjoh and Michael\nRowlands went so far as to claim that some of these \u2018ethnicized elite\nassociations\u2019 were \u2018the prime movers in local regional politics\u2019 and\nsignalled \u2018the attempt by the ruling party to maintain local support\nat all costs\u2019 (1998: 320\u20131). New and established politicians asserted\ntheir interests in their place of origin through participating in the\nassociation. By pursuing local interests these associations undermined\nany attempt to develop a united national opposition during an extended\nperiod of economic and political tensions in the first half of the\n1990s.\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\n358 REVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING\nA decade or so on, the \u2018threat\u2019 to the political establishment from\nopposition parties has gone and as a result the political salience of elite\nhometown associations is reduced. The work of home associations in\nmany places is consciously disconnected from politics. The vast bulk of\nthe time in home association meetings is directed towards discussing\nthe welfare of members or self-help development projects. In some\ncases association members and leaders are almost aggressively wary\nof those individuals who seek to use associations as personal political\nplatforms. Even allowing for the fact that the language of development\nis well known for its capacity to depoliticize the politically contentious,\nthere is little doubt that because the \u2018threat\u2019 from multi-party politics\nhas gone the political urgency to use these associations has also\nwaned.\nIf the rise of the politics of belonging was a consequence of the\nrise of multi-party democracy, why has the former survived the latter?\nIt is much harder to erase the idea that autochthons have particular\nrights than to validate them through speeches, laws and bureaucratic\nregulation. The politics of belonging is not quite a \u2018Pandora\u2019s box\u2019\nbecause there are many examples (including Cameroon during the\n1970s and 1980s, see Kofele-Kale 1981) where a concerted effort\ncan dull differences, but nevertheless \u2018political tribalism\u2019 (Lonsdale\n1992, 1994) has become the standard lens through which many\nCameroonians outside the main cities understand politics (Nyamnjoh\n1999). Having endorsed this view it is hard for the establishment to\nchange it, even if they now wanted to do so. The emphasis on belonging\nstill serves established interests as it capitalizes on a powerful sense\nof local loyalty, whilst containing opposition within those areas that\nsteadfastly refuse to be co-opted by the ruling party. The apparent\n\u2018naturalness\u2019 of autochthony also makes it ideologically resistant to\nchange. This has become the way in which Cameroonian citizens \u2018do\u2019\npolitics and imagining other ways of national political being is hard.\nCameroonian politics treats the idea of \u2018belonging\u2019 as axiomatic and\nincontrovertible (Nyamnjoh 2002; Fonchingong 2005; Jua 2005; Ndjio\n2006; W. Nkwi 2006).\nHowever as the significance of multi-party democracy as an\nexplanation for the rise of autochthony declines, so other explanations\nbecome more apparent. At a global scale there has been a resurgence\nof place-based politics. According to Nira Yuval Davis, belonging\nis \u2018about emotional attachment, about feeling . . . \u201csafe\u201d \u2019 (2006: 197;\nsee also Yuval Davis 2003, 2004). Belonging provides a feeling of\nsecurity in an apparently unpredicatable world through inter-subjective\nacknowledgement. In Cameroon this desire for security is driven by\na sense of powerlessness over the fluctuations of prices for basic\nfoods, the hikes in energy prices, the retreat of the state from service\nprovision, the end of familiar forms of employment on plantations or\nin the civil service, the lottery for American visas, the capricious rules\ngoverning international migration, the erratic sending of remittances. It\nmight well be a delusion, but a \u2018home\u2019 where familiar people rehearse\nfamiliar rituals and where the lineaments of power are recognizable and\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\nREVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING 359\nvisible appears to offer some refuge in a changing world. A political\nstrategy that naturalizes and endorses autochthons\u2019 rights over the\nspace called home promises (however fictitiously) increased control\nover that space. That the real result of such a strategy can include the\nmaintenance of the political status quo and the efflorescence of conflicts\nlike the violence in Bawock is of less relevance than the fantasy it\noffers.\nTHE \u2018POLITICS OF CONVIVIALITY\u2019\nAn analysis of Cameroonian politics that identifies the risks of\nemphasizing autochthony is convincing, but it is rather negative\nbecause it treats \u2018belonging\u2019 and ethnicity as malevolent forces in\npolitics. Such a position is in line with three decades of social science\nin Africa, which has assumed that strong ethnic identities are a barrier\nto effective political accountability. The manipulation of place-based\nloyalties is indeed \u2018worrying\u2019 (Nyamnjoh and Rowlands 1998: 330),\nbut it is also possible to identify an alternative facet to the politics\nof belonging. Belonging not only articulates with \u2018political tribalism\u2019\nbut can also be associated with \u2018moral ethnicity\u2019 (Lonsdale 1992,\n1994):\nPolitical tribalism flows down from high political intrigue; it constitutes\ncommunities through external competition. Moral ethnicity creates\ncommunities from within through domestic controversy over civic virtue.\nIt ascends from the deep antagonism to the very forces on which political\ntribalism thrives. (Lonsdale 1992: 466)\nJohn Lonsdale uses this distinction to argue that \u2018an ethnic imagination\nmay not be so subversive of modern African states as is generally\nbelieved; it may be constructive\u2019 (Lonsdale 1992: 317\u201318). Gikuyu\npolitical values can be used by a public to hold its leaders to account.\nOr as Chabal and Daloz ask, \u2018is it conceivable that . . . a political\ncompact based on ethnicity could bring together, rather than separate,\nthe constituent members of what now form African countries?\u2019\n(1999: 58).\nPolitical belonging describes a process of exploiting the desire for\na secure home for elite political ends. In contrast moral conviviality\ndescribes local ideas about the right and wrong ways for diverse groups\nof people to live together and the process by which local elites can be\ndisciplined for transgressing such norms. Public deliberations about the\nright way to be a good member of a community, which draw on deep\nvalues, are the hallmark of a more co-operative but still local scale\nof solidarity. Moral conviviality is closely aligned with a progressive\npolitics of place (Massey 1993, 1994, 2006), which acknowledges the\ninternal heterogeneity of communities within any location, tolerates\ninternal differences, is open to change and newcomers, and has\nan outward-looking attitude concerned with developing connections\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\n360 REVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING\nacross space. Conviviality is no less about being \u2018one of the group\u2019 than\nbelonging, but it is an extroverted rather than an inward-looking group.\nThere are two dimensions to the way in which moral conviviality\nworks in Bali. First there is the history of the agglomeration of different\nethnic groups who come together under the umbrella of a single\nBali Nyonga identity. Internal ethnic differences are neither erased\nnor forgotten as time passes, but they are contingently set aside.\nAn exchange of languages, ceremonies and institutions binds these\ndifferent groups together by remembering their differences. There is\nsome evidence that Bali historians are well aware of these internal\ndifferences, but in the current climate there is little incentive to draw\nattention to them. Second, there is the need to collaborate and connect\nwith neighbours (external differences) in order to achieve development\ngoals that operate at a scale other than the most local.\nBoth these aspects appear to be instrumental. Framed this way, it\nis reasonable to ask whether this should not really be called pragmatic\nrather than moral conviviality. However, many Bali interviewees started\ndebates about social relations from the proposition that a peaceful\nenvironment in its widest sense is better for a contented family and\ncommunity life. This betterness is inherent rather than instrumental.\nBali political values claim that it is right in itself for different groups\nto cooperate within the community. There is no doubt amongst the\nleaders in Bali that the political ideal is of peaceful internal coexistence.\nFor long periods of time in the twentieth century this goal was achieved.\nOf course Bali has no monopoly on asserting such values, but the\npoint is that they stand in stark contrast both to Bali\u2019s regional\nreputation and to the common idiom of current political language,\nwhich emphasizes defence and competition over cooperation. That\nrecent political practice in Bali has not always reflected such values\nis a reflection of the dominance of political belonging over moral\nconviviality at the current time. At certain times and in certain places\nbelonging seems to be dominant. But even in the wake of all the\nviolence and displacement, moral conviviality was quickly expressed\nthrough attempts at reconciliation. The issue is less one of \u2018dominance\u2019\nand more one of a never-ending tussle between the two ideas.\nThe first dimension of conviviality concerns internal heterogeneity.\nA politics organized around places inevitably draws attention to the\nway in which the groups that live within those places are rarely actually\nethnically homogeneous. Bali Nyonga comprises several groups with\ndifferent histories who have coalesced over a period of at least two\ncenturies (Titanji et al. 1988). One powerful group (closely associated\nwith the palace) claim a Chamba ancestor and describe a journey\nas armed raiders from Adamawa in the late eighteenth century. But\non that journey the Mubakoh-speaking Chamba were joined by Bata,\nPare, Mbum, Buti, Tikari and BaTi elements. This alliance was\ndefeated militarily by a Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 force in 1835 and then split into\na number of separate rival groups. One of these splinter groups (led\nby Nyongpasi \u2013 thus Bali Nyonga) joined up with a large group of\nBaTi, from whom they acquired the language (Mungaka) that most\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\nREVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING 361\nBali people now speak. For a few decades Mubakoh and Mungaka co-\nexisted, but by the late nineteenth century Mubakoh had become only\na court language. By 1860 this amalgam had acquired their current\nhomeland by force from their \u2018cousins\u2019 the Bali Nkohntan (who had in\nturn taken it by force from its Meta inhabitants) and who were then\nincorporated into the new polity. Some of those Meta groups who were\nresident on the site also subsequently became incorporated into the Bali\nNyonga polity. Further BaTi groups adhered to Bali just after 1900\nand brought the Bawock with them around 1905. Whilst some of the\ndetails of the different groups who amalgamated to form Bali Nyonga\nmay be lost, different lineages still preserve these numerous internal\ndifferences through male lines of succession, differential roles within\nthe palace hierarchy, different names and different sub-chieftaincies\n(Fardon 2006: 4\u20135). The Bawock, for example, were respected by the\nBali Nyonga for their wood-carving skills and were actively engaged in\nsuch activities, not least contributing to the construction of pillars in\nthe palace (Geary 1988: 19\u201320 and 34).\nThese internal divisions are well-known within Bali. As one person\nput it, \u2018you know, Bali is like America. No one can claim indigeneity\u2019;18\nor, as another (who consciously combined loyalty to Bali with a loyalty\nto one of its sub-villages, Mbufung) said:\nMbufung was originally settled by the Widikum. Bali did not attack, and\nthey lived together. But now there have been many intermarriages with\nBali people, and the other Widikums fled. So Bali tradition encroached into\nMbufung. Mbufung speaks Mungaka. Only the very old speak the language\nof the Widikums. The Tikali, Buti, Ti peoples \u2013 they are all strangers. The\nreal original Bali people are very few. Bali is now very cosmopolitan.19\nNot only that, but people from Bali in the international diaspora\nare conscious that questions of belonging are being manipulated for\npersonal political ends amongst the elites in Bali, Santa and Bawock.\nThis does not mean they do not care about the issue or the loss of\nproperty, but it does show that they are conscious of the way in which\nindividual ambition is creating tensions in a context where cooperation\nis actually part of the history and the everyday reality. The right way\nfor people to live together in Bali involves acknowledging the value of\ndifferent groups, absorbing but not erasing such differences. Such a\nstrategy has been very successful over a long period of time.\nBali culture and political organization draws from its Grassfields\nneighbours as well as its Chamba roots. The Bali Nyonga established\nthemselves in the nineteenth century by becoming embroiled in a web\nof alliances with other Grassfields polities, particularly Bafreng and\nNkwen (Yenshu and Ngwa 2001; Yenshu 2003). The Bali template for\nsocial and political organization was not Chamba, but the successful\nneighbouring Grassfields kingdom of Bamun. The model for Bali\n18Member of Bali elite, Bamenda, 29 March 2005.\n19Member of Bali elite, Bamenda, 29 March 2005.\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\n362 REVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING\nNyonga carving and material culture in general is not the spare style\nof the Chamba, but what Richard Fardon calls \u2018the Baroque aesthetics\nof the Grassfields\u2019 (Fardon 2006: viii). Like Bamun (Geary 1988),\nBali Nyonga embraced the novelty of German material culture and\ncontinued to adopt and adapt new influences throughout the twentieth\ncentury. Far from building on a single Chamba past, Bali culture has\nappropriated liberally from a multiplicity of sources over two centuries.\nEven the most significant links to Chamba culture (the annual Lela\nfestival and the Voma secret society) are different from the current\nChamba variants (Fardon 2006). This process was not uni-directional\nand aspects of Bali ceremony and political organization were also\nadopted by other Grassfields states. However, because of the current\n\u2018need\u2019 to define Bali Nyonga in distinction from its neighbours this\ncollaborative process of exchange and engagement is an anathema to\nsome of Bali\u2019s historians.\nWhen the Bali Nyonga elite emphasize their Chamba roots and\ntheir martial past to present contemporary Bali Nyonga as a pure,\nhomogeneous ethnic identity with an unchanging character, they are\nproducing a narrative of political belonging. They set out to assert\ntheir difference from their Grassfields neighbours and their capacity\nand need to continue to \u2018fight\u2019 for their own land. Of course the Bali\nNyonga are not alone in the Grassfields (or indeed anywhere else)\nin their selective interpretation of history (Yenshu 2003), but more\nimportantly many Bali people are well aware of an alternative history\nof a process of successfully amalgamating difference.\nThe second dimension used to exemplify moral conviviality\nconcerns the need to collaborate with neighbours in order to achieve\ndevelopment goals. Bali Subdivision, though densely populated, is\nsmall. So although it has some influential elites in key positions in\nnational government, there are limits to its capacity to capture state\nfunding to deliver development goods. However, by cooperating with\ntheir neighbours they can secure mutual benefits. In Bali Nyonga\u2019s case\nthe new tarred main road is a key example, a project in which the elites\nworked alongside their historic \u2018competitors\u2019 in Batibo (to the west).\nBali and Batibo are both on the Lagos to Mombasa line of the Trans-\nAfrica Highway Network. However, for many years the earth road has\nbeen in a very poor state, and the short distance to Bamenda could\ntake travellers most of the day. In 2002\u20133 Chinese contractors were\ngiven the job of producing a new line for the road and tarring it, which\nthey did. Taxis now ply the route and the journey takes about half\nan hour. This CFA19,500 million project (about \u00a319.5 million) was\nprimarily funded by the African Development Bank (Fonjong 2004)\nbut the Cameroon government was closely involved.20 Local elites from\nBali and Batibo believed it was necessary to \u2018lobby\u2019 government officials\nin Yaound\u00e9 to ensure that the road project was not diverted to the\n20Prime Minister\u2019s speech in the North-West Province, 5 April 2001.\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\nREVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING 363\nnorth to pass throughMbengwi.21 They collected money to pay officials\nin Yaound\u00e9 in order to guarantee that the relevant papers moved\nthrough the system, that the contractor was paid promptly, and the\nwork completed. One member of the Bali elite described this process\nto us by comparing their strategy with an earlier episode further west\nalong the road in Manyu Division of South-West Province:\nA similar road plan from Momo to Mamfe collapsed because the Manyu\npeople were not as organized as those from the North-West. The contractor\nwas not being paid, the papers were not being given out, they left the project.\nWith the Bali road they had the same problem but they learnt from this\nprevious experience. I gave CFA100,000, I got CFA50,000 out of Mr X\nalthough he is staunch SDF and he thought it was going to CPDM\u2013we\npaid and got a person to go in, get the papers out, they paid the contractors\nand they finished the road. This was the elites \u2013 not only from Bali, some\nfrom Batibo.22\nHere we see political belonging and moral conviviality at work\nsimultaneously. Bali and Batibo (with their history of conflict)\ncooperate across the boundaries of belonging, though they do so at the\nexpense of Mbengwi and (rhetorically) of Manyu.\nThis example shows that the differences on which the politics of\nbelonging are founded can be set aside relatively easily for the practical\nnecessities of economic interest. The same point emerges through\ninterviews with Meta people in Bossa village, who prefer to live in Bali\nSubdivision rather than in the largely Meta Subdivision of Momo:\nIf you asked everyone in Bossa, 80\u201390 per cent of them would tell you that\nthey prefer to be in Bali rather than Momo Subdivision. Why? Because Bali\nis a small subdivision. When [government resources] come to Bali, Bossa\nalways gets a share. But if we were under Mbengwi, where there are no\nroads, no schools, and twenty-something villages, we in Bossa will not get\nour share of the cake.23\nConviviality is not unambiguously benevolent. It often rests on the\nexigencies of self-interest, but it does at least open up possibilities of a\npolitics that exploits local loyalties to home without necessarily leading\nto conflict.\nCONCLUSION\nThe initial motivation for emphasizing the rights of autochthons was\nto undermine multi-party democracy. This specific context has been\nreplaced by habit and by the local impact of the general context of\nglobal integration. The politics of home and belonging go with the grain\nof current popular sentiment because it speaks to the anxieties of rapid\n21Member of Bali elite, Bali, 15 February 2005.\n22Member of Bali elite, Limbe, 20 April 2005.\n23Member of Bossa elite, Bali, 5 March 2005.\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\n364 REVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING\nsocial change. A desire for belonging is not only a force that can lead\nto increased local conflicts; it can also simultaneously be a platform\nfor conviviality. Local ideas about the merits of internal cooperation\nacross ethnic difference and external neighbourliness all rest on the\nidea that conviviality is both inherently good and also useful. As one\nelite interviewee put it: \u2018We do not want to put fire under any other\npot. We want Bali as a peaceful unit. Let whatever people do be for\nthe interest of Bali.\u201924 Unobtrusively there is a great deal of successful\nliving together despite differences at a variety of scales (from individual\nmarriages to shared village development projects). There is a long\nhistory of absorption of other peoples and their cultures into Bali; the\nresulting mix makes Bali what it is. Becoming conscious of belonging\ncan foster recognition of internal differences, which might also help to\ncultivate better external relations.\nYet such ideas do not exist in a vacuum. They have to compete\nwith the alternative ideas that are associated with political belonging.25\nEvidence of people thinking of Bali as a homogeneous, unchanging\nplace with clearly defined boundaries is easy to find. Such an imaginary\nproduces a narrow account of history and an introverted sense of\nplace with an internalized search for origins. This is the source of the\nbellicose stereotype of \u2018Bali man\u2019. It would be perverse to pretend that\nthis set of ideas is not common at the current time. For example the\nformal, high-profile elements of Bali ceremony (such as Lela), which\nare demonstrations of the Fon\u2019s wealth and military strength, lend\nthemselves easily to an interpretation that emphasizes conflict rather\nthan cooperation. The overt violence between Bali and Bawock is the\nconsequence of allowing political belonging to dominate.\nIn 2005 the Governor of the North-West Province rebuked the\npopulation of Bali Subdivision:\nYou are fighting yourselves \u2013Bali Nyonga, Bawock, Mbororo \u2013where are\nyou going to? You should consider yourselves as people of the same\nsubdivision. This is a problem of tribalism . . . you know your problem is\nnot chieftaincy, it is tribalism [laughter in audience]. . . . You must accept\neach other.26\nThere is considerable chutzpah in the representative of the Cameroon\ngovernment castigating citizens for tribalism, given the government\u2019s\nrole in reviving political belonging. Such a move tries to relocate the\norigin of the struggle between political belonging and moral conviviality\nto the local level. It is a distancing gesture that enables the state to\nslough off responsibility for the circumstances it helped to create.\n24Member of Bali elite, Bali, 15 March 2005.\n25For similar debates in the Kenyan context, see Orvis 2001 and Klopp 2002.\n26His Excellency Koumpa Issa, Governor of the North-West Province, Bali, 15 March\n2005.\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\nREVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING 365\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council of the UK as\npart of a larger project on Development and the African Diaspora.

It outlines the impact of ten years\u2019 work in this\nfield and argues that notions of autochthony remain central in understanding\nCameroonian politics. However the three articles go on to argue that some\nof the claims about home, belonging and politics are difficult to reconcile\nwith the hazier reality observed on the ground. The articles aim to disturb\nany universal, inevitable or overly tidy segue between questions of belonging\nand claims of political segmentation. Too often the existing literature moves\ntoo quickly to an analysis that foregrounds only the worrisome dimensions of\na politics of belonging, thus leaving little space for other interpretations. To\nexplore this dilemma the article continues by exploring a land dispute in Bali\nNyonga, north-west Cameroon. It shows (1) how ideas of belonging remain\ncentral to the practice of politics; (2) how the politics of belonging has changed\nover time; and (3) how it is possible to foreground an alternative \u2018politics of\nJuly 13, 2010 Time: 09:08am afr152.tex\n370 REVISITING THE POLITICS OF BELONGING\nconviviality\u2019, which would otherwise be shaded out by the dominance of the\npolitics of belonging within the literature.\nR\u00c9SUM\u00c9\nCet article pr\u00e9sente une rubrique th\u00e9matique de revue consacr\u00e9e aux\nassociations de ressortissants au Cameroun. Il d\u00e9crit bri\u00e8vement l\u2019impact\nde dix ann\u00e9es de travaux dans ce domaine et soutient que les\nnotions d\u2019autochtonie demeurent centrales pour comprendre la politique\ncamerounaise. Or, les trois articles affirment qu\u2019il est difficile de concilier\ncertaines assertions concernant le lieu d\u2019origine, l\u2019appartenance et la politique\navec la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 plus floue observ\u00e9e sur le terrain. Ces articles cherchent\n\u00e0 troubler toute articulation universelle, in\u00e9vitable ou trop ordonn\u00e9e entre\nles questions d\u2019appartenance et les assertions de segmentation politique.\nLa litt\u00e9rature existante s\u2019empresse trop souvent de proposer une analyse\nqui ne met en avant que les dimensions pr\u00e9occupantes d\u2019une politique\nd\u2019appartenance, ne laissant ainsi que peu de place \u00e0 d\u2019autres interpr\u00e9tations.\nL\u2019article \u00e9tudie ensuite ce dilemme \u00e0 travers un contentieux foncier \u00e0 Bali\nNyonga, dans le Nord-Ouest du Cameroun. Il montre (1) comment les\nid\u00e9es d\u2019appartenance demeurent centrales dans la pratique de la politique,\n(2) comment la politique d\u2019appartenance a \u00e9volu\u00e9 au fil du temps et (3)\ncomment il est possible de mettre en avant une autre politique, une \u00ab politique\nde convivialit\u00e9 \u00bb, que risquerait d\u2019\u00e9clipser la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la politique\nd\u2019appartenance dans la litt\u00e9rature.\n"}
