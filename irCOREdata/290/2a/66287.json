Introduction\n[2] Easter microplate, located near 23\u0001S on the East\nPacific Rise, is probably the best documented active micro-\nplate. Identified by Herron [1972] and Forsyth [1972], its\nexistence was soon connected with the Easter hot spot and\nwith the extremely high spreading velocities in the East\nPacific Rise [Anderson et al., 1974]. More recent studies\nincluding analysis of earthquake focal mechanisms [Engeln\nand Stein, 1984], SeaMARC II and GLORIA long-range\nsidescan data, SeaBeam, and magnetic profiling data [Hey\net al., 1985; Francheteau et al., 1988; Searle et al., 1989;\nMartinez et al., 1991; Naar and Hey, 1991; Rusby and\nSearle, 1995] revealed in detail Easter microplate tectonics\nand evolution.\n[3] The large amount of acquired data has been used to\ntest models of deformation in ridge overlap systems [Engeln\net al., 1988]. Although an initial stage of internal deforma-\ntion is not excluded, plate reconstructions based on Easter\nmicroplate magnetic and structural evidence favor a model\nof rigid behavior [Naar and Hey, 1991; Rusby and Searle,\n1995]. Assuming this rigid behavior, Schouten et al. [1993]\nproposed a kinematic model for microplates, known as the\n\u2018\u2018roller bearing\u2019\u2019 model, which they applied not only to\nEaster but also to the Galapagos [Lonsdale, 1988] and Juan\nFernandez microplates [Larson et al., 1992].\n[4] According to the roller bearing model the microplate\nrotates as a rigid block between plates moving in opposite\ndirections. When the coupling between the microplate and\nthe two bounding plates is perfect, two points at the\nboundaries (which are the instantaneous poles of rotation\nof the microplate relative to the main plates) are instanta-\nneously fixed to the main plates. The basic postulate of this\nmodel is that the microplate is driven at the instantaneous\npoints of contact by the pull of the main plates.\n[5] Lithospheric block rotation driven by an edge mech-\nanism has previously been proposed by McKenzie and\nJackson [1983, 1986] to explain how distributed deforma-\ntion, common in continental regions, is related to the\nrelative motions between major bounding plates. They\nshowed that the rotation rate for an edge-driven model is\ntwice the rotation rate for a floating block embedded in a\ndeforming fluid. Therefore edge-driven models are more\nappropriate to describe fast rotations about vertical axes,\nsuch as that at Easter microplate.\n[6] The edge-driven, or roller bearing, model predicts that\nthe rotation rate of the microplate is equal to the spreading\nrate of the major plates divided by the distance between the\ninstantaneous rotation poles. This relation is in good agree-\nment with the present distance between Easter microplate\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO.

Nevertheless, the present instan-\ntaneous poles of Pacific-Easter and Nazca-Easter motion lie\n50 km away from the microplate boundaries and not\nactually on them [Rusby and Searle, 1995]. This implies\nthere is some degree of decoupling between the microplate\nand the major plates. Also, the plate reconstructions show\nthat the instantaneous poles of rotation have been fixed with\nrespect to the main plates, and thus have not moved with the\nrift tips through time as the model predicts. This implies that\nthe pseudofaults do not trace the trajectories of the Euler\npoles, but only the path of the propagating rift tips.\n[7] Despite its limitations the roller bearing model pro-\nvides a first-order description of the kinematics of micro-\nplates, especially of Easter and Juan Fernandez [Searle et\nal., 1993]. However, the model has never been tested from a\ndynamic point of view. Here we use Easter microplate as a\nrepresentative example to analyze the dynamic implications\nof the roller bearing model. Two complementary hypotheses\nare considered: the Schouten et al. [1993] hypothesis, where\nthe driving forces for the microplate rotation are shear\nforces acting along the northern and southern boundaries\nof the microplate; and the rift-driven hypothesis, where the\ndriving forces are due to the ridge resistance gradient along\nthe East and West Rifts (Figure 1).\n[8] At the scale of the large tectonic plates, the direction\nof maximum horizontal stress approximately follows the\ndirection of absolute plate motions, suggesting that the plate\nboundary forces that govern plate motions are also respon-\nsible for the first-order pattern of stress [e.g., Zoback, 1992;\nCoblentz and Richardson, 1995]. As a result, two-dimen-\nsional modeling efforts, including global [e.g., Solomon et\nal., 1975; Richardson et al., 1979] and single plate studies\n[e.g., Cloetingh and Wortel, 1986; Richardson and Reding,\n1991; Coblentz and Richardson, 1996; Wang et al., 1997;\nPacanovsky et al., 1999], have made use of the intraplate\nstress pattern to constrain the tectonic forces. In this study\nthe same methodology is for the first time applied to a ridge\noverlap or microplate system. The pattern of lithospheric\nstress inferred from observations at Easter microplate is\ncompiled and modeled using the finite element method. The\nobjective is to determine the forces governing Easter micro-\nplate rotation and to assess their relative magnitudes.\n2. Stress Indicators at Easter Microplate\n[9] The stress indicators at Easter microplate are the\nmorphological and structural observations, summarized in\nFigures 2 and 3, and the earthquake focal mechanism\nsolutions between 1963 and 2000, displayed in Figure 4.\nWe use the earthquake information to constrain the stress\ndirections inferred from the structural observations when\nseveral focal mechanisms in the same region show consis-\ntent directions of tension and compression axes.\n[10] The eastern and western boundaries of the micro-\nplate, called the East and West Rifts (Figure 2), display a\ntectonic pattern typical of other spreading segments and\npropagating rifts of the East Pacific Rise: normal faulting\nroughly parallel to the spreading axis, pseudofaults associ-\nated with the propagating rifts, and tectonically rotated\nfabric at the overlapping spreading centers and propagating\nrifts [e.g., Searle et al., 1989]. Figure 4 shows both strike-\nslip and normal focal mechanisms along the East and West\nRifts, with normal solutions predominating near the rift tips\n(northern end of East Rift and southern end of West Rift).\nThis suggests there is a component of shear along the rifts,\nand a tensile component, progressively stronger toward the\nrift tips, which is perpendicular to the rift strike and\ncharacteristic of mid-ocean ridges in general.\n[11] The southern boundary of the microplate is not well\ndefined (Figure 2). Its western end consists of two elevated\nridges, composed of en echelon scarps separated by short\noffsets. Francheteau et al. [1988] interpreted a 2-km-wide\nvalley that runs into the southern ridge at 26\u000145.50S,\n114\u0001500W, as the first expression of a transform fault which\nthey called the Orongo fracture zone. The earthquake focal\nmechanisms along the southern boundary of the microplate\nindicate a NW-SE direction of maximum compression\n(Figure 4). The strike of the Orongo fracture zone is\nWNW-ESE, so the earthquakes can be related with right-\nlateral strike-slip motion along WNW-ESE fault planes. To\nthe east, between the Orongo fracture zone and the East\nPacific Rise, the tectonic fabric includes ridges and scarps\nof varying trend, but no evidence of any defined plate\nboundary [Francheteau et al., 1988; Searle et al., 1989].\nIt is therefore not possible to decide if the observed earth-\nquakes are related to right-lateral strike slip motion along\nNW-SE planes or left-lateral strike slip motion along NE-\nSW planes.\n[12] The eastern end of the northern boundary is a broad\n(70\u2013100 km) zone of high-relief, nested grabens, enclosing\nthe 5980 m deep \u2018\u2018Pito deep\u2019\u2019 at 23\u0001S, 111\u000160W (Figure 2).\nBetween the Pito deep and 113\u0001000W, Francheteau et al.\n[1988] interpreted a narrow band of ENE-WSW trending\nfaults as a transform fault with almost pure strike-slip\nmovement, and named it the Pito fracture zone. To the\nwest, the northern boundary of the microplate consists of a\ncontinuous series of broad (15\u201335 km wide), high relief\n(1\u20132 km high) ridges, following roughly 23\u0001S latitude\n[Francheteau et al., 1988; Searle et al., 1989]. The strike\nand elevation of the northern boundary, especially in its\nwestern half, is consistent with an approximately N-S\ndirection of maximum compression. This direction of com-\npression is also consistent with a series of high-relief E-W\ntrending ridges observed in the Nazca plate (Figure 3).\nThese ridges, scattered from around 22\u0001S, 114\u0001W (close to\nthe EPR) to near the Pito deep area (Figure 2), vary in\nlength between 20 and 50 km and some stand more than 1\nkm above the surrounding seafloor [Rusby and Searle,\n1993].\n[13] The estimates of relative plate motions lead to the\ncalculation of the Easter-Nazca rotation pole at about\n22.5\u0001S, 112.4\u0001W (Figure 4) [Naar and Hey, 1989; Rusby\nand Searle, 1995]. This pole predicts a N-S component of\nmotion along the northern boundary, decreasing toward the\neast, combined with an east-west strike-slip component that\nincreases toward the east. The existence of the compres-\nsional ridges in the Nazca plate suggests that the northern\nboundary of the microplate is unable to accommodate all the\nconvergence between the Easter and Nazca plates and that\nthe Nazca plate has been undergoing compressional defor-\nmation. The asymmetry and steepness of these ridges led\nETG 14 - 2 NEVES ET AL.: EASTER MICROPLATE DYNAMICS\nFigure 1. Schouten et al. [1993] model versus the new rift model. The dotted area represents the\nmicroplate, bounded at the top and bottom by the northern and southern boundaries respectively, and\nbounded laterally by the East and West Rifts. Dashed lines represent isochrons and illustrate the accretion\ngradient along the microplate margins (the spreading rate decreases northward along the East Rift and\ndecreases southward along the West Rift). In the Schouten et al. model, the microplate is driven by shear\nforces along the northern and southern boundaries, produced by the drag of the main plates. In the new\nrift model, the microplate is driven by the clockwise torque produced by the gradient in the ridge\nresistance along the East and West Rifts.\nFigure 2.

The strike-\nslip mechanisms are compatible with right-lateral motion\nalong WNW-ESE fault planes. The component of thrust is\nsubstantiated by three thrust mechanisms, two observed in\nNazca and the other in the NW corner of the microplate.\n3. Strength of the Microplate\n[15] In order to estimate plate boundary forces and to\ncompare modeled stresses with the stress indicators and\nplate breaking stresses, we need to estimate the strength of\nthe lithosphere in the microplate.\n3.1. Lithospheric Strength\n[16] Flexural models at the East Pacific Rise commonly\npredict that the elastic lithosphere is 1\u20132 km thick at about\n10 km from the ridge axis and that it gradually thickens\naway with the square root of age [e.g., Kuo et al., 1986;\nWang and Cochran, 1993; Eberle and Forsyth, 1998; Shah\nand Buck, 2001]. It is therefore expected that within the\nEaster microplate the elastic lithosphere is thicker than 1\u2013\n2 km. Since the ductile lower lithosphere can withstand\nvery small deviatoric stress compared to the upper rigid\nlithosphere, we assume that the elastic lithosphere within\nthe microplate acts as a stress guide and that away from\nthe plate boundaries we can neglect the contribution of the\nductile lower lithosphere to the overall strength. Within the\nelastic or brittle region of the lithosphere the strength is\ndetermined from the Byerlee law [Byerlee, 1978], and the\nmaximum tectonic stress (i.e., the maximum horizontal\ndeviatoric stress) that can be withstood is twice the\nByerlee-based rock strength law. In the thrust and normal\nfault regimes the maximum tectonic stress for hydrostatic\npore fluid pressure can be written as [Turcotte and Schu-\nbert, 1982]\nS \u00bc \u00042fs rgz\u0005 rwgz\u00f0 \u00de\n1\u00fe f 2s\n\u0001 \u00021=2\t fs\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere the upper sign gives the maximum tectonic stress in\nextension and the lower sign gives the maximum tectonic\nstress in compression. The coefficient of friction, fs, varies\nbetween 0.6 and 0.85 for most rocks [Byerlee, 1978; Brace\nand Kohlstedt, 1980]. The meaning and value of the other\nsymbols are listed in Table 1. Note that the formula uses the\ndepth z below the seabed rather than the sea surface [Neves,\n2000].\n[17] In the transcurrent fault regime, the vertical stress,\nwhich is usually assumed to be the lithostatic pressure, is\nthe intermediate stress. In this case the maximum tectonic\nstress is harder to determine because both the maximum and\nminimum principal stresses are unknown. Nevertheless, the\nmaximum tectonic stress can be derived by writing the\nintermediate stress as\nszz \u00bc s3 \u00fe d s1 \u0005 s3\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere szz is the vertical stress, s3 is the minimum principal\nstress, d is a dimensionless factor 0 < d < 1, and s1 is the\nmaximum principal stress. With this definition the max-\nimum tectonic stress in the transcurrent fault regime is\nS \u00bc 2fs rgz\u0005 rwgz\u00f0 \u00de\n1\u00fe f 2s\n\u0001 \u00021=2\u0005 fs 1\u0005 2d\u00f0 \u00de\n: \u00f03\u00de\nFigure 3. (a) Interpretation of GLORIA image of part of\nNazca plate north of Easter microplate. Normal fault scarps\nformed at the East Pacific Rise are orthogonal to the\nspreading direction. Large, broad, east-west trending\nfeatures, crosscutting the normal faults, are asymmetric\nridges (confirmed by bathymetric data). (b) Close-up of\nridge labeled a in the top diagram. The pair of asymmetric\nridges appears to be linked by a transfer fault. The abrupt\ntermination of the EPR-parallel spreading fabric against\nsteep, south facing slopes, as well as the sharp base of those\nslopes, indicates the ridges have a faulted origin. Arrows\nindicate dextral transpressive stress (combination of north-\nsouth compression and east-west dextral shear) [after Rusby\nand Searle, 1993].\nETG 14 - 4 NEVES ET AL.: EASTER MICROPLATE DYNAMICS\n[18] For d = 0.5 equations (1) and (3) can be written in the\ncondensed form\nS \u00bc a rgz\u0005 rwgz\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere a depends on the fault type. For a fault with coefficient\nof friction fs = 0.75 we get a = 3.0 for thrust faults, a = 1.2\nfor strike-slip faults and a = 0.75 for normal faults.\n[19] The maximum tectonic stress S integrated over the\nthickness of a layer yields the maximum tectonic force, F,\nthat a unit length perpendicular to strike can withstand, and\nwill be referred to as the layer strength (in units of N\/m). F\ntherefore varies as the square of the brittle thickness.\nEstimates of the layer strength of the lithosphere in the\nnormal, strike-slip, and thrust faulting regimes for several\nestimates of the brittle layer thickness are listed in Table 2.\nLower and upper limits correspond to coefficients of friction\nof 0.6 and 0.85 respectively. We consider variations in the\nplate thickness later.\n3.2. Strength at the Microplate Boundaries\n[20] The strength at the microplate boundaries is impor-\ntant in assessing the maximum driving and resistive boun-\ndary stresses that can be withstood along its vertical edges.\n3.2.1. Northern Boundary\n[21] The strength in the western part of the northern\nboundary of the microplate is particularly important because\nof the evidence of brittle failure in compression in the\nadjacent region to the north. The nearest thrust fault to the\nEast Pacific Rise in the Nazca plate has its western end at 24\nkm from the ridge axis, corresponding to 0.3 Ma lithosphere\n[Rusby and Searle, 1993]. Analyzing the variation of gravity\nand bathymetry over the East Pacific Rise, Wang and\nCochran [1993] suggested that for fast spreading ridges the\neffective elastic thickness of the plate, Te, in km, is given by\nTe \u00bc 0:1\u00fe Rx12;\nwhere x is distance from the spreading axis (km) and R is a\nparameter between 0.2 and 0.3 km1\/2. An elastic thickness\nof 0.9\u20131.4 km is estimated for 0.3 Ma lithosphere using this\nexpression. Consequently, we assume that thrust faulting\noccurs when the Nazca brittle plate is at least 1 km thick,\nwhich requires a compressive tectonic force larger than 20\u2013\n35 GN\/m (Table 2) near the western end of the northern\nboundary.\n3.2.2. East and West Rifts\n[22] The strength at the East and West Rifts accounts for\nthe ridge resistance, and is the key parameter of our rift-\ndriven hypothesis for Easter microplate rotation. Theoretical\nand numerical models at mid-ocean ridges suggest that the\nmaximum tectonic stress resisting plate separation is of the\norder of tens of megapascals, and varies inversely with\nspreading rate [Lachenbruch, 1973; Tapponnier and Fran-\ncheteau, 1978; Sleep and Rosendahl, 1979; Phipps Morgan\net al., 1987; Chen and Morgan, 1990; Lin and Parmentier,\n1990; Neumann and Forsyth, 1993; Poliakov and Buck,\n1998]. The brittle thickness at the spreading axis is also\ninversely correlated with spreading rate. Both seismic\nevidence and thermomechanical and gravity modeling show\nthat the brittle plate thickness at slow spreading ridges is on\naverage 2 to 6 km thicker than at fast spreading ridges (e.g.,\nDetrick et al. [1987], Huang and Solomon [1988], Lin et al.\n[1990], Purdy et al. [1992], and Owens [1996], as reported\nby Searle et al. [1998]). Distributions of earthquake epi-\ncenters on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge suggest thicknesses up to\nabout 8 km [Kong et al., 1992; Wolfe et al., 1995; Toomey et\nal., 1988; Barclay et al., 2001], and values up to 9 km at the\nultraslow spreading (14 mm\/yr full rate) South West Indian\nRidge (T. Yamada et al., Microearthquake characteristics at\nthe Jourdanne segment, http:\/\/triton.ori.u-tokyo.ac.jp\/\n~intridge, 2002). Further evidence that slow spreading\nridges have greater brittle strengths than fast spreading ones\nis provided by their relatively higher levels of seismicity,\nlarger fault throws, and general rougher topography.\n[23] The variation of the spreading rate along the East and\nWest Rifts has been derived by Rusby [1992] from magnetic\nanomaly data and kinematic modeling.

Similarly, the full spreading rate\nalong the West Rift changes from \u000b136 mm\/yr at 23\u0001S to\n\u000b20 mm\/yr at 27\u0001S. The overall morphology of the rifts is\naffected by this spreading rate change: far from the rift tips,\nwhere spreading is fast, the \u2018\u2018rifts\u2019\u2019 have the appearance of a\nnormal fast spreading ridge with small fault scarps and an\naxial high, while at the slow spreading rift tips (especially the\nEast Rift), large-scale axial grabens with large normal faults\nare formed, suggesting a stronger lithosphere here [e.g.,\nMartinez et al., 1991]. As a consequence, the ridge resistance\nmust increase toward the tip of each rift, that is, northward\nalong the East Rift and southward along the West Rift.\n[24] To quantify the ridge resistance at the East and West\nRifts we would like to use the brittle strength estimates\ndetermined above (Table 2). However, these estimates can\nonly be used with confidence near the rift tips, where we\nexpect a major contribution of the (thick) brittle layer to the\noverall strength. Near the rift ends, where normal East\nPacific Rise spreading rates exist and the axial elastic\nlithosphere may not be thicker than 0.1\u20130.2 km [e.g.,\nKuo et al., 1986; Wang and Cochran, 1993], the contribu-\ntion of the brittle layer to the strength must be very small.\nThis does not imply very small strength near the rift ends.\nThus recent models of the axial high at the East Pacific Rise\nindicate that the ductile lower crust at the ridge axis may\nsignificantly contribute to the overall strength (e.g., Eberle\nand Forsyth [1998] suggest the viscous lower crust may\ncontribute with 10 GN\/m, more than the estimated strength\nof a brittle layer 1 km thick). Another argument in favor of\nsignificant strength near rift ends may be that the rate of\nthickening of the lithosphere away from the ridge axis is so\nfast that the strength of the plate boundary is likely to\ndepend on a mean thickness averaged over the innermost\nfew kilometers (e.g., Shah and Buck [2001] suggest the\nelastic layer could become \u000b2 km thick at less than 5 km\nfrom the East Pacific Rise axis).\n[25] We thus do not use direct estimates of the varying plate\nthickness or strength as inputs to our models, but rather\ndetermine the maximum tectonic force required by the\nmodels, infer the equivalent plate thickness, and discuss\nhow realistic this is.Moreover, we only use the brittle strength\nto compute the equivalent plate thickness at the rift tips.\n4. Modeling Assumptions and Procedure\n[26] The stress field at Easter microplate is calculated\nusing two-dimensional horizontal finite element models.\nThe boundaries adopted and the grid used in the calcula-\ntions are shown in Figure 5. The right and left boundaries of\nthe grid represent the East and West Rifts respectively. The\nnorthern boundary is represented by the straight line at the\ntop. The southern boundary, although not well defined in\nreality, is represented at the bottom by the simplest config-\nuration, which is also a straight line.\n[27] The models are elastic. This hypothesis applies\ninside the microplate, where the observations indicate small\ntotal deformation. Young\u2019s modulus is taken as E = 0.7 \u0001\n1011 Pa and the Poisson\u2019s ratio is n = 0.25. Only the non-\nlithostatic stress is modeled. Possible variations in litho-\nspheric thickness are negligible compared with Easter\nmicroplate horizontal dimensions, and as a result the tec-\ntonic force (the product of the tectonic stress by the thick-\nness) in the microplate is approximately conserved, i.e., is\napproximately independent of the model thickness. All the\nquantities in the models are averaged over the model\nthickness, which is assumed to be constant. The actual\nnonlithostatic stress in a microplate of varying thickness\ncan then be calculated by inverse linear scaling.\n[28] The plane stress assumption is used. The applied and\nresistive forces are all horizontal, and the top surface of the\nplate is free, implying that there are no vertical nonlitho-\nstatic stresses. As the vertical stress (less lithostatic compo-\nnent) is zero, thrust, normal, and transcurrent regimes can be\nreadily identified using Anderson\u2019s theory of faulting. If\nboth horizontal principal stresses are compressive there is a\nthrust fault regime. If both horizontal principal stresses are\ntensile there is a normal fault regime. If one of the\nhorizontal principal stresses is compressive and the other\nis tensile there is a strike-slip fault regime.\n[29] The fundamental hypothesis of the modeling proce-\ndure is that the microplate is in dynamical equilibrium.\nTectonic plates move at very slow rates, so in general the\nacceleration of the plates can be neglected. Also, the\nrotation rate of Easter microplate has been constant over\nthe last 3 Myr [Schouten et al., 1993; Searle et al., 1993], so\nthere is no angular acceleration. The relatively small\ndimensions of Easter microplate justify the flat plate\napproximation. The equilibrium condition then implies that\nthe total torque about a vertical axis, exerted by all the\nforces acting on the plate, must be zero. Thus the microplate\nmust be subjected to a combination of driving and resisting\ntorques, which are in equilibrium. The resisting torques are\nassumed to result from (1) resisting forces acting along the\nnorthern and southern boundaries of the microplate and (2)\nthe mantle basal drag, distributed over the base of the\nmicroplate. The driving torque is assumed to be due to\nthe drag of the main plates, either in the form of shear forces\nFigure 5. Finite element grid used to represent Easter\nmicroplate. The square indicates the location of the centre of\nrotation for the basal drag models.\nETG 14 - 6 NEVES ET AL.: EASTER MICROPLATE DYNAMICS\napplied along the northern and southern boundaries of the\nmicroplate (Schouten et al. hypothesis), or in the form of\nnormal forces applied along the East and West Rifts (rift-\ndriven hypothesis).\n5. Resisting Forces Along the Northern and\nSouthern Boundaries\n[30] The stress indicators at Easter microplate suggest that\nboth shear and normal forces exist along these boundaries.\nWe consider two possibilities corresponding to two types of\nboundary conditions:\n[31] 1. There are both shear and normal forces along the\nwhole length of the northern and southern boundaries.\n[32] 2. There are only normal forces in the half-length of\nthe northern and southern boundaries away from rift tips.\n[33] Shear and normal forces acting simultaneously create\ntranscurrent faulting conditions, which are consistent with\nthe earthquake focal mechanism solutions and the existence\nof the Pito and Orongo fracture zones. Normal forces along\nthe northern boundary are suggested by the compressional\nridges in the Nazca plate, as well as the elevation of the\nnorthern boundary itself. For simplicity these normal forces\nare mirrored along the southern boundary.\n[34] However, the crust is much weaker in tension than in\ncompression. Because the crust near the rift tips is subjected\nto tension, and the rifts tips curve toward the northern and\nsouthern boundaries, the halves of the boundaries adjacent\nto the rift tips may have effectively free boundaries. The\nother halves, with transcurrent faulting conditions, may\nsubsequently become weak relative to shear displacement,\nso that the boundary becomes constrained only in the\nnormal direction.\n[35] The resistances along the northern and southern\nboundaries are included in the analysis by fixing the\nappropriate boundary nodes to zero displacement. If the\nboundary is fixed in both directions then both shear and\nnormal forces can exist along that boundary. If the boundary\nis only fixed in the direction parallel or perpendicular to it,\nthen only shear or normal forces, respectively, can exist\nalong that boundary.\n6. Mantle Basal Drag\n[36] The mantle basal drag force quantifies the interaction\nbetween the lithosphere and the asthenosphere. In plate\ntectonic numerical models the basal drag is commonly\ncomputed [e.g., Richardson et al., 1979] from\n~FD \u00bc D~V \u00f05\u00de\nwhere ~FD is the mantle drag force per unit area, D is a\nconstant of proportionality, and ~V is the absolute velocity of\nthe plate in a fixed hot spot reference frame. Since Easter\nmicroplate is rotating relative to the Nazca and Pacific\nplates, its absolute motion can be decomposed into a\nrotation about an axis fixed relative to the microplate and a\ntranslation of that axis. The component of translation has no\nrelevance when the forces governing Easter microplate\nrotation are being analyzed. The component of rotation is\ngiven by the vector product of the angular velocity ~w (about\na vertical axis fixed to the microplate) and the distance to\nthe rotation axis,~r. The mantle basal drag due to the rotation\ncomponent is therefore\n~FD \u00bc D ~w\u0001~r\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f06\u00de\nIf the rotation of the microplate is driven by the astheno-\nspheric flow, then there must be a vortex in the astheno-\nsphere having increasing angular velocity with depth. This\nhypothesis is disregarded on the grounds of implausibility,\nand consequently it is assumed that the mantle basal drag\nresists the microplate rotation. According to equation (6) the\nmagnitude of the basal drag increases with the distance from\nthe rotation axis. The basal drag, being a resisting force, acts\nin an anticlockwise direction since the microplate rotates in\na clockwise direction.\n[37] The angular velocity of Easter microplate during the\nlast 3 Myr, estimated from the magnetic anomalies and\npredicted by the roller-bearing model, has been about 18\u0001\/\nMyr [Schouten et al., 1993; Searle et al., 1993; Cogne\u00b4 et al.,\n1995]. Using this rotation rate we calculate a basal drag that\nis tangent to circles about the centre of the microplate\nshown in Figure 5.\n[38] To determine the constant of proportionality D of\nequations (5) and (6), the asthenosphere is considered to be\na low-viscosity constant thickness channel, bounded at its\ntop by a moving lithosphere and at its bottom by a\nmotionless mesosphere. As a first approximation we assume\nthat circular flow produces the same shear stress as 2-D\nchannel Couette flow [e.g., Liggett, 1994]. The velocity\nprofile of a Newtonian fluid moving with velocity u in the\nhorizontal x direction, in a channel of constant thickness h,\nunder no applied horizontal pressure gradient, and with\nboundary conditions u = V at the top of the channel (y = 0),\nand u = 0 at the base (y = h), is [Turcotte and Schubert,\n1982]\nu \u00bc V 1\u0005 y\u00f0 \u00de=h: \u00f07\u00de\nAs a result of the gradient in the velocity profile, a shear\nstress is exerted on horizontal planes in the asthenosphere\nand at the base of the lithosphere. The shear stress at the\nbase of the lithosphere is\nt \u00bc h du\ndy\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003 \u00bc h\nV\nh\n; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere h is the viscosity of the asthenosphere. Making t of\nequation (8) equal to FD of equation (5) gives D = h\/h.\nThen, the expression of the basal drag becomes\n~FD \u00bc h\nh\n~w\u0001~r\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f09\u00de\nEaster microplate is a large mid-ocean ridge offset, so the\nasthenospheric viscosity beneath the microplate is likely to\nbe close to that beneath mid-ocean ridges. The few\nobservational constraints on the viscosity of the astheno-\nsphere near mid-ocean ridges indicate values between 1018\nPa s and 1019 Pa s. For instance, models of small-scale\nmantle convection consistent with the gravity lineations\nobserved in satellite data near the East Pacific Rise suggest\nNEVES ET AL.: EASTER MICROPLATE DYNAMICS ETG 14 - 7\na minimum of 1018 Pa s [Buck and Parmentier, 1986].\nPostglacial rebound data in Iceland require upper mantle\nviscosity values lower than 1019 Pa s [Sigmundsson, 1991].\nWe assume that the asthenospheric viscosity beneath Easter\nmicroplate may have a value in the range between 1 \u0001 1018\nPa s and 1 \u0001 1019 Pa s, and that the asthenosphere channel\nis 200 km thick.\n[39] In the finite element model the magnitude of the\nbasal drag is maximum at the boundaries of the grid. Using\nr = 240 km, w = 18\u0001\/Myr and h = 200 km in equation (9)\ngives\nFD \f 0:012 MPa h \u00bc 1\u0001 1018 Pa s;\nFD \f 0:12 MPa h \u00bc 1\u0001 1019 Pa s:\nThese values are in conformity with generally accepted\nestimates of the basal drag magnitude in the range 10\u00051\u2013\n10\u00052 MPa [e.g., Richardson et al., 1979; Richardson and\nReding, 1991; Wortel et al., 1991].\n[40] Since the models are 2-D horizontal, the vertical\nvariation of the shear stress within the plate is neglected,\nand the basal drag has to be averaged over the elastic plate\nthickness. The elastic thickness in the microplate is not\nconstant, but as already explained the tectonic force is\napproximately independent of the model thickness. So we\nassume the model has unit thickness, knowing that at any\npoint the actual stress is equal to the modeled stress multi-\nplied by the inverse of the actual elastic thickness. The\nvalue of the basal drag that is input to the models is thus FD\ndivided by 1 km. This input value has the dimensions of a\nforce per unit volume, i.e., a stress per unit length. The\nmodeling program deals with the basal drag as a horizontal\nbody force.\n7. Schouten et al. Model\n[41] In the ideal kinematic model proposed by Schouten\net al. [1993] the drag forces driving the microplate rotation\nare tangent to the microplate boundaries and act at two\nsingle points, which are simultaneously the tips of the\npropagating rifts and the instantaneous poles of rotation of\nEaster relative to Nazca and Pacific plates. Here we test the\nidea of a microplate being driven by drag forces distributed\nalong its boundaries. In practice this is more reasonable than\nhaving all the drag concentrated at only two points. Drag\nforces tangent to the microplate boundaries are in fact shear\nforces. Because mid-ocean ridges are associated with exten-\nsion it is not realistic to consider just shear forces along the\nEast and West Rifts. The driving forces consistent with the\nSchouten et al. hypothesis are therefore shear forces dis-\ntributed along the northern and southern boundaries of the\nmicroplate.\n[42] To test the Schouten et al. model, we assume: (1)\nshear driving forces along the northern and southern boun-\ndaries increasing linearly toward the boundary center (the\nability to sustain shear forces is expected to increase with\nthe plate thickness and age, i.e., away from the rifts); (2)\nfree boundary conditions along the East and West Rifts (if\nthe rifts are too weak to transmit the main plate\u2019s drag then\nthey are too weak to resist the microplate rotation); (3) a\nmantle basal drag contributing to 20% of the total resisting\ntorque (we show in the next section that this gives the best\nfit); and (4) 80% of the resistance to the microplate rotation\ncoming from normal forces along the whole length of the\nnorthern and southern boundaries (model SCHW, Figure 6),\nor just along approximately the half-length away from rift\ntips (model SCHH, Figure 6).\n[43] Recalling that there is not enough information to\nconstrain the stress directions along the southern boundary\nof the microplate, we seek a model predicting strong\naverage N-S compression in the western part of the northern\nboundary (the best constrained stress direction).\n[44] In interpreting Figure 6 we must beware the edge\neffects due to the geometry of the grid and to abrupt\nchanges in the boundary conditions. The abrupt changes\nin the boundary conditions (e.g., from locked in the\nnormal direction to unlocked) are artificial since in nature\nthey are expected to be gradual. Nevertheless, it can be\nobserved that model SCHH (Figure 6) gives the best fit\nto the strong compression in the western part of the\nnorthern boundary. Other boundary conditions were\ntested, in particular other distributions of shear driving\nand normal resisting forces (model SCHW in Figure 6 is\nan example), but these tests only proved that strong N-S\ncompression in the NW corner of the microplate requires\nthe driving shear forces and the normal resistances to be\nconcentrated in the half length of the boundary away\nfrom the East Rift tip.\n8. Rift-Driven Hypothesis\n[45] Another way the drag of the main plates can be\napplied to the microplate is along the East and West Rifts,\nprovided these have enough strength. At the latitude of\nEaster microplate the Nazca plate is moving with an\nazimuth of approximately 103\u0001 relative to the Pacific plate\n[DeMets et al., 1990]. For simplicity we will assume the\ndrag of the main plates is approximately E-W. This drag\nthen combines a normal tension component along the rifts,\ncharacteristic of mid-ocean ridges, and a shear component\nthat points south along the East Rift and north along the\nWest Rift. Because of the increasing ridge resistance both\nthe normal and the shear components of the drag are\nexpected to increase toward the rift tips.\n[46] The E-W pull applied to the East and West Rifts\nincreases from zero at the rift tail to 15 GN\/m at the rift tip.\nSuch a force distribution produces a driving torque which is\nin equilibrium with the resisting torque produced by the\nmantle basal drag computed for an asthenosphere viscosity\nof 5 \u0001 1018 Pa s (if no other resistances are included).\n[47] In models RIFT1 to RIFT5 (Figure 7) in addition to\nthe E-W pull and mantle basal drag we use normal resis-\ntances restricted to approximately the half-length of the\nnorthern and southern boundaries away from rift tips. To\nassess the relative contribution of the mantle basal drag to\nthe total resisting torque, the asthenosphere viscosity values,\nused in the mantle basal drag calculation, increase in steps\nof 1 \u0001 1018 Pa s, from 1 \u0001 1018 Pa s in model RIFT1 to 5 \u0001\n1018 Pa s in model RIFT5.\n[48] The best fit to a strong average N-S direction of\ncompression in the western part of the northern boundary is\nobtained in model RIFT1. This implies that the best fit to\nthe stress indicators occurs when 80% of the resistance to\nETG 14 - 8 NEVES ET AL.: EASTER MICROPLATE DYNAMICS\nthe driving forces comes from the northern and southern\nboundaries and only 20% comes from the mantle basal drag.\n9. Comparison With Strength Estimates\n[49] Both the Schouten et al. (SCHH) and the rift-driven\n(RIFT1) models can explain the observed N-S direction of\ncompression in the western part of the northern boundary.\nFor each of these driving mechanisms we now investigate\nthe brittle thickness variations required to produce compres-\nsional failure in the Nazca plate and to overcome the basal\ndrag. The strength estimates given earlier indicate that\ncompressional failure in the Nazca plate requires a mini-\nmum compressive force of 20\u201335 GN\/m at the western end\nFigure 6. The Schouten et al. model. The boundary conditions are displayed along the northern and\nsouthern boundaries: shear driving forces are indicated by arrows, and fixing in the normal direction is\nindicated by the short vertical lines. The applied shear force per unit of thickness increases to a maximum\nof 15 and 30 MPa in models SCHW and SCHH, respectively (in order to produce the same driving\ntorque). The mantle basal drag has been computed for an asthenosphere viscosity of 1 \u0001 1018 Pa s.\nFigure 7. The rift-driven model. The boundary conditions are displayed at the bottom right: driving\nforces applied along the East and West Rifts are indicated by arrows, and fixing in the normal direction\nonly is indicated by the short vertical lines. The asthenosphere viscosity varies from 1 \u0001 1018 Pa s in\nmodel RIFT1 to 5 \u0001 1018 Pa s in model RIFT5.\nNEVES ET AL.: EASTER MICROPLATE DYNAMICS ETG 14 - 9\nof the northern boundary. Let us consider the mean value of\n28 GN\/m, which corresponds to fs = 0.75 and to an average\nstress of 28 MPa over a 1-km-thick elastic plate (the model\nthickness).\n[50] In model SCHH (Figure 6) the shear driving force\napplied along the northern and southern half boundaries\nincreases linearly from zero at the rift tails to 30 GN\/m at\nthe boundary centre, producing the required 28 MPa of\ncompression in the western end of the northern boundary.\nTo sustain a tectonic force of 30 GN\/m in the strike-slip\nregime, the brittle lithosphere is required to be at least 1.6\nkm thick (see Table 2). Wang and Cochran\u2019s [1993] relation\ngives a minimum plate thickness of 2.9 km for this part of\nthe microplate, which is at least 200 km from its spreading\naxis, and so is more than adequate to transmit the driving\nforce. All other stresses are less than the likely plate\nstrength. We conclude that the Schouten et al. mechanism\ncan drive the microplate from the strength point of view.\n[51] In model RIFT1 (Figure 7) the compressive stress in\nthe western end of the northern boundary is also approx-\nimately 28 MPa, and the driving force applied along the\nEast and West Rifts varies between 0 and 15 GN\/m. To\naccommodate this tensile tectonic force without exceeding\nthe tensile strength, the brittle lithosphere is required to\nthicken linearly by up to 1.5 km from rift tails to rift tips. If\nthe base of the seismogenic layer at slow spreading ridges is\nused as a proxy for the brittle plate thickness at rifts tips\n(and we note that the morphology at the rift tips is similar to\nthat at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge), then 8 km is an upper limit\nfor the brittle thickness at the rift tips. In the limit, the brittle\nplate thickness would be expected to thicken from the less\nthan 1 km typical of the East Pacific Rise at the rift tails, to\n8 km at the rift tips. The strength of such a brittle layer\ncould easily accommodate tensile stresses along the rifts\nwhich would provide more than the torque needed to drive\nthe plate against all the inferred resistances.\n[52] The analysis of strength thus indicates that both the\nrift-driven and the Schouten et al. hypothesis are possible\ndriving mechanisms for the microplate rotation, and there-\nfore the microplate is probably driven by a combination of\nthem. However, because they give rise to very similar stress\npatterns (models SCHH and RIFT1) , it is impossible to\ndetermine the partition of the driving torque between these\ntwo hypothesis.\n10. Discussion\n10.1. Asthenosphere Viscosity\n[53] One of the basic premises of our modeling is that the\nmantle basal drag opposes the microplate rotation. Whether\nthe mantle basal drag is a resisting or a driving force may be\ncontroversial at the scale of the large tectonic plates, but a\nstable vortex in the lower mantle with 500 km diameter, as\nrequired to drive the microplate, seems very implausible.\nFurthermore, to drive the microplate the mantle basal drag\nshould have a significant magnitude, which is hard to\nreconcile with the low values of the mantle viscosity\nexpected near mid-ocean ridges. In fact, the asthenosphere\nviscosity that best fits the stress indicators, 1 \u0001 1018 Pa s,\nfalls near the lower limit of the acceptable range of values\n(perhaps because of the proximity of the Easter hot spot),\nconfirming that the mantle basal drag plays only a small role\nin the dynamic balance of the microplate (yielding a\nmaximum of 20% of the total resisting torque).\n10.2. Implications for Microplate Initiation\n[54] The initiation of a microplate requires the overlap of\npropagating rifts, followed by the development of motion\nindependent from that of the major plates. We also note that\nridge-ridge microplates appear to be confined to fast spread-\ning ridges. Commonly such microplates undergo rapid\nrotations about nearby vertical axes [e.g., Courtillot, 1980;\nLuyendyk et al., 1980; Engeln and Stein, 1984; Hey et al.,\n1985; Yelles-Chaouche et al., 1987; Lonsdale, 1988; Searle\net al., 1989; Naar and Hey, 1989; Larson et al., 1992;\nSchouten et al., 1993; Rusby and Searle, 1995]. According\nto our rift-driven mechanism, larger tensile stresses at rift\ntips than at rift tails are a necessary condition for microplate\nrotation. Before rotation can be initiated, the rift tips thus\nneed to produce, or terminate in, a brittle plate thickness\nsubstantially greater than normal. Otherwise, a simple trans-\nform fault connecting the two offset rift segments would\ndevelop rather than a rotating microplate.\n[55] Why is it that the known rotating microplates\ndevelop at fast spreading ridges, but apparently not at slow\nspreading ridges such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge? One reason\nmay be that the plate thickness at slow spreading ridges is\ntypically at least 4 km [e.g., Toomey et al., 1988; Kong et\nal., 1992] contrasting with the less than 1 km at the fast\nspreading East Pacific Rise. As plate strength is inferred to\nbe proportional to the square of thickness, the torque\nproduced by the outward pull of the main plates would\nneed to be at least 16 times greater than that needed at a fast\nspreading ridge.\n[56] Furthermore, whereas at fast spreading environ-\nments the spreading rate can decrease from over 100\nmm\/yr at rift tails to zero at the tip of the propagating\nrifts, at slow spreading ridges it cannot decrease by more\nthan 50 mm\/yr from tails to tips. Therefore the spreading\nrate variation along propagating rifts can more easily\nprovide the brittle lithospheric thickening required to drive\nmicroplate rotation in fast spreading environments than in\nslow spreading ones.\n[57] Spreading rate is not the only factor controlling\nlithospheric thickness along propagating rifts. Noting that\npseudofaults and slow spreading fracture zones have\nsimilar geophysical signatures, Kruse et al. [2000] argue\nthat the existence of thinner crust at propagating rift tips is\ndue to the same processes as the existence of thinner crust\nat slow spreading fracture zones, namely lack of magma\nsupply, amagmatic extension and possibly low-angle fault-\ning. However, the absence of microplates at slow spread-\ning ridges like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge suggests that these\nprocesses also do not cause enough brittle lithospheric\nthickening along rifts to drive rotation against the resisting\nforces.\n[58] Finally, in the Schouten et al. model the driving\nforces and 80% of the resisting forces are applied along the\nsame boundary. In this case a thicker lithosphere at the non-\nrift boundaries leads to a greater resisting torque, but also to\na greater possible driving torque. As a consequence, argu-\nments based on the difference of lithosphere thickness\nbetween fast and slow spreading environments do not work\nwith the Schouten et al. hypothesis. The absence of rotating\nETG 14 - 10 NEVES ET AL.: EASTER MICROPLATE DYNAMICS\nmicroplates at slow spreading ridges thus suggest that the\nrift-driven model is the main driving mechanism for micro-\nplate rotation.\n11. Conclusions\n[59] 1. We have modeled microplate dynamics using\nfinite element analysis and interpreted them using the\nByerlee strength formulation, where strength increases\nlinearly with depth. The strength of the brittle lithosphere\nis then proportional to the square of its thickness and is\nabout four times greater under compression than tension.\n[60] 2. The microplate rotation is driven by the outward\npull of the main Pacific and Nazca plates as they diverge, as\nsuggested by Schouten et al. [1993], and not by the under-\nside drag, which acts as a resistance to the rotation.\n[61] 3. At least 80% of the total resisting torque occurs\nalong the northern and southern (non-rift) boundaries, and is\ncaused by normal resistances in the vicinity of these\nboundaries. These resistances are tensional adjacent to the\nrift tips but compressive toward the rift tail ends, with\ncompressive resistance dominating. The mantle basal drag\ncontributes a maximum of 20% to the resisting torques,\nwhich implies that the underlying asthenosphere has a\nviscosity of 1 \u0001 1018 Pa s or less.\n[62] 4. The hypothesis that the pull is principally applied\nto the plate by shear stress along the northern and southern\nboundaries [Schouten et al., 1993] can explain the com-\npressive failure near the northern boundary.\n[63] 5. The hypothesis that the pull is principally applied\nalong the East and West Rifts can also explain the stress\nindicators. We have shown that a normal tension transmitted\nacross the two rift zones, increasing linearly from near zero\nat the rift tails to a maximum value at the rift tips, can\nprovide the diving torque necessary for microplate rotation.\nThis hypothesis requires that there should be an increase in\nbrittle plate thickness of about 1.5 km from rift tail to rift\ntip. An actual thickening greater than this is to be expected\nas a consequence of the slowing spreading rate toward the\nrift tips.\n[64] 6. We suggest that microplates are mainly driven by\nthe rift mechanism, although a combination of both driving\nshear along the nonrift and driving tension along the rift\nboundaries is to be expected.\n[65] Acknowledgments.
