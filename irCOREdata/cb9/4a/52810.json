The perception of the technique has changed, from that of a novel, but \ncomplex surveying tool to a relatively simple, almost routine method for precision \nmeasurement. The method was first widely used within the quarry industry where the \nresults of repeat surveys were used to manage and plan material extraction. The \ntechnique has subsequently found architectural, civil engineering and industrial \napplications and, more recently has been adopted by the computer games industry to \ncapture street scenery. Within geoscience, terrestrial LiDAR has been applied to the \nmonitoring of volcanoes (Hunter et al., 2003), earthquake and mining subsidence, \nquarrying, buildings, heritage and conservation, forensics (Paul & Iwan, 2001; Hiatt, \n2002), landslides (Rowlands et al., 2003) and coastal erosion (Hobbs et al., 2002; \nMiller et al., 2006; Poulton et al., 2006). The method has developed in parallel with \nairborne LiDAR, and to some extent terrestrial photogrammetry (Adams et al., 2003) \nand other airborne\/ spaceborne techniques (Balson et al., 1998; Webster & Dias, \n2006). This paper describes the different techniques and applications to which the \nBritish Geological Survey (BGS) has used terrestrial LiDAR over the past six years, \nand the successes and difficulties that have been encountered over that time. \n \nTERRESTRIAL LiDAR \u2013 APPLICATIONS AT BGS \nSince 2000, the BGS has used various terrestrial LiDAR and GPS systems in \ncombination to measure, record and monitor a variety of geological exposures and \ngeomorphological subjects, initially in collaboration with 3DLaserMapping Ltd. Most \nof the work has centred on the monitoring of active landslides on eroding coastlines, \nwhere the target surface is visible from a number of locations and is generally free of \nvegetation. Good reflections are returned from natural rock and soil materials at these \nsites, with rare exceptions where water seepage dramatically reduces the reflectance \nof dark mudrocks. \n \n 2\nThe platform for the scanner is usually a tripod (Figure 1). This provides the \nversatility and mobility essential when scanning in a dynamic environment, where any \nkind of permanent installation is ruled out. The instrument can either be positioned \nover a known point or a differential global positioning system (dGPS) antenna \nsubstituted for the scanner to obtain the position, provided that the height is accurately \nmeasured, and the discrepancy between antenna and scanner heights is accounted for. \nCare must be taken to ensure tripod stability, particularly in sand. Most cliffs can be \nlaser-scanned from the beach or rock platform using this method, but with certain \ncaveats described later. \n \n \nFigure 1 Laser scanner mounted on tripod \u2013 mobile set-up \n \nPerhaps surprisingly, the method is also suited to low-lying features, normally only \nconsidered for airborne LiDAR, with the proviso that elevated vantage points are \nnecessary. These may be provided by a vehicle roof in a temporary configuration \n(Figure 2) or, increasingly commonly, a dedicated vehicle mounting. Most vehicle \nmounting arrangements suffers in strong winds, although jacks were used at the four \ncorners of the vehicle to eliminate suspension movement and provide stability. A \nmodular gantry (Figure 3) or hydraulic platform may also be used. However, there are \nimportant issues of stability particularly where the instrument cannot be remotely \noperated. In the case of critical monitoring, e.g. for a large extremely hazardous \nlandslide or volcano, a permanent solid monument is preferred, and if possible the \ninstrument mounted on a long-term basis. The latter situation minimises errors due to \ninstability and setting up associated with temporary tripod-mounting, but of course \nties up the instrument for long periods and may expose it to damage. In a coastal \nsituation the installation of a solid monument is usually not feasible. The set-up \nshown in Figure 4, whilst providing a solid platform, can only be temporary as the \ntide covers the block, as evidenced by the mussels attached to it. \n \n 3\n \nFigure 2 Laser scanning from vehicle roof \u2013 mobile set-up \n \n \nFigure 3 Laser scanning from a 6m high modular gantry \u2013 temporary set-up \n \nIn most cases it is not possible to erect permanent monuments on the coast or estuary \nfrom which to laser-scan. Where monitoring is required using temporary mobile \nplatforms (e.g. tripods), laser scans must be oriented to a fixed grid reference system. \nIn areas of coastal erosion lacking fixed reference points, the current solution is \ngeodetic-quality dGPS. The raw output data from a scan consist of vertical and \nhorizontal angles, distances, and reflective intensities, plus calibrated digital images \nwhere available. The angles and distances are subsequently \u2018oriented\u2019 into xyz grid \nco-ordinate positions (local or global) on the computer using dGPS (or other) location \ninformation. This format allows \u2018oriented\u2019 scans taken from other positions to be \ncombined, as well as roving GPS data sets, to form a single model. Recently, the \nadditional feature of calibrated digital photography has enhanced the method, \nallowing both the raw data and the final 3D model to be coloured accurately, the \noutcome resembling a 3D photo. This is very useful for the geoscientist who wishes to \nvisualise, record, and measure terrain, structures, volumes, and processes. \n \n 4\n \nFigure 4 Laser scanner mounted to rock-bolt on WW2 concrete block \u2013 temporary set-up \n \nCOASTAL RECESSION \nCoastal recession is of worldwide concern, particularly in the light of current global \nclimate change predictions, associated sea level changes and increased storm \noccurrence (Lee & Clark, 2002; Clayton, 1989). Monitoring of recession is considered \na key factor in successful coastal management and hazard mitigation (Hall et al., \n2002). The coastal environment is one in which high precision surveying can be made \ndifficult by the dynamic nature of the environment. Typically, away from the built \nenvironment there are no lasting reference points with which to \u2018fix\u2019 each survey. \nEach element of the eroding coastline, i.e. cliff, platform, and beach, such as those in \nmany parts of eastern and southern England, is in an almost continuous state of flux. \nTides, unstable slopes, and the routine destruction of any fixed reference points \ntherefore create an immediate problem for the surveyor using terrestrial LiDAR in \nthese environments. Hence the need to accurately fix scans based on mobile or \ntemporary set-ups such as those shown in Figures 1 and 2. The use of dGPS to locate \nlaser scans can itself be compromised close to high cliffs, particularly where the \nsatellite configuration is unfavourable. \n \nMethods other than terrestrial LiDAR have been used to monitor unstable cliffs. \nThese may be subdivided into direct and other remote techniques. Examples of the \nformer include instrumented rock-bolts and cable tensiometers. Examples of the latter, \nTime Domain Reflectometry (Pasuto et al., 2000), and Digital Image Processing \n(Allersma, 2000). \n \nAs with other sciences, sophisticated computer models are increasingly being used to \ncharacterise and predict coastal cliff recession (Walkden & Hall, 2005), particularly \nwhere the element of climate change is introduced. These require quantitative input \ndata, such as those obtainable by terrestrial and aerial LiDAR and by other remote \ntechniques. Direct slope stability monitoring methods tend to be targeted at specific \nfeatures where movement is expected. They therefore provide only local information, \nand crucially may miss unforeseen movements or events. Quantitative information \nabout mass behaviour usually requires a remote method. \n \n \n \n 5\nSLOPE DYNAMICS PROJECT \nThe British Geological Survey has been carrying out coastal monitoring in England \nusing terrestrial LiDAR since 1999 (Hobbs et al., 2002). The Slope Dynamics Project \nhas 12 coastal locations where \u2018soft\u2019 rock cliffs are subject to marine erosion and\/or \nlandslide activity. These sites are scanned annually or bi-annually (depending on the \nrate of change) to assess the influence of geology, geomorphology, and geotechnics \non the process of cliff recession. Recently, active inland landslides have been included \n(Rowlands et al., 2003), though these tend to be more unusual and less dynamic than \ntheir coastal counterparts. As part of the project, platforms and beaches are included \nin the scans so that the relationships between wave attack and cliff degradation can be \nexamined. The role of landslides on cliff recession is a topic of some interest in \nBritain, particularly along the east and south coasts of England where the rocks \nmaking up cliffs and platforms are comparatively weak, susceptible to erosion and \ninstability, and marine attack is powerful. Huge quantities of sediment liberated from \nthe cliffs are moved along the coast or offshore, and re-deposited by the sea. \nModelling this action in response to time and environmental conditions is key to \nunderstanding the likely effects of climate change. Such models require quantitative \ninformation about cycles of sediment supply and the relationship with platform \nerosion and beach thickness in order to calibrate their predictions. Terrestrial LiDAR \nis one way of doing this, albeit on a local scale. \n \n \nFigure 5 Coastal mobile terrestrial LiDAR method \n \nThe method used by the project in the coastal environment involves setting up a \nbaseline on the foreshore, parallel to the cliff with a tripod at each end (Figure 5). The \ntripods are alternately occupied by a laser scanner and a dGPS antenna. The scanner \nfixes the position of the other tripod using either a single-shot (or an automated micro-\nscan) to a reflective target in place of the dGPS antenna, and then scans the cliff and \nplatform. This may be repeated along the foreshore, or in some cases on the cliff top \nin order to get the fullest possible coverage. Where large-scale rotational landslides \nand large embayments are present, this task may be difficult, particularly where \naccess to the cliff is impossible or unsafe. Coverage of \u2018shadow\u2019 areas may be \nimproved by infilling with a roving GPS where access is possible. The scan data \nconsist of xyz position and reflective intensity, with the possible addition of a digital \nimage mosaic provided by a built-in calibrated camera. The final output can be in the \nform of a \u2018point cloud\u2019 (Figure 6), a 2D intensity plot (Figure 7), a 3D point-cloud \n 6\ncoloured from the photo-mosaic (Figure 8), or a 3D triangulated \u2018solid\u2019 surface model \n(Figure 9) over which the photo-mosaic has been draped (Figure 10). The coloured \npoint-cloud output (Figure 8) is visually effective where the density of points is high, \nbut the solid model allows greater manipulation and the calculation of areas, volumes, \nand cross-sections. False-colour models can be utilised to show height (Figure 11) and \nrange (Figure 12). The various uses of these models by the geoscientist are \nsummarised in Table 1. \n \nTable 1 Uses for each model type \nModel:\nUses: \n2D intensity 3D point-\ncloud \n3D colour \npoint-cloud \n3D solid False-\ncolour \nLithology recognition \uf050\uf020  \uf050 \uf050  \nGeomorphology  \uf050 \uf050 \uf050 \uf050 \nStructural geology   \uf050 \uf050\uf020  \nVolumes, areas    \uf050 \uf050 \nCross-sections    \uf050  \n \nThe \u2018Scan A\u2019 example shown in Figures 6 to 13 is a 20 m high cliff formed in matrix-\ndominant Late Devensian tills (Withernsea Till and Skipsea Till Members of the \nHolderness Formation), from part of the 50 km long Holderness coast of East \nYorkshire. Historical erosion rates are between 1 and 2 m per year (Balson et al., \n1998). Landslides on this coastline typically consist of single rotational failures and \nsmaller toppling failures. The rotational features tend to develop en-echelon, a factor \npossibly related to sub-vertical joint patterns in the tills. \n \nIt is clear from the figures depicting Scan A that each model contains gaps or \n\u2018shadow\u2019 areas, which represent areas that the laser was unable to \u2018see\u2019. For instance, \nin Figure 13 a boulder close to the scanner has cast a long laser \u2018shadow\u2019 across the \nbeach thus preventing any points being captured behind it. This can be rectified to \nsome extent by carrying out multiple scans from several positions each having a \ndifferent viewpoint on the same object. Then with the application of the dGPS, or \nother, 3D model orientation method, these \u2018shadows\u2019 can be significantly reduced or \neliminated. Of course, this adds considerably to the amount of post-processing \nrequired. New dGPS systems are reducing the amount of post-processing by improved \nreal-time processing, for example by mobile telephone communication with a GPS \nnetwork. However, this may introduce a fresh problem associated with mobile \nnetwork coverage in remote locations. \n \nPROBLEMS TO CONSIDER \nOne problem with the triangulated \u2018solid\u2019 surface is that uneven coverage of points in \nthe original point cloud results in either gaps in the model (Figure 9) or oversized \npolygons (Figure 14) depending on the threshold parameters selected. This is \nparticularly the case where the cliff is receding unevenly from crest to toe, i.e. it has a \n\u2018stepped\u2019 profile, or where landslides are of a rotational type, featuring back-tilted slip \nmasses, and hence are in the laser \u2018shadow\u2019 when scanned from the beach. As the \nlaser scanner sweeps the subject from its fixed position it has the attribute of a \nshotgun; that is, nearby features are densely covered with points compared with \ndistant features. In the case of a largely planar subject such as a building, this may not \nbe a problem. However, for natural features such as cliffs, the result may be wide \nvariation in the surface detail captured, and hence the integrity of the 3D solid model.  \n \n 7\nIn the case of large coastal landslide complexes, the range of the instrument becomes \nan issue. Many high-speed laser scanners, having a maximum range of typically less \nthan 500 m, might struggle with such features, particularly where access to the cliff to \ncarry out multiple scans is impossible. A common problem encountered during the \nproject has been the inadequacy of PC \/ software combinations to deal with the \nmillions of points produced by modern scanners, notwithstanding that the scanners \nused were not classed as \u2018high-speed\u2019. This is particularly the case where \u2018solid\u2019 \nmodels are required. The repeated scanning of the same cliff enables changes in \nelevation to be displayed and quantified, provided that a solid grid-oriented model for \neach epoch has been produced. \n \n \n \nFigure 6 Part of Scan A showing raw point cloud \n \n \n \nFigure 7 Full Scan A \u2013 2D intensity plot \n \n \n 8\nFigure 8 Full Scan A \u2013 3D coloured point-cloud \n \n \nFigure 9 Full Scan A \u2013 3D triangulated \u2018solid\u2019 surface model \n \n \n \nFigure 10 Full Scan A \u2013 3D triangulated surface model with digital colour photo overlay \n \n \nFigure 11 False-colour 2D height model for Scan A (red=low, blue=high) \n \n \nFigure 12 False-colour 2D range model for Scan A (red=near, blue=far) \n \n 9\n \nFigure 13 Side view of part of Scan A \u2013 3D raw point-cloud (red arrow: boulder casting shadow) \n \n \nFigure 14 Scan B: triangulated surface model \n \n \n 10\n \nFigure 15 Scan B: elevation \u2018change\u2019 model for part of Scan B (refer to Figure 14) \n(red=height increase, blue=height decrease) \n \n \nCHANGE MODELS \nThe \u2018Scan B\u2019 example shown in Figures 14 and 15 is of a cliff up to 50 m high on the \nNorth Yorkshire coast consisting of complex superficial deposits of till and other \ninterlayered glacial deposits overlying folded and weak Speeton Clay Formation \nmudrocks. The \u2018change\u2019 model in Figure 15 shows the elevation difference between \ntwo solid 3D models, derived from scans taken one year apart. The resulting annual \nvertical displacement is coloured proportionately so that red is maximum ground level \nrise and blue is maximum ground level fall, though the two are not of equal \nmagnitude. In terms of slope morphology the change model shows us that a debris \nflow at the toe of the cliff has accumulated material, the backscarp has lost material, \nand changes have occurred to the beach levels. Information in the area of the \noversized polygons to the rear of the debris flow is probably unreliable. Again, the \ndensity and reliability of data are important factors when interpreting these change \nmodels (Miller et al., 2006).  \n \nWhen considering change models of coastal cliffs it is important to include the \nforeshore (platform and beach) as part of the same model as the cliff itself. This is for \ntwo reasons: firstly, the beach is a transient feature which may consist of both \ntransported material and debris derived locally from the landslide. As such, support of \nthe cliff toe and restriction of seepage are also transient features affecting the cliff \nitself. Secondly, a deep-seated landslide may have its slip surface extending below the \nlevel of the foreshore and hence the foreshore becomes directly involved in the \nmovement. In the long-term, the erosion of the platform itself must be considered as \npart of the model (Walkden & Hall, 2005). \n \nThe methodology for producing \u2018change\u2019 models is very much dependent on the \nsoftware packages available to the user, and can be achieved in a variety of ways and \nwith variable effectiveness depending on the geometry of the subject. These usually \ninvolve more than one package, and possibly as many as four. Issues relating to the \nrobustness of such models have been addressed by Miller et al. (2008). \n \n 11\nCONCLUSIONS \nIn order to correctly interpret the terrestrial LiDAR change models described, a \ncombination of models should be considered. These could include the elevation and \nrange models (Figures 11 & 12), which can have their own change models derived so \nthat the vertical and horizontal components of movement can be resolved. In its \nsimplest form, a rock fall from a vertical cliff face represents a loss of material from \nthe cliff face and an accretion of debris on the beach. However, a similar fall from the \ncrest of an inclined cliff will result in accretion at mid-cliff. This might appear from \nan elevation change model alone as if caused by an uplift of strata, as for example at \nthe toe of a rotational landslide, rather than a deposition of fallen debris. Subtle pre-\ncursor processes such as the opening of joints may produce apparent \u2018accretion\u2019 of the \ncliff face prior to failure and ultimate recession. Such small movements may or may \nnot be resolved by the scan depending on the method and equipment used.  \n \nThe basic 2D intensity model (Figure 7) is useful in distinguishing textures. This has a \ngreater applicability to man-made structures and materials (e.g. concrete, metal, \nbrick), but can still be useful for distinguishing the lithologies of strongly contrasting \ngeomaterials. Laser scan models enhanced by calibrated digital photography (Figures \n8 & 10) are a useful resource for the geoscientist, as the textures and colours greatly \nenhance the interpretation of lithology, structure, and geomorphology. This is of \ncourse further enhanced by the 3D capability, whereby the true geometry of coastal \nlandslide and erosion features can be appreciated. Solid 3D models allow volumes \nand areas to be calculated either in relation to a planar datum or to a previous model. \nThus, displaced volumes may be calculated and displaced masses estimated. \n \n \nREFERENCES \nAdams, J.C., Smith, M.J. and Bingley, R.M.
