Gelman, S. Gorpinich, C. Thompson \nCranfield University, UK \nAbstract. \n \nA generic adaptive approach is proposed for diagnosis of the bilinear mechanical systems. The approach adapts the \nfree oscillation method for bilinearity diagnosis of mechanical systems. The expediency of the adaptation is proved \nfor a recognition feature, the decrement of the free oscillations. The developed adaptation consists of variation of the \nadaptive likelihood ratio of the decrement with variation of the resonance frequency of the bilinear system. It is \nshown that in the cases of the frequency-independent and the frequency-dependent internal damping the adaptation \nis expedient. To investigate effectiveness of the adaptation in these cases, a numerical simulation was carried out. \nThe simulation results show that use of the adaptation increases the total probability of the correct diagnosis of \nsystem bi-linearity.  \n \n1. Introduction \n \nBilinear mechanical systems abound in many settings and applications. Some examples of bilinear mechanical \nsystems discussed in literature include: \n \n\u2022 oscillating mechanical systems with clearances and motion limiting stops [1] \n\u2022 offshore structures: free-hanging risers, tension leg platforms and suspended loads [2-4], \narticulated loading towers, constrained by a connection to a massive tanker or vessels moored \nagainst fenders [5] \n\u2022 damaged (e.g. cracked, pitted, etc.) mechanical systems [6-10] \n\u2022 un-damaged gearboxes [11] \n \nAmong the most widely used approaches for vibro-acoustical diagnosis of bilinearity of mechanical systems is the \nfree oscillation method [7-8, 12]. The method consists of the impact excitation of the free mechanical oscillations of \nthe bilinear system and evaluation of a diagnosis feature from the vibro-acoustical signals radiated by these \noscillations. As a diagnosis feature, the decrement of the free oscillations has widely been used [8-9].  \nNormally, diagnosis of the bilinear mechanical systems is carried out under presence of variable nuisance \nparameters [13-14] of the systems. Changes of nuisance parameters lead to the deterioration of recognition \neffectiveness [13-14]. Typical examples of the variable nuisance parameters for mechanical systems are \nthe performance parameters: e. g., the shaft speed, a load, etc. \n \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2\nThe problem is to preserve diagnosis effectiveness of the bilinear mechanical systems in presence of the variable \nnuisance parameters. It is important to solve this problem for various bilinear mechanical systems: systems with \nclearances and motion limiting stops, offshore structures, damaged and un-damaged machinery. This problem has \nnot been investigated in literature. \nTo preserve the recognition effectiveness, a new generic adaptive approach for system diagnosis is proposed here \nbased on an adaptive likelihood ratio. In general, the proposed adaptive likelihood ratio depends on diagnosis feature \nvector and also on vector of measurable variable nuisance parameters. This is an improvement over most published \napplications concerning recognition and diagnostics of various systems; normally the classical likelihood ratio [15] \naveraged over ranges of variable nuisance parameters is used for system recognition and diagnostics. \nThe purposes of this paper are to:  \n \n\u2022 propose a generic adaptive approach for system diagnosis \n\u2022 apply an adaptive approach for the free oscillation method of diagnosis of system bilinearity with the \ndecrement as a recognition feature \n\u2022 compare the proposed and traditional approaches for diagnosis of the bilinear mechanical systems \n \n2. The Bilinear System and Decrement of the Free Oscillations \n \nLet\u2019s consider a generic bilinear mechanical system, a single degree of freedom oscillator, in which the stiffness is \nbilinear: \n \n \n\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23a7\n<=++\n\u2265=++\n,0X ,02\n,0  ,02\n2\n2\nXXhX\nXXXhX\nCC\nSS\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u0005\u0005\u0005\n\u0005\u0005\u0005\n  (1) \n \nwhere X  is the displacement, m is the mass, CCCSSS hh \u03c9\u03b6\u03c9\u03b6 == , , S\u03b6 and C\u03b6  are the damping ratios at the \npositive and negative displacements, \nm\nk\nm\nk\nmk\nc\nmk\nc C\nC\nS\nS\nC\nC\nS\nS ==== \u03c9\u03c9\u03b6\u03b6   ,,\n2\n,\n2\n, c is the damping, Sk  \nand Ck  are the stiffness at the positive and negative displacements.  \nAt the positive displacement the stiffness decreases with the quantity SC kkk \u2212=\u0394  [1-11]. \nUsing Equation (1), the resonance frequencies at the positive and negative displacements can be written as follows \nrespectively:  \n \n21 SSSd \u03b6\u03c9\u03c9 \u2212= , \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n``       (2) \n21 CCCd \u03b6\u03c9\u03c9 \u2212=  \nUsing Equations (1-2), the resonance frequency of the bilinear system after transformations can be written as \nfollows: \n \n   2\n2\n2\n22\n0 4)(\n4\nm\nc\nSdCd\nSdCd\n+\n+\n=\n\u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c9     (3) \n \nEquation (3) is generic. In the important case of the low damped system (i.e., the damping ratios are less than 0.1) \nsubstituting Equations (2) into Equation (3) yields: \n \n2\n2\n2\n22\n0 4)(\n4\nm\nc\nSC\nSC +\n+\n=\n\u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\n\u03c9     (4) \n \nFinally, Equation for resonance frequency can be written as follows (see Appendix) [16]:  \n \n ,\n11\n12\nCd 0\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2212+\n\u2212\u22c5\n=\nk\nk\n\u03c9\u03c9   (5) \n \nwhere \u2217k  is the stiffness ratio, \nCk\nkk \u0394=\u2217 .  \nThe logarithmic decrement of the free oscillations of the bilinear system under impact initial conditions \n[ 0)0(,0)0( vxx == \u0005 ] is obtained from Equations (1) after transformations as: \n \n ( ) ( ) ,11111\n2 2\/1*\n2\/12\n0\n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212+\u2212\n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212+\u2212\n=\n\u2217\n\u2217\nkh\nk\nd\nC\nCdC\n\u03b6\u03c9\n\u03c9\u03b6\u03c0\n  (6) \n \nwhere \u2022h  is the normalized damping ratio [7 ], \n \n \nC\nSC\nh\nhh\nh\n\u2212\n=\n*   (7) \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n3. Adaptation of System Diagnosis \n \nProcedures of proposed generic adaptive approach are to \n \n\u2022 find a vector of measurable variable nuisance parameters for the selected recognition feature vector \n\u2022 measure these parameters  \n\u2022 use an adaptation of the likelihood ratio (i.e., the adaptive likelihood ratio): to vary the likelihood ratio of \ndiagnosis feature vector with variation of a vector of measurable variable nuisance parameters in order to \ndecrease influence of these parameters and thus, preserve the diagnosis effectiveness \n \nThe adaptation of the free oscillation method using the logarithmic decrement as a recognition feature could be \nachieved with use of measurable variable nuisance parameters on which the decrement depends. As shown by \nEquation (6), the decrement depends on the damping ratio C\u03b6 , the resonance frequency Cd\u03c9  at the negative \ndisplacement of the bilinear system, the resonance frequency 0\u03c9  of the bilinear system, the stiffness ratio \n\u2217k  and \nthe normalized damping ratio \u2217h .  \nThe stiffness ratio \u2217k  is a basic diagnosis parameter [1-11]; the considered diagnosis is based on the difference in \nthe stiffness ratios between the linear and the bilinear systems. According to Equation (7), the normalized damping \nratio \u2217h  depends on the basic recognition parameter \u2217k . The damping ratio C\u03b6  at the negative displacements (i. e., \nthe linear system), is a nuisance parameter.  \nOne can see from Equation (5) that the resonance frequency 0\u03c9  of the bilinear system depends on a basic diagnosis \nparameter, the stiffness ratio \u2217k , and the resonance frequency at the negative displacement Cd\u03c9 (i.e., the resonance \nfrequency of the linear system). Therefore, the resonance frequency 0\u03c9  can be used as a recognition feature [6] \nwhen the resonance frequency at the negative displacement Cd\u03c9  is known. Otherwise, the resonance frequencies 0\u03c9  \nand Cd\u03c9  also become nuisance parameters.  \nAn important case is considered here: the resonance frequency at the negative displacement Cd\u03c9  is the unknown \nmeasurable nuisance parameter. Thus, the resonance frequency of the bilinear system 0\u03c9  is also the unknown \nmeasurable nuisance parameter. Normally, the basic parameters of the bilinear system: mass m , damping c  and \nstiffness k are variable random parameters due to manufacturing tolerances of bilinear systems. Therefore, the \nresonance frequencies of the linear and bilinear systems are also variable random parameters. \nFor these cases, the adaptation depending on the measurable variable random resonance frequency of the bilinear \nsystem is proposed and investigated.  \nThe adaptive method consists of estimating the decrement d , the resonance frequency 0\u03c9  and the adaptive \nlikelihood ratio aL  which depends on the decrement estimate d\n\u0007\n and the estimate 0\u03c9\u02c6  of the resonance frequency: \n \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n ,\n),\u02c6(\n),\u02c6(\n)\u02c6,\u02c6(\n00\n10\n0 SdW\nSdW\ndLa\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 \u0007\n\u0007\n=    (8) \n \n \nwhere ),\u02c6( 0 jSdW \u03c9\n\u0007\n is the one-dimensional conditional probability density function (pdf) of the decrement estimate \nd\n\u0007\n which depends on status (class) jS  of the system and the estimate 0\u03c9\u02c6  of the resonance frequency, 1,0=j ; class \n0S  corresponds to the linear system with resonance frequency Cd\u03c9 , damping ratio C\u03b6  and the zero stiffness ratio; \nclass 1S  corresponds to the bilinear system with the bilinear stiffness and non-zero stiffness ratio. \nIn contrast, the classical non-adaptive method consists of estimating the decrement d  and the classical likelihood \nratio cL  which depends only on the decrement estimate d\n\u0007\n: \n \n ,\n)(\n)(\n)\u02c6(\n0\n1\nSdW\nSdW\ndLc \u0007\n\u0007\n=    (9) \n \nwhere )(\u02c6 jSdW\n\u0007\n is the one-dimensional conditional pdf of the decrement estimate d\n\u0007\n which depends on class jS  of \nthe system. \nThe pdf )(\u02c6 jSdW\n\u0007\n of the classical likelihood ratio is averaged over a range of the variable resonance frequency for \nclass jS . In contrast, the pdf ),\u02c6( 0 jSdW \u03c9\n\u0007\n of the adaptive likelihood ratio is not averaged over a range of the \nvariable resonance frequency. \nThen the standard decision-making procedure [15] should be used: the likelihood ratio aL  or cL  is compared with \none or several thresholds depending on the selected effectiveness criterion. For example, if the maximum likelihood \ncriterion [15] is used, then a threshold for the likelihood ratios is unity. \nIt should be highlighted that the proposed adaptation is expedient only if the resonance frequency of the bilinear \nsystem is variable.  \nTo prove expediency of the adaptation, dependencies between the decrement d  and the stiffness ratio \u2217k  were \nstudied for various values of the resonance frequency 0\u03c9  and two different proportional internal dampings [7]. \n \n4.

As in the previous case, the adaptation is expedient since, for constant values of \nthe nuisance parameter 0\u03c9 , the decrement depends on the stiffness ratio \n\u2217k . \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7\n5. Numerical Simulation \n \nTo estimate the effectiveness of the adaptation a numerical simulation was carried out for cases 4.1-4.2 and classes \n0S  and 1S . The variable random resonance frequency of the linear system Cd\u03c9  is assumed to be uniformly \ndistributed in the range (1000-1200) Hz, i.e., 20% variation. The random stiffness ratio of the bilinear system is \nuniformly distributed in the range (0-0.4]. The considered variation values correspond to real cases occurring in \nthe bilinear systems listed in the chapter 1.  \nIt is assumed without loss of generality that the decrement and the resonance frequency were measured without \nerrors for both classes. The damping parameter is 05.0=Ch  rad\/s. \n \n5. 1. Non-adaptive approach \n \nEstimates of the conditional pdfs of the decrement averaged over the resonance frequency ranges for classes 0S  \nand 1S  for different damping models were obtained using the Monte-Carlo procedure and Equations (5, 11, 13). To \nestimate these pdfs, 950 runs were simulated for each combination of the class and the damping model. Then the \nclassical likelihood ratios (9) were estimated on the basis of the averaged pdfs of the decrement.  \nEstimates P  of the total probabilities of the correct diagnosis for the non-adaptive and the adaptive approaches are \ncalculated as follows: bbll PPP \u03bc\u03bc += , where lP  and bP  are estimates of the probability of the correct diagnosis of \nthe linear and the bi-linear systems respectively; l\u03bc , and b\u03bc  are a priori probabilities of the linear and the bi-linear \nsystems respectively. Taking into account the equal number of the simulated runs for the linear and the bi-linear \nsystems, a priori probabilities are 5.0== bl \u03bc\u03bc . \nThese estimates are obtained by the simulation using the classical likelihood ratios and the maximum likelihood \ncriterion [15] and presented in Table. \n \n5. 2. Adaptive approach \n \nAccording to the assumption that the decrement and the resonance frequency were measured without errors for both \nclasses and due to the monotonous character of the dependencies presented in Fig. 1-2, the decrement values of the \nclass 0S  do not overlap with the decrement values of the class 1S . Therefore, when using the adaptive likelihood \nratio (8) and measuring the decrement and the resonance frequency without errors, the estimates of the total \nprobability of the correct diagnosis are equal to unity. \nTaking into account these estimates, one can see from Table that when using the adaptive approach, the estimates of \nthe total probability of the correct diagnosis increase by (19-20%). This increase highlights the efficiency of the \nproposed adaptive approach for bi-linearity diagnosis with the logarithmic decrement as a diagnosis feature.  \n \n \nAc\nce\npte\nd m\nan\nus\ncri\npt \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n6. Conclusions \n \n1. A generic adaptive approach was proposed for system diagnosis. The main idea of the approach is a \nvariation of the adaptive likelihood ratio with variation of vector of measurable variable nuisance parameters. The \napproach decreases the influence of these parameters on diagnostic features and thus preserves diagnosis \neffectiveness in the presence of variable nuisance parameters. \n2. The proposed approach was applied for the free oscillation method for bilinearity diagnosis of the bilinear \nmechanical systems. Expediency of the adaptation was proved for the following diagnosis feature: the decrement of \nthe free oscillations of the bilinear system. The resonance frequency of the bilinear system was selected as the \nmeasurable variable random nuisance parameter. The new generic analytical Equation for the resonance frequency \nof the bilinear system was obtained. \n3. The adaptation consists of a variation of the adaptive likelihood ratio of the decrement of the free \noscillations with variation of the variable random resonance frequency of the bilinear system. It was shown that in \nthe cases of the frequency-independent and the frequency-dependent internal dampings the proposed adaptation is \nexpedient. \nGenerally, the proposed adaptation is expedient if a diagnostic feature depends on a variable nuisance parameter. \n4. To investigate the adaptation effectiveness in the above mentioned cases, a numerical simulation was \ncarried out. The simulation results have shown that, when the adaptive approach was used, the estimates of the total \nprobability of the correct recognition increased by (19-20)%. This increase in probabilities is obtained for the \nconsidered numerical example.  \nGenerally, increase depends mainly on dependency between a diagnostic feature and a nuisance parameter and an \nerror in estimation of a nuisance parameter. \n5. The paper results indicate that use of the proposed adaptation for the decrement of the free oscillations \nimproves the effectiveness of bilinearity diagnosis for bilinear mechanical systems in presence of the variable \nnuisance parameter, the resonance frequency of the system. \n \n7.
