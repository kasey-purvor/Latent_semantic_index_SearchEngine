Throughout this interval, the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) at Longyearbyen observed a series of poleward-moving transient events of enhanced F-region plasma concentration (\u201cpolar cap patches\u201d), with a repetition period of the order of 10 min. Allowing for the estimated solar wind propagation delay of 75 (\u00b15)min, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) had a southward component during most of the interval. The magnetic footprint of the Cluster spacecraft, mapped to the ionosphere using the Tsyganenko T96 model (with input conditions prevailing during this event), was to the east of the ESR beams. Around 09:05 UT, the DMSP-F12 satellite flew over the ESR and showed a sawtooth cusp ion dispersion signature that also extended into the electrons on the equatorward edge of the cusp, revealing a pulsed magnetopause reconnection. The consequent enhanced ionospheric flow events were imaged by the SuperDARN HF backscatter radars. The average convection patterns (derived using the AMIE technique on data from the magnetometers, the EISCAT and SuperDARN radars, and the DMSP satellites) show that the associated poleward-moving events also convected over the predicted footprint of the Cluster spacecraft. Cluster observed enhancements in the fluxes of both electrons and ions. These events were found to be essentially identical at all four spacecraft, indicating that they had a much larger spatial scale than the satellite separation of the order of 600 km. Some of the events show a correspondence between the lowest energy magnetosheath electrons detected by the PEACE instrument on Cluster (10\u201320 eV) and the topside ionospheric enhancements seen by the ESR (at 400\u2013700 km). We suggest that a potential barrier at the magnetopause, which prevents the lowest energy electrons from entering the magnetosphere, is reduced when and where the boundary-normal magnetic field is enhanced and that the observed polar cap patches are produced by the consequent enhanced precipitation of the lowest energy electrons, making them and the low energy electron precipitation fossil remnants of the magnetopause reconnection rate pulses","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/70871.pdf","fullTextIdentifier":"http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/9994\/1\/art_681.pdf","pdfHashValue":"5bc1357acd3db43fdfae336a9377dad16075bdc3","publisher":null,"rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n    \n    \n      oai:eprints.lancs.ac.uk:9994<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2018-01-24T03:23:56Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n      7374617475733D707562<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      74797065733D61727469636C65<\/setSpec><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n    \n      \n        Coordinated Cluster, ground-based instrumentation and low-altitude satellite observations of transient poleward-moving events in the ionosphere and in the tail lobe<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        Lockwood, M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Opgenoorth, H.

Throughout this interval, the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) at Longyearbyen observed a series of poleward-moving transient events of enhanced F-region plasma concentration (\u201cpolar cap patches\u201d), with a repetition period of the order of 10 min. Allowing for the estimated solar wind propagation delay of 75 (\u00b15)min, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) had a southward component during most of the interval. The magnetic footprint of the Cluster spacecraft, mapped to the ionosphere using the Tsyganenko T96 model (with input conditions prevailing during this event), was to the east of the ESR beams. Around 09:05 UT, the DMSP-F12 satellite flew over the ESR and showed a sawtooth cusp ion dispersion signature that also extended into the electrons on the equatorward edge of the cusp, revealing a pulsed magnetopause reconnection. The consequent enhanced ionospheric flow events were imaged by the SuperDARN HF backscatter radars. The average convection patterns (derived using the AMIE technique on data from the magnetometers, the EISCAT and SuperDARN radars, and the DMSP satellites) show that the associated poleward-moving events also convected over the predicted footprint of the Cluster spacecraft. Cluster observed enhancements in the fluxes of both electrons and ions. These events were found to be essentially identical at all four spacecraft, indicating that they had a much larger spatial scale than the satellite separation of the order of 600 km. Some of the events show a correspondence between the lowest energy magnetosheath electrons detected by the PEACE instrument on Cluster (10\u201320 eV) and the topside ionospheric enhancements seen by the ESR (at 400\u2013700 km). We suggest that a potential barrier at the magnetopause, which prevents the lowest energy electrons from entering the magnetosphere, is reduced when and where the boundary-normal magnetic field is enhanced and that the observed polar cap patches are produced by the consequent enhanced precipitation of the lowest energy electrons, making them and the low energy electron precipitation fossil remnants of the magnetopause reconnection rate pulses.<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n        2001<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Journal Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/9994\/1\/art_681.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:relation>\n        http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5194\/angeo-19-1589-2001<\/dc:relation><dc:identifier>\n        Lockwood, M. and Opgenoorth, H.

Magnetospheric physics (polar cap phenomena;\nsolar wind \u2013 magnetosphere interactions; magnetosphere \u2013\nionosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Poleward-moving transient events in the cusp\/cleft\nThe cusp\/cleft aurora, dominated by 630 nm red line emis-\nsions from atomic oxygen, shows a series of poleward-\nmoving events when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\npoints southward (e.g. Sandholt et al., 1992; Fasel, 1995).\nUsing the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF\nand VHF incoherent scatter radars, these cusp\/cleft auro-\nral transients have been shown to be associated with tran-\nsient flow bursts (Lockwood et al., 1989a, b; 1993a, b; Moen\net al., 1995; 1996a) and consequent ion-neutral heating of\nthe ionospheric ion gas (Lockwood et al., 1993a, b; 1995a).\nThese events are quasi-periodic with a distribution of re-\npeat intervals between about 1 and 30 min, giving a mean\nvalue of about 7 min, but a mode value of about 3 min (Fasel,\n1995). This distribution is very similar to that of \u201cflux trans-\nfer events\u201d (FTEs) on the dayside magnetopause (Lockwood\nand Wild, 1993). However, in both cases, the low-period part\nof the distribution is likely to be set by instrument sensitivity\nand the criterion used to define events (as demonstrated by a\ncomparison of the results of Kuo et al. (1995) with those by\nLockwood and Wild). The transient auroral events are seen\nto form within the LLBL (cleft) precipitation, near the equa-\ntorward edge of the cusp\/cleft aurora (Moen et al., 1996b)\nand subsequently migrate poleward into the regions of the\ncusp and then the mantle precipitations, which is consistent\nwith the evolution of newly-opened field lines (Lockwood\net al., 1989a, b; Cowley et al., 1991b; Sandholt et al., 1992;\nLockwood et al., 1993a, c). The transient auroral events in\nthe northern hemisphere also move westward\/eastward when\nthe IMF by component is positive\/negative (e.g. Lockwood\net al., 1993a; Milan et al., 2000), as predicted for the curva-\nture (\u201ctension\u201d) force on the newly-opened field lines. The\nrepetitive pattern of formation and motion of these events\nshows that the patches of field lines are produced by pulses\nin the reconnection rate (Lockwood et al., 1995a) and not\nby steady reconnection in the presence of oscillations in the\nY component of the magnetic field in interplanetary space\n(Stauning, 1994; Stauning et al., 1994, 1995) or in the mag-\nnetosheath (Newell and Sibeck, 1993). This pattern of event\nmotion is also consistent with the asymmetric MLT distribu-\ntions of their occurrence for BY > 0 and BY < 0 (Karlson et\nal., 1996), as discussed by Cowley et al. (1991a).\nPinnock et al. (1993) used HF coherent scatter radars to\nimage these transient flow channels in the cusp\/cleft region\nand Milan et al. (1999) have shown that they are indeed asso-\nciated with the poleward-moving 630 nm optical transients.\nIn addition, Milan et al. (2000) have shown that the flow\nchannels are also associated with poleward-moving forms\nseen in global images of the UV aurora. These UV aurora,\nsuch as the 557.7 nm (atomic oxygen green line) aurora stud-\nied by Lockwood et al. (1993a), are coincident with the sheet\nof upward field-aligned current of the opposite directed pair\nthat is required to transfer the motion of the newly-opened\nflux into the ionosphere. Lockwood et al. (2001b) have pre-\ndicted that these arcs will form at the shear in the longitudinal\nflow speeds at the boundaries between events. The east-west\ndirection of the flow in the channels seen by HF radars is\ncontrolled by the prevailing IMF BY (Provan et al., 1998) and\ntheir motion, as for the optical transients, is consistent with\ntheir occurrence as a function of local time (Provan and Yeo-\nman, 1999; Provan et al., 1999). McWilliams et al. (2000)\nhave shown that the distribution of repeat periods of these\nenhanced flow events is very similar to the corresponding\ndistributions for 630 nm cusp\/cleft auroral transients, as re-\nported by Fasel et al., and for magnetopause FTE events, as\nreported by Lockwood and Wild. From the ground-based op-\ntical observations, global UV images and radar observations,\nevents are found to be typically 100\u2013300 km in latitudinal\nwidth and to vary in longitudinal extent up to about 2000 km\n(Lockwood et al., 1990; 1993a; Pinnock et al., 1995; Milan\net al., 2000). Such dimensions and the repetition rates mean\nthat these events are major, and sometimes the dominant\ndrivers of convection (Lockwood et al., 1993a; 1995b; Milan\net al., 2000).\n1.2 Cusp ion steps\nAnother predicted signature of pulsed reconnection are\ndiscontinuities in the dispersion of injected solar wind\nions in the cusp region, called \u201ccusp ion steps\u201d (Cow-\nley et al., 1991b; Lockwood and Smith, 1992, 1994; Escou-\nbet et al., 1992; Lockwood and Davis, 1996). These were\nfirst reported in low-altitude satellite data by Newell and\nMeng (1991). An important part of the prediction of these\nevents was the model of ionospheric flow excitation by Cow-\nley and Lockwood (1992) which predicts that patches of\nnewly-opened flux would be appended directly adjacent to\neach other. Periods of low or zero reconnection rate be-\ntween pulses give discontinuous steps in the ion dispersion\ncharacteristics at the boundaries between these patches: this\nis due to the discontinuous change in time elapsed since\nthe field line was reconnected. Modelling of the effects of\npulsed magnetopause reconnection has been shown to re-\nproduce the observed simultaneous steps in both downward\nM. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated observations of transient poleward-moving events 1591\nmoving and upward moving ions in the cusp at middle al-\ntitudes, unambiguously demonstrating that these events are\ncaused by pulsed reconnection and not by pulsed plasma\ntransfer across the magnetopause (Lockwood et al., 1998).\nCusp ion steps have been seen in association with poleward-\nmoving patches of elevated electron temperature (detected\nby incoherent scatter radar) by Lockwood et al. (1993b),\nwith poleward-moving cusp\/cleft auroral transients by Far-\nrugia et al. (1998) and with poleward-moving flow chan-\nnel events by Yeoman et al. (1997). Pinnock et al. (1995)\nfound some poleward-moving flow channels (detected by HF\nradar) were in association with a seemingly different \u201csaw-\ntooth\u201d signature in the cusp ions. However, modelling by\nLockwood and Davis (1996) showed that this sawtooth sig-\nnature was, in fact, the same phenomenon as the cusp ion\nsteps seen by Lockwood et al. (1993b), with the differences\narising purely from the longitudinal, as opposed to the more\nmeridional nature of the satellite pass. Recently, Morley and\nLockwood (2001) have pointed out that for a general satel-\nlite orbit orientation, the form of the dispersion also depends\non the amplitude of the reconnection rate pulses: sawtooth\nsignatures will become stepped signatures as the amplitude\nincreases.\n1.3 Polar cap patches\nThe enhanced 630 nm emission in poleward-moving\ncusp\/cleft transients is caused by the hot tail of a heated\nthermal electron population (Wickwar and Kofman, 1984;\nLockwood et al., 1993a). The magnetosheath electron\nprecipitation is responsible for that heating, but not for the\ndirect excitation of the emission. Emission intensity is also\nenhanced by higher ionospheric plasma concentration, and\nthis too can result in more particles in the hot tail of the\ndistribution with sufficient energy to cause excitation of the\n630 nm emission. Patches of enhanced plasma concentration\nconvecting anti-sunward are a common feature of the polar\ncap during southward IMF (Weber et al., 1984; Sojka et\nal., 1993, 1994, McEwen and Harris, 1996). These are seen\nconvecting through the cusp\/cleft region and into the polar\ncap (Foster and Doupnik, 1984; Foster, 1989; Lockwood and\nCarlson, 1992; Valladares et al., 1994; Prikryl et al., 1999a, b)\nand thus, it is likely that they are the fossil remnants of the\npoleward-moving cusp\/cleft transient events.\n1.4 The minima separating transient events\nOne major unresolved question about both poleward-moving\n630 nm cusp\/cleft transients and polar cap patches is why\nminima (in luminosity and plasma concentration, respec-\ntively) are seen between them. The successful theory of\nthe cusp ion precipitation is based on the concept that each\nnewly-opened field line evolves in a similar manner, such that\nthe ion characteristics depend only on the time elapsed since\nreconnection. Although pulsed reconnection gives the dis-\ncontinuities in their energy dispersion within the cusp\/cleft\nregion, magnetosheath ions are found in a single contiguous\nregion of newly-opened field lines and one would expect this\nto also be true of the injected magnetosheath electron pop-\nulation. Thus, on its own, this model does not explain the\nminima between events and an additional mechanism must\nbe invoked (Davis and Lockwood, 1996). A variety of candi-\ndate mechanisms have been proposed.\nLockwood and Carlson (1992) interpreted the concentra-\ntion variations, using the model of ionospheric convection\nexcitation by Cowley and Lockwood (1992) (which led to\nthe prediction of cusp ion steps), as the result of changes\nin the pattern of flow modulating the entry into the polar\ncap of the EUV-produced sub-auroral plasma. However,\nRodger et al. (1994a, c) pointed out that plasma produc-\ntion by soft particle precipitation (Whitteker, 1977; Water-\nmann et al., 1992; Davis and Lockwood, 1996; Millward et\nal., 1999) and plasma loss by enhanced electric fields and re-\naction rates (Schunk et al., 1975; Jenkins, 1997; Balmforth\net al., 1998, 1999) must also be significant factors in intro-\nducing structure into the plasma concentrations on the time\nscales for flux tubes to enter the polar cap. In time-varying\ncases, it may be possible for some flux tubes entering the po-\nlar cap to have undergone one or both of these processes to\na greater degree than others. Lockwood et al. (2000) argued\nthat variation may also be brought about by local time vari-\nations in the injected magnetosheath electron population and\nin the tension force on the newly-opened field lines, provided\nthat the events are sufficiently extensive in longitude. An-\nother possibility, modelled by Davis and Lockwood (1996),\nis that the electron precipitation spectrum hardens in regions\nof upward field-aligned currents, such that the underlying\nE-region is enhanced rather than the F-region. Lockwood\net al. (1993a; 2001b) have presented evidence that this does\noccur in the expected locations since both green line and\nUV auroral transients on the relevant edge of the patches on\nnewly-opened flux can be identified.\nThe present paper considers another potential explanation\nthat has not been considered previously. It presents the first\nobservations of ionospheric polar cap patches that can be\nassociated with electron flux variations in the high-altitude\nmantle region, i.e. near the sunward edge of the tail lobe at\na geocentric distance of around 10 RE (a mean Earth radius,\n1 RE = 6370 km). These data strongly imply that some of\nthe patches are produced by modulations in the lowest energy\nof magnetosheath electrons, caused either by a potential bar-\nrier of varying amplitude at the magnetopause or by fluctua-\ntions in the electron spectrum present in the magnetosheath\nbefore the reconnection occurred. The IMF in the interval\nstudied was predominantly southward (Sect. 2.1). The iono-\nspheric measurements of patches are made by the EISCAT\nSvalbard radar (ESR), which tracked the patches as they mi-\ngrated poleward into the polar cap (Sect. 2.3). The lobe\nmeasurements were made by the four Cluster-2 spacecraft\n(Sect. 2.6). Low-altitude satellite data reveal cusp ion steps\n(Sect. 2.2). Data from the SuperDARN HF coherent radars\nand magnetometers also reveal fluctuations in the character-\nistic repeat period of the order of 10 min (Sect. 2.5).

Simultaneous measurements were\nmade using a wide array of ground-based instrumentation.\nAn overview of this pass and of the instrumentation deployed\nis given by Opgenoorth et al.

The magnetic footprint of\nthe Cluster spacecraft was mapped to the ionosphere using\nthe Tsyganenko T96 model with input conditions observed\nby ACE at 07:50 UT (IMF BX = \u22123 nT, BY = +2 nT,\nBZ = \u22123 nT, solar wind concentration Nsw = 2.0 cm\u22123\nand velocity Vsw = 400 km s\u22121, giving a dynamic pressure\nPsw = 0.6 nPa) and with the geomagnetic index of Dst = 0.\nThese input conditions are based on a derived propagation\ndelay from ACE to the magnetosphere of 75 min (see below).\nAlso shown in Fig. 1 are the two beams of the ESR (Mc-\nCrea and Lockwood, 1997), deployed pointing along the ge-\nomagnetic field line from Longyearbyen and with a 30\u25e6 ele-\nvation along the magnetic meridian to the north, and the pass\nof the low-altitude DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite\nProgram) F12 satellite, as it moved equatorward through the\ncusp, with the closest conjunction to Svalbard at 09:05 UT.\nFigure 2 presents three views of the Cluster orbit in Geo-\ncentric Solar Ecliptic (XGSE, YGSE, ZGSE) coordinates, along\nwith the mapped field lines of the type that gave the foot-\nprint shown in Fig. 1.

Field\nlines mapped to the local (northern) hemisphere are shown in\ngreen, and those mapped to the southern hemisphere are in\nred.\nBy about 9:00 UT, the Cluster spacecraft were in the\nmantle region of the northern tail lobe (see Opgenoorth et\nal., 2001, this issue) and were predicted by the field line\nmodel to be close to the L-shell sampled by the furthest\nrange gates of the low elevation ESR beam, but consider-\nably to the east (near 15:00 MLT, whereas the ESR beams are\nnear 12:00 MLT). At this time, the DMSP-F12 satellite inter-\nsected the cusp, very close to the ESR field-aligned beam\nat noon. Subsequently, the ESR beams rotated around to-\nward the 15:00 MLT meridian and the closest conjunction\nwith Cluster was at 12:22 UT, as predicted by this magnetic\nfield model. Cluster particle observations reveal that the\nfour spacecraft passed from the mantle region into the low-\nlatitude boundary layer (LLBL) at about 10:45 and into the\ndayside boundary plasma sheet (BPS) at around 11:00; these\nchanges appear to be a response to a northward turning of\nthe IMF, causing the dayside polar cap boundary to contract\npoleward and the magnetopause to expand outward (see be-\nlow). The exterior particle cusp and the magnetopause inter-\nsection observed later in the pass are discussed in the paper\nby Opgenoorth et al. (2001, this issue) and the transient en-\ntries of the satellites into the LLBL from the BPS between\n11:00 and 13:00 are studied by Lockwood et al. (2001a,\nthis issue). In the present paper, we concentrate on the data\ntaken between 08:00\u201309:30, including the close conjunction\nbetween the ESR and DMSP-F12 at 09:05. The low-altitude\nof DMSP-F12 (near 840 km) means that there is very little\nuncertainty in the time and position of its closest magnetic\nconjunction to the ESR (Lockwood and Opgenoorth, 1997).\nHowever, one must bear in mind the long distances over\nwhich field lines have been traced in Fig. 2 (using an aver-\naged empirical model that attempts to close all geomagnetic\nflux); the Cluster footprint locations are thus highly model\ndependent and give us only a rough indication of where the\nspacecraft were in relation to the ground-based instrumenta-\ntion and the DMSP-F12 pass.\nPanels (a), (b) and (c) of Fig. 3 give the three components\nof the IMF in GSM coordinates, as seen by the Advanced\nComposition Explorer (ACE) satellite near to the L1 point.\nOpgenoorth et al. (2001, this issue) report a very high cross-\ncorrelation of the clock angle of the magnetosheath field (in\nthe GSEZ\u2212Y plane), as seen by Cluster once it had emerged\nfrom the magnetosphere at about 15:00 UT, with the same an-\ngle seen by ACE. The conservation of clock angle across the\nbow shock means that the correlation coefficient is very high\nand very significant, and the lag of peak correlation (74 min.)\nis a good estimate of the propagation delay between ACE and\nthe magnetopause at 15:00 UT. In Fig. 3, we estimate the lag\nin a different manner for 7:00\u201312:00 by comparing the Z-\nand Y -components of the IMF, seen by ACE in GSM coordi-\nnates, with the X-component (northward) of the perturbation\nto the geomagnetic field 1BX, as seen by 5 ground-based\n20 10 0 -10 -20\nXGSE\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\nY G\nSE\n 00:00 UT\n2001\/01\/14\n 04:00 UT\n \n08:\n00 \nUT\n \n12\n:00\n UT\n \n16\n:00\n U\nT\n \n20\n:00\n U\nT\n20 10 0 -10 -20\nXGSE\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\nZ G\nSE\n 00:00 UT\n2001\/01\/14\n 04:00 UT\n \n08\n:00\n UT\n \n12\n:0\n0 \nUT\n \n16\n:0\n0 \nUT\n \n20\n:0\n0 \nUT\n-20 -10 0 10 20\nYGSE\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\nZ G\nSE\n \n00\n:00\n U\nT\n20\n01\n\/01\n\/14\n 04:00 UT\n 08:00 UT\n 12:00 UT\n 16:00 UT\n 20:00 UT\nFig. 2.

Lockwood et al.: Coordinated observations of transient poleward-moving events\nHopen (HOP, Fig. 3g), Bear Island (BJN, Fig. 3h), and\nTroms\u00f8 (TRO, Fig. 3j). A correlation with the IMF BY is\nexpected due to the Svalgaard-Mansurov effect, which is due\nto the magnetic curvature (\u201ctension\u201d) force on newly-opened\nfield lines, and also with the IMF BZ since it controls the\nproduction of such newly-opened field lines. The maximum\ncorrelation coefficients (with corresponding lags) of BY for\nNAL and LYR are 0.58 (73 min) and 0.55 (72 min), respec-\ntively. The corresponding numbers for IMF BZ , and NAL\nand LYR are 0.77 (76 min) and 0.71 (75 min), respectively.\nNote that the use of a 3-hour sliding window shows that the\nlag of peak correlation varies between about 70 and 80 min.\nBy using the Fischer-Z test for a significant difference in the\ncorrelation coefficient, we find the uncertainty in the lag at\nany one time is typically \u00b15 min. Figure 3d repeats the IMF\nBZ variation, this time on the same time axis as the iono-\nspheric measurements (parts e\u2013k), i.e. shifted by the best-fit\npropagation lag of 75 min.\nFigure 3 marks three periods of special interest: A, B and\nC. Allowing for the average lag of 75 min, these intervals\ncorrespond to 8:00\u20139:30 UT, 11:19\u201311:27 UT and 12:00\u2013\n12:20 UT, respectively, in the ionosphere. We will study pe-\nriod A in detail in this paper; periods B and C are the subject\nof a subsequent paper by Lockwood et al. (2001a, this issue).\nThe magnetic perturbations seen on the ground show con-\ntrol by both IMF BZ and BY . In both cases, the lag is slightly\nlonger for NAL, which is poleward of LYR, indicating a\npoleward motion. Deflections are considerably weaker at\nTroms\u00f8, placing the open-closed field-line boundary (OCB)\nsomewhere between there and Bear Island, which is consis-\ntent with particle observations by DMSP-F12 (see next sec-\ntion).\nFigure 3 shows that throughout interval A (08:00\u2013\n09:30 UT in the ionosphere), the IMF was predominantly\nsouthward with a BZ component in GSM primarily in the\nrange between \u22122 and \u22124 nT, with only brief northward ex-\ncursions. The BX component is negative throughout, and the\nBY component is negative for the majority of this interval,\nbut with some positive excursions. The solar wind data (not\nshown) reveal that the solar wind velocity Vsw during interval\nA was roughly constant (varying between 365 and 400 km\/s,\nbut close to 368 km\/s for the majority of the time). The av-\nerage number density Nsw was initially 6 \u00b7 106 m\u22123, falling\nto a minimum of about 2 \u00b7 106 m\u22123 (at the 08:00 observation\ntime, 09:15 lagged time) before rising again to 5 \u00b7 106 m\u22123\nby the end of the interval. The fluctuations in the average dy-\nnamic pressure, Psw =< mi > NswV 2sw (where < mi > is\nthe mean ion mass) primarily follow those in Nsw and thus,\nalso show a variation (50% about the mean of 1.1 nPa in in-\nterval A). Subsequently, Psw fell even further, so by intervals\nB and C, it was only 0.6 nPa on average; for comparison, the\nmode value of the overall distribution of Psw is close to 3 nPa\n(Hapgood et al., 1991).\nFigure 3j shows the transpolar voltage deduced by fitting\nan IMF-dependent potential contour model to the line-of-\nsight velocity data from the SuperDARN radars (Ruohoniemi\net al., 1989). The effect of the northward turning of the IMF\nis seen just before 11:00 as a decrease in transpolar voltage\nand an increase in 1BX at all stations. In the 2-minute volt-\nage data shown in Fig. 3i, 17 peaks can be defined between\n08:00 and 11:00 UT. Each can be associated with a minimum\nin the 1BX at BJN and HOP, and these data series give a re-\npeat interval of the order of 10 min (as seen in the ESR data\nfor the same interval, see Sect. 2.3).\nFigure 3 stresses that the responses to the IMF changes\nwith a lag of 75(\u00b15) min were seen at a range of latitudes\nat the MLT of the ESR and also in the transpolar voltage.\nIt can be seen that around the time of Fig. 1 and the cusp\ncrossing by DMSP-F12 (09:05\u201309:07 UT, marked by a dot-\ndashed line in Fig. 3), neither BY nor BZ were stable in their\npolarity. To within the lag uncertainty of \u00b15 min, we can\ndefine the appropriate average IMF conditions to have been\nBX = \u22123 nT, BY = +2 nT, BZ = \u22123 nT.\n2.2 DMSP-F12 observations\nFigure 4 shows energy-time spectrograms (a) for electrons\nand (b) for ions, as observed by the Defense Meteorological\nSatellite Program (DMSP)-F12 spacecraft as it passed along\nthe path given in Fig. 1. In both cases, the differential energy\nflux is plotted as a function of energy (increasing upward)\nand observation time. Before the satellite entered the polar\ncap, it passed through an auroral oval showing a series of\ninverted-V electron arcs at 08:59\u201309:02 UT. It then entered\nthe polar cap at a magnetic latitude close to 71\u25e6 and an MLT\nof 17:00. The purple line in Fig. 4c shows the horizontal con-\nvection velocity perpendicular to the satellite track and this\nchanged from sunward to weakly anti-sunward close to the\npoleward edge of this auroral oval. The satellite was then\nbriefly within the polar cap precipitation region until about\n09:03, when it began to observe mantle precipitation and at\n09:05, it observed cusp ions and electrons which persisted\nuntil 09:07. The cusp was seen between magnetic latitudes\nof 73.7\u201375.9\u25e6, over the MLT range 13:54\u201312.12 hrs. Within\nthe cusp, convection flows were anti-sunward, stronger and\nhighly structured. The green line in Fig. 4c shows that in the\ncusp, vertical flows were structured, pointing upward around\n500 m\/s, but were downward in the polar cap. The thicker\nsegments of the pass shown in Fig. 1 mark the locations\nwhere DMSP-F12 observed the dusk auroral oval and the\ncusp.\nThe magnetosheath ions show a structured dispersion.\nThis structure is not as straightforward as the examples pre-\nsented by Newell and Meng (1991), Lockwood et al. (1993b)\nand Pinnock et al. (1995); nevertheless, clear upward dis-\ncontinuities can be seen in the cusp ion lower cutoff en-\nergy, Eic. The first major discontinuity is an upward step\nin Eic, consistent with a stepped cusp. This is followed by\na fall and subsequent rise in Eic, which is not fully con-\nsistent with either a stepped or a sawtooth cusp ion signa-\nture. Thereafter, the cusp takes on the classic sawtooth ap-\npearance with a gradual fall in Eic followed by an upward\nstep and then two isolated patches of the higher energy cusp\nions, showing features that were all observed by Pinnock et\nM.

(1995) and modelled by Lockwood and Davis (1996). We\nwould expect a sawtooth signature for such a longitudinal\ncusp pass in the presence of pulsed reconnection, unless the\nreconnection pulses have very small amplitude (Morley and\nLockwood, 2001). The evolution of the cusp ion signature\nshown in Fig. 4b reveals reconnection pulses that were ini-\ntially small, and then subsequently grew in amplitude. The\nsawtooth dispersion is seen to extend to the high-energy elec-\ntrons; magnetospheric BPS electrons were seen at energies\nabove 1 keV at almost exactly the same time that the magne-\ntosheath electrons (below 1 keV) disappeared (defining the\n\u201celectron edge\u201d, Gosling et al., 1990; Onsager et al., 1993;\nOnsager and Lockwood, 1997). However, these BPS elec-\ntrons subsequently disappeared again in a dispersed manner\n(higher energies disappearing first) before reappearing, at all\nenergies simultaneously, just after 09:08. Although not un-\ncommon in cusp ions, this is the first time that such a saw-\ntooth signature has been reported to extend into electron data:\nit is clearly seen in this case due to of the increasing ampli-\ntude of the reconnection pulses, with the pulse that provides\nthe electron sawtooth representing the largest of the series.\nGiven that electrons travel very quickly down field lines, we\ncan identify the location of the electron edge as very close\nto the open-closed boundary (OCB) (see Lockwood, 1997a);\nthe onset of energetic magnetospheric electrons marks the\npassage of the satellite from open to closed field lines. The\nOCB then erodes equatorward in response to a reconnec-\ntion pulse which is sufficiently large enough in amplitude\nto cause the OCB to overtake the satellite. This, in turn,\ncauses the electrons to disappear, with the most energetic\nelectrons escaping first through the magnetopause. Subse-\nquently, the equatorward motion of the OCB slowed, allow-\ning the satellite to overtake it again, and causing the BPS\nelectrons to reappear at all energies. These data not only\nshow that reconnection was pulsed, but also show the loca-\ntion of the OCB near 12:00 MLT oscillating in invariant lati-\ntude between 71.5\u25e6 and 73.7\u25e6 in the interval 09:07\u2013 9:08 UT.\nThis places the ESR field-aligned beam (at invariant latitude\n75.1\u25e6) on open field lines within (but near the poleward edge)\nthe cusp, as seen by DMSP-F12.\n2.3 EISCAT Svalbard radar observations\nFigure 5 shows 2-minute post-integrations of the ESR radar\nobservations of plasma concentration in the interval 07:15\u2013\n11:45 UT.

(The contour\nlevels are given by the scale shown for the top panel of Fig. 6). Lines map the centres of poleward-moving events seen in the low-elevation\nbeam back to the invariant latitude of 75.1\u25e6 of the field-aligned beam.\nplasma regions (polar cap \u201cpatches\u201d) moving along the beam\nto higher latitudes. These are similar to those seen by lower-\nlatitude radars (Chatanika and the EISCAT UHF and VHF\nmainland radars), using similar modes of operation with\npoleward-pointing beams at low elevation, but only when the\npolar cap is considerably expanded (e.g. Foster and Doup-\nnik, 1984, Lockwood and Carlson, 1992). Since their pole-\nward phase motion was roughly constant in speed, a straight\nline can be placed through each of these events. These lines\nhave been mapped back to an invariant latitude of 75.1\u25e6, rep-\nresenting the location of the field-aligned ESR beam. Fig. 5\nshows that the events seen in the field-aligned beam gener-\nally match those subsequently seen propagating poleward in\nthe low-elevation beam. The relationship of similar events in\nthe ESR field-aligned beam to phenomena, such as poleward\nmoving flow channels seen by the CUTLASS HF radar and\npoleward-moving 630 nm auroral transients, has been stud-\nied by McCrea et al. (2000) and Lockwood et al. (2000).\nThis match between the plasma concentration data seen\nin the two ESR beams persists until the first effects of the\nnorthward turning of the IMF, shown in Fig. 3, reaches the\nmagnetosphere at around 10:45. Thereafter, the signatures\ndo not correspond and they do not share a common origin\n(Blelly et al., 2001, private communication). While patches\nare passing over both beams, the field-aligned beam gives a\ndetailed picture of the altitude profile of the plasma param-\neters in each event as it passes over the radar, as presented\nin Fig. 6. These data have a lower post-integration time of\n1 min which is the optimum compromise between the time\nresolution and the signal-to-noise ratio for the field-aligned\nbeam. The altitude profiles of the events show that most of\nthe plasma concentration (Ne) enhancements were primarily\nabove 150 km (top panel Fig. 6); this altitude corresponds\nto about 76.5\u25e6 invariant latitude for the poleward-pointing\nbeam and thus, the events are not generally seen at lower\nlatitudes since the low elevation beam is underneath the Ne\nevents close to the radar. Similarly, the enhancement is small\nabove about 600 km and so altitude effects also indicate that\nevents are not generally detected at invariant latitudes above\nabout 82\u25e6. By taking the time series of the data observed in\nthe range gate of the two beams that are at a 300 km altitude,\nand cross-correlating with a 1-hour running window, gives\ncross-correlation coefficients between 0.75 and 0.9. (These\nfall to lower values if longer windows are used due to of the\nvariations in the poleward phase speed of the events).\nThe lower panels of Fig. 6 show the electron tempera-\nture, Te, the field-aligned ion temperature [Ti]\u2016 and the field-\naligned ion velocity, V\u2016. The electron temperatures, Te, seen\nin the field-aligned beam were higher and more structured\nwhen the IMF was southward (average values at 300 km, for\nexample, were about 3000 K, compared to about 1500 K af-\nter 11:00, when the IMF was predominantly northward (see\n1598 M.

The parallel ion tem-\nperatures, [Ti]\u2016, showed brief transient enhancements (up to\n3000 K, compared with to the background level of 1300 K)\nand persistent fast, upward flows (with speeds V\u2016 of 300 m\/s\nor more at 500 km) were also observed, but when the IMF\nwas southward.\nThe ion temperature behaviour is dominated by the largest\ntwo terms in the ion thermal balance equation (Lockwood et\nal., 1993d; McCrea et al., 1993) such that the field-parallel\nion temperature is:\n[Ti]\u2016 = Tn + \u03b2\u2016mn2k |V \u2212 U |\n2 , (1)\nwhere Tn is the temperature and mn is the mean mass of the\nneutral gas atoms\/molecules; \u03b2\u2016 is the temperature partition\ncoefficient; k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant; V and U are the ion\nand neutral gas velocity vectors, respectively. The coefficient\n\u03b2\u2016 has a minimum value of zero (the \u201crelaxation model\u201d of\nion-neutral collisions which would be valid for charge ex-\nchange with no momentum exchange) and a maximum value\nof 2\/3 (for isotropic scattering). A lower \u03b2\u2016 corresponds to\na higher temperature anisotropy. McCrea et al. (1993) found\nthat \u03b2\u2016 was about 1\/3 near 300 km, but rose to values closer\nto 2\/3 at greater altitudes since the isotropising effects of ion-\nion collisions became as important as the anisotropic heating\neffect of ion-neutral collisions. At the highest altitudes, heat\nconduction from the electron to the ion gas may become im-\nportant since electron temperatures are generally higher. The\nfact that \u03b2\u2016 > 0 means that differences between V and U re-\nsult in rises in [Ti]\u2016 that can be detected by the field-aligned\nESR beam. Recently, Lockwood et al. (2000) have stud-\nied ESR observations of ion heating in and around transient\npoleward-moving events, as seen by optical instruments and\nthe CUTLASS HF radars. They found that the behaviour de-\npends on the time in the evolution of events at which the radar\nintersects them. This occurs because the enhanced ion flows\nV in the events evolve as they change from moving longitudi-\nnally under the magnetic curvature force (\u201ctension\u201d), associ-\nated with the IMF BY component, to poleward motion under\nthe influence of the solar wind flow (Lockwood et al., 1989a,\nb), whereas the neutral flows U can only show an average\nresponse to these changing ion flows. This introduces great\nvariability into the ion temperatures caused by ion frictional\nheating, even if the interplanetary conditions are stable.\nIn the interval 07:15\u201310:50, 19 poleward-moving events\nwere seen in the 2-min resolution data from the field-aligned\nESR beam (Fig. 5), all of which can be subsequently iden-\ntified in the poleward-pointing beam. This gives an average\nrepetition interval of the order of 10 min. Figure 6 shows\nthe 1-min integrated data for the field-aligned beam for the\ninterval A, and an additional 8 events can be seen in these\nM.

Of these, event 7a appears to be caused by a bad fit\nto the data; it is only present in one post-integration period,\nThe altitude profile in Ne is unlike that in any other event and\nanomalous values are also seen in Te, [Ti]\u2016 and V\u2016. Neglect-\ning 7a means that we identify a total of 14 events in these\ndata in interval A, giving a mean repeat period of 6.4 min,\nwhich is considerably less than the 10 min derived from the\n2-min integrated data and from the poleward beam.\nFigure 6 reveals that the signatures in the various parame-\nters measured (Ne, Te, [Ti]\u2016 and V\u2016) have complex relation-\nships and indicate that a number of factors may have con-\ntributed to the observed structure in the plasma concentra-\ntion. Events 6, 8a, 8c,10 and 10a show decreases in electron\ntemperature Te coincident with the rises in Ne. Events 8b,\n8c and 9 show (generally weak) simultaneous rises in field-\nparallel ion temperature [Ti]\u2016. However, the major rises in\n[Ti]\u2016 are between events (e.g. between 6a and 7, 7 and 8, 8c\nand 9). Event 9 (which shows highNe, Te and [Ti]\u2016) reveals a\nstrong burst of upflow velocity, V\u2016, and hence, ion flux NeV\u2016.\nFigure 7 plots the phase velocity of the poleward motion\nof the events, Ve (from the slope of the fitted lines in the\ntop panel of Fig. 5). The events are plotted at the time that\nthey are at an invariant latitude of 79\u25e6 and selected events\nhave been numbered for comparison with Fig. 5. Events after\n11:00 (21\u201332) are discussed by Lockwood et al. (2001a). It\nshould be noted that three factors enter into the values of Ve:\nthe poleward convection speed, the orientation of the events\nand the east-west convection speed. Thus, Ve depends on\nboth the BY and BZ components of the IMF, and the orien-\ntation of the events will evolve systematically as the radar\nmoves from near noon in MLT into the mid-afternoon sector.\n2.4 Magnetometer observations\nFigure 8d shows the \u201cupward continuation\u201d of the X-com-\nponent of the magnetic field BX \u2032 (derived as a function of\nlatitude from the IMAGE magnetometer chain). The tech-\nnique used employs Fourier analysis of the data from the lat-\nitudinal chain of stations on the ground to reconstruct high-\nresolution latitude variations that would have been observed\njust below the current layer (Mersmann et al., 1976). A pos-\nitive X-component (northward) is a response to an eastward\ncurrent. If the magnetometers are responding to a Hall cur-\nrent in the E-region (i.e. if horizontal stratification of con-\nductivities can be assumed), this corresponds to a westward\nconvection velocity in the F-region. Note that the yellow and\nred colours reveal positive BX \u2032 (eastward current), whereas\ngreen and blue reveal negative BX \u2032 (westward current). Parts\n(a), (b) and (c) of Fig. 8 give the lagged (by 75 min) varia-\ntions of the IMF components in the GSM reference frame.\nThe dashed lines give the events identified in Fig. 6. The\nhorizontal line is the latitude of the field-aligned ESR beam.\nNote that all events were seen while the IMF was southward.\nBetween 8:00 and 8:25 (roughly 10:45\u201311:10 MLT), weak\nwestward current was seen poleward of a stronger eastward\ncurrent. In this interval, the lagged IMF was strongly south-\nward with a weak negative BY component. Thus, this is con-\nsistent with the magnetometer chain spanning the convection\nreversal of the dawn cell for IMF BY < 0. Note that the cur-\nrents were not steady \u2013 5 enhancements seen in the eastward\ncurrent during this 25 min. In this interval, events 5a, 5b and\n6 were identified from the radar data, however, no clear cor-\nrespondence with the BX \u2032 variations is apparent.\nBetween 08:25 and 09:30, BX \u2032 oscillated between this sit-\nuation (westward current poleward of eastward current) and\nthe reverse situation (eastward current poleward of westward\ncurrent). The latter is consistent with the chain straddling\nthe convection reversal of the dawn cell for IMF BY > 0.\nThe IMF data reveal several reversals of the polarity of IMF\nBY in this interval. For 09:03\u201309:19, the current is east-\nward at all latitudes, consistent with the chain moving into\nthe dusk cell for IMF BY > 0. The plasma concentration\n(Ne) enhancement events seen by the ESR in this interval\ncan all be associated with either oscillations in the form of\nthe BX \u2032 latitude variation or with a transient enhancement of\nBX\n\u2032\n. Thus, there is structure in the detected currents that is\nbroadly associated with the Ne events, although the associ-\nation is not straightforward since the BX \u2032 signatures have a\nvariety of forms. This is perhaps not surprising considering\nthe variations in IMF BY and BZ (Fig. 3), and the effects this\nwill have on BX \u2032. In addition, the competing effects of mag-\nnetosheath precipitation, the enhanced loss rates associated\nwith ion-neutral frictional heating and the effect of event evo-\nlution (Lockwood et al., 2000) will introduce variations into\nthe form of the Ne events; this fact is reflected in the range of\nbehaviours of Te, [Ti]\u2016 and V\u2016 during the Ne enhancements.\n1600 M.

The ver-\ntical dashed lines give the times of the\npeaks in the Ne events defined in Fig. 6.\n2.5 Convection observations\nFigure 1 shows a 5-min integration convection pattern in an\ninvariant latitude (3), with the MLT frame at 09:05. This\nhas been derived by the AMIE technique, employing magne-\ntometer, SuperDARN, DMSP and ESR observations. This is\nthe time of the closest approach of the DMSP-F12 satellite\nto the ESR and marks the start of the cusp intersection (cusp\nions are seen at 09:05\u201309:07 and the electron edge is encoun-\ntered three times during the interval 09:07\u201309:08). The flows\nshow a southward IMF flow pattern, with a transpolar voltage\nof 54 kV. A similar value for the transpolar voltage and flow\npattern is obtained for this time using model fitting to Super-\nDARN line-of-sight velocity data (Ruohoniemi et al., 1989,\nRuohoniemi and Baker. 1998). The flow in the cusp region is\ndirected towards dawn (westward), which is characteristic of\na positive IMF BY for these northern hemisphere data (e.g.\nHeelis et al., 1984). With the inferred lag of 75 min for this\ninterval, the relevant IMF data were recorded by ACE at 7:50.\nFigure 3 shows that the IMF BY component in GSM was in-\ndeed positive at this time, with negative IMF BZ . At other\ntimes in interval A, the IMF BY was weakly negative and\nthen the flow streamlines in the dayside polar cap were close\nto poleward with only a small eastward component. At such\nM. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated observations of transient poleward-moving events 1601\ntimes, the flow streamlines that passed over the ESR were\ncloser to Cluster than seen in Fig. 1, in which the path of the\nDMSP-F12 satellite in this (3) - MLT frame is also plotted.\nThe thicker segments of the path mark where the DMSP-F12\nwas in the dusk auroral oval (observing a sunward flow) and\nin the cusp (observing a structured anti-sunward flow). While\nwithin the polar cap, between these two segments, DMSP-\nF12 observed weak anti-sunward flow (see Fig. 4). The flows\nare consistent with the inference from the upward continua-\ntion magnetic disturbance, BX \u2032, as plotted in Fig. 8, with an\neastward current at all latitudes showing that the magnetome-\nter chain is in the dusk convection cell at this time. However,\nthe BX \u2032 variation before and after the pass reveals the chain\nmoving out of, and then back into a dawn cell. This is con-\nsistent with the zero-potential contour between the two cells\nlying close to the meridian of Svalbard, as seen in Fig. 1,\nwhere the locations of the two ESR beams can also be seen.\nConvection is poleward, consistent with the poleward phase\nmotion of the events, but at this time, it has a westward com-\nponent that is of the same order of magnitude as the poleward\nflow.\nFigure 9 summarises some of the line-of-sight flow ob-\nservations made on the dayside at a 2-min resolution by the\nSuperDARN radars. Each part shows a map of the dayside\nin geographic coordinates with noon at the top and the day-\nnight terminator as shown. The vectors shown point along\nthe beams where scatter was observed, and they have a length\nand polarity that is scaled according to the line-of-sight ve-\nlocity. They are also colour-coded according to the magni-\ntude of the observed line-of-sight velocity. Note that these\nare not 2-dimensional convection vectors. The DMSP-F12\npass is shown in the same format as Fig. 1, with the addi-\ntion of a red arrow that gives the location of the satellite at\nthat time. The yellow dot is the field-aligned ESR beam. At\n09:01 UT (Fig. 9a), enhanced flows are seen in the polar cap\n(in red) and this patch subsequently migrates anti-sunward\nand fades in magnitude and size. A small patch of enhanced\npoleward flow is seen around the ESR. This has faded by\n09:05 (Fig. 9b) but another patch to the west of the radar has\nappeared by 09:09 (Fig. 9c). This subsequently spreads east-\nward over the ESR (09:17, Fig. 9d). Note that the lagged\nIMF data shows positive IMF BY for almost all of the inter-\nval covered by Fig. 9 (Fig. 3) and the vector flow in the cusp\nis correspondingly westward (Fig. 1). Thus, the eastward ex-\npansion is not due to the curvature force on newly-opened\nfield lines and is likely to reflect an eastward expansion or\nmotion of the reconnection X-line. A decay in this enhanced\nflow starts near noon and spreads both east and west, such\nthat by 09:21 (Fig. 9e), the enhanced flows are seen only in\nthe mid-morning and mid-afternoon sectors. This behaviour\nis as predicted by Lockwood (1994) for an active X-line that\nforms near noon and then expands and bifurcates, giving ac-\ntive segments travelling toward both dawn and dusk. The\ndata also reveal a convection reversal boundary (CRB), seen\nas a reversal of the line-of-sight flow from toward to away\nfrom the radar. This is near 75\u25e6 in the morning sector and\nclose to the satellite pass in the afternoon. By 09:27 (Fig. 9f),\nthe enhancement is not seen at all, and the CRB has migrated\npoleward in the morning sector, but not in the afternoon sec-\ntor.\n2.6 Global auroral observations\nThe flow streamlines in Fig. 1 are superposed on the relevant\nglobal auroral image taken by the Wideband Imaging Cam-\nera (WIC) of the FUV instrument on the IMAGE spacecraft\n(Mende et al., 2000). This imager covers the ultraviolet range\nof wavelengths between 140 and 180 nm with temporal reso-\nlution of 2 min. The original image was taken from a geocen-\ntric distance of 50 200 km and was remapped to a local time\nand geomagnetic latitude grid. The UV aurora is primarily\nobserved in the regions of upward field-aligned current asso-\nciated with the pattern of convection (the region 2 at dawn,\non the equatorward edge of the convection boundary, and the\nregion 1 at dusk, close to the convection reversal boundary).\nThe DMSP-F12 satellite is poleward of the auroral oval when\nin the region defined as the polar cap from the precipitation\ncharacteristics.\nThe WIC camera is primarily sensitive to aurora created\nby electron precipitation, which when measured by DMSP\nin the cusp, showed very low characteristic energy (below\n300 eV) and when combined with the small differential en-\nergy flux, this precipitation only produced a very weak signal\nfrom the cusp region. Even the electron precipitation mea-\nsured by DMSP at around 09:09 with higher characteristic\nenergies (several keV) was not intense enough and a gap ap-\npeared in the dayside aurora. The FUV instrument on IM-\nAGE also contains the Spectrographic Imager (SI12) chan-\nnel, which measures the Doppler shifted Lyman-alpha emis-\nsion from precipitating protons (Mende et al., 2000). This\nimager is sensitive to emission from protons with at least\n2 keV energy. The high energy tail of the differential ion\nenergy flux (primarily protons) measured by DMSP created\nonly a very weak signal in the proton aurora imager from the\ncusp (not shown). At the first crossing of the auroral oval by\nDMSP at about 71\u25e6 magnetic latitude and 17:00 MLT (see\nSect. 2.2), the UV images confirm the location of the proton\nprecipitation equatorward of the most intense inverted V-like\nelectron precipitation.\n2.7 Cluster observations\nFigures 10b to 10e shows plasma observations made during\ninterval A by the Cluster spacecraft, and Fig. 10a reproduces\nthe Ne variation shown in Fig. 6a, shifted in time to obtain\nthe best agreement (see below). Figure 10b shows the space-\ncraft potential from the EFW instruments on all 4 spacecraft,\na measure of the plasma concentration around the spacecraft.\nThe spacecraft potential was held almost constant by the AS-\nPOC instruments which were active on spacecraft C3 and\nC4. However, close inspection revealed that for this case\nwith very low ambient plasma concentrations, the potential\nof C3 and C4 still varied about the almost constant value\ndue to the ambient plasma concentration variations.

Fitting the scatter plot with an exponential\nvariation gives an excellent fit in both cases and this was used\nto scale the data by C3 and C4, taken with ASPOC turned on,\ninto the values that would have been seen had ASPOC been\nturned off. Fig. 10b shows that the four spacecraft saw fluc-\ntuations in the plasma concentration in roughly 10-min time\nscales (9 in 90 min) that were almost identical, indicating that\nthe plasma structures were considerably larger than the inter-\ncraft separations of the order of 600 km.\nParts (c) to (e) of Fig. 10 analyse the nature of these plasma\nconcentration structures using data from spacecraft C3. Fig-\nures 10c and 10d show the data from the LEEA and HEEA\ndetectors on the PEACE instrument, respectively.

Events in both ion and electron data show relatively\nsudden onsets, followed by a slower decay. Figure 10c shows\nthat the fluxes of lowest energy magnetosheath electrons seen\nby LEEA (10\u201330 eV) are quite strongly modulated during\nthe events, and the lowest energy at which significant fluxes\nof such electrons are seen falls as the plasma concentration\nrises.\nIn comparing the plasma concentration structures seen by\nthe ESR and by the Cluster spacecraft, several points must\nbe remembered. In the 1.5 hours shown, the ESR moves in\nMLT from near 10:45 to 12:15, while Cluster remains close\nto 15:00 MLT. Conversely, the ESR remains at an invariant\nlatitude of 75.1\u25e6, while Cluster moves from near 85\u25e6 to 79\u25e6.\nThus, the separation of the two decreases by 1.5 hours in\nMLT and by about 6\u25e6 in invariant latitude. Thus, we do\nnot expect the propagation delay of any events that pass over\nboth to be constant, although it might vary approximately\nlinearly. Second, Cluster traverses much of the mantle in\nthis period and plasma concentrations increase correspond-\ningly, whereas the difference in latitude between the ESR\nand the open-closed boundary does not appear to drift very\nmuch. Thus, it is not surprising that events become succes-\nsively larger in amplitude in the Cluster data, but this trend\nis not found in the ESR data. In Fig. 10, the ESR data have\nbeen shifted forward in time by a lag that varies linearly with\ntime. The end of event 5 is matched up to the end of an event\nat 08:00 in the EFW data, and the small event 11 is matched\nup to the small event in the EFW data. This yields a lag of\n150 s at 08:00 and a lag of 244 s at 09:00 and gives an excel-\nlent match for events 9 and 10 in the Cluster data, and events\n8a and 7 are seen in the Cluster data but the lag appears to be\nslightly overestimated. Between events 8c and 9 is an event\nseen by EFW, but absent in the ESR data; however, inspec-\ntion of Fig. 6 reveals that [Ti]\u2016 is strongly elevated at this\ntime, indicating that the ionospheric enhancement may have\nbeen countered by enhanced plasma loss rates due to the fast\nplasma flow. Similar considerations apply to the minima be-\ntween events 7 and 8 and between events 6a and 7, and agree-\nment for events 6a to 8 is not very close.\nThe centre times of the ESR events are marked with\ndashed lines, as in Figs. 6 and 8. Given the changing sep-\naration between ESR and Cluster, and the complications as-\nsociated with flow enhanced ionospheric loss rates, the data\nsuggest a surprising correspondence between the two data\nsets.\n3 Discussion\nThe period studied here (08:00\u201309:30) reveals a series of\nevents with a repeat interval of the order of 10 min in a\nvariety of data sets. Higher resolution data reveals further\n(smaller) events providing a repeat period of about 6.5 min.\nThese values are similar to the average for the distribution\nof repeat periods for dayside auroral transients (Fasel, 1995),\nmagnetopause FTEs (Lockwood and Wild, 1993), poleward-\nmoving cusp\/cleft flow channels seen by HF radar (Provan\nand Yeoman, 1999; McWilliams et al., 2000) and polar cap\npatches (Sojka et al., 1994). Thus, they are consistent with a\ncharacteristic quasi-periodicity that is seen throughout the re-\ngion of dayside open field lines (cusp\/cleft, mantle and polar\ncap). The pass of the DMSP-F12 satellite around 09:05 UT\nreveals that the cusp and the electron edge were equatorward\nof both ESR radar beams, which were both on open field\nlines. Events were seen in the ionospheric plasma density\nin both beams; they were moving poleward along the low-\nelevation beam and by mapping these back in latitude when\nthe IMF was southward confirms that the same events were\nseen as they passed through the field-aligned beam. Compar-\nison with high-resolution magnetometer data indicates that\nthere are associated changes in ionospheric currents and con-\nvection, but these vary in their nature, almost certainly due to\nchanges in the IMF BY and BZ . The events were seen by the\nESR after only a very small lag following the corresponding\nenhancements of electron (and to a lesser extent ion) concen-\ntrations in the mantle region of the tail lobe, as monitored by\nCluster. The surprising result, therefore, is that there appears\nto be signatures of polar cap patches in the tail lobe particle\npopulations, as well as in the ionosphere.\n3.1 IMF control of events\nFigure 3a shows that the IMF at ACE was predominantly\nsouthward until 09:45, and we can identify the effects of the\nnorthward turning at this time with the change in the ground-\nbased magnetometer data (as shown in Fig. 3b for the IM-\nAGE chain, but also found in the Greenland magnetometer\nchain) at 11:00, consistent with the inferred propagation lag\nof 75 min at this time. The SuperDARN radar network also\nrevealed a drop in the transpolar voltage following the north-\nward turning (Fig. 3i). Thus, the events seen by the ESR\nbefore 11:00 are for predominantly southward IMF condi-\ntions. Brief periods of northward IMF were seen at ACE at\n07:29\u201307:32 and 07:51\u201307:54 which applying the 75 min lag\ngives times of 08:44\u201308:47 and 09:06\u201309:09. These intervals\ndo not appear to change the occurrence of the events seen by\nthe radar; however, at these times, between events 6 and 8,\nthere is a marked slowing in the phase speed of the poleward\nmotion of the events. This is clearly reflected in the phase ve-\nlocity of the poleward motion of the events, Ve (Fig. 6). Al-\nthough event velocities do generally decrease following the\narrival of northward IMF turnings at 08:45 and 10:45, there\nis no good overall correlation with IMF BZ . The IMF Bx\nwas negative throughout interval A, with BY negative for the\nmajority of the interval (between \u22123 and \u22121 nT) with a few\nexcursions to positive BY (to about +4 nT).\nStrong ion-neutral frictional heating (high [Ti]\u2016) is seen\nbetween some of the enhanced plasma concentration Ne\nevents, in particular, between events 6a and 7, 7 and 8, and 8c\nand 9. Figure 8 shows that these are associated with changes\nin the direction of the east-west current, as inferred from the\nupward continuation northward magnetic field BX \u2032, which,\nin turn, can be associated with changes in the polarity of the\nIMF BY component.\nM. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated observations of transient poleward-moving events 1605\n3.2 Implications for the causes of the polar cap patches\nThe source of F-region polar cap patches has been a subject\nof considerable debate (e.g. Rodger et al., 1994a, b, c; Lock-\nwood and Carlson,1992, 1994; Ogawa et al., 2001). Several\nclasses of theory have been proposed:\n(1) the density could be enhanced by the magnetosheath\nparticle precipitation (Whitteker, 1977; Watermann et\nal., 1992), such that the plasma concentration depends\non the time elapsed since the field line was reconnected.\nIn such cases, patches may be seen at one point, but only\nif the elapsed time since reconnection of the field lines\nmonitored varied quasi-periodically (Davis and Lock-\nwood, 1996). This does not give an explanation of the\nminima seen between events by imagers, meridian scan-\nning photometers and HF backscatter radars;\n(2) the minima between patches could have been produced\nby channels of enhanced flow which raise the plasma\nloss rate (Rodger et al., 1994a, c; Balmforth et al., 1998,\n1999) or by\n(3) a hardening of the electron precipitation spectrum in\nregions of upward field-aligned current (Lockwood et\nal., 1993a, 2001b; Davis and Lockwood, 1996);\n(4) the enhanced plasma within patches could be produced\nby solar EUV radiation in the sunlit sub-auroral region\nand moved into the polar cap by time-varying convec-\ntion in response to reconnection pulses (e.g. Lockwood\nand Carlson, 1992), in which case, the minima are due\nto the relative absence of that photoionisation in the his-\ntory of some flux tubes;\n(5) Lockwood et al. (2000) recently used a combination of\nthree of these models to explain some patches seen us-\ning the ESR, the Cutlass radars and optical instruments;\na large longitudinal extent of the reconnection site was\nan important part of this explanation.\nModel (1) predicts that the F-region plasma concentration,\nNe, and the electron temperature, Te, will be enhanced to-\ngether when they first form (this is not true further into\nthe polar cap because enhanced Ne persists, but Te decays\nrapidly when the magnetosheath electron precipitation de-\ncays away; see Watermann et al., 1992, 1994; Davis and\nLockwood, 1996). Model (2) predicts that high ion tempera-\ntures (including [Ti]\u2016) will be found within the gaps between\nthe events of higher Ne, at least where the gaps first form.\n(Again, further into the polar cap, enhanced [Ti]\u2016 would de-\ncay if the fast ion flows decay, but low Ne would remain as\na fossil of the remnant of the flow bust; see Balmforth et\nal., 1998, 1999). Model (3) predicts enhancements in the E-\nregion below the F-region depletion and, like model (1), pre-\ndicts that Ne and Te in the F-region will rise and fall in uni-\nson. Model (4) predicts that Te will fall where Ne rises, since\nthe same downward heat flux is shared among more iono-\nspheric particles. The ESR data shown in Fig. 6 offers some\nsupport for several of these concepts. First, when the IMF\nis southward, both Te and Ne in the F-region are enhanced\nalong the field-aligned ESR beam, showing the presence of\nsoft, magnetosheath-like electron precipitation. (This should\nbe compared with the situation after 11:15 when the IMF\nis generally northward and the cusp\/LLBL precipitation is\npoleward of the Longyearbyen field line, making both Te and\nNe lower; see Opgenoorth et al., 2001, this issue). More ob-\nvious structure is seen in Ne than in Te, but this is consistent\nwith the modelling of Davis and Lockwood (1996) for a radar\nlocation that is not too close to the open-closed boundary but\nstill within the cusp region. These events, like those reported\nby Ogawa et al. (2001), do not show an association with rises\nin [Ti]\u2016. However, other events do show strongly enhanced\n[Ti]\u2016 in the Ne minima between two events. In fact, the ab-\nsence of such a rise in [Ti]\u2016 is not inconsistent with model\n(2) since the rapid flows causing the heating could have sub-\nsided, leaving a \u201cfossil\u201d trough between events. Third, there\nare some cases in which there are minima in Te coincident\nwith the peaks in Ne and the changes in the flow that one\nneeds to invoke patches of enhancedNe are seen to be present\nin the high resolution magnetometer data.\nFigure 10 indicates that the patches seen in the high-\naltitude mantle (at geocentric distance of about 10RE , see\nFig. 1) may be closely related to the ionospheric Ne patches.\nThe repeat periods are similar in the two datasets and, with\nthe inclusion of a small but variable lag, we can make an as-\nsociation between the two sets of data in those cases where\nflow changes do not appear to be a major factor. This poses\ninteresting new questions for the models of patch production.\nIn particular, the enhancements seen by the ESR at the great-\nest altitudes appear to be related to variations in the flux of\nthe softest electrons. This strongly implies that these patches\nwere produced by modulations in the precipitation magne-\ntosheath electrons.\nAn important point is that the ESR and Cluster are well\nseparated at this time. Thus, if the relationship implied by\nFig. 10 is real and events do indeed pass over both, this re-\nquires that the events be large (covering over 4 hrs of MLT,\ni.e. > 1200 km). For the flow pattern shown in Fig. 1, it\nis certainly possible that events formed along the afternoon\nsector open-closed boundary could pass over the Cluster and\nESR field lines at similar times (the best-fit lag in Fig. 10 is\n2.5 min at 08:00 and 4 min at 09:00). Second, if the vari-\nations in the precipitating magnetosheath electron flux are\na contributory cause of the patches, then they cannot be a\nfunction of elapsed time since reconnection, as this would\nyield a relatively static region of enhanced Ne through which\nnewly-opened field lines convect. Rather, the convection of\npatches into the polar cap with the newly-opened field lines\nrequires that the electron flux enhancement persists on some\nfield lines (i.e. within the patch) but is always absent from\nothers (i.e. in the gap between patches).\nThus, the variations could be caused by the concentration\nvariations in the source magnetosheath plasma, giving rise\nto variations in the fluxes injected into the magnetosphere.\nThis being the case, polar cap patches would be seen if the\nreconnection was steady or pulsed, and flux increases would\n1606 M. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated observations of transient poleward-moving events\nbe seen in both injected ions and electrons. The CIS data\ndo reveal changes in the fluxes of the magnetosheath ions\nduring this period, although they are not as distinct as in the\nlow-energy electron data and a one-to-one correspondence is\nnot always found. Furthermore, this mechanism does not ex-\nplain the cusp ion steps and the transient changes in the flow\nseen by the SuperDARN HF radars and the magnetometers.\nThus, magnetosheath plasma concentration fluctuations are,\nat most, only a partial explanation.\nA key unanswered question in understanding the be-\nhaviour of the electron gas relates to how the observed\nquasi-neutrality is maintained along newly-opened field lines\non which magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasma is\nmixing after reconnection (Burch, 1985). Several authors\nhave found evidence for a potential barrier at the magne-\ntopause that appears to hold back the lowest energy mag-\nnetosheath electrons (Wing et al., 1996; Lockwood and Hap-\ngood, 1997, 1998). Furthermore, electrons appear to undergo\nan unexplained heating when crossing the magnetopause\nalong open field lines (Onsager et al., 2001) and the mirrored\npart of the bi-directional streams of strahl electrons in the\nmagnetosphere does not appear to escape back into the mag-\nnetosheath across a magnetopause, even where the magne-\ntopause is known to be a rotational discontinuity threaded by\nthe field lines (Shirai et al., 1998). These various clues point\nto a process that modulates the magnetosheath electron flux\nand spectrum as it enters the magnetosphere and this may be\nrelevant to the low-energy electron flux variations shown in\nFig. 10.\n3.3 The role of pulsed magnetopause reconnection\nBoth the electron and ion dispersion data from the DMSP-\nF12 pass reveal the effects of pulses in the magnetopause\nreconnection rate. The electron observations reveal motions\nof the open-closed boundary between 09:07 and 09:08 that\nare consistent with a reconnection pulse and the structure in\nthe ion dispersion reveals that there were other reconnection\npulses prior to this. The evolution of a stepped dispersion\nto a sawtooth dispersion is consistent with an increase in\nthe amplitude of the reconnection pulses (Morley and Lock-\nwood, 2001). Parts (a) and (b) of Fig. 11 summarise the loca-\ntion of DMSP-F12 relative to the ESR showing, respectively,\nthe invariant latitude and the MLT of both for the cusp inter-\nsection. Figure 11c gives the cutoff velocity of the precip-\nitating magnetosheath ions, V , defined from the differential\nenergy flux contour of 108 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 s\u22121 (separating yellow\nand green in the spectrograms shown in Fig. 4). The events\ndefined in the incoming magnetosheath ions, separated by\nsteps and\/or gaps are labelled I1, I2, I3, I4 and I5 and the\nevent seen in the departing BPS electrons is labelled E.\nThe satellite entered event I1 at 09:05:10 UT, when\nDMSP-F12 was at 3 = 75.85\u25e6 and an MLT of 13:46 hrs.\nThis is (to within the ESR data resolution) at the same time\nthat the ESR entered event 10, but at a slightly higher lati-\ntude than the ESR (which was at 3 = 75.1\u25e6). However, the\nESR was at an MLT 1.82 hours smaller than that of the satel-\nlite, and a small angle of the event boundary with respect\nto the L-shells (of \u03b431 of 0.41\u25e6 per 1 hr of MLT), would\nmean that DMSP-F12 and the ESR entered the same event\nat about the same time, provided that the event is at least\nabout 2 hrs of MLT in longitudinal extent. Upon entering\nthe event, DMSP-F12 saw the onset of much more enhanced\n(and highly structured) fluxes of magnetosheath electrons;\nthese persisted until the satellite moved through the equator-\nward edge of ion event I4. This happened at 09:06:39, when\nDMSP-F12 was at 3 = 74.28\u25e6 and an MLT of 12:29 hrs\n(only 0.52 hrs greater than the MLT of the ESR). If the events\nwere L-shell aligned, this yields a combined latitudinal width\nof events I1, I2, I3 and I4 of \u03b43 = 1.57\u25e6, corresponding to\nabout 188 km at 300 km altitude. However, the satellite has\nmoved through 1.3 hrs in MLT, and thus, (1.3\u03b431) = 0.53\u25e6\nof this latitude difference can be attributed to the orientation\nof the events, giving a corrected \u03b43 of 1.04\u25e6 (corresponding\nto 126 km). Figure 7 gives a poleward phase motion of event\n10 of 300 m\/s, and at this speed, the combined events I1-I4\nwould pass over the field-aligned ESR beam in 420s and the\nESR would therefore exit from them at 09:12:00. This is ex-\nactly when event 10 ceases and thus, we can associate the\ncombined cusp ion events I1-I4 with the ESR event 10. The\nfine structure in the DMSP-F12 ion data cannot be detected in\nthe ESR data, which thus appears as one single event. How-\never, the ESR did detect a drop in electron temperature in\nthe first half of event 10 that can be associated with a drop\nin magnetosheath electron precipitation seen by DMSP-F12\nwithin event I1.\nThe small detached ion event I5 was seen at 09:07:05\nwhen DMSP-F12 was at 3 = 73.5\u25e6 and at an MLT of\n12:15 hrs. Using the poleward event phase speed of 300 m\/s\n(Fig. 7), this event would arrive at the ESR field-aligned\nbeam at 09:17:24, a predicted time which lies within the in-\nterval 09:16:00\u201309:18:00 when event 10a was observed by\nthe ESR. Thus, we can associate the ion step I5 with ESR\nevent 10a.\nThe DMSP-F12 electron data shows a rapid reconnec-\ntion pulse giving rise to the dispersed loss of energetic BPS\nelectrons in event E between 09:07:27 and 09:08:02, when\nDMSP-F12\u2019s (3, MLT) coordinates are 72.5\u25e6, 12:04 hrs\nand 71.6\u25e6, 11:28 hrs, respectively, and the ESR\u2019s are 75.1\u25e6,\n11.97 hrs and 75.1\u25e6, 11.98 hr. Thus, the satellite detected the\nedges of event E at 13 of 2.6\u25e6 and 4.5\u25e6 equatorward of the\nESR and at almost the same MLT. Figure 7 shows that event\n11 moved poleward at about 390 m\/s and, at this poleward\nphase speed, the edges of this event would have reached the\nESR after delays of 773 s and 1338 s, i.e. at 09:20:20 and\n09:30:20. Figure 6 shows that this is when event 11 was seen\nin the ESR field-aligned beam. Thus, we can firmly identify\nthe electron event E seen by DMSP-F12 with event 11 seen\nby the ESR. Thus, the data are fully consistent with the idea\nthat the Ne enhancements seen by the ESR, at least during\nthe cusp pass by DMSP-F12, correspond to the features of\nthe satellite pass that can be attributed to pulsed reconnec-\ntion.\nThe flows seen by the SuperDARN radars are enhanced\nM.

The dispersed disappearance\nof BPS electrons is labelled as event E.\npoleward of the ESR in the interval 09:09\u201309:19 (Fig. 9),\nwhereas event 10 is seen at the ESR field-aligned beam at\n09:05\u201309:12. Thus, we can also associate the flow enhance-\nment shown in Fig. 9 with event 10 seen by the ESR and with\nthe combined cusp ion events (I1-I4) seen by DMSP-F12, but\nthe inductive smoothing of the flow, relative to the reconnec-\ntion rate pulse means that its onset is delayed and its duration\nincreased. Both the onset and decay of the flow event imaged\nby SuperDARN spreads towards dusk over the ESR; this is\ndespite the fact that the relevant IMF BY is positive (Fig. 3)\nand the associated Svalgaard-Mansurov effect provides flow\nin the cusp toward dawn (Fig. 1). This supports the concept\nof a propagating active reconnection line around the after-\nnoon sector away from noon and, in this case, towards dusk,\nas discussed by Lockwood et al. (1993c), Lockwood (1994),\nMilan et al. (2000) and McWilliams et al. (2001a, b).\n4 Concluding comments\nFigure 12 (adapted from Lockwood, 1994) shows schemati-\ncally newly-opened field lines evolving away from a site X\nat which the reconnection rate is pulsed. On the left is a\nnoon-midnight cross section of the magnetosphere, viewed\nfrom dusk and with the Sun to the left. X is a low-latitude\nreconnection site (between the magnetic cusps) converting\nclosed field lines (c, such as field line 1) to open ones (o, such\nas 2\u20135) by reconnecting them with draped magnetosheath\nfield lines (i). The reconnection is shown as having pro-\nceeded in two pulses, generating the corresponding bundles\nof newly-opened flux, shown as A and B. Since A was re-\nconnected before B, it has evolved further away from the\nnose of the magnetosphere. The magnetosheath plasma con-\ncentration and temperature fall with distance from the nose\nof the magnetosphere, and thus, field lines in A will be full\nof lower fluxes of magnetosheath particles flowing along the\nfield lines across the magnetopause than will field lines in B,\nat the time shown. In addition, the faster tailward convection\nof the magnetospheric portion of flux tube A means that a\nsmaller fraction of the injected population reaches the iono-\nsphere. Thus, the fluxes of the precipitating magnetosheath\nparticles fall with elapsed time since reconnection.\nThe right-hand figure is a view looking down on the day-\nside polar cap in the northern hemisphere, with noon to the\ntop and dawn to the right. The footprints of the field lines\nshown in Fig. 12a are shown, following a convection flow\nstreamline. Cusp ion steps form between events and propa-\ngate poleward with the convection velocity. The production\nof stepped and sawtooth ion dispersion signatures by differ-\nent satellite passes through such patches has been discussed\nand modelled by Lockwood and Davis (1996) and Morley\nand Lockwood (2001). Observations of cusp ion steps reveal\nspatially contiguous patches of ion precipitation, such as pre-\ndicted in Fig. 12 for A and B. However, auroral and radar sig-\nnatures show that there are gaps between poleward-moving\nevents. As discussed earlier, the origins of these gaps is still\na matter of debate, but the data presented here imply that at\nleast some of them may be caused by variations in the mag-\nnetosheath electron precipitation within the magnetosphere.\nSince these have been detected by Cluster above the auroral\nacceleration region, this is a separate effect from the electron\n1608 M. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated observations of transient poleward-moving events\nFig. 12. (a) Schematic illustration of the dayside magnetosphere near the noon-midnight cross section of the magnetosphere, viewed from\ndusk and with the Sun to the left. X is a low-latitude reconnection site (between the magnetic cusps) converting closed field lines (c, such\nas field line 1) to open ones (o such as 2\u20135) that thread the magnetopause, the dashed line labelled MP, by reconnecting them with draped\nmagnetosheath field lines (i). A and B are patches of newly-opened field lines produced by reconnection pulses at X. (b) The view looking\ndown on the dayside polar cap in the northern hemisphere, with noon to the top and dawn to the right. The footprints of the field lines on the\nleft are shown, following a convection flow streamline. The thick line is the ionospheric footprint of the reconnection line X\nacceleration effect in regions of upward field-aligned current\n(model 3), as proposed by Davis and Lockwood (1996) and\nLockwood et al. (1993a, 2001b).\nAs discussed above, as the newly-opened flux tubes\nevolve, the fluxes of the precipitating magnetosheath parti-\ncles fall. Thus, variations in the flux and spectra of the in-\njected magnetosheath ions and electrons observed by Clus-\nter could be interpreted as variations in the elapsed time\nsince reconnection. With this being the case, when Cluster\nwas within region A, it would see lower fluxes that decayed\nfurther as the point migrated anti-sunward where the field\nlines observed thread the boundary. However, as a newer\nregion B passes over the satellite, the point where the ob-\nserved field lines thread the magnetopause jumps sunward\nand the satellite sees a sudden rise in fluxes and temperature.\nThese then decrease again slowly, as for the prior event as\nit evolves anti-sunward. Thus, the variations seen by Clus-\nter could be explained in terms of variations of the elapsed\ntime since reconnection of the field lines sampled. This in-\nterpretation is essentially the same as that successfully ap-\nplied to an FTE signature at the magnetopause (Lockwood\nand Hapgood, 1998), to the cusp ion structure at middle and\nlow-altitudes (respectively, Lockwood et al., 1998 and Lock-\nwood and Davis, 1996) and to the ESR concentration and\ntemperature variations (Davis and Lockwood, 1996).\nHowever, the combination of Cluster and ground-based\ndata presented here suggests that this is not the explanation\nof these Cluster data, or perhaps only a partial explanation.\nIf the association of the electron flux enhancements seen by\nCluster with the ESR patches is real, then the former should\nconvect poleward into the tail lobe, mirroring the evolution of\nthe ionospheric patches as they migrate poleward into the po-\nlar cap. In other words, they should maintain their relatively\nenhanced magnetosheath electron precipitation at all times\nas they move into the tail lobe. This means that the enhance-\nments are not just reflecting variations in elapsed time recon-\nnection and a significant additional mechanism is at work.\nFigure 10 suggests that at the centre of patches, the plasma\nconcentration in the F-region and in the topside ionosphere\nis enhanced by increased flux of the lowest energy magne-\ntosheath electrons. If this is due to a lowering of a potential\nbarrier at the magnetopause, then this feature must persist\non certain field lines, but be absent at all times on others.\nOne possibility is that the amplitude of the potential bar-\nrier presented to magnetosheath electrons is decreased where\nthe magnitude of the boundary-normal magnetic field is in-\ncreased. This would mean that patches of the enhanced boun-\ndary-normal field (produced by pulses of enhanced reconnec-\nM. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated observations of transient poleward-moving events 1609\ntion rate) would effectively be \u201choles\u201d in the magnetopause\nthat would allow lower energy magnetosheath electrons to\nenter the magnetosphere. Since these field lines maintain\ntheir enhanced boundary-normal field as they evolve into the\ntail lobe, the enhanced low-energy electron fluxes would then\npersist as the field lines evolve into the polar cap with in-\ncreasing elapsed time since reconnection, giving a poleward-\nmoving polar cap patch in the ionosphere.\nWe note that the association between the polar cap patches\n(seen by the ESR) and the plasma concentration enhance-\nments (seen by Cluster) can only be made tentatively in this\ncase. The problem is that the conjunction between the Clus-\nter footprint and the ESR, at least as predicted by the mag-\nnetic field model, is not close. This means that changes in\nthe speed and direction of convection result in large varia-\ntions in the lag between the ESR and Cluster data. We in-\ntend to search for further examples in combined Cluster-ESR\ndata, with closer conjunction of the two when located within\nthe dayside polar cap. We also would like to find examples\nin which the convection flow pattern remains relatively con-\nstant, enabling us to distinguish the effects of modulations\nto the magnetosheath electron precipitation from the conse-\nquences of transient convection changes through flux tube\nevolution and enhanced loss rates.\nAcknowledgements.
