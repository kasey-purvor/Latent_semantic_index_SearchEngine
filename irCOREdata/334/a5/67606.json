The solar proton event of October 1989 and es-\npecially the sunset of 23 October is examined in this study\nof negative ion chemistry, which combines measurements of\nnitric oxide, electron density, and cosmic radio noise absorp-\ntion with ion and neutral chemistry modelling. Model re-\nsults show that the negative charge transition from electrons\nto negative ions during sunset occurs at altitudes below 80 km\nand is dependent on both ultraviolet and visible solar radia-\ntion. The ultraviolet effect is mostly due to rapid changes\nin atomic oxygen and O2(11g), while the decrease in NO\u22123\nphotodetachment plays a minor role. The effect driven by\nvisible wavelengths is due to changes in photodissociation\nof CO\u22123 and the subsequent electron photodetachment from\nO\u2212, and at higher altitudes is also due to a decrease in the\nphotodetachment of O\u22122 . The relative sizes of the ultravi-\nolet and visible effects vary with altitude, with the visible\neffects increasing in importance at higher altitudes, and they\nare also controlled by the nitric oxide concentration. These\nmodelling results are in good agreement with EISCAT inco-\nherent scatter radar and Kilpisja\u00a8rvi riometer measurements.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Ion chemistry and composition;\nIonosphere-atmosphere interactions; Particle precipitation)\n1 Introduction\nNegative ions are a feature of the D-region ionosphere, where\nthey hold a substantial portion of the negative charge. Neg-\native ion chemistry is initiated by electron attachment to\nmolecular oxygen\nO2 + e+M \u2192 O\u22122 +M (1)\nafter which subsequent reactions form other ions, includ-\ning complex clusters (see, e.g. Hargreaves, 1992, 231\u2013233).\nBased on laboratory work and in-situ measurements, the\nmain negative ions are expected to be CO\u22123 and NO\n\u2212\n3 , and\nCorrespondence to: P. T. Verronen\n(pekka.verronen@fmi.fi)\ntheir hydrates. The main reaction path leading from the ini-\ntial O\u22122 to these \u201cterminal\u201d ions involves neutral ozone, car-\nbon dioxide, and nitric oxide, and the formation of interme-\ndiate ion O\u22123 (Reid, 1987). Negative ions are present at al-\ntitudes below 80 km, where the atmospheric density is high\nenough so that the 3-body reaction of Eq. (1) is efficient. The\nbalance with electrons is then determined by electron detach-\nment reactions, such as\nO\u22122 + O \u2192 O3 + e. (2)\nMost of the balancing reactions depend on the solar light,\nsuch that at night the electrons nearly disappear from alti-\ntudes below 80 km and negative charge is held largely by the\nions. During sunset, there is a transition of negative charge\nfrom electrons to negative ions, and a reverse transition oc-\ncurs during sunrise. Any realistic modelling of the D-region\nionosphere requires consideration of negative ion chemistry.\nThe transition of negative charge is driven by solar light.\nOf those ions that are neutralised by photons, only NO\u22123 has\nsuch a high electron affinity that ultraviolet (UV) radiation is\nrequired (Collis and Rietveld, 1990, and references therein).\nOther ions, such as CO\u22123 , are also affected by electromag-\nnetic radiation at visible (VIS) wavelengths. Furthermore,\nindirect solar effects, driven by UV radiation, are also present\nduring transitions, because changes in atomic oxygen and\nO2(11g) affect reactions like the one given in Eq. (2). A\ntransition should therefore display dependence on both UV\nand VIS light but the relative magnitudes of these effects are\nexpected to vary with altitude and are also controlled by ni-\ntric oxide (NO) concentration, which determines the balance\nbetween the main ions NO\u22123 and CO\n\u2212\n3 (Reid, 1987). The re-\nmaining uncertainties in the photochemistry of negative ions\nand the high variability of NO in the auroral regions make\nmodelling of this transition quite challenging, especially be-\ncause in-situ measurements of negative ion concentrations\nare rare.\nThe October 1989 Solar Proton Event (SPE) is one of the\nlargest SPEs ever observed. During an SPE, high-energy pro-\ntons precipitate into the atmosphere, down to mesospheric\nand stratospheric altitudes, causing both ionospheric and\nneutral atmospheric changes (see, e.g. Verronen et al., 2005,\n188 P. T. Verronen et al.: Negative charge transition in the D-region during sunset\nand references therein for more information on neutral atmo-\nspheric effects). Ionization due to SPEs typically has a max-\nimum around the stratopause region (ionospheric C-region),\nwhere the quiet-time ionization due to galactic cosmic rays is\nrelatively weak, and covers the magnetic polar cap area more\nor less uniformly. Earlier work on the October 1989 SPE has\naddressed both the ionospheric and atmospheric effects. Ri-\netveld and Collis (1993) have studied ionospheric character-\nistics using Incoherent Scatter (IS) radar spectral measure-\nments, while Reid et al. (1991) and Jackman et al. (1995)\nhave investigated the production of NOx (odd nitrogen) and\nsubsequent loss of ozone.\nThe sunrise\/sunset transition effects during this particular\nSPE have been studied by Collis and Rietveld (1990) and del\nPozo et al. (1999). Based on electron density measurements\nby IS radar, Collis and Rietveld (1990) concluded that at sun-\nrise the electron release from negative ions is due to UV pho-\ntodetachment. del Pozo et al. (1999) studied the rapid change\nin IS radar spectral width during sunset and underlined the\nimportance of atomic oxygen in the negative charge balance.\nOn the basis of these studies, it seems that both the changes\nin solar illumination, as well as the changes in neutral atmo-\nspheric constituents must be taken into account when mod-\nelling twilight transitions. Typically, ion chemistry models\ntake the neutral atmosphere as a static background and are\ntherefore not well suited for transition studies.\nIn this paper, we study the sunset transition of 23 October\n1989 at a high-latitude location during a solar proton event.\nOur tool, a coupled ion and neutral chemistry model, has\nbeen updated for transition studies and is used to interpret\nelectron density, cosmic radio noise absorption, and nitric\noxide measurements. We will show that the model, taking\ninto account the changes in the neutral atmosphere, as well\nas the changes in the electron photodetachment processes, is\nable to represent the sunset transition with reasonable suc-\ncess, in agreement with the measurements. The model re-\nsults are used to discuss the relative importance of different\nprocesses contributing to the transition.\n2 Sodankyla\u00a8 Ion Chemistry model\nThe Sodankyla\u00a8 Ion Chemistry model (SIC) is a 1-D chemical\nmodel designed for ionospheric D-region studies. The model\nwas applied first by Burns et al. (1991) in a study of EISCAT\nradar data, and thereafter by, for example, Turunen (1993),\nRietveld et al. (1996), Ulich et al. (2000), Verronen et al.\n(2002), and Clilverd et al. (2005). A detailed description of\nthe original SIC model, in which only ion chemistry was con-\nsidered, can be found in Turunen et al. (1996). The latest\nversion solves time-dependent concentrations of 63 ions, in-\ncluding 29 negative ions, as well as 13 neutral species (O(3P),\nO(1D), O3, N(4S), N(2D), NO, NO2, NO3, HNO3, N2O5,\nH, OH, and HO2) between the altitudes of 20 and 150 km,\nwith a 1-km resolution, taking into account several hundred\nchemical reactions and external forcing due to solar radiation\n(1\u2212422 nm), electron and proton precipitation, and galactic\ncosmic rays. The model includes molecular and eddy diffu-\nsion in the vertical direction. For a recent detailed descrip-\ntion of the model, see Verronen et al. (2005) and references\ntherein. Figure 1 presents a diagram of the negative ion re-\naction paths considered in the SIC model. Note, however,\nthat photodetachment and photodissociation reactions are not\nshown in the diagram.\nFor this study, two new neutrals were added as unknowns:\nO2(11g) and H2O2. Both of these have strong diurnal vari-\nation in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere. The chem-\nical scheme was updated accordingly. O2(11g) is produced\nby photodissociation of ozone and is then deactivated in a\nreaction with molecular oxygen or by quenching (see, e.g.\nBrasseur and Solomon, 1986). The reaction rate coefficients\nfor the loss reactions were taken from Sander et al. (2003)\nand Thomas et al. (1983), respectively. Note that the ionic\nreactions of O2(11g) were already included in the model and\nare given by Turunen et al. (1996). For H2O2, we added the\nloss by photodissociation using cross sections from Sander\net al. (2003). The other reactions important to H2O2 were\nalready included in the model.\n2.1 Modelling of the sunset of 23 October 1989\nThe modelling started with an initialisation of the model, i.e.\nthe same day (mid-October conditions) was modelled over\nand over again until a repeatable diurnal cycle was reached.\nThis initialisation then provided the starting concentrations\nfor the SPE modelling, which was run from 18 October,\n00:00 UT (about 37 h before the initial onset of the SPE) until\n23 October, 24:00 UT. Ionization rates due to proton precipi-\ntation were calculated using proton flux measurements of the\nGOES-7 satellite as input, in the manner described by Ver-\nronen et al. (2005). For the present study, the location of all\nmodelling is that of the EISCAT VHF radar in Troms\u00f8, Nor-\nway (69.59\u25e6 N, 19.23\u25e6 E). The model was run for a restricted\naltitude range of 20\u2013120 km instead of taking the default up-\nper limit at 150 km, and the results were saved with a 5-min\ntime resolution.\nThe SPE started in the afternoon (UT) of 19 October\n1989. Measured fluxes of high-energy protons peaked dur-\ning the next day, with the E>30 MeV proton flux reach-\ning values higher than 108 m\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121, which means an in-\ncrease by 5 orders of magnitude above the quiet-time values.\nSubsequent peaks occurred on 23 and 25 October, with the\n>30 MeV proton flux values exceeding 107 m\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121. At\nthe D-region altitudes, the calculated ionization rates from\nthe onset of the event until the end of 23 October varied be-\ntween 108 and 1010 m\u22123 s\u22121. Thus, the ionization due to the\nSPE clearly exceeded the quiet-time ionization sources (see,\ne.g Hargreaves, 1992, p. 230). In the model, we have ne-\nglected the ionization by hard X-rays (0.1\u20130.8 nm), a highly\nvariable source which can significantly contribute to the D-\nregion ionization. However, during a strong SPE it is rea-\nsonable to assume that the ionization is dominated by the\nprecipitating protons.\nP. T.

The arrows are labelled with the neutral constituents taking part in the reactions. Note\nthat photodetachment and photodissociation reactions are not shown.\nWe are especially interested in the sunset of 23 October\nbecause of the EISCAT measurements made between 12:00\nand 18:00 UT in a special lower D-region mode. However,\nit is important to model the whole history of the event be-\nfore the radar experiment, because changes in the neutral at-\nmosphere caused by the SPE, which can be cumulative and\nlong-lasting, are likely to be important to the sunset transition\ncharacteristics. Odd nitrogen (NOx=N+NO+NO2) is pro-\nduced in significant amounts through dissociation of molec-\nular nitrogen via particle impact and ion chemistry (Rusch\net al., 1981). Also odd hydrogen (HOx=H+HO+HO2) is pro-\nduced, through hydrate ion chemistry following the ioniza-\ntion (Solomon et al., 1981). As already mentioned, NO plays\nand important part in determination of the ion balance. In\naddition, enhancements in NOx and HOx subsequently lead\nto an ozone decrease through catalytic reactions (see, e.g.\nBrasseur and Solomon, 1986, p. 291\u2013299). While NOx is\nexpected to affect ozone in the upper stratosphere, an HOx\nincrease will lead to an ozone depletion at D-region alti-\ntudes. Ozone changes have an effect, e.g., on the produc-\ntion of O\u22123 , which is an important intermediate ion for the\n\u201cterminal\u201d ions CO\u22123 and NO\n\u2212\n3 . The twilight transition of\nnegative charge will also be affected, because ozone is in a\nphotochemical balance with atomic oxygen and is the source\nof O2(11g), both of which are involved in electron detach-\nment reactions. Further, the ozone depletion is expected to\nbe strongest during sunrise and sunset times (Verronen et al.,\n2005). With our combined ion and neutral chemistry model,\nwe are able to account for the neutral atmospheric changes\ncaused by the SPE.\nDuring the sunset of 23 October, the proton fluxes\nstayed relatively constant, although at a highly elevated\nlevel when contrasted with quiet-time levels. At altitudes\nabove 65 km the calculated ionization rates, based on GOES\n190 P. T.

Therefore, the sunset transition under\nstudy was not significantly disturbed by sudden changes in\nthe proton forcing.\nIn the SIC model, photodetachment is considered for O\u2212,\nO\u22122 , O\n\u2212\n3 , OH\n\u2212\n, CO\u22123 , NO\n\u2212\n2 , and NO\n\u2212\n3 and photodissocia-\ntion for O\u22123 , O\n\u2212\n4 , CO\n\u2212\n3 , CO\n\u2212\n3 (H2O), and CO\u22124 . The pho-\ntodissociation of CO\u22123 (and CO\u22123 (H2O)) is important for twi-\nlight transitions because it releases O\u2212, which then, in turn,\nrapidly releases an electron (Peterson, 1976). In addition to\nphoton-driven reactions, there are a number of two-body re-\nactions which release an electron, involving O\u2212, O\u22122 , O\n\u2212\n3 ,\nOH\u2212, and Cl\u2212. These reactions and their rate coefficients\nare given by Turunen et al. (1996), except the photodissoci-\nation of CO\u22123 (H2O) which comes from Peterson (1976). For\nthe photodetachment and photodissociation reactions the rate\ncoefficients are given in \u201cfull-light\u201d conditions; in the model\nwe scale them based on the illumination level, in a manner\nsimilar to del Pozo et al. (1999). The scaled coefficient ks is\ncalculated from the \u201cfull-light\u201d coefficient k as\nks = F\nF0\nk, (3)\nwhere F is the wavelength-integrated solar flux at a certain\naltitude at a certain time. F0 is a reference flux pre-calculated\nfor the same altitude but for solar zenith angle of 45\u25e6. For\nNO\u22123 photodetachment the fluxes are integrated from 99 to\n318 nm (Reid, 1987), while for photodetachment and pho-\ntodissociation of other ions the integration is done from 99\nto 422 nm. Figure 2 shows the calculated UV-dependent\n(<318 nm) and VIS-dependent (<422 nm) scaling factors\n( F\nF0\n), as well as the solar zenith angles for the sunset of\n23 October. The UV and VIS wavelengths are attenuated\ndifferently, especially at high solar zenith angles. UV attenu-\nation is strong and during sunset UV fluxes gradually reduce\nto zero well before the ray interception by the solid Earth oc-\ncurs. In contrast, VIS radiation is only partially attenuated\nbefore the interception, when it is practically \u201cswitched off\u201d.\nSolar flux values at each altitude are determined us-\ning the well-known Beer-Lambert absorption law, with the\ndaily above-atmosphere fluxes provided by the SOLAR2000\nmodel, version 2.23 (Tobiska et al., 2000). Calculation of op-\ntical depth is required, and for high zenith angles it is neces-\nsary to take into account the spherical geometry of the atmo-\nsphere. In our model, the optical depth calculation follows a\nprocedure described by Rees (1989, p. 12\u201313). Note that in\nthe calculations we do not take into account refraction, the\neffect of which is negligible for all ray paths, except maybe\nthose with a tangent point very close to the Earth\u2019s surface\n(Reid, 1987). The main absorbing gases are molecular oxy-\ngen and ozone. The MSISE90 model provides O2 concentra-\ntion profiles down to the ground level (Hedin, 1991), while\nfor O3 we use the model results, so that the optical depth cal-\nculation takes into account the changes in ozone due to the\nP.

Modelled variation of (a) ozone and (b) nitric oxide concentrations during the sunset of 23 October 1989.\nproton precipitation, as well as the normal diurnal variation\nwhich is substantial in the upper stratosphere and above (see\nFig. 3a). However, ozone values below the lower altitude\nlimit of the model at 20 km are also needed because for so-\nlar zenith angles larger than 90\u25e6 the ray path passes through\nthese lower altitudes. In the model we use values from Shi-\nmazaki (1984) and Brasseur and Solomon (1986) for these\naltitudes, assuming a fixed ozone profile throughout the mod-\nelling. This assumption is reasonable because 1) at altitudes\nbelow about 40 km there is no diurnal variation of ozone and\n2) even for large SPEs the effects are typically not significant\nbelow \u223c30 km.\n3 Measurements\n3.1 Electron density from EISCAT VHF incoherent scatter\nradar\nIncoherent scatter radars can provide altitude profiles of\nionospheric quantities, such as electron density. The tech-\nnique includes transmitting a power pulse, which is then scat-\ntered in the ionosphere, so that the returned power can be\nmeasured. Several experiment odes were used during the\nSPEs of 1989; these are described in, for example, Collis and\nRietveld (1990).\nOn 23 October the VHF radar was operated in the spe-\ncial D-region mode \u201cGEN-11\u201d (Turunen, 1986). The an-\ntenna was tilted 45\u25e6 towards north, so that the lower alti-\ntude limit within the radar range was further lowered from\n70 km to 50 km. However, due to instrumental limitations the\ntrue lower limit of measurements was 54 km (Collis and Ri-\netveld, 1990). The quiet-time electron densities in the lower\nD-region, below 70 km, are of the order of 107\u2013108 m\u22123 (see,\ne.g. Hargreaves, 1992, p. 231). For these kinds of small val-\nues the EISCAT signal-to-noise ratio is too low for measure-\nments to be practical (Turunen, 1993). However, in this case\nthe SPE-elevated ionization levels allowed for observations\nreaching stratopause altitudes.\nThe radar in Troms\u00f8, Norway (69.59\u25e6 N, 19.23\u25e6 E) was\noperated from 12:00 UT until 18:00 UT, measuring the\nsunset conditions in the D-region. The altitude resolution\nof the measurements was \u22480.75 km for the tilted antenna\n(\u22481.05 km for a vertical) and the basic time resolution was\n10 s. Before the analysis, the data were post-integrated over\n5 minutes and interpolated to 1-km grid. The error of the\npost-integrated data depends on the received power, i.e. for\nlower electron densities the uncertainty is larger, but is typi-\ncally better than 10% (Collis and Rietveld, 1990).\n3.2 Cosmic radio noise absorption from Kilpisja\u00a8rvi riome-\nter\nRiometers measure ionospheric absorption of cosmic radio\nnoise, typically at frequencies of 20\u201360 MHz. Cosmic radio\nnoise is of galactic origin and is considered to be constant\nover l ng periods of time, so that any chang s in the signal\nobserved on the ground are due to changes in ionospheric\nabsorption. The absorption depends upon electron-neutral\ncollision frequency, which, in turn, depends upon electron\ndensity and temperature. Typically, most of the absorption\noccurs in D-region altitudes, i.e. below 90 km. Riometers\nare relatively cheap, easy to operate, and can continuously\nmeasure the integrated ionization levels of the overhead iono-\nsphere. Interpretation of measurements includes determina-\ntion of a quiet-day curve (QDC), which is then subtracted\n192 P. T.

For a description of riometer\ntechniques and measurements, see, e.g. Ranta et al. (1983).\nIn this study we have used measurements of the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\nriometer (69.05\u25e6 N, 20.78\u25e6 E, f =30 MHz), located in north-\nern Finland, about 85 km east of the location of the EISCAT\nradar.\n3.3 Nitric oxide from a Southern Hemispheric rocket flight\nThere is not much information available on polar nitric oxide\nduring the October 1989 SPE. The only measurements we\nare aware of are those by Zadorozhny et al. (1994), who flew\na M-100B meteorological rocket on 23 October, at 05:00 UT,\nin the Southern Hemisphere at 55.62\u25e6S, 50.18\u25e6 E. The time\nof the measurement is well suited for comparison with our\nmodelling, because it is more than two days after the peak\nforcing by protons and only 7 h before the beginning of the\nEISCAT electron density measurements. On the other hand,\nthe illumination conditions are quite different from those of\nour modelling location in the Northern Hemisphere. The so-\nlar zenith angle for the time and location of the rocket flight is\nabout 55\u25e6 while at the modelling location the smallest zenith\nangle is about 81\u25e6 at 10:25 UT. Although NOx has a rel-\natively long photochemical lifetime, there is a strong diur-\nnal variation between NO and NO2 in the lower mesosphere\nand stratosphere. During daytime a photochemical equilib-\nrium exists but at night most of NO is converted to NO2\nthrough a reaction with O3 (see Fig. 3b). For this reason,\nwe choose the modelled 10:25 UT NO profile to be com-\npared with the rocket measurement. In addition to different\nillumination conditions, meteorological conditions are differ-\nent in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern. In the\nsouth, the polar vortex is breaking up, while in the north it is\nforming. This might lead to important differences in NO be-\ncause of the possible accumulation of NO inside the southern\nvortex during the preceding winter months, due to absence\nof photodissociation and vertical transport (see, e.g. Siskind\net al., 1997). Nevertheless, we pursue the comparison be-\ncause the high production of NOx, due to the SPE, is likely\nto have a significant impact on the NO levels at the D-region\naltitudes. An indication of this is given by another, pre-SPE\nrocket measurent by Zadorozhny et al. (1994) on 12 Octo-\nber (57.08\u25e6S, 45.04\u25e6 E), which clearly shows lower values\nof NO than the observation during the SPE on 23 October,\nespecially in the lower mesosphere and upper stratosphere.\nIn Sect. 4.1 we will show that the observed and modelled,\nduring-SPE altitude profiles have a very similar shape, which\nis another indication of the dominant role of SPE-produced\nNO.\nIn the stratosphere and lower mesosphere the photochem-\nical lifetime of NOx, which is determined by photodissocia-\ntion of NO, is relatively long compared to the duration of the\nSPE (Zadorozhny et al., 1994). Therefore, most of the NOx\nproduced during the SPE is still present on 23 October. In\nthe upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere, the lifetime\nof NOx is of the order of 1 day in solar illuminated conditions\n(Barth et al., 2001), so that a part of the SPE-produced NOx\nwill have been destroyed before the rocket measurement was\nmade. In summary, the measured and modelled NO profiles\nshould be most comparable in the lower mesosphere, while at\nhigher altitudes the different illumination conditions between\nthe two locations may have significantly different influences\non the NOx produced during the SPE.\nP.

The dash-dot line shows the model result for 23 October when\napplying a higher production of NO by secondary electrons.\nModelling results by Jackman et al. (1995) indicate that\nthe absolute increase of NOy (=N+NO+NO2 in the meso-\nsphere) during the October 1989 SPE was essentially the\nsame in both hemispheres. However, because our modelling\nlocation and the location of the rocket flight have markedly\ndifferent magnetic latitudes, they should experience different\nproton forcing due to differences in magnetic rigidity cutoff,\nwhich determines the minimum energy required for a proton\nto reach a certain geographic location (see, e.g. Hargreaves,\n1992, p. 355). To check if this was the case, we calculated\nthe rigidity cutoff energies a the two locations for the du-\nration of the SPE using a method which depends upon the\nmeasured Kp magnetic index (see Rodger et al., 2006, for a\ndescription of the method). Our modelling location is well\nwithin the magnetic polar cap so that there is effectively no\ncutoff at any time. At the location of the rocket flight, which\nis near the edge of the magnetic polar cap, the cutoff ener-\ngies, shown in the upper panel of Fig. 4, are high for most of\nthe event and display large variations. However, it turns out\nthat the high cutoffs have a relatively small effect on the total\nNO production in this case (see Sect. 4.1 for a discussion).\n4 Results and discussion\n4.1 Nitric oxide\nFigure 5 compares the modelled and rocket-measured NO\nprofiles, which are very similar in shape. The maximum of\nNO is at 45\u201360 km, a minimum is at 70\u201380 km, and above\n80 km the concentration again increases. The modelled con-\ncentrations are within the error margins of the measure-\nments at all altitudes and the agreement between the mea-\nsured and modelled NO values is very good at the altitudes\nstudied by riometers and EISCAT radar, i.e. between 60 and\n80 km. However, the difference in concentration is quite sub-\nstantial around 50 km, where the measured amount of NO\n(\u22482\u00d71015 m\u22123) is four times higher than the modelled value\n(\u22485\u00d71014 m\u22123). We discuss the possible reasons for this\ndifference below.\nThe main part of the energy input and NO production by\nprotons occurs between 40 and 80 km, where the modelling\nresult for NO is independent of its initial amount (assum-\ning that the initial values before the SPE are lower than those\nmeasured after the onset of the SPE). Therefore, if we assume\nthat there is no additional production of NO, the reason for\nthe lower model values might be in the assumptions behind\nthe SIC-modelled production of NO by protons. It should\nbe noted that above 80 km, where the proton forcing has a\nsmaller effect, a better agreement with the measurements was\nobtained by using a downward NO flux of 4\u00d71013 m\u22122 s\u22121\nat the upper boundary of the model (120 km) during both ini-\ntialisation and modelling.\nAssuming that the majority of the NO produced by the\nSPE was not destroyed before 23 October, Zadorozhny et al.\n(1994) estimated the concentration of NO at 50-km altitude\nfrom\n[NO] = C\n\u222b\nPi dt, (4)\nwhere Pi is the calculated ionization rate and C is a con-\nstant varying between 1.2 and 1.6 (see, e.g. Porter et al.,\n1976; Rusch et al., 1981). Integrating from the beginning of\nthe SPE until the rocket flight time, they calculated [NO] to\n194 P. T.

Using the same approach for our mod-\nelling results, we calculated [NO] to be 6.7\u22129.3\u00d71014 m\u22123,\nwhich is about 35% lower, partly due to different neutral at-\nmospheres and ionization rate calculation routines used. The\nproton energy required for reaching 50-km altitude is about\n30 MeV. Integrating the NO production only at times when\nthe cutoff energy (shown in the upper panel of Fig. 4) is\nsmaller than 30 MeV results in about a 20% reduction in\nthe final concentration at 05:00 UT. The applied cutoff has\na moderate effect because, as shown in the bottom panel of\nFig. 4, most of the NO production occurs on 20 October,\nwhen the proton flux was highest and the cutoff was at its\nlowest. Therefore, in the lower mesosphere the total NO pro-\nduction by the SPE on the modelling location should be com-\nparable to that at the rocket flight location.\nThe SIC equivalent of C (in Eq. 4) can be estimated from\nthe model results by considering the different pathways lead-\ning from ionization to NOx production through dissociation\nof N2 by protons and secondary electrons, as well as a num-\nber ion chemical reactions. By dividing the NOx production\nrate by the ionization rate, the constant C is found to be about\n1.15 at 50 km, i.e. in the lower limit of its theoretical range.\nAn adjustable parameter in the model is the production of\natomic nitrogen by secondary electrons, which is set to 0.8\ntimes the ionization rate, equal to the lower limit given by\nRusch et al. (1981). Figure 5 shows that by using the up-\nper limit of this parameter, 1.21 (i.e. C\u22481.56), the resulting\namount of NO at 50 km is about 7\u00d71014 m\u22123, which is still\nalmost three times lower than the measured value.\nIonization leads to atomic nitrogen production first, and\nhere the branching between N(2D) and N(4S) states is im-\nportant because the former produces NO while the latter de-\nstroys it (Brasseur and Solomon, 1986, p. 267). Zipf et al.\n(1980) have reported this branching to be close to 0.54,\nfavouring N(2D), but there is some uncertainty and this ra-\ntio is commonly used as a fitting parameter in models. In\nour model we use a value of 0.6. As a sensitivity test, we\nincreased the ratio to 0.75 and repeated the whole SPE mod-\nelling. The results (not shown) indicate that at 50 km the\namount of NO is quite insensitive to the change while at 65\u2013\n80 km the NO values clearly exceeded the measured ones.\nZadorozhny et al. (1994) mention production by relativis-\ntic electron precipitation as a possible reason for the high\namounts of NO measured at 50 km. Since the uncertainties\nin the modelled SPE-driven production of NO are not able\nto fully explain the difference between modelling and the\nrocket measurements, an additional production source seems\nquite probable, especially if taking into account that the NOx\n(=NO+NO2) production of the SIC model has been validated\nduring another SPE by the GOMOS instrument aboard the\nEnvisat satellite (Verronen et al., 2005).\n4.2 Negative ion concentrations\nIn D-region research, it is usual to show the negative ion to\nelectron ratio, \u03bb. A graph of this parameter, based on the\nmodel results, is presented as a function of time and altitude\nin Fig. 6 for the sunset hours of 23 October. It clearly demon-\nstrates the transition of negative charge from ions to electrons\nduring the sunset. Before the sunset, the transition altitude,\nwhere negative ion and electron concentrations are equal, is\nat \u224867 km, while after the sunset it is at \u224878 km.\nP. T.

Also photodissociation of CO\u22123 decreases, at\na later time, and its concentration increases at altitudes above\n60 km. O\u22122 decreases at altitudes below 70 km, while NO\n\u2212\n3\nand CO\u22123 , for which the main loss processes are the detach-\nment\/dissociation reactions, hold a larger and larger portion\nof the negative charge as the sunset advances. After sunset,\nwhen a nighttime balance is reached, NO\u22123 is clearly the main\nion.\n4.3 Cosmic radio noise absorption\nEach run of the SIC model is based on a neutral background\natmosphere given by the MSISE90 model and provides con-\ncentration profiles of neutral and ionic species. Cosmic radio\nnoise absorption can be estimated from the modelling results\nby following Banks and Kockarts (1973, Part A, p. 194) and\ncalculating the electron collision frequencies of N2, O2, and\nHe from MSIS and of O and H from SIC, using the neu-\ntral temperature profile of MSIS, which we can assume to\nbe equal to the electron temperature below 100 km. Elec-\ntron density is obtained from SIC by subtracting the sum\nof negative ion concentrations from the sum of positive ion\nP. T. Verronen et al.: Negative charge transition in the D-region during sunset 197\nconcentrations. Finally, we use the method of Sen and Wyller\n(1960) to compute differential absorption dL\/dh and inte-\ngrate with respect to height. This method takes the opera-\ntional frequency of the riometer and assumes a dipole ap-\nproximation for the geomagnetic field to obtain an electron\ngyrofrequency at the respective altitude and latitude.\nFigure 8 shows the calculated absorption for 23 October\ncompared to that measured by the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi 30-MHz ri-\nometer (located 85 km East of the modelling location), both\nof which show two distinct levels, 1\u20133 dB at night and 7\u2013\n10 dB during day. The daytime behaviours, from 07:00 to\n14:00 UT (10:25 UT corresponds to local time noon), be-\ntween the modelled and observed absorptions, differ signifi-\ncantly. The riometer shows a gradual increase between sun-\nrise until the beginning of sunset, while calculated values\nfollow the proton forcing, peaking at 07:00\u201309:00 UT and\nthen gradually decrease until reaching a lower level at about\n13:00 UT. The calculated absorption values are clearly lower\nthan those measured at daytime (after 10:00 UT), as well as\nduring and after the sunset. However, the sunset behaviour\nis well modelled, in time scale as well as in steepness of the\ntransition.\nAt nighttime, when the D-region electron density is low,\nthe contribution of upper altitudes can be important to total\nabsorption, especially if auroral precipitation occurs. From\nEISCAT measurements (CP2 mode, from 18:00 UT onwards,\nnot shown) it is evident that there was auroral electron pre-\ncipitation after sunset, resulting in significantly higher elec-\ntron density values at altitudes above 90 km compared to\nour modelling. By replacing the modelled densities with\nthe measured ones and then repeating the absorption calcula-\ntion from 18:00 to 24:00 UT, the resulting absorptions were\nclearly closer to those measured by the riometer. Therefore,\na part of the after-sunset difference between the measured\nand modelled absorption can be explained by auroral elec-\ntron precipitation. At daytime, the majority of the absorption\ncomes from the D-region altitudes, such that typical auroral\nelectron precipitation, if present, could explain only a small\nportion of the difference. However, in the following sections\nwe will show that high-energy electron precipitation is a pos-\nsible cause for the daytime differences.\n4.4 Electron densities\nFor comparison, the modelled electron densities were con-\nverted to raw electron densities N rawe . The backscattered\npower of EISCAT radar is a direct measure of N rawe , which,\non the other hand, is a function of the electron density and\nthe total concentration of negative ions (see, e.g. del Pozo\net al., 1999, and references therein for more details on the\nconversion).\nElectron density profiles for selected times during the sun-\nset are shown in Fig. 9. The shapes of the measured profiles\nvary significantly during sunset at altitudes below 80 km.\nThese variations are well represented by the model.

Most significant differences, which\nare clearly larger than the 10% margin, are in the 15:00 UT\nand 15:20 UT profiles at altitudes above 65 km. Since the\nnegative charge transition during the sunset should result in\ndecreasing rather than increasing electron density, a possi-\nble reason for the observed higher densities is an additional\nionization source.\nConsidering the temporal behaviour, Fig. 10 shows the\nsunset electron densities for altitudes of 65, 72, and 80 km.\nAt 80 km there is no clear transition in either the measure-\nments or in the modelling. This is expected because the\nelectrons are dominant over negative ions at this altitude.\nThe modelled density decreases after sunset, partly due to\nthe gradual decrease in proton forcing, while the measured\ndensity stays more or less at the same level. At lower alti-\ntudes there are clear transitions, which begin at about 15:30\nand 14:30 UT, at 72 and 65 km, respectively. At 65 km, the\nchange is gradual until 16:00 UT, when there is a \u201cdrop off\u201d,\ni.e. a sudden decrease of electron density between 15:55 and\n16:00 UT, corresponding to the Earth\u2019s shadow covering this\naltitude. This drop off is also seen in the data, although not\nas pronounced. The initial gradual change and drop-off end\nconstitute a two-step process, similar to what has been ob-\nserved in sunrise conditions (Collis and Rietveld, 1990). This\nindicates that the transition is dependent on both the UV and\nVIS solar radiation. At 72 km, the transition is steeper than\nat 65 km. The drop off occurs 5 min later than at 65 km and is\nnot visible in the data, although such a step could be hidden\nby the 10% uncertainty. The measured values show a con-\ntinuing transition until 16:30 UT, a feature that is within the\nuncertainty limits and is not confirmed by the model. De-\nspite the differences in the magnitudes of electron density,\nthe comparison shows that the model is able to represent the\nsunset transition reasonably well.\nThe model results indicate that the sunset transition of\nnegative charge is a combination of VIS and UV sources.\nThe main processes of negative ions releasing an electron\nare listed in Table 1 and the detachment rates of these reac-\ntions at 65 and 72 km are plotted in Figs. 11a\u2013b. All these\nreactions are photon-driven either directly (R4\u2013R6) or indi-\nrectly. R2 and R3 are controlled by UV-related changes in\n198 P. T.

In the\nmiddle panel, the model values multiplied by 1.5 are shown (dashed line) to aid the comparison with the measured values.\natomic oxygen and O2(11g), and the fast reaction R1 is also\nphoton-driven because O\u2212 acts as an intermediate species\nbetween photodissociation of CO\u22123 and fast electron detach-\nment (from O\u2212). At 65 km the UV dependence is strong,\nwith reactions R2\u2013R4 contributing. It is worthwhile to note\nthat the effect of the O2(11g) change is larger than that\nof atomic oxygen change, and that the effect of NO\u22123 pho-\ntodetachment is relatively small. Reactions R1, R4, and R6\ncontribute to the VIS dependence (displaying the drop off\nat 16:00 UT), with R1 being the most important of these.\nAs noted earlier, the VIS dependence of R1 originates from\nCO\u22123 photodissociation. At 75 km, the main VIS dependence\ncomes from R1 and R4, i.e. CO\u22123 and O\n\u2212\n2 . The UV depen-\ndence, which is relatively not as strong as at 65 km, is, for the\nmost part, due to changes in atomic oxygen and O2(11g).\nIn the case of sunrise, the amount of NO determines the\nrelative size of UV and VIS effects by controlling the bal-\nance between NO\u22123 and CO\n\u2212\n3 (Reid, 1987). For our sun-\nset case, we tested the sensitivity of our model by repeating\nthe sunset calculation with a higher amount of NO. Starting\nat 11:00 UT, we manually increased the starting concentra-\ntion by 5 times at all altitudes and then ran the model until\n18:00 UT. The results (see Figs. 11c\u2013d) show that, due to\nNO\u22123 holding a larger portion of the negative charge, 1) the\nUV effect is increased relative to the VIS effect at lower al-\ntitudes (where NO\u22123 and CO\u22123 are the main daytime ions), 2)\nVIS-driven reaction rates R1, R4, and R6 show a more grad-\nual decrease before the total \u201cswitch off\u201d, especially at higher\naltitudes, and 3) the photodetachment of NO\u22123 becomes rela-\ntively more important. The comparison with measured elec-\ntron density profiles, shown in Fig. 9, improves, especially\nat altitudes 75\u201382 km. At altitudes below 70 or 75 km, de-\npending on the UT time, the comparison generally becomes\nworse or at least does not improve. Except for the 14:00 UT\ncase, where photoionization still operates on NO at higher\naltitudes, there is no significant effect on electron densities\nabove 82 km. Therefore, we could speculate that the original\nmodelling underestimates the amount of NO between 70 and\n85 km. Although the increased concentrations of NO, e.g.\n[NO] \u22481015 m\u22123 at 80 km, exceed the measured values, this\ncould perhaps be explained by the differences in illumination\nlevel, which, for the modelling location, is relatively low and\nfavours the downward transport of NO produced at higher\naltitudes.\n4.5 High-energy electron flux\nThe shape of the measured cosmic radio noise absorp-\ntion, which does not follow the decreasing proton forc-\ning but shows a gradual increase during the daylight hours\n(Fig. 8), could be explained by an additional ionization\nsource.

Verronen et al.: Negative charge transition in the D-region during sunset\nthe northern Fennoscandia area, especially that of Oulu\n(65.05\u25e6N, 25.54\u25e6E), which shows a daytime increase by\n\u224825% from a.m. to p.m. hours. The additional source could\nbe auroral electrons, but the discrepancy at 70\u201380 km be-\ntween the measured and modelled electron densities (Fig. 9)\nrequires electrons reaching relativistic energies.\nBy trial and error, we estimated the flux of monoenergetic\nbeam of electrons required to increase the modelled elec-\ntron densities to the measured level. Choosing the energy\nand flux, the resulting ionization rate was calculated follow-\ning Rees (1989, p. 35\u201345) and using electron energy-range\nvalues from Goldberg et al. (1984) and Berger and Seltzer\n(1972). The calculated rate was then input in the model,\ntogether with the proton forcing, and the sunset modelling\nwas rerun. We found that a combination of 650-keV energy\nand 1.45\u00d7109 m\u22122 s\u22121 flux resulted in electron density lev-\nels quite close to the EISCAT measurements. This estimated\nflux is comparable to relatively high fluxes which have been\nmeasured during specific electron precipitation events by,\ne.g., the PET\/SAMPEX instrument (Callis et al., 1996). Ob-\nviously, a monoenergetic and constant-flux beam is hardly a\ngood representative of the real situation, but due to the lack\nof measurements we are limited to this approach, to provide\na rough estimate.\nBy using the increased electron density profiles, the cal-\nculated radio noise absorption values, shown in Fig. 8, sig-\nnificantly increase, and show very good agreement with the\nriometer measurements. Therefore, it seems that an addi-\ntional ionization source, most likely high-energy electrons,\nwas present during the afternoon and sunset hours of 23 Oc-\ntober.\n4.6 Spectral width of EISCAT measurements\nDel Pozo et al. (1999) studied the rapid change in incoherent\nscatter radar spectral width during the sunset of 23 October,\nroughly estimated the sunset change in the oxygen species,\nand concluded that change in atomic oxygen and to a lesser\nextent that of O2(11g) could explain the observations. Our\nmodelling results, shown in Fig. 12, agree with this conclu-\nsion, for the most part. Atomic oxygen and O2(11g) show\nan order of magnitude (or greater) decrease at altitudes below\n65 km, from 14:00 UT to 15:30 UT, which is equal to the re-\nquired reduction estimated by del Pozo et al. (1999). The\nspectral width is about twice as sensitive to the concentration\nto atomic oxygen than that of O2(11g) at lower mesospheric\naltitudes (see Fig. 8 in del Pozo et al., 1999). Thus, above\n65 km, where the absolute reduction of O is equal to or higher\nthan that of O2(11g), the observed spectral width change is\nmostly due to the change in O. At lower altitudes, where\nthe absolute change in O2(11g) is clearly larger than that of\natomic oxygen, the contributions of the two constituents may\nbe more comparable.\n5 Conclusions\nA 1-D neutral and ion chemistry model has been used to in-\nterpret measurements of nitric oxide, cosmic radio noise ab-\nsorption, and electron density made during the great proton\nstorm of October 1989, in high ionization conditions. The\nmodel and the measurements are generally found to be in\ngood agreement. Although there are still great uncertainties\ninvolved, e.g., in the photodetachment rates of ions, with the\ncurrent knowledge we are able to model the D-region iono-\nsphere with some success.\nFor the case considered, the sunset transition of negative\ncharge displays dependency on both visible and ultraviolet\nsolar radiation. The model results show that the UV response\ncomes, for the most part, from atomic oxygen and O2(11g)\nchanges, with a smaller contribution from NO\u22123 photodetach-\nment, while the VIS dependence is driven by reactions of\nO\u22122 and CO\n\u2212\n3 . The relative magnitude of UV and VIS effects\nvary with altitude, with UV playing a larger role at lower alti-\ntudes. These transition characteristics are confirmed by both\nelectron density and cosmic radio noise absorption measure-\nments.\nThese sunset transition characteristics are not sensitive to\nthe momentary ionization level, which determines the abso-\nlute amount of negative (and positive) charge but does not\ndirectly affect the balance between the ions. However, our\nmodelling results are sensitive to the amount of NO which,\nbecause of its relatively long photochemical lifetime, de-\npends upon the ionization history rather than the momen-\ntary ionization. It is therefore important for studies like the\npresent one, to either model NO accurately or use measured\nvalues. However, this requirement can be quite difficult to\nfulfill because of the high variability of NO in the auroral\nregions, where the source is unpredictable and the illumina-\ntion conditions vary significantly with season, and also due\nto spatial and temporal limitations of available data.\nBoth the cosmic radio noise and electron density measure-\nments indicate a possible presence of an additional ionization\nsource, the effect of which is comparable to the ionization\ncaused by the SPE at altitudes 70\u201380 km. By estimating a\nreasonable flux of high-energy electrons and including it in\nour model, the absolute magnitude of modelled values was\nfound to be in excellent agreement with those measured by\nboth instruments. It seems therefore likely that electron pre-\ncipitation which reached relativistic energies occurred during\nthe afternoon and sunset hours on 23 October.\nAccording to our modelling results, sunset decreases in\nthe amount of atomic oxygen and O2(11g) are such that they\ncan be used to explain the observed spectral width changes\nof incoherent scatter radar measurements, as suggested by\ndel Pozo et al. (1999).\nAcknowledgements. The work of P. T. Verronen was partially sup-\nported by the Academy of Finland through the ANTARES space\nresearch programme.
