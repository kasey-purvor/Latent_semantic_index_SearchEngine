In these words, the novelist Samuel Richardson (writing in 1742) sums \nup a common assumption about helping: pro-social behavior reflects an underlying pro-\nsocial impulse. That is, we help out of a desire to do good to others and we refrain from \nhelping when dispositions or circumstances dull that desire. However, a wealth of \nanthropological analyses of gift exchange (e.g., Malinowski, 1922; Mauss 1907\/1957) \nshow the giving of goods or services can reflect other motivations. For example, Mauss \ndescribes customs of giving that are less to do with helping others and more to do with \ndemonstrating one clan\u2019s superiority over others in a local group hierarchy.  \nSuch analyses alert us to the point that acts of giving may be inter-group in nature \nand need to be analysed through reference to the inter-group relations within which they \ntake place. This logic is illustrated in recent social psychological research by Nadler and \nHalabi (Nadler, 2002; Nadler & Halabi, 2006). They show that members of a powerful \ngroup may provide help to members of powerless groups as a means of maintaining the \ndependency of their subordinates. Equally, members of powerless groups may reject help \nfrom powerful groups especially when they are challenging inter-group inequalities. The \nwider implication is that helping can be grounded less in a desire to alleviate the plight of \nthe recipient than in an attempt to improve the lot of the donor. It does not always reveal \na \u2018God-like\u2019 disposition.  \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 4 \nThis paper explores further the group interests that inter-group helping may \nservice. We seek to show that helping others \u2013 especially out-group others \u2013 may be \nincreased where group members wish to ameliorate the perceptions held about one\u2019s \ngroup by others. Specifically, we explore whether telling Scots that the English consider \nthem to be mean results in increased helping towards representatives of a third-party \nnational out-group (the Welsh).  Before explaining the context to our studies and our \nhypotheses, we outline the grounds for studying helping as a group phenomenon and then \nconsider the strategic side of group behavior. \n \nHelping as a group process \nFrom its inception, helping research addressed collective phenomena. Much \nattention focused on the idea that the larger the group, the greater the diffusion of \nresponsibility such that each individual feels less obligation to act (Latan\u00e9 & Nida, 1981). \nYet, from early on, it was clear that the presence of fellow bystanders can, under certain \nconditions, increase intervention, especially when other bystanders help (Bryan & Test, \n1967). What seems critical is the extent to which people see themselves as belonging to a \ncommon social group (Darley, Teger and Lewis, 1973; Horowitz, 1971; Rutkowski, \nGruder & Romer, 1983). Where they do, they will be influenced by the actions of their \nfellows, whether in the direction of intervention or non-intervention. Where they don\u2019t, \nthe actions of one bystander will have little impact upon that of others (Levine, Cassidy, \nBrazier & Reicher, 2002). In short, what matters is not so much whether bystanders \nconstitute a physical group but rather whether they constitute a psychological group \n(Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher & Wetherell, 1987), and, if they are a psychological \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 5 \ngroup, whether their norms support or oppose intervention (Horowitz, 1971; Rutkowski \net al., 1983). \nA similar argument can be made concerning the relationship between bystanders \nand victims. People are more likely to feel concern for those seen as belonging to the \nsame group as themselves and hence are more likely to help them (Dovidio, Gaertner, \nValidizic, Matoka, Johnson & Frazier, 1997; Levine, et al., 2002; Sturmer, Snyder & \nOmoto, 2005). What is more, when the boundaries of in-group inclusion are drawn more \nbroadly we become more inclusive in terms of who we will help (Levine, Prosser, Evans \n& Reicher, 2005). \nWork on the psychology of volunteerism shows the importance of common group \nmembership is not limited to face-to face-helping but extends to broader forms of social \nsolidarity. The more that people identify with a particular community the more they are \nlikely to volunteer for organizations which provide support for that community (Simon, \nSturmer and Steffens, 2000). Such collective action may have greater impact than \nindividual interventions in cases of emergency. For example, whereas acts of individual \nbravery undoubtedly saved individual Jews from the Nazi holocaust the large-scale \ncollective mobilizations in countries such as Bulgaria saved many more (Genov & Baeva, \n2003). Analysis of the key documents addressed to the Bulgarian population shows that \nboth definitions of shared group membership and in-group norms were important in the \nrescue of Bulgarian Jews (Reicher, Cassidy, Wolpert, Hopkins & Levine, 2006; Todorov, \n2001). Jewish people were consistently construed as a Bulgarian (in-group) minority \nrather than a religious or ethnic out-group and Bulgarian identity was associated with \nnorms opposing oppression.  \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 6 \nThere is therefore archival, survey and experimental research demonstrating the \ntheoretical and practical importance of group processes for helping.  This evidence shows \nhow the cognitive salience of category membership and category content affects the \nsupport we give to others. \n \nThe strategic side of group helping \nReicher et al. (2006) identify one further argument used to promote the rescue of \nBulgarian Jews: if Bulgaria wished to be regarded as a \u2018civilized nation\u2019 it could not be \ncomplicit in mass slaughter. This argument has less to do with defining the boundaries to \nin-group inclusion and group norms, and more to do with advancing group interests. It \ntherefore fits with a growing literature stressing the need to consider the strategic \ndimension to group action (see Klein et al, in press; Reicher, Spears and Postmes, 1995). \nOf particular interest is the idea that actors may seek to induce others to see their group as \nthey themselves wish it to be seen. For example, Klein & Azzi (2001) show that group \nmembers, when confronted with an out-group depiction of their in-group will confirm \npositive aspects of this stereotype yet disconfirm the negative aspects. \nOur work develops this logic. It explores how group helping behaviors may be a \nway of responding to specific types of perceived negative out-group stereotypes (in \nsaying this, we do not dispute that there may be other ways of doing so, but our concern \nhere is to do with meta-stereotype disconfirmation as a basis for helping and not with the \nbases of meta-stereotype disconfirmation per se). While helping has positive moral \nconnotations which may serve to ameliorate negative out-group stereotypes in general, \nwe expect that the meanings associated with such actions will be particularly effective in \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 7 \ndisconfirming stereotypes that portray the in-group as having specific anti-social \ncharacteristics: being selfish or egocentric. This is not to say that there may not be other \nways of disconfirming such stereotypes. Our point is rather that one reason that people \nhelp is to demonstrate their generosity to doubting others. In turn this implies that people \nare likely to help more when confronted with such out-group doubts.  \nFurthermore, we suggest that the motive to disconfirm \u2018mean\u2019 stereotypes of the \nin-group impacts specifically upon out-group helping \u2013 something of particular note since \nthe group processes discussed above impact uniquely on help accorded to other in-group \nmembers. This difference is because help, as we conceptualise it here, is an act of \ncommunication which means that we must consider the communicational value of \ndifferent forms of helping. Thus, helping \u201cone\u2019s own\u201d is weakly diagnostic of a group\u2019s \nqualities: such help is to be expected from any group and can easily be construed as \nselfish and sectarian. By contrast, helping out-group members is more noteworthy and \ndiagnostic. This is readily apparent in the biblical parable of \u2018The Good Samaritan\u2019 in \nwhich a Samaritan helps a Levite at a time when Samaritans were regarded by Jews as a \nrival ethnic out-group. That the act of helping depicted here is inter-group is crucial to the \nparable\u2019s power. Such helping is unexpected and cannot be dismissed as an example of \ngroup members simply looking after \u2018their own\u2019. \nDrawing these points together, we propose that out-group helping may be used to \nchallenge negative out-group stereotypes in general and \u201cmean\u201d hetero-stereotypes in \nparticular. We predict that, where group members are made aware that a significant out-\ngroup stereotypes them as mean, they will emphasize their helpfulness, specifically \nthrough increasing levels of helping to a third party out-group. However, not all group \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 8 \nmembers will be equally motivated to act in this way. How people respond to negative \ncharacterizations of their group (and other threats to collective identity) depends upon \ntheir degree of group identification, with high identifiers being more motivated to act in \nways that defend\/promote the in-group (Branscome, Ellemers, Spears & Doosje, 1999). It \ntherefore follows that our predicted effect should be greater amongst high identifiers. \n \nThe present research \nOur research explores how the helping behavior of Scots is affected when their \nreputation for being mean is made salient. The stereotype of the Scots as mean is \nwidespread and features as an illustrative example in Allport\u2019s 1954 classic \u201cThe Nature \nof Prejudice\u201d. \u2018A Scotsman who is penurious\u2019, he writes, \u2018delights us because he \nvindicates our prejudgement\u2019 (p. 22). This stereotype continues to have popular currency \nand continues to annoy Scottish people. This is well illustrated in the way Scots react to \nthe jokes told about their meanness. For instance one website reports a number of such \njokes and then retorts that Scots give more to registered charities per head of population \nthan any other part of the UK 1. \nThroughout our research we also sought to capitalize on the inter-group \nrelationship between the Scots and the English. Scotland and England are united in a \nsingle state, yet although Scots may define themselves as British, a Scottish identification \nremains potent and is bound up with inter-group comparisons with the (historically more \npowerful) English rival (Hopkins & Moore, 2001). Scots often complain that the English \nare arrogant and ignorant about their northern neighbors and resent the way they are \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 9 \ncharacterized (or more accurately, think they are characterized) by the English (Reicher \n& Hopkins, 2001).  \nIn our research we encouraged our participants, who were young Scots, to reflect \nupon the Scottish-English relationship and the degree to which they are seen by the \nEnglish as being mean. In the first Study, we investigated whether Scots believed \nthemselves to be seen as mean by the English (that is we investigated what may be \ntermed their meta-stereotype, see Vorauer, Main and O\u2019Connell, 1998). We also \ninvestigated participants\u2019 beliefs about how they could refute this image. In the second \nStudy, we manipulated the salience of an English stereotype of the Scots as mean and \nexamined how this affected participants\u2019 depiction of the Scottish in-group. In the third, \nand main Study, we included a behavioral measure of helping and explored how in-group \nand out-group helping behavior was affected by manipulating the salience of an English \nstereotype of the Scots as mean. Our hypotheses (and the studies that address them) are as \nfollows: \n \nH1: Young Scots believe that they are viewed as mean by the English, believe that this \nstereotype not to be justified, are motivated to challenge the stereotype and believe that \nout-group helping is particularly effective in  doing so (Study 1). \nH2: The more the mean meta-stereotype is salient, the more Scots will seek to present the \nScots as generous (Study 2) and (H2a), in particular, the more they will behave helpfully \nto a third-party out-group (Study 3). \n \n \nStudy 1 \n \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 10 \nIntroduction \nThis is a preliminary investigation to validate the assumptions underpinning our \nsubsequent experimental studies. Following hypothesis 1 above, we wish to show, first, \nthat Scots believe the English see them as mean, second that they see such a view as \nunwarranted, third that they are motivated to disconfirm it, and fourth, that they view out-\ngroup helping as more effective than in-group helping in disconfirming such a stereotype. \n \nMethod \nParticipants. Our aim in this Study is not to make a claim about the Scots in \ngeneral and hence we do not seek a representative sample drawn from the Scottish \npopulation as a whole. Rather, we are concerned with the views of the samples from \nwhom the participants in our experiments will be drawn \u2013 namely Scottish undergraduate \nstudents studying at a Scottish University. Hence this Study was conducted using twenty-\nsix Scottish undergraduates studying at a Scottish University. \nMaterials. Participants completed a questionnaire which consisted of three \nelements. First, a number of traits were listed including, critically, \u201cmean\u201d, \u201ctight-fisted\u201d, \n\u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cunrealistic\u201d. For each trait, participants were asked to rate on a 10 point \nscale (anchored 1 = not at all and 10 = very much):  \u201cto what extent you think this is \ncharacteristic of Scots in general?\u201d The ratings for the traits \u201cmean\u201d and \u201ctight-fisted\u201d \nwere correlated (r = .72, p =.001) and averaged into a single score, as were the ratings for \n\u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cunrealistic\u201d (r = .51, p = .01). For each trait participants were also asked \u201cto \nwhat extent you think non-Scots sometimes describe the Scots as being like this?\u201d. The \nratings for the traits \u201cmean\u201d and \u201ctight-fisted\u201d correlated (r = .55, p = .004) and were \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 11 \naveraged into a single score, as were the ratings for \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cunrealistic\u201d (r = .79, p = \n.001) . \nSecond, participants were given one of two scripts. Both purportedly described \nhow the English perceive the Scots. One (n = 12) emphasised the meanness of the Scots \n(mean meta-stereotype salient), the other (n=14) focussed on alternative negative \ncharacteristics (mean meta-stereotype non-salient). After reading these texts participants \nwere asked to rate on a 10 point scale (1 = not at all and 10 = very much): \u201cTo what \nextent do you think this is a fair and accurate description of the Scots?\u201d and \u201cIf the \nEnglish said the Scots were like this, would you feel like acting in ways that prove them \nwrong?\u201d. The texts of the two scripts were as follows: \n \nMean meta-stereotype salient condition \nThe negative adjectives most commonly attributed to the Scots were \u201cmean\u201d, \n\u201cungenerous\u201d and \u201ctight-fisted\u201d. Similar ideas were apparent in our \ninterviews. Thus one English respondent argued that \u201cperhaps it has to do \nwith their history, I don\u2019t know, but they seem to be an inward looking \nsociety which leads to an attitude of \u2018well, I\u2019ll look after myself and my own \nand let others look after themselves\u2019\u201d. Another said, \u201cyou can dress it up as \nbeing \u2018careful\u2019 or whatever but basically they are really mean with their \nmoney\u201d. Another English respondent argued that the Scots were \u201camazingly \nhard-nosed\u201d and that they were so bothered with \u201cbalancing the books they \ngo to the mean-spirited, penny-pinching extreme\u201d. She continued \u201ceveryone \nknows this - they just go to the extreme and that level of meanness is just \nsilly: ask anyone.\u201d \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 12 \n \nMean meta-stereotype non-salient condition \n \nThe negative adjectives most commonly attributed to the Scots were \u201cna\u00efve\u201d, \n\u201cunrealistic\u201d and \u201closers\u201d. Similar ideas were apparent in our interviews. \nThus one English respondent argued that \u201cthey\u2019ve always had this unrealistic \noutlook - they squander time and money on romantic sounding schemes \nwhich never actually deliver what they are meant to\u201d. Another said, \u201cyou can \ndress it up as being \u2018romantic\u2019 or whatever but basically they are losers who \nprefer easy gestures to the tough decisions that are needed to make things \nhappen\u201d. Yet another English respondent argued that the Scots were \n\u201camazingly naive\u201d and that they had no idea about the importance of such \nthings as \u201censuring what they want is practically possible - they go to the \nstarry-eyed extreme\u201d. She continued \u201ceveryone knows this - they just go to \nthe extreme and that level of naivety is just silly: ask anyone.\u201d \n \nIn the mean meta-stereotype salient condition participants also completed a third \nelement of the questionnaire. This consisted of the question: \u201cif you wanted to show \nEnglish people that the stereotype of Scots as mean is unfair and untrue, what sort of \nbehaviors do you think would be most likely to persuade them?\u201d followed by six options, \nthree relating to helping a Scot and three to helping a non-Scot (\u201cHelping a fellow \nScot\/foreigner in distress\u201d, \u201cGiving money to a charity specifically for people in\/outside \nScotland\u201d,  \u201cGiving up one\u2019s time for a voluntary organization supporting Scots\/non-\nScots\u201d). Each was rated on 10 point scales (1 = not at all to 10 = very much). The three \nitems referring to helping in-group members were added together (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .52), \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 13 \nas were the three items referring to out-group helping (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .85). As the \nreliability of the in-group helping scale was weak we also constructed scales excluding \nthe weakest item. The resultant 2-item scales (comprising the items referring to helping \nsomeone in distress and to giving to charity) were both reliable  (in-group helping \nCronbach \u03b1 = .76, out-group Cronbach \u03b1 = .72).  \n \nResults \nIn this study, as in the subsequent studies, all reported  p values are two-tailed. \nTrait ratings. Paired t-tests show that participants thought that non-Scots would \nsee Scots as mean\/tight-fisted (M = 6.26, SD = 2.24) more than they themselves would \n(M = 2.98, SD = 1.85), t(24) = - 5.58, p <.001, \u03b72  =.56. A similar but weaker pattern was \nfound for the traits na\u00efve\/unrealistic. Participants thought that non-Scots would see Scots \nin these terms (M = 4.28, SD = 2.55) more than they themselves did (M = 2.44, SD = \n1.54), t(24) = - 4.32, p <.001, \u03b72  = .44. When these data were analyzed in a 2 (Adjective \ntype: mean\/tight-fisted and na\u00efve\/unrealistic) x 2 (Source of Judgment: self and non-\nScots) ANOVA, the interaction was significant, F (1, 24) = 6.98, p = .014 (\u03b7p2 = .23) \nillustrating that the magnitude of the discrepancy between Scots auto- and meta-\nstereotypes was greater for the mean\/tight-fisted dimension than the na\u00efve\/unrealistic \ndimension. \nReactions to the meta-stereotype. Participants saw both texts as moderately unfair \ndescriptions of the Scots, and there was no difference between them in the degree to \nwhich they were rated as fair and accurate depictions (mean meta-stereotype non-salient \nM = 4.57, SD = 2.03 vs. salient M = 3.83, SD = 2.76, t(24) = .79, p = .44). Participants \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 14 \nwere also quite motivated to prove that both stereotypes were inaccurate (mean meta-\nstereotype non-salient M = 5.50, SD = 2.50 vs. salient M = 6.42, SD = 2.88, t(24) = -.87, \np = .39). \nRefuting the meta-stereotype. When those in the mean meta-stereotype salient \ncondition were asked what sort of behaviors could refute the image of the Scots as mean, \nscores on the 3-item scale showed that out-group helping (M = 7.11, SD = 2.18) would be \nmore effective than in-group helping (M = 4.61, SD = 1.63), t(11) = -3.10, p =.01, \u03b72  \n=.47. The same pattern was found on the 2-item scale (M out-group helping = 7.08, SD = \n2.19, M in-group helping = 4.33, SD = 2.00), t(11) = -3.21, p =.01, \u03b72  =.48. A similar \npattern was found on the remaining item excluded from the 2-item scale, (M giving time \nto a voluntary organization supporting non-Scots = 7.17, SD = 2.52, M giving time to a \nvoluntary organization supporting Scots = 5.17, SD = 2.37), t(11) = -2.03, p =.067, \u03b72  \n=.27. \n \nDiscussion \nThree findings from this Study are of relevance for our subsequent investigations. \nFirst, young Scots do indeed believe that the English see them as mean. Second, they \nconsider this stereotype to be unfair and are motivated to refute it. Third, they consider \nout-group helping to be more effective than in-group helping in refuting the mean \nstereotype.  \nThis Study shows the mean meta-stereotype to be valid and that our sample \nbelieve it could be affected by (out-group) helping. What we need to show now is that \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 15 \nmanipulating the salience of this meta-stereotype is consequential and does indeed impact \non helping behaviors. \n \nStudy 2 \nIntroduction \nThis Study examines the effects of making the mean meta-stereotype more or less \nsalient to a sample akin to that used in Study 1. Our prediction (following H2 above) is \nthat where the meta-stereotype is salient, young Scots will emphasize to the English that \ntheir group is helpful.  \nIt is important at this juncture to make explicit a point which thus far has been \nimplicit. We have argued that the relationship between meta-stereotypes and helping is \nbased on a strategic process of communication whereby in-group members seek to shape \nwhat out-group members think of them. As such, the process is dependent upon the acts \nof the in-group being visible to the out-group. In order to achieve this we drew on the \nrelationship between the experimenter and participants as a key feature of the \nexperimental context (see Marques, Yzerbyt & Rijsman, 1988; Reicher & Levine, 1994). \nThat is, in Study 2 (and Study 3 as well) the experimenter was English and stressed his \ninterest in finding out what the Scots are like. The clear implication was that, in their \nresponses, the Scots participants would be communicating with an influential \nrepresentative of the English out-group. Hence the conditions are met for in-group \nmembers to use helping as a means of altering out-group stereotypes. \nMethod \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 16 \nDesign. The Study had one between-subjects factor with two levels. The factor \nwas salience of the mean meta-stereotype (salient vs. non-salient). \nParticipants. Thirty Scottish undergraduates attending a Scottish university \ncompleted one of two questionnaires. One of these failed to complete the answer booklet \nresulting in twenty-nine (8 males and 21 females) with usable returns (salient condition n \n= 14, non-salient condition n = 15). \nMaterials. Meta-stereotype salience was manipulated by getting people either to \nreflect on English-Scottish differences (inter-group comparison) or to reflect on how the \nEnglish stereotype the Scots (meta-stereotype salient condition). \nFirst, participants completed open-ended questions. In the inter-group comparison \ncondition, participants listed three characteristics describing the English and three \ndescribing the Scottish. In the meta-stereotype salient condition participants listed three \ncharacteristics which they thought non-Scots commonly used to describe Scots. They also \nhighlighted those they thought to be untrue or unfair.  \nSecond, participants completed a trait-rating task. In the inter-group comparison \ncondition participants rated the extent to which 11 adjectives applied to the English (rated \non 7-point scales anchored 1 = not at all, 7 = very much).  Six adjectives referred to \nworking hard (\u201chardworking\u201d, \u201cindustrious\u201d, \u201cproductive\u201d, \u201clazy\u201d (reversed), \u201cefficient\u201d \nand \u201corganized\u201d) and five referred to being mean (\u201cmean\u201d, \u201ctight-fisted\u201d, \u201cpenny-\npinching\u201d, \u201cgenerous\u201d (reversed) and \u201cstingy\u201d). The items on both dimensions formed \nreliable scales (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 =  .73 and .87 respectively). In the meta-stereotype salient \ncondition participants were asked to indicate the extent to which the English use these \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 17 \nsame adjectives to characterize Scots. Again, the items on both the hard working and \nmean dimensions formed reliable scales (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .86 and .84 respectively). \nThe open-ended questions and the rating scales constituted the independent \nvariable. The dependent measures referred to the Scots\u2019 auto-stereotype and had two \nelements. First, participants rated the 11 adjectives again, but this time indicating how \nmuch they themselves thought the adjectives applied to Scots. Second, they answered the \nquestion: \u201cper head of population, how much do you think Scots give to charity each \nyear?\u201d. This had 9 responses altering in 5% increments from  20% less than the UK \naverage to 20% more than the UK average. The mid-point was The same as the UK \naverage. This question was designed to provide an opportunity to depict the in-group as \ngenerous and is not relevant to exploring the issue of the form of helping (i.e., in-group or \nout-group). \nThe questionnaire also contained questions concerning national identity (located \nat the questionnaire\u2019s beginning to increase the salience of participants\u2019 Scottishness). \nThe items were: \u201cThis national identity is very important to me\u201d, \u201cThis nationality means \nlittle to me\u201d (reversed), \u201cI feel proud to have this nationality\u201d and \u201cThis national identity \nhas no emotional significance for me\u201d (reversed) answered on 7-point scales (1 = \ndisagree, 7 = agree). These items formed a reliable scale (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 =  0.89).  \nProcedure.  The two versions of the questionnaire were distributed randomly \namongst students attending a psychology practical class at a Scottish University. The \nclass was run by an English lecturer (also the experimenter) whose accent was clearly \nEnglish. He explained that the questionnaires were anonymous, but that the class (which \nincluded students from a number of other countries, including England) would explore \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 18 \nthe results. Moreover, he stressed that these results would help his research concerning \nthe nature of Scottish identity. In this way, the issue of national identity was made salient \nand it was made explicit that the responses of participants would be subject to out-group \nscrutiny. \nThe questionnaire took approximately fifteen minutes to complete. After all \nparticipants had completed the measures there was a full debriefing by the experimenter. \n \nResults \nPreliminary analyses.  Overall participants generally identified very highly as \nScots (on the 7-point scale, M = 5.76, SD = 1.01). It was marginally higher in the mean \nmeta-stereotype non-salient condition than the salient condition (M = 6.10, SD = .65 vs. \nM = 5.39, SD = 1.21),  t(27) = 1.98, p = .059. \nResponses to the open-ended questions in the meta-stereotype salient condition \nconfirmed the importance of the meanness dimension. Of the 14 participants 7 referred to \nthe Scots being mean. Specifically, participants referred to the Scots reputation for being \n\u201ctight-fisted\u201d or \u201ctight with money\u201d (listed by four), \u201cstingy\u201d (listed by two) or \u201cshrewd \nwith money\u201d (listed by one). One described the Scots as having a reputation for being \ngenerous. Of the 7 referring to the dimension of meanness, all reported that this was \nunfair, and it is noteworthy that two made spontaneous reference to Scottish charitable \ngiving. One, referring to the Scots\u2019 reputation for being \u201ctight-fisted\u201d, commented that \nthis was \u201cunfair and untrue! Generosity is shown a lot by Scottish people \u2013 especially for \ncharity\/aid\u201d. The other commented \u201cThe shrewd with money characteristic is clearly a \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 19 \nmyth as research has proven that Scottish people give more to charity than English people \ndo\u201d.  \nFurther evidence as to the nature of the Scots meta-stereotype may be gained from \ninspecting the trait-rating data in the meta-stereotype condition. The scale means show \nthat they thought the English would rate the Scots as moderately hardworking (M = 3.85, \nSD = .81) and rather mean (M = 4.56, SD = 1.32).  \nScottish auto-stereotype.  On the items related to working hard, there was no \neffect of condition (M salient condition = 4.80, SD = .57, M non-salient condition = 4.92, \nSD = .68; t (27) = .53, p = .60). Yet, as predicted, there was an effect of condition on the \nitems related to being mean. The Scots were construed as less mean in the mean meta-\nstereotype salient condition (M = 2.19, SD = .54) than in the non-salient condition (M = \n3.09, SD = .94), t (22.6) = 3.20, p = .004, \u03b72  = . 31. \nGiven that the differences in levels of identification between conditions \napproached significance the last analysis was repeated using identity scores as the \ncovariate. Taking these scores into account served to strengthen the effect of condition \nupon the mean auto-stereotype (F(1,26) = 14.58, p = 0.01, \u03b7p2 =  .36) with the estimated \nmarginal mean in the meta-stereotype salient condition being less (M = 2.08) than in the \nnon-salient condition (M = 3.19). \nThe estimates of charitable giving were higher in the mean meta-stereotype \nsalient condition (M = 6.57, SD = 1.28) than the non-salient condition (M = 5.33, SD = \n1.88), t (27) = -2.06, p = .049, \u03b72  = .14. Again, this analysis was repeated in an \nANCOVA taking the identity scores into account. As expected, the estimated marginal \nmean was higher when the meta-stereotype was salient (M = 6.74) than when it was not \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 20 \n(M = 5.18) with this difference being rather stronger than before, F(1,26) = 6.09, p = \n0.02, \u03b7p2 = .19. \n \nDiscussion \nThese results support our hypothesis (H2) that, when the English meta-stereotype \nof Scots as mean is salient, Scots will seek to demonstrate that they are actually generous \nand helpful. They both describe themselves as more generous in general terms (trait \nratings) and in terms of concrete instances (estimates of relative charitable giving).  \nThe meta-stereotype salience manipulation also had a marginal effect on levels of \nScottish identification. However when this effect is controlled for, the effects of condition \non the extent to which Scots portray themselves as mean only becomes stronger. Thus it \nis difficult to explain the findings in terms of a generic cognitive consequence of social \nidentification such as, say, positive in-group differentiation (Tajfel, 1978). Indeed \nparticipants describe themselves more positively (i.e. as less mean) in the meta-stereotype \nsalient condition where identity is, if anything, less salient.  \nIt should be noted that in both conditions participants are directed to think about \nthe relationship between the English and themselves as Scots. Hence, our results cannot \nbe put down to some other effects of comparative context (such as its effects on the in-\ngroup prototype: Turner et al., 1987) beyond salience of identification. Rather they seem \nto be due to the fact that only in the meta-stereotype condition are participants to think \nabout what the English think of them and what they themselves think of these thoughts. \nIt is also noteworthy that the effect of meta-stereotype salience is obtained only \non the mean items and not those measuring hard-working. This sustains our contention \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 21 \nthat helping is not so much a means of making the in-group look good in general but \nrather a means of refuting the specific notion that the in-group is mean.  \nHowever it is important to note that as we do not measure actual helping \nbehaviors our effects are limited to Scots\u2019 self-descriptions: it is one thing to describe \none\u2019s group as generous, it is quite another to give generously. Furthermore, we only \nmeasure self-descriptions of helping in general. Therefore we are unable to ascertain \nwhether meta-stereotype salience impacts upon certain types of helping - notably out-\ngroup helping - more than others (our H2a as outlined in the Introduction).  \nIn our third and final Study, we address these limitations. Specifically, we explore \nwhether increasing the salience of the mean meta-stereotype results in higher levels of \nactual giving to the out-group in particular. \n \n \nStudy 3 \n \nIntroduction \nIn Study 3 we again manipulate the salience of the mean meta-stereotype but now \nexamine behavioral consequences in terms of actual helping to in-group and out-group \nmembers. In this final Study, participants are given a text which purportedly describes \nhow they are viewed by the English. One version (mean meta-stereotype salient) stresses \nthat the English see them as mean, the other (mean meta-stereotype non-salient) stresses a \ndifferent flaw \u2013 that the English see them as na\u00efve and unrealistic.  \nThe advantage of this procedure is the greater equivalence between conditions \nand the greater directness of the manipulation. Had we employed such directness in Study \n2, it might have led participants to guess the true purpose of the experiment, especially as \nthe dependent measures came immediately after the manipulation (hence it was necessary \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 22 \nto have a more indirect manipulation). However, in Study 3 the cover story is more \nelaborate and the dependent measure is, ostensibly, not part of the experiment. Hence, \neven with a direct meta-stereotype manipulation the relationship to helping remains \nopaque to participants. \nTo recap, we predict that our Scottish participants will be more helpful when they \nare told the English think them to be mean as opposed to na\u00efve, especially where the \nrecipient of help is an out-group member.  \n \nMethod \nDesign. The design had two between-subjects factors, each with two levels. The \nfirst was the salience of the mean meta-stereotype (Salient vs. Non-salient). The second \nwas the recipient of help (In-group vs. Out-group). \nParticipants. One hundred and ten undergraduate Scottish students (37 males, 73 \nfemales) attending a Scottish University participated in return for a course credit. \nParticipants (from the same class) took part in the experiment in four groups (each \ncorresponding to one experimental condition). The allocation to condition was random. \nThe cell sizes were as follows: Mean meta-stereotype salient, In-group recipient = 27; \nMean meta-stereotype salient, Out-group recipient = 30; Mean meta-stereotype non-\nsalient, In-group recipient = 24; Mean meta-stereotype non-salient, Out-group recipient = \n29. \nMaterials. The meta-stereotype was manipulated by giving participants \ninformation that supposedly came from a survey conducted by the experimenters \nconcerning how English people viewed the Scots. To make the manipulation plausible it \nwas embedded within text explaining that the English did not see the Scots in completely \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 23 \nnegative terms (the Scots were also seen as \u201chard-working\u201d, \u201cbrave\u201d and \n\u201cconscientious\u201d). The section containing the manipulation either stressed that the English \nsee the Scots as mean or as na\u00efve. These texts are identical to those in Study 1. \nThe manipulation of the recipient of help was contained in an appeal from a \n(fictional) charity working with victims of violent crime. In the In-group conditions, the \ncharity was called \u201cSupport Scottish Victims of Violence\u201d and the relevant materials \ncontained a Scottish flag. In the Out-group conditions, the charity was called \u201cSupport \nWelsh Victims of Violence\u201d and the relevant materials carried a Welsh flag. \nThe dependent variable was the amount of helping volunteered. Helping was \nmeasured using two behavioral indices.  Participants had to indicate first, how many \nraffle tickets (priced 10p \u2013 roughly 17 cents \u2013 each) they would buy from the fictional \ncharity, and, second, how many books of tickets (containing 10 tickets each) they would \nsell.  \nParticipants completed three further measures. The first was a scale of Scottish \nidentification (four items answered on 7-point scales, Cronbach\u2019s alpha = .92). The \nsecond was an auto-stereotype scale. This included seven items related to being mean \n(\u201cScots are generous\u201d, \u201cScots are helpful\u201d, \u201cScots are charitable\u201d, \u201cScots are mean\u201d \n(reversed), \u201cThe Scottish are generally helpful people\u201d, \u201cThe Scottish will put themselves \nout for anybody in need\u201d and \u201cThe Scots have a strong sense of responsibility toward \nother people in general\u201d) answered on 7-point scales (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely) \n(Cronbach\u2019s alpha = .83). The third addressed whether people recalled the manipulation \nof the meta-stereotype correctly. It asked \u201cwhat negative Scottish characteristic did the \nEnglish comment on?\u201d \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 24 \n \nProcedure \nThe Study was introduced as exploring group processes and memory. Participants \nwere told the researchers were studying Scottish people\u2019s memories for what the English \nthought about them. Both researchers were English and as they were not attached to the \nuniversity in which the study was being conducted were able to present themselves as \nvisitors from an English university. An English member of staff working in the \nparticipants\u2019 department (hereafter, the \u201chost\u201d) introduced the researchers. \nThe researchers explained they were studying English people\u2019s images of Scots \nand had come to Scotland to meet some \u201creal-life\u201d Scots because this would help their \nresearch. They explained they would present their findings concerning the English \nstereotype of Scots which would be followed by a memory test that would be scored by \nthe researchers. Each participant was given a response booklet entitled \u201cGroup Processes \nand Memory Performance. English Views of Scots: Recall Test\u201d and bearing colored \npictures of the Scottish and English flags. Participants identified themselves by recording \ntheir group name (\u201cScottish\u201d) and an individual number.  \nThe booklet contained all the texts and memory test items. Participants were \nallowed 90 seconds to digest the meta-stereotype information (which varied according to \ncondition). After a further 120 seconds they completed the recall test. This not only \nmaintained the cover story but contained a question to check their memory for how they \nwere seen by the English. \nFollowing the test the researchers collected the answer booklets and, leaving the \nroom, explained they would return after marking participants\u2019 memory performance. \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 25 \nThey apologized that this would take 10 minutes, and following a previously arranged \nscript, the host replied that this was alright because a postgraduate student had asked to \nmake an announcement that could conveniently happen now. \nAfter the experimenters left a confederate entered and explained that she had \ncompleted an MSc in Cardiff (Wales) and was now pursuing this work for a PhD in \nScotland. She explained that her PhD concerned people\u2019s experiences of coping with \ncrimes such as being attacked in bars or clubs and described her involvement in a victim \nsupport group. In the In-group helping conditions, the confederate described her current \nwork as relating to the experience of crime in Scotland. In the Out-group helping \nconditions, she described her current work in identical terms, except that it related to the \nexperience of crime in Wales. In all conditions the confederate explained she was helping \nthe victim support group raise money through a raffle. Tickets were priced at 10p each \nwith prizes including wine, CDs, etc. Participants were asked to volunteer to buy and sell \nthese tickets, and each was given a form to show how many tickets they would personally \nbuy, and how many books of tickets they would be willing to sell (although it was \nstressed that help was entirely voluntary). Participants were told that there was not time \nto collect money or hand out raffle booklets so those volunteering would be contacted \nlater. \nAfter the appeal the postgraduate confederate claimed to have to leave for another \nappointment, and the host explained that she (the host) would gather the forms for her. \nThis allowed the experimenters to match the volunteering form with the participants\u2019 \nquestionnaire. Furthermore, as the host was English and working with the English \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 26 \nexperimenters, this arrangement implied that participants\u2019 helping would be visible to an \nEnglish audience.  \nFollowing completion of the volunteering forms the researchers returned. \nAlthough they claimed to have marked the test, the scores reported (in the form of a \npercentage) were contrived and varied between 78% and 82%. After participants received \ntheir scored booklet, they completed another questionnaire concerning their level of \nScottish identification and their Scottish auto-stereotype.  Once completed, the answer \nbooklet, helping form and identification questionnaire were placed into individual \nenvelopes. Participants were told that the experiment was finished and then took part in a \nstructured debrief. \n \nResults \n \nPreliminary analyses.  \nManipulation check. Participants\u2019 recall of the meta-stereotype manipulation was \ninvestigated through exploring responses to the question \u201cwhat negative Scottish \ncharacteristic did the English comment on?\u201d In each condition participants were given \nfour response options: the correct answer (salient condition: \u201cungenerous\u201d; non-salient \ncondition: \u201cna\u00efve\u201d), a synonym of the correct answer (salient condition: \u201cpenny \npinching\u201d; non-salient condition: \u201ctrusting\u201d) and two semantically incorrect answers \n(salient condition: \u201ccontempt for others\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d; non-salient condition: \n\u201cidealistic\u201d and \u201cimpractical\u201d). Participants were accurate in their answers. In the mean \nmeta-stereotype salient conditions all 56 participants chose either the correct response or \nits synonym (Correct, in-group recipient = 17; Correct, out-group recipient = 19; \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 27 \nSynonym, in-group recipient = 10; Synonym, out-group recipient = 10). In the mean \nmeta-stereotype non-salient conditions all 53 participants chose the correct response. \nIdentification. Participants\u2019 identification as Scottish was highly skewed towards \nthe high end of the 7-point scale (mode = 7, MDN = 6.5, M = 6.0, SD = 1.27, skewness = \n-1.65, kurtosis = 2.40). As there was not enough variation to analyse the effect of level of \nidentification we restricted our analyses to high identifiers since this is the sample for \nwhich we would expect the meta-stereotype manipulation to be consequential. We used a \ncriterion score of 5.5 for \u2018high identifiers\u2019 because it is the point at which, more often \nthan not, people are expressing strong agreement with statements about their \nidentification. This led to the inclusion of 88 participants (29 males, 59 females). The \nresultant cell sizes were: mean meta-stereotype salient, in-group recipient = 21; mean \nmeta-stereotype, out-group recipient = 23; mean meta-stereotype non-salient, in-group \nrecipient = 20; mean meta-stereotype non-salient, out-group recipient\u2019 = 24. Levels of \nidentification were extremely high in all conditions: mean meta-stereotype salient, in-\ngroup recipient M = 6.51 (SD = .48); mean meta-stereotype salient, out-group recipient \nM = 6.62 (SD = .43); mean meta-stereotype non-salient, in-group recipient M = 6.45 (SD \n= .54); mean meta-stereotype non-salient, out-group recipient M = 6.59 (SD = .47). \nAnalysis revealed no effects of condition. \nHelping. The raffle-ticket buying data were not normally distributed. For the 88 \nhigh identifiers the numbers volunteering to buy tickets were: zero tickets = 20; 1 ticket = \n1;  3 tickets = 1; 5 tickets = 12; 10 tickets = 37; 20 tickets = 11; 30 tickets = 3; 50 tickets \n= 3 (skewness = 2.051; kurtosis = 5.476). The raffle book selling data were even more \nnon-normally distributed: zero books = 63; 1 book = 2; 2 books = 3; 3 books = 2; 4 books \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 28 \n= 1; 5 books = 6; 10 books = 8; 20 books = 2; 50 books = 1 (skewness = 4.998; kurtosis = \n31.990). We suspect the large number refusing to sell tickets reflects the multi-\ndimensional nature of the task: it involves approaching others, asking for\/collecting \nmoney etc and requires complex social skills and a sense of efficacy as well as a \nwillingness to help. This implies that raffle ticket selling is a poor measure and so our \nanalyses focus on the raffle-ticket buying data. This decision receives support if we \ninvestigate the number who volunteered to sell raffle tickets but who did not offer to buy \ntickets. Out of 88, only 2 fall into this category which suggests that in disregarding the \nselling data we are not overlooking a significant form of helping (for information the \nnumbers falling in the other categories are: neither volunteering to buy nor sell = 18; \noffering to buy but not sell = 45; offering to both buy and sell = 23).  \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTable 1 about here \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Hypothesis testing. \nRaffle-ticket buying. Given the distribution of the raffle ticket buying data we \nsubjected these data to a square root transformation. This resulted in data much more \nsuitable for ANOVA (skewness = .038; kurtosis = -.077). The condition means for the \noriginal and the transformed data are reported in table 1. \nAnalysis of the transformed data in a 2 (meta-stereotype: mean \/na\u00efve) X 2 \n(recipient: in-group\/out-group) ANOVA revealed no main effect of meta-stereotype \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 29 \nsalience, F (1, 84) = 3.38, p = .070, \u03b7p2 =.039, an effect of recipient, F (1, 84) 4.30, p = \n.041 \u03b7p2 = .049, and most importantly, an interaction, F (1, 84) = 4.06, p = .047 \u03b7p2 \n=.046. As expected, the meta-stereotype manipulation did not have an impact when the \nrecipient was in-group (M mean = 2.23, M na\u00efve = 2.29) but did when the recipient was \nout-group (M mean = 3.71, M na\u00efve = 2.31: t (45) = 2.80, p = .007, \u03b72 = .149). Indeed, the \nlevel of helping when the meta-stereotype was salient and the recipient was out-group \nwas higher than that found when the recipient was in-group regardless of meta-stereotype \nsalience (M mean meta-stereotype salient, out-group recipient = 3.71 vs. M mean meta-\nstereotype salient, in-group recipient  = 2.23, t (42) = -2.83, p = .007 \u03b72 = .160; M mean \nmeta-stereotype salient, out-group recipient = 3.71 vs. M mean meta-stereotype non-\nsalient, in-group recipient = 2.29, t (41) = -2.68, p = .011 \u03b72 = .149). \nThese results were also obtained when the original (non-transformed data) are \nanalysed either by ANOVA or non-parametric procedures.2 \nOther measures. The condition means for the auto-stereotype measure (a higher \nscore = more generous) were as follows: M mean meta-stereotype salient, in-group \nrecipient = 5.12 (SD = .65); M mean meta-stereotype salient, out-group recipient = 5.06 \n(SD = .67); M mean meta-stereotype non-salient, in-group recipient = 5.23 (SD = .66); M \nmean meta-stereotype non-salient, out-group recipient = 4.80 (SD = .69). Neither of the \nmain effects for mean meta-stereotype salience or the recipient of helping were \nsignificant, nor was the interaction (respectively: F(1,82 ) = .27, p = .60; F(1,82 ) = 2.99 , \np = .087; F(1,82 ) =  1.66, p =  .202).  \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 30 \n \nDiscussion \nThe results from this Study support both our H2 and H2a. When the mean meta-\nstereotype is salient, participants express higher levels of helping towards out-group \nmembers but not towards in-group members. The finding is all the more powerful \nbecause we are not using estimations of intention to help, but rather what participants \nbelieve to be genuine acts of giving to charity. When we revealed to participants that the \nperson making the charitable appeal was in fact a confederate, there was genuine \nsurprise. Not one person mentioned any doubts over the genuineness of the appeal. \n At first sight there may seem to be an anomaly between studies 2 and 3. In this \nStudy unlike the last, we find no effect of meta-stereotype salience on the Scottish auto-\nstereotype. However, in Study 2, the auto-stereotype is the only tool through which \nparticipants can communicate their helpfulness. In Study 3, participants can demonstrate \ntheir helpfulness much more vividly and directly through acts of giving.  \nWhether this explanation is valid or not, the lack of difference on this measure \nmeans that one cannot put variations in the level of helping down to differences in the \ncontent of the in-group auto-stereotype. Equally, the fact that our revised manipulation of \nmeta-stereotype salience did not produce any differences between conditions in Scottish \nidentification means that the results cannot be put down to levels of identification per se. \nThis leaves an explanation in terms of meta-stereotype salience. It is true that we \nhave no direct measure of this construct and hence no analysis to show that it accounts \nfor the effect of our manipulation on helping. However any direct test of mean meta-\nstereotype salience would create serious problems of reactivity. Getting people to think \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 31 \nand respond explicitly about how the English see them, one would invoke notions of \nmeanness that might not otherwise have come to mind. This is not simply a measurement \nissue. Such a check would undermine the manipulation by rendering salient the Scots \nreputation for meanness in all conditions.  \nOur analysis of the recall items relating to the manipulation shows that \nparticipants could at least access the mean meta-stereotype in the salient condition. \nMoreover, the act of endorsing the mean or penny-pinching terms renders the meta-\nstereotype more salient. While the accessibility of the na\u00efve meta-stereotype in the non-\nsalient conditions does not, in and of itself, show that \u201cmeanness\u201d was not accessible, \nrecent work on retrieval induced forgetting (e.g. MacLeod & Macrae, 2001; Saunders & \nMacLeod, 2002) suggests that the very act of recalling an alternative aspect of the meta-\nstereotype can be expected to inhibit access to the mean meta-stereotype. In other words, \nin measurement terms, the memory findings are consonant with our assumptions about \nsalience and, in process terms, our check serves to strengthen rather than weaken the \nmanipulation. \nHowever, the strength of an explanation in terms of the salience of the mean \nmeta-stereotype lies not only in our ability to measure the construct itself but also in its \ntheoretical ability to account for the pattern of results as a whole. What is particularly \nnoteworthy about these results is not simply the fact that, relatively speaking, the \nmanipulation of meta-stereotype salience affects out-group helping but not in-group \nhelping. Indeed, the absolute level of helping for the out-group in the mean meta-\nstereotype salient condition is higher than for in-group helping in either the mean meta-\nstereotype non-salient or salient conditions. Given that so much of the literature suggests \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 32 \nthat helping depends upon in-group inclusion, the finding that out-group helping can be \nraised so as to surpass in-group helping might seem quite perplexing. But what is \nanomalous in terms of traditional social cognitive explanations makes perfect sense in \nterms of a strategic approach where the issue is what forms of behavior best communicate \nthe desired message to the relevant audience. From this perspective forms of behavior \nwhich one might least expect are the most powerful communicative tools. That is, the \nimprobability of out-group helping is what renders it strategically effective as a means of \ndemonstrating ones helpfulness. So when, because it is made salient that a relevant other \nputs it in doubt, a doubt is cast over in-group generosity, out-group helping is the single \nform of behavior one would expect to be accentuated.  \nThere is one further strand to this argument. It will be recalled from Study 1 that \nthe texts for the meta-stereotype salient and non-salient conditions did not differ in the \nextent to which they were rated as unfair by young Scots nor in the extent to which these \nScots were motivated to refute them. That is, both texts were seen as equally negative and \nthe fact that in Study 3 effects are unique to the meta-stereotype salient condition \nindicates that out-group helping is less a response to negative meta-stereotypes in \ngeneral. It is more a specific act of communication which has potency in refuting the \nspecific accusation of meanness.  \n \nConclusion \nOver three studies we have shown (a) that Scots believe they are seen as mean by \nthe English, that they resent this stereotype, are motivated to refute it and believe out-\ngroup helping is the most effective way of doing so, (b) that increasing the salience of the \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 33 \nmean meta-stereotype leads young Scots to accentuate the extent to which they describe \nScottish people as generous, and (c) that it also leads to helping directed to out-group \nmembers. Our results therefore support our hypotheses, and the notion that people are \nseeking to use helping behaviors as a means of refuting specific negative meta-\nstereotypes provides a compelling explanation of these results.  \nFuture research could usefully extend this thinking. First, it may well be true that \nout-group helping is not used to challenge negative meta-stereotypes in general, but \nrather that the specific meanings associated with this helping are used to refute specific \nout-group stereotypes. However that doesn\u2019t mean that these meanings are only potent in \ndisproving accusations of meanness. Drawing on the Bulgarian example, as outlined in \nthe introduction, out-group helping may also refute (and hence be invoked by) \naccusations that the in-group is uncivilized. Are there other meta-stereotypes which \ninvoke helping and moreover, does the type of accusation also impact on the type of \nhelping offered? For example, it might be that helping the weak and oppressed could be \nespecially important in relation to \u2018uncivilized\u2019 meta-stereotypes. Second, are there limit \nconditions to the impact of a \u2018mean\u2019 meta-stereotype on helping? Is this impact sensitive \nto the extent to which in-group members are visible to the out-group (as we suggest), and \nalso to such factors as the power of the out-group to impose consequences upon the in-\ngroup? Third, while it may well be true that in-group members increase out-group \nhelping to refute the mean meta-stereotype, we could investigate whether this is actually \neffective?  \nHowever, for the present it is appropriate to underline the significance to the \npresent Studies as they stand \u2013 not least that they show how in-group identification is \nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 34 \nlinked to out-group helping. More generally, this work has implications for our \nunderstanding of both the strategic dimension to group processes and the nature of \nhelping behavior. As concerns the former, we provide further evidence for the utility of \nexplanations that imply that some behaviors may be acts of communication intended to \nameliorate the position of the group in an inter-group context. For example, Study 3 \nprovides evidence that phenomena traditionally viewed as being determined by internal \ncognitive representations may be better viewed as strategic acts of communication. \nHelping is not simply an outcome of identity processes, but can be an active intervention \ninto these processes. As concerns the issue of helping there is a simple yet important \nimplication to be drawn. As argued at the outset, it is generally assumed that people who \nhelp must be concerned with the fate of others. Hence what we need to explain is why \npeople should be so concerned. Our work adds to a literature with origins in early \nanthropological investigations which implies that providing for others may reflect \nconcerns over our own collective interests. This work cautions that research into pro-\nsocial behavior must avoid the old fallacy of inferring the motivations of the actor from \nthe observer\u2019s definition of the act. People may be seen to do good to their fellow \ncreatures without having anything remotely God-like about their dispositions.\nThe strategic dimension of pro-social behavior 35 \nFootnotes \n \n1 http:\/\/www.scotweb.co.uk\/underthekilt\/beingmean.html (n.d.) downloaded 21\/6\/06. \n \n2 For information, when the original (non-transformed) raffle-ticket buying data \n(available in table 1) were analyzed in a 2 (meta-stereotype: mean \/na\u00efve) X 2 (recipient: \nin-group\/out-group) ANOVA we found main effects for meta-stereotype salience, F (1, \n84) = 4.15, p = .045, \u03b7p2 =.047, and recipient, F (1, 84) 4.64, p = .034 \u03b7p2 = .052. The \ninteraction was also significant, F (1, 84) = 4.61, p = .035 \u03b7p 2 =.052. As predicted, the \nmeta-stereotype manipulation had no impact when the recipient was in-group (M mean = \n7.67, M na\u00efve = 7.90) but had a clear impact when the recipient was out-group (M mean \n= 16.74, M na\u00efve = 7.92: t (33.07) = 2.81, p = .008). Again, the level of helping when the \nmeta-stereotype was salient and the recipient was out-group (M = 16.74) was higher than \nthat found when the recipient was in-group and the mean meta-stereotype salient (M = \n7.67) t (42) = -2.49, p = .017, or when the recipient was in-group and the mean meta-\nstereotype was non-salient and (M = 7.90), t (33.67) = -2.67, p = .009. \nTo confirm these findings we re-analysed these (non-transformed) data using non-\nparametric tests. A Kruskal-Wallis test across the four cells showed an overall effect of \ncondition (\u03c72 (3) = 11.72, p = .008). Further comparisons (Mann-Whitney) confirmed that \nthe Welsh appeal received more help when the Scots\u2019 reputation for meanness was \nprominent than when it was not (U = 160.0, Z = -2.59, p = .01).
