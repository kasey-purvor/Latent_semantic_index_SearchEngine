Introduction\n[2] The Mangala Valles outflow channel system is located\nin the Memnonia region of Mars, dominated by ancient\nheavily impact-cratered terrain, and extends from its source\ninMangala Fossa, one of themost northerly of theMemnonia\nFossae graben, for at least 800 km [U.S. Geological Survey,\n2003] to the north-northwest (Figure 1). The morphology of\nthe channel system led many workers to conclude that it is\nthe product of one or more episodes of catastrophic water\nflow [Hartmann, 1974; Sharp and Malin, 1975; Chapman\nand Tanaka, 1990; Tanaka and Chapman, 1990]. Ghatan et\nal. [2005] found that the morphology of the channels could\nbe explained by a single flood episode, whereas by consid-\nering the morphology of the source graben, Leask [2005]\nand Leask et al. [2007] have argued specifically for two\nevents. Early work placed the formation of the channels\nwithin the Late Hesperian to Early Amazonian period [Scott\nand Tanaka, 1986] (cited by Tanaka [1986] and Tanaka and\nChapman [1990]). More recent analyses, generally focusing\non the proximal part of the system, by Chapman and\nTanaka [1993], Zimbelman et al. [1994] and Craddock\nand Greeley [1994], as cited by Ghatan et al. [2005], place\nthe flood events within the Amazonian.\n[3] The source of the Mangala Valles channel system is a\ngap in the north wall of Mangala Fossa (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe gap marking the water breakout point is located at the\nlowest part of the north wall of the graben (Figure 4). This\nlocation is the lowest point anywhere on either the north or\nsouth wall of the graben [Ghatan et al., 2005; Leask et al.,\n2007], and it is therefore the natural location for water to\noverflow if the graben had become filled with water. There\nis some evidence for smaller amounts of water-ice overflow\nhaving overtopped the graben in a few other places [Head et\nal., 2004; Leask, 2005; Leask et al., 2007]. A detailed\nmodel of the filling, overflow and erosion process is\npresented by Leask et al. [2007], who argue for the water\nrelease taking place from an underlying, topographically\npressurized aquifer along the boundary faults of the graben.\n[4] Each episode of water release is inferred to have\naccompanied, and continued after, the subsidence of the\ngraben in response to the injection of a dike propagating\nlaterally from the Arsia Mons volcanic system to the east-\nnortheast [Leask, 2005; Leask et al., 2007]. Wilson and\nHead [2002] have summarized theoretical and observational\nevidence for all of the Memnonia Fossae and other graben\nin this region being the result of faulting and subsidence\nresulting from the emplacement of a swarm of giant dikes\nradiating from a mantle magma source beneath Arsia Mons.\nA volcanically induced origin for the graben is supported by\nthe presence of deposits identified with phreato-magmatic\nvolcanic activity at the eastern end of the graben [Wilson\nand Head, 2004]. In this scenario, water is driven to the\nsurface by the topographic gradient within the aquifer\n[Leask et al., 2007], the upper surface of which is assumed\nto mirror closely the surface topography [Clifford, 1993]. In\ncontrast, Hanna and Phillips [2006] suggest that the graben\nfaulting and aquifer pressurization causing water flow may\nhave been due to the release of stresses during the dike-\ninduced tectonism.\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, E08003, doi:10.1029\/2006JE002851, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Planetary Science Research Group, Environmental Science Depart-\nment, Institute of Environmental and Natural Sciences, Lancaster\nUniversity, Lancaster, UK.\n2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, USA.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2006JE002851$09.00\nE08003 1 of 12\n[5] Both mechanisms causing water release produce sim-\nilar initial pressure gradients driving water flow up the fault\nplanes [Leask et al., 2007], but the evolution with time of\nthe pressure gradient, and hence the water discharge rate, is\na matter of debate. If the permeability of the underlying\naquifer is comparable to that of aquifers in basaltic rocks on\nEarth, and does not change as water is released, the\ndischarge decreases roughly exponentially, with a timescale\nthat can be a small as tens of minutes [Carr, 1979; Manga,\n2004; Hanna and Phillips, 2006]. However, Leask et al.\n[2007] argue that, to explain the amounts of erosion in the\nlarger outflow channels on Mars, either discharges of order\n107 m3 s\u00031 must be maintained for times of at least a few\nweeks, or initial discharges must be very much greater than\n\u0001107 m3 s\u00031, an option that would require improbably large\naquifer permeabilities. Additional support for discharges\nbeing maintained at levels of order 107 m3 s\u00031 for much\nof the duration of the water release comes from calculations\nof the changes in water depth, speed and temperature with\ndistance from source on Mars [Bargery and Wilson, 2006]:\nFigure 1. Color-coded MOLA topography of the region containing the Mangala Valles floodplain, the\nMangala Fossa source graben, and the highland topography containing the proposed aquifer system\nfeeding the valley. The region shown extends from the equator to 35\u0001S, and from 200\u0001E to 225\u0001E. Inset\nof Tharsis volcanic area shows location. Box shows location of Figure 2.\nE08003 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALAVALLES, MARS\n2 of 12\nE08003\na water flood would not remain erosional for the entire\n\u0001800 km extent of the channel system at much smaller\ndischarge rates. We therefore support the suggestion of Carr\n[1986] that discharges can be maintained at nearly constant\nlevels for long periods if the aquifer matrix is physically\ndisrupted, with some of the matrix material being elutriated\nby the water flow.\n[6] This paper uses the geometry of the proximal parts of\nthe Mangala Valles channel system to improve previous\nestimates of the water discharge rate through the channels,\nfocusing on how the discharge can be determined from the\ndepth of water in the channels. If the channel system is the\nresult of two or more events, the implication is that we are\nderiving information about the last major event.\n2. Geomorphology of the Channel System\n[7] Figure 5 shows the location of high-resolution images\nof features present within the Mangala Valles that provide\nclear evidence that catastrophic floods have occurred\nthere. These include streamlined islands (Figures 3 and 6),\nterracing (Figures 3, 4, 6, and 7a), chaotic terrain (Figures 3,\n6, 7a, and 7b), moats (Figure 7b), and longitudinal line-\nations (Figures 3, 4, and 7b) [e.g., Komar, 1979; Carr and\nClow, 1981]. Each of these kinds of feature is considered\nbelow using low- and high-resolution MOC images and\nTHEMIS visible images. Transverse dunes are also present\non the floors of some of the channels (Figure 7b). The\nmorphologies of dunes found elsewhere on Mars have been\nused to distinguish between aeolian and fluvial formation\nmechanisms [e.g., Chapman et al., 2003; Burr et al., 2004].\nHowever, we found the morphologies of the dunes on the\nfloors of the Mangala channels to be somewhat ambiguous,\npossibly implying that they were formed by the superposi-\ntion of fluvial and aeolian processes, and so we do not\nconsider them further [Leask, 2005].\n2.1. Streamlined Islands\n[8] Streamlined islands are a very distinctive feature of\nchannels on Mars. Komar [1983, 1984] showed how\nstreamlined islands commonly occur with their narrow ends\npointing down stream, and described how this airfoil shape\nreduces and minimizes the drag which is exerted by fluid\nflow. Komar [1983] indicated that there is a close corre-\nspondence between the airfoil shape of streamlined islands\non Mars and of islands in the Channeled Scablands on\nEarth. These examples provide strong evidence that\nsuch features are indicative of water erosion [Trevena and\nPicard, 1978; Squyres, 1984; Burr et al., 2002a].\n[9] Rice et al. [2002] have suggested that some stream-\nlined islands exhibit depositional rather than erosional bed\nforms, citing Mangala, Ares and Athabasca Valles as\nexamples. Burr et al. [2002a, 2002b] and Burr [2003]\nsuggest that streamlined mesas at Athabasca Valles were\nlargely the result of sediment deposition behind obstacles\nduring fluid flow, followed by partial erosion of the depos-\nited material [Burr, 2005]. Given the possibility that there\nmay have been two flood events in the Mangala Valles\n[Leask et al., 2007], the present morphology of the stream-\nlined islands may be a complex superposition of erosional\nand depositional episodes.\n2.2. Terraces\n[10] The terraces present in Mangala Valles (Figures 3, 4,\n6, and 7a) are similar to those found in other outflow\nchannels on Mars [Baker and Kochel, 1978, 1979; Mars\nChannel Working Group, 1983; Carr, 1986; Chapman and\nScott, 1989; Leask, 2005; Leask et al., 2006a] as well as in\nthe Channeled Scablands on Earth [Baker and Kochel,\n1979] and give some indication of the pattern of erosion\nthat occurred during the flood events [Nummedal et al.,\n1976; Masursky et al., 1977; Leask, 2005; Leask et al.,\n2006a]. Specifically, terraces indicate changing water levels\nduring erosion of the channels. Unfortunately the amount of\nerosion has been so great that it is very hard to establish\nreliable positions of the channel floor in the very early\nstages of flooding from the present topography.\n2.3. Moats\n[11] At Mangala Valles, high-resolution MOC images\nshow the presence of moats (Figure 7b) around island-like\noutcrops of relatively resistant material. Less-resistant\nmaterial surrounding the outcrops has been eroded and\nremoved, and some deposition has occurred on the lee side.\nThe morphology of these features is similar to that seen on\nthe floors of the Grjo\u00b4ta\u00b4 Valles channels, interpreted by Burr\nand Parker [2006] to represent highstanding features first\nembayed by lava flows and then subjected to fluvial\nFigure 2. Low-resolution MOC mosaic of Mangala Valles\nshowing outflow channel radiating from a breach in the\nnorth wall of Mangala Fossa (A). The region shown extends\nfrom 10\u0001S to 20\u0001S, and from 206\u0001E to 213.5\u0001E. Each\ndegree of latitude is \u000159.3 km. Boxes show locations of\nFigures 3, 4, and 6.\nE08003 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALAVALLES, MARS\n3 of 12\nE08003\nerosion. The inference is that the lava is more resistant to\nerosion than the material forming the highstanding features,\nso that they are preferentially removed leaving a depression\nmarking their original extents. If this origin is relevant to the\nMangala Valles features, it is consistent with the interpre-\ntation that there were two flood episodes [Leask et al.,\n2007], lava being emplaced on the first channel floor\nbetween the two events. Whatever the details, we regard\nthese largely erosional features as important qualitative\nindicators of water flow through this area [Leask, 2005],\nbut we have not devised a way of using them quantitatively.\n2.4. Chaotic Terrain\n[12] Chaotic terrain similar to that found elsewhere on\nMars occurs in small amounts within Mangala Valles\n(Figures 3, 7a, and 7b). Some discrete areas of chaotic\nterrain on Mars form the sources of outflow channels and\nthese are probably formed by sudden discharge of water\nfrom beneath the cryosphere, which results in the collapse\nof overlying terrain [Baker and Kochel, 1979; Baker et al.,\n1991; Chapman et al., 2003]. In some cases the trigger for\nthis may be the intrusion of a sill [Leask et al., 2006b]\nwhich applies stresses to the cryosphere rocks and also\nenhances the local heat flow at shallow depth, melting some\nof the cryosphere ice. The combination of these factors\ncauses fracturing of the cryosphere, thus allowing pressur-\nized water to rise into the fractures [Masursky et al., 1977;\nTheilig and Greeley, 1979; Baker et al., 1991; Chapman\nand Tanaka, 2002; Leask, 2005]. In a study of Ravi Vallis,\nColeman [2005] has pointed out that where a channel floor\nis undergoing extensive erosion the removal of some of\nthe overlying cryosphere may itself be enough to allow\npressurized water from a localized aquifer to break through\nto the surface. This may explain of the patches of chaos\nshown in Figure 3. The location of the chaotic terrain will\nthen depend on the strength of the cryosphere materials as\nwell as the presence or absence of available water. Once\nlocalized water breakout of this kind had started, it is\npossible that it continued long after cessation of the water\nsupply from the main source in Mangala Fossa, enlarging\nthe initial area of breakout [Baker and Kochel, 1979;\nSchultz et al., 1982; Laity and Malin, 1985; Kochel and\nPiper, 1986; Chapman and Scott, 1989; Luo et al., 1997].\n2.5. Longitudinal Lineations\n[13] Longitudinal lineations are present in Mangala Valles\nas previously asserted by Sharp and Malin [1975], Carr and\nClow [1981], and Nummedal and Prior [1981]. These\nfeatures (Figures 3, 4, and 7b) show clear evidence that\nFigure 3. THEMIS IR (100 m resolution) image\nI05511003 of Mangala Valles showing the area where there\nis a breach, \u00015 km wide, in the north wall of Mangala\nFossa. Streamlined islands (S), longitudinal lineations (L),\nterracing (T), and chaotic terrain (C) are present down-\nchannel from the breakout point. Note that ejecta (E) from\nthe impact crater on the south side of the graben is present\non both sides of the graben, but is not present on the floor of\nthe graben, suggesting that the crater must be older than the\nlast flood event. Top of dike (D) is located near to the gap.\nNorth is to the top.\nE08003 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALAVALLES, MARS\n4 of 12\nE08003\nthe local bed rock has been eroded. Furthermore, the scour\nmarks on the channel floors in both areas are orientated\nin the direction of fluid flow as indicated by channel\nboundaries [Leask, 2005]. This close and local topographic\ncontrol is in marked contrast to the more uniform and\nslowly changing orientations of lineations caused by aeolian\nprocesses, for example, the yardangs described by Edgett\nand Malin [2000].\n2.6. Implications of Morphology\n[14] The various lines of evidence outlined above lead\nus to conclude that erosion dominated over deposition in\nthe proximal parts of the Mangala Valles channel system.\nWe therefore consider it reasonable to use the present\ntopography of the deepest parts of the channels to infer\nwater flow rates and minimum water volumes involved in\nthe most recent flood event in this area. Topographic\nprofiles were constructed across the channels at 0.1 degree\nintervals between 17.5 and 16.5 degrees south using MOLA\naltimetry data. These are shown in Figure 8a and their\nlocations are indicated on Figure 8b. The profiles clearly\nshow that the floors of the main channels are dissected into\ndeeper subchannels, and a major issue as regards water flow\nthrough the system is whether water was confined to\nindividual subchannels or flooded the main channels to a\ngreat enough depth to interconnect the subchannels. We\nexplore both possibilities in the next section.\n3. Estimation of Water Discharge Rate\n[15] We estimate the volume flux, V, of water though any\none subchannel from\nV \u00bc u d w; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere u is the mean speed of water in the channel, d is the\ndepth of the water and w is the mean width of the channel.\nUnless both banks of a channel are vertical, the mean width\nof a channel with a given cross-sectional profile will depend\non the depth to which it is filled and must be evaluated\nnumerically from the profile. The mean speed of the water is\ngiven by\nu \u00bc 8 d g sina\u00f0 \u00de=f\u00bd \b1=2; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity, 3.72 m s\u00032, a is\nthe slope of the channel bed, and f is the dimensionless\nDarcy-Weisbach bed friction factor, a function of the grain\nsize distribution of the bed material, the water depth and the\nflow regime, specified in equations given by Bathurst\n[1993]. Wilson et al. [2004] used measurements of rock size\ndistributions on the surface of Mars made by Golombek and\nRapp [1997] and Golombek et al. [2003] to implement the\nequations of Bathurst [1993] in a spreadsheet computer\nprogram. Kleinhans [2005] pointed out that Wilson et al.\n[2004] misinterpreted how the rock size distributions were\nspecified by Golombek and Rapp [1997] and Golombek et\nal. [2003], resulting in a \u000110% overestimate in all of the\nflow speeds calculated. We have corrected the computer\nprogram devised by Wilson et al. [2004] to take account of\nthis. We used Wilson et al.\u2019s [2004] equation (15),\napplicable to boulder-dominated channel beds, but corrected\nthe parameter D84, the clast size exceeded by 16% of the\nbed material, from the value 0.164 m originally used by\nWilson et al. [2004] to the value 0.48 m deduced by\nKleinhans [2005]. Note that equation (2) above is applicable\nto turbulent flow, always appropriate for outflow channel\nfloods [Wilson et al., 2004], and does not explicitly involve\nthe fluid density (though there may be second-order effects\nof the fluid density on f). Thus the equation is applicable to\nsediment-laden, as well as sediment-free, water flows as\nlong as the sediment load does not become so large that\nturbulence is damped out or the rheology of the flow\nbecomes non-Newtonian [Bargery et al., 2005]. Thus, given\nmeasurements of water depth, channel floor slope and\nchannel profile, we can calculate discharge.\nFigure 4.

North is to\nthe top.\nE08003 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALAVALLES, MARS\n5 of 12\nE08003\n[16] We showed in Figure 8a how MOLA data can be\nused to derive cross-sectional profiles of subchannels.\nEnlargements of these profiles (e.g., Figure 9) were exam-\nined to determine the number of subchannels in each, and\nthis was found to range from 1 to 6. It was noted that local\nsubchannel depths below the tops of the divides between\nchannels were commonly \u000150 m, implying that a water\ndepth of this magnitude would have corresponded to the\nsubchannels being individually bank-full. We consider it\nunlikely that the water depth was ever very much greater\nthan \u000150 m, otherwise a smaller number of wider sub-\nchannels would have formed, and infer that 150 m is a\nlikely upper limit on water depth. This 50- to 150-m range\nof water depths was therefore used as a starting point for\ncalculating the discharge. The channel system at each cross\nsection in Figure 9 was conceptually flooded with water,\nstarting from each subchannel floor and increasing the water\ndepth in increments of 50 m. Measurement of the horizontal\nchannel width at each increment of depth allowed the mean\nchannel width for any given water depth to be found. The\naverage channel floor slope between any two locations\nalong its path was found by taking the difference between\nthe mean floor levels. The average slope between 16.5\u0001S\nand 17.5\u0001S latitude, a distance of \u000168 km along the average\npath of the channel system, was sin a = 0.002.\n[17] Table 1 shows the results for the channel system at\n16.7 \u0001S, giving the volume fluxes for the individual sub-\nchannels and the total for the cross section. Table 2\nsummarizes the corresponding total fluxes for all of the\n11 cross sections analyzed. Clearly, if the water depth were\nlarge enough to cause the entire channel system to approach\nbank-full, the water volume flux could be inferred to have\nbeen approaching 108 m3 s\u00031. However, erosion must have\nbeen taking place in the channels, and no channel subject to\nerosion can remain bank-full unless the water volume flux\nflowing through it increases with time, an unlikely circum-\nstance for a water flood draining an aquifer system as is\ninferred to be the case here [Tanaka and Chapman, 1990;\nZimbelman et al., 1992; Ghatan et al., 2005; Leask et al.,\n2007]. We take the presence of numerous subchannels with\ndepths commonly of \u000150 m to imply that the water depth\nwas of this order in the region studied for most of the\nduration of the flood, implying that the flux was close to\n1 \u0002 107 m3 s\u00031 for much of the duration.\n[18] If there were no sources or sinks of water in the\nchannel system one would expect the total flux to be the\nsame at all cross sections at any given time, apart from some\nreduction due to infiltration or evaporation from the water\nsurface. Infiltration is likely to be negligible on Mars\ngiven the low surface and shallow subsurface temperatures\n[Clifford and Parker, 2001], but evaporation is relatively\nmuch more important on Mars than on Earth because of the\nlow atmospheric pressure [Wallace and Sagan, 1979]. The\nlikely evaporative reduction in water depth and flow\nconditions over the \u000170 km channel length studied here\ncan be estimated using the mass loss rate of molecules from\nthe water surface, controlled by the temperature-dependent\nvapor pressure of the water.

[2005] and to be described in detail else-\nwhere, requires knowledge of the water temperature on\nrelease from the subsurface which, in a study of the source\ngraben, Leask et al. [2007] show could have been as much\nas \u000140\u0001C. Starting from this temperature, the water would\nhave cooled to 0\u0001C in about 31 min [Bargery et al., 2005].\nFor an initial water depth in the range \u000150 to 100 m and\ntypical flow speed of \u000112.5 m s\u00031 (see Table 1), it would\nhave traveled \u000123 km in this time. By the time the water\nreached the start of the region studied at 17.5\u0001S it would\nhave traveled \u000160 km from the source graben at \u0001 18.5\u0001S\n(see Figure 2) requiring a further \u000149 min, by which time\ncalculations to be described elsewhere show that up to\n\u000128% of the water would have frozen to form ice crystals.\nThe total depth reduction due to water evaporation would\nhave been \u00015.5 m, i.e., about 10% of the typical value. This\nwould have produced about a 5% reduction in velocity and\nhence volume flux, much smaller than any variation that we\nmight be able to detect.\n[19] Table 3 shows the values of the Froude number, Fr,\ndefined by\nFr \u00bc u= gd\u00f0 \u00de1=2; \u00f03\u00de\nfor flow in the channel system between 17.5 and 16.5\u0001S for\nwater depths of \u000150 m (actually close to 51.8 m due to the\nscale of the graphs of the profiles used) and 150 m. The\nvalues lie in the range 0.69 to 0.81 for the local channel\nfloor slope of sin a = 0.002, and in the range 0.44 to 0.52\nfor the regional slope of sin a = 0.00082 between the\nchannel source and 16.5\u0001S. They are all clearly subcritical,\nconfirming that the equations used to specify the flow\nconditions and define the friction factors are valid for the\nflow regime.\n4. Channel Erosion, Water Volume, Flood\nDuration, and Aquifer Geometry\n[20] Using our best estimate of the water depth, Table 2\ngives our average value for the volume flux of water\nflowing through the Mangala channel system during most\nof the duration of its erosion as \u00011 \u0002 107 m3 s\u00031. The total\nvolume of material eroded from the channel system has\nbeen estimated by Hanna and Phillips [2006] as 5700 km3,\na value similar to the \u00015000 km3 estimate of Tanaka and\nChapman [1990]. However, Ghatan et al. [2005] found the\ntotal eroded volume to lie between 13,000 and 20,000 km3.\nWe adopt 10,000 km3 in what follows. Using the suggestion\nof Komar [1980] that the maximum volume fraction of\nsediment that could be carried by a water flood is \u000140%,\nthis implies that the minimum volume of water that must\nhave flowed through the Mangala Valles was \u000115,000 km3.\nAt a discharge of 1 \u0002 107 m3 s\u00031 this would require\n\u000117 days. However, there is no guarantee that the maxi-\nmum possible sediment load was carried. A sediment load\nin of 20% would imply a minimum water volume of\n40,000 km3 and a duration of \u000146 days, and a sediment\nload in of 10% would imply a minimum water volume of\n90,000 km3 and a duration of \u0001104 days. Table 4 summa-\nrizes water volumes and durations for sediment loads\nranging from the \u000140% upper limit down to 5%. It is clear\nthat the required water volume is at least 20,000 km3 and\ncould be as much as 100,000 km3.\n[21] Typical total depths of erosion in the channels in\nthe region studied here (Figure 8) are \u0001200 m. Using this\nvalue and the above duration estimates we give the\ncorresponding erosion rates in Table 4: These range from\n\u00011 to \u000112 m\/day. There have been few attempts to derive\nbed erosion rates for outflow channels on Mars, though\nestimates for a combination of thermal and mechanical\nerosion derived from laboratory experiments of up to\n\u00011 m\/day were given by Costard et al. [1999]. Using a\nmethod similar to that described here, Leask et al. [2006a]\nfound erosion rates for the near-critical to supercritical water\nflood in Ravi Vallis in the range 20 to 100 m\/day, about a\nfactor of 10 greater than the rates found here for the\nMangala Valles.\n[22] The area occupied by the aquifer supplying the water\nthat was released through the Mangala Fossa graben to feed\nthe Mangala Valles can be estimated as follows. Using a\nsimple model of the geothermal heat flow and the Mars\ncrust models of Clifford [1993] and Hanna and Phillips\n[2005], Leask et al. [2007] calculated that the aquifer was\nprobably located at depths between \u00014 and \u000110 km and\nhad a mean porosity of \u00014%. To accommodate the range of\nwater volumes found above,\u000120,000 km3 to\u0001100,000 km3,\nthe required areas are then \u000180,000 to \u0001400,000 km2.\nThere are two options for the location of the aquifer system.\nFigure 9. MOLA topography of subchannels (numbered 1\nto 5) of Mangala Valles at latitude 16.70\u0001S. Each degree of\nlatitude is \u000159.3 km. Where channel bank slopes are fairly\nuniform, water depth increments at \u000150-m intervals are\nshown as dotted lines. In some subchannels, depth\nincrements change so that a water level can be placed at\nany point where a sudden change in channel width occurs.\nWater depths are incremented separately from the bottom of\neach subchannel, and incrementing stops when the level\nwould cause water to spill sideways from any subchannel to\nan adjacent one.\nE08003 LEASK ET AL.: FORMATION OF MANGALAVALLES, MARS\n8 of 12\nE08003\nTable 1.

There is the additional complication that several\nmore graben of the Memnonia and Sirenum Fossae swarms\nrun roughly E-W across this area, and if these are underlain\nby dikes as inferred by Wilson and Head [2002] and Leask\net al. [2007] then, depending on their relative timing, the\nintrusions would have acted as aquicludes segmenting the\naquifer system beneath the valley. We therefore concur with\nearlier suggestions [e.g., Tanaka and Chapman, 1990;\nZimbelman et al., 1992], that the aquifer system extends\nmainly eastward under the flanks of Arsia Mons, where an\nample area and topographic head is available.\n5. Discussion\n[23] We have obtained our flux values by using the\nmorphology to estimate the depth of the water at each of\na series of cross sections through the channel system. A\nmore detailed analysis would model the water flow with an\nenergy surface superimposed onto the digital topography\nand would use continuity of the volume flux as an input to\nsolving the system. However, owing to the nonuniformity\nof MOLA altimetry coverage at the low latitude of the\nMangala Valles we do not consider the present level of\ntopographic detail to be enough to justify this approach. Our\ndischarge estimates are a little greater than those obtained\nby Komar [1979] using earlier Viking data sources for the\nchannel topography and by Ghatan et al. [2005] who based\ntheir analysis on the morphology of a small part of the\nsystem, the notch through which water flowed from the\nsource graben to feed the channels.\n[24] We commented that the amount of evaporation that\nwould have occurred while water was crossing the region\nstudied here would have been relatively small. However, we\nnote that at our estimated flow speeds (Tables 1 and 3) water\nwould have required \u000190 min to travel down the part of the\nchannel system studied, and the conditions in the water\nduring this period would have depended heavily on whether\nthe ice crystals forming in the flow were able to collect at\nthe flow surface to form an ice raft or remained completely\ndispersed throughout the flow. In the former case, the\nsurface of the ice raft would have rapidly cooled to the\nambient atmospheric temperature, greatly inhibiting evapo-\nration [Wallace and Sagan, 1979], heat loss and further ice\nformation; in the latter case, significant additional ice\nformation could have begun to change the rheology of the\nwater and reduce its flow speed, probably changing its\nerosive capability and possibly leading to sediment deposi-\ntion on the floor of the channel [Bargery et al., 2005]. While\nthese issues do not impinge too strongly on the discharge\nestimates for the region studied here, they would become\nprogressively more important for any analysis of the more\ndistal part of the channel system.\n6. Summary\n[25] 1. Of the various features providing evidence of\nwater flow in Mangala Valles, initiated by dike emplace-\nment events forming the Mangala Fossa source, we regard\nstreamlined islands, moats and terraces as unambiguous;\npatches of chaotic terrain and longitudinal lineations as\nsuggestive; but transverse dunes as less convincing.\n[26] 2. The morphology of the floor of Mangala Valles,\nspecifically the presence of subchannels on the main chan-\nnel floor, suggests that the water depth in the channel\nsystem was of order 50 m for most of the duration of the\nerosion event, though initially the channel system may have\nbeen bank-full.\n[27] 3. If the channel system had been bank-full, the\nregional slope of sin a = 0.00082, combined with the water\ndepth, would have led to a discharge of about 108 m3 s\u00031.\n[28] 4. Under what we consider to be the more typical\nflow conditions, the local floor slopes of typically sin a =\n0.002 combined with the \u000150 m water depths imply a\ndischarge of close to 1 \u0002 107 m3 s\u00031.\n[29] 5. The region studied (16.5 to 17.5 \u0001S) is sufficiently\nclose to the water source that changes in flow conditions\ndue to evaporation and freezing of water under Martian\nenvironmental conditions were probably not important.\n[30] 6. The Froude numbers for the flow conditions,\n\u00010.43 to 0.52 for possible early bank-full flow and \u00010.68\nto 0.81 for most of the discharge, were all clearly subcrit-\nical.\n[31] 7. At a discharge of 1 \u0002 107 m3 s\u00031, the \u0001200 m of\nerosion of the channel system would have required 17 days\nif the sediment-carrying capacity of the 15,000 km3 of water\nrequired had been \u000140% by volume; for a 20% sediment\nload the duration would have been \u000146 days and the water\nvolume required would have been \u000140,000 km3. Implied\nbed erosion rates lie in the range \u00011 to \u000112 m\/day.\n[32] Acknowledgments. L. W. and K. L. M. were supported in part\nby PPARC grant PPA\/G\/S\/2000\/00521. K. L.
