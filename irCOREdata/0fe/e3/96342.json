There\nis still no unified theory of rentier states, and the micro-foundations of\nrentier systems in particular have gone largely unexplored.\nAs long as we do not know the mechanisms through which rents are distrib-\nuted, and what kinds of interests and social relationships this process generates,\nit will be difficult to unpack rentier state effects. What is lacking in the current\ndebate, in other words, is a concrete political sociology of rent circulation.\nThis paper proposes a theoretical and empirical micro-basis for rentier-state\nanalysis by examining one core social mechanism characteristic of rentier\nsystems that has hitherto been overlooked: brokerage of state resources\nthrough individuals in privileged positions. I will analyze the particular his-\ntories of brokerage in six oil-rich monarchies of the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil (GCC) as case studies to develop my general argument. While the\nlatter is tentative and calls for future comparative research, my account of\nthe cases is more conclusive and gives us a new handle on the economic soci-\nology of six of the world\u2019s richest rentier systems.\nMy guiding assumption is that rentier states, especially during early resource\nbooms, tend to be characterized by an imbalance of resources between state and\nsociety.

These are provided by\n\u201cbrokers,\u201d intermediaries who hold privileged positions and can make state\nresources available to nationals and foreigners who are not as well connected.\nSuch brokers are a defining feature of state-society relations in rentier states.\nAlthough bureaucratic brokers exist in practically every political system and\nin developing countries with weak administrations in particular, the specific\ncombination of abundant state resources and limited state capacity seems to\nmake them ubiquitous in rentier systems. \u201cBrokerage\u201d captures many of the\ncharacteristics of state-society relations in the Gulf rentiers and is different in\nseveral important ways from conventional, more general arguments about\n\u201crent-seeking,\u201d \u201cclientelism,\u201d and \u201ccorruption.\u201d\nAlthough a strict quantitative proof that brokerage is more prevalent in rentier\nstates is not possible, I do offer a qualitative account of their omnipresence in the\nGulf as well as a number of sector-specific quantitative estimates. As important, I\nrecount how Gulf governments have deliberately created regulations that encou-\nrage the emergence of brokers, and in many cases have made mere citizenship an\nimportant base for brokerage of state resources to non-nationals.\nAfter developing my theoretical argument and linking it to existing literature,\nI analyze a variety of important brokerage positions that are widespread in\nstate-society relations in all GCC countries and provide a general taxonomy.\nI complement this survey with an overview of goods that are typically bro-\nkered. I briefly compare rentier brokerage in the Gulf to brokers in non-rentier\ndeveloping countries, and link my findings, in a more tentative fashion, to the\nbroader debate about the politics of rentier states.\nEmpirical sources for the article include one and a half years of field research\nand participant observation in the Saudi Arabian bureaucracy, and shorter field\nvisits to other GCC states, as well as local press materials and governmental\nand non-governmental reports.1\nA S S UM P T I O N S A N D A RG UM E N T\nThe rentier literature has usually dealt with states and societies in the aggregate\n(Luciani 1990; Anderson 1987; Shambayati 1994; Karl 1997). Alternatively,\nrentier systems have sometimes been analyzed at the level of individuals,\nwith \u201crent-seeking\u201d (Krueger 1974) or, in the fashion of folk psychology, a\n\u201crentier mentality,\u201d posited as a defining feature of the behavior of bureaucrats,\nbusinesspeople and citizens more generally (Beblawi 1987).\nBetween these extremes, there is a large gap in that social structures and\nrelations between political actors on the micro-level have been overlooked. I\n1 I have conducted visits to the region continuously since 2003. My most recent field interviews\nwere conducted in Bahrain in November 2008, in Saudi Arabia in January 2009, and in Kuwait and\nthe UAE in February and March 2009, with businessmen, and current and former bureaucrats.\n2 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n83\n84\n85\n86\nargue here that it is on this level that rentier systems provide the most interest-\ning and distinct empirical material, which allows for the richest theoretical find-\nings. Even if one\u2019s interest is in macro-outcomes, micro-mechanisms will\narguably be needed to explain them: lack of growth, lack of democracy, or low-\nquality institutions\u2014as far as they obtain\u2014will be difficult to comprehend\nwithout an understanding of how rents impact the mundane social behavior\nand state-society interactions that produce these results.\nThis paper treads into largely virgin territory since little has been written on\nthe political sociology of rentier states. My analysis will draw eclectically upon\nconcepts taken from the patron-client literature in anthropology and political\nscience, writings on corruption in economics and political science, and, in\nmore general terms, micro-oriented economic and analytical sociology.\n\u201cBrokers\u201d between bureaucracy and individuals in society have been dis-\ncussed in a few case studies on India (Reddy and Haragopal 1985; Khanna\nand Johnston 2007; Oldenburg 1987; Jeffrey 2002) and are sometimes men-\ntioned in passing in the writing on other developing countries. Although the lit-\nerature on India offers some useful conceptual insights, on which I will draw, it\nis based on micro-case studies of brokers in very specific social and insti-\ntutional contexts. No one has attempted a systematic general survey of broker-\nage roles between state and society, and there is no general model of brokerage.\nThe present article will treat the Gulf states as \u201ccritical cases\u201d on which the\ntheory of brokerage makes particularly strong predictions. My analysis is thus\nexploratory: If brokerage does not occur here, the theory will not hold any-\nwhere. On the other hand, if brokerage indeed is particularly pronounced\nhere, this will allow us to single out and unpack its mechanisms with more\nclarity, laying the groundwork for future comparative research. My findings\non the comparative prevalence of brokerage outside of the Gulf are suggestive\nrather than conclusive, but nonetheless a strong case is made that nowhere does\nbrokerage reach as deeply into the lower rungs of society as in the Gulf.\nDefinitions\nA broker in my understanding is an intermediary between state resources and a\nnon-state party trying to access these resources who is less well connected than\nthe broker is. Brokers can peddle access to state resources\u2014and usually little\nelse\u2014thanks to some kind of privileged position relative to the state. They\nusually do this in return for something from the supplicants who avail themselves\nof their services. This \u201csomething\u201d can take many forms, including a direct\npayment, some other directly reciprocal act, a more diffuse future-oriented obli-\ngation, general loyalty, or signs of deference to the broker\u2019s social status.2\n2 For two useful conceptual discussions of brokerage, see Corra and Willer 2002, who call the\nbroker \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d and Oldenburg 1987. Neither engages with the macro-context I am interested\nin.\nT H E S O C I O L O G Y O F T H E G U L F R E N T I E R S Y S T E M S 3\n87\n88\n89\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n99\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n128\n129\nBrokers are usually individuals. Their brokerage function is often concealed\nbehind a more innocuous outward position: businessman, lawyer, provider of\n\u201ctyping services,\u201d consultant, prince, and bureaucrat are some of the roles\nbehind which a broker can lurk. Brokerage is not necessarily the person\u2019s\nmain vocation; it is a function that many players can perform to various\ndegrees in different social and institutional contexts. Brokers in one context\ncan be supplicants in another. The more complex the system, the more likely\nit is that transactions will involve cascades of brokerage, with several interme-\ndiaries between a good and its recipient.\nBrokers can be office-holders, but do not have to be. Their privileged status\ncan be formal or informal in nature; often it is merely their citizenship. The\nresources they can provide access to include valuable information, state-\nprovided goods and services, and specific bureaucratic acts and decisions.3\nThe latter are generally individual, one-off acts, differentiating brokerage\nfrom political lobbying that is oriented towards more fundamental changes\nof rules and regulations. The more monopolistic a broker\u2019s position is, the\nhigher the value of the access they provide (Corra and Willer 2002).\nConditions for the Emergence of Brokers\nSome authors in the rentier debate argue that large rent inflows accruing to the\nstate tend to give it a particularly large role in politics and economics (Karl\n1997: 59; Ross 2009: 49f.). A natural corollary of this observation would\nseem to be that state resources will also play a larger role in both arenas.\nThis in turn should boost the role of actors who can make these resources avail-\nable. Despite the great importance of brokerage for state power as well as quo-\ntidian social practices in rentier states, this has not yet been clearly spelled out\nin the literature, and the consequences of this causal conjecture for state-society\nrelations have gone unexplored.\nTo be precise, what matters is not so much the absolute size of the state\u2019s\nresources as the ratio of its resources to resources in society: state services\nwill be relatively less valuable and sought after if society has enough pro-\nductive capacity to satisfy individual needs through private provision. Less\nindividual effort will be put into accessing state services and resources. Conver-\nsely, less private wealth and lower productive capacities in society relative to\nthe state will reinforce the reorientation of individuals towards goods provided\nby the state. The ratio of state to societal resources, however, is specifically\nskewed in rentier states.\nThe disproportionate role of state resources in GCC nationals\u2019 lives is\nreflected in state provision of free or subsidized health, education, and utilities.\n3 Even if they might not entail distribution of goods or services with immediate material value,\ninformation and bureaucratic acts tend to be more valuable in the broader context of interaction with\na state that has more resources to distribute.\n4 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n130\n131\n132\n133\n134\n135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140\n141\n142\n143\n144\n145\n146\n147\n148\n149\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n155\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n167\n168\n169\n170\n171\n172\nAs Figure 1 shows, the share of government-final consumption in GDP has his-\ntorically been high in the GCC rentiers. Note that this measure severely under-\nstates the role of the government, since it excludes the oil sector that is largely\nor wholly state-controlled.\nThis is only an aggregate measure of the state\u2019s resources relative to society.\nA more useful way to categorize material resources and productive capacities in\nsociety is in terms of specific economic production factors such as capital,\nhuman resources, and organization. These are distributed unevenly and can\ntherefore be used by specific groups to generate non-state services and\nresources even in the face of a generally dominant state.\nDifferent production factors are present in very different degrees in GCC\nsocieties. While the private sector in the Gulf has by now accumulated large\ncapital resources and has also improved its managerial capacities, enabling\nthe privatization of at least some public service functions, the broader\noutlook on human resources and labor productivity among GCC nationals\nremains rather bleak. Excepting Bahrain, in each country the majority of the\nnational workforce is employed in the overstaffed public sector, compared to\na developing-world average of 6 percent (International Labor Organization\n1994). Expatriates dominate private labor markets in the Gulf, where most\nnationals are unable to compete in either salaries or skills. GCC countries\nrank badly on international benchmarks of educational attainment like the\nTIMSS, PIRLS, and PISA tests.4\nThe dearth of opportunities for gainful and productive employment for semi-\neducated nationals denotes low societal capacities on the individual level of\nmost Gulf citizens. We should expect that this will drive them to seek state\nresources, and to invest in becoming brokers rather than in private activities\nthat generate value-added.\nFIGURE 1 Government Final Consumption as Percentage of GDP.\n4 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, Progress in International Reading Lit-\neracy Study, and Programme for International Student Assessment.\nT H E S O C I O L O G Y O F T H E G U L F R E N T I E R S Y S T E M S 5\n173\n174\n175\n176\n177\n178\n179\n180\n181\n182\n183\n184\n185\n186\n187\n188\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\n196\n197\n198\n199\n200\n201\n202\n203\n204\n205\n206\n207\n208\n209\n210\n211\n212\n213\n214\n215\nA resource imbalance between state and society is a necessary, but not suffi-\ncient condition for brokerage to emerge on a large scale. If a state, however\nrich, delivers all its goods and services swiftly, equitably, and transparently\nto all supplicants, there is little need for intermediation. Brokers can only\nenjoy a privileged position if others are less privileged, that is, if the general\ndegree of state accessibility through non-brokerage channels is relatively low.\nUnresponsiveness and low accessibility of the state through non-\ndiscriminatory, public channels is usually tied to low \u201cunfocalized\u201d (i.e., not\npersonalized) trust between bureaucrats and subjects (Roniger 1990). This\ntends to obtain in the Gulf rentier states, which have been built recently with\nexternal resources, do not look back on a long bureaucratic tradition, and in\nwhich bureaucratic posts are often treated as sinecures. Accessibility is\nfurther limited through fragmentation and over-centralization of decision-\nmaking structures that reduce the formal bureaucracy\u2019s accountability and\nresponsiveness (Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority 2003; Hertog\n2010).\nWhile much of the writing on Gulf and rentier bureaucracies is anecdotal,\nrecent statistical research has found that rent income is indeed a strongly nega-\ntive predictor for the quality of state institutions in a number of categories\n(Isham et al. 2005).5 A simple scatter plot confirms that all six Gulf cases\nperform significantly worse than countries with similar income when assessed\nfor \u201cgovernment effectiveness\u201d (see Figure 3).\nThere is another, subtler observation to be made: although GCC states score\nworse than other rich countries in government effectiveness, they are around or\nabove the global median. That means they are doing better than the great\nmajority of developing countries\u2014a finding impressionistically confirmed by\nmost of my interviewees with experience outside of the Gulf and my own\nfield research non-Gulf Arab countries. What makes richer oil rentier states\nspecial is therefore not a particularly low state capacity by global standards\n(as Chaudhry 1997 seems to argue), but their low state capacity relative to\nthe size of their economy and their resources (as the brokerage argument\nassumes).\nWhat matters for our argument is the relative disparity of state resources and\nstate capacities, and it hence applies even when some of the coarser predictions\nof rentier theory do not obtain. This relative disparity is arguably what makes\nrentier states unique and interesting, but to my knowledge, the consequences of\nthis particular relationship have not been investigated.\nAgainst the background of rich but relatively un-transparent bureaucracies, a\nfinal factor has affected brokerage in the Gulf specifically: brokerage can be\nboosted through formal state acts which explicitly provide privileged access\n5 \u201cLarge-n\u201d studies employ many cases\/observations, and in practice are usually statistical.\n6 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n216\n217\n218\n219\n220\n221\n222\n223\n224\n225\n226\n227\n228\n229\n230\n231\n232\n233\n234\n235\n236\n237\n238\n239\n240\n241\n242\n243\n244\n245\n246\n247\n248\n249\n250\n251\n252\n253\n254\n255\n256\n257\n258\nto state resources for certain strata within a rentier society. Although such acts\nare possible, and do occur, in many other states, it is the specifically high rela-\ntive value of state resources in the Gulf that gives such measures unique impor-\ntance there. All Gulf governments have given local business and nationals in\ngeneral channels of privileged access that have turned large swathes of local\nsociety into part- or full-time brokers of state resources for those lacking\nsuch privilege. This deliberate strategy to channel state resources through\nlocal society has had momentous consequences for social structures in the\nGCC countries.\nTo sum up, the guiding assumptions of this paper are that rentier states are\nsystems that, at least during a crucial formative phase, have resources that\nare (a) disproportionate to the resources available in society, and (b) dispropor-\ntionate to the state\u2019s capacity of administering them and making them available\nin a non-discriminatory fashion. This leads to the emergence of large strata of\n\u201cbrokers\u201d\u2014intermediaries who specialize in making the state\u2019s resources\nFIGURE 2 Share of Public Employment Total Employment of Nationals (2005).

Deliberate state policies creating privileged access for local strata\ncan further boost the phenomenon.\nThe Argument and Existing Approaches: What Is New?\nThe term \u201cbroker\u201d has been used before in the patron-client literature, for\nexample in the shape of the \u201cpatron-broker,\u201d a higher-status individual who\nprovides access to an otherwise inaccessible institution or senior individual\nfor his personal clients (Roniger 1990: 3; Eisenstadt and Roniger 1984; Scott\n1972). The meaning in which I use \u201cbroker\u201d in this paper is considerably\nbroader: Whereas brokers indeed often are personal patrons of the supplicants\nat hand, in many other cases brokers are on the same or even a lower level of\nhierarchy than the supplicant. Moreover, the relationship between broker and\nsupplicant need not be long-term, and need not have the moral or personal\ndimension usually found in patron-client relationships (Eisenstadt and\nRoniger 1984). Finally, conventional patrons tend to have considerable\nresources of their own, whereas brokers focus on mediating state resources\nin a larger institutional context (Scott 1972). This is why the patron-client lit-\nerature is relevant for the present research, but does not allow for direct com-\nparisons, since the categories of actors involved overlap, at best, only partially.\nAlthough this paper draws on insights from the literature on administrative\ncorruption, brokerage is not identical with it, but again broader. The main dis-\ntinction is that brokerage can involve forms of influence peddling that are not\nillegal, which can actually be formally licensed and, in some cases, encouraged\nby governments. Moreover, brokerage does not always involve the exchange of\nmoney for state services\u2014it is often used for \u201csofter\u201d purposes of building\nrelationships. Corruption is clearly present in the Gulf, but it is not clear that\nit is more pervasive there than in other developing countries. What arguably\ndistinguishes the Gulf is the ubiquity of brokerage in general.\nFinally, brokerage is related to, but distinct from \u201crent-seeking\u201d (Krueger\n1974; Khan and Jomo 2000). Rent-seeking in its most basic form simply\ninvolves one actor skimming off resources from another institution or individ-\nual. Brokerage requires at least three parties, rent-seeking only two. Moreover,\nwhile a broker might siphon off resources himself, his main function is to make\nresources available for others, and sometimes brokers get no direct material\nrewards for this. Rent seeking is of course widespread in the Gulf\u2014the scale\nof idle state employment alone is staggering\u2014but its presence as such tells\nus little about the sociology of rent distribution or the structure of state-society\nrelations in a rentier system.\nThe closest existing concept to brokerage is the idea of \u201cwasta,\u201d a term\nwidely used in Arab societies. It stems from the Arabic root for \u201cmiddle\u201d\nand vividly depicts the idea of social intermediation. Having wasta means\nknowing someone who can provide access to something otherwise\n8 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n302\n303\n304\n305\n306\n307\n308\n309\n310\n311\n312\n313\n314\n315\n316\n317\n318\n319\n320\n321\n322\n323\n324\n325\n326\n327\n328\n329\n330\n331\n332\n333\n334\n335\n336\n337\n338\n339\n340\n341\n342\n343\n344\ninaccessible. Bureaucratic and other forms of wasta play an important role in\ndaily life in most Arab countries; it is the stuff of much informal chatter and\nis routinely decried in local editorials. Yet with the exception of one useful\ndescriptive account of the Jordanian case (Cunningham and Sarayra 1993)\nwasta seems to not have been taken up by social scientists. Moreover, wasta\nrelates to informal, personalized influence peddling, whereas brokerage can\nalso be formalized or, even if informal, so anonymous and monetized as to\nlose the personal character of wasta.\nB R O K E R S I N S A U D I A R A B I A A N D T H E G U L F\nGCC states are rich and relatively inaccessible through formal channels, while\nproductive capacities in society are limited. Where, then, are the brokers? The\nshort answer is that they are almost everywhere. The following section will give\na detailed overview of brokerage in GCC state-society relations, from two per-\nspectives. The first is a survey of a number of formal and informal positions\nwhich are defined through brokerage of specific goods. The second is an over-\nview of goods and services that are brokered in more diffuse ways and are less\nneatly tied to specific positions. The latter is complemented by a discussion of\ntwo important general positions\u2014ruling family member and bureaucrat\u2014\nwhich can be used for more diffuse brokerage of a variety of goods.\nIt should be pointed out that mine is a structural political economy account\nrather than a thick ethnography. This is due to the necessarily broad empirical\nscope of the article, and because the different variants of brokerage often have\nlittle in common in terms of the cultural and linguistic concepts involved, since\nthey occur in very different social contexts and on very different levels of hier-\narchy. Brokerage is a crosscutting phenomenon that is defined by important\nstructural commonalities\u2014in terms of the resources involved and the material\npositions of brokers and supplicants relative to the state\u2014rather than by cul-\ntural and discursive ones. It is, in this sense, an external analytical imposition.\nGatekeepers around Senior Regime Players\nThe kind of broker that is perhaps best documented in the Western press and\npopular writing about the region is the gatekeeper around senior regime\nfigures, usually princes and shaikhs. Part of the wider entourage around Gulf\nVIPs, gatekeepers control access to a high-level individual and therefore,\nindirectly, to the resources this individual can dispose of. \u201cGatekeepers\u201d\nexisted already in pre-oil Arabia, but they have gained much in significance\nwith the increasing riches, centralization, and administrative complexity of\nGulf monarchies.\nFamous examples from the 1970s oil boom are Adnan Khashoggi and\nGhaith Pharaon in Saudi Arabia, who acted as go-betweens for such senior\nroyals as Crown Prince (later King) Fahd and Minister of Defense Prince\nSultan. Taking care of the nitty-gritty of large state contracts, they took\nT H E S O C I O L O G Y O F T H E G U L F R E N T I E R S Y S T E M S 9\n345\n346\n347\n348\n349\n350\n351\n352\n353\n354\n355\n356\n357\n358\n359\n360\n361\n362\n363\n364\n365\n366\n367\n368\n369\n370\n371\n372\n373\n374\n375\n376\n377\n378\n379\n380\n381\n382\n383\n384\n385\n386\n387\nnotoriously large cuts,6 providing Western contractors with access to a\ndecision-making system that commanded large resources, but was informal\nand opaque at its core.\nAlthough the most flamboyant gatekeepers of the first oil boom are by and\nlarge gone, the function still exists and is now taken by lower-profile individ-\nuals. The Tuwaijri family around King Abdallah in Saudi Arabia, and the close\nmerchant friends of rulers in the UAE from families such as Tayer, Tajir,\nGhurair, and Gergash fall into this category. So do personal secretaries and\nadvisors and, sometimes, close family members of senior shaikhs such as\nbrothers, wives, cousins, and sons.7 Not all of them monetize the privileged\naccess they can provide, but all can broker large-scale resources for third\nparties. Due to the over-centralization of Gulf government systems and the dis-\ncretionary power of rulers, the information-filtering function that gatekeepers\nundertake is of great importance.\nGatekeepers and senior advisors are generally considered more powerful\nthan other commoners with a formally senior cabinet post, whose function is\nmore technocratic.8 They have historically often come from non-tribal (\u201ckhad-\nhiri\u201d or \u201cbayasir\u201d) backgrounds, and as such have no status group to fall back\non. Together with the \u201ccontract brokerage\u201d described below, gate keeping is the\nform of brokerage that has imparted the highest social mobility. Id bin Salem\nrose from being a simple car mechanic to become keeper of the privy purse\nand lead advisor under King Saud in 1950s Saudi Arabia. The Darwish\nfamily, of humble non-Arab background, worked its way up to leading advi-\nsory positions at the court of the Al-Thani rulers in Qatar, acting as go-betweens\nfor foreign companies.9 Although gate keeping usually implies complete\ndependence on the patron, the links involved are often \u201csticky\u201d and stable\nover generations and can lead to the cooptation of gatekeepers\u2019 families into\nthe national notability.\nMany ruling family members also maintain a traditional court structure\naround themselves, which can include manumitted slaves and their descen-\ndants, other servants, and \u201clittle brothers\u201d (\u201ckhuwayy\u201d), scions of servant\nfamilies with whom a prince or shaikh was brought up. The aggregate size\nof these courts is large\u2014in Saudi Arabia they count tens or even hundreds\nof thousands of individuals10\u2014and court positions are frequently used to\nprovide access to a ruling family member. This can be used to guarantee\n6 Field 1984; phone interview with a former U.S. Aramco functionary, Jan. 2007.\n7 TheMail on Sunday (6 May 2006) documents how King Fahd\u2019s secret Lebanese wife acted as\na broker for friends and relatives to get them visas, jobs, and other perks through her access to Fahd.\n8 Various interviews.\n9 The Royal Cabinet, 24 Aug. 1960, Mulligan Papers, Special Collections Division, Lauinger\nLibrary, Georgetown University, box 3, folder 61; Field 1984.\n10 Interviews with senior advisors to the Saudi government, 2004\u20132007.\n10 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n388\n389\n390\n391\n392\n393\n394\n395\n396\n397\n398\n399\n400\n401\n402\n403\n404\n405\n406\n407\n408\n409\n410\n411\n412\n413\n414\n415\n416\n417\n418\n419\n420\n421\n422\n423\n424\n425\n426\n427\n428\n429\n430\nlegal protection, influence administrative decisions and contract awards, or\nprovide access to state services on behalf of a supplicant.\nSeveral factors combine to give the access-brokers around regime decision-\nmakers inordinate influence and a widespread presence: the resources at stake,\nthe informal and opaque nature of the regime cores in all Gulf states, the large\nnumber of ruling family members (between a couple of hundred and many\nthousands) and the weakness or absence of more formal mechanisms to\naccess the elite.\nMucaqqibs: Paper Pushers around the Bureaucracy\nThe gatekeeper has a more mundane cousin, familiar from other developing\ncountries: the petty administrative paper pusher who uses his inside knowledge\nand contacts in a bureaucracy to help applications along that would otherwise\nbecome stuck. In the Gulf, these individuals are sometimes known as mucaq-\nqibs (derived from to the Arabic verb for \u201cto pursue\u201d).\nDue to the much larger size of bureaucracies and budgets in the Gulf, the\nnumber of these individuals is probably greater there than in most non-rentier\ncases. Again, the combination of large state resources with relative bureaucratic\nimpenetrability creates demand for brokers. This is not to say that some parts of\nGulf administrations are not working rather well and operating on clear formal\nrules, after four decades of oil-funded development. Yet, the most efficient parts\nof Gulf states are usually not in charge of large-scale interactions with citizens\nand business; instead, the most prominent \u201cislands of efficiency\u201d tend to be\ninsulated bodies like central banks, national oil companies, or utility regulators\n(Hertog 2007; 2010). Service-oriented line ministries such as commerce, labor,\neducation, or health are often still slow and opaque by rich-country standards,\nand hence they nurture legions of paper pushers.\nMucaqqibs are often lower-class nationals, frequently of non-tribal back-\nground, and sometimes expatriates who have invested time in establishing net-\nworks in such government agencies that they use to expedite paperwork for less\npatient or well-connected customers. Although less glamorous than even the\nlowest-profile senior gatekeepers, they sometimes are under the patronage of\n(usually lower-tier) ruling family members, whose names they can deploy to\nspeed up procedures.11 Mucaqqibs closer to senior positions have in the past\nworked their way up to become full-blown gatekeepers to senior decision-\nmakers, usually on the basis of luck and persistence rather than education.\nMore often, however, their unglamorous work around the lower rungs of\nlarge bureaucracies does not lend itself to easy social climbing.\n11 One taxi driver taking me from Riyadh airport to the city in 2004, for example, earned extra\nincome by chasing documents in the notoriously opaque Saudi Ministry of Interior by virtue of a\nprince\u2019s patronage, about whose generosity he seemed genuinely enthusiastic.\nT H E S O C I O L O G Y O F T H E G U L F R E N T I E R S Y S T E M S 11\n431\n432\n433\n434\n435\n436\n437\n438\n439\n440\n441\n442\n443\n444\n445\n446\n447\n448\n449\n450\n451\n452\n453\n454\n455\n456\n457\n458\n459\n460\n461\n462\n463\n464\n465\n466\n467\n468\n469\n470\n471\n472\n473\nPaper pushers often run small \u201ctyping offices\u201d in front of administrative\nbuildings, and some of them also act as consultants or lawyers.12 They seem\nto be particularly ubiquitous in front of large passport and labor agencies and\ncustoms offices.13 Different services come at different prices, and the better-\nconnected touts can also deliver services which are technically illegal, such\nas coming up with \u201cmissing\u201d documents and getting them accepted (such as\nvisa transfers of foreign workers, see below). Scarce coupons and documents\nare sometimes leaked from the administration and traded informally.14 It is\nusually obvious to all parties involved, including the bureaucrats, that certain\nprocedures are illegal; how spoils are divided tends to be the secret of the\ntout. Crackdowns against paper pushers are rare and usually half-hearted.15\nIn some cases, such as in the UAE, \u201ctyping offices\u201d are formally regulated,\nand in the emirate of Ras Al-Khaimah they are now even allowed to conduct\nofficial licensing procedures.16\nLarger private companies usually keep their own \u201cgovernment relations\u201d\nstaff, which specializes in getting access to government agencies, sometimes\ncooperating with and sometimes supplanting independent paper pushers.17 A\nEuropean company I was associated with employed a non-Gulf Arab for just\nthis purpose on an impressive salary. He had little education and no grasp of\nthe company\u2019s business, but an amazing facility in establishing contacts and\ngetting paperwork done; it was generally recognized that he was taking his\nshare, too. In the UAE, the job of government relations officer has recently\nbeen restricted to Emirati nationals. Saudi Arabia has officially restricted all\nmucaqqib jobs to Saudis (Economic Studies House 2002).\nContract Brokers\nA less petty variant of the administrative intermediary is the contract broker.\nThis role entails the peddling of exclusive information, and of bureaucratic\ndecisions over government contracts. This function is usually performed by\nwell-connected local companies (sometimes under shaikhly control) toward\neither foreign or less-connected local companies. The contract broker function\ncan overlap with that of the gatekeeper, as in the Khashoggi and Pharaon\nexamples, or that of Wafic Said in the more recent Yamamah defense procure-\nment affair, who has acted as private advisor for sons of the Saudi defense\n12 Arab News, 15 June 2005; Khaleej Times, 20 June 2005, and 15 July 2006.

Here too, the modal pattern is one of creating access to large state\nresources in an otherwise impenetrable environment. Contract brokerage can\nalso lead to rapid social ascendancy, though much less so today than during\nthe 1970s boom period, when many of these links were first established.\nContract brokers can act either as joint-venture partners or simply as repre-\nsentative \u201cagents\u201d for foreign companies, working for a fee that often depends\non the size of awards.18 In still other cases, businesses winning contracts simply\nsub-contract most of the work for smaller fees, limiting their own role to that of\nrent-seeking intermediary. The infrastructure of many companies during the\nfirst oil boom was limited to a desk, a telephone, and a fax machine.19\nClosely related to contract brokerage was the introduction of \u201ccommercial\nagency\u201d regulations in the 1960s, which forced foreign companies to sell\nFIGURE 4 The Mucaqqib.

Although agents could be established commercialists with a serious\ndistribution infrastructure, others, notably ruling family members, contracted\nout little more than their name. Compulsory agency rules were generally intro-\nduced when oil income took off, as were ceilings on foreign direct investment,\nforcing foreigners into joint ventures with locals.20 Many large Gulf family\ncompanies got their first break as commercial agents, including Juffali for Mer-\ncedes in Saudi Arabia, and Ghanim and Mannai for General Motors in Kuwait\nand Qatar, respectively. Rulers would on occasion award agencies as personal\nrewards.\nDuring the 1970s boom, any local could in principle act as intermediary for\nforeign enterprises, resulting in what Chaudhry with only slight hyperbole\ncalled a \u201cwhole society of commission entrepreneurs\u201d in the Saudi case\n(1997: 153). Hundreds of thousands of small-scale national contracting and\ntrading enterprises were registered in the 1970s and 1980s. In Saudi Arabia,\nthe number of registered companies increased from 77,304 in 1975 to\n144,436 in 1980, and reached more than 200,000 by 1985.21\nTenders for state contracts usually needed to be submitted through locals in\nall GCC states, and were preferentially given to nationals,22 who were often\nincapable of fulfilling them on their own. Relationships between contracting\nagencies, contractors, and sub-contractors frequently were highly personalized\n(Moon 1986). Even in cases when brokerage was not objectively necessary,\ncontract brokers tended to plant rumors that they needed to be paid a commis-\nsion for specific projects to move ahead, browbeating companies into cutting\nthem in.23\nMuch of the apparently unproductive \u201cleakage\u201d of resources that resulted\nwas arguably part of regimes\u2019 deliberate distributional policy: having local\ncompanies share in the oil wealth without creating formal distributional obli-\ngations, and channeling capital their way, even if it could not be immediately\nput to productive use. This intentional, and formalized, creation of brokerage\nseems to differentiate the \u201cleakage\u201d in rentier states from that in other develop-\ning countries (Reddy and Haragopal 1985) and, together with the larger size of\nstate resources, contributes to its larger scope. By giving a special value to\nrentier state citizenship per se, Gulf governments created traditions of broker-\nage that have defined GCC business and state-society relations until today.\n20 Based on a survey of Arab Law Quarterly, MEED archives; U.S. Trade Representative Reports\n(http:\/\/www.ustr.gov\/about-us\/press-office\/reports-and-publications\/2009\/2009-national-trade-estimate-\nreport-foreign-trad); and GCC ministry of commerce websites.\n21 Saudi Arabia 1985.\n22 Montagu 1994: 65.\n23 U.S. National Archive and Records Administration, College Park, Maryland, Record Group\n59, box 1793, folders DEF 12-5 SAUD, and DEF 6-4 SAUD.\n14 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n560\n561\n562\n563\n564\n565\n566\n567\n568\n569\n570\n571\n572\n573\n574\n575\n576\n577\n578\n579\n580\n581\n582\n583\n584\n585\n586\n587\n588\n589\n590\n591\n592\n593\n594\n595\n596\n597\n598\n599\n600\n601\n602\nLocal business in the Gulf states have been playing a much more serious role\nin contracting during the recent oil boom. Although commission entrepreneurs\nare still around, it has generally become much harder to get a contract just on\nthe basis of personal connections and without demonstrated project management\ncapacities. Although many businessmen got their first break as mere contract\nbrokers, the bust of the 1980s has separated wheat from chaff, favoring the sur-\nvival of the more productive ones, and forcing companies to find private, more\ndemanding clients (Vasiliev 2000: 454; Luciani 2005). Similarly, many commer-\ncial agents, even if most of them have kept their national privileges and brand\nmonopolies, have built up a well-developed distribution infrastructure.\nYet, there remain cases of full-blown businesses that specialize most of all in\npaving the administrative path for foreign companies in return for being taken\non as joint venture partners. Such businesses have often built up a close\nrelationship to specific government agencies issuing contracts that allow\nthem to gather insider information or influence tender specifications.\nContract brokerage within ruling families might have been curtailed, but it cer-\ntainly has not stopped. Allegations sometimes make it into the Western press, as\nis the case with former Saudi Ambassador to the United States Prince Bandar and\nformer Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa. The current Qatari and Bahraini prime\nministers also have a reputation for contract brokerage.\nToday, the most important field for unreconstructed brokerage of state assets\nis probably not government projects but rather the sale and resale of\ngovernment-owned land.24 Because it does not directly drain the state\nbudget, it is easier to conceal; due to continuing population growth it functions\nas a self-replenishing source of rents. The modal pattern seems to be the follow-\ning: Ruling family members receive land as a grant from the ruler or through\ntheir personal control of a government agency. They resell it in turn to\ntrusted real estate brokers with whom they have a long-term relationship.\nThese then parcel the land out into smaller bits that can be resold to other\nplayers on the real estate market (and are often resold again, making for\nlarge cascades of brokerage).25 At every stage, a more privileged player sells\nto a relatively less plugged-in actor and large profits are made. In some\ncases, governments buy back land, converting land handouts to more or less\ndirect fiscal handouts.26\nThe value of land can be strongly influenced through zoning and infrastruc-\nture decisions which more senior players often have influence over. The values\ninvolved can be gigantic. \u201cConstruction\u201d and \u201cownership of dwellings\u201d con-\ntributes between 10.6 and 22.7 percent of GCC non-oil GDPs, and most of\n24 Interviews with real estate brokers, lawyers, and businessmen in Saudi Arabia, 2004\u20132006;\nField 1984: 99f.\n25 Interview with a former senior Saudi bureaucrat, May 2004.\n26 Tetreault 2000; Naqeeb 1990.\nT H E S O C I O L O G Y O F T H E G U L F R E N T I E R S Y S T E M S 15\n603\n604\n605\n606\n607\n608\n609\n610\n611\n612\n613\n614\n615\n616\n617\n618\n619\n620\n621\n622\n623\n624\n625\n626\n627\n628\n629\n630\n631\n632\n633\n634\n635\n636\n637\n638\n639\n640\n641\n642\n643\n644\n645\nthe land involved has at some point passed through regime hands.27 In Saudi\nArabia, most of Riyadh\u2019s land seems to have passed at some point through\nthe hands of either Prince Sultan or Prince Mishcal, often to be resold by little-\nknown but very rich broker families like Musa or Sweidan.28 In Bahrain, real\nestate politics are highly charged since most of the island\u2019s territory is owned\nand resold by royals. (Some 90 percent of the coastal lands are supposedly con-\ntrolled by members of the Al-Khalifa, as Bahraini oppositionists have recently\ntried to demonstrate with the help of Google Earth.29) Not coincidentally,\ncadastral administrations are among the least developed branches of govern-\nment in the Gulf countries.30\nBrokers in the Trade in Labor\nReal estate brokerage is important in terms of value, but the number of privi-\nleged actors involved is relatively limited. Possibly the largest market for\nbrokers in terms of their sheer numbers is that of trade in visas and expatriate\nlabor. About a third of the GCC\u2019s total population, or some twelve to fifteen\nmillion people, are expatriates, and they dominate private labor markets.\nWith the renewed oil-driven construction boom since 2004, millions of new\nwork visas have been issued annually.\nSupply of foreign labor however is tightly regulated in theory, restricted pri-\nmarily to the businesses that receive a permission to \u201cimport\u201d foreign laborers\nthrough government-granted visas. The formal domestic labor market for expatri-\nates is rigid, since they cannot switch to another employer (or \u201csponsor\u201d) without\nthe acquiescence of the present one, and in some cases not at all (Hertog 2006;\n2010). Most sponsorship rules were first introduced with the oil boom in the\n1960s, Kuwait being the last to impose them in 1982 (Atiyyah 1990).\nThe large demand for foreign labor in the Gulf oil economies combines with\nweak labor administrations to create an inordinate number of brokerage opportu-\nnities that allow businesses to skirt national quota and sponsorship rules. The main\nmechanism for making the formally rigid labor market supple, and profiting from\ndiscriminatory access to the labor bureaucracy, is that of the \u201cfree visa\u201d market.\nThe basic mechanism is that a sponsor acquires more labor permits from the\ngovernment than they actually need, usually through a combination of inaccurate\ndocumentation and privileged access to the bureaucracy. The laborers that are\nimported on this basis are then resold on an informal market to other employers\nwho are actually in need of labor but could not acquire it due to their worse access\nto the labor bureaucracy. Many of the better-connected sponsors conversely own\n27 Calculations based on Gulf Investment Corporation 2006.\n28 Interview with Saudi real estate investors, Jan. 2007.\n29 Discussions with Bahraini businessmen; and Ogle Earth, Bahrain in Google Earth.

Many free visa workers,\nhowever, especially domestic helpers, are directly imported by petty broker-\nsponsors. By one estimate, 95 percent of Indian maids come to Kuwait illeg-\nally,33 most of them through small-time sponsors. In the UAE, employees of\nthe Ministry of Labor are known to issue visas illegally against bribes,34 and\nhave themselves registered letterbox companies to import workers. In the\nsummer of 2005 they were rather generously allowed to transfer company\nregistrations to relatives in cases where they had more than ten establishments\nregistered.35 In March 2004, I spoke to a Saudi contractor with three hundred\nemployees of whom he had not imported a single one himself.\nThe direct service that sponsor-brokers receive from the state is only an\nallowance to import labor, and no direct distribution of material benefits is\ninvolved. Visas are of obvious material value, however, which has to do\nwith the high demand for foreign labor that in turn is caused by the GCC\ncountries\u2019 rentier nature: local riches increase the demand for labor in (often\nstate-driven) services and construction, while the relative paucity of productive\ncapacities among nationals limits the supply of local human resources.\nSponsors often use their position to extract additional rents. Labor traders\ncan skim off up to 80 percent of the salaries of the labor they sponsor.36\nMany sponsors also demand money for visa cancellations when workers\nwant to return home, and ask for extortionate sums if workers want to officially\ntransfer their sponsorship to their real employer. During autumn 2007 amnes-\nties for illegal laborers in the UAE and Bahrain, many sponsors refused to\nreturn passports to workers unless they paid them back a year\u2019s wage or\nmore.37 Language barriers, fear of detection, and low levels of education\namong many expatriate workers increase their helplessness and dependency\non sponsors. Foreign workers are often intimidated into dealing only with\ntheir sponsors even if they in fact have the right to engage with the labor admin-\nistration directly, for example in the course of labor market amnesties.\n31 Some 70 percent of construction companies in Bahrain are estimated to be \u201cghost companies\u201d;\nBahrain Tribune, 20 Feb. 2008.

The Bahraini govern-\nment gave a cautious estimate of forty thousand out of three hundred thousand\nprivate workers in 2005. According to Bahrain\u2019s minister of labor, some nine\nthousand unemployed Bahrainis have been using commercial registrations to\nimport expatriate labor for prompt resale.38 A Bahraini labor inspection cam-\npaign in 2008 showed that of 6,277 establishments visited only 3,644 were\nactually active in business.39\nThe UAE in 2004 was estimated to harbor six hundred thousand free visa\nworkers, more than a quarter of the total workforce.40 A 2008 press estimate\nof free visa workers in Kuwait is eight hundred thousand, out of a total work-\nforce of about two million.41 In 2004, the new Saudi minister of labor claimed\nthat 70 percent of the work visas issued by the government were sold on the\nblack market.42\nIf on the basis of the above figures we cautiously assume a share of free visa\nworkers in the total Gulf labor force of one third, this would make for more than\nfour million of them. Presuming that the ratio of free visa sponsors to free visa\nworkers in the whole region is similar to the one observed in Bahrain, we would\nhave about a million free visa sponsors, or more than all privately employed\nGulf nationals in 2005. It is hard to think of another country with such a\nhigh share of access brokers (of only one type!) relative to productively\nemployed citizens. The estimates are of course rough, but the order of magni-\ntude quite likely is right.\nThe scale of income from free visa brokerage is even harder to estimate, but\nindividual prices alone\u2014which are better documented\u2014are staggering. GCC\nworkers are reported to pay between US$800 and $8,000 to their sponsors\nfor a visa; the most frequently quoted figures fall between $2,000 and\n$4,000.43 They are also reported to pay similar amounts for officially shifting\ntheir registration to a different sponsor.44 This compares to a monthly income of\nmany expatriate workers in the Gulf of barely more than $150. The annual fees\nfree visa workers often have to pay to their sponsors range from $1,000 to\n$3,500, according to a Kuwaiti estimate.45\nIf we presume that of the four million estimated free visa workers an annual\nsix hundred thousand are replaced, and that the average free visa price is $2,500\n(both low estimates), this would make for a total GCC-wide free visa income of\n38 Gulf Daily News, 13 Nov. 2005.

Our estimates are on the low side: according to one Kuwaiti civil\nsociety activist, the free visa market is worth $3 billion annually in Kuwait\nalone,47 about 5 percent of the country\u2019s non-oil GDP. Whatever the exact\nfigure, the visa brokerage market has a considerable volume.\nPeddling Citizenship to Foreigners for Business: \u201cCover-up\u201d Companies\nFree visa trade is based on two forms of unequal access to the bureaucracy: The\nfirst is access enjoyed by specific individuals who have either cultivated links in\nthe labor bureaucracy or who by virtue of their senior position can extract visas\nmore easily. The second, especially in the pettier variant of visa trade, is more\ngeneral access that is simply based on the privilege of being a rentier state\nnational, as exemplified by the scores of unemployed Bahrainis moonlighting\nas sponsors.\nAn even more brazen version of such \u201crenting out\u201d of citizenship is that of\nthe \u201ccover-up\u201d businesses (\u201ctasattur\u201d in Arabic, from \u201cto be veiled or covered\nup\u201d). These are enterprises, usually small, in sectors that are off-limits to\nforeigners, and therefore are formally registered under the name of a national\nbut are in fact owned and run by an expatriate.48 They include small-scale res-\ntaurants, grocery stores, service companies, and workshops\u2014that is, most of\nthe hundreds of thousands of small enterprises clustered throughout the\nGCC\u2019s cities. Once more, it was usually boom-time decrees from the 1960s\nonward that limited small-business ownership to locals.\nThe large scale of the phenomenon again reflects the low productive\ncapacities in local societies relative to the resources and demand at hand. As\nin the visa trade, the players involved are both senior actors who operate on\nthe bulk level and use their privileged access to have dozens or hundreds of\ncompanies registered under their name,49 and small-time brokers who might\nsell their name for only one establishment. Many of the latter are reportedly\nuneducated and jobless, and see the sale of their citizenship privileges as the\nonly readily available income. \u201cSaudis engaged in cover up either have protec-\ntion or have nothing to lose.\u201d50\n\u201cCover-up\u201d practices are illegal.

Again, the estimate is\nrough, but the sheer order of magnitude is impressive.\nMonthly cover-up fees can lie between one hundred and several thousand\ndollars per month, depending on the scale of the business.55 If we presume\n$300 as the average monthly charge, then three hundred thousand cover-up\nbusinesses would yield an annual income of more than a billion dollars\nGCC-wide. Nationals can extract further ill-gotten gains from cover-ups\nthrough the expropriation and expulsion of the informal owners.\nCover-ups apparently exist at the highest levels: in spring 2009, an Iranian\nbusinessman sued Dubai ruling family member Hasher Maktoum bin Jumaa\nal-Maktoum for US$1.9 billion, claiming that he was the actual owner of a\nreal estate company registered under the shaikh\u2019s name in 2004.56 In\nKuwaiti, the national \u201cowners\u201d of cover-up companies are sometimes brazen\nenough to apply for state grants reserved for innovative small and medium pro-\njects run by nationals.57\nThere are further, more diffuse forms of peddling citizenship as channel of\naccess to the state. During the pre-2006 Gulf stock boom, for example,\nnationals acted as informal stock brokers for foreigners in several countries,\nbuying and keeping stocks on their behalf in return for a fee.58 Similarly,\nnationals have used their citizenship privileges to enable foreigners to invest\nin local property markets which are officially off-limits to them,59 and are illeg-\nally sub-letting subsidized property.60\n51 Arab News, 14 Mar. 2006.\n52 Riyadh Daily, 19 June 2003.\n53 Some 90 percent of the 542,000 companies registered with the Ministry of Commerce in 2002\nwere small enterprises, the majority of which are probably cover-ups.

They are however widespread in all\nGCC rentier states and, not coincidentally, were mostly created when oil\nincome started to rise. They seem to reflect a redistributive strategy that\navoids creating direct material entitlements that could be claimed from the\nstate, yet allows nationals to profit from the boom. Although other developing\ncountries can in principle also embark on such strategies, privileging nationals\nis more affordable and much more rewarding when foreigners are keen to work\nin and trade with a country due to its rentier riches. Brokerage opportunities can\ncome at a cost to productive endeavor, however. As one interviewee put it:\n\u201cBeing a Saudi is worth money, and this can sap incentives.\u201d61\nFigure 5 summarizes the main forms of brokerage discussed so far, and\nshows that it exists on all social levels, can be dependent on specific personal\naccess or be generalized to the citizenry at large, and can, but does not have to,\ndraw on formal regulatory privileges.\nGoods Diffusely Brokered\nThe article has thus far looked at specific functional positions of brokerage tied\nto the intermediation of specific state-provided goods. Such mechanisms are the\neasiest to delimit and their scale is easiest to estimate, relatively speaking.\nThere are however also state resources that can be diffusely brokered\nthrough a multitude of social and organizational positions, and conversely\nthere are positions which allow their occupants brokerage of a multitude of\ndifferent goods through a variety of channels. It is often in these types of\nexchange that relationships are more diffuse, longer-term, and less monetized.\nIn this regard, they are closer to conventional patron-client relationships, yet\nthey do not necessarily involve the hierarchical relationships that characterize\nthe latter.\nDiffusely brokered goods and multifunctional brokerage positions are too\namorphous to be comprehensively documented and categorized, let alone\nmeasured with any degree of precision. Field research in the Gulf shows that\nthey are pervasive, however, not least due to the extensive scope of state ser-\nvices. I will first discuss goods, then positions.\nTo be sure, certain public services are delivered relatively smoothly in the\nGulf; provision of and access to basic healthcare and basic education, while\noften brokered goods in the past, nowadays tend to be much better. While\ngetting water and electricity connections can still be difficult, privatization\nand competition have strongly reduced the importance of wasta in telecoms ser-\nvices, too. Even if some basic provisions are de facto guaranteed, however,\nGulf states aim to offer an extensive range of free or subsidized services\n61 Interview with a senior Saudi bureaucrat, Jan. 2007.\nT H E S O C I O L O G Y O F T H E G U L F R E N T I E R S Y S T E M S 21\n861\n862\n863\n864\n865\n866\n867\n868\n869\n870\n871\n872\n873\n874\n875\n876\n877\n878\n879\n880\n881\n882\n883\n884\n885\n886\n887\n888\n889\n890\n891\n892\n893\n894\n895\n896\n897\n898\n899\n900\n901\n902\n903\nabove and beyond the basic level. This ambition allows for extensive brokerage\nof higher-quality services.\nMost health services are still provided publicly in the Gulf, and coverage in\nprinciple is comprehensive. Different from developing countries, the scope of\nservices is rather large, and in contrast with most developed countries, service\nprovision is largely free, at least in theory. In fact, however, hospital resources\nare often stretched, quality is mixed, and health administrations are opaque and\nsometimes corrupt. To receive anything above basic care through formal chan-\nnels can be difficult.\nState-provided health services therefore are an important brokerage resource\nthat can be relayed through a variety of actors: ruling family members, senior\nbureaucrats, or simply friends and relatives with better personal links to specific\nhealth institutions (Shah et al. 1996; interviews). Government payments for\ntreatment abroad are brokered particularly frequently.62\nThe situation in education, higher education in particular, is similar. Much of\nit is still state-provided, access in principle is universal but in fact can depend\non one\u2019s connections because admission bureaucracies are often opaque and\nthere are no meaningful appeals mechanisms. Scholarships for study in the\nWest or access to prestigious degree programs at home can depend on wasta,\non intermediaries with privileged access.63\nFinally, government jobs and promotions are an important resource in\nbrokerage games. Although some smaller elite sections of Gulf bureaucracies\nare reasonably meritocratic, others are staffed with much \u201cdeadwood,\u201d a\nFIGURE 5 Types of Access Brokers in the Gulf.\n62 Interviews with Saudi and Kuwaiti citizens, businessmen, and bureaucrats, some of whom\nwere active in the health sector), 2004\u20132009; Kuwait Times, 11 Nov. 2007; Arab News, 11 Nov.\n2008.\n63 Arab News, 16 Sept. 2007, and 10 Aug. 2008.\n22 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n904\n905\n906\n907\n908\n909\n910\n911\n912\n913\n914\n915\n916\n917\n918\n919\n920\n921\n922\n923\n924\n925\n926\n927\n928\n929\n930\n931\n932\n933\n934\n935\n936\n937\n938\n939\n940\n941\n942\n943\n944\n945\n946\ngood share of which result from appointments that have been arranged through\nbrokers.64 These brokers are usually senior figures in the regime, often ruling\nfamily members. Because the civil service plays an inordinately large role in\nthe labor market for nationals who lack competitiveness in the private\nmarket, hoping for the right wasta can be a rational strategy.\nThe public services outlined above can be accessed through brokers of\nvarious kinds. Conversely, certain social and organizational positions lend\nthemselves to brokerage of more than one good. The most important multifunc-\ntional brokers are bureaucrats and members of ruling families, followed by\nother members of the social elite such as merchants and notables.\nBureaucrats are involved in day-to-day management of state resources, and\nthere are more of them relative to the total national working population than\npretty much anywhere else. The scope bureaucrats have for brokerage activities\ndepends upon the resources they have at hand as well as their personal discre-\ntion over them, which tends to be closely related to the inaccessibility of their\nparticular bureaucratic agency. Not all bureaucrats act as brokers, but many do,\nif only out of obligation to friends and family. Although the average bureaucrat\nprobably practices less corruption and favoritism than in other developing\ncountries, the overall number of bureaucrats and resources available is much\nhigher. Even if only half as many GCC bureaucrats exert brokerage functions,\ntheir much higher share in national employment (more than half as opposed to 6\npercent in the developing world at large) would create a much larger volume of\nbrokerage.\nThe lower the position of a bureaucrat, the more limited is the range of\nresources he can usually make available, be it services of immediate monetary\nvalue (contracts, subsidies, health and education services, etc.), or decisions of\nindirect material utility (licenses, certificates, information).65 Complaints about\nministerial wasta are often heard in the Gulf, but it is often the only way to get\nsomething done.66\nMembers of the large ruling families are the arch-brokers in the GCC mon-\narchies, since they have the most immediate discretionary control over state\nresources. Again, the more senior a player is, the wider the array of services\nhe can make available. Lower-level ruling family members, however, also\nhave more multi-functional roles because their social status crosscuts adminis-\ntrative boundaries.\nRuling family members are very active in free visa markets, in certain sectors\nof state contracting, and in the resale of government-owned land. They are\n64 Arab News, 12 Sept. 2007, and 16 Sept. 2007; Arab Times, 19 Sept. 2005; Kuwait Times, 28\nAug. 2008.

With\na highly centralized formal bureaucracy\u2014to the extent that the cabinet some-\ntimes has to decide on individual license applications\u2014informal access\nthrough senior figures comes at a premium.\nIn addition to bureaucrats and shaikhs, there are many other individuals with\ndiffuse, if comparatively less important brokerage roles. Large merchants or\nnotables often have privileged access to the state. In Kuwait, members of par-\nliament can be important brokers. Parliamentary pork for voters exists in many\nsystems, but Kuwait\u2019s legislature has a whole squad of \u201cservice\u201d MPs who do\nlittle else but make state resources such as jobs or health treatment available to\nindividual constituency members (Tetreault 2000).67 In all GCC states wasta is\nalso acted out more diffusely through links of tribal identity, kinship, friend-\nship, or shared regional background among individuals with differential\naccess, which can but need not involve hierarchical relationships.\nBrokerage and Its Social Context\nAll forms of brokerage discussed thus far, whether regulation-based or infor-\nmal, specific or diffuse, have one thing in common: an individual in a privi-\nleged position makes state resources of some kind available to other\nindividuals lacking access. The phenomenon is particularly pronounced in\nthe Gulf because the state has large resources relative to society and is compara-\ntively inaccessible. Just as important, governments have formally restricted\naccess to the state over the course of the oil boom, creating opportunities for\nbrokerage on a scale unthinkable in non-rentier systems.\nRegimes had a clear motivation for this: in the face of limited local skills,\ncreating formal privilege was an effective way of cutting locals in on the\nboom economy. At the same time, national privileges have created new\nsocial boundaries, as citizenship has become more valuable and the social\ndifference between locals and foreigners more pronounced. Policies of national\nprivilege have helped to rear a local private sector, but they have also created\nnew dependent strata of rent- and access-peddlers, creating vested interests in\nstructures that are inefficient in the long run.\nIn some cases, such as that of gatekeepers, brokerage still comes with \u201cthick\u201d\ncultural baggage, while in others, such as the free visa trade, it has become little\nmore than a market transaction based on formal privilege. So far as brokerage\ninvolves informal, personalized links, it is often equated with wasta in local\n67 See also Gulf States Newsletter 784, 23 June 2006: 8f.\n24 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n990\n991\n992\n993\n994\n995\n996\n997\n998\n999\n1000\n1001\n1002\n1003\n1004\n1005\n1006\n1007\n1008\n1009\n1010\n1011\n1012\n1013\n1014\n1015\n1016\n1017\n1018\n1019\n1020\n1021\n1022\n1023\n1024\n1025\n1026\n1027\n1028\n1029\n1030\n1031\n1032\nsociety, a concept whose generic connotation is negative (Hutchings and Weir\n2006). However, as is the case with corruption in other contexts (see Jeffrey\n2002), actors often denounce the wasta used by others, but happily and even\nproudly resort to it in their own context. With the increasing complexity of\nstate and society, wasta now involves not only kinship links but also friends,\ncolleagues, and acquaintances.68\nThe growth of both population and state apparatuses has increased pressures\ntoward anonymization and marketization of brokerage. They have also created\ncascades of brokers on several levels. A lowly mucaqqib can act as a broker to a\nmid-level bureaucrat, who in turn might enjoy the patronage of a deputy min-\nister who allows him to make state resources available and who himself might\nbe under the patronage of a ruling family member. In many cases it is no longer\nnecessary for supplicants to become personally involved with higher-level\nactors. In some sectors, such as contracting and land trade, state-provided\ngoods get parceled out into smaller bits as they move down a brokerage\ncascade.\nSome of the structural effects of brokerage on state and society at large are\nclear, while others require more discussion. Among the obvious effects is the\nsapping of productive incentives for nationals, a frequent gripe of liberal\nGulf technocrats complaining about free visa or cover-up activities. Brokerage\nopportunities increase reservation wages and deepen the division between\nnationals and expatriates.\nBrokerage also tends to undermine the coherence of policy implementation.\nLabor reforms in several countries have been stymied through the free visa\ntrade, and the effect of recent investment liberalization policies has been\nlimited in several cases through the de facto need for foreign investors to get a\nlocal partner to push papers. In Saudi Arabia, a new \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for\nforeign investors has in fact led to the emergence of new brokers offering invest-\nment licenses to circumvent mandatory minimum capital requirements.69\nLess clear is the impact of brokerage on domestic class formation. On one\nhand, during the boom era domestic merchant classes were economically\nboosted through contracting and agency rules. On the other, the process has\ncreated individualized dependence on the state, depriving them of much of\ntheir status as \u201cclass for itself.\u201d Merchants\u2019 families remain important, but\nunlike the past they now tend to lobby the rulers individually.\nOther forms of brokerage such as free visa and cover-up have arguably ham-\npered the emergence of national labor and professional classes with clear econ-\nomic interests. Needless to say, these strata of brokers remain atomized\nthemselves\u2014there is no organized lobby, whether directly or by proxy, of\nfree visa or tasattur interests.\n68 For a similar processes in (poorer) Jordan, compare Cunningham and Sarayra 1993: 2, 14f.\n69 Hertog 2010: 168\u201382.\nT H E S O C I O L O G Y O F T H E G U L F R E N T I E R S Y S T E M S 25\n1033\n1034\n1035\n1036\n1037\n1038\n1039\n1040\n1041\n1042\n1043\n1044\n1045\n1046\n1047\n1048\n1049\n1050\n1051\n1052\n1053\n1054\n1055\n1056\n1057\n1058\n1059\n1060\n1061\n1062\n1063\n1064\n1065\n1066\n1067\n1068\n1069\n1070\n1071\n1072\n1073\n1074\n1075\nNone of this is to deny that on the individual level certain social groups have\nprofited more than others from some types of brokerage: Urban strata have dis-\nproportionately benefited from bureaucratic employment and contacts with the\nstate apparatus, perhaps comparable to the petty \u201cintermediate classes\u201d in India\nthat have capitalized strongly on access to the expanding bureaucracy there\n(Jeffrey 2002; Harriss-White 2003).\nThere has also been a diffuse trickle-through and trickle-up of tribal and\nregional identities into informal networks of brokerage in Gulf bureaucracy\nand business, resulting, for example, in an unusually high number of Saudis\nfrom the country\u2019s central region in privileged positions. However, this\nprocess has developed mostly as a result of rulers\u2019 top-down decisions. Bureau-\ncratic brokers might represent their region, clan, or family individually, but\nthere are few cases of collective \u201ccapture\u201d of state agencies by larger groups,\nsuch as we know from African or Asian cases (see Bayart 1979; Szeftel\n2000; Jeffrey 2002; Khan and Jomo 2000). The only exception seems to be\nKuwait, where ideological movements such as the Salafists and Muslim Broth-\ners have managed to gain control over specific public enterprises in the hydro-\ncarbons sector thanks to a much stronger tradition of organized politics. But\ntheir class basis remains diffuse.\nIn general, and in contrast with the Indian case (see Jeffrey 2000), bureau-\ncratic recruitment and mobility in the Gulf are tightly controlled by a small\ncentral elite and are difficult to manipulate locally. Contingency and elite\nchoices played a large role in who emerged on top in the course of the boom\nand, as we saw, previously marginal actors sometimes found themselves in\nhighly privileged positions. And despite a pro-urban bias, thanks to relatively\nsmall populations most social strata have had a shot at obtaining at least some\nkind of state employment. Forms of brokerage based on mere citizenship status\nhave provided further opportunities for marginal groups. The system in this\nsense has not been as effectively or exclusively used to reproduce class or\nstatus group privileges as the Indian one (Gupta 1995; Jeffrey 2002).\nThat said, the types of brokerage widely available to marginal groups usually\nimply much lower chances of social mobility. Gatekeeping and business inter-\nmediation have led to stellar careers when linked with the right patron-client\nnetwork. The brokerage involved in most forms of paper pushing, or the anon-\nymous brokerage that merely draws on an individual\u2019s formal status as national,\nis much less likely to transform the broker\u2019s status.\nB R O K E R A G E I N C OM PA R I S O N\nThe GCC countries seem suffused with brokerage. The striking similarities of\nscale and scope of outcomes in the six different cases allows us to control for a\nnumber of factors in explaining the phenomenon. Higher levels of political par-\nticipation in Kuwait as such do not seem to lead to less brokerage: although the\nparliament creates tighter checks on the ruling family\u2019s business involvement, it\n26 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n1076\n1077\n1078\n1079\n1080\n1081\n1082\n1083\n1084\n1085\n1086\n1087\n1088\n1089\n1090\n1091\n1092\n1093\n1094\n1095\n1096\n1097\n1098\n1099\n1100\n1101\n1102\n1103\n1104\n1105\n1106\n1107\n1108\n1109\n1110\n1111\n1112\n1113\n1114\n1115\n1116\n1117\n1118\nfunctions at the same time as a defender of citizen privileges and as a major\nchannel of brokerage itself. Size of country does not seem to have much influ-\nence on brokerage levels, nor do levels of ethnic and sectarian heterogeneity or\nthe (absence of) colonial experience, nor the timing of state formation or of\n\u201cfirst oil.\u201d\nIt is hard to fathom intra-GCC differences in their respective levels of broker-\nage. Anecdotally, it appears that brokerage is less pronounced in Bahrain and\nOman, as one would expect for two systems with relatively higher levels of\nstate accessibility and a less skewed relationship of state and societal resources.\nBrokerage in terms of free visa trade and cover-up businesses seems to involve\na higher share of nationals in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Kuwait, the countries with\nthe highest state resources per capita70 and the lowest participation of nationals\non private labor markets.71 The more fundamental and definitive finding\nhowever is that all of the GCC cases evince high levels of brokerage, as our\nargument would lead us to expect in broader comparative context.\nA brief diachronic comparison further confirms our suspicion that the ratio of\nstate to societal resources, combined with levels of state accessibility, influ-\nences levels of brokerage. Due to lack of detailed data, these comparisons\nmust remain suggestive rather than definitive.\nI have mentioned that brokerage has decreased in a few bureaucratic fields\nthat have been professionalized or privatized. More interestingly, it seem to\nbe exactly the strata of society that have deepened their own resources that\nnowadays rely less on brokerage: Although many Gulf businessmen were\nlittle more than commission entrepreneurs in the 1970s, those among them\nwho survived the bust of the 1980s have generally increased their managerial\ncapacities dramatically and have learned to cater to private demand rather\nthan relying exclusively on fluctuating state contracts.72 Their share in GDP\nand, even more so, national capital formation, has increased strongly.\nGiven its higher capacities, we should expect business to put less effort into\nmaking money through sheer brokerage. This prediction is borne out by a prima\nfacie comparison between the 1970s boom and the current one. Although the\nvolume of public projects is back to the heights of the last boom, there is\nmuch less raw contract brokerage this time around, as local businesses are\ninstead competing for state deals through offering substantial services.73 The\nnew boom has not led to a reemergence of the hundreds of thousands of letter-\nbox contracting companies known from the 1980s.\n70 Interviews with businessmen and chamber of commerce representatives in the UAE and\nKuwait, Feb. and Mar. 2009.\n71 Only an estimated 1.5 percent of the UAE\u2019s private sector workforce are Emirati.

Below the highest level,\nlocal businesses are still largely staffed with expatriates, and most nationals\nremain uncompetitive on the private labor market. We should therefore\nexpect that incentives to invest effort into becoming a broker have not\ndecreased significantly. This indeed seems to be the case: free visa brokerage\nhas recently been somewhat reduced through government crackdowns and\namnesties, but the system remains entrenched. The same is true of cover-up\nbusinesses. Neither, outside of a few streamlined agencies, has there been\nany discernible change in paper pushing or brokerage of state services\nthrough bureaucrats and ruling family members; interviewees report that\nthere has been little change since the 1970s in the importance of shaikhly\npatronage in the administration.\nRuling family members as well as cover-up and free visa brokers find it more\ndifficult to evolve into a productive role in the way contracting businesses have,\nwhile bureaucratic salaries in the GCC have hardly kept up with inflation and\nimportant parts of Gulf administrations remain rather opaque. For all of these\nactors, relative incentives for seeking brokerage roles have changed less than\nthey have for business actors.\nState access is never perfectly equitable or free of effort, and brokers between\nstate and society exist all over the world. To my knowledge, there are no other\nsystem-wide studies of their scope and scale of the sort I have attempted here.\nNevertheless, by comparing our account with the more fragmented evidence\nfrom the literature we can sharpen our understanding of the phenomenon\u2019s\nrange and its underlying mechanisms.\nThe literature contains references to \u201cgatekeepers\u201d or their equivalents in\ncentralized and unaccountable systems in very different times and places, be\nit King Mohammad VI\u2019s Morocco (Denoeux 2000), Suharto\u2019s Indonesia,74\nPeter the Great\u2019s Russia (Zitser 2005), or Louis XIV\u2019s France (Kettering\n1988). Although the only detailed accounts I have found focus on rural India\n(Reddy and Haragopal 1985; Oldenburg 1987; Jeffrey 2000), paper pushers\nvery likely exist in many places.75 Cases of contract brokerage are documented\nfor large parts of the developing world (and certainly are not absent in the\ndeveloped world).76 The diffuse brokerage function of bureaucrats qua corrup-\ntion and patronage is also documented for many cases (Bayart 1993; Le Vine\n1975; Szeftel 1982; 2000; Robertson-Snape 1999: 594f.; Waterbury 1973:\n74 Robertson-Snape 1999; New York Times, 22 May 1998; Time Magazine, 8 July 2002.\n75 When traveling by car from Saudi Arabia to Turkey in 2004, I encountered them around the\ncustoms offices at every land border I crossed.\n76 Well-documented cases include Morocco and Indonesia. Waterbury 1973; Robertson-Snape\n1999.\n28 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n1162\n1163\n1164\n1165\n1166\n1167\n1168\n1169\n1170\n1171\n1172\n1173\n1174\n1175\n1176\n1177\n1178\n1179\n1180\n1181\n1182\n1183\n1184\n1185\n1186\n1187\n1188\n1189\n1190\n1191\n1192\n1193\n1194\n1195\n1196\n1197\n1198\n1199\n1200\n1201\n1202\n1203\n1204\n547f.; Wade 1982: 314ff.; Ledeneva 2006; 2008; Harris-White 2003: 79\u201381;\nJeffrey 2002).\nThe literature is heterogeneous and does not usually focus on brokerage (or\nrentier states) per se, but certain themes do recur. The rise of the state and its\nresources encourages brokerage, as do opacity and high centralization of the\nadministration. Privileged access is the main basis for the activities of\nbrokers, who can have a vested interest in making the bureaucracy appear as\nless transparent and more arbitrary than it in fact is.\nThe corruption and favoritism described in the literature are often more\nbrazen and wide-reaching than in the Gulf, as are the obligations office-holders\nhave to their friends and kin (Szeftel 2000; Bayart 1979). Nowhere in the lit-\nerature, however, is a stratum of brokers mentioned that approaches the scale\nof what I have described for the GCC. This is no surprise, since none of the\ndeveloping world cases involve such large budgets and state apparatuses, or\ngovernments providing as many goods in daily life as do those in the GCC.\nThe best-documented case study of pervasive bureaucratic brokerage prob-\nably is Robert Wade\u2019s detailed investigation of the irrigation bureaucracy in\na Southern Indian region (1982). Irrigation bureaucrats act as brokers of state-\nprovided resources and services vis-a`-vis peasants and public works contrac-\ntors, using lower-level administrators as go-betweens. Despite pervasive cor-\nruption that allows mid- and higher-level officials to augment their income\nmany times above their official salary, Wade estimates the direct financial\ncosts of brokerage as rather low for peasants (about 1\u20135 percent of their\nprofits). This apparent discrepancy can only be explained by the limited\nnumber of brokers relative to the population at large.\nA similar, if less detailed account of the manipulation of land records by local\nbureaucrats in India mentions an average of two officials per village, a far cry\nfrom the omnipresent bureaucracy in the Gulf (Gupta 1995: 379). In his field\nresearch on rural elites in Uttar Pradesh, Craig Jeffrey found three to four\nmiddle-caste individuals acting as informal brokers to the local administration\nin each of three settlements that contained between 4,000 and 10,000 inhabi-\ntants (2000: 1029). This is about one broker per thousand villagers in the\nsmaller settlements, while in our Gulf free visa estimate, for example, we\narrive at one free visa broker per twenty Gulf nationals. In Sarayra and Cun-\nningham\u2019s 1993 book on wasta in Jordan, those providing access to the state\nalso seem to be a relatively few senior individuals serving larger communities.\nEven if developing country systems are more corrupt and impenetrable than\nthose in the Gulf\u2014as seems the case in the Indian examples\u2014they seem to\nprovide space for fewer brokers than in the GCC countries. This is not to\ndeny that bureaucratic access in poorer countries can be as vital as in the\nGulf, but there is a quantitative difference in that most GCC citizen have to\ndeal with their bureaucracy much more frequently than does the average\nIndian peasant.\nT H E S O C I O L O G Y O F T H E G U L F R E N T I E R S Y S T E M S 29\n1205\n1206\n1207\n1208\n1209\n1210\n1211\n1212\n1213\n1214\n1215\n1216\n1217\n1218\n1219\n1220\n1221\n1222\n1223\n1224\n1225\n1226\n1227\n1228\n1229\n1230\n1231\n1232\n1233\n1234\n1235\n1236\n1237\n1238\n1239\n1240\n1241\n1242\n1243\n1244\n1245\n1246\n1247\nFurther evidence for the wider presence of brokers among Gulf citizens is\nthat many of them are lower-class individuals, who seem to predominate in par-\nticular lines of brokerage, such as paper pushing. In India, by contrast, few individ-\nuals below the country\u2019s \u201cintermediate classes\u201d (Harriss-White 2003; Jeffrey 2000)\nmanage to carve out brokerage positions.77 In the literature on Africa, too, broker-\nage seems to mostly involve privileged strata (Bayart 1993; Le Vine 1975;\nSzeftel 1982; 2000).\nIn addition to the putative quantitative differences, there are also qualitative\ndifferences between brokerage in the Gulf and elsewhere. The non-Gulf litera-\nture holds no examples of individuals brokering their status as nationals\nthrough mechanisms such as trade in free visa or cover-up business licenses.\nRentier citizenship seems to impart unique opportunities in this regard.\nRentier resources have allowed the GCC states to engage in a special redistri-\nbutive strategy in which citizenship plays a pivotal role, and can itself become a\nbrokered good, as has happened for example in Kuwaiti and Bahrain. Some\nKuwaiti nationals reportedly offer to register expatriate Arabs\u2019 children as\ntheir own for a fee of $35,000 to $70,000.78\nConversely, there are forms of brokerage in the wider world that are absent or\nonly marginally present in the GCC. Brokerage of state resources through pol-\nitical machines, parties, and career political bosses, known from the United\nStates, India, Africa, and Latin America (Jeffrey 2002; Johnston 1979;\nSchmitt 1974; Lemarchand 1972; Wantchekon 2003; Van de Walle 2003;\nSzeftel 2000; Fox 1994) is absent in the Gulf with the partial exception of\nthe Kuwaiti parliament.\nSome developing countries such as Indonesia also have seen the sale of\noffices through senior bureaucrats (Kristiansen and Ramli 2006), and in\nIndia there are shadow markets in government jobs that exclude specific\nsocial strata (Jeffrey 2000). Such phenomena are hardly known in the more dis-\ncreet Gulf, where jobs are rather used as tokens of soft, personalized patronage\ncontrolled by high-level figures. Bureaucracies in the Gulf are comparatively\nmore institutionalized and contain fewer full-scale \u201cprebends\u201d (Van de Walle\n2003) below the highest level. Although bureaucratic posts can be given as a\nreward, the intended enrichment tends to take place through salaries rather\nthan through \u201cplanned corruption.\u201d\nIn general, in the GCC distributional brokerage seems to be stronger than the\nextortionate corruption familiar from developing countries, where supplicants\nengage in an exchange not to receive a service of material value, but simply\n77 Although the intermediate classes are \u201cnumerically vast\u201d (Harriss-White 2003: 48), they con-\nstitute a minority.\n78 Kuwait Times, 4 Jan. 2009. Nigeria, another, much poorer oil state has also seen the emer-\ngence of \u201ccover-up\u201d businesses in its private sector after the formal nationalization of small and\nmedium enterprises during the 1970s oil boom decade (Lewis 2007: 138).\n30 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n1248\n1249\n1250\n1251\n1252\n1253\n1254\n1255\n1256\n1257\n1258\n1259\n1260\n1261\n1262\n1263\n1264\n1265\n1266\n1267\n1268\n1269\n1270\n1271\n1272\n1273\n1274\n1275\n1276\n1277\n1278\n1279\n1280\n1281\n1282\n1283\n1284\n1285\n1286\n1287\n1288\n1289\n1290\nfor the privilege of being left alone by the state, be it the police, tax authorities,\nor health and safety inspectors (Bayart 1993; Jeffrey 2000).\nC O N C L U S I O N\nIn this paper I have developed a simple model to explain why \u201cbrokers\u201d of state\nresources emerge, and I have presented evidence of brokerage in the GCC\ncountries across sectors and over time. I have also briefly compared brokerage\nin the Gulf with some of the available fragmentary evidence from other cases.\nThese comparisons have pointed to further sub-types of brokerage outside of\nthe GCC, but they also seem to show underlying causes for brokerage to be\nthe same, regardless of the social level or level of formality it is embedded in.\nBrokerage emerges due to both structural causes\u2014low state capacity and\nlarge state resources\u2014and specific government policies of creating national pri-\nvileges and formal exclusion. The latter however will only induce large-scale\nbrokerage if the former conditions are fulfilled. Therefore, large-scale,\nstate-induced brokerage is hard to conceive of outside of rentier states. In con-\ntrast to the general rentier debate, my argument focuses on relative rather than\nabsolute weakness of state institutions, and on the state\u2019s resources relative to\nsociety rather than its absolute resources.\nAlthough brokerage is universal, the Gulf rentier states seem to be unique in\ntwo regards. First, brokers appear to be more prevalent in the Gulf than in any\nnon-rentier state\u2014hundreds of thousands of them among relatively small\nnational populations of several millions. Second, the GCC cases exhibit\nsome sub-types of the phenomenon that seem to be unique, among them free\nvisa traders and cover-up businesses. These are linked to the extensive use of\nrentier citizenship as a brokerage resource and, in parts, to the encouragement\nof brokerage by the state at different points in history through policies of\nnational privilege. In no other system in the world, it seems, is citizenship\nsuch a prized and fungible economic resource.\nThe ubiquity of brokerage has important consequences for economic incen-\ntives in society, for social stratification, and for state-society relations. It can\nmake the state more accessible, but also creates great inequalities in access\nand deadweight losses, and it can undermine the coherence of the adminis-\ntration. Moreover, once a brokerage role has been established, it creates\nvested interests that endure beyond the time when it might have served a\nuseful purpose. Cover-up businesses and free visa trade are notoriously difficult\nto eradicate side effects of a protectionist policy that has outlived its usefulness\nas device for creating a national business class.\nPolitics of Brokerage\nBrokers are a large \u201cinterest group\u201d that has been left out of the literature on the\npolitics of development (Oldenburg 1987: 533). One reason they have been\noverlooked might be that they are such a heterogeneous group, with little in\nT H E S O C I O L O G Y O F T H E G U L F R E N T I E R S Y S T E M S 31\n1291\n1292\n1293\n1294\n1295\n1296\n1297\n1298\n1299\n1300\n1301\n1302\n1303\n1304\n1305\n1306\n1307\n1308\n1309\n1310\n1311\n1312\n1313\n1314\n1315\n1316\n1317\n1318\n1319\n1320\n1321\n1322\n1323\n1324\n1325\n1326\n1327\n1328\n1329\n1330\n1331\n1332\n1333\ncommon and interests that are usually local and highly specific. Moreover, in\nthe GCC many forms of brokerage are part-time occupations at best, acted\nout in specific social and institutional contexts that constitute just a small\npart of the broker\u2019s life.\nOnly some sub-classes of brokers have collective political agency: ruling\nfamilies and, sometimes, sections of business. Contractors and commercial\nagents in the Gulf have repeatedly managed to stymie official attempts at redu-\ncing their national privileges (Chaudhry 1997; Hertog 2010). Beyond this role\nof veto player, they have not pursued their collective interests as brokers sys-\ntematically. Small-time brokers such as mucaqqibs, lower-level courtiers, or\ncover-up business \u201cowners\u201d have almost no collective agency.\nAs I have argued, brokerage in the GCC context is, if anything, likely to\nundermine class formation and collective action. Brokerage interests are indi-\nvidualized, often personalized, informal and local in nature. As far as they\nare tied up with illegal activities, political lobbying on their behalf is a risky\nundertaking. Many brokers moreover are in hierarchical relationship to state\nagents in a highly centralized and authoritarian system. In many regards indi-\nvidual brokerage substitutes for collective interest representation (Khanna and\nJohnston 2007), and some authors have linked the emergence of brokerage to a\nweakness of the public sphere (Reddy and Haragopal 1985). With the exception\nof Kuwait, GCC states score very badly on measures of voice and accountabil-\nity, making individual and informal as opposed to collective and formal access\nto the state the preferred choice of most nationals.\nAltogether, the tradition of accessing the state through brokers has probably\nled to atomization of state-society relations. Though brokerage can also occur\namong peers, it tends to be enmeshed in vertical structures of authority and\ndependence which are, in the final analysis, linked to the regime elite. This\nworks against horizontal interest representation. There seems to be a political\nlogic in this: Gulf ruling families have discouraged or sanctioned collective\naction in their societies while encouraging nationals to present petitions to\npursue their individual interests on a case-by-case basis, which can result in\ngenerous payoffs.79\nBrokerage opportunities as well as many of the brokered goods can be\ngranted by the regime, but do not usually constitute a formal entitlement.\nThey can therefore be taken away more easily, also on a case-to-case basis,\nwhich makes them a suppler instrument of patronage. Their removal is a\npotent threat, especially if they involve illegal transactions. Competition for\nindividual spoils and privileged access can fragment and de-politicize\nelites.80 Brokerage in this context may help to explain the persistence of\n79 Interviews with Saudi businessmen and government advisors in Riyadh, 2003\u20132007.\n80 On such political uses of \u201cplanned corruption,\u201d see Waterbury 1973.\n32 S T E F F E N H E R T O G\n1334\n1335\n1336\n1337\n1338\n1339\n1340\n1341\n1342\n1343\n1344\n1345\n1346\n1347\n1348\n1349\n1350\n1351\n1352\n1353\n1354\n1355\n1356\n1357\n1358\n1359\n1360\n1361\n1362\n1363\n1364\n1365\n1366\n1367\n1368\n1369\n1370\n1371\n1372\n1373\n1374\n1375\n1376\nauthoritarianism in Gulf rentier states. While brokerage creates economic costs,\nit also has political uses.\nGiven the important political consequences of brokerage structures, their\nsecular decline in the Gulf, at least relative to the last boom, is politically sig-\nnificant. With increasing nationalization of private labor markets, progressive\nliberalization of business regulations, and, in some areas at least, maturation\nof the bureaucracy, levels of brokerage are bound to decline. Due to inter-\nnational pressures, some states are now even mooting an abolition of the spon-\nsorship system, which would put an end to the free visa system it its current\nform.\nDiscretionary spending of rulers and some other core areas of brokerage\nhowever are likely to remain untouchable for many years. It is no accident\nthat almost all economic sectors have been opened for foreign investment in\nSaudi Arabia in the course of WTO accession except for labor recruitment\nand real estate trade,81 two core areas of brokerage in which royals are strongly\ninvolved and which have not evolved towards higher levels of productivity like\nother areas of business have. Similarly, commercial agencies and real estate\nremain off-limits for foreign investors in Qatar even after comprehensive\nFDI reforms.82\nThe Gulf states arguably constitute an extreme case of rentier brokerage, not\nleast due to their policies of national privilege. Future research will have to\nshow how important brokerage is in non-Gulf rentiers, and whether it could\nbe the basis for a general political sociology of rentier systems, which have\ntoo often been treated as black boxes. Much of the rentier literature does not\ngo beyond generalizations about patronage and the \u201cbuying off\u201d of social\ngroups, leaving the specific social structures involved largely unexplored.\nBrokerage is likely to be an important micro-mechanism involved in creating\nvarious rentier effects, including slow growth, low productivity, weak policy\nimplementation, and weak political participation.\nMoreover, rentier states are merely one sub-set of cases about which the\nbrokerage model makes particularly pronounced predictions. The basic argu-\nment made here is more universal: the extent of brokerage depends on the\nbalance of resources between state and society, combined with the level of\nstate accessibility. Figure 6 seems to impressionistically confirm the general-\nized brokerage argument. The more extreme non-rentier cases that combine\nbad bureaucracy with relatively high levels of income are all closely associated\nwith particularly ubiquitous clientelism and favoritism (such as Greece, Italy,\nand Lebanon), or pervasive corruption (such as Russia and Belarus).\n81 \u201cSaudi Arabian General Investment Authority, Negative list\u201d (of sectors closed for foreign\ninvestors): http:\/\/www.sagia.gov.sa\/english\/index.php?page\u00bcnegative-list.\n82 Simmons and Simmons 2007.\nT H E S O C I O L O G Y O F T H E G U L F R E N T I E R S Y S T E M S 33\n1377\n1378\n1379\n1380\n1381\n1382\n1383\n1384\n1385\n1386\n1387\n1388\n1389\n1390\n1391\n1392\n1393\n1394\n1395\n1396\n1397\n1398\n1399\n1400\n1401\n1402\n1403\n1404\n1405\n1406\n1407\n1408\n1409\n1410\n1411\n1412\n1413\n1414\n1415\n1416\n1417\n1418\n1419\nThis calls for further, more detailed research on non-rentier states, both those\nwith accessible bureaucracies and high levels of resources, and those with inac-\ncessible bureaucracies and various levels of resources.
