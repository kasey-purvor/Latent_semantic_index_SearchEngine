This review, which examined flexible working conditions and \ntheir effects on employee health and wellbeing, addressed one of the key principles of \naction outlined in the World Health Organisation\u2019s Commission on the Social Determinants \nof Health, namely to \u201cimprove the conditions of daily life \u2013 the circumstances in which \npeople are born, grow, live, work, and age\u201d [2, p.3].  It also serves to illustrate some of the \nthorny issues to be negotiated in a review of a complex public health intervention.   \n \nOur review evaluated the effects (benefits and harms) of flexible working interventions on \nthe physical, mental and general health and wellbeing of employees and their families. We \nalso aimed to examine whether any benefits or harms are differentially experienced by \ngender, age, ethnicity, occupation or socio-economic status. Our review included ten \nstudies of six different types of flexible working and it tentatively concluded that flexible \nworking interventions that increase worker control and choice (such as self-scheduling of \nworking hours or gradual\/partial retirement) are likely to have a positive effect on health \n 2 \noutcomes. The release of this review attracted considerable media attention, a tangible \nindicator of the level of public interest in this topic. This also represents a potential means \nfor increasing the utility of evidence, of which systematic reviews are an important part, in \nthe decision making process.  The full results are published in The Cochrane Library [1].  \n \nIn this paper we discuss three issues highlighted by the current review and the implications \nfor those striving to build the evidence base in this area: (i) a paucity of studies of a high \nquality design; (ii) a lack of data on implementation or motivation for the interventions and \n(iii) a dearth of evidence on differential effects of the interventions to understand the \npotential impacts on health inequalities.   \n \n(i) Study Design and Quality \nWe sought to synthesise the best available evidence on the effects of flexible working \nconditions, so our review included studies of the following designs: randomised controlled \ntrials, interrupted time series and controlled before and after studies. Included studies also \nhad to measure health outcomes using a validated instrument and studies assessing \noutcomes for less than six months were excluded. Our extensive search yielded 10 \ncontrolled before and after studies that met our inclusion criteria, however no evidence \nfrom randomized controlled trials was found.  This is not necessarily remarkable given the \nanticipated difficulties associated with randomising study participants to different types of \nflexible working conditions and serves to highlight a common challenge in evaluating \ncomplex interventions.  While there may not be randomized controlled trial evidence for an \nintervention of interest, it is valuable to synthesise available evidence, considering a \nvariety of study designs with associated strengths and limitations, and to identify gaps and \ndesign implications for future studies.  The featured review highlights a lack of suitable \nstudies evaluating the effects of teleworking or job sharing on employee health and, of the \n 3 \nstudies that were identified, design issues to be considered were short follow-up periods, \nrisk of selection bias and reliance on largely self-reported outcome data.  \n \n(ii) Implementation of interventions \nEchoing calls made by Doyle, Armstrong and Waters [3] and Egan et al. [4], our review \nalso called for future empirical studies to report the theoretical basis underpinning the \ninterventions as well as more detailed information relating to the processes of \nimplementation.  Specifically, we highlighted a deficiency of information on the motivation \nfor the flexible working interventions as well as a lack of detail on how the interventions \nwere designed and implemented. Reporting on implementation and process issues is \nimportant because of the well established role of local contextual factors in the success, or \notherwise, of complex public health interventions [5].  This is particularly relevant in \nworkplace interventions as those which are at the request of employees tend to have \nbetter health outcomes than those that are imposed [4,6-9]. In agreement with Rychetnik \net al. [10], descriptive information on implementation and the broader study context is vital \nin establishing the transferability of the findings to different populations and localities, thus \nmaximising the potential utility of the review.  \n \n(iii) Health Inequalities \nAnother important finding of the review was the dearth of evidence on the effects of flexible \nworking conditions on health inequalities.  On the basis that access to different forms of \nflexible working is likely to be socially patterned (e.g. shift work is more common in manual \noccupations) [11,12] and that women and ethnic minorities are overrepresented in jobs \nwith flexible conditions [13,14], we intended to conduct subgroup analyses to gain further \ninsight into the equity implications of flexible working practices. Tellingly no data were \nretrieved on the effects of flexibility by socioeconomic group, occupation or education level \n 4 \nand only one study reported results by gender.  It is recognised, however, that studies may \nhave \u2018unintentionally\u2019 collected data on health inequalities despite this not being an \nidentifiable aim of the study.  With this in mind, we contacted all authors of included papers \nto request additional data on subgroup analyses, however no further data were provided.  \nThe lack of inequality outcome data resonates with observations that more policy-ready \nevidence is needed to help determine the types of public health interventions that are \neffective in reducing health inequalities [15].  The lack of evidence on the equity \nimplications of flexible working has also been described in the context of systematic \nreviews of other types of workplace interventions, namely the effects of macro and micro \norganisational level changes to the work environment on health outcomes [6,7]. This \nemphasises the need for future public health research to incorporate a broader spectrum \nof data that allows for assessment of differential outcomes within relevant subgroups.   \n \nConcluding Comments \nThe paucity of evidence in all three areas highlighted here is not unusual in reviews of \ncomplex social interventions [16].  Our review underscores the need to further examine the \nseemingly beneficial role of employee control on health and wellbeing and provides \nvaluable information for employers and policymakers to consider the implications of \ngreater employee orientated flexibility.  Further, by highlighting evidence gaps, particularly \nthe shortage of data concerning implementation and differential effects, our review \nprovides signposts for the design of future empirical studies. \n \nThe ensuing media interest in the first Cochrane review published by the Public Health \nReview Group perhaps points to an increasing \u2018appetite\u2019 for evidence in the area of \ncomplex social interventions and represents a potential mechanism for enacting policy \nchange.  As the scope of the work of The Cochrane Collaboration continues to expand and \n 5 \nbranch beyond reviews of clinical interest to those of increasing public interest, the \nspectrum of potential end-users broadens and interventions have a tendency to become \nless easily defined and controlled.  While challenging, this only heightens the need for \nappropriate evidence syntheses to inform decisions and illuminate areas for further \ninvestigation.  \n \nReferences \n[1] Joyce K, Pabayo R, Critchley JA, Bambra C.
