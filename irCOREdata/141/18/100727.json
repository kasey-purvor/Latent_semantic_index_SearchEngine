INTRODUCTION\nOne of the most fundamental symmetries in Nature is\nthe exchange symmetry between neutrons and protons in\nthe nucleus, which reflects the approximate charge symmetry\nand charge independence of the attractive nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction. Although it is now known (see, e.g. [1]) that these\ntwo symmetries are only approximate, they retain enough\nvalidity to result in startling symmetries in nuclear behavior,\nwhich can be readily observed in the study of isobaric\nmultiplets. These symmetries lead naturally to the use of the\nisospin quantum number, T, one of the most powerful and\nelegant concepts in nuclear physics. States of the same isospin\nin a mass multiplet (i.e., isobaric analog states, IAS) will\nbe degenerate if electromagnetic effects are ignored and if\ncharge symmetry and\/or change independence are assumed.\nOf course, in nuclei, the Coulomb force between protons\nbreaks the symmetry and lifts the degeneracy of the IAS. The\nsimplest case to consider is that of a pair of mirror nuclei (A,B)\nwith Tz = (N \u2212 Z)\/2 = \u00b1 12 such that ZA = NA + 1 = NB\n\u2217Electronic address: mab503@york.ac.uk\nand ZB = NB \u2212 1 = NA. The Tz = \u00b1 12 pair discussed here,\n45\n23V22\/4522Ti23, is one such example. In such mirror pairs the\nenergy difference between excited states\u2014termed the mirror\nenergy differences, MED\u2014can be established through modern\nspectroscopic techniques and can yield direct information on\nCoulomb effects if the charge symmetry of the strong nuclear\nforce is assumed.\nOver the past decade, advances in experimental\ntechniques\u2014specifically the development of large \u03b3 -ray spec-\ntrometers coupled to sensitive channel-selection devices\u2014\nhave afforded the opportunity to study proton-rich nuclei\nin detail up to A\u2248 60. In the f7\/2 shell between 40Ca and\n56Ni, this has allowed the detailed spectroscopy of essentially\nall the Tz = \u00b1 12 mirror pairs [2\u201311] and the even-A T = 1\nisobaric triplets [12\u201318]. In all of these cases, the energy\ndifferences between excited states have been extracted and\ninterpreted in terms of Coulomb effects. One of the real\nsurprises is that the quantitative analysis of Coulomb energies\nby this approach has yielded far more reliable and subtle\ninformation on nuclear structure phenomena than had been\npreviously supposed. It is particularly surprising given the\nlong-established Nolen-Schiffer anomaly [19], which refers\nto the large discrepancy consistently found when attempting\n0556-2813\/2006\/73(2)\/024304(10)\/$23.00 024304-1 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society\nM. A. BENTLEY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 024304 (2006)\nto reproduce the binding energy differences of the ground\nstates of mirror nuclei. A key advantage of performing these\nstudies in the f7\/2 shell comes from the development of the\nlarge-scale pf-shell-model calculations, based on the code\ndescribed in Ref. [20], that are available in this mass region\nand that have been shown to be extremely reliable. The\nwork on isobaric analog nuclei has prompted modifications\nto the shell-model calculations to include both multipole\n(e.g. [7]) and monopole (e.g. [15,21]) Coulomb terms. Thus\nthis work provides an extremely stringent test of this important\nmodel and, conversely, the reliability of the model provides a\nvaluable tool in the interpretation of the measured Coulomb\nenergies.\nThe relative isolation of the f7\/2 shell from other major\norbits results in yrast structures whose state wave functions\nare dominated by pure (f 7\n2\n)n configurations (e.g. [22]), where\nn is the number of f7\/2 particles outside 40Ca. This, in turn,\nmeans that the evolution of Coulomb energies along the yrast\nline can be interpreted consistently without significant changes\nin configuration. It has now been demonstrated both exper-\nimentally (e.g. [2,6,7,10]) and theoretically (e.g. [8,15,21])\nthat the largest angular-momentum-dependent effect on the\nCoulomb energy in this mass region arises from the recoupling\nof pairs of f 7\n2\nprotons from J = 0 to J = 6. In addition, it has\nbeen possible to relate smaller variations in the MED to other\nspecific spin-dependent phenomena, such as changes in radius\nand\/or deformation as a function of spin [7,15,21].\nTo date, all the analysis of MED for nuclei in the f7\/2 shell\nhas been restricted to the natural parity structures dominated\nby (f7\/2)n configurations. However, nonyrast unnatural parity\nstates, which are based on one-particle-one-hole excitations\nfrom the d3\/2 orbital below 40Ca, are common in this region.\nThe Nilsson diagrams in the region show that particle-\nhole excitations from d3\/2 are expected to have a prolate\ndeformation-driving effect. The resulting strongly coupled\ndeformed collective structures built on low-lying J\u03c0 =\n3\n2\n+\nstates have been established in a number of light f7\/2\ncases, such as the Tz = + 12 nuclei 47V [23] and 49Cr [24]. As\nyet, there has been no analysis of Coulomb effects associated\nwith these structures through studies of the analog sequences\nin the less accessible Tz = \u2212 12 mirror partners.\nIn this paper we present, for the first time to our knowledge,\nan extensive level scheme of the Tz = \u2212 12 nucleus 45V.\nBefore this work some low-lying states of both parities\nhad been identified by Gronemeyer et al. [25]. The current\nwork identifies the negative-parity yrast structure up to the\nf7\/2 band-termination state. In addition, the positive-parity\nstructure based on the d3\/2 particle-hole excitation is extended\nup to high spins. MED have been established, and a detailed\nanalysis of the Coulomb effects for both structures is presented\nand supported by the predictions of the large-scale shell-model\ncalculations. In addition, we show evidence for an anomaly\nin the comparison of the \u03b3 -ray intensties depopulating the\npositive-parity structures.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe experiment was performed by using the Vivitron ac-\ncelerator at IReS Strasbourg. A 24Mg beam was accelerated to\n83 MeV and impinged on a 500 \u00b5g\/cm2 24Mg self-supporting\ntarget. The Tz = \u00b1 12 mirror pair, 45V and 45Ti, were then\nproduced in a fusion-evaporation reaction through the 1p2n\nand 2p1n evaporation channels, respectively. Gamma rays\nfrom the reaction were detected in the Euroball array [26,27]\nwhich, at the time, consisted of 26 Clover detectors and\n15 Cluster detectors, each containing 4 or 7 individual\nhyperpure Ge crystals, respectively\u2014a total of 209 individual\ndetector elements. Each individual Clover and Cluster detector\nunit was Compton suppressed, and within each unit \u03b3 -ray\nadd-back routines were applied to increase the total photopeak\nefficiency of the array for high-energy transitions.\nThe predicted cross section for 45V is expected to be of\nthe order of 1 mb\u2014around 100 times smaller than that of the\nmirror nucleus 45Ti. Given this, and the near-identicality of\nthe \u03b3 -ray transitions expected for the mirror pair, additional\nand unambiguous channel selection was necessary. To achieve\nthis, the evaporated particles were recorded in two ancillary\ndevices. The Euclides array [28] was used to record protons and\nalpha particles emitted in the reaction. Euclides consisted of 40\n\u0003E \u2212 E Si detector telescopes arranged in five rings. Each of\nthe five detectors in the most forward ring was electrically\nsegmented into four parts, making a total of 55 effective\ntelescopes in the whole array. Two-dimensional gates on the\nindividual \u0003E \u2212 E plots were used to discriminate between\nemitted alpha particles and protons. Of particular importance\nin this experiment is the identification of the number of\nneutrons emitted. For this purpose, the Euroball Neutron\nWall [29] was used, which consisted of 50 individual detectors,\ncontaining BC501A liquid scintillators, covering a solid angle\nof \u22481\u03c0 at forward angles and located at an average distance\nof \u22480.5 m from the target position. Discrimination between\n\u03b3 rays and neutrons was achieved by using a combination of\ntime-of-flight (TOF) and pulse-shape discrimination, the latter\nutilizing the zero-crossover time (ZCO) of a bipolar amplified\npulse. Discrimination was therefore achieved by using two-\ndimensional gates on individual TOF-ZCO matrices. For\nthis reaction and analysis procedure, the total efficiency for\nsingle-neutron detection with this array was found to be 15%.\nThe experimental trigger was defined when one neutron had\nbeen preidentified in hardware and at least one clean \u03b3 ray\nhad been recorded in Euroball, or when three \u03b3 rays or more\nhad been detected. The Euclides data was not specifically\nincluded in the trigger.\nIn the offline analysis the energy and angle information\nfrom the Euclides and Neutron Wall detector elements for\neach evaporated particle were used to perform a kinematic\nreconstruction of each event. This allowed the recoil vector of\nthe final nucleus to be determined, permitting a more accurate\n\u03b3 -ray Doppler correction. This then reduces the Doppler\nbroadening arising from the recoil cone.\nIII. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\nIn an attempt to unambiguously assign \u03b3 rays to the weak\nreaction channel of interest, 45V, singles \u03b3 -ray spectra were\ngenerated in coincidence with different combinations of evap-\norated particles. One such spectrum is found in Fig. 1(a), which\n024304-2\nHIGH-SPIN SPECTROSCOPY OF NATURAL AND . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 024304 (2006)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFIG. 1. Singles \u03b3 -ray spectra created with different conditions placed on the Euclides and Neutron Wall detectors. (a) Spectrum recorded\nwhen two protons and one neutron were detected. The numerically labeled peaks all originate from 45Ti (the 2p1n channel) and those labeled\nwith the filled squares correspond to 44Sc\u2014the 3p1n channel. The 2p2n channel (44Ti) is also present, but too weak to be labeled. (b) Spectrum\nrecorded when two neutrons were detected. The labeling scheme is the same as (a). (c) Same spectrum as (b), but having also applied the nearest-\nneighbor rejection procedure (see text). The peaks labeled with filled diamonds originate from the 2p2n channel, 44Ti. (d) The clean two-neutron-\ngated spectrum. The same as (c) but with an additional time-of-flight analysis applied (see text). The numerically labeled transitions are assigned\nto 45V.\nshows \u03b3 rays recorded in coincidence with two protons and one\nneutron. As expected, the 2p1n channel 45Ti dominates, with\nall the labeled peaks corresponding to known [30] transitions in\n45Ti. Also present, and marked in this spectrum, are transitions\nfrom the 3p1n channel, 44Sc, where one of the three protons\nemitted was not detected by the Euclides array. To produce\na similar spectrum for 45V, the 1p2n channel, a 2n-gated\nspectrum was produced (gating on the proton is not helpful,\nas all major channels have at least one proton emitted). This\nspectrum, requiring that two separate neutron detectors record\na neutron, is shown in Fig. 1(b). As can be seen, the spectrum\nis virtually identical to the 2p1n-gated spectrum of Fig. 1(a).\nThis is because when two neutron detectors record neutrons in\nmost cases this corresponds to one scattered neutron recorded\ntwice. To alleviate this, a nearest-neighbor-rejection procedure\nwas employed. In this method, particular pair combinations\nwere rejected based on their physical proximity. To determine\nthe acceptable separation of detectors, a correlation analysis\n024304-3\nM. A. BENTLEY et al.

(b) Solid curve, in coincidence with the\n600 keV transition in 45V. Dashed curve, in coincidence with the\n586 keV transition in 45Ti.\nwas performed in which the coincidence frequency of each\npair of detectors was analysed. Specific pair combinations\nwere rejected if the coincidence frequency was above a certain\nlevel. The spectrum resulting from this procedure is shown in\nFig. 1(c). Although some of the 45Ti remains, the spectrum is\nnow dominated by the 2p2n channel 44Ti\u2014the strongest of\nthe 2n channels.\nTo identify the 45V transitions, the remainder of the\nscattered 1n events need to be removed. This was achieved\nby an additional time-of-flight (TOF) analysis suggested by\nLjungvall et al. [31], where the difference in TOF between\nthe two neutrons in the 2n event is analyzed. For genuine 2n\nevents the TOF should be approximately the same for each\nneutron, and the TOF difference should be zero. For scattered\n1n events, now that near-neighbor coincidences have been\nremoved, the TOF difference should be nonzero. This can\nclearly be seen in Fig. 2(a), where the TOF difference is shown\nfor all 2n events (i.e., mostly scattered 1n events) and for events\nwhere the nearest-neighbor-rejection analysis has been applied\n(i.e., mostly real 2n events). The final pure 2n spectrum was\nproduced by gating on the central region of the TOF-difference\nspectrum, with appropriate background subtractions. The\nresult is shown in Fig. 1(d). Close examination of the spectrum\nshows that all of the 1n transitions have been removed. For\nexample, the insets in Fig. 1(a) to 1(c) all show the strong\n586 keV transition in 45Ti, which is completely gone in the\ninset of Fig. 1(d). Thus we can be confident that only genuine\n2n events remain.\nFigure 1(d) is, as expected, dominated by transitions from\nthe 2p2n channel, 44Ti, but should also contain the transitions\nfrom 45V. From the work of Gronemeyer et al. [25], a\nfew low-lying states and \u03b3 transitions had previously been\nidentified. The only known natural parity states were two\nnonyrast states with J\u03c0 = 32\n\u2212\nand 52\n\u2212\n, in addition to the\nJ\u03c0 = 72\n\u2212 ground state. The J\u03c0 = 32\n+\n, 52\n+\n, and 72\n+\nmembers\nof the band built on the d3\/2 intruder level had also been\nidentified. The 329 and 411 keV decays from the 32\n+\nand\n5\n2\n+\nstates, respectively, can be seen in Fig. 1(d). In addition to\nthese, and the well-known transitions in 44Ti, a number of other\npeaks can be identified that have energies very close to those in\n45Ti, and these we assign to 45V. Each of the labeled transitions\nin the 45Ti spectrum in Fig. 1(a) has a corresponding (mirrored)\ntransition in 45V, which is marked in Fig. 1(d). The strongest\nsuggested 45V transition is the 600 keV transition, presumed\nto be the mirror of the 586 keV J\u03c0 = 172\n\u2212 \u2192 152\n\u2212\ntransition in\n45Ti. Figure 2(b) shows the TOF-difference spectrum for these\ntwo transitions. Comparison with Fig. 2(a) clearly shows that\nthe 600 keV transition is associated with the emission of two\nneutrons.\nFigure 3 shows the level schemes of the A = 45 mirror pair,\non the left-hand side of which is the scheme of 45V deduced\nfrom this work. On the right-hand side is shown a portion of\nthe 45Ti level scheme, based on the comprehensive published\nlevel schemes of Bednarczyk et al. [30,32]. The current work\nconfirms the published schemes. The placement and ordering\nof the \u03b3 rays in the new scheme for 45V was achieved through\na detailed 2D and 3D \u03b3 -ray analysis, described below. Owing\nto the very close proximity of the \u03b3 -ray energies of the\ntransitions in the mirror pair, production of clean \u03b3 -ray gated\nspectra for 45V was extremely difficult, with only the 329 keV\ntransition providing a clean gate. In addition, the low beam\nintensity (\u00011 pnA) of the difficult 24Mg beam, coupled with\nthe low cross section for production of 45V, limited the statistics\nobtained. Thus, a clean two-neutron-gated \u03b3 -\u03b3 analysis was\nnot possible. These issues conspired to such an extent that\nan angular correlation analysis was not possible in this case.\nHowever, given that the placement of the \u03b3 rays in the scheme\nhas been confirmed through a \u03b3 -ray coincidence analysis (see\nbelow), we can confidently assign the multipolarities of the\n\u03b3 rays, and hence the spins and parities of the states, by\nmirror symmetry arguments based on comparison with the\nwell-known [30] 45Ti scheme. There is no evidence to date\nthat suggests that this method is not completely reliable, and\nwe therefore quote the spins and parities as unambiguous\nassignments, based on the well-established assignments of the\nanalog states in the mirror partner 45Ti [30]. The measured\nenergies and intensities of the \u03b3 rays, and the state energy, spin,\nand parity assignments are listed in Table I. The remarkable\nsimilarity in the decay intensities of the states (with one notable\nexception, which will be discussed later) can be seen in the\ntable.\nNo \u03b3 decays in the yrast f7\/2 (negative parity) band in\n45V have been observed previously. The members of this\nband were identified first in Fig. 1(d) by comparison with\nknown transitions in 45Ti and then confirmed through \u03b3 -ray\ncoincidence analysis. In this way the structure shown in Fig. 3\nup to the J\u03c0 = 272\n\u2212 band-termination state was established.\n024304-4\nHIGH-SPIN SPECTROSCOPY OF NATURAL AND . . .

Deduced energy level scheme (left) for 45V from this work. Spins and parities were assigned through mirror-symmetry arguments,\nand the widths of the arrows are proportional to the relative intensity of the \u03b3 -ray transitions. On the right is a portion of the 45Ti scheme, taken\nfrom Ref. [30] and confirmed in the present work.\nThe \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidence (doubles) analysis was undertaken with\na \u03b3 -\u03b3 matrix incremented on the condition that at least one\nneutron was detected. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show spectra\ngenerated in coincidence with the 787 keV ( 192\n\u2212 \u2192 172\n\u2212)\ntransition in 45V and the equivalent 743 keV transition in\n45Ti. The symmetry between the spectra is obvious, and the\nsequence up to the band termination is clearly seen. A triple\n\u03b3 -ray coincidence analysis was also undertaken to confirm\nthe ordering of the 45V scheme and to reduce contamination\nin the spectra. Figure 5(a) shows a spectrum generated in\ncoincidence with both the 787 keV transition and any one of the\n378, 600, or 953 keV yrast-band transitions in 45V. Figure 5(b)\nshows the equivalent spectrum produced by using the mirrored\ntransitions in 45Ti. Again the sequence is confirmed, and some\nof the weaker transitions are seen, such as those populating\nand de-exciting the J\u03c0 = 92\n\u2212\nstate (although the order of these\ntwo was not determined). It should be noted that the ratio\nof the intensities between the equivalent spectra for 45Ti and\n45V is always around the factor of 100 expected from the\nrelative cross sections. This can be seen clearly in Figs. 4,\n5, and 6.\nThe positive-parity sequence in 45V is based on the d3\/2\nJ\u03c0 = 32\n+ intruder band head at 386.1 keV [25]. Also observed\nin Ref. [25] were the J\u03c0 = 52\n+\nand 72\n+\nstates of this sequence.\nAll the other states shown in this sequence in Fig. 3 up\nto J\u03c0 = 192\n+\nare new. Gronemeyer et al. [25] identified\ntwo E1 transitions de-exciting the J\u03c0 = 32\n+\nstate. These\npopulate the nonyrast J\u03c0 = 32\n\u2212\nand J\u03c0 = 52\n\u2212\nstates at 57.2\nand 56.4 keV via 328.9 and 329.7 keV transitions. In the\ncurrent work, these two cannot be distinguished, so Fig. 3\nand Table I quote the measured average energy (329.1 keV),\nand the intensity is distributed equally between them. The\nsame approach is taken for the 741 keV transition decaying\nto these two near-degenerate states from the J\u03c0 = 52\n+ level\n(although Gronemeyer et al. show this decaying exclusively to\nthe J\u03c0 = 52\n\u2212\nstate).

[25].\nbFor these 329 and 741 keV transitions in 45V the final state cannot be determined in this work (see text).

Again, all the transitions in the sequence\nup to J\u03c0 = 192\n+\nare seen. This is confirmed in the triples\ncoincidence analysis. Figure 5(c) shows a spectrum generated\nin coincidence with both the 329 keV transition and any of the\n411, 475, 886, or 1217 keV transition in the positive-parity\nband in 45V. Figure 5(d) shows the equivalent spectrum\nproduced by using the mirrored transitions in 45Ti.\nAn example of how weak transitions were placed in the level\nscheme is shown in Fig. 6, which shows double-gated spectra\nfor the positive-parity structure. These spectra firmly place the\n1776 keV transition to be the J\u03c0 = 192\n+ \u2192 152\n+\nmember of the\nsequence (and not the J\u03c0 = 172\n+ \u2192 132\n+\n, as mirror symmetry\nof transition energies might suggest). Figures 6(a) and 6(c)\nshow spectra for 45V double-gated on both the 329 keV\ntransition and the (a) 1217 keV or (c) 1776 keV transitions.\nThis clearly shows that the 1217, 1421, and 1776 transitions\nare in sequence. The equivalent mirrored spectra for 45Ti are\nshown in Figs. 6(b) and 6(d).\nOne important result here is the obviously different intensity\nof the parity-changing decay(s) from the J\u03c0 = 52\n+\nstate in 45V\nwhen compared with that of 45Ti. In 45Ti, this intensity is\ncarried by the 707 keV transition to the J\u03c0 = 32\n\u2212\nstate.

Comparison of single-gated \u03b3 -ray spectra for the\nnegative-parity bands [(a) and (b)] and the positive-parity bands [(c)\nand (d)] for the mirror pair, respectively, 45V and 45Ti. Spectra were\ntaken from a coincidence matrix recorded when one neutron was\ndetected and are in coincidence with (a) the 787 keV transition in\n45V, (b) its mirrored transition, 743 keV, in 45Ti, (c) the 329 keV\ntransition in 45V, and (d) its mirrored transition, 292 keV, in 45Ti.\nIn the inset of Fig. 1(d) the 741 keV transition decaying\nfrom the analogous state in 45V can be seen and is about\na factor of 10 stronger (see Table I) in relative intensity. In\naddition to the evidence presented in Figs. 1(a) and 1(d),\nthe large difference in relative intensity between the 707\nand 741 keV analog transitions has also been confirmed in a\ntriples analysis. Although it has not been possible to measure\nthe proportions of the intensity flowing to the J\u03c0 = 52\n\u2212\nand\n3\n2\n\u2212\nstates individually, the total intensity decaying from the\nJ\u03c0 = 52\n+\nstate is much larger in 45V than in 45Ti. Indeed, if\nthe assignment of J\u03c0 = 52\n+ \u2192 52\n\u2212 for the 741 keV transition\nin Ref. [25] is correct, the equivalent transition in 45Ti is\neither missing or extremely weak. Due to the strength of the\n707 keV transition in 45Ti compared with the 414 keV M1\/E2\ntransition, strong contributions from multipoles of order 2\nand higher are considered unlikely, and so we presume that\nthis transition (and hence the mirrored 741 keV transition in\n45V) is purely E1 in character. The other two parity-changing\ntransitions seen to de-excite the J\u03c0 = 72\n+\nstate in 45Ti (the\n1226 and 1186 keV transitions) are of low relative intensity\n(see Table I).

DISCUSSION\nThe different E1 intensity is of considerable interest,\nas relative intensities between mirror pairs have previously\nbeen observed to be almost identical. Indeed, the two other\ncases of anomalous decay intensities that have recently been\nobserved\u2014for the A = 35 mirror pair at low spin [33] and at\nhigh spin [34] and the A = 31 [35,36] mirror pair\u2014both\ninvolve E1 transitions. In general, when considering the\nisospin dependence of transition strengths, it is found [37]\nthat E1 transitions, which proceed only through an isovector\ncomponent of the transition operator, should have identical\nstrengths in mirror partners. Indeed, this is not generally true\nfor E2 or M1 transitions\u2014although the expected approximate\nsimilarity in wave functions between mirror partners tends\nto result in similar decay branching ratios and hence similar\nrelative intensities. It is therefore noteworthy that this intensity\n024304-7\nM. A. BENTLEY et al.

Of course, the data presented so far consider\nonly relative intensities and not transition strengths. This\ninterpretation thus awaits measurement of transition strengths\nand, of course, detailed calculations.\nThe measured MED for the f7\/2 band, plotted as\nEx(J )[45V] \u2212 Ex(J )[45Ti], is shown in Fig. 7. It is now well\nestablished (e.g. [2,6,7,10] that the largest spin-dependent\nphenomenon contributing to Coulomb effects is the alignment\nor recoupling of pairs of protons from J = 0 to J = 6\u2014the\nmaximum allowed for an f7\/2 pair. As the spin recouples,\nthe spatial overlap of the pair is reduced, resulting in a\nreduction in the Coulomb energy. This effect is typically\naround 100 keV for f7\/2 particles. The largest effect observed\nin the experimental MED plot is the rise from \u2248\u221230 to\n\u2248 +50 keV from the lowest point around J\u03c0 = 132\n\u2212\nto the\npeak at J\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\n.

Indeed, one easily imagines the J\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\nstate in 45Ti with a configuration similar to the J\u03c0 = 72\n\u2212\nground state but with the two protons maximally aligned to\nJ = 6 rather than J = 0 \u2013 i.e. with a significant contribution\nfrom the [\u03c0 (f7\/2)2]J=6 \u2297 [\u03bd(f7\/2)3]J=7\/2 configuration. The\nsame is true for 45V, but swapping protons for neutrons. Thus,\nthe alignment of protons in 45Ti (and hence neutrons in 45V)\nresults in the MED peak at J\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\n. As the J\u03c0 = 272\n\u2212\nband-terminating state is approached, the alignment of the\nother type of particle is required in each case. Thus the\nCoulomb effects go in the opposite direction, and the MED\nreduces back toward zero at high spins. It is interesting to note\nthe overall downward trend of the MED at low spins, before\nthe alignment effect. There is no obvious intuitive explanation\nfor this, and this anomalous low-spin behavior has been seen in\na number of other cases (e.g., A = 47 and 49 [7]). It has been\nshown [10,21] that an anomalously high two-body Coulomb\nmatrix element for J = 2 needs to be incorporated into the\ncalculations to account for the experimental data. This is the\nso-called J = 2 anomaly. It is expected that this anomaly\nshould influence the MED at low spins, and the observed\nlow-spin variations seen in MED could be attributed, at least\nin part, to this anomaly. The presence of the negative dip in\nthe MED in this A = 45 pair [Fig. 7(a)] from J\u03c0 = 32\n\u2212\nto\nJ\u03c0 = 132\n\u2212 is also consistent with the effect of this anomaly,\nalthough Fig. 7(b) indicates that the radial Coulomb effect (see\nbelow) is also important here.\n024304-8\nHIGH-SPIN SPECTROSCOPY OF NATURAL AND . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 024304 (2006)\nAs with other studies in this shell, the large-scale pf-shell\nmodel has been used to help interpret these data. This model,\nbased on the work of Caurier et al. [20], has been modified\n(e.g. [7,15,21] to include different Coulomb phenomena and\nhas to date been remarkably successful in giving a quantitative\ndescription of the trends of Coulomb effects with spin. In\nFig. 7 we present the results of the latest version of the model,\ndescribed by Zuker et al. [21]. In this case three components\nof the MED are determined separately as a function of spin.\nThese components are presented individually in Fig. 7(b),\nthe sum of which provide the total shell-model prediction\nof Fig. 7(a). Details of this can be found in Ref. [21], but\nthe principles are outlined as follows. First, the Coulomb\nmultipole term accounts for angular momentum recoupling\nof protons. It uses Coulomb matrix elements determined in\na harmonic oscillator basis. Second, the Coulomb monopole\nterm accounts for Coulomb effects associated with changes in\nradii as a function of spin. Third, the isospin nonconserving\n(INC) component is an additional multipole term added for\nJ = 2 proton couplings, the inclusion of which accounts for\nthe J = 2 anomaly described earlier. In other cases of mirror\npairs higher in the shell, the agreement with this model has\nbeen extremely good (e.g. [7,8,10]). For this A = 45 pair,\nhowever, the agreement in Fig. 7(a) is less good, and for some\nstates (e.g., the J\u03c0 = 172\n\u2212\nstate) the model fails completely.\nIndeed, unlike in the heavier cases, there seems little to\nbe learned from examination of the different components\nin Fig. 7(b). Similar difficulties were experienced [21] in\ndescribing the A = 46 mirror pair. It is suggested that for these\nlighter systems the full pf valence space is not appropriate and\nthat perhaps two-particle two-hole excitations from the sd\norbits below 40Ca need to be included.\nIt is of particular interest in this work to examine the MED\nfor the d3\/2 band, which is shown in Fig. 8. Here the MED is\nplotted relative to the band-head energies of the corresponding\nJ\u03c0 = 32\n+\nstates. The MED shows a smooth decrease for most\nof the structure. It is possible to interpret this in a fairly\n5 9 13 17 21\n2J\n-80\n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\nExperiment - d3\/2 band\n2\/3 of A=46 MED\nM\nED\n (k\neV\n)\nFIG. 8. Mirror energy differences between states in 45V and 45Ti\nfor the positive-parity sequence as a function of spin. The dashed\ncurve shows the experimentally observed MED [12] for the A = 46\nmirror pair (46Cr\/46Ti) multiplied by a factor of 0.66 (see text).\nstraightforward way in terms of proton recoupling if it is\nassumed that (i) these structures correspond to a single d3\/2\nhole in 40Ca coupled to six f7\/2 valence particles and that\n(ii) the trends of the MED with spin are determined entirely\nby the f7\/2 particles \u2014 i.e., the d3\/2 hole is a spectator.\nThis analysis can be undertaken by carefully considering\nthe possible structure of the J\u03c0 = 32\n+ band-head state in 45Ti.\nThe state can be formed either from a d3\/2 neutron excita-\ntion (i.e. [\u03c0 (f7\/2)2\u03bd(f7\/2)4]J=0 \u2297 [\u03bd(d3\/2)\u22121]J=3\/2 or from a\nproton excitation \u2013 [\u03c0 (f7\/2)3\u03bd(f7\/2)3]J=0 \u2297 [\u03c0 (d3\/2)\u22121]J=3\/2.\nThat is, the T = 12 J\u03c0 = 32\n+\nstate in 45Ti is constructed\nby coupling either a d3\/2 neutron-hole to a T = 1, J \u03c0 =\n0+ even-even core (46Ti) or by coupling a d3\/2 proton-\nhole to a T = 1, J \u03c0 = 0+ odd-odd core (46V). These two core\nstates are, of course, isobaric analog states. Therefore, if we\nassume the approximations of perfect charge independence\nand pure isospin, we can determine the fractional contribution\nfrom each configuration from isospin coupling rules. The\ncontribution depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan\ncoefficient (T coreT corez , t \u2212 tz|T Tz), where t and tz are the\nisospin and the isospin projection of the excited particle.\nThe value of (|)2 turns out to be 23 for the former (neutron\nexcitation) and 13 for the latter (proton excitation). Following\na similar argument, the J\u03c0 = 32\n+\nstate in 45V is constructed\nby coupling either a d3\/2 proton-hole to a T = 1, J \u03c0 = 0+\neven-even core (46Cr) or coupling a d3\/2 neutron-hole to a\nT = 1, J \u03c0 = 0+ odd-odd core (46V)\u2014again with fractional\ncontributions of 23 and\n1\n3 . (Note, these fractions are also well\nreproduced from shell-model calculations). Hence it is easy\nto show that one might expect the trend of the the A = 45\nMED roughly to follow 23 of the MED for the known [12]\nT = 1 mirror pair 46Ti\/46Cr. This crude estimate is shown in\nFig. 8 (dashed curve) for comparison and, although such a\ncomparison on a state-by-state basis cannot be quantitatively\nmeaningful, the agreement of the overall trend up to J\u03c0 = 112\n+\nis impressive. To complete the story, it should be noted that\nthese T = 12 states can also be constructed by coupling a d3\/2\nhole to a T = 0 core (rather than T = 1). However, T = 0\nrestricts the core to N = Z 46V, for which the lowest T = 0\nstate is J\u03c0 = 3+. Thus, in both nuclei, this coupling would\nbe expected to produce a K\u03c0 = 92\n+ band head in addition\nto the K\u03c0 = 32\n+ band, and for states with higher spins than\nJ\u03c0 = 92\n+\nthere would be two sets of states that could readily\nmix. Shell-model calculations performed including a d3\/2\nexcitation [38] suggest that these two sets of states do indeed\nmix. This provides an explanation for the deviation of the two\ncurves at spins higher than J\u03c0 = 112\n+\n.\nV. SUMMARY\nA comprehensive new high-spin level scheme of the proton-\nrich nucleus 45V including both negative-parity states built on\nf7\/2 configurations and a collective positive-parity structure\nbuilt on a d3\/2 particle-hole excitation has been established.\nComparisons with the mirror partner 45Ti have been made,\nand the mirror energy, differences established and analyzed\n024304-9\nM.

In particular, the MED of\nthe structures built on the particle-hole excitation have been\ninterpreted in terms of a core-hole coupling picture based on\nisospin coupling rules. The E1 decay pattern observed in the\nmirror pair does not follow the same symmetry picture seen\nfor the M1\/E2 transitions. This appears to be an emerging\nphenomenon that needs to be investigated both experimentally\nand theoretically.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors particularly thank the accelerator staff at the\nVivitron facility at IReS Strasbourg for their enormous efforts\nin producing the difficult 24Mg beam needed for this run.
