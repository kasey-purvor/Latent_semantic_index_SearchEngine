INTRODUCTION\nThere is growing interest in the use of Scanning Tun-\nnelling Microscopy (STM) to probe quantum states lo-\ncalised just under the surface of a semiconductor. For\nexample, shallow donors in GaAs have been imaged re-\ncently [1, 2] as have Mn acceptors [3] and the electronic\nstates of cleaved self-assembled quantum dots [4, 5].\nSTM is able to probe these systems because it is a probe\nof the local density of states (LDOS) above the surface\n[6]. The sub-surface structure affects the LDOS hence\ncan be probed by STM. But why does sub-surface struc-\nture affect the surface LDOS so much that it can be im-\naged? And how can the images be simulated?\nThe puzzle is to understand how structure underneath\nthe surface affects the LDOS above the surface. The sur-\nface modifies the quantum states of the semiconductor\nand embedded sub-surface structures introduce further\nmodifications. In many systems, including the experi-\nmentally important case of GaAs(110), the second order\neffect that results from both modifications is likely to be\nsmall. Then the two effects decouple approximately and\nin the present work effective mass theory is used to show\nthat the lateral variation of the surface LDOS can be\nfound from a surface envelope function. This is given by\na weighted integral of the bulk envelope function that de-\nscribes the localised states of the sub-surface structure.\nThis result explains the sub-surface sensitivity of STM.\nIn addition, it enables images to be computed simply and\neconomically from known envelope functions.\nTo get more insight into the physics, consider a pure\nsemiconductor with an ideal bulk-terminated surface.\nThe bulk Bloch states match onto states that decay ex-\nponentially above the surface. The LDOS at energy E\nis the sum of the squared amplitudes of all Bloch states\nwith energy E so the LDOS above the surface decays\nexponentially into the vacuum but is modulated in the\nlateral direction by the cell-periodic parts of the Bloch\nfunctions. So the lateral variation of the LDOS is deter-\nmined by the periodicity of the crystal lattice.\nWhen sub-surface structures such as quantum dots are\nintroduced into a pure semiconductor of infinite extent,\nstates occur in the band gap. These localised states decay\nexponentially in all directions but may be represented as\na superposition of Bloch states. If this system is cleaved,\nthe quantum states around each sub-surface structure\nmatch onto a state that decays into the vacuum however\nthe decay is no longer a pure exponential decay. Instead\nit is a superposition of exponential decays that reflects\nthe superposition of Bloch states which forms the sub-\nsurface state. The LDOS is the squared amplitude of the\nsuperposition and it acquires a lateral variation whose\nlength scale is determined by the width of the sub-surface\nstate.\nThe STM image of the sub-surface structure is formed\nindirectly through its effect on the lateral variation of the\nLDOS above the surface. The only way to interpret the\nimage is to understand the relation between the localised\nstates of the sub-surface structure and the LDOS above\nthe surface. One approach is to calculate the LDOS with\nan atomistic method. However the quantum states of\ntypical sub-surface structures are so broad that millions\nof atoms are needed to obtain accurate results. Atomistic\ncalculations are difficult and expensive and offer little\ninsight into the relation between the quantum states of\nthe sub-surface structure and the STM image.\nAnother approach is to use effective mass theory. It\ngives an excellent description of shallow impurity states,\n2reproduces dot states semi-quantitatively and gives a\nsimple and intuitive picture of the physics of nanoscale\nsemiconductor structures. But in its usual form, it can-\nnot be used to find the surface LDOS. The problem is\nthat the effective mass wave function is a product of an\nenvelope function and a band edge Bloch function for\nthe bulk material. This form does not take account of\nthe wave function decay into the vacuum. It is clearly\nnot valid in the surface region although it has been used\nto calculate images in some situations [7]. A modified\neffective mass theory that can be used to estimate the\nsurface LDOS is the subject of the present work.\nThe main result is that the lateral variation of the\nLDOS above a sub-surface structure can be described\napproximately by a surface envelope function. The inte-\ngral that gives this function contains the product of the\nbulk envelope function of the localised quantum state of\nthe sub-surface structure and a slowly varying weighting\nfunction that is independent of the sub-surface structure.\nSo when the surface envelope approximation is valid, the\nlateral variation of the STM image can be found simply\nfrom the known bulk envelope function. In addition, the\nweight function has a power law decay into the surface, in\nstark contrast to the exponential decay of localised states,\nincluding those in the STM tip. The slow decay generally\nexplains why STM is sensitive to sub-surface structure\nand images calculated with the present approach agree\nwell with experimental data.\nII. THEORY\nA. Effective mass theory\nEffective mass theory gives localised quantum states\nin a semiconductor in the form\n\u2211\nm Fm(r)Um(r) where\nthe functions Um span the space of cell periodic functions\nand the Fourier expansion of each envelope function Fm\nis restricted to the first Brillouin zone [8, 9]. While the\nenvelope function description is exact if all the terms are\nretained in the sum, it is most useful when the Um are\ntaken to be the periodic parts of the Bloch functions at a\nband extremum. In many cases, this allows the localised\nstate to be approximated with a few envelope functions\nwhich are found from an effective mass equation. In the\nsimplest case of a shallow donor, only the conduction\nband envelope function is needed.\nThe problem with applying this to the surface is that\nthe wave function decays into the vacuum on an atomic\nlength scale. This rapid decay cannot be described with\nenvelope functions as the restricted Fourier expansion\nprevents each envelope function varying significantly on\na length scale shorter than the unit cell. This means a\nlarge number of terms, FmUm, would be needed to make\nthe envelope function description accurate. And there is\nanother difficulty. The rapid variation of the potential at\nthe surface means that the envelope functions would not\nobey simple effective mass equations with a local poten-\ntial. Instead, the generalised equations of Burt [9] would\nhave to be used but they involve a non-local potential\nthat is difficult to deal with.\nTo see how to overcome these problems, consider a\nthick slab that consists of a stack of unit cell layers. In a\nslab of pure material, without any sub-surface structure,\nthe potential is periodic in the two dimensions parallel to\nthe surfaces. Deep inside the slab it is close to periodic\nin the third dimension but rises to zero in the surface\nregions. The potential barrier between the interior and\nthe vacuum is a few eV so the quantum states decay ex-\nponentially into the vacuum on a length scale of a few\nangstroms. This system is termed the finite barrier slab\n(FBS). It can be idealised as a system in which the poten-\ntial rises to +\u221e at the surface with quantum states that\ngo to zero at the surface and vanish in the vacuum. This\nsystem is termed the infinite barrier slab (IBS). In slabs\nsuch as GaAs (110), which have a mirror plane parallel to\nthe surface, the IBS states are known to be a very good\napproximation to the FBS states [10]. This important\nphysics allows effective mass theory to be generalised to\nfind the surface LDOS.\nThe key step is to exploit the physics to neglect small\nquantities. Quantum states localised around a sub-\nsurface structure in a slab can be expressed as a super-\nposition of slab Bloch states, with coefficients that are\ndetermined from the Schro\u00a8dinger equation. The surface\nLDOS can be found from the FBS coefficients, however\nthey are difficult to analyse. In contrast the IBS coef-\nficients can be found easily. So consider what happens\nwhen the infinite barrier of an IBS is reduced to form an\nFBS. Clearly, both the coefficients and the Bloch states\nchange. It turns out that whenever the second order\nchange from the Bloch states and coefficients is negli-\ngible, the effect of the sub-surface structure decouples\nfrom the effect of the Bloch states. This allows the lat-\neral variation of the surface LDOS to be found from a\nsurface envelope function. Details are given in the next\nsub-section.\nB. Generalisation to a slab containing sub-surface\nstructure\nThe FBS and IBS both consist of N unit cells of edge\nlength d which occupy the region 0 \u2265 z \u2265 \u2212L = \u2212Nd,\nwhere the sample thickness L is typically large. The\nFBS states decay exponentially to zero when z > 0 and\nz < \u2212L while the IBS states goto zero there. The IBS\nand FBS are periodic in the two dimensions parallel to\nthe surfaces of the slab, (x, y) \u2261 \u03c1. Therefore the states\nas a function of \u03c1 have Bloch form and can be labelled\nby a k vector parallel to the surfaces, k\u2016, a band index, n\nand an index, p to distinguish states within a band. Thus\nthe IBS states are written as \u03c6nk\u2016p and the FBS states\nmay be written as \u03c6nk\u2016p + \u03b4\u03c6nk\u2016p. When the unit cell\nhas a mirror plane parallel to the surface the IBS states\ncoincide with the truncated crystal states introduced by\n3Zhang et al [10]. These states are a good approximation\nto FBS [10] and half-space (z \u2264 0) slab [11] states in\nsituations where coupling to surface states is weak. One\nsystem where this holds is GaAs (110) [10, 11], which is\nimportant because (110) is the natural cleavage plane of\nGaAs. When the truncated crystal states are a good ap-\nproximation, \u03b4\u03c6nk\u2016p is expected to be small in the bulk\nand this is used to derive an approximate relation be-\ntween states localised in the FBS and IBS.\nThe IBS and FBS states are complete so the localised\nstates of an IBS containing a sub-surface structure can be\nwritten as\n\u2211\nnk\u2016p\nank\u2016p\u03c6nk\u2016p. Similarly the FBS states\nare\n\u2211\nnk\u2016p\n(ank\u2016p + \u03b4ank\u2016p)(\u03c6nk\u2016p + \u03b4\u03c6nk\u2016p). When the\nlocalised state couples weakly to surface states, \u03b4ank\u2016p is\nexpected to be small and the FBS state above the sur-\nface is approximately\n\u2211\nnk\u2016p\nank\u2016p\u03b4\u03c6nk\u2016p because \u03c6nk\u2016p\nis zero there. This approximation is a key step. All the ef-\nfects of the localised state are contained in the coefficients\nank\u2016p which can be computed from IBS envelope func-\ntions without considering surfaces, while all the surface\neffects are contained in the functions \u03b4\u03c6nk\u2016p which can\nbe found independently by calculating FBS states. Thus\nthe difficulties of treating the surface may be avoided.\nThe IBS envelope functions, Fm, are used to find\nthe ank\u2016p. The procedure is simple only when there\nis a mirror plane parallel to the surface and only this\ncase, which includes GaAs(110), is considered here.\nIn this case the IBS states are the odd parts of the\nBloch functions of a periodic system of width 2L:\neik\u2016\u00b7\u03c1\n[\neik\u22a5zunk\u2016k\u22a5(\u03c1, z)\u2212 e\u2212ik\u22a5zunk\u2016k\u22a5(\u03c1,\u2212z)\n]\n, where\nthe unk\u2016k\u22a5 are normalised to unity in \u2212L \u2264 z \u2264 L and\nk\u22a5 = pip\/L where p is an integer in the range 1 to N\nif band n is even under z inversion and 0 to N if it\nis odd. The envelope function expression,\n\u2211\nFmUm, is\nfound in the usual way [8, 9] with the unitary transfor-\nmation unk\u2016k\u22a5 =\n\u2211\nm \u03b1nk\u2016pmUm. Because of the mirror\nsymmetry, the Um are either odd or even under z inver-\nsion so the IBS states are\n\u2211\nmk\u2016p\n[\n2bmk\u2016pe\nik\u2016\u00b7\u03c1\n{\ncos(pipz\/L)\ni sin(pipz\/L)\n]\nUm \u2261\n\u2211\nm\nFmUm,\nwhere bmk\u2016p =\n\u2211\nn ank\u2016p\u03b1nk\u2016pm, the cosine factor ap-\nplies when Um is odd under z inversion and the sine fac-\ntor applies when it is even. The Fm satisfy the effective\nmass equations derived by Burt [9]. The boundary con-\nditions are Fm \u2192 0 at z = 0,\u2212L when Um is even and\n\u2202Fm\/\u2202z \u2192 0 at z = 0,\u2212L when Um is odd.\nWhen the Fm vary slowly, the FBS states above the\nsurface can be approximated by the product of a surface\nenvelope function and Bloch factor. Because the varia-\ntion is slow, only small k Fourier components are signif-\nicant so unk\u2016k\u22a5 \u223c un00, \u03b1nk\u2016pm \u223c \u03b4nm and ank\u2016p \u223c\nbnk\u2016p. In addition, \u03b4\u03c6nk\u2016p can be approximated. It\nhas Bloch form, \u03b4\u03c6nk\u2016p = e\nik\u2016\u00b7\u03c1wnk\u2016p(\u03c1, z) and if w\nvaries slowly with k\u2016 and p, wnk\u2016p \u223c wn00. In this case\u2211\nnk\u2016p\nank\u2016p\u03b4\u03c6nk\u2016p \u223c\n\u2211\nn(\n\u2211\nk\u2016p\nank\u2016pe\nik\u2016\u00b7\u03c1)wn00 \u2261\n\u2211\nn Fsn(\u03c1)wn00(\u03c1, z), where Fsn is the surface envelope\nfunction. This form is similar to the one found in the the-\nory of bulk shallow impurities [8] and the approximations\nleading to it are also similar.\nFsn is found from Fn by using the approximation\nank\u2016p \u223c bnk\u2016p and performing the sum over k\u2016 and p.\nFor an even band\nFsn(\u03c1) =\n1\niL\nN\u2211\np=1\n\u222b\n0\n\u2212L\nFn(\u03c1, z) sin\npipz\nL\ndz\n\u2261\n\u222b\n0\n\u2212L\nFn(\u03c1, z)Gn(z)dz, (1)\nwhere\nGn(z) =\nsin(piz\/2d)\niL\nsin[(N + 1)piz\/2L]\nsin(piz\/2L)\n.\nFor an odd band, Gn is similar but i cos(piz\/2d) re-\nplaces sin(piz\/2d). The physics of sub-surface STM fol-\nlows from Eq. (1). The bulk envelope function for states\nlocalised around a sub-surface structure is large in the\nsub-surface region where |z| \u226a L. In this regime Gn \u223c\n2 sin2(piz\/2d)\/ipiz so the influence of the sub-surface state\npropagates to the surface with a weight \u223c 1\/|z|. This\nrelatively slow decrease of weight with depth is the rea-\nson why the surface LDOS is so sensitive to sub-surface\nstructure.\nThe validity of the surface envelope approximation de-\npends mainly on the sensitivity of w to k\u2016 and p. This\nwas tested with pseudopotential calculations performed\nwith ABINIT [12]. Results for a GaAs slab within the\ncentral 10 % of the Brillouin zone show that the w vari-\nation at 0.5 nm above the surface is < 12 % with the\nlargest variation in the least significant Fourier compo-\nnents. This suggests that the approximation is accurate\nenough for qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of\nSTM images.\nSome modifications are needed to apply the theory\nto strained, heterogeneous systems such as cleaved self-\nassembled quantum dots. The cell periodic functions are\ndefined in the way suggested by Burt [9] and the effect\nof strain is taken into account with a co-ordinate trans-\nformation [13]. When cleaved, a strained crystal relaxes\nso its surfaces are not flat. The co-ordinate transforma-\ntion converts a strain relaxed slab into one with parallel\nfaces and leads to a modified surface envelope function,\nFsn \u2192 Fsn\/\n\u221a\nJ where J is the Jacobean of the transfor-\nmation. The effect of this is a few %, of the same order\nas the strain.\nIII. APPLICATION TO CLEAVED QUANTUM\nDOTS\nTo test the theory it is applied to the conduction band\nstates of a cleaved, self-assembled InGaAs quantum dot\n(CQD) embedded in a GaAs matrix. The conduction\n4band CQD states are found from a single band approx-\nimation so the CQD state above the surface is approx-\nimately Fsc(\u03c1)wc00(\u03c1, z). However, as the atomic scale\nstructure due to wc00(\u03c1, z) is not seen in the available\nexperimental data only the large scale variation caused\nby Fsc(\u03c1) is compared with the experimental results.\nA. Calculation\nExcluding the atomic scale factor, an approximation\nfor the observed STM tunnelling current I can be de-\nduced from the results in Ref. [6]. At tip position (\u03c1t, zt),\nI = A\n\u2211\nj\n|F jsc(\u03c1t)|2ft(Ej)gt(Ej)T (Ej , eV ), (2)\nwhere the jth eigenstate has energy Ej and surface enve-\nlope function F jsc, and A is a constant that is treated\nas a fitting parameter. The tip density of states is\ngt,ft(Ej) = 1\/(1 + exp((Ej \u2212 EF )\/kBT )) and EF is the\ntip Fermi energy. The tunnelling factor is\nT (Ej, eV ) = exp(\u22122zt\n\u221a\n2m\u03c6\u2032\/h\u00af)\nwhere the average barrier height is \u03c6\u2032 = (\u03c6t \u2212 eV + \u03c7\u2212\nEj)\/2, \u03c6t = 4.5 eV for the tungsten tip, and the electron\naffinity of GaAs is \u03c7 = 4.07 eV. The relative contribu-\ntions to I from each of the surface envelope functions\ncan be controlled by varying EF and this is done ex-\nperimentally by altering the bias voltage on the tip. In\nthe present case EF is below the GaAs conduction band\nedge and only the localised states of the CQD contribute\nsignificantly to the STM current.\nThe CQD envelope functions are calculated with a\nvariation of the method in Ref. [14]. The single band,\neffective mass Hamiltonian of the CQD is diagonalised\nexactly and, because only the blocks of the Hamiltonian\nwith odd symmetry in z are included, the states go to 0\nat the surface of the IBS where z = 0.\nThe starting point for the calculation of the dot Hamil-\ntonian is a model of the CQD (see Fig. 1) where the\nshape, size and composition profile, c(r), were deter-\nmined by earlier topographic cross-sectional STM mea-\nsurements [15]. The dot Hamiltonian is\nH =\n\u2212h\u00af2\n2\n\u2207M\u22121\u2207+ V (r), (3)\nwhere M\u22121 is the strained effective mass tensor and the\nelectron confinement potential, V (r) = Vo(r)+Vc(r), con-\ntains a contribution, Vc(r), from the strain and a contri-\nbution, Vo(r), from the position dependent conduction\nband offset [16]. The strain field after cleaving the dot\nis calculated with a continuum finite element model and\nused to generate Vc(r) [17]. The position dependent com-\nponents of the effective mass tensor are then calculated\nfrom the strain field using first order perturbation the-\nory [17].

The surface is at z = 0. The\ngrowth direction is y, with y = 0 at the centre of the dot and\nwetting layer system. The InAs fraction c varies linearly from\n0.7 at the bottom of the dot to 1.0 at the top [15].\nV (r) is much deeper near to the interface than would be\nexpected from the potential in an uncleaved dot and this\nis because, when cleaved, the dot relaxes and the strain\nis reduced.\nTo obtain rapid convergence (to within 0.1 meV) for\nthe energies of the localised states the CQD eigenstates\nare expanded in a basis of 1D harmonic oscillator func-\ntions [14] with different length scales in each x, y, z direc-\ntion. There are 4 states bound within the dot at ener-\ngies of \u2212226.0 meV, \u2212120.5 meV, \u221257.1 meV and \u221240.3\nmeV relative to the GaAs conduction band edge. The\ndominant contribution to the in-gap STM current comes\nfrom only the two lowest energy states. These states are\nlocalised 4.2 and 3.8 nm respectively below the surface\nand the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of their\nsquared modulus is about 3 nm.\nThe tip induced band bending seen in many STM ex-\nperiments is not important here. The effect on the two\nlowest bound states of the CQD is small because their\nbinding energy is large. This was confirmed by using\na 1D model to compute the effect of tip induced band\nbending at a tip voltage of 1 V (near the centre of the ex-\nperimental range). This additional potential pushes the\nstates away from the surface and this reduces the am-\nplitude and the width of the surface envelope functions.\nBut the amplitude of these functions is unimportant and\nthe FWHM of the two lowest energy functions changes\nby only 4.7% and 0.4% respectively. For simplicity, the\ntip induced band bending is therefore neglected.\nImage charge effects are also small and have been ne-\nglected. The abrupt dielectric interface between the dot\nand vacuum at the cleavage plane introduces an image\npotential. Our calculations suggest the effect of this po-\ntential is small, of the order of 5 meV on the dot binding\nenergies and less than 0.5% on the FWHM of the two\nlowest surface envelope functions.\n5 0\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 12\n 14\n-15 -10 -5 0 5 10\nST\nM\n c\nur\nre\nnt\n (p\nA \nun\nits\n)\nx (nm)\nFIG. 2: In-gap STM current along x at y = 0 nm.

EF is given relative to the GaAs conduction band edge.\nB. Experiment\nCross-sectional scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ex-\nperiments were performed under UHV conditions (P <\n4 \u00d7 10\u221211 Torr) using an omicron STM1, TS-2 scanner,\nwith tips prepared as described in Ref. [18]. The mea-\nsurements were performed on in situ cleaved (110) sur-\nfaces of MBE grown structures containing InGaAs dots\nwithin a GaAs matrix. The details of the sample prepa-\nration have been reported elsewhere [15]. To investigate\nthe CQD electronic structure, current imaging tunnelling\nspectroscopy was acquired simultaneously at room tem-\nperature with the topographic images shown in Ref. [15].\nAt every point on a 0.09 by 0.09 nm grid, tunnelling spec-\ntroscopy (I-V) curves were measured at every 0.015 V\nbetween bias voltages of \u22122.6 and 2 V with the feedback\nloop switched off. The vertical position of the tip was\ntherefore held stationary and all topographical dependen-\ncies on the tunnelling current were removed. Tunnelling\nbelow the GaAs band gap, into the empty CQD states,\nwas observed between 0.7 V and 1.2 V. At higher voltages\na significant amount of tunnelling into the GaAs matrix\nwas observed in addition to the tunnelling into the dot\nstates. To reduce the noise in each dataset, each spatial\npoint was averaged over 6 consecutive voltage points.\nC. Comparison between theory and experiment\nFig. 2 shows experimental and calculated in-gap STM\ncurrents along a line in the x direction through the centre\nof the CQD at y = 0 nm. The comparison between ex-\nperiment and theory is restricted to low bias voltages (0.7\nto 1.2 V) where the tunnelling is predominantly into the\nlowest bound states in the CQD. As the voltage range\nis small, the tip Fermi energy can be assumed to vary\nlinearly with applied voltage, EF = \u03b1V +\u03b2 where \u03b1 and\n\u03b2 are constants. The actual relation between EF and V\nis unclear because of the tip induced band bending and\nhence \u03b1, and \u03b2 (in addition to the constant A in Eq. (2))\nare treated as fitting parameters and adjusted to give the\nbest match between the calculated in-gap STM current\nand the experimental data. In Eq. (2), T (Ej , eV ) was\napproximated by the WKB result for a square barrier\nbetween the tip and the quantum dot. However, the ex-\nact form of T has little effect on our calculated results:\nat EF = \u221291 meV, approximating T (Ej, eV ) by unity\nresults in a change in the FWHM of I of less than 2%.\nTo obtain the curves in Fig. 2 the values \u03b1 = 410\u00b190,\n\u03b2 = \u2212540\u00b170 meV and A = 1.8\u00b10.3\u00d7105 are used. At\nthe lowest bias voltage, where the tunnelling is only into\nthe ground state, the experiment and theory fit extremely\nwell. At higher voltages the fit is still reasonable although\nthe calculated curves are slightly too narrow. At large V\nthe tip induced band bending might be expected to be\nimportant but this will reduce the width of the calculated\ncurves. Instead, the difference between experiment and\nthe calculation is more likely to be caused by alloying\nbetween dot and matrix material at the dot edges which\nwill soften the edges of the confinement potential and\nincrease the width of the more weakly bound states.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nA simple technique for calculating quantum states\nabove sub-surface structures has been developed. The\napproach relies on two approximations. First, the quan-\ntum state of the sub-structure is found from the bulk\nenvelope function for the structure in an infinite barrier\nslab and the band states of a finite barrier slab. Then a\nsecond approximation is used to express the state above\nthe surface as the product of a surface envelope function\nand a Bloch factor. The slow variation of the weight fac-\ntor used to calculate the surface envelope function from\nthe bulk envelope function explains the sub-surface sen-\nsitivity of STM and computed wave function images of\na cleaved self-assembled dot are in good agreement with\nexperiment.\nThe approach developed here applies to any sub-\nsurface structure, provided the approximations leading\nto the surface envelope function are valid. In addition, it\nis most convenient when a single band approximation is\nvalid. The results in section III C suggest that this is the\ncase for cleaved quantum dots. Currently, there is also\nsignificant interest in STM imaging of sub-surface impu-\nrities but the physics of impurities very close to the sur-\nface is not well understood. There is evidence that the ef-\nfective mass approach with a small number of bands loses\naccuracy when the impurities are very close to the sur-\nface [1, 19] and tip-induced band bending can change the\noccupancy of impurity states and modify the STM image\n[1, 2]. Further analysis is therefore needed to determine\nwhether the quantum states of near-surface impurities\n6satisfy the conditions needed to apply the present ap-\nproach. In all cases, the approximations developed here\nare likely to be most useful for computing the large scale\nstructure of wave function images, rather than atomic\ndetail. They have the advantages that images can be\ncomputed easily from known envelope functions and at\na much lower computational cost than atomistic calcula-\ntions.\n[1] A. P. Wijnheijmer, J. K.
