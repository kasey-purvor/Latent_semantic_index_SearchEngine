In 2010 the group reported a total \nturnover of \u00a31,226.5 million, operating profit of \u00a3164 million and after tax profits of \u00a398.9 \nmillion.   \nOver half of Informa\u2019s total annual operating profit was derived from academic publishing: \n\u00a385.8 million. Looking in a little more detail, we discover that academic publishing produced \na net profit margin for Informa of over 35 per cent compared to the 4 per cent profits \nderived from their \u2018events\u2019 division. A little more reading above the line here, along with \ncomparison with other publishers\u2019 public accounts, suggests that journals provided gross \nprofit margins of over 70 per cent. This seems to be a fairly healthy return in an economic \nclimate in which the real return on seen-to-be-safe long term government debt is frequently \nnegative. So, one would think, surely the executives of fine engines of the knowledge \neconomy \u2013 such as Informa \u2212 would be more than happy with the level of profitabilty that \nthey are garnering from publicly funded labour (see also Monbiot, 2011 and Beverungen et \nal, this volume).  \nSuch a position fails to recognise just how feral some of our allies in the academic supply \nchain can be. For Informa formally moved abroad in 2009,1 upon which the company \nbecame a Jersey company domiciled in Zug, Switzerland. The canton of Zug has the lowest \ntax rates in Switzerland.2\nInforma\u2019s accounts suggest that the move cost something in the region of \u00a34.3 million, \nconstituting a net \u2018saving\u2019 for the organisation of just shy of \u00a38 million (but of course, still \nimplying  a total net loss to the UK treasury of something in the order of \u00a313 million), with \nthese \u00a34.3 million in \u2018costs\u2019 seemingly largely taken up with the expenditure attendant upon \nredomiciling their senior executives. And along with these housing perks there are some \n Income tax \u2018works out at just 10 per cent on average\u2019(Switzerland \nin the UK - Supplement to the International Swiss Review, 07\/04\/2010).  \u2018Informa, who own \nthe international shipping bible Lloyd\u2019s List, says the move has saved it a cool \u00a312 million a \nyear.\u2019 (Switzerland in the UK - Supplement to the International Swiss Review, 07\/04\/2010). \n                                                          \n1 Although the move had been discussed as early as 2006 (interview with company secretary John Burton by \nAbigail Townsend, The Lawyer, 18 March 2011). \n2 Corporate Tax rate in Zug, is approx. 19%, but Peter Robinson of Forbes suggests deals can be cut with Swiss \nofficials to negotiate rates down to around 10%. However, uncertainty prevails over the exact tax rate as \nalternative estimates place the corporate rate between 15-16% (http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/2009\/09\/17\/taxes-\ncorporations-business-globalization-opinions-peter-robinson.html, last consulted 30th August 2011), and \nindividual rates at 12.3% (http:\/\/www.fita.org\/countries\/ch.html?ma_rubrique=fiscalite, last consulted 30th \nAugust 2011), suggesting a particular fluidity to rates in the canton. \n \nsignificant other benefits for our doughty stewards.  The four senior executives who \u2018moved\u2019 \nto Zug as part of the deal will also have seen their personal tax liability slashed. Certainly the \nchief executive will have dodged a considerable sum of income tax each year, given the \ndifference between the top 50 per cent rate in the UK and the headline 10 per cent rate in \nZug. His Informa income, drawn from their annual statement, is detailed in Table 1, below \n(and converted into British Pounds). Were the standard rates of tax to have been applied to \nall his income (unlikely, of course, given the elliptical schemes by which many CEOs are \nrewarded), then the amount skipped would be considerably over half a million pounds a \nyear.  \nTable 1: Informa CEO annual remuneration, 2010 \n Swiss francs Pounds sterling \nSalary 1,190,000 810,390 \nBenefits 270,000 183,870 \nBonus 1,285,000 875,085 \nDeferred Bonus 94,538 64,380 \nLong Term Incentive Plan 155,229 105,711 \nTotal 2,994,767 2,039,436 \n \nBusiness as usual? Well perhaps. But maybe not so usual as to merit no commentary. In a \ncontext in which groups such as UK Uncut are keen to highlight alternatives to the There Is \nNo Alternative mantra of ever increasing austerity \u2013 not to mention an impending fees \nregime in which potential students are being invited to pay three times the amount for \nexactly the same product \u2013 it does seem to us to be little bit beyond even the ordinary pale.  \nWhilst Informa\u2019s tax avoidance does render it as something of a moral outrider here, it is far \nfrom alone in scalping the public purse for private profit in pursuit of disinterested truth. As \nTable 2 makes clear, academic publishing is, and is increasingly, a veritable licence to print \nmoney.  \nTable 2: Journal publishing profitability \n Journal\/publishing \nturnover \nOperating \nProfit \nOperating \nProfit % \nGross \nprofit \nGross \nprofit \n% \nThe \u2018big 3\u2019 \nElsevier \u20ac2,026,000,000 \u20ac647,000,000 31.9 Not \navailable \nNot \navailable \nSpringer \n(STM \ndivision) \n\u20ac655,000,000 \u20ac238,000,000 \n(EBITDA) \nNot \navailable \nNot \navailable \nNot \navailable \nJohn Wiley \n(STMS \n$986,683,000 $405,244,000 41.1 Not \navailable \nNot \navailable \ndivision) \nSelected other publishers \nInforma \n(journals & \nbooks) \n\u00a3294,400,000 \u00a3109,300,000 29.1 Not \navailable \nNot \navailable \nSage (UK) \u00a377,269,000 \u00a314,365,000 18.6 47,929,000 62.0 \nEmerald \u00a332,756,000 \u00a38,720,000 26.6 25,396,000 77.5 \nAll figures taken from most recent publicly available financial statements \nThe net profits secured by all of these major publishers are, to put it mildly, substantial.

Gross profit \u2013 the profit realised after production and \ndistribution \u2013 might give a better picture but where the big three publish gross profit \nfigures, they include profits from a range of other activities. To get an indication of the kind \nof profits available from journal publishing, we can look at some of the smaller publishers, \nparticularly those registered in the UK, where disclosure requirements for limited \ncompanies are relatively high. \n    \nSage, the publisher of this journal, shows a gross profit across both books and journals of \nover 60 per cent. A smaller publisher, Emerald, which concentrates more on journals, is able \nto register a gross profit of over 75 per cent. Given that the perceived quality of the journal \nenables publishers to demand higher prices, and Emerald has relatively few highly ranked \njournals, it is likely that gross profits for journals for major publishers are even higher than \nthe 77 per cent recorded by Emerald.  \nWe are aware of only two other industries where these sorts of return are on offer: that in \nillegal drugs and the delivery of university-level business education. We have, of course, \nlimited experience of the former; rather more of the latter. However, we would note that \nthe scalping associated with business education must itself be viewed in the context of \nrestricted public financial support confronting a touching desire within the sector for \nmaintenance of a university worth of the name.  \nResearch into publishing \nJournal publishing is increasingly researched, providing a rich seam of material that finds its \n                                                          \n3 Springer in Luxembourg, John Wiley in Delaware. \nway into academic journals themselves, and beyond. A few minutes\u2019 exploration on the \nEBSCO database reveals exponential growth in this area over the past two decades or more: \nbetween 1991 and 1995 fewer than 100 peer-reviewed articles were published with \n\u2018scholarly publishing\u2019 or \u2018journal publishing\u2019 as subject terms.4\nAs Loughborough University\u2019s Library and Information Statistics Unit (LISU; a unit that has \nbeen collecting data on library expenditure since 1987) reports, \n Over the next five years, \nmore than 300 such pieces were published; in the period 2001\u221205, almost 700 articles on \npublishing were published; and for 2006\u221210, more than 2,000. Of course, not all these \narticles are directly relevant to the questions we are interested in here, but a good number \nof them are. This perhaps reflects an increasing concern, as here, in the rapidly appreciating \ncosts of academic journals.  \nSerial subscriptions spend by UK higher education institutions (of which peer-reviewed \nscholarly journals are a sub-set of unknown size) totalled \u00a394.5 million in 2003-2004 \n[and which we estimate, from LISU\u2019s Lampost archive, to be over \u00a3130 million in \n2008\/9].  The number of current serial subscriptions has doubled in higher education \ninstitutions over the past ten years.  Much of this growth in volume is thought to be \nattributable to \u2018bundled\u2019 or packaged deals offered by publishers.  \nPublished sources estimate publisher revenues of circa $5 billion for English-language \njournals in scientific, medical and technical disciplines in 2004.  It is likely that this is a \nsignificant under-estimate of the total peer-reviewed journal market (it excludes non-\nEnglish language journals, journals in disciplines outside of STM such as social \nsciences, the arts and humanities and is necessarily based on \u2018best estimates\u2019 of \njournal revenues derived from figures in published accounts). (Oppenheim\/LISU 2006: \n5\u22126) \nThe average journal price, from a UK publisher in 2009 for journals in the area of social \nsciences, was \u00a3510.66. (LISU \nhttp:\/\/www.lboro.ac.uk\/departments\/ls\/lisu\/lampost10\/exp10.html last consulted 30 \nAugust 2011). As an example, the institutional subscription price of Organization is \nprovisionally set at \u00a3891.25, at least for the University of Leicester. It is apparent that \nalthough not every HE institution in the UK that teaches business and management \nsubscribes to it, the vast majority do. This suggests that the revenue from institutional \nsubscribers to Organization in the UK alone will be in the region of \u00a390,000. For a more \nexpensive journal, such as Routledge\u2019s International Journal of Human Resource \nManagement, we are probably looking at UK institutional revenues in the order of \n\u00a3200,000.  \nMore generally, Dewatripont et al. (2007) explore pricing in 2003 of 2,630 journals across 22 \n                                                          \n4 All EBSCO databases. \nfields of social and natural sciences. They distinguish publishers into three types: for-profit; \nnot-for-profit (learned societies, university presses, etc.); and for-profit publishers \ndistributing on behalf of learned societies. Using econometric analysis they find that a \nnumber of factors affect journal pricing. First, and most importantly, for-profit publishers \ncharge roughly four times more than not-for-profit publishers, with for-profits publishing on \nbehalf of scholarly societies charging twice as much. (This confirms Bergstrom and \nBergstrom\u2019s (2004) finding that a journal page published by a for-profit is between three \nand five times more expensive than one published by a not-for-profit.) \nDewatripont et al. also find that more highly-cited journals are more expensive, with this \neffect being more pronounced for journals published by for-profits. They suggest that \ncitation-counts are \u2018an indication of \u201cquality\u201d and of high value to the reader. This can turn a \nprofit-maximizing publisher to raise its price because the willingness to pay of readers \nincrease\u2019 (sic., pp. 405\u22127). Though, as they point out, one would expect more highly cited \njournals to have a wider circulation and therefore lower average production costs. \nThey find that journal subscription prices increase with number of articles, with a 10 per \ncent increase in the number of articles increasing price by 3\u22125%, and that English-language \njournals are 20\u221260 per cent more expensive than journals published in other languages. This \nis not always the case: one of our sources alleges that the then editor of this journal was \napproached by his Sage contact, who proposed increasing the number of issues printed \neach year. When the editor expressed doubts about the work involved in managing the \nextra content, the Sage representative confessed that there was no need to include more \npapers since the same number of accepted submissions could be spread more thinly across \nmore issues. However, the additional issues could be used to justify an increase in the \nsubscription price. \nFinally, investigating the large differences in journal pricing across scientific fields, with \naverage prices varying by a factor of up to 6, Dewatripont et al. discover these are \ncorrelated with publishers\u2019 market power: the higher the concentration ratio in a particular \nfield, the higher the average journal price.  \nMany of these concerns were shared by the Office of Fair Trading, which concluded in 2002 \nthat \u2018the market [in journal publishing] may not be working well\u2019 (OFT 2002). In particular, \nthe OFT registered concerns over price increases above inflation; the disparity in prices \nbetween commercial and non-commercial scientific, technical and medical (STM) journals; \nthe profitability of commercial STM publishing, which it estimated to be 10\u221215 per cent \nabove other forms of commercial journal publishing; and the development of terms for \nelectronic access and \u2018bundling\u2019, which it feared would hinder others from entering the \nmarket. The OFT, however, also optimistically identified a number of ways in which \n\u2018emerging market forces may in practice address the problems, without the need for \nregulatory intervention\u2019. A decade later, the benefits of such a light touch may well be being \nfelt in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Delaware. \nDeal or No Deal? \nThe practices of publishers impact on higher education in two ways. First, actions like those \nof Informa deprive the UK Treasury of tax revenues and thus contribute to the \u2018fiscal crisis of \nthe state\u2019 which has led to the squeeze on public funding for universities. Second, \npublishers\u2019 pricing policies have a direct and immediate impact on university libraries, and \ntherefore on academics\u2019 and students\u2019 ability to access information and knowledge \u2013 \nknowledge that they, collectively, have produced.  \nOver the past decade, university libraries\u2019 real spending has increased by 31 per cent. But \nwith universities and colleges increasing their expenditure by around 60 per cent over this \nsame period, libraries\u2019 share of this spending has fallen from 3.4 per cent to 2.5 per cent, \nwhilst library spending per student has only risen by 8 per cent, reaching \u00a3416 per student \nper year in 2009 (in 2011 prices).5\nLibraries\u2019 single biggest item of expenditure is on staffing, which takes roughly half of library \nbudgets. After that is \u2018information provision\u2019 \u2212 spending on books and periodicals, both \nprinted and electronic \u2212 which accounts for a little over a third of total spending. This figure \nhas remained roughly constant over the decade, but the balance between books and serials \n(periodicals) has shifted significantly.  \n  \nSince 1999, spending on books has fallen by almost a fifth in real terms, and from almost 12 \nper cent of libraries\u2019 total spending to just over 8 per cent. Expenditure on serials, on the \nother hand, has increased sharply: from just under \u00a370 million to over \u00a3130 million. In real \nterms this represents an increase of 63 per cent; journals\u2019 share of total library spending \nrose from 16 per cent to almost 20 per cent.6\nAccording to other respected observers of the \u2018information provision\u2019 industry, \n \nThese changes are the result in large part of the Big Deals introduced by many \npublishers of scholarly journals, providing access to a wide range of journals in \nelectronic form at a discounted price. Such deals have dramatically increased the \nnumber of titles available in individual universities, and have changed fundamentally \nthe expectations of staff and students. They also involve, however, a contract of \nseveral years\u2019 duration, with an annual price increase. [Our own librarian suggests well \nin excess of RPI, 7 per cent per annum being typical.] Librarians thus find that \n                                                          \n5 All data is taken from RIN\/SCONUL (2010). \n6 Looking just at expenditure on serials, there has been a big shift away from print journals and towards \nelectronic journals. Between 2001 and 2009 print-only journals\u2019 share of serials expenditure has fallen from \n66% to 22%, while electronic-only journal spending now accounts for almost half, up from 10%; spending on \nsubscriptions that provide both printed journals and electronic access has risen slightly, from 25% of serials \nexpenditure to 29%. \nincreasing proportions of their budgets are tied up in big deals, with an inevitable \nimpact upon other budgets, including those earmarked for buying books. \n(RIN\/SCONUL 2010: 14) \nAlthough the Research Information Network (RIN) and the Society of College, National and \nUniversity Libraries (SCONUL) are right to note the impact on the book budget, perhaps \nmore serious is the impact on alternative means of publishing academic journals and \ndisseminating scholarly research.  \nIn 2004, there was a major parliamentary investigation into the operation of the journals \nmarket. The resulting report (House of Commons 2003\u221204) was critical of the pricing \npolicies of major commercial publishers and concluded that \u2018a Government strategy is \nurgently needed\u2019. As an immediate step the report recommended \u2018that all UK higher \neducation institutions establish institutional repositories on which their published output \ncan be stored and from which it can be read, free of charge, online. It also recommended \nthat Research Councils and other Government funders mandate their funded researchers to \ndeposit a copy of all of their articles in this way\u2019. The report\u2019s summary continued, \n\u2018Institutional repositories will help to improve access to journals but a more radical solution \nmay be required in the long term. Early indications suggest that the author-pays publishing \nmodel could be viable. We remain unconvinced by many of the arguments mounted against \nit.\u2019 This report received a cool reception from the government at the time; and although \nresearch archives are now common, their influence in the research-audit culture remains \nmarginal. A key reason for this is no doubt the insistence of established journals upon \nappropriately-paginated referencing of the versions of sources that can be found only in \nrestricted access, rather than to their open-access doppelg\u00e4ngers.   \nGiven these limitations upon the capacity of open repositories to fracture the status quo \nand academics\u2019 and librarians\u2019 widespread dissatisfaction with the still-dominant \ncommercial model and its pricing structure, why aren\u2019t more journals published by scholarly \nsocieties (scholarly\/learned societies publish 30 per cent of all journal articles, with \nuniversity presses publishing a further 4 per cent (Oppenheim\/LISU (2006 p. 41, Table \n1.15))?7 Why don\u2019t more journal editors follow example of Topology\u2019s editorial board, which \nin 2006 resigned en masse in protest at Elsevier\u2019s pricing of the journal, and launched \ninstead Journal of Topology, owned by the London Mathematical Society?8\n                                                          \n7 Commercial publishers, including commercial publishers publishing on behalf of societies, publish 64%. \n Why aren\u2019t more \njournals open-access (around 10 per cent of peer-reviewed journals are currently open-\naccess (Oppenheim\/LISU 2006 p. 20) and a study by Bj\u00f6rk et al. (2010) which searched for \n1837 randomly-selected articles, discovered that \u20188.5% were freely available at the \npublishers' sites. \u2026 [A]n additional 11.9% free manuscript versions could be found using \nsearch engines, making the overall OA percentage 20.4%\u2019)?  \n8 See Jackson (2007) \nPart of the answer lies in the big deals outlined above, which leave individual journals as the \nonly possible candidates for cuts in library budgets. Another part may reside in the apathy of \nacademics and the gap between their traditional skill set and that of the publicist\/publisher, \ntogether with the additional time and costs that must be borne should editors choose a \nroute such as that developed by ephemera. But that is probably not the whole story and the \nvenality of extant providers goes some way to filling the final gap. We explore further \nanecdotal accounts of publishers\u2019 behaviour in the face of challenges to their hegemony to \nreveal just how parlous our state of things is. \nChallenging the Indefensible \nOne of us used to be the editor of a Taylor and Francis journal. The journal has been \npublished for over 15 years (not all of them with Taylor and Francis) and has recently been \naccepted for Thomson ISI listing, a virtue that almost inevitably enhances both impact factor \nand position of various research ranking lists. On discovering the egregious tax avoiding \npractices of Taylor and Francis\u2019s parent, Informa, the editors decided to explore alternative \nroutes to market. Our initial approach was to another publisher, one which to be sure is still \nmaking the sorts of supranormal profits seen throughout the sector but one which has at \nleast thus far not been tempted to take a tax sabbatical. One of the reasons for doing this \nwas in an attempt to maintain the valuable ISI listing, for more radical action such as that \nengaged in by our topologists would have meant starting again from scratch in terms of \nsecuring this kitemark. The other reason was to try to ascertain the \u2018value\u2019 of the outlet to \nthe industry by encouraging the current publishers to name their price in the transfer \nnegotiations. This move itself was prompted by prior frustration with the woefully limited \neditorial support available from the journal\u2019s coffers, something in the order of \u00a32,000 per \nyear for a part-time editorial assistant. Previous attempts to get this contribution uplifted \nhad been confronted with, in the light of our account above, laughable stories of the tight \neconomics of the journal publishing business, with the only change we could eventually \nengineer in level of support being attendant upon agreement to increase the page budget \nand number of issues and hence the subscriptions commandable. However, it quickly \nbecame clear to us that journals are a bit like Premiership footballers in terms of their \ntransferability. The publisher who we had interested in taking the journal on reported that \nthey could not \u2018legally\u2019 make an approach to the current publisher to begin negotiations on \nthis because such was only acceptable if and when the current publisher had clearly \ncommunicated a desire to sell in the absence of prior approach. And, as we have been \nreminded only too often as editors, we have no intellectual property rights whatsoever in \nthe organs we realise through our unpaid labour.  Such resides in its entirety with the \npublisher and the publisher alone, a situation that thankfully does not beset those outlets \nwhose delivery to market is orchestrated by learned societies.  \nOur question, which we set out in the title to this paper, was what are we to do with feral \npublishers? The Cats Protection charity, in attempting to control the feline population, has a \npolicy of capturing feral cats, neutering them, and then re-releasing them into the wild. \nWould that we could do the same with our publishers. Instead, it is the academic \ncommunity \u2013 academics, students, libraries \u2013 that has been captured and seemingly \nneutered, leaving publishers to run amok. \nAt a time when the public sector is being forced to cut savagely, pruning jobs and services, \nthe increasing profits being gouged from shrinking academic budgets by the parasitical \npublishing industry are hard to stomach. But even within that scabrous community, Informa \nappears to have set a new marker in displaying its contempt, seeking to minimize  its \ncontribution to the sector that provides the majority of its profits.9\nInforma\u2019s tax-dodging actions are perhaps the most visibly callous but that does not excuse \nother publishers, including Sage. We call upon the editors of Organization to press Sage to \nlower the subscription price to a more acceptable level \u2013 such as the \u00a3123 charged for the \nAMJ or the \u00a3182 for ASQ. When that approach fails, as past experiences of discussions with \ncommercial publishers on the issue of price indicate it inevitably will, we suggest that the \neditors, writers and readers of Organization follow the example set by Topology in leaving \nthe journal en masse to set up, submit to and subscribe to an identical journal, ideally \nthrough a learned society, that charges a more acceptable fee. This is not only more \nappropriate for a journal that wears a critical badge, however lightly, but also provides \nrenaming opportunities that would delight a hairdresser.  \n We therefore suggest \nthat the only reasonable response is to demand that Informa repay the tax that it has looted \nfrom the system. If it fails to do so, then it becomes hard to see how or why we should \nrespect their intellectual property. At one level, this merely means refusing to use Routledge \nand Taylor and Francis journals \u2013 either as an outlet for our academic labour or as a \nresource in teaching and scholarship. More basely, we should perhaps consider offering \nsupport, even if only verbal, to those who would more freely distribute their copyrighted \nmaterial.    \n \nReferences \nBergstrom, Carl and Bergstrom, Ted (2004) \u2018The Costs and Benefits of Library Site Licenses \nto Academic Journals\u2019, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 101, \n897\u2013902.  \nBj\u00f6rk, Bo-Christer; Welling, Patrik; Laakso, Mikael; Majlender, Peter; Hedlund, Turid; and \nGu\u00f0naso, Gu\u00f0ni (2010), \u2018Open Access to the Scientific Journal Literature: Situation 2009\u2019, \nPLoS ONE.
