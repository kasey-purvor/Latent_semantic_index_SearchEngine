Fewer have considered the impacts on\nthe performance of the irrigation distribution system itself\nand the required adaptations in engineering design and\nmanagement. Daccache and Lamaddalena (2010) found\nthat the pipe cost of a large water distribution system\n(District 4 of the Sinistra Ofanto scheme) would increase\nby 20\u201327% if designed according to the future irrigation\ndemand. P\u00e9rez Urrestarazu et al (2010) concluded that the\npumping capacity of the Fuente Palmera district (Spain)\nrequired for future demands would be difficult to satisfy.\nThis study considers the impacts and potential\nadaptations for a typical pressurized pipe irrigation\nsystem taking District 8 of the Sinistra Ofanto scheme\n(southern Italy) as a case study.\nIrrigation infrastructure such as reservoirs and water\ndistribution systems has played an important role in\nimproving the agricultural productivity in arid and semi-\narid regions and in benefiting the socioeconomic\ndevelopment of rural areas. Irrigated lands have\nexpanded and new crops have been cultivated, while the\nyields and quality of traditional crops have improved.\nCompared with open channels, pressurized water\ndistribution networks have many advantages, especially\nunder arid and semi-arid conditions such as those in the\nsouth of Italy. These systems greatly reduce the water\nlosses by evaporation and percolation during\ntransportation. They help avoid uncontrolled water\nwithdrawal. They can provide an easily metered,\npressurized water service to each hydrant, and\nconsequently are able to support a water pricing system\nbased on the volume of water consumed by each user\n(Lamaddalena and Sagardoy, 2000).\nIn contrast to rotational supply, on-demand delivery\nschedules allow farmers to access water whenever and as\noften as required, depending on water availability. On-\ndemand supply is highly desired by farmers since it\nallows them greater flexibility in managing their\nbusinesses. Apart from the high capital cost, the main\noperational problem of these systems is pressure\nfluctuation in the pipes, caused by continual changes in\nthe number and locations of the opened hydrants. A\nfluctuation at the upstream end of an on-farm network\n(that is, at the hydrant) can affect the uniformity and the\namount of water applied in both drip and sprinkler\nsystems (Daccache et al, 2010a, 2010b). Pressurized\nirrigation networks are normally designed and sized to\noperate at a given minimum hydrant pressure. For an on-\ndemand system, the total discharge is calculated for a\nmaximum number of opened hydrants, based on\nstatistical parameters. However, in the peak demand\nperiod, the discharge flowing in the network can exceed\nthe design discharge, putting the operational performance\nof the system at risk. The peak demand discharge depends\non the cropping pattern and farmers\u2019 irrigation practices,\nbut also on the meteorological conditions. The climate of\nsouthern Italy is expected to become warmer and drier,\naccording to climate change projections, and the peak\nwater needed for a given cropping pattern will increase.\nThe aim of this research is to examine how resilient a\nFigure 1. Mean monthly rainfall and reference\nevapotranspiration (ETo) for 1970\u201390 at the study site.\ntypical pressurized irrigation water distribution network\nis to such increases. Peak discharges were quantified\nunder baseline and future climate conditions, initially\nassuming an unchanged cropping pattern. The reliability\nof each hydrant to deliver the appropriate pressure head\nfor the on-farm network was then evaluated, and the\nresilience of the system to the increase in peak demand\nflow was analysed. Based on the results from this type of\nanalysis, irrigation district managers can then develop\nengineering or managerial adaptation action plans to\navoid, minimize or simply cope with future failures of\nthese types of water distribution systems.\nStudy site\nThe Apulia region (southern Italy) has a typical semi-arid\nMediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers\nand mild, wet winters. The largest water deficit\n(evapotranspiration\u2013rain) occurs during the summer\nmonths (Figure 1) and coincides with the maximum\ncanopy development of most of the crops grown in the\narea. The winter flow of the Ofanto River is diverted and\nstored in the Capaciotti Dam reservoir, which has a\nmaximum storage capacity of 48 million m3 intended to\nirrigate the lowlands of the Sinistra Ofanto scheme\n(Figure 2). The water volume accumulated in the reservoir\ndepends greatly on the dryness or wetness of each year.\nFrom the Capaciotti Dam, water is then conveyed to five\naccumulation and compensation reservoirs that serve\nseven irrigation districts (Figure 2). From the reservoirs\nright down to the on-farm systems, water is distributed\nby means of pipes and pressurized only by gravity.\nDistrict 8 was chosen for the study. The reservoir\nsupplying District 8 has a storage capacity of 26,000 m3,\nwith maximum and minimum water levels of 102 m and\n98 m above sea level (asl) respectively. The irrigation\ndistrict is designed to satisfy 2,856 ha of irrigated lands\nmainly occupied by grapes (54%), olive trees (28%), fruit\ntrees (10%), tomatoes and small vegetables. Being\ndominated by deep-rooted and permanent crops, the\ncropping pattern of the district shows a limited inter-\nannual change, while the actual area irrigated and the\nvolume applied each year are dependent on both the\nm\nm\nETo\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nJan   Feb  Mar   Apr   May  Jun   Jul   Aug  Sep   Oct  Nov   Dec\nRainfall\n279Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 39, No 4\nPressurized irrigation water distribution networks\nFigure 2.

Drip irrigation is the only application\nmethod used in the district. Despite their high capital\ncost, drip systems fit well into these semi-arid conditions\nwhere water is scarce, labour is expensive and frequent\nirrigation is needed.\nMaterial and methods\nIn summary, a weather generator was calibrated for the\nobserved baseline weather (1970\u201390) and used with the\noutputs of a global climate model (GCM) to generate a\nfuture synthetic weather dataset for two emissions\nscenarios (Figure 3). The historical (1970\u201390) and future\n(2050s) irrigation needs of the main crops grown in the\ndistrict were then computed using a daily water balance\nmodel. For the present cropping pattern, the historical\nand future peak water demands at the upstream end of\nthe distribution system were identified. These were then\nused in a stochastic hydraulic simulation model to\nevaluate the level of failure or success of the system in\ndelivering the required pressure heads at the hydrant\nlevel under a range of open hydrant permutations. Hence\nfor every peak water demand, the reliability of each\nhydrant in delivering the desired pressure head was\nidentified.\nGeneration of future weather\nThe nearest weather station to the study site (lat: 41\u00b013\u2019N,\nlong: 16\u00b0 4\u2019 E and alt: 140 m asl) had only temperature and\nrainfall data available from 1970 to 1987, but a complete\nclimate dataset from 1987 onwards. The Penman\u2013\nMonteith method is recommended as the international\nstandard to calculate reference evapotranspiration (ETo)\nin both humid and arid environments (Smith, 2000), but\nrequires a complete climate dataset, while the empirical\nformula of Hargreaves\u2013Samani (1982) needs only\nminimum and maximum temperatures. To overcome the\nproblem of missing data, the Penman\u2013Monteith and\nHargreaves\u2013Samani methods were both used to calculate\nFigure 3.

The\ncorrelation between ETo values obtained with the two\nmethods was then used to adjust the ETo values of\nHargreaves\u2013Samani (1982) for the historical baseline\nperiod (1970\u201390).\nA LARS-WG stochastic weather generator (Semenov\nand Barrow, 1997) was used to produce daily weather\nfrom GCM outputs at a single site. LARS-WG utilizes\nsemi-empirical distributions for the lengths of wet and\ndry day series, daily precipitation and daily solar\nradiation (Racsko et al, 1991). The observed weather data\nare analysed to determine their statistical characteristics.\nThese are used to generate synthetic weather data having\nthe same statistical characteristics as the original observed\ndata, but differing on a day-to-day basis. Synthetic data\ncorresponding to a particular future climate change\nscenario are generated by applying global climate model-\nderived changes in precipitation, temperature and solar\nradiation to the LARS-WG parameter files.\nThe HadCM3 (Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version\n3) was chosen for this study since it was one of the major\nmodels used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange (IPCC) Third Assessment Report. HadCM3 is a\ncoupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model\ndeveloped at the Hadley Centre and has a spatial\nresolution of 2.5\u00b0 \u00d7 3.75\u00b0. The emissions scenarios used are\nthose developed by the IPCC (Nakicenovic et al, 2000) in\nwhich each scenario combines two sets of divergent\ntendencies: one set varying between strong economic\nvalues and strong environmental values, the other set\nvarying between increasing globalization and increasing\nregionalization (IPCC-TGCIA, 1999). In this work, the A1\nand B1 emissions scenarios were used; both are\ncharacterized by a rapid economic growth and a global\npopulation that reaches nine billion in 2050 and then\ngradually declines. The A1 scenario characterizes a future\nwith energy technology balanced between fossil and non-\nfossil fuel, whilst the B1 scenario reflects global efforts to\ncontrol greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the\nintroduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies.\nIrrigation demand\nThe irrigation demand for the main crops grown in the\nirrigation district was computed using the WaSim daily\nsoil water balance model (Graves et al, 2002). The local\nirrigation practices on olive trees and vineyards, such as\nscheduling to improve yield quality rather than quantity,\nwere taken into account. Numerous researchers (Ciollaro\net al, 1993; Di Chio, 1997; and Khadra, 2004) have\npreviously noticed that water consumption in the Sinistra\nOfanto scheme is lower than required for fully meeting\nwater stress, confirming that deficit irrigation is widely\npractised in that area. The monthly water demand\nrequired to satisfy the irrigation needs of the present\ncropping pattern was identified by the WaSim model for\neach year (baseline and future). This provided the peak\nupstream discharge for the hydraulic modelling,\nexpressed in l.s\u20131.\nHydraulic modelling\nAs the volume of water flowing in the pipe system\nincreases, the friction losses increase, reducing the\npressure head at the hydrants. In networks operating on\ndemand, the friction losses are distributed in the system\naccording to the number and location of the opened\nhydrants. This will cause a certain level of pressure\nfluctuation at each hydrant that can cause a system failure\nunder peak demand (Lamaddalena et al, 2007). The\nCOPAM model (Lamaddalena and Sagardoy, 2000) is a\nstochastical simulation model that generates a large\nnumber of random configurations of hydrants\nsimultaneously open to simulate the range of possible\noperating conditions of the on-demand system at a given\nupstream discharge. For each configuration, the pipeline\nsystem performance is resolved based on the continuity\nprinciple at junctions and standard friction formulae, and\nthe amount of pressure at the hydrants is obtained. A\nhydrant is considered satisfied only when the pressure is\nhigher than the minimum pressure (Hmin) required for\nappropriate functioning of the on-farm network and\nfailure.\nThe hydrant reliability described by Hashimoto et al\n(1982) was used in this study to describe the failure\nprobability of each hydrant in the system. The reliability\nindicator (Lamaddalena and Sagardoy, 2000) is\nsummarized as:\n             C\u03a3\nr=1 Ihj,rIpj,r\n\u03b1j = \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n                   \nC\n\u03a3\nr=1Ihj,r\nwhere:\n\u03b1j = reliability of the hydrant, j\nIhj,r = 1 if the hydrant, j, is open in the configuration, r\nIhj,r = 0 if the hydrant, j, is closed in the configuration, r\nIpj,r = 1 if the pressure head at the hydrant, j, open in the\nconfiguration, r, is higher than the minimum pressure\nhead (Hmin)\nIpj,r = 0 if the pressure head at the hydrant, j, open in the\nconfiguration, r, is lower than the minimum pressure\nhead (Hmin)\nC = total number of configurations generated\nFor each configuration, the pressure head (m) at each\noperating hydrant is calculated and consequently the\nindexes Ihj,r and Ipj,r are obtained. Once the satisfaction\nprobability \u03b1j for each hydrant j in the system is\ncalculated, the critical hydrants are then identified and\nmapped to highlight the failure zones in the district.\nResults and discussion\nIrrigation requirement\nThe average historical (1970\u201390) and projected future\nirrigation needs (2050s) for the study site for the IPCC A1\nand B1 emissions scenarios are presented in Figure 4. The\nerror bars represent the range of variation in irrigation\nrequirements caused by the annual change in climatic\nconditions. In other words, these bars reflect the range of\ndryness and wetness during that specific time period. The\nfuture irrigation requirements for the major crops grown\nin the district noticeably increase, with only minor\ndifferences between the two emissions scenarios. For\ntomatoes and fruit trees, the future projections show that\nthe wettest years in the 2050s will be drier than the driest\n281Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 39, No 4\nPressurized irrigation water distribution networks\nFigure 4.

For the other\ncrops, the future wettest years will correspond to the\naverage or even to the dry years of the baseline period.\nClimate change, according to these results, will seriously\naffect an agricultural sector that is already struggling to\ncompete with other users in the region for scarce water\nresources.\nAssuming the same irrigated cropping pattern, an\nincrease in irrigation demand implies an increase in the\nvolume of water flowing through the pipe system. The\nhistorical and future peak demand discharges were\nidentified by the WaSim model for every year and\nexpressed as a probability of exceedance (Figure 5). For\nthe baseline, the peak water demand to satisfy the\ndistrict\u2019s crops ranges between 1,000 l.s\u20131 (1984) and\n1,575 l.s\u20131 (1981). In the 2050s, the peak discharge shows\nonly a minor change between the two emission scenarios,\nFigure 6. Percentage of unsatisfied hydrants (H < 20 m) with 80%\noccurrence probability at different upstream discharges. Error\nbars show the range of variation caused by the different configu-\nrations of opened hydrants.\nand fluctuates, according to the dryness or wetness of the\nyear, between 1,150 l.s\u20131 and 1,880 l.s\u20131. The highest peak\nwater demand in the baseline period (1,575 l.s\u20131) will be\nexceeded for 80% of the time in the 2050s.\nSystem performance\nAs previously mentioned, a hydrant is considered\nunsatisfied when its pressure head is lower than the\nminimum required (Hmin). Up to a discharge of 1,500 l.s\u20131,\nthe system will perform adequately, as fewer than 10% of\nthe system\u2019s hydrants have less than 20% probability to\nfail at peak demand period. The high cost of providing\nlarger pipes justifies this small failure level in the system.\nAs the peak demand discharge increases, the number of\nhydrants with pressure head lower than 20 m increases\n(Figure 6). At a discharge higher than 2,100 l.s\u20131, a large\nfraction of the system might fail as the minimum pressure\nrequired would not be met in more than 50% of the\nsystems\u2019 hydrants at peak demand.\nTo identify the zones where the hydrants are most\nsusceptible to failure, the district was analysed at two\ndifferent discharges \u2013 1,360 l.s\u20131 and 1,720 l.s\u20131 \u2013\ncorresponding to average peak demand for the baseline\nand 2050s periods respectively. Figure 7 shows the\nreliability of each hydrant at peak demand in an average\nyear for the baseline and future (2050s). The number of\nhydrants that are less than 85% reliable is expected to\nincrease from 14 (2%) to 115 (18%) and those that are\nhighly reliable (>95%) to drop from 569 (90%) to 449\n(71%). The most affected hydrants are those located at the\nfar downstream end of the system and those located on\nelevated lands for both periods.\nAdaptation and mitigation\nIn response to this expected worsening of system\nperformance, managers and farmers will need to adapt\nnow or in the future through engineering and\/or\nmanagerial changes. Engineering solutions are often\nconsidered first as they are the easiest for managers to\ncontrol. Appropriate maintenance of the system could\nreduce the pipe leakage as well as friction losses from old\nB\na\ns\ne\nlin\ne\n \n2\n0\n5\n0\nB\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\nA\n1\nB\na\ns\ne\nlin\ne\n \n2\n0\n5\n0\nB\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\nA\n1\nB\na\ns\ne\nlin\ne\n \n2\n0\n5\n0\nB\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\nA\n1\nB\na\ns\ne\nlin\ne\n \n2\n0\n5\n0\nB\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\nA\n1\nB\na\ns\ne\nlin\ne\n \n2\n0\n5\n0\nB\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\nA\n1\nTomato Olive Fruit trees Vineyards Vegetables\nIr\nri\ng\na\nti\no\nn\n n\ne\ne\nd\n (\nm\nm\n)\n700\n650\n600\n550\n500\n450\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n100   90     80    70    60    50    40    30    20    10     0 \nProbability of exceedance (%)\nP\ne\na\nk\n d\nis\nc\nh\na\nrg\ne\n (\nl.\ns\n\u2013\n1\n)\nBaseline 2050B1 2050A1\n2,000\n1,750\n1,500\n1,250\n1,000\n750\n500\n250\n0\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1,200 1,400 1,600 1,800 2,000 2,200 2,400 2,600 2,800 3,000\nUpstream discharge (l.s\u20131)\n%\n o\nf \nu\nn\ns\na\nti\ns\nfi\ne\nd\n h\ny\nd\nra\nn\nts\n282 Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 39, No 4\nPressurized irrigation water distribution networks\nFigure 7.

Increasing the pipe diameters to reduce\nfriction losses once problems arise would be an expensive\nsolution, though judicious dualling of critical pipelines\ncan be effective. Using larger pipes at the design stage\nwould usually be cheaper, but implies a significant extra\ncost well before the climate change effects become serious,\nand indeed while the impacts may still be uncertain or\neven disputed. More simply, at a later stage and as\nneeded, the upstream piezometric head could be\nincreased to overcome the increased friction losses in the\npipe system. The characteristic curve of District 8 (Figure\n8) shows the upstream piezometric head required at each\npeak demand discharge to satisfy all the hydrants at least\n80% of the time. A pump at the intake could therefore be\nused to raise the piezometric head in response to water\ndemand increases. Alternatively, smaller booster pumps\ncould be used at critical hydrants or failure zones when\nrequired. However, both these options imply future pump\nand energy costs in what is currently a gravity-fed system.\nNon-engineering-based solutions are more difficult to\nimplement, and less efficient if not well managed, but less\ncapital-intensive. The district managers could face the\nreduction in performance of these systems by reducing\nwater consumption. Efficient use of water at the farm\nlevel by applying the minimum water in the right place at\nthe right time must be a priority. This could be obtained\nthrough more efficient on-farm irrigation systems and\nappropriate irrigation scheduling. District managers\nusually do not have the power to intervene directly in\nfarmer operations, but water saving could be encouraged\nby appropriate water pricing based on water\nconsumption, extension services (technical training,\nmeteorological services) and allocation of limited water\nvolumes to each user. The use of low-energy precise\napplication (LEPA) irrigation systems is also an option for\nhydrants subject to high risk of pressure failure. Managers\ncould also restrict water use with electronic \u2018credit card\u2019\ndevices known as AquaCards limiting the operation of the\nhydrants with high failure risk at peak demand periods,\nand then re-activating them during off-peak periods (that\nis, at night). This latter option could reduce the burden of\nnight-time irrigation if coupled with modern automated\nirrigation systems.\nSectoring of the system at peak demand periods has\nbeen used elsewhere to reduce the energy consumption\nand the risk of system failure. This option modifies the\ndelivery schedule from an on-demand to a rotational\noperation, and thus reduces the operational freedom of\nthe farmers. This practice does not necessarily achieve\nwater saving and in certain conditions it can lead to\nincreased demand and over-irrigation (Lamaddalena et al,\n1995). This latter issue, combined with the fact that\nopened hydrants of a given sector are usually concen-\ntrated in the same network branch, means that the friction\nlosses caused by the concentrated water volume flowing\nin that branch may aggravate the performance of the\nsystem. Finally, the cultivation of drought-tolerant\nvarieties or the adoption of new water-saving techniques\nsuch as partial root drying, subsurface irrigation, deficit\nirrigation and mulching are potential farmer adaptations.\nConclusions\nFuture climate projections for Mediterranean Italy show a\nnoticeable increase in summer evapotranspiration and\nhence in crop irrigation requirements. Consequently,\nfarmers are expected to increase their demands on water,\nincreasing the load for on-demand water distribution\nsystems. During peak demand periods, the discharge\nflowing in the system may exceed the design discharge of\nthe system, causing insufficient pressure head at the\nhydrant level, which can adversely affect the performance\nof the on-farm irrigation system.
