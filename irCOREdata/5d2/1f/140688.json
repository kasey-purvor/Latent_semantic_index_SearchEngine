Many theories of\nbuyer-seller relationships have discussed in general terms the concept of structural bonds and opportunism, but\nnot adequately applied them to the extreme situation of monopoly buyer and monopoly seller relationships. We\nfirst summarise the difficulties faced by the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) and its major industrial suppliers in\nmoving away from traditional, adversarial relationships whilst facing increasingly monopolistic business\ndealings. We then justify the use of a Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) model as a theoretical lens through\nwhich to view the problem. Interdisciplinarity is a radically different approach that combines two or more\ndisciplines to produce an outcome that is more than the sum of the parts (Starkey & Madan, 2001). Because the\nnature of the business is Supply Chain Management (SCM), Relationship Marketing (RM) provides an effective\nframework for describing business-to-business relationships and, TCE describes the contractual arrangements of\nprocurement, this paper argues that concepts from these fields can be used to address the problems identified\nwhen viewed through the TCE theoretical lens. The authors describe an exploratory research programme\nwithin the Sea, Land and Air elements of the UK Defence Procurement (DP) environment and present findings\nwhich not only expand our knowledge of the business area in question but also provide a better understanding of\nthe relational dynamics of sustained monopolies.\nUK Defence Procurement\nHistorically, the relationship between the UK MoD and the UK Defence Industries has been adversarial. On\none hand, with estimated equipment procurement expenditure of \u00a310,162 million in 2000\/01 (DASA, 2001), the\n3UK MoD has immense power as British industry\u2019s largest single customer. It can thus determine the \u2018size,\nstructure, conduct, ownership and performance of the industry through pricing, profitability, technical progress\nand exports\u2019 (Hartley 1998). On the other hand, industry is a major exporter and contributor to the UK\u2019s\nbalance of payments, its production for foreign sales reduces UK MoD\u2019s equipment unit costs, it develops\nstrategically important technologies such as aero engines and is a significant employer in UK industrial areas.\nHowever, the major UK Defence companies are virtual domestic monopolies and can team with foreign\ncompanies to reduce the choice of supplier. The UK MoD\/industrial supplier relationship is thus dominated by\na monopoly market in which each side wields considerable power but where lack of trust and the option to leave\noften reduces efficiency, increases costs and offers little incentive to co-operate (Humphries & Wilding, 2001c,\nPalmer, 2001, Parker & Hartley 1997). Against this background, the UK Government stated that its Smart\nAcquisition initiative depended heavily on partnership in order to reap the benefits of competition and\ncollaboration (Cm 4446, 1999). It is this challenging and potentially mutually exclusive business objective that\ndrives a need for research in this area.\nThe Monopoly Environment\nIn our search of the literature for a suitable model with which to examine the relationship conditions within a\nmonopoly, we first considered 2 relationship power perspectives. Michael Porter\u2019s (1980) five forces model of\ncompetitive advantage considers business relationships are characterised by a short-term orientation, arms-\nlength competition and the exercise of market power (Rugman & D\u2019Cruz, 2000). However, although\nparticipants may aim to achieve market dominance by limiting competition through the creation of barriers to\nentry, this does not accurately represent UK DP monopolies where equally powerful \u2018partners\u2019 can be locked in\na relationship from which neither can escape. Alternative by Andrew Cox (2000) see the combination of\nresource utility and scarcity creating a power regime in which the involved parties will employ adversarial\/non-\nadversarial and arms-length\/collaborative arrangements depending on their relative power positions as shown in\nthe matrix at Figure 1.\n4Quadrant I suggests limited information, resource sharing and the buyer\/supplier aiming to obtain a greater\nshare of the exchange value. In quadrant II a long-term, balanced relationship is sought where there is little\nsharing of specific assets but both parties gain some strategic benefit. In quadrant III, the parties work closely\ntogether and share sensitive information and costly resources. However, the dominant partner intends to take a\ndisproportionate share of the returns. In quadrant IV, both sides enjoy a close, collaborative, equal arrangement,\noften called a \u2018partnership\u2019. This approach offers a clear perspective on the appropriate use of power within a\nbusiness relationship however, in a sustained monopoly, where neither party has choice over the selection of\nrelationship strategy and where equality of power really means equally disempowered, the Relationship Power\nAnalysis matrix does not provide a robust framework for extending thinking on long-term, monopoly\nrelationships.\nIn a review of the contracting and TCE literatures, we noted that when the cost of managing the risk associated\nwith human factors such as opportunism became too high, the market could break down and force a firm to\ninternalise the business, in effect creating an internal monopoly (Faulkner & de Rond, 2000). However, TCE\ngenerally treats monopoly as a short-term, highly undesirable market aberration that would normally be dealt\nwith by government anti-trust regulation (Williamson, 1996). We have nevertheless adapted Oliver\nWilliamson\u2019s (1975) Economic Organisation Failure Framework in Figure 2 to describe the environment that\ncreates and sustains a monopolistic relationship rather as a causal model and, borne in mind that for the majority\nof major contracts in UK DP, monopoly is considered to be in the public interest (Fishwick, 1993).\nFigure 1.

In 1985 the Levene reforms ended MoD\u2019s \u2018cosy relationship\u2019 with industry (Hartley, 1998) and\nintroduced uncertainty and complexity into the market (Humphries & Wilding, 2000). In seeking to obtain\npublic expenditure value for money the UK MoD attempts to drive down industry\u2019s profit to a \u2018reasonable\u2019 level\nand in turn the contractor attempts to inflate the view of his costs to maximise his rate of return. This deliberate\nobfuscation is information impactedness (selective information disclosures, and distortions which are difficult or\nexpensive to verify at the time and which undermine the durability of contract arrangements) (Liston-Heyes,\n1995). The consequences are that industry loses its incentive to perform better and, the UK MoD reduces the\nresources available to industry that might have been used to fund important Research and Development. This is\nbounded rationality where personal capacity to rationalise complexity limits performance to the adequate rather\nthan the optimum (Simon, 1957). The sum effect is an adversarial relationship without the freedom to look to\nthe market for alternatives (Parker & Hartley, 1997) and the formation of small numbers\/monopoly situation.\nAlthough the authors can find no empirical research using Williamson's (1975) Framework in similar\ncircumstances, it seems to have face validity in the UK DP situation (Humphries & Wilding, 2001c). We have\ntherefore decided to use it as the theoretical basis on which to investigate this unusual situation. We now turn to\na critical review of the theoretical fields; SCM, RM and TCE to determine the extent to which their business-to-\nBounded\nRationality\nUncertainty\/\nComplexity\nInformation\nImpactedness\nOpportunism Small Numbers\nonly do what you\ncan control\ndeliberately\nconfuse your\npartner\nthe partners are\ntrapped by\nlimited choices\neveryone\nfocuses on his\nown objectives\ntake a short term\nview and avoid\nrisks\nFigure 2.

Increased customer service reliability and reduced\ninventory (Boddy et al, 2000) aim to lower uncertainty and lower costs (Cooper & Ellram, 1993, Lamming,\n1993, Bechtel & Jayaram, 1997). SCM depends upon co-operative relationships throughout the Supply Chain in\norder to achieve benefits for all participants (Stevens, 1989) and this involves closer relationships between\nmembers which include trust, commitment and collaboration (Spekman et al, 1998). The literature contains a\ngreat deal of holistic advice on how this should be achieved but, in practice it is generally operationalised as the\nintegration of chains of suppliers to better satisfy customers (Christopher, 1997, Peck et al, 2000). Although\nsuppliers recognise the need to integrate with their customers, empirical research on modelling and studying\nend-to-end Supply Chain relationships is limited (Cooper et al, 1997, Bectel & Jayaram, 1997). It is also\napparent that full SCM implementation is not being achieved for other reasons (Spekman et al, 1998). The\nimportance of long-term partnering relationships to focussing on complex, problem solving (Boddy et al, 2000,\nHulme, 1997) is acknowledged. Also is the need to base them on openness, shared risks and rewards that\nleverage the skills of each partner to achieve competitive performance not achieved by the individual (Lambert\net al, 1996). However, firms are still taking a short-term view which tends them towards adversarial\nrelationships (Braithwaite, 1998) and the development of partnering relationships is being obstructed by poor\ncommunications allied to a reluctance to accept attitudinal change (Anscombe & Kearney, 1994). Nevertheless,\nthe obligational nature of these arrangements to overcome opportunistic temptations is evident (Ellram & Edis,\n1996) as is the importance of achieving good business-to-business relationships through partnering as a\nfoundation for achieving the operational benefits of SCM is clearly identified (Cooper et al, 1997). In\nconclusion, SCM theory appears to be well known by academia and business but research is limited on practical\nimplementation. Furthermore, this research has concentrated on the Private Sector and sheds no light on\nmonopolistic supply chain relationships of the UK DP type (Humphries & Wilding, 2001c).\nRelationships within Relationship Marketing\nRM aims to establish, develop and maintain successful relational exchanges which involves designing and\nnegotiating strategic partnerships with vendors and technology partners through which the firm deploys its\ndistinctive competencies to serve market opportunities (Webster, 1992). The literature thus covers a very wide\n7field and tends to lack consistency and also in some areas, depth (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2000). Research\nhas tended to concentrate on vendor\/retailer rather than vendor\/end customer relationships (Ganesan, 1994) and\nthis has resulted in limited modelling of complete relationship chains (McDonald et al, 1997, Rousseau et al,\n1998). Despite these drawbacks RM provides comprehensive views of the various styles used by firms and\nindividuals when they do business with each other \u2013 the social relations that shape and define the nature of\nsynergistic interactions between firms (Madhok, 2000). Organisationally, the complexity of business\nrelationships within networks from Dyadic (Anderson et al, 1994) through Interactionist (Metcalf et al, 1992) to\nthe Marriage Analogy (Dwyer et al, 1987, Tuten & Urben, 2001) and Key Account Management (McDonald et\nal, 1997) as firms seek closer dealings with a partners to secure reduced uncertainty, managed dependence,\nexchange efficiency and social satisfaction (Gundlach & Murphy, 1993, Gummesson, 1999) is clearly and\nusefully explained. There is also an extensive literature on important behavioural variables which provide\nvaluable guidance on improving business relationships (Evans & Berman, 2001). These include trust (Goleman,\n1998, Kramer, 1999), commitment (Moorman et al, 1992, Morgan & Hunt, 1994, Naude & Buttle, 2000,\nWilson, 1995), co-operative, co-ordinating and collaborative (C3 behaviour) (Axelrod, 1984, Humphries &\nWilding, 2001c, Oliver, 1990, Stern & Reve, 1980), long-term orientation (Oliver, 1990), power (Ganesan,\n1994, Gundlach, 1993, Gummesson, 1999, Hatch, 1997, Tuten & Urban, 2001), adaption (Metcalf et al, 1992),\ninterdependence (Lewin & Johnston, 1997, Mohr & Spekman, 1994) and communication (Morgan & Hunt,\n1994, Moss Kanter, 1994, Tuten & Urban, 2001).\nHowever, the literature reviewed concentrates on commercial companies within \u2018normal\u2019 markets and provides\nlittle insight into monopolistic UK DP relationships (Humphries & Wilding, 2001c).\nRelationships within TCE\nTCE draws upon Law, Economics and Organisation theory as base disciplines and thinking has been dominated\nby Oliver Williamson\u2019s seminal ideas in the field (Gundlach & Murphy, 1993, Williamson, 1975, 1979, 1996).\nTCE concentrates on the need to economise on the cost of transactions including negotiating and enforcing\ncontracts and internal control and management overheads (Faulkner & De Rond, 2000, Palmer, 2001).\nIndividuals are \u2018economic actors\u2019 and theories focus on adopting appropriate forms of governance to minimise\nthe risks associated with opportunistic behaviour (Hill, 1980 2000, Macneil, 1980, Madhok, 2000, Nooteboom,\n1999). Relationship-building includes investments in specific assets (un-recoverables such as time and\nresources) which generate mutual dependence and serve as hostages against opportunism. Williamson (1996)\nbelieved that a farsighted, \u2018calculative\u2019 approach to commercial contracting was required that relied on cost-\n8effective contractual safeguards rather than trust. Although TCE is not a dynamic theory (Besanko et al, 2000),\nit ignores the relational aspects of co-operation such as trust which evolve over time and change the nature of\nthe transactions themselves (Faulkner & De Rond, 2000, Nooteboom, 1999) and, academics have moved away\nin the last 10 years as part of a general trend away from transactional business dealings, TCE continues to\nprovide valid theories on why firms make or buy (Pessali & Fernandez, 1999). However, because of the\ndifficulties of modeling such fundamental aspects of economic exchange there is scant empirical research that\nintegrates TCE concepts (Ghoshal & Moran, 1996, Palmer, 2001) and especially in the UK DP business sector\n(Parker & Hartley, 1997).\nIn trying to understand the exchange motivations within UK DP using TCE theory it is possible to explain small\nnumbers\/monopoly markets (Fishwick, 1993) using the Organisation Failure Framework in Figure 2\n(Williamson, 1975) but only so far as they represent short-term, unnatural phenomena or governance choices\nwithin public utilities (Palmer, 2001, Williamson, 1996). In the stable monopoly situation which prevails in UK\nDP, it appears that contrary to the view that extremes of market conditions will inevitably result in pressures to\nescape (Hirschman, 1970, Parker & Hartley, 1997, Williamson, 1975), the result is an impasse where neither\nside has the power or the motivation to improve the relationship (Parker & Hartley, 1997). In summary, TCE\ntheory is valid for normal markets and short-term, illegal monopolies and falls short where sustained, legal\nmonopolies are concerned.\nThe Research Project\nThe development of SCM, RM and TCE theories appear to have mirrored the approach of the UK MoD and its\nindustrial suppliers such that both see the need for strategic interaction at a relational rather than a transactional\nlevel (CM 4446, 1999). Moreover, they understand they must put aside their traditional approach based upon\nthe \u2018power game\u2019 (Kumar, 1996) and embrace partnering principles base upon trust (Watson, 1999). However,\nimplementing these concepts appears to be extremely difficult, potentially because of the monopolistic aspects\nof their situation. The literature describes a complex suite of business and relationship variables that might\nprovides some clear insights to the improvement of monopolistic relationships within UK DP as long as one is\nwary of those aspects based upon assumptions of free market choice. These are illustrated in Figure 3 where we\nhave juxtaposed a selection of business relationship 'antidotes' to the essentially negative factors in Figure 2.\nGiven the traditionally unsuccessful nature of UK DP relationships, we adopted the positive versions of the\n9following 5 dimensions as a device to pre-dispose the research subjects to consider their situation from a more\nobjective perspective:\n\uf0b7 Bounded Rationality \u2013 relationship development enabling joint creativity.\n\uf0b7 Uncertainty\/Complexity \u2013 relationship stability creating a framework for success.\n\uf0b7 Information Impactedness \u2013 communication creating an environment for business.\n\uf0b7 Opportunism \u2013 relationship reliability creating an effective business arrangement.\n\uf0b7 Small Numbers \u2013 relationship quality creating the incentive to work together.\nwhich form a testable, theoretical framework to use as a basis of an exploratory research strategy to determine if\nit is possible to obtain an understanding of the monopolistic relationships within UK DP using the theoretical\nlens of Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisation Failure Framework and descriptors from SCM, RM and TCE\nrelational and behavioural factors.\nBounded\nRationality\n\uf0b7 Open contracts\n\uf0b7 Joint innovation\n\uf0b7 Stretch targets\n\uf0b7 Dispute resolution\n\uf0b7 Long -termism\nUncertainty\/\nComplexity\n\uf0b7 Fewer partners\n\uf0b7 Mutual objectives\n\uf0b7 Value creation\n\uf0b7 Joint investment\n\uf0b7 Process\nharmonisation\n\uf0b7 Co-operation\n\uf0b7 Co-ordination\n\uf0b7 Collaboration\n\uf0b7 Interdependence\nInformation\nimpactedness\n\uf0b7 KAM\n\uf0b7 Joint Project Teams\n\uf0b7 IS links\n\uf0b7 Business data sharing\n\uf0b7 Performance measurement\n\uf0b7 Technology sharing\n\uf0b7 Communication\n\uf0b7 Adaption\nOpportunism\n\uf0b7 Product quality\n\uf0b7 Delivery reliability\n\uf0b7 IPR clarity\n\uf0b7 Creative conflict\n\uf0b7 Problem-solving\n\uf0b7 Goodwill\n\uf0b7 Trust\n\uf0b7 Commitment\nSmall\nnumbers\n\uf0b7 Shared gains\n\uf0b7 Performance-seeking\n\uf0b7 Dynamic partnership\n\uf0b7 Empowered mutuality\n\uf0b7 Equity\nFigure 3.

Quality\n3. Communication\n10\nA triangulated data capture approach was designed using both quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (semi-\nstructured interview) methods, which aimed to measure perceptions from both relationship sides (Ganesan,\n1994, Jick, 1979). Operationalisation of the research instrument concentrated on the 5 dimensions of the\ntheoretical model in Figure 3 using a 5 point Likert scale (Youngman, 1984) with questions grounded in the\nliterature. The dimensions and 37 questions which achieved a satisfactory 0.7977 level of Coefficient Alpha in\nthe study (Bowman & Ambrosini, 1997) are shown in Appendix 1. The semi-structured interview design\ninvolved following-up the dominant quantitative results by capturing \u2018why\u2019 information from senior managers\nfor each dimension of the relationship in question i.e. what were the key factors that resulted in success or\nfailure? By this additional means it was intended to obtain the richness of perceptions needed to gain insight\ninto the subtleties and cultural depth of the business problem. Time and resource constraints limited the data\ncapture programme to a self-selected census of 54 monopolistic relationships representing \u00a3575.8m annual\nspend (approximately one quarter of the total) within the Sea, Land and Air business units within the Defence\nLogistic Organisation. A total of 629 valid questionnaires were returned and 700 key points were recorded from\n112 interviews. Due to the MoD status of the 1st author, careful attention was paid to ensure that an independent\nstance was maintained and strict impartiality and confidentiality in the handling of data was exercised.\nConclusions from the Statistical Results\nThe high level, quantitative results shown in Figure 4 (the averaged questionnaire satisfaction scores per\ndimension) revealed that contrary to expectations the essentially negative theoretical Organisation Failure\nFramework, there was an overall success rating of 57%.\n1.

The other dimensions \u2013 bounded rationality (59%),\nuncertainty\/complexity (51%), information impactedness (61%) and small numbers (66%) \u2013 were positive.\nThis pattern of results broken down by business unit shown in Figure 5 was reflected in 77.7% of the\nrelationships surveyed and thus indicates a common set of characteristics across the researched UK DP business\nrelationships.\nFigure 5. Comparison of Overall Business Unit Result Patterns.\nIt can thus be concluded that within the selected business environment overall, positive features from the\nselected theoretical fields outweighed the negative aspects and a predictive pattern of results was evident.\nNevertheless, the negative aspects could clearly be seen to emanate from the monopoly environment. The\nresults of overlaying the statistical data with the qualitative data (interview key points) are described next\ntogether with the consequential theoretical deductions.\nImplications for Supply Chain Management Theory\nThe research results found that generally, despite the forced partnership monopolistic situation, the process\nefficiency aims of SCM were prevalent. But, although considerable efforts were being devoted to improving\nSCM performance, in concert with Spekman et al\u2019s (1998) commercial sector findings, successfully\nimplemented examples were few. Moreover, difficulties in achieving effective SCM implementation could be\ntraced to the normal, commercial difficulties surrounding order book performance, joint objectives and service\nlevel systems (Anscombe & Kearney, 1994, Boddy et al, 2000, Braithwaite, 1998, Humphries & Wilding,\n2001c, Lamming, 1993, Spekman et al, 1998,Tompkins, 2000).\nHowever, negative behaviour symptomatic of the theoretical monopoly environment was also clearly\ndiscernible. This included deliberate withholding of supply chain information, insular, non-integrative\nThe 'Ripple Effect'\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\nCr\nea\ntiv\nity\nSt\nab\nilit\ny\nCo\nm\nmu\nnic\nat\nion\nRe\nlia\nbil\nity\nQu\nali\nty\nOv\ner\nall\nDimensions\nP\ne\nrc\ne\nn\nta\ng\ne\nSea\nLand\nAir\nAll\n12\npractices, commercial opportunism, unrealistic performance expectations and unco-operative product strategies.\nIt was strongly evident that endemic DP environmental factors such as old, unreliable products, obsolescence,\nstaff and organisational upheavals, poor end-customer visibility and lack of investment in modern procedures\nand systems accentuated managers\u2019 frustrations due to the lack of freedom of action available within the\nmonopoly. These frustrations then promoted the negative behaviours implied by the theoretical framework.\nThis situation can be illustrated in Figure 6 when Lambert et al\u2019s (1996) Partnering process model is\nspeculatively modified to provide a monopolistic perspective.\nUnder the monopolistic situation the partners have no choice in the arrangement and depending on the degree of\nnegativity affecting the Drivers and Facilitators, will through the Feedback loop, potentially generate a self-\nreinforcing, low quality relationship. We thus conclude that the use of Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisation\nFailure Framework as a model when matched to SCM relational concepts has enabled new insights into\nsustained monopolistic business relationships to be revealed.\nFeedback\nto Components,\nDrivers &\nFacilitators\nDrivers\ncompelling\nreasons to\npartner\nOutcomes\nthe extent to which\nperformance meets\nexpectations\nFacilitators\nsupportive\nenvironmental\nfactors that enhance\npartnership growth\nDecision to\ncreate or adjust\npartnership\nComponents\njoint activities &\nprocesses that build\nand sustain the\npartnership\nFigure 6.

Furthermore,\nefforts had been made to forge improved relationships of a dyadic nature (Anderson et al, 1994, Dwyer et al,\n1987, Metcalf et al, 1992, Tuten & Urben, 2001). But, it was found that the lack of network dynamics due to\nthe monopoly environment had often reduced the effectiveness of attempts to discover \u2018common ground\u2019 on\nwhich to establish \u2018embeddedness\u2019 and provided a lack of incentive to dispel adversarial practices (Humphries\n& Wilding, 2001c). The Marriage Analogy (Gudlach & Murphy, 1993, Gummeson, 1999) has been dismissed\nas imprecise and misleading but, in the UK DP forced dyadic relationships, a much stronger case seems possible\nfor its relevance although a key limitation is the impossibility of \u2018divorce\u2019. The use of key accounts managers\n(McDonald et al, 1997) was almost universal although their success was dependent on personal and cultural\nfactors.\nThe overwhelming majority of respondents placed strong emphasis on personal relationships (\u2018hitting it off\u2019)\nand culture-matching (\u2018relating to the way the other side do things\u2019) on the growth of trust (Gulati, 1995,\nMoorman et al, 1992, Moss Kanter, 1994, Palmer, 2001). This counters the enlightened, self-interest approach\n(Faulkner, 2000, Goleman, 1998, Kumar, 1996, Wilson, 1995). The central importance of commitment and\ntrust to the stability and productiveness of DP business-to-business relationships (Faulkner & de Rond, 2000,\nFrow, 2001, Morgan and Hunt, 1994, Sheth & Sharma, 1997) was also underlined. Excellent, long-term\ncommercial arrangements, frequent, interactive, productive communications, and constructive conflict that\nsupported repeated cycles of exchange, risk-taking and successful fulfilment of expectations were observed.\nThese appeared to strengthen the willingness of parties to rely upon each other (Eisenhardt et al, 1997,\nGoleman, 1998, Lewin & Johnston, 1997, Oliver, 1990, Palmer, 2001). However, opportunistic behaviour such\nas adversarial bidding, inflexible and unduly bureaucratic commercial practices, unwillingness to share\nproprietary data and uncaring use of power which clearly undermined both trust and commitment were also\ndetected. C3 Behaviour, adaption and interdependence were particularly important components in relationship-\nbuilding investment (Doney & Cannon, 1997, Madhok, 2000, Moorman et al, 1992, Rugman & D\u2019Cruz, 2000,\nSheth & Sharma, Stern & Reve, 1980, 1997, Wilson, 1995) but their effectiveness reduced when the sincerity of\nthe other party\u2019s intentions was doubted. Finally, environmental factors such as lack of long-term, stable\n14\nfunding for projects and investment in efficient business systems seemed to exacerbate manager\u2019s negative\nreactions to a lack of freedom to manoeuvre within their monopolistic situation.\nAn illustration that summarises the potential impact of monopoly on trust and commitment is posed in a\nmodified Morgan and Hunts (1994) Commitment-Trust Theory shown in Figure 7.\nThe addition of these negative factors, where it is impossible for the supplier to disengage, might make the\nattainment of the model\u2019s positive outcomes rather more difficult to achieve and they illustrate the greater range\nof positive and negative inputs that potentially affect monopolistic business relationships.\nImplications for Transaction Cost Economics Theory\nWithin UK DP it is possible to envisage the situation in Figure 8 below where both parties become locked in a\n\u2018deadly embrace\u2019, where economic power is lacking, where destructive \u2018competition\u2019 prevents the realisation of\nbenefits and from which there is no escape.\nRelationship\nCommitment\nTrust\nAcquiescence\nPropensity\nto Leave\nCo-operation\nFunctional\nConflict\nUncertaintyOpportunistic\nBehaviour\nCommunication\nShared\nValues\nRelationship\nBenefits\n-\n+\n+ +\n-\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\nFigure 7.

Examples of bounded rationality (Simon, 1957) concerning a lack of\ndetermination to set and observe mutually agreed performance standards and unwillingness to invest in\nspecific relationship-building assets such as joint objective-setting and teamworking were observed\n(Ganesan, 1994). Nevertheless, creative approaches such as open contracts, joint innovation, ensuring\ndisputes were resolved quickly and fairly and taking a long-term view of the relationship were also\ndetected (Beamish & Banks, 1987, Cooper & Ellram, 1993, Van de Ven & Walker, 1984).\n\uf0b7 Uncertainty\/Complexity (51%). Opportunistic, short-termist behaviour such as confusing cheapest for\nvalue for money (Humphries & Wilding, 2001a, Liston-Heyes, 1985) and lack of relationship-developing\nactions such as joint objective setting were observed. These reduced relationship stability and the creation\nof a framework for successful business (Peck et al, 2000). The highly idiosyncratic nature of the business,\nan imbalance in power positions and reduced interdependence because of few credible commitments were\nalso noted (Cooper et al, 1997, Madhok, 2000). On the other hand, the need for clear, joint objectives and\nco-operation as a means of achieving interdependence and a reduction of costly governance measures were\nrecognised by both sides (Beamish & Banks, 1987, Faulkner & De Rond, 2000, Moss Kanter, 1994,\nSpekman et al, 1998).\nIn-house\nproduction\nPurchasing\nfrom\nsubsidiaries\nNetworksJoint\nventures\nPartnership\nsourcing\nPreferred\nsupplier\nSpot\nmarket\nMonopoly Buyer or\nMonopsony Seller\nDestructive Competition\nMonopoly Buyer &\nMonopsony Seller\nEconomic Power\nDirect\/\nHierarchical\nWelfare gains\nskewed\nWelfare gains more\nequally reduced\nFigure 8.

Problems of disclosure and implied power balance over proprietary\ninformation were detected (Sheth & Sharma, 1997). Additionally, reticence over joint performance\nmeasurement and a lack of contract fulfilment arrangements were marked by a calculative approach to\ntrust (Hill, 1980, Matthyssens, 1994). Nevertheless, free, frequent information sharing and the investment\nin specific resources such as shared data environments were evident (Faulkner & De Rond, 2000, Harrison,\n1990, Mohr & Spekman, 1994, Morgan & Hunt, 1994).\n\uf0b7 Opportunism (49%). Information impactedness resulting from selective and deliberate withholding of\nhighly specific, proprietary and supply chain data as well as opportunism resulting in poor service delivery\n(Christopher, 1997, Harrison, 1990) and unsatisfactory commercial practices were found under this\ndimension (Hill, 1990, Noordewier et al, 1990). Buyers especially accused sellers of abusing their\nmonopoly position and behaving opportunistically by failing to display goodwill, trust and commitment\n(Beamish & Banks, 1987, Faulkner & De Rond, 2000, Palmer, 2001, Williamson, 1979) to provide an\nadequate service. Conversely, interdependence achieved through the credible commitment of specific,\nrelationship-building assets such as stable work force and product\/process development and, joint problem-\nsolving arrangements appeared to strengthen relationships by creating a more reliable business\ninfrastructure (Argyres & Porter Liebskind, 1999, Doz & Baburoglu, 2000, Goleman, 1998, Hatch, 1997,\nHulme, 1997).\n\uf0b7 Small Numbers (66%). The failure of contractual governance to maintain equity (Watson, 1999, Zajac &\nOlsen, 1993) and relationships free of fear of \u2018imprisonment\u2019 (Eisenhardt et al, 1997, Kramer, 1999)\nindicated that archetypal negative relationship features from Williamson\u2019s (1975) framework are eminently\npossible in real life. However, many instances of long-termism and interdependence marked by co-\noperation and investments in relationship-promoting resources were also in evidence (Cooper & Gardner,\n1993). Moreover, respondents realised the difficulties inherent in the business and the monopoly situation\nand were actively striving to turn round the unsatisfactory position because they felt that \u2018some win\u2019 was\nbetter than \u2018all lose\u2019 (Axelrod, 1984, Granovetter, 1985, Ouchi, 1980). This was contrary to the view that\nwithin the failed market there is little incentive to co-operate, control costs or improve output quality\n(Hirschman, 1970, Williamson, 1996).\nTheory Conclusions and Overall Contribution to Knowledge\nThe SCM, RM and TCE fields provide a useful basis for understanding business-to-business relationships.\nThey all describe a trend away from transactional to relational business dealings but explanations fall short\n17\nwhere sustained monopolies are concerned. Because of the difficulties of modelling such fundamental aspects\nof economic exchange there is scant empirical research that integrates TCE concepts (Ghoshal & Moran, 1996,\nPalmer, 2001) and especially in the UK DP business sector (Parker & Hartley, 1997). Moreover, this research\nrarely covers both buyer and supplier perspectives (Ghoshal & Moran, 1996). This exploratory research, which\nappears to be the only empirical study on a significant sample of stable monopoly relationships, has thus\nextended these boundaries. The main finding is that contrary to expectations, a surprising diversity of positive,\nbusiness-driven behaviours was present within the monopolistic UK DP environment as well as more adverse\nmonopolistic dynamics. As predicted by the model, lack of investment in specific assets such as work force\nstability and product\/process development, the use of inadequate performance measures, opportunistically\nproviding poor goods and services and, using proprietary information as a weapon, reduced the chances of\nachieving interdependence and equitable outcomes. On the other hand despite the adverse monopolistic\ninfluences, strong counterbalancing, positive business drivers were able to produce examples of relationship-\nbuilding, specific investments, co-operative behaviour, open communications and a desire to reduce the burden\nof governance through more equitable, long-term arrangements.\nThe research findings suggest a different view of the adopted theoretical framework in Figure 3. Figure 9\nsummarises this position. At either end of the transactional\/relational spectrum there are positive and negative\nattracting influences, which drive behavioral results that influence the relationships.\nFigure 9.

In effect it reveals a very interesting and complex set of business\nrelational dynamics and opens up the possibility of many interesting opportunities for further research. Finally,\nthe interdisciplinarity approach to this research using 3 disciplines has produced transcendent insights that\nwould not be perceived by the individual disciplines working alone (Starkey & Madan, 2001).\nImplications for Managers\nWithin UK DP the pattern of results indicates that manager need to accept that the monopoly environment will\ninevitably reduce relationship quality and examining relationships from both sides, using this information in an\nopen, constructive manner will facilitate understanding and therefore improvement. However, reducing the\nimpact of environmental influences that, due to the limited availability of options for action, cause frustration\nwill also limit negative behaviours. The research results indicate that paying particular attention to\nsynchronising objectives and confidence-building as well as service and product delivery, lowering joint costs\nand risks and measures to support the growth of trust. Finally, the research approach clearly suggests the benefit\nto taking a strategic approach to measuring the quality of business-to-business relationships so that the best and\nworst can be identified and why and targeted action can be taken and progress may be tracked (Humphries &\nWilding, 2001b).\nLimitations\nThis research has used a narrow view through a specific theoretical model lens to achieve a specified\nunderstanding of monopolistic UK DP business relationships and necessarily; the approach has been high level\ndue to the exploratory nature of the research. It is thus essential to view the value of the research only through\nthis very narrow gap and to accept that other models and research designs will be need to be used in order to\ntriangulate its findings and assess its wider generalisability.\nImplications for Further Research\nThis research has been limited in its scope and depth due to time and resources. It has nevertheless, for the first\ntime achieved a cross-relationship (MoD\/Industry) perspective of a significant sample of sustained monopoly\nbusinesses. This \u2018cracking open the door\u2019 suggests that further research would be interesting to academics and\nuseful to the increasingly globalised DP business as well as other business areas with monopolistic\ncharacteristics. The subject area could potentially offer rich opportunities for longitudinal studies, proactive\napproaches such as action and experimental research as well as the use of alternative theoretical fields. We also\n19\nrecommend that that none should be viewed in isolation since many overlap and converge and, provide the\nchance to carry out integrated research programmes.\nA Final Word\nThe literature suggests that the little known about the relationship dynamics within monopolies presupposes\nnegative outcomes. This research has shown that although behavioural characteristics can be recognised in the\nliterature, a spectrum of positive and negative results were exposed and the main dynamics could be understood.\nThe contribution to knowledge plus the inherent limitations of the study have suggested an agenda for future\nresearch which it is hoped will advance the SCM, RM and TCE fields and provide greater perspectives into the\nworkings of monopolistic business-to-business relationships.\n20\nAppendix 1 \u2013 Questionnaire Dimensions and Questions\n1.
