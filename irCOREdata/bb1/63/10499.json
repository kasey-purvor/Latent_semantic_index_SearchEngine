Identifying and quantifying the importance of sites that predict viral strain cross-reactivity not just for single viruses but across entire serotypes can help in the design of vaccines with better targeting and broader coverage. These techniques can be generalized to any infectious agents where cross-reactivity assays have been carried out. As the parameterization uses pre-existing datasets, this approach quickly and cheaply increases both our understanding of antigenic relationships and our power to control disease.<\/dc:description><dc:format>application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>http:\/\/eprints.gla.ac.uk\/46099\/1\/46099.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:publisher>Public Library of Science<\/dc:publisher><dc:source>1553-734X<\/dc:source><dc:title>Sequence-based prediction for vaccine strain selection and identification of antigenic variability in foot-and-mouth disease virus<\/dc:title><rioxxterms:author>Reeve, R.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Blignaut, B.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Esterhuysen, J.J.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Opperman, P.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author id=\"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4420-8367\" >Matthews, L.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Fry, E.E.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>de Beer, T.A.P.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Theron, J.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Rieder, E.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Vosloo, W.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>O'Neill, H.G.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Haydon, D.T.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Maree, F.F.<\/rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:project funder_name=\"Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)\" >Predicting immunological cross-reactivity - from genotype to antigenic phenotype<\/rioxxterms:project><rioxxterms:publication_date>2010<\/rioxxterms:publication_date><rioxxterms:type>Journal Article\/Review<\/rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>VoR<\/rioxxterms:version><rioxxterms:version_of_record>http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1001027<\/rioxxterms:version_of_record><\/rioxx><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"relations":[],"year":2010,"topics":[],"subject":[],"fullText":""}
