Will it merely make peo-\nple \u201csmarter\u201d by providing seamless, context-aware\naccess to information, or will it\nalso enrich their social interac-\ntions?\nTo advance the wearable com-\nputing paradigm for personal\ncomputing, we must carefully\nconsider this technology\u2019s social\nmechanisms, potential, and con-\nstraints. Some important research\nquestions we must consider include\n\u2022 What social potentials do wearable computers\nhave?\n\u2022 What system requirements and characteristics will\nrealize these potentials? \n\u2022 How can we systematically and effectively build\nsuch systems?\n\u2022 What are this technology\u2019s social impacts?\nThe preliminary state of wearable computing\ntechnology and the low number of systems in active\nuse keeps us from satisfactorily answering all these\nquestions. To advance the wearable computing par-\nadigm, however, we must start investigating these\nissues and develop a socially acceptable vision of\nwearable computing. This article presents a frame-\nwork for wearable technology support for social\nnetworks. Our WearCom wearable community\ndesign methodology facilitates application creation\nand provides a framework for investigating the\nsocial and technical issues involved.\nWearable communities\nWe use the research framework of computer-\nmediated communities4\u20136 to investigate wearable\ncomputers\u2019 social potential. Wearable communities\ndenote the social networks that might emerge when\nenough people use wearable computing technology\nthroughout their daily lives.7Using a particular tech-\nnology, namely wearable computers, defines such a\ncommunity just as Internet use defines an online\ncommunity. Like online communities, wearable\ncommunities are multiparty conversations organized\naround affinities and shared interests, bringing\ntogether people who don\u2019t necessarily know each\nother personally. Unlike online communities, how-\never, they are based on embodied, real-world human\nencounters augmented by wearable computers.\nThe combination of wearable computing devices\nand wireless personal area networks presents inter-\nesting opportunities.8 WPANs such as Bluetooth\nenable seamless ad hoc communication over short-\nrange radio links (up to 10 meters) and let people\u2019s\nwearable computers communicate during face-to-\nface encounters.

Current systems and applications\nemphasize intellectual and sensory capa-\nbilities over interpersonal interactions and\nsocial competence. The danger of this trend\nis that wearable systems may end up\ninhibiting interaction. We\u2019ll eventually\novercome some of the potentially negative\nsocial implications that stem from their\ncurrent state (such as bulky head-mounted\ndisplays), but others are inherent to the\nwearable computing paradigm. By attend-\ning to the device and the information it pre-\nsents them, wearable users have less time\nand attention to offer people nearby. Such\nbehavior can negatively influence out-\nsiders\u2019 view of wearable computers and\ntheir use.\nAugmenting social space\nThe idea of wearable communities is\nbased on the notion of augmented social\nspace, where WPANs generate a sphere-like\ndigital field that envelops a wearable com-\nputer and its user (see Figure 1). Social space\ndefines the space in which humans interact.\nEdward Hall suggests four distinct inter-\npersonal communication proximity lev-\nels\u2014intimate, personal, social, and public\nspace9\u2014each defining a region around the\nbody with invisible boundaries determined\nby the body\u2019s spatial characteristics, cul-\ntural conditions, and social relationships.\nTouch happens in intimate space, conver-\nsation in personal space. Groups of people\nset up social distances, usually 10 feet or\nless; public space extends beyond this.\nInformation broadcast by the wearable\ncomputer fills a digital social space whose\nsize depends on the wireless transceivers\u2019\ntransmission range and can range from a\nfew inches to several feet. The human eye\ncan\u2019t see the digital field, but the wearable\ncomputers can. When two computers\u2019 dig-\nital social spaces overlap, they become\naware of each other. We see the digital field\nas the alter ego of human social space: just\nas the concept of social space describes fac-\ntors that influence interpersonal activities,\nthe concept of digital social space describes\nfactors that influence interactions between\nwearable devices. Interactions in the social\nrealm can initiate interactions in the digi-\ntal realm, and vice versa.\nBased on the notion of augmented social\nspace, we define a wearable community as\na social network that people create or\nmaintain using wearable computing\ndevices. A collection of users becomes a\ncommunity when enough people use their\nwearable computers to form webs of per-\nsonal relationships. This notion of wear-\nable communities acknowledges and is\nbased on the unique value of random\nencounters and face-to-face interactions.\nWe believe community building depends\non fully embodied \u201chuman moments.\u201d\nWhile the Internet and online communi-\nties have separated physical place and\nsocial space, our work on wearable com-\nmunities tries to reunite them\u2014rather than\nreplacing face-to-face interactions, we\nintend to augment them.\nFor example, when two people con-\nversing exchange electronic business cards\nbetween their PCs, social interaction leads\nto digital interaction. On the other hand,\ninteractions between wearable devices can\nfacilitate or even augment social interac-\ntions. For example, wearable computers\ncan inform their users about another per-\nson\u2019s presence nearby, autonomously\nexchange information, quietly gather infor-\nmation about encounters, or suggest a con-\nversation topic of mutual interest. They\nmay even speculate and inform the user\nabout affinity relationships from repeated\nencounters.10\nApplications\nTo illustrate the interactions that might\ntake place within a wearable community, we\ndescribe several implemented applications.\nGenie. We designed this simple application\nto improve knowledge exchange within a\ndispersed group of wearable computer\nusers, for example, students attending the\nsame college. Genie makes the group\u2019s\ncombined expertise available to every\ngroup member. Some might be soccer\nexperts; others might be hobby gardeners\nwith extensive horticultural knowledge,\nbut someone who needs to answer a par-\nticular question often doesn\u2019t know who\ncan help them. Genie members use their\nWPAN-equipped wearable computers to\n12 PERVASIVEcomputing http:\/\/computer.org\/pervasive\nWEARABLE COMPUTING\nHuman interaction\nDigital interaction Wearable computer Wearable computer\nFigure 1. Augmenting social space with wearable computers.automatically find fellow community\nmembers who can provide just-in-time\nexpertise.\nUsing Genie, each user defines a set of\nquestions that are stored on the wearable\ndevice. Whenever two or more wearable\nusers meet, their wearable computers\nexchange questions. This might happen\nduring informal chance encounters occur-\nring throughout a day, for example, dur-\ning lunch or at a coffee shop. After receiv-\ning a question, the device displays the\nquestion and asks the user whether he or\nshe knows the answer and is willing to pro-\nvide it to the other user. Genie relays the\nresponse from one computer to the other in\nreal time. The system transmits only an\nindication of a person\u2019s willingness to\nengage in a conversation, not the answer\nitself. After a successful exchange, the users\ncan approach each other and discuss the\ntopic of interest face to face. To help users\nidentify each other, the computers also\nexchange personal information such as\nuser names or photos.\nAlthough simple in many respects, this\nexample illustrates many important aspects\nof wearable communities. First, the notion\nof wearable communities acknowledges\nand builds on the unique value of random\nencounters and face-to-face interactions.\nInteractions in wearable communities are\nsituated and involve a rich social context:\nusers are aware of whom they are inter-\nacting with and thus can observe impor-\ntant social cues such as sex, appearance,\nand gestures. The addition of social con-\ntext shapes people\u2019s willingness to engage\nwith strangers and the particular manner in\nwhich they interact.\nSecond, wearable communities may or\nmay not be built on top of existing social\nnetworks. In particular, wearable commu-\nnities can facilitate face-to-face interactions\nbetween strangers. The only prerequisite\nfor a wearable community is a group of\nwearable users willing to cooperate through\nautomated interactions of their respective\nwearable computers, regardless of preex-\nisting social ties.\nThird, you cannot implement wearable\ncommunity applications with traditional\nmobile devices such as laptops and PDAs.\nThey require devices that are\n\u2022 Constant: always on and running\n\u2022 Presence-aware: aware of the presence\nof nearby devices and people\n\u2022 Communicative: able to communicate\nwith other collocated devices \n\u2022 Proactive: able to perform tasks auton-\nomously and proactively without requir-\ning explicit user intervention (although\ninteractivity might also be supported)\nThis definition is consistent with previous\ndefinitions of wearable computers1\u20133,11but\nadds important functional requirements.\nSpecifically, it emphasizes the ability to\ncommunicate with nearby devices and\nreplaces a generic context awareness with\na more specific presence awareness.\nOther examples. Genie is a simple appli-\ncation that encourages direct face-to-face\ninteraction. We have also built several\napplications in which digital interactions\noccur implicitly\u2014that is, without users\u2019\nknowledge but with their consent.\nThe Pirat\u00e9 collaborative music guide12\nborrows ideas from peer-to-peer file shar-\ning applications such as Napster and\nmoves them to the wearable domain. Pirat\u00e9\nlets users exchange MP3 playlists and\nmusic recommendations during brief ran-\ndom encounters. Serendipitously exchang-\ning and accumulating information\nthroughout the day helps users discover\nnew music based on the playing habits of\nthose they meet most often, provides\nawareness of the community\u2019s favorite\nmusic titles, and lets users discover with\nwhom they share a common taste in music.\nIn contrast to Genie, members of the Pirat\u00e9\ncommunity do not engage in direct face-\nto-face interactions: exchanges occur\nimplicitly whenever two or more people\ncome physically close. Users aren\u2019t aware\nof interactions between their wearable\ncomputers.\nThe WALID (Wearable Augmented\nTask-List Interchange Device) community\napplication digitizes the timeworn tradi-\ntion of borrowing butter from your neigh-\nbor.7 You help others because you know\nthat one day they will return the favor.\nWith WALID, two people use their wear-\nable devices during random encounters to\nnegotiate and exchange real-world tasks,\nsuch as dropping off someone\u2019s dry clean-\ning, buying stamps at the post office, or\nreturning a library book. WALID uses per-\nsonal-agent software to find nearby com-\nmunity members and negotiate the\nexchange of favors. The agents maintain a\nuser\u2019s task list, becoming fully aware of the\nlocations and activities involved. When an\nencounter occurs, the agents produce a\nnegotiation. If both users approve, a deal\nis struck. In a negotiation, the agent eval-\nuates the value of favors and keeps scores:\nhaving to run across town just to drop off\nsomeone\u2019s mail compares unfavorably\nwith buying milk for someone if the gro-\ncery store is just a block away. Agents\nemploy ideas from game theory to ensure\nthat negotiation results are mutually ben-\neficial: they cooperate only if doing so\nenhances the users\u2019 goals.\nWe envision many other wearable\ncommunities:\n\u2022 Computing communities: members\nshare computational resources such as\nnetwork bandwidth and computing\ncycles\n\u2022 Helper communities: members pledge to\nJANUARY\u2013MARCH 2003 PERVASIVEcomputing 13\nThe notion of wearable communities\nacknowledges and builds on the unique \nvalue of random encounters and \nface-to-face interactions.assist each other when in distress\n\u2022 Bargain-hunter communities: members\ncollectively search out sale items in\nlocal stores\n\u2022 Marketplace communities: people\nexchange goods without money\n\u2022 Job market communities: free applica-\ntions offer services to passersby\n\u2022 Knowledge communities: members col-\nlectively accumulate information to cre-\nate shared understanding\n\u2022 Political communities: members create\nnew forms of instant democracy and\nlocal activism\nFrom online to wearable\ncommunities\nWearable communities have precursors\nin other types of computer-mediated com-\nmunities. One of the most powerful fea-\ntures of today\u2019s Internet is its ability to\nenable total strangers to interact on a per-\nsonal and sometimes even intimate level.\nPeople who have never met (and are\nunlikely to ever do so) use the Internet to\ndiscuss personal matters related to health,\nraising kids, romance, and many other top-\nics of shared interest. In effect, the Internet\nprovides the connectivity for the \u201cglobal\ninformation community\u201d that J.C.R. Lick-\nlider envisioned in 1968 as being \u201cnot of\ncommon location, but of common inter-\nest.\u201d13Howard Rheingold, who coined the\nterm \u201cvirtual community,\u201d14described the\nInternet as a place that enables a new type\nof social network, mediated by computer\nterminals and networks. He defined virtual\ncommunities as \u201csocial aggregations that\nemerge from the Internet when enough\npeople carry on public discussions long\nenough and with sufficient human feeling\nto form webs of personal relationships.\u201d\nTechnologies such as mobile phones and\nInternet-enabled PDAs have begun to\nextend online communities\u2019 reach to\nmobile users. For example, online com-\nmunity sites such as eBay give users access\nto community tools from their mobile\ndevices, allowing members to stay in touch\nwith their community at anytime from any\nplace. Also, mobile communities are pro-\nliferating in which interactions between\nmembers happen exclusively with mobile\ndevices (mostly through SMS messages and\nmobile phones). Examples of mobile com-\nmunities include Upoc, mopilot, and cos-\nmiccupid.\nDespite their widespread and successful\nadoption, however, mobile phones and\nInternet-enabled PDAs have serious flaws\nas enablers of new communities. They\ndon\u2019t support many-to-many communica-\ntion very well and don\u2019t facilitate random\nencounters (either virtual or real). Conse-\nquently, it is difficult to create new rela-\ntionships using mobile phones. Moreover,\nthe use of traditional mobile devices can\npotentially decrease real-world random\nencounters and face-to-face interactions:\nby attending to people located elsewhere,\nmobile users possibly reduce the amount\nof time and attention they pay to strangers\nnearby. These factors make current mobile\ntechnologies well suited for maintaining\nexisting community relationships but less\napt at creating new ones.\nHow wearable communities differ\nLike online and mobile communities,\nwearable communities consist of webs of\nrelationships that grow from computer-\naugmented social interactions. (See the\nsidebar \u201cSupporting Face-to-Face Com-\nmunications\u201d for current wearable com-\nmunity examples.) They differ from tradi-\ntional online communities, however, in\nthree important ways.\nSocial context. Wearable communities are\nbased on direct encounters rather than\nindirect, remote interactions. Thus, inter-\nactions are situated and involve a rich\nsocial context. WPAN exchanges must\noccur over short distances\u2014when people\ncome face to face or are at least within close\nphysical proximity. Communication part-\nners thus can usually see whom they\u2019re\ninteracting with and observe such impor-\ntant social cues as gender, clothing, and ges-\ntures. They might even be able to talk to\neach other. The addition of social context\nshapes people\u2019s willingness to engage with\nstrangers and how they interact.\nUsage context. People use wearable devices\nin different contexts than they use station-\nary computers at home or work. User\nattention becomes scarce because, instead\nof sitting in front of a computer where they\ncan pay full attention to the computer and\nits operation, wearable computer users also\nengage in real-world tasks such as driving,\noperating a machine, or simply conversing\nwith other people. Time also becomes a\ncritical resource\u2014when surfing the Inter-\nnet at home or at work, people have more\npatience with delays because they can shift\ntheir attention to another task. This no\nlonger holds true when exchanges occur\nspontaneously between people who hap-\npen to meet during their daily activities.\nTechnical context. WPANs offer limited\nbandwidth and reliability compared to\nwired networks. Pirat\u00e9 showed us that we\nshould therefore design systems to\nexchange low-fidelity data or meta-infor-\nmation such as song recommendations\nrather than large MP3 files.\nWhen does a collection of individuals\nbecome a wearable community?\nA community isn\u2019t a perfectly organized\ngroup where everyone who participates\ngains equally. Among other things, people\u2019s\nindividual actions primarily serve their\nown interests. How people deal with con-\nflicting interests determines a successful\nversus an unsuccessful community. We\u2019ve\nidentified several factors that influence peo-\nple\u2019s behavior in wearable communities:\n14 PERVASIVEcomputing http:\/\/computer.org\/pervasive\nWEARABLE COMPUTING\nHow people deal with conflicting interests\ndetermines a successful versus \nan unsuccessful community.\u2022 Identity.Our sense of whom we\u2019re inter-\nacting with shapes all interactions, even\nthose with strangers. Our clothes, voices,\nbodies, and gestures send messages\nabout status, power, and group mem-\nbership. Wearable technology lets people\ndefine and broadcast digital identities\nthat may or may not be their true iden-\ntities. In contrast to online communities,\nthese digital identities augment rather\nthan replace a person\u2019s true identity, as\nboth are visible at the same time.\nBecause observers can match the digital\nidentity to a person\u2019s appearance and\nbehavior, people in wearable communi-\nties can\u2019t easily switch identities.\n\u2022 Privacy. Unlike security, which deals\nwith keeping information away from\nunauthorized users, privacy gives peo-\nple the right to control collection and use\nof their personal information, including\nwhen, how, and to what extent infor-\nmation about them is communicated to\nothers. Most wearable communities\nrequire members to disclose certain per-\nsonal information.\n\u2022 Trust. This aspect of human interaction\ndiffers when people interact in person\nversus across the Internet. Being able to\nlook at someone, observe gestures, and\nmimic them tells you a lot about another\nperson. People place much importance\nin a handshake when completing a trans-\naction because it signals commitment\nand mutual trust. No equivalent of a\nhandshake exists in online communities.\nWearable community systems\nUnlike online communities, which have\na mature and proven technological foun-\ndation, wearable communities require\ncomplex, less mature technologies such as\nwearable devices, wireless ad hoc net-\nworks, spontaneous networking mecha-\nnisms, and context technologies. To bring\nwearable communities together, we must\nbuild reliable wearable community sys-\ntems\u2014collections of wearable devices, dis-\ntributed software infrastructure, and appli-\ncation software that let people interact\nwith fellow community members (see Fig-\nure 2). Systemrefers to software and hard-\nware that set the context for interaction,\nand wearable indicates the devices\u2019 wear-\nable nature and implies that they\u2019re always\nJANUARY\u2013MARCH 2003 PERVASIVEcomputing 15\nT\nhe notion of wearable communities defines a research\nframework for investigating computer support for face-to-\nface social interactions. Such interactions are often spontaneous\n(driven by chance encounters of mobile people) and situated\n(embedded in the real-world context in which people interact).\nSeveral recently developed systems support such interactions.\nThese include match-making technologies (LoveGety1), awareness\ndevices to give roaming groups a sense of connectedness (Hum-\nmingBird2), ad hoc games that incorporate real-world group mo-\nbility into digital entertainment (Pirates,3 Pervasive Clue4), systems\nfor education and exploratory learning (Geney5), collaborative\naugmented-reality systems,6 and messaging devices that adopt\n\u201cword-of-mouth\u201d metaphors for proximity-based information\npassing (ThinkingTags,7 MemeTags,8 iBalls9).\nThese systems represent important precursors of wearable com-\nmunity systems, yet key questions remain unexplored. First, ex-\ncept for Richard Borovoy,8 few have investigated this technology\u2019s\nsocial implications over time. Most systems are one-off prototypes\nthat have seen little or no real deployment, so we don\u2019t really\nknow how augmenting face-to-face interactions affects personal\nrelationships and communal behavior. Second, we have no sys-\ntematic engineering process for such systems. Developers have no\ninfrastructures or tools to leverage but must build each system\nfrom the ground up, in a manner dictated by the underlying net-\nwork technology and device platform. Many systems thus have a\nlimited feature set and cannot evolve to accommodate design\nchanges.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Thus, a wearable com-\nmunity system is a highly dynamic, loosely\nconnected, potentially large-scale distrib-\nuted system made up of wearable hosts. To\nsupport the formation of wearable com-\nmunities anywhere, anytime, such a sys-\ntem must be independent of external com-\nmunication and computing infrastructures,\nrelying solely on device capabilities. Sys-\ntem- and application-level software per-\nforms essential functions, such as discov-\nering nearby devices and users, initiating\ninteractions across wireless links, manag-\ning user identities, and handling user input\nand output. Because of the environment\u2019s\ncomplexity, developing effective systems\npresents a fundamental challenge to build-\ning wearable communities.\nAn exploratory design\napproach\nIn wearable communities, social con-\ncerns become difficult to separate from\ntechnical practices. To design a wearable\ncommunity, we must simultaneously con-\nsider technology and social interactions\nbecause wearable communities, like all\ncommunities, result from people\u2019s self-\norganizing behavior. Relationships emerge\nfrom interactions over time; we cannot\nconstruct them following a simple recipe.\nSuccessful community design often\nhinges on what Wenger15 called minimal-\nist design, which starts with a provisional\ndesign and facilitates community growth\nover time. Designers must identify the\nattributes that make communities success-\nful and design technology that embodies\nthese attributes. When building wearable\ncommunities, we face the following fun-\ndamental problem:\nWearable communities require\nhardware and software to support\nthem, but without real-world experi-\nences we do not know what success\nfactors to look for and how to design\nsystems to embody them.\nSolving the engineering problem and mak-\ning it easier to develop wearable commu-\nnity systems will help us create and inves-\ntigate wearable communities.\nTo solve this problem, we developed the\nWearCom design methodology.16WearCom\nsupports an exploratory design approach\nbased on rapid prototyping of wearable\ncommunity systems. Rapid prototyping\nhas proved useful for creating several gen-\nerations of the Vu-Man wearable com-\nputer.17 Our work extends this by taking\na systematic approach to designing an\nentire sociotechnical wearable computing\nsystem.\nThe WearCom methodology integrates\nsocial and technical concerns and guides\ndesigners from scenario development to\nimplementation. WearCom provides\n\u2022 A design language that allows the spec-\nification of important design decisions\n\u2022 A design process that outlines an itera-\ntive sequence of individual design activ-\nities, each of which generates a specific\ndesign artifact (specifications and soft-\nware components)\n\u2022 The Proem software platform,18 which\nsupports the implementation and exe-\ncution of proactive, presence-aware\nwearable community applications\nWearCom specifies three design ele-\nments. A user profile\u2014a typed data item\nthat defines a user\u2019s identity within a com-\nmunity\u2014contains information the user dis-\ncloses willingly to other community mem-\nbers along with that deemed useful or\nnecessary for community purposes. A com-\nmunity protocol defines how wearable\ncomputers interact when people meet. Pro-\ntocols deal with communication content,\nnot mechanisms, and in essence formalize\nrituals of engagement. A community agent\n\u2014an executable software component that\nimplements the community protocol\u2014\nruns on the wearable device and functions\nas intermediary between user and com-\nmunity (see Figure 3).\nCase studies\nWe performed several case studies to test\nour hypothesis that an exploratory design\napproach facilitates wearable community\nbuilding. Between Spring 2001 and Spring\n2002 we taught three software engineering\ncourses at the University of Oregon in which\nstudents used the WearCom methodology\n16 PERVASIVEcomputing http:\/\/computer.org\/pervasive\nWEARABLE COMPUTING\nW\nW W\nW\nW\nW\nW\nW\nW\nW\nW\nFigure 2. A wearable community system.to design and implement wearable com-\nmunity applications. In total, 35 students\ndivided into 10 project teams worked on\nfour projects:\n\u2022 mClique, a community system designed\nto improve awareness among mobile\nusers by determining groups (cliques) of\nmutually connected friends\n\u2022 mBazaar, a wearable community system\nthat brings together buyers and sellers\nof goods\n\u2022 Pirat\u00e9, a collaborative music guide that\ncreates community awareness (discussed\nearlier)\n\u2022 Infomediation, a peer-to-peer informa-\ntion publishing and access system that\nlets collocated users collaboratively com-\npare prices at online bookstores\nWearCom proved successful in guiding\nthe student teams\u2019 design activities. During\nthe projects, we tracked data relating to\nlearning time, development time, complex-\nity of developed applications, and support\nrequirements. Within 10 weeks, students\nlearned to design wearable communities,\nimplement applications, and experiment\nwith the initial prototypes. It typically took\nstudents less than a week to learn the\nmethodology and to write their first appli-\ncation using Proem. After a design phase\nof about three weeks, students took five\nweeks using an iterative process to develop\napplication prototypes. Teams deployed\nthe applications on a testbed consisting of\nlaptop, handheld, and wearable devices.\nThe Proem platform not only simplified\nimplementation but also made it possible\nto run applications on diverse hardware\nplatforms. \nFor each project, we tracked support\ninstances (how many times teachers aided\nstudents) and, on average, counted fewer\nthan 3 instances per 10-week course. Con-\ntributing to this surprisingly low number\nwas that we had encouraged students to\nshare their expertise across teams. In sum,\nwe found that the WearCom methodology\neffectively supported rapid prototyping of\nwearable community systems.\nDespite this success, the overarching goal\nof building successful wearable communi-\nties remains elusive. A true community\nemerges over time and with regular tech-\nnology use, and practical considerations\nlimited our experiences with the applica-\ntions developed. A major obstacle is the\nlack of adequate hardware\u2014wearable\ncomputers that are constant, proactive,\ncommunicative, and presence-aware aren\u2019t\nyet available in large enough quantities to\nreach the critical mass necessary for com-\nmunity building. This has limited us to\nhighly experimental systems confined to\nsmall groups of people at our lab, and have\nprevented us from systematically analyzing\nthe wearable communities\u2019 social dynam-\nics. The projects have, however, given us\ninsight into what does and doesn\u2019t work\nwhen building wearable communities.\nDesign principles for wearable\ncommunities\nSociologists have extensively researched\nthe successes and failures of online19,20and\nface-to-face communities.21 Although we\nhaven\u2019t empirically studied wearable com-\nmunity dynamics, we have identified six\npreliminary design principles that con-\ntribute to successful wearable communi-\nties. Developers can apply these guidelines\nto evaluate existing designs, guide the\ndesign process, and educate designers\nabout the characteristics of successful\nwearable community systems.\nPrinciple 1: Make users aware of the hid-\nden benefits of random encounters. This\nprinciple guided design of the WALID\ncommunity application. When two people\nmeet, they usually aren\u2019t aware of each\nother\u2019s activities and, unless they talk about\ntheir respective errands, will never find out\nthat could benefit from a trade. WALID\u2019s\ncommunity agents look for possible trad-\ning partners and alert their respective users\nif a mutually beneficial trade opportunity\narises. Once users become aware of this,\nthey can act on or ignore the agents\u2019 advice.\nPrinciple 2: Reward users for social\ninteractions. The frequency of social\nencounters per person should be propor-\ntional to the gain a user receives from using\nthe system.\nPrinciple 3: Help people to recognize\neach other. Without identity and mutual\nrecognition, a group of people will always\nremain strangers. Promoting altruistic\nbehavior and cooperation necessitates a\nsocial feedback mechanism that lets users\nevaluate and track others\u2019 behavior. Such\nJANUARY\u2013MARCH 2003 PERVASIVEcomputing 17\nAgent\u2013agent interaction\nWearable computer\nwith community\nagent\nHuman\u2013agent\ninteraction\nHuman\u2013agent\ninteraction\nWearable computer\nwith community\nagent\nFigure 3. Community agents and \ncommunity protocol in WearCom.a feedback mechanism requires identity\nand mutual recognition.\nPrinciple 4:  Support expressiveness.\nLive-action role-playing games have gained\nwidespread international popularity. Such\ngames become social events bringing\ntogether people who have taken on imag-\ninary identities based on historical or myth-\nical characters, and the social interactions\ncontribute much to players\u2019 enjoyment.\nSimilarly, wearable communities let mem-\nbers invent digital identities to augment\ntheir true identities. wearable communities\nshould promote such creativity and artis-\ntic expressiveness as much as possible.\nPrinciple 5: Use knowledge about past\nencounters to enrich present interactions.\nAn important aspect of social encounters is\nour ability to recognize other people and\nto remember if, when, where, and under\nwhat circumstances we met someone\nbefore. Wearable computers can track both\nthe user\u2019s current context (defined by other\npeople\u2019s presence) and his or her interac-\ntion history. Applying this knowledge in\nwearable communities can enrich interac-\ntions in significant ways.\nPrinciple 6:  Include social feedback\nloops. Any community has disruptive or\nunruly members\u2014in newsgroups, some\npeople consistently and inappropriately\nflame others; on eBay, some members cheat\nby not paying for items they purchase. Suc-\ncessful communities can police their mem-\nbers\u2019 behavior not by giving some mem-\nbers extraordinary powers but through\nsocial feedback. For example, eBay uses\nreputations (aggregated signed opinions\nfrom eBay users on a buyer\u2019s or seller\u2019s\ntransaction history) to let members rate\nand judge other members\u2019 trustworthiness.\nThe community thus virtually excludes dis-\nrupting members (Schneider22 presents a\ngood discussion of trust and reputation in\nwearable communities.)\nW\nilliam Gibson described\ncyberspace as a \u201cconsen-\nsual hallucination experi-\nenced daily by billions of\nlegitimate operators, in every nation.\u201d23\nWearable communities present an alterna-\ntive model of human communication that\nrelies not on shared imagination but on\nreal-world encounters and first-hand expe-\nriences. Mobile communication and com-\nputation technologies have sufficiently\npermeated our society to shape social\nbehavior, norms, and conventions. As\nmobile computers evolve into wearable\ncomputers\u2014constant, aware, commu-\nnicative, and proactive\u2014we can expect to\nsee even more dramatic changes. We\nbelieve that properly designed wearable\ncomputing technology can indeed beget\ncommunity by facilitating social networks\nbased on augmented interactions and face-\nto-face encounters.\nWearable communities face sociological\nas well as technical problems, which are dif-\nficult to separate\u2014they interact and coe-\nvolve intimately. We plan further empirical\nresearch on wearable communities and the\nsocial networks this technology creates. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was performed at and supported by the\nUniversity of Oregon\u2019s Computer and Information\nScience Department.\nFor more information on this or any other comput-\ning topic, please visit our Digital Library at http:\/\/\ncomputer.org\/publications\/dlib.\nREFERENCES\n1.
