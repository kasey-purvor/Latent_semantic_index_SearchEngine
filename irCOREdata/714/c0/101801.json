INTRODUCTION\nSURFACE plasmon resonance (SPR) [1]\u2013[4] is acknowl-edged to be a very powerful method for optical (bio)-chem-\nical sensing and, more generally, for understanding molecular\ninteractions and kinetics. This technique exploits changes in the\noptical constants of the analyte and\/or sensing layer. The sensing\ncan be performed without labeling or specific sample prepara-\ntion. Several commercial devices are currently on the market [5].\nHowever, it is believed that further improvements could come\nfrom the development of more compact systems with stable, in-\nexpensive and disposable sensors. In particular, the availability\nof SPR devices that include more than one measurement channel\nshould prove beneficial [6]\u2013[10].\nMultichannel SPR sensing provides a more accurate quantifi-\ncation of the molecular interactions by using so-called reference\nchannel(s). Consequently, it is possible to discriminate between\ntarget and nontarget molecular processes of adsorption on the\nsensor surface. Careful design of the SPR instrumentation al-\nlows different sensing layers to be addressed simultaneously.\nIn previous studies, we have shown that a CCD camera can be\nused to produce a set of data resembling that obtained from an\nManuscript received October 3, 2003; revised April 17, 2004. This work was\nsupported by the British Council and the German Academic Exchange Service\n(DAAD) in the framework of an Academic Research Collaboration (ARC) and\nby One NorthEast (University of Durham NanoMaterials Centre). The associate\neditor coordinating the review of this paper and approving it for publication was\nDr. Alvin Crumbliss.\nM. Palumbo and M. C.

This has no moving parts [12] and offers multi-\nchannel measurements using a single large-area chip. The in-\nstrumentation has been combined with layer-by-layer (LbL) as-\nsembled thin films to demonstrate metal cation recognition and\npH sensing [9], [10]. Although the new equipment possessed a\nlower angular resolution compared to \u201ctraditional\u201d SPR systems\n[9], [13], a significant advantage was that it could support sev-\neral measurement channels.\nThe LbL deposition technique is a simple and attractive\nmeans of assembling molecular architectures of nanometer\ndimensions [14]. This method is based on the principle of\nalternate deposition of oppositely charged polyions. Colloids,\nproteins, DNA, viruses, ceramics, and charged nanoparticles\n[15]\u2013[19] have also been successfully assembled. Polyelec-\ntrolyte multilayers are extremely versatile thin films that allow\nprecise control over their physical and chemical properties by\nchanges in the deposition conditions, for example, by varying\nthe ionic strength of the solution or its pH value [20]. These\nthin organic layers can, thus, be tailored for particular uses\n[21]\u2013[26]. Chemical sensing is one such promising field of\napplication [9], [10], [27]\u2013[30]. Metals, because of their impact\non the environment and health and their significance in all\nstages and forms of life [31], [32], represent an important focus\nof this work.\nIn this paper, a further advance in our development of a multi-\nchannel SPR sensor [9], [10] is described. Three polyelectolyte\nmaterials, poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), poly(ethylene-alt-maleic\nacid) (PMAE), and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), were used to\nbuild up two different thin film architectures. The films have\nbeen assembled on the same sensing chip and tested for their\nability to detect different metal ions in solution (Na, Fe, Ni, Cu,\nand Zn).\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\nA. Materials\nPEI (M ), poly(ethylene-alt-maleic anhydride)\n(average M ), PSS (sodium form,\nM ), sodium acetate Na(ac), copper(II) acetate\nCu ac , iron(II) acetate Fe ac , nickel(II) acetate tetrahy-\ndrate Ni ac , and zinc acetate Zn ac were obtained from\nSigma-Aldrich. PMAE was synthesized via the hydrolysis of\n1530-437X\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\n1160 IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL, VOL. 5, NO. 6, DECEMBER 2005\npoly(ethylene-alt-maleic anhydride). Solutions of concentra-\ntion M for PEI and M for PSS and PMAE were\nprepared in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, C H NO\n(tris), buffer solution. The pH of the buffer solution was set at\n6.2 by the addition of HCl.\nB. Substrate Preparation\n2 nm of chromium followed by 50 nm of gold were deposited\nusing e-beam evaporation on SF10 glass substrates (Hellma\nMA, Ltd). The polymer coating was prepared as reported in\nthe literature [18], [19] by an alternate sequence of immersion,\nfirst in PEI and then in PMAE, or PSS, for several minutes\neach. Different organic film deposition methods could be used:\nmanual or automatic dipping and also direct self-assembly in\nthe sensing cell.\nC. System Design\nThe SPR equipment [9] has no moving parts. Simultaneous\nillumination of the sample across a fixed area with a range of\nincident angles was provided by using a cylindrical lens to\nfocus a previously expanded monochromatic, -polarized light\nbeam. The light source was an InGaAlP red LED (Toshiba,\nTLRH190P), with a nominal peak emission wavelength of\n644 nm, a high luminous intensity (typically 15000 mcd @\n20 mA) and a limited view angle (typically 4 ). A mono-\nchrome CCD camera (COSTAR SI-M350 1\/2\u201d CCD camera\nwith C-mount, chip 752 582 pixels, 8.6-mm size) monitored\nthe reflected beam, while a 10 bit analogue board (MV-Sigma\nSLG, Matrix Vision) provided an interface to a PC. Finally,\nan in-house program was used to acquire and process the\ninformation from the CCD camera.\nD. AFM\nAn Explorer SPM (Topometrix) was used to obtain images of\nthe outer surface of the two different sensing films. The SPM\nwas set to operate in contact mode using a Contact AFM 1520\nV-shaped cantilever, with a silicon nitride tip.\nE. Chemical Sensing\nMetal-ion solutions were prepared in the concentration range\nof \u2013 M in tris buffer solution and their pH was fixed\nat 6.2 by the addition of HCl; the iron solutions were prepared\nat two different pH values, 6.2 and 7.6. In all the sensing exper-\niments, the sequence for the change of liquid in the sensing cell\nwas performed via a peristaltic pump running continuously at\n2 ml min. The procedures and timings were strictly controlled.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA schematic diagram showing the SPR cell and the working\nprinciple of the sensing system is shown in Fig. 1. A conver-\ngent beam is directed onto the gold coated sensing chip. The\nreflected beam will, therefore, possess a characteristic intensity\nminimum due to the excitation of surface plasmons at the inter-\nface metal\/dielectric. The variation in angular position of this\nminimum is recorded by a CCD camera connected to a com-\nputer for real-time analysis. Moreover, a specially designed chip\nFig. 1. Kretschmann SPR configuration with a convergent incident light beam.\nFig. 2. Large area single-chip incorporating several investigation channels.\nThe gold pattern on an SF10 glass plate was deposited via e-beam evaporation\nusing a shadow mask. The output from a commercial LED is first expanded and\nthen focused with a range of incident angles along the X direction indicated in\nfigure. It is then possible to acquire data from a cross section in theY direction.\nFig. 3. Optical image obtained from the SPR system with the sensing chip\nexposed to air. The reflectivity for the two regions of uncoated SF10 glass shows\na sharp variation near the critical angle. The change in reflectivity near the SPR\nangle is evident for the three regions of the sensing chip coated with 50 nm of\ngold.\nallows SPR interrogation of the sample along a line which might\ninclude several active sensing regions.\nOne of the gold patterns used to form the multichannel sensor\nis shown in Fig. 2. This \u201cchip\u201d was produced by e-beam evap-\noration through a shadow mask onto SF10 glass. The design\nprovided a clear physical distinction between the gold stripes\n(i.e., between the sensing channels) and allowed the acquisition\nof data from a cross sectional width of 15 mm ( direction in\nFig. 1). The number of channels can be varied using different\nmask patterns [9].\nFig. 3 shows an optical image captured using the SPR system\nwith the chip surface exposed to air. Note the presence of the re-\nflectivity minimum due to SPR in the areas coated with gold. For\nthe two uncoated stripes on the surfaces of the SF10 glass slide,\nPALUMBO et al.: SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE DETECTION OF METAL IONS 1161\nFig. 4. Chemical structures of the polyelectrolytes.\na strong reflectivity variation near the critical angle (angle of\ntotal reflection) is evident. These features are as expected from\ntheoretical predictions: A thin metal surface is needed to excite\nthe surface plasmons and the variation of reflectivity near the\ncritical angle will be more marked for an uncoated glass surface\nthan for one coated with metal. Given the actual optical config-\nuration and angular range, the CCD camera is able to capture\nthese images (i.e., as shown in Fig. 3) only if the sensing chip\nis in air. The critical angle and resonance minimum are much\nfurther apart when the chip is immersed in a liquid.\nThe chemical structures of the polyelectrolytes used in this\nwork are shown in Fig. 4. The principle of comparative sensing\nlies in the use of two different anionic polyelectrolytes, PMAE\nand PSS, as active sensing surfaces. PEI was used as a positively\ncharged substrate to promote adhesion of the two polyanion ma-\nterials. Because it remains as an undissociated polybase in the\nalkaline range, PEI belongs to the category of weak polyelec-\ntrolytes [33]. In contrast, PSS is a strong polyelectrolyte as it\nforms a dissociated macroion\/counterion system throughout the\npH range 0 to 14 [33]. PMAE is a polymaleic acid copolymer\nand is usually obtained by hydrolysis of ethylene\u2013maleic anhy-\ndride copolymers. The material has two carboxylic acid groups\nalong the chain that form part of a pendant group and may be\nconsidered as weak polyacid [33], [34]. For each of the thin film\narchitectures investigated for chemical sensing, a single bilayer\nwas deposited on separate gold surfaces on the same chip. The\nprocess of self assembly was performed directly in the cell used\nfor the chemical detection.\nAFM images of the active surfaces of PEI\/PMAE and\nPEI\/PSS (three bilayers in each case) are shown in Fig. 5.\nThe scans were undertaken with the organic films in air. A\nmuch smoother surface is evident for the PEI\/PSS architecture\n[Fig. 5(b)]. The RMS roughness of the area analyzed for the\nthree bilayer PEI\/PSS film was approximately 1.9 nm compared\nto a value of about 15.2 nm for the film composed of three\nPEI\/PMAE bilayers. This probably arises from the difference\nin electric charge density between PMAE and PSS. The charge\ndensity on the PMAE chain will be low at pH 6.2, as it is a weak\npolyacid [14]. As result of this and consequent intermolecular\ninteractions, this material deposits on the underlying PEI sub-\nstrate in a coiled form rather than as a straight chain. However,\nin the case of PSS, a more elongated polymer chain is expected\nbecause of its strong electrostatic nature. Repulsive Coulombic\nFig. 5. AFM images of (a) three bilayers of (PEI\/PMAE) and (b) three bilayers\nof (PEI\/PSS). The scans were performed in air and using the contact mode.\nforces between the charges along the polymer ensure a rod like\nconformation of the chains. The variation in surface roughness\nfor the different samples might be expected to affect the SPR\ncurves. However, our preliminary study has not revealed any\nmajor influence. This may well be related to our particular\ndesign of SPR system in which the lateral distribution of the\nlight on the sample and the finite bandwidth of the light source\nwill produce a reflectivity that is the result of the superposition\nof a number of SPR curves, i.e., the optical response of the film\nwill be averaged over a relatively large area.\nThe SPR curves corresponding to one bilayer of (PEI\/PMAE)\ndeposited on gold are shown in Fig. 6. As expected, the addi-\ntion of the organic bilayer shifts the resonance curve to a higher\nangle. The variation in the angular position of the reflectivity\nminimum is about 0.5 and is consistent with the experimental\ndata obtained from a \u201ctraditional\u201d SPR setup [35]. A further\nangular shift is apparent when the sensing film is exposed to\nM of copper acetate. Again, these results are similar to\nthose presented previously [35] and suggest that exposure to the\n1162 IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL, VOL. 5, NO. 6, DECEMBER 2005\nFig. 6. SPR curves for an uncoated gold surface, the same surface after\ndeposition of one bilayer of (PEI\/PMAE), and following exposure to a solution\n10 M of copper acetate.\ncopper ions results in a shift in the SPR curve to higher angles\nrather than a broadening of the resonance curve. As noted previ-\nously [10], [35], the refractive index of the metal solution, within\nthe concentration range tested, is close to that of the buffer solu-\ntion and its effect on the SPR curve can be neglected. The mea-\nsured reflectivity change is, therefore, a result of the adsorption\nof the metal cation on the active film. Because of this, an in-\ncrease in thickness and\/or change in the refractive index of the\npolymeric film will shift the SPR curve to higher angles.\nTo detect the reflectivity variation in real time, the position\nof a reference line together with several independent scan lines\nalong the direction (see Fig. 2) was fixed. The angular po-\nsition of a time-drive line, along the direction in Fig. 2, was\nset to the low angle side of the SPR minimum and a time scan\nwas started. In this way, real-time information on the change\nin reflectivity for both the reference and scan lines at a specific\nangle could be obtained. One potential problem was that our\nsensing chips, manufactured under seemingly identical condi-\ntions, exhibited variations in the depth of the resonance curve,\nas evidenced by the results shown in this paper (SPR mimimum\nreflectivities in the range 0.2 to 0.6). We would have expected\nthat the non uniformity of these SPR profiles would affect the\nchemical sensitivity of the devices. However, for the number of\ntests conducted using chips with different resonance mimina,\nand over the limited range of ion concentrations studied, a sig-\nnificant variation in sensitivity was not detected. This suggested\nthat our particular devices possessed a good linearity when op-\nerated to the low angle side of the SPR minimum. However,\nwe believe that better and even more reliable sensing responses\nwill be obtained once the deposition parameters of the organic\nfilms have been fully optimized. An alternative approach might\nalso be used to detect the plasmon shift such as analysis of\nthe entire SPR spectrum via suitable data-processing algorithms\n[13], [36].\nThe results of exposing the PEI\/PMAE and PEI\/PSS chan-\nnels of the multisensor chip to a M copper acetate solu-\nFig. 7. Response of the multichannel sensor chip to copper(II) acetate\nsolution, pH 6.2. The continuous line indicates the reflectivity signal registered\nfrom the PEI\/PMAE active surface while the dashed line shows the signal from\nthe PEI\/PSS film. For clarity, the change in solution inside the sensing cell is\nindicated only for the PEI\/PMAE channel.\ntion are shown in Fig. 7. The initial part of the two reflectivity\nversus time curves (0 \u2013 10 min) shows that both sensing films\nare relatively unresponsive to pH changes from 6.2 (for the tris\nbuffer) to 3.4 (for the HCl). However, when a solution of copper\nacetate at M at pH 6.2 was substituted for the HCl, both\nchannels showed a clear increase in reflectivity. The saturation\nlevel for the reflectivity signal was generally reached after few\nminutes. This corresponds to a steady state during which there\nis equilibrium between the association and dissociation of the\nanalyte with the ligand. This stage, together with the kinetics\nof the sensing reactions, is a function of the specific polymeric\nfilm\/ metal-ion interaction.\nFig. 7 reveals a relatively high sensitivity of the PEI\/PMAE\nbilayer to copper ions, confirming of our previous results [35].\nThe response to PEI\/PSS is less, by a factor of about three. We\nhave suggested that the formation of a PMAE\/metal chelate via\nhydrogen exchange was an important sensing mechanism for Cu\n(II) ions. PMAE has a pincer-like structure with two hydrogen\natoms at the opposite extremes of a half ring and copper ions can\nbecome \u201ctrapped\u201d in such structures. Physical adsorption of the\nmetal ions (e.g., driven by electrostatic attraction between the\nnegatively charged solid\/liquid interface and positively charged\ncopper ions) was also considered to be a significant process.\nFrom the chemical structure of PSS (see Fig. 4), chelate for-\nmation with the metal ions is not expected because the sulfonic\nSO groups in the polymeric PSS do not form a comparable\nmetal-receptive chelate structure. Hence, only a physical attrac-\ntion with the metal driven by Coulombic forces can be consid-\nered. A further factor determining the sensitivity may be the\nmorphology of the polyelectrolyte surface. Fig. 4 reveals a much\nrougher surface for the PEI\/PMAE bilayer surface. The larger\nsurface area may thereby contribute to the enhanced sensitivity\nof this sensing surface over PEI\/PSS.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, the process or regeneration using HCl\nproceeds with both types of bilayer with an almost complete\nrecovery to the original signal level. Repeated exposure to\nPALUMBO et al.: SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE DETECTION OF METAL IONS 1163\ncopper and recovery using HCl produce reasonably repeatable\nresponses.\nFig. 8. Response of the multichannel sensor chip to: (a) nickel(II) acetate\ntetrahydrate solution, pH 6.2, and (b) iron(II) acetate solution, pH 7.6. Both\nmetallic ion solution concentrations 10 M. The continuous line indicates the\nreflectivity signal registered from the PEI\/PMAE active surface while the dashed\nline shows the signal from the PEI\/PSS film. For clarity, the change in solution\ninside the sensing cell is indicated only for the PEI\/PMAE channel.\nThe results for sensing experiments with nickel acetate and\niron acetate solutions at M are contrasted in Fig. 8(a)\nand (b). The nickel solution was prepared at pH 6.2 (as in the\ncase of the copper). An iron solution at the same pH was also\ntested, with no response (data not shown). It was decided, then,\nto use a slightly basic iron acetate solution at pH 7.6. According\nto the literature the extremely pale bluish-green hexaaqua ion\nFe OH will form more aggregated species as the pH of\nthe solution increases [31]. To avoid the formation of hydrated\niron oxide, i.e., the typical red-brown gelatinous precipitations\nthat would give the solution a high degree of turbidity, only fresh\nacetate solutions were used when dealing with iron. As has been\nfound elsewhere [35], the lower affinity of the PEI\/PMAE bi-\nlayer for nickel and iron compared to the copper is apparent\nfrom Fig. 8 (note the difference in the scale of the ordinate in\nFigs. 7 and 8). An even lower response occurs with PEI\/PSS.\nThe differences in sensitivity for the PEI\/PMAE to the metal\nions tested may be explained in terms of the different stability\nconstants for the complexes [37]. At the moment, the behavior\nof the film with PSS as the outer surface is not fully clear.\nHowever, the signal associated with this channel (dashed line\nin Figs. 7 and 8) is much more likely to be due to a low re-\nsponse\u2014related to a poor affinity of the PSS to the metal cations\ninvestigated\u2014than to a generic drift of the signal in output.\nTABLE I\nRESULTS OF EXPOSING PEI\/PMAE AND PEI\/PSS BILAYERS TO VARIOUS\nMETAL ION SOLUTIONS OF CONCENTRATION 2 \u0002 10 M. A POSITIVE\nRESPONSE IS INDICATED BY A TICK AND A NEGATIVE ONE BY A CROSS\nOne interesting feature in Fig. 8 is the oscillations in the re-\nflectivity signal that appear to occur following iron or nickel\nexposure and on subsequent cycling between the tris buffer and\nHCl. This phenomenon was not apparent using copper (Fig. 7),\nor before the sensing layer had been exposed to the metals. It is\nbelieved that interaction with Fe or Ni could have altered the ar-\nchitecture of the PEI\/PMAE film (and, to a limited extent, that\nof the PEI\/PSS film). Maybe, after such metals have dissoci-\nated from the polyelectrolyte films, they leave behind a more\nporous and less uniform surface with more electrostatic active\nsites. Before a process of self-annealing occurs, such modified\narchitectures may be more sensitive to pH variations.\nThe results of exposure of the two-channel sensor to a range\nof metal-ion solutions, all at a concentration of M,\nclose to what is thought to be the detection limit for the equip-\nment, are summarized in Table I. The sensing chip had previ-\nously been exposed to metal cation solutions of Cu, Ni, Zn, Na,\nand Fe at M accounting for the observed pH sensitivity.\nNo response is evident for sodium on both channels, while a\npositive signal is obtained for copper, nickel, and zinc on the\nPEI\/PMAE channel.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nA multichannel single chip SPR system has been used in a\ncomparative sensing study of solutions containing metal ions.\nPolyelectrolyte films, deposited by the LbL self-assembly tech-\nnique were used as the sensing layers; two different bilayer ar-\nchitectures, PEI\/PMAE and PEI\/PSS, were built up on a spe-\ncially designed gold pattern. The two channels have shown inde-\npendent sensing responses to a range of metal ions. The results\naugur well for the development of commercial multichannel,\nsingle chip SPR sensors. Further work will focus on improve-\nments to the sensitivity of the device and on a full understanding\nof the sensing dynamics, for example, a systematic study of the\ninfluence of the films thickness on the sensing behavior together\nwith an investigation of other LbL multilayer systems. Alterna-\ntive data analysis techniques will also improve the reliability and\nresolution of the overall sensing system.\n1164 IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL, VOL. 5, NO. 6, DECEMBER 2005\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the University of Durham for\nthe provision of a studentship, as well as Dr. C.
