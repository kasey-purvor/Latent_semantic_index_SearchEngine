It is shown\nthat, for most subjects at rest breathing spontaneously, the map of successive angles\nreveals a highly deterministic structure after the frequency range below \u223c 0.05 Hz\nhas been filtered out.

Introduction\nModelling the behaviour of real systems is often useful and almost always a challenge.\nLiving systems, within which a large number of processes interact and mix in a complex\nway, while being influenced by different kinds of noise, are especially difficult to treat.\nThere are several ways to attack the problem, including e.g. constructing a mock-up\nbased on prior knowledge of principles governing the function of the system, or creating\na virtual model. The method of modelling that we discuss below is somewhat different\nand consists of constructing a mathematical model in the form of an equation describing\nthe evolution of the system\u2019s state in time. We apply this approach to the human\ncardiovascular system. We focus on the well-known phenomenon of heart rate variability\n(HRV), which manifests itself in the fact that successive R\u2013R intervals extracted from\nan electrocardiogramme usually differ.\nThere has been a long-running debate among researchers applying the tools of time\nseries analysis to HRV data as to the nature of this variability, considered from the\nviewpoint of nonlinear dynamics. The central question has been whether R\u2013R intervals\ncan be attributed to a certain deterministic process perturbed by noise, or it is rather\ndue to some random fluctuation for which only probabilistic laws are valid. Obviously,\nany natural process derives from a complex mixture of deterministic and stochastic\nfactors. Therefore, the above question is actually reduced to the question which of the\ncomponents, stochastic or deterministic, dominates. A desirable ambition could be also\nto reveal the concrete sources of determinism and stochasticity.\nSince variation of R\u2013R intervals is far from being regular, for a long time\nthe phenomenon was attributed to some kind of random process. Conventional\nstatistical methods were applied to characterize it, including e.g. Fourier power spectra,\nautocorrelation functions, mean value and variance. Later, the discovery of the\nphenomenon of dynamical chaos in 1976 [1], led to the fascinating suggestion that the\nbehaviour of many complex physiological signals like the ECG (and consequently HRV as\nwell) [2] may be explicable in terms of chaotic dynamics, that is, they can be described\nby deterministic equations of motion, perhaps influenced by noise. However, further\nstudies seemed to contradict this idea [3, 4], and revealed that HRV possesses many\nfeatures in common with stochastic rather than deterministic processes, e.g. a 1\/f \u03b1\n(\u201cone-over-f\u201d) Fourier power spectrum in the super-low frequency range below 0.005 Hz\n[5, 6, 7] representing a distinctive feature of flicker-noise, a lack of scaling properties\nof the set reconstructed by delay-embedding into a multidimensional space [8], and a\nlack of predictability [9]. Attempts were made to create either deterministic [10, 11]\nor purely stochastic [12] models describing the behaviour of R\u2013R intervals based on a\nknowledge of the physiological mechanisms underlying their variation. The model in the\nform of a discrete map with delay in [10] reproduces qualitatively some known spectral\nproperties of R\u2013R intervals. In [11] a model created in the form of delay differential\nequations was found to demonstrate a rich variety of regimes including chaotic ones. As\ncompared to the R\u2013R intervals of anaesthesized dogs after the removal of trends, it gave\nModelling the dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals 567\na satisfactory description of the observed dynamics as control parameters were changed.\nAll the models mentioned above attempted to capture the behavior of the R\u2013R\nintervals themselves, without expanding them into any components. In spite of some\ndegree of success, none of the models were able to reproduce reliably the full set of\nbasic HRV properties. In [13], however, attention was paid to an angular component of\nthe R\u2013R intervals map in humans undergoing paced respiration at a frequency close to\n0.1 Hz, and distinct structure was found in the angles map. So, it was concluded that\ndeterminism occured in HRV during paced respiration. However, it was inferred that the\n\u201ccomplexity of spontaneous respiratory movements obviously precludes the identification\nof finite-dimensional attractors in heart rate fluctuations within the frequency range of\nbreathing\u201d. An empirical model in the form of one-dimensional autonomous map was\nsuggested to describe approximately the behaviour of the angles of the R\u2013R intervals\nmap, possessing, however, a piecewise-linear return function that is non-smooth (non-\ndifferentiable at several points), which does not seem a very natural way of modelling\nreal processes.\nIn the present paper we demonstrate that removal from human R\u2013R intervals of the\nfrequency range below \u223c 0.05 Hz, measured at rest with spontaneous breathing, allows\nobviously deterministic structure to be revealed in the map of angles. We also model the\nbehaviour of the angles with the help of a map that was previously derived for the case\nof weakly interacting periodic oscillators [14]. We show that only the angles of the R\u2013R\nintervals map exhibit highly deterministic behaviour, whereas the corresponding radii\nreveal no obvious low-dimensional structure either before or after filtration. Finally, we\ndiscuss the results obtained.\n2. Description of the model.\nIt is known that several oscillatory processes are involved in the dynamics of the\ncardiovascular system, each of them having a characteristic timescale (period). There\nare, for example, heart contraction, respiration, and myogenic activity of smooth\nmuscles. Obviously, all these processes interact with each other, and their interaction is\nreflected in the Fourier and wavelet spectra of many known cardiovascular signals [15],\nincluding the ECG, where several characteristic peaks can be detected.\nFrom the viewpoint of oscillation theory, the interaction of m periodic processes\ngives rise to quasiperiodic motion (in general), which can be represented as an m-\ndimensional torus in the state space of a dynamical system. The same torus can be also\nmodelled by applying one or several external periodic driving forces to a system with\npurely periodic oscillations. An illustration of how a two-dimensional torus is formed is\ngiven in Fig. 1. In this case, if the interacting periodic processes are not synchronous,\nthe trajectory fills the whole torus surface and is never closed. If they are synchronous,\nthe trajectory lying on the torus surface is closed after one or several windings.\nIn general analysis of the motion on a hypersurface of an m-dimensional torus in\na high-dimensional state space of an original dynamical system with continuous time is\nModelling the dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals 568\na nontrivial task. To simplify consideration, a Poincare\u00b4 map is often introduced [16] as\nfollows (Fig. 2(a) illustrates the simplest case of a two-dimensional torus): a surface is\nselected in such a way that it intersects all of the system\u2019s trajectories transversely (at a\nnonzero angle, i.e. does not touch them). The points of intersection in only one direction\nare selected strictly preserving their order in time, to form the Poincare\u00b4 map. Such a\nmap contains the complete dynamical information about the motion in the original\nsystem except information about the real time, since instead of the original continous\ntime t only discrete time i is available. A Poincare\u00b4 map of a two-dimensional torus is\nin general a closed curve, often called a \u201ccircle\u201d. If two periodic processes interact and\nare not synchronized, the map points fill the whole circle. If they are synchronized, the\nmap consists of a finite number of points lying on this circle. In Fig. 2(b) a Poincare\u00b4\nmap is shown for the synchronous case consisting of three points on a circle shown by\ndashed line and being the section of the torus surface.\nAn alternative type of discrete data can also be used which, unlike Poincare\u00b4 maps,\npreserve information about the real time of the system, namely, return times. The\nreturn times of the system are defined as the time intervals between the trajectory\u2019s\nintersection in one direction with the secant plane. One can also obtain return times\nin an easier way from a one-dimensional signal coming from the system under study by\ndefining some threshold and taking the time intervals between successive crossings of\nit by the signal in one direction (for example, from above to below), as in Fig. 1(c).\nAn example of return times which is well-known in physiology are the R\u2013R intervals\nextracted from a human ECG, as illustrated by Fig. 3.\nIt is known that a map of successive return times is qualitatively similar to the\nPoincare\u00b4 map of the system under study [17], provided that the latter is deterministic,\ni.e. that its changes of state can be described by some evolution equations. A famous\nexample of such a map in physiology is the scattergramme obtained from R\u2013R intervals.\nLet us consider a return times map of a typical dynamical system within which\ntwo periodic processes interact weakly. We can define an angle \u03c6i and a radius ri for\nevery point of the map as shown in Fig. 2(b). If the processes are synchronous, one will\nobserve a discrete set of map points, and, consequently, a discrete set of possible values\nof angles \u03c6i. If the processes are not synchronous, the angles \u03c6i will be allowed to take\nany value within [\u2212pi : pi].\nIn [14] a model was derived for the dynamics of angles of return times map of a\nperiodic self-oscillatory system forced by an arbitrary number of harmonic signals. We\nnow give a brief description of how it was derived.\nConsider a periodic self-oscillator whose natural oscillations (in the absence of any\nforcings) are of frequency \u03c90 and amplitude R. If the nonlinearity in the oscillator\nis weak then, in the absence of forcings, as time tends to infinity, its signal can be\napproximated by a sinusoidal function of time, and its oscillations correspond in phase\nspace to a closed loop (Fig. 1(a)). Now let the oscillator be forced by a sinusoidal signal\nwith frequency \u2126 and amplitude r (Fig. 1(b)). If the forcing is weak, r \u001c R, a signal\nx(t) coming from the resultant forced oscillator can be approximated by a sum of two\nModelling the dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals 569\nterms: one sine term describing oscillations with frequency \u03c9 and amplitude R and a\nsecond sine term describing oscillations with the frequency of the external forcing \u2126 and\nits amplitude r (Fig. 1(c)), that is:\nx(t) = R sin \u03c9t + r sin \u2126t, r \u001c R. (1)\nAs a result of the forcing a two-dimensional torus is born (Fig. 1(c), right). A well-\nknown phenomenon which can take place in forced periodic oscillators, as well as in\nmutually coupled oscillators, is synchronization. This means that forcing (or coupling)\ncan change the frequency of oscillations in the system so that it is no longer equal to\nthe natural frequency and appears to be related to the frequency of forcing (or to the\nfrequency of the coupled oscillator) as integer numbers. To quantify the interaction\nbetween two oscillators a rotation number is introduced, defined as the ratio of their\nfrequencies during interaction. This number can be rational or irrational\u00a7. If it is\nrational and equals n\nm\n, then one can say that n\nm\nsynchronization is taking place.\nThus, the frequency \u03c9 in (1) coincides with the natural frequency \u03c90 in the absence\nof synchronization. In the presence of synchronization, it is shifted in the direction\ndefined by the forcing. If the oscillations are synchronized by the forcing, the rotation\nnumber of the whole system under consideration, here denoted as \u03be = \u2126\n\u03c9\n, is equal to n\nm\n,\nwhere n, m are integers.\nThe return times of our system are defined as the time intervals between successive\ncrossings by the signal x(t) of the threshold x = 0 in one direction (Fig. 1(c)). After\nsome calculations, the return times are obtained explicitly using the fact that the forcing\nis weak (details are given in [14]). After that, the map of return times is introduced,\nthe origin is placed at the centre of mass of the map, and the angles \u03c6i are defined as\nshown in Fig. 2(b). Finally, the explicit map describing the dynamics of angles for weak\nharmonic forcing is found to take the simple form:\n\u03c6i = arctan (2 cos 2pi\u03be \u2212 cot \u03c6i\u22121). (2)\nSimilarly, for any number n of sinusoidal forcings with different frequencies \u2126j and small\namplitudes Aj (j = 1, . . . , n) the signal x(t) coming from the forced oscillator can be\napproximated by:\nx(t) = R sin \u03c9t +\nn\u2211\nj=1\nAj sin \u2126jt, Aj \u001c R (3)\nand the following map for angles is obtained:\n\u00a7 A number is rational, if it can be represented as a fraction of two integer numbers n and m, i.e. n\nm\n,\nand irrational if the latter is impossible. Two numbers are rationally connected if their ratio equals the\nratio of integer numbers; and irrationally connected, if they are not.\nModelling the dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals 570\n\u03c6i = arctan {2 cos\u03981 \u2212 cot \u03c6i\u22121\n+ 2[\nn\u2211\nj=2\n\u03b2j cos (i\u0398j +\n\u0398j\n2\n)(cos \u0398j \u2212 cos \u03981)]\n\u00d7 [\nn\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b2j cos (i\u0398j +\n\u0398j\n2\n)]\u22121} (4)\n\u03b2j =\nAj\nA1\nsin (\u0398j\/2)\nsin (\u03981\/2)\n, \u03b21 = 1.\nHere, \u0398j = 2pi\u03bej, while \u03bej =\n\u2126j\n\u03c9\ndefines the \u201cpartial\u201d rotation number. For two forcing\nsignals, the formulae take the form:\n\u03c6i = arctan {2 cos\u03981 \u2212 cot\u03c6i\u22121 + 2\u03b22[ cos \u03982 \u2212 cos \u03981]\u00d7\n\u00d7 [\u03b22 +\ncos(i\u03981 +\n\u03981\n2\n)\ncos (i\u03982 +\n\u03982\n2\n)\n]\u22121}, \u03b22 =\nA2\nA1\nsin \u03982\n2\nsin \u03981\n2\n. (5)\nAll the above maps (2), (4) and (5) are defined via the arctan function which varies\nbetween [\u2212pi\n2\n; pi\n2\n]. However, it is obvious that the angles \u03c6i are defined in such a way\nthat they will vary within [\u2212pi; pi]. To resolve this contradiction, we redefine the right-\nhand sides of our equation in such a way, that for all positive arguments \u03c6i\u22121 we preserve\ntheir values, and for all negative ones we deduct pi. In terms of their physical meaning\nall the above maps are circle maps [18, 19, 20], (2) being autonomous, and (4) and (5)\nbeing non-autonomous (meaning that the right-hand side depends explicitly on discrete\ntime i). We will follow the traditional representation by plotting all such maps, both\ntheoretical and experimental, within a square with the limits [\u2212pi : pi].\nNumerical simulations show that, provided the interaction is weak, the maps for\nangles of return times either for the forced oscillator or for coupled oscillators fit closely\nthe theoretically predicted maps (2) or (5) for either two or three processes involved,\nrespectively. Some examples of how the map (5), describing interaction between three\nprocesses, looks are illustrated in Fig. 4. Let us define that process whose amplitude\nis largest in the given one-dimensional dataset as the main rhythm, and denote its\nfrequency as \u03c9.\nIn Figs. 4 (a) and (b) the frequencies of forcing signals are selected to be irrationally\nconnected with the basic frequency \u03c9 = 1 and with each other in order to show what\nthe maps look like in the absence of any synchronization. Fig. 4(a) shows a map for\nthe case of forcing with a frequency \u21261 = 0.1012032011 . . . (a random sequence of\n0,1,2,3 after \u201d0.1\u201d) at relatively large amplitude A1 = 0.1, while the second forcing\nwith frequency \u21262 = 0.3102130202 . . . (a random sequence of 0,1,2,3 after \u201d0.3\u201d) has a\nsmaller amplitude A2 = 0.012. The whole map is concentrated within the vicinity of the\none-dimensional curve defining the return function\u2016 of (2) for \u03be = \u2126\n\u03c9\n= 0.1012032011 . . .\n\u2016 A return function of a discrete one-dimensional autonomous map (whose right-hand part does not\ndepend on discrete time i) is the function in the right-hand part depending on its variable argument\nwhich in our example is \u03c6i\u22121.\nModelling the dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals 571\n(grey line). Thus, the appearance of the map for angles gives an immediate idea of the\napproximate frequency ratio of the dominant processes. One can see that the points in\nthis example fill the whole allowed space densely, though with different probability, and\nthat no one-dimensional structures can be observed. This is due to the absence of any\nsynchronization between the processes involved.\nIn Fig. 4(b) a map is given for the case when interaction between the process\nwith frequency \u21261 = 0.3102130202 . . . (a random sequence of 0,1,2,3 after \u201c0.3\u201d)\nhas a relatively large amplitude A1 = 0.2, while the process with frequency \u21262 =\n0.1012032011 . . . (a random sequence of 0,1,2,3 after \u201d0.1\u201d) has the smaller amplitude\nA2 = 0.1. The situation is the same as in Fig. 4(a), apart from the fact that the\ninteraction of the main rhythm with the process of frequency \u21261 now prevails, and the\nmap lies in the vicinity of the return function of (2) with \u03be = 0.3102130202 . . . (grey\nline).\nFigs. 4 (c) and (d) illustrate what happens when only two out of the three\nprocesses are synchronous. For Fig. 4(c) the two rhythms with smaller amplitudes\nare synchronized with each other and neither is synchronous with the main rhythm.\nThe value of \u03c9 is chosen to be 1.0103210 . . . (a random sequence of 0,1,2,3 after \u201d1.\u201d).\n\u21261 = 0.1 and \u21262 = 0.2, A1 = 0.1, A2 = 0.11. One observes two one-dimensional curves\npointing explicitly to the existence of synchronization between the two minor rhythms.\nThe grey line shows the return function of (2) for \u03be = 0.2.\nIn Fig. 4(d) synchronization between the main rhythm and one of the minor rhythms\noccurs. Here, \u03c9 = 1, \u21261 =\n1\n3\n, \u21262 = 0.2103021 . . . (a random sequence of 0,1,2,3 after\n\u201d0.2\u201d), A1 = 0.2, A2 = 0.1. The existence of synchronisation between the main rhythm\nand the process with \u21261 is revealed by the presence of three closed loops in the angles\nmap. The number of closed loops gives the denominator 3 of the corresponding rotation\nnumber \u03be1 =\n1\n3\n; the loops can be seen to lie on the return function of (2) for \u03be = 1\n3\n(grey\nline).\n3. Dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals\n3.1. Data description\nAs is widely appreciated, the Fourier spectrum of an ECG measured for a healthy human\n(Fig. 5) contains several distinct peaks at different frequencies, namely, the main peak\nat the average heart rate fahr, a peak of smaller amplitude associated with respiration\nfresp, a peak at approximately f2 = 0.1 Hz associated with baroreflex or myogenic\nactivity, and two more peaks at frequencies 0.03 and 0.01 Hz with substantially lower\namplitudes [15] (not shown). Qualitatively the same power spectrum is obtained from\nR\u2013R intervals computed by means of the technique described in [21] (Fig. 5(a)). Namely,\nthe spectrum of discrete process known through the values of interspike (R\u2013R) intervals\ncan be estimated as follows: a delta-function is assumed to be placed at every time\nmoment ti when an R peak appears in ECG, so that the whole signal can be represented\nModelling the dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals 572\nas x(t) =\n\u2211\n\u03b4(t \u2212 ti) and subjected to almost analytical calculation of the Fourier\ntransform. This method allows one to obtain an approximation of the Fourier spectrum\nof the actual ECG that produced the given R\u2013R intervals, with the real frequencies on\nthe abscissa axis. Note that the main component, corresponding to basic heart rhythm,\nis then present in the spectrum. In addition to the peaks, as mentioned in Introduction,\na 1\/f\u03b1 (\u201cone-over-f\u201d) behaviour of the Fourier power spectrum is observed in the range\nof super-low frequencies below \u223c 0.005 Hz. The existence of several spectral peaks is in\nitself often taken as evidence for the presence of several processes interacting within the\nsingle system. Following this hypothesis, let us apply the technique of plotting the map\nfor angles, extracted from the map of successive R\u2013R intervals, to study the interactions\nbetween different processes.\n3.2. Data pre-processing\nAs shown in Section 2, the shape of the map for angles is largely determined by the\nratio of the frequencies of the processes whose interaction is the strongest compared to\ntheir interaction with other processes. Usually, in the R\u2013R intervals of healthy people\none observes a very slow but noticeable floating of the average value (Fig. 5(b)). It\nis related to the very low frequencies mentioned above, which are much less than the\naverage heart rate and thus lead to a rotation number close to zero. The map of angles\nextracted from the map of original R\u2013R intervals (Fig. 6, upper row) thus reveals this\nfloating immediately . The effect was important in all the datasets which we consider\nin this paper, and the whole map lies in the vicinity of the return function of (2) for the\nvalue of \u03be = 0 (grey line). Over small observation times, of the order of minutes, this\nfloating can be regarded as nonstationarity. In order to consider as stationary motion\nas possible, and to focus on interactions of the main heart rhythm with respiration and\nthe process of frequency \u223c 0.1 Hz, it is therefore reasonable to try to filter out the\ncorresponding frequency range, that is, the range below \u223c 0.05 Hz.\nFor this purpose we use two methods of filtering in this paper. Denote a discrete\nsequence of R\u2013R intervals as x(i). The first method consists of computing the analogue\nof the second derivative of the original time series x(i):\nxder(i) =\nx(i + 1) + x(i\u2212 1)\u2212 2x(i)\n2\n. (6)\nWe will refer to this procedure as the method of derivatives. The second method is\nslightly more intricate and consists of the following procedure: (i) we find all the local\nmaxima xmax(j) and minima xmin(j) of the time series x(i); and (ii) each datapoint x(i)\nlocated between the j-th local maximum xmax(j) and the j\nth local minimum xmin(j), or\nbetween the jth minimum and the (j+1)th maximum, including the extrema themselves,\nis replaced by a new value xdiff(i)\nxdiff(i) = x(i)\u2212\n1\n2\n(xmax(j)\u2212 xmin(j)), or\nxdiff(i) = x(i)\u2212\n1\n2\n(xmax(j + 1)\u2212 xmin(j)), (7)\nModelling the dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals 573\nrespectively. Thus, the filter (7) simply deducts from every datapoint the local average,\nand in what follows we will call this technique the method of differences.\nThe results of applying these two filters are slightly different and we compute the\npower spectrum for every filtered data set xder or xdiff in order to control the effect of\nfiltering. To compute the Fourier spectrum from filtered R\u2013R intervals we just add to\nxder or xdiff the average value of unfiltered R\u2013R intervals, and then proceed in the same\nway as for original, non-filtered data [21]. In Fig. 6 (middle row) the results of filtering\nby means of derivatives are given, while Fig. 6 (lower row) illustrates the workability\nof the differences technique. The methods of differences and derivatives both remove\nthe trend from the data. However, the noisy background of the Fourier power spectrum\nseems on average to be more uniform after filtration by derivatives, than by differences,\nalthough the use of derivatives leads to a significant decrease of the lower-frequency\nrange (around 0.1 Hz and less). In both cases, all three dominating frequencies and\ntheir combinations are clearly seen after filtration, but the ratios of their amplitudes\nappear to be slightly different.\nExtract the angles \u03c6i from the maps of filtered R\u2013R intervals and plot the map for\nangles (Fig. 6, middle and lower rows). The two ways of filtering appear to result in\nsomewhat different behaviours of the angles \u03c6i. For the case considered, both angles\nmaps seem to lie in the vicinity of the same curve, but points are placed with some phase\nshift. The differences method leads to a more smeared map, while that of derivatives\nreveals the structure better. In Fig. 6 (middle and lower rows) the points of both the\nfiltered angles maps lie close to the one-dimensional continuous curve that represents\nthe return function of map (2) for \u03be = 1\n3\nwhich is shown by the grey line. They seem to\nbe formed by three fairly isolated clouds of points, thus testifying to the presence of 1\n3\nsynchronization between heart rate and the most dominant of the other processes (which\nin the present case seems to be respiration). For further analysis we select whichever\nfilter leads to the more pronounced structure in the map for angles. Of course, neither\nof the filtration techniques described is perfect, and other techniques might be used\ninstead to obtain similar or perhaps even better results.\nSeveral typical examples of angles maps arising in filtered human R\u2013R intervals are\nshown in Figs. 7 and 8. All the datasets were obtained in the course of measurements\nundertaken to study the possibility of synchronizing the human heart rate by means\nof weak external periodic forcing in the form of a sequence of sound and light pulses.\nThe light pulse was a red square appearing on the screen of a computer for 0.1 sec, and\nthe sound was generated by the computer speakers and had the same duration. The\nfrequency of the sound was 440 Hz, corresponding to the musical note \u201cla\u201d. The sound\nwas weak enough not to cause noticeable changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Two\nkinds of forcing were studied, namely: (i) a periodic sequence of pulses with a frequency\nclose to, but slightly differing from, the average heart rate of the given subject at rest;\nand (ii) a sequence of pulses whose current period was equal to the current R\u2013R interval\nof another subject at rest. Each dataset was measured over an interval of 5 minutes\nfor a young healthy subject resting in an arm-chair. The ECG sampling rate was 180\nModelling the dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals 574\nHz. Details of the experiment and the results were presented in [22], where the forcing\nsignals were compared with response signals by means of phase difference computations\nas in [23].\nHere we present the results of processing of the same data using our new technique.\nNote that we study only the intrinsic structure of each HRV signal, and its change in\nresponse to forcing, without comparing it to any other signals. In Fig. 7 the plots in\nthe 1st column are the angles maps extracted from filtered R\u2013R intervals of subjects\nwithout forcing. The plots in the 2nd column are the angles maps for the same subjects\nunder periodic forcing at a frequency being 1 per cent smaller than the average heart\nrate of the subject without forcing. The third column shows Fourier power spectra for\nthe same subject without forcing (shaded) and under forcing (solid line). As one can\nsee from the spectra, the main peak shifts to the left as a result of the forcing in each\ncase.\nIn Fig. 8 the plots in the 1st column are the angles maps of unforced subjects\n(different from those in Fig. 7), while the plots in the 2nd column are the angles maps\nof the same subjects under aperiodic forcing defined by the R\u2013R intervals of another\nperson. As in Fig. 7, the third column shows Fourier power spectra for the same subject\nwithout forcing (shaded) and under forcing (solid line). One can see that, in each\ncase, a distinct structure is revealed in the angles maps. One can make the following\nobservations:\n(i) In spite of its weakness, the forcing can cause a noticeable change in the structure of\nangles map pointing to the changes in the ratio of interacting dominating frequencies\n(subjects 2, 4, 5, 6). Since the shape of the angles maps is mainly defined by\ninteraction between the main heart rhythm and respiration, we can conclude that\nit is mainly the ratio of their frequencies that is changed under forcing.\n(ii) In some subjects the angles map reveals several distinct clouds of points, which\nconstitute evidence of synchronization between the main heart rhythm and\nrespiration (in subject 1, 3 clouds; in subject 2 at rest, 5 clouds, and under forcing 3\nclouds; in subject 3 under forcing, 3 clouds; in subject 4 under forcing, 4 clouds; in\nsubject 7 both at rest and under forcing, 3 clouds). In many cases the appearance\nof these clouds is caused by the external forcing.\nThis apparently implies that even such a weak forcing generally increases the\nstrength of interaction between the main heart rhythm and respiration, resulting\nin their synchronization.\n(iii) Many experimental angles maps can be quite accurately approximated by the\ntheoretically derived models (2) or (5) (actually, for all subjects except those\nmentioned below in item (iv)).\nThis demonstrates that the interactions of respiration, and the process with\nfrequency close to 0.1 Hz, with the main heart rhythm are typically weak. We\nconsider in Section 3.3 below two detailed examples of modelling of such maps.\n(iv) In some subjects the angles maps cannot be satisfactorily described by the\nModelling the dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals 575\ntheoretical models (2) or (5), although they possess a pronounced structure (see\nsubject 4 under forcing, and subject 7).\nThis means that, in some healthy subjects, the interaction of respiration with\nthe main heart rhythm is relatively strong, an inference that is supported by\nthe presence of second harmonics of the respiration frequency fresp in the Fourier\nspectrum (it is clearly seen in subject 4, but is much less pronounced in subject 7).\nUnlike the angles \u03c6i of R\u2013R intervals, the radii ri which are extracted from the\nsame data do not reveal any obvious low-dimensional structure, at least in their two-\ndimensional map. An example of a radii map is presented in Fig. 9, for which the radii\nri were extracted from R\u2013R intervals of subject 2 under periodic forcing. The radii\nobtained from either original (a) or filtered (b), (c) R\u2013R intervals do not display any\nobvious deterministic behaviour, although the corresponding angles are highly regular\n(see Fig. 7, upper row).\n3.3. Data Modeling\nLet us illustrate how the maps (2) or (5) can model the angles of filtered human R\u2013R\nintervals. In Fig. 10 an analysis of healthy human HRV data is illustrated, following\nfiltration by the differences technique. Fig. 10(a) shows the Fourier power spectrum of\na filtered dataset. It contains two distinct frequencies at fahr \u2248 0.82 Hz and fresp \u2248 0.16\nHz. Points of angles map (Fig. 10(b)) are placed around a curve defining the return\nfunction of map (2) for \u03be = 0.2 (thin solid line). Moreover, one can observe 5 clouds\nof points lying on this curve, testifying to the presence of 1\n5\nsynchronization between\nthe main heart rhythm and respiration. Note that the rotation number \u03be = 1\n5\ndefining\nsynchronization differs slightly from the actual ratio of fresp and fahr, in full agreement\nwith the theory of effective phase synchronization [25].\nNow let us try to reproduce this map by means of modelling. Because there\nare basically two processes involved in the interaction, we choose map (2). Note,\nthat the resulting dynamics of this map does not depend on the values of frequencies\nindependently, but only on their ratio. For example, the values \u03c9 = 1.4 and \u2126 = 0.7 will\ngive the same result as \u03c9 = 1 and \u2126 = 0.5 because their ratio \u03be = \u2126\n\u03c9\nis the same. Bearing\nthis fact in mind, we select the following set of parameters: \u03c9 = 1, \u21261 = 0.2 (to obtain\nthe rotation number \u03be1 =\n1\n5\n). To simulate a real situation let us assume that random\nnoise influences the value of respiration frequency and let its variance be 0.19. Let us\nalso add a random term being Gaussian white noise to the right-hand part of equation\n(2) with variance 0.01. Iteration of the obtained map and removal of a transient process\ngives the phase portrait shown in Fig. 10(c). It looks very similar to the experimental\nangles map in Fig. 10(b).\nConsider another example illustrated in Fig. 11. The Fourier power spectrum (Fig.\n11(a)) of R\u2013R intervals filtered by differences technique contains three independent\nfrequencies and their combinations, namely, fahr \u2248 1.37 Hz, fresp \u2248 0.24 Hz and f2 \u2248 0.1\nHz, and the intensity of fresp is larger than that of f2. No clouds of points or stripes\nModelling the dynamics of angles of human R\u2013R intervals 576\n(like in Fig. 4(c)) can be distinguished in the angles map (Fig. 11(b)), so it seems that\nneither of the processes involved is synchronized with the other. Since there are three\nbasic processes involved in the interaction here, we choose the map (5) as a model. Set\nthe parameter values as follows: frequencies \u03c9 = 1, \u21261 = 0.18 and \u21262 = 0.074, and\namplitudes A1 = 0.1 and A2 = 0.05. Let noise modulate most of the parameters of the\nmodel as follows: the values of frequencies \u21261 and \u21262 with intensities 0.43, the values\nof amplitudes A1 with intensity 0.41 and A2 with intensity 0.05. Let also add to the\nright-hand part of equation noise with intensity 0.1. The phase portrait of the resulting\nmap, shown in Fig. 11(c), looks remarkably similar to the experimental results shown\nin Fig. 11(b).\n4. Discussion and Conclusion.\nIt seems that the theoretically obtained maps (2) and (5) are able to model successfully\nthe angular part of R\u2013R intervals from healthy humans, provided that contributions\nfrom the frequency range below \u223c 0.05 Hz are first removed by filtration.\nThe possibility of modelling the behaviour of experimental human R\u2013R intervals\nthat we have demonstrated is interesting, not only in itself, but also because it\ncontributes to the long-term discussion about the fundamental nature of human heart\nrate variability. The fact that the angular component of experimental R\u2013R intervals\ncan be successfully modelled by a dynamical system serves as a strong argument for\nthe deterministic nature of the interactions between the processes governing heart rate\nvariability. regular (periodic or is in there radial component of R\u2013R intervals does not\nexhibit any obvious low-dimensional determinism. Thus, we can distinguish between\ntwo separate components of heart rate variability \u2013 one that displays highly regular\nbehaviour, and one that does not display any obvious regularity at all.\n5.
