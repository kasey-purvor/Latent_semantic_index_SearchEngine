A measurable wavelength shift \nwas observed at temperatures as low as 20K. \n \n \nKeywords: Fibre optic sensor. fibre grating, long period grating, temperature, cryogenic. \n 3\nFibre optic long period gratings (LPGs) exhibit a number of unique features which make them \nattractive candidates for in-line filtering applications in telecommunications, and for application as \nsensor elements1. A long period grating consists of a period modulation of the refractive index of \nthe core of an optical fibre. The period of the modulation is typically in the range 10 \u03bcm to 1000 \n\u03bcm. The correspondingly small grating wave-vector promotes coupling between co-propagating \nmodes of the optical fibre. In the case of single mode fibre, the coupling takes place between the \nguided mode and co-propagating cladding modes. Efficient coupling is possible to only a subset of \nthe cladding modes2. As the cladding modes suffer from high attenuation, the transmission \nspectrum of an optical fibre containing a LPG contains a number of attenuation bands, each \ncorresponding to coupling to a different cladding mode.  \n \nThe phase matching wavelengths are governed by the expression3 \n( ) ( ) \u039b\u23a5\u23a6\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\u23a1 \u2212= \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb iclneffn         ( 1 ) \n \nwhere neff(\u03bb) is the effective refractive index of the propagating core mode at wavelength \u03bb, nicl (\u03bb) \nis the refractive index of the ith cladding mode and \u039b is the period of the LPG. Figure 1 shows the \ntransmission spectrum of a LPG of period 400\u03bcm, length 40mm, fabricated in B-Ge codoped fibre \nwith a cut off wavelength 650 nm, exhibiting the characteristic attenuation bands. \n \nEnvironmental parameters that differentially change the effective indices of the modes of the core \nand cladding, or that change the period of the LPG, result in a shift in the central wavelengths of \nthe attenuation bands, facilitating the development of sensor systems, or tuneable filters. The \nsensitivity of LPGs to environmental parameters is influenced by the period of the LPG, by the \norder of the cladding mode to which coupling takes place and by the composition of the optical \nfibre4,5. This combination of influences allows the fabrication of LPGs that have a range of \n 4\nresponses to a particular measurand - a single LPG may have attenuation bands that have a positive \nsensitivity to a measurand, others that are insensitive to the measurand and others with a negative \nsensitivity6. \n \nThe temperature response of fibre optic long period gratings has been extensively studied. LPGs \nwith temperature insensitive attenuation bands have been demonstrated in LPGs with short period \n(40\u03bcm)3. LPGs fabricated in standard telecommunications optical fibre exhibit temperature \nsensitivities in the range 3 nm\/100 \u00b0C to 10 nm\/100 \u00b0C6, an order of magnitude larger than the \ntemperature sensitivity of FBG sensors. For the fabrication of high resolution temperature sensors, \nor to create widely tuneable filters, a number of techniques for further enhancing the sensitivity \nhave been reported, including the use of fibres of different composition4,5, different geometries7 \nand the use of polymer coatings8. \n \nIn this paper the thermal response of the LPG transmission spectrum is investigated at temperatures \nin the range 4.2 K to 300 K. The thermal response of fibre Bragg gratings at cryogenic \ntemperatures has been investigated previously9,10,11, showing that at temperatures below \napproximately 100 K, the spectrum is temperature insensitive.  To the authors' knowledge, there \nhave been no previously reported studies of the response of LPGs at cryogenic temperatures. \n \nAn LPG, with parameters described previously, was fabricated by exposing the fibre to the output \nof a quadrupled Nd:YAG laser operating at 266 nm through an amplitude mask of period 400\u03bcm. \nThe transmission spectrum is shown in figure 1. The use of a fibre with a low cut off wavelength \nresults in the attenuation bands of interest being located within the wavelength response of silicon \ndetectors. The transmission spectrum was monitored by coupling the output from a white light \nsource, a Tungsten Halogen lamp, into the optical fiber containing the LPG and coupling the output \nfrom the distal end of the fiber into a PC interfaced CCD spectrometer (Ocean Optics S2000). The \n 5\nspectrometer disperses the spectrum over the 2048 pixels of the CCD linear array, offering a \nmeasurement range from 500 nm to 1100 nm. The integration time may be controlled to optimise \nthe SNR, the minimum integration time being 1 ms. The central wavelengths of the attenuation \nbands were determined using a polynomial fit to the spectral data, giving a resolution of 0.02 nm. \nThe LPG was inserted into a cryostat and mounted such that it remained straight throughout the \nexperiment to avoid bend induced changes in the transmission spectrum12. This was achieved by \nplacing the region of fibre containing the LPG within a glass tube of internal diameter 1 mm.  The \nLPG spectrum and the output from Rhodium Iron temperature sensors were monitored as the \ncryostat was cooled from room temperature to 4.2 K, over a period of 2 hours. Monitoring the \nresponse during both cool down and warm up indicated that the response was reproducible.  The \ncryostat consists of an outer vacuum jacket (OVC), a sample space which is a liquid Helium (LHe) \nreservoir and a cylindrical liquid Nitrogen (LN2) jacket which is built into the OVC and surrounds \nthe LHe can.   The cryostat was pre-cooled by filling the LHe can and the LN2 jacket with LN2.  \nThe system is typically left overnight in this state.  After this period, any LN2 remaining in the LHe \ncan is blown out using He gas and the sample space is cooled to the magnet operating temperature \n(T \u2264 4.2K) by filling with LHe.   \n \nThe measured response is shown in figure 2, where the wavelength shift of attenuation band 5 \n(corresponding to coupling to the 5th order cladding mode) is plotted as a function of temperature \nduring cool down from 280 K to 4.2 K. The response is approximately linear down to 77K, with \ngradient 0.2nm\/K. Below 77K the temperature sensitivity decreases, but, as shown in figure 3, the \nLPG still displays a measurable thermal sensitivity at temperatures as low as 20K. The feature \nbetween 220 and 250 K is a result of a restriction of the Nitrogen flow which occurred at 200 K, \nbefore the Nitrogen had condensed, and resulted in a rapid increase in temperature during which \nthe LPG and the Rhodium Iron temperature sensors were not in thermal equilibrium. The \n 6\nrestriction was removed, and cooling recommenced. The feature at 80K is a result of a rapid warm \nup that occurred as the liquid Nitrogen was blown out.  \n \nFBGs have been shown previously to be largely temperature insensitive below 100K11. The reason \nfor the extended range exhibited by the LPGs is the dependence of the coupling wavelength upon \nthe difference between the index of the core and cladding. The doping of the core of the fibre with \nBoron and Germanium to enhance photosensitivity might be expected to provide a significant \ndifferential thermal response of core and cladding.  \n \nIn summary, the thermal response of a LPG has been monitored from room temperature to 4.2 K. \nThe LPG attenuation bands exhibited linear temperature dependence from room temperature down \nto 77K. Below 77K, a thermal response was measurable to below 20 K.  \n 7\nReferences \n1 V. Bhatia and A.M. Vengsarakar, Optical fibre long-period grating sensors, Opt.Lett. 21, 692-\n694 (1996). \n2 T.
