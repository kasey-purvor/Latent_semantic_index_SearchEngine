Recently, Grunevald et al. [10] have shown\nthat the analogue holds for finite-dimensional Lie algebras over infinite fields of characteristic\ngreater than 5. It is a natural question to ask to what extent the two-generated subalgebras\ndetermine the structure of the algebra. It is to this question that this paper is addressed. Here,\nwe consider the classes of strongly-solvable and of supersolvable Lie algebras, and the property\nof triangulability.\nKeywords Lie algebra, two generator, solvable, supersolvable, triangulable.\nAMS 2000 Mathematics subject classification 17B05, 17B30\n1 Introduction.\nLet P be a certain property that a subalgebra of a Lie algebra may possess. A task is to obtain\ninformation on the structure of a Lie algebra L all of whose two-generated proper subalgebras\npossess the property P. Given a subalgebra S of L, we distinguish two types of properties that\nS may possess: one type is that S belong to a certain class C of Lie algebras, in this case the\nclass C will be identified with the property; the other one is that S be immersed in L in a certain\nway. In this paper we will consider properties of these two types. Of the first type, we will\nconsider the classes of strongly-solvable and supersolvable Lie algebras and of the other type the\nproperty that S be triangulable on L.\nIn section 2, we give some preliminary results and we collect some known ones on important\nclasses of Lie algebras. Most of them will be used in the sequel\nIn section 3, we consider the classes of strongly-solvable and of supersolvable Lie algebras. We\nprove that if L is a solvable Lie algebra all of whose two-generated proper subalgebras are strongly\n1Supported by DGI Grant BFM2000-1049-C02-01\n1\nsolvable (resp. supersolvable) then either L is two-generated and every proper subalgebra of L\nis strongly solvable (resp. supersolvable) or else L is strongly solvable (resp. supersolvable). In\nthe strongly-solvable case, we also prove that if L is non-solvable, F is infinite and char(F) > 5,\nthen L is two-generated, every proper subalgebra of L is strongly solvable and L\/\u03c6(L) is simple\n(where \u03c6(L) denotes the largest ideal of L contained in every maximal subalgebra of L).\nIn section 4, we prove that a solvable Lie algebra L is triangulable whenever every two-generated\nproper subalgebra of L is triangulable on L. Also, we prove that if every proper subalgebra of\na Lie algebra L is triangulable on L but L itself is not, then L is two-generated and L\/\u03c6(L) is\nsimple. Moreover, we give some information on the structure of a simple Lie algebra L all of\nwhose proper subalgebras are triangulable on L. In particular we obtain that such a Lie algebra\nis two-generated.\nThroughout L will denote a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field F . There will be no\nassumptions on F other than those specified in individual results. We shall call L supersolvable\nif there is a chain 0 = L0 \u2282 L1 \u2282 . . . \u2282 Ln\u22121 \u2282 Ln = L, where Li is an i-dimensional ideal of L.\nWe shall call L strongly solvable if its derived subalgebra L2 is nilpotent. It is well known that\nsupersolvable =\u21d2 strongly \u2212 solvable =\u21d2 solvable\nFor algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero, these three classes of Lie algebras coincide\n(Lie\u2019s theorem). For fields of characteristic zero, every solvable Lie algebra is strongly solvable.\nThere are well-known examples of solvable Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields of non-zero\ncharacteristic which are not supersolvable (see for instance [12, p.53] or [1]). Nevertheless, if the\nground field F is algebraically closed then every strongly-solvable Lie algebra is supersolvable\n(see [1, Lemma 2.4]).\nA subalgebra S of L is said to be triangulable on L if adLS = {adLx | x \u2208 S} is a Lie algebra of\nlinear transformations of L which is triangulable over the algebraic closure of F (equivalently,\nif every element of S2 acts nilpotently on L, see [23]). Some questions regarding triangulabilty\nof linear Lie algebras have been considered in [11].\nThe symbol +\u02d9 will denote a vector space direct sum. We say that L is almost abelian if L =\nL2+\u02d9Fx with adx acting as the identity map on the abelian ideal L2; L is quasi-abelian if it is\nabelian or almost abelian. Quasi-abelian Lie algebras are precisely those in which every subspace\nis a subalgebra.\n2 Preliminary Results\nThe Frattini subalgebra of L, denoted by F (L), is the intersection of all maximal subalgebras\nof L. It is known that F (L) need not be an ideal of L, even for algebraically closed fields (see\n[18]); the Frattini ideal of L, denoted by \u03c6(L), is the largest ideal of L contained in F (L). We\nsay that L is \u03c6 - free if \u03c6(L) = 0. Clearly, L\/\u03c6(L) is \u03c6-free.\nThe following is straightforward.\n2\nLemma 2.1 A Lie algebra L is two-generated if and only if L\/\u03c6(L) is two-generated.\nA class C of Lie algebras is said to be saturated if L \u2208 C whenever L\/\u03c6(L) \u2208 C. It is well-\nknown that the classes of solvable, strongly-solvable, supersolvable and nilpotent Lie algebras\nare saturated (see [1] and [15])\nFor short, we will say that the property P satisfies condition (*) if for every Lie algebra L all\nof whose two-generated proper subalgebras of L possess the property P, either L itself possesses\nthe property P or L is two-generated. Next, we collect some known results on classes of Lie\nalgebras which satisfy this condition.\nTheorem 0\n1. The classes of abelian, nilpotent and quasi-abelian Lie algebras satisfy condition (*).\n2. The class of simple (including the one-dimensional) Lie algebras satisfies condition (*). If\nchar(F ) 6= 2, 3 and every two-generated proper subalgebra of L is either simple or one-\ndimensional, then every subalgebra of L of dimension > 1 is simple and L is two-generated.\n3. If F is infinite and char(F ) > 5, then the class of solvable Lie algebras satisfies condition\n(*)\nProof. (1): Clearly, the class of abelian Lie algebras satisfies condition (*). Now, suppose\nthat every two-generated subalgebra of L is nilpotent. Let x \u2208 L and choose any y \u2208 L. Then\n< x, y > is nilpotent, so y(adx)n = 0 for some n. Hence y(adx)d = 0, where d = dim L. This\nholds for all y \u2208 L, so adx is nilpotent for all x \u2208 L. It follows from Engel\u2019s Theorem that L is\nnilpotent. To prove the last assertion in (1), suppose that every two-generated subalgebra of L\nis quasi-abelian. Then every two-dimensional subspace of L is a subalgebra of L, from which it\nfollows that every subspace of L is a subalgebra of L, and hence that L is quasi-abelian.\n(2): This is proved in [17, Proposition 3.2] and [20, Theorem 4].\n(3): It is an immediate consequence of a result of Grunewald, Kunyavskii, Nikolova and Plotkin\nin [10].\nThe structure of solvable minimal non-abelian Lie algebras has been fully described by Stitzinger\nin [13, Theorem 1]. If L is such a Lie algebra, then L = A+\u02d9Fx, where A is an abelian ideal\nof L and adx acts irreducibly on A. Non-solvable minimal non-abelian Lie algebras have been\nstudied by Farnsteiner in [5] and Gein in [6] (see also Elduque [3]).\nWe finish this section by collecting some known results on the structure of a minimal non-C Lie\nalgebra for several classes C.\nMinimal non-quasi-abelian Lie algebras over a field of characteristic different from 2 and 3 have\nbeen studied by Gein in [7, Proposition 3] and Varea in [19, Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.4]. If\n3\nL is such a Lie algebra, then one of the following occurs: (a) L is solvable minimal non-abelian;\n(b) L \u223c= sl(2); (c) L is simple minimal non-abelian; or (d) L has a basis a1, a2, x with product\ngiven by one of the following rules:\n1. [a1, a2] = 0, [a1, x] = a1, [a2, x] = \u03b1a2, 1 6= \u03b1 \u2208 F\n2. [a1, a2] = 0, [a1, x] = a1, [a2, x] = a1 + a2.\nMinimal non-solvable Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic have\nbeen studied by Varea in [21]\nMinimal non-nilpotent Lie algebras have been studied by Stitzinger in [13], Gein and Kuznecov\n[9], Towers [16] and Farnsteiner [5]. In Gein [8], it is proved that if L is simple and minimal\nnon-nilpotent then the intersection of two distinct maximal subalgebras of L is zero and L has no\nnon-zero ad-nilpotent elements. For the readers\u2019 convenience we include here a proof of Gein\u2019s\nresult. (Our proof is different from the one given in [8].)\nTheorem 2.2 (Gein [8]) Let L be a simple Lie algebra over an arbitrary field F . Assume that\nevery proper subalgebra is nilpotent. Then the following hold:\n1. M1 \u2229M2 = 0 for every pair of different maximal subalgebras M1 and M2 of L;\n2. L has no non-zero ad-nilpotent elements; and\n3. L is two-generated.\nProof. (1): Let M be a maximal subalgebra of L. Assume that there exists a proper subalgebra\nS of L not contained in M such that M \u2229 S 6= 0. Choose S such that dimM \u2229 S is maximal.\nNilpotency of M implies that NM (M \u2229S) 6=M \u2229S. Nilpotency of S implies that NS(M \u2229S) 6=\nM \u2229 S. Let T be the subalgebra of L generated by NM (M \u2229 S) and NS(M \u2229 S). Since M \u2229 S\nis a non-zero ideal of T , it follows from the simplicity of L that T 6= L. Moreover we have\nS \u2229M < T \u2229M , which contradicts our choice of S.\n(2): Let 0 6= x \u2208 L be ad-nilpotent. Let H be a maximal subalgebra of L containing x. Let\nL = L0+\u02d9L1 be the Fitting decomposition of L relative to H. Since H is a maximal subalgebra of\nL, we have H = L0. Since x acts nilpotently on L1, there exists 0 6= y \u2208 L1 such that [x, y] = 0.\nTherefore CL(x) is not contained in H. Take a maximal subalgebra M of L containing CL(x).\nWe find that H \u2229M 6= 0 and H 6=M , which contradicts (1).\n(3): Assume L 6=< x, y > for every x, y \u2208 L. Let M be a maximal subalgebra of L. Take\n0 6= x \u2208 M and y \u2208 L, y 6\u2208 M . There exists a maximal subalgebra S of L containing < x, y >.\nWe have S \u2229M 6= 0, which contradicts (1).\nConjecture: Every simple minimal non-solvable Lie algebra is two-generated.\n4\nFrom [10] (see Theorem 0(3)) it follows that the conjecture is true for infinite fields of char-\nacteristic greater than 5. In section 4, we will prove that a Lie algebra L all of whose proper\nsubalgebras are triangulable on L is two-generated.\n3 The classes of strongly-solvable and supersolvable Lie algebras\nIn this section we consider the classes of strongly-solvable and supersolvable Lie algebras. We\nrecall that the Lie algebra with basis a, b, c and product given by [a, b] = c, [a, c] = [b, c] = 0 is\ncalled the three-dimensional Heisenberg algebra.\nThe structure of solvable \u03c6-free minimal non-strongly-solvable Lie algebras was determined in\n[2] and is given below.\nTheorem 3.1 Let L be a solvable \u03c6-free minimal non-strongly-solvable Lie algebra. Then F\nhas characteristic p > 0 and L = A+\u02d9B is a semidirect sum, where A is the unique minimal ideal\nof L, dim A \u2265 2, A2 = 0, and either B = M+\u02d9Fx, where M is an abelian minimal ideal of B\n(type I), or B is the three-dimensional Heisenberg algebra (type II).\nBy using Theorem 3.1 we prove the following.\nProposition 3.2 Let L be solvable \u03c6-free minimal non-strongly-solvable Lie algebra. Then L is\ntwo-generated.\nProof. The structure of L is described in Theorem 3.1 above.\nSuppose first that L is of type I. Clearly, [A,B] is an ideal of L. So that either [A,B] = A or\n[A,B] = 0. In the latter case, we have that B is also an ideal of L, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore [A,B] = A. On the other hand, we have that [x,M ] is an ideal of B contained in M .\nSo, either [x,M ] = M or [x,M ] = 0. In the latter case, we have that B is abelian. This yields\nthat L2 \u2264 A and hence L2 is abelian, a contradiction. Therefore [x,M ] = M . Then we have\nthat B2 = M and L2 = A + B2 = A +M . If A(adm)2 = 0 for all m \u2208 M it is easy to see\nthat (adn)3 = 0 for all n \u2208 L2. But then L2 is nil and hence nilpotent, by Engel\u2019s theorem, a\ncontradiction. Choosem \u2208M such that A(adm)2 6= 0, and then a \u2208 A such that [[a,m],m] 6= 0.\nNow B =< m,x >. Put D =< a + x,m >. Then [[a + x,m],m] = [[a,m],m] \u2208 D, whence\nD \u2229 A 6= 0. Clearly L = A + D so D \u2229 A is an ideal of L. It follows that A \u2286 D, giving\nD = A+ < x,m >= L and L is two-generated.\nSo suppose that L is of type II. Then B has a basis c, s, x with product given by [s, x] = c,\n[c, x] = [c, s] = 0. Put C = CA(c). Then C is an ideal of L and so C = A or C = 0. The former\nimplies that L2 = A + Fc is abelian, a contradiction, so C = 0. Let D =< a + s, x >. Then\n[a, x] + c \u2208 D. If [a, x] = 0, then c \u2208 D. But this implies that 0 6= [a, c] \u2208 D \u2229A, whence L = D\n5\nas above. So suppose that [a, x] 6= 0. This yields that [[a, x], x] \u2208 D, from which [[a, x], x] 6= 0\nwould give L = D again. So we have that [a, x] 6= 0 but [[a, x], x] = 0. Put E =< [a, x] + s, x >.\nThen c = [[a, x] + s, x] \u2208 E, whence [[a, x], c] \u2208 E. But [[a, x], c] 6= 0 since [a, x] 6= 0, giving\nE \u2229A 6= 0 from which L = E. The proof is complete.\nNow we are able to prove the following result.\nTheorem 3.3 Let L be a Lie algebra such that every two-generated proper subalgebra is strongly\nsolvable.\n1. Assume that L is solvable but not strongly solvable. Then every proper subalgebra of L is\nstrongly solvable and L is two-generated.\n2. Assume that L is non-solvable, F is infinite and char(F ) > 5. Then L is two-generated,\nevery proper subalgebra of L is strongly solvable and L\/\u03c6(L) is simple.\nProof. (1): Let S be a non-strongly-solvable subalgebra of L of minimal dimension. Clearly,\nS is minimal non-strongly-solvable. We have that S\/\u03c6(S) is \u03c6-free, solvable and minimal non-\nstrongly-solvable. By Proposition 3.2 it follows that S\/\u03c6(S) is two-generated, whence S is also\ntwo-generated, by Lemma 2.1. By our hypothesis it follows that S = L. This yields that L is\nminimal non-strongly-solvable and two-generated. The proof of (1) is complete.\n(2): By using Theorem 0(3) we obtain that every non-solvable subalgebra of L (including L\nitself) is two-generated. From this and our hypothesis it follows that every proper subalgebra of\nL is solvable. Now let S be a proper subalgebra of L. Assume that S is not strongly solvable.\nThen, by (1) it follows that S is two-generated. But then, by our hypothesis S is strongly\nsolvable, a contradiction. Put L\u00af = L\/\u03c6(L). We have that L\u00af is non-solvable but every proper\nsubalgebra of L\u00af is solvable. On the other hand, since L\u00af is \u03c6-free we have that L\u00af = N + S,\nN \u2229 S = 0, where N is the largest nilpotent ideal of L\u00af and S is a non-solvable subalgebra of L\u00af.\nThis yields that S = L\u00af and hence N = 0. Let A be a minimal ideal of L\u00af. We have that either\nA2 = A or A2 = 0. In the latter case, we have A \u2264 N = 0, a contradiction. This yields that\nA = A2 and hence A = L\u00af. Therefore L\u00af is simple. This completes the proof.\nNext we consider the class of supersolvable Lie algebras\nThe structure of strongly-solvable minimal non-supersolvable Lie algebras as well as that of \u03c6-\nfree, non-strongly-solvable and minimal non-supersolvable Lie algebras were determined in [4].\nFor the readers\u2019 convenience, we give them below\nTheorem 3.4 [4, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2] Let L be minimal non-supersolvable.\n1. If L is strongly solvable, then L = \u03c6(L)+\u02d9A+\u02d9Fx, where A is subspace of L, A2 \u2264 \u03c6(L),\nwith adx acting irreducibly on A and adx |\u03c6(L) is split.\n6\n2. If L is \u03c6-free and non-strongly-solvable, then char(F ) = p > 0 and one of the following\nhold:\n(a) L = ((x, y, e0, e1, . . . , ep\u22121)) with [ei, y] = (\u03b1 + i)ei where \u03b1 is a fixed scalar in F ,\n[ei, x] = ei+1 (indices mod.p), [x, y] = x, [ei, ej ] = 0 and F = {tp \u2212 t | t \u2208 F}.\n(b) L = ((x, y, z, e0, e1, . . . , ep\u22121)) with [ei, z] = ei for every i and [ei, x] = ei+1 (i =\n0, . . . , p\u2212 2) (non-specified products are zero) and F is perfect whenever p = 2.\nNow we can prove the following\nTheorem 3.5 Let L be a solvable Lie algebra.\n1. If L minimal non-supersolvable, then L is two-generated.\n2. If every two-generated proper subalgebra of L is supersolvable but L is not supersolvable,\nthen every proper subalgebra of L is supersolvable. So, either L has the structure given in\n(1) of Theorem 3.4 or L\/\u03c6(L) is isomorphic to one of the Lie algebras described in (2) of\nTheorem 3.4.\nProof. (1): If L2 is not nilpotent, then L is minimal non-strongly-solvable. So, by Theorem 3.3\nit follows that L is two-generated. Now assume that L2 is nilpotent. Put L\u00af = L\/\u03c6(L). We\nhave that L\u00af is \u03c6-free, strongly solvable and minimal non-supersolvable. By Theorem 3.4, we\nhave that L\u00af = A+\u02d9Fx where A is a nonzero abelian ideal of L\u00af and adx acts irreducibly on A.\nPick 0 6= a \u2208 A. We have that L\u00af is generated by a and x. From Lemma 2.1 it follows that L is\ntwo-generated. The proof of (1) is complete.\n(2): Clearly, L has a subalgebra S which is minimal non-supersolvable. From (1) it follows that\nS is two-generated. Then, by our hypothesis, we have that S = L.\n4 The property of triangulability\nA subalgebra S of L is said to be triangulable on L if adLS = {adLx | x \u2208 S} is a Lie algebra of\nlinear transformations of L which is triangulable over the algebraic closure of F . A subalgebra\nS of L is said to be nil on L if adx is nilpotent for every x \u2208 S. It is well-known that for\nevery subalgebra S of L, there is a unique maximal ideal nil(S) of S consisting of ad-nilpotent\nelements of L (see [23, Proposition 2.1]). Also, it is known that S is triangulable on L if and\nonly if S\/nil(S) is abelian (see [23, Theorem 2.2]). Note that every subalgebra of L which is\ntriangulable on L is strongly solvable.\nFirst, we give the following easy lemma which will be used in the sequel.\n7\nLemma 4.1 Let L be a Lie algebra and S and T subalgebras of L which are nil on L. Assume\nthat [S, T ] \u2282 T . Then S + T is nil on L.\nProof. We see that the set adS \u222a adT is weakly closed in the sense of Jacobson [12]. Therefore,\nby [12, Theorem 1,p.33], every element of S + T acts nilpotently on L.\nProposition 4.2 Let S be a triangulable subalgebra of L. Then nil(S) is precisely the set of all\nelements of S which act nilpotently on L.\nProof. Let \u2126 be an algebraic closure of F and let L\u2126 = L\u2297F \u2126. Put A = adLS. We have that\nA \u2264 gl(L) and that A\u2126 is a subalgebra of gl(L\u2126) and a set of simultaneously triangulable linear\nmaps. Then it is obvious that the set N(A\u2126) of nilpotent elements of A\u2126 is closed under linear\ncombinations and that (A\u2126)2 < N(A\u2126). Since (A2)\u2126 = (A\u2126)2, it follows that A2 is contained in\nthe set N of nilpotent elements in A. Also, we have that N is closed under linear combinations.\nSo N is actually an ideal of A. Then nil(S) is contained in the inverse image N \u2032 of N under the\nadjoint representation adL. This is a Lie-homomorphism, whence N \u2032 is an ideal of S. It follows\nthat N \u2032 = nil(S). This completes the proof.\nLemma 4.3 Let L be a Lie algebra which is not two-generated. Then for each maximal sub-\nalgebra M of L and each non-zero element x in M there exists a maximal subalgebra S of L\ndifferent from M containing x. If the ground field F is infinite, then each element of L lies in\ninfinitely many maximal subalgebras of L.\nProof. Let M be a maximal subalgebra of L and 0 6= x \u2208 M . Pick y \u2208 L \\M . By hypothesis,\n< x, y >6= L. So, there exists a maximal subalgebra S of L containing < x, y >. We see that\nS 6= M since y \u2208 S and y 6\u2208 M . Now suppose that F is infinite. Let x \u2208 L and assume\nthat M1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Mr are the only maximal subalgebras of L which contain x. Since F is infinite,\nM1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222aMr 6= L. Pick y \u2208 L, y 6\u2208 M1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222aMr. Then, by hypothesis L 6=< x, y >. Take\na maximal subalgebra S of L containing < x, y >. We see that x \u2208 S and S 6= Mi for every i,\nwhich is a contradiction.\nNow we give some information on the structure of a simple Lie algebra all of whose proper\nsubalgebras are triangulable. Clearly, a simple minimal non-abelian Lie algebra satisfies this\ncondition. However, we do not know any other example.\nTheorem 4.4 Let L be a simple Lie algebra such that every proper subalgebra of L is triangu-\nlable on L. Then the following hold:\n1. if M is a maximal subalgebra of L, then either M is abelian and none of the non-zero\nelements of M acts nilpotently on L or nil(M) is a non-zero maximal nil subalgebra of L;\n8\n2. if K is a non-zero maximal nil subagebra of L, then the normalizer of K in L is a maximal\nsubalgebra of L;\n3. for each two different maximal subalgebrasM1 and M2 of L, none of the non-zero elements\nof M1 \u2229M2 acts nilpotently on L (in particular, M1 \u2229M2 is abelian); and\n4. L is two-generated.\nProof. (1): Let M be any maximal subalgebra of L. First assume that nil(M) = 0. Then\nwe have M2 \u2264 nil(M) = 0. So, M is abelian. By Proposition 4.2 it follows that M does not\ncontain any non-zero ad-nilpotent element of L. Now assume nil(M) 6= 0. Let K be a maximal\nnil subalgebra of L containing nil(M). Assume K 6= nil(M). By Proposition 4.2 again, we have\nM \u2229K = nil(M). Nilpotency of K implies that nil(M) is properly contained in the normalizer\nNK(nil(M)) of nil(M) in K. This yields that nil(M) is an ideal of L, since L =M+NK(nil(M))\nby maximality of M , a contradiction. Therefore K = nil(M) and so nil(M) is maximal nil on\nL. The proof of (1) is complete.\n(2): Let 0 6= K be a maximal nil subalgebra of L. LetM be a maximal subalgebra of L containing\nK. Then, by Proposition 4.2 it follows that K = nil(M). This yields that M = NL(K) and\nhence NL(K) is a maximal subalgebra.\n(3): Let M1,M2 be distinct maximal subalgebras of L. By Proposition 4.2 we have that\nnil(M1 \u2229M2) = nil(M1) \u2229 nil(M2)\nWe need to prove that nil(M1 \u2229M2) = 0. Assume that nil(M1 \u2229M2) 6= 0. Choose M1 and M2\nsuch that the dimension of nil(M1 \u2229M2) is maximal. Suppose that nil(M1 \u2229M2) = nil(M2).\nThen we have 0 6= nil(M2) \u2264 nil(M1). By (1) it follows that nil(M2) = nil(M1). This yields\nthat nil(M2) is an ideal of M1 and M2 and therefore it is an ideal of L. Simplicity of L implies\nthat nil(M2) = 0, a contradiction. Hence nil(M1 \u2229 M2) 6= nil(M2). Analogously, we have\nnil(M1 \u2229M2) 6= nil(M1). Now, by using Engel\u2019s Theorem we obtain subalgebras S1 and S2 of L\nstrictly containing nil(M1 \u2229M2) and such that\nnil(M1 \u2229M2)\u00a2 Si \u2264 nil(Mi) for i = 1, 2\nLet S be the subalgebra of L generated by S1 and S2. We find that nil(M1 \u2229M2) is an ideal of\nS. Simplicity of L implies that S 6= L. Take a maximal subalgebra M3 of L containing S. We\nhave\nnil(M1 \u2229M2) \u2282 S1 \u2286M3 \u2229 nil(M1) = nil(M1 \u2229M3)\nwhich contradicts the maximality of nil(M1 \u2229M2). This completes the proof of (3).\n(4): Assume that L 6=< a, b > for every a, b \u2208 L. Let K be a nil subalgebra of L of maximal\ndimension. If K = 0, then by (1) we have that every maximal subalgebra of L is abelian. Let\nM1,M2 be distinct maximal subalgebras of L. We have that M1 \u2229M2 = 0; since, otherwise, we\nwould have that M1 \u2229M2 is a nonzero ideal of L, which is a contradiction. Pick 0 6= a1 \u2208 M1\nand 0 6= a2 \u2208 M2. Since < a1, a2 >6= L, we can take a maximal subalgebra M3 of L containing\n9\na1 and a2. But then we have 0 6= a1 \u2208 M1 \u2229M3 and M1 6= M3, a contradiction. Therefore\nK 6= 0. Pick x \u2208 K, x 6= 0. By (3), there exists only one maximal subalgebra of L containing x,\nwhich contradicts Lemma 4.3. Therefore L can be generated by two elements. The proof of the\ntheorem is complete.\nNow we can prove the following\nLemma 4.5 1. If \u03c6(L) \u2264 S \u2264 L, then nil(S\/\u03c6(L)) = nil(S)\/\u03c6(L).\n2. If every two-generated proper subalgebra of L is triangulable on L, then the same holds in\nL\/\u03c6(L).\nProof. (1): Assume \u03c6(L) \u2264 S \u2264 L. Let nil(S\/\u03c6(L)) = K\/\u03c6(L). Since \u03c6(L) is a nilpotent ideal\nof L (see [15]), it is nil on L. So, \u03c6(L) \u2264 nil(S). Clearly, nil(S) \u2264 K. Now let x \u2208 K. We have\nthat x acts nilpotently on L\/\u03c6(L). This yields that L = \u03c6(L)+L0(x), where L0(x) is the Fitting\nnull-component of L relative to adx. As L0(x) is a subalgebra of L, it follows that L = L0(x).\nSo that x acts nilpotently on L. This yields that K \u2264 nil(S).\n(2): Assume that every two-generated proper subalgebra of L is triangulable on L. Let S\/\u03c6(L)\nbe a two-generated proper subalgebra of L\/\u03c6(L). Take elements a, b \u2208 L such that S\/\u03c6(L) =<\na + \u03c6(L), b + \u03c6(L) >. We have that S =< a, b > +\u03c6(L) and that < a, b > is triangulable on\nL. On the other hand, from Lemma 4.1 it follows that \u03c6(L) + nil(< a, b >) is nil on L. Since\n\u03c6(L) + nil(< a, b >) is an ideal of S, we have that \u03c6(L) + nil(< a, b >) \u2264 nil(S). Then,\nS2 \u2264 \u03c6(L)+ < a, b >2\u2264 \u03c6(L) + nil(< a, b >) \u2264 nil(S)\nSo, we have that\n(S\/\u03c6(L))2 = S2 + \u03c6(L)\/\u03c6(L) \u2264 nil(S)\/\u03c6(L) = nil(S\/\u03c6(L))\nby (1). Therefore S\/\u03c6(L) is triangulable on L\/\u03c6(L). The proof is complete.\nTheorem 4.6 1. If L is solvable and every two-generated proper subalgebra of L is triangu-\nlable on L, then L is triangulable.\n2. If every proper subalgebra of L is triangulable on L but L itself is not, then L is two-\ngenerated and L\/\u03c6(L) is simple (so, L\/\u03c6(L) satisfies (1)-(4) in Theorem 4.4).\nProof. (1): Let L be solvable and every two-generated proper subalgebra of L be triangulable on\nL. In particular, we have that every two-generated proper subalgebra of L is strongly solvable.\nPut L\u00af = L\/\u03c6(L). Then, by Theorem 3.3(1) it follows that every proper subalgebra of L\u00af is\nstrongly solvable. Moreover, by Lemma 4.5 we have that every two-generated proper subalgebra\nof L\u00af is triangulable on L\u00af. Now suppose that L is not triangulable. So that L is not strongly\nsolvable. Thus, L\u00af is not strongly solvable either. By using Theorem 3.1 we obtain that L\u00af = A+B,\n10\nwhere A is the unique minimal ideal of L\u00af, A2 = 0, B < L\u00af, A \u2229 B = 0, and either B = M+\u02d9Fx,\nwhere M is the unique minimal ideal of B or B is the three-dimensional Heisenberg algebra.\nWe have that L\u00af2 = A + B2. On the other hand, we see that B is two-generated. So, B is\ntriangulable on L\u00af. This yields that B2 acts nilpotently on A and therefore L\u00af2 is nilpotent. So\nthat L\u00af is strongly solvable. This contradiction completes the proof of (1).\n(2): Assume that every proper subalgebra of L is triangulable on L but L itself is not. By (1) we\nhave that L is not solvable. By Lemmas 4.5(1), 2.1 and since the class of solvable Lie algebras\nis saturated, we may suppose without loss of generality that L is \u03c6-free. By Towers [15] we have\nthat L = N +S and N \u2229S = 0, where N is the largest nilpotent ideal of L and S is a subalgebra\nof L. If S 6= L, then we have that S is solvable. So, L is solvable, a contradiction. It follows that\nN = 0 and so L is simple. Hence, L satisfies (1)-(4) in Theorem 4.4. The proof is complete.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors are grateful to the referee for his\/her useful comments; in particular, for providing\na shorter and clearer proof of Proposition 4.2.\nReferences\n[1] D.W.
