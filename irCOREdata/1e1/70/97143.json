Introduction\nThe staggering variety in biological form is remarkable given the relatively small number of\nunderlying mechanisms by which biological self-organization and morphogenesis proceed.\nIn particular, the fundamentals governing how individual cell interactions create phenotypic\n0951-7715\/08\/110251+40$30.00 \u00a9 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd and London Mathematical Society Printed in the UK R251\nR252 Invited Article\nstructure are typically rooted in a relatively small number of similar principles, usually\nutilizing analogous, often homologous, proteins and evolutionary, conserved pathways [1].\nIt is differences in the temporal and spatial regulation of these mechanisms that typically\nresult in the complexity that we see [1]. Consequently, our understanding of biological self-\norganization is often amenable to, and enhanced by, mathematical and computational modelling\naddressing the emergence and regulation of temporal and spatial complexity from fundamental\nmechanisms operating ultimately at a cellular level.\nGiven the importance of both spatial and temporal variation, partial differential equations\n(PDEs) are often, but certainly not always, a sensible mathematical framework for investigating\nlarge-scale structure formation. We will outline representative examples of such modelling\ninvestigations before reviewing how modern biological developments are revealing limitations\nin current modelling frameworks and highlighting exciting opportunities for novel theoretical\nstudies.\n1.1. Examples of self-organization in cellular and developmental biology\nDevelopmental biology is replete with examples of self-organization. While the fertilized\negg does exhibit polarity, it is a single cell from which numerous cell types, and structure,\nultimately emerge. Questions immediately arise as to how do individual but genetically\nidentical cells \u2018know\u2019 when and where to create or respond to signals, express genes, synthesize\nproteins, differentiate, migrate or divide. The principle mechanism for this is differential gene\nexpression, whereby both long- and short-range signals are utilized to enforce tight spatial and\ntemporal control over gene expression, thus robustly ensuring the pattern of differentiated cell\ntypes necessary for embryological development.\nNumerous aspects of such dynamics have been considered from a theoretical perspective\nto systematically interrogate putative self-organization mechanisms, assist our insights and\nextract predictions of, or empirical tests for, their consequences. An illustrative selection of\nexamples includes the following:\n(a) mechanisms for axis formation, for example, left\u2013right polarity initiation in the mouse\n[2\u20134];\n(b) heterogeneous cell fate decisions, including the roles of Nodal and Lefty gene products\nin left\u2013right polarity signal amplification [2, 5], cell fates in the zebrafish mesoderm [6],\nthe induction of neural tissue in the frog [1], patterning in the Drosophila wing [7] and\nhair follicle formation [8];\n(c) controlled cell migrations, illustrated by gastrulation, lung morphogenesis and nervous\nsystem development [9\u201311];\n(d) skeletal morphogenesis, for example the formation of somites [12, 13] and limbs [14\u201317];\n(e) the formation of skin patterns, typified by mammalian coat markings [18\u201320] and feather\nbud arrangements [21, 22];\n(f) fine-grained patterning, illustrated by lateral inhibition within delta-notch signalling [23];\n(g) adhesion-driven cell sorting [24, 25].\nFigure 1 illustrates four examples of self-organization in developmental biology, including\ncoat markings, limb\/digit, somite and feather bud formation. Cellular biological pattern\nformation is far from restricted to developmental biology, however. The formation and\nchanges in the markings of fish, such as the Angelfish Pomacanthus [26] or the Foxn1-mutant\nmouse [27], are representative examples in which higher levels of marking structure evolve\nlater than the developmental stage. In addition, there are numerous examples where the\nstructure emerges because of interactions between individual organisms rather than within an\nInvited Article R253\nFigure 1.

Common examples at the cellular level include self-organization due\nto the combination of motility and signalling within swarming bacteria [28, 29] and social\namoebae such as Dictyostelium discoideum [30].\n1.2. A framework for PDE modelling of self-organization\nThe most common principle for modelling self-organization in developmental biology using\nPDEs is the law of conservation [31]. With \u2202\u0003a an arbitrary surface enclosing a time-\nindependent volume \u0003a , then the rate of change in the amount of material inside \u0003a must\nequal the net flux of material across the surface \u2202\u0003a plus the net production of material in \u0003a .\nThus\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u222b\n\u0003a\nu(x, t) dV = \u2212\n\u222b\n\u2202\u0003a\nJ \u00b7 ds +\n\u222b\n\u0003a\nf (u, x, t) dV, (1)\nwhere u(x, t) represents the amount of material at x at time t , J the flux of material and f the\nnet rate of production of u. Application of the divergence theorem yields\u222b\n\u0003a\n{\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+ \u2207 \u00b7 J \u2212 f (u, x, t)\n}\ndV = 0. (2)\nSince the volume \u0003a is arbitrary, the integrand must be identically equal to zero and hence\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 J + f (u, x, t). (3)\nThe system is closed by specifying suitable initial and boundary conditions and the result can\nbe generalized in an obvious manner to include multiple, interacting species.\n1.2.1. Derivation of the flux. The material flux can arise from many sources and its\nspecification becomes the next problem to be faced. Most simple is advection of the material\nwith velocity v; this results in a flux of the form J = vu. Diffusion is an alternative, common,\ntransport mechanism; most frequently employed is the Fickian formulation, J = \u2212D\u2207u,\nwhich yields\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= D\u22072u + f (u, x, t), (4)\nso that the material moves down gradients of its own density. However, such a formulation tends\nto imply that diffusion is a short-range effect: this can be seen by considering the Laplacian\noperator in the absence of material production [31]:\n\u22072u \u221d lim\nR\u21920\n\u3008u(x, t)\u3009 \u2212 u(x, t)\nR2\n, (5)\nwhere \u3008u(x, t)\u3009 is the average density of material in a sphere of radius R centred about the\npoint x,\n\u3008u(x, t)\u3009 = 3\n4\u03c0R3\n\u222b\nsphere\nu(x + r, t) dr. (6)\nExpansion of the integrand about x for small r gives\n\u3008u(x, t)\u3009 = 3\n4\u03c0R3\n\u222b\nsphere\n[\nu(x, t) + (r.\u2207)u(x, t) + 1\n2\n(r.\u2207)2u(x, t) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n]\ndr,\n= u(x, t) + 1\n10\nR2\u22072u(x, t) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (7)\nsince the second term in the integrand evaluates to zero. This is of the form of equation (5)\nwith constant of proportionality 1\/10.\nOther forms for the flux are discussed in more detail in section 2.2\u2014in general they assume\nphenomenological forms which are based on qualitative observations.\nInvited Article R255\n1.2.2. Integro-differential formulation. Another common framework is an integral\nformulation, so that the rate of change in material density at x is dependent on the density\nat neighbouring positions x + r. This leads to an integro-differential equation of the form\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= f (u, x, t) +\n\u222b\nR3\nw(r)u(x + r, t) dr, (8)\nwhere w is a kernel which quantifies the effect of material in the environment upon u(x, t).\nAny constraints placed on w are dependent on the biological system under consideration.\nTypically one might assume thatw is homogeneous and isotropic and that the influence becomes\nnegligible as the distance from x becomes large [32]:\nw \u2192 0 as |r| \u2192 \u221e, w = w(|r|). (9)\nSuch formulations have been used to model, for example, the effects of cell adhesion and cell\nsorting according to different cell\u2013cell adhesion strengths [24, 33].\nA Taylor expansion of the density function contained in the integrand, on use of the\nisotropy of w, gives rise to\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= f (u, x, t) +\n\u222b\nR3\nw(r)\n[\nu(x, t) + (r.\u2207)u(x, t) + 1\n2\n(r.\u2207)2u(x, t) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n]\ndr,\n= f (u, x, t) + w0u + w2\u2207 \u00b7 (\u2207u) + w4\u2207 \u00b7 \u2207(\u22072u) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (10)\nwhere, assuming convergence,\nw2j = 1\n(2j)!\n\u222b\nR3\nr2jw(r) dr. (11)\nDepending on the form of w, it may be expedient to truncate the expansion after a finite number\nof terms, yielding a higher order PDE. For example, it is immediately obvious that truncation\nof the approximation after the 4th order contribution results in an equation of the form\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= f (u, x, t) + \u2207 \u00b7 [D1\u2207u \u2212 D2\u2207(\u22072u)]. (12)\nThis type of formulation is often used by modellers to describe the ability of cells to sense\nnon-locally due to their finite size\u2014see, for example, [34].\n1.2.3. Alternative derivations. There are, of course, several other methods of deriving PDE\ndescriptions of movement\u2014we briefly outline a couple in this section.\nVelocity jump processes, in 1D for example, consider the density of left- and right-\nmoving particles which reverse their direction of motion at random instants of time at rate\n\u03bb, say. Denoting the probability densities of left- and right-moving individuals by p\u2212 and p+,\nrespectively, and particle speed by s > 0 gives [35]\n\u2202p\u2212\n\u2202t\n\u2212 s \u2202p\u2212\n\u2202x\n= \u03bb(p+ \u2212 p\u2212), (13)\n\u2202p+\n\u2202t\n+ s\n\u2202p+\n\u2202x\n= \u03bb(p\u2212 \u2212 p+). (14)\nLetting p = p\u2212 + p+ gives the Telegraph equation [36]\n\u22022p\n\u2202t2\n+ 2\u03bb\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= s2 \u2202\n2p\n\u2202x2\n, (15)\nwhich in the limit \u03bb \u2192 \u221e and lim\u03bb\u2192\u221e s2\/2\u03bb\u2192D (constant) results in the classical diffusion\nequation, excluding behaviour at the extremes of the wavefront where the singular asymptotic\nlimit, switching between hyperbolic and parabolic behaviour, becomes important.\nR256 Invited Article\nOn the other hand, space jump processes suppose particles change their position at random\ninstants of time. Considering jumps of length h, space can be denoted by a set of grid points,\nxi , of separation h, such that Pi(t), the probability of finding an individual at xi at time t ,\nevolves according to the equation [37]\n\u2202Pi\n\u2202t\n= d [Pi\u22121(t) \u2212 2Pi(t) + Pi+1(t)] , (16)\nwhere d is the (constant) transition rate per unit time. Letting the step size, h, tend to zero,\nexpanding the terms Pi\u00b11 about xi and assuming that limh\u21920 dh2 = D gives once again the\ndiffusion equation.\nThese formulations, and others, have been derived in considerably more generality than\nwe can feasibly survey here and we refer interested readers to the literature [35, 37\u201339].\n1.3. The suitability of PDEs for modelling biological self-organization\nAs motivated above, classical modelling studies in biological self-organization have often\nfocused on differential equations. For simple systems, exact analytical solutions may be\npossible. Where they are not, separation of space and time scales or the exploitation of\nsome other small parameter enables the use of multiscale asymptotic approaches which give\nexcellent insight into system behaviour under different parameter regimes. As the number of\nmodel components becomes too unwieldy or the interactions too complex for such approaches,\nincreasingly sophisticated computational methods allow accurate numerical approximations\nto be calculated over a wide range of parameter space.\nNonetheless, one should be aware of the limitations of this type of modelling. The flux\nand\/or production terms in the conservation formulation are often phenomenological, without\nderivation from universal or fundamental principles. In addition, as the material density\nbecomes low stochastic effects can become significant. Finally, tortuous cellular level geometry\ncomplicates the investigation of spatial fluctuations at the cellular scale and the possibility of\nlarge variations among neighbouring cells prevents straightforward use of a continuum limit.\nHowever, with careful consideration of these pitfalls and awareness of when and where\ntechniques can successfully be applied, PDEs remain one of the most useful and insightful\ntools for modelling self-organization in developmental biology.\n1.4. Wider context\nAlthough this review will focus on self-organization in biology, it is important to note that the\ngeneral phenomenon of pattern formation has motivated an enormous amount of mathematical\nmodelling and analysis, most of which is beyond the scope of this review. However, we\nrefer interested readers to the seminal paper of Cross and Hohenberg [40], which reviews\ntheoretical approaches to spatial pattern formation in hydrodynamics, solidification fronts,\nnonlinear optics and chemical reactions, in addition to biological phenomena, and the books\nby Britton [41], Fife [42], Grindrod [43] and Hoyle [44]. These references carry out detailed\nanalytic bifurcation studies of coupled systems of PDEs using a wide range of mathematical\napproaches to address issues such as pattern selection, marginal stability, effects of boundaries\nand geometry, as well as investigating oscillatory behaviour, propagation of pulses and fronts,\nexternal forcing, effects of external noise, chaos and turbulence.\nInvited Article R257\n2. An overview of the PDE models of self-organization\nIt is possible to classify the archetypal PDE models for self-organization in development into\ntwo broad categories. In the first, chemicals (termed morphogens) specify a pre-pattern for\nfuture differentiation without interaction from the cells themselves. In the second, patterning\noccurs with feedback from the cells on any chemical or physical constituents that may be\nplaying a role in the organization of the system; these are generally referred to as taxis models.\nBoth can be derived from conservation equations taking the form\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n= \u2212 \u2207 \u00b7 Jn + fn(n, u, x, t), (17)\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u2212 \u2207 \u00b7 Ju + fu(n, u, x, t), (18)\nwhere u represents the material concentration of biochemical species and n the density of\ndifferent cell types. Jn\/u and fn\/u are as before but, importantly, they now also describe the\ninteractions between the model species.\nIn order to distinguish between pre-pattern and taxis models, we non-dimensionalize in\nthe following manner:\n\u2202n\u02dc\n\u2202t\u02dc\n= \u2212 \u2207 \u00b7 J\u02dcn + f\u02dcn(n\u02dc, u\u02dc, x\u02dc, t\u02dc), (19)\n\u03b7\n\u2202u\u02dc\n\u2202t\u02dc\n= \u2212 \u2207 \u00b7 J\u02dcu + f\u02dcu(n\u02dc, u\u02dc, x\u02dc, t\u02dc), (20)\nwhere the tildes denote non-dimensional variables and \u03b7 is the ratio of time scales of\nbiochemical changes to the cellular response (to biochemical signals). A number of possible\ncases arise, two of which are most interesting from the point of view of discussions here.\nFirstly, in the case that Ju and fu are independent of n, the chemical dynamics decouple from\nthe system and cellular dynamics are slave to the chemical pattern. Further, when \u03b7 \u0007 1, so\nthat the cellular response occurs significantly more slowly than the time scale of biochemical\nchanges, the biochemical species are at a steady state to leading order in \u03b7, at least once any\ninitial transients have dissipated. Consequently, we have a pre-pattern that directs future cell\ndifferentiation.\nIn the rest of this section we give an overview of the paradigm models for self-organization,\noutlining in each case examples of their use in modelling developmental systems.\n2.1. Morphogen models\nA morphogen refers to a diffusible signalling molecule, typically within a developmental\nsetting, that exerts a graded effect. In particular, cells exhibit a differential response to\nthe morphogen concentration [1, 45] or possibly the history of morphogen concentration\n[46, 47]. A standard example is the response of cells surrounding a source of morphogen,\nwhereby the gradient in morphogen concentration induces a spatially heterogeneous cellular\nresponse. Textbook examples of this include the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein in chick limb\ndevelopment [48\u201350] and the signalling protein Decapentaplegic (Dpp) in Drosophila wing\nimaginal disc development [51, 52]. Often, the long-range action of a morphogen is curtailed by\nthe effects of an antagonist, or inhibitor, and it is the interplay of these proteins that determines\nthe ultimate response; examples include the induction of neural tissue in the frog [1] and\nspecification of the somites [53, 54]. Generally this conceptual framework is standard in\ndevelopment [1, 45]. A modelling framework for such systems via reaction\u2013diffusion PDEs is\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u2207 \u00b7 (D\u2207u) + f(u, x, t), (21)\nR258 Invited Article\non a bounded domain, usually with Neumann, Dirichlet or Robin boundary conditions. Sources\nand sinks of morphogens can be incorporated via Neumann conditions and\/or included in the\nfunction f. In complete generality one may consider such equations on numerous neighbouring\ndomains or with a spatially varying diffusion matrix, D. An example of such a model considers\nthe robustness of patterning due to the gradient of the signalling molecule BMP in the dorsal\nregion of the Drosophila embryo where the domain is split into three regions (the neural\nectoderm, the mesoderm and the dorsal region) [55].\n2.1.1. Turing models. An important special case of the morphogen model, ubiquitous in\ntheoretical studies, is the eponymous Turing model first considered in the 1950s [56]. This\nimposes additional constraints on D and f in equation (21) and precludes the possibility of\nspatially inhomogeneous transport or reaction coefficients. In particular, in the absence of\ndiffusion, and thus spatial heterogeneity, the model exhibits a stable homogeneous steady\nstate. This steady state is however also required to be unstable in the presence of diffusion.\nThe fact that stability is lost on introducing spatial heterogeneity via a diffusive transport\nprocess is initially counter-intuitive in that diffusion, in the absence of reaction kinetics, acts to\ndrive a system to its homogeneous steady state, rather than destabilize it. General, necessary\nand sufficient, conditions for a Turing instability for equations (21) on an n-dimensional spatial\ndomain are presented in the literature [57] and two component analysis can be found in most\ntextbooks (see below and, e.g. [32]).\nIn particular, for a system consisting of two morphogens one requires the concept of\n\u2018short-range activation, long-range inhibition\u2019 for a Turing model [58]. Thus one of the\nmorphogens, denoted the activator, has to catalyze its own production and be inhibited by\nthe second morphogen. In addition, the activator has to have a smaller diffusion coefficient\nand thus have a smaller range of influence. Without these biologically restrictive constraints,\na Turing instability cannot occur.\nFigure 2 shows the results of the numerical simulation of a Turing morphogen model using\nGierer\u2013Meinhardt kinetics [59] of the form\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u2207 \u00b7 (\u2207u) + u\n2\nv\n\u2212 bu, (22)\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= \u2207 \u00b7 (D\u2207v) + u2 \u2212 v, (23)\nwhere D and b are positive constants. Amplification of small fluctuations in the activator field\nleads to a regular array of peaks and troughs in both activator and inhibitor concentrations.\nAn important consequence of such a model is that for a sufficiently small domain,\nsignificantly smaller than the diffusive length scale, the homogeneous steady state will be\nstable. However, increasing the domain size results in the diffusively driven spatial variation\nbecoming non-negligible and thus a bifurcation to spatial heterogeneity. This provides a\nmechanism for the initiation of structure from fluctuations. As such, this subset of morphogen\nmodels is more fundamental than the general model. When examining the consequence of\ndistributions of BMP in models such as those presented by Eldar [55], one considers the\ndownstream effects of an implicit earlier heterogeneity (for example, the fact that the domain\nis already split into three regions). In contrast, Turing models are capable of representing the\ninitial symmetry breaking event and\/or amplifying the smallest of fluctuations into a large-scale\nspatial pattern.\nThis is a very important distinction. Morphogen-based pattern formation, whereby\nsignalling molecules\u2019 long-range influence induces a higher order of structure, is a common and\nvalidated paradigm in developmental biology [1, 45]. The Turing pattern formation mechanism\nInvited Article R259\nwithin a morphogen system, in contrast, is still to be definitively validated in developmental\nbiology. Potential candidates for Turing morphogens are Nodal and Lefty in the amplification\nof an initial signal of left\u2013right axis formation [2, 5] and zebrafish mesoderm cell fates [6],\nplus Wnt and Dkk in hair follicle formation [8] and TGF-\u03b2 as the activator, plus an unknown\ninhibitor, in limb bud morphogenesis [62].\nA difficulty with the Turing model concerns the ratio of activator to inhibitor diffusion\ncoefficients. Even models which consider a direct comparison with experiments take this\nratio to be much less than unity; for example, in [8] it is taken to be 0.025 without biological\nmotivation. However, it is unlikely that such small ratios exist in the absence of a large ratio of\nmolecular sizes for the Turing morphogens. Arguably unrealistic ratios of diffusion coefficients\nfor ATP and ADP have also been used in simple models illustrating that Turing patterns can\npotentially occur at the subcellular level for the glycolytic reaction [63]. In preparation for\nour discussion on future modelling opportunities, we will show that while Turing patterns\ncan occur in two variable systems with nearly equal diffusion rates, this requires an extreme\nfine-tuning of reaction rate constants.\nThe Turing instability for nearly equal diffusion coefficients. Consider a two component\nsystem u(x, t) = (u(x, t), v(x, t)) satisfying the reaction\u2013diffusion equations\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= D\u22072u + f(u), x \u2208 \u0003, t \u2208 [0,\u221e), (24)\nwhere D = diag(D1,D2) is a diffusion matrix, f(u) = (f (u, v), g(u, v)), \u0003 is a bounded\ndomain and the initial conditions are denoted by u(x, 0) = u0(x). For definiteness, we consider\nhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, that is\nn \u00b7 \u2207u = n \u00b7 \u2207v = 0, x \u2208 \u2202\u0003, (25)\nwhere n is the outward pointing normal on \u2202\u0003. We assume the kinetics are such that there\nis a unique, positive, homogeneous, linearly stable steady state, denoted u\u2217. Now consider a\nsmall perturbation about this steady state of the form\nu(x, t) = u\u2217 + \u0007Re[e\u03bbktukwk(x)], (26)\nwhere uk is a constant vector and the function wk(x) is not identically zero and satisfies the\neigenfunction equation\n\u22072wk = \u2212k2wk, (27)\non the domain \u0003, inheriting boundary conditions from the full problem. This fixes the allowed,\nconstant, values of k.\nNote that k must be real. Indeed, suppose \u22072w = \u00b5w, where \u00b5 and w are, in general,\ncomplex and \u00b5 is constant. Then a standard manipulation of equation (27) and its complex\nconjugate firstly yields\n(\u00b5\u2217 \u2212 \u00b5)\n\u222b\n\u0003\n|w|2 dV =\n\u222b\n\u0003\n[w\u22072w\u2217 \u2212 w\u2217\u22072w] dV = 0, (28)\nand thus the eigenvalue, \u00b5, must be real. Its negativity follows from\n0 =\n\u222b\n\u0003\n[\nw\u2217\u22072w \u2212 \u00b5w\u2217w] dV, (29)\nwhich implies\n\u00b5 = \u2212\n\u222b\n\u0003\n\u2207w \u00b7 \u2207w\u2217 dV\u222b\n\u0003\nw\u2217w dV\n= \u2212\n\u222b\n\u0003\n|\u2207w|2 dV\u222b\n\u0003\n|w|2 dV \u0001 0. (30)\nR260 Invited Article\nThus we can write \u00b5 = \u2212k2, with k real.\nWe proceed by substituting (26) into (24) and working to leading orders in \u0007, as befits a\nlinear stability analysis. This reveals that a non-trivial perturbation requires\ndet|\u03bbkI \u2212 J + k2D| = 0, (31)\nwhere\nJ =\n(\nfu fv\ngu gv\n)\n, (32)\nis the Jacobian matrix of the kinetics f evaluated at the steady state u\u2217. A Turing instability,\ni.e. a diffusively driven instability, requires both (i) Re(\u03bb0) < 0 and (ii) Re(\u03bbk) > 0 for some\nallowed value of k \n= 0. Condition (i) yields\nfugv \u2212 fvgu > 0, fu + gv < 0. (33)\nCondition (ii) additionally reveals that we require\nD1D2k\n4 \u2212 (D2fu + D1gv)k2 + (fugv \u2212 gufv) < 0, (34)\nand hence that\nD2fu + D1gv > 0, (D2fu + D1gv)2 > 4D1D2(fugv \u2212 gufv), (35)\nfor an allowed value of k. For almost equal diffusion coefficients we can write D2 = D1(1+\u03b4)\nwith |\u03b4| \u0007 1. Without loss of generality we take \u03b4 > 0, which forces fu > 0. Then one finds\nthat the existence of a Turing instability requires that the constraint\n\u2212 gv\nfu\n\u2208 (1, 1 + \u03b4), (36)\nis satisfied. This entails we can immediately write gv = \u2212fu(1 + \u03c71\u03b4) for some \u03c71 \u2208 (0, 1).\nReconsidering the second inequality in each of (33) and (35) now reveals\n1 +\n\u03b42\n4\n(1 \u2212 \u03c71)2\n[1 + \u03c71\u03b4][1 + \u03b4]\n>\ngufv\nfugv\n> 1, (37)\nwhich is an extremely fine-tuned constraint to impose on the kinetics. For example, a relative\ndifference of 25% in the diffusion coefficients, corresponding to \u03b4 = 1\/4, requires a fine-tuning\nin the kinetic functions at levels which are bounded above by\n\u03b42\n4[1 + \u03b4] , (38)\nwhich is 1\/80, equivalent to 1.25%. Note that this is a bound whose attainment requires an\nadditional fine-tuning of \u03c71; taking a value of \u03c71 which is intermediate in its allowed range, for\ndefiniteness 1\/2, will require a greater fine-tuning, at the 0.3% level, for a Turing instability.\nHowever, a fine-tuning of reaction rates in the kinetics is difficult to explain in biology as\nthey are subject to abundant fluctuation [64]. Given numerous biological systems do appear\nto have at least a Turing-type behaviour; this is perhaps a paradox and thus also a challenge\nand opportunity for further modelling work to which we will return below.\n2.2. Cell movement and taxis models\nAs mentioned previously, an implicit assumption of the morphogen models is that the cellular\nresponse to the signal inherent in the distribution of morphogens occurs before, or on a much\nfaster time scale than, cell migration and growth. This assumption consequently decouples the\nmorphogen model from cell migration or growth, allowing it to be considered in isolation. It is\nobvious, however, that this assumption need not always be true, giving rise to a more complex\nInvited Article R261\nmodelling framework, where the cellular response to a signal cannot be de-coupled from cell\ndynamics.\nTaxis, in a biological context, is the preferential movement of cells towards or away from\na cue. Frequently the cue is a biochemical gradient which in a developmental context can be\nconsidered to be a morphogen, though more generally the chemical cue can be a nutrient or a\nmetabolite, for example, or the cue can be non-chemical. There are numerous forms of taxis\nthat can be observed; a non-exhaustive list includes where the cue is due to cellular adhesion\nsites (haptotaxis) [65\u201367], substrate stiffness (mechanotaxis) [68\u201370], light (phototaxis) [71],\nan electric potential (galvanotaxis) [72], a magnetic field (magnetotaxis) [73], the direction of\ngravity (geotaxis) [71, 74] and the balance of viscous and gravitational torques (gyrotaxis) [75].\nFor brevity, we will focus specifically on models which are relevant for development and\/or\nthe cue is chemotactic\u2014other forms may be treated in a similar fashion.\n2.2.1. Chemotaxis models. Chemotaxis has been implicated in many developmental settings,\nespecially in inducing and directing cell motility, leading to higher level structure on the\ndeveloping embryo. Examples include the formation of the gut (gastrulation) [10, 11], lung\nmorphogenesis [9] and feather bud formation [22]. In addition to modelling chemotaxis\nin development [76, 77], such models are also commonly considered for coat marking\npatterns [78] and swarming microbe motility [28\u201330].\nTo model chemotaxis we need equations representing the density of each motile cell\ntype. We also need equations representing the signalling molecules, which are referred to as\nchemoattractants or chemorepellents according to how they influence cell motility. Then we\nhave, in many instances,\nnt = \u2207 \u00b7 (Dn\u2207n) \u2212 \u2207 \u00b7 Jc + f(n, u), (39)\nut = \u2207 \u00b7 (Du\u2207u) + g(n, u), (40)\nwhere n and u are vectors describing cell density and chemical concentration, respectively. Dn\nand Du are diffusivity matrices, as described above for the morphogen models, though typically\nDn is positive definite rather than positive semi-definite. The functions f(n, u) and g(n, u)\ncapture signalling molecule interactions, plus typically their production and\/or degradation by\nthe cells, plus other processes such as cell proliferation and death. The term Jc describes the\nflux of cells due to chemotaxis. Given that the cell response is directional it is, in the simplest\nsetting, taken to be contingent on the gradient of the chemoattractants and chemorepellents.\nThis yields for the kth cell type\nJ ck = nk\n\u2211\ni\n\u03c7k,i(ui)\u2207ui, (41)\nso that \u03c7k,i , the chemotactic sensitivity, dictates the response of the kth cell type to the ith\nchemical. Note that if \u03c7k,i < 0, the flux is down concentration gradients and hence the cell\ntype k is repelled by chemical i. The typical forms of \u03c7k,i(ui) are\n\u03c7k,i(ui) = \u03c70\n(K + ui)j\n, (42)\nwhereK > 0,\u03c70 are constants with j \u2208 {0, 1, 2}. These functional forms emerge from receptor\nmodels [79, 80] though the specific choices of \u03c70, K , j are cell- and context-dependent.\nFigure 3 shows the results of numerical simulation of a chemotaxis model of the form\ngiven by equations (39) and (40). Specifically, we take [81, 82]\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n= \u2207 \u00b7 (D\u2207n) \u2212 \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c7n\u2207c) + rn(N \u2212 n), (43)\n\u2202c\n\u2202t\n= \u2207 \u00b7 (\u2207c) + n\n1 + n\n\u2212 c, (44)\nR262 Invited Article\n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Numerical simulation of a chemotaxis model, given by equations (43) and (44). The\nfield is initially at the homogeneous steady state, with small random perturbations added to the cell\ndensity. Diffusion-driven amplification of the heterogeneities results in a regular array of peaks\nand toughs. Zero flux boundary conditions are imposed, D = 0.25, \u03c7 = 1.9, r = 0.01 and\nN = 1.0, as in [60]. The models were solved using a finite difference scheme, including complex\nstep differentiation for the Jacobian evaluation [61].\nFigure 4.

Amplification of small perturbations in cell\ndensity across the field leads to a regular array of peaks and troughs in chemical concentration\nthat is mirrored by the cell density pattern.\n2.2.2. Mechano-chemical models: examples of taxis models in development. A paradigm\nof self-organization in the developmental setting is mesenchymal morphogenesis, where the\nmost important cue is considered to be haptotaxis [14, 15, 32]. Examples have included the\nemergence of feather buds and limb development. Such models require one to consider how the\ndensity of adhesion sites evolves with cell migration, which is typically assumed to scale with\nthe density of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM, a dense mesh of interconnected macromolecular\nfibres). Hence such models go one step further than those already described; they also have to\ntrack the stresses and strains of this hybrid material and the cells that bind to it.\nInvited Article R263\nConsequently, a typical framework for such models is [14\u201316]\nnt = \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 J + rn(N \u2212 n), (45)\nwhere rn(N \u2212 n), with r and N positive constants, represents logistic growth for cell species\nn and the flux J is given by\nJ = \u2212D\u2207n + nvt + an\u2207\u03c1. (46)\nIn the above v is the material displacement of the tissue from its equilibrium, \u03c1 is the density\nof ECM, D is a cell diffusion coefficient and a is a haptotactic coefficient. Of course, any other\ntaxis form can be included in the flux, if merited by the biology. In addition, one has to close\nthe system by considering the solid mechanics governing the evolution of the displacement\nfield v and the ECM density. Typically the ECM is considered to be convected with the tissue\ndisplacement, without decay or growth, yielding\n\u03c1t + \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c1vt ) = 0. (47)\nIn contrast, the displacement field\u2019s evolution is more complicated, governed by a balance of\nforces given that inertia is unimportant at this scale. Hence one has\n\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c3ECM + \u03c3cell) + F = 0. (48)\nHere, \u03c3ECM, \u03c3cell are, respectively, the ECM and cellular contributions to the stress tensor and\nF is an external force, if present. In the simplest approximations the ECM is treated via a\nlinear viscoelastic constitutive relation, thus relating \u03c3ECM to v and its temporal derivatives.\nThe cell contribution to the stress tensor, \u03c3cell, is modelled phenomenologically in terms of the\ntraction forces exerted by the cells via\n\u03c3cell = n1 + \u03bbn2 [\u03c4\u03c1 + \u03bb\u2207\n2\u03c1]. (49)\nThe stress due to cells, at low cell density, is proportional to the density of cells, n, and the ECM\ndensity, \u03c1, and decays at larger cell densities due to contact inhibition; \u03c4 , \u03bb are simply constant\ncoefficients. Finally a non-local term, \u22072\u03c1, is a leading order correction due to the fact that the\nforces exerted by a cell are proportional to the number of focal adhesions in contact with the\ncell, namely,\n\u222b\ncell \u03c1 dx. The Laplacian emerges as the leading order correction on expanding\nthe integrand about the centroid of the (assumed isotropic) integration domain; the fact that\nthe cell size is far smaller than other model length scales implies that higher order corrections\nare certainly negligible.\nEquations (45)\u2013(49) are a closed system once supplemented with an expression for external\nforces, F, the domain plus initial and boundary conditions. Such a system constitutes a\nmechano-chemical model and simultaneously tracks cell movements and their response to\nhaptotatic gradients.\n2.2.3. Fluid advection models. In fluid advection models, the cells are surrounded by a fluid\nwhose dynamics cannot be decoupled from the biology, akin to the coupling of solid mechanics\nand cell motility in the mechano-chemical models. An important example in development is the\nbreaking of left\u2013right symmetry which is species-dependent. In mouse, the most commonly\nstudied mammalian embryo, fluid flows induced by the motion of primary cilia within a\nsealed depression formed at the ventral side of the primitive streak, the embryological node,\nare implicated in left\u2013right symmetry breaking. The conversion of this nodal flow into a\nsymmetry breaking signal has yet to be fully explained, though numerous hypotheses are\nbeing considered. Simulations of these unsteady flow fields and transport within them assist in\nthe understanding and testing of these hypotheses, an area of intense active research reviewed\nelsewhere [2, 3].\nR264 Invited Article\n2.3. Illustrating comparisons between experiment and modelling\nThe application of morphogen models to Drosophila patterning is widespread; an approach\nemployed by Eldar and co-workers [83] used PDE models to investigate the robustness of\ngradients in the wing disc. Combined studies involving model-building and experimentation\nwere used to explore feedback loops for ligand degradation. Numerical screens for robust\nnetworks were able to identify self-enhanced ligand degradation as a possible underlying\nmechanism, and experimental observations are consistent with this analysis.\nOne of the most successful examples of the application of Turing\u2019s model to a biological\nsystem comes from the work of Sick and co-workers [8] on hair follicle spacing. The authors\npostulate that a two-stage reaction\u2013diffusion mechanism underlies the periodic appearance of\nhair follicles in mouse. A first wave of patterning establishes an array of primary follicles that\nthen directs formation of the secondary follicles by controlling production terms in the model.\nPredictions from the model, such as over-expression of the activator leading to increased\nfollicular density, were verified experimentally, thus providing increased support for a Turing\nmechanism underlying this process. Figure 4 shows the results of numerical simulation of\nboth primary and secondary stages of the modelling process, with predictions from activator\nover-expression also shown.\nAsai and co-workers hypothesized that a Turing model underlies the formation of pigment\npatterns on the skin of the angelfish Pomacanthus and zebrafish [26, 84]. By varying a single\nparameter in a simple reaction\u2013diffusion model, they were able to obtain a variety of patterns\nfound to occur in wild type and mutant lines; illustrative results of this study are shown in\nfigure 5 for zebrafish. The authors are also able to suggest that the leopard gene may regulate\nthe kinetics of activator synthesis\u2014cloning and molecular analyses are now needed to provide\na full interpretation of their results.\nMiura and co-workers [62] applied Turing\u2019s model to a slightly more complex case: they\nconsidered digit formation on a growing domain and showed that a simple reaction\u2013diffusion\nsystem can reproduce the patterns observed in Doublefoot mice by assuming saturation of the\nactivator kinetics.\nThere are, however, cases in which such models have been proven incorrect for modelling\nself-organization. The striped expression of Drosophila gap and pair-rule genes seem to\nbe one such example in which the elegant Turing models are inapplicable [85]: specific\ninstructions from each gap gene protein seem to direct the formation of the pair-rule stripes.\nNonetheless, such models provide an excellent starting point from which to begin investigating\nself-organization\u2014hypotheses and ideas which stem from theoretical investigation have the\npotential to direct experimental research in an evidence-based fashion, an efficient approach\ngiven the plethora of possible mechanisms underlying biological phenomena.\n2.4. Model comparisons\nA natural question to ask is whether one can distinguish between these models either\nmathematically or biologically? Most of the mathematical studies begin with linear analysis\nwhich looks for eigenfunctions of the Laplacian and in such cases it is the shape of the domain\nand boundary conditions that determine the patterning, rather than the details of the model\nitself. Thus, any differences need to be determined at the nonlinear level and, while there\nhave been quite a lot of studies of Turing and chemotaxis models in the nonlinear regime,\nlittle has been done on the mechano-chemical models owing to their complexity [86, 87]. It\nhas been shown that Turing and chemotaxis models can both exhibit spiked solutions and that\nthese can move in space and coalesce [88]. It has also been shown that all these models can\nInvited Article R265\nFigure 5. Comparison of numerical simulation of a Turing model for zebrafish pigmentation with\nbiological observations [84]. A range of fish mutant in the leopard gene are shown, with the\nvariation of the pattern from the WT increasing from left to right. The range of patterns can be\ncapitulated by gradual variation in a single parameter of the Turing model.

Given that patterns emerge from\nthese models due to the same principle of short-range activation, long-range inhibition, it is\nhardly surprising that it is difficult to distinguish between them.\nFrom a biological point of view it is difficult in many cases to determine if pattern arises\ndue to a chemical pre-pattern or due to cell condensation (aggregation) because at the moment\nit is very difficult experimentally to distinguish between cause and effect. However, there are\nexamples of where this has been done [92].\n2.4.1. Propagating patterns. Many patterning processes in biology take place behind\ntravelling fronts. For example, feather bud formation in vivo takes places sequentially: on\nthe dorsal tract (as shown in figure 1) an initial row of feather buds forms along the head\u2013tail\naxis and subsequent rows form in an ordered fashion, propagating out from the midline [93, 94].\nAs mentioned in section 2.4, each of the models described here is able to display propagating\npattern formation, via initial conditions involving a localized perturbation to the homogeneous\nsteady state. In order to illustrate this result, figures 6(a) and (b) show the results of simulating\nthe cell-chemotaxis system given by equations (43) and (44) with the fields initially at the\nhomogeneous steady state and a perturbation added to the cell density at the origin.\nHowever, these types of models, with initial conditions perturbed locally about a\nsteady state, are unsuitable for modelling the majority of biological systems due to their\ninherent inability to buffer against perturbations. Any perturbation in constituent densities\nR266 Invited Article\n(a) Cell density\nDistance (x)\nTi\nm\ne \n(t)\n \n \n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n(b) Chemical concentration\nDistance (x)\nTi\nm\ne \n(t)\n \n \n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n(c) Cell density with two disturbances\nDistance (x)\nTi\nm\ne \n(t)\n \n \n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n(d) Cell density with maturation\nDistance (x)\nTi\nm\ne \n(t)\n \n \n0 20 40 60 80 100\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nFigure 6.

The field is initially at the\nhomogeneous steady state, with small random perturbations added to the cell density around x = 0.\nWe see a pattern of regions of high cell density\/chemical concentration interspersed with regions\nof low cell density\/chemical concentration propagating out from the point of initial disturbance.\n(c) Disturbances to the steady state cell density at both x = 0 and x = 80 initiate two propagating\nwaves of patterning.

In each case\nzero flux boundary conditions are imposed, D = 0.25, \u03c7 = 1.9, r = 0.01, c = 0.08 and N = 1.0,\nas in [60], and the models were solved using the MATLAB function pdepe.\nor concentrations away from the initial point of disturbance would cause secondary waves of\npatterning to propagate from the sites of perturbation, interacting with the initial pattern and\ndestroying the directionality of pattern formation. Figure 6(c) shows the results of adding a\nsecond initial perturbation to the cell-chemotaxis system; two waves of patterning arise in this\ncase.\nWithin the context of these types of PDE models for pattern formation, one can achieve\nstability to such types of perturbation, whilst ensuring that sequential patterning takes place,\nby assuming that a bifurcation parameter changes spatio-temporally. For example, figure 6(d)\nshows the results of numerical simulation of the same cell-chemotaxis system with the\nchemotaxis parameter \u03c7 \u000b\u2192 \u03c7H(ct \u2212 x). In this way, cells in more distant regions of the\nfield gain the ability to respond to chemotactic signals later than those situated closer to x = 0.\nIn the case shown, the natural speed of pattern propagation is restricted by the rate at which\ncells become able to react to gradients in chemical concentrations and the wavelength of the\npattern is also increased.\nInvited Article R267\n\u20135 0 5 10 15\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nHead\u2013tail axis (x)\nTi\nm\ne \n(t)\n(a) Somitic factor\n\u20135 0 5 10 15\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nHead\u2013tail axis (x)\nTi\nm\ne \n(t)\n(b) Signal\n\u20135 0 5 10 15\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nHead\u2013tail axis (x)\nTi\nm\ne \n(t)\n(c) Wavefront\nFigure 7. Propagating patterns of somite formation produced by the model of Baker and co-\nworkers [13, 95, 96]. Regression of a wavefront along the head\u2013tail axis causes a series of discrete\nsignals that cause corresponding switches in the levels of somite factor from low to high. In each\ncase dark areas indicate areas of high concentration.\nAnother method for achieving such kinds of propagating patterning is to assume that the\nsystem is bi-stable and that a propagating parameter switches the system from one state to\nanother in a discrete manner. This idea has been used by Baker and co-workers [13, 95, 96]\nin the context of somitogenesis, segmentation of the head\u2013tail axis of vertebrate embryos (see\nfigure 1). In these models, the expression of a high level of a \u2018somitic factor\u2019 causes cells to\nform somites. Bi-stable kinetics coupled with a wavefront which enables cells to switch from\na low to a high level of somitic factor, via interaction with a signalling molecule, results in a\npropagating pattern of somitic factor concentration. Figure 7 shows the results of numerical\nsimulation of the model of Baker and co-workers [13, 95, 96]. These models do not suffer\nfrom the problem mentioned above because, by the nature of the bi-stable kinetics, small\nperturbations are damped.\n2.5. Outlook\nThe above models are, mainly, at the macroscopic, coarse-grained level and their principal\naim is to show how patterns can emerge from the combination of non-patterning individual\nbehaviour. They recognize that biological functions\/structures arise from an integration of more\nbasic functions, something that is only now being seen to be true by the wider community. For\ntheir time, they were adequate in that the prevailing biological data were also at the macroscopic\ncoarse-grained level. In fact, they can still be considered to be very useful paradigm models\nfor patterning on the macroscopic scale, either alone or coupled together [22, 60, 97, 98].\nThe revolution in molecular biology has led, however, to very different types of data and\ntherefore if models are to make an impact in the biological sciences they must be formulated\nat the level of the data. These data are, increasingly, at the fine-grained molecular level and\ntherefore models have to take into account the effect of small numbers (where deterministic\napproaches may be invalid and stochastic approaches more appropriate), obstacles within\nand tortuosity of tissue (calling into question the assumption of simple Fickian diffusion)\nand incorporate cell\u2013cell signalling and cell-chemical responses into higher (tissue) level\napproaches. We now consider some of the open questions that arise as a result of trying\nto incorporate these phenomena into models.\nR268 Invited Article\n3. Open problems and future challenges\nExperimentation is yielding enormous amounts of information concerning the network of\nbiological interactions underpinning the emergence of structure, plus detailed spatial and\ntemporal data mapping gene expression and cell location. In the following we consider the\nrevolution emerging from molecular biology and biological imaging, plus the challenges and\nopportunities this presents to the modelling community.\n3.1. Molecular biology and self-organization\nExperimental advances entail that the molecular mechanisms underlying self-organization in\ndevelopmental biology are being elucidated. Such developments impact throughout the area,\nproviding new data, rejecting old hypotheses and highlighting where further work is required.\nTheoretical models need to keep pace to continue to achieve their objective of guiding insight,\nsuggesting empirical tests of hypotheses and providing a unique, and complementary, means\nof probing our understanding of this complex biological field.\nAs an example of how novel data are rejecting old hypotheses, it was often assumed that\nthe \u2018activation\u2019 required for a Turing system may arise from a protein inducing the release of a\nbound version of itself from cell membranes [58]. However, a common experimental technique,\nin situ hybridization, has been developed to track and visualize the local concentration of\nspecific mRNA transcripts throughout a tissue, thus indicating transcription. In systems where\nthere is a putative Turing mechanism, such as with zebrafish mesoderm cell fates [6] or avian\nbud formation [21], the nominal activator is tracked in this manner. This indicates that the\nself-induced production of the activator is actually via gene expression, which has a substantial\nimpact on modelling formulation, as we now discuss.\n3.1.1. Gene expression time delays. Experimental observations show us that gene expression\ntakes time; any delays associated with signal transduction will simply extend this delay. Exactly\nhow much time depends on the size of the genetic sequence to be expressed. Estimates range\nfrom just over ten minutes to several hours [99, 100]. On the other hand, patterning times in\ndevelopmental processes have been estimated to be as low as 20 min [55]; a gene expression\ntime delay is thus likely to be highly significant for the fastest developmental events. Such\nobservations are exacerbated by the fact that incorporation of a gene expression time delay in a\nsimple Turing system reveals that time delay can induce a disproportionate retardation, much\ngreater than the gene expression delay, in the time to patterning and, on growing domains, can\ncause patterning failure [101]. Thus the effects of the time delay are far from trivial. These\nresults are illustrated in figure 8 where a selection of numerical simulations from the paper\nof Gaffney and Monk [101] are presented. For exponential domain growth, with a doubling\ntime of two days, the authors were able to show that even relatively small delays greatly\ninfluenced the patterns formed, with eventual failure for longer, though not unreasonable,\ndelays.\nAny self-organizing system reliant on gene expression for structure formation on time\nscales which are not substantially greater than the gene expression time delay is potentially\nsusceptible to the effects of this delay. Due to the need for activation this includes putative\nTuring systems. Modelling opportunities arise in investigating current models to ascertain\nwhether gene expression delays have substantial effects. Numerous further questions arise.\nFor example, can mathematical modelling classify when gene expression time delays may\nbe neglected in a given pattern forming system? Will a gene expression time delay induce\noscillations should any gene products form a negative feedback loop? Are the stability and\nInvited Article R269\nFigure 8.

The domain\ndoubling time is 2 days and the time delays are marked on each individual plot in units of 12 min.\nThe vertical axis is the (square) domain length, which is monotonically increasing in time, and the\nhorizontal axis is the spatial coordinate of the simulations. Tdel denotes time delay and IC the\ninitial conditions. It is easy to see that, for both sets of initial conditions (given in [101]), time\ndelays have a marked effect on the pattern formed, with eventual failure.

What happens\nwhen time delays are considered within a large network of interacting morphogens?\n3.1.2. Networks, systems and synthetic biology, parameter estimation. Typically, the\nmodelling of pattern formation in biology has relied upon putative models with a small number\nof interactions, with the canonical example of two morphogens in Turing\u2019s model. This was\nreasonable before the revolution in molecular biology; however, to be realistic in this day\nand age, models must be more detailed as substantially more information is available for\nutilization and investigation in biological modelling. An informative example is the study of a\nmodel of gene product interactions, as illustrated in figure 9, in the determination of segment\npolarity in Drosophila [102]. With over 100 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and 48\nadjustable parameters, it was still possible to use modelling tools to demonstrate that the current\nnetwork representing gene interactions could not explain observed patterning events but simple\nadditions to the network could. The inability to estimate parameters was compensated for by\nR270 Invited Article\nPTC\nCNCID\nWGwg\nptc\nenEN\ncid\nPH PH\nPTC\nHH HH\nen\nWG\nhh\n+\ncell cell-cell\ninterface\nneighbour\ncell\nFigure 9.

However, this\nis where a balance must be struck between biological accuracy and the ability of the modeller\nto fully explore the system using both analytical and numerical tools. Such comments are not\nreserved for development either. The networks underpinning signal transduction in bacterial\nchemotaxis are also being elucidated [103], and modelling frameworks are being developed\nto incorporate such information into macroscale PDE models [80].\nWhile molecular biological methods often reveal interactions, quantitative estimates of\nreaction rates, for example, are rare. This is problematic, especially for moving in the\ndirection of larger models. Qualitative techniques will be especially valuable for such\nstudies. For example, graph theory can be applied to study the stability of large networks of\nODEs [104, 105]. Note that the applied study of the linear stability of PDEs typically involves\nthe reduction to ODEs via an expansion in the eigenfunctions of the transport operator. Thus\ngraph theoretic techniques are applicable in the context of biological networks with pattern\nforming properties in revealing aspects of stability properties from network topologies rather\nthan network dynamics.\nOne can also adopt the approach of performing a random sampling of parameter\nspace [102]. This can be highly revealing even when an exhaustive sampling is impossible, and\nfurther opens up the possibility of examining the role of biological networks in patterning. The\nlatter task, which will be enormously demanding computationally, emphasizes the vital exercise\nInvited Article R271\nFigure 10.

This is certainly possible\nwith biological systems as large as those envisaged even in the current context [106\u2013108].\nIn addition, while parameter estimates can be rare, they should be considered when\navailable. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) techniques, for example, have\nbecome widely available for measuring diffusion coefficients in realistic environments [109,\n110]. Sometimes parameter estimates can highlight modelling difficulties, as with our\nprevious observations that in the absence of large diffusivity ratios for putative Turing\nmorphogens, there is unreasonable parameter fine-tuning. However such difficulties often\npresent novel opportunities. In the current context, the complexity of both networks and\nthe cellular microenvironment can allow Turing-style patterns without parameter fine-tuning.\nFor example, a model with more than two reactants has successfully shown a Turing\ninstability with equal diffusion coefficients for ATP and ADP given realistic glycolytic reaction\nrates [111]. Analogous comments apply for pattern formation models considering the intra-\nand extracellular environments coupled via signal transduction [112]. These exemplify how\nthe additional biological phenomena discussed in this section, and below, represent potential\nresolutions of fundamental and paradoxical difficulties in proposed mechanisms of biological\nself-organization, rather than distracting and unnecessary complications.\nAs a final motivation for larger scale models, we mention an exciting experimental\ndevelopment, namely, the prospect of synthetic multicellular systems for artificial pattern\nformation [113]. While prototypical, such studies illustrate how genetically engineered\nreceiver cells can be designed to sense a chemical gradient and undergo a desired pattern\nformation\u2014an example of this is shown in figure 10. Highly amenable to mathematical\nmodelling, pattern formation by design has broad potential application areas including tissue\nengineering, biosensing and bio-directed fabrication [113]. Such systems will be substantially\nmore complicated than a Turing pair however. For example, a prospective mechanism for\nsharpening the edges of artificial patterns could make use of the biological mechanisms of\nsegment polarity in Drosophila [113], requiring O(100) equations for the relevant network\ninteractions [102].\nR272 Invited Article\nThus, in summary, a major challenge in the modelling of biological pattern formation is\nto consider coupling of large networks, with significantly more than two interacting proteins,\nplus subcellular dynamics, to support understanding not only of biological systems but also in\nthe context of synthetic biological design.\n3.2. Noise and robustness\nA fascinating advance in molecular biology is the development of in vivo genetic reporter\nsystems, that is the genetic expression, and subsequently tracking, of fluorescent proteins\nat the cellular level, as illustrated in our discussion on synthetic biology. This technique\nadditionally has allowed the investigation of noise in the gene expression underlying biological\nself-organization processes such as embryonic development [114\u2013116]. Noise is observed\nto be present in general with two types of source: (i) intrinsic variability caused by, for\nexample, fluctuations in promoter activation and deactivation, mRNA and protein production\nand decay; (ii) extrinsic variability, defined as \u2018fluctuations and population variability in the\nrate constants associated with these events\u2019 [117] and typified by changes in temperature and\ncellular conditions. Robustness is usually defined as the ability of a system to buffer against\nsuch fluctuations, so that a mechanism may reproducibly deliver a required output. It is\nexemplified by the fact that, for most genes, heterozygous pairs do not lead to an apparent\nphenotype [64].\nOne may subsequently speculate that noise on the individual cell level will not impact\non modelling at larger scales, given that even small biological systems consist of substantial\ncell numbers. However, numerous individual-based stochastic effects manifest themselves\nat higher scales, and an open area of research is the understanding of when such cell-\nbased fluctuations are indeed negligible. Here we outline two examples where they are not:\n(i) stochastic-induced switching between stable steady states in a bi-stable system; (ii) errors\nin differentiation signals inherited from the effects of fluctuations on morphogen gradients.\nStochastic switching. We demonstrate the effects of stochasticity upon bi-stable systems\nusing an example presented by Erban and co-workers [118]: consider the following scheme of\nreactions for a chemical A,\n2A k1\u2192 3A, 3A k2\u2192 2A, \u2205 k3\u2192 A, A k4\u2192 \u2205. (50)\nOne may write down a simple ODE to describe the system using the law of mass action [119]:\nd[A]\ndt\n= \u2212k2[A]3 + k1[A]2 \u2212 k4[A] + k3, (51)\nwhere [A] denotes the concentration of A. It is easy to see that the system, given the\nparameter values detailed in the caption of figure 11, has two stable steady states, given by\n[A]s = 100, 400, and one unstable steady state, given by [A]u = 220. Analysis of the system\nshows that phase trajectories with [A](0) < 220 will converge to the lower steady state, whilst\nthose with [A](0) > 220 will converge to the upper one. The system may, however, be re-\ninterpreted as a continuous time Markov chain and investigated using the Gillespie stochastic\nsimulation algorithm (SSA) [120]. A very different behaviour is observed\u2014stochastic effects\nallow the system to \u2018jump\u2019 between the two steady states.\nThe results of two realizations of the system are shown in figure 11. The long time scale\nsimulation allows us to see switching between the two stable steady states, as a result of the\ninherent stochasticity in the system\u2014this is not, by contrast, achievable with the deterministic\nPDE model.\nInvited Article R273\n0 1 2\n0\n250\n500\nTime (min)\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf m\nol\nec\nul\nes\n(a) Short time scale\n0 50 100\n0\n250\n500\nTime (min)\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf m\nol\nec\nul\nes\n(b) Long time scale\nFigure 11.

Diffusion can also be represented\nin a stochastic manner. Consider, for example, the system\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= D\u22072u \u2212 \u03bbu, (52)\nin one spatial dimension, where u represents the morphogen concentration, \u03bb the rate of linear\ndecay andD the diffusion rate of morphogen. Numerical simulation of the system for x \u2208 [0, 1]\nwith a flux of morphogen at the left-hand boundary and reflecting conditions at the right-hand\nboundary is shown in figure 12(a). A steady gradient is formed which decreases monotonically\nover the domain. The idea behind Wolpert\u2019s French Flag model [45] is illustrated in the figure:\ncells on the domain which experience u \u0002 60 become \u2018blue\u2019, those with 30 \u0001u < 60 become\n\u2018white\u2019 and those with u < 30 become \u2018red\u2019.\nFigure 12(b) shows the result of simulating the same system using a Gillespie\napproach [120]. The idea involves dividing the domain up into k equally sized boxes such that\nthe following diffusion \u2018reactions\u2019 take place:\nu1\nd\u2192 u2 d\u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 d\u2192 uk\u22121 d\u2192 uk, uk d\u2192 uk\u22121 d\u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 d\u2192 u2 d\u2192 u1, (53)\ntogether with the flux and decay equations\n\u2205 r\u2192 u1 and ui \u03bb\u2192 \u2205, for i = 1, . . . , k, (54)\nwhere ui , i = 1, . . . , k, represents the number of morphogen molecules in box i. The diffusion\nconstants D and d are related via the expression d = D\/(\rx)2, where \rx is the box width.\nWe see that there are several boxes which become \u2018incorrectly\u2019 specified via the stochastic\nrealization, compared with the deterministic PDE description.\nGiven the phenomena just outlined, we now proceed to consider another active research\nfield, addressing how such noise may be buffered.

Mechanisms for buffering against noise. No matter how well regulated, any biological\nsystem is still influenced to some degree by stochastic effects and a number of theories have\nbeen put forward to explain the apparent robustness of systems to such noise. For example, the\nexistence of large gene networks has been postulated to improve robustness by incorporating\nfeedback loops that buffer against fluctuations and also by allowing for redundancy. However,\nthe mechanisms which buffer against fluctuations to yield robustness, especially in fields such\nas developmental biology, are still a subject of much debate. Here we outline a few examples\nwhere modelling has been used to demonstrate the ability of systems to filter out noise or to\npostulate a mechanism to increase robustness to the effects of noise.\nTostevin and colleagues [121] have recently argued, using mathematical techniques, that\nthere are fundamental limits to position determination by morphogen gradients. They propose\nthat time-averaging of a single gradient can lead to great precision even in the limit of very\nlow protein copy numbers and that there exists an optimal length scale for the gradient in order\nfor precision to be achieved. Dessaud and co-workers [46] show that some form of temporal\naveraging is at work during chick limb specification; they show that changing the time and level\nof exposure to Shh have equivalent effects on intracellular signalling. However, that temporal\naveraging is employed to increase robustness to fluctuating signals is yet to be definitively\ndemonstrated.\nA textbook example of the ability of a developmental system to buffer against fluctuations\ncomes from the work of Kruse and co-workers [122\u2013124]: they investigated the roles of\ndiffusive versus transcytotic trafficking during morphogen gradient formation in the Drosophila\nwing disc. As a result the authors suggest, via a combination of mathematical and theoretical\ntechniques, that repeated internalization and externalization of the ligand Dpp provides a more\nstable mechanism for gradient formation by buffering against variability in the flux of Dpp\nInvited Article R275\n0 1 2 3\n0\n8\n16\nDistance (x)\nCo\nnc\nen\ntra\ntio\nn \n(u)\n(a) n=1\n0 1 2 3\n0\n4\n8\nDistance (x)\nCo\nnc\nen\ntra\ntio\nn \n(u)\n(b) n=2\n0 1 2 3\n0\n1\n2\nDistance (x)\nCo\nnc\nen\ntra\ntio\nn \n(u)\n(c) n=10\nFigure 13.

We also note that the interaction of multiple gradients has been proposed\nas a model mechanism for complex patterning [125, 126].\nSelf-enhanced ligand degradation. One simple example of the use of mathematical models\nto suggest robust mechanisms comes from the work of Eldar and colleagues [64, 83] into the\nmechanisms underlying morphogen gradient formation. The authors used a PDE of the form\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= D\u22072u \u2212 \u03bb(u), (55)\nin one spatial dimension to describe the kinetics of morphogen concentration, u. A flux\nof morphogen at the left-hand boundary, together with suitable conditions at the right-hand\nboundary and an initial distribution of morphogen were also assumed. The authors carried out\nextensive computational screening of the system using different diffusion and flux rates and\nassuming different forms for morphogen decay, \u03bb(u).\nAssuming a linear decay rate, so that \u03bb(u) = \u03bbu, results in a steady state morphogen\nprofile\nust = f\na\nexp\n(\n\u2212x\na\n)\n, where a =\n\u221a\nD\n\u03bb\n, (56)\nwhereas a nonlinear decay rate of the form \u03bb(u) = \u03bbun gives\nust = \u03b1\n(x + \u03b2)m\n, (57)\nwhere\nm = 2\nn \u2212 1 , \u03b1 =\n(\nm(m + 1)\nD\n\u03bb\n)m\/2\n, \u03b2 =\n(\nm\u03b1D\nf\n) n\u22121\nn+1\n.

Lander and co-workers have also made substantial contributions in the area,\ninvestigating, for example, the roles of diffusion and cell\u2013cell trafficking in morphogen gradient\nformation [127, 128].\nNext, we describe three \u2018error correction\u2019 mechanisms [129] that have been suggested for\nrefining tissue patterns established by graded morphogen expression.\nR276 Invited Article\nElimination of mis-positioned cells. This can occur, for example, via increased apoptosis:\ncells which express markers of a domain other than the one in which they are situated undergo\nprogrammed cell death. The phenomenon occurs in Drosophila embryos with altered Bicoid\ngradients: increased apoptosis in certain regions of the embryos counteracts the effects of\ngradient alteration [129, 130].\nSorting of mis-positioned cells. This may occur, for example, as cells sort according to\ndifferences in their adhesive properties [25, 131]. Hh signalling in the neural tube appears\nto control cell adhesion properties, thereby allowing the segregation of Hh-responding\ncells [129, 132].\nRe-specification of mis-positioned cells. This occurs, for example, when individual cells are\nunable to retain their original identity in a group of cells expressing different markers. One\ndocumented case of this occurs during inversion of pieces of somite precursor tissue at certain\npositions along the head\u2013tail axis of vertebrate embryos: normal segmentation results, despite\nchanges in the levels of FGF signalling [133].\nThese examples suggest not only that the mechanisms underlying development may be\nrobust but also that the embryo may have developed techniques with which to guard against\nenvironmental and intrinsic fluctuations.\n3.2.2. Incorporating stochastic effects into models. Given that PDE models cannot always\nbe satisfactorily applied to modelling biological systems, we now outline some stochastic\nmethods which could be considered. Our discussion will be motivated by a concrete example:\nthe description of a simple diffusion process. The PDE generally used to describe diffusion of\na chemical species C in one space dimension is\n\u2202c\n\u2202t\n= \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nD\n\u2202c\n\u2202x\n)\n, x \u2208 R, t > 0, (59)\nwhere c is the concentration of chemical C and D describes the diffusive flux. The system is\nclosed by specifying conditions as x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and an initial condition c(x, t) = c0(x).\nStochastic differential equations. The Langevin form of the diffusive process described above\ncan be written by supposing that the position of each particle evolves according to\nX(t + dt) = X(t) +\n\u221a\n2D dW(dt), (60)\nwhere dW(dt) is a normal random variable with mean 0 and variance dt and D is the\nmacroscopic diffusion constant. To simulate the behaviour of N morphogen molecules, a\nfinite time step \rt is chosen. The position of each molecule is updated according to the\nequation\nxi(t + \rt) = xi(t) +\n\u221a\n2D\rt \u03bei, i = 1, . . . , N, (61)\nwhere each \u03bei is a normally distributed random variable with zero mean and unit variance.\nFokker\u2013Planck equations.

However, it is rare that the master equation is directly simulated as, even for a few\nspecies, many hundreds of equations (one for each possible state of the system) need to be\nsimulated. Most often Monte Carlo approaches, such as the Gillespie SSA outlined earlier in\nsection 3.2, are employed.\n3.2.3. Open problems concerning noise and biological self-organization. The inclusion of\nstochastic effects in the modelling of biological systems is a comparatively new field. Hence,\nthere are numerous issues in the area, most of which remain unexplored\u2014here we outline but a\nfew of the questions to which we must begin to seek answers, in order for further understanding\nin the area.\nWhat is appropriate choice of modelling framework? This is not obvious\u2014especially in\nthe case of nonlinear kinetics\u2014and may be limited, at present, to the biological data available.\nWhat are the effects of discretizing both space and time? How do such models compare\nwith those in which both are left as continuum variables [135]? Can efficient numerical code\nbe developed to simulate large numbers of realizations of stochastic systems with multiple,\ninteracting species? This is becoming increasingly important as our knowledge of biological\nsystems at the cellular\/molecular levels increases rapidly. How may different temporal and\nspatial scales be separated using asymptotic techniques? How can cellular level, stochastic\ndynamics (including phenomena such as feedback loops, amplifiers, switches) be incorporated\ninto higher level models? Phenomena such as delays in gene transcription and translation and\ngrowth are well documented biologically, but how do they interact and how does stochasticity\nplay a role?\n3.3. Domain geometry and heterogeneity in the developmental setting\nIn the above we have seen that a major challenge in modelling is the development of methods for\ndealing with the numerous, complex biological interactions taking place during development.\nRevolutions in the coupling of molecular biology and biological imaging entail that far\ngreater knowledge is becoming available and will continue to become available, concerning\nthe detailed geometry of development. For example, spatial and temporal gene expression\nInvited Article R279\nFigure 14. The developing uterus in C. Elegans; detailed information on expression of gene\nY47G6a.7. Reproduced from [136].\nprofiles are available for approximately 10% of the genes within Caenorhabditis elegans [136];\nsimilarly detailed geometrical information of domain geometries is becoming available, as\nillustrated in figure 14. In contrast, most pattern formation models consider a very simple\ndomain, with transport modelled by Fickian diffusion. Consideration of events taking place\non the cellular level immediately reveals that the basis of assumptions such as Fickian diffusion\nof signalling molecules and cells need to be investigated in detail. This is considered below,\nmaking an assumption of geometric periodicity at the cellular level, followed by an investigation\nof the effects of the macroscale geometry on important patterning properties such as stability\nand robustness.\n3.3.1. Microgeometry: the cellular microenvironment. Consider figure 15. A priori, it is\nnot clear that one can model transport within a complex extra-cellular domain using simple,\nFickian diffusion, nor whether one can incorporate detailed intercellular dynamics in a mean-\nfield sense within pattern formation models. Below we invoke homogenization theory [137]\nto show this is indeed possible. The technique, at the simplest level, is to perform a multiple\nscales perturbation analysis; the small parameter, \u0007, is the ratio of the mesoscopic length scale,\nover which the system exhibits periodicity, to the cellular length scale, over which there is\nextensive heterogeneity. Below we will assume periodicity on the mesoscopic scale. It would\nalso be appropriate to consider media which are random on the length scale of a few cells,\nthough statistically homogeneous on the mesocopic length scale. We note that such techniques\nare common in other fields, such as the modelling of dislocations and shocks in physics [138]\nand theoretical electrophysiology [137, 139], but have yet to become standard in biological\nself-organization modelling.\nTo begin, consider the microscale equations for two extracellular species U1, U2, whose\nconcentrations in the extracellular space are denoted by u1 and u2, respectively. As we are\nconsidering the cellular level geometry, we also need to consider the dynamics on this scale. We\nassume there is a surface density of free receptors, denoted r0, which will bind to either species,\nforming bound receptors, r1 or r2, according to the binding molecule. As an example one could\nassume that the binding of U1 induces an intracellular signal which leads to the production\nof both species U1, U2 subject to inhibition due to the binding of U2. This illustrative model\nwill show, inter-alia, how receptor competition at the cell surface can be incorporated into\nmacroscopic equations.\nThe equations for the above framework are given by\n\u2202u\u03b1\n\u2202t\n= \u2207 \u00b7 (D\u03b1\u2207u\u03b1), (76)\nR280 Invited Article\nFigure 15.

Note that we do not\nhave the summation convention for the repeated Greek subscripts. On the cell surfaces, that is\non \u2202\u0003e, we also have interaction of the chemical species and receptors:\nD\u03b1n \u00b7 \u2207u\u03b1 = \u0007A\u03b1(u1, u2, r0, r1, r2), (77)\n\u2202r\u03b2\n\u2202t\n= B\u03b2(u1, u2, r0, r1, r2), (78)\nwhere\u03b2 \u2208 {0, 1, 2} and n is the normal pointing out of the extra-cellular domain. We keep these\ncell surface interactions in a general setting during the model formulation stage to emphasize\nthe universal application of this technique.\nIn practice, the scaling with \u0007 for the surface fluxes in equation (78) emerges during\nnon-dimensionalization, as illustrated in cardiac electrophysiological modelling [139, 140].\nHowever, one can anticipate the above scalings; as \u0007 tends to zero, with the macroscopic length\nscale fixed, and the cellular length scale decreasing, the surface area per cell scales with \u00072.\nThe number of cells in a fixed macroscopic volume scales with 1\/\u00073 and thus for a fixed surface\ndensity of receptors, the number of receptors in a unit macroscopic volume would scale as 1\/\u0007\nas \u0007 \u2192 0. To avoid a divergence, or an absence of, receptors in the asymptotic limit, one must\nhave the receptor surface-density scaling with \u0007. For typical receptor dynamics, the functions\nA\u03b1 and B\u03b2 will be homogeneous degree one in receptor density, giving the above on a simple\nrescaling of r0, r1 and r2 to \u0007-independent densities. Of course, the biophysical parameters\nused for non-dimensionalization, and thus \u0007, are fixed; we simply find an approximation to the\nmodelling equations which is accurate under the well-justified assumption that \u0007 \u0007 1.3\nTo implement the multiple scales analysis, let x denote the spatial coordinates which vary\non the macroscopic length scale; similarly, y = x\/\u0007 are the spatial coordinates which vary\n3 The biophysical parameters may in fact indicate that an excellent approximation is achieved with the absence of\nreceptors or for a large receptor reservoir, which would yield different scalings to those above; we implicitly assume\nthat no such simplifications occur in the model formulation.\nInvited Article R281\non the cellular scale.

For illustrative\npurposes, the smallest self-repeating unit is depicted as a cuboid, whose edges are shown in blue.\nIn general this contains several cells, or parts of cells, as illustrated in orange; it is also, for\ndefiniteness, taken to contain the point x. The domain \u0003p considered in the text is the extracellular\nspace contained within the depicted cuboid. The boundary \u2202\u0003p is equal to the union of \u2202\u0003p \u2229\u2202\u0003e\nand \u2202\u0003p\\(\u2202\u0003e \u2229\u0003p), where \u0003e denotes the extracellular space; in particular, neither \u2202\u0003p \u2229 \u2202\u0003e\nnor \u2202\u0003p\\(\u2202\u0003e \u2229 \u0003p) is empty in general.\nw\u03b11 = w\u03b12, at least to within a constant; the fact that w\u03b11, w\u03b12 are only uniquely defined up\nto a constant will not be important below.\nWe are now in a position to homogenize. Note that in the multiple scales asymptotic\napproximation one seeks solutions treating the spatial variables x and y as independent once\nany differential operators have been expanded via equation (79) and its analogues [141]. Thus,\nthe multiple scales approach allows us to integrate equation (85) with respect to the cellular\nscale variable y over \u0003p. On dividing through by the volume of \u0003p, and using (85), (87) and\n(88), to eliminate u1\u03b1 , u2\u03b1 we obtain\n\u2202u0\u03b1\n\u2202t\n= D\u03b1\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u03b4ij +\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u222b\n\u0003p\n\u2202w\u03b1i\n\u2202yj\ndVy\u222b\n\u0003p\ndVy\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe\n\u22022u0\u03b1\n\u2202xi\u2202xj\n+ \u03bbA\u03b1(u\n0\n1, u\n0\n2, r\n0\n0 , r\n0\n1 , r\n0\n2 ). (89)\nThe parameter \u03bb is the area of \u2202\u0003e \u2229 \u2202\u0003p divided by the volume of \u0003p, which is equivalent to\nthe surface area\u2013volume ratio of the extracellular domain. Note that our homogenized equation\ndepends only on derivatives of w\u03b11, w\u03b12 and is thus unique despite the fact that w\u03b11, w\u03b12 are\nunique only up to a constant. We also have the zero order receptor equations\n\u2202r0\u03b2\n\u2202t\n= B\u03b2(u01, u02, r00 , r01 , r02 ), (90)\nwhich depend on x and t , but not y, as required for consistency. Thus equations (88)\u2013(90)\ndictate how the cellular level features, such as the microgeometry and receptor dynamics, are\nincorporated into macroscopic models, accurate to leading order in \u0007.\nIn particular, note that microscale anisotropy will manifest in a more complicated\nmacroscale diffusion operator and receptor dynamics are inherited essentially unchanged\nInvited Article R283\nat the larger scale. These dynamics could be based upon simply the law of mass action\nor include, for example, simple representations of a gene expression time delay. A similar\nprocedure, explicitly taking into account the cell interior, could readily incorporate a coupling\nof the receptors with signal transduction pathways and intracellular dynamics, allowing the\nsystematic construction of multiscale models for the interaction of subcellular and supercellular\nphenomena.\nAn important constraint for the application of this procedure is that a mean-field\napproximation is appropriate. For example, it would not be immediately applicable to the\nfine-grained patterning associated with delta-notch lateral inhibition as a discrete cellular-\nscale model is required [1]. Such exceptions aside, this homogenization procedure provides a\nframework for the construction of a single multiscale model for variations on the macroscale\nwhich incorporates (i) cellular level geometrical data from imaging, (ii) the ever increasing\ndetails becoming available at the networks and pathways level and (iii) cell surface kinetic data\nderived from FRAP studies [110].\nThis also serendipitously highlights a broad open challenge. Can the extensive literature on\nhomogenization procedures (e.g. [138]) be adapted to produce accurate, simpler, macroscale\nmodels of biological self-organization in the presence of discrete modelling frameworks or\nstochasticity, such as low gene expression copy number fluctuations? Complications arise in\nsuch scenarios as the smoothness and determinism of the modelling variables on the cellular\nscale would generally be absent.\n3.3.2. Macrogeometry. At the macroscale level in development, one must also consider\nthe fact that the domain is growing. Typically the domain growth rate is much slower than\nother processes, allowing an effective and simplifying decoupling. Even when the domain\ngrowth drives the system through a patterning bifurcation it is typically quasi-steady either\nside of the bifurcation point and thus the homogenization analysis of section 3.3.1 is expected\nto be legitimate. This shows that while domain growth cannot simply be ignored, it can\nbe represented by a slow time evolution of model parameters independent of microlevel\ncomplexities.\nThe consequences of domain growth upon self-organization frameworks such as the\nmorphogen or Turing models have been investigated extensively using PDEs and the\nconservation approach [142\u2013145]. Starting, once again, from the basic format assumed in\nequation (1) we have\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u222b\n\u0003a\nu(x, t) dx = \u2212\n\u222b\n\u2202\u0003a\nJ \u00b7 ds +\n\u222b\n\u0003a\nf(u, x, t) dx, (91)\nwith the same notation. Supposing that \u0003a(t) is an arbitrary volume in a time-varying domain\n\u0003(t), we draw on the Reynolds transport theorem [146] to express the left-hand side as\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u222b\n\u0003a\nu(x, t) dx =\n\u222b\n\u0003a\n[\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+ \u2207 \u00b7 (au)\n]\ndx, (92)\nwhich gives\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+ \u2207 \u00b7 (au) = \u2207 \u00b7 J + f(u, x, t), (93)\nwhere a is the flow due to domain growth. On incorporating domain growth, two new terms\nemerge in the model: the first, a \u00b7 \u2207u, is an advection term which corresponds to flow due to\nlocal growth and the second, u\u2207 \u00b7 a, to the dilution effects of local volume change.\nA Lagrangian description may be applied to the problem:\nx = \u0393(X, t), x \u2208 \u2126(t), (94)\nR284 Invited Article\nwhere X is the initial position of an element moving in the flow, a, so that \u0393(X, 0) = X. The\nlocal flow can then be specified as\na(X, t) = \u2202x\n\u2202t\n= \u2202\u0393\n\u2202t\n, (95)\nwhere the mechanical properties of the tissue have been ignored and growth only assumed to\noccur due to local volumetric increase [147].\nCrampin and co-workers considered pattern formation in Turing-type reaction\u2013diffusion\nmodels with domain growth. Beginning with slow isotropic growth, they demonstrate\npattern formation under different types of growth function and show that domain growth\nmay be a mechanism for increased robustness of pattern formation [147]. In a further\nwork, they generalize their results to non-uniformly growing domains, showing that weak\nspatial heterogeneity does not alter pattern selection from the uniform case, but that sufficient\nnonuniformity can give rise to new pattern sequences [145].\nCrampin and co-workers further extended their study to consider Turing instabilities when\ngrowth was coupled to morphogen concentration [145]. However, they did not consider any\nspecific biological applications. Baker and co-workers [142] consider simple morphogen\nmodels, in which local morphogen concentrations were assumed to control cell proliferation\n(and hence domain growth) in a manner similar to that shown to control cell proliferation in\nthe Drosophila wing disc [148]: growth could either arise if the gradient or the absolute levels\nof Dpp concentration were above certain thresholds. In certain limits, they were able to derive\nanalytical expressions describing domain growth over time.\nFurther to this work, Neville et al [149] considered the pattern forming potential of the\nSchnakenberg model on growing domains, comparing isotropic, exponential domain growth\nwith scenarios with biochemically controlled growth. They demonstrated, via numerical\nsimulations and weakly nonlinear analysis, that despite a complex interplay between the effects\nof chemicals on the domain and the influence of the domain on the patterns formed, domain\ngrowth increases the tendency of the uniform steady state to form patterns.\nHowever, all such models consider very simple geometries, and thus an interesting\ndevelopment will be pattern formation on differential manifolds incorporating, for example,\nthe Laplace Beltrami operator for diffusive processes [150, 151]. In addition, numerous open\nproblems emerge when considering how to cross the scale between movement on cellular scales\nand global domain growth. One example is the generalization of the above homogenization\nprocedures when microscale periodicity is absent. Another example is revealed on noting that,\nin contrast to individual cell motion during mesenchymal morphogenesis, numerous migratory\nmovements during development occur via cell sheets. Self-organization models taking into\naccount such coordinated movement are in their infancy and determining how to incorporate\ndetailed cell sheet movements within domain growth via mean-field equations represents a\nmajor challenge.\nWe conclude this section by noting that pattern formation under the influence of\ndomain growth, and the resultant increased levels of robustness, is an example of sequential\ninduction [1], whereby a complicated pattern is reliably formed by a sequence of patterning\nforming events, as, indeed, suggested by Turing. Sequential induction is considered to be\na common mechanism throughout development, with differential gene expression acting\ntemporally as well as spatially [1]. Consequently, it is clear that, more generally, the\nslow evolution of parameters within biological models of pattern formation should also be\ninvestigated in detail to see how temporal regulation can assist in invoking and maintaining\npattern.\nInvited Article R285\n4. Summary\nWe began this work by outlining some of the areas in which PDEs have already been used\nto model developmental systems, sketching a derivation of the PDE formulation using the\nprinciple of conservation and discussing the suitability of PDEs for modelling biological\nsystems. In section 2 we gave an overview of some classical paradigm models, showing\nsome of the mathematical techniques commonly used in their analyses and presenting results\nof numerical simulations. In section 3 we discussed some of the most pertinent open problems\nin the area, including the integration of large amounts of molecular data and noise.\nThe future of PDE modelling in developmental biology now lies in researchers embracing\nchallenges such as those summarized here. We must be respectful of the fact that simple models\ndo have many advantages\u2014not least their amenability to analytical exploration\u2014whilst being\naware of the enormous complexity of biological systems now becoming apparent with the\nrecent revolution in molecular biology.\nAcknowledgments\nREB would like to thank Microsoft Research for a European Postdoctoral Fellowship, Research\nCouncils, UK, for an RCUK Fellowship in Mathematical Biology and St Hugh\u2019s College,\nOxford for a Junior Research Fellowship.
