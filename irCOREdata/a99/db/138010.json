Hunt coined the term \u201cstrategic \ngroups\u201d to describe  \"a group of firms within the industry that are highly symmetric with \nrespect to cost structure, the degree of vertical integration, and the degree of product \ndifferentiation, formal organization, control systems, management rewards\/punishments, and \nthe personal views and preferences for various possible outcomes\"  (Hunt, 1972, p.8). Since \nthen the most commonly used definition of strategic groups has been that provided by Porter: \n\u201cA strategic group is the group of firms in an industry following the same or a similar \nstrategy along the strategic dimensions\u201d (Porter, 1980, p.129). Porter extended Hunt\u2019s \noriginal idea to include indirect effects leading to different strategies between firms, notably \nthe existence of market entry barriers. (Porter, 1976, Porter, 1979). A further definition is that \nprovided by Cool, who described a strategic group as \u201ca set of firms competing within an \nindustry on the basis of similar combinations of scope and resource commitments\u201d (Cool and \nSchendel, 1987b). The implication is that firms in a strategic group compete adopting similar \nstrategies and resources, leading to intra-industry segmentation. \n \nFollowing this initial exploration of the phenomenon of strategic groups, research blossomed. \nThe idea of groups of firms acting along similar strategic dimensions within industries \n(Porter, 1980) brought together the ideas of industrial organization, with a primary focus on \nthe industry, with those of strategic management  focused on the individual firm. In terms of \nanalysis, the strategic group can be viewed as a middle ground between the industry and the \nfirm (Porter, 1980, Oster, 1994). Thus, the idea of strategic groups enriched the industrial \norganization perspective and provided a convenient taxonomy for strategic management \nresearchers to compare and contrast groups of firms. \n \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, as research into strategic groups expanded so a number of problems \narose.  Broadly this was because of inconsistency in the variables selected for analysis and \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 3\nthe techniques used to classify groups, as well as the differing objectives of researchers. For \nexample in IO, the principle focus was on understanding the level of rivalry within the \nindustry and its impact upon industry performance (Cool and Dierickx, 1993). Most studies \nencompassed a multi-industry context and employed very general, arguably almost blunt \nmeasures to define strategic groupings. Employing similar variables to identify strategic \ngroups across industries, the common practice in IO based studies entailed trade offs and \ninconsistencies that arguably compromised accurate identification of strategic groups (Cool \nand Schendel, 1987b). Porter provided guidance on 13 possibly dimensions for defining \nstrategic groups, but in his own empirical work tended to adopt a sole dimension, such as size \nor advertising (Porter, 1973, Porter, 1979). This method was pursued by subsequent \nresearchers, such as Primeaux and Oster (Oster, 1982, Primeaux, 1985). The underlying \nassumption was that strategic groups invest in one or more mobility barriers that provide the \nstructural impediments to allow significant and sustained performance differences to exist \nbetween groups of firms. \n \nIn contrast to the IO studies, most strategic management research has focused on one \nindustry, with the twin aims of explaining firm performance and performance differences \nbetween strategic groups, usually in the context of a domestic market. A point of agreement \nbetween the majority of strategic management and industrial organization theorists, however, \nhas been that persistent performance differences exist between strategic groups. This in spite \nof the fact that most empirical studies have failed to demonstrate conclusively the clear and \nconsistent linkage between strategic groups and performance predicted in the work of Hunt \n(Hunt, 1972) and Porter (Porter, 1973).  \n \nIn this paper we discuss the evolution of strategic group research since the 1970s and discuss \nits on-going value in strategic management research: is it a rich research vein or simply a \nworn out old seam? In spite of controversy as to whether identifiable strategic groups really \nexist (Barney and Hoskisson, 1990, Dranove et al., 1998), we conclude that strategic group \ntheory still has much to offer as a focus for analysis and is superior for classification purposes \nin research to obvious alternatives such as Porter\u2019s (1980) generic strategies and Miles and \nSnow\u2019s (1978) typology.  We illustrate the continuing value of strategic group theory to \nmanagement research with reference to our on-going study of strategic groups in the UK \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 4\npharmaceutical industry. McGee (McGee, 2003) has provided an overview of strategic group \ntheory and practice. Our approach builds on this review of the origins of strategic group \nresearch and its roots in the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) paradigm in IO, by \nfocusing upon the output of strategic group research and by providing a new application. We \naccept McGee\u2019s proposition that mobility barriers are synonymous with strategic choice \n(McGee, 2003, p.268) and contribute to his ideas on strategic mapping through the use of a \nthree dimensional map to illustrate strategic groups within the UK pharmaceutical industry. \n \n \nThe Evolution of Strategic Group Theory: 1970s and 1980s \n \nFrom the beginning two schools emerged in strategic group theory, the IO school based in \neconomics and centered upon Harvard University, which included the work of Hunt, Porter, \nOster, Caves and Porter and Newman (Hunt, 1972, Newman, 1973, Porter, 1973, Caves and \nPorter, 1977, Newman, 1978, Oster, 1982), and what is sometimes referred to as the Purdue \nSchool of strategic management drawing on the writings of Hatten, Patton and Cool (Hatten, \n1974, Patton, 1976, Cool, 1985).  \n \nThe research in IO followed a similar pattern with a multi industry focus and a reliance on \navailable data on firms and various performance indices drawn primarily from available \nindustry databases, for example PIMS1 or Compustat. Utilising an essentially univariate \nstatistical analysis, where measures such as firm size (Porter, 1973, Porter, 1979), advertising  \n(Porter, 1976, Oster, 1982) or relationships with other industries (Newman, 1973) were taken \nas proxies for strategy, an underlying belief of all the IO studies was that performance varied \nbetween strategic groups. This idea stemmed from Hunt and is  essentially rooted in the SCP \nparadigm within IO (Mason, 1949, Bain, 1959). Formulating competitive strategy in an \nindustry is seen as \u201cthe choice of which strategic group to compete in\u201d(Porter, 1980, p.149) \nand the principle aim is to explain performance. Entry to a market may well be a question of \nchoosing the \u201cloose brick\u201d (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990), that is to say, the strategic group that \nis easiest to enter and which best fits the resource profile of the firm.  \n \n                                                 \n1 PIMS is an abbreviation for the Profit Impact of Marketing Study database. \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 5\nIn contrast to the approach in IO, the research undertaken at Purdue University in the 1970s \nwas more rooted in what is now called strategic management theory. It was based on the idea \nthat strategic groups provide a useful analytical tool to aggregate firms into those following \nsimilar strategies, with a view to comparing and contrasting them.  Sparked by the \nobservation that profitable positions are not a function of firm size or industry concentration \nin the US brewing industry, Hatten (1974) classified the US brewing industry into seven \nstrategic groups.  He went on to demonstrate that the profitability relationship between \ngroups differed significantly from the profitability relationships for the industry as a whole \nand concluded that the industry was characterized by heterogeneous conduct that endured \nover time.  The policy conclusion was that industry-wide strategy recipes were to be avoided. \nThis approach was extended by Patton (1976), who employed the use of simultaneous \nequations to explore the relationship between various performance variables, conduct and the \nenvironment. \n \nFrom these origins, research on strategic groups then went into a phase during the 1980s \nwhere various researchers looked to verify the findings of the earlier research in different \nindustrial settings by employing different performance variables. For example, Hergert \n(Hergert, 1983) explored the incidence of strategic groups within fifty US manufacturing \nindustries, risk was independently used as a definitive variable by Ryans and Baird (Baird \nand Kumar, 1983, Ryans and Wittinck, 1985), generic strategies by Dess and Davis (Dess \nand Davis, 1984) and the industry life cycle by Primeaux (Primeaux, 1985). The research \nresults were mixed. Contemporary reviews (McGee, 1985, McGee and Thomas, 1986) \npointed to the sensitivity of strategic group analysis to the choice of variables adopted and to \nthe difficulties of comparing strategies across different industries. The conclusion was that \ndetailed knowledge and understanding of an industry and its context were necessary in order \nto specify adequately the variables to be included in any useful strategic group analysis. This \nwas a clear criticism of earlier IO studies with their application of general concepts and tools \nof analysis across industries. This critique was later picked up and adapted by Barney and \nHoskisson (Barney and Hoskisson, 1990), who argued that strategic groups are an artefact of \nthe methodology employed and that, in particular, the statistical technique of cluster analysis \ncommonly used in studies to identify strategic groupings could be problematic. Cluster \nanalysis chooses the best fit for the data between a three group or four group solution, but not \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 6\ndoes not clarify whether clustering the data is appropriate in the first place (Ketchen and \nShook, 1996). \n \nThese criticisms of strategic group theory as it had developed especially in the IO literature \nfrom 1972 to the mid-1980s led to a further phase of research. This phase focused especially \non three themes, namely: (1) the further exploration of the concept of mobility barriers \n(Mascarenhas, 1989, Mascarenhas and Aaker, 1989); (2) the stability of strategic groups over \ntime (Oster, 1982, Cool, 1985, Fiegenbaum and Primeaux, 1985, Cool and Schendel, 1987b, \nCool and Schendel, 1987a, Fiegenbaum, 1987, Fiegenbaum et al., 1987, Martens, 1988, Cool \net al., 1994); and (3) the idea of cognitive groups (Reger, 1988, Porac et al., 1994). \n \nMobility barriers \n \nResearch into mobility barriers and strategic groupings in the 1980s built on the ideas of \nCaves and Porter (Caves and Porter, 1977, Caves and Pugel, 1980). McGee concluded that \nmobility barriers are a counterpart of group structures and arise from strategic decisions \n(McGee and Thomas, 1986).  Decisions which affect the height of the mobility barrier are \ncritical and may be expected to arise as the result of judgments that \u201ccannot be readily \nimitated by firms outside the group without substantial costs, substantial elapsed time or \nuncertainty about the outcome of the decisions\u201d(McGee and Thomas, 1986, p. 150). McGee \nalso proposed a taxonomy of mobility barriers, distinguishing between market-related \nstrategies, industry-supply characteristics and firm characteristics. It is noteworthy that the \nmobility barriers included were endogenous to the firm and therefore were strategic decisions \nunder management control. \n \nMascarenhas and Aaker (Mascarenhas and Aaker, 1989) studying the performance \nimplications of strategic groups within the oil industry considered that the concept of \nmobility barriers was pivotal to the strategic group concept and proposed a further definition \nof a strategic group, namely: \u201cA grouping of businesses within an industry that is separated \nfrom other groupings of businesses by mobility barriers, barriers to entry and exit\u201d \n(Mascarenhas and Aaker, 1989, p.475). They concluded that mobility barriers are much more \nabout \u201cwho you are\u201d and are resource dependent than \u201cwhat you do\u201d or the actions taken.  \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 7\nMobility is higher between less protected similar groups because market entry requires \novercoming relatively fewer mobility barriers, a finding consistent with Caves and Porter \n(Caves and Porter, 1977) and the \u201cstepping stone\u201d idea advanced by McGee and Thomas \n(McGee and Thomas, 1986). Mascarenhas and Aaker therefore provided a research focus \nbased on a common strategy conceptualisation of strategic groups. The tacit element of \nstrategic decisions was brought more squarely into the argument. They concluded from their \nresearch that:  \u201cThe results suggest credibility for the strategic group concept motivated by \nmobility barriers ........  A high degree of group stability was observed, \u2026 indicating that \nmobility barriers did exist ...\u201d (Mascarenhas and Aaker, 1989, p.484).  \n \nMobility barriers have continued to be a key concept that underpins the idea of strategic \ngroups, providing the means by which sustained performance differences between groups can \nexist (Porter, 1980). However, mobility barriers as originally described (Caves and Porter, \n1977) included a policy of collusion in which firms acted in concert to promote their common \ninterest by building high entry barriers in order to protect group profits. This idea, analogous \nto groups of residents building the walls of a medieval city to repel invaders, was not, \nhowever, born out by subsequent research. It seemed more probable that due to the similarity \nof strategies pursued by firms within a particular strategic group, a number of firms made \nsimilar investments; for example, in research and development or the deployment of large \nsales forces. This could be prompted by following the lead of an individual firm perceived as \na reference point by other group members (Bogner, 1991, Fiegenbaum and Thomas, 1995). \nThe question of which variables to select in order to define strategic groups therefore \nbecomes a matter of which mobility barriers best describe the structural components of an \nindustry that prevent the free movement of firms between groups.  Arguably, only a handful \nof key decisions may prove to be of significance; for example, employing Porter\u2019s generic \n\u201cdifferentiation\u201d strategy (Porter, 1980), firms might invest heavily or selectively in research \nand development where patents provide an important mobility barrier. Viewed in this way, \nthe use of mobility barriers to define strategic groups becomes a process of identifying the \nkey strategic decisions that build and sustain market position within a given industry. \n \nMore recently Dranove et al (1998) exploring the conditions under which sustainable \nperformance differences may persist, reiterate that an effective mobility barrier must be in \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 8\nplace to prevent entry of imitation by outside competition, and, in addition, a group-level \neffect must occur as the result of intra-group strategic interactions (Dranove et al., 1998). \nThese research findings were later confirmed in an empirical study of the Japanese steel \nindustry (Nair and Filler, 2003). \nStrategic group stability \nOster\u2019s work on the stability of the strategic group intra-industry structures over time (Oster, \n1982) followed the methodology of Porter and defined strategic groups on the basis of high \nand low advertisers. She then explored the dynamics of strategic group membership within 19 \nconsumer goods industries between 1971 and 1977. Her principle findings were that strategic \ngroups were stable structures with a low degree of movement between groups. Oster\u2019s study \ndeserves attention because it was the first attempt to assess empirically the extent of inter-\ngroup mobility. However, the method adopted can be criticised for the use of an overly-\nsimple identification of group membership, i.e. low vs. high advertisers, and for the \nassumption that firms change group membership on an annual basis. \n \nThe work of several researchers (Cool, 1985, Fiegenbaum, 1987, Martens, 1988) on strategic \ngroup stability shared a common methodology. First, an extensive industry analysis was \nconducted in order to identify industry specific variables. These were then operationalized to \nidentify strategic groups. Second, stable strategic time periods (SSTPs) were identified \nbetween which changes in strategic group membership could be observed. Third, an \nextensive industry analysis was conducted in order to identify industry specific variables, \nwhich were then operationalized to identify strategic groups. \n \nThe three studies by Cool, Fiegenbaum and Martens explored the dynamics of strategic \ngroups over a considerable time period and attempted to illustrate consistent performance \ndifferences between groups. The work of Cool (1985) focused on the US pharmaceutical \nindustry between 1963 and 1982 and that of Fiegenbaum (1987) on the US insurance industry \nover a 15 year period. Cool found only a weak relationship between his groups and the three \nperformance variables he selected, suggesting that a reason for the insignificant inter-group \nvariation could be the significant intra-group variation found. This threw doubt on the idea \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 9\nthat group membership implies homogeneous performance and suggested that factors other \nthan mobility barriers contributed to strategic success. Recently this phenomenon, predicted \nto occur in industries with low product market heterogeneity and strong resource inimitability \n(Mehra and Floyd, 1998), has become a focus of a separate line of research which suggests \nthat firm positioning within a group has performance implications (McNamara et al., 2003). \nIn contrast to Cool\u2019s study, Fiegenbaum identified five to seven strategic groups within the \nUS insurance industry during the period of his study, and found significant performance \ndifferences between the three main strategic groups that he identified for all SSTPs (with the \nexception of his risk adjusted performance measure, which was only significant for one stable \nstrategic time period). An interesting element of the study was the attempt to measure firm \nmovement towards industry benchmarks, where Fiegenbaum found some support for the idea \nof the strategic group as a reference point. Also, in contrast to Cool, who identified four \nSSTPs over a 20 year time span, Fiegenbaum identified nine, with the majority lasting for \nonly one year.  Fiegenbaum attributed this primarily to the degree of industry turbulence \ndriven by price and regulatory changes; although it is worth noting that the US \npharmaceutical industry also faced turbulence during the 20 year period studied by Cool, so \nthis explanation may not be valid. Here the idiosyncrasy of different industries stands out, \nunderlining the difficulty of making valid comparisons between very different industries, \ndespite the similarity in methodology and performance measures chosen by both Cool and \nFiegenbaum. \n \nThe study by Martens (Martens, 1988) built on Cool\u2019s study and addressed the same industry, \npharmaceuticals, although in Martens\u2019 case across five European Community member \ncountries. Unlike Cool, who employed measures of scale, scope and performance variables, \nthe study by Martens employed six strategic stock variables (e.g. R&D expenditure) and a \nperformance variable. A longitudinal study was adopted, measuring strategic group dynamics \nencompassing 41 pharmaceutical companies over an eight year period, between 1978 and \n1985. An interesting feature of Martens\u2019 study is the use of a rivalry index to measure the \ncompetition that a firm faces within a specific market segment, in contrast to Cool (Cool, \n1985) who employed a general concentration ratio. However, in common with Cool, Martens \nfailed to find a consistent performance difference between strategic groups. According to \nMartens, \u201calthough strategic stocks create the performance potential several other \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 10\ncontrollable and uncontrollable factors determine the performance a firm will attain\u201d \n(Martens, 1988, p. 348). He further observed that the strategic group structure is not a very \nstable phenomenon in the EC pharmaceutical industry and that firms in groups that had a \nrelatively low strategic distance experienced many strategic group shifts. But one limitation \nof Marten\u2019s study is that performance was only measured in terms of an increase in weighted \nmarket share. This was shown to be dependent upon the history of the firm, environmental \nconditions, the therapeutic segment in which the firm was located, and the innovation rate. \n \nThe findings of Cool and Martens for the same industry, albeit in different countries, seem to \ncast doubt upon the key idea in strategic group theory that significant performance \ndifferences will exist between groups. A problem arises, however, because cluster analysis, \nemployed by both researchers, is sensitive to the variables chosen to define groupings. \nAlthough both studies were focused upon the same industry, the variables chosen to separate \ngroups were different. Cool chose to include 15 variables describing scale, scope and \nresource commitments; while Martens concentrated solely upon R & D variables. Another \npossible weakness of both studies is that the variables used may be susceptible to \nmulticollinearity and the inclusion of several variables that are strongly correlated will act to \nbias the results. For example, Cool uses total drug store sales, percentage drug store sales in \ntotal drug sales and percentage branded generic sales in total drug sales as performance \nvariables. All of these measures may be expected to be strongly correlated.  \n \nCognitive groups \n \nAnother approach that developed in the 1980s to define strategic groups is referred to as \n\u201ccognitive research\u201d. Cognitive research is based on the notion that perception is reality and \nthat an understanding of decision processes can help to separate strategic groups. Cognitive \ngroupings may be expected to capture both participant perceptions and indications of future \naction. The cognitive research theme encompasses the idea that managers construct market \nmodels based on their personal perceptions of competition, which may differ from objective \nreality. It is assumed that \u201cthrough processes involving induction, problem solving and \nreasoning decision makers construct a mental model of the competitive environment\u201d  (Porac \net al., 1994, p. 119). These models are used both to determine who are the competition and \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 11\nwhere the corporate focus should be applied when competing. The outcome of realized \nstrategy then rests, ultimately, upon the institutional and cognitive constructions of decision \nmakers. Porac et al. introduce the idea of primary competitive groups, defined as \u201cthe \ncollection of firms that define each other as rivals\u201d (Porac et al., 1989, p. 414).  \n \nThis approach to strategic groups comprises a minimum of two beliefs. First, that the \nperceptions of managers about a firm\u2019s identity, its competitors, customers and suppliers, \ndetermine the set of transactions that link the firm with its environment. Second, that \nperceptions determine industry recipes or generic strategies, which in turn delineate the \nactions necessary to compete in the firm\u2019s operating environment. An important assumption \nfor groupings based on common perceptions is a common interpretation of external events, \nwith future resource decisions based on these interpretations. In a study of strategic group \nperceptions among Chicago bankers, Reger (Reger, 1988) found strong evidence of \nconsistent cognitive maps across respondents.  While Porac et al.(Porac et al., 1994) studying \nScottish knitwear manufacturers described the creation of cognitive communities, where \nindustry \u201cgroup think\u201d results from managers in similarly placed firms interpreting the same \nenvironmental cues and attempting to solve similar problems. More recently in a study of \nstrategic groups within the US banking industry McNamara et al questioned the belief \u201cthat \nmanagers within and across firms hold homogeneous beliefs regarding the competitive \nstructure of their industry \u2026 and find that the degree of complexity in mental models varies \nsignificantly across firms\u201d (McNamara et al., 2002, p. 167). The authors conclude that the \nmanner in which top managers enact their competitive environment may contribute to \ncompetitive advantage. \n \nA notable advantage of the cognitive research stream in strategic group theory is the \nrecognition of the importance of management perceptions in defining the competition. The \nmajor weaknesses of the research relate to the relatively small samples used in the empirical \nanalyses and the very discrete markets chosen. In the case of the Scottish knitwear market, \nfor example, Porac et al. (Porac et al., 1994) note the absence of sound, validated market data \navailable to managers. This may prompt a more active exchange of views between managers \nin participating companies than would be the case in larger, more data rich industries. It is \nalso important to note that drawing up strategic groups based on cognitive factors provides an \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 12\ninsight into intended strategy, while studies that include performance measures (Dess and \nDavis, 1984) are comparing the outputs of realized strategy. This management perspective \ndoes, however, provide the opportunity to explore the mechanism behind the observed \nchange of strategy and thus to add an additional dimension to strategic group research (Curto, \n1998).An enduring problem in this type of research, however, is that people do not always do \nwhat they say they will do - nor are they necessarily always truthful when revealing their \nintended strategy to researchers! \n \n \nStrategic Group Theory in the 1990s \n \nIn the 1990s strategic management research focused on the internal resources and \ncompetences of firms over industrial structures to explain sustained competitive advantage. In \nthe face of developments in resource-based theories of the firm, strategic group theory was \nrelatively neglected. Nevertheless, some research continued and was heavily focused on \nexploring patterns of intra-industry competition. In this context the work of Bogner (Bogner, \n1991) is particularly important. \n \nBogner looked at the US pharmaceutical market for a period of 20 years between 1969 and \n1988 and introduced the idea of the \u201ccompetitive group\u201d, which he defined as \u201can intra-\nindustry combination of firms which are following similar strategies. Where firms follow \nsimilar strategies because they have different historical backgrounds, that have provided them \nwith different stocks or competencies or assets and because different managers have \nidentified different ways in which they can compete in the industry\u201d (Bogner, 1991, p. 496). \nBogner studied strategic group dynamics and examined various hypotheses as to why firms \nchange their grouping and under what circumstances.  \n \nUsing a methodology similar to previous research (Cool, 1985, Fiegenbaum, 1987, Martens, \n1988) and two distinct sets of analysis, Bogner showed that patterns certainly exist, but that \nthe underlying nature of these patterns was not consistent with what had been assumed to \nunderlie strategic group structures and their dynamics. Using paired questions, he first \nexplored the extent to which strategic groups reflected past performance and whether \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 13\nstrategic groups could be used to accurately predict future market position. He then \nconsidered the effect of the environment using a similar set of paired questions, one reflecting \npast responses and the other future actions. He concluded that strategic groups are not simply \ncognitive creations but are derived from artefacts of strategic intent, resource allocations and \nproduct introductions. Strategic groups are based upon managers\u2019 decisions based on \nindividual firm performance and objectives and not on some group homogeneity. \n \nIn a second set of questions Bogner explored whether firms change groups at times of \nenvironmental turbulence, something predicted by mobility barrier theory because barriers \nare likely to be lowered in a state of flux. Contrary to expectation, firms were found to move \nat all times and the changes were not driven by a single environmental opportunity. Results \nthat agree with those of a more recent study into evolutionary moves within the Spanish \nbanking industry which concluded \u201cthat at some point in time, almost any industry should \nshow some firms moving each year when the total number of firms that compose the industry \nis considered \u2026 and that individual firms will move across strategic groups in response to \nnew environmental circumstances without excessive difficulties\u201d (Zuniga-Vicente et al., \n2004). \n \nThese results are consistent with a less deterministic view of strategic group theory and \nstands in stark contrast especially to the conclusions from traditional IO. In particular they \nchallenge the widely held belief that strategic groups are differentially impacted by changes \nwithin the environment. Bogner concluded that the factors that led managers to move their \nfirms out of a grouping are unrelated in time or focus to the occasional disruptions in the \npattern of competition within the industry at large. He also concluded that a firm\u2019s ability to \nmove is not wholly constrained by environmental or mobility barriers, whether during a \nstable strategic time period or at a break between SSTPs. Mobility barriers are discussed in \nterms of the result of internal choices within firms not in terms of uncontrollable external \nevents.  \n \nBogner argued that firms adjust their competitive position based on benchmarking within \ntheir competitive group. Economically profitable firms are ones that have the flexibility to act \non changes in perception, manage to acquire appropriate assets, and change their competitive \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 14\npostures accordingly. If a firm is not performing to group standards, the reference position, \nthen proactive choices can be made to improve competitiveness. His notion of the \ncompetitive group adds to the idea of strategic choice. Bogner\u2019s study supports the \nproposition that mobility barriers are not something in the environment imposed upon the \nfirm but result from the firm\u2019s own actions. \n \nFinally, Bogner tested the proposition that performance will consistently vary between \ngroups. He found no support for the proposition; a result broadly consistent with that of Cool \nand Martens (Cool, 1985, Martens, 1988) earlier. This conclusion suggests that while the \nexternal phenomenon observed by Hunt (Hunt, 1972) is valid, Hunt\u2019s underlying causation of \nthe dynamics of strategic groups is not supported. Bogner concluded that strategic groups \nmeasure similarities in the different strategies that firm\u2019s employ, but that the way in which a \nfirm chooses to compete does not ultimately determine how effectively a firm competes. Thus \nintra-group differences may outweigh inter-group differences, a conclusion also consistent \nwith an observation of Cool (Cool, 1985).  \n \nAnother approach that blossomed briefly in the 1990s was an approach to strategic groups \nbased on the pioneering work of Hannan and Freeman  (Hannan and Freeman, 1977) on the \npopulation ecology of organizations. This evolutionary view of strategy led to strategic \ngroups considered as equivalent to species. In 1991 Boeker in a study of the US brewing \nindustry applied a population ecology perspective to derive strategic groups (Boeker, 1991) \nand this was followed in 1992 by a study from Carroll and Swaminathan, also on US brewing \n(Carroll and Swaminathan, 1992). These studies argued that strategic groups should be \nidentified in terms of organizational form rather than perceived strategies, which can be \nnormative in nature. In this analysis, organizational form encompasses not only the formal \norganizational structure but also \u2018all factors that define a population\u2019s niche, including \nespecially environmental factors\u2019 (Carroll and Swaminathan, 1992, p.68). In other words, the \nenvironment, very broadly defined, determines the performance of firms. The result is a \ndeterministic approach to strategic groups under which the scope for independent managerial \ndecision making is severely constrained. Unsurprisingly, most researchers find such a strictly \nexogenous view of the formation and continuation of strategic groups unattractive. \n \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 15\n \nAppraising Strategic Group Theory Against Alternative Classification Schemes \n \nThe discussion so far has highlighted the richness of strategic group theory, as well as its \nweaknesses and some inconsistencies. But a discussion of the development of strategic group \ntheory alone cannot provide a conclusive comment on its value for future management \nresearch. To go further we need to establish the desirable characteristics of a strategy \nclassification scheme for research and assess obvious alternatives to that offered by strategic \ngroup theory.  \n \nArguably, a strategy classification system should comprise the following characteristics to \nprovide a useful basis for management research and practice: \n1. Provide a meaningful classification of strategies employed within an industry \nrecognized by managers within that industry as valid. \n2. Allow competitive dynamics over time to be effectively measured and evolutionary \npathways traced. \n3. Permit flexibility in the use of a wide range of different strategies utilizing both \nquantitative data and qualitative and \u201cperceptual\u201d information. \n4. Enable a fine grained analysis of strategies within an industry, allowing a detailed and \nmeaningful classification based on multiple possible groupings rather than a highly \nrestricted set. \n5. To be readily accessible to and useable by managers. \n \nTwo obvious alternative strategy classifications to strategic groups for research in strategic \nmanagement are Porter\u2019s \u201cgeneric strategies\u201d and the Miles and Snow\u2019s \u201ctypologies\u201d. We \nnow discuss each in turn and with reference to the UK pharmaceuticals industry, which is the \nsubject of the mapping later in the paper and our on-going research, and compare their merits \nto strategic group theory. The aim is to establish whether strategic group theory offers a \nsuperior strategy classification based on the five characteristics above. \n \nPorter\u2019s approach to generic strategies plots companies along two simple dimensions, the \nbreadth of their product\/market offering against the choice of selling on price as \u201clowest cost \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 16\nproducer\u201d or differentiating on product benefits or other added value. Porter thus offers four \nbroad positioning alternatives, broad market vs. focus and low cost vs. differentiation. The \nadvantage of the generic strategies approach lies in its simplicity and comparative ease of \napplication. All of the data necessary to populate the model are readily available. The \nprinciple weakness of generic strategies is that it represents a blunt and crude measure to \nidentify and portray subtle patterns of strategic choice. It does not allow the sophisticated \nseparation of different but broadly similar strategic choices. \n \nIn the pharmaceutical industry, for example, a primary driver is the supply of new products. \nBut Porter\u2019s classification does not allow for the separation of companies employing an \nextensive licensing strategy, for example as pursued by the company Wyeth, as against a \nstrategy based primarily upon researching own compounds, as adopted, for instance, by \nMerck. It must also be recognized that research costs are a significant mobility barrier in the \nindustry. Pharmaceutical companies are forced by the economics of the research process to \nemploy a differentiated marketing approach targeted at the broadest market possible to \nrecoup their research costs before patent expiry. Therefore, while the product\/market \ndimension has some value within this industry, the differentiated vs. low cost dimension is \ntoo blunt to provide significant explanatory power. Porter\u2019s generic strategies may, however, \nbe perceived as supra groupings into which different sets of strategic groups may fit; a \nconclusion hinted at by Porter: \u201cThe three generic strategies represent three broad and \nconsistent approaches to successful strategic positioning \u2026. They are different broad types of \nstrategic groups that can be successful depending on the economics of the particular \nindustry\u201d(Porter, 1980, p 152). In other words, strategic group theory provides the potentially \nfine grained analysis in which the concept of generic strategic can be nested. \n \nThe Miles and Snow typology (Miles and Snow, 1978) differentiates firms into four \ngroupings - defender, prospector, analyzer and reactor. Again two key dimensions are used to \nseparate firms, namely breadth of product\/market domain, a dimension also chosen by Porter, \nand the degree of environmental uncertainty. The nub of Miles and Snow\u2019s argument hinges \non three points. First, that managerial or strategic choice represents the primary link between \nan organization and its environment. Second, that management\u2019s ability to understand and \nmanage the organization\u2019s interaction with its environment is the key to success. Third, that a \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 17\nprimary distinguishing factor between organization types is the multiple ways that \nmanagement responds to environmental cues. In essence, the Miles and Snow typology \nbroadly classifies firms into three discernable strategic types and reactors, which arguably \nrepresents a catch all category representing no clear strategy and equivalent to Porter\u2019s \u201cstuck \nin the middle\u201d. The primary variables used to classify firms and position them along the two \ndimensions are product\/market domain, growth engine, technology, planning, structure, \ncontrol, performance appraisal and co-ordination. Clearly, the last five of these variables are \nall \u201cinternal\u201d to the firm and effectively invisible to the external observer and therefore to \napply Miles and Snow\u2019s typology in research requires the gathering of perceptual \ninformation. This brings with it the attendant problems of distinguishing between realized \nand intended strategy and the mapping of evolutionary changes is also rendered problematic. \nThus, while Miles and Snow\u2019s classification allows the consideration of a number of \nvariables, the taxonomy presents a number of problems with regard to data gathering, ease of \napplication and interpretation. \n \nIn contrast, the strategic group taxonomy, we believe, offers a more flexible, transparent and \nmeaningful method to classify, compare and contrast firms by their strategies than that \noffered by \u2018generic strategies\u2019 or by Miles and Snow. It permits both sophisticated \nmathematical analysis of relationships and simpler analysis using strategic mapping. Strategic \ngroup analysis can encompass both quantitative and qualitative variables. Table 1 provides a \ncomparison of the different typologies according to the earlier five characteristics of a useful \nstrategy classification scheme, namely meaningfulness to managers, ability to map the \nevolution of the dynamics of the industry, data flexibility, sensitivity to multiple groupings \nand accessibility to managers. While all three approaches \u2013 generic strategies, Miles and \nSnow and strategic groups \u2013 can be meaningful to managers, strategic group theory offers \nadvantages over one or other of the alternatives with regards to the other desirable \ncharacteristics. \n \n \nINSERT TABLE NUMBER 1 \nABOUT HERE \n \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 18\nThe earlier review of strategic group theory since the 1970s identified the different ways in \nwhich the concept of the strategic group had developed as a tool for determining competitive \nperformance, at least in part due to differences in the way in which the concept had been \noperationalized. Simplistic cause-effect relationships derived from the IO literature, and \nespecially on the role of mobility barriers, had given way by the 1990s to the study of more \ncomplex relationships, in which strategic decision making both shapes and is shaped by \nstrategic groupings and in which managerial cognition is important. The result was a richer \ntheory of strategic groups; but since the early 1990s the emphasis in strategic management \nresearch has laid more in resource-base theories of the firm, including the study of core \ncompetencies, than strategic groups per se. Nevertheless, our conclusion is that the concept \nstill has considerable potential in strategic management research provided it is used with care. \nWe now illustrate its value through a strategic mapping of the UK pharmaceutical industry.  \nThis mapping forms the basis of our current research into the application of strategic group \ntheory. \n \n \nAn Application of Strategic Group Theory: the UK Pharmaceutical Industry \n \nStrategic group maps allow managers and researchers to develop a classification of strategy \nconducted in their industry. Also, through comparing maps at different time periods, the \ncompetitive dynamics and evolution of an industry may be better understood. Moreover, the \npatterns of strategic behaviour present within the industry can be identified and may be of \nvalue in predicting future company moves. Finally, identification of \u201creference companies\u201d \n(Bogner, 1991, Fiegenbaum and Thomas, 1995, McNamara et al., 2003) within strategic \ngroups simplifies competitor analysis, as group members may generally be expected to invest \nin similar ways to and follow the strategies of  the lead company within the group. Our \nstrategic mapping exercise below is based on detailed research into the UK pharmaceuticals \nindustry drawing upon company reports, web sites, published industry appraisals, interviews \nand the direct experience of one of the authors, who was until recently a senior manager in \nUK pharmaceuticals. The mapping emphasises the importance of intra as inter-group \ndynamics and particularly the role of mobility barriers, strategic group stability, and \nmanagement cognition and management decisions based on individual performance and \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 19\nobjectives. In other words, the mapping is a product of the developments in strategic group \nresearch reviewed above and provides a synthesis of the different approaches to strategic \ngroup theory. It uses two key strategic drivers in pharmaceuticals as axes.  In constructing a \nstrategic group map, Porter (1980, p.152) has suggested that \u201cthe best strategic variables to \nuse as axes are those that determine the key mobility barriers\u201d.  \n \nThe importance of research and development within the pharmaceutical industry has been \ncited by many authorities (Redwood, 1988, Corstjens, 1991, Taggart, 1993, Agrawal, 1999). \nThe cost of research activity generally constitutes equivalent to 15% to 20% of total revenues \nin the industry and is a major mobility barrier both into the industry and within the industry \nbetween different markets and different market segments. The cost is correlated with the \nnumber of therapeutic areas or \u201cbody systems\u201d, for example respiratory or gastrointestinal, \nwhich are actively researched and maintained to \u201cworld class\u201d standards. One obvious axis \nfor a strategic group mapping of the UK pharmaceuticals industry is therefore \u201cactive \ntherapeutic areas\u201d. \n \nWith the cost of research and development of each new chemical entity in the order of  \n$800m (Hawthorne, 2003) and patent expiry a critical competitive watershed, the importance \nof building a market presence rapidly has increased the role of an effective sales force to  \nbuild prescription share and differentiate products from the available alternatives. Sales force \n\u201cdetailing\u201d costs, for many companies are the greatest operating expense, with the cost of \nsales and marketing frequently in the order of 30% of total revenues. The term detailing is \none used in the pharmaceutical industry to describe calls on doctors to explain the features \nand benefits of a product. A second obvious axis for a strategic group mapping of the UK \npharmaceutical industry is therefore the number of details or sales calls, where sales-force \nsize acts as an effective mobility barrier in three main ways. First, the investment required \nlimits field force size for many companies. Second, fielding a large sales force acts to \ndifferentiate a product from the competition and provides a barrier that competitors must \novercome. Third, mopping up available doctor appointments effectively excludes the \ncompetition from the opportunity to compete. In effect, all pharmaceutical companies \ncompete for available time with the doctor, which is a finite resource. \n \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 20\nThe use of a bubble chart offers the opportunity to introduce a third variable to separate \ncompanies - \u201cleadership\u201d. Leadership, as measured by a dominant sales position within a \ngiven therapeutic area, acts in our mapping as a proxy for two important strategic dimensions, \nnamely technological leadership and relative price. Technological leadership within the \npharmaceutical industry is generally associated with being first to market, where the initial \nentrant has the opportunity to establish a dominant market share. The company\u2019s price \nposition tends also to be strongly associated with market entry because the UK profit and \nprice regulation scheme (PPRS) under National Health Service (NHS) regulations only \nallows the company to agree a price at point of entry. Subsequently, no price rises for the \nsame product are allowed. This results in UK pharmaceutical companies generally adopting \none of two pricing strategies, which are illustrated in Table 2. The first entrant sets the ceiling \nprice for that type of product, which is then either adopted by the next entrant (i.e. a strategy \nof price parity) or the new entrant may attempt to gain share through offering similar benefits \nat a discount (i.e. a price discount strategy).  For example, in the table Losec was the first \nanti-ulcer drug, introduced in 1989, and later competing products were priced at a discount. \nIn contrast, for anti-depressants Seroxat was priced at parity with the first product, Prozac, \nintroduced two years earlier, although the later entrants price discounted. For cholestoral \nlowering drugs there are examples of both parity and discounting pricing strategies.  \n \nINSERT  \nTABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \n  \nA strategic map for the current UK pharmaceutical industry, drawing on the above discussion \nof axes and variables is provided in Figure 1, where twelve strategic groups are identified. In \nthe mapping exercise the greater the size of the circles, the larger the number of areas in which \na company has therapeutic leadership. Overlapping circles indicate that the companies within a \nstrategic group have similar configurations of detailing activity and therapeutic areas served. \nTable 3 provides details on the number of therapy areas, the sales force activity incurred \npresented as thousands of details, and leadership as used in the mapping exercise. It also \nprovides a summary of which companies fall in which of the strategic groups in the mapping. \nThe positions are discussed in more detail below. The data used in the analysis were drawn \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 21\nfrom the combined British Pharmaceutical Industry and Hospital Audits together with data \nfrom the UK Promotional Audit and were based on the databases of IMS Health. IMS Health is \nthe leading provider of market information to the UK Pharmaceutical Industry.  \n \nINSERT FIGURE 1 & TABLE 3  \nABOUT HERE \n \nGroup A consists of the companies Lundbeck and Servier. These companies are both of \nEuropean origin and both focus their attention upon one area of therapeutic medicine. \nBoth companies spend a substantial amount on sales force but are not overall \ntherapeutic leaders. Use of Porter\u2019s generic strategies (Porter, 1980) would classify \nthese companies as pursuing a focused differentiated strategy. \n \nGroup B is interesting in that it includes all of the Japanese companies within the \nindustry, i.e. Sankyo, Takeda, Yamanouchi, Eisai, Ajinomoto, and Fujisawa, together \nwith two recent European entrants, Menarini and Orion. Of these it is worthy of note \nthat Sankyo and Yamanouchi entered the UK market via acquisition acquiring Pan \nPharma and Brocades respectively, in contrast to the other recent entrants all of whom \nhave established their position organically. The only surprise in this group is Reckitt \nBenckiser an industrial company that is the world number 1 in household cleaning but \nhas a small pharmaceutical division. This group appears to encompass virtually all the \nindustry new entrants in recent years, who appear to have adopted a similar focused \nentry strategy based upon no more than two therapeutic areas and supported by a \nmoderate-sized sales force.  \n \nGroup C comprises Mundi Pharma and Elan, both US drug delivery companies, \ntogether with UCB Pharma, a niche speciality pharmaceutical company engaged in \nresearch and development in the fields of allergic\/respiratory diseases and disorders of \nthe central nervous system. All three companies are pursuing a focused differentiation \nstrategy based upon a limited number of therapy areas. \n \nGroup D includes Ferring and Schering AG both niche pharmaceutical companies \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 22\ntogether with 3M, Procter and Gamble and Solvay.  These are all large diversified \nindustrial companies with limited pharmaceutical operations. All are focused upon four \ntherapeutic areas and employ relatively small sales forces. The exception is Ferring, \nwhich does not employ a conventional detailing force. \n \nGroup E encompasses Leo laboratories, a Danish company specialising in \npharmaceuticals and animal health, Merck KGAA, which is a German pharmaceutical \ncompany with a strong interest in generics, Ivax, a US branded generic manufacturer, \nand Baxter, a US company specialising in hospital products. This group is somewhat of \na hybrid hence the dotted line on the mapping and includes a number of companies that \nappear diverse, with both Merck KGAA and Ivax marketing generic products. \n \nGroup F includes Bayer and Lilly both companies that have recently experienced strong \nmarket changes, Bayer with the withdrawal of its main product Lipobay and Lilly that \nlost 90% of its revenues from Prozac following patent expiry. The third company, Shire \nPharmaceuticals, recently underwent dramatic changes following the removal of its \nchief executive. There is evidence from our research that all three companies have \nreduced their promotional expenditure whilst considering their options. \n \nGroup G comprises Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb and Johnson and \nJohnson. All field good sized sales forces and support a broad and not wholly congruent \nrange of products both to the retail and hospital markets. All three companies derive \nbetween 20% and 30% of revenue from sales to hospitals. \n \nGroup H consists solely of Roche, a company engaged in a number of healthcare related \nbusinesses and that grew both organically and as a result of merger. Roche derives 40% \nof its revenues from the hospital market and fields a number of specialised sales teams \nrather than the large, mainly GP oriented, field forces typical of rival companies of a \nsimilar size. Roche employs a differentiated strategy aimed at a broad section of the \nmarket. \n \nGroup I occupies the middle ground within the UK pharmaceutical industry. The \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 23\ncompanies within this strategic group include Abbott, Astra Zeneca, Sanofi Synthelabo, \nSchering Plough and Wyeth. All of these companies derive more than 85% of their \nrevenues from the retail pharmaceutical market. All, and particularly Astra Zeneca, \nWyeth and Schering Plough, are known for strongly targeted, aggressively driven sales \nforces, which concentrate upon general practitioners. All with the exception of Schering \nPlough have grown in part through merger or acquisition and all are pure \npharmaceutical companies. Sanofi Synthelabo and Novartis are the only members of \nthis group with an interest in generic medicines. These companies sell through high \ncontact coverage of their targeted customer group and operate a broadly differentiated \nstrategy. \n \nGroup J includes Merck Sharp and Dohme together with Pfizer. These two companies \nhave a lot in common. They are both US based pharmaceutical companies renowned for \nlarge and high coverage contact sales forces, high spending on research and \ndevelopment, and they derive more than 90% of their revenues from the retail market. \nSupport for this positioning appears in a recent book on Merck, which cites the \ncompany\u2019s executives as saying that Pfizer is their number one competitor (Hawthorne, \n2003). \n \nGroup K companies span a broad range of therapeutic areas and derive up to 30% of \ntheir revenues from sales to hospitals. All of these companies are the result of serial \nmergers and all face the problem of sustaining their present size given declining \nindustry research and development productivity.  Given the number of therapeutic areas \nthat they are involved in, they all have large numbers of differently focused sales teams \nto support and invest heavily in both product promotion and research. Their strategy, \ntherefore, is very much broad market and differentiated. \n \nGroup L companies appears to be stuck in the middle. Goldshield is a branded generic \nmanufacturer and relies largely on telesales to sell its products to retail chemists and \nhospital pharmacies rather than via doctors. The company faces strong competition \nfrom generic manufacturers with a lower cost base. Celltech is a biotechnology \ncompany that has been around a long time but which has yet to produce a significant \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 24\nproduct. The company has grown through acquisition and derives the bulk of its sales \nfrom products acquired from Medeva, one of its acquisitions. It is not apparent that \neither of these companies has a clear positioning and the share prices of both companies \nhave suffered recently. To denote this somewhat hybrid group it is surrounded by a \nrectangular dotted line. \n \nThis example of a strategic mapping based on the UK pharmaceutical industry illustrates a \nnumber of the potential benefits from undertaking a strategic group analysis. Application of \nthe method enables an overview of the industry to be presented, differentiating between firms \nand groupings, and provides evidence of a good deal of congruence within the strategic \ngroups identified; for example, the inclusion of Merck and Pfizer together, the grouping \ntogether of all of the Japanese entrants, and the inclusion within group K of companies that \nhave participated in serial mergers. The results strongly support the argument that strategic \ngroup analysis can provide a useful taxonomy of industry strategies. At the same time, the \nanalysis raises interesting research questions; for example, why have no Japanese companies \nadopted a more aggressive sales stance given the size of their parent companies; have their \nparents forced them to grow organically? Such questions can form the basis for a successful \ncompetitor analysis to improve strategy formulation and implementation. Our analysis \nsuggests, therefore, that the strategic group mapping provides a useful basis for research on \nstrategies in the UK pharmaceutical industry. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nStrategic group theory developed from the early 1970s based on analysing structural \nimpediments that protect industry positions and profits from erosion by preventing free \nmovement of firms within an industry. The emphasis in strategic management research in the \n1990s on resources and competences, along with the growing diversity in approaches to \ndefining strategic groups in strategic group theory in the 1980s, led to some neglect of the \nsubject in more recent times. There has been \u2018Much uncertainty about the importance, or \neven the existence, of strategic groups\u2019 (Warren, 2002, p. 196). \n \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 25\nThe argument in this paper is that strategic group theory still provides a useful approach for \nmanagement research.  This has been illustrated by comparison with two obvious alternatives \nin strategic management research \u2013 Porter\u2019s generic strategies and Miles and Snow\u2019s \nclassification of strategic positioning \u2013 and through the development of a strategic mapping \nof the current UK pharmaceutical industry. The paper has detailed the main developments in \nstrategic group theory and has contrasted the various approaches adopted. The result today is \na rich research vein rather than a worn out seam.  Strategic group theory provides a means for \nmanagers and researchers to aggregate firms into groups employing similar strategies to \npermit a better understanding of the competitive dynamics of an industry and its evolution. In \nterms of future research, strategic group theory would undoubtedly benefit from more \ndirectly comparable, industry-specific studies, with a more careful focus on variable selection \nand the statistical methods used for validation. As we have noted, some earlier research \nappears to have deficiencies both in terms of the variables used and in an over-simplistic use \nof cluster analysis. Future studies should aim to build sets of industry specific variables that \ndescribe strategic choice within that industry and the statistical methods used to identify \nstrategic groupings need to be robust to ensure that strategic groups are not solely an artefact \nof method. This is the focus of our continuing research into strategic group theory and its \napplication in the UK pharmaceuticals industry. \n \n \n \nStrategic Group Theory: review, examination and application in the UK \npharmaceutical industry. \n \n  \n \n \n 26\n Table 1: \n \n \nComparing the Characteristics of Alternative Strategy Typologies \n \n \n \n \nTypology Meaningful \nto Managers \nAble to Map \nEvolution \nDynamics \nFlexible to \nstrategy \nmeasures \nand data \nSources \nAllows \nmultiple \ngroupings \nReadily \nAccessible to \nManagers  \n      \nPorter \n\u201cGeneric \nStrategies\u201d \nYes No Yes Low Yes \nMiles & \nSnow \nYes No No Low No \nStrategic \nGroups \nYes Yes Yes High Yes \n      \nTable 2: \n \n \nPricing Strategy in the UK Pharmaceutical Industry \n \nMARKET PRODUCT COMPANY INTRODUCED PRICE Relative Price \n      \nAnti-ulcer \ndrugs Losec Astra 1989 28.56 1.00 \n Zoton Wyeth 1994 23.75 0.83 \n Protium Abbott 1996 23.65 0.83 \n Pariet Eisai 1998 22.75 0.80 \n      \nCholesterol \nlowering  \ndrugs Zocor MSD 1989 29.69 1.00 \n Lescol Novartis 1994 12.72 0.43 \n Lipostat BMS 1996 29.69 1.00 \n Lipitor Pfizer 1997 29.69 1.00 \n Lipobay Bayer 1997 17.35 0.58 \n      \nAnti-\ndepressants Prozac Lilly 1989 16.58 1.00 \n Seroxat GSK 1991 16.58 1.00 \n Efexor Wyeth 1995 11.99 0.72 \n Lustral Pfizer 1996 16.2 0.98 \n      \n \n \nNote: prices lower than 1.0 indicate use of a price discount strategy.\n  Table 3: \n \nStrategic Groups in the UK Pharmaceutical Industry \n \n \nNumber of \ntherapeutic \nareas \nserved \n \n \nAnnual \ndetailing units \n(000\u2019s) \nNumber of \nleadership \npositions \nin \ntherapeutic \nareas \nStrategic \ngroup in \nwhich the \ncompany \nis located \nin the \nmapping \nSERVIER 1.00 109.3 0 A \nLUNDBECK 1.00 124.6 0 A \nSANKYO 1.00 28.6 0 B \nAJINOMOTO 2.00 0.6 0 B \nFUJISAWA 2.00 1.7 0 B \nRECKITT 2.00 19.5 0 B \nORION 2.00 26.5 0 B \nEISAI 2.00 28.8 0 B \nMENARINI 2.00 38.4 0 B \nYAMANOUCHI 2.00 65.3 0 B \nTAKEDA 2.00 79.6 0 B \nELAN 3.00 14.5 0 C \nUCB PHARMA 3.00 51.5 0 C \nMUNDI PHARMA 3.00 72.4 0 C \nFERRING 4.00 0.0 0 D \n3M 4.00 21.6 0 D \nPROCTER  4.00 31.1 0 D \nNOVO NORDISK 4.00 31.7 0 D \nSCHERING AG 4.00 48.9 0 D \nSOLVAY 4.00 66.0 0 D \nBAXTER 5.00 0.0 0 E \nIVAX 5.00 27.8 0 E \nAKZO NOBEL 5.00 51.5 0 E \nLEO 5.00 61.8 1.00 E \nMERCK KGAA 6.00 25.6 0 E \nBAYER 7.00 9.9 0 F \nSHIRE 7.00 32.6 0 F \nLILLY 7.00 67.2 0 F \nBOEHRINGER ING 8.00 83.0 0 G \nBMS 9.00 51.1 0 G \nJOHNSON & J 9.00 51.3 0 G \nROCHE 13.00 68.7 1.00 H \nASTRA ZENECA 7.00 233.2 1.00 I \nSCHERING PL 9.00 137.0 0 I \nSANOFI SYNTH 9.00 171.8 1.00 I \nABBOTT 9.00 176.9 0.
