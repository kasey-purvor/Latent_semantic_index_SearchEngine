Subsurface coal mining, shipbuilding, \ntextile and paper as well as engineering industries have all had a significant \nenvironmental impact on sediments quality of the urban area of Glasgow (Edgar et al., \n1999; Edgar et al., 2003; Hume, 1974). Although heavy industry on the banks of the \nRiver Clyde declined from 1950s-1970s and shipbuilding ended in 1971 Glasgow \nremains a thriving city with much of the infrastructure necessary to maintain a modern \nmixed economy such as power stations, oil refineries, landfill sites and sewage works \nlocated in close proximity to the main channel and tributaries. The aim of this study \nwas to determine individual concentrations of three important groups of pollutants \nnamely, parent polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) \nand organotins in surface sediments of the Inner Clyde Estuary. \n \nSediments were collected between October and February 2003 at 11 sites using a \nstainless steel Van Veen grab. An aliquot of each (~500 g) sediment was freeze-dried \nand sieved through a mesh aperture of 2 mm. Total organic carbon (TOC) content was \ndetermined using Elementar VarioMax C, N analyser after acidification with HCl (50 \n% v\/v) to remove carbonate. The limits of quantification reported for a typical 300mg \nsample were 0.18%. \n \nFor PAH extraction, 0.5g sieved sediment was weighed into a amber bottle and 25 mL \nof 50\/50 v\/v HPLC grade acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was added. After \nbrief swirling the contents were sonicated (Camlab, 300W) for 45 minutes at 50\u00b0C. \nThe capped bottle was then stored (ca. 2 hours) in the dark before taking a 1 mL \naliquot of the supernatant in a gas-tight glass syringe, attaching a 0.45 \u03bcm in-line \nsyringe filter (Nylon 66), and injecting into a 5 \u0002L sample loop on the HPLC (Waters \n600E). A Hypersil\u00aePAH column (100 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.) with guard was employed \nfor PAH separation. Gradient elution at 1 mL\/min was initiated with a 50\/50 mix of  \ngradient HPLC grade acetonitrile (Rathburn Ltd.) and HPLC grade water (Milli-Q) \nmaintained for 5 minutes. Thereafter, up to 27 minutes, the proportion of acetonitrile \nwas linearly increased from 50% to 100%. From 27 minutes until the end of the run \n(40 mins.) elution with 100% acetonitrile was maintained. PAH detection was \nachieved with a programmable fluorescence detector (Waters 474). Quality control \nwas accomplished by subjecting a low-level PAH reference material (LGC 6188 \u2013 \nRiver Sediment) to the above procedure. A total of four QC (LGC 6188) runs were \nconducted at intervals throughout the analysis of the samples.  Limits of detection are \npresented in Table 2. \n \nThe method used to extract and determine PCB concentrations was based on that by \nAyris et al., (1997) and has been described by Vane et al., (2007). Combined gas \nchromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed on a Fisons 8000 GC \ndirectly coupled to Fisons MD-800 single-quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in \nfull scan mode (ionization energy 70 eV, mass range 39-600 amu). Sample \napplication (1 \u0002l) was by on-column injection, the GC was fitted with a fused silica \nZB-5 column (60 m length x 0.32 mm i.d. x 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness). The GC oven \nwas temperature-programmed from 100\u00b0C (1 min. isothermal) to 200\u00b0C (at 5\u00b0C \/ \nmin.) to 280\u00b0C (at 2.4\u00b0C \/ min.) to 320\u00b0C (at 20\u00b0C \/ min.) and held isothermally at \n320\u00b0C for 5 min and helium was used as carrier gas at 16 p.s.i. The limit of detection \n(LOD) based on the minimum concentrations that gave clearly defined peaks was \nbetween 0.1-0.20 \u0002g\/kg. Quality control was achieved by subjecting a PCB certified \nreference material (LGC 6113\u2013Soil) to the above procedure and analysing it by the \nsame method as for the samples. \n \nTributyltin, (TBT), was prepared for analysis using a method described by \u0003obi\u0004ski et\nal, 1992. Organotin compounds were analysed using a Fisons MD 800 mass \nspectrometer operated in full scan mode (m\/z: 39-600), with electron impact and \nquadrupole analyser. On-column injection was onto a DB-1 column (60m length x \n0.32 mm i.d. x 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness). Oven temperature programme: 60\u00b0C (1 min. \nisothermal) to 320\u00b0C (at 10\u00b0C \/ min.) and isothermal at 320\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Carrier \ngas: helium at 16 p.s.i. The limit of detection = 0.15 \u03bcg as Sn\/g dry weight.\n \nThe chromatographically determined concentrations of the 15 PAHs appear in Table \n2. Total PAH concentrations in the samples were found to range between 630 \u0002g\/kg to \n23711 \u0002g\/kg.  This range broadly concurs with that from a recent study of UK \nestuarine PAH where sediments from the Clyde estuary ranged from 450 \u0002g\/kg to \n41781 \u0002g\/kg for the summed concentrations of 22 PAHs and from 229 \u0002g\/kg to 28851 \n\u0002g\/kg for the 4-6 ring members (Rogers, 2002).  It is also comparable with those of \nother estuaries whose environments are highly industrialised and where similar \nactivities to those in the Clyde region occur, e.g. River Tyne (260 \u0002g\/kg to 43470 \n\u0002g\/kg); River Wear (205 \u0002g\/kg to 31715 \u0002g\/kg); River Tees (653 \u0002g\/kg to 26549 \n\u0002g\/kg) for the summed concentrations of 15 USEPA PAHs (Woodhead et al., 1999).   \nThere was some correlation (r2 = 0.56) between the TOC and the total PAH \nconcentration of the sediments as depicted in Figure 2.  It was found that the organic \nmatter content (TOC), and hence the total PAH concentration, roughly corresponded \nwith sample type as shown in Table 2.  It can be observed that the coarser sediments \n(sands and gravels) had the lowest TOCs (0.31% - 2.72%) and correspondingly the \nlowest PAH concentrations (630 \u0002g\/kg - 2615 \u0002g\/kg).  All the sediments described as \nblack muds had much higher TOCs (3.98% - 6.15%) and in turn a much higher range \nof total PAH (11701 \u0002g\/kg - 23711 \u0002g\/kg).   \nPAHs are of global ubiquity and reside in the environment mainly as a result of their  \nproduction during fossil fuel combustion.  This major pyrolitic contribution is \ncharacterized by the preponderance of eight high molecular weight PAHs (McCready \net al., 2000): \nFluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, \nbenzo[a]pyrene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene and indeno[1,2,3-c,d] pyrene \nPhenanthrene, the most thermodynamically stable of the 3-ringed PAHs, may be \nprominent also, although if it is present in large amounts, i.e. so that the \nphenanthrene:anthracene ratio is greater than 10, then this may be indicative of a \npetrogenic origin (Budzinski et al., 1997).  The relative abundance of the PAHs in the \nsediments were tabulated such that the eight high molecular weight pyrolitic PAHs \ntogether with phenanthrene were ranked in order of their prevalence (Table 3).  It can \nbe noted that there are few divergences from the nine pyrolitic PAHs being \nexclusively the predominant species.  The most significant of these divergences are \nfor Stations 3 (Upper Harbour) and 8 (Yoker Burn).  The Yoker Burn sample \npossessed appreciable amounts of naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene and \nanthracene such that these 2- and 3- ringed species were ranked as more abundant \nthan benzo[g,h,i]perylene.  Their presence was indicative of a proportionally greater \npetrogenic contribution to the total PAHs. Yoker Burn is in proximity to an oil \nrefinery.  It seems likely, therefore, that the local industrial pyrolitic PAH output may \nalso be augmented by petrogenic PAH from possible fuel spills and leakages.  For \nUpper Harbour the presence of low molecular weight PAHs, in addition to the nine \npyrolitic members, probably stems from incomplete combustion of vehicle fuels, it \nbeing a general urban area close to the centre of Glasgow. \nAnother approach for the ascription of petrogenic\/pyrolitic PAH origin is the use of \nmolecular indices criteria based on isomeric ratios (Readman et al., 2002).  The \ncriteria arise from thermodynamic considerations of the behaviour of pairs of PAH \nisomers.  For instance phenanthrene is more thermodynamically stable than its isomer \nanthracene.  Accordingly, the phenanthrene: anthracene ratio is found to be \ntemperature dependent.  At low temperature, (e.g. the slow thermal maturation of \norganic matter in petroleum), the phen.\/anth. ratio is high (50 at 100\u00b0C) but at higher \ntemperatures, (e.g. the combustion of fossil fuels), it is much lower (4 to 10).  The \ncriteria of  phen.\/anth. >10 for petrogenic and <10 for pyrolitic inputs emerges.  It \nmust be borne in mind that this is not rigorous and borderline values need to be \ntreated with caution.  For example, phen.\/anth. ratios <15 usually relate to incomplete \ncombustion of organic matter, yet the analysis of some petroleum products, can \nproduce ratios as low as 4 to 10 for gas-oils and ca. 14 for crude oils before \ncombustion (Budzinski et al., 1997).  Similar logic may be applied to the fluor.\/pyr. \nratio, where values >1 are classically related to pyrolitic origins, but again there are \nexceptions.  A combination of these two ratios graphically provides more reliable \nestimate of PAH source (Baumard et al., 1998).  The ratio of another pair of isomers, \ni.e. benz(a)anth.\/chrys. has also been used to provide the criteria:  >0.9 (pyrolitic) and \n\u0005 0.4 (petrogenic) with the same caveat of caution, particularly in the intermediate \nzone (Gschwend and Hites, 1981).  Yet another pair of isomers can be used in the \nform of the ratio of indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene to indeno(1,2,3-cd) pyrene plus \nbenzo(ghi)perylene.  The criteria that emerge are that if this ratio is <0.2 a petroleum \nsource is indicated, 0.2 to 0.5 implies liquid fossil fuel (vehicle and crude oil) \ncombustion, and ratios >0.5 betoken coal, grass or wood combustion (Yunker et al., \n2002)  \nTable 7 presents the molecular indices for the sediments.  It will be observed that all \nthe phen\/anth. ratios are <10;  the two highest correspond to Dalmarnock Road Bridge \n(6.89) and Yoker Burn (5.96) where the possibility of a petrogenic input has already \nbeen discussed.  This view is reinforced for the former by its fanth.\/pyr. ratio which is \n0.84.  If the benz(a)anth.\/chrys. ratio criteria are applied then a pyrolitic origin would \nhave to be ascribed to all the sediments. All except three samples fall in the range 0.2 \nto 0.5 when the isomers indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and benzo(ghi)perylene are \nconsidered, implying that the pyrolitic source for the region is primarily liquid fossil \nfuel combustion.  The three samples falling outside the range are all >0.5 probably \nindicating a coal-burning contribution to their PAH distribution. \nPlotting the phen.\/anth. ratio against the fanth.\/pyr. ratio gives the plot that appears in \nFigure 3. It can be seen from this that all but one of the sediments plot within the \npyrolitic quadrant of the graph with the remaining one, Dalmarnock Road Bridge, \nbeing in close proximity to the borderlines of this quadrant.  No sample plotted in the \npetrogenic quadrant.  Essentially the information provided by the graph supports the \nconclusions arrived at from consideration of the PAH distribution bar charts as \nexpressed in Table 6. \n \nThe concentrations of individual congeners (ICES 7 group), summed tetra-, penta-, \nhexa-, heptachlorinated congeners and total PCBs as well as TOC data are presented \nin Table 4. The mean average total PCB content of the 11 stations was 46.9 \u0002g\/kg and \nall sampling sites showed some degree of PCB contamination. Total PCB \nconcentration ranged from 5.2 \u0002g\/kg  (station 3, Upper Harbour) to 129.9 \u0002g\/kg  \n(station 6, Merklands) (Table 4). This range is consistent with findings of a recent \nstudy of the PCBs where sediments from the Clyde Estuary area were reported to \nhave values of 0.5 \u0002g\/kg to 66 \u0002g\/kg for the summed concentrations of 22 \nchlorobiphenyl congeners with the exception of one contaminant hot spot in the \nvicinity of Battery Park (1,822 \u0002g\/kg ) Greenock Clyde (Edgar et al., 1999; Edgar et \nal., 2003; Edgar et al., 2006). In this current work the sediment stations showing the \nhighest concentrations of PCBs were numbers 4 (lower harbour) 99.96 \u0002g\/kg, 6 \n(Merklands) 129.89 \u0002g\/kg and 7 (King George V. Dock) 95 \u0002g\/kg  located in close \ngeographical proximity to the most urbanised and active zones of industrial activity in \nGlasgow (Fig. 1; Table 4) (Hume, 1974). In contrast the sediment stations in the \nvicinity of less historically urbanised or industrialised areas such as stations 1 \n(Cunningar) 15.48 \u0002g\/kg , 2 (Dalmarnock Rd. Rail Bridge) 31.35 \u0002g\/kg , 10 (Erskine) \n13.25 \u0002g\/kg  and 11 Milton 12.45 \u0002g\/kg  had lower total PCB concentrations. This is \nsupported by previous work in the Clyde by PCB concentrations of Otter (Lutra lutra) \nfaeces collected from rural portions of the Upper River Clyde had nine times lower \nPCB concentrations than the more urbanised portions Lower River Clyde (Mason et \nal., 1992). Overall the mean PCB value of 46.9 \u0002g\/kg in this current work is \nsomewhat lower than those reported for other U.K. Estuaries with comparable \nindustrial histories such as the Mersey Estuary which has a mean PCB content of 123 \n\u0002g\/kg  (Vane et al., 2007). The relationship between higher PCB concentrations and a \nparticular industrial location is however rather loose, for example Yoker Burn located \nnear to an oil refinery gave a total PCB concentration of 19.35 \u0002g\/kg which is lower \nthan the mean value determined for all the surface sediments. \n \nThe relative proportions of PCBs were broadly similar and independent of total \nconcentration with the main components of the PCB mixtures being comprised of \ntetra, penta and hexa-chlorinated homologues with lower percentages of tri and hepta-\nchlorinated PCB moieties (Table 4). Their distribution is partly indicative of the \nprecursor industrial mixtures such as Arcolor 1254, which is comprised of tetra-, \npenta- and hexa-chlorinated biphenyls. No systematic change in PCB homologue \npercentages was observed from station 1 at Cunningar down stream to station 11 to \nMilton (Figure 1). The average homologue distribution for stations 1 to 11 are \npresented in Fig 4, in this respect the percentage of trichlorinated congeners (11 %) is \nhigher than that previously reported for the Clyde Estuary by Edgar et al., (1999). \nHowever the proportions of tetra, penta, hexa (24-31 %) in this current work are \ncomparable with the tetra, penta, hexa chlorinated congeners (21-30%) previously \nreported. This similarity suggests that the sources of PCB contamination in the Clyde \nEstuary has remained unchanged over the past ten years. \n \nAlthough PCB contamination of all of the Clyde Estuary sites was demonstrable, the \nrisk to estuarine ecosystems and human health is more difficult to evaluate since the \nmost immediate concerns are raised when residue levels in the food chain increase \nabove concentrations harmful to human health. Numerical soil quality guidelines \n(SQG) for marine and fresh water ecosystems represent one method to asses sediment \nquality using criteria which evaluate whether a contaminant may cause adverse effects \non sediment dwelling organisms (MacDonald et al., 2000). Consensus based \nthreshold effect concentrations (TEC) and probable effect concentrations (PEC) \nprovide a means of classifying sediments as toxic or non-toxic, these have been \nreported for total PCB concentrations in freshwater sediments as 59.8 \u0002g\/kg and 676 \n\u0002g\/kg respectively (MacDonald et al., 2000). On this basis, seven sites (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \n10, 11) fall below total PCB TEC where as three sediment stations namely Lower \nHarbour, Merklands and King George V. Dock (4, 6, 7) fell between TEC and PEC; \noverall the PCB concentrations encountered in the 11 surface sediments are probably \nnot having an adverse effect on sediment-dwelling organisms. \n \nTributyltin concentrations from 11 sample stations of the inner Clyde Estuary are \npresented in Table 5. Tributyltin concentrations ranged from 0.41-0.61 \u03bcg (as Sn)\/g \ndry wt, however the TBT concentration presented here are 4 to 8 times higher than \nthose reported for other major U.K. estuaries such as the Mersey (0.007-0.173 \u03bcg\/g) \nand Thames (0.002-0.078 \u03bcg\/g) but are lower than the TBT concentrations of up to \n213 \u03bcg\/g observed at Poole Harbour U.K. (Langston et al., 2005; Langston et al., \n1987). One plausible explanation for the higher values reported in this work as \ncompared to Thames and Mersey Estuaries could due to the fact that sample stations 3 \nand 7 are in close proximity to Upper Harbour and King George V Dock which would \nhave organotin contamination input from the marine paint applied to hulls of boats \nand shipping. \n \nThis survey of PAH, PCB and TBT concentrations in surface sediments of the Inner \nClyde Estuary provide a baseline to underpin process driven research and monitoring \nin this heavily industrialised region of the U.K. \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors are indebted to the crews of the SEPA Research Vessel \u2018Endrick I\u2019 and \nthe Glasgow Humane Society vessel as well as all BGS staff involved in sample \ncollection.
