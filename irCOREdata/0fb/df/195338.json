It has been observed that \nin addition to being interesting atmospheric occurrences \nfrom the meteorological perspective, evaporation ducts \nhave far reaching implications on radio communications \nover the sea and in coastal regions (e.g. ship to ship and ship \nto shore communications). They are of particular impor- \ntance at the extreme limits of propagation and allow radio \nwaves to propagate beyond the horizon. Over the years, \nmuch research has been undertaken to explain the mecha- \nnism of radiowave propagation in evaporation ducts. \nBackground Theory \nThe lowest part of the earth's atmosphere is called the tropo- \nsphere. Typically, the troposphere extends from the surface of the \nearth to an altitude of approximately 9 km at the poles and 17 km \nat the equator [1]. This upper boundary is referred to as the \ntropopause and is defined as the point at which the temperature in \nthe atmosphere begins to increase with height. Within the \ntroposphere, the temperature is found to decrease with altitude \nat a rate of approximately 7 ~ C per kilometre [1,2]. The earth's \nweather system is confined to the troposphere and the fluctua- \ntions in weather parameters like temperature, pressure and \nhumidity cause the refractive index of the air in this layer to vary \nfrom one point to another. It is in this context that the tropo- \nsphere assumes a vital role in the propagation of radiowaves at \nAll the authors are in the \nDepartment of Engineering, \nUniversity of Leicester, UK. \nSD Gunashekar is doing his \nPhD.

The \nmeteorological conditions therefore influence the manner in \nwhich radiowave propagation occurs in the troposphere both on \na spatial and temporal scale. \nRefractive Index, Refractivity and Modified Refrac- \ntivity \nIn general, the refractive index, n, of the troposphere decreases \nwith altitude [2,3,4]. To simplify the mathematics involved \nvariations in the horizontal are neglected and horizontal homo- \ngeneity of the refractive index of the troposphere is assumed in \nmost discussions on this topic. A typical value for n at sea level is \n1.000350. A few metres above sea level, this might decrease to a \nvalue such as 1.000300. For all practical purposes, at this scale, \nthis change in the refractive index is negligibly small, with \nhardly any visible deviation. However, immediately above the \nsurface of the sea, it is often this small (but rapid) change in the \nrefractive index profile that facilitates the formation of meteoro- \nlogical phenomena c lled evaporat\/on ducts. \nA convenient way of expressing these unwieldy numbers is to \nuse the concept of refract\/v\/ty instead. Refractivity, N, is defined \nas follows [2,3]: \nN = (n-1)*10 s (1) \nSo, for example, when n = 1.000350, N = 350. \nA well-known approximation for refractivity N is given below \n[2, 3, 4]: \nN= P~ T ' \nKeywords \nEvaporation duct, troposphere, \nradiowave propagation. \nwhere P = total atmospheric pressure (in mb); \n\f9 T = atmospheric temperature (in K); \ne = water vapour pressure (in mb). \nAll three terms, P, T and e have been observed to fall with height \n52 RESONANCE I January 2006 \nGENERAL J ARTICLE \nin an exponential manner, resulting in a corresponding decrease \nin N with height [2,4]. A standard atmosphere, therefore isone in \nwhich the refractivity varies with altitude according to equation \n(1). Using Snelrs law, a radio ray projected into the atmosphere \nwill have to travel from a denser to rarer medium and will refract \ndownwards towards the surface of the earth. The curvature of \nthe ray, however, will still be less than the earth's curvature. The \ngradient of refractivity in this case generally varies from 0 to -79 \nN-units per kilometre [2]. When the refractivity gradient varies \nfrom -79 to -157 N-units per kilometre, asuparefractive condi- \ntion is said to prevail in the troposphere and the ray will refract \ndownwards at a rate greater than standard but less than the \ncurvature of the earth [2]. A refractivity gradient that is even less \nthan -157 N-units per kilometre will result in a ray that refracts \ntowards the earth's surface with a curvature that exceeds the \ncurvature of the earth [2]. This situation is referred to as trapping \nand is of particular importance in the context of evaporation \nducts. Finally, if the refractivity gradient is greater than 0 N- \nunits per kilometre, asubrefiactiw condition exists and a radio \nray will now refract upwards, away from the surface of the earth \n[2]. Depending on the existing conditions in the troposphere, a \nradio wave will undergo any of the types of refraction: \nsubrefraction, standard refraction, superrefraction r trapping. \nFigure 1 illustrates the four refractive conditions discussed above. \nFigure 1.

To account for drawing radio rays as \nstraight lines, we must therefore increase the radius of the earth. \nThe radius of this virtual sphere is known as the effective earth \nradius and it is approximately equal to four-thirds the true radius \nof the earth (i.e. roughly 8500 kin) [2,3]. \nA more classical form of representing n is that of modified \nrefractivity, M. In this case, the surface of the earth is repre- \nsented by a fiat plane and the radio rays are constituted by curves \nthat are determined by Snelrs law and the corresponding value \nof M at each point along the radio link. The following is the \nexpression for M [1,5]: \n= N + 0.157h, (4) \nwhere N -- refractivity (in N-units), \nh = height above sea level (in metres) \na = radius of the earth (in metres). \nTheory of Evaporation Ducts \nFormation of Eeaporation Ducts \nThe air that is in immediate contact with the sea surface is \nsaturated with water vapour (i.e. the relative humidity is 100%). \nAs the height increases, the water vapour pressure in the atmo- \nsphere rapidly decreases until it reaches an ambient value at \nwhich it remains more or less static for a further increase in \nheight. Therefore, for the first few metres above the surface of \nthe sea, it is the water vapour pressure, e, in the expression for N \nthat dominates. This rapid decrease in e causes asteep fall in N. \nThis is reflected in the modified refractivity, M, which also \ncorrespondingly decreases. (The height erm h, which increases, \nis more than offset by the rapidly decreasing N term). This \nbehaviour can be clearly observed in the following graph ofh vs. \nRESONANCE J January 2006 \nGENERAL t ARTICLE \nh \nsea surface.~. . .~ \nRegion of the troposphere \nEvaporation dominated by a rapid \nduct height ~ decrease in humidity \nM \nM (Figure 2) as that portion of the curve with a strong negativeM \ngradient. Therefore, despite the fact that the height h is increas- \ning, it is the sharp fall in the water vapour pressure, e that \ncontributes to the rapid decrease in M. \nOnce e has reached its ambient value at a given height, afurther \nrise in altitude does not cause a substantial change in the humid- \nity of the troposphere. Thus, as h increases further, N decreases \nmore (since air pressure and temperature both decrease with \nheight). But this decrease in N is very small over large height \nincrements. Consequently, despite adecreasing N term, it is the \nh term that starts to dominate in the expression for M. Thus, M \nnow gradually increases with height, and can be seen as the \nportion of the curve that has a positive M gradient. \nFigure 2. Modified refrac- \ntivity profile of the tropo- \nsphere above the surface \nof the sea indicating the \npresence of an evaporation \nduct. \nThe point at which the M gradient changes from negative to \npositive is referred to as the evaporation duct height (or thickness), \nand is a practical and realistic measure of the strength of the \nevaporation duct. \nEvaporation Ducts and the Troposphere \nBy virtue of their nature of formation, evaporation ducts are \nnearly permanent features over the sea surface. Typically, the \nheight of an evaporation duct is of the order of only a few metres; \nhowever, this can vary considerably with geographical location \nRESONANCE I January 2006 5,5 \nGENERAL ] ARTICLE \nand changes in atmospheric parameters such as humidity, air \npressure and temperature. In the lower regions of the tropo- \nsphere where the earth's weather is confined, these parameters \ndo, in fact, fluctuate significantly. The turbulent nature of the \natmosphere contributes to its unpredictability and a variable \natmosphere, in turn, is one of the major causes of unreliable \nwireless communications. \nDepending on their location and the prevailing climate, evapo- \nration duct heights may vary from a few metres to few tens of \nmetres. The world average duct height has been reported to be \n13m. Also, tropical climates are more favourable than temperate \nclimates for the formation of evaporation ducts [6]. Addition- \nally, it has been observed that calm sea conditions are more \nconducive for the creation of ducts. As a consequence of sporadic \nmeteorological phenomena, evaporation duct heights undergo \nsignificant spatial and temporal variations. \nEvaporation ducts are weather-related phenomena; their heights \ncannot easily be measured irectly using instruments like re- \nfractometers and radiosondes. At best, the height of an evapora- \ntion duct can be deduced from the bulk meteorological param- \neters that are representative of the ongoing physical processes at \nthe air-sea boundary. The dependence of evaporation ducts on \nthe physical structure of the troposphere signifies that changing \nweather conditions can indeed result in alterations in radio wave \npropagation. \nEvaporation Ducts and Radio~oave Propagation \nOver the years, much research as been undertaken to explain \nthe mechanism of radiowave propagation i evaporation ducts. \nA key reason why evaporation ducts are so important for radio \ncommunications is because they are often associated with en- \nhanced signal strengths at receivers. \nAn evaporation duct can be regarded as a natural waveguide that \nsteers the radio signal from the transmitter toa receiver that may \nbe situated well beyond the radio horizon [1, 4, 5]. The drop in \nRESONANCE J January 2006 \nGENERAL I ARTICLE \nRADIO SIGNAL WITH ONE SEA SURFACE \nREFLECTION AND TWO TOP-OF-DUCT REFLECTIONS \nRADIO SIGNAL WITH A SINGLE TOP-OF-DUCT \nREFLECTION \nLEAKA%OF ENERGY \n\/ ~ TOPOF \n_I __~____.~__~. ~ EVAPORATION DUCT \nv ANTENNA ANTENNA \nthe refractive index of the atmosphere within the first few metres \nabove the surface of the sea causes incident radio waves to be \nrefracted towards the earth more than normal so that their \nradius of curvature becomes less than or equal to that of the \nearth's urface. The sudden change in the atmosphere's refrac- \ntivity at the top of the duct causes the radio waves to refract back \ninto the duct, and when it comes in contact with the surface of \nthe sea, it gets reflected upwards again. The waves then propa- \ngate long ranges by means of successive r flections (refractions) \nfrom the top of the duct and the surface of the earth (Figure 3). \nIt is worth mentioning here that since the top of an evaporation \nduct is not 'solid' (as in the case of an actual waveguide), there \nwill be a small but finite amount of energy leakage into the free \nspace immediately above the duct (Figure 3). However, despite \nthis escape of energy, radio waves are still capable of travelling \ngreat distances through the duct, with relatively small attenua- \ntion and path loss. \nIt must be remembered that this is a very simplistic and one- \ndimensional means of illustrating radiowave propagation in \nevaporation ducts, one that is based on the assumption that the \natmosphere's refractive index is horizontally homogeneous. \nFigure 3. Diagram illustrat- \ning evaporation ductpropa- \ngation. \nRESONANCE J January 2006 57 \nGENERAL I ARTICLE \nAs mentioned previously, this ducting effect often results in \nradio signals reaching places that are beyond the radio horizon \nwith improved signal strengths. This naturally has far reaching \nimplications on practical radio propagation patterns. For this \nreason, evaporation ducts and their impact on radio wave propa- \ngation have been studied extensively over the years. Numerous \nstatistical models have been proposed to describe vaporation \nducts and compute the duct heights under different atmospheric \nconditions [5]. \nThe presence of evaporation ducts might not always indicate \nenhanced signal strengths. For instance, if there is an unwanted \ndistant ransmitter also located within the duct, then there is \nalways the possibility of the system under consideration being \nsusceptible to signal interference and interception. This, of \ncourse, is dependent on the location of the radio paths being \ninvestigated. Another scenario that might arise is the interfer- \nence between the various propagation modes that exist within \nthe evaporation duct itself. Depending on the separation of the \ntransmitter and receiver and the prevailing atmospheric condi- \ntions, there could be destructive interference between the direct \nand reflected rays, the latter of which is comprised of the various \nmultiple hop (one-hop, two-hop, and so on) propagation modes \n(Figure 3). Additionally, signal degradation may also occur if \nthere is destructive interference between various modes that \narrive at the receiver after refraction from different heights in \nthe troposphere. All these situations could possibly cause key \nproblems in the domain of cellular mobile communication sys- \ntems in littoral regions. Thus, in addition to aiding radiowave \npropagation, evaporation ducts could also be principal limiting \nfactors in beyond line of sight over-the-sea UHF propagation. \nMarine Boundary Layer Processes \nIt is a well-established fact that the occurrence of evaporation \nducts over the open sea is highly dependent on the various \nphysical processes and interactions that exist at the air-sea bound- \nary\/ayer [1,5]. It has been proposed that the difference in tern- \nRESONANCE J January 2006 \nGENERAL J ARTICLE \nperature between the sea and the air in immediate contact with \nthe sea is a significant contributing factor in the formation of \nevaporation ducts. This temperature difference is referred to as \nthe air-sea temperature difference (ASTD). When this quantity is \npositive, that is, when the air temperature is higher than the sea \ntemperature, we have a stable atmospheric condition. This is be- \ncause colder air (in direct contact with the cold ocean) remains \nbeneath the warmer ising air, thus preventing convection cur- \nrents from arising. On the other hand, when the air temperature \nis somewhat less than the sea temperature, an unstable condition is \nsaid to prevail. Such a situation tends to occur when the warmer \nair (in immediate contact with the warm ocean) begins to rise \nabove the cold sinking air, thereby resulting in a convective \nmotion. Meteorological observations reveal that in the open \nocean, unstable conditions are more likely to exist. \nPractical Results: Enhanced Signal Propagation in \nthe British Channel Islands due to Ducting \nThis section contains graphical outputs and statistical results \nusing experimental data to clearly verify the theory and conclu- \nsions that have been presented. The various results have been \nobtained from a research experiment being conducted in the \nBritish Channel Islands by the Radio Systems Research Group, \nDepartment ofEngineering, University of Leicester, UK. Spe- \ncifically, a number of scatter plots have been produced that ry to \nexplain the correlation between enhanced signal strength occur- \nrences and specific meteorological conditions in the English \nChannel along a 50 kilometre transhorizon UHF radio link \n(Jersey to Alderney). \nIn general, the sea temperature is a few degrees above the air \ntemperature, flecting the prevalent unstable atmospheric con- \nditions in the open sea. However, there are periods when the air \ntemperature exceeds the sea temperature (Figure 4a). Enhanced \nsignal strengths were observed uring most of these periods \n(Figure 4b). The plots reveal that for enhanced propagation to \noccur, the following conditions must both be satisfied: \nRESONANCE J January 2006 59 \nGENERAL I ARTICLE \nFigure 4.
