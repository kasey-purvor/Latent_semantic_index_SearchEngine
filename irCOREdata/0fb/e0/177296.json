This randomised controlled trial compared the \neffectiveness of SH with rubber band ligation (RBL) in the treatment of grade II \ncircumferential symptomatic haemorrhoids in the long-term.  \nPatients and Methods: A consecutive cohort of patients were randomly allocated \nto either SH or RBL. Data on haemorrhoidal symptoms, Cleveland continence \nscores, sphincter assessment, SF-36, EQ-5D, HAD score and prior treatment \nhistory were assessed at enrollment and reassessed by long-term postal \nquestionnaire. The details were analysed using SPSS\uf6db 12.0 from Microsoft\uf6db \nAccess\uf8e8. \nResults: Sixty patients were allocated by computer block randomisation. Both \ngroups were balanced for age, sex and symptoms. Recurrence was significant, \nfavoring SH [3 vs 11; OR 0.18, 95% CI (0.03 to 0.86), p=0.028] at one year and, at \na mean of 40.67 (31-47) months [4 vs. 12; OR 0.23, 95% CI (0.05, 0.95); \np=0.039]. SH patients experienced prolonged pain [Median (IQR) = 7 (5,7) vs. 3 \n(1,7), P=0.008] and took longer time to return to work [6 (3,7) vs. 3 (1,6) days, \nP=0.018].  No significant difference in quality of life.   \n \nConclusion: SH achieved better disease control at one year without any major \ncomplication.  This was sustained in the long-term. Further studies with greater \nnumber of patients are needed to confirm this small study.  \n \n \n \nIntroduction \nThere is a plethora of treatments available for haemorrhoids but no single \nconventional modality combines immediate efficacy, sustained benefit, patient \nacceptability and a low complication rate. Rubber band ligation (RBL) is a \ncommonly used, simple and out patient procedure. It is easily repeatable with \nbetter results compared to other non-operative treatments including injection \nsclerotherapy, cryotherapy, and infrared coagulation1. In spite of its simple nature \nRBL may be associated with a variety of complications including vaso-vagal \nsyncope, severe pain, urinary retention, bleeding and more rarely with perineal \nand retroperitoneal sepsis, as well as recurrence of symptoms.\n \n2-5 \nIf outpatient measures fail, the most commonly performed operative procedure is \nexcisional haemorrhoidectomy6. This removes the haemorrhoidal tissue, unlike \nRBL, which aims to reduce prolapse with retention of the anal cushion by \nproducing sub mucosal fibrosis at its apex. We recently undertook a systematic \nreview comparing these two treatments which demonstrated that EH was a more \neffective method of successfully treating grade III haemorrhoids7\n \n. This was \nappeared to be achieved at the expense of an increased risk of procedure-related \npotential complications.. No evidence of a statistically significant difference was \nseen in grade II haemorrhoids.  \nImproved understanding of the pathogenesis of haemorrhoids8, increasing belief in \nthe importance of preserving the anal cushions and greater awareness of the \ncomplications associated with excisional haemorrhoidectomy lead to the invention \nof newer surgical procedures including stapled haemorrhoidopexy (SH). SH acts \nby relocating the haemorrhoidal cushions cranially into their original position by \nexcising a strip of lower rectal mucosa (pain insensitive mucosa) and by \ninterrupting the blood supply to the haemorrhoids9.   \nA variety of studies have proved the efficacy and safety of SH compared with \nother treatment modalities (RBL, Excisional Haemorrhoidectomy)10-15. Most \npublished comparative trials of SH have evaluated the new procedure against \nexcisional haemorrhoidectomy. The fundamental difference in the mechanisms of \naction of these two procedures limits the validity of such a comparison. Since the \nintroduction of SH there has been only one published randomised controlled trial \ncomparing this procedure with RBL in the treatment of grade III and IV \nhaemorrhoids.10 In view of the relatively high recurrence rate for symptoms \nfollowing RBL16,17\n \n (frequently adopted for grade II haemorrhoids) and the lack of \ncomparative studies against SH, we conducted a pilot study to compare these two \ntechniques in a randomised controlled setting.  \nAims \nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of SH against conventional \ntherapy (RBL) in the treatment of circumferential grade II haemorrhoids. All the \npatients included in the trial were symptomatic and keen for an intervention to \nallay the symptoms.  \n \nPatients and methods \nThis was a single centre, prospective, pragmatic, open, randomised controlled trial \nwith parallel group design, comparing RBL with SH in symptomatic, \ncircumferential (haemorrhoids in all the three primary positions with or without \nadditional secondary haemorrhoids), prolapsing haemorrhoids that reduce \nspontaneously (grade II) or requiring only occasional manual reduction. The \nprimary outcome addressed in this study was disease recurrence at one year and \nthe cumulative costs to the NHS. Both subjective and objective evidence of \ndisease recurrence were considered before making a conclusion that any \nparticular patient had recurrent disease needing further treatment. This study was \nconducted as a pilot study and hence no power calculation performed. Additional \noutcome measures included quality of life [assessed by Short Form-36 (SF-36)18, \nEuroQuol -5D (EQ-5D19) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD score)], \nQuality Adjusted Life Years (QUALY), symptom score20, time to no pain, time to \nnormal activity, patient satisfaction, effect on ano-rectal physiology and \ncomplication rates between the two procedures. A visual analogue scale (VAS) 21\n \n \nwas used to assess the severity of pain before and for seven days after the \nprocedure. The Grampian local research ethics committee approved the conduct \nof the study (Ethics committee approval code \u2013 GREC 01\/0297). Further long-term \nfollow-up was obtained by a postal questionnaire and case notes review (where \nthe questionnaire was not returned).  \nInclusion criteria: The study included a consecutive group of patients with \nsymptomatic grade II haemorrhoids recruited between October 2002 and March \n2004 without regard for age, sex or duration of symptoms. This cohort included \nsymptomatic patients who had previously undergone non-operative treatment for \nhaemorrhoids with at least 6 months elapsing prior to recruitment.   \n \nExclusion criteria: Patients with peri-anal sepsis and malignant disease of the \nlarge bowel were excluded from the trial. Similarly, those with pre-existing \nevidence of sphincter injury were also excluded after appropriate investigations.  \n \nPre-treatment assessment: All trial participants underwent a standardised pre-\noperative evaluation of anal sphincter function by an endo-anal ultrasound and \nanal manometry. This assessment was performed prior to randomisation in order \nto facilitate the exclusion of patients with anatomical or functional defects of the \nsphincters. Then, the participants were randomised to one or other of the two \ninterventions.  \n \nRandomisation: A computerised block randomisation technique was utilised in \nthis study. The Health Science Research Unit (HSRU), University of Aberdeen, \ncreated a computer program to generate a sequence of treatment allocations by \nblock randomisation using a random number generator. Investigators were blinded \nto the block size to avoid selection bias. Allocation to treatment was performed on \nthe day of the procedure using HSRUs secure automated telephone \nrandomisation service.  \n \nRBL was performed using the standard suction banding technique. All three \nhaemorrhoidal components were treated at one sitting. This was performed in the \noperating theatre but with out anaesthesia. SH was performed using the \nProcedure for Prolapse and Haemorrhoids 01 (PPHTM, Ethicon Endo-Surgery\u00ae \nplc, Europe) kit. The patients were placed in prone jack-knife position as this was \nthe routine practice of the surgeon. The procedural details are published \nelsewhere12,14\n \n. \nPost-procedure evaluation:  Time to no pain and time to return to normal activity \nwere recorded for all participants. All the pre-operative data were collected after \neach procedure at 6-weeks, 6-months and 1-year after each procedure \nProctoscopic examination was carried out at each stage of follow-up to identify \nrecurrent disease. Patients who remained symptomatic after intervention could be \nre-treated within the trial protocol. RBL could be attempted four further times, 6-\nweeks apart, and SH patients could undergo two further stapling procedure before \nbeing classified into a complete treatment failure group.    \n \nAn independent consultant colorectal surgeon, who was blinded to the \nintervention, performed the final follow-up assessment at 52 weeks. The disease \nwas considered recurrent if there were both subjective and objective evidence of \nrecurrent disease. \n \nStatistical Analysis \nEach comparison was analysed by intention to treat. The outcomes were analysed \nonly after the completion of data collection from the final patient at the end of one \nyear. Statistical significance for all outcomes was based on the two-sided t-test \nwith p \u2264 0.05. Recurrence was compared using a two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test. \nThe distribution of the numbers of days to no pain and return to normal activities \nwere skewed and thus analysed using a Mann-Whitney U test. For health-related \nquality of life measures and all other outcomes, the mean difference between \nintervention groups adjusting for baseline values, was estimated using a linear \nregression model. For the long-term follow-up, Mann-Whitney U test for the \nCleveland and symptom score were performed. All analyses were carried out \nusing SPSS\uf8e8 \n \n12.0 for Windows\uf6db and STATA version 9.0.   \n \n  \nResults \nOf the sixty-nine patients identified with grade II symptomatic circumferential \nhaemorrhoids, between October 2002 and March 2004, sixty patients were \nrecruited into the study (Fig. 1). There were forty-four male patients. The median \nage was 44 (range 22 to 71) years. The commonest symptom at presentation was \nbleeding (n=56). Details of other haemorrhoidal symptoms were also obtained \n(Table 1).  Reasonable balance was observed at baseline between the two \ntreatment groups (Table 2). \n \nAll 60 participants received the treatment to which they were allocated. Data for \nthree patients in each group was missing at the one-year follow-up for a variety of \nreasons (one patient in the RBL group withdrew before the 3-week follow-up; \nanother patient in the stapled group developed Crohn\u2019s disease of the small bowel \nand withdrew after the 6-week follow-up; an additional two patients in each group \nmoved out of the area after the 6-month follow-up).  \n \nAt the 3-week follow-up there was evidence of a lower SF-36 physical component \nscore [mean (SD) 47 (7) versus 52 (9); mean difference: -3.5, 95% CI (-7.1 to 0.1); \np=0.054], for SH. This was not observed for the mental component score [mean \n(SD) 47 (10) versus 49 (10); mean difference: 0.3, 95% CI (-3.6 to 4.2); p=0.883]. \nSimilarly, no statistically significant difference was seen with the EQ-5D [mean \n(SD), 0.7 (0.3) versus 0.8 (0.2); mean difference: 0.0, 95% CI (-0.1 to 0.1); \np=0.665] at 3-weeks.  \n \nOne patient in the stapled group and 10 in the RBL group had recurrence of \nhaemorrhoidal disease at 6-weeks. At one year, there was evidence of a lower \nrate of recurrence of haemorrhoidal disease in the SH group compared to RBL [3 \nvs. 11; OR 0.18 95% CI (0.03 to 0.86); p=0.028]. One patient in the stapled group \nreceived a single re-treatment during the trial period whereas 10 patients in the \nRBL group had one or more (19 in total) further band ligations. There was a trend \ntowards better overall symptom scores in the stapled group at the end of the \nfollow-up period (Table 3). Nevertheless, this did not achieve statistical difference \nbetween the two interventions.  \n \nA total of 46 out of 60 (77%) questionnaires (24 in SH and 22 in RBL group) were \nreturned.  Six patients had dropped out of the trial within the first year, for the \nreasons mentioned above. The case notes and hospital attendance record \n(electronic hospital database) were reviewed for the remaining 8 patients to \nassess if any further treatments had been performed after the one-year follow-up. \nThe mean (SD) length of follow-up was 40.67 (\u00b16.26) months. There was a \nstatistically significant difference in the disease recurrence favouring SH, 4 vs. 12; \nOR 0.22 95% CI (0.04, 0.92); p=0.035. However, the Cleveland score (mean (SD), \n3 (4) versus 3 (4); mean difference: 0.4, 95% CI (-1.8 to 2.7); p=0.686) and the \nsymptom score (mean (SD), 6 (5) versus 7 (5); mean difference: -1.0, 95% CI (-\n3.8 to 1.7); p=0.456) did not reveal any significant difference between the two \nprocedures. \n   \nTwo participants developed postoperative retention of urine following SH. One \npatient each had faecal impaction and a fissure-in-ano following SH. Both patients \nwere managed appropriately without further consequences. One other patient in \nthe stapled group suffered mild symptomatic anal stenosis, which was managed \nconservatively and did not require surgical intervention. Three more patients were \nfound to have residual staples at one year. There was no further bleeding in these \npatients once the staples were removed. Among the patients treated with RBL, \none patient developed a severe post-procedure anal fissure. This did not resolve \nwith medical treatment and required examination under anaesthesia and internal \nsphincterotomy. The Cleveland continence score did not reveal a significant \ndifference in continence between the procedures over either at 6-weeks [mean \ndifference: 0.8 95% CI (-1.6 to 3.5), p=0.166)] or at 52-weeks [mean difference: \n0.8 95% CI (-1.6 to 3.5), p=0.156)]. Moreover no statistically significant differences \nwere observed for any of the quality of life measures at one year (Table 3). One \npatient in the stapled group showed ultrasound evidence of minor damage to the \ninternal sphincter (this was not reflected on anal pressures or continence). There \nwas no other evidence of anatomical or functional damage to the internal or \nexternal anal sphincters on endo-anal ultrasound or manometry in either cohort. \n \nPain on the day of the procedure was similar for both groups, 5 (4, 8) vs. 6 (4, 8). \nHowever, patients took longer to become pain free after the SH procedure \n[median (IQR) - 7 (5,7) (n=30) vs. 3 (1,7) days (n=28); p=0.008] and to return to \nnormal activity compared with RBL [6 (3,7) vs. 3 (1,6) days; p=0.018] (Fig.2).   \n \nThe mean cost per patient treated using stapled haemorrhoidopexy was \nsignificantly higher than that for RBL (\u00a31620 compared to \u00a3252).  Much of this \ndifference can be attributed to the initial procedure cost. Based on the recurrence \nat 1-year, an incremental cost per recurrence avoided from stapling \nhaemorrhoidopexy was \u00a34560. It was unlikely that stapled haemorrhoidopexy \nwould be considered cost-effective at threshold values for society\u2019s willingness to \npay for a QALY based upon the 12 month data. However, given the finding of \nincreased recurrences in the rubber band ligation arm it would be expected that \nthe difference in cost would fall over a longer time horizon and that the quality of \nlife associated with the rubber band ligation arm would be reduced. The cost \neffective analysis of this comparative study will be presented in a separate paper.  \n. \nDiscussion: \nExcisional haemorrhoidectomy is considered the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for the surgical \ntreatment of prolapsing and symptomatic haemorrhoids. This procedure is widely \nperceived as painful with potential  complications22. Such considerations may alter \ntreatment-seeking attitude amongst patients, and in particular, may result in \nunder-reporting of recurrent or residual symptoms 23\n \n.   \nThe outcome from a variety of studies has shown SH to be equally effective \ncompared to excisional haemorrhoidectomy (EH) in the long term24. Initial \ncomparative trials involving excision versus stapled procedures have \ndemonstrated consistently reduced pain scores in favour of the stapled \nprocedure25-27\n \n. It can be argued that, as the surgical mechanisms involved in the \ntwo procedures are so widely different, such comparisons have limited validity.  \nThe intent and mechanism of SH is similar to that of RBL. The patient population \nwas selected in an attempt to get a clinically meaningful group in whom most \ncolorectal surgeons would consider RBL rather than immediate surgery. This \ngroup was also felt most likely to answer the question regarding the place, if any, \nof an earlier definitive treatment (albeit at greater initial expense) in modifying the \nnatural history of the disease. If, however, sustained efficacy can be \ndemonstrated, the reduced future costs of re-treatment may make this justifiable, \neven if intervention is carried out at an earlier pathological stage. Nevertheless, \nthere was greater post-procedure pain and a prolongation of time away from \nnormal activity in patients treated with SH. However both groups showed early \nreturn to normal activity (within one week) and compare favourably with historical \ntrials of excisional haemorrhoidectomy. \n \nThere are some early and delayed complications reported in the literature for \nSH28-30\n \n. No such major complications  were observed in our study in either group. \nMoreover, continued rectal bleeding experienced by some of the patients was \nactually due to residual staples rather than true recurrence of the disease. These \npatients were reassured and followed up after 6-weeks to identify any objective \nevidence of haemorrhoids. Hence, both independent consultant assessment and \nsymptoms from patients were considered before any patients were declared to \nhave recurrent disease needing further treatment.   \nA further concern with regard to SH has been the involvement of internal anal \nsphincter in the rectal doughnut specimen. However this does not appear to \ninfluence continence or anal symptoms in the long term.20,31 By evaluating \nsphincter anatomy and physiology, this study has again shown no adverse effect \nof either treatment modality. The power of the study was reflected in the \nconfidence intervals for the comparison. We cannot exclude the possibility of a \ndifference of up to 3.5 in the symptom score at 52 wk and 3.8 at long-term follow \nup. The retrospective power calculation was not performed because it was not \nconsidered good practice as they merely reflect the result \n(http:\/\/www.cs.uiowa.edu\/~rlenth\/Power\/).  \n \n \n  \n \nConclusion \nThe findings from previous studies of the effectiveness of SH in have been \nconfirmed in our study. SH had less recurrence at 1 year than RBL although it was \nassociated with a longer post-operative recovery.  The clinical benefit of SH is \nmaintained in the long-term. However, there is insufficient evidence about the \ncost-effectiveness of stapled haemorrhoidopexy for grade II haemorrhoids to \nrecommend its use in place of rubber band ligation. Additionally, in view of the \nnon-significant difference in the symptom score and because of the benign nature \nof the disease, it would be reasonable to perform RBL prior to considering the SH. \nA properly selected cohort of patients would benefit from the treatment with SH. \nThe patients should be allowed to make an informed choice considering the \nseverity and duration of symptoms. Further studies with greater number of \npatients need to be performed to substantiate the significant difference.  \n \n \nReferences: \n1. MacRae HM, Temple LKF, McLeod RS.

When relevant, \nhow the success of blinding was evaluated. \n9 \nStatistical \nmethods \n12 Statistical methods used to compare groups for \nprimary outcome(s); Methods for additional \nanalyses, such as subgroup analyses and adjusted \nanalyses. \n10 \nRESULTS \nParticipant flow \n \n13 Flow of participants through each stage (a diagram \nis strongly recommended). Specifically, for each \ngroup report the numbers of participants randomly \nassigned, receiving intended treatment, completing \n11,12,13 \nthe study protocol, and analyzed for the primary \noutcome. Describe protocol deviations from study as \nplanned, together with reasons. \nRecruitment 14 Dates defining the periods of recruitment and follow-\nup. \n11 \nBaseline data 15 Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of \neach group. \n11,25 \nNumbers \nanalyzed \n16 Number of participants (denominator) in each group \nincluded in each analysis and whether the analysis \nwas by \"intention-to-treat\".
