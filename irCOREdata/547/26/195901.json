Current treatments are either ineffective or carry unacceptable side effects for a number \nof patients; in consequence, development of new approaches to therapy are important.

Two channels of particular interest are the \nvoltage-gated K\n+\n channel Kv1.3 and the intermediate conductance Ca\n2+\n-activated K\n+\n channel \nKCa3.1 (also known as IKCa1 or SK4). Kv1.3 is expressed in IFN -producing T cells while KCa3.1 \nis expressed in T cells, mast cells, macrophages, airway smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and \nepithelial cells. Both channels play important roles in cell activation, migration and proliferation \nthrough the regulation of membrane potential and calcium signalling. We hypothesise that \nKCa3.1- and\/or Kv1.3-dependent cell processes are one of the common denominators in asthma \npathophysiology.

Further validation through the study of the \nrole these channels play in normal and asthmatic airway cell (patho)physiology and in vivo \nmodels will provide further justification for the assessment of small molecule blockers of Kv1.3 \nand KCa3.1 in the treatment of asthma. \n 3 \nAsthma pathophysiology \nAsthma affects 10% of westernised populations and is an important cause of morbidity and \nmortality at all ages (Asher et al., 2006; Masoli et al., 2004). It is a complex disease characterised \nby airway inflammation, airway wall remodelling and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). \nExactly how these three key features interact and whether they are dependent on each other for \ntheir occurrence remains unknown. There is continued debate about the most important cell type \nmediating the airway changes in asthma, but critical analysis of the current evidence indicates \nthat most if not all elements of the asthmatic airway are dysfunctional. There is epithelial \ndysfunction with failure of healing and overproduction of growth factors and pro-inflammatory \ncytokines (Holgate et al., 1999), mucous gland hyperplasia with associated mucus hypersecretion \n(Carroll et al., 2002), airway smooth muscle (ASM) dysfunction with resulting hypertrophy, \nhyperplasia, BHR and cytokine secretion (Ebina et al., 1990; Ebina et al., 1993; Brightling et al., \n2005), and inflammatory cell activation with \u201cover-active\u201d mast cells (Bradding et al., 2006), T \ncells (Robinson et al., 1992), eosinophils (Bradding et al., 1994) and neutrophils (Carroll et al., \n2002). The current cornerstone of asthma management is the use of inhaled corticosteroids which \nare efficacious in about 90% of patients (Barnes & Adcock, 2003). However, for approximately \n10% of patients steroids are of poor efficacy for reasons, which are not understood. These severe \nor refractory patients are difficult to treat, suffer great morbidity, and use up a disproportionate \nfraction of healthcare resources (Wenzel, 2005). Novel treatments for asthma targeting the \ninflammatory response are emerging, but to date these have been disappointing. An example is \nthe use of anti-TNF  strategies, which although promising in small pilot studies, have proved \nineffective in larger randomised controlled trials (Berry et al., 2006; Wenzel et al., 2009). Similar \ndisappointment has occurred with the use of anti-IL-4 (O'Byrne, 2006). There is therefore an \n 4 \nunmet clinical need for new asthma drugs with different mechanisms of action and\/or adverse-\neffect profiles. \n \nThe K\n+\n channels Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 as potential novel therapeutic targets for asthma \nCells such as muscle and nerves fire action potentials and are known as excitable cells. The role \nof ion channels in propagating these electrical impulses is well described. In contrast, cells which \ndo not have\/fire action potentials such as leukocytes are generally regarded as non-excitable cells. \nHowever, molecular biology and patch-clamp analyses in recent years have shown that non-\nexcitable cells such as lymphocytes express a complex mix of ion channels carrying K\n+\n, Cl\n-\n, Ca\n2+\n \nand non-selective combinations of cations (Bradding, 2005; Chandy et al., 2004). These channels \nare expressed at different levels depending on the cell subset and the state of activation and \ndifferentiation. Influx of extracellular Ca\n2+\n is an essential requirement for the activity of many \ncellular processes (Berridge et al., 2000). K\n+\n channels play an important role in Ca\n2+\n signalling \nthrough their ability to maintain a negative membrane potential during cell activation (Fanger et \nal., 2001; Ghanshani et al., 2000; Duffy et al., 2004), which enhances Ca\n2+\n influx through \ninward-rectifier Ca\n2+\n channels due to an increased electrical driving force for Ca\n2+\n entry (Hoth & \nPenner, 1992). For example in T cells (Fig. 1), the voltage-gated K\n+\n channel Kv1.3 and the Ca\n2+\n-\nactivated K\n+\n channel KCa3.1 regulate Ca\n2+\n-influx through the calcium-release activated Ca\n2+\n \n(CRAC) channel, which consists of the Ca\n2+\n-sensor STIM1 and the pore forming protein \nCRACM1 (Orai1) (Feske et al., 2006; Vig et al., 2006; Prakriya et al., 2006; Yeromin et al., \n2006; Lis et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2005). The Ca\n2+\n- influx results in the increase in cytosolic \nCa\n2+\n concentration necessary for the translocation of NFAT to the nucleus and the initiation of \nnew transcription ultimately resulting in cytokine secretion and T cell proliferation (Dolmetsch et \n 5 \nal., 1997; Dolmetsch et al., 1998; Lewis, 2001). However, this crucial influx of Ca\n2+\n is only \npossible if the T cell can keep its membrane potential negative by a counterbalancing K\n+\n efflux \nthrough Kv1.3 and\/or KCa3.1 (Lin et al., 1993; Chandy et al., 2004). Both channels are therefore \nregarded as attractive new targets for immunosuppression (Chandy et al., 2004). \n In addition to T cells, Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 are widely distributed amongst immune and \nstructural airway cells, where they play key roles in cellular activation, proliferation and \nmigration by regulating membrane potential and Ca\n2+\n signalling processes. We therefore \nhypothesise that KCa3.1- and\/or Kv1.3-dependent cell processes are one of the common \ndenominators in asthma pathophysiology. If true, these channels might serve as novel targets for \nthe treatment of asthma.  \n \nKv1.3 \nBoth Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 have a well-developed pharmacology and have been shown previously to \nbe amenable to drug therapy. Functional Kv1.3 channels are opened by membrane depolarisation, \nwith half maximal opening occurring at -40 mV to -35 mV (Cahalan et al., 1985; Grissmer et al., \n1990). With cell depolarization, a conformational change moves the voltage sensor in the S4 \ntransmembrane domain and opens the channel pore (Larsson et al., 1996). There are several \npotent and relatively selective inhibitors of Kv1.3. These include ShK (Kd 11 pM) a 35 amino \nacid polypeptide derived from the Caribbean Sea anenome Stichodactyla helianthus and \nmargatoxin (Kd 110 pM) derived from the scorpion Centruroides margaritatus (Chandy et al., \n2004). Both bind to the outer mouth of the channel and physically obstruct ion conduction. Once \nbound, their dissociation is very slow so that their effects may persist for several hours. The \nspecificity of ShK for Kv1.3 is greatly enhanced by the substitution of the critical Lys\n22\n in ShK \n 6 \nwith diaminopropionic acid (ShK-Dap\n22\n) (Kalman et al., 1998), or by attachment of L-\nphosphotyrosine to the N-terminus (ShK(L5)) (Beeton et al., 2005). These analogues are \nremarkably stable in cell culture systems and in vivo. PAP-1 (5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen) is \nthe first relatively specific small molecule blocker of Kv1.3 (Kd 2 nM) (Schmitz et al., 2005). A \nfurther useful tool for the study of Kv1.3 is a fluorescein-6-carboxylic acid (F6CA)-labelled \nanalogue of ShK. F6CA-ShK binds with high affinity to Kv1.3 channels and can be used to detect \nthem in T cells using flow cytometry (Beeton et al., 2003). \n \nKCa3.1 \nKCa3.1 channels have a similar topological structure to Kv1.3, but rather than containing a voltage \nsensor in the S4 domain, they bind calmodulin tightly near the C-terminus which serves as the \nCa\n2+\n sensor. KCa3.1 channels are thus opened by a rise in cytosolic free Ca\n2+\n ([Ca\n2+\n]i due to Ca\n2+\n-\ncalmodulin-mediated cross-linking of subunits in the channel tetramer (Fanger et al., 1999). \nChannel function is reported to be increased by membrane associated protein kinase A (PKA) \nthrough phosphorylation of either the channel protein itself or a closely associated accessory \nprotein in oocytes and T84 cells (Gerlach et al., 2000). In CD4\n+\n T cells, KCa3.1 activity is \nincreased by the nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDPK-B), which phosphorylates KCa3.1 on \nhistidine 358 (Srivastava et al., 2006). In contrast, histidine 358 is dephosphorylated by the \nmammalian protein histidine phosphatase (PHPT-1), which directly binds to the KCa3.1 protein \nand negatively regulates T cell Ca\n2+\n flux by decreasing KCa3.1 activity (Srivastava et al., 2008). \nKCa3.1 modulation in T cells is thus one of the rare examples of histidine \nphosphorylation\/dephosphorylation influencing a biological process in mammals.  \n 7 \n There are several tools for the study of KCa3.1 function. Charybdotoxin is a 37-amino acid \npeptide isolated from the venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus and blocks KCa3.1 with \na Kd of 5 nM, but also blocks the large conductance K\n+\n channel KCa1.1 (BKCa) and Kv1.3 with \nsimilar potency (Chandy et al., 2004; Wulff et al., 2007). Another more potent, but less \ncommonly used peptidic KCa3.1 blocker is maurotoxin (Kd 1 nM) from the venom of the Tunisian \nscorpion Scorpio maurus (Kharrat et al., 1996; Castle et al., 2003). In contrast to charybdotoxin, \nmaurotoxin does not affect KCa1.1 but instead potently inhibits the voltage-gated Kv1.2 channel \n(Kd 100 pM). Structural modification of the azole antimycotic clotrimazole (Kd 70-250 nM) has \nresulted in the generation of the small molecule TRAM-34, which specifically blocks KCa3.1 with \na Kd of 20 nM. TRAM-34 blocks KCa3.1 by binding to internal residues below the selectivity \nfilter, in contrast to charybdotoxin which binds to the external pore (Wulff et al., 2000). ICA-\n17043 (Kd 11 nM) is another small molecule blocker with high specificity for KCa3.1 (Stocker et \nal., 2003). Interestingly, KCa3.1 channels can be activated by a number of benzimidazolones and \nbenzothiazoles, which increase the Ca\n2+\n sensitivity of these Ca\n2+\n\/calmodulin-gated channels. The \n\u201cclassic\u201d activator 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (1-EBIO) activates heterologously expressed \nKCa3.1 with an EC50 of 30 M, and achieves maximal K\n+\n currents at 100 M in the presence of \n100 nM free Ca\n2+\n, which is below the resting [Ca\n2+\n]i of most cell types (Pedersen et al., 1999). A \nmore potent KCa3.1 activator is the recently described benzothiazole SKA-31 (naphtho[1,2-\nd]thiazol-2-ylamine) which activates KCa3.1 with an EC50 of 250 nM (Sankaranarayanan et al., \n2009). The structures of PAP-1, TRAM-34, ICA-17043, EBIO and SKA-31 are shown in Fig.2. \nand the selectivity of TRAM-34, PAP-1 and SKA-31 in table 1. \n \n 8 \nCellular Expression and Function of Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 \nIn this section we will give a brief summary of what is currently known about the expression and \n(patho)physiological function of Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 in T cells, mast cells, epithelial cells, airway \nsmooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. \nT cells: Human T cells express both Kv1.3 and KCa3.1. However, the relative expression of the \ntwo channels depends on the activation and differentiation states of the cells and correlates with \nthe expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 and the phosphatase CD45RA. In the resting \nstate, CCR7\n+\nCD45RA\n+\n na\u00efve T cells, CCR7\n+\nCD45RA\n-\n central memory T cells (TCM) and CCR7\n-\nCD45RA\n- \neffector memory T cells (TEM) in both the CD4 and the CD8 compartment express \n~250 Kv1.3 and less than 20 KCa3.1 channels per cell (Wulff et al., 2003; Beeton et al., 2003). \nFollowing activation na\u00efve and TCM cells transcriptionally up-regulate KCa3.1 to 500 channels per \ncell without any change in Kv1.3 expression (Fig. 3). In contrast, CCR7\n-\n TEM cells exclusively \nincrease Kv1.3 expression to 1500 to 2000 channels per cell following activation. This \ndifferential expression of Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 in CCR7\n+\n versus CCR7\n-\n T cells has important \nfunctional consequences. Na\u00efve and TCM cells are initially affected by Kv1.3 blockers but quickly \nbecome insensitive to them because they up-regulate KCa3.1 during activation and then rely on \nKCa3.1 for proliferation and cytokine secretion (Ghanshani et al., 2000; Wulff et al., 2003). In \ncontrast, CCR7\n- \nTEM cells solely rely on Kv1.3 for their activation processes and Kv1.3 blockers \nlike ShK(L5) and PAP-1 potently inhibit their Ca\n2+\n flux following TCR ligation, and their IFN , \nIL-2 and IL-17 production as well as their proliferation (Beeton et al., 2006; Azam et al., 2007). \nKv1.3 blockers have therefore been proposed for the selective suppression of TEM cells, while \nKCa3.1 blockers are regarded as more useful for immune responses that are carried by CCR7\n+\n \nna\u00efve and TCM cells. In pre-activated T cells, KCa3.1 channels are localised evenly throughout the \n 9 \nT cell plasma membrane, but rapidly redistribute to the immunological synapse following antigen \npresentation, where they co-localise with CD3 and F-actin (Nicolaou et al., 2007). Similar \nfindings have been reported in TEM cells for Kv1.3 which co-localises at the immunological \nsynapse with Kv\u03b22, SAP97 (synapse-associated protein 97), ZIP (PKC \u03b6-interacting protein, \np56\nlck\n-associated p62 protein), p56\nlck\n, and CD4 (Beeton et al., 2006) . \n Whether a Kv1.3 or a KCa3.1 blocker would be more useful for suppressing T cells in \nasthmatic airways is currently not clear because both Th1 cells (Krug et al., 1996) (which are \npresumably of a TEM phenotype) and Th2 cells (which have been reported to express high levels \nof KCa3.1 (Fanger et al., 2000)) are implicated in the immunopathology of asthma (Robinson et \nal., 1992). The fact that Kv1.3 blockers strongly inhibit the IL-2 and IFN  production of T cells \nfrom the synovial fluid of patients with RA but have little effect on IL-4 and TNF  production \n(Beeton et al., 2006), might suggest that Kv1.3 is not an ideal target in asthma. However, there is \ngood evidence of IFN  over-expression by asthmatic T cells (Krug et al., 1996; Brightling et al., \n2002), and activation of Th1-dependent pathways such as the CXCR3\/CXCL10 axis (Brightling \net al., 2005; Miotto et al., 2001).  \n \nMast cells:  While Kv1.3 is not expressed in human or mouse mast cells, we have identified \nKCa3.1 expression in human lung, blood-derived and bone marrow-derived mast cells in humans \n(Duffy et al., 2001; Duffy et al., 2004; Kaur et al., 2005). In addition, Shumilina et al. have \ndescribed the presence of KCa3.1 in mouse bone-marrow derived mast cells (Shumilina et al., \n2008). KCa3.1 channels open following IgE-dependent activation (Duffy et al., 2001; Duffy et al., \n2005; Kaur et al., 2005; Duffy et al., 2007) resulting in acute plasma membrane \nhyperpolarisation (Fig.4) and enhanced Ca\n2+\n influx from the extracellular fluid, but with no effect \n 10 \non Ca\n2+\n release from internal stores (Duffy et al., 2001; Duffy et al., 2004; Shumilina et al., \n2008). In consequence, block of KCa3.1 channels in human lung mast cells (HLMC) with \ncharybdotoxin attenuates HLMC histamine release in response to IgE-dependent activation \n(Duffy et al., 2001). Similarly, in mouse bone-marrow-derived mast cells cultured from KCa3.1 \nknockout mice, degranulation in response to IgE-dependent activation is reduced by ~50% \nalthough IL-6 secretion is not affected (Shumilina et al., 2008). Since secretion is only partially \ndependent on channel opening, KCa3.1 can be considered to increase the gain of an \nimmunological stimulus. Although histamine release is not completely abrogated by KCa3.1 \nknockout, the KCa3.1 knockout mouse nevertheless has less severe systemic anaphylactic \nreactions (Shumilina et al., 2008), indicating this is biologically relevant.  \n Growth of bone marrow-derived mast cells in KCa3.1 knockout mice, or HLMC in the \npresence of KCa3.1 blockers is normal (Cruse et al., 2006; Shumilina et al., 2008). However, \nblockade of KCa3.1 with charybdotoxin or TRAM-34 markedly attenuates HLMC chemotaxis to \nthe chemokine CXCL10, stem cell factor (SCF), and the complex milieu of chemokines present \nin asthmatic ASM conditioned media (Cruse et al., 2006) (Fig. 5). The mechanisms behind this \nare likely to involve interference with the regulation of cell volume and inhibition of detachment \nof the rear cell body during migration as described in other cell types (Schwab et al., 2006).   \n We have observed that KCa3.1 is regulated in HLMC by the 2-adrenoceptor (Duffy et al., \n2005), the adenosine A2A receptor (Duffy et al., 2007), and EP2 prostanoid receptor (Duffy et al., \n2008). The effects occur rapidly, and are not modulated by analogues of cAMP or forskolin, \nsuggesting they occur through a Gs-coupled membrane-delimited mechanism (Duffy et al., \n2005). Activation of these receptors closes KCa3.1, which may explain in part how they inhibit \n 11 \nboth mast cell secretion and migration (Duffy et al., 2007; Duffy et al., 2008; Gebhardt et al., \n2005).  \n \nEpithelium: The airway epithelium is at the interface with the external environment, and is the \nfirst structure to interact with noxious stimuli such as allergens, viruses and pollutants. Not only \ndoes the columnar epithelium tend to shed from the basal layer, the airway epithelium is also \nfunctionally abnormal in asthma (Holgate et al., 1999; Puddicombe et al., 2000). Epithelial repair \nnormally involves up-regulation of the EGF receptor, which drives the repair response. In \nasthmatic epithelium, the proliferative repair response is impeded, but other consequences of \nEGF receptor activation remain intact. Thus there is on-going release of pro-inflammatory \ncytokines which may promote cellular recruitment, and there is release of profibrogenic growth \nfactors which may drive the remodelling response (Holgate et al., 1999; Puddicombe et al., \n2000). Both Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 are expressed by epithelial cell lines (Grunnet et al., 2003; Devor \net al., 1999). In particular, KCa3.1 has been reported in Calu-3 cells (Devor et al., 1999). The \nproposed role for KCa3.1 in epithelium is to reduce HCO3\n-\n secretion and to increase Cl\n-\n secretion \n(Devor et al., 1999). We predict that KCa3.1 will contribute to the secretion of pro-inflammatory \ncytokines and mucus by epithelial cells through its ability to potentiate Ca\n2+\n influx.  \n \nAirway smooth muscle (ASM) and fibroblasts: The central physiological abnormality in asthma \nis bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), which results in airflow obstruction in response to \nbronchospastic stimuli (Boulet, 2003; Boushey et al., 1980). The ASM in asthma is therefore \nhighly dysfunctional, and in addition demonstrates both hypertrophy and hyperplasia (Ebina et \nal., 1990; Ebina et al., 1993). Whether the ASM in asthma is fundamentally different to that in \n 12 \nnormal subjects due to either genetic or acquired factors is not known. However, in vitro several \nprofound phenotypic differences are evident (Johnson et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2001; Burgess \net al., 2003; Brightling et al., 2005; Roth et al., 2004). We were the first to demonstrate that \nKCa3.1 is expressed by both normal and asthmatic human ASM (Shepherd et al., 2007). KCa3.1 \nexpression is increased by both basicFGF and TGF , and KCa3.1 inhibition with TRAM-34 \nattenuates human ASM proliferation (Shepherd et al., 2007). This up-regulation of KCa3.1 in \nASM is reminiscent of the KCa3.1 up-regulation that occurs in mouse, rat and pig vascular or \ncoronary SM during the remodelling  associated with  restenosis and atherosclerosis (Kohler et \nal., 2003; Tharp et al., 2006; Tharp et al., 2008; Toyama et al., 2008). We envisage that KCa3.1 \nmediates important biological effects in ASM of asthmatic subjects and that KCa3.1 blockade \nmight at least partially prevent ASM remodelling. \n Fibroblasts, specifically myofibroblasts, contribute to the deposition of collagen beneath \nthe airway epithelium in asthma (Brewster et al., 1990). Fibroblast cell lines express a KCa \nchannel with the biophysical properties of KCa3.1 (Rane, 1991; Pena & Rane, 1999) and \ncharybdotoxin prevents FGF-induced fibroblast proliferation. Whether primary human airway \nfibroblasts express KCa3.1 has not been reported, however, we believe it is highly likely that \nKCa3.1 plays an important role in the fibrogenic activity of human airway fibroblasts.   \n \nOther cells \nKCa3.1 is also expressed by other cells of potential importance to asthma. Human endothelial cell \nexpression of KCa3.1 was increased by both basicFGF and VEGF, two growth factors implicated \nin the angiogenesis which characterises human asthma (Shute et al., 2004; Siddiqui et al., 2007). \nBlockade of KCa3.1 with charybdotoxin and TRAM-34 inhibited human endothelial cell \n 13 \nproliferation in vitro, while TRAM-34 inhibited angiogenesis in mice in an in vivo matrigel plug \nassay (Grgic et al., 2005). Inhibition of KCa3.1 may therefore be expected to prevent or reverse \nthe angiogenesis evident in asthmatic airways. \n Macrophages have also been implicated in asthma although their role remains poorly \ndefined (Holgate, 2008). KCa3.1 is expressed by human and mouse macrophages and KCa3.1 \nknock-out or pharmacological inhibition has been shown to suppress macrophage  activation and \nmigration (Toyama et al., 2008; Schmid-Antomarchi et al., 1997). KCa3.1 has not been described \nto-date in eosinophils. \n \nRoles in disease \nPharmacological blockers of both Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 have been tested in many disease models. \nCompounds which block Kv1.3 suppress effector memory T cell function in vitro and effectively \ntreat memory T cell-mediated immune reactions such as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH ) in \nrats and minipigs (Schmitz et al., 2005; Koo et al., 1997; Beeton et al., 2005),  as well as \nexperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Beeton et al., 2001), experimental \nautoimmune diabetes (Beeton et al., 2006), pristane-induced arthritis (Beeton et al., 2006) and \nallergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in rats (Azam et al., 2007), without causing any toxic side \neffects (Beeton et al., 2006). In all these disease models Kv1.3 blockers seem to have selectively \nsuppressed TEM cell functions as suggested by a recent two-photon in vivo imaging study, which \nshowed that Kv1.3 blockers inhibited DTH and suppressed TEM cell enlargement and motility in \ninflamed tissue but had no effect on homing to or motility in lymph nodes of naive and central \nmemory T cells (Matheu et al., 2008). In keeping with this observation, Kv1.3 blockers did not \nprevent antigen presentation and memory T cell development in oxazolone induced ACD in rats \n 14 \nbut effectively inhibited ear swelling during the TEM cell mediated effector phase of the disease \n(Azam et al., 2007).  \nKCa3.1 blockers which inhibit the activation and migration of na\u00efve T cells, and many \nstructural and inflammatory cells in vitro, and have been shown to treat EAE in mice and to \nprevent vascular restenosis after systemic delivery in rats (Kohler et al., 2003) and after local \ndelivery in pigs (Tharp et al., 2008). The KCa3.1 blocker TRAM-34 further reduces \natherosclerosis development in ApoE\n-\/-\n mice by inhibiting both vascular smooth muscle cell \nproliferation and T cell and macrophage activity (Toyama et al., 2008). Of relevance to asthma, \nthe KCa3.1 knockout mouse displays an attenuated IgE-dependent systemic anaphylactic response \n(Shumilina et al., 2008). Furthermore, it is reported on the website of the pharmaceutical \ncompany Icagen Inc. that the orally active KCa3.1 blocker ICA-17043 (Senicapoc) inhibits the \nlate airway response and the development of BHR following allergen challenge in a sheep model \nof asthma  (http:\/\/www.icagen.com\/randd\/memorydisorders.html). \n \nSafety of Targeting Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 \nKv1.3: A key issue for any long-term therapy is a favourable balance between efficacy and safety.  \nIn addition to CCR7\n-\n TEM cells, Kv1.3 is also expressed in the central nervous system, kidney, \nliver, skeletal muscle, platelets, macrophages, testis, and osteoclasts, raising the possibility that \nKv1.3 blockers could have adverse side effects. To investigate this possibility, the Wulff and \nChandy laboratories performed 28-day and 6-month toxicity studies with PAP-1 (50 mg\/kg\/d \norally) and a 28-day toxicity study with ShK-L5 (500 \u03bcg\/kg\/d s.c.) in both male and female rats \n(Beeton et al., 2006). [Please note that PAP-1 effectively prevents autoimmune diabetes in \n 15 \ndiabetes prone BB\/Wor rats at the same dose and that ShK-L5 suppresses DTH at 10 g\/kg and \ntreats EAE at 100 g\/kg]. Both blockers failed to induce any histopathological changes in any \ntissue examined, including those reported to express Kv1.3. PAP-1 and ShK-L5 also did not \ninduce any changes in hematological or serum chemistry parameters. Both blockers further did \nnot delay influenza virus clearance in rats suggesting that Kv1.3 blockers truly selectively inhibit \nTEM cells and do not affect the function of na\u00efve and TCM cells (Matheu et al., 2008). In \ncollaboration with Dr. Aftab Ansari at the Primate Center of Emory University, the Wulff \nlaboratory also administered PAP-1 at 25 mg\/kg\/d for 28-days to rhesus macaques. The treatment \nagain did not induce any changes in blood chemistry or hematology and did not affect the \ndevelopment of a protective TCM response following nasal flu vaccination (Pereira et al., 2007). \nHowever, in keeping with a role of TEM cells in suppressing chronic viral infections, PAP-1 \ntreatment caused a reactivation of CMV virus, which however did not result in any symptoms of \nCMV disease but was detectable by PCR.  Before performing these experiments we thoroughly \ntested PAP-1 for in vitro toxicity and found that it is not cytotoxic, not phototoxic, and is \nnegative in the Ames test which assesses mutagenic potential. Most importantly, PAP-1 exhibits \nexcellent selectivity over other ion channels as well as various receptors and transporters \n(Schmitz et al., 2005). The relative safety of Kv1.3 blockers may be due in part to channel \nredundancy and also because Kv1.3 blockers may not inhibit Kv1.3-containing heteromultimers \n(e.g., in the CNS) with the same affinity as Kv1.3 homotetramers in T cells.  \n \nKCa3.1: Similar to Kv1.3, KCa3.1 seems to be relatively safe as a therapeutic target. Two \nindependently generated KCa3.1\n-\/-\n mice (Begenisich et al., 2004; Si et al., 2006) were both viable, \nof normal appearance, produced normal litter sizes, did not show any gross abnormalities in any \n 16 \nof their major organs and exhibited rather mild phenotypes: impaired volume regulation in \nerythrocytes and lymphocytes (Begenisich et al., 2004), a reduced EDHF response together with \na mild ~7 mmHg increase in blood pressure (Si et al., 2006), and subtle erythrocyte macrocytosis \nand progressive splenomegaly (Grgic et al., 2008). Pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 also \nseems to be safe and well tolerated. TRAM-34 exhibits an excellent selectivity over other ion \nchannels and was \u201cclean\u201d in a Hit Profiling screen on 32 neuronal receptors and transporters \n(Wulff et al., 2000; Toyama et al., 2008). Daily administration of TRAM-34 at 120 mg\/kg\/d did \nnot induce any changes in blood chemistry, hematology or necropsy of major organs in a 28-day \ntoxicity study in mice or rats (Toyama et al., 2008). There have also been no reports about \ntoxicity for the structurally related KCa3.1 blocker ICA-17043 (Senicapoc), which was developed \nby Icagen Inc. and which entered clinical trials as an orphan drug for sickle cell anemia (Stocker \net al., 2003). ICA-17043 was found to be both effective and safe in Phase-2 clinical trials (Ataga \net al., 2008) but the phase-III trials were stopped in 2007 due to a lack of efficacy in reducing \nsickling crises. ICA-17043 recently re-entered clinical trials and is currently being evaluated for \nasthma in two phase-II proof-of-concept trials. Dose-escalating studies with ICA-17043 in 28 \notherwise healthy patients with sickle cell disease did not increase blood pressure or lead to \nelectrocardiogram changes (Ataga et al., 2006; Ataga et al., 2008).   \n \nSummary \nIn summary, Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 regulate many diverse cell processes of relevance to asthma. As \nsuch, they offer the potential for the development of a truly novel approach to the treatment of \nthis disease. Further validation of these targets is required to define which aspects of the \nasthmatic process are most likely to be attenuated by Kv1.3 or KCa3.1 blockade in humans. In turn \n 17 \nthis will help determine the primary outcomes for clinical trials. For example, if eosinophilia is \nthe predominant feature which is inhibited, then the rate of exacerbations should be the primary \noutcome (Green et al., 2002), whereas if bronchial hyperresponsiveness or remodelling is the \npredominant feature which improves, then measurement of these as the primary outcome would \nbe more appropriate.  The studies to-date with Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 blockers are encouraging, and \nthe lack of any toxicity with ICA-17043 when administered to humans with sickle cell disease or \nof TRAM-34 and PAP-1 administered to rodents and primates, suggests real therapeutic potential \nfor human disease. \n \n \n \nConflicts of interest \nPB has undertaken contract research and acted as a consultant for Icagen Inc..

The rise in intracellular \nCa\n2+\n activates the phosphatase calcineurin, which then dephosphorylates the transcription factor \nnuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), enabling it to translocate to the nucleus and to bind to \nthe promoter of cytokine genes such as interleukin 2 (IL-2). CRAC, Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 critically \nregulate Ca\n2+\n signalling. Depletion of internal Ca\n2+\n stores is \u201csensed\u201d by the EF-hand containing \nstromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which redistributes and clusters into sites adjacent to \nplasma membrane and activated CRAC channels. The ensuing Ca\n2+\n influx through CRAC \nchannels depolarizes the T cell and reduces Ca\n2+\n entry through the \u201cinward\u201d-rectifier CRAC. The \ndriving force for Ca\n2+\n entry is restored by membrane hyperpolarization brought about by the \nopening of Kv1.3 channels in response to membrane depolarization and the opening of KCa3.1 \nchannels in response to Ca\n2+\n binding to calmodulin (CAM). [The resting intracellular Ca\n2+\n \nconcentration in a T cells is 50-100 nM and rises to about 1 M during T cell activation. The \nextracellular Ca\n2+\n concentration is 1-2 mM]. \n \n 29 \nFigure 2 \nThe chemical structures of PAP-1, TRAM-34, ICA-17043, 1-EBIO and SKA-31. \n \nFigure 3 \nKv1.3 versus KCa3.1 channel numbers per cell in na\u00efve, TCM and TEM CD4\n+\n T cells before and \nafter activation. \n \nFigure 4 \nOpening of KCa3.1 channels (A) and hyperpolarisation of the plasma membrane (B) in a human \nperipheral blood-derived mast cell following IgE-dependent activation.
