We introduce an \nanthropologically informed debate on healing dreaming in Islam and Islamic \nhealing dreaming practices. Based on our research, we discuss ethnographic \nexamples of Istikhara as practised by British Pakistanis, Pakistanis and last \nbut not least a case study from a corner of the Muslim world, Muslim Bosnia. \nWe explore a shared propensity to dream, though a culturally informed one, \nand situate the practice into a general economy of Muslim well-being.  \n \nKey words: dreaming, healing, Islam, Istikhara, Pakistan, Bosnia  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n \nIf you ask a Muslim about dreams, you will be perhaps told of a significant \ndream narrative that has influenced his\/her life. Through the capacity and \npower of the imagination Muslims transfigure dreams creatively into \ncomprehensive and persuasive narratives that help them to navigate the \nunpredictable terrain of everyday life and overcome the afflictions or \nencounters with supposed malevolent powers. Islam and dreams are \ninevitably interrelated since its very outset and we might think of Islam as \nprobably the largest night dream culture in the world today. Dreams have \nbeen firmly anchored in the imagination of many Muslim societies and Islamic \ntraditions at large, in the past as well as in the present. \nThe scriptural tradition differentiates between three kinds of dreams. First \ncome true spiritual dreams, ru\u2019an, inspired by God; second come dreams \ninspired by the devil; third come dreams from the nafs, or ego which are \nconsidered unimportant. As we have argued elsewhere (Edgar & Henig 2010: \n66), from West Africa to the Philippines, the tripartite schematization of \ndreams explained above is part of the world view of the majority of Muslims, \nnot just the especially pious. This was confirmed by Edgar\u201fs fieldwork in the \nUK, Turkey, Northern Cyprus, and Pakistan and by Henig\u201fs fieldwork in \nDagestan and collaborative research in Bosnia-Herzegovina, during which we \nwere interviewing people from all walks of life. \n   \nHowever, an important part of dream lore in Islam is the relatively little known, \noutside of the Islamic community, phenomena of Istikhara. Istikhara has one \nmain practice with either a focus on consequent daytime guidance or \nguidance through dream symbolism. Different authors (Aydar 2009, Gouda \n1991) stress the importance of daytime guidance whilst others stress \nguidance experienced through dreams. Nonetheless, most of the sources we \nhave come across during our fieldworks include dreams as one core part of \nistikhara practice. Aydar (2009: 123) describes the essence of istikhara thus: \n \nIn such cases (where a Muslim is unsure as to the correct action to take) \npeople frequently ask God to send them a sign concerning the outcome. \nThen they pray and go to sleep. If they see the colours white or green in \n 3 \ntheir dream, or important religious personages, or envision peace and \ntranquillity, or pleasant, beneficial or beautiful things, then they decide \nthat the waking life action will be beneficial and they undertake it with an \neasy heart. If they see the colours black, yellow or red, or an unpleasant \ntype of person, or things that make them uneasy or which are ugly, then \nthey decide that this action is not beneficial and they forgo performing it. \n \nMoreover, Aydar (2009:126-127) reports that in several hadiths, including \nBukhari, it is said that the Prophet Mohammed taught his companions \nistikhara and the detail of the istikhara prayer and recommended it to them. \nAydar further reports that given the Prophet\u201fs recommendation to undertake \nistikhara then it is a sunnah action (Prophetic example) to be done if possible \nbefore embarking on any enterprise (2009:127). \n \nThe argument about Islam as probably the largest night dream culture in the \nworld today poses a set of other questions, notably about Muslims\u201f propensity \nto dream in a particular way as a culturally informed practice and imagination. \nIn doing so, based on our respective fieldworks we present how Muslims \nperceive, imagine and narrate their dream experiences, and istikhara in \nparticular. Yet, we consider istikhara, dream incubation practice, as a kind of \nIslamic folk healing practice. Therefore, we present ethnographic narratives \nfrom various corners of Muslim world concerning istikhara, and particularly \nrich narrative accounts as told by (British) Pakistani Muslims and an istikhara \nand Islamic healer from Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to open a question \nabout the relationship between dreaming, healing and religion. As Csordas \nargues (1994: 1, 3) \n \nInsofar as every culture must contend with emotional distress and mental \nillness, each is likely to develop its own forms of psychotherapy, some of \nwhich we can identify as religious healing (...) there is an experiential \nspecificity of effect in religious healing (...) the locus of efficacy is not \nsymptoms, psychiatric disorders, symbolic meaning, or social \nrelationships, but the self in which all of these are encompassed.   \n \n 4 \nIn this paper through presenting several ethnographic-cum-dream micro-case-\nstudies, we argue that dreaming as practised by Muslims of various cultural \ntraditions, and the Bosnian Islamic healer\u201fs account of encounters with divine \npowers and malevolent spirits via dreams cast light on the dynamics of \nMuslims\u201f inner and outer worlds as interrelated processes of embodied \nconstructions of well-being,  and also on a general Muslim cosmology of \nwelfare.  \n \n \nIslam, dreaming and ethnographies \n \nIn multifaceted and tapestried Islamic traditions the practice of guidance \nfollowing the istikhara prayer varies, and the decisive  authority of interpreting \ndreams differs. The relationship as to authority over dream interpretations is \neven more obvious in a Sufi practice. In her fieldwork on British Pakistani Sufi \norders, and particularly of the one founded by a charismatic Sufi saint, Shaykh \nZindapir from the NWFP, Werbner (2003) learnt about Sufi cosmology from a \nsenior Sufi, Hajji Karim, a follower of the Shaykh, and she provides a glimpse \nof such a guidance as told by Hajji Karim: \n \nThe pir (Shaykh) knows if a person is ready to embark on the journey \n(spiritual ascent) just by looking at the person, he has inspiration or \nrevelation from God (ilham); otherwise, he can seek istikhara, indirect \nsigns (a form of divination). There are two forms of istikhara: either the \nSaint reads a passage from the Qur\u201fan and then falls asleep. At the start \nof his sleep he sees colours and signs which he can interpret as positive \nor negative. Certain colours such as green and white are positive; others \nsuch as black, red, or yellow, are negative. The other method is to read \nthe opening Surah (chapter) of the Qur\u201fan and repeat the words (after \nthe third or fourth line) again and again while praying. In this wakeful \nrepetition, the head will tilt to the left or the right and this will indicate \nwhether the answer is positive or negative (Werbner 2003: 193-4). \n \n 5 \nIn this excerpt we see that a Shaykh can perform istikhara for a follower and \nuses a rich colourful symbolism in order to reveal \u201ethe truth\u201f to his murid. The \nprayer and reading from the Qur\u201fan is used in many Islamic traditions \namongst the Sunni and Shia alike and we have found those practices during \nour fieldwork. The divinatory method of reading the inclination of the head, \nhowever, we have not encountered before. Interestingly, Werbner\u201fs studies \nconfirm the central role of dreams and visions amongst Sufis and their \nShaykhs reliance upon them: \n \nHis life, as told by him or about him by his disciples, has been the life of \na friend of Allah, and as such it has been a life motivated by and moved \nteleologically through the guidance of divinely inspired dreams and \nvisions\u2026\u2026.He (Zindapir) has been guided, like all Sufi Saints  (major \nShaykhs) only by religious imperatives known to him through visions and \ndreams (Werbner 2003: 61). \n \nIn his famous portrait of Moroccan toolmaker Tuhami and his encounters with \n\u201eSaints, Jnun (Jinn) and dreams\u201f, Crapanzano (1975: 148-9) refers to the \npractice of Stikhara which refers to intentional dream incubation as practised \nin Morocco at a sacred site, such as a saint\u201fs tomb. Crapanzano reports that \nsuch practices are important amongst members of the Hamadsha sect \nlikewise amongst ordinary Moroccans. Similarly, Nile Green (2003: 307) refers \nto the practice of istikhara in Islam that is used both by Sufis and ordinary \npilgrims and entailed dream incubation, sleeping at tombs and performing the \naforementioned cycle of special prayers. Also, Shaw (1992: 47) refers to the \nTemne people of north-eastern Sierra Leone\u201fs use of istikhara (called the an-\nListikhaar). There Islamic dream diviners: \n \nconstructs an Islamic amulet or simply writes a passage from the Qur\u201fan \ntogether with the client\u201fs name on a piece of paper, and prays to Allah \nfor the solution to the client\u201fs problem before going to sleep with his \nhead resting on the written sheet. The answer is revealed in the diviner\u201fs \ndreams. \n \n 6 \nDilley (1992) in his study of the Tukolor weavers in Senegal and their reported \ninspiration through dreams in their craftwork, also describes the istikhara \npractice (here called Listikhaar). The learned Islamic clerics providing \nauthoritative interpretations are called marabouts. Dilley describes this \npractice thus: \n \nA person concerned over a family or personal matter might consult a \nmarabout who practices Listikhaar. The client reveals his problem to him \nand requests that it be addressed to Allah through his intermediary, the \nmarabout. The marabout then uses specified procedures to evoke \ndreams during a night retreat after the consultation with his client. He \nfirst prepares himself by performing ritual ablutions, offering up prayers \nand reciting his client\u201fs request that evening before he finally falls \nasleep. During the night it is said that a dream which contains guidance \nover the client\u201fs problem comes to the marabout, making it known \nwhether his prayers have been granted or not. \n \nHowever, there are no detailed scholarly studies, as opposed to occasional \naccounts in the above-mentioned examples, concerning the istikhara practice \nper se and its significance for a general Muslim cosmology of belief and well-\nbeing. Interestingly, one of the few is Aydar (2009) who reports that in 1991 \nhe was considering marriage to a particular young woman but the family \nasked their Shaykh to perform istikhara for them and on the basis of that \nistikhara refused his marriage request.1 Aydar then describes the \npsychological benefits of performing istikhara  as through following the advice \nof an istikhara experience the person gains confidence in their choice of \naction and as we know through the idea of the self-fulfilling prophecy, a \npositive approach to any endeavour may beneficially effect the outcome. \nFinally, having confirmed the very widespread use of istikhara across Islamic \ncountries, Aydar writes that the dream version of istikhara is not specifically \nsanctioned in \u201etrue religious sources\u201f by which we understand him to mean the \nQur\u201fan and the strongest hadiths, such as Bukhari, Sahih and Moslem.  \n                                                 \n1\n Aydar is a Turkish academic living in Istanbul. \n 7 \nHowever, it is also clear from our own studies of the Qur\u201fan and the hadith \ncomposed by Bukhari that dream interpretation is clearly defined in the \nhadiths as possibly being a way to access the divine will through al-ruya or \ntrue dreams (Edgar and Henig 2010: 65-67). Also the Prophet Mohammed \ndescribes true dreams that he experiences in the Qur\u201fan (Lamoreux 2002). \nOur recent researches on the role of night dreams in Islam (Edgar \n2004, 2006a,b and 2007; Edgar and Henig 2010) in the UK, Turkey, Bosnia, \nPakistan and Northern Cyprus have shown that istikhara as practiced \nparticularly in marriage choice but also sometimes in political and business \ndecision-making, by young and old alike, is a significant feature of a general \nMuslim cosmology of belief and well-being.   \nAs we have seen above, istikhara involves reciting special ritual \nprayers before going to bed and meditation upon life choices, such as \nmarriage, before sleeping. During his research on the inspirational night \ndreams, Edgar (2006a) interviewed one Pakistani woman living in the UK who \ndid istikhara about her daughter\u201fs future marriage. She dreamt of a good \nlooking bowl of dates which however in the event didn\u201ft taste very nice. She \nreported how this imagery anticipated the outcome of the marriage. \nThe following example, from Edgar\u201fs fieldwork is of a daughter \n(granddaughter of an ex-leader of an Islamic country) talking of her father\u201fs (a \ndevelopment consultant for a major NGO) use of istikhara concerning a \nbusiness deal, when making a big investment with rather unknown people, he \ndid it and dreamt of,  \n \na large white cake which was cut into pieces: as white is a good colour \nand had a happy feeling so he went ahead with the investment; half way \nthrough the investment people turned out to be too clever; he had \ninvested a lot of money and they were wondering if it had been a good \ninvestment, but when the money was returned it was much more than \nwas expected; there was a rocky period but it came out well eventually. \n \n One of Edgar\u201fs main informants during his research in Pakistan, the well \nknown BBC journalist, Rahimullah Yusufzai, was asked to perform istikhara \nbefore he finally decided whether to accept a cabinet job in the newly formed \n 8 \ngovernment of the North West Frontier Province in Pakistan. He did istikhara \nand then finally refused the post (cf. Edgar 2006b). \nAs we argue in this paper a propensity for dreaming about decision \nmaking related with the life cycle is a common practice ranging throughout the \nMuslim world, and amongst Muslims in Pakistan and British Pakistanis in \nparticular.2 When Edgar interviewed a young Pakistani woman\u201fs mother who \ndid istikhara about a marriage proposal, she said \n \nMy Mother did Istikhara for her cousin; there was a proposal and she \nwanted to see: in her dream she saw a festive occasion and her daughter \nis standing in front of a pot of milk and you know, white is good; but my \ncousin was actually pouring this red liquid juice into it so there was a \ncatch in it; eventually the whole pot turned; the marriage didn\u201ft happen \nand later they found out that he didn\u201ft come from such a good or nice \nfamily.  \n \nIshtikhara in Bosnia: dreaming and imagination on the periphery \n \nIn many respects, Bosnia-Herzegovina re-appeared on a map of the Muslim \nworld only after the break down of Yugoslavia and the subsequent upheavals \nthat resulted in to the single most horrific event of the aftermath of Yugoslav \nwar, the Srebrenica Massacre. Although the ethno-religious nationalism has \nbecome a dominant everyday form of political identification in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, we are concerned in this paper with a continuity of culturally \ninformed Muslim ontology and cosmology, and of a dreaming practice in \nparticular. The case study of istikhara practice from Bosnia-Herzegovina \nlocated on the periphery of the Islamic world, seems to be a well-suited \nethnographic example, embracing the question about Muslims\u201f propensity to \ndream in a particular way as well as showing particular culturally informed \npractice of istikhara, yet it enables us to contextualise and locate this \ndreaming practice within a general Muslim cosmology of well-being.  \n \n                                                 \n2\n Allen also reports that salat al Istikhara (prayer of proper guidance) is commonplace \namongst Palestinian refugees in Shatil refugee camps (2006: 28). \n 9 \nIslamic healers in Bosnia as elsewhere provide a divinatory service to the lay \nBosnian Muslims. One such practice is praying istikhara.  As Bringa pointed \nout (1995: 215), these prayers are used particularly by women who come to \nask the healer to pray istikhara on their behalf to predict the future. \nParticularly, the healers are often asked for praying istikhara by Muslim \nwomen while they are considering their marriage-choice. Similarly, among \nMuslim women in the mountains of Central Bosnia where Henig conducted his \nresearch an individual doing istikhara is not an unknown practice and often \nprecedes their marriage-concerned decisions. In their confirmatory dreams, \nMuslim women often dream about a house with a nice colourful garden and \nwith many flowers around, or about a house with a small wild garden and with \nsheep and lambs in it. These often mentioned dream images emerge in \nnarratives to become culturally shared patterns and idioms of well-being as \nconceived by Muslims in the mountains. However, a revelatory potential of \ndreams, and dream symbolism might be also used by Muslims facing \nmisfortune or physical and mental harm and subsequently as a way of \ncounteracting those negative influences in order to recuperate from a harmed \nwell-being. \n \nThe most obvious encounters with a negative divine power or spirits (d\u017ein, \njinn) in rural Bosnia that might harm Muslim\u201fs well-being is sihir (sorcery, \nmagic). Based on her fieldwork in Central Bosnia, Bringa (1995: 177-178) \nprovides an account of how Muslim women faced afflictions that could not be \nbe diagnosed nor cured by doctors. Those afflictions were often described by \nthe women as \u201esomething has upset the person\u201f by which a holistically \nconceived well-being of a person, that is, a synergy between belief, body and \nmind was severed (cf. Csordas 1994, MacPhee 2003). Bringa differentiates \nbetween attacks by malevolent spirits (jinn that may enter and attack a \nperson), the evil eye (to be bewitched and get ill), or sihir (cf. Bringa 1995: \n177-184).  \n  \nIn the mountains of Central Bosnia where Henig conducted his fieldwork, \nMuslims conceive sihir as a generic conceptual category in order to classify \n 10 \nany encounter with magical powers. As Azmir-baba, shaykh of a dervish order \nexplained, \n \n\u201ethere are two meanings of sihir. One is the Quranic category that \nmeans \u201cto be led astray from a right path\u201d. The other one is adet \n[custom], that is, tradition and a set of customary beliefs in the \nBosnian countryside. This is related to a black magic, to problems \nbetween people, neighbours or with particular life events, or unusual \nevents such as a sudden illness of people or animals, misfortune and \nso forth. It might be caused by filthy eyes, or bewitching eyes and \nthis might be unconscious. However, it might be also caused \nconsciously by using of particular objects \u00e0 la voodoo that have a \npower and capacity to act negatively and cause negative effects. \nVery often either parts of the body such as nails, hairs, menstruation \nblood or urine are used  which has many negative effects, or some \nanimals\u201f organs or blood. This is, then, usually dug in somewhere \nunder the doorstep and when the person against whom the magic is \ntargeted will walk through the door frame, or cross over the doorstep, \nshe will be caught by the magic. If this happen, the person has to find \nsomeone with a positive power to get rid of the magic.\u201f \n \nIf any Bosnian Muslim has been caught by a magic, or needs to anyhow \ncounteract a negative malevolent power, misfortune or recuperate her \nsomehow harmed well-being she has several possibilities of how to do that. \nFirstly, there are particular dove (prayers) that might be prayed before the \nperson is about to leave the house in order to protect herself, however, those \nhave only temporary effects. Apart from the two suras sometimes called as \n\u201esuras of refuge\u201f, that are, Al-Falaq and an-Nas, Muslims in some \nmountainous villages use other particular dove. Those dove have been used \nin the past by local hod\u017eas (imams), who at the time functioned in the village \ndivision of labour also as healers. Although the traditional local religious and \nhealing experts have been continuously replaced in past decades by more \northodox imams, often trained in the Gulf, who often reject such a practice as \nun-Islamic (cf. Bringa 1995, Ghodsee 2009), those particular dove are still \n 11 \ntransmitted and used by lay Muslims in the mountains.3 Another form of \nprotection against sihir is using and wearing zapis (amulet), a charm with \neither Qur\u201fanic verses or particular dove written in arabic made by a healer or \nhod\u017ea (cf. Bringa 1995: 182). Nonetheless, all of these practices have a rather \nprotecting power. However, in any case of sorcery attack, prolonged physical \nor mental afflictions or long lasting misfortune when a Muslim person is \nstriving to recuperate her well-being, she needs to find a specialist.  \n \nIn this case study we introduce Sadeta a seventy years old Islamic healer \nfrom the capital Sarajevo and we shall look at two moments in her life while \nconsidering dreaming and istikhara in particular. Firstly, we introduce the \nmoment of revelation when Sadeta was \u201ecalled\u201f to practice istikhara at the age \nof fifty three through dream messages. Subsequently, we shall introduce the \npractice of istikhara as conducted by Sadeta. Then, we introduce some of her \ndream narratives in order to illustrate and consider cross-culturally Muslims\u201f \ndream propensity and how it relates to a general Muslim cosmology of well-\nbeing.  \n \nDreaming as revelation \nSadeta had been called in her dreams to be a Qur\u201fanic and istikhara dream \nhealer. She has started to dream in 1990 and since she is often guided and \ninstructed in her dreams by a young handsome man dressed in a white shirt \nthat symbolises to Sadeta a dead shahid (martyr). At the time, she dreamt \nabout the martyr aged 25-30 who told her what she has to do, that is, to help \npeople and to heal people. In her revelatory dreams the martyr instructed her \nto veil herself into the golden abaniya, that is, a golden scarf which people \nwho performed hajj usually brough back from the pilgrimage and which will be \nused to cover their bodies after death. Sadeta dreamt the same dream again \nand again, the young man did not calm her down until she followed the dream  \ninstructions about wearing the abaniya, even despite the fact she has not \nperformed hajj yet. Since she had the first abaniya and went to the mosque to \npray Sadeta has not had the dream never more. Nevertheless, when she \n                                                 \n3\n Some of them are in Bosnian language. \n 12 \ndoes pray istikhara she often dreams of the young man who is telling her what \nshe should do. At the time, she had never prayed istikhara before, until she \ntold other people about her dreams. Therefore, she was advised to visit one \nwell educated hod\u017ea (imam) whom she told about her dreams and she was \nadvised that she could have the capacity for dreaming istikhara and healing. \nThe hod\u017ea then instructed her how to pray istikhara and how to interpret \nistikhara dreams and gave her two books to work with, one a guide to Quranic \nhealing and the other for istikhara. \n \nHowever, it was only after one tevhid (a collective prayer for the souls of the \ndead) in the early 1990s where Sadeta met one hafiz (a person who knows \nthe Qur\u201fan by heart) who discovered that she has the gift from God to help \npeople. He instructed her how to pray against sorcery and gave her a special \ndova that had to be prayed 77 times. Moreover, it was during the war in the \n1990s, that Sadeta once dreamt about an old woman and the woman told her \n\u201edo pray and don\u201ft be afraid of shells, bullets of anything\u201f. It was the wartime \nwhen Sadeta\u201fs husband was old and ill and she had to go everyday for water \nand food. So she did this prayer, which she was told in the dream, every time \nshe went out from the house. However, the women in Sadeta\u201fs dream did not \ntell her how many times she should pray the prayer that Sadeta was told in \nher dream. Therefore, she asked the hafiz who instructed her to do the prayer \n1479 times between Aksam-namaz and Jacija-namaz (4th and 5th daily \nprayers) whenever she has a wish and the God will help her. Yet, the hafiz \ninstructed her to help people but without charging them for money; let people \npay her if they want, but never \u201eprice the Quran\u201f. Today, Sadeta does the \nprayers when someone needs God\u201fs help.    \n \nSadeta\u201fs personal biography and life-narrative of encounters with divine \npowers can\u201ft be separated from her experience of being a healer. As there is \na constitutive synergy of personal well-being, that is, between mind, body and \nsoul, this emanates into the lifeworlds of other Muslims for whom Sadeta \ndreams and those experiences are contextualised and understood within  the \nIslamic cosmological order. Thus, even now it is clear from Sadeta\u201fs narrative \nas to how she conceives her istikhara dreams and healing practice, that is, \n 13 \nthe healing is done from Allah and Sadeta is a vehicle for this form of divine \ngrace. This is highlighted by the fact that she does not use, as a gifted healer, \nthe Quran to interpret her dreams and she rather deciphers dream symbols \nand interprets her dreams intuitively following a dream itself.  \n \nNarrating dreams and well-being \nSadeta in her practice of healing does two types of Islamic healing. She does \npray istikhara for revelation, and\/or (sometimes subsequently) praying specific \ndove from the Qur\u201fan as well as those she got from the hafiz for particular \nconditions. In this paper, however, we only focus on Sadeta\u201fs rich colourful \ndream narratives of istikhara practice as those cast light on the most repeated \nrequests she receives from her clients in order to see how Bosnian Muslims \nconceive, value and understand dreams in their lives. Nonetheless, it would \ngo beyond the scope of the article to analyse tapestried dream motifs as a \nsemiotic system of dream interpretation  in Muslim Bosnia (cf. Holy 1991). We \nhave determined three main tasks and\/or moments in the life-cycle or crisis \nwhen and why Bosnian Muslims usually seek help from Sadeta, and for \npraying istikhara in particular. Those are, 1.\/ marriage choice, 2.\/ sihir and \nencountering the negative powers, and in such a case Sadeta\u201fs counteraction \nwould consist of both dreaming and healing, 3.\/ well-being and protection \nagainst misfortune. Istikhara is part of the Bosnian Muslims\u201f narrating of \nwelfare conceived by all means as a practice related to embodied well-being.        \n \nMarriage narratives \n \nEhh, one young woman asked me for istikhara, she gave me her \nname and surname. I dreamt about a house (she didn\u201ft tell me where \nshe lives), I came (in the dream) in front of a house, I see a house \nwith two entrances. When I\u201fve entered the house I see a small wild \ngarden and there were lambs and sheep. While I was in the garden I \nheard a voice saying: \u201cI am interested in the young woman, I want to \nmarry her, she will have much happiness in her life\u201d. When I told her \nabout the dream, she said that her boyfriend has the same house. \nSo, it means their fate is to stay together. Moreover, sheep and \n 14 \nlambs are usually slaughtered during such an occasion like a \nmarriage; and also wool makes life easy so everything was beautiful \nin the dream. \n \nWhat happened to me, just one example. I dreamt for one woman, \nshe met a man who was a widower and the woman wanted to marry \nhim. So she told me \u201cSadeta, please, pray istikhara for me\u201d, as to \nwhether she could marry the man or not; whether she would be \nhappy with the man or not; so I was dreaming that I entered into a \nhouse, or into a flat because the man lives in the flat. And in the flat I \nsee three flowers and now I was dreaming about the widower\u201fs dead \nwife and she was telling me \u201cI do not have anything about (against) \nthe woman nor about the marriage but please\u201d and she was showing \nme, holding in her hands the three flowers \u201cmake sure that she will \nlook after the flowers\u201d, and the flowers were very beautiful in my \ndream. I woke up, and told the dream to the woman; she had never \nentered the widower\u201fs flat before so she asked him about the flowers \nin his flat. He asked her to come to his flat to see that he had the \nflowers in the flat. She found the same flowers I dreamt about in my \ndream. They got married and have stayed together.  \n \nOn the other hand, although Sadeta is confident about her success with her \nistikhara practice she admits to the occasional apparent failure: \n \nSometimes I do dream about a good marriage and later people \ndivorce. It\u201fs possible, of course. I, for example, dreamt about \n\u201erosemary\u201f [flower usually used for wedding flowers] and the woman I \nhad dreamt for later divorced her husband. But in most cases I am \nsuccessful. \n \n \nNarrating malevolent encounters \n \n 15 \nSometimes the interpretation of a dream might be sorcery. One \nwoman had a flat in Sarajevo and she bought a door but she couldn\u201ft \nplace it properly, it was impossible. Therefore I did pray istikhara for \nher; I dreamt: it\u201fs very bad when you dream like this, that in front of \nthe door someone hooked an ox. And now, I see an ox clearly, I see \nhis meat is rotting, it isn\u201ft good. So, when I dreamt about the rotting \nox, the dream itself was terrible, I told her \u2013 you have to dig up the \nthreshold and the doorframe, there has to be sihir [sorcery]. \nMoreover, I had to pray various prayers against the evil powers for \nher to protect herself. I have got this special prayer from the hafiz \n(educated Moslem who can recite the Qur\u201fan by heart) I told you \nabout and in such a case it needs to be prayed 37 times. When the \nwoman had dug up the threshold around the door, she found \neverything that you can imagine [sorcery items]. \n \nIt\u201fs spread now, a lot of people do it to other people. Jinns [in this \ncontexts negative spirits in the Islamic cosmology] attack but not \nwithout reason. But people do sihiri [sorcery], make sihiri. Especially \nsince the end of the war there has been a lot of sihiri, because of \nenvy among people; a man attacks a woman, people attack the \nharmony and the well-being of other households. I don\u201ft know who \ndoes it but there is a lot of sihiri. Maybe you won\u201ft believe it, but \nmany women come to me, and they do often divorce.  \n \nWell-being  \n \nIt depends, case from case, as to what is needed. This doesn\u201ft mean \na medical curing but healing with the Qur\u201fan. In this book [specific \nguidance concerning reading specific Qur\u201fanic verses for specific  \nhealing conditions] I usually find what is needed and then I take the \nQur\u201fan and pray with the Qur\u201fan. Look at this book, you can see \nwhich prayers are appropriate for particular illnesses or afflictions. \nFor example, today I am very busy because many young people are \npreparing for their exams and they might be very nervous and lacking \n 16 \nin confidence. But that\u201fs [Qur\u201fanic healing] something when you can\u201ft \ndrink any pill to calm you otherwise you would be sleepy and so on. \nEhh, and now, I do pray for her\/them to lose their nervousness, to \nliberate her\/themselves, and success, to pass the exams. However, it \ncan\u201ft help everybody, only for those who believe that I have such a \ncapacity to help.  \n \n \nThe Practice of dreaming and healing \n \nSadeta prays particular dove for her clients on her own choosing certain days \nand times, that is, between the fourth and the fifth prayer (Ak\u0161am-namaz and \nJacija-namaz), when she does remember the complete name of the person \nshe is praying for and then the particular prayer and again the following \nmorning when she does pray morning prayer (Sabah-namaz) in order to \nassure that her prayers will be received. Moreover, every Thursday evening, if \nshe is asked, she does pray surah Yasin for the soul of the dead persons.  \n \nSadeta\u201fs practice of istikhara itself is rather an obvious one. She does it as a \nnon-obligatory prayer during the night, when she usually wakes up during the \nnight about one a.m. and prays istikhara during which she remembers the \nperson she is praying for and subsequently goes to sleep again. Moreover, \nshe does remember the prayer and the person she prayed for again while she \nis already lying in her bed and then she does dream. However, she does not \nusually pray istikhara more often than twice a week, obviously on Friday and \nMonday as she wants to make sure that she will have a dream.  \n \nOverall, based on Sadeta\u201fs biography and dream narrative accounts Sadeta \nmay be considered as a sincere and committed istikhara healer anchored in \nthe Islamic tradition, which is however sanctioned by contemporary Imams \nand the hadiths with dreams being the only theologically sanctioned form of \ndivination in the Islamic tradition. Her practice is arguably rather simple and \nintuitive and without recourse to Islamic dream interpretation books such as \nthe ubiquitous (in Islamic countries and communities) Ibn Sireen volume for \n 17 \ninterpreting dream symbols. She does not refer to the language of orthodoxy, \nand to the Qur\u201fan only occasionally, and many if not most of the dream \nmessages were from her perceived dream guide, the handsome young man. \nAuditory dream messages were commonplace but sometimes human and \nnature symbols were interpreted as per human experience in reality, i.e. \nflowers, sheep and houses. Her practice of istikhara, generally, seems to be \npredominantly about marriage choice, a way to discern beneficial and long \nlasting futures involving many unpredictable future events and possibilities. \nHer clients come from all strata and corners of Bosnian society, though \nfemale  clients prevail.   \n \nHer skill as an istikhara practitioner has been seen by herself and her clients \nand some Imams as a gift from Allah. Her clients also experience her practice \nas helpful in dealing with misfortune, afflictions and with what Sadeta \ndescribes as the upsurge of sorcery cases in Bosnia since the 1992-5 war \nthere. Whilst previously istikhara practitioners Edgar has encountered in the \nUK, Turkey and Pakistan do the dream incubation practice for themselves or \ntheir immediate family, Sadeta\u201fs example shows that this practice is a kind of \nIslamic folk healing and moreover the recent emergence of advertisements for \nistikhara in Sarajevo popular magazines also shows that this has become a \nlay form of indigenous non-biomedical and Islamic spiritual form of arguably \nmental health healing or at least personal life choice guidance. There are \ncomparisons to be made with other forms of traditional folk and spirit based \nhealing traditions. \n \nConclusion: Islamic dreaming through ethnographic comparison  \nOverall, istikhara in both its practice of daytime guidance and night dream \ninterpretation appears to be a ubiquitous practice across Islamic lands. \nHowever, whilst there are common threads to this practice, for example extra \nIslamic prayers before retiring to bed; the divinatory understanding that dream \nimagery may well be related to future events in this world, the interpretation of \ndream imagery in part through a consideration as to how symbols, such as \nnature symbols, are empirically perceived in this world, our Bosnian case \nstudy well shows that such a possibly near universal Islamic healing practice \n 18 \nintersects with local folk custom and practice such as in relation to sorcery. \nDreaming and dream interpretation is embedded throughout the Islamic \nnarrative as a generative feature of enhanced human decision-making, \nparticularly through the inspirational example of the Prophet Mohammed. \nWell-being for many Moslems is conditional upon having a successful relation \nto their dream world in a not dissimilar way to Freud\u201fs well known dictum that \n\u201edreaming is the royal road to the unconscious\u201f or Jung\u201fs formulation of the  \nway of individuation as being related to the successful integration of \nunconscious processes, such as dream imagery, into consciousness. So, \nradically different secular and spiritual\/religious traditions and practices of \npsychological  well-being are similarly orientated to the unseen, by the outer \neye, hinterlands of the self.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAllen, D. 2006.
