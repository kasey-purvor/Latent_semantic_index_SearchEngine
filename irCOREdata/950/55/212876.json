[120 words] \n \nKey words: Fear of crime; emotion; resilience; neighbourhood disorder \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n\u2018In line with the political interests responsible for the emergence of fear of crime as a \nmajor research issue in the 1970s and early 1980s, fear has been treated, almost \ninvariably, in criminological research as an extremely negative aspect of people\u2019s \nlives, as something that adversely affects and greatly diminishes the quality of life. \nHardly any attention was given to the positive aspects and positive consequences of \nfear. There has hardly been any talk about fear as a healthy emotion, as a necessary \nmechanism of survival, of self-preservation, of avoiding risk and minimizing danger\u2026 \nAnd yet, if it is true that fear and caution go hand in hand, if prudence is the response \nto fear, and if it is true that fear leads to lower victimization, then fear might be a \npositive mobilizing force that could be harnessed to achieve utilitarian goals.\u2019 (Fattah, \n1993: 66)  \n \nThis analysis was telling some fifteen years ago, and it remains so to this day. Surveys in \ncountries across the world regularly find widespread public anxieties over the threat of crime \n(Ferraro, 1995; Van Kesteren et al., 2000). Fear of crime might only shadow the actual incidence \nof crime, but it certainly seems to damage psychological well-being, decrease collective trust and \ncohesion, and tempt politicians towards populist rhetoric and punitive policy (Skogan, 1986; \nHale, 1996; Warr, 2000; Dolan and Peasgood, 2007; Stafford et al., 2007; Jackson and Stafford, \n2009). Such is the extent of the problem that governments in a number of different countries seek \nto reduce fear of crime \u2013 presumably wherever it is to be found.  \n Yet might some level of worry about crime be a \u2018good thing\u2019 (Fattah, 1993; Hale, 1996; \nWarr, 2000; Ditton and Innes, 2005)? For Solomon (2006: 29):  \n \n\u2018Without fear, we would allow ourselves to be vulnerable to all sorts of dangers, and we \nwould recklessly face lethal situations without hesitation and without a thought of the \npossible disastrous consequences.\u2019  \n \nFor Sacco (2005: 138): \u2018The opposite of fearfulness may not be fearlessness, but recklessness.\u2019 \nPsychologists have long recognised the problem-solving function of worry in the anticipation of \nfuture problems and risks (Tallis et al., 1994; Gladstone and Parker, 2003). If we could turn a \n\u2018magic dial\u2019 to control or regulate public worries about crime, would we want to eliminate fear of \ncrime altogether (Warr, 2000)? Might decreasing public insecurities inadvertently reduce \npeople\u2019s nature defences against crime?  \n This paper extends the fear of crime concept to include the notion of \u2018functional fear.\u2019 \nOver the years, criminologists have argued that fear of crime encompasses a wealth of \nperceptions, reactions and vulnerabilities (Sparks, 1992; Skogan, 1993; Fattah, 1993; Hale, 1996; \nHollway and Jefferson, 1997; Lee, 2001; Gabriel and Greve, 2003; Vanderveen, 2007). \nQualitative research has highlighted the dense, rich and shifting cultural significance of crime \n(Taylor and Jamieson, 1998; Girling et al. 2000), addressed the psycho-social aspects of \nindividual anxieties (Hollway and Jefferson, 1997), analysed how females manage safety and \nstructure their lives around precautionary behaviour (Pain, 1997; Madriz, 1997; Hollander, 2001; \nStanko, 1990), and shed light on how males experience \u2018being feared\u2019 (Day, 2006). Recent \nquantitative work (Jackson, 2004; Farrall et al., 2009; see also Gray et al., 2008a, 2008b) has also \ndifferentiated between an everyday worry (those concrete emotions that result from feeling \npersonally threatened) and a more diffuse\/ambient anxiety (a more common feeling of \ngeneralised risk and the sense that \u2018it could happen\u2019; cf. Jackson, 2006). \n The study has two goals. The first is to establish whether fear can be a motivating force \nthat encourages vigilance and stimulates precautionary activity (cf. Liska & Warner, 1991). \nDrawing upon data from a representative-sample survey of residents of seven diverse London \nElectoral Wards, we find that around one-quarter of those individuals who said they were worried \nabout crime, also viewed their worry as something akin to a problem-solving activity. They took \n 4 \nprecautions; these precautions made them feel safer; and neither the precautions nor the worries \nabout crime reduced the quality of their lives. In such circumstances \u2018fear\u2019 might be seen less as a \ndamaging retreat into the role of a potential victim and more as a beneficial strategy of risk \nmanagement \u2013 a problem-solving activity. The second goal is to establish whether key correlates \ndiffer depending on whether worry about crime is classified as either functional or dysfunctional. \nWe find that victimisation experience is related to dysfunctional worry but not with functional \nworry, and that social concerns (about neighbourhood disorder and levels of collective efficacy) \nare strongly associated with both functional and dysfunctional worry about crime. \nThe paper begins with current criminological thinking on the routinisation of crime and \nrisk in public life. We then consider some conditions under which worry might be seen as a \u2018good \nthing\u2019 (motivating a protective activity against future harm) and as a \u2018bad thing\u2019 (a drain on well-\nbeing and quality of life). This leads to the findings of the study, and while our results can say \nlittle about the \u2018fit\u2019 between objective and subjective risk, the evidence presented does suggest \nthat criminal justice practitioners, media pundits and social scientists alike should not interpret all \ninstances of \u2018fear\u2019 as evidence of a social problem. Attempts to reduce \u2018fear\u2019 (whatever \u2018it\u2019 is, and \nwherever \u2018it\u2019 is to be found) might unwittingly reduce people\u2019s natural defences to crime. \n \nThe prominent place of crime in everyday life \nGarland (2001: 147) argues that crime has become a \u2018normal social fact\u2019 in the US and the UK, \nsomething:  \n \n\u2018\u2026constituted for, and lived by, social situated individuals who inhabit the \ncomplex of practices, knowledges, norms, and subjectivities that make up a culture. \nIt is a collective cultural experience, one that weaves its threads of meaning into \nevery individual encounter, and is, in turn, inflected and revised by the thousands \nof such encounters that take place every day..\u2019  \n \nOne of a number of influences on the growing social significance of crime is the increasing \nimportance placed on so-called \u2018responsibilisation\u2019 in contemporary crime control strategies \n(Garland, 1996, 2001). The new methods of responsibilisation involve central government \nseeking to act upon crime, not in a direct fashion but by indirectly encouraging action from non-\nstate agencies, communities and individual households. \u2018Active citizens\u2019 help set up \nneighbourhood watch programmes, they buy various security products, and they take numerous \npreventative measures to protect themselves from crime. Heralding a new focus on crime \nprevention and control, the 1990s saw a vibrant insurance industry emerging, contractually \nrequiring policyholders to employ strategies for reducing the likelihood of victimisation (Feeley \nand Simon, 1992; cf. O\u2019Malley and Hutchinson, 2007).  \nFeeley and Simon (1992) have suggested that the growing dominance of actuarial styles \nof governance and criminal justice from the 1990\u2019s has superseded other models of governance \nsuch as welfare and disciplinary forms of regulation. Their recognition of a \u2018new penology\u2019 \ninvolves measures designed to locate, organize and manage risks, whereby precautionary actions \nhave become as important as criminal justice system responses to harms done (Feeley and Simon, \n1994; O\u2019Malley, 2001). Meanwhile, Clarke\u2019s environmental crime prevention theory suggests \nthat by reducing crime opportunities and employing more sophisticated prevention strategies \u2013 as \nopposed to trying to address the characteristics of criminals or the social causes of crime \u2013 \npatterns of criminal activity could be reduced. Using statistical data, criminal justice agencies \ncould target vulnerable areas (Clarke, 1995), and education about risk and precaution could \nencourage individuals to reduce the opportunities for crime in their neighbourhood.  \n The adaptive reactions of individuals, households and communities to this growing \nemphasis on personal responsibility for crime prevention have led to a proliferation of \ncommercial products, such as car, house and rape \u2018alarms\u2019, bolts, locks and entry phones, \n 5 \nremovable car stereos and CCTV. Many people \u2013 especially women \u2013 have adopted behavioural \nstrategies that seek to minimise their personal risk of crime (cf. Stanko, 1990). Examples might \ninclude hiding valuables, leaving lights on in an empty house, not opening doors to unannounced \nvisitors, or modifying activities in public spaces. Other groups of people take similar evasive \naction, with older people and city dwellers alike avoiding parks after dark or town centres late at \nnight (see Pain, 1997). Qualitative studies have described the \u2018mental maps\u2019 of localities that \nindividuals use to represent and avoid certain areas (e.g. Taylor, 1996, Taylor and Jamieson, \n1998).  \n \nTwo sides to the everyday risk of crime \nYet while the routine management of risk has received little empirical interest in fear of crime \nresearch, it is plausible that (for some people at least) these behaviours have become functional \nconsiderations that are subsumed into their everyday routines. Loader and Walker (2007: 160) \nhighlight the favourability of this scenario:  \n \n\u2018It follows that we typically aspire to a situation where our monitoring of our security \nenvironment may be a highly tacit and routine affair, an activity which takes place \nlargely at the level of \u201cpractical\u201d rather than \u201cdiscursive consciousness\u201d (Giddens \n1984); one where we rarely feel it necessary to peep round the veil of our security \ncover, and our checks when we do so need only be cursory.\u2019  \n \nDespite the attention given by criminologists over the last two decades to precautionary \nactivity and \u2018responsibilisation\u2019, public perceptions of the risk of crime have been studied through \na singular lens. Treating fear of crime as only a series of negative emotions (that erode public \nhealth and drain community cohesion and social trust) ignores the possibility that the full gamut \nof emotional responses to risk includes an emotion that motivates rather than damages \u2013 an \nemotion that stimulates sensible precaution. Again, Garland (2001: 155-156):  \n \n\u2018For some, the crime problem has become a source of anxiety and frustration; an \nurgent daily reminder of the need to impose control, to take care, to secure oneself \nand one\u2019s family against the dangers of the modern world. Anxieties of this kind \nare often mixed with anger and resentment and, when experienced en masse, can \nsupply the emotional basis for retaliatory laws and expressive punishments. At the \nopposite end of the spectrum, other individuals react with measured stoicism, \ninuring themselves to crime\u2019s irritations and risks, adapting to this \u201cfact of life\u201d in \nthe same humdrum way that they adapt to the daily grind of commuting, or the \ntendency of the cost of living to risk..\u2019  \n \n\u2018Slicing up\u2019 the fear of crime into the functional and the dysfunctional \nEmotion may help generate stoicism and adaptation to crime as a \u2018fact of life.\u2019 From Aristotle to \nLocke to Burke, philosophers have seen fear as a motivating force without which the human \npopulace remains passive and satiated. Emotion is not necessarily the sand in the machinery of \nrationality (Elster, 1999): triggering a rapid response, emotion can improve the quality and \nefficiency of cognition. Enabling us to deal quickly with encountered problems, emotion \ninterrupts ongoing attention and directs us to the emotion-eliciting event (Levenson, 1994).  \nThought and feeling may even be inseparable: \u2018\u2026like the convex and concave sides of an \narc \u2013 dissociable for analytical purposes but not to be reified into distinct (even if interacting) \nsystems\u2019 (Averill, 2004: 579). Indeed psychologists have long highlighted the problem-solving \nand motivational character of worry. Consider Gladstone and Parker\u2019s (2003: 347) review:  \n \n 6 \n\u2018As a phenomenon, worry can range from an innocuous activity possibly associated \nwith positive consequences (i.e. solution finding), through to a distressing and \nuncontrollable process like the excessive and chronic worry recognised as the \ncardinal feature of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). It has been defined broadly \nas repetitive thought activity, which is usually negative and frequently related to \nfeared future outcomes or events.\u2019 \n \nIn a study into the phenomenology of \u2018normal\u2019 worry, Tallis et al. (1994) found that when \nthinking about their general life concerns, many individuals considered worry to be a routine and \nmostly acceptable activity that occurred more or less daily, was addressed towards various issues, \nand transpired mostly in the form of thoughts with a narrative course. Worry was typically \nassociated with real-life triggers, was both present and future-orientated, and was focused upon \nproblems which were real or likely rather than imaginary or remote. Worry was also seen to have \nbenefits through its stimulation to action. That the majority of subjects perceived their worry as a \nproblem-solving activity suggests that the worry process helps some people cope with an \nuncertain future to help avoid negative possible events. \n On the other hand worry can have clear negative effects, with Tallis et al.\u2019s (1994) study \nshowing a range of deleterious cognitive (e.g. pessimism, problem exaggeration) and affective \n(e.g. emotional discomfort, depression) consequences to worry. Among the features of \u2018high\u2019 \nworriers were more frequent episodes of worry (at least daily); greater difficulty in stopping \nworrying; rebounding worries; and mood disturbance and perceived impairment in everyday \nfunctioning. \u2018High\u2019 worriers also reported greater indecision and doubt when worrying; and they \nwere more likely to perceive worry as having a negative effect on their health.  \nGiven such insights, we might wonder under what conditions worry about crime can be \nseen as either functional (with positive consequences) or dysfunctional (with negative \nconsequences). These are choppy waters, of course. But according to Solomon (2006: 174): \n \n\u2018The causes, context and circumstances of the emotion . . . are all too often confused \nwith the emotion itself. For example, fear is typically considered a negative emotion, \nthat is, a bad emotion, on the grounds that the circumstances provoking fear tend to be \nthreatening to one\u2019s well being. (Indeed, many theorists would take this to be a matter \nof definition). But it does not follow from the fact that the circumstances that provoke \nfear are bad for us that the emotion of fear is bad for us. The circumstances may be bad \nfor us, but fear, as I argued, is good for us, at least when it is appropriate fear.\u2019 \n \nOur approach \nIn defining when worry about crime is \u2018good for us,\u2019 our classification model takes three steps:  \n \n\u2022 First, measure worry about crime using standard intensity measures (e.g. \u2018How worried are \nyou about being burgled?\u2019 very, fairly, not very, not at all);  \n\u2022 Second, if individuals who say they are fairly or very worried also report that their quality of \nlife is reduced by either their worries or their precautions against crime, then assign these \nindividuals to the dysfunctionally worried group; and, \n\u2022 Third, if individuals who say they are fairly or very worried also report that they take \nprecautions that make them feel safer, and neither worry nor precaution reduces their quality \nof life, then assign these individuals to the functionally worried group.  \n \nOur approach assumes that worry can motivate beneficial action. We reason that emotion can \noperate as a problem-solving activity that leads individuals to take steps to manage their sense of \nthe risk of falling victim. We also place centre-stage people\u2019s own perspectives on their emotions \nand actions. People may take precautions; they may feel that these precautions make them feel \n 7 \nsafer; and they may feel that their quality of life is not harmed by either their precautions or their \nworries. In each case the individual in question is best placed to take a view on his or her \nbehaviours, as well as to understand the effects of his or her behaviours and worries on quality of \nlife.  \n \u2018Functional fear\u2019 may thus be exhibited when people say they are worried about crime. \nBut what they mean is that they see a risk of crime; that this perception generates a sense of \ninsecurity; that their behavioural response helps them manage this insecurity; and crucially, that \ntheir quality of life is unharmed by either these emotions or these behavioural adaptations. We \nwill return in the closing of this paper to two complicating issues in our definition of functional \nfear. These are important; they regard the \u2018appropriateness\u2019 of emotion and the \u2018hidden costs\u2019 of \nworry and precautionary activity. But the first task is to establish the phenomenon.  \nSo let us begin by establishing whether some people\u2019s worry about crime (which would \notherwise be classified as negative in consequence) might be seen in a more positive light than \nhas thus far been displayed. Once this stage has been completed, we can then assess some \nempirical implications of the new categorisation. We establish whether key correlates of worry \nabout crime \u2013 victimisation experience and public concerns about neighbourhood disorder and \ncollective efficacy \u2013 correlate differently with the functional worry and dysfunctional worry. But \nfirst, to the phenomenon of functional and dysfunctional fear of crime. \n \nThe Study \n \nMethod \nThe 2007 Safer Neighbourhoods Survey obtained data from 2,844 residents in 7 London electoral \nwards, with around 400 respondents from each of Angels Park North, Myddleton Green, \nHennington, Aylesford North, Staniford, Newriver and Lowervale (the wards have been given \npseudonyms). Respondents were selected using a three-stage sample selection process within \neach ward:  \n \n\u2022 random probability sampling of household addresses; \n\u2022 the random selection of a dwelling unit in cases where a single address included more \nthan one unit; and, \n\u2022 the random selection of an adult to be targeted for interview in cases where a \nhousehold contained more than one adult. \n \nThe overall response rate was 42% (ranging from 28% in Staniford to 57% in Angels Park \nNorth). While these electoral wards constitute a relatively diverse cross-section of London in \nterms of deprivation, crime and geographical spread, the focus of this study is not on area-level \neffects but is instead on the broader phenomenon of functional fear. \n \nMeasuring worry about crime \nRespondents were asked how worried they were about falling victim of each of six different \ncrime-types: (a) burglary, (b) mugging\/robbery, (c) being physically attacked in the street by a \nstranger, (d) being insulted and harassed in the street, (e) being raped, and (f) being subject to \nphysical attack because of skin colour, ethnic origin or religion.1 The first step of the \n                                                 \n1\n While all respondents were asked about rape, this act clearly has different significance for men and women. We \ntreated all male respondent scores as missing data, meaning that worry about rape only made a contribution to the index \nfor females (we used Full Informational Maximum Likelihood (FIML) estimation instead of listwise and pairwise \ndeletion methods to draw on as much information as possible). Racial attack has different significance for different \nethnic groups, but it is possible that individuals who identify themselves as White British (for example) think they \ncould be victimised on the basis of their religion or ethnic origin. The meaning of racial attack might therefore be closer \n 8 \nclassification procedure was to recode these six variables, where zero meant \u2018not at all worried\u2019 \nand \u2018not very worried\u2019, and one meant \u2018fairly worried\u2019 and \u2018very worried.\u2019 We used latent class \nanalysis (LCA) to combine these six recoded indicators into one dichotomous variable, since the \nmanifest variables were categorical and since we assumed that the underlying latent variable to be \ncategorical (we made this assumption for reasons of convenience with respect to the broader \nclassification procedure),. A two-class model was tested using Full Information Maximum \nLikelihood (FIML) estimation in LatentGold 4.0 (which includes all available information in the \nestimation procedure). The model allocated 72% of the sample into class one (with probabilities \nof not worrying about burglary, mugging, attack, harassment, rape and racial attack of 0.89, 0.89, \n0.92, 0.89, 0.78 and 0.82 respectively) and 28% of the sample into class two (with probabilities of \nworrying about burglary, mugging, attack, harassment, rape and racial attack of 0.55, 0.69, 0.91, \n0.88, 0.87 and 0.89 respectively). A dichotomous variable was then derived that identified the \nmodal category, thus categorising each respondent as either \u2018worried about crime\u2019 or \u2018not worried \nabout crime.\u2019 The data were then exported to Stata for the proceeding statistical analysis. \n \nMeasuring the impact on quality of life \nRespondents were also asked whether their quality of life was affected first by their worries about \ncrime, and second by their precautions they took to guard against crime. The response alternatives \nprovided were \u2018not at all\u2019, \u2018a little\u2019, \u2018moderately\u2019, \u2018quite a bit\u2019 and \u2018very much.\u2019 As with worry \nabout crime, a dichotomous variable was constructed. But this time it denoted whether or not \ntheir quality of life was diminished by their worries and\/or their precautions. As before, LCA was \nused.2  \n \nMeasuring precautions and their impact on perceived safety \nTo measure precautions against crime, respondents were asked how often (if at all) they avoided \nusing public transport, avoided certain streets or areas during the day, and avoided certain streets \nor areas at night (each as a result of the risk of crime). A dichotomous variable was constructed to \ndenote whether an individual took precautions or not. Respondents were also questioned: \u2018As a \nresult of the precautions you take against crime, to what extent do you feel safer?\u2019 The response \nalternatives provided were: \u2018not at all\u2019, \u2018a little\u2019, \u2018moderately\u2019, \u2018quite a bit\u2019 and \u2018very much.\u2019 This \nvariable was dichotomised, where zero equalled \u2018not at all\u2019 and one equalled \u2018a little\u2019, \n\u2018moderately\u2019, \u2018quite a bit\u2019 or \u2018very much.\u2019  \n \nResults \n \nA new categorisation of worry of crime \nThe first task was to empirically identify the three worry groups: \n \n1. \u2018unworried\u2019; \n2. \u2018functionally worried\u2019; and, \n3. \u2018dysfunctionally worried\u2019.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                 \nacross ethnicity than rape might be across gender. Racially motivated crime was consequently included in the index for \nall respondents. We acknowledge that this is a rather contentious issue. \n2\n First, the two variables were dichotomised: zero meant \u2018not at all\u2019 or \u2018a little\u2019; and one meant \u2018moderately\u2019, \u2018quite a \nbit\u2019 or \u2018very much.\u2019 Second, latent class modelling using FIML estimation produced a two class model (using \nLatentGold 4.0) that differentiated between 60% of the sample who fell into class one (with probabilities of no impact \non quality of life of worries and precautions of 0.86 and 0.89 respectively) and 40% of the sample who fell into class \ntwo (with probabilities of having an impact on quality of life of worries and precautions of 0.91 and 0.88 respectively). \nThird, a new dichotomous variable was derived from this analysis. \n 9 \nFirst, individuals were classified as unworried if they reported being unworried about \ncrime: it did not matter if they took precautions that made them feel safer, or if their quality of life \nwas reduced by their precautions; if they reported being unworried they were simply classified as \nunworried.  \nTo be classified in the functional worry group, respondents must have met three \nconditions: (a) they must have reported being worried about crime; (b) they must have taken \nprecautions that made them feel safer; and (c) they must have judged their quality of life \nunaffected by either their worries or their precautions. Importantly, we assume that the worry \nprocess partly motivates these beneficial precautions; as Tallis & Eysenck (1994) argue, worry \ncan play a problem-solving role in people\u2019s lives by stimulating action and helping them deal \nwith uncertain future events. Finally, to be classified in the dysfunctional worry group, \nrespondents must have reported being worried about crime but also that their quality of life was \nreduced by either their worries or their precautions (or both).3   \nTo generate the three groups, Tables 1 and 2 break down the sample. Overall 73% (n = \n2,019) of respondents were unworried. The other two categories \u2013 functional worry and \ndysfunctional worry \u2013 are subsets of the remaining 27% (n = 825). Of these 27%, 17% (n = 140) \ntook no precautions, 66% (n = 548) took precautions and felt safer as a result, and 17% (n = 137) \ntook precautions but did not feel safer as a result (Table 1).  \n \nINSERT TABLE ONE ABOUT HERE \n \nTable 2 takes the categorisation process one step further. The focus here is on two further \nsubsets of those who are worried about crime: (a) those who took precautions and felt safer as a \nresult of these precautions (71% of the worried group); and (b) those who did not take \nprecautions, and those who did take precautions but did not feel safer a result (29% of the worried \ngroup). We make this distinction because of the central role that beneficial precautionary activity \nplays in the functional\/dysfunctional distinction. By cross-tabulating these two groups with levels \nof impact on quality of life, we can identify the functionally worried and the dysfunctionally \nworried. The cell to highlight is top-left (Table 2). This represents the functionally worried \u2013 the \nsubset of the sample who were worried about crime, who took precautions that made them feel \nsafer, and whose quality of life was not reduced by either worry or precaution. The other three \ncells comprise the dysfunctional worry group.  \n  \nINSERT TABLE TWO ABOUT HERE \n \nBringing this classification process to a close, we found that around three-quarters (73%) \nof the sample were unworried, one-in-twelve (8%) were functional worried, and one-in-five \n(20%) were dysfunctional worried (Table 3). \n \nINSERT TABLE THREE ABOUT HERE \n \nCorrelates of functional and dysfunctional worry  \nNow we have documented the proportions of the sample that fell into the three worry about crime \ngroups, our next step was to explore the new categorisation in more detail. More specifically, we  \nassessed whether functional and dysfunctional worry had meaning beyond descriptive distinction. \nWe tested the extent to which they were differently associated with key fear of crime correlates. \n                                                 \n3\n A very small number of people said they were worried and said that their quality of life was unaffected by worries and \nprecautions, but also said that the precautions they took did not make them feel safer. We placed these individuals in \nthe dysfunctionally worried group, since we reason that the perceived positive effect of precaution is central to the \ndefinition of functional fear. \n 10 \nWe examined the effects of i) victimisation and ii) public concerns about neighbourhood disorder \nand collective efficacy. But before presenting the findings we should first motivate the driving \nhypotheses.  \n \nVictimisation and neighbourhood perception in fear of crime \nIn the following multivariate analyses we test two propositions. First, we test whether individuals \nwho have recently fallen victim of crime are more likely to exhibit dysfunctional rather than \nfunctional worry. Second, we test the effects of anxiety about neighbourhood disorder and\/ or \npoor social cohesion and informal social control.  In sum, we predict that when individuals have \nrecently experienced crime, and when individuals view their social environment as unstable, they \nwill not only be more likely to be worried about future harm; their worry will also be more likely \nto damage their quality of life and sense of well-being. \nThe evidence on the role of crime-experience in fear of crime is so far mixed (Hale, \n1996). There is some suggestion of a link between direct victimisation experience and worry \nabout crime (e.g. Garofalo, 1979; Skogan, 1981; Stafford and Galle, 1984; Covington and Taylor, \n1991; McCoy et al., 1996; Kury and Ferdinand, 1998; Rountree, 1998). Yet direct experience of \ncrime seems but a small part of any powerful explanation of the fear of crime.   \nThere are two main reasons for the (at best) weak association between victimisation and \nworry about crime. The first is that legal (and survey) definitions of victimisation tend to exclude \nunpleasant experiences such as intimidation, obscene phone calls and sexual harassment that \nmight be relevant to public concerns about safety and security. Identity-related victimisation (i.e. \ncrime committed because of the gender, sexuality, race or other such attribute of the victim) is \ndealt with only cursorily in much of the fear of crime literature. Kelly (1987, 1988) and Phillips \n(1999, 2000) discuss the complexities of unwanted behaviour and daily harassment for women, \nwith a \u2018continuum of violence\u2019 (Kelly, 1987) placing relatively minor acts of abuse at one end \n(\u2018flashing\u2019 and minor forms of sexual abuse) and acts like rape at the other end (see also Stanko, \n1990, 1997; Gardner, 1990; Pain, 1997, 1997; Madriz, 1997; Hollander, 2001, 2002). Even minor \nacts may be fear-provoking as these remind women of the possibility of more serious forms of \nviolence. This may also extend to non-gender related issues of victimisation and the occupation \nof the public space by aggressive individuals. \nSecond, victimisation may demystify the unknown by showing the mundane nature of \nmany experiences of crime. Victimisation might be neutralised by victims in the same way that \noffenders negate feelings of guilt (Agnew, 1985; see also Hale, 1996 and Winkel, 1998). Tyler \nand Rasinski (1984) surveyed crime victims and found that perceptions of risk and worry about \nfuture victimization was associated with both what individuals learnt from their particular \nexperience of crime and the emotional reactions they had to the experience.   \nIn this paper we explore the possibility of a third: that the weak correlation between \nvictimisation and fear of crime is partly related to conceptual and methodological limitations, \nmore specifically to the failure to disentangle functional and dysfunctional worry. Studies \ntypically measure worry about crime using standard intensity measures (\u2018How worried are you \nabout being burgled?). But if previous estimates of worry about crime have \u2018lumped together\u2019 \ntwo different experiences, then unpacking these experiences might reveal that victimisation \nexperience has a stronger effect on the dysfunctional type of worry than previously seen or \nassumed. While for functional worry, it may be that victimisation experience has only a weak or \neven no statistical effect.  \nWe also hypothesise that public concerns about social cohesion, consensus and \norganisation will be stronger predictors of dysfunctional worry than of functional worry. We \ndistinguish in this study between perceived neighbourhood disorder, and perceived social \ncohesion and perceived informal social control (which we combine to create perceived collective \nefficacy). Ferraro (1995) found that perception of disorder predicted fear of crime, and that most \nof the statistical effect was mediated through public perceptions of the likelihood of victimisation. \n 11 \nThis finding \u2013 that disorder provides ecological information that shapes citizens\u2019 perceptions of \nthe chances of victimization \u2013 has been replicated in UK research (Farrall et al., 2009; cf Skogan \nand Maxfield, 1981; Wilson and Kelling, 1982; Smith, 1986; Lewis and Salem, 1986; Taylor and \nHale, 1986; Skogan, 1990; Covington and Taylor 1991; LaGrange et al., 1992; Perkins and \nTaylor, 1996; Rountree and Land 1996a, 1996b; Taylor, 1999; Innes, 2004; Robinson et al., \n2003).  \nPerceptions of social cohesion and informal social control have also been found to predict \nperceptions of risk and worry about crime net of perceptions of neighbourhood disorder (Jackson, \n2004).4 This suggests that worry about crime is stimulated by weak informal provisions of social \ncontrol: if local social controls are not seen to have been exerted, then a sense of insecurity may \nbe engendered. One can further combine perception of social cohesion and perception of informal \nsocial control to produce a measure of \u2018collective efficacy\u2019 (Sampson et al., 1997; Bursik, 1988; \nBursik and Grasmick, 1993; Sampson and Raudenbush, 1999). Following recent research, we \npredict separate influences on worry about crime of (a) concerns about disorder and (b) concerns \nabout collective efficacy. We predict that dysfunctional worry emerges most often \u2013 compared to \ni) functional worry and ii) not being worried \u2013 when people view their neighbourhood to lack the \nability to realise the common values of residents and maintain effective social controls (which in \nturn depends on mutual trust and solidarity among neighbours). \n \nMeasuring victimisation experience \nVictimisation experience was measured by asking whether or not respondents had been a victim \nof crime in the last 12 months.  \n \nMeasuring neighbourhood perception \nNeighbourhood perception was broken down into: (a) perception of disorder; (b) perception of \nsocial cohesion; and (c) perception of informal social control. Perceived disorder was measured \nby asking respondents: \u2018Here is a list of issues that may or may not be a problem in this area. For \neach one please tell me whether it is a major problem, a minor problem or no problem.\u2019 \n \n\u2022 Litter, fly tipping and fly posting; \n\u2022 Graffiti; \n\u2022 Vandalism, for instance of telephone kiosks or bus shelters; \n\u2022 Noisy and\/or nuisance neighbours; \n\u2022 Noisy\/rowdy\/inconsiderate behaviour in the street; \n\u2022 Teenagers hanging around in the street; and, \n\u2022 Drinking in the street. \n \nPerception of social cohesion was measured by asking respondents whether they agreed or \ndisagreed (using a 5-point scale) with the following statements: \n \n\u2022 People around here are willing to help their neighbours; \n\u2022 This is a close-knit neighbourhood; and, \n\u2022 People in this neighbourhood can be trusted. \n \nPerception of informal social control was measured by asking respondents whether they agreed or \ndisagreed (using a 5-point scale) with the following statements: \n \n                                                 \n4\n Indeed, disorder may actually generate information to observers about the state of informal social cohesion (see study \ntwo of Jackson & Bradford, 2009). \n 12 \n\u2022 If I sensed trouble whilst in this area, I could \u2018raise\u2019 attention from people who live here \nfor help; \n\u2022 The people who live here can be relied upon to call the police if someone is acting \nsuspiciously; and, \n\u2022 If any of the children or young people around here are causing trouble, local people will \ntell them off. \n \nLatent Gold 4.0 was used to derive a single index for each of these neighbourhood \nperceptions (disorder, social cohesion and collective efficacy). Latent trait analysis is a statistical \ntechnique used to assess the underlying dimensionality of sets of ordinal variables that are \nexpected to load on continuous-level latent variables. As in previous analyses, we used FIML to \nretain as much information as possible. Because the indices of social cohesion and informal social \ncontrol were highly correlated (r=0.585, p<.001) the individual indicators of cohesion and \nefficacy were combined into one index, again using latent trait analysis.5 This creates a scale of \npublic perception of collective efficacy. Collective efficacy is the linkage of (a) mutual trust and \nshared expectations among residents, and (b) the shared willingness to intervene to defend social \norder. To facilitate comparison and to aid interpretation, all neighbourhood perception variables \nwere recoded to range from 0 to 10, with high scores equalling relatively strong concerns about \nlocal disorder and collective efficacy. \nHaving considered the important debates regarding the role of victimisation and \nneighbourhood perceptions in the fear of crime, we can proceed more formally to assess the \nstrength of their relationship with functional and dysfunctional fear. First, we estimate a \nmultinomial logistic regression model with fixed effects (Table 4).6 The purpose of considering \nthis model is to provide an assessment of whether different values in the explanatory variables are \nassociated with different odds (or chances, probabilities, likelihood) of falling into each of the \nthree worry groups. \n  \nINSERT TABLE FOUR ABOUT HERE \n \nStarting with demographic factors, Table 4 shows that females had greater odds of having \nboth functional and dysfunctional worry \u2013 compared to being unworried \u2013 than males. The odds \nratio of 1.485 in the contrast between unworried and dysfunctional worry (p<0.001) meant that \nthe odds of being dysfunctional worried \u2013 compared to being unworried \u2013 were 48.5% higher for \nfemales than they are for males. The 95% confidence interval indicates that our estimate of the \nodds ratio in the population is somewhere between 1.334 and 1.653. Next, the odds ratio of 1.604 \n(95% confidence interval of 1.024, 2.513) in the contrast between unworried and functionally \nworried (p=0.002) meant that the odds of being functionally worried \u2013 compared to being \nunworried \u2013 were 60.4% higher for females that they were for males. Age was not a statistically \nsignificant predictor in the model; there was no linear or curvilinear effect of age; and there was \nno statistical interaction between gender and age. \nIn addition, recent victimisation experience was associated with greater odds of being \ndysfunctional worried compared to being unworried (odds ratio of 1.778, so the odds of being in \nthe dysfunctional compared to the unworried group were 77.8% greater for victims compared to \nnon-victims in our sample). But victimisation experience was not associated with greater odds of \n                                                 \n5\n Please contact the first author for more details.  \n6\n Because the data were clustered (an average of 400 individuals within each of the 7 electoral wards) and because the \narea-level variance was statistically significant in a random intercepts multinomial logistic regression (in empty as well \nas full models, showing heterogeneity of worry about crime between the 7 areas even after taking into account \nindividual characteristics), we estimated a fixed effects multinomial logistic regression model. It is important to include \nfixed effects not just to estimate correct standard errors, but also to wash out the effect of neighbourhood on the \noutcome of interest, which here is membership of the three worry about crime groups. \n 13 \nbeing functionally worried (p=0.507). This supports our hypothesis that victimisation experience \nis a factor behind dysfunctional worry but not a factor behind functional worry. It suggests that \nthe experience of crime is one of the things that pushes worry about crime from a motivating \nexperience into a damaging experience in and of itself. \nWe then examined whether perceptions of neighbourhood disorder and collective \nefficacy predicted membership of the three worry groups. We hypothesised that neighbourhood \nconcerns will be more strongly associated with dysfunctional worry than with functional worry: a \ndisorderly social and physical environment may lead individuals to worry about crime and take \nprecautions about crime in a manner that damages their quality of life. Contrary to expectations \nhowever, this hypothesis was not supported by the data (Table 4). Perception of neighbourhood \ndisorder was a key predictor of both functional and dysfunctional worry (p<0.001 and p<0.001 \nrespectively), and indeed the effect sizes (captured by the two odds ratios) were almost identical. \nConcerns about collective efficacy also predicted dysfunctional and functional worry, and again \nthe effect sizes were roughly equal.  \nWe finish with an alternative way of presenting the findings (Table 5). A binary logistic \nregression model estimated a direct comparison between the functional and the dysfunctional \ngroups (without reference to the unworried as in Table 4). In line with the analyses reported \nabove, victimisation experience was a statistically significant predictor of dysfunctional worry \ncompared to functional worry (p=0.050), and perceptions of disorder and cohesion\/efficacy were \nnot statistically significant predictors of dysfunctional compared to functional worry (p=0.854 \nand p=0.552 respectively).  \n \nDiscussion \nTo summarise the findings of our study, 73% of the sample were unworried about crime, 20% \nwere dysfunctionally worried about crime, and 8% were functionally worried about crime. \nConsequently, while around one-quarter of individuals expressed some level of worry about \ncrime, one-quarter of these individuals exhibited a kind of emotional experience more akin to a \nmotivating and problem-solving activity. They took precautions; they felt safer as a result; and \ntheir quality of life was unaffected by worries and precautions. Previous research has treated any \nincidence of fear of crime as a contribution to the aggregate estimate of fear of crime as a social \nproblem across society. Yet this study suggests that the social problem status has been \nexaggerated \u2013 not everyone experienced their worry as a damaging and draining force. \nWe also assessed two predictive factors for functional and dysfunctional worry about \ncrime. We found that victimisation experience was associated with dysfunctional worry but not \nwith functional worry. We thus have some early evidence that recent experience of crime helps \n\u2018tip\u2019 worry about crime from something that is motivational (functional) into something that \nerodes well-being and quality of life (dysfunctional). Of interest to the rationality debate in the \nfear of crime (is \u2018fear\u2019 out of kilter to \u2018crime\u2019?) was the finding that dysfunctional worry was \nmore strongly related to actual crime experiences than previously shown in empirical research. \nEqually, fear of crime is an expressive as well as experiential phenomenon, with previous \nresearch suggesting that worry about crime is wrapped up in broader social concerns about \nneighbourhood breakdown, as well as more diffuse anxieties about social change and the decline \nof moral authority in society (Girling et al., 2000; Jackson, 2006; Hirtenlehner, 2008; Farrall et \nal., 2009). The idea here is that fear of crime emerges when people view there to be an erosion of \nthe values that keep public behaviour in check. Contributing to this debate, the current study \nfound that perception of neighbourhood disorder and collective efficacy were important \npredictors of both functional and dysfunctional worry. This suggests that functional and \ndysfunctional worry are equally expressive of these more everyday social concerns; local issues \nof social order may thus generate similar patterns of emotional and behavioural responses to the \nperceived risk of crime. \n 14 \nOne opportunity for future research is the role of a psychological sense of vulnerability in \nfunctional and dysfunctional fear (Killias, 1990; Jackson, 2009; cf. Stafford et al., 2007; Jackson \nand Stafford, 2009). A heightened personal susceptibility may emerge when people see the \npersonal consequences of victimisation to be high, see the personal control over victimisation to \nbe low, and see the likelihood of being targeted to be high. Applying this to functional fear, future \nstudies might assess whether feelings of vulnerability lead individuals to experience a more \ndysfunctional worry about crime that erodes quality of life in and of itself. It may additionally be \nthat the experience of crime itself heightens perceived vulnerability, explaining the stronger \nassociation between victimisation and dysfunctional worry about crime. \n \nConclusions \nPrevious research on the fear of crime has focused almost exclusively on the negative, on the \ndamaging face of public anxieties, on the corrosive impact of public perceptions of risk on health \nand well-being. As Sacco (1993) pointed out some fifteen years ago, hardly any attention has \nbeen given to the functional and motivational aspects of emotion. Hardly any attention has been \ngiven to the valuable properties of fear and its potential to motivate, problem solve, and alert the \nindividual to potential threat.  \nOver the past fifteen years a number of scholars have commented on the potentially \nbeneficial nature of fear of crime (Fattah, 1993; Hale, 1996; Warr, 2000; Ditton and Innes, 2005). \nYet this paper has provided the first empirical differentiation of fear into something that it is \ndysfunctional (an experience that in and of itself damages quality of life) and something that is \nfunctional (an experience that motivates precaution). We have explored some of the nuanced and \nlayered responses individuals can have to the risk of crime; we have suggested that worry is often \na habitual or routine activity (accepted as a common aspect of everyday life); and we have \nproposed that worrying about crime may, in the view of some people at least, be a functional \nreaction. Our data have highlighted the role of the active agent and the conscientious and \neffectual individual. This does not rule out the importance of professional interventions. But it \ndoes suggest that individuals (and communities) have the potential, willingness and ability to \nconvert worry about crime into constructive action. \nWhile we have presented evidence that worry about crime does not always erode quality \nof life, we are certainly not denying that people worry about crime and levels of disorder in the \nlocal area. Nor are we denying that crime fears can be deeply unpleasant. Some people did report \nthat their quality of life was diminished both by their worries about crime and the precautions \nthey take. Indeed three-quarters of the \u2018fearful\u2019 fell into the dysfunctional category. Yet we also \nfound that other people considered their worry about crime to be closer in form and texture to \nvigilance, precaution and \u2018common sense\u2019. Because they took precautions, because these \nprecautions made them feel safer, and because these individuals judged neither their worry nor \ntheir precaution to erode their quality of life, fear of crime emerged as a set of routine and \npractical actions embedded in the fabric of their lives. Norris and Kaniasty (1992) explored the \neffects of crime prevention on psychological distress. Consistent with their findings we suggest \nthat various psychological or practical strategies operate as a coping mechanism towards \nperceived risk of crime. Precaution or vigilance does not rid one of fear as such. But it does seem \nto provide protection and reassurance and buffer the individual from the effects of crime fears, \nallowing us to continue on with our everyday life.  \nFor too long, fear of crime research has ignored the \u2018everyday consumer\u2019 who engages in \nprecautionary behaviours, who buys security items, who successfully manages their own sense of \nrisk and their own emotional responses to risk. Given the political currency of the fear of crime, \nthis is more than just academic. In treating individuals who take precautions and successfully \nmanage perceived risk as experiencing a damaging form of worry about crime, research has \nrisked exaggerating the extent of fear of crime as a social problem. By focusing always on the \nnegative and the damaging \u2013 by focusing on the emotional responses which tip beyond a \n 15 \nmotivation to take everyday precautions into those moments that drain individual and group well-\nbeing \u2013 research has assumed that any expression of worry contributes to the status of fear as a \nsignificant social problem. Treating fear as a monolithic social ill distorts the nature of this \nparticular social phenomenon, but it might also lead to policy interventions that, while seeking to \nreduce fear of crime wherever it is to be found, only serve to dampen down healthy precaution.  \n  \nFinal words \nWe finish this paper with two issues that seem to us to complicate our treatment of functional fear \nof crime. There is the issue of \u2018getting the target right.\u2019 And there is the issue of \u2018hidden costs to \nfear.\u2019 For reasons of space, we only raise these as topics for future discussion and debate.  \nOn \u2018getting the target right,\u2019 the emotion here is worry, the target of the emotion is the \nrisk of criminal victimisation. If we are interested in the fit between the emotion and the target of \nthe emotion, then we need to interrogate what constitutes a \u2018poor fit.\u2019 Just because crime is bad \ndoes not mean that any response to the risk of crime is bad. Rather, the question is whether the \nlevel of feeling and action is appropriate. Does the level of emotion and action reflect an adequate \n\u2018tuning to the world\u2019 (Solomon, 2006: 186)? Most obviously this involves accurate assessments \nof the extent of the crime problem and the probability of personal victimisation. Yet even here \n\u2018getting the target right\u2019 may be complicated by the value we place on the perceived consequence \nof victimisation. If risk = probability x consequence then much can rest on the value you place on \nthe outcome (Douglas, 1985; Sparks, 1992; Nussbaum, 2004).  \nSecond, there may be important \u2018hidden costs\u2019 to worry and precautionary activity which \nthe methodology developed in this paper could not capture. People may think that their quality of \nlife is not reduced by their worries and precautions, but they may not be aware of the opportunity \ncosts of the precautions they take, as well as the community costs in the combined precautions \nthat individuals in a group make. Hidden opportunity costs might include where an individual \ncould have spent money and time on other things. Hidden community costs (such as the summed \neffects of people investing in gated communities) might lead to unfortunate social divisions and \never increasing sensitivity to safety and insecurity.  \nThese are difficult issues, to be sure. But if we are to take the idea seriously that fear of \ncrime can be a natural defence against crime \u2013 that some level of emotion in some circumstances \ncan be prudent and motivational, that some level of emotion can help people be resilient in the \nface of actual threat and danger \u2013 then \u2018getting the target right\u2019 and \u2018hidden costs\u2019 may be \nimportant topics of future enquiry (cf. Zedner, 2003; Loader and Walker, 2007). \n \n \n \n \n 16 \nFunding \n \nThe London Metropolitan Police Service funded the Safer Neighbourhoods Survey that we draw upon in \nthis study. \n 17 \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe are grateful for discussions we had with Stephen Farrall on the measurement of the fear of crime.
