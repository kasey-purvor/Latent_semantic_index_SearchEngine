At the Ubicomp Education\nWorkshop (see the related sidebar), a\nsmall number of researchers and edu-\ncators gathered to discuss how ubiqui-\ntous computing is taught at universities\nand whether we can define common\nthemes and resources to influence the\ndevelopment of future educational ma-\nterials. We aimed to uncover common\nthemes, gather advice for best practices,\nand seek ways to produce resources to\nshare with the larger ubiquitous com-\nputing community.\nThe one-day workshop was conducted\nin a fairly informal fashion, beginning\nwith each individual describing his or her\nexperience in teaching ubiquitous com-\nputing courses. The remainder of the\nworkshop involved collective brain-\nstorming on common themes and prac-\ntices of ubiquitous computing education.\nWe noted a considerable variety in the\nkinds of courses being offered, including\none-week block courses, reading semi-\nnars, traditional lecture courses, and\nopen-ended project courses. Despite this\nvariety, some common themes emerged\nduring the discussions, which we\u2019ll briefly\nsummarize here.\nHOW TO TEACH AND WHEN?\nThe topics of interest in ubiquitous\ncomputing go beyond or extend many\nof the core topics in computer science,\nincluding distributed systems, net-\nworking, databases, architecture, pro-\ngramming languages, human-computer\ninteraction, software engineering, and\nartificial intelligence. Ubiquitous com-\nputing also raises many interesting chal-\nlenges that lie outside of traditional\ncomputer science, such as socioeco-\nnomic impact, privacy, and legal issues.\nWe must ask whether to teach ubiqui-\ntous computing as a collection of spe-\ncialized modules that you can teach\nwithin the context of existing core\nclasses or as one or more additional\ncourses specifically designed to explore\nthe subject\u2019s breadth and depth. Most\nuniversities teach ubiquitous comput-\ning as self-contained courses, either as\nsenior-level undergraduate specializa-\ntion courses or as introductory gradu-\nate courses.\nAlthough computing or computer sci-\nence departments typically offer these\ncourses, the background of students in-\nterested in ubiquitous computing varies\nsubstantially, particularly at the gradu-\nate level, where specialized master\u2019s\ncourses can attract students with diverse\ntechnical and design backgrounds.While\nthis enhances the educational experience,\nparticularly with group project activity,\nit also increases the challenge of devel-\noping educational materials that will\nreach the entire audience.\nWorkshop attendees described how\nthey\u2019ve taught ubiquitous computing in\nthe past: \n\u2022 Brief, intense one-week courses for\ngraduate students or industry, cover-\ning general lecture or tutorial mate-\nrial as well as hands-on design and\nimplementation projects\n\u2022T raditional lecture courses of 10 to\n16 weeks, usually accompanied by\ngroup projects\n\u2022O pen-ended project courses, in\nwhich an instructor facilitates small\ngroups throughout a lifecycle of con-\ncept development to prototype de-\nployment with ubiquitous comput-\ning technologies\n\u2022T echnology-centric development\nReport from the Ubicomp\nEducation Workshop\nGregory D.

Rather than\npresenting information about a specific class, the authors discuss, more broadly, the status\nand future directions for pervasive and ubiquitous computing education. The column summa-\nrizes the Ubicomp Education Workshop, which the authors chaired, held in conjunction with\nUbiComp 2003. We hope the column will serve as a foundation for future discussions on per-\nvasive and ubiquitous computing education, such as at the Workshop on Pervasive Comput-\ning Education held in conjunction with PerCom 2004 (www.percom.org).

Although\nmany courses assign Mark Weiser\u2019s\nseminal  Scientific American article\n(reprinted in the January\u2013March 2002\nissue of IEEE Pervasive Computing) as\nthe first reading, the path after that is\nless clear. A major outcome of this\nworkshop is a proposed set of five\nthemes for an introductory course in\nubiquitous computing. \nTheme 1: Physical and \nvirtual integration\nMuch of ubiquitous computing\u2019s\nintrigue deals with merging the physical\nand virtual worlds. Important sub-\ntopics include\n\u2022 Sensing and actuation. Students\nshould be introduced to ways to\ngather information about the physi-\ncal world and represent it in the vir-\ntual world, as well as how to take\ndecisions made in the virtual world\nand make them apparent in the phys-\nical world.\n\u2022 Awareness and perception. Students\nshould learn how to extend the notion\nof sensing and how to create higher-\nlevel knowledge of the physical world.\n\u2022 Ambient displays. Students should\nsee how to use the physical world\u2019s\nfeatures to reflect information from\nthe virtual world.\n\u2022 World modeling. Students should\nlearn to create representations and\nontologies of the physical world that\nthey can represent virtually.\nTheme 2: Interaction models\nThe human experience with ubiqui-\ntous computing is important for stu-\ndents to understand and design. This\ntopic deals with formative ways to pro-\nduce the right human experience. Im-\nportant subtopics include\n\u2022 Situated computing. Ubiquitous com-\nputing is woven into everyday activi-\nties, so it\u2019s important for students to\nunderstand the relationship between\ntechnologies and everyday life.\n\u2022 Multimodality and natural interaction.\nUbiquitous computing encourages\nnumerous modes of interaction, so stu-\ndents should understand both explicit\ninteraction, such as speech, gestures,\nand writing, and implicit interaction,\nsuch as location and user activity.\n\u2022 Multidevice. We can view the age of\nubiquitous computing as one in which\nusers interact with many devices, both\nshared and personal. Students should\nbe exposed to the many form factors\nof devices that provide the ways to\ninteract.\n\u2022 Invisibility. The essence of Mark\nWeiser\u2019s vision was that the prolifera-\ntion of computing results in a decrease\nin the cognitive demand on the indi-\nvidual. Students must understand that\nthe invisibility doesn\u2019t mean the tech-\nnology shrinks but that its pull on our\nconsciousness decreases.\n\u2022 Disambiguation. Sensing and perception\naren\u2019t perfect, so students should learn\ntechniques to represent and reconcile im-\nperfect knowledge for consumption by\nboth humans and software.\n\u2022 Proactivity. The profusion of com-\nputational devices envisioned by\nubiquitous computing raises the\nquestion of effective user control.\nStudents should be familiar with\nboth traditional models of user-\ninitiated interaction\u2014that is, direct\nmanipulation\u2014as well as proactive\nor mixed-initiative interfaces.\n\u2022 Models of cognition. Models of indi-\nvidual cognition drive much of tra-\nditional human-computer interaction\npractice. To design for ubiquitous\ncomputing, students must under-\nstand extensions to traditional mod-\nels that consider behaviors influenced\nby the physical world.\nTheme 3: System components\nEmerging technology provides the\nbuilding blocks for creating ubiqui-\ntous computing systems. These com-\nponents represent a system\u2019s hardware\nand software aspects. Important sub-\ntopics include\n\u2022 Platforms. Students must learn about\ndevices or platforms with small form\nfactors that are highly mobile and\nattached to an individual, as well as\nthose that you can easily embed into\nthe environment.\n\u2022 Sensors and actuators. Students\nshould understand the importance of\ninterpreting the physical world (sens-\nJANUARY\u2013MARCH 2004 PERVASIVEcomputing 95\nThe workshop on \u201cUbicomp Education: Current Status and Future Directions\u201d was \nheld on 12 October 2003 in conjunction with the International Conference on Ubiq-\nuitous Computing (UbiComp 2003) in Seattle (http:\/\/ubicomp.lancs.ac.uk\/workshops\/\neducation03).

The\nactual devices that perform both\nsensing and actuation are this sub-\ntopic\u2019s focus.\n\u2022 Power awareness. The proliferation\nof wireless and highly mobile com-\nputational platforms brings an in-\ncreased concern for delivery of power\nto these devices. In addition to ad-\nvances in battery technology, students\nshould also learn about the design of\npower-aware computation.\n\u2022 Communications technologies and\nconnectivity. Highly distributed com-\nputational platforms are more useful\nwhen they can communicate. Courses\nin ubiquitous computing should cover\nadvances in both wired and wireless\ncommunications technologies.\n\u2022 Software architectures and technolo-\ngies. The wide variety of computing\nplatforms is matched by the many\nsoftware technologies used to create\nubiquitous computing applications.\nAs is often the case for complex system\ndevelopment, the complexity lies not in\nthe individual components but in their\nintegration into a functioning system.\nUbiquitous computing courses must\naddress many software challenges,\nincluding architectural approaches,\nnaming schemes, resource discovery,\nand event notification. Many of these\nare software engineering challenges for\nubiquitous computing.\nTheme 4: Deployment\nPutting applications into the real\nworld raises many challenges associated\nwith the summative understanding of\nubiquitous computing. Important sub-\ntopics include\n\u2022 Scalability. Students should under-\nstand that ubiquitous computing is\ncharacterized by applications that\naddress scale in terms of space, peo-\nple, and devices.\n\u2022 Reliability. Students should learn to\naddress reliability issues, because ap-\nplications in the real world must work,\neven when constituent parts fail.\n\u2022 Maintenance. Students should learn\nprinciples of maintenance because in\nareas where technologies advance\nrapidly, it\u2019s particularly important to\nevolve applications as underlying\ntechnologies change.\n\u2022 Evaluation. Traditional forms of eval-\nuation from the field of human-com-\nputer interaction often fail when\napplied to ubiquitous computing sys-\ntems. Students should learn techniques\napplied \u201cin the wild\u201d and not just con-\ntrolled laboratory user studies.\n\u2022 Practicality. Students need to under-\nstand various practical concerns for\ndaily system operation, including cost\nand convenience.\nTheme 5: Social concerns\nUbiquitous computing promises to\nimpact even more of our everyday\nlives than personal computing, and\nthis brings consequent concerns about\nhow the technology and services best\nserve social needs. Technology itself is\nonly one factor that influences or con-\ntrols the relationship between people\nand ubiquitous computing. Important\nsubtopics include\n\u2022 Socioeconomics. Students should ap-\npreciate that market forces can influ-\nence system deployment and sustain-\nability. Students should appreciate that\nthe way in which a technology is per-\nceived to impact social interactions can\ngreatly influence adoption and long-\nterm use.\n\u2022 Legal issues. Concerns that suitable\nsocial, market, and technological\nforces cannot address are often left\nEDUCATION & TRAINING\nEDUCATION & TRAINING\n96 PERVASIVEcomputing www.computer.org\/pervasive\nActive Badge (Cambridge Univ.)\u2014www.uk.research.att.com\/ab.html \nActive Campus (UC San Diego)\u2014http:\/\/activecampus.ucsd.edu\nActivityCompass (Univ. of Washington)\u2014www.cs.washington.edu\/homes\/djp3\/AI\/AssistedCognition\/ActivityCompass\nAware Home (Georgia Tech)\u2014www.cc.gatech.edu\/fce\/ahri\nCooltown (HP)\u2014http:\/\/cooltown.hp.com\/cooltownhome\nDigital desk (Univ. of Toronto)\neClass\/Classroom2000 (Georgia Tech)\u2014www.cc.gatech.edu\/fce\/eclass\nEquator projects, including Uncle Roy All Around You, Can You See Me Now?, and Ambient Wood Guide (various universities)\u2014\nwww.equator.ac.uk\niRoom (Stanford Univ.)\u2014http:\/\/iwork.stanford.edu\nLabscape (Intel\/Univ. of Washington)\u2014http:\/\/labscape.cs.washington.edu\nMediaCup (TecO\/Univ. of Karlsruhe)\u2014http:\/\/mediacup.teco.edu \nMusicFX (Accenture)\u2014www.accenture.com\nNeuralNetwork Home (Univ. of Colorado) \nPARCTab (Xerox Parc)\u2014www.ubiq.com\/parctab\nPlantCare (Intel)\u2014http:\/\/seattleweb.intel-research.net\/projects\/plantcare\nRemembrance Agent (MIT Media Lab)\u2014www.remem.org\nSmart-Its (Lancaster Univ.)\u2014www.comp.lancs.ac.uk\/eis\nSmart Kindergarten (UCLA)\u2014http:\/\/mediacup.teco.edu\nCASE STUDIES DISCUSSED AT THE WORKSHOPto legal bodies. It\u2019s important for stu-\ndents to understand how national\nand international laws influence and\nare influenced by technology.\n\u2022 Privacy\u2014Integrating the physical\nand virtual worlds has huge implica-\ntions on personal privacy, security,\nand autonomy. Students must under-\nstand how to respect the individual\nand see how ubiquitous computing\ninfluences an individual\u2019s power.\nAlthough the workshop identified the\ncore areas just discussed, the participants\ndidn\u2019t determine any particular ordering\nof the topics, nor did they identify spe-\ncific important results and readings in\nthe different areas. Future examinations\nof ubiquitous computing education\nshould identify seminal readings.\nLEARNING \nTHROUGH EXPERIENCE\nMost workshop participants agreed\nthat the best understanding of ubiqui-\ntous computing comes through experi-\nence. In the educational setting, this\nmeans exploring specific examples\nfrom the past, so-called case studies, or\nthe hands-on development of ubiqui-\ntous computing applications done\nthrough individual or group projects.\nDesign projects\nMost courses in ubiquitous comput-\ning involve hands-on experience with\nsome of the technologies and applica-\ntions. Teaching students how to struc-\nture projects to ensure successful learn-\ning outcomes has been a concern. With\ncritical technologies\u2014such as wireless\nconnectivity, handheld computing, sen-\nsors and actuators, and recognition tech-\nnologies\u2014becoming more mainstream,\nit\u2019s easier to provide a relevant infra-\nstructure for students to build projects.\nThe extent to which classes ask stu-\ndents to design as well as implement\nvaries. Some courses consider the user-\ncentered design and prototyping as a crit-\nical project component, even more\nimportant than building a real system.\nThis kind of project encourages creative\napplication of technologies, even when\nthose technologies aren\u2019t available. Other\ncourses emphasize construction with\nubiquitous computing technologies, to\nthe extent of ignoring user-centered\ndesign. Although these projects often\nmight not provide compelling uses of\ntechnology, they teach students the\nimportance of integration. The workshop\ndidn\u2019t judge which is right or wrong. Both\napproaches have strengths and limita-\ntions, and the kind of project chosen will\nvary based on the students\u2019 backgrounds.\nWe also recognize that the available\nbuilding block technologies often influ-\nence the applications that students can\nexplore. Many courses leverage easily\navailable commodity platforms, such as\nhandheld computers.

Increasingly, we\u2019re seeing\nresearch labs produce hardware tech-\nnologies that other researchers can use\nfor exploration. Examples include Phid-\ngets from the University of Calgary;\nMotes from the University of California,\nBerkeley, and Crossbow; and European\nSmart-Its.\nCase studies\nFor case studies, a ubiquitous comput-\ning course could use the research com-\nmunity\u2019s growing list of interesting inves-\ntigations of ubiquitous computing\napplications. The extent of documenta-\ntion marks an important feature of a good\ncase study. This includes retrospective\narticles on the project\u2019s history and les-\nsons learned as well as artifacts that stu-\ndents can explore. It\u2019s also important to\ndiscuss case studies in terms of the core\nintellectual topics outlined earlier. Al-\nthough it\u2019s unlikely that any single case\nstudy will exhibit important features from\nevery intellectual topic, you might choose\na case study on the basis of its coverage\nof those topics (see the related sidebar for\ncase studies discussed at the workshop).\nBuilding shared resources\nAlthough it might be premature to\nsuggest writing a textbook for this\nfield, it\u2019s appropriate as a community\nfor us to develop a means to share edu-\ncational materials. Those who teach\nubiquitous computing courses produce\nonline repositories of readings, lec-\ntures, projects, and case studies. One\nrecommendation from the workshop\nis to develop a single online repository\nor clearinghouse for gathering ubiqui-\ntous computing educational material.\nThe most likely location for such a\nclearinghouse is ubicomp.org, the com-\nmunity\u2019s formal site for conferences\nand discussion forums.\nT\nhe Ubicomp Education Workshop\nwas intentionally informal because\nit was one of the first meetings to dis-\ncuss education in ubiquitous comput-\ning. Several national and international\nforums for ubiquitous and pervasive\ncomputing now exist, such as the Work-\nshop on Pervasive Computing Educa-\ntion (www.irean.vt.edu\/PerEd2004) in\nMarch 2004. We strongly recommend\nthat future forums take on the specific\nchallenges we\u2019ve raised to continue to\nadvance the educational agenda for this\nimportant emerging topic. \nEDUCATION & TRAINING\nEDUCATION & TRAINING\n98 PERVASIVEcomputing www.computer.org\/pervasive\nGregory D.
