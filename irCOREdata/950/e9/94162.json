This is considered as a result of a \nproblem of sharing the cost of the provision of central computing facilities between \ndifferent faculties in a large university, but the basic problem is widespread. A Linear  \nProgramming model is considered in order to minimise cost. The dual of this model is \nshown to correspond to an efficient allocation of costs. An alternative optimal dual \nsolution is shown to give a \u2018fair\u2019 solution according to criteria resulting from \ncooperative game theory. \n \nKeywords:   Cost Allocation, Efficiency, Fairness, Linear Programming, Duality, \nGame Theory \n \n 3\n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \n \nWhen different consumers share the use of common facilities the problem of how \nmuch to charge each consumer for its share of the cost of each facility arises. While it \nis reasonable that each consumer be charged the marginal cost of its usage it is not \nclear how much of the fixed cost it should be charged. There is no unambiguous \nanswer. Notions of \u2018fairness\u2019 and \u2018equity\u2019 (themselves ambiguous, see, for example \nRawls 1) may suggest one division. Economic efficiency may suggest another. These \naims are not, however, diametrically opposed as will be seen in subsequent sections. \nThey are, however, clearly not the same. \n \nThe problem we are considering arose in the allocation of central computing facilities \nand services in a large university. Technological change over the last decade has \nresulted in decentralisation of computing power to personal computers, although there \nis still some need among specialist users for very powerful mainframes. However \nthere are still arguments in favour of some centralisation of services and the provision \nof services. These considerations gave rise to some faculties in the university \nconsidering \u2018going it alone\u2019 with their own provision (possibly from private \ncompanies) or forming consortia with other faculties with similar needs and tendering \nfor the provision of external services. The final solution was however, both on \ngrounds of cost and control, to continue with one centrally provided service. This was \nargued to be the most efficient solution. However it was considered unacceptable for \nindividual faculties, or groups of faculties, to pay more than they would by going it \nalone. This was the fairness criterion. The full problem is described in section 4. \nSome aspects and monetary figures have been changed to preserve confidentiality. \nThe problem is, however, part of a more general problem which we will discuss. \n \nThe general problem of finding an efficient allocation of facilities to different \n\u2018customers\u2019 so as to maximise revenue or overall utility or to minimise cost can be \nformulated as a Linear (LP) or Integer (IP) Programming model. The dual of such a \nmodel gives an allocation of costs to the customers which can be regarded as the most \n\u2018efficient\u2019 (see, for example Williams 2, 3 and Biddle and Steinberg 4). \n \nFor a \u2018fair\u2019 allocation we can use a model from Cooperative Game Theory. This \nmodel can itself be solved by Linear Programming. It is similar to the dual model \nmentioned above but has a different objective function. \n \nExamples where problems of a similar nature arise, and have been studied, are: \n \nAllocating the costs of railway stations to the lines that use them. (Rhys 5, also \ndiscussed in Williams 6). \n \nAllocating the fixed (set-up) costs of electricity generation to different classes of \nconsumer (discussed in Williams 6). \n \nAllocating the costs of airport runways to the different airlines that use them. \n(Littlechild and Thompson  7 ). \n 4\n \nAllocating the cost of building a dam, to create a reservoir, among the different uses \nto which it might be put (hydro-electric generation, recreation, flood control etc.). \nThis is discussed in relation to the Tennessee Valley Authority by Ransmeier 8. \n \nDividing Credit Card costs fairly (Thomas 9). \n \nThe whole problem can be seen as a microcosm of a central problem of political \norganisation; reconciling fairness and equity of wealth with economic efficiency. \n \n \n \n2. THE BASIC PROBLEM \n \nWe have a set of Facilities F = {1,2,..,m} serving a set of  \u2018customers\u2019   \nC = {1,2,..,n}. \n \nCustomer j requires one of the facilities in F  F for each k kj \u2282 \u03b5  K , ie customer j \nrequires at least one of F , and at least one of F  etc. \nj\n1\nj\n2\nj\n \nThe fixed cost of i \u03b5  F is f i . \n \nCustomer j produces a benefit (revenue) b . j\n \nIt may not be desirable to cater for all the customers or provide all the facilities. \n \nF could be a set of railway stations, electric generators, airport runways of different \nlengths, dams of possible heights, factories, swimming pools or cash card dispensers. \nCorresponding to each of these C would be a set of railway lines, electricity \nconsumers, aircraft types, reservoir users, domestic consumers, swimming pool users \nor brands of credit card. \n \nIf a facility i is provided its cost f i  must be split up among the customers j that use it \nin an acceptable or desirable way. \n \n \n 5\n3. AN OPTIMISATION MODEL \n \nPrimal Model \n \nWe formulate a 0-1 Integer Programming model. \n \nVariables \n \n               i\u03b4  = 1 if facility i  is provided \n                    = 0  otherwise \n \n \n               j\u03b3   = 1 if customer j is catered for \n                      =  0 otherwise \n \nObjective \n \n         Maximise      \u2211 b  \nj\nj j\u03b3  -    \u2211i f i \u03b4 i                                          (1) \n \nConstraints \n \n                                all j 0       \u2264\u2212 \u2211\nk\njFi\nij\n\u03b5\n\u03b4\u03b3 \u03b5  C, all k \u03b5  Kj      (2) \n \n                                   1                          all j \u2264\u03b3 j \u03b5  C                         (3) \n                              \n                                                        all i 0\u2265\u03b4 i \u03b5  F                         (4) \n \n \nWe refer to the above model as P. \n \nConstraints (2) force at least one of F  to be provided, for each j and k, if customer j \nis to be served. It is not necessary to impose non-negativity conditions on the \nk\nj\n\u03b3  \nvariables or append upper bounds of 1 on the \u03b4  variables. These conditions are \nguaranteed by the structure of the model. \n \nThere is no guarantee that this general model will produce integer solutions if solved \nas a Linear Programme. In certain special cases, however, integral solutions to the LP \nare guaranteed. For example if for all j and k | F | = 1 then this is the case. This is \ndiscussed in, for example, Williams \nk\nj\n6 and illustrated there by the example of Rhys 5. \nIn that case a railway line requires exactly two terminal stations. Integrality is also \nguaranteed (trivially) when there are no distinct benefits b, only costs, the costs are \nsubadditive ie sharing of facilities will not produce an increase in cost, but usually a \ndecrease, and there is a facility which can serve all customers. Such a condition often \n 6\napplies in practice and is the case in the example which we consider in section 4 of \nthis paper. \n \nWhen the LP solution is integer then there is a well defined dual LP model (see eg \nDantzig 10 ). If this is not the case then there are a number of possible duals, all \nlacking some of the properties of the LP dual. For convenience of exposition we \npostpone discussion of this issue. It is covered by, for example, Williams 2 . \n \nWe consider the dual of the LP relaxation of the above model. (For convenience we \nhave reversed the direction of some of the constraints in the formal dual model) \n \nDual Model (of LP Relaxation) \n \n      Minimise             \u2211                                                              (5) \nCj\nj\n\u03b5\nu\n \n      Subject to:          =   b       all j \u2211+\nj\nvu      \nKk\nj\n\u03b5\nk\nj j \u03b5  C                (6) \n \n                                       \u2211\nk\niFjj \u03b5 :\nv kj \u2264 f i          all i \u03b5  F                   (7) \n                                        jKk\u03b5\n \n                                             ,    0           all j ju\nk\njv \u2265 \u03b5  C, k \u03b5  K   (8) j\n \n \nWe refer to the above model as D. \n  can be interpreted as the portion of the fixed cost f i  of each of the facilities i (for \nk\nk\njv\n\u03b5 K ) that j requires. In the case that a customer is not catered for the  can be \nignored. \nj\nk\njv\n \n  can be interpreted as the excess benefit (revenue) which j obtains after \ncontributing all the required costs. The objective is to minimise the total excess. \nju\n \nConstraints (7) split the cost f i  between the customers using the facility. Should the \nfull cost not be met (the constraint is non-binding) the orthogonality result of LP \nguarantees that i\u03b4  = 0, ie that the facility not be built. Hence there is no question of \ncustomers contributing more, in total, than they would if they were sharing an \nalternative facility. This is one of the conditions of \u2018fairness\u2019 discussed in the next \nsection. \n \nConstraints (6) split the benefits to customers between the imputed costs and \nexcesses. \nGenerally there will be a number of alternate optimal dual solutions. Among these \nalternate solutions will be, a solution that could be regarded as, the fairest solution, in \na sense to be defined in section 5. That the \u2018fairest\u2019 solution is among those cost \n 7\nallocations that are consistent with the most efficient solution is of significance. This \nis proved in section 5 and illustrated by the example in section 6. \n \n \n4. THE ALLOCATION OF COMPUTING FACILITIES \n \nThis problem arose in a large university where decisions had to be made about the \nprovision of academic computing facilities. The university has nine faculties: \n \nVeterinary Science \nMedicine \nArchitecture \nEngineering  \nArts \nCommerce \nAgriculture \nScience \nSocial Science \n \nThe university wanted to retain one computer services department providing support, \nservicing individual personal computers and laboratories as well as networking and \nproviding specialist high powered computing and software. It also turned out that this \nwas the most cost effective solution for the university as a whole. Individual faculties, \nhowever, argued, with some justification, that they could sometimes obtain these \nservices more cheaply using other suppliers. Also certain faculties had similar needs  \nand could form consortia to get even better deals. \n \nThe yearly fixed costs for the individual faculties \u2018going it alone\u2019 (ie seeking outside \nprovision) were estimated to be (in \u00a3100 000). \n \nVeterinary Science         6 \nMedicine                        7 \nArchitecture                   2 \nEngineering                   10 \nArts                              18 \nCommerce                    30 \nAgriculture                    11 \nScience                         29 \nSocial Science                7 \n \nThe possible consortia with their yearly estimated fixed costs of obtaining \nindependent provision were: \n \n1.

The objective is to maximise \nthe total cost allocation. An  optimal solution to this dual model is to make the \nfollowing allocation of the cost of central provision: \njv\n \n 9\n \n \nFaculty                        Cost Allocation                  Saving from individual provision \n \nVeterinary Science 6 0 \nMedicine 3 4 \nArchitecture 2 0 \nEngineering 0 10 \nArts 11 7 \nCommerce 30 0 \nAgriculture 8 3 \nScience 29 0 \nSocial Science 7 0 \n \nConsortium                                                                       Savings \n \n(Veterinary Science, Medicine) 2 \n(Architecture, Engineering) 9 \n(Arts, Social Science) 7 \n(Agriculture, Science) 0 \n(Veterinary Science, Medicine, Agriculture, Science) 0 \n(Arts, Commerce, Social Science) 5 \n \n \nNot surprisingly (as a result of the duality theorem of LP ) the optimal solution \nexactly meets the cost (96) of the ( optimal ) central provision (the corresponding \nconstraint  (13) is binding ). It can be observed that no faculty or consortium is \ncharged more than would be the case with its alternative provision. It also follows \nfrom the duality theorem of LP that since the primal model is feasible and not \nunbounded there will be a feasible dual solution ie there will be an allocation of costs \nwhich is \u2018fair\u2019 in the above, restricted, sense. There are, however, many alternate dual \nsolutions some of which might be \u2018fairer\u2019. The existence of alternate dual solutions \nwould be expected from a model with this structure (the primal model exhibits \n\u2018degeneracy\u2019). \n \nWe now explore the issue of \u2018fairness\u2019 and demonstrate that among the alternate cost \nallocations we can find a fairer one. \n \nSuch a fairer one will, however, almost certainly not be a \u2018basic\u2019 one (in the \nterminology of LP). \n \n \n \n5. A FAIRNESS MODEL \n \nThe issue of fairness in cost allocation has been explored by Shubik 12, and in the \nbook edited by Peyton Young 13, using concepts from Cooperative Game Theory. \nFor an allocation to be \u2018fair\u2019 it must lie in the \u2018core\u2019. This amounts to satisfying the \nconstraints of the dual model above. Such an allocation would give players in a \n 10\ncooperative game an incentive to join a coalition as their overall payoff (negated cost) \nwould be improved. Within the core there will generally be at least one, and normally \nmany, solutions. A number of criteria exist for choosing a solution from the core. The \nmost popular is probably the Shapley Value (see Shubik 12 ). We, alternatively, use \nthe nucleolus. This is an attempt to find the solution which is most \u2018central\u2019 to the \ncore (see eg Young 13 ) in the sense that the savings to the \u2018customers\u2019 from not using \nalternative coalitions (aggregated over the coalitions) is as nearly as possible equal. \n \nTo make this concept precise we maximise the minimum saving over each coalition. \nWe also include all the possible fictional coalitions, whose costs can be regarded as \nthe minimal sum of the costs of any coalitions and the alternative individual provision \nof the members of the coalition. If there are alternatives then we minimise the number \nof coalitions with this saving, repeating the procedure with the coalition with next \nsmallest saving and so on (giving what is known as the lexicographic minimum).  \n \nSince a fair solution is not something about which there is ever likely to be consensus \n we anticipate objections which might be raised to the solution given below. A variety   \n of fairness criteria are discussed in the seminal paper of Yaari and Bar-Hillel 13   . \nThey conducted a series of experiments to see which of  nine possible criteria were \n considered most fair by a sample of people questioned. In relation to needs (as \n opposed to the more subjective qualities of tastes and beliefs) an allocation based on \n minimising the maximum inequality was overwhelmingly considered the most fair. \n This accords with the criterion we are using here. \n \nFormally, relating this to the dual model in section 3, we introduce slack variables s   \ninto the constraints (7) and create a new objective to give the model \n \n \n             Maximise(Minimum  s i )                                                       (16) \n                      i \n \n             Subject to:  =   b       all j \u2211+\njKk\nj     \n\u03b5\nvu kj j \u03b5  C                    (17) \n \n                         +    s i        =   f i        all i \u2211\nk\njFj : i\nk\nj\n  \nv\n\u03b5\n\u03b5  F                    (18) \n                    jKk\u03b5\n                                             ,    \u2265   0         all j ju kjv \u03b5  C, k \u03b5  K                 (19) j\n \n \nIn the dual model, in section 3, it was not necessary to create constraints for the \nfictional coalitions since they must be satisfied automatically and therefore be \nredundant. \n \nThe objective can be dealt with by introducing a variable z and constraints  \n \n \n                                       z      \u2264   s i                   all i \u03b5  F              (20) \n 11\nThe objective then becomes  \n \n                                           Maximise         z \n \n \nWe refer to the above model as F.  \n \nA variant, which could be considered fairer, is to seek the per capita nucleolis. To do \nthis we inversely weight the slack variables by the size of each coalition to which they \ncorrespond. \n \nIt is interesting to note that whereas the dual model to D is obviously P (reflexivity of \nthe duality relation), even when P gives an integral solution, the dual model to F will, \nin general, not give an integral solution and has no obvious interpretation. This means \nthat obtaining a \u2018fair\u2019 allocation of costs has to be modelled directly and does not \nemerge from the dual values of any obvious facility location model. \n \nWhen we have found an optimal solution to F we will need to fix the objective at the \noptimal value and further optimise on sections of the model to find the lexicographic \nminimum. \n \nTheorem \n \nAn optimal solution to F will also be an optimal solution to D. \n \nProof: \n \nSuppose we have an optimal solution v * to F which is not an optimal solution v  to \nD \nj\n+\nj\nie       <                                                                                 (21) \u2211\nj\nj\n*v \u2211 +\nj\njv\n \nConsider each of those constraints (18) in which the maximum s i  is attained. Each of \nthese constraints must contain at least one variable v *  which occurs only in \nconstraints involving a subset of constraints (7) which are not binding. Otherwise \nmaximising (12) over all the constraints (18) containing this variable would contradict \nthe subadditivity condition on the f i . \nj\n \nIt is therefore possible to increase the value of each of these variables reducing the \nvalues of the maximal s i  and contradicting our hypothesis. \n \nThis result shows that the seeking of a fair solution is not at variance with the seeking \nof an optimal solution. Rather, among the different cost allocations which are \nconsistent with the optimal solution, we must seek that one which minimises the \nsavings in the manner described above. We illustrate this by means of our example. \n \n 12\n6.

CONCLUSIONS AND EXTENSIONS \n \nWe demonstrate that, in certain problems, considerations of efficiency (optimality) \nand fairness in the allocation of the costs of shared facilities are not necessarily \nopposed. However a \u2018fair\u2019 allocation may be only one of a number of efficient \nallocations. We are not asserting that the solutions produced are \u2018fair\u2019 in any absolute \nsense but hoping that they help to clarify the concept. \n \nThis result arises when the Linear Programming formulation of the facility allocation \nproblem has an integer solution, and therefore a well-defined dual. When this is not \nthe case there are a number of alternative ways of defining a dual with more limited \nproperties. The value of these duals in providing a satisfactory allocation of costs will \nform the subject of another paper. \n \n \n \n8. REFERENCES \n \n \n1.   J.Rawls (1971), A Theory of Justice.
