Love lyricists use antitheses to depict the \nlover\u201fs experience: opposites such as heat and cold, sickness and health, and \nfire and ice are extremely commonplace. Two very different conceptions of \n\u201eopposites\u201f were available to philosophical prose: those of the Aristotelian \nsquare of \u201eopposites\u201f, and those which, in the thought of Nicholas of Cusa, \ncoincide in the vision of the divine. In this essay, I will examine examples of \nboth love poetry and prose philosophy: Maurice Sc\u00e8ve\u201fs D\u00e9lie (1544) and \nCharles de Bovelles\u201fs Ars Oppositorum (1511)1 respectively. I intend to \nshow that both texts, in their contrasting discursive domains, explore \nopposition and its relationship to difference, identity, and similarity; both \n                                                 \n1\n The Ars was published together with a series of other works; it reworks and develops material from \nBovelles\u201fs earlier In Artem Oppositorum Introductio (1501). \n 2 \nalso challenge conceptions of difference and identity, expressing a particular \ninterest in antithetical or binary pairs.  \nStephen Murphy\u201fs fascinating article, \u201eBovelles. Sc\u00e8ve. Bruno. \nAntiperistasis\u201f, pointed to convergences between Bovelles and Petrarchist \npoetry in general as well as Sc\u00e8ve\u201fs D\u00e9lie in particular.2 Murphy notes that \nin both Bovelles\u201fs theory and Petrarchist poetry opposites serve to intensify \neach other; in the case of poetry, the lover\u201fs mal means that his bien \nincreases. Murphy further suggests that the D\u00e9lie is particularly interesting \nbecause of its oft-noted evocation of simultaneous opposites (rather than \ncyclical ones), such as \u201eheureux souffrir\u201f (pp. 43-6). Murphy then pursues \nother related concerns, analysing conceptions of opposition in Bruno\u201fs \ncommentary on love poems in De gli eroici furori, and their movement \ntowards mystical theology; however, opposites in the D\u00e9lie \u2013 and their \nrelationship to Bovelles\u201fs writing \u2013 are also very worthy of further study. \nSc\u00e8ve and Bovelles share an interest not only in the mutual intensification of \nopposites but also in the relationship between antithetical modes of \ndifference and other kinds, as well as in the dynamic interactions between \ndifferent pairs of opposites.  \n                                                 \n2 Allegorica 14 (1993), pp. 39-52.

The Aristotelian notion of a square of \nopposites is central to the Ars but Bovelles uses it very differently from more \ntraditional Aristotelian writers.\n3\n Bovelles\u201fs square, like the Aristotelian one, \nis intended to produce knowledge. However, it differs from the traditional \nsquare concerning the types of \u201eopposition\u201f involved in creating knowledge, \nas well as the sort of knowledge achieved.  \nThe Aristotelian square of opposites was used to analyse the \nrelationships of \u201eopposition\u201f between propositions (statements), in order to \ndetermine how the possible truth or falsity of one or more propositions \nlimited the possible truth or falsity of others. \u201eOpposition\u201f did not carry its \n                                                 \n3\n For discussions of Bovelles\u201fs Ars, see Maurice de Gandillac, \u201eL\u201fArt bovilien des oppos\u00e9s\u201f, in Charles de \nBovelles en son cinqui\u00e8me centenaire 1479-1979: Actes du colloque international tenu \u00e0 Noyon les 14-15-\n16 septembre 1979, ed. by Jean-Claude Margolin (Paris: Guy Tr\u00e9daniel, \u00c9ditions de la Maisnie, 1982), pp. \n157-70; Joseph M. Victor, Charles de Bovelles 1479-1553: An Intellectual Biography (Geneva: Droz, \n1978), pp. 73-87; and Jean-Claude Margolin, \u201eSur L\u2019Art des oppos\u00e9s de Bovelles\u201f, in Logique et Litt\u00e9rature \n\u00e0 la Renaissance: Actes du Colloque de la Baume-les-Aix, Universit\u00e9 de Provence, 16-18 septembre 1991, \neds Marie-Luce Demonay-Launay and Andr\u00e9 Tournon (Paris: Champion, 1994), pp. 5-16. \n 4 \nmodern everyday meaning of antithetical or absolute difference but rather \nreferred to four contrasting kinds of differing, of which only the \u201econtrary\u201f \nimplies absolute difference (of the type existing between the propositions \n\u201eall A is B\u201f and \u201eno A is B\u201f). Depending upon which of the particular \n\u201eoppositions\u201f (or types of differing) held between propositions, particular \ninferences could be made: thus the square provided a logical basis for \nvalidating certain forms of argument regardless of whether the subject-\nmatter concerned, for example, the mortality of men or the ingratitude of \nrepublics. \nBy contrast with traditional Aristotelian logicians, Bovelles inserts \ninto his square of opposites not propositions (such as \u201call men are mortal\u201d) \nbut single terms such as \u201clight\u201d, \u201cdarkness\u201d, \u201cGod\u201d, \u201cnothing\u201d, \u201ctruth\u201d, \n\u201cfalsity\u201d, \u201cunity\u201d and \u201cnumber\u201d. Furthermore, Bovelles states in the opening \nparagraph of his first chapter that for him oppositio (opposition) refers not \nsimply to the logicians\u201f four types of difference but rather to any sort of \nrelationship between things: \u201ewe, by contrast [with the \u201edialecticians\u201f], wish \nin this work to give a broader meaning to the term of opposition \u2026 for \nalthough most things in existence seem not to have received from nature any \ncontrariety or dispute, they are nevertheless called opposites with respect to \n 5 \none another for the sole reason of their mutual relation\u201f.4 Bovelles expresses \nthis mutual relation in spatial terms which are characteristic of much of his \ndiscussion throughout the Ars.\n5\n However, while being broader than logical \ncategories of difference, it is clearly a relation of some kind of difference (or \nidentity): Bovelles proceeds to discuss the sources of \u201eevery difference and \nunity of things\u201f.6 As in Aristotelian logic, consideration of oppositions can \nreveal knowledge about many disciplines, but for Bovelles (as he explains in \nhis dedicatory address to Fran\u00e7ois de Melun) this is because knowledge \nabout one discipline can be gleaned from another, thanks to the \n                                                 \n4\n \u201eNos vero hoc in proposito latius oppositionis nomen extendi volumus \u2026 Nam tametsi pleraque entium \nnullam natura aut contrarietatem aut pugnantiam sortita esse videantur, opposita tamen invicem sola mutue \nrelationis causa vocantur\u201f: ed. by Pierre Magnard, (Paris: Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1984), p. 36. I \nrefer throughout to Magnard\u201fs edition; translations into English are my own, although I have consulted \nMagnard\u201fs French translation. \n5\n \u201ewe, by contrast, wish in this work to give a broader meaning to the term of opposition, to all those things, \nI say, which in any way you like are placed facing each other either by nature or by the understanding \n(intellectus), or which in whatever way you please are returned \/ referred each to the other, or which \n[taken] from their own area are placed facing each other, are turned back towards each other and as if by \nthe distance of some diameter look at each other\u201f: \u201eNos vero hoc in proposito latius oppositionis nomen \nextendi volumus, ad ea inquam cuncta, que quomodovis contra sese aut natura aut intellectu statuuntur, \nqueve quomodolibet ad alterutrum referuntur, queve regione sui et adversum se collocantur, in seinvicem \nconvertuntur et velut quodam diametri interstitio in alterutrum spectant\u201f (p. 36, my italics) \n6\n \u201eomnis rerum differitas unitasque\u201f (p. 38). \n 6 \n\u201ecoincidence\u201f and \u201eproportion\u201f of all opposites.7  The art of opposites thus \ngives rise to a creative movement of language, \u201ea productive development of \ndiscourse\u201f;8 as a result, it is even possible to use the human disciplines to \n\u201evoice\u201f in some sense divine mysteries.9  \nTherefore Bovelles\u201fs concept of \u201eopposition\u201f is even broader than the \nAristotelian one, which itself does not necessarily imply antithetical \ndifference. For Bovelles, oppositio can mean simply the relation of two \nthings to one another (or the placing of two things in relation to one \nanother); opposita denotes the two things which are considered in relation to \none another. However, many of the pairs of terms which Bovelles considers \nare in fact antithetical ones, binary pairs such as light and darkness. \nFurthermore, oppositio is used to denote the bringing together of antithetical \nterms such as Deus (God) and nichil (nothing). In this context oppositio is \n                                                 \n7\n p. 32. On gaining knowledge about different disciplines from the square, see also chapter 17.  \n8\n \u201efecunda quedam orationis propagatio\u201f (p. 32). Insofar as he implies the conjunction of knowledge and \ndiscourse, Bovelles\u201fs attitude to Aristotelian logic can be compared to that of logicians like Petrus Ramus. \nBovelles repeats the idea of the productivity of his square: \u201eEt per hec opposite equidistantiam et angulum \nsive intersectionem, latissime de cunctis oppositis philosophari\u201f (\u201eAnd through these opposites, parallelism \nand the angle or intersection, one can philosophise extensively on all opposites\u201f, p. 66, my italics). \n9\n pp. 32-4. Later in Bovelles\u201fs career, he moved further towards speculative theology, and what Lef\u00e8vre \nd\u201fEtaples called \u201eintellectual\u201f philosophy (that is, philosophy based in intuition rather than reason): see \nVictor, pp. 54-5.  \n 7 \naligned with lis (conflict), bellum (war), and discordia (discord; p. 56). \nAlthough Bovelles has said that \u201eopposites\u201f can be any terms in relation with \none another, oppositio also comes to signify antithetical and conflictual \ndifference. Oppositio equivocates between denoting, on the one hand, any \nrelationship between two terms, and, on the other hand, a relationship of \nconflictual binary difference, of \u201ediscord\u201f and \u201ewar\u201f. The term opposita \ncarries similarly contrasting meanings. Thus Bovelles\u201fs vocabulary confuses \nantithetical difference with other kinds of difference and of similarity. Kinds \nof difference cannot be clearly categorised as they are in Aristotelian logic, \nand antithetical difference cannot be clearly distinguished from other kinds. \nBovelles not only broadens the concept of oppositio but also troubles its \nconceptual boundaries. Indeed Bovelles sometimes discusses the very terms \n\u201esame\u201f (idem) and \u201eopposite\u201f (oppositum) \u2013 alongside his discussion of other \npairs such as \u201elight\u201f and \u201edarkness\u201f \u2013 and this gives rise to complex \nstatements about opposition such as \u201eif the same is in the opposite, the \nopposite will be in the same\u201f.10  \nBy contrast with the Ars Oppositorum, Sc\u00e8ve\u201fs D\u00e9lie belongs to a \ngenre in which the primary object of description is supposed to be a lady \n                                                 \n10\n \u201eEt ita in cunctis reperies, si idem eodem fuerit, fore simul oppositum in opposite, et si idem in opposite, \noppositum fore in eodem\u201f (p. 54).  \n 8 \nrather than opposition; unsurprisingly, then, Sc\u00e8ve uses the abstract language \nof difference much less frequently than Bovelles does. However, Sc\u00e8ve does \noccasionally use terms associated with opposition, and, like Bovelles, he \ndoes so in a manner which is far from straightforward. In D124, Apollo is \nevoked as the jealous sun who hides his light in response to the lady\u201fs \nsuperior light. The lady is referred to as Apollo\u201fs contraire, a term which \nimplies absolute difference both generally and also in Aristotelian logic.\n11\n \nYet, while the lady may be superior to the sun, they are also similar since \nboth supposedly emit a bright light. In other words, Sc\u00e8ve uses the \nvocabulary of antithetical difference (contraire) for a relation which \napparently involves a more nuanced type of difference and also similarity. \nLike Bovelles, Sc\u00e8ve seems to question the meaning of antithetical \ndifference and its relationship to other sorts of difference, as if asking \nwhether absolute difference and similarity can somehow co-exist. Both \nSc\u00e8ve and Bovelles use the vocabulary of opposition in a way which implies \nthat its meaning is not self-evident; both, to varying extents, use vocabulary \n                                                 \n11\n It can also have a spatial meaning: Algirdan Julien Greimas and Teresa Mary Keane give a definition of \nit as \u201ede direction oppos\u00e9e\u201f:, Dictionnaire du moyen fran\u00e7ais: la Renaissance (Paris: Larousse, 1992). This, \ntogether with Sc\u00e8ve\u201fs cosmic imagery, suggests that Sc\u00e8ve \u2013 like Bovelles \u2013 thinks of opposition in \npotentially spatial terms; however, developing this line of thought is beyond the scope of this essay.  \n 9 \nfrom logic and yet go beyond or trouble the meanings which such \nvocabulary carries in logic. \n \n \niii) Relations of Opposition and Identity in the D\u00e9lie: The Lady and the \nSun \n \nWhile Sc\u00e8ve does not often use the abstract vocabulary of opposition, I will \nargue that \u2013 by placing particular terms into relations which seem to \nfluctuate between difference, identity, and similarity \u2013 he does question the \ncategorisation of types of difference or opposition, and explore the ways in \nwhich identity and difference might co-exist. I will focus in particular upon \nthe relations of \u201eopposition\u201f between the lady and the sun, which are at issue \nnot only in D124 but in many other dizains. Studies of the cosmos in the \nD\u00e9lie have tended to focus upon the relationship between the ie and the \ncosmos (rather than the lady and the cosmos).\n12\n However, the relationship \n                                                 \n12\n In his Harmonie divine et subjectivit\u00e9 po\u00e9tique chez Maurice Sc\u00e8ve (Geneva: Droz, 2001), James \nHelgeson focuses upon the relationship between the cosmos and the ie, as his title suggests. The lady is part \nof the subject\u201fs relationship with the world, and the subject attempts to force her into the mould of cosmic \nharmony. Hans Staub focused upon the cognitive movement into the world of the ie, and considered the \n 10 \nbetween the lady and the sun is particularly interesting for my purposes here \nbecause it involves complex relations of difference, similarity, and identity. \nSc\u00e8ve is working through specific questions thrown up by the \ndiscourse of love lyric, such as the nature of the similarity between the lady \nand the celestial, as well as the related question of the difference between the \nie and the lady who seems as distant and different from him as the sun is \nfrom the earth. However, in love lyric, desire and difference seem to be a \npriori bound up with one another; indeed other love lyricists also use the \nword contraire to refer to the lady who refuses the poet\u201fs desire.13 Moreover, \nfor Sc\u00e8ve in particular, love seems to be bound up with a difference which \ndefies categorisation in terms of Aristotelian logic.  \nCritics of the D\u00e9lie \u2013 and of love lyric more generally \u2013 often refer to \nthe relationship between the human and the cosmic as if its nature were self-\nevident, as if it were predetermined by a fixed sixteenth-century conception \nof the \u201emicrocosm\u201f: cosmic images are explained with reference to a \nrelationship between the human and the cosmic which, apparently, was \n                                                                                                                                                 \nlady to be united with the ie in this movement: Le Curieux D\u00e9sir: Sc\u00e8ve et Peletier du Mans, po\u00e8tes de la \nconnaissance (Geneva: Droz, 1967), pp. 35-84.  \n13\n Edmond Huguet, Dictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise du seizi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle (Paris, 1925-), 7 vols, p. 487. \n 11 \nuniversally interpreted to be one of similarity.\n14\n This is suggested more \nexplicitly by Hans Staub\u201fs use of a quotation from Cusa to frame his reading \nof the D\u00e9lie: the quotation states that the human behaves like the cosmic but \n\u201ein a human way\u201f, humaniter.15 I would not dispute the idea \u2013 expressed \nmost explicitly by Jean Rousset \u2013 that cosmic images in sixteenth-century \npoetry are ontologically grounded in the relationship between the human and \nthe cosmic.\n16\n However, it does not follow that this relationship was \nconceived in only one fixed and stable way, as a relationship of similarity. I \n                                                 \n14\n For example, Jerry C. Nash considers Sc\u00e8ve\u201fs solar and lunar images to represent a triumph of clarity \nover obscurity, thus implying that cosmic light is simply a symbol of human cognition, thanks to the \nsimilarity between the two; cf. my discussion of the relationship between light and cognition in \u201eThe \nCosmic, the Human, and the Divine: The Role of Poetic Images in Guillaume de Saluste Du Bartas\u201fs \nSepmaine and Maurice Sc\u00e8ve\u201fs D\u00e9lie\u201f (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Cambridge, 2005), Part \nII; my book under preparation, Cosmos and Image in the French Renaissance; and in a second planned \narticle on the D\u00e9lie and the Ars Oppositorum, \u201eDifference, Cognition, and Causality: Maurice Sc\u00e8ve\u201fs D\u00e9lie \nand Charles de Bovelles\u201fs Ars Oppositorum. Critics often refer to the \u201euniverse\u201f of the D\u00e9lie to mean the \nsubjective \u201eworld\u201f of the lover, thus suggesting that the cosmos is not a concern but simply a source of \nimages.

Sometimes the relationship \nbetween the lady and the cosmic light-source is one of similarity or analogy. \nFor example, in D24 the relationship of the ie with the lady resembles the \nrelationship which human beings in general have with cosmic light: the ie is \ndazzled by the lady\u201fs light just as the human eye is dazzled by cosmic light.  \n \nQuand l\u201f\u0153il aux champs est d\u201fesclairs esblouy, \n                                                 \n17\n My study Cosmos and Image is also concerned with difference and similarity in the relationship between \nthe human and the cosmic (and the divine); however, whereas the focus in this essay will be on concepts of \ndifference or opposition, the focus in my book will be on the human, the cosmic, and the divine. Thus the \ntwo projects respond to very different concerns within the same nexus of problems.

There is no confusion between the \ncosmic light and the lady, especially since the ie distinguishes between their \neffects using \u201emais\u201f: the light and the lady are said to be similar but they are \nnot identified with one another; each has its own separate place in the cosmic \nrealm and the human realm respectively.  \nIn the same way, in D386, the sun\u201fs rays resemble D\u00e9lie\u201fs hair, and its \ndazzling midday strength resembles her dazzling eyes, but D\u00e9lie and the sun \nare not represented as being identical: \n \nQuand Apollo apr\u00e8s l\u201fAulbe vermeille \nPoulse le bout de ses rayons dorez, \nSemble \u00e0 mon \u0153il, qui lors point ne sommeille, \n                                                 \n19\n Throughout this essay I cite G\u00e9rard Defaux\u201fs edition of the D\u00e9lie (Geneva: Droz, 2004). \n 14 \nVeoir les cheveulx, de ce Monde adorez, \nQui par leurs noudz de mes mortz decorez \nM\u201font \u00e0 ce joug jusqu\u201f\u00e0 ma fin conduyct. \n   Et quand apr\u00e8s \u00e0 plaine face il luyt, \nIl m\u201fest advis, que ie voy clerement \nLes yeulx, desquelz la clart\u00e9 tant me nuyt,  \nQu\u201felle esblouyt ma veue entierement.  \n \nIn these dizains, D\u00e9lie\u201fs resemblance to the sun is congruent with a \nconception of the human-cosmos relation as one of analogy or similarity: the \nlady is apparently a human equivalent of the sun, performing a similar role \nfor the poetic subject as the sun performs in the cosmos. These dizains fit \nwith the notion that the human is similar to the cosmic, and with Staub\u201fs \nCusan reading in which the human resembles the universe but \u201ein a human \nway\u201f.  \nHowever, the D\u00e9lie does not always reiterate this particular \nconception of the relationship between the human realm and the cosmos. In \nother dizains the lady and the sun are conflated. For example, D92 opens in \na similar manner to D386 in that the sun makes it seem to the ie as if he sees \nthe lady who startles and dazzles him; as in D386, the sun is similar to D\u00e9lie \nyet separate from her. However, when, in the final two lines of the dizain, \n 15 \nthe poet evokes \u201etel Soleil\u201f, these words could denote the solar body itself or \ncould have come to refer to the lady:  \n \nSur nostre chef gettant Phebus ses rayz, \nFaisoit bouillir de son cler jour la None : \nAdvis me fut de veoir en son taint frais \nCelle, de qui la rencontre m\u201festonne, \nDe qui la voix si fort en l\u201fame tonne : \nQue ne puis d\u201felle un seul doulx mot ouir : \nEt de qui l\u201foeil vient ma veue esblouir, \nTant qu\u201faultre n\u201fest, fors elle, \u00e0 mes yeux belle.  \n   Me pourra donc tel Soleil resjouir, \nQuand tout Mydi m\u201fest nuict, voire eternelle ? \n \nIn the opening lines, the ie tells us that when the sun shines in the late \nafternoon (\u201ela None\u201f), he imagines that he sees the lady; then, in the final \ntwo lines, he wonders whether \u201esuch a sun\u201f (\u201etel Soleil\u201f) can bring him joy, \nwhen every midday is to him eternal night. The argument of these final two \nlines might be construed as follows: the poet will be unable to gain joy from \nthe sun (the cosmic body) because of the love for his lady which he has \nevoked in lines 3-8. In this reading, \u201etel Soleil\u201f would refer to the solar \ncosmic body, as one would usually expect. However, the potential absence \nof joy from \u201etel Soleil\u201f results from the fact that \u201etout Mydi m\u201fest nuict, \nvoire eternelle\u201f (l. 10): therefore, since literal cosmic midday could not in \n 16 \nany real sense be either night or eternal, \u201etel Soleil\u201f does not seem to refer \nliterally to the cosmic solar body. In addition, the idea of midday being night \nrecalls the notion of a light so dazzling that it casts the ie into darkness, and \nsuch a light figures in the D\u00e9lie as an image of the lady, for example in D386 \n(quoted on page 13) and D51 (quoted on page 17); indeed in D92 itself the \nlady has been evoked in her dazzling role (l. 7), whereas the actual cosmic \nsun was in \u201ela None\u201f, the fourth quarter of the day, rather than at midday. So, \n\u201etel Soleil\u201f seems to refer to the lady whose gaze might dazzle the poet into \ndarkness, or \u201eturn \u201cmidday\u201d into \u201cnight\u201d\u201f. Moreover, in D92 it is only the ie \nwho is said to experience midday as eternal night (\u201etout Mydi m\u201fest nuict\u201f): \nthis suggests that it is his \u201esun\u201f \u2013 the lady \u2013 who is here referred to as a \n\u201eSoleil\u201f. On the other hand, in this particular dizain, the lady has not \npreviously been referred to as a sun, and her dazzling gaze has not been \nforegrounded but rather features as only one of a list of her attributes: thus \nthe reader does not necessarily have in mind an image of her as a sun, \nwhereas the poet has definitely created an image of the cosmic sun casting \nits rays. So, by contrast with references to the sun in dizains 24 and 386, the \nexpression \u201etel Soleil\u201f does not refer unambiguously to either the sun or the \nlady. \n 17 \nThus, in D92, \u201etel Soleil\u201f has attributes of the lady (casting the ie into \ndarkness), so that \u201eSoleil\u201f equivocates between referring to the solar cosmic \nbody or to the supposedly human lady. Although D92 begins by comparing \nthe lady and the sun to one another, by the end of the dizain there seems to \nbe only one \u201esun\u201f. There is not an equivalent \u201euniverse\u201f in the human realm \nwhich resembles the cosmic \u201euniverse\u201f: this is not an analogic relation \nbetween cosmos and human in which the sun and the lady would be similar \nyet nonetheless clearly maintain their difference. Instead, the macrocosm and \nthe microcosm are collapsed onto the same signifiers. The sun and the lady \nof whom the sun reminds the ie seem to become one. In the same way, D51 \nbegins by explicitly comparing the sun and the lady (or, at least, \u201esi grand \nbeault\u00e9\u201f), but then proceeds to a discussion which is apparently of the lady, \nyet which uses so much solar vocabulary that the sun and the lady seem to \nhave merged into one, or to occupy the same place:  \n   \nSi grand beault\u00e9, mais bien si grand merveille,  \nQui \u00e0 Phebus offusque sa clart\u00e9, \nSoit que ie sois present, ou escart\u00e9, \nDe sorte l\u201fame en sa lueur m\u201fesveille, \nQu\u201fil m\u201fest advis en dormant, que ie veille, \nEt qu\u201fen son jour un espoir ie prevoy, \nQui de bien brief, sans deslay, ou envoy, \nM\u201fesclercira mes pens\u00e9es funebres.  \n 18 \n   Mais quand sa face en son Mydy ie voy, \nA tous clart\u00e9, et \u00e0 moy rend tenebres.  \n \nHere the lady is not cosmic \u201ein a human way\u201f (\u201ehumaniter\u201f) but literally is \nthe cosmic.  \n Of course it is common poetic practice for the second pole of a \ncomparison to be implicit and unexplained so that, for example, a poet says \n\u201esun\u201f and means \u201elady\u201f. However, Sc\u00e8ve moves between explicit comparison \nof the lady and the sun \u2013 implying their similarity yet separate existences \u2013 \nand implicit \u201ecomparison\u201f, or conflation of the lady and the sun onto the \nsame signifiers. In other words, it is not simply that Sc\u00e8ve uses solar \nvocabulary for his lady: rather he evokes and compares the sun and the lady, \nthen confuses them so that the solar vocabulary might refer to either or both. \nHe compares them, referring to their differences and similarities, but then \nconflates them, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Thus, I \nwould suggest that, rather than being ontologically grounded in the notion of \na relationship between the human and the cosmos based in similarity, \nSc\u00e8ve\u201fs cosmic images explore the nature of that relationship by \nreconstruing it as one of similarity and difference, then as one of identity. \nThis reconfigures the same relationship as one of difference and one of \n 19 \nidentity, and undermines any sense that one should be able to define \nrelationships in terms of difference or of identity exclusively.   \n Furthermore, other relationships of difference and similarity are also \nimplicated in the shifting relations between the lady and the sun. If we \naccept that the solar signifiers in D9 refer to the sun as well as to the lady, \nthen the midday sun is conflated with a different \u2013 even opposite (in the \nsense of antithetical) \u2013 point on the cosmic cycle: night. Furthermore, these \nopposites are in turn conflated with the eternal, which one can think of as \n\u201econtaining\u201f all temporal points. The \u201esun\u201f merges with its opposite as a \nresult of the equivocation of \u201esoleil\u201f between referring to the sun and \nreferring to the lady. In other words, the lady\u201fs shifting relationship of \nsimilarity and sameness to the sun in a sense changes the sun: that is, as a \nresult of being in a shifting relation of difference with the lady, the sun \nbecomes different, or opposed to itself.  \n A similar process is arguably at work in D124, the dizain in which the \nlady is referred to as Apollo\u201fs \u201econtraire\u201f:  \n \nSi Apollo restrainct ses raiz dorez, \nSe marrissant tout honteux soubz la nue, \nC\u201fest par les tiens de ce Monde adorez, \nDesquelz l\u201for pur sa clart\u00e9 diminue. \n   Parquoy soubdain, qu\u201ficy tu es venue, \n 20 \nEstant sur toy, son contraire, envieux, \nA congel\u00e9 ce Brouas pluvieux, \nPour contrelustre \u00e0 ta divine face. \nMais ton tainct frais vainct la neige des cieulx, \nComme le jour la clere nuict efface. \n \nThe lady and the sun, Apollo, are similar in their brightness, although the \nlady\u201fs brightness is superior. Furthermore, the lady is, in line 10, compared \nto the sun, or at least to \u201ele jour\u201f. However, as we have seen, despite her \nsimilarity to Apollo, the lady is described as Apollo\u201fs \u201eopposite\u201f, his \n\u201econtraire\u201f (l. 6). Moreover, it is suggested that the lady\u201fs brightness \ndiminishes that of Apollo. Finally, when the lady is aligned with \u201ele jour\u201f, \nthe sun (Apollo) is implicitly aligned with the \u201eneige des cieulx\u201f and even \u201ela \nclere nuict\u201f. Despite being similar to the lady, Apollo does seem to become \nsomething like her \u201econtraire\u201f and, moreover, is also something like his own \n\u201econtraire\u201f, the night. Once again, a dizain opens by referring to a \nrelationship of similarity between the lady and the sun, yet by the end of the \ndizain solar signifiers (in this case jour) have come to refer to the lady, and \nthe sun has implicitly become something different from \u2013 or even opposite \nto \u2013 itself: complex relations of difference are introduced into the sun by the \nsame token that they exist in the relationship between the lady and the sun. \n 21 \nAs in D92, a resemblance between the lady and the sun undermines the \nsun\u201fs sameness to itself and perhaps also its opposition to night. \n \n \niv) Relations of Opposition and Identity in the Ars Oppositorum \n \nBy occupying the place of the sun, the lady troubles the cosmic hierarchy in \nwhich the solar should be higher than the human and opposite to the night. \nBovelles also connects conflictual oppositio with undoing this hierarchy: \noppositio reverses the hierarchy so that earth is high and fire is low (p. 58). \nMoreover, the interaction between different pairs of terms \u2013 which I have \ndescribed in the D\u00e9lie \u2013 is discussed more explicitly by Bovelles. In the \nD\u00e9lie, then, the relations of difference between one pair of terms (the sun \nand the lady) affect the relationship between another pair (night and day). \nBovelles\u201fs theoretical text is also concerned with how pairs of \u201eopposites\u201f \nfunction and interact: in the Ars Oppositorum, the relation between a pair of \nopposites is redefined by their relation to another pair of opposites. Bovelles \ndescribes how opposites \u2013 such as Deus (God) and nichil (nothing) \u2013 partake \nnot only in a relation of opposition to each other but also in relations of \nsameness with other terms: thus Deus is in a relation of sameness with esse \n 22 \n(being), and nichil is in a relation of sameness with non esse (not being). \nBovelles represents these relationships diagrammatically, as shown in fig. 1. \nDeus and esse are linked by a \u201eline of identity\u201f, as are nichil and non esse. \nBy contrast, \u201elines of opposition\u201f link Deus to non esse, and nichil to esse \n(p. 64). Bovelles explains that these \u201elines of opposition\u201f give rise to four \nmore, since the two angles formed by their intersections form four further \nlines of opposition (p. 66). However, the relations of \u201eopposition\u201f \nrepresented by these additional lines \u201eoppose\u201f Deus and esse, which are also \njoined by a \u201eline of identity\u201f, and which one would not expect to be opposed \n(at least if \u201eopposition\u201f is conceived, as it is here, as diversity and discord \nrather than simply as a relation): \n \nSimilarly all the lines which form an angle, like those which go from God to both being and non-\nbeing, or from nothing to both being and non-being, or from God and nothing to being, or from \nGod and nothing to non-being, are called lines of opposition, diversity, and discord.\n20\n \n \nThus, the relation of identity or opposition between a pair of terms is altered \nby the placing of that pair in a relation with another pair, so that some terms \nare \u201ejoined\u201f to one another by both identity and opposition. \n                                                 \n20\n \u201eSimiliter et quecunque faciunt angulum ut que a deo simul ad esse et non esse, vel que a nichilo ad esse \net non esse, aut que a deo et nichilo ad esse, aut a deo et nichilo ad non esse producuntur, he oppositionis \ndiversitatis et discordie line vocitentur\u201f (p. 66). \n 23 \n This is rather like the process I have analysed in the D\u00e9lie. Indeed one \nmight place the pairs \u201eie\u201f and \u201elady\u201f, and \u201esun\u201f (or \u201eiour\u201f) and \u201enight\u201f (or \n\u201edarkness\u201f) into Bovelles\u201fs diagram in place of Deus and nichil, and esse and \nnon esse; after all, Bovelles suggests that his Ars can be used to find \nknowledge about all sorts of pairs of opposites. In fig. 2, I have joined \u201elady\u201f \nand \u201esun\u201f with a \u201eline of identity\u201f, since these two terms are similar; likewise \n\u201eie\u201f and \u201enight\u201f can be joined with a \u201eline of identity\u201f, since the ie often \nbemoans his state of darkness which results from his encounter with the \nlady-sun. While \u201eidentity\u201f seems too strong a term for those instances where \nthe lady and the sun (or ie and darkness) are simply said to be alike, it is \nappropriate for the instances where they are conflated.  As a result of \ninserting these terms into the square, the lady and the sun become joined \nsimultaneously by identity and by opposition, something which also happens \nin the very different context of the D\u00e9lie. One could also place \u201esun\u201f and \n\u201enight\u201f into the diagram so that they were joined by lines of both opposition \nand identity. Therefore opposition functions in similarly paradoxical ways in \nboth the theoretical text and the poetic one: both Sc\u00e8ve and Bovelles suggest \nthat, as part of a dynamic relation between pairs of terms, opposition can co-\nexist with identity, and the existence of one relation can create the other.  \n 24 \n As well as pointing to the dynamic nature of the relationship between \ndifferent pairs of opposites, Bovelles also \u2013 like Sc\u00e8ve \u2013 breaks down \nantithetical differences between binary pairs like darkness and light: I \nobserved earlier that, despite Bovelles\u201fs inclusive definition of opposites, he \nuses many antithetical pairs, but, furthermore, he is also interested in \nbreaking down antithetical differences, in uniting opposites. Bovelles uses \nthe square of opposites to generate propositions, showing how it produces: \n\u201etruth is true truth\u201f, \u201efalseness is true falseness\u201f, \u201etruth is false falseness\u201f, and \n\u201efalseness is false truth\u201f. He then \u2013 presumably following his stated principle \nof proceeding from knowledge in one discipline to knowledge in another \u2013 \nsimilarly produces a set of statements concerning light and darkness: \u201elight is \nluminous light\u201f; \u201elight is dark darkness\u201f; \u201edarkness is light darkness\u201f; and, \n\u201edarkness is dark light\u201f (pp. 120-2). While one might be able to construct \nsome sort of commonsensical meaning from the propositions concerning \ntruth and falsity, the statement that \u201elight is dark darkness\u201f has no obviously \ncomprehensible meaning. Thus, like Sc\u00e8ve, Bovelles not only uses the \nvocabulary of antithetical difference for \u201eoppositions\u201f which involve \nsimilarity or even identity, but he also has a strong interest in breaking down \nantithetical differences and in making opposites coincide. His statement that \n 25 \n\u201elight is darkness\u201f recalls the simultaneity of opposites in the D\u00e9lie where \nmidday is night. \nAs we have seen, in the D\u00e9lie it is the lady who introduces such \ncomplex differences into the world. In addition, the breaking down of \nopposites may have something to do with her \u201edivinity\u201f. In D92, the \nconflated opposites of day and night are in turn conflated with the eternal: \n\u201eMe pourra donc tel Soleil resjouir, \/ Quand tout Mydi m\u201fest nuict, voire \neternelle?\u201f More generally, like all Petrarchist ladies, Sc\u00e8ve\u201fs lady has \nattributes not only of the cosmic but also of the divine; furthermore, \narguably more so than in other contemporary French love lyricists, Biblical \nand theological language is used to refer to her and to the lover\u201fs \nrelationship with her.\n21\n It is thanks to this divinised lady that oppositions are \nundermined or rendered complex and paradoxical. \n                                                 \n21\n On Biblical language in the D\u00e9lie, and its connections to evangelist discourse, see Kathryn Banks, \u201eThe \nCosmic, the Human, and the Divine\u201f, Part II, and Cosmos and Image in the French Renaissance; Marc \nGraff, \u201eNombres et Embl\u00e8mes dans la \u201cD\u00e9lie\u201d\u201f, R\u00e9forme, Humanisme, Renaissance: Bulletin de \nl\u2019Association d\u2019\u00c9tude sur l\u2019Humanisme, la R\u00e9forme et la Renaissance (France du centre et du sud-est), 12 \n(1980), pp. 5-12; Jerry C.

Another focus for further study is that both \ntexts explore opposition\u201fs relationship not only with the divine but also with \nthe human: both express a deep interest in the relationship between \ndifference and the human subject, and in the respective roles of nature and \n                                                 \n23\n For Bri\u00e7onnet\u201fs representation of the coincidence of light and darkness, see, for example, letter six from \nBri\u00e7onnet to Marguerite de Navarre, in Guillaume Bri\u00e7onnet.

I would argue that, for both \nwriters, causality and cognition seem to overlap in function, as if human \nattempts to establish difference might actually alter the world; yet, in the \nD\u00e9lie the ie suffers intensely from difference, whereas, in the Ars, the human \nsubject is privileged above the natural world in his relationship with \ndifference. I will discuss these issues in a future essay but, as far as this one \nis concerned, I have aimed to demonstrate that the D\u00e9lie and the Ars share an \ninterest in undermining antithetical difference, in confusing it with other \nmodes of difference, and ultimately in challenging the way we conceive of \ndifferences and identities.   \n  \n 29 \n \nFig. 1 \n  \n \nFig. 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
