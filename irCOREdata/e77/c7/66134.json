Introduction\nLattices in rank one symmetric spaces have been studied for a long time with important\nresults concerning rigidity and arithmeticity. Among symmetric spaces, the complex\nball is a particularly challenging case. In particular, very few examples of lattices\nhave been constructed. Perhaps the first example for the complex two-dimensional\nball, the group PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]) \u2282 PU(2, 1), is due to Picard [Pi1], [Pi2]; here \u03c9 =\n(\u22121 + i \u221a3)\/2 is a primitive cube root of unity (see Sections 2, 3 for notation).\nThis group generalises the modular group PSL(2,Z) in complex dimension one. We\ncall PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]) the Eisenstein-Picard modular group due to the important role of\nEisenstein integers Z[\u03c9].\nOur goal in this article is to obtain a fundamental domain for the Eisenstein-\nPicard group along with a presentation. Of course, fundamental domains exist and\nwere studied in some generality (see [GR]), but the actual construction of a concrete\nexample is not easy. Curiously, this has not yet been done for the Eisenstein-Picard\ngroup, maybe because the simplest way to obtain fundamental domains\u2014namely, by\nthe Dirichlet method\u2014gives rise to combinatorially complicated objects.\nStudies of lattices using Dirichlet fundamental domains were made by Giraud\n[G] and Mostow [M]. The calculations are difficult because bisectors are not totally\ngeodesic submanifolds, and, in fact, Mostow used computers. Moreover, it is not clear\nwhether his proof is independent of some numerical analysis (see the discussion in\n[D]). Other fundamental domains for Mostow\u2019s groups are given in [DFP].\nIn this article, we abandon Dirichlet domains and instead construct a remarkably\nsimple fundamental domain. In fact, it is the simplest possible combinatorial structure,\nbeing a 4-simplex with one ideal vertex (the group has only one cusp) inside the two-\ndimensional complex ball H2\nC\n(see Theorem 5.9). In fact, we construct the Ford domain\nwith a centre parabolic fixed point, that is, the intersection of the exteriors of isometric\nspheres of all elements not fixing infinity. As is well known, the Ford domain is a\nfundamental domain for the coset space of \u0002\u221e (the parabolic group stabilising the\nideal vertex; see, e.g., [L, page 58]). In order to construct a fundamental domain, we\nmust intersect the Ford domain with a fundamental domain for \u0002\u221e. The fact that our\nfundamental domain is a simplex follows from the fact that there is a single \u0002\u221e-orbit of\nisometric spheres with maximal radius, and the boundary of the Ford domain consists\nof \u0002\u221e-equivalent tetrahedral faces. This leads us to a choice of fundamental domain\nfor \u0002\u221e, namely, the geodesic cone from the boundary of one of these tetrahedra to the\ncentre of the Ford domain.\nThis construction is completely analogous to the famous 2-simplex with one ideal\nvertex which is the fundamental domain for the classical modular group PSL(2,Z)\nin the hyperbolic plane H1\nC\n. The proofs we give, wherever possible, follow those for\nPSL(2,Z) (see [L, pages 59 \u2013 60]; readers may find it helpful to keep this example in\nmind). For PSL(2,Z), the boundary of the Ford domain consists of arcs of Euclidean\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 251\ncircles with radius 1 centred at the integers. These arcs are equivalent under the action\nof integer translations, and so a fundamental domain for PSL(2,Z) is obtained by\nintersecting the Ford domain with a strip of (Euclidean) width 1. If this strip is centred\non an integer, then the resulting domain is a hyperbolic triangle. Moreover, it is the\ngeodesic cone from infinity to one of the edges of the Ford domain.\nThe relation between the groups PSL(2,Z) and PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]) is given in Propo-\nsition 5.10; PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]) is obtained from a representation of PSL(2,Z) by adjoining\none element (see also [FP]). Finally, we show that as well as its geometric presentation,\nthe Eisenstein-Picard modular group admits a presentation with two generators (see\nProposition 5.11). Furthermore, this presentation falls into the same pattern as the\nfamily of the groups constructed by Mostow in [M] (see Corollary 5.13).\nThe orbifold H2\nC\n\/PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]) has volume \u03c02\/27 (this follows from the work\nof Holzapfel; see [H1, page 151]). This is conjectured to be the smallest volume of\na cusped, complex hyperbolic orbifold. The fact that the Eisenstein-Picard group is\na basic lattice in complex dimension two is also shown by the fact that a smallest-\nvolume complex hyperbolic two-manifold can be obtained from an index 72 subgroup\nof the Eisenstein-Picard group (see [P1]). These facts are again direct analogies of the\ncorresponding results for PSL(2,Z).\nOur construction uses bisectors (see [M] and [Go]) and a version of Poincare\u00b4\u2019s\npolyhedron theorem, following [M]. It involves a careful study of a fundamental\ndomain for the parabolic subgroup fixing the cusp inside the Heisenberg group that is\nthe ideal boundary of complex hyperbolic space. The finite face of our polyhedron is\ncontained in an isometric sphere (that is, a vertical bisector; see [Go, Section 5.1.9]),\nbut all four faces containing the ideal vertex are not contained in a bisector; rather,\nthey are contained in the geodesic cone over a lower-dimensional face. A different\nconstruction of a fundamental polyhedron for the Eisenstein-Picard modular group is\ngiven in [P2]. This polyhedron consists of two simplices with a common face, and so it\nhas eight faces. The advantage of this construction is that all eight faces are contained\nin bisectors.\nThe other Picard modular groups are PU(2, 1; Od ), where Od is the ring of in-\ntegers in the imaginary quadratic number field Q(i\u221ad) for any positive square-free\ninteger d. It would be interesting to find a strategy to obtain fundamental domains for\nPU(2, 1; Od ), as was done by Swan [Sw] for the Bianchi groups PSL(2,Od ).\n2.

(2)\nIf A fixes q\u221e, then it is upper triangular. We now examine the subgroup of PU(2, 1)\nfixing q\u221e. First, for (z0, t0) \u2208 N, Heisenberg translation by (z0, t0) is given by\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f01 \u2212z0\n\u2212|z0|2 + it0\n2\n0 1 z0\n0 0 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb .\nAny Heisenberg translation by (0, t0) \u2208 N is called a vertical translation.\nFor ei\u03b8 \u2208 S1, Heisenberg rotation by \u03b8 fixing the complex line (0, t, u) \u2282 H2\nC\nis\ngiven by \uf8ee\n\uf8f01 0 00 ei\u03b8 0\n0 0 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nAll other Heisenberg rotations fixing q\u221e may be obtained from such a map by conju-\ngating by a Heisenberg translation.\nFor \u03bb \u2208 R+, Heisenberg dilation by \u03bb fixing q\u221e and qo = (0, 0, 0) \u2208 \u2202H2C is\ngiven by \uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u03bb 0 00 1 0\n0 0 \u03bb\u22121\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nAll other Heisenberg dilations fixing q\u221e may be obtained by conjugating by a Heisen-\nberg translation.\nAll Heisenberg rotations and translations preserve each horosphere based at q\u221e,\nbut all nontrivial Heisenberg dilations map each horosphere in H2\nC\nto another one. The\ngroup generated by all Heisenberg translations, rotations, and dilations is the stabiliser\nof q\u221e in PU(2, 1). The Heisenberg isometry group Isom(N) is the subgroup generated\nby all Heisenberg translations and rotations. We can write Isom(N) as N \u0001 U(1). In\nparticular, each element of Isom(N) preserves every horosphere.\nWe define vertical projection \u0007 : N \u2212\u2192 C by \u0007 : (z, t) \n\u2212\u2192 z. Using the exact\nsequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 N \u0007\u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2192 0,\n254 FALBEL and PARKER\nwe obtain the exact sequence (see Scott [S, page 467])\n0 \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 Isom(N) \u0007\u2217\u2212\u2192 Isom(C) \u2212\u2192 1. (3)\nHere Isom(C) is the group of orientation-preserving Euclidean isometries of C.\nObserve that elements in Isom(C) can be represented by matrices in GL(2,C) of\nthe form [\nei\u03b8 z0\n0 1\n] [\nz\n1\n]\n=\n[\nei\u03b8 z + z0\n1\n]\n.\nTherefore, the map \u0007\u2217 can be explicitly given by\n\u0007\u2217 :\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f01 \u2212z0e\ni\u03b8 \u2212|z0|2 + it0\n2\n0 ei\u03b8 z0\n0 0 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb \u2212\u2192 [ei\u03b8 z00 1\n]\n.

Isometric spheres\nGiven an element A \u2208 PU(2, 1) such that A(q\u221e) \u000b= q\u221e, we define the isometric sphere\nof A to be the hypersurface{\nz \u2208 H2\nC\n: |\u3008z, q\u221e\u3009| = |\u3008z,A\u22121(q\u221e)\u3009|\n}\n.\nFor example,\nS0 =\n{(z, t, u) : \u2223\u2223|z|2 + u + it\u2223\u2223 = 2} (5)\nis the isometric sphere of\nR =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f00 0 10 \u22121 0\n1 0 0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nBoth the isometric sphere S0 and the map R play crucial roles in our constructions.\nAll other isometric spheres are images of S0 by Heisenberg dilations, rotations, and\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 255\ntranslations. Thus the isometric sphere with radius r and centre (z0, t0, 0) is given by{(z, t, u) : \u2223\u2223|z \u2212 z0|2 + u + it \u2212 it0 + 2i Im(zz0)\u2223\u2223 = r2}. (6)\n(The factor r2 in this expression is because we are using the Cygan metric to measure\nthe radius; see, e.g., [P1].) Thus if A has the form (2), then A(q\u221e) \u000b= q\u221e if and only if\ng \u000b= 0. The isometric sphere of A has radius r = \u221a2\/|g| and centre A\u22121(q\u221e), which\nin horospherical coordinates is\n(z0, t0, 0) =\n(\nh\ng\n, 2Im\n(j\ng\n)\n, 0\n)\n.\nIsometric spheres are examples of bisectors and, as such, have a very nice foliation\nby two different families of totally geodesic submanifold. There is a geodesic called\nthe spine of the bisector. Mostow [M] showed that a bisector is the preimage of the\nspine under orthogonal projection onto the unique complex line containing the spine.\nThe fibres of this projection are complex lines called the slices of the bisector. Goldman\n[Go] showed that a bisector is the union of all totally real Lagrangian planes containing\nthe spine. Such Lagrangian planes are called the meridians. Together the slices and\nmeridians give geographical coordinates on the bisector. Specifically, we begin by\nwriting |z|2 + u \u2212 it = 2ei\u03b8 for \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0\/2, \u03c0\/2] (this ensures that |z|2 + u \u2265 0); in\nparticular, |z| \u2264 \u221a2 cos(\u03b8). We also write z in polar coordinates, and we choose its\nargument in a way that is adapted to the decomposition ofS0 into meridians. We achieve\nthis by writing z = rei\u03b1+i\u03b8\/2 for r \u2208 [\u2212\u221a2 cos(\u03b8),\u221a2 cos(\u03b8)] and \u03b1 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0\/2, \u03c0\/2).\nWe remark that it might seem more natural to keep r nonnegative and allow \u03b1 to vary\nover [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0). As we show in Proposition 2.1, we made this choice so that meridians\nof S0 correspond to a fixed \u03b1. In geographical coordinates, S0 is given by\nS0 =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 \u2212ei\u03b8rei\u03b1+i\u03b8\/2\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb : \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212 \u03c0\n2\n,\n\u03c0\n2\n]\n, \u03b1 \u2208\n[\n\u2212 \u03c0\n2\n,\n\u03c0\n2\n)\n,\nr \u2208 [\u2212\n\u221a\n2 cos(\u03b8),\n\u221a\n2 cos(\u03b8)]\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\n\uf8fe . (7)\nIn horospherical coordinates, the point of S0 with geographical coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03b1)\nis given by (rei\u03b1+i\u03b8\/2,\u22122 sin(\u03b8), 2 cos(\u03b8) \u2212 r2).\nWe now find the spine, slices, and meridians of S0 in terms of geographical\ncoordinates.\n256 FALBEL and PARKER\nPROPOSITION 2.1\nThe isometric sphere S0 with coordinates given by (7) is a bisector. Moreover,\n\u0001 the spine of S0 is given by r = 0;\n\u0001 the slices of S0 are given by \u03b8 = \u03b80 for fixed \u03b80 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0\/2, \u03c0\/2];\n\u0001 the meridians of S0 are given by \u03b1 = \u03b10 for fixed \u03b10 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0\/2, \u03c0\/2).\nProof\nAll isometric spheres are bisectors. The spine of S0 is given by the intersection of the\nbisector with its complex spine, that is, the complex line spanned by q\u221e and R(q\u221e).\nThis complex line has equation z = 0, and the first part follows.\nGiven a point (0,\u22122 sin(\u03b80), 2 cos(\u03b80)) on the spine of S0, the slice through this\npoint is given by the inverse image of orthogonal projection onto the complex spine.\nSuch points are given by \uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u2212ei\u03b80z\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb \u2208 P(V\u2212)\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\n\uf8fe .\nThe second part follows immediately.\nThe meridians of S0 are the fixed-point loci of antiholomorphic involutions fixing\nthe spine. For \u03b10 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0\/2, \u03c0\/2), these maps are given by\n\u03b9\u03b10 :\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0z1z2\nz3\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb \n\u2212\u2192\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 z3\u2212e2i\u03b10z2\nz1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nApplying \u03b9\u03b10 to a point of S0 and taking horospherical coordinates, we obtain\n\u03b9\u03b10\n(\nrei\u03b1+i\u03b8\/2,\u22122 sin(\u03b8), 2 cos(\u03b8) \u2212 r2) = (re2i\u03b10\u2212i\u03b1+i\u03b8\/2,\u22122 sin(\u03b8), 2 cos(\u03b8) \u2212 r2).\nTherefore, the meridian fixed by \u03b9\u03b10 is given by \u03b1 = \u03b10. \u0001\n3. The Eisenstein-Picard modular group\nLet Od be the ring of integers in the imaginary quadratic number field Q(i\n\u221a\nd), where\nd is a positive square-free integer. If d \u2261 1, 2 (mod 4), then Od = Z[i\n\u221a\nd], and if\nd \u2261 3 (mod 4), then Od = Z[(1 + i\n\u221a\nd)\/2]. The subgroup of PU(2, 1) with entries in\nOd is called the Picard modular group for Od and is written PU(2, 1; Od ) (see [H2]). (In\nfact, [H2] uses a different Hermitian form. However, the two Picard modular groups\nare conjugate; see [P1, page 452].)\nWe are only interested in the case where d = 3. Let \u03c9 denote the cube root of\nunity (\u22121 + i\u221a3)\/2. Then O3 = Z[\u03c9] is the set of Eisenstein integers. Thus the Picard\nmodular group in this case is \u0002 = PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]), which we call the Eisenstein-Picard\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 257\nmodular group. The goal of this section is to prove Theorem 3.5, which gives genera-\ntors for PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]). In later sections, we go on to give a presentation.\n3.1. The stabiliser of q\u221e\nFirst, we want to analyse \u0002\u221e, the stabiliser of q\u221e in \u0002 = PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]). Every\nelement of \u0002\u221e is upper triangular, and its diagonal entries are units in Z[\u03c9]. Therefore,\n\u0002\u221e contains no dilations and so is a subgroup of Isom(N); thus it fits into the exact\nsequence (3) as\n0 \u2212\u2192 R \u2229 \u0002\u221e \u2212\u2192 \u0002\u221e \u0007\u2217\u2212\u2192 \u0007\u2217(\u0002\u221e) \u2212\u2192 1.\nWe now find the image and kernel in this exact sequence.\nPROPOSITION 3.1\nThe stabiliser \u0002\u221e of q\u221e in \u0002 = PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]) satisfies\n0 \u2212\u2192 2\n\u221a\n3 Z \u2212\u2192 \u0002\u221e \u0007\u2217\u2212\u2192 \n(2, 3, 6) \u2192 1,\nwhere \n(2, 3, 6) denotes the triangle group comprising orientation-preserving sym-\nmetries of Z[\u03c9].\nProof\nFrom our explicit construction (4) of \u0007\u2217, we see that for A \u2208 \u0002\u221e,\n\u0007\u2217(A) =\n[(\u2212\u03c9)m z0\n0 1\n]\n,\nwhere z0 \u2208 Z[\u03c9]. Thus \u0007\u2217(\u0002\u221e) is the group of orientation-preserving symmetries of\nZ[\u03c9] \u2282 C. This is well known to be the triangle group \n(2, 3, 6).\nLikewise, the kernel of \u0007\u2217 is easily seen to consist of those vertical translations\nin \u0002, that is, Heisenberg translations by (0, 2\u221a3 n) \u2208 N for n \u2208 Z. \u0001\nThis enables us to find generators for \u0002\u221e.\nPROPOSITION 3.2\n\u0002\u221e is generated by\nP =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f01 1 \u03c90 \u03c9 \u2212\u03c9\n0 0 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , Q =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f01 1 \u03c90 \u22121 1\n0 0 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb . (8)\n258 FALBEL and PARKER\nProof\nThe triangle group \n(2, 3, 6) is generated by\n\u0007\u2217(P ) : z \n\u2212\u2192 \u03c9z \u2212 \u03c9, \u0007\u2217(Q) : z \n\u2212\u2192 \u2212z + 1.\nHence we only need to show that P and Q generate R \u2229 \u0002\u221e = 2\n\u221a\n3 Z.

(9)\nThis is precisely the generator of R \u2229 \u0002\u221e = 2\n\u221a\n3 Z. \u0001\nAs a first step toward the construction of a fundamental domain for the Eisenstein-\nPicard modular group \u0002, we construct a fundamental domain for the parabolic sub-\ngroup \u0002\u221e acting on the Heisenberg group. As \u0002\u221e preserves horospheres, a fundamen-\ntal domain for \u0002\u221e acting on H2C is obtained by taking the bundle of vertical geodesics\n(in horospherical coordinates) over a fundamental domain in the Heisenberg group. In\nother words, the fundamental domain in H2\nC\nis the geodesic cone over a fundamental\ndomain in N.\nWe want to describe the action of P and Q on each horosphere. To do so, we\nuse the identification (1) between N\u00d7 R+ = (C \u00d7 R) \u00d7 R+ and a subset of complex\nprojective space. Then using the matrices (8), we obtain the following action of P ,\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f01 1 \u03c90 \u03c9 \u2212\u03c9\n0 0 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u2212|z|2 \u2212 u+ it\n2\nz\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u2212|z|2 \u2212 u+ it\n2 + z+\u03c9\n\u03c9z \u2212 \u03c9\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n=\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u2212|\u03c9z\u2212\u03c9|2 \u2212 u+ it + 2i Im(z) + i\u221a3\n2\n\u03c9z \u2212 \u03c9\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb ,\nand Q,\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f01 1 \u03c90 \u22121 1\n0 0 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u2212|z|2 \u2212 u+ it\n2\nz\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u2212|z|2 \u2212 u+ it\n2 + z+\u03c9\n\u2212z + 1\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n=\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u2212|\u2212 z+ 1|2 \u2212 u+ it + 2i Im(z) + i\u221a3\n2\n\u2212z + 1\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb .\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 259\nTherefore, in horospherical coordinates,\nP : (z, t, u) \n\u2212\u2192 (\u03c9z \u2212 \u03c9, t + 2 Im(z) + \u221a3, u)\nand\nQ : (z, t, u) \n\u2212\u2192 (\u2212z + 1, t + 2 Im(z) + \u221a3, u).\nThis action preserves each horosphere, that is, the set of points where u is constant.\nThus we may drop the dependence on u, and we obtain the action on N = C \u00d7 R.\nConsider T\u2217, the equilateral triangle in C with vertices at the points 0, 1, and \u2212\u03c9.\nThe map \u0007\u2217(P ) is the rotation by 2\u03c0\/3 about the centre of this triangle, and \u0007\u2217(Q)\nis the rotation by \u03c0 around the midpoint of the side joining 0 to 1. Observe that a\nfundamental domain for \u0007\u2217(\u0002\u221e) = \n(2, 3, 6) acting on C is one-third of T\u2217. Starting\nfrom 0, one can define the vertices of T\u2217 as 0, \u0007\u2217(P )(0) = \u2212\u03c9, and \u0007\u2217(P 2)(0) = 1.\nThis action of \u0007\u2217(P ) and \u0007\u2217(Q) may be lifted to give a geometrical interpretation of\nthe action of P and Q. Specifically, writing z= (3 \u2212 i\u221a3 )\/6 + \u03b6 , we see\nP :\n(1\n2\n\u2212 i\n\u221a\n3\n6\n+ \u03b6, t, u\n)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n(1\n2\n\u2212 i\n\u221a\n3\n6\n+ \u03c9\u03b6, t + 2 Im(\u03b6 ) + 2\u221a\n3\n, u\n)\n.\nHence the action of the parabolic element P is a (Heisenberg) rotation by 2\u03c0\/3 around\nthe vertical line that projects to (3 \u2212 i\u221a3 )\/6, the centre of T\u2217, followed by an upward\nvertical translation by 2\/\n\u221a\n3. From the Euclidean point of view, P also involves a\nshear. Likewise, writing z= 1\/2 + \u03b6 , we see that\nQ :\n(1\n2\n+ \u03b6, t, u\n)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n(1\n2\n\u2212 \u03b6, t + 2 Im(\u03b6 ) +\n\u221a\n3, u\n)\n.\nThus the action of the parabolic element Q is a (Heisenberg) rotation by \u03c0 about the\nvertical line that projects to 1\/2 followed by an upward vertical translation by \u221a3.\nThe map PQ\u22121 is\nPQ\u22121 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f01 0 00 \u2212\u03c9 0\n0 0 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .

In particular,\n(PQ\u22121)6 = 1.\n260 FALBEL and PARKER\np1 = (\u2013w, 0)\np0 = (0, \u2013\u221a3)\np2 = (1, 0)\np3 = (0, \u2013\u221a3)\nFigure 1. The tetrahedron T in the Heisenberg group\nLet T be the affine tetrahedron, shown in Figure 1, in N with vertices at p0 =\n(0,\u2212\u221a3), p1 = P (p0) = (\u2212\u03c9, 0), p2 = P 2(p0) = (1, 0), and p3 = P 3(p0) =\n(0,\u221a3).\nObserve that PQ\u22121 fixes p0, p3 and that p1 = PQ\u22121(p2). Denoting the faces of\nT by the ordered triples of their vertices, this gives the following side-pairing maps\nfor T:\nP : (p0, p1, p2) \n\u2212\u2192 (p1, p2, p3),\nPQ\u22121 : (p0, p2, p3) \n\u2212\u2192 (p0, p1, p3).\nSimilarly, denoting the edges of T by the ordered pairs of their endpoints, the edge\ncycles given by these side-pairings are\n(p0, p3) PQ\n\u22121\n\u2212\u2192 (p0, p3),\n(p0, p1) P\u2212\u2192 (p1, p2) P\u2212\u2192 (p2, p3) PQ\n\u22121\n\u2212\u2192 (p1, p3) P\n\u22121\u2212\u2192 (p0, p2) PQ\n\u22121\n\u2212\u2192 (p0, p1).\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 261\nT\nP3(T)\nP2(T)\nP(T)\np0 p0\np1 p2\np3 p3 p3\np1 p2 p1 p2\np0\nFigure 2. Tessellating the Heisenberg group with T\nThis has used all the edges of T. The first of these cycles gives the relation (PQ\u22121)6 =\n1, and the second gives the relation Q\u22122P 3 = 1. These relations follow from equations\n(9) and (10).\nWe now show that the images of T under \u0002\u221e tessellate N (see Fig. 2).\nLEMMA 3.3\nThe images of T under \u3008P \u3009 are disjoint except for common faces and fill the\nprism whose vertical projection under \u0007 is T\u2217, the equilateral triangle with vertices\n0, 1, \u2212\u03c9.\nProof\nIt is clear that the vertical sides of T, namely, (p0, p1, p3) and (p0, p2, p3), are\ncontained in the vertical sides of the prism. Moreover, P (T) is an affine tetrahedron\nwith vertices p1, p2, p3, and p4 = P (p3) = (\u2212\u03c9, 2\n\u221a\n3). The vertical sides of this\ntetrahedron are contained in the vertical sides of the prism. The two tetrahedra T and\nP (T) share a common face (p1, p2, p3). Otherwise, they are disjoint. A similar result\nholds for P 2(T), which shares a face with P (T). The three tetrahedra T, P (T), and\nP 2(T) together form a finite piece of the prism with parallel top and bottom faces\n(p0, p1, p2) and P 3(p0, p1, p2). Since P 3 is a vertical translation, the result follows\nimmediately. \u0001\n262 FALBEL and PARKER\nPROPOSITION 3.4\nThe images of T under \u0002\u221e tessellate N. Moreover, \u0002\u221e has the presentation\n\u0002\u221e = \u3008P, Q | (PQ\u22121)6 = 1, P 3 = Q2\u3009.\nProof\nLet T\u2217 be the equilateral triangle with vertices 0, 1, and \u2212\u03c9 in C. The complex plane\nis tessellated by images of this equilateral triangle, each of which consists of three\ncopies of a fundamental domain for \n(2, 3, 6) = \u0007\u2217(\u0002\u221e). The preimage of T\u2217 under\n\u0007 is tessellated by images of T. Applying an appropriate word in \u0002\u221e, we see that the\npreimages under \u0007 of each of the other equilateral triangles are also tessellated by\nimages of T. Hence the images of T under \u0002\u221e cover N.\nIt remains to check which words in \u0002\u221e give rise to the same tetrahedron. Suppose\nthat A and B are two such words. Then the words \u0007\u2217(A) and \u0007\u2217(B) give the same\nelement of \n(2, 3, 6). In other words, \u0007\u2217(AB\u22121) is in the normal closure of the group\ngenerated by \u0007\u2217(P 3), \u0007\u2217(Q2), \u0007\u2217((PQ\u22121)6). Because ker(\u0007\u2217) = \u3008P 3\u3009 is central, we\nsee that AB\u22121 is the corresponding word in the normal closure of P 3, Q2, (PQ\u22121)6\ntimes a power of P 3. Since P 3 = Q2 and (PQ\u22121)6 = 1, we see that AB\u22121 is a power\nof P 3. (We have again used the fact that P 3 is central.) Since A and B gave rise to\nthe same tetrahedron and since P 3 is a translation, we see that AB\u22121 = 1. Hence the\nimages of T under \u0002\u221e have disjoint interiors, and so they tessellate N. \u0001\n3.2. Generators for PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9])\nAs in Section 2.3, let R be given by\nR =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f00 0 10 \u22121 0\n1 0 0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb . (11)\nRecall that R has isometric sphere S0 given by (5), which we equip with geographical\ncoordinates. Observe that R maps S0 to itself, sending the point with coordinates\n(r, \u03b8, \u03b1) to the point with coordinates (r,\u2212\u03b8, \u03b1), fixing the slice of S0 corresponding\nto \u03b8 = 0. Moreover, R swaps the inside and the outside of S0. Similarly, PQ\u22121\nmaps S0 to itself and sends the point (r, \u03b8, \u03b1) to (r, \u03b8, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c0\/3), fixing the spine of\nS0.\nWe now show that adjoining R to \u0002\u221e gives the full Eisenstein-Picard modular\ngroup.\nTHEOREM 3.5\nThe Eisenstein-Picard modular group PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]) is generated by P , Q, and R.\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 263\nProof\nWe first show that \u3008P, Q, R\u3009 has only one cusp. (The fact that PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]) has\nonly one cusp is already known; see [H2, page 30].) Our fundamental domain for\n\u0002\u221e = \u3008P,Q\u3009 is an affine simplex T whose vertices all lie inside the Heisenberg\nsphere ||z|2 + it | = 2. Since this Heisenberg sphere is convex, the whole of T lies\ninside the sphere. There is a fundamental domain for \u3008P, Q, R\u3009 lying outside the\nisometric sphere of R and inside the fundamental domain (in H2\nC\n) for \u3008P,Q\u3009. This\nintersection meets \u2202H2\nC\nonly in q\u221e. Hence \u3008P, Q, R\u3009 has only one cusp.\nClearly, the group generated by P , Q, R is a subgroup of PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]). As\nboth groups have cofinite volume, \u3008P, Q, R\u3009 must have finite index, say, d, in \u0002 =\nPU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]). Hence the stabiliser of q\u221e in \u3008P, Q, R\u3009 must have index d in \u0002\u221e as\nwell.

A fundamental domain for PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9])\nWe now construct a fundamental domain of PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]). A priori, there is no reason\nto expect that the fundamental domain is the intersection of the outside of the isometric\nsphere S0 of R with the fundamental domain we have already constructed for \u0002\u221e.\nIndeed, this is not the case.\nFor example, consider the map P 2Q\u22121RP and, for small \u03b4, the point\nz\u03b4 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 \u22121 \u2212 \u03b41 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 i\u03c9\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nThen, after scaling so that its last coordinate is 1, the point P 2Q\u22121RP (z\u03b4) is\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 \u03c9 \u22121 1\u2212\u03c9 1 \u2212 \u03c9 \u03c9\n1 1 \u03c9\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 \u22121 \u2212 \u03b41 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 i\u03c9\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb \u2248\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 \u22121 + i\u03b41 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 i\u03c9 + \u03b4 + i\u03c9\u03b4\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb+ O(\u03b42).\n(O(\u03b42) denotes a vector in C3 whose entries have absolute values bounded by a constant\nmultiple of \u03b42 for small \u03b4.) For sufficiently small \u03b4, both z\u03b4 and P 2Q\u22121RP (z\u03b4) lie\noutside S0 and inside the fundamental domain we constructed for \u0002\u221e.\nIn fact, we show that by making suitable modifications to the fundamental domain\nof \u0002\u221e, it is possible to produce a fundamental domain for \u0002 that is the intersection\nof a fundamental domain for \u0002\u221e with the outside of S0. If this is the case, then it is\nclearly necessary that the points of S0 in the boundary of our fundamental domain lie\noutside every other isometric sphere.\nThe modifications consist of introducing totally geodesic skeletons whenever\npossible. The vertices of the fundamental domain are the same as those for the in-\ntersection of S0 (the isometric sphere of R) with the fundamental domain we have\nalready constructed for \u0002\u221e. The edges are geodesics joining the vertices (the point q\u221e\nis an ideal vertex). The 2-faces are totally geodesic whenever possible. In our case, as\nall 2-faces are triangles, they are totally geodesic if and only if their three vertices are\ncontained in a totally geodesic subspace. The triangles containing the ideal vertex are\nfoliated by geodesics starting at the ideal vertex and arriving at the opposite edge.\nTo determine the remaining 2-faces and 3-faces, we observe that the finite edges\n(those not containing the ideal vertex) are all contained in the isometric sphere S0.\nTwo of the 2-faces are meridians of S0, and the two remaining 2-faces are defined as\nintersections of S0 with appropriate images of themselves by elements of \u0002\u221e. In this\nway, we guarantee the pairing between the faces.\nOne of the 3-faces (the finite one) is contained in S0. The other four 3-faces are\ncones based at the 2-faces of that 3-face with the cone point the ideal vertex.\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 265\nTo this end, we begin by investigating the intersection of S0 with its neighbouring\nisometric spheres.\n4.1. The intersection of S0 and its neighbours\nWe have already considered the points pn \u2208 N for n = 0, . . . , 3. Consider the geodesic\n\u03b3n through pn with one end q\u221e, and let zn be the intersection of \u03b3n with S0. Then\nz0 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u03c90\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z1 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u22121\u2212\u03c9\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z2 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u221211\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , z3 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u03c90\n1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb .\nIn horospherical coordinates, these fixed points are given by\nz0 = (0,\u2212\n\u221a\n3, 1), z1 = (\u2212\u03c9, 0, 1), z2 = (1, 0, 1), z3 = (0,\n\u221a\n3, 1).\nWe see that these points all lie in the horosphere H1. Making the canonical identifi-\ncation between H1 and N identifies zn with pn for n = 0, 1, 2, 3. Instead of joining\nthese vertices with affine subspaces to form the simplex T in N as we did before, we\nnow join them with subspaces reflecting the geometry of complex hyperbolic space\nto obtain a simplex T0 contained in S0.\nIn terms of the geographical coordinates on S0, these points are given by the\nfollowing.\n\u0001 The point z0 has r = 0, so it lies on the spine of S0 and on the slice of S0 with\n\u03b8 = \u03c0\/3.\n\u0001 The point z1 has r = 1 and lies on the slice of S0 with \u03b8 = 0 and the meridian\nwith \u03b1 = \u2212\u03c0\/3.\n\u0001 The point z2 has r = 1 and lies on the slice of S0 with \u03b8 = 0 and the meridian\nwith \u03b1 = 0.\n\u0001 The point z3 has r = 0, so it lies on the spine of S0 and on the slice of S0 with\n\u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0\/3.\nWe observe that since pn = Pn(p0) for n = 0, . . . , 3 and since the points zn\nall lie on a horosphere, we immediately have zn = Pn(z0). Alternatively, we could\nhave verified this directly. This means that P\u2212m(zn) = zn\u2212m lies on P\u2212m(S0) for each\nn \u2212 3 \u2264 m \u2264 n. This immediately gives the following lemma.\nLEMMA 4.1\nWe have\nz0 \u2208 S0 \u2229 P\u22121(S0) \u2229 P\u22122(S0) \u2229 P\u22123(S0), z1 \u2208 P (S0) \u2229 S0 \u2229 P\u22121(S0) \u2229 P\u22122(S0),\nz2 \u2208 P 2(S0) \u2229 P (S0) \u2229 S0 \u2229 P\u22121(S0), z3 \u2208 P 3(S0) \u2229 P 2(S0) \u2229 P (S0) \u2229 S0.\n266 FALBEL and PARKER\nFor each pair of distinct m, n \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}, let \u03b3mn = \u03b3nm be the geodesic arc joining\nzn and zm.\nLEMMA 4.2\nWe have\n\u03b301 \u2282 S0 \u2229 P\u22121(S0) \u2229 P\u22122(S0), \u03b312 \u2282 P (S0) \u2229 S0 \u2229 P\u22121(S0),\n\u03b323 \u2282 P 2(S0) \u2229 P (S0) \u2229 S0, \u03b302 \u2282 S0 \u2229 P\u22121(S0),\n\u03b313 \u2282 P (S0) \u2229 S0, \u03b303 in the spine of S0.\nProof\nAs z0 and z3 lie on the spine of S0, then, by definition, so does the geodesic arc joining\nthem. Hence z0 and z3 must lie on every meridian.\nThe points z0, z3, and z1 all lie on the meridian of S0 with \u03b1 = \u2212\u03c0\/3. Since\nmeridians are totally geodesic, this implies that \u03b301 and \u03b313 both lie on this meridian.\nApplying P , we see that z1 = P (z0) and z2 = P (z1) lie on a meridian of P (S0). Hence\n\u03b312 lies on this meridian. Similarly, \u03b323 lies on a meridian of P 2(S0). Applying P\u22121,\nwe see that z0 = P\u22121(z1) and z2 = P\u22121(z3) lie on the same meridian of P\u22121(S0).\nHence \u03b302 lies on this meridian.\nLikewise, \u03b302 and \u03b323 lie on the meridian of S0 with \u03b1 = 0. Applying powers of\nP , we see that \u03b313 lies on a meridian of P (S0), \u03b312 lies on a meridian of P\u22121(S0), and\n\u03b301 lies on a meridian of P\u22122(S0).\nObserve that z1 and z2 lie on the slice of S0 with \u03b8 = 0. Since slices are totally\ngeodesic, we see that \u03b312 lies on this slice. Applying P , we see that \u03b323 lies on a slice\nof P (S0); likewise, \u03b301 lies on a slice of P\u22121(S0).\nPutting all this together gives the result. \u0001\nWe now investigate the intersection of S0 and S\u22121 = P\u22121(S0) a little more closely. A\nbrief computation shows that S\u22121 is given by\nS\u22121 =\n{(z, t, u) \u2208 H2\nC\n:\n\u2223\u2223|z|2 + u \u2212 it \u2212 2z \u2212 2\u03c9\u2223\u2223 = 2 }. (12)\nLEMMA 4.3\nA point (r, \u03b8, \u03b1) of S0 written in geographical coordinates with \u2212\u03c0\/3 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0 does\nnot intersect the interior of S\u22121, provided that\nr \u2264 2 cos\n(\u03b8\n2\n+ \u03c0\n6\n)\ncos\n(\n\u03b1 + \u03c0\n6\n)\n\u2212\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 4 cos2\n(\u03b8\n2\n+ \u03c0\n6\n)\nsin2\n(\n\u03b1 + \u03c0\n6\n)\nwith equality if and only if the point lies in S0 \u2229 S\u22121.\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 267\nProof\nChanging to geographical coordinates in (12), we see that a point of S0 does not\nintersect the interior of S\u22121 if and only if\n1 \u2264 |ei\u03b8 \u2212 rei(\u03b1+\u03b8\/2) + e\u2212i\u03c0\/3| =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223rei(\u03b1+\u03c0\/6) \u2212 2 cos (\u03b82 + \u03c06\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223 (13)\nwith equality if and only if the point lies on S0 \u2229 S\u22121.

In order to see this, observe\nthat \u2212\u03c0\/3 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0 implies 2 cos(\u03b1 + \u03c0\/6) \u2265 \u221a3 and 4 sin2(\u03b1 + \u03c0\/6) \u2264 1.

We know that \u03b1 =\n\u2212\u03c0\/3 for each point of \u03b301. Substituting into Lemma 4.3 and requiring equality gives\nr =\n\u221a\n3 cos\n(\u03b8\n2\n+ \u03c0\n6\n)\n\u2212\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 cos2\n(\u03b8\n2\n+ \u03c0\n6\n)\n= 2 cos\n(\u03b8\n2\n+ \u03c0\n3\n)\n.\nWe know that \u03b8 = \u03c0\/3 at z0 and \u03b8 = 0 at z1. This gives the first part.\nThe coordinates for \u03b302 follow similarly, using \u03b1 = 0.\nThe geodesic arc \u03b312 lies in the slice of S0 given by \u03b8 = 0. We know that\n\u03b1 = \u2212\u03c0\/3 at z1 and \u03b1 = 0 at z0, and so \u2212\u03c0\/3 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0 on \u03b312. Using Lemma 4.3\nand setting \u03b8 = 0 gives\nr =\n\u221a\n3 cos\n(\n\u03b1 + \u03c0\n6\n)\n\u2212\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 3 sin2\n(\n\u03b1 + \u03c0\n6\n)\n.\nRecall that, as in Section 3.2, R acts on S0 by R : (r, \u03b8, \u03b1) \n\u2212\u2192 (r,\u2212\u03b8, \u03b1), and\nso R(z0) = z3 and R fixes z1 and z2. Thus to find \u03b313 and \u03b323, we should replace \u03b8\nwith \u2212\u03b8 in the expressions for \u03b301 and \u03b302, respectively. This gives the result. \u0001\n4.2.

Both points\nhave modulus greater than 2 cos(\u03b8\/2 + \u03c0\/3), and therefore, points of C0 either have\n|rei\u03b1 \u2212 2 cos(\u03b8\/2 + \u03c0\/6)e\u2212i\u03c0\/6| < 1 or r > 2 cos(\u03b8\/2 + \u03c0\/3).

Since T0 is a three-dimensional simplex in the space of geographical coordinates,\nthe result follows. \u0001\nLEMMA 4.11\nThe only elements of \u0002\u221e mapping S0 to itself are powers of PQ\u22121.\nProof\nIf T \u2208 \u0002\u221e maps S0 to itself, then T must fix (0, 0, 0), the centre of S0. Thus T is\ndiagonal. Using the fact that T is in PU(2, 1) and that the entries of T lie in Z[\u03c9], we\nimmediately see that T is a power of PQ\u22121. \u0001\nPROPOSITION 4.12\nThe interior of T0 is disjoint from all images of S0 under \u0002\u221e \u2212 \u3008PQ\u22121\u3009.\nProof\nSuppose that (z, t, u) lies both on T0 and on an isometric sphere of radius\n\u221a\n2 with\ncentre (z0, t0, 0) \u000b= (0, 0, 0). That is,\n(|z|2 + u)2 + t2 = (|z \u2212 z0|2 + u)2 +\n(\nt \u2212 t0 + 2 Im (zz0)\n)2 = 4,\nor, using geographical coordinates,\n1 =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223ei\u03b8 \u2212 rei(\u03b8\/2+\u03b1)z0 + (|z0|2 + it0)2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223.\nMoreover, z0 and (|z0|2 + it0)\/2 must both lie in Z[\u03c9].\nSince (|z|2 + u)2 + t2 = 4 and u \u2265 1 (from Lemma 4.8), we have |z| \u2264 1 and\n|z|4 + t2 \u2264 3 \u2212 2|z|2. Similarly, |z \u2212 z0| \u2264 1 and |z \u2212 z0|4 +\n(\nt \u2212 t0 + 2 Im(zz0)\n)2 \u2264\n3 \u2212 2|z \u2212 z0|2.

Thus we need to\ninvestigate the intersection of S0 with isometric spheres centred at (z0, t0, 0), where\nz0 and (|z0|2 \u2212 it0)\/2 are both in Z[\u03c9] and ||z0|2 \u2212 it0| \u2264 4. This immediately implies\nthat ||z0|2 \u2212 it0| equals 2, 2\n\u221a\n3, or 4.\n274 FALBEL and PARKER\nFirst, suppose that ||z0|2 \u2212 it0| = 2. Therefore, (|z0|2 \u2212 it0)\/2 is a power of \u2212\u03c9.\nThis implies that z0 = (\u2212\u03c9)k for k = 0, . . . , 5 and t0 = +\u2212\n\u221a\n3. Suppose that (r, \u03b8, \u03b1)\nlies on both S0 and the image of S0 with centre z0 = (\u2212\u03c9)k , t0 = +\u2212\n\u221a\n3. Then\n1 = |ei\u03b8 + e+\u2212i\u03c0\/3 \u2212 rei(\u03b1+\u03b8\/2+\u03c0k\/3)| =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223rei\u03b1 \u2212 2 cos (\u03b82 \u2213 \u03c06\n)\ne\u2212i(\u03c0k\/3\u2213\u03c0\/6)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223.\nIf (r, \u03b8, \u03b1) \u2208 T0, then we must have\n1 \u2264\n\u2223\u2223\u2223rei\u03b1 \u2212 2 cos (\u03b82 +\u2212 \u03c06\n)\ne\u2212i\u03c0\/6\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nfor both choices of sign. Combining these, we see that rei\u03b1 is at least as close\n(with respect to the Euclidean metric on C) to 2 cos(\u03b8\/2 \u2213 \u03c0\/6)e\u2212i(\u03c0k\/3\u2213i\u03c0\/6) as to\n2 cos(\u03b8\/2 \u2213 \u03c0\/6)e\u2212i\u03c0\/6. Since \u2212\u03c0\/3 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0, we must have k = 1\/2 +\u2212 1\/2, and so\n(z0, t0, 0) = (1,\u2212\n\u221a\n3, 0) = P\u22121(0, 0, 0) or (\u2212\u03c9,\u221a3, 0) = P (0, 0, 0). Hence (r, \u03b8, \u03b1)\nlies on F3 or F4. In particular, it does not lie in the interior of T0.\nSecond, suppose that ||z0|2 \u2212 it0| = 2\n\u221a\n3. Then either |z0| =\n\u221a\n3 and t0 = +\u2212\n\u221a\n3\nor else z0 = 0 and t0 = +\u22122\n\u221a\n3.\nIn the former case, z0 = (1\u2212\u03c9)(\u2212\u03c9)k =\n\u221a\n3e\u2212i(\u03c0\/6+k\u03c0\/3) for some k = 0, . . . , 5.\nUsing Lemmas 4.9 and 4.8, we see that if (z, t, u) lies in T0, then |z \u2212 z0| \u2265 1 and\nu \u2265 1. In the latter case, we only have equality at the vertices. This implies\n(|z \u2212 z0|2 + u)2 \u2265 4\nwith strict inequality except at the vertices. Thus the interiors of the tetrahedra are\ndisjoint.\nIf z0 = 0 and t0 = +\u22122\n\u221a\n3, then we have\n(|z|2 + u)2 + t2 = (|z|2 + u)2 + (t \u2213 2\n\u221a\n3)2 = 4.\nThe only solutions with u \u2265 1 are (0,+\u2212\n\u221a\n3, 1), that is, the points z0 and z3.\nFinally, suppose that ||z0|2 \u2212 it0| = 4. Since z0 and (|z0|2 + it0)\/2 are both\nin Z[\u03c9], the only possibility in this case is |z0| = 2, t0 = 0. However, we know\nthat |z| \u2264 1 and |z \u2212 z0| \u2264 1 with equality only when u = 1. Using the triangle\ninequality, we see that u = 1, and the interior of T0 does not intersect this isometric\nsphere. \u0001\n4.3. The four-dimensional simplex\nWe now define tetrahedra T1, T2, T3, and T4. Each of these is the geodesic cone from\nq\u221e over the union of faces F1, F2, F3, and F4 of T0. To be precise, the tetrahedron T1\nis defined to be the union over all points p of F1 of the geodesic arc joining p to q\u221e,\nand it is likewise for T2, T3, and T4.\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 275\nPROPOSITION 4.13\nThe tetrahedra T1, T2, T3, and T4 are three-dimensional simplices embedded in\nH2\nC\n\u222a {q\u221e}.\nProof\nIt suffices to show that vertical projection \u0007 maps each face of T0 bijectively\nonto its image. Equivalently, given a point on \u2202T0 with horospherical coordinates\n(z, t, u), u is then specified by z and t . Since T0 is contained in S0, we have\nu = \u221a4 \u2212 t2 \u2212 |z|2. \u0001\nBy construction, the intersection of T0 with each of the tetrahedra T1, T2, T3, T4\nis nothing other than the corresponding face of T0. Similarly, each pair of tetrahedra\nfrom T1, T2, T3, and T4 intersects in a two-dimensional subset formed by the geodesic\ncone from q\u221e of the edges \u03b312, . . . , \u03b303. Finally, each triple of T1, T2, T3, and T4\nintersects in the geodesic arc joining the appropriate vertex of T0 with q\u221e.\nWe define the four-dimensional simplex D to be the geodesic cone from q\u221e of\nthe tetrahedron T0. By the same argument given in Proposition 4.13, we see that D\nis an embedded 4-simplex in H2\nC\n\u222a {q\u221e}. Moreover, D has five three-dimensional\nfaces, namely, T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4. The goal of this section is to show that D is a\nfundamental domain for the Eisenstein-Picard modular group.\nPROPOSITION 4.14\nThe interior of the domain D lies outside all isometric spheres of elements of \u0002\u2212\u0002\u221e.\nProof\nLet A \u2208 \u0002 \u2212 \u0002\u221e be written in the form (2). By definition, the radius of the isometric\nsphere of A is\n\u221a\n2\/|g|. Since g \u2208 Z[\u03c9], we see that |g| is 1, \u221a3, or at least 2.\nSuppose that (z, t, u) is on an isometric sphere with centre (z0, t0, 0) and radius\nat most 1 (that is, |g| \u2265 2). Then\u2223\u2223|z \u2212 z0|2 + u \u2212 it + it0 \u2212 2iIm(zz0)\u2223\u2223 \u2264 1.\nIt is clear that u \u2264 1, and so (z, t, u) cannot lie in the interior of T0.\nSecond, suppose that A \u2208 \u0002 \u2212 \u0002\u221e has isometric sphere of radius\n\u221a\n2. That is,\n|g| = 1. Then g = (\u2212\u03c9)k . So as a vector in CP 2,\nA\u22121(\u221e) =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\nj\nh\ng\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb .\n276 FALBEL and PARKER\nWe see that j\/g and h\/g both lie in Z[\u03c9]. That is, A\u22121(\u221e) lies in the \u0002\u221e-orbit\nof R(q\u221e), and so our isometric sphere is the image of S0 under an element of \u0002\u221e.\nSuppose that (z, t, u) lies in the interior of D. Then there exists u1 \u2264 u, so that (z, t, u1)\nlies in the interior of T0. But we know from Proposition 4.12 that T0 lies outside all\n\u0002\u221e-images of S0 other than S0. Since u > u1, we see that (z, t, u) lies outside all\nisometric spheres of radius\n\u221a\n2.\nFinally, suppose that A \u2208 \u0002 \u2212 \u0002\u221e has isometric sphere with radius\n\u221a\n2\/\n\u221a\n3 and\ncentre (z0, t0, 0) (that is, |g| =\n\u221a\n3). Again, we write A\u22121(\u221e) as a vector in CP 2, as\nin the previous equation, and observe that g = i\u221a3(\u2212\u03c9)k for some integer k. As A is\nin PU(2, 1), we have\n0 = jg + |h|2 + gj,\nand so we see that |h|2 is divisible by 3. Thus h \u2208 i\u221a3Z[\u03c9]. In other words, h\/g \u2208\nZ[\u03c9]. Because h and g are both in i\n\u221a\n3 Z[\u03c9] and since |det(A)| = 1, we see that\nj+\u22121 \u2208 i\n\u221a\n3 Z[\u03c9]. Thus j\/g\u2213i\/\u221a3 is in Z[\u03c9]. Hence (|z0|2\u2212 it0+\u22122i\/\n\u221a\n3)\/2 \u2208 Z[\u03c9].\nIn other words, (z0, t0 \u2213 2\/\n\u221a\n3) is in the \u0002\u221e-orbit of R(q\u221e) = (0, 0, 0).\nWe have\n(|z \u2212 z0|2 + u)2 +\n(\nt \u2212 t0 + 2 Im(zz0)\n)2 = 4\n3\n.\nIf u > 1, then\n(\nt \u2212 t0 + 2 Im(zz0)\n)2\n<\n4\n3\n\u2212 1 = 1\n3\n.\nTherefore,\n(|z \u2212 z0|2 + u)2 +\n(\nt \u2212 t0 + 2 Im\n(\nzz0 +\u2212\n2\u221a\n3\n))2\n= (|z \u2212 z0|2 + u)2 +\n(\nt \u2212 t0 + 2 Im(zz0)\n)2 +\u2212 4\u221a3\n(\nt \u2212 t0 + 2 Im(zz0)\n)+ 4\n3\n<\n4\n3\n+ 4\n3\n+ 4\n3\n.\nThus (z, t, u) lies inside the isometric sphere of radius \u221a2 with centre (z0, t0 \u22132\/\n\u221a\n3),\nthat is, inside the image of S0 under some element of \u0002\u221e. Using Proposition 4.12, we\nsee that (z, t, u) is not in T0. \u0001\nTHEOREM 4.15\nThe simplex D is a fundamental domain for PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]).\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 277\nProof\nThe proof follows the standard proof for the standard fundamental domain of PSL(2,Z)\n(see, e.g., [L, pages 57 \u2013 60]).\nFirst, we show that every orbit has a point inside D. Let (z, t, u) be any point in H2\nC\n.\nBy applying elements of \u0002\u221e, we may assume that (z, t, u) lies inside the fundamental\ndomain for \u0002\u221e obtained by extending the vertical geodesic arcs in D to \u2202H2C\u2212{q\u221e}. If\n(z, t, u) also lies outside or on S0, then it is already in D. Otherwise, (z, t, u) lies inside\nS0, and applying R gives a point in the orbit of (z, t, u) whose horospherical height is\nstrictly greater than u. We iterate this procedure. Using the proper discontinuity of the\naction of PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]), we see that this process terminates after finitely many steps.\nThe final point is in the orbit of (z, t, u), lies in a fundamental domain for \u0002\u221e, and\nhas horospherical height maximal among all points in the orbit of (z, t, u). It must,\ntherefore, lie outside or on S0 and so be in D.\nWe now show that if two points in D differ by an element of A of PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]),\nthen they must lie in \u2202D and be identified by a side-pairing map. By construction, all\npoints of \u2202D are the image of a point of \u2202D under a side-pairing map.\nSuppose that (z, t, u) lies in the interior of D. Since D lies in a fundamental domain\nfor \u0002\u221e, all images of (z, t, u) under nontrivial elements of \u0002\u221e lie outside D. From\nProposition 4.14, we see that (z, t, u) lies outside all isometric spheres of elements of\n\u0002 \u2212 \u0002\u221e.\nNow consider A(z, t, u) = (z\u2032, t \u2032, u\u2032), where A \u2208 \u0002 \u2212\u0002\u221e. We know that A maps\nthe exterior of the isometric sphere of A to the interior of the isometric sphere of A\u22121.\nHence we see that A(z, t, u) cannot lie in the interior of D. This gives the result. \u0001\n5. Poincare\u00b4 polyhedra\nIn this section, we review Poincare\u00b4\u2019s polyhedron theorem. Since we already know\nboth that the Eisenstein-Picard modular group is discrete and that D is a fundamental\ndomain, we do not need the full strength of Poincare\u00b4\u2019s theorem. In fact, we use it only\nto establish the connection between the geometry of the action of \u0002 and the algebra of\na presentation for \u0002. Specifically, the generators of \u0002 are the side-pairing maps, and\nthe relations are generated by reflection and cycle relations. However, direct use of\nPoincare\u00b4\u2019s theorem yields another proof that \u0002 is discrete with fundamental domain D.\nWe follow the general formulation of Poincare\u00b4\u2019s polyhedron theorem given in Mostow\n[M], and we refer to that article for details of the proof. An excellent account of\nPoincare\u00b4\u2019s theorem in the case of constant curvature is given in [EP] by Epstein and\nPetronio.\n5.1. Poincare\u00b4\u2019s polyhedron theorem\nA polyhedron is a combinatorial object specified by its vertices, edges, and other\nfaces of higher dimension. We assume that it is a cellular complex homeomorphic to\n278 FALBEL and PARKER\na polytope, possibly with an infinite number of faces. In particular, there exists only\none cell of highest-dimension n, and the interior of each cell of codimension two is\ncontained in precisely two codimension-one cells. Its realisation as a cell complex in a\nmanifold X is also referred to as a polyhedron. Let D be the (closed) polyhedron, and\nlet Ek(D) denote the codimension k faces of the polyhedron D. We say a polyhedron\nis smooth if its faces are smooth.\nDefinition 5.1\nA Poincare\u00b4 polyhedron is a smooth polyhedron in X with codimension-one faces Ti\nsuch that we have following.\n\u0001 The codimension-one faces are paired by a set \n of homeomorphisms Aij :\nTi \u2212\u2192 Tj of X called the side-pairing transformations, which respect the cell\nstructure. We assume that if Aij \u2208 \n, then A\u22121ij = Aji \u2208 \n.\n\u0001 For every Aij \u2208 \n such that Ti = Aij (Tj ), then Aij (D) \u2229 D = Ti .\nRemark. If Ti = Tj (that is, a side-pairing maps one side to itself), then we impose\nthe restriction that Aii : Ti \u2212\u2192 Ti is of order two, and we call it a reflection. In this\ncase, the relation Aii2 = 1 is called a reflection relation.\nLet T1 \u2208 E1(D) be a codimension-one face, and let F1 \u2208 E2(D) be a codimension-two\nface contained in T1. Let T \u20321 be the other codimension-one face containing F1. Let\nT2 be the codimension-one face paired to T \u20321 by A1 \u2208 \n and F2 = A1(F1). Again,\nthere exists only one other codimension-one face containing F2, which we call T \u20322. We\ndefine recursively Ai and Fi , so that Ai\u22121 \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 A1(F1) = Fi .\nDefinition 5.2 (Cyclic)\nCyclic is the condition that for each pair (F1, T1) (a codimension-two face contained\nin a codimension-one face), there exists r \u2265 1 such that, in the construction in the\nprevious paragraph, Ar \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 A1(T1) = T1 and Ar \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 A1 restricted to F1 is the\nidentity. Moreover, writing A = Ar \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 A1, there exists a positive integer m such\nthat Am = 1 and\nA1\n\u22121(D) \u222a (A2 \u25e6 A1)\u22121(D) \u222a (A3 \u25e6 A2 \u25e6 A1)\u22121(D) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a A\u22121(D) \u222a (A1 \u25e6 A)\u22121(D)\n\u222a (A2 \u25e6 A1 \u25e6 A)\u22121(D) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (Ar\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 A1 \u25e6 Am\u22121)\u22121(D) \u222a (Am)\u22121(D)\nis a cover of a closed neighbourhood of the interior of F1 by polyhedra with disjoint\ninteriors.\nThe relation Am = (Ar \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 A1)m = 1 is called a cycle relation.\nIn order to prove Poincare\u00b4\u2019s theorem, we need a more general version of tiling,\nwhich allows, a priori, for ramifications.\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 279\nDefinition 5.3 (Abutted family [M, Section 6.1, page 198])\nAn abutted family in a topological manifold X is a family of polyhedra D together\nwith the set of adjacency N \u2282 D \u00d7 D such that\n\u0001 if (D,D\u2032) \u2208 N, then D \u000b= D\u2032 and (D\u2032,D) \u2208 N;\n\u0001 if (D,D\u2032) \u2208 N, then D \u2229 D\u2032 \u2208 E1(D) \u2229 E1(D\u2032);\n\u0001 if (D,D\u2032), (D,D\u2032\u2032) \u2208 N and D \u2229 D\u2032 = D \u2229 D\u2032\u2032, then D\u2032 = D\u2032\u2032;\n\u0001 for each T \u2208 E1(D), there exists D\u2032 with D \u2229 D\u2032 = e.\nDefinition 5.4\nThe joined D-space is the quotient topological space of the subspace of X \u00d7 D,\nY\u02dc =\n\u22c3\nD\u2208D\nD \u00d7 {D},\nby the equivalence relation\n(x,D) \u2261 (x \u2032,D\u2032) if and only if x = x \u2032, x \u2208 E1(D) \u2229 E1(D\u2032).\nLet Y denote the joined D-space. The projection\n\u03c0 : Y \u2192 X\nis continuous. In general, Y may not be a manifold, and even if it is a manifold, \u03c0\nmay be branched. The following definition allows us to use induction arguments by\nintersecting abutted families with spheres.\nDefinition 5.5\nA smooth abutted family is an abutted family such that for each codimension k face\ne \u2208 Ek(D) and x \u2208 e, there exists a tubular neighbourhood of the form Bk \u00d7 Bn\u2212k ,\nwhere Bn\u2212k \u2282 e is a neighbourhood in e. For each y \u2208 Bn\u2212k , Bk \u00d7 y is transversal to\ne such that for Sk \u00d7 y, where Sk = \u2202Bk , the family D induces (by intersections) an\nabutted family De which is combinatorially independent of y \u2208 Bn\u2212k .\nWe need the following simple result, which we call the uniformity condition.\nLEMMA 5.6\nIf \u03c0 : Y \u2192 X (X complete, connected) is a local isometry and there exists r > 0 such\nthat for every y \u2208 Y there exists a neighbourhood homeomorphic under \u03c0 to a ball of\nradius r in X, then \u03c0 is a covering.\nObserve that the hypotheses imply that Y is complete.\n280 FALBEL and PARKER\nTHEOREM 5.7\nLet D be a Poincare\u00b4 polyhedron with side-pairing transformations \n \u2282 Isom(X) in\na simply connected Riemannian manifold X satisfying the cyclic condition. Let \u0002 be\nthe group generated by \n. Then D = \u0002D is a smooth abutted family with adjacency\ndefined by the side-pairings. If there exists a positive number r such that every point\nin the joined space Y has a neighbourhood homeomorphic under \u03c0 to a ball of radius\nr , then \u0002 is a discrete subgroup of Isom(X) and D is a fundamental domain. A\npresentation is given by\n\u0002 = \u3008\n | reflection relations, cycle relations\u3009.\nRemark\n\u0001 One first observes that the side-pairings of a Poincare\u00b4 polyhedron generate a\nsmooth abutted family. The adjacency is given by N = {(\u03b3D, \u03b3 \u03b4D) | \u03b3 \u2208\n\u0002 , \u03b4 \u2208 \n}. That follows from the smoothness of the polyhedron and the\nfact that the cycles are finite. The main point is then to prove that the map\n\u03c0 : Y \u2192 X is a homeomorphism. That is where the cyclic condition and the\nuniformity condition, Lemma 5.6, are used.\n\u0001 If D is compact, the uniformity condition for the joined space is automatic\nwhen the cyclic condition is verified.\n\u0001 The typical noncompact Poincare\u00b4 polyhedron that we are interested in is the\nsituation where X is the complex hyperbolic space and D has a cusp. The\nuniformity condition, Lemma 5.6, has to be verified in this case. One has to\nprove that the joined space around that cusp contains (the inverse image by\n\u03c0 of) a horoball. That amounts to covering a whole horoball by carefully\nchosen translates of the polyhedron D (see [EP, Figure 12] for an example not\nsatisfying the condition).\nProof (Sketch; see [M], [EP] for more details)\nWe prove Theorem 5.7 by induction on the dimension. In dimension two, that is the\nclassical Poincare\u00b4 polyhedron theorem. Suppose that the result is true in dimensions\nless than n. We want to show first that Y is a manifold. Faces of codimensions one\nand two are glued nicely by hypothesis. Let e \u2208 Ek(D) for k > 2. Consider a\nsmall neighbourhood of a point x \u2208 e of the form Bk \u00d7 Bn\u2212k , where Bn\u2212k \u2282 e is\na neighbourhood of x in e and where, for each y \u2208 Bn\u2212k , Bk \u00d7 y is transversal to\ne. Using the side-pairings, we obtain tubular neighbourhoods around each point in\nthe equivalence class of x. At each Sk = \u2202Bk , we thus obtain an abutted family. By\ninduction, we prove that the family is a tiling of Sk , and by smoothness, we prove that\nthe tiling is the same for each Sk . Therefore, Y is a manifold.\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 281\nThe map \u03c0 : Y \u2192 X is a local isometry. In order to prove that it is a home-\nomorphism, it suffices to prove that it is a covering map. But that follows from the\nhypothesis of uniformity. \u0001\n5.2. A presentation for \u0002\nIn this section, we use Poincare\u00b4\u2019s theorem on D to give a presentation for \u0002. We begin\nby showing that the generators of \u0002 are side-pairing maps for D.\nPROPOSITION 5.8\nThe following maps are side-pairings of the simplex D:\nR : T0 \u2212\u2192 T0,\nPQ\u22121 : T1 \u2212\u2192 T2,\nP : T3 \u2212\u2192 T4.\nProof\nWe have already verified that R is a side-pairing map. As PQ\u22121 and P are complex\nhyperbolic isometries fixing q\u221e, it suffices to show that PQ\u22121 maps F1 to F2 and that\nP maps F3 to F4. This follows from Proposition 4.6. \u0001\nTHEOREM 5.9\nThe simplex D is a fundamental domain for the group generated by R, PQ\u22121, and P .\nMoreover, a presentation for this group is given by\n\u3008P, Q, R | R2 = (QP\u22121)6 = PQ\u22121RQP\u22121R = P 3Q\u22122 = (RP )3 = 1\u3009.\nSince we have already shown that PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]) is generated by P , Q, and R, Theo-\nrem 5.9 gives both an alternative proof that D is a fundamental domain and also a pre-\nsentation for the Eisenstein-Picard modular group PU(2, 1; Z[\u03c9]). Other presentations\nare given in [A] and [H3].\nProof\nBy the argument of Theorem 3.5, the intersection of the exterior of S0 with a funda-\nmental domain for \u0002\u221e = \u3008P, Q\u3009 contains a fundamental domain for \u3008P, Q, R\u3009 = \u0002.\nLet \u02c6D be the subset of H2\nC\ncomprising (complete) geodesics with one endpoint q\u221e and\npassing through D. (Thus \u02c6D is obtained from D by extending the geodesic segments\nused to define D to meet the boundary.) Then it is clear from Section 3.1 that \u02c6D is a\nfundamental domain for \u0002\u221e. Intersecting \u02c6D with the exterior of S0 just gives us D.\nFor each two-dimensional face F of D, we find the face cycle given by the\nside-pairing maps.\n282 FALBEL and PARKER\nThe faces with one vertex q\u221e are sent to other faces with vertex at q\u221e by maps\nin \u3008P,Q\u3009 = \u0002\u221e. Since the simplex D and its faces containing q\u221e are cones over T0\nand its edges, the edge cycles are the same as those for T0 obtained in Section 3.1.\nBy construction, any horoball not intersecting S0 is covered by the images of D under\n\u0002\u221e. The face cycles from faces containing q\u221e are the same as the edge cycles from\nT0, namely,\n(PQ\u22121)6 = 1 and P 3 = Q2.\nSimilarly, the (one-dimensional) edges of D having one vertex at q\u221e each have a\nneighbourhood covered by images of D.\nNow consider the face F1 with vertices the ordered triple (z2, z0, z3). The face\ncycle is\n(z2, z0, z3) PQ\n\u22121\n\u2212\u2192 (z1, z0, z3) R\u2212\u2192 (z1, z3, z0) (PQ\n\u22121)\u22121\u2212\u2192 (z2, z3, z0) R\u2212\u2192 (z2, z0, z3).\nTherefore, R(PQ\u22121)\u22121RPQ\u22121 is the identity on F1. In fact, R(PQ\u22121)\u22121RPQ\u22121\nis the identity in \u0002, as we may easily verify. We must show that D, (PQ\u22121)\u22121(D),\n(PQ\u22121)\u22121R(D) = R(PQ\u22121)\u22121(D), and (PQ\u22121)\u22121RPQ\u22121(D) = R(D) cover a neigh-\nbourhood of F1. This also shows that a neighbourhood of PQ\u22121(F1) = F2.\nThe map PQ\u22121 maps S0 to itself. (It is just a rotation of S0 about its spine.)\nTherefore, (PQ\u22121)\u22121(T0) is also contained in S0. The image of D under (PQ\u22121)\u22121\nis the geodesic cone of (PQ\u22121)\u22121(T0). Hence D \u222a (PQ\u22121)\u22121(D) covers that part of\na neighbourhood of T\u03b1 exterior to S0. Applying R, we see that D \u222a (PQ\u22121)\u22121(D) \u222a\nR(D) \u222a R(PQ\u22121)\u22121(D) covers a neighbourhood of F1, as claimed.\nNext, consider the face F3 with vertices the ordered triple (z2, z0, z1). The face\ncycle on this face is\n(z2, z0, z1) P\u2212\u2192 (z3, z1, z2) R\u2212\u2192 (z0, z1, z2).\nTherefore, RP maps F3 to itself but with a rotation of order 3. Hence (RP )3 is the\nidentity on F3. In fact, (RP )3 is the identity. We must show that D, P\u22121(D), P\u22121R(D),\nP\u22121RP\u22121(D), P\u22121RP\u22121R(D) = RP (D), and P\u22121RP\u22121RP\u22121(D) = R(D) cover a\nneighbourhood of F3. This also shows that a neighbourhood of P (F3) = F4.\nIn order to see this, first observe that the image of S0 under P\u22121 is S\u22121; therefore,\nD \u222a P\u22121(D) covers a neighbourhood of F3 exterior to both S0 and S\u22121. Now S0 and\nS\u22121 are the isometric spheres of P\u22121R and (P\u22121R)\u22121 = RP . Therefore, the common\nexterior of S0 and S\u22121 form a fundamental domain (the Ford domain) for the group\n\u3008P\u22121R\u3009 with three elements. Hence D \u222aP\u22121(D) and its images under P\u22121R and RP\ncover a neighbourhood of F3.\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 283\nBy Poincare\u00b4\u2019s theorem, we conclude that the 4-simplex is a fundamental domain,\nand the presentation is obtained by the reflection and cycle relations. \u0001\nObserve that \u03d2 = \u3008P, R\u3009 \u2208 PU(2, 1,Z[\u03c9]) is a representation of the triangle group\nof type (2, 3,\u221e) = PSL(2,Z) (the modular group). P is parabolic, R has order 2, and\nRP has order 3. But observe that this representation is not faithful. For example, RP 3\nhas order 6. We see that PU(2, 1,Z[\u03c9]) = \u3008\u03d2, PQ\u22121\u3009, where (PQ\u22121)6 = 1. We can\nalso view PU(2, 1,Z[\u03c9]) = \u3008\u03d2, T \u3009 with relations\n[T ,R] = T 6 = PT \u22121P\u22121T P = 1\nby setting T = PQ\u22121. Thus PU(2, 1,Z[\u03c9]) is obtained by adjoining to \u03d2 one el-\nliptic element of order 6 commuting with R. To summarise, we have the following\nproposition.\nPROPOSITION 5.10\nThe group PU(2, 1,Z[\u03c9]) is obtained from a representation of PSL(2,Z) (discrete but\nnot faithful) in PU(2, 1) by adjoining one elliptic element of order 6.\nObserve that the representation of PSL(2,Z) in PU(2, 1) is contained in the family\nobtained in [FK] and [FP]. It corresponds, in their notation, to the representation\nA(\u221a3\/2).\n5.3. Relation with Mostow\u2019s groups\nIn [M], Mostow constructed a family of groups. Some of his groups are nonarithmetic\nand, in fact, were the first examples of such groups. In his notation, all of Mostow\u2019s\nexamples are generated by three complex reflections, R1, R2, and R3, having orders\n3, 4, or 5. Moreover, these groups have an extra cubic symmetry in the sense that\nthere is a map J of order 3, so that Rk+1 = JRkJ\u22121, where k is defined mod 3. That\nmap J may not be in the group, and in that case, the group generated by the Rk is a\nsubgroup of index three of the group generated by J and R1. Mostow used Dirichlet\ndomains to show that those groups were discrete and to obtain presentations. But the\ncombinatorics of those domains are very complicated.\nWe now show that the Eisenstein-Picard modular group admits a presentation of\na similar type. In fact, we show that it is generated by complex reflections of order\n6 having a cubic symmetry. We begin by showing that \u0002 admits a presentation with\ntwo generators. Our notation reflects that of Mostow. Other sets of generators and\npresentations for the Eisenstein-Picard group are investigated in [A] and [H3]. The\nEisenstein-Picard modular group fits into a family of lattices first investigated by\nLivne\u00b4 [Li]. Similar results about their presentations are given in [P2].\n284 FALBEL and PARKER\nPROPOSITION 5.11\nThe maps J = RP and R1 = QP\u22121 generate \u0002. Moreover, a presentation on these\ngenerators is\n\u3008J, R1 | J 3 = R16 = (JR1\u22121J )4 = R1(JR1\u22121J )2R1\u22121(JR1\u22121J )\u22122 = 1\u3009.\nProof\nWe begin by showing that the relations involving J and R1 follow from the relations\ninvolving P , Q, and R. First, J 3 = (RP )3 = 1 and R16 = (QP\u22121)6 = 1 follow\nimmediately. Also,\n(JR1\u22121J )2 = RPPQ\u22121(RP )2PQ\u22121RP\n= RPPQ\u22121P\u22121R\u22121PQ\u22121RP\n= RP 2Q\u22121P\u22121PQ\u22121R\u22121RP\n= RP 2Q\u22122P\n= R,\nwhere we have used the relations (RP )3 = 1, R\u22121QP\u22121 = QP\u22121R\u22121, and Q2 = P 3\non the second, third, and fifth lines. Thus (JR1\u22121J )4 = R2 = 1 and\nR1(JR1\u22121J )2R1\u22121(JR1\u22121J )\u22122 = (QP\u22121)R(QP\u22121)\u22121R\u22121 = 1.\nUsing R = (JR1\u22121J )2, we obtain\nP = R\u22121J = J\u22121R1JR1 and Q = R1P = R1J\u22121R1JR1.\nHence \u3008P, Q, R\u3009 = \u3008J, R1\u3009.\nFinally, we show that the relations involving P , Q, and R are a consequence\nof those involving J and R1. First, R2 = (JR1\u22121J )4 = 1, (RP )3 = J 3 = 1,\n(QP\u22121)6 = R16 = 1, and\n(QP\u22121)R(QP\u22121)\u22121R\u22121 = R1(JR1\u22121J )2R1\u22121(JR1\u22121J )\u22122 = 1\nfollow immediately. Finally,\nP 3Q\u22122 = (J\u22121R1JR1)3(R1\u22121J\u22121R1\u22121JR1\u22121)2\n= (JR1\u22121J )\u22122R1(JR1\u22121J )2R1\u22121\n= 1.\nThis completes the proof. \u0001\nTHE EISENSTEIN-PICARD MODULAR GROUP 285\nAs in Proposition 5.11, we write R1 = QP\u22121 and J = RP . Define R2 = JR1J\u22121 =\nRPQ\u22121P\u22122R and R3 = J\u22121R1J = P\u22121Q. These are all complex reflections of\norder 6 with a reflection factor \u2212\u03c9 = e2i\u03c0\/6 (see [M, page 174]). We now show that\nR1, R2, and R3 generate \u0002. We also give relations involving the Rk . The form of\nthese relations is motivated by [M, Theorem 20.1]. We make the connection explicit\nin Corollary 5.13.\nPROPOSITION 5.12\nThe maps R1, R2, and R3 generate \u0002. Moreover, a presentation on these generators\nis (with indices taken mod 3)\u2329\nR1, R2, R3\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 Rk6 = 1, RkRk+1Rk = Rk+1RkRk+1, k \u2208 {1, 2, 3},(R1R2R3)4 = 1, (R1R2R3)\u22122R1R2 = (R2R3R1)\u22122R2R3\n\u232a\n.\nProof\nFirst, observe that \u3008R1, R2, R3\u3009 is a subgroup of \u3008J, R1\u3009. Thus we need to show that\nJ is contained in \u3008R1, R2, R3\u3009. We have\nJ = J (JR1\u22121J )4 = (J\u22121R1\u22121J )(JR1\u22121J\u22121)R1\u22121(J\u22121R1\u22121J ) = (R1R2R3)\u22122R1R2.\nWe now show the equivalence of the presentations. We begin by assuming the\nrelations involving R1, R2, and R3 and showing that these imply the relations in-\nvolving J and R1. We already have the fact that R16 = 1. Moreover, the relation\n(R1R2R3)\u22122R1R2 = (R2R3R1)\u22122R2R3 may be written as R3R1R2R3 = R1R2R3R1.\nThus\nJ\u22121 = ((R2R3R1)\u22122R2R3)\u22121\n= R1R2R3R1\n= R1R2R1R1\u22121R3R1\n= R2R1R2R3R1R3\u22121\n= R2R3R1R2.\nThus we have\nJ\u22121 = R1R2R3R1 = R2R3R1R2 = R3R1R2R3.\nHence R2 = JR1J\u22121 and R3 = J\u22121R1J . Also, we have\nJ\u22123 = (R1R2R3R1)(R2R3R1R2)(R3R1R2R3) = (R1R2R3)4 = 1.\nObserve that\n(JR1\u22121J )\u22122 = (R3R1R2R3R1R2R3R1R2)2 = (R3R1R2)6 = (R3R1R2)2.\n286 FALBEL and PARKER\nThus (JR1\u22121J )4 = (R3R1R2)4 = 1 and\nR1(JR1\u22121J )\u22122 = R1R3R1R2R3R1R2\n= R3R1R3R2R3R1R2\n= R3R1R2R3R2R1R2\n= R3R1R2R3R1R2R1\n= (JR1\u22122J )\u22122R1.\nNow we assume the relations involving J and R1. Again, we know Rk6 = 1.\nNext,\nR1R2R1 = J (JR1\u22121J )\u22122R1 = JR1(JR1\u22121J )\u22122 = R2R1R2.\nAs above,\n(R3R1R2)2 = (J\u22121R1JR1JR1J\u22121)2 = (JR1\u22121J )\u22126 = (JR1\u22121J )\u22122,\nand so we have (R3R1R2)4 = 1 and\n(R1R2R3)\u22122R1R2 = R1R2(R3R1R2)\u22122\n= R1JR1J\u22121(JR1\u22121J )2\n= J\n= (JR1\u22121J )2J\u22121R1JR1\n= (R3R1R2)\u22122R3R1. \u0001\nFollowing [M], let ek be the polar vector of Rk .

Then \u0002 satisfies\nthe relations R\u2032 and R\u2032\u2032 with \u00b5 = \u22121.\nProof\nWe have\n\u03c1 = order e\u2212i\u03c0\/6i\u03d53 = order e\u2212i\u03c0\/6+i\u03c0\/2+2i\u03c0\/3 = order ei\u03c0 = 2,\n\u03c3 = order e\u2212i\u03c0\/6i\u03d53 = order e\u2212i\u03c0\/6+i\u03c0\/2\u22122i\u03c0\/3 = order e\u2212i\u03c0\/3 = 6.\nTherefore, r = \u03c1 = 2 and s = \u03c3\/3 = 2. Then the relations R\u2032 are{\nRk\n6=RkRk+1RkRk+1\u22121Rk\u22121Rk+1\u22121 = (R1R2R3)4 = (R3R2R1)4 = 1 : k=1, 2, 3\n}\n.\nTaking \u00b5 = \u22121, the relations R\u2032\u2032 become{(R1R2R3)\u22122R1R2 = (R2R3R1)\u22122R2R3}.\nEach of these relations follows from Proposition 5.12 except (R3R2R1)4 = 1. We now\nshow that this is a consequence of the other relations.\nFirst, observe that repeated use of the braid relations RkRk+1Rk = Rk+1RkRk+1\ngives\n(R2R1R3)2R1 = R1(R2R1R3)2.\nTherefore,\n(R3R2R1)4 = R3R16R3\u22121(R3R2R1)4\n= (R3R13R2R1R3R2R1)2\n= (R3R1R2R1R2R3R2R3R1)2\n= (R2\u22121(R2R3R1R2)R1R2R3(R2R3R1R2)R2\u22121)2\n= (R2\u22121(R3R1R2R3R1R2R3R1R2R3R1)R2\u22121)2\n= R2\u22126\n= 1.\nWe have made use only of the relations Rk6 = 1, RkRk+1Rk = Rk+1RkRk+1,\n(R1R2R3)4 = 1, and\nR1R2R3R1 = R2R3R1R2 = R3R1R2R3. \u0001\n288 FALBEL and PARKER\nAcknowledgments.
