Through a dialectical\nprocess, the appropriate use of learning technologies in meeting students' changing needs can be\nprogressively refined\nIntroduction\nHigher education and society in general are changing rapidly. The student body is more\ndiverse and larger. Arguments rage about the vocational relevance of higher education.\nThe unit of resource is declining. The way ahead appears fraught with difficulty.\nHowever, computer-based technology is advancing at breakneck speed. Is it the 5th\nCavalry charging to the rescue of the beleaguered educational troops? The argument that\nwill be advanced in this paper is that such a view is simplistic. The key issue is that\npedagogic purposes and individual student needs should be first defined so as to identify\nthe best means of meeting those purposes and needs. The general argument that dialogue\nbased on dialectical communication lies at the heart of the learning process will then be\napplied to the use of learning technology in language learning. It will be demonstrated\nhow, through a dialectical process, the appropriate use of learning technologies in\nmeeting students' changing needs can be progressively refined.\n4\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 2\nThe changing context of higher education\nThree aspects of change affecting higher education can be noted. First, the move to mass\nhigher education (Trow, 1987) has been associated with a greatly increased diversity of\nstudents. Therefore there is an added requirement to clarify the educational needs of\nindividual students in relation to their past learning and experience and their particular\nmotivation for entering higher education. The means of meeting those needs may also\ndiffer from those traditionally used in higher education not only because the needs have\nchanged but also because old methods may be inappropriate with larger student numbers\n(or too expensive with a declining unit of resource) even before consideration is given to\nthe new means available through the development of learning technology.\nThe second aspect of change influencing higher education is the continuing debate about\nthe relative importance of vocational and academic purposes in higher education.\nParticipants in the debate have tended to adopt an either\/or position, whereas the view\nadopted here, following such writers as Neave (1992), Nuttgens (1988) and Reeves (1988),\nis that there need be no fundamental conflict between higher education for academic\npurposes and that with more vocational objectives. The reasons for this view will be\nelaborated shortly.\nThe third element of change is the pace of change in modern society which means that,\ncoupled with the continuing nature of that change, much of the content of present courses\nwill be rapidly outdated (Sadytzky and Bereday, 1977). More specifically, the means of\ncommunication are rapidly changing with the growing centrality of the audio-visual\nculture of television and personal computers.\nThe central purpose of higher education\nThe effect of these changes on the main purpose of higher education depends very much\non our broader conception of society. If our conception is of a genuinely democratic\nsociety related to Popper's notion of an Open Society (Magee, 1973), then an essential\ningredient of such a society is a mass higher-education system that encourages its\nparticipants to develop their own understanding based on critical enquiry and\nindependence of thought (Honeybone, 1994). From an academic perspective, this has\nlong been seen as the hallmark of the higher forms of education (Barnett, 1990). From a\nvocational viewpoint, a similar conclusion can be reached, particularly in the previously\nmentioned context of rapid change: if the individual does not develop critical\nunderstanding, the value of higher education to the economy will be short-lived as the\nspecific content of study becomes outdated and the individual is lacking the critical skill\nof thinking through how best to act in new situations.\nBut some clarification of the word understanding is required. It is a word used with\ndifferent meanings ranging from 'reproducing content' to 'developing an individual\nconception' (Entwistle and Entwistle, 1992). In the present context it is being used with\nthe latter meaning, that is in the sense of 'conceptual understanding' which involves\nmaking connections and weaving 'bits of knowledge into an integral and cohesive whole'\n(Nickerson, 1985). However, that definition introduces another word with diverse\ninterpretations, namely knowledge. In this paper, the word is used in the wider sense\n5\nArmy King and Andrew Honeybone Needs before means: the dialectics of learning and technology\nadopted by Eraut (1992), encompassing propositional, process and personal knowledge.\nIn this formulation, knowledge is something that is being actively worked on rather than\npassively received by the learner.\nThe learning environment\nFollowing the seminal work of Marton and Saljo (1976a and b), it is argued that\nconceptual understanding can best be achieved when students adopt a deep (learning as\ntransforming) rather than a surface (learning as reproducing) approach to learning. The\naim, then, is to develop a learning environment that will encourage students to adopt a\ndeep approach and strive for conceptual understanding. Such a learning environment will\ninclude the complete setting for learning provided by a department or institution,\nincluding the curriculum, the way the curriculum is taught, the way it is assessed, the\nmaterial resources to support learning, including learning technology, and the type of\ninteraction or dialogue between staff and students.\nThis interaction, and indeed the interactions among students themselves and also with the\nmaterial resources, can be seen as central to the development of understanding: deep\nlearning leading to conceptual understanding through dialogue. However, such dialogues\nare mediated by a number of influences: the needs, learning styles (Kolb, 1984) and\nexperience of individual students, the learning and teaching styles and experience of staff,\nand the resources and technology (the means) available. Needs should come before\nmeans, but with those individual needs being reconciled with the collective purpose of\nhigher education. This argument will now be developed using language learning (within a\ncommunicative approach) as an example. We learn to comprehend the world, to\nunderstand it better. At every stage, we need to communicate our interpretation of our\ncomprehension of the world (to start with, comprehension of our immediate\nenvironment, then of a more distant one) to ourselves and to others. In order to do so we\nuse language.\nThis paper, then, considers the particular role of learning technology in aiding dialogue in\nlanguage learning.\nDialogue as a model of communication\nThe word dialogue comes from the Greek dialogos. It is in its first meaning a conversation\nbetween two people, encompassing the notion of critical enquiry (Plato, 1965; Russell,\n1991) in which the learner engages in a process of questioning conventional knowledge.\nDialogue cannot be divorced from social interaction and, as face-to-face conversation, it\ncan be seen as the basic model from which all other forms of human communication\nultimately derive (Good, 1995).\nIn a dialogue, both the speaker and the listener are actively engaged collaboratively in a\nreciprocal activity (Brown, 1986). (Brown was writing in the context of language learning,\nbut similar arguments have been advanced for the centrality of dialogue in the sphere of\nlearning in general - see Gibbs, 1992.) Both participants in the dialogue are, in turn,\nspeaker and listener, and as such co-operate actively in constructing a coherent\ninterpretation of each other's texts. Together they construct the communicative message.\n6\nVolume 4 Number 2\nSuch communication, i.e. the construction of a joint discourse, is based on interaction\nencompassing both receptive (particularly listening) and productive (particularly\nspeaking) skills. Such an interaction is today understood to be made up of many elements\nencompassing both the linguistic and social\/cultural sides, and is viewed as central to\nlanguage learning. It takes into account the knowledge and competence of many areas -\nobviously linguistic competence (lexical, grammatical, semantic and phonological) and\nsocio-linguistic competence (politeness conventions, registers), but also general\ncompetences such as knowledge of the world , socio-cultural knowledge (knowledge of\nsociety and culture of the target community), and inter-cultural awareness (awareness of\nthe differences between the world of origin and the world of the target community).\nIntentionality\nThus, as Brown (1986) argues, dialogue is 'a risky business'. At every stage of the\nconstruction of the message, both participants make choices on what seems to be the\nmost appropriate interpretation of each other's texts, and they construct appropriate\nmental representations. They do so in order to allow the common message to be woven as\nsuccessfully as possible. Here it might be appropriate to explain the notion of\nintentionality in a dialogic interaction. If we subscribe to the widespread belief that we\nlearn languages to communicate, then it is legitimate to assume that intentionality plays\nan important role in successful communication, intentionality not just on the part of the\nspeaker but also on the part of the listener (Brown, 1986). Just as the speaker speaks with\nintent, so the listener listens with intent (The way in which learning technologies may be\nable to accommodate the variations in intentions of individual learners will be considered\nlater.) Indeed, it could be argued that if the listener is not intent on playing his part fully\nin such an interaction and chooses not to co-operate, the result would be at best\nmisunderstanding, and at worst breakdown in communication. Some linguists believe\nthat misunderstanding rather than understanding is common in communicative\ninteractions (Spolsky, 1995), and that its wide prevalence signals the difficulty of\nunderstanding.\nContext\nIf the dialogic process leading to understanding is fraught with difficulty, it is not an\nimpossible task. There are parameters which can help to ensure a more successful\ncommunication. One such parameter is context Context here is used in its wider\ninterpretation encompassing the notions of background, mutual and shared knowledge\n(Shank and Burnstein, 1985). Communication is seen as 'the reduction of uncertainty,\nwhere speakers fill in the gaps in each other's knowledge, negotiating meaning and\nmodifying their own knowledge interpretations as the discourse progresses' (Brown,\n1989). In such approaches, context helps the listener to predict what the speaker is likely\nto say. The more the participants know about each other, the closer their social\nbackground, the more similar their use of language, and the more mutual the knowledge\nthey share, the more successful the communication. In a familiar setting, with a familiar\nspeaker, on a familiar topic, the listener tends to find that many of her or his predictions\nare correct. In those circumstances, meaning is negotiated and understanding is\ndeveloping, thus a more successful discourse progresses.\nGenres of language use\nOf course, not every communicative interaction has the same level of'risk'. For example,\n7\nAnny King and Andrew Honeybone Needs before means: the dialectics of learning and technology\nprovided you are a reasonable intermediate speaker of French (GCSE-type level), it is\nunlikely that you would go into a bakery in France with the intention of buying 'deux\ncroissants' and that you would come out carrying a dozen cakes. Apart from the\nfamiliarity of the topic and the setting and predictability of the language, the genre of\nlanguage needed is not conceptually very demanding. In the sphere of language learning,\nthe different genres of language used at any particular point in a communicative task can\nlessen or heighten the difficulty of understanding, and thus whether the message is\nsuccessfully elaborated or not. The ease or difficulty of understanding is linked to the\namount of cognitive load imposed on the participants in an interaction. The less the\ncognitive load, the easier the understanding. The more demanding the cognitive load, the\nmore difficult the understanding. In language learning terms, the simplicity or complexity\nof language needed in such interactions must always be taken into account. The language\nneeded in transactions such as the one described above is conceptually less demanding\nthan the language needed to engage in an argumentative discussion of Sartre's assertion\nthat Tenfer, c'est les autres'.\nA brief explanation of what is meant by genres of language may serve to clarify the point\nThere are broadly speaking four genres of language: procedural, transactional, narrative\nand argumentative.\nProcedural language deals mainly with instructions (how to do something, how to get\nsomewhere etc.), and it is barely necessary to understand the language in a linguistic\nmode, in the sense of being able to repeat it back or constructing a summary of what has\nbeen said (Brown, 1995).\nTransactional language deals mainly with everyday-life situations (buying something,\nasking for information, requesting a service), and it is highly predictable and familiar. The\nlanguage needed is functional, and covers certain structures and forms of language. In\nspatial and temporal terms it is usually a here-and-now affair.\nNarrative language is found in reports, historical documents, anecdotes, the planning of\nfuture events as well as novels or short stories. It involves the ability to understand\ncontent in a temporal sequence of events, in a given spatial domain (Brown, 1995).\nUnderstanding a narrative is more demanding conceptually since the listener must carry\nin her mind at all times a reconstructed interpretation of the sequence of events both\nspatially and temporally, and try and make sense of the causality and intentionality of\nrelationships.\nFinally there is the language of arguments, explanations, justifications, theorizing.\nCompared with procedural or transactional languages (and to a certain extent narrative\nlanguage), argumentative language has less connection to the real, physical world. It is\nmore abstract and complex, and fewer concrete props are available to the listener engaged\nin such a dialogue. The cognitive load on the participants is even greater than in\nnarratives. Understanding a theory, an argument or a justification is mainly done through\nthe medium of linguistic input. Both participants in such a dialogue must infer a lot in\ntheir interpretations of each other's constructs and their relationships.\n8\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 2\nThe communicative approach in language learning\nIn the past, the academic study of foreign languages was primarily to allow learners to\nread literature in the original text. As such, the learning of language was primarily the\nlearning of the written form of language. And yet understanding the spoken language is\none of the requirements for language learning in order to make it your own (what\nlinguists call language acquisition).\nThe move towards a wider view was advanced in the 1960s by the pioneering work of\nLado who distinguished four skills in language learning: listening, speaking, reading and\nwriting (Lado, 1964). In the 1970s, building on Lado's ideas, the Council of Europe's\nThreshold Level made the case for a communicative approach to language teaching\n(Council of Europe, 1976). Such an approach promotes language learning as a social\nactivity; it has a functional view of language learning, and emphasizes the social roles of\nsocial interactants. Similar ideas on the importance of social interaction have been\napplied to learning in general, for example in the advocacy of problem-based learning\n(Margetson, 1994).\nA communicative approach is based on three fundamental principles. The first and\ncentral one is that of learners' needs; the second one is that of learner-centredness, and the\nfinal principle is the primacy of the functionality of language use over its form.\nCommunication with others can be through the medium of oral or written discourse, and\nsince the development of new technologies, it can be both oral and written\nsimultaneously. It is precisely this simultaneity of access to both forms of language that\ngives new technologies a vital place in the language-learning process.\nDialectical communication and new learning technology\nBuilding on the original definition, dialogue can be interpreted more widely to include\ndialogue with self and dialogue with technology whatever the technology - be it a text,\nvideo or hypertext. It is in this wider interpretation that dialogue can be seen as the key to\nlearning (Mayes, 1995), and one which can be transformed by technology (Good, 1995).\nHowever, it would be simplistic to suggest that a more technologically-based dialogue\nwould necessarily help to maintain, in the present move to mass higher education, an\nappropriate critical perspective. For that perspective to be maintained (and maybe\nenhanced), new means of dialogue must ensure a continuing interaction between the\nparticipants, leading to qualitative change, i.e. greater conceptual understanding. That, it\nis argued, can be aided by a particular form of dialogue based on Hegel's notion of\ndialectical communication, that is 'the development of thought which tends towards a\nsynthesis (union of contradictions) striving continually to resolve oppositions between\neach thesis (affirmation) and its antithesis (negation)' (Larousse 1986). Through such a\ndialectical interaction, students construct their own understanding and interpretation of\nknowledge. And that could be a key test of the appropriate use of learning technology in\nhigher education: does it aid understanding and interpretation?\nNon-reciprocal\/reciprocal\nIn answering this question, the distinction between reciprocal and non-reciprocal\ncommunication is helpful (Widdowson, 1978). In an oral\/written dialogue between two\n9\nAnn\/ King and Andrew Hone\/bone Needs before means: the dialectics of learning and technology\npeople, both participants are overtly and actively engaged in a reciprocal activity\n(speaking to one another or writing letters to one another). However, in listening to the\nradio, watching TV or reading an article, while the listener\/viewer\/reader may still be\nactively engaged, the dialogue is a covert and internal one with the producer's\/writer's\nmessage. It is a non-reciprocal activity.\nThe latest developments in learning technology are overcoming the restrictions of non-\nreciprocal communication, and thus are better able to aid understanding and\ninterpretation. New technologies are intrinsically non-linear, allow more choice and just-\nin-time access to the learner, and with their never-ending supply of integrated resources\ncan make learning in general and learning a language in particular a virtual reality.\nThese five points of non-linearity, choice, just in time, integration and virtuality which\nmultimedia brings to the learning process, can make language learning a richer, freer,\nmore satisfying and ultimately qualitatively different learning experience. They will\nshortly be considered in more detail.\nLinearity\/non-linearity\nIt is non-controversial to say that the written form of language is linear. On the one hand,\nthe medium (print) demands it. On the other, the writer writes her books\/articles with the\nreader in mind. In that sense, the writer takes every step necessary to produce a printed\ntext with the following elements in mind: shared knowledge of the world and of the topic\nin discussion, of the reader's reactions, and of the forms and structures of the language.\nShe intends the message to be understood: it is perhaps in this light that Krashen's\n'comprehensible input' should be primarily viewed (Krashen, 1985). Therefore, the writer\norganizes the arguments and presents them in a way that conventions dictate and that is\nboth clear and logical, taking, so to speak, the reader gently by the hand. This is not to\nsay that the reader does not stop here and there to dispute\/counter-argue with the writer's\nmessage - some readers do. Indeed, this internal dialogue with the writer's message, this\ndeconstruction and reconstruction of the message, is vital to deep learning (Honeybone,\n1994). In language-learning terms, this process is inherent to the learning of the foreign\nlanguage since each person's construct-language must be, to some extent, an individual\nconstruct (Brown et al, 1994), as indeed it can be argued for learning in general\n(Sutherland, 1992).\nHowever, with the linear written text, the learner's attempts to construct his own message\nis made more complex by the fact that language is just one element of communication;\ncontext (i.e. mutual and shared knowledge, background knowledge, scene-setting) as\nexplained above is also important. It is more difficult to grasp context in a printed text,\nsince meaning is approached solely or mainly through the written forms of language;\nthus, meaning must be constructed before an overall context can be revealed. On the\nother hand, visual texts (i.e. on the whole, spoken language and moving images) usually\ntranscend language and give to the learner direct access to context. They are intrinsically\nnon-linear. The language of a visual text is more diverse than that of a written text. It is\nmade up of words (linguistic elements as in the written text), images (giving context and\nsettings) and technique (angle of shots, music, pauses, rhythm of sentences, visual effects,\ncolour, rhythm of montage) (Compte, 1993). This new technology, by increasing access to\nvisual texts, can aid learning.\n10\nALT-] Volume 4 Number 2\nChoice and just-in-time concept\nWithin the same environment, the learner has access to a wide variety of texts - video,\naudio and print. He can browse through them and choose what corresponds to his needs\nin order to construct his own interpretation.\nThe 'just in time concept' of retrieval allows the learner greater choice in his learning. It\ncould be argued that multimedia gives the learner a richer, more comprehensive internal\ndialogue when he looks in the software for answers to his questions. By browsing through\nthe multimedia, incidental learning is potentially greater than if the learner were just\nreading a text or listening to a tape. However, there is the danger that the very richness\nand variety of the choice may lead to cognitive overload (Rheaume, 1993).\nIntegration\nLearning technology may help language learning further by bringing together within one\nenvironment different media - print, audio and video - thus making skills-integration\neasier and more realistic for the language learner. As previously noted, a language learner\nneeds to be competent in all four skills (speaking, listening, reading, writing), although\nnot all learners need all four skills; or, to be more precise, not all learners need to develop\nall the skills at the same level of proficiency (King, 1993). Skills are rarely acquired in\nisolation. In most commonly encountered contexts, they are integrated - indeed the\nspeaking and listening skills are at the basis of dialogue. Reading and speaking (or vice\nversa) and listening and writing (or vice versa) are acquired together since in almost all\nreal-life situations they will be used together. Different skills (needs) need different\nresources (means). Analysing learners' needs leads to analysing available resources in\norder to find out which resources serve which skills best.\nVirtu ality\nMultimedia offers the learner not just images and sounds of the country of the target\nlanguage but also opens many doors to make her feel already 'at home'. She can go to the\nLouvre and glimpse the Mona Lisa at the press of a button. She can, via a forum, ask a\nstudent in a university of the target language to tell her how life is in this university prior\nto her taking a course in this same university. The examples are numerous.\nFor all these reasons, developments in technology over the last 10 years have great\npotential to stimulate learning.. Furthermore, such technology builds on our learners'\nextensive televisual culture in our world of images (Porcher, 1976) and on their fast-\ndeveloping computer literacy acquired before entering higher education.\nThe dialectics of learning and technology\nOnce needs have been analysed, the question that arises is: which means for which needs?\nOur thesis is that as language-learning needs change and technology develops, so does the\ndialectical relationship between needs and means, i.e. between learning and technology.\nThe nature of this relationship is shown in Figure 1.\nThe thesis that earlier CALL (Computer-Assisted Language Learning) was good for the\ndevelopment of reading skills is countered by the antithesis that highlights the fact that it\nwas not suitable for other skills. A synthesis is found in later CALL which allows the\ndevelopment of not just reading skills but also to some extent listening and writing skills\n(with writing skills only in a closed context but not developed as a creative, productive\nAnny King and Andrew Honeybone Needs before means: the dialectics of learning and technology\nLEVERAGE \u2022 Hipemet across Europe\nTHESIS\nANTITHESIS\nEthnocentric system\nwithin CU\nConceptual\nSYNTHESIS\nHipemet (integrated open system)\nMultimedia + dialogue (community of learners)\nTHESIS\nANTITHESIS\nBut restricted dialogue:\nwith self and media\nNarrative\nSYNTHESIS\nMultimedia workstation.

This in turn becomes a new proposition (or new thesis) which is challenged by a\nnew antithesis that stresses the fact that in later CALL, writing is still closed and speaking\nas a skill is still missing.\n12\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 2\nAnd so the dialectical nature of learning and technology develops (Figure 1), leading to a\nnew argument (synthesis) exemplified by TLTP CKS33, a multimedia project using the\n'traditional' media of print, audio and video with contextualized and integrated CALL.\nCKS33 allows for not just a wider integration of media but also for more developed\nwriting skills. But this in turn leads to the counter argument (antithesis) that CKS33 stops\nshort of skills integration which a multimedia workstation (new synthesis) can now\nprovide. This new thesis soon highlights the fact that a multimedia workstation restricts\ndialogic communication since dialogue takes place only with self and with the technology.\nThis leads to the new proposition (synthesis) of Hipemet (High Performance Network)\nwhich is an integrated open system using the infrastructure of the Granta Backbone in\nCambridge (fibre-optic network) and which aims to develop a community of learners.\nHipernet (a RACE project) puts dialogue between learners first by encouraging a task-\nbased approach to language learning through video-conferencing while allowing learners\nto enter into a dialogue with technology through the multimedia learning tools at their\ndisposal (BBC French Means Business, a multimedia glossary). LEVERAGE (Learn from\nVideo Extensive Real ATM Gigabit Experience)1, building on Hipernet, aims to\novercome the ethnocentricity of Hipernet (system operating solely within Cambridge\nUniversity) by taking it across Europe.\nOur thesis is further strengthened by taking into account the four genres of language\nlearning as well as the four skills. Earlier technology suited the less complex genres of\nlanguage use, and it is only lately that learning technology has been able to play an\nimportant part in the learning of the more complex genres.\nProcedural and transactional genres of language can be served by CALL, and particularly\nby later CALL, since this genre of language (as previously argued) is highly predictable.\nThe narrative\/discursive genre of language (to be understood at post-GCSE level) can be\nserved by a multimedia environment since context is paramount for narrative\nunderstanding and, as previously argued, the visual text gives the learner direct access to\ncontext. Multimedia encourages the learner to follow his own train of thought or, to be\nmore precise, allows the learner to jump from one thought to another, come back to the\nfirst one and then wander around the hypermedia led by his curiosity and sense of\ndiscovery. Thus the technology is encouraging a more independent style of learning which\nmotivates the learner and enriches the learning process. As he makes more and more\ndecisions about how to fulfil his language-learning needs, the learner uses the technology\nwhich is the more appropriate to those needs.\nConceptual\/argumentative language, as stated earlier, is above all abstract with fewer\nconcrete props or links with the real, physical world. Conceptual language is used when\ncommunicating arguments, explanations, justifications, theories. Within this framework\n'communication' can be seen as encompassing the notion of Plato's critical enquiry in\nwhich the learner engages in a process of questioning conventional knowledge. In this\ncase 'dialogue' could be seen as the highest form of learning, and, with the latest\ndevelopments in technology, such a dialogue, mediated by technology, can be with others\n- peers and teachers. Until recently, dialogue using learning technology solely involved\nthe learner communicating with a system (CALL, TLTP CKS33). Now, using\ndevelopments in data communications, such as broadband technology, the learner is able\n13\nAnny King and Andrew Honeybone Needs before means: the dialectics of learning and technology\nto communicate, both with the technology and through the technology, with a wider\ncommunity of learners as is the case with Hipernet and LEVERAGE. The learner is no\nlonger restricted to the language of the teacher or the texts provided, but can herself look\nfor texts (both written and visual) that are appropriate to her needs. Furthermore, she can\nhave access to peers of the target language, making learning the target language a real and\nfulfilling experience, asking real questions to get real answers, and not having the teacher\nask her questions which the learner knows very well that the teacher already knows the\nanswers to.\nConclusion\n\u2022 These examples of the use of learning technology in language learning demonstrate that\nonce the appropriate use of technology has been initially identified and then put into\npractice, if successful, the learning technology will itself help to refine further both\npurpose and needs, leading in turn to further revisions in its use. A similar analysis could\nbe undertaken for other areas of learning.\nBut the centrality of dialectical communication in higher education goes beyond its use in\nclarifying the most appropriate pedagogic role for learning technology. It also epitomizes\nthe approach which both staff (as expert learners) and students (as novice learners)\nshould adopt towards their subjects. As Montaigne, the sixteenth-century French\nphilosopher, put it:\nC'est temoignage de erudite et d'indigestion que de regorger la viande comme on I'a\navalee. L'estomac n a pas fait son operation s'iln'afait changer la\/agon et la forme a ce\nqu'on lui avail donni a cuire.\n(It is a sign of a bad digestion to bring up food in the shape it was swallowed. The\nstomach has not done its work if it has not changed the nature and form of what it is given\nto eat.)\nAnd that, maybe, is how we should be evaluating our use of learning technology: is it\nenriching our students' diet and helping them to digest their studies and nourish their own\nunderstanding?\nNote\n1\n LEVERAGE is a project within the ACTS programme (Advanced Communications\nTechnologies and Services) made up of eight European partners aiming to encourage\ngreater international co-operation by establishing inter-country links between northern\nand southern European users, i.e. staff and students from Cambridge University, INT\n(Institut National des Telecommunications) in Paris, and Universidad Polytechnica de\nMadrid.\nReferences\nBarnett, R.
