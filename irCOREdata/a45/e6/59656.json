There are large uncertainties especially with \nthe projected extreme values, so that although an upward trend in wave height is predicted, it may \nnot be statistically significant. \nINTRODUCTION  \n \nMany global effects of climate change are now widely recognised but there \nis a need for detailed regional forecasts of these effects to enable coastal \nmanagers to plan for likely impacts. Changes in coastal wave climate, as a result \nof climate change, would have an effect on vulnerable coastal regions, \nespecially in combination with the effects of storm surges and sea level rise \n(Wolf, 2008). Waves and swell can damage the coastline, including natural and \nman-made seas defences. It is important to estimate how the wave climate might \nalter in the future as a result of anthropogenic climate change, and produce \nscenarios that are consistent with climate change predictions of other quantities. \nThe coastline of East Anglia in the UK is susceptible to flooding and cliff \nerosion (see Figure 1). In this area the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change \nResearch\u2019s Coastal Simulator (Nicholls et al. 2005; 2008) is designed to provide \nstakeholders with the ability to predict the future coastline given a choice of \nboth global future climate scenarios and local shore-line management plans. It \nuses various numerical models to create a library of predictions of future \ncoastline evolution for these choices. Independent models of offshore waves, \nstorm surges and sea level rise are used to provide input to a nearshore model \n(Stansby et al., 2006) and ultimately to a model of the coastal morphodynamics \nfor north Norfolk (Roche et al. 2008; Hall et al. 2008; Walkden et al. 2005; \n2008). \n                                                          \n \n1 Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Joseph Proudman Building, 6 Brownlow Street, \nLiverpool L3 5DA, United Kingdom \n2 Met Office Hadley Centre (Reading Unit), Department of Meteorology The University of \nReading, Earley Gate, Reading RG6 6BB, United Kingdom \n3 School of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle NE1 7RU, \nUnited Kingdom \n4 School of Civil Engineering and the Environment, University of Southampton, \nSouthampton SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom \n1 \n 2 \n \n A previous paper (Leake et al. 2008) presented earlier results from this \nstudy, showing that the North Atlantic wave model results, driven by winds \nfrom the Met Office Hadley Centre climate model, agree reasonably well \nstatistically with the ERA40 study (http:\/\/www.knmi.nl\/waveatlas, Caires et al. \n2004). It showed results for the NE Atlantic and projections for mean and \nmaximum wave height for the A2 and B2 future climate scenarios (see Table 1). \nHere we include some results of sea level and surge projections as well as \nwaves, focussing on the projected changes in offshore waves on the regional \nscale for the NW European continental shelf, and discuss the uncertainties \nassociated with estimating future trends. \n \n \n \nFigure 1.  Marine inputs to the Coastal Simulator, north Norfolk, UK \nSea-level rise \nStorm surges \nOff\u2013shore Waves \n 3 \n \n \nMODEL HIERARCHY \n \nFor the results presented here the Met Office Hadley Centre Ocean-\nAtmosphere Global climate model (OAGCM), HadCM3, was used to project \nfuture climate surface winds, which were used to drive a 1-degree wave model \nof the Atlantic Ocean. This setup allowed wave energy from the South Atlantic \nto influence the North West European shelf 12km wave model (CS3 model). In \norder to capture synoptic-scale events at mid-latitudes, the coupled climate \nmodel provides boundary conditions for 50km or 25km Regional Climate \nModels (RCM). Although the RCM is not coupled to the ocean, it is able to run \nat resolutions which may be adequate to resolve small scale atmospheric events. \nThe ocean boundary conditions in the RCM are provided by SST's from the \nGCM interpolated onto the RCM grid. The RCM is then used to drive the CS3 \nwave model domain, using lateral boundary conditions from the Atlantic wave \nmodel. Wave model output around the north Norfolk coastline in the southern \nNorth Sea is then provided for use in conjunction with tidal, sediment transport \nand wave transformation model data to investigate long term morphodynamics \nof the north Norfolk coast, and ultimately to the Coastal Simulator. Model \npredictions of local sea level and storm surges are also used as input to the \ncoastal model. This methodology could be used in generic applications \nelsewhere. \nFigure 2.

The model results for the present day were validated \nstatistically against the ERA40 wave model reanalysis (Leake et al. 2008). \n \nFuture scenarios \n \nGlobal and regional climate models are used to produce both baseline \n(present day) and future climate scenarios (IPCC 2000). These future scenarios \nare based on a range of future greenhouse gas emission scenarios, and provide a \nrange of future climates that represent a range of anthropogenic climate change \neffects (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Emissions scenarios (from IPCC AR4) \n  Emissions  Global Temp \nincrease (C) \n(1980-99 to 2090-\n99), best estimate \n(likely range)  \nCO2-equivalent \nGHG conc. \n(ppm by \nvolume) by \n2100 \n \nSLR (m) * \nA1F1 High 4.0 (2.4 \u2013 6.4) 1550 0.26 \u2013 0.59 \nA2 Medium \nHigh \n3.4 (2.0 \u2013 5.4) 1250 0.23 \u2013 0.51 \nA1B Medium 2.8 (1.7 \u2013 4.4)  \n \n880 0.21 \u2013 0.48 \nB2 Medium \nLow \n2.4 (1.4 \u2013 3.8)  \n \n800 0.20 \u2013 0.43 \n \nA1T  2.4 (1.4 \u2013 3.8)  \n \n700 0.20 \u2013 0.45 \nB1 Low 1.8 (1.1 \u2013 2.9)  \n \n600 0.18 \u2013 0.38 \nexcluding future \n* Excluding future rapid dynamical changes in ice flow \n \nHere we use a range of climate model driving data. Results from the A2 and B2 \nscenarios from a 50km RCM were used to investigate variability due to different \nfuture emissions. Results from A1B (which leads to a global temperature \nincrease intermediate between A2 and B2) were estimated for 3 versions of the \n25km RCM, to investigate the spread in results due to the differences in climate \nmodel parameters. The 3 versions span a range of climate sensitivity. The \nmodels were integrated for 2 time periods: \n\u2022 1960-1990 baseline GHG forcing \n\u2022 2070-2100 with A2 and B2 GHG forcing \n\u2022 1960-2100 with A1B GHG forcing \nIn the A1B experiments, the unperturbed climate model was integrated for the \nwhole 140-year period from 1960-2100, which enables more detailed \n 5 \n \nexamination of the decadal-scale variability. The wave model was run for the \ntwo other ensemble members for the two 30-year time-slices as in phase 1. \nRESULTS  \n \nLocal sea level consists of a mean sea level (MSL) component as well as \ntransient changes due to tides and surges. Mean sea level is projected to rise \nglobally due to climate change (see Table 1) as a result of thermal expansion \nand melting of land-ice. Results from the latest international consensus were \npublished in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (IPCC 2007). There are spatial \nvariations on a regional scale in the mean sea level projections of the order of \n+10cm and the net local sea level change depends on various factors including \nvertical land movement (VLM). Around the UK the variation due to VLM is of \nthe order of \u00b115cm. In order to examine future extreme water levels we need to \nconsider storm surges. Figure 3 shows the projected change in the 50-year \nreturn period water level around the UK, for the A2 scenario, due to changes in \natmospheric storminess, an increase in mean sea level and vertical land \nmovements (Lowe and Gregory 2005). \n        \n \n                                                                       \n1.3m \n3m \n \nFigure 3.

Results are shown for the A2 scenario (from Lowe \nand Gregory 2005) \n 6 \n \n \nFigure 4. Present-day winter mean and mean annual winter maximum wave \nheight (m) \n \nFigure 4 shows the mean and mean winter maximum wave height for the \npresent day. Maximum wave heights are seen to occur to the west of the British \nIsles, with highest waves in the NW Approaches, to the NW of Scotland. \nSmaller waves occur in the North Sea and especially the southern North Sea due \nto its being relatively sheltered from the North Atlantic, with shorter fetch for \nlocal wave generation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-ve\n+ve+ve -ve\n+veInsignificant changes  +ve based on 30-year variability \nFigure 5.

Areas of darker shading are where results are not statistically \nsignificant at 5% level \n \nFigure 5 shows the projected change in the mean and mean annual \nmaximum wave height (effectively this is the same parameter as the winter \nmaximum), for the A2 and B2 scenarios, comparing the two 30-year time-slices \n(2070-2100 versus 1960-1990). Areas where the changes are not statistically \nsignificant (by Student\u2019s t-test) have been masked out by darker shading. This \n 7 \n \nrepresents the natural variability within a 30-year period. Largest values are +2 \nand -2m. Increases are projected to the west and SW of the British Isles, with \ndecreases in the central North Sea and to the north. The A2 scenario shows an \nincrease in the eastern part of the North Sea which is not seen in B2 and A2 has \nthe largest increase to the SW whereas B2 has the largest increase to the NW. \nThese changes suggest subtle changes in storm tracks which need to be \nexamined in more detail. \nUsing the 140-year unperturbed run for the A1B scenario in phase 2 allows \nus to examine natural variability (within the climate model) over the whole \nperiod (Figure 6). In this figure a 30-year running mean has been applied to the \nwave height for a location in the southern North Sea. It may be seen that there \nare quasi-periodic variations on quite long multi-decadal time-scales. The \namount of variability means that although a long-term upward trend in wave \nheight is modeled, it is not necessarily statistically significant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6. 30-year running mean of annual maximum wave height at a point in the \nsouthern North Sea \n \nThe changes in the projected wave height in the southern North Sea are \ngenerally smaller than other areas and not always statistically significant. Some \nslight changes in wave direction are projected. The typical distribution is for \nlargest waves from the NE with a secondary peak from the SE. The future \n 8 \n \nprojection is for slightly fewer waves from the SE and more from the NE in the \nwinter, with a reversal of this pattern in the summer. This may have some \nimplications for the net long-shore sediment transport. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nWe are entering a new generation of marine climate change scenarios i.e. \nfrom just having MSL change and speculative scenarios of changes in surge and \nwaves, to transient multivariate time series outputs. This allows us to better \nquantify uncertainty in our projections of the coastal impact of climate change. \nThe existence of long period (multi-decadal) variability makes the detection of \ntrend problematic.  \n \nThe GCM-RCM-surge-wave model system is providing the boundary \nconditions for the Tyndall Centre Regional Coastal Simulator, described in other \npapers in this volume. \n  \nThe evidence for storm surge increase in north Norfolk, for the Hadley\/POL \nensemble, indicates no significant trend across the ensemble members.  \n \nOnly small changes in extreme wave heights are projected in the southern \nNorth Sea. Changes in wave direction may have more significance for coastal \nprocesses e.g. longshore sediment transport.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis work was partly funded by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change \nResearch. \nREFERENCES \nCaires, S., A.
