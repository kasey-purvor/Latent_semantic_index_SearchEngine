Received .\nABSTRACT\nWe present high signal-to-noise integrated spectra of 24 star clusters in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC), obtained using the FLAIR spectrograph at the UK Schmidt\ntelescope. The spectra have been placed onto the Lick\/IDS system in order to test\nthe calibration of Simple Stellar Population (SSP) models (Maraston & Thomas 2000;\nKurth, Fritz-von Alvensleben & Fricke 1999).\nWe have compared the SSP-predicted metallicities of the clusters with those from\nthe literature, predominantly taken from the Ca-Triplet spectroscopy of Olszewski et\nal. (1991). We find that there is good agreement between the metallicities in the range \u2013\n2.10\u2264 [Fe\/H]\u2264 0. However, the Mg2 index (and to a lesser degree Mg b) systematically\npredict higher metallicities (up to +0.5 dex higher) than \u3008Fe\u3009. Among the possible\nexplanations for this are that the LMC clusters possess [\u03b1\/Fe] > 0. Metallicities are\npresented for eleven LMC clusters which have no previous measurements.\nWe compare SSP ages for the clusters, derived from the H\u03b2, H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 Lick\/IDS\nindices, with the available literature data, and find good agreement for the vast ma-\njority. This includes six old globular clusters in our sample, which have ages consistent\nwith their HST CMD ages and\/or integrated colours. However, two globular clusters,\nNGC 1754 and NGC 2005, identified as old (\u223c 15 Gyr) on the basis of HST CMDs,\nhave H\u03b2 line-strengths which lead ages which are too young (\u223c 8 and \u223c 6 Gyr re-\nspectively). These findings are inconsistent with their CMD-derived values at the 3\u03c3\nlevel. Comparison between the horizontal branch morphology and the Balmer line-\nstrengths of these clusters suggests that the presence of blue horizontal branch stars\nhas increased their Balmer indices by up to \u223c 1.0 A\u02da.\nWe conclude that the Lick\/IDS indices, used in conjunction with contemporary\nSSP models, are able to reproduce the ages and metallicities of the LMC clusters\nreassuringly well. The required extrapolations of the fitting-functions and stellar li-\nbraries in the models to younger ages and low metallicities do not lead to serious\nsystematic errors. However, due to the significant contribution of horizontal branch\nstars to Balmer indices, SSP model ages derived for metal-poor globular clusters are\nambiguous without a priori knowledge of horizontal branch morphology.\nKey words: galaxies: individual: LMC \u2013 galaxies: star clusters\n1 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the most powerful tools available to observers of stel-\nlar populations is the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD).\nWhilst there still remain numerous uncertainties in stellar\n\u22c6 email: mbeasley@astro.swin.edu.au\n\u2020 email: hoyle@venus.physics.drexel.edu\n\u2021 email: R.M.Sharples@dur.ac.uk\nevolution theory (e.g. Castellani, Degl\u2019Innocenti, & Prada\nMoroni 2001), the existence of accurate paralaxes such as\nthose from HIPPARCOS, used in conjunction with con-\ntemporary model isochrones can now constrain the ages of\nGalactic globular clusters (GCs) to within \u223c 20% (e.g. Car-\nretta et al. 2000).\nFurthermore, HST has allowed us to obtain detailed\ninformation for GCs and field stars in external galaxies such\nas the LMC (e.g. Holtzman et al. 1997; Olsen et al. 1998;\nJohnson et al. 1999), the Andromeda galaxy (e.g. Holland,\n2 M.A. Beasley, F. Hoyle and R.M. Sharples\nFahlman, & Richer 1996; Fusi Pecci et al. 1996) and even the\nnearest large elliptical Centaurus A (e.g. Soria et al. 1996;\nHarris, Poole, & Harris 1998; Harris, Harris, & Poole 1999;\nMarleau et al. 2000).\nHowever, such observations are challenging, and beyond\nseveral Mpc exceed the capabilities of current instrumenta-\ntion. Even with HST, a combination of crowding and the\nintrinsic faintness of single stars limits the applicability of\nsuch an approach. Therefore, in order to probe the proper-\nties of distant stellar systems, we must rely upon studies of\nintegrated light.\nIntegrated spectroscopy and photometry require com-\nparisons with stellar population models, and are affected\nby a degeneracy between age and metallicity (Faber 1972;\nO\u2019Connell 1976). Spectroscopic indices have been shown\nto hold potential, and much work in the past decade has\nlead to age-metallicity diagnostics for integrated spectra\n(e.g. Gonza\u00b4lez 1993; Rose 1994; Worthey 1994; Borges et al.\n1995; Idiart & Pacheco 1995; Worthey & Ottaviani 1997;\nVazdekis & Arimoto 1999). These methods have subse-\nquently been used by many workers to derive ages and\nmetallicities for galaxies (e.g. Davies, Sadler, & Peletier\n1993; Gonza\u00b4lez 1993; Fisher, Franx, & Illingworth 1995;\nKuntschner & Davies 1998; Vazdekis et al. 2001) and extra-\ngalactic globular clusters (e.g. Cohen, Blakeslee, & Ryzhov\n1998; Kissler-Patig et al. 1998; Beasley et al. 2000; Forbes\net al. 2001).\nHowever, the reliability of such integrated techniques\nhas yet to be demonstrated: they must be tested against\nstellar systems with independently derived age and metal-\nlicity estimates such as Galactic GCs. Addressing this issue,\nGibson et al. (1999) derived a \u2019spectroscopic\u2019 age for 47 Tu-\ncanae in the H\u03b3HR \u2013 Fe4668 and H\u03b3HR \u2013 CaIHR planes of\nthe Worthey (1994; henceforth W94) simple stellar popula-\ntion (SSP) models. These authors found that 47 Tuc\u2019s in-\ntegrated spectrum fell below the oldest (17 Gyr) isochrones\nof the W94 models at the 4\u03c3 level, yielding an extrapolated\nage in excess of 20 Gyr. By comparison, the CMD-derived\nage of 47 Tuc is 14 \u00b1 1 Gyr (Richer et al. 1996). On the\nother hand, Maraston & Thomas (2000) derived an age of 15\nGyrs for this cluster using the combination H\u03b2 and Fe5335,\nin good agreement with the CMD of Richer et al. (1996).\nVazdekis et al. (2001) and Schiavon et al. (2002) have re-\ncently addressed these issues and conclude that the inclusion\nof atomic diffusion and non-solar abundance ratios are im-\nportant. Moreover, Schiavon et al. (2002) found it necessary\nto include both AGB stars and adjust the metallicity of 47\nTuc by \u20130.05 dex to fit their SSP models to the integrated\nspectrum of this cluster.\nWhilst these developments are extremely promising, the\nfull calibration of SSP models has yet to be comprehensively\ntested. The Galactic GC 47 Tuc represents a single age and\nsingle metallicity in the large parameter space of contem-\nporary SSP models. In view of the adjustments employed\nSchiavon et al. 2001 in order to reproduce the integrated\nspectrum of just this cluster, begs the question of how well\ncan these models be applied to more distant, less well-known\nstellar systems? Furthermore, 47 Tuc is an idealised case\nof an old, relatively metal-rich stellar system which has a\n\u2019red clump\u2019 for its horizontal branch (HB). In this case, the\nstrength of the Balmer lines are thought to be primarily a\nfunction of the temperature of the main sequence turn-off\n(and hence age). At lower metallicities\u00a7 GCs develop blue\nHBs which are expected to contribute a significant compo-\nnent to Balmer lines (e.g. Buzzoni 1989; de Freitas Pacheco\n& Barbuy 1995; Lee, Yoon, & Lee 2000; Maraston & Thomas\n2000).\nOn the observational side, obtaining integrated spectra\nof Galactic GCs may hide other uncertainties. Owing to the\nlarge angular size of Galactic GCs on the sky (the half-light\nradius of 47 Tuc is \u223c 2.8 \u2032) a spectroscopic aperture must be\nsynthesised by physically scanning a slit across the cluster.\nIn so doing, the observer may unwittingly include foreground\nstars in the integrated spectrum, in addition to increasing\nthe liklihood of stochastic contributions from bright stars.\nClearly, alternative laboratories are desirable to test SSP\nmodels.\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) presents an ideal\ntarget for such tests. Many of its \u223c 2000 star clusters (Ol-\nszewski, Suntzeff, & Mateo 1996) have been independently\nage-dated and their metallicities determined, whilst its prox-\nimity (\u223c 53 kpc) means that acquiring high S\/N, inte-\ngrated spectra of the clusters is relatively straightforward\n(e.g. Rabin 1982).\nIn this paper, we present high S\/N integrated spectra\nfor 24 star clusters in the LMC, covering a wide range in\nage (0.5 \u2013 17 Gyr) and metallicity (\u20132.1 \u2264 [Fe\/H] \u2264 0).\nWe have placed the clusters onto the Lick\/IDS system and\nmeasured their line-strength indices in order to test contem-\nporary stellar population models which use the Lick\/IDS\nfitting-functions (Gorgas et al. 1993; Worthey et al. 1994;\nWorthey & Ottaviani 1997).\nThe plan of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, we de-\nscribe our sample selection and the observations performed\nfor this present study. In Section 3 we describe the reduc-\ntion steps required for our fibre spectra. We discuss the\nspectroscopic system and the stellar population models we\nuse in this study in Section 4. In Section 5, we derive ages\nand metallicities for the LMC clusters using the SSP mod-\nels, which we then compare to literature values. Finally, we\npresent our conclusions and a summary in Section 6.\n2 SAMPLE SELECTION AND OBSERVATIONS\n2.1 Star Clusters in the LMC\nSearle, Wilkinson, & Bagnuolo (1980; henceforth SWB)\ndevised a one-dimensional classification scheme for LMC\nstar clusters using integrated Gunn-Thuan photometry, and\nshowed that the clusters primarily form an age sequence\nin the Q(ugr)-Q(vgr) diagram, with metallicity becoming\nincreasingly important for the oldest clusters. SWB as-\nsigned \u2019SWB-types\u2019 I\u2013VII to the clusters, with I represent-\ning young, blue clusters through to VII, old and metal-poor\nclusters\u2014essentially analogues of Milky Way GCs.\nSubsequently, Frenk & Fall (1982) showed that the same\nsequence was apparent in the \u2019equivalent\u2019 (U-B) vs (B-V) di-\nagram, which they termed \u2019E-SWB\u2019. Elson & Fall (1985) and\nElson & Fall (1988) determined an age calibration for these\nSWB types by using literature age estimates, determined\n\u00a7 but see Rich et al. (1997) for two examples of relatively metal-\nrich Galactic GCs with blue HBs.\nTesting Stellar Population Models with Star Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud 3\nfrom either CMDs, integrated spectra, or from the extent\nof their asymptotic giant branches (e.g.Mould & Aaronson\n(1982). In this paper, we employ SWB-types to segregate\nthe LMC clusters into age\/metallicity groups for our anal-\nysis, using the revised age calibration given in Bica, Claria,\n& Dottori (1992). \u00b6\nOur spectroscopic sample was selected on the basis of\nthe availability of independent age and metallicity estimates\nfor the clusters, SWB type and concentration. This final cri-\nterion was important so that we were able to match the core\nradii of the clusters to the size of the 6\u2032\u2032 fibres of the FLAIR\nspectrograph (see below), thereby minimising background\ncontamination. We took particular care to include SWB VII\n(globular) clusters in our sample, which have HST CMDs.\nIntegrated colours, magnitudes and positions for our cluster\nsample were drawn from the catalogue of Bica et al. (1999),\nwith SWB-types obtained from the earlier catalogue of Bica\net al. (1996).\nOur total spectroscopic sample comprised of SWB I\u2013VII\nclusters. However, for the purposes of this analysis, only the\nclusters of type IVA (\u223c 0.4 Gyr) and older will be considered\nfurther, since the Lick\/IDS fitting-functions were only calcu-\nlated for ages of 0.5 Gyr and older (see Worthey et al. 1994).\nWe list the 24 clusters in our sample for which we have ob-\ntained useful spectra in Table 1, along with their basic physi-\ncal parameters. In addition, we give heliocentric radial veloc-\nities for the clusters obtained from cross-correlation against\ntemplate stars. Although the resolution of our spectra is too\nlow for accurate radial velocities, an approximate velocity is\nrequired in order to shift the spectra to the rest-frame for\nthe measurement of line-strength indices. We have achieved\nS\/N ratios of 66 \u2013 340 A\u02da\u22121, calculated in the 5000A\u02da region\nof the spectra (note that for the older clusters transmitted\nflux at the H\u03b3 feature is typically a factor of \u223c 2 lower than\nat 5000A\u02da, i.e. a factor of\n\u221a\n2 lower in S\/N.)\nIn Figure 1 we show the distribution of our cluster sam-\nple in the U \u2212 B, B \u2212 V colour planes. The different SWB\nclassifications are marked in the figure. The 24 clusters anal-\nysed in this present study are marked as filled triangles, and\nare all SWB-type IVA or later. Note that, as one goes to\nolder ages (higher SWB types), age and metallicity effects\nbecome more entangled, increasing the likelihood of misclas-\nsification of the clusters (e.g. see Section 5.1).\n2.2 The FLAIR System\nThe observations were performed with the Fibre-Linked\nArray-Image Reformatter (FLAIR) system (Parker & Wat-\nson 1995), a multi-object fibre spectroscopy system at\nthe AAO\u2019s 1.2-metre UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST). The\nSchmidt photographic plates possess a useful field area of 40\ndeg2, with a radius of the un-vignetted field of 2.7 deg. Our\ncandidate clusters were identified on the Schmidt plates and\nFLAIR fibres were attached to copies of these plates using\nmagnetic buttons.\nThe observations of the star clusters in the LMC were\ncarried out over the nights of the 3\u20137th November 1999.\n\u00b6 As part of this classification, Bica, Claria, & Dottori (1992)\nsplit the SWB IV class into IVA and IVB, corresponding to bluer\nand redder colours respectively.\nFigure 1.

However, as shown in\n\u00a7 4.4, no gross systematic offsets are introduced into our\nanalysis because of this.\nTesting Stellar Population Models with Star Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud 5\n3 DATA REDUCTION\nThese CCD data were reduced using the dofibers and\nflair packages within iraf. The object frames where all\ntrimmed and bias-corrected using the multiple bias-frames\ntaken at the time of the observations. The first-order fibre-\nto-fibre response was corrected using the triangle task.\nFlat-field and arc-lamp spectra were extracted concurrently\nwith the object spectra.\nFor the flat-field corrections, pixel-to-pixel variations in\nthe detector were dealt with as well as the differences in\nthroughput between the fibres. A response normalisation\nfunction for the fibres was calculated from the extracted\nflats, and the flat field spectra were normalised by the mean\ncounts of all the fibres, after division by the response spectra.\nBecause of the differing fibre-to-fibre response of FLAIR, the\nspectra were not flux-calibrated, but left with the instrumen-\ntal response characteristic of the spectroscopic system. As\nshown in \u00a7 4.4 this is corrected for in our final line-strength\nindices.\nThe spectra were wavelength calibrated using the\nmercury-cadmium-helium arc-lines taken between expo-\nsures. The rms in the fit to the 12 arc features was typi-\ncally \u223c 0.1 A\u02da. The spectra were then re-binned onto a linear\nwavelength scale. Prior to measuring line-strength indices,\nthe spectra were corrected to their rest-frame wavelengths\nusing the radial velocities given in Table 1.\nExamples of our spectra for SWB-types IVA \u2013 VII are\nshown in Figure 2. A principle feature of the spectra are\nthe weakening of the Balmer-lines as one goes to later SWB\ntypes. It is also interesting to note the rapid change in the\nspectra between SWB IVA and SWB IVB, characterised by\nthe developing G-band at 4300 A\u02da, and the increasing promi-\nnence of other metallic-lines.\n4 THE SPECTROSCOPIC SYSTEM\n4.1 The Lick\/IDS Indices\nComprehensive discussions of the Lick\/IDS absorption-line\nindex system, the derived absorption-line index fitting func-\ntions and observations of stars, galaxies and GCs have been\ngiven in a series of papers by the Lick group (Burstein\net al. 1984; Faber et al. 1985; Burstein, Faber, & Gon-\nzalez 1986; Gorgas et al. 1993; Worthey 1994; Trager\net al. 1998).\nWe have measured 20 Lick\/IDS indices, 16 of which are\nlisted in Trager et al. (1998), supplemented by a further 4\nindices defined in Worthey & Ottaviani (1997) which mea-\nsure higher-order Balmer lines H\u03b3A, H\u03b4A (40 A\u02da wide feature\nbandpass) and H\u03b3F, H\u03b4F (a narrower 20 A\u02da wide bandpass).\nDue to the high S\/N of our data, we derive our uncertainty\nin the measured indices from two sources: We use Poisson\nstatistics to determine the photon statistical error in our\ndata, both in terms of measuring counts in the feature and\nin the placing of the continuum bandpass (e.g. Rich 1988).\nThis is added in quadrature to duplicate observations of the\nLMC clusters to assess the repeatability of our measure-\nments. We show comparisons between the Lick\/IDS indices\nmeasured for clusters common between fields LMC 1 and\nLMC 2 in Figure 3. To quantify this repeatability, we list\nFigure 2. Integrated spectra of the LMC clusters, represent-\ning each SWB type. The spectra have been smoothed to the\nresolution of the Lick\/IDS system, and have been continuum-\nnormalised by division with a low-order polynomial.\nthe mean offset, standard deviation on the mean and linear\ncorrelation co-efficient (r) for each index in Table 5.\nInspection of Figure 3 and Table 5 indicates that our re-\npeatability for the indices is variable, from excellent (e.g. H\u03b2,\nMg b) to very poor (e.g. Fe5015). However, the majority of\nthe Lick\/IDS indices do show good agreement. For N = 11,\nan r value of 0.8 corresponds to a 3\u03c3 significant linear cor-\nrelation (Taylor 1982). Therefore, we take r \u2265 0.8 as the\nthreshold for our being able to reproduce any given index at\nhigh confidence.\nOur inability to accurately reproduce Ca4227, and to\na lesser extent Fe5015, may be due to the narrow nature\nof their bandpass definitions. For example, the Ca4227 fea-\nture is 12.5 A\u02da (\u223c5 pixels) wide, and its blue-red continuum\nendpoints bracket only 40 A\u02da (\u223c 15 pixels). As indicated by\nTripicco & Bell (1995), Ca4227 is both very sensitive to\nbandpass placement, in addition to being sensitive to spec-\ntral resolution.\n4.2 Calibrating to the Lick\/IDS System\nThe Lick\/IDS spectra were all obtained with the 3-\nmetre Shane Telescope at the Lick Observatory (hence the\nLick system), using the Cassegrain Image Dissector Scan-\nner (IDS) spectrograph. The spectra have a wavelength-\ndependent resolution (FWHM) of 8\u201310 A\u02da (increasing at\nboth the blue and red ends) and cover a spectral region\nof 4000\u20136400 A\u02da. The original Lick\/IDS spectra are not flux-\ncalibrated, but were normalised by division with a quartz-\niodide tungsten lamp. These two idiosyncrasies of the IDS\n6 M.A. Beasley, F. Hoyle and R.M. Sharples\nFigure 3. The repeatability of our measurements of Lick\/IDS indices between fields LMC 1 (x-axis) and LMC 2 (y-axis), compared in\neach case to unit slope (solid line). The uncertainties on the measurements are derived purely from Poisson statistics.\nrequire that data from other telescopes be accurately cor-\nrected onto the Lick\/IDS system.\nSo as to reproduce the resolution characteristics of the\nIDS as shown in Worthey & Ottaviani (1997), we convolved\nour spectra with a wavelength-dependent Gaussian kernel.\nSince the FLAIR spectra have a useful wavelength range of\n4000A\u02da \u2013 5500A\u02da, our spectra were correspondingly broadened\nto the Lick\/IDS resolution of 8.5 A\u02da \u2013 11.5 A\u02da. To remove\nany remaining systematic offsets between FLAIR and the\nLick\/IDS we observed 11 Lick standard stars (Table 4). For\nthese stars we measured all the Lick\/IDS indices within our\nuseful wavelength range, and compared them to the tabu-\nlated values to obtain additive offsets to apply to our data.\nWe compare our measured Lick indices for our FLAIR stan-\ndard stars with the corresponding Lick values in Figure 4.\nIn Table 6 we then list the offsets required to achieve zero\noffset, and thereby calibrate our data onto the Lick\/IDS sys-\ntem.\nA number of the offsets between the Lick\/IDS measure-\nments and those obtained here are substantial, in particular\nthe CN1, CN2, Mg1 and Mg2 indices. All of these indices pos-\nsess wide side-bands, implying that the origin of the offsets\nare continuum slope differences due to the fact the FLAIR\nspectra are not flux-calibrated. As shown in \u00a7 4.4, the ad-\nditive offsets given in Table 6 calibrate these indices to the\nLick\/IDS system. The final corrected Lick\/IDS indices for\nthe LMC star clusters and their associated uncertainties are\ngiven in Table A1.\n4.3 The SSP Models\nThe models we use in this study are those of Maraston\n& Thomas (2000), Kurth, Fritze-v. Alvensleben, & Fricke\n(1999; henceforth KFF99) and W94. By definition, SSP\nmodels assume a single burst of star formation, which occurs\nin the first time-step of the model, subsequently followed by\nTesting Stellar Population Models with Star Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud 7\nFigure 4.

The above mod-\nels which assume a Salpeter IMF are adopted, although the\nexact choice of IMF is at best a second-order effect when\ncompared to uncertainties in the fitting-functions and mass-\nloss parameter (e.g. Lee, Yoon, & Lee 2000; Maraston, Greg-\ngio, & Thomas 2001).\nThe evolutionary synthesis models of Maraston &\nThomas (2000) deal with post-main sequence stellar evolu-\ntion using the Fuel Consumption Theorem (Renzini & Buz-\nzoni 1986). The \u2019thermal-pulsing asymptotic giant branch\u2019\nphase is calibrated upon observations of Magellanic Cloud\nstar clusters. The Maraston & Thomas (2000) models adopt\nclassical non-overshooting stellar tracks (Cassisi et al. 1998).\nThese models span a metallicity range of \u20132.25 \u2264 [Fe\/H] \u2264\n+0.67, and an age range from 30 Myr to 15 Gyr. In def-\nerence to the previous discussions on the limitations of the\nLick\/IDS fitting functions, we only consider models with\nages \u2265 0.5 Gyr.\nThe KFF99 models employ isochrone synthesis, using\nthe stellar tracks from the Padova group (Fagotto et al. 1994,\nand references therein) which incorporate convective over-\nshoot. A Monte-Carlo method is employed by these authors\nto avoid the problems of interpolating between isochrones.\nThe KFF99 models cover an age-metallicity parameter space\nof 0.5 \u2264 t \u2264 16 Gyr, and \u20132.3 \u2264 [Fe\/H] \u2264 +0.4. Unfortu-\nnately, these models do not predict line-strength indices for\nthe H\u03b3 and H\u03b4 indices.\nThe original population synthesis models of W94 cover\nan age-metallicity parameter space of 1.5 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 17 Gyr\nand \u20130.5 \u2264 [Fe\/H] \u2264 0.5. To encompass old, metal-poor\npopulations, these models were subsequently extended to\nbracket \u20132.0 \u2264 [Fe\/H] \u2264 \u20130.5 for ages 8 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 17 Gyr, cal-\nibrated using Galactic GCs. The W94 models do not cover\nthe young, metal-poor characteristics of the majority of the\nLMC clusters, making them of value only for the old GCs in\nthis present study. However, since the W94 models predict\n8 M.A. Beasley, F. Hoyle and R.M. Sharples\nTable 5.

To this end, we compare different Lick\/IDS indices\nof the clusters which measure similar chemical species (or\nare at least influenced by these same elements e.g. Tripicco\n& Bell 1995). By plotting these indices against each other\nonto SSP grids, which are effectively degenerate in age and\nmetallicity, we can look for evidence of any systematic offsets\nin these data (e.g. Kuntschner & Davies 1998).\nIn Figure 5 we show index-index plots of the Mg b,\nMg1 and Mg2 indices of the clusters, compared to the W94\nmodels. We find that, despite the apparent small range of\nmetallicity covered by the clusters due to the \u2019squashing\u2019\nof the model grids, the agreement between the models and\nthese data is good. The absence of any significant offsets\nfrom the W94 models indicates that our resolution correc-\ntions, and the corrections derived from the Lick standard\nstars are accurate.\nThe agreement between the iron indices (Figure 6) is\nalso generally good. The scatter in the figure is somewhat\nlarger than for Figure 5, reflecting the greater statistical\nuncertainty in measuring these weaker features.\nIn Figure 7 we compare the Balmer-line indices of the\nLMC clusters with the models of Maraston & Thomas. We\ndo not use the W94 models here since they do not reach to\nsufficiently young ages. In each of the panels in Figure 7,\nages become progressively younger from the bottom-left to\ntop right, indicating that the LMC clusters possess a sig-\nnificant range in age. Notice that the panels in Figure 7\nwhich include H\u03b2 as one co-ordinate are not degenerate,\ndemonstrating the increased age-sensitivity of H\u03b2 over the\nTesting Stellar Population Models with Star Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud 9\nFigure 6.

As discussed in \u00a7 2.1,\nSWB80 grouped the LMC clusters into SWB-types, depend-\ning upon their Q(ugr)-Q(vgr) colours. Since the SWB rank-\ning is effectively one of age, this should be reflected in the\nlocus of the SWB types on the SSP grids. For the conve-\nnience of the reader, we reproduce the age groups for SWB\ntypes I\u2013VII in Table 7, as given by the calibration of Bica,\nClaria, & Dottori (1992).\nIn Figures 8 to 12, we show the metallicity-sensitive\n\u3008Fe\u3009, Mg b and Mg2 indices versus the more age-sensitive\nH\u03b2, H\u03b3F , and H\u03b4F indices of the LMC clusters. In each case,\nwe compare them to the SSP models of KFF99, Maraston\n& Thomas and W94.\nOur goal is to empirically test the age and metallicity\npredictions of SSP models which predict line-strength in-\ndices in the Lick\/IDS system, rather than provide an exhaus-\ntive comparison between different models (e.g. see Maraston,\nGreggio, & Thomas 2001). However, there are clearly signif-\nicant differences between the SSP models, which warrant\nsome discussion before using them to derive ages and metal-\nlicities for the clusters.\nPerhaps the most noticeable difference between the\nmodels is the much smaller parameter space covered by the\nW94 models As discussed in \u00a7 4.3, the majority of the LMC\nclusters do not fall onto the W94 grids, indicating that the\nW94 models will only be useful for the oldest clusters. Direct\ncomparison between the KFF99 and Maraston & Thomas\nmodels shows that, in general, the KFF99 models tend to\npredict younger ages and higher metallicities for any given\nposition on the grids. Also, the Mg b and Mg2 indices pre-\ndicted by the KFF99 models extend to lower values than\nthose of Maraston & Thomas, despite the fact that both\nmodels extend to [Fe\/H] \u223c \u20132.3.\nOne feature of the Maraston & Thomas models is that,\nat low metallicities, the youngest isochrones turn sharply\ndownwards, crossing over older isochrones. This is a re-\nsult of Balmer line-strengths decreasing as turn-off temper-\natures exceed Teff \u223c 9,500 K, at younger ages than where\nBalmer lines are at a maximum. The loci of the Balmer-\nline maximum shifts to older ages as metallicity decreases\n(e.g.Maraston et al. 2001).\n10 M.A. Beasley, F. Hoyle and R.M. Sharples\nAn important, but subtle difference between the evo-\nlutionary synthesis models of Maraston & Thomas and\nKFF99, and the population synthesis models of W94, is the\ntreatment of RGB stars. In the Maraston & Thomas and\nKFF99 models, mass-loss on the RGB is dealt with by us-\ning an analytical recipe (in the case of these two SSP mod-\nels, Reimers\u2019 mass-loss equation (Reimers 1975) is adopted).\nThe amount of mass-loss suffered by RGB stars plays a cru-\ncial ro\u02c6le in determining the position at which these stars fall\nonto the HB (e.g. Buzzoni 1989). Lower mass RGB stars lead\nto bluer (hotter) HBs, and increasing the \u2019mass-loss param-\neter\u2019 (\u03b7), pronounces this effect. As pointed out by Rabin\n(1982), the presence of such stars can potentially severely\neffect integrated indices, and in particular the Balmer lines.\nThe effect of this mass-loss can be seen in the Maraston\n& Thomas models, and to a lesser extent, those of KFF99.\nAt old ages (\u223c 12 Gyr), and low metallicities ([Fe\/H] \u2264 \u2013\n1.0), Balmer line-strengths begin to increase, rather than\ndecrease as expect with age, creating a saddle-point minima\nat \u223c 12 Gyr. Therefore, at old ages and low metallicities,\na unique solution for the age of a stellar population is not\nnecessarily attainable with integrated indices. The interpre-\ntation of the SSP models in this regime is further discussed\nin \u00a7 5.4, as are the effects of HB stars on our integrated\nBalmer indices in \u00a7 5.4.1.\nReturning to Figures 8 to 12, we find the agreement\nbetween the \u3008Fe\u3009, Mg b and Mg2 indices is good. In general,\nthe position of the clusters on the SSP grids using these dif-\nferent metallicity indicators are consistent within the uncer-\ntainties. The H\u03b2, H\u03b4F and H\u03b3F indices also behave similarly,\nalthough there are some indications of systematic differences\nbetween their age predictions for the younger clusters.\nThe SWB types lie in relatively tight groups on the SSP\nmodel grids. As one goes to older SWB types in Figures 8\nto 12, these groups trace a characteristic shape, moving from\nthe top-left (young ages, [Fe\/H] >\u223c \u20131.0), to centre-right (in-\ntermediate ages, [Fe\/H] >\u223c \u20131.0), to bottom-left (old ages,\n[Fe\/H] < \u20131.0). One cluster in Figure 12 clearly stands out\nas being significantly younger than the other SWB VII clus-\nters, and provides a nice illustration of the advantage of\nintegrated spectroscopy over photometry in separating age\nand metallicity effects. This cluster, NGC 1865, has an SSP-\nderived age of < 1.0 Gyr, rather than the \u223c 10 Gyr implied\nby its SWB type. Geisler et al. (1997) obtained an age of 0.9\nGyr for this cluster from the position of its CMD turnoff,\nwhich is consistent with our value. Geisler et al. (1997) at-\ntributed its SWB mis-classification to a combination of the\nstochastic effects of bright stars in the cluster, and its rela-\ntive faintness contrasted with a dense stellar background.\n5.2 Measuring Metallicities and Ages\nAs our principle metallicity indicators we have chosen our\nbest-measured magnesium dominant Lick index (Mg2), and\nmean of two iron indices (Fe5270 and Fe5335) in the form\nof \u3008Fe\u3009. As age-sensitive indices, we use H\u03b2 (Maraston\n& Thomas and KFF99 models), in addition to our best-\nmeasured higher-order Balmer lines H\u03b3F and H\u03b4F (Maraston\n& Thomas models only).\nAges and metallicities are obtained for each cluster by\ninterpolating the model grids using a fortran programme.\nWhere clusters lie off the grids, linear extrapolation is used.\nUncertainties are derived by perturbing the line-strength in-\ndices by their corresponding measurement error. Because of\nthe non-orthogonal nature of the model grids, two differ-\ning uncertainties in age and two differing uncertainties in\nmetallicity are obtained. As discussed previously, due to the\neffects of the HB on the Balmer indices, the metal-poor, old\nregions models often have two age solutions for the SWB\nVII clusters. In these cases, we adopt the prior that these\nclusters are Galactic GC analogues, and adopt the older ages\nif the clusters are consistent with these old isochrones (see\n\u00a7 5.4 for futher explanation.)\nWhilst we wish to compare the SSP model predictions\nto independently derived ages and metallicities, an important\nfeature of the SSP models should be emphasised. Due to the\nnon-orthogonality of the SSP grids, changes in the metallic-\nity estimates of the clusters effect the derived ages of the\nclusters and vice versa \u2013 i.e. there is still an age-metallicity\ndegeneracy. As a direct result of this, the KFF99 models,\nwhich have a tendency to systematically over-predict metal-\nlicities with respect to the Maraston & Thomas models (see\n\u00a7 5.1), systematically under-predict the cluster ages with re-\nspect to the Maraston & Thomas models.\nThis is illustrated in Figure 13, where we compare the\nage and metallicity predictions of the Maraston & Thomas\nand KFF99 models using two different metallicity indicators\n(\u3008Fe\u3009, Mg2) and the more age-sensitive H\u03b2. The effect can\nbe most clearly seen in the \u3008Fe\u3009\u2013H\u03b2 plane of the models. The\nKFF99-derived metallicities are systematically 0.2\u20130.5 dex\nhigher than the Maraston & Thomas-derived metallicities.\nThis leads to cluster ages which are significantly younger in\nthe KFF99 models (up to 6 Gyr for old ages) than those of\nMaraston & Thomas. However, surprisingly, the agreement\nbetween models for the ages of the youngest clusters is much\nbetter, even though the agreement between their metallic-\nities is poorest. The origin of these differences are unclear,\nsince both the models use the same fitting-functions, but a\npossible explanation may lie in their adoption of different\ninput isochrones.\nOf final, important note in Figure 13, there is a clear off-\nset in metallicity between the \u3008Fe\u3009- and Mg2-derived metal-\nlicities, in the sense that the Mg2 index predicts metallicities\n0.1 \u223c 0.5 dex higher than \u3008Fe\u3009. However, we find no evidence\nof a significant systematic offset between our measured mag-\nnesium and iron indices. As we showed in Section 4, we were\nable to correct both these indices onto the Lick\/IDS system.\nAn alternative explanation is that the \u3008Fe\u3009 and Mg2\nindices do not track metallicity in the same manner; the\n[Fe\/H] measurements of the clusters are systematically lower\nthan our [Mg\/H] measurements. Such \u201d\u03b1-enhancement\u201d has\nbeen seen in the integrated spectra of elliptical galaxies (e.g.\nPeletier 1989; Gonza\u00b4lez 1993; Kuntschner et al. 2001; Trager\net al. 2000a) and recently in extragalactic globular clus-\nters (e.g. Forbes et al. 2001, Larsen et al. 2002). Moreover,\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy of LMC clusters giants suggests\nthat, from [O\/H] ratios, this is also the case for LMC clusters\n(Hill et al. 2000). However, such an interpretation is compli-\ncated by the fact that, at low metallicities, the differences\nbetween solar-scaled and \u03b1-enhanced SSP models are small\n(i.e. little dynamic range, e.g.Milone, Barbuy, & Schiavon\n2000). A detailed analysis of this important issue is beyond\nthe scope of this paper, and we defer further discussion to\nfuture work.\nTesting Stellar Population Models with Star Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud 11\nFigure 8.

Age-metallicity diagnostic diagrams for the SWB VII clusters.\nIn Table B1, we list the age and metallicity predic-\ntions of the Maraston & Thomas SSP models, using the\nMg2-H\u03b2 and \u3008Fe\u3009-H\u03b3F indices\u2016. To test these model pre-\ndictions, we have collected age and metallicity estimates for\nthe LMC clusters in our sample from the literature. These\nare also presented in Table B1. These literature ages and\nmetallicities come from a variety sources and are therefore\nrather inhomogenous. Where possible, we have tried to min-\nimise this inhomogeneity whilst retaining a large enough\nsample for meaningful comparisons. Cluster ages are pref-\nerentially taken from studies which have located the main\nsequence turn-off in CMDs. These have been supplemented\nwith ages obtained by the giant-branch calibration of Mould\n& Aaronson (1982). For the seven clusters with no previous\nspectroscopic- and\/or CMD-derived age determinations, we\nhave adopted a mean age which corresponds to their SWB\ntype (see Table 7). We assign uncertainties by taking the 50\npercentiles in their SWB age-range.\nThe majority of the literature cluster metallicities come\nfrom the \u223c 2 A\u02da resolution Ca-triplet spectroscopy of clus-\nter red giants by Olszewski et al. (1991). For clusters not\nin the Olszewski et al. (1991) sample, we adopt metallici-\nties from integrated spectroscopy (Rabin 1982; Dutra et al.\n1999). Ages and metallicities for NGC 1806 are from the\nStro\u00a8mgren photometry of Dirsch et al. (2000).\nThe LMC globular clusters NGC 1754, NGC 1835,\nNGC 1898, NGC 2005 and NGC 2019 have metallicities\nfrom two sources. Olsen et al.

These clusters are also included in the\nOlszewski et al. (1991) sample, and therefore have spectro-\nscopic abundances. In the mean, the metallicities derived\nby Olszewski et al. (1991) are \u223c 0.3 dex lower than those\nfound by Olsen et al. (1998) using the V TOHB method. To in-\ncrease the homogeneity in our metallicity comparisons, and\nbecause we prefer spectroscopic metallicities, we adopt the\nvalues of Olszewski et al. (1991), and the ages derived by\nOlsen et al. (1998) using these metallicities. NGC 1916 was\nalso in the Olsen et al. (1998) sample, however differential\nreddening precluded an age determination for this cluster.\n5.3 Metallicity Comparisons\nWe compare the metallicities of the LMC clusters derived\nfrom the various combinations of metallicity-sensitive and\nage-sensitive indices (using the Maraston & Thomas and\nKFF99 models) with their literature values in Figure 14. To\nfirst order, the agreement between the literature values and\nthe metallicities from the \u3008Fe\u3009 and Mg2 indicators is sat-\nisfactory. Our mean metallicity uncertainty is \u223c 0.20 dex\nfor Mg2\u2013H\u03b2 and \u223c 0.25 dex for \u3008Fe\u3009\u2013H\u03b2, generally consis-\ntent with the scatter seen in Figure 14. For the higher-order\nBalmer lines, the mean uncertainty increases to \u223c 0.3 dex\ndue to the larger degree of age-metallicity degeneracy in the\nmodels for these indices.\nThere is broad agreement between different index-index\ncombinations, as there is reasonable consistency between the\nMaraston & Thomas and KFF99 model metallicity predic-\ntions (for H\u03b2). The well documented metallicity-gap (and\n14 M.A. Beasley, F. Hoyle and R.M. Sharples\nFigure 13. Comparison between the age and metallicity predictions of the Maraston & Thomas and KFF99 SSP models for the \u3008Fe\u3009,\nMg2 and H\u03b2 Lick\/IDS indices. Solid line represents unit slope.\nthe corresponding age gap) of the LMC clusters is evident\nat [Fe\/H] \u223c \u20131.0 (e.g.Westerlund 1997).\nHowever, closer inspection of Figure 14 reveals some\ninteresting differences between the SSP-derived and litera-\nture metallicities. The most obvious difference is that again,\nthe Mg2 index predicts higher metallicities than \u3008Fe\u3009. As\ndiscussed in the previous Section, in the absence of any ob-\nvious systematic errors in our data, a possible explanation\nis the detection of \u03b1-enhancement in the LMC clusters.\nAnother discrepancy is that the low-metallicity clus-\nters generally exhibit a systematic deviation from unit slope.\nRather than showing a straight offset from the literature val-\nues, these clusters metallicities are actually better fit with\na non-linear function. This behaviour is also seen to greater\nor lesser extents in all the other indices and in the both the\nKFF99 and Maraston & Thomas models.\nCan the origin of these differences lie in the different\nmetallicity scales of the literature LMC clusters, and the\nSSP models? The source of the majority of our literature\ncluster metallicities come from the study of Olszewski et al.\n(1991). Olszewski et al. (1991) calibrated their Ca-triplet\nmeasurements with Galactic GCs using metallicities on the\nZinn & West (1984) and Zinn (1985; hereafter the ZW scale)\nscale. However, Carretta & Gratton (1997) have shown that,\nwhilst the ZW scale is reassuringly monotonic, it is non-\nlinear with respect to the solar (meteoritic) scale upon which\nthe SSP model input isochrones are based. In the range \u2013\n1.9 \u2264 [Fe\/H] \u2264 \u20131.0, the ZW scale predicts metallicities\n\u223c 0.2 dex lower than the meteoritic values. For metallicities\noutside this range, the ZW scale yields values systematically\nhigher than the meteoritic scale.\nThe relation between these two scales is illustrated in\nFigure 14 by the dashed line. The x-axis may be regarded\nas the ZW scale (largely Olszewski et al. metallicities), the\ny-axis that of Carretta & Gratton (1997) (the SSP mod-\nels). We find that, for the \u3008Fe\u3009 metallicity indicator, better\nagreement is generally reached using the Carretta & Grat-\nton (1997) scale, including the flattening in their relation\nat [Fe\/H] \u223c \u20130.5. This is perhaps not surprising since Car-\nretta & Gratton (1997) derived metallicities from resolved\nFe I lines, whilst \u3008Fe\u3009 essentially measures features (iron\nand others) in the same wavelength range but at signifi-\ncantly lower resolution. However, the metallicities derived\nusing Mg2 are not so well reconciled, particularly with re-\ngard to the highest-metallicity clusters which actually follow\na one to one correlation (unit slope) somewhat more closely.\nThe question of which metallicity scale is to be preferred is\nstill an open one (e.g. see Caputo & Cassisi 2002).\nTo summarise, we find good agreement between the SSP\nmodel and literature determinations for the metallicities of\nthe LMC clusters in the range \u20132.0 \u2264 [Fe\/H] \u2264 0. System-\natic offsets between the metallicities predicted by \u3008Fe\u3009 and\nMg2 are possibly due to non-solar abundance ratios in the\nLMC clusters. Differences in the metallicity scales (from the\nline-blanketing indices of ZW, and Fe I scale of Carretta &\nGratton 1997) are at most a second-order effect.\nOf the 24 LMC clusters in our sample, 11 have no pre-\nvious metallicity determinations. The weighted mean of the\ntwo values given in Table B1 should yield a good mean\nmetallicity for these clusters.\nTesting Stellar Population Models with Star Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud 15\nFigure 14.

The presence of clear correlations in\nthe figure are reassuring. Each of the Balmer indices shown\nin Figure 15 are, to first order at least, tracking the tem-\nperature of the main sequence turn-off in the clusters, and\nthereby providing a measure of cluster age.\nWe find that the best agreement is obtained for the\nintermediate-aged clusters (i.e. 1 \u223c 4 Gyr). The H\u03b2 index\nyields ages which are in excellent agreement with their CMD\nvalues, for both the iron and magnesium metallicity indica-\ntors. H\u03b3F and H\u03b4F also predict ages which are generally con-\nsistent with the literature, although with somewhat larger\nscatter.\nIn the metallicity\u2013H\u03b2 planes of both models, the\nyoungest clusters (< 1 Gyr) are predicted to be older (by\n16 M.A. Beasley, F. Hoyle and R.M. Sharples\nFigure 15. Comparison between literature ages of the LMC clusters, and those derived from the SSP models of Maraston & Thomas\nand KFF99.

The solid line represents unit slope.\n0.2 \u2013 1.0 Gyr) than the literature ages. These H\u03b2 ages are\nalso older than is predicted by the higher-order Balmer lines.\nWhilst this is only a 1\u20132\u03c3 effect for any individual cluster, it\nis systematic. In the absence of systematic errors in the lit-\nerature ages of these clusters (in the sense that the literature\nages are too young), the source of this disagreement is either\n(i) emission fill-in of the clusters\u2019 H\u03b2 lines or (ii) an uncer-\ntainty in the SSP models at young ages. Since we detect no\nemission in these clusters\u2019 sky spectra, we conclude that, if\npresent, any emission must be arising from some internal\nsource. This would be plausible if these clusters were very\nyoung (i.e.< 107 yr) and massive O\/B stars were present.\nHowever, this is not only inconsistent with their integrated\ncolours, but also the spectra of these clusters do not show\nthe characteristic blue continua of very young objects.\nThere is some evidence that the SSP models at these\nyoung ages may be at fault (for H\u03b2). The disagreement in\nthe cluster ages occurs at < 3 Gyr, coincident with were the\nSSP models are most uncertain due to the necessary extrap-\nolation required in the Lick\/IDS fitting-functions. Moreover,\nTesting Stellar Population Models with Star Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud 17\nFigure 16.

Dotted grey lines indicate isochrones of 5\u20139 Gyr, solid\ngrey lines are isochrones of 10\u201314 Gyr. The solid black line indi-\ncates the position of the oldest (15 Gyr) isochrone of the models.\nDashed line indicates an interpolated line of constant metallicity\nat [Fe\/H]=\u20131.22.\nthe young, metal-poor regions of the SSP grids are precisely\nthe areas of parameter space which are inadequately covered\nby the spectral libraries input into the models. Clearly, this\nissue needs to be investigated futher with a larger sample of\nintegrated spectra for Magellanic Cloud clusters in this age\nrange.\nWe now turn to the SSP age predictions of the LMC\nglobular clusters (SWB VII) in our sample. At this stage, the\nmethod by which we interpret the ages of the \u2019old\u2019 clusters\nusing the SSP model grids should be discussed.\nIn Figure 16 we show the SWB VII clusters (excluding\nNGC 1865 which we earlier showed to be \u223c 1.0 Gyr old)\nin the Mg2\u2013Balmer line planes of the Maraston & Thomas\nmodels. It can be seen immediately from Figure 16 that the\nisochrones of the oldest ages overlap with those of younger\nisochrones at low metallicities. Whilst this is only a weak\neffect in the models for H\u03b2, for H\u03b3F and H\u03b4F the effect is\nsignificant. The oldest (15 Gyr) isochrone of the Maraston &\nThomas models predicts higher-order Balmer line-strengths\nvery similar to those of the 5 Gyr isochrone.\nOur prior is such that the SWB VII clusters shown in\nFigure 16 are the LMC counterparts of Galactic GCs, and as\nsuch have ages in excess of 10 Gyr. Therefore, in interpret-\ning the figure, the older isochrones (> 10 Gyr) are adopted.\nThese are the cluster ages listed in Table B1, and shown\nin Figure 15. Any clusters which lie above the oldest (15\nGyr) isochrone of the models are assigned an extrapolated\nage (i.e.> 15 Gyr) only if their line-strengths are consistent\n(1\u03c3 uncertainty) with this oldest isochrone (solid line in Fig-\nure 16). Otherwise, SWB VII clusters with strong Balmer-\nabsorption are given younger \u2019spectroscopic\u2019 ages.\nThe age predictions of the SSP models for the LMC\nglobular clusters (Figure 15) show significant variations, de-\npending upon the combination of Lick\/IDS indices used. In\ncontrast, the literature ages of the clusters (5 from the HST\nCMDs of Olsen et al. (1998), 1 from the ground-based CMD\nof Geisler et al. (1997) and 2 inferred from their SWB type)\nshow a reasonably tight age-range, from 10 to 17 Gyr. These\nages are in reasonable agreement with the \u2019best\u2019 value for\nthe Milky Way GCs of 12.9 \u00b1 2.9 Gyr (Carretta et al. 2000).\nWe find that the higher-order Balmer lines, H\u03b3F and\nH\u03b4F, are generally consistent with the CMD turn-off ages\nand\/or integrated colours. However, H\u03b2, the most age-\nsensitive of the Lick\/IDS indices (Worthey & Ottaviani\n1997) predicts a couple of clusters to be significantly younger\nthan is indicated by their literature values. Specifically, the\ntwo clusters, NGC 1754 and NGC 2005, have SSP model\nages which are inconsistent with the literature at 3\u03c3 signifi-\ncance. Both of these clusters have well-developed blue HBs,\nand their influence upon the integrated Balmer indices we\nexamine shortly.\nAs shown in Figure 16, we also find that the position\nof NGC 1786 stands out in the H\u03b3F and H\u03b4F planes of the\nSSP models. However, these indices of this cluster only fall\nbelow the Maraston & Thomas model isochrones at the \u223c\n2\u03c3 level, and therefore we do not ascribe them any particular\nsignificance.\n5.4.1 The Effect of Horizontal Branch Stars on Integrated\nBalmer Indices\nIn the previous section, we found two GCs, NGC 1754 and\nNGC 2005, have SSP-derived ages significantly (3\u03c3) younger\nthan the literature values. Rabin (1982) was the first to sug-\ngest that the presence of blue HB stars may have a signifi-\ncant effect upon the equivalent width of the Balmer indices,\npossibly comparable to the contribution from stars at the\nmain sequence turn-off. Since NGC 2005 has a largely blue\nHB, is it possible that the presence of blue HB stars are the\norigin of this present disagreement with the SSP models?\nLooking at this issue, de Freitas Pacheco & Barbuy (1995)\ncompared the H\u03b2 line-strengths of 10 Galactic GCs with\ntheir HB morphologies. With the aid of empirical modelling,\nthese authors suggested that Blue HBs may increase H\u03b2 by\nupwards of \u223c 1.0 A\u02da.\nFor the five clusters in our sample with HST CMDs from\nOlsen et al. (1998), we have an accurate measure of their\nCMD age, HB morphology and integrated Balmer indices.\nSince these clusters (NGC 1754, NGC 1835, NGC 1898,\nNGC 2005 and NGC 2019) all have similar mean spec-\ntroscopic metallicities (mean metallicities derived from Ta-\nble B1 are [Fe\/H] = \u20131.38, \u20131.57, \u20131.30, \u20131.43 and \u20131.42\nrespectively), we are able to directly compare the effect of\nHB morphology upon the Lick\/IDS Balmer indices of the\nLMC clusters.\nWe plot the Lick\/IDS Balmer indices of these GCs\nagainst their respective HB parameters in Figure 17. The\nHB parameter (e.g. Lee, Demarque, & Zinn 1994) is com-\n18 M.A. Beasley, F. Hoyle and R.M. Sharples\nFigure 17. Balmer line-strength plotted against the HB param-\neter (B \u2212 R)\/(B + V + R) of five LMC globular clusters. Filled\ntriangle : NGC 1754, filled pentagon : NGC 1835, filled hexagon\n: NGC 1898, open pentagon : NGC 2005 and open hexagon :\nNGC 2019.\nmonly given by (B\u2212R)\/(B+ V +R), where B is the num-\nber of HB stars to the blue of the instability strip, V the\nnumber of RR Lyrae stars and R the number of HB stars\nredward of the instability strip. Negative values of this pa-\nrameter indicate a red HB morphology (\u20131 corresponds to\nno blue HB stars), increasingly positive numbers correspond\nto progressively bluer HBs.\nAs shown in Figure 17, there is a correlation between\nHB parameter and Balmer line-strength, in the sense that\nbluer HBs lead to larger index values for H\u03b2, H\u03b3F and H\u03b4F.\nNGC 1898, which has a roughly equal number of stars to\nthe left and right of its RR Lyrae variables (and has the\nreddest determined HB morphology in our sample), has H\u03b2\nline-strengths \u223c 1 A\u02da lower than that of NGC 2005, a cluster\nwhich has a blue HB.\nIf we temporarily ignore the possible contribution from\nHB stars, at a given metallicity, a change in \u223c 1 A\u02da in H\u03b2\nwould be interpreted as an age difference of > 10 Gyr using\nthe (extrapolated) W94 models. Since Olsen et al. (1998)\nobtained a CMD age for NGC 1898 of 14.0 \u00b1 2.3 Gyr, and\nfor NGC 2005 of 16.6 \u00b1 5.1 Gyr (assuming Olszewski et al.\n1991 abundances), the possibility of a 10 Gyr age difference\nbetween these two clusters seems unlikely.\nOne possible origin of this behaviour of the Balmer lines\nis the metallicity dependence of the integrated indices them-\nselves. We found in this study that the metallicities of the\nclusters in Figure 17 are very similar. This is also true of the\nmetallicities derived by Olsen et al. (1998) for these same\nclusters, using the V TOHB method of Sarajedini (1994). How-\never, Olszewski et al. (1991) found from their Ca-Triplet\nobservations that NGC 2005 was some \u223c \u20130.5 dex more\nmetal-poor than NGC 1898. Since the Lick\/IDS H\u03b2 index is\nreally a blend of many metallic lines, centred on the H\u03b2 fea-\nture, significant metallicity differences amongst the clusters\nmay be driving variations in this index.\nTo test this possibility, we have used the W94 SSP mod-\nels which do not account for variations in HB morphology,\nbut treat HB stars purely as a red clump. The predictions\nof these models are qualitatively very similar to SSP models\nwith no HB stars (e.g.W94; Lee, Yoon, & Lee 2000). The\nW94 models predict that H\u03b2 increases very slowly with de-\ncreasing metallicity at old ages. At 17 Gyr, they indicate\nthat H\u03b2 increases by +0.12 A\u02da from [Fe\/H] = \u20131.5 to [Fe\/H]\n= \u20132.0. Moreover, this increase in H\u03b2 becomes only slightly\nlarger for younger ages, +0.17 A\u02da at 12 Gyr and + 0.27 A\u02da at\n8 Gyr. Therefore, even if NGC 2005 is \u20130.5 dex more metal-\npoor than NGC 1898, the metallicity sensitivity of Balmer\nlines themselves cannot explain the position of the GCs in\nFigure 17.\nWe conclude that the Balmer-line indices of the LMC\nGCs are significantly effected (increased by up to \u223c 1.0 A\u02da\nin H\u03b2) by the presence of blue HB stars. The Maraston &\nThomas (2000) and KFF99 models try to account for this\ndependency of HB morphology on metallicity, and its subse-\nquent contribution to the Balmer lines, by including mass-\nloss of the RGB. However, a shift of \u20130.5 dex in the Maraston\n& Thomas models corresponds to an increase in H\u03b2 of only\n\u223c 0.5 A\u02da at old ages and low metallicities, inconsistent with\nthe ages of NGC 1754 and NGC 2005.\nThis, however, is no real fault of the models; HB mor-\nphology cannot not be directly predicted from first principles\nin stellar evolution. The unknown mechanisms for mass-loss\nmust be subsumed within an analytical expression such as\nReimer\u2019s formalism (among others) which has little physi-\ncal basis. Moreover, the HB morphologies of GCs are not a\nmonotonic function of metallicity, and require at least one\nmore parameter to describe their morphology. This \u201csecond\nparameter effect\u201d is thought to be age, although the issue is\nfar from settled (e.g. Lee, Demarque, & Zinn 1994). There-\nfore, since SSP models cannot directly predict HB morpholo-\ngies, they must be calibrated from observations of real GCs\n(e.g. Lee, Yoon, & Lee 2000).\nFinally, we note that in the HST CMD for NGC 1898\nfrom Olsen et al. (1998), there are a number of stars which\nlie in the location on the CMD consistent with blue strag-\ngler stars (i.e.V \u2212 I \u223c 0.2, V \u223c 21). Whilst Olsen et al.\n(1998) make no such claim, due to uncertainties in their\nCMD-cleaning procedure, the possibility that they are blue\nstragglers is intriguing. The location of this cluster on the\nSSP grids suggests that if these are indeed blue straggler\nstars, they do not contribute significantly the Balmer in-\ndices of NGC 1898 (e.g. see Burstein et al. 1984 and Trager\net al. 2000b).\nA more detailed comparative study of the blue straggler\npopulation, and their effects on integrated indices, should be\nperformed between Galactic (or otherwise) GCs with very\nsimilar metallicities, ages and HB morphologies.\n6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have obtained high S\/N integrated spectra for 24 star\nclusters in the LMC, and derived age and metallicity esti-\nmates for these clusters using a combination of the Lick\/IDS\nTesting Stellar Population Models with Star Clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud 19\nindices and the SSP models of Maraston & Thomas (2000)\nand Kurth, Fritze-v. Alvensleben, & Fricke (1999). To test\nthe SSP models, we have compiled a list of metallicity and\nage determinations from the literature. Metallicities were\ntaken largely from the Ca-Triplet spectroscopy of Olszewski\net al. (1991). The age estimates are somewhat more inho-\nmogeneous in nature, deriving from a number of methods;\nthe location of the main-sequence turn-off in CMDs, the ex-\ntent of the AGB calibration of Mould & Aaronson (1982) or\nintegrated colours. Comparing these independently derived\nquantities we find:\n\u2022 the SSP-derived metallicities, obtained using both the\nMg2 and \u3008Fe\u3009 Lick\/IDS indices show generally good agree-\nment with the literature values. However, the Mg2 index\n(and to a lesser degree Mg b) predicts metallicities which\nare systematically higher than those from \u3008Fe\u3009, by up to\n+0.5 dex for the highest metallicity clusters. Amongst the\npossible explanations for this difference is the existence of\n[\u03b1\/Fe] > 0 in the clusters. We publish metallicities for 11\nLMC star clusters with no previous measurements, which\nare accurate to \u223c 0.2 dex.\n\u2022 for the majority of the LMC clusters, the SSP-models\npredict ages from the H\u03b2, H\u03b3F and H\u03b4F indices which are\nconsistent with the literature values. However, age esti-\nmates of the old LMC globular clusters are often ambiguous.\nThe oldest isochrones of the SSP models overlap younger\nisochrones due to the modelling of mass-loss on the RGB.\nAssuming old ages in interpreting these data, six clusters,\nNGC 1786, NGC 1835, NGC 1898, NGC 1916, NGC 1939\nand NGC 2019, have SSP-derived ages in all three mea-\nsurable Balmer indices which are consistent with their ages\nderived from CMDS or integrated colours.\n\u2022 two clusters, namely NGC 1754 and NGC 2005, have\nextremely strong Balmer lines, which leads to the SSP model\nages which are too young (\u223c 8 and 6 Gyr respectively).\nComparison between the horizontal branch morphology and\nthe Balmer lines for five of the GCs in our sample suggests\nthat blue HBs are likely contributing up to \u223c 1.0 A\u02da to the\nH\u03b2 index in these clusters.\nWe conclude that the SSP models considered in this\nstudy are able to satisfactorily predict the ages and metal-\nlicities for the vast majority of LMC star clusters from in-\ntegrated spectroscopic indices. This remains true despite\nthe rather inhomogenous nature of the literature age de-\nterminations. However, estimating the ages of the old, low-\nmetallicity LMC GCs is severely complicated by the strong\ncontribution of horizontal branch\/post-horizontal branch\nstars to integrated indices. We conclude that at old ages and\nlow metallicities ([Fe\/H] < \u20131.0), Balmer lines (e.g. H\u03b2, H\u03b3,\nH\u03b4) are not useful age indicators without a priori knowledge\nof horizontal branch morphology.\n7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe wish to thank Hyun-chul Lee for useful comments re-\ngarding this paper, Mike Reid for the preparation of UKST\nfinding charts, and Malcolm Hartley, who went above and\nbeyond the call of duty during the FLAIR observations.
