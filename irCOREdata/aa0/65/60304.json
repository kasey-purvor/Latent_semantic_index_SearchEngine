Introduction\nMore than a decade of precise satellite altimeter measurements has produced long time series\nof sea level h, over most of the global ocean. As a way of representing the different variations\nseen in different regions, it is common to plot the root-mean-square deviation of sea level from\nits mean, \u03c3(h), or the geostrophic eddy kinetic energy (EKE), large values of which tend to be\nassociated with strong, eddying currents. More recently, Thompson and Demirov (2006) noted\nthat there is further interesting information in the skewness S (h) of the sea level distribution,\nIAccepted for publication in Ocean Modelling. doi: 10.1016\/j.ocemod.2009.10.004\nEmail address: cwh@pol.ac.uk (Chris W. Hughes)\nPreprint submitted to Ocean Modelling October 26, 2009\nwhich tends to be positive on the poleward side of strong eastward currents, and negative on the\nequatorward side. They interpreted this as indicative of the intermittent passage of warm core\neddies or warm meanders across points poleward of a jet, and of cold core eddies or meanders\non the equatorward side.\nThis prompts the question of whether higher moments of variability contain further informa-\ntion, and how those moments might be interpreted. More generally, what is the spatial variation\nin the PDF of sea level, and what causes that variation? In considering this quesion, we found\nthat sea level, being a non-local variable from a dynamical point of view, is sometimes more\ndifficult to interpret than the more localized relative vorticity, so in much of the work presented\nhere we focus on the PDF of relative vorticity \u03b6.\nWe show below that, in fact, maps of skewness S and kurtosis K contain most of the informa-\ntion which can be reliably extracted from PDFs at each position. These are defined as\nS (x) =\n1\nn\n\u2211\nn x\n3(\n1\nn\n\u2211\nn x\n2\n)3\/2 , (1)\nK(x) =\n1\nn\n\u2211\nn x\n4(\n1\nn\n\u2211\nn x\n2\n)2 , (2)\nwhere x is the deviation of some quantity from its mean value. Skewness is a measure of asym-\nmetry of the PDF. Where rare, large events predominantly have one sign, this is the sign of the\nskewness; a Gaussian distribution is symmetric and therefore has a skewness of zero. Kurtosis\nis traditionally described as a measure of \u201cpeakiness\u201d of the PDF. High kurtosis means that rare,\nlarge amplitude events occur more frequently than would be expected for a Gaussian distribu-\ntion, producing a more sharply peaked PDF with broader tails than a Gaussian. Low kurtosis\nmeans that events much larger than typical are rarer than would be expected from a Gaussian\ndistribution, and the associated PDF tends to be flat near its peak, or even bimodal, and drops to\nsmall values faster than a Gaussian. The smallest possible kurtosis is 1, and this results from a\nvariable taking only two possible values, with equal probability. A Gaussian distribution leads\nto a kurtosis of 3. For this reason, the quantity K \u2212 3 is often used, sometimes termed \u201cexcess\nkurtosis\u201d and sometimes simply \u201ckurtosis\u201d. We will use the definition given above and, when 3\nis subtracted, this will be stated explicitly.\nOur dataset consists of the AVISO gridded sea level anomaly (corrected for tides and inverse\nbarometer effect) supplied weekly on a 1\/3 degree Mercator grid. While the grid is 1\/3 degree,\nthe spacing between altimeter tracks is 0.72 degrees of longitude for ERS\/Envisat, and 2.78\ndegrees for Topex or Jason, so we should not expect to resolve all features less than about 100\nkm across. We use the \u201creference\u201d version of the data in which sampling is always from two\naltimeters (Topex\/Poseidon or Jason 1 and ERS or Envisat) in the same two orbits, and consider\n690 weeks spanning the period 5 April 1995 to 11th June 2008 which follows the period when\nERS-1 was not in the standard 35-day repeat orbit. Geostrophic relative vorticity anomalies are\ncalculated by first-order centered differencing of the sea level to give geostrophic velocity, and\nthe same form of differencing to then give vorticity at the same grid points as the sea level data.\nThese are divided by the local Coriolis parameter f so that positive values represent cyclonic,\nand negative values anticyclonic, relative vorticity.\nAs we are interested in the shape of the PDFs rather than their widths, we consider only time\nseries which have had their means removed and have been divided by their standard deviations.\n2\nIn fact, we also subtract an annual and semiannual cycle and a linear trend, simultaneously fit\nto each time series. It is also worth noting a limitation of the geostrophic relative vorticity\ncalculation. The effect of nonlinear terms in the momentum equation is such that the geostrophic\nvelocity (and hence vorticity) is an underestimate in cyclonic vortices, and an overestimate in\nanticyclonic vortices. This potential bias should be kept in mind, although it is not particularly\nimportant for the main issue we consider here, which focuses on the step-like structure in jets.\nBinning the resulting normalized PDFs from each grid point into bins 0.01 standard deviations\nwide, and averaging over the globe (excluding the band within 5 degrees of the equator in the\ncase of vorticity, to avoid the equatorial singularity), produces the average PDFs shown on both\nlogarithmic and linear scales in Figure 1. The dashed lines show the corresponding Gaussian\nPDF for reference. We see that the average shape of the PDF for both sea level and relative\nvorticity is fairly close to Gaussian, but significantly above Gaussian in the wings and centre of\nthe distribution (and below Gaussian in between). Gille and Sura (2009) look at the overall global\nrelationship between skewness and kurtosis seen from such PDFs, and similar characterization\nof the velocity PDFs from altimetry has been investigated by Schorghofer and Gille (2002) and\nGille and Llewellyn-Smith (2000). This average shape, however, conceals a large geographic\nvariation. Characterization of this spatial variability is the subject of the next section.\n2. Spatial variations of the PDFs\nSkewness and kurtosis are the first two in an infinite series of moments which characterize the\nshape of the PDF, following the mean and standard deviation which characterize its position and\nwidth. However, it is not immediately clear that these are the parameters best suited to describing\nthe spatial variations in shape. Furthermore, as kurtosis is particularly sensitive to rogue large\nvalues in a dataset (it is sometimes used as an indicator of bad data), it is quite possible for\nmuch of the shape of the PDF to be invisible to the kurtosis in cases where one particularly large\nvalue occurs. For this reason, we seek to characterize the typical variations in shape of the PDF,\nignoring the very extreme wings of the distribution.\nTo do this, we use empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. This is often used to calculate\nspatial patterns associated with the principal modes of variability of time series given at each\ngrid point. Here, instead of time, we are using the x-axis of the normalized PDF graph at each\ngrid point. Rather than calculate EOFs of the complete PDF, we choose first to subtract the\nGaussian PDF so that we will clearly be mapping departures from Gaussian behaviour. We\nobtain a set of orthonormal eigenvectors, the first of which explains the largest possible amount of\nspatial variability in the PDF, the second of which describes as much as possible of the remaining\nvariability after removing the effect of the first mode, and so on. The associated eigenvalues give\nthe amount of variance explained by each mode.\nThere are not enough points in a time series at one point to produce a PDF with such high\nresolution as in Figure 1, so here we increase the bin size to 0.1 standard deviations, and consider\nonly the 80 points between -4 and +4 standard deviations (this avoids the inclusion of any very\nextreme values). The analysis was also repeated with a bin size of 0.4 standard deviations, and\nonly 20 points per PDF, with very similar results to those presented here.\nThe first 15 eigenvalues of the resulting EOFs are plotted in Figure 2, as percentages of the\ntotal variance (diamonds for the sea level EOFs and crosses for relative vorticity). In both cases,\nthe first two eigenvalues stand clearly above the background continuum, together explaining\n28.8% of the sea level variance and 22.7% of relative vorticity variance. In the case of sea level,\nthe second two EOFs may also plausibly be said to stand above the background. Inspection of\n3\nFigure 1: Global average, normalized PDF of (left) sea level, and (right) geostrophic relative vorticity \u03b6\/ f from gridded\naltimetry. The same data are shown on (top) logarithmic and (bottom) linear scales. In each panel, the dotted line is the\ncorresponding Gaussian PDF.\n4\nFigure 2: Eigenvalues of the first 15 EOFs of the PDFs for (diamonds) sea level and (crosses) relative vorticity. Eigenval-\nues are normalized so that they sum to 100, and each represents the percentage of variance explained by the corresponding\neigenvector.\nthe associated eigenvectors clearly shows the remaining EOFs to be associated with statistical\nnoise, representing simply the exchange of probability between neighbouring bins (using coarser\nbins reduces the amplitude of this noise, leaving the first two EOFs to account for 61.7% of\nvariance for sea level and 60.6% for relative vorticity, but does not lead to identification of any\nmore significant modes).\nSince we are interested in relating the variations in PDFs to skewness and kurtosis, it would\nbe nice if the EOFs fell naturally into symmetric and antisymmetric categories. They do not, but\nthe importance of symmetry is clear from the fact that very nearly symmetric and antisymmetric\nfunctions can be formed from the obvious pairs of EOFs. If we take the first two EOFs of sea\nlevel, we can construct from these by a rotation, two different orthonormal vectors C and D\nchosen to minimize the quantity (C + Cr)2 + (D \u2212 Dr)2, where the superscript r represents the\nreverse of the vector (i.e. the components listed in reverse order). This minimizes the sum of\nthe squares of the symmetrical component of C and the antisymmetric component of D. In other\nwords, C represents a linear combination of the first two EOFs which is close to antisymmetric,\nand D an orthogonal linear combination which is close to symmetric. The results of such a\nminimization applied to the pairs of EOFs identified from Figure 2 are shown in Figure 3. The\nsolid lines are constructed from pairs of EOFs of the sea level PDFs, and dashed lines from\nrelative vorticity. To show how closely these approximate the ideal symmetry, crosses represent\nthe exactly antisymmetric or exactly symmetric components of the corresponding sea level EOF\ncurves. Success in this minimization is not inevitable. For example, no combination of the first\nand third EOFs can produce anything like a symmetric and antisymmetric pair of functions. This\nsuccess suggests that it is meaningful to combine the EOFs in this way.\nThe projection of the PDFs onto these rotated EOFs is shown in Figures 4 and 5. The pat-\ntern of the first rotated EOF for sea level is clearly very similar to the skewness map presented\nby Thompson and Demirov (2006). Major eastward currents are delineated by the boundary\n5\nFigure 3: Rotated eigenvectors of the first 4 EOFs (solid) of the PDFs for sea level and the first 2 EOFs (dashed)\nfor relative vorticity. Crosses are half of the corresponding sea level vector plus or minus its reverse, illustrating the\ncorresponding perfectly symmetrical or antiysymmetric curves.\n6\nbetween large positive and large negative values, and preferred paths of eddies, such as in the\nAlaskan Stream along the Aleutian island chain at the northern boundary of the Pacific (Ueno et\nal., 2009), and southwest of Australia (Morrow et al., 2004) also stand out. The tropical Pacific is\nalso prominent. As Thompson and Demirov (2006) point out, this is the result of the dominance\nof the large 1997-1998 El Nin\u02dco event in the region. This highlights a disadvantage of considering\nsea level: large scale sea level signals can dominate the time series at a given point, but there may\nbe little or no associated current or other dynamical change at that point. Dynamically, sea level\nis a nonlocal variable on time scales of several days or longer. For this reason, the localization\nof physical processes is better determined using vorticity or potential vorticity. This is illustrated\nfor relative vorticity in Figure 5. The spatial pattern for the first rotated EOF is clearly related\nto that for sea level (with a sign change since a positive localized sea level anomaly represents\nan anticyclonic circulation), but the relative vorticity map shows finer scales and more localized\nstructures (particularly in the Southern Ocean) than the corresponding map based on sea level.\nUsing relative vorticity also avoids a dominant influence of the El Nin\u02dco event, making it possible\nto pick out clear structures to the west of Hawaii and Central America.\nThe projections of sea level and relative vorticity PDFs onto the second rotated EOFs bear a\nsimilar relationship to each other (without the sign change, since the second rotated EOF is close\nto symmetrical). Strong currents now stand out as low values of the projection, and these features\nare more clearly defined in the relative vorticity plot.\nFrom the forms of the EOFs, we expect the projections to be closely related to skewness and\nkurtosis respectively, and Figure 6 shows that this is the case for relative vorticity (the equivalent\nmaps for sea level skewness and kurtosis are not shown, but bear a similar relation to the sea\nlevel EOF projections). The EOF projections can be described as slightly \u201ccleaner\u201d: definition\nof some features is better, such as the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico, and features along the\nFalklands shelf. There are also some isolated spots of large skewness and kurtosis which are not\nvisible in the EOF maps, which suggests that they may be due to rogue data points (a few time\nseries which have been checked are consistent with this, consisting of a rather flat curve with\none sudden spike). A problem with the gridding in the region north of Iceland and Norway also\nshows up much more clearly in skewness and kurtosis than in the EOF maps. However, it can\ngenerally be said that maps of skewness and kurtosis are capturing the same spatial variability\nas the two EOF maps and, since only two EOFs are above the background noise for relative\nvorticity, that means that skewness and kurtosis capture all that can currently be captured about\nspatial variations in the PDF of relative vorticity. In the case of sea level, the spatial patterns\nassociated with the third and fourth rotated EOFs (not shown) appear very noisy except in the\nvicinity of the very strongest currents, suggesting that they do contain physically meaningful\ninformation, but only in these select regions.\nIt is difficult to assess the statistical noise levels on these estimates, as the weekly sea level\nmaps are not independent. A standard result estimates the standard error on skewness as\n\u221a\n6\/n,\nand that on kurtosis as\n\u221a\n24\/n, where n is the number of independent samples, although kurtosis\nhas a strongly asymmetric distribution, having a minimum value of 1, Gaussian value of 3 and\ninfinite maximum possible value for a continuous PDF. As a guide, the 5 and 95 percentiles\nfor skewness and kurtosis generated from a Gaussian distribution sampled at a finite number n\nof independent times have been calculated by Monte Carlo simulation (using 100,000 random\ninput time series) for n = 690 (the number of points in the time series), n = 300, and n = 100.\nThe results are shown in Table 1. The strongest justification for the significance of these results,\nhowever, is the spatial coherence and physical plausibility of the resulting patterns.\n7\nFigure 4: Projection of the sea level PDFs onto the first and second rotated eigenvectors from Figure 3.\n8\nFigure 5: Projection of the relative vorticity PDFs onto the first and second rotated eigenvectors from Figure 3.\n9\nFigure 6: Skewness and kurtosis of relative vorticity time series.\n10\nTable 1: Values of skewness (S ), kurtosis minus 3 (K \u2212 3) and projections of rotated EOF1 and rotated EOF2 generated\nby chance from finite samples of length n taken from Gaussian distributions.

Interpretation of low kurtosis regions\nAs stated in the introduction, the lowest possible kurtosis is 1, and occurs when the variable\n(\u03b6\/ f or h) is always at one of two values, and occupies those two values with equal probability.\nConsider a sharp jet, which may be approximated as a step in sea level. If that jet meanders, then\nsea level within the region over which it meanders will always be at one of two values (either to\nthe left, or to the right of the jet). Along some line, the jet will spend equal amounts of time to\nthe left and to the right of that line. On that line, the kurtosis of sea level would be 1.\nOff the line, the fraction of time spent in each state varies, becoming more asymmetrical\nwith distance from the centre line until beyond the limit of meanders where sea level becomes\nconstant. If the fractions of time spent at each value are A at the lower value, and B = 1\u2212A at the\nhigher value, then it is simple to calculate that K = \u22123 + 1\/P, S = (A \u2212 B)\/\u221aP, S 2 = \u22124 + 1\/P,\nwhere P = AB has a maximum possible value of 1\/4. It will be noticed that this rather extreme\nsituation gives the relationship K = S 2 + 1. This in fact represents the minimum possible K\nfor a given S (Pearson, 1916). Idealized though this model is, it does capture the main features\nsurrounding jets in Figure 6: low kurtosis and zero skewness at the centre (mean position) of\nthe jet, with kurtosis growing to large positive values on either side, as skewness grows to large\npositive values on one side and large negative values on the other side of the jet.\nThe observed values of K are, inevitably, never as low as this extreme model would predict.\nThis prompts a slightly more sophisticated model: instead of constant sea level to either side of\nthe jet, add Gaussian noise to the sea level on either side. Thus, we consider the situation in\nwhich there is a sharp step in sea level across the jet, which meanders, but there is also random\nsea level variability producing a Gaussian PDF either side of the step (for simplicity, we choose\nthe standard deviations of the Gaussians to be the same on each side of the step). The time series\nat any point is then a random variation about a certain mean at times when the point is to the\nnorth of the jet, and a random variation about a different mean at times when the point is to\nthe south of the jet. The resulting PDF consists of the sum of two Gaussian PDFs, with centres\nseparated by a distance d (the size of the step). We measure d in units of the Gaussian standard\ndeviation, so that d represents the ratio of step size to the size of the Gaussian noise. We now\ndefine A as the integral of the Gaussian centered at the lower value (i.e. the probablility of being\non the low side of the step), and B = 1\u2212 A is the integral of the second Gaussian. Again, we will\nhave A = B = 0.5 at the mean central position of the jet, with A decreasing and B increasing to\none side of that point, and the converse on the other side.\nAt the jet centre, the sum of two Gaussians with small separation would produce a PDF with\n11\na flatter centre region than a single Gaussian alone (and hence kurtosis less than 3). For larger\nseparation (d > 2) the PDF becomes bimodal, and kurtosis becomes even smaller, dropping\ntowards 1 as the separation of the Gaussians becomes larger (when the noise to either side of the\njet becomes a small fraction of the size of the step).\nFigure 7 shows the time series, and associated normalized PDF, for \u03b6\/ f at two points of par-\nticularly low kurtosis in the Gulf Stream extension and the Agulhas Return Current. In both\ncases the vorticity clearly spends about half its time in the vicinity of one value, and half its time\nclose to another value, with clusters about those two values overlapping to a degree, but clearly\nseparate. This is reflected in the bimodal PDFs.\nThe model remains simplified, but this has the advantage that it can be solved analytically\nfor skewness and kurtosis as a function of A and d. The resulting relationships (derived in the\nAppendix) are\nK \u2212 3 = d\n4P(1 \u2212 6P)\n(1 + d2P)2 , (3)\nS = d\n3P(A \u2212 B)\n(1 + d2P)3\/2 , (4)\nS 2 = d\n6P2(1 \u2212 4P)\n(1 + d2P)3 , (5)\nremembering that B = 1 \u2212 A and P = AB. At the mean position of the jet, A = B = 1\/2\ngiving a skewness of zero, and reducing (3) to K = 3 \u2212 2\/(1 + 4\/d2)2. A series of curves, each\ncorresponding to changing A at constant d (i.e. representing how skewness and kurtosis would\nvary across a jet for a particular ratio of noise to step size) is shown as the thin black curves in\nFigure 8. The different curves represent integer values of d from 1 to 6 (inner to outer), showing\nhow the distance from the Gaussian values S = 0, K = 3 increases as the step size d increases\nin comparison to the noise. To understand this plot, consider a jet with negative skewness to the\nsouth (for relative vorticity, an eastward jet in the southern hemisphere would show this pattern,\nfor sea level it would be a northern hemisphere jet). As we move from south to north, we follow\none of the curves in an anticlockwise direction. Far to the south, the noise dominates over the\ninfluence of the jet and the PDF is a single Gaussian (P = 0), producing S = 0, K = 3. As\nthe influence of sea level from the other side of the jet becomes stronger (P increases), skewness\ndecreases and kurtosis increases, reaching a maximum at P = 1\/(d2 + 12). Kurtosis then starts\nto decrease while skewness continues to decrease until it reaches a minimum at P = 2\/(d2 + 12),\nwhere K = 3 + 3S 2\/2. Kurtosis drops below 3 at P = 1\/6, decreasing to its minimum at the\ncentre of the jet where P = 1\/4, S = 0. Then kurtosis starts to rise and the curve follows the\npositive skewness branch to the right and up, returning finally to S = 0, K = 3 far to the north.\nFor small d (small step size compared to noise), the trajectories remain close to S = 0, K = 3,\nextending further from this point as d increases. In fact, allowing all values of d produces a\nfamily of curves which fill the entire allowed space K \u2265 S 2 + 1. Only for d > 2 does the PDF\nbecome bimodal at the jet centre, at which point we would then have K < 2.5, although for more\ngeneral distributions, the PDF can only be guaranteed to be bimodal if K < S 2+1.512 (Klaassen\net al, 2000)\nThere are many ways in which this model is oversimplified. Noise is the same (and Gaussian)\non either side of the jet, and the jet is still modelled as a step function. A slightly more realistic\nmodel has also been investigated numerically, modelling the jet as a(t) tanh (x \u2212 x0(t)) + b(t),\nwith Gaussian random time series for a, b, and x0. Results from this are not shown as the curves\n12\nFigure 7: Time series of relative vorticity (plotted as \u03b6\/ f ) from two points with particularly low kurtosis, from (top)\nthe Gulf Stream extension and (bottom) the Agulhas Return Current. Panels to the right show the corresponding PDF,\ncalculated by kernel density estimation using a Gaussian kernel of standard deviation 0.2.\n13\nFigure 8: The relationship between skewness and kurtosis in the vicinity of a front. Thin curves represent the relationship\nresulting from the simple model described in the text. Each curve corresponds to a particular ratio d of step size to noise\n(values d = 1 to 6 are plotted), with curves becoming larger as d increases (noise decreases). For relative vorticity, the\ncurve is followed anticlockwise when passing from poleward to equatorward of an eastward jet. Crosses are values at\npoints in the vicinity of the Agulhas Return Current. The thick line with diamonds is the trajectory described by statistics\naveraged at constant meridional distance from the centre of the current.\nproduced are very similar (though not identical) to those given by the simpler model, and do not\nseem to provide much greater insight. Two main criteria determine whether the trajectory forms\na wide loop about the point S = 0, K = 3: the jet must meander by more than its width, and the\nsea level noise either side of the jet must be smaller than the sea level step across the jet.\nWe have illustrated the actual skewness-kurtosis relationship for the Agulhas return current in\nFigure 8. The centre of the jet at each longitude between 23.3\u25e6E and 50\u25e6E was defined as the\npoint of minimum kurtosis in a narrow latitude range south of Africa. Kurtosis and skewness\nwere then regridded, shifting each longitude to the north or south so that it was centered on the\njet centre. Skewness and kurtosis at all points from 10 grid points south to 10 grid points north\nof the centre (a total range of about 4.8 degrees) are plotted in the figure as grey crosses. Then\nskewness and kurtosis were averaged at constant northward distance from the jet centre, and the\nresulting trajectory plotted as the thick line in Figure 8.\nAlthough the relationship does not lie along a particular constant d curve, it is clear that the\ntrajectory forms a fairly broad loop around S = 0, K = 3, often outside the d = 2 contour,\nand with minimum K below 2.5 consistent with the observed bimodal distribution, and with\nthe interpretation as a meandering jet. The asymmetry is interesting, suggesting that noise is\nmore significant in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) to the south of the jet, and that the\nmeanders are the more dominant signal on the northern side, in the Indian Ocean. Thus, although\nkurtosis falls below 3 only in a small region around the mean jet position, the statistics remain\nconsistent with interpretation as the effect of a meandering jet to a distance of several degrees\neither side of the jet.\nIt will not have escaped the reader\u2019s attention that the discussion has been in terms of sea\nlevel, whereas most of the illustrations are of relative vorticity. While it is clear that a jet must be\n14\nassociated with a drop in sea level, the associated vorticity pattern is not so clear, except to note\nthat, as velocity is a maximum at the jet centre (assuming an eastward jet), relative vorticity must\nbe cyclonic on the poleward side and anticyclonic on the equatorward side of the jet, and small\nfar from the jet. It is not inevitable that the strongest gradient in relative vorticity lies at the jet\ncentre.\nIn one sense, it does not matter. The arguments above apply if there is a sharp, meandering\nfront in any quantity, and the low kurtosis region can then be taken to represent the mean position\nof that front. However, there is a more concrete model which is rather appealing, which is clearest\nif we consider things in terms of potential vorticity (PV). One model of a jet, recently reviewed\nby Dritschel and McIntyre (2008, D&M hereafter, see also references therein), is as the result\nof a step in PV. In this paradigm, jets represent a barrier to the mixing of PV, so PV tends to\nbecome mixed to two different, constant values either side of a jet, with a sharp gradient across\nthe jet. In turn, inverting the PV distribution shows that such a PV staircase actually implies the\nexistence of a jet at the position of the PV step, so a positive feedback exists tending to maintain\nthis configuration. As PV is materially conserved, time series of PV in the vicinity of the jet\nwill be close to the ideal of switching between two constant values which produces the lowest\npossible kurtosis values for a given skewness.\nOur time series is, of necessity, relative vorticity rather than PV. However, if we assume we\nare in a dynamical regime in which variations of PV are dominated by vorticity rather than thick-\nness variations (or if we assume a constant relationship between thickness and relative vorticity\nchanges), then the time series of relative vorticity at a fixed point (so that f is constant) will be\nequivalent to time series of PV. In this case, we can see that the low kurtosis regions are con-\nsistent with the existence of a PV step at the jet centre. This prompts the question of whether\nkurtosis bears a relationship to the presence of mixing barriers, which will be considered in the\nnext section.\nFirst, though, we turn our attention to the many sharply-defined low kurtosis features which\nare clear in Figures 5 and 6. The Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, and Agulhas Return Current are clear,\nbut there are many other features, particularly in the Southern Ocean, which could also plausibly\nrepresent jets or frontal features. From our model, the centres of jets which meander strongly\nshould be characterized by regions where the zero contour of skewness coincides with a value\nof kurtosis less than 3. In Figure 9 we plot these contours in black, using \u03b6\/ f skewness and\nkurtosis, and insisting on a degree of spatial continuity by using a 5 by 5 grid point smoothed\nversion of the fields. The contours are superimposed on a map (top) of mean surface geostrophic\nflow speed based on the Rio05 mean dynamic topography (Rio and Hernandez, 2004). It is\nimmediately clear that the technique correctly identifies not only the major eastward-flowing\njets, but a number of weaker, mid-ocean jets in all ocean basins. There are, however, significant\ndisagreements with the Rio05 data, most notably in the Southern Ocean. Here, agreement is\ngenerally good in the northern parts of the ACC, but is less good further south, especially in\nthe eastern Pacific sector where a number of apparent jets are identified which are absent from\nRio05.\nHowever, small scale features in the Rio05 data rely for their detection primarily on the surface\ndrifter data, and these southern regions of the ACC are precisely where the density of drifter data\ndrops off. It may be that there are really jets in these regions, but they are not resolved by the mea-\nsurements available to produce the Rio05 map. In order to test this possibility, we have turned to\nsea surface temperature (SST) gradients. These are not always indicative of surface currents, but\nthe fact that the ACC is to first order an equivalent barotropic flow (Killworth, 1992; Killworth\nand Hughes, 2002) means that temperature at any depth does tend to be a good proxy for the dy-\n15\nFigure 9: Magnitude of the mean current (top) and mean sea surface temperature gradient (bottom), with black contours\nsuperimposed where the skewness\/kurtosis relationship implies the mean centre of a jet or front to lie.\n16\nnamic topography in this region (Sun and Watts 2001). In order to calculate a mean SST gradient,\nwe have used merged infra-red and microwave satellite data from the Mersea Odyssea project,\ndownloaded from ftp:\/\/ftp.ifremer.fr\/ifremer\/medspiration\/data\/l4hrsstfnd\/eurdac\/glob\/odyssea.\nThe data are provided as daily fields at 0.1 degree resolution. Over the period 1 Oct 2007 to\n12 May 2009, 451 fields were available. These were differentiated to produce temperature gradi-\nents and each field inspected by eye to check for obvious artifacts. On this basis, 30 daily fields\nwere eliminated. The remaining 421 fields of SST gradient were averaged, and regridded onto\nthe AVISO altimetry grid.\nThe resulting SST gradient plot is shown in the lower panel of Figure 9, with our putative jet\ncontours superimposed. It is clear that the Southern Ocean contours do indeed correspond with\nfrontal features which were unresolved in the Rio05 data. In order to test how robust these com-\nparisons are, we have repeated them with the Maximenko and Niiler (2005) dynamic topography,\nand with 7.25 years of SST data from the coarser-resolution AMSR-E microwave temperature\nmeasurements (Wentz and Meissner, 2004). The resulting pictures (not shown) are very similar,\nwith a little smoothing of the SST gradient, and a little less smoothing of the geostrophic flow\nspeed (at the expense of more small-scale noise).\nOne final feature worth noting is that the identified path of the Kuroshio seems to be on the\nnorthern flank of the jet itself. The same is also true if sea level is used to identify this jet\n(not shown). This may be a result of the different averaging periods used for the mean current\nand the skewness and kurtosis; preliminary calculations using different subsets of the altimeter\ndata produce more variation in results around the Kuroshio than elsewhere. Close inspection of\nthe Gulf Stream also reveals some fine scale structure in the vorticity diagnostics which are not\npresent in the sea level equivalents. It may be that, by combining the two analyses, more detailed\ninformation about the lateral structure of the jets can be extracted.\nIn summary, the pattern of a low kurtosis zone at the centre of a change in sign of skewness\nseems to be a reliable method of identifying meandering jets or frontal zones. When applied to\ntime series of relative vorticity, this has allowed us to identify several jets previously unresolved\nby drifter data. In the next section, we will consider whether these low kurtosis zones also\nrepresent mixing barriers.\n4. Does low kurtosis imply a mixing barrier?\nAs discussed above, the PV staircase model reviewed by D&M implies that jets occur at\nsteps in PV, and that they act as mixing barriers. In fact D&M make the argument that mixing\nacross a jet requires the presence of vortices with PV anomalies larger than the PV step which is\nassociated with the jet. This sounds very similar to the criterion necessary for the formation of a\nlow kurtosis region. If vortices are considered to be the \u201cnoise\u201d on either side of the jet, then low\nkurtosis at the jet centre only occurs when the noise is smaller than the step, suggesting that low\nkurtosis should qualitatively be an indicator of a mixing barrier.\nIn order to test this suggestion, we turn to a set of idealized model experiments, initially run in\norder to investigate the effect of topography on jets and mixing in a zonal channel (Thompson,\n2009). These are two-layer, quasigeostrophic simulations in a doubly-periodic channel, forced\nby an implicit zonal momentum flux which maintains a constant difference between the total\nzonal transports in the upper and lower layers. These model runs are not chosen because they are\nsupposed to model particular parts of the real ocean, but because they explore a wide range of jet\ntypes and behaviours, including intermittent jets, meridionally-drifting jets, and topographically-\n17\nsteered jets, as well as steady, zonal jets. Another reason for the model choice is that the mixing\ndiagnostics have already been performed, making it simple to compare mixing with kurtosis.\nFour model experiments are considered. Experiment 1 is a flat-bottomed channel, and pro-\nduces four, steady, eastward jets, with weaker westward flow in-between. Experiment 32 has\nsinusoidal topography as a function of latitude only, and produces a sequence of jets which form\nin regions of strong background PV gradient, but drift north or south to regions of weak PV gra-\ndient, where they decay. Experiment 84 has topography which is sinusoidal in both latitude and\nlongitude, producing a series of three strongly-steered eastward jets, with weaker westward flow\nin between. Experiment 87 has similar topography, but only one strong eastward jet, which is\nmore weakly steered and which intermittently breaks up in a bout of strong mixing. More details\nof these model runs are given in Thompson (2009). Mean and eddy kinetic energies vary by a\nfactor of more than 40 between experiments, which clearly represent a wide range of conditions\nand kinds of jet.\nFlow fields and PV kurtosis maps for the top layer are shown in Figure 10 (in the case of\nexperiment 32, this is a plot of zonally-averaged flow and kurtosis as a function of time and lat-\nitude, with kurtosis calculated using a moving window). It is clear that kurtosis is robustly low\nat the centre of the jets. For these experiments, the effective diffusivity Ke f f of upper layer PV\nwas calculated as a function of time and equivalent latitude using the methodology of Shuck-\nburgh and Haynes (2003). In order to compare across the range of experiments, it was found\nmost effective to normalize the diffusivity by the square root of the domain-averaged EKE. The\nresulting normalized diffusivities would have dimensions of length, but the experiments were all\nnon-dimensionalized using the Rossby radius Ro as the length scale, and Ro\/U for time, where\nU is the average imposed velocity difference between layer 1 and layer 2, so the normalized\ndiffusivity should be multiplied by Ro to give a dimensional value.\nThe time-averaged values of Ke f f , normalized by\n\u221a\nEKE, were compared with zonally-\naveraged values of PV kurtosis (in the case of experiments 84 and 87 the average was not zonal\nbut along mean streamlines, because the mean flow is strongly steered by topography). The re-\nsulting relationship between kurtosis and Ke f f \/\n\u221a\nEKE is plotted for all experiments in Figure\n11. There is not just a qualitative relationship between the two, at low values of diffusivity there\nappears to be a strong, universal, linear relationship. As a guide (not any kind of formal fit), the\nstraight line (Ke f f \/\n\u221a\nEKE) = (K \u2212 1.3)\/30 has been drawn, which appears to fit the distribution\nfairly well.\nFor kurtosis values significantly higher than 3, the relationship becomes looser. There is no\nreason to expect a relationship at these high K values, so this is unsurprising. The relationship\nis also significantly worse for experiment 32, which again is not surprising as the value at each\nlatitude is an average over times when there is low mixing and times when there is high mixing\nat that latitude. The surprise is that it works as well as it does, and falls on roughly the same\nrange of values as the other experiments.\nFigure 12 uses the linear scaling proposed in Figure 11 to plot normalized KE f f as a func-\ntion of latitude for each experiment, together with the value which would be predicted from the\nkurtosis (dashed lines). This shows how well kurtosis captures the structure as well as values at\nthe minima of diffusivity. There is a tendency to underestimate diffusivity where jets are drifting\n(Exp. 32) or intermittent (Exp. 87), in which case our simple model is no longer adequate, but\neven here there is a reasonable correspondence. Much better fits can be found for individual ex-\nperiments by adding quadratic terms, but that is at the expense of universality, since the quadratic\nterms differ strongly between experiments.\n18\nFigure 10: Kurtosis of upper layer PV (shaded) and upper layer streamfunction (contours) for the four model experiments\nconsidered here. Plots are time averages, except for experiment 32, which is a zonal average as a function of time, the\nkurtosis being a running average over 20 time units.\n19\nFigure 11: Scatterplot of surface layer normalized effective diffusivity against zonally-averaged kurtosis of PV\n(alongstream-averaged for experiments 84 and 87) for the four numerical experiments. The solid line represents a\nsuggested suitable linear relationship, but it is not a formal fit. Values of the normalizing constant, non-dimensional\ndomain-averaged\n\u221a\nEKE, are listed for each experiment.\n5. Conclusions and discussion\nMeandering jets in the ocean are associated with a characteristic pattern of skewness and\nkurtosis of sea level and, more clearly, relative vorticity. The mean position of the jet or front lies\nalong the zero contour of skewness, which is also a region of low (less than 3) kurtosis. This can\nbe explained using a model in which the jet or front represents a sharp step in sea level or relative\nvorticity, and meanders over a distance wider than the width of the step. We find little evidence\nthat more useful data can be extracted from the spatial variation of PDFs beyond what is apparent\nfrom skewness and kurtosis. Using this relationship we have identified several Southern Ocean\njets which were previously unresolved by drifter-based climatologies.\nThe fact that these features are seen more clearly in relative vorticity than in sea level suggests\nthe use of a model of a jet as a step in PV, between two regions of well-mixed PV, as discussed\nrecently by D&M. In this model, when the jump in PV across the step is larger than the eddy\nvariations to either side, the step acts as a mixing barrier. These are precisely the conditions in\nwhich time series of PV would exhibit low kurtosis at the mean position of the jet centre. That\nled us to ask whether low kurtosis regions were indicative of the presence of a mixing barrier.\nAcross a wide variety of idealized model experiments, we find a strong, universal, linear rela-\ntionship between PV kurtosis and effective diffusivity normalized by the square root of domain-\naveraged EKE. The relationship is particularly strong at low values of kurtosis, which represent\nthe strongest mixing barriers. This suggests that the regions of low kurtosis from the relative\nvorticity time series may indeed represent mixing barriers in the ocean.\nThere are a couple of difficulties with linking the model experiments and our interpretation to\n20\nFigure 12: The same values of normalized effective diffusivity from Figure 11, plotted as a function of effective latitudinal\ncoordinate measured in Rossby radii. The dashed line is the value which would be predicted from kurtosis of PV, using\nthe linear relationship suggested in Figure 11.\n21\nthe data. The data only tell us about relative vorticity, not PV. Variations in f are not a problem,\nas the time series are at constant latitude, but if thickness variations are not either small or simply\nrelated to relative vorticity variations, then the time series we have may not be representative\nof PV variations. The second problem is that the relationship we find is between PV kurtosis\nand a diffusivity normalized by the square root of domain-averaged EKE. In the real ocean,\nwhat would be the appropriate region over which to average? Using local EKE in the model\ndiagnostics results in significantly more scatter in the relationship, so some degree of spatial\naveraging is clearly needed, perhaps over an eddy Rhines scale? These difficulties mean that\nit would be premature to produce quantitative estimates of real ocean diffusivities using this\nmethod: a study is needed using more realistic ocean model geometry to determine how best to\napply the relationship we find.\nKurtosis does, however, have two advantages over effective diffusivity: it is very simple to\ncalculate, and it is a local quantity, meaning that maps are easily produced, unlike effective dif-\nfusivity which only varies in one spatial dimension (although it is less obvious how to produce\ntime series of kurtosis than of diffusivity). This means that it may be useful for quick identifi-\ncation of mixing barriers in a number of contexts. For example, it would be simple to extend\nthe present analysis to subsurface regions in an ocean model, permitting the investigation of the\nthree-dimensional geometry of mixing barriers. Similarly, the ideas should apply equally well to\natmospheric data. As White (1980) showed, a similar pattern (a zero skewness contour between\ntwo regions of significant skewness of opposite signs, coinciding with a region of low kurtosis)\noccurs in maps derived from 500 mbar geopotential height, though not at 1000 mbar. As with\nsea level, it may be that this picture would be sharpened by considering relative vorticity or PV.\nThere is a good case to make skewness and kurtosis (whether it is of sea level, relative vorticity,\nor PV) standard diagnostics to be used to assess the realism of eddying ocean models, as well as\nto understand the dynamics of jets and mixing.\nAcknowledgments\nThanks to Kevin Horsburgh for help with some basic statistical definitions.
