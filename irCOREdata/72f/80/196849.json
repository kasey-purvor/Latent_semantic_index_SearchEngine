One such inhibitor, ABT-263 has recently \nentered clinical trials. Almost all mechanistic and animal studies have been carried out \nwith the structurally related, ABT-737. Although such inhibitors will undoubtedly have \ngreatest value in combination chemotherapy, ABT-737 has shown promising potent single \nagent activity against certain primary tumor cells, including chronic lymphocytic \nleukemia (CLL) cells. We now show that although somewhat less active than ABT-737, \nABT-263 is also a potent inducer of apoptosis in CLL cells by a similar mechanism. \nHowever when tested in whole blood to mimic the in vivo situation, the activity of both \ninhibitors decreased ~100-fold largely due to binding to albumin, resulting in  a loss of \nthe potency and thus the selectivity of these inhibitors. The high binding of ABT-263 to \nalbumin highlights the necessity to monitor carefully patients for potential drug \ninteractions. \n \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n3 \n \nAbstract  \nPurpose: Inhibition of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family is one of the most promising areas \nof anti-cancer drug development. However, ABT-737, a specific BCL2 inhibitor, is \nneither orally bioavailable nor metabolically stable. To overcome these problems, the \nstructurally related molecule, ABT-263, was synthesized and recently entered clinical \ntrials in hematological malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). \nAlmost all laboratory studies have been carried out with ABT-737 rather than ABT-263, \nthe drug being used in clinical trials. Currently there are no published data on the \ncomparative effects of these inhibitors. To gain insight into the potential value or \nlimitations of ABT-263 in the clinic, we assess its ability to induce apoptosis in clinically \nrelevant cellular models of CLL.   \nExperimental design: The susceptibility of freshly isolated primary CLL cells to these \ninhibitors was compared in standard culture conditions and to more closely mimic in vivo \nconditions in a whole blood assay system.  \nResults:  ABT-737 was more potent than ABT-263 at inducing apoptosis in CLL cells.

We found that ABT-263 was highly bound by albumin and that an increased \nalbumin binding of ABT-263 as compared to ABT-737 accounted for the differential \nsensitivity of CLL cells.  \nConclusions: Our data indicate that the exquisite in vitro sensitivity of CLL cells to \nBCL2-inhibitors may be lost in vivo due to high cell densities and the albumin binding of \nABT-263. Modification of ABT-263 may yield a BCL2-inhibitor with greater \nbioavailability and more favorable pharmacokinetics. \n \n \n \n \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n4 \n \nIntroduction  \nThe induction of apoptosis by targeting of BCL2 proteins is one of the most promising \ntherapeutic approaches in various malignancies including CLL. CLL is generally \nconsidered incurable, although chemotherapy, radiotherapy and antibody-therapy are all \napplied to slow down the progression of the disease in aggressive cases of CLL. \nTherefore, less toxic and more efficient therapies are urgently required for this very \ncommon leukemia. CLL cells display very high levels of BCL2 and are dependent on \nBCL2 expression for their survival. Anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins, including \nBCL2, BCL-XL, MCL1 and BCL2A1, inhibit apoptosis by sequestering pro-apoptotic \nBCL2-homology domain 3 (BH3) containing proteins, like BIM, PUMA or BAX\/BAK. \nThe interaction of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members with these proteins occurs via a \nhydrophobic groove on the protein surface, into which BH3 domain-containing proteins \ncan bind (1, 2). Dependent on the structure of the hydrophobic groove and of the BH3 \ndomain, this binding can be very tight and very specific. Upon inhibition of BCL2 \nproteins, the pro-apoptotic binding partners are released and induce the release of \ncytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol, resulting in caspase-dependent apoptosis.  \nSeveral small molecule BCL2-inhibitors have been developed that mimic BH3 peptides \nand target the hydrophobic groove on BCL2 proteins (3-5). Amongst these obatoclax, \ngossypol and ABT-263 are currently in early clinical trials e.g. for CLL and Non-\nHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. However, more detailed mechanistic studies have highlighted that \nof all these potential BCL2-antagonists probably only ABT-737 and ABT-263 are specific \nBCL2 family antagonists (6, 7). Many other putative BCL2-antagonists seem to exert \nother major effects, which could lead to unwanted non-mechanism based toxicities (6, 7). \nThus at the present time we propose that only ABT-737 or ABT-263 can be used in either \nthe laboratory or clinic to evaluate both the therapeutic potential and mechanism based \ntoxicity of specifically inhibiting anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members. ABT-737 was \ninitially discovered in the Abbott laboratories using very elegant nuclear magnetic \nresonance-based screening, chemical synthesis and structure based-design (4). ABT-737 \ncaused a rapid induction of apoptosis in many cell lines and exerted potent anti-cancer \nactivity in various animal models either alone or more frequently in combination. \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n5 \n \nHowever as ABT-737 was rapidly metabolized, had a short half-life and was not orally \nbioavailable, it was modified in three key positions, resulting in the synthesis of ABT-\n263, which is both more metabolically stable and orally bioavailable (8).  \nIn both early clinical trials and animal studies the major dose-limiting mechanism-based \ntoxicity of ABT-263 is a transient thrombocytopenia due to apoptosis of platelets, whose \nsurvival is dependent on BCL-XL (9). Owing to their similar structure and binding \naffinities, ABT-737 and ABT-263 are often used interchangeably, and both display very \nhigh binding affinities to BCL2, BCL-w and BCL-XL, but only weak binding to MCL1 or \nBCL2A1 (4, 8). Therefore, high expression of MCL1 or BCL2A1 has been found to \nconfer resistance to ABT-737 (6, 10-12). Previous studies have shown that ABT-737 \nrapidly induces apoptosis in purified CLL cells at nanomolar concentrations in vitro (4, \n13, 14). Although separate studies on both ABT-737 and ABT-263 have been carried out, \nto our knowledge there are no published studies directly comparing ABT-263 and ABT-\n737. In this study, to mimic the clinical situation, CLL cells were incubated with ABT-\n737 and ABT-263 in a whole blood assay. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of CLL \ncells to both compounds was reduced by ~100-fold due to a combination of higher cell \ndensities in blood and significant albumin binding. \n.   \n \n \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n6 \n \nMaterial and Methods \nReagents \nABT-737 was provided by S. Rosenberg (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and \nABT-263 was provided by G. Shore (GeminX, Montreal, Canada). ABT-263 was \nsynthesized by published methods (8, 15) and its purity was 95.1% as assessed by HPLC \nand a correct mass of m\/z=975. After the start of this study a commercial source of ABT-\n263 also became available (Selleck Chemicals Co.,Shanghai, China). Essentially identical \nresults were obtained with both sources of ABT-263 (data not shown). Bovine serum \nalbumin (BSA) was from Sigma (Sigma Aldrich, Poole, United Kingdom), CD5-PE and \nCD19-FITC antibodies from Dako Cytomation (Dako Cytomation, Ely, United \nKingdom), rabbit anti-BAK antibody was from Upstate (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake \nPlacid, NY), Annexin-APC and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) were from \nInvitrogen (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom). Caspase-3 antiserum was provided by \nDr. Sun (MRC Toxicology Unit). \n \nCell culture \nPeripheral blood samples from CLL patients were obtained with patient consent and local \nethical committee approval. Unless otherwise indicated, lymphocytes were purified and \ncultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mM L-glutamine (all \nfrom Life Technologies, Inc, Paisley, United Kingdom) at 1 x 106 cells ml-1. CLL cells \nwere incubated with ABT-737 or ABT-263 at 37\u00b0C and apoptosis assessed as previously \ndescribed (14). Alternatively, blood from patients was incubated with ABT-737 or ABT-\n263 at 37\u00b0C in 48-well plates as described previously (16). Murine embryonic fibroblasts \nwere cultured in DMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc) supplemented with 10% FCS \nand 2 mM L-glutamine.  \n \nRelease of cytochrome c \n10 x106 CLL cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.05 % digitonin in \nmitochondrial isolation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 20 mM Hepes pH7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n7 \n \nmM KCl) for 10 min on ice. The cytosol was removed by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm \nfor 3 min. The permeabilized cells were washed three times in mitochondrial isolation \nbuffer without digitonin and incubated with different concentrations of ABT-737 or ABT-\n263 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Upon incubation, the supernatant containing the released cytochrome \nc was isolated by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 3 min and the supernatant and pellet \nwere analyzed by western blotting. \n \nF-Dextran release assay \nThe release of fluorescein-dextrans (F-dextrans) from liposomes was measured as \ndescribed previously (17). Briefly, liposomes containing 7% cardiolipin were generated \nby the extrusion method and internally loaded with fluorescein-dextran (10 kD) \n(Invitrogen). They were incubated with recombinant proteins (human origin); BAX, N\/C-\nBID (cleaved form of BID), BCL-XL with and without ABT-737 or ABT-263 (0.04-5 \n\u00b5M). After incubation, the assay mix was filtered to collect released dextrans in the \nfiltrate and the fluorescence was measured against a detergent solubilized sample, which \ngave 100 % release.    \n \nImmunoprecipitation \nFor immunoprecipitation (IP), 5 x 108 CLL cells were treated with ABT-737 or ABT-263 \nfor 2 h before lysis in buffer containing 1 % CHAPS, 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 8), 150 mM \nNaCl, and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Hamster \nanti-BCL2 Ab (BD Bioscience, San Diego, CA) was crosslinked with ProtA-dynabeads \nusing 20 mM dimethylpimelinediimidate (Fluka Biochemika, Switzerland). Crosslinked \nantibody or ProtA-dynabeads were incubated with 500 \u03bcg protein for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Beads \nwere washed with lysis buffer before elution in SDS-loading dye and western blotting.  \n   \nFluorescence Polarization Assay \nThe binding affinity of ABT-737 and ABT-263 to human serum albumin (HSA) was \nmeasured using fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) as described previously (18). \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n8 \n \nBriefly, 500 nM dansyl sarcosine or 1 \u03bcM dansyl L-glutamate (both from Sigma Aldrich) \nwere mixed with 5 or 10 \u03bcM HSA (CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany), respectively, and \ndifferent concentrations of ABT-737 or ABT-263. Polarized light (Exc: 340 nm, Em: 535 \nnm) was measured using EnVision 2102 Multilabel Reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, \nMA).  \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n9 \n \nResults  \nABT-263 is less potent than ABT-737 in inducing apoptosis in CLL cells \nIn this study we compared the in vitro efficacy of two very closely related BCL2-\nantagonists, ABT-737 and ABT-263. A direct comparison of the susceptibility of freshly \nisolated CLL cells to ABT-737 and ABT-263 in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS \nrevealed that both compounds induced efficient apoptosis but ABT-737 was ~4-fold more \npotent (Fig. 1A). This higher susceptibility of CLL cells to ABT-737 was observed in all \n21 samples examined (Fig. 1B). These initial findings indicate that despite their apparent \nstructural similarity (Fig. 1C) the two compounds possess different properties.  \nOne possible explanation of the reduced potency of ABT-263 compared with ABT-737 \ncould be due to it being inherently less potent. To investigate this possibility we \ncompared their activities in a model biochemical system, using liposomes loaded with \nfluorescein conjugated 10 kD dextran (F-dextran) (17). Addition of a combination of \nBAX and N\/C-BID resulted in permeabilization of the liposomes, as assessed by release \nof F-dextrans, and this permeabilization was inhibited by BCL-XL in agreement with \nprevious findings (17). The BCL-XL mediated inhibition of liposome permeabilization \nwas reversed in an almost identical concentration dependent manner by both ABT-263 \nand ABT-737 (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrated that both ABT-263 and ABT-737 \ntarget anti-apoptotic BCL-XL with similar efficiency in this model liposome system \ncontaining only BCL2 family members but devoid of extraneous proteins. Another \nexplanation of the lower potency of ABT-263 could be due to a lower plasma membrane \npermeability, which would result in less drug reaching its intracellular target(s), the anti-\napoptotic BCL2 family members. To address this possibility, we investigated the potential \nof ABT-737 and ABT-263 to induce cytochrome c release from permeabilized CLL cells \n(containing nuclei, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum) (Fig. 2B). ABT-737 was \nclearly more potent in inducing cytochrome c release from permeabilized cells. Taken \ntogether these results indicate that the reduced potential of ABT-263 to induce apoptosis \ncannot be explained solely by either differential plasma membrane permeability or by a \nlower potency of ABT-263 compared to ABT-737 to inhibit anti-apoptotic BCL2 family \nmembers.     \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n10 \n \nTo gain insight into the mechanism of ABT-263 induced cell death, we asked whether \nABT-263 induced activation of apoptotic signalling pathways. ABT-263 induced a rapid \ncleavage of caspase-3 and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, but was again less \npotent than ABT-737 (Fig. 3A and B). Since unstimulated CLL cells express very little or \nno BCL-XL, the main target of ABT-263 and ABT-737 in CLL cells is BCL2, where they \nact by displacing pro-apoptotic BH3 domain-containing proteins. To investigate the \nactivity of both compounds at the level of BCL2-inhibition, we immunoprecipitated \nBCL2 upon drug treatment and measured the levels of BAK displaced by ABT-737 and \nABT-263. Previously, we had shown that small amounts of BAK but not BAX were \nsequestered by BCL2 (12). In agreement with our earlier study, BAK was again shown to \nbe associated with BCL2 (Fig. 3C).  ABT-737 (10 or 100 nM) efficiently displaced BAK \nfrom BCL2, whereas higher concentrations of ABT-263 (100 nM) were required to \ninduce release of BAK (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that while both compounds \nhave the ability to displace BAK from BCL2, ABT-263 is less efficient than ABT-737. In \naddition, we recently described that ABT-737 induces a novel paradigm of apoptosis in \nCLL cells involving all the normal characteristics of apoptosis accompanied by a rupture \nof the outer mitochondrial membrane (14). Here we show that ABT-263 (100 nM) \ninduced similar ultrastructural changes to ABT-737 (10 nM), including condensed \nchromatin, rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane and loss of mitochondrial matrix \ndensity (Fig. 3D and E). Finally, ABT-263 induced apoptosis was completely inhibited in \nmurine embryonic fibroblasts deficient for Bax and Bak (Fig. 3F), suggesting that ABT-\n263, like ABT-737 (6, 7), is a specific inhibitor of BCL2 proteins. Taken together, our \ndata indicate that both compounds induce cell death by a similar mechanism involving \ndisplacement of BAK from BCL2 and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway \naccompanied by rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane.  \nThe efficiency of ABT-263 and ABT-737 decreased in whole blood \nIn order to more closely mimic the in vivo situation, we compared the efficacy of the two \ncompounds to induce apoptosis using whole blood from CLL patients rather than the \nstandard cell culture medium. At 4 h, ~100-fold higher concentrations of both BCL2-\nantagonists were required to induce apoptosis in CLL cells in blood compared to cell \nculture medium (compare Figs. 1A and 4A). The reduced potency of ABT-263 as \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n11 \n \ncompared to ABT-737 was even more pronounced in whole blood than in purified CLL \ncells. To investigate whether longer exposure times increased apoptosis, we incubated \nblood with different drug concentrations for up to 12 h. Whereas lower concentrations of \nABT-737 (0.1 \u2013 1 \u03bcM) induced apoptosis at longer exposure times, ABT-263 only \ninduced apoptosis at concentrations > 1 \u03bcM even when incubated for up to 12 h (Fig. \n4B).  \nBinding to albumin confers resistance to ABT-737 and ABT-263 \nAs these data clearly show that CLL cells lose their striking sensitivity towards these \ninhibitors in the presence of whole blood, we next investigated which components of \nwhole blood caused the loss of sensitivity to ABT-737 and ABT-263. In CLL, the white \nblood cell count in peripheral blood is regularly > 1 x 108\/ml, much higher than the \nconcentration of cells typically used in vitro (1 x 106\/ml). To examine the influence of \ncell density on the sensitivity to BCL2-antagonists, CLL cells were incubated at different \ndensities in culture medium.  Although a 10-fold higher cell density than used in our \nstandard culture did not significantly affect sensitivity, higher cell densities similar to \nthose found in the blood of CLL patients (1-5 x 108 cells\/ml) required higher \nconcentrations of ABT-737 and ABT-263 to induce cell death (Fig. 5A and B). \nFurthermore, we investigated whether the high serum content in blood compared to the \n10% serum routinely used in cell culture medium affected susceptibility to BCL2-\nantagonists. Higher serum concentrations (50% FCS) induced resistance to ABT-737 and \nABT-263, while lower serum concentrations (1% FCS) markedly sensitized CLL cells to \napoptosis induced by either drug (Fig. 5C and D). Similar responses to the presence of \nserum were found in cell lines, where higher serum concentrations resulted in decreased \nsensitivity to ABT-737 and ABT-263 (data shown to referees). During the initial chemical \nsynthesis of ABT-737, it was recognized that the lead compounds were largely \ninactivated by the presence of serum and the major inactivating component was due to \nbinding to domain III on human serum albumin (HSA) (19). Consequently ABT-737 was \ndesigned, in part, to overcome this high binding to albumin, which adversely affected the \nbinding to BCL-XL (4, 19). To investigate whether the inhibitory effect of serum on \napoptosis induced by ABT-737 or ABT-263 was due to the presence of albumin, 3% \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n12 \n \nbovine serum albumin (BSA), corresponding to the concentration of albumin in 50% \nFCS, was added. Notably, addition of BSA induced a similar shift in the concentration-\nresponse to ABT-737 or ABT-263 as 50% FCS (Fig. 5C and D). Since the sensitization by \nlow FCS concentrations (1%) could be completely reversed by addition of albumin, lack \nof growth factors or cytokines following serum withdrawal cannot account for the \nsensitization to BCL2-antagonists. These results strongly suggest that albumin was the \npredominant factor in serum responsible for resistance to ABT-263 or ABT-737.  \nABT-263 binds more tightly than ABT-737 to albumin \nTo further characterize the nature of the binding of ABT-737 and ABT-263 to albumin, \nwe used a fluorescence polarization assay. There are two main drug binding sites on \nHSA, site 1 on subdomain IIA and site 2 on subdomain IIIA (20, 21). Using two different \nprobes, dansyl sarcosine, which binds to site 2, and dansyl L-glutamate, which binds to \nsite 1, we were able to distinguish binding of ABT-737 and ABT-263 to the different HSA \nsubdomains. Interestingly, ABT-263 displayed a markedly higher binding affinity to site 2 \non HSA-IIIA than ABT-737 (Fig. 6A). Notably, the half maximal inhibitory concentration \n(IC50) of ABT-263 in this assay was 37 \u03bcM, which was lower than that displayed by the \npositive control naproxen (51 \u03bcM) which binds strongly to that site (18), indicating a \nvery tight interaction between HSA and ABT-263. While ABT-737 showed no binding to \nsite 1, ABT-263 also bound to site 1 on HSA-IIA with an IC50 of 145 \u03bcM (positive \ncontrol phenylbutazone: 49 \u03bcM) (18) (Fig. 6B). These data demonstrate that ABT-263 \nhas a higher albumin binding capacity than ABT-737, thus limiting the amount of free \ndrug that is available to interact with the intended target, BCL2.  \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n13 \n \nDiscussion \nDue to their ability to directly induce apoptosis, BCL2-inhibitors offer a great potential \nfor cancer therapy, especially for malignancies with high BCL2 expression and a \ndependency on BCL2 expression for survival (22). CLL cells were previously reported to \nbe highly sensitive to BCL2 inhibition and treatment with ABT-737 (4, 13, 14, 23). To \nour knowledge we now show for the first time that freshly isolated CLL cells display a \nsimilar, albeit somewhat lower, nanomolar sensitivity to ABT-263 (Fig. 1). ABT-263 \ninduced a rapid activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis that was absolutely \ndependent on Bax and Bak. Induction of apoptosis in CLL cells by ABT-263 was \naccompanied by chromatin condensation together with rupture of the outer mitochondrial \nmembrane and a decreased mitochondrial matrix density (Fig. 3), ultrastructural features \nvirtually identical to those we had previously observed with ABT-737 and described as a \nnovel paradigm of apoptosis (14). These results further emphasize the similar activities of \nABT-737 and ABT-263 in agreement with recent studies (15, 24)  and strongly support \nthe hypothesis that they both act to induce apoptosis in CLL cells by an identical \nmechanism. We emphasize the importance of studying these effects with ABT-263, as \nthis is the compound, not ABT-737, currently being used in clinical trials. \nMost importantly our data demonstrate that isolated CLL cells lose their striking \nnanomolar sensitivity to both ABT-737 and ABT-263 in the presence of whole blood. The \nEC50 of CLL cells to ABT-263 in whole blood is >10 \u03bcM at 4 h of treatment (Fig. 4A). \nNotably, the maximal plasma concentrations of ABT-263 achieved in clinical trials with a \n250 mg daily dosing schedule are around 5 \u03bcM (25), indicating that the concentrations in \nwhole blood might not be optimal in the current phase I and phase II clinical trials for \nABT-263. In our study we identify two factors that affect the efficacy of these BCL2-\ninhibitors: high cell density and plasma protein binding. In leukemic patients, the high \ncirculating cell densities might contribute to the resistance of CLL cells to ABT-737 and \nABT-263 that we observed in whole blood as compared to standard cell culture (Fig. 5 A-\nB). The impact of cell density on drug sensitivity may be a particular problem in certain \nmicroenvironments, such as lymph nodes, where drugs encounter even higher cell \ndensities than in the peripheral blood. We also describe that these BCL2-inhibitors are \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n14 \n \nextensively bound to albumin and that in the presence of albumin higher drug \nconcentrations are required for apoptosis induction (Fig. 5 C-D). Albumin is the most \nabundant protein in human plasma and is well known to bind a wide range of drugs as \nwell as endogenous molecules (18, 20, 21). ABT-263 bound to albumin much more \nstrongly than ABT-737 (Fig. 6) and it bound to site 2 on subdomain IIIA more strongly \nthan naproxen (18), indicating a very tight interaction between albumin and ABT-263. \nExtensive binding to albumin may have profound effects on the absorption, distribution, \nmetabolism and excretion of molecules, often meaning that higher doses need to be \nadministered in vivo (26, 27). The high albumin binding of ABT-263 may act a reservoir \nof the drug, resulting in a long half life. However, the high albumin-binding might also be \na source of potential drug interactions as ABT-263 may be displaced by other drugs that \nbind extensively to albumin, thus increasing the potential efficacy and toxicity of ABT-\n263. Additionally, our data indicate that patients with a hypoalbuminemia might react \ndifferently to ABT-263 and conditions where albumin levels are affected need to be \nclosely monitored for toxicities.  \nIt is interesting to consider the higher albumin binding of ABT-263 compared to ABT-737 \nin relation to their structures. During the development of ABT-263, the 4-chlorobiphenyl, \narylnitro and dimethylamino groups of ABT-737 (Fig. 1C, positions 1, 2 and 3, \nrespectively) were modified primarily to decrease metabolism and increase oral \nbioavailability without losing cellular activity. However, the dimethylamino group in \nABT-737, which had been specifically designed to reduce binding to albumin (19), is \nreplaced by a morpholino group in ABT-263 (8). In this regard the introduction of a \nmorpholino group at this position in the development of ABT-737 (compound 77R in \n(19)) was much less effective than a dimethylamino group in reducing the deactivating \neffects of serum on the binding affinity to BCL-XL and it was concluded that a charged \nspecies in this position was particularly effective in reducing serum binding (19). In the \nabsence of serum, the lead compounds in the ABT-737 series with the dimethylamino or \nmorpholino group showed similar binding affinities to BCL2 proteins, whereas in the \npresence of serum, the morpholino group resulted in a complete loss of binding to BCL-\nXL. These results indicate the potential deleterious effects of a morpholino group at this \nposition and indicate that although ABT-263 clearly shows important biological activity \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n15 \n \nthe possibility that substitution of another group in this position may yield a BCL2 family \ninhibitor with more favorable pharmacokinetics.  \nTo exclude any effects of serum or albumin, we wished to test the susceptibility of CLL \ncells to ABT-737 and ABT-263 in a serum-free system. However, culture of CLL cells in \nthe complete absence of any serum is not feasible because it is too toxic and cells \nunderwent spontaneous apoptosis (data not shown). Using a biochemical F-dextran \nrelease assay in liposomes, we found that both compounds have the same capacity to \ntarget BCL2 proteins, in line with previously published data reporting a similar affinity of \nboth compounds for BCL2 and BCL-XL (4, 28). However, the reduced activity of ABT-\n263 was also observed in permeabilized cells in the absence of any serum or albumin \n(Fig. 2B). These data indicate that besides the binding to albumin, other factors determine \nthe different biological activities of ABT-737 and ABT-263. One explanation could be \nthat besides binding to albumin, ABT-263 is also sequestered by other cellular proteins \nand therefore less drug reaches BCL2 even in the absence of serum. Some support for \nthis hypothesis is provided by our finding that in contrast to ABT-737, ABT-263 also \nbinds to site 1 on HSA-IIA, indicating that it binds in a more promiscuous manner than \nABT-737. Another explanation for the reduced activity of ABT-263, even in \npermeabilized cells in the absence of serum, might lie in as yet undescribed differences in \ntheir affinity to anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins or in their potential to displace BH3 \ndomain-containing proteins. In CLL cells obtained from blood, the main target of ABT-\n737 and ABT-263 is BCL2, since BCL-XL and BCL-w expression in circulating CLL \ncells is very low. However, the published data on the binding affinities of ABT-737 and \nABT-263 to BCL2 (< 1 nM) or BCL-XL (< 0.5 nM) display no difference (4, 28), \npossibly due to insufficient assay sensitivity. \nInterestingly, published data indicate that there might be cell-type specific differences in \nthe sensitivity to ABT-737 and ABT-263. In agreement with this suggestion, small cell \nlung cancer cell lines, H889 and H1417, showed a higher sensitivity to ABT-737 \ncompared with ABT-263, whereas others, including H146 and H82, demonstrated a \nsimilar sensitivity (28, 29). Our finding of a differential nonspecific binding of ABT-737 \nand ABT-263 to proteins, such as albumin, provides the first mechanistic explanation for \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n16 \n \na differential efficacy of ABT-737 and ABT-263. Whether a differential expression profile \nof BCL2 proteins also contributes to their differential sensitivity is not known.  \nTaken together our data suggest that although structurally similar and exhibiting similar \nbinding affinities to anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins, ABT-263 is less potent than \nABT-737 at inducing apoptosis in CLL cells. Furthermore, our data indicate that binding \nof ABT-263 to albumin will markedly increase the concentration of drug required to \ninduce apoptosis and clear CLL cells from the blood in vivo. We suggest that \nmodification of the albumin binding of ABT-263 either by alteration of its structure or by \nother strategies may restore the inherent susceptibility of CLL cells to these targeted \nBCL2-inhibitors thereby increasing their therapeutic potential. \n \n \n \nRunning title: Comparison of ABT-737 and ABT-263 in CLL \n \n17 \n \nReferences \n1.
