The overarching vision has been the provision of a virtual environment to assist in\ninforming and developing professional practice in the use of learning technologies. This\npaper outlines the issues and challenges in creating such a portal through the experiences of\ndeveloping the RESULTs Network. In the paper, design and participation issues are\nconsidered within the wider context of online and networked approaches to supporting\npractice and professional development. User participation methodologies and technical\ndevelopments for RESULTs are described in relation to a review of existing representations\nof practice and a comprehensive survey amongst the learning technology users' community.\nAn outline of key achievements and experiences is presented, followed by some conclusions\nregarding the cultural and political issues in creating a viable and sustainable facility and\nsuggestions for possible future direction in national provision.\nIntroduction\nMost higher education institutions have taken seriously the recommendations in the\nDearing Report concerning greater use of technology for learning and teaching (National\nCommittee of Inquiry into Higher Education (NCIHE), 1997). Each year, more teaching\nstaff are making use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools and\nenvironments with their students, or integrating digital resources into their courses. It is\nincreasingly evident (Armitage, Rothery and Jenkins, 1999; Beetham, 2000; Beetham,\nJones and Gornall, 2001) that nearly all universities and colleges now provide some form of\nspecific support for learning technology, indicated in the number of new posts and support\nunits created for this area. The result is a rapidly growing group of multi-skilled\n103\nJacqueline A. Dempster et al Creating virtual communities of practice for learning technology in higher education\nprofessionals, employed both within institutions and\/or nationally funded learning\ntechnology programmes and services, which have been such a key feature of the United\nKingdom experience.\nAs well as 'learning technologists', other categories of staff, such as librarians and IT\ndevelopers, teaching support staff, educational developers and institutional managers, are\ndeveloping new capabilities and understanding in learning technology (Gornall, 1999;\nGibbs, 2000; Beetham et al., 2001). Many such staff also have responsibility for brokerage\nof information and networking (Oliver, 2002).\nIt is notable that in a growing number of institutions and in national programmes, a major\ntheme appears to be to capture lessons learned on the use of ICT and, in particular, to\nimprove the dissemination and transfer of good practice. The abundance of new academic\nconferences and journals for learning technology is testimony to the high value placed on\ncommunication with others working in the field. However, learning technology roles and\npractices are diverse and poorly differentiated from one another and both the professional\npractice and the academic field of knowledge remain emergent (Conole, 2003).\nSupporting a learning technology community of practice\nA wide range of strategies is being used to support learning technology practice, including\nnational support agencies, institutional initiatives and via professional development\nprogrammes (see review by Lally and McConnell, undated). There remains a feeling,\nhowever, that learning technology support staff, and the academics they work with, do not \u2022\nhave easy online access to high-quality information and resources which, thanks to the\nJISC and other initiatives, are now available. A number of national studies (notably\nTALiSMAN, 1999; Armitage et al., 1999; Gibbs, 2000) have identified significant gaps in\nprovision of resources to assist staff involved with promoting and supporting the use of\nICT in teaching and learning. Access to information and resources is felt to be patchy and\nfinding materials is serendipitous and time-consuming.\nThose working in the field of learning technology benefit enormously from collaboration\nand exchange of expertise with colleagues in similar roles in other institutions. It was\ntherefore believed that the creation of a national portal to facilitate sharing and discussion\nof materials and methods used in learning technology practice would be beneficial. This\nrequires interoperability across the relevant professional and subject networks, but this\ntakes several forms - technical, semantic, cultural, educational and political, and any\nportal developed would need to address this.\nWhile this paper focuses on users of learning technologies, most of the factors, debates and\noutcomes overlap with other disciplines and are equally applicable to any educational\nportal supporting diverse communities of practice.\nCreating an online resource exchange and support network\nThe RESULTS Network project was devised by Jay Dempster and Clive Young under the\nJlSC-funded 5\/99 programme to provide a learning technology portal for United Kingdom\nhigher education. The portal aimed to offer a focus for professional exchange and\ndiscussion and to fill the gap in information, resources and communication identified by\n104\nALT-] Volume \\ I Number 3\nthe sector. RESULTs is the portal (www.resiilts.ac.iik) and the RESULTS Network its wider\ncommunity of users.\nProviding a portal service that will support and help transform practice must be subject to\nan understanding and appreciation of the variety of identities and roles that practitioners\ntake on, and the ways in which professional learning and teaching practice is changing.\nThe research underpinning much of the theoretical and overview materials was\ncommissioned early on and carried out by Beetham. Many of the key foundations of\nRESULTS stems from the findings of this user needs study (Beetham, 2001a) which\nincluded a literature review, an online survey, structured interviews and focus groups. The\nresearch instruments, survey methodology and study findings are described in detail in the\nfull report (Beetham, 2001a).\nThe study set out to identify the potential users of a learning technology portal, the nature\nof their practice, and the kinds of resource and service that can support them in developing\ntheir practice effectively. Factors motivating participation were explored in depth. The\nresearch findings strongly indicated that the users wanted a community-orientated\napproach to contribution and annotation of resources. RESULTs was built on the vision\nof a rich information environment for user-defined resource submission, access and dis-\ncovery coupled with facilities that encourage exchange and networking amongst\ncommunities of learning technology practice.\nThe project overall was led by Jay Dempster, and essentially has meant the development of\na database-driven Web architecture, undertaken by Steven Richardson using specifications\nidentified from the user participation studies and drawn up by Peter Jackson.\nThe RESULTs portal enables users to link to, categorize (and interlink) resources on the\nWeb, directly integrated with discussion areas, as well as providing personalization features\nand user profiling. No such facility previously existed in any single and coherent sense. The\nportal aimed to tackle the multidisciplinary nature of learning technology. It enables and\nencourages cross-fertilization across diverse categories of users in the sector and supports a\ncommunity approach to categorization and, as such, organic development of a consensus-\ndriven taxonomy for learning technology.\nRepresentations of practice for a virtual community\nThe theoretical and methodological touchstones for the user needs study and in turn for\nthe RESULTs Network development arise from a number of existing educational\nframeworks for developing virtual communities of practice (Beetham, 2002). Lave and\nWenger (1991) are the authors most closely identified with the idea of 'community of\npractice', which they describe as 'a set of relationships among persons, activity and world,\nover time, and in relation with other tangential and overlapping communities of practice'.\nIt is evident from experiences of knowledge modelling (Stefik, 1995) that procedural and\ntacit knowledge of practice and expertise can be difficult to capture and are strongly biased\ntowards subject knowledge and traditional modes of pedagogical practice in particular\ndisciplines. The ASTER project, for example, has found that terms such as 'seminar' or\n'tutorial' are open to interpretation and can relate to completely different sets of\npedagogical practices in different subject areas (ASTER, 1999).\n105\nJacqueline A. Dempster et al Creating virtual communities of practice for learning technology in higher education\nIn analysing online professional development networks, Foster, Bowskill, Lally and\nMcConnell (2000) found that they have several prerequisites: facilities for asynchronous\ndiscussion, shared information resources, tools (for collaboration itself, and to support\naspects of off-line practice), and investment of time and resource, both from the 'centre'\nand from participants. Action learning (Beaty and McGill, 1995) is likely to be a factor in\nmotivating participation in such networks, since all members will be novices in some\naspects of learning technology work but experts in others, and all will benefit from peer\nsupport in dealing with the 'real problems' of their practice.\nThe idea of organizing a professional network around specific shared activities brings in\nanother series of possible models from the literature on computer-supported collaborative\n(or cooperative) work (CSCW: for example McConnell, 2000; Kollock and Smith, 2000;\nBaecker, 1992) and the investigation of groupware systems. CSCW is usually seen as\ninvolving two interlinked activities: peer-to-peer communication and the development of\nshared artefacts. The Virtual Learning Space (http:\/\/www.vls.scotcit.ac.uk), a Scottish\nuniversities service, has used frequent real-time chat sessions and access to subject experts\nas a successful drive for participation. Another example is the Virtual Teacher Centre\n(http:llvtc.ngfl.gov.uk), a professional practice community, which includes a Teacher\nResource Exchange (http:llcontribitte.ngfl.gov.uk) designed to help teachers develop and\nshare ideas for activities in the classroom.\nFinally, online professional development networks will have some features of an academic\nresearch community or subject portal as learning technologies become an object of\nacademic study in their own right. Examples of good practice in United Kingdom higher\neducation include SOSIG(http:\/\/www.sosig.ac.uk) and the Learning and Teaching Support\nNetwork (LTSN) Engineering portal (http:\/\/www.ltsneng.ac.uk). SOSIG offers a one-stop\ngateway to scholarly resources for students and academics in the social sciences. SOSIG\nuses 'Harvester' technology to automatically gather new resources from the Web, based on\nURLs from the existing SOSIG catalogue. The LTSN Engineering portal exists to enhance\nlearning and teaching practice and is based not around content resources but orientated far\nmore towards engagement with their end users.\nUser engagement\nThe RESULTS user needs study (Beetham, 2001a) suggested that on visiting the portal,\nacademic teaching staff will have different needs from intermediaries such as educational\ndevelopers, learning technologists, IT developers, librarians, managers, project staff or\nresearchers. One way to view the needs of potential users is to identify questions that the\nvarious types of user are likely to ask. Three original areas of interest for developing\nRESULTs were addressed in the study. Key findings are presented here for each area.\nDeveloping artefacts for sharing practice knowledge\nArtefacts that are most effective in helping to transfer practice knowledge from one context\nto another were explored with a view to identifying resource types and availability of these\nwithin the community.\nThe user study distinguished resources that informed practice from those that were most\nlikely to be adopted in practice. The gap between encountering an idea and making\npractical use of it was smallest in the case of interactive resources, such as frameworks,\n106\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nguidelines and tools (Beetham, 2001b). While academic staff preferred materials with an\nexact fit to their own needs, intermediaries wanted adaptable resources. In theory, many of\nthe stated requirements could be met by materials currently used in practice, re-purposed\nfor local support needs, such as guidance notes and workshops. This was precisely the\napproach taken by a ScotCIT project, SeSDL {http:llwww.sesdl.scotcit.ac.uk), in\ndeveloping a Web-based resource centre to encourage sharing and reuse of staff\ndevelopment materials. In this case, it might be argued that the most effective materials are\nthose that are most readily adaptable and usable by other staff and educational developers,\nrather than those which are most directly accessible for academics (Beetham, 2001b). In\nreality, the difficulties in terms of user participation are with regard to metadata\ndescription and the conflict of interest between user needs for rich descriptions and\nprovider requirements, including expertise and the time to create informative metadata.\nDeveloping forums for discussion\nForms of online dialogue that can support effective sharing of practice and the role and\nintegration of local (offline) dialogue were explored. Learning technology specialists are\nrequired to undertake continuous learning as their area of expertise moves on. Normal\npractice could be described as 'peer supported experimentation'. Collaborative online\ncommunities of practice and virtual play spaces are seen as valuable opportunities to\nengage in this. Academic staff also needed dialogues, but favoured face-to-face\nrelationships in their own context of practice. All those surveyed emphasized the value of\nexamples and experiences from practice and opportunities for communication: discussion,\nreflection, networking and peer learning, from their desktop, and as needed. Networking is\nregarded as a high priority by all staff, though given the choice they prioritize contacts,\nevents and discussion forums over access to materials and resources.\nUsers emphasized the need for easy-to-use tools for engaging with the online community:\nfinding, contributing and commenting on resources and for locating other people with\nrelevant expertise. Good examples include the SOSIG 'grapevine' facility for contacting\nother people with similar interests and the Amazon intelligent search results with links to\nreviews. Users valued push forms of information dispersal for current information\nproviding it could be filtered for relevance.\nDeveloping networks and communities of practice\nIt was important to identify the potential users of, and contributors to, the portal and their\nrequirements and motivations to participate. Previous user needs analyses for the Resource\nDiscovery Network (RDN) portals have been able to focus on a specific subject\ncommunity, and its need for discipline- and content-based resources in relation to a\nrelatively well-established set of academic practices - teaching and learning. Learning\ntechnology users were likely to be found from both this set and from those in a multitude of\nroles across discipline and institutional communities, engaged in poorly defined, yet often\ninnovative, practices, and requiring support that is practice- rather than content-focused.\nThere were debates over whether a potential RESULTS community was really a fairly small\ninner core of learning technology specialists, or the large periphery of casual and potential\nlearning technology users, including academic staff and educational researchers.\nWe explored how practitioners collaborate with one another offline and how active online\nparticipations can be encouraged and supported so that it is integrated and self-sustaining\n107\nJacqueline A. Dempster et al Creating virtual communities of practice for learning technology in higher education\nwithin an overall professional development activity. The study revealed an apparent conflict\nbetween the problem-solving culture of much learning and teaching practice - the 'instant\ngratification' of a tip or trick discovered from the academic desktop, or the more considered\nsolutions arrived at by collective brainstorming and the long-term habits of reflective\npractice and professional scholarship. A portal that focused only on this problem-solving\nculture would be doing little to raise the status and scholarship of teaching.\nThose surveyed felt that a national service to support communities of practice in learning\ntechnology might best focus on direct, personal participation by its core community, but\nwork towards indirect participation (for example, via LTSN subject portals or institutional\nVLEs) by a much broader community of users. It is likely that many users will continue to\nseek peer exchange, services and benefits through offline networks, and many people are\nlikely to turn to online support only when avenues of face-to-face help have been\nunproductive. The survey identified a desire for national updates via a briefing service,\ncalendar of events, news service and integration of face-to-face workshops. A directory of\nexpertise and various types of discussion areas were also specified.\nDevelopment of the RESULTS network\nBringing together the above elements was a key aim of RESULTS. Three main structural\nlists were identified for use in RESULTs: user types, resource types and interaction types\n(Beetham, 2001a, 2001b; but see also Goodyear and Steeples, 1998, and Oliver and Conole,\n2001). Functionally, professional development networks might usefully be grouped into\ntwo broad areas: facilities for interaction with artefacts; facilities for interaction with\nindividuals\/groups; with a third hybrid area of facilities for developing or enriching\nartefacts (Mulholland, Domingue, Zdrahal and Hatala, 2000), which is in itself a form of\nindirect communication with others. For RESULTS, it was felt that these different facilities\nneeded to be seamlessly integrated to support the full representations of practice identified.\nThey also needed to be capable of evolution as users discover new ways of interacting with\none another and with their shared resources.\nThe RESULTs environment comprises three areas: 'MyRESULTs', 'Resources' and\n'Communities'. Visually, these appear separate on the site (Figure 1) but are functionally\nintegrated through associations between resources, users and practice. However, the\ndistinction serves as a reminder that RESULTs is not concerned principally with resources\nbut with resources that relate to practice. Resource metadata is kept to a minimum taking\ninto account the conflict between the needs of contributors and users identified in the\nstudy area concerned with developing artefacts for sharing practice knowledge.

It is intended that resources are constantly com-\nmented upon, updated, contextualized, organically developed - in fact, resources should\nsimply be contingent traces of the community process, rather than ends in themselves.\nThe RESULTs portal is based on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) architecture\nand demonstrates a wide range of user-orientated, practice-centred functionality and\ninteroperable Web technologies (Richardson and Powell, 2003; Richardson, Childs and\nDempster, in preparation; for more information, see the CETIS Website) and an integrated\ndiscussion board (Phomm) on which a narrative of RESULTs design and development can\nbe found.)\n108\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\n' 5 Result Home Page \u2022 Microsoft Internet EHplorcr piavidcd by the Uriivcnsil?

From the MyResidts area, users\ndevelop a personal profile of expertise (MyProfile: initially created on registration) and can\nlist their own contributions (MyContributions). The system can also support production of\na record of activities on RESULTs (MyActivityLog).\nUnder Communities (Figure 1), a 'directory of expertise' is available in the collective\nProfiles Directory providing a source of contacts for finding expertise or common areas of\ninterest. Users can also share approaches in practice: by contributing to Tips and Tricks,\nIssues and Problems, Inspirations and Innovations. They can start or contribute to\nDiscussion Forums: associated with a resource or independently. Special interest groups are\navailable for sharing resources amongst specific collaborative groupings.\nTechnical developments - behind the scenes\nMetadata submission and forms handling\nAlthough user demands for searchable and well-contextualized resources suggest the use of\nstandard templates for submission of metadata, this is not a straightforward task. First,\nJacqueline A Dempster et al Creating virtual communities of practice for learning technology in higher education\nthe Learning Object Metadata standard does not extend to describing resources for which\nthe primary intended user is not the learner. Second, potential end-users had concerns\nabout the time involved in submitting metadata. RESULTS developed a form handling\napplication and a lightweight approach to resource description to cope with the demands\nof submission process and user interaction.\nExporting taxonomy using IMS Metadata and the OA1-PMH\nRESULTS operates as a fully functional OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for\nMetadata Harvesting) repository which means that any compliant OAI harvester can\nretrieve metadata records in XML format from the RESULTS database. These records are\navailable as minimal Dublin Core or as extensive IMS records. Instructions on how to use\nthe protocol may be found on the Open Archives Website (http:\/\/www.openarchives.org).\nThe categorization route(s) of a resource - may be extracted as taxonpath elements (IMS\nMetadata 9.2). This provides a mechanism by which resources can be programmatically\nimported from one database into another (via OAI-PMH) and automatically placed in the\nright location in the category or directory structure of the importing database system\ncreating new categories as required should taxons (categories) from a taxonpath not exist.\nIn this way, we can merge taxonomies very easily, starting with an empty or existing\nstructure (Richardson et al, in preparation). Bearing in mind that taxonomies (even\nestablished ones) are continually evolving, this is crucial.\nRSS feeds\nThe ten most recently submitted RESULTS resources are available over an RSS feed\n(http:llwww.resiilts.ac.ukltoplO_rss.php). This is demonstrated- on the LTSN Materials\nEducation Website (http:\/\/www.materials.ac.iiklfeatureslresiiltsproject.asp). An innovative\nuse of RSS provides basic remote search capabilities to RESULTS (http:llwww.\nmaterials.ac.uk\/technical\/results\/search.asp). A description of the RSS service is available\non the RESULTS development website (http:\/\/www.residts.ac.uk\/aar\/presentations.php).\nz39.50\nRESULTS also runs a z39.50 server connected directly to the relational database which can\nreturn Dublin Core XML records. This server provides Boolean\/multi-field search function-\nality for RESULTS and given more time and resources it could be opened to the world in\ngeneral as a full z39.50 service. At present access to the server directly is blocked by a firewall.\nKey achievements and experiences\nIn addressing the needs of users identified within the learning technology communities of\npractice, there have been two major successes in creating the RESULTS Network. The first\nis in the selection and development of the technologies that drive it. The second is in the\nproof of concept. However, RESULTS has been less successful in securing a critical mass\nof user participation. This is most likely to do with the need for integration and continuity\nwithin existing services offering regular face-to-face activities and off-line networks. This is\ndiscussed here as a third cultural and political issue for user participation.\nTechnologies\nIn terms of the technologies, significant success rested on development work in new and\nuntested territories. The technologies selected as fit-for-purpose and implemented within\n112\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nthe RESULTs architecture are novel (at least to higher education and the education\nsectors). It was necessary to resolve technical as well conceptual problems in clean and\nuncluttered ways and, given the relatively small nature of the RESULTs project, to do so\nwith a single Web developer. RESULTs uses open source technologies and is not based on\nany proprietary software or code. It means that we have been able to draw upon and\ncontribute to a large and developing body of knowledge and expertise.\nWhile database-driven Websites and portals are far from new, we believe that RESULTs\nhas been constructed and managed, from a technical point of view, in quite unique ways.\nAll resources are submitted and managed online through the actual portal itself, and not\nthrough some intermediary content management system or human moderator. We know of\nno other examples of such an approach in portal systems and it works exceptionally well.\nInteroperability has also been a high priority. RESULTs has gone a very long way and now\nrepresents a full complement of protocols: OAI-PMH (Protocol for Metadata Harvesting),\nRSS feeds and z39.50 searching (Richardson and Powell, 2003). Resource records are all\nDublin Core and IMS conformant and can be exchanged using the corresponding XML\nschemas. We believe this represents the forefront of thinking and development in this area\nin the education sector.\nFinally RESULTs is fast. Code has been specifically developed and rebuilt and graphical\nimages kept to a minimum to enable the RESULTs portal to work at lightning speeds. It\nloads quickly, even on a machine with a standard modem connection; navigation around\nthe portal and submissions to the portal are to all intents and purposes instantaneous.\nProof of concept\nThe second major success of RESULTs has been in the 'proof of concept'. The concept\nfocused on how a dynamic, database-driven portal - one that has a clear target audience\nand has undertaken specific user needs analysis - can work. We have successfully linked\nresources and resource submission to people, working on the key metaphor of\n'communities of practice'. RESULTs offers a portal that is largely owned and designed by\nits users. It is community driven and has the significant potential to reflect, support and\nintegrate a complex group of user communities.\nOne implementation approach that was perhaps rather brave is the unmoderated resource\nsubmission. We trust our users in their professional conduct as it is open to misuse, even\nabuse. To our knowledge no other educational portal does this. All other services are\nmoderated in some way, by some form of editorial or other quality control process. Indeed,\nthe approach supports the concept of reflecting on one's own professional practices, as it\nrequires users to exercise a high degree of reflection and judgement on the purpose and\nvalue of the resource to practice. Importantly, it also avoids resources being dumped into\nthe database just to populate it with all and sundry.\nThe RESULTs environment supports learning technology communities of practice by\noffering an organic means for development of a taxonomy supporting the diverse sub-\ncommunities of learning technology practice to become transparent with consensus\nreached over a period of time. A substantial step in terms of interoperability of this\nconcept was taken by making resources, their 'taxonpath', and the tree 'transportable',\nallowing embedding within other compatible databases.\n113\nJacqueline A Dempster et al Creating virtual communities of practice for learning technology in higher education\nUser participation\nGiven the short time scale of the project, the usage of the RESULTS portal site is currently\nmodest and a critical mass is far from being reached. The reasons for the slow progression\nof uptake are complex and overlapping but include the innovation of user-driven and\ntechnical approaches and the pervasive 'not invented here' culture of higher education.\nThis could have been overcome had a national agency driven and marketed it. It seems\nunlikely that the permanent revolution in individual and collective practice which is\ndemanded by educational technology will ever be sustained without the support of local,\nface-to-face dialogues such as those offered by the more permanent national services and\nsupport bodies. Despite early measures to ensure that such partnerships were forged,\nparticularly with the LTSN and ALT who were partners in the project from the outset,\nvarious political developments delayed any definitive commitment to host and further\ndevelop or drive the RESULTS Network. A scoping study undertaken by RESULTS\n(Jackson, 2002) with additional funding from the JISC focused upon identifying key issues\nand requirements in the development of a learning and teaching portal as a joint venture\nbetween the LTSN Generic Centre and the JISC. The study draws heavily on the\nconceptual framework for RESULTS, the user participation findings, technical\ndevelopments and project experiences and in so doing is a major legacy for RESULTS in\nshaping this and other future portal developments. Through collaboration with ANGEL\n(Authenticated Networked Guided Environment for Learning), a JISC 5\/99 DNER project\nat the LSE concerned with creating middleware services {http:ll ANGEL www.angel.ac.uk),\nRESULTS is currently hosted by LSE.\nConclusions and future directions\nThere is still much vagueness concerning the nature of portals. It is not yet understood how\npeople make use of portals, or whether personalization is useful. Furthermore, there needs\nto be a greater clarity in the relationship between national and institutional portals or\nbetween information-based portals and learning-based portals (EDNER, 2002).\nWhat is clear from both the user participation survey and our own experiences, at least for\nprofessional development networks, is the need to build links between virtual 'portal'\nactivities and face-to-face activities such as workshops and conferences. The portal must\nendeavour to become a part of the wider communities and networks - which means the\nportal must become the online part of the communities and networks that users already\nbelong to. The notion of roving facilitators to bridge online and offline communities of\npractice is one possible mechanism for managing continual engagement of practitioners.\nDirected and scaffolded support is likely to motivate participation in both online and off-\nline professional development, such as that provided through the structured and formal\nframework of activities and opportunities within CPD accredited programmes. (Indeed,\nSEDA, ALT and the ILTHE are exploring routes specifically for learning technologists.)\nAs the portal is seen to offer facilities that are valuable, timely, engaging, fruitful and\ninspiring, word will consequently pass around those networks, and users may then start to\nturn to the portal as a first priority.\nThere is a strong indication that RESULTS will be sustainable in the long term only as part\nof more general learning and teaching portals and only providing that it is cross-searchable\nfrom the subject portals which are becoming the recognized repositories of practice-based\n114\nAw-J Volume 11 Number 3\ninformation for United Kingdom higher education. Integration of learning technology\ncommunities of practice would thus incorporate users who may utilize more specific or\nlocal entry points. There is a danger that a focus on access to information and resources per\nse will allow portals to become perceived as administrative repositories simply affording\naccess to the 'knowledge' that the user needs, rather than offering tools for educational\nannotation and thus supporting shared professional scholarship and growth.\nOn balance, RESULTS has been successful in developing a portal system that offers a\nvaluable range of professional exchange functionality and interoperability. Given the\ncollective accomplishments within learning technology communities in United Kingdom\nhigher education and further education, the only constraining factors remain with the\npolitical dimension of joined-up thinking in the aforementioned portal developments.\nEffective collaboration between national agencies is a key requirement, coupled with the\nneed for sustainable development in project-initiated services: a matter for the funding\ncouncils.\nAcknowledgements\nRESULTs has been a worthwhile project and we are grateful to the JISC for its initial\nfunding and on-going support and enthusiasm for the work.\nThe authors wish to thank the wide range of learning technologists, educational and staff\ndevelopers, academic staff and many other researchers and practitioners for their\ninvolvement and commitment to exploring the conceptual and technical parameters on\nwhich portal development relies. The journey towards providing a one-for-all, lively and\neffective online community of practice for learning technology has really only just begun.\nReferences\nArmitage, S., Rothery, J. and Jenkins, M.
