At current prices the benefits of variable rate \napplication of nitrogen exceed the returns from a uniform application by an average of \n\u00a322 ha-1.  The cost of the precision farming systems range from \u00a35 ha-1 to \u00a318 ha-1 \ndepending upon the system chosen for an area of 250 ha. The benefits outweigh the \nassociated costs for cereal farms in excess of 80 ha for the lowest price system to 200 \u2013 \n300 ha for the more sophisticated systems.  The scale of benefits obtained depends upon \nthe magnitude of the response to the treatment and the proportion of the field that will \nrespond.  To be cost effective, a farmed area of 250 ha of cereals, where 30% of the area \nwill respond to variable treatment, requires an increase in crop yield in the responsive \nareas of between 0.25 t ha-1 and 1.00 t ha-1 (at \u00a365 t-1) for the basic and most expensive \nprecision farming systems respectively.  \n \n1 Introduction \nThe potential benefits of managing crops using precision farming techniques include:  \n(1) The economic benefit of an increase in crop yield, and\/or a reduction in inputs i.e. \nseed, fertiliser and agrochemicals, and  \n(2) The environmental benefit from a more precise targeting of agricultural chemicals.   \n \nOver the past decade the technology has become commercially available to enable the \nfarmer to both spatially record the yield from a field (Murphy et al., 1995; Birrell et al., \n1996; Stafford et al., 1996) and vary both seed and fertiliser rates on a site-specific basis. \nSignificant advances have also been made (Miller & Paice, 1998) to permit the spatial \n 3\ncontrol of weeds on a site specific basis by varying the dose rate of herbicides depending \nupon the weed density.  However, the benefits of either an increase in yield and\/or a \nreduction in fertilisers and agrochemicals have to be offset against the costs of investing \nin specialist equipment to enable yield maps to be produced and variable applications to \nbe implemented.  The aim of this paper is to address these issues. \n \nA range of potential benefits have been reported, from various combinations of \ndifferent variable application rate practices.  Earl et al. (1996) postulated a potential \nbenefit of \u00a333.68 ha-1 could be possible combining variable nitrogen application and \ntargeting subsoiling to headlands for a crop of wheat in the UK, when wheat prices were \n\u00a3125 t-1.  Increases in returns exceeding \u00a357 ha-1 ($80 ha-1), when maize seed rates were \nvaried according to soil depth, were reported by Barnhisel et al. (1996).  Measured \nbenefits in the range of - \u00a311.14 to \u00a374.09 ha-1 (-$6.37 to $42.38 ac-1) were reported by \nSnyder et al. (1998) on irrigated maize in the USA.  Schmerler & Basten (1999) \nmeasured an average benefit of \u00a338.60 ha-1 (60 DM ha-1) when growing wheat on a farm \nscale trial where both seed and agrochemical rates were varied.   \n \nStudies conducted by James et al. (2000) investigated the benefits of using historic \nyield data as a guide to varying nitrogen application, for winter barley on a field with both \nclay loam and sandy loam soil types.  Data from the first years results, i.e. 1997 harvest \nreported by Godwin et al. (1999), indicated that an economic benefit of \u00a327.60 ha-1 could \nbe possible.  This analysis was based upon spot measurements of the yield rather than \nthose for the complete zone in either soil type, however, it is generally indicative of the \npotential benefits.  A further part of the experiment applied nitrogen based upon the \ncalculated value of the most economic rate of nitrogen (MERN) and nitrogen rate for \n 4\nmaximum yield (NMAX) in the previous year, after the principles developed by \nKachanososki et al. (1996).  The main conclusions of this research were that:  \n(1) the maximum yield of the response curve for each soil type (NMAX), occurred \nat the same application rate in each growing season,  \n(2) the MERN for each soil type were not significantly different, and  \n(3) based on yield information from previous yield maps, there was no simple \nvariable rate application strategy that provided a yield or economic benefit \ncompared to a uniform application of nitrogen fertiliser.   \n \nThe work reported in Godwin et al. (1999) also demonstrated the effect of the \nnitrogen\/grain price ratio on the economic return to variable application of nitrogen and \nthat at 1999 prices of \u00a380 t-1 for grain and \u00a30.30 kg-1 for nitrogen the MERN rates were \n15 to 30 kg ha-1 lower than NMAX. \n \nThe costs of implementing precision farming practices have been reported by a number \nof researchers.  Earl et al. (1996) estimated the costs of yield map production and the \nability to apply fertiliser on a site-specific basis to be \u00a310.46 ha-1 for an arable area of 250 \nha, at 7% interest rate amortised over a 5 year period in the UK.  A later estimate of \u00a37.81 \nha-1 was made by James (1998), for a similar system, the difference in cost being the \nreduction in hardware and software cost over the 2 year period and the removal of the \nDGPS costs.  In the same year studies, in the USA, by Snyder et al. (1998) estimated the \ncost of yield mapping and variable rate equipment, for nitrogen application, for two fields \nof 49 and 64 ha as \u00a38.50 ha-1 ($11.88 ha-1).  Studies by Schmerler and Basten (1999) \nreported costs of \u00a315.46 ha-1 (49 DM ha-1) for a 7,100 ha German farm, of which 3,900 ha \nwas suitable for site-specific management.  The major reason for the higher figures \n 5\nreported by Schmerler and Basten (1999) was the cost of the equipment to variably apply \nherbicides in addition to the seed rate and fertiliser. \n \nThis paper: \n(1) examines the increase in revenues that have been achieved through the use of \nprecision farming practices during a three-year study of 5 fields in cereal production \nin Southern England, where:  \n(a) the effect of variable nitrogen application to both barley (Welsh et al., 2001a) \nand wheat (Welsh et al., 2001b) using historic yield map and real time shoot \ndensity data have been investigated, \n(b) significant yield improvements have been made using \u201creal time\u201d nitrogen \nmanagement in the wheat crop based upon variations in crop canopy (Wood \net al., 2001a), and  \n(c) improvements to common crop management problems (e.g. waterlogging, \nrabbit damage and fertiliser application error, Wood et al. (2000a)) can be \nidentified and corrected.  \n(2) estimates of the costs of upgrading farm equipment, at the time of purchase, to a \nlevel that enables precision farming techniques to be practised, and   \n(3) compares the costs\/benefits and analyses the potential returns from adopting \nprecision farming technology for given farm sizes and levels of variability. \n \n2 Potential benefits from adopting precision farming \nThe potential benefits considered in this paper arise from: \n \n(1) studies to determine the spatially optimum nitrogen application rate using  \na) historic yield, and shoot density (Welsh et al., 2001a & b for barley and wheat \nrespectively), and  \n 6\nb) canopy structure (Wood et al., 2001a for the wheat crop), and \n(2) identifying and correcting common site-specific problems associated with crop \nmanagement. \n \n2.1 Historic yield \nVariation of nitrogen according to historic yield trials were conducted over a period of \nthree years in three fields, Trent Field, Twelve Acres and Far Sweetbrier, using both \nvariable and uniform application rate strategies (Welsh et al., 2001a & b).  The variable \nrate strategies were divided up to give the following treatments: \n \n2.1.1 Historic yield 1 (HY1).   \nWhere the high yield zone received 25 - 30% more nitrogen; the average yield zone \nreceived the standard nitrogen rate; and the low yield zone received 25 - 30% less \nnitrogen. \n \n2.1.2 Historic yield 2 (HY2).  \nWhere the high yield zone received 25 - 30% less nitrogen; the average yield zone \nreceived the standard nitrogen rate; and the low yield zone received 25 - 30% more \nnitrogen. \n \nA further two alternative strategies, HY3 and HY4, could be extracted from the data. \nHY3 received 25 - 30% more nitrogen on the high yielding zone whilst the remainder of \nthe field received the standard application rate and HY4 received 25 - 30% more nitrogen \non the low yielding zone with the standard application rate applied on the other areas. \n \n 7\nThe economic consequences, excluding the costs of variable application equipment, \nachieved from the HY1, 2, 3 and 4 management strategies, with grain at \u00a365 t-1 and \nnitrogen at \u00a30.30 kg-1, are presented in Table 1.  It can be seen from Table 1 that HY1 and \nHY2 produced negative returns in 8 and 6 of the 9 trials respectively.  Twelve Acres was \nparticularly unresponsive to variable rate application of nitrogen with only the 1998\/99 \nHY4 strategy producing a positive benefit of \u00a34.55 ha-1. \n \nThe mean benefit recorded in Trent field for HY3 and HY4 strategies of \u00a39.67 and \n\u00a314.15 ha 1 respectively were a consequence of the crop being grown for malting in \n1997\/98 and 1998\/99.  Therefore, to retain the malting quality premium of \u00a310 t-1 the \napplied nitrogen rate was below that required to produce maximum yield. \n \nThe mean benefit for each strategy over all fields and all years is presented in Table 2.  \n \nThe following conclusions can be drawn from the data: \n(1) varying nitrogen fertiliser application according to historic yield strategies HY1 and \nHY2 has not, in these field trials, produced a positive benefit,  \n(2) the HY3 strategy, of feeding only the higher yielding area, produced a small \npositive benefit, and \n(3) feeding the low yielding areas HY4 produced an overall benefit of \u00a37.59 ha-1. \n \n2.2 Shoot density approach \nNitrogen application rate was varied according to the density of shoots (i.e. number of \nshoots m-2) in parallel with the historic yield studies described above (Welsh et al., 2001a \nand b).  The shoot densities being determined in near real time using NDVI data for the \n 8\nfield from airborne digital photography calibrated against a number of spot measurements \nof shoot density (Wood et al, 2001b).  Two application strategies were adopted: \n \n(1) Shoot density 1 (SD1).  Where the areas of high shoot density received 30% more \nnitrogen; the areas of average shoot density received the standard nitrogen rate; and \nthe areas of low shoot density received 30% less nitrogen. \n(2) Shoot density 2 (SD2). Where the areas of high shoot density received 30% less \nnitrogen; the areas of average shoot density received the standard nitrogen rate; and \nthe areas of low shoot density received 30% more nitrogen. \n \nAt the outset of the experiment high and low shoot densities were terms used to \nexpress relative shoot densities compared with the field average, which changed from one \nseason to the next.  In the second and third years, however, there was little variation in the \nshoot density along the experimental strip in Twelve Acre, hence a uniform application \nwas made and in Far Sweetbrier there were no relatively high shoot density zones.  This \nnaturally led into the more objective approach to nitrogen management based upon \nabsolute values of shoot density using crop canopy management reported in the next \nsection.  The economic consequences of managing nitrogen using the shoot density \napproach are summarised in Table 3, which shows that both SD1 and SD2 strategies \nproduced an overall small positive benefit over the three year period in Trent field. \n \nThe apparent reversal of crop response to SD1 and SD2 strategies between the 97\/98 \nand both 98\/99 and 1999\/2000 seasons, in Trent Field, may be explained by the method \nused to determine the thresholds between high and low shoot densities.  The average \nshoot densities were c. 1400 shoots m-2, c. 950 shoots m-2 and c. 1070 shoots m-2 in the \n 9\n1997\/98, 1998\/99 and 1999\/2000 seasons respectively.  If the criteria for defining shoot \ndensity in 1997\/98 had been applied to 1998\/99 and 1999\/2000 seasons the high density \nzone in both seasons would have been re-classified as low and the SD2 strategy would \nhave been the most effective.  The variation in establishment was probably due to adverse \nweather conditions in the 1998\/99 season.   \n \nFar Sweetbrier performed marginally above standard farm practice in 1997\/98 and \nbelow standard for the remaining two years for the SD1 regime and significantly better \nthan the standard farm practice for the SD2 regime in the final two years, with a small \nreduction in 1997\/98.  There were no high shoot density areas in the 1998\/99 and \n1999\/2000 seasons, therefore, the SD1 strategy only consisted of removing nitrogen from \nthe low shoot density areas, and hence the poor return in these two seasons.  Whereas the \nSD2 strategy added nitrogen to the low shoot dentistry areas improving their response. \n \nThe average return of \u00a329.90 ha-1 recorded in Far Sweetbrier for the SD2 strategy \nimplies that this method of management could have advantages.  This was true especially \nin the final 2 years of the experiment when due to the absence of a relatively high shoot \ndensity zone, the fertiliser management regime consisted of only applying nitrogen to the \nrelatively low shoot density areas. \n \n2.3 Crop canopy approach \nTwo fields, growing winter wheat, were used to conduct variable nitrogen application \ntrials to investigate potential benefits that may be gained from managing the crop canopy \nin real time by varying nitrogen application (Wood et al., 2001a).  Each field plot \ncomprised a series of either 20 m or 24 m wide field length strips with differing seed rates \n 10\nin alternate strips.  Nitrogen was applied uniformly to a 10 m or 12 m wide longitudinal \nsplit of the strip at a rate representative of the standard farm practice whilst the remaining \n10 m to 12 m strip section received nitrogen at varying rates depending on crop canopy \nstructure.  Canopy structure was determined using aerial digital photography (ADP) \ntechniques to measure shoot density and green area index (GAI) as discussed in Wood et \nal. (2000b).  Nitrogen application rate was determined according to whether the canopy \nwas observed to be \u201con-target\u201d, \u201cbelow-target\u201d or \u201cabove-target\u201d according to benchmark \nfigures set out in the Wheat Growth Guide (HGCA 1998).  The difference in the \neconomic performance of variable and standard nitrogen application for all seed rates are \nsummarised in Table 4.   \n \nIt can be seen from Table 4 that benefits of variably applying nitrogen in comparison \nwith uniform application, based on the standard farm practise, range from -\u00a31 ha-1 (Far \nHighlands @ 195 plants m-2) up to \u00a360 ha-1 (Onion Field @ 200 plants m-2).  The mean \nbenefit over all seed rates in Onion Field was \u00a336.50 ha-1.  This benefit is marginally \nmore than the mean benefit obtained from SD2 in Far Sweetbrier which over a period of 3 \nseasons averaged a \u00a333.58 ha-1 improvement over the uniform rate of N application for \nwheat.  The overall mean improvement in Onion Field and Far Highlands was \u00a322 ha-1. \n \n3 Estimation of the costs of precision farming systems \n3.1 Precision farming monitoring and control systems \nA full precision farming (PF) system comprises hardware and software to enable \nvariations in crop yield to be mapped and crop related treatments to be variably applied \non a site-specific basis.  In reviewing the literature it is apparent the cost of practising \nprecision farming techniques is dependent on: \n 11\n \n(1) the level of technology purchased, i.e. a full or partial system, \n(2) depreciation and current interest rates, and \n(3) the area of crops managed. \nTo determine the realistic cost for UK conditions an analysis was conducted, based on \nprices quoted by main suppliers of precision farming equipment, in January 2001.  It was \napparent that precision farming systems can be split into four main classes, as shown in \nTable 5. \n \nWhere: \nClass 1. Comprises a fully integrated system from an original equipment \nmanufacturer (OEM). \nClass 2. Comprises a full system from a specialist manufacturer.  \nClass 3. Comprises a full system, which is a combination of OEM and specialist \nmanufacturer. \nClass 4. Comprises a basic system \u2013 from an OEM comprising the basic elements \nof a system. \n \nMost new combine harvesters sold in the UK can be fitted with yield mapping \nhardware, however, the degree of integration between the yield mapping system and other \ncomponents of the combine operating and performance monitoring system varies between \nmanufacturers.  The systems range in functionality from fully integrated yield mapping \nand combine performance monitoring systems, that can be removed from the combine \nand fitted to tractors or sprayers and include sub-metre DGPS (Class 1 at \u00a311,363) \nthrough to low cost partial systems that provide full yield mapping functionality but \nreduced application rate control functions (Class 4 at \u00a34,500).  The remaining two classes \n 12\ncomprise, Class 2 (at \u00a314,100) is a full precision farming system produced by specialist \nmanufacturers, and Class 3 (at \u00a316,150) is an addition of parts of Classes 1 and 2 which \ncomprise an OEM integrated yield and combine performance monitor with components \nfrom specialist manufacturers to be mounted in either tractors or spray vehicles for \nvariable application rate control.  This has the added advantage that the parallel systems \nenable both harvesting and application control to be undertaken at the same time. \n \nThe basic system (Class 4 at \u00a34,500), the least cost option, uses a non-differential GPS \nto provide position information to +10 m.  This provides the operator with the capability \nto produce yield maps of a slightly lower resolution than those produced using full \nprecision farming systems, but probably sufficiently accurate for most management tasks.  \nVariable application rates are achieved through changing the tractor forward speed whilst \nmaintaining a constant material flow from the applicator in use.  The speed control is \nachieved by the operator manually attempting to match a target speed displayed on the on \nboard vehicular computer screen.  This provides a limited range over which the \napplication rate can be varied, dependant on the tractor transmission type, but does permit \nfarmers to make initial ventures into precision farming management without a large \ncapital outlay. \n \n3.2 Assumptions used and the basis of the cost calculations \nThe costs are based on the following assumptions: \n(1) one set of variable-application crop treatment equipment, i.e. PF-system, can \u2018farm\u2019 \nan identical area to that harvested by the combine, \n(2) operations involving variable application equipment are not conducted at the same \ntime as combine harvesting (with the exception of class 3), \n 13\n(3) when multiple PF-systems are used the total area would be divided equally between \nunits, and \n(4) the farm office would contain a PC, capable of running yield and application \nmapping software, therefore, no allowance has been made in the following sections, \nfor the purchase of a new PC.  \n \nand comprise of both the capital and associated cost components shown in Table 6. \n \n3.2.1 Combine hardware costs  \nThese reflect the cost of upgrading a new machine, at the time of purchase, from \nstandard specification to a level where yield mapping can be conducted.  This includes \nthe yield mapping system, a DGPS unit and software to enable the production of yield \nmaps using the farm PC.   \n \n3.2.2 Tractor hardware costs  \nCosts include the extra hardware required to upgrade a tractor to allow the fitting of \neither the reprogrammed combine unit or a separate platform, from a specialist \nmanufacturer.  Generally the tractor hardware consists of mounting brackets and wiring \nharnesses to connect the on board vehicular computer to the systems and sensors on the \ntractor i.e. a radar unit for measuring true speed. \n \n3.2.3 Implement hardware costs  \nImplement hardware covers the control systems required to enable application rates to \nbe varied on a site-specific basis according to some predetermined strategy  \ni.e. an application map.  In the case of integrated removable and reprogrammable yield \nmapping systems the implement hardware generally consists of the implement-mounted \n 14\ncontrol units i.e. motors, metering mechanisms and connecting cables. When non-\nreprogrammable yield mapping systems are fitted to the combine, this cost also includes \nthose parts of a control platform required to enable application rates to be varied. \nImplement costs, used in this research, have been calculated using the extra cost incurred \nwhen purchasing a new precision farming equipped model of a particular machine \ncompared to the cost of purchasing the same model in standard configuration.  \n \n3.2.4 Software  \nSoftware is used on the farm PC to process the raw yield data to produce both yield \nmaps and application maps for controlling the application of seed and chemicals on a site-\nspecific basis.  Software is usually included in the price of the hardware supplied for yield \nor application mapping operations and, therefore, is not quoted as a separate cost item in \nthis report.  There are, however, a number of companies that supply different types of \nsoftware, for producing and analysing yield and application maps and typically range in \ncost from being supplied free of charge for determining fertiliser application rates up to \n\u00a32,400 for a complete precision farming management package compatible with a wide \nrange of commercially available systems.  The latter would have a cost of \u00a31.37 ha-1 \nbased upon an area of 500 ha and depreciated over 5 years at an interest rate of 8.5%. \n \n3.2.5 Depreciation of the capital cost  \nDepreciation of the specialist precision farming components has been assumed to be \nequal to the rate of depreciation of the host machine, using those rates given in the Farm \nManagement Pocketbook (Nix, 2000). \n \n 15\n3.2.6 Maintenance costs  \nCost of maintenance of the equipment associated with precision farming is difficult to \nestablish as the equipment is mostly solid state i.e. electronic circuit boards with no \nmoving parts, these components should, therefore, be more reliable than components with \nmany moving parts for instance metering mechanisms.  However, they are mounted in a \nhostile environment that is subjected to vibration, dust, moisture and temperature change, \nwhich increases the risk of failure.  To allow for this a maintenance cost for the precision \nfarming accessories has been calculated using the same percentage of the initial capital \ncost as quoted by Nix (2000) for the regular maintenance of the machine to which the \nequipment is fitted.   \n \n3.2.7 Training costs  \nThese have been based on a figure of \u00a3300, to cover the salary of the trainee during the \ntime of training and the cost course, provided by a leading agricultural machinery \nmanufacturer, amortised over a period of 5 years. \n  \n3.2.8 Cost of capital  \nCapital has been calculated at a rate of 8.5 % pa, i.e. base + 2.5% (Nix, 2000) and \nreflects the cost of the initial investment in the precision farming equipment. \n \n3.3 Precision farming equipment costs \nThe basis of the additional costs associated with purchasing new precision farming \nequipped machinery over the cost of purchasing new non precision farming equipped \nmachinery are summarised in Table 7 for all systems.  From which the annual cost per \nPF-system is then calculated which can then be directly compared to the benefits.  \n \n 16\n3.3.1 Annual cost per unit area  \nThis has been calculated for a range of arable areas that could be managed using a \nsingle PF-system i.e. the vehicle mounted computer used to record yield when fitted to \nthe combine harvester and control application rate when fitted to the tractor.  The results \nof the analysis for a Class 1 system, based upon a total cost of \u00a311,363, is presented in \nFig. 1 for the depreciation of the initial capital cost, the other associated costs are \npresented in Fig. 2. \n \nThese figures show very clearly the effect of the area per PF-system on the annual cost \nof the operation, with the costs becoming asymptotic to the horizontal axis.  The figures \nshow that the other associated costs are greater than the cost of depreciation of the capital \nequipment. \n \n \nThe two data sets have been combined in Fig. 3 to show the total annual cost \u00a3 ha-1 for \nthe range of systems.  Fig. 3 shows that the basic system (Class 4) which is significantly \ncheaper than the full systems is less than \u00a35 ha-1 for areas above 250 ha, where \ncorresponding values for the full systems range between \u00a312 ha-1 and \u00a318 ha-1.  \nObviously doubling the area to 500 ha reduces the cost to \u00a32.50 ha-1 and \u00a36 - \u00a39 ha-1 \nrespectively.  These figures are higher than those quoted by Earl et al. (1996) and James \n(1998), for an area of 250 ha, as they include the additional expense of maintenance and \ntraining, but are lower than those suggested by Schmerler and Basten, (1999) when the \neconomies of scale are considered. \n \n 17\n3.4 Other costs \nA number of other costs can be associated with the management system for precision \nfarming by providing information on which to base application plans. These are as \nfollows: \n \n3.4.1 Soil texture and soil series  \nTexture and soil series can be determined by traditional manual surveying techniques \nfrom auger samples on an approximate 100 m grid basis or the more recently developed \nelectromagnetic induction techniques (Waine, 2000).  These are generally based upon a \ncost per hectare as given in Table 8, and should be viewed as a \u201cone-off\u201d non-recurrent \ninvestment. \n \n3.4.2 Soil nutritional (chemical) status  \nStatus is determined upon a cost per sample, current sampling and analysis costs for a \nrange of nutrients are also given in Table 8.  This indicates that nitrogen analysis is \nexpensive if undertaken annually, with one sample per hectare, and explains why there is \ngreat interest in targeting the samples needed for this and similar analyses as outlined in \nThomas et al. (1999). \n \n3.4.3 Crop canopy status  \nCrop canopy status covers the costs to assist in the management of the crop canopy in \nnear real time using crop reflectance data.  This can be determined using either aerial \ndigital photography (ADP) or tractor mounted radiometers (TMR).   \n \nThe hardware required for obtaining remotely sensed data comprises a pair of digital \ncameras for use in ADP mounted in a light aircraft (Wood et al, 2001b) or a tractor \n 18\nmounted radiometer (Boissard et al., 2001) for collecting near-ground crop reflectance \ndata.  The annual depreciation and maintenance costs, associated with ADP and TMR \nequipment, have been calculated using the same assumptions as used for calculating the \ncosts of other precision farming system hardware in the earlier sections, these costs are \nsummarised in Table 9.  The TMR may also be hired for a season as indicated in Table 9. \n \nFor the farm scales in the UK it is most likely that a service provider, agronomy \nconsulting group or a syndicate of farmers would make the substantial investment \n(c \u00a315,000) in the digital camera system for ADP.  The annual cost of \u00a33,750 would, \ntherefore, be spread over a much larger area than a single farm. \n  \nIn order to estimate the cost per hectare of acquiring the crop reflectance data using \nADP it has been assumed that: \n(i) each 3 hour flight could cover up to 3,650 ha and that each field would \nneed to be photographed prior to each application of nitrogen at the 3 \ngrowth stages in the January \u2013 May period, \n(ii) it is possible to make 2 flights per day, and   \n(iii) weather conditions limit the number of days when images may be \nobtained. \n \nFrom the experience of this project, the most difficult period for flying was during the \nphase in late April early May.  Taking the worst-case scenario weather conditions during \nthis period may permit only 2 days of data collection, however, during this period it \nwould be possible to collect up to 15,000 ha of crop data.   \n \n 19\nThe cost of data collected, per flight as a function of the area per flight is presented in \nFig. 4, this includes the cost of the plane, pilot, cameras and the technicians to perform \nthe image calibration in the field.  It can be seen that the cost is almost independent of the \narea flown above 1000 ha, and at 1500 ha (a typical day\u2019s work for collecting the ground \ncalibration data) would cost \u00a37 ha-1. \n \nThe cost of the tractor-mounted radiometer (TMR) is more likely to be borne by an \nindividual farmer or a small syndicate of farmers.  The TMR could provide similar, but \nlower resolution, data to ADP for use in producing fertiliser application plans.  However, \ncertain models of TMR can be interfaced with the fertiliser distributor to effect real time \nadjustment of nitrogen application rate according to crop reflectance. The cost per ha has \nbeen calculated, as a function of the area managed per radiometer, using the data in Table \n9, and is presented in Fig. 5. \n \nFrom Fig. 5 it can be seen that the rented TMR and the farmer-owned TMR used for \nreal time control of nitrogen application rate have respectively the highest and lowest cost \nper unit area.  The lower cost per unit area of the TMR used for real time control is due to \nthe lower labour requirement for in-field calibration of the radiometer data with the crop \ncanopy in comparison to that required when application maps are to be produced.   \n \nThe difference between owning (\u00a310.75 ha-1) and renting (\u00a313.75 ha-1) a TMR being \n\u00a33 ha-1 at 500 ha, however, to be competitive with ADP it would be necessary to manage \nan area in excess of 1500 ha.  The cost of using a TMR for real time control of nitrogen \napplication rate is \u00a35 ha-1 for an area of 500 ha. \n \n 20\n4 Breakeven analysis \nThe breakeven analysis has been based on a benefit of \u00a315 ha-1.  This has been \ncalculated by subtracting the \u00a37 ha-1 cost of acquiring ADP data from the \u00a322 ha-1 benefit \nachieved by varying nitrogen application according to crop needs assessed using real time \nmonitoring of the canopy in Onion Field and Far Highlands.  In order to estimate the area \nper PF-system required to break even the mean benefit of \u00a315 ha-1 has been compared \nwith the cost of the four different classes of PF-system shown in Fig. 6.   \nIt can be seen from Fig. 6 how the increase in system cost increases the area per PF-\nsystem required for breakeven at an economic return of \u00a315 ha-1, with the exact areas \nshown in Table 10.  The cost of sampling for soil mineral nitrogen has not been factored \ninto this analysis as it is envisaged that it would be conducted as part of an improved \nuniform application strategy, the cost would be prohibitive for a sampling density greater \nthan that accounted for good field practise (MAFF, 2000).  \n \nThis shows for a low cost basic system precision farming can be economically viable \nfor areas in excess of 78 ha, rising to 308 ha for the most expensive system for fields \nresponding in a similar way to Onion Field and Far Highlands.  These areas would have \nto be increased if the TMR was used to collect reflectance data, similar to that from ADP, \nand lower if the TMR was used for \u201creal-time control\u201d. \n \nThe average benefits obtained from managing Far Highlands on a site-specific basis \n(namely \u00a37.75 ha-1) are too low to justify the investment in precision farming equipment \nfor nitrogen management alone, however, combined with other benefits listed in Table 9 \ncould prove worthwhile.   \n  \n 21\n4.1 Other economic benefits \nBenefits of up to \u00a360 ha-1 have been achieved in these field trials (Onion Field) when \nvarying nitrogen application rate according to crop requirements determined through the \nuse of ADP to measure the crop canopy.  However, there are a number of other factors, \nwhich need to be considered.  These factors and their possible economic implications are \nsummarised in Table 11.   \n \n \nDuring the course of this project three examples of the above additional benefits of \nprecision farming were recorded.  The cost of water logging, shown as up to \u00a3195 ha-1, \nwas calculated using a potential yield reduction of 3 t ha-1, experienced at one of the trial \nsites following a wet period in the winter of 1998\/99 (Wood et al., 2000a).  This could \nhave been rectified for a one off cost of \u00a350 ha-1 (Nix, 2000) for re-moling the site and \nclearing blocked drain outlets which could have an economic life in excess of 5 years. \n \nUneven distribution of fertiliser, which had absorbed moisture during transport and \nstorage, resulted in uneven application and a yield penalty of up to 1 t ha-1 during the \nblanket application phase.  This could be corrected by using an alternative source of \nfertiliser and spreader calibration. \n \nThe cost of failing to rectify problems involving pH levels was estimated to be up to \n\u00a37 ha-1, calculated using yield data from one of the trial sites that was affected by sub-\noptimal pH levels.  The collection of these data using yield mapping techniques enables \nsimple cost\/benefit analyses to be conducted to ascertain the scale and extent of the \n 22\nproblem(s), from which estimates of the cost of correction can be made to compare with \nthe potential long term benefits.   \n \nEconomic benefits resulting from the site-specific control of herbicide (Rew et al., \n1997 and Perry et al., 2001) and fungicide (Secher, 1997) application have been included \nin Table 11.  The reported cost savings for herbicides range between \u00a30.50 and \u00a320.70 ha-\n1, and were achieved by targeted application using patch-spraying techniques.  A \nstatistically significant yield increase of 0.3 t ha-1, equivalent to an increase in revenue of \n\u00a321.67 ha-1, has been achieved by varying fungicide application rate according to crop \ncanopy density. \n  \nIt can be seen from Table 11 that the potential economic penalties of problems \nincluding water-logging due to poor drainage, and poor calibration of fertiliser application \nequipment, can outweigh the highest increase in benefit achieved, during this research, \nfrom spatially varying nitrogen fertiliser.  It is, therefore, imperative that the areas \naffected and the potential economic consequences of these problems are addressed prior \nto considering the use of spatially varying nitrogen.  \n \n4.2 Sensitivity analysis of field variability \nThe scale of any benefit obtained from adopting precision farming practices will \nultimately depend on the magnitude of the response and the proportion of the field (%) \nthat will respond positively to variable management.  The increase in yield required to \nbreak even for different levels of field variability has been calculated using the costs \nbased on Class 1 and Class 4 systems and grain at \u00a365 t-1 is shown in Figs 7a and 7b.  The \nproportion of the field (%) responding positively to variable nitrogen management is \n 23\nbased upon data from the shoot density and crop canopy studies, which varied between \n12% and 52% of the strip areas and could be estimated for a particular farm using yield \nmaps. \n \nIt can be seen from Fig. 7 that for:  \n(1) areas per PF-system greater than approximately 250 ha, and  \n(2) areas of the field likely to produce a positive response to site specific \nmanagement, greater than 30%  \nthe response curves are asymptotic to the horizontal axis.  Using these figures as an \nexample shows that minimum yield increases of 1.0 t ha-1 and 0.25 t ha-1 are required for \nbreakeven for the Class 3 (most expensive) and Class 4 (least expensive) systems \nrespectively, larger potential yield benefits would then be profitable. \n \n5 Conclusions \nThese conclusions are based upon nitrogen and cereal prices at \u00a30.30 kg-1 and \u00a365 t-1 \nrespectively, and for equipment prices in the UK in January 2001. \n(1) At the above prices the benefits of the variable rate application of nitrogen, based \nupon crop canopy management using aerial digital photography compared to a \nstandard uniform rate provided an average improvement of \u00a322 ha-1.  This was \nbased upon the results of 8 experimental strips in 2 fields of wheat, with a range of \nseed rates.  The fields were located in Southern and South Eastern England and \nrepresented soils similar to 30% of the arable growing area of England and Wales. \n(2) Applying nitrogen fertiliser based upon the variations in historic yield is not \neconomically justified. \n(3) The capital cost of yield mapping and variable application equipment varies from: \n 24\n(a) a basic PF-system (\u00a34,500) which uses a non-differential GPS system with the \nyield monitor to produce a yield map and a forward speed indicator to advise \nthe operator of the target speed needed to achieve the required application \nrate, to \n(b) a DGPS equipped unit with greater spatial accuracy and automatically \ncontrolled variable application systems ranging in cost from \u00a311,500 to \n\u00a316,000,  depending upon the level of integration and compatibility with \nexisting farm machinery.  The most expensive system permitting both yield \nmapping and spatially variable application to be undertaken concurrently. \n(4) The annual cost per hectare of the above equipment over a 5 year depreciation \nperiod, at an interest rate of 8.5% together with maintenance and training vary \nbetween \u00a34.67 ha-1 and \u00a318.46 ha-1 for the basic and most expensive system \nrespectively for an area managed per PF-system of 250 ha.  These costs will change \nin inverse proportion to the area managed per unit. \n(5) The benefits outweigh the additional costs of the investment in precision farming \nsystems and services for cereal farms greater than 80 ha for basic low cost systems \nand 200 - 300 ha for the range of the more sophisticated systems.  These figures \nalso assume a \u00a37 ha-1 charge for crop canopy images either from aerial or ground \nbased systems. \n(6) The costs of detailed soil analysis prohibit collection from a dense grid of data \npoints and targeted sampling based upon significant variations in yield or soil type \nis recommended. \n(7) Common problems, such as water logging and fertiliser application errors, can \nresult in significant crop yield penalties.  Precision Farming can enable these \nproblems to be identified, the lost revenue to be calculated and the resultant impact \n 25\non the cost\/benefit to be determined.  This provides a basis from which informed \nmanagement decisions can be taken. \n(8) Work carried out by other researchers indicates that savings in herbicide use of the \norder of \u00a30.50 to \u00a320.70 ha-1 can be made. \n(9) Currently ADP appears to be less expensive than TMR for collecting NDVI data, \nhowever, \u201creal time control\u201d of nitrogen based on a TMR system offers the least \ncost option. \n(10) The scale of the benefits obtained from precision farming practices depends upon \nthe magnitude of the response to the corrective\/variable treatments and the \nproportion of the field, which will respond.  Typically a farmed area of 250 ha of \ncereals, where 30% of the area will respond to corrective\/variable treatment requires \nan increase in yield on the responsive areas of between 0.25 t ha-1 and 1.0 t ha-1 for \nthe basic and the most expensive system respectively.  These figures will change in \ninverse proportion to (i) the size of the area managed with each PF-system and (ii) \nthe percentage of the field that will respond to treatment. \n \n6 Acknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank the sponsors of this work, Home-Grown Cereals \nAuthority, Hydro Agri and AGCO Ltd. for their support, and the contributions made by \ntheir collaborators, Arable Research Centres and Shuttleworth Farms.
