The purpose of this study was to enhance this knowledge by exploring an athlete\u201fs \ninjury-related thoughts, sensations and images throughout the recovery process, using a \nprospective, longitudinal design. Method: The participant was a 28-year old male rugby \nplayer who had sustained a severely dislocated shoulder. Eight unstructured interviews were \nconducted over a period of 20 weeks, while a follow-up interview took place three years post \ninjury. The interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and analysed using qualitative analyses \nprocedures. Results and conclusions: Four interdependent themes emerged from the \ninterviews: (a) awareness, (b) mental imagery, (c) mental model of the injury, and (d) mental \n\u201citinerary\u201d of the recovery process. The temporal dynamics of the recovery process were \nevident in the flux of attention-demanding properties of the injury; (dis)appearance of images \nover time; increasing complexity of the mental model; and construction and \u201cconcretisation\u201d \nof the mental itinerary. Furthermore, the role of the athlete\u201fs desired self-concept in shaping \nhis inferences, actions and emotions, emerged as a fifth theme. The findings were synthesised \ninto a \u201cmulti-track\u201d conceptualisation of the athlete\u201fs covert and overt injury-related activities \nover time.  \n \n   Exploring Mental Representation     3 \nExploring the Mental Representation of Athletic Injury:  \nA Longitudinal Case Study. \nPsychological reactions to sports injury have received increasing attention from \nresearchers in the last 15 years (for reviews see Brewer, 1994; Evans & Hardy, 1995; Wiese-\nBjornstal, Smith, Shaffer, & Morrey, 1998). Studies have shown a variety of reactions, most \nindicating emotional upheaval (e.g., disbelief, frustration, perturbation), as well as a range of \ncognitive and behavioural coping strategies (Bianco, Malo & Orlick, 1999; Udry, Gould, \nBridges, & Beck, 1997). There are also indications that emotional distress diminishes over \ntime as recovery progresses (Evans & Hardy, 2002; McDonald & Hardy, 1990).  \nEmotions are not the only psychological reactions to injury, however. As Udry et al. \n(1997) found, \u201cinjury-relevant information processing\u201d also forms a substantial component of \nathletes\u201f reactions to injury, but research on this component has thus far been limited.  Udry \net al. (1997) reported experiencing pain, awareness of injury severity, questioning, and \nrecognizing negative consequences as the higher order themes making up injury-relevant \ninformation processing. Their analysis focused on athletes\u201f immediate reactions to their \ninjury though, and did not include a more longitudinal or extensive exploration of this \ncomponent.  \nIn an attempt to shed some light on the nature, role, antecedents and consequences of \ninjury-relevant information processing, this paper describes the results of a case study that \nfocused on an athlete\u201fs mental representation of his injury over time.  The study aimed to \nexplore any dimensions along which information about the injury was organised in the \nathlete\u201fs mind, and how these changed throughout the recovery process. A particular interest \nwas directed at the nature of any injury-related images that would form part of the mental \nrepresentation, as some forms of imagery advocated for and used by injured athletes, such as \nhealing imagery (visualizing the internal healing process, Ievleva & Orlick, 1991; Sordoni, \n   Exploring Mental Representation     4 \nHall, & Forwell, 2002), and rehabilitation imagery (visualizing oneself progressing \nsuccessfully through rehabilitation, Green, 1992), would require a visual and\/or kinaesthetic \nrepresentation of the injury or injured body part,  but research into the nature of injury-related \nimages is still scant. The study employed a qualitative, prospective and longitudinal design, \nconsisting of a series of interviews with a severely injured rugby player. By examining the \nexperiences of one athlete, in-depth and over time, it was hoped that a holistic perspective of \nthe mental representation could be gained, which might then serve as a framework for further \ninvestigation of injury-relevant information processing. \nMethod \nThe participant in the study was a 28-year old rugby player who sustained a severe \ndislocation of his right shoulder during a match in late February. At the time of the injury he \nwas in his final year of a sports science degree at a university in the north of England. The \nplayer, Aidan (not his real name), had been involved in competitive rugby League for 12 \nyears, 8 of which at semi-professional level. When the injury occurred he had taken a year \nout from semi-professional rugby and was playing in a lower division regional game. It was \nhis first-ever shoulder injury, although he had sustained a number of other previous injuries. \n Eight interviews, varying between 45 and 105 minutes in duration, were conducted \nover a period of 20 weeks. The interviews took place at 21, 35, 42, 63, 77, 91, 112, and 156 \ndays post injury, respectively. A follow-up interview was also conducted at three years post \ninjury. All interviews were conducted by the author, who was known to Aidan as a member \nof the lecturing staff on his degree programme. However, the author was not involved in any \ndirect teaching or assessment for the remainder of his programme and throughout the \nduration of the study. Hence, there was a relationship of familiarity and trust but not of \ndependence. Aidan was assured of anonymity and confidentiality, and signed an informed \nconsent form prior to commencement of the interviews. The interviews were conducted in the \n   Exploring Mental Representation     5 \nauthor\u201fs office. Dates were selected in part to allow for medical visits in between interviews, \nand in part to fit in with Aidan\u201fs timetable.  The follow-up interview was arranged after a \nchance-encounter three years after Aidan left university, and was used to determine the long-\nterm effects of the injury, and to check the state of his mental representation at that time. \nThe interviews were open-ended and semi-structured in nature (Smith, 1995). In each \ninterview, Aidan was asked to describe what had happened in the preceding weeks in relation \nto his injury as this provided the context in which information about the injury would be \nprocessed. Probes were then used to elicit descriptions of any injury-related sensations, \nthoughts and images throughout this period.  This resulted in an exploration of topics that \nwere salient in his mind at the time of that interview, but with exploration of related \nsensations, thoughts and images. Occasionally, when Aidan did not spontaneously refer to an \nissue that had been salient during the previous interview, the interviewer would inquire what \nhis current experiences with that issue were. Both the data collection and data analysis were \ninformed by the author\u201fs personal background, which included degrees in psychology, \ncognitive social psychology, and sport psychology, training in qualitative research and \ncounselling, and particular familiarity with the areas of mental imagery and psychology of \nsports injury.  \nAnalysis \nThe interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. Due to practical limitations in time \nand resources, the main analysis took place after the first 8 interviews had been completed. \nThe data were analysed inductively, using procedures common in qualitative analysis \n(Henwood, 1996; Smith, 1995). Following a process of open coding (Strauss, 1987) in which \ndata were scrutinised very closely and basic questions were asked regarding what each \nstatement could be indicating, a process of focused coding was implemented, in which the \nmost relevant open codes were used to code larger chunks of text (Charmaz, 1995a). The \n   Exploring Mental Representation     6 \nlatter were subsequently grouped together and studied in more depth, with particular attention \npaid to changes over time. Regular memo writing was employed during data analysis to keep \ntrack of and elaborate emerging analytical insights (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Results and \ninsights were also regularly discussed with a colleague\n1 \nwho acted as peer debriefer (Lincoln, \n& Guba, 1985). Although the analysis contained elements of grounded theory, this was not \nintended to be a full-scale grounded theory study. The purpose was merely to identify \nelements and highlight possible relationships that could enhance our understanding of the \ninformation-processing reactions to injury and inform future research. \nThe results are presented below in the following manner. First, a chronological outline \nof events, including some impressions of emotions as they shone through in the interviews, \nwill be presented to provide a contextual perspective. This will be followed by a description \nof the main themes that emerged from the interviews.  In the final section, a further \ninterpretation of the themes is sought through links with relevant literature and integration \ninto a tentative conceptual model.  \nResults \nContext of the Recovery Process \nThe day after incurring the injury, Aidan saw a specialist in the hospital who told him \nthat there was a 70% chance of reoccurrence and that he might never play rugby again, which \nwas very distressing news to him. By the time of the first interview (week 3), Aidan had not \nhad any more medical appointments, nor any treatment, and was still wearing his arm in a \nsling. As the injury was to his dominant arm, it incapacitated him considerably. Between the \nfirst and second interview, Aidan received some further distressing news during a hospital \nvisit, suggesting that the numbness he was experiencing could be a sign of nerve damage and \nmight jeopardise his plans of joining the police force. However, a couple of days later, an \ninformal consultation with one of his lecturers (\u201cMark\u201d, a physiotherapist), laid to rest some \n   Exploring Mental Representation     7 \nof these fears, as Mark explained the distinction between different types of nerve damage and \nconveyed his impression that it was probably not serious. By week 5 (interview 2), Aidan still \nhad virtually no mobility or functional use of his arm, and did basic home-based exercises to \nstabilise the joint. He also attended regular physiotherapy sessions with N.H.S.\n2  \ntherapists, \nand some with Mark, which continued throughout the study. By week 6 (interview 3), he had \na lot more movement in his shoulder, but still no strength or functional use.  \nDuring this time Aidan also consulted a specialist in his home county whom he knew \nfrom his days as a semi-professional rugby player. This specialist showed disappointment \nwith Aidan\u201fs progress and concluded that the injury might have entailed more than a basic \ndislocation. Aidan\u201fs reaction to this event was \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d, concluding that the injury \nwas more serious than he thought. By week 9 (interview 4), he reported continued \nimprovement in range of motion, and some small improvement in strength. He performed \nexercises and stretches 8 to10 times a day at this time. By week 11 (interview 5), he had \nstarted going to the gym, where he did rehabilitation exercises as well as cycling and running. \nHe recounted that his shoulder was sore after a night out drinking and dancing.  \nFollowing this interview, Aidan became very busy with his exams, only attended one \nphysiotherapy session, did little home-based rehabilitation and did not go to the gym at all. In \nweek 13 (interview 6), he said he felt that progress had \u201cpetered out\u201d because of his lack of \ncommitment to his rehabilitation. He concluded that his shoulder was \u201csomewhat stronger\u201d \nthough, as it was not sore after a rather rough night out, and he fully anticipated returning to \nhis rehabilitation regime in the coming weeks. Despite these intentions, however, by week 16 \n(interview 7), he still had done relatively little, due to the pressure of writing his dissertation. \nDuring this time he also visited a sports physiotherapist in his home county, who told him \nthat he was \u201ccheating\u201d by using inappropriate muscles to lift his arm, and gave him a number \nof \u201cback to basics\u201d exercises to work the proper muscles. However, although he clearly \n   Exploring Mental Representation     8 \nacknowledged the necessity of the exercises, he did not do them because he considered them \nboring. He did nevertheless use his shoulder considerably in other activities, in particular \nswimming and manual work in a summer job. He also returned to, somewhat modified, rugby \ntraining, though not to competition. By week 22 (interview 8), he was still limited in the \nexercises he could do, and his shoulder still felt stiff and somewhat sore when lifting his arm \nabove his head.  \nThree years later, in the follow-up interview, Aidan reported that he had regained full \nuse of his shoulder for everyday and fitness activities, but that the injury had ended his rugby \ncareer. He had not joined the police force, though for reasons unrelated to the injury. Overall, \nhe was quite content with his life and level of activity. \nThemes \nFour themes depicting interdependent dimensions of injury mental representation \nemerged from the interviews: (a) awareness, (b) mental imagery, (c) mental model of the \ninjury, and (d) mental \u201citinerary\u201d of the future. A fifth theme emphasising the importance of \nthe athlete\u201fs desired self-concept was also identified. The temporal dynamics of the recovery \nprocess were evident in the flux of attention-demanding properties of the injury; \n(dis)appearance of images over time; increasing complexity of the mental model; \nconstruction and \u201cconcretisation\u201d of the mental itinerary; and adjustment of the desired \nphysical self.  \nAwareness  \nThe awareness dimension represented the extent to and way in which the injury \ndominated Aidan\u201fs awareness over time. Because pain and discomfort demanded attention, \nthey brought the injury into awareness. As these attention-demanding properties of the injury \ndiminished over time, awareness gradually diminished. Over the course of the study, \nawareness changed from being \u201clike a constant strain, all of the time\u201d (interview 2) to being \n   Exploring Mental Representation     9 \nalmost absent. The changes over time were also reflected in gradual changes in the intensity \nor levels of awareness. When pain did no longer act as a constant reminder of the damage, \nreinforcing the need to be careful, there still needed to be a level of semi-awareness that \nwould prompt him to be cautious when initiating movements for which the tissue was not \nready. For example, in interview 7 he noted \u201cA lot of the time I\u201fm aware I\u201fve got to make an \neffort to actually lean over and pick things up because of the restrictions I\u201fve got.\u201d This semi-\nawareness did not seem to be foolproof, however, as it could slip sometimes when he would \nforget having a \u201cdodgy shoulder\u201d and inadvertently engage in an action for which the tissue \nwas not ready.  This first started happening around the time of interview 3, when he indicated \nthat he would get \u201ca wee bit more careless, as the days go by \u2026\u201d, and continued throughout \nthe study, although the number of occasions where cautiousness was necessary gradually \ndiminished. When he did experience pain after unthinkingly engaging in movements, this \ntended to re-activate his level of awareness: \u201cSometimes I do it subconsciously, but then it \nhurts and you\u201fre made aware, then when you go and do the same thing again, you do it so it \ndoesn\u201ft hurt as much\u201d 3 (interview 7). \nIn addition to the non-deliberate awareness of the injury resulting from pain or \nsoreness, and the somewhat deliberate semi-awareness he experienced, Aidan also reported \nmoments when he purposefully brought the injury into awareness during times when \nawareness was generally low or absent. These happened when he \u201ctried out\u201d new \nmovements, and when he engaged in rehabilitation exercises, which he knew would cause \npain but were essential for proper recovery. This deliberate seeking of pain for rehabilitation \npurposes appeared to become harder over time as periods of non-awareness started to \ndominate. For example, in interview 8 he commented \n   Exploring Mental Representation     10 \nI\u201fm not getting any pain as much.  Maybe I\u201fm not pushing, maybe that\u201fs why I need \nto see Mark again, he used to push you so you were going through the pain barrier, \nbut I haven\u201ft been doing that in the last couple of weeks. Generally it feels quite fine.  \nOverall, the awareness dimension included a dynamic flux of states of non-deliberate \nawareness, non-awareness, semi-awareness, and deliberate awareness, shifting in magnitude \nacross time. \nMental Imagery \nAidan reported a variety of body-related mental images, which either occurred \nspontaneously or were conjured up more intentionally in the pursuit of recovery.  \nInvoluntary replay images. \nDuring the first interview, Aidan reported that he frequently experienced replay \nimages of the accident. These images appeared mostly at times when his mind was \u201cidle\u201d, \nwere experienced as \u201cquite disturbing\u201d, and he had to make an effort to get them out of his \nmind. The images closely resembled the actual situation in which the injury took place, \nthough he tended to see himself in slow motion, and mostly from an outside perspective. \nFurthermore, there was an additional visual image attached to the picture that represented the \nsensation he had experienced at the time of the accident, namely that his arm was only \nattached by the skin. He described how he saw himself \u201c\u2026 as if somebody was looking at it \nfrom the sidelines and they could pick my hand up and just wave my arm about with no \nresistance whatsoever\u201d. By interview 2, the frequency of replay images had greatly \ndiminished. The quality of the images had also changed in that they had become less intense, \nmilder and more fleeting. By interview 3, the images had virtually disappeared.  \nImages associated with physical sensations. \nSome of the images that Aidan reported were associated with particular physical \nsensations, and seemed to serve the purpose of explaining or giving meaning to these \n   Exploring Mental Representation     11 \nsensations. An interesting example is the only visual image of the inside of his shoulder that \nhe experienced during the study. This image initially appeared in week 6, in response to a \nphysiotherapist\u201fs explanation that detailed how, when the injury occurred, \u201cthe head of the \nhumerus came right through and ripped the muscle fibres apart, the muscles at the front of the \nshoulder\u2026\u201d (interview 3). This explanation triggered the occurrence of a dynamic visual \nimage, representing the movement of the bone \u201cripping\u201d through the muscles, and helped \nAidan\u201fs understanding of what had happened inside his shoulder. Once the image existed, \nAidan then invoked it in subsequent weeks to help interpret impingement sensations that he \nexperienced during exercises in the gym: \nI get the picture, it\u201fs like the head of the humerus is touching them or trying to break \nthrough and that\u201fs what\u201fs causing that feeling [of impingement]. The sharp pain I get \n\u2026. I visualise the head of the humerus trying to work its way out. (interview 4) \nOver time, the occurrence of the image decreased as the frequency and intensity of the \nimpingement sensations diminished. During the last three interviews, no more mention was \nmade of this image occurring, and by the time of the follow-up interview, Aidan could not \neven remember having this image. \nImages of the injured shoulder being healthy (again). \nDuring the first four interviews, Aidan repeatedly reported that he often experienced \nimages in which he saw himself making full(er) use of his shoulder. These images were \ncommonly triggered by feelings of frustration and by the desire to use his shoulder again, as \nhe had been able to in the past. They were prompted in particular when he did something with \nhis healthy arm that the injured arm could not do. Later in the study, these images of \nfunctional use occurred mostly in the gym environment, and were then often conjured up \nmore deliberately than the images that he experienced earlier. They involved imaging the \ninjured arm copying the movements that the healthy arm had just completed. Aidan often \n   Exploring Mental Representation     12 \ncommented that he would \u201cknow that I used to be able to do it\u2026 [ ]. So I remember how I \nused to be when I do these things and that\u201fs how I portray it when I\u201fm doing my exercises\u201d \n(interview 7).  Interestingly, although these images were based on the memory of past \nactivities, they were predominantly visual and generally involved an external perspective: \n\u201cThat\u201fs an external picture, I see myself from the outside or standing next to me, lying on a \ntable, extending my arm fully to what my other shoulder can do\u201d (interview 6).   \nHealing imagery. \nHealing imagery was not something Aidan engaged in during his recovery. The \ntechnique was briefly discussed in the first interview\n4\n, where it emerged Aidan was \nunfamiliar with the idea, and, once explained, indicated that he would find it difficult to \ncreate healing images. He argued that this was because he did not actually have an internal \npicture of his shoulder, partly because the injury was complex and partly because he felt he \nlacked visual information about the inside of his shoulder. He also felt that he did not have \nthe physiological knowledge necessary to envisage the healing process. Although he was \nmoderately positive about the possible effect of healing imagery, he did not show much \nintention to try it himself, and, as emerged in the subsequent interviews, did not use it during \nhis rehabilitation.\n  Even after acquiring the \u201chead-of-the-humerus\u201d internal image, this did not \nprompt him to start creating healing images.  \nMental Model  \nThe mental model dimension represented Aidan\u201fs conceptions of the state of the \ninjury and the consequences associated with it. It included perceptions and interpretations of \nsymptoms, appraisals of progress, and inferences about implications, processes that continued \nthroughout the entire period of the study. Over time, the mental model increased in \ncomplexity to accommodate changes in sensory experiences and newly available \nexplanations.   \n   Exploring Mental Representation     13 \nConstitution of the mental model. \nInput into the mental model came from two sources: interactions with medical \npersonnel, and Aidan\u201fs own bodily experiences. The latter included in particular perceiving \npain or other kinaesthetic sensations, and apperceiving the range of movement and functional \nuse of the arm. They also included looking in the mirror and touching the injured area, which \nwere activities he engaged in frequently. Both sources, medical and personal, remained \nimportant in shaping his mental model throughout the study. \nFor quite some time, 5 to 6 weeks, Aidan was mostly concerned with ascertaining the \nextent of the damage done and the long-term implications of the injury, interpreting a whole \nrange of bodily experiences and evaluating medical speculations about the effect on his \nathletic and professional careers. After this period, his main focus shifted to estimates of \nprogress. Initially, he inferred progress mainly from a reduction in the intensity and duration \nof pain, but gradually his inferences became based on a complex interaction between pain, \nthe type of activity undertaken, and the amount of effort put into that activity.  \nLike the pain you felt the week before doing that movement, doing the same \nmovement the following week the pain is not that sore even though you\u201fre doing \nexactly the same thing.  But then you progress the pain again because you go even \nfurther, [ ] you see it and feel it, you feel less pain doing a certain movement, from the \nprevious week and that means to me improvement. (interview 5) \nCommunication with medical staff at this time was important in that he relied on this to \nsupport his personal inferences of progress. Furthermore, he inferred progress from \nphysiotherapy sessions with Mark, as these gave him a sense that he was doing the right \nthings to help his recovery along. \nI come out sweating and it feels like I\u201fve actually done a fitness session, \u201ecause it\u201fs \nhard work and it\u201fs sore and I go through a lot of pain, and I think you need to go \n   Exploring Mental Representation     14 \nthrough pain barriers and cross the threshold to start gaining improvements. \n(interview 5)  \nIntegrating information from different sources. \nThe multi-source input on which his mental model relied sometimes led to confusion \nor worry when there were inconsistencies in the various messages. These could occur \nbetween different personal sources (e.g., \u201cI do feel it\u201fs slightly stronger, but when I look in \nthe mirror I always feel there\u201fs something not right\u201d, interview 4); between personal and \nmedical sources (e.g., \u201cMy shoulder is all over the place. But I have asked Mark and I have \nasked the physio about it, and they don\u201ft seem to be that bothered about why my shoulder\u201fs \nthree inches higher than the other one\u201d, interview 4), or between different medical sources \n(e.g., \u201cdifferent opinions all over\u201d, interview 5).  \nWhen Aidan encountered worrying information he used every opportunity to resolve \nthe issue that disconcerted him. Usually this meant trying to find out more or better \ninformation from different medical practitioners. This, however, increased the risk of \nencountering confusing or inconsistent information, as happened several times during the \nstudy.  \nTemporal aspects. \nThe temporal characteristics of Aidan\u201fs mental model manifested themselves in \nincreases in complexity over time. On the one hand, these increases showed in sharper \ndifferentiations in the perception and interpretation of symptoms, such as the different types \nof pain Aidan described throughout the study (e.g, \u201cslow, stretching pain you\u201fre in control \nof\u201d, associated with rehabilitation exercises, versus \u201csharp, sudden pain, that you worry about \nmore\u201d, associated with inadvertent movements, interview 5). On the other hand, they showed \nin the incorporation of new explanations, which enriched the model by providing new \ninsights and frameworks for attaching new information or sensations. For example, following \n   Exploring Mental Representation     15 \na hospital visit, the idea of nerve damage became part of Aidan\u201fs mental model (interview 2), \nand led to worry. But the notion became differentiated after Mark\u201fs explanation of the \ndifference between sensory and motor nerve damage, and led to relief when Mark indicated \nthat the nerve damage was probably sensory. In a subsequent interview, however, Aidan \nstarted to link his lack of strength to the possibility of motor nerve damage, hence, connecting \nthe explanation with different symptoms. This then became another source of worry. \nBy increasing the complexity of his mental model, Aidan was able to form a relatively \ncomprehensive and differentiated representation of the state of the injury: \nWhen I look in the mirror, it\u201fs still out of line with the other.  It\u201fs not symmetrical yet, \nit\u201fs a different height or a different angle to what it should be. Other muscles are over-\ncompensating; the muscle that should be working to its full potential isn\u201ft.  Hence the \nreason why it\u201fs at a different angle or a different height to my good left shoulder [ ].  I \ndon\u201ft feel anything, I can do things. So I\u201fm not as conscious about it anymore, until I \nactually see it in the mirror, and then I\u201fll remember that I\u201fve got a really bad injury. \n(interview 8) \nMental Itinerary  \nThe mental \u201citinerary\u201d refers to Aidan\u201fs conception of the route to recovery. This \nconception resembled a traveller\u201fs itinerary of a journey, including such elements as the \n\u201cdestination\u201d (quality and time of eventual recovery), \u201cservice stations\u201d (appointments with \nmedical practitioners), \u201cmilestones\u201d (physical signs of improvement), and \u201ctransportation\u201d \n(types of treatment needed). \nDestination: quality and time of eventual recovery. \nBoth the quality and timing of Aidan\u201fs eventual recovery remained uncertain \nthroughout the whole period of the study. He accepted quite early on that his recovery was \ngoing to be a \u201clong, hard, slow process\u201d(interview 4), and he never attached a specific time \n   Exploring Mental Representation     16 \nline to his recovery. When asked if he had any expectations about his recovery he tended to \nsay he did not know and push it into an indefinite future. Even in interview 8 he still \nexpressed uncertainty about the outcome:  \nI don\u201ft know if I\u201fll ever play again [ ] It has got better, but is it going to fully recover? \nI don\u201ft really know that, ask me in December, I think, in December [5 months away] \nI\u201fll have a much better idea of how good it\u201fs going to be.  \nWhether the uncertainty was justified from a medical perspective was impossible for the \ninterviewer to gauge, but it was clear that Aidan accepted a level of uncertainty about the \nfinal outcome throughout the duration of the study. This may have been a double-edged \nsword, as one the on hand it kept his hopes alive, on the other, it left him pre-occupied with \nany indicators of the final outcome, negative or positive. Conflicting or disheartening \ninformation from medics and discrepancies in his own observations all undermined his \nconfidence in the possibility of reaching the desired endpoint. At the same time, he used all \npossible indicators to support a belief in the possibility of full recovery, as was evident in his \ncontinual efforts to find more suitable medical care, and his frequent checking and prodding \nof the injured area for progress. Finding positive indicators buoyed his spirits: \u201cI\u201fm just a lot \nmore optimistic once I\u201fve seen Mark, just the way he is, the way he seems to think \neverything\u201fs going quite well, it perks me up a lot\u201d (interview 5).  \nService stations: medical appointments.  \nThroughout the study, Aidan had a series of appointments with medical personnel, \nsome available to him through regular N.H.S. services, some sought out by him through \npersonal connections. Even though he repeatedly commented that the treatment received via \nthe N.H.S. was of very limited value to him, he attended all the scheduled appointments. The \nmedical appointments served a range of purposes. For example, in interview 2 he declared: \u201cI \nwant a physio, I need a physio; until I get the physio then I don\u201ft really know what\u201fs going to \n   Exploring Mental Representation     17 \nhappen\u201d, expressing both the need to specify the elements of his itinerary and the importance \nof medical information in the construction of this itinerary. Appointments with specialists \nwere anticipated as opportunities to ask questions, get referred to physiotherapy, or obtain a \nsecond opinion. Appointments with physiotherapists served as opportunities to gauge the \nextent and nature of the rehabilitation process, receive new exercises to work on, attain \npermission to engage in new activities, and seek reassurance about progress: \u201cHopefully the \nphysio will see an improvement on Monday in my arm and then I hope Mark sees an \nimprovement when I see him\u201d (interview 5). Later in the study, after the lapse during his \nexam time, Aidan also anticipated the appointments as an impetus to start working hard \nagain.  \nIn general, the medical appointments seemed to have an important function in \nstructuring Aidan\u201fs mental itinerary, perhaps because they were the only aspects that \nnaturally had a specific time attached to them. \nMilestones: physical signs of improvement. \nOn several occasions, Aidan mentioned milestones that he regarded as indicators of \ngood recovery and was looking forward to reaching, for example, lifting a very light weight \n(interview 2), getting back in the gym (interview 3), or moving his arm unassisted above his \nhead (interview 8). The most frequently mentioned milestone was regaining his muscle bulk, \nwhich he saw as a sign that he was on the right track and might reach his desired destination: \n\u201cStill more or less that I get back to the way I was hopefully; that will be when I realise I get \nthe bulk back\u201d (interview 3). As with the final destination, Aidan generally had no specific \nexpectations about the times when he might reach these milestones.  \nTransportation: types of treatment.  \nBased on his previous experiences with injury and knowledge gained from his degree, \nAidan had general expectations about the rehabilitation process, but he needed the input from \n   Exploring Mental Representation     18 \nthe physiotherapists to know exactly which exercises he needed to do, and when to move \nfrom one type of activity to the next. Aidan\u201fs intention to engage in rehabilitation exercises \nwas strong throughout, even during the time when the pressure of his study was high and he \nhad neglected his exercises. His perceptions of the exercises were also clearly linked with \nevaluations of enjoyment, and with beliefs and feelings about their efficacy. These, in turn, \nappeared to play a role in his adherence to them. For example, early in the study, he described \nstability exercises as \u201cthe boring stuff; the stuff where you feel like you\u201fre not doing \nanything\u201d. Nevertheless, he adhered to them because he saw them as essential. At the same \ntime, he was hoping to get permission to start doing exercises in the swimming pool, because  \n\u2026then you know it\u201fs happening, it\u201fs starting to work, you feel like you\u201fre doing \nsomething. At the moment, the only two exercises you get, you don\u201ft feel like they\u201fre \ndoing any good.  You wait to start doing something that you feel is doing some good, \nswimming pools, all these movements, just build up\u2026 (interview 2) \nInterestingly, although he adhered to the boring exercises early on in his rehabilitation, he \nneglected to do so later on, after he was told to \u201creturn to basics\u201d (interview 7), despite fully \nacknowledging the necessity of the exercises. He preferred to engage in more general \nphysical activities, like swimming or touch-rugby, which he enjoyed because they gave him a \nsense of work-out.  \nTemporal aspects. \nIn summary, the mental itinerary represented a dynamic map of images and plans at \nvarying levels of specificity. As a temporal characteristic of this dimension, anticipated \nevents \u201cconcretised\u201d over time, turning into actual experiences and then memories, thereby \nproviding the basis for new expectations and plans. It did not seem possible to have a mental \npicture of the complete route to recovery at the start. There were general expectations, but \n   Exploring Mental Representation     19 \nmore detailed expectations often needed input from a physiotherapist and tended to be filled \nin up to a few weeks in advance. \nRole of desired or ideal self \nA strong pre-occupation for Aidan throughout the study, evident in his focus when \nlooking in the mirror and touching the injured area, the inferences he made, the signs of \nrecovery that he set himself as milestones, and his images of being healthy again, was the loss \nof muscle mass and any progress made towards regaining it. Aidan several times explained \nthe reason for this importance as the necessity to be strong as a rugby player, something that \nhe had been used to for many years.  \nHow much bulk and weight I\u201fve lost, to me that\u201fs a big issue.  Because I\u201fve always \n\u2026.., because of the position I play in rugby, you need to have that vision of \u201eI\u201fm big, \nI\u201fm strong\u201f, because if you\u201fre not bigger and stronger than your opponent then you\u201fre \nin for a hard time when you play rugby.  It\u201fs just an image I\u201fve got all the time when I \ngo into the gym, I want to lift the heavy weights, keep my strength up for the rugby \netc,  that\u201fs where that all stems from. (interview 2) \nThese comments indicated that being muscular and powerful formed a significant aspect of \nhis desired or ideal physical self. As a consequence of the injury there was a huge \ndiscrepancy between his current and desired self, and this discrepancy appeared to have a \nstrong impact on his perceptions and actions. In the later stages of the study, however, as a \nreturn to competitive rugby remained uncertain (and eventually became impossible), this \ndesired self-image seemed to gradually be replaced by an image of \u201cmerely\u201d being a \nphysically fit and active person. \nIntegration and discussion \nIt was evident that the five identified themes were interdependent, and also, as filtered \nthrough in the interviews, inextricably linked to emotions and behaviours.  In reflecting on \n   Exploring Mental Representation     20 \nthese themes and their interrelationships, it seems useful to conceptualise an injured athlete\u201fs \ncovert and overt activities during recovery as a \u201cmulti-track process\u201d (Figure 1). The various \nthemes and their longitudinal manifestations may be seen as occupying different \u201ctracks\u201d that \nexist and evolve simultaneously over time, frequently interacting and affecting one another, \nbut also at times merely existing concurrently.  \nAwareness is closely, though not necessarily categorically or diametrically, linked to \nthe injury\u201fs physiological state of damage and healing, and therefore bound to change over \ntime in accordance with tissue healing. Without physical damage or malfunctioning, we tend \nnot to be aware of specific body parts, and experience our bodies as indelible and \nunproblematic parts of ourselves, a state that has been termed \u201cprimary immediacy\u201d (Gadow, \n1982; Kleiber, Brock, Lee, Dattilo, & Caldwell, 1995; Sparkes, 1998). In this unproblematic \nstate, the body \u201cdisappears from consciousness\u201d (Leder, 1990). Injury brings the body into \nawareness, creating a state of \u201cdisrupted immediacy\u201d (Gadow, 1982). The awareness track \nrepresents the processes by which the experience of the body gradually returns to a state of \nprimary immediacy. These processes entail a constant flux in states of awareness. \nFurthermore, there are times when there may be a sense of non-awareness while nevertheless \na semi-awareness is needed to avoid engaging in activities for which the tissue is not ready, \nand there are times when non-awareness has become so dominant that deliberate and \npurposeful effort is needed to stimulate the awareness necessary to engage in rehabilitation \nexercises. Aidan\u201fs experiences suggest that this flux in awareness is linked to adherence \nbehaviour, as non-deliberate awareness acts as a reminder of the need for rehabilitation \nexercises, whereas in periods of non-awareness, these reminders need to be more deliberately \nsought from other sources. \nThe ideal or desired physical self appears to have a strong motivational effect on \nactions, inferences (mental model), and emotions. In the sociological and health literature, \n   Exploring Mental Representation     21 \nthis effect has been linked to the importance of physical functioning for the attainment of \ndesired identities (Charmaz, 1994, 1995b; Sparkes, 1998). While an unproblematic physical \nself allows the person to strive for, manifest and maintain various personal identities, a \nproblematic physical self will interfere with achieving these identities. In Aidan\u201fs case, his \ndesired physical selves were the ones necessary to recapture his pre-injury athletic identity \nand to achieve the professional identity of a police officer, with a shift near the end of the \nstudy towards the self needed for the identity of a physically fit and active person.  \nThe motivational effects of the desired physical self were noticeable throughout the \nstudy, especially when there was significant discrepancy between the present and desired \nphysical self. The motivational and emotional effects of discrepancies between current and \nideal or feared selves have been extensively described in the cognitive social psychology \nliterature (Higgins, 1987, 1996a). This literature also emphasises the need for activation of \nthe discrepancy in order for the effects to occur (Higgins, 1996b). Linking this to injury, it is \nlikely that awareness has the effect of priming the discrepancy between current and ideal or \nfeared selves, thereby activating the associated motivational tendencies (Higgins, 1987; \n1996b; Karniol & Ross, 1996). Aidan\u201fs experiences further suggest that there is a strong \n\u201cpull\u201d from the possibility to engage in activities that contribute to a sense of the desired \nphysical self (e.g., swimming, running, a physiotherapy session that makes one sweat) that \nmay override the choice of activities that depend on rational decisions (e.g., doing necessary \nbut \u201cboring\u201d exercises involving only small movements), in particular once the injury has \nhealed sufficiently to enable engagement in other activities. It may be that as long as \nrehabilitation exercises are seen as the only available strategies to achieving the desired \nphysical self, triggered motivational tendencies are likely to stimulate adherence to these \nexercises. As soon as other strategies become available, however, rehabilitation exercises \nmay have to compete against these activities. \n   Exploring Mental Representation     22 \nAidan\u201fs need to create at least a rudimentary mental itinerary was evident early on in \nthe recovery process, and it was clear that the content and specificity of his itinerary had \nimplications for the way in which he felt and acted. Indirectly, some studies have implicated \nthat having a comprehensive and specific mental itinerary, in the form of clear information, \ngoals and guidelines regarding rehabilitation, may be associated with lower risks of \npsychosocial problems (Johnson, 1997), better adherence (Pizzari, McBurney, Taylor, & \nFeller, 2002), and faster recovery (Ievleva & Orlick, 1991), hence affecting emotions, \nbehaviours and physical progress. Mental itineraries are not in themselves plans, but they \nmay form the basis for creating action plans for the future, and thereby help in overcoming \nvolitional problems (Gollwitzer, 1996). How specific the mental itinerary needs to be in order \nto allow for effective goal setting and planning at various stages of the recovery process is \nsomething to investigate in future research. Construction of a mental itinerary is clearly \ndependent on medical input. At the same time, it appears that medical appointments \nthemselves have a structuring function in the athlete\u201fs itinerary, as they may be the only goals \nthat are fixed in time, and often enable the athlete to fill in details for the next leg of the \njourney.  \nThe concept of mental models is well-known in the literature on reasoning and \ndecision making (Johnson-Laird, 1983; Legrenzi, Girotto, & Johnson-Laird, 1993), where \nthey usually refer to the mental representation that people construct and consult in their \nattempts to solve a problem. In this study, construction of a mental model was an inevitable \nby-product of Aidan\u201fs attempt to make sense of his injury-related bodily experiences and any \nmedical explanations he received. Because of the involvement of self, athletes\u201f mental \nmodels of their injuries are likely to be rather different from medical conceptions of the \ninjuries. Although fed by accurate medical information, an athlete\u201fs mental model, and any \nactivities used in constructing it, is also based on information derived from (repeated) \n   Exploring Mental Representation     23 \npersonal observation of symptoms, and this study indicates that the attention to and \ninterpretation of symptoms is strongly guided by the athlete\u201fs desired physical self.  \nIn models of psychological reactions to injury, emotions are commonly seen as \nresulting from athletes\u201f appraisal of the injury, i.e., the meaning they attach to the situation \n(Brewer, 1994; Johnston & Carroll, 1998; Wiese-Bjornstal et al., 1998). According to \nLazarus (1999), emotions result from primary appraisal of goal congruence and secondary \nappraisal of what can be done. Perceived facilitation of personally relevant goals is expected \nto lead to positive emotions, thwarting to negative emotions. In the present study, negative \nemotions were particularly strong when Aidan inferred that the possibility of achieving the \nphysical self necessary for a desired identity was in jeopardy. Positive emotions generally \nfollowed from inferences of progress that would support his hope for or belief in the eventual \nattainment of his desired physical self. However, the study also suggests that lack of progress \ndoes not necessarily lead to negative emotions, as Aidan was not particularly bothered by the \nstagnation during his exam time. This may have been because he felt, having strong efficacy \nand fairly strong outcome beliefs, that he could speed up the healing at any time by re-\nengaging in his rehab regime. Furthermore, awareness was already declining during this \nperiod, and other aspects of his identity took precedence in his goal hierarchy, thereby \nbecoming more important in determining the appraisals that mediated his emotions (Lazarus, \n1999).   \nWhile mental imagery initially emerged as a separate theme, when integrating the \nresults in the \u201ctrack model\u201d, it seemed more fitting to locate the various images within \ndifferent tracks, as they appear to be associated with one or more distinguishable processes. \nFor example, replay images seem to belong in the awareness track, as they represent a form \nof non-deliberate awareness. An explanation for their occurrence may be the, subconscious, \nneed to integrate the trauma into previous psychological structures, achieved through re-\n   Exploring Mental Representation     24 \nexperiencing the traumatic event (Horowitz, 1976; Witvliet, 1997). Images associated with \nphysical sensations would seem to belong to the mental model track, as they serve to \nfacilitate understanding of medical information, and support explanations of physical \nsensations. They are also linked with emotions as their explanatory function will mediate \nappraisals of the meaning of the physical damage. It may be argued that more purposeful use \nof imagery, such as imaging copying the movement of the healthy arm during rehab exercises \nor engaging in healing imagery, is associated with the behaviour track, as it is something the \nathlete needs to actively undertake, rather than something that occurs spontaneously. \nAlthough they were not explored in this study, it is conceivable that the mental itinerary track \nmay give rise to visual and kinaesthetic images of, for example, goals, rehabilitation \nexercises, or various outcome scenarios. These could be spontaneously occurring or \npurposefully conjured up, and might provide targets for interventions. \nImages of healthy physical functioning seemed to be associated with the desired \nphysical self track, in particular images prompted by the frustration of not being able to \nexecute a particular activity. Aidan\u201fs story suggests that frustration gives rise to visual images \nof the self in action, which are drawn from memory and may be projected into the future. \nSport psychology\u201fs mental imagery literature might class these images as motivational (e.g., \nSordoni et al., 2000, 2002), however, to what extent they actually act as motivators to adhere \nto rehabilitation exercises is debatable. As these images seem to occur spontaneously, it may \nbe that their motivational effect would depend on the athlete\u201fs interpretation of the \nachievability of the image. Linking the use of imagery to outcome beliefs may be something \nto consider in future work. The fact that Aidan\u201fs images of healthy functioning tended to be \nexternal in perspective is interesting and begs the question whether the contradictory somatic \nexperience precludes an internal and kinaesthetic perspective, or whether an experienced \ndiscrepancy between current and desired self leads to a more distant, external perspective. In \n   Exploring Mental Representation     25 \nthis light, it is also worth investigating whether it would be possible to draw the desired self \ncloser by helping the athlete use imagery that involves a more internalised perspective. \nDespite Ievleva and Orlick\u201fs (1991) finding that healing imagery is more common in fast \nhealers, not much is known about which factors induce athletes to use this type of imagery or \nprevent them from using it. Aidan accepted early on that his recovery was going to be long \nand slow; he also argued that his injury was too complex and his knowledge of healing too \nlimited to create a visual picture. Whether there is a relationship between injury complexity, \nacceptance of slow recovery, and possibly motivation, is worth exploring in future studies on \nhealing imagery. \nIn conclusion, through examining the injury mental representation of one athlete, in-\ndepth and over time, this study enabled the identification and tentative integration of several \ndimensions of injury-relevant information processing and their longitudinal manifestations. \nBy pointing out the role of different types of awareness, the structure and importance of a \nmental itinerary, the increasing complexity of a mental model, and the motivational role of an \nathlete\u201fs desired physical self, the identified dimensions offer a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of injury-relevant information processing and emotional and behavioural \nreactions, as well as frameworks for future research. The proposed \u201cmulti-track\u201d model may \nbe a useful conceptualisation of athletes\u201f covert and overt activities during recovery. The \nstudy also highlighted the occurrence of spontaneous, in addition to more purposefully \nconjured up, mental images, and it is suggested that these images may be understood by \nplacing them within different \u201ctracks\u201d. \n  \n   Exploring Mental Representation     26 \nReferences \nBianco, T., Malo, S., & Orlick, T.
