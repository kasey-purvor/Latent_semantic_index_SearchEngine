The paper looks at an example of a \u201cpollution landscape\u201d through 6 \nthe lens of four distinct perspectives on the relationship between landscapes and society derived from 7 \nthe literature. The aim is both to develop a holistic understanding of the interaction of landscape and 8 \nsociety in the case study and to explore the insights and limitations of each perspective.  9 \nThe case-study explored in this paper is the case of coal ash pollution in the city of Tuzla in Bosnia and 10 \nHerzegovina. Environmental changes due to coal ash pollution in Tuzla have compromised the capacity 11 \nof the landscape to provide societal needs and generated new meanings associated with the landscape. 12 \nThe case-study shows that landscape influences local perceptions of environmental risks and as a 13 \nresult, local inhabitants develop risk management strategies dwelling in a pollution landscape. The 14 \npaper concludes that understanding the relationship between landscapes and societies may be 15 \nunderstood best as an interactive complex, examining the actions performed in and by landscapes.  16 \nKEYWORDS 17 \nCoal ash pollution, social constructionism, pollution landscape, Bosnia and Herzegovina 18 \nINTRODUCTION 19 \nThe city of Tuzla, the industrial centre of Northeast Bosnia, has 170,000 inhabitants dispersed along the 20 \nMajevica Mountain. Its name derives from the Turkish word Tuz, salt: Turkish records of industrial 21 \nexploitation of Tuzla salt can be traced back to the sixteenth century (Clancy and van Enkelen, 2005). 22 \nModernisation started during the Austro-Hungarian rule in the seventeenth century, when industrial 23 \nmethods for coal and salt mining were introduced. Later, during the years of the Former Yugoslavia, 24 \n 3 \nindustrialisation reached its peak, with the development of several chemical industries and above all, 1 \nthe Tuzla thermo-electric power plant (henceforth TEP). Today, Tuzla\u201fs industries find themselves 2 \nstruggling to compete in a global market, while environmental degradation is causing significant local, 3 \nnational and international concerns. TEP has been identified as one of the main point sources of 4 \npollution in the area of Tuzla (Brki\u0107 and Bar\u010di\u0107, undated). From every hill in the West of Tuzla, TEP 5 \ndominates both land and sky: the disposal of coal ash in the surrounding areas and the sulphur 6 \nemissions permeate the lives of the inhabitants of Tuzla. Even the climate of the valley seems to be 7 \nmodified by the steam water clouds emitted by the plant\u201fs coolers. 8 \nAsh is one of the main by-products from TEP. Ash and slag are transported hydraulically into settling 9 \nponds enclosed by a dyke. The water is either reused by circulation or returned to the river Jala. The 10 \ndisposal of waste is projected to continue for at least the next 25 years, and TEP has plans to enlarge 11 \nthe current disposal area. Local communities have confronted TEP with its environmental impacts 12 \n(Brki\u0107 and Bar\u010di\u0107, undated). One of the steps taken by TEP has been to join an EU funded consortium, 13 \nRECOAL, which is developing remediation solutions for the disposal sites.  14 \nThe European Landscape Convention\n1\n defines landscape as \u201can area, as perceived by people, whose 15 \ncharacter is the result of the action and interaction of natural and\/or human factors\u201d. Rather than 16 \nfocusing on either cultural or natural components of landscape, the Landscape Convention looks at how 17 \nthey interconnect. The Convention also suggests that people living a landscape should be given an 18 \nactive role in decision-making.  19 \nBut what occurs when landscapes undergo environmental pollution? The relationship between 20 \nlandscapes and societies must endure constant environmental modification, destruction and creation: 21 \nthe result is that alongside the facets that humans admire, landscapes also display \u201cthe threatening, the 22 \nawesome and the disgusting\u201d (Cosgrove, 1998; p xxix). Environmental pollution becomes, therefore, 23 \njust one of the characteristics of those landscapes.  24 \nHowever, in some cases, environmental pollution occurs in such a way that the consequences of change 25 \nbecome the dominant feature of the landscape. As explained above, industrial diffuse pollution is the 26 \npredominant characteristic of the landscape in Tuzla. The landscape contains new elements, some of 27 \nwhich may be prejudicial for human activities in that landscape. Pollution has transformed both the 28 \n 4 \nmaterial and symbolic features of this landscape, and in so doing a new relationship between 1 \nlandscapes and society has emerged.  2 \nThis paper is concerned with the material and symbolic dimensions of the pollution landscape of Tuzla. 3 \nFurthermore, landscapes need to be understood for what they \u201cdo\u201d, not only for what they \u201care\u201d 4 \n[material landscapes] or what they \u201cmean\u201d [symbolic landscapes] (Mitchell, 2002; p.1). Mitchell 5 \nsuggests that landscapes may even be agents of power that are (or represent themselves as) independent 6 \nfrom society (Mitchell, 2002; p.2). The paper offers a review of some different standpoints derived 7 \nfrom the literature that enable us to understand landscapes. The results are presented in four sections, 8 \nfollowing four distinct perspectives: landscape as provider of social functions; coal ash disposal and 9 \nlandscape meanings; landscape agency and the perception of the environmental risk; and dwelling in a 10 \npollution landscape.  11 \nFOUR THEORIES ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 12 \nLANDSCAPE AND SOCIETY 13 \nA common view on landscapes is to understand them as providers of social functions. For instance, 14 \nlandscapes take part in multiple processes for the preservation of ecosystems such as sediment and 15 \nnutrient trapping, pollutant degradation, or flood control (eg Leibowitz et al, 2000). Often, the 16 \nassumption underlying this view is that landscapes can be modified by humans in order to obtain 17 \nhuman commodities (Darvill, 1999;p.105; Relph, 1985 in Thomas, 1993;p.27). However, as Rackham 18 \n(1990) puts it, landscapes are not mere \u201cartefacts\u201d that can be modified according to human design; 19 \nrather they are living systems in constant evolution with a significant symbolic component (Rackham, 20 \n1990). 21 \nWhat are the meanings attached to landscapes? Some authors explain that place meanings range from 22 \nutilitarian values to sense of belonging, spirituality or aesthetics (Cheng, et al., 2003). But meanings are 23 \nnot inherent to a place. Meanings are conferred to landscapes by human experience and social action 24 \n(Tuan, 1977 in Stedman, 2003; Darvill, 1999;p.109;  Greider and Garkovich, 1994). Landscapes are 25 \nsocially  constructed with meanings attached by social actors  (Greider and Garkovich, 1994).  26 \n 5 \nLandscapes are both material and symbolic (Mercer, 2002). However, landscapes also have their own 1 \nagency. The natural components of landscapes do not always react to human action in a predictable 2 \nway. Sometimes they are stable enough to overcome \u201cfashions in land use\u201d (Rackham, 1990); in other 3 \ncases they may respond to human action in unexpected ways.  4 \nMoreover, the physical features of a place will also influence the meanings attached to a particular 5 \nsetting, contributing to a sense of place (Stedman, 2003). For instance, individual interactions with a 6 \nplace are influenced by its physical features, together with other social and cultural factors (Cheng, et 7 \nal., 2003). Space and observer are mutually constituted (Massey, 1994).  8 \nSome scholars have proposed to extend the concept of human agency to non-humans (Murdoch, 2001). 9 \nLandscapes have the capacity to produce physical and symbolic outcomes from a range of possible 10 \nalternatives. Thus, landscapes may also have their own agency. This does not imply a reification of 11 \nnature, but rather, it recognises the capacity of living systems to cause change and generate random 12 \nresponses. This view challenges more determinist perspectives on landscapes which may fail to 13 \nacknowledge the uncertainty that characterises landscape processes. 14 \nAnother way to understand the dual relationship between landscapes and societies is to consider 15 \nlandscapes as places of dwelling (Thomas, 1993; Ingold, 2000). This implies a lack of distance between 16 \npeople and things; in places of dwelling humans engage with the landscape through daily practices 17 \nrather than by detached visual contemplation (Thomas, 1993; Macnaghten and Urry, 1998; 201). Thus, 18 \nlandscapes originate in a compendium of human activities and interactions. They are activity spaces in 19 \nconstant evolution (Massey, 1994; 155). 20 \nMethodology 21 \nWhile studying the Tuzla case the different perspectives seemed to be useful to make sense of such a 22 \npollution landscape. In order to do so, we compiled the data gathered so far for the project RECOAL. 23 \nThis included e-mails, project reports and observations made during project meetings and 17 interviews 24 \nwith representatives of several local institutions. The results from the interviews were classified and 25 \ncoded using qualitative data software\n2\n. 26 \n 6 \nThe data was grouped into four categories, according to the four different understandings of the 1 \nrelationship between societies and landscapes observed in the literature, as described above. First, 2 \nlandscapes may be understood as providers of social functions. This view is commonly held in the 3 \nliterature of landscape planning. Second, landscapes can be understood as socially constructed places 4 \nof meaning, building on the tradition of social constructivism that has received considerable attention 5 \nwithin environmental sociology. Third, landscapes and societies may be engaged in a mutual two-fold 6 \nrelationship in which landscapes are capable of modifying human experiences of the environment. And 7 \nfinally, societies and landscapes may be understood as an interactive complex constituting the context 8 \nof human action, a place of dwelling. Figure 1 presents a representation of these views.   9 \nINSERT FIGURE 1 HERE 10 \nThe aim is to establish a framework against which different positions on the relationship between 11 \nlandscapes and societies can be compared. However, the framework may not be sufficient to assess 12 \nevery perspective in isolation. Instead, it is a useful analytical tool to explain how the different 13 \nperspectives interact and complement each other. 14 \nLandscape as provider of social functions 15 \nThe first perspective to be applied sees landscapes as providers of social functions.  Landscapes 16 \nprovide several functions such as maintenance of energy and material balances, supply and protection 17 \nof water resources, support for economic activities, the preservation of habitats and biodiversity, visual 18 \nenjoyment and recreation. 19 \nPollution compromises the maintenance of material and energy balances. For instance, in Tuzla, the 20 \ncoal ashes are deposed in wet lagoons. RECOAL scientists have identified two main issues of concern 21 \nrelated with coal ash disposal:  22 \n The dispersion of coal ash particles by the wind, polluting air, water and soil; and  23 \n The leaching of Potential Toxic Elements (PTEs) from the disposed ash.  24 \nPollution results in the introduction of extraneous substances potentially harmful for humans and 25 \necosystems. For instance, PTEs such as arsenic (As), boron (B), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and 26 \n 7 \nchromium (Cr) have been found in the layer of soil capping one of the disposal sites. Because these 1 \nelements occur naturally the issue is to determine whether or not the relative concentrations of these 2 \nelements is anomalously high relative to \u201cnormal\u201d background levels (Alloway and Ayres, 1993, 140). 3 \nHence, the existence of pollution will depend on what \u201cnormality\u201d is or how it is defined. A way to 4 \nestablish normality is by comparing the concentration values with those obtained in other locations 5 \nwith similar geographical characteristics. Another option is to examine what are the minimum 6 \nconcentrations that would endanger determined human activities. For instance RECOAL scientists 7 \nargue that in their samples the concentrations of PTEs mentioned above exceed the \u201ctolerable 8 \nthresholds for agricultural soils\u201d (BTUC, 2005). 9 \nCoal ash pollution also compromises the protection of water resources: changes in the chemical and 10 \nphysical properties of the water may constrain their use. The importance of these changes depends on 11 \nhow the water is going to be used. For instance, RECOAL scientists explain that the concentrations of 12 \nsome PTEs, such as arsenic or boron, in the water samples have been found to exceed the thresholds for 13 \n\u201cdrinking water standards\u201d (BTUC, 2005). In addition, concentrations are also compared with the 14 \nconcentrations of these elements in other rivers. For instance, most water samples taken in the disposal 15 \nsites have higher concentrations of arsenic or boron than those measured in the rivers Elbe and Rhein  16 \n(Ibid). Changes in the chemical composition of soil and water are therefore analysed through a 17 \ncomparative approach, which requires a definition of normality. Environmental problems are 18 \naggravated by the proximity of the disposal sites to human settlements (Figure 2).  19 \nINSERT FIGURE 2 HERE 20 \nThe Tuzla disposal sites have been recultivated after capping with a thin layer of soil (10-50 cm).  21 \nGiven that there are questions about its safety, it is surprising to find some local residents interested in 22 \nthe cultivation of those sites. An explanation arises by looking at the physical conditions of farming. 23 \nThe deposition of ashes in the valley has created flat areas in a mountainous geography that are 24 \nrelatively easy to cultivate. Moreover  the application of ashes to the soil may improve its structure and 25 \nits water holding capacity (Adriano and Weber, 2001), possibly increasing soil productivity in the short 26 \nterm immediately after application. It is possible that an initial rise in productivity may have influenced 27 \nthe intensity of agriculture on those sites. In this case the physical and chemical analyses offer two 28 \n 8 \ncomplementary descriptions of reality. Cultivation of the disposal sites is possible, and due to the 1 \nimprovements of its physical characteristics, the soils are likely to provide an increase in the yields; 2 \nhowever, the crops could take up some of the PTEs, possibly introducing them into the food chain.  3 \nFollowing the process of sedimentation, fine ash particles are disposed of in the top layers of the 4 \nlagoon. During drought periods the wind transports and deposits dust around the region. A scientist 5 \nwho had worked in the area explained in an informal interview:  6 \n\u201cThese ashes would be dispersed all around; imagine the markets, when you go to buy a piece 7 \nof fruit and you find that it has a dirty black layer of ashes\u2026\u201d 8 \nThe effects of the ashes go beyond the pollution of soil, air and water resources. The ashes influence all 9 \nhuman activity, from the visual enjoyment of the landscape to the development of economic or cultural 10 \nactivities. The effects of the ashes are visible from different locations. The disposal sites disrupt the 11 \nvalley structures. Once the lagoons are drained the ashes constitute a \u201cblack desert\u201d filling the space 12 \nbetween the hills. In some disposal sites a soil cover has been applied to reduce the evolution of dust; 13 \nthis has provided the conditions for re-vegetation and therefore the visual impacts are less dramatic. 14 \nPollution does not only refer to the introduction of potentially harmful chemical elements; pollution is 15 \nalso about the interaction of all the elements of landscapes at different scales: it occurs when the 16 \nlandscape is transformed in an unfamiliar place.    17 \nEnvironmental change due to the coal ash has interacted with a multitude of additional environmental 18 \nand social-economic factors, which make it very difficult to explain the problem in environmental 19 \nterms only. The coal ash pollution is one source of pollution among many others including those from a 20 \nnearby chemical plant and mining industries. The Bosnian war (1992-1995) also induced notable 21 \nenvironmental change. Some impacts of the war on the Bosnian landscapes include the degradation of 22 \nforest due to fuel needs in nearby cities, and outbreaks of bark beetle colonisation due to artillery and 23 \nbomb damage (see Dudley, et al., 2002).  24 \nUnderstanding the landscape as the provider of human needs may enable us to point out routes of 25 \naction to reduce or control the pollution: for instance by reducing the concentrations of PTEs from that 26 \nlandscape. However, this approach presents some problems.  What pollution is can be defined 27 \n 9 \ndifferently depending on the functions that the landscape may serve. For instance, higher 1 \nconcentrations PTEs may be less significant if we are going to use the water for irrigation than if we 2 \nuse it for drinking.  3 \nStudying pollution as a chemical phenomenon in the landscape requires a reduction of scale that may 4 \nnot be appropriate for the study of landscapes; yet it provides solutions to some of the practical 5 \nproblems arising. Even though reductionism is commonly associated with oversimplification 6 \n(Gallagher and Appenzeller, 1999) it may be unavoidable whilst studying landscapes as providers of 7 \nhuman needs. In a landscape, the complexity of natural phenomena adds to the inherent complexity of 8 \nthe social interactions which define it. Understanding the individual elements of a landscape will only 9 \ngive us a partial view of landscapes without reflecting the interactions between its elements. The next 10 \nsection examines how landscape meanings can also inform the study of pollution landscapes.  11 \nCoal ash disposal and landscape meanings 12 \nThe second perspective applied in this study understands landscapes as constructed places of meaning; 13 \nmeaning is attached to landscapes through social action. The disruption of those meanings by pollution 14 \nmay cause (or resolve) social conflicts.  Contradictions seem to arise not only between the different 15 \nsocial actors, but also within the narratives of individuals; this is the result of the dynamic nature of 16 \nlandscape meanings which are renegotiated in every process of human interaction.  17 \nAs the energy provider TEP comes into the houses of local people: it provides the heating for the city 18 \nof Tuzla while it also pollutes the air. However, TEP\u201fs owner, Elektropiveda, is managed at the State 19 \nlevel by the Federal Government. TEP provides local employment but its major economic benefits are 20 \nfrom exporting electricity; a municipality worker says: \u201cTuzla gets the pollution and Sarajevo gets the 21 \nbenefits.\u201d This phrasing suggests that TEP is perceived as a symbol of an inaccessible central 22 \ngovernment. The enormous complex of buildings of TEP and its network of infrastructures (pipelines, 23 \ndisposal sites, water vapour clouds and so forth) seems to evoke the inaccessibility and obscurity that 24 \nthe citizens associate with bureaucratic structures. Furthermore, the former regime seems to resonate in 25 \nthe industrial landscape. A local NGO worker suggested that the TEP symbolised the \u201cthe strategy of 26 \nformer Yugoslavia\u201d, that is, \u201cdevelopment regardless of the consequences\u201d. 27 \n 10 \nINSERT FIGURE 3 HERE 1 \nBut this view of TEP as a symbol of dominance is only a partial view. Closer inspection reveals 2 \ndifferent encounters with this particular pollution landscape. TEP is simultaneously a provider of 3 \nwealth and a poisonous threat. Its overwhelming presence in the Tuzla suburbs causes ambivalent 4 \nfeelings, as has been observed in other cases of chronic pollution (eg Wynne, 1996). Alongside the 5 \nindustrial constructions, the landscape presents elements belonging to the people living on it: wherever 6 \nthe soil in the disposal sites allows cultivation, farming practices are taking place; not only food crops, 7 \nbut also trees and hedges show man\u201fs willingness to make a better landscape around the villages; where 8 \nthe disposal sites lack soil, people develop other activities such as keeping sheep among the willows or 9 \nwalking the dog; houses, isolated or in groups, arise in the hills, some of them extremely close to the 10 \ndisposal sites; the paths are well maintained, and trees are planted close to the pipelines. The pollution 11 \nlandscape has not been abandoned but appropriated. 12 \nThe literature on symbolic meanings of landscapes commonly argues that how landscapes are socially 13 \nconstructed determines how they are used to reinforce dominant discourses of power and knowledge. 14 \nHarner (2001) understands landscapes as reflections of the current hegemonic (or dominant) discourse 15 \nin an area. Following this premise, he concludes that when the hegemonic discourse is absent, identity 16 \ncan not be materialised in landscapes, and, as a consequence, landscapes become contested (Harner, 17 \n2001). 18 \nIn contrast, landscapes can be understood as social constructions that become negotiated in everyday 19 \nlife, rather than being spaces for confrontation. Although domination and contestation may occur as 20 \npart of the negotiation process the outcome is the result of multiple struggles for power. For instance, 21 \nPetrzelka (2004) describes the example of the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the landform \u201cLoess Hills\u201d in western 22 \nIowa. The landform was first described by the scientific community, only to be adopted by the local 23 \nresidents as a new identity feature. The uniqueness of the new landform helped the local community to 24 \nface new socio-economic challenges swapping from agriculture into landform tourism (Petrzelka, 25 \n2004). As in the Petrzelka story, local people in Tuzla have appropriated some of the elements of the 26 \nlandscape.  The socially constructed landscape is negotiated through subtle everyday practices, from 27 \ncultivating the disposal sites to awakening memories whilst contemplating the landscape. 28 \n 11 \nSocial meanings attached to a landscape may acquire negative connotations after a pollution event. For 1 \ninstance, talking about a contaminated community in Legler, New Jersey, Edelstein (2004) shows the 2 \ndesperation that may pervade an area coping with a disaster. Legler inhabitants found new things in 3 \ntheir environment that made their landscape odd and unfamiliar. For instance they observed their fruits 4 \ngrowing disproportionately or experienced strange smells coming out of the water (Edelstein, 2004; ch 5 \n3). Similar fears arise in the communities in Tuzla, whose locals may have seen how pollution pervades 6 \nthe elements of their common life. A local representative in one of these communities explains: \u201cOur 7 \nfruit trees are destroyed. For example, our cherries are completely destroyed. There are no cherries\u201d.  8 \nEdelstein observed that the Legler community adopted a vision of a malevolent environment 9 \nresponding to unbalanced human actions. This implied not only a shift of meanings attached to the 10 \nlandscape but also a redefinition of the people\u201fs identities and their views for the future (Edelstein, 11 \n2004;p.89). A local representative of communities close to the Tuzla disposal sites explained: \u201cthere 12 \nare people who grow the wheat there. This is what kills people over here\u201d. Is the pollution landscape a 13 \nkiller, rather than a provider of subsistence food? The environment is represented as a negative force 14 \nthat influences their lives. Talking about TEP\u201fs contribution to environmental degradation a local NGO 15 \nworker comments \u201c\u2026the power plant is even friendly\u2026 like we have even seen flowers around it; they 16 \nwant it to look nice\u201d. By saying this, the worker is implying that TEP wants to look nice [they even 17 \ncare about the visual appearance of their landscape] but they are not nice [behind the efforts on the 18 \nvisual appearance lies the spectre of pollution]. In her view \u201clocal communities from this power plant 19 \ndo not get anything but polluted air\u2026\u201d Local actors may feel threatened if, while the benefits of TEP 20 \nare shared at the national level, the impacts of pollution are experienced locally. Moreover, local people 21 \nimply that \u201csuffering the pollution\u201d establishes the grounds to demand compensation benefits. 22 \nCompensation is a potential way of bridging the gap between national and local scales.  23 \nDifferent cultural backgrounds and understandings [and possibly interests] can produce different views 24 \non a particular landscape. Memories, grounded in local perceptions, are cultural representations 25 \nthrough which landscapes are socially constructed  (Lahiri and Singh, 1999). The pollution event is 26 \nmagnified by contrasting it with the landscapes that remain in the memories of local villagers. 27 \nResidents recall their past landscapes with nostalgia, regretting how the relationship they had with their 28 \nlandscape has deteriorated. A local member said: \u201cwe had a picnic ground in Bukinje [one of the towns 29 \n 12 \nclose to the disposal sites] in 1960, and people used to celebrate the Labour Day, over here\u201d: the 1 \npollution landscape is not a place for celebration anymore. 2 \nThis section summarised some of the possible meanings that can be attached to a pollution landscape. 3 \nHow meanings are attached depends on individual experiences and on how those meanings are 4 \ncommunicated. Meanings become negotiated in every process of human interaction. The assessment of 5 \nthe importance of landscapes for human societies is incomplete without understanding its symbolic 6 \ndimension. In addition, the study of these meanings may be helpful to identify possible routes of 7 \nconsensus about the significance of environmental change in that landscape. The symbolic dimension 8 \nof landscape may explain what is acceptable for the society that lives in that landscape, and therefore 9 \nmay contribute to redefine adequate strategies of landscape management. However, understanding 10 \nlandscapes as places of meaning does not reflect that landscapes, as living systems, are unpredictable 11 \nand they also influence human experience. The next section examines how this influence may occur. 12 \nLandscape agency and the perception of environmental risk 13 \nThe third perspective considers that the relationship between landscapes and societies is two-fold, and 14 \nlandscapes are credited with their own agency. Because landscapes have their own agency in 15 \nresponding to environmental change, society faces unexpected responses from their landscapes. While 16 \nscientists may contend the details of local interpretations, people surrounded by the pollution may 17 \ndevelop an understanding of the pollution that will modify their actions within the given landscape.  18 \nThere are many examples of how physical changes caused by environmental pollution have modified 19 \nlocal experiences of the landscape. Local villagers talk about the pollution effects on animals and plants 20 \nwith vivid descriptions of the impacts of the pollution on their surroundings. Following the creation of 21 \nthe disposal sites local communities have lost common forest areas and see game and fishing 22 \ndisappearing. Water pollution has resulted in the closure of several wells. Dust encroaches upon the 23 \ncultivation of their home gardens. 24 \nINSERT FIGURE 4 HERE 25 \n 13 \nThe soil cover on the sites was established to stop the dust evolution that caused public concerns at the 1 \nend of the 1980s. However, once the ashes were covered with soil, farming started on the sites without 2 \nany institutional control. Local people explain that the scarcity of food suffered during the war (1992-3 \n1995) fostered the cultivation of the sites. After the war, cultivation continued, but opposition to 4 \ncultivation surfaced within the local communities. A local representative in Bukinje explained that the 5 \ncultivation of the sites for food and fodder was related to ill health within the local communities: 6 \n\u201c\u2026there are people who grow the wheat there [on the sites], clover, and other crops. This [pollution 7 \nthrough the food chain] is what kills people over here....\u201d  8 \nThe example above shows that the capacity of landscapes to modify human experiences is not limited 9 \nto influencing physical observations on the environment, but rather, landscapes may also influence how 10 \nindividuals and groups construct new symbolic meanings of landscapes and society. Moreover, 11 \nlandscape features can interrelate with social conflicts and intervene in power relations. For instance, 12 \nwhile talking about the lack of trust in TEP and municipal experts, a local inhabitant said that:  13 \n\u201c\u2026they keep on tricking us, that [the] situation is not alarming. There was \"a yellow snow\" 14 \non Thursday and again it is not alarming.\u201d 15 \nIn this quote, the interviewee demonstrates his lack of trust on the authorities in charge of 16 \nenvironmental pollution. He says \u201e\u2019they keep tricking us\u2019 because he perceives official assurances on 17 \nthe state of the environment as deception attempts. In order to support his argument, the landscape is 18 \ncalled as the witness of the pollution problem that people are suffering. Landscapes can not be reified 19 \nto speak in words. Rather, landscapes \u201cspeak\u201d with facts and signs. In this case the fact is the \u201cyellow 20 \nsnow\u201d. A common event, the snow, is transformed into something abnormal and unexpected when 21 \nchanging its colour. The atypical phenomenon casts a doubt on the opinions of \u201eexperts\u201f and justifies a 22 \nchange of attitude towards them within the local communities.  23 \nThe assemblage of everyday observations on the environment may lead to the development of new 24 \nsources of expertise. For instance, local inhabitants living close to the Tuzla coal ash disposal sites said 25 \nthat they are aware of the health risks that surround them. They highlight that there is a 26 \ndisproportionate incidence of cancer and that few local people reach 60 years. Apart from the day to 27 \nday observation of the local dynamics, local people have their own \u201cexperts\u201d: they support their own 28 \n 14 \nopinions by referring to communications made to them by friends \u201cwith a PhD\u201d or their local doctor. 1 \nExpertise is not a monopoly of outsiders. Local people develop their own expertise. The signs provided 2 \nby the landscape may constitute one of the sources of this expertise. Both \u201cexperts\u201d and \u201clay\u201d people 3 \ndevelop different understandings depending on the social context in which they develop their actions. 4 \nHowever, in order to develop those meanings they refer to phenomena observed within the landscape, 5 \nsuch as changes in the ecosystems or in land uses. Because of the uncertainty attached to the whole 6 \nprocess of environmental change, landscape responses are perceived as environmental risks. Thus, 7 \nlandscape agency may influence human perception of environmental risks.  8 \nThe perception of the pollution risk is directly related to the experiences in the communities 9 \nsurrounding the coal ash disposal sites in Tuzla and it influences the meanings that people attach to a 10 \nplace. In Tuzla, the perception of those risks is affected by the observation of atypical phenomena on 11 \nthe landscape such as the \u201cyellow snow\u201d. By influencing the perceptions of risk, landscapes affect the 12 \nvery social construction of those landscapes. For instance, in Tuzla, atypical phenomena transform an 13 \napparently familiar landscape into a \u201cpollution landscape\u201d, potentially threatening the lives of those 14 \nliving in such a landscape. Thus, landscapes may modify the processes that humans use to attach 15 \nmeanings to landscapes.  16 \nThis perspective shows that landscapes may influence human experience and, therefore, determine the 17 \nways in which meanings are attached to nature, reformulating, for instance, the social construction of 18 \nlandscapes. Understanding how these processes occur may reveal the different perceptions of the actors 19 \nliving in such a landscape. This process is, however, non static. The mutual influence of society and 20 \nlandscape seems to merge both together in an interactive complex. The next section attempts to 21 \nunderstand this \u201cinteractive complex\u201d as the result of the multiple actions that the different actors 22 \ndevelop on the landscape where they dwell.  23 \nDwelling in a pollution landscape 24 \nThe fourth perspective understands landscapes and societies as elements impossible to tell apart in the 25 \ncontext where humans develop their actions. In the past section, we have seen that landscapes have 26 \nagency not only to physically influence the environmental changes in which they are involved, but also 27 \n 15 \nto modify the ways in which society understands them. The perception of risks influences the activities 1 \nof people dwelling in pollution landscapes. People develop strategies to cope with those risks. 2 \nOne of the first steps in the development of these strategies is the formulation of an understanding of 3 \nthe risk problem within the local context. For instance, local people around Tuzla named \u201cradiation\u201d as 4 \nthe major problem associated with the coal ashes, contradicting current technical and expert 5 \nassessments of the sites which draw attention to the high concentrations of PTEs. In accordance with 6 \nrisk literature, referring to radioactivity highlights the lack of control local people feel that they have 7 \nover these risks (Davis, 2005).  Because radiation is not perceived to be localisable or reducible to 8 \nindividual parts, the concept of radiation may resonate with the local understandings of pollution within 9 \nthe landscape as a whole. In any case, local concerns about radiation demand the investigation of this 10 \nissue as a priority, in order to address the concerns of those who live in the pollution landscape.  11 \nPollution is embedded in all aspects of everyday life. There are not one but several sources of pollution. 12 \nTogether with the thermo-electric plant there are, in the area, a chemical industry, solid waste disposal 13 \nsites, 4 petrol stations, a concrete factory, a construction material warehouse and communal 14 \ninfrastructure in bad condition (sewerage, roads, water supply, waste disposal). The difficulties in 15 \nestablishing causal links between the industry and their risks opens the door for a range of individual 16 \nexplanations, tainted with scepticism (Beck, 1992; 31). The consequence is what Beck calls \u201corganised 17 \nirresponsibility\u201d: a range of human-created risks for which no one is accountable (Giddens, 1999).  18 \nPeople dwelling in a pollution landscape may have a holistic view of it, in which all the environmental 19 \nand social elements seem to be interconnected. Under a holistic view of the landscape, one possible 20 \nstrategy to cope with pollution may be to continue \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, as if the risk were non existent. 21 \nThere are several examples in the literature in which risks caused by chronic pollution may become 22 \nintegral accepted parts of everyday routine. For instance, people may just \u201cget used to it\u201d (Sapountzaki 23 \nand Chalkias, 2005). Local people may find it difficult to separate the pollution issues from other 24 \nmaterial concerns embedded in the surroundings (Burningham and Thrush, 2004). 25 \nThe literature shows that local residents living in an area affected by pollution tend to be reluctant to 26 \nrecognise pollution in their own neighbourhood (Phillimore and Moffatt, 2004). In some cases 27 \nidentifying the pollution caused by a local industry as a serious risk may pose more threats than it 28 \n 16 \nresolves (Burningham and Thrush, 2004). For instance, an interviewee that owns a farm in one of the 1 \nsites explained that agriculture on the ashes did not pose any environmental risk. Instead he was 2 \nconvinced that only \u201clazy people\u201d did not want to cultivate the sites. In contrast, those who oppose 3 \ncultivation argue that the consumption of crops from the disposal sites endangers the whole 4 \ncommunity, and it is \u201cwhat kills people over here [the local community]\u201d, as one local resident from 5 \nBukinje explained. 6 \nWhen collective action and mitigation strategies are limited other individual strategies may arise. For 7 \ninstance, a local representative in Tuzla explained that emigration of young generations in search of 8 \n\u201cbetter\u201d places to live is a common trend in the area. Among the locals a frequent refrain is that the 9 \nyoung ones are gone; they went away to the cities [or even to foreign countries] in search of a better 10 \nlife. Individual coping strategies may result in the fragmentation of the polluted community and the 11 \nstigmatisation of those who are more affected by the pollution (McGee, 1999).  12 \nTo summarise the fourth perspective, people and landscape interact. While dwelling in landscapes, 13 \npeople develop risk management strategies to cope with pollution. These strategies are likely to have 14 \ninfluences back upon the pollution landscape. The natural elements of landscape, its meanings and its 15 \nautonomy all seem to be embedded in the actions through which local people live their everyday lives.  16 \nDISCUSSION 17 \nUnderstanding landscapes as artefacts to fulfil human needs may be a useful view when landscapes 18 \nneed to be managed under scarcity of resources. Establishing needs enables us to establish clear 19 \nobjectives and priorities, which can be translated, into policy and management actions. However 20 \nattending exclusively to environmental and physical variables denies the existence of a landscape 21 \nstrongly influenced by sociological variables.  22 \nThe case study in Tuzla shows the importance of landscape meanings, which are continually negotiated 23 \nthrough social processes. Attempts by powerful actors to appropriate landscapes may result in conflicts 24 \nwith those engaging with the land in different ways (Bender, 1993; 246). Landscape modifications may 25 \nchallenge people\u201fs interactions with their environment and their self-definition (Greider and Garkovich, 26 \n 17 \n1994). Therefore the symbolic dimensions of landscape set limits to its management: they help to 1 \ndefine what is acceptable within a society.  2 \nBecause landscapes are constructed through human experience it is important to include the people 3 \nliving on it and the variety of their human experience in landscape management. This strategy may help 4 \nto avoid possible conflicts arising from the confrontation of different perspectives and meanings of 5 \nlandscape. Other additional benefits may be creating trust between different stakeholders or 6 \ncontributing to a sense of collective identity and ownership of the landscape.  7 \nSome landscape ecologists have acknowledged the importance of incorporating considerations of the 8 \nrelationship between society and landscapes into landscape planning. Landscape management needs to 9 \nincorporate humans because they are \u201cintegral components of the ecosystem\u201d (Botequilha and Ahern, 10 \n2002; 67). Human societies are also important drivers of change in landscapes (Field et al., 2003). 11 \nOther authors recognise the importance of incorporating a \u201cproper participation process\u201d in order to 12 \nincorporate different accounts of the landscape in the management process (Kangas et al., 2005; 612).  13 \nLandscape management should also consider that landscapes have their own agency influencing both 14 \nmaterial and symbolic dimensions of landscapes. The way in which landscapes react to human induced 15 \nchange is highly unpredictable. The perception of the risk created by an environmental change is a 16 \nmanifestation of the landscape agency over the meanings that humans attach to landscapes. 17 \nRisk dynamics mirror the relationship between society and landscapes in the face of an environmental 18 \nchange such as pollution. When landscapes are regarded as material entities, risk is the possibility of 19 \ncompromising the capacity of the landscape to fulfil societal needs. When landscapes are understood as 20 \nsymbolic constructions, risk is the construction that can turn a landscape from a benign entity to a 21 \nhazardous one. The meaning and experience of landscapes changes depending on how the risk of 22 \npollution is interpreted. But risk perceptions \u201chave a reality of their own\u201d (Renn, 2004).  Its very 23 \nconstruction makes the risk closer and more \u201ereal\u201f.  24 \nA pollution landscape may be explained in several ways, from analysing the pollutants to 25 \nunderstanding how people perceive the pollution and its causes. Some of these perspectives are 26 \nfrequently combined in additive fashion. However, in the example of Tuzla a more complete picture of 27 \n 18 \nthe landscape emerges from understanding people\u201fs actions on that landscape, beyond its natural and 1 \nsymbolic components.  2 \nCONCLUSION 3 \nThe example of coal ash pollution in Tuzla has allowed the exploration of the relationship between 4 \nsocieties and landscapes in the case of a pollution landscape. A pollution landscape is not only one 5 \nwhere some of its elements are polluted. A pollution landscape requires also the social construction of 6 \nthe landscape as a malevolent environment which conditions the lives of those dwelling on it. In a 7 \npollution landscape, atypical and unfamiliar phenomena are perceived as symptoms of the hazardous 8 \nnature of that landscape.  9 \nThe four perspectives applied in this paper give us useful insights about our understanding of the 10 \nlandscape, but each of them presents some limitations. Understanding landscapes as providers of 11 \nhuman needs fails to explain some of the main characteristics of the pollution landscape, such as its 12 \nsymbolic nature, but it may provide concrete action points to guarantee that those needs are fulfilled. 13 \nStudying the meanings that humans attach to landscapes fails to acknowledge the influence of natural 14 \nprocesses on human life, but it identifies the social limitations to landscape management and the 15 \npossible points of conflict between the different actors. Studying the agency of pollution landscapes 16 \ngive us a sophisticated view of how pollution landscape may influence human action, and highlights 17 \nthe importance of the unexpected in pollution landscapes. Finally, understanding landscapes as places 18 \nof dwelling helps to understand the actions that humans develop while living in landscapes. Although 19 \nthis perspective reflects better the dynamic nature of landscapes and its interaction with societies, it 20 \ndoes not provide clear answers as to how to preserve landscape functions, how to prevent conflicts 21 \nbetween different actors or how to cope with unexpected responses given by pollution landscapes.  22 \nEach perspective gives responses to different questions. Hence, the perspectives are complementary 23 \nrather than opposite. However, from the paper arises the idea that the last perspective, understanding 24 \nlandscapes as dwelling places, may have a more holistic and dynamic character. This view argues that a 25 \nlandscape is an interactive complex of natural and symbolic components that are mutually influenced 26 \nby both society and landscapes. Both society and landscapes shape each other, reformulating meanings, 27 \n 19 \nchanging physical realities and modifying the factors that influence society perceptions. This endless 1 \ncircle of mutual transformation merges societies and landscapes in a network of actions, dissolving 2 \ntheir frontiers into a \u201chybrid\u201d system.  3 \nRather than analysing the independent components of landscapes, this perspective suggests that 4 \nlandscapes can better be represented by studying the actions developed on and by them. For instance, in 5 \nthe case of the pollution landscape in Tuzla, a picture of the landscape emerges by understanding how 6 \nlocal inhabitants develop risk management strategies to cope with environmental threats. The landscape 7 \nof Tuzla is therefore better understood by studying the actions of all the actors on that landscape and 8 \nthose performed by the landscape itself.  9 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 10 \nThis paper was supported by EPSRC, the Centre for Environmental Strategy (University of Surrey) and 11 \nForest Research.
