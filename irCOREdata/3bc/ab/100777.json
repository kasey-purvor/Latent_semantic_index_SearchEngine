Melting\nand solidifying occur on a nanosecond time scale, often\nwithout affecting the underlying substrate. The properties of\ncrystallized silicon depend on a number of factors, with laser\npulse shape being one of the most significant. The surface of\nthe laser crystallized silicon film can be extremely rough,6\nand by changing the beam shape, the film can be nanostruc-\ntured simultaneously during crystallization to create a large\narea textured nanocrystalline silicon \u0001nc-Si:H\u0002 for use in nc-\nSi:H \/polymer heterojunction photovoltaic devices. We re-\nport laser crystallized and textured nc-Si:H\/poly\u00012-methoxy-\n5-\u00012\u0001-ethyl-hexyloxy\u0002-1,4-phenylenevinylene, \u0001MEH-PPV\u0002\nbilayer solar cell, which shows significantly higher efficiency\ncompared to previously reported a-Si:H\/MEH-PPV solar\ncells.\nChemical vapor deposited heavily doped p-type hydro-\ngenated amorphous silicon carbide \u0001\u000512 nm\u0002\/undoped\na-Si:H \u0001400 nm\u0002 structures deposited on 500 nm thick in-\ndium tin oxide \u0001ITO\u0002 coated glass substrates were obtained\nfrom a commercial producer. A KrF Lambda Physik excimer\nlaser \u0001LPX 210i\u0002, operating at 248 nm with a 25 ns full\nwidth at half maximum pulse duration, was used for laser\nnanostructuring.6 The a-Si:H films on glass were nanostruc-\ntured in air by scanning along an asymmetric peak 4\n\u00018 mm2 laser pulse. The scanning was performed along the\nlong axis, keeping the steeper edge of the asymmetric pulse\nas the leading edge. The scanning speed for the experiment\nwas 2 mm s\u22121 with pulse repetition rate maintained at 50 Hz.\nAn energy density of 160 mJ cm\u22122\/pulse was used for nano-\nstructuring. The laser energy was measured using a Molec-\ntron EPM 1000 analyzer and a J25LP-MUV pyroelectric de-\ntector.\nThe laser nanostructured device subassembly was then\ndipped into a buffered hydrofluoric acid for 20 s to remove\nthe oxide layer. A 10 mg cm\u22123 MEH-PPV in chloroform was\nspun cast onto the subassembly at 1500 rpm for 60 s imme-\ndiately after the acid treatment, before evaporating a 50 nm\nthick Al back electrode. A similarly textured, acid treated\nsample was investigated along with a polymer spun sample,\nusing atomic force microscopy \u0001AFM\u0002 for surface character-\nization.

Photovoltaic current-voltage charac-\nteristics were measured using an Oriel 81160 Class B \u0001Ref.\n10\u0002 solar simulator with a nonuniformity of irradiance at\n\u00035%.11 A Keithley 2400 source meter was used for the\ncurrent-voltage measurements. The photovoltaic current-\nvoltage characteristics were measured again after an hour,\nbefore probing the Al surface using AFM. Figure 1\u0001c\u0002 shows\nthe three dimensional representation of the Al surface, which\nresulted in a rms roughness of 21 nm.\nFrom AFM, the maximum peak-to-peak height of the\nsurface protrusions of the laser nanostructured surface was\ncalculated to be greater than a micron, reduced to just below\na micron for the polymer spun surface. It is further reduced\nto \u0005100 nm for the Al surface. Since the thickness of the\ninitial a-Si:H film is 400 nm, these heights suggest that the\ntexturing process exposes the underlying ITO layer at ran-\ndom locations. It is assumed that the bulk of the area is\ncovered with at least a very thin layer of nc-Si:H. A sche-\nmatic diagram of the bilayer solar cell based on these obser-\nvations is shown in Fig. 1\u0001d\u0002. The thickness of the polymer\nlayer of the device is nonuniform, as seen in Fig. 1\u0001d\u0002, while\nthe effective captive area of the solar irradiation is increased.\nThe nc-Si:H layer is expected to be similar to that of a par-\ntially melted film with a stratified structure.7\nFigure 2 shows the current density\u2013voltage characteris-\ntics of the solar cell measured in the dark \u0001black squares\u0002 and\nunder simulated solar irradiation \u0001hollow squares\u0002, immedi-\nately after fabrication. The cell has an open circuit voltage\n\u0001Voc\u0002 of 0.56 V and a short circuit current density \u0001Jsc\u0002 of\n6.65 mA cm\u22122. The fill factor of the device \u00010.23\u0002 is low,\nowing to the high series and low shunt resistances, which is\nevident from the gradients at forward bias and at Jsc, respec-\ntively. The resultant power conversion efficiency of the de-\nvice is 0.87%, which is two orders of magnitude greater than\nthe best a-Si:H\/MEH-PPV cell reported to date.4 The MEH-\nPPV layer of the device shows an electron acceptorlike be-\nhavior in this case, which is contrary to previous\nobservations.4\nIn order to check the stability of the device, the device\ncurrent-voltage characteristics were measured under simu-\nlated irradiation, after an hour\u2019s exposure in the dark to at-\nmospheric conditions. The performance degraded drastically,\nas shown in Fig. 2 \u0001circles\u0002, with Voc and Jsc reduced to\n0.19 V and 2.77 mA cm\u22122, respectively, resulting in a power\nconversion efficiency of 0.13%. MEH-PPV based organic\nsolar cells are highly susceptible to atmospheric exposure,\ndegrading the photocurrent density with commensurate de-\ncrease in efficiency.12 It has been reported that the current\ndensity of MEH-PPV homopolymer devices is reduced by\n80% during the first hour of atmospheric exposure.12 With\nthe devices analyzed here, Jsc is reduced by 60% after an\nhour\u2019s exposure to atmosphere, comparing better and sug-\ngesting that the polymer layer is active during the initial\noperation of the device.\nA laser crystallized nc-Si:H reference device without the\nMEH-PPV layer is impossible to be fabricated using exactly\nthe same crystallization\/nanostructuring conditions due to\npinhole creation. However, a laser crystallized nc-Si:H cell\nwas fabricated at the same laser energy density for compari-\nson, avoiding pinholes by keeping the surface roughness to a\nminimum. This condition was achieved using the same\na-Si:H based subassembly, annealed in vacuum \u00010.03 Pa\u0002,\nscanning with the asymmetric pulse utilizing the gradual end\nas the leading edge. All other parameters were maintained\nidentical to the bilayer device fabrication process. The nc-\nSi:H monolayer cell contains more silicon compared to the\nlaser textured nc-Si:H film, due to less ablation during crys-\ntallization, resulting in a continuous film with a rms rough-\nness of 45 nm. The cell completed with Al back contact\nyielded a power conversion efficiency of 0.20%, with Voc\n0.10 V and Jsc 7.20 mA cm\u22122. The current density\u2013voltage\ncharacteristics of the nc-Si:H monolayer cell under simulated\nirradiation are shown in Fig. 2 \u0001triangles\u0002.\nThe shunt resistance \u0001Rsh\u0002 of the nc-Si:H monolayer cell\nwas low \u0001298 \u0004\u0002, believed to be due to grain boundaries\nincreasing the leakage at thin areas of the active layer from\nlaser annealing. However, the Rsh of the nc-Si:H\/MEH-PPV\ncell shows a threefold increase with the inclusion of the\nMEH-PPV layer at 970 \u0004. The bilayer device Rsh also shows\nreasonable stability for atmospheric exposure, showing\n870 \u0004 after degradation. The Rsh improvement from the in-\nclusion of the MEH-PPV layer is identified to be one of the\nreasons for the higher efficiency of bilayer device.\nThe photon conversion efficiencies of the hybrid cell and\nnc-Si:H monolayer cell were measured just after the initial\nphotovoltaic characterization. A Bentham IL1 100 W halo-\ngen light source and a TMc 300 monochromator were used\nalong with a Keithley 487 picoammeter for measurements.\nThe incident optical power onto the sample was measured\nwith a calibrated Newport 1830C optical power meter. Fig-\nure 3 shows the photon conversion efficiencies of the bilayer\ndevice \u0001squares\u0002 and nc-Si:H cell \u0001hollow circles\u0002 along with\nthe normalized optical absorption of MEH-PPV \u0001black\ncircles\u0002. The nc-Si:H cell shows lower photon conversion\nefficiencies, mainly believed to be due to thermal damage to\nthe p-type\/intrinsic silicon interface.13 From Fig. 3, it is clear\nthat the photoexcited carrier collection is improved drasti-\ncally by the inclusion of MEH-PPV layer. This observation\nsuggests that the MEH-PPV layer not only improves the Rsh\nof the device, but also enhances carrier collection compared\nto the nc-Si:H monolayer cell.\nFIG. 2.

The vacuum level of the polymer\nand Al layer were assumed to be the same for the diagram\nwhich is shown in Fig. 4. The barrier introduced at the nc-\nSi:H\/MEH-PPV interface would be expected to retard elec-\ntron extraction promoting recombination and degrading cell\nperformance. Hence, for the observed device operation, ei-\nther the barrier should be lowered or electrons should be able\nto tunnel through to the Al contact. Therefore, it is plausible\nthat a vacuum level shift occurs at the MEH-PPV\/Al\ninterface,14,15 leading to the possibility of a critical thickness\nof MEH-PPV, where electrons can tunnel through to the Al\ncontact. The dotted line section in Fig. 4 illustrates this pos-\nsibility. Further, it has been reported that hole conducting\norganic layers and low work function metals show Schottky-\nbarrier-like behavior,16 which would enhance the charge\ntransport process proposed for the nc-Si:H\/MEH-PPV bi-\nlayer device.\nIn conclusion, 0.87% efficient nc-Si:H\/MEH-PPV het-\nerojunction solar cells were fabricated by simultaneous exci-\nmer laser crystallization and by texturing an intrinsic a-Si:H\nfilm. The polymer shows an electron-acceptor-like behavior\nin organic photovoltaic terminology, instead of a donor,\nwhich has been the conventional role of MEH-PPV. The\npolymer layer increases the light harvesting capability of the\ncell, and increases the shunt resistance while increasing open\ncircuit voltage. The origin of the photovoltage remains in-\nconclusive and is speculated to be governed by the polymer\nat a critical thickness in the structure.\nThe authors thank Nilushan Mudugamuwa for the help\nprovided during device fabrication.
