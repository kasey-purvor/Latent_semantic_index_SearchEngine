All rights reserved.1. Introduction\nThe rapid improvement of sequencing techniques in the last\ndecade and the availability of suitable markers has provided\nimportant insights into the evolution of taxa in space and time\nand greatly advanced the field of phylogeography. Following the\nmany studies on the northern hemisphere we have now a good\nunderstanding of how species separated, expanded and shifted\nbreeding ranges and how these processes were influenced by past\nglaciation (Avise and Walker, 1998; Hewitt, 2001; Hewitt, 2004a;\nHewitt, 2004b). In contrast, our knowledge of such patterns is far\nmore limited for the southern hemisphere. We investigated the\nphylogeography of a southern hemisphere seabird group\u2014the\nsouthern skua complex\u2014inhabiting South America, New Zealand,\nsub-antarctic islands and Antarctica and show the close connection\nof its diversification with Antarctic glaciation.\nSkuas (Stercoraridae) are gull-like seabirds inhabiting temper-\nate and polar habitats on both hemispheres. Despite considerable\nresearch effort, the phylogenetic history of skuas remains enig-\nmatic (Andersson, 1973; Blechschmidt et al., 1993; Cohen et al.,\n1997; Andersson, 1999a; Andersson, 1999b). Although the threell rights reserved.\n.S. et al., Phylogeography o\npev.2008.07.014small species of the northern hemisphere (Stercorarius spp.) are\nsimilar to each other and clearly differentiated from the Great Skua\n(Catharacta skua) of the northern hemisphere and all taxa breeding\nat the southern hemisphere, a mitochondrial DNA phylogeny re-\nvealed a closer relatedness of the Great Skua to one of the small\nnorthern skuas, the Pomarine Skua (S. pomarinus), than to any of\nthe southern taxa (Blechschmidt et al., 1993; Cohen et al., 1997).\nThe southern taxa formed a monophyletic clade with very short\nand shallow branches implying a recent and rapid colonization of\nthe southern hemisphere. The aim of our study was to resolve\nthe relationships between the southern skuas and to reconstruct\nthe pattern and modes of colonization.\nAlthough unraveling the enigmatic relationship between Great\nSkua and Pomarine Skua is beyond the scope of this study, this\nquestion has implications for understanding the role of the south-\nern hemisphere during skua evolution. Based on the consensus\nthat the Stercorarius-like skua form is the ancestral one, then the\nGreat Skua may have diverged first and later colonized the south-\nern hemisphere. Another possibility is a southern colonization by\nStercorarius-like founders, a morphological shift towards larger\nsize and dark plumage and a subsequent re-colonization of the\nnorthern hemisphere involving extensive hybridisation and back-\ncrossing with Stercorarius-like skuas. The second possibility has\nled to considerable speculation as to the ancestor of the Great Skuaf the southern skua complex\u2014rapid colonization of the ..., Mol.\n2 M.S.

Various arguments involving geographic prox-\nimity, morphology, coloration and migration pattern favor either\nthe Tristan Skua (Fisher and Lockley, 1954), the Chilean Skua\n(Swales, 1965) or the Falkland Skua (Furness, 1987) as closest rel-\native of the Great Skua.\nThe southern hemisphere skuas are sometimes treated as a\nsuperspecies and the complex currently consists of three described\nspecies of which one, Catharacta antarctica, is sub-divided into\nthree sub-species (Devillers, 1978; del Hoyo, 1996). The distribu-\ntion of these five taxa is shown in Fig. 1. The South Polar Skua\n(Catharacta maccormicki) and the three sub-species Falkland Skua\n(C. a. antarctica), Tristan Skua (C. a. hamiltoni) and Brown Skua (C.\na. lonnbergi) are relatively similar to each other with a brown to\ngreyish plumage and varying degrees of white spots at the backFig. 1.

The most distinct southern skua\nis the Chilean Skua (C. chilensis) with a black cap, cinnamon under-\nparts and underwing-coverts and a gull-like behavior. A detailed\nmorphological description of the taxa is given in Furness (1987).\nAll taxa have relatively small population sizes ranging from 2500\npairs of Tristan Skua to 5000\u20138000 pairs of South Polar Skua (Fur-\nness, 1987; del Hoyo, 1996).\nIn accordance with the supposed recent origin and an incom-\nplete divergence of the southern taxa, evidence of hybridisation ex-\nists for all species pairs. The largest range overlap with extensive\nhybridisation is found in the area of the Antarctic Peninsula be-\ntween South Polar Skua and Brown Skua (Ritz et al., 2006). Up to\n12% of breeding pairs in populations within a 500 km wide hybrid\nzone consist of a South Polar Skua male and a Brown Skua female.sample size.

Ritz et al. \/Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution xxx (2008) xxx\u2013xxx 3\nARTICLE IN PRESSThose pairs produce viable offspring that can reproduce success-\nfully (Pietz, 1987; Parmelee, 1988). Evidence for hybridisation be-\ntween the two taxa comes also from the opposite side of\nAntarctica, from Edmonson Point at the western edge of the Ross\nSea. A mixed pair bred there among 120 South Polar Skua pairs\nin several seasons in the late 1990s (Francesco Pezzo pers. comm.).\nA hybrid zone involving just a few pairs exists between Chilean\nSkua and Falkland Skua at the Patagonian Atlantic coast. Hybrids\nare viable but nothing is known about their fitness (Devillers,\n1978; Yorio, 2005). Although populations of Chilean Skua and\nSouth Polar Skua are separated by the 1000 km wide Drake Pas-\nsage, hybridisation between these two taxa also occurs. An F1-hy-\nbrid has bred successfully since at least 1994 at Potter Peninsula\/\nKing George Island (Reinhardt et al., 1997). Hybridisation involving\nthe Tristan Skua has not been reported but could easily remain\nundetected due to the very similar morphology of the sub-species.\nAlthough formulating hypotheses about the pattern of diversifi-\ncation of the southern skua taxa is difficult due to the unresolved\nrelationship between the northern and southern hemisphere\nskuas, some predictions about the phylogeographic structure of\nthe southern taxa can be made. The structuring should be less pro-\nnounced in taxa with small population size inhabiting small ranges\n(Tristan Skua) and strongest in taxa with larger population sizes\nand a wider distribution (South Polar Skua, Brown Skua). Further-\nmore, the Brown Skua breeding on remote islands in both the Ant-\narctic and sub-antarctic can be expected to have a more complex\nphylogeographic structure than the South Polar Skua which pri-\nmarily inhabits the continental Antarctic coastline. This prediction\nalso arises considering long-term climatic oscillations (Mila-\nnkovitsch cycles) which repeatedly force species breeding at high\nlatitude to retreat from and re-colonize areas affected by ice ages\n(Dynesius and Jansson, 2000; Hewitt, 2000; Hewitt, 2004a).2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Samples\nBlood, tissue or feathers were taken from 270 breeding adults or\nchicks from 16 populations of southern hemisphere skuas. Only\none chick per clutch was sampled and adults were only sampled\nif their chicks had not been sampled. Sample locations and sample\nsizes can be seen in Fig. 1. In addition, DNA was analyzed from all\nfour northern hemisphere skua taxa. This included 12 individuals\nof C. skua from Iceland, NW-Scotland and Foula\/Shetland Islands,\n6 ind. of S. pomarinus from Taimyr Peninsula, 4 ind. of S. longicau-\ndus from Taimyr Peninsula and the upper Anadyr river and 2 ind. of\nS. parasiticus from Churchill\/Canada and Franz-Josef-Land.\n2.2. PCR and sequencing\nA 386 bp segment of the hypervariable region 1 in the mito-\nchondrial control region (CR I) was amplified using a similar proce-\ndure as in Liebers et al. (2001). In a first step a 2500\u20133000 bp long\nfragment which included the entire control region, the ND6 gene\nand a part of the 12S rRNA gene was amplified using primers H2\n(50-GCC ATC CTA CGC TCA ATC CCC AAC AA-30) and DDL-C (50-\nCAC CGC CAA GTC CTT AGA GTT T-30) and the Expand Long\ntemplate PCR system (Roche) followed by a 15 min digestion with\nExoSap (Amersham). PCR conditions were varied slightly with a\ndenaturation temperature of 93 \u0003C and an annealing temperature\nof 55 \u0003C. After the second PCR with the IRD-labelled primer HLB\n(50-GGC CCT GAC ATA GGA ACC AGA GG-30), the samples were\nrun on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in a Licor 4200 sequencer. All se-\nquences were checked manually for ambiguities and aligned with\nClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994).Please cite this article in press as: Ritz, M.S. et al., Phylogeography o\nPhylogenet. Evol. (2008), doi:10.1016\/j.ympev.2008.07.0142.3. Phylogeographic analysis\nFive complementary methods were combined to gain insight\ninto historical demographic processes as well as genetic patterns\nof female-mediated gene flow in the southern skuas.\nThe model of sequence evolution was chosen using Modeltest\n3.7 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) and PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swofford,\n2000). The transition\/transversion ratio was 3.14, nucleotide base\nfrequencies were A = 0.297, C = 0.307, G = 0.143, T = 0.253 and the\nmodel with the highest likelihood was the Hasegawa\u2013Kishino\u2013\nYano model (HKY, Hasegawa et al., 1985) with invariable sites\n(I = 0.737) and a gamma distributed substitution rate of variable\nsites (gamma a = 0.751). This translates into a rate heterogeneity\namong sites of q = 0.887 (Gu et al., 1995). Because the HKY model\nis not available in Arlequin 3.11, the genetic distance matrix was\ncomputed from the alignment using the similar Tamura & Nei\nmodel (Tamura and Nei, 1993) with a gamma distribution.\n2.4. Nested clade phylogeographic analysis (NCPA)\nThe initial haplotype network was constructed with TCS 1.21\n(Clement et al., 2000) including gaps as fifths character state. To\nresolve cladogram ambiguities we applied criteria derived from\ncoalescent theory (Crandall and Templeton, 1993; Pfenninger and\nPosada, 2002): haplotypes are more likely to be connected to hapl-\notypes (1) of high frequency (frequency criterion) (2) interior of the\ncladogram (topological criterion) (3) from the same population or\ngeographically close populations (geographical criterion). Nested\nclade analysis and interpretation of the retrieved deviations from\nthe null hypothesis was done automatically using ANeCA 1.0\n(Panchal, 2007) to decrease subjectivity of the procedure. The\nprogram uses GeoDis 2.2 (Posada et al., 2000; Posada et al., 2006)\nand a revised version of the inference key published by Templeton\n(1998) (available at http:\/\/darwin.uvigo.es\/software\/geodis.html).\nANeCA is not able to resolve cladogram ambiguities following the\nabove mentioned rules. Instead, the program deals with ambigui-\nties by including them into clades during the nesting process\nwhich has the advantage of paying the tolls for uncertainties in\nthe network but the disadvantage of strongly reducing power for\nthe detection of phylogeographic patterns, especially if loops in-\nvolve more than a few mutations. ANeCA was therefore run with\nthe original network as well as with the network with manually re-\nsolved ambiguities. During the renewed debate about whether\nNCPA is a valid statistical method (Panchal and Beaumont, 2007;\nGarrick et al., 2008; Petit, 2008a; Petit, 2008b, Templeton, online\nfirst), Templeton supposed that the high rate of false positives de-\ntected by Panchal and Beaumont (2007) may be due to their sim-\nulations and\/or their invalidated implementation of NCPA in\nANeCA. All positive inferences in the skua data set were, therefore,\nrechecked manually and were confirmed.\n2.5. AMOVA\nPopulation structure was deduced from analysis of molecular\nvariances (AMOVA) in Arlequin 3.11 (Excoffier et al., 2005).\nSeveral groupings of populations were tested in order to maxi-\nmize the among-group variance component (UCT), i.e. to find\nthe grouping that best explains the variance in the sequence\ndata. Not every possible grouping could be tested and instead,\ngroupings resulting from non-genetic knowledge (i.e. taxonomy)\nwere used as well as groupings arisen from the NCA analysis or\nrevealed by a SANOVA (Dupanloup et al., 2002). Differentiation\nbetween the groups was tested with conventional FST statistics\nand 1000 permutations as well as with an exact test (Raymond\nand Rousset, 1995) using 100,000 Markov chain steps and a\n\u2018\u2018burn-in\u201d of 10,000 steps.f the southern skua complex\u2014rapid colonization of the ..., Mol.\n4 M.S.

Fu\u2019s FS and Tajima\u2019s D test for neutral expectations\nFu\u2019s FS (Fu, 1994) and Tajima\u2019s D (Tajima, 1989) test statistic\ncheck the conformation of the data to neutral evolution. Large sig-\nnificant values indicate a deviation from neutrality. For example,\npast increases in population size usually lead to an excess of rare\nalleles and result in negative FS-values.\n2.7. Mismatch distribution\nTo reveal whether populations underwent a historical popula-\ntion expansion, the observed frequency distribution of pairwise\nnucleotide differences among individuals (i.e. mismatch distribu-\ntion, Rogers and Harpending, 1992) was compared with the ex-\npected distribution from a population expansion model using\nArlequin 3.11 (Excoffier et al., 2005) in populationswith at least five\nsequenced individuals. The parameters for a spatial expansion\nmodel were calculated likewise. Harpending\u2019s raggedness index\n(r) was used to test for a deviation from unimodality of the mis-\nmatch distribution.\nThe expansion event was dated using the formula s = 2ut where\nu = l (mutation rate per site and year) \u0002 k (sequence length). Due\nto the absence of an l-estimate for the mitochondrial CR I in skuas,\nthe mutation rate of this gene in the closely related large gulls\n(Larus spec.) was used (l = 4.24 \u0002 10\u00038, Liebers and Helbig,\n2002). The 95%-confidence interval around s was calculated with\nparametric bootstrapping as implemented in Arlequin 3.11.\n2.8. Divergence times and gene flow\nThe statistical method implemented in the IM software calcu-\nlates the divergence time of two populations simultaneously with\nthe number of migrants between them (Nielsen and Wakeley,\n2001; Hey and Nielsen, 2004). Furthermore, a new version of the\nprogram can account for unequal sizes of founder populations\nand population size changes (Hey, 2005). A disadvantage is the\nprogram\u2019s inability to deal with indels. The program was run for\n30 population pairs for which an \u2018\u2018isolation with migration\u201d model\nseems reasonably assuming a finite sites mutation model (Hase-\ngawa et al., 1985). A pre-run including the splitting parameter\nwas run for each population pair with 100,000 burnin steps,\n1,000,000 sampling steps, tmax = 20,Mmax = 50 and h = 50. Different\nheating schemes and numbers of Markov chains were tested to ex-\nplore the parameter space and check for sufficient Markov chain\nmixing. The final three runs with different random seeds consisted\nof ten Markov chains, 40 chain sweep attempts per step, a geomet-\nric heating scheme (g1 = 0.95, g2 = 0.8), 200,000 burnin steps, three\nto ten million sampling steps and the prior range adjusted accord-\ning to the results from the pre-runs. The posterior density curves\nfor parameter t (divergence time) had two clear peaks in a few\ncases with the estimate from the second peak always being much\nlarger than the estimated TMRCA (time to most recent common\nancestor). The parameter space was then restricted to include the\nfirst peak only. These settings resulted in effective sample size\n(ESS) estimates larger than 50 for all parameters and the absence\nof any trend in the parameter trendlines.3. Results\n3.1.

The sequence of the most\nfrequent haplotype is deposited in GenBank (Accession No.\nEU636796). The complete haplotype list with the assignment to\nthe taxa is given in Table S1. There are no fixed differences be-\ntween the species or the five taxa.\n3.2. Nested clade phylogeographic analysis\nTCS estimated the 95% connection limit to be eight mutational\nsteps and constructed two separate networks for the outgroup taxa\nwhich were 11 (C. skua + S. pomarinus) and 38 (S. parasiticus + S.\nlongicaudus) steps away from the southern taxa network, respec-\ntively (Fig. 2). No clade in the network of the southern taxa got\nan outgroup weight higher than 0.1. The network was highly retic-\nulate with 132 ambiguous edges (i.e. involved in loops) out of 194\nedges. Although all loops could be resolved following the three\nrules described above, the differences that led to an assignment\nof haplotypes to a clade and not to another were often subtle. In\nsome cases adopting a pathway with one more step or a slightly\nless likely step would have changed the position of major clades\nin the cladogram. The GeoDis statistics and the inference key can-\nnot account for such uncertainties in the cladogram and the results\nfrom the inference key have to be interpreted with some caution in\nsuch a case. Two alternative connections are shown in Fig. 2 and\nthe GeoDis analysis was also run for the three alternatively re-\nsolved networks to compare the phylogeographic inferences.\nThe network showed no clear separation of the currently de-\nscribed taxa and especially haplotypes of South Polar Skua and\nBrown Skua are virtually spread all over it. The Tristan Skua was\nfound in a private haplotype containing 15 individuals (clade 2\u2013\n16) and in two other places at least 8 steps away from that clade.\nThe Falkland Skua is also relative homogeneous with samples from\nthe Patagonian continent found at the tips but one haplotype\nplaced between Brown Skua haplotypes from Marion Island (clade\n3\u20133). Chilean Skua haplotypes are found in close connection with\nSouth Polar Skua and Brown Skua (clade 2\u20131) but also at the tips\nof clade 3\u20137 near Tristan Skua haplotypes. Nested clade phylogeo-\ngraphic analysis revealed several events of contiguous range\nexpansion and restricted gene flow with isolation by distance for\nthe southern skuas (Table 1). Only four inferences could be made\nfor the unresolved network, of which two (for clade 1-7 and 2-8)\nwere identical to the presented network. The other two referred\nto slightly modified versions of clade 3-5 and 3-7 and identified\n\u2018\u2018allopatric fragmentation\u201d and \u2018\u2018restricted gene flow with isolation\nby distance\u201d as key events. Inferences from the network with two\nambiguous connections shown in Fig. 2 were identical for all but\nfour higher order clades. No phylogeographic pattern was found\nfor clade 3-2 and 4-2 and \u2018\u2018contiguous range expansion\u201d was found\nfor the two 5-step clades but their nesting design was different.\nThe three alternatively resolved networks gave very similar results.\nThe inferred \u2018\u2018long-distance colonization\u201d refers to Tristan Skuas\ncolonizing Patagonia and giving rise to the Chilean Skua. However,\na South Polar Skua haplotype with five individuals from Rothera,\nDavis and Mirny was also found in this clade.\n3.3. AMOVA\nNearly two third of the variance in the sequence data is\nexplained by variation within populations irrespective of which\ngrouping is applied (Table 2). Only 9.1% of the variance is explained\nby the grouping representing the current taxonomic species affili-\nation. More than one quarter (28.6%) of the variance component is\ndue to variation among populations within groups. Treating all five\ndescribed taxa (3 species and 2 sub-species) equally increases the\nvariance component of FCT to 11.1%.

In contrast, the Brown Skua\npopulation at Chatham Island\/New Zealand is remarkably well dif-\nferentiated from the neighboring populations (1000\u20133700 km dis-\ntant) with divergence time estimates of 143,000\u2013115,000 yBP. The\nSouth Polar Skua population in East Antarctica (Davis station) is\nwell differentiated from the Brown Skua population at the sub-ant-\narctic Marion Island. These two populations are approximately\n4200 km apart. Maternal gene flow is biased for many population\npairs and unidirectional for South Polar Skua populations.

Skuas and gulls are close relatives although their detailed\nphylogenetic relationship remains controversial (Ericson et al.,\n2003; Paton et al., 2003; Thomas et al., 2004a; Thomas et al.,\n2004b). Confidence-intervals of TMRCA estimates are usually largePlease cite this article in press as: Ritz, M.S. et al., Phylogeography o\nPhylogenet. Evol. (2008), doi:10.1016\/j.ympev.2008.07.014(Basu and Majumder, 2003, Fig. 5) and single estimates are there-\nfore difficult to assign to practicably narrow time windows. How-\never, the combination of estimates from 30 population pairs\nconsistently predicted the diversification of southern skuas to have\ntaken place during about 210,000 to 150,000 yBP (Fig. 5). This time\nperiod coincides well with a glacial period in Antarctica between\n230,000 and 140,000 yBP. Due to the time lag between tempera-\nture and a response of the Antarctic ice body, the Antarctic ice\nshield was estimated to be smallest at around 210,000 yBP and\nbuilt up continuously until 140,000 yBP (Oerlemans, 2005). The\nincreasing ice load of Antarctica pushed the continent down and\nthe ice-bonded water resulted in a sea level drop of 80\u2013120 m be-\ntween interglacials (Jouzel et al., 2007). Furthermore, isostatic gla-\nciation models predict that the sinking Antarctic continent induced\nnorthbound flows of magma causing a small forebulge within a\n200\u20131000 km wide zone around the ice grounding line (Lambeck,\n1993; Parizek and Alley, 2004). In summary, availability of nesting\nhabitats at the Antarctic continent was comparable to the recent\nsituation at around 210,000 yBP but decreased continuously after-\nwards. Many of the remaining ice-free parts of Antarctica were\nprobably not usable by skuas because the sea ice zone extended\nfar north and inhibited foraging. At the same time, more (and lar-\nger) sub-antarctic areas became available. This pattern fits well\nwith the pattern of diversification of southern skuas. South Polar\nSkuas spread all around Antarctica when the continent provided\nhabitable conditions. With decreasing temperatures and increasing\nglaciation skuas were forced to colonize sub-antarctic islands and\nreached the current distribution at the glacial maximum. South\nPolar Skuas most likely survived this period in Antarctic refuges.\nThe allopatric fragmentation combined with different ecological\nconditions then resulted in population divergence and subsequent\nspeciation.\nAlthough rooting of the haplotype network is unreliable if the\noutgroup is far away from the ingroup (Castelloe and Templeton,\n1994; Tarrio et al., 2000; Cassens et al., 2003) it is notable that\nthe northern hemisphere skuas form two outgroups rather than\none. Furthermore, these two groups are connected to the network\non opposite sides. This is in agreement with an assumed coloniza-\ntion of the southern hemisphere by a small northern species and a\nsubsequent re-colonization of the northern hemisphere by a south-\nern-like skua leading to C. skua.\nIdentification of the most ancestral southern skua taxa involves\na degree of speculation. The S. parasiticus\/S. longicaudus group con-\nnects to the southern network via South Polar Skua haplotypes\nfrom East Antarctica (clade 2\u201318) but is 38 mutational steps away\nand therefore cannot be relied upon. Support for the South Polar\nSkua as the ancestor of the southern skuas comes from ecological\nand morphological consideration. The South Polar Skua is the only\nsouthern taxon known to regularly migrate to the northern hemi-\nsphere (Furness, 1987, own unpublished data). It is also the lightest\nand most long-winged southern taxon and is generally described\nas slender and gracile in comparison to the more bulky appearance\nof, for example the Brown Skua (Furness, 1987). In addition, esti-\nmates of TMRCA for population pairs also point to the South Polar\nSkua as oldest taxon. The separation start of South Polar Skua pop-\nulations is estimated to be before 185,000 yBP. The time estimates\nfor the three South Polar Skua population pairs are nearly identical,\ncorresponding to a rapid spread of the species around the Antarctic\ncontinent. However, the start of the genetic divergence between\nSouth Polar Skua and Brown Skua populations seems to have been\nat approximately the same time as that between the South Polar\nSkua populations. In conclusion, although other possibilities can-\nnot be excluded with complete confidence, the most likely scenario\nincludes the South Polar Skua as oldest southern skua taxon.\nOur findings support a colonization scenario for Tristan da\nCunha from Brown Skua populations.

TMRCA estimates date around 150,000 yBP\nbut a larger sample size is needed to confirm this. Furthermore,\nthe geographic position of the Falklands, and the overlap in non-\nbreeding distribution of Falkland Skua with Brown Skua (Phillips\net al., 2007) suggests a higher likelihood of genetic exchange with\nother taxa, potentially hampering the exact disclosure of historic\nprocesses. However, glaciation of Antarctica was near its maxi-\nmum at 150,000 yBP whilst the Falklands were probably never\nheavily glaciated (McDowall, 2005). This may have facilitated col-\nonization of the Falklands from skua populations at the Antarctic\nPeninsula, South Georgia and the Patagonian fjords. The Chilean\nSkua also seems to be of comparably recent origin and haplotypes\nare found at the tips of the haplotype network implying a coloniza-\ntion of South America from Tristan da Cunha and Brown Skua\npopulations.\nIn conclusion, the most parsimonious colonization scenario of\nthe southern hemisphere is the following: a Stercorarius-like ances-\ntor founded a southern population, subsequently spread around\nAntarctica and split into C. maccormicki and C. a. lonnbergi approx-\nimately 200,000 years ago. The Tristan da Cunha archipelago was\nprobably colonized from sub-antarctic island populations. Another\nlong distance colonization event led to the Chilean Skua at the\nSouth American continent. The Falkland Skua is most likely a prod-\nuct of immigration from multiple populations at around\n150,000 yBP.\nThe outgroup comprising C. skua and S. pomarinus is only 11\nsteps from the network, which corresponds to a 91.7% parsimony\nprobability. Interestingly, the connection is to New Zealand Brown\nSkuas (clade 3\u20135) implying again a re-colonization of the northern\nhemisphere via the Pacific. But this seems unlikely considering the\nabsence of Great Skuas from eastern Siberia and the (current) non-\nmigratory behavior of New Zealand skuas. However, migratory\ntendencies, or lack of them, can evolve amazingly rapidly and have\nbeen proposed as a special route to speciation (Berthold et al.,\n1992; West-Eberhard, 2003; Bearhop et al., 2005; Kondo et al.,\n2008). Additional (nuclear) markers may help to solve this mystery\nin the future.\nConclusions about demographic processes and phylogeographic\nstructure of taxa have to be interpreted with caution if the popula-\ntion history of these taxa is (potentially) complex (Wakeley andPlease cite this article in press as: Ritz, M.S. et al., Phylogeography o\nPhylogenet. Evol. (2008), doi:10.1016\/j.ympev.2008.07.014Hey, 1998; Knowles, 2004). Population sub-division can result in\nragged mismatch distributions (Marjoram and Donnelly, 1994)\nand impede the uncovering of historical demographic processes.\nIn Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, for example, range expansion\nerased phylogeographic structure (Ritchie et al., 2004). Our data\nshow that the history of southern skua populations has indeed\nbeen eventful. Nearly all populations have undergone demographic\nand\/or spatial expansions. Mismatch distributions show that the\ndemographic histories of skua populations have been different\neven if the populations are in proximity and exchange genes. For\nexample, the timing of a population size change was different for\nBrown Skua populations from Bird Island and Signy Island, respec-\ntively. Whilst a substantial population size change occurred at\nChatham Islands, such an event was absent or at least much more\nrecent in the skua population at the other New Zealand island\u2014\nCampbell Island (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, nested clade phylogeo-\ngraphic analysis provides evidence that contiguous range expan-\nsion and restricted gene flow with isolation by distance have\nbeen important processes during the evolution of southern skuas.\nThe inferred events were largely insensitive to alternative connec-\ntions in the haplotype network. Given the circumpolar distribution\nof skuas and the occupancy of remote islands, these results are not\nunexpected.\nIn agreement with predictions from long-term climatic oscilla-\ntions (Milankovitsch cycles) and geographic considerations, the\nSouth Polar Skua is considerably less phylogeographically struc-\ntured than the Brown Skua. Whether this difference is due to the\ntwo glacials having greater effects on the South Polar Skua or the\ndisjunctive distribution of the Brown Skua at sub-antarctic islands\npromoting differentiation cannot be answered easily.\nThe very recent estimates for population divergence times and\nthe ongoing gene flow highlights the need to distinguish between\nthe timing of allelic divergence (gene coalescence, TMRCA) and the\ntiming of population divergence (s). TMRCA always predates the\ncessation of gene flow and the time lag between these two events\ncan vary considerably between population pairs (Edwards and\nBeerli, 2000). Although the South Polar Skua and the Brown Skua\nwere most likely the first taxa which separated, the two taxa still\nexchange genes in an extensive hybrid zone (Ritz et al., 2006,\nFig. 4) and population differentiation is still incomplete after\n200,000 years. On the other hand, Brown Skuas from Chatham Is-\nland\/New Zealand are remarkably well differentiated even from\nthe neighboring population at Campbell Island (Table 5).

Ritz et al. \/Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution xxx (2008) xxx\u2013xxx 11\nARTICLE IN PRESSZealand skuas are unusual in that many, particularly those from the\nChatham Islands, are year-round residents at the colony (Furness,\n1987; Hemmings, 1990). The absence of substantial migration\nmay have led to an especially low dispersal frequency of skuas from\nthe Chatham Islands (Young, 1998) and a resulting low gene ex-\nchange with other populations (Friesen et al., 2007). In contrast,\nboth tracking data and band recoveries indicate overlap in winter-\ning ranges of Falklands Skuas and Brown Skuas from several South\nAtlantic colonies (Phillips et al., 2007, authors unpublished data).\nFurthermore, the small population size of c. 130 breeding pairs\n(del Hoyo, 1996; Young, 1998) at the Chatham Islands favors\ninbreeding and bottleneck effects. A further reduction of gene flow\nmay be caused by the extraordinary high frequency of cooperative\nbreeding in this population (Hemmings, 1994).\nThe status of the Brown Skua population at Macquarie Island de-\nserves special attention. Brown Skuas from this island are well dif-\nferentiated from Brown Skuas of the two New Zealand populations\nand experienced immigration from South Polar Skuas. This is\nremarkable because current and historical gene flow between\nBrown Skua and South Polar Skua is mostly the other way around\n(Parmelee, 1988; Ritz et al., 2006, Fig. 4). This pattern probably ar-\nose from the recent dramatic population history. Animal based oil\nproduction at Macquarie Island until 1920 resulted almost in the\nextinction of seals and penguins as an important food source for\nSkuas (Cumpston, 1968). Therefore, the Brown Skua population size\nat Macquarie Island was most likely much reduced until c. 1940\nwhen seal and bird population recovered. In the case of Brown\nSkuas, the recovery by intrinsic population growth was probably\nsupported by immigration from more southerly population and\nnot from New Zealand populations which were then in decline, too.\n4.1. Taxonomy\nOur data confirm significant differences between the currently\ndescribed taxa. But many populations still exchange genes with\npopulations from other taxa although at a lower rate than with\npopulations from the same taxon. Depending on which species\nconcept is applied, the southern skuas could be lumped into one\nspecies, C. antarctica, or the three current sub-species could be gi-\nven species status. However, the current taxonomy does not reflect\ndiversity at the molecular (maternal) level within the Brown Skua\nC. a. lonnbergi. Some sets of populations of C. a. lonnbergi are well\ndifferentiated from each other. This can be seen as evidence that\nthis taxon should be further sub-divided to give e.g. New Zealand\nSkuas the same status as Tristan Skuas. However, further sampling\nfrom e.g. South Sandwich Islands, Bouvet Island and Kerguelen Is-\nland would be needed to judge whether Atlantic and Indian Ocean\nBrown Skua populations are indeed different. The more likely sce-\nnario is a cline over the taxon\u2019s vast range.\nOur results give more evidence for a \u2018\u2018once around the world\u201d\nspeciation scenario within the skuas Stercoraridae, than for the\nacquisition of the Great Skua-like morphology twice (in the Great\nSkua and the southern taxa). This argues for the retention of the\ngenus name Catharacta. However, these side results of our study\nhave no statistically strong support and more research effort is\nneeded to resolve the exciting enigma surrounding the phyloge-\nnetic positions of S. pomarinus and C. skua.5. Conclusions\nOf course, our data only reveal the matrilineal aspect of popula-\ntion histories (Ballard and Whitlock, 2004) and could be supple-\nmented by multi-locus nuclear marker data that would better\naccount for gene flow effected by male emigration and immigra-\ntion (Edwards and Beerli, 2000).Please cite this article in press as: Ritz, M.S. et al., Phylogeography o\nPhylogenet.

Skuas probably first inhabited the\nAntarctic continent, spread to the sub-antarctic islands and Tristan\nda Cunha and finally colonized the Patagonian coast and the\nFalkland Islands at the glacial maximum. Most populations show\nsigns of strong population size changes and still exchange genes\nwith neighboring populations of other taxa. After a rapid coloniza-\ntion of the southern hemisphere, evolution of southern skua taxa is\n(still) reticulate and speciation incomplete. Indeed, the southern\nskua complex may serve as model system for recently evolved taxa\nto get deeper insights into processes and patterns in the early\nphase of speciation.\nAcknowledgments\nFor providing samples we thank Yuri Mizin and Maria Gavrilo\n(Mirny station), Mike Dunn (Signy Island), Peter Moore (Campbell\nIsland), Katherin Snell (Rothera) and Euan Young (New Zealand,\nRoss Island).
