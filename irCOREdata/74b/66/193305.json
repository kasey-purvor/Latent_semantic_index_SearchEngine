One day prior to blastocyst formation,\nthe eight-cell embryo undergoes compaction, a morphogenetic\nchange characterized by the flattening of blastomeres against\neach other and establishment of E-cadherin-dependent\nbasolateral cell-cell adhesion. Blastomeres acquire apicobasal\npolarity typified by apical localization of microvilli and\nacquisition of cytoplasmic polarity (Fleming et al., 2001; Pratt\net al., 1982; Reeve and Ziomek, 1981). In subsequent cell\ndivisions, outer cells remain polarized and generate the TE\nepithelium. During blastocyst formation, the TE cells form a\ntransporting epithelium, with functional adherens and tight\njunctions (Fleming et al., 2001). The activity of sodium pumps\n(Na+, K+-ATPases) leads to establishment of ionic gradients\nacross the TE and accumulation of fluid in the forming\nblastocoel cavity (Watson, 1992). In addition, aquaporins\ncontribute to water movements across the TE, leading to\nblastocoel expansion (Barcroft et al., 2003). After hatching\nfrom the zona pellucida, a subpopulation of TE cells \u2013 the\nmural TE cells \u2013 exhibit increased protrusive activity and\nundergo changes in cell polarity through relocalization of\nproteins such as integrin \u03b15\u03b21 and integrin \u03b17\u03b21 from basal\nto apical domains (reviewed by Sutherland et al., 2003). At this\nstage, cells in the ICM have segregated into the epiblast, or\nembryonic lineage, and the primitive endoderm (PE), or extra-\nembryonic endoderm lineage.\nFollowing implantation, cells overlying the ICM \u2013 the polar\nTE \u2013 continue to proliferate and form the extra-embryonic\nectoderm (ExE) that contains trophoblast stem (TS) cells\n(Tanaka et al., 1998) and the diploid ectoplacental cone (EPC),\nwhile the mural cells cease division and form trophoblast giant\ncells. Further differentiation of the trophoblast lineage\ngenerates the labyrinth, spongiotrophoblast and glycogen cells\nof the mature chorioallantoic placenta (Rossant and Cross,\n2001).\nIdentification of the molecular components required for the\ninitial segregation of the TE and ICM lineages has been\nelusive, as few mutations have been found to cause early\nlineage-specific defects. Oct4 (Pou5f1), a POU domain\ntranscription factor (TF), is required for maintenance of ICM\nfate and pluripotency of ES cells (Nichols et al., 1998; Niwa\net al., 2000). Oct4 is expressed in all blastomeres of the\ncleavage stage embryo, but becomes restricted to the ICM after\ninitiation of blastocyst formation (Palmieri et al., 1994).\nHomozygous mutant Oct4 embryos develop to the blastocyst\nstage, but their isolated ICM cells express trophectoderm\nmarkers when outgrown in vitro (Nichols et al., 1998).\nFurthermore, conditional repression of Oct4 in ES cells leads\nBlastocyst formation marks the segregation of the first two\ncell lineages in the mammalian preimplantation embryo:\nthe inner cell mass (ICM) that will form the embryo proper\nand the trophectoderm (TE) that gives rise to the\ntrophoblast lineage. Commitment to ICM lineage is\nattributed to the function of the two transcription factors,\nOct4 (encoded by Pou5f1) and Nanog. However, a positive\nregulator of TE cell fate has not been described. The T-box\nprotein eomesodermin (Eomes) and the caudal-type\nhomeodomain protein Cdx2 are expressed in the TE, and\nboth Eomes and Cdx2 homozygous mutant embryos die\naround the time of implantation. A block in early TE\ndifferentiation occurs in Eomes mutant blastocysts.\nHowever, Eomes mutant blastocysts implant, and Cdx2 and\nOct4 expression are correctly restricted to the ICM TE.\nBlastocoel formation initiates in Cdx2 mutants but\nepithelial integrity is not maintained and embryos fail to\nimplant. Loss of Cdx2 results in failure to downregulate\nOct4 and Nanog in outer cells of the blastocyst and\nsubsequent death of those cells. Thus, Cdx2 is essential for\nsegregation of the ICM and TE lineages at the blastocyst\nstage by ensuring repression of Oct4 and Nanog in the TE.\nKey words: Trophoblast, Stem cells, Pou5f1, Oct4, Eomesodermin,\nNanog, Mouse\nSummary\nCdx2 is required for correct cell fate specification and\ndifferentiation of trophectoderm in the mouse blastocyst\nDan Strumpf1, Chai-An Mao1,*, Yojiro Yamanaka1, Amy Ralston1, Kallayanee Chawengsaksophak1,\nFelix Beck2 and Janet Rossant1,3,\u2020\n1Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, 600 University Avenue, Toronto M5G 1X5, Ontario, Canada \n2Department of Biochemistry, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK\n3Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto M5S 1A8, Ontario, Canada\n*Present address: Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA\n\u2020Author for correspondence (e-mail: rossant@mshri.on.ca)\nAccepted 22 February 2005\nDevelopment 132, 2093-2102\nPublished by The Company of Biologists 2005\ndoi:10.1242\/dev.01801\nResearch article\nD\nev\nel\nop\nm\nen\nt\n2094\nto differentiation into trophoblast morphology and an increase\nin expression of trophoblast-specific markers (Niwa et al.,\n2000; Hay et al., 2004). Culturing these cells under conditions\nthat promote trophoblast proliferation generated cells\napparently equivalent to TS cells (Niwa et al., 2000).\nNanog, a homeobox gene, is also expressed in the ICM at\n3.5 days post-coitum (dpc) and becomes epiblast-specific in the\nimplanting blastocyst. Nanog maintains ES cell pluripotency\nindependent of LIF signalling, and in the absence of Nanog,\nES cells and ICMs both differentiate into extra-embryonic\nendoderm (Chambers et al., 2003; Mitsui et al., 2003). Thus,\nNanog has been implicated in repressing the extra-embryonic\nendoderm or PE fate, while Oct4 may function as a repressor\nof the trophoblast cell fate.\nOnly a few TFs show TE-specific expression at the\nblastocyst stage (Beck et al., 1995; Hancock et al., 1999; Luo\net al., 1997; Rossant et al., 1998; Russ et al., 2000), and none\nso far has shown absence of TE formation when mutated\n(Guillemot et al., 1994; Luo et al., 1997; Russ et al., 2000). It\nhas been proposed that the TE develops by default in the\nabsence of Oct4 (Pesce and Scholer, 2001). However, TE\ndifferentiation begins prior to downregulation of Oct4 in the\nouter cells of the nascent blastocyst, suggesting that there\nshould also be positive acting factors promoting TE fate. Cdx2,\na caudal-type homeodomain TF, has been reported to be\nspecifically expressed in TE at blastocyst stage, and expression\nis maintained within the proliferating ExE (Beck et al., 1995).\nHeterozygous Cdx2 mutants show homeotic transformation\ndefects and homozygous mutants die at the peri-implantation\nstage (Chawengsaksophak et al., 1997; Tamai et al., 1999).\nEomesodermin (Eomes), a T-box TF, is also expressed\nspecifically in the TE at the blastocyst stage, and, like Cdx2,\nis expressed at later stages in the ExE (Ciruna and Rossant,\n1999; Hancock et al., 1999; Russ et al., 2000). Eomes mutants\nhave also been reported to show early defects in trophoblast\nproliferation (Russ et al., 2000).\nIn this paper, we compare the Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 and Eomes\u2013\/\u2013 mutant\nphenotypes in more detail, and show that Cdx2 mutant\nblastocysts fail to maintain trophoblast differentiation and fail\nto implant. Interestingly, loss of Cdx2 is associated with failure\nto downregulate Oct4 and Nanog in outer cells of the blastocyst\nand results in subsequent death of outer cells. By contrast,\nEomes mutants form blastocysts, display ICM-restricted Oct4\nexpression and TE-specific Cdx2 expression, but trophoblast\ndoes not differentiate further. Thus, Cdx2 is the earliest TF\nidentified so far to be involved in specification of TE fate, and\nCdx2 is required for repression of Oct4\/Nanog and normal\nblastocyst development.\nMaterials and methods\nTargeting and inactivation of Eomesodermin gene\nMouse Eomes genomic clones were isolated from a strain 129\/sv\ngenomic library. To generate the deletion\/replacement knockout\nconstruct, a 3.4 kb EcoRI fragment encompassing exons 1 and 2 was\nused as left homologous arm, and a 2.1 kb HindIII\/XbaI fragment\ncontaining 3\u2032 UTR as right arm (as shown in Fig. 8A). Electroporated\nR1 ES cell clones were doubly selected with G418 and gancylovir,\nand screened for homologous recombination by Southern blot using\na 500 bp 5\u2032 external probe and verified by a 3\u2032 internal probe (not\nshown). Two positive clones were aggregated with ICR morulae to\ngenerate chimaeric mice, which were then mated with 129 females to\nproduce heterozygotes. Heterozygous knockout mice were maintained\nin either a pure 129 or a 129\/ICR mixed background; no difference\nin phenotype was observed.\nMouse breeding, embryo collection and genotyping\nMice heterozygous for the Cdx2 targeted mutation Cdx2tm1Fbe\n(MGI:1857928) (Chawengsaksophak et al., 1997) were maintained by\ncrossing to outbred ICR strain mice. Embryos were collected from\nintercrossed Cdx2 or Eomes heterozygotes. Genotyping was\nperformed on individually isolated embryos directly or after\nobservation in culture or following in situ hybridization or antibody\nstaining. All genotyping was performed blind by PCR with primers\nthat produced both mutant and wild-type bands, thus ensuring\nunequivocal identification of genotypes. The conditions of PCR\ngenotyping of mice and embryos for Cdx2 targeted mutation\nCdx2tm1Fbe were as previously described (Chawengsaksophak et al.,\n1997). Eomes targeted mutants were genotyped using the following\nprimers (see also Fig. 8A): primer A, (forward primer) 5\u2032-\nGAAAGCGCCTGTCTCCAGCACCC-3\u2032; primer B, (reverse primer)\n5\u2032-AACACTCCTGCGTCCTCCAGTCAC-3\u2032; primer C, (Neor\nforward primer) 5\u2032-CAGCGCATCGCCTCTATCCGCC-3\u2032. A 440 bp\namplification product is generated from the mutant allele between\nprimer C and B; a 350 bp product is amplified from the wild-type\nallele between primers A and B.\nRNA preparation and RT-PCR\nRNA was isolated from single embryos as described (Chomczynski\nand Sacchi, 1987). cDNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript\nII reverse transcriptase according to manufacturer (Invitrogen). cDNA\nwas diluted 1\/10 for semi-quantitative PCR.

To\nvisualize nuclei, embryos were\nincubated in YOYO-1 or YOYO-\n3 (Molecular Probes) at 1:400-\n1:1000 dilution with 10-20 \u00b5g\/ml\nRNAse A, for 15-30 minutes at\nroom temperature.\nEmbryo culture\nTo follow development in vitro,\neight-cell stage embryos were\nflushed from oviducts in M2,\ntreated with acidic Tyrode\u2019s to\nremove zonae pellucidae (Nagy\net al., 2003). The embryos were\nthen cultured in microdrops of\nKSOM-AA under mineral oil for\n48 hours at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and\ntransferred into microdrops of\nRPMI 1640 containing 0.1%\nBSA and 100 \u00b5M non-essential\namino acids for an additional 24\nhours. For trophoblast outgrowth\nformation, 3.5 dpc blastocysts\nfrom heterozygous Cdx2 or\nEomes intercrosses were\nindividually cultured in KSOM-\nAA overnight and then\ntransferred into RPMI 1640\ncontaining 20% FCS in four-well\ntissue culture dishes (Nunc, Denmark) untreated or pre-coated with\n0.1% gelatin (Sigma), fibronectin (from bovine plasma, Sigma; 20\n\u00b5g\/ml in PBS) or laminin (Sigma; 25 \u00b5g\/ml in PBS). Outgrowth\nformation was monitored over 72-120 hours. For digital time-lapse\nmicroscopy, embryos were collected and cultured in KSOM-AA in\nglass-bottom dishes (MatTek, USA) overlaid with light mineral oil\nand imaged using the Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with\nIncubator XL, Heating Insert P and CO2 controller. Temperature and\nCO2 were set to 37.5\u00b0C and 5.5%, respectively. DIC images were\nrecorded, with halogen lamp voltage (<2.5 V), every 30 minutes using\nAxioCam MRm with Axiovision 3.1 software.\nTS cell culture and derivation\nDerivation of trophoblast stem (TS) cell lines from blastocysts from\nheterozygous Cdx2 or Eomes intercrosses was performed as\npreviously described (Tanaka et al., 1998) and as detailed at\nhttp:\/\/www.mshri.on.ca\/rossant\/protocols\/TScells.html. Genotyping\nof cell lines was performed by PCR (for Cdx2) or confirmed by\nSouthern analysis (for Eomes).\nTUNEL staining\nEight-cell embryos were cultured in KSOM-AA for 48 hours, then\nfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature,\nand washed in PBS+0.1% Tween 20, incubated in TUNEL reaction\nmixture (Roche) for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C and washed as above. The\ntotal number of FITC-labelled\/TUNEL-positive nuclei in each\nembryo was scored as well as their distribution in the ICM or TE by\ncounting multiple stacked optical sections.\nResults\nCdx2 expression is detected in the trophectoderm\nprior to implantation\nCdx2 expression was previously reported in the TE of the\nblastocyst and the trophoblast lineage during post-implantation\nstages (Beck et al., 1995). To gain better insight into the role\nof Cdx2 in early development of the trophoblast lineage, we\nfollowed the spatial and temporal dynamics of Cdx2\nexpression from the early morula stage to 5.5 dpc (Fig. 1). By\nRT-PCR analysis, Cdx2 mRNA was first detected at the eight-\ncell stage (not shown), and Cdx2 protein was first clearly\ndetected in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the outer cells of early\nmorula (~16 cells, n=4; Fig. 1A,B) and late morula stages (~25\ncells, n=4; Fig. 1C,D). Some low level of expression was seen\ncytoplasmically throughout the rest of the embryo.\nInterestingly, at these stages Oct4 protein is present equally in\nFig. 1.

At the early blastocyst stage, Cdx2\nexpression was more restricted to the outer cell layer (3.25 dpc\nn=2; Fig. 1E). By the expanded blastocyst stage, Cdx2 protein\nwas exclusively localized to the TE nuclei (3.5 dpc, n=4; Fig.\n1F). At 4.5 dpc, by the onset of implantation, Cdx2 protein\nlevels appeared to be reduced in the mural TE, but maintained\nin the polar TE cells directly overlying the ICM (n=3; Fig. 1G).\nAt later stages, Cdx2 expression became confined to the polar\nTE (nascent ExE) cells directly overlaying the epiblast (4.75\ndpc, n=2; Fig. 1H). By 5.5 dpc both epiblast and ExE have\nexpanded, and intense Cdx2 expression spanned the first three\nor four cell rows in the ExE adjacent to the epiblast (n=2; Fig.\n1I). Cdx2 expression is thus associated with the initiation of\nTE fate, and later specifically delineates the cells of the\ntrophoblast lineage that give rise to TS cells in the peri-\nimplantation embryo (Corson et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 1998).\nA similar expression profile was found for Cdx2 mRNA (see\nFig. S1 in the supplementary material).\nTo determine whether there is any maternal Cdx2 protein in\nthe early embryo, we examined Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos at early\nmorulae and blastocyst stages. There was no nuclear Cdx2\nprotein detectable in Cdx2 mutants at either stage (4 mutant\nmorulae, 5 mutant blastocysts; Fig. 1K,M), compared with\nprominent nuclear expression in Cdx2+\/+ embryos (Fig. 1O).\nSome low level fluorescence was observable in the cytoplasm\nof Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos but whether this is real signal or\nbackground staining is unclear.\nCdx2\u2013\/\u2013 blastocysts fail to maintain blastocoel\nPrevious analysis revealed that Cdx2 homozygous mutant\nembryos die around the time of implantation. Dissection and\ngenotyping of post-implantation stages revealed neither\nevidence of Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 mutants nor any empty deciduae, which is\nindicative of death prior to implantation (Chawengsaksophak et\nal., 1997). We examined the morphology of embryos from\nCdx2+\/\u2013 intercrosses by dissection from the uterus at 4.5 dpc.\nCdx2+\/+ or Cdx2+\/\u2013 blastocysts were recovered and were fully\nexpanded and hatched from their zonae pellucida by this stage\n(n=10). By contrast, Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos recovered were still\nenclosed in their zonae, and had little or no blastocoelic cavity\n(n=4). Blastocyst formation was monitored by culturing zona-\nfree eight-cell stage embryos from Cdx2+\/\u2013 intercrosses over a\ntime course of 72 hours (Fig. 2). Between 24 and 48 hours, all\nembryos had a blastocoel. However, by 72 hours all Cdx2\nmutants (n=4) showed no blastocoelic cavity and surface\nmorphology was rough. Live imaging of litters from Cdx2 +\/\u2013\nintercrosses revealed that the blastocoel of Cdx2 mutants initially\nexpanded, but began to collapse around the time that non-mutant\nlittermates hatch from the zona (three mutants, 18 non-mutants;\nsee Movie 1 in the supplementary material). This collapse was\naccompanied by a morphological change in the TE, as cells\nacquired a rounded, non-epithelial appearance.\nThe trophectoderm of Cdx2 homozygous mutant\nblastocysts fails to maintain epithelial integrity\nTo evaluate the degree of TE differentiation in Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013\nembryos, we examined the expression of TE-specific markers.\nOne of the characteristics of the TE epithelium is the formation\nof tight junctions between the TE cells, which facilitate the\nmaintenance of the blastocoel cavity. As Cdx2 homozygous\nmutants fail to maintain an expanded blastocoel, we examined\nthe expression of the tight junction and adherens junction\ncomponents in Cdx2 mutant embryos during development. ZO-\n1\u03b1\u2013 and ZO-1\u03b1+ (encoded by Tjp1) incorporate into tight\njunctions early and late during TE formation, respectively\n(Sheth et al., 1997). E-cadherin localization to the basolateral\nadherens junctions precedes tight junction formation (reviewed\nby Fleming et al., 2000; Fleming et al., 2001). Both tight and\nadherens junctions appeared grossly normal in early\nblastocysts of both mutant and non-mutant genotype, as\nassessed by expression of ZO-1\u03b1+ (four mutants, 15 non-\nmutants; Fig. 3A,B), ZO-1\u03b1- (six mutants, 21 non-mutants; not\nshown), and E-cadherin (10 mutants, 46 non-mutants; Fig.\n3C,D). By contrast, both tight and adherens junctions appeared\nabnormal in most mutants by the late blastocyst stage. In\nparticular, ZO-1\u03b1+ appeared patchy or diffuse compared with\nlittermates (7\/8 mutants; 12 non-mutants; Fig. 3E,F), while\nZO-1\u03b1- was diffuse (3\/3 mutants, five non-mutants; not\nshown). E-cadherin expression was still observed in Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013\nblastocysts but appeared to be\nmislocalized basally in some\ncells of the TE (6\/6 mutants, 13\nnon-mutants; Fig. 3G,H). These\nobservations suggest that the\npolarity and integrity of the TE\nepithelium, while initially\nnormal, is not maintained in the\nabsence of zygotic Cdx2.\nConsistent with these\nobservations, the later polarity\nmarker integrin \u03b17 (Itga7)\n(Klaffky et al., 2001) was\nundetectable in abnormal,\ncollapsed Cdx2 mutant at 4.5\ndpc (Fig. 4E).

Culture conditions are indicated (top): non-cultured 3.5\ndpc blastocyst (Blastocyst), 1 day in KSOM (+1d KSOM), additional\n48 hours culture in presence of serum (+2d culture). Presumptive\ngenotype is indicated over each lane: wt\/het, Cdx2+\/+ or Cdx2+\/\u2013\nembryo; null, Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryo; C, control TS cell-derived RNA.\nD\nev\nel\nop\nm\nen\nt\n2098\ndifferentiation is compromised beyond the expanded blastocyst\nstage.\nCdx2 homozygous mutants fail to form trophoblast\ngiant cells or TS cell lines in vitro\nTo address whether, under in vitro culture conditions, the TE\nof Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos could be promoted to differentiate, zona-\nfree 3.5 dpc blastocysts from Cdx2+\/\u2013 intercrosses were\ncultured in serum-containing medium or specific extracellular\nmatrix substrates (Fig. 4G-I). Although Cdx2+\/\u2013 or Cdx2+\/+\nblastocysts attached and initiated TE outgrowth within 24-36\nhours after plating in serum-containing medium, Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013\nblastocysts failed to attach regardless of the extracellular\nmatrix substrate used (fibronectin, gelatin, or laminin; see\nTable 1). By 72 hours of culture, Cdx2+\/\u2013 or Cdx2+\/+ blastocysts\nformed both ICM and trophoblast outgrowths, the latter\ncontaining trophoblast giant cells with typical large nuclei and\ncytoplasm (Fig. 4G). By contrast, Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos showed no\nattachment and giant cell outgrowth, with only occasional\nparietal endoderm-like cells attached to the substrate. Embryos\nsurvived and grew into structures resembling embryoid bodies\n(Fig. 4H,I). Indeed, ES cells can be derived from Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013\nblastocysts (Chawengsaksophak et al., 2004), indicating that\nICM development is not affected in these embryos. When we\nattempted to derive TS cell lines (Tanaka et al., 1998) from\nblastocysts obtained from Cdx2+\/\u2013 intercrosses, 22 TS cell lines\nwere obtained from a total of 36 blastocysts initially cultured.\nHowever, none were Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 by genotype. Thus, Cdx2 is\nrequired for all aspects of early TE development, both diploid\nproliferation and polyploid giant cell development.\nThe pluripotency markers Oct4 and Nanog are\nectopically expressed in the putative TE of 3.5 dpc\nCdx2 mutant blastocysts\nWe examined the expression of the pluripotency-associated\ngenes Oct4 and Nanog to assess whether the outside cells of\nCdx2 mutants were correctly specified. At 3.5 dpc, Oct4 was\nexpressed in all cells of Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 blastocysts, including the outer\ncells, whereas Oct4 was restricted to the ICM in control\nembryos (3\/3 mutants, 3\/3 non-mutants; Fig. 5A,B). As Oct4\nis normally expressed in all cells prior to the blastocyst stage\nand then downregulated in outer cells, these results suggest that\nits downregulation in the TE requires expression of Cdx2.\nNanog was also expressed in the outside cells of Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013\nblastocysts (2\/2 mutants, 4 non-mutants; Fig. 5C,D). It has\npreviously been reported that Nanog is expressed only in inside\ncells of the late morula and then the ICM (Chambers et al.,\n2003; Mitsui et al., 2003). If true, this would suggest that loss\nof Cdx2 leads to ectopic activation of Nanog in outside cells.\nUsing antibody to detect Nanog protein, we found detectable\nlevels of nuclear Nanog in all cells of ~16-cell (n=13) and ~32-\ncell (n=8) Cdx2+\/+ and Cdx2+\/\u2013 embryos (Fig. 6A; not shown).\nNanog was restricted to the ICM of Cdx2+\/+ and Cdx2+\/\u2013\nembryos by the early blastocyst stage (n=10; Fig. 6C). At this\nstage, Nanog was detected at equivalent levels in TE and ICM\ncells in Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos (n=5), (Fig. 6C,D). However, no\ndifference in Nanog expression was observed between non-\nmutant and Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos (n=3) at earlier stages (Fig. 6A,B\nand not shown). These results indicate that Cdx2 is also\nrequired to ensure downregulation of Nanog, as well as Oct4,\nin outer cells beginning around the early blastocyst stage.\nIncreased incidence of programmed cell death in\nCdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos at the expanded blastocyst stage\nAs mentioned above, the periphery of the 4.5 dpc Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013\nembryos showed a rough appearance with cells delaminating\nfrom the embryonic mass surface. Moreover, nuclear staining\nrevealed fragmented, pyknotic nuclei, suggestive of cell death.\nNo such pyknotic nuclei were observed at earlier stages and\ncell numbers of mutant versus wild-type embryos were similar\n(not shown). To determine whether cell death is increased in\nCdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos, we cultured zona-free eight-cell stage\nembryos from Cdx2+\/\u2013 intercrosses, and monitored the degree\nof cell death by a TUNEL assay after 48 hours of culture (Fig.\n7). In Cdx2+\/+ or Cdx2+\/\u2013 embryos (n=16; Fig. 7A) cell death\nwas limited and almost all TUNEL-positive nuclei were within\nthe ICM (Fig. 7C). By contrast, in Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos (n=7; Fig.\n7B,B\u2032) a significantly higher number of TUNEL-positive\nnuclei was detected, with an increase of three-fold and eight-\nDevelopment 132 (9) Research article\nTable 1.

We thus conclude that\nlack of Cdx2 leads to increased cell death at the expanded\nblastocyst stage, predominantly in the outer cell layer.\nEomes is required later than Cdx2 in the trophoblast\nlineage\nEomes encodes a T-box TF and is expressed early in the\ntrophoblast lineage (Ciruna and Rossant, 1999; Russ et al.,\n2000), including the TE of the blastocyst stage (Hancock et al.,\n1999). Previous analysis of Eomes knockout embryos has\nshown that Eomes\u2013\/\u2013 embryos survive to 6.5-7.5 dpc in utero,\nbut display a blastocyst-like morphology and fail to form\ntrophoblast outgrowths in vitro (Russ et al., 2000). However,\nthe exact stage of trophoblast development affected by loss of\nEomes was not clear. We generated a targeted allele of Eomes\n(Fig. 8A) and confirmed that blastocyst-like embryos could be\nidentified in a quarter of the deciduae from Eomes+\/\u2013\nintercrosses (Fig. 8D,H). Thus, Eomes mutants, unlike Cdx2\nmutants, can induce a decidual response. To evaluate the degree\nof TE differentiation in Eomes\u2013\/\u2013 embryos we examined the\nexpression of TE-specific markers (Fig. 8). Embryos from\nEomes+\/\u2013 intercrosses were dissected at 4.5-4.75 dpc and Oct4\nand Cdx2 expression analyzed. TE-specific expression of Cdx2\nand ICM-restricted expression of Oct4 were observed in\nEomes\u2013\/\u2013 embryos (n=2), comparable with the expression\npattern in Eomes+\/+ and Eomes+\/\u2013 littermates (n=3; Fig. 8B,F).\nHowever, despite the relatively normal appearance of the\nEomes mutant blastocysts, TE differentiation at the time of\nimplantation was compromised, as measured by the expression\nof integrin \u03b17, which was undetectable in the Eomes\u2013\/\u2013\nblastocysts (two mutants, three non-mutants; Fig. 8C,G).\nTo determine whether the TE of Eomes\u2013\/\u2013 embryos can\ndifferentiate in vitro, blastocysts from Eomes+\/\u2013 intercrosses\nwere assayed for trophoblast outgrowth formation (Fig. 8E,I).\nAs previously reported (Russ et al., 2000), Eomes\u2013\/\u2013 blastocysts\nfailed to attach and form a TE outgrowth (Fig. 8I).\nMorphologically we observed that the Eomes\u2013\/\u2013 blastocysts\nremained as fully expanded blastocysts after 96 hours of\nculture, unlike Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos, which eventually collapse. We\nexamined the expression of additional TE markers by a semi-\nquantitative RT-PCR analysis from individual in vitro cultured\nblastocysts from Eomes+\/\u2013 intercrosses, as described above for\nCdx2 analysis. Analysis was performed on embryos at 24\nhours, 96 hours and 120 hours of culture (Fig. 8J). The analysis\nindicated that in the absence of Eomes, Cdx2 and Fgfr2 are still\nexpressed (Beck et al., 1995; Haffner-Krausz et al., 1999).\nHowever, the expression of Hand1 and Pl1 (Cross et al., 1995;\nFaria et al., 1991), markers of differentiated trophoblast giant\ncells, was undetectable in Eomes presumptive null embryos\n(Fig. 8J). We also attempted to derive TS cell lines from\nblastocysts obtained from Eomes+\/\u2013 intercrosses (Tanaka et al.,\n1998). Twenty-one TS cell lines were derived from a total of\n36 blastocysts initially cultured. However, none was Eomes\u2013\/\u2013\nby genotype.\nFig. 6.

The values plotted\nrepresent the mean number of TUNEL-positive nuclei (\u00b1s.e.m.). The\nincrease in the number of TUNEL positive nuclei in the ICM and TE\nin Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos compared with Cdx2+\/\u2013 or Cdx2+\/+ embryos was\nsignificant at P<0.001 using Student\u2019s t-test analysis.\nD\nev\nel\nop\nm\nen\nt\n2100\nDiscussion\nCdx2 is required for the development of a functional\ntrophectoderm\nCdx2\u2013\/\u2013 blastocysts cavitate normally, around the same time as\nnon-mutant littermates, and are initially able to expand.\nHowever, the expanded blastocoel is not maintained, embryos\nfail to hatch from the zona pellucida and mutants eventually\ncollapse into a ball of cells. Cdx2 mutants fail to implant in\nvivo or form a trophoblast giant cell outgrowth when cultured\nwithout their zona pellucida. Analysis of epithelial markers,\nsuch as tight and adherens junction components, suggests that\npolarized epithelial integrity of the outer cells is initially\nestablished, but fails to be maintained by the late blastocyst\nstage in Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 mutants, suggestive of a block in further TE\ndifferentiation and maintenance.\nExamination of markers of TE differentiation in non-\nattached mutant embryos revealed no expression of Hand1 and\nPl1, markers of trophoblast giant cells. The trophectoderm\ndifferentiation marker Pl1 can be detected in cultured wild-\ntype blastocysts, even if they do not form outgrowths (Nieder\nand Nagy, 1991). Thus, the failure of cultured Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013\nblastocysts to express Pl1 is not secondary to outgrowth failure\nbut represents a block in trophectoderm differentiation.\nExpression of the trophoblast stem cell marker, Eomes, was\nalso strongly reduced and TS cell lines could not be derived\nfrom Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos, suggesting a block in TS cell formation\nor self-renewal. As both stem cell and giant cell fate are\nblocked by absence of Cdx2, this TF must play a key role in\nearly maintenance of the integrity and function of the\nblastocyst TE.\nCdx2 is required for lineage-restricted expression of\nOct4 and Nanog\nIn Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 embryos, Oct4 and Nanog are not downregulated in\nouter cells, and persist in these cells even by 4.5 dpc. Thus, it\nappears that Cdx2 plays a primary role in specifying the fate\nof the trophectoderm cells by restricting the expression of Oct4\nand Nanog to the ICM. One explanation for the failure of TE\ndevelopment in Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 mutants could then be that the outside\ncells initiate blastocyst epithelium formation but do not\nproperly specify TE fate. Retention of pluripotency-associated\nmarkers in the outer cells might indicate transformation of\nouter cells to a more ICM-like phenotype. However, it is not\nclear whether, in the absence of Cdx2, outside cells are actually\nconverted to ICM cells. Rather, increased levels of TUNEL\nstaining in the outer cells of Cdx2 mutants suggest that the\nmisexpression of Oct4 and Nanog is incompatible with\nDevelopment 132 (9) Research article\nFig. 8.

The remaining ICM cells in 4.5 dpc Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 blastocysts\ncan continue to develop into embryoid body type structures\nwith distinct epiblast and primitive endoderm layers.\nMoreover, it is possible to generate Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 ES cells and to\nderive early somite embryos from them (Chawengsaksophak\net al., 2004).\nCdx2 expression marks TE precursors prior to\nblastocyst formation\nCdx2 expression is restricted to prospective TE cells prior to\nrestriction of Oct4\/Nanog to the ICM, consistent with a role in\ndownregulation of Oct4\/Nanog in the TE. The timing and\nexpression domains of Cdx2 and Oct4\/Nanog in normal\nembryos, and the upregulation of Oct4\/Nanog in Cdx2 mutants\nmight suggest that Cdx2 restriction to outer cells is the primary\ndriver of the divergence of ICM and TE lineages. Consistent\nwith this, Niwa et al. show that overexpression of Cdx2 is\nsufficient to drive differentiation of ES cells into trophoblast\ncells, but Cdx2 is not necessary for trophoblast differentiation\nif Oct4 is directly downregulated (H. Niwa, unpublished).\nEarly segregation of Cdx2 to the outer cells of the morula\nand early blastocyst may thus be key for initiating TE\/ICM\nspecification. Whether Cdx2 can directly regulate Oct4\/Nanog\nat the transcriptional level or acts post-transcriptionally is\ncurrently unknown. What drives the segregation of Cdx2 to the\noutside cells also remains to be determined, although the\nsimilar restricted expression pattern of Fgfr2 in the outside\ncells (Haffner-Krausz et al., 1999) and the known role for this\nsignalling pathway in promoting TE development (Chai et al.,\n1998) suggests that FGF signalling may be important upstream\nof Cdx2.\nWhy does blastocoel initiate in the absence of\nCdx2?\nAlthough Cdx2 has a pivotal role in the development of a fully\nfunctional TE and downregulation of the pluripotency-\nassociated genes, blastocoel initiation does not require zygotic\nCdx2. Nor does it seem that TE initiation can be explained by\npersistent maternal Cdx2 protein, as little or no Cdx2 protein\nwas observed in Cdx2\u2013\/\u2013 morulae and early blastocysts.\nOther factors could support the initial development of the\nTE epithelium in the absence of Cdx2. Two additional\nmembers of the Caudal-type TF family, Cdx1 and Cdx4, are\nfound in the mouse. Previous analyses indicated that the three\nCdx family members share partially overlapping expression\npatterns and functions along the embryonic axis, but only Cdx2\nis expressed in the postimplantation trophoblast, making\nredundancy with other Cdx genes unlikely (Beck et al., 1995;\nGamer and Wright, 1993; Meyer and Gruss, 1993; van den\nAkker et al., 2002).\nEomes is expressed in the TE of the blastocyst, and persists\nin the proximal region of the ExE in early post-implantation\nstages. Similarity of expression with Cdx2 might suggest\noverlapping functions. However, we show that both phenotypic\nand expression analysis place Cdx2 upstream of zygotic Eomes\nin TE development and make it unlikely that the two genes are\nacting redundantly in the initial specification of the TE\nepithelium. Unlike Cdx2 mutant embryos, Eomes\u2013\/\u2013 blastocysts\ncause a decidual reaction and show full expansion and\nmaintenance of the blastocoel in vitro, indicative of a\nfunctional TE (Russ et al., 2000) (this study). Cdx2 is\nexpressed normally and Oct4 expression is segregated to the\nICM, indicating that Eomes is not required for initial ICM\/TE\nseparation. However, neither trophoblast giant cells nor TS\ncells can develop from Eomes mutants and markers of TE\ndifferentiation are lost. This does not exclude overlapping\nfunctions for the two genes later in TS cell development, as\nmay be indicated by the failure to obtain TS cells in both cases.\nElucidation of their later roles will require timed conditional\ninactivation studies.\nIn conclusion, our studies have uncovered that Cdx2 and\nEomes are key TFs required at distinct stages during early TE\nlineage development. Eomes is required for TE differentiation\nand proliferation beyond the expanded blastocyst stage, while\nCdx2 is the earliest TE-specific TF essential for TE function\nand establishment of the trophoblast lineage, as well as for the\nlineage restricted expression of the pluripotency markers, Oct4\nand Nanog. Therefore, cell fate specification in the\npreimplantation embryo relies on positive acting TFs in both\nthe ICM and TE lineages. Elucidation of the regulatory\nmechanisms that underlie the restricted expression and\nfeedback loops between these TFs during morula stages should\nshed light on how cell fate specification is initiated in the\npreimplantation embryo.\nWe thank Drs E.
