Reidpath1*, Chantal M. Morel2, Jeffrey W. Mecaskey3, Pascale Allotey1\n1Centre for Public Health Research, Brunel University, Uxbridge, United Kingdom, 2 LSE Health, London School of Economics, London, United Kingdom, 3 Save the\nChildren UK, London, United Kingdom\nIntroduction\nThe spirit of the Millennium Declara-\ntion is to address the health and develop-\nment needs of society\u2019s most vulnerable\nand least served [1]. Issues of equity form\na key principle:\nWe recognize that, in addition to\nour separate responsibilities to our\nindividual societies, we have a col-\nlective responsibility to uphold the\nprinciples of human dignity, equality\nand equity at the global level. As\nleaders we have a duty therefore to\nall the world\u2019s people, especially the\nmost vulnerable and, in particular,\nthe children of the world, to whom\nthe future belongs [1].\nThe Declaration is operationalised\nthrough eight Millennium Development\nGoals (MDGs), each of which provides the\nblueprint and targets for addressing priori-\ntised social needs. A tension arises, how-\never, between the broad social principles\nof the Declaration, and the refined targets\nof the MDGs. Using the fourth MDG as\nan illustrative example, we highlight the\npotential to neglect equity in the race to\nachieve the set targets. MDG4 aims to\nreduce the under-five child mortality rate\n(U5MR) by two-thirds by the year 2015\n[2]. Arguments analogous to those pre-\nsented here are, however, applicable to all\nthe MDGs.\nAs a goal, in and of itself, reducing child\nmortality by two-thirds is laudable. There\nis a significant strain, however, between an\nisolated MDG4-oriented outcome, and\noutcomes that also take account of the\nbroader spirit of the Declaration. The\nproblem arises because MDG4 is present-\ned in terms of the raw, average U5MR for\na country. While this makes for simple\nreporting, the figure masks distributional\ninformation about which parts of society\ncontribute most (or least) to the magnitude\nof that rate. In other words, the measure is\nequity-blind, unable to distinguish be-\ntween a fair and an unfair social distribu-\ntion of the burden of under-five mortality\n[3,4]. As a consequence, countries can\nachieve MDG4 (an apparent success), but\nfail to address the problem of under-five\nchild mortality amongst their society\u2019s\nmost vulnerable groups (a Millennium\nDeclaration failure). Even where this\ntension has been officially recognised,\nthere has been a failure to alter the\nindicators of MDG4 success [5].\nTo illustrate some of the issues, we\npresent data on a hypothetical country\nwith a U5MR around 200\u2014that is, 200\nchild deaths per 1,000 live births per year.\nThis child mortality rate, while very high,\nis not unheard of, and was recorded in\nChad in 2004 [6], Malawi in 2000 [7], and\nBurkina Faso in 2003 [8]. From empirical\ndata we know that child mortality is not\nequally distributed across the population\nand that the wealthiest groups tend to\nexperience the lowest child mortality rates.\nThus, the average U5MR may be 200, but\nthe rate amongst the wealthiest will often\nbe a half or a quarter of that amongst the\npoorest [9].\nExploring Equity, Equality, and\nU5MR\nIf a country has unequal U5MRs across\nall the wealth groups, there is a situation of\nhealth inequality. Inequality, however,\ndoes not necessarily mean inequity (i.e.,\nunfairness). Inequality refers simply to\nvariation in the distribution of the health\noutcome within groups in the population\nThe Essay section contains opinion pieces on topics\nof broad interest to a general medical audience.\nCitation: Reidpath DD, Morel CM, Mecaskey JW, Allotey P (2009) The Millennium Development Goals Fail Poor\nChildren: The Case for Equity-Adjusted Measures.

A\ncelebrated MDG4 success can,\nthus, be a Millennium Declaration\nfailure.\nN Health policy informed by com-\nposite outcome measures that\ntake account of both the U5MR\nand the distribution of the bur-\nden of mortality across social\ngroups would help to overcome\nthis.\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 1 April 2009 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e1000062\n(or between populations) [3,10]. If a health\ninequality arises because of socially mod-\nifiable factors, then the issue is not simply\nvariation in the distribution of health\noutcomes (inequality), but one of an\nunderlying unfairness (inequity). An ob-\nservable variation in the U5MR across\nwealth groups in a society suggests a health\ninequity. Similarly, inequities may arise\nfrom social differences other than wealth,\nsuch as gender, ethnicity, or religion [5].\nAgain, for the purposes of illustration we\nfocus on wealth, but the analysis could\npotentially be applied to any of these social\nfactors as well as to the inter-relationships\nbetween them.\nFor our hypothetical country to achieve\nits MDG4 target it must, by 2015, reduce\nits child mortality rate from 200 deaths to\n66.7 deaths per 1,000 live births. For\nargument\u2019s sake let us assume that regard-\nless of wealth, all groups experience an\nidentical UM5R (i.e., equality). Table 1\nshows the U5MR for this hypothetical\ncountry today and three possible U5MR\noutcomes by 2015, assuming it achieves its\nMDG4 target. The rate is shown for each\nquintile of wealth in the population as well\nas the average rate for the population as a\nwhole. As a point of contrast the distribu-\ntion of the U5MR in Peru (1996) is shown\nin the last row of the table [11].\nA multitude of policy options exist for\nachieving an MDG4 \u2018\u2018success\u2019\u2019, and each\noption relies on underlying social choices\nthat will affect how different wealth groups\nbear the relative burden of child mortality.\nWe consider three such options. The first\npolicy option is to reduce the U5MR\nequally for each quintile of wealth in the\nhypothetical country. This maintains the\nequality of the burden of mortality across\nthe wealth quintiles. One commonly used\nmeasure of equality is the ratio of the\nmortality rate in the poorest quintile over\nthe wealthiest quintile\u2014i.e., the quintile\nratio (QR). The closer the ratio is to unity\n(QR1), the nearer the country is to\nequality of child mortality outcomes be-\ntween the richest and poorest in society. A\nsecond policy option is to ignore the\npoorest quintile entirely and focus with\ndecreasing effort on the wealthiest down to\nthe second poorest quintile. This strategy\ncan also reduce overall child mortality to\nthe MDG4 target of 66.7, but it creates an\nenormous inequality between the out-\ncomes for the wealthiest and the poorest\nin the society, with the poorest dying at a\nrate 10 times greater than the wealthiest\n(QR10). Because the inequality is a\nmanifestation of the social patterning of\nmortality related to wealth, this also\nrepresents a substantial health inequity.\nThere is no country with a quintile ratio as\nextreme as QR10, and something in the\nmiddle is more plausible (QR5). Even this\nthird option, QR5, carries a substantial\nburden for the poorest in society, but\nnonetheless achieves MDG4. Indeed, the\noutcome of the third policy option is\nremarkably close to Peru\u2019s 1996 child\nmortality rate of 68.4, with a QR of 4.98\n[11]. The outcome of each policy options\nis shown in Table 1.\nNotwithstanding the fact that QR1,\nQR5, and QR10 all achieve MDG4 and\nare thus MDG \u2018\u2018success\u2019\u2019 stories, we would\nargue that on a number of levels QR5 and\nQR10 represent significant policy failures.\nThey achieve the stated development goal,\nby leaving the most vulnerable sectors of\nsociety to bear the greatest burden of child\nmortality, clearly violating the spirit of the\nMillennium Declaration. Specifically they\nignore the second paragraph of the\nDeclaration (quoted above) and corrupt\nthe intention to \u2018\u2018spare no effort to free our\nfellow men, women and children from the\nabject and dehumanizing conditions of\nextreme poverty\u2019\u2019 [1].\nFigure 1 shows a scatter plot of child\nmortality rates against the quintile ratio\ndata reported by the World Bank for 56\nlow- and middle-income countries. These\ndata were extracted by the authors from\nWorld Bank Country Reports. Each point\nrepresents an actual country at a particular\npoint in recent time; some countries (for\nwhich there are more than a single year\u2019s\ndata) appear more than once. There is\nconsiderable diversity in both the mortal-\nity rates and the quintile ratios. The\ncolumn marked by the vertical grey band\nisolates countries with a child mortality\nrate around 67.7; i.e., these are countries\nthat have already achieved the 2015 target\nsought by our hypothetical country de-\nscribed earlier. The inequity as measured\nby the quintile ratio in U5MR outcome,\nhowever, varies between around 1 (equity\nand equality) and 5 (substantial inequity\nand substantial inequality). Although the\noverall mortality rate for these countries is\napproximately the same, it is difficult to\nargue that as policy outcomes they are\nequally successful.\nAchieving greater equity in under-five\nmortality is largely a matter of targeting\ninvestment and spreading resources to\nboost supply and demand for services\nparticularly amongst the poor and socially\nexcluded. While some countries may\nalready place a high level of importance\non health equity and mobilise resources\naccordingly, many do not. Given that the\npoorest populations tend also to be the\nhardest to reach, and hold marginal\npolitical weight, there is often little incen-\ntive for governments to prioritise their\nneeds.\nAn Equity-Adjusted Measure\nEven when it is agreed that equity is an\nimportantdimensionagainstwhich toevalu-\nate a health outcome [5], two questions\nbecome inevitable. The first question relates\nto the trade-off between (i) lowering the\nmortality rate and (ii) minimising the\ninequity. We have seen in the U5MR data\nthat improving one dimension (the U5MR\noutcome) need not improve the other (the\nequity outcome); and conversely, improving\nequity need not improve mortality (see for\ninstance [12]). If both mortality and equity\nare regarded as important policy goals, then\nto formalise the trade-off, an objective\nfunction needs to be developed that reduces\nthe two-dimensional problem to a single\ndimension, which can be maximised [13].\n\u2018\u2018There is\u2019\u2019, as one health economist noted,\n\u2018\u2018no escaping an implicit conversion [of a\nmultidimensional evaluation] to a scalar\nvalue because it is impossible to maximize\nTable 1.

Peru, with a quintile ratio of 5 in 1996, is shown as a point of contrast [11].\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.1000062.t001\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 2 April 2009 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e1000062\nmore than a single dimension at a time\u2019\u2019\n[13].Thequestion is, thus,what formshould\nthat objective function take?\nAssuming that such a function can be\nderived, for countries with identical child\nmortality rates it would identify QR1 as a\nhealthier population than QR5, which in\nturn would be identified as a healthier\npopulation than QR10. It would, in effect,\nbe an equity-adjusted measure of child\nmortality, analogous to adjusting life\nexpectancy by disability in deriving a\nsingle measure of health-adjusted life\nexpectancy.\nThe second question this raises is one of\ncost. There is a presumed efficiency\/\nequity trade-off. Even if equity is judged\nto be an important dimension against\nwhich to evaluate health outcomes, what\ncost is one prepared to bear to achieve it?\nConclusion\nThere are convincing arguments\n(amongst which we count the above) that\nin the health policy arena in particular, a\ncomposite indicator combining informa-\ntion about the distribution of U5MR as\nwell as the rate itself would contribute\nsignificantly to reorienting the global\nhealth agenda. In the absence of such\nmeasures, policy failures can be readily\ncounted as successes. The focus on the\naverage or raw rate in MDG4, without\nregard to the social distribution of the\nburden of under-five mortality, will likely\nresult in resource allocation being driven\nby expedience and lead to an increasing\ninequity. Evidence suggests that this is the\ncurrent situation [5,14].\nMidway through the target reporting\nperiod, it is critical to take stock of and\nunderstand the exact nature of the pro-\ngress being reported towards 2015. Equity\nis acknowledged as a significant issue [5],\nbut without appropriate indicators of\nachievement, it can only ever be a talking\npoint. An equity-adjusted measure of\nunder-five child mortality would not suit\nall purposes, but it could encourage better\nresource distribution and, more generally,\nbalance the desirable properties of child\nmortality reduction against the desirable\nproperties of health equity. It would also\nbetter capture the spirit of the Millennium\nDeclaration than would the equity-blind,\naverage child mortality rate described in\nMDG4. Given this analysis, it is also\nimportant to examine the extent to which\nthe other MDGs suffer from being \u2018\u2018equity\nblind\u2019\u2019.\nAuthor Contributions\nICMJE criteria for authorship read and met:\nDDR CMM JWM PA.
