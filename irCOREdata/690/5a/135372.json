Objects often carry luminance, colour, motion, depth and textural cues, each of which can serve to aid detection and localization of the object within a scene. Contemporary neuroscience presumes a modular approach to visual analysis in which each of these attributes are processed within ostensibly independent visual streams and are transmitted to geographically distinct and functionally dedicated centres in visual cortex (van Essen & Maunsell, 1983; Zihl, von Cramon & Mai, 1983; Maunsell & Newsome, 1987; Tootell, Hadjikhani, Mendola, Marrett & Dale, 1998).

Specifically, we investigate how the visual system assigns a unitary location to objects defined by multiple stimulus attributes, where such attributes provide conflicting positional cues.
