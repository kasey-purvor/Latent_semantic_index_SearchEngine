Introduction\n[2] An interesting aspect of the relationships occurring\nbetween the solar wind (SW) and the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere\nis represented by the geomagnetic response to variations of\nthe SW parameters. Indeed, the Earth\u2019s arrival of SW\ndiscontinuities characterized by sudden variations of the\ndynamic pressure (Psw), is related to impulsive variations of\nthe geomagnetic field (sudden impulses, SIs, or storm\nsudden commencements, SSCs, with similar characteristics;\nhereafter SCs). SCs are classified as sharp variations of the\nnorth\/south component (H), with rise times which typically\nrange between 1 and 9 min; their amplitude is roughly\nproportional to D(Psw\n1\/2). In addition, peak (\u2018\u2018overshoot\u2019\u2019)\nvalues often precede a new steady state, which is typically\nreferred as \u2018\u2018asymptotic response\u2019\u2019 and shows an explicit\nlongitudinal and latitudinal dependence [Siscoe et al.,\n1968; Su and Konradi, 1975; Nishida, 1978; Russell et\nal., 1992, 1994a, 1994b; Araki, 1994; Russell and Ginskey,\n1995; Francia et al., 2001; Villante and Di Giuseppe,\n2004].\n[3] On the other hand, since early investigations\n[Matsushita, 1962; Nishida and Jacobs, 1962] it is well\nknown that different transient waveforms of the H compo-\nnent are detected at different stations. According to Araki\n[1994], at auroral latitudes the H waveform typically con-\nsists of two successive pulses with opposite sense (PI and\nMI, with typical duration of \u00011\u20132 min and \u00015\u201310 min,\nrespectively). In the morning a positive pulse precedes and a\nnegative pulse follows. The sense of the pulses is reversed\nin the afternoon and their amplitude decreases with decreas-\ning latitude. The H behavior becomes more step-like at\nmiddle and low latitudes, but a two pulse structure with\nreduced amplitude is still identified. At dayside equator the\nwaveform is similar to that in the high-latitude afternoon\nsector with a preceding negative impulse (often identified as\n\u2018\u2018preliminary reverse impulse,\u2019\u2019 PRI, with a timescale of\nless than 1 min), which rarely appears at low latitudes.\nNowadays, the current understanding suggests a complex\nscenario which relates the H waveforms to the combined\neffects of the magnetopause and ionospheric current\nsystems; namely, the total disturbance field (DSC) of the\nH component can be decomposed in different subfields\n[Araki, 1977, 1994; Araki et al., 1997]:\nDSC \u00bc DL\u00fe DPPI \u00fe DPMI \u00fe PSC:\nAccording to models, the direct effect of the increased\nmagnetopause current propagates to low and middle\nlatitudes as a compressive wave and produces a step-like\nincrease of the H component (DL field, where L stands for\nlow latitudes); its amplitude is largest at the equator and\ndecreases with increasing latitude. A dusk-to-dawn electric\nfield along the compressional wave front induces a twin\nionospheric vortex system that produces a preliminary\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, A12S23, doi:10.1029\/2004JA010978, 2005\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2004JA010978$09.00\nA12S23 1 of 10\nimpulse of polar origin (DPPI). On the other hand, if the\nincreased pressure behind the SW discontinuity is kept up,\nthe magnetospheric convection has to adjust itself to the\ncompressed state of the magnetosphere: as a final result it\nproduces a twin polar vortex system (DPMI) which is\nopposite to the DPPI field and corresponds to the MI. Such\nDPMI field is basically driven by an electric field originated\nin the polar region and transmitted from the outer\nmagnetosphere through field-aligned current (FAC), which\nflow into the ionosphere in the morningside and away in the\nafternoonside. As matter of fact, DPPI and DPMI are often\nunified in a global DP field (where P identifies the polar\norigin). However, the preliminary impulse is exclusively\ndue to current systems of polar origin, DPPI, whereas\nthe main impulse is due to the combined effect of DL and\nDPMI [Sastri et al., 2001]. Last, large-amplitude pulsations\n(PSC) occasionally appear at high latitudes after the SC\noccurrence.\n[4] This basic paradigm has been successfully applied to\na number of SC events [Araki, 1994]; however, more\ncomplex SSC manifestations have been reported in several\ncases [e.g., Araki et al., 1997; Sastri et al., 2001; Moiseyev\net al., 2002]. In particular, at low latitudes (L \u0001 35\u0002),\nKikuchi and Araki [1985] found that a \u2018\u2018preliminary positive\nimpulse\u2019\u2019 (PPI, with a timescale of less than 1 min and an\naverage amplitude of \u000116 nT) often precedes the SCs\nboth at morning and afternoon hours. Of the 10 events,\n2 were associated with similar PPIs also at equatorial\nlatitudes. The morning PPIs could be a result of\nthe magnetic field decrease caused by the DP field\nsuperposed to the DL field [Tsunomura, 1998]; conversely,\nafternoon PPIs do not match with the DP current system.\nKikuchi et al. [2001] analyzed 46 low-latitude PPIs and\nshowed that afternoon PPIs occurred exclusively in the\nwinter (suggesting that ionospheric conductivity plays an\nimportant role), while there was no significant seasonal\ndependence for morning PPIs. They also presented a case\nstudy in which the low-latitude PPI was associated\nwith PRI near dip equator. After subtracting the expected\nDL, they proposed that the low-latitude PPI consisted of\na \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019 PPI and a succeeding negative impulse and\ninterpreted the experimental observations in terms of a\nmajor role of the FAC in the magnetic field perturbations\nat low latitudes.\n[5] A series of remarkable interplanetary events in\nApril 2002 drew the attention of the space weather\ncommunity and promoted integrated descriptions of the\ncomplex behavior of the coupled Sun-Earth system. With\nthe present paper we intend to contribute to this joint\nscientific effort providing a detailed analysis of the high-\nresolution measurements (1 s) performed at three stations of\nour low-latitude geomagnetic array, SEGMA (AQU,\ncorrected geomagnetic latitude L = 36.3\u0002; RNC, L =\n38.2\u0002; NCK, L = 42.7\u0002; MLT \u0001 UT + 1.30, MLT being\nthe magnetic local time [Vellante et al., 2002]) during the\nSC event occurred on 17 April 2002. We restricted our\nanalysis to a small area in the noon quadrant focusing\nattention on the significant differences which appear at\nnearby stations during a \u000140 min interval characterized\nby a compression of the Earth magnetosphere and north-\nward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. For\nthis scope we compared SEGMA observations with those\nobtained at SAMNET, IMAGE, and BGS stations (5 s), as\nwell as with low-resolution measurements (1 min) at two\nequatorial stations, approximately in the same quadrant.\n[6] The present analysis provides several interesting\nresults. In particular, it reveals a significant contribution at\nlow latitudes of the polar current system: it plays a different\nrole for events with \u2018\u2018morning\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018afternoon\u2019\u2019 character-\nistics, respectively, and explicitly determines their asymp-\ntotic response. We also identified additional aspects, which,\nFigure 1.

Experimental Results\n2.1. General Aspects of the Geomagnetic Response\n[7] As shown in Figure 1, an interplanetary shock was\ndetected by Wind (XSE \u0001 12.8 RE, YSE \u0001 200.8 RE) on\n17 April 2002 at \u00011100 UT. The SW velocity, in less than\n3 min, varied from \u0001330 to \u0001450 km\/s (with peak values of\n\u0001520 km\/s), the density varied from \u000120 to \u000170 cm\u00043 and\npersisted high for approximately 2 hours; as a consequence,\nthe dynamic pressure varied from \u00014 to \u000123 nPa (with\npeak values of \u000128 nPa). The IMF increased from \u00018 to\n\u000126 nT; its orientation turned northward after the\nshock front and maintained this orientation up to\n\u00011150 UT. At geostationary orbit, in the dawn sector\n(where the magnetospheric response is much less explicit\nthan in the noon quadrant [Kokubun, 1983; Kuwashima and\nFukunishi, 1985; Sastri et al., 2001]), Goes 8 detected an\nirregular SC variation, mostly on the Bx, sm component, at\n\u00011107\u20131110 UT (\u00010602\u20130605 MLT).\n[8] Geomagnetic field measurements at low latitudes in\nthe subsolar quadrant (AQU, 1 min averages in Figure 1)\nshow, on the H component, an SC signature characterized\nby a double step increase (with a rise time of \u00013\u20134 min,\n1106\u20131110 UT), followed by a long-term decrease to a new\nsteady state. As can be seen, the comparison with simple\nmodel predictions reveals that the variation of the\nH component is remarkably larger than expected for the\nDL contribution alone [Tsyganenko, 1995, 1996, 2002a,\n2002b]. Nevertheless, its peak variation (\u000110.6 nT\/(nPa)1\/2)\nis smaller than usually estimated (13\u201314 nT\/(nPa)1\/2 [Siscoe\net al., 1968; Su and Konradi, 1975; Nishida, 1978]). On the\nother hand, from the temporal variation of Psw we would\nexpect a more prominent step-like change. The D compo-\nnent shows an explicit decrease, which is indicative of a\nlong-lasting DP contribution [Tsunomura, 1998]. It\nis interesting to remark that this contribution is still\nsignificant at TAM (L = 11.4\u0002, MLT = UT + 0.56),\nwhile equatorial measurements (ASC, L = 2.1\u0002, MLT =\nUT \u0004 0.37) do not show significant D variation.\nMoreover, at TAM, the H variation is steeper, and mostly\nresembles the Psw behavior.\n2.2. High-Resolution Measurements\n[9] When examined on higher timescale (1 s), AQU\nmeasurements reveal a composite SC structure. Indeed, in\nthe H component a negative variation (N) is superimposed\nto the main positive variation (P) soon after its onset\n(Figure 2a). Consequently, the H behavior is characterized\nby a preceding signal (with a peak value, H2, at\n1107:20 UT), a main positive variation (H4, 1110:50 UT),\nand then a long-term decrease. As a matter of fact, this\nbehavior basically reflects that one proposed, at higher\nlatitudes, by model predictions in the morning sector, with\na positive then negative variation (P\/N) preceding the main\nvariation [Araki, 1994]. On the other hand, according to the\ncriteria proposed by Kikuchi and Araki [1985], the preced-\ning H structure may be identified as a PPI: it has a global\nduration of \u000170 s, and peak amplitude of \u000134 nT (i.e.,\nlarger than usually observed). It is also interesting to remark\nthat, as for other events [Kikuchi et al., 2001], the low-\nlatitude PPI is anticipated by a small amplitude and a rapid\ndecrease (H1). Several fluctuations are superimposed to the\nbasic pattern and suggest a complex PPI structure. This\nFigure 2. One-second measurements of the geomagnetic field components at AQU.\nA12S23 VILLANTE ET AL.: SC OF 17 APRIL 2002\n3 of 10\nA12S23\nfeature is confirmed by the D component (Figure 2b), which\nexhibits an earlier N\/P structure (D1, D2) with different\nduration times (\u000120 s).\n[10] Figure 3 shows the 5 s measurements at different\nstations, as organized in narrow (8\u201317 min) MLT sectors in\nthe subsolar region. SEGMA stations are located in the B\nsector: here the experimental observations, for the H com-\nponent (Figure 3a), confirm the \u2018\u2018morning\u2019\u2019 pattern (i.e.,\nwith a PPI preceding the main variation) at least up to L \u0001\n43\u0002 (NCK). Conversely, the H trace at KVI (L \u0001 56\u0002,\nC sector) might be better considered already indicative of a\nPRI preceding the main variation. At higher latitudes (NOR,\nL \u0001 61\u0002) the irregular trace does not allow an unambiguous\nidentification of the characteristics of the preliminary\nFigure 3.

(a) H component; (b) D component.\nA12S23 VILLANTE ET AL.: SC OF 17 APRIL 2002\n4 of 10\nA12S23\nevents. Approximately the same pattern detected at\nKVI, more explicit emerges at NUR (L \u0001 57\u0002) and HAN\n(L \u0001 59\u0002) in the D sector; a more complex structure appears\nat KIL (L \u0001 66\u0002), where the negative variation is antici-\npated by a positive impulse of smaller amplitude. In\nagreement with the global scenario, in the earliest sector\n(A), the basic pattern appears consistent with P\/N variation\nexpected in the morning sector at least up to GML (L \u0001\n55\u0002); while at higher latitudes the H trace (still indicative of\na preceding positive variation) becomes more irregular.\nUnfortunately, high-resolution measurements are not avail-\nable at equatorial latitudes: so we cannot identify the\nFigure 4.

Moreover, in the subauroral region, in the D sector,\nits trace is characterized by large-amplitude fluctuations,\nwhich appear at the SC occurrence and persist for several\ncycles. These fluctuations are much less evident in other\nMLT sectors and at higher latitudes (as confirmed by visual\nFigure 5. A comparison between 1 s measurements at SEGMA stations: (a) H component, (b) D\ncomponent. (c) The power spectra of the H component at SEGMA stations (1105\u20131109 UT) compared\nwith the power spectra of the Bp component of the magnetospheric field (i.e., parallel to the Earth\u2019s\nrotation axis). The power spectra have been evaluated on differentiated data by means of the maximum\nentropy method.\nA12S23 VILLANTE ET AL.: SC OF 17 APRIL 2002\n6 of 10\nA12S23\ninspection of data from other stations). A joint analysis of H\nand D measurements revealed almost regular fluctuations,\nwith an approximate period T \u0001 150\u2013160 s, and polariza-\ntion axis at large angles with respect to H: this features\nconflicts with the resonance phenomena (often invoked to\ninterpret the occurrence of similar events [Araki, 1994;\nPetrinec et al., 1996]) which would rather predict a polar-\nization axis basically along H.\n[12] The results of Figure 3 also suggest the nonsimulta-\nneous occurrence of PPIs and PRIs in different sectors and\nreveal that the negative variation (DH) following PPIs\nbecomes progressively deeper and longer with increasing\nlatitude. These aspects are made clear in Figure 4, which\nreveals that \u2018\u2018afternoon\u2019\u2019 PRIs occur approximately 0\u201310 s\nbefore \u2018\u2018morning\u2019\u2019 PPIs. They are preceded by the DD\nstructures, which at higher latitudes appear later than at\nlower latitudes. Moreover, the absolute amplitude of PRIs,\nDHs, and DDs explicitly increases with latitude (note that\nDH and DD show the same latitudinal variation), a feature\nthat clearly reveals their high-latitude origin. In particular,\ntheir latitudinal trends would lead to predict vanishing\namplitude of PRIs at \u000152\u0002 and at \u000132\u0002 for DHs and\nDDs. Conversely, the PPI amplitude reveals only a small\nincrease between low and subauroral latitudes.\n2.3. An Analysis of PPI Structure at Low Latitudes\n[13] Kikuchi et al. [2001] investigated the PPI structure\nassuming that the step-like variation of the H component at\nvery low latitudes (\u000114\u0002) was entirely caused by the DL\nfield, and subtracting this signal from low-latitude measure-\nments. The results of Figure 1 show that this technique\ncannot be used in the present case: indeed, the experimental\nobservations are clearly indicative of a significant DP\ncontribution at \u000111\u0002.\n[14] However, an analysis of 1 s measurements at SEGMA\nstations reveals interesting aspects. Figures 5a and 5b show a\nsuperposition of geomagnetic field traces. As can be seen, at\nAQU and RNC the field traces closely follow each other.\nConversely, significant modifications appear in the NCK\ntrace. In particular, the initial superimposed fluctuations do\nnot appear in phase with AQU\/RNC traces; at NCK they\ndepress H below pre-SC values and determine a peak to peak\nexcursion (\u000147.2 nT) appreciably larger than at AQU\n(\u000134.7 nT). In addition, the results of Figure 5a show at\nNCK a more pronounced enhancement associated with the\nmain variation.\n[15] The different aspects of AQU\/RNC and NCK obser-\nvations are confirmed by the power spectra of differentiated\nH measurements as evaluated by means of the maximum\nentropy method. Figure 5c reveals that the PPI basically\nconsists of different signals at well-defined frequencies. In\nparticular, at AQU and RNC, it consists of common peaks\nin the H component (with different relative importance), at\n\u000112 mHz, \u000138 mHz, \u000159 mHz, and a less pronounced\npower enhancement at \u000187 mHz; conversely, at NCK,\npower peaks appear at \u000117 mHz, \u000132 mHz, \u000156 mHz,\n\u000171 mHz. Power spectra of the D component (not shown)\nreveal a less clear situation with much lower energy content.\nAs shown in Figure 5c, broad power enhancements\n(\u000115 mHz, \u000133 mHz, \u000140 mHz, \u000159 mHz, \u000186 mHz)\nare observed also in the dawn sector in the BP component of\nthe magnetospheric field (i.e., parallel to Earth\u2019s rotation\naxis). The different results detected in ground observations\nmight be tentatively interpreted in terms of cavity-like\noscillations [Yumoto, 1994], which couple with local field\nline resonance. In particular, the more prominent peak\n(\u000159 mHz) at lower-latitude stations is close to the expected\nlocal resonant frequency (\u000160 mHz); at the same time the\nlocal resonance at NCK (\u000130 mHz) may well interpret the\npeak at \u000132 mHz.\n2.4. Asymptotic Response\n[16] The asymptotic response has been usually deter-\nmined comparing pre-SC averages of the H component\nwith those evaluated \u000110 to 15 min after the peak values\n[Russell et al., 1992, 1994a, 1994b; Russell and Ginskey,\n1995; Francia et al., 2001; Villante and Di Giuseppe,\n2004]. Accordingly, in Figure 6a we show the results\nobtained by a simple difference, DHAS, between 10 min\naverages of the H component \u000120 min after the peak\nresponse (1130\u20131140 UT) and those obtained before\nthe SC manifestation (1055\u20131105 UT). It is clear the\nappearance of two regimes with different DHAS (for compa-\nrable latitudes) and latitudinal trend. More particularly,\n\u2018\u2018morning\u2019\u2019 events (i.e., associated with P\/N structure) show\na gentle latitudinal decrease, with a coefficient k =\u00041.2 nT\/\u0002\n(the transition between positive and negative DHAS occurs at\n\u000152\u0002). Conversely, \u2018\u2018afternoon\u2019\u2019 events (i.e., for H traces\nconsistent with N\/P structures) are clearly characterized by\nlarge negative DHAS (up to \u000170 nT at \u000161.5\u0002), together\nwith a much steeper latitudinal decrease (k =\u00047.0 nT\/\u0002). The\nD component also shows negative values (with an average\nvalue of \u0001\u000414 \u00b1 8 nT); however, it does not reveal any\nexplicit latitudinal dependence (Figure 6b).\n[17] In order to evaluate the whole asymptotic response,\nfollowing Villante and Di Giuseppe [2004], we identified\nthe direction (M1, positive for a northward and eastward\norientation) of maximum variation of the global field. For\nthis scope we evaluated, at steps of 1\u0002, the total variation\n(DBAS) of the geomagnetic field between 10 min averages\nbefore and after the SC occurrence. Figure 6c shows the\nresults obtained for the DBAS projection along M1: in this\ncase the gentler gradient corresponds to k = \u00041.8 nT\/\u0002,\nwhile the steeper gradient corresponds to k = \u00046.6 nT\/\u0002. As\na matter of fact, if a horizontal current layer in the\nionosphere generated the global field variations, the orien-\ntation of the equivalent current system could be inferred by\na 90\u0002 rotation of M1. As can be seen (Figure 6d), the\nemerging pattern reveals significant local deviations with\nrespect to models and usual observations, in particular at\nlower latitudes, where current lines would be expected close\nto geomagnetic parallels [Nishida, 1968; Araki, 1994].\nMore particularly, the M1 axis shows approximately the\nsame orientation at L \u0001 36\u0002 and L \u0001 38\u0002 (namely, QAQU \u0001\n48\u0002, QRNC \u0001 49\u0002, Q being the angle between M1 and H),\nwhile it is oriented at larger Q between L \u0001 43\u0002 and 51\u0002\n(QNCK \u0001 77\u0002, QHAD \u0001 74\u0002, QYOR \u0001 67\u0002): it suggests a\nsignificant modification of the current system at \u000140\u0002 in the\nsubsolar sector.\n3. Summary and Discussion\n[18] In the present paper we investigated the complex\nmanifestation of a SC event focusing attention on the different\nA12S23 VILLANTE ET AL.: SC OF 17 APRIL 2002\n7 of 10\nA12S23\naspects which emerge at low latitude in a\u00012 hour interval in\nthe subsolar sector. Main differences between nearby stations\ninclude the SSC structure, the asymptotic response, and the\nappearance of large-amplitude fluctuations.\n[19] 1. The morphological differences in the SC manifes-\ntation suggest a boundary between P\/N and N\/P structures\nclose to the 1300 MLT meridian. Above \u000160\u0002 the SC\nmanifestation becomes more irregular. Within the limits of\nthe present investigation, this pattern can be considered\nconsistent with the usual scenario detected at higher\nlatitudes [Araki, 1994], where in the morning a positive\npulse precedes and a negative pulse follows (with a conse-\nquent PPI) and the sense of the pulse is reversed in the\nafternoon (with a consequent PRI). This pattern is currently\ninterpreted in terms of a superposition of the low-latitude\nDL field and the high-latitude DP field. Its extension to low\nlatitudes is clearly supported in the present case by the clear\nmanifestation of the DP field up to L \u0001 10\u0002 and by the\nlatitudinal variation of PRIs and DHs (and DDs). However,\nthe clear tendency for higher-latitude PRIs to precede lower-\nlatitude PPIs, as well as the negligible latitudinal depen-\ndence of the PPI amplitude are important elements that\nshould be considered for a better representation of the SC\nmanifestation. The afternoon current system, moreover, in\nthe subauroral region reveals large-amplitude fluctuations\n(rapidly decreasing with decreasing latitude), which cannot\nFigure 6.

Conversely, resonant\nphenomena may interpret the small-scale differences which\nemerge at low latitudes, where the PPI structure consists of\nthree almost monochromatic signals with different relative\namplitude.\n[20] 2. Kikuchi et al. [2001] interpreted the seasonal\ndependence of the PPI\/PRI occurrence during the day,\nsuggesting the FAC effects overcome the ionospheric\neffects in winter while the opposite situation should occur\nin summer. As a consequence, PPIs should be observed in\nwinter at afternoon midlatitudes, and PRIs should be\nobserved in summer around noon and in the afternoon. As\npreviously remarked, the present observations (and the lack\nof high-resolution measurements at equatorial latitudes) do\nnot provide elements for a composite scenario: however,\nit is worth noting that FAC and ionospheric currents should\napproximately compensate at low latitudes around\nnoon during spring months: then any prediction of possible\nPPI\/PRI manifestations might be questionable. On the other\nhand, the D component reveals negative asymptotic varia-\ntions at each station. In this sense it is interesting to remark\nthat Tsunomura [1988], who evaluated the FAC effects on\nthe ground variations, proposed for a spring event\nan explicit negative variation of the D component in a\nwide sector centered around noon from low to subauroral\nlatitudes.\n[21] 3. The asymptotic response of the H component\nis characterized by positive and negative values below\nand above L \u0001 52\u0002. Moreover, it is strongly influenced\nby the shape of the SC manifestation (N\/P or P\/N),\nand, for comparable latitudes, structures characterized by\na N\/P variation are associated with much larger nega-\ntive variations. It suggests a significant long-lasting\ncontribution, which remarkably depresses the high-\nlatitude H component in the afternoonside. This is an\nimportant aspect, which should be taken into account\nbefore comparing results obtained for the different\nevents and inferring the MLT and latitudinal dependence\nof the asymptotic response [Siscoe et al., 1968; Su and\nKonradi, 1975; Nishida, 1978; Russell et al., 1992, 1994a,\n1994b; Araki, 1994; Russell and Ginskey, 1995; Francia et\nal., 2001; Villante and Di Giuseppe, 2004]. In particular,\nprevious statistical analysis proposed strongly depressed\nvalues of the H component in the morning (0600\u20131000\nMLT) and peak values in the afternoon (1400\u20131600 MLT)\nfrom low to subauroral latitudes [Francia et al., 1999,\n2001; Russell and Ginskey, 1995]. Our results suggest\nfor the present case a region of depressed (and even\nnegative) field values which extends at least to the noon\nquadrant.\n[22] Acknowledgments.
