The material culture evidence is used to investigate the probable \nconnections linking the communities exploiting this landscape with those in other parts of the \nLevant, including those occupying the marl landscape on the east side of the Orontes River. A \nconsideration of contemporary activity in the Hauran, Jaulan and Negev, sets activity in the \nHoms basalts in the context of a region-wide increase in the exploitation of \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 \nlandscapes, which lay beyond the prime agricultural areas. \n \nKeywords:  \n1. Introduction: themes and context [A] \n \n[B] The project \nSettlement and Landscape Development in the Homs Region, Syria (SHR) is a \nmultidisciplinary, multi-period regional survey project that is run jointly between the \nUniversity of Durham and the Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM). It \nseeks to understand settlement organization in a sample area of western Syria over a long \ntime-span, and across varied environments. Work has focused upon two study areas (Fig. 1). \nThe Southern Study Area (SSA) covers around 400 km\n2\n mostly composed of lacustrine marls. \nThe Northern Study Area (NSA) extends to approximately 120 km\n2\n and consists of an area of \nbasaltic upland to the west of the river, and a stretch of marl terrain east of the Orontes (see \nPhilip et al. 2002, 3\u20136). While aspects of settlement in the marl landscape during the Bronze \nand Iron Ages have been discussed elsewhere (Philip et al. 2005, Philip 2007), the present \narticle presents for the first time a systematic account of pre-classical activity in the basaltic \nregion of the NSA. For the sake of brevity, the term NSA when used in this account without \nfurther qualification refers only to the basalt landscape west of the Orontes River.  \nA. Research context [B] \nIn a previous article (Philip et al. 2005, 30) we noted that the datasets currently available \ncontain significant incompatibilities between the archaeological record as currently \ndocumented in the \u2018upland\u2019 and \u2018lowland\u2019 landscapes of the Middle East. This has \nconstrained efforts to gain a coherent understanding of the long-term development of human \nactivity across different landscape categories (Banning 1996; Wilkinson et al. 2004, 202\u20134). \nIn practice, as generally used, the terms \u2018upland\u2019 and \u2018lowland\u2019 do not refer strictly to \naltitude. Rather, \u2018upland\u2019 landscapes are generally rockier, and are those wherein stone is the \nprime building material. \u2018Lowland\u2019 landscapes are generally those where mud brick is \npreferred, generally the river basins and rolling plains of Mesopotamia and the Levant. When \nthe terms are used in this sense, the marl and basalt landscapes described above constitute \ngood examples of \u2018lowland\u2019 and \u2018upland\u2019 landscapes respectively.  \nTraditional extensive survey methods have proved quite effective in locating the nucleated \ntell sites which characterize much settlement of the Bronze and Iron Ages in \u2018lowland\u2019 \nregions. However, they have been rather less successful in recognizing the smaller, dispersed \nsettlements that mark the presence of later occupation. In contrast, research on \u2018upland\u2019 areas \nhas focused on settlements of Graeco-Roman date, which are frequently characterized by \nstanding stone architecture (e.g. Tchalenko 1953\u201358; Tate 1992). Evidence for activity in \nearlier periods has often proven elusive in these areas, and it is not always clear whether this \nreflects a genuine absence of pre-classical activity in these landscapes, or results from a \nscholarly focus upon settlements characterized by large-scale architectural remains of the \nkind generally characteristic of the classical world.  \nThe first interpretation finds support in recent survey work in the Amanus Mountains and the \nJebel el-Aqra regions located to the west and south of the Amuq Plain respectively. As in the \ncase of SHR, these surveys, made extensive use of satellite imagery as a prospection tool, but \nhave \u2018produced little evidence for occupation post-dating the Neolithic and predating the \nHellenistic period\u2019 (Casana 2004, 110), a view that has been modified only very slightly in \nmore recent statements (Casana 2007, 199, 204). That said, it is not clear how this view \nrelates to reports of stone-built megalithic structures in these areas (e.g. Y\u00fckmen 2000; 2003). \nWhile the latter are often hard to date with certainty, they are most likely to relate to activity \nfalling within Casana\u2019s posited post-Neolithic, pre-Hellenistic \u2018gap\u2019. Moreover, the presence \nof both Graeco-Roman and earlier activity in the Hauran is suggestive (e.g. Dentzer 1985; \nBraemer 1984; 1988; 1993).  \nAn additional pointer might be taken from parts of the southern Levant such as the basaltic \nuplands of the Jaulan and the arid-zone of the Negev, which have been surveyed rather more \nintensively than has most of Syria. While these regions cannot really be considered as prime \nagricultural zones, work there is generating an ever-growing corpus of evidence for activity \nin the Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages (Avner and Carmi 2001; Epstein; 1985, 1998; \nMizrachi et al. 1996; Rosen 2008), much of which does not take the form of traditional tell \nsites.  \nIn line with these developments, initial work in the Homs basalts identified a range of site \nmorphologies, at least some of which were suspected as being of pre-classical date (Philip et \nal. 2005, 36\u201337), and thus supporting evidence for the second of these interpretations. The \nrange of dating evidence obtained during this initial phase of fieldwork was limited. \nHowever, as a result of fieldwork undertaken between 2007 and 2009 in the basaltic area of \nthe NSA, our project is now able to contribute to a discussion of the nature of pre-classical \nactivity in what we have termed \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 zones. While admittedly an inelegant term, we \nfind it useful for application to regions that, while by no means constituting prime \nagricultural land, offer a rather broader range of economic possibilities than the so-called \nmarginal landscapes such as the arid steppe edge territories, which are situated between the \nfertile zone and the Arabian desert (Geyer 2001; Jaubert and Geyer 2006). In short, \u2018sub-\noptimal\u2019 regions may offer considerable economic potential, but there are often factors that \ntend to hinder its realization. As a result, the intensity with which these landscapes were used, \nand thus the nature of their relationships with \u2018core\u2019 areas, differed markedly over time, with \nthe periods of most marked development generally resulting from quite specific \ncircumstances.  \nB. Key aims [B] \nWe seek below to present new evidence regarding the nature, dating, and distribution of pre-\nclassical structures identified through survey, and to view these in relation to both other \naspects of the archaeology, and to natural landscape affordances. These will be placed in a \nwider context through a consideration of patterns of association, facilitating a discussion of \nthe nature of activity in those landscapes in which tell sites are sparse. In doing so, we hope \nto highlight the importance of these areas for our understanding of wider political and \neconomic developments.  \nThe presentation is of interest from several perspectives. [list style] \n1. Prior to recent land clearance strategies, this area represented what Wilkinson (2003, \n41\u201342) terms a landscape of survival. However, the local archaeological record is now \nbeing rapidly destroyed by bulldozing, as part of a de-rocking programme that has \neliminated around 60% of the archaeological structures that could be identified using \n1960s Corona satellite imagery. The aim of this process is to remove surface rock \ncover by bulldozing, to create large, stone-free rectilinear fields that are suitable for \nmore intensive agriculture. For an explanation of this method of land reclamation in \nSyria and its anticipated economic benefits see IFAD 2010. A description of the \narchaeological record in these areas, will underscore its unobtrusive character, \nespecially in comparison with large tell sites, or the standing architecture of the \nGraceo-Roman period. It will also highlight the difficulty of locating sites without \naccess to aerial photographs or satellite imagery, and thus the ease with such evidence \ncan be omitted from conventional archaeological inventories. When these two points \nare combined it becomes clear why we believe that this particular part of the regional \narchaeological record is that which is at most serious risk of wholesale destruction.  \n 2. It will provide an indication of the kind of material that appears to be associated with \nlater prehistoric and Early Bronze Age activity in regions where evidence for these \nperiods is poorly known. It will thus provide a starting point for the re-examination of \nthe evidence from other parts of the Middle East, and thus for a fuller assessment of \nthe nature and distribution of past populations. \n \n3. It will allow us to characterize a set of human-landscape relationships, and an \nassociated material culture assemblage, that appears to have differed in significant \nways from those of the better-documented tell landscapes.  \n \n4. By clarifying the extent and temporality of activity in hitherto under-emphasized \nregions, we will be required to reconsider aspects of our current understanding of \nhuman activity on a regional scale, and thus to view the development of settlement \nlandscapes characterized by the familiar tell sites, as but one part of a wider dynamic. \n[end list] \n2. The Homs basalt: landscape and traditional agriculture [A] \n \nIn geological terms, the area under study forms part of the Homs basalts which are dated \nbetween 6.5 and 2.0 million years ago (Chorowicz et al. 2005, 261). The part of this \nformation which lies with the NSA (Figs 1 and 2, basalt located west of the Orontes River), \nconsists of a series of low ridges, valleys, and depressions which range in elevation between \n400 and 600 m above sea level. The area receives an average annual precipitation in the range \n400\u2013600 mm, with rainfall concentrated between the months of November and April. During \nthe dry season, which lasts from May to October, the landscape can appear barren and \nforbidding (Fish and Dubertret 1945\u201348, 120, fig. 3; Na\u2018aman 1951, 25\u201326; Wolfart 1967, \nfig. 10), a point reflected in its popular name\u2014the wa\u2018ar. Unlike the arid steppe zone, \nhowever, the Homs basalt receives sufficient precipitation to support reliable rain-fed \nagriculture, and the region is dissected by several seasonal wadis, which flow from the \nbeginning of the rains until as late as June (Na\u2018aman 1951, 25). It also features a large \nnumber of small seasonal pools and a few larger internal depressions, which capture both \nrainfall and underground flows, and can retain water well into spring. However, water \nscarcity during the summer is a problem, with recent populations using cisterns, stone-lined \npools (birqat) and natural basins, to retain water (Wirth 1971, 252\u201354).  \nAs the NSA, represents only a sample area of a larger landscape, it is important to understand \nthat traditionally the larger villages in the region, such as Tell Daou, Kafr Laha and Tell \nZahab, all of which were situated atop ancient tells, were concentrated in a lowland basin \nknown as the Houleh (Na\u2018aman 1951, 55). The latter is fed by a number of east-flowing \nwadis which drain the eastern slopes of the volcanic Jebel Hilou (Fig. 2A), and pass through \nthe Houleh en-route to join the Wadi Harb Nasfe (Fig. 2E), and ultimately the Orontes. While \nthe centre of the Houleh is located over 5 km to the north-west of, and thus outside, the NSA, \nthe concentration of soil, water and settlement in this region is likely to have a bearing on our \noverall understanding of the wa\u2018ar.  \nThe more upland parts of the NSA might best be viewed as an area of relatively low \npopulation density, located between more heavily settled areas, namely the Orontes Valley to \neast and the Houleh to the north-west. However, a second focus of settlement was located in \nthe region of the villages of Ghour al-Gharbiyah and Tlil (Fig. 2) where there exists a smaller \nlowland basin which Na\u2018aman (1951, 30\u201331) viewed as a southern extension of the Houleh. \nThis small lowland basin lies at the end of the Wadi al-Qasab, one of the main wadi systems \nrunning through the NSA, and the importance of which is discussed below. Both of these \nbasins are partially inundated in winter, and thus of limited value for winter cultivation, \nalthough the alluvial fills (which are not typical of all valley bottom areas in the wa\u2018ar) were \nused for the cultivation of summer crops such as sorghum in recent centuries. \nWithin the NSA, there are two main drainage systems both of which trend south-west to \nnorth-east. The first and most important in terms of settlement is the Wadi al-Qasab (Fig. \n2D), which runs in a long broad valley extending eastwards from the Ghour\u2013Tlil basin, \nrunning close to the village of Samalil (SHR 860), before tuning northwards where it passes \nclose to SHR 49. Beyond this point the wadi turns eastwards to run through a narrow valley, \npassing several abandoned settlements of Roman through Islamic date, before finally turning \nnorth and widening out as it leaves the NSA to join the Wadi Nafsi, a tributary of the Orontes \nwhich now flows into the south side of the Rastan Lake.  \nThe second is much shorter, and drains eastwards towards the Orontes in a relatively \nuninterrupted fashion (Fig. 2F). There are only two significant settlements along its 6 km \nlength, the village of Refayn which is located close to the start of the stream, and a small tell \n(SHR 81) located at the point where the stream enters the Orontes Valley proper. The large \nnumber of ancient settlements located along the Wadi al-Qasab, and the presence of check-\ndams along its course observed during fieldwork in 2009, suggests that it carried a reliable \nseasonal flow and offered better valley-bottom lands for agricultural purposes. Moreover, \nwhilst early 20th century maps of the region highlight the importance of the Houleh basin and \nOrontes Valley as occupational foci in recent centuries, the evidence for Chalcolithic-Early \nBronze Age (Chalco-EB) activity along this wadi course suggests a rather different, perhaps \nmore multi-focal, distribution of population in the more distant past. \nWithin the NSA itself, the terrain includes rocky ridges and outcrops with little soil, but also \npatches of cultivable lands along valley bottoms, and depressions which may retain water or \nsupport marsh vegetation depending on the season (Na\u2018aman 1951, 19\u201321). The presence of \nnumerous fissures within the rock has increased the permeability of the basalt (Weulersse \n1940, 31), although the high clay content of the soil hinders drainage during the winter \nmonths. The resulting accumulation of water in planted furrows can impede the development \nof vegetation, while the presence of sticky, wet clay hinders movement across the landscape \n(Na\u2018aman 1951, 24). Conversely, during the dry season the soils can form a crust and thus \nrestrict plants from gaining moisture (ibid.). Even allowing for the possibilities presented by \nsoils and precipitation, the high concentration of stone scattered across the surface of the soil, \nthis the result of the decomposition of the original basalt pavement, is such that a significant \nlabour input would have been required to create productive agricultural land. Moreover, the \nrocky and dissected nature of the terrain hinders communications, both internally and with \nother regions. As a result, while the Homs basalt should not be classed as a \u2018marginal\u2019 area, it \nfits the definition given above for a \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 landscape, in that it has genuine potential \nas an agricultural resource, but considerable effort is required if this is to be realized. Despite \nthese potential limitations this landscape has clearly been utilized over many thousands of \nyears, although its name, the wa\u2018ar, captures the difficulty that it presents to human \npopulations. \nThe basalt landscape presents a range of territories, each with markedly different potential. \nFor example, Na\u2018aman (1951, 40) observes that in the earlier 20th century, the relative \nproportion of the key cereal crops grown in the region (wheat, barley and sorghum) varied \nsignificantly between villages, according to localized differences in topography and soil \nmoisture retention. In the absence of sorghum, which did not appear in Syria until well after \nthe Bronze Age (Zohary and Hopf 2000, 88\u201390), the potential of this landscape as a summer \nresource would have been considerably reduced, with agriculture presumably focused on the \nwinter crops such as wheat and barley, with barley perhaps favoured on the less attractive \nsoils, and the basin perhaps used to provide fodder crops over the summer.  \nIn terms of livestock raising Na\u2018aman (1951, 46\u201348) observes that in pre-modern times, \nanimals were raised exclusively on pasture from March through May when the landscape is \ngreen, and that in the 19th and early 20th centuries AD local communities would take \nadditional animals from areas to the east in years when grazing was particularly abundant. \nHowever, while caprines could live on the available pasture, the local sheep were generally \nsmall and thin, and levels of milk production per animal were low compared to some other \nparts of Syria. Cattle required fodder in winter, and this was obtained from grasses growing \nin the fallow areas and could be stored in walled enclosures. It is worth noting that the \npopulation often had to depend upon wild plant foods from February onwards as the harvest \nstockpile was exhausted (Na\u2018aman 1951, 54). \n3. The Archaeology of the Homs basalt [A]  \nThe basalt region west of Homs, represents a palimpsest of archaeological activity dating \nfrom the Neolithic to the 18th\u201319th centuries AD (Philip et al. 2002; Philip et al. 2005). This \nhas been untangled through a combination of image analysis and fieldwork, with more than \n200 sites identified within the NSA since 2002. One of the most striking facets of this data is \nthe sheer range of forms existing in the area, and we are now in a position to outline the \nnature, and offer an interpretation of the archaeological evidence for pre-classical activity in \nthe region. As Graeco-Roman material is so conspicuous, however, it makes sense to discuss \nthis briefly, before turning to those elements that we believe to be rather earlier. \nThe discussion of sites presented below supersedes the preliminary classification presented in \nour previous report (Philip et al. 2005, 35\u201338, tabs 3\u20134). The latter drew very largely upon \nthe analysis of image data supported by a limited number of field visits. As a result of \nfieldwork under taken between 2007 and 2009 we feel that we now have a much better idea \nof the main site-types, and a better understanding of the associated material, and can thus \ndetermine the major temporal and spatial associations.  \nA. The archaeology of the Homs basalts in the Roman and later \nperiods[B] \nWithin the NSA, the project has recorded a number of small tells occupied by present-day \nsettlements, at which pottery of forms characteristic of the Graeco-Roman and\/or the Islamic \nperiods is prominent. These attest to occupation on a significant scale during the Roman and \nByzantine periods, although the ceramics suggest that this was preceded by some activity of \nHellenistic date.  \nHowever, the tells are supplemented by a number of additional sites, generally of a form that \nwe have termed Grouped rectilinear structures. A number of such sites are associated on the \nSyrian 1:50,000 map series with the place name khirba\u2019 \u0627\u0628\u0631\u062d) ), a toponym which appears to \nhave continued in use up to the present (for discussion see Philip et al. 2010). In many cases a \nbasic orthogonal plan can be identified either on the ground and\/or from satellite imagery, \nalthough the details are frequently obscured by rubble (Fig. 3, SHR 885 an example of the \nsite-class Grouped rectilinear structures). Sites of this category tend to occur along \nwatercourses, or in areas of relatively low-lying terrain, and are often associated with features \nsuch as water storage pools (birkat) and field systems. There is clear evidence, through \nsurface ceramics, and architectural fragments, such as lintels with inscriptions and shaped \nbasalt columns, that many are of Roman-Byzantine date, with occupation continuing into the \nIslamic periods. These sites we interpret as agricultural settlements, predominantly occupied \nin the Roman and later periods, and which either did not form tells, or were not founded upon \nearlier tells.  \nA second category of site, which we have termed Single rectilinear structures, includes a \nrange of free-standing individual architectural units, including built stone tombs and \nmausolea, agricultural structures such as mills and storage buildings, and perhaps even public \nbuildings of some kind (Philip et al. 2010). The majority of these occur in or around \nsettlements with good evidence for Graeco-Roman or later occupation and the surface \nindicators point to activity in the Roman, Byzantine or Islamic periods. An extensive \ncadastration, as a result of which the entire landscape was criss-crossed by field walls, is also \nlikely to belong to this period. However, the walls themselves are likely to represent a \npalimpsest, and more work needs to be done to establish the sequence and dates of the \nvarious components. For a more detailed account of Roman and later activity see Newson et \nal. (in press). \nB. The pre-classical archaeology of the Homs basalts: tells, grouped \nenclosures and cairns [B] \nOn present evidence the archaeological record of the Homs basalt in pre-classical times is \nevident in three main forms: tell sites, grouped enclosures and cairns. The term cairn is \npreferred to tumulus because the latter is almost universally used in association with mortuary \nactivity, something which should not be assumed in the case of all cairns in the NSA.  \n Tell sites in the Homs basalt [C] \nIn comparison with those of the marl landscape, tell sites in the NSA are fewer and are \ngenerally smaller. The majority of tells within the NSA are located in valley bottoms, usually \nclose to a seasonal water course, a distribution that contrasts with that of the irregular and \nsub-circular structures discussed below (Fig. 4).  \nIn this area, architectural units were traditionally constructed using undressed basalt blocks, \ncollected from the land surface (Na\u2018aman 1951, 49, confirmed by field observation). As a \nresult, site formation processes are not directly comparable with those that shaped tells in \nareas where mud brick architecture was the norm. Tells in the basalt are not formed by the \nsuccessive demolition, packing-down and rebuilding of mud brick architecture as described \nby Rosen (1986), but by the repeated reuse of stone masonry, both in the form of individual \nblocks and through the reincorporation of parts of earlier structures within later buildings. \nThese differences are brought to the fore by the use of massive blocks of masonry to form \nwhat we interpret as a major defensive wall, of uncertain date, on SHR 49 (Fig. 5). This sort \nof construction was presumably the local alternative to the type of layered earthen ramparts \nwhich are documented at several sites in the marl zone.  \nIn contrast to the situation in the marl landscape (Philip 2007), occupation on many tells in \nthe basalt extends beyond the Hellenistic and into the Roman\/Byzantine period. As a result, \nmuch of the earlier material from these sites is potentially obscured by later remains. This \nsituation is exacerbated by the fact that more than 70% of the tells are occupied by present-\nday settlements. For example, two of the tells with identified Chalco-EB activity currently lie \nbeneath modern settlements (SHR 860 and 888). Fortunately, occupation at SHR 49, the \nlargest example in the area (0.3 ha), appears to have ceased around the end of the Hellenistic \nperiod, and while much of the surface material from the tell itself is of Hellenistic date, \nChalco-EB material was also present (see Section 5 for discussion of dating), rendering SHR \n49 a key source for an understanding of earlier occupation at the tell sites. However, surface \ncollections undertaken in transects collected around the foot of the tell also produced Chalco-\nEB material The fact that (Fig. 6) Chalco-EB activity was not necessarily confined to the area \noccupied by the later tell\u2014in fact the tell may not have existed at this point\u2014raises important \nquestions regarding the nature of Chalco-EB activity at this and, we suspect, other subsequent \ntell locations, and their relationship with the more dispersed types of activity described \nbelow.  \nClearly, in local terms, the valley bottom land around SHR 49 should have represented prime \nagricultural land. Although, SHR 49 represents the site with the clearest evidence for 4th\u20133rd \nmillennium BC occupation, we should not ignore other potential locations (Fig. 4). A case in \npoint is the present-day village of Samalil (SHR 860), which is located 2 km south-west of \nSHR 49, along the same wadi course. Samalil, which remains under occupation, has revealed \nevidence for water mills and other agricultural activities of Roman-Byzantine date. However, \nit has also produced small quantities of Chalco-EB pottery, and is surrounded by a range of \ncairns and grouped enclosures, and so is likely to have also been of importance during earlier \nperiods. Another currently occupied tell (SHR 888) producing small quantities of Chalco-EB \nmaterial, has been identified along this same wadi to the south of SHR 860, while analysis of \nsatellite imagery has identified a further tell, Tell Kissine (Fig. 2), to the north of the NSA, \nlocated near the junction of the Wadi al-Qasab and Wadi Harb Nafseh. Whilst, presently un-\ndated it is possible that the latter site represents the northern-most outlier of a system of \noccupation locales centred on the Wadi al-Qasab. \nAnother site of interest is the Roman-Byzantine settlement of Dar es-Salaam, SHR 358 (Fig. \n4). The site is comprised of a central tell, surrounded by rubble mounds, which have been \nidentified as structures such as mausolea and agricultural buildings (Newson et al. in press). \nWhile material from this site is predominantly of Roman-Byzantine date, the tell has \nproduced a few basalt tempered sherds of a kind associated with Chalco-EB activity, while \ntransects around the site have revealed a good number of cairns. On the basis of the evidence \nfrom these three sites, we suspect that most, if not all, of the tells in the NSA were foci of \nactivity during the Chalco-EB, but that in most cases the evidence has been masked by the \ngreat quantity of later overburden. \n Grouped irregular structures [C] \nSites assigned to this category appear as clusters of structures, generally of sub-circular or \nirregular shape. Within the NSA, 75 examples of this site category have been identified, of \nwhich 20 have been visited in the field and have revealed evidence of Chalcolithic-EB \nactivity. The members of this type vary in size and density. Many take the form of tight \nclusters, which may be composed of between 12 and 40 individual units. The individual units \noften range between 5 and 20 m in diameter and are usually quite tightly packed. There is \nlittle evidence to suggest that the units were arranged around a central open area. While the \noverall impression is that the structures are laid-out in an irregular manner, a number appear \nto show a rough linear arrangement (Fig. 7). SHR 64, for example, encompasses around 40 \nindividual units and occupies an area of around 1.3 ha which is considerably larger than most \nothers of this type. In many instances the plans of sites of this type have been confused by \nlater activity, making detailed ground plans hard to establish. For example, fieldwork has \ndemonstrated that many of these features have later field walls built on top of, or running \nwithin and between, what appear to be earlier structures.  \nSHR 666, represents one of the best examples of this site-type within the NSA area (Fig. 7). \nWhile it has recently been badly damaged by bulldozing, the Ikonos imagery from 2002 (Fig. \n8) shows that the site consisted of a series of small irregular\/sub-circular enclosures, which \nrange between 5 to 20 m in diameter. Detailed planning using a differential GPS highlighted \na complex range of features in this area, with many of the walls visible at the site, possibly \npost-dating the irregular structures. Survey has demonstrated that there is a clear association \nbetween structures of this type and cairns (see Fig. 7, where cairns are visible as \u2018dots\u2019 \naround SHR 63, 913 and 914). In fact, analysis of satellite imagery has shown that more than \n80% of irregular structures have cairns located within a 100 m radius, while many have cairns \nbuilt within them. While the contemporaneity of irregular structures and cairns can rarely be \ndemonstrated by field survey, the close physical relationship between the two types of feature \nis highly suggestive. That said, small-scale soundings undertaken in 2008 demonstrated that \nrelationships could be ascertained in some cases, but that their elucidation would require \nexcavation on a larger scale. In the absence of the latter, dating is based upon surface finds, \nand so caution is required when attempting to assign categories of site to particular periods. \nHowever, while pottery of Roman-Byzantine date provides a kind of low-level \u2018background \nnoise\u2019 across much of the basalt landscape, all of the grouped enclosures examined to date \n(27% of the total identified), have shown a predominance of Chalco-EB types within their \nsurface ceramics.  \nWhile the few tells in this region are located in valley bottoms, close to the main \nwatercourses, the evidence from the NSA indicates that grouped enclosures tend to be located \non ridges or slopes above seasonal wadis, or close to seasonal lakes and pools (Fig. 4). The \nsites are not evenly distributed across the terrain, and there is a clear tendency for examples \nto occur in clusters, with sites sometimes located less than one kilometre apart. This \ndistribution has interesting implications for the nature of the activities with which such sites \nwere associated. The ridge-top locations would appear to argue against an agricultural \nassociation, perhaps even the deliberate avoidance of areas that were likely to be heavily \ncultivated. Moreover, the connections to seasonal pools and wadis would indicate that \nreasonable access to water was important. These facts, in combination with the nature of the \nsites themselves\u2014groups of walled enclosures\u2014would seem to point to an association with \nlivestock herding, presumably intended to exploit the extensive availability of water and \npasture during the late winter and spring which has traditionally characterized the basalt \nlandscape (Na\u2019aman 1951, 47).  \nAnalysis of 1960s Corona satellite imagery and Russian aerial photographs from the 1950s \nhas demonstrated that structures of the kinds identified within the NSA, are distributed \nelsewhere, across the area of basaltic geology. The morphology of structures outside the NSA \nsuggests that they are comparable in form and function to those discussed here, and might be \nunderstood as a related phenomenon. However, it is important to point out that while the \ndensity of cairns within the wider area is comparable to that observed in the NSA (see \nbelow), the density of built stone \u2018structures\u2019 is much lower outside the NSA. The difference \nmay be in-part attributable to the use of differential datasets, with a limited number of images \nof differing resolution being available for the wider region, in contrast to the NSA where a \nrange of high resolution imagery has been consulted. However, this does not fully explain the \ndiffering densities of structures within the NSA and wider study region. Moreover, research \nin the basalt terrain to the south and west of the NSA has identified a range of tumuli and \ncairn monuments, but the reports available make no mention of enclosure-type structures akin \nto those seen in the NSA (Ibanez et al. 2004\u20138). We suspect, therefore, that there is a genuine \nregional difference in the distributions of built stone structures. \nNo sites resembling the grouped enclosures can be seen within the Houleh depression, \nalthough a number of possible structures can be identified on the higher ground at the edge of \nthe depression. Such a distribution is consistent with observations from the NSA, where the \nsites are preferentially located above valley bottoms and areas of likely prime cultivation.  \nCairns [C] \nAs these monuments have been discussed in detail elsewhere (Bradbury and Philip in press) \nonly a short summary is provided here. Over 30,000 potential cairns have been identified \nwithin the NSA through image data. Of these, a sample, 525, have been recorded in the field. \nPreliminary analysis has shown that these monuments vary considerably in terms of \nmorphology and associated features. Ranging between 2 m and 20 m in diameter\/length and \nbetween 0.2 m and 2 m in height, cairns also display clear variation in shape, building \nmaterial and associated features. The distribution of similar monuments extends across large \nparts of the Levant from Turkey in the North to the Negev and Sinai in the South (Epstein \n1975; 1985; Haiman 1993; Prag 1995; Steimer-Herbet 2004; Steimer-Herbet and Braemer \n1999; Y\u00fckmen 2003; Zohar 1992).  \nWhile these issues are studied in more detail elsewhere, it is timely to mention that a spatial \nassociation can be demonstrated between a number of cairns and grouped sub-\ncircular\/irregular structures. Moreover, the cairns that have been found in association with \nthese structures often possess clear evidence for internal chambers and cists (Fig. 9). Even if \nthis may not always have meant that the chambers were actually used for the interment of the \ndead, it may still point to a symbolic connection with mortuary practice. Many cairns reveal \nan association with features such as walls and small enclosures. In some cases the walls \nappear either to connect one cairn with another, an attribute which has been observed \nelsewhere in the Levant (Bradbury and Philip in press; Thuesen 2004), or to demarcate or \n\u2018enclose\u2019 groups of cairns.  \nWhile it has been traditional to date the majority of cairns to the 4th and 3rd millennia BC \n(e.g. Steimer-Herbet 2004), research in areas such as the Negev has revealed evidence for \nmonuments dating to the 6th millennium BC (e.g. Avner 1984, 117; Avner and Carmi 2001, \n1215\u201316). The evidence from the NSA suggests that the practice of constructing, using and \nreusing cairns, may range in date from the Chalco-EB right through to the 18th\u201319th \ncenturies AD (Bradbury and Philip in press). That said, no cairns have produced good in situ \nmaterial, and most have been looted. However, the association of some cairns with enclosures \ndated to the 4th\u20133rd millennium BC, the presence of Chalco-EB pottery at 14% of the cairns \naround which surface collections were undertaken (the majority produced no ceramics at all), \nand the presence of chipped stone fragments of probable Chalco-EB date around 63% of the \ncairns surveyed, suggests that a good proportion of these monuments were first constructed \nduring the Chalco-EB. In contrast to the apparent association between cairns and grouped \nsub-enclosures, the paucity of cairns in valley bottom locations appears to dissociate the \ndistribution of cairns from that of the tells. Examination of wadi sections in the vicinity of \nSHR 49, suggests that sedimentation is generally of insufficient depth (1 m maximum, often \nmuch less) to render burial by colluvium a satisfactory explanation for their absence. Nor \ndoes the wholesale clearance of cairns from valley bottom locations during later periods (e.g. \nRoman-Byzantine) appear very likely: given the very stony nature of the landscape, the \nbenefit of such a process appears unlikely to have compensated for the labour cost of doing \nso. We therefore conclude, for the present, that cairns were simply not constructed in valley \nbottom locations in any significant numbers. The simplest way to interpret this is that their \nconstruction was focused upon areas other than the primary agricultural zones. \nThe large-scale distribution of cairns extends beyond NSA, and they are widely documented \nacross the basalt wa\u2018ar both to the north and west, where around 170,000 potential cairns \nhave been mapped using Corona imagery (see Section 5). In fact, the NSA may be unique not \nfor the presence of these monuments, but for the extent to which they had, at least until very \nrecently, been preserved. While the full implications of this distribution cannot be considered \nhere, their presence must be borne in mind when trying to interpret Chalco-EB activity within \nthe region. Unfortunately at least 60% of the cairns within the NSA that were identified using \nsatellite imagery dating to the late 1960s, have been destroyed by bulldozing activity within \nthe past decade, a process which is greatly impeding our ability to understand the context of \npast activity in the region. \n4. SHR 362: a unique circular enclosure [A] \nWe feel it useful to publish a substantial description of SHR 362 now, rather wait for the final \nsurvey report. The site was recently badly damaged, in part because the value of such low-\nvisibility, stone-walled enclosures as \u2018heritage\u2019 is not yet fully appreciated by local \ncommunities. Moreover a site like SHR 362 is very hard to recognize on the ground, and is, \nin fact, unlikely to have been identified, except by researchers using some form of remote \nsensing. When these factors are combined with the clear economic incentive for de-rocking \noperations, it is not difficult to see why such sites are readily destroyed by local farmers and \nlandowners. Thus, its rapid publication is in intended to alert colleagues to the possible \nexistence of similar sites in other regions of the Middle East, and to encourage their \nidentification, reporting and protection. A second reason is quite simply that the site is \ncurrently unique in Syria, although similar sites are known elsewhere in the Levant and \nArabia: these are currently dated to a range of different periods (e.g. Braemer and Sapin \n2001, 73\u201380, figs 1\u20133).  \nA. Landscape context [B] \nSHR 362 is a circular enclosure formed by a stone wall of variable construction that encloses \nan area 300 m in diameter (Fig. 10, Ikonos Image February 2002). Field examination \nrevealed that the structure not only had a complex structural history, but that it could best be \nunderstood as part of a wider landscape embracing both natural and anthropogenic elements. \nIn the late 1960s, SHR 362 was surrounded by an area of relict landscape, including a large \nnumber of cairns, visible as small dots on the image (Fig. 11 Corona Image 1108, December \n1969 showing contours). However, the areas to the east and south of the site had been cleared \nby 2002, as attested by the presence of long rectangular fields (compare Figs 10 and 11). \nWhen viewed in its full topographic context, it is apparent that the enclosure was positioned \non a short spur of slightly elevated ground, projecting eastwards from the hills to the west. \nThe northern boundary of the enclosure is positioned close to the break of the slope and thus \naffords a panoramic view over the Ghour-Samalil basin to the north, which was noted above \nas a potentially significant focus for local agricultural activity (Fig. 11). We suspect that this \nposition, overlooking the basin and the Wadi al-Qasab, both important locations for ancient \nsettlement, may have played an important part in the location of the enclosure.  \nB. Parallels and dating [B] \nAlthough preserved as recently as 2007, the site has now been substantially destroyed by \nbulldozing (Fig. 12). This is particularly unfortunate as the site is currently unique within this \npart of Syria. Nor has any comparable feature been identified through the analysis of Corona \nimagery covering the region between El-Hermel in the South and Hama in the North, \nalthough more extensive analysis of satellite imagery covering central Syria may reveal \nhitherto unknown examples. However, roughly circular enclosures have been documented \nwithin areas of southern Syria and the steppe-edge regions of North Jordan where they have \nbeen assigned to the EBA and identified as animal enclosures (Braemer and Sapin 2001, 73\u2013\n80, figs 1\u20133). However, these are all noticeably smaller than SHR 362, which would only \nhave been appropriate for the collection of rather large groups of livestock, and other \nexplanations may be better. Megalithic circles, associated with burial tumuli and dating to the \n18th\u201319th centuries AD were identified by Conder in the Dead Sea region and interpreted as \nimportant locales for tribal gatherings (Conder 1889, 134; Prag 1995, 80\u201381 and further \nreferences therein). In addition, the megalithic circles and associated features at al-Muraygh\u00e2t \nhave been recognized for hundreds of years (Savage 2010, 33\u201335). However, again these \nconstructions are much smaller than SHR 362. In terms of size, similar structures exist in \nArabia and have been interpreted as \u2018sacred enclaves\u2019 and tribal gathering places, known \nwithin literature as \u2018hauta\u2019, \u2018\u1e25\u012bma\u2019 and \u2018\u1e25aram\u2019. These structures range in date, based on \narchaeological evidence, from the 6th\u20138th centuries BC, although others have suggested that \nthey show the influence of earlier traditions (Doe 1971, 76\u201377; Doe 1983, 124\u201325, 160\u201365; \nGawlikowski 1982, 301). Clearly none of these examples can be used as a direct analogy for \nSHR 362, although their identification as central locales may be more in line with possible \nutilizations of SHR 362 than interpretations suggesting its use as an animal enclosure. \nFigure 10 reveals that the north-eastern part of the enclosure was disrupted by the later \nconstruction of a series of small rectilinear fields. While these cannot be dated on field \nevidence, the 1969 Corona imagery (Fig. 11), reveals that the field walls which obliterate the \nnorth side of 362 are similar in size, shape and alignment to those located immediately below \nthe north and west sides of the present-day settlement of Heissa. It seems reasonable to \nsuggest the walls are contemporary with periods of peak activity at Heissa. Unfortunately, the \nsurface material from Heissa embraces quantities of material of Roman-Byzantine and \nIslamic date, and so the field walls can provide only very broad terminus ante quem for the \nconstruction of the circular enclosure.  \nTwo small soundings made in 2008, whilst highlighting the nature of construction used for \nthe enclosure wall, produced no artefactual remains, and surface collection produced only \noccasional small abraded sherds with little potential for dating. However, surface collection \nundertaken in 2009, in recently bulldozed areas of the site, produced a single sherd of chaff \ntempered pottery in Fabric 5 (see Section 4), along with one or two highly abraded sherds of \nprobable Roman-Byzantine date: sporadic examples of the latter are relatively common \nacross the basalt landscape. While one chaff-tempered sherd cannot provide firm dating \nevidence for the structure, it does raise the possibility that its construction and use might best \nbe understood in the context of the expansion of human activity in the NSA during the \nChalco-EB, that is broadly contemporary with activity associated with the grouped enclosures \nand cairns.  \nC. The nature of the structural elements [B] \nAs a large part of the central area had already been bulldozed by 2002, this account will focus \nupon the main features of the enclosure wall. All points discussed in this section are marked \non Figure 10, in the form 362_1_XXX. The circuit begins at Point 362_1_247 (henceforth the \nterm \u2018362_1-\u2019 will be omitted in this discussion), the start of a stretch of low curving wall, of \nwidth 5 m and which is composed of two distinct faces each visible as a single course of \nstones separated by a core of loosely-packed rubble, and proceeds around the enclosure in a \nclockwise direction. The wall continues in this form to Point 202, where for a distance of \nsome 5 m the wall line is set noticeably closer to the ground surface, giving the appearance of \nan entrance or threshold-like feature. From Point 204 the wall as preserved on the surface \ntakes the form of a single row of stones (Fig. 13) sitting within a scatter of smaller rubble: \nthis stretch of the wall is 3 m in width and it is no longer easy to identify a clear wall-face. An \narea of basalt paving of 5 m in diameter, and located just outside the wall was observed at \nPoint 205. While the \u2018paving\u2019 may simply represent the outcropping of natural basalt slabs, \nthe possibility that this represented some kind of deliberate arrangement should not be \noverlooked.  \nAn unusual feature appears at Point 217 where two stones were set vertically to form low \npillars between which two slabs were laid horizontally to form a gap of width 3.5 m (Fig. 14). \nFrom the interior of the circle the gap appears to \u2018frame\u2019 a large cairn of diameter c. 30 m \nlocated at Point 220 and which has a rectilinear enclosure on its north-eastern side. While it is \nimpossible to be certain without excavation, it seems rather unlikely that such an arrangement \nis the result of natural processes. In fact, the extent to which features of SHR 362 appear to \ncontinue below the current ground level is clearly indicated by the cairn in Figure 15. \nBeyond this point, the circuit presents not one but two walls, forming an inner and an outer \ncircuit. Moreover, in clear contrast to that part of the line discussed previously, both the inner \nand outer walls incorporate cairns, with the wall appearing to run between and connect them. \nThe complexity of the situation is exemplified by a break in the inner wall-line located \nimmediately south of a cairn at Point 223, and which appears to be aligned with a \ncorresponding break in the outer wall-line. The wall then resumes as a low rubble mound of \nwidth 3 m. Between Points 236 and 237 the curve of the wall changes direction, and despite \nthe presence of a number of cairns in this area, the wall appears to navigate through the \nspaces between them, rather than to link them\u2014an interesting variation. It is also in this area \nthat the vista over the depression to the north discussed above, is most apparent (Fig. 16).  \nBy Point 237, the wall has become very difficult to follow, presumably because much of the \nstone was reused in the construction of the later field walls. The wall can be identified again \nat Point 238 where it appears to combine large stones and smaller rubble forming a long heap \nof stones 4 m in width. The wall can clearly be seen to join three pre-existing cairns at Points \n239\u201341: two of the cairns have sub-rectilinear enclosures attached to their eastern sides. \nAnother instance of a large stone block positioned horizontally along the wall exists at Point \n242, where it provides a framing device for a group of cairns beyond the enclosure (Fig. 17). \nA large wall running from the exterior abuts the enclosure wall at Point 246 (Fig. 18), and \nfrom this point onwards the wall is double-faced with a \u2018hollow\u2019 core. In effect, the enclosure \nwall appears to have assumed the form of the large abutting wall, and the main perimeter wall \ncontinues in its double faced form, as far as Point 247 where this account began. \nSHR 362 is a complicated entity that was almost certainly constructed and modified over an \nextended period. The close relationship between the wall and the cairns is clear. In some \nareas the wall links groups of cairns together, and must therefore be later than the building of \nthe cairns. In other cases, it appears to specifically avoid cairns, unless those all post-date the \nconstruction of the wall. In some areas gaps in the wall, some emphasized by quite specific \narrangements of stone, appear to be aligned with cairns suggesting that the two elements were \nintimately connected, while the presence of cairns within the enclosure, and occasional \ncircular arrangements of orthostats projecting out of the ground, all point to a complex, if \nsomewhat enigmatic, structure. \nIt is clear that care had been taken with regard to its location in terms of local landscape \nfeatures, a point noted above. Equally the rectilinear field systems which have removed, or in \nsome cases adapted, the northern section of the wall line appear to represent a change in the \nimportance and use of this structure at some point during the Roman through to the Islamic \nperiod. Thus, the complexity of this site appears to extend beyond that of its construction to \nits placement within the landscape and association with potentially later and earlier features.  \n5. The nature of activity in the basalt (tells, cairns and enclosures) [A] \nA. Material culture and chronology (Figs 19 and 20) [B] \n \nThe distribution of chipped stone forms, which have to date provided the sole convincing \nevidence for the exploitation of the basalt landscape during the Neolithic, suggests that \nactivity was focused upon a limited number of areas, in particular in the vicinity of seasonal \nlakes. Given the obvious attraction of such features to wildlife, this is not unexpected. The \nevidence for Neolithic occupation is therefore limited, in terms of both quantity and its \ndistribution \nHowever, surface collections from the grouped enclosures and collection units walked in \ntheir immediate vicinity, suggest a focus of activity of Chalco-EB date. As these sites consist \nmainly of concentrations of stone, they have remained largely unploughed. As a result, \nsurface finds are few and consist of small heavily abraded sherds, and occasional fragments \nof chipped stone: diagnostic forms are all but absent. Ironically, the destruction of surface \nremains by bulldozing tends to produce a richer and more diverse artefactual assemblage, and \nthus offers greater possibilities for its characterization.  \nCeramic collections from grouped enclosures revealed the existence of two main fabric \nclasses: basalt-tempered and chaff-tempered. While we recognize the problems inherent in \nattempting to identify distinct fabrics within a database made up of small numbers of sherds \ncollected from a number of different sites, and which may cover a considerable period of \ntime, we believe that some basic distinctions can be made within the material (Table 1, Fig. \n19). \n  \nFabric \nNo. \nCharacteristics \n1 Dark red-brown mineral tempered has large, angular, basalt inclusions \n2  Dark red-brown mineral tempered with smaller, gritty basalt (and other) inclusions  \n3 Similar to Fabric 2 but contains an appreciable quantity of chaff temper, examples \noften have a reddish orange exterior and a dark core \n4  Similar to Fabric 3 but contains both basalt and chaff temper and reveals evidence \nof either smoothing or burnishing of the vessel exterior \n5  Buff-orange, chaff tempered, with distinctive grey core. It is unlikely that these \nvessels could have been produced using clays that were readily available within the \nbasalt landscape \n \nTable 1. The main pre-classical Fabrics from the NSA.  \n \nRim Form Fabric 1 Fabric 2 Fabric 3 Fabric 4 Fabric 5 Total \nEverted Rim 0 5 1 0 2 8 \nHolemouth Jar 10 1 2 3 3 19 \nInverted Rim 0 0 0 0 1 1 \nUnclassified 1 4 0 5 1 11 \nTotals 11 10 3 8 7 39 \n \nTable 2. Diagnostic rim forms from 2008 NSA surface collections. \nBasalt-tempered pottery is predominant, and is most probably a local product. Table 2 shows \nthat Fabric 1, the coarsest form, shows a strong association with the holemouth vessel form, \nwhile the finer basalt-tempered fabrics (Fabrics 2\u20134 might best be understood as variants on a \ncommon theme) appear in both holemouth and everted-rim forms. We assume that the vessels \nconcerned were jars of some kind. Moreover, as only one fragment of a flat-base has been \nidentified, we believe that most of these jars were round-based forms. Overall, the evidence \nattests to a rather limited range of vessel-forms: no fine-wares have been identified. \nIn the absence of published Chalco-EB ceramic assemblages from the areas immediately to \nthe north, west and south of the NSA, the closest excavated comparison comes from Trench \nVIII at Tell Nebi Mend (Matthias 2000). However, neither the basaltic fabrics, nor the \nholemouth form, have ready parallels there. Nor have examples been identified from surface \ncollections undertaken by the current project at sites in the marl zone to the east of the \nOrontes.  \nWhile holemouth forms are present among the chaff-faced ware forms reported from the \nAmuq (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960, 235\u201336, fig. 176. 1\u20134), they are specifically noted \nas being infrequent. They are also present in Phase K at Hama where they are classed as \nShape VI (Thuesen 1988, 118, fig. 59) and are described as \u2018uncharacteristic for Period K\u2019 \n(Thuesen 1988, 118, fig. 59), and are associated with globular jar forms produced in coarse \nfabrics. Holemouth cooking pots, in this case with a ridged rim, are documented at Tell Afis, \nwhere they are believed to be of EB IV date (Mazzoni and Giannessi 1998, 31, fig. 16.7\u20138).  \nIn contrast, the holemouth jar is one of the most distinctive features of 4th and 3rd \nmillennium BC ceramic assemblages from the southern Levant, where these vessels served \nboth cooking and storage functions. In this area holemouths are seen in both early Chacolithic \n(5th millennium) and late Neolithic contexts (e.g. Lovell 2002, 112, 115, 132\u201337, figs 4.4\u20135, \n4.14\u201316). Examples are also documented in EB I and II contexts in the Jordan valley (Fischer \n2008, 281\u201384), EB III in west-central Jordan (Harrison 2000, 355, fig. 19.6) and right \nthrough the EB I\u2013III sequence at Khirbet Kerak, where examples are present from Local \nStrata 15 (EB IB), through to Phase 6 (Final EB) of the Bar Adon excavations in Area BS \n(Greenberg and Eisenberg 2006). The form also occurs at sites in southern Syria (Braemer \nand \u00c9challier et al. 2004, 298, figs 546\u201350) and the Beq\u2019a Valley (Marfoe 1995, fig. 45, 46.4, \n6) during the EBA.  \nJars with a simple everted rim have general parallels in Trench VIII at Tell Nebi Mend, \nalthough here they are mostly made using the gritty Fabric A which is not basalt-tempered \n(Matthias 2000, 419, fig. 23.2. 1\u20138). Round-based jars with everted rims have parallels in the \nmineral tempered \u2018Cooking Pot wares\u2019 of Amuq F (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960, 241\u201342, \nfig. 175. 2\u20134, fig. 182. 2\u20139) and the form is common in the Phase K sequence at Hama, where \nit is termed Shape VA1 (Thuesen 1988, 117\u201318, fig. 59). It is generally produced in coarse \nware, and was \u2018the most common pottery shape in the inventory\u2019 (Thuesen 1988, 117\u201318, fig. \n59), present in all but Phase K1. Everted-rim jars are also well-documented in Late \nChalcolithic Level 18 at Tell Afis (Mazzoni and Giannessi 1998, 17, figs 4\u20135), which they \nview as broadly equivalent to Amuq F (Mazzoni and Giannessi 1998, 23\u201325, tab. 19). To \nsummarize, the combination of both the holemouth and everted rim jar forms would be \nconsistent with a date within the broad span of the 4th and 3rd millennia BC.  \nFabric 5 as described here, resembles very closely what is termed Fabric C in the Trench VIII \nsequence at Tell Nebi Mend (Matthias 2000, 419). At Nebi Mend, Fabric C was used mainly \nfor bowls, although it was also used for the production of thick-walled ovoid or globular jars \nwith a short-everted neck (Matthias 2000, 419\u201322, fig. 23.3.15\u201332). In wider terms this \nmaterial is best understood as a local manifestation of the chaff-tempered tradition \ncharacteristic of Amuq F, and which is documented in the northern Levant from the end of \nthe 5th and through much of the 4th millennium BC calibrated (Schwartz 2001, 237\u201341, \n245). \nAt TNM, Fabric 5 is first documented in Phase 6 of the Trench VIII sequence, which recent \nradiometric dates would place in the early part of the 4th millennium BC calibrated \n(information courtesy of Mr Peter Parr). However, the ware continues to appear as late as \nPhase 16, that is just prior to the appearance of classic EB IV ceramic forms. In this case, too, \na date in the 4th or earlier 3rd millennia BC calibrated would be indicated. \nWhile a few examples of probable EB IV ceramic forms have been identified at sites in the \nbasalt, thus far these have been restricted to occupations on or around the tell sites (e.g. SHR \n49, 860). Unequivocal EB IV material has not yet been recorded from the grouped \nenclosures, suggesting that the associated activity had ceased by the mid-3rd millennium BC \ncalibrated. Admittedly the sample remains small, and it might be argued that the users of the \ngrouped enclosures practiced a lifestyle that did not require the use of an EB IV ceramic \nrepertory. However, the very clear presence of EB IV forms at sites in the marl landscape east \nof the Orontes in the Hauran (Braemer and \u00c9challier et al. 2004, 305, 326 fig. 552, 584), in \nthe Beq\u2019a (Marfoe 1995, 54 and 55), and in the steppe margins east of Homs and Hama \n(Castel 2007; Geyer 2007), renders this view hard to accept. We conclude, therefore, that \nactivity associated with the grouped enclosures should be dated to the 4th and\/or earlier 3rd \nmillennia BC. At present, we cannot be certain whether, within this broad period, the various \ngrouped enclosures were used contemporaneously or in succession. However, as a working \nhypothesis, we are inclined to suggest that individual locations are likely to have witnessed \nnumerous occupations over an extended period.  \nB. Towards an interpretation [B] \nWhile the ceramic collections from tell sites in the basalt are modest, it is worth noting that \nthe material, from these, and in particular from SHR 49 and the transects immediately below \nthis site, are broadly comparable in terms of shapes and fabrics with that from the grouped \nenclosures (Table 3). In other words, this material is characteristic of activity in the basalt \nlandscape generally, leading to the conclusions that the tells and enclosures form part of a \ncoherent system of landscape use.  \nM\najo\nr ID\n \nS\nu\nb\n ID\n \nS\nq\nr ID\n \nS\nite T\ny\np\ne \nH\no\nlem\no\nu\nth\ns \nJars (U\np\nrig\nh\nt rim\ns) \nE\nv\nerted\n\/O\nu\nflarin\ng\n \nR\nim\n \nJars \nE\nv\nerted\n\/O\nu\ntflarin\ng\n \nR\nim\n \nB\no\nw\nl\/P\nlatter fo\nrm\ns \nU\np\nrig\nh\nt rim\n b\no\nw\nl fo\nrm\ns \nB\nases \nL\ned\ng\ne H\nan\nd\nle \nS\ntrap\n H\nan\nd\nle \nL\nid\n? \n7 1 100 E 14                 \n49 1 100 T 2     4 1         \n62 1 100 E     1 1           \n64 1 100 E     1 1           \n358 1 762 T             1     \n362 1 100 Circle 1                 \n666 1 100 E 4     3           \n666 1 200  \n1 1   2 2         \n666 1 1200  1   1             \n850 1 100 E               1   \n866 1 100 T 1                 \n914 1 100 E     1             \n915 1 100 E             1     \n920 1 100 Tr       1   1       \n991 1 100 Tr  1 1 1 1           \n1179 1 100 Tr 1   1             \n1184 1 100 Tr 4   1             \n1197 1 100 \nTr 1   1           1 \n \nTable 3. Diagnostic forms from basalt sites preliminarily dated to the Chalcolithic-EBA \nperiod (see map for locations) E=enclosure T=tell, Tr=Transect immediately below tell. \nIf the concentration of tells sites in the wadi bottom locations indicates an association \nbetween these communities and cereal cultivation in wadi bottom landscapes, then the \nlocation of the grouped enclosures, around seasonal lakes, and along the slopes of wadi \nsystems, and thus away from the prime agricultural zones, suggests an association with \nlivestock herding. This interpretation is consistent with Na\u2018aman\u2019s (1951, 46\u201348) comment \non the importance of pasture within this landscape during March\u2013May. As this period would \nhave coincided with the vital pre-harvest phase for cereal crops planted in wadi bottom \nagricultural zones, the strategy of removing livestock to rich upland pastures would make \ngood sense. Were this combined with harvesting of grasses to serve as winter fodder, the \nvalue of this strategy would have been further enhanced. The possibility that local \ncommunities might have taken additional animals from areas to the east in years when \ngrazing was particularly abundant (Na\u2018aman 1951, 46\u201347) should be borne in mind, but \ncannot, at present be demonstrated.  \nThus we believe that we have delineated, not simply evidence for pastoralists, but rather an \nintegrated settlement system which underpinned the effective exploitation of the subsistence \npossibilities offered by the basalt landscape. As the indications for activity in earlier periods \nare limited, and focused upon seasonal water bodies, the evidence suggests that the basalt \nregion witnessed a substantial increase in both the scale and intensity of human activity in the \n4th millennium BC. It is tempting to see this as involving both a greater intensity of \ncultivation in the wadi bottoms, and an increase in the scale of livestock herding, to such an \nextent as to encourage their removal from the agricultural zones at a critical point in the \ngrowing season.  \nC. Material culture connections [B] \nThere are some similarities between the ceramic assemblage from the sites in the basalt and \nthat of contemporary settlements in the marl zone, in particular Tell Nebi Mend and SHR 94 \n(located on the east bank of the Orontes close north of Homs), both of which have produced \ngood assemblages of 4th and 3rd millennium BC material. These include: the predominance \nof round-based vessels; the occurrence of jars with an everted rim (Matthias 2000, s 23.2.1\u2013\n14, 22.3.15\u201322) and the presence of chaff-tempered Fabric C, which resembles Fabric 5 from \nthe basalt sites. Thus the ceramics documented in the basalt region resemble to some extent \nthose from 4th and early 3rd millennium BC assemblages in the marl zone immediately east \nof the Orontes. However, there are differences. Firstly the distinctive holemouth jar form, \nwhich is so characteristic of the basalt zone, has not been recorded at either TNM or SHR 94, \ndespite large collections in each case. Secondly, there is little or no evidence at either site for \nthe presence of the distinctive basalt-tempered fabrics. In fact, the ceramic connections of the \nbasalt sites might be seen as related as much to a \u2018generic\u2019 4th millennium BC north Levant \nrepertory, as documented in the Amuq (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960), and at Hama \n(Thuesen 1988) and Tell Afis (Mazzoni and Giannessi 1998) as to the sites east of the \nOrontes specifically.  \nOn present evidence, despite the occasional occurrences in the Orontes Valley region listed \nabove, the holemouth jar form finds its best parallels in the southern Levant. Direct \ncomparisons based upon rim-morphology, however, can be misleading, as the holemouth jar \nform most characteristic of the EBA in the southern Levant is a flat-based vessel. However, \nGreenberg (2006, 40\u201341, fig. 1.1\u20134, 9\u201310) has observed that EBA sites in the inland valleys \nof northern Palestine have produced examples of round-based cooking pots with both \nholemouth and everted rims: both rim forms are documented in the Homs basalts. He further \nsuggests (Greenberg 2006, 42\u201343), that in northern Palestine at least, these vessels reflect the \nexistence of a manufacturing tradition which existed separately from the main regional \nceramic industry. Such a distinction might support the suggestion that there existed, among \ncommunities using the basalt landscape west of the Orontes, a ceramic tradition which \ndiffered in key respects from that documented in the main regional centres in the adjacent \nmarl zone. In light of their locations at the northern and southern ends of the Beq\u2019a valley \nrespectively, the parallels between the situations in the Homs basalts and in the inland valleys \nof northern Palestine (Greenberg 2006) is intriguing, although it would be premature to \nsuggest a direct connection between these two phenomena on present evidence. That said, it \nis by no means clear that all of the holemouth jars from the enclosure sites were cooking as \nopposed to storage vessels. In fact, the storage of dry-goods, in damp-proof vessels as \nopposed to sacks or baskets, might have been an important element in the maintenance of \nmembers of a community in the upland stretches of the Homs basalt during the potentially \nrainy spring season.  \n6. Connectivity, mobility and local trajectories: the development of \u2018sub-\noptimal\u2019 zones in the Levant during the 4th and 3rd millennia BC [A] \nA useful way in which to approach the place of regions and their relationships within a wider \nlandscape, is through the work of Horden and Purcell (2000, 54) who emphasize that they \nmust be understood not just in their own ecological terms, but also within the relevant \npolitical, social and economic contexts, and through an understanding of the interdependence \nof local and more distant developments. The Homs basalts are particularly well-suited for \nsuch a study as they are located close to a region which witnessed a significant expansion of \ntell-based settlement during the 3rd millennium BC, and the development of major polities \nsuch as Qatna and Kadesh during the 2nd millennium BC (Klengel 1992). However, there is \ncurrently no evidence to indicate that grouped enclosure sites were used during the Middle or \nLate Bronze Ages or the Iron Age. In fact, the evidence for activity in the Homs basalt during \nthese periods is restricted to a handful of tell sites. (We do not propose to discuss this in detail \nhere, but simply make the point in order to highlight the overall pattern.)  \nThus the basalt landscape appears to have witnessed two main pulses of activity. The second \nwas during the Roman-Byzantine period (Newson et al. in press), the explanation for which \nshould be in the context of wider developments in the Graeco-Roman world, and the first in \nthe 4th\u2013early 3rd millennium BC. The marked difference between the nature of the human \nactivity described here, and the stone-built villages and cereal-based economy, that is \ndocumented for the Roman-Byzantine period, highlights the very different ways in which a \nsingle landscape can be exploited, depending upon the nature of the wider political and \neconomic developments which are driving change.  \nIt is therefore interesting to ask why we see periodic expansions and contractions, rather than \nsimply a sustained, low-level of activity, as the latter would certainly appear consistent with \nthe potential of the landscape. This is probably best understood if we view the Homs basalt as \na \u2018microregion\u2019, the diachronic trajectory of which can only be understood \u2018through the \ninvocation of a full political, social or economic context\u2019 (Horden and Purcell 2000, 53\u201354). \nThus, the changes detectable in the local archaeological record are best understood in terms \nof its \u2018connectivity\u2019, i.e. the region\u2019s linkages to social and economic developments on a \nlarger spatial scale (Horden and Purcell 2000, 5). \nWhile Horden and Purcell (2000) focus in their discussion of \u2018connectivity\u2019 around the \nMediterranean upon maritime transport, this mechanism is probably inappropriate for the \nOrontes Valley in the 4th millennium BC. However, there are changes documented at this \ntime, which are more directly relevant, and in the context of livestock herding and the \nmaintenance of communities over dispersed locations, two particular developments seem \nimportant.  \nBoth the production and distribution of woollen textiles were of vital importance to the \npolitical economy of Mesopotamia by the later 4th millennium BC (Algaze 2008, 77\u201381; \nBreniquet 2008, 208\u201319 with further references). One might surmise therefore that this would \nhave created both an increased demand for wool at a regional scale, but also a growing \nawareness of its significance as a potential source of wealth, even beyond those areas that \nwere influenced directly by Mesopotamian demand. This appears to be confirmed by the \niconographic and archaeofaunal data which also point to a growing emphasis upon wool-\nbearing sheep and textile production during the later 4th millennium BC (McCorriston 1997, \n517ff; Redding 1993; Vila 1998, 111\u201312). The marked increase in the proportion of caprines \nwithin the faunal assemblage associated with the appearance of elements of Uruk-type \nmaterial culture at Hacinebi Tepe in south-east Anatolia (Stein 2002, 152, fig. 15), may be \npart of this trend. The first indirect result of the growing importance of wool production may \nhave been to alert the populations across a wide swathe of the Near East to the new economic \nopportunities, and thus incentivize the development of opportunities for grazing in areas that \nhad hitherto been only modestly exploited. The second is the limited, but now expanding, \nbody of evidence for the use of donkeys as transport-animals during the 4th millennia BC \ncalibrated in the Near East (Grigson 2006, 224, 233; Vila 1998, 46, both with further \nreferences) and Egypt (Rossel et al. 2008). While equids are well-known from earlier \ncontexts, their use as beasts of burden is predominantly viewed as a 4th millennium BC \ndevelopment (Grigson 1995, 258; Grigson 2006, 233). While the sheep raising provides a \nsound economic reason for the exploitation of the grazing opportunities offered by the basalt \nlandscape, the growing availability of transport animals would have considerably facilitated \nthe movement of equipment, such as ceramic cooking and storage vessels, and other supplies, \nto those members of the community who were using the grouped enclosure sites as part of a \nseasonal herding strategy. Thus we suggest that the domestication of the donkey would have \nplayed a key role in making such a new economic strategy viable.  \nIn such a situation, access to good grazing land would have become increasingly important, \nand thus the appearance of a large number of stone burial cairns across a prime grazing \nlandscape might be understood as evidence of a growing desire to assert a tangible \nconnection with specific tracts of land. Following this line of argument, the absence of cairns \nfrom the valley bottoms could be read as an indication that the presence of living settlements \nsuch as SHR 49 and 860, and the associated cultivated land represented, in themselves, a \nclear and tangible demonstration of rights of access, and that no further marking was \nrequired. However, in a seasonally occupied landscape, and in a situation where pressure \nupon grazing was growing, the construction of cairns may have become a way of \ndemonstrating rights to a type of landscape which had hitherto been of limited interest, but \nwhich was now undergoing a process of revaluation as a result of new economic \nopportunities. Equally the location of SHR 362, overlooking a key wadi basin, and the \ncomplex relationship that appears to exist between the cairns, walls, uprights and \u2018framing \ndevices\u2019 from which the structure as a whole is composed, appears consistent with the more \ngeneral use of stone structural elements in the development of a sense of \u2018place\u2019 and \n\u2018presence\u2019. \nOne might initially tend to view the Homs basalt as a hinterland, an area which could be \nbrought into use as and when required to serve the needs of a prime consumer zone. One \npossibility is that this region was being used by inhabitants of the southern marls. However, if \nthis was the case, for example with livestock from the southern marls being grazed within the \nbasalt west of the Orontes on a regular basis, we might have expected evidence of cultural \naffinity between the pottery repertoires to have been rather greater than presently appears to \nbe the case. In fact, the ceramic parallels with southern Syria, the Beq\u2019a, and northern \nPalestine suggest that we need to look beyond ideas of a simple one to one relationship with \nthe area east of the Orontes. One possible explanation for this is found in the hypothesis that \nactivity in the Homs basalt during the 4th\u20133rd millennium BC merely represented an \namplification of activity, which had already been taking place within the region, albeit at a \nmuch lower level of intensity. However, the very mention of \u2018sound economic reasons\u2019 \nrequires us to address contemporary developments at a regional scale. \nA. The importance of timing [B] \nIn many parts of the near east, the 4th millennium BC is characterized by growing, and very \ntangible, inter-regional connections and an increase in the scale and complexity of \ncommunities \u2018economic and political organizations\u2019 some of this clearly driven by \ndevelopments in southern Mesopotamian (Algaze 2005, Rothman 2001; Stein 1999). \nHowever, evidence for Mesopotamian connections in the upper Orontes Valley remains \nlimited (Philip 2002; Schwartz 2001), and it is unlikely that the expansion documented in \nHoms can be directly linked to this process. \nAs far as the Levant goes, the Beq\u2019a Valley witnessed a significant expansion in the settled \narea during the 4th and 3rd millennia (Marfoe 1995, Late Chalcolithic\/Early Bronze I and EB \nII\u2013III phases) and a growing degree of settlement agglomeration in the EB II\u2013III (Marfoe \n1995, 119\u201324, figs 26\u201328). The Amuq underwent a major period of settlement agglomeration \nand the development of substantial tell-sites in the earlier part of the 3rd millennium BC \n(Casana 2007, 199). Equally, preliminary analysis of the evidence from the SHR project \nsuggest that the 4th millennium BC witnessed a noticeable increase in the scale of settlement \nin the marl zone east of the Orontes, and that this was followed by a degree of settlement \nagglomeration during the earlier 3rd millennium BC. In contrast, there is considerably less \nevidence for activity during these periods in more easterly regions, closer to the edge of the \nsteppe (Geyer 2007; Morandi Bonacossi 2007), where clear evidence for a major expansion \nof settlement comes only from the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, the EB IV period in \nparticular. The latter process, therefore, appears to represent a phase of expansion that is quite \nseparate from that documented in the Homs basalts. In fact, the limited evidence for later \noccupation in the basalt may be because of the development of steppe herding strategies from \nthe late 3rd millennium onwards, with the basalt landscape being simply superseded, and \nreverting to a pattern of small sedentary villages in lowland locations, as typified by SHR 49. \nIn contrast, the later part of the 4th millennium BC witnessed significant expansion of \nsettlement in the northern valleys of the southern Levant. In the north Jordan Valley, the late \n4th millennium BC (late EB I) occupations at Khirbet Kerak and Tell esh-Shuna attained \naround 20 ha in size in each case (Greenberg et al. 2006, 12\u201313, plan 1.1, tab. 1.2; Philip \n2008, 187). In the Jezreel Valley, recent surveys indicate the presence of a late EB I artefact \nscatter covering some 60 ha at \u2018Ain al-Assawir at the western end of the Wadi \u2018Arah (Yannai \n2006, 280), while the settled area of contemporary Megiddo has been estimated at some 50 \nha (Finkelstein et al. 2006a; 2006b, 845). (Note, though, that the Megiddo Hinterland Project \nappears to report 12 ha for the total area of the EB I occupation at Tell Megiddo [Finkelstein \net al. 2006b, 721\u201322, sites 30\u201335].) In fact, a large swathe of north-central Palestine and \nTransjordan witnessed the development of extensive, but apparently unfortified settlements, \nat key points in the landscape during the late 4th millennium BC, although the rather different \nsituation documented in southern Syria highlights the importance of quite local trajectories \n(Braemer in press). Although we do not suggest that there was a direct link between these \nsites and expansion in the Homs basalts, the data is indicative of the scale of developments \nthat were taking place within even those regions of the Levant located well outside the \neconomic impact zone of the Uruk phenomenon.  \nB. Chalco-EB activity in \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 landscapes: an alternative to \npastoral nomadism [B] \nAs the patterns outlined from the Homs region seem to suggest, we appear to have a two-\ntiered system of settlement consisting of valley based \u2018tell\u2019 settlements and upland \u2018grouped \nenclosures\u2019. However, contrary to recent archaeological interpretations which highlight the \nrole of \u2018nomadic pastoralists\u2019 in the construction of settlements and monuments in \u2018sub-\noptimal\u2019 regions, there is little evidence to suggest the presence of two distinct \npopulation\/social groups within the Homs region during this 4th\u20133rd millennium BC period. \nDespite the richness of resources, such as the Mari texts, which pertain to nomad-sedentary \nrelations during 2nd millennium BC and beyond (e.g. Kupper 1957; Anbar 1991; Matthews \n2002; Buccellati 2008), we know relatively little about the ways in which pastoralism may \nhave operated during the 4th\u20133rd millennium BC. Moreover, given the major changes in the \nexploitation of the steppe zone detectable during the later 3rd millennium (e.g. Castel 2007; \nCastel and Peltenburg 2007; Geyer 2007), which were almost certainly shaped by broader \npolitical and economic developments, we should be cautious of assuming too great a degree \nof similarity.  \n The seasonal and variable nature of resources and environmental conditions in the Homs \nregion as outlined by Na\u2019aman (1951), fits well with evidence from other regions, which \nhighlight the need for groups to be able to move their emphasis between a range of \nsubsistence strategies within a single annual round. Indeed, this flexibility may have been a \nkey factor in enabling groups to operate within such \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 landscapes (e.g. Dyson-\nHudson and Dyson-Hudson 1980, 17; Lancaster and Lancaster 1991, 128, 136; Braemer \n1999, 191; Braemer and \u00c9challier et al. 2004, 158). If, as suggested above, we are dealing \nwith a period when changing notions of land rights arose to reflect new opportunities arising \nfrom a growing emphasis on woollen textiles, and the availability of donkey transport, it is \nclear that these changes would also be linked into new concepts of location, and to the \nrevaluation of both products and resources. The resulting changed patterns of activity and \nseasonality would thus have shaped a rather different engagement with the landscape (see \nPhilip 2003 for a related example).  \nWithin the Homs region, rather than representing a complete departure from previous \nsubsistence strategies and a clear separation between nomadic and sedentary populations, we \nsuggest that this process represented an intensification of subsistence practices that were \nalready in place, albeit at a much lower level of activity. As such, we can perhaps suggest that \na similar pattern of activity would have occurred in areas such as the Hauran, where both \nagricultural and pastoralist activities appear to be occurring alongside one another (Braemer \nand \u00c9challier et al. 2004, 282\u201383). Thus, the key to gaining a deeper understanding of the \nnature of 4th\u20133rd millennium BC period activity within the Homs basalts and other \u2018sub-\noptimal\u2019 zones may be to challenge the distinction between the notions of sedentary and \nnomadic activity during this point in time, and suggest that multi-resource strategies were \noperating within these regions.  \nIt is worth considering at this point the extent to which activity and occupation within \u2018sub-\noptimal\u2019 regions can be seen as representative of a single process. In order to do this we will \nbriefly review current evidence within the Levant for nomad-sedentary interaction, before \nturning to a consideration of the nature of subsistence activity and society within a number of \nother \u2018sub-optimal\u2019\/marginal regions within the Levant.  \nOne of the key issues to negotiate when interpreting the settlement patterns within the Homs \nbasalt is our ability to distinguish between a \u2018permanent\u2019 and \u2018semi-permanent\u2019 settltment \nwithin the archaeological record (e.g. Alizadeh 2008, 84). Research by Alizadeh within the \nhighlands of Iran has emphasized the potentially multi-faceted nature of many subsistence \nstrategies, with mobile pastoralist tribes relying on dry farming and taking advantage of \narable lands in both summer and winter pastures. In these cases members of the tribe often \nremain behind to harvest the crops, or alternatively local workers can be hired by the tribes to \ncarry out the harvesting (2008, 89). Studies in this region examining the Qashqaaii tribe have \nalso revealed that whilst this group practices vertical transhumance, they own villages, with \npermanent solid architecture, in both their summer and winter pasture areas (Alizadeh 2008, \n83). Clearly we cannot use this as a direct analogy to activity within the Homs basalt during \nthe 4th\u20133rd millennia BC, however it serves as a good example of how both agricultural and \npastoralist activities can be carried out by the same population group.  \nMoreover, as research by Simms (1988, 199) has highlighted, clear variation in settlement \nstability can be seen across groups, and also from year to year and season to season a \nvariability that clearly should not be underestimated in relation to the past. This variability \ncan also be seen to extend to the movement of livestock, with groups within a single \ndesignation of a tribal group moving in highly contrasting ways (Dyson-Hudson and Dyson-\nHudson 1980, 18). Despite this modern variation there are still a number of investigators who \ninterpret \u2018nomadic pastoralism\u2019 as a distinct cultural trajectory, occurring within the \nperiphery of the settled heartland (Rosen 1988, 499; Rosen 1997; Rosen 2002; Rosen 2008). \nIndeed, investigations within parts of the Negev, for example, do provide evidence for \nspecialist pastoralist subsistence activities from the end of the 6th millennium BC (Rosen \n2008, 120). Despite evidence for specialization, the degree to which groups can be classified \nas either \u2018pastoralists\u2019 or \u2018agriculturalists\u2019, especially given arguments for the close \ninteraction between the \u2018settled heartland\u2019 and \u2018marginal peripheries\u2019 (Rosen 2008, 123), is \ndebatable.  \nWhat is apparent is that the nature of pastoralist occupation and subsistence throughout \nhistory is likely to have differed greatly, varying across regions and between groups. \nMoreover, there is no evidence, especially within the Homs region, to suggest animal \nhusbandry activities within the 4th and 3rd millennium in this region were similar in either \norganization or scale to those of the 2nd millennium BC. As such, it is likely that the \ndevelopment of large settlements, such as Mari (e.g. Charpin and Durand 1986; Anbar 1991; \nMatthews 2002) and Ebla (e.g. Archi 1991; Mazzoni 1991), and their role as centres of \nconsumption and as major political entities, would have had a profound effect upon \npastoralist practices. Given the above variability of evidence, it is clear that interpretations \nwhich attempt to attribute a single phase of activity or morphology of settlement\/monuments \nto a single definable subsistence group are problematic.  \nOur analysis of settlement patterns within the Homs region has suggested that the contrasting \nlocation of tell and enclosure sites indicates that these sites were associated with different \ntypes of subsistence practice. On the basis of their location it has been suggested that whilst \nthe tell settlements were predominantly associated with cereal crops within the wadi bottoms, \nthe grouped structure sites were predominantly linked with seasonal grazing in areas away \nfrom the wadis at higher elevations. This would facilitate the exploitation of cereals and \nvegetables, some of which could be dried and stored for lean months. Animal products, such \nas milk, meat and yoghurt, could again be dried, stored and transported facilitating the \nadaptation and successful negotiation of dynamics of resource growth and decline. This is not \nto suggest, however, that we were dealing with different populations, trading and exchanging \ntheir goods and products. Instead, what is apparent from the shared material culture at both \ntell and enclosure sites, is that we are dealing with a continuum of activity by the same \npopulation who were adapting to and exploiting the Homs basalt during a period of \nheightened connectivity between \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 and fertile regions. With this in mind it is \nworth briefly considering the nature of subsistence and settlement activity within regions \noutside the NSA. \nC. Comparison with other \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 zones [B] \nThe Hauran [C] \nSuch a hypothesis has also been recently suggested in relation to the Hauran region, with \nBraemer and others arguing that a continuum of 4th\u20133rd millennium BC activity can be \nidentified within this region, centred around the main settlement of Khirbet al-Umbashi, \nwhich may have acted as central site for the gathering of different groups employed in \ndifferent aspects of subsistence (Braemer and Sapin 2001; Braemer and \u00c9challier et al. 2004). \nOf particular interest, in terms of local strategies, is the clear emphasis upon cattle raising at \nthe site of Umbashi (Braemer and \u00c9challier et al. 2004, 282\u201383). In contrast, the paucity of \nremains of wild species such as gazelle at the site (Braemer and \u00c9challier et al. 2004, 282), \ndespite the evidence for structures such as jellyfish and kites traditionally interpreted as \nrelating to hunting activities within the area (Braemer and \u00c9challier et al. 2004, 266\u201367), \nsuggests that Umbashi, rather than being related to hunting activities, was predominantly \nassociated with pastoral and agricultural activities (ibid., 282\u201383). The presence of cereal \ngrains from the southern sector of the site, which have been dated to Early Bronze Age (ibid., \n282) indicate that not only pastoralist activities were being undertaken in the region. \nMoreover, Schumacher in the 19th century referred to the area as wheat country, \u2018Belad el-\nKameh\u2019 (Schumacher 1886, 25). On the basis of the presence of evidence for both pastoral \nactivities and cereal production, it has been suggested by the investigators that pastoralists \nand agriculturalist may have been in competition for resources (ibid., 282\u201383). However, as \nsuggested in relation to the Homs region it may be that we are witnessing a period when both \npastoral and agricultural activities are being carried out by the same population group at \ndifferent times of year. \nIn contrast to Khirbet Umbashi, there is at present no evidence within the NSA for features, \nsuch as ramparts or obvious major centres. Instead, the settlement pattern is more dispersed. \nThis more widespread distribution of settlements may have been facilitated by the ubiquity of \nseasonal pools and wadis within this region, in contrast to the region around Umbashi, where \nmanagement of seasonal flow in the local wadi system provided the key to success (e.g. \nBraemer and \u00c9challier et al. 2004, 41). In the NSA, the one site which hints at some sort of \ncentral function is the enclosure SHR 362. However, SHR 362 apart, current evidence \nindicates that within the Homs basalts no dichotomy can be seen between those occupying \nthe tells and those utilizing the enclosures sites, thus a central site, such as represented by \nKhirbet al-Umbashi may not have been necessary\u2014or it may have been located outside the \nNSA. Indeed, we can hypothesize that the same population was using both tells and \nenclosures but possibly at different times of the year. From the above discussion it appears \nthat while complementary elements of subsistence, architecture and material culture can be \nfound in both the NSA and Umbashi region, the two areas display quite distinct local \ntrajectories, albeit with common elements in relation to wider developments occurring during \nthe 4th\u20133rd millennium BC. \nThe Jaulan [C] \nThe Jaulan is a further area, where similar forms of architecture and material culture to those \ndocumented within the NSA occur. Like the NSA, and in contrast to the Umbashi region, the \nJaulan Chalcolithic appears to be characterized by dispersed village based settlement, with no \nevidence for a centralized agglomeration of population (Epstein 1998, 6\u20138). Due to the humid \nand basaltic nature of the soil within the region, relatively little faunal or botanical evidence \nhas been recovered. Studies of the material from the Chalcolithic settlement sites investigated \nby Epstein have suggested the presence of a mixed economy based on the cultivation of \ngrains, pulses and olives in association with the grazing of caprines (Davis and Grigson 1998, \n341\u201342; Lipschitz et al. 1998, 339\u201340). \nHowever, the limited amount of material from the Chalcolithic period, when combined with \nour basic lack of knowledge of Bronze Age settlement patterns within the region, renders it \ndifficult to make general statements concerning subsistence practices during the 4th\u20133rd \nmillennium BC. Moreover, whilst the domestication of the olive is now dated to the \nChalcolithic (Meadows 2001; 2005; Lovell 2002b, 96; 2008, 742), the nature of olive \ncultivation during this period is less clear, and it remains uncertain whether widespread, \nlarge-scale cultivation of olives occurred within the Chalcolithic or the Early Bronze Age \n(e.g. Finkelstein and Gophna 1993, 11\u201313; Lovell 2002b, 97). The settlement architecture of \nthe Jaulan during the Chalcolithic is characterized by rectilinear structures (Epstein 1998, 8\u2013\n9), while little is known about settlement architecture in the succeeding Early Bronze Age, \nwith researchers having focused on the presence of cairn and dolmen monuments, which they \nhave generally linked to nomadic pastoralists (e.g. Epstein 1985; Zohar 1992). This is not the \nplace to debate the problems with simple associations between nomads and monuments, such \nas dolmens and cairns (for which see inter alia Prag [1995, 79]; Philip [2003; 2008, 194\u201395]). \nGiven the different dating of the comparative evidence in these areas, 5th\u20134th millennium BC \nin the Jaulan and 4th\u20133rd millennium BC in the NSA and Hauran, it is possible that some of \nthe differences between the regions might simply be chronological. However, Na\u2018aman \n(1951) makes no mention of olive cultivation in the NSA during the 19th\u201320th centuries AD, \nwhile the presence of olives and associated products within the archaeological record of the \nJaulan suggests that communities in the two regions drew upon a rather different set of \nsubsistence elements. Moreover, the presence in the Jaulan of large storage pithoi and basalt \nvessels, which are entirely absent from the Homs region, is indicative of a distinct regional \nadaption to the local \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 environment. Thus, the evidence from the Jaulan also \nindicates a regional and localized development, which cannot easily be fitted into a single \nsubsistence or cultural identity associated with either nomadic pastoralism or agriculture. \nThe Negev [C] \nDespite, its different geology, environmental attributes (Evenari et al. 1971, 51; Zohary 1973, \n46\u201348) and economic patterns (Rosen 2002, 755\u201356; Abadi-Reiss and Rosen 2008), the \nNegev provides perhaps the best architectural parallels for the enclosure sites of the Homs \nbasalt (compare Fig. 7 here with Haiman 1992, 32, fig. 8 and Haiman 1996, 7, fig. 4). \nInvestigation of sites within the Negev has revealed the presence of clusters of round and \nelliptical structures built using limestone, which range from around 5\u201310 m in diameter and \nhave been found associated with a range of cairn-type structures (Cohen and Dever 1978, 32\u2013\n33, Haiman 1994, 24\u201329). As in the Homs region, the round and elliptical structures occur in \nclusters ranging in number from around a dozen, up to densities of around 75 at sites such as \nBe\u2019er Resisim (Cohen and Dever 1978, 32\u201333). In contrast to the preliminary dates suggested \nfor the Homs NSA, excavation at the Negev sites has suggested that the remains \npredominantly date to the Early Bronze IV period (Cohen and Dever 1979, 253\u201354). \nHowever, as with the Homs region, interpreting the palimpsest of activity within this area \npresents a challenge.  \nIt is clear from the location of the majority of this region beyond the 150 mm isohyet \n(Evenari et al. 1971, 8\u20139), that subsistence opportunities within the area would have been \nprofoundly different from those afforded by the NSA of the Homs region. Indeed, it has been \nargued, in relation to the Negev, that subsistence, mining\/resource exploitation and trade \nactivities within this region during EB I\u2013II would have been impossible without the presence \nof the large settlement of Arad located to the north, at the transition between \u2018settled \nheartland\u2019 and \u2018marginal desert\u2019 (Rosen 2008, 123, but see Avner and Carmi 2001 and \nreferences therein for new dating, which may challenge this interpretation). The presence of \nstructures, such as those from Be\u2019er Resisim, which represent a combination of storage areas, \nanimal enclosures and human habitations, provide a useful strong analogy for similar remains \nfound at the enclosure sites in the NSA. However, given the evidence for strong inter-\nregional trade and activities, such as metal production and stone quarrying at certain sites \nwithin the region (e.g. Adams 2002, 24\u201325; Rosen 2002, 755\u201356; Abadi-Reiss and Rosen \n2008) it is apparent that populations during the 4th\u20133rd millennium BC were utilizing the \nresources within the Negev in a wide variety of ways. In short, the Negev provides yet \nanother example of the population of a \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 region adapting and exploiting the \nwider connectivity developing during the 4th\u20133rd millennium BC, but in a manner that \nreflects local affordances and connections. Moreover, when compared to the NSA, it offers \nan important example of how similar material culture signatures may relate to rather different \ninteractions between animals, humans and the environment. \nThis brief overview of current evidence from neighbouring \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 regions has been \ndesigned to underscore the fact that despite some formal similarities in the archaeological \nrecord and in environmental possibilities between the Homs basalts, the Hauran, the Jaulan \nand the Negev, no single solution to the exploitation of \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 landscapes was \nadopted. Rather, we appear to be witnessing a period that saw more intensive exploitation of \nsuch zones by human groups, but in which solutions were developed that were appropriate to \neach specific case. Thus, whilst development in these regions may have been initially \nfacilitated by processes of heightened \u2018connectivity\u2019, an awareness of new economic \nopportunities, perhaps arising from quite distant developments, and also by the growth of \nlarger communities within lowland basins, it is clear that populations in the \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 \nregions were embracing new possibilities selectively, and adopting only those which allowed \nthe potential of the particular regions to be realized. \n7. The way ahead [A] \nIn the foregoing account we have sought to make clear the nature of the archaeological record \nthat is to be associated with Chalcolithic and EBA activity in the basalt landscape west of the \nOrontes River, near modern Homs. This is an important step towards understanding the \narchaeological record in an area of Syria typical of those regions outside the main river \nbasins, and where mud brick construction and large tells are not to be expected. This we have \ndone by establishing criteria which permit a clear distinction to be drawn between remains \nrelating to the Graeco-Roman period or later, and those which pertain to earlier activity. By \ndoing so we have been able both to highlight the unobtrusive nature of the latter, and the key \nrole played by satellite imagery in prospection for archaeological remains of this kind. We \nhave also sought to make apparent the severity of the threat that it now faces. We now hope \nthat researchers will seek to re-evaluate the nature of the evidence for pre-Classical activity in \nother \u2018upland\u2019 zones, and thus improve our understanding of the wider context within which \nthe familiar tell landscapes were situated. \nHaving identified the archaeology of the Chalco-EB, we have then sought to suggest the \nprobable nature of the activities with which such remains might have been associated. This \nwe have done through a combination of ethnographic accounts, with a locational analysis of \nthe different categories of archaeological remains. The resulting analysis views the small \nvalley bottom tells, the upland cairns and enclosures, and the enigmatic circular enclosure of \nSHR 362, as forming part of a coherent landscape, for which a date in the 4th or earlier 3rd \nmillennia BC is indicated by the associated material evidence.  \nHaving outlined the nature of this occupation, we argue that this phenomenon is distinct both \nspatially and chronologically from the now well-documented expansion of settlement into the \nsteppe margins during the EB IV period. Rather, we argue that the process detectable in the \nHoms basalt relates to an earlier phase of activity, and is but one element in a region-wide, \nbut locally quite distinct, expansion of human activity into regions that had hitherto been \nregarded as of limited interest, but which are of considerable value when managed \nappropriately. This we attribute to both push and pull factors. The latter are mostly orientated \naround changes in the demand for material goods arising from region-wide socio-political \ndevelopments. The former embrace a range of new \u2018things\u2019, in particular products arising \nfrom a coming together of new technologies and new forms of animal and crop management. \nSome of these, including woollen textiles and olive oil in particular, are likely to have \nimpacted upon the perceived value of different tracts of land, and thus to have reshaped the \nway in which local populations engaged with, valued, and in due course would inscribe \nthemselves upon, the landscape.  \nA growing body of evidence suggests that that \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 zones across a wide swathe of \nthe Middle East made a significant contribution to the development of regional economies \nduring the 4th and 3rd millennia. In fact, resources extracted from these areas may have been \nan important element in facilitating the expansion of settlement that has been identified in a \nnumber of regions\u2014mainly lowland tell-landscapes. While there is more that could be said, \nin the absence of excavation data, and in particular reliable radiometric, artefactual and \nenvironmental evidence, we are reluctant to take analysis further at the present time. Given \nthe scale of the threat to this particular aspect of the regional archaeological record, and the \npotential it offers to shed light on developments across the region, it should be a very high \npriority indeed for excavation. \n[hdg]Acknowledgements \n \nThe authors wish to express our thanks to the British Academy and the Leverhulme Trust \nwho have provided financial support for fieldwork and data analysis respectively. The \nauthors gratefully acknowledge the support of the offices of the Directorate General of \nAntiquities and Museums in Damascus and in Homs, and in particular that of Dr Michel al-\nMaqdissi, Director of Excavations. Thanks are also due to Dr Paul Newson and Dr Maamoun \nAbdulkarim, who undertook initial fieldwork in the basalt landscape in the earlier years of the \nproject, and whose acute observations have proved invaluable. For advice on the ceramic and \nlithic finds we are indebted to Dr Anne Pirie and Dr Stephen Bourke.  \nThe results published here would have been impossible without the support of our hard-\nworking field teams. The individuals concerned were: 2007 Mr Ibrahim Musa (DGAM, \nHoms); 2008 Mr Arthur Anderson, Dr Robert Dunford, Mr Baha Khluf (DGAM, Homs), Ms \nKristen Hopper, Mr Abdul Khadir (DGAM, Homs), Dr Matthew Whincop, Mr Thomas \nWhite; 2009 Ms Maryam Bshesh (DGAM, Homs), Ms Mhairi Campbell, Ms Lucia Khabdaz \n(DGAM, Homs), Mr Abdul Khadir (DGAM, Homs), Mr Dan Lawrence, Dr Keith Wilkinson \nand Mr Abdul Khadir (DGAM, Homs).  \n[hdg] Bibliography \nAbadi-Reiss, Y. and Rosen, S.
