And\nhaving briefly heard Clinton play, I would say we are at roughly the same acceptable, though\nunmistakably amateur, standard. Nevertheless, we are no doubt both so attuned to the sound\nof the saxophone that it would not be easy to fool either of us into believing that a real\ninstrument is being played if in reality the sound of the instrument had been electronically\nsynthesized. Certain instruments are easier to synthesize than others. For instance, it is hard\neven for sensitive ears to distinguish between a genuine church organ and a church-organ\nsound coming out of a good synthesizer. This is partly because the sound quality of the organ\nis not dependent on the organist: a two-year-old child who presses an organ key achieves no\nbetter or worse sound quality with that key than the most gifted organist. On the other hand, a\nsynthesized solo saxophone (like most synthesized instruments) tends to have a certain\nunnatural, mechanical quality which is difficult to pin-point but which to the saxophonist\nimmediately rings false. It was therefore with astonishment that I recently listened to two solo\nsaxophone pieces, one played on a real tenor saxophone by a top-flight jazz saxophonist, the\nother the result of some keyboard input and clever programming by computer scientists who\nmay well have had only a rudimentary knowledge of music and perhaps no playing skills\nwhatsoever. I was quite unable to say which of the two was synthesized even after repeated\nlistenings. The fact is that the perceived perfection achieved by a professional saxophonist is\nnot perfection at all but an amalgam of skill, flexible reactions and numerous little human\nerrors, and provided that this skill, these reactions and these errors can be identified and\nquantified - clearly, they can - they can all be coded so that the result is perceived perfection.\nIn short, perceived perfection in instrumental synthesis seems to be merely a matter of how\nlong a programmer is willing to spend on fine-tuning the program code.\nCan the same sort of thing be applied to the sole use of educational technology as opposed to\nusing human teachers? The problem for educational technologists writing CAL programs is\none of producing a level of flexible reaction and interaction equal to that which an experienced\nhuman teacher can offer. Is it thus only a matter of the amount of care and effort put into the\nprogramming? Can a brilliant, patient programmer, drawing on the expertise of brilliant\nhuman teachers, produce the software equivalent of a brilliant human teacher? If not, might\nthis be possible in the foreseeable future?\nThe answer to all these questions is - I would have thought obviously - No, except within\ncertain categories of training software involving repetitive tasks and\/or motor skills (and even\nthen . . . ) . Of course, there is hardly an educationist who will not add when theorizing about\nthe use of technology that a human teacher will always be necessary, but I often get the feeling\nwhen reading academic papers concerned with the theory of learning technology that remarks\nabout the need for human intervention are there either as comforters or safety nets to catch\nthe crystal ball if it eventually has to be discarded as junk. Indeed, I detect among many\nacademics writing about software for use in education a deeply held belief that technology will\nsoon reach - in certain cases, has already reached - a stage at which the human teacher can be\ndispensed with. Yet the number of potential variables in most teacher-learner situations is\nvastly greater than the number of variables involved in accurately reproducing the sound of a\nmusical instrument - so great, in fact, that even imagining the technology of 10, 20 or more\nyears from now, it is hard if not impossible to envisage a teaching machine so advanced that it\ncould entirely replace a human being for all but those learning situations where understanding\nconcepts is of secondary importance. Medical diagnosis entirely by computer, pilotless\n2\nAlt J Volume 2 Number 2\npassenger jets, robots that do the housework . . . all are conceivable within the lifetime of\ntoday's young people. But despite the uncanny accuracy of some of Arthur C. Clarke's\npredictions of thirty or so years ago in 2001: A Space Odyssey, the chances of our producing\nby the beginning of the 21st century (or even well beyond) a computer like HAL, able to react\nmore or less like a human being, are inflnitesimally small; and it would take a HAL to make\nhuman teachers completely redundant. It is always dangerous to predict the pace of\ntechnological progress, but the teacher-student relationship is potentially so complex that\nencompassing all possible subtleties of it in a teaching machine seems as out of reach as a\nmanned mission to the nearest star or accurately forecasting next week's weather.\nTwo things flow from this. The first has become almost a cliche: that human teachers who fear\nredundancy because of educational technology are needlessly concerned. In the 1960s, the\nlanguage laboratory appeared to many language teachers as a threat to jobs, when in fact\nthere was no more possibility of their being replaced by a tape recorder than there is now by a\ncomputer. The second is that we must always approach with a degree of healthy\ncircumspection the value of educational software in the comparatively inflexible form it has\nnow and will certainly have for a long time to come.\nIn the 1950s, the behaviourist psychologist B.F. Skinner believed that the teaching machine\nhad such obvious advantages - infinite patience, consistent reaction to student input, the offer\nof self-paced learning, the fascination of youth with technology and so on - that any\ndisadvantages were far outweighed, and this at a time when teaching machines were\nrudimentary and cumbersome affairs by modern standards. Skinner's ideas about\nprogrammed learning were later toppled from first place in the educational popularity league\nby Bruner and other advocates of discovery-based learning; but again, with the advent of\nhypertext and hypermedia encouraging browsing and guesswork, the by now more\nmanageable teaching machine still fitted nicely into the scheme of things. Today, if anything,\nthe pendulum is swinging back to the apparent security of the step-by-step approach, though\nneural networks look set to prolong the popularity of hypermedia as a discovery-based\nlearning tool. The teaching machine will thus doubtless continue to be promoted, if only to\nrelieve pressure on teachers faced with ever larger numbers of students.\nIt is right to promote it, but we should also continually re-assess the extent to which it can\nsuccessfully be used in the absence of a human teacher. In my view, it can very successfully be\nused, provided that two basic conditions are met. The first is that human teachers are fully\naware of the dangers of non-intervention in the teaching environment. The second is that both\nteachers and students are fully aware of the limitations of CAL software, and therefore\nprepared to question computer-generated responses and assessments. A computer program is\nthe result of decisions initially made by human beings, and it is human not only to err, but also\nto be so unimaginably complex that no machine yet designed can come anywhere near an\nacceptable synthesis of the way our minds work. Those of us involved in educational\ntechnology should therefore be blowing our own trumpets but not before having pushed some\nmutes into their bells.\nWhat I say here is not new. But I believe it is certainly worth repeating.\nGabriel Jacobs\n3\n"}
