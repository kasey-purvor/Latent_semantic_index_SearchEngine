The resultant definition which, it is \nsuggested, could form the basis for a European Magna Charta Libertatis Academicae, goes \nbeyond traditional discussions of academic freedom by specifying not only the rights inherent \nin the concept but also its accompanying duties, necessary limitations and safeguards. The \npaper concludes with proposals for how the definition might be tested and carried forward. \nKEYWORDS: academic freedom; European Union; working definition. \n \n \nIntroduction \nThis paper\u2019s purpose is to provide a working definition of academic freedom for the higher \neducation institutions of the European Union. The paper\u2019s rationale is as follows. Firstly, \nacademic freedom is considered a fundamental aspect of the workings of Universities in the \nEuropean Union. For example, the Magna Charta Universitatum declaims: \u2018Freedom in \nresearch and training is the fundamental principle of university life, and governments and \nuniversities, each as far as in them lies, must ensure respect for this fundamental requirement\u2019 \n(EUA, 1988, 1).  Similarly, the proposed European Union Constitution explicitly states in \nArticle II-73 that \u2018[t]he arts and scientific research shall be free of constraint. Academic \nfreedom shall be respected\u2019 (E.U., 2005, 50). The Constitution received insufficient support \namong the E.U. nations to be enacted into law. However, if the process of integration among \np.1 \nthe 27 (and more) member states is to proceed, a document of similar status is likely to be \nratified within the next decade. For such a document to have a meaningful impact in ensuring \nthat academic freedom is nurtured and protected, academic freedom needs to be defined. \nTherefore a second rationale is that it is difficult to argue coherently for the importance of \nacademic freedom when it is ill-defined. Hence Jasper (1990, 451) states \u2018[o]ne of the primary \nreasons for the difficulty in protecting academic freedom is that the academic community has \nagreed upon no single definition of the term\u2019. Similarly, as Felt (2002, 15) has recognised, \n\u2018[e]ven though we would very quickly agree on the importance of \u201cacademic freedom\u201d for the \ndevelopment of contemporary societies, the meaning of this notion remains extremely vague\u2019, \nand even when academic freedom is discussed, as Gerber (2001, 23) relates, \u2018[t]oo often, \nhowever, references to academic freedom in public discourse are formulaic or disingenuous \nand fail to take in to account the full meaning of the concept\u2019. Hence, because of its presumed \nimportance, Altbach (2001, 217) argues that \u2018[a]cademic freedom needs a universal definition \n. . . (as) the lack of agreement on the nature of academic freedom makes a common \nunderstanding and unified action difficult\u2019. \nThe final rationale is that Karran\u2019s (2007) analysis of the legal protection for academic \nfreedom within the E.U. nations revealed sufficient commonalities to demonstrate that a \nunified definition is possible, but indicated that the level of academic freedom in some states \nwas markedly lower than in others. For the process of integration among the European Union \nstates to proceed, it is necessary to assess the comparative differences between the nations, \nand previous empirical research has identified these dissimilarities with respect to academic \nfreedom. Once this is done, benchmarks can be established based on best and most common \npractice \u2013 for example, under Austrian law no member of a university can be required to \nparticipate in academic work which conflicts with his\/her conscience, and such legislation \nwould produce net benefits for academic freedom if applied across Europe. From such \nbenchmarks appropriate policy mechanisms can be developed, which allocate suitable \nresources to the individual nations in accordance with the comparative differences identified, \nto enable all states to reach a similar level of provision. Hence a working definition of \nacademic freedom for the E.U. is an essential step in the development of such policy \ninstruments, to facilitate greater integration of the higher education systems of the European \nUnion nations and the creation of the European Higher Education Learning Space. \n \np.2 \nWhat is Academic Freedom? \nNot surprisingly, academics agree that \u2018[a]cademic freedom is of unquestioned importance\u2019 \n(Stuller, 1998, 342). For example, Turner (1988, 107) considers that \u2018[a]cademic freedom is \nnot therefore some arcane and anachronistic privilege. \u2026 It is the simple and basic condition \nfor the job\u2019. Similarly Menand (1996, 4) states that academic freedom \u2018is the key legitimating \nconcept of the entire enterprise\u2019. In consequence of this interest, as Cameron (1996, 1) has \nnoted, \u2018[t]he literature on academic freedom is voluminous\u2019. For example, the bibliographic \nanalysis by Sinder (1990) that lists over 170 articles, many of which seek definitional clarity \nbecause \u2018[b]efore one can defend academic freedom, however, it must be defined\u2019 (Rajagopal, \n2003, 25). Given such academic industriousness, \u00c5kerlind and Kayrooz\u2019s (2003, 328) opinion \nthat, \u2018[d]espite the wide ranging debate about academic freedom in recent times, there is little \nconsensus between parties as to what academic freedom actually means. \u2026 the concept is \nopen to a range of interpretations and has been used at times to support conflicting causes and \npositions\u2019, is therefore surprising. However this view is widely shared. For example, from \nBenson\u2019s perspective \u2018[a] precise definition of academic freedom has yet to be articulated\u2019 \n(Benson, 1983, 679), while according to Olivas (1992, 1835) \u2018[a]cademic freedom \u2026is poorly \nunderstood and ill-defined\u2019, an opinion shared by Neave (2002, 332), who reports that \u2018a \nsingle interpretation of Academic Freedom is very far from being shared\u2019. \nHence \u2018[a]cademic freedom seems a simple concept, and in essence it is, but it is also \ndifficult to define\u2019 (Altbach, 2001, 206) and \u2018[t]he term is certainly not a self-defining one \nand can also be a source of considerable contention and even litigation\u2019 (Schmeltekoph, 2000, \n1). Some of this contention is due to the predilection for argumentation among academics \n(especially when considering a principle crucial to their profession), some of whom believe \nthat attempts to define academic freedom may be ill-judged. For example, Scott (1996, 177) \nsuggests that \u2018[a]cademic freedom can never be boiled down to an essence: it is instead an \nethical practice aimed not at the protection of individuals, but at the advancement of our \ncollective well-being\u2019. Similarly, Tierney (2001, 12) describes academic life as \u2018nuanced and \ncomplex (such that) one ought not to define academic freedom solely by the presence or \nabsence of overt interference\u2019. Further, Menand (1996, 5) refers to the \u2018more deeply \nmisleading assumption \u2026 that there exists some unproblematic conception of academic \nfreedom that is philosophically coherent and that will conduce to outcomes in particular cases \nwhich all parties will feel to be just and equitable\u2019. \np.3 \nPart of the problem lies in the fact that, as Russell (1993, 1) relates, \u2018[t]he words \n\u201cacademic freedom\u201d have often caused confusion because they come from a medieval \nintellectual tradition which pre-dates most of the current meanings of the word \u201cfreedom\u201d\u2019. \nHowever, academics have a vested interest in resisting definitional clarity, as when the limits \nof academic freedom are imprecise it is more difficult for those accused of infringing \nacademic freedom to demonstrate their innocence. As Schmitt (1975, 113) points out, the \nacademic freedom campaign was very successful because \u2018politicians have become very wary \nof being labelled enemies of freedom for attacking academics. . . . The confusions \nsurrounding the concept of academic freedom . . . have been extremely helpful in this \ncampaign\u2019. Moreover, Manan (2000, 255) argues, \u2018there are professors who used academic \nfreedom as a weapon to defend themselves from their performance being evaluated by the \nacademic community\u2019. Indeed, the degree of elasticity applied to the principle by academics \nhas been inventive, if unpersuasive \u2013 Rabban (1987, 1410), for example, reports that while he \nwas the AAUP\u2019s legal counsel \u2018several professors of medicine asserted that universities had \nviolated their academic freedom by limiting their clinical income to 100,000 dollars\u2019. \nOne of the major problems with academic freedom is that, as Van Alstyne (1975, 71) \nnotes, \u2018[a]cademic freedom is a \u201cfreedom\u201d (i.e., a liberty marked by the absence of restraints \nor threats against its exercise) rather than a \u201cright\u201d (i.e., an enforceable claim upon the assets \nof others)\u2019. Consequently, \u2018[a]cademic freedom is most often defined by a violation or an \nabridgment of a particular right. In other words, academic freedom is often defined by its \nabsence\u2019 (Tierney, 2001, 8). Hence, academics in the United States have resorted to legal \nredress when their academic freedom has been violated.  Although the US Supreme Court has \nupheld the right of academic freedom, Byrne (1989, 257) notes that it \u2018has been far more \ngenerous in its praise of academic freedom than in providing a precise analysis of its \nmeaning\u2019, such that Lynch (2003, 1066) argues \u2018[a]lthough many courts and commentators \nsimply refer to \u201cacademic freedom\u201d, proper analysis requires further specification of what \ntype of academic freedom is being referenced\u2019. \nHowever US legal rulings have not attempted to define academic freedom, but instead \npass opinion on whether it has been infringed. Consequently, as Byrne (1989, 253) \ngraphically describes, \u2018[l]acking definition or guiding principle, the doctrine floats in law, \npicking up decisions as a hull does barnacles\u2019. Hence Byrne (2001, 583) argues that academic \nfreedom \u2018lacks a canonical definition. It primarily is a creation of academics themselves in \narticulating the normative basis of modern scholarship and teaching. Only derivatively is \nacademic freedom a legal concept.\u2019 Most analyses of academic freedom in America relate to \np.4 \nits protection under the free speech amendments of the US Constitution. Unlike the US \nConstitution, the proposed European Union constitution categorically states that \u2018[a]cademic \nfreedom shall be respected\u2019 (E.U., 2005, 50), but provides no further guidance, suggesting \nthat if the constitution was adopted in this form, the legal wrangles over the definition of \nacademic freedom, evident in the USA, could occur in Europe. \nAs Goldstein (1976, 1293) states, \u2018the modern development of the doctrine of academic \nfreedom is largely derived from the nineteenth century German concepts of Lehrfreiheit and \nLernfreiheit\u2019 which are associated with the reforms instituted by Wilhelm von Humboldt at \nBerlin University. Ash\u2019s analysis (2006) challenges the centrality of Humboldt\u2019s contribution \nwhich, he argues, has acquired a mythical status at variance with historical fact. However, as \nNybom (2003, pp.144,141) points out, although \u2018[t]he intellectual core and institutional \nrational of the Humboldtian university concept rested on \u2026 ideological building blocks which \nwere \u2026integral dimensions of German idealistic philosophy, and, consequently, not Wilhelm \nvon Humboldt\u2019s own original intellectual inventions,\u2019 nevertheless the Humboldtian ideal \nneeds to be addressed because of \u2018its continued presence in almost every European discussion \non the mission and future of higher education and research\u2019. Moreover, the Humboldtian \nmodel had an equally profound impact in the USA. In 1876, Johns Hopkins was founded as \nthe first American university offering graduate education on the German model. As White \n(2000, 59) reports: \u2018[o]f the fifty-three Hopkins faculty members when the university was first \nestablished, nearly all had studied at German universities. They adopted the German method \nof instruction, relying on lectures, seminars, and laboratories\u2019. Such was the German \ninfluence on Hopkins that, as Hofstadter and Metzger (1955, 377) note: \u2018[a]ptly was this \nuniversity called the G\u00f6ttingen at Baltimore\u2019, and Johns Hopkins became the model for the \nmodern American research university. \nA central aspect of the Humboldtian model was the unity of teaching and research, \n(Einheit von Lehre und Forschung) and the collaborative pursuit of these by staff and \nstudents. Hence Von Humboldt (1970, 242f) considered that universities have \u2018as their task \nthe cultivation of science and scholarship in the deepest and broadest sense,\u2019 in which \n\u2018[c]ollaboration operates through a process in which the successful intellectual achievements \nof one person arouse the intellectual passions and enthusiasms of others, and through the fact \nthat what was at first expressed only by one individual becomes a common intellectual \npossession instead of fading away in isolation.\u2019 In this process \u2018both teacher and student have \ntheir justification in the common pursuit of knowledge\u2019 and hence \u2018the goals of science and \nscholarship are worked towards most effectively through the synthesis of the teacher's and the \np.5 \nstudents' dispositions\u2019. Hence as Lay (2004, 48) observes \u2018[t]eaching was to be a means of \nimproving both lecturer and student: true knowledge would emerge in the interplay between \nexperience and enthusiasm\u2019. \nThe Humboldtian model of academic freedom, still resonates, albeit muted, within the \nuniversities of the European Union. Thus, in 1988 430 University Rectors signed the Magna \nCharta Universitatum, which proclaimed adherence to the Humboldtian principle that \n\u2018[t]eaching and research in universities must be inseparable\u2019 (EUA, 1998, 1). Despite \nacknowledging the importance of academic freedom, the Magna Charta Observatory has yet \nto provide a workable definition of the concept. Work by the International Universities \nAssociation led to a \u2018Recommendation Concerning the Status of Higher Education Teaching \nPersonnel\u2019, which was adopted by UNESCO in 1997. The UNESCO (1997) document is \ncomprehensive but has limited utility as the basis for a Magna Charta Libertatis Academicae, \nor in determining the day to day applicability or repudiation of academic freedom. \nAcademic Freedom: A Working Definition for the European Union \nThere is a danger that any definition will be developed as a lowest common denominator, and \ncast broad enough to encompass the majority of existing practices in E.U. states. However, for \nacademic freedom to possess more than mere ornamental significance in Europe\u2019s \nUniversities, \u2018the particulars of the concept of academic freedom must be carefully defined; it \nis not a liberty arbitrarily granted\u2019 (Rochford, 2003, 250). However, one must acknowledge \nthat minor variations in university teaching and research occur within and between \nuniversities and nation states, which may impact on academic freedom.  For example, the \ndominant university model in Europe is the state funded secular institution but there are both \nreligious and private (non-denominational) universities in the E.U., which operate in a slightly \ndifferent fashion.  In Spain, for example, both private non-denominational and \ndenominational universities exist, however, as Embid (1999, 100) explains all \u2018Private \nUniversity recognition Acts refer to the need for a University\u2019s organizational and functional \nrules to \u201crespect and guarantee, fully and effectively, the principle of educational freedom \nwhich is shown in academic freedom, freedom of research and freedom of study.\u201d\u2019  \nDespite such minor exceptions, the longevity of universities and the universality of their \nstructures, (Faculties, Departments), practices (lectures, seminars, theses, etc.) and personnel \n(Rectors, Professors, Lecturers) are such that a definition of academic freedom (and more \nsignificantly, its limitations) should be possible. Moreover, with some justification, Barnett \n(1990, 137) has argued that: \u2018[t]he traditional discussions of academic freedom, \u2026 are also \np.6 \ndepressingly uniform. They frequently exhibit the following characteristics: a lack of \nspecificity; a concern for the academic freedom of staff not students; a defensive proclamation \nof the rights of academics; and a disinclination to say anything about the duties that should \naccompany academics' rights\u2019. Hence in attempting a definition, rather than trying to find a \nconclusive epistemological needle in a philosophical haystack, the concern is to provide a \npreliminary generic statement that is sharp enough with which to sew together the essential \nelements of the concept, and make them readily explicable, thereby addressing the \ndeficiencies identified by Barnett. Therefore the following is offered as a preliminary \nfoundation for this definitional process, and a stimulus to debate \nThe literature on academic freedom concentrates on extolling its desirability, and not \ndefining its limits or accompanying duties. However, as Kennedy (2003, 2) points out: \n\u2018[a]cademic freedom has a counterpart, academic duty, that is much more seldom used\u2019. \nMoreover, as Bollinger (2005, 20) points out: \u2018[w]e should not accept the argument that our \nprofessional norms cannot be defined, and that transgressions thus must be accepted without \nconsequences. \u2026 it will not do simply to say that professional standards are too vague for any \nenforcement\u2019. Consequently, this paper tries to remedy this by clarifying these limits and \nduties in greater depth than previous analyses. Hence, as Machlup (1955, 753) states: \u2018If \nfreedom in general is defined as the absence of, or protection from, restraints and \ninterferences, the definition of a particular kind of freedom will have to specify whose \nprotection from whose interferences of what sort and with what kind of activity it refers to\u2019. \nSome limitations on academic freedom derive from national legal frameworks, others from \ncodes of conduct regarding professional duties, emanating from the weft and warp of \nacademic life. Braxton and Bayer (1999), noting the dearth of empirical research into the \nnorms of university staff, gathered data from circa 1000 respondents, working in a variety of \ninstitutions.  Seven norms were derived from this data which \u2018are inviolable because of the \nextreme severity of the sanctions believed to fit transgressions of such norms\u2019 (p. 21), more \nspecifically, tenure removal. Braxton and Bayer accept that their list of norms is not \nexhaustive, but argue that, on the basis of their sample size, \u2018the range of incidents . . . likely \nrepresent the full spectrum of improprieties that might be uncovered\u2019 (op. cit, 15). \nRabban (2001, 17) points out that academic freedom, has been used to denote \u2018both the \nfreedom of the academy to pursue its ends without interference from the government . . . and \nthe freedom of the individual teacher (or in some versions - indeed in most cases - the \nstudent)\u2019. Consequently Warnock (1992, 120) argues, it is necessary to distinguish \u2018autonomy \nfrom academic freedom. . . . A great deal of confusion has been generated in recent years by a \np.7 \nfailure to make this distinction\u2019. Wolff\u2019s study makes this distinction explicit viz. \u2018[a]cademic \nfreedom is the privilege individual academics may claim as the freedom to question and test \nreceived wisdom, to put forward new ideas and controversial or unpopular opinions without \nplacing themselves in jeopardy of losing the jobs or privileges they may have at their \ninstitutions. Academic autonomy applies to the institution. It may be defined as the right of \nacademic institutions to decide freely and independently how to perform their tasks\u2019 (Wolff, \n2000, 198). Hence to avoid confusion, the following definition refers to freedom for \nindividuals within the academy, rather than the freedom of the academy within society, to \nwhich the description academic freedom is oft-times applied, but which refers to institutional \nautonomy (for a fuller discussion, see Finkin 1983, and Hiers 2002). \nSimilarly, freedom of speech and academic freedom need to be distinguished for, as \nOlivas (1993, 1838) rightly points out, \u2018[t]he concepts of free speech and academic freedom \nare symmetrical and overlapping, not synonymous\u2019.  In the majority of EU states, the \ndistinction between freedom of speech and academic freedom is recognised in law, with the \nformer being protected as a basic constitutional right, while the latter is given separate \nprotection either elsewhere in the constitution or within specific legislation on higher \neducation.  Hence this situation is different from that in the United States, where academic \nfreedom is protected derivatively, rather than directly, under the First Amendment to the \nConstitution which protects freedom of speech.  Consequently, as Van Alsytne (1975, 62) \nnotes  in the USA \u2018the phrase (academic freedom) slipped away from a close association with \nprotection of the academic in his professional endeavours and assumed a new synonymy with \nthe general civil liberties of academics.\u2019 However, academic freedom is more narrow in focus \nthan freedom of speech and, moreover, unlike freedom of speech, is granted to the few rather \nthan the many.  Freedom of speech is a generic activity freedom granted to all who speak and \nconstitutes the absence of constraint on utterances performed for no particular purpose or \neffect. By contrast, academic freedom is a specific personal freedom granted only to those \nwho \u2018perform academic actions.  Academic actions are teaching, research and the publication \nof the results of research and reflection\u2019 (Shils, 1995, 6), so that these actions can be \nsuccessfully undertaken. \nAcademic freedom is granted to academic (non-administrative) teaching and research \nstaff in Universities to enable them to undertake their teaching and research activities to the \nhighest possible professional standards. It comprises the following elements. \np.8 \nTeaching \nIn undertaking their teaching, academic freedom is granted to individual academic staff to \ndetermine: \n(1) The subject curriculum and how it is taught. In exercising this freedom, staff must ensure \nthat, as agreed by their academic peers and relevant academic associations and \nprofessional bodies, the subject content and the method of teaching: \n(A) are appropriate for, and relevant to, the subject and level (undergraduate, master, \ndoctoral) at which the course is set and are therefore comparable with (but not \nnecessarily identical to) the content and mode of instruction for similar qualifications \nat other comparable institutions, and are made known to the students prior to \ncommencement of the course. Any deviations from the course, in respect to the \ncontent and method of tuition, must be made known to the students in good time, and \nthe reasons for them reported fully; \n(B) accurately and impartially reflect current thinking, recent research and balanced \nopinion within their subject disciplines and are taught in a mode appropriate to their \nsubject discipline; \n(C) are such that they do not introduce any element of positive or negative bias, \ndistortion, misrepresentation or deliberate omission within the content and mode of \ndelivery or make derogatory, stigmatising or irrelevant, oral or written statements (or \nnonverbal symbols) in respect to (inter alia) age, economic status, ethnicity, gender, \nlanguage, marital status, nationality, personality, political belief, physical \nappearance, physical or mental disablement, race, religion, sexual orientation, social \nstatus, wealth, etc., unless these relate directly to the subject matter. For example, \nstatements about government military policy would be impermissible during a \ngeology lecture but gender studies\u2019 courses might justifiably include the examination \nof derogatory statements made about men or women. However, statements about the \nphysical appearance of a particular student or member of staff would never be \nacceptable. \n(2) Who shall be allowed to teach. In exercising this freedom, staff must ensure that: \n(A) persons employed to teach are appointed via an open, well documented and \ntransparent selection process (as outlined in the section on tenure), solely on the basis \nof their teaching and research excellence, expertise and experience and are not \nsubject to any discrimination on the basis of the factors identified in (1) (C). \np.9 \n(B) notwithstanding point (2) (A), where required by national or state legislation, \nacademic staff may exercise affirmative action to secure employment from groups \nunder-represented in university teaching positions, but this must be undertaken \nstrictly in adherence with the relevant legislation and recorded as such. Such \ntemporary measures must be discontinued when the objectives of equality of \nopportunity and treatment are achieved. \n(3) Who shall be allowed to study. In exercising this freedom, staff must ensure that: \n(A) students are chosen solely on the basis of their academic abilities, via an open, well \ndocumented and transparent selection process, and without discrimination on the \nbasis of any other irrelevant criteria [as identified in (1) (C), above]. \n(B) notwithstanding point (3) (A), where required by national or state legislation, \nacademic staff may exercise affirmative action to secure entry for students from \ngroups normally under-represented in higher education, but this must be undertaken \nstrictly in adherence with the relevant legislation and recorded as such. Such \ntemporary measures must be discontinued when the objectives of equality of \nopportunity and treatment are achieved. \n(4) How students\u2019 achievements shall be assessed and graded. In exercising this freedom, \nindividually and collectively, academic staff must ensure that, as agreed by their \nacademic peers and relevant academic associations and professional bodies: \n(A) the methods of assessment and of calculating grades are appropriate for the subject \ncurriculum and level (undergraduate, master, doctoral) at which the course is set and \nare comparable with those used for similar qualifications at other comparable \ninstitutions, and are made known to the students at the commencement of the course. \nAny deviations to the assessment mode during the course, must be made known to \nthe students in good time, and the reasons for them reported fully; \n(B) the assessment marks and grades awarded relate directly to the academic ability of \nstudents, as demonstrated via their performance of assessment tasks, and without \nreference to any other irrelevant criteria [as identified in (1) (C), above]. To avoid \nimplicit or explicit bias in assessment and grading, the university should attempt to \nanonymise the assessment and grading processes and institute a system of double \nblind marking; \n(C) students are provided with concise and timely feedback on assessment performance \nand grades, which enables a full understanding of the rationale for the grade \nawarded; \np.10 \n(D) a national or institutional system of quality assurance exists whereby external \nexaminers, qualified in the subject, can evaluate the assessment and grading systems \nto ensure that, in accordance with national and subject specific norms, they are \nappropriate, relevant, accurately, consistently and fairly applied, and free from bias; \n(E) institutional and external appeals systems exist, whereby students can seek a second \nopinion on a grade awarded, if they believe that the grade awarded does not \naccurately reflect the standard of their work, in respect to a specific assessment task. \n(5) Whether they are speaking in their capacity as a teacher or a citizen. Academic freedom \nis freedom of speech given for expert utterance within the university, in pursuit of \nteaching and research excellence. Hence, faculty staff engaging in extra-mural utterances \nare not protected by academic freedom, but enjoy all other constitutional and legal \nfreedoms afforded to the population at large. Moreover, in making utterances as private \ncitizens, faculty staff must make it explicit that they are neither speaking nor acting for \ntheir institutions. Similarly, utterances made on campus which are outside the academics\u2019 \nstated areas of expertise (for example, their beliefs on religion or politics), or made \noutside a formal academic setting, are protected by generic rights of free speech, but not \nby academic freedom, and faculty making such utterances have a responsibility to \ndistinguish when their objective is advocacy rather than academic excellence. \nFurthermore, on-campus utterances, undertaken by external invited speakers, as part of \nthe process of formal scholarly debate, have the protection of academic freedom, and the \nright to be heard. \nResearch \nIn undertaking research, academic freedom is granted to academic staff to determine: \n(1) In which subject areas they focus their research efforts, and the research methods they \nadopt. In exercising these freedoms, staff must ensure that, as agreed by, their academic \npeers, relevant academic associations and professional bodies, and national and \ninternational governmental bodies: \n(A) their research does not contravene international and national laws, and institutional \ncodes of ethical principles and practices, working conditions and regulations, specific \nto their academic discipline and the subject(s) chosen for research (for example the \ncollection and use of human tissue in genetic research requires prior informed \nconsent); \np.11 \n(B) their research does not contravene generic international and national laws, and \ninstitutional codes of ethical principles and practices, working conditions and \nregulations, in relation to financial control and audit, personnel management, the \nanonymisation, collection, disclosure, disposal, protection, and storage of sensitive \nand personal data, the maintenance of workplace health and safety, the management \nof risk to research workers, participants and third parties, the registration of IPR, etc.; \n(C) persons employed for research are appointed, via an open, well documented and \ntransparent selection process, solely on the basis of their research excellence, \nexpertise and experience and are not subject to discrimination on the basis of the \nfactors identified above; \n(D) notwithstanding point (C) above, where required by national or state legislation, \nacademic staff may exercise affirmative action to secure employment for groups \nunder-represented in research positions in universities, but this must be undertaken \nstrictly in adherence with the relevant legislation and recorded as such. Such \ntemporary measures must discontinued when the objectives of equality of \nopportunity and treatment are achieved. \n(E) where research is undertaken by using financial and other resources from an external \nagency (either private or public), the requirements and conditions of any sponsoring \nagency must be clearly established and expressed in a mutually agreed contract or \nequivalent document. More particularly, there must be no undeclared conflict of \ninterest (academic, financial or personal in nature) in the proposed research and the \nrelative rights of the research sponsors and researchers over research outputs \n(respecting the ownership, publication and subsequent use and exploitation of \nresearch data) must be made clear. Progress on sponsored research must be provided \naccurately and regularly, and any deviations to the contract (e.g., delay, early \ncompletion or termination, re-definition,  etc.), and the reasons for them reported \nfully. \n(F) national and institutional systems of quality assurance exist to ensure that all research \napplications are scrutinised and have prior ethical approval, and to investigate \ncomplaints and expressions of concern about breaches of ethical procedures, \nwhereby such breaches can be investigated and appropriate actions taken. \n(2) With whom and for what purpose they pursue their research. No member of a university \nmay be required to participate in academic or artistic work which conflicts with his\/her \nconscience.  \np.12 \n(3) The methods and avenues by which they disseminate, make accessible, exploit and \ncommercialise the findings of their research. In exercising this freedom, staff must ensure \nthat, as agreed by their academic peers and relevant academic associations and \nprofessional bodies, their research outputs: \n(A) accurately and honestly report the full results of their research and are not subject to \nplagiarism, forgery, misleading manipulation or partial reporting of research data and \nresults; \n(B) acknowledge fully and fairly the relative direct and indirect contributions of co- and \njoint authors, academic colleagues and other people and organisations (including \nsponsors) involved in the research; \n(C) do not compromise the anonymity of research participants, co-researchers and \nsponsoring bodies, breach personal or institutional confidentiality, or infringe \nintellectual property rights agreements. \nFew in European academia would gainsay the previous statements, variations of which \nappear within national and institutional pronouncements on academic freedom and to which, \nArblaster maintains, \u2018[e]very vice-chancellor, college principal and education minister pays \nverbal tribute\u2019 (Arblaster, 1974, 10). However, such declarations constitute just the bare bones \nof academic freedom. The vital flesh that covers them, and gives operational sustenance to the \nconcept in both the intellectual spirit and the day to day minutiae of university life, lies in the \nnorms and procedures of shared governance and tenured employment which are, as Gerber \nmaintains, \u2018the two principal institutional bulwarks for academic freedom\u2019 (Gerber, 2001, 22).  \nPrevious research by Karran (2007) into the laws on academic tenure revealed variations \nbetween the different EU states, but showed, categorically that some form of tenure \n(sometimes via competition and\/or with a limited term) is the norm rather than the exception.  \nHence, for a working, rather than merely postulatory, definition of academic freedom for the \nEuropean states, these must be addressed. \nSelf Governance \nTo guarantee academic freedom, academic staff must: \n(1) Have the right to voice opinions on the educational policies and priorities within their \ninstitutions without the imposition or threat of punitive action, and fulfill their collegial \nobligations in a professional manner. In exercising this freedom, staff must ensure that: \n(A) all staff have an equal right to speak and their opinions and beliefs are accorded due \nrespect; \np.13 \n(B) all personal, departmental and institutional professional commitments are fulfilled in \na timely and professional manner. \n(2) Have the determinant voice and prominent role in decision making processes. How this is \nachieved will differ with national and institutional variations in the decision making \nstructures of universities. In universities where the Senate, comprising the academic \nteaching staff, is the sole deliberative and executive body, decisions will, perforce, \nrequire the support of the majority of academic staff. In universities in which the Senate \nalso includes representatives of students, and research and nonacademic staff, or in which \nexecutive powers are shared between the Senate and one or more internal or external \nbodies, protocols must exist ensuring that the voices of the academic staff are primus \ninter pares, and guarding against filibustering, policy gridlock and professorial oligarchy. \nFor example, by giving 60 out of 100 Senate seats to academic staff, but applying a \nthreshold of 70 votes for an ordinance to be enacted, the academic staff have the major \nsay in decision making, but cannot ignore the opinions of other participating groups. \nWhere policies are determined following due democratic process, staff are professionally \nobligated to assist in their implementation, even though personally they may disagree \nwith the policies. \n(3) Be able to appoint, from amongst their number, people into positions of managerial \nauthority, and hold them to periodic account by agreed democratic processes. However, \nin exercising these powers academic staff: \n(A) where required by national or state legislation, or institutional guidelines, may \nexercise affirmative action to secure entry to managerial positions from groups \nunder-represented in such positions in universities, but this must be undertaken \nstrictly in adherence with the relevant legislation and guidance and recorded as such. \nSuch temporary measures must be discontinued when the objectives of equality of \nopportunity and treatment are achieved. \n(B) should ensure that the burden of administration does not repeatedly fall on the same \nindividual(s) and\/or departments, by limiting the number of consecutive terms an \nindividual can spend in a particular post, and rotating the posts between departments. \n(4) Be able to determine who shall serve as Rector. Where possible the Rector should be \nappointed from within the University by democratic process with the support of the \nmajority of academic staff, and subjected to the same democratic process if additional \nterms of office are sought by an incumbent Rector. There should be a limit to the number \nof consecutive terms an individual can serve. Where the appointment is external (owing \np.14 \nto a dearth of suitable internal candidates, or because of national or state legislation), the \nacademic staff should have the major role in determining the appointment. The form of \nthis role will vary between institutions and countries but could include determining the \nshort list of candidates, voting to choose one from a shortlist of candidates drawn up \nexternally, having the right of veto of an externally selected candidate. As with other \ngovernance procedures, the aim is to encourage active participation whilst preventing \nprofessorial obstinacy and capriciousness.  \nTenure \nTenure is granted to academics so that they can undertake their teaching and research \nduties to the highest levels of professional competence. Tenure gives academics the freedom \nto undertake research which questions accepted knowledge, via avant-garde ideas and \ncontroversial theories, which are then tested in the crucible of expert critical debate with \nstudents and staff, without fear of reprisal. The corollary of this is that those academics who \ncease to perform their duties in an active, competent and professional manner neither need, \nnor merit, the protection of tenure. Defining adequate cause for dismissal is, therefore, as \nnecessary an element of academic freedom as the granting of tenure. \nHence, to guarantee and protect the integrity of academic freedom, contractual \narrangements must exist ensuring that only academic staff with the requisite high level of \ncompetence in research and teaching are given protection from the fear of dismissal for the \nviews they express; and enable action to be taken, through due process, to remove tenure from \nstaff who fail to meet minimum levels of competence or professional standards of conduct in \nthese areas, or for whom, because of bona fide circumstances (programme viability and \ninstitutional financial exigency), the university is unable to continue to offer employment. \nThese processes are different in nature. In the first it is incumbent upon the probationer to \ndemonstrate competence, in the second it is incumbent on the institution to demonstrate due \ncause. However, the process whereby tenure is removed should be as stringent and rigorous as \nthat whereby it is awarded. To uphold the integrity of academic freedom, faculty members \nmust just as willing and empowered to recommend the revocation of tenure and the dismissal \nof a faculty member for just cause, as they are to recommend the granting of tenure for staff \nthat meet the necessarily high probationary standards. How these processes operate will differ \nin accordance with national, federal and state variations in generic employment law and the \ncontractual arrangements and obligations of individual higher education institutions. At the \nvery least any system should ensure that: \np.15 \n(1) The terms and conditions of every appointment are supplied, in writing, to each staff \nmember on appointment (as are any subsequent revisions to that appointment). Any \nlimitations on academic freedom resulting from the distinct nature of the institution (e.g. \nif it has specific religious beliefs), should be clearly stated. Additionally, a full \nexplanation of the procedures for the approval and revocation of tenure should be clearly \ndocumented. \n(2) There is a statutory probationary period of employment: \n(A) During which staff have the full protection of academic freedom enjoyed by all other \nacademic staff. \n(B) Which is of finite length (typically between five to seven years and which may be \nserved at more than one institution), sufficient to enable assessment of the \ncandidates\u2019 professional expertise and commitment. \n(C) During which the peer review process has the ability to exclude all those who \ndemonstrably cannot meet the requisite professional standards in respect to their \nteaching and research responsibilities. \n(D) At an agreed date before the end of which, probationary staff should be subjected to \nan agreed peer review procedure, (see (4) below) which determines whether they are \noffered continued employment in a tenured position, or whether their employment \nceases at the end of the probationary period, and probationers should be informed of \nthe outcome in writing and may request the reasons which contributed to the \ndecision. \n(3) Prior to the start of the probationary period, the procedures of the tenure process are \nclearly stated in writing, including a full explanation of, e.g., minimum requirements in \nterms of the provision of lectures and tutorials and the production of published research \noutputs, details of the internal system of peer review, etc. The relative weights applied to \nthese activities must be made known to the candidate at the start of the probationary \nperiod. \n(4) There is a rigorous peer review system for assessing whether staff are granted tenure at \nthe end of their probationary period and as a part of which: \n(A) staff provide a portfolio describing their work during their probationary period. Such \na portfolio is likely to include information on the following: \n(i) Teaching: lectures and seminars (at undergraduate and postgraduate levels), and, \nif appropriate, peer and student evaluations of teaching competence; \np.16 \n(ii) Research activities including successful grant applications, published outputs \n(whether in print, accepted for publication or submitted for publication), creative \nartefacts, other scholarly efforts and PhD supervision; \n(iii) Pastoral care and other services for students; \n(iv) Managerial and administrative duties and service on committees, within the \nuniversity; \n(v) Public service for the community at local, state or national level; \n(vi) Other evidence of scholarly merit or academic recognition, such as fellowships, \nhonors, and election to office in scholarly or professional organisations. \n(vii) The names of possible external reviewers, of a rank higher than the candidate, \nand able to make informed judgements as to the candidate\u2019s academic merit. \n(B) The candidate\u2019s Head of Department, after consultation by an agreed process with \ncolleagues of a rank higher than the candidate, submits the names of external \nevaluators able to make informed judgements as to the candidate\u2019s academic merit. \n(C) An institutional Tenure Review Committee is established which \n(i) comprises members, none of whom are known, personally or academically to the \ncandidate, of a rank higher than the candidate, chosen by democratic selection \nfrom among the Faculty on the basis of their objectivity and competence, to \nserve for a set period, and which elects its own Chair.. \n(ii) reviews the submissions from the candidate and the Departmental Head and \nselects from them an agreed number of external reviewers, from whom it solicits \nan appraisal of the candidate\u2019s merit, based on a critical review of the \ncandidate\u2019s portfolio of achievement. Evaluators may also be asked to comment \non other aspects of the candidate\u2019s case of which they may have specific \nfamiliarity, such as papers heard delivered at conferences. Institutional \nguidelines about the nature of the review process must be provided to reviewers \nwho must judge the candidate purely on the basis of competence, rather than any \nsubstantive viewpoints the candidate may have expressed, and without reference \nto any other of the candidate\u2019s attributes which are deemed irrelevant. To \nencourage objective and unequivocal evaluations, the external reviewers must be \nassured that their statements will be confidential. \n(iii) deliberates in camera to consider, by an agreed process of free debate, the \nevaluation of the candidate\u2019s merit as expressed by the external reviewers, and \nmakes a recommendation as to whether the candidate should be offered tenure. \np.17 \n(5) There is a rigorous system of assessing whether tenure should be terminated because of \nlack of programme viability, as a part of which \n(A) An institutional Committee is established which \n(i) comprises members, none of whom are known, personally or academically to the \naffected staff, chosen by democratic selection from among the Faculty on the \nbasis of their objectivity and competence, to serve for a set period, but which \ndoes not include staff whose jobs are at risk through the termination of the \nprogramme, and which elects its own Chair.  \n(ii) reviews the decision to formally cease a program of instruction, ensuring that \nsuch a decision is based on a comprehensive appraisal of the likely long term \nimpact on the institution of continuing or discontinuing with the programme. \n(iii) recommends either continuing or discontinuing the relevant programme. \n(vi) hears appeals from affected staff against their relocation to comparable posts \nand\/or job termination following a decision to discontinue a programme. \n(B) Every effort is made by the institution to provide affected staff with comparable \nemployment elsewhere in the institution, including the provision of additional re-\ntraining. \n(C) Where a tenured post is removed, it should not be filled within agreed period of time, \nwithout first offering it to the previous post-holder. The tenured employment of a \nfaculty member will not be terminated in favor of retaining a faculty member without \ntenure, except in extraordinary circumstances, the reasons for which must be well-\ndocumented. \n(6) There is a rigorous system of assessing whether tenure shall be terminated because of \ninstitutional financial exigency as a part of which: \n(A) An institutional Committee is established which: \n(i) is composed of members, none of whom are known, personally or academically \nto the affected staff, chosen by democratic selection from among the Faculty on \nthe basis of their objectivity and competence, to serve for a set period, but which \ndoes not include staff whose jobs are at risk through institutional financial \nexigency, and which elects its own Chair.  \n(ii) establishes whether a situation of bon fide financial exigency exists, or is likely \nto exist, of such a magnitude (for example, inability to meet operating expenses) \nthat it constitutes a threat to the continued survival of the institution and cannot \nbe remedied by any other means. \np.18 \n(ii) determines what actions need to be taken to alleviate the situation. \n(iii) sets the criteria for identifying the staff whose tenure shall be removed, and \napplies them. \n(vi) ensures that all possible alternatives to the termination of tenure among the staff \nthus identified (such as transfers and re-training) have been exhausted. \n(B) Where a tenured post is removed, it shall not be filled within agreed period of time, \nwithout first offering it to the previous post-holder. \n(7) There is a rigorous system of assessing whether tenure shall be revoked and employment \nterminated because of just cause (that is, for reasons other than lack of programme \nviability or institutional financial exigency). At the very least any system should ensure \nthat \n(A) A full written explanation of the grounds and procedures for the revocation of tenure \nis supplied to each staff member on appointment. The grounds that are deemed valid \nmay vary between different nations and universities, in accordance with the differing \ndegrees of importance that are attached (through individual institutional customs and \npractices) to the various elements of the academic role. However, these are likely to \ninclude unlawful activities (e.g. theft of funds or property), abuse of the constituent \nelements of academic freedom identified above, repeated and systematic failure to \nfulfill academic duties (e.g. in the areas of teaching and research) to the minimum \nstandards required to merit the protection of academic freedom afforded by the \noriginal granting of tenure, and of the following violations of institutional and \nprofessional norms (as identified by Braxton and Bayer 1999, 21-38): \n(i) Moral Turpitude - depraved, unprincipled acts by faculty members (e.g. sexual \nrelationships with a student, making suggestive sexual comments to a student, \nintoxication by dint of consumption of alcohol or drugs). \n(ii) Particularistic Grading - the uneven or preferential treatment of students in the \ndetermining of grades (e.g. differential application of policies about late \nsubmission of assessments). \n(iii) Condescending Negativism - the treatment of both colleagues and students in a \ncondescending and demeaning way (e.g. criticising a colleague\u2019s work in front \nof students). \n(iv) Inattentive Planning - a lack of attention to the planning of a course (e.g. failing \nto provide a syllabus for students before commencing a course). \np.19 \n(v) Personal Disregard - failure to address the needs and sensitivities of students as \nindividuals (e.g. habitually arriving late to classes and finishing them early). \n(vi) Uncommunicated Course Details - failure to inform students of important \nparticulars about a course (e.g. changes in class and examination times and \nlocations without due notice). \n(vii) Uncooperative Cynicism \u2013 inveterate refusal to participate actively in \nlegitimately assigned departmental duties as part of the role of university \nteaching (e.g. persistent absence from departmental management meetings, \ncontemptuous neglect of teaching duties). \nProcedural standards for the conduct of tenure revocation and staff dismissal \nhearings may vary in accordance with national employment law and institutional \nstatutes, but are likely to include the appellant\u2019s right \n(i) not to request a hearing, provided that the appropriate bodies are informed in \nwriting, within a specified period prior to the hearing. \n(ii) for sufficient time to prepare a defence. \n(iii) to request that the hearing is held in private, not in public. \n(iv) to appoint an external advocate to assist in the preparation and presentation of \nwritten and oral defence evidence. \n(v) of access to all institutional documents, relevant to the case. \n(vi) to call witnesses (from within the university and from other universities) to \nattend the hearing and give evidence, on the appellant\u2019s behalf. \n(vii) to question, either in person or via an external advocate, all witnesses at the \nhearing who testify orally. \n(viii) to address, either in person or via an external advocate, all written evidence \nconsidered at the hearing, including witness statements. \n(B) An institutional Tenure Review Committee (either a Standing Committee, or one \nespecially convened) is established:  \n(i) which is composed of members, none of whom are known, personally or \nacademically to the appellant, chosen by democratic selection from among the \nFaculty on the basis of their objectivity and competence, to serve for a set \nperiod, and which elects its own Chair.  \n(ii) which undertakes a confidential, informal assessment as to whether there are \nreasonable grounds to question the fitness of a faculty member who has tenure or \nwhose period of appointment has not expired, and establishes whether formal \np.20 \nproceedings to consider revocation of tenure and subsequent dismissal should be \ninitiated. \n(iii) which determines whether formal proceedings are warranted. If they are, the \ncommittee should: \n(a) issue a formal written statement to the person concerned, specifying the \ngrounds for the revocation of tenure to be considered at an evidential \nhearing; \n(b) indicate the date, time and location of the evidential hearing, undertaken by \nthe relevant university committee, to determine the veracity of the grounds \nfor the revocation of tenure; \n(c) request a written response, within a specified time period, indicating \nwhether the appellant wishes the hearing to go ahead, and if so, petition a \nwritten response in rebuttal of the stated grounds; \n(d) clarify and inform the appellant of his\/her procedural rights; \n(e) assign an appropriately qualified administrator to gather and present \nsupportive evidence for the grounds of tenure revocation. \n(iv) that meets at the due date and deliberates upon the statement of grounds for \ndismissal and the written rebuttal provided by the appellant. If the appellant has \ndetermined not to have a hearing, and has therefore provided no rebuttal, the \nCommittee should adjudicate on the basis of the available evidence, and \ndetermine whether tenure should be revoked. If the appellant opts to have a \nhearing, it is the duty of the Committee to: \n(a) examine the grounds for tenure revocation and the appellant\u2019s rebuttal. \n(b) assess the veracity of these statements, by reference to written evidence and \nvia the questioning of witnesses by the Committee, the appellant or his \nadvocate, and the administrator appointed to gather supportive evidence for \ntenure revocation. \n(c) hear oral arguments advanced by the appellant or his advocate, and the \nadministrator appointed to gather supportive evidence for tenure revocation. \n(d) provide definitive verdicts, stating whether each of the grounds cited for the \nrevocation of tenure is upheld or denied; \n(e) issue a conclusive report, on the basis of the verdicts reached, to either \nrevoke or retain tenure for the appellant. \n(8) There is an Appeals System under whichxxx \np.21 \n(A) unsuccessful candidates can appeal against: \n(i) tenure denial on the grounds of negligent process or inadequate consideration; \n(ii) tenure revocation on the grounds of programme non-viability: \n(iii) tenure revocation on the grounds of institutional financial exigency: \n(iv) tenure revocation on the grounds of just cause, for reasons other than programme \nnon-viability or institutional financial exigency. \n(B) an Appeals Committee is established, composed of members, chosen on the basis of \ntheir objectivity and competence by a process of democratic selection from among \nthe Faculty, to serve for a set period and which elects its own Chair. None of \ncommittee must be known, personally or academically to the appellant, and in the \ncases examining tenure denial decisions, they must be of a rank higher than the \nappellant. In the case of tenure revocation for just cause, the Appeals Committee will \nbe drawn from the University\u2019s Governing Body. \n(C) the Appeals Committee assesses, in camera, whether the Tenure Review Committee \nfollowed due processes, in line with national or state legislation and the relevant \nstatutes and standards of the institution, when: \n(i) evaluating a candidate\u2019s case for tenure approval,. The Appeals Committee \ncannot reverse a tenure denial decision, but may request reconsideration by the \nTenure Review Committee, indicating the areas in which it believes the process \nwas negligent or the consideration inadequate. \n(ii) evaluating the case for tenure revocation on the grounds of programme non-\nviability. The Committee may request reconsideration of the grounds for \nprogramme non-viability and hear appeals from affected staff against their \nrelocation to comparable posts and\/or job termination following a decision to \ndiscontinue a programme. \n(iii) evaluating the case for tenure revocation on the grounds of financial exigency. \nThe Committee may request reassessment as to whether a state of financial \nexigency exists, or of the criteria used to identify staff at risk, or of the \napplication of those criteria. \n(iv) evaluating the case for tenure revocation on the grounds of just cause. The \nCommittee may request reconsideration, indicating the respects in which it \nbelieves the process was negligent, the consideration inadequate, or the outcome \nunjust in the light of new evidence. \np.22 \n(C) the Appeals Committee provides copies of its deliberations, indicating the reasons \nfor either upholding or denying the appeal, to the appellants, the designated \nuniversity administrative officer and the Tenure Review Committee which, if \nrequested, will be re-constituted to examine new evidence, ameliorate assumed \nnegligent or inadequate practice in its deliberations, and produce a report of its \ndeliberations for consideration by the Appeals Committee. The decision of the \nAppeals Committee is final. \n(D) if the Appeals Committee requests reconsideration by the Tenure Review \nCommittee, it assesses the report arising from the reconsideration, and makes a final \ndecision, indicating the reasons for either upholding or denying the appeal, to the \nappellants, the designated university administrative officer and the Tenure Review \nCommittee. \nConclusion and Next Steps \nThis paper\u2019s major rationale was to answer the criticisms of Barnett (1990, 137) and others, \nby moving beyond the usual formulaic approaches which suggest that academic freedom is \nimportant but is so finely nuanced, historically specific, etc. that definitions are not only \nimpossible, but should not even be attempted. Additionally, there was a desire to respond to a \nlong standing call for an authoritative canon stipulating not only the rights of academic \nfreedom but also its limitations, thereby providing a practical modus vivendi for the concept \nwithin today\u2019s studia generalia. Nearly forty years ago Lord Ashby, then Cambridge\u2019s Vice \nChancellor, echoing Humboldt\u2019s principles, described the distinctive feature of a university as \n\u2018the essential relevance of research to teaching\u2019, but lamented that the academic profession \nhad no declared ethical code and therefore called for a Hippocratic Oath for higher education \nwhich could \u2018stabilise . . . a schizophrenic and disintegrating profession and \u2026 provide a \nbasis of leadership, authority and example to students\u2019 (Ashby, 1969, pp 64, 66) which idea \nhas recently been given greater clarity and support by Watson (2007). Similarly, Thorens \n(2000, 281) has argued that \u2018academic freedom and university autonomy are necessary, that a \nuniversal charter on them is also necessary. Indeed, all previous documents - some of great \nvalue - which have been written in the last few decades are either local or regional, as far as \ntheir origin goes. Or they concern one type of institution. Or again, they are very general and \nmix up academic freedom and other concepts. A universal charter is therefore desirable\u2019. \nFollowing from Thorens\u2019 exhortation, the European Union already has a Magna Charta \nUniversitatum, establishing a Magna Charta Libertatis Academicae, constitutes a desirable \np.23 \nnext step. Such a document would protect the professional rights of staff, and raise vocational \nstandards, whilst providing enhanced protection for students from abuses of academic \nfreedom.  \nTo take this work forward, requires that this preliminary definition, like all academic \nresearch that attempts to advance knowledge, is tempered and tested within the crucible of \ninformed and rigorous academic debate. Most of the elements of this working definition are \nderived from, and relate to, common strands of national legislation on academic freedom \nwithin the EU states, however, questions that could usefully be addressed include the \nfollowing. To what extent, and in what ways, does this definition contradict the constitutions \nand laws of the European Union and its constituent states? To what extent does it infringe the \nacademic freedom of students? What support would there be within the academic staff of \nEurope\u2019s universities to implement such a definition? How similar\/different is it from national \nlegislation on employment protection? Would implementing such a definition lead to a \nreduction in academic freedom in some states? Would implementing such a definition \nstrengthen the European Higher Education Learning Space? How readily could such a \ndefinition be incorporated into the European Revision Treaty, or an academic Bill of Rights? \nMore importantly, would it be necessary to have a supra-national authority to which appeals \ncould be made to ensure that the requirements of any such Magna Charta are upheld? \nFurther work on refining the concept of academic freedom is both timely and necessary. \nFor example, following Barnett\u2019s suggestion, \u2018a theory of academic freedom which does \njustice to the actual relationship between higher education and society rather than an \nimaginary relationship\u2019 (Barnett, 1988, 90), would do much to strengthen and protect the \nconcept. Similarly, little empirical work has been undertaken on how academic staff \nunderstand, experience, and make use of their academic freedom in European universities, or \nwhether and what types of academic freedoms could (and should) be afforded to students. \nMore important than this, however, is a recognition by academics that the protection of \nacademic freedom is something in which they should become actively involved. There is a \ntendency, given both the ever growing pressures to teach more students and write more \narticles, for university staff to ignore the process whereby, via legislation or legerdemain, \nacademic freedom is being slowly but irrevocably eroded. Academic freedom brings rights \nand responsibilities - a major one of which is ensuring that such rights are there to be used and \nenjoyed by future generations of scholars. Society at large will only sanction the granting of \nparticular freedoms to a specific professional group, if it is persuaded that these freedoms \nproduce net benefits. Hence it is incumbent on today\u2019s academics to voice, with passion and \np.24 \npersuasion, the reasons for the continuance of academic freedom. Neglecting such a \nresponsibility will surely impoverish academics, academia, and the free society in which they \noperate. \n \np.25 \nReferences \n \n\u00c5kerlind, G. and Kayrooz, C.
