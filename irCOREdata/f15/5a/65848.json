This landscape considered as an icon of \u2018Englishness\u2019 is re-visited \nthrough the embodied and sensory experiences of post-migration residents of \nLancashire and Cumbria. This was an attempt to unravel multiple relationships \nembedded in visitor engagements with this landscape and thus disrupt the moral \ngeography of this landscape as embodying a singular English sensibility, \nnormally exclusionary of British multi-ethnic, translocal and mobile landscape \nvalues and sensibilities.

These are examined in this paper as \nrepresenting the values, sensory meanings and embodied relationships that exist \nfor migrant communities with this landscape. These groups are from the Asian \ncommunity from Burnley and a \u2018mixed\u2019 art group living in Lancashire and \nCumbria.

It is managed by the \u2018Lake District National Park Authority\u2019 (LDNPA). For the \npurposes of this paper the acronyms of LDNP and LDNPA will be used to denote these respectively. \n 3 \nFear in Paradise: the affective registers of the English Lake district landscape, \nre-visited \n \nIntroduction \nThe English Lake District has been culturally valorised as embodying a space \nwhere we can engage with a national landscape \u2018sensibility\u2019. The \u2018national\u2019 in \nthis regard often slides between being British and English, to simplify matters \nhere, I will refer to these as nationally England and as cultures of Englishness. The \nparticipants in this research and their responses to landscape are both situated \nwithin England, as residents and through the research process, however, their \npolitical citizenship is \u2018British\u2019. The cultural building blocks of experiencing a \nnational park that orientate the \u2018senses\u2019 towards a connection with what it is to \nbe English are made up of visual, aural and literary texts. The Lake District has \nan identification of a cultural landscape that is iconic through its historical \nconnections with landmark visual artists such as W.M.J.Turner and John \nConstable, and authors such as Wordsworth and Ruskin. Poetry, Painting, art \nand landscape merge into a textural palimpsest of a recognisable iconographic \nsource of connection with the sensory experiences that these artists responded to \nand worked through in their art. This \u2018iconography\u2019 of Englishness is at once a \n\u2018visual space\u2019 that engenders a \u2018structure of feeling\u2019 which associates you \nsensually and artfully to a cultural marker of belonging and being within the \nhistorically assembled, national sensibility (Daniels and Cosgrove, 1988). This \npaper, seeks firstly to engage with the emotional registers of this \u2018structure of \nfeeling\u2019 evoked in this landscape in contemporary culture, which makes it an \nEnglish place and simultaneously a textualised \u2018theatre of memory\u2019 (Samuel \n1989). Secondly I seek to investigate the sensory responses that contemporary \nEnglish visitors have to this palimpsest, including those from communities not \n 4 \ntypically associated with an Englishness that is recorded in this textualised \nnarration of past sensibilities rooted in a national \u2018structure of feeling\u2019. \nTraditionally, these have been figured through a masculinist sensibility (Nash \n1996; Rose 1997) and bound up within cultural texts that are collaged to form a \nsingular bounded notion of national culture, formulated as a \u2018moral\u2019 landscape \nof nation (Matless, 1998). Green (1995) has argued that these landscape values \noften reflect the \u2018currency of universal and immanent meanings\u2019 which occlude \nhistoricist analysis and issues of social access and power (p40). The purpose of \nthis paper s is not to re-assert a two-dimensional, singular landscape culture \nbased within the Lake District landscape, but to encourage the engagement with \nthis site as a contested landscape whose representations and cultural narratives \nare too often figured as exclusionary of multiple histories and experiences \nincluding those of gendered and racialised cultural narratives. \n \nThe visual methodology used was designed with artist Graham Lowe. Within \nthe visual workshops set up, we sought to explore complex, heterogeneous \ncultures and sensibilities which also contribute to a modern Englishness that is \nformed through migrational cultural values from Eastern Europe, the Indian sub-\ncontinent, Ireland and Scotland. The process of mapping of these sensibilities \nthrough drawings and paintings traces a set of affective registers that are not \nnormally encountered in representations of this cultural landscape. The visual \nmaterials from the research aim to make tangible a divergent set of sensory \nresponses to this landscape and show how affect and emotion are experienced. \nThey show a need for an engagement with the heterogeneity of affectual registers \nsuch as \u2018fear\u2019 and \u2018terror\u2019. The emotional and affectual registers that are \nrepresented on canvas are understood as being formed within in specific \ntemporal and spatial fields of experience, beyond singular registers of \u2018fear\u2019 and \n 5 \n\u2018terror\u2019 (Tolia-Kelly, 2006). Firstly I will outline the relationship between viewing \ncultural landscapes and emotional connectivity, in landscape research. The \nrelationship between vision and emotion however is complex, but by starting \nwith a consideration of the picturesque tradition I hope to illustrate the lack of \nwriting on landscape which engages with \u2018embodied\u2019 and \u2018emotional\u2019 cultural \nengagements in the contemporary English Lake District landscape. \n \nThe picturesque tradition: emotion and landscape aesthetics  \n \nPlate One: Claude Lorraine (also G\u00e9ll\u00e9\u00e9) \u2013 Landscape with Goatherds (1636) \n  \nThe artist Claude Lorraine has been inspirational to British landscape artists and \nhas said to have inspired J.M.W. Turner\u2019s own landscape painting. Lorraine\u2019s \nwork exemplifies the art of the \u2018picturesque\u2019 in the 17th century. The value and \nexperience of the \u2018picturesque\u2019 landscape can be traced from writers such as \nEdmond Burke through to William Gilpin, and painters such as J.M.W. Turner. \nPicturesque landscape art developed in the 18th century between \u2018idealism\u2019 in the \nlandscape tradition of the 17th century and the Romantic tradition of the 19th \ncentury. The cultural sensibility of the picturesque tradition is one which \ncelebrated classical cultures, but which simultaneously celebrated nature\u2019s wild \ntextures and forms. The roughness and drama of natural forms are framed \nwithin a \u2018timeless\u2019 perspective. Landscape with Goatherds epitomized Claude \nLorraine\u2019s attitude to nature and form in landscape. The classical forms in this \npainting set a nostalgic \u2018tone\u2019, representing a natural relationship between man, \nGod and nature. Lorraine\u2019s paintings reflect the drama of nature, through use of \nscale; often contrasts between light and dark are reduced create a sense of \ndistance. Lorraine inspired J.M.W. Turner\u2019s own Landscape in the early years of \n 6 \nhis art. Gombrich (1995, p396) argues that \u2018It was Claude who first opened \npeople\u2019s eyes to the sublime beauty of nature\u2019. In this period and up to a century \nafter his death, landscape was understood and was \u2018looked for\u2019 in the form \nrecognizable through the paintings of Lorraine. As Lorraine\u2019s images were \nencountered in popular culture as sepia replicas, tourists carried with them a \nblack glass lens (Claude Glass) through which to view their scene so that \nlandscape could imitate picture. The engagement with landscape was figured \nthrough prior textual encounters. The landscape itself was re-shaped to meet the \nviewer\u2019s expectations of form, structure and composition of a site. Nature, in \nthese viewings and experiences was not engaged with in its \u2018natural\u2019 rhythm; \ninstead it was carefully choreographed, to please the ocular fashions of the day. \nThe relationship between the picturesque viewer and the scene is not figured as \nholistic corporeal engagement, but simply as a process of picturing. John Ruskin \nprized the \u2018wild\u2019 qualities reflected in J.M.W. Turner\u2019s works, seeing them as \nrepresenting the \u2018natural fact\u2019 of wild nature (Hewison et al, 2000, p28). The \npaintings of Lorraine also inspired Wordsworth in his engagement with the \nEnglish Lakes; the realism of nature\u2019s textures were an inspiration for \nunderstanding beauty and led to the Romantic aesthetic in Wordsworth\u2019s own \nart. The distance between the visceral experience and the visual in the \npicturesque tradition privileges perspective, and aesthetics.  \n \nPolitically, the aesthetics of the picturesque tradition celebrated un-peopled \nlandscapes, or where there were people, they became part of nature and its \nrhythms, it also embraced Northern landscapes. Darby (2000) argues that this \ntradition valorized both the landscapes of the Lakes as central to \u2018national\u2019 \nculture situated in the \u2018provincial\u2019 spaces of Britain; de-centering the urban \ncultures of accumulation of wealth and Imperial slavery (p73). The \u2018picturesque\u2019 \n 7 \nwas a precursor to Romanticism, which rejected capitalism, and the \nencroachment of industry into spaces of the countryside. Aesthetics in Turner\u2019s \npaintings became accentuated representations of earth, sky and sea, without \n\u2018realism\u2019. In Turner\u2019s early paintings [for example see \u2018Barnard Castle\u2019 c1825] \nwhere \u2018nature\u2019 is secondary to the forms of architecture of the castle, the \naesthetics of the castle are \u2018naturalized\u2019 through their depiction through light and \na reduction of their form into nodes of light and color. Their manmade \nfunctionality of the castle is distanced, and the historic stone given life through \nlight. Turner\u2019s \u2018Northern tour\u2019 also challenged the pictorial differences between \nrepresentations of \u2018South\u2019 and \u2018North\u2019. \n \nWhat is occluded in the picturesque tradition is the idea of the dynamism of \nlandscape and emotional values of the cultural landscape. In the picturesque \nlandscape, the sovereignty of the viewer is enabled only through their looking \nwith a particular stance, both physically, socially and politically. The relationship \nbetween emotional responses to a scene and the aesthetics ad form of \nrepresentation are not of primary cultural or intellectual value. What is needed is \nan understanding of aesthetic developments in landscape art that explore the \nways in which Turner and others are drawn to this landscape as a result of \nemotional responses and values. This is linked to positioning the \u2018viewer\u2019 (as \nmany writers have commented) as visual commander of the scene (Mitchell, \n1994; Cosgrove, 1984). The picturesque landscape \u2018works\u2019 for those with a \nparticular social status \u201aThe center\u2019s turn to its own mountainous north, \nEngland\u2019s Lake District, marks the production of another layer of opposition to \nthat progressive England, as aesthetics and sentiment combined to locate \ncontinuity and tradition in the landscape\u201b that denies economic organization of \nthe land and cultural change (Newman 1987, p117, quoted in Darby 2000, p77). \n 8 \nAs an aesthetic form the picturesque landscapes of Lorraine and Turner are \npurely visual. The value of these representations that they hint at \u2018nostalgia\u2019, \n\u2018awe\u2019, but remain centered on the visual landscape perspective that avoids \ncorporeal encounter. England and Englishness is recognizable within this \n\u2018picturing\u2019 of landscape, of which the Lake District landscape became a culturally \nloaded place, from being empty and desolate (Darby 2000, p54). \n  \nThe English Lake District historically and contemporarily has been the site of the \nconsolidation of an exclusive memorial to a sense of Englishness. This as a site of \nexclusion, alienation and it being a site of multicultural history is a rare narrative. \nYet, international flows of people, plants and values of nature presenced in the \nlandscapes such as place names, and through the grammars and vocabularies of \nthe contemporary tourist economy, shapes this cultural space. The Englishness \nembedded here is not representative of the history of this site, or the flows of \nvalues, memories, narratives and histories which it embodies. It is a landscape \nmade meaningful as site of emotional connectivity. It is a landscape constructed, \nmade meaningful through multicultural mobility, memory and artefactual \nregisters of engagement, many of these have been theorized as \u2018incommunicable\u2019 \nand \u2018intangible\u2019. They are also those registers that are \u201anot often looked for\u201b in a \ncontemporary or multicultural context. In this research the missing record is \nreaddressed in some small way (Anderson and Smith, 2001). Nurturing Ecologies \nhas sought to make tangible these values and embodied relationships with the \nLake District landscape in a twenty-first century context. The aim is to make \ntangible through participants\u2019 own visual texts and the artist\u2019s reflections, the \nemotional value of the Lake District landscape to these British residents. Before I \noutline my research method I want to introduce some contemporary tensions on \nrace and exclusion in this iconic landscape. \n 9 \n \nThe Media and the Ethnic Englishness in the Lake District \nThroughout the summers of 2004, and 2005 several news stories hit the public \nmedia that focussed on the problem of access to the countryside for ethnic \nminority communities (BBC News Online, 2004a; The Guardian, 2005). Headlines \nsuch as \u201aCountry faces \u2018passive apartheid\u2019\u201d (BBC News online, 2004b) quoting the \nchairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, where Trevor Phillips responded \nto the growing concern over the countryside as being a \u2018white\u2019 space. All of these \nfigured the problem of \u2018nation\u2019 as being a divided environment along lines of \nethnicity, exposing the continuing debates about \u2018rightful belonging\u2019 to the \nEnglish landscape (Parekh, 1995; Kinsman, 1995). The LDNPA itself also \ncommissioned several reports in September 2003 (Research House U.K., 2003a; \n2003b; 2003c; 2003d) to investigate the nature of ethnic minority exclusion and \naccess. These reports claimed that ethnic minority communities felt \ndisenfranchised from visiting the park and that there were cultural and \nstructural prohibitions to greater access and enjoyment of the park for minority \nethnic communities. These included calls for better and cheaper forms of public \ntransport to the LDNP from local areas and cities, the cost and scarcity of which \nwas prohibitive to neighbouring communities from accessing the site. The report \nalso concluded that many did not have knowledge about the park and its facilities. \nTo encourage greater access the LDNPA decided to set aside additional budget \nfor guides for ethnic groups \u2013 this however was to be done at the expense of \ncutting all tours and guides available for \u2018non-special\u2019 visitors. This move by the \nLDNP caused national controversy \u2013 the headlines laid bare a seemingly \u2018cause \nand effect\u2019 decision in favour of encouraging reluctant and uninterested, black \nand ethnic (and usually urban) visitors at the expense of providing a service for \nthe already enthusiastic, supportive white middle-class visitor set. As a result a \n 10 \nprivate sponsor stepped in to save these threatened services to regular visitors. \nWhat this media storm revealed was that arguments that criticised moves to \nincrease attendance by minority-ethnic communities were seen to be unnecessary \nas it deemed that due to their difference culturally, it was not desirable that these \ngroups should be coerced into appreciation of this site, also they were seen to be \na \u2018discordant\u2019 market; visually, culturally and socially suspect. Agyeman (1990) \nargues that the environmental discourses around \u2018non-native belonging\u2019 in the \nEnglish landscape are in tune with cultural discourses which are exclusionary to \na black presence in the rural scene. These attitudes reflect the fact that there is \u201aa \nprocess of \u2018containment\u2019 is in operation, it keeps black people in certain specified \nareas\u201b (Agyeman 1990, p233). The research attempted to revisit these ideas \nthrough group discussions and through recording visitor relationships and \nvalues and thus review these claims. The Lake District was investigated as being \na landscape of nurturing value and one that held a valued place in the lives of \nBritish migrants. Their views, values and responses were recorded within the \nworkshops. Two forms of materials were produced, firstly a set of paintings and \nvisual collages made by the participants of the groups, and secondly in the set of \nfinal paintings produced by Graham Lowe, which are his reflections on the \nparticipants work, transcripts and the whole \u2018mapping\u2019 process. The paintings \nare situated within a broader cycle of structures of living as the interpretation of \nvalues is done through understanding their \u2018positioning\u2019 (Hall, 1990) of these \ngroups within British society. Perceptions and values of the landscape are \ncontextualised through \u2018oppositional\u2019 values of \u2018town\u2019 and \u2018country\u2019 (Williams, \n1973).  \n \n\u2018Doing\u2019 visual methodologies: making nurturing ecologies on paper \n 11 \nLandscape culture has been rooted within the canon of art history, limiting \ncultures of appreciation and value through the structures of \u2018aesthetic \nappreciation\u2019 and composition. Within cultural studies, engagements with \nquestions of \u2018what do pictures do?\u2019 in light of social and cultural geographies of \nmaking art, are limited (Crang, 2003). Green (1995) has also argued that \nlandscape appreciation has operated within \u2018a strait-jacket which inhibits \npossibilities for a more effectively historical understanding of landscape\u2019 (p33, \n1995). This is an \u2018elite\u2019 cultural lens that excludes everyday folks embodied and \nemotional engagement with landscapes. I sought to design a methodology that \nrecords the appreciation of the visual landscape from a perspective of \u2018everyday \nfolk\u2019 and in particular the landscape most associated with the visualising the \n\u2018national\u2019 culture; The English Lake District. The search was for a set of \nrepresentations, cartographical and sensory tracings of the experience of the Lake \nDistrict for those left marginal the national iconography. Working with the \nlandscape artist Graham Lowe allowed the opportunity to record and make \ntangible some \u2018other\u2019 national stories and sensibilities, inspired by this landscape. \nOverall the research attempts to trace a set of sensory responses to the landscape \nin a visual mode to enrich the cultural record, and thus extend the variety of \n\u2018sensibilities\u2019 encountered in artistic representations. This process is in the first \ninstance recording multi-ethnic sensibilities, and secondly through the \nproduction of a set of paintings, attempting to redraft the moral geographies of \nthe English Lakes that are usually encountered in the textual cornerstones of \nLake District art. The paintings stand as a material contribution to the archives of \nlandscape representations of the varieties of English in the story of the cultural \nvalues of this iconic landscape. The production of the final paintings is part of a \npolitical process, by offering a formal site and space (of the canvas and of the \ngallery) for the recording of everyday, emotional responses to the Lake District. \n 12 \nWithout the canvases the project would be a community-wide process of sharing \nresponses, instead the canvases, in some small way add a tangible archive to \nboth the community and more broadly, contributes to a more complete \ngenealogical picture of the Lake District\u2019s \u2018other\u2019 histories, and in particular, its \ntranslocal cultural history. The canvases are part of the art historical economy of \nLake District representation, produced by a professional artist.  \n \nThe texts produced in this research are presented here in light of the contextual \nprocess of production \u2013 to avoid narrowing \u2018dramatically the field of possibilities \nthrough which we might envisage the [cultures of the] visual\u2019 beyond \nrepresentation, but as a force shaping social identity and engagements with \nnature and landscape itself (Green, 1995, p34). This research method aims to \nensure that the text becomes the beginning of the process of recording the values \nof this landscape and not the final product from which art history can delimit \nmeanings, and ideas through their simple form. \n \n \nThinking and feeling landscape through an inclusive visual practice \n \nThe artist Graham Lowe and I met in Lancaster in October 2003, on discussing \nlandscape art it was clear that we had a mutual interest in memory, everyday \nvalues and the material English landscape. We believed that there was a need to \ninvestigate other \u2018visions\u2019 and examine an alternative perspective and also to \nrecord these in canvas form as these were landscape experiences not normally \nrecorded on canvas. This was a new visual practice which would enrich \ncontemporary writing on cultures of landscape which was attentive to embodied, \nmaterial and affectual registers of landscape values (e.g. Wylie, 2002; 2005). \n 13 \nHowever within this body of work, which has sought to be non-representational \nin its practice, has emerged as a set of narrations that are figured around singular \n(often masculine) encounters with landscape and embodied performance \nthrough it. This mode of engagement situates the articulator of landscape \ncultures often as sovereign negotiator, and empowered explorer of various \narticulations of landscape as a \u2018performative milieu\u2019; or negotiations of \u2018a post-\nphenomenological understanding of the formation and undoing of self and \nlandscape in practice\u2019 (Wylie, 2005), concluding with an idea that \u2018landscape \nmight best be described in terms of the entwined materialities and sensibilities \nwith which we act and sense\u2019 (p245). However, the \u2018we\u2019 of these empowered \nlandscape traversing remains a bounded universal body of mobile citizens freed \nof fear and concerns over racial and\/or sexual attack, fear of the lack of \u2018rightful \nencounter\u2019 with a particular moral geography governing access, and indeed, free \nof the chains of childcare, work and the economic constraints to roam. What is \nnecessary in these new theorisations of performative cultures of landscape as \npractice is an increased acknowledgement of the place of difference and power in \nshaping the matrices within which \u2018we\u2019 can engage with landscape (see also \nJazeel, 2005). Roaming in this light, becomes a limited mode of engagement, and \ncannot accommodate landscape cultures for all. In the research design there is a \npolitical intension to record multiple cultures of engagement of individuals and \ngroups who are fearful, frail and feel endangered by the concept of even just \nwalking the lakeside pathways of Windermere. Revisiting the sensory values \nembedded in the landscape with these various modes of engagement in mind \nincorporates a desire to recording values of emotional, multisensory beyond \nwritten text and for those not having the possibility of accessing this landscape \nthrough a visual or literary tradition of English Romanticism, with complete \nsovereignty. The design was aimed to enable a creative process, empowering \n 14 \nthose who didn\u2019t write, breaking away from textual expression and at the same \nstroke breaking the mould of artistic practice and geographical research on \nlandscape; a re-visioning of the emotional values of the Lakes and a re-imaging \nof this landscapes sensory registers, through firstly the representational art of \nparticipants in the form of their drawings and collages. These represent sensory \nvalues, materially encountered, as they evoke memories of biographical \nlandscapes not normally seen. Secondly the aim was to produce a set of images \nby a trained artist. In essence, the paintings produced by the artist, have captured \nan alternative emotional citizenry to those sensory registers canonised within \nthis cultural landscape.  \n \nThe collaboration with the artist was a necessary element of the research design. \nInitially the collaboration ensured ha there was a professional engagement with \nthe visual, having an artist present as part of the workshop design and the \nsessions themselves gave greater respectful engagement with the notion of \nvaluing the visual. Here, the artist made this process one where the participants \nwere engaged with the \u2018visual\u2019 in the form of representations that were produced \nwith attention to form, and aesthetics. The professional \u2018tome\u2019 translated the \nsessions from being about an amateurish research process where my lack of \ntraining became an obstacle. Secondly the production of a set of paintings \nentitled Nurturing Ecologies\/Maps of the Known World put these individuals\u2019 \nfeelings and values in a tangible form in a gallery space. Again this aim was a \npolitical one intended to place responses in tangible form within the cultural \neconomy of Lake District landscape representations. Some of these canvases have \nbeen bought by collections in Burnley and Lancaster and are now part of local \nmuseum displays and have been displayed in the galleries within the National \nPark itself. \n 15 \nGraham\u2019s paintings themselves, are simultaneously his own reflections, and \nreflections of others\u2019 responses; an interpretation of narratives; aesthetic and \nformal representations in aural, visual and textual modes, produced in groups. \nThese are not intended as a process of a \u2018re-appropriation\u2019 of the participants \nviews, but one where he produced a textual representation on canvas of the \nrelationships with the landscape that were shared with him, and which had \nstruck a chord in his own artistic psyche. There is a constant circulation of \nfeedback of emotions from and between individual involved in the process. The \nresult was a collaborative process between participants, Graham and I where \nparticipants were involved in exhibitions. Overall, we worked with various \nparticipants \u2013 around eighty in all, at Windermere over a period of six weeks in \nthe summer of 2004. To enable a trusting group dynamic we recruited \u2018ready \nmade\u2019 groups of people living in Lancashire and Cumbria. The first was from the \nPakistan Welfare Association (based in Burnley)which welcomed opportunities for \n\u2018activities\u2019 and \u2018trips\u2019 and was keen to be involved in something beyond research \nabout \u2018the negatives\u2019 of  race riots in Burnley in 2000-1. The recruitment meetings \nattracted around forty participants; we recruited two groups of twenty-two men \n(in age all were in their forties and fifties) and twenty-two women (all aged in \ntheir late thirties up to their mid fifties). We appointed a translator; a male and \nfemale respectively, to suit the requirements of the single sex groups. We then \nrecruited an \u2018art group\u2019 that Graham had led at a community college. The art \ngroup was a mixed group of around five men (aged of 21 to 40) and twelve \nwomen (aged 38 to 60). \n \nOur first workshop was held at Littledale Hall. Here, we had a taste of the Lake \nDistrict environment, with dining room, and a large lounge space to \naccommodate thirty people. The space provided the opportunity to enhance the \n 16 \nscope for \u2018liminality\u2019 (see Burgess, Limb and Harrison 1988a and 1988b). At \nLittledale we held two activities; we firstly asked the group about their \nbiographical relationships with past landscapes and present ones. A \u2018collective\u2019 \nbiography came through\u2013 in the Burnley group, the men and women had similar \nroutes to each other within the groups, however, the men and women had not \ntravelled together, but biographically their environments of living now, and \nthose left behind in Pakistan, were the same. The Burnley group had migrated \nfrom Gujarat in Pakistan, named after a state in India because ancestrally their \nfamilies had been ejected from Gujarat during partition. Gujarat in Pakistan lay \non the foothills of the Himalayas; a rural district made up of scores of hamlets \nwhere subsidence farming was in practice. Musafrabad was their main city, most \nrecently this city made front page news in the global media as it was the central \nsite for the organisation of food aid and rescue after the Pakistan earthquake in \nthe Himalayas in October 2005. Graham\u2019s \u2018art group\u2019 similarly had a group \nidentity based around their relationship with art. In the biography sessions man \nof the group talked through their \u2018values\u2019 of the Lakes and many complained \nthat it was difficult to escape \u2018armchair\u2019 tourism and access real landscapes or \nnature.  \n \nIn afternoon visual workshop we asked the groups to produce a visual collage of \ntheir valued landscapes. Using pictures in books, magazines such as the National \nGeographic which contained several types of landscapes located all over the world \nincluding Pakistan, India, Eastern Europe, Britain and African nations, the group \ncreated familiar landscapes. A week later the groups met again and travelled to \nWindermere. We took the groups on a short walk to Rydal Water overlooking the \nLake, we had a discussion session over coffee at Brockhole Visitors Centre, and \nthen in the afternoon we had lunch at St. Martin\u2019s College, situated at Ambleside. \n 17 \nWe had facilities for all \u2013 a prayer room, refreshments, washing facilities and a \nroom with a panoramic window overlooking Windermere. In these sessions we \nasked the groups to record (using paint and paper) their responses to their \nexperience of the Lake District. The aim was to get their responses to the \nlandscape to gain insight into how this landscape feels to the groups. \n \nWhy a visual method? What do the paintings offer? \nThe design of our methodology aimed to enhance the possibilities for \nmultivocality. Halliday (2000) argues that innovative visual methodologies can \ncounter the traditional power dynamics of other methods, but require continued \nreflection on whether their aim is to \u2018further legitimate the truth of the research \nitself.\u2019 (p504). Pink (2001), in response, argues for reflexive modes of representing \nparticipant \u2018voices\u2019. Here, the images are situated within a biographical context \n(both in my own papers and in the gallery space in the form of a poster) and the \nprocess of production is outlined as transparently as is possible. The images \nrepresent the way people experience the Lake District landscape and the \nassumption here is that seeing is embodied, figured through our cultural lens \nthrough which we experience environment. We cannot \u2018see\u2019 and \u2018feel\u2019 separately, \nmy argument here is that aesthetics in representations are about emotions as \nmuch as they are about form, visual grammars permeate with visceral narrations \nof embodied values. In the picturesque tradition, as a \u2018see-er\u2019 you were \ncommanding the landscape, however, everyday landscape experience does not \nembody such a powerful positioning, this is where \u2018embodied\u2019 seeing can be the \nonly way to make sense of cultures of experiencing landscape. We do not simply \nfeel as context to seeing, but see through an embodied, feeling engagement. This \nis why these images are about \u2018feeling\u2019 as much as they are about representation, \nnarration or the geopolitics of being English and other in a space of narrating the \n 18 \nnational cultural sensibility. Kearnes (2000) supports this further - \u2018one does not \nsimply see . . . objects and phenomena are seeable or visible . . . in machinic \ncombination with discourses, knowledges and spaces\u2019 (p335). The paintings, \nwhen exhibited do function as representations, but as a re-visioning of a national \niconography through multiple sensory encounters, not normally visualised on \ncanvas. It has been important to design the visual workshops to maximise \nparticipation; not to delimit responses through the use of formal English. Visual \nmethods that are designed to include discussions in multiple languages offer a \nmeans of \u2018triangulation\u2019 of methods in the case of the Burnley group this allowed \nthe space to be owned by those speaking Urdu, Punjabi or Hindi. This move \ntowards working in a multilingual space beyond \u2018English\u2019 opened up the \npossibility for forging more even relationships within the group, and making the \n\u2018doing\u2019 of art and painting possible. The use of art materials served to contribute \nto forcing the groups to work beyond their normal formal grammars and \ncommunications about landscape. The paints and paper allowed us to attempt to \nset up activities which were about capturing alternative vocabularies and visual \ngrammars that are not always encountered or expressible in oral interviews. In \nprevious research it has been difficult to get usually more conservative South \nAsian groups to talk about abstract environmental values. he process of \nabstracting \u2018environmental values\u2019, \u2018emotional values\u2019 and \u2018aesthetic responses\u2019 \nwas assisted by being at Windermere and through the visual and physical \npractice; including the unusual physical actions of using hands, fingers and arms \ndifferently to the day-to-day (Bingley, 2003). \n \nAlthough there are disadvantages to using my particular visual methodology in \nthe ways that I have outlined, I resolved to stick with the format that I designed. \nMy research focus has always been about visual representations as the landscape \n 19 \ntradition in Europe has been figured through these cultures of representation, \nother methodologies such as photography, and auto-ethnographic approaches to \nembodied landscape practice do offer alternative routes, but for me the critical \nnotion of \u2018positioning\u2019 is better explored in the group process, and he production \nof an exhibition of works at the end of the research was also critical. In practical \nterms problems included getting people relaxed enough to paint can be a \npsychological mine field. We avoided problems in this regard in the recruitment \nprocess; we chose ready-made art-groups or those enthusiastic about the method \nitself. Even after these precautions were taken the methodology was still difficult \nas encouraging people to paint, or draw, or to talk about landscape and \nemotions, inevitably is. The Burnley men were particularly resistant; some felt \nembarrassed and regarded \u2018doing art\u2019 as \u2018feminine\u2019 and did not represent \n\u2018modernity\u2019. Thus some men were wary of being associated with something \n\u2018rustic\u2019. Graham took photographs and assisted \u2013 some directed him mix colors, \nothers to draw and paint objects that they had struggled with. The sessions were \nrecorded; together these visual and aural texts formed the basis to Graham\u2019s \npaintings. Forty were produced over eighteen months from September 2004 to \nApril 2006. Within this period there were four gallery exhibitions including at the \nDuke\u2019s Theatre Gallery (2004); Townley Hall Museum Gallery in Burnley; the \u2018Fear\u2019 \nconference held at the University of Durham, and the Theatre by the Lake, Keswick. \nIn the next section I want to analyse the meanings embedded in these paintings.  \n \nRe-presenting emotional geographies of the park: interpretations on canvas \nPlate Two \u2013 Isolation \nPlate Three - Safe in dark places \nPlate Four - Fear of high places \n \n 20 \nThese three images are examples of a counter-landscape aesthetic formed by \nGraham Lowe in his interpretations of the group\u2019s responses. In this section I \nhave reflected Graham\u2019s explanation of the production of this set of images. The \npaintings produced were created using a soft pastel and liquid acrylic. His aim \nwas to produce small intimate images (32 cm squared).which would help to \nexpress the emotions being discussed in the group sessions. He was aiming to \nexpress something of the response of the participants in the groups to the \nlandscape. In Graham\u2019s view, the canvas itself \u2018creates a site for the imagination\u2019, \na place in which, perhaps the viewer\u2019s emotions may be garnered and indeed \nmirrored. At the exhibition in Lancaster some of the viewers discussed fear, and \nanxiety when viewing the paintings \u2018isolation\u2019 and \u2018remembered landscape\u2019. \nThey resonated with them through the form and palette. For Graham the \nmaterial that he had to work with in different forms - on audio tapes and the \nmaterials from the workshops \u2013 was overwhelming at first. Graham decided to \nwork almost entirely from the transcripts to get some depth of understanding of \nthe statements which resonated with him. \n \nIsolation is based on Boris. In the workshop he compared the LDNP to the area in \nwhich he lives; the outskirts of a small village a landscape of isolation and \nanxiety. A landscape in which there is space to reflect. He says \u201aYou can\u2019t get \naway from yourself, you are faced with yourself, and there is a lack of diversions. \nIf you are emotionally or psychologically in a bad place all sorts of fears and \nanxieties come up\u201b. In an interview about the painting, Graham states that in it \u2018I \nhave tried to capture the essence of his statement\u2019, to do this, within the painting \nthere are no trees, no landmarks, and no points of reference. Boris talked of his \nfears and anxieties which as he put it, \u201acame up\u201b during his visit to Windermere. \nThe marks at the bottom reflect the \u2018rising up\u2019 of these anxieties- \u201arising up like \n 21 \nbubbles in a glass\u201b. Boris\u2019s fear is caused by being in the landscape, this is a \ncatalyst to his facing his own anxieties, and he cannot escape these when he is in \nthis space. Boris, in this encounter is not engaged with a \u2018national\u2019 landscape, his \nexperience is counter to that of Lorraine\u2019s followers and different to usual \nresponses to Turner\u2019s popular scenes. His claustrophobia is encountered as an \nindividual emotion in the landscape of the Lakes. He is sensitized and fearful \nwhen the landscape is bare, un-peopled and non-utilitarian. \n \nIn his painting Safe in Dark Places Graham reflects on Sam\u2019s comments on how he \nfelt safer in the dark places of the lakes, in the forests. He loves tree roots, the \nrocks, and mosses \u201athe grubby, spotty spaces\u201b. Sam feels fear of the open spaces, \nwhen in the open, he feels unanchored, vulnerable to attack. In the painting the \nlight area is surrounded on three sides by a dark border. The object in the centre \nliterally the grubby spotty, space, appears to be three dimensional, a container. \nThis is like a womb like space with a life-line, an umbilical chord that links him \nto the outside world like a tree root. This is for Sam the place in which to feel \nsafe. This painting is made reflecting Sam\u2019s own picture, which is a dark, black \nmass of paint with little colour or lines. On seeing this image the group \nresponded with shock and surprise at his response to the paradisiacal beauty of \nthe surrounding landscape. Sam craved the safety of enclosure, the safety of \norganic matter away from an objective perspective over vistas and panoramas of \nthe Lakeland fells. The scale of the landscape to which he retreats, reflects his \nfeelings of safety in the usually unseen textures of soil, branches, bark and moss, \nat ground level of landscape encounter - the soil that is not often seen, or looked-\nfor in trips to the Lakes is a picture of safety. \n  \n 22 \nIn Fear of High Places Graham has reflected on the discussion he had with the \nBurnley women at Windermere. Many expressed their delight at the \nsurroundings; describing it as a landscape of paradise. In response to this Graham \nsuggested taking them to the top of \u2018Kirkstone pass\u2019 with a steep view of the \nvalley. The women\u2019s group became visibly anxious and without exception \nrefused to go. The group experienced collective anxiety. The interpreter stated \nthat they were \u201aafraid to venture into a high wilderness landscape\u201b. The group\u2019s \nanxiety was evident from their body language and the tone of their \nconversations. In Graham\u2019s painting he interprets this fear as a barrier blocking \ntheir access into these high places. The women fear the very type of landscape \nwalking that Wylie (2005) embarks upon. The physical act of walking the open \npathways is a frightful prospect and reflects a counter to the (usually) \nmasculinist (Nash, 1996) impulses to conquer views from the highest viewing \npoint. The women were comfortable at low ground, in a group, and in a social \ngroup experience of this landscape. Yasmin describes being completely \noverwhelmed by the mountains \u201aI felt very small isolated and fearful in these \nsurroundings\u201b In this painting Graham has tried to express these feelings in the \nuse of composition and color. The mainly dark shape dominates the picture \nplain, with a dark and brooding sky above. The only relief from the somber \ncolors is the yellow area to the right which reflects my observations of the ever \nchanging light in mountain landscapes. Here, the \u2018awe\u2019 inspired by this \npicturesque landscape is experienced as terror in Yasmin\u2019s account; the very act \nof viewing and picturing the scene engenders fright. This is again counter to the \n18th century practice of seeing beauty and awe in the majesty of these mountains. \n \nInitially Graham found creating this body of work to be extremely challenging. \nCreating paintings which originated in discussions was novel. Also working \n 23 \nwith other\u2019s whose experience of landscape was often very different than his \nown, was stimulating but also stirred up emotions that he himself wasn\u2019t \nexpecting; working with \u00e9migr\u00e9s and poverty stricken migrants from rural \nPakistan was heart wrenching. It took a while for Graham to settle with a style, \nto find a way of producing successful images that would engage with the viewer \nand create a dialogue which expressed something of the emotions that were \ndiscussed in the groups. As a set of images they represent landscapes that are far \nfrom the \u2018picturesque\u2019 mode of Lorraine\u2019s art. They have an everydayness of \nemotions such as \u2018fear\u2019, \u2018awe\u2019, \u2018terror\u2019 and \u2018pain\u2019. The paintings encompass a \npedestrian visual grammar of landscape informed by training in abstract art; \nlines and block color, renders them intimate, immediate and accessible. The \naudience is invited to reflect on the emotional landscape and respond to the \nembedded registers of fear; some may reject these paintings as \u2018craft\u2019 on the basis \nof this very distinction between these \u2018ways of seeing\u2019 or due to their genealogy \ncompared to Lorraine\u2019s own canvases. \n \nLocating the fear of Paradise \nThere is a relationship between emotional registers and landscape culture that is \nshaping the politics of identity and cultures of landscape simultaneously. In \nunderstanding the moral geographies of landscapes such as the English Lake \nDistrict we need not simply attend to the matter of \u2018adding emotions\u2019 to existing \naccounts. Instead my aim is to show how the feelings that mobility affords - \nfreedom, connection and disconnection, new opportunities for self-expression, \nloneliness, and family stress\u2013are implicated in the experiential texture of \ntransnational experiences. My premise here is that the emotional dimensions of \ntransnational mobility shape experiences of place. Tracing these may bring us \nsome way towards understanding, recording and critically reflecting on cultures \n 24 \nof landscape and post-migration citizenship. As Davidson and Bondi (2004) \nreflect,  \n \n\u201aWhether joyful or heartbreaking, emotion has the power to transfer the shape of \nour life-worlds . . Creating new fissures and textures we never expected to find\u201b \n(Davidson and Bondi, 2004) \n \nThe research is within the realms of cultural and moral geographies of the \nEnglish Landscape, aimed at advancing the research being conducted on \nenvironmental values held by migratory groups in Britain. This is an issue of \nincreasing importance in an age of increasing migration, displacement and \nmobility from those not deemed \u2018local\u2019. More recently Mitchell (2001) has argued \nthat embedded in cultures of national identity there is a \u2018lure of the local\u2019. It  \n \n\u201ais not a lure of myths through which people make sense of their own lives, but \nthe lure of mythologies through which power is consolidated and solidified, and \nthe project of racism is advanced\u201b (p277)  \n \nThe Burnley group\u2019s perceptions of the Lake District landscape, reveals a \n\u2018relational\u2019 valuing of this fecund \u2018paradise\u2019 against the oppressive, ecologically \nbarren, and economically denuded Burnley city landscape. Through including \nthese experiences as part of my interpretation, I aim to enrich the research \nprocess and in turn provide a \u2018whole\u2019 picture, rather than reducing the minority \nethnic experience as always being relational to their urban social life. The \ncommunities\u2019 valuing of the landscape of Gujarat in Pakistan are also embedded \nin their responses to the Lake District National Park \u2013 through memory. The \nBurnley women\u2019s fear resonated with their lack of \u2018know-how\u2019 in this \n 25 \nenvironment, they felt disorientated by the new landscape, unknown to them. \nExperiences of fear were present in their own \u2018community\u2019 space, yet a desire for \nenfranchisement was less in a space that represented for them a \u2018fear of high \nplaces\u2019. Their sentiments troubled me, as this group had lived in the Himalayan \nfoothills, their \u2018high places\u2019 were one-hundred fold higher and steeper. The \nBurnley group within the landscape of the Himalayas were not carrying a \nportmanteau of lost dreams and lives \u2013 the women in the session recollect their \nmixed feelings about living in Britain \u201awe stay for our children\u201b is a common \nclaim. Many of the women in their paintings described lush kitchen-gardens in \nPakistan, where they lived in a cultivated landscape. They describe the ease of \nmoving through this landscape, whereas in the UK they are shut in \u2013 as the space \naround is not solely for their kith and kin they risk being suspected of dishonour \nmore easily if seen without their spouse. Since many of the women have lost \ntheir husbands to respiratory illnesses and heart disease (as a result of poor \nworking conditions in the mill factories), they have little choice but to stay at \nhome, with children. Their fear in the Lakes reflected physical insecurities in \nunfamiliar surroundings; a lack of Halal food, prayer rooms, water, distance \nfamiliarity and racism were all stated as contributing to their fears. Their \nincongruity was also a source of anxiety to them, however, this is not limited to \nWindermere but extends to Nelson and Burnley too. Racism was constantly \nreferred to in the group conversations. On reading the Burnley landscape it was \neasy to see that the women had been isolated further since the riots, their \nalienation and oppression had increased. Many of their drawings show dark \nrooms, with windows looking out. These women felt despondent about their \nchildren\u2019s future. The Burnley men too found it difficult although they did not \neasily talk about the past \u2013 a rural life in the villages \u2013 but they were even more \nsilent on their present lives. At home they had difficulty filling their days; with \n 26 \nlimited possibilities of work they attended the community centre to read \nnewspapers and attend the luncheon club. In Burnley the Asians certainly \nexperience fear for the future welfare of their community and racist violence. \nAhmed (2004a; 2004b) argues for the imperatives of racial violence to be \nunderstood as emotionally driven, her argument focuses on the collectivity of \nemotional imperatives for both sides of the race line.  \n \n\u201awe can consider racism as a particular form of inter-corporeal encounter: a \nwhite racist subject who encounters a racial other may experience an intensity of \nemotions (fear, hate, disgust, pain). That intensification involves moving away \nfrom the body of the other, or moving towards that body in an act of \nviolence\u201b(Ahmed, 2004b) \n \nFor the Bunley community corporeal engagements with landscape are constantly \nfigured through racialised, geopolitical positionings, the fear expressed here \nreflect their pormanteau of the way their landscape experiences are transposed \nelsewhere. However, their registers of fear are just one element of the fears that \nhe Lake District landscape evokes in the participants. Differential registers for \n\u2018fear\u2019 are critical here; Sam\u2019s experience of fear resonates with collective social \nfears about attack and vulnerability, but his fear isn\u2019t about a transpersonal, \naffective experience. Sam feared open spaces because he felt a physical \nvulnerability from violence, as an individual, he is terrified of personal attack. \nFor him the awesome landscape did not present a fear of a \u2018sublime\u2019 landscape; \nhis sublime was in the details of close inspection of woodland, tracing patterns in \nthe mosses, bark, and humus on the ground. Sam describes his joy on \nencountering micro-scale landscape \n \n 27 \n\u201aWell incidental, they\u2019re incidental joys I always think because they\u2019re there just \ndoing they\u2019re thing. They\u2019re not there for our benefit. They\u2019re just being and the \njoy that we get from witnessing it is an incidental joy. I seem to be the only \nperson that really enjoyed the dark places, found them safe. I do, do dark things. \n. . I zoomed in on sort of square foot underneath the bottom of a tree.\u201b \n \nSam\u2019s joy is operating on different registers of excitement, exhilaration that the \ncomment \u201ayou have brought me to heaven\u201b was inspired by, the scale of joy, the \nlocation of the experience and understandings alone are not sufficient to think \nthrough the value of \u2018joyous\u2019 spaces in this landscape. I would argue that there is \na need to retheorise affectual registers through lens of understanding the \npositioning of the body that experiences these emotions. Emotional registers \nshape landscape and geographies of identification. By considering the social \nexperiences of empowerment, occlusion, marginality, transnationalism, and \nalienation we can develop a nuanced approach to varied affectual geographies; \ntreating registers of affect as multilayered occurrences of \u2018fear\u2019 and \u2018joy\u2019. \nSensitivity towards vernacular landscapes and power geometries, can only \nenrich current landscape research. \n \nConclusion \nThis paper is a reflection on the expression of fear, terror, and anxiety as \ngarnered in the Nurturing Ecologies research project and the resulting \nrepresentations on the canvases produced by the artist Graham Lowe. These \nmake tangible the alternative sensibilities that this landscape engenders in varied \n\u2018English\u2019 folk visiting this space; \u2018other\u2019 British folk, with a right to peaceful \nenjoyment. It has been really important to record various responses to the \nEnglish Lake District, despite my reservations about situating \u2018cultures\u2019 as \n 28 \nbounded, geographical and social frames, these do serve as a starting point for \ngenealogical research that uncovers lost or hidden voices. The canvases are a set \nof the visualisations of landscape cultures in the Lake District, these have been a \nresponse to historical and canonised narrations. In this regard I have also sought \nto trouble the affectual approach to social science research, by insisting that \u2018race\u2019 \nand power figure in the possibilities of affectual encounter, but also form social \nidentities and in turn, social landscapes (Hemmings, 2005). The Burnley group \nexperience the LDNP as a \u2018sublime\u2019 landscape that reflects God\u2019s work on Earth; \ntheir feelings cultivated through religious values rooted in the Quoran. The \nlandscape of the Lakes remains a place of sensory engagement \u2013 joyful and \nfearful, however understanding these affective registers as figured through \nsocially contextual power geometries enhances the value of geographies of \nemotion and affect. Understanding emotions in different registers linked to \n\u2018structures of feeling\u2019 shaped by an national moral politics allow us to increase \nunderstandings of 21st century English sensibilities including those experienced \nby the \u2018mobile\u2019 English, migrants, and communities of visitors that form the \nmaelstrom of material practices that carve out the modern Lake District \nexperience. Wordsworth in his own guide to the Lake District describes it as \nbeing \u2018a sort of national property, in which every man has a right and an interest \nwho has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy\u2019 (quoted in Matless, 1998, p251). \nThis right continues to be struggled over, not simply in terms of access, but in \nterms of what possibilities of engagement a national culture of landscape could \nallow. If \u2018national culture\u2019 was to be determined through a broader lens of what \nconstitutes \u2018national landscape\u2019, Wordsworth\u2019s humanistic utopianism could be \nafforded to all of today\u2019s visitor encounters who experience various registers of \nterror, fear, and joy. \n 29 \nReferences \n \nAgyeman, J. 1990. \u201aBlack People In A White Landscape: Social And \nEnvironmental Justice.\u201b Built Environment 16:232-236. \n \nAhmed, S. 2004a. \u201aCollective Feelings: or the Impressions Left by Others\u201b Theory, \nCulture And Society 21:25-42. \n \nAhmed, S. 2004b. \u2018Affective Economies\u2019 Social Text, 22(2) P117-139 \n \nAnderson, K.
