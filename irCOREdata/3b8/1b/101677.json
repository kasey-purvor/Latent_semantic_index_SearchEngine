Initially the idea of critical tourism is addressed in two ways. First an array of \nmeanings is exposed from which the idea of critical theory is developed. Next discussion \nturns to how critical approaches can contribute to good management and governance of \ntourism by providing understandings that technical rationality can overlook. Finally the \nlimited extent of critical tourism research is established. The article concludes that tourism \nshould be a critical business and offers pointers for such an agenda. For although positivist \nresearch informed by technical rationality is crucial to the better operational management of \ntourism, critical research is essential for setting an agenda for ethical management, \ngovernance and co-existence with the wider world. Indeed it is critical to deep, long term \nsustainability and even the survival of tourism.  Keywords: critical theory, ideology, power, \ngovernance. \n \nIntroduction \nBarnett\u2019s (1990:71) critique of higher education provides the rationale for this article. In it he \nnoted that higher education: \nproduces technicist, managerial and economic ideologies for \nsociety; and it produces critical ideologies - e.g. ecological, \nfeminist, deconstructionalist and humanistic ideologies - \nconsciously counterpoised against the former set. \n \nBarnett was alluding to a dualism evident in higher education with management and \nengineering schools on one side and departments of sociology, philosophy and cultural \nstudies on the other side. To caricature the situation, the former can produce highly \nemployable but largely uncritical compliant human resources whilst the latter can produce \nhighly critical, non-compliant human resources with limited employability skills. This article \nwishes to seek synthesis and practical engagement with both sides of this dichotomy by \npresenting the case that tourism ought to be a more critical business. Its main aim is to \nidentify a research and practice gap in critical tourism research and practice and consider the \nimplications of this. This aim gives rise to three objectives. First it is necessary to clarify the \nmeaning of critical tourism research. Second an analysis of the contribution of critical \napproaches to management and governance is undertaken. Third the limited deployment of \ncritical tourism research to date is empirically demonstrated. The main part of the article is \ndivided into three sections in line with these objectives. Initially the idea of critical tourism is \nreviewed. Next the importance of critical approaches for the management and governance of \ntourism is discussed. Finally the extent of criticality in tourism research is interrogated.  \n \nIn terms of the contribution of this paper, whilst there has been some limited discussion in the \nliterature of the idea of critical tourism, no interrogation of the extent of critical tourism or its \nimportance for the business of tourism has been previously undertaken. Several researchers \n(Swain, Brent and Long 1988: Kim 1998 and Xiao and Smith 2006) have offered various \ntypes of content analysis of tourism journals. Their deployment of content analysis has \nconcentrated on what is present and operated at the level of topics and subjects. They have \nusefully identified significant themes and plotted changes in these (amongst other things). In \n 2 \ncontrast this article is looking for absences (specifically of critical theory) and is searching at \nthe level of methodology. In doing so it surfaces issues not found in these previous works \nwhilst offering a deeper inspection of criticality than that offered by Riley and Love\u2019s (2000) \nimportant work on qualitative and quantitative approaches. Additionally its use of the \nCABABS data base offers a new method of data mining. \n \nThe Concept of Critical Tourism \nIs tourism research critical? When examining this question we are immediately faced with a \nproblem. The term critical has several meanings and so it is important to clarify the particular \nmeaning to be used in this discussion. One typical definition posits critical as a special (or \neven the top) category of importance where failure to understand and act may result in an \nirretrievable loss. Hence we have critical illness, etc. Tourism research is surely critical in \nthis sense since it encompasses issues such as critical success factors (Brotherton 2004) and \ncritical incident analysis (Ravenscroft and Rogers 2003). Another meaning of critical is based \naround the notions of close scrutiny of the facts, looking for weaknesses and faults and \noffering judgement. Again there are many examples of such research in tourism ranging from \nanalysis of consumer satisfaction and destination quality to evaluation of sustainable \npractices. Both of these usages of the term are familiar to those in the tourism industry. But \nneither reflects the precise use of the term for this article where discussion will engage in the \nmore specialised and technical meaning of the term as deployed in the concept of critical \ntheory. \n \nCritical theory is the research paradigm developed by the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, \nAdorno, Marcuse and Habermas). Critical theory traces its intellectual roots to Marx, Hegel \nand beyond and its meaning emerges by reference to its difference from other research \nparadigms. Typically studies into research methodology classify research approaches into \nbetween three and five paradigms. These encompass positivism (and post-positivism), \ninterpretivism (and constructionism) and critical theory.  \n \nThere are several key features of the positivist research paradigm. Most crucially it \nconcentrates on positive data - that is on facts that can be verifiable and can survive attempts \nat falsification (Popper 1975). To underpin positivism, rigorous scientific method is used, \nbased upon hypothesis formulation, and testing against empirical evidence. Quantitative \nmeasurement and experiment are the key techniques of positivism and quality control is \ngoverned by the need to survive falsifiability and demonstrate validity, reliability and value-\nneutrality. Whilst positivism assumes the existence of an objective reality that can be \nempirically observed, post-positivism (Guba 1990) is more reflexive and allows for a less \ncertain view of reality - one that \u201ccan never be fully apprehended, only incompletely \nunderstood\u201d (Hollinshead 2004:76). However it holds that there is a sufficient basis (a \npractical adequacy) for useful investigation whilst conceding that fallibility in observation \ncalls for underpinning by triangulation. \n \nThe interpretive paradigm seeks understanding and meaning arguing that human actions and \nsocial constructs cannot be treated by researchers in the same way as natural objects. Here, \nunderstanding and meaning in tourism are sought by reference to its participants for it is their \nvoice which interpretivist research wishes to catch. In this way participants in interpretivist \nresearch are \u201cregarded as subjects, not objects\u201d (Grundy 1987:69). Grundy seeks to highlight \nthe positivist power relations of researcher-as-subject and researched-as-object. Under \ninterpretivism the researched should be promoted to subject and be offered more power of \nauthorship. Research findings should be written to minimise the pre-conceived ideas of the \n 3 \nresearcher and maximise collaboration and dialogue. This is in contrast to positivism which \nobjectifies the researched world so that the understanding of the world may become boxed-in \nby the meanings which have been ascribed from the researcher\u2019s preconceptions and which \npermeate the research instrument. Significant truths arise from positivism but their extent can \nbe limited by the aperture provided by the researcher and research instrument (Tribe 2006). \nThe research techniques used under the interpretive approach include unstructured \ninterviews, focus groups, participant observation, case studies, hermeneutics, literary \ncriticism, and emics. \n \nTable 1: Aspects of Critical Theory (based on Kincheloe and McLaren, 2003) \nDomain Objective Potential Proxy Terms \n1.

Italics denote repeated word \n*       denotes that the proxy term uses the \u201cwild symbol\u201d of an asterisk in the search to pick up its various forms. \n \nTo some extent constructionism finds itself bridging the paradigms of interpretivism and \ncritical theory. On the one hand, Berger & Luckman\u2019s (1966) The Social Construction of \n 4 \nReality underlines the importance of interpretivist methods in portraying reality. On the other \nhand Burr (1995) and Delanty (1997) discuss some key issues of constructionism which \nmove us towards critical theory. These issues include the critical stance towards taken for \ngranted knowledge and understandings that knowledge is historically and culturally specific, \nthat knowledge is sustained by social practices and that knowledge and social action are \ninterlinked. \n \nCritical theory largely shares these considerations but distinguishes itself from \nconstructionism in a number of key ways. Kincheloe and McLaren (2003) enumerate the \nmajor concerns of critical theory and these are illustrated in table one which organises them \naround eleven domains. These domains and their associated objectives are now discussed. \n \nA key distinguishing feature of critical theory is its interest in critical enlightenment (domain \none) particularly in relation to power relations. Indeed a main consideration is its wish to \nexpose the interests which are associated with different research paradigms. Habermas\u2019s \n(1978) contribution is important here, particularly his theory of knowledge-constitutive \ninterests, where he concludes that there is no interest-free knowledge. For example in \nKnowledge and Human Interests he argues that knowledge derived from positivist \nmethodology generally serves technical interests \u2013 in particular those of management and \ncontrol and the finding of technical solutions to problems. This concentration on technical \nsolutions takes the current ordering of things as given whereas for critical theory the current \nordering of things is deliberately foregrounded as a possible problem. Power is a fundamental \nissue to be researched and a critical approach to tourism would seek to expose whose \ninterests are served and how power operates in particular formations of tourism as well as in \nthe process of research. However Kincheloe and McLaren (2003:437) also explain that \ncritical theory rejects crude forms of economic determinism (domain two) and rather posits \nthat there are \u201cmultiple forms of power.\u201d The post-structuralist concepts of ideology and \ndiscourse are therefore found to be more relevant to critical tourism than structuralist \nexplanations based on simple economic determinism.  \n \nThe next goal of critical theory is its interest in emancipation (domain three). This is \ndescribed by Grundy (1987:99) as leading to a \u201ctransformation in the way in which one \nperceives and acts in the world\u201d. The emancipation which is sought here is action which \nresults in a move to a better production and consumption of tourism. In other words critical \ntheory entertains ideas about utopia and the good life for tourism with a particular emphasis \nin unleashing human agency and autonomy.  \n \nIn response to this domain four develops a critique of technical rationality and the latter\u2019s \nfocus on means rather than ends and demonstrates how in this respect critical theory differs \nfrom positivism. Positivism espouses value freedom, excluding questions of a moral or \nethical nature which cannot be settled by an appeal to facts. It thereby rules out consideration \nof what might or ought to be in favour of what is so that only means, facts and theory remain. \nIn contrast critical theory deliberately seeks to engage with normative questions of values and \ndesirable ends. In particular as Young (1989:2) observes a key concern of critical theorists is \nthat the \u201csociety which exists is only an imperfect representation of what it could be.\u201d Critical \ntheory wishes to engage in the process which Hegel referred to as the authorship of history \nand Gibson (1986:37) explains that for critical theory: \nknowledge and interest in emancipation coincide and thus make \nfor those unities which positivism severs - theory and practice, \n 5 \nmeans and ends, thought and action, fact and value, reason and \nemotion. \n \nA further aspect of critical theory is an understanding of the embodiment of the researcher \nand researched (domain five) and indeed an admission of first person reporting in research \nwhere positivism insists on third person distancing of the researcher in their reportage. In this \nway identity, libido and emotion are considered as part of a complex set of factors that can \ninfluence research and therefore deserve reflexive recognition in along with issues of \nrationality and power. \n \nCritical theory also sets itself apart from interpretivism for one important reason. It does not \nnecessarily trust the accounts of the researched to give a true reading of the world. It is wary \nof the possibility of their false (or at the very least, not fully engaged) consciousness and their \ninability to escape the knowledge-conventions of their epoch or culture. For example when \nwitchcraft was an accepted explanation of human activity interpretivist research would have \nresulted in rich accounts of the phenomenon without necessarily challenging the concept. \nBarnett (2003:56) describes false consciousness as the situation where \u201cthat which is \ncontingent is seen as inevitable. That which is iniquitous is seen as just. That which is \nimposed is seen as natural.\u201d For this reason ideology (domain six) is central to critical theory. \n \nIdeology is a term that has two distinct meanings. First it refers to an overarching network of \nguiding ideas that frame, direct and inform thinking. Marx and Engels (1845:53) were \nimportant in developing the concept of ideology and they identify the ruling ideology is the \nideology of the dominant class.  \n \nThe ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling \nideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of \nsociety, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The \nclass which has the means of material production at its disposal \nhas control at the same time over the means of mental \nproduction, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of \nthose who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. \n \nIdeology\u2019s second meaning describes discrete, coherent belief systems. The list of such \nideologies is long, ranging from political systems e.g. communism, through idea systems e.g. \npantheism, utilitarianism (Mill and Sher 2002), liberalism (Hayek 1978) and Confucianism to \nreligious faiths e.g. Judaeo-Christianity, Mohammedism and Hinduism. Here, an ideology is \na system of beliefs that directs the policies and activities of its adherents. Ideology then, \nframes thought and guides action and its presence may lead to the suppression and partial \nexclusion of other world views. But the operation of an ideology can remain hidden from \nview, for the deeply embedded nature and long tradition of a particular ideology can serve to \ncamouflage its existence. Apple (1990:5) explains how ideology \"saturates our very \nconsciousness\" so that it becomes the taken for granted way of thinking and doing. It \nbecomes the accepted or common sense view of the world. The job of critical theory is to \nidentify ideological influences at work and Habermas deployed ideology critique as a method \nof identification of ideology and a possible means of escape from ideology. Critique \nencourages self-understanding and the placing of any representation of the world in \ncompetition with other possible views of the world.  \n \n 6 \nIt is suggested that the underlying dominant common-sense view (ideology) which permeates \nmuch literature, research and activity in tourism is materialism. Its guiding idea is that \ntourism should be organised to bring profit to the organising company and satisfaction to the \npaying tourist. This is the common-sense background in which much tourism research \noperates. Moreover it operates without much consciousness or critical scrutiny of this \nideology. This ideology promotes particular kinds of knowledge favouring marketing, \nmeasurement, management and planning and whilst there are signs of questioning \ncomponents (sustainability, environmental impacts) they are often as adjuncts to the main \nthrust of the (uncritical) business of tourism. Gramsci\u2019s (1971) concept of hegemony (domain \nseven) offers a more subtle re-working of the Marxist reading of ideology. Gramsci does not \nhold with the view that there is an explicit, conscious imposition of one ideology by one \ngroup on a range of unwilling groups but rather that ideologies are negotiated. \n \nA more subtle and distributed exercise of power is illustrated in the Foulcauldian (Foucault \n1971; 1974; 1980) notion of discourse (domain eight). Here the constructive power of \nlanguage is revealed. Hall (1997:44) describes a discourse as \"a group of statements which \nprovide a language for talking about ...a particular topic at a particular historical \nmoment.\"  Foucault was interested in the rules and practices that gave statements meaning \nand in turn regulated what could be said. He illustrated this by a study of how madness came \nto be constructed out of such discourses. In particular discursive formations perform a \nselector function by legitimising what counts as knowledge and what does not. Discourses \nthereby regulate the bounds of the sayable and discourses of managerialism and \nsustainability, amongst others, may be discerned in tourism research. \n \nCritical theory also foregrounds the controlling aspects of culture. Here Kincheloe and \nMcLaren (2003:436) consider the ways in which mass contemporary culture (domain nine) \ncan contribute to the situation where \u201c \u2026individuals \u2026 have been acculturated to feel \ncomfortable in relations of domination and subordination rather than equality and \nindependence.\u201d In tourism guide books, brochures, adverts, postcards and travel sections in \nthe media are often complicit in portraying an uncritical, idealised, untroubled world of \ntourism (Jaworski and Pritchard 2005). Examples include the plane as a symbol of escape and \nempowerment rather than of pollution: the five star hotel as the ultimate in luxury rather than \na symbol of social class and division and the developing world as the playground of the \nexotic other rather than a site of development and self determination. Kincheloe and \nMcClaren (2003) also point to pedagogical practices (domain ten) as being implicated in and \ncontributing to the production of \u201chegemonic ways of seeing\u201d. \n \nSumming up the key features of critical theory (domain eleven) Best (1997:ix) explains its \nrole as follows: \nRejecting the positivist dichotomy between fact and value, \ntheory and politics, critical theory interrogates the \"is\" in terms \nof the \"ought,\" seeking to grasp the emancipatory possibilities \nof the current society as something that can and should be \nrealized in the future. It thereby gains a leverage for normative \ncriticism and \"utopian\" projection by analyzing the social \nforces that constrain and inhibit the realization of human \npotentialities for greater freedom, social justice and solidarity, \nas well as a harmonious relation with the natural world, while \nenvisaging the new social forms and sensibilities required to \nenable and realize these possibilities. \n 7 \n \nCritical tourism, management and governance \nThe following section offers a more practical examination of the potential significance of \ncritical approaches for the management and governance of tourism. Under the heading of \nmanagement, issues of criticality are considered in relation to the specific issues of managing \na tourism site. This is done through a discussion of the management of the contested site of \nUluru in Australia. Under the heading of governance issues of criticality are considered in \nrelation to the political environment in which tourism operates as well as issues of planning \nand control. \n \nManagement \nThe importance of critical theory can be illustrated by analysing the way in which Uluru \/ \nAyers Rock is understood, (re)presented and managed for tourism using managerialism as a \npoint of critique. Managerialism is an example of an ideology that privileges business \nmanagement over other ways of managing and elevates profitability as the key end for \nappropriate action. Under such a view the management of Ayers Rock becomes a technical \nissue covering aspects such as crowd control, health and safety, consumer satisfaction, \nefficient supply of services geared towards profitability \u2013 all of which generate research \nagendas. \n \nBut critical theory points up the fact that Uluru is a highly contested space where the \nlocalised, deep-rooted aspirations of the indigenous population come into sharp play with the \ndemands of global, post-modern tourists. A starting point when considering the place is of \ncourse its name, since the use of name discloses a bundle of pre-conceptions and associations \nabout the place. Indeed it might be argued that in semiotic terms \u201cAyers Rock\u201d signifies the \nplace as a tourist attraction for pleasure and self-fulfilment whilst \u201cUluru\u201d signifies it as an \naboriginal homeland with deep traditions and cultural practices to be respected. A brief \nreview of some of the research literature on Ayers Rock \/ Uluru helps to further clarify the \nimplications of different research paradigms for its management. \n \nFor example, McIntyre and Boag (1995) examined the relationship between visitor density \nand perceptions of crowding at Uluru National Park and the effect of these perceptions on the \nlevel of visitor satisfaction. Two sites where investigated - the Uluru Climb and Malaku \nWilytja. A critical theorist would cite this as an example of the use of instrumental reason and \nresearch to serve technical interests. In this case the research issue is objectified by the \nresearcher. The issue and approach has been imposed (wittingly or unwittingly) upon the \nplace \u2013 a western environmental discourse for the management of tourism problem. The \nstatus quo is taken for granted. The aim of the research is perhaps to understand visitor \nsatisfaction and perhaps to find ways of better management of overcrowding. But there is no \nattempt to understand the issues of the place (interpretivism) or to understand the cultural \nconstruction of knowledge about Uluru (constructionism) or the power\/knowledge and \nideological issues (critical theory) infused in tourism in Ayers Rock \/ Uluru. Similar \ncomments would apply to Fielding, Pearce, and Hughes\u2019 (1992) study into the relationship \nbetween individual differences in motivation and the experience of climbing Ayers Rock. \n \nAgainst this, Brown (1999) adopts a more critical starting point for his research focussing on \nconflicts of use, respect for the host culture and specifically what he terms the culturally \ninappropriate tourist behaviour of climbing Ayers Rock \/ Uluru. His study explores visitors' \nbeliefs as a starting point to inform efforts aimed to discourage visitors from climbing Uluru. \nAdditionally Mercer\u2019s (1995) work examined the relationship between western tourism \n 8 \ndevelopment and native peoples. It focused on the social appropriateness of tourism \ndevelopment from the native Aboriginal viewpoint. This concern to give voice to the people \nof the place demonstrates a strong interpretivist and critical motivation for the research. The \nproject presented case studies of Kakadu National Park and Uluru with a particular emphasis \non control and choice. Control was determined by the degree to which native populations \ncontrol their own destinies when negotiating decisions regarding tourism development on \ntheir land. Choice related to their freedom to choose to negotiate, or simply to refuse to do so. \nMercer concluded that growing Aboriginal militancy arose because what they viewed as their \nbasic rights had come up against the western practice of eminent domain. This is a process \nwhere government gains control of individual (or group) owned land for the good of the \nmany, through a legal process often including condemnation. Mercer comments that this \npractice, together with other denials of land ownership can lead to a reading of the events as \nthe invasion and theft of the Aboriginal nation. This latter part of Mercer\u2019s work clearly treats \nwith constructionism as its different interpretation of the situation calls on a reading and \nproduction of knowledge from a different cultural perspective. It also demonstrates several \naspects of critical theory referred to in table one.  It deploys critical enlightenment in its \nanalysis of the winners and losers in the current managerial arrangements. It also uncovers \nthe hegemonic tendency and discursive power by which the dominant ideology of tourism \nconstructs and forms the tourism landscape.  \n \nThe management challenge posed by this section is one of finding appropriate ends for \nmanagement. Critical theory can subject conventional management plans to ideology critique \nand can offer a way of generating a more meaningful stakeholder analysis and one where \nother the aspirations of \u201cother\u201d stakeholders are not subjected to an ideological framing and \ninterpretation by the most powerful. For example utilizing critical theory\u2019s (and a \nFoucauldian) understanding of discursive power, Whittaker\u2019s (1999) study illustrated how \ntourism knowledge about aboriginal Australians is often generated from an ethnocentric \n(Western, developed, colonial) position. The challenge suggested here is to reclaim and \nreposition knowledge of indigenous people in order to deliver better management of tourism \nthat impinges upon them.  \n \nGovernance \nMowforth and Munt (2003:252) describe governance as: \n\u2026 the web of institutions and agencies that are central players \nin the political environment [including] \u2026 national \ngovernments, bilateral development agencies and the \nsupranational institutions (such as the World Bank, IMF and \nUnited Nations). \nBut if these are its institutions what does governance mean for tourism? It refers to the \ncomplex set of agencies that are involved in the planning, regulation and control of tourism \nitself and the political environment in which it operates. \n \nTurning first to the political environment, tourism above all requires a stable international \nenvironment in which to develop. But here tourism is in a period of crisis. Witness this \nstatement from the Chief Executive of British Airways (British Airways 2005:4): \u201cIt has \nbecome the norm for me to report on the impact of one crisis after another in my statement to \nshareholders.\u201d Yet tourism cannot easily admit to its crisis. This is because tourism depends \nupon a strong ideology for its success. Tourism is about freedom for travel and enjoyment. \nMuch of the rhetoric of tourism is still that of dreams. Yet those dreams are increasingly \npunctuated by nightmares. As a form of escape, tourism eschews the political. Yet tourism is \n 9 \ndeeply implicated in politics. If it is, as the World Tourism Organisation often reminds us, the \nworld\u2019s biggest industry it clearly contributes significantly to the ordering (Franklin 2004) of \nthe world. That ordering includes its contribution to as well as its feedback from global \nterrorism. Here, the key crisis facing tourism is that of global security which quite simply and \nstarkly can no longer be guaranteed. There have been increasing attacks both directly and \nindirectly impacting on tourism. These include attacks on airports and the hijackings of \nplanes from the 1970s, the Lockerbie bombing (1983), the 9\/11 attacks in the USA (2001), \nthe 7\/7 bombings in London (2005), the Bali bombings (2002 and 2005) and the Sharm el \nSheik bombing (2005).  \n \nBut the response to such events mainly operates in the technical domain. For example British \nAirways offers an insight into a typical response from the business community: \n \nSecurity has always been paramount, more so since the tragic \nevents of 9\/11. Since then, new security and immigration \nregulations have been introduced, which range from fitting new \ncockpit doors to providing authorities with passport \ninformation in advance of arrival (British Airways 2005:4). \n \nThe response of the research community has also mainly been driven by technical concerns. \nExamples from the recent literature include Blake and Sinclair (2003) who suggest subsidies \nand tax reductions as a means of addressing the situation arising from 9\/11: Henderson \n(2003) who examines the responses of official tourism and marketing agencies to the 2002 \nBali bombing and Pizam and Fleischer (2002) who analyse the severity versus frequency of \nacts of terrorism to determine which has a larger impact on tourism demand. Similarly \nMassey (2005) examined the public relations efforts of the US airlines to restore consumer \nconfidence in the industry in the wake 9\/11. What is noticeable about all of the above \nexamples is the lack of attention to understanding critical issues at the heart of global \nterrorism. Of course security measures are important but tightening up security in one area \noften results in displacement of terrorist activity to a new weaker area and there are an almost \ninfinite number of weak spots in the tourist system. (Witness the move of attacks form air \ntransport to rail transport exemplified by the Madrid and London bombings). It leads to \nproblem shifting not problem resolution.  \n \nThere is surely an urgent case for more research of an interpretive and critical nature to \nsupplement that of a technical nature. But the nature of the crisis makes this doubly difficult \nbecause the political reaction to the crisis has been to re-invigorate existing ideological \npositions and create sharp binary divisions. Just as tourist academics have concentrated on the \nus\/other (exotic), the post-crisis binaries have become more deeply divisive between for \nexample: us \/ other (terrorist): peace and freedom loving peoples \/ the enemy:  those with us \/ \nthose against us. The last of these makes critical enquiry, which deeply questions issues of \npower and truth, especially difficult because critical enquirers can easily be cast into the \n\u201cagainst us\u201d category and therefore become marginalised and isolated.  \n \nTwo examples demonstrate limited forays of interpretive and critical research into terrorism \nand tourism. First Robinson and Meaton (2005:69) investigated disparate discourses \nsurrounding the Bali bombing where they found other discourses competing with official \ndiscourses for the \u201cvoice of Bali\u201d: \n \n 10 \nFollowing 12 October there was a politically powerful and \nurgent call for Bali to get back to \u2018business as usual\u2019. This \nopinion was presented rationally, coherently and with authority. \nIt is, it implies, the voice of Bali. However, for many in Bali \nthe events of 12 October presented a critical time for reflection \nand seeds were evident of fledgling calls for change. \n \nRobinson and Meaton therefore seek a more critical understanding of the reaction of the \npeople of Bali to the bombings beyond the technical issues of security and reconstruction. \nTheir argument contends that a failure to capture and take account of the concerns of critical \nlocal voices will threaten the recovery and sustainability of tourism in Bali since issues of \nconflict, alienation and marginalization would remain suppressed and liable to resurface. In a \nsimilar way the resolution of conflict in Northern Ireland was unlocked by interpretive and \ncritical approaches that sought understanding and liberation where technical solutions based \non increased security had repeatedly failed. Concomitantly tourism in Northern Ireland has \nshown remarkable recovery. \n \nSecond, Higgins-Desbiolles (2005) offers a critical polemic focussing on terrorism and \ntourism. Here she replaces MacCannell\u2019s (1992) concept of \u201cEmpty Meeting Grounds\u201d with \na more chilling one of \u201cHostile Meeting Grounds\u201d. The emancipatory spirit of the article is \nsignalled in its preface: \nNo one seems to ask why there is terrorism, and if a war against \nterrorism will solve any problems at all. Justice and justice \nalone will bring peace  \u2026 as long as the world is assymetrical, \nthere will be no peace (5) \n \nLeaning heavily on Fanon\u2019s (1967) banner of The Wretched of the Earth Higgins-Desbiolles \nprovides an alternative system of analytical binaries which include: wretched\/rich: world as \nplayground\/world as home and workplace. These binaries serve to demonstrate basic \nasymmetries in the tourism system leading Higgins-Desbiolles to conclude that: \nTourism must serve the \u201cwretched\u201d as well as the \u201crich\u201d if it is \nto continue to enjoy the open access it has been given to the \nworld\u2019s resources and the faith that has been instilled in it for \nimproving the lives of people (p. 29). \nHer article points up an alternative battleground for the war on terror underlining the \nimportance of peace for the prosperity of tourism and the connection between peace and \njustice. Both these articles represent progress in the theoretical side of critical tourism studies \nsince they attempt \u201cto uncover the winners and losers in particular social arrangements and \nthe processes by which such power plays operate\u201d (Kincheloe and McLaren 2003:437).  \n \nA further goal of critical theory is that of critical emancipation where the end is \u201cgreater \ndegrees of autonomy and human agency\u201d (Kincheloe and McLaren 2003:437). This signals a \nmove from theory to practice and the following examples demonstrate how the findings of \ncritique can be translated into practical actions.  The first example is Tourism Concern. The \nmission of Tourism Concern is to effect change in the tourism industry by \ncampaigning for fair and ethically traded tourism. Its activities include campaigning \nabout the displacement of the Maasai from their homes in East Africa, the conditions \nendured by some porters who accompany trekkers in mountain environments and \nfair pay. Tourism Concern has also provided a voice for the less powerful developed \ncountries concerned about the imposition of the GATS free trade treaty that \n 11 \nrepresents the interests of the powerful developed nations neglecting issues of fair \ntrade. \n \nThe second example is Pro-Poor Tourism. Here Ashley, Boyd, and Goodwin (2000:1) \nnote that: \nIn the tourism sector, national governments and donors have \ngenerally aimed to promote private sector investment, macro-\neconomic growth and foreign exchange earnings, without \nspecifically taking the needs and opportunities of the poor into \naccount in tourism development. \nThey make the additional point that  \nDonor-supported tourism master plans focus on creating \ninfrastructure, stimulating private investment and attracting \ninternational tourists. Investors are often international \ncompanies and local elites, whose profits are generally \nrepatriated abroad or to metropolitan centres. Links with the \nlocal economy are often weak, with the possible exception of \nemployment. \n \nHence the development of the concept of Pro-Poor Tourism represents a move in critical \nenlightenment and its programme of action illustrates critical emancipation as it seeks to \nincrease the net benefits derived from tourism for poor people. It aims to enhance the \nlinkages between poor people and businesses to increase tourism's contribution to the \nreduction of poverty and involve poor people in the development of tourism. Typically  \u2018the \npoor\u2019 include staff, producers of food, fuel and other suppliers, operators of micro tourism \nbusinesses,  craft-makers, hawkers and those who could benefit from tourism as well as those \nwhose resources are directly affected by tourism development. Pro poor tourism strategies \nrange from increasing local employment to the provision of consultation. \n \nTo summarise this section, critical research can play an important part in extending, \nsupplementing and challenging the dominant discourses that pervade the management and \ngovernance of tourism. It can question taken for granted recipes and responses and lead to a \ndeeper engagement with aims and ends. It can illuminate tourism\u2019s blind spots. In the light of \nthis the next section will examine the extent to which tourism research exhibits critical \napproaches. \n \nThe Extent of Critical Tourism \nThe findings here are based on data from the CAB International abstracts database CABABS. \nThis is used to provide tentative indications of the overall dimensions of tourism research and \nrelative size of critical tourism research. The CABI (www.leisuretourism.com) database \n(CABABS) contains abstracts from around 400 publications in leisure, sport, tourism and \nhospitality research from 1974 to the present.  The data collection method was as follows. \nFirst a filter was applied to the database using the search code UU700 to narrow the search to \njust tourism entries. CABABS was then searched to provide data from tourism entries using a \nvariety of different terms that might indicate use of the concept of critical tourism as \ndiscussed earlier. These are based on potential proxy terms that might indicate the presence \nof critical theory. The third column in table one illustrates the list of these terms.  The list was \ncompiled from keywords or authors\u2019 names relating to aspects of critical theory that were \nevident in columns one and two of table one or in the description given in the text.   \n \n 12 \nHowever terms such as \u201cequity\u201d include meanings unrelated to critical theory (e.g. shares) \nand over-reporting may therefore take place. In order to minimise this problem a test of \nambiguity was applied to the list of potential proxy terms. The list was divided into those \nwhich appeared to be ambiguous and those which appeared to be unambiguous. This division \nwas adjusted after a deeper inspection of the titles and abstracts of the terms. In each case a \nrandom page of 25 search results (in some cases fewer because of a low total) was examined \nin detail to ascertain whether the proxy term was being used in a critical theory context or \nnot. For example the term \u201cvalues\u201d was found to have high ambiguity due to its use in the \ncontext of economic and ecological valuation. Similarly the string \u201cautonom*\u201d was \nfrequently found to refer to \u201cautonomous regions\u201d and most notable was that \u201cagency\u201d \nmainly referred to travel agency. A margin of error of 12 per cent was applied and terms \nwhich failed this test (i.e. were used in a different context in more than 12 per cent of cases) \nwere excluded. The final list of least ambiguous terms was designated robust proxy terms and \nthis appears in table two. \n \nTwo periods were examined: 1974 to 2000 and 1974 \u2013 2005 (where no period is mentioned \nthe survey covers the period 1974 \u2013 2005). 1974 is the date when the abstracts were first fully \ncompiled and the two periods were chosen to identify both the total picture and to see \nwhether there had been any noticeable increase over a recent period. In many cases an \nasterisk was used in the search string to stand for a wild character to enable the derivative \nforms of terms to be included \u2013 for example hegemon* would stand for hegemony and \nhegemonic. However the simple robust proxy term (e.g. hegemony) is used in the analysis \nthat follows.  \n \nThe results of the searches are found in table two but there are some limitations to the method \nwhich should be noted.  First, only titles, keywords and abstracts are interrogated and \ntherefore articles where their orientation is only apparent in the main body of their text are \nnot found. However it is likely that research which is determinedly critical would include at \nleast one of these keywords in the fields that were searched.  Second the use of UU700 coded \nCABABS abstracts may miss literature that is classified elsewhere (e.g. under sociology or \nmanagement. The main results of now follow. \n \nTable 2:  Frequency of robust proxy critical terms in CABABS titles and abstracts \nTerm 1974- 2000 1974 - 2005 \nAdorno 0 0 \nCritical Theor* 5 10 \nDiscourse 41 118 \nEmancipat* 10 16 \nEquality 23 36 \nExclusion 30 60 \nFeminis* 41 53 \nFoucaul* 3 17 \nGaze 23 58 \nGramsc* 1 1 \nHabermas* 0 2 \nHegemon* 9 16 \nHorkheimer 0 0 \nIdeolog* 152 190 \nInequality 37 48 \nMarx* 16 22 \nOppress* 8 12 \nTotal of above terms (1) 399 659 \nTotal tourism articles 28079 35194 \nNote: (1) These totals may include double counting of some articles \n \n 13 \nThe first point to note is the large number of articles in the CACBABS database that fall into \nthe UU700 category of tourism \u2013 a total of 35194 between 1974 and 2005. But the interesting \nquestion for this enquiry is the extent to which critical theory is deployed in this large sample. \nThe first line of enquiry was to interrogate the CABABS database to discover the incidence \nof the term critical theory itself. An example found is Jamal and Everrett (2004) who use \nYellowstone National Park to show how a critical narrative interprets natural spaces as \ncultural, political and economic texts mediated by a number of scientific, promotional and \nsymbolic tools serving a diverse range of interests. But such articles are rare and it turns out \nthat this term only occurs in the summary details of ten of the 35194 articles abstracted. This \nindicates a very low incidence of critical theory and this finding triangulates well with \nBotterill et al\u2019s (2003:293) survey of doctoral theses which found \u201cfew abstracts that \nindicated the influences of critical theory\u201d. But what of the other robust proxy terms that can \nindicate research that is operating within the critical theory domain? The main contributors to \nthe critical theory school were Gramsci, Adorno, Habermas and Horkheimer and it is \ninteresting to note that these names appear in only three abstracts in the CABABS database. \n \nThe terms ideology and hegemony and discourse are related terms that are central to critical \ntheory in that they demonstrate how power and partiality can be transmitted in tourism. Each \nhas also survived as a robust proxy term. The term ideology appears in 190 abstracts and as \nsuch represents the most widely found critical theory term in this survey but still a very small \nproportion of total tourism outputs and this triangulates again with Botterill et al\u2019s survey of \ndoctoral theses where the authors suggest that little tourism research foregrounds ideology.  \nOne of the examples found here is the work of  Hillali (2004) who examines ideological \nrivalries surrounding tourism development in Maghreb. In particular Hillali analyses the \nopposition between conservatism and modernism as symbolised by tourism. Hillali shows \nthat tourism appears as a promoter of Western countries' values based on personal freedom \nbut that such values are heavily contested in some parts of the world especially in Islamic \ncountries. \n \nThere are 118 instances of the term discourse including Chambers\u2019 (2004) study which \nanalyses the power\/knowledge relationships at work in the representation of heritage in and \nthrough tourism. The term hegemony is found in 16 cases. For example Saarinen (2004) \noffers a critical reading of tourist destinations as dynamic, historical units with specific \nidentities characterized by hegemonic and other discourses which all produce a notion of \nwhat the destination is and represents at the time. Discourse is closely related to the \nFoucauldian approach to research but it appears that few tourism researchers turn to Foucault \nfor their theoretical insights \u2013 only 17 of the CABABS articles returned his name in their \nsummaries. Included here are Cheong and Miller (2000) who provide a Foucauldian \nobservation on power and tourism demonstrating that power is omnipresent in tourism \nrelationships and that the touristic gaze is considered a primary mechanism by which travel \nagents, guides, and some locals operate in the power relationship vis-a-vis tourists. Indeed the \nconcept of the gaze is found in 58 cases in this survey, including of course the seminal work \nof Urry (2002). \n \nThe conditions of inequality, exclusion and oppression often stimulate an interest from \ncritical theorists whilst the ends which are typically sought by critical theory are those of \nemancipation and equality. In the former set, 48 returns are found for inequality, 60 for \nexclusion and 12 for oppression. For example Mordue\u2019s (2005) ethnographic research on the \nwalled historic city centre of York (UK) examines issues of power and control regarding the \nactivities the \"historic core\" is meant for. He concludes that this is a contested space which \n 14 \ncertain social groups are encouraged to consume while others are subject to accusations of \nperformative incompetence and tactics of social exclusion. In the latter set there are 16 \ninstances of the term emancipation and 36 of equality. Deutschlander and Miller (2004) write \non the issue of tourism as a project that may support marginalized groups in their political \nstruggle for equality in mainstream society. Using a discourse analytic approach they \nexamine counterhegemonic claims regarding the buffalo-hunting Plains Indian Culture \nComplex of the First Nations of Treaty-7 in southern Alberta, Canada. In particular, they \nchallenge the dominant view regarding the technological inferiority of indigenous cultures, \nwhich has been perpetuated in the colonial binary of Western\/non-Western societies. \n \nFinally standpoint research - where research is carried out from a declared ideological \nposition -  is a specific form of critical research. The two examples of feminist and Marxist \nresearch are examined here. Interrogation of the CABABS database finds the term feminist \nonly in the summaries of 53 of its entries suggesting that few tourism researchers have \nadopted an overtly feminist methodology. This finding is readily triangulated. In the Meyer-\nArendt and Justice (2002) review of dissertation studies only one out of the 377 dissertations \nexamined were classified under women\u2019s studies. Similarly only ten of a total of 57 \ncontributors listed in Lew, Hall and Williams\u2019s (2004) A Companion to Tourism are women.  \nHall, Swain and Kinnaird (2003:11) note \u201crelatively little engagement to date between \nfeminist studies and tourism studies in the development of gender thinking in tourism\u201d. \nHowever there is some evidence of a mounting of a Foucauldian form of resistance including \nthe 1995 special issue of Annals of Tourism Research Gender in Tourism edited by Margaret \nSwain and the 2003 special issue of Tourism Recreation Research Gender Tourism. Hall, \nSwain and Kinnaird who edited the latter reports that \u201ca transnational network of researchers \nfocusing on gender dimensions of Tourism Studies has developed over the past decade\u201d \n(2003:7). Finally the term Marx is found in 22 of the CABABS entries. \n \nIn summary the data provided in table two points to a very limited engagement of tourism \nresearch with critical theory. By 2005 the proxy terms were apparent in only 659 research \ntexts out of 35194 texts in total (1.87%) and even this small number includes instances of \ndouble counting where one text might contain multiple proxy terms. This data therefore \nconfirms the findings of Riley and Love (2000:180) whose study concluded that: \n Based on the number of quantitative versus qualitative articles \nin the four tourism journals, there is little doubt that the \n\u201cdominant\u201d paradigm is positivism. \n \nThe data also demonstrates that within the critical paradigm the greatest interest has been \nshown in the areas of ideology, discourse and exclusion. Aditionally the data does point to an \nincreasing overall interest. Whilst the total research texts recorded in CABAS has risen by \n20.2% between 2000 and 2005, the incidence of the proxy terms has increased by 39.4% - \nalmost double the rate. \n \nConclusion \nReturning to the aims of this paper a significant research gap has been found between the lack \nof critical research and the many significant issues requiring its insights and guidance. In \nterms of its objectives this paper first identified the various meanings of critical as applied to \ntourism. Taking a lead from the Frankfurt School it identified what it is to be critical in the \nsense of critical theory. It next examined the potential use of critical theory in the \nmanagement and governance of tourism and through its examples established a strong case \nfor the business of tourism to embrace a more critical agenda. At the same time it was found \n 15 \nthat criticality is threatened and marginalised by the very forces (terrorism and its response in \ndeepening ideological retrenchments) that make its deployment so very necessary. Third the \nextent of criticality was examined by making some crude quantitative estimations of the size \nof critical research in comparison with total tourism research output. Here it was found that \ncritical tourism is still marginal in terms of the whole effort of tourism research.  \n \nThese findings have important implications for the management and governance of tourism. \nIf we look to the key issues that are likely to affect the tourism industry into the future they \nfall into two categories. On the one hand there are issues such as the changing nature of \ntourists (often referred to as new tourists or post tourists): the rapid pace of change in \ninformation and communication technologies: destination competitiveness: the rise of China \nas a tourism generating and receiving country: new business models and tourism satellite \naccounts. On the other hand there are issues such as sustainability (in environmental terms \nincluding global warming and tourism\u2019s contribution to it via the carbon emissions of air \ntravel but also in terms of the very survival of tourism): terrorism and peace: globalisation \nand community tourism: ethical tourism and social exclusion; equity and poverty elimination. \nThe successful management of the first group of issues will generally call on research of a \ntechnical nature which must typically be undertaken using positivist methods. The second \ngroup of issues also generates some technical research issues (e.g. measurement of air \nemissions and tourism multipliers). But an important distinction between each group of issues \nis their relationship to power. Current configurations of power structures and the operation of \nthe free market will generally assist in the delivery of better management for the first set of \nissues. However progress for the second set of issues can often be inhibited by current \nconfigurations of power and the operation of dominant ideological practices. For example \nRowe (2005) argues that an ideological deployment of culture and tourism can hide the need \nfor more profound structural remedies to social and economic problems. Here critical \nresearch is uniquely placed to contribute to better management and governance of tourism. \nFor ideology and power relations and particularly those that are well-disguised and taken for \ngranted, are a key focus for critical tourism research. If we are to make genuine and deep \nprogress in sustainable tourism in both its environmental and survival senses there is an \nurgent need to understand the operation of ideology and power as a prelude to better \nmanagement and governance. \n \nWhat might this mean in practice and what are the some possible pointers for a more critical \nresearch agenda? At the researcher level more cross-fertilisation and sharing of ideas and \nresearch across the paradigm divides would help. Increasingly conferences, journals and \nresearch groups have become less fluid and more boundary conscious. Researchers need to \ncommunicate across these divides and the publication of this article in The Journal of Travel \nResearch, a journal with a strong positivist tradition, represents such a move. Additionally \ncritical researchers would be encouraged to locate the practical implications of their research. \nTourism firms might address more research to a better understanding of their stakeholders \nwith the aim of ensuring that their business practices benefit a fuller range of stakeholders \nthan the narrow ones of shareholders and customers. Tourism industry lead bodies might seek \nto identify and engage with the broader political questions that impinge on tourism. Perhaps \ngovernments (and NGOs such as the UNWTO) currently see tourism development too much \nin terms of investment incentives, destination planning and the measurement of economic \nimpacts. A critical issue for research and action is a need to understand what can disrupt the \npeace and stability that tourism depends on. Similarly governments need to concentrate on \nevidence-based policy to maximise the benefits of tourism development for all and indeed to \nidentify the values that should govern tourism development.  Meanwhile NGOs such as \n 16 \nTourism Concern should continue to research basic issues of ethical tourism with a view to \nencouraging better tourism practices. \n \nFinally, critical tourism aims for understanding, belonging, being, emancipation and \naccommodation in and with the world. But if tourism does not become a fully critical \nbusiness it will seek only technical solutions to issues of management and governance. In \nterms of the current crisis of terrorism and the latent crisis of asymmetries such technical \n(uncritical) solutions may include the erecting of higher barriers and more intricate security \nbetween its privileged self and the rest of the world which by definition tourism needs to be \npart of. Such a route is sure to lead to tourism\u2019s alienation and catastrophic demise long \nbefore any serious effects of global warming come into play. Hence the importance to rise to \nBarnett\u2019s challenge, to incorporate the critical into business, the business into critical, and to \nrealise the critical business of tourism. This is not an obvious agenda for tourism businesses \nbut it has become ever more critical one. \n \n REFERENCES \n \nApple, M. (1990). Ideology and the Curriculum.
