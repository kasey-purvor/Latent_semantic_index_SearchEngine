Patients were\nrecruited from a neurology clinic, attended a day hospital from home weekly for six weeks using pri-\nvate car or hospital transport, and received group educational activities and individual rehabilitation\nfrom a multidisciplinary team.

Follow up treatments may be needed to main-\ntain any benefit.\nParkinson\u2019s disease is a common cause of disability,especially in the elderly.1 2 Drug treatment is remarkablyeffective in the early stages but in most patients the\ndisease progresses so that they become increasingly disabled\ndespite optimal drug therapy.3 Furthermore there is some\nreluctance to use drugs, both in the early stages and at doses\nthat fully reverse the impairments, because it is possible that\ndrugs themselves affect the progress or manifestations of the\ndisease.3 Surgical treatments are also available4 but carry risks\nand anyway could not be used on the majority of patients.\nConsequently there is a role for non-pharmacological\ninterventions,5\u20138 which should proceed in parallel with drug\ntreatment, especially as it has been found that the main\nfactors influencing quality of life are depression, disability,\npostural instability, and cognitive decline.9\nThere have been several systematic reviews investigating\naspects of rehabilitation in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease,\nbut with one exception10 they conclude that there is no useful\nevidence to support or refute any specific or general rehabili-\ntation intervention.11\u201313 However, recent research does suggest\nthat multi-professional expert teams may offer effective and\nefficient rehabilitation to patients with complex neurological\ndisability, whether acute14 or progressive.15 There is some\nevidence that a specialist day hospital setting is an effective\nway of delivering rehabilitation.16 17 Group occupational\ntherapy has been found to be effective for Parkinson\u2019s disease\nin one trial.18\nWe therefore set up a study to investigate the effectiveness\nof a six week course of rehabilitation involving both individu-\nalised treatments offered by a multidisciplinary team and\ngroup educational support. The programme was delivered in a\nday hospital setting to patients living in the community.\nAnalysis of data collected immediately after intervention was\ncompleted has suggested some immediate benefit,19 but the\nprimary goal of this study was always to investigate the effects\nfour months after the end of intervention.\nMETHODS\nWe used a randomised, single blind controlled crossover\ndesign comparing six weeks of active intervention with no\nactive intervention, assessing the outcome at six months after\nentry. The actual design and flow of patients were influenced\nby two factors: all patients had to be offered treatment, both\nbecause the funding was primarily intended to deliver a serv-\nice and because team members wanted this; and access to\nfacilities was limited, such that only one group of six patients\ncould be treated at any one time. Therefore the control group\nreceived the intervention six months after entry, immediately\nafter their second assessment, and both groups were\nreassessed at one year.\nPatients were recruited in cohorts of 12, randomised into\ntwo groups of six with one receiving early and one delayed\nintervention. As shown in fig 1, one cycle included 48 patients\nand lasted 48 weeks. We aimed to recruit 144 patients in 12\ncohorts, giving 24 separate treatment groups over three cycles\nin three years.\nThe main analysis was a comparison of outcomes at 24\nweeks, when one group of patients had received the\nintervention\u2014finishing about four months before\u2014and the\nother group was about to start treatment. To control for any\nimbalance at entry, a repeated measures analysis of variance\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAbbreviations: HAD, hospital anxiety and depression scale; NHPT,\nnine hole peg test; PDQ, Parkinson\u2019s disease questionnaire; SF-36, short\nform 36 item health survey; UPDRS, unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating\nscale\nSee Editorial Commentary\np 148\nSee end of article for\nauthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nProfessor Derick T Wade,\nOxford Centre for\nEnablement, Windmill\nRoad, Oxford OX3 7LD,\nUK;\nderick.wade@dial.pipex.com\nReceived 29 May 2002\nIn revised form 30 August\n2002\nAccepted 12 September\n2002\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n158\nwww.jnnp.com\n on 12 June 2008 jnnp.bmj.comDownloaded from \nwas undertaken20 using the SPSS general linear model\nprocedure.21 The effect of the intervention was tested by the\nstatistical interaction between treatment group and time. A\nsignificant interaction would indicate that patients who had\nreceived the intervention had fared differently from those who\nhad not. A second analysis using a similar procedure\ncompared data from all patients before rehabilitation and four\nmonths after.\nTo be included, the following criteria had to be fulfilled: the\npatients had to have Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosed clinically\nby a consultant neurologist (PT) with a special interest in the\ndisease; they had to give their consent; there should be no\nmajor cognitive losses (defined as scoring 7\/10 or more on the\nabbreviated mental test22); and they had to be able to attend\nthe day hospital using either their own or hospital transport.\nAfter agreeing to participate they were accumulated into\ncohorts of 12 patients and then randomised using a computer\ngenerated block randomisation procedure giving two groups\nof six. This was undertaken at an independent institution, and\nthe rehabilitation programme organiser was told the group for\neach registered patient.\nThe assessments used were a Parkinson\u2019s disease disability\nquestionnaire23; the Parkinson\u2019s disease questionnaire (PDQ-\n3924); the short form 36 item health survey (SF-36)25; the\nEuroqol-5d (an index of health related quality of life)26; the\nstand-walk-sit test,27 reported as seconds to complete test; the\nnine hole peg test (NHPT) of manual dexterity, reported as\nseconds to place all nine pegs28; the hospital anxiety and\ndepression scale (HADs29); and selected items concerning\nspeech from the unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale\n(UPDRS).30. Carers were assessed using the carer strain\nindex31 and the Euroqol-5d.\nThe assessments were undertaken in the day hospital by an\nindependent assessor who was not involved in the treatment\nprogramme and who was not informed of the patient\u2019s group.\nThe same assessments were used at time zero (after random-\nisation before any treatment), at 24 weeks (after one group\nhad received treatment but before the other group started\ntreatment), and at 48 weeks.\nThe intervention comprised a multidisciplinary rehabilita-\ntion programme. The patient attended for whole days, coming\nin once a week for six consecutive weeks. In the first week the\npatient was assessed and an individualised programme of one\nto one treatment was planned, to run over the next five weeks\nfrom a specialist team including a Parkinson\u2019s disease special-\nist nurse, a physiotherapist, a speech and language therapist,\nand an occupational therapist. Each week the patient then\nreceived two hours of individual treatment in the morning,\nfollowed by group activities (for example, talks from experts\nand relaxation) in the afternoon. All patients were assessed by\na social services care manager. The content of the programme\nis available from the authors. After their last attendance each\npatient was reassessed using a small battery of measures\nreported elsewhere.19\nRESULTS\nIn all, 137 separate patients were included, but there were 144\nregistrations because seven patients in the delayed treatment\ngroup withdrew before treatment but then requested re-entry;\nthese were re-entered (and re-randomised) with a new\nnumber. Of the 144 registrations, 124 (86%) were from a spe-\ncialist Parkinson\u2019s disease neurology clinic, nine from self\nreferral, four from geriatric clinics, and seven were re-\nregistrations. The flow the 144 registered patients is shown in\nfig 2. The patients who withdrew and re-entered have only\nbeen included once in any analysis.\nDifficulties with transport and intercurrent illness led to\nsome patients missing one or more assessments or withdraw-\ning from the study. Consequently only 71 patients had all\nthree assessments, 94 had both a first and a second\nassessment, and 86 had assessments both before and after\ntheir allocated treatment spell.\nFigure 1 Design of study; cycle 1 of three; flow of first 48 patients\nover 48 weeks\nFigure 2 Patient flow through the study.\nMultidisciplinary rehabilitation in Parkinson\u2019s disease 159\nwww.jnnp.com\n on 12 June 2008 jnnp.bmj.comDownloaded from \nThe baseline characteristics of the 94 patients and 68 carers\nentered into the analysis are shown in table 1. The two groups\nwere similar on all variables, with no statistically significant\ndifferences. The results on the samemeasures at the six month\ncrossover point are also shown in table 1. At this point the sec-\nond group was about to start treatment. There was only one\nsignificant difference between the two groups\u2014those patients\nin the treated group who were able to walk on both occasions\nwere faster on the stand-walk-sit test (p = 0.044).\nThe results of general linear modelling analysis,20 21 allowing\nfor the initial patient state and the patient cohort, are shown\nin column 5 of table 1. Significant differences were recorded\nfor SF-36 mental component summary scores and in the\nSF-36 general health and mental health subscales: the treated\ngroup had deteriorated while the control group had improved\nat the crossover point. Similarly, the carers of treated patients\nshowed more strain, while the carers of patients about to start\nrehabilitation showed less strain. Finally, patients in the\ntreated group showed a slight increase in speed in the stand-\nwalk-sit test, while the control group showed some deteriora-\ntion.\nA related measures t test was used to compare the data from\nbefore treatment with the data from six months after the\ntreatment started in the 86 patients who had full pre- and\npostintervention data (table 2). This showed that, despite\ntreatment, patients deteriorated significantly on some meas-\nures and showed no improvement, which is consistent with\nthe fact that Parkinson\u2019s disease is a progressive disorder. A\nstatistically significant deterioration was recorded in four\nmeasures: the Parkinson\u2019s disease disability questionnaire,23\nthe SF-36 physical component summary, the SF-36 general\nhealth subscale, and the Euroqol scale value. The carers also\nshowed more strain on the carer strain index.\nComparison of the 94 patients included in the primary\nanalysis with the remaining 43 patients (data not shown)\nshowed that the patients who did not complete the rehabilita-\ntion programme and research protocol were more disabled\nand older at baseline.\nDISCUSSION\nThe main findings were a consistent worsening in all patient\nmeasures, reaching statistical significance in their emotional\nstate and in carer stress over six months. This decline was\nlargely unaffected by rehabilitation, although there may have\nbeen a minor, equivocal benefit on the mobility of walking\npatients. This is in contrast to the data from the same patients\nrecorded immediately after intervention, which did show\nbeneficial effects.19 The study suffered from considerable loss\nof patients but nonetheless it is one of the largest randomised\nstudies of non-pharmacological treatments for patients with\nParkinson\u2019s disease, and it shows that such trials are feasible.\nOnemajor weakness in the study is the loss of data from the\noldest and most disabled patients. However, the assessor was\nindependent of the treatment team, and was not aware of a\npatient\u2019s group when assessing a patient. It seems unlikely\nthat the loss of data has biased the results, and we believe that\nTable 1 Comparison of early and late groups with full data from first and second assessments (n = 94)\nBaseline 24 weeks\nSignificance*Early Late Early Late\nPatients\nn 53 41 53 41\nMale:female (n) 30:23 26:15\nAge (years) 71.3 (8.6) 70.4 (7.6)\nPD disability questionnaire: 25 (good) to\n125\n48.9 (14.4) 50.3 (18.0) 53.4 (17.4) 55.3 (19.5) 0.558\nPDQ-39: 0 (good) to 100 26.1 (11.3) 27.6 (12.2) 26.7 (13.7) 26.2 (13.2) 0.439\nSF-36 physical component summary: 0\n(bad) to 100\n29.8 (10.8) 29.7 (9.7) 28.8 (10.9) 28.1 (11.8) 0.602\nSF-36 mental component summary: 0 (bad)\nto 100\n50.6 (8.8) 48.0 (10.4) 49.8 (10.7) 51.2 (9.0) 0.037a\nSF-36 mental health subscale: 0 (bad) to\n100\n71.1 (15.2) 67.6 (19.2) 67.9 (18.3) 72.5 (13.5) 0.019b\nSF-36 general health subscale: 0 (bad) to\n100\n50.4 (21.5) 43.8 (17.4) 42.7 (18.7) 48.0 (17.6) 0.002c\nStand-walk-sit time (s) 20.1 (8.7), n=49 21.5 (8.0), n=39 19.4 (6.9), n=49 23.2 (10.3)d, n=39 0.093\nNine hole peg test (s) 23.9 (31.2), n=51 20.2 (7.4), n=41 20.4 (14.8),\nn=52\n20.0 (8.1), n=40 0.273\nEuroqol scale: \u22120.59 (bad) to 1.00 0.73 (0.20) 0.74 (0.18) 0.66 (0.22) 0.67 (0.27) 0.951\nEuroqol VAS: 0 (bad) to 100 72.7 (17.4) 71.4 (14.7) 68.2 (18.6) 68.7 (15.9) 0.633\nUPDRS, speech: 0 (good) to 4 1.40 (0.97) 1.68 (0.93) 1.60 (0.97) 1.61 (0.97) 0.129\nUPDRS, salivation: 0 (good) to 4 1.13 (1.11) 1.24 (1.04) 1.21 (1.03) 1.34 (1.17) 0.922\nUPDRS, swallowing: 0 (good) to 4 0.89 (1.05) 0.85 (1.09) 1.15 (1.10) 1.10 (1.07) 0.923\nUPDRS, writing: 0 (good) to 4 2.17 (1.14) 2.27 (1.16) 2.30 (1.15) 2.46 (1.05) 0.747\nHAD, anxiety: 0 (good) to 21 6.1 (3.5) 6.2 (3.4) 6.1 (3.4) 5.8 (3.6) 0.472\nHAD, depression: 0 (good) to 21 5.6 (3.9) 5.0 (3.6) 5.2 (3.3) 4.9 (3.2) 0.625\nCarers (n = 68)\nCarer strain index: 0 (no strain) to 13 3.0 (2.7), n=40 3.6 (3.4), n=28 3.7 (3.0), n=39 3.3 (3.0), n=28 0.086e\nEuroqol scale: \u22120.59 (bad) to 1 0.86 (0.21), n=40 0.83 (0.33), n=27 0.82 (0.20),\nn=39\n0.81 (0.18), n=29 0.592\nEuroqol VAS: 0 (bad) to 100 78.4 (17.1), n=40 79.0 (14.5), n=27 77.8 (19.8),\nn=39\n80.8 (14.5), n=29 0.996\nUnless otherwise stated, values are mean (SD).\n*Statistical significance of difference in change scores after use of general linear model analysis of variance.\naTreated group had deterioration in emotional distress and controls improved at 24 weeks relative to baseline.\nbTreated group had deterioration in mental health and controls improved at 24 weeks relative to baseline.\ncTreated group had deterioration in general health and controls improved at 24 weeks relative to baseline.\ndTreated group significantly faster, p = 0.044 on direct comparison; p = 0.093 relative to baseline.\neCarers of treated group had increased strain and controls less strain at 24 weeks relative to baseline.\nHAD, hospital anxiety and depression scale; PD, Parkinson\u2019s disease; PDQ-39, Parkinson\u2019s disease questionnaire; SF-36, short form 36; VAS, UPDRS,\nunified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale; visual analogue scale.\n160 Wade, Gage, Owen, et al\nwww.jnnp.com\n on 12 June 2008 jnnp.bmj.comDownloaded from \nthe results are secure. Nevertheless, it will have reduced the\npower of the study, and it is possible that some significant\neffects have been missed. Moreover, the crossover design may\nhave led to some bias against treatment. At the crossover point\nthe patients in the treated group were not only 18 weeks away\nfrom treatment, but they were also aware that no more treat-\nment would be available. Given that they had experienced\nbenefit themselves after treatment,19 they may have been feel-\ning depressed. In addition it is possible that attendance and\nthe educational package may have increased their awareness\nof future deterioration, causing some distress. In contrast the\ncontrol group patients were about to start treatment, which\nmay have improved their mood. This might be the explanation\nfor the consistent changes in mood and carer strain found.\nOur study gives useful information on the measurement of\ndisability in trials investigating Parkinson\u2019s disease. The\nassessments used were all practical, and some measures did\ndetect the expected deterioration over 24 weeks, particularly\nthe Parkinson\u2019s disease disability measure,23 which has also\nbeen found to be sensitive to rehabilitation input in another\ntrial of rehabilitation in Parkinson\u2019s disease.32 The stand-walk-\nsit test, the carer strain index, the SF-36, and the Euroqol also\nseemed sensitive to change, whereas the PDQ-39 did not. This\nstudy not only provides data that will allow others to make\nmore accurate power calculations but also suggests that these\nmeasures (or an equivalent timed measure of mobility) might\nbe the best measures to use.\nOne notable finding of this study is the consistent decline in\nalmost all measures over the six month period. This was of\nsimilar size in both the treated and untreated patients, and\nmirrors the gradual decline also found in stroke patients later\nafter stroke.33\nIn contrast to the uniform decline in function, the minor\ndifferences in change of function detected are difficult to\nevaluate and may simply arise through chance. However, the\nintervention may have improved mobility and this is worth\ninvestigating further because a similar small input was found\nto improve mobility late after stroke.33 The effect on the\npatient\u2019s emotional state and perception of health and carer\nstrain is also difficult to evaluate because, as stated above, it is\npossible that at the crossover point the control group patients\nwere feeling better precisely because they were about to start\nthe programme, whereas the patients who had already had\nthe intervention were depressed because no further input was\ngoing to happen.\nWhy was little evidence of benefit found? The fact that the\npatients were largely recruited from a specialist neurological\nclinic might mean that they were already well managed, and\nhad received other professional support, and that there was\nonly a limited scope for further improvement. Second, it might\nbe argued that six days of rehabilitation totalling about 10\nhours of face to face treatment and 10 hours of group therapy\nwas too little to expect to find effects 18 weeks after stopping\nit. Third, the team did not include a clinical psychologist or a\ndoctor, but the specialist nurse did refer patients back to the\nneurologist if necessary. Fourth, the immediate assessment of\npatients after the programme showed significant improve-\nment across a range of measures and high participant\nsatisfaction19 and therefore it is possible that patients need\nrepeated input to sustain early improvement in the face of a\nprogressive deterioration. Fifth, the measures may either have\nfailed to assess domains where major benefits were occurring,\nor may have been insensitive to clinically significant change.\nOur finding of a decline in most measures over six months is\nconsistent with the known progress of the disease and\nsuggests that the measures were adequately sensitive to\nchange even though some measures such as the UPDRS sub-\nscales were weak.Our measures cover all activity domains that\nseem to be relevant. Last, the study may have been too small to\ndetect a benefit.\nConclusions\nSeveral conclusions can be drawn. First, the design and meas-\nures used were practical, and consequently we have shown\nthat it is possible to undertake research into multi-\nprofessional rehabilitation in patients with Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease in a district general hospital. Second, we have given an\nestimate both of the variance in outcome data and of the likely\nTable 2 Comparison of 86 patients before treatment and 24 weeks later\nGroup Before After Significance*\nPatients (n=86)\nMale:female (n) 50:36 50:36\nAge (years) 71.3 (8.6)\nPD disability questionnaire 51.7 (17.6) 54.8 (18.9) 0.031a\nPDQ-39 25.5 (10.7) 26.0 (12.7) 0.687\nSF-36 physical component summary 29.5 (11.1) 27.28 (10.9) 0.046a\nSF-36 mental component summary 51.0 (8.4) 50.5 (10.3) 0.655\nSF-36 mental health subscale 71.5 (13.5) 70.3 (17.2) 0.474\nSF-36 general health subscale 50.3 (21.0) 38.65 (19.5) <0.001a\nEuroqol scale 0.72 (0.22) 0.66 (0.21) 0.026a\nEuroqol VAS 71.9 (16.4) 68.2 (19.4) 0.110\nStand-walk-sit test (s) 22.9 (18.2), n=82 22.2 (13.5), n=83 0.752\nNine hole peg test seconds 22.4 (24.8), n=83 20.7 (13.0), n=83 0.313\nUPRS, speech 1.42 (0.96) 1.51 (0.95) 0.380\nUPRS, salivation 1.27 (1.22) 1.36 (1.10) 0.369\nUPRS, swallowing 0.91 (1.05) 0.97 (1.05) 0.607\nUPRS, writing 2.29 (1.16) 2.38 (1.12) 0.729\nHAD, anxiety 6.0 (3.4) 5.8 (3.21) 0.729\nHAD, depression 5.2 (3.6) 5.0 (3.2) 0.638\nCarers (n=63)\nCarer strain index 3.1 (2.7), n=61 3.8 (3.2), n=62 0.045a\nEuroqol scale 0.82 (0.22) 0.79 (0.24) 0.235\nEuroqol VAS 78.0 (16.6) 77.5 (19.5) 0.873\nUnless otherwise stated, values are mean (SD).\n*p value of paired t test.\naPatients or carers worse at 24 weeks, after treatment, on these measures.\nHAD, hospital anxiety and depression scale; PD, Parkinson\u2019s disease; PDQ-39, Parkinson\u2019s disease\nquestionnaire; SF-36, short form 36; UPDRS, unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale; VAS, visual analogue\nscale.\nMultidisciplinary rehabilitation in Parkinson\u2019s disease 161\nwww.jnnp.com\n on 12 June 2008 jnnp.bmj.comDownloaded from \nloss of patients in such studies. Third, this study neither sup-\nports individual rehabilitation combined with group therapy\nnor does it show it to be ineffective. The particular\ncircumstances\u2014with patients coming from a specialist clinic\nand the lack of follow up rehabilitation\u2014may have made it\ndifficult to show sustained benefit. Fourth, we believe that\nfuture studies should investigate from a clinical and economic\nperspective both the content of rehabilitation, especially the\ninvolvement of clinical psychologists, and also varying\npatterns of delivery (for example, regular follow up and a\nmore local, more prolonged, but less frequent programme of\nrehabilitation). Last, future studies could reduce the range of\nassessments used to a subset of those used in this study.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe study was funded by Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society of UK, RSCH\nNHS Trust, SHB NHS Trust, Guildford Rotary, Guildford Inner Wheel,\nand many individual donors.
