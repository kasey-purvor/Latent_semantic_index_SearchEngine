INTRODUCTION \nIt is now 7 years since the first Web Content Accessibility \nGuidelines (WCAG1.0) were approved by the World Wide \nWeb Consortium (W3C). Since then the Web has grown in \nboth terms of users and their usage. This growth has led many \ngovernments to pass laws ensuring those with the most to gain \nfrom online services (i.e. users with disabilities) are not \ndiscriminated against through poorly thought out and \ninaccessible design.  \nII. WEB ACCESSIBILITY  \nThe Web has become one of the most important methods of \ncommunication in a very short period of time. In 2005 91% of \nSmall to Medium Enterprises and 99% of large enterprises \nwithin the EU had internet connections [10]. Alongside this, \nnearly half (48%) of all EU households had access to the \nInternet. The number and range of online services has also \nincreased considerably; banking, education, grocery shopping, \nand local government administration all now have online \npresences. As more services come online, it is those with \ndisabilities that have the most to gain. Users with disabilities \nthat make accessing physical services difficult should be able \nmake full use of these new services to make their lives a little \neasier. But to do so, they may need to access the web through \nassistive technologies rather than more mainstream browsers \nsuch as Mozilla or Internet Explorer. However, if a web site is \nnot designed to be flexible enough to work well with such \ntechnologies, then the services offered are inaccessible to users \nwith disabilities. Just as a office on the 3\nrd\n floor of a building \n \n \nwith no lift is inaccessible to wheelchair users, so too is a web \nsite that relies solely on graphics for navigation inaccessible to \na users with visual impairments. In this case, the over reliance \non images is an accessibility barrier. Despite the efforts of the \nWorld Web Consortium (W3C) in promoting and creating \nguidelines[1] for Web Accessibility and various governments \npassing legislation (UK SENDA[5] and in the USA Section \n508[4]) requiring Web Accessibility, a large percentage of \nweb sites remain inaccessible[3]. Lazar believes the problem is \nthat web maintainers do not value Web Accessibility as \nimportant[7], and attributes this partly to a lack of education \nnoting that \u201cAccessibility \u2026 is not a standard part of any \nnational curriculum in Computer Science\u2026or Information \nTechnology\u201d[7]. The authors have since become aware of \nefforts to develop a postgraduate course covering this topic.[9] \n \nThis paper reports the findings from two studies. The first is \na qualitative analysis of individuals with Web Accessibility \nexpertise who worked with organisations to improve \naccessibility (i.e. Web Accessibility specialists). Following \nthis a quantitative survey of web maintainers from over 80 \norganisations that probes current accessibility practices. The \nstudy definitions and details of planning now follow. \nIII. STUDY DEFINITIONS AND PLANNING \nThe research questions to be addressed are as follows; \nA. What is the general perception of Web Accessibility \namongst web maintainers? \nB. When compared to the level of accessibility \nperceived by specialists, is the level of web \naccessibility perceived by web maintainers sufficient? \nC. Do we need a more mature approach towards Web \nAccessibility? \n \nAs mentioned, two studies were carried out. Study One \n(Specialist experiences) surveyed the opinions and \nexperiences of accessibility \u201cspecialists\u201d. These specialists are \neither accessibility consultants who advise organisations on \naccessibility issues, or individuals whose main responsibility \nwithin their organisation is ensuring good accessibility. The \nresults from this study were used to design a second qualitative \nstudy - Study Two (Organisational web practices) which \ninvestigated if and how web accessibility is implemented by \norganisations. Web maintainer refers to those whose main \nWhat is the current state of Web Accessibility? \nJohn Bailey, Elizabeth Burd \nDepartment of Computer Science \nUniversity Of Durham \nDurham DH1 3LE \n{j.o.bailey, liz.burd}@durham.ac.uk \nEighth IEEE International Symposium on Web Site Evolution (WSE'06)\n0-7695-2696-9\/06 $20.00  \u00a9 2006\n 2 \nresponsibility is the management and updating of the \norganisation\u2019s web site. \nA. Study One: Specialist experiences \nA short questionnaire was published online. Topics covered \nwere as follows; \n\u2022 Accessibility guidelines and tools used to evaluate \npages. \n\u2022 Levels of organisational accessibility awareness. \n\u2022 The motivation for organisations to employ an \naccessibility specialist. \n\u2022 Web maintainer perceptions of accessibility. \n \nThe last topic was addressed through a free-text answer and \nhence provided a qualitative response. Such a qualitative \napproach was useful to explore potential perceptions amongst \nweb maintainers. Of course this only revealed what the \naccessibility specialists believed. To build on this, the free-text \nresponses were analysed and as the foundation for the \nquestionnaire used in Study Two. Because Study One targeted \na specific group of individuals (i.e. Web Accessibility \nspecialists), achieving a large enough response was difficult. \nTwo approaches were taken; firstly around 60 accessibility \nconsultants were contacted via a personal email. This was \nconsidered to have a better chance of success than a mass \nemail approach. Following this invitations to participate were \nposted on several Web Accessibility forums. In total 21 valid \nresponses were collected. One pleasing aspect of the Study \nOne was how many different countries participated. Table 1 \nshows that respondents came from 8 (mostly English speaking) \ncountries.  \n \nCountry Respondents \nUSA 6 \nUK 5 \nCanada 4 \nAustralia 2 \nNew Zealand 1 \nIreland 1 \nGermany 1 \nDenmark 1 \nTable 1 Country of Residence of Specialists \nB. Study Two: Organisational web practices \nOnce the responses from the Study One were analysed the \nquestionnaire for Study Two was designed. The purpose of \nthis questionnaire was to survey web maintenance practices \nwithin organisations. Since Study One had already explored \nthe issues surrounding web practices and organisational traits, \nthe questionnaire was designed to be quantitative. It focused, \nin part, on the following; \n\u2022 Whether specific traits \/ practices identified in Study \nOne and also recommended by the W3C[2] were in \nplace at that organisation. \n\u2022 Level of organisational accessibility awareness. \n\u2022 Accessibility guidelines and tools used to evaluate \nweb pages. \n\u2022 Whether accessibility training is offered, and if so to \nwhom. \n \nThe questionnaire was again published online and because \nof the larger potential audience (i.e. any one who carried out \nsome form of web maintenance) a mass email approach was \nused to solicit responses. To encourage participation, the offer \nof an accessibility evaluation for that organisation\u2019s website \nwas made. In total over five hundred emails were sent, mostly \nto UK local government organisations. Originally, companies \nbelonging to the UK FTSE-100 index were targeted. \nUnfortunately, this yielded very few responses. It was felt \nthough, that because of recent criticism aimed public sector \norganisation\u2019s web sites they would be more willing to \nparticipate. In 2005, a government report[3] strongly criticised \nlocal governmental web sites\u2019 accessibility and hence \naccessibility has had a higher profile in the UK local \ngovernment sector. Thus in total, 86 organisations expressed a \nwillingness to participate and of these 79 organisations fully \ncompleted the requirements of the study. Of the 79 \nparticipating organisations 74 were from the UK local \ngovernment sector. The other 5 were made up of 1 US \nuniversity, 1 FTSE-100 company and 3 international research \norganisations.  \n \nRole % \nProject Management 12.89 \nContent Expertise 12.2 \nAccessibility Testing 12.2 \nInformation Architect 10.45 \nInformation Design 5.57 \nContent Development 15.33 \nProgramming 12.54 \nGraphical Design 18.82 \nTable 2 Maintainer Roles in Study Two \nTable 2 shows the percentage breakdown of roles taken by \nthe web maintainers.

RESULTS \nThe results are now presented highlighting: the tools and \nguidelines used, the awareness of accessibility and the \nperceptions of specialists. \nA.

This was followed by version 2.0 \n(WCAG2). A much higher proportion of specialists used \nSection 508 and IBM\u2019s Guidelines than the web maintainers. \nInternal guidelines were used by 32% of the web maintainers. \nSuch internal guidelines might include other organizational \nrequirements such as branding and legal issues.  \n \nTool Type Maint. % Special. % \nStand alone  15% 42% \nOnline 49% 0% \nBoth 13% 58% \nDisabled Users 24% n\/a \nDisability Sim. 14% n\/a \nTable 4 Types of Automated Assessment Tools used by \nMaintainers and Specialists \nAutomated assessment tools assist those looking for \npotential accessibility barriers. Currently, due to the subjective \nnature of many accessibility guidelines, there are no tools \navailable that fully assess a web site for conformance[12]. \nThese tools form two main types, those which are available \nonline, where web page URLs are submitted to a server-side \napplication and tools that run on the machine of the individual \ncarrying out the assessment. Online tools were by more \npopular amongst web maintainers than specialists. Table 4 \nshows that 49% of maintainers relied completely on online \ntools to assess web accessibility. None of the specialists relied \nentirely on online tools and mainly used standalone versions. \nFeedback from this question in Study One resulted in the \naddition of two new categories of tools in Survey Two, the use \nof users with disabilities and software that simulates a \ndisability (e.g. hand tremors or low vision). Nearly a quarter of \nthe maintainers stated they used some form of disabled user \ntesting. What exactly this involved might be interesting for \nfurther research.  \nB.

Over 75% of the specialists said there was little or no \ninitial awareness within the organisations they come across. In \ncontrast, approximately 68% of web maintainers, rated \naccessibility awareness in their organisation as good or \nacceptable. Both groups agreed that few organisations had an \nexcellent awareness of accessibility.  \nC. Accessibility training \nMaintainers were asked who in their organisations received \naccessibility training. Table 5 shows the roles within an \norganisation and the percentage of organisations who offered \naccessibility training for these roles. It is clear that most of \nthose involved in content creation and editing were most likely \nto receive training. Programmers and staff involved with the \nuser interface also were quite likely to receive training. Very \nfew information architects and project managers receive \naccessibility training only 9% of the organisations provided \ntraining for those responsible the information hierarchy of a \nwebpage. \n \nRole % \nProject Manager 11 \nContent Expert 25 \nAccessibility Tester 10 \nInformation Architect 9 \nUser Interface Designer 14 \nContent Developer 35 \nProgrammer 27 \nGraphic Designer 15 \nContent Editor 6 \nTable 5 Roles which received accessibility training \nD. How specialists perceive maintainer\u2019s attitudes \nThe responses to free-text answers from Study One \u201cIn your \nexperience, how is accessibility perceived by web designers?\u201d \nwere categorised.

Common terms \nthat were used were, \u201croadblock\u201d, \u201cboring\u201d and \u201crestrictive\u201d. \nEighth IEEE International Symposium on Web Site Evolution (WSE'06)\n0-7695-2696-9\/06 $20.00  \u00a9 2006\n 4 \nEven those who offered more positive experiences included \nsome qualification such as \u201camongst standard based \ndesigners\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s getting better\u201d and finally one respondent \nafter stating that most of their experiences were with \nmaintainers who were \u201cpassionate\u201d about Web Accessibility, \nwent on to add \u201cbut I think that is unusual\u201d. \nE. Why specialists believe they were consulted \nSpecialists were asked \u201cWhy were you really hired \/ \ncharged with accessibility evaluation?\u201d Again the aim was to \nuncover what the specialists really felt the real reason why an \norganisation had invested in accessibility. The question had 5 \nset responses, of which respondents could select more than \none. Table 7 contains both the set responses available and the \npercentage of times they were chosen. Included in the question \nwas a free-text \u201cother, please describe\u201d option.  \n \nReason for being hired % \nAs a response to customer feedback 0 \nTo gain competitive advantage 10 \nLegal requirement 19 \nTo meet internal guidelines 66 \nSocial conscience 33 \nTable 7 Reasons for hiring an Accessibility Specialist \nSurprisingly, none of the specialists were hired in response \nto customer feedback. The majority of specialists (66%) were \nhired because of internal guidelines and 33% of the specialists \nhad been hired through the social conscience of an \norganisation. Very few organisations (10%) apparently felt that \naccessibility would give them a competitive advantage over \nothers. Another unexpected result was the relatively few \nspecialists who were hired to ensure web sites conformed to \nlegal requirements. \nV. DISCUSSION \nThere will now follow a discussion of the results from the \ntwo studies. \nA. How accessibility is assessed \nAll the accessibility specialists used either WCAG1 or the \nWCAG2 as a reference to assess accessibility with the \nmajority of specialists using WCAG1. This was not the case \namongst the web maintainers where only 55% of those \nquestioned referred to the WCAG1 and 48% to the WCAG2. \nHowever, a very high proportion 92% of the web maintainers \nreported that they evaluate their site using one of the W3C\u2019s \nguidelines. Forty one percent of the web maintainers in study \ntwo reported that they used standards other than those set out \nby the W3C or in Section 508. These included; State of Illinois \nAccessibility Standards[8], RNIB See It Right pack[11], the \nIBM Web accessibility checklist[6] and internal or corporate \nguidelines. Many of these are combinations of and additions to \nthe W3C or Section 508 guidelines. For example, the Illinois \nAccessibility Standards aim to \u201cincorporate a combination of \nthe two (W3C and Section 508) creating a standard well suited \nto serve the users of Illinois web sites.\u201d[8]. The development \nof these extra guidelines based on current standards indicates \nthat some organisations are taking a more proactive approach \nto accessibility. By basing their internal guidelines on \ninternationally recognised standards they ensure that their \nwebsites meet the required accessibility levels. Because the \norganisations have more control on the content of their \nwebsites they are able to add further accessibility \nrequirements. \n1) Standalone and online tools \n There were differences too between the tools used by the \ntwo groups. The majority of specialists used standalone tools, \nwhereas amongst web maintainers the most popular approach \nto accessibility evaluation was to use an online service. One \nexplanation for this difference is that as professionals \nspecialising in accessibility, they require reliable tools they can \ntake with them to organisations and will work efficiently, \nregardless of internet traffic or connection speed. Another \nreason is limited resources. Only 6% of the organisations in \nStudy Two had a specific accessibility budget. Standalone \ntools are usually more customisable and can be changed easily \nto suit the specific needs of each project. Such tools also \nusually have more features such as more detailed reporting of \nresults.  All these advantages will help organisations get the \nbest value for the money they have spent on hiring a specialist. \nIf they have budgeted for a specialist\u2019s time, it is logical that \nthey would provide them with tools that will achieve their task \nmore efficiently. For the web maintainers, their focus is not \nexclusively on accessibility; they have other responsibilities \nand so use the evaluation tools on a page by page basis (i.e. \none page is assessed at a time and not as part of a batch). As \nsuch, online tools are perfectly adequate for their needs. They \nare free and quickly highlight areas that definitely need \nattention. One barrier detection method that was not first \nconsidered in Study One was the use of users with disabilities \nto assess web pages. However, after conducting Study One the \nauthors were contacted by a specialist who used a team of \nusers with disabilities as testers. This technique will obviously \nprovide a realistic and comprehensive test, but has several \ndisadvantages. User testing is time intensive and expensive; it \nis also difficult to find users with a wide range of disabilities.  \nB. Accessibility awareness and perceptions \nThere was a significant difference between how specialists \nperceived accessibility awareness within organisations and \nhow the web maintainers surveyed perceived it. The specialists \nwere largely pessimistic about the state of accessibility, \nwhereas the web maintainers themselves held a more \noptimistic and positive perception. There are several \nexplanations for this divergence. Firstly, accessibility \nspecialists are employed by companies when things are going \nwrong or require attention. An organisation that has addressed \nthis issue and has staff, competent in dealing with and aware of \naccessibility issues is less likely to employ a specialist. So, it is \nmore likely that when a specialist is employed, it is to an \norganisation whose overall accessibility awareness is poor and \nEighth IEEE International Symposium on Web Site Evolution (WSE'06)\n0-7695-2696-9\/06 $20.00  \u00a9 2006\n 5 \nrequires improvement. This might explain why only 17% of \nspecialists reported acceptable or good awareness within \norganisations. Secondly, an accessibility specialist\u2019s main \nfocus is accessibility and so in comparison to their awareness \nof accessibility; a web maintainer\u2019s awareness is likely to be \npoor. Such specialists also have a vested interest in ensuring \nthat they have a job. If there were no accessibility problems, \nthey would not be employed. Finally, since the Web\u2019s \npopularity and usage has grown, the individuals charged with \nmaintaining pages have come from a broad spectrum of \nexpertise. \nC.  Diversifying web maintenance community \nMaintainers from a non-technical background may be less \naware of requirements of and motivations behind Web \nAccessibility. Many organisations reported that they have \nstarted to use Content Management Systems (over 75% of \nthose surveyed in Study Two), such systems make it possible \nto deskill and standardise web maintenance. One maintainer \nbemoaned the fact that although they could ensure web page \ntemplates were accessible, because the content authoring was \ndevolved, little could be done to prevent the habitual misuse of \nHTML tags in the web page content. This implies poor \nawareness of accessibility issues at the content creation level.  \nNot only must web maintainers be aware of accessibility \nissues, but if they are to address it effectively, they have to \nappreciate the benefits of good accessibility.  \n \nD. Web maintainer perceptions \nOverall, the specialists surveyed felt that web maintainers \nheld very negative perceptions of accessibility. Of course, this \nis linked to the perceived ignorance the specialists found upon \ncommencement of a consultation. If a web maintainer is \nunaware of the problems caused by poor accessibility or the \nancillary benefits offered by more accessible sites then they \nare likely to perceive the new rules as a \u201croadblock\u201d or \nobstacle to getting their job done. It is understandable that \nsome web maintainers might take a skeptical view on \naccessibility; the concept is still quite novel to most in the web \ncommunity. This obstacle can become reality if organisations, \npanicked by the prospect of a potential prosecution, focus too \nmuch only on accessibility, thus diverting time from the \ndevelopment of content or functionality. Hence, if \norganisations do not invest time in developing an effective \naccessibility strategy, followed by appropriate training for \nstaff, then any new measures imposed on maintainers will be \nseen as restrictive and unnecessary.  \nE. Accessibility training \nStudy Two revealed a lack of training for both project \nmanagers and information architects. Both these roles have a \nsignificant influence in the overall strategy of a web site and \nhence their understanding of this issue is crucial to the \norganisation. Managers without the correct level of awareness \nwill not allocate sufficient time or resources to ensure \naccessibility and hence make the task of content developers \nharder. \nF. User feedback tracking \nAn unexpected result from Study One was that none of the \nspecialists attributed their employment to a response to user \nfeedback. If we assume that the organisations in question had \naccessibility problems and hence required the help of the \nspecialists, then there are two possible explanations. Either \norganisations do not track user feedback from the web site or \nusers are unaware of accessibility issues and so fail to report \nthem. This raises an interesting question; do organisations \nreact to the needs of their users? Of the 79 organisations  in \nStudy Two, 67% had a process for tracking user feedback. \nFrom this it appears that organisations have started to monitor \nuser feedback, so perhaps there is a lack of constructive \nfeedback from affected user groups.  \nVI. CONCLUSIONS \nA. Perceptions \nThere appears to be diverse range of perceptions towards \nweb accessibility. Study One revealed that the accessibility \nspecialists found that most of the web maintainers they \nencountered held a negative perception of accessibility. Study \nTwo shows that there are a good proportion of web \nmaintainers who are carrying out good accessibility work and \nfrom responses their attitude towards their work appears very \npositive.   \nB. General levels of awareness \nBoth studies revealed poor awareness of web accessibility \nwithin organisations, which as the web expands to include \ncontent and input from individuals with a non-technical \nbackground, could mean that with each update to a web site, \naccessibility problems are continually introduced.  \nC. Current maturity of approach \nThis lack of awareness and the dearth of training at the \nstrategic level indicate the need for a mature approach. Part of \nthis is to ensure web project managers are adequately trained \nin accessibility and related issues. Employing accessibility \nspecialists to advise of improving a site once is not enough. \nNeither is merely producing accessible web page templates or \ninstalling an accessible Content Management System. If those \nadding content or creating pages include HTML which, while \nvalid, inserts accessibility barriers, then content will continue \nto be inaccessible to certain users. Specialists should rather be \nemployed at a strategic level, to help organisations integrate \nweb accessibility into their web publishing lifecycle. \nSpecialists involved in defining policy must be aware of all \nissues (such as internationalisation or branding) that might \nimpact on accessibility and so can tailor their \nrecommendations to accommodate these.  \nEighth IEEE International Symposium on Web Site Evolution (WSE'06)\n0-7695-2696-9\/06 $20.00  \u00a9 2006\n 6 \nVII. FURTHER WORK \nFurther work is required in capturing and building on the \nexperiences of web maintainers and accessibility specialists. \nStudy Two surveyed those with a more general view of their \nweb sites; however more investigation is required into how \nthose responsible for only updating content understand \naccessibility. More research is also needed into why \norganisations develop their own accessibility guidelines and if \nthese are of value to a wider audience. Guidelines are also \nrequired to help organisations stay aware of best practice for \ncapturing and efficiently responding to user feedback. Finally \na standardised taxonomy of web roles is required. The term \n\u201cweb maintainer\u201d is a broad term that covers a wide range of \nskill sets and activities.  \nVIII.
