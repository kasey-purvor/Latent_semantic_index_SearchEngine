The complex assembly\nof a spherical somite structure consists\nof sculpting a rectangular block of ho-\nmogeneous tissue into a discrete group\nof cells that form an epithelial layer to\nsurround loosely packed mesenchymal\ncells (Fig. 1F,G; Fig. 1G shows the same\ntissue visualized after\u0001100 min). Each\nsomite segment must be created in a\ntimelymanner so that the pattern prop-\nagates in the direction in which cells\narise to produce a repeating pattern.\nThe early spherical structure of somites\nis transformed to give rise to muscle,\nskeletal and skin derivatives and pro-\nvides a scaffold for assembly of the pe-\nripheral nervous system (Christ and\nOrdahl, 1995; Holloway and Currie,\n2005; Buckingham, 2006). The concept\nof relating somite segmentation to\nquantitative frameworks has recently\ngained popularity (Cooke, 1998; Pour-\nquie and Goldbeter, 2003; Baker et al.,\n2006a), primarily due to the correlation\nof a theoretical clock mechanism with\nperiodic gene expression patterns that\ntravel through the presomitic meso-\nderm (PSM) (Dubrulle and Pourquie,\n2004). However, there is still a great\ndeal to learn about the link between the\nmechanisms that ensure a repeating\nperiodic pattern and local cell rear-\nrangements that result in normal or ab-\nerrant muscle and skeletal morphogen-\nesis (Maisenbacher et al., 2005, Huh et\nal., 2005).\nTechnical advances in computation,\nmicroscopy and molecular biology\nhave allowed scientists to extend ob-\nservations made by pioneers working\nat the intersection of developmental\nbiology and mathematical biology.

This explosion of both\ncellular and molecular data has in-\nspired both excitement and anxiety in\nexperimentalists and theoreticians pos-\ning the question of how to best integrate\nall the data. In this review, we highlight\nrecent advances in our understanding\nof somite border formation and epithe-\nlialization discussed with advances in\nthe design of quantitative frameworks.\nCONVERGENCE OF\nDEVELOPMENTAL AND\nMATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY\nTO STUDY SOMITOGENESIS\nAt the level of an individual somite,\nthe cell rearrangements and cell\nshape changes present wonderful\nquestions of how to properly fit cells\ntogether from a rectangular block into\na curved epithelialized structure (Fig.\n1F,G). It is interesting to note that\nseveral ancient cultures worked to de-\nvelop, but, the Romans refined how to\nintegrate shapes of stones to produce\na semicircular arch (Wheeler, 2001;\nFig. 1D,E). The arch provides a means\nto resolve the structural forces such\nthat vertical loads become axial forces\nthat transfer the load from stone-to-\nstone to the foundation (Wheeler,\n2001). To construct a semicircular\narch from polygonal blocks of stone,\nthe Romans refined how to vary the\napical and basal lengths of a block to\nconstruct an arch of a given radius\nand curvature (Fig. 1D,E). The larger\nthe apical-to-basal ratio, the higher\nthe curvature and smaller the radius\nof the arch. The principles of a two-\ndimensional (2D) arch may be ex-\npanded to form 3D structures, such as\nan igloo (Fig. 1H). The construction of\nan igloo consists of using an open\nblock, with distinct apical and basal\nlengths, that when filled with snow\nand placed at a set distance and angle\nfrom a center forms a 3D structure\n(Huesers, 2004). Visual inspection\nwith 3D confocal microscopy and anal-\nysis in 2D suggests that cells within\nsomites may perhaps resemble the Ro-\nman blueprint (Fig. 1). But, curiously,\nhow does the embryo sculpt cells\nwithin a rectangular block into a\nspherical structure (Fig. 1E\u2013G)?\nEqually fascinating is how the somite\nsegmentation pattern is propagated in\na repeating periodic manner. Thus, a\nmajor goal of somite biologists is to\nunderstand how molecular mecha-\nnisms that control the production of\nrepeating structures within the PSM\nFig. 1.

He was a contemporary\nof Charles Darwin and sought to sug-\ngest to naturalists how mathematical\nconcepts and quantitative frameworks\nmay help guide the study of morpho-\ngenesis. He studied a wide variety of\npatterns in nature, from rates of\ngrowth, to forms of cells and tissues\nduring early cleavage cycles, and\nshapes of structures, including teeth\nand horns (Thompson, 1992). His\nmethods of analysis, developed within\na biological setting, would evolve fur-\nther with the help of innovative math-\nematicians who constructed hypotheti-\ncal model mechanisms to reproduce\nbiological patterns. Early mathemati-\ncal models suggested chemical and me-\nchanical bases for morphogenesis (Tur-\ning, 1952; Murray et al., 1983) and\nhelped to set the stage for a wide\nrange of pattern formation model\nmechanisms applied to segmentation\n(Meinhardt, 1977; Kauffman et al.,\n1978), and repeating, periodic struc-\ntures, such as somites (Cooke and Zee-\nman, 1976; Flint et al., 1978) and skin\n(Cruywagen et al., 1993).\nDiscrete modeling approaches,\nbased on the physical properties of\ncells and their interactions, have also\nemerged to study developmental sys-\ntems and provide a foundation to\nmodel somitogenesis. These ap-\nproaches use a cellular Potts model\n(Graner and Glazier, 1992), stochastic\nMonte Carlo simulations (Drasdo and\nForgacs, 2000), or cellular automata\nmodels (Deutsch and Dormann, 2005)\nand have been applied successfully to\nseveral biological phenomena, includ-\ning convergent extension (Zajac et al.,\n2003), early cleavage and blastula for-\nmation (Drasdo and Forgacs, 2000),\nand somite border formation (Ying\nZhang, personal communication). To-\ngether, these modeling efforts have\ncreated hypothetical mechanisms\nthat, when constructed in close collab-\noration with biologists and simulated\nwith biological parameters have pro-\nduced unique insights and helped di-\nrect new experiments (Murray, 1993;\nMaini et al., 2006).\nSOMITE SEGMENTATION\nSTUDIED WITHIN\nQUANTITATIVE\nFRAMEWORKS\nThere has been a long history of mod-\neling the processes underlying somite\nformation (Fig. 2; Table 1): from Cooke\nand Zeeman\u2019s clock and wavefront\nmodel (Cooke and Zeeman, 1976; Zee-\nman, 1974) to Meinhardt\u2019s reaction\u2013\ndiffusion model (Meinhardt, 1982,\n1986) and the cell cycle model (Prim-\nmett et al., 1988, 1989; Collier et al.,\n2000; McInerney et al., 2004), to name\nbut a few. Each model can account for\nseveral aspects of somite formation\u2014\nbut with the discovery of recent exper-\nFig. 2. The model mechanisms underlying somite segmentation. A: An illustration of the antero-\nposterior (AP) axis and the various stages of somite formation according to the clock and wavefront\nmodel. The posterior presomitic mesoderm (PSM; shown in light gray) is homogeneous and cells\nare undetermined with respect to their developmental pathway. At the level of the determination\nfront (depicted by the posterior-most dotted presumptive segment), the interaction of the clock and\ngradient specifies the chemical prepattern. Cells of the PSM that lie anterior to the determination\nfront will follow a specific developmental pathway, which cannot be altered by subsequent\nperturbation of the clock or wavefront. At the anterior end of the PSM, cells undergo changes in\ntheir morphological properties and condense to form coherent somites (dark gray segments). B: A\nschematic of the network underpinning the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling gradient. FGF8\n(F) acts in a negative feedback loop with retinoic acid (R): FGF8 accelerates the decay of retinoic\nacid (fi), whereas retinoic acid down-regulates fgf8 transcription (tail-headed arrow). The interac-\ntions between FGF8 and retinoic acid are represented in the mathematical formulation by the\ninteraction terms g(R,F) and h(R,F), and diffusion of FGF8 and retinoic acid takes place at rates DF\nand DR, respectively. Numerical solution of the mathematical model is shown on the right hand\nside\u2014with the gradient of FGF signaling receding along the AP axis as time proceeds (i.e., moving\nin a positive x direction).

Cooke and\nZeeman\u2019s original model postulated\nthe existence of a longitudinal posi-\ntional information gradient along the\nanteroposterior (AP) axis of verte-\nbrate embryos, which interacts with a\nsmooth cellular oscillator (the clock) to\nset the time at which cells undergo a\ncatastrophe (Cooke and Zeeman, 1976;\nZeeman, 1974). This represents a\nrapid change of state, such as the\nchanges in adhesive and migratory be-\nhavior of PSM cells as they form\nsomites.\nSupport for the existence of a seg-\nmentation clock came from the discov-\nery that several genes exhibit periodic\nexpression along the PSM, with cy-\ncling times equal to the time taken to\nform one new pair of somites\n(Palmeirim et al., 1997; Pourquie,\n2001, 2003). For example, during the\nformation of one somite, bands of c-\nhairy 1 and lunatic fringe expression\nsweep along the PSM, coming to rest\nwithin the newly forming somite. On\nthe other hand, support for the posi-\ntional information gradient came from\nthe observation that a gradient of fi-\nbroblast growth factor (FGF) signal-\ning exists along the PSM, with cells\nmoving anteriorly through the gradi-\nent as the AP axis extends. Cells are\ninitially part of a region where FGF\nsignaling prevails and are undeter-\nmined with respect to their develop-\nmental pathway (Dubrulle et al.,\n2001). As the gradient recedes, a\nthreshold level of FGF signaling,\nknown as the determination front, is\nreached and cells become committed\nto a specific developmental fate\n(Dubrulle et al., 2001; Saga and\nTakeda, 2001; Dubrulle and Pourquie,\n2004). With the discovery of such ex-\nperimental evidence, Pourquie and co-\nworkers proposed a revised version of\nthe model which is now widely ac-\ncepted (Dubrulle et al., 2001). In line\nwith the original model, they suppose\nthat the clock controls when the\nboundaries of the somites form, and\nthe wavefront of FGF signalling con-\ntrols where they form. Figure 2A illus-\ntrates the process of somite formation,\nas predicted by the clock and wave-\nfront model.\nMaini and coworkers proposed a\nmathematical formulation of the clock\nand wavefront model (Baker et al.,\n2003, 2006a,b), using the signaling\nbasis of the cell cycle model (Collier et\nal., 2000; McInerney et al., 2004). The\nmathematical formulation concen-\ntrates on modeling the role of the FGF\nsignaling gradient, and the resulting\ndevelopmental anomalies that are ob-\nserved when the gradient is per-\nturbed. There are emerging models\nthat concentrate on modeling the FGF\nsignaling gradient in more detail\n(Baker and Maini, 2007; Pourquie\u00b4\n[R.E.B., personal communication]):\nthese models consider the negatively\nregulating interactions of retinoic acid\nand FGF8, which have been shown to\nbe present along the PSM (Diez del\nCorral et al., 2002, 2003; Diez del Cor-\nral and Storey, 2004). Figure 2B illus-\ntrates the possible interactions be-\ntween retinoic acid and FGF8 that\nlead to gradient formation. The math-\nematical model of Baker and Maini is\noutlined, and results of numerical\nsimulation of the model are also\nshown (further details in Fig. 2 legend\nand Baker and Maini, 2007).\nIn contrast, other models for somi-\ntogenesis have concentrated on under-\nstanding the mechanisms underlying\nthe segmentation clock. For example,\nMonk and Lewis have each proposed\nmodels in which transcriptional and\ntranslational delay drive oscillations\nin simple feedback inhibition loops\nwhere the protein product down-regu-\nlates its own gene expression (Monk,\n2003; Lewis, 2003; Giudicelli and\nLewis, 2004). Figure 2C illustrates the\npossible interactions between mRNA\nand protein that lead to clock oscilla-\ntions. The mathematical models of\nMonk and Lewis are outlined, and re-\nsults of numerical simulation of the\nmodels are also shown (further details\nin Fig. 2 legend and Monk, 2003;\nLewis, 2003; Giudicelli and Lewis,\n2004). More recently, Horikawa and\ncolleagues investigated the coupling of\nsegmentation clocks within individual\nPSM cells by means of Notch-depen-\ndent intercellular communication reg-\nulated by the internal hairy oscillator.\nThey showed, using a combination of\nexperimental methods and modeling,\nthat this could lead to synchronized\noscillations robust to the presence of\nnoise (Horikawa et al., 2006).\nThe current models have been\nlargely successful in replicating exper-\nimentally observed results; however,\nthere are three main areas in which\nfurther focus is required. The first is\nthat none of the current models fully\nintegrate the mechanisms underlying\nthe clock and the wavefront: the mod-\nels of Maini and coworkers assume a\nsimple readout from the clock in the\nform of a switch, whereas the wave-\nfront plays no part in the oscillator\nmodels proposed by Monk (2003) and\nLewis (2003). Second, experimental\nevidence has shown that the clock and\nwavefront may be intricately linked\nby an underlying gradient of Wnt3a\nalong the PSM (Aulehla et al., 2003;\nAulehla and Herrmann, 2004): a gra-\ndient of Wnt signaling acts upstream\nof the FGF8 gradient, and Wnt signal-\ning also acts in a negative feedback\nloop with the cycling gene Axin2 in the\nmouse PSM. Future models should\ntake this factor into account.\nThe third way in which these mod-\nels do not completely capture the phe-\nnomena of somite formation is that\nthey only account for the formation of\nthe prepattern of gene expression vi-\nsualized before any morphological\nchanges take place. The increase in\ncell adhesion molecules and subse-\nquent cell rearrangements have not\nbeen extensively investigated. Schnell\net al. (2002) were the first to develop a\nmathematical model to describe the\nbulk movements of somitic cells to\nform a somite in response to an in-\ncrease in cell adhesion. However, the\ndrawbacks of this model are that it is\nan extension of the cell cycle model for\nsomitogenesis and it does not take\ninto account the intercellular mechan-\nical forces involved in somite forma-\ntion. It would be possible to incorpo-\nrate the mechanism of cell adhesion\ninto the mathematical formulation of\nthe clock and wavefront model by as-\nsuming that cells produce adhesion\nmolecules, and\/or preferentially direct\ntheir migration according to the ge-\nnetic prepattern predicted by the mod-\nel; this is the subject of current work\n(Armstrong et al., 2006; Armstrong et\nal., [R.E.B., personal communication];\nYing Zhang et al., personal communi-\ncation).\nRecently, oscillations of the snail\ngenes, independent of Notch signal-\ning, have been shown in the PSM\n(Dale et al., 2006). Cyclic mRNA ex-\npression of Snail1 (mouse) and Snail2\n(chick) in the PSM appear to require\n1396 KULESA ET AL.\nWnt and Fgf signaling. Results sug-\ngest that one role of the snail genes is\nto integrate the Notch, Wnt, and Fgf\npathways (Dale et al., 2006). Further-\nmore, new microarray studies of the\nmouse PSM transcriptome reveal that\nthe oscillator associated with this pro-\ncess drives the periodic expression of a\nlarge network of cyclic genes involved\nin cell signaling (Dequeant et al.,\n2006); however, it seems that the os-\ncillator largely relies on the three\npathways, Notch, Wnt, and Fgf. How\nmultiple components of the oscillator\nare functionally coordinated with the\nwavefront to produce a precise assem-\nbly line of structures will be a future\nchallenge to the mathematical model-\ning of somite segmentation.\nVARIATIONS IN SOMITE\nBORDER FORMATION\nThe formation of a new somite is ac-\ncomplished by the physical separation\nof tissue, and the coalescing of cells,\nleading to the establishment of a sta-\nble border within the PSM. Explora-\ntion of the cellular rearrangements\nunderlying the formation of the\nsomite border shows that there are\ndifferences between animal model sys-\ntems and how aggressively the new\nsomite pulls apart from the PSM. In\nXenopus, a recent very detailed 3D\nconfocal analysis of embryos confirms\nearlier explant observations (Wilson\net al., 1989) that the expansion of\nshort discrete fissures (Fig. 3B) acts to\ngently bisect the PSM to form a stable\nsomite border (Afonin et al., 2006).\nSimilarly, in zebrafish, cell rearrange-\nments within a forming somite are\nminimal and a somite border forms\nwhen cells appear to gently detach\nfrom neighbors along a medio-to-lat-\neral direction (Fig. 3B) and do an\nabout face toward the respective\nsomite center or PSM (Wood and\nThorogood, 1994; Henry et al., 2000;\nJiang et al., 2000).\nIn chick embryos, the cell rear-\nrangements during somite border\nformation are more dramatic. Somi-\ntogenesis occurs in a precise spatio-\ntemporal order and is not a simple,\nstraightforward slicing of the PSM\n(Kulesa and Fraser, 2002). Time-lapse\nanalyses reveal that a somite pulls\napart from the PSM in a ball-and-\nsocket tissue separation (Fig. 3B); a\nseries of complex movements in which\ncells move across the presumptive\nsomite boundary and violate gene\nexpression boundaries thought to\ncorrelate with the site of the somite\nboundary (Kulesa and Fraser, 2002).\nCareful tissue transplantation studies\nhave shown that cells in the chick\nPSM, in the region near the presump-\ntive posterior border or caudal portion\nof the ball (and socket), possess border\nforming signals that are mediated by\nNotch and confined by Lunatic fringe\n(Sato et al., 2002). Further analysis of\nthe presumptive posterior somite bor-\nder cells has revealed that the ventral-\nmost cells are sufficient to induce an\nectopic border in a unidirectional\nmanner (Sato and Takahashi, 2005).\nThus, in chick, the initial separation\nof a somite from the PSM appears to\noccur in a ventral-to-dorsal direction\nthat involves complex cell rearrange-\nments.\nHow do we reconcile the differences\nin cell rearrangements between ani-\nmal model systems with gene expres-\nsion boundaries that appear similar\nduring somite border formation? If the\ncell rearrangements are different be-\ntween animal models, is the underly-\ning molecular choreography different\nor is the variation due to aspects of\ncell adhesion and\/or local microenvi-\nFig. 3.

Our under-\nstanding of the coordination of these\nfactors studied within a quantitative\nframework could help to identify the\ncrucial mechanisms by which the\nsomite separates from the PSM.\nLOCAL QUANTITATIVE\nFRAMEWORKS OF THE\nSOMITE\nMICROENVIRONMENT TO\nSTUDY BORDER\nFORMATION AND\nEPITHELIALIZATION\nWe have previously mentioned that\nthe prevailing model of somitogenesis\nsupposes that the PSM is segmented\ninto somites by a clock and wavefront\nmechanism. During segmentation,\nmesenchymal cells undergo compac-\ntion, followed by a detachment of the\npresumptive somite from the rest of\nthe PSM and the subsequent morpho-\nlogical changes leading to rounded\nsomites. Thus, at the level of an indi-\nvidual somite, cell adhesion, cell con-\ntact-dependent repulsion and cell re-\narrangements compete within the\nsomite microenvironment. However,\nthe actual process of somite formation,\nthat is how a somite separates or pulls\napart from the PSM and the ensuing\nmorphological changes, are not well\nunderstood and have not been the sub-\nject of mathematical modeling to date.\nRecent investigations of the somite\nborder have focused on integrin\u2013fi-\nbronectin interactions (reviewed in\ndetail in Chong and Jiang, 2005). Fi-\nbronectin is found at chick (Duband et\nal., 1987) and zebrafish (Crawford et\nal., 2003) somite boundaries; in the\nlatter case their accumulation is de-\npendent on integrinalpha5 (Julich et\nal., 2005; Koshida et al., 2005). In ze-\nbrafish embryos deficient for both fi-\nbronectin and integrinalpha5, somite\nboundaries are initially formed but\nare not maintained, suggesting their\nrole in boundary maintenance (Ko-\nshida et al., 2005).\nRecent experimental evidence shows\nthat segmentation requires a complex,\nlarge-scale coordinated movement of\ncells and extracellular matrix (ECM).\nThe ECM filaments have a reproduc-\nible morphogenic destiny that is char-\nacterized by directed transport (Czi-\nrok et al., 2004). Fibrillin 2 particles\ninitially deposited in the PSM are\ntranslocated along an unexpected tra-\njectory where they eventually poly-\nmerize into an intricate scaffold of ca-\nbles parallel to the AP axis (Czirok et\nal., 2004). The cables coalesce near the\nmidline before the appearance of the\nnext-formed somite. This experimen-\ntal observation suggests that cells\nduring segmentation migrate within\nthe ECM, and on other cells, generat-\ning long-range mechanical traction\nforces that will lead to the formation\nof somites.\nSomite formation is also regulated\nby members of the Ena\/VASP family\nof actin regulatory proteins and FAK,\nas shown during Xenopus develop-\nment. Kragtorp and Miller (2006)\nhave found that inhibition of Ena\/\nVASP or FAK leads to abnormal\nsomite rotation and failure to form\nintersomitic boundaries. Ena\/VASP\nproteins appear to act as a molecular\nlink between cell-surface integrins\nand the actin cytoskeleton to orches-\ntrate changes in adhesive strength\nand cell motility (Schlaepfer and Mi-\ntra, 2004). Another potential mecha-\nnism by which these proteins might\nregulate cell motility is through acti-\nvation of integrin adhesion and fi-\nbronectin matrix assembly (Kragtorp\nand Miller, 2006).\nIn avian and murine embryos,\nsomite formation is preceded by com-\npaction of the newly formed somite\nregion, s0 (that is, a reduction of the\nintercellular spaces between cells),\nand the simultaneous heightened ex-\npression of two types of cadherin mol-\necules, N-CAM and N-cadherin (Du-\nband et al., 1987; Kimura et al., 1995).\nThese two molecules are also ex-\npressed in the remainder of the PSM\nbut at reduced levels. Of interest, cad-\nherin-11 expression is strictly corre-\nlated with s0 and is not expressed in\nother parts of the mouse PSM\n(Kimura et al., 1995). Such could also\nbe the case in avians and zebrafish,\nperhaps through the expression of a\ndifferent cellular adhesion molecule.\nThus, it may be hypothesized that the\nexpression of different adhesion mole-\ncules and the modulation of cadherin\nquantity may be linked to the morpho-\ngenetic changes in somite formation.\nSimilar conjectures have previously\nbeen put forward (Newman, 1993) and\nmore recently (Murakami et al., 2006)\nfor somitogenesis in zebrafish. The\nregulation of cell adhesion molecules\nhas been linked to the protocadherin,\npapc, shown to play an important role\nin the formation of the epithelium\nalong the segmental border (Rhee et\nal., 2003).\nDespite all the experimental evi-\ndence, there is no model mechanism\nthat takes into account the subcellular\nprocesses mentioned above that may\nbe pivotal to somite border formation\nand epithelialization. We illustrate a\nmodel mechanism framework that in-\ncludes cell shape changes, cell\u2013cell in-\nteractions, and ECM deformations\nthat lead to and respond to cell ar-\nrangements (Fig. 3A). The experi-\nments of Czirok and colleagues (2004)\nillustrate that the ECM is a fibrous\nmaterial, capable of transmitting\nstresses over several hundred cell di-\nameters. Curiously, previous mech-\nanochemical models developed to ex-\nplain mesenchymal morphogenesis\n(Murray et al., 1983; Oster et al.,\n1983) may serve as a basic framework\nfor new mathematical models of\nsomite formation. Models of this form\ncan help to explain the interactions\nbetween cells and the ECM, and the\nresulting forces that are generated as\ncells extend filopodia and adhere to\nthe ECM. In this model mechanism,\ncell rearrangement and pattern spec-\nification are coupled, but the promi-\nnent mechanisms driving cell move-\nment are force-generated by the\nregulation of cell adhesion and shape.\nThus, improved insights into the\nmechanisms that govern somite bor-\nder formation and epithelialization,\nstudied within this type of local model\nframework, might be relevant for the\nidentification of interactions of cell\nadhesion regulation, cell rearrange-\nments and the ECM.\nTARGETING SOMITE\nEPITHELIALIZATION\nThe subsequent step of somite seg-\nmentation involves a morphological\nprocess that includes cell shape\nchanges and cell alignment to give\neach somite an initial characteristic\nstructure (Fig. 1F,G). In most verte-\nbrates, subgroups of mesenchymal\ncells dynamically alter their shape to\nform an outer epithelial layer enclos-\ning a mesenchymal core (Duband et\n1398 KULESA ET AL.\nal., 1987). This mesenchymal-to-epi-\nthelial transition (MET) of cells\nwithin a somite is distinct from the\nsegment border formation, as was\nshown by the knockdown of Paraxis in\nmouse (Burgess et al., 1996). Paraxis\nis likely regulated in part by ectoder-\nmal and neural tube derived signals\n(Sosic et al., 1997; Schmitt et al.,\n2004), and its expression is a consis-\ntent marker for the onset of the epi-\nthelialization process.\nNew studies of somite epithelializa-\ntion have focused on events in the an-\nterior PSM. Mesp1 and Mesp2, homol-\nogous basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix (bHLH)\ntranscription factors, are expressed in\nthe anterior PSM just before somite\nformation (Saga and Takeda, 2001).\nIn chimeric experiments, where mu-\ntant cells are aggregated with wild-\ntype cells at the eight-cell stage and\ntransplanted into a wild-type host,\nMesp1\/Mesp2 double-null cells do not\ncontribute to an epithelial somite,\nsuggesting a cell-autonomous behav-\nior (Takahashi et al., 2005a).\nHowever, the epithelial pattern of\nwild-type cells is disrupted, suggest-\ning a non\u2013cell-autonomous affect me-\ndiated by cellular interactions (Taka-\nhashi et al., 2005a). Interestingly,\noverexpression of Snail2 in the chick\nPSM prevents the expression of the\nMesp2 homolog, Meso1, and is accom-\npanied by a down-regulation of\nParaxis (Dale et al., 2006). Thus,\nSnail2 appears to have a second role\nin controlling the morphogenetic pro-\ncesses associated with epithelializa-\ntion (Dale et al., 2006). Transcrip-\ntional regulation of Mesp2 can also\noccur by means of the T-box transcrip-\ntion factor, Tbx6 (Yasuhiko et al.,\n2006).\nAt the individual cell level, the tran-\nsition of cell shape that is crucial for\nepithelialization involves the rear-\nrangement of the cytoskeleton. The\nRho family of small GTPases, includ-\ning Cdc42 and Rac1, mediate the nec-\nessary forces for changes of polarity,\nmotility, and structural stability of\nthe cell (Etienne-Manneville, 2004). It\nhas been shown recently in chick that\nwhen Cdc42 is overexpressed in the\nPSM, cells remain mesenchymal (Na-\nkaya et al., 2004). In contrast, when\ninhibition of endogenous Cdc42 is per-\nformed by overexpression of the CRIB\ndomain of N-WASP, cells in the PSM\nare hyperepithelialized (Nakaya et\nal., 2004). From this, Takahashi and\ncolleagues proposed a binary switch\nmechanism based on Cdc42 activity\nlevels such that low levels produce ep-\nithelialized cells (Takahashi et al.,\n2005b). Further insights may come\nfrom new imaging technology to visu-\nalize the dynamics of Cdc42 activity in\nliving cells (Nalbant et al., 2004) and\nmathematical models of Cdc42 activ-\nity regulation (Ozbudak et al., 2005)\napplied to cell shaping during epithe-\nlialization.\nDo the complex molecular signals\nthat sculpt an epithelial somite prop-\nagate in a precise spatiotemporal\nmanner from a specific location or oc-\ncur uniformly throughout the somite\nat a precise time? There are at least\ntwo possibilities. First, signaling mol-\necules may act on the somite and es-\ntablish a secondary epithelialization\nsignal source located near the center\nof each somite. This would act as an\norganizer to radially align the cells\ntoward the somite center and stimu-\nlate the cells to elongate toward the\ncenter. Second, signals may be local-\nized and influence a subset of cells\nthat, in turn, through cell\u2013cell\ncrosstalk and mechanical re-arrange-\nment propagate to form an epithelial\nsomite.\nSome preliminary evidence exists to\naddress the epithelialization order. In-\nterestingly, although Xenopus somites\nundergo a 90-degree rotation but do\nnot epithelialize, time-lapse analyses\nshowed that individual cells bend in a\nprecise spatiotemporal manner that\npropagates in a dorsal-to-ventral di-\nrection (Afonin et al., 2006). In a sim-\nilar manner, in analysis of histological\nsections from the chick PSM (Duband\net al., 1987; Sato et al., 2002; Nakaya\net al., 2004), the presumptive poste-\nrior border, including the dorsal, ven-\ntral, medial, and lateral sleeves of the\nnew somite, appear epithelialized.\nSato and Takahashi (2005) later re-\nvealed that the ventral-to-dorsal prop-\nagation of tissue separation is accom-\npanied by an epithelial morphology of\ncells along the somite border. To-\ngether, these static studies offer the\ntemptation to suggest that epithelial-\nization propagates from discrete re-\ngions within the somite.\nTo test the spatiotemporal manner\nof epithelialization, we used an em-\nbryonic chick model. Confocal time-\nlapse imaging revealed two significant\nobservations. When fluorescently la-\nbeled chick embryos were monitored\nin time-lapse, cell shape changes in\nthe newly formed somite propagate\nfrom cell-to-cell around the somite cir-\ncumference to give rise to an epitheli-\nalized structure (P.M.K. and S.R., un-\npublished observations). In current\nstudies, when the PSM is longitudi-\nnally divided on one side of the em-\nbryo into two equally sized portions\nand the tissue gently spread apart so\nthe cut sides do not contact, somite\nsegments continue to form in each\nsplit half of the PSM in a ball and\nsocket manner and cells align radially\nto epithelialize the somite, including\nmesenchymal cells in the mid-PSM\nthat normally remain mesenchymal\n(P.M.K. and S.R., unpublished obser-\nvations). Of interest, two half-length\nsomites formed when an ectopic\nsomite border was induced in the\nchick PSM by transplantation of quail\nposterior border cells (Sato et al.,\n2002). In addition, Freitas and col-\nleagues (2001) observed half-width ep-\nithelialized somites in the medial\nPSM in static experiments, but differ-\nently, half-width somites did not form\nin the lateral PSM when the medial\nPSM was ablated. These results sug-\ngest the normal epithelialization pro-\ncess is propagated (Sato et al., 2002;\nSato and Takahashi, 2005), occurs in-\ndependently of PSM width and mes-\nenchymal cells within the PSM are\nnot predetermined to a particular phe-\nnotype (Sato et al., 2002; Sato and Ta-\nkahashi, 2005). Thus, improved in-\nsights into the mechanisms that govern\nepithelialization, studied within the\nsomite microenvironment, may yield\nclues to the spatiotemporal program of\nepithelialization and cell specification.\nPERSPECTIVES\nThere is a need to elucidate the intri-\ncacies of the signaling pathways in\nsomite segmentation, which holds\npromise for yielding new targets to\nprevent muscle and skeletal birth de-\nfects. It is equally important to appre-\nciate the complexity of the oscillator\nmechanism and the intersection with\nother signaling pathways underlying\nlocal cell rearrangements and shape\nchanges during somite border forma-\nFROM SEGMENT TO SOMITE 1399\ntion and epithelialization. The latter\nprocess holds promise for yielding new\ninsights into cell specification during\nmesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions.\nIn this review, we have described re-\ncent biological work within the con-\ntext of the history of mathematical\nmodeling and novel quantitative\nframeworks to handle the emerging\ncomplexity of cellular and molecular\ndata on somite segmentation and epi-\nthelialization. Current qualitative\nmodels for somitogenesis can place hy-\npotheses and concepts into a rigorous\nframework to test the effects of multi-\nple, competing nonlinear effects. How-\never, a major challenge is to refine\nthese models from a qualitative to\nquantitative form that includes appro-\npriate parameter values and close in-\ntegration between modeling and ex-\nperiment. For example, significant\nheadway could be made by a better\nunderstanding of the mechanisms\nthat tie together the clock and the\nsomite determination front. Second,\nthe complexity of 3D cell rearrange-\nments, cell shape changes and cell\nalignment during somite border for-\nmation and epithelialization insists\nwe combine more sophisticated two-\nphoton time-lapse imaging and real-\ntime molecular readout. This strategy\nwill require quantitative frameworks\nto include the multitude of data com-\ning from microarray analyses and\ntime-lapse imaging, without compro-\nmising the strengths of existing\nmathematical simulations that have\nidentified key signaling component\ninteractions. Lastly, the rapid speci-\nfication of cells from mesenchymal to\nepithelial in normal and re-specifica-\ntion in operated embryos suggests\nthat cells within a forming somite are\nnot prepatterned to a specific pheno-\ntype and offer a paradigm to study\ncell\u2013cell interactions and cell repro-\ngramming.\nIn summary, we have gained new\ninsights into the potential of two\nquantitative frameworks to integrate\ndata across multiple spatial scales\nand the ability of cells in the PSM to\nrapidly re-specify between an epithe-\nlial and mesenchymal state to assem-\nble a complete somite structure. The\ndiscovery of key signaling pathways\nunderlying the precise spatiotemporal\nprogram of somite border formation\nand epithelialization coupled with\nmathematical modeling will likely\nyield novel strategies to suppress ab-\nerrant somite patterning. In ancient\nRome, architects who designed and\nsculpted the roman arches were re-\nquired to also be mathematicians (Sal-\ningaros, 1999). Perhaps at the cross-\nroads of work by developmental\nbiologists and researchers that build\nand simulate mathematical models\nwe will find equal success at unravel-\ning the biology of somite patterning.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nS.S. was funded by the NIH.
