The effects of energetic electron precipitation into\nthe auroral region at a time of enhanced solar wind have\nbeen investigated during a continuous period of 24 h, using\nthe European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar, an imag-\ning riometer, and particle measurements on an orbiting satel-\nlite. The relative effects in the E region (120 km) and D\nregion (90 km) are found to vary during the day, consistent\nwith a gradual hardening of the incoming electron spectrum\nfrom pre-midnight to morning. Whereas the night spectra\nare single peaked, the daytime spectra are found to be double\npeaked, suggesting the presence of two distinct populations.\nA comparison between the radiowave absorption observed\nwith the riometer and values estimated from the radar data\nshows generally good agreement, but with some discrepan-\ncies suggesting the occurrence of some small-scale features.\nThe height and thickness of the absorbing region are esti-\nmated. Two periods of enhanced precipitation and the related\nradio absorption, one near magnetic midnight and one in the\nearly morning, are studied in detail, including their horizon-\ntal structure and movement of the absorption patches.\nA sharp reduction of electron flux recorded on a POES\nsatellite is related to the edge of an absorption region delin-\neated by the imaging riometer. The observed particle flux is\ncompared with a value deduced from the radar data during\nthe overpass, and found to be in general agreement.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Ionospheric\ndisturbances; Particle precipitation)\n1 Introduction\nThe opportunity for this study arose from a more general in-\nvestigation into the terrestrial effects of enhanced solar wind\nCorrespondence to: J. K. Hargreaves\n(j.hargreaves@lancaster.ac.uk)\nrelated to the meridian passage of a coronal hole in June\u2013\nJuly 2005, further results of which will be reported else-\nwhere. A large coronal hole extending from the solar north\npole to the equator had been observed over several solar ro-\ntations, and, using the history and EUV observations made\nwith the SOHO satellite, together with solar wind data from\nACE (both at the L1 point), a prediction was made for the\ntime of its meridian crossing at the end of June and the con-\nsequent solar wind enhancement at the magnetosphere. Ar-\nrangements were made for the EISCAT radars to be operated\nat a time when ionospheric effects attributable to the crossing\nmight be observed.\nThe prediction proved to be accurate. The radar was op-\nerated from 10:00 UT on 1 July. The solar wind began to\nincrease at 13:03 UT at Wind and at 13:33 UT at ACE on\nthat day, and reached a peak velocity exceeding 600 km\/s at\n23:00 UT, thereafter declining gradually over several days.\nThere was no coronal mass ejection (CME) accompanying\nthis event. Terrestrial magnetometers recorded a sudden\ncommencement at 14:12 UT, which was followed by mod-\nerate activity lasting several hours. The Kp index was in the\nrange 4\u2212 to 4+ between 15:00 UT on 1 July and 03:00 UT\non 2 July, and the auroral electrojet index AE was enhanced\nover the same period, peaking at almost 1000 nT.\nThe present communication is concerned with the devel-\nopment and properties of energetic electron precipitation and\nits consequences observed over Northern Scandinavia during\na continuous period of 24 h. Topics of particular interest are\nthe relative magnitudes of effects in the ionospheric E and\nD regions, the spectra of the incoming particles, and related\nradio-absorption phenomena.\n2 Observations\nSeveral of the EISCAT radars in northern Scandinavia were\noperated to cover the period from 10:00 UT on 1 July until\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1838 J. K. Hargreaves et al.: D- and E-region effects in the auroral zone\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 1. D-region electron density observed with the EISCAT VHF\nradar on 1 and 2 July 2005. The time resolution is about a minute.\nContours are marked at 109, 1010 and 1011 m\u22123.\n10:00 UT on 2 July. The present paper uses results from\nthe 224 MHz VHF system at Tromso\u00a8 (69.59\u25e6 N, 19.23\u25e6 E,\nL=6.1), which was pointed vertically and ran a program\n(arc dlayer v) designed for D- and E-region observation and\ncovering the altitude range 60\u2013140 km. Due to its longitude,\n2 h 20 min should be added to Universal Times to get the Lo-\ncal Magnetic Time at EISCAT.\nThe imaging riometer system at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (69.05\u25e6 N,\n20.79\u25e6 W, L=5.9) operates continuously and measures the\nabsorption of the cosmic radio noise at 38.2 MHz (Detrick\nand Rosenberg, 1990; Browne et al., 1995). Having 49\nbeams it provides information on the spatial and temporal\nvariations in the D region and covers in all some 240 km\nnorth-south and east-west, assuming the absorption is cen-\ntred at altitude 90 km. In the present study it is used to in-\ndicate D-region consequences of precipitated energetic elec-\ntrons.\nTable 1. Reduction of electron density to 5-km steps.\nNominal height Range of values\n(km) averaged (km)\n60\u2013100 \u00b11\n105 \u00b12.5\n110\u2013115 \u00b11.5\n120 \u00b12\n125\u2013130 \u00b11.5\nThe POES series of NOAA satellites are in sun-\nsynchronous orbits at altitude 850 km (Evans and Greer,\n2004). Their instrumentation includes electron telescopes\npointing 9\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 from the vertical direction. For conve-\nnience these are called the 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 telescopes. At auroral\nlatitudes they are centred about 17\u25e6 and 102\u25e6 with respect\nto the magnetic field direction. Their reception cones have\nhalf-angles of width 15\u25e6. The data from each detector are\nanalysed to give the counting rate in three energy ranges:\n30\u20132500 keV, 100\u20132500 keV and 300\u20132500 keV. The count\nrate may be converted to the flux in cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 by mul-\ntiplying it by a factor of 100, which represents the geomet-\nric factor of the instrument. The four satellites are at differ-\nent local times, thus providing some longitude coverage; the\nnumber of measurements at a given location is also limited\n(and not always in a predictable way) by the orbital period of\n102 min. The particle measurements will be compared with\nionospheric behaviour during an overflight of Scandinavia.\n3 Electron densities in the D- and E-regions over\nTromso\u00a8\n3.1 Overview\nFigure 1 illustrates the magnitudes and variations of D- and\nE-region electron density as determined by the EISCAT VHF\nradar during the periods 10:00\u201324:00 UT on 1 July and\n00:00\u201310:00 UT on 2 July. The time resolution is 64 s, and\nthe radar returns were reduced to the stated altitudes by av-\neraging all values within a specified height range, accord-\ning to Table 1. The plots include contours at 109, 1010, and\n1011 m\u22123.\nSignificant activity began just before 16:00 UT on 1 July\nand it continued until about 08:00 UT on 2 July. There are\nseveral features that should be ignored. The apparent en-\nhancement between 11:15 and 11:45 UT on 1 July is almost\ncertainly due to a malfunction (I. W. McCrea, private com-\nmunication). Then, there occur intermittently throughout the\nperiod of observation intense echoes from about 85 km alti-\ntude which are \u201cpolar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE)\u201d\ndue to thin scattering regions in the medium rather than en-\nhanced electron density. Overall, the enhancements due to\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1837\u20131849, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1837\/2007\/\nJ. K. Hargreaves et al.: D- and E-region effects in the auroral zone 1839\ngeophysical activity are moderate rather than strong. We\nshall concentrate on the two periods of greatest disturbance,\none starting about 21:30 UT on 1 July and the other running\nfrom about 01:20 to 03:00 UT on 2 July.\nWe note in passing that the period 21:30 to 03:00 UT,\nwhich was the time of greatest geophysical activity, corre-\nsponded with an enhancement in the speed of the solar wind.\nAt 20:20 UT on 1 July the solar-wind speed at the Wind\nsatellite (1.66 million km from the centre of the Earth) was\n470 km\/s but it then began to increase sharply. Allowing\n57 min for propagation, the increase would have reached the\nmagnetopause about 21:17 UT, which was shortly before the\nonset of the observed evening event. The solar-wind speed\npeaked at 650 km\/s, and by 03:00 UT on 2 July had fallen to\n550 km\/s, remaining about that value until after 08:00. Dur-\ning the same period the solar wind had a significant eastward\ncomponent of 90 km\/s. There were no remarkable changes\nin the interplanetary magnetic field in this period, though a\nsector boundary went by (with some oscillations) between\n08:40 and 14:40 UT on 1 July.\n3.2 Noise levels\nAt the lowest altitudes (60\u201370 km) the electron-density data\nare noisy, with large variations from point to point and lit-\ntle evidence of sustained enhancements such as are observed\nat the greater heights. We assume that this represents the\nnoise level of the experiment, and it is found that at 60 and\n65 km the statistical distributions of \u201celectron density\u201d are\nclose to the Rayleigh form with standard deviation 2.85\u00d7107\nat 60 km and 3.60\u00d7107 at 65 km.\nBecause of the range correction in processing the radar\ndata, the noise expressed as electron density should vary with\nthe square of the range. Taking an average of the values\nfrom 60 and 65 km, it is estimated that at the higher levels,\nwhere signal dominates, the errors due to noise will be such\nthat 90% of values will be within 11.6\u00d7103(R(km))2 m\u22123\nof the true value. This figure varies with height between\n8\u00d7107 m\u22123 at 85 km and 2\u00d7108 m\u22123 at 130 km. Specifi-\ncally, the error should be less than 10% for electron densi-\nties of at least 8\u00d7108 m\u22123 at 85 km, or at least 2\u00d7109 m\u22123 at\n130 km.\n3.3 E- and D-region comparison\nThe 120 km level may be reached by electrons having energy\nof at least 1\u20132 keV. It is typical of the E region and the site\nof the luminous aurora. The 90 km level in the D region is\nthe one most affected by auroral radio absorption and is only\nreached by electrons with energies of about 25 keV or more,\nthe maximum ion production rate at that height being due to\nelectrons of about 50 keV.\nFigure 2 illustrates the relative E- and D-region activity\nat times throughout the observing period. The increase of\n120-km electron density at 16:00 UT probably represents the\nFig. 2. Comparison between E- (120 km) and D- (90 km) region\nactivity.\nonset of ionospheric activity resulting from the solar wind en-\nhancement, and the lack of D-region response indicates that\nthis activity in the afternoon sector was due to soft precipi-\ntation. Significant D-region activity such as may be detected\nwith a riometer did not begin until shortly before local mag-\nnetic midnight (\u223c22:00 UT), which is not atypical for the\ncommencement of night-time absorption activity. The pre-\ncipitation continued to harden into the morning sector, and\nabout 03:00 and 06:00 UT there were instances where the\nelectron density in the D region actually exceeded that in re-\ngion E.\nBased on the features in Fig. 2 several electron-density\nprofiles (Fig. 3a) have been selected for more detailed study.\nThe profiles shown have been corrected for a contribution\nfrom solar EUV radiation when the E region is illuminated.\nFor heights above 100 km, plots of electron density against\ntime show a smooth variation during undisturbed periods (i.e.\nbefore 16:00 UT on 1 July and after 04:00 UT on 2 July) and\na minimum level consistent with the trend during the activity.\nThe background due to EUV was estimated from that trend.\nThere are, of course, short term variations, but it can be\nseen overall that as time progresses the profiles move lower,\nwith the D-region contribution increasing relative to the E\nregion. Thus:\n1. 16:34 UT: In this feature the D-region (90 km) was\nweak relative to the E-region (120 km), indicating a soft\nspectrum. The enhancement at 120 km was about 20\ntimes that at 90 km.\n2. 21:48 UT: This feature was a short-duration enhance-\nment occurring close to magnetic midnight at EISCAT,\nfollowing a spike and within a night-time auroral ab-\nsorption event. The E-region enhancement was again\nmore prominent than that at 90 km (by about a factor\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1837\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 1837\u20131849, 2007\n1840 J. K.

The method entails some assumptions and\nuncertainties, so ultimate precision cannot be expected. It\ndepends on atmospheric models which may be inaccurate,\nand there are assumptions about the pitch-angle distribution\nof the incoming particles which generally is not known. But\nthe greatest scope for error arises with the height profile of\nthe effective recombination coefficient for electrons in the D\nand E regions. In the present instance the lower values are\ntaken from recent determinations (Hargreaves, 2005; Harg-\nreaves and Birch, 2005), and the upper ones from Gledhill\n(1986), with interpolation between the two sets at 90 and\n95 km.

Inter-comparisons are\ntherefore likely to be valid.\nA marked change of character is evident in Fig. 3b, in that\nthe spectra at 02:53 and 05:58 UT are double peaked, each\nat about 7 keV and 40 keV. The earlier spectra, at 21:48 and\n01:31 UT, are single peaked, the slope at higher energies be-\ning very approximately exponential (with characteristic ener-\ngies 4.3 keV and 6.7 keV, respectively). Such an approxima-\ntion is plainly not useful for the double peaked spectra, ex-\ncept perhaps over a very limited range of energy. The spec-\ntrum for 16:34 UT is exponential between 2.5 and 10 keV\n(with characteristic energy 1.2 keV \u2013 i.e. very soft), though\nthere appears to be a small flux of harder particles in addi-\ntion.\nIn summary, we find a tendency on 1\u20132 July for the in-\ncoming electron spectrum to harden progressively from the\nevening through to the morning.

The resulting profiles in the lower iono-\nsphere show the D-region effect increasing relative to that in\nthe E region, with the maximum moving to lower altitude.\nThe double peaked spectra may indicate the presence of two\npopulations of energetic electrons.\n4 The night-time event\nThe strongest D- and E-region disturbance of 1 July was an\nenhancement that started about 21:30 UT and lasted for about\nhalf an hour (Fig. 4). In the initial spike the electron density\nexceeded 1012 m\u22123 in the E region for a short time. The\nspike was followed by a more slowly varying enhancement,\ngiving the appearance typical of a substorm event (though\nsee later!). Another short-duration feature occurred halfway\nthrough the event.\nVertical profiles during the spike, during the short-duration\nfeature, and at a time intermediate between the two are shown\nin Fig. 5a. The profiles are similar in shape, peaking in the\nE region, though without much variation between 100 and\n130 km. The three derived spectra (Fig. 6a) display consider-\nable difference in intensity, the spike fluxes being at least 100\ntimes those at the intermediate point, but they all have ap-\nproximately exponential forms between 10 and 80 keV and\ntheir characteristic energies are rather similar, at 6.7 keV for\nthe spike, 5.6 keV for the peak and 4.9 keV for the interme-\ndiate point. The last spectrum includes a minor peak at 20\u2013\n35 keV which may or may not be significant.\nThe radio absorption at 38.2 MHz may be calculated from\nthe electron-density profile by applying the appropriate val-\nues of the height-dependent specific absorption coefficient\n(defined as the absorption per km due to unit electron den-\nsity \u2013 Parthasarathy and Berkey, 1965; Hargreaves, 1980).\nFigure 7 shows the height of the absorbing layer in terms of\nthe median and quartiles. During this period the absorbing\nlayer was centred about 95 km, and the width of the layer was\nsuch that half the absorption occurred over about 10 km of\naltitude. The total absorption calculated is also compared in\nFig. 7 with that observed in the beam of the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi imag-\ning riometer which most nearly intersected the D region over\nthe radar (which was pointed vertically). There is tolerable\nagreement except that the initial spike as observed was con-\nsiderably smaller than the calculated value. The difference\ncould mean that the feature in question was of small horizon-\ntal extent. The radar beam is only 1 by 3 km at 90 km altitude,\nwhereas the riometer beam covers some 50 by 25 km be-\ntween half-power points. A spatially confined feature could\nbe clearly observed by the radar but register only weakly on\nthe riometer if it failed to fill the relevant beam.\nWe can learn more about the nature of these features from\nthe absorption images constructed from the imaging riome-\nter. The panels in Fig. 8 each cover 240 km north-south and\neast-west at an assumed height of 90 km, and they are pre-\nsented as if viewed from above. A total period of 3 min\nincluding the initial spike event at 21:34 UT (21.57 UT) is\ncovered at 20 s resolution. The event is strongest in the south-\nern part of the field of view, and the maximum traverses the\nfield of view from west to east in just over a minute (velocity\nAnn.

This speed and duration are typical\nof spike events at the beginning of substorms (Hargreaves\net al., 1997), but the direction of motion is not. The most\ncharacteristic motion at the beginning of a substorm is pole-\nward. In this case there is some poleward progression which\nthen ceases as the event decays \u2013 all of which suggests that\nthis feature may be related instead to a \u201cpseudo-breakup\u201d\n(Akasofu, 1964). On these images the radar intersection is\nhalfway between the centre and the top left corner. The spike\nwhich the radar observes appears to be part of the poleward\nextension of the main peak, but its motion is clearly eastward.\nMaps over the period of the peak at 21:47 UT (21.78 UT)\nindicate a local intensification within an ill-defined pattern\n(composed mainly of weak absorption), but with a slow\nequatorward drift (velocity about 160 m\/s). Slow equator-\nward drift is not atypical in the later part of a night-time ab-\nsorption event (Hargreaves, 1974).\n(a)\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3\nTime (UT)\n108\n109\n1010\n1011\nN\ne\n (\nm\n-3\n)\n120 - 75 km, 0100-0315 UT July 2, 20s data\n120 km\n105 km\n90 km\n75 km\n(b)\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3\nTime (UT)\n108\n109\n1010\n1011\nN\ne\n (\nm\n-3\n)\n120 - 75 km, 0100-0315 UT July 2, 20s data\n120 km\n105 km\n90 km\n75 km\nFig. 9.

This period (Fig. 9),\nwhich is several hours after local magnetic midnight, starts\nwith a sharp onset after which the E-region electron densities\ndecline steadily with only minor fluctuations. By contrast,\nthe D region (particularly at 85, 90 and 95 km) shows con-\nsiderable structure, some variations being more than a factor\nof ten. (From Sect. 3.2, variations less than 2.108 at 130 km\nor 8.107 at 85 km should be disregarded as experiment noise.)\nThe effects are seen most clearly at the lower edge of the re-\ngion, whereas there is relatively little height variation within\nthe E region between, say, 100 and 120 km (Fig. 9b).\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1837\/2007\/ Ann.

The thickness\nbetween quartiles is still about 10 km. Between about 02:20\nand 02:40 UT (02.33\u201302.67 UT) the layer appears to be very\nnarrow, but this is an artifact caused by intense returns from\nPMSE.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 10 compares the calculated\n38.2 MHz absorption with that observed with the beam of\nthe Kilpisja\u00a8rvi imaging riometer which intersects the 90-\nkm level over the radar. The smaller values of absorption\nare comparable with the uncertainty of the quiet-day curve\n(QDC), and 0.1 dB has been subtracted from the observed\nvalues. Before 01:20 UT (01.33 UT) there are some negative\nvalues which are due to an error in the QDC, and until about\n01:40 UT (01.67 UT) the absorption values may be some-\nwhat too high from the same cause. Overall, and considering\nthat we are dealing with fairly small values, the observed and\ncalculated absorption patterns agree as well as can be ex-\npected. We again see a tendency for the computed values to\nshow sharper structure than those observed with the imaging\nriometer, and it is suggested that the cause may be the differ-\nence in spatial resolution between the two systems involved,\nthe riometer beam covering almost 1000 km2, but the radar\nbeam only 3 km2. Indeed, the argument could be reversed to\nassert that the closeness of the agreement indicates that the\nabsorption is relatively lacking in structure on scales smaller\nthan about 30 km.\n5.3 Profiles and spectra\nFigures 5b and 6b show electron-density profiles and spectra\ndeduced therefrom at 6 maxima during the morning event.\nThe profiles differ in character from those derived for the\nevening event (Fig. 5a), peaking lower and having a sharper\nunderside. The corresponding spectra have relatively greater\nflux in the 20\u201380 keV range. Some of the spectra are essen-\ntially flat up to about 60 keV, and by no stretch of the imag-\nination could they be described by simple forms such as ex-\nponential or power-law. There is also a progressive change\nduring the event, the mid-range contribution being relatively\nlarger in the later peaks than in the earlier ones.\n5.4 Dynamics\nThe absorption peaks within the morning events show gen-\nerally eastward movements as did the evening event dis-\ncussed above, but at considerably lower speeds. The fea-\ntures at 01:57 and 02:13 UT (01.95\u201302.22 UT) are the best\ndefined, and these are shown at 20 s resolution in Figs. 11\nand 12. The structures evolve as they move, which must in-\ntroduce some uncertainty into the velocity measurement, but\nthe presence of an eastward drift is clearly seen in each case.\nFigure 13 plots the position of the point of maximum absorp-\ntion within the field of view of the imaging riometer, as well\nas the maximum value. From this diagram the west-east ve-\nlocities are estimated as 372 m\/s (22.3 km\/min) and 750 m\/s\n(45.0 km\/min), respectively. In the south-north direction the\nmaximum remains close to overhead during both the absorp-\ntion peaks. For a short time in between them the maximum\nAnn.

In that study no structural detail could be\nobserved, so it is interesting that the present results are con-\nsistent with the earlier ones, falling within the inter-quartile\nrange. It is another confirmation that the observed motion\ncannot be due to the gradient-curvature drift of trapped elec-\ntrons, the basic argument being that electrons of sufficient en-\nergy (>50 keV) to cause the observed radio absorption would\ndrift considerably faster than is observed.

A mapping to the D\nregion would differ by only a few kilometers horizontally, a\ndistance well within the beamwidth of the riometer.)\nThe radar observations (Fig. 15) indicate that the event was\njust reaching the maximum when the crossing occurred, and\ntime variations during the pass were no more than about 30%.\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nSeconds from 0250 UT\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\nC\no\nu\nn\nt \nra\nte\nCount rates during the overpass\n0 deg telescope\n16-s average\n90 deg telescope\n16-s average\n(4.10**4)x(A**2)\n(2.10**5)x(A**2)\nFig. 16.

For comparison, the triangles show \u201cequivalent count\nrates\u201d, obtained by multiplying the square of the absorption esti-\nmated along the track at 3 s intervals by the factors 2.105 and 4.104\n(see text).\nThe counting rates from the POES 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 detectors for\nelectrons >30 keV are shown during the overpass in Fig. 16.\nBoth 16 s and 1 s samples are shown for each. (The basic\ndata are 1 s readings taken 2 s apart.) We note considerably\ngreater variability in the 0\u25e6 (almost field-aligned) telescope,\nwhich seems to indicate large variations in the pitch-angle\ndistribution of the >30 keV electrons. At time 60 s, the flux\nin the 90\u25e6 telescope decreases by a factor of about 4 but that\nin the 0\u25e6 telescope by a factor of 200. This drop coincides\nquite closely with the edge of the absorption patch (Fig. 14).\nIn considering this comparison it should be borne in mind\nthat the POES satellite is at altitude 850 km, that the absorp-\ntion is assumed (though with supporting evidence) to be at\n90 km altitude, and that the absorption map is based on only\n49 data points, each covering some tens of km. The spatial\ncomparison is probably as good as can be expected in this\nsituation.\nRelations between the fluxes observed in the 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6\ntelescopes will be discussed in a future communication\n(Birch et al., in preparation). We do not, however, expect\nto see the high variability of the flux in the 0\u25e6 telescope mir-\nrored in the ionospheric electron densities because of the re-\ncombination time (1\/\u03b1 N e, where \u03b1 is the effective recombi-\nnation coefficient and Ne the electron density), which is esti-\nmated to be in the range 8\u201323 s over the heights 85\u2013105 km\nin the present instance.\nDue to the geometric factor (10\u22122 cm2 sr ), counting rates\nshould be multiplied by 100 to obtain the particle flux. A\ncount rate of 104, for example, implies a flux of 106 elec-\ntrons cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121. During the first part of the overpass\n(Figs. 14 and 16) the 90\u25e6 telescope measured a flux of about\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1837\u20131849, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1837\/2007\/\nJ. K. Hargreaves et al.: D- and E-region effects in the auroral zone 1847\n2.5\u00d7106, while the 0\u25e6 telescope recorded a more variable\nflux averaging about 6\u00d7105. By conservation of the first in-\nvariant for trapped particles, all particles with pitch angle less\nthan 57\u25e6 at 850 km have mirror points below 60 km (assum-\ning a dipole field). We therefore have insufficient information\nfor an accurate estimate of the total flux reaching the D re-\ngion, but might suppose that somewhere between the 0\u25e6 and\n90\u25e6 readings would be most appropriate.\nThe triangles on Fig. 16 are derived from the absorption in-\nterpolated to points along the satellite track during the satel-\nlite\u2019s overpass of the imaging riometer (Fig. 14). It is as-\nsumed that the electron density, and hence the absorption, is\nproportional to the square root of the incoming particle flux,\nand thus the values plotted on Fig. 16 are proportional to the\nabsorption squared (A2). Constants of proportionality 4.104\nand 2.105 have been selected for comparability to the mea-\nsured 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 fluxes exceeding 30 keV.\nThe satellite did not pass directly over the radar beam\u2019s\nintersection with the D region, and so we must extrap-\nolate in order to compare the satellite data with results\nfrom the radar. At the point V on Fig. 14 the absorption\nwas about 0.55 dB. The corresponding count rates, accord-\ning to the above relations between absorption and count\nrate, are 1.2\u00d7104 and 6.0\u00d7104, i.e. fluxes of 1.2\u00d7106 and\n6.0\u00d7106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121. Inverting the electron density pro-\nfile over EISCAT for the minute beginning 02:50:24 UT\ngives a spectrum similar in shape to the later examples in\nFig. 6b, there being two maxima (at 6 and 28 keV) with\na marked dip at 17 keV. Summing the flux over the bands\ncentred from 33.6 to 95.1 keV (thereby covering 30.8 to\n103.7 keV between the band limits), then gives a total flux of\n7.6\u00d7106 electrons cm\u22121 s\u22121 sr\u22121, which, though somewhat\nlarger than the value extrapolated from the POES data, is rea-\nsonable agreement considering the various assumptions and\nuncertainties involved.\nThe relations derived above between particle flux and ab-\nsorption are consistent with those derived previously by Jelly\net al. (1964) and by Parthasarathy et al. (1966) under differ-\nent circumstances and using larger data sets.\n7 Summary and discussion\nD- and E-region activity has been investigated for a 24-h pe-\nriod using electron density measured by incoherent-scatter\nradar, cosmic-noise absorption observed with an imaging ri-\nometer, and energetic electron fluxes at 850 km detected on\nan orbiting satellite. Although it is not safe to generalise too\nfar from a limited number of observations, auroral electron\nprecipitation being a highly variable phenomenon, several in-\nteresting points have emerged.\n1. Precipitation occurring in the afternoon period is soft,\naffecting the E region but not, observably, the D region.\nThis helps to explain the well known afternoon mini-\nmum in the diurnal incidence of auroral absorption seen\nin riometer observations (Hargreaves, 1969).\n2. The spectrum hardens and changes character post-\nmidnight (in our case about 02:00 UT\u224804:20 MLT).\nIn the present observations the change occurred within\na short period of time. The double-peaked spectrum\nwhich appears in the morning period suggests the pres-\nence of two distinct particle populations.\n3. There is general agreement between the 38.2 MHz ra-\ndiowave absorption estimated from the radar data and\nthat measured directly with the imaging riometer, ex-\ncept that some short-duration features are more intense\naccording to the radar. The explanation probably lies\nin the difference of beamwidth between the techniques\nif the features in question are smaller than the riometer\nbeam in the D region. By the same token, we may in-\nfer that most of the absorption structures are larger than\nabout 30 km.\n4. The typical height of the absorbing region is deter-\nmined as 95 km pre-midnight, dropping to 90 km or\neven 85 km in the morning. Its thickness between the\nupper and lower quartiles is about 10 km in these mea-\nsurements.\n5. A spike event near magnetic midnight\n(21:35 UT\u224823:55 MLT) is interpreted from its\nmotion as a pseudo-breakup. The form of the electron\nenergy spectrum is essentially the same throughout the\nevent (21:35\u201321:47 UT) but there is a large variation of\nintensity.\n6. A morning event (01:20\u201302:35 UT\u224803:40\u201304:55 MLT)\nshows eastward drift, but at a speed much slower than\nthe gradient-curvature drift speed of electrons of the ap-\npropriate energy.\n7. An overpass of a POES satellite shows a sharp reduc-\ntion of >30 keV electron flux at the edge of an absorp-\ntion patch in the morning sector. The electron spectrum\ndeduced from the radar data is double peaked, and the\ntotal flux in the band 30\u2013100 keV is consistent with that\nregistered on POES. It is noted that the flux observed\nin the 0\u25e6 detector is considerably smaller than the 90\u25e6\nreading and much more variable in relative terms.\nIn recent years there have been a number of investigations\nof the causes and properties of D-region disturbances in the\nauroral regions using incoherent-scatter radar and riometers.\nThe former technique has enabled the height profile of the\nelectron density to be observed during energetic particle pre-\ncipitation, from which the height and thickness of the ab-\nsorbing layer can be calculated (Hargreaves, 1980; Ranta et\nal., 1985; Devlin et al., 1986; Hargreaves and Devlin, 1990)\nand the particle spectrum deduced (Devlin et al., 1986; Har-\ngreaves and Devlin, 1990; Burns et al., 1990; Collis et al.,\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1837\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 1837\u20131849, 2007\n1848 J. K. Hargreaves et al.: D- and E-region effects in the auroral zone\n1996; Collis and Hargreaves, 1997; Kirkwood et al., 2001).\nThe riometer technique using spaced instruments, and more\nrecently in the form of the imaging riometer (Browne et\nal., 1995), has improved our knowledge of the horizontal\nsize and form of the absorption patches and of their hori-\nzontal motion over short (up to \u223c200 km) distances (Harg-\nreaves, 1970; Hargreaves and Berry, 1976). Whether there\nexist structures smaller than the present IRIS beamwidth\n(\u223c20 km) has remained in doubt. The present work suggests\nthat some do occur.\nIt is well known that during substorm activity the spec-\ntrum of precipitating energetic electrons changes with local\ntime, tending to harden between midnight and noon. A re-\nduction in the altitude of the absorbing layer is a natural con-\nsequence. The present results are consistent with previous\nestimates regarding height and thickness in general, though\nthe gradual lowering of the height and the constancy of the\nthickness come out rather clearly in the present results. A\ndouble peak in the deduced dayside spectrum may be seen in\nsome of the previous results, but it seems particularly clear in\nthe present case. It is something of a surprise, however, that\nthe character of the spectrum changes from the night to the\nday form within such a short period of time. The observed\ndrift of the absorption patches is consistent with previous re-\nsults regarding both direction and magnitude.\nThe agreement between the drop in particle flux recorded\non the satellite and the edge of the absorption patch is to be\nexpected (provided the appropriated particles are being ob-\nserved). However, the greater variability of the precipitated\nflux relative to the trapped was not expected and is a feature\nworthy of further investigation.\nOn the broader scene this work is part of a study of the\nterrestrial consequences of events on the Sun and solar wind\nphenomena. It is well known that high-latitude radio absorp-\ntion is statistically related to the speed of the solar wind,\nits sector structure and to the orientation of the interplane-\ntary magnetic field (Hargreaves, 1966, 1996; Hargreaves and\nCowley, 1967; Kavanagh et al., 2004). The activity reported\nhere was associated with an increase in the solar wind speed,\nstemming from a solar coronal hole; there was no mass ejec-\ntion (CME). Although terrestrial magnetic activity was en-\nhanced between 15:00 UT and 03:00 UT the next day, sig-\nnificant auroral absorption did not begin until 21:30 UT. This\nabsorption activity occurred during a period of enhancement\nin the solar wind whose onset, it is estimated, reached the\nmagnetopause only 10 min before the onset of the night-time\nD-region event. The beginning of the velocity increase coin-\ncided with a southward turning of the IMF, and the delay is\ncomparable to, though a little smaller than, delays between\nsouthward turnings of the IMF and changes of magneto-\nspheric circulation pattern as reported by Hairston and Heelis\n(1995) during a three-day period in 1992. There were no ob-\nvious effects related to a series of sector boundary crossings\nwhich occurred between 08:40 and 14:40 UT on 1 July.\nThe prediction technique used to ensure the radar was op-\nerating by the time the disturbance arrived worked well, and\nhas the potential to be a useful aid to efficient radar observa-\ntions of solar-wind effects in the future.\nAcknowledgements.
