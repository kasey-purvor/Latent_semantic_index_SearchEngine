INTRODUCTION  \nDigital technologies in museums and cultural heritage sites \nare widely used to enhance and support the visitors\u2019 \nexperience. Mobile technology is also becoming increasingly \nmore popular in the heritage sector, with the result that many \ninstitutions develop applications for a variety of platforms.  \nMobile and smart-phone applications are rapidly increasing \nin number, because they offer great advantages as they: \n\u2022 Allow users around the world to download content \nbefore visiting the museum and to an extent preview \ntheir experience; \n\u2022 Eliminate interface issues, as everybody is accustomed \nto their own mobile phone;  \n\u2022 Free museums from maintenance costs and allowing \ninvestment in content development;  \n\u2022 Provide guided tours of various buildings or sites \nwithout the hassle of picking-up and returning audio-\nguides [1].  \nAmongst these, Apple\u2019s iPhone Applications (thereafter \niPhone App) are certainly playing a big role: from the first one \ndeveloped in 2009 by Antenna Audio Inc. for the Van Gogh \nMuseum [2], many museums and heritage institutions have \nreleased their iPhone App. Some of them are specifically \ndesigned to be downloaded before the actual visit, so that the \nvisitor can benefit of rich audio-tours, like the British Museum \none [3]. Others are instead intended to make available to art \nlovers a catalogue of the most relevant masterpieces to be \nexplored worldwide, like the iPhone App developed for the \nNational Gallery in London [4]. \nThe research briefly presented here describes the phases of \nthe development of an iPhone App to interactively present the \nstories of the people and the places depicted on the Summer \nWar of Osaka by!bu currently displayed at Osaka Castle \nMuseum. This paper also illustrates the future steps to \nintegrate the iPhone App with a Tiled Display Wall (TDW) \nsystem that acts as a \u2018virtual by!bu\u2019 and will allow testing \nvarious interaction functionalities. The application will also be \ntested and evaluated to understand its effectiveness for Osaka \nCastle Museum and its visitors. \nII. DEVELOPMENT OF THE IPHONE APP \nA. Aim and target users \nThe potential of iPhone App are multiple, from allowing a \nvirtual, interactive exploration of a museum, to providing \ncontent directly on the user\u2019s device. The latest one is \nparticularly appealing for Osaka Castle Museum, the main \ncultural attraction of Osaka.  \n \nFigure 1.  Summer War of Osaka by!bu: top, the battle of Osaka Castle (right \nscreen); bottom, the escape of the refugees (left screen). \n \nAmongst its vast collection, the Summer War of Osaka \nby!bu are the most relevant objects (Fig. 1). These painted \nwooden folding screens, which are listed as Important Cultural \nProperties, portray the events of summer 1615, when Ieyasu \nTokugawa defeated Hideyori Toyotomi and became the shogun \nof whole Japan.  \nOver five thousand people are portrayed on the two \nscreens: the right one presents the conquest of Osaka Castle by \nthe army of Ieyasu Tokugawa, whilst the left screen depicts the \nfleeing of refugees toward Kyoto and Hokusetsu [5]. \nThe events, people and places portrayed on the two folding \nscreens are extremely relevant in the history of Osaka and in \nparticular of its Castle. The iPhone App being developed for \nseeks to interactively communicate such heritage.  \nThe visitors of the Museum can already learn more about \nthe events of summer 1615 thanks to the Panorama Vision \n(Fig. 2), a multi-display presentation that briefly explains the \nrole of the samurai and some of the scenes portrayed. However, \nnon-Japanese speaking visitors have the hard task of reading \nthe subtitles on small lateral screens whilst watching the \nimages on the big screens. Hence, the iPhone App seeks to \nprovide the visitors with an interactive tool, entirely designed \nin English and, at the same time, the Museum with an \napplication that can be regularly updated and extended without \nthe need to maintain hardware. The target users are therefore \nthe visitors of Osaka Castle Museum, with a particular \nattention to the foreign ones.  \nB. Concept, design and development \nThe first stage of the development concerned the collection \nof data regarding the by!bus, the events, the people and places \nportrayed. Simultaneously, the needs and expectations of \nOsaka Castle Museum were investigated by interviewing its \nChief Curator, Mr Makoto Atobe. It emerged that the museum \nhas been introducing technology for public presentation from \nthe late 1990s and the offer is now quite diversified, ranging \nfrom audio-guides to a theatre for the vision of short videos, \nfrom holography to tiled display system (the Panorama \nVision). However, with the exception of audio-guides, which \nprovide very brief explanations of the collection and the \nmuseum\u2019s sections, the ICT deployed is entirely non-\ninteractive. This is mainly due to the large number of visitors \nper year \u2013 around one million \u2013 which would translate in high \nmaintenance costs if there were interactive devices lent to the \npublic.  \nMr Atobe also underlined the museum\u2019s effort in providing \nmultilingual tools for foreign visitors, from the audio-guides\u2019 \ncommentaries to the subtitles in Chinese, Korean and English \non lateral screens in the Panorama Vision and the theatre on the \nfirst floor. However, he also pointed out the desire to introduce \ninteractive experiences for the visitors: the idea of a mobile \nphone application was positively considered, as it would \neliminate the costs for the maintenance of the devices.  \nThe selection of the iPhone as platform was mainly \nmotivated by the constant growing number of Apps being \nreleased by museums and heritage sites, and the worldwide \ndistribution of these phones, which has been steadily raising \nfrom its first launch in 2007 [6]. \nThe design of the iPhone App aimed at providing the \nvisitors of Osaka Castle Museum with an interactive tool to \nexplore the Summer War of Osaka by!bu and learn more about \nthe events, people and places portrayed.  \nThe design of the interface was firstly realized using \nBalsamiq Mockups [7] to define the assets and the general \nlook-and-feel of the application (Fig. 3). \nThe layout and the navigation structure are intuitive to \nfacilitate the exploration of the application and its content \nwithout the need to memorize too many functions.  \nOnce assets \u2013 the various components, from pictures to text \nto video \u2013 and type of functionalities were defined, the iPhone \nApp was developed using Apple\u2019s SDK [8]. This software \nallows integrating the content within the desired navigation \nstructure and testing the application on an iPhone Simulator, \nbut also to perfect the design with the Interface Builder (Fig. \n4).  \nFigure 2.  Panorama Vision at Osaka Castle Museum. \nFigure 3.  Design of the graphical user interface of the iPhone App. \nThe iPhone App features short video clips, images and text \nand is divided into four main sections:  \n! The Introduction explains briefly to the users the \nfunction of by!bu in Japanese culture, the type of \nmaterial used and the styles of the decoration.  \n! The Osaka Castle Museum section provides general \ninformation, such as opening times and tickets, but also a \nmap to help locate the museum and access it using public \ntransport. The user can also find more information about \nthe parks surrounding the castle, very popular especially \nduring the blossoming seasons of cherry and plum trees.  \n! The section Summer War of Osaka by!bu is entirely \ndedicated to the two folding screens and is divided into \nthree sub-sections: an Overview gives information \nregarding the history of the by!bu and their conservation. \nThen two sub-sections are dedicated to each screen (the \nBattle of Osaka Castle by!bu and the Escape of the \nRefugees by!bu), illustrating in great detail the events \nportrayed, the people \u2013 indeed it is possible to recognize \nthe samurai leading the armies on each side of the \nbattlefield \u2013 and the places, such as Osaka Castle. \n! Finally, the Interact with TDW section will allow the user \nto interact with a Tiled Display Wall (TDW) system to \nvisualize the by!bu and their content, as explained \nthereafter.  \nIII. FUTURE WORK \nA. Integration of the iPhone App with Tiled Display Wall \nsystem \nThe Knowledge Creating Communication Research Center \nat NICT (Japan) and the Cultural Informatics Research Group \nat the University of Brighton (UK) have been experimenting \nwith Tiled Display Wall (TDW) systems to display cultural \nheritage applications and interactively navigate virtual reality \nenvironments [9] [10]. \nThe integration of the iPhone App with the TDW system \nwill allow experimenting with various functionalities, such as \nzooming in\/out to view details of the by!bus, but also testing \nthe gigabit worldwide network for high-definition images and \ndata sharing between the two institutions.  \nThe iPhone will act as interaction device with the TDW by \nusing a set of pre-defined actions, such as tapping on the \nupper\/lower part of the screen, double tapping, etc. The options \ncurrently discussed to integrate the iPhone App with the TDW \ninclude using the phone to select details of the by!bu from a \nmenu and then visualize them on the screens with brief \ndescriptions. Another option is to have the descriptions \ndisplayed on the iPhone whilst the high-resolution images will \nbe visualized on the screens (Fig. 5).  \nB. Usability evaluation  \nThe development of the iPhone App is part of a wider \nresearch that investigates the effectiveness of digital \ntechnologies for cultural heritage in various cultural contexts, \nby using a novel Comprehensive Evaluation Framework. This \nframework seeks to investigate perspectives, expectations, \napproach and use of different cultural heritage stakeholders \u2013 \nnamely managers, curators and visitors \u2013 to define a series of \nmetrics and tools to evaluate how effective is a piece of \ntechnology for them. It is clear that, since the perspectives and \nuse of technology is different depending on the stakeholders, \nthe aim of this evaluation framework is not to definitively label \nan application as effective or not. It rather seeks to present and \ndiscuss the multiple \u2013 and sometime conflicting \u2013 elements \ncombining in making it effective.  \nTherefore, the iPhone App will be tested to improve its \ninterface and general usability, through an expert review and a \nseries of usability tests with potential users. This iterative \nprocess \u2013 during which the feedback of each test immediately \nfeed into the implementation \u2013 will facilitate the development \nof a prototype that will be evaluated in the museum \nenvironment, to assess its effectiveness for Osaka Castle \nMuseum, but also the approach, behavior and use of Japanese \nand foreign visitors. \nFigure 4.
