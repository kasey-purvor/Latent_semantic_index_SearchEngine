INTRODUCTION 1 \n The effect of tide-surge interaction due to non-linear processes in shallow water 2 \nregions upon surge elevations has been known for some time (e.g. Prandle and Wolf (1978), 3 \nHorsburgh and Wilson (2007), Bobanovic et. al. (2005), Bernier and Thompson (2006) and 4 \nreview of Heaps (1983)).  However, the conventional approach of predicting total elevations 5 \ndue to tides and surges has been to linearly decompose the total into its tidal and surge 6 \ncomponents.  By this means the tidal elevation contribution to the total was determined from 7 \nthe harmonic analysis of long term (of order a year or more) observed elevations.  These were 8 \nthen used to accurately predict tidal elevations at ports.  The surge component was computed 9 \nusing a hydrodynamic model.  Initially these models used a coarse finite difference grid and 10 \ndid not take account of tidal effects (e.g. Heaps, 1965, 1969).  Since tide surge interaction is 11 \nnegligible in deeper water, and the grid of these models was so coarse that they could not 12 \nresolve nearshore regions then the neglect of tides was appropriate.  However, as grids were 13 \nrefined, and shallow regions resolved then it became necessary to take account of tides in 14 \norder to get the appropriate level of friction and interaction in the model.  In order to separate 15 \nthe surge from such a calculation, the model was run with tidal forcing only and this solution 16 \nsubtracted from the tide and surge to give the surge component.  The prediction of total water 17 \nlevel that was required for flood defence purposes was then derived by adding this surge to 18 \nthe tide derived from harmonic analysis.  In essence a linear decomposition was assumed, 19 \nalthough in shallow water such a decomposition was strictly not possible due to non-linear 20 \neffects. 21 \n The difficulty of de-tiding a tide and surge calculation in shallow water by subtracting 22 \na tidal solution was clearly shown by Jones and Davies (2007a).  They found using a number 23 \nof orthogonal wind components that the steady state surge elevation was significantly 24 \naffected by detiding the solution at high or low tide.  This arose because the level of 25 \n 4 \ninteraction between tide and surge depended upon the state of the tide, and how the surge had 1 \nmodified the tide.  Consequently de-tiding a tide and surge calculation by subtracting a tide 2 \nonly solution, left energy at the tidal period within the surge.  In addition observed surge 3 \nrecords in shallow water regions derived by subtracting a tidal time series (based upon the 4 \nharmonic analysis of a year long record) were found to contain energy at tidal frequencies.  5 \nThis suggests that besides tide-surge interaction influencing the surge it also modifies the tide 6 \nat the time of the surge in shallow water regions. 7 \n As the effect of tide-surge interaction upon the surge has been extensively studied 8 \n(e.g. Prandle and Wolf (1978)), as have the non-linear processes that produce this interaction 9 \nand hence modify the surge, namely the non-linear momentum advection terms, and 10 \nquadratic bottom friction, it is not our intention here to focus on the surge.  Rather our aim is 11 \nto focus on how tidal harmonics of both elevations and currents in shallow water regions are 12 \nmodified by the presence of the surge.  By this means it is possible to understand why a surge 13 \nresidual in shallow water determined by de-tiding a surge event using a tidal prediction based 14 \nupon a long tidal time series still contains energy at tidal frequencies.  In addition the extent 15 \nof modification of tidal constituents in shallow water depends upon location and wind 16 \ndirection and the processes determining this are also considered. 17 \n In essence the objective of this paper is to use a finite element model, namely 18 \nTELEMAC (Nicolle and Karpytchev 2007, Fernandes et al 2002, 2004, Heniche et al 2000) 19 \nwith an unstructured grid covering the west coast of Britain to examine to what extent strong 20 \nwinds, comparable to those that occur during storm surges, modify the fundamental and 21 \nhigher harmonics of the tide in shallow water.  As such it extends the work of Jones and 22 \nDavies (2007a) who only examined the surge. 23 \n The sea region off the west coast of Britain is chosen because it has been the focus of 24 \na detailed study over a number of years of processes influencing storm surges in the region 25 \n 5 \n(e.g. Lennon 1963, Heaps 1983, Davies and Lawrence 1995, Davies and Jones 1992, 1996, 1 \nJones and Davies 1998, 2001, 2003a,b). Futhermore the area covers a range of water depths, 2 \nwith deep water areas (depth of up to 150 m) to the north off the west coast of Scotland, and 3 \nthe North Channel.  In addition there are comparable water depths in the Celtic Sea and St. 4 \nGeorge\u2019s Channel (Fig. 1).  Storm surges generated outside the area of the model and in these 5 \ndeep water regions are intensified as they propagate into the eastern Irish Sea (Figs. 1,2) 6 \nwhere water depths are much shallower (on average of order 25 m, see Fig. 2).  In the 7 \nshallow eastern Irish Sea, there is significant tide surge interaction, and in shallow coastal 8 \nregions \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurs, depending upon the state of the tide and the intensity of 9 \nthe surge.  Since these highly non-linear processes are a maximum in the eastern Irish Sea 10 \nthis paper focuses upon how surge effects modify the tides in these regions. 11 \n The TELEMAC finite element code with the unstructured grid given in Fig. 3 was 12 \nused in the calculations since an accurate tidal solution was obtained previously (Jones and 13 \nDavies 2005, 2006, 2007b).  In addition the fine mesh in this model in the eastern Irish Sea 14 \nenables an accurate representation of interaction in this region to be modelled.  The model 15 \nalso incorporates \u201cwetting and drying\u201d algorithms (see Balzano 1998 for a review of methods 16 \nused in finite element models) that allow for an accurate solution in near coastal regions.  The 17 \nability of the finite element method to enhance the mesh in near coastal regions (e.g. Jones 18 \n2002, Walters 2005, Werner 1995, Legrand et. al. 2006, Levasseur et. al. 2007 and reviews 19 \nby Greenberg et. al. 2007, Legrand et. al. 2007)) makes it ideal for modelling studies such as 20 \nthe present one. 21 \n A brief description of the working equations is presented in the next section, with 22 \nsubsequent sections dealing with the influence of orthogonal components of the wind stress 23 \nupon the M2 tide and its higher harmonics.  The main findings of the study are summarized in 24 \na final section. 25 \n 6 \n2. THE HYDRODYNAMIC EQUATIONS AND MODEL FORMULATION 1 \n Following earlier work the domain of the region is identical to that of Davies and 2 \nJones (1992) (hereafter DJ92)and Jones and Davies (2005, 2006), and extends over a range of 3 \nlatitudes.  Following this work the two-dimensional form of the hydrodynamic equations in 4 \npolar coordinates is solved, namely 5 \n0U\n\u03c7\u03c6cosR\n1\n\u03c6cosV\n\u03c6\u03c6cosR\n1\nt\n\u03b6\n     (1) 6 \n\u03b6h\u03c1\n\u03c4\u03c4\n\u03c7\n\u03b6\n\u03c6cosR\ng\nV\u03c6sin\u03c92S\nt\nU\nb\n\u03c7\ns\n\u03c7\nu      (2) 7 \n\u03b6h\u03c1\n\u03c4\u03c4\n\u03c6\n\u03b6\nR\ng\nU\u03c6sin\u03c92S\nt\nV\nbs\nv\n\u03c6\u03c6\n     (3) 8 \nwhere Su, Sv are the non-linear momentum terms, details of which are given in DJ92. 9 \n The nomenclature used in these equations is \u03c7 , , denote east longitude, (positive 10 \neastward) and north latitude (positive northward), respectively, h depth below the undisturbed 11 \ndepth of water, t time,  elevation of the sea surface, \u03c1 sea water density, R the radius of the 12 \nEarth,  the angular speed of the Earth\u2019s rotation, g the acceleration due to gravity, U,V 13 \neastward and northward components of current, \nb\n\u03c6\nb \u03c4,\u03c4\n\u03c7\n, components of bottom stress given 14 \nby 15 \n \n2\/122b2\/122b VUV\u03c1k\u03c4,VUU\u03c1k\u03c4\n\u03c6\u03c7\n     (4) 16 \nwith k a coefficient of bottom friction, fixed at k = 0.0025.  At the sea surface the wind stress 17 \ncomponents \ns\n\u03c6\ns \u03c4,\u03c4\n\u03c7\n are specified. 18 \n The horizontal gradient normal to the coast of alongshore velocity was taken as zero.  19 \nIn shallow water areas \u201cwetting\u201d and \u201cdrying\u201d can occur within the tidal cycle.  Various 20 \noptions exist in the literature for doing this (see Ip et al. 1998, Fortunato et al 1997, 1999, 21 \nHeniche et al 2000 for a discussion of these).  The TELEMAC code option of removing the 22 \n 7 \nterms in the hydrodynamic equations which became physically unrealistic was used in the 1 \ncalculations.  This is consistent with methods used in finite difference models Flather and 2 \nHubbert (1989) and also by Jones and Davies (2006).  In the finite element model in shallow 3 \nwater regions where significant \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurs energy is lost to higher 4 \nharmonics.  At a closed boundary the normal component of velocity was set to zero.  The 5 \nopen boundary M2 tidal forcing was identical to that used by Jones and Davies (2006, 6 \n2007a,b).  In essence only the M2 tide was specified along this boundary, and its higher 7 \nharmonics were generated by non-linear effects within the region.  A detailed comparison at a 8 \nsignificant number, of order 100 coastal and off-shore gauges (including those used here in 9 \nsubsequent tables) showed that the model could accurately reproduce the fundamental and 10 \nhigher harmonics of the tide in the region (see Jones and Davies 2005, 2007b for details of 11 \ntide gauge locations and model accuracy).  In the wind forced calculations only tidal forcing 12 \nwas applied along the open boundary, and hence any external surge effects entering the 13 \nregion were excluded.  (A detailed discussion of external surge influence during a specific 14 \nsurge, namely November 1977 can be found in Davies and Jones (1992), although in the 15 \nshallow eastern Irish Sea local wind forcing dominates over the external surge).  The neglect 16 \nof external surge forcing, which varies significantly from one surge to another, is consistent 17 \nwith the aim of investigating how the tide in shallow water is modified by uniform wind 18 \nforcing over the region.  Solutions were determined in all cases by integrating forward in time 19 \nfrom a zero initial state over eight tidal cycles with both tidal and wind forcing.  A detailed 20 \nexamination of time series at various locations (see later) showed that a periodic tidal and 21 \nsteady surge response had been achieved by the fourth tidal cycle. 22 \n The final tidal cycle was then harmonically analysed to determine the amplitude and 23 \nphase of the M2 tide and its higher harmonics.  Differences between these analyses for a 24 \nrange of wind directions, and those derived from a calculation with only tidal forcing are used 25 \n 8 \nto quantify how the surge has modified the tide.  The steady state surge residual was 1 \ncomputed as the residual from this harmonic analysis and hence did not contain any energy at 2 \nthe tidal frequencies.  In essence the surge was derived by \u201cde-tiding\u201d the total using tidal 3 \nconstituents obtained from this harmonic analysis, and not from a \u201ctide only\u201d calculation.  In 4 \norder to understand the role that wind direction plays in modifying the tide, surge elevations 5 \nobtained by de-tiding using the tidal constituents derived at the time of the surge are also 6 \npresented. 7 \n3. NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS 8 \n In order to examine how storm surges influence the tide, calculations were performed 9 \nwith a steady wind stress of 1.0 Pa, corresponding to the strong wind forcing that occurs 10 \nduring a surge.  Initially (Calc 1, Table 1) a wind stress from the west was examined.  11 \nSubsequently an orthogonal wind stress from the north (Calc. 2) was used.  In a final 12 \ncalculation to determine the degree of linearity in the response of the tide, a wind from the 13 \nsouth (Calc 3) was applied.  In a linear system the response should be the negative of that 14 \ncomputed with the north wind.  In addition to examining the effect upon the tide, the spatial 15 \nvariability of the surge over the eastern Irish Sea is considered.  This was done in order to 16 \nunderstand how changes in total water depth due to the surge influenced the various tidal 17 \nconstituents.  As shown by Jones and Davies (2007a), in order to accurately compute the 18 \nsurge it is necessary to use a tidal solution derived from an harmonic analysis of the tide and 19 \nsurge at the time of the surge.  This approach was used here.  By comparing changes in tidal 20 \nharmonics in different regions produced by the addition of meteorological forcing in different 21 \ndirections then the importance of spatial variations in non-linear effects upon the tide can be 22 \nquantified.   23 \n3.1 Effect of a westerly wind stress of 1.0 Pa upon the tide 24 \n 9 \n Since the major effect of the storm surge upon the tide occurs in shallow water 1 \nregions, the focus will be the eastern Irish Sea, although the model computes the response 2 \nover the whole domain.  Before examining the effect upon the tide it is valuable to examine 3 \nthe storm surge elevation distribution over the eastern Irish Sea. 4 \n It is evident from the surge elevations, (derived by de-tiding the total elevation as 5 \ndescribed previously), presented in Figs. 4 and 5 that the response of the region to westerly 6 \nwind forcing, namely onshore winds in the eastern Irish Sea is an increase in elevation in this 7 \nregion.  A decrease in elevation occurs in the Celtic Sea (not shown), as wind forces water 8 \ninto the eastern Irish Sea.  The rise in sea level from west to east across the eastern Irish Sea, 9 \nrapidly increases as the water shallows.  This can be readily understood in terms of the wind 10 \nstress forcing term x\/(h + \u03b6) which for a uniform wind stress x, increases as the water 11 \nshallows.  The rapid rise in water level in the nearshore estuarine regions (namely Solway, 12 \nMorecambe Bay and Liverpool Bay (see Figs. 1, 2 for locations)) of the eastern Irish Sea is 13 \nclearly evident in Figs. 4 and 5 with water levels increasing, in shallow water to values 14 \nexceeding 0.3 m as the coast is approached.  In the nearshore region there is significant small 15 \nscale variability due to changes in topography and \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurring during the 16 \ntidal cycle.  Although the present finite element mesh is sufficiently fine to resolve the 17 \ndominant features of these small scale variations, in some very nearshore regions, a finer 18 \nmesh would be valuable.  However without accurate bathymetry data to match this refined 19 \nmesh, solution accuracy would still be limited. 20 \n To understand how the presence of the surge changes the tide due to non-linear 21 \ninteraction and enhanced bottom stress due to surge current (see later), it is necessary to 22 \ncompute changes in tidal amplitude \u0394A and phase \u0394g derived as the difference between tidal 23 \namplitude and phase from the harmonic analysis of a tide and surge solution, minus those 24 \nfrom the tidal solution.  Contours of \u0394A in cm, and \u0394g (not shown but comparable for the 25 \n 10 \nM2, M4 and M6 tidal constituent in the west wind case), in shallow coastal regions of the 1 \neastern Irish Sea illustrated here in terms of Morecambe Bay and Liverpool Bay are given in 2 \nFigs. 6 and 7.  It is evident from Fig. 6a that in the shallow northern part of Morecambe Bay, 3 \nthe effect of the wind from the west has been to increase the amplitude derived by harmonic 4 \nanalysis of tide and surge time series of the M2 tidal elevation by up to 30 cm.  From Fig. 5 it 5 \nis apparent that the storm surge increases water levels in this area by up to 40 cm, which will 6 \ntend to reduce tidal damping due to bottom friction.  This will be discussed later in the 7 \ncontext of time series of specific terms in the hydrodynamic equations at selected points.  In 8 \naddition some regions which were \u201cwet and dry\u201d during a tidal cycle will remain \u201cwet\u201d due 9 \nto the presence of the surge.  Although M2 tidal elevation amplitude increases in the north of 10 \nMorecambe Bay (namely north of 54  06\u2032, Fig. 6a), it is evident that in the nearshore region 11 \nto the south of this, there is a decrease in amplitude of up to -10 cm.  The reason for this is 12 \nnot entirely clear, (but is discussed later in terms of time series), although it does coincide 13 \nwith the area of maximum surge elevation of up to 50 cm (Fig. 5).  One possible explanation 14 \nis that since bed stress is given by huuk , then its reduction due to increase in (h + 15 \n\u03b6) may be negated by an increase in uu  due to strong surge currents in shallow water.  16 \nThis will give rise to significant spatial variability.  As shown in Figs. 6b and 6c any local 17 \nchanges in bed stress can lead to significant small scale changes in the difference in 18 \namplitude of both the M4 and M6 tidal elevations between those computed with tide and surge 19 \nand tide only, which increase\/decrease in some areas.  Since both of these constituents are 20 \ninfluenced by the regional extent of \u201cwetting and drying\u201d, changes in bed stress and 21 \nmomentum advection produced by the presence of surge elevations and currents, small scale 22 \nvariations may be expected (see later discussion).  It is important to note that Figs. 6a, 6b and 23 \n6c, are differences in amplitude of the M2, M4 and M6 tidal elevations due to the presence of 24 \nthe surge.  In the case of M6, the contour interval is 1 cm, and hence shows significant small 25 \n 11 \nscale variability, in the difference.  As discussed previously a refined mesh and more accurate 1 \nbottom topography would be required to improve the accuracy of the solution.  However, all 2 \nfigures do show that the tide has been appreciably influenced by the presence of the surge.  3 \nConsequently when a surge residual is determined by de-tiding using a tide only solution the 4 \ntrue tidal signal at the time of the surge is appreciably different and hence some tidal energy 5 \nwill remain in the surge derived by this method. 6 \n A similar picture to that found in Morecambe Bay occurs in the Liverpool Bay and 7 \nentrance to the Mersey region (Fig. 7a-c).  It is interesting that in the region at the entrance to 8 \nthe Mersey and just outside it, M2 tidal amplitude decreases by -10 cm, in the area of 9 \nmaximum surge amplitude (Fig. 4) in a similar manner to that found in Morecambe Bay.  10 \nElsewhere in the coastal region, the M2 tidal amplitude shows small scale decreases and 11 \nincreases.  As in Morecambe Bay the higher harmonics, namely M4 and M6 have appreciable 12 \nsmall scale variability in the region (Figs. 7b and 7c).  As in Morecambe Bay, the accuracy of 13 \nthese small changes in higher harmonics would be enhanced by a finer mesh and more 14 \ndetailed bottom topography.  To complete this study of the large scale effects of a westerly 15 \nwind upon the tide a detailed point comparison is given in Tables 2a-c at shallow water 16 \nlocations in the eastern Irish Sea shown in Fig. 2. 17 \n At positions such as Hilbre, Conwy and Barrow which are adjacent to regions of 18 \nshallow water it is difficult to determine which nodal point in the finite element grid is most 19 \nappropriate for the comparison.  Also there is no nodal point which is exactly located at 20 \nHilbre or Barrow.  For this reason and to determine tidal spatial variability in the region, the 21 \ntidal amplitude and phase at nodal points a distance \u0394 from the port are given in Tables 2a-c.  22 \nTo understand the influence of local water depth h, this is also presented.  At other locations 23 \nnamely Liverpool P.P, Liverpool Bay and SN35 situated in deeper water there is little or no 24 \n 12 \nvariability over distances of order 4 km from the gauge, and hence only the solution at the 1 \nnearest node is given. 2 \n From Figs. 6a and 7a and Table 2a, it is apparent that away from the near coastal 3 \nregion of the eastern Irish Sea the decrease in M2 tidal amplitude due to the presence of the 4 \nwest wind is of the order of 4 cm with phase changing by about 1  (e.g. SN35, h = 33.3 m, 5 \n\u0394A = 4 cm, \u0394g = 1 , Table 2a).  However, as water shallows in the Liverpool Bay region, 6 \nthere is a continuing decrease in amplitude due to the presence of west wind forcing (e.g. 7 \nLiverpool Bay, h = 11.2 m, \u0394A = 6 cm, Liverpool P.P, h = 8.2 m, \u0394A = 14 cm, Table 2a), 8 \nalthough there is little phase change.  In shallow water regions such as Hilbre water depth 9 \nchanges from 16.2 m to 2.0 m over distances of the order of a kilometre (Table 2a).  10 \nAssociated with these changes in water depth are variations in M2  tidal amplitude from 275 11 \ncm to 324 cm, although phase change is of the order of 1  (Table 2a).  The effect of forcing 12 \nwith a westerly wind is to increase water depth in this region.  Consequently in very shallow 13 \nregions, namely h = 2.0 and 2.3 m the increase in water depth reduces the effect of bottom 14 \nfriction and hence tidal amplitude increases from 275 cm to 291 m (h = 2.0 m) and 294 cm to 15 \n306 cm ( h = 2.3 m).  At deeper water locations namely h = 9.6 m and 16.2 m, as discussed 16 \npreviously for SN35 and Liverpool, the increase in bed stress due to stronger storm surge 17 \ncurrents, offsets its decrease due to an increase in water depth, and M2 tidal amplitudes 18 \ndecrease (319 cm to 309 cm, (h = 9.6 m), and 324 cm to 314 cm, h = 16.2).  However, as 19 \nfound at deeper water sites there is little phase change.  This comparison clearly shows why 20 \nat a port such as Hilbre where there is a substantial depth change over distances of order 1 21 \nkm, the change in the M2 tide due to the addition of a westerly wind stress shows such small 22 \nscale variability. 23 \n At a port such as Conwy which is surrounded by shallow water the addition of a 24 \nwesterly wind leads to an increase in M2 tidal amplitude at all locations in the vicinity of 25 \n 13 \nConwy (Table 2a).  As previously there is no substantial change in tidal phase.  At Barrow RI 1 \nand HP, again in shallow water the addition of a westerly wind tends to increase M2 tidal 2 \namplitude, although in a water depth of order 9 m there is no change.  This suggests that 3 \ndepending on the exact location of such points, the increase in bed stress due to the enhanced 4 \ncurrent of tidal origin is offset by its decrease due to change in total water depth. 5 \n This detailed examination explains why de-tiding using a tide only solution fails to 6 \nremove all tidal energy from the surge.  As shown here, in deep water this is not substantially 7 \ndifferent from that computed with the tide only and hence a linear decomposition into tide 8 \nand surge is valid, and a linear subtraction of the tide is possible.  However, in shallow 9 \nregions non-linear effects and enhancements in bottom stress due to the presence of storm 10 \nsurge currents, modify the tidal amplitude, leading to small scale increases and decreases in 11 \ntidal amplitude.  This explains the small scale variability in shallow water shown in the M2 12 \n\u0394A plots given in Figs. 6a and 7a.  In addition it is in part the reason for the small scale 13 \nvariations in near-shore surge elevation shown in Figs. 4 and 5. 14 \n Besides the west wind influencing the M2 component of the tide, it also affects the M4 15 \ncomponent as shown in the \u0394A distribution (Figs. 6b and 7b).  Although this component in 16 \noffshore regions is significantly smaller than the M2 tide, it is evident (Table 2b), that at 17 \nSN35, and Liverpool Bay there is a slight change with a reduction of over 6 cm at Liverpool 18 \nP.P (Table 2b).  Unlike the M2 tide an appreciable change occurs in the phase (Table 2b).  In 19 \nshallow regions such as Hilbre, not only does the M4 tide change over small distances, but 20 \nthere is a major change (of order 60 ) in its phase (Table 2b).  The addition of the west wind 21 \nappears (Table 2b) to increase amplitude and phase in deeper water (h = 9.6 and 16.2 m), 22 \nwith a decrease in shallow water (Table 2b).  This also occurs at Conwy which is situated in 23 \nshallow water where at all locations M4 amplitude and phase decrease with the addition of the 24 \nwesterly wind.  However, the response to westerly wind forcing is rather different at Barrow 25 \n 14 \nwhere in very shallow water denoted by h = 0.0 m in Table 2b, the M4 amplitude increases 1 \nwith little change in phase, whereas in deeper water there is little change in amplitude 2 \nalthough some in phase.  These results explain the small scale variation shown in Figs. 6b and 3 \n7b.  4 \n In deeper water regions, namely SN35 and Liverpool Bay the M6 tidal amplitude is of 5 \nthe order of 5 cm, or less (Table 2c).  In shallower water regions namely Liverpool P.P it 6 \nreaches the order of 15 cm, although it is not significantly affected by the west wind.  At 7 \nHilbre in deeper water (h = 9.6 and 16.2 m) there is a slight increase in amplitude with a 8 \ndecrease in phase.  In shallow water (h of order 2 m), the amplitude decreases by 50% with 9 \nan associated change in phase.  However at Conwy in comparable water depths the change is 10 \nmuch less and does not follow a consistent picture.  A consistent change depending on water 11 \ndepth between M6 tidal amplitude with and without a westerly wind was not evident at 12 \nBarrow RI or HP.  This high degree of spatial variability in the change in M6 tidal amplitude 13 \nin shallow water is clearly evident in Figs. 6c and 7c.   14 \n3.2 Effect of a northerly wind of 1.0 Pa upon the tide 15 \n In a subsequent calculation (Calc. 2, Table 1) the model was forced by a northerly 16 \nwind stress.  The steady-state surge residual (Figs. 8 and 9) showed a decrease (negative 17 \nsurge) over the majority of the region (Fig. 8).  A southerly wind, considered later, showed a 18 \npositive surge (Fig 10). For the northerly wind a negative surge of increasing magnitude 19 \noccurred in the Solway and Morecambe Bay as the northern edge of these regions was 20 \napproached, as a result of the local wind stress in these areas.  In the coastal region in 21 \nparticular in Morecambe and Liverpool Bays there is significant spatial variability in the 22 \nsurge elevation.  This in part arises from changes in topography but is also due to the 23 \ninfluence of the wind upon the tide as shown in the \u0394A contours (Figs. 11 and 12), and the 24 \nport values given in Tables 2a-c.  As discussed previously, the accuracy of the small scale 25 \n 15 \nvariability shown in Figs. 11 and 12, would be improved by more accurate bottom 1 \ntopography and a refined nearshore mesh. 2 \n It is evident from Figs. 11a and 12a and Table 2a, that at deep water locations (e.g. 3 \nSN35 and Liverpool Bay, Table 2a) the M2 tidal amplitude is reduced by 4 cm, by the 4 \npresence of the northerly wind.  This is comparable to that due to the westerly wind, 5 \nsuggesting that it is frictional effects due to the increase in currents rather than changes in 6 \nsurge elevation, which are different in the two cases, that are responsible for this.  This point 7 \nwill be considered later in connection with time series of various terms in the hydrodynamic 8 \nequations at specific points.  In shallower water, namely Liverpool P.P, although tidal 9 \namplitude decreases (see Fig. 12a and Table 2a), this decrease is not as large as for the west 10 \nwind case.  This will be examined later in terms of additional bed stress due to surge currents, 11 \nwhich has the effect of decreasing the tidal amplitude.  At Hilbre, in deeper water locations in 12 \nthe area, namely h = 9.6 m and 16.2 m the tidal amplitude decreases by about the same 13 \namount as in the west wind case (Table 2a).  In addition in shallow water h = 2 m and 2.3 m, 14 \na 10 cm decrease is also evident.  This shallow water response is different from the west wind 15 \ncase where M2 tidal amplitudes increased in shallow water, due to the presence of the wind.  16 \nDifferences in the spatial distribution of A contours are clearly evident from a comparison 17 \nof Figs. 7a and 12a.  Similar differences occur in Morecambe Bay (compare Figs. 6a and 18 \n11a).  In the west wind case the water level increased in the regions and hence the effect of 19 \nbed stress was reduced and tidal amplitude increased.  In the present case water depths 20 \ndecrease, hence bed stress increases and tidal amplitude decreases. 21 \n At Conwy, in shallow water, the tidal amplitude in the north wind case is reduced at 22 \nall locations (Table 2a).  Similarly at Barrow RI and HP, M2 tidal amplitude in shallow water 23 \nregions decreases with the addition of the northerly wind stress.  This is the opposite to that 24 \nfound with a westerly wind stress.  This detailed study explains why \u0394A for the M2 tide 25 \n 16 \n(Figs. 11a and 12a) varies significantly over short distances and in many regions has the 1 \nopposite sign to that found with a westerly wind stress. 2 \n As for the westerly wind case, \u0394A for the M4 tide computed with northerly wind 3 \nforcing shows significant spatial variability in the nearshore region (Figs. 11b and 12b).  In 4 \nMorecambe Bay the change in the M4 tide produced by the north wind (Fig. 11b) is 5 \nsignificantly larger than that produced by the west.  This is due to the fact that the north wind 6 \nleads to a reduction in water level and hence an increase in the shallow water terms that give 7 \nrise to the M4 and M6 tide (see later discussion in terms of time series).  In addition in areas 8 \nwhere \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occur, at times of low water when drying is present, the tidal 9 \nelevation time series is limited by the water depth and is no longer truly sinusoidal (see later 10 \ndiscussion).  A consequence of this is the harmonic analysis of such a time series contains 11 \nenergy in the higher harmonics due to the \u201cGibbs phenomenon\u201d associated with the period of 12 \ndrying (Hall and Davies 2005).  A more detailed discussion of this in terms of time series is 13 \ngiven later.  Similar differences between westerly and northerly wind effects upon the M4 tide 14 \nare found in the shallow water regions of Liverpool Bay (compare Figs. 7b and 12b).  From 15 \nTable 2b it is apparent that even at deeper water locations such as Liverpool Bay and 16 \nLiverpool P.P. the M4 tidal amplitude and phase increase by about 5 cm and 20  when a 17 \nnortherly wind is added.  A very similar increase occurs at the deeper water locations at 18 \nHilbre, with a substantially larger increase in amplitude but little change in phase in the 19 \nshallower locations around the Hilbre gauge.  An increase in elevation and phase, in deeper 20 \nregions (h = 9.1, 6.4, 5.9 m) occurs at Barrow, although in the shallow regions (h = 0.0 m) 21 \nthere is a small decrease in elevation amplitude with little change in phase.  This change in 22 \nM4 elevation amplitude at Barrow is the opposite of that found with the westerly wind.  In the 23 \nwesterly wind case water levels rose in the region.  Consequently in very shallow regions 24 \nbottom frictional effects were reduced leading to an increase in M4 tidal amplitude.  In the 25 \n 17 \npresent case they are reduced by the northerly wind.  The differences in \u0394A over the short 1 \ndistance between shallow and deeper water, explains the spatial variability seen in Figs. 11b 2 \nand 12b. 3 \n For the M6 component (Figs. 11c and 12c), there is a small increase in amplitude at 4 \nSN35 as for the west wind case, although a decrease in Liverpool Bay rather than the increase 5 \nfound with the west wind.  At Hilbre there is only a small change in amplitude and phase 6 \ncompared to the large change with the west wind.  As discussed previously the west wind in 7 \nthis region increases water levels thereby reducing bottom stress which is a major source of 8 \nM6 (see later discussion in terms of time series).  In the present case there is a reduction in 9 \nwater level (Fig. 8), although this is small 0.2 m, in Liverpool Bay which explains the small 10 \nchange in M6 with the north wind in this region  However, it is larger further north with 11 \nvalues of the order 0.5 m in Morecambe Bay (Fig. 9).  This reduction in water level explains 12 \nthe significant change in M6 tidal amplitude in this region (Fig. 11c). 13 \n At Barrow RI and HP there is a general reduction in water level of 0.5 m, with 14 \nsignificant local variation giving a decrease of 0.8 m in some areas.  In the very shallow 15 \nwater regions (h = 0.0 m) there is a significant increase in M6 tidal amplitude from the order 16 \nof 5 cm to 18 cm (Table 2c).  This is probably due to an increase in bottom friction and 17 \ndrying during the tidal cycle which has the effect of increasing the M6 tide (see later 18 \ndiscussion).  This change in \u0394A (M6) is very different from the west wind case, which raised 19 \nwater levels in this region producing a slight reduction in M6.  The substantial difference in 20 \nA values for the M6 tide both in amplitude and spatial distribution in Morecambe Bay 21 \nbetween the westerly and northerly winds is clearly evident from a comparison of Figs. 6c 22 \nand 12c.  Similar differences although to a lesser extent are evident in the coastal regions of 23 \nLiverpool Bay (Figs. 7c and 12c).  This clearly shows that A values change from one 24 \nlocation to another over quite small distances and depend upon wind stress direction. 25 \n 18 \n3.3 Effect of  a southerly wind of 1.0 Pa upon the tide 1 \n To examine to what extent wind direction influenced the solution, the previous 2 \ncalculation was repeated with the same wind stress from the south (Calc 3, Table 1).  By this 3 \nmeans the extent to which the response can be linearly scaled with the wind field can be 4 \ndetermined.  If the response is truly linear then the surge elevation determined with a 5 \nsoutherly wind (Fig. 10) should be the negative of the northerly wind solution.  Similarly 6 \nthere should be a corresponding change in the distribution of \u0394A. 7 \n The large scale features and magnitude of the surge elevation in deep water (not 8 \nshown) were comparable to those found with the northerly wind stress, with elevations, 9 \nhaving the opposite sign.  Similarly, in shallow water regions such as the eastern Irish Sea 10 \n(compare Fig. 10 and Fig. 8) away from shallow coast regions the distributions had the same 11 \nfeatures, with elevations of the opposite sign.  This suggests that when the surge is de-tided 12 \nusing tidal harmonics computed at the time of the surge, the resulting surge scales in a linear 13 \nmanner with the imposed wind stress.  However as before the surge changes the tide in 14 \nshallow water regions as shown in Figs. 13 and Fig. 14, and in Table 2.  However these 15 \nchanges in the tide have a different spatial distribution and amplitude from those computed 16 \nwith a northerly wind stress (compare Figs. 13, 14 and 11, 12).  For the M2 tide at location 17 \nSN35 in deeper water it is apparent that the southerly wind decreases M2 tidal amplitude 18 \nmore than the northerly.  This is probably due to frictional effects arising from larger surge 19 \ncurrents produced by southerly more than northerly winds (see later discussion). 20 \n However in Liverpool Bay both wind stresses give the same reduction, whereas at 21 \nLiverpool P.P. the northerly wind reduces the M2 tidal amplitude more than the southerly 22 \n(Table 2a).  These changes in M2 tidal amplitude with the addition of winds from different 23 \ndirections, reflect changes in the M2 co-amplitude lines in the region, due to modification of 24 \nwater depth and bottom friction over the whole region produced by the surge. 25 \n 19 \n In shallow water regions such as Hilbre and Conwy the southerly wind produces a 1 \nsmall change in sea level (Fig. 10) with an associated small change in M2 tidal amplitude 2 \n(Table 2a).  At Barrow RI and HP, the southerly wind gives rise to a local increase in water 3 \nlevel (Fig. 10).  In very shallow water h = 0.0 m, this gives rise to an increase in M2 tidal 4 \namplitude by about 30 cm.  In these regions the increase in bed stress due to enhanced wind 5 \nforced current is offset by its reduction due to increase in water depth.  However, in deeper 6 \nwater h = 9.1, 6.4, 3.3 m, elevations are reduced due to the enhanced flow.  Although the 7 \nchange \u0394A in M2 tidal amplitude due to the north wind has on average the opposite sign to 8 \nthe south wind case, it is evident from Table 2a, and differences in the spatial distributions 9 \ngiven in Figs. 12a and 14a, that there are significant differences in the magnitude of these 10 \nchanges and their spatial variability. 11 \n From Table 2b, it is apparent that at Liverpool Bay and Liverpool P.P. the M4 tidal 12 \namplitude decreases by 4 cm due to the presence of the south wind.  This is comparable to the 13 \norder of 5 cm increase due to the North wind.  At Hilbre in deeper water h = 9.6 and 16.2 m, 14 \nthe M4 amplitude decreases by about 4 cm, with a significantly larger decrease of about 8 cm 15 \nin shallow water.  Although this is in the opposite sense to that found for the north wind, the 16 \nmagnitude of the change is slightly different, namely about 6 cm in both shallow and deep.  17 \nAlthough these magnitudes are different, the fact that the change in M4 is in the opposite 18 \ndirection and of comparable magnitude for each wind direction suggests some linearity in its 19 \nresponse.  Similarly at Conwy in shallow water the south wind produces a change of M4 tidal 20 \namplitude of comparable magnitude to the north wind but in the opposite sense. 21 \n In deeper water at Barrow RI and HP, a decrease in M4 amplitude with the southerly 22 \nwind, with an increase due to the northerly wind is evident.  However, in shallow water h = 23 \n0.0, a decrease is evident for both wind directions.  This suggests that for M4 there is some 24 \ndegree of linearity in the change \u0394A for different wind directions provided the water is not 25 \n 20 \ntoo shallow.  However in very shallow regions such as Morecambe Bay, it is evident that the 1 \ndistribution of A contours of the M4 tide computed with the south wind (Fig. 13b) is 2 \nsubstantially different from that computed with the north wind (Fig. 11b).  Although in the 3 \nsouthwind case there is a reduction in M4 amplitude, with on average an increase in the north 4 \nwind case due to decrease in water depth, these do not scale with the wind stress magnitude.  5 \nSimilar differences in A distributions and values are found in nearshore regions in 6 \nLiverpool Bay (compare Figs. 14b and 12b). 7 \n For the M6 tide there is on average, particularly in shallow water, (see Conwy, Barrow 8 \netc) an increase in amplitude when southerly wind forcing is included.  This is consistent with 9 \nthat found for the north wind although at Barrow the change in \u0394A for M6 due to the south 10 \nwind is less than the north wind.  The small scale variability of the change in \u0394A for the two 11 \ndifferent wind directions is reflected in Figs. 11c, 12c and 13c, 14c. 12 \n This series of calculations clearly shows that in shallow water the tidal constituents 13 \nare affected by the presence of the wind stress, due to the importance of non-linear effects in 14 \nthese regions.  To quantify the extent and regional variation of the linearity of the surge 15 \nderived by de-tiding using tidal harmonics derived from analysing the tide and surge solution 16 \nit is valuable to consider the difference between the surge due to the northerly wind and that 17 \ndetermined by scaling the southerly wind solution by -1.0.  If the response is linear these two 18 \nsolutions should be identical and their difference zero.  19 \n A plot over the whole model domain (not shown) revealed that this was the case 20 \nexcept in the nearshore region, particularly in the eastern Irish Sea.  In this area the regions 21 \nwhere there was most difference between the two solutions was in the Solway Firth, 22 \nMorecambe Bay and Liverpool Bay, although on average the difference was below 5 cm.  23 \nThis suggests that the surge residual derived by this method, can be readily scaled to give a 24 \nresidual for an arbitrary steady wind field.  In this de-tiding approach, the non-linear 25 \n 21 \ninteraction mainly appears as a change in the tide and hence the tidal constituents rather than 1 \nthe surge. 2 \n4. EFFECT OF THE SURGE UPON COMPUTED TIDAL CURRENTS 3 \n In this section we examine changes in tidal currents in shallow water due to tide-surge 4 \ninteraction for a number of wind directions.  This complements the study as to how tide surge 5 \ninteraction modified the amplitude and phase of the M2, M4 and M6 elevations, by examining 6 \nto what extent tidal ellipses are modified by the surge.  Considering initially the west wind 7 \ncase, distributions of the difference in tidal current ellipse (determined from the difference in 8 \ntidal current analysis at the M2, M4 and M6 frequencies, without and with the surge) over the 9 \nwhole region between a tide only solution and that with tide and the westerly wind (not 10 \npresented) showed that changes were mainly confined to near coastal regions, in particular to 11 \nthe eastern Irish Sea (Figs. 15-19). 12 \n It is evident from Fig. 15, and expanded plots of Morecambe Bay and Liverpool Bay 13 \n(Figs. 18a and 19a), that although the M2 tidal currents are not significantly influenced by the 14 \nsurge in offshore regions there are appreciable changes in shallow water areas.  This is 15 \nconsistent with the changes found in M2 tidal elevation amplitude.  In Morecambe Bay it is 16 \nclear (Fig. 18a) that there is significant spatial variability in the M2 tidal ellipse difference 17 \nwhich is largest in the shallow northern part of the estuary and smallest in the deep south 18 \nwest corner.  Similarly in the Liverpool Bay region (Fig. 19a) the largest changes occur in the 19 \nMersey and Dee estuaries. 20 \n The spatial distribution of the change in M4 tidal current ellipse (Fig. 16) over the 21 \neastern Irish Sea is comparable to that found for the M2 tide.  This is to be expected since this 22 \ncomponent is generated from the M2 tide by non-linear interaction.  However, its magnitude 23 \nis smaller, reflecting the smaller M4 tidal currents compared to the M2.  As for the M2 tide the 24 \nchange is largest in the northern part of the bay, and negligible in deep water.  In the deeper 25 \n 22 \nwater regions of Liverpool Bay (Fig. 19b) there is no appreciable change in the M4 tidal 1 \ncurrents, although they are significantly modified in the estuarine regions. 2 \n The M6 tidal currents which are negligible away from shallow water regions (Jones 3 \nand Davies 2007b) are essentially unaffected by the surge, except in near coastal regions (Fig. 4 \n17) where bottom friction is important and \u201cwetting and drying\u201d can occur.  Although the 5 \nchange in M6 currents is small compared to M4, it is significant in the shallow northern region 6 \nof Morecambe Bay (Fig. 18c) and in the Dee and Mersey estuary area (Fig. 19c). 7 \n Although the detailed patterns and values of the change in tidal current ellipses due to 8 \nthe other wind fields (not presented) are slightly different to those found in the west wind 9 \ncase, the general conclusion that tidal currents are mainly affected by storm surge currents in 10 \nshallow water remains the same.  This suggests that as the nearshore grid is refined in a finite 11 \nelement model to improve near coastal resolution and hence the computed surge, tidal 12 \ncurrents will be increasingly modified by the presence of the surge. 13 \n5. SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN TIME SERIES OF TERMS GIVING RISE TO TIDE- 14 \nSURGE INTERACTION  15 \n 16 \nIn the previous sections the spatial variability of the change in tidal elevation 17 \namplitude and current ellipse distributions at the M2 tidal frequency and its higher harmonics, 18 \ndue to the presence of the wind was examined.  This change in tidal amplitude is in part 19 \nproduced by an increase\/decrease in water depth, particularly in shallow water where drying 20 \ncan occur.  In addition changes in the non-linear bottom friction terms ku(u\n2\n + v\n2\n)\n1\/2\/(h + \u03b6) 21 \nand kv(u\n2\n + v\n2\n)\n1\/2\/(h + \u03b6), and non-linear momentum advection terms udu\/dx, vdu\/dy, udv\/dx 22 \nand vdv\/dy which in shallow water couple together tidal and surge currents, namely tide-23 \nsurge interaction also influence the distribution of energy between tidal constituents and the 24 \nsurge.  In this section by examining time series of these various terms their importance in 25 \ndeep and shallow locations, and their influence on tide-surge interaction can be appreciated.  26 \nTo this end time series over cycles 7 and 8 (the final two tidal cycles) at locations A in deep 27 \n 23 \nwater (Fig. 2), and B in the shallow water region of Morecambe Bay (Fig. 2), are examined in 1 \ndetail for the cases of the southerly wind, leading to an increase in water level, and northerly 2 \nwind leading to a decrease in water level. 3 \nConsidering initially the elevation time series at position (A) due to the tide only and 4 \ntide and surge, it is evident from Fig. 20, that in the absence of wind forcing, tidal elevation 5 \nhas a mean value of zero, with an amplitude of about 2.7 m, and energy is confined to the M2 6 \nperiod.  These values were confirmed by a harmonic analysis of the time series.  In the case 7 \nof a southerly or northerly wind, mean sea level, increased\/decreased by about 0.2 m, with 8 \nthe tide remaining unchanged.  Time series of the non-linear friction and advective terms at 9 \nthis location (not presented) showed that they were small and their change, taken as the 10 \ndifference between tide and surge and tide only, namely Fig. 21 (frictional effects) and Fig. 11 \n22 (advective terms) revealed only small changes depending upon the direction of wind 12 \nforced currents compared to tidal currents, and in addition the small change in water depth in 13 \nthe bottom friction case.  In essence in deep water the steady state balance was between wind 14 \nstress and sea surface elevation gradients with the non-linear terms playing little or no role.  15 \nConsequently the M2 tide dominated the solution, with total elevations and currents 16 \ndetermined as a linear combination of those due to tidal and wind forcing.  In essence non-17 \nlinear coupling due to tide-surge interaction was negligible. 18 \nIn shallow water (Position B, Fig. 2) due to \u201cwetting and drying\u201d the tidal elevation 19 \ncurve (Fig. 23) shows significant asymmetry.  Although the maximum elevation exceeds 3 m, 20 \nits minimum value cannot fall below -1.8 m, as this is the water depth in the region, and 21 \ndrying occurs as shown in the time series (Fig. 23).  As demonstrated by Hall and Davies 22 \n(2005) when such an asymmetric time series is harmonically analysed besides energy 23 \noccurring at the M2 period, it is also present at its higher harmonics. 24 \n 24 \nIn the case of a southerly or northerly wind stress the water depth increases\/decreases 1 \nin the region thereby changing the asymmetry in the tidal curve (Fig. 23) and hence 2 \ninfluencing the amplitude of the M2 tide and its higher harmonics.  Besides the change in sea 3 \nlevel produced by the wind, it also influences the time series of the quadratic bottom friction 4 \nand momentum advection terms (not shown) which are significant in this region.  Comparing 5 \ntime series of the difference in these terms derived as previously, namely Figs. 24 (frictional 6 \neffects) and Fig. 25 (advection terms) shows that they are significantly larger of order 100 to 7 \n1000 in the friction terms (compare Figs. 21 and 24) and of order 10 to 100 depending upon 8 \nlocation in the momentum advection terms (compare Figs. 22 and 25). 9 \nIt is evident from the time series of the quadratic friction and momentum advection 10 \nterms, and confirmed by harmonic analysis, that there is significant energy at frequencies 11 \ncorresponding to the fundamental and higher harmonics of the tide in these time series.  12 \nConsequently changes in these non-linear terms produced by the addition of wind forcing 13 \nwill influence at Posn B both the fundamental and higher harmonics of the tide through tide-14 \nsurge interaction.  As shown here, the extent of this interaction depends on water depth, and 15 \nclearly increases as water depth is reduced, and tidal and wind forced currents increase.  16 \nDepending upon the relative magnitude of tidal currents and their orientation and phase 17 \nrelative to the local wind forced current, the temporal and spatial variability of both the 18 \nfrictional and advective terms changes significantly.  These changes in frictional and 19 \nadvective terms together with \u201cwetting and drying\u201d explains the high spatial variability in the 20 \nM2, M4 and M6 components of tidal elevation and current produced by wind forcing. 21 \n6. CONCLUSIONS 22 \n In a previous paper Jones and Davies (2007a) examined the extent to which tide-surge 23 \ninteraction modified the computed surge due to uniform constant wind stresses over the west 24 \ncoast of Britain.  Here that work is extended to consider how the tide is modified by the 25 \n 25 \nsurge.  As previously a finite element west coast model is used in these calculations.  The 1 \nfinite element mesh in the west coast model is such that a high resolution is obtained in the 2 \neastern Irish Sea.  By this means it is possible to examine the non-linear interaction between 3 \ntidal and wind forced motion in shallow nearshore regions.  Initial calculations were 4 \nperformed with uniform steady westerly and northerly wind stresses of 1.0 Pa.  By using 5 \northogonal winds, if the wind forced response of the region was linear then the response to a 6 \nuniform wind stress of arbitrary magnitude and direction could be determined by scaling and 7 \nadding these solutions.  A southerly wind stress was also considered to examine if the tide is 8 \nmodified in a linear manner by the presence of the surge.   9 \n Calculations and analysis of time series of surface elevation and the non-linear terms 10 \nin deep and shallow regions clearly showed that in shallow water coastal regions there are 11 \nsignificant non-linear effects which influence both the computed tidal elevation amplitude 12 \nand tidal current distributions.  A detailed examination of the tide showed that the extent to 13 \nwhich the tide is changed by the presence of the surge depends upon location, in particular 14 \nwater depth, and wind direction.  In shallow water the change in the tide was found to be 15 \nappreciable and was produced by changes in \u201cwetting and drying\u201d, non-linear bottom 16 \nfriction, and the momentum advection terms due to the presence of the wind.  Changes in 17 \nthese terms showed significant temporal and spatial variability depending upon water depth, 18 \nand alignment of tidal and wind forced currents.  Consequently the tide showed appreciable 19 \nsmall scale variability in its change produced by wind forcing.  The effect of the change in 20 \ntidal magnitude produced by the wind is that de-tiding a tide and surge calculation using tidal 21 \nconstituents from a tide only solution would lead to energy in the surge in shallow near 22 \ncoastal regions, at tidal frequencies.  Such an artificial leakage of energy is found when 23 \nobserved surge elevations are de-tided using a harmonically predicted tide, confirming that 24 \nthe surge does influence the tidal signal.  The artificial leakage gives rise to semi-diurnal 25 \n 26 \noscillations in the surge.  These have been observed not only in regions such as the Irish Sea 1 \nbut elsewhere (e.g. North Sea Horsburgh and Wilson (2007) and north-west Atlantic, e.g. 2 \nBernier and Thompson (2006)), although a detailed study using a numerical model of the 3 \nform used here has not previously been undertaken. 4 \n In the present calculation since only M2 tidal forcing and a steady wind stress was 5 \nimposed the influence of the surge upon the M2 tide and its harmonics could be determined 6 \nby harmonically analysing a short duration (namely a M2 period) time series.  Although this 7 \ngave significant insight into the effects of the surge upon the various tidal constituents it is 8 \ndifficult to extend to a time varying wind of surge period and larger number of constituents 9 \n(e.g. M2, S2, N2, K1, O1 Jones and Davies 1998).  The major difficulty in this case is that the 10 \nstorm surge only has a short duration of order 2 days.  As shown by Hall and Davies (2005) 11 \nseparation of the M2 and S2 tide from each other is possible using short periods (of order a 12 \nfew days) output from tide only numerical model runs, due to the absence of noise in model 13 \ncalculations.  However, in a storm surge model where meteorological effects are present an 14 \naccurate separation would be difficult to achieve.  Consequently de-tiding the tide and surge 15 \ncalculation using harmonic analysis to determine tidal constituents at the time of the surge 16 \nwould be prone to error in a storm surge simulation model.   Also the method of predicting 17 \ntotal water levels produced by a surge, namely by adding tidally predicted elevations (based 18 \non the harmonic analysis of a long time series at a port) to a surge elevation computed by a 19 \nnumerical model is also prone to error particularly in shallow regions.  Consequently in 20 \nfuture high resolution nearshore models it will be necessary to use the model to predict the 21 \ntotal water level during the surge period.  In this case it will be necessary for the model to 22 \naccurately reproduce the tide in shallow water.  However, as model grids in nearshore regions 23 \nare refined the ability of the model to reproduce tides in these regions is enhanced provided 24 \naccurate bathymetry is available to match the reduction in mesh size.    25 \n 27 \n Although extensive coastal and offshore tidal data sets exists to validate the accuracy 1 \nof tidal simulations (e.g. Jones and Davies 2005, 2007b), no comparable tidal data sets exist 2 \nat the time of major surge events to see to what extent the tide has been modified by the 3 \nsurge.  If however extensive offshore tide gauge measurements could be made in a region 4 \nsuch as Morecambe Bay for a significant number of surge events, and analysed by grouping 5 \ntogether surge events occurring under similar wind directions (e.g. westerly, northerly, 6 \nsoutherly) some indication of how the tide is modified by the surge and its spatial variability 7 \ncould be obtained.  Until such measurements are available for model validation, the most 8 \ncompelling evidence that the surge influences the tide is the presence of significant tidal 9 \nenergy in the surge record when it is derived by de-tiding using a tide derived from a long 10 \nterm record which does not take account of this interaction. 11 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 12 \nThe origin of the TELEMAC system is EDF-LNHE and is therefore \u00a9 EDF-LNHE.
