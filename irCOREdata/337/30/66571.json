The paper uses such conceptual discussions to consider more fully the multiple, \nsubtle and interdependent spatio-temporalities which together work to constitute ICT-based urban \nchange. While innovative work has traced the emergence of various online spaces and communities, \nour interest here is on the intersection of online and offline practices. Through a case study of two \ncontrasting neighbourhoods in Newcastle upon Tyne, the paper explores in detail how social \nrelations and grocery shopping are being affected by ICT use.  It suggests that the remediation of \neveryday urban life through ICTs involves subtle shifts in the spatial, temporal, scalar and material \nprocesses which together help constitute urban change, and which are all too often overlooked in \nconventional and binary approaches opposing the  \u201evirtual\u201f  realm of new technologies to \u201ereal\u201f \nurban places. \n \nIntroduction: \u2018Beyond the Real-Virtual Binary\u2019 \n \nMany of the most influential and seminal commentaries praising or criticising the likely impacts of  \nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICTs) on urban space work by opposing \u201evirtual\u201f \nspaces and mediated activities to \u201ereal\u201f places. By invoking such a binary, the ways in which the \nreal-time and instantaneous interactions and transactions which constitute the virtual world effect \nthe corporeal, physical domains of neighbourhoods and cities becomes the central object of theory, \nanalysis, and speculation. The conceptual architectures of urban ICT literatures thus work to invoke \nan urban world constituted by two distinct and apparently antagonistic domains. One, filled with \n3 \ninstantaneous and real-time flows, transglobal interactions and collapsed distinctions between \nspatial scales, works to undermine and rework the pre-existing urban world of corporeal interaction, \nphysical movement, and the traditional social constitution of the urban worlds of the street and \nneighbourhood. The language of these binaried world views permeated the key writings of the late \nnineties that first addressed the emerging significance of the Internet, new media and drew attention \nto possible impacts on urban life. We read, for example, of cyberspace versus \u201ereal\u201f space (Slouka \n1995), \u201ereal time\u201f eviscerating \u201ereal space\u201f (Virilio 1997; 1998), \u201evirtual\u201f cities and \u201ereal\u201f cities \n(Robins 1999; Nunes 2001), the \u201espace of flows\u201f superimposed upon the \u201espace of places\u201f (Castells \n2002), and the \u201ecity of bits\u201f challenging the material city (Mitchell 1995). Virilio posits the onset of \na \u201etyranny of real time [where] the city of the past slowly becomes a paradoxical agglomeration in \nwhich relations of immediate proximity give way to interrelationships over distance\u201f (Virilio, 1993: \n10). The effect of the separation is not to suggest that the \u201evirtual\u201f has no \u201eimpact\u201f but to set up the \nargument as just that \u2013 the scale of impact when these two distinct realms collide. An all-powerful \nvirtual domain was thus widely portrayed as bringing with it an absolute spatio-temporal shift \nwhich, quite literally, \u201eunglues\u201f previous notions of embodied urban life.  \n \nThese real-virtual binaries compounded a range of familiar, even habitual divides in thinking \nbetween abstract space and lived place. Here, place \u201cis always slower, more earthy, more concrete, \nmore grounded, and more real than space.\u201d Space, meanwhile, \u201clends itself to speed, immateriality, \nabstractness, flotation, and relational disjointure\u201d (Doel, 1999: 8). Such a deeply binaried \nconceptual architecture of urban-ICT relationships thus suggests a derealisation of the city and its \nreplacement with \u201esemantically empty\u201f and generic places (Wakabayashi 2002). Such portrayals \nrelate to a scalar imaginary where the possibilities mediated communication offers for distanciated \ninteraction come to be seen as implying a divide, even a conflict, between local (lived) and global \n(somehow not lived). Echoing Relph\u201fs terms, one might argue that \u201ethe Internet is distinctively \nplaceless. It is artificial, arbitrary, and seemingly \u201eno-place\u201f\u201f whereas we wish to show how \n4 \n\u201ecyberspace is not a separate \u201cother\u201d placeless geography distinct from the authentic physical world. \nIt is part of the place we find for ourselves in the world\u201f (Crampton 2003, page 83).  \n \nIt is clear, however, that ICTs have penetrated \u201ethe everyday lives of British [and other] people in a \nmanner that exhibited neither the futuristic melodrama predicted by the techno-evangelists nor the \nsocial fragmentation predicted by the nostalgic Luddites\u201f (Davies 2003, page 6). Moreover, as ICTs \nhave diffused widely to quickly become key parts of the ordinary, taken for granted technostructural \nbackground for widening domains of everyday life, conceptual binaries separating out ICT-\nmediated and non ICT-mediated interactions seem more and more anachronistic (Woolgar, 2002, \nAmin and Thrift, 2002). Our conceptual starting point in this paper, then, is not to see the \ninformational landscape as a technological given \u201eout there\u201f \u2013 as a complete and constructed \ndomain. Rather, we see it as actively constituted and reproduced through the lived realities of daily \npractice. Similarly, we also want to resist the notion that daily life is, or ever was, autonomous and \nnot already massively and complexly reliant on a range of technologies and informational practices \nwhich co-evolve with newer generations of ICTs.  \n \nIn this paper, we seek to find a nuanced way of thinking through the interactions of mediated and \nphysical action, as on and offline interactions are constituted and constructed together to sustain and \ntransform the complex temporalities and spatialities of everyday urban life. Our perspective does \nnot deny that ICT-mediated interactions can substitute for offline ones. Clearly, the emergence of \nreal time and telepresent action, mediated by ICTs, which substitutes for the traditional, corporeal \ninteractions of people within and through urban places, does constitute an important part of the \nprocess of ICT-based urban change. However, assuming such substitutionist dynamics cover all \npossibilities, and explain all dynamics in all cities, is a spectacularly one-dimensional reading of the \ncomplex spatio-temporalities of mediated interaction.  \n \n5 \nDrawing on a relational perspective of the intertwining of technology and everyday life, this paper \nhas two aims. First, we want to draw on recent theorising in media studies to help move beyond \nunhelpful real-virtual conceptual binaries. Second, and in parallel, we want to use such conceptual \ndiscussions to consider more fully the multiple, subtle and interdependent spatio- temporalities \nwhich together work to constitute ICT-based urban change. We therefore seek in what follows to \nthink through how ICTs affect the speed and duration of urban practices, making some faster, some, \npossibly, slower. But we also want to explore how ICT-mediated practices affect the fine-grained \nfrequency, synchronisation and sequencing of activities in urban timespace, and then the lags, \ndesired or otherwise, between action and effects, and thus the flexibility and\/or fixity of practices in \npeople\u201fs everyday urban schedules. In all of these temporal aspects of mediated practice, the paper \nremains conscious of the cascading effects of ICT-based interactions in one medium into other \nmediums and into non-mediated urban practice. Such a perspective raises particular questions for \ndebates about ICTs, urban exclusion, and  urban \u201edigital divides\u201f. For example, does accelerated \nmediated access for one group, result in slower physical access for another? What happens when \nmediated practices become normalised - both in the sense of being the expected norm, but also in \nthe sense of becoming habituated and embedded in routines? \n \nThis paper thus explores the multiple and linked spatial and temporal imbrications of ICTs in cities. \nIt argues that we need to see ICT-based urban dynamics as dynamic and ongoing processes. ICT-\nmediated urbanity is thus a verb not a noun. We thus want to consider place and \u201ecommunity\u201f in the \ninformational city as an ongoing social achievement (Slack and Williams 2000, page 314). Such a \nperspective usefully \u201eswitches the emphasis of urbanity from physical built form to the quality of \ninteraction in cultural life through the exchange of information\u201f (Little 2000, page 1814). The \ninformational landscape is thus not a given, but is an ongoing achievement; it is not axiomatic, but \nperformative (Doel and Hubbard 2002, page 355). Taking our cue from the tradition of time-\ngeography we want to examine the time-space orchestration of the city to unpack the effects of new \n6 \nmedia on urban life. This approach, we suggest, offers the chance to use a language of action and \nconstraint, possibility and performance to examine the intricate geographies of everyday life in the \ninformational city. \n \nThe paper is structured in two parts. In part one, we draw inspiration from media theorists Bolter \nand Grusin\u201fs (2000) concept of \u201eremediation\u201f, to highlight an alternative strand of work on ICT-\nbased urban change which, usefully, are not premised on a priori conceptual architectures opposing \nthe \u201evirtual\u201f and the \u201ereal\u201f. Through such work, we show that the dissolving and disembedding of \nurban activities through ICTs is not even half the story. In part two we move on to utilise case study \nevidence from an analysis of Newcastle upon Tyne to look in particular at the relocation and \nreembedding of activities in new configurations and the creations of new spatialities, concentrations \nand barriers within the everyday lives of urban neighbourhoods. We do this by looking at two sets \nof practices in which ICTs are becoming heavily involved: social networks and organising \nhousehold logistics. We choose the former since the fear of a loss of face-to-face interaction \nthrough ICT \u2013mediation use is a recurring theme in the literature. We address the latter since the \nability to overcome the friction of distance and orchestrate provisions and interactions without co-\npresence is another area that the literature highlights. This evidence demonstrates that new \ninformational practices not only help transform the geography of the city, but also depend upon \nthose new geographies. Nor is this a case of new media replacing old, virtual replacing actual or \ninformation replacing physical. Rather, we demonstrate that ICT-based urban change involves a \nlayering, tangling and imbrication of new practices and new possibilities alongside old ways and \nenduring demands. In our conclusion we emphasise, in particular, new constraints against old \npossibilities in the interaction of information and urban environment, digital terrain and physical \nfabric. \n \nThe \u2018Remediation\u2019 Of Urban Life \n7 \n \nWhen we look at contemporary interlacing of multiple media, flows and interactions we would \ncontend that \u201ethe emerging trend is not one of pure dispersal, but a multi-scalar co-mingling of \nelectronic and physical space\u201f (Page and Phillips 2003, page 73). Daily lives do not encounter a \ngreat divide of offline and online worlds ; rather, one feeds into the other in subtle, complex and \ncontinuous interplay (Woolgar, 2002). Thus: \n\u201eThe real-actual and the virtual-imaginary are not distinct halves but something akin to \noscillating forces in a shifting field, existing not side by side but through and across \neach other. If we were to assign identities to the real-actual and the virtual-imaginary, \nwe might say that they are at one singular and doubled, like Siamese twins. If they are \nentities at all, they share functions and spaces over coterminous territories, or \noverlapping regions of non-exclusivity. In our cities, there already exist \ndemonstrations of the links between the real and the virtual: the ubiquitous cash \nmachine (ATM), for example, the garish video arcade, even the lowly phone booth all \ncall into play the possibility of a coterminous merging of very real city of bricks and a \nconceptually experienced \u201ecity of bits\u201f.\u201f (Zellner 1999, page 10) \n \nElectronic media have a material presence in the city. While \u201evirtual spaces\u201f are in no way \ncoterminous with their supportive technical infrastructure,  they do have a physical infrastructure \nthat is all too often overlooked since \u201cnew telecommunications networks tend to be largely invisible \nand silent or, at most, relatively hard to discern\u201d often being buried or ethereal (Graham 1997, page \n109). There is a macro- geography where some cities are more connected than others and the \nimportance of such locations may be increasing (for examples see Castells 1989; 1996; Louch, \nHargittai et al. 1999; Moss and Townsend 2000; Zook 2002). More importantly here for our focus \non daily life, what is happening is not the substitution of the city by electronic space but, rather, the \npermeation of the urban milieu to the extent that the \u201emodern city exists as a haze of software \n8 \ninstructions\u201f (Amin and Thrift 2002, page 125). These pervasive software technologies often go \nunnoticed because they facilitate physical processes and interactions through an increasingly taken \nfor granted \u201ebackground\u201f (Thrift and French 2003, pages 311-12; Galloway 2004). New networks \nadapt old infrastructures where, \u201elike parasites taking over their hosts, they have transformed the \nfunctioning of the systems on which they were superimposed, redistributed activities within those \nsystems and eventually extended them in unprecedented ways\u201f(Mitchell 1999, page 15). Thus, there \nis a positive correlation of cellphone and wireless mast location and road network traffic (Bertaut \n2000). Meanwhile, there are multiple relationships of ICTs to travel beyond substitution. ICTs also \nenable the organisation of meetings and the maintenance social networks that involve physical \nmovement. Their use follows up physical meetings, and enable goods to be sourced from distant \nplaces further from us. And ICT use may save time that is then used to travel for other purposes (for \ncontrasting empirical outcomes of such interdependencies see Richardson and Gillespie (2000) and \nSchallab\u00f6ck, Utzmann et al. (2003) ).  \n \nRather than seeing either material practices \u201egrounding\u201f the ethereal or virtual spaces transcending \nthe urban, we thus see the urban tissue as articulating \u201eheterogeneous elements \u2026 without \nhomogenisation\u201f, as opposed to thinking through \u201ehierarchies\u201f which \u201ecreate structures out of \nelements sorted out into homogenous ranks\u201f (de Landa 1996, page 188). Such a perspective leads to \nthree central theoretical points. \n \nA Mingling and Layering of Interdependent Technologies \n \nFirst, informational cities comprise a mingling or a layering of technologies in interdependent \npatterns. This is a process that the media theorists Bolter and Grusin call remediation. Here new, \nICT-based media are seen to be piled atop other, pre-existing media and domains of urban and \n9 \nsocial interaction, but without the loss of, or substitution for, some authentic and \u201enon virtual\u201f pre-\ninformational reality.  Usefully for our purposes, Bolter and Grusin: \n\u201edo not believe that cyberspace is an immaterial world, but that it is very much a part of our \ncontemporary world and that it is constituted through a series of remediations. As a digital \nnetwork, cyberspace remediates the electric communications networks of the past 150 \nyears, the telegraph and the telephone; as virtual reality, it remediates the visual space of \nthe painting, film and television; and as social space, it remediates such historical places as \ncities and parks and such nonplaces as themeparks and shopping malls. Like other \ncontemporary mediated spaces, cyberspace refashions and extends earlier media, which are \nthemselves embedded in material and social environments\u201f (Bolter and Grusin 1999, pages \n182-3) \n \nThe overlayering of highway flows, optical cabling, wireless transmission and cellphone grids, and \nother \u201epoints of presence\u201f for digital media, with main routes and subroutes, enclaves and barriers \n(Page and Phillips 2003) creates a pattern where high technology features are superimposed on \nremnants and continuing forms of previously dominant technologies. Here, optimists like Mitchell \n(1999) see possibilities for revivifying neighbourhoods, which were formerly either declining \nbecause they were inaccessible for work or relegated to dormitory status. To him, such a \nredistribution of work places would result in \u201eurban tissues \u2026 characterized by live\/work dwellings, \ntwenty four-hour neighbourhoods, loose-knit, far-flung configurations of electronically mediated \nmeeting places\u201f (Mitchell 1999, page 7). While this programmatic claim is overstated, it is then \nimportant to see that in Mitchell\u201fs perspective: \n\u201eUbiquitous interconnection does not mean the end of controllable territory or the \nelimination of the distinction between public and private turf, but it does force us to \nrethink and reinvent these essential constructs in a new context. The emerging \nsystem of boundaries and control points in cyberspace is less visible than the familiar \n10 \nfrontiers, walls, gates, and doorways of the physical world, but it is no less real and \npolitically potent.\u201f (Mitchell 1999, pages 28-9) \n \nThus, there are multiple informational technologies, each depending upon and enabling complex \ngeographies at a variety of interacting and mutually constitutive scales. The fact that in discussions \nof the \u201edigital divide\u201f this has very often been reduced to the physical presence and absence of \nInternet-connected Personal Computers is extremely problematic in its myopia (Selwyn 2002; \nSelwyn 2004). Such a perspective dominates US government reports on digital divides (eg; NTIA \n1999, 2000, 2002) and recurs in geographic efforts that often look at neighbourhoods defined by \ncensus data and then ownership of computers. Two recent -- and rare -- accounts of intra-urban \nICT-based social division in Sydney, Australia, adopt a similarly one-dimensional concept of urban \ndigital divides (Baum 2004, Holloway 2005). However, if we look at the functioning of \ncontemporary cities, we find an array of informational technologies, of which the Internet is only a \nsubset (and PCs a subset of that), many of which are neither visible nor deliberatively used by \npeople. The tendency is for research to focus upon the \u201emore or less enormous impact of new, \nexotic technologies\u201f (Michael 2003, page 128).  But we also need to include \u201ethe more or less subtle \nrole of mundane technologies in everyday life\u201f to match \u201ea fascination with spectacular becoming\u201f \nwith \u201ea concern with sober being\u201f (ibid.). \n \nOur interest is thus very much with the weaving of new technologies into the warp and weft of \neveryday urban life, so that they become increasingly normalised, taken for granted, and thus \nculturally less visible or, as sociologists of technology put it,  \u201eblack boxed\u201f (Feenberg 1992). It is \nincreasingly the case that \u201efrom the point of view of the urban experience, we are entering a built \nenvironment that is increasingly incorporating electronic communication devices everywhere\u201f \n(Castells 2002, page 554). This means that \u201ewherever we go, then, in modern urbanized spaces, we \nare directed by software\u201f which we are schooled not to notice (Thrift and French 2003, page 323; \n11 \nThrift 2004b). Indeed, often these embedded technologies are only apparent when they fail to work \nand disrupt the otherwise smooth functioning of the city. So here we attend to \u201ethe modest but \nconstant hum of connection and interconnection\u201f that has all too often been neglected as a \n\u201etechnological unconscious\u201f through which the world becomes orderly (Thrift 2004b, pages 175, \n177).  \n \nLooking in this way at ICTs distributed through the fabric of cities  allows two significant steps for \nthe purposes of this paper. First, it embeds communication technologies in the prosaic and everyday \nworld rather than setting them apart from everyday life in some separable, \u201evirtual\u201f domain. Second, \nit focuses our attention on how the urban plexus is active and practiced through the \u201etechnicity (the \nproductive power of technology to make things happen) and transduction (the constant making \nanew of a domain in reiterative and transformative practices)\u201f (Dodge and Kitchin 2005, page 162) \nthat the pervasive informational environment entails. Thus, analytically, \u201ean ontogenetic \nunderstanding of space is developed in which space is understood as continually being brought into \nexistence through everyday transductive practices\u201f (page 163).  \n \nConversely, however, we do not wish to succumb to the propaganda about ubiquitous computing. \nAlthough the everyday environment is indeed now saturated more and more by informational \nprocessing, it is worth recalling, first,  that it has always been saturated by information, and, second, \nthat remediation speaks to the concatenation of technologies through more or less effective means. \nSo while (some) buses may have transponders telling (some) passengers at (some) bus-stops the \nlikely arrival time of the next bus, this does not make the vehicle arrive on time. Or, while \u201eWi-Fi\u201f \nenvironments are burgeoning, linking ever more devices together, it is often an awkward and \nunstable process prone to interruption, failure and mysterious collapse (Mackenzie 2005). \n \n12 \nUrban ICTs: Spatialization, Temporalization and Embodiment \n  \nSecond, the question arises as to how people are reshaping daily life through the possibilities and \nlimits of these technologies. How, in other words, does the use of arrays of interlinked ICTs involve \nsimultaneous changes in spatialization, temporalization and embodiment  in the city (Galloway \n2004, pages 404-5)? Arguments that ICTs replace face to face communication have reignited \nquestions on the future of communities (Hampton and Wellman 2003). Neighbourhoods are not just \nresidential locations; they are social arenas in both strong ways, with ties of friends and kin, but also \nweaker ways characterised by nodding acquaintances and conversations at the school gate. In other \nwords, they involve neighbouring as a performative action. We might thus see them constituted and \nreconstituted around specific, sometimes banal, causes and activities (from f\u00eates through to dog \nwalking). These utilise a range of public\/private spaces, intermediaries, institutions and \ncollectivities and a range of media (from shop notice boards, to newsletters, to face to face, to phone \ncontacts) (Laurier, Whyte et al. 2002). Here many have highlighted the dangers, so construed, of \nreplacing communities of proximity with those based on elective interest. Doheny\u2013Farina, for \ninstance, suggests that: \n\u201cnetworked realities individuate us. They encourage us to ignore, forget, or become blind \nto our sense of geographic place and community, and they direct our focus toward the self \nin relation to the mythologies and promises of virtual communities\u201f whereas a real \n\u201ecommunity is bound by place, which always includes complex social and environmental \nnecessities. It is not something you can easily join. You can\u201ft subscribe to a community as \nyou can a discussion group on the net. It must be lived. It is entwined, contradictory and \ninvolves all senses\u201d (1996, pages 14, 37).  \n \nThere has been considerable debate about whether time spent online displaces other (\u201creal\u201d) social \nactivities, or virtual interaction substitures for physical community \u2013 with accounts portraying \n13 \nisolated and alienated \u201enet users, who, as Mitchell pithily put it, are pictured \u201eall huddled at home in \n[their] underwear typing email messages to one another\u201f (1999, page 91).  \n \nThere is indeed a burgeoning literature on online community formations, which points out that they \nare neither \u201einauthentic\u201f nor entirely liberatory \u2013 and indeed contain many of the contradictory \ntendencies found in different social spaces in cities (Crang 2000). Early studies on various online \nfora have continually pointed to the emergence of real, as in meaningful and effective, social \nnetworks via online media from classic uptoianist visions (Rheingold 1993), to more nuanced \naccounts looking at the formations and exclusions (Baym 1998; Gimenez 1997), through to work \ndissecting the impact of different media on different patterns of social links (Haythornthwaite \n2002). Growing from this early concern has been interest in expanded notions of \u201esocial software\u201f, \nas in media designed to enable or facilitate social networks \u2013 be they linking a scattered diasporic or \ntransnational communities (eg Mitra 1997) or enabling a new public fora (Dean 2001). Whether we \nsee the emergence of a new social media such as the \u201eblogsphere\u201f as exemplifying online \ncommunity or a new public realm (Crang 2000), these social media are clearly significant means of \nre-organising political and social collectivities.  \n \nHowever, these accounts tend to read the possibilities for global connectivity via media as meaning \nthe dominance of new global ties, and tend to oppose this to a notion of dense, cohesive, proximate \ncommunity and lived place. Our interest is precisely the ways in which mediated ties and relations \nbecome embedded in lived places. We also want to rethink what place-based communities look like. \nWhile there has been a sophisticated acknowledgement that ICTs are mobilising and enhancing \nsocial networks, with everything from shared calendar functions, to address books, to \u201eWiki\u201f or \ncollaborative authoring software, the connection of this to everyday non-work, embedded networks \nhas been the subject of much less scrutiny, and the movement from activist or specialist networks to \nones that are anchored in local tacit knowledges has still to be accomplished (Davies 2003). \n14 \n \nNeighbourhoods as Mediations of Global and Local Socialities \n \nOur third conceptual starting point is that new mediated networks need not be global but are \nmultiply emplaced; they may not oppose neighbourhood but sustain it. On-line fora such as \u201eNet-\nmums\u201f discussion boards link to, and help remediate, local events and services (see also Madge and \nO'Connor 2002). Along with many other community networking initiatives, they seek to harness \nnew media to local agendas. Others look at the use of digital media and information provision to \nenable participation in community development (Srinivasan 2004). However, such community \nprogrammes tend to define community using a localist definition of close dense ties. Instead, we see \ndifferent media technologies offering different affordances and opportunities for ties and actions at \ndifferent temporal and spatial scales simultaneously (Hampton and Wellman 2002). The evidence \nfrom Hampton\u201fs \u201eNetville\u201f study, for example, suggested that, in a self-consciously \u201ewired \nneighbourhood,\u201f there were more local weak ties, in terms of recognising, speaking to and visiting \nneighbours, among the ICT-connected population than offline groups (Hampton 2003). Moreover, \npeople used \u201emultiple methods of communication: direct in-person contact, telephone, postal mail, \nand more recently fax, email, chats, and email discussion groups\u201f both locally and globally so that \nthe \u201ewired residents of \u201eNetville\u201f neighbored much more extensively and intensively than their non-\nwired counterparts\u201f (Hampton 2002, page 228).  \n \nThis suggests that we need to recognise the promiscuous intermingling of mediated and face to face \ncommunications, just as in the UK nationally 20% talk to a friend daily in person but 21% phone a \nfriend daily (ONS 2001). In other words social networks use multiple media linking online and \noffline worlds of multiple origins, through different technologies at varying scales, and yet:  \n\u201eThe study of new ICTs has maintained the frame of \u201ccommunity\u201d as something that is \nphysically bounded, by geographies of bits and bytes, if not by streets and alleyways. \n15 \nOnline relationships are treated as entities in themselves, isolated from existing social \nnetworks and existing means of communication. Ignoring the cross-cutting nature of \ncommunity has made it impossible to determine if community involvement has decreased \nas a result of ICTs, if it has been shifted to a new medium, or if computer-mediated \ncommunication (CMC) facilitates community on and offline.\u201f(Hampton 2003, page 417) \n \nAs Thrift (2004a) notes, we should be suspicious of the habitual coding of the everyday as small \nscale and local. It is a long established counter position to note a reality where \u201ecommunities are far-\nflung, loosely-bounded, sparsely-knit and fragmentary. Most people operate in multiple, thinly-\nconnected, partial communities as they deal with networks of kin, neighbours, friends, workmates \nand organisational ties\u201f (Wellman 2001, page 227), and where: \n \u201epeople usually have more friends outside their neighborhood than within it: \nindeed, many people have more ties outside their metropolitan areas than within \nit. Their communities consist of far-flung kinship, workplace, interest group, and \nneighborhood ties concatenating to form a network that provides aid, support, \nsocial control, and links to other milieus\u201f (Wellman and Hampton 1999, page \n649). \n \nRemediated Neighbourhoods in Action: A Case Study in Newcastle upon Tyne \n \nWith such a conceptual position established, the rest of this paper seeks to further unpack the \nremediation of urban everyday life through a case study of neighbourhood interactions and  \nhousehold logistics. This material comes from research in Newcastle-upon \u2013Tyne involving \nfieldwork in two contrasting inner suburban neighbourhoods: Jesmond and Blakelaw. Apart from \nsimply a contrast in income -- Jesmond is in the wealthiest fifth of neighbourhoods in the UK, \nBlakelaw in the poorest fifth -- the two neighbourhoods  were selected because they offer  stark \n16 \ncontrasts in the informational landscape. Jesmond has a large group of informational workers, more \npeople use ICTs to bring work home, and there is almost double the use of email and a third more \nonline shopping than in Blakelaw. In terms of social networks, Blakelaw is residentially stable, \nwhile the population of Jesmond is much more fluid \u2013 and thus we would expect an increased scale \nand degree of mediation of social networks. The study involved a stratified postal survey, followed \nup by 50 interviews and time diaries in the neighbourhoods.  \n \nThe rest of this paper, then, focuses upon two aspects of ICT use in the two neighbourhoods. First, \nwe address the imbrication of ICTs in \u201esocial\u201f organisation and the remediation of global and local \nsocialities in the two neighbourhoods. Second,  we analyse the roles of ICTs in the reproduction of \nmore functional aspects of  urban everyday life which surround logistics and transactions.  \n \nTABLE 1 Round HERE \n \nRemediating Global and Local Socialities and Spatialities \n \nOur case study strongly underlined that current urban neighbourhoods exhibit complex mediations \nof global and local socialities and spatialities. One central aspect of new media is the maintenance \nof global connections, but often this is remediating pre-existing delocalised networks. Thus, one \ninterviewee recounted the advantages of email (Interview 34, Jesmond) being \u201every convenient for \nlong distance, you know, intercontinental if you like, very quick and inexpensive and you can do it \nwhen everyone else in Australia is asleep, you can send an email you know and so on and its really \nquite, it is a convenience\u201f enabling them to maintain a global network using time differentials, \nasynchronous communication, and a global client base. Except that this was not a corporate \nundertaking but a small stamp collecting network articulated through new media.  \n \n17 \nEqually, however, our study suggests that it is a mistake to see ICTs as somehow being intrinsically \nopposed to local social networks. Firstly, the use of ICTs was clearly mediated through local social \nnetworks \u2013 as with the respondent who replied that she did not use email since none of her friends \nhad email accounts, so what would be the point? Secondly, and conversely, local connections were \noften intensely mediated. A great number of those contacted by any media were local. Many \nrespondents indicated that media were now crucial in arranging face-to-face social contacts and \norchestrating daily routines within the neighbourhood. People would routinely use email, mobiles, \ntexts and messaging to coordinate their daily lives. Similarly, Valentine and Holloway found that \nchildren not only use email to keep in touch with distant relatives and friends but also those who live \nlocally, especially to arrange face-to-face meetings (2001, page 387). The discussion of multiple media, \nespecially mobile phones, suggests a shift from relatively fixed daily plans, to more flexible ones \u2013 \nconstantly renegotiated in light of changing circumstances in an ongoing process of real-time \ncoordination. We thus observed a lessening reliance on fixed and absolute external times to \ncoordinate action (we will meet at 9pm at Place X) to more direct series of contacts (\u201eI will be there \nin 10 minutes\u201f) (Laurier 2001; Ling 2004, page 70). This is especially, if obviously, the case for \narranging things on the move \u2013 whereas formerly time in transit was time incommunicado, it has \nnow been drawn in to the communicational environment. The implication is clear, then, that media \nplay a large role in enabling more distantiated relationships but we should not minimise the role \nthey play in local ones.  \n \nHow, though, does this interact with the different scales, cultures and spatialities of different lives? \nThe North East region of the UK is notable in official data on \u201esocial capital\u201f as having the highest \nproportion of people who talk to neighbours every day and know their neighbours, to see relatives \ndaily, and people there are three times more likely to be happy with their friendship networks than \nin London (Coulthard, Walker et al. 2002, page 31, 52). Nationally, if we look at the scale of social \nnetworks, 30% of people have at least five close friends living nearby while 27% have no close \n18 \nfriends living in their local area, compared with 16% having at least five close relatives in the \nlocality, and 44% having no relatives they felt close to living nearby (ibid. pages 53-6). In the North \nEast the figures for frequent contacts are the highest in the UK,  with 34% speaking to relatives \ndaily by phone and 26% seeing them in person, while, for friends, 22% spoke daily on the phone \nbut 29% saw them in person every day (page 66).  \n \nThe best predictors of these networks\u201f scales were levels of education and residential mobility. \nThose in social housing were almost twice as likely to have local relatives and friends as those in \nprivate rented accommodation. Our neighborhood comparison allowed us to tease apart possible \ndifferent spatialities of action. Table 1 indicates that Jesmond was almost the archetype of a \nneighbourhood dominated by highly educated, mobile renters while Blakelaw showed very little \nmovement in or out. Perhaps supporting this is the survey return that in Jesmond 44% gave email or \nchat as the most or second most used Internet facility, versus 11% in Blakelaw.  \n \nFor the residentially mobile, or those whose relatives have moved, ICTs provided an important \nmeans of maintaining contacts, and new computer mediated communications have further reduced \notherwise prohibitive international costs for calls and logistical difficulties, with one Jesmond \nrespondent commenting on their limited use of email mostly being to contact a cousin in Mexico \u2013 \nwhere otherwise postal systems were erratic, and communication depended on mailing to an uncle \nin Canada to deliver parcels in person.  \n \nClearly, communication technologies are vital in sustaining long distance ties. Several respondents \nspoke of using email or texts to distant relatives as replacing physical letters and cards, for reasons \nof speed and cost as with one respondent commenting that \u201eI never wrote letters as frequently as I \ndo emails, I never ever got down to writing a letter to a friend, probably ever in my entire life \nbecause I'm such a crap friend. But I send lots of emails to people, you know. I don't know I just \n19 \nfind it a very easy form of communication\u201f (Interview 19). But this is really a new mediation \nbuilding upon an old one. Certainly, informants did not see either telephone or \u201enet links as \nreplacing face-to-face meetings with friends and family \u2013 though, as we shall see, they did use them \nto replace physical trips to utility offices and shops. Logs of contacts most often revealed a dense \npattern of activity designed to orchestrate and support \u201ereal world\u201f social interactions. So, a fairly \nlocalised family from Blakelaw could make as much use of a variety of mediated links: \nR: Well I just phone me mam quite often, grandchildren and my sister's family mainly, \nfamily mainly [\u2026] \nI: Would you say that having the internet at home has made your life easier or more \ndifficult?  \nR: Well it's made it more interesting.  \nI: In what way?   \nR: Well you're able to get on there and have a look around and things like that, and you're \nable to go on the Messenger to your family and friends.  \nI: Do you use the Messenger very much?  \nR: Yes, [partner] does, all the time.  \n \nIn terms of communication activity, then, people often had complex patterns of both distant and \nlocal, mediated and non-mediated contacts \u2013 without the local ones necessarily being the \nunmediated ones. Indeed, several Blakelaw respondents spoke of ICTs helping contact distant \nfamily and kin, but qualified that by saying these were sometimes located up to three miles away. \nAs Haythornwaite (2002) has argued, we can see ICTs enabling new distant or varied \u201eweak\u201f social \nties, while tending to be layered into existing patterns of strong multiply mediated ties.  \n \nA few respondents, who worked in jobs requiring travel and were recent arrivals in Jesmond, \nshowed a bifurcation between very local ties to the neighbourhood and global links. One reflected at \n20 \nlength upon the breakdown of spatial and time barriers in a pressurised working environment. Her \nworkaday life is globally connected, frequently purchasing flights and travel on-line to pursue work \nprojects. She acknowledged how ICTs enabled her to reach people around the world, and work \nacross (and between) two offices a hundred miles apart, while also rueing how ICTs also enabled \nwork to intrude into her home life. And yet, as the latter part of the excerpt below shows, when we \ntracked her everyday out of work \u201eactivity- space,\u201f it was remarkably localised. Such a localised \nurban pattern of dwelling certainly runs counter to the standard model of the car-bound, commuting \nand shopping, well-paid consumer: \nI: Would you say that your mobile phone makes your life easier or more difficult? \nR: I would say now it makes it easier.  I would say for about a four years it sort of made it \nmore difficult because it really was, I could be contacted anyplace, anytime, my boss used \nto ring me up at I don't know, half six in the morning and leave two or three messages \nbefore I'd switch my phone on at half seven and things like that. And God I used to get I \ndon't know how many calls a day, so it just never stopped ringing.  ...    \nI: Do you ever purposefully switch your mobile phone off?   \nR: Yes.    \nR: If I'm going to sleep, because I've forgotten previously and if you've got people working \nin other parts of the world and they just ring you up in the middle of the night you go 'oh \nGod I wish so and so would just  phone off'.   \n[\u2026] \nI: So would you say that there are many occasions when you use the internet instead of \nphysically leaving the house and going to the shops or bank or work?    \nR: Yeah probably, I mean I probably did go out to some shop or bank or something, say \nthree times a week and I don't because I've got the internet. But for food and things like \nthat Tesco's just up the road and because my office is there, so I do all my shopping at \n21 \nTesco Metro really, so I don't tend to leave a fifty yard radius.  \nI: So you probably know foreign cities better than you know Newcastle?   \nR: I can tell you how many times I've been in Newcastle in the two and a half years I've \nlived here, five, probably about five times.  \n \nThis respondent sounds like an archetypal mediated global net-worker. The global intrudes her \nhome life. Yet she is deeply localised in her everyday patterns, to the extent of relying upon the \nneighbourhood rather than the city centre a mile away. So, we do see substitution and bypassing of \nsome parts of the city, but also the remediation of local connections by text, mobile, landline and \nemail, rather than simple substitution of embodied, local relationships by virtual, more distanciated, \nones. That these local links intersect with and are augmented by wider electronically enabled links \nis clear. But the relationships between physical and mediated social contacts seems synergistic \nrather than one substituting for the other. Certainly, of the two neighbourhoods, Jesmond residents \nhad the more extended contacts through the country and indeed globally. In Blakelaw, by contrast, \nproximity of family and social support was notable to the extent that some spoke about \u201edistant\u201f \ncontacts as those in other parts of the city. None of our respondents though used online public local \ncommunity fora or newsgroups, though there was a net-mums system in a neighbouring town. \nSocial software built on private and real world connections, rather than forging new ones. \n \nThe Logistics of Everyday Life \n \nIf, as we have suggested, we can see neighbourhoods remediated through plural media, then it is \nimportant that we do not just focus on the remediation of social relations through ICT use. Rather, \nwe also must also bring back in the material, functional, transactional, logistical and instrumental \naspects of everyday life \u2013 to see how different technologies affect the orchestration and logistics of \nurban living. The phone or Internet are not simply used to communicate with friends; they are also \n22 \nthe basis for a rapidly expanding universe of electronically mediated economic, retail and service \ntransactions. Often, this  shift is spoken of in terms of e-commerce substituting distant for local \nsuppliers. However, once again, our evidence suggests that the scalar relations between e-commerce \ntransactions and traditional, face-to-face ones are much more complex and subtle.  For example, \nJesmond dwellers, though twice as likely to use e-shopping as Blakelaw respondents, were actually \nmore likely to use, and, consequently, walk through the neighbourhood to local shops (see table 1). \nSometimes they did this self-consciously to resist \u201eglobalisation\u201f ; some even reflexively discussed \nwhether or not online shopping \u201eover-privatised\u201f society. Non-users of e-shopping for groceries in \nJesmond, for instance, reported a wish to either physically inspect the produce or referred to the \nenjoyments of watching other people and engaging with \u201ecommunity\u201f in the local supermarket. \nThere might, then, be a desire to realise \u201ecommunity\u201f through local shopping, while also a using the \nInternet to escape some actually existing community\u201fs flaws: \u201eI'd be more inclined\u201f, reported one \nrespondent, \u201eto shop on the Internet to avoid Jesmond Tesco's and the students [there] to be honest. \nI shouldn't be saying that\u201f. Indeed, local shops and facilities were repeatedly mentioned in Jesmond \nas locales for feeling part of the community \u2013 not through deep ties but where \u201enewsagents know \nme\u201f, and you \u201ebump into people\u201f and \u201eknow the people in the convenience store\u201f.  \n \nOnline grocery shopping, in fact, emerged in our study as a premier example of a hybrid form \nblending online and offline structures, where the \u201ecommunity\u201f aspects of embodied shopping in and \naround urban neighbourhoods jostles with  the new possibilities of e-mediated transactions and \nwhat we might call remediated food shopping. Clearly, e-grocery shopping involves providing \nmaterial, often bulky, objects to consumers. Moreover, in terms of infrastructures, early dot.com \ncompanies, with integrated online supply systems linking mouse to supplier, withered quickly and \nleft existing supermarkets, who had been derided for their \u201einelegant\u201f combination of downloading \ncustomer orders for workers to walk around and pick up from the shelves of existing local stores, to \ndominate the market (Murphy, 2004).  \n23 \n \nIn effect, then, the supply system hardly alters with e-groceries \u2013 it is merely goods being chosen \nremotely and delivered, rather than going to the same store to pick them up. Crucially, however, the \ndifference that ICTs make to the neighbourhood is in the timing and organisation of the task. In \nterms of orchestrational logistics, a few of our respondents cited its benefits in terms of a reduced \namount of time taken. Mostly, this was because of reducing time taken up by travel. But the main \ndriver was timeshifting. Thus, online grocery shopping may be no quicker at all, but if it can be \ndone in the evening it may fit around other more valued or constrained tasks \u2013 such as work hours, \nchild care or so forth. Thus, one respondent from Jesmond was clear about the main reason for \ngrocery shopping online: \u201eOh certainly because you don't have to think 'have I got a window to run \nout at lunch time?' \u2026.  So I just feel I don't have to make the journey if I want to sit and do it at \nmidnight in the comfort of my own home, I can do, and I think that's control\u201f.  \n \nThe same respondent later reflected that overcoming spatial distance was one aspect of e-grocery \ntransactions, but only in the particular sense of bringing home large quantities of goods, rather than \nincreasing distance to stores: \nWhere I lived in Kingston Park [a suburban estate of Newcastle] I was all of seven \nminutes walk away from Tesco, I quite frequently did my shopping by internet \nwith Tesco because \u2026 I thought 'what's the point of me going and coming  back \nwith arms like gibbons trying to carry great weights?', so I would do big bulk \nshopping, and a man in a van would come and bring it to you.   Since I've moved I \nhaven't used it and I'm slightly further away from the shops \u2026 I've just got out of \nthe habit of using the Internet for it. \n \nContrary to most assumptions, then, as this respondent moves further from the shops she stops \nusing ICTs. Her first reason was the time she felt would be needed setting up the accounts and \n24 \norders again. In other words, the time saving of e-groceries was via its routinisation \u2013 whose \neventual speed and ease had to be offset against learning a new process. Others pointed to \nunintentional financial savings, following time savings, gained not through better online prices but \nthe way online shopping tends to be more instrumental, reducing impulse purchases. One  Blakelaw \nrespondent prioritised the Internet as making life easier by saving him and his wife time since with \ngroceries \u201ethis nice man comes in a van once you've sent an email to him\u201f even though the shop is \n\u201ejust down the road \u2026 it just saves so much time, so much hassle, its actually saved more money \ndoing it as well to be perfectly honest.. because you tend to just pick what you want rather than \ngoing in and thinking 'oh I'll have that, that and that'\u201f.  \n \nThese respondents discussed e-groceries as overcoming temporal obstacles rather than ones of long \ndistances. However, a range of responses showed that, although purchase times become more fluid, \nand separated from the time of delivery, time for delivery becomes very fixed. Indeed, the second \nreason given by our previous respondent for stopping e-shopping was that, due to changing work \npatterns, it had become harder to guarantee when someone would be at home to receive the \ngroceries.  \n \nThus, for everyday logistics like e-grocery shopping, time was not simply a matter of flexible \nordering. The time horizons, the time of delivery and the durability of the goods were all further \ntime factors people dealt with in online grocery provisioning. If online groceries were seen to offer \nsome time flexibility, they were also seen to create other time constraints and many were cautious \nin their assessments. Although purchase times became more fluid, receipt became fixed and \nnecessitated someone being predictably at home. Likewise, respondents remarked that they also had \nto have predictable lifestyles to be able to order in advance. They had to also control the longevity \nof produce \u2013 with some reporting their careful plans being derailed by short \u201euse-by\u201f dates. The \ndifficulties were elegantly expressed by one Blakelaw respondent: \n25 \nR: I've tried shopping in the Internet, Tesco's, and don't think much of it because I found a \nlot of the stuff was just going out of date, whereas if you go on your own, you can have a \nlook at the sell by dates and you can have a feel, feel your food, but I just go to Safeway \nbecause its only five minutes up the road. \nI: Apart from the freshness of the food was there any other problems with it?  \nR: Getting the delivery as well, sometimes the deliveries were a bit inconvenient, my \nfriend just did, you know, she'd say she'd be in say, its Wednesday today, she'd be in \ntomorrow, but they couldn't deliver until the Friday and she'd be at work, so she'd have to \narrange someone to sit in the house while it got delivered or wait until the night when \nsometimes you know, you like your shopping in, you like to know like when its coming. \n \nThese responses show some simple timeshifting and space-shifting\u2013 moving grocery shopping from \nlunch time in town to late evening at home - and  usefully reveal some of the new constraints this \nimposes. However, if we link this to our discussion of neighbourhood contacts, we also find the \nmedia \u201edown-time\u201f in the day, and the \u201eporosity\u201f of schedules, both being filled by the ability to do \ntasks broken into smaller components. A new \u201eporosity,\u201f created as activities are undertaken in \ndifferent places, also emerges. There are thus very many accounts from our respondents of work \nbeing done from home, a few of home-provisioning being done from work, but also many detailing \nhow more mobile technologies also enabled the use of formerly \u201edead time-space\u201f. Like other \nresearchers (eg. Jain 2002), we found that the locational flexibility offered by mobile phones \nenabled some people to use \u201edead time\u201f -- for instance waiting for the bus -- turning it into a \n\u201euseful\u201f periods, enabling especially informational workers to pack in more activities, and intensify \ntheir existing networks:   \nR: \u201e..the only think I do differently is talk to people while I'm walking and you know, I \nwouldn't, its not that I talk to more people or different people, its not that I would now \nmake telephone calls that I wouldn't have made without the mobile phone.  The only thing \n26 \nis that I might make them at different times, I can use the telephone when I, I can multi-\ntask, I can make a telephone call and walk to work at the same time, but that, its not the \nwhat it's the where and  when that's different.\u201f \n \nOur study thus suggests that the place of access and mode of access is indeed also enabling different \nlocations for different activities. Public facilities were rarely used for household organisation \u2013 \nsince they lacked the convenience that was the motivation and did not offer either reliable access or \nsecurity of data. Mobile devices, from phones to WAP, to Wi-Fi laptops, were enabling a few to \nperform household provisioning on the go, though mostly this entailed the use of mobile phones to \norchestrate and schedule of other interactions within future urban time-space. Most strongly the \nseparation of home and work for some, usually skilled professionals, was being bridged by these \ntechnologies \u2013 allowing them to fit more in to their time, but also bringing more demands of what \nthey should fit in. \n \nConclusions \n \nThis paper has demonstrated that the emerging informational environment in cities is far from just a \nmatter of some putatively \u201evirtual\u201f domain substituting for local, material spaces and practices of \nurban life. The idea, so common in the first generation of literatures speculating on the links \nbetween ICTs and cities, that, for better or worse, mediated interactions would replace face-to-face \nones, has proven a narrow and misplaced one. There is no simple removal of the time-space \nconstraints of daily life through new ICTs. Their multiple roles in the city certainly enable new \nforms of activity. But they also create their own constraints, as they are mobilised to remediate the \nsocial relationships, transactional patterns and logistical flows that together constitute everyday \nurban life. ICT use, and urban remediation, thus creates its own demands \u2013 from employers and \nassociates \u2013 for contactability, for flexibility of scheduling, and rapid response. This occurs through \n27 \na multiplicitous array of  interacting media, at different levels of tangibility and conscious use, \nwhich operate continually through a  telescoping range of spatial scales. At the level of \nneighbourhood users, we can see new media being woven in to daily life -- from voice links of all \nsorts to text and computer messaging, through to web-commerce. This is occurring both to enable \nlocal and distantiated interaction, and to remediate the subtle trade-offs between them. Such \nremediations, moreover, emerge as  crucial, and increasingly normalised, ways in which households \nmanage to orchestrate complex schedules \u2013 schedules whose very complexity is partly enabled by \nthe increasingly normalised expectancy of the remediation of everyday urban life through ICTs.  \n \nHowever, we must also be conscious that the use of ICTs to remediate the social interactions and \nlogistical processes that help to constitute everyday urban life are also clearly overcoded with a \nrange of less intentional informational landscapes. The use and construction of neighbourhoods is \nnot just enabled by social software but also increasingly filtered by geodemographic systems which \nare online, used by public and private bodies to allocate servicesand able to mass-customise \ngeodemographic profiles, sometimes open to the public,  and then recursively used by \nneighbourhood residents or those considering house moves  (Burrows, Ellison et al. 2005, \nAndrejevic, 2003). Meanwhile, embedded devices, surveillance systems, and software are using this \nsort of data to categorise and prioritise flows of information \u2013 so that those going online to \u201eescape \nthe tyranny of geography\u201f may well have their speed and functionality of access determined by that \nvery geography (Graham 2005). The informational landscapes of neighbourhoods, and their \nremediation,  thus emerges as a multidimensional set of simultaneous, interacting processes which \nare infused by the new politics of place (Amin and Thrift, 2004).  \n \nIt follows that, in assessing the neighbourhood impacts of ICTs, we need to move beyond just static \ndescriptions of neighbourhood areas \u2013 so often defined by where people are sleeping \u2013 to an \nunderstanding of the dynamic and continually emerging time-space of place. Neighbourhoods are \n28 \ncomprised of multiple routines and rhythms that may from a compatible or clashing whole, as the \ndifferent, remediating, tempos, timings and durations come together (Crang 2001). But, more than \njust the delicate, physical ballet that time geography depicted, this paper has shown how the paths, \ninteractions and connections that people form are woven and remediated through intersecting arrays \nof new media. Thus, relations may occur at many scales at once, or at one scale yet spread over \ntime.  Complex strategies which exploit the remediated and hybrid worlds of on and offline social \ninteraction and logistical coordination thus emerge as a key feature of informational urban life. In \nthese, the synchronisation -- bringing together at a time -- and synchorisation -- bringing to the \nsame place -- of different elements of city life are no longer inevitably linked. The recombination of \ndifferent times and spaces for activities that ICTs now mediate is one of the most important \npossibilities. The consequential effects of how the capacities in different ICTs interact, and how the \nconsequences of one interact with consequences of others, is an important ongoing agenda \nreshaping the lived practice of contemporary society. \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nThe authors would like to thank the ESRC\u201fs E-Society Programme (award RES-335-25-0015) for \nsupport which made this research possible. \n \n29 \n \nReferences: \nAmin, A. and N.
