INTRODUCTION\nLead salts are of interest both fundamentally, because of\ntheir interesting band structure, and from a device point of\nview since they are widely used in midinfrared ~MIR! opto-\nelectronic emitters and detectors. A particular feature of this\nsystem\u2014i.e., their near \u2018\u2018mirror\u2019\u2019 conduction and valence\nbands\u2014has been cited as potentially leading to much smaller\nAuger scattering rates than found in III-V material systems.\nHowever, theory predicts that there may nevertheless still\nremain a substantial contribution to this unwanted recombi-\nnation process through intervalley scattering,1\u20134 although\nlater theories,2\u20134 including more realistic band-structure pic-\ntures, suggest that this should not be as serious as originally\npredicted.1 Understanding accurately how the recombination\nprocesses change with carrier density is important for emis-\nsion devices which operate far from equilibrium, and in par-\nticular in the continuing quest for the development of com-\npact MIR room-temperature lasers. A recent design study\nsuggesting the possibility of cw room-temperature MIR op-\neration of GaSb\/PbSe\/GaSb double heterostructure lasers5\ndepends critically on the theoretical prediction of a low value\nof Auger coefficient C.4 Although considerable research has\nbeen done on the recombination processes, with the excep-PRB 580163-1829\/98\/58~19!\/12908~8!\/$15.00tion of one report6 almost all previous work has utilized tech-\nniques using relatively long pulse or cw radiation, and ex-\nperimentally reported values for C vary over an order of\nmagnitude.6\u20138\nWe have made direct pump-probe measurements of radia-\ntive and nonradiative recombination in epilayers of PbSe un-\nder high excitation with an rf linac-pumped ~ps! free-electron\nlaser ~FELIX!, in the temperature range 30\u2013300 K. For tem-\nperatures below 200 K and carrier densities above the thresh-\nold for stimulated emission, stimulated recombination repre-\nsents the most efficient recombination mechanism with\nkinetics in the 50\u2013100-ps regime, in good agreement with\nearlier reports.6,9,10 Above this temperature Auger recombi-\nnation dominates on a 0.1\u20132-ns time scale. The sophistica-\ntion of a three-beam pump-probe experimental technique de-\nscribed below has enabled an analysis of the decay at times\nlonger than 100 ps in terms of the nonparabolic anisotropic\nband structure of the lead salts, to give the Auger coefficient\nC qualitatively over a wide temperature range 30\u2013300 K.\nThe results are in good agreement with theory for nonpara-\nbolic, anisotropic bands11,12 and nondegenerate statistics,2\nand confirm that the original parabolic band calculations1\nunderestimated the measured lifetime by more than an order\nof magnitude.2\u20134,6 Finally the Auger results for the lead salts12 908 \u00a91998 The American Physical Society\nPRB 58 12 909AUGER RECOMBINATION DYNAMICS OF LEAD SALTS . . .are compared with earlier measurements taken at FELIX\n~Ref. 13! for Hg12xCdxTe of a composition such that the\nband gap for the two semiconductors is the same at T5100\nK.13 It is found that C for PbSe is between one and two\norders of magnitude lower than for Hg12xCdxTe over the\nwhole temperature range for comparable values of the band\ngap. This results in domination of stimulated radiative re-\ncombination even at quite low carrier concentrations.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe samples were ~111!-oriented epitaxial layers of PbSe\non insulating substrates (BaF2). They were grown by\nmolecular-beam epitaxy under ultrahigh-vacuum\nconditions.14 The samples were ;2 mm thick with an n-type\ncarrier concentration of 3.231017 cm23and a mobility of\n28 070 cm2 V21 s21at 77 K. The wavelength-degenerate\npump-probe experiments were performed with the Dutch\nfree electron laser in Utrecht ~FELIX!, which operated with\npulse trains ~\u2018\u2018macropulses\u2019\u2019! typically of length 4 ms and at\na repetition rate of 5 Hz. The macropulse consisted of a train\nof \u2018\u2018micropulses,\u2019\u2019 each of width adjustable between 2 and\n10 ps, with a pulse separation of 40 ns. It was shown\npreviously13,15 that, over the range of excited electron con-\ncentrations used throughout this study, the carrier tempera-\ntures approach the lattice temperature to within 2% in less\nthan 3 ps, resulting in a temperature increase in the sample of\nonly ;0.02 K per pulse. Hence we have neglected heating\neffects and, for recombination processes which occur in less\nthan about 20 ns ~see below!, we have treated the interpre-\ntation in the same way as for a \u2018\u2018single pulse\u2019\u2019 experiment.\nThe macropulse fluctuations of FELIX depend strongly\non the required performance of the machine, and can be of\norder 10%. In order to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio in\nthe MIR regime, we have utilized a pump-probe setup which\ncompensates for these macropulse fluctuations. The experi-\nmental arrangement is a three-beam pump-probe-reference\nsetup shown in Fig. 1. From the original pump pulse both a\nprobe beam and a reference beam are split off by ZnSe\nbeamsplitters. The reference beam is delayed by 20 ns ~6 m!,\nFIG. 1. Schematic diagram of the three-beam pump-probe ex-\nperimental setup, utilizing a modulation technique to determine the\nrelative transmission of the probe beam as a function of delay time\nas described in the text.and back-reflected on the beamsplitter with a 21 telescope\nonto the probe beam position. The probe and reference\nbeams follow the same optical path, transmit through the\nsample at the same position, and are both detected by the\nsame ~77 K! MCT detector. It is assured independently that\nboth have the same original size. The detector bias is modu-\nlated with 25 MHz, synchronized with FELIX. This results\nin signals with opposite sign for the probe and the reference\nbeams. When the system is in balance ~no pump is applied!,\nthe integrating electronics show an apparent output signal of\nthe detector which is zero. In the experiment the pump beam\nis chopped with 2.5-Hz frequency ~every other pump pulse is\nblocked! and the signal fed into a boxcar integrator in the\ntoggle mode. The result is a signal-to-noise ratio better than\n0.1%, even when the fluctuations from macropulse to mac-\nropulse are several percent. The three beams were focused on\nthe sample using an f 525 cm parabolic mirror, resulting in a\nspotsize of 100 mm. The sample was mounted in a flow\ncryostat ~4\u2013300 K!. The effective pump and probe energy\nfluences per micropulse were estimated to be 350 and 10\nmJ\/cm2, respectively, including losses due to beamsplitters\nand optics. The relative transmittance of the probe was mea-\nsured directly as a function of optical delay, tdelay, between\npump and probe pulses.\nBand filling as the pump radiation is absorbed causes a\nstrong dynamic blueshift in the IR absorption edge ~the dy-\nnamic Moss-Burstein shift!, and leads to pronounced bleach-\ning near the excitation frequency. Recovery times in the\nrange 20\u2013800 ps were found, and shown to be strongly de-\npendent on the sample temperature and the excited carrier\ndensity. In agreement with previous workers,6 we have found\nthat at room temperature and at the pump intensities ~excited\ncarrier densities! used here the recombination is dominated\nby Auger scattering as shown in Fig. 2 ~and see the analysis\nbelow!. Below 200 K, stimulated recombination represents\nthe most efficient recombination mechanism with kinetics in\nthe 100-ps regime, as shown in Fig. 3. At times longer than\n100 ps, the Auger process takes over in the absence of stimu-\nlated recombination. For all temperatures the net recombina-\ntion rate in the high excitation regime is a fundamental prop-\nerty of the material, and not defect related.13,15 Analysis of\nthe recovery of the probe absorption leads to a quantitative\ndetermination of the temperature dependence of the thresh-\nold concentration for stimulated emission and the Auger co-\nefficient, as described below.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nIn order to interpret the data of Figs. 2 and 3, we need to\nconvert the measured transmission into values of excited car-\nrier concentration Ne . The rate of decay of Ne(t) with\npump-probe delay can then be extracted directly, and Auger\nrecombination coefficients can be obtained by fitting Ne(t)\nwith a simple rate equation. The recovery time of the bleach-\ning depends on the photon energy hn , due to the carrier-\nconcentration-dependent relaxation process. The value of Ne\nat complete bleaching corresponds to the carrier density re-\nquired to separate the electron and hole quasi-Fermi energies\nby an amount equal to the pump photon energy, and in-\ncreases monotonically with hn . We assume that the carriers\nthermalize rapidly compared with the recombination rate, in\n12 910 PRB 58P. C. FINDLAY et al.FIG. 2.

With the measured lifetimes substantially longer than\nthe pulse duration ~5 ps!, the generation rate is zero during\nthe probe pulse delay time, and the recombination rate g,\nwhich is some function of Ne(t), can be measured unam-\nbiguously.\nWe may similarly neglect the pulse duration @i.e., the\nprobe pulse shape function I(t) is effectively a d function#\nwhen calculating the sample transmission.\nT'~12R !2exp@2a~ tdelay!d# . ~1!We have assumed that the absorption coefficient a, while\ntime dependent, is approximately constant through the\nprobed region of the sample ~the initial concentration is spa-\ntially uniform for complete bleaching!. R is the sample re-\nflectivity, and d the thickness. The dependence of the trans-\nmission on the reflectivity is complicated by the different\nvalues for the top PbSe layer, the bottom BaF2 layer, and the\ninterface between the epilayer and the substrate. This prob-\nlem is removed in our signal processing method, where we\ntake the ratio of the measured difference in the probe and\nreference transmission to the reference transmission. In this\nway the dependence of the reflectivity is removed, leaving us\nwith an expression relying solely on the change in the ab-\nsorption coefficient Da, resulting from the pump:FIG. 3.

The solid line is fitted from Eqs. ~3!\u2013~7! to determine the value of the\nsmall signal absorption cross section.The procedure is then to use a knowledge of the non-\nspherical, nonparabolic lead salt band structure ~see below!,\nwhich determines the ~final and initial! electron and hole\nenergies Ee and Eh for electron-hole pair creation at a given\nphoton energy, and also the density-of-state functions geand\ngh .

This is shown in Fig. 4, utilizing Eqs.\n~4!\u2013~7! ~below! for the theoretical fit. We estimate the over-\nall error in deriving the carrier concentration from the pump-\nprobe measurement is about 30%, leading to an error in the\nAuger coefficient of about 60%.\nIntraband and interband magneto-optical experiments on\nPbSe have been interpreted previously using a k\u0096p model\nwhich takes into account the levels forming the minimumgap but in addition two other pairs of \u2018\u2018far\u2019\u2019 valence and\nconduction bands are introduced to order k2.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWe can now calculate the value of the excited carrier\nconcentration, Ne(tdelay), corresponding to each value of\ntransmission, T(tdelay). As described previously, we have\nalso included the effect of small refractive index changes\narising from a shift in the plasma frequency.13 Typical plots\nof Ne versus tdelay are shown in Figs. 5\u20137 for 300, 150, and\n77 K, respectively, showing clearly the rapid decay associ-\nated with stimulated emission at low temperatures which\ndoes not appear at room temperature at the excitation level of\nthe present experiment. It has been shown previously6 that\nthe carrier system of PbSe and PbTe becomes degenerate at\nthe values of Ne generated here for temperatures below 160\nK, with the quasi-Fermi levels shifted into the bands, giving\nthe possibility of stimulated emission under the condition\nE f\nc1E f\nv.0. ~8!FIG. 6.

Computed excited carrier concentration Ne vs tdelay obtained from the pump-probe transmission results as described in the text for\nT577 K and a pump wavelength 4.7 mm. The solid curve is the best fit from Eq. ~9!. The calculated value of C is 5310228 cm6 s21.The spontaneously emitted photons are amplified in the in-\nverted sample, resulting in an exponential increase in photon\nnumber and a decrease of carrier density. Computed results\nfor absorption and gain versus energy for different values of\nexcited carrier concentrations are shown in Fig. 8. The\nstimulated emission reduces the carrier concentration very\nefficiently until it decreases below a threshold value defined\nby Eq. ~8!. The correlation of the onset of stimulated emis-\nsion with the ps recombination kinetics shows that the carrier\ndensity in the excited volume is preferentially reduced by\nstimulated recombination at early delay times. From our ob-\nservations of Ne versus tdelay plots at temperatures in the\nrange 30\u2013300 K we have determined the threshold value of\nNe as a function of temperature as shown in Fig. 9.

It was found in all cases that Auger\nrecombination dominated and the other terms were negli-\ngible, and in particular that the Ne\n3 dependence expected for\na nondegenerate carrier distribution gave a very good fit to\nthe data. A similar result was obtained in the 300 K case in\nRef. 6. The value of C obtained by this fitting procedure is\nshown plotted over the full temperature range 30\u2013300 K in\nFig. 10. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment\nis obtained with the Auger process for intervalley scattering\nin the approximation of nondegenerate statistics, but it is\nclearly essential to include a realistic nonparabolic band\nstructure.2 The difference between the parabolic and nonpa-\nrabolic approximations is most clearly seen in the low-\ntemperature regime where the Auger coefficient drops mark-\nedly between 77 and 30 K. Finally the Auger results for the\nlead salts are compared with earlier measurements taken at\nFELIX for Hg0.795Cd0.205Te ~experiment and theory13,20,21!\nand Hg0.744Cd0.256Te ~theory21!. Since there is such ex-\ntremely good agreement between the theory and nonpara-\nbolic bands and the isotropic Kane model, the latter curve\n~with the same band gap as PbSe at 100 K\u2014i.e., lG;7 mm!\nis taken for comparison between the two materials. It is\nfound that C for PbSe is between one and two orders of\nmagnitude lower than for Hg12xCdxTe at comparable values\nof the band gap. Stimulated emission was not observed in the\n12 914 PRB 58P.

We estimate the threshold car-\nrier concentration for this material would be about 8\n31017 cm23, which is some four times greater than\nachieved in the earlier experiments.13,20\nOne other clear difference between the two systems is in\nthe dependence of C on temperature. Both PbSe and\nHg12xCdxTe ~of this composition! are anomalous in that the\nband gap decreases with lowering temperature. However, in\nthe case of Hg12xCdxTe, because of the low ratio of electron\nto heavy-hole effective mass arising from the Kane band\nstructure, which decreases further with decreasing band gap,\nthe threshold for Auger recombination drops with reducingtemperature. This band gap dependence dominates over the\nchange of the occupation function with temperature. By con-\ntrast, the ratio of electron to hole effective mass for PbSe is\napproximately unity over the whole range of values of EG .\nIn this case reducing the temperature below threshold\nquenches the Auger recombination.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn summary, we have utilized a ps free-electron laser to\nmeasure directly the Auger recombination rates as a function\nof photonexcited carrier concentration in PbSe over a wide\ntemperature range ~30\u2013300 K!. The rate is approximately\nconstant between 77 and 300 K, with a value C58\n310228 cm6 s21, and then drops to a value of C51\n310228 cm6 s21 at 30 K. Good agreement is obtained withFIG. 10.

This is in ac-\ncord with the finding that C for PbSe is between one and two\norders of magnitude lower than for InSb or Hg12xCdxTe of\ncomparable values of the band gap. The small Auger coeffi-\ncients in the lead salts are mitigated to some extent by the\nrelatively heavy anisotropic effective masses and valley de-\ngeneracy, which would tend, by contrast, to higher threshold\ncarrier concentrations than for Hg12xCdxTe or III-V materi-als of comparable band gaps ~assuming comparable internal\nlosses!.\nWe confirm the conjecture made recently that Auger re-\ncombination in IV-VI semiconductors in the wavelength\nrange of 3\u20135 mm will not prevent quantum structures of\nthese materials from achieving room-temperature laser\noperation.6 Rather, it is the problems of insufficient electron\nand hole confinement and low thermal conductivity from tra-\nditionally used materials, PbEuSeTe, PbSrSe, or PbSrS, that\nhave to be overcome by the utilization of structures such as\nGaSb\/PbSe\/GaSb.5\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge the EPSRC for the support of this work.\nWe are grateful to DERA Malvern for financial support\n~C.M.C. and P.C.F.!.
