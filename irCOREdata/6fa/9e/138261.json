In particular, nine demographic factors are identified as\naffecting the manner in which the role of chairman is exercised in the\nUK, USA and Australia.\nResearch limitations: The findings of this qualitative exploratory study need to be integrated\ninto a quantitative empirical survey in order to ascertain the validity of\nthe results to date.\n3Practical\nimplications:\nThe two key conclusions, that each role incumbent has extensive\ndiscretion to shape and determine the chairman role as well as\nnational demographic characteristics influencing the practice of\nchairmanship, highlights the requirement for governance due\ndiligence, examining the financial and competitive strength of the\norganisation as well as uncovering contextual sensitivities. Each\nposition of chairman is different to the other.\nWhat is original\/\nvalue of paper:\nInsufficient attention has been given to the role of chairman. The\nstudy offers additional insight on how demographic factors influence\nthe shaping and determination of the role of chairman. This paper\nshould be of interest to practitioners, consultants, line managers, board\nmembers, chairmen, management academics and business studies\nstudents.\n4Chairman of the Board: Demographics Effects on Role Pursuit\nAcknowledgements\nOur deepest thanks to Lord Tom Sawyer, House of Lords, UK, who has been powerfully\ninstrumental in negotiating access to British chairmen and chief executive officers (CEOs) for\nthe purpose of research. Also, our warmest thanks to Ellen Van Velsor, Center for Creative\nLeadership, North Carolina, USA, for having made possible interviews with some of\nAmerica\u2019s top chairmen and chief executives. Special mention is made of Kate Donaghy,\nManchester Square Partners, entrepreneur, counsellor and one who is accomplished at placing\nthe most capable of executives in the most demanding of jobs, in providing for us access to\nsome of the UK\u2019s finest top managers. In similar vein, David Pumphrey, Partner, Heidrick\nand Struggles, Australia, with his insight and understanding of the Australasian corporate\nboardroom, not only provided access to a unique group of top business leaders in Australia\nbut also offered advice invaluable to the success of this study. Thanks also to Ruth Barratt for\ntesting our initial findings with UK and US board members.\nMost of all, we are deeply indebted to Severstal, the Russian Steel company, who have\nsponsored and financially supported the research reported in this paper. Severstal\u2019s devotion\nto promoting learning acts as example of what are the characteristics of a world class\ncompany.\n5Arising as a counter to US and UK corporate corrupt practice of the 1980s and 1990s, greater\nattention to governance protocols introduced discipline to board processes and procedures in\norder to safeguard the interests of the shareholders of the enterprise. Either as a result of\nlegislation or \u2018voluntary\u2019 code emanating from securities commissions, stock exchanges,\ninvestors associations as well as supranational organisations (OECD, 1999), and despite\nvariance in scope and detail, boards are increasingly being required to display attentiveness to\nfour fundamental principles of governance (Coombes and Wong, 2004), namely;\n\uf0b7 the upholding of shareholder rights;\n\uf0b7 clarity of accountability for both the board and management which, in turn, has\nspawned greater attention to the role, purpose and contribution of both entities;\n\uf0b7 the accuracy, transparency and timeliness of financial and non financial reporting; and\n\uf0b7 attendance to the interests of minority shareholders and other pertinent stakeholders.\nAs a result, the enterprise is required to provide a financial return on shareholder investment,\nwhich commentators as Kay and Silbertson (1995) point out, is the sole purpose of the\npublicly quoted company. Thus, two counter balancing pressures are prevalent on the board\nof the Anglo-American enterprise, the realising of profit for shareholders involving the\nexercising of governance disciplines for the protection of shareholder rights, and the nurturing\nof a proactive business culture for the purpose of financial and reputational gain. The\njuggling of interests to achieve both ends falls on the shoulders of the chairman of the board, a\nposition that has reached public prominence as much due to the popular emergence of\ncorporate governance (Hanson and Song, 2000; Kakabadse et al., 2006).\nGovernance, Controls and the Chairman\n6The requirement for profitability within the Anglo-American governance model of dispensed\nshareholder ownership within a liquid capital market whilst simultaneously promoting\nshareholder rights, has introduced two mechanisms of control over the affairs of the\ncorporation; internal and external (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001). The internal control\nmechanism is exercised through the one-tier board, composed of executive and non executive\ndirectors in the UK and Australian context and that of \u2018outside\u2019 directors in the USA, who are\nrecognised as independent or \u2018grey\u2019 directors that have a close but indirect relationship with\nthe firm (Hanson and Song, 2000). The long standing and still unchallenged contribution of\neach board director is to represent shareholders, namely the owners of the corporation, by\nholding accountable the management of the enterprise (Berle and Means, 1932).\nExternal control consists of market forces such as distinct competitive factors in particular\nmarkets, developments in capital markets and labour markets, with the exercise of control\nbeing totally in the remit of professional management (Berle and Means, 1932; Jensen and\nMeckling, 1976). In themselves, market based competitive factors are considered to play a\ncritical monitoring role as far as the company\u2019s performance is concerned (Berle and Means,\n1932). For example, under-performing firms become an easy take-over target, often resulting\nin management and the board being replaced by the acquirer (Monk and Minow, 2004).\nAdditionally, competitiveness in the labour market, especially in the executive recruitment\nmarket is significant in terms of external control as it is challenging for a declining company\nto attract high performing talent at a time when such talent is most needed (Monk and Minow,\n2004).\nPrior to the emergence of the governance movement, each shareholder in possession of a\nmajority or minority holding, when concerned about firm performance or reporting issues,\n7would more likely \u2018vote with their feet\u2019 (sell their shares) than actively participate in\nexercising their rights, such as the monitoring and dismissal of management. A simple cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis of the day showed \u2018it is not worth it\u2019, it being to, \u201cexercise ownership rights\nand become involved in the affairs of the enterprise for that would incur the total cost of\nintervention for only a pro rata share of the gains, and even then if there is any\u201d (Monk and\nMinow, 2004). Thus, managers were left considerably free to adopt an \u2018oligarchic\u2019 presence\nand style. One role in particular has, and continues to have, the potential to allow its\nincumbent to behave in an aloof and unchecked manner, and that is that of the chief executive\nofficer (CEO). The CEO role is a full-time post, embracing the responsibility for the day-to-\nday running of the company and for the setting (for most corporations) and implementing of\ncorporate strategy (Cadbury, 1992; Dahya and Travlos, 2000; Weir and Laing, 2001). The\nlong established practice of including the CEO on the corporate board is to allow board\nmembers direct access to this critical officer for the purposes of holding him\/her accountable\nfor the performance of the firm and for communicating progress towards the realisation of\nstrategic and operational goals (Gioia and Chittipeddi, 1991: 442; Gioia and Thomas, 1996;\nWard, 1996).\nWith the recognition that an unrestrained CEO and his\/her team were a prime root of\ncorporate excess, the role of chairman in UK and Australian companies was elevated to the\nrole of the \u2018keeper of the board\u2019 and also the \u2018minder of the CEO\u2019 (Kakabadse et al., 2006).\nThe monitoring of management by the non executive directors (NEDs) and the holding of the\nCEO accountable by the chairman allowed boards to gain a greater role in strategy\nformulation, providing independent judgement on senior executive appointments and\ndetermining performance related rewards. Thus, whether part-time, full-time, executive or\nnon executive, emphasis has increasingly been placed on the chairman\u2019s effective leadership\n8of the board as well as the \u2018mentoring\u2019 of the CEO and executive management (Cadbury,\n1992; Dahya and Travlos, 2000; Weir and Laing, 2001). According to Cadbury (1992),\nchairmen hold the responsibility of stewarding boardroom affairs by, for example, ensuring\nthat non executive directors are in receipt of relevant information for board meetings (as well\nas any other pertinent company information) as well as to audit the affairs of the firm and\ndetermine the structure of remuneration for its senior full-time officers. In order to maintain\nimpartiality, Cadbury (1992), and Higgs (2003) a decade later, argued that chairmen should\nbe distanced from day-to-day company operations.\nHowever, the downside to improved corporate governance is the simultaneous emergence of\n\u2018regulation creep\u2019 as, the UK\u2019s Combined Code (Higgs, 2003) recommends 82 provisions for\nboard adoption, which is a substantial increase of protocol to that recommended by Cadbury\n(1992). A number of commentators complain that the greater attention to governance\nprocesses has over-emphasised the \u2018comply\u2019 side of the \u2018comply and explain\u2019 duality of\ngovernance, moving to a principle of \u2018comply or breach\u2019, thus positioning corporate\ngovernance as a tick box exercise rather than a deeper analysis of managerial and corporate\npractice (Coombes and Wong, 2004). The drift to compliance, as opposed to investigation\nand understanding, has even further elevated the stature of the role of chairman. Partly to\nensure that the \u2018tick box\u2019 mentality does not emerge but also to facilitate exploration of key\nenterprise issues framed as \u201cstrategies\u201d, \u201cchange\u201d, \u201cgoals\u201d, \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d, \u201crisk\u201d,\n\u201copportunities\u201d and so on, the chairman is now viewed by an increasing number of\ncommentators as holding equal status to that of the CEO (Kakabadse et al., 2001). With such\na breadth of responsibility and influence, it is recognised that a chairman should not replicate\nthe previous excesses of CEOs but instead attain consensus amongst board members by\nfacilitating inclusive decision-making processes and drawing upon board members\u2019 wealth of\n9experience in terms of market and environment scanning and interpretation (Weick and\nRoberts, 1993). In ascertaining the nature of effective decision processes, two UK based\nstudies, consisting of 134 chairmen in the first instance and 300 in the second (Dulewicz and\nHerbert, 1999; 2004), found no evidence that chairmen or board members believed that voting\nis a healthy manifestation of board decision-making, emphasising instead the merging of\ninterests towards a \u2018collective mind\u2019 (Lonergan, 1957). Parker (1990) agreed, positioning the\nrole of chairman as that of looking outward and forward, a \u201cleader-chairman\u201d, whilst the CEO\nmanages the day-to-day affairs of the firm. Similarly, Garratt (1999: 29) names the chairman\nthe \u201cboss of the board\u201d whose role is to \u201cinduct, include and train to competence each director\nand the board as a collective whole\u201d, a view with which others concur (Roberts, 2002; Austin,\n2005). Roberts (2002) argues that the chairman is key to ensuring that boards play a\n\u2018complementary\u2019 role to the CEO in the direction and control of the company, whatever their\nparticular combination of duties and activities. In so doing, the CEO has an invaluable set of\nadditional resources to draw upon. The sensitive inter linkage between the role of chairman\nand CEO is further illustrated by the Florou (2005) eight year study concluding that a prime\nfunction of chairman is the dismissal of failing CEOs. Cognisant of the ever growing\nimportance of chairmen, the Australian Shareholders\u2019 Association (ASA, 2004) guidelines\nsuggest that the workload and the duty of the chairman are three times that of ordinary\nboardroom directors, requiring the role holder to allow for a minimum commitment of 360\nhours (or 45 working days) per year. The ASA also concluded that any individual who sits on\nmore than five boards is offering a disservice to each of the company\u2019s shareholders (ASA,\n2004; Galacho, 2004).\nOn the basis that the chairman of the board has become, and has been recognised to become,\never more critical to the sustainable future of the firm, this paper explores the nature of the\n10\nchairman\u2019s role and practice (Cutting and Kouzmin, 2004). A review of the interpretations of\nthe role, responsibilities and contribution of the chairman, contrasting UK and US practice,\nprecedes reporting the results of an international, qualitative survey of the demographic\ninfluences determining the role and practice of US, UK and Australian chairmen. Challenged\nis the assumption that the role of chairman is universally comparable. Scrutinised are certain\nconfigurational factors that are considered to provide shape to the role of chairman,\nparameters within which each incumbent determines the \u2018finer\u2019 nature of their role. The\npaper concludes that nationally determined configurational demographics influence the\nidentity and boundaries of the role of chairman, thus calling into question whether the\nposition of chairman can be considered as a universal managerialist concept.\nChairman: Role in Context\nMost pundits concur that with the ever greater demand for effective governance and\ntransparency, the quality and capabilities of the chairman are critical to the performance of the\nboard and, in turn, the enterprise (Kakabadse et al., 2001). A summary of recent studies\noutlining the characteristics of high performing chairmen is provided (Table 1).\n11\nTable 1: Chairman: Attributes of Effective Performance\nAuthor Study Type Characteristics of High Performing Chairman\nParker (1990) Qualitative study \uf0b7 Outward looking\n\uf0b7 Forward looking\nStewart (1991) Longitudinal qualitative study\nof 20 GMs and chairmen in\nthe NHS (UK)\n\uf0b7 Interdependent, complimentary \u2013\npartnership with CEO\n\uf0b7 Balancing activities among key figures\nCadbury (1992) Experiential practice (UK) \uf0b7 Leadership of the board\n\uf0b7 External face of the company (e.g.\ninvestors)\nGarratt (1999) Experimental practice \uf0b7 Boss of the board\n\uf0b7 Designee and chair of the board\u2019s\nmeetings\/activities\n\uf0b7 New board member induction\n\uf0b7 Competency development of board\nmembers\n\uf0b7 Promotes board development\nKakabadse et al.\n(2001)\n95 directors (35 in-depth,\nsemi-structured interviews and\nthree focus groups of 20)\nNEDs\/Chairmen, CEOs \u2013\nFTSE 100 (UK)\n\uf0b7 Maturity\n\uf0b7 Relational skills\n\uf0b7 High political and social competence\n\uf0b7 Meetings skills\n\uf0b7 Coaching skills\n\uf0b7 Effective management of boardroom\ndynamics\nRoberts (2002) 35 interviews with chairmen,\nCEOs and NEDs (UK)\n\uf0b7 Minimal ambition for executive power\n\uf0b7 Complimentary to CEO (i.e. supporting\nrole of executive) in:\n\u2212 Skills\n\u2212 Experience\n\u2212 Knowledge\n\u2212 Temperament\n\u2212 Business focus, or\n\u2212 Values\n\uf0b7 Chairs meetings (e.g. focusing,\nstimulating discussion, generating\nopenness, trust)\n\uf0b7 Dismissing\/appointing CEO\nIn determining the nature of the skill set of the chairman, considerable research has linked the\nperformance effectiveness of the board to the quality of boardroom dynamics (Kakabadse and\nKakabadse, 1999). The chairman\u2019s skill in managing often complex and sensitive\nrelationships, with board directors expressing differences of view on strategy whilst striving\nto attain meaningful consensus on board and enterprise wide issues, is viewed as fundamental\nto the long-term future of the firm (Cadbury, 1992; Taylor, 2001).\n12\nThe relational skills to lead through complex boardroom interactions, mindful of respecting\nand yet being assertive with critical board members such as the CEO, displaying a maturity of\ntemperament in order not to appear as threatening to other board members and executive\nmanagement and facilitating open communication, have emerged as the key elements of\neffective chairmanship (Roberts, 2002).\nHowever, despite broad consensus from Anglo-American based studies of the skill set of\nchairmen, national demographic differences have equally been identified as determining the\nnature and responsibility span of chairmen. It is common practice in the UK and Australia for\nthe role of chairman to be separated from that of CEO. The UK\u2019s Code of Best Practice,\ninitially formulated through Cadbury (1992), recommended that the functions of CEO and\nchairman of the board should be split, with the chairman being responsible for the leadership\nof the board and for acting as the external face of the company, particularly in relation to\ninvestors. Through such division of responsibilities, no one individual emerges with\nunfettered power over the firm\u2019s strategic and operational decisions (Cadbury, 1992; Higgs,\n2003). The effect of Cadbury was significant. The percentage of UK firms adopting\nseparation of roles increased from 48.4% in 1985 to 90.2% by 1995 (Hanson and Song,\n2000). By 2003, 1,689 chairman posts of 1,702 listed companies were held by executive or\nnon executive board directors but not by the CEO (Higgs, 2003). In the same year, of the\nFTSE 100 companies, only five reported joint chairman\/CEO roles whilst 24 chairmen were\nformerly the CEO of the same company (Higgs, 2003).\nThe UK\u2019s self-regulatory model of governance makes the chairman ultimately accountable for\nthe activities and personnel of the corporation, particularly as UK company law draws no\ndistinction between the responsibilities of executive and non executive directors (DTI, 2000).\n13\nSimilar to the UK Westminster model of government where the Prime Minister acts as \u2018first\namong equals\u2019, shaping both the Cabinet and Parliament, the chairman, irrespective of being\nexternally appointed or elected from within the board, occupies a similarly critically\ninfluential role within the board and across executive management. The Cadbury Code\n(Cadbury, 1992) and consequent corporate governance codes and reports, such as the Hempel\n(1998) report, emphasised that all directors are equally responsible for developing and\nimplementing the company\u2019s strategy as well as for attending to the governance of the\ncompany. Thus the motto \u201cone for all and all for one (un pour tous, tous pour un)\u201d,\ntraditionally associated with the King\u2019s Musketeers (royal guards) captured in the 1844\nFrench novel by Alexandre Dumas, is a useful analogy of statement of solidarity between the\nmembers of the board as well as between them and executive management. Supportive of the\n\u2018team bonding\u2019 theme, it was the Higgs (2003) report that emphasised the pivotal role of\nchairman in crafting the conditions for director and board effectiveness. Higgs (2003)\nrecommended that the chairman should be responsible for;\n\uf0b7 the leading of the board, ensuring its effectiveness and for setting its agenda;\n\uf0b7 ensuring the provision of accurate, timely and clear information to directors;\n\uf0b7 ensuring for transparent and relevant communication to shareholders;\n\uf0b7 arranging for the regular evaluation of the performance of the board, its committees\nand individual directors;\n\uf0b7 enhancing the contribution of non executive directors; and\n\uf0b7 ensuring for constructive relations between executive and non executive directors.\nIn order to maintain the spirit of role separation, an emerging UK based trend is to recruit the\nchairman from existing non executive positions and not migrate the CEO to the position of\nchairman (Kakabadse et al., 2006). In fact, Higgs (2003: 81) specifically suggested that the\n14\n\u201cchief executive should not go on to become chairman of the same company\u201d (Table 2). The\nHiggs (2003) view is that a chairman, independent of immediate executive concerns, is more\nlikely to provide objective opinion on proposals, be more effective in monitoring decisions\nand be more likely to promote shareholder interests (Weir and Laing, 2001). Thus, the critical\nand central nature of the role of chairman in the UK is considered as one of great prestige and\nthe pinnacle of a successful career, likely facilitating access to government commissions, to\nboards of charities or other \u2018worthy\u2019 social entities. Remuneration, however, is often only\n10% to 20% of that of the CEO (Coombes and Wong, 2004). That being said, the average\nUK non executive chairman\u2019s pay varies considerably. A survey of 33 boards by Pass (2004)\nfound that the spread of non executive chairmen remuneration varied between \u00a3125,000 in\nNorthern Foods Ltd. to \u00a3480,000 at Vodafone, with the average for internationally renowned\ncompanies emerging at \u00a3222,000.\nEmphasised is the attention that needs to be given to maintaining a positive and supportive\nrelationship between that of chairman and CEO (Westphal, 1998; Meyer, 2000; Kakabadse et\nal., 2001). Recognising that the role and contribution of chairman varies according to each\ncorporate context, UK based studies (Stewart, 1991; Pettigrew, 1992; Kakabadse et al., 2001;\nRoberts, 2002) have concluded that the relationship between the chairman and CEO is critical\nto the sustainable future of the firm, irrelevant of the diversity and magnitude of challenges\nthey both, and the organisation, face. Even studies of 40 years ago (Hodgson et al., 1965)\nobserved the \u2018complementarity of functions\u2019 between chairman and CEO, with Stewart\n(1991) stating that the chairman role and executive director\u2019s role within the context of the\nUK\u2019s health services, are mutually inter-dependent. Kakabadse et al. (2006), in their recent\nstudy of CEO\/chair interrelations, reveal that the chair\/CEO complementarity resembles a\n15\n\u2018generative dance\u2019 of constant attention to changes of mood and circumstance and, above all,\nthe observable display of trust and respect for the other.\nDespite the few studies of chairmen conducted in Australia, emerging evidence indicates\ncomparability with UK practice, where chairman and CEO roles are separate with both\nreporting to boards predominantly consisting of non executive directors (Nicholson and Kiel,\n2004; Table 2). The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) requires that\nchairman\/CEO roles should be separated but in the few circumstances where the two are\ncombined, an independent non executive director be appointed as the deputy chairman, who\nwould act as the voice of independent reason (Bosch, 1995). For Australian boards, the\nchairman is recognised as the lead director determining the board agenda, undertaking public\nrelations responsibilities and ensuring that board meetings run smoothly (Nicholson and Kiel,\n2004). The chairman is also identified as the driving force behind board evaluation,\nfacilitating the development of board directors, executive management and particularly that of\nthe CEO (Nicholson and Kiel, 2004).\nIn contrast, to both the UK and Australia, role separation is not broadly observed in the USA\nwhereby the roles of CEO, president and chairman are all one for the majority of the 6,703\npublicly listed US companies whose stock is actively traded on the New York Stock\nExchange (Wilshire Mutual Funds, 2005). Approximately 20% of the Standard and Poor 500\ncompanies have separated the role of chairman and CEO\/president (Ward, 1996; Coombes\nand Wong, 2004; Table 2). Within the American system, ultimate power lies with the role of\npresident\/chairman\/CEO, whilst all other corporate actors fundamentally exist to assist the\nchairman\/CEO\/president to realise his\/her goals and vision (Cutting and Kouzmin, 1998).\nThus it is the CEO\/president\/chair who sets the agenda and determines the quantity, quality\n16\nand timing of information for the board (Monk and Minow, 2004). Legal, financial\naccountability and probity lie with the combined role of chair\/CEO and CFO (Ward, 1996;\nTable 2).\nTable 2: National Variance of Governance\nContext UK USA Australia\nGovernance practice Self regulatory (\u2018comply\nor explain\u2019 approach)\nLegislation driven Self regulation but strictly\nconforming to national\nregulatory authorities\n(Australian Securities and\nInvestments Commission;\nSecurities and Exchange\nCommission)\nLegal responsibility \u2018Collective\nresponsibility\u2019 \u2013 \u2018no\ndifference\u2019 between\nexecutive and non\nexecutive directors\n(shared liability)\nChairman\/CEO and\nCFO (chief financial\nofficer) carry legal\nresponsibilities \u2013\ncertification of financial\nreports under Sarbanes-\nOxley (2002)\nChair has ultimate\naccountability\nRole separation Clear preference for\nseparation (92% of UK\u2019s\n1,702 listed companies)\nRole duality.

The US leadership literature paints a picture of\n17\npreference to be led by a visible, dominant and powerful \u2018supreme commander\u2019, or hero\nfigure, representing American values and reflecting a personalised and idiosyncratic influence\non the board of the US corporation (Garratt, 2003; Monk and Minow, 2004). Further, US\nexecutive pay for top managerial positions is considerably higher than that of their\ncounterparts abroad, reflecting the American belief that successful people should display their\naccomplishment through material gain (Monk and Minow, 2004: 341).\nHowever, there has been a reaction to the \u2018one-man\u2019 dominance of the American corporation.\nCertain US States, such as Pennsylvania and Connecticut, have limited the singular control of\nthe CEO\/chair\/president by adopting corporate laws similar to Germany, Japan and Canada\nwhich recognise, to varying extent, the director\u2019s duty is to take into account non-shareholder\ncorporate stakeholders. However, more than 50% of US publicly listed companies and more\nthan 60% of the Fortune 500 companies are registered under a Delaware statute that holds that\ndirectors are required to own an \u201cunyielding\u201d duty to the corporation and its shareholders and,\nby implication, few others (Greenfield, 2004: 105).\nIn fact, the role duality of chairman\/CEO\/president reflects the political governance model of\nthe American President, who can choose his Cabinet from non elected members and where\nCabinet members basically serve at the President\u2019s favour, though they are required to be\nratified by the Congress (similar to directors being ratified by a body of shareholders).\nDespite the US influence across the globe, the governance model of role duality is under\nattack. Research and deliberation has shown that;\n\uf0b7 amongst the six principal symptoms for corporate collapse highlighted by Argenti\n(1976), the \u2018one man rule\u2019 or combined chairman\/CEO\/president role, tops the list;\n18\nothers being non participative boards, unbalanced management top teams, lack of\nmanagement depth and weak finance functions;\n\uf0b7 corporate scandals and cases of executive folly are on the increase, with the\nchairman\/CEO\/president identified as being at the centre of so-called wrongdoing\n(Beasley et al., 1999; Charan and Useem, 2002);\n\uf0b7 pressure from the Blue Ribbon Committee (Debman, 2002) continues for the dividing\nof the chairman\/CEO role into two positions. Proposed is that the role of non\nexecutive chair be given to an independent, non executive director having the\nauthority to determine both the board agenda and the quality and flow of information\nto the board; and\n\uf0b7 scholars have repeatedly argued that role duality creates a structural impediment to the\ntransparency and independence of non executive (external) directors (Pearce and\nZahra, 1991; Daily and Dalton, 1994; Beasley, 1996; Slatter and Lovett, 1999; Monk\nand Minow, 2004).\nIn response to further corporate scandal, regulatory adjustment was introduced in the form of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley (2002), which avoided tackling the issue of role duality (Andert, 2005)\nbut instead Sarbanes-Oxley (2002) introduced legal culpability for the falsification of\ninformation by senior corporate officers. Also accentuated under Sarbanes-Oxley was the\nimportance of the nominations committee to counter balance the power of the\nchairperson\/CEO.\nPossibly due to role duality but also due to its limited remunerative potential, chairmanship in\nthe USA holds a less prestigious status than that of the CEO (Coombes and Wong, 2004).\nThe less demanding, relatively poorly paid role of part-time chairman is identified as less\n19\nappealing to the highly successful US executive, even on their retirement, in comparison to\ntheir full-time managerial role (Coombes and Wong, 2004). More common is for top US\nexecutives to accept public-service responsibilities on or close to their retirement, thus further\nlimiting the motivation to separate the roles and attract candidates for chairman who are\nactive, full-time or part-time executive professionals (Coombes and Wong, 2004).\nConscious of the critique of role duality, a number of empirical studies have sought to test the\neffect of role combination against financial and non financial performance indicators. The\nemerging picture, however, is inconclusive (Daily and Dalton, 1997; Dalton et al., 1998).\nCertain studies highlight that powerful, independently minded boards are more progressive\nand are associated with superior financial performance than boards dominated by the one\nchairman\/CEO\/president (Pearce and Zahra, 1991). Other studies (Dalton et al., 2003;\nKakabadse and Kakabadse, 2004) conclude that board configuration is no panacea for board\neffectiveness. Further, recent scandals have revealed that companies with separate and\ncombined roles have failed to be diligent with their oversight function (Kakabadse et al.,\n2006). On balance, however, Coombes and Wong (2004) consider the argument for\nseparating the roles of CEO and chairman as more persuasive. Through role separation,\nboards are given a structural basis for acting independently and for nurturing an environment\nwhich will allow the chairman and other board members to challenge the CEO without fear of\ngiving (or attracting) offence (Coombes and Wong, 2004).\nYet despite recent research, a paucity of insight of the consequences of continuing with the\nchairman\/CEO role duality, particularly in terms of corporate performance and sustainability,\nexists (Stewart, 1991). Most of the studies pursued have been quantitative in nature, extracted\nfrom data sets rather than from observation and interaction with in-situ boardroom directors,\n20\nwith the results being \u201cbound to be equivocal because the effectiveness of a particular board\ndepends not only on composition and structure but also on the will and skill of individual\nboard members and the interpersonal and group processes through which their energies are\ncombined\u201d (Roberts, 2002: 496).\nIrrespective of the need for further knowledge, increased pressure from shareholders in the\nwake of public scandal has pressured US boards to introduce the role of \u2018lead director\u2019 to act\nas the go-between between the chairman\/CEO\/president and the other board directors, to\nconsult with the chairman\/CEO\/president on the drafting of the board agenda, to provide\nindependent challenge, to consult with the chairman\/CEO\/president on the selection of the\nboard committee members and sub-committee chairpersons, to ensure for adequacy of\ninformation directors receive and to directly contribute to improving the effectiveness of\nboard meetings. Recent trends indicate that approximately 30% of the largest US enterprises\nnow have a lead director on their board (Coombes and Wong, 2004). Defenders of role\nduality argue that the \u2018lead director\u2019 model, combined with other measures such as requiring\nboards to have a majority of independent directors and that they hold meetings without the\npresence of management, obviates the need for the separation of roles (Coombes and Wong,\n2004).\nThe Study\nConscious of the growing importance of the role of chairman in the UK and Australia and of\nthe emerging pressures to \u2018better\u2019 balance US boards, a comparative, international study of\nthe national configurational demographics that could affect the role identity, performance and\ncontribution of the chairman, was undertaken. As the study was exploratory in nature, a\n21\nqualitative methodology was adopted through in-depth interviews and workshop exploratory\nsessions with 103 chairmen of UK, US and Australian listed companies (Table 3).\nTable 3: Data Source\nBoardroom Role UK\n(FTSE 150)\nUSA\n(S & P 500)\nAustralia\n(ASX 50)\nChairman 35 - 33\nCEO\/chairman - 35 -\nMany of the study participants held more than one board role such as being chairman of one\nboard, CEO to another organisation or non executive director (NED) and\/or lead independent\ndirector (LID) of an additional board. Considering that the purpose of the interview was to\nunderstand the chairman\u2019s role and contribution from the role incumbent\u2019s perspective, \u201cthe\nvalidity, mindfulness and insights generated \u2026 have more to do with the information-richness\nof the cases selected and the observational\/analytical capabilities of the researcher than with\nthe sample size\u201d (Patton, 2002: 185).\nIn order to gain consistency across interviews, the framework of role theory (Katz and Kahn,\n1966) was adopted in order to understand each incumbent\u2019s role related expectations, their\ninteractions with and degree of influence over other board members and wider stakeholders\nand how such experiences helped them shape their board role. The interviews ranged from\none to two hours, the majority conducted in-situ, namely the study respondent\u2019s work place.\nA series of common but open-ended themes were pursued allowing each respondent to\nuniquely position their line of response. The approach allowed for commonality of response\nacross interviews whilst encouraging expansion into issues each interviewee considered\nimportant. Interviews were carried out throughout 2005 and the first half of 2006. The\nresearchers adopted the philosophy of iterative development, devoting time after each\n22\ninterview to discuss its content and identify emergent critical themes to be explored in future\nencounters (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). Interviews were fully transcribed and additionally\nindependently read with the objective of identifying common themes across the narratives\n(Riessman, 1993).\nStudy Findings\nNine demographic determinants were identified as effecting the discharge of the role and\nresponsibilities of chairman across the three samples, namely role boundary, executive or non\nexecutive status, accountability spread, the driving of the vision, the recruitment of chairmen,\ngeographic domicile, counter balancing influence to that of the chairman, tenure and\ngovernance application (Table 4).\nAll participants concurred that the role of chairman is of critical importance to board and\nenterprise effectiveness, particularly so with the UK and Australian respondents. US\nrespondents agreed, but all but one declared themselves in support of role duality,\nemphasising their capacity to apply different skills and capabilities when acting as CEO as\nopposed to being chairman of the board.\n23\nTable 4: Role of Chairman: Demographic Identity Determinants\nDemographics UK USA Australia\nRole boundary Chairman runs board;\nCEO leads the\nenterprise\nCEO\/chair leads the\nenterprise and the board\nChairman role delineation\njointly determined with\nCEO\/MD\nStatus: executive or non\nexecutive\nLittle difference in\npractice\nExecutive dominant Extensive difference\nAccountability Chairman accountable\nfor board performance\nCEO\/chairman\naccountable for board and\nbusiness performance\nChairman accountable for\nboard and business\nperformance\nVision ownership Chairman: vision\npassive\nCEO\/chairman: vision\nactive \u2013 if role split, then\npassive\nChairman: vision active\nRecruitment International National National\nDomicile Not relevant Not relevant if role is\nsplit, otherwise\nCEO\/chairman resides in\nthe same city as\nheadquarters\nChair resides in same city\nas headquarters\nCounter balancing role Senior independent\ndirector (SID)\nLead independent director\n(LID)\nDeputy chairman (n.b.\nlittle need for the counter\nbalance)\nTenure More effective longer\nin role (12 to 15 years)\nMore effective longer in\nrole (8 to 10 years)\nMore effective longer in\nrole (12 to 15 years)\nGovernance application Voluntary: increasingly\ncompliant\nLegislative: compliant Voluntary: compliant\nRole Boundary\nThe role of chairman was initially reported as \u2018uniquely\u2019 enacted by each incumbent and\nadapted to each boardroom context. Board context was reported as influenced by;\n\uf0b7 the board\u2019s history and culture;\n\uf0b7 the norms of conduct within the enterprise;\n\uf0b7 the pattern of selection to the job;\n\uf0b7 the nature of socialisation with board colleagues;\n\uf0b7 the degree to which each board member\u2019s expectations of their role was realised (or\nnot);\n\uf0b7 the quality of dialogue on the board;\n\uf0b7 the nature of board power based relations; and\n24\n\uf0b7 external conditions such as the influence of regulators, legislation, codes of practice,\nstock exchange conditions and the demands of institutional investors.\nThus, the chairman\u2019s contribution was described as individually and idiosyncratically enacted\nfrom board to board and from country to country.\n\u201cLook, at the end of the day I decide how I wish to run my board.\u201d\nUK Chairman, Utilities Company\n\u201cMore legislation; more demands, greater responsibilities but as chairman, it is up\nto me to have the board I want and the chief executive that I feel is right for the\nbusiness.\u201d\nAustralian Chairman, Banking Organisation\n\u201cYes, Sarbanes-Oxley has had a substantial effect; for a start it\u2019s expensive but I\nmade it happen. But irrespective of all that, I am the chairman I want to be. My\ngreatest concern is to make sure that I carry the board with me! Being chairman\nand CEO, to have your board go against you causes real problems.\u201d\nUSA Chairman\/CEO\/President, Insurance Company\nDespite the distinctly personal and idiosyncratic approach toward chairmanship, through\nprobing, an underlying pattern was determined according to role delineation. UK chairmen\nmore reported themselves as focusing on board affairs, leaving the CEO to run the enterprise.\nIntervention would only arise if it became evident that the CEO was seen to be \u2018performing\npoorly\u2019.\n25\nIn contrast, US chairmen determined the nature of the separation of activities allocated to the\nrole of CEO and chair. Few reported that they discussed the allocation and manner of role\ndivision with their board members. However, a minority stated that they made time for board\nmembers to examine issues without the presence of any executive manager, including that of\nthemselves, when in the role of CEO. Therefore, either at the end of, or at the beginning of,\nboard meetings, non executive and independent directors were allocated time on their own to\ndiscuss pertinent issues. In effect, for a minority of cases, the chairman\/CEO left the room for\nthe other board members to continue debate.\nAustralian chairmen emerged as more dominant than their UK counterparts with the majority\nreporting that they, together with their CEO or in many cases the managing director (MD),\njointly determined the nature of role delineation.\nExecutive\/Non Executive Status\nAs much driven by a desire to have the CEO as the pivotal point of the enterprise and to be\nsupportive of management, UK chairmen reported little difference in the role of executive and\nnon executive chairman. The respondents indicated that the real difference was between\nbeing a part-time or full-time chairman. All of the executive chairmen in the sample\nemphasised the limited number of executive functions for which they were accountable (if\nany). Whether executive or non executive, the principal involvement remained with attending\nto the duties of board. Hence, the real difference was the level of involvement in the affairs of\nthe board and that of the firm. Full-time chairmen reported themselves as more involved in\nthe day to day affairs of the firm, whereas part-time chairmen reported greater reliance on the\n26\nquality of relationship and level of trust with their CEO whilst having no executive functions\nreporting to them.\n\u201cThere is little difference between an executive and non executive chairman. The\nreal difference is between being full-time and part-time. At the end of the day, the\nbusiness reports to the CEO who reports to me. He runs the business. I look after\nthe board and if necessary we (chair and board) sack the CEO and appoint the\nsuccessor.\u201d\nUK Chairman, Transport Company\nIn terms of executive and non executive identity, the contrast between UK and Australian\nchairmen was substantial. A greater number of Australian respondents reported themselves as\nholding executive chairman responsibilities, in many cases subsuming the role of CEO. The\nrange of executive responsibilities adopted by Australian chairmen was greater than that of\ntheir UK counterparts. A greater number of executive functions were identified in interview\nas directly reporting to the Australian chairman. As a result, the role of CEO in Australian\ncompanies was described as more akin to that of a managing director (MD) or even that of\nchief operating officer (COO), but termed MD.\n\u201cThere is a hell of a difference between being executive and non executive\nchairman. I am an executive chairman and quite a few of the key functions report\nto me. I have an MD not a CEO who, if I am honest, is more of a COO (chief\noperating officer). Most Australians do not understand this quaint British thing of\n\u2018exec and non exec\u2019 chairs being more or less the same thing.\u201d\nAustralian Chairman, International Food Company\n27\nIn the USA, the executive\/non executive distinction did not emerge as a consideration due to\nrole duality. What was reported as critical was being mindful of the requirements of\nSarbanes-Oxley, that responsibility particularly falling on the shoulders of the CEO and chief\nfinancial officer (CFO). Attention to due process and ensuring for governance transparency\nwas viewed as fundamental, although a sizeable proportion of US respondents emerged as\ncritical of Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\u201cI think Sarbanes-Oxley was an over reaction and it will take some time for the\ndust to settle. As far as my company is concerned, we are a typical board where\nchairman, president and CEO are all one guy - me - who has to stand before a\nrange of 14 external directors and basically explain how he takes sole\nresponsibility as the company\u2019s decision maker. With my future always on the line,\nI will tell you what I will do as chairman of the board and I don\u2019t need Sarbanes-\nOxley to tell me that.\u201d\nChairman, US Defence Company\nAccountability Spread\nThe executive\/non executive orientation to the role of chairman reflected in the nature and\nspread of accountabilities across the three samples. UK respondents reported that the\nchairman is held accountable for the board, its decisions, activities and performance. In\ncontrast, the chairman\/CEO of US companies and the chairman of Australian companies\nreported themselves as being held accountable for both board and firm performance, thus\nhaving, for some, a number of executive functions reporting to them.\n28\nVision\nDue to the accountability spread of the role of chairman, further differences emerged across\nthe three sample groups. In terms of identifying and promoting a vision for the future of the\nfirm, British chairmen reported their role as positioning the board to debate, challenge and\n\u2018sign off\u2019 on the vision of the CEO and his\/her management team. The \u2018more passive\u2019 UK\nchairman was contrasted by the \u2018more proactive\u2019 Australian chairman who reported distinct\ninvolvement in, and for some outright determination of, the vision of the company. The\nmajority of Australian chairmen reported themselves as the \u2018stewards\u2019 of the vision of the\nenterprise.\n\u201cI, together with the management, set the parameters for the vision and drive that\nprocess through. I, like so many other Australian chairmen, act as the long-term\nanchor for the company. Our top positions (CEO\/MD) are often filled from outside\nAustralia, mainly Americans, and whether British or American, most of our CEOs\nand MDs leave after three to five years. Therefore, I need to be the one to set the\nvision. As it is, I am the one that is here for the long-term.\u201d\nAustralian Chairman, Australian Manufacturing\n\u201cThe CEO with his management team determines the vision and I and the board do\nthe \u2018reality check\u2019. If that does not survive board debate, back it goes for the CEO\nand the team to revise. However from my experience that is rare as we would have\nbeen discussing (CEO\/chair with board) the shape of the vision in any case.\u201d\nUK Chairman, Energy Company\n29\nThe US respondents confirmed that the responsibility for the determination and the driving\nforward of the vision was theirs. However, a number raised the issue of ownership and\ndependency. Being the person shaping the strategic profile of the enterprise, it is all too easy\nfor others to look for direction from the chair\/CEO, thus becoming dependent and not offering\nconstructive challenge. Additionally, lack of meaningful involvement from either the\nmanagement team or the board could induce little ownership for the vision that is generated.\nThus, most respondents referred to the delicate balance of \u2018acting\u2019 as CEO whilst in the role\nof CEO and adopting a different style as chairman of the board.\n\u201cIt is difficult being both CEO and board chairman, especially when under\npressure or when fatigued. Although I try, and try hard, I do not always become\nmore conciliatory as chairman of the board.\u201d\nUS Chair\/CEO\/President, International Commodities Company\nRecruitment\nNot only the determination of the vision but also the practice of recruiting the chairman, was\nidentified as different across the three groups. Particularly in Australia, the study participants\nemphasised that stringent effort was made to appoint \u2018home grown talent\u2019 in order to ensure\nfor long-term stability. As the Australian chairman of the manufacturing company quoted\nabove states, a common perception is that \u2018better\u2019 senior management talent is located off\nshore. Australian chairmen highlighted that the average period of tenure for, particularly\nAmerican, but also British senior managers, was three to five years. Thus, Australian\nchairmen saw themselves as \u2018the anchor\u2019 providing sustainability.\n30\n\u201cIt is to do with taxation with the US executives we bring over. In America, with an\nabsence of five years, all your assets are taxed globally. So with the Americans,\nthey either become Australian citizens or go back and, guess what, back they go. I\nam the anchor. I keep the company together over the long-term. I have to be\nAustralian.\u201d\nAustralian Chairman, Services Company\nFor different reasons, a similar practice was reported by US respondents. Role duality was\nhighlighted as requiring a \u2018hands on\u2019 approach to both the management of the enterprise and\nthe leadership of the board. In terms of skill set, preference was given to executive track\nrecord, executive experience and managerial skills over boardroom capability. Consequently,\nmost US chairmen reported distinctly favouring US centric executives who have the\nunderstanding, insight and sector background relevant to US based home markets.\n\u201cUnderstanding the sector and knowing the US market is vital.\u201d\nUS Chairman, IT Company\nIt was the British chairmen who reported a broader, international reach in terms of recruitment\npractice. Proximity to Europe and to the USA and the drive for penetration of non home\nbased markets was seen to require the firm\u2019s top executives to display international skill and\nexperience. Therefore, for both CEO and chair roles, the search parameters were broad\nencompassing track record, breadth of experience, international exposure, sectoral knowledge\nand particularly personal leadership capability. It was the British who more emphasised the\n31\nleadership capacity of the individual as against other factors such as knowledge of home\nmarkets.\n\u201cBeing British means being international. Our reach is principally northern\nhemisphere. Also we are probably one of the most open markets in the world.\nThat means the search for talent has no boundaries.\u201d\nUK Chairman, Investment Company\nDomicile\nMindful of their executive accountabilities and consequently being needful to attend to\noperational details, Australian chairmen reported that it was common practice for the chair to\nreside in the same city as the headquarters of the company. For the majority of US firms, the\nCEO element of the dual role determined that the chairman remained geographically close to\nthe headquarters of the firm.\nAs far as British chairmen were concerned, the domicile of the chairmen was not considered a\nconcern. A substantial number of British respondents reported being chairmen of British, US\nand Continental European companies. Travelling considerable distances to board meetings\nand accompanying the CEO on international tours on behalf of the firm, was reported as \u2018part\nand parcel of the job\u2019.\nCounter Balancing Role\n32\nDifferences of substance not only concerned the range of activities and responsibilities of the\nrole of chairman but also of the counter balancing influence to the chairman of the board.\nPartly driven by fear of further scandal but also by the realisation that the central role of\nchairman allows for potential domination of the board, all three sample groups reported an\nadditional role being available for providing a counter balancing influence to that of the\nchairman. The role of senior independent director (SID) on UK boards is paralleled by an\nequally deliberately crafted role on US boards, that of lead independent director (LID). No\nspecifically determined role such as that of SID or LID was reported as designed for\nAustralian boards. Through default, the single source of counter argument to the Australian\nchairman was expected from the deputy chairman. However, not all Australian boards\nreported they constituted the role of deputy chairman, some viewing the position as\nunnecessary and others declaring already robust debate on the board.\nThe emerging opinion across the three sample groups was that the role of \u2018independent\u2019\ndirector had only recently been introduced and, as such, it was too early to ascertain the\neffectiveness of the SIDs or LIDs. Yet despite recent introduction, certain chairmen reported\nthe role of independent director as offering a valuable contribution to board dynamics and\nboard functioning. Emphasised was the importance of selecting the \u2018right\u2019 candidate to the\njob. Particular chairmen described the difficulties of balancing the tension of leading the\nboard and being attentive to the management of the firm, whilst nurturing a cohesive but\nchallenging working environment. Unable to work on \u2018two fronts\u2019, the value of the\nindependent director was described as \u2018evident\u2019.\nWhether in favour of the independent director concept or not, the need for challenge within\nthe boardroom was acknowledged. Most recognised the potential for \u2018group think\u2019 both on\n33\nboards and on the top team. Thus, the contribution of the lead\/independent director was\nconsidered as influenced by cultural characteristics, whether of a national nature or more\nspecifically the culture of a particular board. British respondents considered that the views\nand positions adapted by the CEO and chairman were overtly challenged within the\nboardroom or within informal cliques prior to board meetings, which acted as preparation for\nan organised confrontation at the formal meeting. In the words of one UK chairman, \u201cBritish\nNEDs offer quiet defiance.\u201d\n\u201cYes, there have been quite a few occasions when I and others should have spoken\nup. But after a while something does come out, either from behind the scenes or\nupfront. You see, the reason we don\u2019t need SIDs is that in Britain, a NED is there\nto challenge at the committee meetings as well as on the main board. Sometimes a\nbit untidily, but challenge does come. That\u2019s your job, if not, resign.\u201d\nUK NED, Energy Company\nThe predominant view expressed by US NED\/independent directors (not so much US\nchairmen) was that of inhibition at board meetings. Challenging the chairman\/CEO was\nreported as uncomfortable and unwelcome. A substantial proportion of US NED\/independent\ndirector respondents reported that no matter how appropriate or timely the challenge, the level\nof discomfort experienced by the other board members created \u2018an atmosphere\u2019 inhibitive of\nfurther discussion. Thus, most US board directors reported that their skills and experience\nwere considerably under utilised. Only \u2018favoured\u2019 directors were \u2018offered\u2019 sufficient airtime\nto express their views.\n34\n\u201cYou need to be someone famous to get listened to on this board. It\u2019s all down to\nthe personality of the president\/CEO\/chair.\u201d\nUS Independent Director, Pharmaceutical Company\nThe reported experience of the Australian NED was that of \u2018rugged conformism\u2019.\nEmphasised was the importance of teamwork and, as board, working together as a cohesive\ngroup. However, further exploration highlighted an unwillingness by individual board\nmembers to offer contrary opinion to the group\u2019s (board directors) shared mindset. In fact,\none Australian NED linked teamwork with conformism. She made her views public by\nsuggesting to the Australian Institute of Company Directors (AICD) that they cease,\n\u201cteaching teamwork on boards and instead emphasise that boards are representative forums\nwhere criticism and comment concerning the future of the firm should be made whilst\nmaintaining commitment to the board and the company\u2019s vision.\u201d This female board director\nwas seen as outspoken by her peers. A minority of Australian respondents agreed with her\nequating teamwork on boards with \u2018group think\u2019 which in their opinion was symptomatic of\n\u2018no desire\u2019 to change. However, the majority held the opposite view, linking board cohesion\nwith effective team relations.\n\u201cWe are all about teamwork and we have a really good team on this board. In fact,\nmy number one criteria for a new board member is will they fit into this team?\u201d\nAustralian Chairman, Securities Company, making a public presentation to\nchairmen and non executive board members.\nTenure\n35\nDespite differences concerning the style and contribution of NEDs and independent directors\nand executive and non executive chairmen (whether individually, board or nationally\ndetermined), unanimity of opinion emerged across the three groups concerning the effect of\none demographic factor on chair and board performance, namely tenure. Those chairmen and\nboard members who considered themselves, and, in turn, were also considered by their board\ncolleagues, as holding \u2018deep\u2019 insight concerning the value advantage of the firm, its strengths\nand weaknesses and why the firm was differentiated against competitors (or not), had been\ninvolved with the affairs of the company and its board for a considerable period of time.\nFurther, UK and Australian companies which consistently exhibited higher than expected\nlevels of performance and whose chairmen and NEDs reported their boards as high\nperforming, attributed such continued success to being in role for between 12 to 15 years. US\nchairmen and board members considered length of tenure equally necessary to make a\nconsistent difference to the performance of the board and the firm. US respondents quoted\neight to ten years as the necessary period to make a significant impact on the board of US\ncompanies.\n\u201cDo you know how long the chairman and I have worked together? Well, so far,\n11 years and we and the board and the business are simply getting better and\nbetter.\u201d (A point of view confirmed by the chairman and an NED of the same\nboard).\nUK CEO, Tobacco Company\nCertain respondents admitted that they broke \u201cevery governance rule in the book\u201d (US\nchairman) concerning role related tenure. For UK board members, time was considered as\nimportant in order to evolve an intimacy of relationship with executive management. UK\n36\nchairmen encouraged the forming, and NEDs in particular reported being encouraged to form,\n\u2018buddying\u2019 type relationships with senior and functionally specialist managers in the company\nin areas as health and safety, the environment, corporate reputation, supply chain, etc.\nBuddying emerged as less popular with US and Australian chairmen. However, all the\nrespondents across the three sample groups strongly emphasised that the longer board\nmembers worked together, the more meaningful their relationships became and the greater\ntheir understanding of the organisation and its strength, weaknesses and idiosyncrasies, the\ngreater the opportunity for the chairman and CEO to evolve a shared mindset concerning the\nvision for the future of the organisation. By being together longer, success bred success. The\nmore successful the business, the more effectively rated was the board by its members and by\nfull-time management. Further, a longer term developed intimacy of relationship was\nconsidered as enhancing of robustness of conversation. Many described the assertive, and at\ntimes uncompromising, conversations that took place where pertinent issues were raised but\nin such a manner that the relationships were maintained as \u2018professional and workable\u2019.\n\u201cI almost enjoy having broken the governance rules. Me and the MD have known\neach other for ages. We get on well. We understand each other. The relationship\nis now more open than ever and, in turn, so are the board and the management. It\nis crazy to get people to leave when they have just really got to know each other\nand their job.\u201d\nAustralian Executive Chairman, Food Products Company\nAcross the three groups, it was considered the chairman\u2019s responsibility to nurture a culture\nwhich held as central the dynamic of \u2018speak your mind whilst being mindful of others\u2019.\nDespite recognising length of tenure as advantageous, US chairmen particularly discouraged\n37\nboard members forming a deeper relationship with the managers of the firm. Conscious of\nSarbanes-Oxley and \u2018being seen to corrupt\u2019 the independence of board members, US\nchairmen admitted their setting limits to interaction between the professional management\nand the board.\n\u201cI try really hard to be chairman of the board and then separately CEO of the\ncompany, even though I hold both positions. On the board, I make it my job for all\nto say anything they want and one way I do that is to visit, at least once a year,\neach of the independent\/non executive directors on their home turf and listen to\nwhat they say. They feel better, I feel better. Overtime, we have developed a\nhealthy respect for each other and most of all, an open style. Making the effort to\nsee them and time spent together have been invaluable to making this board work\nwell.\u201d\nUS Chairman\/CEO\/President, Insurance Company\n\u201cI know the board would really like to get to know our managers better but with the\ncurrent climate on governance, audit and regulation as it is, I thought it best to\nkeep the two separate.\u201d\nUS Chairman\/CEO\/President, Healthcare Company\nGovernance Pursuit\nIrrespective of the source of governance imperative, such as legislation, voluntary codes,\nstock exchange listing requirements, the topic of governance induced two principal responses\nfrom the study respondents, \u201cdoing it in any case but not making a big deal of it\u201d, and \u201cwhat\n38\nan unproductive use of time but doing it in any case\u201d. \u2018It\u2019 refers to governance application in\nterms of the adoption of particular processes, disciplines and protocols. Those chairmen and\nNED\/independent directors who viewed their board and company as high performing (a\nperspective also supported by relevant others), remarked that recommended or obligatory\ngovernance principles were already being proactively applied \u2013 so nothing new! The push, at\na national level, to transparently adopt particular disciplines of governance was already\n\u2018underway\u2019 in the company, thus emphasising the pursuit of best practice. However, most\ncomplained of the cost of adopting latest governance disciplines to the letter of the \u2018law\u2019.\nFor the remainder, who were the majority, governance was viewed as an expensive irritant\nthat would only introduce minimal improvement to the \u2018true\u2019 governance challenges the\ncompany faced. Many chairmen and NEDs in this group admitted that governance (or the\nlack of it) was not the problem. What was, was poor leadership and as a consequence,\ndysfunctional dynamics at board level and top team level. Those who admitted to\ndysfunctionality of both leadership and board and management relationships also admitted\nthat both board members and the senior managers of the firm were fully aware of such\nconcerns, as they were of their effect on the board and the firm as a whole. Many confirmed\nthat the level of dysfunctionality, despite all other urges to act, created such discomfort that\nboard members and even senior managers became \u2018paralysed\u2019. The situation described was\nof \u201cknowing what to do, knowing what would happen if no action took place and still doing\nnothing.\u201d (US Independent Director).\n\u201cThe relationship between the CEO and chair is bad and has been for sometime.\nYou tell me how Higgs or any other code is going to sort out two emotional egoists\n(chairman and CEO) who want their own way, frighten everybody, but in their own\n39\nway are brilliant but not when they are together. They are progressively damaging\nthe company but nothing is visible on any one day. Never mind governance, we\nneed a good SID and that is the last thing we are going to get whilst these two are\naround.\u201d\nUK NED, Energy Company\nMany of the respondents raised the question, \u201cso how will governance sort out a problem of\nleadership?\u201d Certain US respondents considered Sarbanes-Oxley to be a negative influence\non board functioning. Certain admitted to a tick box mentality being even more encouraged\nand driving corrupt practice ever more underground due to the fact that governance\nprocedures were adhered to but no real changes were forthcoming. Due to having to visibly\nact, the suspicion of wrongdoing would not be raised, with each board member justifiably\nclaiming that they were not in possession of evidence for further enquiry at the time of\ngovernance audit.\n\u201cThings are bad here. We just don\u2019t say what we should. On top of that,\nSarbanes-Oxley is being applied and nothing is really going to happen. In fact,\none of the board members said something to me the other day and I said \u2013 can you\nprove it? - if not, I don\u2019t want to know. I know that is not the right attitude but I\nhave my reputation to protect. I am not unusual and for so many of us we\nrecognise Sarbanes-Oxley is going to drive corruption even more underground. It\nwill take years to dig out. Bad leadership is not solved by governance regulation.\nYou need an equally strong leader to challenge the status quo.\u201d\nUS Independent Director, Property Company\n40\nConclusion\nThe breadth of discretion available to each incumbent to determine the nature of the role of\nchairman emerged from this study as extensive. In fact, the researchers involved admitted to\ninitially finding it difficult to ascertain common themes across interviews. For them, the early\nstages of the research was experienced as tracking the idiosyncratic nature of each chairman.\nAdditional to its breadth of scope and irrespective of the level of remuneration, the role of\nchairman is confirmed as influential and powerful in shaping the board, directly (or indirectly)\ndetermining the strategy of the firm and in nurturing a more proactive and enabling or\ndysfunctional \u2018culture\u2019 within the enterprise.\nIt was not until the study took on an international dimension that it became clear that\nindividual board and firm context, in themselves, are not sufficiently influential demographics\nto determine chairman role, configuration and behaviour. At the national level, demographic\ndeterminates significantly emerged as effecting the role boundaries and orientation of\nchairmen. Geographic particulars, such as knowledge of home markets, ex patriot\nrecruitment, the nature of governance stipulation (voluntary or legislative), role separation or\nduality and preference for executive on non executive status, significantly affected board\ndynamics, the nature of the chairman\/CEO relationship and ultimately the effectiveness of the\nboard and the firm.\nAdditional to the particulars of practice within countries, the influence of \u2018the leader\u2019, namely\nthe individual, irrespective of the role held was recognised as the ultimate driving force of the\nfirm. Whoever that leader is, still the leader was reported as the critical factor in determining\nfirm success. Irrespective of governance practice and role separation or duality, one person\n41\nwas seen to determine the success or failure of the enterprise. Those considered to have\npositive effect displayed a range of styles and approaches, best suited to the business\nchallenges facing the company. Those who consistently fostered dysfunctionality had one\nstyle \u2013 my way only \u2013 and one feature of personality \u2013 my way only! The study results\nhighlight that the influence of that one man\/woman can so predominate that governance\nbecomes of secondary concern.\nThus, despite nationally determined practices, despite role delineation (or not) and sound\ngovernance application (or not), the values, qualities and behaviour of the leader(s) emerge as\na key ingredient to determining firm success. So why the attention to boards and the role of\nchairman? It was the Ancient Greeks who defined governance in the form of a person,\nnamely, the Kyvernitis \u2013 the oarsman or helmsman of the ship who guides the vessel through\ncalms and storms. The term survives today. In Modern Greek, the term for government is\nKyvernisi. What has not survived, however, is the duality of the leader (the helmsman),\nnamely their influence and also adoption of the necessary disciplines for guiding the vessel or\ntoday\u2019s modern equivalent, the firm, through a \u2018storm\u2019. As the US independent director\ndeclared, \u201chow can Sarbanes sort out problems of dysfunctional leadership?\u201d\nWell, one response has been to introduce impersonal governance protocols to provide\nboundaries and controls to the actions and influence of the leaders of the enterprise. But what\nof the other side, the personal side? The results of the survey reported in this chapter\nemphasise that the modern day Kyvernitis is the chairman. The chairman is the bridge\nbetween the management and the audit, overseeing and controlling body of the firm, namely\nthe board. Whatever else, the chairman determines governance pursuit, drives the board but\nalso is increasingly influential in setting the cultural tone of the organisation. In effect, the\n42\nchairman\u2019s influence (as a person) parallels their adoption of governance protocols. It is no\nsurprise, therefore, to discover that those companies considered successful are better led and\ndisplay sound governance. The converse seems to be a truism that those companies poorly\nled pay lip service to governance practice. The combination of effective leadership and\ngovernance protocol application distinguish the better run company. Perhaps one of the more\nsensitive challenges to face is the changing of the leader(s). In the better run and better\nperforming enterprise, it is the chairman (or in the USA, the board) that discusses poor\nperforming CEOs and determines the appointment of their successor. In reality, it is the\nchairman, less so the board, who determines the nature of CEO performance and either\nsupports or ensures the CEO\u2019s departure.\nThe duality of governance (person and protocol) is back in the form of the chairman, a role\nthat is now concluded to hold equal stature to that of the CEO and increasingly so in the USA.\nReferences\nAndert, D.M.
