Redistribution subject t1.3-\u0001m QD lasers, and is responsible for the strong tempera-\nture sensitivity of these lasers around RT.6,7 In this paper we\nshow that all the complicated behavior of the devices may be\nexplained in terms of the three basic processes: \u0001i\u0002 radiative\nrecombination, \u0001ii\u0002 nonradiative Auger recombination, and\n\u0001iii\u0002 thermalization of carriers between the dots.\nThe lasers investigated consist of 10 InAs QD stacks\nseparated by modulation-doped or intrinsic GaAs barriers\nand sandwiched by GaAs separate-confinement layers and\nAlGaAs cladding layers.4 Thus the transfer of holes from the\nacceptors to the QDs means that the dots in the p-doped\ndevices are positively charged. The lasers were as cleaved\nwith cavity lengths of 500 or 1000 \u0001m. The lasers were stud-\nied both under cw and pulsed operation with a pulse duration\nof 500 ns and repetition rate of 10 kHz to avoid internal\nheating when the current densities were high.\nThe temperature behaviors of Ith and Irad for both\np-doped and intrinsic devices are given in Fig. 1. Ith and Irad\nfor the intrinsic device vary identically with temperature up\nto about T=200 K, demonstrating that nonradiative recombi-\nnation is negligible in these devices at low temperature. This\nis also confirmed by the temperature dependence of L mea-\nsured below Ith at a constant current I=2 mA given in Fig. 1.\nIt shows that the radiative recombination efficiency is inde-\npendent of temperature up to approximately 200 K. There-\nfore we normalized Irad of the intrinsic device to Ith in this\ntemperature range. However, Ith increases strongly above T\n=200 K with a characteristic temperature T0=50 K in the\ntemperature range T=280\u2013360 K. At the same time, Irad for\nthe intrinsic device remains relatively constant up to T\n=320 K, indicating that the increase of Ith must be due to a\nnonradiative process, which was identified earlier as Auger\nrecombination.7 A small increase of Irad above 320 K is\ncaused by the effect of gain saturation,6,8 which is less im-\nportant in the p-doped lasers where the increase of Irad occurs\nat a higher temperature of 340 K.

This is also\nillustrated by the decrease in L at a constant 2 mA above\n60 K. Since Ith for the p-doped and undoped lasers is almost\nthe same above 320 K, there is no reason to believe that\nthere is any extra extrinsic nonradiative processes, such as\ndefect recombination, present in the p-doped device. There-\nfore this effect is also likely to be due to Auger recombina-\ntion that is enhanced at low temperatures due to the presence\nof a high density of holes compressed within the dots that\nwould greatly increase processes involving hole excitation.\nThis is the Auger process that has been observed to be the\nmost important in 1.3-\u0001m and 1.5-\u0001m quantum well lasers\naround RT.9\nThe decrease in Ith and Irad in the undoped device up to\n200 K can be attributed to the thermal escape of carriers\nfrom the dots and transfer into the deeper levels \u0001larger dots\u0002\nwhere they can take part more effectively in the lasing\nprocess.6,7 The high concentration of carriers that this in-\nvolves may lead to enhanced Auger recombination, but in the\nundoped device its total magnitude remains negligible up to\n200 K above which Auger recombination starts to dominate\nIth. The improved thermalization results in a decrease in the\nfull width at half maximum \u0001FWHM\u0002 of the SE spectrum\nobserved from the window.\nIn the p-doped dots, Irad increases slightly between 60\nand 180 K, which may be due to thermal broadening of the\nconfined states and to the onset of thermal excitation of holes\nto higher confined states. Ith, which includes the additional\nAuger component, increases even more quickly and it is not\nuntil above 180 K that thermalization starts to decrease Ith\nand Irad. The likely reason why thermalization does not start\nto become significant until higher temperatures in the\np-doped devices than in the intrinsic devices is the increased\nconfinement depth of electrons caused by the electrostatic\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 Temperature dependence of the threshold current, Ith,\nand its radiative component, Irad, and integrated spontaneous emission, L,\nmeasured at a low current of I=2 mA in the 1-mm p-doped \u0001solid symbols\u0002\nand intrinsic \u0001open symbols\u0002 devices.attraction of the holes.\nDownloaded 11 May 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tIth in the p-doped device is almost twice that in the un-\ndoped device at room temperature. However, from Fig. 1, we\nestimated that Irad accounts for up to \u000530\u201340% of Ith in both\nintrinsic and p-doped devices at T=290 K. These values are\nsimilar because not only the absolute values of Ith, but also\nthe values of Irad tend to converge at higher temperatures.\nClearly the interplay between the temperature variation of\nthe recombination processes and the temperature variation of\ncarrier thermalization can be used to advantage, and in the\np-doped devices can lead to an almost temperature-\nindependent threshold current around room temperature.4,5\nThe similar absolute value of Ith and the same temperature\ndependence of Ith above 330 K in both types of devices in-\ndicate that strong Auger recombination is the dominating re-\ncombination process in both laser types at high temperature.\nTo illustrate the variation of the spontaneous emission\n\u0001SE\u0002 spectra with temperature, we plot in Fig. 2 the spectra\nfor both types of devices measured at I=2 mA. The SE spec-\ntra of the intrinsic device contained emission from the\nground state \u0001GS\u0002 and the first excited state \u0001ES\u0002 bands over\nthe whole temperature range. Their peak positions and\nFWHM at T=100 K were 1.048 eV, 1.117 eV, and 45 meV,\nrespectively. The SE spectrum of the p-doped device con-\nsisted of three bands whose energies at T=100 K were\n1.037 eV, 1.114 eV, and about 1.185 eV for the GS, first ES,\nand second ES, respectively, with a FWHM\u0001GS\u0002=56 meV.\nThis higher value of FWHM in the p-doped devices may be\ndue to the variation in the number of holes trapped in the\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Spontaneous emission spectra of the \u0001a\u0002 intrinsic and\n\u0001b\u0002 p-doped lasers measured at I=2 mA at different temperatures.dots.

Lett. 87, 211114 \u00022005\u0001and will add to the inhomogeneous broadening. We believe\nthat the presence of the third band in the SE spectra at low\ntemperatures arises due to the decreased thermalization of\nelectrons compared to the intrinsic devices, as described\nabove, and because the positively charged dots can more\neasily accommodate electrons.\nAt temperatures below T=200 K, the intensity of the ES\nband of the intrinsic device decreases with increasing T,\nwhile the intensity of the GS band increases slightly. These\neffects compensate each other so that the total integrated\nintensity of SE remains constant in this temperature interval\n\u0001see Fig. 1\u0002. This shows that the effect of carrier redistribu-\ntion between the dots increases the population of lower en-\nergy states with increasing T and leads to the decrease of the\nthreshold current with increasing temperature up to T\n=200 K. Above this temperature the intensity of both GS and\nES bands decreased with increasing temperature at nearly the\nsame rate, demonstrating the decrease of the radiative recom-\nbination efficiency due to Auger recombination. This corre-\nlates with the strong increase of Ith shown in Fig. 1.\nThe presence of Auger recombination in the p-doped\ndevices at low temperature along with the thermal improve-\nment of carrier thermalization makes the thermal behavior of\nSE in these devices very unusual and much more compli-\ncated. Below T=60 K the shapes of the SE spectra do not\nchange but at temperatures T=60\u2013100 K, the intensity of the\nGS emission in the p-doped QDs decreases more strongly\nwith increasing T than the emission intensity of the excited\nstates, which may be caused by increasing Auger recombi-\nnation and some lack of carrier thermalization to the GS. In\nthe temperature interval T=100\u2013160 K the trend reversed\nand the emission intensity of the excited states begins to\ndecrease much faster with increasing T than the intensity of\nthe GS band due to the onset of carrier redistribution be-\ntween the dots \u0001the second ES band nearly vanishes from the\nspectrum at T=160 K\u0002. In the temperature range of T\n=160\u2013280 K, where the influence of the improved carrier\nredistribution and thermalization is larger, the intensity of the\nES band continues to decrease with increasing T, while the\nintensity of the GS band increases slightly. Finally, at tem-\nperatures above T=280 K, where carriers are close to ther-\nmal equilibrium, both GS and ES emission intensities start to\ndecrease with increasing T with the same rate due to in-\ncreased Auger recombination as it was observed in the intrin-\nsic devices above 200 K.\nIn addition, the pinning of the integrated SE intensity, L,\nabove the lasing threshold \u0001to be discussed elsewhere\u0002 im-\nproves with increasing temperature in both devices. Both L\nand the GS peak intensity pin almost ideally in the intrinsic\ndevice at higher temperatures \u0001T=300\u2013350 K\u0002. However, in\nthe p-doped device L does not pin even at higher tempera-\nture, while the GS peak intensity pins well above RT dem-\nDownloaded 11 May 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tonstrating some lack of carrier thermalization within the\np-doped QD system due to the increased potential barriers\nfor electrons in the doped devices.\nIn conclusion, we found that Ith in the intrinsic devices is\ndominated by radiative recombination up to 200 K and de-\ncreases with increasing temperature due to the improved\nthermalization of carriers between the dots. This effect is less\nabove 200 K, as indicated by the nearly constant value of\nIrad, but the onset of nonradiative Auger recombination\ncauses Ith to start to increase strongly with increasing tem-\nperature. In the p-doped QD lasers nonradiative recombina-\ntion is present even at low temperature, due to the relatively\nlarge number of holes in the dots. This increases Ith com-\npared to the intrinsic devices and causes it to increase further\nwith increasing temperature up to 180 K. Thermalization of\nelectrons between the p-doped dots does not cause Ith to\ndecrease until above 180 K, because the electrostatic attrac-\ntion of the holes increases the effective barrier for electron\nescape. Above 330 K the temperature dependencies and ab-\nsolute values of Ith in the undoped and p-doped devices are\nalmost identical. This can be explained if Auger recombina-\ntion is dominant in both. This complicated interplay of car-\nrier thermalization with the radiative and nonradiative re-\ncombination processes is supported by analysis of the\nspontaneous emission spectra in the doped and undoped\nsamples. Interestingly, introducing the correct degree of p\ndoping can cause the opposing effects of carrier thermaliza-\ntion and Auger recombination to cancel around room tem-\nperature, leading to an almost temperature-independent Ith, or\ninfinite T0.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge EPSRC for financial\nsupport.
