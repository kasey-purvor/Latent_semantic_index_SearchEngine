Introduction\n[2] The plasmasphere is a region of near Earth space\nwhich typically extends from the ionosphere out to 4 RE\n(L \u0002 4) [e.g., Baumjohann and Treumann, 1999]. The\nplasmasphere particle properties and the location of its outer\nboundary, the plasmapause, are extremely dynamic,\nresponding chiefly to changes in the dawn-dusk electric\nfield caused by varying solar wind conditions. Under\nextreme storm-time conditions the plasmapause has been\ndetected as close as L \u0002 2 [e.g., Chi et al., 2000]; while after\nan extended geomagnetically quiet interval the plasma-\nsphere extends such that the plasmapause may not be\napparent until L \u0002 8 [e.g., Carpenter and Anderson, 1992].\n[3] Plasmaspheric plasma is predominantly cold (\u00021 eV),\nand its major ionic constituent is H+, with a smaller quantity\nof He+ (N(He+)\/N(H+) \u0001 0.3 [e.g., Lemaire et al., 1998, and\nreferences therein]). O+ ions are also present, and typically\nN(O+)\/N(H+) \u0001 0.1 [e.g., Comfort et al., 1988], but on\noccasion during active times this ratio may become close to\nunity [e.g., Horwitz et al., 1984]. The behavior of these two\nheavy ion species is currently poorly understood but is an\nimportant consideration when interpreting plasma mass\ndensity profiles [e.g., Menk et al., 2004; Fraser et al.,\n2005]. Some studies have shown that an enhanced O+\npopulation may be present in the vicinity of the plasma-\npause following geomagnetic storms [e.g., Horwitz et al.,\n1984; Dent et al., 2006], however the frequency of occur-\nrence and the conditions required to precipitate this effect\nthis are unknown.\n[4] Storm-time drainage of plasmaspheric plasma has\nbeen monitored for several decades, and recent IMAGE\nEUV images of the He+ population have shown drainage\nplumes, or tails, extending out from the day-side plasma-\nsphere toward the magnetopause [e.g., Sandel et al., 2001;\nGoldstein et al., 2003; Sandel et al., 2003]. The time\ntaken for a flux tube to reach a density minima, which\ncould be considered to represent the beginning of the\nrefilling process, is difficult to determine, hindering a better\nunderstanding of the processes controlling the rate of\nplasma drainage.\n[5] This paper presents a ground-based survey of\nobserved geomagnetic field line resonance frequencies and\nthe resulting equatorial plasma mass densities which are\nderived from those frequencies. Specifically, the field line\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, A08204, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014194, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta,\nCanada.\n2School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of\nNewcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.\n3Dipartimento di Fisica, Universita` dell\u2019Aquila, L\u2019Aquila, Italy.\n4Space Research Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Graz,\nAustria.\n5Department of Communication Systems, University of Lancaster,\nLancaster, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2009JA014194$09.00\nA08204 1 of 12\nresonance frequency and plasma mass density values for\n38\u0001 ] magnetic latitude ] 63\u0001, for the so-called\n\u2018\u2018Hallowe\u2019en\u2019\u2019 storms interval between 28 October and\n6 November 2003 are examined as functions of Universal\nTime and field line location.\n2. Data Analysis\n[6] The cross-phase technique has been developed in\norder to allow a profile of field line resonance frequencies\nto be identified using arrays of latitudinally separated\nground-based magnetometers [e.g., Baransky et al., 1989;\nWaters et al., 1991, 1994, 1995, and references therein]. The\ntechnique assumes that each field line is excited at its\nnatural frequency, although the power at this frequency\nusually does not dominate the spectra, and may be at the\nlevel of the broadband background signal. The resonance\noccurs as a toroidal mode wave, i.e., monitored in the\nNorth-South, or, H-component ground-based geomagnetic\nfield data after an assumed 90\u0001 polarization rotation upon\ntransmission through the ionosphere [e.g., Hughes, 1974].\nBy comparing the H-component amplitude and phase spec-\ntra from two latitudinally separated ground-based magne-\ntometer stations, the local field line resonance frequency\nmay be identified, even though that frequency may not\ndominate the spectra. A resonance frequency is identified\nwhere a peak in phase difference (cross-phase) and a zero\ncrossing, with negative gradient, of the amplitude difference\noccurs. This analysis is based on the expected 180\u0001 phase\nchange, and amplitude peak through a resonance frequency.\nBy examining all power ranges within the geomagnetic field\ndata spectra, we are therefore able to construct a latitudinal\nprofile of field line resonance frequencies, and monitor it as\na function of time. For the cross-phase technique to be\nsuccessful, pairs of stations must be sufficiently latitudinally\nseparated that two distinct field line resonance frequencies\noccur, but the pair must be close enough that the signals are\nhighly coherent.\n[7] The natural field line resonance frequency of a flux\ntube depends on the length of that tube between the north\nand south ionospheres, the magnetic field strength, and the\nplasma mass density distribution along the field line. By\nassuming some geomagnetic field geometry and plasma\ndensity distribution, an observed latitudinal profile of\nresonance frequencies may be inverted in order to deter-\nmine a plasma mass density profile in the equatorial plane.\nIn the present study, the Singer et al. [1981] linearized\nwave equation was solved using a Tsyganenko 01 (T01\n[Tsyganenko, 2002a, 2002b]) geomagnetic field model and\nassuming an inverse power law radial density variation\nalong field lines, r = req(r\/req)\n\u0003m, with m = 3, where r (req)\nand r (req) are the density and radial distance along the\nfield line (at the equator), respectively. Menk et al. [1999]\nfound that the value of m can be highly variable, with\nvalues between 1 and 6, but that the chosen value is not\ncritical for obtaining reliable estimates of the equatorial\nplasma mass density. For the current study, errors associated\nwith cross-phase determined densities are estimated from\nthe range of uncertainty associated with determining the\nfield line resonance frequencies.\n[8] Note that at lower magnetic latitudes (\u000145\u0001, L ] 2),\nthe use of a much steeper radial density variation may be\nmore appropriate and a larger contribution to the eigenfre-\nquency from the ionospheric density profile is expected\n[e.g., Menk et al., 2000; Poulter et al., 1984; Vellante and\nFo\u00a8rster, 2006]. A r\u00033 radial density distribution has been\nadopted at all magnetic latitudes studied for consistency,\nwhich may result in an overestimation of densities at the\nlower latitudes. Any overestimation is unlikely to affect the\ninferred day-to-day variations at the low L shells, and hence\nis unlikely to affect the overall conclusions from this study.\nFigure 1.

Enhanced geomagnetic\nactivity occurred until a minimum Dst value of \u0003383 nT\nwas monitored at 2300 UT on 30 October, after which storm\ntime recovery commenced. During the most active period\nthe solar wind reached speeds greater than 1000 km\/s and\nthe IMF BZ (GSM coordinates) was strong and periodically\nnorthward and southward. The recovery phase, shown by\nthe increasing Dst and decreasing Kp indices, continued\nuntil a second SSC took place at 0625 UT on 4 November.\nThe resulting second disturbance was less intense and\nshorter lived in terms of Kp and Dst than that following\nthe first SSC.\n[11] Of the thirteen station pairs, four were chosen to\nmonitor field line resonant frequency as a function of time\nthroughout the study interval, while all thirteen were\nemployed to produce daily profiles with good spatial\nresolution.\n[12] Figure 3 shows the time variation of field line\nresonance frequencies as monitored by four magnetometer\nstation pairs: AQU-CST, HAD-YOR, YOR-CRK and NUR-\nOUJ, with midpoints at northern magnetic latitudes (mlat)\nof 38.58\u0001, 49.24\u0001, 52.79\u0001 and 58.99\u0001, respectively. These\nfield line resonance frequency values were determined via\nthe cross-phase technique, with Fourier transform data\nwindows between 20 and 50 minutes duration. The higher\nfrequencies appear at lower latitudes. For the HAD-YOR,\nYOR-CRK and NUR-OUJ pairs, the frequencies are lower\nfor up to three days after the 0611 UT SSC, then increase\nFigure 3.

This error represents the uncertainty associated\nwith determining the field line resonance frequencies.

Equatorward of 50\u0001N mlat, only modest variations\nin apex location occurred, but poleward of 50\u0001 mlat,\nsignificant stretching occurred during the storm main phase.\n[15] Figure 8 shows the variation of field line resonance\nfrequency with magnetic latitude, as monitored for\n28 October\u20136 November by the thirteen station pairs listed\nin Table 1. Again, the resonance frequencies were deter-\nmined using Fourier transform data windows between 20\nand 50 minutes duration, and were centred on 0930 UT \u00b1\n1 hour. Note that a resonance frequency value was unable to\nbe determined for every station pair at this UT every day.\nThis in itself may be an important feature as cross-phase\npeaks may be suppressed at the plasmapause or other large\ndensity discontinuities [e.g., Milling et al., 2001].

Discussion\n4.1. Post-SSC Resonant Frequency Decrease\n[16] Figure 3 shows that shortly after the SSC on\n29October, a sharp decrease of field line resonance frequency\noccurred at the three midlatitude field lines monitored\n(HAD-YOR, YOR-CRK, and NUR-OUJ). Although an\naccurate field line resonance frequency could not be deter-\nmined for the low-latitude AQU-CST station pair immedi-\nately prior to the SSC, a sharp decrease of frequency of the\ncross-phase peak in the dynamic spectrogram (Figure 4) is\nclear after the SSC (until around 0800 UT). A similar trend\nis also present in the dynamic cross-phase spectra between\nthe other pairs of the low latitude SEGMA magnetometer\nstation pairs examined (not shown). Figure 5 shows the\nresonance frequency decrease monitored by the YOR-CRK\nstation pair following the SSC.\n[17] Figure 3 shows that the low latitude station pair,\nAQU-CST, monitored a subsequent increase in resonance\nfrequency, fr, (and a decrease in density, Figure 6) through\nthe day following this initial SSC related fr decrease. The\nsame rise of fr is clear in the dynamic cross-phase spectra of\nall six low latitude (SEGMA) station pairs (not shown). In\ncontrast, the three midlatitude station pairs demonstrated a\ncontinued decrease of frequency (and a increase in density)\nas the day progressed. This implies that the midlatitude flux\ntubes monitored by the SAMNET stations were in general\nundergoing different physical processes than the lower\nlatitude flux tubes monitored by the low-latitude SEGMA\nstations; or the cause of the sharp field line resonance\nfrequency decrease could have been the same at all lati-\ntudes, but was shorter lived at the lower latitudes.\n[18] A decrease of field line resonance frequency is\ncaused either by an enhancement of density, or field-line\nlengthening. During the course of a severe geomagnetic\nstorm when the magnetospheric cavity is compressed, field-\nline lengthening is unlikely unless the ring current pene-\ntrates to low L shells, and Figure 7 shows that is unlikely to\nhave occurred in that region on 29 October. An increase of\nplasma mass density is in fact shown in Figure 6. The rate of\ndensity increase shown in Figure 6 was as high as 965 amu\/\ncc\/hour. Such an increase of plasma mass density may be\nachieved by up-flowing O+ ions from the ionosphere.\nFraser et al. [2005] showed that O+ ions may be enhanced\nin the vicinity of the plasmapause following a storm onset.\nFigure 7. T01 derived apex location for four field lines for 28 October\u20136 November 2003 (AQU-CST,\nmlat = 38.58\u0001N; HAD-YOR, mlat = 49.24\u0001N; YOR-CRK, mlat = 52.79\u0001N; NUR-OUJ, mlat = 58.99\u0001N).\nDashed vertical lines have been placed at the UT of the two SSCs occurring during this interval.\nA08204 KALE ET AL.: PLASMASPHERE DYNAMICS\n6 of 12\nA08204\nAllan [1993] suggest that the pondermotive force may\naccelerate ionospheric particles toward the equatorial plane,\nthe acceleration increasing with L shell and particle mass,\ni.e. O+ ions would undergo the greatest acceleration and\nhence outflow. An alternative mechanism was offered by\nYeh and Foster [1990], who examined Millstone Hill\nincoherent scatter radar observations in the dusk sector\nduring the course of a severe geomagnetic storm, and\nobserved an enhanced O+ outflow for over four hours\nduring the storm event. Yeh and Foster concluded that the\ncombined effects of ring current ion precipitation and rapid\nion convection could explain their observation, and that\nunder such conditions the resulting ionospheric heating\ncould represent a significant source of magnetospheric\nthermal O+ ions. Also, O+ upflow may be caused in auroral\nregions, which extended to low latitudes for this event [e.g.,\nStevenson et al., 2001; To\u00b4th et al., 2007].\n[19] Chi et al. [2005] monitored plasma mass density\nalong a meridian spanning 2.4 \u0001 L \u0001 9.5 in the North\nAmerican sector (LT = UT \u0003 6.3 hours) throughout this\nHallowe\u2019en event. They also found a significant density\nenhancement on 29 October, peaking at four to five times\nlarger than the typical density on 30 October. This shows\nthat this density enhancement was not a highly localized\neffect, limited to a specific meridian or local time sector. Chi\net al. compared their results to those of Total Electron\nContent (TEC) up to \u000220 000 km, which showed tongues\nof ionization in the region where the enhanced plasma mass\ndensity was observed. They therefore suggested that plas-\nmaspheric drainage plumes were being monitored, but\nnoted that the density enhancement occurred unusually\nquickly, and also discussed the possibility of O+ rich\noutflow from the ionosphere, or an inner ionospheric source\nof dense plasma as being possible causes. Figure 3 of Chi et\nal. shows a density increase between 00 UT and 12 UT\n(local nightside sector) on 29 October, which did not\ncorrespond to an increase in TEC, so is suggestive of an\nenhanced heavy ion population. The observations presented\nhere suggest O+ outflow played an important role in total\nmass density dynamics during this storm, especially at\nmidlatitudes.\n[20] Takasaki et al. [2006] also studied this event at low\nlatitudes (L \u0002 1.4) using ground-based magnetometer data\nfrom Japan (LT = UT + 9 hours). While they did not\nmonitor a significant decrease of field-line resonant fre-\nquency on 29 October (in fact they did not present data for\n29 October following the SSC at 0611 UT), they did\nmonitor a large decrease of frequency (increase of mass\ndensity) below quiet-day values following the large\ndecrease of Dst early on 31 October. The TEC value for that\nregion was close to quiet time values, leading Takasaki et al.\nto suggest that an up-flow of O+ ions from the ionosphere\nwas the cause, consistent with our interpretation on higher\nlatitude field-lines at earlier times. The Takasaki et al.\ndensity increase at L \u0002 1.4 persisted for only a few hours,\nand this was explained in terms of a combination of the O+\nenhancement and plasmaspheric erosion, or due to the effect\nof gravity.\n[21] The profile plots (Figures 8 and 9) show that the\ndecrease of resonance frequency (increase of plasma mass\ndensity) between 28 and 29 October (both monitored at\n0930 UT) was observed at all magnetic latitudes between\n40\u0001 and 59\u0001N (low- to midlatitudes).\n[22] Collectively, these observations of enhanced mass\ndensity occurring on different days along different meri-\ndians during this storm interval suggest that there can be a\ndelicate competition between density enhancements from\nheavy ion up-flow from the ionosphere and losses creating\nplasmaspheric density decreases generating a response\nwhich can have structure and variation with local time\nand UT.\n[23] Dent et al. [2006] monitored enhanced mass density\nin a region of unchanging electron number density, follow-\ning a Dst decrease beginning at \u00021900 LT the previous day,\nconsistent with O+ outflow. The observations of enhanced\nmass density mentioned above occurred following a\ndecrease of Dst which began between 1900 LT and 0900 LT\n(i.e., the night-side sector). The day-side sector (\u00020900\u2013\n1900 LT) is where plasmaspheric plasma is convected\nFigure 8. Daily field line resonance frequency profiles for\n0930 UT.

Data points have been joined to guide the\neye.\nA08204 KALE ET AL.: PLASMASPHERE DYNAMICS\n7 of 12\nA08204\nsunward during geomagnetic storms, so it is plausible that\nany O+ up-flow from the ionosphere occurring in this local\ntime sector following a SSC would not be monitored as a\nmass density increase.\n[24] In addition to plume formation, other possible sce-\nnarios which would explain a rapid enhancement of plasma\nmass density are plasmaspheric compression [e.g., Tsurutani\net al., 2004], outflow arising from lifting of the ionosphere\nF layer to a region of reduced recombination during the\nstorm main phase [e.g., Soicher, 1976], or convection of\ndense flux tubes with low latitude footprints into the field of\nview of higher latitude station pairs. None of these processes\nwould cause an increase in the proportion of heavy ions, as\nshown by Takasaki et al. [2006] and Chi et al. [2005],\nhowever. It is of course possible that more than one process\nwas in effect. Clearly more observations of ion populations\nand\/or coordinated studies of plasma mass density and\nelectron number density, for example, are required to better\nunderstand the local time effects of geomagnetic storm\nrelated mass density enhancements and the balance between\nheavy ion outflow and convective flux tube dynamics.\n4.2. Plasmaspheric Density Depletion\n[25] Figures 6 and 9 show plasma density values decreas-\ning following the geomagnetic storm of 29 October. This\nplasmaspheric erosion continued until 31 October.\n[26] In their ISEE study of electron number density,\nCarpenter and Anderson [1992] estimated that a well\nFigure 9. Daily plasma mass density profiles for 0930 UT. The left-hand column plots density as a\nfunction of station pair midpoint magnetic latitude, and the right-hand column plots density as a function\nof field line apex location. Profiles are plotted similarly to Figure 8, and error bars shown are those\ncalculated using the uncertainty associated with the resonance frequency values. Data points have been\njoined to guide the eye.\nA08204 KALE ET AL.: PLASMASPHERE DYNAMICS\n8 of 12\nA08204\ndefined plasmapause should appear locally in the late\nafternoon-dusk sector approximately 10 hours after the\nbeginning of the convection episode causing the depletion.\nThis is a much shorter timescale than shown in Figure 6.\nBaker et al. [2004] presented some IMAGE satellite EUV\nimages of the plasmaspheric He+ population for this Hal-\nlowe\u2019en 2003 interval. Although images were not presented\nfor every day throughout the storm, they clearly observed a\nglobally depleted plasmasphere by 0138 UT on 31 October;\nwith the He+ plasmapause laying inside 2 RE, and a plasma-\nspheric drainage plume clearly present in the afternoon\nsector. This is in reasonable agreement with our plasma\ndensity profiles for 30 October (Figure 9, right hand\ncolumn), which shows a plasmapause, defined in terms of\ntotal mass density, around 2.6 RE.\n[27] Note that no field line resonance frequencies were\nobtained for the profile plots at lower latitude station pairs\n(mlat \u0001 42\u0001N) between 31 October and 2 November. A\nsuppression of the cross-phase peak may be indicative that\nthese station pairs were in the vicinity of the plasmapause or\nsome other steep plasma density gradient throughout this\ninterval [see Milling et al., 2001], consistent with the Baker\net al. [2004] IMAGE EUV images.\n4.3. Field Line Distortion\n[28] Figure 7 shows that for eight of the ten days studied,\nonly the highest latitude station pair (NUR-OUJ, mlat =\n58.99\u0001N) shows regular diurnal field line stretching along\nthe dawn and dusk flanks, with a minimum apex location\nacross the noon meridian [see Waters et al., 1995]. More-\nover, on 30 and 31 October a significant amount of field-\nline stretching took place along field lines with footprints at\nmlat \u0004 49\u0001N (i.e., poleward of HAD-YOR), as indicated by\nthe increase of apex location value (Figure 7). This field line\nstretching occurred during the two days following the first\nSSC, when jDstj was large and also when plasma mass\ndensity was decreasing (Figure 6). The stretching became\nmore severe in the local afternoon sector, consistent with\npenetration of the partial ring current. Field line stretching\nand plasma depletion taking place simultaneously is an\nentirely expected scenario in the context of a penetrating\nring current and plasmaspheric drainage plumes.\n[29] Figure 9 shows plasma density depletion at magnetic\nlatitudes \u0004 50\u0001N between 29 and 30 October, and as\ndiscussed above, this is likely to be due to the field line\nstretching as calculated by the T01 model causing an\nincreased flux tube volume. However, it is entirely possible\nthat additional plasma loss also occurred along these flux\ntubes.\n[30] Note that if plasma density is derived assuming a\ndipolar magnetic field geometry, then the density enhance-\nment monitored immediately following the SSC appears to\nbe maintained through 30 and 31 October, with no diurnal\ndensity decreases monitored through these days.\n4.4. Drainage Plume\n[31] The diurnal trend monitored on 1 November\n(Figures 3 and 6), which Figure 2 shows is the first\ngeomagnetically quiet day after the first SSC, does not\nshow typical refilling. The NUR-OUJ (mlat = 58.99\u0001N)\nstation pair monitors a decrease followed by an increase of\ndensity through the day, consistent with the field-line\nencountering the remnants of the plasmaspheric drainage\nplume.\n4.5. Plasmaspheric Refilling\n[32] Figure 6 shows that by 2 November the diurnal\ndensity variations reached a minimum early morning value\nat the YOR-CRK and NUR-OUJ station pairs (mlat = 52.79\nand 58.99\u0001N respectively). This shows that storm-time\ndepletion was complete, with diurnal refilling both increas-\ning plasma mass density through the course of each day, but\nalso resulting in a gradual density increase from day to day.\nIndeed, Figure 9 shows no noticeable decrease of density\nbetween 2 and 3 November at 0930 UT. At that time there\nwere significant diurnal variations with night-side deple-\ntions occurring in addition to the day-side refilling.\n4.6. Early Morning Frequency Maxima\n[33] On 2 November, Figure 3 shows a sharp increase of\nfield line resonance frequency early in the morning, mon-\nitored by the YOR-CRK and NUR-OUJ station pairs.\nFigure 6 shows a corresponding sharp density decrease\nderived from these values and Figure 7 shows no significant\nchange in the field line apex locations during this interval.\nThe early morning very low value of resonance frequency\nmay be attributed to a quarter-wave mode standing Alfve\u00b4n\nwave, which can occur when the footprints of a field line are\neither side of the dawn terminator. Such a scenario is\ndescribed in detail by Obana et al. [2008].\n4.7. Density Dynamics Following the Second SSC\n[34] At 0625 UT on the 4 November the second SSC\noccurred, and the geomagnetic indices plotted in Figure 2\nshow that the disturbance this produced was less severe, and\nshorter-lived, than that following the SSC on 29 October.\nOne very interesting feature on this day is the large range\nof resonant frequencies (and plasma mass densities) mon-\nitored, particularly by YOR-CRK (mlat = 52.79\u0001N) and\nNUR-OUJ (mlat = 58.99\u0001N) data (Figure 3). The resonant\nfrequency decrease at midlatitudes is similar to that\nshown for 29 October in Figures 3 and 6. On 29 October\nthe decrease of field line resonance frequency occurred\nrapidly, followed by a slower diurnal increase monitored\nby the lowest latitude station pair, and further slower\ndiurnal decrease monitored by the higher midlatitude\nstation pairs. On 4 November, however, the field line\nresonance frequency decreased more gradually following\nthe SSC and with a clear, if less steep, continued decrease\nthroughout the rest of the daytime observations by the\nthree higher midlatitude station pairs in Figure 6. As with\nthe 29 October SSC, the behavior of resonance frequency\nimmediately following the 4 November SSC could indi-\ncate an enhancement of the heavy ion, possibly O+,\npopulation throughout 4 November. Alternatively, these\nstation pairs may have monitored dense plasmaspheric\nplasma in the day-side sector as it convected sunward.\nNo IMAGE EUV images are available for 4 November\n2003 after the SSC at 0625 UT, so this plume scenario\ncannot be investigated further.\n[35] Figure 3 shows that an overall decrease of frequency\n(corresponding to an increase of density, Figure 6) through\n5 November was monitored by the HAD-YOR (mlat =\n49.24\u0001N) and NUR-OUJ (mlat = 58.99\u0001N) station pairs.\nA08204 KALE ET AL.: PLASMASPHERE DYNAMICS\n9 of 12\nA08204\nAt YOR-CRK (mlat = 52.79\u0001N) an overall increase of\nfrequency was monitored. Such a variation of plasma\nmass density with L shell and time may be explained\nby the presence of a residual drainage plume or other\nazimuthal asymmetry of the plasmapause being monitored\nby YOR-CRK.\n[36] Figure 9 shows that plasma depletion at 56\u0001N \u0001\nmlat \u0001 59\u0001N (YOR-CRK\u2013NUR-OUJ) occurred between\n5 and 6 November. This is due to enhanced convection\nassociated with the storm following the SSC on 4 November.\n4.8. Empirical Plasmapause Models\n[37] In order to gain a better understanding of the plasma-\nspheric morphology and dynamics which explain the\nobserved density increases immediately following the SSCs\nfor these Hallowe\u2019en storms, and in the absence of electron\nnumber density observations (no suitable in situ satellite\nobservations of electron number density have been found\nfor this event), empirical plasmapause models have been\nemployed. These will show the statistical expectation of the\nplasmapause location through the interval of interest, and can\nbe compared with our observations.\n[38] Figure 10 shows predicted radial plasmapause loca-\ntion (Rpp, in units of RE) versus UT, and for the central\nmeridian (in LT, or MLT, as appropriate for each model)\nmonitored by the magnetometers employed. The Carpenter\nand Anderson [1992] (CA92) model is driven by the Kp\nindex, using the maximum Kp value which occurred in the\npreceding 24 hours, excluding some local morning hours.\nThis model is valid for 0000 \u0001 MLT \u0001 1500, and is not\nlimited during high or low Kp intervals. The O\u2019Brien and\nMoldwin [2003] (OBM03) model is driven by the Dst\nindex, using the maximum Dst value occurring during the\npreceding 24 hours. It is valid for Dst \u0001 \u00032 nT and is MLT\ndependent. The Orr and Webb [1975] (OW75) model is Kp\ndriven, using the average Kp value for the preceding local\nnighttime sector. It offers local time variation but is limited\nto average Kp values less than 4. The local and magnetic\nlocal time variations are clear in the OW75 and OBM03 Rpp\nvariations in Figure 10. All models predict the L shell of the\nplasmapause location. Also plotted are the 1000, 500 and\n100 amu\/cc density locations, linearly interpolated from\ncross phase values plotted in Figure 9. In order to minimize\nuncertainty, where the radial sepatation between data points\nis greater than 1 RE, or the density difference between two\ncross phase points is greater than one order of magnitude, an\ninterpolation has not been carried out. This range of values\ntypically identifies and spans density values which charac-\nterize the plasmapause region [e.g., Dent et al., 2006]. The\nseparation of the symbols representing these three density\nvalues at each UT indicates how shallow or steep the\nplasmapause profile is. However, the spatial resolution in\nFigure 9 arising from available station pair sampling, may\ncause the plasmapause gradient to appear smoothed. Also,\nnote that the OBM03 and CA92 models were developed\nusing data comprised only of observed steep plasmapause\nprofiles, so would not be expected to successfully predict\nthe plasmapause location on those days when a shallow\nplasmapause profile is observed. In contrast, the OW75\nmodel was developed using observations of the 10 H+ ions\nper cc location.\n[39] The OW75 model is invalid for most of 29 October\u2013\n1 November. The OBM03 and CA92 models, however,\nshow a statistical expectation of an inward motion of the\nplasmapause, of 0.6 RE immediately following the SSC on\n29 October, and a total of 2 RE by 30 October, respectively\n(compared to the prestorm plasmapause locations). There is\nno similar trend in the limited cross-phase-derived data for\nthis period; the 1000 amu\/cc density location is at the same\nradial location on 31 October as 29 October. The models did\nnot take account of heavy ions, so this disparity could add\nFigure 10. Empirical plasmapause model predictions versus universal time for 28 October\u2013\n6 November 2003. Predictions shown are from the local time dependent, Kp-driven [Orr and Webb,\n1975] model [OW75]; the magnetic local time-dependent, Dst-driven [O\u2019Brien and Moldwin, 2003]\nmodel [OBM03]; and the non-local time dependent, Kp-driven [Carpenter and Anderson, 1992] model\n[CA92]. The location of 1000, 500, and 100 amu\/cc density values along each profile presented in\nFigure 9 are shown by open circles, squares, and triangles, respectively. Vertical dotted lines have been\nplaced at the UT of the two SSCs, which occurred during this interval.\nA08204 KALE ET AL.: PLASMASPHERE DYNAMICS\n10 of 12\nA08204\nweight to the hypothesis of enhanced O+ during this\ninterval. Note, however that Figures 9 and 6 do not show\na similar density depletion through 29 and 30 October.\nDensity depletion is shown in these figures to have occurred\nby 1 November, more than one day after the empirical\nmodel predictions.\n[40] The OBM03 and CA92 models predict an outward\nmoving plasmapause between 31 October and 2 November,\nby \u00021.7 and >2 RE, respectively (measured between the\nmaximum Rpp location on each day). This would indicate\nrefilling taking place along field lines inward of the pre-\ndicted plasmapause location. The cross-phase-derived 1000\nand 500 amu\/cc locations move inward through this inter-\nval, suggesting depletion was taking place, or at least\nstretched field lines were relaxing back to a more dipolar\ngeometry (Figure 7). It is clear from our results that overall\na net increase in day-to-day density due to refilling does not\noccur until 2 November, one day after the empirical models\u2019\npredictions. However, by 2 November the empirical models\nare in good agreement with the cross-phase-derived 500\u2013\n100 amu\/cc location.\n[41] On 4 November the distance between the 1000 and\n500 amu\/cc locations indicates a shallower density gradient\nthan during the preceding two days. This occurred after the\nSSC and approximately when the CA92 and OBM03\nmodels predict a sharp inward movement of the plasma-\npause. This shallower density gradient could be due to the\nsuspected upflowing of heavy ions, or could be a result of\nthe poststorm refilling which took place during the preced-\ning two days.\n[42] The OW75 model predicts a slight inward motion of\nthe plasmapause between 5 and 6 November. This is in\nresponse to the enhanced Kp index late on 5 November, not\nthe enhanced levels on 4 November. However, this predic-\ntion of the OW75 model does imply plasma loss and is\nconsistent with the observation of plasma depletion at 3 ]\napex R ] 4 between 5 and 6 November (Figure 9). The\nCA92 and OBM03 models predict an outward moving\nplasmapause between 5 and 6 November, an opposite trend\nto the cross-phase-derived (inward) trend.\n[43] Generally, the OBM03 and CA92 models have good\ncoverage throughout the storm interval, whereas the\nOW75 model was less useful for interpretation since it\nwas invalid throughout the storm main and early recovery\nphases. The innermost model predicted plasmapause loca-\ntions on 1 November of Rpp \u0001 2 is slightly inward of cross-\nphase-derived depletion to R ^ 2.6, as shown in Figure 9.\nThe CA92 and OBM03 models tend to successfully predict\nthe observed trends of plasmapause motion in response to\nplasmaspheric depletion and refilling, albeit approximately\none day prematurely.\n5. Conclusion\n[44] This study presents ground-based magnetometer\nderived observations of plasma mass density dynamics\nbetween magnetic latitude = 37\u0001N and 63\u0001N for 28 Octo-\nber\u20136 November 2003, the \u2018\u2018Hallowe\u2019en\u2019\u2019 storm interval.\nImmediately following the SSC on 29 October a plasmamass\ndensity increase occurred at all latitudes monitored, probably\ndue to up-flowing O+ ions from the ionosphere. A similar\nplasma mass density trend was also observed following\nthe SSC on 4 November, and O+ ions are also suggested to\nbe the cause.\n[45] IMAGE EUV images presented by Baker et al.\n[2004] show a depletion of the He+ plasmaspheric popula-\ntion by early on 31 October, in agreement with the plasma\nmass density dynamics presented here. This study further\nemphasizes the importance of choosing an appropriate\ngeomagnetic field line model when deriving plasma mass\ndensities from ground-based magnetometer derived field\nline eigenfrequencies.\n[46] The location of the plasmapause throughout a storm\ninterval is considered to be of increasing importance for\nradiation belt dynamics. There is evidence that the inner\nedge of the outer zone Van Allen electron radiation belt is\nwell correlated with the position of the plasmapause [e.g.,\nBaker et al., 2004]. Explanations may include the effect of\nelectron density and plasmapause location control of the\nmass density on the penetration of ULF waves [Loto\u2019aniu et\nal., 2006] or the effectiveness of VLF wave-particle inter-\nactions [e.g., Blanc et al., 1999], respectively, which may be\ninvolved in radiation belt acceleration.\n[47] In terms of examining the diurnal variation of mass\ndensity, an early morning minima was monitored by two\nstation pairs on 2 November, the first day of poststorm\nrefilling. This may be the result of one field line ionospheric\nfootprint being sunlit while the other is in darkness, causing\na quarter-wave mode.\n[48] Overall, the results presented here demonstrate the\npowerful capability of employing ULF waves monitored by\nground-based magnetometers in order to study plasma mass\ndynamics in the storm-time magnetosphere. During the\nHallowe\u2019en study interval, there is evidence for a rapid\ninjection of heavy, presumably O+, ions from the ionosphere\nto the magnetosphere on timescales of \u00021 hour. Given the\nimportance of both total mass and electron density profiles in\nthe inner magnetosphere for ULF or VLF MeV electron\nacceleration, and indeed in controlling the dispersion relation\nof electromagnetic ion cyclotron EMIC waves believed to be\nimportant for MeVelectron loss, understanding total mass as\nwell as heavy ion and electron density dynamics during\nstorms is likely to be of considerable importance. ULF wave\ncross-phase monitoring from networks of ground-based\nmagnetometers can contribute significantly to such studies.\n[49] Acknowledgments. Z.C.K. thanks F.W.
