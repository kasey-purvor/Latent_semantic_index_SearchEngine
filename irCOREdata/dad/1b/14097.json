Global economic forces, \ncombined with recent advances in information and communication technologies, have \nprovided unprecedented opportunities for ducation providers to broaden the provision of \ntheir programmes both on an international scale and across new sectors. Lifelong \nlearning strategies are becoming increasingly recognized as an essential characteristic of \na successful organization and therefore large organizations have shown a preparedness to \ninvest in staff training and development. The demands for lifelong learning span a wide \nrange of training and educational levels from school-level and vocational courses to \ngraduate-level training for senior executives. \nIntroduction \nThe nature of higher education institutions i changing, primarily as a result of reduced \ngovernment financial support for the sector. Fiscal restraint towards education funding has \nbeen observed in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, the UK and much of \nEurope. There has been steady growth in demand for higher education but reduced \ncapacity by governments to fund it. Increasingly, students are required to contribute to the \ncost of their own education. Although these trends are problematic for higher education \ninstitutions that have been reliant previously upon government funding, it has also created \nan opportunity for those that are able to fill the gap between supply and demand for higher \neducation services. \nAs well as changes affected by government, there have been changes to the nature of the \ndemand for higher education. Universities and other education and training providers are \n84 \nALT-] Volume 9 Number I \nfacing the challenge of meeting the n eds of a more diverse range of learners. Expectations \nin relation to time, place, nature and scope of the desired learning experience require \ninstitutions to provide a wider range of learner-centred experiences which are supported by \nquality assurance. The combined effect of increased and varied demand for highe~ \neducation through massification policies and the reduction in public funding for education \nhas meant hat many education providers are looking to commercialize their educational \nprogrammes and services in an effort to maintain their sustainability. To do so requires a\nfundamental shift in the culture and structure of many traditional higher education \nproviders. \nFrew (1999: 21) suggests that educational institutions, including higher education, are \nbeing forced to be more competitive on the open market, to develop best practice and \nquality assurance, and to be customer-focused. He argues that the dominant traditional \nhierarchical culture of most universities does not support these practices. Instead, aculture \nthat encourages creativity, innovation and institutional visibility, combined with a major \nfocus on the bottom line, is advocated. The approach requires educational institutions to \nbe able to adapt readily in response to an environment which is changing almost \nconstantly. \nLatham (1999) argues that networks are a natural mode of organization for an information \nsociety; they establish 'horizontal' relationships of trust, negotiation and reciprocity. By \ndefinition, a network has no centre of authority. Rather it relies on a dense web of \ncollaboration, creativity and multi-skilling to secure its competitive success. The demands \nof multi-disciplinary and integrated research cannot be met without a close relationship \nbetween universities and other centres of knowledge. Similarly, stronger private resourcing \nof universities relies on the right kind of relationship with the private sector, going beyond \nstrictly commercial relationships dominated by contractual obligations. Universities \nshould be willing to commercialize their ideas directly and take a partnership role in \nindustry clusters. This unique blend of collaboration and competition is a defining feature \nof the new network economies. \nLatham (1999) concludes that there is a third way in higher education, beyond markets and \nhierarchies. It is the network university. While market-based systems may improve the \nquality of some universities, it is a poor way of dealing with equity. In the absence of \ngrowth funding, the current system of public hierarchies i  delivering a lose-lose outcome - \ndeteriorating quality and equality across the university sector. He argues that only an \nadaptable system of network universities can deliver win-win results on every policy front. \nThe solution outlined in this paper is based on combining Latham's concept of a 'network \nuniversity' and the concept of 'productive diversity' as described by Cope and Kalantzis \n(1997), which describes the development of strategic oalitions between traditional \neducational institutions and non-traditional organizations to allow for the provision of \nskills and new competencies required by individuals in government, academia nd \ncommerce. It is a pertinent concept, in light of postmodern views that emphasize \npluralism, the breakdown of  old boundaries and the need for new discourse which is \ninclusive of the 'other' (Goodenow, 1996: 197). This solution is reflected in our proposal to \nbuild partnerships with mutually suitable industries to develop effective learning alliances. \nGriffith Flexible Learning Services at Griffith University in Australia is already negotiating \n85 \nMichael Crock et al Developing strategic learning alliances \npartnerships or 'learning alliances' with a variety of non-traditional industries in an effort \nto expand its flexible education programmes to meet the demands of global education \nmarkets. \nA f ramework  to assist in identifying strategic partnerships \nTo assist an education or training provider in identifying suitable strategic partnerships \nwhich will allow them to exploit global education markets, seven distinct operational \nbusiness components have been identified (see Figure 1). These allow for a comprehensive \napproach in the provision of educational solutions and foreshadow the production, \ndistribution and maintenance of digital content and for the management of commercial \nactivities associated with that content. While these components cover a broad range of \nfunctions, they rely on close integration, flexibility and efficiency in delivery to ensure \nquality is not compromised. \nManr~etpinog~lSeales \n(Globa Profile) \nService Interface \n(Administration \nEnrolment, \nManagement and \nCertification) \nDelivery, \nInteraction and \nOnline \nAssessment \nTools \nFigure I: Operational business components. \nProductivity \nTools for \nContent \nGeneration and \nMaintenance \nDelivery \nNetwork \nInfrastructure \nStorage and \nRetrieval of \nDigital IP \n(Version and \nStock Control) \ne-Business \nSolutions for \nDigital \nProducts and \nServices \nThese seven components are described more fully below: \nMarketing, sales and profile (global profile) \nThis component is required to identify and maintain profiles of existing and potential \nclients and associates. Profiles are then used to target market segments and support public \nrelations functions for market positioning. This component also provides ongoing \nevaluation and assessment of other business components. \nService interface (administration, enrolment, management and certification) \nThis component interfaces with the e-Business olutions, the marketing component and \nthe storage of digital IP (intellectual property) components. It allows clients o enrol via \nonline and offiine proeessing. It should feature xtensive statistics and reporting details on \na client's enrolment and progression through course materials, and provide a framework \nfor client support services. \nDelivery, interaction and online assessment tools \nThe elements of this component provide the means by which clients access course \nmaterials uch as Web pages and other documents and provide efficient mechanisms to\nallow students to interact with academic staff and other students. The forms of interaction \ninclude email, group discussion forums, real-time communications such as chat and real- \ntime audio and video links. Online assessment tools enable clients to undertake a variety of \nassessment items online to get feedback on their progress and to undertake assessment for \ncredit towards their course. The tools also allow academic teams to create and manage \nonline assessment. Additional features include the ability for students to submit electronic \nversions of assignments and to participate incourse surveys via a Web-form interface. \n86 \nALr-J Volume 9 Number I \nProductivity tools for content generation and maintenance \nProductivity tools facilitate the cost-effective design, development and maintenance of the \ndigital content by academic teams and production specialists. The productivity tools suite \nshould provide a mechanism to upload content from a range of file formats and apply \ntemplates to format content according to pre-determined specifications. The tools should \nenable the auto generation of Dublin-Core\/IMS compliant metadata based on the content \nprovided. Since metadata f cilitate the categorizing, storing, searching and retrieving of \ninformation, its auto-generation is essential in a large-scale enterprise. Automation tools \nare also required for activities uch as the configuration of courses, group discussion areas, \nfrequently asked questions, and site maps. \nDelivery network infrastructure \nThis combines oftware, hardware and physical ocations. The software provides Web- \nbased serving of content; the hardware provides physical storage of content and \nconnectivity to the Internet. A variety of physical ocations needs to be identified to \nprovide efficient access to content and services in key market locations. The delivery \nnetwork infrastructure provides an internationally redundant array of systems - servers, \nrouters, etc. - to allow any node to go offiine without bringing the entire system down. \nStorage and retrieval of digital IP (version and stock control) \nAs the amount of content hat is created and stored on a Web server increases, the \ncomplexity of content management becomes exponentially critical to the success of the \nbusiness. Each version of a document will be required to be managed through three key \nphases: creation, testing and online availability on the Internet. Maintenance of the \ncontent during a course and revision at the end of each course will also require a version \ncontrol system to be implemented. This is to ensure that the most current information is\navailable to the client. As each document iscreated, modified and deleted a time stamp will \nbe applied indicating when and who modified adocument. An index of modifications will \nbe available to all users. It is essential that the system be able to interface to a Dublin \nCore\/IMS compliant database to allow searching for modules and components, thereby \nproviding acatalogue of IP components. \nE-business solutions for digital products and services \nThe e-business olutions are required to manage the sales of, licensing of, and access to \ndigital content and education and training support services. The solution is required to be \nable to sell access to modules, groups of modules (for example subjects), groups of groups \nof modules (for example degree programmes) and a range of support services. The \nsolution is required to provide online real-time transactions toenable aclient to undertake \na module or modules and process their application a d, for example, debit their credit \ncard. The solution is required to provide offline processing of transactions to allow sales \nstaff to enrol a group of clients from a corporation in a subject and then invoice the \ncorporation. In addition the e-business solutions hould manage the sales and\/or licensing \nof a component to a third party. \nHaving established the necessity of the operational business components, the effectiveness \nof the components in various integrative models of commercial ctivity can be examined. \nThese models highlight the potential for the development of strategic partnerships which \nafford holistic solutions to global education requirements in particular. The criteria for \n87 \nMichael Crock et al Developing strategic learning alliances \ndetermining the suitability of each solution includes upport for open standards, flexibility \nin modes of operation, stability of systems, operating systems oftware requirements, \nhardware requirements, scalability, security and portability. \nCommerc ia l  models and associated key drivers \nFour models for the commercialization f education and training intellectual property \nhave been identified. These are the: \n\u2022 multimedia production h use model; \n\u2022 open university provider model; \n\u2022 open learning broker model; \n\u2022 corporate university model. \nEach commercial model varies in its market orientation, thelocus of content ownership, \ntechnologies that are used, and in the business models they follow. A description of each \nmodel follows. \nThe multimedia production house model \nThe core of both conventional publication and multimedia publishing activities is the \ncontrol over content. Two key elements for success include access to a total development \nsolution comprising the multimedia production technology (development and deployment \ntools) and established marketing and distribution channels. In general, the multimedia \npublisher model has the core business components of marketing, sales and profile, \nproductivity ools for content generation and maintenance, storage and retrieval of digital \nIP, and e-business solutions for digital products and services. \nThe multimedia production model assumes that providers own or source content which is \nto be produced in digital form - typically, a Web site or a CD-ROM. The production \nfacility provides expertise in digital conversion of content for a particular audience. The \nmultimedia ndustry has evolved over recent years with an expectation that it would grow \nalong the lines of the publishing industry and indeed that large publishers would move into \nthis area, seeing it as a segment of traditional publishing. At this stage there is little \nevidence of this occurring on a large scale in higher education and training markets. Some \npublishers distribute multimedia titles. Some multimedia titles have been based upon \ncontent hat the publishers control, but it seems that they enter into partnerships with \nmultimedia developers to produce titles. Companies that have been involved in software \ndevelopment have also moved into the production of multimedia titles, since good \nmultimedia involves high levels of interactivity and this has required their software \ndevelopment skill sets. \nThe open university provider model \nAn open university model assumes that intellectual property is either sourced from within \nor bought and therefore owned by the institution. It also includes a production facility \nwhich is used to transform aterial and make it available to prospective clients. Courses \nare usually state-accredited, and access is open to anyone prepared to pay for access to \nresources and programmes. Delivery mechanisms range from face-to-face tosophisticated \ncommunications systems. In general, the open university provider model involves all seven \n88 \nALT-J Volume 9 Number I \ncore business components. As a business model, its key drivers include content, demand, \nmanagement and administration. \nThe open learning broker model \nOpen learning brokers ource content from established, reputable, usually state-accredited \ncontent providers, and make it available through marketing and distribution channels. \nThey provide co-ordinating and client service functions, whilst the students are registered \nwith the content provider. The key element of open learning brokerages is that they provide \na marketing and management system and a key characteristic is that they source content \nfrom other providers. It is this characteristic hat distinguishes them from open universities. \nOpen learning brokers also provide a range of client support services. In general, the open \nlearning broker model has the core business components of marketing, sales and profile, \nservice interface, and delivery network infrastructure. \nThe corporate university model \nThree sub-types of corporate universities have been identified: \n\u2022 in-house training and development sections of large organizations; \n\u2022 privately funded, for-profit accredited higher education providers; and \n\u2022 publicly funded universities that are commercializing their activities through corporate \nstructures. \nAll three sub-types of the corporate university model deliver programmes xtensively via \nface-to-face means. However, in each there is evidence of increasing use of information and \ncommunications technologies to achieve access and efficiency objectives in programme \ndelivery. \nThe first sub-type includes large corporations which have extensive involvement in on- \ngoing staff development programmes from quite low-level vocational courses to advanced \nexecutive professional development programmes. Typically, they are not accredited, \nalthough some may seek accreditation directly or through partnership arrangements with \nhigher education institutions. The in-house corporate training enterprise is very much \ndemand-driven: the company identifies training needs as its products or business \nenvironment changes and it seeks to re-skill its staff so that their skill sets more closely \nmatch' the emerging demands of its business. General Motors has articulated this in re- \ntasking a senior vice-president to convert its in-house training programmes and structures \nto form General Motors University. In doing this it argued that there was a need to ensure \nthat its training programmes ore closely reflected the corporation's strategic directions. \nThe second sub-type, large privately-funded profit-driven universities, offer programmes \ndirected at employees in the corporate and public sectors. They are accredited and offer \nprogrammes from vocational through undergraduate to postgraduate levels. Large-scale \nprivate universities whose market is the corporate sector are also demand-driven but, \nrather than meeting the specific strategic objectives of a single ntity, they seek to meet he \nneeds of the sector at large or of several significant segments of that market. \nThese universities operate on a different model from mainstream higher education \ninstitutions. Traditional universities have four principal functions: teaching, research, \nconsultancy and community service. Corporate universities focus on teaching, and \n89 \nMichael Crock et ol Developing strategic learning alliances \nconstrain that focus to courses that are consistent with the needs of the parent \norganization. Their offerings may well be diverse, covering technical aspects of the business \nas well as executive development, financial matters and customer service. Research is in \ngeneral a function of separate research and development divisions of the corporation. \nSome offer consultancy services about heir products to partners. Community service is a \npart of general corporate citizenship rather than a specific focus of the university. \nThe third sub-type are publicly-funded universities that are increasingly seeking to \ncommercialize their intellectual property by establishing wholly owned companies that \noperate in the corporate nvironment. These offer both established and newly developed \ncourses to meet identified emand on a fee-for-service basis. Keydrivers include available \ncontent and meeting demand. The demand may be from a single large corporate partner, \nor it could be directed at a particular industry or a segment of the general corporate \nmarket. In addition to the principal drivers of demand and content, other drivers are \nimportant in particular instances. In general, the corporate university provider model \ninvolves all seven-core business components. \nSummary of models \nThe analysis of the models presented above suggests that a particular combination of \nbusiness activity components is required to meet he challenges posed by emerging global \nmarkets uccessfully (see Figure 2). While there are strong contenders in the field, none yet \nhave assembled all the key components required to satisfy the demands of the emerging \nopportunities optimally. Key drivers that are prevalent across all models relate to demand \nand content, with the technology and communications driver increasingly affecting \ncapacity to deliver product o market. \n\"~ Component I \n[ Marketing, Service Delivery, Productivity Delivery Storage and \nI Sales and Interface Interaction and Tools for Network Retrieval of \nI Profile (Administration Online Content Infrastructure Digital IP\n(Global Profile) Enrolment, Assessment Generation (Version and \nManagement Tools and Stock Control) \nBusiness ~, and Maintenance \nMode ' \\ \\  Certification) \nMultimedia Publisher ,\/ ,\/ ~\" ,\/ ,z \nOpen University Provider ,\/ ,\/ ,z ,z ,\/ ,z \nOpen Learning Broker ,\" ,\/ ,\/ \nCorporate University ~\" ,z ,z ,z \ne-Business \nSolutions for \nDigita~ \nProducts and \nServices \nFigure 2: Configuration of core business components across models. \nA model for Griffith University \nThe four models considered represent familiar and well-established ways of operating. \nHowever, as Griffith University develops its approach to global education and training, it \nis apparent that no single model will encompass all the core business components hat are \nrequired. Consequently, the university is investigating an integrated business model, \nincorporating a multimedia publishing arm and an arm associated with the online and \n90 \nALT-J Volume 9 Number I \ndistributed provision of education and training programmes, in both the corporate and \nhigher education sectors, which includes many of the elements of the open university \nmodel. \nThe model suggested requires the university to focus its energies on the commercialization \nof both product development\/publishing and programme delivery based on market \ndemand, and its capacity to exploit existing and emerging information technologies. It\nrequires a focus on the exploitation f the university's present strengths with respect to its \nemerging range of digital intellectual property and on harnessing the diverse range of \ncommercialization activities pread across the academic elements and serviced through \ninternal entities. It also demands concentration on the provision of quality client-focused \nproducts and services as a market differentiator. \nWhen these requirements of the Griffith University model are considered in light of the \ncore business components, the university emerges as a viable partner in a global enterprise \nthat incorporates all of the components. Some of the components are already present i  \nthe university in an advanced form. Others are more highly developed in external \norganizations with whom partnerships have been, or are being, established. The following \nsection outlines these components in the context of partnership strategies. \nPartnership strategies \nMarketing, sales and profile \nSince its foundation in 1975, Griffith University has developed a strong reputation as a \nprovider of innovative ducational solutions. It is seeking to build on its existing profile by \ndeveloping productive, complementary relationships. The essence of marketing is \nrelationships (not simply 'sales'), and involves relationships with existing and potential \nclient organizations as well as with commercial partners. \nService interface \nThe university is entering into working relationships with organizations that provide state- \nof-the-art solutions to address human resource, finance and student administration \nrequirements. A critical feature of these solutions is a client-driven service at all stages of \nservice provision, from enquiries and enrolment to eventual certification. \nDelivery, interaction a d online assessment tools \nGriffith University, through Griffith Flexible Learning Services, has developed a robust \ntools set for the development and delivery of flexible learning materials and for the \nadministration and management of flexible learning programmes. The university will \nemploy some of these tools and platforms. However, in deploying an integrated system of \nthe scale envisaged and to maintain market leadership, it is necessary to ensure that all \nplatforms are, and are maintained at, best practice standards. This will be achieved through \na recently negotiated partnership with one of the leading developers of such platforms, \ngiving the university access to state-of-the-art products while also enabling the university \nto inform the development of its partner's products in directions that meet its \nrequirements. For our partner, access to the university's programmes as a real-world test \nand development vironment will lead to more functional and robust products. \nProductivity tools for content generation and maintenance \nWhile Griffith Flexible Learning Services has developed a suite of tools for automating \n91 \nMichael Crock et al Developing strategic learning alliances \nvarious aspects of Web site development, a significant enhancement of this capability will \narise from a partnership with a local enterprise whose principal product enables the easy \nmaintenance of sites by academics without the need for extensive training or technical \nsupport. \nDelivery network infrastructure \nIn order to exploit national and international opportunities to distribute content, and \ntherefore to benefit from economies of scale, multiple redundant servers are required, and \nfor these to be operated efficiently, there is a requirement for high band width connections \namong them. The provision and management of this infrastructure is the province of \nmajor telecommunications perators and a partnership with one of these is desirable. End \nusers may require connectivity, and a telecommunications perator with an ISP (Internet \nService Provider) network would be an asset o the global education operation, would \nprovide a needed service to clients and would in turn gain market share from the activity. \nThe university continues to explore potential partnerships in this area. \nStorage and retrieval of digital IP \nThe university isresponding to the need for a digital repository to input, store, manage and \nretrieve intellectual property (including courseware, agreements and other information) in\ntwo ways. Firstly, the university is examining its own capabilities for identifying and \nmanaging a wide range of resources, including the adoption of appropriate metadata \nstandards. Secondly, the university is exploring arrangements with potential partners on \nboth an international basis and with respect to national partnerships orconsortia. \nE-business solutions \nThe university has developed an integrated set of solutions with respect o a number of \nbusiness functions, including an e-commerce engine for financial transactions. E-business \nextends beyond the financial, and includes integrating a number of the core business \ncomponents that have been discussed in this paper. The university has established a \npartnership with a major international consultant with a view to providing integrated \neducation and training solutions on a whole-of-government\/whole-of-organization basis. \nConclusion \nThe development of strategic partnerships between traditional as well as non-traditional \nhigher education i stitutions are advocated for the continued sustainability of universities \nin a global economic environment. From a business perspective, holistic educational nd \ntraining solutions are advocated, and several key elements have been identified which \ncollaborative institutions would need to address in order to ensure their competitiveness in \nglobal education markets. Opportunities exist to develop global education and training \nbusinesses for those who can bring together a set of key elements of content, production, \nre-purposing content, effective delivery of content, and demand. However, the \nenvironment in which such businesses will operate is both competitive and changing \nrapidly. \nSome providers have seen the opportunity and ate moving into this area but to date no \nsingle provider has been able to assemble all required components. We would expect his \nsituation to change as others perceive the shortcomings of an individual approach and \nform partnerships to complement their strengths. The models presented illustrate that \n92 \nAtT-J Volume 9 Number I \nexisting approaches to education and training provision retain some gaps in services and \nproducts, thus strengthening the argument for identification of strategic alliances and \npartnerships with other partners. It is important for traditional education providers to \nanalyse their particular strengths and weaknesses in order to identify suitable potential \npartnerships. \nThe obvious and immediate benefit of forming partnerships is the economic sustainability \nof higher education institutions. However, despite contrary arguments in some literature \n(Taylor, Rizvi, Lingard and Henry, 1997; Jarvis, 1996) the development of strategic \npartnerships also offers potential for the sustainability of social and cultural diversity on a \nglobal scale. The formation of new alliances with non-traditional partners will necessitate \nsome organizational change within higher ducation i stitutions, allowing them to become \nmore organic and adaptable, and thus better able to meet the diverse needs of learners \nfrom around the world. \nReferences \nCope, B. and Kalantzis, M.
