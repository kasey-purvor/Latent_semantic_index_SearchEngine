We report the results of recent experiments on second sound in a high Q resonator.\nNonlinear wave interactions give rise to a form of acoustic turbulence in which there is a\nKolmogorov-like cascade of energy through the frequency scales from the frequency at which it\nis injected towards higher frequencies until, eventually, dissipative processes come to dominate\nand terminate the energy flux. We report that that, under some circumstances, an inverse\nenergy cascade occurs, whereby there is a steady flux of energy towards lower frequencies, a\nwholly unexpected result that bears on the suggestion that rogue waves on the ocean may arise\nthrough nonlinear interactions between conventional wind-blown waves.\n1. Introduction\nThe phenomenon of wave turbulence (WT) crops up in a diversity of physical contexts, including\ne.g. phonon turbulence in solids [1], turbulence of sound waves in oceanic waveguides [2], shock\nwaves in the solar wind and their coupling with Earth\u2019s magnetosphere [3], and magnetic\nturbulence in interstellar gases [4], as well as surface waves on liquid hydrogen [5] and second\nsound in superfluid 4He [6]. In each case, the system is in a highly excited state with many\ndegrees of freedom \u2013 just like the more familiar vortex turbulence. The generally accepted\npicture is that, just as in the case of vortex turbulence, there is then a directed flux of energy\nthrough rising frequency scales due to nonlinear wave interactions [7]. These result in a cascade\nof energy towards ever-shorter wavelengths until, eventually, it can be dissipated by viscous\neffects. But there have been few opportunities to test these ideas in a laboratory setting.\nIn this paper we discuss the use of He II as a modeling medium for the study of WT and\nreport our most recent results, some of which have been unexpected and serve to show that the\nconventional Kolmogorov scenario [7] is incomplete. The particular advantages of using second\nsound (temperature-entropy) waves for modeling WT are its large nonlinearity coefficient \u03b1\nand the fact that the magnitude and sign of \u03b1 can conveniently be adjusted by changing the\ntemperature T [8]. The velocity u2 of second sound is given to a good approximation by\nu2 = u20(1 + \u03b1\u03b4T ), (1)\nwhere u20 is the second sound velocity at negligibly small amplitude. The nonlinear wave\ninteractions leading to WT are expected to become important at large amplitudes, and these\nare readily attained by use of a resonant cavity. Given the small bulk attenuation of second\nsound, and the correspondingly large values of the quality Q-factor for cavity resonance, high\nsecond sound amplitudes can be created for relatively modest heat inputs to the He II sample.\n25th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics (LT25) IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 150 (2009) 032056 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/150\/3\/032056\nc\u00a9 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd 1\nFigure 1. Instantaneous second sound spectra measured (a) 1 s after the drive was applied\nat a frequency slightly detuned (\u03b4\u03c9d\/\u03c9d \u223c 10\u22124) from the 51st resonance, and (b) 70 s later.\nThe helium sample temperature was close to 2.08 K. The AC heat flux density was W = 20\nmW\/cm2. The drive frequency corresponds to the highest peak in (a) and is arrowed in (b).\n2. Experiments on second sound acoustic turbulence\nOur experimental cell has been described elsewhere [6] but, in essence, it consists of a quartz\ncylinder of length L = 7 cm capped by two endplates carrying a thin film heater and a\nsuperconducting bolometer, respectively. The heater was driven from a harmonic voltage\ngenerator within the frequency range 0.1 < \u03c9g2pi < 100 kHz. The amplitude \u03b4T of the resultant\nstanding wave of second sound (at \u03c9d = 2\u03c9g) could be varied from 0.05mK up to a few mK.\nThe Q factor of the resonator, determined from the resonant width in the linear regime at small\namplitude, was Q \u223c 3000 for resonance numbers between 30 and 100, but fell to Q \u223c 1000 for\nresonance numbers below 10.\nWhen the cavity is excited at sufficiently high amplitude close to a resonance, second sound\nacoustic turbulence is created as described previously [6], and there is then a flux of energy\nfrom \u03c9d towards higher frequencies. We now discuss what happens if the cell is detuned slightly\naway from resonance, a typical detuning being \u03b4\u03c9d\/\u03c9d \u223c 10\u22124. There are two main results to\nreport. First, in addition to the forward energy cascade to frequencies \u03c9 \u2265 \u03c9d, we observe the\nonset of a flux of energy from \u03c9d towards lower frequencies. Secondly, this inverse flux does\nnot appear immediately, but seems to take a finite time to become established. Fig. 1 shows\nsome typical results: in (a) one second after application of the drive, the forward energy flux is\nwell-established and looks very similar to the results reported earlier [6]; but a minute later the\nsituation looks very different, as shown in (b). In the latter case, a series of peaks have appeared\nat frequencies lower than \u03c9d. There is strong evidence that these represent a continuous flux of\nenergy corresponding to the formation of an inverse energy cascade. Fig. 2 (left) shows what\nhappens to the energy in the high-frequency (\u03c9 \u2265 \u03c9d) and low-frequency (\u03c9 < \u03c9d) regimes\nfollowing a small change in driving frequency at t = 19 s to populate the low frequency spectra:\nthere is a clear reduction in the flux of energy to the right, implying a sharing of energy between\ntwo fluxes, and thus the onset of a flux to the left. Fig. 2 (right) shows a time domain signal\nand how it evolves: isolated rogue waves (of amplitude larger than nearby waves) appear, as\nshown more clearly in the inset.\n25th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics (LT25) IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 150 (2009) 032056 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/150\/3\/032056\n2\nFigure 2. Left: dependence on time of the wave energy contained in the low-frequency\n(triangles) and high-frequency (squares) spectral domains after a change in the driving frequency\nat t = 19 s. Right: evolution of a signal after switch-on at t = 0.4 s; the inset is a blow-up to\nillustrate a pair of isolated rogue waves.\n3. Discussion\nIt would appear that, under certain conditions, the second sound wave undergoes a nonlinear\ndecay into two waves of lower frequency governed by the conservation law [9]\n\u03c91 = \u03c92 + \u03c93. (2)\nHere \u03c91 = u20k1 is the frequency of a linear wave of wave vector k1. This instability results in the\ngeneration of subharmonics which, for sufficient amplitude, can give rise to the inverse cascade.\nWe have tested this idea by direct numerical integration of the 2-fluid thermohydrodynamical\nequations [10], expanded up to quadratic terms in the wave amplitude. We use a Hamiltonian\nrepresentation of the second sound waves [6, 11] similar to that described earlier [12]. However,\nwe take explicit account of wave damping at all frequencies, which turns out to be essential for\na correct description of the generation of subharmonics. To correspond with the experimental\nconditions, we have assumed full reflection of the waves from the resonator boundaries, rather\nthan periodic boundary conditions [12]. The results in Fig. 3(a) show that, as the instability\ndevelops, isolated rogue waves appear in the signal (cf. Fig. 2 right). As time evolves, they appear\nmore frequently. At the final stage (Fig. 3(b)), the initially harmonic wave has become grossly\ndistorted (inset) and its period has increased substantially owing to subharmonic generation\n(main figure) with several spectral peaks appearing at frequencies below that of the driving force\n(arrowed). Such decay instabilities (especially threshold and near-threshold behaviour) have also\nbeen studied for e.g. spin waves [13, 14, 15], magnetohydrodynamic waves in plasma [16], and\ninteracting first and second sound waves in superfluid helium near the superfluid transition [17].\nA quite similar parametric process, but caused by 4-wave scattering (modulation instability), is\nthought to be responsible for the generation of large wind-driven ocean waves [18]. In this sense,\nour demonstration of leakage of energy towards lower frequencies can be regarded as evidence\nin favour of the suggestion by Dyachenko and Zakharov that rogue waves on the ocean build\nup through nonlinear wave interactions between ordinary wind-blown waves [18], which is an\nalternative to the recent suggestion [19] based on optical solitons that rogue waves may arise\nfrom scattering of nonlinear waves on a continuous noisy background.\nWe note that there are other contexts in which inverse energy cascades have been considered,\nincluding 2-dimensional incompressible liquids and Bose gases [20], and quantized vortices in\nHe II [21, 22]. To our knowledge, however, the present work represents the first experimental\nobservation of an inverse energy cascade in acoustic wave turbulence.\n25th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics (LT25) IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 150 (2009) 032056 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/150\/3\/032056\n3\n0.2\n0.0\n1.00.5\n \n \nT(\nt) \n(m\nK)\nt (ms)\n0.0\na)\n0.5 1.0 1.5\n3\n6\n0.0 0.5 1.0\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\nT(\nt) \n(m\nK)\n \n \n\/ d\nT\n x\n10\n2  (\nm\nK \ns)\nb)\n0\nt (ms)\n \n \n \n \nFigure 3.

Conclusion\nIn summary, we have exploited the special features of second sound to demonstrate that an\ninverse energy cascade can exist in acoustic wave turbulence, carrying energy towards lower\nfrequencies.\nThe work was supported by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK), the\nRussian Foundation for Basic Research, project No. 07-02-00728, and by the Presidium of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences under the programs \u201cQuantum Macrophysics\u201d and \u201cMathematical\nMethods in Nonlinear Dynamics\u201d.\nReferences\n[1] Tsoi V S 2003 CEJP 1 72\u201390\n[2] Gurbatov S N, Kurin V V, Kustov L M and Pronchatov-Rubtsov N V 2005 Acoust.
