It was his first attempt to challenge Michels\u2019 \u2018iron law of oligarchy\u2019 and would \nlead to a programme of research that that would culminate with the publication of the \nwidely admired classic study Union Democracy. Second, the inspiration for this work \ncame from Lipset\u2019s student days when he was a socialist activist trying to understand \nwhy leftist governments often failed to carry out substantial programmes of social \nreform. Third, although it was one of his earliest publications it bears all the hallmarks of \nthe work that would subsequently make Lipset a giant of political sociology: the \nenthusiasm for classic sociological problems; the appreciation of history; and the \ningenious use of the small n comparative approach. Finally, I would argue that Lipset\u2019s \nstudy of democracy within private government represents a missed opportunity for \nsociology though there are signs that this is being rectified in recent years. \nKeywords: oligarchy; union democracy; Lipset; socialism; comparative method; social \nscience. \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nWhen \u2018Democracy in Private Government: A Case Study of the International \nTypographical Union\u2019 was published in 1952 Seymour Martin (Marty) Lipset was a \nrelatively unknown young American scholar holding a research grant at the Institute of \nIndustrial Relations at the University of California. Though he had already completed a \nbook on agrarian socialism (Lipset 1950) and published papers in the Canadian Journal \nof Economics and Political Science (Lipset 1948) and the British Journal of Sociology \n(Lipset and Bendix 1951), there seemed little to suggest that the then thirty year old \nacademic would go on to become a towering figure in political sociology and political \nscience. Indeed, his interest in unusual social phenomena, such as agrarian socialist \ngovernment in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan (Lipset 1950) and democracy \nwithin a small craft-workers\u2019 union (International Typographical Union), along with his \npenchant for publishing in non-American journals, might have suggested a relatively \nundistinguished career in the making. Instead, as we now know, he would build a \nreputation as an expert on democracy, social stratification, and American exceptionalism, \nbecome one of the most heavily cited of all social scientists (Marks 2007), and have the \nunique distinction of being the only person to be elected president of both the American \nSociological Association (1992\u201393) and the American Political Science Association \n(1979\u201380). When he died in December, 2006, The Guardian described him as \u2018the \nleading theorist of democracy and American exceptionalism\u2019 (Marks 2007); The New \nYork Times as \u2018a pre-eminent sociologist, political scientist and incisive theorist of \nAmerican uniqueness\u2019 (Martin 2007); and The Washington Post as \u2018one of the most \ninfluential social scientists of the past half century\u2019 (Sullivan 2007).  \nThough \u2018Democracy in Private Government\u2019 has rarely been cited I would argue that \nit is of interest for at least four reasons. The first is that it was a preliminary paper from a \nbody of research that would eventually result in the much admired classic of mid-century \nAmerican sociology, Union Democracy (Lipset, Trow and Coleman 1956). Published in \n1956, Union Democracy was also responsible for helping to launch the careers of two \nother exceptional sociologists, Martin Trow, who would later make a name in the \nsociology of higher education, and, in particular, James Coleman who would go on to \nbecome at least as influential as the senior author and instigator of the project. \n 4 \nUnfortunately, for the British Journal of Sociology, future references to Lipset\u2019s research \non democracy within the International Typographical Union (ITU) would list the book \nrather than the earlier article, with the book eventually being declared a \u2018citation classic\u2019 \nby the ISI in 1988 (Lipset 1988). Even so, in his later years Lipset would write that he felt \nthat the research, especially its theoretical emphasis on what is now known as civil \nsociety, was rather neglected by those scholars who (re)discovered the relationship \nbetween democracy and civil society during the 1980s and 1990s. He suspected that the \nITU findings did not feed into this literature for two reasons: it was published back in the \n1950s; and it dealt with the unfashionable topic of trade unions (Lipset 2004: 186). \n \nFrom socialism to sociology \nThe second reason why the \u2018Private Government\u2019 paper is of interest is because it was \ninspired by the radical leftist politics of the 1930s and 1940s. Though Lipset was inspired \nby political values he was always a good Weberian in the sense that he continually sought \nto separate his values from his analysis, findings and conclusions. Nonetheless, his \nresearch had political intentions in that he wanted to resolve or, at least, contribute to \npolitical discussions of his time. The union democracy project, and much of his early \nwork, grew out of debates he had been involved in as a student when he was active in \nsocialist politics. Indeed, Lipset had, at one point, served as the national chairman of a \nTrotskyist organization called the Young People\u2019s Socialist League, which was the youth \nsection of the American Socialist party (Lipset 2004: 173). On entering City College, \nNew York, he would join a celebrated group of anti-Stalinist student radicals who would \neventually go on to become influential academics and public intellectuals. In addition to \nLipset, the group included such luminaries as Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer, Irving Howe, \nIrving Kristol, Philip Selznick and Peter Rossi (Lipset 2004: 177).2  \nIn his autobiographical essay \u2018Steady Work\u2019 Lipset relates how he and other members \nof this group became pre-occupied with the question of why Marxist and social \ndemocratic parties in a wide range of countries appeared to be more concerned with \ngaining and maintaining power than undertaking any kind of significant programme of \nsocial reform (Lipset 2004: 177-180). The most striking example for someone who grew \n 5 \nup in the 1930s was, of course, the Soviet Union where a Marxist inspired revolution \ncreated a ruling elite that was characterized more by dictatorship than democracy.  \nThe best explanation that Lipset could find for Stalinism and the failures of social \ndemocracy was Robert Michels Political Parties (Michels 1962 [1915]) , a book that had \nbeen recommended to him by a fellow student radical, Philip Selznick. Michels, a former \nstudent of Weber\u2019s set himself the task of resolving a common paradox: why is it that \ngroups or organizations that have been established, at least in part, to promote democratic \nvalues, should so often have leaders who hold their offices for \u2018life\u2019? Michels answer was \nthat oligarchic domination is inevitable within large-scale organizations regardless of \nhow democratic or autocratic they may have been when founded. In a now well-known \nquote, Michels proclaimed: \u2018It is organization which gives birth to the dominion of the \nelected over the electors, of the mandataries over the mandators, of the delegates over the \ndelegators. Who says organization, says oligarchy\u2019 (Michels 1962 [1915]: 365). \nAccording to Michels\u2019 theory, oligarchical tendencies arise within voluntary \nassociations, such as trade unions and political parties, because direct participation by \nevery member in every decision is simply not possible. \u2018Representative democracy\u2019 and \nthe demands of organization invariably produce a small group of leaders who enjoy high \nlevels of power, status, and income. The tragedy of these sometime radical leaders is that \nno matter how much they wish to promote \u2018democracy\u2019 they find it difficult to step aside \nand relinquish these privileges. Furthermore, in clinging to office they find that they can \ntake advantage of their position to fend off potential opponents. Specifically, they can use \ntheir office to make their views known, to give legitimacy to those views, and to control \nthe channels of communication within the organization. As a relatively small group, the \nleaders also find it easier to organize themselves into a cohesive group compared to their \nopponents who may often come from different sections of the membership. Finally, the \nleaders benefit from a phenomenon that Michels described as the apathy of the \u2018masses\u2019. \nFew members have any interest in organizational politics and those who do either have \nstrong feelings of gratitude towards the leaders or see little point in changing. \nThough often overlooked, Michels also described a second tendency. In their desire to \nremain in office, the leaders, and consequently the party, frequently become more \nconservative in nature. The original goals of the party, for instance, become more modest, \n 6 \npartly because of a natural tendency for operational goals to supplant purposive or \npolitical ones. Similarly, the tactics of the party or union become less radical as leaders \ndo not wish to risk high office through spectacular defeats. What was particularly striking \nfor young socialists was the fact that Michels had based his observations on the German \nSocial Democratic Party. If the \u2018iron law\u2019 held for a political party that valued \ndemocratization then Michels had all the more reason to proclaim a universal law that \nheld across the political spectrum.  \nThough Lipset was greatly impressed by Political Parties he happened to be familiar \nwith a trade union that was a striking counter-example to oligarchical rule. This union, \nwhich happened to be his father\u2019s International Typographical Union (ITU), had a \ncompetitive two party political system that led to regular changes in the leadership. In a \nrevealing essay on the Union Democracy project Lipset recalls how his father, a printer \nand life-long union member, would take his young son along to monthly meetings of the \nNew York local (Lipset 1964a). Lengthy discussions about union politics were also a \nfeature of the Lipset household (Velasco 2004: 585).  Being intimately familiar with the \nworkings of the ITU Lipset was able to turn this knowledge into a paper on why the \u2018iron \nlaw of oligarchy\u2019 was not a \u2018law\u2019 for a course on social organization led by one of the \ngiants of American sociology, Robert K. Merton.  \nFortunately for Lipset, Merton was impressed by the paper and it subsequently became \nthe main part of his application for a fellowship that enabled him to finish his PhD at \nColumbia University without having to seek outside employment. It was this paper that \nwas subsequently extended and published in the British Journal of Sociology in 1952 \n(Lipset 1964a: 99-100). An even longer version of this historically-oriented material, \nincluding the table on election returns, appeared in chapter 3 of the subsequent Union \nDemocracy book. \nIn sum, Lipset\u2019s research on trade union democracy, and, indeed, his earlier work on \nagrarian socialism in Canada, was motivated by his background in socialist politics \n(Lipset 1994: 200). Like others of his generation he would gradually make the transition \nfrom socialism to sociology. By the mid-1950s Lipset had lost his enthusiasm for \nsocialism along with many others who lived through the Second World War, the \nHolocaust, Fascism, and Stalinism (Velasco 2004: 589-590). His fellow student at City \n 7 \nCollege, Nathan Glazer, who would also make the same journey remarked that \u2018in the \nmid- and late 1940s there was something about sociology \u2013 for those of us who were \nsocialists and were becoming sociologists \u2013 that undermined faith\u2019 (Glazer 1990: 190-\n191). Whatever the reason, Lipset\u2019s early work was much too sophisticated, both in terms \nof theory and method, to wither in the same way as his socialism. \n \nLipsetian analysis \nThe third reason for revisiting \u2018Democracy in Private Government\u2019 is because it shows \nmany of the trademarks that would subsequently be associated with Lipset\u2019s work: his \nfondness for the sociological classics; his appreciation of history; and his ingenious use \nof the small n comparative approach to social research. Lipset\u2019s enthusiasm for the \nclassics was far from being the kind of exegetical approach associated with that strand of \nsocial theory concerned with the history of ideas. Although he admired Michels\u2019 work, \nLipset\u2019s interest was really in classic sociological problems rather than authors. \nFurthermore, he also had a remarkable talent for identifying and persisting with \ntheoretically and socially meaningful questions that could be made the subject of \nempirical research.3 \nLipset\u2019s orientation to sociological theory was emphatically of the \u2018middle-range\u2019 kind \nrecommended by his mentor and former teacher, Robert Merton. For Merton, the \nprincipal use of middle-range theory in sociology is to guide empirical inquiry. Though \nmiddle-range theory involves abstractions, these are capable of being turned into \npropositions that can be tested through the use of empirical evidence. Yet each theory is \nmore than a mere empirical generalization or an isolated proposition that identifies a \nrelationship between two or more variables. Middle-range theory is, in the end, a set of \nassumptions from which logically related sets of propositions can be derived to explain \nempirical uniformities (Merton 1968: 39-41). When viewed in these terms, Union \nDemocracy is a classic example of middle-range theory. \nTowards the end of \u2018Democracy and Private Government\u2019 Lipset lists a number of \nfactors that \u2018make for a competition of alternative governments\u2019 including \u2018the existence \nwithin the larger locals of a large number of private social and athletic clubs which \nprovide independent sources of power and influence, and opportunities for the training of \n 8 \nnew leadership\u2019 (Lipset 1952: 58). This feature of the ITU would be given much greater \nprominence in the book where it became part of an extended analysis of the role of the \nprinters\u2019 \u2018occupational community\u2019. Using survey data, Lipset et al. found that the \nirregular hours of work (often night work) and their marginal social status (on the border \nbetween the white-collar middle class and the manual working class) led them to \nsocialize together outside of work. This resulted in the creation of an ITU occupational \ncommunity based around printers\u2019 clubs and associations (such as baseball leagues, \nbowling groups, veterans\u2019 organizations, ethnic associations, newspapers etc). In addition \nto providing budding union officials with political skills, these subgroups also served to \nfoster links between the printers, the union and the two factions through regular meetings \nand the circulation of newsletters (Lipset, Trow and Coleman 1956: 106-140; 145-150; \n365-371). \nIn developing the argument about the relationship between voluntary organizations \nand politics Lipset and his colleagues drew on another classic foundational text in \nsociology, namely Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America. (de Tocqueville 1966 \n[1835]) At that time Tocqueville was also examining a unique case, the democratic, post-\nrevolutionary republic known as the USA. In trying to understand why democracy took \nhold in the United States in a way that it had not in France, Tocqueville emphasized the \nrole of \u2018secondary powers\u2019 \u2013 institutions that were independent of the state and served to \nencourage political involvement, communication, and the generation of new ideas. \nCrucially, these institutions enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and, as the evidence on \nthe ITU Locals indicated, they provided fertile ground for opposition groups who wished \nto (re)build their organization, recruit and train new leaders, and even provide a \ncompeting record of office. Today, these points are widely recognized in discussions of \ncivil society and the role that it plays in both fostering democracy and acting as a bulwark \nagainst totalitarianism. Sadly, as Lipset noted, Union Democracy\u2019s pioneering empirical \nanalysis of this topic remains strangely neglected (see Lipset, Trow and Coleman 1956: \n74-82). \nNone the less, the essential point is that it was social theory that initiated the research, \ngenerated the hypotheses and helped to explain the results. Coleman, who began the \nproject as a PhD student, would later write that one of the things he learned from working \n 9 \nwith Lipset was that theory and evidence come together only if one starts with a problem \nand then uses that to sort the data. In elaborating on the point Coleman noted that one of \nthe distinguishing features of the research was the use in the book of the then new \nmethods of quantitative analyses. Although statistical analyses appear throughout Union \nDemocracy it was, according to Coleman, \u2018the framework of ideas from social theory\u2019 \nthat generated the hypotheses (Coleman 1992: 95).  \n \nAn appreciation of history \n\u2018Democracy in Private Government\u2019 is distinctly historical in orientation. Much of the \nearly part of the paper is spent detailing the origins of the two major factions within the \nITU, the Progressives and the Independents. Both had their origins in secret societies that \nemerged within the union shortly after it was founded in 1850. The societies sought to \npreserve the union at a time when there was large-scale unemployment among printers, \nwhen activists were being fired, and when union members betrayed each other for the \nsake of a steady job. Over time they sought to place their members in positions of \ninfluence to prevent employer spies and lukewarm union members from diluting union \ngoals. Following some splits in the 1920s, the opposing factions formed two parties and \nthe secret societies were dissolved.  \nThe major divide between the two parties was over the degree of militancy in union \ntactics. The Independents advocated a conciliatory approach in dealings with employers \nwhile the Progressives were more likely to favour strikes and other forms of industrial \naction. As Lipset noted, this division was of theoretical significance because its very \nexistence challenged Michels\u2019 claim that political parties and unions had a tendency \ntowards oligarchy and, consequently, conservatism. In other words, the tendency towards \n\u2018bureaucratic conservatism\u2019 was held in check by the presence of an opposition party \nready to seize on any error made by the incumbent leaders.  Moreover, Lipset argued that \nthere are occasions when union leaders have to act radically rather than conservatively \nbecause, in his view, the \u2018law\u2019 of organization is not conservatism but survival. Drawing \non historical examples, Lipset noted how the Independents were voted out of office after \nthe Second World War because they had given a conciliatory reaction to the restrictions \nof the War Labor Board. By contrast, the Progressives responded with increased \n 10 \nmilitancy when faced with the restrictions of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 (Lipset 1952: \n59). \nLipset\u2019s use of historical evidence in \u2018Private Government\u2019 was partly to make a \ngeneral theoretical point and partly to provide a greater understanding of how the two \nparty systems emerged in the ITU. The latter is significant because Lipset would not let \nthe need for theoretical generalities prevent him from drawing attention to historical \nspecifics when he set himself the task of understanding a particular social phenomenon. \nLike Tocqueville, Lipset also recognized the importance of understanding the \u2018point of \ndeparture\u2019. For Tocqueville, it was the arrival of the English colonialists with their laws, \ncustoms, and religion that set the mould for the future of American democracy. For \nLipset, it was the secret societies of the mid-nineteenth century that laid the foundations \nfor the two party system of the twentieth century. \nLipset\u2019s use of history in \u2018Democracy and Private Government\u2019 was the first of many \noccasions when he would stress the importance of the historical starting point. The First \nNew Nation, for instance, starts in the eighteen century and examines the role of George \nWashington and other founder figures, in addition to the typical Lipsetian focus on \nstructural factors (Lipset 1964b). Washington, for instance, helped institutionalize the \ndemocratic process as president by remaining above controversy and by setting an \nimportant precedent in retiring from office without having been defeated. Similarly, his \nlater work on American exceptionalism included history alongside social, economic and \npolitical factors when it emphasized the role of the American revolution in promoting \nindividualistic and anti-statist values (Lipset 1990; Lipset 1996). \n \nThe importance of comparison \nThe ITU study has been widely praised for its research design, which is often cited as a \nclassic example of what can be achieved with a single or \u2018deviant\u2019 case (George and \nBennett 2005: 215-6; Rueschemeyer 2003: 308-9; Yin 2003: 43-44). Where a theory is \nstated in deterministic terms, such as Michels\u2019 \u2018iron law of oligarchy\u2019, a single exception, \nsuch as the ITU, can prove the theory wrong (Mahoney 2007: 125; Rueschemeyer 2003: \n310). Furthermore, such deviant cases may also be used to understand the reasons why \nthey do not conform to the existing theory and, ideally, generate hypotheses for further \n 11 \nresearch. Significantly, this argument has become quite important for those who wish to \nretain a role for qualitative or small n studies within the social sciences at a time when \nquantitative or large n approaches appear to be in the ascendancy (e.g., Rueschemeyer \n2003).4 \n However, a common misconception about the ITU case is that the authors used it to \nrefute Michels\u2019 iron law (e.g., Hakim 2000: 61). Certainly, the \u2018Private Government\u2019 \npaper claimed that: \u2018\u2026the \u201ciron law of oligarchy\u201d as Michels presented it is not a \u201claw\u201d \n(Lipset 1952: 59). Yet both the paper and the book go on to argue that oligarchy is \nendemic in large-scale organization and while there might be  \n \n\u2026much more variation in the internal organization of associations than the \nnotion of an iron law of oligarchy would imply\u2026 the implications of our \nanalysis for democratic organizational politics are almost as pessimistic as \nthose postulated by Robert Michels. (Lipset, Trow and Coleman 1956: 405).  \n \nHere they emphasized some, but not all, of the original factors listed by Michels: the \noverwhelming power held by the incumbent officers (e.g., over financial resources and \ninternal communication); the low levels of interest among ordinary union members; and \nthe reluctance of leaders to give up positions of high status, power, and income. \nAlthough Lipset acknowledged that he spent much of his career investigating \u2018left \nwing outliers\u2019 (Lipset 2004: 198), such as the ITU, his understanding of these deviant \ncases showed him to be a master of what political scientists call the small n comparative \nmethod.  His underlying logic was essentially that of the \u2018most similar systems design\u2019 \n(Przeworski and Teune 1982) in that he sought to compare cases that shared a range of \ncommon features, in an effort to hold some factors constant, while highlighting other \ndifferent or unique features that were associated with the phenomenon he was trying to \nexplain. This characteristically Lipsetian approach is, of course, now well-known through \nhis work on American exceptionalism. To explain, for instance, why the US had different \npatterns of governance and class relations he compared it to other English-speaking \nformer colonies of Great Britain (Lipset 1964b; Lipset 1996).  In seeking to explain the \nold Werner Sombart question of why the USA never had a mainstream socialist party he \ncompared it with its near neighbour Canada which has a long and vibrant history of \n 12 \ndemocratic socialism (Lipset and Marks 2000; Sombart 1976). For Lipset, the value of \nthis approach was that it enabled him to better understand his own country by showing \nwhere it was similar to and how it differed from other countries. In a succinct and much \ncited methodological directive he said: \u2018those who know only one country know no \ncountry\u2019 (Lipset 1996: 17).  \nThe comparative method also makes a brief but highly effective appearance in \n\u2018Democracy in Private Government\u2019. In a wonderful example of the difference between \nsocial scientific thinking and \u2018common sense\u2019 he first asked members of the ITU why it \nhad a two-party system when most other unions did not. Their response was that it was \neither due to the historic traditions of chapel and union democracy or because the printers \nwere relatively highly educated compared to other craft unions. Lipset then proceeds to \nargue on the basis of a \u2018control\u2019 or comparable case that both hypotheses were wrong. \nThe \u2018control\u2019 was the International Pressmen\u2019s Union (IPU) which had originally been \npart of the Typographical union in the nineteenth century and shared the same historical \ntraditions and institutions, such as chapels. Furthermore, they worked alongside the ITU \nmembers in print shops across the USA, had similar personal characteristics, and earned \nbroadly similar wages. But rather than having similar levels of internal democracy Lipset \nreports that the International Pressmen\u2019s Union was \u2018one of the most dictatorial unions in \nAmerica\u2019. One IPU group of leaders, for instance, held office in the union for more than \nthirty years until its more prominent members died. Another was repeatedly elected \nwithout opposition while many locals were denied the right to chose their own officers \nand some locals were even suspended for opposing the policies of the leaders (Lipset \n1952: 55-56). With these simple observations Lipset demolished the commonsensical \nexplanations put forward by his subjects. As an analytical strategy, it was based on \nnothing more than judicious comparison with a comparable case. Yet it would, none the \nless, be a strategy that he would repeat in Union Democracy (Lipset, Trow and Coleman \n1956: 395-399) and, indeed, to great effect throughout his distinguished career. \n \nThe fall and rise of research on union democracy \nIt is quite possible that the sociology of trade unionism and industrial relations had its \n\u2018Golden Age\u2019 in the first two decades after World War II. In the US, James Coleman, \n 13 \nAlvin Gouldner, Seymour Martin Lipset, C. Wright Mills, Martin Trow and William F. \nWhyte were among the sociologists, now known primarily for contributions in other \nareas, who were studying trade unions during this period (Strauss 1977: 216). Within \nBritain, Joe Banks, Bob Blackburn, A. H. (Chelly) Halsey, David Lockwood and Michael \nMann began their careers with studies of workers, trade unions, and industrial relations \nbefore moving on to other subjects for which they are better known. Of course, this could \nbe interpreted as meaning that the subject of industrial relations is in decline and that \ntrade unionism is no longer of interest to young economic sociologists, possibly because \nit is no longer at the forefront of public attention in the way that it was in the postwar era.  \nIndeed, as I indicated earlier, Lipset himself also claimed that the civil society type \nargument presented in Union Democracy may have been neglected in part because it was \nbased on a study of trade unions. However, I would also argue that it reflects a failing in \nsociology as a social science. Science advances through the development, testing and \nrevision of theoretically derived hypotheses and, ultimately, through the steady, \nincremental accumulation of knowledge. Union Democracy was a path-breaking and \nprovocative study that ought to have been succeeded by a series of studies that would \nhave identified the conditions associated with oligarchy, democracy and possibly even \ndictatorship, in other kinds of voluntary organizations. Instead, it was left on a pedestal, \nwidely admired, but rarely imitated. Others have speculated on the reasons for this failing \nin sociology and it may be that sociologists neither refute, refine or confirm ideas; \ninstead, they become bored with them and move onto the next \u2018hot topic\u2019  (see also Davis \n1994: 180-181). By contrast, the topic has fared much better in political science where \nthere is now an extensive literature on the distribution of power within political parties \n(e.g., Kavanagh 1985; McKenzie 1955). \nThe few studies of trade unions that did appear during the 1960s and 1970s followed \nLipset and colleagues in focusing on participation rates, closeness of elections and the \nexistence of factions or parties within unions (see, for instance, Anderson 1978; Edelstein \nand Warner 1975; Martin 1968). Of these, the most influential was Edelstein and \nWarner\u2019s analysis of elections in the largest British and American unions which found \nthat the incumbent leaders rarely lost elections. Though they identified the potential for \ndemocratic practice in union constitutions, especially where they lead to the dispersal or \n 14 \ndecentralization of power, Edelstein and Warner acknowledged that few unions \nresembled the democratic ITU (Edelstein and Warner 1975).  \nA small number of Marxist scholars, notably in Britain, took up the related question of \nbureaucratic conservatism among union leaders. In contrast to Lipset and colleagues who \nemphasized the way internal bureaucratic pressures led union leaders to adopt \nconservative positions, Marxists emphasized external factors, such as the influence of \nemployers, the state and the capitalist system generally. According to the Marxist \nperspective, as union leaders focus on economic goals, or so-called \u2018business unionism\u2019, \nthey inevitably act to control their members on behalf of their employers by limiting their \naspirations for change. The result is that unions may be more concerned with stabilizing \nthe details of the relationship between labour and capital than with conducting a struggle \nagainst the domination of capital (Hyman 1975: 91). This argument gained some \nattention during the 1980s when Richard Hyman\u2019s \u2018bureaucratization of the rank and file\u2019 \nthesis led to a minor debate among British industrial relations researchers. Hyman \nclaimed that from the late 1960s onwards British shop stewards increasingly acted in \nways that contained as well as encouraged members\u2019 militancy (Hyman 1979: 57-60). By \ncontrast, Eric Batstone argued that Hyman\u2019s thesis was based on limited evidence and \nthat there was, in fact, little change from the early 1960s up until the 1980s (Batstone \n1988: 92-93). Since then, academic interest in the question of bureaucratic conservatism \nhas waned even among industrial relations scholars who have instead been trying to \nunderstand the dramatic decline in trade union organization and membership since the \nlate 1970s (McGovern et al. 2007: 109-112). \nHowever, the topic of union democracy itself has re-emerged in the past couple of \ndecades starting initially in Britain before gaining the attention of a new generation of \nsociologists and political scientists in the USA. Somewhat ironically, the revival of \nBritish interest in a subject that was once so dear to socialists in the 1940s and 1950s \nowes much to the actions of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s neo-liberal Conservative governments. \nDuring the 1980s, Thatcher\u2019s governments set out to tame the unions partly by making \nthem more democratic so that the more ideologically motivated and militant leftist \nleaders would be reigned in by the more instrumentally minded members. Accordingly, a \nseries of Acts of Parliament were introduced to regulate their rights, responsibilities and \n 15 \ninternal governance of trade unions. Rod Martin, one of the few British sociologists to \nretain a long-term interest in union democracy, undertook detailed assessments of the \neffects of this legislation with Roger Undy and other colleagues (Undy et al. 1996; Undy \nand Martin 1984). They found that it increased membership participation in some unions \nbut generally failed to either encourage or discourage factional organization (Undy et al. \n1996: 243). Furthermore, union government has not become more democratic, in the \nsense of being more capable of representing the interests of individual members. If \nanything, the effect has been neutral (Martin et al. 1995: 154). \nThe resurgence of interest in union democracy among American social scientists has, \nhowever, identified several further \u2018deviant cases\u2019 from the \u2018iron law\u2019 (see, for example, \nCornfield 1989; Levi et al. 2009; Voss and Sherman 2000). Perhaps the most significant \nfinding from this research is that the goals and tactics of unions previously considered \noligarchical and conservative can be transformed in a radical direction. Essential \nelements of this transformation are the election of leaders with a more aggressive \napproach to union organizing, a change in organizational culture, and sustained pressure \nfor change from the top of the union. Remarkably, this new social movement-oriented \nform of trade unionism seems better equipped to recruit new members, mobilize workers \nand engage in alternative and effective forms of industrial action including high-profile \npublic demonstrations (Voss and Sherman 2000). Although still only a handful of cases, \nso-called social movement or community-oriented trade unions have been hailed as the \nmost promising possibility for the revitalization of the labour movement in Britain as \nwell as the USA (Voss and Sherman 2000; Wills 2001). One can imagine that Lipset \nwould have been quite intrigued by such \u2018left wing anomalies\u2019. \n \n(Date accepted:  August 2009) \n \n 16 \n \nBibliography 1 \nAnderson, John C. 1978. \"A Comparative Analysis of Local Union Democracy.\" Industrial 2 \nRelations 17:278-295. 3 \nBatstone, Eric. 1988.
