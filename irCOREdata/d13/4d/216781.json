Despite it initially seeming pivotal to New Labour\u2019s reform of policing and\nthe antecedent of a new race equality agenda, it has remained a contested concept that has\nbeen critiqued by multiple constituencies. This paper notes the ambiguities and contradictions\nof the concept and considers its validity as an explanatory concept for long-observed ethnic\ninequalities in educational attainment and stop and search. In so doing, it argues for its retention,\nbut only within a multilevel framework that incorporates racialisations operating at the micro,\nmeso and macro levels.\nIntroduction\nMore than 25 years ago, the sociologist David Mason (1982) warned that the term\n\u2018institutional racism\u2019 would forever be a political slogan lacking in analytical\nrigour until it could be more precisely conceptualised, theorised and subjected\nto empirical investigation. The concept first appeared in the radical writings\nof US black political activists, Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton in\nBlack Power (1968). Institutional racism, it was argued, was deeply embedded\nin established conventions in US society, which relied on anti-black attitudes of\ninferiority, even if individual whites did not themselves discriminate against\nindividual blacks. An illustration used was the high infant mortality rates\nof black babies resulting from insufficient nutrition, inadequate housing and\npoor healthcare in black neighbourhoods, which effectively operated as internal\ncolonies. For Mason, this conceptualisation failed to provide a clear theoretical\nbasis for specifying the mechanisms through which institutional rather than\nindividual racism operated to disadvantage certain groups over others. Mason\n(1982: 44) called instead for the theoretical tools to explain \u2018the interplay of social\nstructures and human action, material conditions and ideas\u2019 which could then\nbe subjected to empirical evaluation (see also Miles, 1989; Ginsburg, 1988).\nAlthough institutional racism was rejected as a reason for the fractured\npolice\u2013minority ethnic relations in Scarman\u2019s (1981) Report into the Brixton\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n174 coretta phillips\nDisorders, by the end of the 1990s the term had re-emerged, becoming part\nof mainstream political discourse when it was used to brand the Metropolitan\nPolice Service for its failed investigation into Stephen Lawrence\u2019s racist murder\n(Macpherson, 1999). It provided a spur to a major reform of policing and race\nequality measures, although its validity was contested by sections of the right-\nwing press and Civitas (see for example Dennis et al., 2000), and was vehemently\nrejected by front-line police officers who interpreted it as meaning that\nindividual racism within the police service was widespread (Foster et al., 2005).\nSimilarly, academics remained sceptical because of the Macpherson definition\u2019s\nconflation of individual and institutional racism (Anthias, 1999; Bourne, 2001;\nMiles and Brown, 2003; Solomos, 1999). For Wight (2003), for example, it\nfailed to differentiate between institutional racism as outcome and cause,\nrecognising the agential overt and unwitting practices of individuals but not the\ninteracting causal structural conditions (see also Bourne, 2001; Lea, 2000; Bridges,\n2000).\nThe first part of this paper argues that, despite these conceptual ambiguities,\ninstitutional racism can be retained to assist our understanding of persistent\nethnic inequalities in key areas of social policy. However, institutional racism\nneeds to be situated within a conceptual framework which acknowledges the role\nof racialisation at the micro, meso and macro levels, and cannot serve as the sole\nexplanation for the ethnically disparate welfare outcomes that have long been\nobserved. In the second section of the paper, this multilevel framework (which\nincludes institutional racialisation) is applied to explain ethnic1 inequalities in\neducation (attainment) and policing (stop-and-search practices). The paper\nconcludes with a brief discussion of the possible intervention points which may\ncontribute to the elimination of ethnic inequalities at the micro, meso and macro\nlevels.\nRattansi (2005) has advocated using the concept of racialisation2 and\ninstitutional racialisation instead of racism. There are both conceptual and\npolitical advantages to adopting this conceptualisation. Analytically, according\nto Rattansi, racialisation provides a multi-layered and multi-dimensional frame.\nIt can encapsulate statements which explicitly denigrate or assume the inferiority\nof racialised groups as well as the more implicit common sense understandings\nwhich exist within institutions. Its dynamic, as opposed to static nature, allows the\nintersections of race with class, gender, sexuality and nation to be incorporated\ninto any empirical investigation, as the following example (Rattansi, 2005: 290)\nmakes clear:\nJudgements about the suitability of families wanting housing or waiting to be rehoused contain\nelements of norms that are classed, raced, and gendered. \u2018Gatekeepers\u2019, white or non-white\nare usually middle class and deploy criteria of acceptability such as cleanliness, style of de\u00b4cor,\nbehaviour of children, size of family, the deportment of the mother, which can work against\nwhite working class, black, and Asian families.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\ninstitutional racism and ethnic inequalities 175\nIn this regard, it accommodates intersectional understandings which recognise\nthe significance of seeing individuals as multiply positioned, with each identity\n(race\/ethnicity, gender or class) irreducible to a discrete category or experience.\nThese multiple axes of differentiation and interacting levels of disadvantage\nand discrimination produce complex social relations (Crenshaw, 1993; Brah\nand Phoenix, 2009). Analytically, such an approach can also better appreciate\ninternal differentiation which avoids essentialising experience and recognises its\nhistorically and spatially contingent nature.\nPerhaps, most importantly, politically, institutional racialisation could neatly\navoid the perceived binary essence of racism and its deeply polarising effect. Policy\nofficials and lay audiences alike may be more accepting of an explanation of ethnic\ninequalities in welfare outcomes that is less closely associated with intentionality\nand motivation, and less blaming, as Foster et al.\u2019s (2005) study of defensive police\nattitudes suggested.\nWhat follows is a reframing which accommodates the need to account\nfor individuals\u2019 roles in implementing regulations, procedures and policies\nwhich produce unequal outcomes for particular racial and ethnic groups. It\nemploys a multilevel framework which considers the complex configurations\nof identities, discrimination and outcomes at three discrete but intersecting\nand overlapping levels: micro, meso and macro.3 Existing conceptualisations\nof institutional racialisation would place it at the meso level, with micro-\nlevel racialisation constituted by individual-level practices and interactions.\nMacro-level racialisation takes into account structural forces beyond individual\npractices and institutional processes. Such an account recognises, nonetheless,\nthat institutional processes are developed, formulated and implemented by\nindividuals constrained or enabled by structural factors (see also Cole, 2004;\nGiddens, 1984). Thus, racialisation and inequalities are produced and reproduced\nat each of these levels in interaction.\nThe objective of a multilevel approach is to more clearly specify the\nmechanisms and interacting processes through which ethnic inequalities are\nreproduced and sustained in a cumulative fashion. In so doing, our conceptual\nand theoretical understanding of racialisation is enhanced, thus making a\ncontribution to a discipline which has not centrally located race, ethnicity and\nracism in its theoretical field (F. Williams, 1989). It also seeks to counter the\nconfusion engendered by the elision of individual and institutional forms of\nracialisation contained in the Macpherson Report (1999), and enunciate the\npoints at which intervention is required at the level of policy and service provision.\nRacialisation at the micro, meso and macro levels\nMicro level\nIt would be a nonsense to argue that individual prejudice and racialised\ndiscrimination are not still a part of the postcolonial condition. Even\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n176 coretta phillips\ncommentators such as Gilroy (2005: 438), who see multicultural conviviality\nas a defining feature of urban Britain, accept the continued presence of racism\nin Britain. Micro social theories which consider interpretative meaning in the\nsocial interactions of everyday life can illuminate micro-level racialisation. Face-\nto-face encounters and recognising the agential element of individual action\nhas traditionally been considered within an interactionist framework, with\nphenomenological approaches attending to subjective views of reality, rather\nthan objective factors (Roberts, 2006). As Lal (1995) has observed, processual\nunderstandings of race and ethnicity emphasise their historical and spatial\ncontext, and look to how culture is communicated between members through\nsocialisation and interactive experience. Such ideas permeated the work of\nthe Chicago School of Sociology\u2019s work on immigrants\u2019 and Southern blacks\u2019\nadjustment to city life, which also examined the social distance and spatial\ndistribution of ethnic groups (Park, 1967).\nSocial psychological research into prejudice and racism has pointed towards\nthe significance of the social and cultural normative climate in which dominant\ningroups (the white majority) express prejudiced attitudes, which in turn\ncontribute to a positive self-identity (Terry et al., 2001). Studies of racist violence\nindicate that individual perpetrators operate within families and communities\nthat implicitly endorse racialised prejudice and ethnic hatred (see, for example,\nSibbitt, 1997). Undoubtedly, some individuals working within welfare settings\nwill have been exposed to, and have internalised views consistent with, what has\nbeen referred to as the \u2018new racism\u2019, where egalitarian ideals can co-exist with\nan anti-Black affect that causes anxiety, distrust, fear and hostility (Augoustinos\nand Reynolds, 2001). Such approaches also recognise the inherent ambivalence\nof prejudice where individuals may hold both positive and negative attitudes\ntowards minority ethnic groups, which may explain the complex nature of the\nlink between racist attitudes and discriminatory behaviour (Terry et al., 2001;\nPettigrew and Meertens, 1995).\nMicro-level racialisation, then, is inextricably framed by the influence of\nfamilial socialisation and shared cultural values which are manifest in individuals\npositioned within various ethnic, classed and gendered groups. These are\nthemselves shifting rather than static, shaping and shaped by interactions\nwith other identity groups, and influenced significantly by local environmental\nconditions.\nMeso level\nBuilding on this further, the meso-analytical level is particularly concerned\nwith situating and contextualising factors which are temporally and spatially\nspecific. In this middle-range of theorising, the following can be considered,\nalthough this is by no means an exhaustive list: (i) socio-economic disadvantage;\n(ii) neighbourhood composition and effects; (iii) political, media and popular\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\ninstitutional racism and ethnic inequalities 177\ndiscourses; (iv) political incorporation and empowerment; and (v) institutional\nprocesses and practices.\nA focus on socio-economic disadvantage and class has always been central to\nsocial policy\u2019s epicentre of work examining poverty, inequality and redistribution.\nSocial policy analysts have also considered neighbourhood-level processes and the\nspecific composition of communities, acknowledging the area-based experience\nof social, economic and political inequality (see for example Lupton, 2003a).\nThe Chicago School of Sociology\u2019s more qualitative influence in analysing the\ndynamics of community interaction, social order and institutional arrangements,\noften at the neighbourhood level, also operates in this range of theorising. Political\nengagement has similarly been understood as a key dimension whose absence has\nbeen defined as a marker of social exclusion in a democratic society (Burchardt\net al., 2002).\nPolitical, media and popular discourses addressing race\/ethnicity, inequality\nand racism often contribute to \u2018commonsense\u2019 understandings of social life,\nwhich inform processes of micro-level racialisation. Migrationary flows into\nboth urban and rural areas, for example, have been accompanied by sentiments\ncarefully concealed in ministers\u2019 speeches, political statements and policy\ndocuments which underline racial Otherness and project multiple negative\ntraits on to unwelcome migrants and asylum-seekers who are viewed as\nwelfare-dependent opportunists, rather than as potential economically profitable\ncontributors (Schuster and Solomos, 2004). Such discourses combine with the\npolitics of resentment (Ware, 2008) centred on the perceived unequal distribution\nof resources to favour minority ethnic groups and more recently concerns\nabout Islamic terrorism. Psycho-social understandings recognise the affective and\nemotional component of racism, which is represented as threat, pollution and\ncontamination by racial Others who are blamed for structural changes relating\nto deindustrialisation, economic inequality, housing shortage, immigration and\nfractured communities (Hoggett, 1992). Together such views build on anxieties\nabout both the cultural cohesion of the nation and the believed compromises\nrequired by multiculturalism (McGhee, 2005).\nFinally, institutional racialisation recognises cumulative disadvantage\nexperienced across interrelated welfare experiences (housing, education,\nemployment and so on), produced through institutions\u2019 routine operations,\nregardless of the intentionality of individual actors (J. Williams, 1985).\nMacro level\nStructural determinants of material conditions provide the frame through\nwhich institutional processes and practices at the meso level are enacted.\nGlobalising forces, which have produced fundamental changes in the mode of\neconomic production, transnational politics and the unequal distribution of\nresources, structure social relations in Britain as elsewhere. Major demographic\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n178 coretta phillips\nchanges wrought by migration flows within and between North and South states\nhave resulted in diverse social groups seeking welfare services.\nThe nature of welfare more broadly, and housing, education and\nemployment specifically, have also been transformed in the post-industrialised\nlate modern world. Deindustrialisation, technological change, casualisation and\npart-time working, educational credentialism, marketisation, increased owner-\noccupation, the residualisation of social housing, the rise of the consumer\/client,\nand entrenched inequalities of wealth, income and power have all influenced the\ncontext in which social welfare is provided and services are delivered. Added to\nthis, the neo-liberal stamp of decentralised governance and public managerialism\nhave dramatically altered the way in which public sector organisations are\nmanaged, which is then translated in front-line operational practices.\nGoldberg\u2019s (2001) insights on the formation of the modern racial state are\nalso valuable for our interpretive understanding at the macro level. Through\nits apparatuses, modern states, it is argued, shaped articulations of race and\nracist exclusion, through definition, regulation, management, economic controls\nand the mediation of social relations. Ethnic monitoring, the surveillance and\ncriminalisation of racially identified populations, their limited access to economic\nresources and the extent to which such groups interacted, all served the modern\nracial state. Imbibed within political and popular culture, such expressions of\nrace (typically hierarchical) are deeply rooted in Enlightenment thinking (Eze,\n1997), and are acted upon, albeit reflexively, within institutions.\nEthnic inequalities in education and stop and search4 practices in\nEngland: analysing the contemporary picture\nIn order to move the discussion beyond abstraction, what follows is a speculative\nexploration of how racialisation operating interactively at the micro, meso and\nmacro levels might assist our understanding of ethnic inequalities. I shall discuss\ntwo illustrative examples drawn from the English context: educational attainment\nat the end of compulsory education and police use of stop and search.\nTable 1 shows the levels of attainment for different ethnic groups by gender\nin 2008. Children of Chinese, Indian and Mixed White and Asian origin perform\nat the highest levels with the most five A\u2217\u2212C passes at GCSE level. In contrast,\nchildren of Irish Traveller and Gypsy\/Roma heritage have very low levels of\nattainment, and those of Black Caribbean, Mixed White and Black Caribbean\nand Other Black origins also have fewer gaining the standard measure. The table\nalso reveals the out-performance of boys by girls in all ethnic groups.\nThe explanatory frameworks proposed to explicate these differential\noutcomes have included variants of socio-economic\/class disadvantage and\nteacher\/school racism, which can be placed within the micro-meso-macro\nframework. Before doing this, it is necessary to consider David Gillborn\u2019s thesis\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\ninstitutional racism and ethnic inequalities 179\nTABLE 1.

Historical discrimination\nagainst minority ethnic groups has been institutionalised so that even when\ncontemporary barriers to equality are removed, persistent inequality remains.\nGillborn\u2019s attention is specifically focused on educational practices, such\nas setting, coaching and examination tiering, which it is argued cumulatively\ndisadvantage black pupils. Allocated to lower sets in maths, black pupils are\nthen more likely to be entered into the Foundation tier for maths and English\ncompared with their white counterparts. This amounts to a crucial lowering of\nacademic possibilities, as pupils cannot be awarded higher grades which facilitate\naccess to higher education and professional careers. This led Gillborn (2008: 97) to\nforcefully argue that \u2018[i]t is difficult to think of a clearer example of institutional\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n180 coretta phillips\nracism than a test, disproportionately taken by Black students, in which the\nhighest possible grade is commonly judged to be a \u201cfailure\u201d\u2019.\nValuably, Gillborn (2008) also draws our attention to the way in which\nprevious \u2018knowledge\u2019 about educational attainment in pre-school children, which\nshowed black pupils to be performing well (using baseline assessments), has been\n\u2018rewritten\u2019. Instead, using the Foundation Stage Profile, which is based on teacher\njudgements, lower levels of early achievement among black pupils have been\nrecorded. The enormity of this is self-evident: policy discourse now assumes a\nstatic level of black underachievement all through the education system, which\ndeflects attention away from the role of the school in contributing to ethnic\ninequalities in education.\nGillborn\u2019s (2008) powerful insight into contemporary processes of schooling\nthat reproduce and sustain inequality can be complemented by teasing out\npractices which additionally contribute to unequal outcomes, but which can be\nmore precisely conceptualised as occurring at the micro meso and macro levels.\nIt can accommodate the idea of multiple racialisations, something which Critical\nRace Theory, used by Gillborn, has been critiqued for not doing sufficiently, as\nwell as incorporating intersectional explanations (Rizvi, 2009). The application\nof the multilevel framework is presented below as an attempt to make explicit\nthe cumulative layering of racialised disadvantage, whilst also avoiding the\nconflation of individual-level and institutionalised racialisation. In so doing,\nit specifies exactly how individual actions are framed by structural and material\nconditions, which are themselves built upon complex and shifting ideas about\nhuman groupings that are rooted in assumptions about racial hierarchies.\nApplying the multilevel framework: educational attainment\nAt the level of the individual teacher (micro), racialised interactions that rely\non essentialist notions of race, ethnicity and culture may taint the educational\nexperience of some pupils who are discriminated against. In this account,\nthe \u2018unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racial stereotyping\u2019\ndescribed in the Macpherson (1999: 6.34) element of institutional racism is\nredefined as micro-level racialisation, which can take account of multiple subject\npositions, including gender, class and religion.\nFavourable5 racialised stereotyping in the case of Chinese pupils and more\nnegative racialisation where black Caribbean, black African and certain South\nAsian origin pupils are concerned have been documented in research studies.\nSuch representations draw loosely on behavioural attributes, which appeared in\nEnlightenment classificatory systems that erroneously saw human phenotypical\ngroupings scientifically categorised in an hierarchical Great Chain of Being\nto God. De Gobineau\u2019s (1853) classification, to name one example, referred to\nthe Yellow race as tending towards apathy, lacking physical strength, having an\nobstinate will, but being theoretical and respecting the law. The black race, at\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\ninstitutional racism and ethnic inequalities 181\nthe lowest end of the hierarchy was marked by animalism, limited intellect, great\nenergy, wild desire and will, unable to distinguish between right and wrong. For de\nGobineau, the White race had energetic and superior intelligence, perseverance,\ngreat physical power and an instinct for order. These bear a striking resemblance\nto contemporary racialised stereotypes, although at times these have been\npositively recast, as in the case of popular and commodified street culture\nassociated with an essential blackness (Hill Collins, 2006).\nAccording to Archer and Francis (2005a), representations of Chinese\npupils\u2019 academic abilities derive from teachers\u2019 understandings of \u2018Chinese\nculture\u2019, which assumes high parental expectations, the valuing of education\nand stable family structures. These are seen as promoting obedience, respect and\ncompetition, as well as an appetite for educational success, which is supported\nthrough high teacher expectations, which have been linked to educational\nattainment (Mortimore et al., 1988; OFSTED, 1999). Stereotypes of Chinese\ngirls may include more negative elements, assuming passivity and patriarchal\ndominance.\nIn contrast, Youdell\u2019s (2003) work reveals an inversion of the \u2018coolness\u2019 of\nblack male identities within youth subcultures by some teachers who reproduce\nblack boys as challenges to authority (see also Frosh et al., 2002). Bodily and\nlinguistic practices are often negatively interpreted as culturally deficient and\nthen constituted by the school\u2019s organisational discourse as anti-school and\nincompatible with active learning, and this can extend to black girls too. Thus,\nmicro-level actions are constituted by, and reinscribe, meso-level racialisation\nrooted in political and popular discourses, which typify young black men as\nhyper-sexual, aggressive and criminally violent (Alexander, 1996; Murji, 1999). It\nis also perhaps in this context that black anti-school masculinities are manifested,\nas any resistance to these micro-racialising practices by black pupils further\nentrenches negative labelling in a teleological manner (see Sewell, 1997, 2000;\nHowarth, 2004).\nHowarth (2004) too describes micro-teaching practices and behaviour\nmanagement, which implicitly inscribe white British cultural dominance in\ndismissing the significance of Somali cultural practices, such as looking down\nwhen spoken to by adults as a sign of respect and deference \u2013 without meaningful\ncultural understanding, this is interpreted by British teachers as defiant and\ndisrespectful.\nFor South Asian Muslim boys, teacher perceptions appear to be overly\nconcerned with their presumed fundamentalist beliefs, patriarchal orientation,\nperceived self-segregation and violence (Archer, 2003; Crozier and Davies, 2008).\nConstructions of the identities of South Asian girls position them as passive\nand oppressed in their home lives, despite more agential understandings of the\nvarious coping strategies which may be employed to overcome experiences of\nschooling which are shaped by racism in school and wider society (Shain, 2000).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n182 coretta phillips\nAccording to Reay (2009), white working-class children have historically been\ndepicted as culturally inferior and requiring control and surveillance in the state\neducation system. Such ideas permeate educational practices in the contemporary\nperiod, contributing to a pathologisation of white and minority ethnic working-\nclass children as unmotivated, unambitious and educational \u2018losers\u2019 set against\nmiddle-class \u2018winners\u2019 (see also Lupton, 2003b).\nDecision-making by teachers \u2013 for example, choosing not to fully support\nand educationally challenge an individual pupil \u2013 may be influenced by these\ngeneralised and imprecise representations. This also undoubtedly contributes to\nthe disproportionately high exclusion rates among black pupils (DCSF, 2007),\nwhich has a deleterious effect on pupils\u2019 school careers and later employment\nopportunities, even though evidence suggests black excluded pupils are of above-\naverage academic ability (OFSTED, 1999). Further empirical work exploring the\nsubjective interpretations of teachers in these micro-interactions could valuably\nprovide an insight into intervention possibilities.\nAt the meso level, class and socio-economic disadvantage have also been at\nthe heart of sociological explanations of educational underachievement. Strand\u2019s\n(2008) analysis using the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England showed\nthat low socio-economic status contributed most to White British lower levels of\nattainment for boys and girls, but was also an issue for black boys. Additionally,\nblack pupils from middle and high socio-economic status homes underachieved\nin relation to White British pupils, despite high levels of commitment to\neducation.\nFor white pupils from lower socio-economic status families, Strand (2008)\nfound that low educational attainment was mediated through lower parental and\npupil aspirations for educational success and a low academic self-concept (see\nalso Lupton, 2003b). This is consistent with Reay\u2019s (2009) observation that many\nwhite working-class children have been made to feel educationally worthless.\nEvans\u2019 (2007) bio-ethnography on an inner London housing estate has also\nsuggested that white working-class educational underachievement can be partly\nattributed to formal learning rarely being practised in the home even though\neducation is highly valued. As Reay has noted, working-class children are less\nlikely to have access to private tuition and the culturally enriching activities\nthat can be provided by middle-class parents. Additionally, for boys, according\nto Evans, masculine identification was associated with fighting and toughness\nrather than educational success, while Frosh et al.\u2019s. (2002) earlier work indicates\na clear polarisation between popularity and schoolwork. For Reay (2009: 27),\nworking-class pupils, \u2018[f]acing an educational competition they cannot win [they]\nconstruct peer group macho and physically aggressive competitions where some\nof them can and do win\u2019. Theorised by Garner (2007) as contingent hierarchies,\nwhite working-class identities have been pathologised in specific historical\nand spatial contexts, with labels from academia (\u2018underclass\u2019) and popular\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\ninstitutional racism and ethnic inequalities 183\nconsciousness (\u2018chav\u2019) invested with the same lesser and blameworthy status\n(Haylett, 2001).\nRelatedly, parental disengagement with schools, also seen to influence\neducational outcomes, can be related to socio-economic and class disadvantage,\ngiven the middle-class milieu of the school and increased pressure to make parents\nresponsible for their children\u2019s learning (Ball, 2003). This falls within the category\nof political incorporation and empowerment, which is itself subject to stratifying\nprocesses. The demands of contemporary employment for men and women\nmay militate against active engagement by parents, which will impact most on\nminority ethnic and migrant groups because of their racialised disadvantage\nin the employment field (Heath and Cheung, 2006). Language and cultural\nbarriers, particularly in multi-ethnic and multi-faith urban schools, may also\ninhibit active parent\u2013school links (Lupton, 2003b). The latter two possibilities\nare structured by macro-level features of contemporary British society which\nlie beyond the institution. Finally, the legacy of more blatant forms of racism,\nexperienced by today\u2019s parents (as children), as well as fears about the effects of\nnegative stereotyping on their children may also be a contributory factor in poor\nhome\u2013school interactions involving black parents (Crozier, 2005).\nFor a whole variety of reasons \u2013 including economic constraints, access\nto housing, racist violence and racialised clustering choices \u2013 Britain\u2019s\nneighbourhoods have ethnically concentrated populations, particularly for South\nAsian communities (Lupton and Power, 2004). Johnston et al. (2004) have found\nthat pupils of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and to a lesser extent black origin\nattend more ethnically segregated schools than would be expected by their\nrepresentation in local neighbourhoods. Thus, concentrations of pupils whose\nattainment levels are average or below average are educated in schools where they\nform a significant proportion of pupils. Facilitated by school choice policies, this is\nindicative of ethnically informed choosing and class bias by parents (Tomlinson,\n1998). Such practices defy a dichotomous analysis of racism per se, but correspond\nwith a heavily racialised process that occurs at the interaction of class and state\neducational policies.\nSimilarly located at the meso level are the cultural practices of minority\nethnic groups, which may militate against educational success. Abbas\u2019 (2002)\nexamination of South Asian engagement with education suggested the greater\ntime commitment required for Muslim religious observance compared with\nHindu or Sikh religious observance might contribute to poorer educational\noutcomes (see also Lupton, 2003b, cf. Crozier and Davies, 2008).\nThe situational context of the school has also been shown to impact teaching\nquality, and such contextual effects are classed and racialised. Lupton\u2019s (2003b)\nexamination of four secondary schools in very deprived areas revealed numerous\nobstacles and disruptions to teachers\u2019 academic activities. Specialised teaching\nmaterials for lower ability children often had to be constructed, vulnerable\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n184 coretta phillips\nchildren required emotional support, and basic learning and extra-curricular\nactivities were constrained by the material poverty of parents.\nA more precise analysis of the role of institutional racialisation is proposed\nthat seeks to avoid the conflation of previous definitions, instead analysing\nthe routine bureaucratic processes and institutional practices that reinforce\ninequalities structured through ethnicity. It is here that Macpherson\u2019s (1999)\nnotion of the \u2018collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and\nprofessional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin\u2019\ncan be utilised.\nAn ethnocentric curriculum or extra-curricular activities which do not\ntake at face value the government\u2019s assertion that \u2018Britishness encompasses\nthe collective contribution diverse communities make to the country\u2019 (Home\nOffice, 2005) is an example of institutionalised discrimination (Searle, 2001).\nFailure to provide positive and meaningful representations of members of the\nwhite working-class in schooling (Reay, 2009) can be similarly defined. For\nWarren (2007), such practices rest on a culturalist logic which privileges certain\nkinds of white hegemonic knowledge based on racial, classed and gendered\ndifferentiation. School dress regulations, which prohibit certain kinds of cultural\nhairstyles or religious symbols favoured by particular ethnic groups, are another\nexample of institutional racialisation and discrimination (see Sewell, 1997).\nThe incompatibility of performance and attendance targets with an inclusive\ndelivery of the curriculum to nomadic Gypsy\/Traveller children is a further\nillustration (Cudworth, 2008; cf. Jordan, 2001). Denying the racist motivation\nor failing to respond to the racist victimisation of pupils or staff represent an\nadditional example of institutional racialisation (Crozier and Davies, 2008).\nAll such practices encapsulate the key elements of Carmichael and Hamilton\u2019s\n(1968) definition which sees racial inequalities being produced through routine\ninstitutional practices, regardless of intentionality, rooted in the historical process\nof racialised (and classed) exclusion.\nAt the macro level, the neo-liberal orientation towards promoting choice\nfor, and accountability towards, parents, established under the Conservative\nadministration, has been further enshrined in New Labour\u2019s education policy.\nThe language of marketisation, competition and choice is accompanied by the\nmanagerialist logic of testing and targets to raise educational standards. The\ncorrupting effects of these policies are numerous and they stand oxymoronically\nalongside government discourse promoting community cohesion and social\ninclusion. Combined, these strands have produced corrosive effects which have\nentrenched racialised and classed inequalities and maintained a hegemonic\nposition that favours the white middle class (Reay, 2008), which could\nbe seen largely as an unintended consequence or what Parsons (2009)\nterms \u2018passive racism\u2019. Deindustrialisation and the increased importance of\neducational credentials have made such processes crucial in determining\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\ninstitutional racism and ethnic inequalities 185\nlife chances and future opportunities in employment, housing, health and\nleisure.\nAcknowledging the interaction of micro-, meso- and macro-level\nracialisation enables a clearer picture of their compounding effects. Micro-level\nactions by teachers in the routine nature of their work are framed by state\npolicies in education, which have privileged a neo-liberalist standards agenda\nin which schools are pitted against each other to secure a dominant place in\nlocal education markets. Pressure from national government, local education\nauthorities and headteachers is likely to impel teachers to direct their efforts to\nthe goal of improving attainment overall. As funding is dependent on enrolments,\nwhich are dependent on parental popularity, there is mutual reinforcement of\na strategy in which selective targeting of some pupils over others is a \u2018rational\u2019\nresponse by teachers.\nImplicitly, this promotes a targeting of teacher resources at pupils not deemed\nundesirable or problematic learners. However, this category may not be solely\nobjectively determined, but instead be influenced by dominant discourses that\nattach inferior or superior behavioural attributes to certain ethnic and class\ngroups. A Pakistani pupil who is automatically stereotyped as an undesirable\nlearner and allocated by a teacher to a lower academic stream is disadvantaged\nby micro-level racialisation. When the pupil is not entered for a higher-tier\nGCSE examination or coached by their school to perform at the highest level,\nas Gillborn and Youdell\u2019s (2000) research on rationing has indicated, it is the\nmeso-level routine organisational practice of the school that further entrenches\nthe disadvantage of the pupil. Further compounded by institutional racialisation,\ncultural practices and structural constraints, which affect school composition and\nparental engagement, ethnic and class-based inequalities persist in educational\nattainment.\nStop and search\nThe multilevel model can also be applied to understand ethnic\ndisproportionality in the police use of stop-and-search powers in England and\nWales. Figures for 2007\/8 show that the rate of stop and search using powers under\nSection 1 Police and Criminal Evidence Act 19846 was 7.6 (black) and 2.3 (Asian)\ntimes higher than for white people (Riley et al., 2009). This long-observed ethnic\ndisproportionality can be partially attributed to micro-level racialisation and\ndiscrimination by individual police officers on the street. Stereotypes posit black\npeople as criminally disposed, drug-abusing and violent, which can be traced back\nto the classificatory systems of Enlightenment thinkers (de Gobineau, 1853). Asian\nmen have increasingly come to be perceived as disorderly, militant, culturally\nseparatist and inclined towards Islamic terrorism (Phillips and Bowling, 2007).\nEven the Macpherson Report (1999: para. 45.10) acknowledged that \u2018the majority\nof police officers who testified before us accepted that an element of the disparity\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n186 coretta phillips\nwas the result of discrimination\u2019. This is not, of course, to deny that black people\u2019s\nelevated rates of offending in relation to \u2018street crime\u2019 is a contributory factor\n(Phillips and Bowling, 2007).\nAt the meso level, racialisation structured through socio-economic\ndisadvantage and social class comes into play. Black people\u2019s greater \u2018availability\u2019\non the streets \u2013 because of higher levels of school exclusions and unemployment\ncombined with their residential concentration in higher crime areas \u2013 contributes\nto disproportionality in stop and search (Waddington et al., 2004). Political and\nmedia discourses on urban crime problems have cemented in the public mind a\nlink between violence, gangs and minority ethnic, particularly black, individuals\nand communities (Sveinsson, 2008).\nThe study of police organisational cultures has also consistently shown racial\nprejudice as a defining and taken-for-granted feature of \u2018cop culture\u2019 (Reiner,\n1992). Loftus\u2019 (2008) recent research indicates that the white, male, heterosexual\ninterior culture of the police is resisting the new diversity and equalities policing\nagenda post-Macpherson. Interacting at the micro-meso levels, translated\ninto operational practice, police officers may rely on unquestioned racialised\nstereotyping as they confront the \u2018mean streets\u2019 and battle crime, particularly\nwhere they perceive challenges to their authority and status (Foster, 2003; cf. Smith\nand Gray, 1983). For Jefferson (1993), age, sex, class, situation, demeanour and\nattitude determine who the police define as a trouble-making \u2018toe-rag\u2019, arguing\nthis is a generic rather than racialised category. Such a reductionist explanation\ndoes, however, negate the relative autonomy of racism from economic and\npolitical relations (CCCS, 1982).\nIn relation to institutional practices, there is some evidence that stop-\nand-search rates are higher in certain residential areas where there is not the\nconcomitant crime levels (MVA and Miller, 2000). Moreover, whilst \u2018racial\nprofiling\u2019 is not officially sanctioned, it appears to be unofficially practised as stop\nand search is a perceived indicator of performance by police officers. Minority\nethnic police officers have reported advisory comments by colleagues, such as\n\u2018if you see four black youths in a car, it\u2019s worth giving them a pull, as at least\none of them is going to be guilty of something or other\u2019 (Cashmore, 2001: 652).\nPolice legitimacy in minority ethnic communities is seemingly sacrificed even\nthough stop and search has an extremely limited impact on crime disruption and\ndetection (Miller et al., 2000), despite this being the official justification for its\ncontinuance.\nSuch practices coalesce with the dominant currents of macro-level\nracialisation in crime control which sees the increasing intolerance towards,\nothering and criminalisation of, socially, economically and politically\nmarginalised groups. In a climate of material and ontological insecurity, resulting\nfrom a pluralism of values and identities, where informal social control has\nfractured, and populist punitiveness is buoyed by an insatiable media and politic,\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\ninstitutional racism and ethnic inequalities 187\nresentment is rife and the deviance of the relatively deprived is harshly punished\nby the criminal justice system (Young, 2007). This can be seen in the massive over-\nrepresentation of minority ethnic people in prison. Periodic moral panics about\nblack street crime and violence echo the long-heard claims of an essentialist \u2018black\ncriminality\u2019 (Gilroy, 1982). Similarly constructed are the political concerns over\nthe criminality or extremism of immigrants. These features sustain institutional\npractices, propelled by a managerialist preoccupation with policing performance\nindicators and targets, framing micro-level racialisation by individual police\nofficers encountering minority ethnic citizens on the street.\nConcluding comments\nIn recognising the conceptual and practical limitations of institutional racism,\nthis paper has proposed an alternative multilevel framework to explain ethnic\ninequalities in welfare outcomes. Recognising intersecting cultural, material,\nideological, institutional and structural elements of racialisation can enhance\nour conceptual and theoretical understanding. It takes us beyond an approach\nwhich privileges institutional factors and instead recognises the significance of\nmicro-racialisation expressed at the individual level and the macro-racialising\ntendencies of late modernity. This framework can accommodate changes in\nfactors at each level, but it does implicitly assume multicausal explanations for\ninequalities in outcomes.\nAdditionally, this approach provides potential intervention points for policy\nmakers and service providers working towards eliminating inequality. Directly\ntackling everyday micro-level racialisation by service providers (teachers, police\nofficers, housing officers and so on) is a crucial first step, recognising conscious or\nunconscious processes of hierarchicalisation that individuals utilise. At the micro-\nmeso interaction, management oversight of allocation to tiers or streams, and the\nuse of stop-and-search powers by individual officers could reduce the cumulative\neffects of racialised stereotyping. At the meso level, critically scrutinising routine\npractices of institutional racialisation should form part of the \u2018racial-proofing\u2019 of\npolicies under the Race Relations Amendment Act 2000. In education, this could\nrelate to the curriculum, behaviour management, uniform, delivery of education,\nand so on, whilst in policing this could mean decoupling performance indicators\nfrom practices which have targeted racialised groups. At the meso-macro level,\nlimiting parental choice policies to produce a more even spread in pupil intakes\n(in terms of ability and advantage\/disadvantage) could counter some of the\nharmful effects of neo-liberalist education policies (Education Research Group,\n2009), which stand in contradistinction to the inclusion, equality and community\ncohesion agendas. Similarly, increasing police legitimacy in minority ethnic\ncommunities should be regarded as inextricably linked to controlling crime,\nthus requiring a less alienating and criminalising approach to policing Britain\u2019s\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n188 coretta phillips\nmulticultural society. Both necessitate a political discourse that does not sacrifice\nequality and social cohesion to the more dominant and punitive trends in both\neducation and criminal justice.\nAcknowledgements\nI am grateful to the Journal of Social Policy reviewers. Their comments on an earlier version of\nthis paper have improved it significantly.\nNotes\n1 For consistency purposes, \u2018ethnic\u2019 is used here because the main statistical sources of evidence\non unequal welfare outcomes draw on official categories that make reference to ethnic origins,\ngroups or appearance. That said, these categories do largely rely on phenotypical markers\nusually denoting biological racial origins. Elsewhere, the paper refers to \u2018racial\u2019 inequality\nbecause that has been the term typically used by proponents of the institutional racism thesis\n(e.g. Carmichael and Hamilton, 1968).\n2 This is different from Miles\u2019 (1989) Marxist conceptualisation (see also Cole, 2004).\n3 This approach is similar to Ginsburg\u2019s (1988) attempt to categorise racism at the\nsubjective, institutional, and structural levels in examining council housing, and Wight\u2019s\n(2003) conceptual agent-structure Bourdieuian analysis. It extends these by differentiating\ninstitutional racialisation from that occurring at the micro and macro levels, and goes on to\nconsider two social policy arenas, as well as providing a suggested path to rigorous empirical\nwork.\n4 Data on stop and search practices is for England and Wales.\n5 Even externally favourable stereotyping can negatively homogenise individuals and mask\ninternal variation and inequalities (see Archer and Francis\u2019 2005b).\n6 These are among the most frequently used stop and search powers. The power assists police\nofficers to allay or confirm suspicions about individuals without using their arrest powers.\nReferences\nAbbas, T.
