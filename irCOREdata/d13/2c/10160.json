The aim of this study was to delineate the characteristics of doctors utilising the service, to\ndescribe their psychological morbidity, and to determine if early intervention is achieved.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study including all consecutive self-referred doctors (n = 121, 50% male) presenting\nin 2002\u20132004 was conducted.

However, only 9% of the cohort were identified as severely distressed psychiatrically using\nthis measure. In approximately 50% of the sample, problems first presented in the preceding year.

As a professional\ngroup, doctors are highly stressed [3-5], which is a situa-\ntion that has been progressively increasing over time [6],\nand may be more susceptible to depression [7,8], burnout\nand anxiety; However, robust comparative research on\nthis topic is limited [9]. Women doctors have consistently\nbeen shown to have a higher risk of suicide than their\nmale counterparts, and their suicide rates may be higher\nthan for the general population [10]. However, rates of\nattempted suicide may be lower for doctors overall com-\npared to the general population [11,12]. Despite these fac-\ntors, doctors are notoriously reluctant to use health\nservices, often citing profound concerns about confidenti-\nality and stigma [13-15].\nIn the UK, treatment services specifically targeted for doc-\ntors are underdeveloped and little is know about the doc-\ntors that attend these services [16] or the consequences of\ntheir problems on either personal health or clinical prac-\ntice in the long-term. While doctors may access telephone\ncounselling or mentoring through their employer, mem-\nbership society and some of the Royal Colleges, these pro-\ngrammes do not offer face to face contact in a specialised\ndesignated clinic for doctors. This study, the first of its\ntype, has investigated by direct clinical evaluation a cohort\nof doctors attending a specialist psychotherapeutic service\nfor doctors in distress.\nThe aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive\ndescription of doctors seeking help at one service for psy-\nchological difficulties, based not only on standardised\nquestionnaires, but also on clinical interviews and clini-\ncian ratings.\nMethods\nThe service\nMedNet was established in 1997 by the London Deanery,\nwhich is now responsible for all postgraduate education\nin the London area. The MedNet service also covers an\narea of southern England (Kent, Surrey and Sussex Dean-\nery). It is a self-referral service available to all doctors, not\nonly those in training. The Tavistock Clinic hosts the Med-\nNet service in North London; in South London it is hosted\nat the Maudsley Hospital. The service is staffed by three\nConsultant Psychiatrists in Psychotherapy on a sessional\nbasis and a full-time secretary, and offers confidential\nbrief assessments and longer-term psychological support\nas required. The consultations take account of the practi-\ncal and cultural aspects of medical practice in the UK and\nexplore psychological health, work-life balance and career\nissues. The aim of the service is to provide a therapeutic\nopportunity for doctors to identify and clarify the nature\nof their problems and how they interact with their profes-\nsional and personal lives.\nThe sample\nAll doctors who contacted the service between February\n2002 and February 2004 were eligible for inclusion (n =\n123). Of these, 98.4% (n = 121) consented to take part.\nComplete data was obtained for 107 clients, and partial\ndata was collected for 14.\nMeasures\nData collection included standardised and bespoke ques-\ntionnaires, utilising both self-report (prior to index\nappointment) and clinician-completed assessments (dur-\ning index appointment). Bespoke questions included\ninformation on demographics, personal and family\nhealth history, education and professional training.\nInformation concerning levels of risk and the range, inten-\nsity and duration of problems was collected using the cli-\nnician-rated CORE Assessment (CORE-A) and the CORE\nWorkplace Therapy Assessment Form (CORE-Workplace)\n[17]. Both of these tools provide for a broad picture of\nmental state and are not time limited.\nDistress symptoms in the preceding week and standard-\nised assessment of severity of presentation were captured\nby the CORE Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) and the\nBrief Symptom Inventory (BSI). The CORE-OM [18],\nwhich contains 34-items using a 5-point Likert response\n('not at all' to 'most or all of the time'), provides scores for\nsubjective wellbeing, commonly experienced problems or\nsymptoms, life\/social functioning and risk to self and oth-\ners was also completed. Standardised scores were used to\ndetermine clinical cut points on this measure as provided\nby the distributor [18]. The Brief Symptom Inventory\n(BSI) [19], a 53-question, 5-point Likert scale (responses\nranging from 'not at all' to 'extremely') self-rated question-\nnaire that targets symptoms in nine areas, was used to\nquantify 'caseness'. Caseness implies the criterion for\nrequiring a formal mental health assessment and was\ncomputed using adult gender matched non-patient\nnorms. Adult psychiatric outpatient norms for the BSI and\nthe Global Severity Index (GSI) as a component of the BSI\nwere used to measure clients' degree of symptomatic dis-\ntress [19].\nWork-related distress was evaluated through the three\ndimensions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) [20]:\n'emotional exhaustion', 'depersonalisation' and 'personal\naccomplishment', each of which is scored independently.\nThe MBI is a 22-item questionnaire about job-related feel-\nings, which uses a 7-point Likert scale to capture how\noften the individual has ever felt a certain way (responses\n'never' to 'every day'). This questionnaire, like the COREPage 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2007, 5:26 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/5\/26Workplace and CORE-A, is not as limited to point in time\nassessment.\nData analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted in SPSS v. 15 and\nincluded descriptives, Chi-Squared tests for categorical\nmeasures, t-tests or Mann-Whitney U test for skewed data,\nas well as Pearson's correlation coefficient to identify rela-\ntionships between scale data.\nResults\nDemographics\nAn equal proportion of males (n = 61, 50%) and females\n(n = 60) presented to the service, with a mean age of 37 \u00b1\n8.6 years (range 24\u201364, Figure 1). The largest age group\nattending were 30\u201339 years (47%). There was no signifi-\ncant difference between the ages of male and female cli-\nents. The majority of clients were Caucasian (n = 79,\n65%), with the largest minority group Asian (n = 24,\n20%). Most were married (n = 68) and about 25% were\nsingle (n = 33). Approximately 33% had children.\nClients represented a variety of career grades (Figure 2),\nwith specialist registrars the largest group represented (n =\n31) followed closely by senior house officers (n = 28). A\ntotal of 23 consultants attended, of which nine were in\npost \u2264 5 years. There were no significant differences iden-\ntified by gender and career grade. A total of 75% (n = 89)\nstated that they had passed postgraduate exams, and 88\nhad completed a higher training. The specialties of psychi-\natry (n = 29) and medicine (n = 27) were the largest\ngroups represented (Figure 3), followed closely by those\nspecialising in general practice (n = 21).\nWhile all clients accessed the service via self-referral, 87\n(72%) indicated that they were encouraged to do so by at\nleast one individual. Nine were referred by multiple par-\nties. These included their GP (n = 3), occupational health\n(n = 22), senior colleague (education) (n = 11), senior col-\nleague (clinical) (n = 27) and\/or their postgraduate dean-\nery (n = 15), psychiatrist\/psychologist\/counsellor (n =\n11), and a colleague, friend or partner (n = 7). For 10 cli-\nents referral route was not recorded. A total of 76 (63%)\nrespondents indicated that they had seen their GP in the\npast 12 months. Approximately 50% (n = 58) had had a\nprevious consultation with a psychiatrist.\nPresenting problems\nData from clinician completed CORE-A (Table 1) indi-\ncated that the most prevalent presenting problems were\ndepression, anxiety\/stress, interpersonal problems, self-\nesteem problems, and work-related problems. These were\ncoded as moderate or severe in the majority of cases and\nfor a significant minority of doctors, these problems had\nappeared in the preceding year.\nAccording to therapist rating on the CORE-A, 42% were\nconsidered to be at some risk of suicide, with more than\n25% (n = 12) considered to have a moderate to severe risk.\nA larger number of males (n = 27) than females (n = 19)\nwere considered to be at risk, but this was not statistically\nsignificant. Eleven (9.1%, 3 male) clients had attempted\nsuicide in the past, six on more than one occasion. In eight\ncases, an attempt had taken place in the 12 months pre-\nceding their contacting the service. Six of those who had\nattempted suicide in the past were considered to be at\nmoderate to high suicidal risk at the time of presentation.\nNone of those who had attempted suicide in the past were\nconsidered a risk for harm to others or a forensic risk.\nMean scores on the CORE-OM subscales at intake are\ndetailed in Table 2. Clients scored worse than the general\npopulation but better than the clinical population (e.g.\nout-patients) on all sub-scales.

A similar proportion of males\n(61%) and females (64%) reached clinical cut-off as did a\nsimilar proportion of junior (66%) middle (54.5%) and\nsenior (68.3%) grades. The only significant difference\nidentified on the CORE-OM was that males had a lower\nscore on the Wellbeing subscale than females (  = 1.77\nvs  = 2.26 respectively, t = -2.8, p < 0.01).\nThe BSI (n = 114, Table 3) was used to assess clinical sever-\nity of presentation. Caseness was computed using two dif-\nferent methods. The first, by scoring over clinical cut-off\non two or more sub-scales (a t-score of \u2264 63) (n = 93) and\nthe second by scoring over clinical cut-off on the Global\nSeverity Index (n = 87). When t-score was based on gen-\neral population norms, 85.1% (n = 97) of clients could be\ndefined as potential psychiatric cases (i.e. individuals\nrequiring formal mental health assessment) by either of\nthese methods. However, when t-score was calculated\nbased on adult outpatient psychiatric norms, only 9% (n\n= 11 of 114) scored above cut-off, indicating that only a\nsmall proportion were severely psychiatrically distressed.\nOn the MBI (n = 114, Table 2), about 66%of clients pre-\nsented with high levels of emotional exhaustion (score \u2264\n27), 39% (score \u2264 10) with a high level of depersonalisa-\ntion, and 40% (score \u2265 33) were classified with a low level\nof personal accomplishment. Males had significantly\nhigher scores on the personal accomplishment construct\nthan females (  = 36 vs  = 32.7, t = 2.2, p < 0.05), how-\never there was no significant difference between genders\non reaching cut-off for burnout on this domain.

If one were to exclude the\npersonal achievement construct, as recent authors have\nperformed based on its' independence [8], the proportion\nof clients reaching classification of burnout increases to\napproximately 33% (n = 36).\nWork-related difficulties\nMore than 25% of clients (n = 31) had not taken any sick\nleave during the year prior accessing the service (11 did\nnot respond). Of the 79 clients who had been on sick\nleave (  = 46 \u00b1 74 days, median = 14), 31 (41%) had\nbeen on sick leave for a maximum of 7 days. In contrast,\n34 clients had been on sick leave between 21 days (more\nthan 1 working month) and 1 year (  = 98.32 \u00b1 88.7\ndays, median = 65). Where recorded, reasons for pro-\nlonged sick leave included psychological problems (n =\n19, primarily depression), both psychological and physi-\ncal problems (n = 6), and physical problems only (n = 9,\nincluding cold\/virus, asthma and surgery), four of whom\nrequired hospitalisation. There were no significant differ-\nences in number of sick days by gender or by career grade.\nMore than 75% of clients (n = 95) were dealing with\nwork-related difficulties at the time of presentation, how-\never only 36 clients were identified to have work issues as\none of their primary presenting problems. Work issues\nwere coded moderate or severe in 50 to 85% of cases, the\nmajority appearing in the 12 months prior to the assess-\nment (Table 4). Work functioning was considered by ther-\napists normal or satisfactory in 55% (n = 59) of clients,\nimpaired or severely impaired in 15% (n = 16). A total of\n27%(n = 29) were on sick leave at the time of assessment.\nFour of those whose work functioning was impaired (n =\n13) and all of those with severe impairment (n = 3) had\nbeen on sick leave in excess of 20 days in the preceding\nyear. There were no significant differences identified by\ngender and work-related difficulties. Many (54%, n = 65)\nhad work-related difficulties spanning multiple domains.\nEight had or were presently undergoing formal proceed-\nings at work (7 male), and two were suspended for clinical\nperformance issues.\nDays of sickness absence taken in the preceding year were\nsignificantly correlated with scores on each of the stand-\nardised psychological assessments used and the majority\nof their subscales, excluding anxiety and hostility on the\nBSI, problems and wellbeing on the CORE-OM and\ndepersonalisation on the MBI. In addition, a larger pro-\nportion of those who had taken \u2264 21 days sickness\nabsence in the preceding year (n = 34) met the classifica-\ntion for burnout on the MBI (\u03c72 = 5.1, p < 0.05), or scored\nhigher than normal population on the BSI (\u03c72 = 4.82, p <\n0.05) but there was no significant relationship between\nreaching clinical cut-off on the CORE-OM or the BSI for\nadult psychiatric outpatient norms and taking \u2264 21 days\nsick leave. Doctors who had taken extended leave were\nrated with consistently higher mean workplace problem\nseverity than those who had taken less or no time off,\nhowever this difference was only significant for the thera-\npist rating of workload problems (  = 3.6 vs  = 2.8, t =\nX\nX\nX X\nTable 2: Scores on CORE-OM (n = 115) and MBI (n = 114) at intake\nMeasure Sub-scale Score range Pre-\nintervention\nAbove clinical cut-off Published \nnorms*\nMean (SD) n (%) Mean (SD)\nCORE-OM Functioning 0\u20133.75 1.41 0.76 - - 0.85 0.65\nProblems 0\u20133.92 1.84 0.86 - - 0.90 0.72\nWellbeing 0\u20134.00 2.02 0.97 - - 0.91 0.83\nRisk 0\u20133.00 0.32 0.48 - - 0.20 0.45\nTotal score 0\u20133.68 1.44 0.69 72 62.6 0.76 0.59\nMBI Emotional \nexhaustion\nJan-54 31.05 12.5 73 64 22.19 9.53\nDepersonalisa\ntion\n0\u201330 8.8 6.95 44 38.6 7.12 5.22\nPersonal \naccomplishme\nnt\nFeb-46 34.32 8.09 45 39.5 36.53 7.34\nBurnout** - - - 21 18.4 - -\n*Normative data adapted from [17] (norms for non-clinical sample) and [20] (norms for sample in medicine); **high emotional exhaustion, \ndepersonalisation and low personal achievement.Page 5 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2007, 5:26 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/5\/26-3.4, p = 0.001).

This group had a higher number of\nsick days in the preceding year (  = 115 vs  = 55, z =\n3.27, p < 0.001) although three had taken less than 1\nmonth leave. Nine of this group had previously consulted\na psychiatrist. Similarly, of the 12 who were classed with\nmoderate or severe suicidal risk at the time of presenta-\ntion, two scored above outpatient psychiatric norms (one\nhad attempted suicide in the past), and three had taken\nnegligible time off sick.\nClients with any degree of risk for suicide, self-harm, harm\nto others and forensic\/legal harm by therapists on the\nCORE-A had significantly higher scores on the CORE-OM\nrisk subscale (  = 0.44 vs  = 0.2; t = -2.7, p < 0.01), but\nremained below the published clinical sample mean of\n0.63 [18]. This group also had a higher number of days off\nsick in the preceding year (  = 43 vs  = 58, z = 2.6, p =\n0.01).\nClients who were classified severely distressed on the BSI\nhad significantly higher scores on the CORE-OM total\nscore (  = 2.4 vs  = 1.4, t = -5.36, p < 0.001) and on all\nsubscales including depression, and on the MBI had a sig-\nnificantly higher score on the emotional exhaustion sub-\nscale (t = 2.07, p < 0.05) and a lower score on the personal\naccomplishment subscale (t = 4.04, p < 0.001).

Furthermore, a strict assessment protocol was\nadhered to, involving the use of reliable and valid psycho-\nmetric instruments. Nevertheless, the study presents a\nnumber of limitations in so far as it has no control group\nand clients referred themselves to the service (although\nthey were often strongly encouraged to do so).\nAn almost equal number of male and female doctors\nreferred themselves, and there was no difference in the\ndegree of morbidity. As accurate baseline numbers for\ndoctors and trainees within the regions covered by the\nMedNet service over the study period are not available, a\nmeasurement of the representativeness of our sample\nwith regard to gender can not be made. However, the\nabsence of differences in degree of morbidity by gender\ndoes not confirm previous work, which has found\nincreased morbidity in female doctors, most often meas-\nured by the GHQ [1,2].\nThe largest group of doctors to attend were aged 30\u201339\nyears, who were specialist registrars coming to the end of\ntheir training and thus looking for consultant posts, there\nwere also a significant number of newly-appointed con-\nsultants. This data lends support to the view that one of\nthe most stressful times for registered doctors is the tran-\nsition from trainee to full responsibility as either a con-\nsultant or principal general practitioner\nData from self-report measures show that 63% of the\nentire cohort of doctors seen had significant morbidity as\nmeasured by the CORE-OM and 85.1% reached caseness\non the BSI, however only 9% scored above adult outpa-\ntient psychiatric norms indicating that only a small\nnumber were severely psychiatrically distressed. In terms\nof suicidal risk, 42% were considered to be at risk by the\ntherapists. The BSI was able to reflect the level of general\nmorbidity in this population, but was limited in being\nable to identify the specific population of suicidal doctors\nas identified clinically by the CORE-A.\nA survey of newly qualified doctors in Norway found that\n14% of doctors had seriously thought about or planned\nsuicide in the preceding year [21]. In our sample, 11 had\nattempted suicide, eight in the preceding 12 months. This\nis well above the annual rate for attempted suicide in the\ngeneral population, which is 0.5% per annum [11], with\nthe doctors attending the service showing at least a 13-fold\ndifference compared to the general population. Closer\nscrutiny of the higher risk group showed that only two\nwere severely distressed according to the BSI. Three had\nnegligible time off sick. The lack of a clear pattern in this\nspecial group, some working whilst suicidal, illustrates the\ndifficulty in identifying such problems unless the individ-\nual is motivated to seek help.\nA total of 28% of the cohort had been on sick leave for\nmore than 4 working weeks (\u2264 21 days) in the preceding\nyear, the majority with depression. This adds further evi-\ndence to the finding that the doctors who attend are exten-\nsively distressed with a small sub-group who are at\nsignificant personal risk; clients with a history of\nattempted suicide having a significantly higher risk of sui-\nTable 4: CORE-WORKPLACE therapist assessment, n = 108\nDomain With problem Moderate\/severe Problem appeared in last 12 \nmonths,\nn (%) n (%) n (%)\nChange of job 29 26.9 21 72.4 23 79.3\nWorkload 48 44.4 37 77.1 19 39.6\nWork conditions 20 18.5 17 85 12 60\nWork \nrelationships\n32 29.6 22 68.8 12 37.5\nBullying 12 11.1 6 50 7 58.3\nTraumatic event 5 4.6 4 80 5 100\nViolence 1 0.9 1 100 1 100\nWork-related \nhealth\n10 9.3 7 70 6 60\nCareer issues 29 26.9 16 55.2 12 41.4\nOrganisational \nissues\n8 7.4 6 75 4 50\nFormal \nproceedings\n8 7.4 5 62.5 6 75\nOther 16 14.8 12 75 14 87.5Page 7 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2007, 5:26 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/5\/26cide [22]. The fact that 50% took little or no leave in the\npreceding 12 months suggests that MedNet clients repre-\nsent both ends of the spectrum of severity.\nThe fact that 72% were encouraged to attend by medical\ncolleagues indicates that their problems had become visi-\nble enough to engender concern. The vast majority had\ncompleted their postgraduate exams, indicating that aca-\ndemic performance was not compromised. Clinical per-\nformance in the study was judged by self-report and the\nclinical judgement derived from consultation with the\ndoctors. No direct objective evidence was available. The\nadverse effect of stress and poor health on performance is\nwell documented [23]. More than 75% of this cohort\nreported that they had work-related issues that had arisen\nwithin the preceding year; however the majority did not\nhave serious performance problems (there is no rating for\nimpairment for those off sick, which may skew the results\nto underreporting performance problems). Up to 33%\nreached the criteria for burnout and there were high levels\nof emotional exhaustion as measured by the MBI. This\ndata in conjunction with our clinical impression shows\nthat in general clinical performance is relatively preserved,\neven though the individual doctor is significantly dis-\ntressed and that despite serious distress, clients' jobs had\nnot yet been jeopardised. Many of them, despite high lev-\nels of emotional exhaustion, had maintained medium to\nhigh levels of personal accomplishment. This would sup-\nport the view that doctors with such difficulties put all\ntheir available energy into maintaining their professional\nidentity by working through their illness [24], with their\nexhaustion manifesting itself when off duty.\nApproximately 25% of the doctors were on sick leave\nmore than one working month; this represents a group\nthat merits further study. The main finding that emerged\nfrom this study about this group is that although there is\na trend to higher levels of morbidity, concerns about work\nand associated significant degrees of burnout were the\nmost important determinants of sick leave over 20 days\nduration.\nConclusion\nIn summary, this specialist service was successful in ena-\nbling doctors with considerable distress both personally\nand in the workplace, a small number being at significant\nrisk, to receive help. Although the majority of the doctors\nin the study had made occasional contact with their GP in\nthe preceding year, our clinical impression is that they had\nnot engaged in more intensive help before making contact\nwith our services. We suggest that many of these doctors\nwould not have done so if a confidential self-referral serv-\nice was not available and that the findings lend weight\nthat such services do achieve earlier engagement in a sig-\nnificant proportion of doctors attending, enhancing the\npossibility of 'nipping problems in the bud' both person-\nally and professionally.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nRH wrote the protocol and obtained funding for this audit\nsupporting IR as research fellow.
