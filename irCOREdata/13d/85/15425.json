Often, those available\ncommercially are expensive and have limited optical quality. The sealing process for commercial\nviewport often distorts the edges of the substrate and anti-reflection coatings do not reach the\nedges of the optic due to shadowing effects thus reducing the viewing area. Consequently there has\nbeen abundant interest in the development of alternatives with better optical quality and lower cost\n[1, 2, 3]. In previous work [4] we described a re-usable viewport design based upon a solder seal\nand bakeable to 240\u25e6C and highlighted the differences and advantages of this method over other\nschemes. Subsequently, this design was successfully used on cold atom experiments [5, 6]. However,\nthe motivation for further improvements arose after it was found the solder seal developed small\nleaks at the 10\u22129 atm cm3s\u22121 level after repeated removal and reattachment to the vacuum system.\nThis failure was attributed to deformation of the Conflat flange on which the solder and copper\ngasket seals are made due to the high stresses necessary to deform the copper gasket.\nThe first modified design presented here incorporates an additional flange to decouple the solder\nseal from the conflat flange which is bolted to the vacuum system. Figure 1 shows a plan view and\ntwo cross-sectional views of the modified viewport. The viewport is constructed by mounting an\noptical element on a double flange, in this case made from a \u201ccut down\u201d 70CF half\u2013nipple with\nan additional flange on which the optic is mounted manufactured in house and welded in place.\nThis additional flange has outer diameter (OD) of 76 mm and inner diameter (ID) of 38 mm to\nmatch the ID of the half-nipple tube. There are also 12 bolt holes; 6 \u001f11 mm clear holes are\nfor the M6 cap screws used to tighten the conflat seal which couples the viewport to the vacuum\nchamber, the 6 M6 tapped holes are for attaching the clamping flange. In principle this structure\ncould be machined from a single billet, thus avoiding the need for welding. The clamping flange is\nalso manufactured in house and has OD 76 mm. It has a recess in which the substrate can fit and\n12 bolt holes; 6 clear and 6 through as in figure 1. This design allows the copper gasket seal of the\nConflat flange to be made without applying stress to the solder seal surfaces. The materials and\nprocesses of the sealing procedure are the same as reported in earlier work. However, such is the\ncare required to successfully seal these viewports, a step by step procedure follows. Note that all\nequipment which comes into contact with surfaces to be placed under vacuum should be cleaned\nappropriately beforehand.\n2\nThe ends of the solder wire (\u001f0.7 mm Indalloy 165 [7]) were carefully joined to form a loop of\nappropriate diameter and then the solder ring was squashed to a thickness of approximately 0.3 mm\nbetween two flat polished surfaces. Excess material from the join area was removed with a scalpel\nto form a neat circle on the inside and outside edges of the ring and then the ring was squashed a\nsecond time to remove any roughness caused by the scalpel cut. At this point the join in the solder\nring should appear seamless. A solder ring was then placed carefully onto the flat surface on which\nthe vacuum seal is to be made and then the viewport substrate placed on top. A second solder ring\nwas then placed on top of the substrate to cushion the clamping flange, which is placed on top.\nTwo conical disc springs [8] were placed base-to-base onto each M6 (1 mm pitch) securing bolt and\nthe bolts were tightened to a torque of 3 Nm. The purpose of the disc springs is to maintain the\nforce on the clamping flange when the solder softens during baking. After cooling the bolts were\nre-tightened to a torque of 3 Nm after which no further tightening was required, even after further\nbaking cycles.\nDuring previous attempts at viewport manufacture we found that the solder seal was less depend-\nable when using anti-reflection (AR) coating on substrates because the rough edge of the coating\ncould prevent the vacuum seal being successfully made. For this reason, we used some substrates\nwith a coating free edge, on which to make the vacuum seal. A further refinement is the use of\ndifferent bolt heads for the viewport and knife-edge seals to eliminate accidental over-tightening of\nthe solder seals when the conflat seal is made. The viewports were leak tested using a Stanford\nInstruments RGA100 residual gas analyzer with an electron multiplier. No leaks were detected\nabove the noise floor of the detector, < 10\u221210 atm cm3\/s. This viewport design has been repeatedly\ntested using BK7 and ZnSe optical elements. The viewports have been re-attached and baked six\ntimes up to 250\u25e6C without adversely affecting the UHV viewport seal.\nThe design outlined above was implemented on viewports attached to a vacuum chamber for use\nin a recent cold atom experiments [9] and in addition used for an optical dipole trap experiment.\nFigure 2 shows the number of Rb atoms trapped in a CO2 laser optical trap loaded directly from a\nvapor cell MOT within the chamber as a function of time. Such a far-detuned optical dipole trap\nis conservative [10] and the measured 1\/e lifetime of 9.5 s is limited by the background pressure in\nthe UHV chamber. The lifetime suggests a pressure of around 10\u221210 Torr and is limited by the gas\n3\n11\n1\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\n4\n5\n4\n4\n8\n8\n6\n7\n6\n7\na)\nb)\na)\nb)\nFIG. 1: (Top) The viewport in plan view. (Middle and lower parts) Different cross-sectional views through\nthe viewport, indicated by (a) and (b). The viewport consists of: (1) clamping flange, (2) double flange,\n(3) optical element, (4) preflattened Indalloy 165 solder seal, (5) hexagonal head securing bolt, (6) OFHC\ncopper gasket, (7) socket-head bolt and (8) conical disk springs.\nload from the Rb dispensers and pumping speed from the 40 l\/s Varian diode ion pump, not the\nleak rate of the viewports.\nThe specialized requirement in the design presented here is in the manufacturing process. Non-\nstandard vacuum components are used including, in the present design, the mounting flange welded\nonto a standard, albeit shortened, conflat half nipple. The design is also bulkier than many viewports\nwhich presents a disadvantage for optical experiments requiring high numerical aperture (NA). To\naddress these issues we have also investigated two simplified designs. First of all we note that the\nkey to the robustness of the design presented so far in comparison with our previous design [4] is the\n4\n0 10 20 300\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nTrap Time (s)\nAt\nom\n N\num\nbe\nr N\n\/N\n0\nFIG. 2: Measurement of the number of Rb atoms in a CO2 laser optical dipole trap for increasing hold\ntime. A 1\/e lifetime of 9.5 \u00b1 0.5 s is deduced from an exponential fit to the data.\nuse of a length of tube between the conflat flange, that attaches to the rest of the vacuum system,\nand the optic to metal seal. As this seal is typically only about 2 mm wide we implemented the\ndesign shown in Figure 3, where we have discarded the mounting flange and sealed directly on the\nend of the tube. For a standard 70CF half nipple the tube has a wall thickness of 1.5 mm. Prior to\nsealing, the end of the pipe was lapped to ensure it was completely flat. The sealing process follows\nthe same principles as outlined above. In this case the clamping flange was tightened onto the\nconflat flange with 12 M4 (0.7 mm pitch) bolts with spring washers. A torque of about 1.2 Nm was\nsufficient to ensure a good seal. Figure 3 shows the design of this window including the specially\ndesigned clamping flange. This viewport design has been leak tested to < 10\u221210 atm cm3\/s and we\nhave successfully operated a vacuum system with eight windows of this design at a pressure below\n10\u22128 Torr for an extended period of time.\nIn order to increase the robustness of this design we have investigated the use of an ultra-high\nvacuum compatible epoxy to improve the glass-to-metal seal. The shaped solder ring between\nthe steel tube and the window is maintained in order to allow for the differential expansion of\nthe stainless steel tube and the window material. However, a thin layer of epoxy is applied on\neither side of the ring to ensure a strong bonding of the solder ring to both the steel tube and the\nwindow. To further increase the adhesion between the solder ring and the steel, the tube end was\nnot lapped flat but left with a spiral shaped machine mark on the end face. The epoxy used is\n5\nEpotek 353ND, which has an exceptionally low outgassing rate [11] and an operating temperature\nof up to 250\u25e6C. For a bake to 200\u25e6C the differential expansion between a 40 mm diameter steel tube\nand a quartz window is 120 \u00b5m. Using the shear modulus for lead (97.5% of Indalloy 165 is lead)\nthe corresponding shear force is found to be approximately an order of magnitude less than the\nshear strength of the epoxy. Thus, we are confident that the solder ring deforms to account for the\nthermal expansion while maintaining the integrity of the actual vacuum seals between the solder\nring and the steel tube and window respectively. This technique provides an extremely reliable\nseal because as the viewport is baked, the epoxy becomes supple and fills any imperfections in the\nsealing surfaces or AR coating.\na), c)\na)\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n5\n6\n6\n7\n7\n8\n8\nb)\nb)\nFIG. 3: (Top) The viewport in plan view. Below are shown different cross-sectional views through the\nviewport indicated by a), b) and c). The viewport consists of: (1) brass clamping flange, (2) standard but\nshortened stainless steel conflat half nipple, (3) optical element, (4) pre-flattened Indalloy 165 solder seal,\n(5) M4 socket-head bolt, (6) OFHC copper gasket, (7) M6 socket-head bolt, (8) conical spring washer.\nFinally we note that this method has also been successfully used to seal an 70 mm diameter AR\u2013\n6\ncoated BK7 optic onto a 70 mm OD pipe on a vacuum chamber for a new cold atom experiment.\nThis seal has been leak tested to less than 10\u221210 atm cm3\/s. This highlights the versatility of the\ndesign which could in principle be scaled up or down to arbitrary sizes for experiments where the\nuse of standard commercial flange sizes is not feasible.\nIn summary, we have developed a reliably re-useable solder seal viewport mounted on a modi-\nfied Conflat half nipple. Problems associated with the repeated re-use of the viewport have been\ncircumvented with the use of a decoupled double flange structure. The viewport design has been\nincorporated into a UHV chamber used for several cold atom experiments. Furthermore, we have\nshown that UHV viewports can by created by sealing directly to a vacuum pipe and the use of\nepoxy on the solder seals gives added protection against small surface imperfections.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of E.C.
