For vitaminD alone in daily doses of 10 \u03bcg\nor 20 \u03bcg, no significant effects were found. No interaction\nwas found between fracture history and treatment\nresponse, nor any interaction with age, sex, or hormone\nreplacement therapy.\nConclusion This individual patient data analysis indicates\nthat vitamin D given alone in doses of 10-20 \u03bcg is not\neffective in preventing fractures. By contrast, calcium and\nvitamin D given together reduce hip fractures and total\nfractures, and probably vertebral fractures, irrespective of\nage, sex, or previous fractures.\nINTRODUCTION\nFragility fractures cause excess mortality, substantial\nmorbidity, and related health and social service expen-\nditures in older people.1 2 Risk of fracture is higher in\ninstitutionalised older people than in community\ndwelling older people of the same age, reflecting a\ngreater risk of falls and lower bone mineral density.3 4\nVitamin D insufficiency is common in older people,\nparticularly in residential and care homes. This may\ncontribute to secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone\nloss, impaired neuromuscular function, and an\nincreased risk of falls and fractures.5-8 This provides\nthe rationale for using vitamin D to prevent fractures\nin older people.\nA large randomised controlled trial in women in\nFrench nursing homes or apartments for older people\nshowed that calcium and vitamin D supplementation\nincreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, decreased\nparathyroid hormone, improved bone density, and\ndecreased hip fractures and other non-vertebral\nfractures.9 Subsequent randomised trials examining\nthe effect of vitaminD supplementation\u2014with or with-\nout calcium\u2014on the incidence of fractures have pro-\nduced conflicting results.10 A meta-analysis in 2005\nsuggested that 17.5-20 \u03bcg of vitamin D daily decreased\nthe risk of hip and non-vertebral fractures, whereas\nlower doses (10 \u03bcg\/day) were ineffective.11 However,\nrecent meta-analyses indicate that a combination of\ncalcium and vitamin D reduces hip and non-vertebral\nfractures but that vitamin D alone does not.12 13\nStudy level meta-analyses may be adequate when\nestimating a singled pooled treatment effect or investi-\ngating study level characteristics, but they can lead to\nbiased assessments and have limitations in explaining\nheterogeneity.14 Analyses of individual patients\u2019 data\noffer improved statistical power to investigate whether\ntreatment effects are related to the patient. We used\nindividual patient data methods to do a meta-analysis\nof randomised controlled trials of vitamin D\u2014with or\nwithout calcium\u2014in preventing fractures and investi-\ngated if treatment effects are influenced by patients\u2019\ncharacteristics.\nMETHODS\nSearching and selection criteria\nWe searched, with no language restrictions, for publi-\ncations between January 1966 and July 2008 in Med-\nline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of\nControlled Trials by using MeSH terms: [Fractures,\nbone] combined with [Vitamin D], [Ergocalciferol] or\n[Cholecalciferol]. We also searched for text words in\ntitle and abstract: \u201cFractu*\u201d or \u201cBone fractu*\u201d, in com-\nbination with \u201cVitamin D\u201d, \u201dCholecalciferol\u201d, or\n\u201cColecalciferol\u201d.

The decision\nto include only studies above this size was driven by\nconcerns that each study,while contributing additional\ncases, would also further reduce the mass of shared\nstudy variables for aggregated analysis. We identified\n248 abstracts (fig 1); 47 covered clinical trials of vita-\nmin D with a fracture outcome\u201436 with n<1000 and\n11 with n\u22651000. We contacted the corresponding\nauthors of these 11 trials. Four groups were unwilling\nor unable to provide patient level data. 9 15-17 Seven\ngroups agreed to participate.\nIncluded studies\nSix studies were individually randomised.18-23 One\nstudy was cluster randomised at the level of home care\ndistrict.24 Of the individually randomised controlled\ntrials, one was quasi-randomised by birth date.19 Two\nstudies used a factorial design.22 24 Table 1 gives the\ndetails of the studies. Information on fracture history\nwas not available in one study.18 All studies reported\nincident hip fractures and other non-vertebral frac-\ntures. All but one reported on clinical vertebral\nfractures.19\nData extraction and validation\nWe defined a standardised data format and retrieved\ndatasets electronically in anonymised form from the\ncorresponding authors. We issued queries to the parti-\ncipating centres for discordant data.\nQuantitative data synthesis and statistical analysis\nWeanalysed data at the level of the patient and accord-\ning to the intention to treat principle. The timescale\nused was number of days between date of randomisa-\ntion and date of fracture. When the fracture date was\nunknown, we used the date of the reporting visit. The\nprimary end point was any fracture, with hip fracture\nand clinical vertebral fracture as secondary end points.\nWe defined base models by using conditional logistic\nregression incorporating known predictors of fracture\nrisk, which would be expected a priori to contribute to\nvariation in fracture rates: age, sex, hormone replace-\nment therapy, bisphosphonates, previous hip fracture,\nprevious vertebral fracture, and \u201cother previous frac-\nture\u201d in adulthood.We added treatment allocation and\ninteraction terms to this model to identify factors that\nsignificantly modified the response to vitamin D. We\npre-specified the following study level variables for\nentry into this interaction analysis: vitamin D daily\ndose equivalent, route (oral or intramuscular), and\nco-administration of calcium. We then used variables\nthat interacted significantly to stratify the subsequent\nfixed effects Cox fracture-free survival analysis,\nwhich contained a series of dummy variables to\ncapture residual differences in risk of fracture between\ntrials. A subgroup analysis by dose (10 \u03bcg\/day\nv 20 \u03bcg\/day) was pre-specified. We thus classified the\nMeyer, Larsen, andWomen\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI)\nstudies as 10 \u03bcg studies and classified the Smith study\n(equivalent to 20.5 \u03bcg\/day), the Lyons study, the\nRECORD study, and the Porthouse study (all equiva-\nlent to 20 \u03bcg\/day) as 20 \u03bcg studies. Observations were\ntruncated after 36 months; only the WHI study pro-\nvided sufficient patients to populate the analysis\nbeyond this.\nSensitivity\nWe did an influence analysis to assess to what extent\nconclusions would have been modified by failure to\ninclude one or more individual studies in the analysis.\nRecent work suggests that ergocalciferol has half the\ncalciotrophic effect of cholecalciferol,25 so we\nregrouped 20 \u03bcg ergocalciferol studies with 10 \u03bcg\ncholecalciferol studies.\nRESULTS\nBase model including previous fractures (six studies,\nn=65073)\nIncreasing age (hazard ratio per decade 1.34, 95% con-\nfidence interval 1.29 to 1.39), male sex (0.52, 0.47 to\n0.58), previous hip fracture (1.86, 1.62 to 2.14), pre-\nvious vertebral fracture (1.71, 1.31 to 2.22), other frac-\nture (1.45, 1.35 to1.57), baseline bisphosphonate use\n(1.54, 1.22 to 1.92), andbaselinehormone replacement\ntherapy (0.69, 0.63 to 0.76) contributed significantly to\nthe risk of any fracture. Strongly statistically significant\ninteraction terms were route of vitamin D administra-\ntion (P=0.02), dosing interval (P=0.02), and co-admin-\nistration of calcium (P=0.006), indicating significant\nmodification of response to treatment (fig 2). Bisphos-\nphonate use was of borderline significance (P=0.07).\nPrevious fractures did not significantly interact with\ntreatment response (P=0.64 to 0.79 depending on\nsite), nor did we find an interaction with age, sex, or\nhormone replacement therapy. As previous fractures\ndid not modify the response, we included the Lyons\nstudy,which had no information onprevious fractures,\nin the analysis.\nAbstracts screened for retrieval (n=248)\nPotentially relevant RCTs identified\nand screened for retrieval (n=47)\nPotentially appropriate RCTs to be\nincluded in meta-analysis (n=11)\nRCTs with raw data (n=7)\nBy study outcome:\n  Hip fracture (n=7; 68 517 patients)\n  Any fracture (n=7; 68 517 patients)\n  Spine fracture (n=6; 67 373 patients)\nNot an RCT or no fracture outcome (n=201)\nRCTs excluded: Less than 1000 participants (n=36)\nRCTs excluded: Unable or unwilling\nto provide raw data (n=4)\nFig 1 | Flow chart of analysis.

Significant interaction terms were route (P=0.03)\nand calcium (P=0.04), and borderline significant inter-\naction terms were bisphosphonate use (P=0.06) and\ninterval (daily v non-daily, P=0.12).\nEffect of vitamin D treatment (with or without calcium)\nAny fracture\nThe analysis covered 7202 fractures over 177 203 per-\nson years. Placebo fracture rates were higher in the vita-\nminD trials than in the trials combining vitaminDwith\ncalcium, as these studies recruited older participants\n(table 1). We found no significant effect of vitamin D\nwithout calcium (hazard ratio 1.01, 0.92 to 1.12, P=0.80)\n(fig 3). Studies in which vitamin D was combined with\ncalciumshowed reduced fracture risk (hazard ratio0.92,\n0.86 to 0.99, P=0.025). We adjusted the analysis for\nstudy, age, and sex, as well as for baseline hormone\nreplacement and bisphosphonate use. Stratification by\nroute of administration showed a significant effect of\noral vitamin D (hazard ratio 0.93, 0.87 to 0.99, P=0.02)\nbut not injected vitamin D (1.11, 0.95 to 1.31, P=0.20).\nResults were unaffected by exclusion of users of hor-\nmone replacement therapy and bisphosphonates. We\nfound no significant treatment by study interaction in\neither group of studies (calcium and vitamin D studies\nP=0.67 to 0.78, vitamin D studies P=0.14 to 0.44).\nHip fracture\nIn total, 978 hip fractures were recorded. The risk of\nhip fracture was borderline decreased by vitamin D\nwith calcium (hazard ratio 0.84, 0.70 to 1.01, P=0.07)\n(fig 4). Vitamin D studies showed no reduction in risk\nof hip fracture (1.09, 0.92 to 1.29, P=0.34). Rates of hip\nfracture in the placebo groupwere lower in the calcium\nand vitaminD trials than in the vitaminD studies. Stra-\ntification by route showed treatment effects short of\nstatistical significance (oral studies 0.93, 0.81 to 1.06,\nP=0.26; intramuscular studies 1.46, 1.00 to 2.13,\nP=0.05). We found borderline significant treatment\nby study interaction terms for the RECORD study\n(P=0.06) and theLyons study (P=0.09). Thiswas driven\nby a hazard ratio for hip fracturewith vitaminDof 0.98\n(0.76 to 1.27) in the Lyons study (pooled hazard ratio\n1.18 (0.94 to 1.48) in the other vitaminD studies) and a\nhazard ratio of 1.31 in the RECORD study (pooled\nhazard ratio 0.76 (0.62 to 0.94) for the remaining cal-\ncium and vitamin D studies).\nClinical vertebral fracture\nOnly 542 incident clinical vertebral fractures were\nreported. We found no significant treatment effect in\ncalcium and vitamin D studies (hazard ratio 0.85, 0.66\nto 1.11, P=0.25) or vitaminD studies (1.12, 0.70 to1.79,\nP=0.63) or when stratified by route of administration\n(P=0.27 to 0.29).\nVitamin D dose\nIrrespective of site of fracture or dose of vitamin D, we\nfound no significant effect of vitamin D given without\nTable 1 | Characteristics of seven included clinical trials\nTrial Patient category\nRandomisation*\nand duration Study arms No Mean (range) age Men (%)\nPrevious fracture\n(%)\nHormone therapy and\nbisphosphonates\nallowed\nLyons18 Residential home or\nsheltered housing\nresidents (UK)\nI; 36 months Oral D2 100 000 IU\/4 months\nv placebo\n3440 83.8 (62-107) 23.7 ND Yes\nMeyer19 Nursing home\nresidents (Norway)\nQ; 24 months Oral D3 10 \u00b5g\/day v placebo 1144 84.7 (47.6-101) 24.1 Hip 26.2; vertebral\nND; other ND\nYes\nPorthouse21 General practice\npatients with risk\nfactors (UK)\nI: 18-42 months\n(median 22.5)\nOral D3 20 \u00b5g\/day + 1000 mg\ncalcium v leaflet\n3314 76.8 (70.2-102.7) 0 Hip 0.5; vertebral\n0.8; other 56.5\nYes\nLarsen24 Community dwelling\nage \u226566 (Denmark)\nC; 42 months Oral D3 10 \u00b5g\/day + calcium\n1000 mg + environmental\nintervention v oral D3 10 \u00b5g\/day +\ncalcium 1000mg v environmental\nintervention v none\n9605 75 (66-103) 39.9 Hip 3.3; vertebral\n0.7; other 7.4\nYes\nRECORD22 Previous\nosteoporotic fracture\n(UK)\nI; 24-62 months\n(median 30.4)\nOral D3 20 \u00b5g\/day + calcium\n1000 mg v oral D3 20 \u00b5g\/day v\ncalcium 1000 mg v double\nplacebo\n5292 77.5 (70-100) 15.3 Hip 17.1; vertebral\n0.2; other 82.8\nNo\nSmith20 General practice\npatients presenting\nfor influenza\nvaccination (UK)\nI: up to 36 months\n(median 36.0)\nIntramuscular D2 300 000 IU\/\n12 months v placebo\n9440 80.2 (70.3-100.1) 46.1 Hip 2.8; vertebral\n0.6; other 34.8\nNo\nWHI23 Community based,\npostmenopausal\nwomenaged\u226550(US)\nI: median 85.\n4 months\nOral D3 10 \u00b5g\/day + calcium\n1000 mg v placebo\n36 282 62.4 (51-81) None Hip 0.6; vertebral\n1.5; other 9.8\nYes\nND=not determined.\n*I=individually randomised; Q=quasi-randomised by birth date; C=cluster randomised.\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 3 of 8\ncalcium. Vitamin D given as 10 \u03bcg with calcium signif-\nicantly reduced the risk of any fracture (P<0.05) and\nhip fracture (P<0.01). However, the 20 \u03bcg dose with\ncalcium was not associated with a reduced risk of frac-\nture (P=0.58) (table 2).\nAbsolute risk reduction and numbers needed to treat\nWe did this analysis only for vitamin D given with cal-\ncium, as vitamin D given alone could not be shown to\nreduce fracture risk significantly. For any fracture, cal-\ncium with vitamin D was associated with an absolute\nrisk reduction of 0.5% over three years (untreated\nevent rate 21.0 per 1000 person years, hazard ratio\n0.92), corresponding to a number needed to treat of\n213 people treated for three years to prevent a fracture.\nFor people over the ageof 70, the absolute risk reduction\nwas 0.9% (untreated event rate 29.0 per 1000 person\nyears, hazard ratio 0.89) and the number needed to\ntreat was 111. The corresponding numbers for people\nwith previous fracture (untreated event rate 33.5 per\n1000 person years, hazard ratio 0.87), irrespective of\nage, were 1.2% and 82. For hip fractures specifically,\nthe absolute risk reduction was 0.4% for participants\nagedover 70 and0.2% inparticipantswith previous frac-\ntures, giving numbers needed to treat of 255 and 548.\nSensitivity analysis\nIn the influence analysis for vitaminD trials, the hazard\nratio remained close to 1.0 irrespective of exclusion of\nany one study in both the any fracture scenario and the\nhip fracture scenario (fig 5). For calcium and vitaminD\ntrials, the hip fracture analysis was sensitive to exclu-\nsion of contributing studies, leading to a mean effect\nclose to 1.0 if the Larsen study was excluded.

The Larsen trial was unique in\nusing a cluster randomised factorial design, in which\nenvironmental modification and drug review were\nadded in two study arms.We repeated the hip fracture\nanalysis across the calcium and vitamin D studies\nexcluding the two arms of the Larsen study that\nincluded environmental intervention. In this post hoc\nanalysis, the effect of calcium and vitamin D on hip\nfractures had a hazard ratio of 0.82 (0.67 to 0.99,\nP=0.045). For vitamin D studies, mean effects were\nbetween 1.00 (exclusion of Smith study) and 1.18\n(exclusion of Lyons study). Considering 20 \u03bcg of ergo-\ncalciferol to be equivalent to 10 \u03bcg rather than 20 \u03bcg of\ncholecalciferol affected only the vitamin D studies.\nThis did not alter the findings (any fracture: hazard\nratio 1.01, 0.90 to 1.14, P=0.83 for lower dose and\n1.01, 0.82 to 1.24, P=0.95 for higher dose).\nTrials byChapuy, Lips, Trivedi, andLawand collea-\ngues did not contribute data to our analysis but\nreported similar effects.9 15-17 Inclusion of summary\ndata from these studies led to a combined hazard\nratio for hip fracture of 1.11 (0.96 to 1.29) for vitamin\nD studies and 0.82 (0.72 to 0.95) for calcium and vita-\nmin D studies.\nDISCUSSION\nThis analysis of individual patients\u2019 data from seven\nlarge fracture trials indicates that vitamin D with cal-\ncium reduces the overall risk of fracture, and probably\nhip and clinical vertebral fractures, irrespective of sex\nand fracture history. For hip fractures, we were able to\nshowa significant risk reductionwith the lower vitamin\nD dose of 10 \u03bcg daily given with calcium. Because the\nreduction in risk was small (16% or less) and rates of\nfracture were low in most studies, the number needed\nto treat ranged from more than 200 people (no pre-\nvious fracture) to 82 people (with a previous fracture)\ntreated for three years to prevent any fracture and from\n548 (no previous fracture) to 255 people (with a\nprevious fracture) treated for three years to prevent a\nhip fracture. Vitamin D given alone in daily doses of\n10-20 \u03bcg (400-800 IU) was not shown to be effective.\nComparisons with other studies\nOur results agree with three recent meta-analyses that\nexamined study level data from trials of supplementation\nwith vitaminD, calcium, or the two combined.121326 The\ntrials included in these systematic reviews differed\nslightly. Two reviews focused on vitamin D and also\nfound that vitamin D alone was ineffective in preventing\nany fracture or hip fractures and that the combination of\ncalcium and vitamin D showed benefit.1213 Boonen et al\ndid not examine \u201cany fractures\u201d12; in the Cochrane\nreview, calcium and vitamin D prevented any fractures\nonly in people living in institutions.13 By contrast, the\nfindings of our individual patient data review strongly\nfavoured calcium and vitamin D for prevention of any\nfractures in all populations examined. The Cochrane\nreview did not find that clinical vertebral fracture was\nprevented by vitamin D with or without calcium\nsupplementation,13 as foundhere, although few trials pro-\nvided these data. These two previous systematic reviews\ndid not assess the influence of dose of vitaminD or com-\npare ergocalciferol with cholecalciferol in detail.\nTang et al systematically reviewed fracture preven-\ntion in trials of calcium, with and without vitamin D.26\nThe overall risk reduction reportedwas 0.90 (95% con-\nfidence interval 0.80 to 1.00) for calcium trials and 0.97\n(0.92 to 1.03) for calciumandvitaminD trials, although\nno significant difference was found between these two\ngroups. The group of calcium and vitamin D trials in\nTang et al differed from those in the Cochrane review\nand the review by Boonen et al and included Larsen,24\nwithout taking account of the cluster design.\nRecently, Bischoff-Ferrari and colleagues did a new\nstudy levelmeta-analysis covering 12 randomised con-\ntrolled trials and concluded that received vitamin D\ndoses in excess of 400 IU\/day prevented non-vertebral\nfractures.27 Differences between their conclusions and\nours, although pronounced, are explained by the clas-\nsification of the WHI study (400 IU\/10 \u03bcg vitamin D\nplus calcium) as a high dose (765 IU\/19 \u03bcg) study by\nincluding other vitaminD sources in the treatment arm\n(intervention 400 IU plus base 365 IU) and disregard-\ning them in the control arm (intervention 0 IU plus\nbase 368 IU).\nTable 2 | Subanalysis* of anti-fracture efficacy, stratified by vitamin D dose and calcium co-administration\nFracture 10 \u03bcg dose 20 \u03bcg dose\nWith calcium: (WHI, Larsen studies) (Porthouse, RECORD-2 studies)\nAny Treated 18.7\/1000 PY; untreated 20.2\/1000 PY; HR=0.91 (95% CI 0.85 to\n0.99), P=0.02\nTreated 43.2\/1000 PY; untreated 51.1\/1000 PY; HR 0.95 (0.80 to 1.14), P=0.58\nHip Treated 2.4\/1000 PY; untreated 3.0\/1000 PY; HR=0.74 (0.60 to 0.91),\nP=0.005\nTreated 10.3\/1000 PY; untreated 9.2\/1000 PY; HR 1.30 (0.88 to 1.92), P=0.19\nVertebral Treated 1.4\/1000 PY; untreated 1.6\/1000 PY; HR=0.86 (0.65 to 1.14), P=0.31 Treated 2.7\/1000 PY; untreated 3.1\/1000 PY; HR 0.97 (0.48 to 1.98), P=0.93\nWithout calcium: (Meyer study) (Lyons, Smith, RECORD-1 studies)\nAny Treated 85.9\/1000 PY; untreated 94.1\/1000 PY; HR=0.93 (0.67 to 1.28),\nP=0.64\nTreated 45.9\/1000 PY; untreated 44.4\/1000 PY; HR 1.02 (0.92 to 1.14), P=0.69\nHip Treated 61.3\/1000 PY; untreated 56.2\/1000 PY; HR=1.10 (0.74 to 1.64),\nP=0.64\nTreated 14.0\/1000 PY; untreated 13.0\/1000 PY; HR 1.08 (0.89 to 1.30), P=0.45\nVertebral NA Treated 2.4\/1000 PY; untreated 2.1\/1000 PY; HR 1.10 (0.69 to 1.76), P=0.68\nHR=hazard ratio; NA=not applicable; PY=person years.\n*Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for patient level covariates of age, sex, study, and use of hormone replacement therapy and bisphosphonate.\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 5 of 8\nWhether calcium is more important in preventing\nfractures than was previously recognised remains to\nbe determined. An individual patient data meta-analy-\nsis is being done on this topic (Mark Bolland, personal\ncommunication, 2009). Calcium and vitamin D are\nlikely to be more effective in attenuating secondary\nhyperparathyroidism, and thus bone turnover and\nbone loss, than is vitamin D alone.22 28 Higher doses\nof vitamin D than were used in the existing trials may\nbe needed to suppress bone turnover if calcium is not\nco-administered.29 We did not have information\nrelated to baseline vitamin D (diet, sunlight, and sup-\nplements) and calcium intake. In most of the included\nstudies, serum vitamin D was measured only in small\nsubgroups. Wide variations are likely, owing to inter-\nnational differences in food fortification and differ-\nences in the age and mobility of study populations.\nPrevious reports of protective effects of calcium and\nvitaminD supplementation in institutionalisedpopula-\ntions and lack of effect in non-institutionalised popula-\ntions suggest that such differences strongly modify the\nanti-fracture efficacy of calcium with vitamin D.915\nWithin the vitamin D with calcium trials, only the\nlower vitamin D dose (10 \u03bcg daily) produced a reduc-\ntion inhip fracture risk. This is not evidence that a 20\u03bcg\ndaily dose is inferior to a 10 \u03bcg daily dose but may\nreflect the fact that the trials of 20 \u03bcg vitamin D with\ncalcium attempted to provide fracture prevention at a\nthreefold higher risk level for hip fractures than did\nstudies using the lower dose (table 2). Thus, our recom-\nmendation would be to use a vitamin D dose of at least\n10 \u03bcg (400 IU) daily combined with 1000 mg of cal-\ncium. In high risk patients, this should be supplemen-\nted by bisphosphonates or other anti-osteoporotic\ndrugs in accordance with national and international\nguidelines.\nStrengths and limitations\nWe were unable to obtain data for four of the 11 iden-\ntified studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Our\nfindings support and further substantiate previous\nmeta-analyses of study level data that included these\nstudies.11 13 26 The results of our analysis were robust\nin effect size and direction to the exclusion of very\nlarge contributing studies.\nWe restricted the analysis to 36 months, as only the\nWHI studywasofmaterially longer duration.With our\ncurrent knowledge on reversal of secondary hyper-\nparathyroidism, this time frame seems reasonable\nThe lack of anti-fracture efficacy seen in the Smith\ntrial has been suggested to be due to low bioavailability\nof the preparation.20 However, although removing this\nstudy from the analysis (fig 5) nominally changed the\nanti-fracture effect of the vitaminD only studies from a\nsmall increase to a small decrease in risk, both results\nfailed to achieve statistical significance.\nWe could not obtain sufficient information about\ncompliance to do a per protocol analysis. The effect\nsize should thus be considered as worst case. We had,\nhowever, pre-specified an intention to treat analysis as\nthe primary hypothesis test for this study, allowing the\neffect size of this intervention to be compared with the\neffect sizes of interventions such as prevention of falls\nand anti-resorptive drugs.\nThe Larsen trial was very influential in the analysis\nfor hip fracture but differed greatly from other studies\nin design by being randomised only at the level of\nhome care districts and by using a factorial design\nthat included drug review, leaflets, and other environ-\nmental interventions.24 As we had access to patient\nlevel information, we were able to repeat the hip frac-\nture analyses without the environmental intervention\narms. However, the calcium and vitamin D arm still\ndiffered from the untreated arm in having the offer of\na drug review. Removing the environmental arms of\nthe Larsen study did not alter the effect size of the joint\nanalysis.\nOnly a single study\u2014the Meyer study\u2014provided\ndata for vitamin D given alone at the lower dose. The\nbiological equivalence of ergocalciferol and cholecal-\nciferol doses remains controversial.25 Results, how-\never, were similar whether the potency of\nergocalciferol was considered to be 100% or 50% of\nthat of cholecalciferol.

Additional studies would be\nneeded to clarifywhether the failure of standalone vita-\nmin D in preventing fractures is due to the route of\nadministration, the long time interval between doses,\nthe nature of the vitaminDpreparation, or the propen-\nsity for studies of vitamin D to enrol participants of\nhigher age and greater fracture risk than do studies of\ncalcium and vitamin D. Although our analysis did not\nprovide support for any interactionwith age or fracture\nhistory, we cannot distinguish between effects of com-\npound, route, and regimen, as studies of intramuscular\nadministration never used daily dosing, whereas cal-\ncium and vitamin D studies always used oral adminis-\ntration and invariably used daily dosing.\nWe had to make allowance for differences between\nstudies in available parameters\u2014for example, no data\non fracture history were available in the Lyons study,18\nand no data on incident clinical vertebral fractures\nwere available in the Meyer study.19 We saw no inter-\naction, however, between treatment effect and fracture\nhistory in six studies with available data. Studying\nadverse events was beyond the scope of this analysis\nand would have been difficult to interpret, as the\nmethod of tracking differed more widely between stu-\ndies than did reporting of fracture outcomes.\nThe important strength of this analysis is that we\nwere able to calculate absolute fracture rates and treat-\nment effects across a wide range of study participants\nand interventions, adjust effects for previous fractures\nand for the use of bisphosphonates and hormone\nreplacement therapy at the level of the individual par-\nticipant, account for interactions and study heteroge-\nneity, and further substantiate the conclusions of non-\nindividual patient data meta-analyses.\nConclusions and policy implications\nDaily calcium and vitaminD supplementation, even at\ndoses as low as 10 \u03bcg of vitamin D daily, significantly\nreduces the risk of fracture, with incidence curves\ndeviating after about 16 months. Fracture prevention\nseemed to be homogeneous across a wide age range\nand was unmodified by fracture history or sex. We\nmust emphasise that this analysis does not allow for a\ndirect comparison of vitamin D against vitamin D\ngiven with calcium, but only comparisons between\neach intervention and no treatment. Whether inter-\nmittent doses of vitamin D given without calcium\nsupplements can reduce the risk of fractures remains\nunresolved from the studies in this analysis. Additional\nstudies of vitaminD are also needed, especially trials of\nvitamin D given daily at higher doses without calcium.\nWe are grateful to the authors of the original trial reports: G B Smedshaug,\nE Kvaavik, J A Falch, A Tverdal, J I Pedersen, H Raphael, P Maslin, S Crozier, E\nR Larsen, A Foldspang, A M Grant, M K Campbell, A M McDonald, G\nS MacLennan, G C McPherson, C Donaldson, W J Gillespie, C M J Robinson, W\nA Wallace, M Gass, R B Wallace, C E Lewis, T Bassford, S A Beresford, H\nR Black, P Blanchette, D E Bonds, R L Brunner, R G Brzyski, B Caan, J A Cauley,\nR T Chlebowski, S R Cummings, I Granek, J Hays, G Heiss, S L Hendrix, B\nV Howard, J Hsia, F A Hubbell, K C Johnson, H Judd, J M Kotchen, L H Kuller, R\nD Langer, N L Lasser, M C Limacher, S Ludlam, J E Manson, K L Margolis,\nJ McGowan, J K Ockene, M J O\u2019Sullivan, L Phillips, R L Prentice, G E Sarto, M\nL Stefanick, L Van Horn, E Whitlock, G L Anderson, A R Assaf, D Barad, R\nA Lyons, S Brophy, R G Newcombe, C J Phillips, B Lervy, R Evans, M D Stone,\nK Wareham, J Porthouse, S Cockayne, C King, L Saxon, E Steele, T Aspray,\nM Baverstock, Y Birks, J Dumville, C Iglesias, S Puffer, A Sutcliffe, and I Watt.\nWe thank the WHI investigators and staff for their dedication and the study\nparticipants for making the programme possible.
