INTRODUCTION\nSince the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) was realized in trapped dilute atomic gases\nat ultra-low temperature, theoretical studies of the BEC have been rapidly developing.\nIn the early stage of study, ultra-cold alkali atoms such as 87Rb and 23Na were mainly\nused for a formation of the BEC. Many theoretical analyses were performed with the Gross-\nPitaevskii (GP) equation, in which the two-body interaction takes a delta-function form.\nIn fact, the two-dimensional GP equation is suitable particularly for the study of the BEC\nmade of alkali atoms in a cylindrical trap, where the s-wave scattering is dominant.\nThanks to recent experimental developments, non-alkali atoms and molecules were also\ncooled down to form the BEC. Such an example is seen in the condensate of Cr atoms [1]. The\ninter-atomic potential in the BEC made of Cr atoms cannot be approximated exclusively\nby the delta function because of the strong dipole moment carried by a Cr atom [2, 3].\nTherefore, the dipole-dipole interaction (including a tensor force) could be also responsible\nfor the many-body dynamics, which involves the d-wave scattering in the BEC. Another\nexample is the condensate of molecules [4], where the delta function is not appropriate for\nthe intermolecular interaction because of the anisotropic nature of the interaction.\nThe BEC can be rotated with the state-of-the-art experimental techniques, such as the\nlaser spoon [5]. Owing to these techniques, it was demonstrated that the BEC undergoes the\nquantum phase transition to vortex states. The \u201ccranked\u201d GP equation was applied to the\nanalysis of the rotating BEC, and it successfully explained the quantum phase transition,\nincluding the triangular lattice of vortices [6, 7]. In the early stage of the study of the\nrotating BEC, the two-dimensional GP equation was mainly used for theoretical analyses\n[8], because the BEC was only rotated about the fixed axis.\nRecently observed phenomena, such as precession [9, 10] and bending [11] of vortices,\nrequire the rotational axis to move around in a time-dependent manner, with respect to a\ncertain coordinate frame. These phenomena attract much interest in terms of the three-\ndimensional spatial structures of the vortex states. Hence, the three-dimensional GP equa-\ntion is now being applied to various vortex states [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. In addition, a topo-\nlogical technique was developed to produce vortices with spin 2 or 4 (~), by reversing the\nmagnetic field of the trap [17, 18]. (Below, we take the unit for angular momentum to be\n~ = 1.) The formation mechanism of such vortices requires three-dimensional motion of the\n2\nvortices. In these situations, the total angular momentum vector needs to be treated in a\nthree-dimensional manner.\nIn this way, everytime new experimental progresses are achieved, new physical situations\nare created, to which the original GP equation cannot be applied in a naive way. The\ncranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (cranked HFB) method, which has been used to describe\nrotational states of atomic nuclei [19, 20], could be a useful and powerful approach in order\nto deal with these new situations.\nRotating BEC systems in a trap has been analyzed with the GP equation, or the exact\ndiagonalization method using a set of the truncated basis. Mottelson was the first to discuss\nthe \u201cyrast\u201d structure [21]. Here, the yrast states mean the lowest-energy states for given\nangular momentum. He proposed a scenario [22] that the quadrupole excitation is dominant\nwhen the total angular momentum L is much less than the particle number N (L << N),\nand that all the bosonic particles will occupy the p state when the total angular momentum\nbecomes equal to the particle number. This situation can be interpreted as a creation of\na vortex state. This prediction was numerically verified by himself and his collaborators\nusing the two-dimensional GP equation [23]. Bertsch and Papenbrock also verified this\nprediction using the diagonalization of the two-dimensional model Hamiltonian [25, 26].\nFurther detailed analysis was performed by Nakajima et. al.[27].\nIn this paper, we apply the cranked HFB method to a simple schematic model, where\nbosonic particles interact weakly through the repulsive quadrupole-quadrupole interaction.\nThis model is too simple to describe the detailed structure of realistic systems. But, in\nlimited situations, the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction becomes a phenomenologically\nvalid interaction that can reflect physically essential properties of the realistic interaction.\nFor example, our model can describe low-energy rotational excitations of weakly interacting\nalkali atoms, as discussed by Mottelson [22]. Then, using the density matrix of the yrast\nstates, as well as its eigenvalues and eigenstates, we compare our results with the other\nmethods. Creation of a vortex state is also discussed within the framework of our model.\nIn Sections II and III, we present how the cranked HFB theory is extended so as to\ncalculate not only fermionic systems but also bosonic ones. Unlike the GP equation, we do\nnot assume the inter-atomic potential to be the delta function. Also, we do not suppose an\na priori existence of the condensate, which is the essential assumption in the GP equation.\nThe cranked HFB theory is a constrained mean-field theory, and the value and direction of\n3\nthe total angular momentum vector are controlled in the calculation. With this method, it is\nexpected that we can numerically analyze not only structure of dilute many-boson systems\nin a trap, but also superfluidity produced by ultra-cold many-fermion systems in a trap.\nIn the present study, we focus on the study of weakly interacting Bose systems, and an\napplication of the cranked HFB theory to a simple model is presented in Sections IV and V.\nII. CRANKED HARTREE-FOCK-BOGOLIUBOV THEORY\nWe describe the cranked HFB method that can be applied to rotating particles interacting\ntwo-body interactions. This method was originally proposed for a description of nuclear\nrotation [19, 20], but we extend the method to deal with not only fermions but bosons.\nLet c\u2020\u03b1, c\u03b1 be the creation and annihilation operators of the single particle state \u3008\u03be|\u03b1\u3009 =\n\u03c8\u03b1(\u03be), where \u03be represents the real-space coordinates, spin coordinates and nuclear spin of\nparticles. The creation and annihilation operators of quasi-particle a\u2020i , ai is given by the\nBogoliubov-Valatin transformation [28, 29],\na\u2020i =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\nU\u03b1ic\n\u2020\n\u03b1 + V\u03b1ic\u03b1, (1)\nai =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\nU\u2217\u03b1ic\u03b1 + V\n\u2217\n\u03b1ic\n\u2020\n\u03b1. (2)\nThe operators ai, c\u03b1 obey the following commutation rule,\n[ai, a\n\u2020\nj ]\u00b1 = \u03b4ij, [a\n\u2020\ni , a\n\u2020\nj ]\u00b1 = [ai, aj]\u00b1 = 0, (3)[\nc\u03b1, c\n\u2020\n\u03b2\n]\n\u00b1\n= \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2, [c\n\u2020\n\u03b1, c\n\u2020\n\u03b2]\u00b1 = [c\u03b1, c\u03b2]\u00b1 = 0,\nwhere the upper sign (+) applies to fermions and the lower (\u2212) to bosons. To satisfy the\ncommutation rule (3), we need the following relations.\nU \u2020U \u00b1 V \u2020V = 1, UTU\u2217 \u00b1 V TV \u2217 = 1, (4)\nU \u2020V \u2217 \u00b1 V \u2020U\u2217 = 0, V TU \u00b1 UTV = 0. (5)\nBased on the variational principle, the U and V are determined. The variational ansatz is\nchosen to be\n|\u03a6\u3009 = Nf exp(\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u03b2\n1\n2\nf\u03b1\u03b2c\n\u2020\n\u03b1c\n\u2020\n\u03b2)|0\u3009, f\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\u2211\ni\nV\u03b1i(U\n\u2217\u22121)i\u03b2, (6)\n4\nwhere, Nf is a normalization constant and |0\u3009 is the true vacuum. The variational state |\u03a6\u3009\ncorresponds to the vacuum in the quasi-particle basis, that is, ai|\u03a6\u3009 = 0. The many-body\nHamiltonian including a two-body interaction V (\u03be1, \u03be2) is generally written as\nH\u02c6 =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u03b2\nH0\u03b1\u03b2c\n\u2020\n\u03b1c\u03b2 +\n1\n4\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nV\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4c\u2020\u03b1c\u2020\u03b2c\u03b4c\u03b3 , (7)\nwhere V\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 is given by\nV\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4\u03b3 = \u3008\u03c8\u03b1(\u03be1)\u03c8\u03b2(\u03be2)|V (\u03be1, \u03be2)|\u03c8\u03b3(\u03be1)\u03c8\u03b4(\u03be2))\u3009\u2213\u3008\u03c8\u03b1(\u03be1)\u03c8\u03b2(\u03be2)|V (\u03be1, \u03be2)|\u03c8\u03b4(\u03be1)\u03c8\u03b3(\u03be2))\u3009. (8)\nThe one-body part H0\u03b1\u03b2 includes the kinetic energy and the spherical confinement potential.\nUsing Wick\u2019s theorem, we can represent the Hamiltonian (7) by the total energy E and the\none-body Hamiltonian h\u02c6, as\nH\u02c6 = E + h\u02c6+\n1\n4\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nV\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 : c\u2020\u03b1c\u2020\u03b2c\u03b4c\u03b3 :, (9)\nE =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u03b2\nH0\u03b1\u03b2\u3008c\u2020\u03b1c\u03b2\u3009+\n1\n4\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nV\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4(\u3008c\u03b4c\u03b3\u3009\u3008c\u2020\u03b1c\u2020\u03b2\u3009+ \u3008c\u2020\u03b1c\u2020\u03b2\u3009\u3008c\u03b4c\u03b3\u3009+ 2\u3008c\u2020\u03b1c\u03b3\u3009\u3008c\u2020\u03b2c\u03b4\u3009), (10)\nh\u02c6 =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u03b2\nH0\u03b1\u03b2 : c\n\u2020\n\u03b1c\u03b2 : +\n1\n4\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\nV\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4(\u3008c\u03b4c\u03b3\u3009 : c\u2020\u03b1c\u2020\u03b2 : +\u3008c\u2020\u03b1c\u2020\u03b2\u3009 : c\u03b4c\u03b3 : +2\u3008c\u2020\u03b1c\u03b3\u3009 : c\u2020\u03b2c\u03b4 :),(11)\nwhere : \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 : is the normal order product with respect to a, a\u2020 and an abbreviated expression\nis introduced for an expectation value, \u3008O\u3009 = \u3008\u03a6|O|\u03a6\u3009.\nThe HFB wavefunction |\u03a6\u3009 is determined through the variational principle with con-\nstraints C\u02c6n,\n\u03b4\u3008\u03a6|H\u02c6 \u2212\n\u2211\nn\n\u00b5nC\u02c6n|\u03a6\u3009 = 0, (12)\nwhere \u00b5n is a Lagrange multiplier. In this method, three components of the total angular\nmomentum and the particle number are constrained. Further constraints are imposed on\nthe following quadrupole operators, B\u02c61 =\n\u221a\n15\n2pi\nyz, B\u02c62 =\n\u221a\n15\n2pi\nzx, B\u02c63 =\n\u221a\n15\n2pi\nxy, in order to\nfix the intrinsic coordinate axes of the system along the principal axes of the quadrupole\nmoments. Therefore, we have seven constraints in our calculations.\n\u3008\u03a6|J\u02c6x|\u03a6\u3009 = Jx, \u3008\u03a6|J\u02c6y|\u03a6\u3009 = Jy, \u3008\u03a6|J\u02c6z|\u03a6\u3009 = Jz, (13)\n\u3008\u03a6|B\u02c61|\u03a6\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u03a6|B\u02c62|\u03a6\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u03a6|B\u02c63|\u03a6\u3009 = 0, (14)\n\u3008\u03a6|N\u02c6 |\u03a6\u3009 = N, (15)\n5\nIn Eq.(12), these constraints are represented with C\u02c6n\u2019s as C\u02c61 = J\u02c6x, C\u02c62 = J\u02c6y, C\u02c63 = J\u02c6z, C\u02c64 =\nB\u02c61, C\u02c65 = B\u02c62, C\u02c66 = B\u02c63, C\u02c67 = N\u02c6 . In particular, the term \u2212\n\u22113\nn=1 \u00b5nC\u02c6n has been called the\n\u201ccranking term\u201d in nuclear high-spin physics, because it simulates the effect of the Coriolis\nforce in the rotating mean-field system.\nIII. METHOD OF STEEPEST DESCENT\nAs mentioned earlier, we determine the HFB states, following the variational principle.\nBy multiplying a unitary operator to an arbitrary initial HFB state |\u03a6\u3009, another HFB state\n|\u03a6\u2032\u3009 is obtained. This transformation is considered as a variational procedure with respect to\nthe matrices U and V of the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation, Eq.(2). The transformation\nis iterated until a local minimum is found to satisfy Eq.(12).\nNow, let us explain how the unitary operator is given within our framework. First of all,\nfrom the extended Thouless theorem [30, 31], the unitary transformation of the HFB state\nis expressed as\n|\u03a6\u2032\u3009 = exp(d\u02c6)|\u03a6\u3009, (16)\nwhere d\u02c6 is an anti-Hermitian operator d\u02c6 = \u2212d\u02c6\u2020, which is generally expressed as,\nd\u02c6 =\n1\n2\n\u2211\nij\n(\ndija\n\u2020\nia\n\u2020\nj \u2212 d\u2217ijajai\n)\n. (17)\nA quasi-particle basis is then transformed in the following way.\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed a\u2032\u2020i\na\u2032i\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed e\u2212d\u02c6a\u2020ied\u02c6\ne\u2212d\u02c6aie\nd\u02c6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 = exp(\u00b1D)T\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed a\u2020i\nai\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (18)\nwhere\nD =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 0 d\nd\u2217 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (19)\nand d is a matrix representation of d\u02c6. We choose the anti-Hermite operator d\u02c6 as,\nd\u02c6 = [\u03b7r\u02c6 + s\u02c6]a, (20)\nwhere we define [O\u02c6]a = 1\n2\n[N\u02c6 , O\u02c6] and the quasi-particle number operator is given as N\u02c6 =\n6\n\u2211\ni a\n\u2020\niai. An operator s\u02c6 and the single-particle Routhian r\u02c6 are respectively defined as\ns\u02c6 =\n\u2211\nn\n\u03b4nC\u02c6n, (21)\nr\u02c6 = h\u02c6\u2212\n\u2211\nn\n\u00b5nC\u02c6n. (22)\nThen, these parameters \u03b7, \u03b4n, and \u00b5n are determined through a minimization of \u3008\u03a6\u2032|H\u02c6|\u03a6\u2032\u3009\nunder the constraints \u3008\u03a6|C\u02c6i|\u03a6\u3009 = ci. The parameters \u03b4n and \u00b5n are evaluated by expanding\n\u3008\u03a6\u2032|C\u02c6i|\u03a6\u2032\u3009 up to the first order in \u03b4n and \u00b5n.

Whereas, the parameter \u03b7 is determined from a minimization\ncondition for E = \u3008\u03a6\u2032|H\u02c6|\u03a6\u2032\u3009, through expanding E up to the second order in \u03b7.

(25)\nTo check the convergence for the self-consistency in the calculation, it is convenient to\ndefine the norm of d as |d| =\n\u221a\u2211\nij\n1\n2\n|dij|2. In our calculations, a criterion for the convergence\nis given whether |d| is less or greater than \u01eb = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22127. When |d| < \u01eb, we judge that\nthe convergence is numerically achieved. Otherwise, the iteration for the self-consistency\ncontinue until |d| meets the above condition.\nIV. A SCHEMATIC MODEL\nTo examine the convergence procedure of our method (3D-cranked HFB) for the bosonic\ncase, let us consider a toy model, which is similar to a realistic system of dilute ultra-cold\nBose gases confined by an isotropic harmonic oscillator potential V (r) = 1\n2\nM\u03c92r2, where\nM represents the atomic mass. We choose the single-particle states to be the harmonic\noscillator states, \u3008r|\u03b1\u3009 = \u3008r|c\u2020\u03b1|0\u3009 = Rn\u03b1l\u03b1(r)il\u03b1Yl\u03b1m\u03b1(\u03b8\u03c6), that is, a product of the Laguerre\npolynomial and the spherical harmonics. Let us denote this basis as \u03b1 \u2261 (n\u03b1, l\u03b1, m\u03b1).\nMottelson discussed that the quadrupole correlation is important in the low angular\nmomentum region [22]. In accordance with his proposition, the following Hamiltonian is\n7\nconsidered in our calculations.\nH\u02c6model = H\u02c60 +\n1\n2\n\u03ba\n2\u2211\n\u00b5=\u22122\n(\u2212)\u00b5Q\u02c6\u2212\u00b5Q\u02c6\u00b5 + gP\u02c6 \u2020P\u02c6 , (26)\nH\u02c60 =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\n(2n\u03b1 + l\u03b1 +\n3\n2\n)~\u03c9\u03b4c\u2020\u03b1c\u03b1, (27)\nQ\u02c6\u00b5 =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u3008\u03b1|2r2C(2)\u00b5 |\u03b2\u3009c\u2020\u03b1c\u03b2, (28)\nP\u02c6 =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\n\u221a\n2l\u03b1 + 1\u3008l\u03b1m\u03b1l\u03b1 \u2212m\u03b1|00\u3009c\u03b1\u00afc\u03b1, (29)\nwhere c\u03b1\u00af is the annihilation operator corresponding to the state \u03b1\u00af = (n\u03b1, l\u03b1,\u2212m\u03b1), and\nC\n(k)\n\u03ba (\u2126) is related to the spherical harmonics through C\n(k)\n\u03ba (\u2126) =\n\u221a\n4pi\n2k+1\nYk\u03ba(\u2126). This Hamil-\ntonian should be considered as a simple model for weakly interacting dilute atomic gases.\nThe parameter \u03ba represents strength of the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction, and \u03ba is\npositive in this work, to treat the repulsive two-body interaction. The last term of Eq. (26)\nis called the pairing interaction. [24] The parameter g represents the strength of the pairing\ninteraction. In the present calculation, we set g to be zero, for the sake of simplicity. The\none-body Hamiltonian (11) in this model is given as,\nh\u02c6model = H\u02c60 + \u03ba\n\u2211\n\u00b5\n(\u2212)\u00b5\u3008Q\u02c6\u2212\u00b5\u3009Q\u02c6\u00b5 + g\u3008P\u02c6 \u2020\u3009P\u02c6 . (30)\nThe oscillator energy for the isotropic harmonic oscillator states, ~\u03c9, is set to 1.9 (meV).\nThe quadrupole-quadrupole interaction \u03ba\/A2 is repulsive and its strength is set to 0.1, 0.5\nand 1.0 (meV\/\u00b5m4), where A is the mass number of an atom. The single-particle model\nspace used in this calculation are the harmonic oscillator states of the 0s, 1s, 0d, 2s, 1d, 0g,\n0p, 1p, 0f, 2p, 1f and 0h states.\nTo prepare the initial state, we use the deformed quadrupole mean field.\nh\u02c6deform = H\u02c60 \u2212 2\n3\nM\u03c92r2\n(\n\u03b2 cos \u03b3C\n(2)\n0 (\u2126) +\n1\u221a\n2\n\u03b2 sin \u03b3(C\n(2)\n2 (\u2126) + C\n(2)\n\u22122 (\u2126))\n)\n. (31)\nThe quadrupole parameters (\u03b2, \u03b3) are useful measures to think about the shape of the\nmany-body system. \u03b2 is a measure for elongation or stretching, while \u03b3 for triaxiality or\ndeviation from axial symmetry. For example, a spherical shape has \u03b2 = 0 and nuclear\nsuperdeformation has typically \u03b2 \u2243 0.6. The triaxial parameter \u03b3 gives axial shapes when\n\u03b3 = 0\u25e6 and \u03b3 = 60\u25e6. The former shape corresponds to the so-called \u201cprolate\u201dshape, which\n8\nis similar to a kiwifruit, while the latter to \u201coblate\u201d shape, similar to a mandarin orange.\nBy definition, a triaxial shape is invariant with respect to an operation: \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 + 120\u25e6.\nWe diagonalize the Hamiltonian (31) for (\u03b2, \u03b3) = (0.01, 0) and obtain the single-particle\nstates. The initial state is created as a Hartree-Fock state, that is, all the single-particle\nlevels are occupied below the Fermi level.\nSince the initial state is symmetric under rotation about the z-axis, collective rotation\nabout the z-axis is suppressed. In other words, we cannot crank the state around the symme-\ntry axis. To induce angular momentum, we initially set the constraints of the total angular\nmomentum to (Jx, Jy, Jz) = (0.05, 0, 0). As a next step, we tilt the angular momentum\nvector to (Jx, Jy, Jz) = (0, 0, 0.1). With this procedure, we can increase Jz up to 20, with a\nstep, \u2206Jz = 0.05.\nV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nFigure 1 represents the total energy E as a function of the total angular momentum L.\nFour lines are plotted in this figure. One dotted line represents ~\u03c9(L+ 3\n2\nN) and the other\nthree lines are calculated with the different quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strengths,\nwhich are \u03ba\/A2 = 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 (meV\/\u00b5m4). Despite the different values for \u03ba, These\nlines are nearly identical. In other words, E is almost independent of \u03ba.\nWe also find that E increases almost in proportion to L, that is, E \u221d L. This result can be\nexplained from a microscopic point of view. As L is increased, single-particle excitations are\ninduced one by one through the two-body interaction, so as to satisfy the angular momentum\nconstraints. In other words, \u2206E = ~\u03c9\u2206L, where ~\u03c9 is the single-particle energy spacing of\nthe isotropic harmonic oscillator. Due to the quantum statistics for bosons, this excitation\nmode can continue until the number of particles occupying the ground state becomes zero.\nThis linear behavior is already noticed by other authors [25]. However, with a careful look\nat our numerical result, there is a slight deviation from the linearity in the the total energy\n(~\u03c9(L+ 3\n2\nN)). This small deviation is caused by deformation of the mean field, which has\na role to mix the single-particle orbits. The evolution of the quadrupole deformation in\nresponse to rotation is discussed below.\nFigure 2 shows the deformation parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3. The strengths of the interaction are\nset in the same manner as in Figure 1. These deformation parameters are self-consistently\n9\ncalculated as\n\u03b2 =\n3\u03ba\nM\u03c92\n\u221a\n\u3008Q20\u30092 + 2\u3008Q22\u30092, (32)\n\u03b3 = tan\u22121\n\u3008Q22\u3009\u221a\n2\u3008Q20\u3009\n. (33)\nThe unit for the quadrupole moment (M\u03c92\/\u03ba) is derived from the consistency at L = 0\nbetween the one-body Hamiltonian (30) and the deformed mean-field Hamiltonian (31). The\nfigure shows that the deformation parameters do not depend on the interaction strength very\nmuch, although \u03b3 shows minor differences at low spin. When the total angular momentum\nis small (L . 1), the mean field has a almost spherical shape. This is because the trapping\npotential is spherical and the present two-body interaction is repulsive. As L is increased, \u03b2\nincreases gradually. In the small angular momentum region (L < 5 ), \u03b3 is not 180\u25e6(\u2261 60\u25e6).\n(See the right panel of Figure 2.) This result means that the shape of the mean field is\nnot axial-symmetric, but triaxial. When the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction becomes\nstronger, the deformation tends to prefer a more triaxial-deformed shape. However, any\nof the three cases ends up with the oblate shape (\u03b3 = 180\u25e6) at high angular momentum\n(L & 5). A reason for this tendency can be explained as the following: When the quadrupole-\nquadrupole interaction is strong, the harmonic oscillator states having the different magnetic\nquantum numbers become more mixed through the interaction. As a result, the magnetic\nquantum number is no longer a good quantum number. This is nothing but axial symmetry\nbreaking, or an emergence of triaxiality. It should be noted, however, that \u03b3 is substantial\nonly at low angular momentum, where \u03b2 is very small. In other words, when the elongation\nis small (\u03b2 \u2243 0), the triaxial degree of freedom is irrelevant in terms of a deviation from a\nspherical shape. That is, in our calculation, the shape of the mean field can be regarded\nto be almost spherical in the small L region. On the other hand, for the higher angular\nmomentum region (L > 5), \u03b3 is almost constant to be 180\u25e6, meaning that the mean field\nbecomes an oblate shape.\nThe condition for the BEC of weakly interacting bosonic atoms in a trap is given by\nNv\/~\u03c9 << 1 [22], where v is an expectation value of the two-body interaction, while\n~\u03c9 represents the single-particle level spacing. In our calculation, Nv corresponds to an\nexpectation value of the quadrupole-quadrupole force, that is, \u03ba(\u3008Q20\u30092+2\u3008Q22\u30092). The ratio\nNv\/~\u03c9 is then estimated to be 4.4\u00d7 10\u22123\u03b2A2\/\u03ba. According to our calculation, deformation\nis up to \u03b2 . 1, so that the ratio is of order of 10\u22124 to 10\u22125 for our three choices of the\n10\ninteraction strength (\u03ba\/A2 = 0.1, 0.5, 1 meV\/\u00b5m4). This result means that our calculations\ncan be regarded as a weakly interacting many-boson system.\nFigure 3 shows the occupation probability, \u03c1\u03b1\u03b1 for \u03ba\/A\n2 = 0.1 meV\/\u00b5m4, where \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 is\nthe density matrix defined as\n\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\u2211\ni\nV \u2217\u03b1iV\u03b2i. (34)\n(V is a matrix appearing in the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation, Eq.(2).) Although\nthe occupation probabilities for \u03ba\/A=0.5, 1 meV\/\u00b5m4 are not plotted in Figure 3, we have\ncalculated these occupation probabilities and found that they are almost same as that of\n\u03ba\/A2 = 0.1 meV\/\u00b5m4. This result indicates that the wave-function does not strongly depend\non the strength of the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction.\nAt low L, the (0s0) states are the major component in the HFB state. The higher the\ntotal angular momentum, the more the (0d2) state admixes with the (0s0) state. The (0g2)\ncomponent is also mixed at L \u2243 2N = 20, while the (0s0) component vanishes. This result\nsuggests that the yrast state changes its structure gradually.\nFigure 4 shows the eigenvalue \u03bda of the density matrix \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 , as a function of L. Only the\nplot for \u03ba\/A2 = 0.1 (meV\/\u00b5m4) is displayed because the occupation is almost independent\nof \u03ba\/A2. The largest eigenvalue in the figure is equal to the total particle number N = 10,\nand this situation happens only at L = 0 and 2N(= 20) In these cases, all the particles\noccupy only one single-particle state, which can be regarded as the condensate state. On\nthe other hand, between L = 0 and 2N (0 < L < 2N = 20), the particles are shared by the\ntwo states \u03c8A and \u03c8B, where \u03bdA+\u03bdB = N = 10. This result indicates that most of the yrast\nstates are non-condensates, but a mixture of two single-particle components, \u03c8A and \u03c8B.\nIn Figure 5, the eigenstates \u03c8A and \u03c8B are decomposed into the single-particle basis,\nand their components are displayed in terms of probability (va\u03b1)\n2, where |\u03c8a\u3009 = \u2211\u03b1 va\u03b1|\u03b1\u3009.\nFirst, as shown in the right panel of the figure, the state \u03c8A at L = 0 is found to have a\ncondensate structure into the (0s0) state, which is consistent with the occupation number\ncalculation shown in Figure 3. As L is increased, the (0d0) component starts to mix with\nthe s component although the contribution from the d state is minor. This mixture is\nconsistent with the growth of the quadrupole deformation, as shown in the left panel of\nFigure 2. When L . 5, axial symmetry is broken around the cranking axis, as shown\nin Figure 2. In this situation, the whole system rotates in a collective manner, which is\n11\nconsistent with Mottelson\u2019s model claiming that the yrast structure is dominated by the\ncollective quadrupole excitation at low L. Such a collective rotation was actually observed\nexperimentally at lower rotational frequency before vortices are formed [32]. However, the\nlinear dependence of E on L at low L seen in Figure 1 implies that the collective mode is\nnot the major mode in our model, but that the single-particle excitations are. Next, in the\nright panel of Figure 5, the state \u03c8B is decomposed into the d and g states. This is because\nthe quadrupole-quadrupole interaction does not mix the states having different parity, so\nthat the particles in the s state can not be excited to the p state, but the d or g states. The\nmajor component is the (0d2) state when angular momentum is small (L . 10), whereas the\n(0g2) state starts to mix in the high angular momentum region (L > 10), due to the onset\nof deformation in the mean field. Although the (0g4) state is included already at L \u2243 0, this\ncomponent can be considered as a minor component because the occupation \u03bdB is nearly 0\nin this region.\nAccording to the previous discussion, at L = 2N , the many-body state goes into the\ncondensate in the state \u03c8B, which is a mixture of the (0d2) and (0g2) states. Both of these\n(0d2) and (0g2) states have angular dependence sin2 \u03b8, so that the density along the z-axis\nvanishes for these states. Therefore, the condensate at L = 2N is considered as a quantized\nvortex state carrying 2 (~).\nThe HFB solutions obtained for the intermediate L values (0 < L < 20) are quite different\nfrom the solutions obtained with the GP equation. This is because the GP equation assumes\nan a priori existence of the condensate for the whole range of L, which can be expressed\nas a Hartree state, (a\u20200)\nN |0\u3009. Although our HFB ansatz includes this condensate state as\na special case, the mathematical form for the HFB state is generally more complicated to\nallow a linear combination form of multiple Hartree states, in accordance with Eq. (6). If\nthe condensate is realized at any L, all the particles should occupy the one single-particle\nstate that is generally expressed by a liner combination of the basis states, such as the s, d\nand g states.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the yrast structure changes smoothly from the \u03c8A-dominant states\nto the \u03c8B-dominant state, as L is increased from 0 to 2N . Considering that the latter state\nat L = 2N corresponds to a vortex state, a formation of the vortex starts as a shallow dent\nin the center at small L. As the amplitude of \u03c8B becomes larger for increasing L, the depth\nof the dent becomes deeper. Finally at L = 2N , a complete vortex is formed, where density\n12\nbecomes zero. This mechanism of the vortex formation is very different from the one derived\nfrom the GP equation. In the calculations using the GP equation [6], a vortex enters from\nthe \u201coutside\u201d of the system due to a continuity of the many-body wave function. This sort\nof process needs a odd-number multipolarities, such as a dipole (\u03bb = 1) and an octupole\n(\u03bb = 3) correlations, which are missing from our present model.\nThese higher multipole correlations may play an important role also in a formation of\nvortex lattices, which violates rotational symmetry of the system. In the present framework,\nvortices appear always in the center of the system due to the axial symmetry possessed by\nthe system. To allow multiple vortices to appear away from the center, we need, at least, a\nmixing between these states of (0s0), (0d2) and (0g2) to break the symmetry. This situation\nis realized only when \u3008Q2\u00b12\u3009, which is contained in the single-particle Hamiltonian, Eq.(30),\nis non-zero. In other words, the deformation parameter \u03b3 should not be equal to 0\u25e6 or 180\u25e6\nto allow triaxial deformation bringing anisotropy to the system. However, in the present\ncalculations, \u03b3 takes the value of 180\u25e6 in a wide range of angular momentum (5 < L < 20).\nConsequently, the vortex lattice is not produced in our model.\nVI. SUMMARY\nExtending the 3D-cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method, we have performed the nu-\nmerical calculation for a rotating many-boson system interacting through a weak and re-\npulsive interaction, trapped inside an isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Unlike the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, our calculation does not assume the existence of the condensate\na priori, but general many-body states in the framework of the HFB method.\nWe applied the method to a simple model where the two-body interaction is chosen to be\na separable type called the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. Parity is conserved for this\ninteraction, so that only \u2206l = 2 excitations is allowed through the quadrupole-quadrupole\ninteraction.\nFirst of all, at L = 0, our calculation shows that the HFB state is interpreted as a\ncondensate into (0s0).\nAs increasing the total angular momentum L from 0 to 20, the particles in the yrast state\ntransfer from \u03c6A to \u03c6B. which have the magnetic quantum numbers Mz = 0 and Mz = 2,\nrespectively. At low L, triaxial deformation is formed to allow collective rotation around the\n13\ncranking axis. However, the linearity E \u221d L implies that the major excitation mode is still\nsingle-particle excitations. At higher L, the system becomes oblate, that is, axial symmetric\naround the rotating axis. Angular momentum is thus produced by migrating from s state\nto d state. These single-particle excitations are induced from the s to the d state through\nthe quadrupole-quadrupole interaction, in agreement with the prediction by Mottelson.\nFinally, at L = 2N , the HFB state becomes another condensate, in which all the particles\noccupy the single state expressed by a linear combination of the (0d2) and (0g2) states. This\nstate can be interpreted as a vortex state having angular momentum 2(~).\nIn this way, the yrast structure changes gradually and smoothly in our framework. This\nresult can be accounted by the following two effects: One is our choice of the HFB ansatz\nwhich allows a linear combination form of multiple Hartree states. The other is the finite-\nnumber effect of the total particle number (N = 10). These effects surely needs further\ninvestigations in the future studies.\nWe are currently proceeding to extend our programming code to deal with more realistic\ninter-atomic potentials, and plan to examine the effect of the pairing interaction in the HFB\nframework.\nVII.
