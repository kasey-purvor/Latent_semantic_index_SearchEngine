UN-\nHABITAT, 2007). Although targeted prescriptions to reduce armed violence are emerging \nfrom multilateral and bilateral agencies, research emphasises how urban violence is highly \nheterogeneous, multi-causal and not readily amenable to reified solutions (Small Arms \nSurvey, 2007; Geneva Declaration, 2008). In particular, interventions designed to promote \nsecurity often overlook the underlying determinants shaping the emergence and severity of \nurban violence, as well as the origins, motivations and means of so-called \u201cviolence \nentrepreneurs\u201d (Collier et al., 2003). This is strikingly the case in relation to urban gangs \nthroughout Central America. Their actions are routinely described as a \u201cnew urban \ninsurgency\u201d that threatens the integrity of governments and needs to be violently crushed (e.g. \nManwaring, 2005; 2006). In some cases, gangs are explicitly connected to the surge in \nviolence that accompanies narco-trafficking (US, 2008; CNN, 2009). This article argues that \nthe reality may in fact be very different. The relationship between Central American urban \ngang violence and state-led attempts at violence reduction is not as straightforward as often \nportrayed.  \n \nThe article is divided into five parts. The opening section presents a panoramic overview of \nurban violence in Central America, emphasising the uneven distribution of urban violence, \nand how violence is conditioned by a range of proximate and structural factors. The next \nsection issues a descriptive review of gangs in contemporary urban Central America, tracing \ntheir origins, their underlying logic, and the ways in which they are socially constructed as a \n\u201cthreat\u201d to public order. The third and fourth sections critically assess so-called first and \nsecond generation violence reduction strategies\u2014known as mano dura (\u201chard hand\u201d) and \nmano amiga (\u201cfriendly hand\u201d) respectively\u2014adopted by public authorities in Central America \nto address urban gangs. The final section then introduces a threefold approach to measuring \nthe effectiveness of gang-related interventions, focusing alternately on discursive, practical \nand outcome-based criteria.2 The analysis highlights how contrarily to their reported success \nin diminishing gang violence, first generation approaches have actually tended to radicalise \nthe gangs, potentially pushing them towards more organised forms of criminality. Meanwhile, \nsecond generation interventions appear to be more rhetorical than practical in nature. \n \nI. Urban Violence in Central America \n \nCentral America features amongst the highest rates of reported homicidal and criminal \nviolence in Latin America and indeed the world. The annual global homicide rate was \napproximately 7 per 100,000 in 2004, while in South America it was 25 per 100,000 and in \nCentral America it soared above 29 per 100,000 (Geneva Declaration, 2008; WHO, 2008; \nUNODC, 2009). In contrast to virtually every other region, South and Central America \nfeature the fastest and most dramatic temporal escalation of (homicidal) armed violence since \n1999. Demographically, the perpetration of (and victimisation by) violence appears to be \n                                                 \n2 This framework for measuring \u2018effectiveness\u2019 is drawn from Muggah and Krause (2006) and their analysis of \npeace support operations in Haiti.  \n 2\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \nconcentrated primarily among young males aged 15 to 34.3 And spatially, statistical \nassessments undertaken by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) have detected that \nhouseholds in cities with more than one million inhabitants were over 70 per cent more likely \nto be victimised than households in cities of between 50,000-100,000 inhabitants (Gaviria & \nPag\u00e9s, 2002: 190). In 2006, for instance, more than 40 per cent of reported homicides in \nGuatemala occurred in Guatemala City, home to less than 20 per cent of the country\u2019s \npopulation (cf. Matute & Garc\u00eda, 2007).  \n \nThis stereotype of young, increasingly violent men in big cities is frequently advanced \nby media and political commentators in order to render causal claims between \nurbanisation, violence, and gangs (Caldeira, 2000). As such, rampant urbanisation is \nsaid to lead to the growth of uncontrollable slums that foster criminal activity, the rise of \ngangs and ultimately, the violence (Brennan-Galvin, 2002; Buvinic & Morrison, 2005). \nEchoing this conventional wisdom, some criminologists and sociologists contend that \nurban density is robustly associated with crime and narco-trafficking since greater \nconcentrations of people inevitably trigger competition over limited resources, \nexpanding stresses and social anomie (Naud\u00e9 et al., 2006: 73; van Dijk, 1998: 63; \nGlaeser & Sacerdote, 1996).4 Human geographers also tend to attribute spiralling rates \nof urban violence to unsustainable urbanisation and the resulting social and ecological \ndisequilibrium (cf. Brennan, 1999).  \n \nNonetheless, there is reason to be cautious about proclaiming an immediate correlation \nbetween city size or density and rates of urban violence (J\u00fctersonke et al., 2007, Rodgers, \nforthcoming b).5 The factors shaping the specific panorama of violence across Central \nAmerica are wide-ranging, and certainly more complex than the simple model proposed \nabove. The World Bank, for example, recently attributed the rise in Central American \nviolence to \u201ca complex set of factors, including rapid urbanization, persistent poverty and \ninequality, social exclusion, political violence, organized crime, post-conflict cultures, the \nemergence of illegal drug use and trafficking and authoritarian family structures\u201d (World \nBank, 2008a: 3). The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC), for its part, \nemphasises the role of geography and weak institutions as aggravating rates of violence; with \nover 80 per cent of the US\u2019s cocaine supply passing through Central America states from \nAndean production centres, it is little wonder that organised crime violence is deeply \nentrenched (UNODC, 2007: 38). For its part, the US government\u2019s Joint Forces Command \nhas honed in on narco-trafficking, weak institutions and porous borders as key factors shaping \nviolence in neighbouring countries (US, 2008). \n \nCrucially, urban violence is both a result of, and a catalyst for, transformations in urban \ngovernance and spatial organisation (see Moser & Rodgers, 2005). In many middle and \nlower-income cities, for example, sections of slums and shantytowns have assumed the \ncharacter of forbidden gang and crime zones beyond the control of public security \n                                                 \n3 Although a worrying spike in violence directed against women is also emerging. For example, Guatemala \nreported more than 560 cases of female homicides registered in 2005, while in Honduras, more than 195 women \nwere murdered during the same period and almost 80 in 2006 (Muggah & Stevenson, forthcoming).\n4 The US government, for example, described the growth of gang and drug related violence in Mexico as an \n\u2018internal conflict\u2019 observing that the \u201cgovernment, its politicians, police, and judicial infrastructure are all under \nsustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels. How that internal conflict turns out over the \nnext several years will have a major impact on the stability of the Mexican state.\u201d See US (2008). \n5 Indeed, a recent global review of more than 67 major cities with populations ranging from 6,000 to 14 million \npersons revealed few clear patterns or trends (Geneva Declaration, 2008; UN-HABITAT, 2006; also J\u00fctersonke \net al., 2007: 165). \n 3\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \nforces. As a result, middle- and upper-income residents may feel the need to build \n(higher) walls and elaborate (more expansive) security systems to shield themselves, \ngiving rise to a Manichean landscape of \u2018safe\u2019 gated communities and \u2018violent\u2019 slums. \nReal and perceived violence mutually reinforce each other to create what Agbola (1997) \naptly describes as an \u201carchitecture of fear\u201d. The result is a fragmentation of public space, \na progressive breakdown of social cohesion through the generation of new forms of \nspatial segregation and social discrimination, and potentially more violence. Urban \nviolence can thus be understood as intricately linked to the structural dynamics of urban \nagglomeration, as well as to the competing interests of\u2014and power relations among\u2014\nsocial groups. The next sections attempt to detail such a panorama through the lens of \ngangs and the policy responses they have engendered. \n \nII. The Gangs of Central America \n \nOne of the most visible expressions of Central American violence is undoubtedly the gang. \nAlthough gangs as a social phenomenon have long featured in Central American societies, \ntheir growth and influence over the past two decades is unprecedented. In an effort to deal \nwith them, regional and domestic policy-makers have sought to link gangs with the \nspectacular rise in urban violence and disorder more generally.6 Accusations range from \nhomicide, muggings, theft, and intimidation, to rape, racketeering, extortion, kidnapping and \nthe narcotics trade. Likewise, international observers are increasingly linking gangs to \ninsurrection and internal conflict in so-called \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018fragile\u2019 state: in 2005, for example, \nthe US Army War College described the region\u2019s gangs as constituting a \u201cnew urban \ninsurgency\u201d with the goal \u201cto depose or control the governments of targeted countries\u201d \nthrough \u201ccoups d\u2019street\u201d (sic).7 These sentiments were echoed in more recent publications of \nthe US Department of Defence which called for the \u2018stabilization\u2019 of gang-inspired unrest \n(e.g. US, 2008).  \n \nAlthough gangs are unquestionably a major concern in Central America, a closer inspection \nof sensationalist claims reveals how they are profoundly misunderstood (cf. Huhn et al. \n2006a). Certainly, reliable information about Central American gangs is scarce and official \nrecord keeping is problematic owing to underreporting, deficient data collection, and political \ninterference (Huhn et al. 2006b: 8-13). Basic consensus on the size and scale of gang \nmembership is similarly lacking. While official figures speak of some 69,000 gang members \noperating throughout the region, estimates from private sources and academics indicate that \nthe number could be as high as 200,000 (UNODC 2007: 17, 60). Even the lower estimate \nimplies that there are more gang members than military personnel in Central America: \nNicaragua and Honduras register approximately 12,000 soldiers each, while El Salvador and \nGuatemala report 13,000 and 27,000 military personnel respectively (UNODC, 2007; Millett \nand Perez, 2005: 59).  \n \nWhile quantitative estimates are suspect, a number of qualitative studies reveals how gangs \nplay a central role in shaping the dynamics of urban violence across the region.8 Crucially, \n                                                 \n6 According to UNODC (2007: 64), the total proportion of contemporary violence in the region attributable to \ngangs varies widely from 10 to 60 per cent. \n7 See Manwaring (2005; 2006). A follow-up report by the same author published in 2008 further contended that \ngang violence constituted \u201canother kind of war (conflict) within the context of a \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019 \u2026being \nwaged \u2026around the world\u201d (Manwaring, 2008: 1). \n8 For an overview, see Huhn et al. (2006b); also Liebel (2004). The most comprehensive study is undoubtedly \nthe one reported on in the three volumes produced by a conglomerate of Central American research institutes \n 4\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \nthough, these qualitative studies also highlight the tremendous diversity between countries \nand cities in the region. Specifically, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are experiencing \nmuch greater levels of gang violence than Costa Rica and Nicaragua, although it should be \nnoted that violence in the latter is much more virulent than generally reported. Moreover, the \ndistribution of violence within all of these countries varies across time and space, it appears, \nhowever, that the overwhelming burden of gang violence occurs in urban areas, including in \nparticular capital cities.  \n \nGangs are very much urban manifestations, in large part because a critical demographic mass \nof youths is essential for them to emerge. Evidence suggests that up to 15 per cent of youths \nwithin gang-affected communities can end up joining\u2014although most studies indicate that on \naverage the figure is somewhere around three to five per cent. Gang sizes range from 15 to \n100 members with an average membership of 20 to 25 (ERIC et al. 2001; Rodgers, 2006a). \nMuch like urban violence as such, gangs are not evenly distributed within cities. They are \nmore likely to emerge in poorer areas, although the correlation between poverty and gang \nviolence is neither causal nor systematic. Indeed, a study in Guatemala city found that \nneighbourhoods falling within the metropolis\u2019 bottom income quartile suffered less gang-\nrelated crime than neighbourhoods falling within the second-to-last quartile (PNUD, 2007). \n \nThe vast majority of gang members are male.9 Nevertheless, there is evidence of female gang \nmembers and all-female gangs operating in Nicaragua and Guatemala (Rodgers, 2006a; \nWinton, 2007). The age range of gang members, however, is variable. For example, a 2001 \nsurvey of 1,000 gang members administered by the Instituto Universitario de Opini\u00f3n \nP\u00fablica (IUDOP) in El Salvador detected an average age of 20 and a mean entry age of 15. \nNicaraguan gang members appear to fall between the age of 7 and 23, while the age range of \nGuatemalan and Honduran gang members is between 12 and 30. In interrogating their \nmotives for joining the gang, the IUDOP assessment found that 40 per cent claimed to have \ndone so in order to \u201chang out\u201d, 21 per cent because they had gang member friends, and 21 per \ncent in order to evade family problems. The study also detected a partial correlation between \nyouth unemployment and gang membership: only 17 per cent of gang members were \nemployed, and 66 per cent actively characterised themselves as \u201cunemployed\u201d (Santacruz \nGiralt & Concha-Eastman, 2001). \n \nThere are considerable challenges in pinpointing specific factors that explain gang \nmobilisation and membership. Reified \u201cdeterminants\u201d and proximate factors such as family \nfragmentation, domestic abuse, or a psychological constitution do not appear to be \nconsistently significant. One factor that appears to systematically affect gang membership \nrelates to religious affiliation, insofar as evangelical Protestant youths in Nicaragua tend not \nto join gangs (Rodgers, 2006a).10 By way of contrast, gang mobilisation tends to be linked to \n                                                                                                                                                        \n(ERIC et al., 2001; 2004a; ERIC et al., 2004b). Three further overview studies have also been published \nrecently: USAID (2006), Demoscop\u00eda (2007), and the work of the \u201cPandillas juveniles transnacionales en \nCentroam\u00e9rica, M\u00e9xico y Estados Unidos\u201d project coordinated by the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de \nM\u00e9xico\u2019s (ITAM) Centro de Estudios y Programas Interamericanos (CEPI), available online at: \nhttp:\/\/interamericanos.itam.mx\/maras\/index.html. The country that has been studied in greatest depth is without \ndoubt Nicaragua (see Rocha, 2000a, 2000b, 2003, 2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c; Rocha and \nRodgers, 2008; Rodgers, 1997, 2000, 2006a, 2006b, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c). \n9 The fact that most gang members are young men, and that Central America suffers the highest male youth \nhomicide rates in the world (Pinheiro, 2006: 357), indirectly supports the notion that gangs are an important \nfactor within the regional panorama of violence. \n10 It can be speculated that this is perhaps because the totalising nature of evangelical Protestantism is such that \nchurches constitute a complete organisational framework for their members that is institutionally equivalent to \n 5\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \nbroad structural factors. These include, inter alia, pervasive machismo (many gang codes are \nclearly expressions of a heightened masculinity), high levels of social exclusion and \nhorizontal inequality, legacies of authoritarianism and armed conflict (and their aftermath),11 \nand the unregulated availability of weapons (it is estimated that there are over two million \nunregistered small arms in Central America).12 Likewise, gangs often make up for the \ncomparatively weak presence of the state and concomitant governance deficits (Rodgers, \n2006a; Koonings & Kruijt, eds., 1999; 2004). Another significant structural variable is \nmigration, including the deportation and return of convicts from North to Central America, \ndiscussed at more length below.  \n \nEven if there is frequently a tendency to talk about Central American gangs generically, a \ndistinction should be rendered between \u201cmaras\u201d and \u201cpandillas\u201d. Maras constitute a \nphenomenon with trans-national origins, while pandillas are more localised, home-grown \ngroups that are the direct inheritors of the youth gangs that have been a historic feature of \nCentral American societies. Pandillas were initially present throughout the region during the \npost-conflict period, but are now only significantly visible in Nicaragua\u2014and to a lesser \nextent in Costa Rica (where they are often called \u201cchapulines\u201d)\u2014having been almost \ncompletely supplanted by maras in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. \n \nAlthough differentiated according to shape and character, the contemporary Central \nAmerican-conflict pandilla phenomenon essentially originated as a local response to post-\nconflict volatility. After demobilised combatant youths returned to their home communities \nand had to contend with heightened socio-economic uncertainty and insecurity, they \ncoalesced as pandillas that were initially effectively vigilante-style neighbourhood self-\ndefence groups. From these relatively fluid and organic beginnings, they rapidly assumed \nspecific behaviour patterns that included engaging in semi-ritualised forms of gang warfare. \nThese clashes were themselves regulated by customary codes and expectations, including the \nprotection of local community inhabitants (Rodgers, 2006a). Post-conflict pandillas were thus \nmore numerous and violent than their predecessors, due in part to the military skills acquired \nduring the war. They were also more institutionalised than before, developing hierarchies and \nrules that persisted in spite of heavy membership turn-over.13\n \nThe maras, on the other hand, are linked to specific migratory patterns. There are reportedly \njust two mara groups, the Dieciocho (18) and the Salvatrucha (MS), operating in El Salvador, \nGuatemala, and Honduras. The maras emerged directly from the 18th Street gang in Los \nAngeles, a group initially founded by Mexican immigrants in the 1960s. The 18th Street gang \nexpanded during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of the influx of mainly Salvadoran \nand Guatemalan refugees who sought to incorporate into the gang as a form of social \ninclusion. By the latter half of the 1980s, a rival\u2014possibly splinter\u2014group founded by a \nsecond wave of Salvadoran refugees emerged, known as the \u201cMara Salvatrucha\u201d \n(\u201cSalvatrucha\u201d being a combination of \u201cSalvadore\u00f1o\u201d and \u201ctrucha\u201d, meaning \u201cquick-\n                                                                                                                                                        \nthat provided by the gang. Faith also appears to play a \u201cprotective\u201d function in the case of urban violence in Rio \nde Janeiro (Dreyfus et al., 2009).  \n11 Despite the introduction of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programmes in the wake of \nvarious peace agreements, large numbers of ex-soldiers and militia were only partially integrated back into \ncivilian life. See Muggah (2009; forthcoming).  \n12 See Godnick et al. (2002) for a description of arms collection activities throughout the region. \n13 \u201cMaturing out\u201d is a universal feature of youth gangs; as pandilleros in Nicaragua put it, \u201cthere are no old gang \nmembers\u201d (Rodgers, 2000). There is evidence to suggest that this is not quite as clear-cut in the case of maras, \nwhich are widely reported to have gang members of up to 30 years old, and from which it is said to be very \ndifficult to \u201cretire\u201d (see International Human Rights Clinic, 2007). \n 6\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \nthinking\u201d or \u201cshrewd\u201d in Salvadoran slang). The Dieciocho and the Salvatrucha rapidly \nbecame bitter rivals, and frequently fought each other on the streets of Los Angeles. As levels \nof intolerance began to grow and US immigration legislation acquired a more restrictive \ncharacter, US-based gang members were repatriated to Central America.14 Between 1998 and \n2005 the US deported almost 46,000 convicts to Central America, in addition to 160,000 \nillegal immigrants caught without the requisite permit. Three countries\u2014El Salvador, \nGuatemala, and Honduras\u2014received over 90 per cent of the deportations from the US \n(USAID, 2006: 18-19). \n \nThese deportee mareros rapidly reproduced the structures and behaviour patterns that had \nearlier provided them with support and security in the United States. They subsequently \nfounded local \u201cclikas\u201d, or chapters, of their gang in their communities of origin, which in turn \nrapidly began to attract local youths and either supplanted or absorbed local pandillas.15 \nContrarily to sensationalistic media claims, although each clika is explicitly affiliated with \neither the Mara Dieciocho or the Mara Salvatrucha, and while clikas from different \nneighbourhoods affiliated with the same mara will often join together to fight other groupings \nclaiming allegiance to the opposing mara, neither gang is a real federal structure, much less a \ntransnational one. Neither the Dieciocho nor the Salvatrucha gangs answer to a single chain \nof command, and their \u201cumbrella\u201d nature is more symbolic of a particular historical origin \nthan demonstrative of any real unity, be it of leadership or action. In many ways, the federated \nnature of the maras is more of an imagined social morphology than a real phenomenon, based \non the fact that the steady flows of deportees from the US share a common language and \nreference points.16\n \nThe extent and scale of urban violence attributed to pandillas and maras is likely to be \noverstated. In contrast to the numerous alarmist accounts linking Central American gangs to \nmigrant trafficking, kidnapping, and international organised crime, it is clear from qualitative \nstudies that both pandillas and maras are principally involved in small-scale, localised crime \nand delinquency such as petty theft and muggings.17 Such activities are typically carried out \non an inter-personal basis, although maras in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are also \nincreasingly involved collectively in the extortion of protection money from local businesses \n                                                 \n14 The two gangs were also heavily involved in the violence and looting that accompanied the 1992 Rodney King \nriots. The state of California soon implemented strict anti-gang laws, and prosecutors began to charge young \ngang members as adults instead of minors, sending hundreds to jail for felonies and other serious crimes. This \nwas followed in 1996 by the US Congress\u2019 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Non-\nUS citizens sentenced to a year or more in prison were now to be repatriated to their countries of origin, and \nforeign-born American felons could be stripped of their citizenship and expelled once they served their prison \nterms. \n15 According to Demoscop\u00eda (2007: 49), deportee gang members are becoming a minority as the rate of \ndeportation from the US declines, and adopting \u201cveteran\u201d functions, influencing mara behaviour through their \nprestige rather than actually taking part in gang activities. \n16 To this extent, although the maras can be conceived as loose networks of localised gangs, these do not \nnecessarily communicate or coordinate either within or between countries. Certainly, there is little evidence of \nany cooperation between maras in El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, and even less with the original putative \n\u201cmother gangs\u201d in Los Angeles. Rather, the ties that exist are more akin to a sense of identity, founded \norganically on individuals\u2019 common experience of gangsterism in the US, deportation, and stigmatisation in \nCentral America.  \n17 According to Ribando (2007: 1-2), \u201cgangs are generally considered to be distinct from organized criminal \norganizations because they typically lack the hierarchical leadership structure, capital, and manpower required to \nrun a sophisticated criminal enterprise. Gangs are generally more horizontally organized, with lots of small \nsubgroups and no central leadership setting strategy and enforcing discipline. Although some gangs are involved \nin the street-level distribution of drugs, few gangs or gang members are involved in higher-level criminal drug \ndistribution enterprises run by drug cartels, syndicates, or other sophisticated criminal organizations\u201d.  \n 7\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \nand the racketeering of buses and taxis as they transfer through the territories they control. It \nis also true that their resort to high-calibre firearms including AK-47s and fragmentation \ngrenades has increased the lethality of specific outcomes.18 Nonetheless, most pandilla and \nmara violence appears to be spatially circumscribed, isolated in large part to poorer peripheral \ncommunities from which the gangs emerge, and is also often inter-gang. \n \nWhile the scale and virulence of Central American gang violence may be less odious than \nwidely claimed, the type of urban violence committed by pandillas and maras is qualitatively \ntransforming. As mentioned above, Central America serves as a transit point for at least 80 \nper cent of all cocaine shipments between the Andean region and North America (UNODC, \n2007). There is an increasing amount of evidence suggesting that the involvement of local \ngang members in drug trafficking and dealing is leading to both types of gangs evolving \ntowards more violent behaviour patterns (Aguilar, 2006; International Human Rights Clinic, \n2007; Rodgers, 2006a; 2007b; Rocha, 2007a). Trafficking itself appears to be decentralised, \nwith shipments passing from Colombia to Mexico between smaller localised Central \nAmerican cartels, each extracting a cut. Maras and pandillas tend to serve as a local security \napparatus for the smaller cartels, or as informally connected street vendors. Gangs are seldom \ninvolved in the large-scale or trans-national movement of narcotics, nor do they wholesale, \nalthough certain studies suggest that the leaders of these small, local cartels are often ex-gang \nmembers who have \u201cgraduated\u201d (Rodgers, 2006a; 2007a). \n \nGang violence is ultimately embedded in a wider crisis of exclusion and spatial segregation. It \ncannot be conceived narrowly as a function of rational choice or endogenous factors isolated \nto gang-affected communities. Owing to the scarcity of alternative (legal\/legitimate) \neconomic opportunities, some commentators describe survival in Central America, including \nfor gang members, as \u201cruthless Darwinian competition\u201d with tensions emerging over \u201cthe \nsame informal scraps, ensur[ing] self-consuming communal violence as yet the highest form \nof urban involution\u201d (Davis, 2004: 28; see also Rodgers, forthcoming a). Such processes are \nreinforced by new patterns of segregation and exclusion in the region\u2019s cities as a result of \nliberal market-led urban renewal and design. These tend to lead to the proliferation of gated \ncommunities and closed condominiums, as well as the fortification of urban transport \nnetworks (Rodgers, 2004; 2008). Also affected are forms of municipal governance, \nexemplified by the intensive patrolling of a city\u2019s wealthier neighbourhoods and transport \nhubs coupled with unpredictable, arbitrary, and often violent entrances of security forces in \nslums and poorer areas.19 These latter interventions precipitate localised conditions of terror \nand symbolically demonstrate the power of an elite-captured state (Rodgers, 2006b). The \nmost visible facet of this new approach is the launching of a \u201cwar on gangs\u201d by Central \nAmerican governments over the past five years, the subject of the next section.  \n \nIII. Mano Dura: A war against gangs \n \nThe opening salvo of the veritable \u201cwar on gangs\u201d underway in Central America was El \nSalvador\u2019s adoption of a \u201cMano Dura\u201d (\u201cIron Fist\u201d) policy in July 2003. A harbinger of \nrepressive approaches to gang control, the Mano Dura approach advocated the immediate \nimprisonment (for up to five years) of youths as young as 12 who displayed gang-related \n                                                 \n18 The 2001 IUDOP survey of Salvadoran gang members mentioned above, for example, found that 25 per cent \nof those questioned admitted to having committed a murder in the past year, while a further 25 per cent refused \nto answer the question. See Santacruz Giralt & Concha-Eastman (2001). \n19 This spatial segregation mirrors, in many ways, the favela slums of Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro (see Dreyfus \net al., 2009).  \n 8\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \ntattoos or flashed gang signs in public. Between July 2003 and August 2004, roughly 20,000 \nmareros were arrested, although approximately 95 per cent of them were eventually released \nwithout charge after the Mano Dura law was declared unconstitutional by the Salvadoran \nSupreme Court for violating the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child \n(UNCRC) (Hume, 2007). A new \u201cMano Super Dura\u201d package of anti-gang reforms was \nsubsequently advanced, which respected the provisions of the UNCRC but stiffened the \npenalties for gang membership by lengthening prison sentences. Although under the new law \nthe police required proof of active delinquent behaviour in order to arrest an individual, El \nSalvador\u2019s prison population doubled in just five years, from 6,000 to 12,000 prisoners, 40 \nper cent of whom are allegedly gang members (Hume, 2007). \n \nOther Central American states soon followed El Salvador\u2019s lead. Honduran authorities \nimplemented an analogous approach \u2014\u201cCero Tolerancia\u201d (\u201cZero Tolerance\u201d)\u2014in August \n2003. Inspired in part by former New York mayor Giuliani\u2019s eponymous policy, it featured a \nreformed penal code and legislation that established a maximum 12-year prison sentence for \ngang membership. Eventually, however, the penalty was stiffened to 30 years, and provisions \nwere made to securitise the response to gangs through intensified collaboration between the \nnational police and the army during urban patrols. Meanwhile, Guatemala\u2019s authorities \nadopted \u201cPlan Escoba\u201d (\u201cOperation Broomsweep\u201d) in January 2004, which although not as \ndraconian as Mano Dura or Cero Tolerancia nevertheless featured provisions allowing \nminors to be treated as adults and the deployment of 4,000 reserve army troops in troubled \nneighbourhoods in the capital. For its part, Nicaragua regularly implemented a range of anti-\ngang initiatives from 1999 onwards, although these were of a considerably \u201csofter\u201d nature.20 \nWhile these crackdowns were very popular amongst the general public in all Central \nAmerican countries, they were also vigorously opposed by human rights groups. More \nominously, entities such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International presented \nevidence\u2014corroborated by the US State Department in 2005\u2014of the existence of \nparamilitary death squads in Honduras and El Salvador that are deliberately targeting gang \nmembers, and often youths more generally, moreover in collusion with state authorities (see \nFaux, 2006). \n \nCentral American states have also initiated unprecedented forms of cross-border cooperation \nin order to deal with assumed transnational linkages amongst gangs. In September 2003, a \nregional summit of heads of state declared that gangs were \u201ca destabilising menace, more \nimmediate than any conventional war or guerrilla\u201d (cf. Rodgers, forthcoming a). By early \n2004, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua agreed to lift legal barriers to the \ncross-country prosecution of gang members, whatever their nationality. By mid-2005, the \nPresidents of El Salvador and Guatemala decided to establish a joint security force to patrol \ngang activity along their common border. The Central American states also sought to involve \nthe United States which, though initially reluctant to adopt an assertive role, soon assumed a \nmore muscular and aggressive approach following the proliferation of unfounded allegations \nconnecting gangs to \u201cterrorist groups\u201d such as Al Qaeda and the Revolutionary Armed Forces \nof Colombia (FARC) in 2004 and 2005.21 The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has \n                                                 \n20 Although Nicaragua has gained a reputation for focusing on \u201cpreventative\u201d rather than \u201crepressive\u201d anti-gang \npolicies, empirical evidence of its practices tends to belie this (see Rocha, 2007c), even if overall the police \nresponse to gangs has not been as violent as in other Central American countries, partly because of the less \nviolent nature of the pandillas compared to the maras. \n21 In early 2004, for example, the Honduran minister of Security, Oscar Alvarez, rather ludicrously claimed that \na suspected Saudi member of Al Qaeda, Yafar Al-Taya was harbouring connections with gang leaders. In April \n2005, he followed this up with a new (and no less ludicrous) claim to have thwarted a Colombian FARC-mara \nplot to kill President Ricardo Maduro. \n 9\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \ncreated a special task force focusing on Central American gangs, and has announced the \ncreation of a liaison office in San Salvador to coordinate regional information-sharing and \nanti-gang efforts.  \n \nInevitably, hard-handed measures are frequently supported by the public owing to the \nvisibility such interventions afford.22 But while official reports claim that anti-gang initiatives \ngenerate significant reductions in criminal violence, most evidence indicates that these effects \nare temporary and tenuous. Crack-down operations against gangs tend to generate perverse \neffects\u2014including a greater predisposition to excessive acts of brutality and new forms of \nadaptation to avoid capture. Indeed, repressive tactics frequently encourage members to \nbecome more organised and violent,23 as is well illustrated by escalatory violence in \nHonduras in the wake of Mano Dura.24 Similarly processes have been reported in El Salvador \nand Guatemala.  \n \nAt the same time, the \u201cwar on gangs\u201d has reportedly encouraged a number of maras to adapt \nand alter their behaviour in favour of less violent ways, and indeed, an increasing number of \nstudies suggest that gangs are attempting to become less conspicuous. For example, gang \nmembers in El Salvador now tend to deploy less obvious signs and symbols, abandoning their \ntattoos and short-cropped hairstyles to avoid detection. Others are more mobile: the \nemigration of maras into Southern Mexico is widely attributed to repressive policies in \nCentral America (Aguilar & Miranda, 2006: 49). More generally, gangs are widely reported \nas being less involved in crimes such as homicides. El Salvador\u2019s reported homicide rate of \n41 deaths per 100,000 people in 2004 for example rose to almost 60 by 2007, while the \nproportion of these homicides deemed to be related to gangs simultaneously declined, for \nexample (Reisman, 2008). While such changes are interpreted by some analysts as evidence \nthat gangs are \u201closing\u201d ground to the authorities, there are indications that this may not be the \ncase. \n \nThe transformation of Nicaraguan pandillas between the 1990s and the 2000s is a case in \npoint. These gangs shifted from efforts to create localised forms of social order and belonging \nto becoming organisations promoting parochial forms of drug dealing instead. Rather than \nprotecting local neighbourhood inhabitants, gangs acted to ensure the proper functioning of \nlocal drug economies in line with the interests of their members and associated local \ndealers\u2014more often than not ex-gang members\u2014through the imposition of localised regimes \nof terror based on fear, threats, and widespread acts of arbitrary violence (see Rodgers, 2006a; \n2007a; 2007b). By 2007, however, pandillas seemed to be disappearing, as most gang \nmembers were \u201cretiring\u201d and not being replaced by a new generation, with a small minority \njoining more professional and de-territorialised criminal organisations associated with \n                                                 \n22 See, for example, Forter (2004), who surveyed perceptions of violence and victimisation among citizens in El \nSalvador, Honduras and Guatemala.  \n23 Aguilar & Miranda (2006: 42). The Central American Coalition for the Prevention of Youth Violence \n(CCPVJ) has shown that Mano Dura policies can be linked to a dramatic surge in youth violence\u2014up to 40 per \ncent in the first three years of implementation\u2014in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (Guti\u00e9rrez, 2006). \n24 On 30 August 2003, one month after the promulgation of the new anti-gang legislation, gang members \nattacked a bus in the Northern city of San Pedro Sula in broad daylight, killing 14, and leaving 18 wounded, as \nwell as a note to President Ricardo Maduro ordering him to withdraw the law. The following month, in the town \nof Puerto Cortes, a young woman\u2019s head was found in a plastic bag with a note addressed to President Maduro \nsaying that this was a response to the extrajudicial assassination of a gang member by the police. Over the course \nof the following year, more than 10 decapitated corpses were left in various cities with messages from gang \nmembers to the Honduras president, each time in response to a putative extrajudicial killing, and on 23 \nDecember 2004, in Chamalecon, gang members again attacked a bus and killed 28, once again leaving a \nmessage claiming revenge for the May 2004 death of 105 gang members in a prison following a suspect fire. \n 10\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \nnarcotics trafficking. This professionalisation is ominous, insofar as the corrosive role that \norganised crime can play in developing contexts is extremely well-known (cf. Glenny, 2008). \n \nIV. Mano Extendida: A new paradigm? \n \nThere appears to be a subtle shift from what we describe as \u201cfirst\u201d to \u201csecond generation\u201d \npolicies of containing urban gang violence in Central America. As the previous section \nshowed, first generation initiatives such as Mano Dura can be characterised as security-, or \nenforcement-, first. They combine aggressive, militarised crack-down operations with \nincreased penalties to deter gang membership. Interventions are executed by the state security \napparatus and are combined with frequently draconian reforms to the judicial and penal \nprocess. Rehabilitative and developmental programmes are weakly supported, if at all. \nParadoxically, first generation policies tend to contribute to and exacerbate the routine \nstigmatisation of gang members, thus preventing their reform and ultimately meaningful \nreintegration into society. Owing in large part to mounting criticism and evidence of these \nperverse effects, Mano Dura programmes are in some cases giving way to\u2014but not replaced \nby\u2014Mano Amiga (\u201cfriendly hand\u201d) and Mano Extendida (\u201cextended hand\u201d) interventions. In \ntheory, these second generation interventions focus not just on symptoms, but also risks of \ngang violence. They are typically \u2018voluntary\u2019 and place a greater emphasis on generating \ncompliance through a combination of incentives.25  \n \n \nFigure 1: Second Generation Armed Violence Reduction \n \n \nAs the figure above shows, second generation activities come in a range of shapes and sizes. \nSuch interventions feature host of activities ranging from voluntary weapons collection, \ntemporary firearms carrying restrictions, and alcohol prohibitions, to environmental design in \nslums and targeted education and public health initiatives focusing on \u201cat-risk youth\u201d and \neven single female-headed care-giving households. Examples in Central America include \nAPREDE (Alianza para la Prevenci\u00f3n del Delito) in Guatemala, which stresses community \napproaches to reinserting gang members, JHAJA (J\u00f3venes Hondure\u00f1os Adelante, Juntos \nAvancemos), offering employment opportunities in the formal and informal sectors for ex-\ngang members, and Homies Unidos, a collective of ex-gang members in El Salvador working \nwith youth and gang members to highlight alternatives to violence, but also to transfer \nmarketable skills.  \n \nWhile varying in intent and design, second generation efforts feature an evidence-led and \n\u201cintegrated\u201d approach to urban violence prevention and reduction. Because action plans tend \nto be formulated by municipal authorities and service-providers in concert with public and \nprivate security actors, academic institutions, and civil society, they can also unconsciously \nadopt a more participatory and inter-sectoral approach. These interventions purposefully seek \nto build-up confidence and legitimacy from below through the deliberate engagement of local \nactors. They are dependent, however, in large part on comparatively robust and credible local \npublic authorities and civil society engagement\u2014institutions that may nevertheless be \nweakened by prolonged episodes of chronic violence (Muggah, forthcoming).  \n \n                                                 \n25 See, for example, Colletta & Muggah (forthcoming) for a review of second generation security promotion, \nincluding gang violence reduction programmes.  \n 11\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \nBuilding interventions on the basis of a grounded appreciation of local context is a key \ninnovation of these second generation interventions. For example, community-driven \ndemobilisation and reintegration activities targeting erstwhile gang members, community, and \ntargeted weapons collection initiatives all emphasise the importance of building on local \nvalues and norms associated with the reproduction of gangs and gang violence. At best, they \naim to reinforce coordinated public and private sector responses and to provide mentorship, \nrisk education, and alternative livelihoods for would-be perpetrators and victims, especially \nboys and young men, in poor and marginal communities (WOLA, 2008).26 But where \npartnerships with the public are developed in deliberative or factional ways, the marginalised \nmay be excluded, and partnerships themselves may fall under the sway of more powerful \nlocal groups and political associations that seek to influence these institutions (Muggah and \nJ\u00fctersonke, forthcoming). \n \nV. From rhetoric to outcomes: Assessing the effectiveness of second \ngeneration interventions \n \nWhile neatly packaged in theory, second generation interventions have yet to prove \nthemselves in practice. We outline a threefold approach to determining their effectiveness. \nThe first element is discursive and considers how second generation approaches feature (or \nnot) in normative declarations, such as legislation, decrees, policies, and public statements. \nAssessing discursive effects entails an interpretive approach in order to determine how these \ninitiatives are distinguishable from prior activities and the way in which they delimit a \n\u201cdiscursive field in which specific policy initiatives can be pursued in a coherent way\u201d \n(Muggah and Krause, 2006: 131). A second benchmark to measure effectiveness is \npractical\u2014whether there is evidence of qualitatively new initiatives, new modes of acting and \nbehaving, and new actors and coalitions. In other words, are rhetorical commitments being \nconverted into deeds? The third and arguably most important criterion relates to the outcomes \nof second generation activities\u2014are they contributing to meaningful improvements in safety \nand security such as reductions in homicidal violence and visible decreases in gang \nmembership? While such information is of course difficult to assemble, it is nevertheless \ncrucial to (measuring) the \u201csuccess\u201d of the second generation enterprise itself.  \n \nWhen considering discursive shifts, it remains unclear the extent to which second generation \ninitiatives truly comprise a transformation in Central American policy culture. In a uniquely \ndetailed study mapping out the incentives governing the institutional and organisational \nframework regarding youth violence reduction in Nicaragua, for example, Rocha (2007c) \njudged the government\u2019s discursive promotion of second generation policies to be principally \naimed at appeasing potential foreign donors and securing international funds. In practice, \nhowever, government action remained ostensibly \u201cfirst generation\u201d in nature, even if not as \nviolent as its Northern Central American counterparts, where similar dynamics are evident. \nNevertheless, second generation initiatives are clearly being heavily promoted by multilateral \nand bilateral development agencies working in the region, and are part of a new conceptual \nconsensus within policy circles that cannot be ignored (Muggah and Stevenson, forthcoming). \nIt could be the case that the much anticipated rhetorical turn has yet to fully take hold.,  \n \n                                                 \n26 Other gang-violence reduction programmes that appear to have contributed to sharp reductions in armed \nviolence in the US include \u2018Identity\u2019 (Montgomery County, Maryland), Community Mobilization Initiative \n(Herndon, Virginia) and Gang Intervention Partnership (Columbia Heights, Washington DC). Examples of \nCentral American activities include Group Ceiba (Guatemala), Paz y Justicia (Honduras) and Equipo Nahual (El \nSalavador). \n 12\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \nAt the level of practice, even where levels of financial investment in first generation \ninitiatives far surpass those being accorded to second generation programmes (Hartnett, 2008: \n5), examples of the latter are clearly being implemented in the region, particularly by \nmultilateral and bilateral development agencies. Under the rubric of \u201ccitizen security\u201d and \n\u201cviolence reduction\u201d, the World Bank, IADB27, World Health Organisation (WHO), 28 the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Habitat Programme \n(UNHABITAT), the UN Office for Drug and Crime Control (UNODC) and others are \ninvested in an array of activities designed to promote greater compliance and a focus on \nvoluntary approaches to addressing urban violence and gangs. For example, the World Bank \ndeveloped a Small Grants Programme for Violence Prevention (SGPVP) in 2005 as part of a \nwider crime and violence prevention initiative, which included a focus on gangs. In keeping \nwith the second generation framework outlined above, the agency seeks to support \n\u201ccommunity-based\u201d and municipally-driven approaches to reducing weapons availability and \nre-engineering the attitudes and behaviour of gangs who might use them. In 2006, eleven out \nof 100 project grants were received in Honduras and Nicaragua to prevent gang violence and \nempower vulnerable urban communities.29 Table one schematically reviews a sample of first \nand second generation initiatives that have been implemented in Central America during the \npast decade. \n \nTable 1: From first to second generation violence prevention in Central America \n \nIt is perhaps at this level of \u2018practice\u2019 that second generation activities are most visible. \nOwing to the trans-national dynamics of gang violence, a number of regional second \ngeneration activities are fast emerging. Examples of this include the SICA (Sistema de la \nIntegraci\u00f3n Centroamericana\u2014Central American Integration System) and UNDP-led armed \nviolence prevention activities. Similarly, the REDCEPAZ (Red Centroamericana para la \nConstrucci\u00f3n de la Paz y la Seguridad Humana\u2014Central American network for the \nConstruction of Peace and Human Security)  consists of a constellation of non-governmental \norganisations active throughout Central America. The networks undertakes a wide variety of \nactivities that might reduce weapons supplies (through amnesties and voluntary collection), \npromote activities for at-risk youth (peer-to-peer mentoring and reintegration programmes), \nand advocate enhanced national and sub-regional policies associated with violence reduction \n(by enhancing legislation in line with international sandards).30 Likewise, in Central America, \nan Inter-American Coalition for the Prevention of Violence (IACPV) was launched in 2000. \nComprised of a collection of internationally- and regionally-focused organisations, it \nadvocates for strategies intended to confront criminal violence with non-coercive strategies in \nthe Americas (IACPV, 2008).  \n                                                 \n27 The IADB has supported large-scale citizen security and crime prevention interventions in Latin America and \nthe Caribbean since the late 1990s and developed considerable expertise in this regard. \n28 The TEACH-VIP curriculum, developed by WHO and a network of injury prevention experts in 2004 (WHO, \n2008), and TEACH-VIP Youth developed by PAHO and the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) (cf. Muggah \nand Stevenson, forthcoming), serve as key training components for medical professionals, students and partners \nin El Salvador in terms of violence prevention and care. \n29 Among the projects selected by the World Bank are: A Smile without Violence (Honduras); Strengthening of \nProductive Businesses Belonging to Former Gang Members (Honduras); Promoting Peaceful Living and \nConflict Negotiation in Schools with the Participation of Girls, Boys and Adolescents (Nicaragua); and Looking \nfor a Change: Violence Prevention Contribution in Five Municipalities of Chinandega (Nicaragua). See World \nBank (2008b). \n30 Key members of this network include the Arias Foundation (Costa Rica), FESPAD (El Salvador), CIPRODEH \n(Honduras), IEEPP and CEI (Nicaragua), IEPADES (Guatemala), and SERPAJ (Panama). This group of \norganisations share tasks, funding, and priorities, as well as national and technical expertise relating to \npublications, information exchange, meetings, and other forms of collaboration. \n 13\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \n \nWhen it comes to outcomes, however, there is comparatively meagre evidence of effective \nimpacts across time and space. Indeed, in the Central American countries that now long ago \nemerged from war, including Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, homicidal violence \nappears to be rising or remaining stable\u2013\u2013sometimes equivalent to peak periods of armed \nconflict.31 For example, El Salvador\u2019s national homicide rate was 45.5 per 100,000 in 1995. \nBy 2005, the rate had actually risen to 48.8 per 100,000. More alarming, the homicide rate \namong El Salvador\u2019s youth population rose from 74.7 per 100,000 to 92.3 per 100,000 over \nthe same period (Waiselfisz, 2008). Likewise, in Guatemala, the national homicide rate \nincreased from 20.9 per 100,000 (1995) to 28.5 per 100,000 (2005) and from 29.2 per \n100,000 to an astonishing 55.4 per 100,000 for youths. By comparison, national and youth \n(homidide) rates have fallen dramatically in Mexico and Colombia.32 While a more effective \nspatial unit of analysis to measure the outcomes of second generation activities would be the \ncity and in particular the poorer, slum areas, such data is seldom available.  \n \nIndeed, in spite of an avowed commitment to evidence-based approaches, most second \ngeneration activities have so far failed to develop comprehensive and robust monitoring and \nevaluation mechanisms. Indicators are also frequently poorly developed, documented, and \nanalysed. Generally, there is little empirical evidence that second generation approaches are \nactually achieving major change beyond the rhetorical (Barnes, 2007). And while absence of \nevidence is not necessarily evidence of absence, there are few empirical assessments \nmeasuring clear correlates between second generation interventions and corollary reductions \nin homicidal violence or real and perceived victimisation. To the contrary, just as there is a \nsense among critics that first generation interventions appear to radicalise gangs rather than \ndestroy them, there is some concern that second generation interventions tend to be all smoke \nand no fire.  \n \nConclusion \n \nGangs constitute a real but much misunderstood feature of the Central American panorama of \nurban violence. While there is little doubt that they are involved in significant levels of \nviolence, gangs are highly heterogeneous and connected more to localised insecurity rather \nthan the transnational menace ascribed to them by the media and certain policy-makers. \nAlthough they are fundamentally connected to certain deep-seated issues such as the long \nlegacy of war, machismo, and the availability of small arms in the region, they are also the \nconsequence of increasing (regional and national) inequality and exclusion, and as such a \nreflection of deeply iniquitous social processes. A growing cadre of researchers are \nhighlighting broad social and economic phenomena such as exclusion, marginalisation, rapid \nsocial change, and lack of opportunities as the central determinants shaping the contemporary \nemergence of gangs in Central America. \n \nCentral America\u2019s heavy-fisted attempts to arrest its gang trouble is not working. Instead, the \nrepressive approach adopted by most governments in the region appears to have exacerbated \nthe problem, precipitating a tit-for-tat spiral of violence and radicalising actual and would-be \n                                                 \n31 Since the end of civil war in all three countries there has been an explosion of criminal violence\u2014especially in \nurban areas. Although under-reporting and under-recording is significant, in Nicaragua, for example, the \nabsolute number of crimes tripled between 1990 and 2003. Crime perception surveys confirm rising fear \namongst the population at large. See Rodgers (2004).  \n32 Waiselfisz (2008) observes that national homicide rates in 1995 were 64 and 17.3 per 100,000 for Colombia \nand Mexico respectively. By 2005, the rates had declined to 43.8 and 9.3 per 100,000.  \n 14\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \ngang members. Seen more broadly, these actions reflect a progressive securitisation of social \nspace anticipated by Agamben (2005). They also forecast the exceptionalism of security-first \nresponses to problems of under-development and the way they expand opportunities for a \n(liberal) minority at the expense of the majority (Duffield, 2008). Repression cannot remedy \nthe underlying societal contradictions that generated the gangs in the first place, and are \ninstead contributing to the escalation of more organised\u2014and in some cases, flagrantly \nviolent\u2014crime. Much has been said and written about a newly emerging \u201csecond generation\u201d \nof policy responses to gangs. Adopting a multi-pronged approach to measuring effectiveness, \nthis article has demonstrated that such initiatives\u2014far from serving as a panacea\u2014have in \nfact yielded mixed results. While there is piece meal evidence of certain discursive and \npractical gains, the outcomes of second generation efforts to reduce urban gang violence are \nstill far from clear.  \n \nThere is a recurring challenge facing those who seek to support gang violence reduction \ninitiatives. This is that the design and implementation of social policy within any given set of \ncircumstances will inevitably mirror the political dispensations and economic dynamics of the \ncontext in question. As such, arguably the single biggest obstacle to developing a coherent \napproach to urban gang violence in Central America is the deeply entrenched oligarchic \nnature of the societies in the region. This takes strategic intervention beyond the relatively \nstraight-forward dilemmas associated with policy paralysis, particularly given that Central \nAmerican governments can be seen as very much undertaking their visible and widely-\npublicised crackdowns on gangs in order to avoid taking action on much more tricky issues \nrelated to exclusion, inequality, and the lack of job creation. Put another way, it seems that \ngangs have become convenient scapegoats on which to blame the isthmus\u2019 problems and \nthrough which those in power attempt to maintain an unequal status quo. At the same time, \nhowever, they also simultaneously embody the risks of violent social action that will \ninevitably erupt in the face of attempts to preserve an unjust society. \n \n \n 15\nREVISED VERSION \u2013 February 2009 \nReferences \n \nAgamben, Giorgio, 2005.
