A detailed \napproach highlights fully the process of applying boundary conditions, including the \ntreatment of examples in which the assumptions made in previous work are no longer \nvalid. Verification of the method is undertaken by means of estimating stress intensity \nfactors and comparing them against analytical solutions. The coupled algorithm \nshows good convergence properties. Issues relating to traction scaling, the use of \ndiscontinuous boundary elements, and the greater versatility of the coupled method \nover its constituent methods are highlighted. \n \nKeywords: boundary element method; scaled boundary finite element method; \nfracture; linear elasticity; coupled methods \n2 Introduction \nThe estimation of stress intensity factors (SIFs) is of fundamental importance in \ndamage tolerance assessment and the prediction of crack propagation in engineering \nmaterials. Methods existing to calculate analytically the SIFs are limited to simple \ngeometries. As a result, numerous numerical methods have been developed, each with \ndistinct and overlapping advantages and disadvantages, including the finite element \nmethod (FEM), the boundary element method (BEM), the scaled boundary finite \nelement method (SBFEM) [1], the dual boundary element method (DBEM) [2] and \nthe eXtended finite element method (XFEM) [3]. \n \nFor example, the FEM is known for its ease of implementation; the BEM, DBEM and \nSBFEM share common advantages of reducing the spatial discretisation dimension by \none; and XFEM overcomes many of the remeshing requirements of a more traditional \nFEM-based crack propagation algorithm. However, their drawbacks include the needs \nof both the FEM and BEM for a heavily refined mesh in the region of a crack tip, the \ncomputation of hypersingular integrals in the DBEM, and the accurate maintenance of \na numerical definition of a propagating crack path in XFEM. In efforts to combine \ntheir respective advantages, many coupled methods have been published. \n \nThe coupled BE-SBFEM combines the geometric flexibility of the BEM to model \nsections of a domain that may not be simple in nature, with the accuracy of the \nSBFEM to model the region around a crack tip. \n \n 2 \nThe historical development of the BEM is well-known and is not covered here. The \nSBFEM is less well-known and its inclusion in coupled methods is summarised here. \nThe SBFEM was predated by the infinitesimal finite-element cell method of Wolf and \nSong [4] and later the consistent infinitesimal finite-element cell method [5, 6], \nalthough all are evolutions of the same method. However, the mathematics behind the \noriginal \u2018mechanically-based\u2019 derivation of the SBFEM in the publications of Song \nand Wolf, may have contributed to its slow uptake by other engineering researchers. \n \nIn an effort to raise its awareness and demonstrate its versatility as a tool for \ncomputing the dynamic stiffness of an unbounded domain, Song and Wolf re-derived \nthe SBFEM by means of a weighted residual approach, as a displacement formulation \nin the frequency domain for general problems in elastodynamics in three dimensions \n[7]. The inclusion of body loads was then addressed and derivations summarised for \nthe SBFEM in two and three dimensions for bounded and unbounded domains [8]. \nTwo \u2018primer papers\u2019 were published to illustrate the SBFEM derived in these two \nmanners along with a worked example [9, 10]. \n \nA third (virtual work-based) derivation was presented in Deeks and Wolf [1] \nalongside a comparable virtual work-based FEM derivation, highlighting their \nsimilarities and increasing the accessibility to researchers with a background in solid \nmechanics. Side face loads and axisymmetric modelling were also addressed and the \nuse of domain substructuring and multiple scaling centres was introduced. Deeks and \nWolf then developed a stress recovery technique and a Zienkiewicz-Zhu-based error \nestimator that provided a direct comparison with the FEM for the first time [11]. The \nSBFEM was compared favourably with the FEM in applications involving \nsingularities, discontinuities or unbounded domains. This stress recovery technique \nand error estimator was used in conjunction with an h-hierarchical procedure to \ndevelop a simple h-adaptive mesh refinement strategy [12]. Vu and Deeks later \ndeveloped a p-adaptive refinement procedure and showed that higher order shape \nfunctions in this adaptive technique offered improved convergence over h-adaptive \nmethods [13, 14]. Deeks developed a method of prescribing Dirichlet boundary \nconditions (displacement constraints) along side faces [15] and also demonstrated that \nthe use of linear elements can give higher-order results on the undiscretised side faces. \n \nUnlike conventional numerical approaches that, with few exceptions, use a piecewise \npolynomial basis in which to seek a solution, the SBFEM uses an analytical \nassumption in the radial direction from its origin. By defining the origin, or scaling \ncentre, at a crack tip, the SBFEM has been found effective in the accurate estimation \nof SIFs. Chidgzey and Deeks [16] showed how the SBFEM can form a truncated \nseries expansion around a scaling centre placed at a crack tip that closely resembles \nthe Williams expansion [17] for determining stress intensity factors in linear elastic \nfracture mechanics. This allowed for a direct extraction of Williams expansion \ncoefficients from the SBFEM solution. Yang developed an algorithm for automatic \nmodelling of crack propagation through a SBFEM domain [18], and a procedure for \nfully automated modelling of mixed-mode crack propagation [19]. By introducing a \nmethod of substructuring around the crack tip, remeshing complications often \nassociated with crack propagation in other numerical methods were reduced. This \nprocedure was also applied in coupling SBFEM subdomains in the proximity of the \ncrack tip with the FEM in the far field region [20]. Deeks and Augarde also \ndemonstrated the coupling of the SBFEM to a meshless method [21]. \n 3 \n \nAn approach similar to Yang [19] is presented here, but with additional motivation. \nThe SBFEM is used to model the singular behaviour of the stress fields around the \ncrack tip by means of a relatively small SBFEM subdomain in the proximity of the \ncrack tip. The far field may contain geometric features for which the SBFEM may not \nbe suited to model, so it is modelled by a relatively large subdomain using the more \ngeometrically flexible BEM. This approach was first demonstrated by Chidgzey et al. \n[22], although results were limited to empirical comparisons. Assumptions were made \nthat limit the application of their scheme to certain sets of boundary conditions. This \nrestriction has been removed in the current paper, and results are compared against \nanalytical solutions. An example of modelling a non-trivial domain is also included in \nthis paper to demonstrate the method\u2019s suitability for industrial engineering problems. \n \nThough not presented here, this method forms the basis of work to include the use of \nDBEM for an efficient BEM mesh and reanalysis [23, 24], where the reuse of data \ncommon to multiple analyses lends itself to an efficient BEM-based method of crack \npropagation prediction. In this approach, the computational efficiency may be \nenhanced by the reuse of the entire SBFEM matrix if this region is simply translated \nspatially from one crack growth increment to the next. \n3 Numerical formulation of the method \n3.1 SBFEM overview \nFor details of the formulation of the SBFEM the reader is directed to [1]. The key \npoints are summarised here. The scaled boundary coordinate system is given by a \ngeometrically-specific coordinate s  acting in the circumferential direction running \nparallel to the boundary, scaled about a geometric scaling centre \u02c6 \u02c6( , )x y , by a radial \ncoordinate \uf078  defined by 0\uf078 \uf03d  at \u02c6 \u02c6( , )x y , that passes through the boundary at 1\uf078 \uf03d , as \nshown in Figure 1(a). The model is discretised in s , but remains analytical in \uf078  such \nthat displacement of node k  in direction ,i x y\uf03d  is defined by the semi-analytical \nfunction ( , )iku s\uf078 . As the \uf078 - and s-directions are orthogonal, should the scaling centre \nbe placed on the boundary, there will be two sections of boundary over which s  \nremains constant in the \uf078 -direction. In such cases, s  will become an open axis. The \nremaining sections of scaled boundary are modelled by side faces LA  and RA , and \ndo not form part of the discretised boundary, as shown in Figure 1(b). Side faces are a \nuseful property of the SBFEM [16] as they allow the undiscretised analysis of \nsections of boundary, unlike comparable methods such as the FEM.  \n 4 \nscaling centre\nx y\u02c6 \u02c6( , )\n0 25\nS\n\uf078 \uf03d .0 50\nS\n\uf078 \uf03d .0 75\nS\n\uf078 \uf03d .1 00\nS\n\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 25\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 50\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 75\uf078 \uf03d .\n1 00\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 25\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 50\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 75\uf078 \uf03d .\n1 00\uf078 \uf03d .\nscaling centre\nx y\u02c6 \u02c6( , )\n0 75\nS\n\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 50\nS\n\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 25\nS\n\uf078 \uf03d .\n1 00\nS\n\uf078 \uf03d .\n\uf078 \uf03d \uf0a5\nsi\nd\ne \nfa\nce\n \nside face \nL\nA\nR\nA(a) (b)\n0 25\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 50\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 75\uf078 \uf03d .\n1 00\uf078 \uf03d .\n1 00\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 75\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 50\uf078 \uf03d .\n0 25\uf078 \uf03d .\n \nFigure 1. A bounded domain (shaded) modelled using the SBFEM (a) with an internal scaling \ncentre and (b) with the introduction of side faces due to the scaling centre on the boundary \nIn 2D, the displacement of any point within the domain \uf057  is considered a linear \ncombination of 2n  displacement mode shapes, where n  is the number of nodes in the \nmodel that contribute to its 2n  degrees of freedom. For each SBFEM model, there is \na total of 4n  mode shapes, since the SBFEM can be used to model both bounded and \nunbounded (infinite) domains, each requiring a different set of 2n  mode shapes. \n \nThe 4n  mode shapes are described by a modal displacement matrix \u03a6  and a modal \nforce matrix Q , from which subsets d\u03a6  and dQ , each containing information \nrelating to the 2n  mode shapes, are selected according to whether the domain is \nbounded or unbounded. d\u03a6  and dQ  comprise 2n  column vectors of j\u03c6  and jq  \nrespectively, such that mode 1...2j n\uf03d  is defined by jq , the vector of 2n  nodal force \ncoefficients required at the boundary to cause displacements given by the \ncorresponding 2n  nodal displacement coefficients in vector j\u03c6 .

In a similar way to this \nFEM theory, matrices 1B  and 2B  are related to the polynomial shape functions, D  is \nthe constitutive matrix and J  is the Jacobian. The vector of 2n  modal participation \nfactors c  is given by \n 1\nd\n\uf02d\uf03dc \u03a6 u  (6) \nwhere u  is the vector of 2n  nodal displacements on the boundary. The equivalent \nforces required to cause these boundary displacements are \n 1\nd d d\n\uf02d\uf03d \uf03dP Q c Q \u03a6 u  (7) \nthus it follows the stiffness matrix is given by \n 1\nd d\n\uf02d\uf03dK Q \u03a6  (8) \nso that \n \uf03dKu P  (9) \nUnlike in the conventional FEM, the system of equations governing the SBFEM, and \nits construction, comprises boundary nodal displacements and forces only, without the \nneed for volumetric discretisation, or discretisation of some sections of boundary (side \nfaces). However, it should be noted that the solution of equation (2) is \ncomputationally inefficient as in finding the bounded domain mode shapes, for \nexample, the unbounded domain mode shapes are found as a by-product, when \nperhaps just one case is of interest. \n \nThe SBFEM suffers also from a \u2018line of sight\u2019 meshing requirement [1] that limits its \napplicability. Though this can be overcome by substructuring the domain into \nmultiple SBFEM subdomains [15], this can still prove awkward when meshing \ndomains that would be modelled by the BEM or FEM with relative ease. This is one \nof the principal motivating factors for the current work. \n3.2 Coupled BE-SBFEM \nThe following overview of the coupled BE-SBFEM briefly describes its formulation \nand assumes some prior knowledge of its constituent methods. Throughout the \nderivation, subscripts B  and S  are used to denote the BEM and SBFEM subdomains \nrespectively, separated by a common interface denoted by subscript I . For simplicity, \nthe derivation focuses on the coupling of two subdomains in two dimensions such as \nin Figure 2, where a domain \uf057  is divided into a BEM subdomain B\uf057  and a SBFEM \nsubdomain S\uf057  bounded by B\uf047  and S\uf047  respectively, and separated by a common \ninterface I\uf047 . The additional subscript J  denotes junction degrees of freedom, i.e. \nthose associated with the nodes found at the junction of the boundaries B\uf047  , S\uf047  and \nI\n\uf047 . The two junction nodes are denoted J1 and J2, as illustrated in Figure 2.

An optimum value for \uf059  \nmay not be known a priori, but an appropriate value can be based on the Young\u2019s \nmodulus and the size and type of the domain under analysis. \n3.4 Additional BEM considerations \nThe SBFEM requires S\uf047  be meshed using continuous elements. Consequently, the \ninterface I\uf047  must be meshed using continuous elements in order to provide a fully \ncontinuous SBFEM subdomain boundary. However, the BEM boundary B\uf047  can be \nmeshed using either continuous or discontinuous elements, or some combination of \nthe two types. Thus, consideration must be made when using discontinuous boundary \nelements within the coupled BE-SBFEM. \n \nCollocation using the BEM requires the use of singular integration routines to \nevaluate singular integrals when integrating over the section of boundary (element) on \nwhich the collocation point lies. At both J1 and J2 there are junctions between the \ndiscontinuous elements on the boundary and the continuous elements on the interface. \nIt should be noted that when collocating at J1 and J2 and integrating over the adjacent \nelement on B\uf047 , if the element is of the discontinuous type, a singular integration \nscheme is required [26], even though the node does not contribute to the set of nodes \ndefining the element geometry. \n4 Results \n4.1 Analytical verification \n4.1.1 Through crack in an infinite plate example 1 \nA BE-SBFEM model of dimensions b h\uf0b4  is defined in the immediate vicinity of the \ntip of a crack of length 2a  central to an infinite plate subject to a uniaxial load of \uf073 , \nsuch that the section of crack face modelled is of length a , and the crack tip is \ncoincident with the SBFEM scaling centre \u02c6 \u02c6( , )x y , as shown in Figure 3. \n 9 \n\uf0a5\uf057\n\uf073\n2a\nBEM\nSBFEM\nInterface\n\u02c6 \u02c6( , )x y\nS\n\uf057\nB\n\uf057\nI\n\uf047\n2a\nBEM\nSBFEM\nS\n\uf057\nB\n\uf057\ncrack face\ntip\n\uf071\nr\ny\nu r \uf071( , )\nx\nu r \uf071( , )\nJ2\nJ1\na\nL\nA\nR\nA\na\nb\nh\n(a) (b)\n(c)(d)\n  \nFigure 3.

Displacement boundary conditions given by equations (22) and \n(23) are prescribed on all sections of B\uf047  and S\uf047 , except where traction-free boundary \nconditions can be applied, i.e. in the x-direction to sections of B\uf047  where 0\uf071 \uf03d , and \nside faces LA  and RA , and junction node J1, and in the y-direction to the side face LA\n. Other than the assumed continuity between B\uf057  and S\uf057 , no boundary conditions are \napplied to I\uf047  and its nodal displacements remain as unknowns to be solved. Without \nloss of generality, the model is meshed with en  quadratic elements per discretised line \non boundaries B\uf047  , S\uf047  and I\uf047 , totalling n degrees of freedom in the coupled system, \nwhich is solved for unknown nodal tractions and displacements. \n \nThe accuracy of the i-direction displacement iu s\uf078( , )  at some point within S\uf057  is \ndependent on both the accuracy of the nodal displacement 1iu s( , ) , and the force and \ndisplacement modes computed prior to forming the stiffness matrix in equation (8). In \nthis example, the majority of the nodal displacements 1iu s( , )  are prescribed as \nboundary conditions so it would be inappropriate to use them to determine the \naccuracy of the BE-SBFEM. Instead, values of iu s\uf078( , )  are computed according to the \nboundary coordinates where 1iu s( , )  is not prescribed. Regions within S\uf057  can be \ndefined whose displacements can be computed without the bias of prescribed \nboundary conditions, denoted by Si\uf057  where \n S min max0 1i s s s s i x y\uf078 \uf078\uf057 \uf03d \uf03c \uf0a3 \uf03c \uf03c \uf03d: ( , ), , , ,  (27) \nas illustrated by the shaded regions in Figure 4. \n \nNodal displacements can be extracted directly; non-nodal displacements can be \nestimated by interpolating nodal displacement values. To maintain high accuracy, \nsample points are taken along axes of constant s  that coincide with the boundary \ncoordinates of the nodes such that this interpolation is not necessary. Interior sample \npoints are defined by the intersection of these axes and the bn  contours (or scaled \nboundaries) sampled within the region, and are illustrated by the example in Figure 4, \nwhere 8bn \uf03d . \n 11 \n0\uf078 \uf03d 1\uf078 \uf03d\n1\uf078 \uf03d\nR\nALA\ns\nmax\ns\nmin\ns\n(a)\nSx\n\uf057\n0\uf078 \uf03d 1\uf078 \uf03d\n1\uf078 \uf03d\nR\nALA\ns\nmax\ns\nmin\ns\n(b)\nSy\n\uf057\n1\uf078 \uf03d\n \nFigure 4.

Sample contour plots of s i\uf065 \uf078( , , )  estimated \nwithin the ranges defined in equation (27) are shown in Figure 5. \n \nThe convergence of IK  results with n  is presented in Figure 6. Results are shown \nusing a family of curves, each considering IK  as derived from BE-SBFEM results \nobtained using {0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9}\uf078 \uf03d . It should be noted that IK  can be established \nfrom the results at any point in Si\uf057 , and the errors illustrated in Figure 6 are used as \nan indicator of suitable regions within which to choose such a point. \n \nBy increasing en , not only does the accuracy at individual points increase, the range \n\uf028 \uf029s s\uf02dmax min  is extended allowing a greater total number of sample points to be taken \nwithin Si\uf057 . Increasing this range shows that the highest errors occur typically in the \nregion close to 0s \uf03d . Moreover, it can be seen that the errors are significantly lower \nin y-direction degrees of freedom than those in the x-direction. Further, the results do \nnot necessarily exhibit greater accuracy at 1\uf078 \uf03d . These observations are significant as \n[22] use the x-direction displacement at ( , ) (1,0)s\uf078 \uf03d  to estimate IK , where errors are \npotentially among their highest. \n \n 12 \nDisplacements in this type of problem are dominated by those in the y-direction, thus \nthe percentage errors s y\uf065 \uf078( , , )  are expected a priori to be lower than s x\uf065 \uf078( , , ) . With \nthis knowledge, a convergence estimate is defined by max1 s y\uf065 ( , , )  where errors are \npredicted to be amongst their lowest.

Convergence of error in estimation of KI with increase in calculated using y-direction \ndisplacements at s=smax \n4.1.2 Through crack in an infinite plate example 2 \nIn the previous example, \uf057  is sufficiently trivial for the SBFEM to model alone. \nHowever, one attractive property of the coupled BE-SBFEM is its ability to model \ncomplicated geometries under fracture analysis. The choice of geometry around the \ncrack tip used to model a  in this verification process is arbitrary. The square region \nof dimensions h b\uf0b4  may be replaced by a more complicated geometry because the \nanalytical solutions used in both the application of boundary conditions and the \ncomparison of nodal displacement solutions are independent of model geometry. \nThus, in the following example, the crack tip region is modelled by S\uf057  coupled to a \nmore complicated B\uf057  where the same method of comparison to an analytical solution \nis available. \n \nThe model and example results are shown in Figure 7 from which it can be seen that \nthe complexity of the problem has little effect on the convergence characteristics of \nthe method. \n \n 14 \n(b)\n(a)\n1000\na\n2a\nm\nax\ns\ny\n\uf065\n\uf078(\n,\n,\n)\n n\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200\n10\n-3\n10\n-2\n10\n-1\n10\n0\n..\\data\\BE-SBFEM infinite through crack2 2\\\nconvergence of K1 % error usingy-direction displacements at s=smax\nn\n%\n e\nrr\no\nr\n \n \n\uf078=0.1\n\uf078=0.3\n\uf078=0.5\n\uf078=0.7\n\uf078=0.9\n \nFigure 7.

(a) the BEM and SBFEM subdomains around the crack tip, and (b) the convergence of \nerror in estimation of KI with increase in calculated using y-direction displacements at s=smax \n4.2 Strategy for estimation of stress intensity factor \nThe foregoing examples demonstrate that the accuracy to which IK  can be estimated \nby IK s i\uf078( , , )  is dependent upon both the choice of location of the point Ss\uf078 \uf0ce\uf057( , ) , \nand also the displacement component at that point, used to determine the estimate \nusing equations (22) and (23). However, the optimal values of these parameters are \nproblem-dependent, so the purpose of the analytical verification is to establish a \nstrategy for the estimation of stress intensity factors for general problems of this \nnature, for which analytical solutions may not be available. \n \n 15 \nBased on the analytical verification, this strategy is summarised as using: \n\uf0b7 displacements in direction of the predicted maximum displacement ; \n\uf0b7 displacements that are of greatest magnitude, i.e. those in the region around \nthe crack opening; \n\uf0b7 displacements that are in the immediate vicinity of the crack tip, so that \nequations (22) and (23) are valid. \n4.3 Numerical verification \n4.3.1 Through crack in a finite plate \nA BE-SBFEM model of dimensions h b\uf0b4  is used to model a through crack of length \n2a  central to a finite plate of dimensions 2 2h b\uf0b4  with subject to a uniaxial load of \uf073\n, as shown in Figure 8.

An analytical \n 16 \nreference solution is unavailable for this problem, and stated reference values are \npresented with insufficient precision for this purpose. However, given the accuracy \ndemonstrated in examples 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, errors are taken relative to the converged \nsolution \nI\nK i\uf078( , )  as, defined by \n I I\nI\n100\nK s i K i\ns i\nK i\n\uf078 \uf078\n\uf065 \uf078\n\uf078\n\uf02d\n\uf03d \uf0b4\n( , , ) ( , )\n( , , ) %\n( , )\n (29) \nFigure 9 shows the converged solution for samples of -5{0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9} 10\uf078 \uf03d \uf0b4 , \nfound using y-direction displacements.

(a) The finite plate with edge crack and (b) the BE-SBFEM model \nFollowing the same strategy as before, errors are indicated by equation (29) as an \nanalytical reference solution for this problem is unavailable, and are summarised in \nFigure 11. In this example, the five converged results range from \nI\n2 644K \uf03d .  to \nI\n2 645K \uf03d . , which compare favourably with the value of I 2 66K \uf03d .  estimated by \nPortela et al. [30], achieved using the DBEM in which a reference value of I 2 64K \uf03d .  \nis cited [31]. It should also be noted that while convergence was reached by Portela et \nal with 144n \uf03d , their initial mesh was graded. In the present work, the model is \nmeshed uniformly with convergence (to 2 s.f.) at 130n \uf03d . Further, because the mesh \nis refined uniformly, the majority of the additional degrees of freedom appear on B\uf047 , \nand as shown in the example in 4.1.2, the distribution of degrees of freedom in B\uf057  \nhas little contribution to the increase in accuracy with n . Thus, with a graded mesh, \nthe BE-SBFEM solution may converge faster still. \n 18 \nn n\nI\n0\n.5\nM\nP\na\nm\nm\nK\ns\ny\n\uf078(\n,\n,\n)\ns\ny\n\uf065\n\uf078(\n,\n,\n)\n(a) (b)\n10\n1\n10\n2\n10\n3\n10\n-3\n10\n-2\n10\n-1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n..\\data\\BE-SBFEM finite edge crack2 2\\\nconvergence of K1 % error usingy-direction displacements at s=smax\nn\n%\n e\nrr\no\nr\n \n \n\uf078=1.0e-005\n\uf078=3.0e-005\n\uf078=5.0e-005\n\uf078=7.0e-005\n\uf078=9.0e-005\n50 100 150 200 250 300\n2.45\n2.5\n2.55\n2.6\n2.65\n2.7\n..\\data\\BE-SBFEM finite edge crack2 2\\\nconvergence of K1 % error usingy-direction displacements at s=smax\nn\n%\n e\nrr\no\nr\n \n \n\uf078=1.0e-005\n\uf078=3.0e-005\n\uf078=5.0e-005\n\uf078=7.0e-005\n\uf078=9.0e-005\n \nFigure 11.

Though this value may not be an accurate optimum \nfor a minimum condition number, it can be seen that this is not necessary as sufficient \nreductions can be made simply by the use of a scale factor of a suitable order of \nmagnitude.  \nsy\nst\ne\nm\n m\nat\nri\nx\n c\no\nn\nd\nit\nio\nn\n n\nu\nm\nb\ner\n \n\uf059\n10\n0\n10\n2\n10\n4\n10\n6\n10\n8\n10\n10\n10\n6\n10\n7\n10\n8\n10\n9\n10\n10\n10\n11\n10\n12\n13\n \n \nFigure 12. Effect of varying traction scaling parameter on the condition number of the coupled \nBE-SBFEM system matrix A \n 19 \nAll the results published in this paper have been generated using code developed in \nMATLAB, making use of the \u2018backslash\u2019 operator mldivide\u2020, a function that selects a \nsolver appropriate for the type of system to be solved. Consequently, ill-conditioned \nsystems of the order 1310 , such as found by selecting 1\uf059 \uf03d  in both analytical \nverification examples, were solved to the same level of accuracy as those with \n610\uf059 \uf03d . However, should the method be written without such solvers, care should be \ntaken to avoid ill-conditioning by selecting an appropriate scaling factor, such that the \nterms in the influence matrices, H  and \uf059G , are of the same order of magnitude. \nAnalysis of Figure 12, and similar curves produced for different problems of the type \nanalysed in the present work, suggests 610\uf059 \uf0bb  is suitable in all the examined cases. \nThus, for all examples considered in the present work a scale factor of 610\uf059 \uf03d  was \nused. The choice of scale factor will be dependent on the material properties and \nproblem dimensions. \n5 Conclusions \nThis research has highlighted some issues arising from the coupling of the BEM and \nSBFEM. The coupled BE-SBFEM has been developed for applications to linear \nelastic fracture mechanics, with the view to establishing an efficient method for \nmodelling a crack tip region within a general domain. Restrictions in boundary \nconditions imposed in the earlier development of Chidgzey et al. [22] have been \novercome in the present work. The BE-SBFEM has compared favourably with \nexamples whose solutions are analytical in nature. Further, the BE-SBFEM has \ndemonstrated geometric flexibility by modelling irregular domains with few degrees \nof freedom, and without the cumbersome substructuring requirements a SBFEM-only \napproach would make. A strategy has been hypothesised for determining with \nconfidence the stress intensity factor of problems more typical of practical \nengineering applications. Following this strategy, stress intensity factor estimations \nhave shown to offer good convergence. The condition number of the system matrix \nhas been shown to be sensitive to the range of the orders of magnitude of terms in the \nBEM traction and displacement influence matrices. Ill-conditioning that may occur in \nexamples of a real engineering nature may be reduced the use of an appropriate \ntraction scale factor.  \n6 Acknowledgements \nThe first author acknowledges gratefully the financial support offered jointly by the \nEngineering and Physical Research Council (EPSRC) and the School of Engineering, \nDurham University. \nReferences \n[1] Deeks, A.J. and J.P.
