Introduction\nElectronic transport properties in quasi-one-dimensional wires have gained much attention,\nnot only due to scientific interest but also due to practical applications [1]. When an electron\nis restricted to a wire, confinement subbands are formed due to quantization of the transverse\nmomentum. In clean straight wires without impurities the modes of the subbands decouple,\nwhich results in a perfectly quantized conductance. However, the modes (including evanescent\nones) mix when impurities are introduced into the wire, and the transport properties show a rich\nand non-trivial behaviour. Detailed aspects of the mixing have been extensively investigated\n[2\u20137]. The impurities put into the wire usually give rise to bound states, which can be separated\ninto two categories: true bound states with real energy and quasibound states with complex\nenergy. The imaginary part determines the decay rate of the quasibound state.\nEven in simple one-dimensional (1D) scattering problems quasibound states are quite\ncommon, for example resonant transmission states through a double barrier [8, 9] and\nRamsauer-like resonances [10] in potential wells. According to the Breit\u2013Wigner theory\n[11], for each quasibound state the transmission amplitude possesses a pole in the complex\n0305-4470\/03\/051299+16$30.00 \u00a9 2003 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK 1299\n1300 S W Kim et al\nenergy plane. In multichannel scattering problems another kind of quasibound states can\nappear; the Fano-type resonance originally proposed to explain auto-ionization in atomic\nphysics [12]. When a discrete energy level interferes with a continuum of states, the excitation\nspectra become asymmetric. Each subband mode in a quasi-1D wire gives rise to a zero-pole\npair of transmission in the complex energy plane, where the zero occurs on the real energy axis.\nAs a consequence, there exist transmission zeros, and the zero-pole pairs lead to asymmetric\nresonance features [13].\nTransport through a time-dependent (mostly periodically oscillating) potential is also a\nsubject of increasing importance, with a growing number of applications [14\u201323]. One of\nthe important features here is that an oscillating potential can transfer an incoming electron\nof energy E with finite probability to \u2018Floquet\u2019 sidebands at E \u00b1 nh\u00af\u03c9, where n is an integer\nand \u03c9 is the angular frequency of the oscillation. Even though this corresponds to an inelastic\nscattering, the process is coherent and non-dissipative. Hence, it can still be regarded as a\nmultichannel scattering problem as in the quasi-1D case, with the sidebands being analogous\nto the subbands. However, from the physical point of view, the Fano-type quasibound states\nof the periodically oscillating impurity are somewhat different from those of quasi-1D system\n[24]. If a bound state exists due to an attractive static potential added to the oscillating\npotential, electrons in the incident channel can emit photons and drop to the bound state, and\nsimilarly electrons in the bound state can absorb photons and jump to the incident channel. A\ntransmission resonance takes place when the energy difference between the incident channel\nand the bound state is equal to the energy of one or more photons of the oscillating potential.\nEven without bound states transmission resonances such as these can occur.\nThe multichannel subbands in the quasi-1D case and the Floquet sidebands in the\noscillating potential case divide the complex energy plane into sub-domains with appropriate\nboundary conditions for the quasibound states. Upon varying an external parameter such as\nthe strength of the impurity potential, the quasibound states change their location in complex\nenergy plane. In the literature [20] it was claimed for the oscillating impurity that the\nquasibound state vanishes when the transmission zero collides with the sub-domain boundary\nand disappears. However, as we will demonstrate, the transmission line shape, the Friedel\nsum rule, and the delay time show that the quasibound states do not disappear abruptly. This\nclarifies the relation between threshold behaviour of transmission resonances, and quasibound\nstates and their boundary conditions in the general context of multichannel scatterings.\nIn section 2, we briefly summarize our findings about the transmission resonances and\nquasibound states. In section 3, we investigate the characteristics of quasibound states in the\nscattering problem with a 1D oscillating delta-function impurity, and discuss Friedel sum rule\nand Wigner delay time. In section 4, we study our second example, the scattering from a static\ndelta-function impurity in a quasi-1D wire. Finally, we conclude our paper in section 5.\n2. Boundary conditions of quasibound states in multichannel scattering\nIn this section we summarize the main finding of this paper, which will be further illustrated\nin sections 3 and 4. The transmission coefficient tmn(E) relates the incoming wave \u03c8inn to the\nscattered wave \u03c8scm by\n\u03c8scm (E) = tmn(E)\u03c8inn . (1)\nThe resonance energies are found by locating the poles of tmn(E), namely\n1\ntmn(ER \u2212 iEI) = 0. (2)\nQuasibound states at thresholds in multichannel impurity scattering 1301\nThe poles of tmn(E) occur at complex energies E = ER \u2212 iEI . At these complex energies,\na scattered wave can be produced even if no incident wave is present. When we choose\nthe sign convention of time as exp(\u2212iEt\/h\u00af), EI must be positive for the system to be\nstable. In the Breit\u2013Wigner case [11] the transmission near the quasibound state is given by\nt (E) \u223c 1\/[E \u2212 (ER \u2212 iEI)], where the pole in complex energy plane completely determines\nthe transmission line shape.\nThe poles can also be found by solving the wave equation with the appropriate boundary\nconditions of only outgoing waves. This can be described by the following linear equation\nM\n(\n\u03c8lout\n\u03c8rout\n)\n= 0. (3)\nHere M is the matrix of wave-matching conditions, and \u03c8lout and \u03c8rout are the left and the right\noutgoing wave vectors, respectively. The matrix M contains the wave number k as a function\nof energy E. For real E the wave number k is given by k = \u221a2\u00b5E\/h\u00af, where \u00b5 is the mass.\nFor complex energies, we have to choose the sign of the square root carefully. Considering\nthe general relation [25]\n\u221a\n\u03b1 + i\u03b2 = \u00b1\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\u221a\n\u03b1 +\n\u221a\n\u03b12 + \u03b22\n2\n+ i\n\u03b2\n|\u03b2|\n\u221a\n\u2212\u03b1 +\n\u221a\n\u03b12 + \u03b22\n2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (4)\nprovided that \u03b2 \u0003= 0, we obtain\u221a\nER \u2212 iEI = \u00b1(kR \u2212 ikI ) (5)\nwhere by definition EI , kR and kI are positive. The real energy ER > 0 for propagating states,\nand ER < 0 for evanescent states. The correct choice of the sign in equation (5) depends\non the analytical continuation based on the physical constraints on the real energy axis. For\nEI = 0 the following relation should be satisfied,\u221a\nER =\n{\nkR ER > 0\nikI ER < 0\n(6)\nwhere both kR and kI are still positive. The choice of sign for propagating states corresponds\nto the choice of the negative sign for kI (i.e. the positive sign for kR), and follows from the\npropagating direction of the plane wave far from the scatterer. For evanescent states, the\npositive sign for kI must be chosen in order to avoid divergence of the solution in space.\nIt is worth noting that the \u2018+\u2019 sign corresponds to the decaying wave exp(ikRx \u2212\nkIx) exp(\u2212iERt\/h\u00af\u2212EI t\/h\u00af) while the \u2018\u2212\u2019 sign corresponds to the diverging wave exp(ikRx +\nkIx) exp(\u2212iERt\/h\u00af \u2212 EI t\/h\u00af), with x > 0. The physical reason of the exponential divergence\nof the channels with positive real energy is a retardation effect; the wave at x \u0004 1 has\npropagated away from the impurity where it originated at a time \u0005t \u2248 x\/v in the past,\nwhere v is the velocity of the wave. However, at that earlier time the amplitude of the wave\nat the impurity was larger by a factor exp(EI\u0005t\/h\u00af). This corresponds to exp(kI x) since\n(ER \u2212 iEI)\/h\u00af \u0006 v(kR \u2212 ikI )\/2 [26].\nFor multichannel scattering, the wave numbers are given by\nkn = \u00b1\n\u221a\nER \u2212 En \u2212 iEI (7)\nwhere En represents the quantized energy of a transverse mode in the quasi-1D case (n =\n1, 2, 3, . . .) and is equal to nh\u00af\u03c9 in the 1D oscillating potential case (n = . . . ,\u22121, 0, 1, . . .).\nWe order the En by magnitude and denote by n\u2217 the special value of n which satisfies\nEn\u2217 < ER < En\u2217+1.\n1302 S W Kim et al\nEn*+1En*\nER\nDn*\n(a)\n(b)\nEn*En*-1 En*+1 En*+2\nDn*Dn*-1 Dn*+1\nFigure 1. (a) Schematic diagram for possible motion of quasibound states in the complex energy\nplane. En and Dn denote subband threshold energies and domains, respectively. (b) Schematic of\nthe proper Riemann surface R of the domain Dn\u2217 in the complex energy plane. The circles and the\npeaks represent the transmission zeros and the quasibound states (or poles), respectively.\nIn order to satisfy the physical conditions for the signs of kn mentioned above, for n \u0001 n\u2217\nthe \u2018\u2212\u2019 sign should be chosen for Im kn, and for n > n\u2217 the \u2018+\u2019 sign, which corresponds to\nthe selection of a certain Riemann sheet for evaluating the complex square root function. This\nchoice of the signs will be called proper Riemann sheet since this set of signs corresponds to\nthe correct analytical continuation from the real energy axis. In order to represent the Riemann\nsheet through the signs of Im k such as in our convention, the square root functions should\nhave their branch cuts on the real axis starting from the branch points and extending to the\npositive infinity. In general, the notion Riemann sheet depends on the choice of a branch cut.\nHowever, this choice of the branch cut cannot affect physical results, because it is only a way\nto label the projection of the Riemann sheets onto the complex plane.\nWe introduce a labelling for the Riemann sheets by the vector of signs of the square root\nfunction. In this notation the proper Riemann sheet is represented by (. . . ,\u2212,\u2212,\b,+,+, . . .),\nwhich implies \u2018\u2212\u2019 for Im kn\u2217\u22122, \u2018\u2212\u2019 for Im kn\u2217\u22121, \u2018\u2212\u2019 for Im kn\u2217 , \u2018+\u2019 for Im kn\u2217+1, and \u2018+\u2019 for\nIm kn\u2217+2, and \b has been used to indicate the sign of n\u2217. We also call the regions of complex\nenergies separated by the quantized energies En \u2018domains\u2019, e.g. Dn represents the region\nwith En < ER < En+1 as shown in figure 1(a).\nAs a parameter of the scattering potential such as its strength is varied, the locations of\nthe poles change continuously and sometimes can collide with the boundary of the initial\ndomain. We can trace the pole into the neighbouring domain through the boundary, for\nexample from Dn\u2217 to Dn\u2217\u22121 in figure 1(a). In fact, the trajectory of the pole across the\nboundary is continuous and smooth once we use the same Riemann sheet as that used in Dn\u2217 ,\nQuasibound states at thresholds in multichannel impurity scattering 1303\ni.e. (. . . ,\u2212,\u2212,\b,+,+, . . .). However, this does not correspond to the proper Riemann sheet\n(. . . ,\u2212,\u2212,\u2295,+,+, . . .) in this new domain Dn\u2217\u22121 since the inequality En\u2217 < ER is violated.\nThus, the solution obtained in Dn\u2217\u22121 using the proper Riemann sheet of Dn\u2217 does not have\nany physical meaning in the domain Dn\u2217\u22121 (more precisely on the real axis of Dn\u2217\u22121), but still\ncan influence physics on the real axis of Dn\u2217 , especially when the resonance is broad. Let us\nemphasize that only the branch points, En, play an important role in the threshold behaviour of\ntransmission resonances, but not the placement of the cuts. Physics is in the choice of signs on\nthe real energy axis, equation (5). This situation is summarized schematically in figure 1(b),\nwhich shows that only small part of the proper Riemann sheet of Dn\u2217 , i.e. En\u2217 < ER < En\u2217+1,\nis attached to the real energy axis. Since in either Dn\u2217\u22121 or Dn\u2217+1 the quasibound state\ncan survive on the proper Riemann sheet of Dn\u2217 , it can still affect the physics in the region\nEn\u2217 < ER < En\u2217+1, but has no effect on other parts of real axis. In the following sections we\ndiscuss two examples.\n3. 1D delta-function impurity with time dependence\nAs the first example we investigate a 1D scattering problem with a delta-function impurity\noscillating at frequency \u03c9. This problem was studied before by Bagwell and Lake [4], who\ncalculated electron transmission and discussed transmission resonances. Recently, Martinez\nand Reichl [20] have investigated this problem and found the existence of nonresonant bands in\nthe transmission amplitude as a function of the strength of the potential and driving frequency.\nThey observed a periodic behaviour of the conductance as a function of the scattering strength\nand of the oscillation frequency of the scatterer.\n3.1. Scattering matrix formulation\nThe system is described by the Hamiltonian\nH(x, t) = \u2212 h\u00af\n2\n2\u00b5\nd2\ndx2\n+ [Vs + Vd cos(\u03c9t)]\u03b4(x) (8)\nwhere the \u00b5 is the mass of an incident particle, and Vs and Vd represent the strength of the\nstatic and the oscillating potential, respectively. Using the Floquet formalism [27] the solution\nof this Hamiltonian can be expressed as\n\u0007EFl (x, t) = e\u2212iEFl t\/h\u00af\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u03c8n(x) e\n\u2212in\u03c9t (9)\nwhere EFl is the Floquet energy which takes continuous values in the interval 0 < EFl \u0001 h\u00af\u03c9.\nSince the potential is zero everywhere except at x = 0, \u03c8n(x) is given by the following\nform,\n\u03c8n(x) =\n{\nAn e\niknx + Bn e\u2212iknx x < 0\nCn e\niknx + Dn e\u2212iknx x > 0\n(10)\nwhere kn =\n\u221a\n2\u00b5(EFl + nh\u00af\u03c9)\/h\u00af. The wavefunction \u0007EFl (x, t) is continuous at x = 0,\nAn + Bn = Cn + Dn (11)\nand the derivative jumps by\nd\u0007EFl\ndx\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nx=0+\n\u2212 d\u0007EFl\ndx\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nx=0\u2212\n= 2m\nh\u00af2\n[Vs + Vd cos(\u03c9t)]\u0007EFl (0, t). (12)\n1304 S W Kim et al\nUsing equation (9) this leads to the condition\nikn(Cn \u2212 Dn \u2212 An + Bn) = \u03b3s(An + Bn) + \u03b3d(An+1 + An\u22121 + Bn+1 + Bn\u22121) (13)\n= \u03b3s(Cn + Dn) + \u03b3d(Cn+1 + Cn\u22121 + Dn+1 + Dn\u22121) (14)\nwhere \u03b3s = 2\u00b5Vs\/h\u00af2 and \u03b3d = \u00b5Vd\/h\u00af2.

Equation (15) can also be expressed\nin the form |out\u3009 = M |in\u3009, where M connects the input coefficients to the output\ncoefficients including the associated evanescent Floquet sidebands. In order to construct\nthe scattering matrix we multiply an identity to both sides, K\u22121K |out\u3009 = MK\u22121K |in\u3009,\nwhere Knm =\n\u221a\nkn\u03b4nm. Then we have \u000bJ out = \u00afM \u000bJ in, where \u000bJ represents the amplitude of\nprobability flux and \u00afM \u2261 KMK\u22121. It should be mentioned that \u00afM is not unitary due to the\nevanescent modes included.\nIf we keep only the propagating modes, we obtain the unitary scattering matrix S [21, 24],\nwhich can be expressed in the following form,\nS =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nr00 r01 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 t \u203200 t \u203201 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nr10 r11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 t \u203210 t \u203211 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n...\n...\n. . .\n...\n...\n. . .\nt00 t01 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 r \u203200 r \u203201 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nt10 t11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 r \u203210 r \u203211 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n...\n...\n. . .\n...\n...\n. . .\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n(17)\nwhere rnm and tnm are the reflection and the transmission amplitudes, respectively, for modes\nincident from the left; r \u2032nm and t \u2032nm are similar quantities for modes incident from the right.\nFrom S we can obtain the total transmission coefficient for the propagating mode entering in\nthe mth channel,\nTm(EFl) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n|tnm|2 .

Quasibound states\nIn order to obtain quasibound states we apply the same procedure used in the previous\nsubsection, but with the different boundary conditions, A = 0 and D = 0.

We solve equation (19) for given as and ad by using singular value\ndecomposition [28] and find the complex energies of the quasibound states.\nDue to the structure of the matrix in equation (19), if \u03b5\u2032 is a solution of equation (19),\nthen \u03b5\u2032 + n is also a solution, where n is an integer. We limit ourselves to the energy range\nof 0 < \u03b5R \u0001 1, which means that the poles are meaningful only in the domain D0. This\nconstraint determines the signs of the complex square root functions in the diagonal of the\nmatrix in equation (19) as described in section 2. Using the same notation as that used in\nsection 2 the signs can be expressed by (. . . ,+,+,\b,\u2212,\u2212, . . .).\nFigure 3(a) shows a trajectory of the quasibound state as ad is varied with as = 0.

The open circles\nrepresent the trajectory of the quasibound state continued into the neighbouring domains on the\nproper Riemann sheet of D0. The quasibound state of the third branch from the top appears from\nthe real axis at ad \u0006 1.869, and collides with \u03b5R = 1 and 0 at ad \u0006 2.325 and 2.935, respectively\n(see the text for the first and the second branches). Insets: absolute squares of the solution vectors\n\u000bC of equation (19) at ad = 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 from the top, respectively. (b) Trajectory of quasibound\nstates as ad increases (as = \u22120.2). At ad = 0 the quasibound state is located at \u03b5 = 0.8 due\nto the existence of a bound state, with binding energy \u03b5B = 0.2. The quasibound state collides\nwith \u03b5R = 0 at ad \u0006 0.46. A second branch of quasibound states appears from the real axis at\nad \u0006 0.525, and collides with \u03b5R = 1 and 0 at ad \u0006 0.645 and 1.22, respectively. Finally, a third\nbranch appears from the real axis at ad \u0006 1.221, and collides with \u03b5R = 1 and 0 at ad \u0006 1.475\nand 2.035, respectively.\ntowards the domain D\u22121, and crosses the domain boundary \u03b5R = 0 at ad \u0006 0.935. The\ntrajectory of the pole helps to understand the transmission curves in figure 2. The resonance\nstructure of the transmission follows the pole, as is shown in figure 2 and the inset of\nfigure 2(a). Since in the system considered here the transmission zero always takes place\non the left of the pole in the real energy direction, it collides with the domain boundary\n\u03b5R = 1 prior to the pole and disappears first at ad \u0006 0.782. In [20] it is concluded\nthat the quasibound state vanishes when the transmission zero disappears. Even after the\npole moves out of the domain D0 it still affects the transmission line shape, as shown in\nfigure 2(c). There is no abrupt change of physical quantities, e.g. the transmissions, the\nQuasibound states at thresholds in multichannel impurity scattering 1307\nFriedel phases and the Wigner delay time (these two will be shown below). The transmission\nzero disappears when it collides with the point (0, 0). We can trace the transmission zero even\ninto the non-physical region \u03b5R < 0 by calculating S matrix on the proper Riemann sheet of\nD0, although the unitarity of the S matrix is violated.\nA quasibound state of a second branch appears from the real axis at ad \u0006 1.032 and\nmoves to the left. It passes through the domain boundaries \u03b5R = 1 at ad \u0006 1.31, while the\ntransmission zero appears in advance at ad \u0006 1.165 as shown in figure 2(d ). The pole finally\nleaves the domain D0 by passing \u03b5R = 0 at ad \u0006 1.935. The second branch of the pole exactly\ncorresponds to the case of the schematic shown in figure 1(b). In fact, one can find more\nbranches of quasibound states in a regular fashion [20]. It is noted, however, that the branches\nqualitatively differ in their solution vectors, i.e. the null space of the matrix of equation (19)\nat the energy of quasibound state as shown in the insets of figure 3(a).\nFigure 3(b) shows the trajectory of the pole in the case of a delta-function impurity with\nan attractive static potential added to the oscillating potential. A similar behaviour as in\nfigure 3(a) is observed. The shifted starting point from \u03b5 = 1 at ad = 0 is ascribed to the\nexistence of the true bound state of an attractive delta-function potential with binding energy\nEB = \u2212\u00b5V 2s\n\/\n2h\u00af2. The introduction of the static potential has no effect on the signs of the\ncomplex square root functions, i.e. the Riemann sheet, which is clear in equation (19).\nAn interesting difference takes place in the trajectory of the quasibound states in the\noscillating delta-function impurity when the attractive static potential is present. For small\nad the matrix in equation (19) can be approximated by a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix involving only k\u22121, k0\nand k1, which corresponds to single-photon processes (absorption and emission). Using the\nresults of appendix B of [4] it can be seen that this 3 \u00d7 3 matrix is not enough for the case\nwithout a static potential to describe the shift along the real energy axis of the quasibound\nstates as ad is increased. At least a 5 \u00d7 5 matrix is needed to include the shift, which implies\ntwo-photon process. The mathematical reason is the fact that the slope d\u03b5I\/d\u03b5R|ad=0 = \u221e\nin figure 3(a). On the other hand, in the case with an attractive potential 3 \u00d7 3 matrix is\nenough to obtain a shift of the pole along the real energy axis, as shown in figure 3(b) because\nd\u03b5I\/d\u03b5R|ad=0 has a finite value. With an attractive potential, a bound state already exists, and\nthe oscillating potential leads to an ac-Stark shift [29] of that energy level. Without a static\npotential, however, one photon is needed to generate a bound state, and additional photons are\nneeded to produce the ac-Stark-like shift.\n3.3. Friedel sum rule\nThe number NB of bound states below an energy Ef (say, the Fermi energy) is related to the\nFriedel phase \u03b8F = ln Det(S)\/2i of the scattering matrix S through the Friedel sum rule [30]\n(see also [31])\nNB = 1\n\u03c0\n\u03b8F (Ef ). (20)\nThis implies that each bound state contributes \u03c0 to the Friedel phase. Let us note that the\nscattering matrix in equation (17) is given as a function of a Floquet energy \u03b5F l (\u2261EFl\/h\u00af\u03c9)\nand the same holds for the Friedel phase, i.e. it is only relevant for 0 \u0001 \u03b5 < 1. Figures 4(a)\nand (b) show Friedel phases as a function of \u03b5F l for ad = 0.6 (the pole is located in D0) and\nad = 1.0 (the pole is in D\u22121), respectively, with as = 0. No abrupt change of the Friedel phase\nis observed at the threshold ad \u0006 0.782 of the transmission zero or when the pole crosses the\ndomain boundary, ad \u0006 0.935.\nIt is noted in figure 4(a) that the Friedel phase does not exhibit a clear \u03c0 shift but looks\neven similar to figure 4(b). We expect the Friedel phase to shift by \u03c0 near quasibound states.\n1308 S W Kim et al\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00\n(a) (b)\n(c)\n \n(d)\n\u03b5Fl\n\u03b8F\/\u03c0\n \nFigure 4. Friedel phases as a function of Floquet energy \u03b5Fl for (a) ad = 0.6, (b) ad = 1.0 and\n(c) ad = 0.05 (as = 0). (d ) ad = 0.001 with as = \u22120.2.\nThe absence of a clear \u03c0 shift in figure 4(a) is mainly ascribed to the large overlap between\nthe resonance and the neighbouring domain since the imaginary part of the complex energy of\na pole \u03b5I is quite large, and so is the width of the resonance. Even though \u03b5I is quite small for\nvery small ad , the overlap is still large enough to violate the \u03c0 phase shift by Friedel sum rule\nas shown in figure 4(c). The quasibound state is located quite close to the boundary \u03b5R = 1\nbecause of d\u03b5I\/d\u03b5R|ad=0 = \u221e. If we consider the oscillating potential with an additional\nattractive static potential, however, for very small ad a gap exists between the bound state\nand the domain boundary \u03b5R = 1, which can make the overlap negligibly small, so that the\nphase shift \u03c0 is clearly seen in figure 4(d ). When the Friedel sum rule is applied to the case\nof a multichannel scattering problem, the overlap between the resonance and neighbouring\ndomains should be carefully considered.\n3.4. Wigner delay time\nThe time scales associated with the quantum scattering have been a quite controversial issue\n(see e.g. [32]) because time is not a Hermitian operator in Hilbert space but a parameter.\nNevertheless one can define the global time delay of wave packets by using a Hermitian time\ndelay operator (see e.g. [33]). This time delay operator turns out to be related to the so-called\nWigner\u2013Smith time delay matrix [34], whose trace averaged over different channels gives a\nmeasure of the time delay of the scattered wave caused by the scattering potential (see also\n[35, 36]). The Wigner delay time shows a peak at resonance energies, where the maximal\nvalue of the Wigner delay time approximately corresponds to the decay time h\u00af\/\u03b5I . To obtain\nthe Wigner delay time we use the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix S. Due to the unitarity\nof S, all the eigenvalues lie on the unit circle and can be written in the form ei\u03b8\u03b1 . The Wigner\ndelay time is defined by\n\u03c4W = h\u00af\n\u2211\n\u03b1\nd\u03b8\u03b1\ndE\n|\u3008kn|\u03b8\u03b1\u3009|2 (21)\nwhere the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03b8\u03b1 and an input propagating state (or\nchannel) with momentum kn are denoted by |\u03b8\u03b1\u3009 and |kn\u3009, respectively [37]. It is worth noting\nQuasibound states at thresholds in multichannel impurity scattering 1309\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n0 1 2 3 4\n0\n1\n\u03b5\n\u03c4W  \n \n0 1 2 3 4\n0 .0\n0 .2\n0 .4\n\u03b5\n\u03c4W\n\u03b5R\nad\nFigure 5.

The insets of\nfigure 5 show the Wigner delay time as a function of energy of an incident particle for two ad\nwith as = 0. The peaks of the Wigner delay time are located almost exactly at the real part of\nthe complex energy of the pole in figure 5 (we omitted the data close to the domain boundaries\nwhere the Wigner delay time diverges), under the condition that the pole is located in D0. No\nabrupt change of the Wigner delay time is again observed at the threshold of the transmission\nzero (ad = 0.782). However, the peak disappears close to the domain boundary D\u22121 since\nthe pole enters the next domain.\n4. Delta-function impurity in quasi-1D wire\nAs our second illustrative example, we study the simple quasi-1D scattering problem with an\nattractive static delta-function impurity of strength |\u03b3 |. In [3] it was found that dips in the\ntransmission disappear as |\u03b3 | is increased. Let us again discuss the relation to transmission\npoles.\n4.1. Scattering matrix formulation\nThe Hamiltonian is given by\nH = p\n2\n2\u00b5\n+ \u03b3 \u03b4(x)\u03b4(y \u2212 y0) + Vc(y) (22)\nwhere \u03b3 < 0, and Vc represents a confinement potential which restricts the movement of\nthe particle to the range 0 < y < D in transversal direction. Using the complete set of\nthe transversal modes \u03c7(y) = \u221a2\/D sin(n\u03c0y\/D), the solution of this Hamiltonian can be\nexpressed as\n\u03c8E(x, y) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\ncn(x)\u03c7(y).

The resulting transmission coefficients\nare shown in figure 6.

The\ntransmission coefficient depends on the number of the propagating channels, which will be\ndiscussed in the next subsection.\nQuasibound states at thresholds in multichannel impurity scattering 1311\n4.0 4.1 4.2\n-0.15\n-0.10\n-0.05\n0.00\nD2D1\n2\n0 3 6 9\n1\n2\n3\n4\nE R\n| \u03b3 | (feVcm2)\nE R\nE\nE\nI\nFigure 7.

Quasibound states\nQuasibound states can be obtained from the following equation, derived from Green\u2019s function\napproach [38],\n1\n\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u2211\nn\n4\u00b5\nDh\u00af2\n(\nsin\nn\u03c0\nD\ny0\n)2 1\n2ikn\n= 0 (29)\nwhich has to be solved for energyER \u2212 iEI (entering via equation (7)). It should be mentioned\nthat the location of the quasibound states and the transmission coefficients strongly depend\non the number of modes Nch [38]. In fact they do not converge although Nch is increased.\nIn order to model a realistic impurity one should take Nch large but finite, and fix it for all\nnumerical calculations. Nch = 100 is chosen in this paper.\nFigure 7 shows the trajectory of a quasibound state as \u03b3 is varied. The quasibound state\ncrosses the domain boundary E2 at \u03b3 \u0006 \u22127.11 feV cm2, and enters the next domain D2\n(the open circles in figure 7) on the proper Riemann sheet of the domain D1, (\b,+,+, . . .).\nThe situation is similar to that in section 3 except that the quasibound state collides with the\nreal axis at \u03b3 \u0006 \u22129.06 feV cm2 and only one branch of quasibound states exists. As |\u03b3 |\nincreases the transmission zero moves far away from the pole, as is shown in the inset of\nfigure 7, and finally vanishes when it collides with the other domain boundary E1 at \u03b3 =\n\u22128.83 feV cm2.\nApart from the quasibound state, the attractive delta-function impurity also accommodates\none true bound state below E1. Although the quasibound state vanishes at the threshold value\nof \u03b3 , the true bound state exists regardless of the value of \u03b3 , and its energy monotonically\ndecreases as |\u03b3 | increases.\n1312 S W Kim et al\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n2 4 6 8\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n2 4 6 8\n3.9996 3.9999 4.0002\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n \n(a)\n(b)\u03b8F \/\u03c0\nE\n(c)\n \n(d)\nFigure 8.

Friedel sum rule and Wigner delay time\nThe Friedel phase of the impurity in the quasi-1D wire is shown in figure 8. The \u03c0 phase shift\nby quasibound state is clearly observed for very small |\u03b3 |, but it is hard to be resolved for larger\n|\u03b3 | due to the overlap between the resonance and the neighbouring domain. Figure 9 shows\nQuasibound states at thresholds in multichannel impurity scattering 1313\nthe peaks of Wigner delay time and the real part of the complex energy of the pole, which\ncoincide very well for |\u03b3 | \u0001 5.5 feV cm2. For larger |\u03b3 | it is again difficult to distinguish the\npeaks of the Wigner delay time from the background which diverges at the domain boundary\nE2 (see figure 7). As |\u03b3 | increases the pole first moves away from E2, and then moves back\ntowards E2. The peak of the Wigner delay time originating from the pole strongly overlaps\nwith the divergent part of the background when it changes the direction. Hence, for large |\u03b3 |\nthe position of the peak no longer coincides with the energy of the pole. Friedel phase and\nWigner delay time of the quasi-1D case behave similar to the case of an oscillating impurity.\n5. Summary\nWe have investigated the characteristics of transmission resonances, Friedel phases and Wigner\ndelay times in multichannel scattering problems focusing on the trajectories of quasibound\nstates in the complex energy plane as a scattering strength is changed. Subband thresholds\ndivide the complex energy plane into sub-domains characterized by appropriate boundary\nconditions for the quasibound states. This set of boundary conditions is related to the choice\nof the signs of the complex wave number kn in each subband. A transmission resonance (or\na transmission zero) can vanish when it collides with the subband boundary, which, however,\ndoes not mean that the pole becomes completely irrelevant, as is seen in the transmission line\nshape, the Friedel phase and the delay time. Even if a quasibound state enters the neighbouring\ndomain, it can still effect physics at the real energies of the domain from which it originated.\nWe illustrate these findings with two simple examples: the scattering problem with the 1D\noscillating delta-function impurity and the static delta-function impurity in quasi-1D wire.\nAcknowledgment\nWe would like to thank Ingrid Rotter for a careful reading of our manuscript and helpful\ncomments.\nReferences\n[1] Datta S 1995 Electronic Transport in Mesoscopic Systems (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)\n[2] Datta S, Cahay M and McLennan M 1987 Phys.
