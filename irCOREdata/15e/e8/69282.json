Introduction \n \nIn this paper, I argue that there has been very little focus on issues of structure and \nagency in \u201eclose-up\u201f research into teaching, learning and assessment (TLA) in higher \neducation. The term \u201eteaching, learning and assessment\u201f is used here to refer to the \ninteractions and processes in which academics and students engage in relation to the \ncurricula that make up higher education programmes. The intention is to focus on \nexamining the educational significance of TLA in higher education. There are many \nstudies of aspects of TLA that do not view them as educational processes but rather as \nexamples of processes of other types. For example, Bourdieu and Passeron (1977) and  \nBourdieu et al (1996) see them as processes of legitimation and reproduction of \nexisting social relations. In fact, from their perspective, to see the purposes of \neducation in educational terms represents a misrecognition of their objective \npurposes.  \n \nIt should also be noted that my argument is focused on research into TLA in higher \neducation. There are many studies of TLA in school education that attempt to address \nissues of structure and agency. They date back to the early 1970s, especially those \nfrom the perspective of interactionist ethnography (see Hammersley 1999 for a brief \nhistory of this research in schools). Equally, it should be noted that the research I will \ndiscuss is largely from Europe and Australia. As Tight (2007) notes this research is \nlargely separate from the research in North America. \n \nIn the paper, I first set out, in general terms, what is at stake in debates around \n\u201estructure and agency\u201f before defining my focus on them in relation to TLA in higher \neducation. I illustrate how the absence of considerations of structure and agency in \nwhat might be considered to be the mainstream of research into TLA in higher \neducation limits its explanatory power. Further, I argue that as well as offering more \ncomplete explanations, a consideration of issues of structure and agency also \nhighlights a number of weaknesses in research into TLA in higher education. In \nconclusion, I suggest that an explicit focus on issues of structure and agency can help \nto improve the quality explanations generated through close-up research in TLA in \nhigher education.  \n \n2. What is at stake in structure and agency? \n \nDebates around structure and agency raise a series of very significant questions: How \nmuch are individuals free to decide on their own actions and how much are they \nconstrained by the social settings in which they operate? Are explanations of \neducational phenomena to be found at the micro level of the individual or at the \nmacro societal level? To what extent are educational institutions stable entities or to \nwhat extent can they be changed by the actions of individuals? How much can \neducational theory predict educational practice and how much does practice define \ntheory?  \n \nThese questions give an initial indication of the sorts of issues that are the focus of \nthis paper. In different ways each of these questions relate to the appropriate level at \nwhich educational explanations should be situated. For some, an educational \ninteraction is explained when we have evidence of actors\u201f intentions. For others, it is \nonly explained when we can show how that educational interaction is structured by its \nwider social context.  \n \nSuch issues have been widely discussed in debates around social theory generally (for \nexample Giddens, 1984; Bourdieu; 1992; Archer; 1995; Layder; 1997; Sibeon; 2004). \nIndeed, for some it is the central problem in social explanations (Mouzelis; 1995), \nwhilst other researchers argue that the ability of their conceptual approach to account \nfor both structure and agency is an indicator of its explanatory power (for example see \nByrne; 1998; Flyberg; 2001). However, in the field of research into TLA in higher \neducation these issues are hardly discussed.  My argument in this paper is that \nexplanations of the educational significance of TLA need to focus on both \nindividual\u201fs intentions and on the ways in which these intentions are structured by \ninstitutions and wider social structures. In doing so, my intention is not to spell out a \nfully formed interpretation of how structural and agentic factors impact on TLA \ninteractions in higher education but rather to argue that an explicit consideration of \nthese issues is vital if this research is to develop more complete explanations of such \ninteractions.  \n \nWhilst it is beyond the scope of this paper to offer a complete argument for a \nparticular relation between structure and agency, it is important to give an initial \nindication of how structure and agency are viewed specifically in relation to TLA in \nhigher education. This is because it will have some bearing on my argument for what \nconsidering issues around structure and agency can offer research in this area. My \nintention in thinking about structure and agency in TLA is to try to develop more \ncomplete explanations of these situations. It is not, as is the case in some ethnographic \nstudies, to view these single situations as microcosms that exemplify universal social \nprocesses (see Hammersley, 1992 pp.16-19 for an exposition and critique of this \napproach). From my perspective social structure is part of day-to-day TLA \ninteractions as well as of the categories and concepts that are used to think about them \n(see Zimmerman and Boden, 1991 for a discussion of this view of the relationship \nbetween structure and agency). Thus my interest is in focusing on the ways in which \nthe meanings attributed to particular TLA interactions in higher education by \nparticipants in them (both students and academics) are related to issues of identity, the \ndisciplinary and institutional contexts in which they take place as well as their wider \nsocio-political context.  This is in contrast to approaches which examine aspects of \nstructure and agency by relating different types of studies, those located at a structural \nlevel and those located at the level of social action, as Knight et al do in their study of \nassessment and reporting practices in higher education in this issue, or combining \ndifferent types of data within a single study, as Dibbens (2006) does in relating her \ninterview data to data on her interviewees social class and as Suellen Shay does, in \nthis issue, in her study of assessment as a social practice. \n \nThis means that my focus is on examining particular TLA interactions on the \nassumption that the relation between structure and agency shifts over time and \nbetween situations: that it is situationally contingent. Studying specific incidents can \ngive us a sense of a particular configuration of structural and agentic factors, \nconfigurations that we can compare over time and between situations.  \n \nFinally, in this view of the relationship between structure and agency, structural and \nagentic factor act on what Hymes (1995, p.2) calls the \u201ccognitive unconscious\u201d. That \nis to say, as well as affecting them in ways of which they are conscious, these factors \ncan influence agents in ways of which they are unaware including the categories and \nconcepts that they use to structure their interpretation of particular situations.  Thus an \nindividual\u201fs biography, the institutional setting, the historical moment, and wider \nsocial-political factors can impact on TLA situations in ways that are outside of the \nawareness of academics and students and can also impact on the work researchers in \nstudying TLA . This is a feature of Bourdieu\u201fs (1977) notion of habitus, which offers \na fairly structuralist interpretation of the notion of the cognitive unconscious, in which \nindividuals\u201f perceptions of social fields are structured in ways that are largely \ninvisible to the agents who operate within them. \n  \n3. Some comments on \u2018mainstream\u2019 research into teaching, \nlearning and assessment in higher education from the \nperspective of structure and agency \n \nBy the \u201emainstream\u201f research into TLA in higher education I mean research from the \n\u201eapproaches to learning\u201f perspective. This research has dominated research in this \narea (Webb, 1997; Haggis; 2003; McLean; 2006). It focuses on examining the \nrelations between students\u201f and teacher\u201fs perceptions of their teaching and learning \ncontexts and how these relate to the way in which they approach their teaching and \nlearning activities as well as the outcomes of these activities This perspective has \nconsistently found that variation in students\u201f and academics\u201f perceptions of their \nteaching and learning environment relate to variations in the quality of teaching and \nlearning outcomes(for useful summaries of this research see Prosser and Trigwell, \n1999; Richardson, 2005). \n \nIn examining this approaches to learning research in terms of structure and agency, \nthere are two major problems with the explanations that are offered. First, because \nthis research approach is focused on students\u201f and teachers\u201f perceptions of teaching \nand learning environments, they are firmly rooted in considerations of agency. \nAnything that operates outside of these perceptions is bracketed outside of \nexplanations offered. This is reminiscent of Apple\u201fs (1979) criticism of \nphenomenology that it \u201cinclines us to forget that there are objective institutions and \nstructures \u201eout there\u201f that have power, that control our lives and our very perception\u201d \n(p.140). \n \nSecond, \u201eapproaches to learning\u201f research is only focused on academics and students \nas teachers and learners. It is only those aspects of teaching and learning situations \nthat are directly related to teaching and learning that are considered relevant within \nthese research studies. As a result this perspective focuses on \u201edisembodied\u201f learners \nand teachers and tends to underplay the importance of their identities and power \nrelations in teaching and learning interactions. This means that academics, students \nand their institutional contexts cease to have a history and that the explanatory \nframework is ahistorical. Thus it is unsurprising that, despite the huge changes that \nhave taken place in, for example, the composition of the student body, student: staff \nratios, and the number and type of universities since the approaches to learning \napproach was first developed in the 1970s (for example, see Ashwin, 2006a), its basic \nexplanation of TLA interactions has remained largely unchanged.  \n \nThese problems have led to increasing criticism of this research. So, for example, in \nwork in the area of academic literacies (see Lea and Street, 1998; Jones et al; 1999; \nLillis; 2001) and other research which focuses on teaching and learning as social \npractices (for example see Mann; 2000; Trowler and Cooper; 2002; Jones et al, 2005; \nTrowler, 2005), there has been an emphasis on the importance of the identities and \ninstitutional locations of students and academics in helping to shape teaching and \nlearning interactions. However, most of this research has not been discussed in terms \nof structure and agency.  Whilst there are some notable exceptions to this (Trowler, \n1998; Fanghanel 2004, and in this issue; Shay, 2005; McLean, 2006), none explicitly \ndiscuss what it means to attempt to account for structure and agency in researching \nTLA in higher education. This is a pity because thinking about how we account for \nstructure and agency raises some fundamental conceptual and methodological issues  \nthat, whilst routinely discussed in textbooks on social science methodology (for \nexample Silverman, 2001), are largely ignored in research into TLA in higher \neducation.   \n \nThese issues are related to the relationship between different units of analysis; the \nconceptualisation of the relationship between teaching, learning and assessment; the \nresearch methods that are used; and the accounts of the origins of research questions \nand approaches to data analysis that are given in research into TLA in higher \neducation. These issues are directly related to the initial conceptualisation of structure \nand agency that I outlined earlier. Viewing the relationship between structure and \nagency as situationally contingent raises issues about the relationship between units of \nanalysis and between teaching, learning and assessment; whilst the impact of agentic \nand structural factors on the cognitive unconscious raises issues about the research \nmethods that are used to generate data in TLA research as well as the accounts given \nof the origins of research questions and approaches to data analysis.  In the rest of the \npaper, I examine each of these issues in turn. \n \n4. Some implications for research into TLA of viewing the \nrelationship between structure and agency as situationally \ncontingent \n \n4.1 The relationship between units of analysis in research into \nteaching, learning and assessment in higher education  \nThe focus I outlined earlier on examining particular TLA interactions on the \nassumption that the relation between structure and agency shifts over time and \nbetween situations, raises questions about how the relationship between different units \nof analysis is conceived in research into TLA in higher education. Specifically, it \nsuggests that relationship between different types of units of analysis need also to be \nseen as situationally contingent; as an empirical question that research attempts to \naddress. In this section, I examine the different units of analysis that are used in \nstudying TLA in higher education and, using research into communities of practice in \nTLA in higher education as an example, argue that the relationship between these \ndifferent units of analysis is seldom discussed or problematised in this research.  \n \nIn researching TLA in higher education there are four units of analysis that are \ngenerally focused upon: academics\u201f and students\u201f perceptions; social practices; \ndiscourses; and systems (although it should be noted that some have argued for broad \ncategories of types of disciplinary knowledge as important units of analysis, see \nNeumann, 2001; Neumann, et al 2002). \n \nAcademics\u201f and students\u201f perceptions of TLA in higher education are the focus of the \n\u201eapproaches to learning\u201f research, which has been discussed earlier in this article and \nshown, on its own, to be an insufficient unit of analysis to account for structure and \nagency.   \n Of the other three units of analysis that are focused upon, probably the most fully \nexplored in research into TLA in that of social practices (see Trowler, 2005 for an \nexposition of social practice theory and its problems in relation to teaching and \nlearning in higher education). In undertaking research into TLA as social practices, \nrather than focusing on them as purely pedagogical encounters, one can consider a \nbroad range of factors that impact on the practices that academics and students engage \nwith in TLA situations. This is a level of analysis beyond that of individual because, \nas Bourdieu (1977) argues, the structures of practices are more stable than the \nmeanings agents assign to them.   \n \nA third approach that is taken is to examine discourses in TLA interactions (for \nexample see Boughey and Case and Marshall in this issue; Jones et al, 2005; Peters, \n2005). These are significant in that they are \u201crevealing about the social shaping of \nthought and the local, situational, and pragmatic organisation of conceptual thinking\u201d \n(Edwards, 1993 p.213).  In this way discourses provide an insight into both the social \nand individual aspects of TLA interactions. It is important to be clear that in this \ncontext discourse is taken to be what Bernstein (1990) calls, \u201epedagogic discourses\u201f, \nthe \u201csocial relation of transmission and acquisition\u201d (p.7), and the focus is on how \nthese are constituted in particular TLA interactions. This is as opposed to examining \nhow policy discourses (e.g. Chan, 2005) or wider societal discourses play out in TLA \nsituations (e.g. Archer at al, 2001; Read et al, 2003; Walker, 2004).  \n \nA fourth approach is to see TLA interactions as involving interactions within or \nbetween systems (for example see Fanghanel, 2004; Haggis, 2004). These systems \ncan be seen in a number of ways: in terms of interacting social domains (Layder, \n1997); of interacting activity systems, (Engestr\u00f6m, 2001); or of dynamic systems as in \ncomplexity theory (Fogel et al, 1997; Byrne 1999). These systems contain aspects of \nthe history and biography of academics and students, and their institutional setting, \nwhich help to explain the meaning of the particular TLA interaction.  \n \nIt should be noted that the differences between these accounts is in terms of what is \nplaced in the foreground and background in the analysis rather than researchers \ntreating perceptions, practices, discourses and systems as mutually exclusive \ncategories. For example, in researching communities of practice (see Lave and \nWenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998), some researchers emphasise individuals\u201f perceptions \nof their communities of practice, as Fanghanel does in her paper in this issue. Others \nfocus on the practice element of communities of practice. For example, Tummons\u201f \npaper in this issue looks at the literacy practices that students engage in as part of a \nteaching training course. A third potential focus is on the community, or system, \nelement of the community of practice, as Price (2005) does in her consideration of the \nextent to which module teams in a business school share their tacit knowledge about \nassessment. Finally, others emphasise the discourses that characterise different \ncommunities of practice, as Avis et al (2002) do in their consideration of the \nconstruction of learners in post-compulsory education and training. Each of these \nexamples draw on notions of perceptions, social practices, discourses, and systems but \nin each of these cases a different concept takes centre stage and is taken as the \nprimary unit of analysis.   \n \nThe problem is that the differences between the foci of these studies are rarely \nacknowledged and the assumption seems to be that the relationship between the \ndifferent units of analysis is self evident and unchanging. However, from the \nperspective of structure and agency, this relationship becomes crucial because the \nfocus of the explanation is on how these different factors relate in particular TLA \nsituations. Developing an understanding of the different relationships between \nperceptions, practices, discourses and systems in different TLA contexts in higher \neducation, rather than treating them as apparently self-evident and static categories, is \nvital if explanations of the roles different configurations of these factors play in TLA \nare to be developed.  \n \nThus a focus on the relationship between structure and agency raises questions about \nthe relationship between the different units of analysis used in research into TLA in \nhigher education, questions that are important if higher quality explanations of such \ninteractions are to be developed.  \n \n4.2 The relationship between teaching, learning and assessment in \nhigher education \n \nAs well as raising questions about the relationship between different units of analysis \nin research into TLA in higher education, the assumption that the relationship \nbetween different aspects of TLA situations are situationally contingent also raises \nquestions about the characterisation of the relationship between TLA in such research.  \n \nIn much research in this area, academics and students are treated as if they are \ninvolved in separate processes. In the \u201eapproaches to learning\u201f perspective the \nresearch into students\u201fconceptions and approaches to learning and academics\u201f \nconceptions and approaches to teaching developed at different times and, in \nsummaries of the literature (for example Prosser and Trigwell, 1999; Ramsden, 2003), \nthey are dealt with separately. In the literature on TLA as social practices some \nresearch focuses primarily on the practices of students (for example, Tummons in this \nissue; Lea and Street, 1998; Mann; 2000; Lillis; 2001), whilst others are more \ninterested in the practices of academics (for example, Fanghanel\u201fs and Shay\u201fs paper \nin this issue; Trowler and Cooper, 2002). \n \nThe problem with this separation of the activities of academics and students in TLA is \nthat it can lead to the tacit assumption that, in TLA interactions, the academic teaches \nand assesses while the student learns and is assessed. This problem is most clearly \nillustrated when one focuses on specific academic tasks in which students\u201f and \nacademics are engaged. For example, although students\u201f and academics\u201f accounts of \ntutorials have been generated separately in the \u201eapproaches to learning\u201f literature \n(Ashwin, 2005; Ashwin 2006b), in any one tutorial there are not four separate \nprocesses going on with the tutor engaged in two activities (teaching and assessing) \nand the students engaged in two different activities (learning and being assessed). \nThere is instead a single activity that involves academics and students in different \naspects of teaching, learning, and assessment. An absolutely crucial factor that \nstructures this interaction for both students and academics is the role played by the \nother party. So, in both students\u201f and academics\u201f accounts of tutorials, the role of the \ntutor and students is central to the understanding of what a particular tutorial means \n(Ashwin, 2005; Ashwin, 2006b). Thus the individual agents are not acting alone on \ntheir separate tasks but instead mutually condition each other\u201fs perceptions and \npractices.  \n \nThe separation of the perceptions or social practices of academics from those of \nstudents can also have the effect of over emphasising the degree of agency that they \nhave in determining their action because it takes attention away from the degree to \nwhich the roles of students and academics are structured by the expectations of the \nother and the institutional and cultural norms associated with these roles. (for example \nsee Bourdieu and Passeron, 1977 on the extent to which academics are defined in \ntheir teaching role by their institutional location and Bourdieu et al 1994 on how they \nare defined by the expectations of their students).  \n \nThus thinking about how to account for structure and agency in researching TLA in \nhigher education, highlights the need to have a more contingent conception of how \nteaching, learning and assessment will be related in particular contexts. The \nrelationship between teaching, learning and assessment becomes a question to explore \nin particular interactions rather than a static variable that structures the research. The \nlimited research that has examined how the practices of students and academics relate \nto each other gives a good sense of the contingent nature of this relationship (see \nLindberg-Sand and Olsson in this issue; Mann, 2003; Fejes et al, 2005; Jones et al, \n2005). This research can play an important role in questioning assumptions about how \nteaching, learning and assessment are related in higher education and is important if \nmore sophisticated explanations of these relations are to be developed.  \n \n5. Some implications of the \u2018cognitive unconscious\u2019 on \nresearch into TLA in higher education  \n 5.1 Generating data on teaching, learning and assessment in higher \neducation \nThe notion of the cognitive unconscious outlined earlier has implications for the data \nthat is generated in researching TLA in higher education. In a significant proportion \nof research into TLA in higher education, data are generated based solely on the \naccounts of academics and students, usually through interviews or questionnaires or \nthrough a mixture of the two. This is the case in the \u201eapproaches to learning\u201f \nperspective where most studies either use questionnaires or interviews to generate \ntheir data (see Richardson, 2005 for a useful summary of the instruments used in \ndifferent studies) but it is also true of in research into TLA in higher education from \nother perspectives in that research into TLA as social practices largely focuses on \nacademics\u201f and students\u201f accounts of these practices (for example see Fanghanel in \nthis issue); research into TLA discourses often focus on the discourses that students \nand academics use in talking about TLA (for example Case and Marshall in this \nissue), and research into TLA systems focus on academics and students accounts of \nthese systems (for example, Fanghanel, 2004). The extent of this reliance on students\u201f \nand academics\u201f account is illustrated by Tight\u201fs (2003) analysis of the research \npublished in Higher Education journals in 2000, which suggests that the vast \nmajority\n1\n of empirical studies focusing on teaching and learning, course design, \nstudent experience in higher education (the categories of Tight\u201fs that make up what I \nhave called TLA in this paper) use the accounts of students and\/or academics as the \nsource of their data.    \n \n                                                 \n1\n This is based on combining Tight\u201fs (2003) categories of \u201ephenomenography\u201f, \u201einterviews\u201f and  \n\u201emultivariate\u201f, which all involve the use of data obtained by interviews or questionnaires. \nHowever, if one accepts that social structures and agentic factors can help to shape the \n\u201ecognitive unconscious\u201f, then this sole reliance on the accounts given by academics \nand students becomes extremely problematic. If respondents are not aware of the \nimpact of structural and agentic factors on their experience of TLA interactions then \nthe explanations that are generated from these accounts are likely to significantly \nunderestimate their influence.  \n  \nIn response to this issues, some use the Knight and Saunders (1999) notion of dialogic \ninterviewing to suggest that, through a reflective dialogue with a researcher, \nacademics and students can bring these more structural and agentic factors into their \nconsciousness (for example, see Fanghanel in this issue). However, there are two \nproblems with this approach. First, this reflective dialogue tends to be at a fairly \ngeneral level, taking the research away from a focus on particular TLA interactions. \nSecond, because this reflection is on academics\u201f and students\u201f experiences it seems \npossible that these experiences have already been structured by the \u201ecognitive \nunconscious\u201f in ways that distort the impact of structural and agentic factors on these \nexperiences.  \n \nGiven these problems, it is unsurprising that those who have attempted to research the \nrelations between TLA in higher education have sought to use videos of such \ninteractions (Mann, 2003; Jones et al, 2004) as the basis for reflection by academics \nand students about what is occurring. Such research methods are labour intensive and \nfail to solve all the issues that are attendant in accounting for structure and agency, but \nthey do take the researcher, academics and students closer to actual TLA interactions \nrather than relying solely on academics\u201f and students\u201f accounts of these experiences.  \n Concerns about the unreflective reliance on interview and questionnaire data in social \nscience research are not new of course. For example, Bourdieu (1977, p.120) argues: \n \nsimply by bringing to the level of discourse \u2013 as one must, if one wants to study \nit scientifically \u2013 a practice which owes a number of its properties to the fact that \nit falls short of discourse \u2026 one subjects it to nothing less than a change in \nontological status the more serious in its theoretical consequence because it has \nevery chance of going unnoticed    \n \nHowever, the reason to raise the issue here is that it is not often discussed in relation \nto research into TLA in higher education (a point made very strongly in a review of \nstudies conducted by Kane et al, 2002). Thinking about how one might account for \nstructure and agency in these interactions, at least poses the question of the meaning \nof the data that are generated in this research and the consideration of this question \ncan only contribute to higher quality explanations of TLA in higher education. \n \n5.2 Accounts of the origins of research questions and approaches to \ndata analysis in research into teaching, learning and assessment in \nhigher education \nIf one is to be consistent, then one has to also accept that, as well as impacting on \nparticipants in TLA research, structural and agentic factors will also impact on those \nwho conduct the research. Thus, as there is no reason to believe that  researchers have \nspecial immunity to the unconscious impact of social structures on their work, the \n\u201ecognitive unconscious\u201f will impact on researchers into TLA as well on the academics \nand students who participate in their research. Therefore, if one is to take issues of \nstructure and agency seriously, then one also needs to consider the role that the \nselections of researchers play in shaping the explanations that are generated through \nthe research process. \n  \nIn addition to the selection of research methods that was discussed in the previous \nsection, it is in the selection of their research questions and approaches to data \nanalysis that researchers most obviously shape the explanations that they construct \nthrough their research. Whilst the very idea of a cognitive unconscious suggests that it \nis not possible for individual researchers to have complete knowledge of all the \nstructural and agentic factors that shape these selections, a commitment to accounting \nfor structure and agency demands that one explain these decisions in writing up the \nresearch. However, such accounts are not common in the research into TLA in higher \neducation.  \n \nFirst, in order to be able to form a research question, one needs to have theory that \ngives a sense of the possible relationships between the phenomena under \ninvestigation. As Silverman (2001, p.3) argues \u201cwithout a theory there is nothing to \nresearch\u201d. So from the perspective of structure and agency, in order to understand \nhow the researcher conceptualises their research, one needs to know the theoretical \nperspective that informs their research questions. However, the majority of research \ninto TLA in higher education does not appear to do this.  Tight\u201fs (2004) analysis of \nresearch into teaching and learning, course design and student experience in higher \neducation outside of North America in 2000 suggested that only about a third of the \nstudies showed any engagement with theoretical resources.    \n \nSimilarly, the approach that is taken to the process of turning raw data into analysed \ndata plays a key role in shaping the explanations that are generated through the \nresearch process. The decision to focus on some aspects of the data and not others, as \nwell as the ways in which the data are pooled and categorised, all shape what can be \ngenerated on the basis of those data. However in many research papers in TLA in \nhigher education, through either the decisions of authors or editors, there is little or no \naccount of how data were analysed by the researchers. Whilst, Tight (2000) does not \nprovide figures on this, his finding that only about 40% of the papers he analysed \ngave an explicit account of their data collection methods suggests that a minority of \npapers in this area provide accounts of the approach taken to data analysis. Even \nwhere accounts of approaches to data are given, they are sometimes apparently \nmeaningless statements of the form \u201cthe data were analysed vertically and \nhorizontally, themes emerged and from these categories were generated\u201d. The absence \nof meaningful accounts of the approach taken to data analysis serves to conceal the \nrole that the selections of the researcher have played in generating their findings. This \nsense of concealment is increased in interview studies in which individual quotations \nare used as evidence for a particular interpretation of a TLA interaction without any \nindication being given of how these particular quotations relate to the data set as a \nwhole\n2\n. This can give the impression that researchers have simply looked for aspects \nof their data that \u201ematch\u201f their conceptualisation of what is happening in the TLA \ninteractions being studied and then reported these conceptualisations as the outcomes \nof their research. \n \n                                                 \n2\n Although it should be noted that phenomenographic research, which is part of approaches to learning \nperspective, does relate individual quotations to the overall structure of the data. See Marton and Booth \n1997, \u00c5kerlind 2005, and Ashwin 2006 for a discussion of these issues. \nAt best the absence of reflection by researchers on the theoretical origins of their \nresearch questions and the approach taken to data analysis limits the quality of \nexplanations that are offered because it is not possible to examine the role that these \nselections have played in shaping the explanation that is offered. At worse it can lead \nto tautological research in which the implicit theory underpinning their research of \nTLA in higher education determines the research question and the outcomes of the \nresearch and is then given as the explanation of the aspect of TLA that has been \ninvestigated.   \n \nOnce again, these are problems that are clearly identified in the research methods \nliterature (for example, they are discussed in Silverman\u201fs (2001) \u201eeight reminders\u201f of \nthe potential of qualitative research), but they are seldom addressed in the literature on \nTLA in higher education. Thinking about how to account for structure and agency in \nhigher education throws these issues into sharp relief and provides a focus that can \nhelp to improve the quality of explanations that are generated through this research. \n \n6. Conclusion \n \nIn this paper I have argued that thinking about how to account for structure and \nagency in research into TLA in higher education raises important questions about this \nresearch. First it raises questions about what counts as an explanation in this research. \nSecond, it raises questions about how the relationship between different units of \nanalysis and between teaching, learning and assessment are conceptualised in this \nresearch. Finally, a consideration of how to account for structure and agency raises \nquestions about the meaning of the data that is generated in such research, as well as \nthe role that the selection of research questions and approaches to data analysis play in \nshaping the explanations that can be constructed on the basis this research.  \n \nIn each case, a careful consideration of the implications of issues relating to structure \nand agency has questioned established ways in which research is approached, carried \nout and reported in this field. This suggests that explicit discussions of how structure \nand agency are accounted for in research into TLA in higher education can provide a \nuseful starting point to improve the quality of explanations that are constructed in this \narea of educational research.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nI would like to thank Monica McLean, Paul Trowler, Murray Saunders, Martyn \nHammersley and participants at the Higher Education Close Up 3 Conference, \nLancaster University, July 2006, for some very helpful discussions of the ideas \ncontained in this paper.  \n \nReferences \n \n\u00c5kerlind, G.S.
