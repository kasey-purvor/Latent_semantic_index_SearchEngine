We present a comprehensive new inventory of surge-type glaciers on the Novaya Zemlya\narchipelago, using high-resolution (up to 4m) satellite imagery from 1976\/77 (Hexagon), 1989 (Landsat\nTM), 2001 (Landsat ETM+) and 2006 (ASTER). A total of 692 glaciers and their forelands were observed\nfor glaciological and geomorphological criteria indicative of glacier surging (e.g. looped moraines,\nheavy surface crevassing, surface potholes, thrust-block moraines, concertina eskers). This enabled the\nidentification of 32 potential surge-type glaciers (compared with four previously identified) representing\n4.6% of the total but 18% by glacier area. We assess the characteristics of surge-type glaciers. Surge-\ntype glaciers are statistically different from non-surge-type glaciers in terms of their area, length, surface\nslope, minimum elevation, mid-range elevation and terminus type. They are typically long (median\nlength 18.5 km), large (median area 106.8 km2) outlet glaciers, with relatively low overall surface slopes\n(median slope 1.78) and tend to terminate in water (marine or lacustrine). They are predominantly\ndirected towards and located in the more maritime western region of the Russian Arctic, and we suggest\nthat surge occurrence might be related to large and complex catchment areas that receive increased\ndelivery of precipitation from the Barents Sea.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe sensitivity of glaciers to the climate system means that\nthey provide a visible and measurable indicator of climate\nchange and variability (Lemke and others, 2007). Mountain\nglaciers are receding across the globe and it is widely\naccepted that they are responding to 20th-century climate\nwarming which is very likely due to increased greenhouse\ngas emissions (Pachauri and Reisinger, 2007). This warming\ntrend is thought to be amplified in Arctic regions (Serreze\nand Francis, 2006), where it is becoming increasingly\nimportant to monitor glacier behaviour and their potential\nimpact on sea level (e.g. in Greenland (Howat and others,\n2007), Alaska (Arendt and others, 2002), Arctic Canada\n(Dyurgerov and McCabe, 2006), Svalbard (Hagen and\nothers, 2003) and the Russian High Arctic (Glazovskiy,\n1996; Glazovskiy and Macheret, 2006)).\nThe goal of many of these studies is to measure changes\nin glacier behaviour and determine their coupling to the\nocean\u2013climate system, thereby enabling improved predic-\ntions of their future response. However, glacier response can\nbe complex and is often modulated by a number of factors\nthat are controlled by internal glaciological factors (such as\nsubglacial drainage systems and internal stresses). Surge-\ntype glaciers are particularly widespread in the Arctic, and\ntheir periodic cycle of advance and retreat is not always\ndirectly coupled to climate forcing (Meier and Post, 1969;\nClarke, 1987), although in some cases, surge initiation has\nbeen shown to be related to specific climate and glacier\nmass-balance conditions (Eisen and others, 2001). Identifi-\ncation of surge-type glaciers is of utmost importance when\nattempting to decipher the response of Arctic glaciers to\nclimate change, and the distribution of surge-type glaciers is\nan important constraint when attempting to determine the\ncontrols on their behaviour (e.g. Jiskoot and others, 1998,\n2003). Identification of specific environmental\/glaciological\ncontrols aids development of a better understanding of the\nmechanisms that facilitate fast glacier flow and, where\napplicable, assessment of the likelihood of future surge-\nrelated hazards such as outburst floods (Bruce and others,\n1987; Kamb, 1987).\nWe present a new and comprehensive inventory of surge-\ntype glaciers on the archipelago of Novaya Zemlya, Russian\nHigh Arctic. These islands are situated off the north coast of\nRussia at latitudes 70\u2013778N, and support approximately\n24 400 km2 of ice (Dowdeswell and Williams, 1997).\nAlthough no comprehensive survey of surging has previously\nbeen undertaken, a small number (four) of surge-type\nglaciers have been reported from this location (Dowdeswell\nand Williams, 1997; Sharov, 2005). Here we use a\ntemporally and spatially more comprehensive set of satellite\nimages than previous workers to record both glaciological\n(Copland and others, 2003) and geomorphological (Evans\nand Rea, 2003) criteria of surge-type glaciers and to\nsystematically document their occurrence. Glacier attributes\n(length, area, etc.) are also recorded and we analyse these\nquantitatively in order to assess whether there are statistical\ndifferences between the characteristics of surge- and non-\nsurge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya.\nSTUDY AREA\nNovaya Zemlya lies north of the Russian mainland, between\nthe Barents and Kara Seas, and forms a geological extension\nof the Polar Urals (Fig. 1). The islands are characterized by\nrugged mountain terrain, reaching maximum elevations of\n1340 and 1596ma.s.l. on the main south and north islands\nrespectively (Kotlyakov, 1978). The first glaciological in-\nvestigations on Novaya Zemlya began in the early 20th\ncentury, and many of these findings were later synthesized in\nthe Catalogue of glaciers USSR (Kotlyakov, 1978), which\nJournal of Glaciology, Vol. 55, No. 194, 2009960\nrepresents the most complete study of glaciation on the\nislands and documents data on 685 glaciers.\nGlaciers on Novaya Zemlya are thought to be pre-\ndominantly cold-based (Zeeberg, 1997), and according to\nKotlyakov (1978) there are 67 outlet glaciers radiating from\nthe northern ice cap, 28 ice domes, 560 mountain glaciers\nand 32 glaciers of a type transitional between outlet and\nmountain glaciers. Many of the outlet glaciers from the main\nice cap, on the northern island, terminate in the sea\n(Kotlyakov, 1978), with calving playing an important role\nin glacier mass balance. Further south, numerous valley\nglaciers form part of large icefields and transection glacier\ncomplexes. The majority of these glaciers terminate on land\nor in proglacial lakes, which are impounded by moraines\nthat have formed following retreat from a recent maximum\nwhich has been linked to Little Ice Age (LIA) cooling\n(Zeeberg and Forman, 2001).\nThe substantial inventory in the Catalogue of glaciers\nUSSR (Kotlyakov, 1978) has not been subsequently updated,\nand recent studies have tended to focus on the behaviour of\na few large outlet glaciers, particularly those which emanate\nfrom the main ice cap on the north island (e.g. Zeeberg and\nForman, 2001; Sharov, 2005). The glaciers on Novaya\nZemlya are thought to have reached their maximum LIA\nextent towards the end of the 19th century (Zeeberg and\nothers, 2003) and have since receded at varying rates\n(Zeeberg and Forman, 2001; Sharov, 2005). For a small\nsample (<20) of tidewater glaciers on northernmost Novaya\nZemlya, 75\u2013100% of their net 20th-century retreat had\noccurred by 1952, followed by a slower recession and\/or\nFig. 1.

Sharov\n(2005) reported variable retreat rates of 21 glaciers since\n1952, except for one glacier that advanced and which, it has\nbeen suggested, may be a surge-type glacier.\nThe existence of surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya\nwas first suggested by Koryakin (1974) and Kotlyakov\n(1978). More recently, as part of a larger study (including\nFranz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya), Dowdeswell and\nWilliams (1997) used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)\nimagery to search for surge-type glaciers on Novaya\nZemlya. They used a single scene from 1986 covering\n80% of the glacierized area of the northern island to\nidentify looped medial moraines, potholes on the glacier\nsurface and extensive crevassing, all of which are thought to\nbe indicative of past surge behaviour. Their study revealed\nthat surge features were present on three glaciers, and\nSharov (2005) documented further evidence for surging on\none other glacier on the north island. The Catalogue of\nglaciers USSR (Kotlyakov, 1978) mentioned seven surge-\ntype glaciers, all of which are located south of all the surge-\ntype glaciers found in this study and consist of small valley\nand mountain glaciers. It is unclear on what evidence this\nsuggestion was based, particularly as these glaciers showed\nno signs of surge evidence when checked on imagery used\nin this study.\nCRITERIA FOR IDENTIFICATION OF SURGE-TYPE\nGLACIERS\nAlthough glacier surging is a complex process known to\ncover a broad spectrum of behaviours and characteristics\n(Meier and Post, 1969), a surge-type glacier can generally be\ndescribed as one which undergoes cyclic fluctuations in\nvelocity characterized by two phases: (1) a short (a few\nmonths to a few years) surge\/active phase during which flow\nvelocities increase by at least an order of magnitude and ice\nis rapidly transferred down-glacier, usually resulting in\nadvance of the terminus and thinning of the upper zone;\n(2) a longer (tens to a few hundreds of years) quiescent phase\nwhich occurs between surges, during which ice builds up in\nthe accumulation area and ice nearer the terminus stagnates\nand melts in situ (Copland and others, 2003). Due to the\nshort duration of the surge phase and lack of continuous\nglacier monitoring, few glaciers have been observed\nthroughout the surge cycle. Past surge activity can be\nrecognized, however, from a combination of diagnostic\nglaciological (Copland and others, 2003; Dowdeswell and\nothers, 2007) and geomorphological criteria (Evans and Rea,\n2003; Ottesen and Dowdeswell, 2006; Evans and others,\n2007; Kj\u00e6r and others, 2008; Ottesen and others, 2008).\nThese criteria, listed in Table 1, enable identification of\nsurge-type glaciers irrespective of whether they are actively\nTable 1. Glaciological and geomorphological criteria for identifying surge-type glaciers (from Copland and others, 2003; Evans and Rea,\n2003; Ottesen and Dowdeswell, 2006; Evans and others, 2007; Ottesen and others, 2008)\nCriteria Description\nGlaciological*\n1. Looped moraines Produced when medial moraines are deformed due to the combination of fast- and slow-\nflowing ice within adjacent glaciers\n2. Deformed ice structures Form in a similar manner to looped moraines\n3. Shear margins on the glacier surface Develop at the boundary between fast- and slow-flowing ice\n4. Heavy surface crevassing Indicative of the active phase of the surge cycle and develop due to increased longitudinal\nstresses\n5. High surface velocities Occur during the surge phase\n6. Rapid advance of the glacier terminus Indicative of the active phase of the surge cycle\n7. Highly digitate tidewater terminus Terminus is splayed into lobes by longitudinal crevasses\n8. Strandlines of ice Formed on the adjacent valley sides due to rapid thinning of the upper part of the glacier\n9. Surface potholes Typically appear during the quiescent phase; they form in crevasses formed during the surge\nphase or in depressions between transverse ridges\nGeomorphologicaly\n1. Thrust-block\/push moraines Form as a result of marginal thrusting due to ice advance into proglacial sediments and can\nresult in belts of arcuate thrust ridges. In areas where sediment is limited, low-amplitude push\nmoraines develop\n2. Overridden thrust-block moraines Former thrust blocks are overridden by ice and form ice-moulded \u2018cupola\u2019 hills\n3. Concertina\/zigzag eskers Develop during short-lived, high-discharge flood events which occur just prior to or\nimmediately after surge termination\n4. Crevasse-squeeze ridges Commonly form in response to the highly crevassed glacier. On termination of the surge,\nwater-saturated sediments rise into the basal crevasses and are subsequently preserved in the\nforeground as a series of cross-cutting diamicton ridges\n5. Flutings Can indicate evidence for rapid advance over significant distances but are not solely\ndiagnostic of glacier surging. They often occur in association with crevasse-squeezed ridges\n6. Hummocky moraine Produced in belts at the margin of glaciers and consist of a chaotic landscape with kame and\nkettle topography, which evolves from the thrusting, squeezing and bulldozing of sediments\nand meltout of buried glacier ice (However, other origins are possible)\n7. Ice-cored outwash and glacilacustrine sediments Form in low-lying areas of the glacier snout and may be buried by large outwash fans and\nglacilacustrine sediments. Subsequent modification by meltout of underlying ice leads to a\ntypically pitted, hummocky surface\n*From Copland and others (2003).\nyFrom Evans and Rea (2003); Ottesen and Dowdeswell (2006); Ottesen and others (2008).\nGrant and others: Surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya962\nsurging or not. Moreover, their identification is well suited to\nobservation by satellite imagery, which permits large num-\nbers of glaciers to be inspected very efficiently.\nMETHODS\nAs part of a larger study investigating recent glacier change\nin Novaya Zemlya (to be reported elsewhere), numerous\nsatellite images have been acquired that provide complete\ncoverage of glaciers on the archipelago at various dates over\nthe last four decades. In this study, we use KH-9 \u2018Hexagon\u2019,\nLandsat TM, Landsat Enhanced TM+ (ETM+) and Advanced\nSpaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer\n(ASTER) imagery to identify the features diagnostic of surging\nactivity (Table 1). The spatial and spectral resolution of the\nimagery is detailed in Table 2, and the imagery coverage is\nshown in Figure 1. Images were acquired in July or August,\nwhen snow cover was at a minimum late in the ablation\nseason, thereby enabling more accurate identification of\nsurge-type features. The enhanced spatial and temporal\ncoverage of this study is an advance on that used in previous\nwork (e.g. Dowdeswell and Williams, 1997), and the\nresolution of the imagery (up to 4m) allows subtle geo-\nmorphological features to be identified in the glacier\nforelands (e.g. concertina eskers, thrust-block moraines,\netc.). Additionally, the imagery in this study extends from\n1976 to 2006, with many of the glaciers visible at several\ndates, thus increasing the timescale over which the criteria\nfor surge behaviour may be identified (Fig. 1).\nThe 685 glaciers in the Catalogue of glaciers USSR\n(Kotlyakov, 1978) were incorporated into the World Glacier\nInventory (WGI). Using the latitude\/longitude coordinates\nand other attributes (e.g. aspect, length, area) from the WGI,\nit was possible to confidently identify 522 glaciers from the\nWGI on the satellite imagery. These glaciers are thus referred\nto by their WGI identification number. Unfortunately, the\nremaining 163 glaciers from the WGI could not be located\non the satellite imagery, largely due to an apparent mismatch\nin glacier coordinates. These glaciers, and an additional\nseven glaciers that were not included in the WGI are referred\nto using an ID based upon latitude and longitude, following\nthe Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS)\nprotocol (Raup and others, 2007). Thus, our complete dataset\nconsists of 692 glaciers. Although the smallest glacier in this\ndataset is measured at 0.1 km2, it is likely that other small\nglaciers are missing from the WGI and our dataset. As the\nprobability of surge behaviour is highly correlated with\nglacier length (Clarke, 1991; Jiskoot and others, 1998), it is\nunlikely that any surge-type glaciers are among the small\nglaciers that may have been omitted.\nTable 2.

The glaciers were then categorized\naccording to the following index based on Copland and\nothers (2003):\n1. confirmed surging: active surge phase observed and\nthree or more distinct surge features\n2. likely to have surged: three or more distinct surge\nfeatures, but active phase not observed\n3. possibly surged: less than three surge features present,\nactive phase not observed\n4. non-surge: no surge features present.\nIt is important to note that some of the surge-type features\noutlined in Table 1 can occur on both surge-type and non-\nsurge-type glaciers, so it is the combination of these features\nwhich indicates surging behaviour. Whilst it is relatively\nunusual to observe the active surge phase using satellite\nimagery alone, if a glacier has shown significant advance\n(several hundreds of metres) between two images separated\nlittle temporally (<\u000215 years) and displays three or more\ndistinct surge features on the more recent imagery, then it is\ncategorized as type 1.\nIn addition to the presence\/absence of surge criteria,\nother glacier attributes were recorded in the database (e.g.\nlength, area, elevation, aspect, terminus environment, etc.).\nGlaciers were also classified according to the World Glacier\nMonitoring Service\u2019s protocol (UNESCO\/IAHS, 1970), as\noutlet glaciers, valley glaciers or mountain glaciers. The 522\nglaciers that were successfully matched to the WGI were\ncross-checked and updated for agreement with observations\non our satellite imagery. For the 170 glaciers that were not\nmatched to the WGI, the glacier attribute data were\nmeasured using the satellite imagery. Measuring glacier\nlength and area was occasionally complicated by the\ndifficulty in accurately identifying ice divides, but estimates\nwere possible based on surface flow features and topo-\ngraphic maps at a scale of 1 : 200 000 generated from 1952\naerial photography (contour interval 40m). Potential errors\nin these estimations are deemed insignificant when grouping\nglaciers into relatively large size classes for our analysis (e.g.\nlength classes of 1\u20136 km, 6.1\u201311 km, etc.). Accurate eleva-\ntion data were impossible to measure using satellite imagery\nbut were available for 516 of the 522 glaciers from the WGI.\nAlthough glacier elevations may have changed since their\nmeasurements recorded in the WGI (particularly terminus\nelevations), such changes are likely to be consistent and not\nimportant when comparing surge vs non-surge glacier types.\nRESULTS\nIdentification and distribution of surge-type glaciers\nA total of 692 glaciers were inspected for indications of\nsurge behaviour. The vast majority of these glaciers were of\nnon-surge type, but 32 glaciers (4.6%) showed evidence of\npossible surge activity. Table 3 shows all the glaciers\nidentified as showing signs of surging, with the presence\/\nabsence of different criteria. Of the 32 possible surge-type\nglaciers, 4 were categorized as type 1 (confirmed), 13 as\ntype 2 (likely) and 15 as type 3 (possible). Figure 2 shows an\nexample of a type 1 surging glacier which displays many of\nthe glaciological and geomorphological criteria identified in\nTable 1.\nFig. 2. Glaciological and geomorphological features identified on glacier No. 66, a type 1 surging glacier. (a) 2006 ASTER imagery. The solid\nwhite line represents the extent in 1976, and the dashed white line the extent in 1989, an advance of 600m. Note the presence of looped\nmoraines, extensive crevassing and the digitate nature of the terminus. The white arrows identify the following features: (b) thrust-block and\nhummocky moraines in 1976 \u2018Hexagon\u2019 imagery; (c) hummocky moraine, concertina eskers and crevasse-squeeze ridges in 1976\n\u2018Hexagon\u2019 imagery; (d) deformed ice structures and shear margins in 2006 ASTER imagery.\nGrant and others: Surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya964\nThe 32 potential surge-type glaciers might represent a\nminimum estimate of the number of surge-type glaciers\nsince surge features are not always easy to identify and may\nhave been reworked and removed by subsequent glacio-\nlogical and geomorphological processes (Copland and\nothers, 2003). Conversely, it could be argued that the 15\ntype 3 glaciers (\u2018possibly surged\u2019) do not show convincing\nevidence of surge activity. However, we note that all but\nthree of this class show evidence of looped moraines, which\nare thought to be one of the most robust indications of surge\nactivity in the absence of direct observation (Dowdeswell\nand Williams, 1997; Copland and others, 2003).\nThe location of the 32 potential surge-type glaciers is\nshown in Figure 3, which indicates that they predominantly\noccur on the western margin of the largest ice cap on the\nnorth island, although several also emanate from two\nsmaller icefields to the south. No surge-type glaciers were\nobserved among the valley and mountain glacier systems\nwhich dominate south of \u0002748N, where the maximum\nglacier length is around 12 km.\nCharacteristics of surge-type glaciers\nIn order to investigate the characteristics of surge-type versus\nnon-surge-type glaciers, a number of glacier attributes were\ncompared and statistically analysed. Initially, 57 ice masses\nclassified as glacierets or snowfields were excluded from the\ndataset. This is because it is extremely difficult to determine\nfrom satellite imagery whether such ice bodies still experi-\nence ice movement. Thus, a total of 635 glaciers were\nincluded in the analysis, of which 32 were identified as pos-\nsibly surge-type. For analysis involving elevation data, totals\nof only 462 (mid-range elevation), 463 (maximum elevation)\nand 464 (minimum elevation) glaciers could be used, due to\nmissing data. These included 30 surge-type glaciers. The\npositively skewed distributions of length, area and overall\nsurface slope data were log-transformed prior to analysis.\nAll 32 glaciers with surge evidence are outlet glaciers\nemanating from large ice caps. They are longer, larger and of\nlower slope than most glaciers (Fig. 4; Table 4). All are north\nof 74.258N, have lengths \u00037 km, areas \u000319 km2, height\nranges \u0003350m and gradients <5.48. These 32 glaciers\nTable 3. Surge-type glaciers in Novaya Zemlya.

Allowing for missing data,\nglaciers with surge evidence constitute 9.8% of those 350m\nor more in height range, and 22.2% of those of slope <5.48.\nThe 30 with a full dataset constitute 41% of the glaciers with\nall three size criteria, and 52.6% of those with all six criteria.\nTaking the above subdivision of surge-type glaciers into\naccount, the size effect is even stronger. The shortest type 1\nglacier (confirmed surge) is 23 km, and the shortest type 2\n(likely) is 13 km. The smallest type 1 is 138 km2, and the\nsmallest type 2 is 59 km2.\nGlacier length and glacier area are strongly correlated\n(R2 = 92% for log length with log area), so it follows that\nsurge-type glaciers also have larger surface areas than non-\nsurge-type glaciers. The total area of surge-type glaciers is\n\u00024245 km2, representing \u000218% of the total glacier area\n(estimated at \u000222984 km2 here, compared with 24 400 km2\nby Dowdeswell and Williams, 1997). Overall surface slope\nshows that surge-type glaciers generally have lower surface\nslopes than non-surge-type glaciers (Fig. 4; Table 4). In terms\nof the minimum, maximum and mid-range elevation, non-\nsurge-type glaciers as a group show a greater range than\nsurge-type glaciers, with surge-type glaciers typically reach-\ning lower elevations (Fig. 5; Table 4).\nOne-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to\nestablish whether there were statistically significant differ-\nences between the length, area and elevation characteristics\nof surge vs non-surge glaciers. All potential surge-type\nglaciers (32) were grouped together (i.e. assumed to be\nsurge-type), and results reveal that there are statistically\nsignificant differences between the length, area, overall\nsurface slope, minimum elevation and mid-range elevation,\nbut not maximum elevation (Table 4). Glacier area reveals\nthe strongest relationship (F=188.03; p\u00040.0000), followed\nby length, overall surface slope, minimum elevation and\nmid-range elevation. However, because overall surface\nslope is calculated from the height range and length data,\nthe relation between surface slope and surging is probably\nan indirect effect of the correlation between glacier length\nand surging.\nAlthough all glaciers classified as surge-type are outlet\nglaciers, only 38% of non-surge-type glaciers are outlet\nglaciers; the remainder are classified as either valley or\nmountain glaciers. In order to ascertain any differences\nbetween the surge-type and non-surge-type outlet glaciers,\ntherefore, the same statistical tests were performed on the\noutlet glaciers alone (n=264). These analyses reveal the\nsame statistically significant differences, as do further tests\nconfined to outlet glaciers >6.5 km long (n=117) (Table 4).\nGlacier aspect data reveal that 63% of identified surge-\ntype glaciers face in a westerly direction (northwest, west,\nsouthwest), compared with only 24% of non-surge-type\nglaciers. In contrast, 44% of non-surge-type glaciers face in\nan easterly direction (northeast, east, southeast), compared\nto only 19% of surge-type glaciers. Clearly, surge-type\nglaciers favour westward aspects, with a vector mean of\nFig. 3. Location of surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya. Background images: 1989 and 2001 Landsat imagery and 2006 ASTER imagery.\nGrant and others: Surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya966\n286\u0005 398, whereas other outlet glaciers in the same\nlatitudes have a very weak northward tendency (Fig. 6).\nGlacier terminus types were analysed, with glaciers\nclassified as either terrestrial (terminating on land), marine\n(terminating in the ocean) or lacustrine (terminating in a\nproglacial lake). Termini consisting of a mixture of more\nthan one type were categorized according to that which\ncontacted the greatest breadth of the terminus. The vast\nmajority of non-surge-type glaciers (90%) have terrestrial\ntermini, whereas for surge-type glaciers, marine (41%) and\nlacustrine (28%) termini are more common. A chi-squared\n(\u00022) test indicates that there is a statistically significant\ndifference between the terminus types of surge-type and\nnon-surge-type glaciers at the 99.5% confidence level.\nIn summary, surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya are\npredominantly located in and directed towards the west and\ntend to be larger, longer and exhibit lower surface slopes\ncompared to non-surge-type glaciers. They tend to descend\nto lower elevations and are thus more likely to terminate in a\nmarine (or lacustrine) environment than non-surge-type\nglaciers. Their main distinguishing characteristic is large\narea, >19 km2. As only one non-outlet glacier reaches this\nsize, all surge-type glaciers are outlet glaciers. 54% of the 54\nnon-surge glaciers with areas over 19 km2 are land-\nterminating, compared with only 31% of the 32 surge-type\nglaciers.\nDISCUSSION\nOccurrence of surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya\nPrevious work on Novaya Zemlya suggested that only a\nhandful of surge-type glaciers exist (Kotlyakov, 1978;\nDowdeswell and Williams, 1997; Sharov, 2005). In a similar\nstudy to the one undertaken here, Dowdeswell and Williams\n(1997) found evidence for only three surge-type glaciers.\nThey contrasted this number to the more frequent surge\noccurrence in Svalbard, and suggested that the decrease in\nNovaya Zemlya might be related to the eastward decrease in\ntemperature and precipitation and the increased likelihood\nof glaciers having a cold thermal structure. Various estimates\nhave been given for the percentage of surge-type glaciers in\nSvalbard: 36% in a sample by Hamilton and Dowdeswell\n(1996); 26% of the 504 studied by Jiskoot and others (1998);\nand 13% of the 1029 larger than 1 km2 in area (Jiskoot and\nothers, 1998). However, all these studies omitted glaciers\nsmaller than 1 km2, and had incomplete information for\nTable 4.

This\nincreased detection is likely to reflect the increased spatial\nand temporal resolution of our observations from 1976,\n1989, 2001 and 2006: in their earlier reconnaissance study\nDowdeswell and Williams (1997) used only a single Landsat\nTM scene from 1986, covering only part of the ice on\nNovaya Zemlya. Thus, a significant result of our study is that\nsurge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya are more common\nthan previously recognized.\nTaking into consideration the size of glacier drainage\nbasins, around 18% of the glacier area in Novaya Zemlya is\nsurge-affected. Whilst this estimate is comparable with\nresults from Svalbard (46\u201348% of glacier area; Jiskoot and\nothers, 1998), it is still significantly lower, probably\nreflecting the eastward decrease in precipitation and\ntemperature, as suggested by Dowdeswell and Williams\n(1997). This contrast in precipitation and surging is even\nmore marked between the northwest slope and the southeast\nslope of Novaya Zemlya\u2019s north island. Thus, our new results\nmight imply that warm-based\/polythermal conditions on\nNovaya Zemlya are more widespread than previously\nrecognized and\/or that such conditions have become more\nprevalent in recent years.\nDistribution of surge-type glaciers\nResults indicate that surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya\npredominantly have a westerly aspect and are located in the\nwest of the island (Figs 3 and 6). It is likely that this tendency\nis related to the predominant delivery of precipitation, which\nis 600mma\u20131 greater in the west of Novaya Zemlya than in\nthe east (Glazovsky, 2003). The low precipitation on the\neastern side of Novaya Zemlya is likely to result in glaciers\nwith lower surface mass balance, which are therefore\nunable to build up the mass flux required to generate a\nsurge (Budd, 1975; Clarke and others, 1986). Indeed, we\nnote that potential surge-type glaciers on eastern Novaya\nZemlya are clustered towards the southeast of the northern\nisland, where precipitation is higher than in the northeast.\nIt has also been argued (e.g. Dowdeswell and others,\n1991; Copland and others, 2003) that in regions of relatively\nFig. 5.

Thus, the\nlower accumulation rates on eastern Novaya Zemlya might\nalso result in surge-type glaciers with much longer quiescent\nphases, which make them less likely to be identified.\nThe west-to-east climatic gradient on Novaya Zemlya is\nlikely to be manifested in ice temperature and basal thermal\nregime, which has also been related to surge occurrence\n(Clarke and others, 1986). It has been postulated that there is\na correlation between surging glaciers and a polythermal\nbasal thermal regime (Hamilton and Dowdeswell, 1996;\nJiskoot and others, 2000; Copland and others, 2003). Due to\nthe marked decrease in temperature and precipitation in the\neast of Novaya Zemlya, one might expect the glaciers here\nto be colder, with predominantly cold-based ice limiting\nsurge activity. Other concentrations of surge occurrence\nhave been discovered in East Greenland (Jiskoot and others,\n2003) and Svalbard (Jiskoot and others, 2000), where it has\nbeen suggested that glacier mass balance and surge\noccurrence might be related through topographic controls\nupon mass balance (e.g. topographic shading, snow distri-\nbution and variation in solar radiation), thereby indicating a\npossible indirect local climatic control.\nFinally, subglacial geology is also known to be a possible\nfactor affecting the distribution of surge-type glaciers (e.g.\nPost, 1969; Hamilton and Dowdeswell, 1996; Jiskoot and\nothers 1998, 2000). Early work in North America suggested\na possible link between glacier surging and fault-related\nvalleys where bedrock is likely to be fractured and have a\nhigh permeability (Post, 1969). More recent work in\nSvalbard also found a relationship between glacier surging\nand more erodible and deformable sedimentary bedrock\n(Hamilton and Dowdeswell, 1996; Jiskoot and others,\n2000). These studies (see also Harrison and Post, 2003)\nclearly highlight the potential importance of subglacial\ngeology, particularly the availability of easily deformable\nsediments, in influencing the distribution of surge-type\nglaciers in a number of areas (i.e. Alaska, Yukon Territory\nand Svalbard).\nUnfortunately, knowledge of subglacial geology beneath\nthe glaciers in Novaya Zemlya is limited and it is not\npossible to ascertain the extent of \u2018hard\u2019 vs \u2018soft\u2019 bed\nconditions beneath the surge-type glaciers. The United\nStates Geological Survey (USGS) Circumpolar Geologic\nMap of the Arctic (scale 1 : 6 700000; Persits and Ulmishek,\n2003) provides information on geological age (but not\nlithology) and excludes subglacial areas. However, by\nanalogy with the sediments and landforms observed in\nmany Arctic fjords, from which ice has recently retreated\n(e.g. Ottesen and Dowdeswell, 2006; Ottesen and others,\n2008), it is likely that most of the large tidewater glaciers\nentering fjords are underlain predominantly by deformable\nsedimentary material.\nCharacteristics of surge-type glaciers\nSeveral studies have attempted to identify the characteristics\nof surge-type glaciers in order to better understand the\npossible mechanisms that lead to surge behaviour and, more\ngenerally, fast glacier flow (Clarke, 1991; Jiskoot and others,\n1998). These studies indicate that glacier length is one of the\nmost important factors determining surge \u2018probability\u2019, with\nsurge-type glaciers characteristically much longer, on\naverage, than non-surge-type glaciers (Clarke, 1991; Jiskoot\nand others, 1998). In Svalbard, for example, the median\nlength of surge-type glaciers is 13.1 km, compared to only\n6.5 km for non-surge-type glaciers (Jiskoot and others, 1998).\n(In Jiskoot\u2019s study, the shortest surge-type glacier is 2 km long\nand the smallest is 1.8 km2.) The results from our study\nappear to support this pattern: the median glacier length for\nsurge-type glaciers is 18.5 km compared with only 2.9 km\nfor non-surge-type glaciers (Table 4). However, it should be\nremembered that surges of smaller glaciers may go\nunrecorded because any advance is likely to be much less\nsignificant than for larger glaciers (Clarke and others, 1986;\nHamilton and Dowdeswell, 1996). Furthermore, many of\nthe criteria used to identify surge-type glaciers are likely to\nbe easier to detect on large glaciers, especially on satellite\nimagery. We also note that, in contrast to previous studies\n(e.g. Jiskoot and others, 1998), the statistical difference\nbetween surge- and non-surge-type glaciers was greatest for\narea, rather than length, although the two are strongly\ncorrelated with each other.\nIn addition to length and area relationships, surge-type\nglaciers are often associated with lower ice surface slopes\ncompared with non-surge-type glaciers (e.g. Clarke, 1991;\nBjo\u00a8rnsson and others, 2003; Jiskoot and others, 2003).\nMedian slopes reported by Jiskoot and others (1998) were\n3.18 for surge-type and 5.18 for other glaciers, but the\nsteepest surge-type glacier was 148, much steeper than in\nNovaya Zemlya. Our analysis of the surge-type glaciers on\nNovaya Zemlya supports the association of surging with\ngentler slopes (Fig. 4; Table 4), but it is important to note that\nsurface slope is strongly linked to glacier length (Clarke,\n1991). Our partial correlations suggest no association with\nslope or length beyond that accounted for by area.\nIt has also been reported that surge-type glaciers in some\nareas occupy higher overall elevations (Clarke and others,\n1986) and cover greater elevation ranges (Jiskoot and others,\n1998) than non-surge-type glaciers. However, our results\nshow that surge-type glaciers have typically lower minimum\nand mid-range elevations than non-surge-type glaciers. This\nprobably reflects the generally lower elevations on Novaya\nZemyla and its large plateau ice cap, compared with other\nstudy areas. Furthermore, our dataset of 692 glaciers\nincludes many smaller mountain and cirque glaciers located\nat high elevations in the south (mid-altitude up to 1050m),\nwhereas the majority of surge-type glaciers terminate at sea\nlevel and emanate from the large plateau ice cap in the\nnorth.\nThere are 27 non-surge-type (type 4) glaciers with the six\ncriteria shared by all surge-type glaciers (gently sloping\noutlet glaciers north of 74.258N, large on three size criteria).\nThese merit further investigation for possible surging. The six\ncriteria do not include aspect since 5 surge-type glaciers\nface southeast, or terminus since 10 surge-type glaciers are\nland-terminating. The proportion that is land-terminating is\nsimilar for surge-type glaciers and for these others. However,\nof the 57 glaciers with all six criteria (27 non-surge-type and\n30 surge-type glaciers), 36 have aspects of southwest, west,\nnorthwest or north: of these, 23 (64%) are surge-type.\nBeyond that, there may be currently unknown differences in\nsubglacial topography that may inhibit surging in the other\nglaciers. Alternatively, the differences may be in the\nsubglacial material. On the other hand, some of these\nglaciers may eventually surge.\nGrant and others: Surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya 969\nFinally, all surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya are\noutlet glaciers within larger ice bodies (ice caps or icefields).\nThis pattern is reflected across the Arctic where many surge-\ntype glaciers are outlet glaciers, often terminating in the sea\n(Copland and others, 2003; Ottesen and others, 2008).\nSimilarly, almost all surge-type glaciers in Iceland are outlets\nfrom larger ice bodies (Bjo\u00a8rnsson and others, 2003). On\nNovaya Zemlya, however, restriction to outlet glaciers may\narise simply from glacier size. One hundred and sixteen\noutlet glaciers are \u00037 km long, but only three other glaciers\nare \u00037 km long; five are 7 km long and none are longer than\n11 km.\nBy their very nature, outlet glaciers and large\/long\nglaciers often involve more complex flow than shorter\nvalley or mountain glaciers which terminate on land. A\nrelationship between glacier surging and complexity (com-\nplex flow and flow obstruction due to topographic controls)\nhas been presented by Jiskoot and others (2000), and\nalthough this parameter was not measured in our study, we\nspeculate that a similar relationship exists, because surging\nis more common in outlet glaciers with low surface slopes\nand large and complex catchment areas.\nSurge mechanism\nThe inter-relationships between glacier surging, glacier\nlength and area, and glacier surface slope have been linked\nto subglacial conditions and the mechanism of surging (e.g.\nClarke, 1991; Jiskoot and others, 2000). The greater length\nand lower surface slopes are thought to be more conducive\nto a \u2018linked-cavity surge mechanism\u2019 (Kamb, 1987), where-\nby the organization of the subglacial drainage system\nimpedes efficient evacuation of water, increasing basal\nwater pressures and resulting in enhanced basal sliding\nduring the surge phase. It has been pointed out, for\nexample, that longer glaciers are more likely to encounter\nimpeded subglacial drainage and that water is more likely\nto be stored under lower ice surface slopes (Clarke and\nothers, 1986).\nOther workers propose that glacier length is linked to\nsurge behaviour because there is an increased probability of\nlonger glaciers: (i) being thicker and able to store more water\n(e.g. Lingle and Fatland, 2003); (ii) overlying fine-grained\ntills (due to increased transport distances under the glacier)\n(Jiskoot and others, 2000); and (iii) experiencing a distance-\nrelated decrease in longitudinal stress (Jiskoot and others,\n2000). It should be remembered also that glacier length\ncould be a proxy for other attributes related to surge\ninitiation such as ice thickness or mass (Clarke and others,\n1986). Moreover, where surge occurrence has been found\nwith steeper ice surface gradients and\/or where soft\nunconsolidated sediments underlie the glacier, the \u2018linked-\ncavity mechanism\u2019 is unlikely to occur, and others have\nproposed a mechanism related to switches in the basal\nthermal regime (e.g. Jiskoot and others, 2000). Indeed, as\ndiscussed earlier, the availability of soft fine-grained sedi-\nments has been linked to increased surge activity (Jiskoot\nand others, 1998, 2000; Harrison and Post, 2003; Ottesen\nand others, 2008). Whilst the greater length and low surface\nslopes of surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya might\nfavour a \u2018linked-cavity mechanism\u2019 over hard bedrock, the\nsubglacial geology on Novaya Zemlya is largely unknown. It\nis equally plausible therefore, and arguably more likely in\nfjord settings (Ottesen and Dowdeswell, 2006; Ottesen and\nothers, 2008), that mobilization of unconsolidated material\nat the glacier bed could be a significant factor in influencing\nsurge behaviour. Improved knowledge of subglacial geology\non Novaya Zemlya and its potential influence on glacier\nsurging is an area that future work could address. More\ngenerally, there is also a clear need for an improved\nunderstanding of the interplay between subglacial till and\nthe internal hydraulic system, which appears to be crucial to\nunderstanding the mechanisms of glacier surging (Harrison\nand Post, 2003)\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Novaya Zemlya archipelago supports \u000222 984 km2 of\nice, the majority of which forms a large ice cap on the north\nisland. Over 690 glaciers have been documented in this\nregion (Kotlyakov, 1978), but previous work suggested that\nthese include only a small number of surge-type glaciers\n(four) (Dowdeswell and Williams, 1997; Sharov, 2005),\ndespite the widespread occurrence of surging in other Arctic\nregions such as Svalbard and Greenland. We have used a\nvariety of high-resolution satellite images from different\ndates to record the presence of glaciological (Copland and\nothers, 2003) and geomorphological (Evans and Rea, 2003)\ncriteria identifying surge-type glaciers, and to systematically\ndocument their occurrence.\nA total of 32 potential surge-type glaciers are identified,\nwhich represent 4.6% of the total glacier population but\n18% of the total glacier area (cf. 46\u201348% of area for\nSvalbard; Jiskoot and others, 1998). This increased detec-\ntion, compared with previous studies, is likely to reflect the\nincreased temporal (1976, 1989, 2001, 2006) and spatial\n(up to 4m) resolution of our satellite observations and\nimplies that warm-based or polythermal conditions may be\nmore widespread on Novaya Zemlya than previously\nrecognized. In fact we expect warm-based conditions in\ndeep outlet glaciers of the northwest coast, which are fed by\nconsiderable snowfalls.\nSurge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya predominantly\nexhibit a westerly aspect and are located in the west of the\nisland. They tend to be longer and larger, and exhibit lower\nsurface slopes, than non-surge-type glaciers. They also tend\nto descend to lower elevations and are more likely to\nterminate in a marine or lacustrine environment than non-\nsurge-type glaciers. Statistically significant differences are\nfound between surge-type and non-surge-type glaciers in\nterms of their area, length, overall surface slope, aspect,\nminimum elevation and mid-range elevation. They are also\nstatistically different in terms of their terminus type, which\nfavours a marine or lacustrine setting.\nIt is suggested that surge occurrence might be related to\nlarge and complex catchment areas found in the more\nmaritime west, which receives increased delivery of precipi-\ntation from the Barents Sea. This implies that precipitation,\nin addition to glacier length or surface slope, is an important\ncontrol on surge-type glaciers in this region.\nNumerous studies have linked recent glacier retreat to\nclimate change in the Arctic (e.g. Hagen and others, 2003;\nHowat and others, 2007), where warming is expected to be\namplified (Serreze and Francis, 2006). The periodic cycle of\nadvance and retreat of surge-type glaciers is not directly\ncoupled to climate forcing, and the discovery of previously\nunidentified surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya under-\nlines the importance of investigating surge behaviour in\nthese regions.\nGrant and others: Surge-type glaciers on Novaya Zemlya970\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was funded by a Reading University Research\nEndowment Fund studentship awarded to K.
