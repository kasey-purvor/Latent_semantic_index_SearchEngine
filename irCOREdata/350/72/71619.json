The results show that the effusion rate is an important \ncontrol on the eruption style, with explosive eruptions favoured by large \neffusion rates.  \nThe models are used to explain contrasting eruption mechanisms during \nvarious Quaternary subglacial rhyolite eruptions at Torfaj\u00f6kull, Iceland. \nAlthough the models are simplistic, they are first attempts to unravel the \ncomplex feedbacks between subglacial eruption mechanisms and glacier \nresponse that can lead to a variety of eruptive scenarios and associated \nhazards. \n \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 3 \nIntroduction  \nThe initial phases of subglacial eruptions occur within cavities melted into \nthe glacier base by magmatic heat (e.g. H\u00f6skuldsson and Sparks, 1997; \nWilson and Head, 2002; Gu\u00f0mundsson, 2003). The eruptive behaviour \ninvolves interaction between rising magma and meltwater, which may lead \nto the formation of pillow lavas, quench-hyaloclastite or phreatomagmatic \ntephra, depending upon the mechanism of magma-water interaction (e.g. \nMoore and others, 1995; Smellie and Hole, 1997; Tuffen and others, 2001).  \nStudies of subaqueous volcanism have shown that the mechanism of \nmagma-water interaction depends upon the confining pressure (e.g. Moore \nand Schilling, 1973), magma-water ratio (Wohletz, 1983), magma volatile \ncontent (McBirney, 1963; Dixon and others, 1995, Wright and others ) and \nthe ability of magma and water to mix (e.g. Zimanowski and others, 1997). \nSimilarly, the mechanisms of subglacial eruptions are controlled by the \ncavity conditions such as confining pressure and abundance of meltwater \n(Tuffen, 2001; Kelman and others, 2002; Wilson and Head, 2002; \nH\u00f6skuldsson and others, 2006). These conditions may change very rapidly, \neven in non-volcanic areas (e.g. Kavanaugh and Clarke, 2000) and are \ndetermined by patterns of melting, ice deformation and meltwater drainage \n(e.g. Hooke, 1984; Bj\u00f6rnsson, 1988). Since the melting rate during \nsubglacial eruptions is itself determined by the eruption mechanisms (e.g. \nGu\u00f0mundsson, 2003), the eruption mechanism will in turn influence cavity \nconditions, and the volcano-ice system is coupled (Tuffen and others, \n2001). The models presented here constitute a first attempt to simulate the \nbehaviour of this coupled system. \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 4 \n  \nExisting models of subglacial eruption mechanisms  \nMany useful insights have come from recent models of subglacial eruption \nmechanisms. H\u00f6skuldsson and Sparks (1997) considered pressure changes \nduring effusive eruptions within isolated cavities, from which meltwater \ncannot escape (closed system). Their calculations showed that the system \nvolume will inevitably increase during effusion of rhyolitic magma, as the \nvolume of ice melted cannot is insufficient to accommodate the erupted \nmagma. Volume increases were also predicted to occur during effusive \nbasaltic eruptions, unless energy transfer were highly efficient (>80 %) and \nthe magma were vesicle-poor. The results were used to argue that \nmeltwater may accumulate at the vent during some basaltic eruptions, but \ncannot do so during any rhyolitic eruption, as an increase in volume will \nlead to increased pressure that will drive meltwater away from the vent \narea.  \nTuffen and others (2002a) modelled localised melting of a glacier base \nduring an intrusive rhyolite eruption. The competing effects of melting and \ninward ice deformation on the evolving size of the cavity were modelled \nusing Nye\u2019s law (Nye, 1953). Tuffen and others assumed that melting \noccurs evenly over the roof of a hemispherical cavity and that heat loss \nfrom magma was the rate-limiting step in the transfer of thermal energy \nfrom magma to ice, rather than the melting process itself. The validity of \nthe latter assumption is brought into question by observations of the Gj\u00e1lp \neruption, as heated meltwater may have left the vent area (Gu\u00f0mundsson \nand others, 2004).  \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 5 \nWilson and Head (2002) provided a novel approach to the mechanisms \nof subglacial basaltic eruptions, suggesting that dykes may propagate into \nthe glacier base, melting narrow, blade-like cavities, and that the early \nstages of eruptions may be regarded as the intrusion of sills at the ice-\nbedrock interface. The dykes would collapse once the supporting ice was \nmelted away.  \n \nThe influence of confining pressure on subglacial eruption mechanisms  \nSubglacial basaltic tuyas typically consist of basal pillow lavas overlain by \nincreasingly vesicular hydroclastic tephra (e.g. Smellie, 2000), indicating \nthat the mechanism of magma-water interaction changes during edifice \ngrowth as the confining pressure decreases. In general, pillow lavas \ngenerally form beneath ice \u2265 500 m thick and hydroclastic tephras beneath \nthinner ice (e.g. Moore and others, 1995), but there are exceptions to this \nrule, as other factors such as the magma volatile content, effusion rate and \nmagma-water ratio are also important (e.g. McBirney, 1963; Wright and \nothers, 2003; Griffiths and Fink, 1992; Wohletz, 1983). Explosive activity \nmay also occur under thicker ice if subglacial pressures are less than \nglaciostatic (Wilson and Head, 2002; Schopka and others, 2006).  \nIn contrast, there is no obvious relationship between stratigraphic \nposition and facies type for the subglacial phase of rhyolite tuya-building \neruptions. Eruptions appear to be either dominantly explosive, generating \nphreatomagmatic tephra, or intrusive, with the emplacement of quench \nhyaloclastite (Tuffen and others, 2001; Tuffen and others, 2002b; \nStevenson, 2005). It thus appears that factors other than confining pressure \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 6 \nare of predominant importance during rhyolitic eruptions, most probably \nthe effusion rate and magma volatile content. \n  \nCavity pressure, meltwater drainage and ice deformation \nH\u00f6skuldsson and Sparks (1997) showed that cavity pressure in a closed \nsystem may be less than glaciostatic (with the difference here defined as \nthe underpressure) if magma-ice energy transfer is highly efficient. \nAlthough such efficiency may seldom occur in real systems \n(Gu\u00f0mundsson, 2003), underpressures may nonetheless develop if \nhydraulic connectivity with low-pressure cavities is established and \nmeltwater drainage occurs (e.g. Wilson and Head, 2002; Schopka and \nothers, 2006). Indeed, there is increasing evidence that meltwater can drain \nsubglacially at the onset of most subglacial eruptions (e.g. Tuffen and \nothers, 2001; Gu\u00f0mundsson and others, 2004).  \nCavity underpressures depend on aspects of the local hydrology such \nas tunnel length, meltwater flux and temperature (e.g. Hooke, 1984). \nUnderpressure leads to inward roof deformation, which will be ductile if \ncavity radius << ice thickness. The deformation rate for cylindrical or \nspherical cavities is given by Nye\u2019s law (Nye, 1953). Roof closure leads to \ndepression of the ice surface above, forming an ice cauldron. As the cavity \nsize increases, the ice eventually fails brittly, typically once the cauldron is \n\u226550 m deep (as observed in Iceland - e.g. Gu\u00f0mundsson and others, 1997). \nThe depth of brittle failure then increases as the cavity grows until the \ncavity roof fails and a subaerial eruption commences (Gu\u00f0mundsson and \nothers, 1997; 2004).  \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 7 \n \nEvidence from the 1996 Gj\u00e1lp eruption and models of Gu\u00f0mundsson \nObservations and models of the 1996 Gj\u00e1lp eruption, as described in \nGu\u00f0mundsson (2003) and Gu\u00f0mundsson and others (1997; 2002; 2004) \nhave provided important new constraints on many aspects of magma-ice \ninteraction. The following information is useful for the models presented \nhere: (1) Deformation of the 450-650 m thick ice above the eruption site \nwas initially ductile. (2) Although meltwater drained from the eruption site, \na column of meltwater accumulated above the edifice. (3) The well-drained \nsubglacial cavity above the southern part of the fissure had an \nunderpressure of about 2 MPa. (4) The heat transfer efficiency between \nmagma and ice at the eruption site, fi, was between 0.55 and 0.66. (5) Less \nthan 10 % of the erupted products were washed away by meltwater. 6) The \nheat flux during the eruption was 100 times that during slow cooling of the \nGj\u00e1lp edifice.  \n \nOutline of the model \nThis paper employs a simple model of the volcano-ice system to explore \nthe effects of various parameters on eruption mechanisms. It considers \nrhyolitic eruptions as point sources at the base of horizontal ice sheets with \nconstant effusion rates. It is assumed that the feeder dyke does not \novershoot the bedrock-ice interface (c.f. Wilson and Head, 2002). \nMagmatic heating causes melting of ice, forming a hemispherical cavity at \nthe glacier base (Fig. 1). The cavity roof closes by ductile deformation, \napproximated by Nye\u2019s law, at a rate determined by the cavity size and \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 8 \nunderpressure. The cavity size is determined by the relative rates of \nenlargement by melting and closure by ice deformation. Meanwhile, a \nvolcanic edifice accumulates within the cavity (Fig. 1). Although meltwater \nis assumed to escape from the cavity, any gap above the edifice will be \nfilled with water and steam (Fig. 1a). The model predicts the evolving sizes \nof the cavity and the edifice together with the depth of water\/steam above \nthe edifice and the depth of the ice cauldron (Fig. 2). A range of ice \nthicknesses, effusion rates and magma vesicularities is employed. Table 1 \nlists the variables and constants used.  \n \nHeat transfer from magma to ice \nThe thermal energy released per unit volume of rhyolitic magma during \ncooling and quenching E is given by  \n \nwhere \u03b8 denotes magma vesicularity, \u03c1l the unvesiculated magma density, \ncl magma heat capacity and \u2206Tl the temperature change of the magma \n(H\u00f6skuldsson and Sparks 1997). This assumes that (1) the deposits are \nglassy, which is appropriate for the vast majority of subglacial rhyolites \nstudied, so that latent heat of crystallisation can be ignored, and (2) the heat \ncapacity of gases within vesicles is negligible.  \n \nMechanisms and efficiency of heat transfer  \nOnly heat released rapidly from the magma is considered (within seconds \nor minutes of its emplacement); later edifice cooling is ignored. The heat \nlll TcE \u2206\u2212= \u03c1\u03b8 )1( (1) \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 9 \ntransfer efficiency fi is the fraction of heat transferred instantaneously to \nmelt the ice (Gu\u00f0mundsson and others, 2004). Therefore, the heat flux for \nice melting, Qm, is equal to  \n \nitlm EfQQ )(=  \n \nwhere Ql(t) is the instantaneous effusion rate and E is the total thermal \nenergy of the magma as before. The heat transfer efficiencies for two \npossible eruption mechanisms are considered. During a) phreatomagmatic \nfragmentation, heat loss from magma is rapid, due to the large surface area \nfor heat exchange (Zimanowski and others, 1997). Heat loss models and \nobservations from Gj\u00e1lp suggest that fi may range between 0.55 and 0.66 \n(Gu\u00f0mundsson, 2003), but for simplicity and because these models are \nonly approximate, a value of 1 will be used for these models. During b) \nintrusive eruptions, rising magma is quenched by meltwater within the \nslowly cooling edifice (Tuffen and others, 2002a). The heat transfer rate is \nmuch smaller than during phreatomagmatic fragmentation and is similar to \nthat from a newly-erupted edifice. As the heat flux from the Gj\u00e1lp edifice \nimmediately after the eruption was approximately 5-10 % that during it \n(Gu\u00f0mundsson and others, 2004), fi is estimated to be 0.1. \n \nMelting of ice \nMagmatic heat may cause melting of ice and also heating and vaporisation \nof the meltwater formed. Although meltwater temperatures may be 20 \u00b0C \nor more (Gu\u00f0mundsson and others, 1997), for simplicity meltwater will be \n(2) \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 10\nassumed to be at 0 \u00b0C. The fraction of heat converted to kinetic energy \nduring phreatomagmatic explosions is likely to be small (Wohletz, 1983) \nand will be ignored. The volume of ice melted per unit volume of magma vi \nis thus given by \n \nwhere \u03c1i and Li are the density and heat of fusion of ice, respectively. \nIt is assumed that melting occurs evenly over the roof of a hemispherical \ncavity of radius R. The melt-back rate r'm is thus given by  \n \nwhere vi is the volume of ice melted per unit volume of magma and Ql is \nthe effusion rate. \n \nIce deformation \nAccording to Nye\u2019s law, the roof of a hemispherical cavity within an \ninfinite ice sheet will deform at a rate r'd given by  \n \nwhere \u2206P is the cavity underpressure, n is Glen's flow law constant (\u22483) \nand B is an ice deformation parameter, taken as 5.3 \u00d7 107 Pa s1\/3 (e.g. \nHooke, 1984). Nye\u2019s law applies when the cavity radius is small compared \nwith the ice thickness (Nye, 1953), but breaks down at large cavity sizes. \n[ ])1(Tc\nL\nf\nv lll\nii\ni\ni \u03b8\u2212\u2206\u03c1\u03c1\n=\n(4) ,2' 2R\nQv\nr lim\npi\n=\nn\nd\nnB\nPRr \u0001\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\u0005\n\u0006\u2206\n=\n'\n \n(5) \n(3) \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 11\nThe simulations have been run until the ice roof is less than 50 m thick, \nwhen it is assumed to fail. The results will therefore only be approximate at \nlarge cavity sizes, once Nye\u2019s law begins to break down.  \nIce will flow horizontally into the ice cauldron, as its surface seeks to \nregain an equilibrium shape (A\u00f0algeirsd\u00f3ttir and others, 2000). At Gj\u00e1lp, \ndeformation speeds were approximately 10-5-10-6 m s-1, meaning that \nsubstantial changes in the surface profile would require years. To illustrate \nthis, at a reasonable range of effusion rates of 1 - 100 m3 s-1 for silicic \ndome-building eruptions and 103 \u2013 106 m3 s-1 for plinian eruptions (Pyle \n2000), we find that a 500 m-high hemispherical edifice would be \nconstructed in months to years during a dome-type eruption and hours to \ndays in plinian eruptions. This suggests that horizontal closure beneath ice \nthicknesses of the order of 500 m may only be significant during prolonged \neruptions with small effusion rates. Nonetheless, two end member \nscenarios are envisaged in the models: one in which no horizontal ice \ndeformation occurs, the other where closure is so rapid that the surface \nremains horizontal at all times (here termed \u2018perfect horizontal \ndeformation\u2019).  \n \nCavity pressure and roof closure \nFor the purposes of this study, cavities are assumed to be at atmospheric \npressure due to meltwater drainage and the establishment of a hydraulic \nconnection with low-pressure cavities. Although this may be unrealistic for \nsome eruptions, it avoids the difficulty of estimating cavity pressures, \nwhich depend on so many aspects of the local hydrology and the melting \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 12\nprocess. A justification for this assumption is that many rhyolitic eruptions \noccur at central volcanoes with powerful geothermal systems (e.g. \nTorfaj\u00f6kull, Krafla and Kerlingarfj\u00f6ll). There is therefore likely to be a \nhigh geothermal heat flux in the vicinity of the vent directly preceding the \neruption, which would favour the development of low-pressure cavities, as \nfound in the firn-filled crater of Mount Rainier where there is a strong \ngeothermal field (Kiver and Steele, 1975). The rates of ice deformation \npredicted by the model are therefore maximum rates. Models exploring the \neffects of different cavity pressures on the mechanisms of subglacial \neruptions will be presented elsewhere.  \nThe glaciostatic pressure at the cavity roof at time t, Pg (t) is given by \n \nwhere hr(t) is the ice roof thickness at time t, which is expressed as \n \n \nwhere h\u03bf is the initial ice thickness and r'm is the melt-back rate given in \n(4). The pressure driving deformation of the cavity roof, \u2206P(t) is given by \n \nwhere Pc is the cavity pressure, assumed to be 0.1 MPa in these \nsimulations. Note that when there is no horizontal deformation, the roof \nwill progressively thin during the eruption, reducing the weight of the ice \nroof and leading to slower rates of closure. \n)()( tritg ghP \u03c1=\ndtrhdtrRhh\nt\ntm\nt\ntdttr \u0007\u2212=\u0007\u2212\u2212=\n0\n)(\n0\n)()()( '' \u0001\u0001\n(6) \n(7) \nc\nt\ntmictrit PdtrhgPghP \u2212\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u0007\u2212=\u2212=\u2206\n0\n)()()( '\u0001\u03c1\u03c1 (8) \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 13\n \nCavity size balance \nThe cavity size is determined by the relative rates of enlargement by \nmelting and closure by deformation.

This \nallows potentially explosive magma-water interaction to occur (Figs. 1a, \n2a). The development of convection cells in the water may assist transfer of \nheat from fragmenting magma to ice, leading to rapid melting.  \n  \nB. Edifice fills cavity \nIf the edifice fills the cavity, rising magma cannot interact with a column of \nwater (Figs. 1b, 2b). Instead, it is likely to intrude and be quenched within \nthe poorly-consolidated, waterlogged edifice. This may generate facies \nsimilar to pumiceous peperites (Hunns and McPhie, 1999; Tuffen and \nothers, 2001), where the explosivity of magma-water interaction is \nsuppressed by the surrounding fragmental material, despite the magma \nbeing volatile-rich. A small proportion of the magma may reach the glacier \nbase, where it may generated small ice caves through localised melting \n(Tuffen and others, 2002a), or intrude as a sill at the bedrock-ice interface \n(Wilson and Head, 2002).  \n \nResults of the models \nThe model calculates the radii of the growing edifice and evolving \nsubglacial cavity, together with the ice surface elevation. Fig. 2 shows \ntypical graphs produced using the model, for two values of effusion rate \nbeneath ice 450 m thick. Deformation is insignificant when the effusion \nrate is large (Fig. 2a) and a considerable water-or steam-filled gap develops \nabove the edifice. At small effusion rates, ice deformation is much more \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 16\nimportant (Fig. 2b) and the edifice soon completely fills the cavity. Once \ncavities become filled, it is assumed that eruptions will remain intrusive as \nthe heat flux to the glacier is greatly reduced. The evolving ratio of edifice \nradius to cavity radius for a range of effusion rates is given in Fig. 3a, \nillustrating how cavities become filled at small effusion rates but a \nconsiderable meltwater\/steam-filled gap develops at large effusion rates. \nThe effects of magma vesicularity are shown in Fig. 3b. If all other \nparameters are unchanged, increasing the magma vesicularity can lead to \nthe cavity becoming filled at intermediate effusion rates. This is due to the \nsmaller amount of heat per unit volume carried by highly vesicular magma.  \n \nWill eruptions be explosive or intrusive? \nSolutions were found for the critical effusion rate Qcr for a given ice \nthickness and with either no or perfect horizontal ice deformation. At rates \nless than Qcr, the cavity becomes completely filled by the edifice, which is \nlikely to lead to an intrusive eruption mechanism. Above Qcr, the edifice \nnever completely fills the cavity, and the eruption has the capacity to \nremain explosive until it becomes subaerial. This process was repeated for \na range of ice thicknesses, and the results plotted on Fig. 4. Intrusive \neruptions are favoured by thick ice and small Ql. In addition to the main \npart of the modelling, it has also been shown that high meltwater \ntemperatures and low cavity pressures favour intrusive eruptions (Tuffen, \n2001); although these parameters are themselves dependent on the melting \nrate and eruption mechanisms and so are not strictly independent. \n \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 17\nModels applied to subglacial rhyolite at Torfaj\u00f6kull, Iceland \nQuaternary rhyolite eruptions at Torfaj\u00f6kull, Iceland occurred beneath ice \n>350 m in thickness and formed edifices between <0.1 and 1 km3 in \nvolume (Tuffen, 2001). The lithofacies formed indicate that eruptions are \neither predominantly intrusive or explosive, although at one locality both \nstyles of eruption appear to have occurred (Tuffen and others, 2006). The \neffusion rate required to give each style of eruption was calculated for a \nplausible range of ice thicknesses and is shown in Fig. 4. \n \nIntrusive eruption: Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur \nLess than 0.1 km3 of rhyolitic magma was erupted beneath >350 m of ice \nat Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur, with meltwater draining away from the vent area. The \neruption was characterised by intrusion of lava bodies into water-saturated \nhyaloclastite (Furnes and others, 1980; Tuffen and others, 2001) and the \nglacier base was close to the growing edifice throughout the eruption \n(Tuffen and others, 2002a). The eruption at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur therefore \ncorresponds to the \u2018intrusive eruption\u2019 scenario described in the models \nand required Ql < ~10 m3 s-1, for a plausible range of ice thicknesses (400-\n600 m), assuming that horizontal ice deformation was insignificant (Fig. 4). \nThe edifice volume therefore implies an eruption duration of >4 months. \n An independent estimate of the effusion rate at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur is provided by \nH\u00f6skuldsson and Sparks (1997), based on buoyant rise of rhyolitic magma \nin a dyke. Their estimate of 1-10 m3 s-1 is consistent with our model results. \n \nExplosive eruption: South-east Rau\u00f0ufossafj\u00f6ll  \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 18\nAt South-east Rau\u00f0ufossafj\u00f6ll, at least 1 km3 of magma was erupted \nbeneath >400 m of ice, forming a flat-topped tuya (Tuffen and others, \n2002b). Massive fine-grained tephra >300 m thick was emplaced during \nthe subglacial phase during explosive magma-water interaction in a well-\ndrained water- or steam-filled cavity. This eruption corresponds to the \n\u2018explosive eruption\u2019 scenario. According to the model, the effusion rate \nmust have exceeded 100 m3 s-1 for a plausible range of ice thicknesses (Fig. \n4). Using the magnitude-intensity relationships for recent and historical \neruptions given in Pyle (2000), the effusion rate expected for a plinian \neruption of this volume (1 km3) is approximately 104-105 m3 s-1. This would \nclearly be sufficient to sustain an explosive eruption, according to the \nmodels. \n \nMixed explosive-intrusive eruption: Dalakv\u00edsl \nA subglacial eruption at Dalakv\u00edsl, Raudufossafjoll was intermediate in \nstyle, including both explosive and intrusive phases (Tuffen and others, \n2006). The explosive phase initially involved fragmentation of >70 % \nvesicular magma within a subglacial cavity, but this gave way to foam \ncollapse and the rising magma began to be trapped and quenched within \nthe vesicular deposits. The relatively high dissolved water content (>0.5 wt \n%) measured using FTIR on samples of the intruded lava indicates that this \ntransition was not due to the exhaustion of magmatic volatiles (Tuffen and \nothers, 2006). Instead, it appears that the poorly-consolidated tephra had \nfilled the cavity and was intruded by partly-fragmented foam, which no \nlonger had the space to fragment or opportunity to interact explosively with \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 19\nmeltwater. The highly vesicular nature of the magma may have encouraged \nthe cavity to fill, due to the small amount of thermal energy carried per unit \nvolume of the magma (Fig. 3b). \n \nDiscussion \nOur model suggests that the effusion rate and ice thickness are important \nparameters influencing the mechanisms of subglacial rhyolite eruptions. \nThe effusion rates required for intrusive and explosive eruptions at \nTorfaj\u00f6kull are consistent with independent estimates. Viewed broadly, the \nexplosive eruptions are equivalent to plinian eruptions and the intrusive \neruptions to effusive eruptions, although the elevated volatile contents in \nintrusive facies (Tuffen and others, 2006) suggest that these contrasting \nstyles are principally due to contrasting cavity conditions rather than \ndifferent degrees of degassing. This contrasts with basaltic eruptions, \nwhere cavity pressures appear to be more important (e.g. Gu\u00f0mundsson \nand others, 2004).  \nAn explanation may be related to be inital volatile content of the \nmagma. Whereas modest (~5 MPa) changes in cavity pressure may \nsignificantly affect the vesiculation and ascent of water-poor basaltic \nmagma (H\u00f6skuldsson and others, 2006), rhyolitic magma may be so water-\nsaturated that the bulk of vesiculation occurs beneath the glacier base, \nreducing the impact of such pressure changes on its rate of ascent. This \nhighlights the need to understand the relationship between volatile \ndegassing, effusion rate and subglacial eruption mechanisms more fully, \nand this will be investigated in future work.  \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 20\nAlternatively, the lack of palagonitisation in subglacial rhyolitic \ndeposits may explain the difference, meaning that they remain loose and \nwaterlogged even during sustained eruptions. This makes it more difficult \nfor rising magma to reach the glacier base; instead it is trapped and \nquenched within the edifice. In contrast, basaltic hyaloclastite rapidly \npalagonitises (Jakobsson, 1978), possibly fast enough to cause cementation \nduring eruptions and facilitate propagation of dykes through to the glacier \nbase.  \nRegarding glacier hydrology and cavity pressures, it is important to \nremember that the models developed here are simplistic, and represent only \na first step towards the formulation of a general model of subglacial \nrhyolite eruptions. In addition to magma volatile contents, other issues to \nfurther consider include cavity morphologies (H\u00f6skuldsson and Sparks \n1997, Wilson and Head, 2002) and how cavity pressures are influenced by \nthe glacier and bedrock topography, melting rate and the existing \nsubglacial cavity system (e.g. Bj\u00f6rnsson, 1988; Gu\u00f0mundsson and others, \n2004; H\u00f6skuldsson and others, 2006).  \nFinally, our models predict that ice cauldron depths may depend on the \neffusion rate, with the deepest cauldrons formed in small effusion rate \neruptions when there is most time for ice surface deformation. Although \nthese models only poorly simulate the formation of ice cauldrons, as brittle \nprocesses are clearly important, they do raise the intriguing possibility that \napparent palaeo-ice thicknesses, as recorded by the ash-lava transition at \ntuyas, may depend upon the effusion rate, making palaeoclimatic \nreconstructions all the more difficult. This highlights the need for more \n Tuffen et al. \u2013 Explosive or intrusive subglacial eruptions? 21\nattempts to quantitatively model ice deformation and melting during \nsubglacial eruptions, to improve our understanding of past climate as well \nas the hazards from explosive eruptions and j\u00f6kulhlaups. \n \nConclusions \nThe results of simple models of subglacial rhyolite eruptions suggest that \ntheir mechanisms are influence by the effusion rate and ice thickness. At \nsmall effusion rates, subglacial cavities may become completely filled with \nvolcanic debris as roof closure is important, favouring an intrusive style of \neruption. At larger eruption rates, there is always space in the cavity for an \nexplosive eruption to occur, due to the faster rate of melting. The models \nare used to estimate the effusion rate during some Quaternary eruptions at \nTorfaj\u00f6kull and the values found are consistent with independent estimates. \nThis has been a first attempt to model the feedbacks between eruption \nmechanisms, ice melting, and ice deformation during subglacial eruptions, \nand illustrates the challenge the complexly coupled volcano-ice system \nposes for future modellers. \n \nAcknowledgements \nHT was supported by an Open University Research Studentship and by the Leverhulme \nTrust, and is indebted to Magn\u00fas Tumi Gu\u00f0mundsson for allowing him to further develop \nthese models at the University of Iceland.

Cartoons showing the (a) explosive and (b) intrusive styles of \nsubglacial rhyolite eruptions that are modelled in this paper. In each case, a \nhemispherical edifice is being constructed within a hemispherical cavity \nmelted into the glacier base and roof deformation is forming an ice \ncauldron on the surface. There is a substantial gap above the edifice in (a), \nwhich is filled by meltwater or steam and allows explosive magma-water \ninteraction to occur. In (b) the edifice completely fills the cavity and rising \nmagma intrudes within the edifice.

Model results for large and small effusion rate eruptions beneath \nice 450 m thick, indicating the changing elevation of the edifice radius, \ncavity radius and, in (a) only, the ice surface. In (a), melting is much more \nrapid than roof closure and a substantial meltwater\/steam-filled cavity is \npresent above the edifice up until roof failure, when the ice cauldron was \n~70 m deep. This is the explosive eruption scenario described in the text. In \n(b) the smaller effusion rate leads to slower melting and roof deformation \nbecomes more important. With time, the edifice begins to fill the cavity \n(arrow), leading to an intrusive style of eruption.
