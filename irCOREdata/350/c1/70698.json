It is not intended to refer to the extent to which an object might be represented from a specific viewpoint (e.g., a canonical view), which could or could not be a viewpoint from which the object has been seen. 2 Use of the term \u2018memory delay\u2019 is not intended to imply that the critical factor distinguishing short-term and longer-term remembering is the passage of time. Likely to be important is the interposition of other visual events requiring cognitive resources (e.g., attention), whether these events are external in origin (e.g., the presentation of another visual object), or internal in origin (e.g., the generation of a visual image from long-term knowledge).

Young children (5- to 7-year-\nolds) drew a familiar object, or a novel object, immediately it had been hidden from view, or \non the following day. Both objects were shown from a full range of viewpoints, or from just \ntwo viewpoints, from neither of which would either object normally be drawn after \nunrestricted viewing. When drawing from short-term memory after restricted viewing, both \nobjects were most likely to be depicted from a seen viewpoint. When drawing from longer-\nterm memory after restricted viewing, the novel object continued to be drawn from a seen \nviewpoint, but the mug was now most likely to be drawn from a preferred viewpoint from \nwhich it had not been seen. Naming the novel object with a novel count noun (\u201cLook at this. \nThis is a dax\u201d), to signal that it belonged to an object category, resulted in it being drawn in \nthe same way as the familiar object. The results concur with other evidence indicating that \nshort-term and longer-term visual remembering are differentially associated with viewpoint-\ndependent representations of individual objects and viewpoint-independent representations of \nobject categories, respectively. \nPage 2 of 31\nURL: http:\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/pmem  Email: memory@leeds.ac.uk\nMemory\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nObject Categorisation 3\nObject Categorisation, Object Naming, and Viewpoint-Independence in Visual \nRemembering: Evidence From Young Childrens\u2019 Drawings of a Novel Object\nEvidence is accumulating to suggest that short-term and longer-term visual \nremembering can rely on representations that preserve contrasting information about objects. \nFor example, compared to short-term remembering, longer-term remembering is more likely \nto reflect visual information about object categories than about specific objects (Avons & \nPhillips, 1987; Burgund & Marsolek, 2000; Marsolek, 1995), and information that specifies \nobject shape categorically rather than with metric accuracy (Rosielle & Cooper, 2001). It is \nless likely to reflect either the specific viewpoint(s) from which objects were originally seen1\n(Biederman & Cooper, 1991, 1992; Biederman & Gerhardstein, 1993; Cooper, 1994; Cooper \n& Schacter, 1992; Ellis, Allport, Humphreys, & Collis, 1989; Seamon & Delgado, 1999; \nSeamon, Ganor-Stern et al., 1997; Stankiewicz et al., 1998; Stankiewicz & Hummel, 2002), \nor the colours of objects (Brandimonte, Schooler, & Gabbino, 1997; Cooper, 1994; Hitch, \nBrandimonte, & Walker, 1995; Seamon et al., 1997; Walker et al., 1997).\nThese contrasting aspects of objects, that are differentially associated with short-term \nand longer-term remembering, might be preserved in two distinct types of visual \nrepresentation. Candidate representations are images, such as those proposed by Tarr (e.g., \nTarr, 1995), and structural descriptions, such as the geon structural descriptions (GSDs) \nproposed by Biederman (e.g., Biederman, 1995). Images are object-specific, preserve \ninformation about the object\u2019s orientation in depth relative to the viewer, and are likely to \ncapture all the visible features of an object (e.g., its surface colour). In contrast, GSDs \nrepresent object categories at an intermediate level of abstraction, and focus on the shape of \ncategory relevant object parts in their spatial configuration, to the exclusion of information \nabout an object\u2019s material properties (including colour). With shape being encoded \nPage 3 of 31\nURL: http:\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/pmem  Email: memory@leeds.ac.uk\nMemory\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nObject Categorisation 4\ncategorically, rather than with metric accuracy, GSDs are tolerant to the variation in shape \namong exemplars from a category. They are also largely insensitive to orientation in depth, \nand so can represent object categories in a way that is viewpoint-independent. Perhaps, \ntherefore, it is because these two forms of representation are differentially associated with \nshort-term and longer-term remembering, that information about contrasting aspects of \nobjects has varying relevance depending on memory delay. The proposal is not that short-\nterm and longer-term remembering are exclusively dependent on different types of \nrepresentation, but rather that, though both types of representation can support visual \nremembering in most situations, there is a tendency for short-term remembering to rely on \nimage-like representations, and longer-term remembering to rely on GSD-like structural \ndescriptions when these are available.  \nIf the various features of objects reflected in longer-term visual remembering are \npreserved in a single representation, then their impact on performance should be highly \ncorrelated. For example, when participants appear to rely on visual category representations \nin longer-term remembering, their performance should also confirm the viewpoint-\nindependence of these representations. Conversely, when participants are deprived of the \nopportunity to rely on category representations, longer-term remembering should reveal the \nsame sensitivity to viewpoint that is observed in short-term remembering, because in both \nsituations viewpoint-dependent object representations will mediate performance. \nThe two experiments reported here were undertaken as part of a project examining \nintellectual realism in young children\u2019s drawings (cf. Walker et al., 2006). As a source of \ninformation about the cognitive resources supporting drawing, young children offer the \nadvantage that they are relatively unconstrained by culturally-determined drawing \nconventions, and their drawings are susceptible to a range of variables.

Based on the understanding that naming a novel object with a \nnovel count noun can establish a category representation for the object, the second \nexperiment provides converging evidence for the role of object categorisation by examining \nthe three-way association between object naming. viewpoint-independence, and longer-term \nremembering.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1 asks if the availability of a visual object category representation will \nincrease the viewpoint-independence evident in drawings based on longer-term remembering. \nYoung children completed a simple drawing task in which they drew either a novel object or \na familiar object, under short-term or longer-term memory conditions. The novel object \ncomprised a cube with a cone attached to the centre of one face. The familiar object was a \ndrinking mug. Prior to drawing, the objects were presented for inspection, either from a full \nrange of viewpoints, or from a single viewpoint from which the cone\/handle pointed to the \nleft from the child\u2019s vantage point. This viewpoint was chosen because it is not one from \nwhich either object is normally drawn from memory after unrestricted viewing. Thus, \ndrinking mugs are normally drawn from memory with their handle pointing to the drawer\u2019s \nright. The novel object is normally drawn either with the cone pointing to the drawer\u2019s right, \nor with the cone pointing upwards (Walker et al., 2006). After being presented for inspection, \nthe objects were placed so that the cone\/handle could not be seen (i.e., with the cone\/handle \npointing directly away from the child). Neither object was named by the experimenter during \nthe experiment.\nViewpoint-dependent object representations preserve information about objects only \nin relation to the viewpoints from which they have been seen. Drawings based on these \nPage 5 of 31\nURL: http:\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/pmem  Email: memory@leeds.ac.uk\nMemory\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nObject Categorisation 6\nrepresentations should, therefore, be most likely to depict an object from a viewpoint from \nwhich it has been seen. Because geon-like structural descriptions of object categories are \nlargely invariant to viewpoint, drawings based on these need not be constrained by viewpoint \nin this way, allowing the drawer to depict an object from a viewpoint from which it has not \nbeen seen. Given the presumed viewpoint-invariance of visual category representations, it \nwas predicted that when the objects were seen from just the two viewpoints used in the \nrestricted viewing conditions, the presence of an established category representation for the \nmug would increase the likelihood of it being depicted from a different (unseen) viewpoint. \nIn addition, given the presumed association between category representations and longer-\nterm remembering, it was predicted that the effect of object familiarity would only be \nobserved with longer-term remembering. Object familiarity was not expected to have an \neffect when the objects were seen from a full range of viewpoints prior to drawing, or when \nthey were drawn from short-term memory. Put differently, memory delay2 was expected to \nimpact on drawing only when the familiar object was presented from a restricted set of \nviewpoints. \nMethod\nParticipants\nOne hundred and sixty 5- to 7-year-olds participated in Experiment 1 (mean age =  6 \nyears 4 months; age range = 5 years 0 months to 7 years 11 months).  \nMaterials\nThe familiar object was a plain white cylindrical mug, 12 cm high, with a base radius \nof 6 cm. The novel object was made from wood, and comprised a 12 cm cube with a cone \nattached to the centre of one face. The cone had a base radius of 3 cm, and a height of 8 cm. \nPage 6 of 31\nURL: http:\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/pmem  Email: memory@leeds.ac.uk\nMemory\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nObject Categorisation 7\nThis object was smoothed and painted with red gloss paint. Each child was provided with a \nsingle sheet of A4 white paper and a pencil with which to draw. \nDesign\nAn independent-groups design was created by crossing three factors, each with two \nlevels. The factors were Object Familiarity (novel object versus mug), Viewing Condition \n(restricted viewing versus unrestricted viewing), and Memory Delay (short-term \nremembering versus longer-term remembering). An equal number of participants (n = 20) \nwere assigned randomly to each of the eight groups, with the constraint that the groups were \nmatched for age and gender. \nProcedure\nAll the children were tested individually in a quiet section of their classroom, with a \ntable separating them from the experimenter. The same procedure was used regardless of the \nfamiliarity of the object to be drawn, and at no point did the experimenter provide a name for \neither object. For every child, the experimenter started by removing a plain, up-turned \ncardboard box, positioned in the centre of the table, to reveal the object to be drawn. The \nobject was positioned with its attached part (i.e., the cone or handle) pointing to the left from \nthe child\u2019s vantage point. In the restricted viewing condition, the experimenter picked up the \nobject and held it in front of the child without changing its orientation. In the unrestricted \nviewing condition, the experimenter picked up the object and proceeded to rotate it, following \na carefully rehearsed routine, so that the child was exposed equally to each major facet of the \nobject. While presenting each object to the child, the experimenter said \u201cLook at this object.\u201d \nAfter presenting the object for 20 s, the experimenter replaced it on the table with the \ncone\/handle now hidden from view, that is, with the cone\/handle pointing away from the \nchild. The experimenter then primed the child for the drawing task.

When the child returned the next day, the up-turned box was still \non the table and the experimenter said \u201cNow, could you draw the object you saw yesterday, \njust as you remember seeing it before I hid it under the box?\u201d After completing their drawing, \neach child printed their name at the top of the paper, and the experimenter noted which hand \nthey had used to draw and write. \nAn additional aspect of the experiment, of secondary importance, involved asking \nchildren in the short-term remembering condition also to return the following day to produce \na second drawing of the object. After producing their first drawing, the experimenter told \nthem \u201cTomorrow, I want you to draw this object again.\u201d Thereafter, they were treated in the \nsame way as children in the long-term remembering condition.\nResults\nIn both experiments being reported here, the view from which an object was depicted \nin each drawing was assessed by a colleague who was ignorant of the purpose of the study \nand of the conditions under which the drawings had been produced. She was shown the two \nobjects, and told that each object had been held in a single cardinal orientation directly \nin front of the drawer. In the case of the mug, it was explained that the possible \norientations involved the handle pointing directly to the drawer\u2019s left, to their right, \ndirectly towards them, or directly away from them (and, therefore, out of view).

On the basis of the child\u2019s depiction, she was \nasked to decide from which orientation the object had been viewed during drawing. In \nfact, the viewpoint from which an object was depicted in each drawing was unambiguous, \nand the first author was entirely in agreement with the judgement of his colleague.\nFigure 1 presents the number of drawings in each condition in which each object was \ndepicted from a restricted viewpoint (i.e., from one of the two viewpoints from which the \nobjects were seen in the restricted viewing conditions), as opposed to some other viewpoint.  \nAnalysis of the likelihood of depicting an object from a restricted viewpoint, as \nopposed to any other viewpoint, confirmed the impact of manipulating the viewing condition. \nThus, aggregating across levels of object familiarity and memory delay, there were \nsignificantly more drawings in the restricted viewing condition, than in the unrestricted \nviewing condition, that depicted the object from one of the restricted viewpoints, Fisher\u2019s \nExact p = .001 (except where stated otherwise, all p\u2019s reported below relate to Fisher\u2019s Exact \nProbability test). \nIn the unrestricted viewing condition, object familiarity had no effect on the \nlikelihood with which an object was depicted from a restricted viewpoint, regardless of \nmemory delay, p = .73 and .69, for short-term and longer-term remembering, respectively. \nHowever, in the restricted viewing condition, the mug was less likely than the novel object to \nbe depicted from a restricted viewpoint, but only with longer-term remembering, p = .009, \nand not with short-term remembering, p = 1.0.\nIn the unrestricted viewing condition, Memory Delay did not change the probability \nwith which an object was depicted from one of the restricted viewpoints, p = 1.0 and .27, for \nPage 9 of 31\nURL: http:\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/pmem  Email: memory@leeds.ac.uk\nMemory\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nObject Categorisation 10\nthe novel object and mug, respectively. However, it did have an effect in the restricted \nviewing condition, but only for the mug. Specifically, whereas delaying the test of memory in \nthe restricted viewing condition had no impact on the likelihood with which the novel object \nwas depicted from a restricted viewpoint, p = .75, memory delay reduced the likelihood of \nthis in the case of the mug, p = .001.\nSecondary analysis. Figure 2 presents data from the children in the short-term \nmemory condition, all of whom returned to produce a drawing from long-term memory. \nAnalysis of the drawings produced from longer-term memory by these children \nconfirmed the results obtained from those children who produced a drawing only from long-\nterm memory. Thus, with regard to the second of the two drawings produced by children in \nthe short-term memory condition, there were significantly more drawings in the restricted \nviewing condition, than in the unrestricted viewing condition, that depicted the object from \none of the two restricted viewpoints, p = .023. In addition, whereas object familiarity had no \neffect on the viewpoint from which an object was depicted in the unrestricted viewing\ncondition, p = .41, it did have an effect in the restricted viewing condition, p = .053, with the \nmug being less likely than the novel object to be depicted from a restricted viewpoint. \nWhen both drawings produced by this group of children were submitted to a \nMcNemar Test for change, a significant change in depicted view with memory delay was \nobserved only for drawings of the mug in the restricted viewing condition. Thus, in the \nunrestricted viewing condition, there was no significant change in depicted view with \nmemory delay either for drawings of the novel object, McNemar p = .25, or for drawings of \nthe mug, McNemar p = .50. In the restricted viewing condition, there was no significant \nchange in depicted view with memory delay for drawings of the novel object, McNemar p = \n.625, but there was a significant change for the mug, McNemar p = .004.

When handedness and gender \nwere taken into account, neither had a significant impact on the viewpoint from which either \nobject was depicted.\nDiscussion\nWhen young children drew an object from memory, the extent to which their \ndepictions were constrained by the viewpoints from which the object had been seen was \ninfluenced by the object\u2019s familiarity, and by whether the object was being drawn from short-\nterm or longer-term memory. Specifically, with the shift from short-term to longer-term \nremembering, the children became more inclined to depict a familiar object from a (normally \npreferred) viewpoint from which it had not been seen. The same trend was absent in their \ndrawings of a novel object. This three-way association between object familiarity, viewpoint-\nindependence, and memory delay, was predicted on the basis that distinct types of visual \nobject representation are differentially associated with short-term and longer-term \nremembering (cf. Introduction). To reiterate, though viewpoint-dependent, image-like \nrepresentations of objects, and viewpoint-independent, GSD-like structural descriptions of \nobject categories, are normally available to support both short-term and longer-term \nremembering, there is a tendency for people to utilise the former in short-term remembering \nand the latter in longer-term remembering. Because GSD-like category representations were \navailable only for the mug, only for this object could the viewpoint-independence of these \nrepresentations remove the constraints associated with restricted viewing when the children \ndrew from long-term memory.

(2003), in a study of semantic dementia, have shown that with memory \ndelay drawings can become progressively more dependent on generic visual knowledge, even \nwhen the instruction is to draw the particular object the experimenter had shown them. With \nthis in mind, some uncertainty must remain concerning the extent to which depictions of the \nmug from an unseen viewpoint after restricted viewing in the present study were drawings of \na generic mug, rather than drawings of the particular mug shown to them by the \nexperimenter. Uncertainty remains because there was nothing distinctive about the mug that, \nif reproduced in the drawing, would have confirmed that it was that specific mug that was \nbeing drawn. In principle, such uncertainty can be removed by using novel objects as \nexperimental stimuli, especially if a simple and effective way can be found to induce \nparticipants to establish a category representation for a novel object on the basis of a single \nencounter.\nRosch et al. (1976) and Hoffman, Denis, and Ziessler (1983) have demonstrated that \ncommon object names are linked most directly to visual representations of object categories \nat an intermediate level of abstraction (i.e., at the basic-level). The impact of object naming \non the creation of category representations confirms this privileged link. Thus, naming a \nnovel object with a novel count noun induces infants and young children to establish a shape-\nbased category representation for the object (Baldwin, 1989; Hall, 1993; Hall & Moore, \n1997; Hall, Quantz, & Persoage, 2000; Hall & Waxman, 1993; Landau, 1994; Landau, \nSmith, & Jones, 1988; 1992; Smith, Jones, & Landau, 1992; Waxman, 1999; Waxman & \nPage 12 of 31\nURL: http:\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/pmem  Email: memory@leeds.ac.uk\nMemory\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nObject Categorisation 13\nBooth, 2001; Waxman & Hall, 1993; Waxman, Philippe, & Branning, 1999; Waxman, \nSenghas, & Benveniste, 1997) at an intermediate taxonomic level (Hall, 1993; Hall & \nWaxman, 1993; Waxman, 1999; Waxman & Hall, 1993; Xu, Carey, & Welch, 1999). \nIf the children in the longer-term memory condition of Experiment 1 were drawing \nfrom a category representation of the mug, then it should be possible to arrange for the novel \nobject to be treated in the same way as the mug. Specifically, the likelihood of depicting the \nnovel object from an unseen viewpoint after restricted viewing should be increased by \narranging for it to be named with a novel count noun prior to drawing from longer-term \nmemory (cf. Walker, Blake, & Bremner, 2008, for supporting evidence from adults). No such \neffect would be expected when the novel object is drawn from short-term memory. \nExperiment 2 tests this hypothesis by asking young children to draw the novel object from \nshort-term or longer-term memory, after restricted or unrestricted viewing, with the \nexperimenter either naming the object with a novel count noun or not naming it.\nMethod\nParticipants\nTwo hundred and forty 5- to 7-year-olds participated (mean age = 6 years 5 months; \nage range = 5 years 0 months to 7 years 11 months).\nMaterials\nThe novel object used in Experiment 1 was the only object used in Experiment 2.\nDesign\nAn independent-groups design was created by crossing three factors, each with two \nlevels.

In this condition, as the \nobject was being presented for inspection prior to being placed in position for drawing, the \nexperimenter said \u201cLook at this, this is a dax.\u201d When the object had been placed in position \nfor drawing, with the cone hidden from view, the experimenter continued with \u201cLook at this \ndax as it appears to you now, because tomorrow I want you to draw it as it appears to you \nnow.\u201d Then, when the children returned the next day to draw the object, the experimenter \ncontinued with \u201cNow, could you draw the dax you saw yesterday, just as you remember \nseeing it before I hid it under the box?\u201d\nResults\nFigure 3 presents the number of drawings in each condition in which the object was \ndepicted from a restricted viewpoint, as opposed to some other viewpoint.\nAnalysis of the likelihood of depicting the object from a restricted viewpoint \nconfirmed the impact of viewing condition. Thus, aggregating across levels of object naming \nand memory delay, there were significantly more drawings in the restricted viewing\ncondition, than in the unrestricted viewing condition, that depicted the object from a \nrestricted viewpoint, Fisher\u2019s Exact p < .001. \nIn the unrestricted viewing condition, object naming had no effect on the likelihood of \ndepicting the object from a restricted viewpoint, regardless of memory delay, p = .76 and \n1.00, for short-term and long-term remembering, respectively.

However, it did have an effect in the restricted viewing\ncondition, but only when the object was named. Specifically, whereas delaying the test of \nmemory in the restricted viewing condition had no impact on whether the object was depicted \nfrom a restricted viewpoint when the object was not named, p = .42, it reduced the likelihood \nof this when the object was named, p = .032.\nFinally, only five participants drew with their left hand. When handedness and gender \nwere considered as factors, neither had a significant impact on the viewpoint from which the \nnovel object was depicted in the children\u2019s drawings.\nDiscussion\nYoung children engaged in the object drawing task were induced to treat the novel \nobject in the same way that children in Experiment 1 had treated the mug. Thus, when the \nobject was named with a novel count noun as it was being inspected prior to drawing, their \ndrawings from longer-term memory became independent of the viewpoints from which the \nobject had been seen. Their drawings from short-term memory were not influenced by object \nnaming.\nBecause naming a novel object with a novel count noun is known to induce children \nto establish a category representation for the object (cf. above), this new result helps to \nconfirm that it was the availability of a visual category representation that allowed the \nchildren in Experiment 1 to draw the mug from longer-term memory in a way that was \nindependent of the particular viewpoints from which it had been seen.

Specifically, though viewpoint-dependent object representations and \nviewpoint-independent structural descriptions of object categories can both support short-\nterm and longer-term remembering, the former representations tend to be most influential in \nshort-term remembering, the latter in longer-term remembering. Given the relative \ninsensitivity of GSD-like structural descriptions of object categories to orientation in depth, \nand their privileged links with object (category) names, it is understandable that both object \nfamiliarity and object naming induced children to depict objects in ways that were not \nconstrained by the particular viewpoints from which the objects had been seen. The fact that \nthis was observed only with longer-term remembering, and not with short-term remembering, \nconfirms the three-way association between object categorisation, viewpoint-independence, \nand longer-term remembering.\nChildren in the restricted viewing condition were induced to depict the objects from a \nviewpoint from which the objects had not been seen, even though they had been requested to \ndepict them from the final viewpoint from which they had been seen (i.e., with the \nhandle\/cone hidden from view). It could be argued, therefore, that object familiarity and \nobject naming both impaired performance. \nThe potentially detrimental effects of object familiarity and object naming on visual \nremembering, and the restriction of these effects to longer-term remembering, have also been \nrevealed in studies of visual image combination (cf. Brandimonte, Hitch, & Bishop, 1992;\nPage 16 of 31\nURL: http:\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/pmem  Email: memory@leeds.ac.uk\nMemory\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nObject Categorisation 17\nHitch, Brandimonte, & Walker, 1995; Walker et al., 1997). In these studies, participants were \nasked to combine a visual image of a recently presented line drawing with an image of a \ncurrent line drawing. They were then to discover the identity of the object resulting from this \ncombination. The nature of the to-be-combined drawings was such that identification of the \nemerging object required the superimposition of the two images in the mind\u2019s eye to be \nmetrically accurate. In some situations, the recently presented visual stimulus was either still \navailable in short-term memory (because no other item had been presented in the interim), or \nwas available only in longer-term memory (because other task-relevant items had been \npresented in the interim). In addition, it was arranged that when the memory item depicted a \nfamiliar object, it was either named or unnamed at presentation. In agreement with the results \nof the present study, participants were less able to complete the image combination task if the \nobject depicted in the first drawing was named at presentation. Moreover, this detrimental \neffect of naming was observed only with longer-term remembering, and not with short-term \nremembering. Walker et al. (1997) proposed that performance was impaired by object \nnaming because this induced participants to increase their reliance on a visual representation \nof the category to which the object belonged, with the effect that the shape of the object \nbecame less accurately described (i.e., there was a shift towards shape being described \ncategorically rather than with metric accuracy). Finally, additional support for the current \nproposal emerged with the observation that performance in the image combination task was \ninsensitive to the colour congruity of the to-be-combined stimuli, but only when longer-term \nremembering was being assessed and the first of the two figures had been named (Hitch, \nBrandimonte, & Walker, 1995; Walker et al., 1997). With short-term remembering, image \ncombination was impaired when the two figures to be combined appeared in different colours \n(e.g., black-on-grey and white-on-grey), rather than the same colour (e.g., both black-on-\nPage 17 of 31\nURL: http:\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/pmem  Email: memory@leeds.ac.uk\nMemory\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nObject Categorisation 18\ngrey), regardless of whether or not the first figure was named. In other words, whereas the \nvisual representation supporting longer-term remembering resembled a GSD-like \nrepresentation insofar as it did not preserve object colour, the visual representation supporting \nshort-term remembering resembled an image-like representation insofar as it preserved object \ncolour independently of object naming.\nMuch of the evidence confirming the impact of distinct types of visual representation \nin longer-term remembering has involved the contrast between implicit and explicit tests of \nmemory (see, for example, Cooper, 1994, and Srinivas, 1996). For example, though long-\nterm priming in object naming and object decision tasks has been shown to involve visual \nrepresentations that do not preserve information about viewpoint and object colour, explicit \nrecognition memory for the same stimuli has been shown to involve visual representations \npreserving information about these two features (Biederman & Cooper, 1991, 1992; Cooper, \n1994; Cooper & Schacter, 1992; Seamon & Delgado, 1999; Seamon, Ganor-Stern et al., \n1997; Srinivas, 1996). Clearly, therefore, a full account of the representational basis of visual \nremembering will need to acknowledge the distinction between implicit and explicit tests of \nmemory. Nevertheless, the results reported here confirm that an explicit test of memory  (i.e., \nthe present object drawing task) can reveal the varying contributions of different types of \nvisual representation. Although the image combination task also is a test of explicit memory \nthat can do this, the object drawing task has the advantage that there are no restrictions on the \nstimuli that can be utilised.\nPage 18 of 31\nURL: http:\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/pmem  Email: memory@leeds.ac.uk\nMemory\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nObject Categorisation 19\nReferences\nAvons, S.

It is not intended to refer to the extent to which an object might be \nrepresented from a specific viewpoint (e.g., a canonical view), which could or could not be a \nviewpoint from which the object has been seen.\n2\n Use of the term \u2018memory delay\u2019 is not intended to imply that the critical factor \ndistinguishing short-term and longer-term remembering is the passage of time. Likely to be \nimportant is the interposition of other visual events requiring cognitive resources (e.g., \nattention), whether these events are external in origin (e.g., the presentation of another visual \nobject), or internal in origin (e.g., the generation of a visual image from long-term \nknowledge).\nPage 24 of 31\nURL: http:\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/pmem  Email: memory@leeds.ac.uk\nMemory\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\nObject Categorisation 25\nFigure Captions\nFigure 1.
