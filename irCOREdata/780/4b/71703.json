Aldershot and Burlington: Ashgate, 2003. 253 pp. ISBN 0754622827. $114.95\/\u00a359.95.\nReviewed by Sol Picciotto\nProfessor of Law, University of Lancaster\nAlthough the enthusiasm for the concept of globalisation has taken a darker complexion since 9\/11,\nit still provides a convenient label for a variety of purposes. However, its attractions also make it\nunhelpful and misleading, not least because while it suggests increasing global unity, it is generally\nused to draw attention to the often competitive interactions between diverse societies and cultures.\nMercifully, the editor of this collection has avoided using the term \u2018globalisation\u2019 in its title, although\nthe papers result from a symposium on Globalisation and the Universalisation of Legal Norms\nhosted by the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence at the University of Sydney, linked with\nWilliam Twining\u2019s delivery of the inaugural Julius Stone Address in August 2000. The revised text\nof that Address provides the lead paper in this collection, and a background to the other papers,\nalthoughmany of them also refer to Twining\u2019s earlier work in this vein, much of whichwas collected\nin a revised version in Globalisation and Legal Theory (2000).\nGeneralisability\nCollections of writings assembled around the law-and-globalisation theme are likely to suffer from the\nlack of a clear common understanding or theory either of globalisation, of law, or both, leading to\nincoherence. Attempting to avoid this trap, the editor of this collection focuses her introductory\nchapter, boldly entitled \u2018NewDirections for Jurisprudence\u2019, on Twining\u2019s identification of the problem\nof \u2018generalisability\u2019: the investigation ofwhich concepts \u2018travelwell\u2019. This, he suggests, is a high priority\ntask for a revived general analytical jurisprudence, which he considers is needed in response to the\nchallenges of globalisation. Although the essays of the other contributors understandably vary in the\nextent to which they address the issue of generalisability, it does provide a connecting thread for an\notherwise varied collection.\nTwining\u2019s paper in this collection is part of an ongoing project to develop a \u2018general jurisprudence\u2019\nwhich he suggests might underpin the increasingly cosmopolitan character of law as a discipline, by\n\u2018theorising that treats generalisations across legal families, traditions, cultures and orders as proble-\nmatic\u2019 (Twining, 2005, p. 6). Central to this is a revival of general analytical jurisprudence, an argument\nfor which is made in this paper, and further developed in a paper which was apparently at that time in\ndraft (as indicated in footnote 45), but has now been published in the first issue of this journal\n(Twining, 2005), and which goes over much of the same ground, although with some new material.\nThe contribution of jurisprudential conceptual analysis is to provide \u2018sustained critical analysis of the\nadequacy of our existing stock of concepts for transnational legal discourse, both law talk (the\ndiscourse of rules and its presuppositions) and talk about law (discourses about any legal phenomena)\u2019\n(Twining, 2005).\nTwining seeks to establish a wider version of analytical jurisprudence than the familiar and\nmuch-criticised version associated with the linguistic analysis and logical positivism school typified\nInternational Journal of Law in Context, 1,4 pp. 427\u2013434 (2005) Cambridge University Press\nDOI: 10.1017\/S1744552305004064 Printed in the United Kingdom\nespecially by Herbert Hart. To do so he builds on Julius Stone\u2019s scheme dividing jurisprudence into\nthree parts, the analytical, the sociological and \u2018theories of justice\u2019, which for Twining entail\nanalytical, empirical and normative inquiries. However, these inquiries seem to proceed in parallel,\nrather than in combination. He certainly seeks to explain his project in the context of current\ndebates about globalisation, from which he draws his analysis of the challenges that it poses to\n\u2018traditional\u2019 legal theory (p. 26), which is perhaps an exercise in sociological jurisprudence. He also\nadopts a much broader perspective on law than that of the positivists, encompassing \u2018the structure,\nconcepts, values, and practical operation of institutionalised ordering of relations between persons\n(human, legal, unincorporated, and other), not just relations within a single state or society or\nbetween sovereign states\u2019 (p. 23). This might result from normative inquiry, or perhaps might also be\nsociological.\nThese inquiries affect the range, scope and purpose of his analytical jurisprudence, but they do\nnot seem to influence either its object or methodology. Twining sees the task as the analysis of\nconcepts, deploying a range of tools not only from analytical philosophy but also related disciplines,\nand extending over a much wider range of concepts than does traditional analytical philosophy, due\nto his wider definition of law, and his concern not only with law talk but also talk about law\n(Twining, 2005, p. 12). The aim is to develop conceptual clarity and hence an understanding of which\nconcepts \u2018travel well\u2019. He states that \u2018So far my tests of travelling far and well are mainly empirical\nand pragmatic: does it fit? Does it work? Can the same concepts be used with roughly the same\nmeaning in England and Italy, or in California, Tanzania and Japan? . . . I think that these ideas need\nto be refined\u2019 (p. 33; Twining, 2005, p. 9). Applied to some case studies, he finds that the term\n\u2018inhuman treatment\u2019, despite leaving room for substantial disagreements in concrete cases, does\ntravel well \u2018in that, first, it provides a framework for debating such issues; second, it provides a direct\nlink to the idea of basic human needs; but, third, it allows some flexibility in respect of its\ninterpretation and application in different social and economic contexts\u2019. On the other hand, the\nterm \u2018corruption\u2019 (and related concepts such as bribery) \u2013\n\u2018seem to travel reasonably well in respect of the modern public sector of nation states, especially\nstate bureaucracies, but are more problematic outside this specific context. The strongly emotive\nlanguage of this discourse is more suited to individual ethics than large-scale systemic practices,\nis often tendentious and probably hampers detached analysis and comparison.\u2019 (p. 41)\nThis analysis is certainly \u2018contextual\u2019, in that it takes account of how the terms are used by various\nactors and in different social contexts (Chinua Achebe, the World Bank, Transparency International).\nHowever, this context is simply background: no theory is used to try to understand the social nature or\nfunction of the concepts analysed, or the social practices within which they are developed and\ndeployed. The term \u2018corruption\u2019 is found to be less generalisable than \u2018inhuman treatment\u2019, because\nit tends to be used in contexts which are emotive and for expressing concerns about individual\nmorality, which makes the discourse about corruption unsuitable for \u2018relatively detached analysis\nand comparison\u2019 (p. 40). Hence the differences lie not in the character of the concepts themselves, but\nperhaps in the broader discourses and social contexts inwhich they are used, aboutwhich, presumably,\nanalytical jurisprudence cannot say much. Twining\u2019s pragmatism is in many ways a strength: his\ncritical and sceptical approach, and personal experience of some of the social contexts he considers,\nallow him to make some interesting observations. However, he considers law in its social context, but\nnot law as a social process.\nThis is perhaps surprising, since Twining has been strongly influenced by Karl Llewellyn\u2019s Realist\napproach to \u2018law jobs\u2019, and in the past couple of decades many helpful insights from social theory have\nhelped shape our understanding of how law works and what lawyers do. Especially relevant to his\nconcern with analysing concepts has been the work on lawyering as an interpretive practice, and\nlawyers as conceptual ideologists. This goes beyond some of the earlier structuralist approaches to the\nSOL PICCIOTTO428\nlaw and lawyers, which tended to a rather static view, and the intrepretivist approach suggests that\nlawyering should be seen as part of a broader ensemble of processes which help create the social world\n(McCahery and Picciotto, 1995). Similarly, Pierre Bourdieu has discussed the practices of interpretation\nof legal texts, involving the appropriation of the \u2018symbolic power which is potentially contained\nwithin the text\u2019, in terms of competitive struggles to \u2018control\u2019 the legal text (Bourdieu, 1987, p. 818).\nHowever, he suggests that coherence emerges, partly because to succeed competing interpretations\nmust be presented \u2018as the necessary result of a principled interpretation of unanimously accepted texts\u2019,\nand partly through the social organisation of the field (Bourdieu, 1987, p. 818).\nLaw in global governance\nRather than taking globalisation simply as the context, it might be more interesting and fruitful to\nconsider the role that law and lawyers are playing in helping to construct new forms of what is now\ndescribed as global governance. Indeed, this role does seem significant, and there is no shortage either\nof advocates of or explanations for this. In evaluating the trend towards the legalisation of world\npolitics, an influential group of commentators has suggested that law contributes three features:\nrules which are regarded as binding, which are precise, and the interpretation of which can therefore\nbe delegated to a judicial body (Abbott et al., 2003). However, this view of legalisation, which rests on\nan essentially Weberian perspective, has been criticised as taking a narrow view of law.1 It focuses\nessentially on law between states (traditional public international law), and rests on the idea that law\ncan constrain power by helping to ensure that states are held to the bargains they make, if these\nagreements can take the form of \u2018credible commitments\u2019.\nIn contrast, William Twining\u2019s broader view of law encompasses \u2018the global, international,\ntransnational, regional, inter-communal, municipal (nation, state and subsidiary jurisdictions),\nsub-state local and non-state local\u2019, and he understands that they \u2018interact, overlap, and sometimes\nconflict in extremely complex ways\u2019 (p. 23). This was much less so in the classical liberal interna-\ntional system, which rested on the sovereignty of the nation-state, and a legal hierarchy which, at\nleast in principle, was much clearer. This was essentially dualist, with the state\u2019s government acting\nas the hinge: the horizontal plane of international law, created by and binding only states, and the\nvertical dimension of the internal law of states, which applies to individual legal persons. State law\ncould also tolerate, or even encourage, a variety of private normative orders, while reserving to itself\nthe monopoly of legitimate coercion. However, as the centrality of state law has become substan-\ntially eroded, there has been a blurring of the distinctions between formally binding law and other\nnormative orders, as well as the growth of complexity in interactions between the various legal\narenas that Twining notes.\nHowever, these changes are not just part of an external \u2018context\u2019 impinging on law.Many of them\nhave been wrought by and through legal transformations, and lawyers have themselves played an\nimportant role in these processes. The concept of \u2018transnational law\u2019 was developed in U.S. law\nschools at the height of the Cold War, when the theory and practice of international relations were\nstill firmly based on realist power-politics, and it laid the basis for the emergence of a generation of\nlawyers equipped to export U.S.-style business lawyering around the world.2 \u2018Supranational law\u2019 was\n1 This issue is discussed in greater detail, taking the example of the World Trade Organization, in Picciotto (2005).\n2 Philip Jessup\u2019s Storrs lectures at Yale (Jessup, 1956) established the concept, which was developed through\nlaw school courses, notably at Harvard by Henry Steiner and Detlev Vagts, as well as at Chicago, taught in the\nearly 1960s (when William Twining and I were both there) by Kenneth Dam, who later served as Deputy\nSecretary of State under Reagan and Deputy Secretary to the Treasury under George W. Bush, before\nreturning to Chicago.\nREVIEW ESSAY 429\nlargely created by the activist jurisprudence, exploiting the concept of \u2018direct effect\u2019, of the European\nCourt of Justice, operating within a broader network of academic and practising lawyers and judges\nat every level. More broadly, lawyers have been active in developing a competitive interaction\nbetween legal arenas or jurisdictions, which both results from and facilitates strategies of forum-\nselection and forum-shifting. Examples include mass disaster or large-scale liability litigation, such\nas the Bhopal or Cape Asbestos cases, and the lobbying in various forums for strengthening and\nextension of intellectual property protection. Even more radically, new legal arenas have been\ncreated, perhaps most strikingly in the development of \u2018offshore\u2019 jurisdictions offering facilities as\ntax or regulatory \u2018havens\u2019 (Hampton and Abbott, 1999; Palan, 2003). The resulting system of offshore\nfinance has played a key part in the global economy, allowing those able to exploit the facilities they\noffer to build enormous finance-based empires. Another example is the creation of the new lex\nmercatoria, which has also been described as \u2018a sort of offshore justice\u2019 (Dezalay and Garth, 1995,\np. 54), developed by the competition between national centres for commercial arbitration.\nPhilip Alston, in a paper suggesting that international lawyers should rethink their discipline in\nthe light of changes in the form of state sovereignty, suggests that their failure to do so is a surprising\nmyopia in view of their role as \u2018handmaidens of the changes wrought by globalisation\u2019 (Alston,\n1997). William Twining\u2019s focus on the problem of generalisability is, in my view, very helpful in\nidentifying the dilemmas posed by the changing role of law in contemporary global governance.\nHowever, this is not just a matter of a challenge to law created by external forces. Since, as I have\nargued, lawyers play an active part in shaping these changes, the choices we make in reformulating\nboth the law and our understanding of it will significantly affect the direction of broader social\nchanges.\nThis is especially important, since a central function of law is to help provide legitimacy, which is\nboth urgent and problematic in a period of global social change and political destabilisation such as\nthe present. For some, such as the commentators referred to at the beginning of this section,\nlegitimacy is thought to be provided by law because it offers a logical application of precise or\nunambiguous rules prescribing obligatory conduct, to implement politically-determined aims\n(Abbott et al., 2000). This implies a formalist view of law, as a process for decision-making which is\ntechnical-rational. However, this technicist legitimacy is undermined by the shift away from classical\nliberal internationalism, since its assumption that political accountability is provided essentially\nthrough national state governments becomes harder to maintain.\nThis is perhaps the challenge to law from globalisation that William Twining has in mind. The\ndecentered, heterarchical and interactive character of the new forms of governance suggests a\ndifferent explanation for the increased role of law in global governance: that it is precisely the\nflexibility of the process of formulation and application of rules through interpretative practices that\nis law\u2019s strength. This gives lawyers a key role in managing the multiple interactions of regulatory\nnetworks (which indeed they help to create), and enables law to offer both the promise of univers-\nality and the possibility of adaptation to specific and local circumstances. Law provides a basis for\naccommodating the diversity of local and national social and cultural particularities to the increas-\ningly globally integrated world market, and to manage conflicts resulting from power disparities\n(Picciotto, 1997, p. 266).\nYet Twining is right to be sceptical as to the ability of law to deliver on these promises. However, I\nsuggest that the answer lies not in jurisprudential analysis of the legal concepts themselves, but in a\nconsideration of the practices within which they are generated and deployed. It may well be possible\nfor a legal principle to \u2018travel well\u2019 if its articulation and interpretation are confined to a relatively\nclosed community of specialists, who can generate and maintain a shared understanding of how it\nshould be applied. This is what Bourdieu means by suggesting that conceptual coherence can result\nfrom the social organisation of the field (which he also refers to as \u2018habitus\u2019). Others have argued that\nglobal governance is facilitated by the work of \u2018epistemic communities\u2019, who are seen as experts with\nSOL PICCIOTTO430\na shared world-view derived from their technical specialism, insulating them at least partially from\nthe short-term and special interest pressures generated in both the political and economic spheres.\nThe growing influence of such experts especially in relation to global governance issues is seen to\nresult from the increasing complexity of policy decisions and ontological uncertainty (Haas, 1992).\nClearly, however, the closed and elitist nature of such specialist communities tends to exclude any\nbroader popular or democratic participation in their work.\nHence, the increased power of such groups, deriving from their specialised knowledge which\nenables them to define agendas, set boundaries and define solutions, also brings responsibilities.\nPerhaps most important among these, as I have argued elsewhere (Picciotto, 2001, pp. 349\u201351) is the\nobligation to operate reflexively and with an awareness of how their professional or scientific\npractices and contributions impact on the quality of public debate. This entails avoiding a technicist\nrationality, which can operate in an autocratic way if it claims spurious authority (Wynne, 1992), by\nacknowledging the ways in which their techniques rest on formalist assumptions allowing them to\nbuild generalisations and models based on abstractions frommessy reality. Thus, they should accept\nthat the conclusions they reach are of only partial or conditional validity, and not determinative of\npolicy decisions but contributions to public debates. This suggests that the objectivism of a closed,\ntechnicist and instrumental rationality should be replaced by a more open, discursive rationality,\nakin to Habermas\u2019s communicative rationality, which may facilitate democratic deliberation\n(Dryzek, 1990, 1999).\nCase studies\nThe remaining chapters in this book mostly consist of interesting explorations of specific issues,\ngrouped around three headings, money, people and cultures, although inevitably there is some\noverlap. First, however, David Goldman contributes a paper which ranges over the last millennium\nto provide some historical background which certainly gives a different perspective on some of the\ncontemporary febrile globalisation talk.\nSundhya Pahuja goes beyond formal law to examine the regulatory practices of international\neconomic institutions, especially the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade\nOrganization. She finds that both of these operate through discursive practices in which economic\nconcepts play a normative role, and she emphasises the power contained in these discourses. Hence,\nto Twining\u2019s scepticism about the possibilities of generalisation she adds a strong warning that both\ngeneralisable concepts and any general jurisprudence developed to analyse themmust pay \u2018attention\nto the discursive power of the narratives in which those conceptual tools are embedded\u2019 (p. 82).\nDimity Kingsford Smith contributes a characteristically thorough study of globalised securities\nregulation, deploying theories of legal pluralism as well as Boa de Sousa Santos\u2019 concept of\n\u2018interlegality\u2019 to analyse the relationship between the principles developed by IOSCO (the\nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions) and the regulation of securities markets\nthrough national law and national and local regulators. Interestingly, she finds that \u2018[b]roadly\nexpressed principles like those of IOSCO are excellent vehicles for the specification of interests\nand values. They are much less good for the technical or precise jobs of law such as specifying the\npassage of title or risk\u2019 (p. 119). Thus, she finds that in a sense IOSCO principles probably do travel\nwell, by promoting imitation, incorporation and convergence towards the interests and values they\nexpress, which are those of the dominant parties in the specialist community. However, by taking\ninsufficient account of the needs and circumstances of weaker parties, the principles may lack both\nefficacity and legitimacy. As an example she cites the preference of IOSCO for a more permissive\ndisclosure-based regime, which allows securities to be issued provided adequate information is\ngiven, and is perhaps more suited to more developed markets with sophisticated investors, rather\nthan regulation based on prior approval, which might be cheaper and more appropriate to\nREVIEW ESSAY 431\nemerging markets. Thus she, like Pahuja, warns that generalisable rules may lack legitimacy, in the\nsense both of wide acceptability and effectiveness.\nThe chapter by Jill Murray considers the international diffusion of labour standards, which has\nbeen the aim of the International Labour Organization (ILO) for nearly a century. Although the ILO\nhas developed some innovative features, it has essentially relied on a top-down or \u2018command-and-\ncontrol\u2019 model, suitable for the liberal international system in which it was founded. More recently,\nhowever, new possibilities have opened up, as a result of consumer awareness and activist pressures\non transnational corporations (TNCs) and their global supply chains, especially those reliant on\nreputation symbolised by brand-names (Klein, 2000). This has resulted in the growth of a plethora of\ncorporate and industry-based codes of conduct, whichmostly operate as \u2018soft law\u2019 standards (Jenkins,\n2002). Murray critically examines the analysis of some authors who have argued that this approach\noffers the possibility of ratcheting up labour standards, although within a strengthened frame-\nwork for enforcement rather than the voluntary self-regulation normal with such codes. She\nsuggests that to focus on TNCs as well as on excessive abuses such as child labour reproduces an\nolder paternalist model, and might neglect the importance of establishing standards applicable to all\nworkers through national legislation, co-ordinated through a representative international organisa-\ntion such as the ILO. However, I suggest that the two approaches may not be exclusionary (Picciotto,\n2003). Indeed, some of the international activist campaigns aim both to use codes to spread ILO\nstandards and strengthen national law, as well as combining consumer activism and labour\norganisation.3\nThe remaining papers are rather more loosely linked to the issue of generalisability, and focus\nrather on the impact of changes described as globalisation. Kim Rubinstein\u2019s chapter considers the\nconcepts of citizenship and nationality, and argues that the element of social cohesion represented\nby the concept of citizenship has become attenuated in an increasingly fragmented world. However,\nshe argues that the development of a principle of effective rather than merely formal nationality in\ninternational law, linked with a progressive citizenship project which accepts the possibility of\nmultiple allegiances, would be more consonant with a cosmopolitan and rights-based\ninternational law.\nThe editor herself contributes another interesting essay, which applies an analysis of changes in\nmigration laws and controls on illegal migration to examine some aspects of globalisation theories,\nespecially about sovereignty. Although she suggests that the tightening of immigration controls and\nthe demonisation of illegal immigrants reinforce the nation-state, this is clearly a contradictory\nprocess. The drive for tighter controls on movement of people is in many ways ineffective: as she\npoints out (fn. 53), even the United States admits that almost 2% of its population are \u2018illegals\u2019. A\ncloser examination of the actual enforcement of these controls would also show, I suggest, that\nnational authorities must operate through international networks which combine public and\nprivate actors, for examples airlines.\nAdamCzarnota\u2019s chapter considers the transplantation to the countries of eastern Europe of rule-\nof-law institutions, which has accompanied their abrupt post-communist exposure to the capitalist\nworld market. His preliminary assessment is that this has produced a \u2018limping\u2019 rule of law, since it\nwas imposed from above, unaccompanied by any changes in social values especially of the elites.\nFinally, Mark Findlay considers the global changes in the nature of crime and its control. He\nargues that the universalisation of crime problems, such as narcotic drugs, terrorism and corruption,\nand the construction of globalised and politicised control strategies, are largely symbolic. Thus, he\nseems to echo Dimity Kingsford Smith\u2019s view that co-ordination in global governance is mainly a\nmatter of attempting to foster convergence through concepts which embody values. His enigmatic\n3 Notably, the Clean Clothes Campaign: www.cleanclothes.org.\nSOL PICCIOTTO432\nconclusion is that the paradox of globalisation lies in the way in which \u2018it makes harmony amask for\ndiversity, and difference a concealment of fusion\u2019 (p. 247, citing Findlay, 1999).\nInterconnections?\nThe many and diverse issues explored in these papers certainly confirm William Twining\u2019s intui-\ntion that generalisability is problematic. However, they perhaps shed a different light on the nature\nof the problems. Conceptual coherence may well result from the cohesion of specialist groups who\nformulate global regulatory principles, but this may not suffice to ensure either their broader\nacceptability or their effectiveness. Although legal or normative principles may offer both the\narticulation of universal values and the flexibility for adaptation to local circumstances through\ninterpretation, they may still lack legitimacy. At the same time, the fragmentation of the classical\nliberal international system has also undermined political accountability through representative\ndemocracy in the national state. All these factors suggest, as a number of commentators have\nargued, a need for new forms of democratic deliberation. An important element of this, which is\nessential to avoid the dangers of rule by technocratic elites, is to foster a more discursive rationality.\nThis applies equally to legal practices and analyses of them. If a general jurisprudence can\ncontribute to this, then so much the better.\nReferences\nABBOTT, Kenneth, et al.
