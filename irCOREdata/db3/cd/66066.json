London:\nStationery Office, 2000.\n(Accepted 23 July 2001)\nImpact of Effective Health Care bulletin on treatment of\npersistent glue ear in children: time series analysis\nJames Mason, Nick Freemantle, George Browning\nDuring the 1980s, surgery for chronic otitis media with\neffusion (glue ear) increased greatly without obvious\nreason.1 \u201cDry taps\u201d\u2014absence of effusion upon\nincision\u2014were common, probably because the surgery\nwas performed without the surgeon confirming that\nthe condition had not already resolved.2 An Effective\nHealth Care bulletin on the treatment of persistent glue\near in children was distributed nationally to NHS deci\u203a\nsion makers in 1992.2 Based on systematic review, the\nbulletin concluded that surgery should be restricted to\nchildren with an extended period of substantial\nhearing impairment, with persistence and severity\nestablished by watchful waiting. We evaluated surgery\nrates before and after distribution of the bulletin.\nMethods and results\nQuarterly numbers of D151 procedures\u2014insertion of a\nventilation tube through the tympanic membrane\u2014\nperformed in children aged under 15 in England from\n1989 to 1996 were obtained from the hospital episodes\nsystem. We calculated per capita regional and national\nrates for this procedure.3\nWe applied a generalised linear model with a\nheterogeneous first order autoregressive structure and\nrepeated measures by region. The effect of the\nintroduction of the bulletin was nested into the model\nusing \u2018proc mixed\u2019 in SAS version 8 (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC). This approach consistently identifies the\nbest autoregressive structure (the model adjusts for the\nrelatedness of sequential observations over time). We\ninvestigated regional variations in surgical rates by\ncomparing standard error terms from the model\nbefore and after distribution of the bulletin. Overall,\nthe model included data from 14 regions, each of\nwhich provided results from 28 quarters, half before\nand half after distribution of the bulletin.\nIn 1992, 77 766 grommet insertions were con\u203a\nducted; this was equivalent to a quarterly rate of 2.1 per\nPapers\nCentre for Services\nResearch, University\nof Newcastle upon\nTyne, Newcastle\nupon Tyne\nNE2 4AA\nJames Mason\nprofessor of health\neconomics\ncontinued over\nBMJ 2001;323:1096\u20137\n1096 BMJ VOLUME 323 10 NOVEMBER 2001 bmj.com\n1000 children, with regional rates varying by a factor of\ntwo. A small increase in the quarterly rate of\nprocedures per 1000 children during the three years\nbefore distribution of the bulletin (0.026 (95%\nconfidence interval \u2212 0.022 to 0.073)) became a\ndecrease in the four years after publication ( \u2212 0.044\n( \u2212 0.080 to \u2212 0.011); P < 0.0001) (figure). The decrease\nin quarterly rate from 1992 onwards was seen consist\u203a\nently across the regions.\nThe changing trend in surgery suggests that 89 800\nprocedures were avoided nationally in the four years\nafter the bulletin, providing a theoretical saving of \u00a327m\nat 1992\u203a3 prices.2 Regional variations in the numbers of\nsurgical procedures undertaken were 30% smaller after\ndistribution of the bulletin than before (SE 0.0169 v\n0.0242). Our findings were not substantially altered by\nanalysing procedures under the broader code D15\n(drainage of the middle ear) or by age range.\nComment\nDistributing printed recommendations to decision\nmakers may influence surgery rates, since a trend\ntowards a reduction in the number of grommet opera\u203a\ntions was seen after distribution of the bulletin. Rates\nfor tonsillectomy\u2014another elective procedure in the\nsame specialty\u2014increased steadily over the same\nperiod, suggesting that the change was specific to per\u203a\nsistent glue ear and thus was related to the bulletin.\nThe change cannot be attributed to the bulletin\nalone, which was commissioned because of pre\u203aexisting\nconcerns about appropriate use of the procedure. Its\npublication received coverage in the medical and aca\u203a\ndemic press,4 possibly encouraging doctors to examine\ntheir own practices and bring about behavioural change.\nSurgery rates were reduced, and there was an\napparent improvement in the equality of care, but our\nresults do not provide information on quality of care\ndelivered by either general practitioners or surgeons.\nAdherence to watchful waiting principles may have\npromoted more appropriate (and reduced) patient\nselection; alternatively, primary care physicians alerted\nby media concerns may have reduced referral rates.\nEstablishing the link between health service activity\nand quality of care remains difficult.\nThe estimated savings from reduced surgery\n(\u00a327m) are considerably greater than the approximate\nproduction cost of the bulletin (\u00a325 000). Another bul\u203a\nletin addressing the prescribing of selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors demonstrated a similar profile of\ncosts.5 Although the apparent healthcare savings are\nimpressive, the impact on health outcomes, costs of\nalternative care received by patients, and costs of other\nhealth promoting activities remain unknown.\nContributors: JM had the original idea for the study, helped with\ndata analysis, drafted the paper, and acts as guarantor.
