The application of Acoustic Emission (AE) for bearing \ndiagnosis is gaining ground as a complementary diagnostic tool, however, limitations in the \nsuccessful application of the AE technique have been partly due to the difficulty in \nprocessing, interpreting and classifying the acquired data. Furthermore, the extent of bearing \ndamage has eluded the diagnostician. The experimental investigation reported in this paper \nwas centered on the application of the Acoustic Emission technique for identifying the \npresence and size of a defect on a radially loaded bearing. An experimental test-rig was \ndesigned such that defects of varying sizes could be seeded onto the outer race of a test \nbearing. Comparisons between AE and vibration analysis over a range of speed and load \nconditions are presented.  In addition, the primary source of AE activity from seeded defects \nis investigated.  It is concluded that AE offers earlier fault detection and improved \nidentification capabilities than vibration analysis. Furthermore, the AE technique also \nprovided an indication of the defect size, allowing the user to monitor the rate of degradation \non the bearing; unachievable with vibration analysis.  \nKeywords: Acoustic Emission, bearing defect, condition monitoring, defect size, vibration \nanalysis. \n 2\n1. Introduction  \nAcoustic emissions (AE) are defined as transient elastic waves generated from a rapid release \nof strain energy caused by a deformation or damage within or on the surface of a material [1]. \nIn this particular investigation, AE\u2019s are defined as the transient elastic waves generated by \nthe interaction of two surfaces in relative motion. The interaction of surface asperities and \nimpingement of the bearing rollers over the seeded defect on the outer race will generate \nAE\u2019s.  Due to the high frequency content of the AE signatures typical mechanical noise (less \nthan 20kHz) is eliminated. \n \n2. Bearing defect diagnosis and Acoustic Emissions \nThere have been numerous investigations reported on applying AE to bearing defect \ndiagnosis.  Roger [2] utilised the AE technique for monitoring slow rotating anti-friction slew \nbearings on cranes employed for gas production.  In addition, successful applications of AE \nto bearing diagnosis for extremely slow rotational speeds have been reported [3, 4]. Yoshioka \nand Fujiwara [5, 6] have shown that selected AE parameters identified bearing defects before \nthey appeared in the vibration acceleration range.  Hawman et al [7] reinforced Yoshioka\u2019s \nobservation and noted that diagnosis of defect bearings was accomplished due to modulation \nof high frequency AE bursts at the outer race defect frequency. The modulation of AE \nsignatures at bearing defect frequencies has also been observed by other researchers [8, 9, \n10]. Morhain et al [11] showed successful application of AE to monitoring split bearings with \nseeded defects on the inner and outer races. \n \nThis paper investigates the relationship between AE r.m.s, amplitude and kurtosis for a range \nof defect conditions, offering a more comparative study than is presently available in the \npublic domain. Moreover, comparisons with vibration analysis are presented. The source of \n 3\nAE from seeded defects on bearings, which has not been investigated to date, is presented \nshowing conclusively that the dominant AE source mechanism for defect conditions is \nasperity contact. Finally a relationship between the defect size and AE burst duration is \npresented, the first known detailed attempt. \n \n3. Experimental Test Rig and Test Bearing \nThe bearing test rig employed for this study had an operational speed range of 10 to 4000rpm \nwith a maximum load capability of 16kN via a hydraulic ram.  The test bearing employed \nwas a Cooper split type roller bearing (01B40MEX).  The split type bearing was selected as it \nallowed defects to be seeded onto the races, furthermore, assembly and disassembly of the \nbearing was accomplished with minimum disruption to the test sequence, see figure 1. \nCharacteristics of the test bearing (Split Cooper, type 01C\/40GR) were: \no Internal (bore) diameter, 40mm \no External diameter, 84mm \no Diameter of roller, 12mm \no Diameter of roller centers, 166mm \no Number of rollers, 10 \nBased on these geometric properties the outer race defect frequency was determined at \u20184.1X\u2019 \n(4.1 times the rotation shaft speed). The layout of the test rig is illustrated in figure 2, with the \nload zone at top-dead-centre. \n 4\n \nFigure 1 Bearing Test Rig \n \nFigure 2 Test rig layout \nHydraulic ram \nTest bearing\n 5\n4. Data Acquisition System and signal processing \nThe transducers employed for vibration and AE data acquisition were placed directly on the \nhousing of the bearing, see figure 1. A piezoelectric type AE sensor (Physical Acoustic \nCorporation type WD) with an operating frequency range of 100 kHz \u2013 1000 kHz was \nemployed whilst a resonant type accelerometer, with a flat frequency response between 10 Hz \nand 8000 Hz (Model 236 Isobase accelerometer, \u2018Endevco Dynamic Instrument Division\u2019) \nwas used for vibration measurement. Pre-amplification of the acoustic emission signal was \nset at 40dB. The signal output from the pre-amplifier was connected (i.e. via BNC\/coaxial \ncable) directly to a commercial data acquisition card. The broadband piezoelectric transducer \nwas differentially connected to the pre-amplifier so as to reduce electromagnetic noise \nthrough common mode rejection. This acquisition card provided a sampling rate of up to \n10MHz with 16-bit precision giving a dynamic range of more than 85 dB. In addition, anti-\naliasing filters (100 KHz to 1.2MHz) were built into the data acquisition card. A total of \n256,000 data points were recorded per acquisition (data file) at a sampling rates of 2MHz, \n8MHz and 10MHz, dependent on simulation. Twenty (20) data files were recorded for each \nsimulated case, see experimental procedure. The acquisition of vibration data was sampled at \n2.5 KHz for a total of 12,500 data points. \n \nWhilst numerous signal processing techniques are applicable for the analysis of acquired \ndata, the authors have opted for simplicity in diagnosis, particularly if this technique is to be \nreadily adopted by industry. The AE parameters measured for diagnosis in this particular \ninvestigation were amplitude, r.m.s, and kurtosis. These were compared with identical \nparameters from vibration data. It is worth stating that the selected parameters for AE \ndiagnosis are also typical for vibration analysis.  \n \n 6\nThe most commonly measured AE parameters for diagnosis are amplitude, r.m.s, energy, \ncounts and events [12]. Counts involve determining the number of times the amplitude \nexceeds a preset voltage (threshold level) in a given time and gives a simple number \ncharacteristic of the signal. An AE event consists of a group of counts and signifies a \ntransient wave. Tan [13] sited a couple of drawbacks with the conventional AE count \ntechnique. This included dependence of the count value on the signal frequency. Secondly, it \nwas commented that the count rate was indirectly dependent upon the amplitude of the AE \npulses. \n \nBy far the most prominent method for vibration diagnosis is the Fast Fourier Transform. This \nhas the advantage that a direct association with the characteristics of rotating machine can be \nobtained. Other vibration parameters include \u2018peak-to-peak\u2019, \u2018zero-to-peak\u2019, r.m.s, crest \nfactor and kurtosis. The drawback with amplitude parameters is that they can be influenced \nby phase changes and spurious electrical spikes. The kurtosis value increases with bearing \ndefect severity however, as severity worsens the kurtosis value can reduce. The r.m.s \nparameter is a measure of the energy content of the signal and is seen as a more robust \nparameter. However, whilst r.m.s may show marked increases in vibration with degradation, \nfailures can occur with only a slight increase or decrease in levels. For this reason r.m.s \nmeasurement alone is sometimes insufficient. \n \n5. Experimental procedure \nTwo test programmes were undertaken.  \no An investigation to ascertain the primary source of AE activity from seeded defects \non bearings was undertaken, in addition to determining the relationship between \ndefect size, AE and vibration activity. In an attempt to identify the primary source of \n 7\nAE activity, a surface topography (Form Talysurf 120L; stylus used had a 2um radius \ndiamond tip) of the various defects was taken. Furthermore, two types of defect \nconditions were simulated; firstly, a seeded defect with a surface discontinuity that \ndid not result in material protruding above the average surface roughness of the outer \nrace. The second defect type resulted in material protrusions that were clearly above \nthe average surface roughness.  \no The second test programme aimed to establish a correlation between AE activity with \nincreasing defect size. This was accomplished by controlled incremental defect sizes \nat a fixed speed.  \n \nPrior to defect simulations for all test programmes, baseline, or defect free, recordings were \nundertaken for twelve running conditions; four speed (600, 1000, 2000 and 3000 rpm) and \nthree load conditions (0.1, 4.43KN and 8.86KN). Defects were simulated with the use of an \nengraving machining employing a carbide tip. \n \n6. Test programme-1; AE source identification and defects of varying severities \nFive test conditions of varying severities were simulated on the outer race of the test bearing \nwhich was positioned in the load zone; top-dead-centre for this particular test-rig \nconfiguration, see table 1.  In addition, the nomenclature used to label all test conditions is \ndetailed in table 1.  The test conditions were: \no Baseline or defect free condition in which the bearing was operated with no defect on the \nouter-race. Figure 3 shows a visual condition of the race and a surface roughness map \n(maximum 0.5 \u00b5m). \no A point defect engraved onto the outer race which was approximately 0.85 x 0.85mm, see \nfigure 4.  This defect condition had material of the outer race protruding approximately 4 \n 8\n\u00b5m above the bearing maximum surface roughness. \no A line defect, approximately 5.6 x 1.2 mm, see figure 5. \no A rough defect, approximately 17.5 x 9.0 mm, see figure 6. \no A smooth defect in which a surface discontinuity, not influencing the average surface \nroughness, was simulated. In this particular instance a grease hole on the outer race \nmatched the requirements, see figure 7. From figure 7 it is evident that the point of \ndiscontinuity of the surface does not have a protrusion above the surface roughness as \nevident for the \u2018point\u2019 or \u2018line\u2019 defect conditions. The main purpose of this simulation is \nto observe if any changes in the load distribution will lead to generation or changes in AE \nactivity in comparison to a defect free condition. \nAll defects were run under four speeds (600, 1000, 2000 and 3000 rpm) and three different \nloads (0.1, 4.43 and 8.86 KN). It must be noted that the defect length is along the race in the \ndirection of the rolling action and the defect width is across the race. \n \n 9\nTable 1  Notation for test programme-1 with seeded defect dimensions \nDefect Type (W x L) mm Speed (rpm) Load (kN) \nN Noise (No Defect) S1 600 L0 0.1 \nSD Smooth Defect S2 1000 L1 4.43 \nPD Point Defect (0.85x0.85) mm S3 2000 L2 8.86 \nLD Line Defect (5.6x1.2) mm S4 3000  \nT\nes\nt p\nro\ngr\nam\nm\ne \n-1\n: D\nef\nec\nts\n o\nf \nD\niff\ner\nen\nt S\nev\ner\niti\nes\n \nRD Big Rough Defect (17.5x9.0) mm  \n \n-2.00E-03\n-1.50E-03\n-1.00E-03\n-5.00E-04\n0.00E+00\n5.00E-04\n1.00E-03\n1.50E-03\n2.00E-03\nDistance Along the Race\nM\nilli\nm\net\ner\ns\n \nFigure 3 Surface profile of defect free condition \n 10\n-4.00E-03\n-3.00E-03\n-2.00E-03\n-1.00E-03\n0.00E+00\n1.00E-03\n2.00E-03\n3.00E-03\n4.00E-03\n5.00E-03\nDistance Along the Race\nM\nilli\nm\net\ner\n0.85 mm\n \nFigure 4 Surface profile of point defect condition \n-2.50E-03\n-2.00E-03\n-1.50E-03\n-1.00E-03\n-5.00E-04\n0.00E+00\n5.00E-04\n1.00E-03\n1.50E-03\n2.00E-03\nDistance Along the Race\nM\nilli\nm\net\ner\ns\n1.2 mm\n \nFigure 5  Surface profile of a line defect condition \n 11\n \nFigure 6  Rough defect condition \n-1.00E-02\n-8.00E-03\n-6.00E-03\n-4.00E-03\n-2.00E-03\n0.00E+00\n2.00E-03\n4.00E-03\n6.00E-03\nDistance Along the Race\nM\nilli\nm\net\ner\nDefect (Hole) Starts Here\nEdge of Defect is Smooth\n \nFigure 7 Surface profile of a smooth defect condition \n 12\n7. Test programme-2; Defects of varying size \nFor this particular test programme, two experiments (E1 and E2) were carried out to \nauthenticate observations relating AE to varying defect sizes.  Each experiment included \nseven defects of different lengths and widths, see table 2.  A sample defect is shown in figure \n8.  In experiment-1 (E1), a point defect (D1) was increased in length in three steps (D2 to D4) \nand then increased in width in three more steps (D5 to D7).  However, in experiment-2 (E2), \na point defect was increased in width and then in length interchangeably from D1 to D7.  \nBoth experiments were run at 2000 rpm and at a load of 4.4kN.  The AE sampling rates for \nthe first and second experiments are 8MHz and 10 MHz respectively.  In experiment-2, \nvibration was acquired in addition to AE for comparative purposes. \n \nTable 2 Notation for test programme-2 with seeded defect dimensions \n \nExperiment 1 Experiment 2 \nDefect Size, (width x length) mm Defect Size, (width x length) mm \nE1-D0 No defect E2-D0 No defect \nE1-D1 0.85 x 0.85 mm E2-D1 0.85 x 1.35 mm \nE1-D2 1 x 2.95 mm E2-D2 2. x 1.35 mm \nE1-D3 1 x 7.12 mm E2-D3 2 x 4 mm \nE1-D4 1 x 15.83 mm E2-D4 4 x 4 mm \nE1-D5 3.98 x 15.83 mm E2-D5 8 x 4 mm \nE1-D6 8.66 x 15.83 mm E2-D6 13 x 4 mm \nT\nes\nt P\nro\ngr\nam\nm\ne \n2:\n D\nef\nec\nts\n o\nf D\niff\ner\nen\nt S\niz\nes\n \nE1-D7 13.6 x 15.83 mm E2-D7 13x 10 mm \n 13\n \nFigure 8 The largest seeded defect, E1-D7, 13.6 x 15.83 mm \n \n8. Analysis Procedure \nIf the defects simulated were to produce AE transients, as each rolling element passed the \ndefect, it was envisaged that the AE bursts would be detected at a rate equivalent to the outer \nrace defect frequency (\u20184.1X\u2019). In addition, it was also anticipated that the defect frequency \nwould be observed in the vibration frequency range. \n \nFor test programme 1 (defects of different severities) AE in time domain and vibrations in \nfrequency domain were analysed.  Furthermore, the AE and vibration r.m.s, maximum \namplitude and kurtosis values were calculated.  Approximately twenty AE data files were \ncaptured per fault simulated. Each data file was equivalent to one, two, four and six \nrevolutions at speeds of 600, 1000, 2000 and 3000rpm respectively. Every AE data file (for \nall simulations) was broken into sections equivalent to one revolution. For instance, at \n2000rpm the AE data was split into four equal sections, each representing one shaft \nrevolution. \n 14\n \nThe diagnostic parameters of r.m.s, etc, were calculated for each shaft revolution and \naveraged for all data files. This implied that at 2000rpm, and for twenty data files, a total of \neighty AE r.m.s values were calculated and the value presented is the average of the eight \nvalues. For vibration analysis, two data files were acquired for each simulation. This was \nequivalent to 50, 83, 166 and 250 revolutions per data file at speeds of 600, 1000, 2000 and \n3000rpm respectively. The exact procedure for calculating the AE parameters was employed \non the vibration data. \n \nFor test programme-2 observations of AE burst duration, r.m.s and amplitude for the various \ndefect sizes were undertaken. The burst duration was obtained by calculating the duration \nfrom the point at which the AE response was higher than the underlying background noise \nlevel to the point at which it returned to the underlying noise level. This procedure was \nundertaken for every data file and the average value for each simulated case is presented. \n \n9. Data Analysis; Test Programme-1 \n9.1 Observations of AE time waveform  \nAs already stated the outer race defect frequency was calculated for the various test speeds; \n41, 69, 137 and 205Hz at 600, 1000, 2000 and 3000rpm respectively. Typical AE and \nvibration time waveforms for two different conditions are displayed in figures 9 and 10.  It \nwas noted that for all defects conditions, other than the smooth defect, AE burst activity was \nnoted at the outer race defect frequency.  Observations of AE time waveforms from noise and \nsmooth defect conditions showed random AE bursts that occurred at a rate which could not \nbe related to any machine phenomenon.  Correspondingly, such transient bursts associated \nwith the presence of the defect were not observed on vibration waveforms, but more \n 15\ninterestingly, the outer race defect frequency was not observed on the frequency spectra of \nmost vibration data, except at one defect condition; rough defect, 3000rpm, load 0.1KN, see \nfigure 11. \n  \nFigure    9 AE time waveforms for all defects at a speed of 1000 rpm and a load  \n4.43kN \nN \n \n \n \n \n \nSD \n \n \n \n \nPD \n \n \n \n \nLD \n \n \n \n \nRD \n 16\n  \nFigure 10 Vibration time waveforms for all defects at a speed of 1000 rpm and a \nload 4.43kN \nN \n \n \n \n \n \nSD \n \n \n \n \nPD \n \n \n \n \nLD \n \n \n \n \nRD \n 17\n \nFigure 11  Sample vibration data in the frequency domain \nBPO = 205 Hz S4-L0-RD \nS3-L1-RD \nS2-L2-RD \nS1-L1-RD \n 18\n9.2 Observations of r.m.s values \nThe r.m.s values of AE and vibration signatures for all defect and defect free conditions were \ncompared for increasing speeds, see figures 12 and 13.  For all test conditions, the AE r.m.s \nvalue increased with increasing the speed at a fixed load.  It was also noted that the AE r.m.s \nvalues of noise and smooth defect were similar while AE r.m.s values increased with \nincreased defect severity; point, line and rough defects respectively. For a fixed speed and \nvariable load it was observed that in general AE r.m.s increased with load, which increased \nalso with increasing defect severity, see figure 1 of appendix B. The vibration r.m.s values \nshowed a relatively small increase with increasing defect size, however, a clear increase in \nvibration r.m.s was observed for the rough defect, see figure 13.  Table 1 in appendix A \nhighlights the percentage change of r.m.s values for different defect sizes, emphasising the \nsensitivity of AE to defect size progression, see figures 14 and 15.  The percentage values \npresented in Appendix A and figures 14 and 15 were obtained by relating all speed and load \ndefect simulations to the corresponding speed and load condition for the defect free (noise) \nsimulation. Figures 1 and 2 of appendix B show the vibration and AE r.m.s values for \nincreasing loads at fixed speeds. \n 19\n1.00E-03\n1.00E-02\n1.00E-01\n1.00E+00\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4\nN SD PD LD RD\nA\nE\n r.\nm\n.s\n.

Also it was evident that as the defect size was increased, the maximum AE \namplitude increased. The maximum AE amplitude increased from noise condition to the \npoint defect and increased further for the line defect.  The maximum amplitude for the rough \ndefect was comparable to the \u2018line\u2019 defect. Again it was noted that values for \u2018noise\u2019 and \n\u2018smooth\u2019 conditions were similar. Vibration amplitude values were similar for all defect \nconditions except for the rough defect, see figure 17.  Table 2 in appendix A highlights the \npercentage changes of maximum amplitude values for different defect sizes.  These were \ndetermined as detailed in the previous section. Figures 3 and 4 of Appendix B show the \nvibration and AE maximum amplitude values for increasing loads at fixed speeds. \n \n 22\n0.01\n0.10\n1.00\n10.00\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4\nN SD PD LD RD\nA\nE\n M\nax\nim\num\n A\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (v\nol\nts\n)\nL0\nL1\nL2\n \nFigure 16 AE max amplitude of different defects at increasing speeds and fixed load \n0.10\n1.00\n10.00\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4\nN SD PD LD RD\nV\nib\nra\ntio\nn \nM\nax\n A\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (v\nol\nts\n)\nL0\nL1\nL2\n \nFigure 17 Vibration max amplitude of different defects at increasing speeds and \nfixed load \n \n 23\n9.4 Observations of Kurtosis \nKurtosis is a measure of the peakness of a distribution and is widely established as a good \nindicator of bearing health for vibration analysis. For a normal distribution, kurtosis is equal \nto 3.  The AE kurtosis values for the noise signal (N) and the smooth defect (SD) were \napproximately \u20183\u2019, see figure 18, as expected for a random distribution.  It was noted that as \ndefect size increased from \u2018noise\u2019 to \u2018point\u2019 to \u2018line\u2019, the kurtosis values increased \naccordingly.  For the worst defect condition it was observed that the kurtosis values were \nlower than for the preceding defect condition (line defect). This was not unexpected because \nas the defect condition worsens it is known that kurtosis values will decrease; figure 18 \ndepicts this observation.  Kurtosis results for vibration showed similar values for all defect \nsimulations apart from the rough defect where a relative increase was noted, see figure 19 \nTable 3 in appendix A highlights the change of kurtosis values for different defect sizes, \nemphasising the sensitivity of AE to defect size progression. Figures 5 and 6 of Appendix B \nshow the vibration and AE kurtosis values for increasing loads at fixed speeds. \n \n 24\n1.00E+00\n1.00E+01\n1.00E+02\n1.00E+03\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4\nN SD PD LD RD\nA\nE\n K\nur\nto\nsi\ns \nV\nal\nue\nL 0\nL 2\nL 5\n \nFigure 18 AE kurtosis of different defects at increasing speeds and fixed load \n1.00\n10.00\n100.00\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4 S1 S2 S3 S4\nN SD PD LD RD\nV\nib\nra\ntio\nn \nK\nur\nto\nsi\ns \nV\nal\nue\nL0\nL1\nL2\n \nFigure 19 Vibration kurtosis of different defects at increasing speeds and fixed load \n 25\n10. Data analysis: Test programme-2 \nThe analysis of this test program was centered on AE time domain observations. \n \n10.1. Observations of experiment-1 (E1) \n \nThis experiment included seven defect conditions; D1 to D4 had a fixed width with \nincreasing length while defects D4 to D7 had a fixed length with increasing width; see table \n2. From observations of the AE time waveforms, AE bursts were clearly evident from defects \nD4 to D7, see figure 20.  The x-axis in these figures corresponds to one shaft revolution at \n2000rpm.  For defects D4 to D7 the width of associated defect AE burst was measured in an \nattempt to relate the AE burst duration to the defect size.  Interestingly, the bursts with equal \ndefect length D4 to D7 had near identical burst durations, see figure 21.  For the other defects \n(D1 to D3), the burst duration could not be separated from underlying background noise, \nmost probably due to the size of the seeded defect.  Also it was observed that the ratio of \namplitude of the AE burst to underlying operational background noise increased \nincrementally from D4 through to D7, as the defect increased in width, see table 3. \nTable 3 Burst to noise ratio\u2019s for defects of fixed defect length (15.8mm) \n \nDefect Burst duration (second) \nBurst amplitude \n(volt) \nNoise amplitude\n(volt) \nBurst to noise \nratio \nD4 0.0061 0.13 0.09 1.4:1 \nD5 0.0056 0.18 0.09 2.0:1 \nD6 0.0056 0.33 0.11 3.0:1 \nD7 0.0056 0.46 0.10 4.6:1 \n \nTwo conclusions can be drawn, firstly, increasing the defect width increased the ratio of burst \namplitude to operational noise (i.e., the burst signal was increasingly more evident above the \noperational noise levels, see figure 20). Secondly, it was deduced that increasing the defect \nlength increased the burst duration.  To confirm this, a second experiment was performed \nutilizing the same running conditions but with different defect size combinations. \n 26\nFurthermore, the second test was undertaken to ensure repeatability, and a new bearing of \nidentical type to that used in experiment-1 was employed. \n \nFigure 20 Sample AE time wave forms for defects D0 to D7 (Experiment-1) \n \nD0           D1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nD2           D3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nD4           D5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nD6           D7 \n 27\n \nFigure 21 Burst duration for defect D6 & D7 (Experiment-1) \n \n \n10.2.

It was also observed that the AE bursts for defects D3 to D6 (figure 23) were similar; \nthese defects had the same length of 4 mm.  Clearly when the defect was increased in length \nfrom 4mm to 10mm (D6 to D7) the burst duration increased dramatically, see figures 23 and \n24. \n \n0.0056 s \n0.0056 s \n0.0056 s \n 28\nTable 4 Burst to noise ratio\u2019s for defects with a fixed length (4mm) and a defect \n(D7) with an increased length (10mm) \n \nDefect Burst duration (second) \nBurst amplitude \n(volt) \nNoise amplitude\n(volt) \nSignal to noise \nratio \nD3 0.0018 0.17 0.10 1.7:1 \nD4 0.0018 0.24 0.09 2.7:1 \nD5 0.0019 0.32 0.10 3.2:1 \nD6 0.0019 0.43 0.11 3.9:1 \nD7 0.0036 0.42 0.11 3.8:1 \n \n \n 29\n \nFigure 22 Sample AE time wave-forms for defects D0 to D7 (Experiment-2) \n \nD0        D1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nD2        D3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nD4      D5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nD6        D7 \n 30\n \nFigure 23 AE waveform bursts for defects D5-D6 (Experiment-2) \n \nFigure 24 AE waveform burst for defect D7 (Experiment-2) \n \n \nA summary of AE burst duration for experiments-1 and -2 are detailed in table 5.

Discussions \n \nThe source of AE for seeded defects is attributed to material protrusions above the surface \nroughness of the outer race. This was established as the smooth defect could not be \ndistinguished from the no-defect condition. However, for all other defects where the material \nprotruded above the surface roughness, AE transients associated with the defect frequency \nwere observed. As the defect size increased, AE r.m.s, maximum amplitude and kurtosis \nvalues increased, however, observations of corresponding parameters from vibration \nmeasurements were disappointing. Although the vibration r.m.s and maximum amplitude \nvalues did show changes with defect condition, the rate of such changes highlighted the \ngreater sensitivity of the AE technique to early defect detection, see appendix A. Again, \nunlike vibration measurements, the AE transient bursts could be related to the defect source \nwhilst the frequency spectrum of vibration readings failed in the majority of cases to identify \nthe defect frequency or source. Also evident from this investigation is that AE levels increase \nwith increasing speed and load. It should be noted that further signal processing could be \napplied to the vibration data in an attempt to enhance defect detection. Techniques such as \ndemodulation, band pass filtering, etc, could be applied though these were not employed for \nthis particular investigation. The main reason for not applying further signal processing to the \nvibration data was to allow a direct comparison between the acquired AE and vibration \nsignature. From the results presented two important features were noted; firstly, AE was more \nsensitive than vibration to variation in defect size, and secondly, that no further analysis of \nthe AE response was required in relating the defect source to the AE response, which was not \nthe case for vibration signatures. \n \nThe relationship between defect size and AE burst duration is a significant finding. In the \n 34\nlonger term, and with further research, this offers opportunities for prognosis. AE burst \nduration was directly correlated to the seeded defect length (along the race in the direction of \nthe rolling action) whilst the ratio of burst amplitude to the underlying operational noise \nlevels was directly proportional to the seeded defect width.  \n \nThe variation of all data presented for test programme\u2019s 1 and 2 are detailed in tables 1 to 3 in \nAppendix C and tables 1 to 4 in appendix D. The standard deviation and coefficient of \nvariation (CV) for all parameters presented in the paper are detailed.  The CV is a measure of \nthe relative dispersion in a set of measurements. From appendix C it was noted that the \naverage CV for r.m.s, maximum amplitude and kurtosis for AE was 17%, 43% and 73% \nrespectively. Correspondingly the average CV for equivalent vibration parameters was 11%, \n26% and 43%. This showed that the kurtosis measurements\/calculations had a greater \nvariability about the average value than r.m.s and maximum amplitude. For test programme-2 \nthe CV was less than 20% for AE parameters and just over 30% for vibration parameters. \n \n12 Conclusion \n \nIt has been shown that the fundamental source of AE in seeded defect tests was due to \nmaterial protrusions above the mean surface roughness.  Also, AE r.m.s, maximum amplitude \nand kurtosis have all been shown to be more sensitive to the onset and growth of defects than \nvibration measurements. A relationship between the AE burst duration and the defect length \nhas been presented. \n \n \n \n 35\n13.           References \n \n1. Mathews, J. R.
