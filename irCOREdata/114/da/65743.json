Instead of being arrested and punished for prostitution-related offences, \nthose under 18 years olds were to be thought of as child \u201ein need\u201f and offered welfare-\nbased interventions. The practice that has developed in the last three years, however, has \noffered interventions that are located within both child protection work and youth justice. \nThis article examines these changes in order to generate insights about the changing \nnature of youth justice and, more specifically, about the ways that managerialism and \ncorporatism have created a structure in which the desire to care for vulnerable young \npeople and the demand to punishment troubling youths is rendered less relevant than \nmanaging them. Through an analysis of how the practitioners and policy makers in \ncharge of implementing Britain\u201fs new youth prostitution policy talk about \u201erisk\u201f and \n\u201eresponsibility\u201f, \u201eliability\u201f, \u201eprotection\u201f and \u201epunishment\u201f, article argues that the \ncontradiction between care and control has been re-interpreted such that there is \nnoticeable blurring of the boundaries between welfare and punishment at the margins of \nyouth justice work.  \n \nthat took place subsequent to this guidance to examine changes within youth justice more \nbroadly. Specifically, it is argue that the desire to care for troubled young people and the \n 3 \ndemand to punish the troubling has not been displaced by managerialism and \ncorporatism, but rather , indeed, been displaced by recent  \nIntroduction: \n \nSince New Labour came to power in May 1997 virtually every aspect of how \nyoung lawbreakers are dealt has been subject to broad and sweeping changes. Many of \nthese changes concerned the treatment of specific groups of offenders (i.e. \u201epersistent \nyoung offenders\u201f) and have attracted attention from both within academic circles and \nwithout. But, there have been no less significant changes to the treatment meted out to \nother groups of offenders that has attracted little academic and virtually no public \nattention. Young people involved in prostitution is one such group. Change here, whilst \n\u201equieter\u201f and at the edges of both youth justice and child protection, has been no less \nsweeping or profound. In May 2000, the Department of Health and Home Office issued \nguidance (entitled Safeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution) that enjoined welfare \nand criminal justice agencies to treat young people in prostitution differently than adults, \nand specifically, to treat them as potential victims rather than as offenders of prostitution-\nrelated laws. Put simply, whereas once a 14, 15 or 16 year old girl in prostitution could be \ncautioned, arrested, charged and punished in the same way as a 21, 35 or 52 year old, \nnow they are to be treated as young people \u201eat risk\u201f or experiencing \u201esignificant harm\u201f. \nThis paper draws on two different research projects\n1\n and asks what, if anything, can be \nunderstood about changes in youth justice more broadly through an examination of shifts \n                                                 \n1 The first research project examined the implementation of the new guidance via interviewing senior police officers, \nsocial service managers and directors, voluntary organisations workers and project managers and any other individuals \nresponsible for implementing the DOH\/HO guidance in five local authorities in England. The second research project \ncatalogued and analyzed the provision for young people in prostitution in England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Data \nwas collected via a national survey and a prolonged series of telephone interviews with every local authority (or similar \nbody) within the UK.  \n 4 \nat the margins. Whilst the focus of the paper is about young people in prostitution, the \nmain theme is the diverse and less than predictable ways that the borders between what is \nconceived of as child protection and youth justice are actively being re-constituted. The \nargument I put forward takes Muncie\u201fs and Hughes\u201f observations about recent changes to \nyouth justice (Muncie & Hughes 2002) and develops the case that the contradictions \nbetween welfare and punishment have not so much been displaced as they have been \naccommodated in ways that the boundaries between them blur and the distinction become \nmuch less clear.  I argue that: (i) the ideologies of managerialism and corporatism allow \nfor an accommodation of the contradiction at the heart of youth justice between the desire \nto care for vulnerable young people and the demand to punish their lawbreaking; (ii) the \nprimary strategy making this accommodation possible is multi-agency work with \n\u201etroubling\u201f young people; (iii) the focus of this work becomes the identification and \nmanagement of risk, albeit in a context that includes the management of risks that some \nyoung people pose to the organisation concerned (i.e. social service, voluntary \norganisations and police); (iv) in so doing, the distinction between protection and \npunishment blur in ways that render the contradictory plausible, meaningful and above all \nelse not contradictory.  \nThis article is divided into four sections. In the first section I offer some thoughts \non the various ways that troubled and troubling young lives are governed in order to \nframe the discussion that follows. In the second section, I outline the change to policy \nand practice initiated by Department of Health and Home Office guidance. Following on \nfrom this, I provide an analysis of the diverse ways that \u201erisk\u201f is understood within the \nmulti-agency approach that was adopted for working with young people in prostitution \n 5 \nbefore moving on to discuss the actual interventions that have been put in place \nsubsequent to the guidance. In the final section I detail three key ways in which the \nboundaries between protection and punishment blur.  \n \nYOUTH GOVERNANCE \n \nSince the middle of the nineteenth century, official treatment of young people in \ntrouble has oscillated between the twin (but opposing) poles of the desire to protect and \nthe impulse to punish just as young people themselves have been variously understood as \nvictims and villains. Such understandings shape fundamentally different and divergent \nprovisions (Brown 1996, Muncie 1996, Pitts 1988, 2003). Whereas the construction of \nyoung people as vulnerable or victimised focused official attention on their welfare \nneeds, constructions of them as responsible, morally culpable and blame worthy \nconcentrated attention on punishment. And in keeping with these contradictory \nunderstandings, policies have vacillated between those adopting primarily an \nexclusionary strategy (care, incarceration, and so on) and those adopting primarily an \ninclusionary strategy (welfare provision, fostering and adoption, community punishments \nand so on). However, three years into the new millennium, such a simple characterisation \nof youth justice policies and practice is no longer adequate. Muncie and Hughes (2002) \nhave noted that in the last two decades youth justice is shaped by a more \u201ehybrid\u201f agenda. \nOther ideologies, rhetorics and strategies have emerged that impact both on how the age-\nold contradiction between care and control takes specific form and the extent to which \nthat contradiction drives and shapes actual policies and practice. Importantly, the \n 6 \nemergence of corporatism and managerialism with their respective strategies of multi-\nagency (or inter-agency) work and risk assessment has fundamentally altered the \nprovision of youth justice (Muncie and Hughes 2002, Pratt 2002, Pitts 2003, Smith \n2003). Accordingly, Muncie and Hughes (2002) and others suggest that the \ncontradictions of care and control, protection and punishment have been displaced, or \nmore precisely rendered less relevant because the capacity of corporatism and \nmanagerialism is such that it has all but silenced philosophical and political discussion \nabout the purpose of punishment or welfare and analyzes of both the causal factors of \nlawbreaking and the mechanisms to \u201enormalise\u201f the young person. Instead the focus of \npolicies and agencies dealing with young lawbreakers turns to managing the \u201erisks\u201f of re-\noffending they pose to the wider community (Newburn 2002) and ensuring \ncommunication between the different agencies (i.e. social services, youth offending \nteams, voluntary organisations, youth court panels, and so on). \nAt the same time as the contradiction between welfare and punishment has been \ndisplaced, commentators on youth justice have also noted the expansion of youth justice \npolicies into other areas such that there has been a creeping criminalisation of social \npolicy where youth is concerned (Muncie 1999, Smith 2001). Thus, for instance, the \nCrime and Disorder Act 1998 has criminalised behaviours and activities that are not, in \nfact, infractions of penal codes (i.e. \u201eanti-social behaviour\u201f) and extended the capacity of \ncriminal justice to penetrate deeper into the lives of people and their families and has \nultimately drawn on non-criminal justice agencies to do the work of youth justice (i.e. \neducation and social work). Parenting orders, child safety orders, anti-social behaviour \norders, local child curfews, acceptable behaviour contracts and so on do not require \n 7 \ncriminal adjudication just as the identification of those \u201eat risk\u201f of \u201ebeing at risk of \noffending\u201f does not require that the young person actually commits any offence. In yet \nother examples, the rhetoric of child protection and family support clouds the issue of \njustice and blurs the boundaries between criminal justice and other welfare agencies as \nfamilies (and especially parents) are compelled to take \u201eproper\u201f care of their youngsters \nin order to halt the process by which they might become offenders (or be held \nresponsible). Underpinning these changes has been the drive to manage troubling \npopulations through the quantification of risks of \u201ere-offending\u201f, the focus on preventing \nyouth crime and the drawing together of a range of both criminal justice and other \nagencies to identify, survey, control and work with potentially lawbreaking young people \n(Smith 2001, Kempf-Leonard & Petersen 2002).  \nAnd so, five years since the inception of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, it has \nbecome more commonplace to discuss youth justice as comprised of a hybrid agenda in \nwhich it is possible to contain both the demand for punishment and the desire to care \nthrough the ideology of managerialism. As Muncie and Hughes write: \u201eManagerialism, \nbecause it has no higher purpose, may be the only available thread that can tie the \ncontradictory, the volatile and the inconsistent together. No reading of the future can ever \nbe clear. The logics of welfare paternalism, justice and rights, responsibilisation, \nremoralisation, authoritarianism and managerialism will continue their \u201edance\u201f and new \nspaces for resistance, relational politics and governmental innovation will be opened up\u201f \n(Muncie and Hughes 2002:16).  \n Understanding changes in the nature of youth governance in such a fashion is \nmuch more than mere characterisation offering an illuminating set of references points \n 8 \nonto which specific interventions, policy changes and practice developments can be \nmapped: it is, instead, a framework in which policy and practice in the area of youth \njustice can be analyzed and examined. Specifically, the rhetoric, ideology and practices \nassociated with the broader strategies and discourses of paternalism, welfarism, justice, \nmanagerialism and so on are conceptualised as being both a set of resources and \nstrategies that can be deployed to justify and generate interventions as well as discourses \nthat shape and give form to those interventions. And, accordingly, the specificities of \nactual practice are thus explained as being as much as result of the local arrangements \nbrokered between agencies as they are the result of broader socio-economic forces and \npolitical conditions.  \nNotwithstanding the usefulness of Muncie\u201fs and Hughes\u201f suggestions, the \n\u201ehybridity\u201f to which they refer and the \u201edance\u201f that is implied is not quite as uncertain as \nis inferred. There are discernible patterns. It is one of these patterns that this paper \naddresses. Examining the changes to the ways that young people in prostitution have \nbeen treated in the last three years affords an insight into the ways that the separation \nbetween punishment and protection is becoming muddy and blurred. In this paper, I \nargue that the ideology of managerialism allows welfare and punishment to co-exist in a \ndifferent way than was previously seen. It is not simply the case that protection is given \nto those who can be understood as \u201ein need\u201f or \u201eat risk\u201f whereas punishment was left for \nthose who more neatly fit the discourse of youthful offending, or even as suggested by \nSmith (2001) that the demands of control and management take precedence over welfare \nconcerns (and vice versa). Instead, I want to suggest that the key strategy of \nmanagerialism (i.e. risk assessment) allows for a growing encroachment into welfare \n 9 \nagendas of a punitive response and, almost satirically, punishment gets re-interpreted and \nre-constituted as welfare. Let me be clear: it is not just that via multi-agency working the \ndifferent agencies and agendas are moving closer to each other \u2013 rather that underpinning \nwelfare is punishment; when a \u201ewelfare-based\u201f intervention fails, punishment is never far \nbehind. Just as the centrality of incarceration has yet to be displaced in the face of an \nincreasing range of disposals, so to incarceration underpins the welfare protection offered \nto some young people (in this instance, young prostitutes) whose lives, already torn apart \nby the aggregate effects of poverty, anti-youth social policies and so on, are increasingly \ndefined as toxic and in need of intervention\n2\n. And, underpinning punishment is a rhetoric \nof protection and welfare. In the next section, I describe the innovations to young \nprostitution policies that have occurred in the UK in order to set the context for the \nanalysis and argument that follows. \n \nSAFEGUARDING CHILDREN INVOLVED IN PROSTITUTION \n \nIn March 2000, the Department of Health and Home Office jointly issued \nSafeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution (SCIP) and appended it to Working \nTogether to Safeguard Children (which informs all Local Authorities and other agencies \nworking with children how the Children Act 1989 should be implemented). SCIP advised \nthat the involvement of children\n3\n in prostitution should no longer been seen as a simple \nmatter of offending; that it should be seen, in the first instance, as an indication that a \n                                                 \n2 Nearly two decades of empirical research describe young people\u201fs (and especially young girls) involvement in \nprostitution as being one of many survival strategies for those who are outwith education, training and the family, \nexperiencing poverty and the almost complete foreclosure of other possibilities for economic and social security (cf. \nPhoenix 2001, O\u201fNeill 2000, Pearce 2003, Melrose, Barret and Brodie 19??) \n3 SCIP defines \u201echildren\u201f as anyone under the age of 18 years old.  \n 10 \nyoung person could be \u201eat risk\u201f of significant harm if not already suffering from abuse. \nAs such, SCIP informed agencies that there exists a statutory obligation to: (i) treat these \nchildren as victims (and not offenders); (ii) safeguard and promote their welfare; (iii) \nwork together to create \u201eexit strategies\u201f; and, (iv) use the full force of the criminal law \nagainst those who would exploit, coerce, induce, or compel young people in the course of \ntheir involvement in prostitution. It is important to note that unlike other changes in youth \njustice, SCIP did not create or put in place new law. It also did not decriminalize \nprostitution for the under 18 year olds. It merely sought to re-focus the energies and \nattentions of, primarily, criminal justice and welfare agencies in order that the criminal \nlaw was not used against young people in prostitution in the first instance, and to change \nthe direction of what was perceived to be common practice (i.e. the arrest, caution or \nprosecution and punishment of young people for prostitution-related offences).  \n Elsewhere I have discussed the problematic understandings of young people\u201fs \ninvolvement in prostitution that shaped SCIP and for the purposes of this article only a \nbrief summary is needed\n4\n. SCIP transposed the problem of young people\u201fs involvement \nin prostitution into a \u201eproblem\u201f of child (sexual) abuse. It did this by re-defining what the \n\u201ereal\u201f problem of youth prostitution is and who the \u201ereal\u201f criminals are. The real problem, \nwe were informed, is neither the social and material privations nor the devastated \nfinancial and emotional lives that makes involvement in prostitution not only possible but \nplausible and at times \u201eattractive\u201f for some young people. Nor is it the lawbreaking \nbehaviour of such young people. Instead, the \u201ereal\u201f problem of youth prostitution is that it \nis a manifestation of their victimization at the hands of unscrupulous men. The \u201ereal\u201f \n                                                 \n4 See \u201eIn the Name of Protection: Youth Prostitution Policy Reforms in England and Wales\u201f, Critical Social Policy, vol \n22(2), May 2000 \n 11 \ncriminals, thus, are not the young people who may be breaking the law by soliciting or \nloitering, but the men who target homeless, vulnerable, damaged young lives for their \nown pecuniary gain. SCIP directed justice agencies and the Local Authorities that \ntraditional criminal justice work, thus, should be re-directed to arresting and prosecuting \nthe \u201ereal\u201f criminals who commit the \u201ereal\u201f crimes. One impact of constructing the \nproblem of youth prostitution in this fashion, however, is that the social and economic \nrealities of many of these young people\u201fs lives are simply erased. Young people, whose \neconomic and social stability has been damaged by two decades of social policies that \nexcluded them from the labour market, welfare benefits and made them blameworthy for \ntheir less than law-abiding survival strategies, are in one deft movement, symbolically \ntransformed into victims of abuse\n5\n. That said, the guidance was very specific in asserting \nthat not all young people in prostitution are victims of coercion. Some are involved in \nprostitution voluntarily. For these young people, who are constituted as also being \u201ereal\u201f \noffenders, criminal justice intervention is deemed appropriate. \n Following on from this guidance document, Britain has seen the formalisation of \nwhat could be called a youth prostitution policy. The guidance forced all Local \nAuthorities within England and Wales to adopt protocols and local agreements that detail \nexactly how young people in prostitution will be dealt with (i.e. where and how referrals \nare processed, the mechanisms through which multi-agency work will progress and who \ntakes the lead in what type of investigation and so on). Key children\u201fs organisations in \nScotland and Northern Ireland as well as the Scottish Executive have followed suit and, \n                                                 \n5\n To be clear, I am not suggesting that young people in prostitution are not victims of abuse. I am merely arguing that \nSCIP offered a totalizing understanding of them as always, already and only victims.  \n 12 \nat the time of writing this article, are investigating applying this approach within their \nown constituencies.  \nDespite the suggestion in SCIP that local authorities were free to implement \nwhatever type of approach they felt was best given the local conditions, a de facto \nnational model of intervention emerged. In constituting the problem of youth prostitution \nas being a problem of child abuse a method of intervention suggested itself. In the \nprocess of implementing SCIP, most local authorities simply \u201egrafted\u201f the issue of youth \nprostitution onto their already established multi-agency protocols and procedures for \nchild protection work. Youth prostitution was dealt with as though it was \u201ejust\u201f another \nchild protection issue in which social services, relevant voluntary organisation and the \npolice worked together to ensure the safety and security of children.  \n And still the story does not end there, because unlike abuse within the family, \nyouth prostitution is not \u201ejust\u201f another child protection issue. As indicated earlier, SCIP \ndid not challenge or displace older understandings of young people\u201fs involvement in \nprostitution. SCIP included a \u201epersistent\u201f and \u201evoluntary-returner\u201f section which enabled \npolice to arrest and prosecute those young people who, it was felt, had not been coerced \ninto prostitution and engaged in it of their own free will\n6\n. Because SCIP invoked a very \nparticular notion of coercion (in which the individual has no capacity to act otherwise), \nvoluntarism was constituted as being little more than the free will to make other choices, \nto act otherwise. SCIP made official a binary construction of young people in prostitution \nas either victims or offenders. Victims are those who are coerced, abused and exploited; \n                                                 \n6\n Examination of Home Office statistics for prosecution for prostitution related offences would indicate that \nprosecutions of the under 14 year old age group has remained in the region of 0 \u2013 2 per year since the start of the 1990s. \nProsecutions for the 15 \u2013 17 year old age group however shows a dramatic decline throughout the decade of the 1990s \nfrom in the area of 300 per year to around 20 per year. That said, data collected as part of the examination of national \nprovision indicates that there is an increasing demand for arrest, prosecution and punishment for prostitution-related \noffences as police and social services \u201close faith\u201d that any welfare-based intervention will succeed. \n 13 \noffenders are those who could have made other choices. With that, two very different \nformal modes of intervention and regulation (i.e. child protection and youth justice) were \ninterlocked: one multi-agency group oversaw the process of adjudicating who were to be \noffered protection as victims and what interventions were \u201ein their best interests\u201f and who \nwere to be punished as offenders.  \nIn practice, SCIP and the protocols that have followed put in place a method of \nworking wherein once a concern is noted by police, social services or an involved \nvoluntary organisation (i.e. a drug or youth agency, a sexual health outreach service, a \nchildren\u201fs organisation and so on) that a young person is (or might be) engaged in \nprostitution, a multi-agency group is convened to discuss the matter. The multi-agency \ngroup usually comprises social services, the police and any voluntary organisation that \nmight be involved. The meeting is designed to share information, to discuss concerns \n(which often mean discussing issues of responsibility and risk) and adopt a strategy for \nworking with the young person (usually young girl).  \nIn the next section, I detail some of the ways that issues of \u201erisk\u201f and \n\u201eresponsibility\u201f have been discussed by police, social services and voluntary \norganisations. In so doing, I argue that it is precisely the multi-agency approach that \ncreates the conditions in which the risks that young people in prostitution are exposed to \nare \u201etransformed\u201f into risks to the agencies and the \u201eresponsibilities\u201f that agencies have \nfor their young charges are \u201etransformed\u201f into responsibilities that the young people have \nto leave prostitution. This argument is derived from analysis of the lack of consensus \nbetween members of various multi-agency forums regarding the meanings of these two \nkey terms.  \n 14 \n \nRISK OF WHAT, TO WHOM? \n \n There are only 41 specialist projects in the UK that deal with young people in \nprostitution and the majority of these are located within the voluntary sector. They are \ngeographically clustered such that the majority of services are located in England in the \nNortheast and Southeast with a few in the Midlands and the Southwest. In areas where \nthere are no specialist organisations, work with young people in prostitution is conducted \n(usually) via the police, youth offending teams and social services and comes under the \njurisdiction of the Community Safety or Crime and Disorder Partnerships. Interviews \nwith those who have experience of working with young people in prostitution showed \nthat there was little agreement about either the best way of working with this group of \npeople or the most appropriate type of interventions. Notwithstanding this, interviews \nshowed that there was an overall agreement that working with young prostitutes was \ninherently risky. Young prostitutes were seen as posing a risk in the form of liability to \nthe organisation itself\n7. For, in locating the \u201eproblem\u201f of youth prostitution in childrens\u201f \nwelfare services and only partly removing it from youth justice, SCIP has placed a legal \nobligation of protection upon a wide range of welfare and justice agencies without \nproviding any new or extra resources to be able to supply that protection. Quite simply, \nthere was no new money for this extra work. The complex social, psychological and \nwelfare needs of young people in prostitution just became one of the many competing \n                                                 \n7\n It should be noted that the majority of young people who come to the attention of the police, social services or \nspecialist organisations for their involvement in prostitution are: (i) girls; (ii) \u201etypical\u201f in that their histories are marked \nby poverty, being in and out of Local Authority Care and experiencing abuse as well as having drug and alcohol \nproblems in the present and a strong desire for independent living; (iii) \u201eusually\u201f between 15 and 17 years old (although \nsome projects are noting slighting younger girls); (iv) prostituting from the streets. \n 15 \ndemands placed upon the various agencies. The exception to this was the 41 voluntary \norganisations that were set up and funded specifically to work with young prostitutes. For \nthem, the risk of liability was straightforward: failure to exit their young charges from \nprostitution was evidence of failure of the organisation itself.  \n In this context, multi-agency work takes on very specific and different meanings \nfor each organisation taking part. In general, multi-agency work meant \u201esharing\u201f the \nliability.  \nYou have to work collaboratively with young prostitutes so that it\u201fs not just us \nthat\u201fs carrying the can (VOLUNTARY ORGANISATION)  \n \nFor me, my agenda was more around how do we share the risk because that \nbecomes such an essential issue between agencies when you\u201fre working with the \nyoung person where there are really scary issue like prostitution. (POLICE) \n \nVoluntary organisations and statutory agencies differed on what they saw as the \nimportance of multi-agency work. Voluntary organisations were ambivalent about it. \nWhilst there was a notion that they were able to share responsibility for the young people \nwith the police and social services, there was also the feeling that too much was expected \nfrom them.  \n \nThe protocols do mean, I don't know whether this is real or imagined, but it feels \nvery often that we are carrying a lot of risk that maybe a statutory sector agency \nought to be carrying. (VOLUNTARY ORGANISATION) \n \nFor me the reforms are all about making an agreement that we have a procedure \nby which agencies share the idea they\u201fre going to live with the risk, so that we\u201fre \nnot in a position that one agency is going to get shafted should things go wrong. \n(VOLUNTARY ORGANISATION) \n \nIf I had a penny for every time that a police officer or social worker told me that \nchild protection was not rocket science, I would be a rich woman by now. But it is \n 16 \neasy for them, they do not have to carry the burden of knowing that if things go \nwrong, they\u201fll get the blame. (VOLUNTARY ORGANISATION) \n \nFor social services, multi-agency work meant being able to tap into the resources of \nvoluntary organisations and share information about specific young people. \nNotwithstanding this, voluntary organisations have continually complained that such \n\u201einformation sharing\u201f usually meant a one-way demand to give information placed upon \nthem, with very little given back. When such \u201esharing\u201f was not forthcoming, the police \nand social services could invoke Section 47 of the Children Act 1989 to oblige other \nagencies to share information.  \n \nOne officer told me he would prosecute me unless I told him everything I knew \nabout one of the young women I work with. He said because it was a child \nprotection issue, I had to. (VOLUNTARY ORGANSIATION) \n \nFor me, we brought in a voluntary organisation as a third party because there was \n(and probably still would be if we hadn\u201ft brought them in) a lot of bickering and \nthat bickering was about feelings of impotence on the part of the agencies (police \nand social services) and to perhaps shift responsibility to another agency. \n(SOCIAL SERVICES) \n \nInterestingly, one of the difficulties voluntary organisations discussed was how \u201esharing\u201f \ninformation with police and social services jeopardised their outreach work. One \nvoluntary worker recounted a tale about a young woman who worked as a prostitute in a \nparlour and when she revealed that she was only 15 years old. The worker (who worked \nwith a sexual health outreach service) made the decision to inform social services and the \npolice. As a result of this, the voluntary worker is now denied access by the owners to a \nnumber of parlours in the area and by extension to the women working within them.  \n 17 \nAs practice has developed in the last three years, voluntary organisations are re-\ndefining what they understand as the \u201eproblem\u201f of youth prostitution in ways that enable \nthem to avoid issues of liability to the organisation and the compulsion to share \ninformation. Specifically, many voluntary projects are now invoking a concept of \n\u201eimmediate danger\u201f to distinguish between cases that need to be referred to the police and \nsocial services and those that do not. This enables them to continue to offer a confidential \nservice and only report cases in which young girls are at risk of death or extreme harm or \nviolence. \n \nBLURRED BOUNDARIES \n \nYouth prostitution presents many difficulties for practitioners, not least of which is \nthat such work occurs, literally, at the margins of both child protection and youth justice. \nIn not decriminalising prostitution-related offences for the under 18 year olds, and by \nformalising the distinction between those who are involved in prostitution as a result of \nabuse and those who \u201evoluntarily\u201f engage in it, the Department of Health and Home \nOffice created a framework of policy and practice which locates the issue of youth \nprostitution in both welfare and justice agencies. Therefore, unlike other issues that are \ndealt with via a multi-agency approach, youth prostitution multi-agency work necessarily \ninvolves working with the contradiction of care and control, welfare and punishment. In \nso doing, the conditions are created in which the boundaries between welfare and \npunishment blur. \n 18 \nIn the sections that follow, I detail the ways in which the distinction between those \nyoung people who are thought of as needing protection and those understood as \nappropriate subject of punishment breaks down in practice. Subsequent to this, I outline \nthe ways that \u201ewelfare-based\u201f interventions are buttress by punishment and the ways that \npunishment is re-constructed as \u201ewelfare\u201f. Underpinning this, however, is the perceived \ndemand placed on workers to be ever vigilant in limiting the risk of liability to the \norganisation that young people in prostitution posed.  \n \nToo Little, Too Late \n \n Despite the diversity of understanding about multi-agency work held by its \nmembers, the majority of those who have had experience in working with 15, 16, 17 year \nolds in prostitution agreed that whilst it is better not to criminalise this group of young \npeople, the welfare interventions that have been put in place do little to help them leave \nprostitution. One sexual health outreach worker in the south of England reported that the \nagency knows of two girls who prostitute in order to feed their mother\u201fs crack habit. \nTime and again the police pick these girls up and simply return them to their homes. \nSocial services claimed there is little more that can be done because the girls have already \nbeen placed in residential care. More commonly, voluntary organisation workers \nrecounted the dire lack of suitable accommodation for teenagers, the long waiting lists for \ndrug treatment and the incongruence between the services that can be provided and the \nchaotic nature of these young people\u201fs lives. This was so much so the case that many \norganisations talked about social services and the police \u201cdragging their feet\u201d when the \n 19 \nyoung woman was 17 years old; instead opting to wait until she was 18 years old so that \nthey could deal with her through the standard criminal justice route of arrest, prosecution \nand punishment.  \nWhilst such inaction might appear cynical to the outsider, it must be understood in \na context in which most organisations (including the police) recognised that there was \nvery little that could be done for most young people in prostitution. The key method of \nworking was to \u201ework with where the young person was at\u201f which meant, in practice, to \noffer advocacy, counselling, self-esteem and self-confidence building\n8\n. This form of \nintervention was structured partly by the lack of additional resources given to Local \nAuthorities for youth prostitution and also by the explanation for it put forward SCIP. \nNotwithstanding this, working with where the young person is \u201cat\u201d rebounded on the \norganisation, if only because such methods and approaches cannot address the extreme \nsocial and economic problems experienced by most young people in prostitution. Such an \nincongruence between \u201chelp\u201d offered and the realities of prostitution for most young \npeople can, arguably, create the very conditions for their persistent return thereby \ngenerating more liability risks for the agency. In this context, sustained involvement by \nany one agency with a specific young person soon saw agencies re-focusing attention on \nthe motivation of the young person.  \n                                                 \n8 Other help offered included helping young people secure housing, negotiating with family and helping the young \npeople \u201eexpress\u201f themselves. In one case, a worker informed me that the agency she worked with which specialized in \nworking with young people who are being sexually exploited discovered that one of their charges enjoyed dancing. As \na response, they helped her enroll in Scottish Dancing classes. As valuable as dancing classes may be to self-esteem \nand self-confidence it does little to address the social and structural issues funneling some young people\u201fs choices. \n 20 \n \nVictim, Offender and the adjudication of motivation \n \nIn framing the problem of youth prostitution as either a problem of \u201eabuse\u201f \n(wherein young people are coerced into prostitution) or \u201ecrime\u201f (wherein young people \npersistently and voluntarily continue to be involved in prostitution), SCIP created a \npolicy that can only result in a focus on the motivation of young people. Did they, or did \nthey not, consent to their involvement? As practice has developed however, social \nworkers and voluntary project workers have attempted to displace the view that a young \nperson involved in prostitution may chose to do so by challenging any simplistic notion \nof \u201econsent\u201f. So, for instance, some voluntary project workers, and specifically sexual \nhealth outreach workers, described that much of the work that they have to do in the \nmulti-agency meetings involves detailed discussion of how the choices that young people \nmake are \u201ctoo crowded by other issues\u201d to allow them to make \u201ereasoned or rationale\u201d \nchoices. \nNotwithstanding this, where young girls \u201epersistently\u201f failed to respond to the best \nefforts of agencies and where they were regularly picked up by police officers, the \nadjudication of motivation can lead directly to criminalisation if the agencies feel that girl \nis voluntarily involved in prostitution. Whilst many workers talked at length about the \nneed to avoid making any \u201csnap judgements\u201d and the necessity to ensure that all possible \navenues have been explored, there was also discussion that at some point it is important \nto \u201cdraw the line\u201d with some young people and recognise that occasionally, whilst toxic, \nsome young people do, voluntarily, engage in prostitution. When asked about what \n 21 \ncriteria they would use to make such determination, practitioners discussed both the \nyoung people\u201fs \u201epersistent return\u201f to prostitution and the associated failure to \u201eexit\u201f as \nwell as other factors that seemingly have little to do with the actual lives in prostitution of \nthe young girls. (Of course, this is an irony that ensures that agencies can never \u201efail\u201f - \nand thereby avoid the risk of liability. If a young girl does not leave prostitution, then by \ndefinition she must be voluntarily involved). The extra-prostitution factors that \npractitioners identified as \u201cevidence\u201d of voluntarism included: age, demeanour and \nrecalcitrance. Seventeen year olds were much more likely to been seen as understanding \nthe choices that they made and thus, by inference, involved in prostitution voluntarily. \nOther practitioners recounted having to fight against the views held by some statutory \nagencies (i.e. social services) that once a girl turns 16 years old, it is her choice to be \ninvolved in prostitution or that \u201cif they don\u201ft want stop then we can\u201ft help them\u201d. \nLikewise, those young people who did not easily \u201cfit\u201d the stereotype of either an abused \nchild or coerced victim were also likely to be seen as voluntarily involved. Here, \npractitioners talked about \u201cmouthy\u201d young women, \u201cspitting and swearing and kicking \nout\u201d, \u201cnot wanting help\u201d and \u201cgoing straight back to the beat\u201d. \n \nThere\u201fs a dilemma here because if you have got a 17 year old that has made the \nlife choice and that is the way they choose to go on behalf of themselves then \nthere has to be a point where you way, well hang on a minute, this person is \nactually not a victim, this person is an offender. (SOCIAL SERVICES) \n \nBut we're also very well aware of the realities of the street and that, you know, \nthat the protocols don't say NEVER arrest these young people, the protocols say \ndon't arrest them as a first course. Find out what they're lives are like first and \nwhy they are in prostitution. (VOLUNTARY ORG) \n \n 22 \n At the risk of repetition, young people aged 15 \u2013 17 years old are precisely the \nyoung people in prostitution who are most likely to come into contact with police, social \nservices and voluntary organisations for their involvement in prostitution if only because \nthey are likely to be doing street based prostitution and have problems with drugs. Much \nyounger age groups tend to work in less visible ways. Pearce (2003) reported that 12 \u2013 14 \nyear old girls who did not identify as \u201eprostitutes\u201f nevertheless were at risk of sexual \nexploitation because of the ways in which they \u201eget into men\u201fs cars\u201f and exchanged sex \nfor other things, such as a roof for the night, drinks in a bar and so on. More than this, it \nis also the 15 \u2013 17 year old age group who are more likely to have already been involved \nin social services and who are also more likely to act in less \u201ccooperative ways\u201d because \nof both their previous experiences of statutory interventions and their (usual) desire for \nindependence (cf. Phoenix 2001, Carlen 1996). The point here is that the majority of \nyoung girls in prostitution that agencies do come into contact with are specifically ths \nmost troubling and \u201erisky\u201f (to the organisation) group of 15 \u2013 17 year olds. \nIt is in this situation that the distinction drawn in SCIP between those voluntarily \ninvolved in prostitution and those who needed \u201chelp\u201d breaks down in practice. Helping a \nyoung person with \u201cwhere they are at\u201d does little or nothing to address the complexities \nof how the young person makes sense of their involvement in prostitution and the almost \ncomplete lack of options that young people have for their own economic and social \nsecurity and stability. And, in so doing, the very interventions put in place to \u201chelp\u201d \nyoung people in prostitution set the scene for the agencies to \u201cadmit failure\u201d and re-\nconstruct their young charges as voluntarily involved in prostitution. Here, \u201ewelfare-\n 23 \nbased\u201f interventions rapidly bleed into the more punitive responses of criminalisation as \nagencies struggle to determine just what to do with these older, young people. \n \nExtreme Risks: when protection becomes punishment \n \n The exception to \u201cworking with where the young person is at\u201d is when the girl\u201fs \ninvolvement in prostitution was judged to be \u201etoo heavy\u201f and thus a more \u201eextreme \nintervention\u201f was needed. When asked about what \u201etoo heavy\u201f meant, practitioners were \nin agreement: too heavy meant that involvement in prostitution was often accompanied \nby the extreme abuse of the young person from (typically) an older man, was associated \nwith a heavy involvement or dependency on drugs and\/or where the involvement in \nprostitution was imbricated with organised crime. For instance, in one locality, \npractitioners talked about a group of organised, older, criminal men who traded guns and \ndrugs, dominated and \u201cpimped\u201d young girls from the \u201ebeat\u201f and would even \u201cpass them \naround to be raped\u201d. In these \u201eextreme\u201f cases, practitioners also talked about their fears of \nbeing \u201cthe one who has a child death on their hands\u201d and the way in which this would \ncompromise the ability of the organisation to continue to do the work that they do. This \nwas especially pertinent in areas where there were notable tensions between the different \nagencies or where there had not been a long history of trusting relationships between the \nvoluntary and statutory sectors. And when these \u201eextreme\u201f cases occurred, practitioners \nfelt the only real option for ensuring the safety of the young girls was placing them in \nsecure accommodation.  \n 24 \nMost practitioners who were interviewed recognised that secure accommodation \ndid not tackle the poverty and social instability that often brought about specific young \npeople\u201fs involvement in prostitution. Instead, secure accommodation provided the multi-\nagency group with a means to displace the burden of \u201ccarrying the risk\u201d. In this sense, \nsecure accommodation was used primarily as a strategy for ensuring \u201esafety\u201f for both the \nyoung person and the organisation. That this happened is, of course, not surprising. \nWhere the perceived risk is of life and death, social services, police and voluntary \norganisations must act. In a context where there are little or no resources and no effective \nway of addressing the structural issues that lead young people into prostitution, secure \naccommodation does become a useful strategy in blame avoidance.  \nFor the purposes of this article, the importance of securing young people in \nprostitution does not necessarily inhere in the wider questions of its \u201esuccess\u201f or \n\u201eeffectiveness\u201f as an exit plan. Rather, the importance inheres in the way that often the \nonly practical strategy at the disposal of voluntary and statutory services is the \nintervention in which we see the distinction between punishment and protection most \nprofoundly dissolved. Young people placed in secure accommodation \u201cfor their \nprotection\u201d (and the protection of the agency) are often placed in the exact same \ninstitutions as those young people who are secured for punishment.  And, recent research \ninto secure accommodation has detailed the many and various ways that the welfare \nneeds of young people are systematically sidelined in favour of the security and \ncontainment demands placed upon the institution to achieve its punitive purpose for some \nof its charges (Goldson 2002, O\u201fNeill 2002). In short, the primary purpose of secure \naccommodation is to curtail the liberty and contain the young people placed there. Hence, \n 25 \nin cases that constitute what could be called the extreme edge of child protection (i.e. \nthreats to life), the intervention offered is often punitive. Young girls are offered \nprotection through the punishing regimes of being incarcerated in secure accommodation.  \n \nThe issue for us is do we go for, we have had a number of situations where we\u201fve \nhad to use Secure because they have been very life threatening situations and we \ndon\u201ft want a death on our hands. (SOCIAL SERVICES) \n \nWe do use secure accommodation \u2013 not that much and I wonder if we should use \nit more. Anyway, this one girl we secured twice in one year. The first time she \nhad about three months secure. But as soon as she was back here, she was back on \nthe scene. She ended up asking us to give her more secure. (SOCIAL SERVICES) \n \nThe only way I can see anything getting done is that we've got to remove this girl \nfrom where she is. They removed her to a B&B which just happens to be right in \nthe middle of it and it just seemed a nonsense to me\u2026 At the end of the day, we \nargued over secure accommodation and that's social services advice for her - and \nit is through their bosses and legal department coz they've got to get funding and \nthen they've got to find a bed and they were saying we haven't got anything, we've \ngot no staff and no funding. But they found somewhere. But in the interim, we're \ngoing to arrest her for police protection and then we've got 72 hours until the \nsocial service come in and of course we must hand it over to them. But al least we \nwill see that she's OK and when we got for 72 hours secure accommodation social \nservice can then go for 4 or 3 months. (POLICE - CPT) \n \n \nPolicing the streets: when punishment is protection \n \n So far I have detailed how both voluntary organisations and social services \nblurred the boundaries between protection and punishment in the ways that they \nunderstand and construct the liability risks posed to the organisation by young people in \nprostitution. The police, however, constituted the risks they face by young people in \nprostitution slightly differently. For them, the liability posed by young prostitutes was the \n 26 \nworry that any visible presence of young prostitutes in the area would cause increased \ncommunity demands to \u201cclean up the streets\u201d. And, more than this, the presence of young \nprostitutes generated a fear among senior police officers that the level of prostitution-\nrelated problems in the not-too-distant future would also increase. Therefore, there was \nthe need \u201cto be seen to be doing something about it [i.e. prostitution]\u201d by removing, \nreducing or displacing the visible presence of young people in prostitution.  \nIt is in this context that there is a third and final blurring of the boundaries \nbetween protection and punishment. For, in order to avoid the liability risks posed by \nyouth prostitution, senior officers talked about the need to continue with more traditional \nmethods of arrest and prosecution in order to \u201cprotect\u201d themselves from complaints and, \nmore pertinently to this article, \u201cprotect\u201d the young people from involvement in \nprostitution. It is here that we see a creeping welfarisation of punishment as \u201epunishment\u201f \ncomes to be understood as one in a host of strategies that will ensure the greater welfare, \nsafety, security and well-being of the young person. Ironically, punishing young girls in \nprostitution was seen as providing \u201eprotection\u201f for them now as well as \u201eprotection\u201f for a \nfuture generation of young women.  \n \nEnforcement on its own won't work and neither will support services on their own \nbecause these girls won't just go along and say I want to get out of prostitution - \nyou've got to make it happen. So I've been looking at using ASBO for prostitutes. \nI've got no option particularly the way that things are going at the moment - the \nrapes, the murder, the assaults on prostitutes, the kidnaps. It's a form of \nprotection. I think we've got to enforce the issue and force them off the streets. \n(POLICE) \n \nThis is a long term strategy to help exit young people by using all the multi-\nagencies and if you have less young people on the streets involved in prostitution, \nnow you'll have less prostitution long term. Bearing in mind that each one of the \n 27 \ngirls is a role model to another girl or more than hat. So if you take one girl out of \nprostitution, it\u201fs like removing 5. (POLICE)  \n \nMore routinely, however, police officers who had had experience working with \nyoung people in prostitution, including those doing child protection work, talked about \narrest and police harassment as an \u201eexit strategy\u201f. The logic was simple: the more a young \nperson is arrested and the more difficult their involvement in prostitution becomes, the \nharder it is for that young person to voluntarily return to prostitution.  Again, it would be \neasy to be overly cynical about such logic and accuse the police of \u201einsensitivity\u201f or a \nlack of understanding. Against such an accusation, however, is the reality that the police \nhave few other resources at their disposal; they use what strategies they have in their \nendeavours to discharge their obligation of care for this particular group of young people. \nWhat must be borne in mind is that it is the youth justice and prostitution policies \nthemselves that shape this particular blurred boundary. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe argument put forward in this article is that discussions about the shifting and \nchanging nature of youth justice have, perhaps, overplayed the ways in which care and \ncontrol have been displaced in youth justice and underplayed the ways that \nmanagerialism and corporatism have created structures that allow the contradiction to \naccommodated. By focussing on work at the margins of youth justice and child protection \ninsight is generated into how a punitive response becomes one of the ways in which \nprotection is exacted and vice versa. So, in relation to young prostitutes, the ideology of \n 28 \nmanagerialism and structure of the multi-agency group focuses attention on clearly \nidentifying issues of risk to the agency. In this way a group of young girls originally \ndefined as posing a risk to themselves, quickly become seen as a risk to others (i.e. the \nagencies) and with that protection of the girls is translated into protection of the agencies. \nAnd, when faced with these liabilities and no resources or means of dealing with the \ncomplex problems associated with involvement in prostitution, organisations use what \nresources they do possess. The result is simple: protection is administered through \nincarceration and punishment gets symbolically transformed into welfare; and with that, \nthe contradiction at the heart of this work becomes not so contradictory.  \nIt is possible that the case of youth prostitution is unique. However, I would \nsuggest that the creeping criminalisation of social policy vis-\u00e0-vis youth and the way that \nnon-criminal justice, and specifically welfare, agencies are increasingly being tied in with \nthe work of youth justice agencies creates the conditions in which there will be a more \nwide-spread instances of security-oriented welfare and punishment for the \u201egood\u201f of the \nyoung people. \n \nBibliography \n \nBrown, S.
