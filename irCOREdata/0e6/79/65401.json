On numerous occasions, Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and \nhis Foreign Secretary Joschka Fischer emphasised the importance of Holocaust \ncentred memory for the identity of the Federal Republic.\n1\n  \nIn an interview, Schr\u00f6der made it very clear that Germany\u201fs history between 1933 and \n1945 was irrevocably part of German national identity: \u201eThe past can neither be \nundone nor can it be overcome. But one can learn from history and that is what we \nGermans have done. \u2026 Memory of the National Socialist period, of war, genocide \nand crime has become part of our national identity.\u201f2 Two key initiatives which came \nto fruition under the Schr\u00f6der government illustrate this acceptance very well: the \ncompletion of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin and the \ncompensation for forced labour which was at last settled under the red-green \ncoalition. \nIn contrast to the traditional approach of the political left, this uncompromising \nacceptance of Germany\u201fs historical legacy was not to result in what had been termed \n\u201enegative nationalism\u201f. The red-green government\u201fs approach arguably represented a \nsymbiosis of previous approaches resulting in more assertiveness and positive \nnationalism in spite of or maybe even because of acknowledging Germany\u201fs National \nSocialist past and its crimes and the responsibility that emerged from it for later \ngenerations. \nAlready early on in Schr\u00f6der\u201fs chancellorship it became very clear that he adopted a \nvery pragmatic approach to the German past and the role it should play in united \nGermany\u201fs national identity. In a talk show in November 1998 Schr\u00f6der described the \nGermany he was planning to represent as \u201eless inhibited\u201f and \u201ein a positive sense \nmaybe even more German\u201f.3 With this, Schr\u00f6der depicted something quite without \ntradition in post-45 German history: to be \u201emore German\u201f in a \u201epositive sense\u201f in spite \nof acknowledging German historical responsibility for the crimes committed between \n1933 and 1945. Until then, positive expressions of German national identity had either \nbeen impossible because of Auschwitz, as the liberal left had tended to argue, or had \nrelied on a relativisation of the Holocaust in order to sustain themselves.\n4\n  \nIn his government declaration of 10 November 1998, Schr\u00f6der furthermore talked of \nthe \u201eself-confidence of a grown-up nation\u201f which did not need to feel inferiority or \n                                                 \n1\n For a recent study of the continued presence of the Nazi past in the Berlin Republic, see Carolyn \nPearce, Contemporary Germany and the Nazi Legacy: Remembrance, Politics and the Dialectics of \nNormality (Basingstoke, 2008)  \n2\n Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, \u201cGedenken an den 8. Mai 1945: \u201eWir stehen erst jetzt am Ende einer langen \nNachkriegszeit\u201f\u201c S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 6 May 2005, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.sueddeutsche.de\/deutschland\/artikel\/688\/52636\/ accessed 20 March 2007. \n3\n Quoted in Marcel Tambarin, \u201eVom Dritten Reich zur \u201cBerliner Republik\u201d. Deutschlands Suche nach \nder Normalit\u00e4t.\u201f  In: Anne Saint Sauveur-Henn and Marc Muylaert, Alte und neue Identit\u00e4tsbilder im \nheutigen Deutschland (Leipziger Universit\u00e4tsverlag, 1999), pp. 97-106, p. 102. \n4\n These positions became very pronounced during the Historikerstreit in 1986\/7. For a good account of \nthis debate see Charles S. Maier, The Unmasterable Past: History, Holocaust, and German National \nIdentity (Cambridge, MA, 1988).  \nsuperiority towards others, a nation which \u201efaces history and its responsibilities but \nwhich \u2013 in spite of all its readiness to engage with it \u2013 looks ahead to the future\u201f.5  \nWith the help of a rhetorical question, he explained in an interview in 1999 that he \nconsidered an acknowledgement of Germany\u201fs past as empowering rather than posing \na constraint: \u201eDoes the readiness of a new generation to engage [with the German \npast], not to forget, not also create an opportunity to represent one\u201fs own interests in a \nmore uninhibited manner?\u201f 6  Thus, instead of \u201enormalisation\u201f happening at the \nexpense of Holocaust centred memory, Schr\u00f6der offered a new approach which \nacknowledged historical responsibility but still allowed Germany to move on.  \nThe red-green government also did not promote the renewed focus on German victims \nwhich gained considerable presence in public, literary and historical discourses at the \nbeginning of the new millennium. In contrast to earlier accounts of German \nvictimhood, the new discourse was made prominent by members of the left-liberal \nelite which had traditionally concentrated on suffering caused by the Germans and \nresulting questions of guilt and responsibility rather than German suffering. Hence, \nthe publication of Im Krebsgang (Crabwalk) by G\u00fcnter Grass in 2002 and of Der \nBrand (The Fire) by J\u00f6rg Friedrich in 2003 signified the beginning of a strong new \ntrend in debates about the German past which unsurprisingly led some commentators \nto express their concern that the renewed emphasis on German suffering might \nhappen at the expense of Holocaust centred memory.\n7\n  \nAlthough the idea of a Centre against Expulsions was mainly backed by the political \nright \u2013 expellees traditionally representing a key source of CDU\/CSU support \u2013 there \nwas modest support also from the left, the late Peter Glotz probably being the most \nprominent example. Both Schr\u00f6der and Fischer, however, explicitly warned against a \nrenewed focus on German victimhood. In the context of the debate about a Centre \nagainst Expulsions, Joschka Fischer in an interview spoke out against what he \nperceived to be an attempt to relativise German guilt through an intensive focus on \nGerman suffering. He expressed the view that the emphasis should be on what led to \nGerman suffering, not on what others did to the Germans but what the Germans had \ndone to themselves. Fischer also strongly dismissed the claim that German suffering \nused to be a taboo subject. Himself a descendent of a German ethnic minority whose \nfamily left Hungary in 1946, he said: \u201eA taboo? Quite to the contrary! All my \nchildhood consists of these stories of expulsion, occupation, nights of bombing raids \n                                                 \n5\n Presse- und Informationsamt der Bundesregierung, Bulletin 2005 (Berlin 2006). \n6\n Interview with Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, \u201eEine offene Republik\u201f, Die Zeit, 4 February 1999, p.35 \n7\n There are numerous literary examples of this renewed focus on German suffering, some of which \nactually preceded the publication of Crabwalk and can be seen as predecessors of the \u201eGermans as \nvictims\u201f discourse, e.g. W.G. Sebald, Luftkrieg und Literatur (Frankfurt\/Main, 2001) and Dieter Forte, \nSchweigen oder Sprechen (Frankfurt\/Main, 2002). For an academic discussion of some of these literary \ncontributions, see the Special Issue of German Life and Letters 57, no. 4 (2004): 343-503. Popular \nhistorical accounts include, for example, Klaus Rainer R\u00f6hl, Verbotene Trauer: Ende der deutschen \nTabus (T\u00fcbingen, 2002); Volker Hage, Hamburg 1943 (Frankfurt\/Main, 2003); Franz Kurowski, \nDresden Februar 1945 (Wien, 2003). The new discourse was also represented in the wider public \ndebate. Der Spiegel paid considerable attention to the bombing war and expulsions in special issues, a \nseries as well as book publications.   \nThe following publications have contributed to the academic debate over the discourse on German \nsuffering: Norbert Frei, \u201e1945 und wir. Wie aus T\u00e4tern Opfer werden.\u201f Bl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr deutsche und \ninternationale Politik 50, no. 3 (2005): 356-364; Eric Langenbacher, \u201eMoralpolitik versus Moralpolitik: \nRecent Struggles over the Construction of Cultural Memory in Germany.\u201f German Politics and Society \n76, no. 3 (2005): 106-133; Bill Niven (ed.), Germans as Victims (Basingstoke, 2006).  \nand the meetings of the expellees.\u201f8 Schr\u00f6der similarly asserted the need to decisively \noppose any attempts which tried to turn the perpetrators discourse into a victims \ndiscourse thus attempting to relativise Nazi crimes.\n9\n  \nEven though the sincerity of the red-green coalition\u201fs relationship with Holocaust \ncentred memory has been questioned on a number of occasions with some identifying \na \u201eculture of contrition\u201f 10  or a \u201eculture of confession\u201f (Kultur des \nSchuldeingest\u00e4ndnisses)\n11\n while others criticised it in particular for its \u201ecasual tone \ntowards the Nazi past\u201f,12 there is no doubt that the Schr\u00f6der government offered a \nnew way of accepting responsibility for the past and integrating it into the 21\nst\n century \npresent by explicitly making it a key element of German national identity.\n13\n \nAngela Merkel thus came to power at a crucial time regarding Germany\u201fs relationship \nwith its past. Not only was the discourse on Germany\u201fs Nazi past more diverse than at \nany other point in Germany\u201fs post-war history, there was also an increasing need for a \nnew approach to commemoration which did not rely on eye witnesses. \nHence, Merkel\u201fs advent to power gave rise to a number of important questions \nregarding Germany\u201fs politics of the past. Where would she position herself in view of \nthese recent developments but also in view of her GDR biography? Would she \ncontinue and maybe even reinforce the institutionalisation of Holocaust centred \nmemory and \u2013 in view of the force of the return of the topic of German victimhood \u2013 \ncomplement it with the institutionalisation of the memory of German suffering, or \nwould she emphasise the latter at the expense of the former? Or would she try to go \nback to the status quo ante and align herself with Kohl\u201fs revisionism by returning to \ndrawing the famous line under the German past? These are the questions this paper \nwill seek to answer by looking at Angela Merkel\u201fs first three years in office. \n \n \nAngela Merkel and the German Past  \n \nWhereas there were still a lot of discussions regarding the place of the Nazi past in \npost-unification German memory and identity during the Schr\u00f6der governments, \nfundamental questions regarding Germany\u201fs past and its consequences for German \nidentity have hardly featured since Angela Merkel took office in 2005. This is not to \nsay that the past was not present, however. Germany\u201fs Nazi past was the key theme of \na number of stories and scandals which have occupied newspaper headlines on several \noccasions since 2005. In August 2006, for example, the last \u201emoralische Instanz\u201f \n(moral authority) seemed to fall when G\u00fcnter Grass, icon of the left, admitted to \nhaving been a member of the Waffen-SS. In the same month, Hermann Sch\u00e4fer \u2013 \n                                                 \n8\n Interview with Foreign Secretary Joschka Fischer, Die Zeit, 28 August 2003, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.zeit.de\/2003\/36\/Fischer accessed 20 March 2007. \n9\n Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, \u201eGedenken an den 8.

Kansteiner describes the approach of the red-green government as \u201erelaxed and relatively \nself-confident\u201f. \nworking for Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and Media \n(Kulturstaatsminister) Bernd Neumann \u2013 was invited to give a speech at the opening \nconcert \u201eGedenken Buchenwald\u201f(!) of the \u201eArts Festival Weimar\u201f. Sch\u00e4fer \u2013 a \nhistorian with a research interest in the expulsions of Germans, and unaware that \nBuchenwald survivors were sitting in the audience \u2013 gave a wholly inappropriate \nspeech which nearly exclusively dealt with German victimhood in the context of the \nexpulsions while hardly mentioning the victims of the Holocaust. In April 2007, \nG\u00fcnther Oettinger in a eulogy for Hans Filbinger, one of his predecessors as Minister \nPresident of Baden-Wuerttemberg who had to resign in 1978 after having been \nexposed as a judge in the German navy who sentenced deserters to death even though \nthe war had officially already ended, described Filbinger as \u201ean opponent of the \nNational Socialist regime\u201f and \u201enot a Nazi\u201f. It was only after an intervention by \nChancellor Angela Merkel that Oettinger withdrew the comment and apologised. In \nautumn 2007, newsreader and TV show presenter Eva Herman lost her job with the \nNorddeutscher Rundfunk for controversial statements regarding family values and the \n\u201eThird Reich\u201f. Another debate which accused the protagonists of an inappropriate and \ninsensitive trivialisation of Holocaust memory was sparked off when \u2013 in the wake of \nthe Eva-Hermann scandal \u2013 the comedy duo Schmidt & Plocher used what they called \na \u201eNazometer\u201f to gauge right-wing tendencies in their audience.    \nAlthough all these events ensured a continued presence of the German past in the \npublic realm, they lacked the fundamental character that debates about the role of the \nNazi past for German national identity occupied in the 1980s during the \nHistorikerstreit and the debates about \u201enormalisation\u201f which accompanied the early \nyears of the Schr\u00f6der government. \nThe uninhibited way in which Angela Merkel even in the early stages of her \nchancellorship lectured Presidents Bush and Putin on human rights issues \u2013 the former \nover the US detention centre at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and the latter over his government\u201fs \ntreatment of human rights organisations in Russia \u2013 casts doubt over her ability to \nshow sensitivity regarding Germany\u201fs historical legacy. Right at the beginning of its \nterm in office, the Grand Coalition set out to complement the institutionalisation of \nHolocaust centred memory which had taken place under the red-green government \u2013 \nits most visible sign being the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin which opened in May \n2005 \u2013 with the institutionalisation of the memory of German victimhood. In their \ncoalition agreement, the two main parties committed themselves to \u201edealing with \nforced migration, flight and expulsion, both socially as well as historically\u201f by \ndedicating to it a \u201evisible sign\u201f in Berlin. In view of the strong reactions that the idea \nfor a Centre against Expulsions had already provoked in some of the countries where \nthe expulsions had taken place at the end of the war, most notably Poland and the \nCzech Republic, it was emphasised that this was to happen in a \u201espirit of \nreconciliation\u201f.  \nThese early signs seemed to suggest that the Merkel government\u201fs politics of the past \nwould be characterised by an emphasis on the memory of German suffering \u2013 \npossibly at the expense of Holocaust centred memory \u2013 and a very confident stance \ninternationally which showed that the \u201eburden\u201f of German history was not sufficient \nanymore to ensure some modesty vis-\u00e0-vis key victorious powers of World War II \nwith regard to values which, after all, had to be (re)introduced to (West) Germany by \nthe western powers in the aftermath of military and moral defeat only in 1945.  \nAs became obvious particularly in Polish-German relations but also in the way \nAngela Merkel strengthened Germany\u201fs relations with Israel \u2013 largely neglected by \nher predecessor who had visited Israel only once during his chancellorship and by and \nlarge left the Middle East to his Foreign Secretary Joschka Fischer \u2013 the first female \nchancellor who was socialised in the GDR has shown much more sensitivity towards \nissues of Germany\u201fs historical consciousness than could first be anticipated. Her \napproach has been characterised by three key features:  \n \n1. an unambiguous acknowledgement of German historical responsibility arising \nfrom its Nazi past without any attempts to \u201enormalise\u201f the German past; \n2. a clear appreciation of German suffering coupled with an unambiguous \nacknowledgement that this happened as a consequence of Nazi Germany\u201fs \naggressive expansionism; \n3. the creation of a link between past, present and future: the impact of \nGermany\u201fs historical responsibility on discourse and policy. \n \n \n \nAn unambiguous acknowledgement of German historical responsibility arising from \nits Nazi past without any attempts to \u201enormalise\u201f the German past \n \nGenerally speaking, Angela Merkel has continued the consolidation of Holocaust \ncentred memory as an integral part of German identity without any ifs and buts. This \nunambiguous acknowledgement of German historical responsibility does not prevent \nher \u2013 just as it did not inhibit Schr\u00f6der but rather seemed to empower him \u2013 from \nrepresenting Germany assertively in the international arena.  She has made her \nacceptance of Germany\u201fs historical responsibility explicit on numerous occasions at \nhome and abroad. For her, too, Germany\u201fs National Socialist past is a key constituent \npart of German national identity and \u201eonly by fully accepting our past at all times can \nwe shape our future together\u201f, she stated in a speech at Warsaw University in 2007.14  \nMerkel\u201fs politics of the past and her sensitivity towards responsibilities arising from \nGerman history have become most obvious in the way she has fostered relations with \nIsrael right from the beginning of her chancellorship. \nThe general approach of the Merkel government towards Israeli-German relations is \ncharacterised by a fundamental acknowledgement that these relations are \u201especial\u201f and \n\u201eunique\u201f. There is no indication to suggest that any kind of \u201enormalisation\u201f of these \nrelations would be desirable. In an interview, Foreign Secretary Frank-Walter \nSteinmeier described the memory of the Holocaust and the special relations with \nIsrael which have arisen from that as being a key constituent part of the Federal \nRepublic\u201fs foreign policy. He makes the basis for this special relationship very clear: \n\u201eWith no other country are we linked so inseparably through our history.\u201f15 \nIn March 2008, Angela Merkel visited Jerusalem \u2013 her third visit to Israel since \nbecoming Chancellor \u2013 to mark its 60th anniversary later in the year. Since the official \nanniversary celebrations only took place in May, she was the first among the heads of \nstate and government to congratulate. Together with President Shimon Peres, she \nvisited the grave of David Ben-Gurion and laid a wreath at Yad Vashem where \n                                                 \n14\nAngela Merkel, Speech at the University of Warsaw, 16  March 2007, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.bundeskanzlerin.de\/nn_5294\/Content\/DE\/Pressemitteilungen\/BPA\/2007\/03\/2007-03-16-\nrede-merkel-warschau.html accessed 2 May 2007 \n15\n Interview with Foreign Secretary Frank-Walter Steinmeier, 14 May 2008, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.auswaertiges-amt.de\/diplo\/de\/Infoservice\/Presse\/Interviews\/2008\/080514-BM-\nTribuene.html accessed 2 June 2008 \nmembers of the German and Israeli governments for the first time jointly \ncommemorated the victims of the Shoah in the Hall of Remembrance. \nIn a video message issued before her departure to Israel, Angela Merkel described the \nstable and friendly relations between Israel and Germany in view of Germany\u201fs \nNational Socialist history and the Holocaust as \u201emiracles of history\u201f and asserted: \u201eWe \nGermans want to do justice to this responsibility.\u201f16 \nAfter two German heads of state \u2013 in 2000, President Johannes Rau, and in 2005, \nPresident Horst K\u00f6hler spoke in front of the Israeli parliament \u2013 Angela Merkel was \nnot only the first German Chancellor to be invited to deliver a speech to the Knesset, \nwhich had to change its statutes in order to be able to accommodate this, but also the \nfirst head of government. \nIn her speech Merkel emphasised the importance of the Shoah for Israeli-German \nrelations by asserting that Germany and Israel were and always would remain linked \nin a special way by the memory of the Shoah. She also explicitly endorsed the view of \nthe singularity of the Holocaust. At the same time as emphasising the history of the \nShoah that linked Germany and Israel, she also pointed to the common values of the \ntwo countries, however: \u201eGermany and Israel, both share, the values of freedom, \ndemocracy and respect for human dignity.\u201f17 \nThere was some controversy over the fact that Angela Merkel would deliver her \nspeech in German, \u201ethe language of the perpetrators\u201f, and some members of the \nKnesset threatened not to attend. In the end, Merkel delivered the introduction in \nHebrew, and although some members of the Knesset were absent, on the whole her \nspeech was received very well and even honoured with a standing ovation. \nAvi Primor, former Israeli ambassador to Germany, suggested that Angela Merkel\u201fs \nconsiderable sensitivity towards Israel was not only due to her awareness of \nGermany\u201fs National Socialist history but also due to the shortcomings of the GDR in \nthis respect. He pointed out that her upbringing in the GDR made her very aware of \nthe hostile stance the GDR took against Israel, according to Levi \u201ethe worst state in \nthe communist bloc.\u201f18 In her speech to the Knesset, Merkel seemed to confirm this \nwhen she referred to her own biography: \u201eI myself spent the first 35 years of my life \nin the German Democratic Republic, a part of Germany where National Socialism \nwas considered a West German problem. But the GDR did not recognize the State of \nIsrael until shortly before its own demise. It took more than 40 years before Germany \nas a whole acknowledged and embraced both its historical responsibility and the State \nof Israel\u201f.19  \nMerkel\u201fs clear stance war received very well in Israel. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert \ndescribed the negotiations as \u201eexceptional and perhaps historical\u201f and called Angela \nMerkel and her government \u201ehonest and true friends of Israel\u201f.

A survey commissioned by the \nKonrad Adenauer foundation in 2007 found that 60% of respondents in Israel \nconsidered Merkel\u201fs election as German Chancellor to have improved the perception \nof Germany in Israel.\n21\n \n \n \nA clear appreciation of German suffering coupled with an unambiguous \nacknowledgement that this happened as a consequence of Nazi Germany\u201fs aggressive \nexpansionism \n \nAngela Merkel\u201fs appreciation of German suffering has been most pronounced with \nregard to victims of the expulsions from eastern and central Europe towards the end of \nthe war and during its immediate aftermath. This has not helped Polish-German \nrelations which were already rather tense when Angela Merkel took over from \nGerhard Schr\u00f6der. Apart from differences that arose from the present, for example, \nregarding the pipeline deal between Germany and Russia which Schr\u00f6der and Putin \nhad agreed, it has been the common past and how to commemorate it appropriately \nthat has turned out to be highly problematic. Plans for a Centre against Expulsions \u2013 \nan idea conceived by the expellee organisations already in the late 1990s \u2013 and \nattempts by the Prussian Trust (Preu\u00dfische Treuhand) to challenge ownership rights \nin Poland and the Czech Republic and pursue restitution claims even though these are \nneither supported by the German government nor even by the League of Expellees \n(Bund der Vertriebenen), have not provided the basis for smooth bilateral relations.\n22\n  \nEven though Angela Merkel has tried to redress the balance of Schr\u00f6der\u201fs legacy and \nprioritise relations with Poland since coming to office, the Nazi past and the \ncommemoration of German suffering have continued to cast a shadow over Polish-\nGerman relations under her Chancellorship.  \nMerkel reinforced Holocaust centered memory by acknowledging German guilt \ncombined with open contrition but combined it with efforts to also acknowledge and \ninstitutionalize the memory of German suffering by planning to dedicate a \u201evisible \nsign\u201f to it in Berlin. Unsurprisingly, this move has provoked concerns in Poland that \nGermany was trying to relativise history by emphasising the memory of German \nsuffering at the expense of Holocaust centred memory. In an interview with a German \nnewspaper, Donald Tusk, the new Polish Prime Minister who took office in 2007, \narticulated Polish concerns by pointing out that nobody wanted to prevent the \n                                                 \n20\n Press Statements of Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Olmert, 17 March 2008, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.bundesregierung.de\/nn_1516\/Content\/DE\/Mitschrift\/Pressekonferenzen\/2008\/03\/2008-03-\n17-pk-merkel-und-olmert.html accessed 8 May 2008 \n21\n \u201eMerkel in Israel: Neue Herzlichkeit\u201f, FAZ.NET, 17 March 2008, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.faz.net\/s\/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0\/Doc~E1A72416FC1214B1B\n9D139B26E8E50071~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html )  accessed 8 May 2008 \n22\n Poles from formerly eastern Poland who lost their property to Russia or the Ukraine filed a claim \nwith the European Court of Human Rights and won restitution from the Polish government.

He also \nargued that the way Germans were nowadays dealing with history has made \u201ethe past \nbecome a burden once again\u201f.23 \nNevertheless, Angela Merkel has repeatedly emphasised the importance of \ncommemorating German suffering and the government\u201fs commitment to establishing \na \u201evisible sign\u201f in Berlin, albeit it always with a clear eye to cause and effect. In a \nspeech at an event commemorating sixty years of expulsions organised by the \nCDU\/CSU parliamentary party entitled \u201eExpulsions \u2013 Sixty Years on, Sixty Years of \nPaths to Reconciliation\u201f, for example, she described the commemoration of the \nvictims of the expulsions as an important part of German identity. At the same time \nshe made it clear, however, that without the suffering caused by National Socialism \nand the Second World War \u2013 suffering caused by the Germans \u2013 the expulsions of \nGermans would never have happened.\n24\n \nAcknowledging the immense pain and suffering that Germany caused Poland during \nthe National Socialist period and the Second World War, in a speech at Warsaw \nUniversity in 2007, Angela Merkel reiterated her position to support a Centre against \nExpulsions so that those Germans who suffered in the context of the expulsions could \ncommemorate the experience \u201ein a dignified way\u201f. Specifying the term \u201ein a dignified \nway\u201f she made clear, however, that in her view, this did not mean a re-interpretation \nof history: \u201eFor me, such a commemoration is dignified when not only German \nexpellees and refugees but also others, naturally also Polish expellees, can \ncommemorate their suffering and when one thing in particular is clear: there is to be \nno re-interpretation of history by Germany.\u201f25 \nIn her speech on the 50\nth\n anniversary of the League of Expellees (Bund der \nVertriebenen), she took this further and described the commemoration of the suffering \nof expellees and refugees as an important part of German memory culture and identity. \nThe commemoration of German suffering was to take place in the knowledge and \nacceptance of Germany\u201fs continued responsibility for the breach of civilization of the \nHolocaust and the Second World War, however. Referring to the shortcomings of the \nstate in which she grew up, Angela Merkel also specifically addressed the fact that it \nwas particularly difficult for expellees in the GDR since they were unable to form \nrelevant associations and because flight and expulsions were simply ignored in the \npublic consciousness of the GDR.\n26\n   \nIn December 2007, Donald Tusk suggested an alternative to the Centre against \nExpulsions and proposed that the expulsions could be commemorated within the \n                                                 \n23\n Interview with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, \u201eDie Geschichte ist wieder Ballast\u201f, FAZ.NET, \n10 December 2007, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.faz.net\/s\/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0\/Doc~EBED0CCA095EF4EF\n080B4E4479D3A0117~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html accessed 11 March 2008 \n24\n Speech by Chancellor Angela Merkel at an event commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of \nexpulsions organised by the CDU\/CSU parliamentary party, 18 September 2006, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.bundeskanzlerin.de\/nn_5296\/Content\/DE\/Rede\/2006\/09\/2006-09-19-rede-bkin-60-jahre-\nvertreibung.html accessed 1 March 2007 \n25\n Angela Merkel, Speech at the University of Warsaw, 16  March 2007, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.bundeskanzlerin.de\/nn_5294\/Content\/DE\/Pressemitteilungen\/BPA\/2007\/03\/2007-03-16-\nrede-merkel-warschau.html accessed 2 May 2007 \n26\n Speech by Chancellor Angela Merkel on the 50\nth\n anniversary of the League of Expellees, 22 October \n2007, available at http:\/\/www.bundeskanzlerin.de\/nn_5296\/Content\/DE\/Rede\/2007\/10\/2007-10-22-50-\njahre-bund-der-vertriebenen.html accessed 13 February 2008 \nbroader context of a World War II museum in Gdansk which was to be established \nthrough international cooperation. Angela Merkel made it quite clear that she did not \nconsider this as a viable alternative to the Centre against Expulsions and dismissed the \nidea of the new Polish Prime Minister to integrate German suffering within a larger \nproject that would allow commemorative practice on an international scale. \n \n \nThe creation of a link between past, present and future: the impact of Germany\u201fs \nhistorical responsibility on discourse and policy \n \nWhereas Angela Merkel did not hesitate to alienate the Polish government over the \nplanned Centre against Expulsions, she used the argument of Germany\u201fs historical \nresponsibility towards Israel to justify new initiatives as well as possible future policy. \nHer approach to Israel differs not so much in terms of its basic premise \u2013 there is a \ncross-party consensus in Germany which ritually confirms Israel\u201fs \u201eright to exist\u201f and \nits security as part of Germany\u201fs raison d\u201f\u00eatre \u2013 but in the intensity with which she \nhas fostered Israeli-German relations. Bilateral relations between Germany and Israel \nhave never been as good as under Chancellor Merkel\u201fs leadership, or, as the \nEconomist put it: \u201eIt is almost official: Germany is Israel\u201fs second-best friend.\u201f27 Her \napproach also differs in terms of the implications of these relations for German \nforeign policy, in particular towards Iran. Merkel\u201fs approach towards Israel has made \nit very clear that Germany\u201fs responsibility for the past extends not only to the present \nbut also to the future. In a video podcast on the eve of her visit to Israel in 2008, she \nsaid that Germany needed to consider the responsibility for the past in its relations to \nIsrael but at the same time it had to direct the bilateral relationship towards the \nfuture.\n28\n  \nIn her speech to the Knesset on 18 March, Merkel suggested that the view often \nvoiced in speeches and at ceremonial events that Germany and Israel are linked by a \nspecial and unique relationship meant in concrete terms that any attempts to play \ndown or trivialize Nazi atrocities must be nipped in the bud. In this speech she also \ncommented on surveys that showed that a clear majority of Europeans considered \nIsrael a bigger threat to the world than Iran. In her view, politicians in Europe could \nnot afford to \u201efearfully bow to public opinion and flinch from imposing further stricter \nsanctions on Iran to persuade it to halt its nuclear programme\u201f.  Linking memory and \npolicy, Merkel called for ways of remembering not just through places of \nremembrance but by constantly recalling these memories, thus ensuring the presence \nof memory when determining (policy) behaviour: \u201eThoughts must become words, and \nwords deeds.\u201f29 \nAccordingly, Merkel has attempted to build bridges from the past to the future by \nintroducing new joint initiatives. During her visit to mark Israel\u201fs 60th anniversary, \nbilateral annual government consultations were agreed, for example, which were to \nput the bilateral relationship on a broader basis and to also impact on the two societies. \n                                                 \n27\n \u201eGermany and Israel: Friends in High Places.\u201f The Economist, 19 March 2008, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.economist.com\/world\/europe\/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10881121 accessed 8 May 2008 \n28\n Chancellor Angela Merkel, Video podcast regarding visit to Israel, 15 March 2008, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.bundeskanzlerin.de\/nn_46996\/Content\/DE\/Podcast\/2008\/2008-03-15-Video-Podcast\/2008-\n03-15-video-podcast-israel.html accessed 8 May 2008 \n29\n Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to the Knesset in Jerusalem, 18 March 2008, available \nat http:\/\/www.bundeskanzlerin.de\/Content\/DE\/Artikel\/2008\/03\/Anlagen\/2008-03-18-rede-knesset-\nenglisch,property=publicationFile.pdf accessed 8 May 2008 \nSuch consultations had until then been restricted to a very small group of countries \nincluding France, Italy, Spain, Poland and Russia. The introduction of the government \nconsultations \u2013 largely hailed as opening a \u201enew chapter\u201f in Israeli-German relations \nand for Germany the first ones outside of Europe \u2013 was to consolidate the \u201especial \nrelationship\u201f by strengthening Israeli-German political, cultural, economic and \nsocietal relations and add a new quality to the bilateral relationship which looks to the \nfuture. \nMerkel went beyond a closer bilateral relationship based on more cooperation in a \nnumber of policy areas, however. She also went beyond an acknowledgment of \nIsrael\u201fs \u201eright to exist\u201f. For her concrete responsibility arises with regard to Israel\u201fs \nsecurity: during a joint press conference with Israel\u201fs Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, \nshe made it very explicit that she considered a threat to Israel to be a \u201ethreat to us\u201f.30 \nAnd although she put a lot of emphasis on a diplomatic solution with Iran, her strong \nand unambiguous comments in this context are likely to restrict her policy options in \nthe case of future military action by the US and\/or Israel against Iran. \nOn a number of occasions, she clearly went beyond the traditional payment of lip-\nservice. Merkel repeatedly made clear in this context that words have to be followed \nby deeds. Already in her speech to the 42\nnd\n Munich Conference on Security Policy in \nFebruary 2006, she made the historical responsibility of Germany towards Israel in \nview of Iran\u201fs provocations very explicit: \n \n\u201e\u2026 we are, of course, compelled to respond to the totally unacceptable \nprovocations of the Iranian President. I am particularly called to say this in my \nrole as Chancellor of Germany. A president who questions Israel's right to exist, \na president who denies the Holocaust cannot expect Germany to show any \ntolerance at all on this issue. We have learned the lessons of our past.\u201f31 \n \nIn her speech to the UN General Assembly in September 2007, Angela Merkel also \nexplicitly made clear that for her as German Chancellor Israel\u201fs security was non-\nnegotiable and that this constituted one of the fundamental principles of Germany\u201fs \nforeign policy. Again, she pointed out that for her this had implications that went \nbeyond words: \u201eAnd that being the case, we have to do more than pay lip-service to \nit.\u201f32 In a similar vein, after having received the Leo Baeck prize from the Central \nCouncil of Jews in Germany in November 2007, Merkel said in her acceptance speech \nthat speeches at special events such as this do not suffice. It will be afterwards, in \ndaily life, that it can be seen if they have an effect, if \u201espeeches are followed by deeds\u201f \nthat is.\n33\n  \nMerkel\u201fs Foreign Secretary Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who used to be Gerhard \nSchr\u00f6der\u201fs Chief of Staff, reiterated Merkel\u201fs basic position but seemed more careful \n                                                 \n30\n Press Statements of Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Olmert, 17 March 2008, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.bundesregierung.de\/nn_1516\/Content\/DE\/Mitschrift\/Pressekonferenzen\/2008\/03\/2008-03-\n17-pk-merkel-und-olmert.html accessed 8 May 2008 \n31\nSpeech by Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Munich Conference on Security Policy, 4 February 2006, \navailable at \n http:\/\/www.securityconference.de\/konferenzen\/rede.php?menu_konferenzen=&sprache=en&id=170 \naccessed 1 March 2007 \n32\n Speech by Angela Merkel to the United Nations General Assembly, 25 September 2007, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.bundesregierung.de\/nn_6566\/Content\/EN\/Reden\/2007\/09\/2007-09-25-bk-un-\nvollversammlung__en.html accessed 8 May 2008 \n33\n Speech by Angela Merkel on receiving the Leo Baeck prize, 6 November 2007, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.zentralratdjuden.de\/de\/article\/1467.html accessed 8 May 2008 \nregarding concrete implications for policy. In his speech to the German Bundestag on \n29 May 2008 on the occasion of Israel\u201fs 60th anniversary, Steinmeier linked past and \npresent by asserting that Germany\u201fs commitment to Israel\u201fs secure future had arisen \nfrom its responsibility for the past. He said this in the context of pointing out \nGermany\u201fs special responsibility for peace in the Middle East, however.34 \nIn addition to Angela Merkel\u201fs very clear positioning regarding Israel\u201fs security and \nits foreign policy implications for Germany, right from the beginning of her \nchancellorship, she has placed great emphasis on values such as freedom and \ndemocracy. This became not only apparent in the way she has lectured the United \nStates as well as Russia on human rights issues, but also in the way she has used \nGermany\u201fs Nazi past as well as the history of the GDR and the former Soviet bloc to \npromote values such as the rule of law, freedom and justice. Referring to the key role \nthat the Solidarity movement played in bringing down communism, she said in her \nspeech at the University of Warsaw that freedom and democracy should never be \ntaken for granted but need to be protected and defended, again adding a reference to \nher own biography: \u201eThose of us who lived without freedom [in Unfreiheit] know \nthat.\u201f35 The German Chancellor also used her speech on the 50th anniversary of the \nLeague of Expellees to make this point:  \n \nThe former Heimat will of course always remain part of one\u201fs identity. [\u2026] As \nexpellees you know this better than many others. You feel when people in other \nplaces have to flee or are being expelled. You know how important it is to fight \ntirelessly for human rights and against unjust regimes, war, violence and \nexpulsions. It is for this commitment, I would like to thank you in particular.\u201f36 \n \nMuch more explicitly than her predecessors, Angela Merkel has linked past, present \nand future and expressed \u2013 especially with regard to Israel \u2013 in concrete terms what \nthe lessons learnt from the past should be, i.e. a strong commitment to Israel\u201fs \nsecurity and the promotion of human rights.    \n \n \nConclusion \n \nAngela Merkel\u201fs politics of the past is characterised by some continuity with that of \nthe Schr\u00f6der government. Especially in the context of Israeli-German relations, it \nbecame evident that she unambiguously acknowledges Germany\u201fs historical \nresponsibility arising from its Nazi past without attempting to \u201enormalise\u201f or relativise \nit. Adopting the approach of the Schr\u00f6der government, she does not consider this to \nbe an obstacle to positive expressions of German national identity and a very \nconfident stance in foreign affairs. \n                                                 \n34\n Speech by Foreign Secretary Frank-Walter Steinmeier to the Bundestag, 29 May 2008, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.auswaertiges-amt.de\/diplo\/de\/Infoservice\/Presse\/Reden\/2008\/080529-sechzig-jahre-israel-\nsteinmeier-bt.html accessed 20 June 2008  \n35\n Angela Merkel, Speech at the University of Warsaw, 16  March 2007, available at \nhttp:\/\/www.bundeskanzlerin.de\/nn_5294\/Content\/DE\/Pressemitteilungen\/BPA\/2007\/03\/2007-03-16-\nrede-merkel-warschau.html accessed 2 May 2007 \n36\n Speech by Chancellor Angela Merkel on the 50th anniversary of the League of Expellees, 22 October \n2007, available at http:\/\/www.bundeskanzlerin.de\/nn_5296\/Content\/DE\/Rede\/2007\/10\/2007-10-22-50-\njahre-bund-der-vertriebenen.html accessed 13 February 2008 \nRegarding the other key strand of German collective memory \u2013 the memory of \nGerman suffering \u2013 which has been particularly prominent since the turn of the \nmillennium \u2013 Angela Merkel has clearly positioned herself in line with Helmut Kohl, \nhowever. Her support for the Centre against Expulsions, as laid down in the coalition \nagreement of her Grand Coalition, shows Merkel\u201fs appreciation of the memory of \nGerman suffering, even though she has frequently emphasised the importance of \nacknowledging cause and effect in this context. The plan to establish a \u201evisible sign\u201f \nin Berlin which commemorates the suffering experienced by Germans in the \nexpulsions suggests that she translates the acknowledgement of German suffering into \nthe need for an institutionalisation of this memory, even if this happens at the expense \nof Germany\u201fs relationship with Poland.   \nAt first sight, this makes Angela Merkel\u201fs politics of the past appear inconsistent. She \nseems to be supporting two apparently conflicting memory strands which have \ntraditionally \u2013 albeit not without exceptions \u2013 been supported along party political \nlines with the political left usually prioritising Holocaust centred memory whereas the \nright would normally be more predisposed towards an emphasis on German suffering. \nMerkel\u201fs GDR biography might be considered to provide a convenient explanation \nfor this contradiction. After all, her emphasis on Holocaust centred memory has \nbecome particularly evident in the way she has fostered relations with Israel right \nfrom the beginning of her chancellorship. And as both she herself and also a former \nIsraeli ambassador to Germany have remarked, the state in which Merkel grew up, the \nGDR, had highly problematic relations with Israel.  \nThe suggestion that Angela Merkel\u201fs politics of the past is shaped by her GDR \nbiography could be construed to be even more persuasive when considering her \nsupport for the Centre against Expulsions. Here, too, she backs those whose suffering \n\u2013 due to the bipolar power structure of the Cold War which officially declared the \nSoviets to be friends of the GDR rather than foes \u2013 went unacknowledged in the GDR: \nthe victims of the expulsions from central and eastern Europe towards the end of the \nwar and during its aftermath.  \nHence, it could be argued that Merkel\u201fs GDR background accounts for this approach \nand that \u2013 in her capacity as chancellor of the Federal Republic \u2013 she has been trying \nto make up for the short-comings of a regime that neither recognised the state of Israel \nfor most of its lifetime nor accepted the victim status of expellees from eastern and \ncentral Europe. Reducing Angela Merkel and her politics of the past in such a way to \nthe role of \u201ethe conscience of the GDR\u201f ignores a number of other considerations, \nhowever.  \nThe way Merkel has chosen to emphasise Holocaust centred memory in the case of \nIsrael but not in the case of Poland suggests that \u201ethe lessons learnt\u201f from Germany\u201fs \nHolocaust past are much more diverse and unpredictable than they used to be. Similar \nto the red-green government under Schr\u00f6der which managed to use collective \nmemory of the Holocaust in order to justify German military involvement in the \nKosovo war, which, it was argued, was necessary to avoid another \u201eholocaust\u201f \u2013 in a \nkind of \u201epick\u201en\u201fmix\u201f fashion, Merkel also calls on elements of different memory \nstrands to lend argumentative force to her chosen course of action and legitimise it.\n37\n  \nOn numerous occasions, she has expressed the view that the past should prescribe \n(policy) behaviour for the present and future. It is not the past, however, that provides \n                                                 \n37\n For a more detailed discussion of the way the red-green coalition used German collective memory to \njustify military participation in Kosovo and Afghanistan but not in Iraq, see Ruth Wittlinger and Martin \nLarose, No Future for Germany\u201fs Past? Collective Memory and German Foreign Policy. German \nPolitics 16, no. 4 (2007): 481-495 \na set of definitive \u201elessons\u201f, as Merkel tries to make out, but rather the present along \nwith present needs  \u2013 as Halbwachs argued persuasively \u2013 that determines which \nelements of collective memory are called upon. \nMerkel is thus pursuing the plan of a Centre against Expulsions even though this \nalienates particularly Poland, at the same time as emphasising Germany\u201fs \u201especial\u201f \nrelationship with Israel based on the Holocaust. Even if one takes into account the \nvery different scale of atrocities committed by Nazi Germany in both cases, the \ndiffering emphasis is still striking and suggests that the real reason goes much beyond \nMerkel merely making up for where the GDR failed.  \nHer politics of the past is likely to have derived from electoral considerations and \nconcerns of realpolitik. Her support for the Centre against Expulsions is no doubt due \nto the fact that expellees traditionally represent an important electoral clientele of the \nCDU\/CSU. In view of the renewed focus on \u201eGermans as victims\u201f in a number of \ndiscourses, recently voiced strong demands for such a Centre could hardly be ignored \nby a conservative German Chancellor without the risk of paying a high price for this \nin electoral terms. With regard to the bilateral relations with Israel, Merkel has used \nher politics of the past to clearly position Germany as a key ally which will support \u2013 \npossibly even militarily \u2013 Israel in a possible attack against by Iran. By default, this \nmeans that she has also clearly aligned Germany with the US. Her frequently \nexpressed view that there should be a link between past, present and future and that \nGermany\u201fs historical responsibility should have an impact on discourse and (policy) \nbehaviour, in particular towards Iran, illustrates the way she has used the Holocaust \ncentred strand of German collective memory to legitimise her position and possible \nfuture action regarding this issue. Her rhetoric has certainly pushed Germany to centre \nstage as an ally against Iran and is likely to ensure that it plays a key role on the side \nof the US in future developments in the Middle East.  \n"}
