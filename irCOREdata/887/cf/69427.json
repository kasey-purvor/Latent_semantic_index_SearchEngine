Possible theoretical explanations are discussed.\nIndex Terms\u2014Frequency twinning, magnetrons, microwave\ntubes.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAN INSTABILITY, known as twinning [1], is exhibited bysome magnetrons under certain operating conditions. This\ninstability causes the magnetron to oscillate at two (or some-\ntimes more) frequencies. Figs. 1 and 2 show examples of the\nfrequency spectrum of a low-power X-band magnetron. Both\nspectra were produced by the same tube but at different anode\nvoltages. Fig. 1 shows the desired spectrum when the tube is\nnot twinning. When the tube is twinning (Fig. 2), the spectrum\nshows two peaks separated by only a few megaHertz. Although\nthis phenomenon has been known for many years, it has re-\nceived surprisingly little attention in the literature and we have\nnot been able to find any more recent papers on it. Not all mag-\nnetrons suffer from twinning, and in many cases, it does not\noccur within the normal operating range of the tube. When it\ndoes occur, however, it can cause a significant number of tubes\nto be rejected during manufacture. It may also develop during\nthe life of a tube as a result of aging processes with the conse-\nquence that the system in which it is installed does not perform\nas expected. This paper describes the results of an experimental\ninvestigation that aimed to gain a greater understanding of twin-\nning and of the factors affecting it.\nII. MAGNETRON PERFORMANCE\nA magnetron is a diode that conducts very little current as\nthe anode voltage is increased from zero until the threshold\nvoltage is reached at which oscillations begin. The oscillations\nManuscript received October 6, 1999; revised March 8, 2000. This work was\nsupported by EEV Ltd.

Magnetron spectrum showing twinning.\nthen build rapidly until the output power saturates. Once the tube\nis oscillating the anode voltage is not found to vary very much\nover a wide range of anode currents. Fig. 3 shows the relation-\nship between the anode voltage and current for a typical tube. It\ncan be seen that the current\/voltage relationship also depends on\nthe strength of the axial magnetic field in the interaction region.\nThe lines in the current\/voltage plot commonly exhibit discon-\ntinuities that are known as \u201cGauss line discontinuities\u201d [1].\nThe frequency of oscillation of a magnetron is determined\nby the resonant frequency of the anode in its -mode modified\nby the effects of electron loading. These cause the frequency\nto change as the anode current changes, a phenomenon known\nas frequency pushing. Fig. 4 shows a typical frequency pushing\ncurve for a modern magnetron. The tube is designed to be oper-\nated in the region to the right of the peak of the curve so that the\n0093\u20133813\/00$10.00 \u00a9 2000 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Typical current\/voltage curves showing discontinuities associated with\ntwinning.\nFig. 4. Typical frequency pushing curve.\nfrequency is not strongly dependent on the current. The kink\nin the curve just to the left of the peak is seen in some tubes,\nand twinning commonly occurs close to this point. Twinning\nmay also occur at higher currents within the normal operating\nrange of the tube. It is observed that even in tubes that do not\ntwin, there is a marked change in the spectrum in the vicinity\nof the kink in the pushing curve. This is generally attributed to\nthe rapid change in the slope of the pushing curve in this region.\nThe frequency of oscillation is also affected by the amplitude\nand phase of any external mismatch. This changes the reactive\nloading on the anode resulting in frequency pulling.\nIII. OBSERVATIONS OF TWINNING\nAn extensive series of experimental observations was carried\nout on standard and modified low-power X-band pulsed mag-\nnetrons. The permanent magnets were removed from the tubes\nto allow them to be operated in an electromagnet so that the\nmagnetic field strength could be varied. It was also necessary to\nmodify the modulator so that fine adjustments could be made\nto the anode voltage because twinning commonly occurs over a\nvery narrow range of operating conditions. Observations were\nmade of the current, voltage, and radio frequency (RF) pulse\nFig. 5. Typical RF pulse when the tube is twinning.\nwaveforms and of the frequency spectrum. The onset of twin-\nning was observed in the spectrum and in the splitting of the RF\noutput pulse, as shown in Fig. 5. When a sequence of RF output\npulses was recorded, it was found that there were two pulse\nshapes that occurred randomly with, occasionally, some inter-\nmediate shape, as shown in Fig. 6. From this, it appears that the\nmagnetron may switch during a pulse between two states that\nhave different anode currents and frequencies of oscillation. It\nis important to distinguish between these states and the modes\nof oscillation associated with different resonances of the anode.\nWhen a change of the anode mode takes place, the magnetron is\nsaid to be \u201cmoding\u201d or having \u201cmissing pulses,\u201d and the effects\nare much larger than are those associated with twinning.\nAdditional studies were carried out using a much wider range\nof magnetron types to find out which design parameters might\nbe relevant to controlling the occurrence of twinning. This study\nshowed no clear correlations, except that twinning was much\nmore likely to be observed in tubes for which the ratio of the\nelectron cyclotron frequency to the frequency of oscillation lay\nin the range 0.75 to 1.25.\nA. Dependence of Twinning on the Voltage Pulse\nWhen a tube twins, it does so over one or more narrow ranges\nof the anode voltage, and some care is needed to make sure that\nan occurrence of twinning is not missed. Twinning may coin-\ncide with a Gauss Line discontinuity, but this is not necessarily\nthe case. Not all discontinuities are associated with twinning,\nand twinning may occur where there is no observable disconti-\nnuity. In the latter case, it may be that there is a discontinuity\nthat is too small to observe. The frequency difference between\nthe twin states was found to be related to the change in the anode\ncurrent, and to the slope of the frequency pushing curve at that\npoint, so that large current changes tended to be associated with\nrelatively larger frequency jumps. As the anode voltage was in-\ncreased through a region of twinning, it was observed that there\nwas a steady change in the proportions of the pulses at the two\nfrequencies.\nFor the high current twin, it was found that the split in the cur-\nrent pulse occurred somewhere close to the center of the pulse.\nWhen the pulse was then shortened, the twinning disappeared.\nThis is consistent with the view that the tube is switching from\none state to another during the pulse. For the low current twin,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on December 23, 2008 at 06:34 from IEEE Xplore.

Example of a sequence of RF output pulses when the tube is twinning.\non the other hand, the split in the current pulse appeared to\noccur at, or near, the beginning of the pulse. The change of state\nmust, therefore, be happening very rapidly early in the pulse, for\nthis type of twinning, or else the frequency must be changing\nfrom pulse to pulse. If twinning is associated with changes be-\ntween different states of the electron cloud within the tube, it\nmight be expected that it would be influenced by changes in\nthe impedance of the modulator. We observed changes in the\nfrequency jump associated with the twin as a result of changes\nin the modulator impedance, but we were not able to eliminate\ntwinning by this means.\nB. Dependence of Twinning on the Magnetic Field\nAn investigation was carried out into the effect on twinning\nof changes in the magnetic field in the interaction region. The\nrange of field strengths that could be used was limited to those\nfor which the magnetron would operate stably. Fig. 7 shows the\nfrequency pushing curves at three different magnetic fields for\na tube that twinned at both low and high currents. The lower\ncurrent at which twinning occurs did not change much with\nmagnetic field, whereas the higher current varied widely with\nchanges in the field. This suggests that there may be at least\ntwo different types of twinning with different underlying phys-\nical mechanisms. In this tube, it would be possible to keep the\nnormal operating range free from twinning by a suitable choice\nof the magnetic field. The ratios of the cyclotron frequency to\nthe frequency of oscillation for the three curves are 1.11, 1.26,\nand 1.38. Thus, the highest curve corresponds to a value of this\nparameter for which we have already observed that twinning is\nless likely to occur in the normal operating range of the tube.\nFig. 7. Frequency pushing curves showing the dependence of twinning on\nmagnetic field.\nC. Dependence of Twinning on the Cathode\nIt was known from earlier studies that twinning could be af-\nfected by changes in the composition of the cathode coating.\nExperiments were carried out in which the heater power was\nchanged. This was also found to have a marked effect on the\ntwinning, but in ways that differed appreciably between nom-\ninally identical tubes. In some cases, a change in the heater\npower caused additional twinning frequencies to appear. There\nwas also a change in the frequency jump, but the change was an\nincrease in some tubes and a decrease in others. The change in\nthe heater power generally moved the twin to a different oper-\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Rieke diagram showing the effect of external mismatch on twinning.\nThe shaded region shows where the tube was twinning for different values of the\nVSWR. The frequency difference between the pairs of twinning states is shown\nin megaHertz.\nating point, and it affected the frequency through changes in the\ntemperature of the anode.\nThe concentricity of the cathode is also known to have an\neffect on twinning. On occasion, it is possible to improve the\nperformance of a tube by moving the cathode sideways. Unfor-\ntunately, it is not easy to tell in any individual case whether the\nperformance has been improved by increasing or decreasing the\nconcentricity. Experimental tubes were manufactured in which\nthe cathode was deformed so that its cross section was no longer\ncircular, but this was found to make little difference to the twin-\nning.\nD. Dependence of Twinning on the External Match\nA variable mismatch whose amplitude and phase could be\nvaried independently was inserted in the output waveguide. The\ntube was first adjusted to be twinning without any mismatch, the\nmismatch was introduced, and the behavior of the tube noted\nas the amplitude and phase were varied. Fig. 8 shows a typ-\nical set of results in which the reference plane was chosen so\nthat the points at which twinning was observed lay on the circle\ncorresponding to a mismatch having a real part equal to unity.\nFor each VSWR, the tube twinned in the shaded region of the\ndiagram with the frequency differences between the twinning\nstates in megaHertz as marked. The twinning could, therefore,\nbe stopped by changing the mismatch, though this presumably\nmoved it to a different operating point rather than eliminating it\ncompletely. This was confirmed by setting the anode current to\nvalues above and below the twinning point when it was found\nthat the tube could be induced to twin by adjusting the external\nmatch. In each case, the twinning region divided the chart into\ntwo regions in which the shapes of the spectra were different\nand corresponded to those observed at anode currents above and\nbelow the twinning point.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nIt seems probable that twinning is caused by changes in the\nloading of the anode by electrons. The existence of twinning,\nand of Gauss Line discontinuities, at more than one operating\npoint suggests that there are a number of possible states, each\nof which:\n1) is stable over a certain range of operating conditions;\n2) has its own Gauss Line;\n3) has its own spectrum.\nBoth twinning and Gauss Line discontinuities would, there-\nfore, occur under those conditions in which there was a change\nfrom one stable state to another. Because the oscillation of a\nmagnetron starts up from random noise, it would follow that\nwhen two states were equally stable, oscillation might occur in\neither of them with random occurrence from pulse to pulse. In\nother cases, the starting conditions might be such as to select an\nunstable state with the possibility of a jump to a more stable state\nduring the pulse. It is not clear, however, whether the twinning\nobserved at different currents is associated with one, or more\nthan one, underlying physical phenomenon.\nSchumacher [1] suggested that twinning was caused by axial\nvariations in the electron cloud associated with axial variations\nin the strength of the magnetic field. His hypothesis was that\nthere could be two, or more, elementary magnetrons, each\nof which would have a slightly different frequency because\nof the different electron loading of the anode. The frequency\nwould then be determined by whichever of these elementary\nmagnetrons represented the preferred state. We used computer\nsimulation to investigate the uniformity of the magnetic field\nin the magnetrons used in our experiments. It was concluded\nthat the departures of the field from uniformity were unlikely\nto be big enough for Schumacher\u2019s hypothesis to explain the\nmechanism of twinning in these tubes.\nAnother possible hypothesis is that twinning is caused by\nmultipactor discharges within the magnetron. The observations\nmade by Vaughan on a low-voltage continuous wave magnetron\n[2] showed that multipactor discharges are not uncommon in\nsuch tubes. Discharges were observed between the vane tips\nand between the vane tips and the pole pieces. Multipactor dis-\ncharges start and stop abruptly as the operating conditions are\nchanged, and crossed-field discharges occur over wide ranges of\noperating conditions [3]. It is, therefore, possible that the high\ncurrent twin, which is strongly affected by the magnetic field,\nas shown in Fig. 7, is associated with the onset of such a dis-\ncharge. However, it is not clear how the conditions for multi-\npactor discharge on the anode would be affected by changes in\nthe cathode coating, temperature, or concentricity. Thus, multi-\npactor discharges may be responsible for the high-current twin,\nbut cannot explain the low-current twin.\nRecent work by McDowell [4] has shown striking differences\nbetween the behavior of the electrons within the magnetron in\nsimulations with different assumptions about the electron emis-\nsion from the cathode. All observations of twinning reported\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on December 23, 2008 at 06:34 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\nCARTER et al.: MAGNETRON FREQUENCY TWINNING 909\nin this paper were made on tubes whose normalized parame-\nters were similar to those of the 4J50\/4J52 simulated by Mc-\nDowell. In our experiments, the twinning occurred at cathode\ncurrent densities exceeding 20 A.cm , and the tubes were,\ntherefore, in McDowell\u2019s secondary emission dominated state.\nMcDowell showed that in this state, the electron cloud had a\nregion of low-charge density that moved through the spokes. It\nwas found that the characteristic phenomena of the secondary\nemission dominated state were not strongly affected by changes\nin the secondary electron emission coefficient of the cathode. At\nfirst sight, this would seem to rule out these fluctuations of the\ninner space charge as a cause of twinning. However, we would\nobserve that twinning is associated with only small changes in\nthe performance of a magnetron and that all our observations\nare consistent with the suggestion that it is dependent in some\nway on secondary electron emission from the cathode. Because\ntwinning occurs over only a very small range of operating con-\nditions, it is unlikely that McDowell\u2019s simulation would have\nrevealed just those conditions under which twinning occurs. It\nwould, therefore, be interesting to see whether the mechanism\nof twinning could be demonstrated using computer simulation.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe experimental study carried out has added considerably\nto our knowledge of the phenomenon of twinning. Design pa-\nrameters having a critical effect on the occurrence of twinning\ninclude the choice of magnetic field, of cathode coating, and of\ncathode temperature. By careful choice of these, it is possible,\nin many cases, to eliminate twinning or to move the points at\nwhich it occurs outside the normal operating range of the tube.\nPossible explanations of twinning have been advanced that are\nbroadly consistent with our experimental observations. Further\nresearch is needed to investigate these hypotheses in detail.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank N.
