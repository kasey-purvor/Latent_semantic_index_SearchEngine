It was shown to be metabolized by a Pseudomonas\nsp. with conversion into 17-hydroxylupanine as the first step\n(Scheme 1) [1]. The enzyme involved is induced by growth of the\norganism on lupanine. It was partially purified by Rogozinski [2]\nand later purified and characterized by Hopper et al. [3]. It is\nlocated in the periplasm of the organism [4] and is a monomeric\nprotein of M\nr\n72000 containing one molecule of pyrroloquinoline\nquinone (PQQ) and one covalently bound haem as cofactors. It\ncatalyses the dehydrogenation of lupanine with the PQQ acting\nas electron acceptor and the electrons are transferred to the haem\nbefore being passed to an external acceptor. This acceptor has\nnot yet been identified but the enzyme will rapidly reduce horse\nScheme 1 The reaction catalysed by lupanine hydroxylase\nAbbreviations used: lys-C, endoproteinase Lys-C; PQQ, pyrroloquinoline quinone.\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (e-mail dvh!aber.ac.uk).\nThe nucleotide sequence of luh has been deposited in the GenBank2\/EMBL\/DDBJ Nucleotide Sequence Databases under accession number\nAJ318095.\nfor the transport of the enzyme to its periplasmic location.\nAnalysis of the protein sequence showed that it contains two\ndomains, a large PQQ-binding N-terminal domain and a smaller\ncytochrome c C-terminal domain. Comparison of the derived\nsequence with those of other proteins showed considerable\nsimilarity with other quino(haemo)proteins, including alcohol\ndehydrogenases from a variety of bacteria. The PQQ-binding\ndomain sequence contains W motifs, characteristic of the eight-\nbladed \u2018propeller \u2019 structure of methanol dehydrogenase, but\nlacks the unusual disulphide ring structure formed from two\nadjacent cysteines seen in this enzyme.

Addition of water to the dehydrogenated lupanine\ngives the hydroxylated product (Scheme 1).\nIn terms of its size and cofactor content lupanine hydroxylase\nis similar to the quinohaemoprotein type II alcohol dehydro-\ngenases such as that from Comamonas testosteroni. This enzyme\nhas an M\nr\nof 73200, contains one PQQ and one covalently bound\nhaem and is also found in the periplasm [5]. The gene for this\nalcohol dehydrogenase has been cloned and sequenced [6] and\nrecently the crystal structure has been determined [7] at a\nresolution of 1.44 AI . Both the derived amino acid sequence and\nthe tertiary structure of the N-terminal PQQ-binding domain\nshow considerable similarity with the a subunit of the PQQ-\ncontaining methanol dehydrogenases. The methanol dehydro-\ngenases have been extensively studied and the three-dimensional\nstructures of those from Methylobacterium extorquens and\nMethylophilus methylotrophus W3A1 have been elucidated using\nX-ray crystallography [8,9]. The haem-binding C-terminal do-\nmain of the alcohol dehydrogenase from C. testosteroni shows\nsimilarity to some c-type cytochromes.\nMost PQQ-containing enzymes that have been described are\ndehydrogenases acting on alcohols or glucose, but lupanine\nhydroxylase, while catalysing a dehydrogenation, is unusual in\nacting on a tertiary amine. To study the relationship of lupanine\nhydroxylase with other quinohaemoproteins and to help us move\ntowards an understanding of the reaction mechanism, we have\nnow cloned and sequenced the gene for this enzyme. Previous\nstudies of the enzyme have been hampered by the need to extract\nand purify lupanine from plant material for growth of the\n# 2002 Biochemical Society\n484 D. J. Hopper and others\nbacterium and we also describe here the expression of the gene in\nEscherichia coli and reactivation of the product, giving a source\nof active enzyme without this requirement for lupanine.\nEXPERIMENTAL\nEnzyme purification and reactivation\nNative lupanine hydroxylase was purified from a Pseudomonas\nsp. grown on lupanine by the procedure described by Hopper et\nal. [3].\nEnzyme produced by expression of the luh gene in E. coli was\nactivated and partially purified as follows. Cells harvested from\n12 l of culture were resuspended in 10 mM Tris}HCl buffer,\npH 8, containing 1 mM EDTA, disrupted by sonication and\ncentrifuged at 27000 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was\nresuspended in 50 ml of 8 M urea and left on ice for 30 min.\nAfter recentrifuging, the supernatant was quickly mixed with\n1.5 l of buffer containing 0.13 mM PMSF and 0.2 mM 1,10-\nphenanthroline and incubated at 20 \u00b0C for 30 min. A slurry\n(30 ml) of DEAE-cellulose in buffer was added and, after gentle\nstirring for 30 min at 20 \u00b0C, this was removed by fitration and\neluted with 300 ml of buffer containing 1 M NaCl. The eluate\nwas dialysed at 4 \u00b0C against water and applied to a column\n(6 cm\u20392.5 cm) of Q Sepharose FF equilibrated with 20 mM\nTris}HCl buffer, pH 8.0. This was washed with 100 ml of buffer\nand then with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 M KCl in 500 ml of\nbuffer. Pooled enzyme-containing fractions were concentrated\nby pressure filtration through a PM10 membrane and further\npurified by FPLC on a Superdex 75 16}60 column eluted with\n20 mM Tris}HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 \u00b0C. Enzyme was detected in\ncolumn fractions by spectrophotometric assay after reactivation\nof 100 ll portions by incubation with 50 lM PQQ and 1 mM\nCaCl\n#\nfor 30 min at 20 \u00b0C.\nEnzyme assay\nLupanine hydroxylase activity was measured by the spectro-\nphotometric assay with horse heart cytochrome c as an electron\nacceptor [3].\nProtein sequencing\nTheN-terminal analysis of the enzyme and sequencing of peptides\nobtained by digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C (EC 3.4.21.50;\nlys-C) were performed by automated Edman degradation on an\nApplied Biosystems model 473A sequencer at the sequencing\nservice of the University of Aberdeen. C-terminal analysis was\nperformed at the Mayo Protein Core Facility (Mayo Clinic,\nRochester, MN, U.S.A.) using an Applied Biosystems Procise C\nchemical C-terminal sequencer.\nDNA manipulations\nChromosomal DNA was isolated from a Pseudomonas sp. by the\ncetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method of Wilson\n[10]. The procedure of He et al. [11] or the Wizard Midiprep\nDNA purification system from Promega were used to purify\nplasmid DNA. The standard procedures described by Sambrook\net al. [12] were used for DNA restriction, phosphorylation,\nagarose-gel electrophoresis, PCR and transformation of com-\npetent E. coli cells ; competent cells were prepared as described by\nHanahan [13]. PCR was performed on a Hybaid OmniGene\nthermal cycler using SuperTaq DNA polymerase (Kramel Bio-\ntechnology, Cramlington, Northumberland, U.K.). Primers were\nmade by MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). Their se-\nquences were: 5\u00ab-AAC GAR CAR CAY TAC TTY-3\u00ab (1F); 5\u00ab-\nTTC CAR TAR TCN GT-3\u00ab (1R); 5\u00ab-AAT GAA AAA GAC\nGGC TCT GCG GTG-3\u00ab (2F) and 5\u00ab-CTA YTG NGC NCC-3\u00ab\n(2R). The PCR reaction contained 10 mM Tris}HCl, pH 8.8,\n1.5 mM MgCl\n#\n, 50 mM KCl, 0.1% (v}v) Triton X-100, 0.2 mM\nof each dNTP, 10 lg of template chromosomal DNA, 25 pmol of\neach primer and 2 units of SuperTaq in a final volume of 50 ll\noverlaid with 50 ll of paraffin oil. The mixture was subjected to\n10 rounds of thermocycling involving denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for\n1 min, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 2 min and extension at 72 \u00b0C using\na Hybaid thermocycler.Amplificationwas continued for a further\n20 cycles with the annealing temperature raised to 62 \u00b0C. The\namplified products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis\nand the regions of interest carefully excised. The DNA was\nrecovered in solution by using either Pharmacia Sephaglas\nBandPrep kit or Promega Wizard DNA Clean-Up system. DNA\nsequencing was performed at the Sir John Dunn School of\nPathology, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K., using an auto-\nmated fluorescence Applied Biosystem ABI DNA 377 sequencer.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nPeptide sequences\nLupanine hydroxylase was purified from a Pseudomonas sp. and\nthe sequence of the first 31 amino acids from the N-terminus was\ndetermined as NEKDGSAVTSGNWSLLGGGNEQHYFSAL-\nKDV (sequence 1). Several internal peptides that were produced\nby digestion with lys-C were also sequenced, giving the following\nresults : AWTAYDTQQTLK (sequence 2) ; MQAITGAPRVG-\nGGK (sequence 3) ; NLWTYTPEVQ (sequence 4) and TWGT-\nDYWK (sequence 5).\nPartial gene sequence and restriction map\nPart of the N-terminal sequence and sequence 5 were used to\ndesign forward 18 nt and reverse 14 nt primers (1F and 1R).\nUsing these primers in a PCR, with chromosomal DNA from the\nPseudomonas sp. as a template, resulted in the selective amplifica-\ntion of a 600 bp fragment. This was ligated into a pGEM-A}T\ncloning vector and transformed into E. coli DH5a using standard\nprocedures [12]. The sequence of the insert in plasmid DNA\nisolated from one of the several white recombinant colonies had\nan open reading frame that corresponded to the amino acid\nsequences from which the primers were designed. It also encom-\npassed sequences 3 and 4 from the lys-C digestion products of\nlupanine hydroxylase indicating that the PCR product was part\nof the luh gene encoding this enzyme. The BamHI-excised 600 bp\nDNA insert was used to construct a restriction map of the area\naround the luh gene (Figure 1). Southern blotting indicated that\nthe complete gene was located on a 6.6 kb EcoRI fragment. To\nobtain some additional sequence information upstream from the\n5\u00ab end of the coding sequence of the mature protein this part of\nthe gene was amplified by ligation-mediated PCR. Chromosomal\nDNA was digested with HindIII and ligated with the vector\npMTL20 [14]. A PCR using this as the template with a forward\nvector-based primer and a reverse primer based on a previously\nsequenced fragment gave an expected fragment of 500 bp. This\nwas recovered and ligated with the vector pXCM with the\ntransformants screened for ampicillin resistance and kanamycin\nsensitivity. The sequence of the cloned fragment confirmed the\nN-terminal sequence of the mature protein and extended it to\ninclude the potential secretory signal sequence region.\nSequence of luh gene\nTo obtain the complete gene sequence, the C-terminus of the\npurified lupanine hydroxylase was sequenced and gave the\n# 2002 Biochemical Society\n485Lupanine hydroxylase\nFigure 1 A restriction map of the segment of chromosomal DNA including the lupanine hydroxylase gene\nThe boxed region represents the PCR product obtained using primers 1F and 2R.\ntripeptide GAQ. A reverse primer (2R) based on this tripeptide\nplus a stop codon was designed and used in a PCR in conjunction\nwith a forward primer (2F) based on the determined sequence of\nthe N-terminus of lupanine hydroxylase. This resulted in pro-\nduction of an E 1800 bp fragment that contained the complete\nsequence for the mature enzyme. The sequence of the original\n600 bp PCR product was precisely reproduced in the 1800 bp\nfragment. The gene sequence and the derived protein sequence\nfor lupanine hydroxylase are shown in Figure 2. All the peptide\nsequences obtained from the purified protein are seen in the\nderived protein sequence of the luh gene product (underlined in\nFigure 2) and the M\nr\nof the derived mature protein, 72256, is\nclose to that of 72000 found by SDS}PAGE for the purified\nprotein [3]. This supports the proposal that this gene does encode\nlupanine hydroxylase and this is further reinforced by the\npresence of a typical cytochrome c haem-binding site (CXXCH)\nand the many similarities to the sequences of other quinoproteins\n(see below).\nSignal sequence\nLupanine hydroxylase is a periplasmic protein [4] and, as the\nregion coding for the N-terminal sequence of the mature protein\nstarts at base 78 from the start codon of the open reading frame,\nit is reasonable to propose that the first 26 amino acids represent\nthe signal sequence needed for translocation of the enzyme.\nFurther evidence for this came from analysis of the N-terminus\nby the SignalP V2.0 computer program [15]. This gave a signal\npeptide probability of 1.000 and predicted the signal peptidase\ncleavage site to be between amino acids 26 and 27 with a\nprobability of 0.986. It appears to be a Sec signal sequence and,\nalthough some periplasmic redox proteins use an export pathway\nsignalled by a double-arginine signal peptide, those binding\nredox cofactors such as iron porphyrins and PQQ are generally\nassociated with standard Sec signal sequences [16].\nExpression of luh gene in E. coli\nFinal evidence that the cloned gene codes for lupanine hydroxy-\nlase required heterologous expression to give an active enzyme.\nInitial attempts to express the gene in E. coli were unsuccessful\nfor a number of possible reasons including incompatibility of the\nsignal sequence and the requirement for haem insertion. We have\naddressed these problems by replacing the signal sequence with\nthe 21 residue E. coli alkaline phosphatase signal sequence and\nby including plasmid pEC86 which expresses constitutively the\ngenes for cytochrome c maturation protein factors [17]. The\nregion of the luh gene encoding the mature protein was amplified\nby PCR using 5\u00ab-NsiI}3\u00ab-EcoRI-adapted primers. The DNA\nfragment (E 2000 bp) was cleaved with NsiI and EcoRI and\nligated into PstI- and EcoRI-cleaved plasmid pLiQ [18] to give\nthe plasmid pEV-LH32. Plasmid pEV-LH32 was introduced into\nE. coli TB1 host harbouring pEC86. The organism was grown\nfor 6 h aerobically and then for 12 h under conditions of low\naeration in medium containing limited phosphate (0.1 mM) to\ninduce expression. As controls, the organism was grown with a\nphosphate concentration of 25 mM, enough to prevent induction,\nand E. coli containing only the pEC86 plasmid was also grown\nunder both inducing and non-inducing conditions.\nCells were harvested by centrifugation and only those con-\ntaining both plasmids grown under inducing conditions gave a\npink pellet, indicative of the presence of cytochromes. SDS}\nPAGE of total protein showed that only these cells contained an\nextra haem-staining protein of the same M\nr\nas lupanine hydroxy-\nlase (Figure 3). On breakage of the cells and centrifugation the\npink protein was present as inclusion bodies in the same fraction\nas the cell membranes. Inactive enzyme was prepared by solubi-\nlizing and incubating this fraction in 8 M urea followed by rapid\ndilution of the soluble fraction. After further incubation of this\npreparation with PQQ and CaCl\n#\n, lupanine hydroxylase activity\ncould be detected in the spectrophotometric assay, showing that\nholoenzyme had been produced. Both compounds were needed\nfor enzyme activation and this is the first demonstration that, in\ncommon with other PQQ-containing enzymes, lupanine hydroxy-\nlase requires calcium ions. Further evidence that this expression\nsystem had achieved the incorporation of the haem group into\nlupanine hydroxylase came from the partial purification of\nenzyme from 12 l of culture by ion-exchange chromatography\nand gel filtration. The results of SDS}PAGE at each stage are\nincluded in Figure 3. The spectrum of the protein was that of a\nc-type cytochrome in the oxidized state (Figure 4), as expected\nfor lupanine hydroxylase [3]. Addition of PQQ and Ca#+ gave\nonly minor changes in the spectrum but when lupanine was also\nincluded the haem group was rapidly reduced (Figure 4), evidence\nthat active lupanine hydroxylase had been produced. Thus the\nisolated gene has been shown to code for lupanine hydroxylase\nand a comparison of the derived protein sequence with those of\nother proteins can now be made.\nSequence comparison with other proteins\nA BLAST search [19] for proteins with sequences similar to that\nof the derived amino acid sequence for lupanine hydroxylase\nrevealed similarities to many other quinoproteins. The greatest\nsimilarity was with the quinohaemoprotein ethanol dehydro-\ngenase of C. testosteroni, which had 36% identity and 54%\npositives (i.e. identical and conserved residues) shown over the\nfull length of the gene. Other quinohaemoproteins including the\ntype III membrane-bound alcohol dehydrogenases ofAcetobacter\nand Gluconobacter also showed similarity to the deduced luh gene\nproduct.\nLupanine hydroxylase from the Pseudomonas sp. and alcohol\ndehydrogenase from C. testosteroni are both monomers with M\nr\nvalues of about 70000, containing one molecule of PQQ and a\nsingle haem c. Both show sequence similarity to the a subunit of\n# 2002 Biochemical Society\n486 D. J.

As controls, protein fractions from non-induced (lane 1) and induced (lane 2) E. coli containing\nonly the pEC86 plasmid were also examined. Lane 5 is crude luh gene product after partial purification by ion-exchange chromatography and lane 6 is after further purification by gel filtration.\nFor comparison, lane 7 shows a sample of purified lupanine hydroxylase from the Pseudomonas sp. and lane 8 contains molecular-mass markers.\nFigure 4 Absorption spectrum of partially purified heterologously produced\nenzyme\nThe UV\/visible spectrum of the partially purified lupanine hydroxylase produced by expression\nof the luh gene in E. coli was recorded (dashed line). The enzyme was activated by addition\nof PQQ (5 lM) and CaCl2 (33 lM) to the cuvette. Further addition of lupanine (10 lM) resulted\nin reduction of the haem (solid line).\nthe PQQ-containing methanol dehydrogenases. The methanol\ndehydrogenases have an a\n#\nb\n#\ntetrameric structure and bind one\nPQQ molecule per a subunit, but do not contain haem. As might\nbe expected, their similarity with lupanine hydroxylase extends\nonly over the first 550 amino acids, the putative PQQ-binding\ndomain, and not into the haem-binding domain of the C-\nterminus.\nThe X-ray structure of the a subunit of methanol dehydro-\ngenase is unusual and consists of a superbarrel structure made\nup of eight antiparallel b sheets (W motifs) arranged like the\nbladesof apropeller.These are held together bynovel tryptophan-\ndocking motifs of 11 amino acids [20]. Similar motifs are seen in\nother quinoproteins including the dimeric, non-haem ethanol\ndehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the quino-\nhaemoprotein from C. testosteroni. The crystal structures of\nthese proteins show that their PQQ-binding domains have a\ntertiary structure similar to that of the a subunit of methanol\ndehydrogenase [7,21]. Alignment [22] of the lupanine hydroxylase\nsequence with those of ethanol dehydrogenase of C. testosteroni\nand methanol dehydrogenase of M. extorquens also shows eight\nW motifs (Figure 5), again suggesting a similar tertiary structure\nfor the PQQ-binding domain in this enzyme.\nSome of the invariant residues seen in PQQ enzymes and\nshown in methanol dehydrogenase of M. extorquens and the\nhaemoquinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase of C. testosteroni to\nbe involved in the active site and interacting with PQQ are also\npresent in lupanine hydroxylase. These include Arg-109 (109),\nThr-152 (159) and Asn-383 (394) with the number in brackets\nreferring to the residue position in the methanol dehydrogenase.\nArg-331 of methanol dehydrogenase is replaced by Lys-320 as is\nalso seen in the haem-containing ethanol dehydrogenase. Also\npresent is the invariant residue Trp-230, which in the methanol\ndehydrogenase (Trp-243) and the ethanol dehydrogenase (Trp-\n245) forms the floor of the active-site chamber. In both of these\nenzymes the PQQ is sandwiched between this tryptophan and a\nnovel disulphide ring structure formed from two adjacent cys-\nteines (Cys-103 and Cys-104 in methanol dehydrogenase and\nCys-116 and Cys-117 in the ethanol dehydrogenase) but a notable\ndifference from the sequence of lupanine hydroxylase is that this\nstructure is missing. Such a structure is conserved in many of the\nPQQ enzymes and, because of its rarity in proteins in general, it\nis reasonable to suggest that it has an important biological role\n# 2002 Biochemical Society\n488 D. J. Hopper and others\nFigure 5 Alignment of the amino acid sequence of lupanine hydroxylase (Luphy) with those of the quinohaemoprotein ethanol dehydrogenase from C.\ntestosteroni (Edh-ct) and the quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenase from M. extorquens (Mdh-mex)\nResidues that are common to all three proteins are shaded in black and identical residues in the lupanine hydroxylase and one of the other proteins are shaded grey.

The boxed sequences are the putative haem-binding regions in the cytochrome c domains\nof the two haemoproteins.\nin the quinoproteins. However, there are other PQQ enzymes\nthat also lack this disulphide ring, including the soluble form of\nglucose dehydrogenase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus [23,24]\nand the membrane-bound form of glucose dehydrogenase from\nE. coli [25]. In the latter enzyme a histidine replaces the disulphide\nring in maintaining the position of the PQQ in the active site and\nwhether a similar replacement also occurs in lupanine hydroxy-\nlase must await further structural studies.\nExamination of the C-terminal sequence of about 150 amino\nacids showed the presence of a putative cytochrome c haem-\nbinding sequence (CXXCH) of CGACH from residue 586 to 590\n(Figures 2 and 5). This aligns with a similar sequence in the C.\ntestosteroni ethanol dehydrogenase for which it has been shown\nthat the haem is covalently bound to the cysteines with the\nhistidine providing one of the ligands to the haem iron. The sixth\nligand to the iron is provided by Met-647, which is also conserved\nin the lupanine hydroxylase sequence. A BLAST search of the\ndatabases using the C-terminal domain (residues 551\u2013659) did\nnot show any close matches but there were similarities to the C-\nterminal domains of other quinohaemoproteins, including the\n# 2002 Biochemical Society\n489Lupanine hydroxylase\nalcohol dehydrogenases from Acetobacter and Gluconobacter\n(26% and 30% identities respectively). There were also some\nsimilarities with c-type cytochromes, with cyt\n&&$\nof Cyanidium\ncaldarium and the cyt\n&&#\nprecursor of Nitrosomonas europaea\nappearing the most similar (32% and 30% identities respect-\nively). In a similar analysis of the sequence of the quinohaemo-\nprotein from C. testosteroni, Stoorvogel et al. [6] suggested that\nthe gene might have arisen by the fusion of genes for a\nquinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase and a cytochrome c. This\ninteresting proposal might also be applicable to the lupanine\nhydroxylase gene.\nLupanine is a larger molecule than many of the substrates for\nquinoprotein enzymes. Moreover, it is a tertiary amine that is\ndehydrogenated rather than the alcohol group used by most\nenzymes of this class. Despite this, analysis of the gene shows\nthat lupanine hydroxylase has many similarities with other\nquinoproteins and suggests possible common overall structural\nfeatures. However, there could be detailed differences around the\nactive site, as illustrated by the lack of the disulphide bridge from\nadjacent cysteines. Further structural studies may reveal other\ndifferences. Successful expression of the luh gene in E. coli and\ndevelopment of a procedure for reactivation of the protein will\nnow allow the production of sufficient enzyme for further\nstructural and other studies without restrictions due to insufficient\nlupanine supply.\nWe thank B.
