Starting with the dawn of the modern welfare state early in the 20th century, economists following in the tradition of John Maynard Keynes1 advocated activist countercyclical economic policies: increases in spending or decreases in taxes that are implemented during economic downturns in order to dampen business cycles. The stagflation of the 1970s and the Lucas critique2 marked the beginning of a sea change in thinking about countercyclical policy. Lucas showed why good-intentioned countercyclical policy might be rendered ineffective at best and inflationary at worst by forward-looking rational individuals who adapt to government policymaking. As a result of this feasibility argument, activist countercyclical policy largely fell out of favour in the United States.

Advance Access publication 28 July 2005 doi:10.1093\/ije\/dyi147\nCommentary: The economic business \ncycle and mortality\nEric Neumayer\nThere is much evidence that economic recessions can have\ndetrimental health effects for those losing jobs or in fear of\nlosing their jobs. The unemployed in particular are vulnerable\nas in addition to material losses, they also potentially lose access\nto social networks, self-esteem, self-confidence, and a\nstructured life schedule\u2014all factors known to affect health.1,2\nTherefore, it is natural to presume that population health as\nmeasured by mortality moves counter-cyclically, i.e. one would\nexpect mortality to be up in economic recessions. Yet, there is\nmounting evidence to the contrary: mortality is up in times of\neconomic expansion and down in recession.3\u20137 Importantly, the\ntwo pieces of evidence are not necessarily inconsistent with\neach other. This is because economic upturns can affect the\nhealth of many more people or affect health more strongly, for\nexample, via higher working times, job-related stress, increased\nconsumption of health-damaging consumer goods, and an\nincrease in work-related accidents. Therefore, the overall effect\nof economic expansion on mortality can be negative despite the\nbeneficial health effects of reduced fear of job loss and reduced\nnumber of unemployed people.\nStill, given its seemingly counter-intuitive results, it is\nimportant that the evidence showing mortality rates to move\npro-cyclically is tested in different samples, different time\nperiods, and with different estimation techniques to check its\nrobustness. Tapia Granados6 has provided a valuable addition to\nthis literature. His time-series analysis of mortality rates in the\nUnited States over the period 1900\u20131996 complements nicely\nexisting evidence based on panel data analysis across the states\nin the United States,3 Germany,7 or OECD countries4 from\nshorter time spans as well as other time-series analysis by the\nsame author for Spain and Sweden.5 Time-series analysis\nevidence is perhaps particularly welcome since Brenner\u2019s\ncontrary results suggesting that recessions raise rather than\nlower mortality rates are largely based on time-series analysis as\nwell,8 but note that his research on the issue had started >20\nyears earlier. I particularly like that Tapia Granados6 provides\nestimates both for the entire time period and for selected sub-\nperiods. The fact that the estimated coefficients for the total age-\nadjusted mortality rate do not differ much across time periods is\na striking result, given that most other existent evidence is from\nmuch more recent time periods.\nHowever, time-series analysis poses various econometric\nchallenges that are either non-existent or much less prevalent\nin panel data analysis. Despite space constraints, I would have\nDepartment of Geography and Environment, London School of Economics\nand Political Science, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, UK. \nE-mail: e.neumayer@lse.ac.uk\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on A\nugust 10, 2012\nhttp:\/\/ije.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nliked to see in Tapia Granados a more detailed discussion of\nissues such as the way in which the percentage deviation from\ntrend was computed, the potential use of different and more\nadvanced time-series estimation techniques or of the problem of\nautocorrelation. Concerning the latter, the result from\nregression theory that in the presence of autocorrelation the\nestimated coefficients remain unbiased, invoked by the author,\nis only true as long as the variables are strictly exogenous.\nHowever, the assumption of strict exogeneity is problematic in\nthe face of mounting evidence on the effect that health has\non economic outcomes.9\nIn terms of future research, we need more efforts in two\ndirections. First, we need more evidence from individual rather\nthan aggregate data. Second, we need more research on the\nchannels through which economic expansions negatively affect\nhealth. On both accounts, Ruhm10,11 provides seminal\ncontributions, but much more is needed despite the fact that such\nefforts are data-intensive and work-intensive. We need\nto understand better why recessions lower overall mortality rates\nto an extent that the well-documented negative health effects of\nrecessions for certain sub-groups of the population, particularly\nthe unemployed, are more than compensated. This relates to the\nproper policy conclusions drawn from Tapia Granados\u2019 and\nsimilar findings. Surely, just because mortality is lower in\neconomic recessions does not mean that recessions are desirable\nfrom a health perspective. Instead, we need to focus on how the\nnegative effect of economic upturns on mortality rates can be\nmitigated, if not avoided. Much attention has been paid to the\nnegative health effects of recessions for the unemployed and\nother sub-groups of the population and to the mitigation of these\neffects. Rightly so. But maybe it is time to focus much more on\nhow to mitigate the negative health effects of economic upturns.\nReferences\n1 Brenner MH. Mooney A.
