Frameworks\nsuch as the 'five stage e-moderating model' can be useful in developing the knowledge\nbase but there are dangers in them becoming too reified within an increasingly\ncommodified higher education (HE) environment. The paper calls for greater\nprofessional reflexivity and contestation within learning technology practice and\nconcludes by inviting the ALT-J readership to engage in a critical debate with regard to\nthese issues.\nIntroduction\nThe JCALT report, Career Development of Learning Technology Staff, highlighted 'a lack\nof academic legitimacy' (Beetham, Jones and Gornall, 2001: 6) as being a problem for\nindividuals and the learning technology profession as a whole. Similarly, Oliver (2002: 20)\nhas emphasized that if learning technologists 'cannot establish their credentials with the\nacademics, then it is unlikely that fruitful dialogue will follow, since the collaborator will\nsee them as a service provider rather than an expert'.\nTo achieve the right balance between the pedagogical approach and the appropriate use of\na given technology within the prevailing resource and cultural environment (Beetham et\nal, 2001: 24), learning technologists require effective tools, processes and discourses to\nestablish their professional identity. From the 'world of corporate capital and its\naccompanying ideology' (Taylor, Barr and Steele, 2002: vii) come tools such as virtual\nlearning environments. Although these have all-encompassing toolsets, are easy to use and\ncan be bought 'off the shelf, they arrive with the dangers of an implicit pedagogical bias,\n55\nBernard Usewski and Paul Joyce Examining the five-stage e-moderating model\nthe 'appearance' of innovation and the hegemony of standardization (Conole, Sharp and\nBeharrell, 2002).\nAs well as adopting and using these toolsets effectively in establishing their professional\nand academic presence, learning technologists need to develop a knowledge base which, in\nparticular, informs the process of teaching and learning online. Further to this is the\nchallenge of catering for the 'wide spectrum of capability' (Barker, 2002: 3) of learners that\nis required across different modes of online educational provision.\nIn recent years, the tools, knowledge base and discourse of the learning technology\nprofession has been bolstered by the appearance of conceptual paradigms such as the 'five\nstage e-moderating model' (Salmon, 2000) and the new mantra of 'communities of\npractice' (Wenger, 1998). This paper will argue that, although these frameworks are useful\nin informing and guiding learning technology practice, there are inherent dangers in them\nbecoming too dominant a discourse. The main focus will be on the 'five stage e-moderating\nmodel' as providing an exemplar of a discourse which is in danger of forming a 'grand\nnarrative' (Lyotard, 1984) or totalizing explanation of how to design and deliver online\ntraining programmes. (Recent uncritical citations of the Salmon model across very\ndifferent contexts include: Alexander and Boud, 2001; Arbaugh and Duray, 2002; Barker,\n2002; Bennett and Marsh, 2002; Flecknoe, 2001; Forman, Nyatanga, and Rich, 2002;\nForsyth, 2002; Good, 2001; Hughes and Daykin, 2002; Loveless, Williams, and Kutnick,\n2000; Macdonald, 2002; Slaouti, 2000; and Thorpe, 2002.) In doing so, it thereby\nsimultaneously helps to shape the agenda for legitimizing certain aspects of learning\ntechnology practice.\nThe five stage e-moderating model as a dominant discourse\nIn essence, this paper is a response to an evaluation of a recent online e-moderating\ntraining course run jointly by Salford and Huddersfield Universities within the framework\nof the 'five-stage e-moderating model' (Salmon, 2000). Both institutions 'delivered' the\ncourse to the twenty three participants using the Blackboard virtual learning environment\n(VLE) conferencing facilities. The participants' experiences on the programme were\nevaluated using virtual ethnography (Hine, 2000), focus group and interview\nmethodologies. One of the emergent features of the evaluation was the status which these\ntypes of course (and their embodied models) have within teaching and learning technology\npractice and the ways in which they impact on, and reflect, professional identity.\nThere were several reasons for undertaking the collaborative project. Firstly, we held a\nstrong belief that it is important for potential online tutors to experience fully online\nteaching and learning interaction aimed at developing an advanced state of empathy with\ntheir prospective learner communities. This motive is strongly echoed by Wills, Nouwens,\nDixon and Lefoe (1997: 2):\nStaff should be able to put themselves into the learner's shoes and actively experience\nthe learning environments that are advocated for their students. In order to mainstream\nthese experiences for students, they need to be mainstreamed for staff professional\ndevelopment. Only when staff are comfortable with using a variety of delivery methods\nwill they be able to incorporate them successfully in their own teaching.\n56\nALT-] Volume 11 Number I\nSecondly, the 'five-stage e-moderating model' seemingly offered a useful paradigm for\nstructuring, pacing and situating the developmental experiences of the course participants.\nIt was presented as a usable 'off the shelf product with an inbuilt staged pedagogical\napproach to teaching and learning collaboratively online through computer mediated\nconferencing (CMC), as illustrated in Figure 1.\nDevelopment\nProviding links\notriside closed\nconference\"\nSupporting,\nresponding\nKnowledge construction\nConferencing\nInformation exchange\nSearching,\npersonalising software\nOnline socialisation\nSending and\nreceiving messages\nFamiliarising and prcviding bridges\nbetween cultural, social and\nlearning environments\nFacilitating tasks\nand supporting use\nof teaming miteri ate\nAccess and motivation\nSetting up system\nand accessing\nencouracing\n| I E-Moderating\n\\~JTechnical support\nFigure \/: The five stage e-moderating model of teaching and learning online through computer\nmediated conferencing (reproduced by permission ofGilly Salmon)\nThe reflexive nature of the course - an online course about e-moderating online courses -\nalso highlighted and amplified certain teaching and learning practice issues. For example,\nalthough acknowledging that online collaboration can considerably enhance the learning\nexperience, Laurillard (2002) argues that, in collaborative learning, structure and staged\ntimetabling reduces flexibility, compromising 'normal life' which can lead to feelings of\nguilt and stress as part of the collaborative process.\nThe purpose of the course was to produce e-moderators, or at least to sensitize\npractitioners to the issues surrounding e-moderating online. The process by which this\n57\nBernard Usewski and Paul Joyce Examining the five-stage e-moderating model\ntook place was through a series of stages that increasingly built up greater understanding\nof e-moderation as both e-moderators and as participants on the course. This was\nfacilitated by the use of 'e-tivities' (structured tasks) and reflective processes that\ncorresponded to each of the five stages.\nThe first thing to be said about the evaluation findings is that many of the participants\nviewed their participation in the course in a relatively positive light. The main reason for\nthis was the perceived beneficial experience of 'being on the other side' of the e-learaing\nprocess. As two of the participants stated:\nIn spite of all my negative comments I did enjoy the course . . . I think anything that\nquestions what you do is extremely useful.\nWe should have a policy at the University that no one can put something online until\nthey've done an e-moderating course.\nHowever, as one of the previous comments intimates, whilst experience of the course was\nthought to be beneficial, the course design itself was viewed less favourably. Many thought it\nto be too rigid and restrictive and the five-stage\/five-week structure was considered to be\nproblematic. The demands placed on the participants by e-tivities were unevenly spread across\nthe five weeks. Moreover, the external tutors discouraged deviations from the structure of the\ncourse. As new ideas arose, it became increasingly difficult to change the focus of activity and\nexplore new avenues of thought. A summary of the key findings is presented below:\n\u2022 The five-week timescale (a week allotted to each of the stages) was too restrictive.\n\u2022 Having fallen behind it was hard to catch up.\n\u2022 It was too difficult to change the focus of the course as new ideas arose.\n\u2022 The balance of e-tivities over the five weeks\/stages was problematic - too many time-\nconsuming e-tivities in the later stages.\n\u2022 The course did not take into account individual learning styles.\nAll the evaluation feedback concerns appear to be symptomatic of a deeper tension within\nthe 'five-stage e-moderating model'. The rigidity with which the structure was applied did\nnot sit easily with the demands of the course to be reflective about individual online\nteaching and learning practice. It is paradoxical that a course that presents itself as\nembodying the idea of reflective practice does not seem to be able to employ the same\nmethodology in reflecting upon the efficacy, dominance and legitimacy of the five stage e-\nmoderating model itself. This lack of flexibility and reflexivity is indicative of our deeper\nconcerns about the evolution of the learning technology profession in employing such\nframeworks in its practice.\nReification of pedagogic frameworks\nPrior to pursuing this issue further, there is a need to introduce the process of reification in\nexamining the relationship between designed teaching frameworks and the emergent\nlearning which occurs. In this regard, Wenger (1998: 267) has emphasized that what\nmatters is the 'interaction of the planned and the emergent - that is, the ability of teaching\nand learning to interact so as to become structuring resources for each other'.\n58\nALT-] Volume 11 Number I\nWenger asserts that effective educational practice revolves primarily around forming\n'identities and modes of belonging' rather than in information delivery and skills\nacquisition. In negotiating meaning and forming identity within any learning situation,\nthere lies an ongoing organic inter-relationship between the dualities of reification and\nparticipation. Whilst the latter involves the learner in doing and interacting rather than\nacting passively, the former refers to the process of giving form to experiences by\nproducing objects that codify practice. As Kirkup (2002: 185) states:\nReification is what happens when meaning is projected or solidified through the\nproduction of an object, such as a book, a set of rules, a code of practice, a procedure,\na tool. All these things 'congeal' meaning\/knowledge into a fixed form.\nWenger (1998: 58) outlines the dangers of such processes taking hold:\nThe power of reification - its succinctness, its portability, its potential for physical\npersistence, its focusing effect - is also its danger [. . .] the tool can ossify activity\naround its inertness. Procedures can hide broader meanings in blind sequences of\noperations. And the knowledge of a formula can lead to the illusion that one fully\nunderstands the processes it describes.\nOur concern here is with how the 'five-stage e-moderating model' has become too reified as\na type of product in informing and guiding learning technology practice. There is a danger\nthat such objectified models become 'off the shelf, 'one size fits all' products that are\nseemingly transferable and usable across widely differing teaching and learning contexts and\nas such become unquestionable components of the learning technologist's knowledge base.\nAs Wenger (1998: 65) notes, if one is exposed to too much reification, 'there may not be\nenough overlap in participation to recover a co-ordinated, relevant, or generative meaning'.\nHowever, there are clearly organizational benefits to reification. If certain elements of\nprofessional practice have been reified to the point of standardization or even to become a\ncommercial product (as the e-moderating course appeared to be), then they may be the\nsafest option when deciding on future organizational strategies aimed at improving\nlearning technology practice. The existence of an established 'off the shelf product\nacceptable to professional peers saves time in having to devise bespoke solutions to\nperceived problems. It is understandable that time-constrained academics may demand\nthese products, but alongside them comes the need to develop new pedagogies, new\nteaching identities (Bayne, 2002) and more collaborative working practices underpinned by\nappropriate support mechanisms, organizational frameworks and realistic resource\nallocations. In effect, what is required is a 'reconceptualisation of academic practices'\n(Land, 2000: 22) given that, as Oliver (2002: 20) asserts, learning technologists are involved\nin the 'core work of collaborative curriculum development'.\nFurthermore, the danger is that in relying too much on 'off the shelf solutions, such reified\nmodels become the dominant structural paradigm in informing and defining professional\nidentity and practice. Interestingly, Jean Lave - long-time colleague of Wenger - has\nrecently expressed similar concerns about how the concept of 'communities of practice', in\nacting as a structural metaphor for organizing educational practice, has been taken up and\nimposed in a top-down way in educational settings as a sort of model of 'good pedagogy'\n(Lea and Nicholl, 2002:10).\n59\nBernard Usewski and Paul Joyce Examining the five-stage e-moderating model\nInforming and guiding online teaching and learning practice\nThe experience of our course participants highlights the dangers of taking a framework\nsuch as the five-stage model and using it as a template or object, that is, allowing it to act as\na 'grand narrative or totalizing explanation' for designing the online teaching and learning\nenvironment when using CMC. This model emerged from an action research methodology\nwithin the context of the UK Open University Business School's online programmes.\nUsing content analysis and focus group work, the model 'provided a set of constructs that\ncould be tested as well as a basis for later online induction and training programmes' and\n'applies to all CMC software' (Salmon, 2000: 23 and 26).\nHowever, George and Cowan (1999:20) draw a comparison between action research which\nis 'restricted to particular subjects, teachers and situations . . . and educational research\nwhich pushes what is known about education, and hence contributes to the enhancement\nof informed professional practice'. This distinction raises the question of whether the five-\nstage model offers general transferability of educational practice across widely differing\nteaching and learning contexts and, as such, significantly contributes to, and legitimizes,\nimportant pedagogic processes within the learning technology profession.\nThe question for learning technology practitioners in seeking to address contemporary\nteaching and learning challenges is how to obtain the appropriate duality between\nparticipation and reification. Or perhaps, more pertinently, how to strike the balance\nbetween professional legitimacy and autonomy with reification. Although the e-\nmoderating course experience described earlier is just a single example, it does fit into a\nrecognized pattern of activities within the profession. The preponderance of uncontested\nmodels (such as the Salmon model or the ongoing VLE\/MLE determinism) and voguish\ntheorizing (Wenger included) have much in common with the faddish behaviour in other\ndisciplines, business and management studies being the most obvious. The problem is: what\ndoes this imply about the present state of learning technology practice? The dominance of\nreified 'off the shelf solutions and theoretical faddishness sits uneasily with discipline-\nbased notions of reflective practice and concepts such as the 'learning organization'. Is this\na case of a new, immature profession finding its feet and establishing a body of knowledge\nand expertise that informs professional practice? Or is professional learning technology\npractice being driven by the need to find quick and easy solutions to the massification of\nthe higher education experience? In many ways, these questions reflect the wider fears of\nthe academic community with regard to the 'managerial colonization' and 'commodifica-\ntion' of the higher education teaching and learning process (Prichard and Willmott, 1997;\nBarry, Chandler and Clark, 2001; Chandler, Barry and Clark, 2002). Similarly, alongside\nthese anxieties, Land and Bayne (2001: 8) argue that the very 'ethos of the MLE can be\nviewed as . . . essentially managerialist. It is about order, efficiency, identified outcomes and\ncontrol.'\nWe believe that there are great dangers in too much codification and commodification in\nthe process of explaining teaching and learning relationships, whether it be in a face-to-\nface or an online context, especially given the need - as Ramsden (1992), Biggs (1999),\nRowland (2000) and Knight (2002) emphasize - to develop teaching strategies for higher\neducation which are aimed at 'promoting complex learning'. Ramsden (1992: 267) in\nparticular argues:\n60\nALT-] Volume 11 Number \/\nThe development of good teaching involves a [. . .] process of change from simple to\ncomplex, from absolute to relative, from unquestioning acceptance of authority to a\nsearch for personal meaning, from discrete techniques to the expression of skills within\nan ordered, yet ultimately provisional system.\nSimilarly, Prosser and Trigwell (1999:168) have asserted:\nGood teaching is not about applying predetermined recipes, techniques or templates to\nlearning and teaching situations. Each learning and teaching situation is unique.\nFurther to this, Shulman (1987: 11), in examining the sources of the knowledge base for\nestablishing teaching legitimacy, states:\nDiscovering, explicating, and codifying general teaching principles simplify the\notherwise outrageously complex activity of teaching. The great danger occurs [. . .]\nwhen a general teaching principle is distorted into prescription, when maxim becomes\nmandate.\nThe esoteric, emergent and complex technical knowledge that forms the basis of\nprofessional identity within the teaching and learning relationship is not immune to being\nultimately broken down into simple tasks and standardization (Freidson, 1994). It is not\ndesirable in many pedagogic circumstances to do this, but it is not unreasonable to believe\nthat when new forms of management discourse arise, commodification or reification of\nprofessional activity may take place. Furthermore, different forms of professional expertise\nmay be promoted that undermine longstanding patterns of professional conduct to meet\nnew political agendas or the challenge of newly formulated problems.\nSearching for 'academic legitimacy': the need for greater reflexivity\nand contestation in learning technology practice\nWe acknowledge that we have to be vigilant here and not throw the baby out with the\nbathwater in examining the role of models and frameworks in learning technology\npractice. Codified and commodified models can inform and guide our practice by acting as\n'objectified comfort blankets' in helping to establish legitimacy for the learning technology\nprofession by building up its knowledge base. However, there are dangers in prescription\n(Knight, 2002: 217), given that 'talk of complexity and contingency [. . .] combine to\nsuggest that the quintessence of teaching eludes commodification and measurement'.\nThere is an immediate need to promote much greater professional reflexivity in using such\nmodels, allied to fostering more subversion, contestation and appropriation of these\nframeworks within local contexts - particularly given an increasing 'off the shelf\nmanagerialist agenda. As Wenger (1998: 9) argues:\nA key implication of our attempts to organise learning is that we must become\nreflective with regard to our own discourses of learning and to their effects on the ways\nwe design for learning.\nEven if we accept such models as the five-stage one as providing useful frameworks, should\nthey always be represented as a set of fixed stages, phases or steps generally applicable to a\nwide variety of teaching and learning contexts? For example, Shulman (1987: 19), when\nreferring to his own model of teaching - comprehension, transformation, instruction,\n61\nBernard L\/sewsfci and Paul Joyce Examining the five-stage e-moderating model\nevaluation and reflection - reflexively comments that 'many of the processes can occur in a\ndifferent order. Some may not occur at all during some acts of teaching. Some may be\ntruncated, others elaborated.'\nWithin any 'design for learning'process, one needs to strive for the correct balance between\nreification and participation or structure and empowerment on behalf of the learner\nwithin the local teaching and learning context. Effectively, it becomes a decision around\n'when to reify and when to rely on participation' (Wenger, 1998: 265) in pursuit of the\nnegotiation of meaning, rather than decisions about transmitting information and\npromoting skills acquisition.\nThe wider question for the learning technology profession is how it wishes to establish its\n'academic legitimacy' within an increasingly dominant managerial discourse. It is evident\nthat the profession has grown in influence and complexity in recent years (Beetham et al,\n2001; Oliver, 2002). More significantly, the rhetoric surrounding changes in the\norganization of higher education has much in common with how the profession sees itself.\nThe concept of the 'learning organization', often applied to higher education in terms of\nquality management, is a product of the same ideas of reflexive practice that can be\napplied to idealized professional practice. So, at least superficially, the learning technology\nprofession shares some of the key ideals of the new managerial discourse. In addition, it\nhas to be said that many of the critical stances against the new forms of higher education\nmanagement are produced by academics and concern themselves with their loss of\nacademic power. They say very little about alternative sources of pedagogic expertise, such\nas the learning technologist being viewed as a 'service provider rather than an expert'\n(Oliver, 2002: 20).\nIn many ways, the concept of 'alternative pedagogic expertise' is key to understanding the\ndevelopment of the learning technology profession. In order to be taken seriously as a\nprofession, or as seriously as the profession thinks it ought to be taken, there has to be a\nclaim made for some form of validation. What is not clear in terms of learning technology\nis the pathway that the profession has to follow in order to pursue this goal of validation\nand legitimacy. As Beetham et al (2001: 69) point out, 'there were conflicting strategies for\nthe (agreed) objective of raising credibility, validation and legitimacy for learning\ntechnology work'. However, what cannot be overlooked is that the very notions of validity\nand legitimacy within professions are not given or 'taken for granted'. The profession (or\nthose who employ the profession) may present them as such to forestall external challenge,\nbut the ideas of validity and legitimacy still remain highly contested and contestable.\nMoreover, the pathways to validation and legitimacy themselves create the discursive space\nthat will eventually define professional practice. Claims for legitimacy by professional\nbodies cannot be divorced from the application of the expert knowledge they seek to\nregulate and dominate. Equally, professional practice cannot be viewed as separate from\nthe concept of authority and the exercise of power. Therefore, it is clear that the route to\nprofessionalism defines practice and ultimately identity. For a new profession, such as\nlearning technologists, the pitfalls are all too clear. In the higher education setting, the\ntemptation is to 'go native' (Beetham et al, 2001: 69) and follow the classic path of\nresearch and self-regulation through academic journals and peer review to become a quasi-\nacademic discipline. However, the route to legitimacy within higher education does not\ntake place within a power vacuum: the terrain is already occupied and to some extent\n62\nALT-J Volume 11 Number I\nmapped by competing professional interests - political, managerial and educational. To\nbecome part of this professional milieu may mean that the pathway to validation and\nlegitimization is not totally at the discretion of learning technologists themselves. The\nprofession may have to align itself with one or other of the dominant professions (such as\nthe new managerial discourse) in order to fulfil its own professional goals.\nHowever, once again there are dangers in reification, or what Webb (1996: 109) refers to in\nthis particular context as a process of 'credentialing' within educational development\npractice. As he states, 'the fear is that a drive to professionalism will lead to conformity and\nfear of difference, rather than contest and innovation'.\nThere is currently little evidence that learning technology as a profession will supplant or\neven equal 'academic power' in higher education, but the new pedagogic technologies, such\nas VLEs and MLEs and all aspects of e-learaing, have become central to delivering quality\nmass education. The profession that mediates these technologies is ideally placed to stake a\nclaim in the new hierarchies of power. However, there is something of a paradox, in that as\nstated earlier many of these technologies are highly reified. As a profession, what does this\nsuggest about future development? The learning technology profession as a coherent body\nof expertise is a relatively new phenomenon, even if its practices are increasingly in\ndemand. Will the onset of maturity bring with it a degree of autonomy of practice within\nhigher education? Or will the profession be increasingly defined by a powerful managerial\ndiscourse and become more closely aligned to the power hierarchy, with all the benefits and\nprestige that ensue, but at the price of professional freedom? These are some of the\nquestions that need to be explored empirically.\nWe are in agreement with Taylor et al. (2002) that, in developing learning technologists'\nknowledge base and 'academic legitimacy', there is a need to foster the growth of 'social\nprocesses and epistemological communities' within our professional networks.\nConclusion: or is it the start?\nBy using the 'five-stage e-moderating model' as an exemplar, we have attempted to\nhighlight the dangers of adopting an over-codified, 'off-the-shelf', 'one-size-fits-all'\napproach to educational development, even though such adoption is understandable\nwithin an increasingly commodified higher education environment.\nFor a relatively new profession trying to establish itself within the academic community\nand culture, we need to be more self-critical of the 'body of knowledge' and practice that\nwe are drawing upon and seeking to legitimize. For example, is the 'five-stage e-moderating\nmodel' becoming too reified to the point of commodification? A similar question could be\naddressed to the 'off the shelf mentality associated with VLEs which has also become a\nprevailing driving force within current teaching and learning practice.\nAlthough such toolsets can invest in us 'gravitas in the form of codified products' and\nvirginal legitimacy amongst our peers, as a neophyte profession we need to establish a more\nself-reflexive, questioning, contestable and research-based ethos of practice. Perhaps, given\nour relative youth as a profession it is understandable that the five-stage model of online\ninteraction has become a dominant paradigm for one area of our practice. However, this\narea may simply be one of many that we have yet to 'receive' and contest.\n63\nBernard U'sewsfa' and Paul Joyce Examining the five-stage e-moderating model\nIn seeking to establish frameworks for, and pathways to, legitimacy for the learning tech-\nnology profession, we recognize that an article such as this could itself become too reified to\nachieve these aims. Thus, rather than ending with assertions, we invite reflection and\ndiscussion through response to the following questions for learning technology practitioners:\n\u2022 How comfortable are you using these types of tools, models and discourses in your\nprofessional practice?\n\u2022 How should learning technologists be legitimized and identified by these tools, models\nand discourses?\n\u2022 What does the concept of 'academic legitimacy' mean for the learning technology\nprofession and how should it be achieved?\n\u2022 Does a relatively new profession need gurus and artefacts?\n\u2022 What is the knowledge construction process for the learning technology profession?\n\u2022 How should we seek to establish the learning technology role given that it often seems\nto be 'hybrid, marginal and yet central to institutional processes of change'?
