The theory is compactified on a\nT 6\/ZN \u00d7 ZM orbifold. In addition worldsheet parity in combination with a reflection of three\ncompact directions is modded out. Tadpole cancellation requires to add D-6-branes at angles.\nThe resulting four dimensional theories are N = 1 supersymmetric and non-chiral.\n1 Introduction\nOne of the major issues in string theory is to classify consistent theories in especially 3+1\ndimensions. Insights into strong coupling regions of string theory provide reasons to hope that\napparently different models are actually equivalent and can be mapped onto each other by\nduality transformations. Often, strong and weak coupling regions are interchanged in this pro-\ncess. Open strings with Dirichlet boundary conditions e.g. provide a perturbative description of\nsolitonic (non-perturbative) objects (D-p-branes) in type II string theories[1]. This observation\nwas crucial for one of the first conjectures about string dualities - the heterotic\/type I duality[2].\nSince compactifications of the heterotic string are of particular phenomenological interest one\nexpects the same for type I compactifications. Here, one typically starts with a type II the-\nory on an orbifold. In addition, worldsheet parity (possibly combined with discrete targetspace\ntransformations) is modded out. The consistency requirement of modular invariance is replaced\nby tadpole cancellation conditions. The resulting models are called orientifolds. This kind of\nconstruction has been considered already some time ago[3\u20137]. The first formulation using the\nmodern language of D-branes and Orientifold fixed planes was given in[8]. Subsequently, sev-\neral models with different numbers of non-compact dimensions and unbroken supersymmetries\nhave been constructed e.g. in[9\u201317].\nIn orientifolds the amount of unbroken supersymmetry depends on the orbifold group and\nthe arrangement of D-branes and O-planes needed for consistent compactifications. In[18]\nit was pointed out that also D-branes intersecting at angles can leave some supersymmetries\nunbroken. A concrete realization of this observation in orientifold constructions was worked out\nin [19, 20]. These authors considered type IIB (IIA) string theory on T 4\/ZN (T\n6\/ZN ) orbifolds\nwith N = 3, 4, 6. In addition, they gauged worldsheet parity together with the reflection of\ntwo (three) directions of the T 4\/ZN (T\n6\/ZN) orbifold such that this reflection leaves O-planes\nintersecting at angles fixed. To cancel the corresponding RR-charges, D-branes intersecting at\nangles need to be added. In the present paper we are going to supplement this class of models\nby compactifying type IIA on a T 6\/ (ZN \u00d7 ZM ) orbifold together with imposing invariance\nunder worldsheet parity inversion combined with the reflection of three orbifold directions.\nWe will discuss only models with N = 1 supersymmetry in four dimensions. All possible\ncompactifications of this kind yield non-chiral four dimensional models with different gauge\ngroups and matter content.\nIn the next section we describe general features of the construction. The third section is\ndevoted to a detailed study of the Z4\u00d7Z2 orientifold. Subsequently, we briefly give results for all\nother consistent models, viz. the Z2\u00d7Z2, Z6\u00d7Z3 and the Z3\u00d7Z3 orientifolds. We conclude by\nsummarizing our results. Three appendices provide technical details of the considered models:\nappendix A is addressed to the computation of loop channel diagrams, appendix B contains\ntables of massless spectra, and appendix C describes a projective representation used for the\nZ4 \u00d7 Z2 orientifold.\n1\n2 General Setup\nThroughout the paper we will discuss models with four non-compact dimensions labeled by x\u00b5,\n\u00b5 = 0, . . . , 3. In addition, there are six compact directions which we describe by three complex\ncoordinates,\nz1 = x4 + ix5 , z2 = x6 + ix7 , z3 = x8 + ix9. (1)\nEach of those coordinates describes a torus T 2. In addition, points on these tori are identified\nunder rotations\n\u03981 : z\nj \u2192 e2\u03c0ivjzj , \u03982 : zj \u2192 e2\u03c0iwjzj , (2)\nwhere (\u03981,\u03982) denotes an element of the orbifold group ZN \u00d7ZM . (The action on the complex\nconjugated coordinates just follows from the conjugation of (2).) We will discuss type IIA\ntheories on these manifolds. In addition, we gauge the symmetry generated by \u2126R where \u2126\nreverses worldsheet parity, and R reflects the imaginary parts of the zi,\nR : zi \u2192 z\u00afi. (3)\nThe gauging of \u2126R creates Orientifold fixed planes (O-planes). The location of those planes is\ngiven by sets of points fixed under the elements of \u2126R \u00d7 ZN \u00d7 ZM . These fixed planes carry\nRR-charges which must be canceled by adding D-branes to the model[1, 8]. One of these O-\nplanes is extended along the non-compact directions and the real parts of the zi. It is invariant\nunder the R reflection. To visualize the remaining O-planes we note that (I = 1, 2)\n\u2126R\u0398I : zi = (\u0398I)\u2212\n1\n2 \u2126R (\u0398I)\n1\n2 : zi (4)\nwhere the powers of \u00b11\n2\nindicate that the rotations are performed with plus-minus half the angle\nas compared to (2). Thus, a fixed plane under \u2126R\u0398I is obtained by acting with (\u0398I)\u2212\n1\n2 on\nthe set of points fixed under R. Therefore (starting from the O-6-plane at zi = z\u00afi, i = 1, 2, 3),\none obtains a set of O-6-planes intersecting at angles, whose values are given by half the order\nof the corresponding ZN \u00d7 ZM element. Since all these O-6-planes have compact transverse\ndirections and carry RR-charges, one expects that for consistency one needs to include a certain\namount of D-6-branes canceling exactly those charges. These D-6-branes need to be parallel to\nthe O-6-planes and hence also intersect at angles. Indeed, for ZN orbifolds this has been shown\nto be the case[19, 20]. In the following sections we will generalize those models to ZN \u00d7 ZM\norbifolds. This turns out to be a straightforward modification of the discussion given in[19, 20].\nA new ingredient, however, is that in some cases more complicated projective representations\nof the orientifold group in the open string sector are needed. This has been observed before in\nsome ZN \u00d7 ZM orientifolds of type IIB models[11, 15]. In fact, for the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 model to be\ndiscussed in section 4 we will obtain the T-dual version of the model of[11].\nIn the next paragraphs we are going to review some of the technical aspects necessary for\norientifold constructions. The main consistency requirement comes from RR charge conser-\nvation. Technically, it translates into the tadpole cancellation condition[8]. The RR charges\ndescribe the size of the couplings of O-planes and D-branes to RR gauge fields. The numerical\n2\nvalue of these couplings can be computed by extracting the RR exchange contribution to the\nforces acting between O-planes and D-branes[1]. A convenient way of computing these forces\nis to move to the open string loop channel. There, the RR charge of O-planes and D-branes\ncan be extracted from the UV-limits of the following parts of the Klein bottle, Mo\u00a8bius strip\nand annulus diagrams[21]:\nKlein bottle: Closed string NSNS states with P\u2126R (\u2212)F insertion\nMo\u00a8bius strip: Open string R states with \u2212P\u2126R insertion\nAnnulus: Open string NS states with P(\u2212)F insertion\n(5)\nHere, (\u2212)F is the fermion number to be defined below. (For closed strings (\u2212)F = (\u2212)FL =\n(\u2212)FR because of the presence of \u2126 in the trace.) Further, we denote by P the projector on\nstates invariant under the orbifold group ZN \u00d7 ZM . The requirement of tadpole cancellation\ndetermines the number of D-6-branes and part of the representation of the orientifold group on\nthe Chan Paton indices.\nAnother essential consistency condition is what is called \u201ccompletion of the projector in\nthe tree channel\u201d in[19]. Let us briefly recall their arguments. The important diagrams are\ndrawn in figure 1. The notation is taken from[8]. Orbifold group elements are denoted by h\nor g. In the tree channel picture the crosscaps correspond to O-planes invariant under \u2126Rh.\nD-branes are assigned a letter i or j. The orbifold group element g denotes the twist sector of\nthe closed strings propagating in the tree channel. (For further details see[8].) Consistency of\nthe boundary conditions requires\n(\u2126Rh1)2 = (\u2126Rh2)2 = g (6)\nin the Klein bottle diagram and\n(\u2126Rh)2 = g (7)\nin the Mo\u00a8bius strip. For the class of orientifolds discussed here, the lhs of (6) and (7) are\nthe identity. Hence, in the tree channel only untwisted closed strings propagate in the Klein\nbottle and in the Mo\u00a8bius strip. Since these must be invariant under the orbifold group, the\ntree channel amplitude must contain the insertion of the complete projector on invariant states.\nThe actual calculation of the diagrams depicted in figure 1 will be done in the loop channel,\nwhere worldsheet time is vertical. Transforming back to the tree channel one must recover\nthe insertion of the complete projector mentioned above. For the Klein bottle amplitude this\nrequirement leads to restrictions on the possible orbifold lattices. In the Mo\u00a8bius strip one\nobtains further conditions for the representation of the orientifold group on the Chan-Paton\nmatrices.\nFinally, let us introduce some notation and definitions which we mainly borrow from[20].\nThe action of the orientifold group on closed string degenerate ground states1 is specified by\nR : |s0, s1, s2, s3\u3009 \u2192 |s0,\u2212s1,\u2212s2,\u2212s3\u3009\n\u03981 : |s0, s1, s2, s3\u3009 \u2192 e2\u03c0i~v\u00b7~s |s0, s1, s2, s3\u3009 (8)\n\u03982 : |s0, s1, s2, s3\u3009 \u2192 e2\u03c0i~w\u00b7~s |s0, s1, s2, s3\u3009\n1All states are in light cone gauge. The first entry in the state corresponds to two non-compact directions,\nwhereas the other three belong to the three complex compact directions.\n3\n\u2126Rh\na)\n\u2126Rh1 g \u2126Rh2\ng\nb)\nc)\ng\ni\ni j\nFigure 1: a) Klein bottle, b) Mo\u00a8bius strip, c) Cylinder\nWorldsheet parity inversion \u2126 interchanges the left with the right moving sector.

S denotes the space time\nfermion number. In order to compute the contribution due to RR exchange in the tree channel\none needs to compute the parts of expressions (10), (11) and (12) which are given in (5). (The\nspace time fermion number insertion has been taken care of by the minus sign in the second\nline in (5).) The transformation back to the tree channel is performed by replacing t = 1\n4l\nfor\nthe Klein bottle, t = 1\n8l\nfor the Mo\u00a8bius strip and t = 1\n2l\nfor the annulus[8]. Finally RR-charge\nconservation is imposed by demanding the infrared (l \u2192\u221e) limit of the tree channel expression\nto be finite.\n4\n3 The Z4 \u00d7 Z2 \u2126R\u2013Orientifold\nIn this section we discuss the Z4 \u00d7 Z2 model in great detail because in this case all possible\nsubtleties show up; therefore the other models can be treated briefly in the following sections.\nThe lattice described by the shifts ~v = (1\/4,\u22121\/4, 0) for the Z4-factor and ~w = (0, 1\/2,\u22121\/2)\nfor the Z2-factor of the orbifold-group is essentially an SU(2)\n6-lattice, i.e. a product of three\ntori in the notation of complex compact coordinates. The two crystallographically allowed\norientations A and B of one of the three tori with respect to the reflection R are shown in\nfigure 2. As will be explained in the following, the only pertubatively consistent models are\ngiven by the choices ABA and ABB for the compact directions2.\nA B\n3\n1 3\n24\n1\n4\n2\nFigure 2: Lattices for Z4 \u00d7 Z2. Black circles denote the Z4 fixed points and white circles the\nadditional Z2 fixed points.\n3.1 The Klein bottle amplitude\nWe begin with evaluating the general expression (10) for the Klein bottle 1-loop amplitude of\nthe Z4\u00d7Z2 model by considering the compact momenta. The Kaluza-Klein (KK) and winding\n(W) states are generally given by\nP =\n\u221a\n2\nr\n(m1 ~e1\n\u2217 +m2 ~e2\n\u2217) , (14)\nW =\nr\u221a\n2\u03b1\u2032\n(n1 ~e1 + n2 ~e2) , (15)\nwhere mi and ni are integers, ~ei are the basis vectors of the corresponding torus with radius r\nand ~ei\n\u2217 are the basis vectors of the dual torus (i = 1, 2). The SU(2)2 lattices in figure 2 are\nspanned by\n~e1\nA =\n( \u221a\n2\n0\n)\n, ~e2\nA =\n(\n0\u221a\n2\n)\n, (16)\n~e1\nB =\n(\n1\n\u22121\n)\n, ~e2\nB =\n(\n1\n1\n)\n, (17)\n2The choices BAA and BAB are equivalent to these models.\n5\nwith the corresponding dual basis. For the Kaluza-Klein and winding states invariant under\n\u2126R one gets\nPA =\nm\nr\n(\n1\n0\n)\n, WA =\nnr\n\u03b1\u2032\n(\n0\n1\n)\n, (18)\nPB =\n\u221a\n2m\nr\n(\n1\n0\n)\n, WB =\n\u221a\n2nr\n\u03b1\u2032\n(\n0\n1\n)\n, (19)\nwhere m,n are integers. As a consequence of relation (4) the states (18) and (19) are invariant\nunder the insertions \u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 for k1 = 0, 2 and k2 = arbitrary; when A and B are exchanged,\nthese states are invariant under insertions with k1 = 1, 3 and k2 = arbitrary. From\npL,R = P \u00b1W (20)\nfor the closed string, it follows that the lattice contribution to the 1-loop amplitude for the Klein\nbottle is L[1, 1] for A-states and L[2, 2] for B-states, where the notation is taken from[19, 20]\nand explained in appendix A. In general, lattice contributions only appear for untwisted tori.\nThe calculation of the oscillator contributions to (10) simplifies if one takes into account that\nthe RR-exchange in the tree level is given by the trace over the NSNS-sector with the insertion\n(\u22121)F in the 1-loop channel. Furthermore, the elements of the orbifold group Z4 \u00d7 Z2 act as\nthe unit operator on the oscillator states which contribute to the trace because \u2126R-invariance\nleads to a cancellation of the phases given in equation (8) between left- and right-movers. This\nmeans that the oscillator contributions are equal for any insertion from the orbifold group.\nAlthough the numerical results may be zero from case to case, all the twisted sectors formally\nshow up in the amplitude, because \u2126R does not exchange them. The last ingredients we\nneed are the multiplicities \u03c7\n(n1,k1)(n2,k2)\nK of the \u0398\nn1\n1 \u0398\nn2\n2 -twisted fixed points which are invariant\nunder the insertion \u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 . Consider e.g. the second torus T2 twisted by \u03982. In the A-\nlattice, two of the four fixed points are interchanged under \u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 when k1 = 0, 2 and\nk2 = arbitrary. In the B-lattice all four fixed points are invariant under these insertions, such\nthat \u03c7\n(0,0)(1,k2)\nK = \u03c7\n(0,2)(1,k2)\nK = 2(4) for an A(B)-type T2. The resulting multiplicities are shown\nin table 1. Considering all this, we can evaluate the Klein bottle 1-loop amplitude (10). The\nnotation is similar to[19, 20] and defined in appendix A. We use the fact that for the oscillator\ncontributions K(n1,k1)(n2,k2) = K(n1,0)(n2,0) is valid for all ni, ki (i = 1, 2) as explained above and\nsimplify the notation by defining K(n1,n2) \u2261 K(n1,0)(n2,0)).

At this point we can clarify, why only the models ABA and ABB (and the\nequivalent models BAA and BAB) are perturbatively consistent. The lattice contribution of\ne.g. AAA is changed to BBA by the insertion of \u03981 and there is no way to get the complete\nprojector. From the same argument it follows that only the orbifold groups Z2 \u00d7 Z2, Z4 \u00d7 Z2,\nZ3 \u00d7 Z3 and Z6 \u00d7 Z3 can lead to perturbatively consistent solutions.\n3.2 The annulus amplitude\nTo cancel the tadpoles which arise in the Klein bottle amplitude we need to introduce D-branes.\nAs was found in[19, 20] and explained in section 2 for the orientifold models under consideration\nwe have to introduce D-6-branes rotated by half the angles which are given by the elements of\n7\nthe orbifold group. For Z4\u00d7Z2 this leads to a configuration of eight different D-6-branes whose\nlocations in the three compact tori are shown in figure 3. For simplicity we restrict ourselves to\nthe case where the D-branes are located at the fixed points. Writing down the mode expansions\ne.g. for an open string stretching from brane (0, 0) to brane (1, 0) (where the brane (1, 0) is\nrotated by \u0398\n\u22121\/2\n1 with respect to the brane (0, 0)) one realizes that the modings are the same\nas for the closed string twisted by \u0398\u221211 . Therefore it is convenient to call these kinds of open\nstrings \u201ctwisted sectors\u201d[19], as we will do in the following. Using these conventions, an open\nstring stretching from brane (i1, i2) to brane (i1 \u2212 n1, i2 \u2212 n2) belongs to the \u0398n11 \u0398n22 -twisted\nsector.\n(3, 0)\n(1, 1)\n\u03981 \u03982\n\u03981\n\u03982\nT1 T2 T3\n(0, 0)\n(2, 1)\n(0, 0)\n(1, 0)\n(2, 0)\n(3, 0)\n(0, 0)\n(0, 1)\n(2, 0)\n(2, 1)\n(2, 0)\n(0, 1)\n(0, 1)\n(1, 1)\n(2, 1)\n(3, 1)\n(1, 0)\n(3, 1)\n(3, 0)\n(3, 1)\n(1, 0)\n(1, 1)\nFigure 3: Arrangement of branes and action of the orbifold group for Z4 \u00d7 Z2. The branes are\nlabelled by (i1, i2) = (0, 0), . . . , (3, 1) mod (4, 2). This is convenient in the sense that the brane\n(i1, i2) is obtained by rotating the compact real axes with \u0398\n\u2212i1\/2\n1 \u0398\n\u2212i2\/2\n2 , see also section 2.\nFor the open string the compact momenta popen are given by the distance of parallel D-\n6-branes in the corresponding directions. Therefore we consider the location of the branes in\nthe fundamental cells of the lattices A and B, see figure 4. Starting from brane (0, 0), we\nBA\nFigure 4: Location of branes in the fundamental cells for Z4 \u00d7 Z2\nget pAopen = P\nA for the directions 4,6,8 and pAopen = W\nA for the directions 5,7,9 as well as\npBopen =\n1\n2\nPB (4,6,8) and pBopen =\n1\n2\nWB (5,7,9), see equations (18) and (19). It follows, that the\nlattice contribution to the 1-loop amplitude for the annulus is given by L[2, 2] for an A-torus\nand by L[1, 1] for a B-torus. The compact momenta are nonzero again only for untwisted tori,\ni.e. tori where the twist acts trivially. But in addition, the D-branes have to be invariant under\n8\ninsertions of the elements of the orbifold group, therefore only the insertions 1I, \u039821, \u03982 and\n\u039821\u03982 yield non-vanishing compact momenta on untwisted tori.\nCalculating the oscillator contributions to (11) we again focus on the RR-exchange in the\ntree channel which is given by the trace over the NS-sector with (\u22121)F insertion in the 1-\nloop amplitude. All twisted sectors appear, each in combination with the insertions 1I, \u039821, \u03982\nand \u039821\u03982 which leave the D-branes invariant, as stated above. In contrast to the Klein bottle\namplitude the phases arising from the insertions are not cancelled. Moreover, the representation\nmatrices of the orbifold group have to be taken into account. These matrices are unitaryM\u00d7M\nmatrices, whereM is the number of arrangements that will be fixed by the tadpole cancellation\nconditions. In the amplitude the matrices appear as\ntr\u03b3\n(i1\u2212n1,i2\u2212n2)\nk1k2\ntr\u03b3\n(i1,i2)\u22121\nk1k2\n, (24)\nwhere (i1, i2) labels the eight different branes and n1 and n2 indicate the \u0398\nn1\n1 \u0398\nn2\n2 -twisted sector,\nas explained above. \u03b3\n(i1,i2)\nk1k2\nis an abbreviation for \u03b3\n(i1,i2)\n\u0398\nk1\n1 \u0398\nk2\n2\n. This leads to a factor of 8M2 for the\nuntwisted and twisted sectors without insertions (\u201cwithout\u201d means insertion of 1I in the case of\nthe annulus), where the 8 arises from the number of branes in the arrangement (see figure 3).\nIn fact, all the calculations can be done starting with brane (0, 0) and inserting factors of 8\nappropriately, because the other branes lead to the same amplitudes.\nThe terms with insertions lead to twisted sector tadpoles in the tree-channel, which can-\nnot be cancelled by the other diagrams. This yields the twisted sector tadpole cancellation\nconditions\ntr\u03b3\n(i1,i2)\n20 = tr\u03b3\n(i1,i2)\n01 = tr\u03b3\n(i1,i2)\n21 = 0 (25)\nfor all (i1, i2), similar to[8].\nThe analogue to the multiplicities of fixed points in the closed string are the intersection\nnumbers of the D-branes in the open string case. The intersection numbers are given by the\nnumber of times that the branes intersect within the fundamental cell and can be read off easily\nfrom figure 4. Starting with brane (0, 0), a Z2-twisted B-type torus contributes a factor of two,\nwhereas a Z2-twisted A-type torus and Z4-twisted tori of both types contribute a factor of one\n3.\nAgain, only the points invariant under insertions contribute, thus in the case of the annulus\nonly sectors without insertions appear in the amplitude and it is sufficient to consider the\nmultiplicities \u03c7\n(n1,n2)\nA \u2261 \u03c7(n1,0)(n2,0)A which are given in table 2.

Again, the\ncomplete projector shows up.\n3.3 The Mo\u00a8bius strip amplitude\nIn the case of the Mo\u00a8bius strip, the compact momenta for a B-torus have to be doubled in\nthe 5,7,9 directions because of the \u2126R-projection, therefore one gets L[2, 2] for an A-torus and\nL[1, 4] for a B-torus. Again, the lattice contributions only appear for untwisted tori and for\ninsertions which leave the D-6-branes invariant.\nWhich strings contribute to the Mo\u00a8bius strip one-loop amplitude? Let us denote a \u0398n11 \u0398\nn2\n2 -\ntwisted string by [(i1, i2)(i1\u2212 n1, i2\u2212n2)] as explained in section 3.2 and consider the action of\n10\nthe insertion \u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 thereupon:\n[(i1, i2)(i1 \u2212 n1, i2 \u2212 n2)]\n\u0398\nk1\n1 \u0398\nk2\n2\n- [(i1 + 2k1, i2 + 2k2)(i1 \u2212 n1 + 2k1, i2 \u2212 n2 + 2k2)]\nR\n- [(\u2212i1 \u2212 2k1,\u2212i2 \u2212 2k2)(\u2212i1 + n1 \u2212 2k1,\u2212i2 + n2 \u2212 2k2)]\n\u2126\n- [(\u2212i1 + n1 \u2212 2k1,\u2212i2 + n2 \u2212 2k2)(\u2212i1 \u2212 2k1,\u2212i2 \u2212 2k2)] .\n(28)\nSince n2, k2 = 0, 1 (mod 2), the condition i2 = \u2212i2+n2\u2212 2k2 (mod 2) is equivalent to 2i2 = n2\n(mod 2), thus only Z2-untwisted sectors (i.e. n2 = 0) with k2 = arbitrary contribute to the\namplitude. The condition i1 = \u2212i1 + n1 \u2212 2k1 (mod 4) implies e.g. for the brane with i1 = 0\nthat the sectors n1 = 0 with k1 = 0, 2 and n1 = 2 with k1 = 1, 3 contribute to the amplitude. To\nsummarize, for (i1, i2) = (0, 0) the sectors (n1, k1)(n2, k2) = (0, 0)(0, 0), (0, 0)(0, 1), (0, 2)(0, 0),\n(0, 2)(0, 1), (2, 1)(0, 0), (2, 1)(0, 1), (2, 3)(0, 0) and (2, 3)(0, 1) contribute. The other branes of\nthe arrangement in figure 3 get contributions from different sectors, but the resulting amplitude\nis the same, therefore we can restrict the calculation to the case (i1, i2) = (0, 0) and insert factors\nof 8 appropriately, again.\nNow the representation matrices of the orientifold group have to be taken into account. For\nthe brane (i1, i2) in the sector (n1, k1)(n2, k2) they appear as\ntr\n[\n\u03b3\n(i1\u2212n1,i2\u2212n2)\u2212T\n\u2126Rk1k2\n\u03b3\n(i1,i2)\n\u2126Rk1k2\n]\n. (29)\nSince only untwisted and \u039821-twisted sectors appear, we abbreviate a\n(n1)\nk1k2\n\u2261 tr\n[\n\u03b3\n(n1,0)\u2212T\n\u2126Rk1k2\n\u03b3\n(0,0)\n\u2126Rk1k2\n]\n.\nThe multiplicities \u03c7M can be obtained in the same way as in the case of the annulus, because\nall intersection points are invariant under \u2126R. We get \u03c7M = 2 in the \u039821-twisted sectors and\n\u03c7M = 1 in the other sectors.\nThis leads to the Mo\u00a8bius strip 1-loop amplitude for the ABA-lattice\nM = \u2212c\n4\n(1RR \u2212 1NSNS)\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndt\nt3\n\u00d7(\na\n(0)\n00 L[1, 4]L[2, 2]2M(0,0)(0,0) + a(0)01 L[2, 2]M(0,0)(0,1)\n+ 2a\n(2)\n10 L[2, 2]M(2,1)(0,0) + 2a(2)11M(2,1)(0,1) + a(0)20 L[2, 2]M(0,2)(0,0)\n+ a\n(0)\n21 L[1, 4]M(0,2)(0,1) + 2a(2)30 L[2, 2]M(2,3)(0,0) + 2a(2)31M(2,3)(0,1)\n)\n.\n(30)\nFor the ABB-lattice, one L[2, 2] in each term of equation (30) with a(n1)k1k2 = a\n(n1)\nk10\nhas to be\nexchanged for L[1, 4].\nPerforming the transformation to the tree-channel t = 1\n8l\n(see appendix A) yields\nM\u02dc = \u22124c (1RR \u2212 1NSNS)\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ndl \u00d7(\na\n(0)\n00 L\u02dc[8, 2]L\u02dc[4, 4]2M\u02dc(0,0) \u2212 2a(2)30 L\u02dc[4, 4]M\u02dc(1,0)\n+ 4a\n(0)\n20 L\u02dc[4, 4]M\u02dc(2,0) \u2212 2a(2)10 L\u02dc[4, 4]M\u02dc(3,0) + 4a(0)01 L\u02dc[4, 4]M\u02dc(0,1)\n+ 4a\n(2)\n31 M\u02dc(1,1) + 4a(0)21 L\u02dc[8, 2]M\u02dc(2,1) + 4a(2)11 M\u02dc(3,1)\n)\n.\n(31)\n11\nFor the ABB-lattice, one L[4, 4] in each term of equation (31) with a(n1)k1k2 = a\n(n1)\nk10\nhas to be\nexchanged for L[8, 2].\nTo obtain the complete projector and to cancel the untwisted tadpoles from the other\ndiagrams, the \u03b3-matrices have to fulfill the conditions\na\n(0)\n00 = a\n(2)\n10 = \u2212a(0)20 = a(2)30 = \u2212a(0)01 = \u2212a(2)11 = \u2212a(0)21 = a(2)31 = M (32)\nand the untwisted tadpole cancellation condition reads\nABA: [M \u2212 16]2 = 0 ,\nABB: [M \u2212 8]2 = 0 , (33)\nwhich fixes the number of arrangements shown in figure 3 to be 16(8) for the ABA (ABB)\nlattice, respectively.

To summarize, the untwisted massless closed string spectrum contains\nthe N = 1 supergravity multiplet in D = 4 and 4C, where C denotes the chiral multiplet.\nIn the \u0398n11 \u0398\nn2\n2 -twisted sectors the masses are given by\n\u03b1\u2032\n4\nm2L,R = NL,R +\n1\n2\nq2L,R + Evac \u2212\n1\n2\n, (35)\nwith\nqL,R =\n{\n(0,\u00b1(n1~v + n2 ~w)) (NS)(\n1\n2\n, 1\n2\n\u00b1 (n1~v + n2 ~w)\n)\n(R)\n(36)\n12\nand\nEvac =\n1\n2\n\u2211\ni=1,2,3\n|n1vi + n2wi|(1\u2212 |n1vi + n2wi|) , (37)\nwhere one has to take care of 0 \u2264 |n1vi+n2wi| < 1. We discuss the \u039821-twisted sector explicitly,\nthe other sectors are obtained in a similar manner.\nIn the \u039821-twisted NSNS sector, the massless states which fulfill the GSO-projection (9) are\nfound to be\n|0, 1\n2\n, 1\n2\n, 0\u3009L \u2261 |1\u3009NS , |0,\u221212 ,\u221212 , 0\u3009L \u2261 |2\u3009NS ,\n|0,\u22121\n2\n,\u22121\n2\n, 0\u3009R \u2261 |1\u02dc\u3009NS , |0, 12 , 12 , 0\u3009R \u2261 |2\u02dc\u3009NS ,\nsuch that we get the two massless ground states |11\u02dc\u3009NSNS and |22\u02dc\u3009NSNS. The other two possible\ncombinations are not invariant under \u03982. Furthermore we have to consider the action of \u2126R,\n\u03981 and \u03982 on the fixed points. Since the torus T3 is untwisted, the discussion is valid for both\nthe ABA and the ABB lattice. For the fixed point structure see figure 2. In the tori T1 and\nT2, the fixed points 3 and 4 are interchanged by \u03981. In addition, the fixed points 3 and 4 in the\ntorus T2 are interchanged by \u2126R. Under the action of \u03982 all the fixed points are invariant. In\nthe following e.g. {13} denotes the fixed point built from fixed points 1 of T1 and 3 of T2. The\nfixed points {11}, {12}, {21} and {22} are invariant under \u2126R and \u03981. The fixed points {31},\n{41} as well as {32}, {42} form pairs under \u03981. The fixed points {13}, {14} as well as {23},\n{24} form pairs under \u03981 and \u2126R. The remaining fixed points {33}, {34}, {43} and {44} form\na quartet under \u03981 and \u2126R. Symmetrization in the NSNS sector leads to two scalars for each\nfixed point, each pair and the quartet, i.e. 18 scalars altogether.\nThe discussion of the \u039821-twisted RR sector is similar, but here the action of \u2126R gives an\nadditional minus sign. Therefore we have to antisymmetrize between left and right movers, such\nthat we get no states from the fixed points and pairs mentioned above. The quartet contributes\none vector (V).\nAdding the superpartners from the NSR sector, we find 9C + 1V in the \u039821-twisted sector.\nThe remaining twisted sectors can be treated in a similar fashion and we obtain the massless\ntwisted closed string spectrum\nABA: 57C + 1V ,\nABB: 47C + 11V .\n(38)\n3.5 The open string spectrum\nIn order to determine the open string spectrum we have to count the degrees of freedom of the\nChan-Paton factors for the massless states. Therefore, we have to find a representation of the\norientifold group which satisfies the tadpole cancellation conditions (25) and (32). In general,\nwe have to consider the action of the orientifold group on massless states of the form |\u03c8, ij\u3009\u03bb(a,b)ji ,\nwhere \u03c8 represents the vacuum together with some combination of oscillators, i, j = 1, . . . ,M\n(M is the number of arrangements of branes) and \u03bb(a,b) is the Chan-Paton matrix for a string\n13\nstarting on brane a and ending on brane b, with a, b = 1, . . . , 8, i.e.4\n(\u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 ) : |\u03c8, ij\u3009\u03bb(a,b)ji \u2212\u2192 |\u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 \u00b7 \u03c8, ij\u3009\n(\n\u03b3\n(b)\n\u2126Rk1k2\n\u03bb\u03b3\n(a)\u22121\n\u2126Rk1k2\n)T\nji\n. (39)\nTo check whether the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions (25) are satisfied, we need the\nrepresentation matrices of the orbifold group which can be obtained via e.g.\n(\u2126R\u0398k1\u221211 \u0398k22 )(\u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 ) : |\u03c8, ij\u3009\u03bb(a,b)ji = \u03981 : |\u03c8, ij\u3009\u03bb(a,b)ji (40)\nwhich implies \u03b3\n(a)\n1 \u2243 \u03b3(b)\u2212T\u2126Rk1\u22121,k2\u03b3\n(a)\n\u2126Rk1k2\n, where \u201c\u2243\u201d means equal up to an irrelevant phase.\nTaking into account all these constraints, we find the \u03b3-matrices listed in appendix C. They\nform a projective representation of the orientifold group 5, where the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 substructure is\nsimilar to the model discussed in[11], which in turn is T-dual to the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2126R-orientifold\ndiscussed in section 4.\nIn the untwisted NS sector (i.e. strings which start and end on the same brane) the massless\nstates are given by \u03c8m\u22121\/2|0, ij\u3009\u03bb(a,a)ji (m = 0, . . . , 9). The string (1, 1) is invariant under \u2126R,\n\u2126R\u039821, \u2126R\u03982, and \u2126R\u039821\u03982, where the last symmetry is not independent of the first three.\nApplying equation (39), we get the following constraints on the Chan-Paton matrix \u03bb(1,1) in\nthe noncompact directions \u00b5 = 0, . . . , 3\n\u03bb(1,1) = \u2212\n(\n\u03b3\n(1)\n\u2126R00\u03bb\n(1,1)\u03b3\n(1)\u22121\n\u2126R00\n)T\n= \u2212\n(\n\u03b3\n(1)\n\u2126R20\u03bb\n(1,1)\u03b3\n(1)\u22121\n\u2126R20\n)T\n= \u2212\n(\n\u03b3\n(1)\n\u2126R01\u03bb\n(1,1)\u03b3\n(1)\u22121\n\u2126R01\n)T\n, (41)\nwhere the minus signs arise from the action of \u2126R on the massless state. Using the \u03b3-matrices\nlisted in appendix C this leads to\n\u03bb(1,1) = \u2212\u03bb(1,1)T = M1\u03bb(1,1)TM1 = M2\u03bb(1,1)TM2 . (42)\nCounting the remaining degrees of freedom of \u03bb(1,1) we find that \u03c8\u00b5\u22121\/2|0, ij\u3009\u03bb(1,1)ji is a vector\nin the adjoint representation of the gauge group Sp(M\n4\n). In a similar manner the compact\ndirections \u03c8i,\u00afi\u22121\/2|0, kl\u3009\u03bb(1,1)lk , (i = 1, 2, 3; i\u00af = 1\u00af, 2\u00af, 3\u00af) yield 3C in the antisymmetric representation\nof Sp(M\n4\n).\nFor the (2, 2)-string, the symmetries are \u2126R\u03981, \u2126R\u039831 and \u2126R\u03981\u03982. Inserting the cor-\nresponding \u03b3-matrices also leads to equation (42) for \u03bb(2,2), i.e. the same result as for the\n(1, 1)-string, but now the gauge group Sp(M\n4\n) constitutes a second factor of a product gauge\ngroup, since the strings are not mapped onto each other by any symmetry of the theory.\nThe invariances of the (3, 3)-string are the same as for the (1, 1)-string and lead to the same\ndegrees of freedom. But since the (1, 1)-string is mapped onto the (3, 3)-string by a symmetry\nof the theory, namely \u03981, the (3, 3)-string is charged under the same factor of the gauge group\nand does not contribute any further matter. Furthermore, we have to check that the additional\nidentities \u03bb(3,3) = \u03b1\u03b3\n(1)\n1 \u03bb\n(1,1)\u03b3\n(1)\u22121\n1 (\u03b1 = 1 in the directions 0, . . . , 3, \u03b1 = i on T1, \u03b1 = \u2212i on T2\n4For notational simplicity in the following we label the eight branes in the arrangement shown in figure 3\nwith single numbers as given in table 82 of appendix C.\n5For a summary on projective representations and further references see the appendix of [22].\n14\nand \u03b1 = 1 on T3) are consistent with the degrees of freedom found so far, which is the case,\nindeed.\nProceeding in a similar manner for the strings (4, 4), . . . (8, 8) we find that the untwisted\nopen string spectrum contains 1V in the adjoint of the gauge group\n[\nSp(M\n4\n)\n]4\nand 3C in\nthe [(A, 1, 1, 1) \u2295 (1, A, 1, 1) \u2295 (1, 1, A, 1) \u2295 (1, 1, 1, A)], where A denotes the antisymmetric\nrepresentation of Sp(M\n4\n) and the four factors of the gauge group arise from the strings (1, 1),\n(2, 2), (5, 5) and (6, 6), respectively. The strings (3, 3), (4, 4), (7, 7) and (8, 8) are related to\nthese strings by the symmetry \u03981 and do not contribute any further degrees of freedom, as\nexplained above.\nWe begin the discussion of the open string twisted sectors with the (1, 2)-string. In the sense\nof the explanation in the beginning of section 3.2, this string forms the \u039831-twisted sector and\nthe massless states are given by \u03c81\u22121\/4|013, ij\u3009\u03bb(1,2)ji and \u03c82\u00af\u22121\/4|013 , ij\u3009\u03bb(1,2)ji , where 013 denotes\nthe \u039831-twisted NS vacuum. The (1, 2)-string is invariant under \u0398\n2\n1 and \u03982. This leads to the\nconstraints on the Chan-Paton factors\n\u03bb(1,2) = \u00b1\u03b3(2)20 \u03bb(1,2)\u03b3(1)\u2212120 = \u00b1\u03b3(2)01 \u03bb(1,2)\u03b3(1)\u2212101 , (43)\nwhere the signs are unphysical, since we only know that \u039841 and \u0398\n2\n2 act trivially on the (1, 2)-\nstring and inserting the corresponding \u03b3-matrices yields\n\u03bb(1,2) = \u00b1M1\u03bb(1,2)M1 = \u00b1M2\u03bb(1,2)M2 (44)\nwhere the signs are unphysical and thus arbitrary. Calculating the degrees of freedom we obtain\nthat the (1, 2)-string transforms in the bifundamental (F, F, 1, 1) of the gauge group. The strings\n(2, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 1) are related to the (1, 2)-string by the symmetries \u2126R and \u03981. Since the\nmassless state is twofold degenerated, these strings form 2 scalars in the (F, F, 1, 1). Analogous\nthe strings (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8) and (8, 5) form 2 scalars in the (1, 1, F, F ). The \u03981-twisted sector\nis equivalent to the \u039831-twisted sector, which contains the strings (1, 4), (2, 1) etc. Therefore\nthese sectors together yield 2C in the (F, F, 1, 1)\u2295(1, 1, F, F ). Since only Z4-twisted intersection\npoints appear, the multiplicity is one.\nThe (1, 3)-string, i.e. the \u039821-twisted sector, possesses the additional symmetries \u2126R\u03981 and\n\u2126R\u039831, which lead to the constraints\n\u03bb(1,3) = \u2212\n(\n\u03b3\n(3)\n\u2126R10\u03bb\n(1,3)\u03b3\n(1)\u22121\n\u2126R10\n)T\n= \u2212\n(\n\u03b3\n(3)\n\u2126R30\u03bb\n(1,3)\u03b3\n(1)\u22121\n\u2126R30\n)T\n, (45)\nwhere the minus signs again arise from the action of \u2126R on the massless states. Inserting the\ncorresponding \u03b3-matrices yields\n\u03bb(1,3) = \u2212AT\u03bb(1,3)TA = BT\u03bb(1,3)TB . (46)\nCounting the degrees of freedom, we find that the (1, 3)-string transforms in the (A, 1, 1, 1),\nwhere A denotes the antisymmetric representation of Sp(M\n4\n). The (1, 3)-string is related to\nthe (3, 1)-string by \u03981, just as (2, 4) to (4, 2), (5, 7) to (7, 5) and (6, 8) to (8, 6). The massless\nstates are twofold degenerated and since T1 and T2 are Z2-twisted, the multiplicity is 2 in\nboth the ABA- and the ABB-lattice. Thus the \u039821-twisted sector contributes 2C in the\n[(A, 1, 1, 1)\u2295 (1, A, 1, 1)\u2295 (1, 1, A, 1)\u2295 (1, 1, 1, A)] for both lattices.\n15\nThe (1, 5)-string, i.e. the \u03982-twisted sector, is invariant under \u0398\n2\n1 and \u03982. Again imposing\nthat the square of these symmetries act trivially on the massless states, we get the constraints\n\u03bb(1,5) = \u00b1iN2\u03bb(1,5)M1 = \u00b1M1\u03bb(1,3)TM2 . (47)\nThis implies that the strings (1, 5), (5, 1), (3, 7) and (7, 3), which are related by \u2126R and \u03981,\ntransform in the (F, 1, F, 1). Analogous the strings (2, 6), (6, 2), (4, 8) and (8, 4) transform\nin the (1, F, 1, F ). The massless states are twofold degenerated. Now the tori T2 and T3 are\nZ2-twisted, thus the multiplicity is 2 in the ABA-lattice and 4 in the ABB-lattice. Altogether\nthe \u03982-twisted sector contributes 2C (4C) in the (F, 1, F, 1)\u2295 (1, F, 1, F ) for the ABA (ABB)\nlattice.\nProceeding in a similar manner for the remaining twisted sectors we obtain the open string\ntwisted massless spectrum shown in table 3. The only pecularity is the fact that the \u03981\u03982-\ntwisted sector (and the sector twisted by \u039831\u03982) has only one massless ground state.\ntwist-sector ABA ABB gauge group \/ matter\nuntwisted 1V\n3C\n[Sp(M\n4\n)]4\n(A, 1, 1, 1)\u2295 (1, A, 1, 1)\n\u2295(1, 1, A, 1)\u2295 (1, 1, 1, A)\n\u03981 +\u0398\n3\n1 2C (F, F, 1, 1)\u2295 (1, 1, F, F )\n\u039821 2C (A, 1, 1, 1)\u2295 (1, A, 1, 1)\n\u2295(1, 1, A, 1)\u2295 (1, 1, 1, A)\n\u03982 2C 4C (F, 1, F, 1)\u2295 (1, F, 1, F )\n\u03981\u03982 +\u0398\n3\n1\u03982 1C 2C (F, 1, 1, F )\u2295 (1, F, F, 1)\n\u039821\u03982 1C 2C (F, 1, F, 1)\u2295 (1, F, 1, F )\nTable 3: Open string massless spectrum of Z4 \u00d7 Z2.\n4 The Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2126R\u2013Orientifold\nSince the orbifold group Z2\u00d7Z2 is contained as a substructure in the Z4\u00d7Z2 model discussed\nabove, the calculation is similar and we do not have to go into the details again.\nThe lattice is described by the shifts ~v = (1\/2,\u22121\/2, 0) for the first Z2-factor and ~w =\n(0, 1\/2,\u22121\/2) for the second one and shown in figure 2. The A- and B-lattice are not inter-\nchanged by any insertion from the orientifold group, thus we obtain perturbatively consistent\nand inequivalent solutions for the lattices AAA, AAB, ABB and BBB. The arrangement of\nrotated D-6-branes we have to introduce is shown in figure 5.

Inserting n = 0, 1\nyields the four branes (i1, i2) = (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1) mod (2, 2).\nPerforming the calculation of the amplitudes, we obtain the untwisted sector tadpole can-\ncellation conditions\nAAA: [M \u2212 32]2 = 0 ,\nAAB: [M \u2212 16]2 = 0 ,\nABB: [M \u2212 8]2 = 0 ,\nBBB: [M \u2212 4]2 = 0 ,\n(48)\nwhich fix the number M of arrangements of branes shown in figure 5. The remaining tadpole\ncancellation conditions yield the representation matrices of the orientifold group, which can be\nread off from the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 substructure of tables (82) and (83) in appendix C. Using these\nmatrices, we again solve the constraints arising from the symmetries of the various strings and\nobtain the massless open string spectrum shown in table (73) in appendix B. The massless\nclosed string spectrum is shown in table (72) in appendix B.\nConsidering the spectrum we can explicitly verify that for the AAA lattice the Z2 \u00d7 Z2\n\u2126R-orientifold is T-dual to the model discussed in[11]. Applying T-duality in the directions of\nthe imaginary axes of the compact dimensions transforms \u2126R to \u2126 and the four D-6-branes in\nfigure 5 into one D-9-brane and three types of D-5-branes. The AAB,ABB and BBB models\nare T-dual to the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 orientifolds with discrete B field of rank 2,4 and 6, respectively,\nlisted in [23]. To our knowledge, orientifolds with discrete B field have been discussed first\nin [24]. For max(N,M) > 2 the T-duals are asymmetric orientifolds with nonzero B field[25].\nInterestingly, for heterotic theories, which are believed to be connected to open string theories,\nsimilar observations have been made in[26, 27].\n5 The Z6 \u00d7 Z3 \u2126R\u2013Orientifold\nThe lattice for this model is generated by the shifts ~v = (1\/6,\u22121\/6, 0) and ~w = (0, 1\/3,\u22121\/3)\nand shown in figure 6. TheA- andB-lattice are interchanged by \u2126R\u03981, thus we get solutions for\nthe lattices ABA and ABB. To cancel the tadpoles from the closed string we have to introduce\nthe arrangement of 18 rotated branes shown in figure 7 and the number M of arrangements is\nfixed by the untwisted tapole cancellation condition\n[M \u2212 4]2 = 0 , (49)\n17\n1A B\n1\n2\n3\n4\n56 6\n4\n5\n2 3\nFigure 6: Lattices for Z6 \u00d7 Z3.

Inserting\nn = 0, . . . , 5 and m = 0, 1, 2 yields 18 branes.\nwhich we obtain for both the lattices ABA and ABB. Since this model contains less Z2\nsubstructure than the two models discussed above, we expect the projective representation\nof the orientifold group to be less complicated. In fact it turns out that we get by with the\n\u03b3-matrices of[8], taking into account the relative signs arising from the tadpole cancellation\nconditions. Calculating the massless open string spectrum shown in table (75) in appendix B\nwe have to take care of the fact that some of the intersection points are not invariant under\nvarious insertions. The massless closed string spectrum is shown in table (74) in appendix B.\n6 The Z3 \u00d7 Z3 \u2126R\u2013Orientifold\nThe orbifold shifts are now given by ~v = (1\/3,\u22121\/3, 0) and ~w = (0, 1\/3,\u22121\/3). The lattice is\nthe same as shown in figure 6, discarding the additional Z2 fixed points. The choices AAA,\nAAB, ABB and BBB lead to perturbatively consistent solutions. All these four models yield\nthe untwisted tadpole cancellation condition displayed in equation (49). The calculation of the\nmassless open string spectrum is particularly simple in this case, because the orbifold group\ncontains no Z2-substructure. Therefore we can choose the \u03b3-matrices to be the identity-matrix\n(up to a phase), while the relative signs are again fixed by the tadpole cancellation conditions.\nAltogether we obtain the massless spectrum shown in the tables (76) and (77) in appendix B.\n18\n7 Conclusions\nIn this paper we presented a class of orientifolds of type IIA string theory with orbifold group\nZN \u00d7 ZM . In addition, symmetry under worldsheet parity \u2126 combined with the reflection R\nof three directions was imposed. Further, we considered only cases leading to unbroken N = 1\nsupersymmetry in the four non compact directions. We found that (N,M) = (4, 2), (2, 2), (6, 3)\nand (3, 3) are the only perturbatively consistent solutions. For these models we gave the so-\nlutions to the tadpole cancellation conditions and the massless spectra. In addition to the\nuniversal supergravity fields there are various gauge and matter fields living on D-branes inter-\nsecting at angles. The smallest intersection angle is given by \u03c0\/max (N,M). Explicit results\nare presented only for the cases where the gauge groups are maximal, i.e. all the D-branes sit\nat the corresponding orientifold fixed planes. These gauge groups can be Higgsed to smaller\ngroups by moving certain numbers of D-branes off the O-planes.\nThe type IIA orientifolds considered here can be dualized to type IIB orientifolds by per-\nforming T-duality in the directions where R acts in a non-trivial way. As stated in the end\nof section 4 the resulting type IIB orientifolds have in most cases a non-trivial discrete B field\nbackground. (With B we denote the NSNS antisymmetric tensor.) Constant B field back-\ngrounds have received some attention in the recent past because they can lead to a microscopic\ndescription of non-commutative field theories[28\u201331]. In this context it may be also interesting\nwhether the IIA orientifolds considered here can be modified to include non trivial B field\nbackgrounds. In order to study this question one should investigate whether the tadpole can-\ncellation conditions can be solved by projective representations of the orientifold group which\nare not equivalent to the ones given here[32, 33]. Note that Bij is quantized only if R acts\nwith the same sign on xi and xj . Otherwise Bij is a modulus and instead Gij (the off-diagonal\ncomponent of the metric) is quantized[34].\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported by TMR programs ERBFMRX\u2013CT96\u20130045 and CT96\u20130090.\nWe acknowledge discussions with Ralph Blumenhagen, Jan Conrad, Boris Ko\u00a8rs and Hans Peter\nNilles.\n19\nA Computation of one-loop diagrams\nIn this appendix we will give the details of the computation of the diagrams fig. 1 in the loop\nchannel, i.e. evaluate the expressions (10), (11), and (12).

The letters K(\u00b7)(\u00b7), M(\u00b7)(\u00b7) and A(\u00b7)(\u00b7) stand for oscillator contributions. The upper\nquadruple index describes the twist sector and the insertion of a ZN \u00d7 ZM element as follows:\nthe contribution corresponds to the \u0398n11 \u0398\nn2\n2 twisted sector with a \u0398\nk1\n1 \u0398\nk2\n2 insertion in the trace.\n(For simplicity, open strings ending on different types of D-branes are called twisted as stated\nin the text.) The \u03b3\u2019s are the matrix representations of the orientifold group as in [8]. The lower\nindex stands for the corresponding group element, e.g. \u2126Rk1k2 corresponds to \u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 . The\nupper double index (i1, i2) labels the different types of D-6-branes as described in the text.\nFinally, L stands for the lattice contribution (i.e. sums over discrete momenta and windings).\nThe indexing is like in the oscillator contributions given above.\nA.1 Lattice contributions\nThe explicit expressions for the lattice contributions are\nL(n1,k1)(n2,k2)K = \u03c7(n1,k1)(n2,k2)K Tr(n1,n2)KK+W\n(\n\u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 e\u22122\u03c0t(L0+L\u00af0)\n)\n, (53)\nL(n1,k1)(n2,k2)(i1,i2)M = \u03c7(n1,k1)(n2,k2)(i1,i2)M Tr(i1,i2),(i1\u2212n1,i2\u2212n2)KK+W\n(\n\u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 e\u22122\u03c0tL0\n)\n, (54)\nL(n1,k1)(n2,k2)(i1,i2)A = \u03c7(n1,k1)(n2,k2)(i1,i2)A Tr(i1,i2),(i1\u2212n1,i2\u2212n2)KK+W\n(\n\u0398k11 \u0398\nk2\n2 e\n\u22122\u03c0tL0\n)\n. (55)\nIn the Klein bottle \u03c7 is the number of the corresponding fixed points6 whereas in the open string\namplitudes \u03c7 is the intersection number of the branes involved. (The indexing is analogous to\nthe one described above.) The upper index at Traces gives the twist sector. Sums over windings\n6In more detail: It is the number of \u0398n1\n1\n\u0398n2\n2\nfixed points which are left invariant under R\u0398k1\n1\n\u0398k2\n2\n.\n20\nand momenta lead to expressions of the form\nL [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2261\n(\u2211\nm\u2208Z\ne\u2212\u03b1\u03c0tm\n2\/\u03c1\n)(\u2211\nn\u2208Z\ne\u2212\u03b2\u03c0tn\n2\u03c1\n)\n, (56)\nwhere \u03c1 = r2\/\u03b1\u2032. In the tree channel the corresponding function is defined as\nL\u02dc [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2261\n(\u2211\nm\u2208Z\ne\u2212\u03b1\u03c0lm\n2\u03c1\n)(\u2211\nn\u2208Z\ne\u2212\u03b2\u03c0ln\n2\/\u03c1\n)\n. (57)\nThe transformation from the loop channel to the tree channel is performed by Poisson resum-\nmation, \u2211\nn\u2208Z\ne\u2212\u03c0n\n2\/t =\n\u221a\nt\n\u2211\nn\u2208Z\ne\u2212\u03c0n\n2t. (58)\nThe exact form of lattice contributions depends on the model and the results are given in the\ntext.\nA.2 Oscillator contributions\nThe general expressions for the oscillator contributions are\nK(n1,k1)(n2,k2) = Tr(n1,n2)NSNS\n(\n\u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 (\u22121)F e\u22122\u03c0t(L0+L\u00af0)\n)\n, (59)\nM(n1,k1)(n2,k2) = Tr(0,0)(\u2212n1,\u2212n2)R\n(\n\u2126R\u0398k11 \u0398k22 e\u22122\u03c0tL0\n)\n, (60)\nA(n1,k1)(n2,k2) = Tr(0,0)(\u2212n1,\u2212n2)NS\n(\n\u0398k11 \u0398\nk2\n2 (\u22121)F e\u22122\u03c0tL0\n)\n. (61)\nBecause of the \u2126R insertion in the Klein bottle partition function the expression (59) is actually\nindependent of k1, k2 and we define\nK(n1,n2) \u2261 K(n1,k1)(n2,k2). (62)\nThe upper index at the open string amplitudes indicates the boundary conditions, i.e. the\ncomputation is done for a string stretching between brane (0, 0) and (\u2212n1,\u2212n2). Equivalently,\none could trace over open strings stretching between branes (i1, i2) and (i1 \u2212 n1, i2 \u2212 n2).\nThe oscillator contributions can be expressed in terms of Jacobi theta functions and the\nDedekind eta function,\n\u03d1\n[\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n]\n(t) =\n\u2211\nn\u2208Z\nq\n(n+\u03b1)2\n2 e2\u03c0i(n+\u03b1)\u03b2, (63)\n\u03b7 (t) = q\n1\n24\n\u221e\u220f\nn=1\n(1\u2212 qn) , (64)\n21\nwith q = e\u22122\u03c0t.

(67)\nThe arguments in the theta and eta functions are 2t in the Klein bottle, t + i\n2\nin the Mo\u00a8bius\nstrip, and t in the annulus. Further, we used the notation[20],\n\u3008x\u3009 \u2261 x\u2212 [x]\u2212 1\n2\n, (68)\nwhere the brackets on the rhs denote the integer part and\n\u03b4 =\n{\n1 if (n1vi + n2wi, k1vi + k2wi) \u2208 Z\u00d7 Z + 12\n0 else\n(69)\nThe tree channel expressions K\u02dc(\u00b7), M\u02dc (\u00b7) and A\u02dc(\u00b7) can be evaluated with the help of the modular\ntransformation properties,\n\u03d1\n[\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n]\n(1\/t) =\n\u221a\nte2\u03c0i\u03b1\u03b2\u03d1\n[ \u2212\u03b2\n\u03b1\n]\n(t) , (70)\n\u03b7 (1\/t) =\n\u221a\nt\u03b7 (t) . (71)\n22\nAs usual, there is a subtlety in the Mo\u00a8bius strip. Before performing the modular transformation\none writes the theta functions with complex arguments as a product of theta functions with\nreal arguments[8]. Since the calculation is a straightforward modification of the one presented\nin the appendix of[20] and the formulas are rather lengthy, we do not give the explicit tree\nchannel expressions here.\nB Tables of massless spectra\nIn this appendix we collect tables giving the massless spectra of Z2 \u00d7Z2, Z6 \u00d7Z3 and Z3 \u00d7 Z3\n\u2126R-orientifolds.
