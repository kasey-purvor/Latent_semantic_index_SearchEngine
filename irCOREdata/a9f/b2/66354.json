In essence, the cross-passage\npressure gradient set up by the mainstream \u008f ow sweeps\nthe low momentum boundary \u008f uid from pressure to\nsuction surface on the end wall, with a compensating\ncounter\u008f ow at a distance from the wall. Other phenom-\nena are associated with secondary \u008f ow, which has been\nstudied extensively and of which a comprehensive review\nwas made by Sieverding [1]. The secondary \u008f ow gives\nrise to increased loss within the blade row and produces a\nnon-uniform \u008f ow at exit which may cause extra loss in\nsucceeding blade rows.\nIn a low aspect ratio highly loaded turbine, the effects\nof secondary \u008f ow are evident throughout most of the \u008f ow\n\u008e eld, and the secondary loss may account for about half\nof the total loss. A widely used method of reducing\nsecondary \u008f ows is to use non-radial stacking or blade\nlean which aims to unload the blade end, thus reducing\nthe cross-passage pressure difference there, as described\nby Harrison [2]. Pro\u008e ling of the end wall(s) of a blade\nrow also holds promise for reducing secondary \u008f ow\nthrough the reduction of the cross-passage pressure\ndifference at the end wall. This could be used in addition\nto blade lean or where blade lean is not desirable, as in a\nstressed rotor blade. A number of workers have tried\nvarious pro\u008e les, for instance Deich et al. [3] and Morris\nand Hoare [4] in linear cascades and Ewen et al. [5] and\nBoletis [6] in rotating rigs. Generally some improvements\nhave been reported, but the results are rather variable.\nWith the advent of computational \u008f uid dynamics (CFD)\nsome workers have used a more systematic approach\nusing CFD to help to design pro\u008e les, for instance Atkins\n[7] and Rose [8]. Rose used a CFD method to design a\nnon-axisymmetric end wall pro\u008e le to reduce the non-\nuniformity of static pressure distribution at the platform\nedge downstream of the trailing edge of nozzle guide\nvanes. The object was to reduce the cooling air \u008f ow\nrequirements to avoid hot gas ingestion. Hartland et al.\n[9] used Rose\u2019s idea to design a non-axisymmetric\nA03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A\n721\nThis paper was presented at the 4th European Conference on\n\u2018Turbomachinery \u2019 held in Firenze, Italy on 20\u201323 March 2001.

The pro\u008e le had convex curvature on\nthe end wall near the pressure surface, reducing the\npressure there, and concave curvature near the suction\nsurface, raising the pressure there. Thus the cross-passage\npressure gradient was reduced, reducing the secondary\n\u008f ow. This principle was also used by Yan et al. [10] to\nreduce the secondary \u008f ows in a nozzle row of a steam\nturbine.\nHarvey et al. [11] described an inverse design method\nfor end wall pro\u008e les to reduce secondary \u008f ow. This\nmethod made use of a CFD code based on the method\ndescribed by Moore [12]. The code uses the pressure\ncorrection algorithm and a mixing length type turbulence\nmodel with wall functions. A computation uses typically\n100 000 grid points for the half-span. This modest\nnumber of points is adequate for this application without\nthe need for a low Reynolds number turbulence model.\nThe computation of the secondary \u008f ow is expected to be\ngood, although the loss prediction less accurate. Hartland\net al. [13] tested in a linear cascade a pro\u008e le designed by\nthe method to provide experimental veri\u008e cation. The\npro\u008e le (known as P1) tested by Hartland et al. extended\nsome distance upstream and downstream of the blade\nrow, and so was not suitable for application to a real\nmachine. The object of the work reported in this paper\nwas to use the inverse design method to produce a second\npro\u008e le (known as P2) restricted to the blade passage. The\naxial restriction could result in a more \u2018extreme\u2019 pro\u008e le\nwith sharper differences in curvature. Thus it was im-\nportant to provide an experimental test for such a pro\u008e le.\nIt should be mentioned that the inverse design method\nwas based on reducing the secondary \u008f ow, as this is\nlikely to be more reliably predicted than loss by the CFD\nmethod. Thus it is important to carry out experimental\ninvestigations to ascertain the extent to which reductions\nin secondary \u008f ow result in reductions in loss.\n2 EXPERIMENTS\n2.1 Durham cascade\nThe cascade contains rotor blades with an inlet angle\n(from axial) of 42.75\u00b0 and an exit angle of \u00a168.7\u00b0; these\nare similar to those of a high pressure axial \u008f ow turbine.\nThe axial chord is 181 mm and the half-span 200 mm.\nThe \u008f ow is low Mach number and upstream there is a\ngrid of bars to raise the inlet turbulence intensity to \u00b95\nper cent. The cascade geometry is described in detail by\nGregory-Smith and Cleak [14].\nThe instrumentation included end wall static pressure\ntappings in order to determine the effect of the pro\u008e le on\nthe pressure distribution which drives the secondary \u008f ow.\nThere are slots in one end wall through which probes can\nbe inserted to measure the \u008f ow in the opposite half-span.\nFive-hole pressure probes were used to determine the\ninlet \u008f ow and the \u008f ow at exit at a plane 28 per cent axial\nchord downstream (known as slot 10). A full description\nof these measurements is given by Jayaraman [15]. In\naddition extensive surface \u008f ow visualization was carried\nout with an oil and dye mixture in order to investigate the\n\u008f ow on the end wall and suction surface.\n2.2 End wall pro\u008e le design\nThe design of pro\u008e le P2 was carried out using the inverse\nmethod described by Harvey et al. [11], although it has\nbeen somewhat developed since that paper was pub-\nlished. As mentioned above, the pro\u008e ling of P2 was re-\nstricted to the blade passage region, unlike P1. A further\ndifference was that P1 had a ridge extending downstream\nwhich enhanced the countervortex, since the design\nintent had been to reduce the overturning (see Hartland et\nal. [13]). As this vortex will result in increased mixing\nloss, this ridge was eliminated. The manufacture of the\nend wall and the insertion of the static pressure tappings\nare described by Jayaraman [15].\nFigure 1 shows a photograph of the end wall pro\u008e le P1\nand Fig. 2 shows P2, both taken from upstream. For both\nP1 and P2, the convex curvature near the pressure surface\n(to reduce static pressure) can be seen as can also the\nconcave curvature near the suction surface (to raise the\npressure). P1 shows the pro\u008e ling extending some\ndistance upstream in the form of a ridge from near the\npressure surface. Further details of P1 are given by\nHarvey et al. [11]. However, for P2, the restriction in the\naxial extent of the pro\u008e le results in a high concave\ncurvature near the pressure side of the leading edge.\n3 RESULTS\n3.1 End wall static pressures\nFigure 3 shows the contours of static pressure coef\u008e cient\n(referenced to inlet conditions) for the planar end wall,\npro\u008e le P1 (taken from reference [13]) and pro\u008e le P2. It\nmay be appear that the periodicity is not perfect, but this\nis an artefact of the contour plotting program. Hartland et\nal. [13] indicate a reasonable degree of periodicity. The\neffect of the pro\u008e ling may be seen if, for instance, the\n\u00a11.0 contour is followed. For the three end walls it leaves\nthe pressure side at about \u00a130 mm axial position. For the\nplanar wall it goes across the plotting area, leaving it at\nthe 195 mm circumferential position, and coming back at\n165 mm to meet the suction surface just downstream of\nthe leading edge. However, for pro\u008e le P1 the contour\ncurves round and meets the suction surface much further\ndownstream, at about \u00a1150 mm axial position. For P2 the\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A A03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001\n722 D G GREGORY-SMITH, G INGRAM, P JAYARAMAN, N W HARVEY AND M G ROSE\ncontour goes straight across the end wall to meet the\nsuction surface at \u00a170 mm axial position. Thus near the\nsuction surface, the pressure has been raised signi\u008e cantly.\nThe effects of curvature on the static pressure magnitude\nare much greater near the suction surface because the\nvelocity is higher there.\nIt may be noted that the planar end wall and P1 show\nsome similarity in the static pressure distributions but\nP2 does not. Notable differences in the features are as\nfollows:\n1. P2 is seen to reduce the cross-passage pressure\ngradient the most. For instance at an axial position of\n\u00a1120 mm the change in static pressure coef\u008e cient (PS\n\u2013SS) is as follows: planar, DCPS\u00ba 2.5; P1, DCPS\u00ba\n1.8; P2, DCPS\u00ba 1.0.\n2. The peak pressure for P2 is not on the pressure surface\non the blade but some 20 mm away from it in the\ncircumferential direction.\n3. With P2 there is a trough in static pressure located at\nsome distance from the suction surface, unlike the\nplanar end wall and P1.\n4. For P2 in the later part of the passage the pressure\ngradient is along the passage; for planar end wall and\nP1 the pressure gradient is inclined towards the suction\nsurface.\n3.2 Traverse results, 28 per cent axial chord\ndownstream\nThe results of the \u008e ve-hole probe traversing at the down-\nstream plane, slot 10, are presented here, again making\nuse of data from Hartland et al. [13]. Figure 4 shows the\nsecondary velocity vectors for the planar, P1 and P2 end\nwalls. Both P1 and P2 show a signi\u008e cant reduction in the\nmain vortex, the clockwise passage vortex. In addition\nP2 shows a small countervortex on the wall (\u00a1300 to\nFig. 1 Pro\u008e le P1\nFig. 2 Pro\u008e le P2\nA03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A\nNON-AXISYMMETRIC TURBINE END WALL PROFILING 723\n\u00a1325 mm), similar to the planar end wall, so that the\nenhanced countervortex caused by the ridge in P1 has\nbeen ameliorated. Figure 5 shows the pitchwise averaged\nsecondary kinetic energy at slot 10. The big reduction in\nthe passage vortex with both pro\u008e les is clear. As well as\nbeing reduced, the vortex is brought closer to the end\nwall. However, the passage vortex strength appears a\nlittle higher for P2 than P1. Nearer the end wall, the\nstrong countervortex with P1 has been considerably\nreduced with P2, although not to quite the level of the\nplanar end wall. Figure 6 shows the variation in yaw\nangle for the three end walls resulting from the secondary\n\u008f ow. With the reduction in passage vortex strength, the\nunder and over turning in the region of the vortex has\nbeen reduced, with P2 showing the least variation. Nearer\nthe end wall, P2 gives rather less overturning, although\nFig. 3 (continued over)\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A A03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001\n724 D G GREGORY-SMITH, G INGRAM, P JAYARAMAN, N W HARVEY AND M G ROSE\nclose to the wall the three end walls give the same over-\nturning value. Also shown in Fig. 7 is the CFD design\nprediction for the yaw angle. At mid-span there is about\n1.5\u00b0 difference, and a similar difference was reported by\nHartland et al. [13] for the planar end wall. Allowing for\nthis, CFD and experiments agree well for the under\nturning peak from 120 to 40 mm from the end wall,\nalthough the slightly lower under turning for the P2\nexperiment is not shown by CFD. Closer than 20 mm to\nthe end wall CFD for P1 shows much less overturning as\na consequence of the strong countervortex. This is not\nshown by the experiments, but the resolution of the\ntraversing is not \u008e ne enough to draw de\u008e nite conclusions.\nThe contours of total pressure loss coef\u008e cient for the\nthree end walls are shown in Fig. 8. The main loss core\nsituated some distance from the end wall is caused by the\naction of the passage vortex sweeping up the inlet\nboundary layer and causing extra loss by interaction with\nFig. 3 End wall static pressure coef\u008e cients for (a) planar, (b) P1 and (c) P2 pro\u008e les\nA03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A\nNON-AXISYMMETRIC TURBINE END WALL PROFILING 725\nthe end wall and suction surface. For P1 and P2 the loss\ncore is reduced in extent although the peak values (\u00b90.9)\nare similar when compared with the planar wall. A major\ndifference between P1 and P2 is the much smaller loss\nassociated with the countervortex in the latter, and this is\nexpected because the countervortex has been reduced\n(Fig. 4). Pitch-averaged loss values are shown in Fig. 9.\nThe main loss core is not reduced as much for P2 as it is\nfor P1 when compared with the planar end wall. How-\never, it is closer to the end wall corresponding to the\nposition of the passage vortex (Figs 4 and 5). Closer to the\nend wall (less than 30 mm) P2 shows the reduction in loss\nfrom the countervortex compared with P1. Figure 10\nshows the CFD predictions for P1 and P2. The levels are\nmuch higher with the mid-span (pro\u008e le) loss being about\ntwice the experimental value. However the prediction for\nP2 does show a larger loss core than for P1, as shown by\nthe experiment. Qualitatively nearer the wall the predic-\ntion for P2 is quite good, but P1 shows a much higher loss\ndue to the countervortex than is shown by the experiment.\n3.3 Mass-averaged values at slot 10\nA further quantitative picture of the effects of the end\nwall pro\u008e ling is obtained by mass averaging the secon-\nFig. 4 (continued over)\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A A03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001\n726 D G GREGORY-SMITH, G INGRAM, P JAYARAMAN, N W HARVEY AND M G ROSE\ndary kinetic energy and the total pressure loss over the\nplane of slot 10. Figure 11 shows the secondary kinetic\nenergy, and it can be seen that overall P2 achieves almost\nas much reduction from the planar end wall as does P1.\nThis agrees with the observations of the previous Figs 3\nand 4.\nThe area-averaged loss values are shown in Fig. 12,\nwhere net values are shown, that is after subtracting the\ninlet loss. Two sets of values are shown; the actual values\nat slot 10 and the values after performing a mixing\ncalculation to give uniform \u008f ow, the mixed-out loss. It\ncan be seen that, in terms of loss, P2 does not perform as\nwell as P1. The actual value is not much reduced from the\nplanar end wall value.

The highly\nskewed new boundary layer on the end wall downstream\nof the pressure side leg of the HSV is \u008f owing strongly\ntoward the suction surface.\nThe \u008f ow visualization on the pro\u008e led end wall P1 is\nshown in Fig. 14 and also in Fig. 1. A number of differ-\nences are apparent. The two legs of the HSV appear to be\nless strong, particularly the pressure side leg, which is\nhardly distinguishable. The countervortex is still strongly\nvisible and this is to be expected as the traverse data show\nthis to be enhanced for P1 owing to the ridge extending\ndownstream. The skewed new boundary layer appears to\nbe \u008f owing less strongly towards the suction surface.\nHowever, the most noticeable feature is a region of\nstagnant \u008f ow situated upstream of the leading edge on its\npressure side. Figure 1 shows this to be located on the\nridge extending upstream.\nThe \u008f ow visualization for the pro\u008e led end wall P2 is\nshown in Fig. 15. The \u008f ow appears to be similar to that\nof P1, apart from the absence of the stagnant region\nupstream of the leading edge. There is no evidence of\nseparation due to the high curvature on the pressure side\nof the leading edge (see Fig. 2), although Jayaraman [15]\nobserved highly \u008f uctuating \u008f ow in that region when\ninvestigating the \u008f ow with tufts of cotton.\nFig. 6 Pitch-averaged yaw angle\nFig. 7 CFD yaw angle predictions\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A A03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001\n728 D G GREGORY-SMITH, G INGRAM, P JAYARAMAN, N W HARVEY AND M G ROSE\n4 DISCUSSION\nCompared with the planar end wall, the end wall pro\u008e les\nP1 and P2 both reduce signi\u008e cantly the secondary \u008f ow, in\nparticular the passage vortex. Comparing P1 and P2, the\nstatic pressure pro\u008e les on the end wall indicate that P2\nhas a lower cross-passage difference, so this might be\nexpected to give a lower cross-\u008f ow on the end wall.\nHowever, neither the traverse results nor the end wall\n\u008f ow visualization indicates much reduction. There is\nslightly less overturning as the end wall is approached for\nP2, although the near-wall values appear similar for P1\nand P2 (Fig. 6). With P2 there is a signi\u008e cant reduction in\nthe countervortex which is seen in the vector plots and the\nloss contours in that region.\nThe surprising result from the P1 end wall \u008f ow\nvisualization is the region of stagnant \u008f ow upstream of\nthe pressure side of the leading edge (Figs 1 and 13). This\nis not seen with the planar end wall (or in other research\nworkers\u2019 studies) and, although a small area was\noccasionally seen with P2 (Fig. 15 does not show it), an\nexplanation was not immediately evident. So the CFD\nresults for P1 were studied, and Fig. 16 shows the end\nwall streak lines. It can be seen that there is a region\nwhere no end wall \u008f ow reaches the position where the\nstagnant region was observed. It appears that the end wall\nFig. 8 (continued over)\nA03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A\nNON-AXISYMMETRIC TURBINE END WALL PROFILING 729\ncontouring upstream of the leading edge has given rise to\nthis large region which is not apparent in the planar or P2\nend walls (which are planar upstream of the leading\nedge). A further point of note is that the HSV is much\nweakened by the presence of the contouring. The rising\nend wall on the pressure side of the leading edge perhaps\nexpands the vortex, thus reducing its intensity.\nAn important result is that, although P1 and P2 have in\ngeneral a very similar reduction in the passage vortex\nstrength, P2 does not show such a great reduction in loss.\nFigure 9 indicates that the loss core for P2 is larger than\nfor P1, although P2 does gain nearer the wall owing to the\nreduction in the countervortex strength. The traditional\ncorrelations for secondary loss have an implicit link with\nthe strength of the passage vortex, and intuitively they\nmight be expected to be closely linked. The reason for\nthis disparity is not clear. One possibility is that the rapid\nchange in curvature near the pressure side of the leading\nedge with P2 might induce some sort of separation.\nHowever, apart from some tenuous evidence from the tuft\nstudies carried out by Jayaraman [15], there is no con-\n\u008e rmation of this idea. At this stage all that can be said is\nthat the process of generation of secondary loss is (not\nsurprisingly) very complex and that it appears that\nrestricting the pro\u008e ling to within the blade passage\nreduces its effectiveness somewhat. Clearly further in-\nvestigation is required to elucidate this problem.\nThe comparison of yaw angles with the CFD pre-\nFig. 8 Total pressure loss coef\u008e cient downstream at slot 10 for (a) planar, (b) P1 and (c) P2 pro\u008e les\nFig. 9 Pitch-averaged total pressure loss\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A A03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001\n730 D G GREGORY-SMITH, G INGRAM, P JAYARAMAN, N W HARVEY AND M G ROSE\ndiction shows good agreement in the region of the pas-\nsage vortex when a 1.5\u00b0 offset is allowed for. The agree-\nment is less good within 30 mm of the end wall. The P1\nprediction showed a fall in overturning, consistent with\nthe strong countervortex, and for the P2 prediction there\nis strong overturning. Neither of these features is shown\nby the measurements, although it should be noted that the\nexperimental results closer to the wall than 10 mm may\nbe in error owing to wall interference effects, since the\nprobe was \u00b95 mm in diameter.\nThe comparison of the CFD for the pitch-averaged loss\nalso shows good qualitative agreement in the region of\nthe passage vortex. The mid-span error is typical of many\nfully turbulent computations of this blade (see reference\n[17]). The larger loss core for P2 is predicted as seen in\nthe experiments. However, near the end wall the agree-\nment is much poorer. The \u008f ow near the end walls is very\ncomplex and is strongly affected by viscous and turbu-\nlence effects. It is known that for the planar case there are\nsigni\u008e cant regions of laminar \u008f ow on the end wall and\nsuction surface (see reference [18]) and the pro\u008e ling may\nwell affect these. The CFD was carried out as fully\nturbulent, so it is not surprising that the CFD and experi-\nments do not agree well near the end wall and that the\nprediction of loss is not reliable.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nThe following conclusions are drawn from this work:\n1. A new pro\u008e le has been designed, manufactured and\ntested which restricts pro\u008e ling to the blade passage.\n2. This new design has signi\u008e cantly different static\npressures on the end wall.\nFig. 10 CFD pitch-averaged loss\nFig. 11 Secondary kinetic energy at slot 10 Fig. 12 Net loss values at slot 10\nA03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A\nNON-AXISYMMETRIC TURBINE END WALL PROFILING 731\n3. The new pro\u008e le shows a similar reduction in the\nstrength of the secondary \u008f ow.\n4. The new pro\u008e le does produce better exit angle devia-\ntions than the original pro\u008e le, which was the design\nintent. However, the new pro\u008e le does not produce the\nsame level of loss reduction as the old one.\n5. Flow visualization does not point to any large-scale\nseparation which could explain this additional loss.\n6. The CFD predictions, which are the basis of the design\nmethod, agree well with the experiments with respect\nto the \u008f ow in the passage vortex and loss core region.\nIn particular they predict more loss in the loss core for\nP2 than for P1. However, the predictions nearer the\nend walls are less good, and this may be due to the\ncomplex transitional nature of the \u008f ow that is not\nmodelled by the CFD.\nOverall this work con\u008e rms the validity of the inverse\ndesign method with respect to the \u008f ow \u008e eld predictions.\nHowever, at present CFD methods are not suf\u008e ciently\naccurate to predict loss with certainty. Thus, basing the\ndesign on reducing secondary \u008f ow strength and angle\nFig. 13 Planar end wall\nFig. 14 Pro\u008e led end wall P1\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A A03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001\n732 D G GREGORY-SMITH, G INGRAM, P JAYARAMAN, N W HARVEY AND M G ROSE\nFig. 15 Pro\u008e led end wall P2\nFig. 16 CFD for pro\u008e led end wall P1\nA03501 \u00d3 IMechE 2001 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 215 Part A\nNON-AXISYMMETRIC TURBINE END WALL PROFILING 733\ndeviations is what has to be done at present. In the longer\nterm accurate loss prediction would be desirable, but until\nbetter turbulence and transition modelling is available,\nthe loss con\u008e rmation has to rely on experimental investi-\ngation. A \u008e nal point is that the reduced secondary \u008f ow\nstrength and deviation at the blade row exit may result in\na \u2018cleaner\u2019 \u008f ow for a subsequent blade row, thus giving\nincreased ef\u008e ciency in that row that is not evident from\nthis isolated blade cascade study.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work has been carried out with the support of Rolls\u2013\nRoyce plc and the Defence Evaluation and Research\nAgency (MoD and DTI), Pyestock.
