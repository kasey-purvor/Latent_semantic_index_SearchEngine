Yet this is a disappoint-\ning study not only for the skeptical but also for the most\noptimistic of archaeologists. Were it actually possible to\napply \u201cmicroarchaeology\u201d (and that remains to be seen),\nthe results would probably be so banal and boring as to\nmake it the driest dust that blows.\nMike Parker Pearson\ndepartment of archaeology and prehistory\nnorthgate house\nuniversity of sheffield\nsheffield, s1 4et\nunited kingdom\nm.parker-pearson@sheffield.ac.uk\nEmerging Pathogens. Archaeology, Ecology\nand Evolution of Infectious Disease, edited\nby C. Greenblatt and M. Spigelman. Pp. xiv + 250,\nfigs. 41, tables 14. Oxford University Press, Ox-\nford 2003. $64.50. ISBN 0-19-850901-4 (paper).\nThe emergence, and re-emergence, of infectious dis-\nease confronts humans in both developing and devel-\noped countries today with factors such as poverty, lack of\n(and access to) health-care facilities, drug resistance, and\nmovement of people looking for better lives featuring\nhighly in the increases in infectious disease. These facts\nin mind make this book timely. As the preface illustrates,\nthe focus is on the study of ancient pathogenic DNA to\ndiagnose disease; this type of research was lacking until\nrecently. While this author does not believe that aDNA\nanalysis can answer all our questions about infections in\nthe past, it has made considerable advances in some areas\nin our understanding of the evolution of disease.\nI would also challenge the opinion that DNA analyses\nconfirm diagnoses made morphologically. A positive DNA\nresult cannot be directly correlated with bone changes\nbeing observed; it may make the diagnosis more likely\nbut does not prove a direct association. Does this mean\nthat biomolecular archaeologists will only accept a dis-\nease diagnosis if they have a positive result using aDNA\nanalysis? One would hope not! In any case, the cost and\ndestructive nature of aDNA analysis prohibits whole popu-\nlation studies, which would be necessary to generate real\nrates of disease prevalence. ADNA analysis will continue\nto complement morphological studies where appropriate,\nperhaps when a number of differential diagnoses are being\nconsidered. It is imperative, however, to emphasize that\ncontamination of human tissue samples with foreign DNA\n(during burial, excavation, processing of human mate-\nrial, and curation in museums), the strong possibility that\nDNA will not survive to be analyzed, and the fact that\nauthentication of results is not always done in an inde-\npendent laboratory are all problems that still face aDNA\nanalysis. Furthermore, readers of this type of research\nshould, therefore, be cautious in accepting all published\nresults. As part of a recent doctoral thesis (Chilvers, \u201cAn-\ncient DNA and Palaeopathology: Malaria in Ancient\nGreece\u201d [Ph.D. diss., University of Manchester, 2004]),\na survey of the potential authenticity of published patho-\ngenic DNA papers found that in 39 papers published on\nDNA and disease diagnosis between 1994 and 2003, 32\ndid not discuss whether results had been independently\nreplicated, 2 said they had not, and the remaining 5 said\nthat they had been replicated. This aside, this book makes\nfor interesting reading.\nThe book is divided into three parts (evolution and\necology, different aspects of human disease, and the state\nof the art). Greenblatt provides an overview of how in-\nfection originated and evolved into a disease, emphasiz-\ning quite rightly that the \u201ccontext of disease . . . can\nhardly be ignored.\u201d Martin considers the earth\u2019s history,\ndisease, and primate evolution. While this overview chap-\nter is useful, one could challenge the acceptance of\n\u201csyphilis in a Pleistocene bear\u201d and the statement that\nthere is little evidence of pre-Columbian syphilis outside\nof the New World. A conference in France (Dutour et al.,\nThe Origin of Syphilis in Europe. Before or after 1493? [Toulon\n1993]) proved there was much more evidence for pre-\nColumbian syphilis in Europe than has been believed,\nand additional evidence has more recently emerged (e.g.,\nMitchell, \u201cPre-Columbian Treponemal Disease from 14th\nCentury AD Safed, Israel,\u201d American Journal of Physical\nAnthropology 121 [2003] 117\u201324). The discussions on the\nevolution of tuberculosis would also have benefited from\na consideration of the work by Brosch et al. (\u201cA New\nEvolutionary Scenario for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis\nComplex,\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,\nUSA 99 [2002] 3684\u20139) concerning the lack of evidence\nfor Mycobacterium tuberculosis evolving from M. bovis. Gortz\nand Michel look at the potential for new pathogens oc-\ncurring in protozoa. Protozoa are hosts and\/or vectors\nand they feed on microorganisms, especially bacteria, a\ngood example being Legionnaires\u2019 disease. Cano consid-\ners the potential of using fossilized evidence from amber\nas an indicator of evolutionary change in species, and Black\ncharts the evolution of arthropod disease vectors (e.g., in\nthe case of malaria, where the mosquito carries the para-\nsite to infect human populations).\nPart 2 starts with a chapter by Baum and Bar-Gal on the\ndiversity of human pathogens and coevolution of hu-\nmans with their pathogens. This chapter is fascinating,\nparticularly for its discussion of the human HIV1 and\nHIV2 infections and their close relationship to simian\nimmunodeficiency viruses in chimpanzees and the sooty\nmangabey monkey, respectively. Unfortunately, DNA\nanalysis is often presented as the answer to all our ques-\ntions about infections. I would also argue that the intro-\nduction of large-scale medical treatments is probably not\nthe most significant factor affecting the development of\nhuman disease. It may be one of the factors, but poverty\nis very much involved with the occurrence of disease.\nHowever, I would agree that understanding the evolu-\ntion of pathogens is key to dealing with the future, and\nDNA analysis could help trace the evolution of organ-\nisms, as has already been done by Zink et al. (\u201cMolecular\nCharacterisation of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex\nin Ancient Egyptian Mummies,\u201d International Journal of\nOsteoarchaeology 14 [2004] 404\u201313).\nCohen and Crane-Kramer discuss the subject of\npalaeoepidemiology. This is a very useful review of the\nBOOK REVIEWS2005] 573\nsubject, particularly with respect to primate and pre-hu-\nman zoonoses (diseases in animals that are transmitted\nto humans, like tuberculosis). I would, however, challenge\ntheir optimism for DNA analysis\u2014virtually all attempts to\nisolate the DNA of the treponemal organisms have been\nunsuccessful to date. Comments about the earliest cases\nof leprosy being datable to the Medieval period can also\nbe countered with evidence from Egypt dated to the\nsecond century A.D. and from Britain in the fourth cen-\ntury (see Roberts et al., eds., The Past and Present of Lep-\nrosy [Oxford 2002]). Ubelaker emphasizes the need to\nimprove methods of palaeopathological analysis and in-\nterpretation of the data, including the provision of train-\ning. His research on Ecuadorian skeletal remains serves\nto remind us of the need to take a population- and\nbiocultural-based approach.\nRothschild\u2019s paper concentrates on infections although\nthere are no clear aims stated. Reactive arthritis, tre-\nponemal disease, and tuberculosis are considered. There\nare some odd statements (e.g., linear enamel hypoplasias\nreduce the likelihood of tooth survival, and [see above]\nthere is no evidence of pre-Columbian syphilis in En-\ngland). He suggests, based on his diagnostic criteria, that\nbetween one-fifth and one-third of skeletons from En-\nglish medieval sites he studied suffered yaws. However, I\nam unclear how this conclusion was reached when peri-\nosteal reaction on the bones of the skeleton can be at-\ntributed to many causative factors; there is no mention\nof the facial changes of yaws or characteristic joint dam-\nage. I believe it is highly unlikely that this is a case for\nyaws, since yaws is a tropical disease and Britain has never\nhad a tropical environment (unless all these people were\nimmigrants). Finally, with respect to my research on the\ncause of rib periostitis, there is no hard scientific data\nthat unequivocally could use rib lesions to support a diag-\nnosis of tuberculosis (see Roberts and Buikstra, The\nBioarchaeology of Tuberculosis [Gainesville 2003]).\nEwald\u2019s paper concludes this section and considers the\nevolution of virulence and the scope of infectious causa-\ntion. It is concise and well argued, and is a valuable con-\ntribution to our understanding of virulence of infections\nin the past.\nPart 3 covers some of the latest biomolecular research\non ancient disease, including an important paper by\nMatheson and Brian that attempts to develop a molecu-\nlar taphonomic framework. It is unfortunate that this\ntype of research was not undertaken in the early years of\nancient DNA analysis, so that we could have been aware\nof when and where ancient biomolecules survive before\nso much time and money were wasted on samples that\nprovided no results. Herrmann and Hummel provide a\nshort overview of DNA analysis of ancient disease with a\nuseful table of studies, although again there is no clear\naim stated in the introduction to the paper.\nDutour et al. consider mortality rates and the occur-\nrence of plague and tuberculosis in 16th- to 18th-century\nA.D. French skeletal samples, and feel that DNA analysis\nholds great promise for the future. Nataro et al. look at\nthe (rare) study of the archaeology of enteric infections.\nSpigelman and Donoghue present data from research on\nHungarian mummies and found fascinating results. For\nexample, three tuberculous victims, a mother and her two\ndaughters, had different strains of M. tuberculosis, show-\ning that the molecular characteristics of past strains of\norganisms can be studied, and even compared with mod-\nern strains, to understand their evolution. Finally in this\nsection, we have a summary of the now famous research\non the 1918 \u201cSpanish\u201d influenza virus from Taubenberger\nand Reid. Of course, viral infections can only mainly be\nidentified in the past by using biomolecular techniques\nsince these infections do not directly affect the skeleton.\nThe book is well written and is accessible to a wide\nrange of readers. It will be of interest to anthropologists,\narchaeologists, palaeopathologists, medical historians,\nbiomolecular scientists, and medical scientists, including\nundergraduate and graduate students. At times statements\nof fact made in some papers are not supported by refer-\nences where they should be, and I was unhappy to still\nsee the use of \u201cman\u201d and \u201cmankind\u201d in one paper where\n\u201chumans\u201d and \u201chumankind\u201d would have been more accept-\nable. However, this does not detract from the book, which\nis otherwise an enjoyable read. Nevertheless, while it\nmust be regarded as innovative in its approach, we must\nnot run before we can walk: there is yet no need to re-\nplace basic palaeopathological analyses with DNA analysis.\nCharlotte Roberts\ndepartment of archaeology\nuniversity of durham\nsouth road\ndurham dh1 3le\nunited kingdom\nc.a.roberts@durham.ac.uk\nThe Age of Bronze: The Story of the Trojan\nWar.
