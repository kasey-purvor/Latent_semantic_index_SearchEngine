They now, for instance, incorporate \npractitioners in areas such as health and social care, and professional staff who support \nactivities as diverse as widening participation, e-learning and business partnership. This in \nturn has implications for higher education governance and management structures and \nprocesses. Consideration is given to variables likely to affect institutional responses to such \nchanges, and some suggestions are made as to possible ways forward in addressing the \ninterests of an expanding range of professional groupings and stakeholders, as well as those of \ninstitutions as a whole. These are likely to involve the development of more flexible \norganisational frameworks in relation to, for instance reward and incentive mechanisms and \ncareer pathways.  \n \nIntroduction \nUniversity governance, its relationship with institutional management processes, and the \nvariables that affect appropriate governance mechanisms and frameworks, have received \nconsiderable attention in recent years (for instance Deem, Hillyard and Reed 2007; Maassen \n2003; Marginson and Considine 2000; Shattock 2002, 2006). This is partly a result of the \n  \n \n2 \nhigher profile placed by governments on institutional accountability and the associated quality \nassessment processes.  A debate has ensued around shifts of emphasis between \u201ecorporate\u201f \napproaches that give priority to the development of institutional strategy via executive \ndecision making by senior management teams; and collegial approaches that give primacy to \ndisciplinary considerations, academic autonomy and collective decision making. \nTraditionally, in the UK, this distinction has been maintained in \u201ebicameral\u201f structures that \ngive the Academic Senate or Board responsibility for academic affairs, and the Governing \nBody or Council responsibility for governance and management. However, as Shattock \n(2006) has explored, this division of responsibilities has come under pressure, with governing \nbodies being expected increasingly to demonstrate an overarching role, implying oversight of \nacademic interests insofar as they relate to \u201ecorporate\u201f strategy. This challenges what is \nperceived as the sovereignty of academics in relation to decisions affecting them, \nnotwithstanding potential conflicts of interest.   \n \nIn practice, where an institution sits on the \u201ecorporate\u201f\/\u201ecollegiate\u201f spectrum depends on key \nvariables such as its national context, constitution, traditions and influence of its Vice-\nChancellor and senior colleagues. At one extreme are institutions that are able to exercise a \nhigh degree of autonomy, and therefore have considerable freedom of choice over the nature \nof appointments, grading, job titles and systems of reward and recognition.  At the other end \nof the spectrum are institutions for whom decisions are subject to clear parameters laid down \nby the appropriate national ministry. Thus in France, the relevant national committees for \neach subject discipline continue to exert influence upon professorial appointments (Musselin \n2010). In what might be seen as a more autonomous environment, the USA, the American \nAssociation of University Professors has for several decades exercised a steering influence \nupon the definition of academic tenure and professorial rankings. In between these extremes \nthere are many variants. However, less attention has been paid to the impact of diversifying \n  \n \n3 \ninstitutional communities as a variable influencing governance or management processes and \nwhere a specific institution might sit on the spectrum described above. Furthermore, \ninstitutional leaders have different perceptions of the levels of freedom and autonomy \navailable to them in relation to their national system. They may also differ in the extent to \nwhich they feel able to accommodate changing circumstance and needs, and be hesitant to \noptimise whatever freedom they have, particularly in relation to how far they are prepared to \nchallenge the status quo.  By and large, institutions tend to conform to the norms of their \nsystem, and it is difficult to find examples of widespread deviation. \n \nMaassen (2003, p. 32) defines governance as being \u201cabout the frameworks in which \nuniversities and colleges manage themselves and about the processes and structures used to \nachieve the intended outcomes\u201d. Also implicit in such processes and structures is the \nsafeguarding of legal and constitutional requirements. By contrast, \u201emanagement\u201f implies the \noperational implementation of decisions day-to-day, including the allocation of financial and \nhuman resources in support of institutional strategy (whether this is agreed through \nmechanisms that veer more towards the \u201ecorporate\u201f or the \u201ecollegial\u201f). This paper starts from \nthe premise that the relationship between governance and management is an iterative one, \nreworked on a daily basis by those with responsibilities for institutional activity from the most \nsenior managers to those leading research and teaching teams, following Shattock\u201fs \nsuggestion that: \n\u201cManaging good governance in a university setting means ensuring that governance at \nall levels in the institution works well, that all interlocking parts connect smoothly and \nthat the processes combine to deliver an organisational culture which is robust, \nflexible and willing to take decisions on trust where pressures of timing demand it.\u201d \n(Shattock 2006, p. 4).  \n  \n \n4 \nWhile in the past, governance structures have assumed a relatively stable workforce with \ncommon assumptions about, for instance rewards and incentives, career pathways, and even \ndaily tasks, this is no longer the case. As university missions have diversified, so too have the \nprofiles of staff, both academic and professional, who comprise institutional communities. \nThis is illustrated by: \n\uf0b7 The incorporation of practitioner subjects such as health and social care, with \ndifferent traditions involving teaching in practice settings, professional body loyalties \nand  traditions of applied research.  \n\uf0b7 Diversification within traditional cadres of academic staff to incorporate groups with \nspecialist expertise in, for instance, curriculum innovation and new methods of \nelectronic delivery.  \n\uf0b7 The recruitment of professionals who support broadly based institutional projects \nsuch as the student experience, community partnership and learning support. \nIn practice, significant numbers of professional staff on \u201enon-academic\u201f contracts are likely to \nhave academic credentials and experience (Whitchurch 2008; 2009), and academic staff may \nwell have management responsibilities in relation to multi-professional teams, in areas such \nas learning partnerships and research enterprise.  \n \nThis paper, therefore, explores the implications of mutations in the workforce against the \nbackground of contemporary understandings of governance and management, and goes on to \noffer some suggestions as to ways in which more adaptive processes might be developed in \norder to accommodate the needs and aspirations of diversifying academic and professional \ngroupings. For instance, the increasingly common practice of establishing multi-professional \nteams to work on specific projects creates issues of comparability, as suggested by the \nfollowing learning support manager whose team focused specifically on non-traditional and \ninternational students: \n  \n \n5 \n\u201cThere is a difficult leadership role in integrating and managing the staff \u2026 who are a \ncombined group of academic and administrative staff undertaking similar work with \ndifferent working conditions and entitlements \u2026 the [role] requires a consultative \napproach \u2026\u201d   Such a \u201cconsultative approach\u201d reflects Shattock\u201fs concept of \u201cshared \ngovernance\u201d as \u201cpartnership between the corporate and the collegial approaches, and where a \nsense of common purpose informs the balance of the relationship\u201d (Shattock 2002, p. 243).  \n \nThe paper draws on two projects undertaken for the UK Leadership Foundation for Higher \nEducation (LFHE) on changing professional roles and identities (Whitchurch 2008; \nWhitchurch and Law 2010), as well as on the contribution of twelve international authors to a \nmonograph entitled Academic and Professional Identities in Higher Education: The \nChallenges of a Diversifying Workforce (Gordon and Whitchurch 2010). In the LFHE studies, \ndata was gathered from over 70 interviews with respondents from five institutions in the UK, \ntwo in the US and two in Australia, together with 73 respondents to an online questionnaire, \nincluding people working in areas such as learning partnerships and research enterprise \n(Whitchurch 2008, 2010). The paper also draws on the narratives of authors from the UK, \nFrance, US, Australia, South Africa and Japan (Gordon and Whitchurch 2010) reviewing \nchanges occurring to academic and professional identities across national boundaries and \ntypes of institution. \n \nA diversifying workforce \nWithin the category of \u201eacademic professionals\u201f, the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency \n(HESA) (2005; 2010) demonstrates that only 52% of academic staff, who in turn comprise \n46.5% of the total higher education workforce in the UK, continue to undertake both teaching \nand research, traditionally seen as essential elements of \u201ebeing an academic\u201f. Furthermore, \n17% of academic staff are described as grades \u201eother than\u201f than professor, senior lecturer or \n  \n \n6 \nlecturer, illustrating the difficulty of characterising emergent staff categories. These may \ninclude, for instance, teaching fellows, learning support staff, and casual appointments. \nFurthermore, in the UK, there has been an increase in professional staff, managers and \ntechnical staff in the five years to 2009, with a corresponding reduction in clerical and manual \nstaff. This can be accounted for by an increase of appointments to support, for instance, \nwidening participation initiatives, web-based learning, research enterprise and business and \ncommunity partnership, as shown in the following figures: \n \nTable 1: Percentages of staff in different categories 2003\/4 and 2008\/9 \n \n[Insert Table 1 here] \n \n(Source: Higher Education Statistics Agency 2005; 2010)  \n \nMoreover, there is increasing contractual, as well as disciplinary and functional diversity. \nCurrently in the UK, 64% of academic staff are on open-ended, permanent contracts, with \n36% on part-time contracts. More than a third are on fixed term contracts, and this includes \nsubstantive appointments as well as contract researchers. Thus the UK would appear to reflect \na trend in the US where less than 50% of academic staff are now on tenure track \nappointments. In addition, there has been an increase in people appointed on fractional \ncontracts relating to specific programmes or projects. If one programme or project terminates, \nthen the appointment relating to that component comes to an end. In this situation, an \nindividual may even work for different institutions on different days of the week. Therefore a \nrange of different circumstances exist (Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) 2008\/9), \nand identities are forming in spaces that incorporate, for instance, professional, practitioner, \norganisational and managerial, as well as disciplinary interests, and in extended locations such \nas external agencies and partners, outreach and offshore sites. Spaces may also be virtual or \n  \n \n7 \nweb-based, and \u201eresidency\u201f be multiple, overlapping, permanent or provisional. Thus, \ndiversification of the workforce is occurring over time and also spatially, on a number of \nlevels. \n \nSuch changes have stimulated an intermingling of academic and professional activity within \ntraditional organisational structures. Not only do significant numbers of professional staff \nhave academic credentials and experience, but academic staff who are assigned a co-\nordinating role in an area such as widening participation may have management \nresponsibilities, and develop interests in Mode 2 forms of institutional research (Gibbons, \nLimoges et al 1994). As a result, what Whitchurch has termed a \u201cThird Space\u201d has emerged \nbetween academic and professional spheres, in which mainstream academic and professional \nfunctions have converged and coalesced in broadly based projects such as the student \nexperience, learning support and community partnership. At the same time, new forms of \n\u201cblended\u201d role have developed within this space (Whitchurch 2008; 2009) (Figure 1): \n \nFigure 1: The Emergence of Third Space between Professional and Academic Spheres of   \n                 Activity \n \n[Insert Figure 1 here] \n \n \n(Diagram adapted from Whitchurch, C. \"Shifting identities and blurring boundaries: The \nemergence of Third Space professionals in UK higher education.\" Higher Education \nQuarterly 62(4), 377-396, 2008. Reproduced with permission of Blackwell Publishing Ltd.) \n  \n \n8 \n \nContemporary governance and management \nAs a result of the changes described above, contemporary management teams are challenged \nto develop and deliver institutional strategy at a time when relationships between colleagues \nwithin and outside the institution are increasingly complex, and institutional \u201eknowledge\u201f \nwidely dispersed. In order to make sound decisions, they need to find a way of tapping into \nthis knowledge, with implications for lines of communication and intelligence-gathering. As \ninstitutions are drawn into greater interdependence with their communities, they are obliged \nto recognise a more complex set of roles, tasks and opportunities for their staff. A \nproliferation of stakeholders and interest groups in higher education has also created pressures \non traditional structures and processes. \n \nAt the same time, governance and management structures have tended to become flatter as a \nresult of devolved organisational responsibilities, and this has generated: \n\uf0b7 A less clear division between managers and managed, with more people becoming \ninvolved in \u201emanagement\u201f. \n\uf0b7 Interaction between staff at different levels of seniority, so that an individual might \nlead a team in one setting, and be managed by another member of that team in another \nsetting.  \n\uf0b7 Management experience earlier in people\u201fs careers, for instance in project or research \nteams. \n\uf0b7 An increasing significance for information networks, inside and outside the \nuniversity, on which innovative developments often depend, and which are likely to \nbe wider and more complex than formal, hierarchical communication channels. \n \n  \n \n9 \nLarsen, Maassen and Stensaker point to a \u201cgrowing gap between management intentions and \nacademic realities\u201d, and they suggest that \u201cthe legitimacy of the decision-making structures \nwithin the institution is perhaps the key element in creating and maintaining trust and \nacceptance for decisions taken\u201d (Larsen, Maassen and Stensaker 2009, pp. 54-55). These \nsuggestions might be said to reflect, at local level, the concept of \u201cnetwork governance\u201d \nexpounded by Ferlie, Musselin and Andresani (2008), which offers \u201ca greater range of actors \nand interactions\u2026 a shift from vertical to lateral management\u2026 organizational learning, joint \nproblem recognition and solving capacity and best practice\u2026\u201d (pp. 337-338), all of which \n\u201cacknowledge the specificity of each institution\u201d (p. 341). Likewise, Benington (2010, \nforthcoming) points to \u201cnetworked community governance\u201d, representing a move away from \nmechanistic language, so that governance becomes a \u201ccomplex inter-connected polycentric \nsystem rather than a machine controlled by cogs and levers\u201d, in ways that can more easily \nrespond to nuances of policy. Thus, \u201ccompeting values and interests can be expressed and \ndebated in a deliberative democratic process, by which the question of what constitutes value \nis established dialectically\u201d.  \n \nLarsen, Maassen and Stensaker (2009, pp. 45-47) describe the emergence of four basic \n\u201cdilemmas\u201d or tensions in contemporary institutions between: \n\uf0b7 Representative democracy and organisational effectiveness. \n\uf0b7 Integrated and dual management structures. \n\uf0b7 Internal and external influences on institutional decision-making. \n\uf0b7 Centralisation and decentralisation of decision-making. \nDilemmas such as these arise partly from changing (and sometimes disparate) expectations of \ngovernments, institutions and individuals. The studies on which this paper draws noted \ncorresponding stresses, including: \n  \n \n10 \n\uf0b7 An increased inter-dependence of higher education institutions with other stakeholders \nsuch as regional development agencies, leading to ongoing negotiation and adjustment \nof policy, often at short notice. \n\uf0b7 The overlaying of formal, hierarchical lines of authority with informal, lateral \ncommunication networks between professional peers.  \n\uf0b7 Varying \u201erhythms\u201f between the activities of a broadening range of stakeholders, \nparticularly in relation to, for instance, timescales for decision-making and budgetary \nconstraints. \n\uf0b7 The difficulty of achieving a strategic overview of the interests of a range of internal \nand external parties. \n\uf0b7 The potential for increased risk if decision-making bodies do not appreciate the \nimplications of new forms of activity and staff profiles.  \n\uf0b7 A consequent need for members of decision-making bodies to receive appropriate \nbriefing and training, particularly in relation to ongoing risk assessment. \n \nAlthough \u201esofter\u201f forms of governance, as described by all the authors quoted above, would \nappear to make possible flexible and facilitative responses by senior management teams, they \nalso \u201cpresent major challenges in terms of both steering (how to sustain clear strategic \ndirection) and accountability (how to account to multiple stakeholders, with very different \nmandates)\u201d (Benington forthcoming). This is demonstrated in the following section. \n \nChallenges presented by a diversifying workforce \nDecisions about employment conditions are likely to reside with the governing body in \nbicameral governance arrangements.  However, in devolved structures local managers may \nhave delegated authority for their academic and functional areas, subject to adherence to \nagreed institutional policies and procedures.  Adaptation of the system is likely to depend \n  \n \n11 \nupon relationships up and down formal lines of authority and the extent of the influence of \ngoverning bodies and their members. Contemporary employment policies and practices \nrequire governing bodies to ensure that procedures are enacted in ways that appear equitable, \ntransparent and appropriate by those with responsibilities for staff.  This is likely to involve \nconsideration of, for instance: \n\uf0b7 To what extent existing policies and procedures are fit for purpose. \n\uf0b7 Whether they enable the institution to pursue agreed strategic objectives, for instance \non knowledge transfer and exchange, internationalisation, widening participation, the \neffectiveness of information technology, or in any other area of professional services. \n \nThe situation is also complicated by the fact that day-to-day issues often reflect inherent \ntensions, for instance: \n\uf0b7 Some academic staff flourish in entrepreneurial activities such as spin-out and \nresearch enterprise, whereas others focus on teaching and\/or have a more \u201epublic \nservice\u201f orientation, creating comparability issues in relation to, for instance, \nprogression and promotion. \n\uf0b7 Some professional staff have become more specialised in terms of their expertise, for \ninstance acquiring skills in project management or marketing, while others are \nincreasingly involved in more academic areas such as learning support.  \n\uf0b7 Despite a \u201cculture of complaint\u201d, higher education offers \u201esofter\u201f benefits such as \ncampus environments and sports facilities, as well as intrinsic professional \nmotivations. It therefore remains attractive as an employment sector (Locke and \nBennion, 2010, forthcoming). \n\uf0b7 Even though academic staff may feel over-burdened with regulatory obligations, they \nare sometimes reluctant to delegate these to professional colleagues. \n \n  \n \n12 \nTwo examples serve to illustrate some of the complexities and unintended consequences of \nemployees who do not fall into mainstream academic or professional employment contracts. \nThe first is someone who at any one time worked on two or more institutional projects, for \nwhich they were employed on separate contracts:  \n\u201cHuman resources systems aren\u201ft structured for me, and there\u201fs not many like me, and \nthey hate me... I cause them dilemmas the whole time because I\u201fve usually got three or \nfour contracts going\u2026 starting and ending at different dates, and doing different work, \nand working for different areas, and that\u201fs been on-going for four years.  So I\u201fm the \nhuman resources department\u201fs nightmare, it has to be said.\u201d \nThe work involved a mix of what might be seen as \u201eacademic\u201f and \u201enon-academic\u201f activity, \nincluding programme development for online and offshore teaching, tutoring and managing \nan organisational restructuring project. Although this person had been offered a mainstream \nacademic contract, it was more advantageous financially for them to continue on a \nconsultancy basis. Although this involved more risk, they also felt that it gave them more \noptions, and because they were known to have high-level skills, when one project finished \nthey were usually invited to take on another: \n\u201cThe interesting thing is that most areas try to retain you\u2026 when they know you can \nactually do the job within the parameters, they want to keep you, and I\u201fve discovered \nthat I\u201fm better in a project type role, rather than a maintenance role\u201d. \nFrom the university\u201fs point of view there appeared to be barriers to creating a \u201ehybrid\u201f role on \nan individual basis for this person, although this would have regularised their position and \ncreated more security on both sides. One possibility would have been, as suggested by the \nindividual themselves, \u201cto have a position that allowed you to maybe have modules in your \nposition description, that you could fill with project activity\u2026\u201d It may be, therefore, that \ninstitutions will in future wish to consider how such generic project management roles, \n  \n \n13 \ncrossing employment categories and professional boundaries, might be incorporated on an \nongoing basis. \n \nPressures upon institutional managers for modification to, or adaptation of, existing, standard \nprocedures may initially be represented as an exceptional case.  When the scale moves from \nan occasional or individual case to a situation that involves groups or recurrent cases, the need \nfor some adaptation to standard procedures increases. As well as the type of example given \nabove that allows for mixed roles, for instance between academic and entrepreneurial or \ncommunity commitments, such adaptation of standard practices might include, for instance, \nacceptance of the concept of market salaries for a specific need, or a special contractual \nprovision to attract practitioners in certain fields. Often a problem is expressed in terms of \nmotivation and reward, rather than in terms of a possible solution.  In such circumstances, \nmanagers will wish to scope the scale and nature of the problem, as well as the benefits and \nlimitations associated with potential solutions. Where the issue is not unique it often means \nthat broader discussions and explorations will be required, including some assessment of the \nimplications of possible changes.  In the employment domain, this process is likely to involve \nunions as a key set of stakeholders. \n \nAn example of a skills development manager in an inner city university serving a mass \nmarket illustrates how new forms of activity can be threatened by a lack of flexibility in \nstandard systems. Their work included teaching and tutoring, curriculum design, research into \nprogramme outcomes, developing community relations, and managing staff in a skills centre. \nHowever, their position demonstrated the disparity between institutional policy and practice \nin widening participation in that the programme depended on \u201ecasual\u201f staff, that is, those paid \non an hourly rate rather than having formal contracts of employment with the institution. \nThus, the development of academic skills in a widening participation programme was \n  \n \n14 \nimplicitly accorded lower status than other \u201emainstream\u201f disciplines. As a result, staff had no \nsecurity and would at the same time be likely to be seeking alternative, permanent \nemployment. The programme was therefore susceptible to sudden staff changes, which were \npotentially disruptive and threatened the quality of what could be delivered. This in turn \nrisked an important element of the institution\u201fs mission to widen participation, its relations \nwith local employers, and the goodwill of funding agencies. \n \nAnother example illustrates the disconnect that can occur between formal responsibilities for \nand informal understandings of \u201emanagement\u201f by those working in multi-professional teams, \nto which members contribute different types of expertise which they share as colleagues to \nachieve outcomes and if necessary develop solutions to problems.  Thus, an individual \nworking in institutional research, who was responsible for a major segment of the unit\u201fs work, \ndisplayed considerable diffidence about \u201emanagement\u201f as such: \n\u201c\u2026 in the sense that I manage [my team] I think it\u201fs only in name. They ask me for \ntime off, but in terms of management, it\u201fs a weird thing for me to come into. I feel \nuncomfortable thinking of myself as [a] boss even though I am. I don\u201ft consider \nmyself [their] boss, as much as just a senior colleague who is guiding [them]\u201d. \nAnd, conversely: \n\u201cmy management style reflects how I like to be managed, which is with autonomy\u2026 I \ndon\u201ft expect someone to come in poking around\u2026 I prefer having guidance available \nif I need it\u201d. \nTheir relationship to individual members of the team was reflected in the way they conducted \nthe annual staff review process: \n\u201cI say look, here\u201fs an opportunity for you to think about how you want to do things \ndifferently, and how you can stretch\u2026 what can we do for you to make this fresh?\u201d \nThis \u201elight touch\u201f approach reinforces the sense that higher education is \u201edifferent\u201f from other \n  \n \n15 \nsectors in that motivation is likely to be intrinsic, and that individuals expect to grow beyond \nthe precise terms of what is in their job description or contract.  \n \nPossible ways forward \nThe examples given above have implications for ways in which employment packages are \ndevised so as to accommodate and value a wider range of academic and professional \nidentities. This may require, for instance, more flexible career and pay frameworks, \u201esoft\u201f \nreward and incentive mechanisms, and the adaptation of workload models and promotion \ncriteria, so as to encourage a positive motivational climate. Facilitating solutions within \nformal regulatory requirements is also likely to involve local managers, who are close to and \nunderstand immediate pressures for individuals, in partnership with and in support of senior \nmanagement teams and governing bodies. Recent evidence suggests that poor alignment can \noccur between the perceptions of senior management teams and those of academic staff in \nrelation to the outcomes of a change, for instance strategies for recognising and rewarding \nperformance in teaching (Higher Education Academy (HEA)\/University of Leicester 2009).  \nThe process of implementation, therefore, is likely to require careful analysis via, for instance, \noption papers, and a \u201eChange Academy\u201f approach (Higher Education Academy 2010) by a \nbroadly based institutional team that explores issues and potential solutions. This is especially \nso when institutional budgets are strained or when strategic re-orientation is sought. \n \nIn order to both inform and deliver strategy, fora for discussion may need to be broadened, to \ninclude not only academic and professional staff, but also lay governors and external partners. \nLay governors can also be called upon for their experience and insight of practices in related \nprofessional spheres, for instance by asking questions about the added value of new forms of \nactivity, so as to encourage reflection amongst the senior management team. Governance \ntherefore has a leadership role in encouraging a climate of self-evaluation, although this may \n  \n \n16 \nbe rolled out in partnership with managers at local level who have a monitoring role, \nidentifying issues and possible ways of resolving them.  Improved information may be needed \nabout the implications of changing practices and ways of working, including not simply data \nbut, for instance, qualitative indicators such as the likely value added by new forms of \nactivity, and the potential loss for the institution of not taking cognisance of these; thus a \nmore nuanced assessment of risk factors. More attention may also be required to the selection \nand training of members of decision-making bodies, as well as clarity about the devolution of \nauthority and decision making to local levels.  \n \nExternal triggers can also provide an opportunity for change.  Thus, as Strike (2010) notes, \nRecommendation 50 of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education in the UK \n(Dearing 1997) urged the formulation of a framework for determining pay and conditions of \nservice: \n\u201cDearing, in particular, was concerned that the \u2026 current conditions \u2026 were \nhindering the development of the sector\u201d (Strike 2010, p. 79).   \nSubsequently multi-table bargaining was replaced by a joint approach, and all jobs in higher \neducation were evaluated by institutions and placed within a national grading framework.  In \norder to progress that task locally, institutions tended to use a \u201ejob families\u201f approach.  \nInstitutions therefore, in different ways, accepted the opportunity to create a framework better \nsuited to needs.  Strike (2010) examined various potential models, including a more clearly \narticulated \u201cClimbing Frame\u201d adopted by the University of Southampton, which enabled a \nvariety of academic pathways including those of research, teaching, administration, or a \nbalanced profile.  As Whitchurch (2009) has argued, it would be possible to create a matching \nframework that incorporates work in \u201cThird Space\u201d, described above.  Other institutions in \nthe UK are revisiting the potentiality that might be afforded by a \u201eclimbing frame\u201f model as \nthey seek to motivate staff who perform primarily teaching, administrative or \n  \n \n17 \nentrepreneurial\/community-facing roles. However, Strike\u201fs initial findings suggest that even \nwhen procedures and structures has been modified, it is important to appreciate the \nperceptions of key stakeholders such as staff, and to communicate the reasons for and \nimplications of such changes. \n \nConcluding remarks \nIssues arising from the studies described in this paper suggest that governance frameworks, \nand the management practices that support them, may lag behind the demands of a \ndiversifying workforce. Furthermore, although governance and management roles and \nprocesses have been the subject of considerable discussion in the literature, they may be liable \nto be accepted by default at institutional level. Institutions may wish, therefore, to consider \nhow the two processes interface with and inform each other, and how this relationship works \nfor them in the context of a diversifying workforce. A wider discussion may therefore also be \nneeded about the concept of \u201emanagement\u201f in higher education, particularly in relation to \nmulti-professional teams and line relationships between people who are involved in project \nwork, which often require a significant degree of creativity and innovation. The narratives \nillustrate an expectation that dialogue between institutions and staff, reflected in the way that \nindividual staff are \u201emanaged\u201f day-to-day, will be discursive in nature, and that decision-\nmaking will be subject to critique and debate. \n \nIn this context institutions may wish to review: \n\uf0b7 The development of governance and management practices that are facilitative rather \nthan prescriptive in relation to possible modifications that might be needed to standard \nemployment frameworks.  \n\uf0b7 The creation of job descriptions that facilitate mobility and role enhancement. \n  \n \n18 \n\uf0b7 The use of rewards and incentives (not necessarily financial), such as responsibility \nallowances, eligibility for special awards, and professional development opportunities, \nparticularly for those working in non-mainstream employment categories. \n\uf0b7 Inclusion in workload models and promotion criteria of activities such as, for instance, \npartnership building and development activity.  \n\uf0b7 The use of attachments and associateships to recognise crossover activity, for instance \nto an institutional research centre. \n\uf0b7 How to find ways of supporting staff who see themselves as outwith mainstream roles \nand career paths via, for instance, mentoring or coaching. \nInstitutions are likely to have their own action lists, but such an approach may help to achieve \nthe flexibility required to accommodate activity on the ground that may be running ahead of \ninstitutional strategy, and to ensure that it also contributes to the delivery of formal  \nobjectives. Judging the degree of freedom available within institutional governance \nframeworks, how these might be interpreted and progressed so as to achieve an appropriate \nbalance of facilitation and control of activities, is likely to remain a key challenge for those \nleading contemporary institutions.  \n \nReferences \n \nBenington, J.
