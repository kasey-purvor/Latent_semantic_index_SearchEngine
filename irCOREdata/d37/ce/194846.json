Introduction\nThe instrumental backgrounds experienced in both\nthe Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on\nChandra (Weisskopf et al. 2002) and the European Photon\nImaging Camera (EPIC) on XMM-Newton are rather\nsimilar, as expected from their comparable orbits and de-\ntector technologies. These comprise of a combination of\nthe unrejected components of direct and Compton scat-\ntered cosmic rays, and the flux of particles from the mag-\nnetosphere which are focused by the mirror system onto\nthe detector. Especially for XMM-Newton, whose larger\ne\u000bective area and \feld of view o\u000ber some advantages for\nsuch observations, the analysis of very extended and faint\nobjects (clusters of galaxies, for example) may be frus-\ntrated by the inability to account properly for the instru-\nmental background signal.\nSend o\u000bprint requests to: D. Lumb,\ne-mail: dlumb@rssd.esa.int\n? This work is based on observations made with the XMM-\nNewton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contri-\nbutions directly funded by ESA member states and the USA\n(NASA).\nA thorough understanding of this instrumental back-\nground is important for analysing the true Cosmic X-ray\nBackground (CXB). For many years the interpretation of\nthe hard CXB as the integrated light of faint extragalac-\ntic X-ray sources, mostly Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),\nhas been hampered by the paradox that the di\u000buse spec-\ntrum at energies \u0018>1 keV did not match the spectral form\nof the major AGN populations. Much of the soft dif-\nfuse X-ray background was resolved by ROSAT (in the\nLockman Hole for example, Hasinger et al 1998), where\nthe majority of individual sources have indeed been iden-\nti\fed with AGNs. However the ROSAT energy band only\nmarginally overlapped with the harder (\u00152 keV) band in\nwhich the spectrum of the CXB has been best determined\nby non-imaging missions such as HEAO-1 A2 (Garmire\net al. 1992; Marshall et al. 1980).\nCurrently the characterisation of the faintest X-ray\nsource populations in the 2{10 keV band is being rev-\nolutionised by observations made by the Chandra and\nXMM-Newton Observatories. Their capabilities are some-\nwhat complementary: the unprecedented Chandra angular\nresolution (van Speybroek et al. 1997) allows for negligi-\nble background and ultimate source detection sensitivity;\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.aanda.org or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20020531\n94 D. H. Lumb et al.: XMM EPIC in-orbit background\nwhile the XMM-Newton telescopes (Jansen et al. 2001)\no\u000ber the largest ever focused area for unmatched photon\ngathering power.\nThe \frst deep \feld observations performed by these\nobservatories (Giacconi et al 2001; Hasinger et al. 2001;\nHornschemeier et al. 2000; Mushotzky et al. 2000) have\ncon\frmed these promises. Chandra observations to a\nsource limiting sensitivity of \u00182 \u0002 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\n(0.5{2 keV) resolved \u001880% of the background, and found\nmany hard spectra at faint levels, thus providing the solu-\ntion of the \\spectral paradox\" (namely the di\u000berence be-\ntween the spectrum of the background and the spectrum\nof bright AGN). Hornschemeier et al. (2000) also note an\nincrease in the proportion of normal galaxies at flux levels\n\u00143\u0002 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. XMM-Newton pushed the lim-\nits further than Chandra in the 5{10 keV band, reaching\n2:4\u0002 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Hasinger et al. 2001). A de\fni-\ntive statement about the fraction of background resolved\ndepends upon solving a long-standing problem concern-\ning a discrepancy of 30% between di\u000berent measurements\nof background normalization (e.g. Marshall et al. 1980;\nMcCammon & Sanders 1990; Garmire et al. 1992; Vecchi\net al. 1999).\nIn the soft X-ray regime (\u00141 keV), there is a sub-\nstantial Galactic contribution to the di\u000buse background\noriginating from hot plasma in the Local Hot Bubble, the\nGalactic Disk and the Galactic Halo. The integrated spec-\ntra of these components vary over the sky due to large\nscale spatial structure and varying amounts of absorption.\nIn addition there may be a more uniform component aris-\ning from an extragalactic hot intergalactic gas phase (e.g.\nCen & Ostriker 1999).\nHere we describe a set of template background data\nsets compiled from high galactic latitude pointings of the\nEPIC cameras on XMM-Newton. We discuss the main fea-\ntures of the observed background and the problems the\nbackground poses for extended source analysis. Finally we\ncompare our results with previous measurements of the\nspectrum and normalisation of the di\u000buse cosmic X-ray\nbackground.\n2. EPIC\nThe three co-aligned mirror modules of XMM-Newton\neach have an imaging camera at their focus, provided by\nthe EPIC consortium. These comprise two di\u000berent tech-\nnologies: a conventional CMOS CCD-based imager en-\nhanced for X-ray sensitivity (Turner et al. 2001) and a\npn junction technology multilinear CCD camera (Stru\u00a8der\net al. 2001). The \frst type is located behind the two mir-\nror modules containing Reflection Grating Arrays. Each\ncomprise of 7 individual CCDs, closely butted, with a\npixel size of \u00181 arcsec. The PN camera is located behind\nthe third, unobscured telescope. It comprises an array of\n12 CCDs in a monolithic silicon array { its pixels subtend\nabout 4 arcsec square.\nThe cameras o\u000ber angular resolution determined by\nthe telescopes Full Width at Half Max (FWHM) of\n5 arcsec, a \feld of view nearly 300 in diameter, energy\nresolution of typically 100 eV (FWHM) and an energy\nrange \u00180.2{10 keV. Each camera is provided with a set of\noptical blocking \flters to reject possible contamination by\nvisible light photons. On-board electronics select events\nabove a certain threshold and transmit data in the form\nof a serial list of event locations and energies.\n3. Data selection\n3.1. Field locations\nFor previous missions (e.g. ROSAT, Plucinsky et al. 1993\nand ASCA, Gendreau et al. 1995) a measurement of the\ninternal background components was attempted with data\ncollected while the instruments were pointed at the dark\nhemisphere of the Earth. Subsequent analyses of represen-\ntative sky backgrounds were also made by compiling data\nfrom nominally source-free \felds.\nThe XMM-Newton pointing restrictions, determined\nby the solar array or attitude measurement sub-systems,\nprevent accumulation of data from the dark Earth or\nMoon. Initial concerns about unrepresentative camera\nshielding con\fguration led us to believe that data col-\nlected with a closed instrument door would not be use-\nful for internal background characterisation, particularly\nwith respect to fluorescent line emission. However, we are\ncurrently compiling observations with a closed \flter posi-\ntion, and initial results seem promising (albeit with low\nobservational e\u000eciency and hence low signal-to-noise at\npresent). In the meantime we resorted to compiling data\nfrom blank sky \felds. To do so with realistic signal-to-\nnoise ratios for each of 4 major instrument modes would\nimpose an unacceptable penalty on usable Guest Observer\nscience programme time, therefore we concentrate on the\nFull Frame imaging modes which are generally used for the\nfaint extended objects and which are our primary concern.\nWe considered that to minimise statistical uncertainties,\nthe e\u000bective exposure duration in our data sets should\nbe an order of magnitude longer than that of the typi-\ncal Guest Observer exposure (\u001830 ks). Again, it was an\nunrealistic proposition to observe with the 3 EPIC opti-\ncal blocking \flters for \u0018300 ks each, speci\fcally to obtain\nthese data. Therefore we decided to make use of a vari-\nety of Guaranteed and Calibration Time observations of\n\\blank\" \felds to compile our data serendipitously. Co-\naddition of the multiple \felds allows us to minimise any\ne\u000bects of \\cosmic variance\" resulting from pathological\n\feld sources or variations in the local di\u000buse X-ray emis-\nsion. In addition, any time variability in the instrument\nbehaviour will be diluted.\nIt was found that suitable \felds were almost all taken\nwith the \flter in the THIN position, as this choice gives\nthe maximum detection e\u000eciency when there are no bright\noptical objects in the \feld. Whilst imposing a require-\nment for the THIN \flter enhances the ability to obtain a\nhomogeneous data set, it does impose additional compli-\ncations for those users who have chosen to use a thicker\nD. H. Lumb et al.: XMM EPIC in-orbit background 95\noptical blocking \flter in their own observations, yet still\nneed a reliable set of background templates (see Sect. 6).\nNevertheless as the soft di\u000buse X-ray component is more\nspatially and spectrally variable than the harder X-ray\nemission components this was not the major driver for\nour analysis.\nTable 1 summarises the location of the \felds selected.\n3.2. Data generation\nThe data sets were processed using the pipeline processing\nof XMM-Newton Science Analysis Subsystem 5.2 (SAS),\nin order to generate calibrated event lists for each EPIC\ncamera. Part of this standard processing removes the\ne\u000bects of bad pixels detected within the observation.\nAlthough many of these are \fxed in location on the de-\ntector (and hence may be present in a Guest Observer\u2019s\ndata set), occasionally a pixel will become temporarily\nbad (repeated low level signals unrelated to X-ray events).\nThese were removed from an individual observation where\nthe repetition was typically greater than 0.5{1% of CCD\nreadouts (see Sect. 6).\nThe signatures of most cosmic ray events are removed\nwithin the instrument before transmission of data to\nground. To account properly for the \\dead time\" e\u000bect\nof detector areas a\u000bected by cosmic rays, and therefore\nnot available for detection of valid X-rays, a correction\nfactor is calculated within SAS, based on a housekeep-\ning parameter which counts the number of over-threshold\npixels per frame, which is then normalised according to\nprevious analysis of the average size of cosmic ray events\nobserved in the directly transmitted images collected early\nin the mission.\nAn important background component which was not\nproperly anticipated before launch, is a flux of low energy\nparticles (believed to be protons) which can be focused by\nthe mirror systems onto the detectors. Within the mag-\nnetosphere the spacecraft occasionally encounters concen-\ntrated \\clouds\" of accelerated particles. Their signature\nin the detectors is of bursts of events with few keV en-\nergy deposition that are stopped within one CCD pixel.\nThe intensity can reach more than 100 times the quies-\ncent background rate during the worst of \\proton flares\",\nand these intervals are essentially unusable for analysis\nof faint extended objects. We removed such occurrences\nin our dataset by using a screening procedure based on\nthe measured count rate of high energy single pixel events\n(\u001510 keV). Histograms of such events collected in time\nbins of \u0018100 s were made and data intervals with count\nrates \u001545 (20) events\/bin in PN (MOS) are rejected (see\nFig. 1).\nConcerns that in this high altitude orbit, a low level\nof protons might continually be illuminating the mir-\nrors, have been allayed with the information gained from\nChandra observations of the Dark Moon. In this case the\nrecovered spectra are statistically identical with a large\nFig. 1. The light curve of the high energy (\u0018>10 keV) particle\nevents detected in the MOS camera during a typical observa-\ntion. Intervals with count rates above 20 per 100 s bin were\nrejected.\nselection of observations made with ACIS outside the\nChandra focal point (Biller et al 2002).\nNext, we removed the signature of bright \feld sources.\nFor each cleaned exposure an image was formed in the 0.5{\n2 keV band (which is devoid of most image artefacts). The\nSAS task EBOXDETECT was used to perform a simple\nsliding-box point source detection, without an exposure\nmap, with a box size of 1200 and a task detection threshold\nof\u001830{40. Depending on the content of each \feld, approx-\nimately 10 objects per \feld were identi\fed and a circular\nexclusion region of 2500 radius was applied at each source\nposition. The resulting source-exclusion threshold cannot\nbe directly associated with a source flux level, but never-\ntheless analysis of the individual \felds con\frmed the esti-\nmate, based on published Log N{Log S curves (Hasinger\net al. 2001), that the cores of sources of flux brighter\nthan about 1\u22122 \u0002 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (0.5{2 keV) have\nbeen excised. According to the latest telescope PSF cali-\nbrations the above process fails to remove about 10{20%\nof their flux (almost energy-independent), implying about\n4\u0002 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 deg\u22122 of the bright point source\nflux (2{10 keV) remains. This is addressed in Sect. 5.3.\nIt should be noted that where there is no coincidence\nof point sources from \feld to \feld, this excision would\nlead to a local depression of counts in the \fnal data set\nat only the 10{15% level. Conversely a suppression of the\nremaining brightest sources by the co-added \felds leads\nto a similar level of dilution.\nFinally the screened data were co-added, and the ex-\nposure and GTI (Good Time Interval) extensions of the\nFITS data \fles carefully added together so that an event\nlist suitable for use by the XMM-Newton SAS and other\nstandard X-ray analysis tools (e.g., XSPEC) was cre-\nated.

This\nimplies that at the lower energies, the proton flares can\nturn on or o\u000b at a di\u000berent rate to the main flare com-\nponent. We attribute this to the existence of lower energy\nprotons at the edges of the encountered proton \\clouds\".\nWe have not chosen to force further stringent data cuts in\nthe background template \fles, so as to allow the general\nobserver the option of applying additional selection on the\ntemplate \fles so as to match his\/her own requirements.\nHowever it was found that in analysing the spectrum of\ndi\u000buse X-rays in the \feld, the recovered spectral slopes\nsteepened with more stringent flare mitigation. Therefore\nbefore performing the spectral analysis described in Sect. 5\nwe repeated the \fltering procedure but with an energy\nrange of 1{10 keV and a count rate threshold of \u0018<1.15 s\u22121\nfor the MOS cameras.\n4. Data characteristics\nThe useful exposure time collected is about 400 ks. With\nsuch high signal-to-noise it becomes possible to identify\nsome peculiar instrumental features. These are worthy of\nnote since it will be important to take these into account\nin science analysis.\n4.1. Fluorescent emission lines\nThe passage of charged particles through the cameras is\nassociated with generation of fluorescent X-ray emission.\nThis emission is most clearly seen in the form of emission\nlines with energies characteristic of the camera body ma-\nterials (Al and stainless steel components for example).\nThe construction of the two EPIC camera types is quite\ndi\u000berent, leading to substantially di\u000berent manifestations\nof these features. Figures 2 and 3 show coarse binned\nimages of a MOS camera in bands centred around the en-\nergies of Al K and Si K emission respectively. The outer 6\nof 7 CCDs detect more Al K radiation due to their closer\nproximity to the Al camera housing. Si K emission how-\never is concentrated along the edges of some CCDs. This\nis attributed to detection of Si K X-rays escaping from\nFig. 2. Image from the MOS camera formed in the energy band\nof Al K fluorescent emission. Gaps between the chips are barely\nvisible but some shadowing features at the top and bottom are\nevident (due to cut outs in the camera body for internal cali-\nbration sources). The rim areas of the central CCD are signif-\nicantly dimmer than those of surrounding chips, because the\nCCD lies slightly below the others, and there is thus shadowing\nof any emission from the camera body above the focal plane.\nthe back substrate of a neighbouring CCD placed slightly\nforward and overlapping the subject chip. (This physical\nstacking arrangement of the CCDs was necessary to max-\nimise their close packing to reduce dead space between\nthe arrays). Finally there are a number of much less in-\ntense emission line features at higher energies (Cr, Mn,\nFe K and Au L lines for example, see Fig. 4) generated\nby trace elements of the camera metal bodies. In contrast\nthe PN camera is monolithic and planar, so sees no Si K\nemission which is self absorbed in the large pixel (150 \u0016m)\ndimensions. In addition to the Al K background there is\na relatively intense contribution from energies around the\nCu K line of 8.048 keV (Fig. 5). What is especially notable\nD. H. Lumb et al.: XMM EPIC in-orbit background 97\nFig. 3. Image from the MOS camera formed in the energy band\nof Si K fluorescent emission.

These di\u000eculties should be allevi-\nated if the proposed background templates prove to be\nrepresentative.\n4.2. Unrejected particle background\nThe charged particle induced events which are not rejected\nby the on-board or ground processing give rise to a back-\nground component that is relatively constant in spectrum\nand which shows little variation across the detector.\nA detailed study of the XMM-Newton background\nenvironment has been carried out (Dyer et al 1995).\nUsing the CREME software (Adams et al 1981),\n98 D. H. Lumb et al.: XMM EPIC in-orbit background\nthe XMM-Newton operational orbit (60 000{100000 km)\nwas predicted to experience close to interplanetary galac-\ntic cosmic ray spectra at solar minimum conditions. A\nraw rate of 4.4 cm\u22122 s\u22121 would reduce by a factor \u00182 at\nsolar maximum. Geomagnetic shielding has a small atten-\nuation e\u000bect on the protons in the XMM-Newton orbit,\nbelow a few hundred MeV, but this a\u000bects the total flu-\nence at less than 10%. The measured rates in all the 3\ndi\u000berent sorts of CCD cameras on XMM-Newton (includ-\ning the CCDs in the RGS instrument) since launch are\nin the range 2{2.5 cm\u22122 s\u22121, which is entirely consistent\nwith the expected solar modulation of the cosmic ray rate.\nThe mean charge deposition in both EPIC cameras\ndue to minimally ionising particles should be \u001d10 keV\nper particle and, with such events typically crossing mul-\ntiple pixels, the signature of the charged particles should\nbe easy to distinguish from valid X-ray events. Actually,\ndue to the Landau energy distribution of deposited energy\nthe rejection e\u000eciency is expected to be \u001899% in the MOS\ncameras (Lumb & Holland 1988). There is also a compo-\nnent expected from the secondary \u03b3-rays and e\u2212 excited\nby the particle interactions in the surrounding spacecraft.\nIn the case of the MOS devices, there is a substantial\nactive CCD area outside the nominal \feld of view de\fned\nby the optical blocking \flter. In this region one can as-\nsume that there are no contributions from sky photons or\nsoft protons focused by the mirrors, and this should rep-\nresent the true internal background. Figure 7 shows this\nmeasured internal spectrum in the MOS1 camera below\n10 keV (outside the \feld of view). In this regime the rem-\nnant count rate after selection for X-ray event character-\nistics (the SAS attributes (#XMMEA EM&&PATTERN\nin [0:12])) is 0.026 events cm\u22122 s\u22121. Of this 0:021 \u0006\n0:0022 cm\u22122 s\u22121 is in the flat spectrum component with\nthe remainder in emission line components and a noise\ncomponent which increases to lower energies. The flat\nspectrum count rate implies a rejection e\u000eciency of\u001899%,\nas expected.\nFor the PN camera the flat spectrum component is\nabout twice the intensity of the MOS cameras. We at-\ntribute this to signals from the end of cosmic ray tracks\nthat are outside the spatial rejection mask, and deposit\nrelatively small energy signature in single pixels.\n4.3. Low-energy artefacts\nThe most obvious features in the lowest energy band are\ne\u000bects of \\bad pixels\". In their simplest manifestation\nthese represent a pixel location where a small amount of\nleakage current is integrated during the CCD frame accu-\nmulation time; this small signal is indistinguishable from\nthe signal generated by a valid X-ray event. A pixel which\nis consistently bad is flagged for removal on-board by load-\ning a table of positions to be blanked out. Occasionally\na pixel can enter the transmitted data stream before it\nis identi\fed as bad. More likely, some pixels \\flicker\" on\nand o\u000b (Hopkinson 1992) with low recurrence rate (\u00141%),\nFig. 7. Spectrum from the MOS camera in the region outside\nthe \feld of view. The flat spectrum is consistent with 99%\nrejection of cosmic ray events.\nand the e\u000eciency for \fnding them post-facto in the SAS\npipeline is dependent on many factors, so that some such\nevents may occur in the background template and not the\nobserver\u2019s data set and vice versa.\nThere are additional features peculiar to each camera\ntype. In the MOS there is a form of electronic interference\nnoise, which causes patterns of spurious low energy events\nwhich repeat every 64 columns. Fortunately their signa-\nture is easily recognised and removed by the SAS pipeline\nin almost all observations. Also there are occasions when\na pixel will \\light up\" for several successive frames. This\ne\u000bect is attributed to the trapping of a large signal from\na cosmic ray event, which subsequently is released to the\npixel site over many seconds.\nIn the PN camera there are occasional blocks of bright\npixels, typically 4 pixels in extent, along the readout di-\nrection. Their presence varies from observation to obser-\nvation. They arise from an artefact of the CCD o\u000bset bias\nlevel calculation at the start of each observation: To cal-\nculate the precise local zero signal level the average value\nfor each pixel is determined from typically 100 readouts.\nAlthough extreme high value samples are excluded from\nthe calculation, a local excess (due to cosmic ray detection\nfor example) may occur during more readouts. Highly ion-\nising events may also cause an electronic baseline droop,\ncreating a local decrement in the calculated tables. The\ne\u000bect of one discrepant sample of value several keV, aver-\naged over 100 samples is still enough to cause a noticeable\nshift in the locally applied detection threshold. The ac-\ntual readout and calculation is performed in sets of 4 CCD\nrows at a time, and thus repeated blocks of typically 3-by-\n4 pixels might be expected to exceed the threshold dur-\ning the subsequent science exposure readouts, with much\nhigher probability than normal.\nFor energies \u0014200 eV there is evidence of streaks at\nthe edge and near the middle of the array. Some of these\ncan be attributed to the same occurrences of electronic\nD. H. Lumb et al.: XMM EPIC in-orbit background 99\nbaseline droop, and\/or charge transfer loss in readout that\ncause a false event signature (especially occurring in the\n\frst few pixels of the next frame readout).\n5. Spectral analysis\n5.1. Internal background\nThe high signal-to-noise data set described allows the dif-\nfuse X-ray background parameters to be compared with\nthe estimates made using other observatories. In this work\nwe restrict ourselves to analysis with the MOS cameras\nonly, because the spatio-spectral complications of the in-\nternal background can be reasonably well corrected using\ndata from outside the focal plane area. Similar subtrac-\ntion in the PN camera will be the subject of further work,\nwhen su\u000ecient internal background data can be collected\nduring the on-going calibration programme. Furthermore,\nthe MOS CCDs have nearly identical responses across the\nfocal plane, and the average response can be determined\nby application of a simple mirror vignetting correction.\nConversely for the PN, the response varies along each\nCCD due to the e\u000bects of charge transfer ine\u000eciency,\nand the determination of a linear change in response\nwith position and a radial vignetting function requires a\nrather complicated weighting function which is still under\ndevelopment.\nHowever, even in the case of the MOS, analysis us-\ning the normal technique of an area-scaled background\nsubtraction was complicated. It was found that e.g., the\nrather variable Al & Si emission line intensities have an as-\nsociated component of redistribution of photon signal to\nlower energies. The intensity outside the FOV is clearly\ndi\u000berent than inside the \feld, and therefore, even \\ig-\nnoring\" the Al K line region from \ftting process, after\nsubtraction, would signi\fcantly distort the whole sub-keV\nspectral region. Similar arguments, but with less dramatic\nmagnitude, apply to the other internal fluorescent lines.\nIn Fig. 8 we show the comparison of the internal back-\nground component from outside the \feld of view (but\nscaled with appropriate area correction) with the total\nspectrum (including the CXB) from the central \feld of\nthe detector (speci\fcally a central \u001813 arcmin radius re-\ngion). The internal component dominating above 5 keV\nseems to be scaled correctly via the ratio of in- and out-\nof-\feld detector areas, but the emission line intensities at\nAl K and Si K require a di\u000berent scaling (this is partly\nmasked by the di\u000buse cosmic X-ray background com-\nponent) consistent with spatial variations noted earlier.\nTherefore we decided to model the internal background,\nwith multiple Gaussian functions to characterise these\nemission lines, superimposed upon a broken power-law to\ndescribe the continuum due to unrejected particle back-\ngrounds, and low energy noise. The hard component of\nunrejected cosmic rays manifests as a power law of counts\nversus energy of \u0018E\u22120:2, turning up at about 1 keV to a\npower law \u0018E\u22120:8 (this is very similar in form to models\nused to describe internal background in the ASCA CCD\ncameras). In the spectral \ftting described below, the fluo-\nrescent emission line energies and widths were \fxed to the\nvalues determined in the out-of-\feld component but the\nnormalisations of the lines were allowed to vary to com-\npensate for spatial variations. The normalisation of the\nbroken power-law component was \fxed according to the\nratio of the collection areas.\nYet a further complication is that the charged parti-\ncle events are collected unevenly across the array. After\ncollection in the image area the data are shifted rapidly\ninto a shielded store section, and read-out relatively slowly\n(\u00182.6 s) so that rows farthest from the readout node spend\n\u001850% longer in the array. The pixel size in the store sec-\ntion is less than 1\/3 of the physical size of pixels in the\nimage section, so the actual range in equivalent accumu-\nlation times is \u001815%. In addition the smaller pixel size al-\nlows for a much enhanced rejection ratio to particle events\ncollected during the store readout than those collected in\nthe image section. As a consequence of the orthogonal\nreadout organization of the MOS CCDs, only 2 of the\n6 outer CCDs have a potential spatial bias in this cosmic\nray collection e\u000eciency, hence the expected normalization\nerror in the unrejected cosmic ray component is\u001c5%. We\ncon\frmed this spatial invariance by examining a selection\nof data sets taken with the CLOSED \flter position, and\nindeed \fnd no evidence for a large spatial variation in the\nbackground except in the fluorescent emission lines.\nAt energies \u00145 keV the CXB dominates, with a clear\nsignature of low energy emission lines at E \u0014 1 keV, which\nare not present in the internal background but most likely\noriginate in Galactic thermal emission.\n5.2. Cosmic X-ray background\nUsing the spectral model of the internal background de-\nscribed in the previous section, we have proceeded to\n\ft the full background spectrum measured in the EPIC\nMOS cameras by including additional spectral compo-\nnents representative of the di\u000buse CXB. Speci\fcally we\nadopt an empirical CXB model consisting of two optically-\nthin thermal components (MEKAL, Mewe et al. 1985)\nplus a power-law component. The former represent the\nsoft CXB produced by hot plasma located in the Galactic\ndisk and halo whereas the latter models the hard CXB\nof extragalactic origin which, most likely, is due to the\nintegrated emission of faint unresolved AGN.\nOther details of the spectral analysis are as follows.\nSince the metallicity of the thermal component could not\nbe well constrained, the plasma abundances were \fxed at\nsolar (Anders & Grevesse 1989). Also the exposure time\nweighted hydrogen column density (Dickey & Lockman\n1990) averaged over all our \felds was calculated to be\n1:7\u00021020 cm\u22122 and \fxed at this value. We have considered\nan overall estimate of 2% systematic error is appropriate\nto characterize the current level of calibration accuracy,\nexcept for the region around the O absorption edge feature\nin the CCD detection e\u000eciency, to which we assign a 5%\n100 D.

All spectral bins\nbelow an energy of 200 eV were excluded.\nIn the spectral \ftting we use response functions which\naccount for the average e\u000bective area, weighted accord-\ning to o\u000b-axis angle. The vignetting calibration of the\nMOS cameras is complicated by an understanding of\nthe azimuthal dependence of the blocking fraction of the\nReflection Grating Spectrometer array (den Herder et al.\n2001) modules in their telescope beams. Nevertheless as\nwe have azimuthally averaged this factor in these ob-\nservations, we believe that the uncertainty of the vi-\ngnetting function measurement (\u00181.5% for E \u0014 8 keV\nat 10.5 arcmin \feld angle, Lumb et al. 2002) represents\nan upper limit to the uncertainty on the average e\u000bective\narea weighting applied in the analysis.\nFigure 10 shows the measured CXB spectrum (af-\nter subtracting the best-estimated of the internal back-\nground) in the 0.2{10 keV band, our derived best-\ftting\nCXB spectral model and the \ftting residuals. The cor-\nresponding parameter values plus errors are summarised\nin Table 2. The reduced \u001f2 of the \ft was \u001f2\u0017= 1.17\n(566 degrees of freedom).\nThe background normalisations quoted in Table 2\nignore the contribution of out-of-\feld scattered X-rays.\nX-rays at angles \u00181 degree o\u000b axis have a small proba-\nbility of reaching the focal plane after only one reflection\n(o\u000b the hyperbola mirror) rather then a true focus from\nthe double reflection geometry. For example, such e\u000bects\nwere a considerable complication in the ASCA observatory\nsince they gave rise to roughly 30% of the signal. In XMM-\nNewton, considerable e\u000bort was put into designing a\nba\u000fe which minimizes this e\u000bect. Ground measurements\nat optical wavelengths have con\frmed its e\u000eciency. At the\ntime of writing the detailed in-orbit X-ray calibration is\nincomplete. However measurements of the Crab Nebula\nobserved o\u000b-axis, show that the X-ray leak is within a\nfactor of 2 of predicted (1:5\u0002 10\u22123). With a rather small\nenergy dependence (\u0018\u000620% from 1{10 keV) of the X-ray\nleak, this leads us to estimate that the contribution\nof di\u000buse flux gathered from out-of-\feld angles of 0.4{\n1.4 degrees is of order 7% of the true focused in-\feld sig-\nnal, and the associated systematic error (due largely to\nthe energy dependence) is \u00062%.\n5.3. Extragalactic cosmic X-ray background\nThe hard power-law component representing the ex-\ntragalactic CXB has a measured photon index of\n\u0393 = 1:42 \u0006 0:03 (90% con\fdence limits for one pa-\nrameter) with a normalisation at 1 keV of 8:44 \u0006\n0:24 photon cm\u22122 s\u22121 keV\u22121 sr\u22121 (corrected for out-of-\n\feld scattering). The corresponding 2{10 keV flux per\nsquare degree is 1:64\u0002 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 deg\u22122.\nFigure 9 shows the contribution of the power-law com-\nponent to the whole spectrum; the residuals illustrate very\nclearly that the breakpoint between the hard extragalac-\ntic power-law and the soft CXB emission of Galactic ori-\ngin occurs close to 1 keV. This is a spectral range where\nmany instrument technologies overlap. For example, mis-\nsions flown in the past utilising either thick-windowed col-\nlimated gas proportional counters or X-ray imagers with\nCCDs were mainly sensitive above \u00181 keV. Conversely,\nD. H. Lumb et al.: XMM EPIC in-orbit background 101\nthe telescope and thin-windowed proportional counters\nof ROSAT were tuned to the detection of X-rays below\n\u00182 keV. Nevertheless, considerable evidence has accumu-\nlated for a soft excess of Galactic origin in the CXB spec-\ntrum (e.g. Bunner et al. 1971; Garmire et al. 1992). The\nfact that the EPIC cameras identify the spectral break in\nthe CXB in such a convincingly and unambiguous fashion\ndoes, however, demonstrate the importance of broad spec-\ntral coverage for CXB measurements. Presumably limited\nbandpass\/energy leverage has also been a factor in pro-\nducing discrepancies of up to 30% in published estimates\nof the normalisation of the extragalactic background.\nIn order to compare our background measurements\nwith other all-sky averages (e.g. Della Ceca et al. 1999)\nwe must account for the bright source component that\nhas been removed from our data (i.e. the bright re-\nsolved sources that we have speci\fcally excluded from our\nsummed spectra). Currently the most secure 2{10 keV\nsource count data in the bright source regime comes\nfrom ASCA and BeppoSax. We have used the log N \u2212\nlogS curves of both Ueda et al. (1999) and Cagnoni\net al. (1998) for the 2{10 keV band. We convert our\nlower flux limit (for the excluded sources) from the 0.5{\n2 keV band to 2{10 keV via an AGN spectrum appro-\npriate to the flux range (\u0393 \u0018 1:7). Thus we integrate\nthe counts from 3 \u0002 10\u221214 to 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (2{\n10 keV). This leads to a bright source correction factor\nof 6:0 \u0002 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 deg\u22122. The estimated un-\ncertainty in that value is driven by the possible range of\n2 in the lowest flux from which we integrate the source\ncounts (\u00182{4\u0002 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in 2{10 keV), and is\nestimated to be 2:0\u0002 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 deg\u22122.\nWhen we combine our unresolved hard CXB intensity\nwith the estimated contribution of bright sources we ob-\ntain a value for the total intensity of the hard CXB of\n2:15\u0006 0:26\u0002 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 deg\u22122. Table 2 lists the\nestimated uncertainties in computing this value.\nAn independent check on the derived hard CXB in-\ntensity was made using data only from inside the \feld of\nview. This was accomplished via maximum-likelihood \ft-\nting (Crawford et al 1970) of vignetted and unvignetted\ncomponents to the measured spatial distribution of events\nover the \feld of view. In this case a \ft was made for an un-\nvignetted (cosmic-ray background) and a vignetted (true\nX-ray photons) image component, with a vignetting func-\ntion of the form described by the XMM-Newton calibra-\ntion database. Images were constructed from both MOS\ndatasets in 150 eV wide bands, and \ft individually; un-\ncertainties were determined during the \fts using the \u0001C\nstatistic (Cash 1979). The maximum likelihood \ftting was\nunable to constrain the vignetted component above 5 keV.\nThe \ftted intensities of the vignetted component were\nthen averaged between the two MOS detectors, and cast\nas a spectrum suitable for use with XSPEC. Energy bins\ncorresponding to the strong instrumental Al K and Si K\nemission lines (i.e. between 1.3 and 1.9 keV) and where\nthe Galactic background is signi\fcant (below 1 keV) were\nexcluded.

The spectral\nslope in this case steepens to \u00181.45, as expected for the\naddition of the brighter steeper spectrum sources.\nWe also measured the brightest of the excluded\nsources, and determined it to have a flux of 6 \u0002\n10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (2{10 keV). This is consistent with the\nsource count prediction for a total \feld of 1.3 square de-\ngrees, con\frming that integration to higher fluxes from\nthis point requires a minimal correction.\nOur derived flux of the hard CXB signal compares well\nwith the BeppoSAX (Vecchi et al. 1999) and Wisconsin\n(McCammon & Sanders 1990) values, but is somewhat\nhigher than the HEAO-1 value (Marshall et al. 1980, al-\nthough see Garmire et al. 1992). Our result implies that\nthe fraction of the background in the 2{10 keV band\nthat has been resolved into discrete sources in the recent\nChandra 1 Ms observations is \u001870{90%. This highlights\nthe fact that estimates of the fraction of the CXB resolved\ninto discrete sources in narrow beam surveys depend sen-\nsitively on the assumed normalisation of the CXB spec-\ntrum and the corrections applied for the contribution of\nbright sources (which must be deduced from wide area\nsurveys) { see for example, Baldi et al. (2001). The e\u000bects\nof \feld-to-\feld cosmic variance (which as yet are largely\nunquanti\fed) may also be important.\n5.3.1. Galactic background\nWe \fnd that the soft CXB spectrum is well modelled by\ntwo thermal components with temperatures of 0.07 and\n0.20 keV respectively (see Table 3). Kuntz & Snowden\n(2000) describe a re-analysis of ROSAT survey data,\n102 D. H. Lumb et al.: XMM EPIC in-orbit background\nFig. 9. Comparison of the overall CXB measured in the 2 MOS cameras with the power-law extragalactic component. The lower\npanel shows the ratio between measured background and a power law with \u0393 = 1:42. At the highest energies there is evidence\nfor poor subtraction of fluorescent emission lines in Ni, Cu and Au.\nutilizing di\u000berent energy-band intensity ratios. For high\ngalactic latitudes they estimated that after correction for\nany Local Hot Bubble component, a best \ft two tem-\nperature model with kT = 0:099+0:054\u22120:037 keV and kT =\n0:24+0:08\u22120:03 keV provided a good description of the mea-\nsured ROSAT spectrum. This agrees within the errors\nof our own estimate. We note that the emission line ra-\ntios provide the key information for the temperature di-\nagnostics, but the truncation of EPIC response below\n200 eV prevents an accurate determination of the absorp-\ntion columns, and the 0.25 keV emission (knowledge of\nwhich is needed to disentangle the Local Hot Bubble com-\nponent from more distant disk and halo emission).\nWe made an estimate of the sub-keV emission in some\nof the di\u000berent \felds, noting di\u000berences in the measured\ntemperature and flux. This variability in emission and lack\nof detailed temperature measurement capability hampers\na more accurate determination of Galactic background\nproperties. For example, the measured mean deviation\nfrom \feld to \feld of the 2{10 keV intensity is about 3.5%,\nconsistent with an isotropic extragalactic background. On\nthe other hand the mean deviation of 0.2{1 keV inten-\nsity is about 35% from \feld to \feld. This is highlighted\nin Fig. 11 where we show the best two temperature \fts\nto several \felds, with their related deviations. It is clear\nthat:\n{ substantially di\u000berent temperatures and absorption\nvalues apply to the di\u000berent \felds;\n{ that the residuals are not coherent from one \feld to the\nnext indicating that the instrument calibration is not\nthe major impediment to the low energy modelling;\nTable 3.

Caveats for use\nThe EPIC cameras allow a choice of optical blocking \fl-\nter to prevent contamination by optically bright targets.\nFor most extended and\/or faint extragalactic targets, such\ncontamination is negligible, and the thinnest \flter can be\nemployed, as indeed is the case for all the observations\ncompiled in this work. However, if a thicker \flter was\nused, the transmission of di\u000buse background X-rays (and\nany remnant proton flux) will be reduced. Therefore the\nobserver should model the di\u000berences in soft component\nbased on the response matrices and limited knowledge of\nthe expected Galactic emission.\nD. H. Lumb et al.: XMM EPIC in-orbit background 103\nFig. 10. Best \ft model and residuals to the overall cosmic di\u000buse X-ray emission.\nThe observer must take care to extract background\nfrom an appropriate location in the FOV. Most simply\nthe extraction region should be de\fned in detector co-\nordinates to match closely the region of the desired sci-\nence target. In some applications the user would subtract\ndata in sky co-ordinates. In this case the template event\nlists could be recast to mimic the nominal pointing direc-\ntion of the observer\u2019s \feld (for example using SAS task\nATTCALC)\nWe note that despite the standard recipe for \flter-\ning proton flares, the background rate as measured in\n1{10 keV bands exhibits some remnant flares. This im-\nplies that at lower energies, the proton flares turn on\nmore slowly, yet before the main flare component. While\na more restrictive proton flare screening was applied for\nthe spectral analysis of the background, we have not cho-\nsen to apply such stringent data cuts in the background\ntemplate \fles, so that the general observer can apply\nan additional selection of the template \fles if necessary.\nWe emphasise that in analysing the spectrum of di\u000buse\nX-rays in the \feld, the recovered spectral slopes steepen\nwith more stringent flare mitigation. Careful compari-\nson of the recipes used for GTI creation must be made.\nNevertheless, it is possible that the lowest level proton\nfluxes are spectrally variable, and no complete subtrac-\ntion is possible.\nAlthough point sources have been removed or signi\f-\ncantly diluted, careful examination of the images derived\nfrom these event lists reveals signi\fcant intensity fluctu-\nations. On scales of arcminutes appropriate to extended\nsources, this is not expected to be a signi\fcant problem,\nand indeed representative of the unresolved background.\nHowever, if the user extracts spectra from regions com-\nparable with the mirror point spread function scale, then\nmanual inspection is necessary to guard against variations\nin counts arising from treatment of point sources in the\ntemplate \fles.\nAs noted previously there are particular defects to be\nexpected in the lowest energy (\u00140.3 keV) spectral ranges.\nFurthermore, at the time of writing, the calibration of the\nEPIC soft X-ray spectral response awaits completion. The\ntransmission of \flters at energies \u0014250 eV is di\u000ecult to\nmeasure, the CCDs\u2019 calibration at the ground synchrotron\nfacility was not performed at energies \u0014150 eV and the\ndetailed redistribution of signal from photons of energies\n\u00181 keV into partially collected events in the softest band\nwas also not determined completely in ground measure-\nments. For the time being spectral analysis below 250 eV\nshould be treated with caution.\nFor the highest quality determination of the back-\nground appropriate to the observer\u2019s own data the fol-\nlowing steps should be employed. It is intended to pro-\nvide tools within the XMM-Newton SAS environment to\nachieve this, but most steps can be performed manually\n(see for example Majerowicz & Neumann 2001).\n{ Following suitable flare screening, de\fne a background\nregion (B) and extract the observed spectrum (Cback)\nfrom the observer\u2019s data set. From an identical re-\ngion in the template \fle the observed spectrum (Tback)\nshould provide a measure of variability of CR compo-\nnent by checking count rates for E \u0018> 5 keV and\/or\nthe fluorescent emission line normalisations.\n{ To estimate a better internal background spectrum for\nthe observer\u2019s data set (Cinst), determine a predicted\ncosmic background spectrum for the observer\u2019s region\nbased on ROSAT All Sky Survey maps, hydrogen\ncolumn etc. An experimental tool is available at\n104 D. H. Lumb et al.: XMM EPIC in-orbit background\nFig. 11. Comparison of the sub-keV spectra of a number of \felds highlighting the wide range of measured surface brightness.\nHEASARC web site to aid this (Sabol 2001). Create\nresponse matrices for the background region (here is\nwhere the e\u000bect of di\u000berent \flters can be introduced).\nFold this cosmic spectrum through the response\nmatrices to obtain a predicted cosmic component for\nthe background region, (Ccos).\nCinst = Cback \u2212 Ccos.\n{ A similar approach with the template \fles showed\nthat with a weighted average NH of 1:7 \u0002 1020 cm\u22122,\nand a 0.2 keV thermal spectrum determined from\nour spectral \ftting, the HEASARC tool predicts\na ROSAT R45 PSPC count rate of 1.3 s\u22121 in a\n144 arcmin2 \feld, and a 0:47\u22121:21 (ROSAT band)\nflux of 1:67\u0002 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. This could likewise\nbe used to make an estimate of the internal back-\nground of the template \fle region in order to better\nestimate the scaling factor (K) for the cosmic ray\ncomponent.\nTinst = Tback \u2212 Tcos and K \u0018 Cinst=Tinst.\n{ Repeating the same exercise for the source region in\nboth template and observed data sets could lead to\na predicted background data spectrum comprising the\nscaled internal component, and the predicted galactic\ncomponent with the appropriate \flter responses.\n7. Conclusions\nProper treatment of the background observed in the\nXMM-Newton EPIC cameras is very important for spec-\ntral and spatial analysis of faint extended objects.\nThe template background \fles described provide a very\nhigh signal-to-noise characterisation of the high en-\nergy (\u00151 keV) background suitable for such analysis.\nThe sub-keV background is consistent with models of the\nGalactic di\u000buse emission, but is spatially and spectrally\nvariable, and needs indirect arguments to provide an accu-\nrate subtraction. The extragalactic power-law background\ncomponent has been measured, and is consistent in mea-\nsured power-law index with previous data. The normal-\nization measured is in good agreement with, and pro-\nvides an important additional constraint of the fraction of\nbackground resolved into point sources by Chandra and\nXMM-Newton.\nAcknowledgements.
