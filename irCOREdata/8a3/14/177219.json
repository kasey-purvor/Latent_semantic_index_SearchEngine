MacCallum, Luis Castillo, Alistair J. P. Brown, Neil A. R. Gow, Frank C. Odds*\nAberdeen Fungal Group, Institute of Medical Sciences, Aberdeen, United Kingdom\nAbstract\nBackground: The mouse intravenous challenge model of Candida albicans infection is widely used to determine aspects of\nhost-fungus interaction. We investigated the production of cytokines in the kidneys and spleen of animals up to 48 h after\nchallenge with virulent and attenuated isolates and related these responses to semi-quantitative estimations of\nhistopathological changes in the kidney.\nMethodology\/Principal Findings: Progression of Candida albicans infection of the kidney in response to highly virulent\nfungal strains was characterized by higher levels of host cellular infiltrate, higher lesion densities and greater quantities of\nfungal elements at 24 and 48 h, and by higher kidney concentrations of IL-1b, MCP-1, KC, IL-6, G-CSF, TNF, MIP-2 and MIP-\n1b, among the immune effectors measured. Levels of the chemokine KC as early as 12 h after challenge correlated\nsignificantly with all later measurements of lesion severity. Early renal IL-6 and MIP-1b concentrations also correlated with\nsubsequent damage levels, but less significantly than for KC. All chemokines tested appeared in kidney homogenates, while\nmost of the cytokines were undetectable in kidney and spleen homogenates. GM-CSF and IL-10 showed inverse correlations\nwith measures of lesion severity, suggesting these alone may have exerted a defensive role. Spleen levels of KC at all times\nshowed significant associations with kidney lesion measurements.\nConclusions\/Significance: Elevated chemokine levels, including KC, represent the earliest responses to C. albicans infection\nin the mouse kidney. Fungal strains of low mouse virulence stimulate a lower innate response and less host infiltrate than\nmore virulent strains. These findings are consistent with immunopathological damage to kidneys in the mouse C. albicans\ninfection model and with growing evidence implicating some TLR pathways as the main point of interaction between\nfungal surface polysaccharides and leukocytes.\nCitation: MacCallum DM, Castillo L, Brown AJP, Gow NAR, Odds FC (2009) Early-Expressed Chemokines Predict Kidney Immunopathology in Experimental\nDisseminated Candida albicans Infections.

Consid-\nerable research effort has gone into understanding fungal virulence\nfactors [3,4,5] and host immunity [6,7,8] in experimental C. albicans\ninfections in mice. For very many years, the mouse model for\ndisseminated Candida infection has involved intravenous (IV)\ninjection of a yeast inoculum, with time to mortality and viable\nfungal burdens in tissues the main markers of differences in\nvirulence of fungal strains and mutants, or of differences in mouse\nsusceptibility to fungal challenge [9,10,11].\nThe kidney is the principal target organ for infection in the\nmouse IV challenge model and, while sepsis has been evidenced as\nthe major cause of death in the mouse model [9], the extent of\nkidney damage in animals showing severe symptoms is consider-\nable and is likely to contribute to the overall pathology of the\ndisease [9,11]. It has been recognized for many years that the\ndisease processes in C. albicans-infected kidneys result in heavy host\nleukocyte infiltrates and micro-abscess formation [12]. This\nprocess suggests a contribution of host immune responses to tissue\ndamage in the kidney, a contribution long recognized [13] and\nwell accepted [14] for many bacterial infections. Hence we set out\nto explain the pathological basis for kidney damage following C.\nalbicans infection.\nThe kidney is not the only organ affected in the mouse C.\nalbicans challenge model. Invasion of the brain by C. albicans occurs\nin animals receiving high challenge doses [11]. In the spleen, lungs\nand liver, viable fungi are gradually cleared even while infection\ndamage progresses in the kidneys [10,11]. Detailed studies of\npathological events in the mouse model indicate that changes\nassociated with disease become measurable within 3 days of\nchallenge with C. albicans, including body weight, systolic blood\npressure, blood glucose, urea, chloride and creatinine levels [9].\nThe mouse IV challenge model is a highly reproducible, long-\nstanding, and widely used test for investigations into host-fungus\ninteractions and efficacy of antifungal agents. However, evaluation of\nvirulence effects solely in terms of kidney burdens and survival times\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e6420\nseems a rather crude and unsophisticated approach against which to\nexamine host immune responses when compared to current\ntechnologies which permit determination of levels of individual\ncytokines, enumeration of leukocytes of different receptor types and\ngeneration of RNA expression profile data for host and fungal cells.\nConsistent experimental evidence indicates that early innate\nimmune responses, rather than adaptive responses, are essential for\nprotection of mice against IV C. albicans challenge [7,8,15] and\nprogress has been made ex vivo and in vivo towards identification of\nspecific interactions between leukocyte receptors involved in innate\nresponses and different surface polysaccharides in C. albicans \u2014 the\nso-called \u2018pathogen-associated molecular patterns\u2019 (PAMPs) [16].\nSpellberg and colleagues concluded that failure of the kidney to halt\nprogression of C. albicans infection correlates with cytokines produced\nlocally in the infected organ, rather than with systemic immune\nresponses, as represented by cytokine production in splenic cells [10].\nThe long-standing view has been that overall protective vs. non-\nprotective immunity to C. albicans challenge depends on a response\ndominated by Th1 rather than Th2 cells (and this response is at least\npartly a function of mouse genes Carg1 and Carg2 [7]). However,\nrecent work by Romani\u2019s group suggests that IL-17-producing cells,\ninduced subsequent to the immediate innate responses to C. albicans,\npromote damaging inflammation and impair the anti-Candida effects\nof neutrophils at sites of gastric infection (reviewed in [8]).\nC. albicans yeast cells that have been transported from the\nbloodstream into visceral organs in experimentally infected mice\ncan be thought of as encountering a changing microenvironment\nwith progression of time. At first the fungi engage with a succession\nof innate-immunity leukocytes then later lymphocytes, all involved\nin a complex chemical cross-talk based at the earliest stages on\nproduction of a mixture of chemokines and cytokines by host\nleukocytes, and of surface polysaccharides and secreted proteins by\nthe fungus. At any temporal stage, the balance between\nelimination of the fungal cells and local damage at the site of\ninfection will depend on the responses both of the leukocytes and\nthe fungus to this array of effector molecules and cells. When an\nimmune response is characterized as predominantly Th1 or Th2,\nthis reflects the overall outcome of the fungus-host interaction, but\ndoes not indicate the component events that led to that outcome.\nWe hypothesized that a more detailed picture of the host-fungus\ninteractions that occur in a kidney infected with C. albicans could be\nobtained by measurement of a greater number of chemokines and\ncytokines than has previously been attempted, and by semi-\nquantitative histopathological analysis of the lesions. By infecting\nmice with a set of C. albicans strains chosen to represent examples\nknown to be of high and low virulence in the mouse model we aimed\nto differentiate host responses and lesion parameters that correlate\nwith survival and non-survival of the experimental infection. Because\nthe available evidence suggests that the early stages of host-C. albicans\ninteractions determine gross clinical outcomes, we confined our\nmonitoring of events to the first 48 h after IV challenge.\nResults\nQuantitation of lesions: associations with strain virulence\nOur first objective was to evaluate how well the three new semi-\nquantitative histopathology measurements, viz. lesion density, C.\nalbicans pixels per lesion and infiltrate pixels per mm2 kidney (Fig. 1),\ncompared with viable kidney burdens, the conventional measure-\nments of infection progression in the mouse model. Fig. 2 shows the\ndata for the four lesion parameters at 24 and 48 h, and, additionally,\nat 12 h for viable kidney burdens. Error bars were often substantial\nbecause only 3 mice were analyzed per time point for each strain.\nThe data showed an increase in each measurement from 24 h to\n48 h for the majority of infecting strains. Two of the least virulent\nstrains, HUN96 and pmr1D (Table 1) showed a decrease in viable\nkidney burdens between 24 and 48 h (Fig. 2a), while the highest\nburdens at 48 h were for AM2003-020, J951361, IHEM16614 and\nSC5314 (Fig. 2a), which were 4 of the 5 most virulent strains in a\nprevious study (Table 1). The highest densities of PAS-positive\npixels, representing fungal material in the kidney lesions (Fig. 2b),\nlesion densities (lesions\/mm2 section; Fig. 2c) and host infiltrate\npixel densities were again all recorded for the most virulent strains in\nthe panel (Table 1). Thus overall strain virulence was related not\nonly to viable kidney burdens, but also to the density of kidney\nlesions, the amount of host leukocyte infiltrate and the amount of\nPAS-positive material as measured histopathologically. The viru-\nlence rank scores for the 9 strains studied previously (Table 1)\nshowed strong statistical correlations with the 48 h means of these\nfour parameters (Fig. 2): mean viable burdens, r=20.67 (p=0.025),\nmean kidney lesions\/mm2, r=20.74 (p=0.011), mean PAS-\npositive pixels in PAS-positive lesions, r=20.64 (p=0.031), and\nmean host infiltrate pixels\/mm2, r=20.52 (p=0.078).\nLesion parameters correlate with strain virulence at\ndifferent times after challenge\nFig. 3 shows examples of strong and weak cross-associations\nbetween the data obtained by measurements of lesion parameters\nfor kidneys infected with 11 isolates of C. albicans.

However, while levels of KC and MCP-1\ntended to rise in kidneys of mice infected with all 11 strains over the\n48 h period of measurement, MIG levels rose between 24 h and\n48 h only for animals infected with J990102, SC5314 and pmr1\/\nPMR1. For the remaining isolates MIG concentrations were similar\nat 24 and 48 h or fell from a peak at 24 h (Fig. 4). Detectable levels\nof GM-CSF were measured at 12 h for some kidney samples (Fig. 5),\nbut they remained low (below 100 pg\/g on average) throughout the\ntime course of the experiment with the exception of the 48 h kidneys\nfrom mice infected with pmr1\/PMR1.\nChemokine and cytokine concentrations tended to be\nhigher in kidneys of mice infected with virulent strains\nBy 24 h after C. albicans challenge, kidney levels of IL-1b (Fig. 4),\nG-CSF, IL-6, TNF, and MIP-1b (all Fig. 6) had risen substantially.\nFor these effectors, as well as chemokines KC (Fig. 5), MCP-1 (Fig. 4),\nand MIP-2 (where measured; see supplementary table S1), levels in\ninfected kidneys by 48 h were generally highest for mice infected with\nthe most virulent strains (Table 1). Among the kidney samples, data\nfor IL-10 alone (Fig. 6) showed no consistent trend. Mean levels of IL-\n10 for kidneys from mice infected with pmr1D and AM2003\/0074\nwere higher than for mice infected with the other 9 strains throughout\nthe time course. At 24 h kidney levels of RANTES (Fig. 5) were also\nhigher in mice infected with the more virulent strains, but this pattern\nwas lost by 48 h. Among the 20 cytokines and chemokines measured\nin kidney samples 12, 24 and 48 h after challenge, IFN-c, IL-2, IL-3,\nIL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-12p70, IL-13 and IL-17 levels were undetectable\nin more than 90% of kidney samples at any time. To confirm this\nunexpected negative finding we retested IFN-c and IL-12p70 by\nimmunoassay as many samples as residual homogenate volumes\nallowed, together with two homogenates spiked with IFN-c and IL-\n12p70. The results estimated the spiked cytokine levels to within 20%\nof the spiked concentrations, but confirmed there were no detectable\nlevels of the cytokines listed above in the native samples. In spleen\nsamples, the same cytokines plus G-CSF, IL-6 and TNF were\nundetectable in more than 90% of samples. Hence data for these\nimmune effectors were not analyzed further.\nCytokine and chemokine levels in spleen differed\nmarkedly from those in kidney samples\nIn spleen samples from mice infected with 11 C. albicans strains,\nchemokine KC and cytokine IL-1b were present at easily\nFigure 3.

G-CSF, IL-6 and TNF, which\nwere found in 24 h and 48 h kidney samples, were undetectable at\nall times in spleens. RANTES concentrations in spleen (Fig. 5)\nfollowed a time course different from all other cytokines and\nchemokines measured. Mean control levels of this chemokine in\nspleen from saline-injected mice were 4300 pg\/g at 12 h,\n7500 pg\/g at 24 h and 6400 at 48 h. These values exceeded the\nconcentrations measured for spleen samples from C. albicans-\ninfected animals at all three times, indicating downregulation of\nthis chemokine in response to infection. By 48 h, spleen RANTES\nconcentrations from most infected animals were still lower than\ncontrols (Fig. 5) but showed recovery from their 24 h low values.\nThe highest RANTES spleen levels at 48 h were measured for\nmice infected with the least virulent isolates.\nBy 48 h, GM-CSF levels in spleens were greater than those in\nkidney samples (Fig. 5). However, apart from GM-CSF and\nRANTES, the spleen chemokine and cytokine responses to C.\nalbicans infection were of a lower magnitude than responses in the\nkidney (Figs. 4\u20136). MIG levels in spleen at 48 h were highest for\nmice infected with the lowest virulence strains, while MCP-1 levels\nin spleens at 48 h were highest for mice infected with the most\nvirulent strains. Spleen levels of IL-10 (details not shown), like\nthose of IL-10 in the kidney (Fig. 6) were generally low at all times,\nwith means never exceeding 300 pg\/g, and similar to the kidney\nsamples, showed no clear trends over the 48 h period of\nmeasurement.\nStatistical associations confirm KC as an early predictor of\nkidney damage\nThe tendency for higher levels of some cytokines and\nchemokines to develop in the kidneys of mice infected with the\nmost virulent C. albicans strains (Figs. 4\u20136) was reflected in a\nstatistical analysis of associations between measurements of\nimmune effectors and lesion parameters. Fig. 7 shows examples\nof strongly and weakly associated lesion parameters and cytokine\nor chemokine levels.\nThe associations between immune mediators and lesion\nparameters were explored in detail by statistical analysis for\nsignificant correlations between cytokine or chemokine levels at\neach of 3 sample times vs kidney lesion parameters at 24 and 48 h\n(Table 3). Associations are shown both as Pearson\u2019s correlation\ncoefficients (r) and as F-ratios from univariate ANOVA tests.\nTable 4 reduces Table 3 to a simpler list of associations, in which\ncytokine or chemokine measurements that showed 3 or fewer\nstatistically significant associations with lesion data at all\nmeasurement times have been omitted. The values of r and F\nhave been replaced with a score from 0 to 4 that indicates the\nstatistical strength of each association. In this system, 0 indicates\nno statistically significant association, and the score is increased by\n1 for each r or F value significant at p,0.01, and by 2 for each r or\nF value significant at p,0.001.\nFrom the overview of associations provided in Table 4 it can be\nseen that the earliest strong association between immune effector\nconcentrations and kidney lesion parameters were for KC\nconcentrations in the kidneys at 12 h, which significantly\nassociated with 24 h data for lesion densities, C. albicans pixels,\ninfiltrate pixels and viable burdens. Kidney levels of MIP-1b and\nIL-6 at 12 h also correlated, but less strongly than for 12 h KC\nlevels, with two lesion parameters at 24 h.\nIn general, 24 h cytokine concentrations in the kidney showed\nthe highest level of statistical association with kidney lesions\n(Table 4), with 24 h measurements of IL-6, KC, MIP-2, TNF, G-\nCSF, IL-1 b, MCP-1 and MIG significantly correlated with all 4\nlesion parameters at 24 h. Many of the correlations also remained\nsignificantly correlated with 48 h lesion parameters (Tables 3 and\n4). G-CSF alone showed a higher level of significant correlation\nbetween its kidney concentration at 48 h and 48 h lesions. For the\nother chemokines and cytokines, kidney concentrations at 48 h\nshowed less or no correlation with lesion parameters. These data\nwere consistent with a temporal pattern of immune effector\nproduction in the kidneys in response to C. albicans challenge in\nwhich levels of most effectors correlated with number and severity\nof lesions, with KC, MIP-1 b and IL-6 the earliest lesion-\ncorrelated molecules to appear and G-CSF the latest.\nFor GM-CSF and IL-10 the sign of the correlation coefficients\nwas predominantly negative (Table 3), indicating that higher levels\nof these two effectors were associated with lower levels of kidney\ndamage. For all other chemokines and cytokines measured in the\nkidneys the correlations were positive\nAn unexpected finding was a correlation between levels of some\nimmune effectors in the spleen and lesions in the kidney. Spleen\nKC, at all three sample times, showed statistically significant\nTable 2.

Its main role is as a\nchemoattractant in mobilization of leukocyte infiltrates. A recent\nmouse study showed that resident tissue macrophages are the main\nsource of KC and MIP-2 [17], although all types of kidney cells\nare able to express cytokines and chemokines in vitro [18]. KC and\nMIP-2 are both transcriptionally regulated by signalling through\nTLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 [17]; with TLR2 and TLR4 well\nestablished as primary receptors in recognition of C. albicans\npolysaccharides and susceptibility to experimental systemic C.\nalbicans infection [16,19]. The effect of KC and MIP-2 production\nis \u2018\u2018robust neutrophil recruitment\u2019\u2019 to the site of infection [17]. We\ntherefore hypothesize that KC production, a result of the\ninteraction between C. albicans surface mannans and glucans and\ntoll-like receptors, is a critical early event that mobilizes the host\ninfiltrates seen in the kidney.\nAmong the many host-fungus correlations of interest in this\nstudy is the consistent finding that more severe disease (higher\nlesion densities, C. albicans pixels and viable tissue burdens),\nresulting from the most virulent challenge strains, associates with\nhigher levels of host leukocyte infiltrates (Table 2), as well as with\nkidney levels of many cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, KC, MIP-\n1b, MIP-2, TNF, G-CSF, MCP-1 and MIG dominate the list in\nTable 4). We consider these results suggest that a heightened host\n(innate) immune response to C. albicans in the mouse model may\nworsen kidney pathology by generating inflammation, rather than\nprotecting the host. A very extensive literature, dating back many\nyears, defines innate immune responses based on polymorphonu-\nclear leukocytes (PMNs) and macrophages as the principal cellular\nelements of defense against C. albicans invasion, responsible for\nphagocytosis and intracellular killing of the fungi (examples of\nreviews are [16,19,20]). However, as was first shown [21] and\nconfirmed [22] many years ago, virulent C. albicans isolates are\nmore likely than others to kill and escape from PMNs in vitro. The\nFigure 5.

Moreover, the generally adverse patholog-\nical role of inflammatory responses to many types of infection has\nbeen recognized since the 1970s [13]. However, the emphasis of\nresearch into anti-Candida phagocytic function by host leukocytes\nhas assumed this function is purely defensive. While innate\nresponses have been shown to contribute to pathological changes\nin the human vagina in experimental C. albicans challenge\nexperiments [23], relatively few studies have generated direct\nevidence for any tissue-damaging role of host innate immune\nresponses in the mouse disseminated C. albicans infection model\n[24]. The view of phagocytosis purely as a host defense against C.\nalbicans infection is challenged by the empirical observation of\nmicro-abscess formation in kidneys [12]: our data show the host-\nfungus interaction in the C. albicans mouse challenge model is\ncomparable with that well-known for bacterial infections in which\nphagocytic processes contribute to host damage [14].\nThe evidence from the present study shows unequivocally that\nkidney tissue damage is related quantitatively to the level of the host\ninnate response. This finding is also in accordance with the\ngrowing body of evidence showing lowered cytokine production\nfrom monocytes and PMNs stimulated in vitro with virulence-\nattenuated C. albicans mutants bearing deficient or abnormal cell-\nwall polysaccharides [16,25\u201327]. If innate responses have a purely\ndefensive role, then such reduced cytokine production should\nresult in greater fungal proliferation in vivo. From the evidence of\nthe present study, C. albicans strains naturally attenuated in gross\nvirulence for mice, including the mannan-depleted mutant pmr1D,\ndo not induce a strong innate immune response at the early stages\nof infection. The studies just cited are examples of those exploring\nthe detailed interaction of C. albicans surface macromolecules with\nhost cell receptors in vitro, with toll-like receptors and dectin-1\nshown to be those most involved in the fungal pathogen\nrecognition process.\nFigure 6.

Yamamoto et al. [28] showed that levels\nof mRNAs encoding IL-1b, IL-6, GM-CSF, MIP-1b, MIP-2, and\nKC rose in macrophages exposed to C. albicans in vitro. They also\nshowed these changes were regulated via the macrophage\nmannose receptor [28], now known as the site for specific binding\nof N-linked C. albicans cell wall mannans [27]. We also found\nincreases in the kidney levels of IL-1b, IL-6, MIP-1b and KC in\nour model (Figs. 4\u20136).\nThe tissue specificity of mouse cytokine responses to disseminated\nC. albicans infection has been demonstrated before [10]. However,\nKC was not only the earliest cytokine in the kidney whose levels\ngave the best statistical correlation with all four lesion parameters, it\nwas also produced by 12 h in the spleen. By 24 h, spleen KC\nconcentrations correlated very strongly with 24 h estimates of lesion\ndensity, C. albicans pixels, infiltrate pixels and viable burdens in the\nkidney (Tables 3, 4). These associations led us to correlate levels of\nKC in spleen and kidney samples directly (Table 5, Fig. 8). There\nwere very strong associations between KC levels in kidney and\nspleen at each sample time, with kidney levels approximately twice\nthose in spleen samples. We interpret these results as indicating\neither that KC produced in the kidney enters the circulation and is\ntherefore detectable in the spleen but at lower levels, or that KC is\nproduced in both organs in proportionate response to C. albicans\ninfection, with the spleen generating less KC than the kidney. Our\nexperimental design did not includemeasurement of serum cytokine\nand chemokine levels, since our interest was in local responses to\ninfection in one organ that ultimately clears infection and another in\nwhich infection progresses.\nApart from KC, IL-6 and MIP-1b were the only other cytokine\nand chemokine with 12 h kidney levels that correlated with two or\nmore lesion parameters at 24 h (Tables 3, 4). Expression of IL-6\nhas been previously associated with recruitment of neutrophils to\nthe site of C. albicans infection in mice, and animals genetically\ndeficient in IL-6 showed enhanced susceptibility to IV C. albicans\nchallenge [29,30]. Comparison of mice lacking genes encoding\nboth G-CSF and IL-6 with their counterparts lacking G-CSF\nshowed greater susceptibiliy to C. albicans challenge in the former\n[31]. While these data all suggest a protective role for IL-6 in\nexperimental murine C. albicans infections, it is notable that IL6\n\u2014\/\u2014 mice rendered neutropenic before C. albicans challenge had\n72 h viable organ burdens indistinguishable from those of\nneutropenic control animals and higher than in mice with normal\nneutrophil counts [29]. Hence, in all situations the development of\ntissue pathology in C. albicans-infected mice appears to depend very\nmuch on relative balances of cytokine or chemokine production\nand of neutrophil recruitment to the kidney. Some degree of\nresponse involving cytokine expression and neutrophil recruitment\nis clearly required for host defense against C. albicans: perhaps a\nFigure 7.

More recently, the later involvement of a Th17\nresponse in murine C. albicans infection has been implicated\n(reviewed in [8]). However, the contribution of a Th17 response to\nexacerbation of C. albicans burdens in a gastric model of Candida\ninfection [32] has to be contrasted with the unequivocally\nprotective effect of the Th17 response in disseminated murine C.\nalbicans infection [33]. Our own data showed little or no renal\nproduction of cytokines or chemokines classically associated with a\nTh1 response in association with C. albicans kidney proliferation.\nIL-12, IFNc and, for that matter, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-\n13 and even IL-17 were essentially undetectable in the great\nmajority of our samples. By contrast, G-CSF, TNF, and MCP-1\nlevels in the kidneys at 24 and 48 h showed associations with lesion\nparameters at both times (Tables 3, 4), possibly indicating\ninvolvement of these effectors in the progression of infection\nsubsequent to the neutrophil-recruiting early activities of KC, IL-6\nand MIP-1b. Significant associations between kidney cytokine or\nchemokine levels and measurements of both infiltrate and C.\nalbicans pixels by histopathology were seen 24 h after challenge\n(Table 4). By contrast, associations between immune effector levels\nand overall lesion densities and viable cell numbers were more\ncommonly retained at 48 h. This observation is consistent with our\ninterpretation of the overall outcome of infection depending on the\nearliest stages of host-fungus interactions. By 48 h, neither the C.\nalbicans pixels nor the amount of host infiltrate was as strongly\ncorrelated with lesion density or viable burden as at 24 h (Table 2),\nsuggesting that the different 48 h parameters may reflect the\noutcomes of intra-lesional phagocytic processes.\nOur results provide clear evidence from immunologically intact\nanimals for the significance of the early host response in\ndetermining the pathological course of infection, and strongly\nimplicate KC, in particular, as an important early mediator of\noverall outcome. However, we realize these findings are strictly\napplicable only to infections in immunologically intact BALB\/c\nmice. Since other standard inbred mouse strains differ in their\nsusceptibility to C. albicans challenge, a phenomenon related to the\nmouse genes Carg1 and Carg2 [34,35], our study serves as a basis\nfor future expansion of research into different mouse strains,\nincluding mice with gene knockouts specific for the cytokines we\nhave identified as significant early factors in determining infection\noutcome, and mice immunocompromised by other experimental\nCytokine\/\nchemokine\nTime\n(h) Lesions\/mm2 C. albicans pixels\/lesion Infiltrate pixels\/mm2 log CFU\/g kidney\n24 h 48 h 24 h 48 h 24 h 48 h 24 h 48 h\nra Fb r F r F r F r F r F r F r F\n24 20.44 7.5 20.27 2.3 20.33 3.6 20.32 3.1 20.33 3.6 20.13 0.6 20.13 0.6 20.28 2.6\n48 20.28 2.6 0.01 0.0 20.11 0.4 20.04 0.0 20.14 0.6 0.13 0.3 20.24 2.1 20.13 0.6\nRANTES 12 0.00 0.0 0.18 0.7 0.18 1.0 0.11 0.4 0.11 0.5 0.14 0.4 0.12 0.2 0.26 1.1\n24 20.10 0.9 0.08 0.0 20.03 0.3 20.10 0.6 20.11 0.9 0.11 0.1 0.08 0.0 0.26 1.2\n48 20.55* 14* 20.22 1.1 20.28 2.3 20.21 1.3 20.30 3.0 20.13 0.4 20.30 2.7 20.30 2.2\nTNF 12 20.29 3.0 20.24 2.2 20.26 2.3 20.19 1.1 20.14 0.7 20.19 1.4 20.05 0.1 20.34 5.3\n24 20.10 0.2 20.25 1.8 20.15 0.6 0.09 0.5 20.20 0.9 20.29 1.9 20.26 1.4 20.31 2.9\n48 20.21 1.2 20.18 0.5 20.15 0.5 20.23 2.1 20.17 0.6 20.29 2.0 20.28 1.8 20.32 2.9\nG-CSF 12 20.26 2.0 20.22 1.1 20.21 1.3 20.19 0.8 20.13 0.3 20.19 0.8 20.04 0.1 20.32 3.0\n24 0.37 3.3 0.21 0.5 0.46 6.5 0.26 0.9 0.40 4.3 20.08 0.8 0.25 2.1 0.16 0.2\n48 0.44 5.4 0.44 5.4 0.44 5.2 0.61* 14* 0.59* 13 0.36 4.6 20.02 0.2 0.44 5.8\nIL1-b 12 20.02 0.7 0.02 0.2 0.09 0.0 20.05 0.1 0.13 0.4 0.04 0.2 0.10 0.0 0.14 0.0\n24 0.68* 24* 0.45 4.6 0.45 6.3 0.34 5.6 0.48 9.1 0.27 0.5 0.32 2.7 0.51 5.0\n48 0.19 0.1 0.31 0.9 0.17 0.1 20.08 1.6 0.04 0.6 0.39 3.5 0.14 0.0 0.53 5.4\nIL-9 12 20.37 5.0 20.21 1.2 20.46 9.5 20.26 1.8 20.40 6.9 0.08 0.2 20.25 2.4 20.16 1.0\n24 0.14 0.6 20.18 0.9 0.09 0.0 20.28 1.6 0.10 0.0 20.10 0.7 0.09 0.0 20.01 0.4\n48 0.07 0.0 20.04 0.1 0.21 2.1 20.15 0.0 0.21 1.8 0.10 0.6 0.18 1.0 0.22 2.1\nMCP-1 12 20.50 11 20.20 1.1 20.14 0.6 20.29 2.5 20.27 2.4 20.19 0.9 0.01 0.0 20.21 1.3\n24 0.30 3.2 0.20 0.9 0.38 4.3 20.12 0.2 0.25 1.9 0.29 2.0 0.61* 15* 0.35 3.3\n48 0.41 4.4 0.26 1.1 0.24 0.8 20.04 0.1 0.20 0.5 0.32 1.9 0.32 2.1 0.38 2.7\nMIG 12 20.11 0.1 20.23 0.7 20.17 0.2 0.13 0.3 20.22 0.1 20.33 1.6 20.29 0.0 20.24 0.0\n24 0.40 5.2 0.45 6.4 0.54* 12.3 0.07 0.3 0.43 6.0 0.27 1.5 0.54* 13 0.46 7.4\n48 20.21 1.1 20.11 0.0 20.31 3.0 0.10 0.0 20.24 0.8 20.24 0.2 20.42 5.0 20.38 3.4\nar= Pearson correlation coefficient.\nbF= F-ratio from univariate analysis of variance.\ncdata for mice infected with 8 of the 11 C. albicans isolates.\nAll data presented to two significant figures.

They\nare detailed in Table 1. Nine of the strains were chosen to\nrepresent the four major clades of C. albicans strain types [36], with\none high virulence and one and low virulence strain chosen from\neach clade from among 43 isolates tested in a separate study [37].\nThe other two strains were NGY355 and NGY356; the former a\nmutant with disruptions in both copies of PMR1, the latter a\nheterozygous PMR1 reintegrant [38]. These two strains will be\nreferred to as pmr1D and pmr1\/PMR1 throughout this paper. They\nwere included as representatives of laboratory-engineered mutants\nof different virulence to determine if their behavior in vivo differed\nnotably from wild-type strains.\nAll strains were maintained in 50% glycerol stocks at 280uC\nand recovered from these stocks as required for experiments. For\nroutine maintenance in culture, the fungi were grown on slants of\nSabouraud agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). For preparation of\ninocula for mouse challenge, a yeast culture was grown for 18 h in\n5 ml volumes of NGY medium, comprising 0.1% Neopeptone\n(BD-Difco, Oxford, UK), 0.4% glucose and 0.1% yeast extract\n(BD-Difco), incubated at 30uC with continuous rotation at 20 rpm\nand an angle of 5u from the horizontal. These conditions yielded a\nsuspension of yeast cells in late exponential growth phase. The\nyeasts were centrifuged and washed twice in sterile saline,\nresuspended in saline, and enumerated with a hemocytometer.\nPairs of cells, as well as rare triplets and quadruplets, were counted\nas single units, to maximize compatibility between hemocytometer\ncounts and viable counts, set up from the final inoculum\nsuspensions and enumerated the following day.\nAnimal model\nFemale BALB\/c mice (Harlan, UK), weighing 18\u201322 g, were\nsupplied with food and water ad libitum. They were weighed and\ninfected intravenously with the C. albicans isolates at a target dose\nof 36104 CFU\/g body weight. Viable counts showed the animals\nreceived doses ranging from 1.86104\u20135.66104 CFU\/g, with the\nmedian and modal doses both 3.66104 CFU\/g. Groups of nine\nanimals were challenged for each strain, then 3 mice were\nhumanely terminated after 12 h, 24 h and 48 h. A pilot\nexperiment was done with strains SC5314, HUN96, J990102\nand AM2003\/0074 to allow us to develop and validate the\nmethodology used for lesion measurements and cytokine assays.\nThe experiment was then repeated with all 11 C. albicans strains,\nand results from this experiment are presented in this paper. Data\nfor each time point were therefore obtained from 3 animals for\neach of 11 infecting strains, with the exception of some cytokine\nTable 5.

A group of control mice was injected\nIV with 100 ml saline in each experiment.\nAt termination, each animal was swiftly dissected under aseptic\nprecautions. Both kidneys and the spleen were removed. The\norgans were halved longitudinally with a sterile scalpel. Two\nhalves from each kidney were pooled and homogenized in 0.5 ml\nof sterile saline containing one Complete Protease Inhibitor Tablet\n(Roche) per 50 ml. The other two kidney halves were fixed\ntogether in 4% formaldehyde to be processed for histopathology.\nThe spleen halves were handled similarly: one half was\nhomogenized in 0.5 ml saline containing protease inhibitor and\nthe other fixed in formaldehyde. Weights of tissues were\ndetermined for the homogenized samples to provide a denomina-\ntor for viable count and cytokine level data.\nSamples (50 ml) of kidney and spleen homogenates were used\nfor determination of tissue C. albicans burdens by viable counting.\n(No C. albicans was recovered from any sample from mice\nchallenged with saline alone.) The remainder of the homogenate\nwas centrifuged at 2500 g for 5 min, and the supernatant stored at\n220uC for subsequent assay of cytokine concentrations.\nCytokine assays\nTwenty mouse cytokines and chemokines were assayed in\nsupernatants from tissue homogenates by means of BD cytometric\nbead array (CBA) (BD, Oxford, UK). The cytokines measured\nwere IFN-c, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,\nIL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17, and TNF. The chemokines\nmeasured were KC, MCP-1, MIG, MIP-1b, and RANTES.\nAdditionally, MIP-2 was determined by immunoassay in kidney\nhomogenates from animals infected with 8 of the 11 C. albicans\nisolates (see below).\nFor each neat sample two CBA flex set reactions were set up,\neach measuring ten different cytokines\/chemokines. Reactions\nwere carried out as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. CBA\nreactions were analysed by flow cytometry on a FACSArray (BD,\nUK). To analyze results, discrete bead populations were selected\nand labelled with FCS Filter software v1.0.1 (www.softflow.com)\nand concentrations of cytokines and chemokines determined from\nstandard curves with FCAP Array software v1.0.1 (www.softflow.\ncom). Standard curves (range: 10\u20132500 pg\/ml) were determined\nin the same run as the assayed samples. Homogenate samples close\nto, or exceeding, the maximum point of the standard curve were\ndiluted and assayed again. For measurement of MIG, samples\nwere routinely diluted 1 in 5.\nMurine IFN-c, IL-17 and IL-12p70 were assayed with\nQuantikineH mouse immunoassays (R & D Systems, Abingdon,\nUK) to confirm the negative results obtained in bead assays, and\nMIP-2 was assayed for kidney samples from mice infected with 8\nof the 11 isolates, to extend the range of chemokines tested. Assays\nwere conducted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, with\nundiluted supernatants (50 ml) from kidney and spleen homoge-\nnates obtained from C. albicans-infected BALB\/c mice. Kidney\nhomogenates from two uninfected mice were also spiked with\neither IFN-c or IL-12p70 (80\u2013100 pg\/ml) and the supernatants\nassayed for cytokines.\nThe concentration of each cytokine was determined in units of\npg\/ml, then recalculated as pg\/g tissue in the sample. The\neffective limit of detection for the cytokines was 25 pg\/ml: samples\ndetermined with concentrations below this level were recorded as\ncontaining 0 pg\/ml. The mean pg\/g for each cytokine determined\nin the equivalent tissues from mice challenged with sterile saline\nwas subtracted from the values for tissues from C. albicans-infected\nmice to provide a final cytokine concentration resulting from\ninfection. A negative value was interpreted as probably indicating\ndownregulation of the cytokine measured. Cytokine and chemo-\nkine measurements at each time point were therefore based on\nN=33 (11 strains, triplicate mice).\nSupplementary on-line table S1 provides the detailed values for\nall lesion and cytokine measurements.\nSemiquantitative histopathology\nTwo kidney halves from each animal were fixed in formalde-\nhyde then embedded together in paraffin and sectioned longitu-\ndinally at 5 mm thickness. For each animal\/timepoint, kidney\nlesions were subjected to semi-quantitation as described below for\none section made from the first 20 mm depth of the embedded\nkidney and a second section made 80 mm below the first section.\nSections were deparaffinized, then stained with periodic acid-\nSchiff\u2019s reagent (PAS) and counterstained with hematoxylin. This\nmethod provided sections in which C. albicans elements within\nlesions were visible as red-stained, PAS-positive material, while\nhost leukocyte infiltrates were visualized as a darker, purple color\n(Fig. 1). Adobe Photoshop CS3 software was used to determine\npixel areas of lesions and of differently colored portions of lesions\nby means of the \u2018magic wand tool\u2019 set to a tolerance or 15\u201325 and\nfor selection of non-contiguous pixels of matching color. Total\npixel counts of selected areas were read from the Photoshop\nhistogram plots at cache level 2. The tissue sections were\nphotographed at a 1.26magnification in a light box fitted with\na digital camera for determination of entire sectional areas in mm2\nfrom a predetermined pixel count calibration. The sections were\nthen scrutinized microscopically with a 10x objective and\nindividual lesions photographed with a digital camera. The\nlesional area in each photograph was outlined with the Photoshop\n\u2018lasso tool\u2019, cut and pasted into a new Photoshop window. The\nmagic wand tool was then used to determine separately the pixel\nareas of PAS-positive material and of host infiltrate within each\nlesion. The spleen sections contained considerable amounts of\nnon-fungal PAS-positive material, and defined lesions were\ndifficult to discern. Similarly, in 12 h kidney specimens, well-\ndefined lesions and C. albicans elements were rarely seen and\nseldom capable of pixel analysis. Our experience suggests that C.\nalbicans elements are reproducibly visible in histopathological\nsections only when the viable counts in the tissues exceed 105\/g. In\npractice, we were able to obtain semi-quantitative lesion data only\nfor sections of kidney taken from infected animals 24 h and 48 h\nafter IV fungal challenge.\nFrom the pixel data for each animal\u2019s kidneys after 24 and 48 h,\nthe following determinations were made: lesion density (lesions\/\nmm2 = lesion count4 kidney area), C. albicans pixels\/lesion (PAS-\npositive pixels in each C. albicans-positive lesion), and host infiltrate\npixels\/mm2. Comparison of these data for the two separate\nsections analyzed for each tissue block showed a high level of\nagreement between the two estimates. For each animal, the data\nfrom both sections were therefore pooled for determination of\naverage estimates of lesion densities and pixel counts per kidney.\nIn the pilot experiment, lesion areas (in pixels) and infiltrate pixels\nper lesion were also determined, but these measurements were\nsubsequently abandoned. It was found that determination of lesion\nareas involved too much subjective judgement of lesion boundaries\nto provide reproducible results when different operators assessed the\nsame lesion photographs. While the color of PAS-positive material\nwas sufficiently distinctive to allow reproducible assay of its pixel\narea per lesion, regardless of inter-operator variations in lesional\narea selected, the same was not true for the infiltrate pixel area.\nExpression of the total infiltrate pixels per mm2 of entire sections\nwas found to provide better inter-operator reproducibility than was\nobtained for measurements of infiltrate pixels per lesion. Hence the\nExperimental Candida Infection\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 14 July 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e6420\nparameters finally determined semi-quantitatively for analysis were\nlesions\/mm2, infiltrate pixels\/mm2, and PAS-positive pixels per C.\nalbicans-positive lesion. Additionally, tissue burdens (as log10 CFU\/g)\nwere determined at the analysis time points.\nStatistical analysis\nData were stored in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets; the SPSS\nstatistical package, version 17.0, was used for all analyses. The\nresults available for analysis were concentrations of cytokines\ndetermined for triplicate animals at 12, 24 and 48 h in samples from\nkidneys and spleens infected with 11 strains of C. albicans (9 strains in\nsome instances: see above), and the kidney lesion parameters \u2014\nviable fungal kidney burdens at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h and estimates\nof lesion density, host infiltrate pixels\/mm2 and PAS-positive (C.\nalbicans) pixels per Candida-positive lesion, all at 24 h and 48 h.\nComparisons of data were made on an individual animal basis.\nPearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, r, was used to determine\nassociations between lesion data. For comparisons between lesion\nparameters and cytokine concentrations, many of the variables\nanalyzed were unlikely to be fully independent of each other, so the\nfollowing approach to statistical analysis was used. To determine\nassociations between levels of each cytokine at each of 3 time points\nand lesion measurements at 2 time points, the 6 Pearson correlation\ncoefficients for all possible lesion-cytokine pairs were calculated.\nAdditionally, a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was run\nwith a lesion parameter at a single time point as dependent variable,\nand concentrations of cytokines at all three time points as covariates.\nFrom all analyses, a p-value #0.01 was regarded as a significant\nresult and a p-value #0.001 as a highly significant result.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Lists raw data on which analyses are based\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0006420.s001 (0.08 MB\nXLS)\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: DMM FCO.
