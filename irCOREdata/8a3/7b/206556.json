In examining this question, it is important\nto distinguish contract-based arbitration of individual claims against the State\nfrom arbitration pursuant to investment treaties. The former is broadly\nlimited to the private sphere of the State\u0092s activity, whereas the latter gives\narbitrators a comprehensive jurisdiction over public law. An elaboration of\nthis distinction, and the grey area within it, demonstrates that the significance\nof international arbitration for juridical sovereignty is its privatization of the\nauthority to define the very concept of the public sphere.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe heralded \u0091retreat of the State\u00921\u0097referring to the State\u0092s withdrawal from a range of\ngovernmental functions as well as the transfer of those functions to non-State actors\u0097\nposes a challenge to legal conceptions of the boundary between public and private.2 In\nterms of the sovereign power finally to dispose of a legal dispute, in particular, it is said\nthat States are increasingly prepared to accept the transfer of adjudicative authority from\ncourts to arbitrators.3 Teubner argues that the expansion of international commercial arbi-\ntration and lex mercatoria is reason to look beyond the State, and the positive laws of\nStates, and to acknowledge the emergence of transnational legal orders in which private\nentities construct law without sovereign authorization.4 This is an ambitious position.\nEven so, the rise of commercial arbitration does reveal a manner of \u0091retreat\u0092 from the\nclassical model of adjudication, in that a class of disputes is no longer resolved on the\nmerits by judges but by private adjudicators who operate in a legal market and whose\ndecisions are insulated from court supervision on matters of law.5\n1 S Strange, The Retreat of the State (CUP, Cambridge, 1996).\n2 J Freeman, \u0091The Private Role in Public Governance\u0092 (2000) 75 NYU L Rev 543, 546\u00968.\n3 A Casella, \u0091On Market Integration and the Development of Institutions: The Case of\nInternational Commercial Arbitration\u0092 (1996) 40 Eur Econ Rev 155, 155\u00969; S Sassen, Losing\nControl?

Note that\nrelevant treaties and domestic laws dealing with the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbi-\ntration awards generally limit the grounds on which a court may set aside an award to error of\njurisdiction, gross procedural impropriety, or public policy; by excluding review for errors of law,\ntherefore, disputes are left to be resolved on the merits by arbitrators. See, eg, United Nations\n[ICLQ vol 56, April 2007 pp 371\u0096394] doi: 10.1093\/iclq\/lei168\nHowever, in defence of the classical position of the State in adjudication, the\nauthority for commercial arbitration and thus for the power to define lex mercatoria as\na source of law is also bounded by States,6 in that this authority originates in the State\u0092s\nown endorsement of an agreement of the disputing parties to withdraw a particular\ndispute or legal relationship from the primary jurisdiction of the courts and subject it\ninstead to arbitration. Arbitration is thus defined or endorsed by the State as \u0091private\u0092\nbased on the State\u0092s decision to respect the autonomous decisions of non-State actors\nto displace the courts\u0092 competence with a mutually constructed alternative.7 Accepting\n(for the moment) the validity of this public\u0096private distinction, the rise of international\ncommercial arbitration seems to offer a less compelling case for the State\u0092s retreat than\nthe alternative scenario in which international arbitration is used to resolve disputes\nwithin the public sphere. One may pose the question, what if States went further in the\ndelegation of adjudicative authority by allowing regulatory disputes between the State\nand individuals\u0097that is, disputes arising from sovereign rather than commercial acts\nof the State\u0097to be resolved by arbitrators? Given its reconfiguration of the role of the\ncourts as the final arbiters of constitutional and administrative law, would this not be a\nmore clear concession of sovereignty?\nThe claim of this paper is that States have in fact taken this additional step by estab-\nlishing an international adjudicative system, based on investment treaties, that gives to\narbitrators a comprehensive jurisdiction over what are essentially regulatory disputes.\nIn particular, I shall argue that arbitrations conducted pursuant to investment treaties\nare distinct from international commercial arbitration\u0097where the latter engages\ndisputes between the State and a private individual\u0097because States are assumed in the\ncommercial context to be acting in a private capacity. Admittedly, it is not always\npossible clearly to distinguish sovereign from private acts of the State in relation to\ninternational arbitration. But, to the extent that international commercial arbitration\naffects regulatory concerns, its rubric is nevertheless limited to disputes arising from a\nspecific legal relationship between individual and State. In contrast, investment treaty\narbitration encompasses the full panoply of the State\u0092s regulatory relations with\n\u0091foreign investors\u0092 who are subject to the State\u0092s authority. As a result, investment\ntreaty arbitration is a much clearer instance of the State\u0092s retreat from adjudication\nbecause it replaces courts with a private model of adjudication in matters of public law.\nThe first part of this article outlines an analytical framework for distinguishing\npublic from private in international arbitration between individuals and States, based\non an assessment of the character of the relevant acts of the State. Further, a definition\nof sovereignty is elaborated that looks to the authority of the State rather than its power\nas the basis for resolving whether particular State conduct could be carried out by a\nprivate party, or whether it is uniquely sovereign. This analytical framework is applied\nin the second part of the article, in which it is argued that investment treaty arbitration\nis properly viewed as public law adjudication and, as such, that it is distinguishable\n372 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 10 June 1958, 330\nUNTS 3 (entered into force 7 June 1959), Art V [hereinafter New York Convention]; Model Law\non International Commercial Arbitration, 21 June 1985, UNCITRAL, UN Doc A\/40\/17, Annex I,\n24 ILM 1302, Art 34\u00966.\n6 F Snyder, \u0091Governing Economic Globalisation: Global Legal Pluralism and European Law\u0092\n(1999) 5 Eur LJ 334, 341\u00962.\n7 A Redfern and M Hunter, Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration (4th\nedn, Sweet & Maxwell, London, 2004) 138\u00969 and 256.\nfrom international commercial arbitration, given that only the latter is reciprocally\nconsensual adjudication between juridical equals. In the third part of the article, the\ndiscussion delves into the grey areas in the public\u0096private distinction in the interna-\ntional arbitration of individual claims against States. This leads to the conclusion that\nthe key significance of the rise of international arbitration, in terms of the retreat of the\nState, is the granting of a generalized competence to private arbitrators to define the\nscope of the public sphere and, as such, the uniqueness of the juridical sovereign.\nII. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\nA. The Public\u0096Private Distinction\nThe argument begins with the premise that it is both possible and useful to distinguish\nbetween the public and private character of disputes that are resolved by adjudication.\nOf course, there is always grey when differentiating black from white, and so it is with\nthe public\u0096private distinction. But the presence of grey does not mean that black and\nwhite do not exist. When a legislature expropriates property, leading to a dispute with\nits private owner, the passage of the legislation is quintessentially a sovereign act and\nthe resulting dispute quite clearly a matter of public law. Alternatively, when the\nGovernment contracts with a company to tend the lawn in front of Parliament, the\nGovernment\u0092s conclusion of the contract is a commercial act of the State\u0097one that a\nprivate party could carry out\u0097and its resolution by arbitration can credibly be posi-\ntioned within the private domain.\nAs with any system of classification, it may be difficult to pinpoint the difference\nbetween public and private in specific cases. But the distinction is nevertheless drawn in\nall modern legal systems, including public international law, because the recognition of\nany unique subject\u0097here, \u0091the State\u0092\u0097necessitates a description of that subject.8 The\ndistinction is present, for example, in the principle of sovereign immunity which, in\nabsolute terms, posits that one State\u0092s authority is not subject to adjudication in another\nState\u0092s courts.9 In particular, many States recognize an exception to the general princi-\nple of sovereign immunity with respect to commercial acts of the State which operates\nto remove the shield of sovereign immunity from the private business conduct of the\nState.10 To apply this restrictive doctrine, courts and arbitrators adopt various tests to\ndistinguish sovereign acts (jure imperii) from commercial acts (jure gestionis) but in\nall cases a distinction is made in order to determine the scope of sovereign immunity.11\nOne technique for drawing this public\u0096private distinction, which is adopted in this\npaper, is to examine the character of relevant acts of the State and ask whether they are\nacts that the State alone, as the juridical sovereign, can carry out. Thus, in I Congreso\nInternational Arbitration Claims against the State 373\n8 eg International Law Commission, \u0091Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for\nInternationally Wrongful Acts\u0092 Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of Its\nFifty-Third Session, UN GAOR, 56th Sess, Supp No 10, UN Doc A\/56\/10 (2001) 43, Arts 4 and 5.\n9 R Von Hennigs, \u0091European Convention on State Immunity and Other International Aspects\nof Sovereignty Immunity\u0092 (2001) 9 Willamette J Intl L & Disp Resolution 185, 186\u00967.\n10 Trendtex Trading Corp v Central Bank of Nigeria [1977] QB 529, 557\u00968 (CA) [hereinafter\nTrendtex].

It thus depends upon whether the\nforeign State has acted in exercise of its sovereign authority, that is in public law, or like a\nprivate person, that is in private law.\nThis method of distinguishing public from private is admittedly formalistic in that it\nmakes it imperative to define the uniqueness of the State as an entity. By adopting it\nhere, my aim is not to downplay the various critiques of the distinction between public\nand private power, or to deny that sovereign acts benefit some individuals and groups\nmore than others, or to suggest that the private acts of State and non-State actors cannot\nhold great significance for the public at large.13 Nor is it suggested that every dispute\ncan be credibly classified as public or private or that the formalized distinction drawn\nhere is appropriate in all instances as a method of inquiry.14 The aim here is more\nmodest. It is to show as clearly as possible that the establishment of international arbi-\ntration as an adjudicative mechanism to resolve regulatory disputes between States and\nprivate parties is a significant departure from the conventional use of international arbi-\ntration in the commercial sphere. As Feldthusen has commented, the value of cate-\ngories is \u0091less in their logic than their utility\u0092.15\nIn particular, I apply the public\u0096private distinction to differentiate the use of inter-\nnational arbitration to resolve investor-State disputes under investment treaties (invest-\nment treaty arbitration) from its use to resolve investor-State disputes pursuant to\ninvestment contracts (international commercial arbitration). The former, it is argued, is\na form of public law adjudication; the latter, a reciprocally consensual method of\ndispute resolution that can be approached generally as private law. I distinguish these\ntwo forms of arbitration by examining, in particular, two types of acts that are carried\nout by the State in any arbitration involving a claim by a private party against the State.\nThese are: (1) the State\u0092s act of consent to the compulsory jurisdiction of arbitrators as\nan alternative to the courts; and (2) the State\u0092s act that triggers a dispute with the party\nbringing the claim. I argue that, where both of these acts are uniquely sovereign in\nnature\u0097as is nearly always the case in investment treaty arbitration\u0097the arbitration is\nbest approached as public law. In contrast, where both of these acts of the State could\nbe carried out by a private party, the arbitration is appropriately classified as private\nlaw.\n374 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n12 I Congreso del Partido [1983] 1 AC 244, 267 (HL), citing Claim against the Empire of Iran\n(1963), 45 ILR 57, 80 (Ger Fed Const Ct). See also Republic of Argentina v Weltover, 504 US\n607, 613\u009614 (1992).\n13 See Freeman (n 2) 547\u00969; A Claire Cutler, \u0091Critical Reflections on the Westphalian\nAssumptions of International Law and Organization: A Crisis of Legitimacy\u0092 (2001) 27 Rev of\nInt\u0092l Studies 133, 138; D Mullan and A Ceddia, \u0091The Impact on Public Law of Privatization,\nDeregulation, Outsourcing, and Downsizing: A Canadian Perspective\u0092 (2003) 10 Indiana J Global\nLegal Studies 199, 245.\n14 C Harlow, \u0091\u0093Public\u0094 and \u0093Private\u0094 Law: Definition Without Distinction\u0092 (1980) 43 MLR 241.\n15 B Feldthusen, \u0091The Recovery of Pure Economic Loss in Canada: Proximity, Justice,\nRationality and Chaos\u0092 (1996) 24 Manitoba LJ 1, 2.\nThis analytical framework is used in this article to demonstrate that the advent of\ninvestment treaty arbitration is a major development in both public law and interna-\ntional law, and that its importance would be underestimated were it collapsed into a\nwider debate about the emergence of transnational law or the commonalities in public\nand private values.16 Indeed, the proclivity of some commentators to overlook the\nuniqueness of the sovereign as a juridical entity17 tends to mask the importance of this\nemerging system as a rare expression of public law on the international plane.18 Of\ncourse, with black and white there is always grey. Thus, after presenting the argument\nin Section III that investment treaty arbitration is a form of public law adjudication, the\ndiscussion turns in Section IV to two cases in which the public\u0096private distinction\nbecomes blurred. The first is where a \u0091stabilization clause\u0092 in a contract allows an arbi-\ntration tribunal to find that a modification of a State\u0092s regulatory regime is a breach of\ncontract; the second, where an \u0091umbrella clause\u0092 in an investment treaty permits a\ntribunal to characterize a breach of contract by the State as a violation of the treaty. In\nthe case of a stabilization clause, the State consents in a contract to resolve regulatory\ndisputes arising from activity that is clearly sovereign in character; in the case of an\numbrella clause, the State\u0092s treaty-based (ie sovereign) consent may be read to autho-\nrize the arbitration of disputes arising from an alleged breach of contract by the State.\nIn each case, therefore, both of the relevant acts of the State\u0097the act of consent and\nthe act triggering the dispute\u0097do not fall within either the sovereign or the commer-\ncial realm of State activity.\nB. Juridical Sovereignty and the Adjudication of Regulatory Disputes\nGlobalization has provoked a great deal of debate about sovereignty. Yet, partici-\npants in the debate sometimes refer to the decline of sovereignty without accounting\nfor different meanings of the term.19 If one speaks of sovereignty only as the power\nof a State to control the destiny of its people and territory, then sovereignty has no\ndoubt diminished for most if not all States through forces of globalization.20 But is\nthis anything new? In a society of States, the ability of any one State to effect its will\nover others, or over non-State actors, will vary over time. On the other hand, if one\nspeaks of sovereignty as a juridical concept then rumours of the end of sovereignty\nare exaggerated.21 Globalization has changed how power is distributed among States\nand the degree to which States can control the activities of individuals and \nInternational Arbitration Claims against the State 375\n16 Teubner (1997) (n 4) 7; D Oliver, Common Values and the Public\u0096Private Divide\n(Butterworths, London, 1999) 1\u00962.\n17 eg CN Brower, CH Brower II, and JK Sharpe, \u0091The Coming Crisis in the Global\nAdjudicative System\u0092 (2003) 19 Arbitration Intl 415, 415 (characterizing all investment disputes\nas commercial disputes).\n18 G Van Harten and M Loughlin, \u0091Investment Treaty Arbitration as a Species of Global\nAdministrative Law\u0092 (2006) 17 EJIL 121, 122.\n19 BR Roland, \u0091The Access of Individuals to International Trade Dispute Settlement\u0092 (1996)\n13 J Intl Arb 143, 146 (arguing that \u0091[T]he foremost goal of trade law is to surmount outdated\nprinciples of State sovereignty for the sake of individual welfare\u0092); Cutler (n 13) 134\u00967.\n20 R Jackson, \u0091Sovereignty in World Politics: a Glance at the Conceptual and Historical\nLandscape\u0092 (1999) 47 Pol Studies 431, 453.\n21 R Palan, \u0091Trying to Have Your Cake and Eating It: How and Why the State System Has\nCreated Offshore\u0092 (1998) 42 Intl Studies Q 625, 630; G Sorensen, \u0091Sovereignty: Change and\nContinuity in a Fundamental Institution\u0092 (1999) 47 Pol Studies 590, 604.\norganizations, but it has not seriously challenged the concept of juridical sover-\neignty.22\nIn the juridical sense, sovereignty is a conceptual framework for understanding the\nrepresentative relationship between the State and individuals within its territory, and as\nsuch for organizing the public sphere.23 Sovereignty means that the State is treated as\nthe entity that represents a group of people in relation to each other and in relation to\nother States. Sovereignty is a matter of authority, not control.24 As an ideal, sover-\neignty implies external autonomy and internal control on the part of the State, but\nneither fully exists in reality. Rather, sovereignty is a means to conceptualize how\npeople are organized into political entities and legal persons. In particular, as the repre-\nsentative of a defined political group, the State has rights and duties that can be exer-\ncised only in the State\u0092s representative capacity; that is, only on behalf of the political\ngroup.25 So long as there are States endowed with the authority to conclude treaties,\npass legislation, impose taxes, define and assign property rights, enforce judgments,\nassume public debt, and so on, then juridical sovereignty remains essential in the orga-\nnization of international society and economy.26\nA particular class of disputes may arise between the State and individuals who are\nsubject to the exercise of public authority by the State.

More importantly, regulatory\ndisputes can also be distinguished from \u0091private\u0092 disputes that arise between individuals\nacting in a private capacity (although the relationship between those individuals may\nitself be subject to State regulation).27 Thus, in international commercial arbitration, a\nparty\u0092s consent to arbitrate takes place within the private sphere not because the consent\nis irrelevant to the public in general but because the disputing parties\u0097acting in a\nprivate capacity\u0097have agreed to use a particular method of dispute resolution in\ndisputes arising between themselves.28 They have agreed, in a manner endorsed by the\n376 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n22 I Wallerstein, \u0091States?

In contrast, the submission of governmental decisions to review by a\nparticular adjudicative process is a policy choice by the State to use that method of\nadjudication as part of the governing apparatus.29 Public law adjudication is distinct\nfrom reciprocally consensual adjudication in the private sphere because the State acts\nin a sovereign capacity when it consents to the adjudication and because the relevant\ndispute arises from the exercise of sovereign authority by the State. I discuss this in\nmore detail below.\nIII. THE ADVENT OF INVESTMENT TREATY ARBITRATION\nContemporary investment treaties establish a novel international adjudicative regime that\nregulates States in order to protect the assets of foreign investors (typically, multinational\nfirms) from various forms regulation by States in whose territory such assets are\nlocated.30 Through hundreds of treaties concluded from the late 1960s, and above all in\nthe 1990s,31 investors have been given the ability to bring internationally enforceable\ndamages claims in relation to future disputes arising from sovereign (as opposed to\nmerely commercial) acts of the State, generally without the duty to exhaust local reme-\ndies.32 This is a major reform given that in customary international law individuals had\nno such right and, to the extent that States historically provide a comparable treaty-based\nright to individuals, it was limited to disputes arising from a specific historical event such\nas a war or revolution.33 Under the contemporary investment treaties, States give arbitra-\ntors a comprehensive (or generalized) jurisdiction34 to resolve individual claims beyond\nthe broad supervisory authority of domestic courts. The advent of investment treaty arbi-\ntration is thus unique because it entails a prospective consent by States to the compulsory\ninternational arbitration of disputes with investors in the regulatory sphere.\nMore important for present purposes is that States have incorporated a private\nmodel of adjudication\u0097originally designed for the resolution of international commer-\ncial disputes\u0097into the procedural design and enforcement structure of investment\ntreaties. As a result, investment treaty arbitration is frequently analogized to interna-\ntional commercial arbitration.35 The two forms of arbitration are similar in that both\nInternational Arbitration Claims against the State 377\n29 M Damas\u00f9ka, \u0091Activism in Perspective\u0092 (1983) 92 Yale LJ 1189, 1191\u00962; Loughlin (n 23) 5\nand 12.\n30 See UNCTAD, World Investment Report 2003 (United Nations, New York, 2003) c IV.\n31 Including both bilateral investment treaties and regional agreements that contain provisions\non compulsory investment arbitration.

See also SJ Toope, Mixed International Arbitration\u0097Studies in Arbitration\nallow a private party to bring a claim before a tribunal, the members of which are\nappointed by the disputing parties rather than a public authority.36 Also, the proceed-\nings are governed by rules originating in private arbitration,37 and the professional\nbackgrounds of many arbitrators are in the area of commercial law. Further, the main\nremedy is a damages award that is enforceable under the New York Convention and\nother instruments of international commercial arbitration.38 Finally, rules of arbitration\nand domestic laws typically call for courts to show deference to arbitration awards in\norder to promote stability and predictability in the use of arbitration in international\ncommerce. Even so, in spite of these commonalities the analogy between investment\ntreaty arbitration and commercial arbitration confuses form with substance. As\ndiscussed in the next section, in investment treaty arbitration both the State\u0092s consent\nto arbitration as well as the act of the State that triggers a claim by a private party are\npredominantly sovereign in nature, whereas in commercial arbitration they are private\nor commercial.\nA. The Sovereign Character of Investment Treaty Arbitration39\nThe authority for international commercial arbitration is private in that it stems from\nthe autonomy of individuals to order their affairs as they wish. Thus, although a State\ncan consent in a contract to the arbitration of disputes that arise from a relationship with\nanother private party, so too can any private individual. Also, like any individual a\nState can also enter into and breach a commercial agreement with another private party.\nIn both circumstances, the law deems the State to have shed the cloak of sovereignty\nand descended into the commercial sphere.40 In the words of Lord Denning in\nTrendtex: \u0091If a government department goes into the market places of the world and\nbuys boots or cement\u0097as a commercial transaction\u0097that government should be\nsubject to all the rules of the marketplace\u0092.41 The fundamentally unequal relationship\nbetween juridical sovereign and private individual is thus transformed into a relation-\nship in which both parties are capable of possessing the same legal rights and duties.\nIn turn, an arbitration arising from this relationship can be understood as private\nbecause its authority derives from the consents of the disputing parties, mutually given\nin the context of a reciprocal relationship between juridical equals, both acting in a\nprivate capacity.\nCompare this with the State\u0092s participation as juridical sovereign in an international\narbitration. Under investment treaties, the authority for the arbitration of claims against\n378 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nBetween States and Private Persons (Grotius Publications, Cambridge, 1990) 389 (noting the\ntendency to approach investment arbitration \u0091purely as a subcategory of international commercial\narbitration and thus infused with the values of that process\u0092).\n36 The presiding arbitrator is normally appointed, in the absence of agreement between the\ndisputing parties, by a designated appointing authority.\n37 eg ICSID, Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, rev 26 Sept 1984 and 1 Jan 2003\n(original rules 1968), reprinted in Convention, Regulations and Rules (ICSID, Washington, 2003)\n93; Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, UNGA Res\n31\/98, UN GAOR, 31st Session, Supp No 17, UN Doc A\/31\/17, c V, s C (1976); and Rules of\nArbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, rev 1 Jan 1998 (original rules 1922), online:\nInternational Chamber of Commerce <http:\/\/www.iccwbo.org\/court\/english\/arbitration\/rules.asp>.\n38 New York Convention (n 5).\n39 For a more detailed discussion, see Van Harten and Loughlin (n 18) 139\u009645.\n40 eg Congreso del Partido (n 12). 41 Trendtex (n 10) 558.\nthe State comes from the agreement of the State parties to the treaty to permit the use\nof adjudication to resolve disputes arising from their exercise of sovereign authority\nover each other\u0092s nationals.42 When a State agrees by treaty to the arbitration of invest-\nment disputes in general, the State acts in a uniquely sovereign capacity. The consent\nis not limited, as in commercial arbitration, to an existing dispute that is known in\nadvance to the consenting party or to disputes arising from a particular relationship\nbetween juridical equals. Rather, the State is unilaterally exposed to claims by a broad\nclass of potential claimants in relation to governmental acts that affect the assets of\nforeign investors. The disputes that lead to individual claims under investment treaties\ntypically arise from acts that entail the exercise of authority that is unique to the State,\nsuch as the passage of legislation, the adoption of mandatory regulations, or the\nissuance of judicial decisions.43 The \u0091general consent\u0092 is uniquely sovereign, therefore,\nbecause it is a prospective consent to the compulsory arbitration of regulatory disputes\nwith investors as a group.44\nIn light of the general consent, investment treaties give arbitrators a comprehensive\njurisdiction to resolve a broad class of disputes arising from sovereign acts of the State,\ninstead of a contract-specific competence to resolve disputes arising from a specific\ncommercial relationship. But this does not itself pose a challenge to juridical sover-\neignty, however much it may reduce the ability of States to control the activities of\nmultinational firms. By acting on the general consent a tribunal exercises authority that\nis delegated by States; only the State can grant to an individual the authority to adjudi-\ncate a regulatory dispute within its territory.45 This authority to delegate is inherently\nsovereign because it stems from the representative status of the State in relation to the\npopulation and political group that is associated with its territory.46 As such, juridical\nsovereignty remains fundamental to the establishment of any treaty-based adjudicative\nregime. Further, an arbitrator who is given comprehensive jurisdiction over a claim\nfiled under an investment treaty is as much an official of the State as judges who are\nappointed for life by a government or directly elected by voters.

The Investor\u0092s Consent\nThe discussion thus far has focused on the sovereign character of the State\u0092s consent in\nan investment treaty. However, some commentators look to the investor\u0092s consent in\norder to position investment treaty arbitration within the private sphere.47 They do so\nby linking the investor\u0092s consent to the treaty consent of the respondent State, in order\nto establish a classical \u0091agreement to arbitrate\u0092 as understood in commercial arbitration.\nThis conceptual approach is critically analysed here.\nWhen an investor consents to the arbitration of a dispute with a State under a treaty,\nacting on the \u0091standing offer\u0092 made by the State\u0092s general consent, the investor invokes\na governing arrangement that was originally established by an agreement between\nStates. The investor\u0092s consent is an acceptance of a remedial opportunity provided by\nStates to a particular class of individuals. In particular, the investor seizes an opportu-\nnity to seek damages for a State\u0092s alleged breach of international standards that regu-\nlate States. This opportunity is made available by an inter-State bargain, not a private\nagreement, and it relates to regulatory rather than commercial disputes. As such, the\ninvestor\u0092s consent in investment treaty arbitration differs from the consent of a private\nparty in commercial arbitration.\nTo elaborate, under an investment treaty an investor must choose whether to resort\nto arbitration only after the relevant dispute has arisen. The investor\u0092s consent is retro-\nspective, ie it is specific to disputes arising from the regulatory relationship with a\nState.48 Unlike the respondent State, the investor does not commit to the compulsory\narbitration of any future dispute with the State, at the instance of the State. Tribunals\nare not given general jurisdiction to award damages against investors for violations of\nstandards that regulate businesses or protect the interests of host States. Generally\nspeaking, it is States that are sanctioned and investors that are compensated.49 Indeed,\nfor a foreign investor to be sanctioned via compulsory international arbitration in the\ncontext of a regulatory dispute would require the consent of the investor\u0092s home State,\nnot the investor.50 In investment treaty arbitration, the investor\u0092s consent is always\nspecific, just as the State\u0092s consent is always general.\nIn short, an investor\u0092s decision to submit a dispute to investment treaty arbitration\nis more like the decision of an individual to seek damages against the State under\n380 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n47 eg C Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (CUP, Cambridge, 2001) 233; Z\nDouglas, \u0091The Hybrid Foundations of Investment Treaty Arbitration\u0092 (2003) 74 BYIL 151, 221\u00962\nand 237.\n48 The investor\u0092s consent is akin to a party\u0092s entry into an agreement to arbitrate\u0097or compro-\nmis\u0097after the dispute has arisen. \n49 This is \u0091generally speaking\u0092 only because some investment treaties allow counter-claims by\nthe respondent State after an investor has made a claim under the treaty although in all cases it is\nthe investor who triggers the use of the system.\n50 Such as in the case of the International Criminal Court whose jurisdiction is limited (but\nfor cases referred to the court by the UN Security Council) to acts of individuals that were\ncommitted either within the territory of a State Party or by a national of a State Party: Rome\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, 17 July 1998, 37 ILM 999 (entered into force 1 July\n2002) Art 12(2).\ndomestic public law than the decision to seek damages against another individual in\nprivate law. It is a consent of privilege rather than reciprocal obligation. This does not\nmake the investor\u0092s consent insignificant. Depending on the terms of the relevant\ntreaty, the investor\u0092s submission of a dispute to treaty arbitration can have important\nlegal ramifications. It may require the investor to relinquish rights under domestic law.\nBut these conditions of access to the system are based not on an agreement made by\nthe investor but on a regime established by States.\nIV. GREY AREAS IN THE PUBLIC\u0096PRIVATE DIVIDE\nThe analysis presented above follows from the principle that some forms of authority\nare unique to the juridical entity of the State. This principle has informed my exami-\nnation of the two types of State acts that are relevant to the international arbitration of\nindividual claims against States. But it would be foolhardy to suggest that the distinc-\ntion between public and private is always clear-cut. In this section, I review two forms\nof international arbitration which straddle the public\u0096private divide. The first involves\nthe use of contract-based arbitration to resolve regulatory disputes arising from sover-\neign acts of the State, while the second involves the treaty-based arbitration of contrac-\ntual disputes arising from commercial acts of the State. Both reveal exceptional aspects\nof the relationship between international arbitration and the retreat of the State. On the\nother hand, this discussion should not be taken as an abandonment of the view that\ninvestment treaty arbitration is a form of public law adjudication, or that the signifi-\ncance of investment treaties lies in their delegation of the judicial function in public law\nto private arbitrators.\nA. Contract-Based Arbitration of Regulatory Disputes\nAs discussed earlier, when a State consents by contract to the compulsory international\narbitration of disputes arising from a contract, the State acts in a private capacity. This\nremains the case when a contract between a private party and a State entity\u0097concern-\ning an investment by the private party in the State\u0092s territory\u0097contains an arbitration\nclause. The contract is an investment agreement and the arbitration of disputes arising\nfrom the agreement is contract-based investment arbitration, broadly analogous to\ninternational commercial arbitration, because the acts of the State giving rise to the\ndispute as well as the specific nature of the State\u0092s consent are both private acts. On\nthis basis, contract-based investment arbitration is distinguishable from public law\nadjudication.\nYet, some investment contracts put obligations on the State Party to the contract\nthat are clearly binding on the State (and only the State) in its sovereign capacity. This\nis the case where a contract contains a \u0091stabilization clause\u0092 that purports to obligate\nthe State to maintain, for a long-term period, the regulatory framework that applies to\nthe investment at the time the investment is made.51 Stabilization clauses have an\nestablished history and are widespread in the context of North\u0096South investment flows.\nThus, for instance, the exploration and development of oil in Chad, which in 2003\nbegan to pump crude for export through Cameroon, is based on a series of long-term\nInternational Arbitration Claims against the State 381\n51 W Peter, Arbitration and Renegotiation of International Investment Agreements (Kluwer\nLaw International, The Hague, 1995) 136\u009642.\ncontracts between Chad and an international oil consortium led by Exxon Mobil.52\nEach of these contracts contains a stabilization clause, exemplified by Article 34.3 of\nthe 2004 agreement between Chad and the consortium:53\nDuring the period of validity of this document, the State shall ensure that it shall not apply\nto the Consortium, without prior agreement of the Parties, any future governmental acts\nwith the duly established effect of aggravating, directly, as a consequence, or due to their\napplication to the shareholders of the Consortium, the obligations and charges imposed by\nthe provisions of this Convention or with the effect of undermining the rights and economic\nadvantages of the Consortium or its shareholders . . . Only the Consortium shall be able to\ncite this stability clause, which is offered to it to the exclusion of any third party to this\nConvention . . .\nAny of the corporate members of the oil consortium may resort to compulsory arbitra-\ntion, pursuant to the contract, should it conclude that its rights under the stabilization\nclause were adversely affected by regulatory reforms adopted by Chad, whether based\non new or existing laws.\nThe stabilization clause thus restricts the policy options available to Chad\u0092s\nGovernment, and to the people represented by the State of Chad, in relation to the oil\nproject for a substantial period (at least 30 years in this case). The clause does so to\nsafeguard the anticipated returns of the oil consortium, once its initial costs are sunk,\nfrom the possibility that a future government might seek to increase the State\u0092s share\nof the revenues generated by the project. On the other hand, such clauses are open to\nthe criticism that the current government\u0097in this case, with advice and financing from\nthe World Bank\u0097sacrificed too much on the altar of economic development. Thus,\nAmnesty International has campaigned against the stabilization clauses accepted by\nChad in this case on the basis that they could frustrate the protection of human rights\nin the country.54 And so they could, but only as part of a wider bargain to gain access\nto the technology, know-how, and other resources of multinational firms.55 Chad has\ntraded away some of its policy options in exchange for private investment in its oil\nsector.\nThe wisdom of Chad\u0092s acceptance of these stabilization clauses is an important\nquestion, although not for our present purpose. The more narrow concern here is with\nwhether this particular use of international arbitration to constrain the State, based on\na contract, is a matter of public or private law. Two questions are pertinent. The first is\nwhether the acts of Chad that are bound by the stabilization clause, whether tied to the\nprotection of human rights or other governmental imperatives, exist only if one accepts\nthe principle of juridical sovereignty. The answer, quite clearly, is yes. The clause\nrefers to \u0091governmental acts\u0092. It applies to the passage of any law or regulation, though\ngeneral in its application, which detrimentally affects the \u0091rights and economic advan-\ntages\u0092 of the private contracting parties. It is one-sided in that it only binds the contract-\ning State. It is a legal mechanism to secure the economic interests of an international\ncombine against the danger posed by the right of a self-governing people to determine\ntheir future. Juridical sovereignty in this respect serves as the framework by which the\npopulation of a territory can bind itself so as to enhance the security of foreign capital.\n382 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n52 See Amnesty International, \u0091Contracting out of Human Rights: The Chad\u0096Cameroon\npipeline project\u0092 (London, Sept 2005).\n53 Reproduced in ibid 46, n 67.\n54 ibid 28\u009633.\n55 Peter (n 51) 11\u009612.\nIt provides the conceptual foundation for the contractual constraint of sovereign acts of\na State.56\nThis leads to the second question: whether Chad\u0092s consent to the compulsory arbi-\ntration of disputes arising from such acts, where they affect the rights and interests of\nmembers of the oil consortium, is also a sovereign act. Put differently, can a State\u0097\nacting in a private capacity\u0097constrain its regulatory conduct over the long term by\nagreeing to a contract and, in particular, to a compulsory arbitration clause? The answer\nmight be no if one concluded that, in principle, the character of any act of consent can\nbe defined only by examining the nature of the acts that are bound by the consent. That\nis, inherent to a State\u0092s consent in a private capacity is the assumption that the State can\nonly bind itself in relation to acts that a private party could carry out. By consenting in\na contract to the compulsory arbitration of disputes arising from the contract, therefore,\na State acts in a private capacity only to the extent that the relevant disputes themselves\narise from private acts of the State. Were the State to bind itself with respect to sover-\neign conduct, then the consent itself must also be viewed as a sovereign act given that\nno private party could refrain from amending legislation, introducing new regulations,\netc. Based on this line of reasoning, the mere fact that the authority for an arbitration\nstems from an agreement to arbitrate in a contract, does not itself constitute the arbi-\ntration as commercial arbitration. One needs to look more closely at the acts that are\npurportedly bound in order to ascertain whether the contract-based consent is in fact a\ncommercial act.\nThis reasoning is attractive in principle, but it poses a practical problem for the\nfacilitation of international commerce between private parties and States. The diffi-\nculty is that if States are deemed to be unable to commit, by contract, to refrain from\nregulatory \u0091interference\u0092 with the rights and interests of private parties, they would be\ndeprived of a legal vehicle for the promotion of their own development, particularly\nin the resource sector, by entering into long-term concessions with foreign firms.\nMore to the point, international business would face greater risk when entering into\ntransactions with State entities, thus increasing the cost of resource exploitation in\nmuch of the world. These considerations have led courts and arbitrators to adopt vari-\nous mechanisms to enforce contracts that bind sovereign acts of a State party, includ-\ning the restrictive doctrine of sovereign immunity; the reading of a contractual consent\nby a State to compulsory arbitration as an implied waiver of immunity; and (ambi-\ntiously) the characterization of international arbitration itself as a special adjudicative\nregime that exists \u0091beyond\u0092 the domestic sphere and is thus exempt from claims of\nsovereign immunity.57 What these mechanisms have in common is a tendency to\nunderstate the sovereign nature of the State conduct that is bound by a contract-based\nconsent to arbitration. Each also undergirds the use of contract-based arbitration as an\ninternational governing arrangement aimed at regulating States (mainly in the devel-\noping world) in support of international commerce and the business security of multi-\nnational firms.\nInternational Arbitration Claims against the State 383\n56 J McLean, \u0091Government to State: Globalization, Regulation, and Governments as Legal\nPersons\u0092 (2003) 10 Indiana J Global Legal Stud 173.\n57 See generally RY Jennings, \u0091State Contracts in International Law\u0092 (1961) 37 BYIL 156,\n177\u00968; J-F Lalive, \u0091Contracts Between a State or a State Agency and a Foreign Company\u0092 (1964)\n18 ICLQ 987, 1008\u009611.\nThus, in rejecting pleas of sovereign immunity by States as a bar to the jurisdiction\nof commercial arbitration tribunals over disputes arising from sovereign acts of the\nState, Wetter argues:58\nAcceptance of the plea would militate against one of the most fundamental notions of the\ninternational arbitral process . . . Innumerable, carefully balanced agreements are extant in\nthe entire world to which states and state entities are parties and in which an equilibrium\non the procedural level has been achieved principally by the contractual creation of mutu-\nally binding arbitration provisions. No international tribunal could deny and render nuga-\ntory the existence and effectiveness of the ultimately determinative adjudicatory element\nof such an immense, complex and important network of financial, trade and investment\ncontracts, created by the desires of states and private parties in response to the needs of\ninternational commerce.\nThis is essentially a policy argument. The claim is that the extensive participation by\nStates in international commerce requires arbitrators to give effect to contract-based\nconsents of States, even where the consent purports to bind the sovereign conduct of\nthe State. It may thus be seen as a decision to bridge the public\u0096private divide in a way\nthat constitutes commercial arbitration as an appendage of an international governing\napparatus.\nB. The Texaco Arbitration\nA classic example of this use of contract-based arbitration to bind sovereign acts of the\nState is the award in the Texaco arbitration of 1977,59 in which the French academic\nRen\u00e9-Jean Dupuy ordered Libya to perform specifically its obligations under a 50-year\noil concession agreement dating from 1955, based on this stabilization clause:\nThe Government of Libya will take all steps necessary to ensure that the company enjoys\nall the rights conferred by this concession. The contractual rights expressly created by this\nconcession shall not be altered except by mutual consent of the parties.\nThis Concession shall throughout the period of its validity be construed in accordance\nwith the Petroleum Law and the Regulations in force on the date of execution of the agree-\nment of amendment by which this paragraph (2) was incorporated into the concession\nagreement. Any amendment to or repeal of such Regulations shall not affect the contrac-\ntual rights of the Company without its consent.\nFollowing Colonel Qadhafi\u0092s overthrow of Libya\u0092s Western-backed monarchy in\n1969, Libya adopted a more aggressive bargaining stance toward foreign oil compa-\nnies.60 By 1973\u009674, this led to the enactment of decrees nationalizing the rights, inter-\nests and property of Texaco Overseas Petroleum and the California Asiatic Oil\nCompany as granted under the oil concession of 1955. Based on the dispute settlement\nprovisions of the concession agreement, the oil companies resorted to international\narbitration, in which the Qadhafi Government refused to participate. Proceeding under\nthe contract, the President of the International Court of Justice appointed Mr Dupuy as\nsole arbitrator. In the course of interpreting the concession agreement, Dupuy exam-\nined the applicability of its stabilization clause to Libya\u0092s acts of nationalization:61\n384 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n58 JG Wetter, \u0091Pleas of Sovereign Immunity and Act of Sovereignty before International\nArbitral Tribunals\u0092 (1985) 2 J Intl Arbitration 7, 14\u009615.\n59 Texaco Overseas Petroleum Co & California Asiatic Oil Co v Government of the Libyan\nArab Republic (Merits) (19 Jan 1977), 17 ILM 4 [hereinafter Texaco].\n60 R First, Libya\u0097The Elusive Revolution (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1974) c 10.\n61 Texaco (n 59) paras 70\u00961.\nThe Deeds of Concession entered into by the parties do not include any provision by which\nthe Libyan Government limited its recourse to nationalization. However, Clause 16 of the\nDeeds of Concession contains a stabilization clause with respect to the rights of the conces-\nsion holder . . .\nSuch a provision, the effect of which is to stabilize the position of the contracting\nparty, does not, in principle, impair the sovereignty of the Libyan State. Not only has the\nLibyan State freely undertaken commitments but also the fact that this clause stabilizes\nthe petroleum legislation and regulations as of the date of the execution of the agreement\ndoes not affect in principle the legislative and regulatory sovereignty of Libya. Libya\nreserves all its prerogatives to issue laws and regulations in the field of petroleum activ-\nities in respect of national or foreign persons with which it has not undertaken such a\ncommitment. Clause 16 only makes such acts invalid as far as contracting parties are\nconcerned\u0097with respect to whom this commitment has been undertaken\u0097during the\nperiod of applicability of the Deeds of Concession.\nAs such, it was concluded that an earlier Libyan government could validly undertake\ncontractual obligations that bound sovereign acts of Libya for the long term, including in\nparticular the acts of nationalization taken by the post-revolutionary government. In addi-\ntion, Dupuy took the additional step of justifying the imposition of this contract-based\nconstraint on Libya\u0092s sovereign conduct by characterizing the concessionary agreement\nas an \u0091internationalized\u0092 agreement, ie as a special type of contract that is separated\nfrom the domestic law of any State.62 He concluded:63\nThus, in respect of the international law of contracts, a nationalization cannot prevail\nover an internationalized contract, containing stabilization clauses, entered into between\na State and foreign private company. The situation could be different only if one were to\nconclude that the exercise by a State of its right to nationalize places that State on a level\noutside of and superior to the contract and also to the international legal order itself, and\nconstitutes an \u0091act of government\u0092 which is beyond the scope of any judicial redress or\nany criticism.\nDupuy\u0092s interpretation of the contract can be summarized in this way: the long-term\nconcession entered into by Libya, because it contained both a stabilization clause and\nan arbitration clause, was an internationalized agreement that authorized arbitrators to\nrule on the legality of Libya\u0092s nationalization, regardless of its domestic law. Based on\nthis finding, Dupuy ordered specific performance by Libya in favour of the oil compa-\nnies, which later settled for monetary compensation.\nDupuy\u0092s decision was no doubt motivated by the same considerations that underlie\nthe stabilization clauses entered into by Chad; that is, it puts aside sovereign preroga-\ntives in order to facilitate the State\u0092s participation in international commerce and, in\nparticular, to provide a stable legal framework for international business. One can\napply various criticisms to this justification, in addition to the human rights critique of\nAmnesty International. For example, the policy only follows from the assumption of a\ncapitalist global economy in which capital flows are organized, technology transferred,\nInternational Arbitration Claims against the State 385\n62 R Lillich, \u0091The Law Governing Disputes Under Economic Development Agreements:\nReexamining the Concept of \u0093Internationalization\u0094\u0092 in R Lillich and CN Brower (eds),\nInternational Arbitration in the 21st Century (Transnational Publishers, New York, 1994) 68\u00969.\nFor a contrary view see, eg, Bowett, \u0091State Contracts With Aliens\u0092 (1988) 59 BYIL 49.\n63 Texaco (n 59) para 73.

Alternatively, as argued\nby Asante and Sornarajah, long-term concessions that impact on fundamental aspects\nof a State\u0092s economy could be characterized as public law instruments.65 From this\npoint of view, the economic uncertainty underlying such long-term contracts means\nthat a degree of conflict between investor and government is bound to arise, and that it\nshould be managed by structured renegotiation rather than private law adjudication.\nRejecting this approach to State contracts in Texaco,66 Dupuy prioritized the binding\nnature of a State\u0092s contractual obligations over the special considerations that flow\nfrom the uniqueness of the State as juridical entity.67\nEven so, the impact of the Texaco award on Libya\u0092s freedom of governmental\naction does not in itself amount to a full-scale retreat of the State because the frame-\nwork of juridical sovereignty remains intact. If one restricts the meaning of sovereignty\nto that of formal status rather than actual power, then Dupuy\u0092s interpretation of the\nstabilization clause, as he noted, \u0091does not affect in principle the legislative and regu-\nlatory sovereignty of Libya\u0092. Closer to the mark for our purposes is Dupuy\u0092s construc-\ntion of an \u0091international legal order\u0092 based on the theory of internationalized contracts.\nIn the case of either finding, to maintain the reciprocity of the private law relationship\nthe underlying theory of the decision either equates the juridical position of the sover-\neign to that of a private party, or it elevates private firms to a formal sovereign status\nalongside the State.68 Neither is very satisfying in its definition of the public sphere\nbased on the uniqueness of the State. But this is not the key issue. The crucial signifi-\ncance of Texaco\u0097and other arbitrations involving the interpretation of stabilization\nclauses\u0097is not so much how the grey area between public and private is resolved but\nby whom. The definition by arbitrators of the uniqueness of the State in these cases\nsupports in relation to matters of public law the wider claim that international arbitra-\ntion is part of a legal order in which private actors formulate bodies of law without\ndirect supervision by the State.\nYet, regardless of whether the priorities of the global market require the use of\ninternational commercial arbitration (rather than courts) to control juridical sover-\neigns, there is an important mitigating factor in contract-based arbitration that is\nabsent from treaty arbitration in relation to any retreat of the State from the field of\n386 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n64 Y Ghai, \u0091Management Contracts\u0092 in Y Ghai, R Luckham, and F Snyder (eds), The Political\nEconomy of Law (OUP, Dehli, 1987) 389\u009698.\n65 SKB Asante, \u0091Stability or Contractual Relations in the Transnational Investment Process\u0092\n(1979) 28 ICLQ 401, 403\u00964; M Sornarajah, The Settlement of Foreign Investment Disputes\n(Kluwer, Boston, 2001).

This is the specificity of the State\u0092s consent. As noted, in commercial\narbitration, the State decides to submit to the authority of arbitrators in the context of\na particular transaction or relationship with a private party. The consent is not gener-\nalized to a broad class of individuals who are affected by regulatory acts of the State.\nThis limits the scope of contract-based arbitration and the degree to which it impinges\non sovereign discretion, relative to a treaty-based consent that encompasses the full\nrange of the State\u0092s regulatory relations with investors as a group. Thus, while inter-\nnational commercial arbitration may engage regulatory disputes, it is less firmly\nentrenched in the public sphere than its investment treaty counterpart.\nC. Investment Treaty Arbitration of Contractual Disputes\nThe view that investment treaty arbitration is a form of public law adjudication was\noutlined above. In this section, the discussion focuses on a particular class of disputes\nthat come before tribunals established under investment treaties and that complicate the\ncharacterization of investment treaty arbitration as public law. This challenge arises, in\nparticular, where investment treaties authorize the compulsory arbitration of disputes\narising from an alleged breach of contract by the State.\nIt is important to emphasize that most contract-related claims submitted to invest-\nment treaty arbitration remain quite clearly a matter of public law. The mere fact that\nan investment treaty tribunal rules on a dispute that originates in a contract between an\ninvestor and a State entity does not alter the public character of the arbitration. This is\nbecause the obligations by which States are bound under the treaties, in their treatment\nof investors, are intertwined with the sovereign authority of the State. Further, the acts\nof the State that trigger such disputes are sovereign acts. Thus, a treaty may bind the\nState as the sovereign in relation to contracts that it has entered into as a private party.\nIn most treaty arbitrations relating to a contract, the categories of sovereign and\ncommercial are relatively easy to make out. This is illustrated by the Wena Hotels arbi-\ntration.69 In that case, the tribunal concluded that the conduct of an Egyptian State\ncompany (EHC: the Egyptian Hotels Company) that had entered into a hotel lease with\na foreign company\u0097and the delayed and inadequate response of the Egyptian author-\nities to that conduct\u0097amounted to a violation of a bilateral investment treaty between\nEgypt and the investor\u0092s home State, the UK. As the tribunal found, in the course of a\ndisagreement between EHC and the investor, EHC encouraged and took part in the\nseizure of the investor\u0092s hotels. Buildings and furniture were ruined; agents and\nemployees of the investor were roughed up. In response, the Egyptian authorities\nneglected to compel EHC to return the hotel property and compensate the investor for\nits losses. This, the tribunal concluded, violated Egypt\u0092s obligations under the treaty,\nincluding its duties to ensure fair and equitable treatment, as well as full protection and\nsecurity, for investors. On this basis, Egypt was ordered to pay (US) $20 million in\ndamages.\nThe key here is that, although the dispute originated in a contract, this arbitration\nrevolved around matters of public law. It is true that the Egyptian State, via EHC, may\nbe seen to have acted in a private capacity when it entered into a hotel lease with the\nInternational Arbitration Claims against the State 387\n69 Wena Hotels Ltd v Egypt (Merits) (8 Dec 2000), 41 ILM 896 [hereinafter Wena Hotels]. See\nalso Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA & Vivendi Universal v Argentine Republic\n(Annulment) (3 July 2002), 6 ICSID Rep 340, paras 95\u00966.\ninvestor. But the liability of Egypt itself arose not from the acts of EHC per se but from\nthe failure of the Egyptian authorities to protect the investor from abuse. According to\nthe tribunal:70\nthere is substantial evidence that Egypt was aware of EHC\u0092s intentions to seize the hotels\nand took no actions to prevent EHC from doing so. Moreover, once the seizures occurred,\nboth the police and the Ministry of Tourism took no immediate action to restore the hotels\npromptly to Wena\u0092s control. Finally, Egypt never imposed substantial sanctions on EHC or\nits senior officials, suggesting Egypt\u0092s approval of EHC\u0092s actions.\nThe duties of Egypt to protect private property, and to condemn and punish the perpe-\ntrators of harm to private individuals, are sovereign duties flowing from the State\u0092s\nmonopoly over the lawful use of force to maintain order. In the same vein, the treaty\nobligations of a State to refrain from adopting regulatory measures that discriminate\nagainst foreign investors, or to pay compensation for an expropriation of assets, are\nquintessentially sovereign. In Wena Hotels, the terms of the contract between EHC and\nthe investor were a vital factual element in the dispute. But Egypt\u0092s consent to arbitrate\nremained a sovereign act just as Egypt\u0092s failure to adequately protect the investor in its\ndispute with ECH followed from Egypt\u0092s unique status as the sovereign.\nThat said, there is a distinct class of investment treaty arbitrations in which the\ndispute itself arises directly from an alleged breach of contract by the State. They\ninvolve claims by investors pursuant to \u0091umbrella clauses\u0092 contained in investment\ntreaties.71 Many investment treaties contain such clauses, which typically provide for\nthe States Parties to \u0091respect\u0092 or \u0091observe\u0092 or \u0091abide by\u0092 all of their obligations and\ncommitments to foreign investors.72 A broad reading of such clauses is that they estab-\nlish a general, overarching guarantee on the part of the State to any foreign investor that\nhas entered into a specific agreement with the State. On this interpretation, an umbrella\nclause transforms a breach of contract by the State into an outright violation of the\ntreaty.73\nUmbrella clauses put investment treaties into a potentially precarious position rela-\ntive to domestic legal orders because they provide an additional avenue by which\nprivate parties can seek redress for alleged breaches of contract by a State. Since the\numbrella clause is subject to dispute settlement under the treaty it may enable an\ninvestor to bring a treaty claim alongside the causes of action available under the\ncontract. A treaty claim based on an umbrella clause may supplement contractual (or\nother domestic) remedies. Besides certain complications that this creates for invest-\nment treaty provisions regarding the customary duty of foreign nationals to exhaust\nlocal remedies before bringing an international claim, umbrella clauses introduce a\ngrey area in the classification of arbitration as public law. That is, is investment treaty\narbitration really a form of public law adjudication, one may ask, where the dispute has\narisen from an alleged breach of contract by the State but the State\u0092s consent to arbi-\ntrate is contained in a treaty? Or does the fact that the dispute originates in a commer-\ncial act of the State make this category of treaty arbitration a matter of private law?\n388 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n70 Wena Hotels, ibid para 84. 71 UNCTAD (n 65) 19\u009623.\n72 AC Sinclair, \u0091The Origins of the Umbrella Clause in the International Law of Investment\nProtection\u0092 (2004) 20 Arbitration Intl 411, 412\u009613.\n73 J Karl, \u0091The Promotion and Protection of German Foreign Investment Abroad\u0092 (1996) 11\nICSID Rev\u0097FILJ 1, 23; C Schreuer, \u0091Travelling the BIT route: of waiting periods, umbrella\nclauses and forks in the road\u0092 (2004) 5 J World Investment and Trade 231, 250; FO Vicu\u00f1a, \u0091Of\nContracts and Treaties in the Global Market\u0092 (2004) 8 Max Planck Ybk UN Law 341.\nD. The SGS Arbitrations\nThese questions were relevant to two arbitrations against Pakistan and the Philippines,\nrespectively, under separate investment treaties, initiated by the same Swiss investor,\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA (SGS).74 In both cases, the State\u0092s treaty-based\nconsent to the jurisdiction of the tribunal and to the umbrella clause in the treaty was a\nsovereign act, while the act triggering the dispute was an alleged breach of contract by\nthe State, ie a commercial act.\nIn SGS v Pakistan, SGS claimed that Pakistan had violated an umbrella clause in its\nbilateral investment treaty with Switzerland, which obliged Pakistan to \u0091constantly\nguarantee the observance\u0092 of its commitments to Swiss investors. SGS had concluded\na contract with the Government of Pakistan to provide pre-inspection services for\ncustoms control. The contractual relationship broke down, prompting an (unsuccessful)\naction by SGS in the Swiss courts, and the initiation by Pakistan of arbitration in\nPakistan in accordance with the dispute settlement clause of the contract. SGS coun-\ntered with an international claim of breach of contract pursuant to the treaty\u0092s umbrella\nclause. After assessing the claim, the tribunal in SGS v Pakistan declined to assert juris-\ndiction, finding that the wording of the umbrella clause was not sufficiently clear and\nspecific to convert Pakistan\u0092s contractual duties into treaty obligations.75 As discussed\nbelow, this reading effectively limited the potential encroachment of treaty arbitration\ninto the private sphere of contractual disputes out of respect for the integrity of the\ndomestic legal order.76\nWe may compare this to the arbitration in SGS v Philippines, in which another\ntribunal reached a very different conclusion as to whether umbrella clauses can found\nthe jurisdiction of a treaty tribunal over investor claims of breach of contract by the\nState. In this case, SGS had entered into a contract with the Government of the\nPhilippines for the provision of import supervision services. SGS claimed inter alia that\nthe Philippines breached the contract and filed a claim under a Swiss\u0096Philippines invest-\nment treaty. The treaty contained an umbrella clause that required the Philippines \u0091to\nobserve any obligation\u0092 it assumed with respect to investments of Swiss investors within\nits territory. The tribunal took note of, and rejected in strong language, the reasoning of\nthe award in SGS v Pakistan, stating that the earlier tribunal had \u0091failed to give any clear\nmeaning to the \u0093umbrella clause\u0094 \u0092 in the Swiss\u0096Pakistan treaty. The SGS v Philippines\ntribunal then concluded that the applicable umbrella clause made it a violation of the\ntreaty for the Philippines to breach a binding contractual commitment to a Swiss\ninvestor. On this basis, the tribunal assumed jurisdiction over SGS\u0092s claims of breach of\ncontract by the Philippines, although it declined to exercise that jurisdiction until after\nInternational Arbitration Claims against the State 389\n74 SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance v Pakistan (Jurisdiction) (6 Aug 2003), 18 ICSID Rev\n307, 16(2) World Trade and Arb Mat 167 [hereinafter SGS v Pakistan]; SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de\nSurveillance v Philippines (Jurisdiction) (29 Jan 2004), 16 World Trade and Arb Mat 91 [here-\ninafter SGS v Philippines].

For one, the wording of the respective umbrella clauses was\ndifferent. In SGS v Pakistan, the States Parties were obliged to \u0091constantly guarantee\nthe observance of commitments\u0092, whereas in SGS v Philippines each was required to\n\u0091observe any obligation it has assumed\u0092. The latter phrase, as noted by the SGS v\nPhilippines tribunal, is a bit more categorical.77 On the other hand, both clauses also\nraise the possibility that the State\u0092s general consent to treaty arbitration encapsulated a\nconsent to arbitrate disputes arising from breach of contract by the State.\nMore important for the present inquiry are divergences in the tribunals\u0092 characteri-\nzation of the purpose of investment treaties. In SGS v Pakistan, the tribunal expressed\nits aim to avoid a clash between what it regarded as distinct bodies of law; that is,\nbetween treaty and contract. The tribunal reasoned that umbrella clauses \u0091should be\nread in such a way as to enhance mutuality and balance of benefits in the inter-relation\nof different agreements located in differing legal orders\u0092. The danger, for the tribunal,\nwas that an expansive reading of the umbrella clause \u0091would amount to incorporating\nby reference an unlimited number of State commitments including unilateral commit-\nments to an investor of the other Contracting Party . . .\u0092.78 In showing restraint in this\nfashion, the tribunal drew on a distinction between the domestic and international\nsphere. However, given the facts, its rationale also differentiated sovereign acts from\nprivate acts of the State. In doing so, the tribunal indirectly preserved the integrity of\ntreaty arbitration as a \u0091public law\u0092 adjudicative system by limiting the ability of\ninvestors to bring treaty claims based on breach of contract. The umbrella clause, in\neffect, simply did not permit tribunals to rule on commercial acts of the State.\nThese concerns were rejected in SGS v Philippines, where the tribunal roundly\ndismissed the apprehension that a broad interpretation of an umbrella clause entailed\nthe \u0091full-scale internationalisation of domestic contracts\u0092.79 Instead, the tribunal distin-\nguished the issues of the scope and content of a State\u0092s contractual obligations from the\nperformance of those obligations, once ascertained. The issue of performance was\nfound to be subject to treaty arbitration, while the former issues were not. Thus, the\numbrella clause allowed the tribunal to rule on a claim that the Philippines had not\nperformed its contractual obligations, although the scope and content of those obliga-\ntions remained subject to the contract. This prompted the tribunal to refrain from ruling\non the treaty claim until the applicable contractual remedies ran their course. In this\ncase, the contract provided that its provisions were governed \u0091in all respects\u0092 by the\nlaws of the Philippines, and that any disputes under the contract were to be filed in the\ncourts of the Philippines.80\nWhether this distinction between the scope and the performance of an obligation\nultimately addresses the concerns of the SGS v Pakistan tribunal is difficult to say in\n390 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n77 ibid para 119.\n78 ibid para 168. The tribunal also found that a broad reading would make superfluous the other\nsubstantive obligations of the States Parties, that the language of the umbrella clause did not\nexpressly refer to \u0091contractual\u0092 commitments, and that the location of the umbrella clause in the\ntreaty text indicated that it was not meant to be a substantive obligation: paras 168\u00969.\n79 SGS v Philippines (n 74) para 126.\n80 ibid para 22.\nthe absence of an award on the merits in SGS v Philippines. Of primary interest here is\nthat it is not possible to limit issues of a State\u0092s performance of a contract to the public\nrealm in light of the uniqueness of juridical sovereign. Any private party is capable of\n\u0091performing\u0092 a contract. As such, the approach in SGS v Philippines constitutes treaty\narbitration more clearly as a form of adjudication in the private sphere, by allowing an\ninvestor\u0092s claim of breach of contract to proceed against the State. In contrast, in SGS\nv Pakistan, the tribunal rejected this outcome in order to maintain the autonomies of\nthe worlds of treaty and contract.\nA practical difficulty with reading umbrella clauses to allow the treaty arbitration of\nprivate law claims against the State is that umbrella clauses may require States to abide\nby contractual commitments regardless of the agreed choice of forum, as determined\nby the contract itself. This returns us to the question of whether an umbrella clause,\ngiven its generality, simply aggregates and internationalizes the contractual duties of\nthe State. If so, then a breach of the umbrella clause surely depends on an interpreta-\ntion of all of the terms and conditions of the contract, including its provisions on\ndispute settlement. As intimated by the SGS v Philippines tribunal, how can a State fail\nto perform a contractual commitment, and violate an umbrella clause, unless the\ninvestor had already impugned the State by successfully bringing a claim under the\ndispute settlement mechanism of the contract? To permit investor claims to proceed\nbased on an umbrella clause in the treaty, independent of previously agreed dispute\nsettlement provisions in the contract, fails to interpret the commitments of the State\nbased on the contract as a whole. It is a selective approach to the incorporation of\ndisputes arising from commercial acts of the State into the realm of treaty arbitration.\nThis leads us to the underlying public\u0096private concern with respect to an interpre-\ntation of umbrella clauses that allows treaty-based arbitration of private law claims\nagainst the State. With an umbrella clause in a treaty, the State\u0092s consent is not limited\nto a single relationship or transaction with another private party. Rather, it extends in\nprinciple to any claim by an investor of alleged breach of contract by the State. The\ngenerality of the State\u0092s consent may indeed suffice to constitute an adjudication based\non that consent as public law in light of the intimate connection between the consent\nitself and the uniqueness of the State as a representative entity. That is, it is difficult to\nconceive of a private party giving consent to abide by all of its commitments with\nrespect to other private parties within its jurisdiction in the manner of a State.\nThis application of the public\u0096private distinction does not mean that an umbrella\nclause should be read as imposing no obligation whatsoever on the State. It means\nsimply that an obligation assumed in an investment treaty should be read in light of the\ngenerality of the State\u0092s commitment. One might, for instance, interpret umbrella\nclauses as imposing obligations which are distinguishable as sovereign duties from the\ncontractual obligations to which they relate, as well as from other sovereign obligations\nunder the treaty (ie to ensure full protection and security or to refrain from expropria-\ntion without compensation). On this reading, a breach of contract by the State would\nviolate the treaty only to the extent that the State\u0092s compliance with the contract flowed\nfrom a duty of the State that could not attach to any private party. This would extend\nthe scope of investment treaty arbitration into the realm of contract-based adjudication,\nbut only to the extent that commercial arbitration is itself used to resolve regulatory\ndisputes, as in the case of a stabilization clause in a contract.81 Thus, the range of\nInternational Arbitration Claims against the State 391\n81 See UNCTAD (n 65) 27\u009631.\ndisputes that would be arbitrable under an umbrella clause would broadly coincide with\nthe State\u0092s capability to use international commercial arbitration as a governing\narrangement in itself. The main difference between the two would continue to be the\ndegree of specificity of the State\u0092s consent to abide by its \u0091public law\u0092 obligations, as\ngoverned by the contract. But, by limiting the encroachment of treaty arbitration on the\nprivate sphere, its integrity as public law adjudication would be preserved, with a corre-\nsponding limit on the generalized liability of States for commercial acts.\nOf course, there are other interpretive options; one need not equate the duties\nimposed by umbrella clauses to contractual obligations that are themselves sovereign\nin character. The idea is to interpret a treaty obligation of a State to abide by its contrac-\ntual commitments in light of the wide-ranging nature of such an obligation. Another\nway to do so is to interpret umbrella clauses as simply imposing an obligation of sover-\neign non-interference with the resort by investors to the dispute settlement mechanisms\nof their contracts with the State.82 On this basis, the obligation would link the duty of\nStates to refrain from denying justice to foreign nationals to the terms of specifically\nagreed dispute settlement provisions. Alternatively, establishing a breach of the treaty\nobligation by the State might require evidence of malicious interference with a specific\ncontract by the State, or intentional breach of statutory or prerogative powers, consis-\ntent with elements of the common law tort of misfeasance in a public office.83 In either\ncase, the obligations imposed by umbrella clauses are conceived of in terms of a regu-\nlatory duty of the State to observe its obligations in general, rather than an all-encom-\npassing obligation to respect every single commitment entered into by the State in a\nprivate capacity. The duty of States is to refrain from \u0091using their sovereign powers to\nescape from contractual commitments\u0092.84\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe rise of international arbitration in the resolution of individual claims against States\ndoes not alter the fact that adjudication goes to the core of juridical sovereignty. For the\nsame reason, though, the claim that the rise of international commercial arbitration\nsignals a retreat of the State from its classical role in relation to adjudication is exag-\ngerated. Where the courts\u0092 endorsement of arbitration is limited to commercial disputes\nbetween private parties, even if one party happens to be a State entity, the State never-\ntheless retains its control over the recognition of party autonomy and of the right of\nindividuals to eschew the courts in favour of arbitration. An exception arises in inter-\nnational commercial arbitration when the State agrees to contractual provisions that\npurport to bind the State in a sovereign capacity. In particular, the interpretation of\nstabilization clauses permits arbitrators to resolve the conundrum of how a private act\nof the State can operate to bind sovereign conduct, and thus to delineate the legal scope\nof the public sphere.\nEven so, the State retains significant control over the delegation of this public law\ncompetence to arbitrators by the State\u0092s consideration of whether to enter into specific\ncontracts with foreign firms. Investment treaties alter this dynamic. As I have argued,\n392 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n82 As suggested in SGS v Pakistan (n 74).\n83 PW Hogg and PJ Monahan, Liability of the Crown (3rd edn, Carswell, Toronto, 2000)\n143\u00964.\n84 UNCTAD (n 65) 35, n 15.\ninvestment treaty arbitration is a type of public law adjudication, both because it is\nestablished by a sovereign act of the State and because it is used to resolve regulatory\ndisputes. Thus, the rulings of arbitrators pursuant to investment treaties are unlike\nconventional awards issued in the arbitration of disputes between juridical equals. They\ninvolve governmental choices that are akin to the judicial determination of individual\nproperty and economic rights in domestic public law. To reduce investment treaty arbi-\ntration to a category of international commercial arbitration is to understate its trans-\nformative impact.\nThe importance of the public\u0096private distinction in international arbitration is not\nwhat it tells us about sovereignty in general, but what it reveals about the role played\nby arbitrators in interpreting questions of public law that were previously determined\nby the courts. The lesson of Texaco is that an arbitrator may interpret a stabilization\nclause in a contract broadly so as to constitute arbitration as a method of government.\nLikewise, the SGS arbitrations show that arbitrators may read umbrella clauses in an\ninvestment treaty in a manner that converts a contractual breach by the State into an\ninternational wrong. The former extends the reach of private law adjudication into the\npublic sphere; the latter does essentially the opposite. In both cases, though, the end\nresult is the same: arbitrators exercise the authority to expand their competence over\nindividual claims against the State, in the foggy borderland between the worlds of\npublic and private. The tension and uncertainty generated by the public\u0096private distinc-\ntion is nothing new in adjudication.85 What is exceptional is that private contractors\nrather than tenured judges are left to manage the legal construction of the public sphere,\nwithout rigorous supervision by courts. The ultimate authority to determine what\njuridical sovereignty means is itself privatized.\nUnder investment treaties, as noted, States delegate to arbitrators a comprehensive\njurisdiction over individual claims against the State, thus relinquishing the ability of the\nState to limit the use of arbitration in public law to specific contracts and legal rela-\ntionships. For this reason, the retreat of the State from classical adjudication is more\ndecisive and wide-ranging in the case of investment treaty arbitration than in interna-\ntional commercial arbitration. With the former, States have delegated comprehensive\njurisdiction over public law to a small group of legal service providers who operate in\nan international market for private adjudication.86 The appropriateness of this develop-\nment has not been the focus of this article. Yet, it is important to note that the security\nof tenure of judges is a key pillar of their independence from both executive govern-\nment and wealthy litigants. Further, because in international treaty arbitration it is\nexclusively private parties who bring the claims and who activate the system as an\nalternative to the courts, all arbitrators may be seen to have a commercial interest in\nexpanding the scope and remedial power of the system so that arbitration may thrive as\na business. More than anything, then, the significance of international arbitration in the\nretreat of the State is its institutional entrenchment of an uncomfortable union between\nadjudication-as-business and public law.\nGUS VAN HARTEN*\nInternational Arbitration Claims against the State 393\n85 See C Harlow, State Liability\u0097Tort Law and Beyond (OUP, Oxford, 2004) 31.\n86 Y Dezaley, \u0091Between the State, Law, and the Market: The Social and Professional Stakes in\nthe Construction and Definition of a Regulatory Arena\u0092 in WW Bratton et al (eds), International\nRegulatory Competition and Coordination (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996) 84\u00966; Rau (n 28) 455,\n488, 496\u00967 and 521.\n* Law Department, London School of Economics.\n"}
