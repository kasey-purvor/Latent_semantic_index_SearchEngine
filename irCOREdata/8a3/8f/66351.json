This pilot project was designed to provide AS- and A-level students \nwith additional opportunities to study Further Mathematics, through the use of \ndistance-learning materials.  This was in response to the dramatic decline in the \nnumbers of students taking Further Mathematics over the last four decades.  An \nindependent evaluation of the project was commissioned by GTEP, and this paper \ndescribes the methodology of the evaluation and its findings.  In addition to highlighting \nthe benefits of the project for students and institutions involved, the paper discusses how \nthe project could be developed in the future, based on the issues and difficulties raised in \nthe evaluation. \n \n \n1. Background \n \nThe number of students participating in A-level Further Mathematics has declined \ndramatically over the last forty years.  Figures from the London Mathematical Society \n(London Mathematical Society, 1995) showed that the number of double mathematics entries \nin England and Wales fell from 15,600 to 5,400 in 1994.  This corresponded to an actual rise \nin single mathematics entries from 43,200 to 56,900. There have been some signs of \nimprovement more recently (Heard, 1998), with double mathematics entries in A- and AS-\nlevel rising from 5400 in 1995 to 7400 in 1997 for students in England, Wales and Northern \nIreland.  However, the numbers doing Further Mathematics remain a small fraction of single \nmathematics entries.  Reasons put forward for this decline in student numbers include (from \nStripp, 2001) \n \n\u2022 The cost of running Further Mathematics courses in schools with such small numbers \ntaking the subject. \n\u2022 A lack of suitably qualified mathematics teachers able to teach the subject. \n \nIt was felt that the problem could become worse with the introduction of Curriculum 2000, \nemphasising the importance of \u2018breadth\u2019 in post-16 education. \n There have been very few comparative distance learning projects, or their evaluations, \nat the pre-university stage in the UK. A search through the research literature failed to find \nany other evaluations for distance-learning initiatives in mathematics for students in \nsecondary schools or colleges1.  Rather, those evaluations that were found were for courses \naimed at undergraduate or postgraduate students. (Examples of some UK-based initiatives are \nWilliams, 2002, Issroff and Eisenstadt, 1997, and Tanner and Jones, 2000.)  This paper \n                                                 \n1 This search was done through the electronic databases of the British Education Index and ERIC, using \n\u2018evaluation\u2019 and \u2018mathematics\u2019 as search terms.  \n 1\ntherefore provides a description and an evaluation of a distance education project carried out \nat this earlier stage of learning. \n \n \n2. Structure of the \u2018Enabling Access to Further Mathematics\u2019 \nproject \n \nIn response to the declining student numbers in Further Mathematics, Mathematics in \nEducation and Industry (MEI) set up the \u2018Enabling Access to Further Mathematics\u2019 project.  \nThis was a three-year pilot project, designed to provide students with the opportunity of \nstudying the subject and \u2018to show that it is possible to teach Further Mathematics effectively \nand economically by distance-learning\u2019 (Stripp, 2001).  Access to learning was provided \nthrough distance-learning materials available on MEI\u2019s website.  Designated lead centres \nprovided administrative support for schools and colleges taking part in the project.  Tutors \nfrom these lead centres provided learning support to students through video-conferencing, e-\nmail, telephone and fax contact, as well as face-to-face meeting between tutors and students. \n The pilot study ran for three years (2000 to 2003), the first year involving the \ndevelopment of the distance-learning materials, and the project being run with lead centres \nand schools\/colleges in 2001\/02 and 2002\/03.  The project involved four lead centres; a \nFE\/sixth form college, an 11-18 comprehensive school and two universities.  The funding for \nthe school and one of the universities, enabling them to take part in the project, was provided \nby the Gatsby Technical Education Projects (GTEP) organisation.  The FE college was \nfunded by the Learning and Skills Development Agency, and the other university funded \nthemselves through \u2018widening participation\u2019 funds available to them.  It was proposed that \nthe project would become self-financing through a charge, payable to the lead centre, being \nmade to schools\/colleges to become members in the scheme.  The funding to pay this charge \nwas to be obtained by schools\/colleges from Learning Skills Council funding, although \nadditional funding could possibly be obtained from sources such as \u2018Excellence in Cities\u2019 or \n\u2018Gifted and Talented\u2019 funding.  As well as being part of the distance-learning project, \nschools\/colleges could alternatively ask for access to the web-based resources to use in their \nmathematics teaching.  This involved a small fee payable directly to MEI by the \nschools\/colleges. \n \n \n3. Evaluation Methodology \n \nThis evaluation of the Further Mathematics project was commissioned by GTEP with the aim \nof determining what worked and what needed improving as part of the project, thereby \ninforming the future development of this initiative.  To determine the overall impact of the \nproject and the various difficulties it entailed, data from a number of different sources was \ngathered together for the study: \n \n\u2022 Interviews with the lead centre tutors in all four centres. \n\u2022 Interviews with mathematics teachers from three schools taking part in the project.  \nThese were chosen through recommendations via the lead centre contacts, the \ninterviews being restricted to three, based on the availability of the contacts for \ninterview and time constraints on the evaluation. \n\u2022 Questionnaires sent to the contacts from schools\/colleges taking part in the project. \n 2\n\u2022 Questionnaires sent to the contacts from schools\/colleges that were not part of the \nproject but were using the distance-learning materials to supplement their teaching of \nmathematics.  \n\u2022 Questionnaires were sent to Year 12 and 13 pupils participating in the project in \n2002\/03.  \n \nThe interviews with tutors and teachers were carried out face-to-face with the \nresearcher, except in the case of one lead centre where the interview with the tutor was \ncarried out by telephone.  The interviews were organised in a semi-structured manner, with \npre-defined questions used to explore the following issues concerning the project: \n \n\u2022 The aims of the project. \n\u2022 The take-up of the project. \n\u2022 The implementation of the project. \n\u2022 The collaboration between different parties involved. \n\u2022 The quality of the learning resources. \n\u2022 The impact on student achievement and attitude towards mathematics. \n\u2022 The wider impact of the project. \n\u2022 The financing of the project. \n\u2022 Lessons for future development. \n \nAll interviews were recorded and transcribed, with transcripts sent to interviewees to allow \nfor any corrections or retractions that they may have wished to make. \n The questionnaires to teachers and students looked at their perceptions towards a \nvariety of issues, including how they viewed the distance-learning course, their views on the \nweb-based resources, the lead centre support and the benefits and costs of the project.  The \nstudents were also asked about their attitudes towards mathematics.  MEI provided the names \nof the schools and colleges taking part in the project or using the distance-learning materials.  \nThe contacts from the institutions taking part in the project provided the names of students in \nYear 12 or 13 who were doing the distance-learning course in 2002\/03.  The numbers of \nquestionnaires that were sent out and received back were \n \nTable 1: Numbers of questionnaires sent out and received in the evaluation \nQuestionnaire to: Number sent out Number received Response rate \nSchools\/Colleges taking part in the \nproject 24 10 42% \nSchools\/Colleges just using the distance-\nlearning materials 62 33 53% \nYear 12 and 13 students 61 15 25% \n \nPossible reasons for the low response rate for students was that they had to be contacted by e-\nmail in most cases, and that the addresses may not have been up-to-date.  Also, most of the \nYear 13 students had left school or college when the questionnaire was sent out, adding to the \ndifficulty of contacting them.  \n \n \n \n \n 3\n4. Findings \n \nThe findings of the various parts of the evaluation are presented below.  These findings are \nseparated into the different themes emerging from the study.  Questionnaire data is used to \nsupport the statements made in the interviews, but because of the small numbers of \nquestionnaires returned, no statistical analysis is carried out on the data.  Rather, the data is \npresented simply as the number of responses to each question.  In addition to direct \nquotations being used from the interviews with lead centres and schools, some open \ncomments from the student questionnaires are presented to illustrate their views. \n \n \nAccessing Further Mathematics \n \n Perhaps the most important question that the evaluation needed to answer was \nwhether the project increased access for students to Further Mathematics.  The responses \nfrom schools suggested that this was perceived to be the case, with the additional benefit of \ndepartments being able to show that they could offer Further Mathematics. \n \n\u201cThe guy who runs the 6th form school welcomes it. He sees it as a nice \ndiversification from what we normally offer, and he also sees these gifted students \ncoming in to us and we should be able to offer it because we\u2019re a strong \ndepartment. It\u2019s just because of time, space, staffing and monetary constraints \nthat we can\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t take four hours a week for one student. The Bursar \nwould string me up, it just wouldn\u2019t be viable, but we can do it this way and it\u2019s a \ngood way to do it. It\u2019s been proven that it works this way.\u201d  \n \nIn one case, being able to provide Further Mathematics gave the school the opportunity of \nseeing whether the course could be provided \u2018in-house\u2019 in the future.  The questionnaire \nresponses from schools\/colleges and students certainly indicated there was an impact on the \naccessibility to the subject (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Questions relating to accessibility to Further Mathematics \nDid your department teach Further Maths before the start of the MEI project? \n(Responses from schools\/colleges) \n No 6    \n Yes  4    \n     \nIn the absence of the MEI course, would you have been able to study Further Mathematics? \n(Responses from students) \n No 13   \n Yes  2   \n \n \nAttainment and attitude towards mathematics \n \n Another important issue for the project was its impact on student attitudes and \nattainment in mathematics.  Table 3 shows the available examination results for students \nhaving taken part in the project.  Averaging over the results from both years, the drop in \ngrade going from mathematics to further mathematics was 0.5 of a grade for both the AS- and \nA-level further mathematics grade.  Although we were dealing with small numbers of \n 4\nstudents, this seemed to be comparative to data from students not taking part in the distance-\nlearning project2.      \n \nTable 3: Examination results for students involved in the project \n \n2001\/02 Examination Results 2002\/03 Examination Results \nStandards A-level \nMathematics Grade \nAS-level Further \nMathematics (or full A-\nlevel if indicated) through \nproject \nStandards A-level \nMathematics Grade \nAS-level Further \nMathematics (or full A-\nlevel if indicated) through \nproject \nA A A A (full A-level) \nB A (full A-level) B B (full A-level) \nA A A B (full A-level) \nA B A B (full A-level) \nC E A A \nA A A A \nA A A A \nA B B B \nD E D A \nU U B C \nA A C D \nB A A B \nA B A B (full A-level) \nC D A B \nB D A A \nB E A A \nA B B C \nA A B B (full A-level) \n  A C \n  A A \n  A A \n  B D (full A-level) \nRegarding the attitudes towards mathematics for those taking part in the project, \nTable 4 shows that, despite the small student numbers, there seemed to be a clear indication \nof positive attitudes and perception of benefits from the project. \n \nTable 4: Questions relating to student attitude towards mathematics \n Strongly \nAgree \nAgree Not sure Disagree Strongly \nDisagree \nStudying Further Mathematics has \nbenefited my other subjects 6 5 2 - 1 \nMy other subjects have suffered due to \nthe demands of Further Mathematics - 1 5 2 6 \nStudying Further Mathematics has \ndeepened my interest in Mathematics  8 4 - 2 - \nThe study of Further Mathematics has \nmade me more likely to study \nMathematics at university \n6 4 1 1 2 \nStudying Further Mathematics has \nbenefited my A level Maths studies 9 2 2 - - \n                                                 \n2 2003 data from the University of Durham\u2019s ALIS (A-level Information System) project showed that the \naverage grade drop for students taking part in ALIS was 0.5 of a grade going from A-level mathematics to AS-\nlevel further mathematics (based on 1241 students), and 0.6 of a grade going from the A-level mathematics to \nA-level further mathematics (based on 455 students). \n 5\n \nComments from school staff and lead centre tutors also highlighted the benefits of study \ndays, bringing together students from different institutions. \n \n\u201cThe boys and girls who would take up this course are usually the best in the \nschool and they know that they\u2019ve always been the best in their year.  But then \nwhen they go out into the world they see people who are even better than them at \nmathematics and it takes them onto another level.\u201d \n \n\u201cThat has been the most enjoyable part of the project so far for me to bring them \ntogether, to see them develop as a sort of little mathematical community.  You\u2019ve \ngot kids who are in schools who are pretty ashamed to be good at Maths.  If \nyou\u2019re in a school like this you wouldn\u2019t make a big fuss about being good at \nMaths, because you would be a social outcast \u2026 So bringing them together and \nseeing that there were people like them in other schools was really nice.  They got \non.\u201d  \n  \n\u201cI had a lot of fun whilst enjoying mathematics.  I met new people and new \nfriends and overall, I loved the experience.  It became the highlight of my week.\u201d  \n \n \n \nWider benefits \n \n One of the wider benefits of the project for students was the encouragement of \nindependent study amongst students. \n \n\u201c(The student has) actually grown up an awful lot because of this independence \nthat he\u2019s had and because he\u2019s had to take charge of his education. He\u2019s had to \ndo an awful lot of independent learning. It\u2019s been very much a university \neducation in that he\u2019s had all the books and been told to get on with it and work \nfrom the books. It has been difficult for him but he\u2019s then got the confidence to \nknow that he can go on and do whatever he wants if he turns his mind to it and he \ncan go on to whatever.\u201d \n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s also helped some of them with individual study, getting them ready for the \nuniversity years coming up, because they\u2019ve had to learn self reliance and self \norganisation \u2026 One or two Heads of Departments have said \u2018It\u2019s widened my lad \nor lass\u2019s perception of what life at university is about\u2019, and it\u2019s helped them to \nmature and raise their horizons.\u201d  \n \n\u201cAt the beginning of the year I found it very difficult as I was not used to teaching \nmyself new concepts, but after a couple of weeks of hard work, I learnt how to \nstudy more quickly and efficiently.\u201d \n \nIn addition to possibly benefiting the students\u2019 future study at university, the universities \ninvolved in the project have also benefited from widening the participation of students. \n \n 6\n\u201cI think the university is considered to be a bit aloof by the local population and \nour average (of enrolling local students) is not good at Maths.  So this has been a \nreally positive example\u2026\u201d \n \n\u201cI\u2019m on the (University) Widening Participation Group, and at the moment, it \nlooks like Maths has had the biggest increase in their students from non-\ntraditional backgrounds or low participation backgrounds.  Nearly all of them, \nthe students come in from schools like this and other ones have been part of the \nproject\u2026\u201d  \n \n \nSupporting the project \n \n The evaluation of the \u2018Enabling Access to Further Mathematics\u2019 project also focussed \non how the project was run, i.e. how students and schools\/colleges were supported in their \nparticipation of the project by lead centres and by MEI themselves.  In general, the attitudes \nof schools and colleges were positive towards this support (Table 5). \n \nTable 5: Responses of schools\/colleges to 'How would you rate the following MEI resources?' \n Web-based materials Study days Lead Centre tutorial support\nVery Good 3 9 10 \nGood 5 - - \nSatisfactory 1 - - \nPoor - - - \nVery Poor - - - \n \nAlthough there were some suggestions for improvements to the web-based resources (e.g. to \ncover more materials, to be more generic for other syllabuses), the schools and colleges that \nused the resources to supplement their mathematics teaching3 and the students that took part \nin the project viewed the resources positively (Table 6). \n \nTable 6:  Responses of schools\/colleges and students to \u2018How would you rate the web-based resources?\u2019 \n Schools\/colleges Students \nVery Good 11 6 \nGood 18 6 \nSatisfactory 2 2 \nPoor - - \nVery Poor - - \n \nThe lead centre support of institutions and students, and the study days supplied by tutors, \nwere once again viewed positively in the questionnaires (Table 7). \n Those involved in the project therefore viewed the support mechanisms for the project \npositively. An interesting issue that emerged from the findings though was the practicalities \nof how this support was delivered, especially in terms of how tutorial support was provided to \nstudents.  Student questionnaire responses showed that support was mainly provided through \nvisits to and from the lead centre tutor and through e-mail contact (Table 8).   \n \n                                                 \n3 This question was only asked of the schools and colleges that were using the MEI web-based materials to \nsupplement their teaching, not those taking part in the distance-learning project. \n 7\n \nTable 7: Responses of schools\/colleges and students concerning lead centre support \n \nIn general, was the Lead Centre support sufficient to run the course properly? \n(Responses from schools\/colleges) \n Definitely Yes 9   \n Generally Yes 1    \n Not Really -   \n Definitely No -   \n     \nIn general, how would you rate the tutorial support? \n(Responses from students) \n Very Good 7   \n Good 1   \n Satisfactory 3   \n Poor 1   \n Very Poor -   \n     \nIn general, how would you rate the study days? \n(Responses from students) \n Very Good 6   \n Good 4   \n Satisfactory -   \n Poor -   \n Very Poor -   \nTable 8: Questionnaire data on how students accessed tutorial support \nHow did you access Lead Centre tutorial support?

This preference for face-\nto-face contact was in contrast to interviewees\u2019 attitudes towards video-conferencing with \nstudents.  Although there was recognition that video-conferencing might be preferred to \nsupport students in schools and colleges that were at some distance from the lead centres, the \ntutors would rather have met directly with students. \n 8\n \n\u201cI was quite wary of having to do video-conferencing and teach a whole load of \nnew material, it wasn\u2019t new material but you know it was different.  So it just so \nhappened all the schools were concentrated in terms of the geography so I made \na decision right from the start I would do school visits in the first year of actually \nteaching.\u201d \n \n\u201cI really got to know the students and it really helped, they just get the benefits of \nface-to-face which is, I think, much more preferable to video-conferencing.  Next \nyear I am going to experiment with some video-conferencing because there are \nsome schools which are just too far to go to who want to get involved.\u201d \n \nTutors also raised particular problems that they had encountered with video-conferencing. \n \n\u201c(In the first institution), when we got the technical bits right, settings and all \nthat sort of \u2018techy\u2019 things sorted out, we established contact beautifully \u2026 Up at \n(the other institution), they decided they would use their existing facilities.  Now \ntheir existing ISDN line involved something called a gateway \u2026 They would have \ntwo or three points in the college linked to their ISDN line but it would all be fed \nthrough one gateway, one major link, and our impression was that they never \nactually got it right in the sense, that the signal was always poor and the thing \nwas always either breaking up sound-wise\u2026\u201d \n \n\u201cI looked into video-conferencing and found that would be difficult based at my \nend, because of the network and all the problems with firewall and stuff.  You \nknow, at peak times, it really slows down \u2026 and not having the compatibility \nbetween networks as well.\u201d \n \nThe issue was also raised that video-conferencing could only be used with a few students at a \ntime, and not with the larger groups that some of the lead centres were working with. \n \n \nIssues and difficulties \n  \nIn addition to the particular difficulty with video-conferencing highlighted above, the \nevaluation raised other issues concerning the project.  Converse to the benefits for university-\nbased lead centres that were raised above, there were also possible difficulties for non-\nuniversity lead centres such as the perception of schools or colleges supporting other schools \nor colleges. \n \n\u201cIf you\u2019re a school who wants to teach Further Maths to some kids in another \nschool, they will not like that.  But if you can say it\u2019s under the auspices of (a \nuniversity) then that\u2019s ok.\u201d \n \nAlso, in contrast to one of the university lead centres using widening participation funds, \nthere was the difficulty of non-university lead centres funding the project.   \n \n\u201cI think we were looking ahead to the future and the writing was on the wall for \nus as being a Centre \u2026 because we can\u2019t make any financial commitment \n 9\nwhereas the Universities have little pockets of money which they can call on at \ndifferent times and it\u2019s good PR.\u201d \n \nWith other issues such as availability of resources and facilities and time constraints on staff, \nit was perceived that it would also be easier for universities to be lead centres. \n The issue of funding is an important one, especially when we come to consider the \nfuture viability of the project.  One lead centre contact felt that the centres needed to finance \nthe project in its initial stages so that numbers of participating students could be built up.  \nComments from lead centres indicated that money from the Excellence in Cities and Gifted \nand Talented initiatives would be required so that sufficient funds would be available for the \nrequired lead centre support. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to them independently and they can only continue with the \nproject if they get the money from Excellence in Cities \u2026 I don\u2019t want to leave the \nstudents high and dry but if they want the project to continue, I think they\u2019re \ngoing to have to put their hands a bit deeper into their pockets.\u201d \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether there is ever going to be pressure to break even, because it \ndoesn\u2019t matter how many students you\u2019ve got, unless they get to be in large \ngroups in which case the schools should be running it themselves.  That 45 to 50 \nminutes per student is going to stay, so the extra schools, that\u2019s going to mean \nyou\u2019re going to have to drive round to them or you\u2019re going to have to video-con \nthem in different schools from each other \u2026 It\u2019s never going to break even unless \nyou just happen to be lucky and the students come from places where there is a \nGifted and Talented (G&T) situation through Excellence in Cities and they are \nactually happy to let you have extra support funding through G&T.\u201d  \n \nThe views of the schools themselves who were interviewed were varied with regards to \nfunding. One felt that additional funding was required for areas such as managing the project \nwithin schools and providing transport for students, but another felt that the funding from the \nLearning Skills Council alone was sufficient.  Questionnaire responses from schools and \ncolleges indicated that approximately a third of them found the project \u2018moderately \ndemanding\u2019 on their resources (Table 9). \n \nTable 9: Demands on school\/colleges\u2019 resources \n Extremely Demanding Moderately Demanding Undemanding \nAcademic support for FM students 1 3 6 \nEmotional support for FM students - 1 9 \nAssociated project administration - 3 6 \nAssociated project costs - 3 5 \n  \n A possible area of difficulty that was raised for the students involved in the project \nwas that additional workload that the project entailed.  One school raised the issue of students \n\u2018not coping\u2019 with the distance-learning aspect of the project. \n \n\u201cThe distance nature of it, I think that some of them just aren\u2019t mature enough to \ncope with that.  They\u2019ve got good intentions but they never quite get round to \ngoing on to the website, they\u2019ll probably go on to the computer, they might even \ngo on to the internet but getting on to that actual website to do some work doesn\u2019t \n 10\nquite happen.  Some of them just felt that they couldn\u2019t do it that way, they said if \nwe offered it taught they would manage it but they couldn\u2019t do it on their own.\u201d  \n \nLooking at the questionnaire responses from students (Table 10), they seemed to be an even \nsplit between those that preferred or did not prefer the distance-learning method, although the \nrespondents generally felt that they had coped well with their course. \n \nTable 10: How students felt about the 'self-study' course \n \nHow have you coped with the \u2018self-study\u2019 style of the MEI course? \n(Responses from students) \n Very well 5  \n Generally well 7  \n It\u2019s been difficult at times 1  \n Not very well 1  \n    \nHow did the \u2018self-study\u2019 style of learning compare with the more traditional classroom-based approach? \n(Responses from students) \n Definitely better 3  \n Generally better 3  \n About the same 1  \n Generally worse 3  \n Definitely worse 3  \n \n \nFuture development of the project \n \nThe final theme arising from the findings was the possible future development of the \n\u2018Enabling Access to Further Mathematics\u2019 project.  One possible development that was raised \nin the interviews and in the questionnaires to schools and colleges was the expansion of the \ndistance-learning materials to cover a number of syllabuses, and perhaps use them for \ndifferent age groups. \n \n \u201cI think where the MEI project will go will be, and I know it is going that way, is \nthat the resources will get bigger and better and probably more generic.  \u2026 I \nthink it will start to become valuable for the accelerated pupils that are taking \ntheir GCSE\u2019s at the end of Year 10.\u201d \n \nAnother possible suggestion was the use of \u2018sub-centres\u2019 or \u2018cluster centres\u2019, where students \nare brought together from different schools and colleges.  This would enable tutors to provide \nface-to-face support to larger numbers of students, therefore coping with larger students \nnumbers as well as making the project more financially viable.  The lead centres could also \nuse additional personnel to help with this support. \n \n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t got a colleague from (a neighbouring university) joining me in the \nautumn, we\u2019d now be completely swamped \u2026 I mean you\u2019re swamped with over \nfifteen kids if you\u2019re on your own, let\u2019s be straight about that.  So I mean I would \nquestion anybody who reckons they can do more than fifteen kids unless they\u2019re \nin big groups and it\u2019s virtually their only job.\u201d \n \n\u201cI think we need to look at different models, one of which might be using retired \nMaths teachers.  So the model might be I do some teaching but also part of my \n 11\njob is also to find good Maths teachers who are now part-time, who would enjoy \nhaving little Further Maths classes here and there and doing something like that.  \nThat\u2019s how I imagine it might work if it got any bigger.\u201d  \n \n \n \n5. Discussion \n \nBased on the emerging themes from the findings, we can highlight what worked and make \nsuggestions for the future development of the \u2018Enabling Access to Further Mathematics\u2019 \nproject. \n The evaluation has identified definite benefits brought about by the project.  It \nprovided students with the opportunity of studying Further Mathematics and enabled \nmathematics departments to offer this to their students.  The additional benefits for students \nwere the knock-on effect on their single mathematics, and a possible increase in their \nindependence in studying, brought about by the distance-learning nature of the MEI course.  \nThere were also benefits suggested for the university-based learning centres, in terms of \nwidening participation and increasing their profile in their local areas. \n In addition to identifying the possible benefits, we were also able to examine how \nwell the project ran.  In terms of the support provided by the lead centres to students and the \nschools\/colleges involved, the perceptions of those involved were positive (see Table 7).  A \nparticular issue that emerged from the evaluation was how one could provide this support.  \nThere were preferences expressed by tutors and teachers for face-to-face support for students \nby teachers, and additional benefits were identified for study days that brought together \nstudents from different institutions.  Looking to other studies, Tanner and Jones (2000) also \nhighlighted a preference for face-to-face support when they examined the views of PGCE \nstudents taking part in a distance-learning initiative.  In their case, this preference arose from \na perceived lack of camaraderie between peers in the initiative, and a lack of learning \nopportunities that could be gained through face-to-face interaction with tutors and fellow \nstudents. \nPossible difficulties were also identified for non-face-to-face support, in particularly \nfor video-conferencing where problems with links and restrictions on student numbers were \nidentified.  A particular study that examined the use of video-conferencing in teaching and \nlearning was carried out by Knipe and Lee (2002).  They agreed with Tanner and Jones above \nin that some of their conclusions were that video-conferencing did not provide the same \nopportunities for group-work as face-to-face support, and that there was not the mixing of \ndifferent students in order to explore and generate new ideas.  We saw from Table 8 that \nsupport contact by e-mail certainly had its place in the project, and there may be instances, \nfor example for schools or colleges at some distance from lead centres, where support by \nvideo-conferencing is required.  Also, we must be careful not to draw conclusions that are too \ngeneral from the small samples of lead centres and schools\/colleges taking part in the pilot \nproject.  However, what the evaluation highlighted was the importance of face-to-face \nsupport in this project and we would encourage MEI and lead centres to bear this I mind \nwhen considering the future support for the project.   \n A possible restriction however on this face-to-face support of students may be the \nfinancial implications of providing this support, in terms of it being more staff-intensive.  As \na result, we must consider how the project can develop and expand, bearing this restriction in \nmind.  Suggestions were made in the evaluation of taking on additional persons to provide \nsupport, for example retired mathematics teachers.  However, this alone will not solve the \npossible funding problems; rather, this must be accompanied by an increase in student \n 12\nnumbers.  An interesting suggestion made in the evaluation was the use of  \u2018cluster\u2019 or \u2018sub-\ncentres\u2019 where larger numbers of students can be tutored together.  This is therefore another \navenue that can be explored by MEI and lead centres.  There was also a suggestion in the \nevaluation that the financial constraints may be more flexible for university-based lead \ncentres, with their access to additional funds and the obvious benefit of widening \nparticipation.  Therefore, if the project is to be rolled out and new lead centres brought into \nthe project in the future, then these possible advantages for universities should also be \nconsidered.  A final financial issue that should be considered by MEI and lead centres is the \npossible need for some schools and colleges to apply for funds from sources such as Gifted & \nTalented and Excellence in Cities. This additional funding may be helpful for institutions to \ncover their costs to support the project.  Although this may not be required by all those taking \npart in the project, it is suggested that MEI makes sure that this is clear for schools and \ncolleges enrolling in the project. \n  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe researchers would like to thank all the lead centre contacts and the member institution \nstaff for giving up their valuable time to take part in the interviews, and Jonathan Priest for \nthe carrying out the data collection for the evaluation.
