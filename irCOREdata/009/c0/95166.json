The main \nargument is that we need to examine how representations of \u2018race\u2019 are assumed, \nproduced and contested in research practice. This argument is made by a) showing \nhow research in the area adopts everyday representations of \u2018race\u2019 as essentialised \nand b) with an illustration of the construction of \u2018race\u2019 within my study. This study \nexplores how children in a predominantly white setting accept and contest \nrepresentations that race. 22 children from a range of cultural backgrounds \nvolunteered to discuss their views and experiences of \u2018race\u2019 and racism in a \nnaturalistic research activity. The analysis reveals that racialised difference is \nsomething that is constructed as both \u2018real\u2019 \u2013 in that it can be seen, touched and even \ncaught from \u2018the other\u2019 and simultaneously something that is constructed, imposed \nand damaging. This highlights the possibilities for racialised others to take up \npositions as agents and not (only) as objects of the racialising and racist gaze, and so \npresents the case for thinking, debating and researching beyond reifying \nrepresentations of \u2018race\u2019. This has important lessons for Social Psychology: namely, \nwe cannot continue to take racial categorisation as a naturalistic or self-evident aspect \nof the social worlds that our discipline plays an important role in constructing and \ndefending. \n \n \n \n \n 1\n \u201cPsychological theory is not only a commentary on the world and how we behave within it: \nit is also a part of our world and serves to shape our own self-understandings. Those models \nthat serve to reify social categories in theory may also help to reify categories in practice. \nThey tell us that there is only one basis of defining ourselves, only one way of perceiving \nothers, and only one form of intergroup relations. The consequence of telling us that \nparticular forms of domination are inevitable could be to render such domination all the \nmore likely and to make counterdomination strategies all the more futile.\u201d  \nReicher, 2004, p. 942 \n \nReicher makes an important point here: it is all too easy to take reified social categories as if they are the \nonly ways of seeing, constructing and experiencing social relations. In this paper I explore this issue \nthrough an empirical study of racial categorisation. The focus is how people find ways of disrupting, \ncontesting and possibly transforming ways of being raced1 in one particular research context. In order to \nhighlight the original contribution of this study at the level of both theory and method, I first consider the \nways in which psychologists may inadvertently adopt racial categories rather unproblematically, despite \nthe extensive critique of so-called \u2018Race Psychology\u2019 (e.g. Mama, 1995; Richards, 1997; Howitt and \nOwusu-Bempah, 1994) and debate over the role of essentialism in the discipline (e.g. Haslam, Rothschild \nand Ernst, 2000; Medin and Ortony, 1989; Verkuyten, 2003a). For example, some research in this area has \noperationalised \u2018race\u2019 in very straight-forward manner  - often splitting participants into groups of \u2018blacks\u2019 \nand \u2018whites\u2019, \u2018majority\u2019 and \u2018minority\u2019 group members, \u2018native\u2019 versus \u2018immigrant\u2019 samples. This may \nobscure the contextual and relational aspects of identity (Tajfel, 1978; Condor, 2006), the fluidity and \nhybridity of racial identities (Cieslik and Verkuyten, 2006; Brah, 2007) and the dialogicality and \nargumentation at the heart of representations that race (Condor, Figgou, Abell, Gibson, and Stevenson, \n2006).  \n \n                                                 \n1 \u2018Race\u2019 is used both as a noun and a verb in this paper. As a noun \u2018race\u2019 is problematised with speech marks in \norder disrupt its taken-for-grantedness and often naturalised status in both everyday and academic discourses. This \nemphasises the socially constructed nature of \u2018race\u2019. When using race as a verb, to highlight the ways in which we \nproduce \u2018race\u2019 as a seemingly meaningful system of human classification, I have used italics without speech marks.   \n \n 2\nWhat this paper offers is a more nuanced examination of the construction of \u2018race\u2019 in research practice: \nrather than imposing a straightforward system of racial classification onto the design of the study, in the \nsampling strategy or questions asked, and therefore treating \u2018race\u2019 as an a priori object of study, I explore \nhow \u2018race\u2019 is constructed and resisted in this particular research context. My main argument is that we \nneed to examine how representations of \u2018race\u2019 are assumed, produced and contested in research practice.  \nThis argument is made by firstly showing how much research in the area adopts everyday representations \nof \u2018race\u2019 as essentialised and then moving on to examine the construction of \u2018race\u2019 within my own study \nwith children. \n \nUnderstanding \u2018race\u2019 or producing \u2018race\u2019? \nThis study is not the first to point out that racialising representations are resisted and problematised in talk \nand text: there has been a rich tradition of work in this vein (Billig, 1995; Condor et al, 2006; LeCouteur, \nRapley and Augoustinos, 2001, van Dyjk, 1997; Wetherell and Potter, 1992). Nor is the discussion of the \nrole of essentialism in academic studies of social categories by any means original (e.g. Fuss, 1989; \nHaslam et al, 2000; Verkuyten, 2003a). However, there is little empirical work that attempts to look at \nresistance to the ideology of \u2018race\u2019 in the actual process of doing research, as we see here. What is striking \nabout some Psychological studies is the way that \u2018race\u2019 is generally constructed. Following the classic \nwork by Clark (1963), researchers continue to use black, brown and white dolls, photos and drawings to \nelicit preferences (or otherwise) for people with corresponding skin-tones (e.g., Hirschfeld, 1995; \nMcGlothlin and Killen, 2005) 2. For example, in his 1995 paper Hirschfeld has examples of black, grey \nand white drawings of people representing differences in \u2018race\u2019, occupation and body-build. \u2018Race\u2019, he \nexplains, is depicted \u201cthrough variations in skin colour, facial features (lips, nose, overall shape) and hair \n                                                 \n2 As racial categories appear distinct and separate in segregated 1930\u2019s USA, this methodology seems sensible for \nthe contexts the Clarks worked in. Perhaps the same is true of current-day South Africa, reflected in Durrheim and \nDixon\u2019s 2005 study with their straightforward classification of participants as \u2018black\u2019 or \u2018white\u2019. However, the social \nstructures of \u2018race\u2019 have changed to some degree in the US context and quite dramatically in the British context, \nthough there are areas where children may lead \u2018parallel lives\u2019 and have little experience of cosmopolitanism \n(Rutland et al, 2005). My point here is that our methods need to be both historically and contextually sensitive to the \nchanging politics of \u2018race\u2019. Moreover, we need to limit the extent to which reifying representations of \u2018race\u2019 from the \neveryday come to structure and so limit the operationalisation of \u2018race\u2019 in research contexts.  \n 3\ncolour and texture\u201d (p. 222). Racial categories, then, are presented as \u201cconstant\u201d or discrete \u2013 as we can \nclearly distinguish an apple tree from pine tree, children\u2019s perception of \u2018white\u2019, \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018Asian\u2019 \ncategories is treated similarly as a reflection of nature. This carries the potential danger of reifying and \nbiologising \u2018race\u2019, making it a real and irrefutable fact (Gunaratnam, 2003).  \n \nClearly such simplistic racial classifications do not map onto all contemporary experiences of racialised \ndifference and racialised identity \u2013 where children, such as those who participated in this study, may \u2018look \nwhite\u2019 but have Indian heritage, develop a Muslim identity at home and a Liverpudlian identity at school, \nfeel racialised by their white Irish heritage and accent, and so forth. Asking children \u2018what colour their \nuncle should be\u2019 (Aboud, 1988) and constructing racial difference as \u201crelatively homogeneous\u201d (Verkuyen \nand Steenhuis, 2005, p. 661), as \u201cpermanent and objective\u201d (Aboud, 1988, p. 24), and as \u201cstable over \ntime\u201d and context (Rutland, Cameron, Bennett and Ferrell, 2005, p. 701) does not make sense in many of \ntoday\u2019s multicultural relationships. Such complex, fluid, often contradictory relationships are difficult to \nassess in research and they provoke challenging questions about academic constructions of \u2018race\u2019.  \n \nWe can see traces of an ideology of \u2018race\u2019 across Psychological research (Richards, 1997) and it may \nseem unhelpful to pick up examples of this from some of the most insightful and influential studies on \nracial categorisation amongst adults and children. However, to do otherwise would undermine my central \nargument that all researchers need to interrogate the construction of \u2018race\u2019 in their investigative practice. \nHence I shall give further two examples: Durrheim and Dixon (2005) and Verkuyten and Thijs (2002). In \ntheir otherwise deeply penetrating and innovative study of (de)segregation in South Africa Durrheim and \nDixon (2005) use the concept of \u2018contact partners\u2019 which could be said to echo a somewhat essentialised \nand biologised account of racial \u2018others\u2019 \u2013 who are and therefore always will be naturally different, as \ndistinct \u2018races\u2019 - plural. \u2018Contact\u2019 only makes sense on the basis that there are \u201cpeople of different \ngroups\u201d (p. 160); \u2018difference\u2019 being taken for granted, for example, when \u201cmembers of a different race sit \nnext to you on the beach\u201d (p. 171). In the heavily racialised context of (post)apartheid South Africa, it is \n 4\nhard to read the beach scenes described by Durrheim and Dixon in any other way than through the lens of \ndistinct racial groups and racial difference. As Skeggs\u2019 work (1997) highlights so vividly: \u201cthe \nexperiences of the knowledge producers inform the knowledge productions\u201d (p. 167). However, if we take \na broader view, situate our reading within discussions of hybridity and the continuing fiction of racialised \ndifference and so examine the construction of \u2018race\u2019 with research practice \u2013 the representation of \u201cpeople \nof different races\u201d appears problematic.  \n \nAnother general criticism made of Psychological research on \u2018race\u2019 has been clearly expressed by \nVerkuyten and Thijs (2002, p. 313):  \nthere is a tendency to treat ethnic minorities as a homogeneous group which \ncontrasts with the majority group\u2026 That is, a distinction between white and non-\nwhite or between majority and minority group predominates. This approach ignores \nthe many visible and cultural differences between ethnic groups that may affect the \nexperiences of ethnic minority children. \n \nWhat is valuable about Verkuyten\u2019s work is the very exact and sensitive analysis of these differences, as \nwe see in this study of racist victimisation. However, this can also be seen to shape difference in a very \nparticular way and exclude experiences of hybridity and multicultural identities (for an exception see \nCieslik and Verkuyten, 2006). For example, in Verkuyten and Thijs\u2019 study (2002) nearly 4,000 children in \nthe Netherlands were asked about their ethnic background and only \u201cthose children who used the same \nlabel to define themselves as well as their father and mother\u201d (p. 316) included. Children with hyphenated \nethnic-definitions were excluded from the study, and the remaining others were divided into distinct \ngroups (Dutch, Turkish, Moroccan and Surinamese). Hence ethnicity is constructed as discrete in two \nmain ways: a) one necessarily belonging to a singular ethnic category and b) the relationship between \nethnicity and other intersectional aspects of identity (such as class, gender, sexuality, religion, lifestyle and \nso forth) is obscured. The focus is very much on the different experiences of distinct groups, or groups \nmade to appear as distinct with their \u201cown cultures\u201d (p. 385). For example, they explain that \u201cThe \nSurinamese are from the former Dutch colony Surinam. The vast majority are Dutch nationals but their \n 5\nskin colour makes them \u2018visible\u2019.\u201d (p. 313). The significance of this racialised difference is worked into \nthe research design as they are defined as Surinamese not as Dutch and their investment in \u2018Dutch\u2019 culture, \ntheir accents, their lifestyle choices, their national affiliations, which all may challenge this limiting \ncategorisation, are left without discussion 3 . Thus ethnic difference is reified and elevated over the \nintersectional aspects of identity, cultural connections, mixed-heritage and human commonalities (Crisp \nand Hewstone, 2007; Brah, 2007), all of which could be just as important to the participants as their \n\u201cethnic minority\u201d identity 4 . One could consider how far such difference is produced at least in part \nthrough the research design. Without this analysis the constructed research categories appear naturalised \u2013 \nand ethnicity (and less explicitly \u2018race\u2019) presented as unproblematic, essential and natural. The excluded \ncases of mixed-heritage children could have presented a challenge to the arbitrary logic of racialised \ndifference and essentialism that permeates much Social Psychology.  \n \nIn a more recent paper, Verkuyten has recognised that \u201cQuestions of hybridity and multiple identities are \nover-theorised but the number of empirical studies is limited\u201d (Cieslik and Verkuyten, 2006, p. 77). \nSimilarly Gunaratnam (2003) points out that \u201cdespite theoretical understandings of \u2018race\u2019 and ethnicity as \nrelational and socially constructed, there is still a voracious appetite for approaches that freeze, objectify \nand tame \u2018race\u2019\/ethnicity into unitary categories that can be easily understood and managed\u201d (p. 33). One \nreason for this may be the difficulty in developing methods that capture the production of \u2018race\u2019 rather \nthan invite the reification of \u2018race\u2019 as described above. What is particularly challenging is that such a \nstudy of \u2018race\u2019 (as constructed, hybrid and contested) would simultaneously need to reveal the constructed \n                                                 \n3 Another example of this from Verkuyten is his 2003b paper on \u2018Positive and negative self-esteem among ethnic \nminority early adolescents\u2019 in the Netherlands. He describes these adolescents as \u2018Turks\u2019 and \u2018Moroccans\u2019 and they \nare asked questions such as \u201cIs being Turkish (Moroccan) important to you?\u201d, \u201cDo you sometimes regret being \nTurkish (Moroccan)?\u201d (p. 271). As far as we know, they are not also asked if being Dutch is important to them, \ndespite the fact they are second generation and so may (also) identify as Dutch.  \n4 For example, in this study the focus group moderator used various statements to elicit discussion. One of these was \n\u201cTo be able to get ahead in Dutch society, you have to adapt as much as possible and forget your own culture as \nmuch as possible\u201d (Verkuyten, 2003b, p. 379). This produces a binary representation of being Dutch or other. What \nis revealing is the implication that one could not be both.  \n 6\nnature of \u2018race\u2019, examine the social and psychological consequences of racialised categories and expose \nthe role of the researcher in directing and displacing representations of \u2018race\u2019. This is enormously complex.  \n \nOne theory that I have found to be useful in this challenge is Social Representations (Moscovici, 1984), \nparticularly when used to explore the interconnections between representation and identity (see author, \n2002, 2007; Moloney and Walker, 2007). This allows us to examine both the individual or psychological \nprocesses in involved in racialisation and what Rosenberg (2003) calls \u201cthe collective structuring of \nmeaning\u201d (p. 434), here the social practices and cultural traditions that produce \u2018race\u2019 as a meaningful and \nconsequential concept. As Condor et al (2006) have detailed, the majority of psychological accounts of \nprejudice are individualistic in focus \u2013 this includes attitude studies, social cognition and discursive \nanalyses. Because of this individualism, Durrheim and Dixon (2005) advocate that \u201cresearchers must \nexamine changes in the very nature of our shared frameworks for constructing the meaning of our \nrelationships. As important, they must interrogate the collective practices through which such frameworks \nthemselves become (re)produced and institutionalised\u201d (p. 82). Social Representations Theory (SRT) is \nwell equipped to examine such collective practices, their (re)production and institutionalisation (as \nVerkuyten and Steenhuis, 2005, point out) as well as highlighting psychological processes such as \nanchoring, objectification, identification and othering (Howarth, 2006). This has important implications \nfor the methodological design of SRT studies, as we now turn to. \n  \nExperiences of \u2018race\u2019, racism and anti-racism at school: Methods and analysis \nEarly prejudice research demonstrates that children \u201clearn social, racial and religious prejudices in the \ncourse of observing, and being influenced by, the existence of the patterns in the culture in which they \nlive\u201d (Clark, 1963, p. 17). Research with children using SRT shows that they take on and negotiate the \ncultural patterns or social representations salient in their primary relationships at home and school (Lloyd \nand Duveen, 1992). Children are presented with discourses of racial categorisation in geography, history \nand religious studies, for example, where they learn about \u2018whites and blacks\u2019, experience \u2018Black history \n 7\nmonth\u2019 and participate in \u2018cultural diversity\u2019 and anti-racist activities. Hence, schools are an ideal place to \nexamine the collaborative construction of representations that race.  \n \nAs it is from the age of 8 that children are \u201cmost responsive to information and interventions\u201d that target \nracist thinking (Aboud, 1988, p. 24), pupils aged 8 to 12 were invited to participate in this study, based in \na primary school in the South East of England. Following discussions with Potter and his paper with \nHepburn on the limitations of interviews (2005), I designed a research activity emulating small-group \nwork that pupils normally did with adults at school. This involved reading them a short story (a vignette \nconstructed from my pilot research observations5), and inviting discussion around this while they drew \npictures (a naturalistic form of interviewing). My research focus was on the co-production of \nrepresentations of \u2018race\u2019 in the dialogue generated between myself and the children.6  \n \nTwo or three friendship pairs were selected from volunteers from each year group, with approximately \nequal numbers of girls and boys. While white British children7 make up 97% of the school, I over-selected \nchildren with other heritage in order to make up half of the sample. The selected sample consisted of 11 \nchildren describing themselves as white British, English, or mixed categories such as \u2018Irish and Scottish\u2019, \n6 describing themselves as Bangladeshi, British Pakistani, Pakistani, Indian, British Muslim and Muslim \nand 5 with mixed heritage from a range of other countries such as Colombia, Italy, Lebanon, Portugal, \nSpain and Trinidad, as well as the Roma community.  \n \n                                                 \n5 The pilot research consisted of a series of observations in all year groups, break-times and playground activities and \ninformal discussions with staff and pupils over a period of 3 months. The purpose of this was to familiarise myself \nwith the school, its ethos and the pupils. Primarily I wanted to work out a naturalistic method of research that would \nfit into common practices at school and the children\u2019s experiences.  \n6 Being white, female, mid-thirties with Antipodean accent and living in the local area no doubt informed the ways in \nwhich research participants saw and positioned me and so had an impact on how they spoke about \u2018race\u2019 in the study. \nFor a longer discussion on the impact of researcher identity in research into racialising representations see Howarth \n(2002). \n7 After my critique of the reification of ethnic and racialised categories above, my characterisation of children as \n\u2018white British\u2019, \u2018British Pakistani\u2019, \u2018Portuguese-Lebanese English\u2019 and so forth may seem problematic. However, \nthese are self-descriptions and not meant to homogenise identity in a singular or essentialised manner. As \nGunaratnam (2003) has said, we need \u201cto work both with and against racial and ethnic categories\u201d (p. 29).  \n 8\nAs Dixon, Durrheim and Tredoux (2005) recommend, I sought to develop a methodology that \u201cproceeds \nnot from a top-down imposition of pre-given categories but from a detailed, bottom-up analysis of \nparticipants\u2019 own frameworks of meaning as they are applied within particular social contexts\u201d (p. 704). \nUsing story-telling and drawing worked well in this regard \u2013 as this positioned the participants as \n\u201cknowers and actors, not objects of the research\u201d (Pole, Mizen, and Bolton, 1999, p. 46) nor as \u201cobjects of \ndiscrimination\u201d (Hopkins and Kahani-Hopkins, 2006, p. 246).  As the social construction of \u2018race\u2019 is \nrarely explicit in everyday discourse (Billig, 1995), it was important to present the possible significance of \n\u2018race\u2019 in the vignette in quite subtle ways:  \nFaranaz was not very happy at school. There were some others in her class who were \nalways picking on her. They made fun of her name and her accent. One lunchtime \nthey started calling her nasty names. Sarah, who was her best friend, stood up for her \nand told the other girls to go away. This made Faranaz like Sarah even more as she \nthought this was very brave.  \n \nFollowing Barter and Renold\u2019s (2000) recommendations on the use of vignettes, I asked the children how \nthey would feel as the different characters in the story and invited them to tell their own stories and find \nconnections with their own experiences and representations of racism. The process aimed to promote \ncritical reflection and cognitive polyphasia (Jovchelovitch, 2006) and the taking up of multiple positions \nand exploring contradictions \u2013 as I encouraged the children to think about alternative possibilities and to \ndebate with each other and myself, copying teachers\u2019 elicitation techniques. In the analysis I examined the \ndifferent positions we each took up in the course of the research activity (as Hopkins et al, 2006, advise) \nand assessed the relationship between the general ethos at the school, the research context, what I asked \nand what they said (again following Potter and Hepburn, 2005), playing close attention to the \ncontradictions of \u2018race\u2019 and the dialogic production of racism (Figgou and Condor, 2006)8.  \n                                                 \n8 There can be little doubt that social desirability and expectations of positive self-presentational behaviour had an \neffect what was said (Nesdale, Griffith, Durkin and Maass, 2005). The dynamics of most research encounters would \nencourage participants to take a more critical stance on \u2018race\u2019 than in less formalised contexts, such as an unrecorded \nplayground conversation certainly where pupils\u2019 behaviour and talk is less censured, as I found. However, it is \nimportant to stress that I was not exploring what children \u2018really felt\u2019 or trying to encourage the expression of racist \nviews for the dubious sake of documentation; instead I explored the collaborative production of representations of \n\u2018race\u2019 in this very particular context and questioned how these may maintain and\/or challenge essentialising \nideologies of \u2018race\u2019.   \n 9\n All the textual material was analysed thematically using the procedure outlined by Attride-Sterling (2001) \nwhich \u201cprovides a technique for breaking up text, and finding within it explicit rationalizations and their \nimplicit signification\u201d (p. 388). This enabled me to identify and examine key themes in order to establish \nrepresentations of \u2018race\u2019 and how these are contested 9. Verbatim selections of text were chosen that \nreflect the co-construction of representations of \u2018race\u2019 and racism in the dialogue between myself and the \nchildren. Hence the quotes below represent the different themes produced and so they stand for a much \nwider body of material.  \n \nAs developmental research would predict there were some age and gender differences in children\u2019s use of \nracial categories (Aboud, 1988; Hirschfeld, 1995; McGlothlin and Killen, 2005): older children, and \nparticularly girls, are often found to be more reflective and critical of racism. However my sample of 22 is \ntoo small to say anything meaningful about these differences. What is evident, however, is that all children \nused categories in ways that both supported and contested a simplistic or naturalising use of \u2018race\u2019. Even \nthe youngest boys in the study used anti-racist discourses and showed that they were able to critically \nreflect on the construction of \u2018race\u2019. As others have found (Nesdale et al, 2005), developmental and \ngender differences are not consistent, and individuals\u2019 use of racial categories is often contradictory \n(Condor, 2006). Hence my analysis does not attempt to place individuals in particular positions - as \nsupporting or contesting racialising discourses; rather, the analysis reveals the multiple and simultaneous \nways in which racial categories are maintained, developed and contested.  \n \nThe focus of the analysis is this: the construction of \u2018race\u2019 in the accounts given by the children (and so \ntheir experience of \u2018race\u2019 in the everyday as they describe it) and the ways in which the research encounter \ninvites and inhibits these constructions (e.g., what representations of \u2018race\u2019 I invite). For the sake of clarity, \nit is necessary to over-generalise somewhat and depict a continuum where racialised difference is either \n                                                 \n9 For a detailed discussion of the analysis of narratives and drawings see author, 2007. \n 10\nunderstood as real \u2013 in that it can be seen, touched, and even caught from \u2018the other\u2019 or understood \nsomething that is constructed, imposed and damaging. All participants in the study, albeit to different \ndegrees, constructed \u2018race\u2019 as natural and as problematic, as we see in the next two sections.  \n \nReifying \u2018race\u2019: \u201cthey are not the same as us\u201d  \nThe most common theme in the data was that \u2018race\u2019 equates to an obvious, pre-defined and natural \ndifference. What was striking about this construction of difference was how it was presented as both \ncompletely self-evident and as problematic: \u2018other\u2019 children are simply different, marked as different by \ntheir skin-colour, accent, name or clothes - and yet this difference \u2018should not matter\u2019. We can see \ndifference as self-evident in my discussion with Richard below. In the second dialogue with Laura and \nCatherine, the construction of \u2018race\u2019 is more complex. (Catherine, Laura and Richard are all both white \nBritish, all 8 yrs10). \nAuthor name:  Okay, Richard, why do you think that the other children (in the story) picked on \nFaranaz?  \nRichard: Cos she is a different colour, because that sounded like an Indian name and her accent \u2013 and \nbeing different really.  \nAuthor name:  So why do children pick on someone who is a different colour? \nRichard: Because they are not the same as us. \n \n \nAuthor name:  And have you ever seen anything like this?  \nLaura: There was a girl in my old school called Shazia and she was from Pakistan and there was these \npeople that were bullying her and picking on her because she had a little bit of an accent and \ndarker skin and came from a different country. They were saying really nasty words to her \u2013 and \nsaying \u2018errrr I won\u2019t want to be one of your friends \u2013 you\u2019re from a different country \u2013 we are \nfrom the same country! We can do whatever we want, and we can go wherever we want \u2013 and \npeople from other countries are really stupid\u2019 and stuff like that.  \nAuthor name:  And so how did Shiraz feel?  \nLaura: She felt very upset \u2013 she tried to stick up for herself, but it was continuing and continuing and \nso she couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and - \nCatherine: And she probably didn\u2019t want to go to school and she probably said to her mum that she \ndidn\u2019t feel very well \u2013 and that she is scared of going to school.  \nLaura: Yeah \u2013 she did not want to go to school cos she was scared of the people hurting her \u2013 and so \nthe people see that and they were continuing.  \nAuthor name:  And has anyone been horrible to you in this way?  \n                                                 \n10 At the very start of the research activity, before they were read the story, all the children choose the pseudonyms \nthat used here. This is discussed in below.  \n 11\nCatherine: Yeah \u2013 a couple of days ago \u2013 sometimes some of the others fell out with me \u2013 for the \nstupidest of reasons. Then they all follow with that and follow them.  \nAuthor name:  Laura?  \nLaura: No \u2013 not really cos I am English. No one can be horrible to me because I am English \u2013 and \nEnglish people are stronger than other people. We can stick up for ourselves.  \nAuthor name:  So \u2013 the story that you told me about the girl from Pakistan \u2013 do you think that was \nracist?  \nLaura: I don\u2019t really know what racism is \u2013 if someone is different it is not horrible to SAY that they \nare different. If someone has a funny accent or wears funny clothes it is not horrible to say that \u2013 \nbut you should not say too much! (laughs) \n \nIn the first dialogue \u2013 \u2018race\u2019 is co-constructed as quite straightforward by both Richard and myself: people \nlook different, have a different colour, have a different accent and so are not \u201cthe same as us\u201d. In the \nsecond dialogue the contradictions of racism are more apparent. Simultaneous, potentially contradictory \nclaims are brought out as we collectively a) construct racism is \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201chorrible\u201d, resulting in people \nfeeling \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cscared\u201d and b) maintain a (racialised) distinction between the English and others, \nasking about \u201cthe girl from Pakistan\u201d, asserting protection from racism as English and depicting the \nEnglish as \u201cstronger\u201d. Hence racism is simultaneously rejected as \u201chorrible\u201d and upheld in claims about \nthe significance of difference. The final sentence conveys this ambivalence: \u2018race\u2019 is real as people \u2018are \ndifferent\u2019, but you need to be careful about how far you claim or defend this difference.  \n \nAs Verkuyten and Thijs (2002) have discussed, ethnic minority groups are often constructed as a \nhomogenous category. Here, children with heritage from outside England \u2013 including Colombia, Italy, \nLebanon, Pakistan, Trinidad even Ireland - were generally put into the singular category of different: \u201cnot \nlike us\u201d and \u201cnot belonging here\u201d. This uniform category, applied to all children seen as different, was \nanchored in two key images: \u2018the Indian\u2019, as we saw above, and, predictably, black skin. Hence the racial \nother is \u2018found out\u2019 and fixed by the colour of his or her skin (Fanon, 1952)11 . As Jessica (British \nPakistani, aged 10) describes:  \n                                                 \n11 This relates to Fanon\u2019s concept of epidermalisation which \u201crefers to a historically specific system for making \nbodies meaningful by endowing them qualities of \u2018colour\u2019. It suggests a perceptual regime in which the racialized \nbody is bounded and protected by enclosing skin. The observer\u2019s gaze does not penetrate that membrane but rests \nupon it and, in doing so, receives the truths of racial difference from the outer body\u201d (Gilroy, 2004, p. 46). \n 12\nJessica: They say to us something about \u2018your colour\u2019 \u2013 and say to our friends they will catch our \ncolour. They say that they will start to be black too. They say they DON\u2019T want to be black! \nThey say that we look really ugly and so will our friends. How our hair is really ugly and \neverything.  \n \nThe quote from Jessica illustrates how she and her friends are treated differently because of her \u201ccolour\u201d \u2013 \nand that her white friends navigate the dangers not only of being different and ugly by association, but \nalso of actually catching \u201cour colour\u201d. This connects to racist images of blackness anchored in allusions to \ncontagion, pollution and danger. It suggests that friendship networks may be subtly policed (by children \nand adults) to maintain essentialised categories and protect whiteness by prohibiting \u2018mixing\u2019 with non-\nwhite children. However, as I observed in the playground and as Jessica and her friends argue, there are \nchildren who choose to ignore the surveillance of their friendships and hence challenge the construction of \nracialised identities as exclusive and uniform. \n \nJust as there are multiple ways of constructing and negotiating \u2018race\u2019, friends Tak (English Colombian, \naged 11) and Mark (Bangladeshi, aged 11) assert that not all comments about \u201ccolour\u201d are intended to be \noffensive or harmful. This extract comes after an account of racist abuse they experienced at a birthday \nparty from a white boy called Timothy:  \nAuthor name:  So why are people like that, like Timothy, why is he like that? Why are people racist?  \nMark: Cos they are just jealous of our colour.  \nTak: That is what some people say in my area, to cheer us up. That \u2018don\u2019t worry, they are just jealous, \nthey just want to be your colour\u2019.  \nMark: Like my mum says, \u2018if someone calls you a racist name, don\u2019t listen to them, they just want to be \nyour colour \u2013 and you have a lovely colour\u2019.  \nTak: There is this policeman who is from Cornwall who lives in our area, he is always cheering us up, \nhe says \u2018oh people are just jealous because they are not your colour\u2019. So the whole area, sticks up \nfor everyone. Our whole street sticks up for me and him. But some people ARE really racist.  \n \nWe can see here how I (unintentionally) introduce an individualising account of racism \u2013 perhaps inviting \nthe conclusion that \u201csome people are really racist\u201d while others may \u201cstick up\u201d for you, as Tak said. \nDespite my commitment to examining the dialogic and social production of racist discourse (following \nCondor, 2006), I have found that such common-place individualising representations of racism permeate \n 13\nthe research dialogues. Across the data there were many similar quotes to that above containing the idea \nthat \u201ccolour\u201d is something white people envy \u2013 both as individuals and as a group. Many of the children \nwho had received comments about their skin colour had been told by adults that this was because whites \nwere jealous of them.12 What is significant here, in the experiences elicited by the vignette, is that even \nwhen they are depicted as \u201clovely\u201d, \u201chaving such a nice tan\u201d \u2013 they are collectively still fixed by the \ncolour of their skin. They are thus restricted by the racist gaze \u2013 that makes white skin simultaneously \ninvisible and normal.  \n \nHaving said that, some white skin is in fact seen and marked by its association with difference and \nforeignness - for example, children with heritage from Italy and Portugal (who looked white) identified \nstrongly with accounts of racism. More common still were constructions of the Irish as other, very salient \nin the children\u2019s stories of racism in the school13, although there are extremely few pupils with Irish \nconnections. What is revealing here is that even the racialised whites are literally seen as different. As \nracialisation is located on the body, white Irish children in the school (who I could not see as different to \nthe white English children), were seen to look different, as Richard (white British, aged 8) asserts in \nresponse to my question: \nAuthor name:  So, when people pick on people because they look different, or sound different \u2013 have \nyou seen that happen at this school?  \nRichard: No not really, but my friend comes from Ireland. And he got picked on cos he looks different \nkind of thing.  \n \nHence \u2018race\u2019 becomes something that you can see, hear, touch - even smell.14 While I was careful not to \nequate \u2018looking different\u2019 and \u2018race\u2019 in the vignette and so invite a naturalising representation of \u2018race\u2019, \nthis connection is in fact implied in my question. Thus racialised difference becomes something that is \n                                                 \n12  There are traces in these quotes of Fanon\u2019s (1952) conceptualisation of the ambivalent racist gaze that \nsimultaneously rejects, fears and desires the racialised other. \n13 Research by Connolly (1998) into racism at school produced similar findings.  \n14 Richard also states that he does not believe one of his friends is Romanian, as his friend claims, and asserts that he \nis Indian \u2013 saying \u201cI recognise the smell \u2013 because most Indian people eat curry all the time \u2013 so they smell\u201d. This \nshows how racial difference can also be made in realms where no visual \u2018other\u2019 body is present. \n 14\nnon-negotiable and naturalised because it is seen in or on the body. However, as we have already observed, \nthis simplistic representation of \u2018race\u2019 is often contested in participants\u2019 narratives.  \n \nContesting \u2018race\u2019:  \u201cyou have to be hardcore\u201d  \nAs we have seen, \u2018race\u2019 is both accepted and contested. In this section we see that \u2018race\u2019 is depicted as an \nunwelcome imposition, something that is constructed and has detrimental consequences. This is apparent \nin the discussion between myself and friends Jessica and Cathleen (both British Pakistani, both aged 10). \nThis extract comes after we have discussed the vignette and after Jessica shares her experiences of racist \nbullying at school (discussed below).  \nAuthor name: Cathleen \u2013 have you ever seen anything like that? \nCathleen: No \nAuthor name: Have you seen anything that you would say was racist?  \n(Long pause.) \nCathleen: Well, it\u2019s not very nice. You hurt other people\u2019s feelings.  \nAuthor name: So if someone said to you \u2013 what is racism? What would you say? \nJessica: I don\u2019t think I know.  \nCathleen: I think it is when people bully you because they don\u2019t like your colour. \nJessica (speaking quickly): Some people say to us \u2013 \u2018where do you come from?\u2019 \nCathleen: Like they think we are from Africa or something. And we didn\u2019t come from there. My \nparents came from Birmingham. Some say a lot of weird stuff just because we look different. \nBirmingham is not that different. I don\u2019t like it when they say \u2018where are you from\u2019.  \n \nIt is possible to say that these girls are refusing to be fixed by \u2018race\u2019: they reject the idea that they are \ndifferent, they reject the anchoring of this difference in associations to Africa and they reject the racialised \nimplication that they do not belong \u2013 and so constantly need to answer the question \u2018where are you from?\u2019. \nThey, like other participants, described how it is was not simply individual children or adults who \nimposed difference on them: they spoke angrily of how the school as a whole could work in ways that \nmade them feel different from the school community. For example, after a discussion about her \nexperiences of racism at school with Kelley (white British, aged 11), Tonia (British Pakistani\/Muslim, \naged 12) says that \u201cnasty\u201d comments are tolerated in ways let racism and Islamophobia go unchallenged:  \nTonia: Cos there was this time when I brought the Koran in, well a translation \u2013 so that the others \ncould learn something about me. And Sharon was really nasty to me about it \u2013 and I was like \n\u201cit\u2019s my religion\u201d. Then the teacher says \u2013 \u201cif she has any nasty comments about it \u2013 say it to \n 15\nherself, keep it to herself\u201d. That is just really dumb! I think to show her that it is really wrong \u2013 \nshe should have been excluded (suspended or expelled). Because if you are teaching children \nnot to be racist, you have to be hardcore to show them what will happen if they are racist. You \ncan\u2019t just say \u201ckeep it to yourself\u201d! \n \nDespite the fact that research discussions with the staff at this school indicate that they were consciously \ncommitted to an effective anti-racist policy, we see how both anti-racism and racism nevertheless affect \nthese children\u2019s understanding of school policies and practices. Chelsea (Portuguese-Lebanese English, \naged 10) gave another example of how teachers may sometimes reject or dismiss experiences of racist \nname-calling and aggression, stating that teachers \u201ccall us tale-tells and stuff \u2013 and say that we are lying\u201d. \nThis does not necessarily indicate that individual teachers are actively racist and resisting the general ethos \nof the school (though this is of course a possibility). Rather it exposes the insidious nature of racism, as a \nhegemonic representation deeply engrained into cultural and institutional practices (Connolly, 1998; \nHowarth, 2004) \u2013 even contexts and relationships where racism is explicitly rejected (Billig, 1995; \nWetherell and Potter, 1992). It also suggests that the school is successful in its aim to educate pupils about \nracism, and hence the children\u2019s resistance can be read as both a reaction to racialised practices and as a \nproduct of an institutionalised culture of anti-racism. The stories reveal a mature understanding of racism \nas a collective and institutional practice \u2013 as the children describe how particular versions of events may \nbe questioned, marginalised and silenced quite subtly and how school practices may (inadvertently) locate \nthe problem of racist bullying with the racialised other.  \n \nFor instance, Jessica (British Pakistani, aged 10),  told a story of being called a \u201cblackie\u201d, being pulled to \nthe ground by her hair and then getting a detention herself \u201cfor causing trouble\u201d.  The implication is that if \n\u201cpeople went to schools where everyone was the same colour then there wouldn\u2019t be problems\u201d as Laura \n(white British, aged 8) puts it. Hence racism can be seen as \u2018the fault\u2019 of the racialised other. In this way, \nthe \u2018other\u2019 comes to embody danger; after a long discussion about the racist bullying they have \nexperienced Sophie (Italian English, aged 10) and Chelsea (Portuguese-Lebanese English, aged 10) \nexplain to me how sitting next to racialised others in class could be constructed as inviting \u201ctrouble\u201d.  \n 16\nAuthor name:  So is there racism in this school? \nSophie: Yeah \u2013 lots. Lots yeah. The English people, yeah \u2013 like \u2018look at you - smelly\u2019, or \u2018you are \nreally ugly\u2019. And when they touch someone they will \u2018oooh! I touched her! I need to wash my \nhands!\u2019 And all that stuff. It\u2019s like no one wants to sit next to them or anything. Also \u2013 like they \ndon\u2019t want to get into trouble.  \nChelsea: The teachers say that too: don\u2019t sit next to her \u2013 you will only get into trouble. \n \nJust as Jessica described how \u2018race\u2019 could be caught (p. 13), here \u2018race\u2019 is seen as trouble \u2013 and so trouble \ncan also be caught from the racialised other.  On the one hand we could say that these stories illustrate \nhow institutionalised practices may work to underplay the gravity of racism, to exclude the voices and \nexperiences of children constructed as \u2018other\u2019 and so maintain the racialised operation of power at \nschool15. And yet we also must to acknowledge the context of the production of knowledge, and see that \nthe school\u2019s explicit focus on anti-racism has furnished pupils with a critical awareness of the operation \nand complexity of racism \u2013 understanding its negative impact in society generally and on interactions \nwithin the school, the management of racist bullying and violence and on themselves.  \n \nIndeed, one of the most poignant aspects of the ways that the children problematised racism was in \nresponse to my questions on \u2018how racism made them feel\u2019. Their accounts suggest that representations of \n\u2018race\u2019 penetrate and potentially damage their sense of self, belonging and security (see also McKown, \n2004). They spoke of being \u201cashamed\u201d of their identity and wanting to change aspects of themselves that \nmarked them as different \u2013 wanting to \u2018pass\u2019 as Goffman would say. For instance \u2013 children spoke about \nchanging their names or accents that would indicate their association with \u2018other\u2019 cultures. As common \nresearch practice participants were asked to give a pseudonym for use in the writing up and presentation of \nthe data. It is significant that even children who were vocal about the \u201cstupidity\u201d of racism chose a name \nthat could appear to be \u2018typically white British\u2019 \u2013 such as Jessica, Cathleen, John or Mark - to replace their \nown names that could indicate non-white British parentage16. Predictably but sadly these children also \n                                                 \n15 For a more detailed study of the subtle dynamics of racialised exclusion at school see Howarth (2004) and \nLanghout and Mitchell (2007).  \n16 It is important to stress that the selection of pseudonyms was done at the start of the research activity, and so they \nwere not influenced by my choice of names or the characters of Sarah and Faranaz in the vignette.  \n 17\nspoke about wanting to change skin colour, revealing the devastating psychological as well as physical \nviolence of racism 17. They spoke of unhappiness, feeling alone, being scared and angry. Garth (aged 10) \nwhose Roma identity made him vulnerable to racist comments from both adults and pupils, described how \nthis made him feel:  \nAuthor name:  Ok \u2013 and how do you think that racism makes people feel? \nGarth: Alone \u2013 like they have been chucked down a massive hole and they are in a bottomless pit.  \nAuthor name:  Is that how it makes you feel? \nGarth: Yeah \u2013 most of the time. They make me feel like I don\u2019t belong and am not welcome. I just \nfeel different. \n \nThe emotive layers of this extract are lost in transcription and it is easy to dismiss its psychological weight. \nSitting with Garth, however, and having observed his loneliness at school over a period of months, it was \npainful to hear such a young child express the debilitating effects of prejudice and to wonder how deeply \nthe stories elicited across the study resonated for other participants. Towards the end of the research \nactivity with Kelley (white British, aged 11), Tonia (British Pakistani\/Muslim, aged 12) told us that:   \nTonia: I heard this story about this little girl. She was only very, very young. I think it was a long \ntime ago. She had had a lot of racism bullies picking on her, calling her names, throwing stones \nat her. So she was really, really sad. She decided that she wanted to be white. She killed herself.  \nAuthor name:  Did she? Where was that?  \nTonia: I don\u2019t know. It was somewhere here, but a long time ago. Anyway, she wanted to be white \nso she threw a pot of white paint on herself and it didn\u2019t work. So she cut her wrists. They did \ntake her to hospital \u2013 but she died anyway. So the racists \u2013 they killed her. It was really, really \nsad.   \n \nTonia\u2019s story contains the pain of not being able to control how one is seen, the imposition of difference \nand a rejection of self. We see here the \u201cpsychic violence caused by the internalisation of racisms and \nfeelings of powerlessness\u201d (Archer and Francis, 2003, p. 402). Little, it seems, may have changed since \nthe time of the Clarks research in 1930s USA:  \n\u201cAlmost nowhere in the larger society do minority children find their own dignity as human \nbeings respected or protected. \u2026 Understandably they begin to question whether they \nthemselves and their group are worthy of no more respect from the larger society than they \n                                                 \n17 The children know that racists \u201ccan rape you, or even kill you\u201d (Cathleen, British Bangladeshi, aged 10) and \nacknowledge their own vulnerability to such hostilities. Another child implied that his father had been a victim of \nracist murder.  \n 18\nreceive. These conflicts, confusions and doubts give rise under certain circumstances to \nself-hatred and rejection of their own group\u201d  \nClark, 1963, p. 64.  \n \nThis shows us that what is potentially damaging about racialising representations, is not simply the \ncontent of such, but the actual processes of objectification and essentialisation that denies the racialised \nother agency and self-determination. As John 2 (Muslim, aged 10) asserts, rejecting racist representations \noutright is simply not possible:  \nJohn 2: The thing is about racism \u2013 if you are called black \u2013 you can\u2019t change that. If you are called \nfat \u2013 you can go to Weight Watchers, if you are called black there is nothing you can do \u2013 \nexcept maybe go for skin surgery, plastic surgery. But I am not sure that people would want to \nnot that, if they are happy, just because other people are racist.  \n \nIn saying this, both John 2 and Tonia (above) are contesting the fixity of the racist gaze. While we do have \nto recognise that their identity and esteem, as others in the study, is marked by the racist gaze, in telling \ntheir stories they problematise \u2018race\u2019, disrupt its gaze and so rupture its hold over their own identities. The \npsychological damage of racism is then an important but partial aspect of the children\u2019s experience. While \nit is true that representations can \u201cconstrain and narrow the possibilities of human action\u201d (Jovchelovitch, \n1996, p. 122), this is only a part of the story. For while the children speak of wanting to change, wanting \nto be white and wanting to belong in a way that the essentialism of \u2018race\u2019 does not allow, they also speak \nwith anger of resistance and of strategies to undermine the technologies of racism.  \n \nThese examples bring to light the creative and collaborative ways the children and I manipulated \nrepresentations that race in order to challenge and resist the racist associations and practices that invade \nand restrict our social relationships and self-identities. Problematising the operation of racism in these \nways disrupts the \u2018reality\u2019 and fixity of racialised difference. When debated, contested and rejected, as we \nhave seen here, racism cannot have the weight and psychological impact that it had when \u2018race\u2019 is \nconstructed as natural, real and essential. We can see this dialogic character of racism, in this discussion \nbetween Matthew, John (both white British, aged 9) and myself, early in the research activity: \n 19\nAuthor name:  So why did the other girls (in the story) pick on Faranaz? \nMatthew: Because of her accent. \nJohn: And she has a weird name. \nAuthor name:  Aha. So why does that make some people pick on her? \nJohn: Um, because they sound funny.  \nMatthew: They sound funny to them \u2013 but they don\u2019t inside, they don\u2019t sound funny to the person \nwho is making it.  \nJohn: And they are different to the other people.  \n \nWhat is interesting is that when John asserts that difference is real (\u201cthey are different\u201d, \u201cfunny\u201d and \n\u201cweird\u201d), Matthew qualifies this, depicting racialised difference as a product of one\u2019s perspective. So it is \nnot that \u201cthey\u201d are naturally different, but \u201cthey\u201d appear to be different to others. Matthew also talked \nabout the bullying he had received because of his \u201cginger\u201d hair, and it is possible that these experiences \nhave made him more reflective about the operation of bullying than John.18  \n \nA rather hopeful conclusion \nIt can come as no surprise that non-white children who have direct experience of racism have the \nunderstanding and the motivation to challenge the ideological production of \u2018race\u2019 (McKown, 2004). \nWhat is interesting is that there are white children such as Matthew whose own experiences of bullying \n(being \u2018ginger\u2019 or overweight), experiences of racialisation (being white Irish, Italian or Roma), \nexperiences of witnessing racism towards their friends or significant others (such as football heroes and \nother celebrities) and participating in cooperative activities in mixed groups appear to have given them the \nsocial psychological tools with which to problematise racist discourses and practices (as other research has \nfound: Aboud and Fenwick, 1999; McGlothlin and Killen, 2005; Nesdale et al, 2005). It is not, then, only \nchildren who are positioned as racialised others who challenge racist thinking (as McKown and Weinstein, \n2003, have assumed). And it is neither a matter of situating individual children as producers, carriers or as \nvictims of racist discourse. This reading falls into the trap of locating racism as \u2018the problem\u2019 of certain \nindividuals (Wetherell and Potter, 1992). The children\u2019s stories reveal that racism and anti-racism are \n                                                 \n18 As McKown and Weinstein (2003) have highlighted, \u201cstereotype consciousness might be necessary for children \nfrom nonstigmatised groups to develop a personal commitment to racial tolerance\u201d (p. 512). \n 20\nbetter understood as dialogic social representations, used by the same participants (myself included) in \nquite contradictory ways. Hence, we cannot position people as \u2018more\u2019 or \u2018less\u2019 able to contest the \nrepresentations that race, but we need to see the dialectic between reified and contestory representations \nof \u2018race\u2019 more as a product of the dynamics of dialogue, identity, context and school culture.  \n \nWhat this demonstrates is the importance of context, dialogue and debate: without such we would not \nencounter alternative positions, other ways of being and new ways of questioning (Markov\u00e1, 2003). \nWithout relationship and dialogue we would not develop resistant identities, counter-arguments and \n\u201cnarratives of survival, \u2026 narratives of how individuals have managed to turn their negative experiences \ninto useful social and cultural capital\u201d (Rastas, 2005, p. 158). The research activity invited such a dialogic \nand argumentative approach to \u2018race\u2019 \u2013 bringing out contradiction, ambivalence and resistance to \u2018race\u2019. \nMoreover, the general ethos of the school, apparent in school assembly and classroom discussions, \nadvocating tolerance, respect for different perspectives and anti-racism, is likely to have played a \nsignificant role in the problemisation of \u2018race\u2019 in the research narratives. Importantly, such discussions \n(within the context of the school generally and the research activity in particular) may enable pupils not \nonly to engage with the other, but also to engage with discourses, representations and practices that other. \n \nArguably one could say that some academic constructions of racial categories mirror everyday beliefs \nabout \u2018race\u2019 and social categories in general \u2013 often essentialising and reifying \u2018race\u2019. Indeed, essentialism \nhas been found to play a crucial role in prejudice from the early, foundational studies of Allport (1954) \nand Sherif (1948), and recently Condor et al (2006) and Verkuyten (2003a). Medin and Ortony (1989) \ncoined the term \u2018psychological essentialism\u2019 to refer to the belief among laypeople that many social \ncategories have essences. Rothbart and Taylor (1992) also assert that people often treat social categories \nas if they are natural kinds and use bodily features as evidence of the \u2018naturalness\u2019 of gender and \u2018race\u2019. \nHirschfeld (1996) argues that this is actually an innate process, a \u2018human kind module\u2019: a distinct \ncognitive system that attributes essences to social categories, exemplified in his own work on \u2018race\u2019. In a \n 21\nthoughtful paper by Haslam et al (2000) they suggest that we need to combat essentialism in everyday \nthinking by \u201creducing the reification of the category in question by showing its internal diversity, its \nsimilarity to and overlap with other categories, and its lack of any underlying distinctiveness\u201d (p. 125).  \n \nMy argument is that this is precisely what we need to do in our research practice. If Hirschfeld is correct \nin his belief that we are cognitively predisposed to essentialise social categories, and if we accept that \nthere is no essential basis to the concept of distinct racial groups, then we need to be vigilant against this \ntendency to essentialise, reify or naturalise \u2018race\u2019 in all areas of interaction including our professional \npractice. \n \nAs Gilroy (2004) discusses, racism is often studied in terms of fixity - its continuing hold over the ways in \nwhich we categorise others and ourselves (e.g. Durrheim and Dixon, 2005; Verkuyten and Thijs, 2002). In \nthis paper I have attempted to provide a strong critique of the ways in which such research can, often \ninadvertently, reify representations that race and so help to make ideologies of \u2018race\u2019 meaningful. This is \nnot a new criticism, but I am unaware of psychological research that attempts to look at the production of \n\u2018race\u2019 in the actual process of doing (one\u2019s own) research19. While Social Psychology has played a central \nrole in demonstrating the debilitating damage that racism causes the human psyche, we also need to \nexplore the conditions for problematising and transforming representations that threaten to limit or \nfracture the possibilities of self and so move towards a \u201csystematic denaturing of race\u201d (Gilroy, 2004, p. \n63).  \n \nIn fact this lofty objective resonates with early Social Psychological theory and research (e.g. Katz and \nBraly\u2019s work on \u2018racial stereotyping\u2019 and the Clarks\u2019 work on segregation in education) where the Social \nPsychological consequences of racism were exposed and, to a limited extent, challenged (Richards, 1997). \n                                                 \n19 For an excellent text on the \u201cpolitical and methodological danger of an unproblematized reliance upon categorical \napproaches to \u2018race\u2019\u201d relevant to the social sciences as a whole, see Gunaratnam (2003, p.73).  \n 22\nHowever, it is not simply a critical analysis of racism that I advocate, but a critical analysis of \u2018race\u2019.  This \nis a significant difference. What I offer is a theoretical and a methodological departure: a focus on the \ncollective production of \u2018race\u2019 and on the role of context, dialogue and debate in maintaining, reifying and \nchallenging \u2018race\u2019 as a meaningful concept and a consequential social practice. This is examined a) within \nthe stories given by the participants of their everyday experiences and b) within the context of the research \nencounter itself. \n \nIn this project, not only do we see that the children challenge racism as a \u201cstupid\u201d, imposed construct, but \nmore importantly we see that they may reject \u2018race\u2019 and so reject particular identities imposed on them \nand their friends and thereby create new ways of being seen, being identified and being connected. This \nanalysis demands that they are seen as active agents in the (re)production and transformation of \nrepresentations that race. One of the youngest white boys in this study (Richard, aged 8) said that \u201cI hope \nwe won\u2019t have to understand racism one day\u201d. While this can be interpreted in many ways \u2013 a possibility \nis that he hopes one day racism will have lost its grip on our collective psyche, ways of seeing each other \nand positioning ourselves.  This would allow us to see \u2018race\u2019 as the \u201ccomplex, unstable product\u201d of racism, \nrather than as it is often understood \u201can eternal cause of racism\u201d (Gilroy, 2004, p. 16). So rather than focus \non a Social Psychology of \u2018race\u2019 or even racism, I suggest we need to assert a Social Psychology of \nracialisation and resistance \u2013 and to explore our collective role in its production and defence.  \n \nWhile I agree with Fuss\u2019 point that \u201cany critical position which successfully deconstructs \u2018race\u2019 as an \nempirical fact but fails to account for its continuing political efficacy is ultimately inadequate\u201d (1989, p. \n91), I nevertheless suggest that if Social Psychology is to contribute to anything beyond maintaining the \nsignificance of racism in social cognition, subjectivity and cultural practices, it is precisely to these very \nhopeful moments of problematising both \u2018race\u2019 and racism in the everyday and in the context of doing \nresearch that we need to attend. As Fuss advises, we need to \u201cwork with \u2018race\u2019 as a political concept \n 23\nknowing it is a biological fiction\u201d (ibid) in the process of designing, analysing and disseminating research \non \u2018race\u2019.  \n \nThis would compliment recent work that examines precisely discourses that race: how these are \nconstructed, embodied and sometimes contested, such as the seminal work by Billig (1995) on nationalism, \nAugoustinos et al (1999) on racist discourse and Condor (2006) on racist talk. For a rigorously Social \nPsychology, we must examine these discourses and practices at both an individual and a collective level, \nas Rosenberg has argued:  \n\u201ca truly integrative social or political psychology must take this complex relationship \nbetween the individual structuring of meaning on the one hand and action on the other \nhand and the collective structuring of meaning and action on the other as its point of \ndeparture\u201d  \nRosenberg, 2003, p. 434.  \n \n \nIn this research I emphasise the collective structuring of meaning by examining the context of the \nproduction of knowledge (both in terms of the culture and practices of the school and in terms of the \nresearch itself) and the dialogic and argumentative character of representations that race.  What is original \nand hence challenging in this project is my focus on the collaborative construction, reification and \ncontestation of \u2018race\u2019 between myself as researcher and the young participants. Boldly, perhaps, I would \nsuggest that Social Psychology must play more attention to the social construction of \u2018contact\u2019 and \nracialised categories, examine how these historical legacies continue to inform implicit assumptions \nwithin research designs and so expose the subtleties of racism within the institutionalised practices of \nacademic research. For if we do not, we shall continue Psychology\u2019s history of engagement with \u201cforms \nof knowledge production that invariably supported stereotypical notions of \u2018race\u2019\u201d (Stevens, 2003, p.191) \nand so continue to produce a racialised framework where racism\u2019s logic is defended and extended.  \n \nAcknowledgements: \n 24\nThis research benefited from scholarly suggestions from many colleagues.
