In a more general sense, within the whole review and future applications of it, \nthe purposes of such an approach are to identify how such constructions work, what \nclaims are being made, and how different rhetorical constructions of creativity might \nhave differing impacts on pedagogic strategies in relation to literacy, arts projects and \nmedia education. More narrowly, this article aims to summarise the rhetorics and their \nmajor concerns, while considering how selected ones might apply to an instance of \nmedia literacy. This is an exemplary instance only, using the work of two Year 8 students \n(12 years of age) from an English\/Media course on comicbook superheroes.  \n \nWe situate our discussion in contexts ranging from the affordances of technology, play, \ngames, politics and popular culture to value judgements made in formal and informal \neducational settings. Initially we distinguish ten rhetorics, which are summarised in \nrelation to the philosophical or political traditions from which they spring. Our list is \nneither exhaustive nor fully representative of historical interest in this subject but has in \ngeneral been gleaned from the contemporary work of those with some interest in \n\u2018learning\u2019, broadly conceived. We have left out, for instance, rhetorics of creativity that \ncover global political processes and economic critiques, as well as a rich literature on \nreligion and creation. The discussion then returns to a number of key rhetorics \u2013 play, \ntechnology, the creative classroom and social critique \u2013 which have most relevance for \nunderstandings of literacies and the way in which these are nurtured, encouraged and \nexpressed in different social settings.  \n \nThe Rhetorics of Creativity \n \nWe begin with the rhetoric which could be said to have the oldest provenance and to \nhave remained resilient, albeit in more subtle guises, within educational practices \nrelating to literacy in the 20th and 21st century: Creative Genius. This is a romantic and \npost-romantic rhetoric that dismisses modernity and popular culture as vulgar, and \nargues for creativity as a special quality of a few highly educated and disciplined \nindividuals (who possess genius) and of a few cultural products (Simonton, 1999; \nScruton, 2000). Culture in this rhetoric is defined by a particular discourse about \naesthetic judgment and value, manners, civilization and the attempt to establish literary, \nartistic and musical canons. It can be traced back through certain aspects of the \nRomantic period to aspects of European Enlightenment thought, in particular Kant\u2019s \nCritique of Judgment (1790), sections of which explore themes relating to aesthetic \njudgment, notions of genius and question the necessity that objects of \u2018beauty\u2019 should \nhave actual \u2018purpose\u2019. \n \nIn contrast, providing an explicitly anti-elitist conceptualisation of creativity as inherent in \nthe everyday cultural and symbolic practices of all human beings, is a rhetoric relating to \nDemocratic Creativity and Cultural Re\/Production. This rhetoric, most familiar in the \nacademic discipline of Cultural Studies, sees everyday cultural practices in relation to \nthe cultural politics of identity construction. It focuses particularly on the meanings made \nfrom and with popular cultural products. This rhetoric provides a theory derived from the \nGramscian perspective on youth sub-cultures developed by the Birmingham Centre for \nContemporary Cultural Studies. It constitutes practices of cultural consumption \n(especially of films, magazines and popular music) as forms of production through \nactivities such as music sampling and fan activity; and thus belongs to an influential \nstrand of cultural studies which attributes considerable creative agency to those social \ngroups traditionally perceived as audiences and consumers (Willis, 1990).  \n \nSimilarly democratic, but without the basis in cultural politics, is a rhetoric of Ubiquitous \nCreativity. Here, creativity is not just about the consumption and production of artistic \nproducts, whether popular or elite, but involves a skill in terms of responding to the \ndemands of everyday life. To be more creative, in this discourse, involves individuals \nhaving the flexibility to respond to problems and changes in the modern world and their \npersonal life (Craft, 1999). While much of the writing in this rhetoric is targeted at early \nyears education with the aim of giving young children the ability to deal reflexively and \nethically with problems encountered during learning and family life, examples used to \nillustrate \u2018everyday creativity\u2019  include attempts by working-class individuals or \nimmigrants to find jobs against the odds without becoming discouraged. \n \nThe rhetoric of Creativity for Social Good sees individual creativity as linked to social \nstructures. This rhetoric is characterised by its emphasis on the importance for \neducational policy of the arts as tools for personal empowerment and ultimately for \nsocial regeneration (NACCCE, 1999). It stresses the integration of communities and \nindividuals who have become \u2018socially excluded\u2019 (for example by virtue of race, location \nor poverty) and generally invokes educational and tangentially economic concerns as \nthe basis for generating policy interest in creativity. This rhetoric emerges largely from \ncontemporary social democratic discourses of inclusion and multiculturalism. Similarly, \nthe future of a competitive national economy is seen to depend, in the rhetoric of \nCreativity as Economic Imperative, on the knowledge, flexibility, personal \nresponsibility and problem solving skills of workers and their managers (cf. Scholtz and \nLivingstone, 2005). These are, apparently, fostered and encouraged by creative \nmethods in business, education and industry (Seltzer and Bentley, 1999). There is a \nparticular focus here on the contribution of the \u2018creative industries\u2019, broadly defined, \nalthough the argument is often applied to the commercial world more generally. Again, \nthis rhetoric annexes the concept of creativity in the service of a neo-liberal economic \nprogramme and discourse (Landry, 2000). \n \nA persistent strand in writing about creativity, the rhetoric of Play and Creativity turns \non the notion that childhood play models, and perhaps scaffolds, adult problem solving \nand creative thought. It explores the functions of play in relation to both creative \nproduction and cultural consumption. A related rhetoric of Creativity and Cognition can \nbe seen as two quite different traditions. One includes theories of multiple intelligences \n(Gardner, 1993) and the testing of mental creativity levels (cf. Cropley 2001), and \nexplorations of the potential of artificial intelligence to demonstrate creative thought and \nproduction. Its emphasis is on the internal production of creativity by the mind, rather \nthan on external contexts and cultures; although Gardner\u2019s position is, of course, more \ncomplexly situated than this. The other consists of more culturally situated notions of \ncreative learning expounded by Vygotsky (1998); we return to these ideas in coming \nsections. \n \nIf creativity is not inherent in human mental powers and is, in fact, social and situational, \nthen technological developments may well be linked to advances in the creativity of \nindividual users. The rhetoric constructed around The Creative Affordances of \nTechnology covers a range of positions from those who applaud all technology as \ninherently improving to those that welcome it cautiously and see creativity as residing in \nan as yet under-theorised relationship between users and applications. This rhetoric is \ncharacteristic of contemporary constructivist discourse in the field of education. \nPertinently for those interested in literacy teaching, placing itself squarely at the heart of \neducational practice, The Creative Classroom rhetoric focuses on pedagogy, \ninvestigating questions about the connections between knowledge, skills, literacy, \nteaching and learning and the place of creativity in an increasingly regulated and \nmonitored curriculum. The focal point of this rhetoric is frequently practical advice to \neducators in both formal and informal settings about ways of encouraging and improving \nthe learning of young people. This rhetoric locates itself in pragmatic accounts of \u2018the \ncraft of the classroom\u2019, rather than in academic theories of mind or culture. Setting a \nchallenge to aspects of foregoing rhetorics, Creative Arts and Political Challenge sees \nart and participation in arts education as politically challenging, and potentially \ntransformative of the consciousness of those who engage in it; and it describes the \nprocesses of institutional pressure that militate against positive and challenging \nexperiences of creativity by young people, regardless of the efforts of teachers and \npractitioners.  \n \nScanning across the rhetorics outlined, while the idea of creativity may be seen to be as \ncomplex, varied and contradictory as its current use in education at least in the UK is \nwidespread, it is possible to see both connections and contradictions between different \nrhetorics. Creative Genius and Democratic Creativity and Cultural Reproduction, for \ninstance, share a focus on the appreciation, aesthetics and production of cultural \nartefacts and art, broadly defined; while rhetorics of Ubiquitous Creativity, Social Good \nand the Economic Imperative all place the supposedly creative power of individuals \n(whether, as learners, workers or citizens) at the centre of attempts to overcome \npersonal and social problems. Rhetorics addressing cognitive, social and play theories \nas well the creative potentials of technology share an emphasis on questions about the \nrelationship between users and tools, prior knowledge or skills and innovation. Aspects \nof the Creative Classroom, meanwhile, share with Creative Arts and Political Challenge, \nan interest in pedagogic and political critique, destabilising and questioning not the \nprinciples of democratic views of creativity but the institutional and social contexts within \nwhich creative literacies (verbal, visual or mediated) are acquired and transformed.  \n \nSo where does this leave us as literacy educators and researchers? While this article \nattempts to categorise the discourses associated with 'creativity' in different contexts, \nand in so doing acknowledges that both the contexts and discourses are sometimes \noverlapping, the term is still often used in a vague, ill-defined way, either because users \nconsider it to be self-explanatory or because it is invoked to add lustre and a \u2018feel-good \nfactor\u2019 to processes or aspects of pedagogy at risk of sounding dry and technological. \nThis is particularly the case with the whole subject of literacy. On the one hand, instead \nof acknowledging that literacy is itself not singular and monolithic but diverse, culturally \nsituated and mediated, it has sometimes been taken for granted at a policy level that \n\u2018creative\u2019 or \u2018playful\u2019 activities cannot improve children\u2019s literacy to the extent that \ndecontextualised cognitive tasks and daily drills can. On the other hand, academic \ncommentators on creativity do not necessarily take up distinct and defined positions with \nregard to pedagogy and literacy. Indeed, arguments in favour of the testing of creativity \noverlap with those against such evaluation. And those arguing against skills based \napproaches in the English classroom may argue the virtues of technical literacy in Media \nStudies or ICT. In these circumstances, it is important to show the contexts within which \nrhetorical claims about creativity are being made and the purposes served by their use. \nIt is similarly important to outline the alliances between sometimes apparently antithetical \nrhetorics and to identify the ones that are generally missing from educational debates. \nThis is what we try to do in our section on creativity and learning. \n \n \nCreativity and Learning  \n \nWhile a number of current approaches to play and creative learning come from the \nperspective of cognitive science with a concomitant emphasis on the rigour of \npsychometric scales and inter-cognitive tests (Cropley, 2001; Carruthers, 2002) some \ncognitivist approaches to play do share the emphasis of the \u2018Creative Classroom\u2019 \nrhetoric on the importance of divergent thinking. Sandra Russ, for instance, argues that \n'[p]lay has been found to facilitate insight ability and divergent thinking' (2003: 291), and \nthat 'theoretically play fosters the development of cognitive and affective processes that \nare important in the creative act' (2003: 291). Challenging a mainstay of the economistic \nconceptualisation of creativity, she sees children as being excluded by definitions of \ncreative products as effective, novel and valuable.  \n \nRuss argues that the ways in which children use language, toys, role plays and objects \nto represent different things in play are habitual ways of practising divergent thinking \nskills. Accounts such as these raise questions for those interested in creativity, literacy \nor the links between them. For example, there is widespread concern (cf. Brennan, \n2005; Maisuria, 2005) about the way in which childhood pretence and play are being \nsqueezed out of the school curriculum to be replaced by the learning of rules and \nappropriate roles, rote literacy tasks and an approximation of \u2018adult\u2019-type problem solving \ntasks. Alpesh Maisuria argues powerfully that the interventions of recent governments in \neducation have created a culture of \u2018vocationalisation\u2019, \u2018standardization\u2019 and \u2018rubber \nstamp\u2019 testing which has all but killed the space for creative pedagogy, playful \nexploration and creative work in the classroom.  \n \nIn intra-cognitive perspective \nMany cognitive accounts of play and creative learning tend, however, to overlook the \ncultural and social contexts of learning. By contrast, the developmental psychologist Lev \nVygotsky\u2019s essay on play (in Vygotsky, 1978) proposes essentially the same framework \nfor play as he does for learning in general, and learning about language in particular: \nthat play, like any form of symbolic action, involves the social use of tools for making \nmeaning: resources endowed with meaning by the imaginative work of the user, such as \na broomstick which in play might become a horse. The emphasis here is less on the \ninternal mental mechanisms of play, imagination and learning, and more on how \nimaginative and playful processes are negotiated with others through external resources. \nIn his essay on creativity in adolescents (1998), Vygotsky presents play as a necessary \npre-cursor to creativity proper, arguing that in early adolescence, the imaginative work of \nplay is complemented by processes of rational thought. Creativity in its mature form \nconsists of both imaginative and intellectual effort. In our own research, this framework \nhas been used to consider what kind of creativity might be at work in teenagers\u2019 design \nof computer games, where the cultural experiences of games are transformed by the \ndesign of a playful experience, involving both rule-governed systems of conditionality \nand imaginative constructions of narrative space (Burn and Durran, 2007). \n \nFor us, this has helped to clarify how games can be used in education in relation to \nmedia literacy, and helped us to move away from simplistic notions of play and creativity \napparent in contemporary debates about the educational value of new technologies such \nas computer games. A persistent contradiction that runs through these debates is \nbetween the desire by educators to recuperate games as a form of safe, socially \nprogressive activity, conducive to learning and development; and play as a more chaotic, \nsubversive, even dangerous activity (cf. Sutton-Smith, 2001). Indeed, the creative \npotential of computers, the internet and new multimedia visual authoring software \npackages are sometimes taken for granted and at others challenged by those who view \nthe increased use of technology as a threat to literacy and creativity, and as embodying \na variety of risks for children. But just how are notions of creativity linked to technological \nchange in this rhetoric?  \n \nThe creative affordances of technology? \nIn their trenchant critique of the use of information and communication technology by \nchildren, Cordes and Miller assert that \u2018a heavy diet of ready-made computer images \nand programmed toys appear to stunt imaginative thinking [\u2026] children in our electronic \nsociety are becoming alarmingly deficient in generating their own images and ideas\u2019 \n(2000: 4). In contrast, supporting Avril Loveless\u2019s socially situated view of the potentially \ncreative uses of new technologies (1999, 2003) in their riposte to Cordes and Miller, \nDouglas Clements and Julie Sarama (2001) cite studies that document what they call \n\u2018increases in creativity\u2019 and as well as better peer relations following interactive \nexperiences with certain computer programmes. However, like Scanlon et al (2005), \nthey also note that many computer programmes designed to increase children\u2019s \nknowledge and skills are not in the least bit creative, relying on rote learning, repetition \nand drill exercises. Thus they argue that computers can, but do not necessarily, support \nthe expression and development of creativity. As Sefton-Green (1999) argues, ultimately \nthe social contexts of digital technology\u2019s use may help or hinder its creative potential.   \n \nIn a similar vein, but with different conclusions, the largest study to date of the use of \ndigital video in the classroom (Reid et al, 2002) found that while teachers generally \nperceived creativity (and the benefits of digital technology) as a liberation from \nconstraint, convention and teacher-directed work, the most media literate work \ndeveloped from close attention to the language of the moving image, and carefully-\nstructured tasks. It concluded that creative work in this medium proceeds not from the \ntechnology itself but from awareness of the cultural properties of the medium, and from \nspecific pedagogic practice. More generally, educational practice is very often situated \nbetween the extremes of \u2018elite\u2019 and \u2018democratic\u2019 views of creativity and the aims, \nrhetorics and practices of individual schools, or educators may be positioned at various \npoints on the spectrum. They are then pulled in different directions by a number of \nfactors which might include policy imperatives such as social inclusion or provision for \nthe \u2018gifted and talented\u2019 as well as the need for a school to bid for funding and compete \nfor pupils. These issues are often related to forms of cultural politics, either explicitly or \nimplicitly. Depending on the motives of policy makers or educators, the creative work of \nyoung people may be planned as, or retrospectively interpreted as, a form of political \nintervention, or, conversely, as an aesthetic exercise, a means for jazzing up a \u2018dull\u2019 \nliteracy driven curriculum.  \n \nNo room for critique?: learning, creativity and institutional settings \nThe National Curriculum in Action website for promoting creativity (published by QCA), \nfor example, defines creativity as it is put forward in the National Advisory Committee on \nCreative and Cultural Education report (NACCCE 1999): creativity is imaginative and \npurposeful, and produces original and valuable outcomes. Unfortunately, much of the \npolicy literature on this subject begs a number of crucial questions: would teachers need \na \u2018creativity make-over\u2019 if not constrained by imperatives relating to assessment, \ntimetabling and school management? Do the products of either formal or informal \ncreative projects for youth have to be pro-social in their outcomes and abide by \ninstitutional constraints? And what happens to them when they do not? What then of \nformal contexts within which creativity is invited to play a part in improving literacy and \nlearning \u2013 do these discussions take on board the necessity for contextual learning, for \ndiscussion, debate and challenge?  \n \nIn its most positive incarnation, the \u2018Creative Classroom\u2019 rhetoric may be seen to \npromote forms of learning that are generally held to improve the experience of children \nin education \u2013 holistic learning, active learning, expanded notions of intelligence, \nattention to social and cultural contexts, social learning and ethical human development \n(Beetlestone, 1998; Starko, 2005). By the same token, though, it runs the risk of losing \nwhat is distinctive about \u2018creativity\u2019 itself \u2013 if it cannot be distinguished from all these \nother things, where is its explanatory power? Additionally, in some formulations, process \nand product are set up as being in opposition to each other, rather than as in dialogue \nand this in turn leads to a seriously problematic relationship between creativity and \nevaluation, and creativity and critical literacy practice.  \n \nFrom David Buckingham\u2019s point of view (2003), rhetoric about creative classrooms takes \non a different character when consideration is given the actual contexts of teaching \nwhere there is an increasing pressure to \u2018deliver\u2019 manageable chunks of literacy in the \ncurriculum and to the construction of the \u2018teacher\u2019 as someone who has yet to acquire \nthe skill of creativity via contact with practitioners from the arts or media. In this context, \nthe critique by Patricia Thomson and her colleagues of the conduct, experience and \noutcomes of one arts project and its various implications for the everyday life of an \nordinary primary school makes worthwhile reading (Thomson, Hall and Russell, 2005). \nIn the instance examined, the thought-provoking writing and performance of the children \nwhich take place via contact with a dramatist in a Midlands primary school are effectively \ncensored by the head teacher for fear that their sardonic, satirical or dark ideas about a \nmodern educational community will undermine parents\u2019 faith in the school, offend \nvarious members of the school community and cause a scandal in the press. The bits of \nthe children's work with the artist\/writer in residence that are most creative and \nchallenging are those that cause the most conflict.  \n \nFor Thomson and Hall (2005, 2006), in current educational policy around creativity, the \ntransformative potential of involvement in creative work is marginalised in favour of \u2018a \nrelatively weak form of social inclusion\u2019. To them, it is divergence and challenge, rather \nthan the ability to successfully negotiate everyday life that is at the heart of creative \nendeavour. But how viable is such a definition for most educators in formal settings, and \nespecially for children, whose work is most vulnerable to censorship? And how does this \nnotion of challenge and transformation relate to aspects of the curriculum that involve \nboth the \u2018consumption\u2019 and the \u2018production\u2019 of mass media cultural artefacts? We \nattempt to address these questions at least tangentially in our following section via an \nexploration of the subversive media work of two twelve year old students set within the \ncontext of a broader overview of current discussions of media literacy and creativity.  \n \n \nCreativity and Media Literacy \n \nAttention to creativity within the related domains of media education and media literacy \nhas grown as the emphasis has shifted from the analysis of media texts to the \nproduction of media texts, made possible by the advent of digital authoring tools for \nmoving image media, website production (Abbott, 2001), and even computer games \n(Burn, 2007a and b).  While a concern with representation and identity and the ways in \nwhich these are embedded or creatively inflected in textual practices has long been a \nconcern of those writing about Critical Literacy (cf. Janks 1993), recent models of media \nliteracy have included references to creativity: for instance, the UK regulator OFCOM, \nwhich has a remit to promote media literacy, has adapted an earlier notion (Aufderheide, \n1997) in their model of \u2018Access, Understand, Create\u2019. A rather different emphasis is \nsuggested by a model currently being explored among European media literacy \nspecialists, which sees media literacy as cultural, critical and creative. However, the \nexact nature of the ideas of creativity invoked in these models has often remained \nvague. At its most reductive, it may simply mean that children and young people are \nmaking or producing content. Elsewhere, the creative process is defined in terms of \nother functions it may serve, such as developing a conceptual understanding of how \nmedia texts are structured, or simulating the production processes of media industries.  \n \nHowever, media education research which draws on the tradition of Cultural Studies \noffers more useful accounts which relate creative production work to identity \nconstruction. Buckingham and Sefton-Green (1994), for example, present an account of \nyoung people\u2019s creative media work in school in which such work provides opportunities \nfor the exploration, negotiation and transformation of identity. This kind of argument, \nespecially when rooted, as it is here, in empirical study, is close to the \u2018grounded \naesthetic\u2019 of the young people studies in Willis (1990); to Vygotsky\u2019s notion of the way \ncreative work transforms the creator; and to Bruner\u2019s notion of identity as distributed and \nnegotiated through the use of cultural resources. All three of these theoretical \nperspectives allow literacy researchers and practitioners to relate young people\u2019s \nproduction of their own media texts to notions of identity. From Willis\u2019s perspective, such \nwork is grounded in aesthetic tastes and productive work using the resources of popular \nculture. From the Vygotskyan perspective, media production work both uses cultural \nresources and semiotic tools, and, like any creative work, transforms the user in some \nway. Meanwhile, Bruner\u2019s conception of distributed identity allows us to see how creative \nwork externalizes aspects of human identity, making them visible in the form of media \ntexts and events to other members of the community, and inviting response and \nengagement. \n \nPlayful syntheses, critical play: children making comics \nFor the purposes of teasing out some relationships between media literacy and \ncreativity, then, the most productive approaches to invoke are likely to be the culturalist \nand cultural psychology approaches. These have the advantages of emphasising \ncultural contexts and resources, of theorising the social development of identity, and of \nproviding a dialectical account of how imaginative work, play, and intellectual \ndevelopment together make up the creative process. In addition, this combination of \napproaches offers ways to think about dissident and creative literacies, ways in which \nchildren\u2019s and young people\u2019s interpretation and production of meaning in their own and \nother media texts might engage with forms of cultural politics, and construct imaginative \ncritiques of aspects of their social world. \n \nINSERT FIGURE 1 HERE \n \nINSERT FIGURE 2 HERE \n \nWe will briefly discuss two examples. Figures 1 and 2 show two comic strips made by \nYear 8 children (12-13 years old) in a comprehensive school in Cambridge, UK.  They \nwere made as part of a media course about comic strip superheroes, which analysed \nsuperheroes past and present, in print, animation and live action film; and then asked \nstudents to invent their own. In terms of media education and literacy, this kind of \nproduction by school students can be seen in the context of current debates about \nmultimodality and the literacy curriculum (eg, Bearne, 2004; Burn and Durran, 2007).  \n \nThe first image shows Sophie\u2019s super-heroine, Tigerwoman. Sophie\u2019s written \ncommentary shows that Tigerwoman is a consciously feminist construction. It also \nreveals that her alter ego is a disabled girl in a wheelchair, who dreams Tigerwoman in \nher sleep at night. While Sophie herself was not disabled, she was very shy, and our \nreading of the disability was, we believe plausibly, as a metaphor for her shyness. While \nit is possible that this image could be read as irony or humour, the plausibility of this \ninterpretation is supported by both the teacher\u2019s close knowledge of her as a pupil and \nby her own discussion of her comicstrip. Her visual design shows both Tigerwoman and \nher mortal enemy as visibly sexualised female figures, with body-hugging costumes, \npronounced curves, elaborate make-up (nail varnish, lipstick, eye-shadow), and, in \nWolf\u2019s case, an exposed navel.  \n \nThe social purpose of this seems to be an exploration of aspects of sexual identity \nexpressed in dress and makeup codes in ways not open to Sophie in her own life, a \nprojection of, or at least experimentation with, more risky attributes than she can adopt in \nher own body. This kind of aspirational play with gendered identity may be a familiar idea \n(Willett, 2006), but the question here is: what does it mean to describe it as creative? To \nstay with our notion of media literacy, it is first of all culturally creative, in that it gathers \nsignifiers from media sources (superhero comics) and from tween girl-culture (makeup, \ndress codes, nails), and combines them. This operates as an imaginative act but also as \nan intellectual act, which proposes a form of identity, but also an emphasis on female \npower not common in this genre.  \n \nThe other comic strip shows Claude\u2019s superhero, the Toaster. Again, creativity consists \nof an imaginative inventiveness which takes cultural resources from conventional \nelements of superhero design \u2013 the hyper-delineated musculature and dynamic panels \u2013 \nand combines them with signifiers from a quite different provenance \u2013 the domestic \ntoaster \u2013 to represent a new idea. In this case, however, another set of cultural \nresources is employed \u2013 visual signifiers from a different comicstrip tradition best \nrepresented by the scatological British comic Viz, and present in Claude\u2019s design in \nelements such as comically bulging eyes and puffs of smoke shooting from the ears of \ncharacters in distress. \n \nIn these respects, Claude\u2019s design exemplifies Vygotsky\u2019s model of imaginative work: \ncultural resources pulled from the memory, and transformed through recombination, a \nprocess of meaning-making in which the tools are both the reworked images and the \nmaterial tools of inscription (in this case, pencil crayons). However, as in Sophie\u2019s \ndesign, this work is also intellectual. It does not represent directly aspects of identity, as \ndoes Sophie\u2019s Tigerwoman; rather it represents forms of cultural taste, in a sophisticated \ncritique of conventional comicbook superheroes. The dullness of Superman is \nlampooned in Toaster\u2019s enemy, Really Quite Strong Man, whose name and visual \nattributes (ludicrously square jaw) transform the conventional signifiers of the DC comics \nfor parodic purpose. In this combination of rational thought and imaginative recreation, \nClaude\u2019s work, like Sophie\u2019s, exemplifies the criterial features of mature creativity as \nVygotsky sees it in early adolescence (1998). \n \nIn the media literacy work of both students, then, creativity can be seen in terms of the \nimaginative transformation of (popular) cultural resources coupled with intellectual \npurpose. At the same time, this kind of work can be viewed from the perspective of \nCultural Studies, as an example of the kind of \u2018grounded aesthetic\u2019 conceived by Paul \nWillis. The link between these two perspectives is provided by Vygotsky, whose model of \ncreativity emphasises the centrality of cultural resources. To make a connection of this \nkind is problematic for Cultural Studies, which is traditionally hostile to accommodations \nwith psychological research and theory. However, there are useful precedents, for \ninstance in the work of Buckingham (2003), which uses Vygotsky to provide a theory of \nconcept formation linked to the kinds of cultural pleasures and social motivations typical \nof Cultural Studies perspectives.  \n \nFrom this point of view, then, it is significant that the cultural context and provenance of \nthese students\u2019 comicstrips is the landscape of popular culture, part of the cultural capital \nof these students. In relation to media literacy, this work is, then, cultural and creative in \nits context and its resources; but also in its social function, which is to project aspects of \nidentity: in Sophie\u2019s case, an exploration of risky but appealing constructions of \nfemininity; in Claude\u2019s case, an expression of cultural taste and judgment. Both pieces \nare also critical: they critique the representations of gender in comicstrip superhero texts, \nin Sophie\u2019s case by creating a powerful superheroine and villainess; in Claude\u2019s, by \nsending up the square-jawed, muscle-bound masculinity of the male superhero.  \n \nA final question might be: what are the implications for teachers of the kinds of creativity \nand media literacy described here? Firstly, it is clear that this kind of literacy work needs \nto be closely attentive to the cultural resources children might draw on \u2013 to make \nopportunities for these to be recalled, presented, manipulated and played with. \nSecondly, the intellectual and critical aspects of this literacy has involved the explicit \nteaching and learning of conceptual ideas \u2013 the representation of gender in comicstrips, \nfor instance \u2013 and the visual grammar of this genre. Thus the young people\u2019s media \nproductions can be viewed contextually as interpretive and transformative, culturally \n\u2018scaffolded\u2019 by pre-existing forms and ideas but creating specific critical vocabularies or \nimages. \n \nThe use of popular cultural genres and texts is important, then \u2013 to make the most of \nstudents\u2019 experience in developing critical attitudes and protocols, teachers need to use \nthe expertise of students in the cultures which surround them. At the same time, \neducators and researchers need to think hard about what creativity means here, and \nwhat kinds of transformations are possible, achievable, desirable or indeed are in the \ninterests of developing critical understanding but also in the interest of making new \nrepresentations which students find pleasurable, culturally authentic, and challenging. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nCreativity itself has been subject to a range of competing definitions in recent years. \nSuch definitions are, however, insufficiently precise to avoid familiar binary oppositions \nand contradictions in this area which construct creativity as, respectively elite or \ndemocratic; originating from nothing or generic and transformative; spontaneous or \ntaught and learnt; universal or culture-specific; imaginative and intuitive or knowledge \nand skills-based; ineffable and instinctive or quantifiable and testable. These seeming \noppositions are linked to a number of critical questions that cut across the rhetorics \noutlined at the opening of this article, which we have posed but not answered. For \ninstance: how can cultural consumption be connected to \u2018creative\u2019 production? How \nsignificant is play as a component of creativity? What counts as evidence of creativity in \nbroadly educational settings? And what is the difference between \u2018good\u2019 pedagogy and \n\u2018creative\u2019 pedagogy?  \n \nThis article has raised questions about how creativity that is seen to be potentially \ndisruptive and anti-social, politically challenging or problematic can retain these \nimportant aspects in highly controlled institutional settings. It has argued that rhetorics \nabout Creativity and Play and the Creative Classroom can contribute substantially to \ndebates about literacies and learning, especially where lessons about the cost of \ndivorcing knowledge and skills from social contexts, processes from products and \nrational thought from fantasy play are heeded. Educational work with young people \u2013 \neven that which acknowledges literacies as multiply sited \u2013 may well wish to build in \nbeside the more formal learning objectives, significant amounts of time for playful \nexploration of and engagement with \u2013 and by corollary enjoyment of \u2013 language, media, \nideas, artefacts and materials. Additionally, it becomes apparent through a closer look at \ndiscourses of creativity which appeal to the potentials of technology that wider social \nconcerns are never far from the minds of those who work with children and technology \nand that these concerns can lead in several directions. This leads for some to uniform \napproval and enthusiasm about information and communication technology\u2019s innate \ncreativity; for others to a wholesale rejection of the notion that any technology can be \ncreative; and for yet others to the need for an understanding of technological potential in \ngiven social, cultural and psychological circumstances. In our own sphere of work, we \nhope to have demonstrated that media literacy as evidenced in the production work of \nchildren can be viewed as creative and also culturally challenging in quite specific ways. \n \nExemplifying the necessity for a sharp and consistent categorisation of the rhetorics of \ncreativity and the connections and tensions between them, it seems clear, from the \nexamples used in this article, that media literacy researchers and educators are likely to \nfind certain rhetorics of creativity more useful than others. They are unlikely to find \nnarrowly congnitivist perspectives which focus on the internal mechanisms of the brain \nuseful, especially where these are divorced from considerations of cultural context. Elitist \nand economistic constructions, of \u2018creative genius\u2019 and \u2018creative imperative\u2019 respectively, \nare equally unlikely to provide insight into the playful and critical appropriation by \nchildren of popular cultural artefacts. By contrast, researchers and practitioners are likely \nto find culturalist perspectives valuable. However, as indicated above, the use of aspects \nof cultural psychology, in particular, Vygotsky\u2019s dialectic between intellectual activity and \nfantasy play, allows a quite specific understanding of how cultural resources such as \npopular media products may be transformed in the creative act by adults or by children.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nIn formulating the rhetorics that appear here, we acknowledge the contribution and critiques of \nDavid Buckingham, Julian Sefton-Green and Ken Jones, as well as the interest and funding of \nCreative Partnerships, UK. \n \n \n \nBibliography \nAbbott, C.
