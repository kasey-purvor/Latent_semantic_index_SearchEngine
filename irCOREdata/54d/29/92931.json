Genuine saving is a measure of net investment in produced, natural and\nhuman capital. It is a necessary condition for weak sustainable development that genuine\nsaving not be persistently negative. However, according to data provided by the World\nBank, resource-rich countries are systematically failing to meet this condition. Alongside\nthe well-known resource curse on economic growth, resource abundance might have\na negative effect on genuine saving. In fact, the two are closely related, as future\nconsumption growth is limited by insufficient genuine saving now. In this paper, we\napply the most convincing conclusion from the literature on economic growth \u2013 that it\nis institutional failure that depresses growth \u2013 to data on genuine saving. We regress\ngross and genuine saving on three indicators of institutional quality in interaction with\nan indicator of resource abundance. The indicators of institutional quality are corruption,\nbureaucratic quality and the rule of law. We find that reducing corruption has a positive\nimpact on genuine saving in interaction with resource abundance. That is, the negative\neffect of resource abundance on genuine saving is reduced as corruption is reduced.\n1. Introduction\nGenuine saving (hereafter GS) is an established measure of weak sustain-\nable development. Weak sustainable development is built on the assump-\ntion that different forms of capital are substitutable for each other\n(Neumayer, 2003).1 Development is unsustainable if an economy\u2019s total\nstock of capital is eroded, which, for instance, will occur if the GS rate is\n(persistently) allowed to drop below zero. Since GS was developed, the\nWorld Bank (2004) has made retrospective calculations for more than 150\ncountries between 1970 and the present day. Although it finds that global\n\u2217 Corresponding author. Phone: 0207-9557598.

Significantly, these countries are also often resource-rich.\nThis observation is strongly reminiscent of the so-called \u2018resource\ncurse\u2019 hypothesis in the economic growth literature: the phenomenon that\nresource-rich economies generally grow more slowly than resource-poor\neconomies. Indeed, the two phenomena are linked: first, current genuine\nsavings should in theory be equal to growth in the present value of future\nwell-being along the optimal growth path of the economy, even though\nempirical evidence does not fully fit the theory (Ferreira and Vincent, 2005;\nWorld Bank, 2005). In other words, countries with poor GS performance\nshould also perform poorly in terms of future economic growth. Second,\nresource-abundant countries with slow growth in the past and negative GS\nare unlikely to be able to sustain even their comparatively small increases\nin income into the future.\nThe resource curse represents a puzzle since the free gift of nature\nin the form of natural resource deposits should be a blessing, not a\ncurse to the economy. Unsurprisingly, the resource curse on economic\ngrowth has generated a substantial literature over the past half-century\nor more. Many explanations have been put forward and one can\nbroadly distinguish between more directly economic explanations and\npolitical-economic explanations that highlight the role of policy and\/or\ninstitutional failure. Ultimately, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that\nit is political-economic failures that have been the root cause of slow\ngrowth. We draw succour from this finding and examine whether low GS\nrates in resource-rich countries can similarly be explained by particular\npolitical and institutional failings. More specifically, we test whether\nimproving institutional quality in selected, distinctways leads resource-rich\ncountries to invest their resource rents more sustainably in other forms of\ncapital.\nAtkinson and Hamilton (2003) have made a useful first attempt to\naddress these issues. They provide tentative evidence of an interaction\nbetween a composite index of general institutional quality, also used by\nSachs and Warner (1995), and resource abundance in determining gross\nsaving\/investment: resource-rich countries with good quality institutions\nhave enjoyed greater rates of gross investment and saving. We build\non Atkinson and Hamilton\u2019s (2003) research in several ways. First and\nforemost, we test whether this interaction holds for genuine saving as well\nas gross saving\/investment. Secondly, we test whether specific aspects of\ninstitutional quality are more significant than others in driving up GS. We\nexamine three indicators of institutional quality to assess which aspect of\ninstitutional quality it is that matters most: corruption, bureaucratic quality\nand the rule of law. Thirdly, whereas Atkinson and Hamilton (2003) use a\ncross-section of period-average data, we use a panel of data spanning up to\n115 countries and 18 years. This allows us to estimate the interaction with\nmore sophisticated econometric techniques that allow for country-specific\neffects, which are likely to be correlated with both resource abundance and\ninstitutional quality, and that allow for dynamic effects. Ourmost important\nresult is that resource-rich countries suffer from low GS rates, but that they\nEnvironment and Development Economics 35\ncan improve their performance by fighting corruption, difficult as this may\nbe in actuality.\nSection 2 explains GS in more detail, and outlines the empirical finding\nthat resource abundance is negatively related to GS. Section 3 discusses\nthe resource curse in terms of the growth literature. Section 4 explains our\nempirical strategy, section 5 outlines our results and section 6 provides a\ndiscussion.\n2. Genuine saving and resource abundance: the unsustainable\nconsumption of resource rents\nThe origins of GS can be traced back to the work of Solow (1974) and\nHartwick (1977),whowere concernedwithmaximising intertemporal social\nwelfare in an economy exploiting a non-renewable resource. Given a range\nof simplifying assumptions,2 this is realised through an optimal mix of\nconsumption and investment. Total investment across the economy is the\nsum of net changes in the capital stock valued at its shadow price. If\nGS is persistently below zero, then the economy is certainly not weakly\nsustainable (Hamilton and Clemens, 1999). The World Bank calculations\nof GS, which it now calls \u201cadjusted net saving\u201d, includes three forms of\ncapital: produced, natural andhuman.GS is computed as follows (appendix\nI provides more details):\nGS= investment in produced capital\u2212net foreign borrowing\n+net official transfers\u2212depreciation of produced capital\n\u2212net depreciation of natural capital+ current education expenditures\nWorld Bank GS estimates for the period 1970\u20132001 have shown significant\ndifferences from country to country. One important trend to emerge is that\nresource-rich countries are the poorest genuine savers (see also Atkinson\nand Hamilton, 2003). Figure 1 plots period-average GS rates (that is, GS\ndivided by gross national income) against resource abundance for 145\ncountries. Resource abundance is measured as the average share of fuel\nand mineral product exports in total exports.\nWith the exception of Algeria and Guinea, for whom GS was just above\nzero for the period 1970\u20132001, every country with an average share of\nfuel and mineral exports in total exports of over 60% had negative GS. In\ncontrast, most resource-poor countries, especially the cluster of countries\nwith an average share of fuel and mineral exports in total exports of under\n20%, had positive GS. In Sub-Saharan Africa, it must also be said that net\nproduced capital investment is often negative too. In other words, the total\n\u2018man-made\u2019 wealth of these countries is also decreasing, and the World\nBank\u2019s estimates of net natural capital depreciation simply worsen the\nsituation. This is the case in Guinea-Bissau, for example. Nevertheless, one\nimportant conclusion we can draw from the World Bank\u2019s data is that the\ncountries with the greatest natural resource extraction are also the poorest\nperformers in terms of GS. Put another way, they are failing to invest a\n2 See Dietz and Neumayer (2004).\n36 Simon Dietz et al.\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nResource abundance: share of exports of fuel and mineral products in total exports (%)\nG\nen\nui\nne\n s\nav\nin\ng \n(%\nG\nN\nI)\nSaudi Arabia\nAzerbaijan \nZambia \nNigeria\nAlgeria\nIran \nVenezuela \nBahrain \nSingapore \nGuinea \nOman\nGuinea-Bissau \nFigure 1. Resource abundance and genuine saving between 1970 and 2001 (data from\nWorld Bank 2004)\nsufficient proportion of their resource rents into other forms of capital.\nThis is striking, because it bears a considerable similarity to arguments\nmade with respect to the effect of natural resource intensity on economic\ngrowth.\nIt is important to note that the method the Bank applies to estimate\nnet depreciation of natural capital (price minus average cost times\namount of resource extraction) is likely to over-estimate the true extent\nof depreciation in countries with a large stock of remaining resources\n(Neumayer, 2000, 2003). This is because contrary to, for example, the user-\ncost approach of the El Serafy (1981) method, it does not acknowledge\nthat resource extraction carries an element of both capital depreciation and\ntrue income. However, lack of reserve data prevents us from adjusting\nthe GS figures and whilst the data published by the Bank are likely to\nover-estimate natural capital depreciation and therefore under-estimate\nGS rates in resource-rich countries, it is our view that the main result on\nthe interaction between institutional quality and resource abundance is\nunlikely to change in qualitative terms if a different method for calculating\nnatural capital depreciation is used. One would have to be concerned\nif the extent of under-estimation of GS were systematically correlated\nwith institutional quality, but we see no reason why this should be the\ncase.\n3. The \u2018resource curse\u2019 hypothesis and policy failure\n\u201cOne of the surprising features of economic life is that resource-poor\neconomies often vastly outperform resource-rich economies in economic\ngrowth\u201d (Sachs and Warner, 1995, p. 2). Instances of this can be found\nthroughout modern history, but it is especially true of the post-1970\nperiod. Between 1970 and 1993, per capita GDP in resource-rich countries\ngrew around three times slower than it did in resource-poor countries\nEnvironment and Development Economics 37\n(Auty, 2001). Perhaps this is because resource-abundancemasks underlying\ntrends in other determinants of economic growth such as trade policy and\ngovernment efficiency. However, Sachs and Warner (1995) demonstrated\nthat, even after controlling for these factors, resource-abundance is\nnegatively related to growth. The phenomenon has become known as the\n\u2018resource curse\u2019.\nThe fact that fuel and mineral-rich economies perform especially badly\nin relation to resource-poor economies (Auty, 2001) is a paradox. On the\nface of it, countries with abundant fuel and mineral resources ought to be\nable to sustain rapid growth both in the short and medium-term, as long\nas they invest the proceeds of their resource windfalls in other productive\nforms of capital. A number of explanations for the resource curse have been\nput forward. We are especially interested in these, because they may help\nto cast some light on the causes of insufficient GS in resource-rich countries.\nA popular explanation surrounds the poor economic performance of\nthe natural resources sector \u2013 characterised by falling primary resource\nprices (Prebisch, 1962), vulnerability to short-termprice fluctuations (Sala-i-\nMartin andSubramanian, 2003) and relatively sluggishdemand\u2013 compared\nto the manufacturing sector. But we must ask why resource-rich countries\nhave not succeeded in diversifying? They ought to be able to invest their\nresource rents in other forms of capital, and lay the foundations for faster\nand sustainable growth.\nOne reason why they might not is the so-called \u2018Dutch disease\u2019,\nwhereby the discovery of new resource stocks leads the real exchange\nrate (or real wages) to over-appreciate, which perversely causes the\ntradeable non-resource sector to contract. Many economists believe that\nthe manufacturing sector (and indeed the service sector) produces more\npositive externalities than the natural resources sector (e.g. learning-by-\ndoing). Thus the contraction of the manufacturing sector in relative terms\ncoulddepress economic activity (Hirschman, 1958;Matsuyama, 1992). From\nan investment perspective, there may not be an incentive to invest in\nmanufactures under these circumstances. Resource-rich countries may also\nlack the incentive tomakeproductive investments inhuman capital through\neducational expenditure (Birdsall et al., 2001; Gylfason, 2001; Papyrakis and\nGerlagh, 2004a, 2004b). This may be connected to Dutch disease, insofar as\ncurrency appreciation may reduce the relative rate of return to educational\ninvestments.\nHowever, it seems plausible that it is a failure of public policy causing this\nunderinvestment. Judicious management of natural resource endowments\ncan prevent the generation of too much income too quickly. In Norway,\nfor example, the government takes around 80% of resource rents in taxes\nand fees and invests that amount in foreign assets (Gylfason, 2001). Either\ngovernmentswith abundant natural resources are blind to theneed to invest\nin produced and human capital because they see themselves in a \u2018comfort\nzone\u2019, or they may even deliberately neglect to invest. Either way, this\nleads us more generally to a political-economic explanation of the resource\ncurse.\nThe potential to \u2018cash in\u2019 on natural resourcesmay have an unsettling and\ninhibiting effect on a country\u2019s polity, leading to injudicious decisions on\n38 Simon Dietz et al.\nthe economy. The availability of resource rents may give rise to corruption.3\nThere are multiple reasons why corruption may in turn slow economic\ngrowth (Leite and Weidmann, 1999) by reducing investment and the\nproductivity of investment (Boycko et al., 1995; Mauro, 1995; Murphy\net al., 1993; Romer, 1994). Alternatively, Isham et al. (2003) have identified\nwider political-economic explanations for the resource curse. Firstly, the\nwhole statemay be subject to a \u2018rentier effect\u2019. Stateswith abundantmineral\nand oil reserves extract their revenues from resources that are concentrated\ngeographically and in terms of ownership. This reduces their incentive to\ndevelop the governance mechanisms that enable general taxation. On the\nopposite side, since the state sector tends to dominate, citizens have less\nincentive to form a healthy \u2018civil society\u2019, an independent middle class fails\nto develop, and technocratic and entrepreneurial talent remains captive\nof state largesse in terms of employment and advancement opportunities\n(Chaudhry, 1997). In addition, the government can rely on its resource\nrevenues to repress dissent, either throughbuyingoff opposition (oftenwith\nhigh-profile \u2018white elephant\u2019 infrastructure projects) or through violence.\nAs a result of this, democracy often fails to develop (Karl, 1997; Ross, 2001).\nMore importantly in this context, stifling technocratic and entrepreneurial\ntalent, as well as making unproductive \u2018white-elephant\u2019 investments, will\nharm the economy.\nSecondly, political elites find it relatively easy to control resources and\nmaintain their wealth in a point resource-led economy, but face the prospect\nof losing their grip through industrialisation and urbanisation (Acemoglu\net al., 2001; Moore, 1967). It follows that political elites in resource-rich\ncountries resist modernisation pressures for as long as possible, especially\ninvestment in the manufacturing sector. Again, in this case civil society\nfails to develop. The main reason for this is that the concentration of capital\nownership among political elites, together with production methods that\nfavour the use of expert (foreign) labour and that are capital-intensive (Auty\nand Kiiski, 2001), reproduces social inequalities between those inside the\nelite and those outside it.\nHence we are compelled to test whether the negative effect of resource\nabundance on GS is explained by policy failure. In particular, we specify\na model to explain GS based on the interaction between natural resource\nendowments and institutional quality. Atkinson andHamilton (2003) found\na significant positive interaction between resource abundance and general\ninstitutional quality on gross investment and saving. According to their\nresults, resource-rich countries with good quality institutions have enjoyed\ngreater rates of gross investment and saving. We extend their logic to\nGS and also test whether some elements of institutional quality are more\nimportant than others in explaining variations in GS. We test corruption,\nbased on the expectation that it will divert the proceeds of natural resource\nliquidation away from investment in produced and human capital towards\nconsumption. We also test measures of bureaucratic quality and the rule\nof law. Following Isham et al. (2003), we decline to apportion these three\n3 Known as rapacious rent-seeking behaviour (Lane andTornell, 1996; Torvik, 2002).\nEnvironment and Development Economics 39\nindicators to particular theories. Instead, we test whether it is indeed true\nthat these wider political economy effects depress GS, or whether it is\ncorruption in particular that matters.\n4. Empirical strategy\nWe model variations in rates of gross savings and GS in a panel of\ndata spanning up to 115 countries and 18 years. We specify a reduced-\nform model, with a particular focus on the interaction between resource\nabundance and indicators of institutional quality. It is ultimately GS that\nwe are interested in. However, we start with gross savings, since it is\ngross savings that \u201canchors\u201d GS and we want to investigate whether\nthe interaction between resource abundance and indicators of institutional\nquality impact the gross and GS rates differentially.\nDeterminants of (gross) saving\nWithin the last fifteenyears, a numberof studieshave analysed the empirical\ndeterminants of gross private or gross national saving4 using panel data\nand reduced-form models (Edwards, 1996; Dayal-Gulati and Thimann,\n1997; Loayza et al., 2000; Corbo and Schmidt-Hebbel, 1991; Masson\net al., 1995; Haque et al., 1999; Samwick, 2000). Across all studies, four\nvariables appear to have a robust and significant effect on gross saving:\n(i) per capita income, (ii) economic growth, (iii) age dependency and\n(iv) urbanisation. Income per capita and income growth have a positive\neffect on gross (private) saving. Age dependency has a negative effect on\ngross saving, and in the empirical studies, urbanisation tends to have a\nnegative effect on gross saving. A number of other variables are tested\nin the above studies. We choose not to include them for three reasons.\nFirstly, some are generally insignificant in the empirical literature. These\nincludemacroeconomic indicators such as interest rates and terms-of-trade.\nSecondly, data availability for some variables is very limited. These include\ndetailed indicators of financial liberalisation, social security systems and\nincome inequality. Thirdly, some are components of GS, and therefore\nincluding them as independent variables effectively constructs a partial\nidentity with the dependent variable. These include fiscal policy variables\nsuch as government consumption and fiscal surplus (see appendix I).\nHypothesis and data\nWe test the following two hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: Resource-rich countries have higher rates of gross saving and\nthe effect is stronger the better is institutional quality.\nHypothesis 2 (main hypothesis): Resource-rich countries have lower rates\nof genuine savings, but this effect is likely due to policy failure and raising\ninstitutional quality in these countries will lead to greater investment of resource\nrents in other forms of capital, and thus to higher rates of genuine saving.\n4 Where gross national saving = gross private saving + gross public saving.\n40 Simon Dietz et al.\nWe test these hypotheses with the following models\nGrossSRi ,t = \u03b1 + \u03b21 lnYi ,t + \u03b22Growthi ,t\u22121 + \u03b23Agei ,t + \u03b24Urbani ,t\n+\u03b25Insti ,t +\u03b26Rsi ,t + \u03b27Insti ,t \u2217 Rsi ,t + Tt + \u03b5i ,t (1)\nGSRi ,t = \u03b1 + \u03b21 lnYi ,t + \u03b22Growthi ,t\u22121 + \u03b23Agei ,t + \u03b24Urbani ,t\n+\u03b25Insti ,t + \u03b26Rsi ,t + \u03b27Insti ,t \u2217 Rsi ,t + Tt + \u03b5i ,t (2)\nfor country i at time t, where \u03b5 is an error term. The year dummiesT allow for\nglobal changes in the gross savings and GS rates over time not otherwise\naccounted for in the explanatory variables. GrossSR is the gross savings\nrate, GSR is the GS rate. Data are taken from the World Bank;5 lnY is gross\nnational income per capita. We take the natural log to account for positive\nskewness. Growth is GDP growth, which is lagged one year to mitigate\npotential endogeneity bias; Age is the age-dependency ratio: the ratio of\ndependants \u2013 people younger than 15 and older than 64 \u2013 to the working-\nage population (those aged 15\u201364); Urban is a measure of urbanisation: the\npercentage of the total population living in urban areas. Data for all these\nvariables are taken from the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators\nOnline database (World Bank, 2004).\nInst is institutional quality. We separately test three indicators of\ninstitutional quality. Indices of (i) lack of corruption, (ii) bureaucratic quality\nand (iii) the rule of law are taken from the International Country Risk Guide\n(ICRG). These are scaled from 0, which indicates poor quality institutions\n(i.e. the highest corruption, the lowest bureaucratic quality and the absence\nof rule of law) to 6, which indicates high quality institutions (i.e. the lowest\ncorruption, the highest bureaucratic quality and full rule of law).6 The\nindices are compiled in an attempt to assess the investment risk faced by\nmultinational companies and are based on expert judgements. Insofar as\nthey ought to be positively related to investment, they are promising for\nour purposes. Unfortunately, the ICRG variables are only available for the\nperiod 1984 to 2001.\nRs: Atkinson and Hamilton (2003) use the value of resource rents. We\ncannot take this measure since resource rents form part of GS and their\ninclusion would lead to a partial identity of the left-hand and right-hand\nsides of the estimating equation. Instead, we take the combined share\nof fossil fuel and mineral products in total exports as our measure of\nresource abundance (World Bank, 2004). This is similar to the measure\nused by Sachs and Warner (1995) in their seminal paper and the most\nwidely used measure in the literature on the resource curse. The difference\nis that we do not include agricultural products, the inclusion of which\nhas been widely criticised, as Sachs and Warner (2001) themselves admit.\nIdeally, one would want to measure resource abundance with measures of\n5 http:\/\/lnweb18.worldbank.org\/ESSD\/envext.nsf\/44ByDocName\/\nGreenAccountingAdjustedNetSavings\n6 Until 1996, bureaucratic quality was scored 0\u20134.We rescale this data to lie between\n0 and 6. However, none of the observations in our sample actually have a score of\nzero.\nEnvironment and Development Economics 41\nresource stocks, as others have noted before (Stijns, 2002; Bulte et al., 2005).\nHowever, no comprehensive data on resource stocks exist. Our expectation\nis that resource abundance as measured by the combined share of fossil\nfuel and mineral products in total exports will be negatively associated\nwith the GS rate. This effect could be partly due to the way the World\nBank measures GS. As mentioned already, in subtracting the full resource\nrents from gross savings, theWorld Bank employs a method for calculating\nthe value of natural resource stock depreciation that is likely to represent\nan over-estimate and is thereby under-estimating the GS rate in resource-\nabundant countries (see Neumayer, 2000, 2003). However, other methods\nof accounting for natural resource stock depreciation are contestable as\nwell and\/or are extremely data-intensive. For example, the El Serafy (1981)\nmethod requires information on resource stocks, which are difficult to\nget, as mentioned above. Importantly, our main hypothesis is that the\nnegative effect of resource abundance is moderated by the degree of\ninstitutional quality. For this conditional effect, the fact that the GS rate\nis likely to be under-estimated for resource-abundant countries should not\nmatter, unless the under-estimation were systematically correlated with\ninstitutional quality. We see no reason why this should be the case.\nlnY, Growth, Age, and Urban are the control variables. Inst, Rs and\nits interaction term are the main variables of interest. As noted above,\nwe expect Rs to have a negative effect on GS. However, if raising the\nstandard of institutions in resource-rich countries reduces the unsustainable\nconsumption of resource rents, then we would expect the interaction\nterm Inst\u2217Rs to be positive. Rs is the predictor variable and Inst is the\nmoderator variable, such that the negative relationship between resource\nabundance andGS becomesmore positive \u2013 i.e. improves \u2013 the better are the\npolitical institutions. Where the interaction term is significant, one cannot\ninterpret the coefficients on the individual components Rs and Inst in the\nconventionalway. Instead, the coefficient onRs in amodelwith a significant\ninteraction term Inst\u2217Rs is the slope of Rs on GS when Inst is equal to zero.\nEstimation strategy\nWe first estimate the model with fixed effects, a design that allows for\nunobserved time-invariant variation in country-specific factors, with robust\nstandard errors. Secondly, we estimate the model using the Arellano-\nBond linear, dynamic panel-data estimator (Arellano and Bond, 1991). This\naccounts for the inertia that is almost certainly present in the determination\nof saving rates (Loayza et al., 2000). The Arellano-Bond estimator is a\ngeneralised-method-of-moments (GMM) estimator. It is constructed by\nfirst-differencing the dependent and independent variables. Although the\nArellano-Bond estimator has advantages over a static fixed effects estimator,\nit also suffers from problems. First-differencing wipes out the country\nfixed effects, but the lagged dependent variable is by definition correlated\nwith the error term such that further lags of the dependent variable\nand first differences of the exogenous explanatory variables are used as\ninstruments. This leads to rather inefficient estimation with high standard\nerrors ifArellano andBond\u2019s (1991) one-step estimatorwith robust standard\nerrors is used. The two-step estimator is much more efficient, but can\n42 Simon Dietz et al.\nunder-estimate the size of standard errors in small samples. As a result\nof this, we report estimation results from both the one-step and the two-\nstep estimator. Moreover, whilst first-order serial correlation is expected,\nsecond-order serial correlation indicates that the original error term is\nserially correlated, which renders the estimations inconsistent. In all our\nestimations reported below we can reject the hypothesis of second-order\nserial correlation at conventional levels of significance.\nOne potential problem is that institutional quality might be endogenous.\nIn other words, while institutional quality affects the GS rate, the GS rate\nmight also affect institutional quality. In econometric terms, this would\nmean that institutional quality is correlated with unobserved variables\nthat enter the error term. As long as these unobserved variables are time-\ninvariant, this is not a problem sincewe use fixed-effects or first-differenced\nmodels. It is possible, however, that unobserved variables vary over time.\nIdeally, one would tackle this problem with the help of the instrumental\nvariables regression technique. The problem is that potential instruments\nsuch as geography and historical information on settlermortality suggested\nby the literature on the effect of institutions on growth are all time-invariant\nand are used in cross-sectional regression analysis (Acemoglu et al., 2001;\nRodrik et al., 2004; Glaeser et al., 2004). It is not possible to estimate a fixed-\neffects instrumental variable regression model with instruments that do\nnot vary over time and we believe that controlling for fixed effects is of\nparamount importance to our estimations.\n5. Results\nTable 1 reports summary statistics and a bivariate correlation matrix.\nAlthough the lack of corruption, bureaucratic quality and rule of law indices\nare all compiled by ICRG, the correlations between them are not especially\nhigh. In particular, the strength of correlation between lack of corruption\nand bureaucratic quality and between lack of corruption and the rule of law\nis only moderate (0.54 and 0.52 respectively). Therefore there may indeed\nbe a possibility of detecting different effects between the various measures\nof institutional quality and GS.\nTable 2 presents the static fixed effects estimations for the gross savings\nrate, with columns 1\u20133 reporting results for each of the three indicators\nof institutional quality. Looking initially at the control variables, GDP\ngrowth is a significant and positive determinant of the GrossSR in all\nmodels, whereas the age-dependency ratio and the urbanization rate are\nnegative determinants. Resource-abundant countries do not have higher\nrates of gross savings and there is no evidence for an interaction effect with\ninstitutional quality either in static estimation.7\nPerhaps this is because the static fixed-effects estimation does not take\ninto account the dynamics of savings behaviour. Table 3 reports the results\nof our estimations with the Arellano-Bond dynamic model.

The interaction between lack of corruption\nand resource exports (column 1) is positive and significant at the 5%\nlevel. The interactions between bureaucratic quality and resource exports\n(column 2) and between the rule of law and resource exports (column 3)\nare not statistically significant, however. There is no evidence here that\nimprovements in these aspects of the political economywill lead to a higher\nGSR.\nThe specific interpretation of the statistically significant interaction\nvariable between resource exports and the lack of corruption is that the\nnegative relationship between resource exports and the GSR diminishes \u2013\ni.e. becomes more positive \u2013 the less corruption there is. Reducing\ncorruption by one index point increases the slope of resource exports on\nthe GSR by 0.029 units. The coefficient on resource exports shows the slope\nof resource exports on the GSR at an index score of 0. Therefore, a one\npercentage point increase in the resource exports to total exports ratio leads\nto a decrease in the GSR of 0.28 percentage points in countries with themost\ncorruption. We can make use of the interaction-term coefficient to estimate\nthe slope of resource exports on the GSR at higher scores on the index.\nAt the mean corruption index score of 3.6, a one unit increase in resource\nexports leads to a decrease in the GSR of only 0.18 percentage points (0.28-\n3.6\u22170.029), and at the maximum index score of 6 (i.e. at the lowest level of\nEnvironment and Development Economics 47\ncorruption), a one unit increase in resource exports leads to a decrease in\nthe GSR of just 0.11 percentage points (0.28-6\u22170.029). Reducing corruption\nfrom the maximum to the minimum reduces the negative effect of resource\nabundance on the GSR by 61%.\nTable 5 reports the results of our estimations with the dynamic Arellano-\nBond model. Of the control variables, GNI per capita and urbanisation are\ninsignificant, GDPgrowth is significant andpositive,while age dependency\nis sometimes significant and negative. The resources export variable is\nnegative throughout and statistically significant with few exceptions. The\ninteraction effects between our institutional variables and resources exports\nare not significant in one-step estimation (columns 1a to 3a). However,\nboth the interaction effect between lack of corruption and resource exports\n(column 1b) and between rule of law and resource exports (column 3b)\nare positive and significant in two-step estimation. According to these\nestimations, for a one index point reduction in corruption, the slope of\nresource exports on theGSR increases by 0.023 units. The respective increase\nis 0.016 for a one index point improvement in the rule of law. When\ncorruption is at its highest \u2013 at an index score of zero \u2013 a one percentage\npoint increase in the ratio of resource to total exports leads the GSR to\nfall by 0.21 percentage points. At the mean corruption index score of 3.6,\na one unit increase in resource exports leads to a decrease in the GSR of\n0.15 points, and at the maximum index score of 6 (i.e. in the least corrupt\nstate), a one unit increase in resource exports leads to a decrease in the GSR\nof merely 0.07 points. When the rule of law is at its worst value of zero, a\none percentage point increase in the ratio of resource to total exports leads\nthe GSR to fall by 0.19 percentage points. At the mean index score of 4.05,\na one unit increase in resource exports leads to a decrease in the GSR of\n0.13 points, and at the maximum index score of 6 (i.e. when there is full rule\nof law), a one unit increase in resource exports leads to a decrease in the\nGSR of 0.09 points.\nLooking at figure 1 shows that our measure of resource abundance is\nhighly skewed. Most countries have modest ratios of resource to total\nexports (and mostly positive GS rates), whereas two dozen or so countries\nhave a very high resource exports to total exports ratio (andmostly negative\nGS rates). One might be concerned that the skewness of this variable\ninfluences our results. In sensitivity analysis, we have therefore taken the\nnatural log of the resource abundance variable and re-estimated all themod-\nels. Results were little affected in qualitative terms. Interestingly, the inter-\naction term between lack of corruption and the log of resource exports is\nnow statistically significant even in Arellano and Bond\u2019s (1991) one-step\nestimator. One might be further concerned not only about outliers in terms\nof resource abundance, but about outliersmore generally. If we additionally\nexclude from the sample observations that have at the same time high\nresiduals and high leverage on the regression results following a criterion\ndescribed in Belsley et al. (1980), then again our results hardly change.8\n8 The leverage of an observation is a multivariate measure of the distance between\nits X values and the sample means.

Conclusion\nResource-rich economies have historically grown more slowly than\nresource-poor economies, particularly in the last thirty years or so. This\nis apparently paradoxical, since resource extraction should generate the\nincome tomake productive investments in other forms of capital. Resource-\nrich countries fail to do this. The World Bank\u2019s data show that it is the\nmost resource-abundant countries of the world that have also been the\npoorest genuine savers over the last thirty years, with many of them\nhaving persistently negative GS rates. This amounts to an unsustainable\nconsumption of resource rents. More should have been invested in other\nforms of capital, if these countries were to pursue a more sustainable\npath. Also, in theory at least, GS performance today will impact future\ngrowth performance, so without higher GS, resource-abundant countries\nare likely to under-perform in terms of future growth relative to resource-\npoor countries.\nAlthough some direct economic explanations of the resource curse have\nbeen put forward in the past with a modicum of success \u2013 most notably\n\u2018Dutch disease\u2019 effects \u2013 it is ultimately policy failure that underpins the\ncurse. This has inspired us to test whether improving institutional quality\nhas a positive effect on the relationship between resource abundance and\nGS. We have presented evidence on the relationship between institutional\nquality, resource abundance and GS (as well as gross savings). We asked\nthe question, does improving the quality of a country\u2019s political and\nbureaucratic institutions in various dimensions mitigate the negative effect\nof resource abundance on the GSR? Atkinson and Hamilton (2003) paved\nthe way for our paper by offering tentative evidence of an interaction\nbetween institutional quality in general and resource abundance in\ndetermining gross saving\/investment: resource-rich countries with good\nquality institutions have enjoyed higher rates of gross investment and\nsaving. This result was derived in a cross-sectional setting, which might be\nmisleading if the explanatory variables are correlated with country-specific\nfixed effects. Our panel data design allowed us to control for both country-\nspecific fixed and dynamic effects. We find some, if limited, evidence that\nresource abundance in interaction with institutional quality is associated\nwith a higher gross savings rate.\nHowever, it is ultimately genuine savings, not gross savings, that matters\nfor weak sustainable development and we have therefore estimated the\nimpact of the interaction of resource abundance and institutional quality\non the GSR. Also, institutional quality is a broad concept and we have\nattempted to discriminate between different aspects. There are persuasive\ntheoretical and empirical arguments in the literature that suggest corruption\nmay be a major explanatory factor in the resource curse. They often\ndescribe a process inwhich investment is eithermisdirected or discouraged\naltogether. A failure to invest resource rents would depress GS, ceteris\nin absolute terms than twice the square root of k\/n are excluded, where k is the\nnumber of independent variables and n the number of observations, and where\nDFITS is defined as the square root of (hi\/(1 \u2013 hi)), where hi is an observation\u2019s\nleverage, multiplied by its studentized residual.\n50 Simon Dietz et al.\nparibus. In addition, there are arguments forwider political economy effects,\nsummarised in Isham et al. (2003). These explain the resource curse in\nterms of the control exerted by political elites over resource rents. There\nis little incentive to develop a competent government bureaucracy and to\ndiversify the national economy into other sectors, a process that the political\nelites resist through a combination of undemocratic decision-making and\nrepression of more-or-less violent forms.\nWe have therefore tested three different indicators of institutional quality\nin the framework of our hypothesis, employing corruption, bureaucratic\nquality and rule of law indices from ICRG. On the basis of our evidence,\nwe suggest that corruption is a significant cause of a low GSR in resource-\nrich countries. There is also some limited, but not robust, evidence that\nimproving the rule of lawmight have a similar effect to reducing corruption.\nIn a nutshell, the message of our paper is that resource-rich countries\ncan improve their weak sustainability performance by fighting corruption,\ndifficult as this may be. They should ratify and take serious steps to\nimplement the recently negotiated UN Convention against Corruption\n(www.unodc.org\/unodc\/en\/crime_convention_corruption.html). It is also\nencouraging to see that theWorldBankhaspromised as part of its Extractive\nIndustries Review to require lending countries to undertake proper and\ntransparent revenue accounting (www.worldbank.org\/ogmc\/), but one\nwished it had taken a more outspoken view toward the need to fight\ncorruption in resource-rich countries. This is not to say that countries\nshould only focus on anti-corruption measures: there are many other\nvery persuasive reasons why all aspects of institutional quality should be\nimproved. Indeed, improvements on one dimension are almost certain to\nlead to improvements in others. Nevertheless, in order to put themselves\non a more sustainable investment pathway, we recommend that resource-\nrich countries as a priority strive to reduce the corrupt practices that stymie\ninvestment and make it unproductive.\nReferences\nAcemoglu, D., S.

Measuring Capital for the XXI\nCentury\u2019, Washington, DC: World Bank.\nAppendix I. World Bank estimates of GS\nInvestment in produced capital, net foreign borrowing and net official transfers are\nobtained from thenational accounts.Although depreciation of produced capital\nis not, estimates can be derived from data on produced capital formation.\nThe World Bank uses estimates made by the United Nations Statistics\nDivision. Note that net investment in produced capital and foreign assets is\naggregated across both the private and public sectors. This means that we\nare not able to use government consumption or investment to explain GS\nrates.\nEnvironment and Development Economics 53\nNet depreciation of natural capital can be divided at a basic level into\nresource extraction on the one hand and environmental pollution on the\nother. The latter is conceptualised as the use of sink capacity in order for\nit to be equivalent to capital depreciation. The Bank estimates resource\nextraction for a range of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, hard coal and brown\ncoal), minerals (bauxite, copper, iron, lead, nickel, zinc, phosphate, tin, gold\nand silver), and one renewable resource (forests). Depreciation of natural\ncapital due to resource depletion is computed as the product of price\nminus average costs of extraction multiplied by the volume of extraction:\n(P-AC)\u2217R, where P is the resource price, AC is average cost and R is the\nvolume of extraction (in the case of a renewable resource R represents\nharvest beyond natural regeneration). Average costs are used instead of the\ntheoretically correct marginal costs due to a lack of data. Environmental\npollution is taken to be the estimated damage cost of carbon dioxide\nemissions, where each metric tonne of carbon emitted is valued at US$20.\nThis value is taken from Fankhauser (1995) and is below the median of the\nmore recent meta-analysis of studies estimating the marginal damage of\ncarbon contained in Tol (2005). Note that we omit the damage cost from\ncarbon dioxide emissions from the estimation of GS, following Ferreira and\nVincent (2005). This is justified because the damage cost of climate change\nto the environmental capital stock of a country is not equivalent to the\ndamage of its emissions. Instead, it is the global concentration of carbon\ndioxide in the atmosphere, a function of global emissions, which matters,\nin combination with the country-specific vulnerabilities to climate change,\nwhich are difficult to model. Empirically, it makes almost no difference to\nour estimations if the cost of carbon dioxide emissions is included in the GS\nmeasure.\nInvestment in human capital is calculated as net educational expenditures.\nThis includes both capital expenditures as well as current expenditures\nthat are counted as consumption rather than investment in the traditional\nnational accounts. This is regarded as a first approximation to the full value\nof human capital investment, which is difficult to measure precisely.\n"}
