INTRODUCTION\nThe method of two-photon imaging has opened up a new\nway to generate data on cell motility in vivo. This method\nallows tracking of cell movement in living organs with only\nminimum disturbance. Therefore, the behavior of the cells\ncan be considered to be representative of real in vivo behav-\nior. Recently, this method has been applied to B cells sBCd\nand T cells sTCd in lymph nodes of mice f1,2g. Lymph nodes\nare prominent secondary lymphoid organs in which the in-\nteraction of lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells is or-\nganised. The motility of lymphocytes within secondary lym-\nphoid organs is still a matter of controversy. BC and TC\nexpress and regulate chemokine receptors f3\u20135g and may\ntherefore move according to chemotaxis or haptotaxis. In\ncontrast to this hypothesis, two-photon data seem to favor a\nrandom walk of lymphocytes at least in the outer region of\nlymph nodes including primary follicles f6g.\nWe aim to develop a model that describes lymphocyte\nmigration in secondary lymphoid organs and revisit the in-\nterpretation of the results found with two-photon imaging. As\nthe data show a stochastic variation of cell motility we are\nrestricted to the class of stochastic models. Assuming that\ncell shape and motility are closely interlinked with each\nother f7g, the cell cannot be represented by a point but has to\nbe spatially resolved to some extent. Thus, within lattice de-\nscriptions, the lattice has to be of higher resolution than the\ncell diameter. Alternatively, one may introduce flexible cell\nobjects as was done in f8\u201310g, and which will be discussed\nseparately.\nThe extended Potts model is the classical approach for the\ndescription of cells at a subcellular level, i.e., including prop-\nerties such as cell shape, surface molecules, organelles, or\nother internal structures f11g. It is derived from the Ising\nmodel and extends the latter to multiple spin states. A cell is\ndefined by all volume elements that are in the same spin\nstate. Movements, or more general changes on the lattice, are\ndriven by a Boltzmann law at some biological temperature.\nThe contributions to the energy term in the Boltzmann-\nexponential define the cellular dynamics and interactions. In\nslightly more general terms the Potts model can be described\nas a potential-based thermodynamical model.\nA cell subunit has to adopt the spin states of its neighbor\npoint for cell movement. In this way every cell movement is\nintrinsically correlated with a change of cell volume. On\nlonger time scales these volume fluctuations are averaged\nout, at least if a volume conserving potential is included in\nthe energy entering the Boltzmann law. A peculiarity of this\nconcept is that cells composed of one volume element only\nare in some sense immobile: Either the cell with a single\nvolume element disappears by a spin flip or it doubles its\nvolume. It is inferred that if the Potts model is to be applied\nto cells with small numbers of subunits, additional rules have\nto be included.\nIn the following we discuss an alternative model architec-\nture which intrinsically includes the one- and the multi-\nsubunit limit within one concept. This opens up the possibil-\nity of determining the lattice constant by the size of the\nsmallest cell in the system under consideration, which then\nwould be described by a single volume element. The CPU\nload could be limited in this way when it is not the substruc-\nture of the cells that is interesting but their differences in\nvolume.\nAs cells are widely incompressible objects we aim to use\na mechanism of cell movement that conserves the total vol-\nume of the cell sif no growth or shrinking is intendedd. In our\nnew model, denoted by the Greek word for tissue hyphasma,\nin the following, all reaction kinetics are formulated as reac-\ntion rates and actions are taken according to probabilistic\ndecisions.

II and then apply it to lymphocytes. We will analyze and\ninterpret two-photon motility data in the framework of hy-\nphasma in Sec. III.\nII. DEFINITION OF THE MODEL\nA. General considerations\nThe new model for cell motility aims at capturing cell\ndeformations and displacement in an agent-based model con-\ncept. Single subunit agent-based models are excluded for\nthree reasons: First, the cell volume is not adequately repre-\nsented. Second, cell deformations can not be explicitly rep-\nresented. Finally, the velocity distributions as found in the\ntwo-photon imaging experiments cannot be reproduced. The\nlast point follows from the fact that displacements have been\nrecorded at intervals of 10 minutes: The lattice resolution is\ndetermined by the cell volume for single subunit models. At\nthat resolution the cells have to overcome a large distance\nwithin a single time step for every movement. In order to\nrespect the average velocity such large distance movements\nhave to be rare events, thus leading to a rather discontinuous\nvelocity distribution sin contrast to the experimental resultsd.\nThus a correct description of cell volume and velocity distri-\nbution exclude each other in a single subunit agent-based\nmodel.\nIn the two-photon imaging experiment cell tracks were\nprojected onto a two-dimensional plane. The authors found\nthat most cells \u201cpreferentially moved parallel to the overly-\ning capsule\u201d f1g. Therefore, as a first step, two-dimensional\nsimulations can be considered as a good approximation for\nthese data. The influence of the third dimension will be ana-\nlyzed in future work.\nThe model hyphasma is based on rather simple assump-\ntions, thus following a reductionalist point of view. Cell ob-\njects are represented by the cell volume, the cell polarity pW\nsdefined in Sec. II Bd, a list of cell subunits, and internal\nvelocity states. The cell volume determines the number of\ncell subunits N according to the space resolution Dx. The\nvelocity state v\u00af is translated into probabilities of subunit\nmovements pmove in the direction of the cell polarity pW ac-\ncording to the time resolution Dt scompare Sec. II Bd.\nCell velocity states are observable in experiments but they\nare difficult to relate to internal cell properties. The velocities\nvW i of the subunits as observed in the model results, however,\nmay be related to physical forces FW i according to the over-\ndamped force equation:\nvW i = FW i\/gi, s1d\nwhere gi represents friction and i denotes the subunit under\nconsideration. In this picture the velocities of the subunits\nare the result of a force balance sthat may include reshaping\ncell forces, forces due to active cell motility towards a\nchemokine, etc.d. The gi arise as a result of a number of\nprocesses, for example, the viscosity of the cytosol within a\ncell, and adhesion between cells. Note, however, that a force\nbalance equation for the cell subunits is not necessarily a\ncorrect description of active processes of deformation and\nreshaping of cells. Thus the interpretation of cell subunit\nvelocities in terms of forces has to be considered as an ap-\nproximation to more complex internal processes within the\ncell. In the present investigation we do not make use of this\ninterpretation and focus on the movement of free cells, thus\nneglecting chemotaxis and adhesion to other cells. Thus we\ndirectly use the cell velocity as found in experiment as input\nfor the model.\nIn the following we base the kinetics of the cell subunits\non two types of velocity: sid undirected active movement\nwith persistence of orientation, and siid cell reshaping.\nB. Active cell movement\nThe normed orientation vector pW determines the direction\nof the active movement of a cell. This vector represents an\noverall polarity of the cell which in reality is a complex\nfunction of internal organisation of the cytoskeleton as well\nas localized signal pathways. pW may be considered as an\napproximation for the direction in which protrusions are de-\nveloped by the cell that induce cell movement. The orienta-\ntion vector is assumed to change randomly with a probability\nper time step that represents the persistence time Dtpersist, i.e.,\nthe inverse rate of change of orientation.\nEach individual cell has at least one active velocity state\nv\u00afactive determining the probability of subunit movement in\ndirection pW . The active movement of the cell is performed by\nthe following procedure ssee Fig. 1d: The barycenter of the\ncell bW is virtually shifted in the direction of pW to the border of\nthe cell bWvirtual. Then every subunit representing a border\npoint of the cell is moved in random order towards free lat-\ntice points near the virtual barycenter fsee Eq. s2dg. When a\nborder subunit which is not a direct neighbor of its target\npoint se.g., a subunit on the back of the celld is moved, this\nprocedure corresponds to a shift of the cytosol through the\nwhole cell. Note that in the present model all subunits carry\nthe same properties. It is only when the subunits store other\nproperties, such as for example integrin expression, that an\nexplicit copy algorithm of properties has to be used. When\nthe movement of a border subunit would cause the subunits\nof the cell to become disconnected the movement is sup-\npressed. For example, a subunit in the middle of a tail with a\nwidth of one subunit only cannot be moved.\nNote that the border subunits are not necessarily moved to\nthe target point nearest to bWvirtual because this would lead to\nmovements reflecting the lattice symmetry. Instead, we allow\nfor deviations from the nearest target point and in this way\nreduce anisotropic effects on the cell movement. Within the\nset of free neighbor points of the cell, i.e., possible target\npoints, only those points are considered which are within a\ndistance di of the virtual barycenter, where\ndi \u0142 usdfar \u2212 dneard + dnear, s2d\nwith\nM.

The target point is chosen\nrandomly within this reduced set of points. In the limit of\na\u21920 and b=0 only the target point nearest to the virtual\nbarycenter is considered. Large values of a and b reduce\nanisotropy but also limit cell elongation. We chose the small-\nest values such that anisotropic effects are not detectable by\neye, leading to a=b=0.2. However, the model behavior is\nrobust against changes of these values as long as both values\nremain in the range between 0.1 and 0.4.\nThe tolerated deviations from the target point nearest to\nthe virtual barycenter as described by Eq. s2d are designed to\nbe adaptive to the deformation state of the cell. For large cell\ndeformations si.e., dfar@dneard u\u2192b holds, while u=1 for an\nideal spherical cell si.e., dfar=dneard. However, the exact\nchoice of Eq. s2d is arbitrary. Alternative descriptions with\nsimilar general properties are not distinguishable within the\naccuracy of the model.\nThe displacement of subunits is stopped when either no\nborder subunit remains to be moved or the barycenter of the\ncell has been displaced by one lattice constant. In the new\nstate the cell has reorganized its membrane and thus changed\nits shape. Thereby the total volume sthe cell area in two\ndimensionsd of the cell is conserved. Thus the movement of\nthe cell barycenter is realized by subunit rearrangements, and\ninherently couples the cell movement to its deformation.\nThe velocity state of the cell determines the rate with\nwhich the whole procedure is started, which translates into a\nmovement probability\npactive =\n1\nh\nDt\nDx\nv\u00afactive, s4d\nwith Dt and Dx being the time and space resolution, respec-\ntively. Note that instead of moving all subunits within a\nsingle time step their movement may be distributed on h\n\u00f81 time steps. Then only a fraction 1\/h of the subunits is\nmoved per time step. This parameter sbeside the lattice con-\nstant Dxd changes the stochastic variability of the cell move-\nment.\nIt is worth mentioning that the algorithm for rearrange-\nment of the cell subunits does not belong to the class of\nMarkov processes if N.1: Within every time step the sub-\nunits of a cell which have already moved determine which\nsubunits may still be moved. However, all other processes\nare Markov-like. For example, the change of orientation de-\npends neither on the time passed since the last change nor on\nthe present or previous orientation.\nWithin this model framework every cell optionally can\nembed different velocity states that are characterized by dif-\nferent mean active velocities v\u00afi. They are adopted randomly\nand the velocity state is switched with a probability corre-\nsponding to a persistence time of velocity states Dtvi. The\nlatter can be constant for all states or may be shorter for\nstates with higher velocities. The assumption of more than\none velocity state for the active movement of cells will be\nfurther discussed and compared to two-photon imaging data\nin Sec. III.\nC. Cell reshaping\nThe second ingredient of the cell motility model concerns\nthe cell shape stability f7g. During the procedure of active\ncell movement all forces that reshape the cell towards a\nsphere, i.e., hydrostatic pressure, reduced actin filament as-\nsembly, actomyosin contraction, or membrane surface ten-\nsion, are ignored. All these forces are included in a single\nreshaping force. This overall elastic force drives the subunits\nof an elongated cell back to the current barycenter and pro-\nmotes a spherical shape. Note that we do not attempt to\ndescribe the intracellular processes that underlie this total\nrearrangement in detail. The concentration of all these\nmechanisms into a single force on the cell subunits has to be\nconsidered as a phenomenological approximation.\nFIG. 1. A schematic description of cell movement by subunit\nrearrangement around a virtual barycenter. Immobile cell subunits\nare shown in light grey, border subunits that may be moved in\nwhite, putative free target points in dark grey, and other points in\nblack. The current barycenter is denoted by the dot, and the cell\npolarity by the arrow attached to it. The arrow points the position of\nthe virtual barycenter at the border of the cell. The starting position\nis shown on the top left. A random white subunit is chosen and\nmoved towards the target point nearest to the virtual barycenter\nsopen arrow upper paneld.

In that case the moved subunit is at the back of the\ncell and all cytosol subunits in between are shifted correspondingly.\nThe result is shown in the lower left panel. The procedure is re-\npeated sthe open arrow in the lower left panel shows a possible next\nstepd until all white subunits have been moved or removed from the\nto move list. A possible final constellation with a recalculated bary-\ncenter is shown in the lower right panel.\nINTERPRETING TWO-PHOTON IMAGING DATA OF \u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 061912 s2005d\n061912-3\nIn complete analogy to the active cell movement, cell\nreshaping is represented by a velocity vshape of the cell sub-\nunits, which transforms into a cell border subunit movement\nprobability pshape according to Eq. s4d with h=1. Subunits\nthat are far from the barycenter are preferentially moved, i.e.,\nif di is the distance of subunit i to the barycenter, then the\nsubunit is moved with probability\npi = pshape\ndiNborder\no\nj=1\nNborder\ndj\n. s5d\nAll Nborder border subunits are moved in random order. It is\nworth emphasizing that the results presented below are found\nalso for the simpler assumption pi= pshape.\nThe target point of every moved subunit is the free lattice\npoint nearest to the current barycenter. Note that in contrast\nto the case of active movement no deviation is tolerated fi.e.,\na=0.01 and b=10\u22128 in Eq. s3dg. The reshaping forces should\nvanish for a spherical cell. We assume the reshaping process\nto scale with the elongation of the cell, estd=dfarstd \/rcell, as a\nspring. Here dfarstd denotes the distance of the subunit far-\nthest from the barycenter at time t and rcell the radius of the\nhypothetical spherical cell with the same volume N. We as-\nsume that the reshaping force saturates for long elongations,\nsetting an upper limit to the velocity of the intracellular\nmechanisms that reorganize the cell shape. This is described\nby a Hill equation with Hill coefficient 1:\nvshapestd = \u2212 v\u00afshape\nestd \u2212 1\nestd + Ke \u2212 2\n, s6d\nwith v\u00afshape the asymptotic subunit velocity and Ke the elon-\ngation that corresponds to half of the maximum reshaping\nforce. The direction of reshaping forces is defined by the\ndifference vector between the subunit under consideration\nand the barycenter. Equation s6d enters the simulation via the\nsubunit movement probability calculated with Eq. s4d for\nvshapestd and h=1.\nWe would like to make the additional remark that the\nreshaping velocity may be interpreted as corresponding to an\nelastic force where all forces acting on the border subunits of\nthe cell according to Eq. s1d are summed up to FW elastic. The\nelastic force per surface area A is the tensile stress s of the\ncell which can be related to the elasticity modulus E:\ns =\nuFW elasticu\nA\n= E\nDxmax \u2212 rcell\nrcell\n= Ese \u2212 1d . s7d\nIf these properties are measured for the cell type under con-\nsideration, then the reshaping velocity v\u00afshape may be calcu-\nlated, thus providing a consistency check.\nD. Space resolution\nOn the conceptual level the model is fully formulated in\nterms that are independent of the time or space resolution. In\nparticular, a formulation in terms of subunit velocities in-\nstead of diffusion constants is essential in this context. Using\ndiffusion constants to define cell motility effectively intro-\nduces a persistence of the random walk proportional to the\nlattice constant Dx. Therefore the diffusion constant would\nhave to be interpreted relative to the lattice resolution. This\nambiguity is avoided by relying on velocities. However, an\neffective diffusion constant can be attributed to the move-\nment by interpreting the persistence time Dtpersist of the ori-\nentation of the cell stogether with the mean velocity of active\nmovement v\u00afactived as lattice constant Dxpersist of a virtual lat-\ntice, in which the orientation is changed in every time step:\nDpersist ; ppersist\nDxpersist\n2\n2dDtpersist\n= v\u00afactive\nDtpersist\nDxpersist\nDxpersist\n2\n2dDtpersist\n= v\u00afactive\n2 Dtpersist\n2d\n, s8d\nwith d the dimension of the lattice.\nThe stochastic diversity of the results nevertheless de-\npends on the spatial resolution for small numbers of sub-\nunits. Within that diversity we can test that the results are\nindependent of the lattice constant Dx by performing in silico\nexperiments in a regime where the stochastic width is prima-\nrily due to the probabilistic nature of the model and not due\nto small numbers of subunits.\nIII. RESULTS\nThe application of this model to specific cell types in-\nvolves a small number of parameters only. Given the size of\nthe cells the lattice constant Dx determines the number of\ncell subunits N that represent the cell in the model. The cell\nproperties to be determined for every cell type include sid the\nnumber of velocity states for active movement and the cor-\nresponding mean velocities v\u00afactive, siid the persistence time\nDtpersist for every active velocity state, siiid the reshaping ve-\nlocity v\u00afshape, and sivd the elongation corresponding to the half\nmaximum reshaping force Ke. The artificial parameter h that\ndistributes the active cell movement on different time steps is\nused to adapt the stochastic variability of the model behavior.\nThe natural choice is h=1, i.e., all subunits are moved within\nthe same time step. The parameters a and b, which reduce\nanisotropic effects, are considered to be model intrinsic and\nwill be kept constant. There are no further parameters in the\nmodel.\nA. A purely stochastic interpretation of the data\nIn the following we see if the in vivo measurement of TC\nand BC motility in lymph nodes f1g can be repeated in silico\nusing our model. The resolution of the lattice is set to Dx\n=0.4 mm. This implies TC and BC to consist of N=241 sub-\nunits. As for the in vivo case, cell velocities are measured at\nintervals of 10 seconds in silico snote that the time interval is\nrelevant and changes the general properties of the measure-\nment f12gd. Time courses have been registered for 12 min-\nutes. A total of 3277 measurements for TC and 3251 for BC\nhave been carried out in vivo f1g. Thus the number of cells to\nbe observed is determined to be 46. The mean velocity in\nsilico is fixed to the mean value measured in vivo of v\u00afactive\nTC\n=10.8 mm\/min for TC and to v\u00afactive\nBC\n=5.1 mm\/min, slightly\nM. E. MEYER-HERMANN AND P. K. MAINI PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 061912 s2005d\n061912-4\nbelow the measured mean value for BC ssee below for ex-\nplanationd. The orientation persistence of the cells has been\nfound in vivo to be between 1 and 3 minutes. Thus the value\nof Dtpersist=2 minutes is assumed in silico. The reshaping\nforce, and the elongation corresponding to the half maximum\nreshaping force are chosen such that the shape index is in the\ncorrect range. The shape index is defined as the ratio of the\naxis length in direction of cell polarity to the axis length\nperpendicular to it. Note that the direction of cell polarity\ndoes not necessarily coincide with the long axis. However, it\nturns out that this is a good approximation to the ratio of the\nreal longest to shortest axis. This infers v\u00afshape\nTC\n=2 mm\/min\nand Ke\nTC\n=2.5 for TC, while for BC, v\u00afshapeBC =4 mm\/min and\nKe\nBC\n=1.3.\n1. Velocity time course\nThe time courses of single representative TC and BC as\nfound by the model are shown in Fig. 2. The time course\nshows maximum velocity around 25 mm\/min for TC and\naround 14 mm\/min for BC swith single higher peak veloci-\ntiesd, as found in vivo ssee f1g, Fig. 2C and Dd. TC and BC\nare rarely found at rest. In silico this is related to random\nmovements of some subunits around the optimal shape even\nwhen little or no active movement occurs. This always in-\nduces small displacements of the barycenter.\nThe stochastic nature of the in silico experiment is also\nthe origin of the changes between fast and slow active move-\nments of the cells. Thus the diversity of observed cell veloci-\nties is a pure result of stochasticity and not of active changes\nof cell states.\n2. Time course of shape index\nThe time courses of the shape index sdefined as ratio of\nlong to short axisd are shown for TC and BC in Fig. 2 scen-\ntral panelsd.

The shape index of\nBC shows fewer alterations and is bounded by the value of 2.\nThe range of the shape index is determined by both the\nassumed mean velocity of the cells and the reshaping forces.\nThe mean velocities are determined by the velocity distribu-\ntion found by two-photon imaging.

Correlation of velocity and shape index\nThe correlation of cell velocity and cell elongation is in-\ntrinsic to the model as cell migration is realized by the move-\nment of its subunits. We calculate this correlation c\u00af for single\ntime courses according to\nc\u00af = o\ni=1\n3266 \u0084dstid \u2212 d\u00af\u0085\u0084vstid \u2212 v\u00af\u0085\nFo\nj=1\n3266\n\u0084dstjd \u2212 d\u00af\u00852 o\nk=1\n3266\n\u0084vstkd \u2212 v\u00af\u00852G1\/2 , s9d\nwhere d\u00af and v\u00af denote the mean values of the shape index and\nvelocity, respectively. The correlation fulfills the condition\n\u22121\u0142 c\u00af\u01421. Values near 1 or \u22121 correspond to strong positive\nor negative correlation of velocity and elongation, respec-\ntively, while values near 0 are adopted in case of uncorrela-\ntion. The time course of the product in the numerator is\nshown in Fig. 2 slower panelsd. This value is not the corre-\nlation itself but a measure of the contribution of a specific\ncell to the correlation at every time point. The product is\ndominantly positive and reflects the coupling of cell motility\nto cell elongation. Interestingly, negative products in most\ncases occur after changes of orientation of the cells. The cells\nhave to repolarize after changes of orientation such that the\ndirections of movement and of elongation are uncorrelated\nfor a short period. This is even more pronounced the more\nthe cells are elongated. Indeed, the correlation is c\u00af=30% for\nTC and 54% for BC in the case shown in Fig. 2. More\ngenerally the average over 46 simulations is c\u00af=32% \u00b19%\nfor TC and 58% \u00b19% for BC. Thus, the reorientation phases\nreduce the correlation found for rather elongated TC com-\npared to more spherical BC.\n4. Velocity distribution\nThe velocities measured in silico in the time courses of 46\nTC and BC are summed up and presented in a histogram as\naverage counts per cell including one standard deviation ssee\nFig. 3sad,sbdd. The in vivo results are reproduced for com-\nparison ssee black barsd. According to the assumption of a\nsingle velocity state we find smooth velocity distributions for\nboth cell types. The width of the TC distribution is larger\ncompared to that for BC and corresponds well to the width\nfound in vivo for both TC and BC. Note that the width has\nnot been fitted. We used h=1, i.e., all subunits of a cell are\nmoved within the same time step for both cell types. Thus,\nthe resulting width is a prediction of the model and can be\ninterpreted as the natural stochastic width that results from\nthe values used for cell velocity and reshaping forces.\nThe maximum of the velocity distribution saveraged per\ncelld is larger for BC than for TC. A higher maximum value\nappears to result in a smaller width of the velocity distribu-\ntion for BC. The values can be compared quantitatively to\nthe total sum of all in vivo observed velocities ssee f1g, Fig.\n2C and Dd by multiplying the average counts with the total\nnumber s46d of considered cells. At the maximum of the\nvelocity distribution this leads to 515\u00b1138 counts for TC\nand 667\u00b1138 for BC. The in vivo values of 622 and 778,\nrespectively, lie within one standard deviation.\nFIG. 3. For the in silico experiment in Fig. 2, the velocity and\nshape index distributions are averaged over all 46 considered TC\nfpanels sad and scdg and BC fpanels sbd and sddg.

MAINI PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 061912 s2005d\n061912-6\nThe mean velocity of TC is found to be 10.4 mm\/min and\ncorresponds to the value assumed for active movement of\n10.8 mm\/min. This is in no way self-evident and depends on\nthe relation of cell movement induced by reshaping forces\nand active movement. The assumed value determines only\nthe latter. Thus we can conclude that only a minor part of TC\nmovement is due to reshaping forces acting on deformed\ncells. For BC the mean velocity is found to be 6.9 mm\/min\nwhich compares with 6.4 mm\/min in vivo. This value is\nlarger than the value assumed for active movement of\n5.1 mm\/min. This points to a larger fraction of BC move-\nment as a result of cell reshaping forces.\nFor a more quantitative comparison with the experimental\ndata we calculate a deviation factor\nsN\n2\n=\n1\nNoi=1\nN\nnsvid \u2212 nsvi\nexpd\nnsvi\nexpd\n, s10d\nwhere nsvid and nsvi\nexpd are the counts at velocity vi in silico\nand in vivo, respectively, and N is the total number of counts.\nThis leads to s25\n2 sTCd=0.54 and s232 sBCd=0.38 for the T\ncells and B cells in Fig. 3, respectively. For both cell types\nthe deviation factor is dominated by the velocity counts at\n10 mm\/min. Simulations with more than a single velocity\nstate of the cells will be compared with these values.\n5. Shape index distribution\nIn analogy to the velocity distribution, a shape index dis-\ntribution is evaluated on the basis of 46 TC and BC ssee Fig.\n3scd,sddd. The shape index distribution is similar to the veloc-\nity distribution. However, due to the larger reshaping forces\nin BC the model predicts a shift of the BC distribution to\nsmaller elongations, and substantially larger peak elongation\nfor TC than for BC. The average shape indices are 2.4 and\n1.4 for TC and BC, respectively.\n6. Cell tracking and territory explored\nThe tracks of all cells are followed and superimposed on a\nsingle figure ssee Fig. 4d. The territory explored by the TC\nand BC in silico is consistent with the one found in vivo ssee\nsuperimposed tracks of all cells in f1g, Fig. 3A and Bd. Note\nthat single TC reach a distance of about 100 mm from their\noriginal position while most BC do not reach a distance of\n50 mm from their original position.\n7. The mean displacement of lymphocytes\nThe displacement of TC and BC from their starting posi-\ntion is followed with time. The mean displacement of the 46\ncells is plotted against the square root of time including one\nstandard deviation ssee Fig. 5d. For both cells we find ap-\nproximately a straight line, agreeing with in vivo results. The\nmean displacement in silico after t=12 minutes si.e., t1\/2\n=3.5d of x=56 mm for TC and x=25 mm for BC is in excel-\nlent agreement with the values found in vivo ssee dotted line\nin Fig. 5d. From these values we can deduce an underlying\ndiffusion coefficient Dobserved\nTC\/BC\n=x2 \/ s2dtd which gives\nDobserved\nTC\n= 65\nmm2\nmin\n, Dobserved\nBC\n= 13\nmm2\nmin\n. s11d\nNote that according to Eq. s8d this corresponds to persistence\ntimes of orientation Dtpersist of 2.2 and 2.0 minutes for TC\nand BC, respectively, i.e., the value assumed in the simula-\ntion. This supports the consistency of the model results.\nThe lag time before the onset of the linear behavior in Fig.\n5 appears to be longer in silico than in vivo. In silico the lag\ntime is identical to the assumed persistence time, as it should\nbe. The in vivo data show shorter directional memory but the\nsame persistence times are observed. On longer time scales\nin vivo displacements are slightly smaller than expected\nfrom the straight line. Therefore it is likely that the rather\nshort lag time in vivo is an artifact.\n8. Concluding remarks\nThe adjustment of reshaping and active movement veloci-\nties are sufficient within our model to reproduce the main TC\nFIG. 4. Superimposed tracks of 46 TC supper paneld and BC\nslower paneld. Data from the same in silico experiment as in Fig. 2.\nINTERPRETING TWO-PHOTON IMAGING DATA OF \u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 061912 s2005d\n061912-7\nand BC properties as found with two-photon measurement.\nNo further assumptions are needed. An important conclusion\nof the in silico experiment is that no switch of the internal\nstate of the cell is necessary in order to produce the alter-\nations in the single cell velocity time course as well as in the\nshape index time course. Thus the model-intrinsic stochastic\nwidth of the cell movement is sufficient in order to generate\nthe diversity of velocities observed experimentally. This re-\nsult is underlined by the fact that the stochastic diversity of\nTC and BC differ in vivo, which turns out to be reproduced\nin silico without tuning the stochastic width.\nNote, however, that in vivo a velocity near the mean ve-\nlocity remains underpopulated for TC and BC ssee Fig. 3,\nblack barsd, while in silico the velocity distribution is mono-\ntonic on both sides of the maximum. For BC the in vivo\nvalue lies within the statistical width, whereas for TC it is\nincluded within 3 standard deviations of the in silico experi-\nment and, therefore, this has to be considered as a disagree-\nment between in vivo and in silico results. This calls into\nquestion the in silico assumption of a single velocity state.\nInstead one may think of a superposition of more distinct\nvelocity states that are adopted by the cell according to some\nunknown environmental change, or simply randomly. This\nwill be further elaborated below.\nB. Changing spatial resolution\nThe same in silico experiments are repeated with half spa-\ntial resolution of a=0.8 mm, i.e., cells with 60 subunits. The\nresults for BC are shown in Fig. 6. Here the same parameter\nset sv\u00afshape=4 mm\/min, Ke=1.3, and v\u00afactive=5.1 mm\/mind as\nfor higher resolution sDx=0.4 mmd has been used. The re-\nsulting characteristic data are similar to the high resolution\ncase: mean velocity of 7.0 mm\/min, mean shape index of\n1.6, summed velocity histogram with 722\u00b1175 counts at the\nmaximum, and mean displacement after 12 minutes of\n23 mm. The deviation factor according to Eq. s10d is s23\n2\n=0.43.\nThis result confirms that the model has been formulated in\nterms independent of the lattice resolution. However, a major\nprecondition of this result is that the parameters are chosen\nin such a way that the stochasticity of the result is mainly\ndue to the probabilistic nature of the model and not due to\nstochastic noise because of small subunit numbers. In the\ncase of BC this is ensured by a relatively large reshaping\nforce. In contrast the reshaping force of TC is relatively\nsmall. Therefore, a corresponding experiment with lower\nresolution for TC requires the parameter Ke to be changed\nfrom 2.5 to 1.3 to obtain the same result.\nFor higher resolutions the results remain independent of\nthe resolution because the stochastic noise due to small sub-\nunit numbers becomes negligible sdata not shownd.\nC. T cells with two velocity states\nIn order to try to capture the in vivo behavior which is\nsuggestive of two velocity peaks, we introduce two velocities\nfor active movement sv\u00afactive=16, 8 mm\/mind. The width of\nthe velocity distribution has to be considerably reduced. The\nmodel\u2019s intrinsic stochasticity can be changed by distributing\nevery cell movement on several sh=100d time steps. The\nchange of velocity states is correlated with the change of\npolarity, thus coupling cell velocity and reorientation ssee\nFig. 7, upper paneld. A less populated mean velocity is ob-\nserved.\nIf both processes, reorientation and change of velocity\nstate, are decoupled from each other, a similar result is found\nssee Fig. 7 lower paneld. Obviously, it is not necessary to\ncouple the dynamics of orientation and velocity state in order\nFIG. 5.

MAINI PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 061912 s2005d\n061912-8\nto find a depopulated mean velocity in the velocity distribu-\ntion as experimentally observed.\nThe total width of the velocity distribution is incorrect for\nvery high and very low velocities which, in contrast to the in\nvivo results, are not sufficiently populated in the in silico\nexperiment. This is affirmed by the deviation factor s25\n2\n=0.75 and 0.74 for both simulations in Fig. 7, respectively.\nThe contribution from the critical 10 mm\/min count is re-\nduced by half. However, the errors related to high velocities\nare considerably increased. This is a result of the small sto-\nchastic width that had to be assumed in order to explain the\ndepopulated mean velocity in the in vivo velocity distribu-\ntion. Thus the depopulated mean velocity and the counts of\nvery high and low velocities as observed in vivo rule out the\nhypothesis that TC switch between two velocity states.\nD. T cells with three velocity states\nA similar in silico experiment can be done with three\nvelocity states. The assumption of equal persistence times for\nall three states leads to more pronounced high velocities in\ncontradiction to the two-photon data. However, reducing the\npersistence time of the highest velocity state by a factor of 2\nleads to a more reasonable scenario ssee Fig. 8d. The devia-\ntion factor fsee Eq. s1dg s25\n2\n=0.52 is of similar quality as\ncompared to the single velocity state scenario. The contribu-\ntions to this factor are smoothly distributed over the whole\nvelocity range. Similar results are found when both high ve-\nFIG. 6.

Note that the depopulated\naverage velocity is not reflected in the shape index. The latter\ndisplays a rather large width that is induced by three different\nvelocity states, each corresponding to a different average\nelongation.\nThe persistence of velocity states has to be reduced to 0.5\nminutes in order to obtain the same frequency of velocity\nchanges as in vivo. Representative results with persistence\ntimes that are too long are shown in Fig. 9. Note the small\nstochastic variations around the mean velocity attributed to\nthe various velocity states of the cell. If only one velocity\nstate is assumed the correct frequency of velocity changes is\nbased on the stochastic width of the cell velocities only. In\nthe case of more velocity states, the stochastic width is re-\nduced and the velocity changes are to be interpreted as active\nchanges of the velocity with some frequency.\nAn analogous analysis holds true for BC, which is not\nshown here as it does not add new insights.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented the new model hyphasma for cell mo-\ntility and shaping. Cell shape and movement are reduced to\nthe dynamics of the cell subunits that represent the cell mem-\nbrane. The dynamics are described by two contributions: sid\nRearrangement of subunits with respect to a virtually shifted\nbarycenter of the cell sactive movementd and siid rearrange-\nment of the subunits with respect to the actual barycenter\nsreshaping forcesd. The subunit movement is realized accord-\ning to heuristic rules that are interpretable as physical quan-\ntities.\nFIG. 7.

MAINI PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 061912 s2005d\n061912-10\nThe comparison of the model results with experiment re-\nvealed that these two ingredients, i.e., active movement and\nreshaping forces, are sufficient in order to describe lympho-\ncyte motility data as found by two-photon imaging. Assum-\ning a single velocity state of lymphocytes describes all the\ndata for TC and BC. Thus the model confirms that the move-\nment of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs can be\ndescribed as a random walk with persistence of orientation of\n2 minutes.\nThe dynamics of the shape index found in experiment are\nin large parts inferred by the difference in mean velocities\nbetween TC and BC. This reflects the model assumption that\ncell movements are performed by cell subunit displacements,\ni.e., by cell deformation. However, in order to quantitatively\nreproduce the data within the model the reshaping forces had\nto be doubled for BC with respect to TC. This can neither be\na difference in hydrostatic pressure nor in surface tension of\nthe membrane. The difference has to be interpreted in terms\nof different cytoskeleton dynamics in TC and BC.\nHowever, these results ignore a depopulated mean veloc-\nity in the velocity distribution which is observed in vivo for\nTC. On first sight the data suggest that lymphocytes ran-\ndomly switch between two velocity states. However, assum-\ning two velocity states in silico, the model results clearly\nimply a contradiction between the depopulation of the mean\nvelocity and the total width of the distribution. This contra-\ndiction can only be resolved by assuming an asymmetric\ndistribution of cell velocities around both mean velocities. It\nis difficult to imagine a mechanism that breaks the symmetry\nof the stochastic width, so we consider this scenario to be\nrather unlikely.\nThe depopulated mean velocity observed experimentally\ncan, however, be explained by the assumption of three or\nmore velocity states. The velocity cell distribution is repro-\nduced when the highest velocity state has shorter persistence\ntimes compared to both low velocity states. More generally,\nthe persistence time of all velocity states has to be decoupled\nfrom the persistence time of the orientation sthus implying\ntwo different mechanisms for orientation and velocity state\nregulationd. This is clearly inferred by the variability of the\ntime courses of velocity and shape index: The assumption of\nthree velocity states is possible only if the stochastic width is\nconsiderably reduced. The in vivo variability of the time\ncourses is then restored in silico by a more frequent change\nof velocity states.\nThe latter point implies different interpretations of the\nwidth of the velocity distribution: Either, the depopulated\nmean velocity is ignored and a single velocity state assumed.\nThen the variability of the velocity time courses is a result of\nstochastic width only. Alternatively, the depopulated mean\nvelocity is explained by at least three velocity states of lym-\nphocytes. Then the variability of the velocity time course is a\nresult of an active change of the internal state of the cell\nswith only small stochastic perturbationsd.\nIn real secondary lymphoid tissue, lymphocytes move in a\nlabyrinth of obstacles. We have therefore tested the effect of\nobstacles on the observed cell motility. The result is that the\nstochastic width of the velocity distribution is considerably\nenhanced. For reasonable densities of obstacles the velocity\ndistribution becomes dominated by intermediate velocities.\nThis rather intuitive result favors the scenario that TC and\nBC move in a single velocity state with large stochastic\nwidth. A depopulated mean velocity in the velocity distribu-\ntion becomes rather difficult to reproduce. The purely sto-\nchastic interpretation of the velocity distribution is further\nsupported by the observation that the width of the velocity\ndistribution scales identically in vivo and in silico for single\nvelocity states. In contrast, the stochastic width has to be\nfitted separately susing the parameter hd for TC and BC\nwhen a three velocity state is considered. However, it re-\nmains to be clarified in further experiments whether a de-\npopulated mean velocity represents a real property of lym-\nphocytes.\nThe present in silico experiment enforces the interpreta-\ntion of lymphocyte migration as active and undirected move-\nment with orientation persistence in the range of minutes f6g.\nHowever, we have also seen that a width of a velocity dis-\ntribution may either be a result of stochastic variation or of\ndetermined active changes of internal states. This raises the\nquestion of whether the straight line found for the relation of\nthe distance reached and the square-root of time really points\nto a persistent random walk. Alternatively, one may think of\nit to be the result of a specific and more complex chemotactic\nmovement f13g. Indeed, not only the expression of chemok-\nine receptors but also their pronounced expression on the\nleading edge of migrating cells has been observed in both TC\nand BC f14,15g. The requirements for chemokine sources\nthat lead to a seemingly random walk of lymphocytes in\nlymph nodes remain to be worked out in further in silico\ninvestigations.\nFIG. 9.
