February 2006. \n \nAccording to a popular internet search engine, the phrase \u201caurora borealis\u201d was \namong the top one hundred searched-for terms in the UK in 2005.  At first glance, one \nmight consider this surprising.  After all, the British Isles are not typically associated \nwith the beautiful auroral displays that are commonplace at more northerly locations.  \nWhy then is there so much interest in the so-called \u201cnorthern lights\u201d?   \n \nThe aurora borealis, literally translated as the \u201cnorthern dawn\u201d, has captivated \nonlookers for millennia.  There are countless myths and beliefs that explain the \ndancing lights in the night sky.  The indigenous people of North America believed \nthat if you whistled at the aurora it would sweep down and take you from the Earth \nand only by clapping your hands you could force it to retreat.  Several cultures \nassociated auroral displays with the clashing of great armies in the sky or the restless \nspirits of the dead.  Further south, where aurorae were observed much less frequently, \npeople would have seen the northern lights only once or twice in their lives.  In \nEurope, the strange lights in the sky, especially red aurorae, were usually interpreted \nas omens of impending death, war or the spilling of blood. \n \nTo modern-day observers, the aurora borealis is no less impressive.  It is one of those \nphenomena that really must be seen first-hand as neither still or moving images can \ndo it true justice.  Judging by the number of aurora-watching holidays advertised in \nthe travel sections of the Sunday papers, the aurora borealis still captivates those with \nan adventurous spirit as well as supporting a lucrative travel industry, but is it \nnecessary to travel to the Arctic circle to witness the aurora first hand?  Can the aurora \nborealis be seen from the UK?  Perhaps it is this question that drives people to the \ninternet search engines. \n \nWe now know that aurorae are a direct consequence of the magnetic coupling \nbetween the Sun and the Earth.  Under certain interplanetary conditions, particles of \nsolar origin are able to enter the magnetosphere, the region of near-Earth space \ndominated by the terrestrial magnetic field, from where they have access to the upper \nreaches of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.  Visible aurorae are created when energetic \ncharged particles, mainly electrons, precipitate along magnetic field lines and collide \nwith atmospheric atoms and molecules.  The vast majority of auroral light consists of \nthe emission lines of neutral or ionised O and N2. Although \u01fangstr\u00f6m demonstrated \nin 1866 that the dominant green emission had a wavelength of 557.7 nm, it was not \nuntil 1925 that McLennan and Schrum identified it as the metastable transition of \natomic oxygen from the  to the state.  Another transition line of atomic oxygen \n( ) results in red line emission from the 630.0 \u2013 636.4 nm doublet.  Ionised \nnitrogen molecules are responsible for violet and blue auroral emission lines at \n391.4 nm and 427.8 nm.   \n \nThe metastable or \u201cforbidden\u201d oxygen transitions have relatively long lifetimes \n(0.74 s and 110 s for the green and red lines respectively) and are most prominent in \nthe upper atmosphere.  At these high altitudes, the atmosphere is sufficiently rarefied \nthat collision frequencies are low.  Below about 200 km altitude the red line emissions \nare quenched by collisional de-excitation of the oxygen atom while green line \nemissions are quenched below approximately 120 km.  Nitrogen transitions occur \nmore or less spontaneously and, although weaker than the green and red line \nemissions from atomic oxygen, extend down to about 100 km altitude. \n \nAs well as the composition and density profile of the atmosphere, another key factor \nthat determines the colour of auroral features is the energy of the precipitating \nparticles.  Typical auroral electron energies lie in the range 1-10 keV allowing to \npenetrate the atmosphere to between 150-100 km altitude.  As such, the green line \nemission at 557.7 nm usually dominates the appearance of auroral features to the \nnaked eye.  Soft electrons (less than 1 keV) cannot penetrate far into the atmosphere \nand result in red emissions above about 200 km altitude.  Fluxes of hard electrons \nwith energy greater than 10 keV can travel deep into the atmosphere and  produce a \npink-red fringe at the lower edge of the aurora. \n \nTypically, aurorae are observed within crown-like ovals that surround the northern \nand southern geomagnetic poles.  Usually, the auroral ovals are about 5\u02da of latitude in \nwidth and centred on about 70\u02da magnetic latitude in the midnight sector and slightly \nfurther poleward in the dusk and dawn sectors.  During intervals of high geomagnetic \nactivity the auroral ovals expand equatorward whereas during quiescent periods they \ncontract poleward.  Consequently, the likelihood of observing the aurora at mid-\nlatitudes varies according to the position within the 11-year solar cycle.  Situated \nbetween about 47\u00b0-58\u00b0 magnetic latitude, the UK usually resides within the sub-\nauroral zone located equatorward of the main auroral oval that surrounds the northern \ngeomagnetic pole.  However, on average we can expect to see visible aurora over the \nUK a couple of times per year, albeit with a preference toward the northern parts of \nthe country. \n \nThe AuroraWatch programme is a real-time service that alerts subscribers when \ngeomagnetic conditions are likely to result in aurora over the UK.  Launched in \nSeptember 2000, AuroraWatch operates under the auspices of SAMNET - the UK \nsub-auroral magnetometer network.  SAMNET is a UK National Facility for Solar \nTerrestrial Physics funded by the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council.  \nOriginally deployed and operated by the University of York, SAMNET has been \noperated by Lancaster University since April 2003.  Specifically, Lancaster University \noperates five stations equipped with fluxgate magnetometers which continuously \nrecord natural variations in the Earth's magnetic field at 1-second resolution.  In \naddition, 1-second resolution data from five magnetometers of the International \nMonitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE) network and  three British \nGeological Survey magnetometers are also archived.  Thus, SAMNET comprises \nthirteen ground magnetometers spanning the sub-auroral zone and stretching \napproximately 2,000 miles from Borok in Russia to Hella in Iceland.  These \nmagnetometers are sensitive to magnetic field disturbances caused by electrical \ncurrents flowing in the ionosphere.  As such they form a crucial component of the \nworldwide network of ground magnetometer stations used for the investigation of the \ncomplex interactions within the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere \nsystem.  SAMNET\u2019s mid-latitude location makes it particularly suitable for the \ninvestigation of ionospheric currents and characteristic wave pulsations associated \nwith magnetospheric substorms \u2013 the explosive release of solar wind energy stored in \nthe Earth\u2019s magnetotail that results in spectacular aurora in the high-latitude auroral \nzone. \n \nAuroraWatch draws upon real-time data from the SAMNET magnetometer located at \nYork (50.8\u02da magnetic latitude).  The components of the local magnetic field vector \npointing toward magnetic north (H-component), vertically downward (the Z-\ncomponent) and magnetic east-west (D-component) are measured at 1-second \nresolution and passed via the internet to the AuroraWatch system.  From these data, a \nreal-time activity plot is generated showing geomagnetic conditions over the \npreceding 24 hours(figure 1).  These plots shows the H-component of the field as a \nblack line, with a typical quiet day shown in blue.  The difference between the \nobserved field and a quiet day is plotted as a colour-coded bar chart: green for quiet, \norange for active and red for stormy. \n \nVarious different stages of magnetic activity show up in H-component data. For \nexample, as a coronal mass ejection (CME) hits the front side of the magnetosphere, \nthe compression of the magnetic field produces an increase in the northward magnetic \nfield measured at ground level. This gives a characteristic rise in the field and is \nknown as a Sudden Storm Commencement (SSC). Not all SSCs are followed by \nauroral activity at mid-latitudes, but it is a good early indicator. If the solar wind \nspeed and interplanetary magnetic field direction are favourable, energy will gradually \nbuild up in the magnetosphere resulting into a large geomagnetic storm, with the \nmagnetic field decreasing and changing rapidly.  It should be noted that the \nterminology of storms and substorms is somewhat misleading.  Substorms are not \nsmall storms - storms may include several magnetospheric substorms as well as long \nquiescent periods.  Nevertheless, geomagnetic storms probably present the UK aurora \nwatcher\u2019s best chance for success. \n \nAuroraWatch alerts correspond to the status colour coding indicated in Figure 1.  A \nred alert indicates that geomagnetic conditions are sufficiently disturbed that aurorae \nare likely over the UK while an amber alert corresponds to moderate activity and a \nlower likelihood of aurora.  When signing up for alerts, subscribers can elect to \nreceive both amber and red alerts or red alerts only.  The AuroraWatch alert takes the \nform of a short email with the alert status given in the subject line.  As such, \nsubscribers can take advantage of the free email forwarding services offered by most \nmobile phone networks and have AuroraWatch alerts forwarded as an SMS text \nmessages directly to their mobile phone. \n \nThere is clearly huge public interest in the aurora within the UK and the AuroraWatch \nprogramme has been highly successful - in October 2005, AuroraWatch recorded its \n20,000th subscriber.  Of course, not every alert results in a spectacular auroral display \nand where you live can dramatically improve or reduced the chances of a successful \nnight\u2019s aurora-spotting.  Bright streetlights from large towns or cities will overpower \nfaint aurora.  However, as demonstrated by figures 2 and 3, it isn\u2019t necessary to travel \nfar from urban areas in order to stand a good chance of spotting the northern lights \ngiven the right geomagnetic conditions (although aurora watchers who live in the \nrural north of the UK are more likely to see an auroral display than those inside the \nM25!).  As we are currently, approaching a minimum in the 11-year cycle of solar \nactivity it is expected that auroral displays over the UK will be at their most \ninfrequent.  Nevertheless, based upon photographs taken by AuroraWatch subscribers, \nit is known that clear aurorae were observed on at least two nights in 2005.  The \nAuroraWatch gallery is full of images taken by AuroraWatch subscribers from as far \nnorth as the Shetland Isles to the south coast of England \u2013 all it takes is a fine night \nand a little luck! \n \n \nMore information can be found at the AuroraWatch website \nhttp:\/\/aurorawatch.lancs.ac.uk\/ \n \nDr Jim Wild (j.wild@lancaster.ac.uk), Space Plasma Environment & Radio Science \nGroup, Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University. \nQuotations \n \n\u201cI've wanted to see the northern lights all my life and thanks to your set up and red \nalert sent out, myself, my wife and our children went into the countryside not far from \nwhere we live in Ulverston last night and caught a wonderful display which will live \nlong in the memory.\u201d \nStephen Anderson-Bass \n \n\u201cJust seen the aurora for the first time, from the outskirts of Newcastle, absolutely \nfantastic!!!!\u201c \n Hilda Frost  \n \n\u201cI was extremely fortunate to see a fine aurora in a country area  outside \nAbergavenny, South Wales last night (10 November 04) at about 20:00 GMT - right \nwhen your display predicted one!
