We discuss here three problematic notions \u2013 \u201ctheory,\u201d \u201cground\u201d and \u201cdiscovery\u201d \u2013 \nwhich linger in the continuing use and development of grounded theory procedures.

The procedures admittedly provide signposts for qualitative inquirers, but \neducational researchers should be wary, for the significance of interpretation, narrative and \nreflection can be undermined in the procedures of grounded theory.  \n \n \n \n 2 \nREINVENTING GROUNDED THEORY: SOME QUESTIONS \nABOUT THEORY, GROUND AND DISCOVERY  \nGrounded theory was developed and established nearly forty years ago by Barney Glaser and Anselm \nStrauss. Their 1967 book The Discovery of Grounded Theory laid out a set of procedures for the \ngeneration of theory from empirical data. There can be little doubt that it has been a major \u2013 perhaps \nthe major \u2013 contributor to the acceptance of the legitimacy of qualitative methods in applied social \nresearch.  \n \nThe origins and context of this seminal work are important. It was conceived at time when symbolic \ninteractionism was suffering a decline, partly due to what some saw as its celebration of liberal \nindividualism, but principally due to pincer-like pressure from, as Alvesson and Sk\u00f6ldberg (2000) put \nit, \u201cthe \u2015hard\u2016 methods such as statistical method and structural functionalism on the one hand, and \ncompetition from the \u2015soft\u2016 side in the form of ethnomethodology \u2026 on the other\u201d (p. 13).  Seen \nhistorically, grounded theory represented a resolution of different epistemological positions\n1 and a \nsolution to a broader problem about perceptions of the status of qualitatively based knowledge in the \nsocial sciences. \n  \nFour decades on, grounded theory continues to be used in a wide range of research settings, and is \nespecially highly regarded as a method of social analysis in fields such as education and health studies\n2\n. \nDespite much critique, it continues to enjoy great kudos amongst educators, to the extent that its use \ncan still seemingly validate the publication of a study\u2016s findings (see, for example, Harry et al, 2005). \nStrauss and Corbin (1997) summarize the contemporary status of grounded theory when they say that \ngrounded theory\u2016s methods are \u201c\u2026 now among the most influential and widely used modes of carrying \nout qualitative research when generating theory is the researcher\u2016s principal aim\u201d (p. vii). \n \nThere can be little doubt that Strauss and Corbin are accurate when they make this large assertion. As \nMiller and Fredericks (1999) put it, the grounded theory approach has become the \u201cparadigm of \nchoice\u201d for qualitative researchers in education and other disciplines. And as Denzin (1994, p. 508) has \nnoted, \u201cThe grounded theory perspective is the most widely used qualitative interpretive framework \nin the social sciences today.\u201d \n \nGrounded theory, and other techniques of analysis in qualitative inquiry, are bound to be popular, \nbecause they meet a need. For while qualitative inquiry is absolutely valid, it is difficult to do. In \neducation it may involve talking \u2013 as naturally as possible \u2013 with students, parents, teachers; it may \nentail taking part, watching and listening, in schools and other environments. But when all this is \n 3 \ndone, what comes next? Such ways of doing research can lead to a floating feeling, a lack of direction. \nWhat does one do with one\u2016s data? Surely one can\u2016t just talk about it. Grounded theory offers a \nsolution: a set of procedures, and a means of generating theory. As such, it has become widely used \nand its reputation as an accessible and thoroughly explained method in qualitative inquiry has grown \nand grown. \n \nThe purpose of this article is to challenge the continuing legitimacy of grounded theory and the lofty \nplace its methods have come to hold in social and institutional analysis. We dispute grounded theory\u2016s \nstatus as theory, and the assertion that it can be \u2015discovered\u2016; we contest its claim to be consistent with \nthe tenets of qualitative inquiry, and we question its claims to produce better predictive and \nexplanatory outcomes than other methods. \n \nCertain of these criticisms develop out of the work of others, and it is necessary first to acknowledge \nexisting critiques of grounded theory and to note our points of similarity and difference with them. In \nbrief, these criticisms centre on three broad themes: first, that grounded theory oversimplifies complex \nmeanings and interrelationships in data; second, that it constrains analysis, putting the cart (procedure) \nbefore the horse (interpretation), and third that it depends upon inappropriate models of induction \nand asserts from them equally inappropriate claims to explanation and prediction. Let us look at some \nof the critical literature which exemplifies this debate, and indicate both our points of agreement and \nsuggested foci for development. \n \nLayder (1993) identifies four limitations. First, he says, a grounded theory approach has the effect of \nhighlighting the immediately apparent and observable at the expense of attending to the interweaving \nof structural features of social situations with activities. Second, he argues that the focus on the \u201chere \nand now of everyday encounters\u201d limits the concept of power that is possible in the approach. Third, \nhe contends that the development of theory in a grounded theory approach should be more guided by \ndata than limited by it. And last, he suggests that the insistence that grounded theory should be \nrecognizable to the people studied (encapsulated in the notions of \u201cfit\u201d and \u201crelevance\u201d) places \nunhelpful constraints on analysis because it rules out features and interpretations which they could not \nbe expected to have considered. \n \nOthers, such as Haig (1995), have queried grounded theory\u2016s reliance on a na\u00efve model of scientific \ninduction, inappropriate to the tenets of qualitative inquiry. Haig, together with others such as Miller \nand Fredericks (1999) point to what one might call the \u201ceverydayness\u201d of inductive reasoning. The \nthrust of their argument is that this common, everyday induction is better described as \u201cinference to \n 4 \nthe best explanation\u201d or what C.S. Peirce called \u201cabduction.\u201d This critique, and in particular the \ndistinction drawn between looser and tighter kinds of induction, is important to this article and it is \nexpanded in more detail later. \n \nRobrecht (1995) notes that the elaboration of sampling procedures by Strauss and Corbin (which \ninclude instructions for techniques for open sampling, relational and variational sampling and \ndiscriminate sampling) divert attention from the data toward techniques and procedures. As Robrecht \nputs it, these elaborations encourage researchers \u201cto look for data rather than look at data\u201d (p. 171, \noriginal emphases). She recommends an alternative approach: that of Leonard Schatzman (1991), \nwhich seeks to extend the natural analytic process of everyday thinking by systematically examining \ndifferent concepts that might be used to summarize events. The emphasis on that natural analytic \nprocess is a significant one and is a theme that will be rehearsed throughout this article. \n \nA comprehensive list of criticisms is made by Dey (1999), who presents a host of ambiguities, \nconfusions and unanswered questions. For example, he illustrates how tensions in the original \nformulation of the approach are revealed in the gulf that developed between the originators (see \nGlaser, 1992), such that the role of verification remains a \u201cpuzzle\u201d and the role of prior theory is \nunclear. Despite this critique, though, Dey maintains a surprising degree of optimism \u2013 even faith \u2013 in \nthe approach. He sees grounded theory as capable of development and as offering a \u201cmiddle way\u201d \nbetween ideographic and nomothetic theorizing.  \n \nCharmaz has over two decades been a developer of new forms of grounded theory (e.g. Charmaz, \n1988; 2000) and her voice has been lucid in enabling its evolution. Some years ago, she offered a \ndevelopment of grounded theory which depended on an endorsement of five principles which kept \nfaith with \u201cthe form and logic\u201d of the Glaser and Strauss approach. Those five principles were: the \nstructuring of inquiry; the simultaneity of data collection and analysis; the generation of new theory \nrather than the verification of existing theory; the refinement and exhaustion of conceptual categories \nthrough theoretical sampling, and the direction to \u201cmore abstract analytic levels\u201d (1988, p. 125). More \nrecently she has asserted that \u201cgrounded theory can bridge traditional positivistic methods with \ninterpretative methods\u201d (Charmaz, 1995, p. 30). She rejects the claims to disinterestedness and \nobjectivity present in earlier versions of grounded theory, noting that \u201cThe myth of silent authorship \nis false but reassuring\u201d (Charmaz and Mitchell, 1996, p. 299). She distinguishes between \u201cobjectivist\u201d \nand \u201cconstructivist\u201d grounded theory, aligning the former with \u201c\u2026awkward scientistic terms and \nclumsy categories\u201d (Charmaz, 2000, p. 525). The result may be \u201c\u2026an overly complex architecture that \nobscures experience\u201d (ibid.). She offers a \u201csimplified, constructivist version of grounded theory\u201d (p. \n 5 \n514); \u201cEmphases on action and process and, from my constructivist point of view, meaning and \nemergence within symbolic interactionism complement grounded theory.\u201d (p. 513)  \n \nThese latter are helpful developments in the move to open qualitative inquiry, faithful to the thinking \nwhich gave rise to it and continues to inspire it. However, we challenge the need to call these forms of \nqualitative inquiry \u201cgrounded theory\u201d and we suggest that in so doing \u2013 in continuing to want to call \nthem \u201cgrounded theory\u201d with the corollary of the continued adherence to its precepts and techniques \n\u2013 there proceed two unwelcome sequelae. First, the claims of qualitative inquiry to be taken seriously \nin its own right (without the use of special method) are undermined, and second, unwelcome \nconstraints on open, creative interpretation are imposed. We discuss this in more detail toward the end \nof this article. \n \nWe take issue here with the conciliatory nature of the critical discourse about grounded theory. Dey \nseeks his \u201cmiddle way.\u201d Layder seeks an \u201camended\u201d grounded theory with a broader scope, ending up \nwith a \u201crealist approach\u201d or \u201cadaptive theory\u201d (Layder, 1993; 1998) \u2013 which looks (at least to us) very \nmuch like grounded theory. Likewise, Haig looks for ways around the critique he outlines in an \nadaptation of grounded theory. Charmaz proceeds with a constructivist version of grounded theory \nwhich \u201ctakes a middle ground between postmodernism and positivism\u201d (2000, p. 510). Unlike these \ncritics, though, we cannot see how there can be a \u201cmiddle way\u201d or new versions. For us, the problems \nwith grounded theory preclude any possibility of modification or retrenchment. \n \nOur arguments about the pretensions of grounded theory in education centre on a number of \ninterrelated issues concerning the three key words in the seminal text: \u201ctheory, \u201cdiscovery\u201d and, \nunderpinning both, the notion of \u201cground.\u201d  In examining these we shall draw upon the concerns of \nother critics \u2013 for instance, about claims to prediction \u2013 but attempt to integrate the concerns of those \ncritics in what we consider to be some problematic issues concerning theory and discovery. It is the \nsidestepping of these major concerns that leads to continued attempts to re-clothe and revitalize \ngrounded theory. Underpinning both of these concerns about theory and discovery are considerations \nabout ground \u2013 which we see as a metaphor for some implicit assumptions about the mind of the \nresearcher and about social reality, what we can know about it, and how we can arrive at that \nknowledge. \u201cGround,\u201d with its intimations of solidity and fixity, simply does not mix with \n\u201cconstruction,\u201d with its contrasting intimations of the tenuous, the mutable, the interpreted. \n 6 \nTheory \nWhy is grounded theory \u201ctheory?\u201d \n\u201cTheory\u201d has not formed a major focus in the critique of grounded theory. Yet the claim for grounded \ntheory actually to be theory raises some questions about what it is to be theory, what is demanded and \nexpected of theory, and why people expect their methods-for-making-sense to be called \u201ctheory.\u201d  \n \nIn the preface of The Discovery of Grounded Theory, Glaser and Strauss justify the project of their book \nby noting that the interpretative sociologists of the Chicago tradition are associated with \u201can \nunintegrated presentation of theory\u201d (p. vii). At the very outset, then, something interesting emerges \nabout these authors\u2016 views concerning knowledge and how it should be pursued. This can be \nsummarized roughly as follows: qualitative research is valid, appropriate and necessary, but it does \nitself no favours by having no methodology to speak of, and by being unable to demonstrate how it \ndevelops theory. The latter \u2013 the development of theory \u2013 seems to be viewed as the sine qua non of \nserious inquiry. \n \nGiven the widespread use of grounded theory as a method of qualitative inquiry, it is important to \nrecognize the character of the theory that Glaser, Strauss and their successors (for example, Charmaz, \nop cit) have consistently said they are seeking here. Much of the importance of theory development for \nthem concerns notions of induction: theory is taken to be part of the canonical apparatus which allow \nus to make inferences and proffer explanations based on inductive processes.  \n \nDeep water is being traversed here. The issue of what theory might be in qualitative inquiry in is a \ntricky one (see for example Woods, 1992), since the word \u201ctheory\u201d has taken a wide variety of \nmeanings, loose and tight, particularly in educational discourse. It can mean systems of evolving \nexplanation, personal reflection, orienting principle, epistemological presupposition, developed \nargument, craft knowledge, and more (see, for example, Scheffler, 1967; Chambers, 1992; Thomas, \n1997). It is not, of course, only in education that one finds these definitional conundrums aired. In \nsociological discourse, widely differing conceptions on the nature of theory are to be found, even in \nthe same volume (compare, for example \u2013 all in the same book \u2013 Martindale, 1979; Cicourel, 1979; \nSnizek, 1979).  \n \nGiven the plurality of view on this issue of theory, it is not surprising that Stanley Fish (1989) rejects \nthe meaningfulness of any of this discourse. He contends that such discourse about theory in the \nacademy is not really about theory at all, but rather about \u201ctheory talk\u201d \u2013 that is, \u201cany form of talk \n 7 \nthat has acquired cachet and prestige\u201d (1989, pp. 14-15). He surely has a point and it is necessary here \nto try to draw on some of this definitional discussion, since \u2013 in the invocation of theory and the \ncachet it brings with it for inquiry \u2013 important issues about finding out, discovery, explanation and \nprediction are at stake. Are the theoretical claims of grounded theory valid? Why should grounded \ntheorists want, in \u201cdiscovering\u201d something, to call that which is discovered \u201ctheory?\u201d \n \nMiller and Fredericks (1999, p. 539) offer some help here. They say that it is possible to see grounded \ntheory in three main ways: i) as an approach in \u201cthe logic of discovery;\u201d ii) as being either \n\u201caccommodationist or predictivist;\u201d iii) as a variant of \u201cinference to the best explanation.\u201d This is a \nuseful setting of scene, though we would prefer for simplicity\u2016s sake to reframe their taxonomy thus: \ntheory can, broadly speaking, be seen as being about a) inspiration involving patterning or \naccommodation (see, for example, Kaplan, 1964, p. 332, for a discussion of patterning); b) explanation \nand prediction. In its former, looser, sense it is principally about bringing ideas together, while in its \nlatter, tighter form it adheres to positivist and functionalist expectations about explanation. The use of \nthe word \u201ctheory\u201d as though it described one inductionist process camouflages the confusion occurring \nhere, and it enables further confusions to occur about the purposes of qualitative inquiry. \n \nThe \u201ctheoretical\u201d notion in grounded theory, in other words, conflates and confuses two processes in \ninquiry. It conjoins the spark to inspiration \u2013 exemplified in K\u00f6hler\u2016s apes\u2016 \u201cAh Ha!\u201d (K\u00f6hler, 1925) or \nArchimedes\u2016s \u201cEureka!\u201d \u2013 with the predictive function of theory in the natural sciences and in \nfunctionalism. For describing what happens in qualitative research, the use of the term \u201ctheory\u201d only \nconfuses what is going on. The former type \u2013 involving tacit patterning, interpretation and inspiration \u2013 \nis really a vernacular employment of the term \u201ctheory\u201d (\u201cI have a theory why my geraniums are dying\u201d), \nand is part of everyday reasoning and Schatzman\u2016s (1991, p. 304) \u201ccommon interpretive acts.\u201d The latter \nis about generalization following systematic and extensive data collection, and the testing of the \ngeneralization for the purposes of verification or falsification.  \n \nThus, to the question of Miller and Fredericks (1999) \u201cHow does grounded theory explain?\u201d we would \nanswer, \u201cIt doesn\u2016t,\u201d because grounded theory procedures are a scion of qualitative inquiry, and \nqualitative inquiry is about interpretation. It is about \u2013 using Ricoeur\u2016s (1970, p. 33) well known \ndistinction \u2013 understanding before explanation. But on both counts, the former and the latter, theory \nas discovery and theory as part of an explanatory exercise, grounded theory fails to live up to its \nproponents\u2016 expectations. It fails because it promises too much \u2013 because it is unsatisfied with \u201cmere\u201d \nunderstanding. \n \n 8 \nWe explore the claims to \u201cdiscovery\u201d below (under Discovery or invention?), but it is perhaps worth \nnoting here some concern about the linking of theory and discovery when discovery is taken to mean \ncreativity or finding out. In grounded theory one sees signposts to investigatory avenues borrowed \nfrom natural scientific endeavour, but one should note here that natural scientists, whose notionally \ninductive-predictive theory is that commended by grounded theorists to the present day, hold far less \nfirmly nowadays to the procedural guyropes they once cherished. Beck, a Nobel prize winning \nphysicist noted that \u201cThe mechanics of discovery are not known \u2026 I think that the creative process is \nso closely tied in with the emotional structure of an individual \u2026 that  \u2026 it is a poor subject for \ngeneralization\u201d (cited by Wright Mills 1970, p. 69). Thought actually moves forward, Feyerabend \n(1993) asserted, by \u201ca maze of interactions \u2026 by accidents and conjunctures and curious juxtapositions \nof events.\u201d Similarly, Einstein noted that the creative scientist must be an \u201cunscrupulous opportunist\u201d \nand that the essence of science is the seeking \u201cin whatever manner is suitable, a simplified and lucid \nimage of the world \u2026 There is no logical path, but only intuition\u201d (cited in Holton, 1995, p. 168). In \nother words, Feyerabend concludes, \u201cthe only principle that does not inhibit progress is anything goes\u201d \n(1993, p. 14).  \n \nOne must be careful, in other words, that in creating something called \u201ctheory\u201d (together with a set of \nprocedural accompaniments for finding it) one does not inhibit rather than liberate discovery. One \nmust be careful that fertility is not sacrificed to orderliness. Theory, if Einstein is right, does not give \nbirth to discovery: it patterns, systematizes and tidies cognitive leaps, having painstakingly employed the \n\u201cinference tickets\u201d of Ryle (of which more below); it cannot act as a vehicle for creativity. \n \nTheory in a loose, vernacular sense \u2013 to go back to \u201cI have a theory why my geraniums are dying\u201d \u2013 is \nindeed about conjecture, and, if you like, about creativity. But this is far from what happens when \ntheory is used scientifically \u2013 in natural or social science, a matter which Cicourel (1979) recognizes in \nhis distinction between the \u201cweak theory\u201d associated with the inductive assumptions of field research, \nand \u201cstrong theory.\u201d Charmaz (1995, p. 28) also implicitly recognizes a distinction of this kind in her \nacknowledgement that grounded theory represents what she calls \u201cmiddle range theories to explain \nbehavior and processes.\u201d The \u201cexplain\u201d is the problematic word here. \u201cMiddle range,\u201d \u201cweak,\u201d \n\u201cprotoscientific\u201d or vernacular theories do not explain anything, since the sophisticated \u201cinference \nticket\u201d procedures (described in the following section) are not present to enable it. Instead, they help \nus to understand. Understanding is a no less worthy ambition and there is a paradox in grounded \ntheorists\u2016 continuing strivings for explanation. \n \n 9 \nStaying on theory as creativity for a moment, the problem comes for grounded theory (or indeed \nalmost any theory in the social sciences) in claiming some status for one\u2016s theory (\u201cmiddle range,\u201d \n\u201cweak\u201d or \u201cprotoscientific\u201d) as an instrument which works beyond the level of one\u2016s everyday \npatterning generalization and practical syllogism \u2013 beyond Polanyi\u2016s (1958) personal knowledge or the \n\u201ceveryday knowledge\u201d of Schutz and Luckmann (1974). For theory to be worth something, it must \ninvolve something more than these everyday patternings and tacit heuristic exercises, for such \npatternings and such exercises are what human beings do all the time par excellence. As Schatzman \n(1991) notes, we are all the time using \u201ccommon interpretive acts\u201d (p. 304) and unselfconsciously using \nthese to help us order and comprehend the world. We all see links, discover patterns, make \ngeneralizations, create explanatory propositions \u2013 weak theory, if you like \u2013 all the time, emerging out \nof our experience, and this is all \u201cempirical.\u201d The problems come when too much is claimed for it, \nsimply because it is empirical; problems come in distinguishing generalization from over-\ngeneralization, narrative from induction. As Bertrand Russell (1956) notes on theorizing and \ninduction, the person who theorizes that unsupported bodies in air fall, in fact \u201chas merely generalised, \nand is liable to be refuted by balloons, butterflies and aeroplanes\u201d (p. 91). Alasdair MacIntyre (1981, p. \n91) suggests that social science\u2016s generalisations are not generalisations in any meaningful sense \u2013 that is to \nsay, \u2015they are not only not genuinely of the form \u201cFor all x and some y if x has property \u03c6, then y has \nproperty \u03c8,\u201d but we cannot say of them in any precise way under what conditions they hold\u2016. Devotees \nof grounded theory have yet to make a case that their kind of theory possesses characteristics of \ninduction in the way that natural scientists\u2016 theories may.  \n \nThe epistemological weapons of \u201ccreative theory,\u201d in other words, have to offer more than natural \neveryday analytic skill, yet one cannot be confident that they will ever do such. Indeed, as Geertz (1975) \nsays, the marriage of subjectivism to formalism which such expectations for theory involve, often \nresult in sterile debate about whether \u201canalyses \u2026 in the form of taxonomies, paradigms, tables, trees, \nand other ingenuities \u2026 are merely clever simulations\u201d (p. 11). What more, in other words, does any of \nthis kind of theorizing give over and above our everyday theorizing? How does grounded theory stand \nabove the patterning of our everyday lives and everyday experience? One has to caution against the \npossibility that, as Miller and Fredericks (ibid) put it \u201c\u2026 grounded theory is basically a way of making \nan inductive argument dressed up in a new label\u201d (p. 548).  \nTheory: riding two horses \nBefore looking in detail in the next section at claims to induction one needs to examine a more general \nrespect for theory in qualitative research \u2013 a respect to which seekers of grounded theory appear to be \nprey. Such an examination exposes for scrutiny a kind of reasoning which leads to the belief that \ntheory is essential to qualitative and ethnographic endeavour. The source of this is a confusion noted \n 10 \nby Mouzelis (1995): it is rooted in a blurring of the distinction we make above about \ninspiration\/patterning versus explanation\/prediction. He too points out that there are essentially two \nkinds of theory used by social scientists and that the refusal to distinguish between the two (or, more \nlikely, the neglect to make the distinction) \u201c\u2026 has social scientists talking at cross purposes\u201d (p. 2). The \ntwo kinds of theory are: i) theory as tools for thinking or, as Nadel (1957) put it, tools \u201cwhich serve to \nmap out the problem area\u201d (p. 1), and ii) theory as a set of statements telling us something new about \nthe social world and which can be proved or disproved by empirical investigation. Mouzelis proceeds \nto note that the separation is similar to that made by Althusser when he set out to distinguish between \ntheory as a tool\/means, which he termed \u201cGeneralities II,\u201d and theory as a provisional end-product: \n\u201cGeneralities III\u201d (Althusser, 1969, pp. 183-90). A similar distinction is drawn by Bourdieu, who says \n\u201c\u2026 I never set out to \u2015do theory\u2016 or to \u2015construct a theory\u2016 per se \u2026 There is no doubt a theory in my \nwork, or, better, a set of thinking tools visible through the results they yield.\u201d (Bourdieu, in Wacquant, \n1989, p. 50, emphasis in original; and see Grenfell and James, 1998, pp. 152-158) \n \nWhat certain of the theorists of qualitative inquiry want to do is to ride two horses at once. They \nwant, borrowing Mouzelis\u2016s (1995) words, to avoid \u201cunfashionable functionalist vocabulary \u2026 while \nretaining its fundamental logic \u2013 with the result that crypto-functionalist elements and related \ndistinctions are clandestinely reintroduced into their writings\u201d (p. 7). The problems come in the \nlinking of theory \u2013 with its intimations of regularity and generality \u2013 to induction. But, as Hans-Georg \nGadamer (1975) suggests, \u201c\u2026 one has not grasped the nature of the human sciences if one measures \nthem by the yardstick of an increasing knowledge of regularity. The experience of the socio-historical \nworld cannot be raised to a science by the inductive procedure of the natural sciences\u201d (p. 6). Or, as \nHoward Becker (1993) puts it, more bluntly, \u201cWho are we kidding with all this science talk?\u201d (p. 218). \n \nThe essential problem here, then, is in the conflating of the expectations of one kind of theory with \nanother. The problem is claiming that one set of natural processes of understanding and patterning \nwith the claims to explanation found in natural science. The problem is with \u201ccrypto-functionalism.\u201d \nBut one might add in parenthesis here that the odd thing about grounded theorists\u2016 exposition is that \nthere is nothing at all \u201ccrypto\u201d or clandestine about the reintroduction of the functionalist elements. \nFar from being in any way hidden, the functionalist elements are central: they are written in big red \nletters. Grounded theory is functionalism incarnate. Far from being embarrassed about it, Glaser and \nStrauss make much of grounded theory\u2016s reputed success in providing \u201crelevant predictions, \nexplanations, interpretations and applications\u201d (1967, p. 1). And their successors make claims that are \nscarcely weaker. \n \n 11 \nStirred in with all this \u201cscience talk\u201d \u2013 indeed, central to it for both for Glaser and Strauss and for \nnewer exponents such as Charmaz (1995, p. 27) \u2013 is the linking of theory with inductive reasoning. It \nis this to which we now turn. \nTheory and the inductive reasoning claim \nAs we have noted, proponents of grounded theory make much of the place of grounded theorizing in \nthe repertoire of inductive inquiry (as distinct from what they call \u201clogically deduced\u201d theory). What \nproponents of grounded theory are claiming here is that grounded theory, once established, will \noccupy a privileged epistemic place. The problem, they say, with work which depends on \u201clogically \ndeduced\u201d theory is that the cart comes before the horse: a previously contrived theory is confirmed \nwith evidence. The spark to action in that way of going about things comes from previously devised \ntheory \u2013 then researchers, untrained in the ways of inductive inquiry, go out and merely verify their \ntheories through the collection of data. This, grounded theorists claim, is the wrong way round. \nConsistent with the tenets of inductive reasoning, grounded theorists dispassionately gather the data \nand then pull the strand cleanly from it. The theory emerges from the data. \n \nTheir confidence about the legitimacy and usefulness of the separation of one kind of thinking and \ninquiry from another \u2013 inductive from deductive \u2013 is perhaps a product of the time in which pioneers \nGlaser and Strauss were writing, but the reliance on the importance of the inductive continues in more \nrecent expositions (for example, Charmaz, 1988; Strauss and Corbin, 1998). With the continuing \nprominence given to this inductive notion, it is worth spending a moment or two on the genealogy of \nthinking about the \u201ccorrectness\u201d of inquiry methods, for this separation of correct from incorrect, of \ninductive from deductive, was symptomatic of a more general tendency in the social sciences in the \n1960s and 70s to assume that there was a Right Way of thinking and of inquiry. For example, many \npsychologists of the 1960s and 70s were, like Glaser and Strauss, confident about inductive method \nwhen they celebrated the psychological offer to education. The distinguished behavioural psychologist \nStanley Bijou (1970) confidently held up empirico-inductive inquiry (as distinct from the more suspect \nhypothetico-deductive inquiry) in telling the world \u201cWhat psychology has to offer education \u2013 now\u201d \n(p. 65). Inductive analysis is held up with pride, almost as a badge of office for the serious social \nanalyst.  \n \nBut people tend to talk with less certainty now about the relative benefits of one kind of method over \nanother. Even back then, though, a third of a century ago, more reflective social scientists were \nwondering whether indeed notions like induction were in fact at all useful in the human arena. Even \nthen, for example, respected psychologist Sigmund Koch (1964) could say:  \n 12 \nIn every period of our history we psychologists have looked to external sources in the \nscholarly culture \u2013 especially natural science and the philosophy of science \u2013 for our sense of \ndirection. And typically we have embraced policies long out of date in those very sources \u2026 \n(pp. 4-5) \nA realization has been dawning that the processes of discovery are not as discrete and separable as the \nuse of terms like \u201cinductive theory\u201d and \u201clogically induced\u201d imply, something about which Popper \n(1989) wrote so forcefully. Popper asserted that science advances not by induction but by a process of \n\u201cconjectures and refutations.\u201d It is imagination and creativity, not induction, that generates real \nscientific theories, Popper suggested, which is how Einstein could study the universe and change \nphysics with little more than a piece of chalk. As Popper (ibid) put it \u201cThe belief that we use induction \nis simply a mistake. It is a kind of optical illusion.\u201d \n \n The prescient sociologist Wright Mills (1970), also writing, it should be noted, at the same time as \nBijou and Glaser and Strauss, quotes a number of Nobel Prize-winning physicists on the fluid and \nunbounded nature of thinking, even in that \u201chard\u201d reductionist science. One of these says (in the \ngendered language of the time, for which, apologies) that \u201cThere is no scientific method as such, but \nthe vital feature of the scientist\u2016s procedure has been merely to do his utmost with his mind, no holds \nbarred\u201d [original emphasis] (Wright Mills 1970, p. 69).  \n \nIt is worth stressing the continuation of this theme in scientists\u2016 discussions of inductive method. The \ntone is one self-effacement rather than certainty. The renowned biologist Peter Medawar is specific in \nhis doubt about the supposed benefits of induction, noting that \u201c\u2026 the influence of inductivism \u2026 has \nin the main been mischievous\u201d (1982, p. 81) in its effects on social scientists. This is mainly because, he \nsays, there is little real distinction in fact to be made between deductivism and inductivism. These \nwords merely relate to \u201cpostures we choose to be seen in when the curtain goes up and the public sees \nus.\u201d (ibid. p. 88). Diffidence is the hallmark of the modern natural scientist when it comes to reflection \non method. \n \nBut such diffidence, such tentativeness, about ways of finding out is not for grounded theorists: \ninduction is good, and it is bound together with prediction in their thesis. And it is important to \nremember that faith in these tenets continues (see Strauss and Corbin, 1997, 1998). Induction is good, \nevidently, because it enables one to derive theory which will, in turn, enable one to order and to \npredict.  \n \n 13 \nLet us unravel the implications of this a little further. It all depends on what is meant by \u201cpredict\u201d in \nour educational worlds, and whether the \u201ctheory\u201d that emerges can predict any better than our \neveryday judgments, or better indeed than any formula that will \u2013 by good luck \u2013 accurately predict. \nPtolemy constructed an intricate calculus, increasingly refined with all sorts of bells and whistles \n(\u201cepicycles\u201d and \u201cequants\u201d), for explaining and predicting the anomalous movement of the planets in \nwhat he assumed to be an earth-centred universe (see Russell, 1991). It was accurate enough \u2013 more \naccurate, indeed, than early Copernican calculations could manage \u2013 yet few would now be persuaded \nthat the accuracy of his predictions added any veracity at all to his geocentric theory. Predictive \naccuracy does not make for explanatory veracity. On its own it\u2016s not enough: it doesn\u2016t provide what \nRyle (1990) calls an inference ticket. \n \nThere is a difference between the noticing of an association and the confident issuing of an inference \nticket. This difference is important, for we are invited to take grounded theory seriously precisely \nbecause theory \u2013 the jewel in epistemology\u2016s crown \u2013 is being established. We are talking, remember, \nabout theory\u2016s power, according to Glaser and Strauss, in enabling \u201c\u2026 predictions, explanations, \ninterpretations and applications\u201d and the claim to explanation is no less muted in today\u2016s grounded \ntheorists. We are not, in other words, talking about garden-variety noticing, or about everyday \ngeneralization.  \n \nThe claim being advanced here is that grounded theory provides us with something more secure \nepistemologically than everyday noticing. It provides more, for example, than simply the modest \n\u201cepistemic sieve\u201d spoken of by Crews (1997) or the everyday \u201cprotoscientific\u201d theory spoken about by \nRussell (1992).\n3\n In place of these weak contrivances, a power-tool is being proffered which works at a \nlevel above and beyond the fragile epistemic devices with which we fashion judgments and decisions in \nour everyday lives. The inferences provided by the theory are better than other inferences. It is worth \ntaking a moment to consider this, since it is a profound and important assertion.  \n \nIt rests implicitly for its legitimacy in associating itself with the power of other kinds of theory \n(notably the theory of the natural sciences) without providing an account of the provenance of the \nlegitimacy of \u201cgrounded theory\u201d itself. Where, in other words, are the \u201cinference tickets\u201d coming from \nin the supposed process of induction involved in grounded theorizing? This is a crucial issue, given the \nclaims of grounded theory\u2016s proponents.  \n \nAs Ryle notes, natural scientists do have clear methods for establishing these inference tickets: \n\u201cBacteriologists do discover causal connexions between bacteria and diseases \u2026 and so provide \n 14 \nthemselves with inference tickets which enable them to infer from diseases to bacteria\u201d (1990, p. 117). \nBut Ryle goes on to point out that these inference tickets \u2013 pointing to causality and its direction \u2013 \ndepend for their validity on the quality of the associated fact-finding and reasoning. Since Ryle\u2016s death \nan example in just that field makes precisely his case. When the association was noted between the \nbacterium Helicobacter pylori and the presence of ulcers in patients with abdominal complaints, a wide \nrange of additional work had to be undertaken to demonstrate that H. pylori was in fact the cause of \nthe ulcer (see Blaser, 1996). It was perfectly possible, for example, that a weakening of the immune \nsystem brought on by the prior existence of an ulcer (the cause of which was uncertain) merely \nenabled adventitious colonization by H. pylori, rather than the ulcer itself being caused by H. pylori. \nThe direction of causation, in other words, was still in doubt before the undertaking of considerable \nadditional work to establish that direction \u2013 before the finger could be pointed at H. pylori as villain \nrather than merely freeloader. Ryle\u2016s point is that the mere notion of association and the mere notion \nof inference, coupled with a metaphor such as \u201cthe rails of inference\u201d adds almost a third dimension to \nwhat is really a narrative.  \n \nThe association in itself, then, is insubstantial; the \u201cinference ticket\u201d has to be painstakingly enabled by \nthe additional work of a broad research community who replicate, test alternative hypotheses and \nattempt to falsify. Only after these processes are complete do the grand ambitions of induction in \nnatural science \u2013 namely, prediction and explanation \u2013 begin to be realizable. \n \nThe problem, says Ryle, is that functional differences between arguments and narratives are often \nobliterated in our everyday discourse. And here is the problem for grounded theory. Interpretations of \nthe kind made in grounded theory research offer, on their own, no inference tickets \u2013 they enable no \nprediction or explanation, or at least no better prediction or explanation than any of us would make \non the basis of our many years of experience of being human.  \n \nWhat such interpretations offer is merely a narrative. But the point is not to be apologetic about \nnarrative in social analysis. Narrative can be argued to offer more in the way of enlightenment than \nputative theory, while forsaking its epistemic pretensions. By saying it is merely a narrative, we are \nsaying that it is not a narrative and something else: rather, it is a narrative and nothing else. There\u2016s no \nshame to be admitted in this. Nor does one assert that the ideographic constitutes an illegitimate kind \nof knowledge in educational inquiry. The particular and the narrative \u2013 the vignette, the portrait and \nthe story \u2013 are valid and proper ways of doing educational inquiry. The legitimacy of this is at the root \nof Gadamer\u2016s hermeneutics.4  \n \n 15 \nEspecially peculiar and, in our view, objectionable, is the claim that the professional methodologist\u2016s \narmoury contains a set of procedures and techniques (such as \u201csaturation,\u201d and \u201ctheoretical sampling\u201d) \nthat will transform an understanding of narratives or events into some kind of inductive \u201ctheory.\u201d5 As \nEisner reminds us, there is in much scientific and social scientific endeavour the highly problematic \nassumption that procedural objectivity (that is, the attempt to eliminate the scope for judgment) will \nlead us to ontological objectivity (that is, seeing things the way they really are). As he puts it, \n\u201c\u2026 consensus achieved through procedural objectivity provides no purchase on reality. It merely \ndemonstrates that people can agree\u201d (Eisner, 1993, p. 53). In grounded theory, a set of \u201cneutral\u201d \nanalytical procedures replace the \u201cneutral\u201d controls and treatments of the experimental situation in the \nhope that they will provide the same guaranteed route to an uncontaminated correspondence.  \n \nThe mistake in much of the reasoning of those who propose grounded theory is to assume that \nqualitative inquiry can in any way share elements or end-points congruent with those of scientific \ninquiry. Not only is it to assume a continuing need for, to paraphrase Rorty (1979), commensuration \nrather than conversation, it is to import with that assumption all the methodological algorithms \u2013 of \nwhich theory is only one \u2013 of commensuration. It is strange that some social scientists should continue \nto be so attracted by these methodological charms while their \u201cnatural\u201d scientific counterparts have \nbecome more reflective and less self-assured about the benefits of method. As we noted above, many of \nthe latter question what uniquely is gained from induction and the extent to which it is separable from \ndeduction, imagination, inspiration, insight or daydream in enabling shifts forward in what Ziman \n(1991) has uncomplicatedly called Reliable Knowledge. The result has been less arrogant conviction of \nlate about method and more acceptance of the truth of Canguilhem\u2016s (1994, p. 41) assertion that \nscientific advance cannot be defined much more satisfactorily than the \u201celimination of the false by the \ntrue.\u201d  \nTheory, grounded theory and qualitative inquiry \nWhen one argues for the validity of qualitative inquiry one is arguing for a reinstatement of the \nvalidity of interpretation and understanding in a social world \u2013 and all educational worlds are \ninevitably social. That understanding is built out of what we, as people, make of others\u2016 \u2013 teachers\u2016, \nparents\u2016, children\u2016s \u2013 utterances, gestures and actions. They are built, then, out of what Oakeshott \n(1967) called  \nan inheritance of feelings, emotions, images, visions, thoughts, beliefs, ideas, understandings, \nintellectual and practical enterprises, languages, relationships, organizations, canons and \nmaxims of conduct, procedures, rituals, skills, works of art, books, musical compositions, \ntools, artefacts and utensils \u2013 in short, what Dilthey called a geistige Welt. (p. 157) \n \n 16 \nInterpretations are built, in other words, out of what it is to be human. A method will not substitute \nfor the essentials of this humanity; it will not enable one to substitute some formula for divining \nmeaning which is not provided by the inheritance spoken of by Oakeshott. And why should one \nexpect any method to provide such a surrogate? Whence emerged the urge to move beyond everyday \nunderstanding and discover some methodological proxy? The answer lies at least partly in the notion \nof theory in \u201cgrounded theory,\u201d for in the search for such theory one can recognize a familiar melody \nline in social research. It is the search for explanatory phenomena which become accessible via a \nneutral observation language wherein the observer rises above the merely contingent and \ninterpretable. \n \nBrad Sherman (1988), in talking about hermeneutics and the law, suggested that most nominally \nhermeneutic discussion is in fact characterized by a lack of understanding of hermeneutics; it offers \u201can \nunhermeneutical approach to hermeneutics\u201d (p. 395). Our position here, to paraphrase him, is that the \nsearch for grounded theory is characterized by an unqualitative approach to qualitative inquiry. The \nsearch for the kind of theory hankered after by grounded theorists reveals a range of tacit assumptions \nand expectations which disclose grounded theory (and, indeed, many of the techniques of nominally \nqualitative inquiry) to be merely part of another foundationalist enterprise. \n \nFollowers of positivism, so reviled by the new theorists of the social sciences, could at least be said to \nhave established methodological groundrules which were true to positivism\u2016s tenets. Grounded \ntheorists, by contrast, want it both ways. They want the comfortable feeling which comes from a \ndenial of the arrogance of foundationalism and essentialism \u2013 and this is understandable enough. But \nthey want this insignia of intellectual adulthood while clinging on to an epistemological security \nblanket \u2013 one woven from the associated notions that a) some clearer distillation of truth can be \nestablished about the particulars and generalities of social behaviour, and b) that this can be established \nusing the cogs and levers of structured inquiry. Far from the notion that understanding is irreducible, \ntheir project is to step aside from the ineffable and rise above it to emerge with theory. \n \nThe significance of this extends beyond the status and acceptability of grounded theory. It stretches to \nthe nature of educational inquiry itself, and its place in shaping educational discourse and the \neducational enterprise. For grounded theory is merely an example \u2013 it is not an exception to the rule \u2013 \nof a tacitly held desire to respond to those foundationalist impulses. In Derrida\u2016s (1978) terms, the \ndesire for grounded theory represents \u201ca desire for centre in the constitution of structure\u201d (p. 280). But \n\u201cdesire\u201d here is probably too weak a word; this search for some predictive, explanatory theory is more \nlike a need \u2013 one rooted somewhere deep in the recesses of the structuralist history of the social \n 17 \nsciences \u2013 for the security of an epistemic homeland. Perhaps more accurately, then, it is a need to \nmanufacture the machinery for finding that homeland, that \u201ccentre.\u201d It is a need for commensuration \nrather than conversation, for measurement instead of memory, or as Dallmayr (1992: 20) puts it, for \n\u201cstructure\u201d in preference to \u201cevent.\u201d  \n \nThe question that won\u2016t go away in all of this is why grounded theorists (and some other qualitative \ninquirers) want to call their mental constructions \u201ctheory.\u201d For an answer to this question one has to \nreturn to a discussion of the persistent primacy of theory in the knowledge stakes. \n \nHammersley (1992) offers some useful insights on this persistence of theory. Drawing out the \nessentials of qualitative method, he notes that this method is about discovering the social world and \nproducing, supposedly, theoretical descriptions. He notes that this concept of theoretical description is \nproblematic in this context. This is because ethnography places emphasis on description, and \ndescriptions can\u2016t be theories. Descriptions can\u2016t be theories, according to Hammersley, because, \n\u201cDescriptions are about particulars \u2026 whereas theories are about universals\u201d (pp. 12-13). He proceeds \nto unpack some of the features of theoretical activity emerging from ethnographic enterprise but is \nfrank in his failure to resolve the dilemma, concluding that \u201cthe goals of ethnographic analysis need \nrethinking\u201d (p. 28). Further on, Hammersley admits that the \u201cquasi-law-like character of social science \ntheory\u201d (p. 42) creates problems about which he sees no obvious resolution in the context of the \nconstructionist tenets of ethnographic inquiry (see also Hammersley, 1985). \n \nIt is indeed a problem, as we noted above (Why is grounded theory \u201ctheory?\u201d), and it is faced peculiarly \nstarkly by grounded theory, whose protagonists are less self-conscious than Hammersley in their \nallegiance to the methods which in the past have conferred such distinction on positivistic inquiry and \nof which theory is a central element.  \n \nFor Hammersley, the problem requires that the goals of ethnographic analysis are rethought in respect \nof theory. For us, though, the problem is different. It is not with qualitative inquiry\u2016s goals and tenets \n\u2013 there\u2016s nothing at all wrong with these \u2013 but with the search for a particular sort of theory: theory as \nthe end-point of serious inquiry (see Thomas, 2002). The problems stem, in other words, from the \nnotion of theory (in grounded theory or wherever) and what we mean by and expect from theory.  \n 18 \nGround \nWhence \u201cemergence?\u201d Commitment or distance? \n\u2026 one must remember that because emergence is the foundation of our approach to theory \nbuilding, a researcher cannot enter an investigation with a list of preconceived concepts, a \nguiding theoretical framework, or a well thought out design. Concepts and design must be \nallowed to emerge from the data. (Strauss and Corbin, 1998, p. 34, original emphasis) \n \nHow are grounded theorists to quarantine themselves, as social selves, from the data they are analyzing \nand re-analyzing to enable \u201ctheory\u201d to emerge? And how can they transcend this and move outside it \nto stand on neutral \u201cground?\u201d When Strauss and Corbin (1998, p. 99) say \u201cWe know that we never can \nbe completely free of our biases [so we must] \u2026 acknowledge that these influence our thinking and \nthen look for ways in which to break through or move beyond them,\u201d how is this distance, this \n\u201cbeyond,\u201d this \u201cground,\u201d to be achieved? And why should one want to move to some uninflected \nbeyond?  \n \nHow is an interpreter, an ethnographer or grounded theorist to emerge with anything which is not \nmerely reportage if that theorist is not using his or her own person to emerge with the \u201ctheory?\u201d The \nquestion is not really \u201cHow is distance to be found?\u201d but rather \u201cWhat use is distance even if it can be \nfound?\u201d The credibility of much that is at the root of qualitative inquiry is at stake here: the issues \nconcern the legitimacy of the immediate, and the immediately made social construction. Everything in \nsuch inquiry balances on the meanings that we as people read into the social encounters we make in \nlife.  \n \nTo think about these meanings and their relevance for the \u201cmoving beyond\u201d claims of grounded \ntheory, a reverse Schank and Abelson test is helpful. The Schank and Abelson test is one used by the \ncognoscenti of artificial intelligence to determine whether a machine is responding intelligently. A \ncomplex sentence such as \u201cA woman went into a restaurant and ordered a hamburger; when the \nhamburger came she was very pleased with it; and as she left the restaurant she gave the waiter a large \ntip before paying her bill\u201d would baffle a computer which was then posed with the question \u201cDid the \nwoman eat a hamburger?\u201d 6 That is to say, it would baffle the computer unless the machine were to be \nfed a ludicrously long set of instructions incorporating vast amounts of knowledge \u2013 or unless, and this \nis the important bit, the computer had some means of hermeneutically \u201cbracketing\u201d (as Hirsch, 1976, \np. 5, puts it) the information so that it was meaningful. It would baffle the computer unless the \n 19 \ncomputer was, in other words, to all intents and purposes human \u2013 in the sense that it contained all \nthe sense apparatuses, accumulated knowledge and modes of response that make humans human.  \n \nNow consider the test in reverse. Consider human grounded theorists, rather than a computer, being \nasked to take the hamburger question as a Schank and Abelson test. Could they fail it? Or to put the \ncase more starkly, consider the grounded theorist presented with the sentence (perhaps from a \ntranscript): \u201cThe child approached the teacher with her book; the teacher shouted \u2015No!\u2016 and pushed \nthe child outside the door.\u201d Could the grounded theorist, presented with the question \u201cDid the teacher \nact reasonably?\u201d fail to answer the question? Not even with a superhuman feat of energy could \ngrounded theorists detach themselves from their backgrounds, from their own sets of hermeneutic \nbrackets, from all the knowledge, biases and prejudices they have about human behaviour, to deny \ninterpretation and fail to answer the question in one way or another.  \n \nIt should not, of course, be necessary to make this point, since one would assume that it is the position \nof the qualitative researcher: a starting point of such researchers is surely that meaning is constructed \nby the interpreter. The interrelationship between interpreter and interpretation is indissoluble; there is \nno ground, no hidden truth residing somewhere in the data ready to inscribe itself, just as there is no \nLockean tabula rasa in the researcher waiting to be engraved. But \u2013 and it\u2016s a major \u201cbut\u201d \u2013 this is not \nthe starting point of Glaser and Strauss and their successors. For while they say that one should not \nstart a piece of research with preconceived theories, they proceed to say that \u201c\u2026 it is presumptuous to \nassume that one begins to know the relevant categories and hypotheses until the \u2015first days in the \nfield,\u2016 at least, are over\u201d (p. 34). Subsequently, Glaser (in his differences with Strauss) described the \nna\u00efve emptiness with which a researcher should enter the research scene as \u201c\u2026 abstract wonderment\u201d \n(1992, p. 22). \n \nYes, \u201cabstract wonderment\u201d. If the assumption of foreknowledge is taken to be presumptuous, it is \nnothing to the presumptuousness of assuming the empty, directionless, uninflected mind of \u201cabstract \nwonderment.\u201d For the latter \u2013 a mind which will fail any Schank and Abelson test \u2013 is a contradiction \nin terms. Nor is it as presumptuous as: \u201c\u2026 we believe that grounded theory will be more successful \nthan theories logically deduced from a priori assumptions\u201d (Glaser and Strauss, 1975, p. 6). The \nproblem is that a priori assumptions are uneliminable, and this fact \u2013 far from being a source of \nanguish \u2013 is what the qualitative researcher should expect: a priori assumptions are what make study a) \nworthwhile, and b) possible.  \n \n 20 \nThose disgraced \u201ctheories logically deduced from a priori assumptions\u201d are no more or less sinister \nthan the already existing hermeneutic brackets in the researcher\u2016s head \u2013 the stuff of which \ninterpretation is made. These also comprise \u201ca priori assumptions\u201d albeit that someone hasn\u2016t taken \nthe trouble to write them down in order to verify them. For why is the researcher there at all? There \nmust be some assumption that the chosen topic is a worthy field for study. As Gadamer (1975) puts it: \n\u201c\u2026 the meaning exists at the beginning of any \u2026 research as well as at the end: as the choice of the \ntheme to be investigated, the awakening of the desire to investigate, as the gaining of the new \nproblematic\u201d (p. 251). There can be little doubt that some process of verification \u2013 albeit implicit \nrather than explicit \u2013 is going on. This is well illustrated in Alvesson and Sk\u00f6ldberg\u2016s critical discussion \nof the nature of grounded theory. These authors use an extract from one of the most widely-used \nmanuals on grounded theory (that is, Strauss 1987), in which Strauss offers a paragraph of fieldnotes \nfrom observations of nurses working in a cardiac recovery unit, and also gives a detailed introduction \nto the coding process. As Alvesson and Sk\u00f6ldberg show, the example raises fundamental questions \nabout the implicit meaning-making in which the researcher is engaged.  For example, a focus on the \nnurse borrows from one idea in thinking about the division of labour (the degree of autonomy the \nnurse has in relation to specific tasks) yet completely ignores the gender dimensions of the situation.  \nFurthermore, the things the researcher chooses to code produce an account that is highly technicized \nand is stripped of emotions.  Alvesson and Sk\u00f6ldberg note the effect of this, which is that \u201cwe have on \nthe one hand a researcher and a nurse who are conscious but lack emotions, and on the other an \nunconscious patient who possesses strong emotions\u201d (Alvesson and Sk\u00f6ldberg, 2000, p. 26, original \nemphasis).  These authors go so far as to suggest that a kind of \u201crepression\u201d or denial is at work here.  \nWhether or not one agrees, grounded theory procedures begin to look like the neutralization of the \nuncomfortable in the way they can reduce the rich complexity of a situation to relatively safe external \ncausal relationships.   \nGrounded theory and gift-wrapped meaning \nThere is a central problem in the search for grounded theory. It is that there is no untethered spirit \nexisting in the minds of researchers which will enable them neutrally and inertly to lay some cognitive \nframework over the data they collect to allow them to draw \u201ctheory\u201d dispassionately from this data, \nthis ground. These researchers are human beings who walk, talk to friends, tend their gardens, watch \nTV, read books, go to lectures. They have histories of friendships, relationships, of household life of \none kind or another. They understand guile, happiness, sadness, envy, deceit, irony. Their heads are \nfull of notions \u2013 notions about equality, justice, freedom, education, the future, hope, fraternity, \ncharity, feeding the cat and parking the car. These are precisely the things that comprise and give \nstructure to their mental lives. They are what make the drawing of themes from the data possible. \nThey are not things which can be put to one side temporarily for the purpose of discovering grounded \n 21 \ntheory. As Fish (1994) puts it, it is simply \u201czany\u201d to assume that you can \u201cin some way step back from, \nrise above, get to the side of your beliefs and convictions\u201d (p. 295) in such a way that you will be able \nto survey the data unencumbered by the grip of those beliefs and that mental structure. What narcotic \nwill enable the relaxation that will permit this? More importantly, what will be left when the narcotic \nhas worked? For these things are the fabric of mental life and to imagine a mode of being devoid of \nthem is to imagine nothingness. \n \nTo be fair to grounded theorists, they are not unique in their imaginings of epiphany coming ex nihilo. \nSuch imaginings lie also at the root of the seemingly irrepressible search for ever-better method in \nqualitative research. It is a desire to have it both ways, to take on board the fortuitousness and \nuncertainty of a Gadamerian hermeneutics while cleaving to the attractive idea that there is some \ndeterminate and explicable social universe \u2013 some ground \u2013 waiting to be scrolled out. \n \nThe collateral assumption to scrolling out, of course, is that the scrolls, once scrolled out, can be \ndeciphered. The hieroglyphics written on them can be transcribed and painstakingly translated using \nthe tools of grounded theory. Beneath the code is a rich meaning ready for another to understand. The \nconcealed assumptions lurking here in all of grounded theory\u2016s processes and machinery are about \nlanguage acting as a barrier to understanding. It is almost as though language is seen as a kind of inert \nconduit for some real, underlying meaning: the conduit has to be split open for meaning to escape. \nIndeed, the splitting open is made explicit in the word \u201cfractured,\u201d which is used by grounded theorists \u2013 \nfor example by Strauss (1987), who says that \u201ccoding \u2026 fractures the data, thus freeing the researcher \nfrom description and forcing interpretation to higher levels of abstraction\u201d (p. 55). Researchers, with the \ntools of comparative analysis furnished by grounded theory, will break the cipher \u2013 they will be freed \nfrom description and mere narrative to discover the theory. But grounded theorists and other qualitative \nresearchers are surely first and foremost human listeners \u2013 listeners who interpret more or less well on \nthe basis of their experience of being human \u2013 on the quality of their shared knowledge, shared history \nand shared understandings. Listeners should surely be, in Wittgenstein\u2016s words, \u201chaunted by \nexplanations\u201d (Kenny, 1994, p. 221) if they have any sensibility about the frailty of knowledge which an \nunderstanding of qualitative inquiry brings them.  \n \nNone of this is to say that the understanding of others is, as Berlin (1996) puts it, a \u201cspecial act of magical \ndivination not describable in the language of ordinary experience\u201d (p. 24). Rather, it is to recognize that \nour everyday understanding is \u201ca kind of automatic integration of a very large number of data too fugitive \nand various \u2026 Our language is not meant to catch them\u201d (ibid., our emphasis). As anyone who has \nworked with a transcription of someone else\u2016s interview tape would confirm, capturing others\u2016 meaning \n 22 \nwill depend on all kinds of unarticulated and half-articulated signs \u2013 the gaze that is a second too long, the \ngesture, the tone, the intonation, the word used in a special way, the language games. If these \u201cfugitive \ndata\u201d are indeed processed without conscious deliberation, as cognitive science confirms is probable (see, \nfor example, Schooler and Melcher, 1995; Claxton, 1997), how likely are they to be accessible via the \nincomparably clumsier textual weapons of grounded theory? Indeed, in the very notion of \u201cthick \ndescription\u201d and its distinction from \u201cthin description\u201d \u2013 a distinction borrowed from Gilbert Ryle by \nGeertz (1975) \u2013 lies the recognition that such weapons will not be successful in divining meaning. As \nGeertz goes on to point out, in interpreting meanings one cannot be a \u201ccipher clerk\u201d (1975, p. 9). \n \nEven if one could, in other words, \u201cfracture\u201d the data, clean it up, map it to its barest neural components, \none would be no closer to a definitive, transcendent understanding. Even if, as T.S. Eliot (1969) put it in \nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock \u201c\u2026 a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen,\u201d we \nshould still be able to demur from some imposed interpretation. There is, in other words, no \u201cground\u201d \nwhen interpretation is being spoken of. Fish (1989) notes that \u201ccandidates for the status or position of \n\u2015ground\u2016 have included God, the material or \u2015brute act\u2016 world, rationality in general and logic in \nparticular, a neutral-observation language, the set of eternal values, and the free and independent self.\u201d \n(p. 343). The problem with grounded theory is, to paraphrase Fish, that it is implicated in everything \nit claims to transcend. \nDiscovery \nDiscovery \u2013 or invention? \nOne ought to consider the significance of the word discovery in the methods of grounded theory. \nDiscovery is at the heart of these methods, and there has been no dilution in this large claim since the \nearly years of grounded theory. The choice of the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d says much about the epistemic \nproject the authors imagine themselves to be leading, and they lead this project with no trace of false \nmodesty. Indeed, Strauss and Corbin began a recent book (1998) with a long quotation from Galileo, \nwhich they suffixed with the words \u201c\u2026 we, like Galileo, believe that we have an effective method of \ndiscovery\u201d (p. 1). One needs to look in more detail at this claim to discovery, particularly when the \nclaim is made solid, rather than metaphorical, with this remarkable self-comparison.  \n \nDiscovery is a process of uncovering, revealing, disclosing that which is there. The assumption in the \nuse of \u201cdiscovery\u201d is therefore that meaning is laid open for all to see following the application of some \nmethod of finding. Discovery is in no way synonymous with \u201ctentatively suggesting.\u201d The idea that a \n\u201ctheory\u201d can be \u201cdiscovered\u201d therefore puts that theory a long way away from interpretation. In the \nopposition of the interpretative to the normative and the illuminative to the definitive, grounded \n 23 \ntheory \u2013 proudly boasting a pedigree from qualitative inquiry\u2016s stable \u2013 surely aspires to interpretation \nand illumination. The mere use of \u201cdiscovery,\u201d however, divulges expectations closer to the normative \nand the definitive \u2013 to a correspondence view of knowledge.  \n \nThe fact that the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d is used in preference to \u201cinvention\u201d (or \u201cconstruction,\u201d or even \n\u201cgeneration\u201d) is revealing. \u201cDiscovery\u201d involves the disclosure of well hidden but already-existing \nphenomena; it concerns things which exist, albeit that they\u2016re hard to find. By contrast, invention \nrefers to things that exist only in an infinite universe of possibly existing things. Thus, the moons of \nJupiter, the molecular structure of DNA and the tomb of Tutankhamen are discovered. On the other \nhand, the spinning-jenny, diesel engines, iambic pentameters and the telephone are invented.  \n \nWhen the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d is used, the presumption is therefore of the revelation of a solid, \ndisclosable thing \u2013 an entity transcending interpretation. The quite explicit assumption of grounded \ntheorists is that the paraphernalia and machinery of inquiry can reveal this entity with \u201canalytic tools\u201d \n(Strauss and Corbin, 1998, p. 87). Invention, by contrast, is a creative process in which one of myriad \npossible constructions is made out of the stuff \u2013 concrete or mental \u2013 available.  \n \nLet us put \u201cinvention\u201d in the place of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in The Discovery of Grounded Theory so that it \nbecomes The Invention of Grounded Theory. The reason it doesn\u2016t sound quite so impressive is because \n\u201cinvention\u201d (more consistently with the tenets of qualitative inquiry) implies one unique construction \namong a plethora of possible constructions. Inventions are mutable, not static. In fact, inventors are \nsure that their inventions will change and improve: Alexander Graham Bell, one imagines, did not \nassume that his telephone would be the last word in electronic communication. He did not claim to \nhave discovered the telephone. Diffidence must surely be the sine qua non of the inventor. \u201cDiscovery,\u201d \non the other hand, implies little diffidence in one\u2016s ontological assumptions.  \n \nDiscovery implies a clean lineage from thing to thought and an uncomplicated correspondence \nbetween the two. The thought is merely a doppelganger for the thing. But in fact this correspondence \ncan never really exist when it comes to the things of the mind. The historian Simon Schama (1996) \nmakes this point in discussing the discovery of \u201cwild\u201d America: \u201cThe presumption was that the \nwilderness was out there, somewhere, in the western heart of America, awaiting discovery, and that it \nwould be the antidote for the poisons of industrial society\u201d (p. 7). But, of course, that wilderness was a \nfabrication, a dream spun of wishes; it was an invention dressed up as a discovery, or as Schama puts it \n\u201c\u2026 the healing wilderness was as much the product of culture\u2016s craving and culture\u2016s framing as any \n 24 \nother imagined garden\u201d (ibid.). The point is that notions, dreams, even grounded theories, are products \nof cultured minds. Unlike the moons of Jupiter, they are not discovered. \n \nResearchers can, then, be justifiably inductive and analytical about what is assumed unproblematically \nto exist, what is already \u201cthere,\u201d in the way that they cannot be analytical about that which is only \npossibly there and that which changes its shape depending on the knowledge, disposition and dreams \nof the listener or viewer. All the technical procedure and analytic tools of grounded theory therefore \nadmirably fit the bill for \u201cdiscovery\u201d \u2013 but discovery is far from what happens in the process of \ndivining meaning, and this surely ought to be a starting point for the qualitative researcher. \n \nThe choice of the word \u201cdiscovery,\u201d then, reveals much about the way that the proponents of \ngrounded theory think about knowledge. But even more is revealed by the way that they knot \ntogether \u201cdiscovery\u201d with the idea of \u201cground.\u201d Together, \u201cdiscovery\u201d and \u201cground\u201d reveal the notion \nof capturing a truth somewhere out there, which is of course to say, nowhere near the seeker. \nDevelopments in grounded theory: what do they offer? \nSome three decades have passed since the inception of grounded theory and while many continue to \npromote the methods in forms similar to the original (e.g. Strauss and Corbin, 1997, 1998), others, as \nwe noted earlier, have offered significant developments. In these developments, though, as we shall try \nto indicate, there are persisting issues to be resolved. How do the tools of grounded theory, even in \nthese new forms, make what occurs superior to everyday interpretation? How might the looser and \nmore tentative forms of interpretation that go with \u201ccommon interpretive acts\u201d be inhibited or \ndemoted if the methodological proxies of grounded theory persist? What does the continued use of \ngrounded theory say about the legitimacy of qualitative inquiry? And what does a continuing \ninsistence on the procedural signposts of grounded theory encourage people to ignore? \n \nLet us look at a recent use of grounded theory and speculate on how it might have differed from \nanother analysis of the same subject not benefiting from grounded theory. Clarke, an ex-student of \nStrauss (Clarke, 1998), undertakes an excellent analysis of the American reproductive sciences which, \nshe reports, emerges out of grounded theory analysis. She notes, in a general description of grounded \ntheory, that \u201cthe data are coded, and codes are densified and ultimately integrated into an analysis\u201d (p. \n278). However, her very brief description of the method occurs at the end of an appendix in a book of \nover 400 pages. In fact, although a generous attribution to grounded theory is made, it is impossible to \nsee how the detailed analysis \u2013 depending on interviews, documentary data and \u201c\u2015insider\u2016 histories\u2014\u2013\naccounts of events and discoveries, biographies and autobiographies, status reports and so on written \nby reproductive researchers\u201d (p. 277) in any way develops out of the specifics of grounded theory. One \n 25 \nhas to speculate (speculate, since no evidence of the use of codes or densification is offered) how the \ninductive process has differed from, for example, that which occurred in other first-rate analyses which \nhave not employed grounded theory, such as the equally excellent Labeling the Mentally Retarded, \nwritten by Jane Mercer (1973) which likewise used unstructured interviews, community survey and \nofficial records to draw conclusions about the social nature of learning disability.  \n \nIndeed, as Becker (1996) points out, Mercer\u2016s classic about labelling occurred in the context of other \niconic texts which also used a range of methods and analytical strategies. Becker gives as examples \nBlack Metropolis (Drake and Cayton, 1945) and Boys in White (Becker et al, 1961) which drew upon and \nused data of broad provenance \u2013 interview, statistical, observational. These are studies where people \nhave, as Geertz (1995, p. 20) puts it, worked \u201c\u2026 ad hoc and ad interim.\u201d7 \n \nIf one is freed from methodological constraint one is in turn freed to depend more on one\u2016s own \nexperience, more on Dilthey\u2016s geistige Welt \u2013 on all the things of the mind in the world. Those things \nare available to us because we are all members of a species that commonly inhabits and shares the same \nuniverse and the experiences it offers, sharing understandings and sharing meaning-making. Their \navailability comes neither by dint of grounded theory nor any other prescription of method. In fact, \nlooking back on iconic studies and how grounded theory followed (not preceded) them, the point is \nreinforced that much of the original impetus for the formulaic guidance of grounded theory came \nfrom the desire to gain the respect and trust of the \u201cscientific\u201d social scientists in the 1960s \u2013 to be able \nto talk about procedures, reliability, validity and so on. As Robrecht (1995) puts it of Boys in White \n(for which Strauss, incidentally, was one of the research team),  \u201cThe lack of explicit methodological \nprocedures served as a focal point for criticism from the general scientific community \u2026 The challenge \nto those interested in qualitative methods, then, was to provide a more rigorous explanation of these \nmethods\u201d (p. 170). As Sanders (1995, p. 92) put it, the aim seems often to continue to counter positivist \ncritique \u201cthrough more-rigorous-than-thou instructions about how information should be acquired \nand pressed into an analytic mold.\u201d But there should surely be no need any longer to point to proxy \nindicators of a research program\u2016s validity. To want to do this, to want to summon up methods and \ninstruments as if these were the insignia of some higher authority which offered an imprimatur of \nlegitimacy, by implication relegates the more direct understandings and interpretations of qualitative \nresearchers. What is the message being conveyed to the dissertation committees, granting agencies and \ntenure review boards if the shibboleths of positivism and functionalism are so doggedly grasped? \n \nSteps in more helpful directions have been made in the thirty years since The Discovery was published. \nLincoln and Guba (1985, p. 339), for example, draw the constant comparative method from grounded \n 26 \ntheory with enthusiastic recommendations as to its value as a means for processing data, but with \nequally clear warnings as to the hollowness of the putative ends, namely prediction and explanation.  \n \nAs we see it, the mere existence of the term \u201cgrounded theory,\u201d with its key assumptions of \u201cground,\u201d \n\u201ctheory\u201d and \u201cdiscovery\u201d lures any newer forms of qualitative inquiry which cleave to its assumptions \nback into the same problematic territory. Earlier in this article, we briefly described Charmaz\u2016s \nconstructivist grounded theory. But what might be gained by seeking a revised grounded theory of this \nkind? Charmaz says, \u201cIn short, constructing constructivism means seeking meanings\u201d (2000, p. 525) \nbut it is unclear \u2013 in distinguishing this from other forms of seeking meaning \u2013 why this has to be \ncalled \u201cgrounded theory.\u201d She proceeds: \u201cMy version of grounded theory fosters the researcher\u2016s \nviewing the data afresh, again and again\u201d (p. 526). Again, one needs to ask how this differs from the \ninduction or abduction of our everyday sense, how it differs from using the tacit and spoken tools of \nnormal sense-making, or of what Schatzman (1991, p. 304) calls \u201ccommon interpretive acts\u201d \u2013 of \nreview, rehearsal, of talking about it with friends, of employing practical syllogism, recognition, \nevaluation, coming to a conclusion. What Charmaz is doing in her constructivist grounded theory \nsounds very much like the process of hard work and inspiration that combines to enable \ninterpretation and new insights in any field, in the natural or social sciences, in the arts or humanities. \nIt sounds like the need for, as P\u00f3lya (1990) suggests, working with the data and  thinking \u201cuntil you get a \nbright idea\u201d (p. 172).  One wonders what the grounded theoretical ingredients in Charmaz\u2016s new form \nof grounded theory contribute in addition to this. Moreover, one wonders whether they may in fact \ninhibit rather than enable \u201ccommon interpretive acts\u201d as Schatzman (1991) indicates was indeed the \ncase with many of his students who notionally employed grounded theory. \n \nAnd what right does anyone have to proffer a better, a superior rendition based on the benefits \nevidently to be gained by some proxy for direct experience and interpretation? Perhaps because of her \nallegiance to the tenets of grounded theory, Charmaz seems to want in her most recent version to \ncontinue to interpose an additional element in the process of understanding. She does this in rendering \nthrough writing. The constructivist grounded theorist \u201c\u2026 tries to balance theoretical interpretation \nwith an evocative aesthetic\u201d (p. 526).  She says: \u201cI attempt to evoke the experiential feeling through \nhow I render it in writing.\u201d Although this elevation of the process of writing following the use of \ngrounded theory procedures takes research and the reporting of research to a place many miles from \nthe origins of grounded theory, it does nothing to challenge the notion of some expository formula.  \n \nThe simple understanding of being again moves aside for a proxy \u2013 admittedly a self-consciously \nmutable and personal one \u2013 but this proxy is made to stand superior to our other forms of \n 27 \nunderstanding. It is the imposition of an enhanced understanding that is troubling, and it occurs not \njust in grounded theory, not just in ethnography, but throughout the social sciences so willingly \ndrawn upon by educators. Some time ago, Vernon (1964) made the same point about psychologists\u2016 \nmethods and suggested that \u201cthe unsophisticated methods that we ordinarily use in understanding \npeople in daily life\u201d (p. vii) are likely to produce knowledge every bit as accurate and reliable as that \ncoming from psychological tools, however sophisticated. \n \nClearly one needs to write to report one\u2016s findings, but the setting on a pedestal of the artefacts of the \nwritten form as though they provide aids to understanding and interpretation seems to want to take \nthe process one stage too far \u2013 to offer an interpretation of interpretation. (Indeed, in emphasizing the \nprocesses involved in writing is the potential to magnify differences between observer and observed \u2013 a \ntheme of much discourse on writing from Rousseau to Derrida, and well discussed by Norris, 1987, p. \n97.) What Charmaz seems to be arguing for is a rediscovery of the symbolic interactionism that \ngrounded theory sought to transcend.  In so doing, she endorses a wholly appropriate and \ninterpretivist form of constructivism. What is puzzling is her apparent need to tether this to grounded \ntheory as a methodological label. While Charmaz\u2016s form of constructivist grounded theory moves \ngrounded theory far from its inception point in the ideas of Glaser and Strauss, it still \u2013 in wanting to \ncall itself grounded theory \u2013 adheres to grounded theory\u2016s core principles. That is to say it adheres to \nthe notion of \u201cground\u201d (the idea there is something beyond and underpinning) and the notion of  \n\u201ctheory,\u201d that one can perform some supervening process which will interpret interpretation. \nConcluding comment \u2013 grounded theory misses the best \nIn formulating grounded theory procedures, Glaser and Strauss performed an invaluable task in \nbringing to general notice the powerful deliberations of the Chicago School: of argument about the \nvalidity of ethnographic, phenomenological, interpretative, hermeneutic \u2013 in other words, qualitative \n\u2013 inquiry. More than this, to those who called \u201cWhere is your epistemic collateral? Where is your \ntheory?\u201d they provided difficult-to-refute answers. They made a major contribution to making \nqualitative inquiry legitimate. \n \nBut all of that debate and proselytization was a product of its time. Our argument is that the success of \ngrounded theory \u2013 its success in helping to validate qualitative inquiry \u2013 depended on something of a \nsleight of hand in reasoning about inquiry. Hindsight enables one to see the debate of the time in \ncontext, and to move on. The argument for qualitative research now stands in its own right. \nContinued allegiance to grounded theory procedures \u2013 or, strangely, loyalty simply to the term \n\u201cgrounded theory,\u201d unstitched from its procedures or putative ends \u2013 stunts and distorts the growth of \nqualitative inquiry. \n 28 \n \nThere is no need continually to reinvent grounded theory. Our argument throughout this article has \nbeen that the starting points of qualitative inquiry are contradicted \u2013 and even undermined \u2013 by the \naims, claims and methods of grounded theorists. But the most important practical issue, particularly \nfor educators and educational researchers, is neither whether the algorithms of grounded theory are \njustified, nor whether they enable the induction, explanation and prediction that Glaser and Strauss \n(and others more recently) have claimed for them. The most important issue is rather about what is \nmissed or dismissed if one continues to use grounded theory, and continues thereby to promote the \nepistemological and theoretical precepts embodied in its name. \n \nTo use grounded theory involves a rejection of simple understanding. It entails an explicit denial of \nwhat we know and our ways, as practitioners (and as human beings), of making sense. For grounded \ntheory elevates a certain kind of thinking while it demotes and eschews other kinds of thinking and \nunderstanding. In its hankering after order \u2013 with its fracturing, its axial coding, its categories and sub-\ncategories \u2013 it seeks to impose a certain kind of patterning, shape, and even rationality. Via such \nprocedures it thereby relegates the original voice \u2013 the narrative \u2013 of both the respondent and the \ndiscussant in the research exercise. By the superimposition of method, and the ultimate production, \nsupposedly, of theory, it implies a dismissal of the direct validity and import of people\u2016s accounts, such \nas those children who fail to adapt to the school system or fail to learn in that system. Earlier in this \narticle we gave reasons for qualitative inquiry in the tenets of hermeneutics, but it should be \nremembered that another reason for favouring qualitative method lies in the foregrounding of \ndifferent voices and the displacement of what Lyotard called \u201cprivileged speech communities\u201d (see \nHaber, 1994, for a readable account of Lyotard\u2016s views). One should hear the narrative of those who \nhave been taken to be, according to Foucault (1980), \u201cnaive \u2026 low-ranking\u201d (p. 82). But the \nimplication accompanying grounded theorizing is that the knowledge of these others has in some way \nto be sanitized for it to become transparent to rational people. The narrative has to be broken, \n\u201cfractured,\u201d for sense to prevail. \n \nNot only this, but grounded theory with its procedural machinery, also relegates the clear accounts of \nresearchers themselves: students, teachers or other professionals. Although there is a new kind of \nconstructivist grounded theory it is unclear what this can add to such accounts; indeed, it may even \nsubtract from them, as users focus on method rather than voice. Examples of such clear narrative can \nbe found in James Patrick\u2016s (1973) classic A Glasgow Gang Observed, or in the \u201cfictional\u201d narrative of \nclassroom life given by Sconiers and Rosiek (2000). Here, narrative is told simply and clearly with no \n 29 \npretence that by some methodological alchemy it will be transformed to something more secure in its \nepistemic status. \n \nAs Becker (1996, p. 70) asserts, there are no recipes for ways of doing social research; rather, one has to \nhave \u201cimagination and \u2026 smell a good problem and find a good way to study it.\u201d This sounds rather \nlike Feyerabend\u2016s \u201canarchism, while perhaps not the most attractive political philosophy, is certainly \nexcellent medicine for epistemology\u201d (1993, p. 9, original emphasis). \n  \nIn none of the looser approaches just noted will be found the sort of elevation of a methodological \nprescription that one finds in grounded theory.  More typical is an insistence that knowledge is \neverywhere, that all such knowledge is valid and that we should feel unconstrained it its collection, use \nand analysis. A preoccupation with method (and not just in grounded theory) makes for mirages of \nsome kind of reliable knowing, and this in the end makes us almost more concerned with the method \nthan the message. As Andreski (1972) suggests, \u201cThe overemphasis on methodology and techniques, as \nwell as adulation of formulae and scientific-sounding terms, exemplify the common tendency \u2026 to \ndisplace value from the end to the means\u201d (pp. 108-9). \n \nNew researchers in education are likely to find the procedural rules of grounded theory attractive: the \napproach has an apparent resonance with particular folk models of scientific endeavour, and appears to \nproffer a map and a compass to navigate the open terrain of qualitative inquiry. Everyone, after all, \nlikes to know the \u201cright\u201d way and the offer of such aids will surely be appealing. But if researchers do \npick up and run with grounded theory, they risk losing the best of qualitative inquiry.  \n \nThe authors would like to express their thanks to Martyn Hammersley for his comments on an earlier \ndraft of this paper. \nReferences \nAlthusser, L.

These range over \na vista of topics from the study of costs and benefits associated with participation in adult basic education programs \n(Mezirow, Darkenwald, & Knox, 1975), to academic change (Conrad, 1978), to middle school students\u201f perceptions \nof factors helping the learning of science (Spector & Gibson, 1991), to reference group socialization of secondary \nschool teachers (Gehrke, 1981), to teachers\u201f perspectives on effective school leadership (Blase, 1987). Many more \nare identified by Babchuk. Clearly, grounded theory is viewed as a most accessible and appropriate \u2013 perhaps the \nmost accessible and appropriate \u2013 way of doing qualitative research in education. \n3\n Protoscientific theory emerges out of \u201c\u2026 private and social experiences [and] human beings construct a set of \ngeneralisations, held together by seemingly theoretical postulates (such as \u201ean intention\u201f and \u201ea belief\u201f) and inferences \n(\u201epractical syllogisms\u201f), and \u2026 this has a kind of protoscientific structure\u201d (Russell, 1992, p. 486.). The need for the \ndistinction between this and other kinds of knowledge goes back a long way: Plato distinguished between eikos  \u2013 \nwhat is likely, probable, reasonable \u2013 epag\u00f4g\u00ea induction, and episteme, meaning knowledge. \n4\n As Gadamer (1975) notes, in arguing for the legitimacy of experience, the dignity of science depends on the \n\u201cfundamental repeatability\u201d (p. 311) of experience. In answering Bacon\u201fs opposition to \u201cempty dialectical casuistry\u201d \n(p. 313), he suggests that in studies of what it is to be human \u2013 in the \u201chuman sciences\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe only scientific thing is \nto recognise what is\u201d (p. 466, original emphasis). No method can help us achieve this recognition. \n5\n Glaser, in his dispute with Strauss, is able to state that grounded theorising needs a series of steps \u201c\u2026 none of which \ncan be skipped if the analyst wishes to generate a quality theory\u201d (1978, p. 16). \n6\n This is a paraphrase of the use of the Schank and Abelson test used by John Searle (1982). \n7\n In more recent, but related, work \u2013 looking at the overrepresentation of students of certain ethnicities in special \neducation programmes \u2013 it is difficult to see the benefits of the grounded theoretical analysis of Harry et al (2005) \nover the non-grounded analysis of, say, Tomlinson (1982) or Benjamin (2003). \n"}
