Although not a member of \nthe limus family, the paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) \n(Taxus\u00ae, Boston Scientific) was the second DES to re-\nceive FDA approval, one year after the SES. Paclitaxel \nstabilises microtubules and thereby inhibits cell divi-\nsion in the G0\/G1 and G2\/M phases. \nThe randomised TAXUS-I trial (2003) was designed \nas a First in Man (FIM) phase I feasibility study and \nproved that a polymer-coated PES was superior to \nBMS at six and 12 months of follow-up (10). Thereaf-\nter, the TAXUS family trials expanded with the II, IV, \nV, and VI trials and confirmed the superiority of PES \nas compared with BMS in more complex patients \nand lesions (11-14). \nIn the TYPHOON trial (15), the use of SES vs. BMS \nresulted in significant reduction in combined Ma-\njor Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) (5.9% vs.14.6%, \np<0.001) and target-lesion revascularisation (TLR) \n(3.7% vs.12.6%, p<0.0001).

While these \nfirst-generation DES are a major step forward in that they halve the \nneed for repeat revascularisation without an increase in death or \nmyocardial infarction, there is an increased risk of LST, which is of \nparticular concern, especially after discontinuation of dual anti-\nplatelet therapy (17). \nPooled clinical trials of SES and PES versus their BMS counterparts \nhave shown no differences for death, MI or stent thrombosis dur-\ning four years of follow-up. Both stents, however, were observed \nto have slightly more frequent ST events in the period beyond the \nfirst year; this is termed very late stent thrombosis (18) (Mauri et al, \n2007). These differences were not statistically different but were \ndetermined to be potentially clinically meaningful and resulted in \na recommendation by a special FDA advisory panel to extend dual \nantiplatelet therapy for a minimum of 12 months if there are no \nbleeding contraindications. Randomised trials comparing SES ver-\nsus PES have generally not demonstrated any differences in death, \nMI or stent thrombosis. In the meta-analysis above, however, there \nwas slightly increased risk of stent thrombosis for PES (HR, 0.66; \n95% CI, 0.46-0.94; p = .02), with the difference beginning after six \nmonths. This effect was driven mostly by a single study and should \nbe interpreted with the appropriate caution.\nIt is generally accepted that DES are associated with an increased \nincidence of LST compared to BMS (19), this excess risk appears to \nbe small and not to translate into adverse clinical outcome. How-\never, until now this has remained a concern, particularly in ACS pa-\ntients. There are plausible biological mechanisms to support these \nconcerns, including delayed endothelialisation, enhanced agonist-\ninduced platelet aggregation, and hypersensitivity reaction to the \npolymer. In addition, there are theoretical concerns that stent de-\nployment in the context of a pro-thrombotic, inflammatory state \nmay compromise vessel healing and re-endothelialisation; and \nhence could increase the risk of LST, concerns supported by recent-\nly published histological data (20). The extent of thrombus burden \nat the time of stent implantation might also be a significant factor \nin the incidence of LST. Sianos et al (21) demonstrated a two-year \nrate of LST of 8.2% in patients with large thrombus burden vs. a rate \nof only 1.3% for those with a small thrombus burden.\nRecently long-term results from two studies comparing DES with \nBMS in patients with STEMI have raised some questions about the \nlong-term risks of DES. In one study known as PASSION trial, con-\nducted in two centres between 2003 and 2004, the researchers \nenrolled 619 patients with STEMI and followed them for up to five \nyears. All patients were treated with 75mg of clopidogrel daily for at \nleast six months and 80 to 100mg aspirin indefinitely. At five years, \nthe composite end point of cardiac death, recurrent MI and TLR was \n22.0% in the BMS arm and 18.3% in the DES arm, a non-significant \ndifference. Unlike the DEDICATION study, there was no statistically \nsignificant difference in the rates of cardiac death-11.5% in the BMS \nand 8.9% in the DES arms. Rates of TLR at five years were 10.5% and \n7.3% in the BMS and DES arms, respectively. \nThere was a trend toward increased rates of definite stent thrombo-\nsis among those treated with the PES. At five years, ST was double \nthat of the BMS treated patients, although this increased risk was \nnot statistically significant. The increased risk appeared between \nyears one and five of follow-up, according to investigators. In the \nDEDICATION trial, investigators report an increased risk of cardiac \ndeath at three years in patients treated with a DES compared with \npatients treated with a BMS.\nThe DEDICATION trial randomised 626 STEMI patients either to a \nBMS or a DES. Eight-month follow-up results hinted at an increased \nrisk of cardiac mortality. During follow-up at three years, this risk \nwas maintained, with a 6.1% cardiac death rate in those treated \nwith the DES and a 1.9% cardiac death rate in the BMS arm. Ma-\njor adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which included cardiac \ndeath, re-infarction and TLR, were significantly lower in the DES \narm, a result that was driven by a reduction in TLR.\nSecond-generation Stents\nFirst-generation DES were considered to be essentially BMS that \nhave been sprayed with polymer and drug. In the first generation \nof DES (Taxus and Cypher), 316L stainless steel was used as the \nplatform and the strut thickness ranged from 130 to 140\u03bcm. In fact, \nthe second generation of DES (Endeavor with zotarolimus eluting \nstent-ZES and Xience V with Everolimus eluting stents-EES) are con-\nstructed from cobalt-chromium and have thinner stent struts (80-\n90\u03bcm) that result in a decrease in neointimal response and more \nrapid re-endothelialisation. \nThis design improves flexibility and stent delivery and may be as-\nsociated with reduced vessel injury. Preclinical data have demon-\nstrated that stents with thinner struts have a greater degree of re-\nendothelialisation compared to those with thicker struts (22). \nZES is marketed as Endeavor (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA) platform \nis composed of a cobalt alloy stent, a Phosphorylcholine (PC) poly-\nmer and zotarolimus (ABT-578), a drug designed to inhibit smooth \nmuscle cell proliferation (23). The drug layer of the ZES is 90 percent \nzotarolimus and 10 percent PC; with full drug elution, this layer dis-\nappears, leaving behind only a 1-micron PC base coat. EES is mar-\nketed as both XIENCE V (Abbott Vascular Devices, Redwood City, \nCA) and Promus (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA). \nIt is a thin-strut cobalt-chromium stent coated with a thin durable \nfluoropolymer that elutes everolimus, an analogue of sirolimus, \nwith an elution profile similar to that of SES. The layer of everoli-\nmus-polymer matrix with a thickness of 5\u20136 microns is applied to \nthe surface of the stent and is loaded with 100 \u03bcg of everolimus per \ncm2 of stent surface area with no top coat polymer layer. Of inter-\nest, coating thickness appears less for the Xience V (5.3 microns) \nthan for Cypher (7.2 microns) or Taxus (15.6 microns).\nData from a series of large RCTs  have demonstrated that not only \nis the ZES effective in preventing restenosis, with low rates of TLR, \nbut also the incidence of late and very LST is extremely low; indeed \nin contrast to SES and PES, LST was no higher than with the com-\nparator BMS (24-26).  The safety and efficacy of the Endeavor\u2122 ZES \nplatform has been established in stable de novo coronary artery le-\nsions. The Endeavor I study (24) included 100 patients with a single \ncoronary lesion and showed MACE rate of 2% at 12 months. \nThe Endeavor II study (25) in 1,197 patients with single de novo cor-\nonary artery lesion, demonstrated low MACE (7.3%), low TLR (4.6%) \nand stent thrombosis rate of 0.5%, maintained out to two years fol-\nlow-up. The Endeavor III study (26) comparing ZES with SES in 436 \npatients, showed no cases of stent thrombosis after nine months \nfollow-up. Results from these studies provided evidence that the \nZES platform was safe and efficacious, and because of the exceed-\ningly low reported rate of stent thrombosis with the ZES platform it \nwas suggested that there may be a theoretical advantage of using \nZES in acute, high-risk PCI such as STEMI.\n22 EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE        VOL I  ISSUE II\nHEALTHCARE BULLETIN       |       INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY\nRecently, the 18 months results from SORTOUT III trial (Danish Or-\nganization for Randomized Trials with Clinical Outcomes) which \nrepresents real world experience, favoured the SES above the ZES. \nResults of the trial were presented in Atlanta at the American Col-\nlege of Cardiology (ACC) meeting 2010 and have recently been \npublished in The Lancet (27).  Out of 2332 patients, 1162 patients \n(1619 lesions) were assigned to receive the ZES, and 1170 patients \n(1611 lesions) to receive the SES. Within nine months, MACE oc-\ncurred more often in ZES patients than in SES patients (6% vs 3%, \nHR 2\u202215, 95% CI 1\u202243\u20133\u202223; p=0\u20220002). \nThis difference was maintained at 18 months (9.7% vs. 4.5%, respec-\ntively). Although there was no difference in all cause-mortality at \nnine months, at 18 months there was a significant advantage for \nSES (4% vs 3%; 1\u202261, 1\u202203\u20132\u202250; p=0\u2022035). The results of SORT OUT \nIII differ from the results observed in the Endeavor clinical trial pro-\ngram. SORT OUT III study differed in that it included patients with \ncomplex lesions, such as bifurcations, ostial lesions, left main le-\nsions, long lesions and chronic total occlusions, as well as patients \nwith ACS and STEMI, and that it was powered to address clinical \nend points.\nThe Clinical Evaluation of the Xience V (EES) Stent System in the \nTreatment of Patients with de novo Native Coronary Artery Lesions \nFirst (SPIRIT) trial proved the superiority of everolimus embedded \nin a durable polymer on a cobalt chromium stent as compared with \nBMS (multi-Link Vision). Neither SPIRIT II nor III trial was powered \nfor superiority for clinical end points, and the routine performance \nof angiographic follow-up may have artificially exaggerated the \nabsolute benefits of Xience V stent. Therefore, SPIRIT IV trial was \ndesigned (28) without angiographic follow-up to further assess the \ndifferences between these two stent platforms.  \nSPIRIT IV had randomised 3690 patients to receive the Xience V or \nthe PES Express 2 stent. Three years data was presented at the TCT \nmeeting 2009 which revealed 43% and 39% reduction in MACE and \nTLR, respectively, in comparison to PES. No stent thromboses oc-\ncurred in either stent between two and three years, and there were \nno differences in overall rates of stent thrombosis between the two \nstents (0.9% vs 1.6%, p=0.37). Whereas in 3690 patients, SPIRIT IV \ntrial (also presented at TCT meeting 2009) found a statistically sig-\nnificant difference in stent thrombosis between the two arms at \none year: 0.29% for Xience V vs. 1.06% for Taxus (p=0.003). \nWith results that back up those of SPIRIT IV, a second trial in real-life \npractice comparing Xience V with PES called COMPARE randomised \n1800 consecutive patients to blinded treatment undergoing elec-\ntive or emergency PCI. The primary endpoint was a composite of \nall-cause mortality, non-fatal MI and TLR within 12 months. Follow-\nup was completed in 1797 patients and on the intention to treat \nanalysis, the primary endpoint occurred in 56 (6%) of 897 patients \nin the Xience V group versus 82 (9%) of 903 in the PES group (rela-\ntive risk [RR] 0.69; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95, p = 0.02 for superiority).\nOne year follow-up showed that in addition to the 31% relative risk \nreduction (p=0.02) for that composite end point in patients treated \nwith the Xience V in the trial, the EES was associated with signifi-\ncantly less ST (p=0.002) (29). This represents some very important \nprogress with second-generation stents, as not only efficacy but \nalso safety has improved, namely by a significant reduction in MI as \nwell as stent thrombosis through one year.\nNext generation stents\nIn addition to the improvements that have been made in second-\ngeneration DES, there are currently newer approaches being tested \nsuch as biodegradable polymers and stents, polymer free drug \ndelivery and the prohealing approach. Prohealing technology, \ndesigned to enhance re-endothelialisation, is used in the Genous \nstent (coated with anti-CD34 antibody).  Two year follow-up data \nfrom the single centre TRIAS-HR study, presented at the Euro-PCR \nmeeting 2009, showed similar mortality (5.1% vs. 4.2% and TLR \nrates (15.3% vs. 13.7%) for the Genous stent versus PES.  However, \nthe thrombosis rates in PES were 5.3% vs. 0.0% in Genous stent arm.\nThe ABSORB is one of the recent clinical trials that has looked at \nthe benefits of using bio-absorbable stents. The ABSORB trial was \na prospective, multicentre, open-label, first-in-man study that as-\nsessed the bioabsorbable polymer drug-eluting stent (BVS) tested \noriginally in just 30 patients with single, de novo lesions in 3.0-mm \nvessels (30). Two years imaging results {IVUS, multislice-CT, optical \ncoherence tomography} has been published recently indicating \nthat at least one-third of the stent has been absorbed by the vessel \nwall (31). Three years data from ABSORB 1st phase clinical trial was \nrecently presented at AHA scientific sessions which showed no case \nof stent thrombosis out to three years and no new MACE between \nsix months and three years (3.6% at 3 years). \nCONCLUSION \nSoon after their commercial launch, DES have demonstrated dra-\nmatic reductions in the requirement for repeat revascularisation of \nthe stented segment (TLR) compared with BMS or balloon angio-\nplasty. The first-generation devices, SES (Cypher) and PES (Taxus) \nappear to have an ongoing risk for ST beyond one year after stent-\ning that may be related to inflammatory effects of the drug itself, \ndrug dose or release kinetics or late effects of the polymer. How-\never, alarming reports on potential increases in death, early and \nlate stent thrombosis which mandate prolonged dual anti-platelet \ntherapy, led to a decrease in use and stimulated the development \nof second-generation DES- EES (Xience V or Promus) and ZES (En-\ndeavor).\nThey differ mainly in polymer technology and metallic stent struc-\nture. Until recently, they were proving to be significantly more ef-\nfective and safer compared to the first-generation DES to reduce \nrisk of ST in ACS patients with better stent design, greater biocom-\npatibility with release kinetics.  However, the most recent break \nthrough SORT OUT III trial which represents real-world experience, \nshowed increase risk of ST with ZES well as there is increased risks \nof MACE and TLR in ZES compared to SES without any difference in \nall cause mortality.  However, larger randomised and longer term \ncontrolled studies are needed in patients with ACS and real world \nsituations of patients with long lesions, calcification or bifurcations \nto assess their safety, especially in respect of very LST and the re-\nquirement of prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy. \n23\nDRUG-ELUTING STENTS IN ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME\nEUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE        VOL I  ISSUE II\nStone GW, Ellis SG, Cox DA, Hermiller J, O\u2019Shaughnessy C, Mann JT, \nTurco M, Caputo R, Bergin P, Greenberg J, Popma JJ, Russell ME.
