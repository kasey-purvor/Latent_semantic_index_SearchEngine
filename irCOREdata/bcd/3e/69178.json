Introduction\n[2] During intense magnetic storms, observations [e.g.,\nTsyganenko et al., 2003] show deep magnetic field depres-\nsions even very close to Earth (L \u0001 3\u20134). Since the dipole\nfield is used extensively in storm modeling, it is important\nto quantify the degree to which it is inadequate (i.e., the\nimportance of the ring current in changing the field) during\nsuch events. One way to do this is by empirical modeling \u2014\nwhich is not always the right solution, especially for\napplications in which equilibrium between field and plasma\nis required [Zaharia and Cheng, 2003b]. Another way is\ncomputing magnetospheric structures in which the field is\nforce balanced with the plasma pressure.\n[3] Two numerical 3-D equilibrium approaches exist that\ninclude the near-Earth region: a \u2018\u2018magnetofriction\u2019\u2019 MHD\napproach [Hesse and Birn, 1993; Toffoletto et al., 2001]\nand an iterative solution in flux coordinates (Euler poten-\ntials) that uses prescribed pressure at one point on the field\nlines [Cheng, 1995; Zaharia and Cheng, 2003a; Zaharia et\nal., 2004]. While both techniques have been successfully\napplied to isotropic pressure cases, the former has not been\nextended to anisotropic pressure. Since near-Earth plasma\npressure is anisotropic (P? > Pk) during both quiet and\nactive times [e.g., De Michelis et al., 1999], the latter\napproach is currently the only available tool of finding 3-D\nequilibria with anisotropic pressure.\n[4] Previous studies with this approach [Zaharia et al.,\n2004] have used statistical pressure\/degree of anisotropy\nobservations [Lui et al., 1994; De Michelis et al., 1999].\n[5] Here we compute a sequence of near-Earth equilibria\non shorter time scales, during a magnetic storm, with input\npressure from a kinetic model at one-hour intervals. While\nthe pressure employed is perhaps not entirely realistic, being\nobtained by using a dipolar field (and thus we cannot claim\nthat the obtained configurations will accurately reproduce\nobservations), the study will give an indication of how\nstrongly the field gets deformed by the plasma pressure,\nand thus of how good the dipolar approximation is in the\nnear-Earth magnetosphere during storms.\n[6] The study considers the intense (Dst <\u0004150 nT) storm\nof October 21\u201325, 2001, which was simulated using the\nUNH-RAM model, a kinetic ring current model analyzing\nthe bounce-averaged motion in a dipolar B-field, including\nFigure 1.

The model takes initial conditions from POLAR\/\nMICS data and boundary conditions from LANL\/MPA and\nSOPA data. In Figure 1 we show the measured\/modeled Dst\nfor this storm (the RAM model uses Kp-dependent Volland-\nStern convection for all results here, with the coefficient\nA(Kp) presented by Jordanova et al. [1998, Figure 4]).\n[7] Our results show the force-balanced B-field to be\nsignificantly depressed compared to the dipole field during\nthis storm. We find that plasma b (the ratio of plasma to\nmagnetic pressure) can be very large (\u000110) even as close as\n5 RE from Earth, requiring strong field-line stretching to\naccommodate force balance. The results demonstrate the\nneed for improving the magnetic fields used in storm-time\nkinetic modeling, ideally by feeding the kinetic models\nfields computed to be in force balance with the plasma\ndistribution. While not yet fully self-consistent in that the\nequilibrium field is not returned to the kinetic simulation to\nguide its continued evolution, the work here also represents\na first step toward adding that self-consistency to a global\nkinetic ring current model.\n2. Model\n[8] The equilibrium with anisotropic pressure is an exten-\nsion [Zaharia, 2003] of the isotropic case [Cheng, 1995;\nZaharia et al., 2004]. The 3-D force balance equation is\ndecomposed (by expressing B in terms of Euler potentials as\nB =\n#\ny\u0005 #a) into two \u2018\u2018quasi-2D\u2019\u2019 elliptic PDEs for y and\na, which are (in the rationalized EMU system):\n#\u0006 #y\u00f0 \u00de2 #a\u0004 #a \u0006 #y\u00f0 \u00de #y\nh i\n\u00bc \u0004 B\u0005\n#\ny\u00f0 \u00de\nsB2\n\u0006 #P? \u00fe 1\u0004 s\u00f0 \u00de #B\n2\n2\n\u0003 \u0004\u0005 \u0006\n\u00f01\u00de\n#\u0006 #a \u0006 #y\u00f0 \u00de #a\u0004 #a\u00f0 \u00de2 #y\nh i\n\u00bc \u0004 B\u0005\n#\na\u00f0 \u00de\nsB2\n\u0006 #P? \u00fe 1\u0004 s\u00f0 \u00de #B\n2\n2\n\u0003 \u0004\u0005 \u0006\n; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere s = 1 + (P? \u0004 Pk)\/B2 (note: the Euler potentials y and\na are usually referred to as a and b, respectively, in the space\nphysics community). The equations are solved iteratively,\nwith the non-linear right hand side terms kept fixed at each\niteration. For a unique solution, one needs the pressures P?\nand Pk at one point on each field line, as well as boundary\nconditions (BCs) for the magnetic flux y, together with the\nshapes of the inner\/outer flux surfaces (the BC for a is\nperiodicity). The BCs in the third coordinate c (along the\nfield lines) is simply that they and a potentials at each end of\nthe line (i.e. on the Earth surface) are those of a dipole, which\nare analytically known.\n[9] The boundary shapes for y are usually obtained by\nfield-line tracing using empirical models [Zaharia et al.,\n2004]. Here we use the T89 model (chosen mainly because\nthe RAM model uses Kp-dependent convection), parame-\nterized by the nearest integer corresponding to the observed\nKp at each hour of the storm. We thus build 6 computational\ndomains (with Kp from 1 to 6), covering different times\nthroughout the storm. Although the T89 field is also taken\nas an initial \u2018\u2018guess,\u2019\u2019 the computed field will be different\nfrom it everywhere: while inside the domain the field lines\n\u2018\u2018move\u2019\u2019 with three degrees of freedom as they approach\nequilibrium, on the boundaries they still retain two degrees\nof freedom \u2014 they can slide on the boundaries to accom-\nmodate the pressure gradients).\n[10] The pressure input consists of equatorial P? and Pk\nwhich are moments of the distribution function from the\nkinetic model. Only the ion (H+, O+ and He+) pressure is\nFigure 2. Equatorial profiles of P? (nPa) inside circular sectors of radii 2 RE and 6.5 RE at four hours during the storm.\nFigure 3. Equatorial profiles of B \u0004 Bdip (top) and B \u0004 BT89 (bottom) (B is the computed field) at four different times.\nL03102 ZAHARIA ET AL.: STORM-TIME MAGNETIC FIELD L03102\n2 of 4\nconsidered, with the electron pressure neglected. While for\nthe isotropic case the pressure can simply be \u2018\u2018mapped\u2019\u2019\nalong the field lines as in equilibrium it is constant along\nthem, this is not so for anisotropy. However, for bi-\nMaxwellian pressure in a collisionless plasma we can use\nenergy and magnetic moment conservation to find the\npressure along the field lines at each iteration [e.g., Spence\net al., 1987; Zaharia, 2003]. We note that the pressure\nprofile is kept spatially fixed in the equatorial plane, and\ntherefore P?(y, a, c) and Pk(y, a, c) change at each\niteration until equilibrium is achieved. Thus the obtained\n3-D equilibria also provide a mapping of the equatorial P?\nand Pk into the whole domain.\n[11] Pressure data were available from the RAM model\nfor 120 hours, starting at 00:00 UT on October 21, 2001,\nand one equilibrium \u2018\u2018snapshot\u2019\u2019 was computed for each\nhour (we only present results at four of those hours here).\nThe equatorial P?, shown at these times in Figure 2, greatly\nincreases at the peak of the storm, reaching more than\n90 nPa in the dusk sector at 4 RE. Before the storm, as well\nas in the recovery phase, the pressure is nowhere larger\nthan 12 nPa. The degree of anisotropy P?\/Pk (not shown)\nis large close to Earth at the peak of the storm and in the\nrecovery phase (when it exceeds 5).\n3. Results\n[12] Unlike our previous study which extended to 23 RE\nfrom Earth [Zaharia et al., 2004], the computations here are\nfrom 2 RE to 6.5 RE only. Each equilibrium snapshot is\ncomputed in one of six domains, built using T89 with Kp the\nnearest integer corresponding to the measured Kp. While all\nsix domains extend to 6.5 RE at midnight, they are more or\nless compressed at other longitudes, due to the different\nmagnetic flux compression at different Kp.\n[13] Figure 3 shows equatorial plane profiles of the\ndifference between the computed and the dipolar and T89\nmagnetic fields, respectively: B \u0004 Bdip and B \u0004 BT89. It is\nclear that the computed field is much lower than dipolar.\nThe minimum B \u0004Bdip (\u0004170 nT) is attained at T = 24 hr, at\n4 RE from Earth in the nightside. The T89 field is itself\ndifferent from dipolar, but the bottom plots show that the\ncomputed field is also different from the T89 field, with the\nlargest difference again at the peak of the storm, when\nthe field inside the domain exhibits the largest depression\n(\u0004100 nT) compared to the T89 field.\n[14] Figure 4 shows plasma b? in the equatorial plane.\nWhile b? is low (generally <1) before the storm\/in the\nrecovery phase, it greatly increases at its peak, reaching a\nvalue of about 10 on the night side. This explains why the\nfield is so changed from a dipole, as when b > 1 the pressure\nis crucial in determining the magnetic configuration.\n[15] Figure 5 shows the azimuthal current density Jf in the\nequatorial and noon-midnight meridian planes. One clearly\nsees two current systems, one eastward at \u00013 RE, the other\nwestward at 4\u20136 RE, in agreement with observations [e.g.,\nLe et al., 2004]. The largest currents (\u000120 nA\/m2) are at\ndusk, in locations of high pressure. They are largest at the\nstorm peak, with Jfmax more than an order of magnitude\nlarger than before the storm. An interesting feature in the\nnoon-midnight meridian plots is that at the storm peak,\ninstead of having maximum in the equatorial plane, the\nwestward current on the nightside has a \u2018\u2018butterfly\u2019\u2019 shape,\nwith maxima above and below the plane. This is due to\nthe pressure anisotropy: a current in an equilibrium with\nanisotropic pressure is lower where b? is higher [Hoffman\nFigure 4. Plasma b? on the equatorial plane at the four chosen times throughout the storm.\nFigure 5. Azimuthal current density Jf (nA\/m\n2) in the (top) equatorial and (bottom) noon-midnight meridian planes.\nPositive (negative) signs show currents that are eastward (westward) in the night side.\nL03102 ZAHARIA ET AL.: STORM-TIME MAGNETIC FIELD L03102\n3 of 4\nand Bracken, 1967; Cowley, 1978; Cheng, 1992].

Farther in the tail this term can become so\nlarge in the equatorial plane that a strong bifurcation of the\ncurrent takes place [Zaharia et al., 2004].\n[16] Finally, Figure 6 shows the Birkeland current density\nJk at the top of the ionosphere. Jk is negligible before the\nstorm and in the recovery phase, but increases to \u00011 mA\/m2\nat its peak (this is significant, as all latitudes here map to\nless than 6.5 RE from Earth). There is also a clear equator-\nward drift of the currents at the storm peak.\n4. Summary and Discussion\n[17] In order to quantify the effect of plasma pressure on\nthe magnetic field during a storm, in this paper we present a\ntime series of 3-D equilibrium \u2018\u2018snapshots\u2019\u2019 of the inner\nmagnetosphere during the magnetic storm of October 21,\n2001. The snapshots are computed using magnetic flux\nboundaries obtained from the T89 empirical magnetospheric\nfield model and prescribed anisotropic pressure from the\nUNH-RAM ring current kinetic model.\n[18] A major result of the study is that during intense\nstorms plasma b? can be significant (\u000110). This shows that\nplasma pressure strongly affects the B-field even very close\nto Earth during such events. Other results include very large\nazimuthal current density (\u000120 nA\/m2), with concomitant\nincrease in the field-aligned currents at the ionosphere. Due\nto the high b?  there are large B-fie ld depressions compared\nto a dipolar field (and a decrea se even from the T89 field).\nOther computation s (not presented here), with dipole flux\nboundary conditions, also show high b?  ( \u00012) and large\nmagnetic field depressions, thus clearly showing that the\ndipolar approximation breaks down during intense storms\nand indicating the necessity of a magnetically self-consistent\ntreatment of plasma transport.\n[19] We note that the RAM model with Volland-Stern\nelectric convection underestimates the Dst index (see\nFigure 1) and thus likely the pressures as well. We found\nthat using the more realistic Weimer 01 convection model\nleads to a better reproduction of the Dst. Therefore, more\ndetailed work, to be addressed in a forthcoming JGR paper,\nwill include pressure input from the kinetic model with\nWeimer 01 convection, as well as the use of the more\nrealistic Tsyganenko T01 \u2018\u2018storm\u2019\u2019 model [Tsyganenko et\nal., 2003] for obtaining the flux BCs. The present modeling\nis a first step toward adding self-consistency to the RAM\nmodel by feeding it magnetic field computed to be in force\nbalance with the model-derived plasma pressure.\n[20] Acknowledgments.
