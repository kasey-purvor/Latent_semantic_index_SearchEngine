We determine the effective temperatures of PLZJ23 and PLZJ93 to be\n\u22481200 and \u22481100 K. From the broad-band photometry we place an upper limit of 1100 K on\nthe effective temperature of PLZJ100 but lack the data required to determine the value more\nprecisely. These temperatures are in the T dwarf regime, yet the methane colours indicate no\nmethane is present. We attribute this to youth\/low gravity in line with theoretical expectations.\nHowever, we find even less methane is present than predicted by the models.\nPLZJ23 and PLZJ93 are also very bright in the [3.6] \u03bcm waveband (PLZJ100 is not mea-\nsured) compared to field brown dwarfs which can also be explained by this lack of methane.\nThe definition of the T spectral class is the appearance of methane absorption, so strictly, via\nthis definition, PLZJ93 and PLZJ100 cannot be described as T dwarfs. The colours of these\ntwo objects are, however, not compatible with those of L dwarfs. Thus we have a classification\nproblem and cannot assign these objects a (photometric) spectral type.\nKey words: brown dwarfs \u2013 stars: low-mass \u2013 open clusters and associations: individual:\nPleiades.\n1 IN T RO D U C T I O N\nSince the discovery of the first T dwarf, Gl229B (Nakajima et al.\n1995), more than 150 have been catalogued.1 These are almost\nexclusively field dwarfs, and have been used to define the T spectral\ntype and to produce empirical sequences that describe how the\nphotometric colours change with effective temperature (e.g. Leggett\net al. 2002, 2010). However, as brown dwarfs are degenerate objects,\ntheir radii decrease as they cool (Burrows et al. 2001), making not\nonly this parameter, but also their gravity permanently linked to\ntheir evolution. There has been much work on searching for both\nT and, the earlier spectral type, L dwarfs in open star clusters as\ncluster members have a known age. This age constraint means\nthat evolutionary models (e.g. DUSTY; Chabrier et al. 2000) can\nbe used to estimate their masses and, as the majority of cluster\nmembers remain gravitationally bound, the mass function of the\ncluster can be used as a proxy for the initial mass function (IMF) of\n\u0002E-mail: slc25@star.le.ac.uk\n1 http:\/\/spider.ipac.caltech.edu\/staff\/davy\/ARCHIVE\/index.shtml\nthe cluster, and hence the Galaxy. There is much discussion as to\nthe shape of the IMF and whether it is consistent across all open star\nclusters (e.g. Moraux, Bouvier & Clarke 2005; Lodieu et al. 2007).\nInconsistencies would suggest a variety of initial conditions to star\nformation processes. The IMF can also be used to put constraints on\nthe lowest masses that can be created via star formation processes.\nThe majority of the work on the IMF to date has been based on\nL dwarfs alone. To better understand the IMF we must begin to\ndiscover more T dwarfs with a known age, thus extending the IMF\ninto the T dwarf regime. This is because only with a sample that\nencompasses a wide range in mass and age can we begin to fully\ncomprehend the IMF.\nThe majority of discovered T dwarfs, however, are field objects,\nand hence old (>5 Gyr). This means that they have no accurate\nage estimation to enable them to be used in defining the IMF, and\nempirical relations derived from colours and spectra provide little\ninformation on how gravity affects their atmospheres. To date there\nare few examples of confirmed low-gravity T dwarfs (e.g. HN Peg\nB, Luhman et al. 2007; SOri70, Zapatero Osorio et al. 2002) and one\nobject on the L\u2013T transition HD203030B (Metchev & Hillenbrand\n2006). The L\u2013T transition is the region where the dusty L dwarf\nC\u00a9 2011 The Authors\nMonthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society C\u00a9 2011 RAS\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 6, 2014\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n2072 S. L. Casewell et al.\natmospheres begin to clear, and the object\u2019s atmosphere becomes\ndominated by methane absorption, the defining characteristic of\nT dwarfs. The processes involved are not yet well understood, and\nthe majority of evolutionary models do not cover this region, instead\nhaving a \u2018dusty\u2019 set of models (e.g. DUSTY, Chabrier et al. 2000;\nC100, Burrows, Sudarsky & Hubeny 2006) and a clear atmosphere\nset of models (e.g. COND, Baraffe et al. 2003; Clr, Burrows et al.\n2006) for the later T dwarfs. Saumon & Marley (2008) attempted\nto reproduce this region using a hybrid model for the colour evo-\nlution and cooling of the brown dwarfs. They had some success\nin reproducing the photometric characteristics of the field popu-\nlation, but made less progress with the younger members of the\nPleiades cluster. These currently known low-gravity objects have\nbeen identified as such thanks to fiducial age constraints demonstrat-\ning the youth of the systems. Such objects represent benchmarks\nas with a known age (either from their being a cluster member or\nin a binary with a star\/white dwarf of a known age) they can be\nused to critically examine the predictions made by evolutionary\nmodels.\nBrown dwarfs are classified as either L or T dwarfs based on the\nstrengths of lines within their spectra, and the general spectral shape\nin comparison to standards (see Kirkpatrick 2005 for a review), al-\nthough estimates based on broad-band photometry are often made.\nFor T dwarfs, this classification is usually based on the near-infrared\n(IR) spectra (Burgasser et al. 2002; Geballe et al. 2002), while the\nhotter L dwarfs are classified using optical spectra (Kirkpatrick et al.\n1999). Obviously, to achieve any sort of classification, \u2018standard\u2019\nobjects must be selected, and so objects with unusual colours such\nas low-gravity objects were often excluded as outliers. Kirkpatrick\n(2005) notes that, for example, any L0 dwarf will fall between a\nhigher mass (\u224885 MJup), old (>a few Gyr), stellar object and a very\nyoung (<20 Myr) low-mass (<20 MJup) brown dwarf. Understand-\nably, this is a large range in mass and age, and it is therefore perhaps\nnaive to assume every L dwarf of a defined spectral type to have\nidentical photometry and indeed spectra, particularly while so many\nabsorption lines are sensitive to gravity (e.g. K I, Na I, Rb I, Cs I). It\nwas suggested in Kirkpatrick (2005) that brown dwarf classification\nhave a suffix added where \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4 could be used to denote\ndecreasing gravity. Cruz, Kirkpatrick & Burgasser (2009) have re-\ncently used this notation while creating a low-gravity sequence for\nearly L dwarfs. This follows the work of Kirkpatrick et al. (2008)\nwho studied 20 low-gravity dwarfs including eight M dwarfs and\n11 L dwarfs. Cruz et al. (2009) identified 23 low-gravity L dwarfs\nfrom L0 to L5, and began to define a low-gravity sequence based\non that presented in Kirkpatrick et al. (1999) using gravity-sensitive\nfeatures in the spectra. They use \u03b2 to describe an object of the age\nof the Pleiades and show that typically these objects are red for their\nspectral class in J \u2212 KS. It will, however, take time before a similar\nfeat can be accomplished based on late L dwarfs and T dwarfs, as\nso few are currently known.\nAs discussed earlier, open star clusters have long been the\nfavourite hunting ground for these benchmark objects as they are\ncoeval. However, as we search further into the T dwarf regime to\ncooler temperatures, it is becoming evident that the majority of\nsurveys do not probe deep enough to discover T dwarfs. To date,\nthere are two T dwarfs known in the Hyades (Bouvier et al. 2008),\nalthough at an age of 625 Myr this means that they have a gravity\nsimilar to that of field T dwarfs. SOri70 (Zapatero Osorio et al.\n2002) was discovered in \u03c3 Orionis, and it has been recently sug-\ngested that it may be surrounded by a dust disc accounting for its\nredness in the [3.6] and [4.5] \u03bcm bands (Scholz & Jayawardhana\n2008). One object was reported by Burgess et al. (2009) in IC348\nwith an estimated spectral type of T6. However, at the young age\nof this population (3 Myr), the reliability of evolutionary models is\nquestionable due to the rather ad hoc nature of the starting point of\nthese calculations (Baraffe et al. 2002).\nThere have been many studies of the Pleiades to search for young\nbrown dwarfs, although until our previous work (Casewell et al.\n2007) only L dwarfs were discovered (e.g. Bouvier et al. 1998;\nPinfield et al. 2000; Moraux, Bouvier & Stauffer 2001; Dobbie\net al. 2002; Bihain et al. 2006; Lodieu et al. 2007; Stauffer et al.\n2007). In Casewell et al. (2007), we presented the results of a\n2.5 deg2 survey of the Pleiades in near-IR and optical wavebands.\nAfter selecting candidate cluster members using the I \u2212 Z, I and\nZ \u2212 J, Z colour\u2013magnitude diagrams, we measured proper motions\nusing the 5 yr baseline between the near-IR and optical data sets.\nAfter our analysis, six candidates were consistent with being late\nL or early T dwarfs. These objects are far too faint to obtain a\nspectrum with which to confirm their nature, and so we present\nhere additional photometry in the form of Spitzer IRAC [3.6] and\n[4.5] \u03bcm bands, methane imaging and near-IR K-band imaging of\nthe faintest candidates. This additional information will allow us\nto place constraints on atmospheric models appropriate to a young\ncluster and hence a low-gravity environment.\n2 O B S E RVAT I O N S A N D DATA R E D U C T I O N\n2.1 The methane imaging and its reduction\nMethane imaging is a very useful tool for determining whether a\nbrown dwarf is a bona fide T dwarf when a spectrum is not avail-\nable as shown by Tinney et al. (2005). As T dwarfs get cooler,\nmethane absorption becomes more dominant in the H band as\nseen in Fig. 1. The magenta curve (long-dashed line) is a T0.5\ndwarf, SDSS J015141.69+124429.6 (Geballe et al. 2002) which\nshows very little methane absorption. The flux in the H band\nforms a broad hump. However, as we progress to the T4.5\ndwarf, 2MASS J05591914\u22121404488 (green, short-dashed line;\nBurgasser et al. 2000), this region, and in particular the red side\nof the flux, appears to have been suppressed by the presence\nof methane in the atmosphere. This is further shown in the T8\nFigure 1. The H passband (\u22481.45\u20131.85\u00b5m) with the CH4 short filter (thick\nblack line), CH4 long filter (thin black line) and three field T dwarfs,\nSDSS J015141.69+124429.6 (T0.5, magenta dotted line), J05591914\u2212\n1404488 (T4.5, green long-dashed line) and 2MASS J0415195\u2212\n093506 (T8, blue dashed line). The effect of methane absorption is clearly\nseen in the H band of the later T dwarfs.\nC\u00a9 2011 The Authors, MNRAS 412, 2071\u20132078\nMonthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society C\u00a9 2011 RAS\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 6, 2014\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nMethane and Spitzer imaging of the Pleiades 2073\ndwarf, 2MASS J0415195\u2212093506 (blue, dotted line; Burgasser\net al. 2002), which shows sharply peaked flux in this region. We can\nfurther characterize the degree of methane absorption by using the\nmethane filters, CH4 \u2018long\u2019 (grey line in Fig. 1) and \u2018short\u2019 (black\nline in Fig. 1). We can calculate a methane colour index CH4s\u22124l,\nwhich will be negative for objects with a late T spectral type as all\nthe flux is in the short filter and not the long (where the majority of\nthe methane absorption is occurring).\nWe imaged each of the five T dwarf candidates from Casewell\net al. (2007; PLZJ93, PLZJ721, PLZJ235, PLZJ112 and PLZJ100)\nusing near infrared imager (NIRI) on Gemini North in both the\nmethane short and methane long filters on the nights of 2007\nSeptember 2 and 4. We requested that the seeing be better than\n1.2 arcsec and that the cloud cover was at the 70th percentile or\nbetter (corresponding to at worst, thin cirrus). It was noted in the\nobserving log there was some passing cloud on the observation\nof PLZJ100, but this does not appear to have affected the images.\nThe remaining candidate, PLZJ23, has an estimated photometric\nspectral type of L8, and therefore was not observed as part of the\nmethane imaging programme.\nNIRI consists of a 1024\u00d71024 pixel ALADDIN InSb array and\nwhen combined with the f\/6 camera, provides a plate scale of\n0.117 arcsec pixel\u22121 and a field of view of 120\u00d7120 arcsec. The\ndata were obtained using a nine-point dither pattern and total expo-\nsure times of 30 mins for the CH4s filter and 1 h for the CH4l filter.\nWe also observed a known T5 dwarf 2MASS J04070885+1514565\n(Burgasser et al. 2004) for 1 min in both the CH4s and CH4l filters\nto act as a standard object with which to check our results.\nThe images were reduced using IRAF (Image Reduction and Anal-\nysis Facility), the gemini package v1.9 and the NIRI specific tasks.\nFirst the images were prepared using the NPREPARE task which\nadds key words to the image headers in preparation for data reduc-\ntion. A sky frame was then created from the images using NISKY,\nwhich median combined each science image after masking out any\nobjects. This sky frame was used instead of dark frames, as having\nbeen taken concurrently with the science images, it gives a better\nmeasurement of the dark current. The NIREDUCE task was then\nused to subtract the sky frame from the science images. Flat field\nimages are taken for NIRI in both a \u2018lamp on\u2019 and a \u2018lamp off\u2019\nmode. These are essentially high and low dome flats and are used\nto separate the instrument thermal signature from the instrument\nresponse. The flat field was created by subtracting the median-\ncombined \u2018lamp off\u2019 frames from the single \u2018lamp on\u2019 frames and\nmedian combining. This flat field was then normalized by dividing\nby the mean pixel value with NIFLAT. The XDIMSUM package and\nthe XMOSAIC task were then used to combine the individual flat\nfielded science frames. This processing resulted in two images for\neach object, a CH4l image and a CH4s image. The images were then\nastrometrically calibrated using the Starlink packages AUTOASTROM\nand GAIA, and the object extraction routine SEXTRACTOR was run. All\nsources in the images with good photometry were then selected, and\nJ- and K-band photometry obtained for them from the UKIRT In-\nfrared Deep Sky Survey\u2019s Galactic Cluster Survey (UKIDSS GCS;\nLawrence et al. 2007) Data Release 6. Stellar sources were then\nselected using the flags from UKIDSS and their J \u2212 K colours were\nthen used with fig. 4 of Tinney et al. (2005) to estimate the spectral\ntype for these reference objects (typically between 12 and 20 objects\nwere used). As NIRI and IRIS2 have the same methane filter set,\nequation (2) from Tinney et al. (2005) was then used to calculate the\ntheoretical CH4s \u2212 CH4l colour. The measured CH4s \u2212 CH4l were\nthen plotted against the theoretical colour and used to determine\nthe zero-point for the data. This zero-point was then applied to the\nFigure 2.

The zero-points for each of the reference objects\nused are shown in Figs 2 and 3, and the scatter in the standards is\ntypically about 10 per cent.\nWe checked the reliability of our method by using\n2MASS J04070885+1514565. We had fewer standards, as the\nUKIDSS large area survey (LAS) has not covered this region yet,\nand so we used Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) with the\ntransforms presented by (Carpenter 2001) to convert between the\n2MASS and MKO filter set. The resultant CH4s \u2212 CH4l colour was\n\u22120.569 \u00b1 0.0293 which is consistent with colours for a T5 dwarf.\nThe methane images had much higher signal-to-noise ratio than\nthe original detection images, and in some cases, this means we\nwere able to identify our targets as non-stellar objects. On close\nexamination of the images, PLZJ235 appears to be a galaxy with\na measured ellipticity of 1.53 (Fig. 4). PLZJ112 appears to be a\ngalaxy, but is much less elongated than PLZJ235, and only has an\nellipticity of 0.28. PLZJ721 does not appear to be a galaxy, but it\nhas a measured ellipticity of 2.02. However, it has a methane colour\nindex of 0.25\u00b10.09 which is consistent with both PLZJ235 and\nPLZJ112 and is also slightly offset from its position as measured\nC\u00a9 2011 The Authors, MNRAS 412, 2071\u20132078\nMonthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society C\u00a9 2011 RAS\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 6, 2014\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n2074 S.

The target is marked by the cross. These two\nobjects appear to be stellar, and hence members of the Pleiades.\nby our original WFCAM images. This indicates that in our original\nanalysis (Casewell et al. 2007) it may only have been a marginal\ndetection of part of an elliptical object. This would also account for\nthe previous motion derived.\nPLZJ93 and PLZJ100, however, appear to be stellar with elliptic-\nities of 0.30 and 0.23, respectively (Fig. 5). Using the NIRI images,\nwe have also attempted to measure proper motions for these objects;\nhowever the small field of view means that the errors are too large\nto be an improvement on the measurements presented in Casewell\net al. (2007). The proper motions are, however, consistent with the\nearlier results. The final magnitudes are shown in Table 1.\n2.2 The Spitzer imaging and its reduction\nWe have also obtained Spitzer IRAC (Fazio et al. 2004) photometry\nfrom Cycle 4 (Programme ID:40482, PI: Jameson) in the [3.6]\nand [4.5] \u03bcm bands using IRAC mapping mode to observe all of\nour remaining targets (PLZJ23, PLZJ93 and PLZJ100) on 2007\nOctober 17 and 2008 September 21. PLZJ100, however, is too close\nto a much brighter object for us to measure its photometry and so\nthe data presented here is for PLZJ23 and PLZJ93 only. The data\nwere observed using 100 s integrations and the standard medium 18-\npoint dither pattern and the full array giving a total exposure time\nof 1800 s per pointing. We used the basic calibrated data (BCD)\nimages and the standard reduction method with the recommended\nTable 2.

We then used the array correction mosaic to cor-\nrect for the array location dependence and the relevant zero-point.\nChannel 1 ([3.6] \u03bcm) also had a pixel phase correction applied. The\nIRAC zero-magnitude flux densities as found on the Spitzer web-\nsite were then used to convert the flux into magnitudes on the Vega\nmagnitude scale (Table 2). The photometric errors were estimated\nusing the Poisson noise given by the apex software which was then\ncombined with the errors on the zero-points. The 3 per cent absolute\ncalibration was added in quadrature to these photometric errors. We\nconfirmed this error estimate was accurate by creating three stacks of\nsix individual images in each channel to corroborate the measured\nrange of magnitudes was within the previously calculated error\nrange.\n2.3 Additional H- and K-band photometry\nAs our original data was in the I, Z and J bands and in limited cases\nalso in the H band, we obtained time on UKIRT with the UKIRT\nFast Track Imager (UFTI) in semester 2007B to observe our candi-\ndates in the H and K bands. Unfortunately, bad weather meant that\nonly K-band data were obtained for PLZJ100 on 2008 January 26.\nThese data were reduced using the ORAC-DR pipeline provided\nas part of the Starlink packages, and the mosaics combined using\nthe iraf v2.12.2a (Tody 1986) XDIMSUM package and the XMOSAIC\ntask as described below. The SExtractor was used to extract objects\nwith stellar profiles from the images, and these objects were then\ncross-correlated with the UKIDSS GCS catalogue to provide a pho-\ntometric zero-point and calibrate the image. The target\u2019s apparent\nmagnitude is given in Table 1, and the J \u2212 K, K colour\u2013magnitude\ndiagram for the cluster is shown in Fig. 6.\n3 R ESULTS\nOur new results leave three Pleiades candidates, PLZJ23, PLZJ93\nand PLZJ100.

The vertical\ndot\u2013dashed line is at 1100 K, the effective temperature of PLZJ93.\ntheir proper motions are indicative of their being cluster members\n(Casewell et al. 2007). PLZJ93 and 100 also appear to have methane\nindices indicative of stellar objects and have low ellipticities on the\nimages. Their methane colours (Table 1) are not, however, consistent\nwith the spectral types that are suggested by the broad-band colours\nand are more indicative of late L or early T types. Additionally, this\nlack of methane absorption is not consistent with their being field\ndwarfs.\nFig. 7 shows the DUSTY (Chabrier et al. 2000) and COND\n(Baraffe et al. 2003) models that were generated in the NIRI methane\nfilter set using the Phoenix web simulator (http:\/\/phoenix.ens-\nlyon.fr\/simulator\/index.faces). Both sets of models have been cal-\nculated for 5 and 120 Myr. It can be seen that we would expect\nless methane absorption at a given temperature for the lower grav-\nity, younger Pleiades objects using the COND models (which are\nappropriate at this temperature) than for field objects at 5 Gyr.\nThis result is not wholly surprising. Saumon & Marley (2008)\ncreated isochrones at the age of the Pleiades, but discovered that in\norder to make their model isochrones a better fit with the members\nof the Pleiades identified in Casewell et al. (2007), they need to\nlower the effective temperature of the L\u2013T transition which is set at\n1200\u20131400 K. This suggests that for younger ages and hence lower\ngravities, the L\u2013T transition may happen at a lower effective tem-\nperature. This is consistent with the analysis of HN Peg B presented\nby Leggett et al. (2008). In IC348, Burgess et al. (2009) find that\nfor younger objects, a cooler temperature is expected for the same\nmethane colour. This is consistent with the assumption that the L\u2013T\ntransition, and hence the onset of methane absorption, occurs at a\nlower temperature for younger (lower gravity) objects.\nThe recent spectroscopic study on the Pleiades L dwarfs by Bihain\net al. (2010) also finds evidence of low-gravity features in some\nearly L dwarfs. These spectra show the characteristic triangular-\nshaped bump in the H band as seen in young L dwarfs in Trapezium\n(Lucas & Roche 2000). This shape could be due to a reduction in\nthe H2 collision induced molecular hydrogen absorption (H2CIA)\nand water absorption in a low-gravity and dustier environment than\nis commonly seen in field L dwarfs (Borysow, Jorgensen & Zheng\n1997; Kirkpatrick et al. 2006; Mohanty et al. 2007). This dustier\nenvironment is consistent with the L\u2013T transition happening at a\nlower temperature in the Pleiades. This youth and dusty atmosphere\nis also given as a reason for the redder J \u2212 K colours seen in the\nPleiades L dwarfs compared to field dwarfs as the H2CIA opacity\nalso affects the K band and depends on the square of the gas density\n(Knapp et al. 2004), which is lower at lower gravity, making the\natmosphere more transparent and hence the flux brighter.\nA similar effect was seen by Lodieu et al. (2008) in Upper Scor-\npius where numerous candidates with spectral types between M and\nmid-L were selected from the UKIDSS GCS using photometry, but\nspectra revealed them to all have much earlier spectral types than\nexpected. This led the authors to deduce that the J \u2212 K colour for\nyoung L dwarfs is much redder than older L dwarfs of the same\nspectral type.\nTo compare the PLZJ23, PLZJ93 and PLZJ100 with models,\nwe have derived effective temperatures using an almost model-\nindependent method described in the following paragraphs. To do\nthis, we must assume that PLZJ23, PLZJ93 and PLZJ100 are all\nsingle objects, and indeed, we have no evidence of their being\nbinaries.\nWith the I, Z, J, H, K, [3.6] and [4.5] filter measured magni-\ntudes, it is possible to sum the corresponding fluxes, add a small\nmodelled contribution from the wavelengths not covered and thus,\nusing the distance to the Pleiades, obtain the bolometric luminosity.\nIf we further assume a suitable brown dwarf radius, we can then\ndetermine the effective temperature. We have used the distance to\nthe Pleiades (133 pc; An et al. 2007), the AMES-COND spectra\n(Allard et al. 2001), MK and the age of the Pleiades (125 Myr;\nStauffer, Schultz & Kirkpatrick 1998) to calculate the brown dwarf\nradii, R.\nWe then converted our Vega magnitudes to intensities, using the\nstandard zero-magnitude intensities (Bessell, Castelli & Plez 1998).\nThese were then multiplied by the known filter widths to obtain\nfluxes. These fluxes were then summed and multiplied by 4\u03c0d2,\nwhere d is 133 pc (the distance to the Pleiades) to get most of the\nbolometric luminosity.\nThe above paragraph describes the principle of the method and\nalso provides a first Teff estimate, using the method below. However,\nthe Vega spectrum is very different from that of a brown dwarf. Thus\nfor each filter, we integrate the Vega spectrum over the filter trans-\nmission profile. We also integrate an AMES-COND spectrum with\nthe first estimate Teff over the filter profile. Comparing the two gives\nthe normalization factor of the AMES-COND spectrum. Finally, we\nintegrate the AMES-COND spectrum over the wavelength region\nC\u00a9 2011 The Authors, MNRAS 412, 2071\u20132078\nMonthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society C\u00a9 2011 RAS\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 6, 2014\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n2076 S. L. Casewell et al.\nwhere the transmission exceeds 5 per cent to calculate the total filter\nflux. As above, then summing the filter fluxes and multiplying by\n4\u03c0d2 gives the majority of the bolometric luminosity.\nTo get the total luminosity, we then have to add a very small con-\ntribution for the fluxes that lie between the I, Z, J, H, K and the [3.6]\nand [4.5] filters and also a contribution for the flux redwards of the\n[4.5] \u03bcm filter (i.e. >5.0 \u03bcm). To do this, we make an estimate of\nthe effective temperature and used the AMES-COND model spec-\ntra (Allard et al. 2001) to obtain the surface brightness in the above\nregions. We then sum these surface brightnesses and multiply by\nthe surface area of the brown dwarf using the radii given in the\nCOND model isochrones (Baraffe et al. 2003). This contribution is\nthen added to the observed luminosity to obtain the total luminos-\nity. We find, depending slightly on which dwarf is measured, that\n\u224890 per cent of the total luminosity is observed and only \u224810 per\ncent is derived from the models.\nWe then used the relationship between R\/R\u0004, L\/L\u0004 and Teff \/K\nto calculate the effective temperature. We then iterated the calcula-\ntion using the calculated effective temperature instead of the esti-\nmated one when calculating the surface brightness from the model\nspectra.\nOur results are an effective temperature of 1121\u00b150 and\n1252\u00b150 K for PLZJ93 and PLZJ23, respectively (we shall assume\nvalues of \u22481100 and \u22481200 K hereafter). The main source of error\non this calculation is from the measured photometry (which is in\ngeneral 10 per cent photometry). A further source of error due to the\nassumed model radius is given in the following section. As we have\nno Spitzer magnitudes or H band for PLZJ100, we cannot estimate\nits Teff other than to say its broad-band and methane colour mean\nis likely cooler than PLZJ93, and so we can give an upper limit on\nthe effective temperature of \u22481100 K. These temperatures corre-\nspond to masses between 11 and 12MJup using the COND models\nfor 120 Myr (Baraffe et al. 2003).\n4 D ISCUSSION\nThe estimated temperatures and the COND models for 120 Myr can\nbe used to estimate the amount of H-band methane absorption we\nexpect in these objects. Fig. 7 shows both objects are expected to\nhave \u22121.0 > CH4s \u2212 CH4l > \u22120.5. Both PLZJ93 and PLZJ100\nare observed to have positive methane indices, however indicating\nno methane absorption. Thus low gravity seems to have a greater\neffect on the L\u2013T transition than the models predict.\nHow robust is this result? Clearly it depends on our measured\neffective temperatures being correct. If Teff was in fact as high as\n1400 K, then we would not expect a negative methane colour index.\nAs explained above, the L\/L\u0004 values only depend on the models at\na 10 per cent level. Saumon & Marley (2008) have pointed out that\nthe structural parameters L\/L\u0004 and R\/R\u0004 show good agreement\nbetween models by various authors. Also, the modelled R\/R\u0004 varies\nvery slowly with mass, only 2 per cent change is seen in the radius\nfor a factor of 4 change in mass at the age of the Pleiades. If we\nadd a \u00b120 Myr uncertainty (which is larger than the limits given by\nStauffer et al. 1998) on the age of the Pleiades, then this introduces\na \u00b15 per cent error in R\/R\u0004 and thus a 2 per cent error on the\neffective temperature. We therefore believe our estimates of Teff are\nrobust. The COND model isochrones (Baraffe et al. 2003) give a\nlog g = 4.3 for both PLZJ93 and PLZJ100. Old (5 Gyr) field dwarfs\nof the same effective temperature (Teff \u2248 1100 K) have a log g =\n5.4. This leads us to be confident that lowering the gravity by a\nfactor of 10 has a dramatic effect on methane absorption, reducing\nthe field dwarf methane colour index from \u2248\u22120.8 to a small but\npositive value.\nWe now compare PLZJ93 with field dwarfs of similar effective\ntemperatures at other wavelengths. Warren et al. (2007) find a\nrelationship between effective temperature and H \u2212 [4.5] colour\nfor field dwarfs. Using this relationship we have determined that\nat 1100 K, the effective temperature of PLZJ93, H \u2212 [4.5] =\n2.1. Taking data from Patten et al. (2006), Table 3 gives the\ncolours of several field dwarfs (2MASSI J0755480+221218,\n2MASSI J2339101+135230, 2MASSI J2356547\u2212155310,\n2MASSI J1534498\u2212295227, 2MASSI J1546291\u2212332511) at this\nH \u2212 [4.5] colour, which corresponds to spectra types T5\u2013T5.5,\nan average T dwarf calculated from these field dwarfs, and the\ncolours of PLZJ93. The bottom two rows of Table 3 allow us to\ncompare PLZJ93 with an average field dwarf of the same effective\ntemperature.\nAs expected, J \u2212 H is redder for PLZJ93 since it shows no\nmethane absorption, and so is brighter in the H band. J \u2212 K is\nalso redder for PLZJ93, meaning that it is brighter in the K band\nthan in the field dwarf. Methane absorption and H2CIA both occur\nin the K band, and H2CIA in particular is very sensitive to pres-\nsure and gravity (Borysow et al. 1997). This H2CIA is weak for\nlow-gravity dwarfs, which when combined with the H2O opacity,\nwhich also decreases with gravity combines to change the profiles\nof the H- and K-band fluxes (Mohanty et al. 2007), makes the H\nband more peaked and the K band brighter. This effect in the H\nband was first seen by Lucas & Roche (2000) in cool brown dwarf\ncandidates in the Trapezium, and has also been noted in spectra\nof Pleiades L dwarfs by Bihain et al. (2010). We thus suggest that\nthe brighter K-band magnitude for PLZJ93 is due to the combina-\ntion of reduced opacity from methane and H2CIA in a low-gravity\natmosphere which contributes to the red H \u2212 K and J \u2212 K colours\nseen here.\nThere is another methane band present in the [3.6] IRAC fil-\nter and so we expect PLZJ93 to be bright in this filter as well.\nThis proves, quite dramatically, to be the case with a J \u2212 [3.6]\ncolour difference of \u22482 between PLZJ93 and the field compar-\nison. Fig. 8 shows the K \u2212 [3.6], [3.6] \u2212 [4.5] two-colour di-\nagram for field stars from Patten et al. (2006) and PLZJ93 and\nPLZJ100. The two Pleiads stand very clearly above the field star\nsequence.\nAlso shown in Fig. 8 is the low-gravity T dwarf HN Peg B. HN\nPeg B has a spectral type of T2\u20133 and if it were a field dwarf, it\nwould have an effective temperature of 1200\u20131400 K and a log \u2248\n5.0. However, using the age of the system, which is relatively well\nconstrained at 300\u00b1200 Myr, and evolutionary models, the effective\ntemperature is calculated to be \u22481000 K (Leggett et al. 2008). In-\nterestingly, HN Peg B does show the expected amount of methane\nabsorption. Using the infrared telescope facility (IRTF) Spex in-\nfrared spectrum presented in Luhman et al. (2007) and integrating\nover the methane filter profiles, we find CH4s \u2212 CH4l = \u22120.42.\nThis is consistent with a T2\u20133 dwarf (as one would expect as the\nspectrum was used to determine the spectral type). A comparison\nof the Li measurements for HN Peg A with local open clusters\nindicates that the system is older than the Pleiades (Chen et al.\n2001), despite the error bar on the age encompassing 100 Myr. This\nsuggests that while the mid-IR colours at [3.6] and [4.5] \u03bcm are\naffected by low gravity up to the age of 300 Myr, the effects of low\ngravity on methane absorption occur at much younger ages.

Our Pleiads (and HN Peg B)\ndo not show this ([3.6] \u2212 [4.5] \u2248 0.3\u20130.4; IC348_CH4_2 [3.6] \u2212\n[4.5] \u2248 0.9) or the blue K \u2212 [3.6] colour as seen in the IC348 object,\nindicating that they are of an earlier spectral type with less methane\nabsorption. It is clear, however, that the K \u2212 [3.6], [3.6] \u2212 [4.5]\ntwo-colour diagram is an excellent diagnostic for low gravity and\nhence youth.\nThe J \u2212 [4.5] colour also shows an excess for PLZJ93 over\nthe template field dwarf. The reason for this is not obvious. The\n[4.5] filter covers the CO band, with the band edge at 4.6 \u03bcm. No\nmethane in the object should mean more CO (for a fixed amount\nof C), and therefore more absorption. Recently Yamamura, Tsuji\n& Tanabe (2010) have seen evidence of CO and CO2 in the [4.5]\nfilter in L dwarfs and it is stronger than predicted by models. In\nthe past, the CO has been attributed to vertical mixing in the atmo-\nspheres (Oppenheimer et al. 1998); however, it remains to be seen\nif low gravity is affecting the CO2 and thus removing this source of\nabsorption.\nThe H \u2212 [4.5] colour of PLZJ93 (Teff = 1107 K) is 3.03 which\ndoes not fit the Warren et al. (2007) relation for field stars cooler\nthan 1000 K. This relation was also confirmed by Leggett et al.\n(2010) who also noted that it became stronger below 800 K but\nused the low scatter in the relationship to determine that it is not\ngravity sensitive in this temperature regime. At higher temperatures,\nsuch as for PLZJ93, the relation is quite likely to be gravity\/age\nsensitive.\nPLZJ23, PLZJ93 and PLZJ100 are all clearly cooler than field\ndwarfs with spectral type T0, but none of them has any methane\nabsorption as judged by their methane colour index. We assume\nPLZJ23 has a positive methane colour index, but due to its broad-\nband spectral type being estimated at L8, it was not observed in\nmethane filters. The definition of the T spectral class is the ap-\npearance of methane, so strictly, via this definition, PLZJ93 and\nPLZJ100 cannot be described as T dwarfs. The colours of these two\nobjects are, however, not compatible with those of field L dwarfs\nas presented in Leggett et al. (2002). Our colours for these Pleiades\ndwarfs also do not appear to be consistent with the colour types\npresented in Cruz et al. (2009) for a low-gravity L dwarf sequence\nup until L5. The colours of a low-gravity L5 dwarf are given as J \u2212\nH = 1.52 \u00b1 0.04 and J \u2212 Ks = 2.52 \u00b1 0.03. Our objects are much\nbluer than this. It may however be the case that low-gravity late L\ndwarfs show notably different colours to high-gravity late L dwarfs\nwhich may explain this discrepancy. This may be an additional in-\ndication that the L\u2013T transition occurs at a lower temperature in\nlow-gravity objects than for high-gravity objects. It does appear,\nhowever, that until an L dwarf sequence is available for low-gravity\nlate L and early T dwarfs, we have a classification problem and\ncannot assign these Pleiads an estimated spectral type based upon\ntheir photometry.\nIf spectra could be observed for PLZJ23, PLZJ93 and PLZJ100,\nit might be possible to classify them as late low-gravity L dwarfs,\ni.e. an extension of the low-gravity sequence started in Bihain et al.\n(2010), for the Pleiades, and Cruz et al. (2009), for field dwarfs.\n5 SU M M A RY\nUsing methane and Spitzer IRAC imaging, we have shown that\nthree of the six L\u2013T dwarf candidates discovered by Casewell et al.\n(2007) are likely galaxies. Of the remaining three, all have photom-\netry that shows that they are likely members of the Pleiades open\nstar cluster and are low-gravity L and T dwarfs. Our findings are\nconsistent with those of Burgess et al. (2009) on IC348 and Bihain\net al. (2010) on L dwarfs in the Pleiades as we also see a redder J \u2212\nK colour and an inhibited methane absorption in these low-gravity\nPleiads compared to field dwarfs. We have also discovered a prob-\nlem with the classification of these objects as we have shown their\natmospheres contain no methane, meaning they cannot be described\nas T dwarfs. They are, however, not L dwarfs, as their broad-band\ncolours show. We thus have a classification problem and are unable\nto assign these objects a (photometrically based) spectral type.\nC\u00a9 2011 The Authors, MNRAS 412, 2071\u20132078\nMonthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society C\u00a9 2011 RAS\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 6, 2014\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n2078 S.
