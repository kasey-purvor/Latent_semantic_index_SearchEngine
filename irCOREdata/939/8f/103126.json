But do subtle differences in equity\nwithin more similar contexts matter as well? Here we compare Italy and Spain, two countries\nwith low fertility levels and institutional reliance on kinship and family, but with employment\nequity among women during the 1990s slightly greater in Italy than Spain. The European\nCommunity Household Panel is used to explore the effect of this difference in gender equity on\nthe likelihood of married couples having a second birth during this time period. Women\u2019s hours\nof employment reduce the birth likelihood in both countries, but non-maternal sources of care\noffset this effect to different degrees. In Spain, private childcare significantly increases birth\nlikelihood, whereas in Italy, father\u2019s greater childcare share increases the likelihood, particularly\namong employed women. These results suggest that increases in women\u2019s employment equity\nincrease not only the degree of equity within the home, but also the beneficial effects of equity on\nfertility. These equity effects help to offset the negative relationship historically found between\nfemale employment and fertility.\nFamilies process state, market and personal resources to negotiate their particular\nhousehold mix of productive and reproductive activities, yet only recently have\nwe begun to compare the household division of labour and its effect on family\noutcomes across societies. One body of work looks at policy effects on gender\nequity within the home (Cooke, 2007a; Stier and Lewin-Epstein, 2007), while\nanother assesses the impact of gender equity in the household division of labour\non fertility (Cooke, 2004; Ola\u00b4h, 2003; Torr and Short, 2004). Economists such\nas Gary Becker (1981, 1985) argue these two are at cross-purposes, with any\nincrease in women\u2019s employment predicted to decrease women\u2019s desired number\nof children. A growing group of theorists across disciplines, however, argue\ninstead that equity is the only sustainable gender order in the post-industrial\nworld of less sta employment and more diverse families (Fraser, 1997; McDonald,\n2000; Oppenheimer, 1997).\nWhen analysed at the aggregate or household level, the evidence in support of\neither hypothesis of gender equity effects on fertility remains inconclusive. Until\n2 lynn prince cooke\nrecently, aggregate fertility was higher in countries where women\u2019s aggregate\nemployment was lower, but the sign of that relationship reversed in the 1990s\n(Sleebos, 2003). At the individual level \u2013 where couples actually negotiate a\ndivision of labour and have children \u2013 effects vary in context. Among US\ncouples, the most gendered and most egalitarian housework arrangements are\nboth positively associated with fertility, although odds are slightly greater among\nthe more egalitarian couples (Torr and Short, 2004). For German couples, male\nbreadwinner families are more likely to have a second child, but father\u2019s greater\nparticipation in childcare also increases the odds (Cooke, 2004). In Sweden and\nHungary, the likelihood of second birth is greater when couples share family\nresponsibilities as compared with couples with more gendered divisions of paid\nand unpaid labour (Ola\u00b4h, 2003).\nEquity effects on fertility appear to vary by the degree to which policy or\ncultural elements reinforce women\u2019s responsibility for unpaid care work. (West)\nGerman policies historically reinforced women\u2019s responsibility for the private\nsphere and economic dependence on a male breadwinner (Cooke, 2004). Socialist\nHungary and social-democratic Sweden historically provided a web of services\nand policies supporting full employment of all able-bodied adults (Ola\u00b4h, 2003).\nIn the liberal US regime, policy has supported equal education and employment\nopportunities for women through Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but\nremains silent regarding how demands from the private sphere are met (Cooke,\n2007a). Taken together, this evidence suggests that the more policy encourages\ngreater equity in the division of paid and unpaid labour, the more gender equity\nenhances family fertility.\nMcDonald (2000) offers a structural argument for this covariation between\npolicy and equity effects on fertility. He claims fertility declines most sharply\nwhere there is conflict between gender equity in individual-level versus family-\nlevel institutions. To date, however, there are no suitable institutional measures\nwith which to assess this claim. Instead, the analysis here focuses on examining\nwhether individual gender equity effects on fertility differ across two countries\nwith similar institutional structures vis-a`-vis gender equity. Italy and Spain are\nMediterranean countries that industrialised later than their northern neighbours;\nboth rely on extended kinship networks in the provision of individual welfare\n(Ferrera, 2005), as of 2000 had similar female labour force participation rates\n(OECD, 2007) and have experienced a dramatic decline in fertility rates since the\n1960s (Kohler et al., 2002). Yet the countries also differ slightly in terms of women\u2019s\nreturn to education, the structure of female employment and the gender earnings\ngap (OECD, 2002, 2004, 2007). Using seven waves of the European Community\nHousehold Panel (ECHP), we explore whether the slight differences in gender\nequity across the 1990s in these two countries yielded differences in equity effects\non fertility.\ngender equity and fertility in italy and spain 3\nFamily in the state\nIndividual-level theories of the gendered division of household labour model it\nas a negotiation based on each partner\u2019s relative resources, with earnings and\neducation key sources of relative power (Blood and Wolfe, 1960). These models\npredicted women\u2019s rising employment would lead to a revolution in domestic\ngender roles, a revolution that failed to occur. Breen and Cooke (2005) suggest\nthis is because a given woman\u2019s individual resources are not sufficient to shift\nthe gendered division; what is necessary is that the proportion of economically\nautonomous women must be sufficiently high to change men\u2019s beliefs about\nwhat a partner would expect in the domestic sphere: in other words, greater\naggregate equity begets greater individual-level equity. A broad range of policies \u2013\nincluding education, labour and family law, social insurance and public and\nprivate transfers \u2013 shapes aggregate gender equity (Cooke, 2007a). Assessing\nthese dynamics using US and German panel data, Cooke (2007a, 2007b) found\nwomen\u2019s individual resources predicted very little shift in men\u2019s housework hours,\nalthough some structural factors predicted that men will increase their housework\nhours. Individual as well as structural factors predicted significant differences in\nwomen\u2019s housework hours. Where policies enhance women\u2019s aggregate resources,\nthey spend fewer hours in domestic tasks. Together this evidence supports the\nimportance of policy effects on gender equity in paid and unpaid labour, as\nargued by Breen and Cooke.\nYet specialisation and trading models of family (Oppenheimer, 1997) posit\nthat women\u2019s greater equity in employment incurs an \u2018opportunity cost\u2019 of\nchildren that predicts lower fertility (Becker, 1981, 1985). Such a negative\nrelationship is worrisome for welfare states, as it forces them to choose between\nbolstering the current tax base via women\u2019s employment versus the future tax\nbase via children, reflecting the Achilles heel of welfare state \u2018familialism\u2019 (Esping-\nAndersen, 1999: 70). This familialism stems from state reliance on the family as\nthe welfare provider of first resort (Esping-Andersen, 1990), and women\u2019s unpaid\ncare work under a male breadwinner model (Lewis, 1992).\nFraser (1997) notes, however, that these policy assumptions about the gender\norder centred on the ideal of a family wage. Beginning in the nineteenth century,\ntrade unions and the working class bargained for wages enabling a working\nman to support a dependent wife and several children, with first welfare state\nprovisions in most countries providing some type of insurance for interruptions\nin the male wage (Pierson, 1998). These ideals experienced their last hurrah\nduring the welfare state expansion and baby boom through the 1950s and 1960s.\nFraser (1997) argues a family wage system is no longer tenable within highly\ncompetitive, liberalised labour markets that denote post-industrial societies.\nAs male employment becomes more precarious, particularly for new labour\nmarket entrants, women\u2019s employment enhances family economic flexibility\n4 lynn prince cooke\n(Oppenheimer, 1997). US evidence supports this assertion: employed US women\nare now more likely to marry than unemployed women (Sweeney, 2002), and\nUS marriage rates have been declining at a faster rate among the least-educated\nwomen (Moffitt, 2000).\nDuring the transition from industrial to post-industrial societies, the\nobserved relationship between aggregate female employment and fertility also\nshifted. While historically the correlation between the two across OECD countries\nhad been negative, in the 1990s it became positive (McDonald, 2000; Sleebos,\n2003). Welfare state provisions in the Scandinavian countries and market services\nin the English-speaking countries supportive of maternal employment are\ncredited for this trend reversal (Brewster and Rindfuss, 2000; Sleebos, 2003).\nDuring the same time period, however, very low fertility spread rapidly in\nsouthern Europe (Kohler et al., 2002).\nMcDonald (2000) argues these trends reflect the degree of institutional\nconflict between gender equity achieved in education and the labour market,\nand equity as related to the family \u2013 including the degree of flexibility in\nemployment, extent of supportive services such as public day care and maternity\nleave \u2212 and within family members\u2019 roles. Policies upholding a male breadwinner\nmodel block the evolution in gender equity that proves adaptive as nations\nmove from industrial to post-industrial economies. Male breadwinner policies\nare prevalent within corporatist-conservative welfare regimes reinforcing other\nstatus hierarchies as well, such as between skilled and unskilled workers (Esping-\nAndersen, 1990). As male employment has become more precarious over the\npast few decades, corporatist-conservative regimes deepened insider\u2013outsider\ncleavages by protecting secure positions of older, privileged male workers at the\nexpense of job security among new labour market entrants (Esping-Andersen,\n1999). In addition to facing a protracted youth-to-adult transition, today\u2019s\nyoung adults are also more likely to face fixed-term contracts and part-time\nrather than full-time employment (Taylor-Gooby, 2004). So now, corporatist-\nconservative regimes can no longer offer the secure employment necessary to\na male breadwinner model and have minimal supports in place for the female\nemployment that enhances family economic flexibility. As a result, aggregate\nlevels of female labour force participation rates and total fertility rates are lower\nin regimes with male breadwinner policies such as Germany, Belgium and the\nNetherlands, than in Scandinavia or the English-speaking countries (Brewster\nand Rindfuss, 2000; Sleebos, 2003).\nThe female employment\/fertility trade-off under the male breadwinner\nmodel becomes more acute the greater the precariousness of male employment,\nwhich explains why female employment and fertility tend to be lower in the\nsouthern versus northern European countries (Adsera, 2003). In Italy and Spain,\nfor example, traditional gender roles and women\u2019s responsibility for the domestic\nsphere were institutionalised in authoritarian state structures prior to the late\ngender equity and fertility in italy and spain 5\nindustrialisation that began in the 1960s in Italy (Bernardi and Nazio, 2005)\nand 1970s in Spain (Jurado Guerrero and Naldini, 1996). As detailed in the next\nsection, macro-economic factors since that time have made male employment\nextremely precarious. These simultaneous factors intensify the trade-off between\nfemale employment and fertility because traditional male breadwinner families\nare institutionally supported but no longer economically feasible, while dual-\nearner families are the most economically viable yet are not institutionally\nsupported. Consequently, Italy and Spain have among the lowest female labour\nforce participation and total fertility rates of all OECD countries (OECD, 2007;\nWHOSIS, 2002). At the same time, however, policy and cultural differences\nin gender equity also exist, which should predict some variation in equity\neffects on fertility across the two countries. A comparison of the institutional\nfactors affecting the family\u2019s division of labour and fertility in Italy and Spain\nare described next. Given the data window of the ECHP, the focus will be on the\nsociopolitical contexts in the second half of the twenty-first century.\nItaly and Spain\nGender equity in employment\nBetween 1945 and 1975, southern Europe experienced a remarkable expansion\nof industrial sector employment, but the supply of these jobs remained lower than\nin northern European countries (Ferrera, 2005). During this period, Italy and\nSpain put in place highly protective employment policies for people working in\nthe public sector and large industrial enterprises, creating a segmented labour\nmarket in terms of job security and working conditions. Rigid hiring and\ntermination rules, job stability and good wages tied to seniority characterised\nthe core employment sector. In contrast, flexible entry and exit rules, job\ninstability and greater wage inequality characterised the peripheral sector (for\nexample, small enterprises, building sector and so on). A substantial informal\nblack market exists as well, estimated to produce between 15 and 30 per cent of\ntotal gross domestic product in these countries (Ferrera, 2005). The polarisation\namong workers sharpens the insider\/outsider distinction in southern Europe as\ncompared with northern corporatist-conservative states. The distinction is also\ngendered, in that the micro-solidarity of extended family defining Mediterranean\nsocial life relies heavily on women\u2019s unpaid care work. When women seek work,\nthey are more likely than men to find it in peripheral or black market sectors\n(Barbera and Vettor, 2001).\nThe 1973\u201374 oil crises resulted in a rapid rise in inflation and job\nprecariousness. By the mid-1980s, unemployment was above 8 per cent in\nall four Mediterranean countries, highest in Spain at 20 per cent and most\nacute among young people. More than one-third of Italian and almost half\nof Spanish youth were unemployed during the latter part of the 1980s, figures\n6 lynn prince cooke\nthat did not change very much through the 1990s (Bernardi and Nazio, 2005;\nNoguera et al., 2005). Under the high levels of unemployment, labour unions\nincreasingly defended existing employees\u2019 rights, so deregulation efforts to boost\nemployment apply mainly to new labour market entrants (Bernardi and Nazio,\n2005). Temporary contracts were introduced, with young persons often offered\na series of these rather than permanent employment (de la Rica and Iza, 2003;\nEscobedo, 2001). This deepens the insider\u2013outsider labour markets favouring\nolder males, extending the time young persons depend on and reside with their\nparents and delaying the onset of marriage and childbearing (Bernardi and Nazio,\n2005; de la Rica and Iza, 2003; Kohler et al., 2002). Consequently, there is a marked\ngenerational and gender dimension to the insider\/outsider cleavage in southern\nEurope that affects gender equity as well as the ability to form new families. Policy\nreinforcement of these differentials, however, varies across the countries.\nIn Italy, the principles of equal pay and treatment of women and men in\nemployment were part of the 1948 Constitution, although the Constitution also\ndefined women in terms of their \u2018essential\u2019 family role. Until the late 1970s, Italian\nwelfare state debates contained a simultaneous discourse of gender difference and\nequality, supported by the unusual bedfellows of left-wing political parties and\nCatholic cultural traditions (Barbera and Vettor, 2001). Until the 1950s, women\nwere legally barred from the best jobs and higher employment ranks and could\nbe fired once they married or became pregnant (Saraceno, 1994).\nIn 1961, explicit gender discrimination in the labour market was banned,\nincluding the trade union practice of classifying women\u2019s and men\u2019s work\nseparately in collective bargaining agreements (Barbera and Vettor, 2001). Even\ngreater equity gains for women were won in the 1960s when the trade union\norganisations adopted the egalitarian principle of equal pay to protect the less\nskilled and lower paid workers, categories over-represented by women. As a result,\nItalian gender wage differentials by the end of the 1990s were among the lowest in\nEurope. Italian women without upper secondary qualifications averaged just 69\nper cent of the earnings of men with similar education, but this was higher than\nthe OECD average of 60 per cent (OECD, 2004). Among all full-time workers,\nthe 1999 ratio of women\u2019s to men\u2019s median earnings was 91 per cent, similar to\nAustralia and Sweden (OECD, 2002). In contrast to these latter two countries,\nhowever, Italian occupational gender segregation was also among the lowest\nin OECD countries and women\u2019s full-time employment more prevalent than\npart-time (OECD, 2002).\nItalian women\u2019s rather striking wage and occupational sector equity exists\nagainst the backdrop of low female labour force participation. In 2000, Italy\u2019s\nfemale employment rate was just 47per cent, as compared with the OECD average\nof 67 per cent. In contrast to women in Australia, Britain and Germany, Italian\nwomen seldom work part-time: 71 per cent of Italian dual-earner couples with\nsmall children both work full-time, as compared with an average of 67 per cent\ngender equity and fertility in italy and spain 7\nacross the original 12 European Union member states (Franco and Winqvist,\n2002).\nIn Spain, the stringent reinforcement of gender inequality under Franco\npersisted until his death in the 1970s. The 1938 Fuero del Trabajo legal statement\non work aimed to exclude married women from the labour market. The Fuero\nde los Espanoles in 1945 revoked the Republican legislation on civil matrimony\nand divorce, instead claiming the indissolubility of marriage and reinstating the\n1889 Civil Code confirming male authority (Nash, 1991). The family allowances\nand bonuses introduced in 1938 and 1945, respectively, were construed as wage\nsupplements and paid directly to a male breadwinner. All workers had a right\nto family allowances, with the exception of workers engaged in either home\nwork or domestic services, those occupations dominated by women (Nash,\n1991).\nThe employment security provided under Franco\u2019s economic system\nexcluded women from the workforce, with the assumption of female unpaid\ncare embedded in social regulations and function of main public services such as\nhealth, schools and so on. (Escobedo, 2001; Noguera et al., 2005). Because of this\ninstitutional reinforcement of women\u2019s responsibility for the domestic sphere,\nSpain had one of the largest gender employment gaps among persons aged 15\u221264\n(OECD, 2002). Despite rhetorical compliance with European Union gender\nmainstreaming objectives, disparities persisted. Collective bargaining agreements\nthrough the 1990s contained gender biases such as male and female categories\nfor the same work, and women remained over-represented in low wage sectors\n(Caprile and Escobedo, 2003). The Spanish gender employment gap as of 2000\nwas 33 percentage points, the largest of the OECD countries except for Mexico\n(OECD, 2004). As in Italy, however, married women\u2019s employment tended to be\nfull-time: as of the late 1990s, 83 per cent of couples in Spain reported that both\nadults in dual-earner households worked full-time, versus a 67 per cent average\nacross the original 12 European Union member states (Franco and Winqvist,\n2002). Yet in 1995, the gender pay gap among full-time Spanish workers was\nalmost 28 per cent, among the highest wage gaps in the OECD (Caprile and\nEscobedo, 2003).\nGender equity in the family\nItalian and Spanish women\u2019s lower labour force participation stems in large\npart from the difficulty in balancing work and family under the extended kinship\nmodel that relies on women\u2019s unpaid care work. There is little public provision of\nchildcare for children under the age of three, although it is extensively available\nin both countries once children reach that age (OECD, 2001, 2004). Sources of\nprivate care are also underdeveloped. As of the late 1990s, only 6 per cent of Italian\nchildren and 5 per cent of Spanish children under the age of three were in either\npublic or private formal care (OECD, 2001). The lack of childcare encourages\n8 lynn prince cooke\nemployed women to delay childbirth, which has negative effects on the ability to\nachieve larger family sizes (Kohler et al., 2002).\nThis lack of formal care options leads to Italian and Spanish women relying\non familial networks, particularly female relatives of the mother\u2019s family, to\nprovide care (Caprile and Escobedo, 2003; Jurado Guerrero and Naldini, 1996;\nTobio, 2001). At the same time, any older relatives requiring care are also expected\nto find it first within the family. Care is distinctly feminine in the Mediterranean:\nItalian fathers as of the 1980s spent among the least amount of time in childcare\nthan fathers in other countries (Gershuny, 2000), and time use studies conducted\nin 1996 reveal a similar situation in Spain (Escobedo, 2001).\nBecause of the labour market situation, other family-flexibility options are\nnot taken. For example, maternity policies through the 1990s were fairly generous\nin both countries. As of 1999, Italian mothers were entitled to a maximum of 65\nweeks of maternity leave, 30 weeks of which were paid; Spanish mothers were\nentitled to 164, but only 16 of which were paid (Jaumotte, 2003: 31). Taking\nextended leave in a market with high unemployment, however, puts the quality\nof future full-time employment at risk. So although take-up of maternity leave\nin the public sector as of the late 1990s was universal, it was lower among women\nworking in the private sector or with temporary contracts (Escobedo, 2001;\nEuropean Commission, 1998). Yet the small Italian and Spanish welfare states\nmean there are fewer public sector employment opportunities as compared with\nnorthern European countries (Adsera, 2003). So despite Italian women\u2019s slight\nequity advantage in employment during the 1990s, institutional support for\ngreater equity in the home and care work appears more similar across the two\ncountries. We next assess the extent to which these differences in aggregate equity\nresult in differing effects of some measures of individual-level equity on the\nlikelihood of second births during the 1990s.\nMethod\nData and analytic technique\nA woman\u2019s work hours and the likelihood of having a child vary across her life\ncourse, making event history analysis of longitudinal data the most suitable way\nto assess these dynamic relationships (Allison, 1984). Waves 1 through 7 (1994 to\n2000) of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) are used to analyse\nthe likelihood of second births within married person households in Italy and\nSpain. Despite the limited time frame, the advantage of using the ECHP over more\ndetailed national datasets is that the data are comparable across the countries.\nThe advantages of the ECHP over the United Nations Family and Fertility Surveys\nare that the data are gathered annually rather than retrospectively, and the ECHP\ncontains more information on couples\u2019 care responsibilities and options, income,\neducation, employment characteristics and other factors to be explored in the\ncontext of gender equity effects on fertility.\ngender equity and fertility in italy and spain 9\nIn the first wave, 1994, approximately 130,000 adults aged 16 years and over\nwere interviewed in the 12 European Union Member states. Overall, 83 per cent\nof original sample households have been retained between 1995 and 1999, the last\nyear for which such statistics are available. From Wave 1, all married persons in\nItaly and Spain where the woman is less than 43 years of age and the couples have\none child are selected and followed through the 2000 wave or attrition from the\npanel. This yields a sample of 582 Italian and 504 Spanish couples. A separate\nobservational record is created for each year a couple is in the data set prior to\na second birth, yielding a total analytic sample of 2,439 Spanish and 2,781 Italian\ncouple-years, reduced to 1,396 in Spain and 1,983 in Italy after listwise deletion of\nmissing data, caused by absence of data for a given year for couples. Analyses of\nmissing data effects indicate no significant differences in results presented here.\nRobust standard errors clustering on a unique couple identification number\nare used to control for the correlation in the error terms stemming from using\nmultiple yearly observations for each couple.\nDependent variable\nThe dependent variable is an indicator variable for whether a second birth\noccurs in a given year (0 = no; 1 = yes). Once the second birth occurs, couples\nare dropped from the analysis. During the panel, 218 Italian and 179 Spanish\ncouples had a second child. The likelihood of second rather than first birth is\nchosen because although the likelihood of any birth has declined somewhat across\nOECD countries, the most dramatic drop affecting the fertility rate is the much\nlower likelihood of second and subsequent births (Kohler et al., 2002; Sleebos,\n2003). In addition, the only domestic time measures in the European Community\nHousehold Panel are hours in childcare, which are applicable only after a couple\nhas at least one child. The likelihood of a second birth is modelled with variables\nmeasuring some elements of individual-level gender equity, along with control\nvariables.\nGender equity variables\nThe standardisation of the questionnaires in the European Community\nHousehold Panel allows for identical variable construction for Italy and Spain.\nEducation is measured with three indicator variables: one when the wife has\nless than secondary schooling, one each when she or her husband has tertiary\neducation. The referent is secondary education. Gender equity in employment\nis captured with one variable indicating a wife\u2019s weekly employment hours\nand another for her labour earnings as a percentage of total household labour\nearnings. The model was also run using a woman\u2019s hourly wages instead of her\nrelative earnings, but the latter proved a slightly better fit. A third variable is an\nindicator for when the wife is employed in the public sector, which might provide\n10 lynn prince cooke\ngreater job flexibility or security that enables women to better balance work and\nfamily demands (Adsera, 2003).\nMeasures of gender equity within the family include care work available\nfrom others as well as the division of care between mothers and fathers. One\nfamily care strategy common in the Mediterranean is to rely on other adults,\neither paid domestic servants or relatives, so an indicator variable is included for\nwhen a third adult resides in the household. This does not, however, control for\ncare provided by relatives living outside of the household. An indicator variable\nis included for those families paying for childcare, against a referent of those who\ndo not. Because the availability of childcare is most important for dual-earner\ncouples, an interaction term is created indicating when the wife is employed and\nthe couple pays for childcare. Couples increasingly find themselves sandwiched\nbetween care demands from children as well as ageing relatives. To control for\nthe latter, an indicator variable is included for when wives spend time each week\ncaring for an adult.\nTo assess equity in the division of care between husbands and wives, three\nmeasures are created. The first is a percentage indicating father\u2019s share of the total\ncouple time spent in childcare. Within the countries\u2019 institutional environments\nlacking both public and private support for maternal employment, fathers\u2019 share\nshould be more important for working mothers, so an interaction term is\ncreated for fathers\u2019 share of childcare when mothers are employed. This same\ninstitutional reinforcement of women\u2019s care responsibilities, however, suggests\nthat any positive effect of fathers\u2019 share of care might not be linear: it might be\ndetrimental at some point as his share continues to increase. This dynamic would\nbe evident if the square of his percentage share of childcare is negative, so the\nsquare is included here.\nControls include mother\u2019s age at first birth, years since first birth, total\nhousehold income and its square, and time in the panel. The two household\nincome measures were selected to best capture the competing income effects of\n\u2018costly\u2019 (positive effect of household income) versus \u2018quality\u2019 (negative effect of\nhousehold income squared) children.\nResults\nAs evident in the descriptive statistics presented in Table 1, although almost half\nthe women in both countries have only secondary schooling or less, similar\nproportions of women and men in both countries have tertiary education. Twice\nas many Spanish women and men have some tertiary education as compared\nwith Italian men and women. These results are consistent with aggregate data on\neducational attainment in the two countries (OECD, 2004).\nDespite this evidence of education equity, gender equity in employment is\nlow but slightly greater in Italy than Spain, with wives\u2019 average weekly work hours\ngender equity and fertility in italy and spain 11\nTABLE 1.

These numbers result from the large share of wives in\nboth countries who are out of the labour force: 44 per cent of Italian and 57 per\ncent of Spanish wives are not employed at some time during the panel. Wives\nwho are employed tend to work full-time, with Spanish women working slightly\nmore hours than Italian women (37 versus 34 hours, respectively). Working wives\ncontribute almost half of the household income. That a larger proportion of\nItalian wives are employed and contribute a slightly larger share to their family\u2019s\nincome despite working fewer weekly hours is evidence of slightly greater gender\nemployment equity in Italy than in Spain during this time period.\nGender equity pertaining to the family is also low in both countries. A small\npercentage of wives spend some time each week caring for an elderly person,\nalthough almost three times as many Italian wives report doing so (8 per cent\nas compared with 3 per cent among Spanish wives). Only 7 per cent of Italian\nand 4 per cent of Spanish couples with a child are dual-earners who pay for\nchildcare. Husbands\u2019 share of childcare is modest: 15 per cent in Italy and 11 per\ncent in Spain. These percentages do not alter much when wives are employed,\nwith fathers in both countries then contributing just 19 per cent.\n12 lynn prince cooke\nTABLE 2.

In both Italy and Spain, each hour increase in a wife\u2019s\nemployment significantly decreases the likelihood of second birth, although the\neffect in Italy is 50 per cent larger than in Spain (log-odds of \u20130.03 versus\n\u20130.02). When a wife works full-time, these effects indicate that the likelihood\nof second birth is reduced by 120 per cent in Italy and 80 per cent in Spain. On\nthe other hand, her relative earnings prove insignificant, so it is not her financial\nopportunity cost but time availability that decreases the likelihood of having\nmore children. The overall child cost-versus-quality trade-off is only evident in\nSpain, where greater household income increases the likelihood of a second birth,\nwhile its square decreases the likelihood.\nAlthough very few couples have another adult in the household, this person\u2019s\npresence greatly increases the likelihood of having a second child, but the effect\nonly reaches statistical significance in Italy.

Women\u2019s care responsibilities\nfor another adult slightly reduce the odds of having a second child, but the effect\nis not significant in either country.\nFathers\u2019 share of childcare has no effect on the likelihood of a second birth\nin Spain. In Italy, however, the magnitude of the effect countervails the negative\neffect of Italian mothers\u2019 work hours. Each additional percentage point share\nan Italian father contributes to childcare increases the odds of second birth by\n5 per cent. When the mother is employed, his greater share further increases the\nodds by 2 per cent, although this latter effect is just marginally significant. The\nsquared term is also significant, supporting that the effect of fathers\u2019 share of care\nis curvilinear. As plotted in Figure 1 using predicted probabilities, the effects of\nfather\u2019s relative time in childcare on the likelihood the couple will have a second\nchild vary depending on mother\u2019s employment intensity. When mothers are out\nof the labour force, men\u2019s relative childcare increases the likelihood until his\nshare exceeds about one-quarter, after which the likelihood of having a second\nchild declines sharply. When mothers are employed part-time, they are less likely\nthan stay-at-home mothers to have a second child until fathers\u2019 share exceeds\n14 lynn prince cooke\n30 per cent, at which point the plotted lines cross. When a mother works full-\ntime, her relative odds of having a second child are lower than for other mothers\nuntil father\u2019s childcare share exceeds 60 per cent, at which point the log-odds are\nslightly higher than for stay-at-home mothers. But at this care division, all Italian\ncouples are so unlikely to have a second child that this small victory for more\nnon-traditional gender roles among employed mothers seems rather hollow.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nA growing body of evidence indicates that gender equity varies in context,\nwith more egalitarian divisions of domestic tasks observed in countries with\ngreater policy support for gender equity (Breen and Cooke, 2005; Cooke, 2007b;\nStier and Lewin-Epstein, 2007). Effects of gender equity on fertility also vary in\ncontext, with higher fertility associated with more egalitarian domestic divisions\nin countries such as Sweden where policies support maternal employment (Ola\u00b4h,\n2003) or remain silent regarding the domestic sphere such as in the United\nStates (Torr and Short, 2004). In contrast, a gendered division of labour predicts\nhigher fertility in countries with historical support for male breadwinner families\nsuch as the former West Germany (Cooke, 2004). Here we use the European\nCommunity Household Panel to assess whether differences in equity effects on\nfertility are evident across two countries with similar institutional reliance on\nextended kinship networks and women\u2019s unpaid care work, but distinct, albeit\nsmall, differences in gender employment equity during the 1990s.\nGender equity in employment is low in both Italy and Spain, with about half\nof the wives with one child out of the labour force at some time during the seven\nyears of the panel. Wives who were employed tended to work full-time, with the\ngender earnings gap smaller in Italy than in Spain. Wives\u2019 hours of work in both\ncountries reduced the likelihood of a second birth, with the effect more acute in\nItaly. The presence of another adult in the household increased the likelihood of\nhaving a second child, although the effect only reached statistical significance in\nItaly. Dual-earner couples that paid for childcare were more likely to have another\nchild, with the net effect appreciably greater in Spain than in Italy. Both of these\nsources of care were available to just a small number of couples in the countries,\nso an obvious policy solution to the low fertility in the two countries would be\nto expand infant childcare availability. The macro-economic factors that blunted\nemployment, however, also reduced available tax dollars or disposable income for\nsuch public or private investment. So, ironically, the same contextual factors that\nundermined a male breadwinner model also prevented the alteration of it. Since\nthe 1990s, childcare availability has been expanding, but primarily for children\naged three to five (Leo\u00b4n, 2007).\nDespite the limited external care options, however, only in Italy did fathers\u2019\nassumption of more caring responsibilities significantly increase the likelihood\ngender equity and fertility in italy and spain 15\nof a couple having another child, particularly within dual-earner couples. The\nmagnitude of the effect was five times that found by Cooke (2004) in her analysis\nof German couples. Yet when Italian fathers assumed more than one-quarter to\none-third of childcare, the likelihood began to decline sharply. These findings\nsuggest, first, that women\u2019s greater aggregate employment equity predicts not\nonly modestly greater equity within households, but positive effects of equity on\nfamily outcomes. Consequently, although we have not realised the revolution in\ngender roles predicted by women\u2019s rising labour force participation, the evidence\nhere suggests the evolution helps couples meet productive and reproductive\nchallenges in post-industrial societies.\nWhen Italian couples venture too far from traditional domestic roles,\nhowever, the likelihood of second birth declines sharply. Whether this reflects\n\u2018maternal gatekeeping\u2019 on the part of Italian mothers or Italian fathers\u2019 resistance\nto assuming more of the care tasks cannot be assessed with these data. Maternal\ngatekeeping is a term used by Allen and Hawkins (1999) referring to working US\nmothers who actively managed fathers\u2019 access to children. In a more recent\nanalysis, Sayer (2005) found that although US women still retain primary\nresponsibility for childcare, US men\u2019s childcare hours have also increased since\nthe 1960s, and they have taken on a significantly larger share of housework. The\nECHP has no measures of housework with which to compare whether Italian\nor Spanish men are similarly performing more housework as compared with\nchildcare. More qualitative cross-country comparisons are needed to unravel\nwho in the family actively structures the household division of domestic labour.\nOn the other hand, no paternal care effects were found for Spanish couples.\nThis might result from the lower levels of gender equity in employment in Spain\nas compared with Italy. More Spanish wives were out of the labour force and the\ngender wage gap is among the largest in OECD countries. To the extent aggregate\ngender equity in employment results in women\u2019s greater ability to negotiate more\negalitarian divisions of domestic tasks as argued by Breen and Cooke (2005), this\nability is lower in Spain than in Italy. The findings here support the growing\nbody of evidence that policy support for greater gender equity in the public\nsphere leads to greater gender equity within the domestic sphere, which in turn\ncountervails some of the negative fertility effect associated with women\u2019s labour\nforce participation (Cooke, 2004; Ola\u00b4h, 2003; Torr and Short, 2004).\nThere are limitations to the study. First, defining childcare remains\nchallenging. Is time spent playing with a child considered care, or is it equivalent\nto tending a sick child in the middle of the night? Australian time diary data\nreveal that mothers are far more likely to be home alone with their children\nand responsible for their physical care, whereas Australian fathers spend more\ntime with their children in play (Craig, 2003). If this is the case, increases in\npaternal time may not be reducing mothers\u2019 time in care, although undoubtedly\nchildren benefit from this extra parental time. Second, the ECHP limits analyses\n16 lynn prince cooke\nto the 1990s, so we are unable to see effects of policy changes since that time. As\nnoted above, childcare is expanding in Spain, and more recent employment data\nsuggest gender equity in that sphere is more similar now across the two countries\n(OECD, 2007). Future research will need to assess whether these policy changes\nhave shifted the effects of individual equity factors on fertility within Italy and\nSpain.\nDespite the limitations, the findings reported here support that a gendered\ndivision of labour appears increasingly inflexible and detrimental to modern\nfamilies. It exacerbates the historical negative relationship between women\u2019s\nemployment and fertility during a time when women\u2019s earnings are crucial\nto family economic flexibility. The findings also underscore the importance of\nfathers\u2019 childcare participation even in cultures with strong reinforcement of\nwomen\u2019s responsibility for care work. Finally, the results highlight the importance\nof assessing gender equity writ large, in terms of employment opportunities,\nstructures and the variety of care solutions families use to fashion solutions for\nbalancing work and family in post-industrial societies.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded by a grant from the European Commission and the Ministry for\nCulture, Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg under the Transnational Access\nto Major Research Infrastructures, contract HPRI-CT-2001-00128, hosted by IRISS-C\/I at\nCEPS\/INSTEAD, Differdange, Luxembourg.
