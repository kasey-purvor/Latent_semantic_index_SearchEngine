Introduction 24 \nAs a natural component of the atmosphere, ammonia (NH3) plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry and 25 \nambient aerosol formation. Its emission rapidly increased during the 20th century due to the doubled or even 26 \ntripled intensification of agricultural production (Galloway et al., 2004; 2008; Erisman et al., 2008). Ammonia is a 27 \nmajor atmospheric pollutant, contributing to eutrophication, acidification and loss of biodiversity (Pearson and 28 \nStewart, 1993; Fangmeier et al., 1994; Krupa, 2003). Most emitted reactive nitrogen (N) will be deposited back on 29 \nland (Goulding et al., 1998), even more so for NH3 because of its short-distance transport (Asman et al., 1998). 30 \n This process, called \u2018N deposition\u2019, fertilizes ecosystems, influences the N cycle and introduces N saturation 31 \n(Aber et al., 1989; Matson et al., 2002; Adams, 2003). Increased N availability in ecosystems can lead to rapid 32 \ndecline in species richness, even at the current N deposition level (Sala et al., 2000; Gotelli and Ellison, 2002; 33 \nStevens et al., 2004). In addition, NH3 is a key precursor to neutralize H2SO4 and HNO3 in the air and form 34 \n(NH4)2SO4, NH4HSO4 and NH4NO3 (Pinder and Adams, 2007; Erisman and Schaap, 2004; Walker et al., 2004; 35 \nOlszyan et al., 2005), which contribute to reduced visibility, regional haze and health impacts associated with fine 36 \nparticular matter (PM).  37 \n 38 \nBouwman et al. (1997) estimated that the global NH3 emission was about 54 Tg in 1990, half of which had been 39 \nestimated to derive from Asia. In the total global NH3 emission, 70% is estimated to be related to food production, 40 \nand the other 30% is estimated to be related to natural sources, industrial processes, fossil fuels, etc. (Bouwman, et 41 \nal., 1997; Olivier et al., 1998). A host of evidence shows that agricultural sources, i.e. volatilization from livestock 42 \nmanures and mineral fertilizer application, contribute to the major part of NH3 emissions, approximately 80-90% 43 \nof the total anthropogenic emission (Bouwman et al., 1997; Asman et al., 1998; Van Der Hoek, 1998; Battye et 44 \nal., 2003).    45 \n 46 \nCurrent researches on ammonia emissions inventories at large scales, such as global, Asian and national 47 \ninventories, reveal that approximate 20% of global NH3 emission comes from China (Zhao and Wang, 1994; 48 \nKilmont et al., 2001; Yamaji et al., 2004), especially from the intensive agricultural area (Yan et al., 2003; Wang 49 \net al., 2005). To feed 22% of the global population on 9% of the world\u2019s arable land, China consumed more than 50 \n30% of the world\u2019s total N fertilizer in the last decade (http:\/\/www.stats.gov.cn\/; IFA). Moreover, intensive 51 \nlivestock husbandry has greatly developed in China due to the increasing requirement for livestock products. In 52 \n2006, China\u2019s annual production of meat, eggs and milk were 80.5, 29.5 and 33.0 Mt, respectively, an increase of 53 \n4.2, 5.5 and 11.4 times those in the early 1980s, respectively (http:\/\/www.stats.gov.cn\/) (Fig.1a). There was nearly 54 \nno change for the  expenditure on grain and eggs, while the expenditure on meat and milk were 1.3 and 4.8 times 55 \nthat in the previous decade, respectively (Fig. 1b). Meeting this demand was associated with a sharp increase in 56 \nthe use of mineral nitrogen fertilizers and intensive livestock production. This, in turn, has led to the growth of 57 \nNH3 emissions in China in the last decade. 58 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            59 \nThe North China Plain (NCP) (Fig. 2a), which is called \u201cChina\u2019s granary\u201d, provides 40% and 25% of China\u2019s 60 \n wheat and corn production on 3.3% of the national area. Application rates of mineral nitrogen fertilizers in the 61 \nNCP are up to 600 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (Zhao et al., 1997; Cui, 2005). Less than 30% efficiency in N application 62 \nintroduces about 40% N loss by various routes, including leaching of nitrate (NO3-) and emissions of NH3, nitrous 63 \noxide (N2O) and molecular nitrogen (N2). In addition, about 30% of national animal products are also from this 64 \narea, which further increases the ammonia emission. Significantly high N deposition has been found in this area: 65 \n27 kg N ha-1 yr-1 deposited in inorganic forms, with 67% in the form of ammonium (Zhang et al., 2008a) , and 9 66 \nkg N ha-1 yr-1 in organic forms (Zhang et al., 2008b) from bulk deposition; 55 kg N ha-1 yr-1 derived from dry 67 \ndeposition (Shen, in press); He et al. (2007) estimated the airborne N input up to 80-90 kg ha-1 yr-1 across the NCP 68 \nusing 15N dilution method. All of this evidence supports the potential intensive NH3 emission in the NCP.  69 \n 70 \nIn this study, estimated NH3 emissions in the NCP were calculated at a 5 \u00d75 km grid resolution based on a 71 \nChinese national land use database (1 \u00d7 1 km grid resolution). Ammonia emissions from livestock farms were 72 \ncalculated using the agricultural model of RAINS (Klimont and Brink, 2004); emissions from mineral fertilizer 73 \napplication were estimated from earlier measurements. This work represents the first estimate of NH3 emissions in 74 \nChina at high spatial resolution. In spite of some uncertainties, these data form the essential input for calculations 75 \nwith an atmospheric transport model (ATM) to estimate atmospheric concentrations of NH3 and deposition of N, 76 \nwhich can be applied to estimate exceedances of critical loads and levels and for testing the efficiency of future 77 \nammonia emissions abatement strategies. 78 \n  79 \n2. Methodology  80 \n2.1 Database  81 \nData for the year 2004 were used for both the fertilizer use and livestock populations. Primary census databases at 82 \nprefecture level were obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook (http:\/\/www.stats.gov.cn\/), the Beijing 83 \nStatistical Yearbook (http:\/\/www.bjstats.gov.cn\/), the Tianjin Statistical Yearbook (http:\/\/www.stats-tj.gov.cn\/), 84 \nthe Hebei Statistical Yearbook (http:\/\/www.hetj.gov.cn\/), the Henan Statistical Yearbook 85 \n(http:\/\/www.ha.stats.gov.cn\/), the Shandong Statistical Yearbook (http:\/\/www.stats-sd.gov.cn\/), the Anhui 86 \nStatistical Yearbook (http:\/\/www.ahtjj.gov.cn\/) and the Jiangsu Statistical Yearbook (http:\/\/www.jssb.gov.cn\/). 87 \nThe geographical database used in this study was published by the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural 88 \nResources Research, Chinese Academy of Science. It included the information of administration area and land use 89 \narea, which covers arable land, forest, grass land, urban and industrial land etc., comprising 18 land types on a 1 \u00d7 90 \n 1 km latitude-longitude grid. Five provinces (Hebei, Henan, Shangdong, Jiangsu and Anhui) and two 91 \nmunicipalities (Beijing and Tianjin) (Fig. 2a) (Table 1), including fifty-three prefectures (Fig. 2b) were covered in 92 \nthe study area. The average area of the prefectures is 8,452 km2, with the minimum value of 2,153 km2 for the 93 \nHebi prefecture in the Henan province and maximum value of 14,132 km2 for the Cangzhou prefecture in the 94 \nHebei province (prefectures with only a part of their area in the NCP were not included). 95 \n 96 \n2.2 Emission factors 97 \nAlthough a number of studies have been undertaken on NH3 emission inventories as well as the emission factors 98 \n(e.g. Klaassen, 1992, Bouwman et al., 1997, Misselbrook et al., 2000, Klimont,  2001, Doorn et al., 2002),  99 \nmeasured emission factors for different sources specific to China do not yet exist. Emission factors for livestock 100 \n(including poultry) used in European countries are summarized in Table 2. Many factors affect ammonia 101 \nproduction, such as species, gender, age, body weight, N content of the feed, the conversion of N in feed to N in 102 \nmeat, milk and eggs, housing systems, litter\/manure storage, spreading technique, proportion of time spent by 103 \nlivestock indoor and outside and climatic conditions (EEA, 2007). Bouwman et al. (1997) calculated NH3 104 \nemission factors for livestock excretion for developing countries with the assumption of lower feeding levels, 105 \nlower N content of the feed, a small portion of the livestock housed in stables and a higher temperature in the 106 \ndeveloping areas. Klimont (2001) adjusted the emission factors for Chinese specific production efficiency of milk 107 \nor meat. Here, we re-calculated emission factors using the RAINS model methodology (Klimont and Brink, 2004) 108 \nbut considering specific Chinese factors in the calculation: 109 \n                              ef1 = Nx1 * v1 110 \n                              ef2 = Nx1 * (1 - v1) * v2 111 \n                              ef3 = Nx1 * (1 - v1 \u2013 (1 - v1) * v2) * v3 112 \n                              ef4 = Nx4 * v4 113 \n                                            EF = ef1 + ef2 + ef3 + ef4                                                                          114 \nWhere, ef1,2,3,4 are NH3-N loss at distinct emission stages, i.e., housing (1), storage (2), spreading (3), and grazing 115 \n(4); Nx1,4 are N excretion during housing (1) and grazing (4); v1,2,3,4 are NH3-N volatilization rates at distinct 116 \nemission stages; EF is the final emission factor. Livestock management specific to the Chinese situation was 117 \nconsidered in the study, such as the household scale and industrial scale, housing system, manure storage, as well 118 \nas the differences in different provinces.  119 \n 120 \n Taking the emission factor for chicken as an example, all the parameters required in the RAINS model are listed 121 \nin Table 3. The NH3-N loss rates at different stages were combinations of the parameters from references (Asman, 122 \n1992, ECETOC, 1994, Hutchings et al., 2001, EEA, 2007a) and the specific Chinese livestock management 123 \nsystems. In the traditional households, chicken are free-range. NH3-N loss rates are very high at the housing stage. 124 \nThe main storage method, composting of the manure, increases ammonia emission as well. However, in the 125 \nintensive chicken farms, laying hens are caged, which gives a low NH3-N loss rate in the housing stage. 126 \nAnaerobic digestion is the main storage method for the manure of laying hens in intensive farms, which greatly 127 \nreduces the ammonia emission. Broilers in intensive farms are kept with bedding material on the floor. For short 128 \nproduction cycles, usually 55 days, manure is not treated during the whole period. Bedding material is cleaned 129 \nonce a production cycle finished. So, housing and storage processes are mixed for the broilers in intensive farms. 130 \nFor manure from both the traditional households and intensive farms, 3.5% and 5% NH3-N are lost in the spring 131 \nand early autumn spreading stages, respectively. There is no grazing stage for chicken, and the loss rates at this 132 \nstage were set to zero. Finally, the traditional household management systems introduced much higher emission 133 \nfactors than the intensive farm management systems. In intensive chicken farms, the emission factors for broilers 134 \nwere comparable with the data cited from the reference (Table 2), while the emission factors for laying hens are 135 \nlower than those for the caged housing stage.  136 \n 137 \nEmission factors for all the other livestock sources from different provinces in the NCP were calculated by the 138 \nsame methodology and are listed in Table 4.  139 \n 140 \nAmmonia emission from mineral fertilizer application is another important part of the agricultural sources. In 141 \nChina, the widely used N fertilizers are ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) and urea. Based on EEA (2007b) and 142 \nECETOC (1994), the NH3-N loss rate of urea is 15%.  There has been no research on the emission factor for ABC 143 \nbecause of its small usage elsewhere. Bouwman et al. (1997) specially developed estimates of NH3 loss from the 144 \napplication of ABC, which were up to 20-30%. The emission factors of both these fertilizers are higher than for 145 \nother N fertilizers, e.g. ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, calcium ammonium nitrate, anhydrous ammonia 146 \nand so on. Cai et al. (2002) measured ammonia loss in the NCP in different cropping systems: 30-39% of N 147 \napplied to rice, 11-48% of N applied to maize and 1-20% of N applied to wheat was lost as ammonia. Ding (2005) 148 \nmeasured ammonia emissions in winter wheat-summer maize rotation systems in Beijing, typical of agricultural 149 \nareas in the north part of the NCP, and found that 19.4% and 25.8% of N fertilizer applied was lost as ammonia 150 \n for wheat and maize systems, respectively. Using a wind-tunnel system, Su (2006) found that NH3 volatilization 151 \nwas up to 21.2% NH3-N of urea-N within fifteen days after fertilization. Yan et al. (2003) estimated the emission 152 \nfrom fertilizer application in Asian countries: NH3-N losses of 23.5% and 13.7% were applied for urea in paddy 153 \nfields and uplands, respectively, while NH3-N losses of 34.5% and 20.5% applied for ABC in paddy fields and 154 \nuplands, respectively. Instead of re-calculating emission factors, we used measured results directly and without 155 \ndistinguishing differences among provinces for the smaller variation in fertilizer application practice in the NCP. 156 \nConsidering 40% urea, 50% ABC and 10% of compound or other fertilizer applied in the NCP, 22% and 30% 157 \nwere used as the fertilizer emission factors in northern wheat-maize rotation system and southern wheat-rice 158 \nrotation system in this study, respectively. 159 \n 160 \n2.3 Spatial allocation  161 \nAmmonia emission from each source was allocated into a 5-km grid resolution using the ratio of area with 162 \ndifferent land use for the different sources. By the bottom-up process, all the NH3 emissions from livestock and 163 \nfertilizer use were distributed into the whole NCP region by the proportion of crops, grasslands, forests and so on.  164 \n 165 \nA methodology similar to the AENEID model for obtaining the geographic distribution of ammonia emissions 166 \nfrom livestock and fertilizer application (Dragosits et al., 1998; Dragosits, 1999; Hellsten et al., 2008) was used in 167 \nthis study. The basic theory was to allocate all the livestock and fertilizer to the best suited land cover types. The 168 \noriginal NH3 emission source for each category was distributed onto the appropriate area based on the 169 \nmanagement type. Dragosits (1999) assigned the practices including housing, storage, spreading, grazing over 170 \ndifferent land cover types, and then allotted the NH3 emission from each source by the corresponding calculated 171 \nweighted indexes.  172 \n 173 \nUnlike in developed countries, livestock farms in the NCP operate at different scales, from household to 174 \nindustrial, and small farms are randomly scattered all over the place. It is difficult to calculate all the weighted 175 \nindexes in detail. However, arable land appears in 95% of the total area in the NCP, while forests and grasslands 176 \nonly appear in 8% and 6% of the total area in the NCP, respectively (Fig. 3). There are overlaps of different land 177 \nuses, such as agro-forestry and agro-pastoral ecosystems, as well as suburban areas with mixed properties of both 178 \nrural and urban areas. Moreover, except for a tiny number of livestock which are kept part time outdoors by 179 \nindividual farmers, most of the livestock are kept indoors throughout the year in the livestock farms (except sheep 180 \n and goats which are kept outdoors more time than other livestock). There is no NH3 emission from agricultural 181 \nsources considered in the forest and grassland areas excluding the grazing stage of cattle, sheep and goats, because 182 \nmost of the forest and grassland in the NCP are natural instead of semi-natural, as in developed countries. The 183 \nintensive management practices in the agricultural areas (mainly arable land) greatly simplify the allocation 184 \nprocess although some details are still missing. Ammonia emissions from housing and storage, spreading and 185 \ngrazing were allocated to probable rural residual areas, arable areas and grassland, respectively. The weighted 186 \nindex for each grid square was calculated by the percentage of the corresponding land uses. As for the mineral 187 \nfertilizer application, NH3 emission was allocated to the arable areas.  The N fertilizer use is never homogenous 188 \nbecause of the family operation on small plots, so an average value was applied. Although application of the same 189 \nemission factors for mineral fertilizer use will introduce larger uncertainties, it is still the most advisable way for 190 \nregional research at present. All emissions, independent of the management practices, were estimated within a 191 \nprefecture region and mapped onto a 1-km grid resolution by the land use at first. Considering the areas of the 192 \nprefectures in this study, 8,452 km2 on average, and reduction of uncertainties, the resulting map was aggregated 193 \nto a 5-km resolution.  194 \n 195 \n3. Results and Discussion 196 \n3.1 NH3 emission inventories 197 \nNH3 emissions from different sources in every prefecture in the NCP are listed in Table 5, based on the census 198 \ndatabase and emission factors. The total NH3 emission was as high as 3071 kt NH3-N yr-1 in the NCP in 2004, 199 \nincluding 1620 kt NH3-N yr-1 from mineral fertilizer application and 1451 kt NH3-N yr-1 from livestock sources. 200 \nIn all the livestock sources, 834 kt NH3-N yr-1 was from pig emission, taking the largest part; the following 223 kt 201 \nNH3-N yr-1 and 228 kt NH3-N yr-1 were from cattle and sheep (goats), respectively; and 166 kt NH3-N yr-1 was 202 \nfrom poultry.  203 \n 204 \nZhao and Wang (1994), Olivier et al. (1998) and Klimont (2001) estimated NH3-N emissions in China 205 \ncorresponding to 11.1, 8.4 and 7.9 Tg in 1990. Klimont (2001) estimated NH3-N emission in China to be 9.7 Tg in 206 \n1995. Streets et al. (2003) estimated NH3-N emission in China to be 11.2 Tg in 2000. Regardless of the temporal 207 \nvariation and other minor emission sources in the NCP, the agricultural sources in the NCP contributed 27% of 208 \nthe recent NH3 emission in China in 2000s. Comparing with the result from Hellsten et al., (2008), the total 209 \n ammonia emission in the NCP was 15 times that in the UK, while the area ratio of the NCP to the UK is only 1.3. 210 \nIt means that the ammonia emission density based on grid cell in the NCP is more than 10 times that in the UK. 211 \n 212 \nSun et al. (1997) estimated NH3 emission from the five provinces: Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu and Anhui, 213 \nand found 3.0 Tg NH3-N emitted in 1995. Wang et al. (2003) made the same estimation, and found 4.9 Tg NH3-N 214 \nemitted in 2000. Taking the area ratios (Hebei: 43%; Henan: 46%; Shandong: 40%; Jiangsu: 35%; Anhui: 27%) of 215 \nthe five provinces inside the NCP into account, it would give approximately 1.2 and 1.9 Tg NH3-N emissions for 216 \nthe areas in the NCP based on these two studies above, while our results gave 2.9 Tg NH3-N from the same area, 217 \nmuch higher than the former estimates. However, we cannot simply calculate emissions from the product of the 218 \nemission and the area ratio of every province, because it was assumed that the emissions were homogenously 219 \ndistributed in every province during the calculation. Actually, intensive agriculture is concentrated in the NCP 220 \ninstead of all the seven provinces (including the two municipalities, Beijing and Tianjin). The areas in these 221 \nprovinces but outside the NCP were usually forests and grasslands with less ammonia emissions, which can be 222 \nseen in the land use category maps in Fig. 3 and the subsequent spatial distribution section.   223 \n 224 \n3.2 Contributions of NH3 emission from different sources and provinces 225 \nContributions of NH3 emissions from different sources in the NCP and different provinces are shown in Fig. 4. 226 \nMineral fertilizer use contributed 54% to the total NH3 emission in the NCP, while livestock sources contributed 227 \nthe remaining 46% (Fig. 4a), consistent with the results for the whole national scale in former studies (Zhao and 228 \nWang, 1994; Kilmont 2001; Streets, et al., 2003). In the different provinces, ammonia emissions from mineral 229 \nfertilizer application accounted for 29%-81% to the total emissions (Fig. 4b-h), with lower ratio in the Tianjin 230 \nmunicipality and higher ratio in the Jiangsu province. Livestock emissions constituted emissions from cattle (7%), 231 \npigs (27%), sheep and goats (7%) and poultry (5%) (Fig. 4a). Pig emissions constituted the largest proportion of 232 \nthe livestock emissions, which is related to people\u2019s dietary habits. In the different provinces, the ratios ranged 233 \nfrom 14%-39% to the total emissions, with lower ratio in the Jiangsu province and higher ratio in the Shandong 234 \nprovince. Contributions of emissions from cattle, sheep and goats, and chicken varied in different provinces, 235 \nrelated to the different development strategies. Emissions from cattle now make a more significant contribution 236 \ndue to the sharply increased milk consumption in recent years (Fig. 1), although no temporal comparison was 237 \ncarried out here. 238 \n 239 \n Of the total agricultural emissions in the NCP, 23% derived from the Hebei province, 26% derived from the 240 \nHenan province, 26% from derived the Shandong province, 13% from derived the Jiangsu province, 8% derived 241 \nfrom the Anhui province and 4% derived from the Bejing and Tianjin municipalities together (Fig. 5a). The 242 \naveraged emission densities, emission per unit area, of the seven provinces are shown in Fig. 6, which reflects the 243 \ncontributions at relative areas of the seven different provinces. High emission density, more than 120 kg N ha-1 yr-244 \n1, was found in the Shandong province, while a low emission density, 40 kg N ha-1 yr-1, was found in the Beijing 245 \nmunicipality because, in Beijing, the large urban area with less NH3 emission shared the emissions, and gave a 246 \nlow emission density for the whole area. If only the rural area in Beijing was taken into account, the emission 247 \ndensities would have been as high as those in other areas, i.e. even more than 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (Fig. 7). 248 \n 249 \nContributions of the total livestock emission from different provinces were proportioned to the area percentages of 250 \neach province to the NCP (Fig. 5b; Table 1): the Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces took the larger part, 251 \nfollowed by the Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, then the Beijing and Tianjin municipalities. Among all livestock 252 \nsources, 223 kt yr-1 NH3-N was from cattle emission. All cattle, buffalos, dairy cattle, horses, donkeys, and camels 253 \nwere included in this part for the former category of draught cattle. Actually there are only a small number of 254 \nhorses, donkeys and camels in the NCP nowadays. 67% of the emission came from dairy cattle because of the 255 \nrapidly increased consumption of milk (Fig 1b). The Hebei province provided the largest part, 40% of the cattle 256 \nemission. Unlike the fraction of the total emission, there was only 2% cattle emission from the Jiangsu province 257 \n(Fig. 5c). Ammonia emission from pigs account for 27% of the total emission, more than half of all the livestock 258 \nemissions. The Shandong province provided the largest part of pig and poultry emission, 36% and 37% of the two 259 \nparts, respectively (Fig. 5 d & f). For the emission from sheep and goats, the three main provinces, Hebei, Henan 260 \nand Shandong still took the leading parts (Fig. 5g). The Tianjin municipality shared 9% and the Jiangsu province 261 \nshared only 3% of the emission, which was asymmetrical to the area percentages.  262 \n 263 \nAbout 1620 kt yr-1 NH3-N was emitted from mineral fertilizer application to arable land based on the census data 264 \nof N-fertilizer consumption and the emission factors. Emission from mineral fertilizer application constituted the 265 \nlargest proportion of the overall emission, contrasting with the ratios in developed countries which have more than 266 \n80% of emission from livestock husbandry (Sutton et al., 1995; Dragosits et al., 1998; Olivier et al., 1998; Battye 267 \net al., 2003). This illustrated the overall very high level of fertilizer application commonly used in Chinese 268 \nagriculture. Mineral fertilizer application in the Jiangsu province contributed 20% ammonia emission in this area 269 \n (Fig. 5h), twice as much as the other provinces considering the percentage of the area of the NCP. On the one 270 \nhand, paddy rice (or wheat-rice rotation system) is the main crop system in the southern the NCP, while winter 271 \nwheat-summer maize is the main crop rotation system in the north; on the other hand, the temperature in the south 272 \nis higher than in the north, which was a key factor for the NH3 emission from mineral fertilizer application (EEA, 273 \n2007).  274 \n 275 \n3.3 Spatial distribution 276 \nAccording to the estimation of NH3 emissions from each source (Table 4), the emission from every prefecture was 277 \ndistributed over land use by the bottom-up process (Fig. 7). Variations of livestock emissions were significant (Fig 278 \n6a-d) for the regional priority development strategies. High cattle emission was found in the Hebei and the Henan 279 \nprovinces, especially the Shijiazhuang and Hengshui prefectures in the Hebei province (Fig. 7a). High pig 280 \nemission was found in the Shandong province, especially the west part which was inside the NCP (Fig 6b). 281 \nAlthough the total contribution of sheep and goats emission was equal to the total contribution of cattle emission, 282 \nthe sheep and goats emission was more concentrated in the mid-south of the NCP, with a maximum of up to 31 kg 283 \nN ha-1 yr-1 (Fig. 7c). Poultry emissions were up 18 kg N ha-1 yr-1, and mainly concentrated in the mid-north of the 284 \nNCP (Fig. 7d). The highest livestock emission was 113 kg N ha-1 yr-1 at a 5\u00d75 km grid resolution, with high 285 \nvalues in the north of the Tianjin municipality, in the south of the Hebei province, in the west of the Shandong 286 \nprovince and the north of the Henan province (Fig. 7e). 287 \n 288 \nThe NH3 emission from mineral fertilizer use was high, up to 124 kg N ha-1 yr-1, which meant a great loss of N 289 \nresources to the environment. High emissions appeared in the Shandong province, in the Jiangsu province and in 290 \nsome parts of the Hebei and Henan provinces (Fig. 7f), consistent with the over-use of N fertilizer in these 291 \nintensive agricultural areas (Zhao et al., 1997; Cui, 2005). In contrast with the lower NH3 emissions from 292 \nlivestock husbandry in the Jiangsu province, it turned out to be higher in fertilizer use emission. The large amount 293 \nof N input, higher temperature and more precipitation in this area were all considered to be the main driving 294 \nfactors.  295 \n 296 \nThe total ammonia emission was as high as 198 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (Fig. 7g). High emissions were found in the middle 297 \nof the NCP. Low emissions were found in the north and west of the Hebei province and most of the Anhui 298 \nprovince, as well as individual emission sources in these two regions. It also gave a realistic explanation of the 299 \n much higher NH3 emission in the five main provinces in the NCP than the values simply calculated from the area 300 \nratio in section 3.1 above.  301 \n 302 \nArea ratios of the 5-km grid ammonia emission density for the NCP in 2004 are shown in Fig. 8. Most areas of the 303 \nNCP had an ammonia emission between 40-120 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Hellsten et al. (2008) modelled the ammonia 304 \nemission in the UK at 1-km resolution, and found ammonia emission higher than 30 kg N ha-1 yr-1 only on 1.3% 305 \nof the area as \u2018hotspots\u2019, which was introduced by pig\/poultry farming. Comparing with that result in the UK, 306 \nammonia emission higher than 30 kg N ha-1 yr-1 appeared on 92% of the area of the NCP in our study, which was  307 \nnearly the whole regional area for intensive agricultural practices. Such a high NH3 emission rate plays a major 308 \nrole in secondary particulate formation  of (NH4)2SO4, NH4HSO4 and NH4NO3 in this area (He et al, 2001; Yao, et 309 \nal., 2003; Wang et al., 2005; Duan et al., 2006). Furthermore, most of the emitted ammonia will be deposited back 310 \nto the land, and introduce ecological changes (Abler et al., 1989; Matson et al., 2002). Cape et al. (2009) 311 \nintroduced a new annual critical level of NH3 for higher vegetation of 2-4 \u00b5g m-3; sensitive plant species, such as 312 \nlichens and bryophytes, were even more sensitive, with a critical level of 1 \u00b5g m-3. As the preliminary output 313 \nresults of the N deposition in the NCP (unpublished), which was modelled by the ATM model with the input of 314 \nthe spatial distribution ammonia emission in this study, exceedance of the critical level for NH3 appeared over 315 \n99.6% of the area in the NCP. Stevens et al. (2004) found one species loss per 2.5 kg N ha-1 yr-1 increase in N 316 \ndeposition across British acid grasslands. Although higher tolerance and less sensitivity of the crop system in the 317 \nintensive agricultural area in the NCP resulted in ecological effects which have been ignored for a long time, the 318 \nhigh NH3 emissions will definitely bring in ecological changes even though there is little research to offer any 319 \nevidence to date.   320 \n 321 \n3.4 Uncertainties 322 \nUncertainties of NH3-N emissions in the NCP are associated with both the emissions inventory and the spatial 323 \nallocation. The quality of the emissions inventory is further related to the quality of the input data and the 324 \nemission factors. The spatial allocation is affected by land use maps and the data for agricultural practices, which 325 \nare used to calculate the weight indexes for the different land use classes. Considerable uncertainty is associated 326 \nwith the emission factors and the agricultural practices. The input census data were from the China Statistic 327 \nBureau and local statistical bureaus, and the geographic maps were from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and 328 \n Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy Sciences. Both data sources are currently the most authoritative 329 \navailable.  330 \n 331 \nIt was difficult to quantify the uncertainties in the emission factors, because there are few NH3 emission 332 \nmeasurements available in China. In this study, the emission factors were re-calculated by the RAINS model, 333 \ntaking the husbandry practices in the NCP into consideration, which was considered more consistent with reality 334 \nthan simply using emission factors from elsewhere. Some of the emission factors were quite different compared 335 \nwith previous studies, e.g. about twice those of the former sheep and goat factors. The main reason for this is the 336 \nlower ratio of lambs, which are associated with a smaller emission. In contrast to European countries, Chinese 337 \npeople consume more mutton than lamb. In addition, instead of mostly indoor management like other livestock, 338 \nsheep and goats usually graze more outdoors, which also increased the NH3 emission. The emission factors of 339 \nchicken in the intensive farms were also at the low level comparing with former studies in Table 2. The 340 \nexplanation had been given in the example of the calculation of the emission factor. Mineral fertilizer application 341 \nemission factors were cited from measured results directly, without making any distinction among the provinces, 342 \nas was done for livestock emissions for the whole homogenous land use and agricultural practice.  343 \n 344 \nThe spatial allocation processes introduce another area of uncertainty. Theoretically, the NH3 emission from each 345 \nprefecture would be bottom-up according to the corresponding area based on the land use maps. The agricultural 346 \npractices determined the weighted indexes of different land cover categories. It was effective for the fertilizer use, 347 \nbut more difficult for livestock husbandry, because more processes (housing, storage, spreading and grazing) and 348 \nthe special traditional household managements in the NCP have to be considered for the latter. However, the 349 \nhomogenous farmland land cover and the mostly indoor livestock keeping in the NCP largely simplified the 350 \nprocess. The major uncertainties were not from the theoretical process, but rather associated with the local 351 \nsituation. First of all, the operation of livestock husbandry ranges from household scale to industrial scale and is 352 \nrandomly scattered in the rural area. Second, organic manure use has dramatically declined and been largely 353 \nreplaced by mineral fertilizer use. Only 18% of N was from organic manure in 47% of arable land which still 354 \nreceived organic nutrient in China (Ju et al., 2005). A lot of animal manure was neither treated nor recycled, 355 \nparticularly the liquid manure, and directly discharged into surface waters, which introduced further 356 \nenvironmental problems.  Third, the organic manure was not necessarily applied in the local area. It is mostly 357 \n transported to other areas after production. In this study, all these three possibilities were not taken into 358 \nconsideration, and instead the emissions were assigned onto the local area.  359 \n 360 \nIn addition, all the census data were at prefecture level, and distributed into each prefecture. So, there were 361 \nartificial boundaries between higher and lower emission areas in the spatial variation maps, which were not 362 \nphysically realistic. However, it is true that there were different priorities in the development strategy in different 363 \nregions which introduced variations in both livestock husbandry and fertilizer use in crop farms even on a 364 \nprefecture level. Although we can eliminate this if we use bottom-up emissions on a province level or the NCP 365 \nregional level, it will actually obliterate more spatial realities at a higher resolution.  366 \n 367 \n4. Conclusions 368 \nAn inventory of NH3 emissions at prefecture level in the NCP was carried out for the year 2004. The total 369 \nagricultural NH3-N emission was high (3071 kt yr-1), accounting for 27% of the total emission in China, while the 370 \narea ratio was only 3.3%. 1620 kt yr-1 NH3-N emission derived from fertilizer application, which was the largest 371 \nemissions source, constituting more than half of the total agricultural emission. Livestock emissions contributed 372 \n1451 kt N yr-1, constituting: emissions from cattle (7%), pigs (27%), sheep and goats (7%) and poultry (5%). The 373 \nHenan, Hebei and Shandong provinces made the largest contribution to the total emissions in the NCP.  374 \n 375 \nA high-resolution map of NH3 emissions in the NCP was developed for the first time based on census data and 376 \nland use maps. The highest 5-km grid emission density was 198 kg N ha-1 yr-1. High emissions were found in the 377 \nsouth of the Hebei province, in the west of Shandong province and in most of the Henan province. Generation of 378 \nthis spatial distribution map of ammonia emissions will allow the opportunity to undertake atmospheric transport 379 \nmodelling to provide spatial estimates of wet and dry deposition of N in the NCP. Although there are still some 380 \nuncertainties introduced by the lack of original emission factors in China, the emissions inventory and spatial 381 \ndistribution of NH3 emissions provide indispensable input data for atmospheric transport, N deposition, critical 382 \nload exceedance models and abatement strategies for China in future research.  383 \n 384 \nAcknowledgements 385 \nThe authors are grateful to Dr. Ulrike Dragosits in CEH for her assistance in the introduction of the AENEID 386 \nmodel, to Dr. Amanda Thomson in CEH for her assistance in ARC\/INFO technique, and to the two anonymous 387 \n reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions that have greatly improved the manuscript.
