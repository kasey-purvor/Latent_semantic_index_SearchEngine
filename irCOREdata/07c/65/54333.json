Introduction \nCryptography using chaos found many applications in audio processing \n[Delgado-Restituto, 1996], image processing [Yen, 2000] and communications [Yang, \n1997]. The existing cryptographical algorithms are implemented based on chaotic \noscillator [Delgado-Restituto, 1996], Chua\u2019s circuit [Yang, 1997], modulo operator \n[G\u00f6tz, 1997; Dachselt, 1998] and permutation scheme [Yen, 2000]. However, these \n 2\nalgorithms are formulated based on the time domain state space nonlinear differential \nor difference equations. Hence, the information of the signals at different frequency \nbands does not exploited. Moreover, although these existing nonlinear \ncryptographical systems produce uncorrelated signals, these methods are highly relied \non the corresponding chaotic functions. Hence, details analysis of these chaotic \nfunctions, such as the stability regions of chaotic parameters, sensitivity of these \nparameters to rounding errors, invertibility of the chaotic functions etc, is required. \nUnfortunately, the stability regions of parameters of the existing chaotic functions are \nlimited and these parameters are very sensitive to rounding errors. Hence, it would \ncause significant errors and disasters when these methods are applied to real systems. \nFurthermore, since the structures of the existing chaotic systems are not flexible in the \nsense of changing the number of chaotic generators and their corresponding functions. \nHence, the order of the complexity of the encrypted signals is constrained. In addition, \nthese systems cannot be adapted into the existing international multimedia standards \ndirectly because the existing international multimedia standards are based on the filter \nbank approach. \nOn the other hand, filter bank and wavelets theory is widely studied and found \nmany applications in many engineering disciplines, particularly in multimedia signal \nprocessing applications [Vaidyanathan, 1990; Phoong, 1995; Mao, 2000; Soman, \n1993]. This is because filter bank and wavelets theory exploits both the time domain \nand frequency domain information of the signals. By permuting the subband signals, \nthe signals are encrypted. Although both the encryption and decryption of this method \nis simple because just matrix multiplications are involved, the encrypted signal is \nusually correlated to the input signal. This is because since the power spectrum \ndensity of the input signal is usually not flat, permuting the subband signals cannot \nflatten the power spectral density. Recently, the filter bank and wavelets theory are \nextended to the systems with nonlinearity [Redmill, 1996]. Redmill found that perfect \nreconstruction can be achieved no matter the corresponding subband processing are \nnoninvertible, noncausal, nonlinear and time varying. Also, the filter system is very \nflexible in the sense of changing the number of subband processing units and their \ncorresponding functions. However, Redmill does not explore any applications. \nIn this paper, a chaotic filter bank for computer cryptography is proposed. Our \nproposed system enjoys both the advantages of the traditional filter bank approach \n 3\nand the existing nonlinear chaotic approach because the chaotic functions can produce \nan uncorrelated signal and the filter bank structure ensures perfect reconstruction no \nmatter the chaotic functions are noninvertible, noncausal, nonlinear and time varying. \nThe outline of this paper is as follows: The cryptographical system is discussed in \nsection 2 and simulation results are given in section 3. Finally, a conclusion is \nsummarized in section 4. \n \n2.  Proposed cryptographical system \nRefer to figure 1: let [ ]nx  and [ ]ny  be the input and the reconstructed signal of \nthe filter bank system; [ ]nt0  and [ ]nt1  be the subband signals decomposed by the \nanalysis bank; [ ]nv0  and [ ]nv1  be the encrypted subband signals; [ ]nw0  and [ ]nw1  be \nthe decrypted subband signals; ( )zHi  and ( )zFi  for 1,0=i  be the analysis filters and \nsynthesis filters; 2\u2193  and 2\u2191  be a 2 -fold decimator and 2 -fold expander; 0K  and \n1K  be the gains multiplied on each channels; and ( )\u22c5i\u03b1  for 1,0=i  be the chaotic \nfunctions, respectively. \nThe various signals in figure 1 can be expressed as follows: \n[ ] [ ] [ ]\u2211\n\u2200\n\u2212=\nm\nmnhmxKnt 2000 , (1) \n[ ] [ ] [ ]\u2211\n\u2200\n\u2212=\nm\nmnhmxKnt 2111 , (2) \n[ ] [ ] [ ]( )ntntnv 1000 \u03b1+= , (3) \n[ ] [ ] [ ]( )nvntnv 0111 \u03b1\u2212= , (4) \n[ ] [ ] [ ]( ) [ ]ntnvnvnw 10111 =+= \u03b1 , (5) \n[ ] [ ] [ ]( ) [ ]ntnwnvnw 01000 =\u2212= \u03b1 , (6) \nand \n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\u2211\u2211\n\u2200\u2200\n\u2212+\u2212=\nmm\nmnfmw\nK\nmnfmw\nK\nny 2121 11\n1\n00\n0\n. (7) \nA filter bank is said to achieve perfect reconstruction if [ ]ny  is a delayed gain \nversion of [ ]nx . That is, \u211c\u2208\u2203c  and Zm \u2208\u2203 0  such that [ ] [ ]0mncxny \u2212=  Zn\u2208\u2200 . \nThis property is important in cryptography because this guarantees decryption is \nlossless. It is shown in [Redmill, 1996] that the filter bank system achieves perfect \nreconstruction if and only if \n 4\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1=\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\n02\n1 0\n1\n0\n10\n10\nmcz\nzF\nzF\nzHzH\nzHzH\n, (8) \nno matter ( )\u22c5i\u03b1  for 1,0=i  are noninvertible, noncausal, nonlinear and time varying \nfunctions. This property provides a great flexibility in design because one can embed \nsignals in different frequency bands by employing different chaotic functions, and the \nnumber of chaotic generators as well as their corresponding functions can be selected \nand designed in a more flexible manner. \nBy expressing the filters in the polyphase representation, that is \n( ) ( )\u2211\n=\n\u2212=\n1\n0\n2\n,\nl\nli\nl\ni zEzzH  (9) \nand \n( ) ( )\u2211\n=\n\u2212=\n1\n0\n2\n,\n1\nl\nil\nl\ni zRzzF , (10) \nfor 1,0=i , the perfect reconstruction condition becomes \n( ) ( ) IER 0mczzz \u2212= , (11) \nwhere I is an identity matrix [Vaidyanathan, 1990]. \nIt is found that if ( )zE  is a paraunitary matrix, that is \n( ) ( ) IEE dzz =~ , (12) \nwhere d  is a constant and ( )zE~  denotes ( )1\u2212\u2217 zTE  in which ( )z\u2217E  represents the \nconjugation of the coefficients of ( )zE , then the wavelets generated by the binary tree \nstructure filter bank is orthonormal [Soman, 1993]. Since Haar wavelets is the unique \nwavelets function that is orthogonal, symmetrical, and of compact support. This \nwavelets function is chosen in our case. The mother wavelets function of Haar \ntransform and the corresponding polyphase matrix are \n( )\n\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23a7\n<<\u2212\n<<\n=\notherwise\nt\nt\nt\n0\n15.01\n5.001\n\u03c8 , (13) \nand \n( ) \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212= 11\n11\nzE , (14) \nrespectively. \nIn order to generate uncorrelated signals, we employ the logistic maps as the \n 5\nchaotic functions. The nonlinear functions are \n( ) ( ) ( )( )kxkxkx iiii \u2212=+ 11 \u03bb , (15) \n( ) ( ) ( )kukxky iii += , (16) \nfor 1,0=i , where i\u03bb , ( )kxi , ( )kui  and ( )kyi  are the parameters, state variables, inputs \nand outputs of the function ( )\u22c5i\u03b1 , respectively. It is worth noting that ( )\u22c5i\u03b1  is in \ngeneral not invertible, and chaotic behaviors are exhibited if ( ) 100 << ix  and \n43 << i\u03bb . Hence, the parameters and the initial conditions are selected in these \nranges for our case. In the cryptographical system, i\u03bb  is used as the public keys, and \n( )0ix  is used as private keys. Since the logistic map is very sensitive to both i\u03bb  and \n( )0ix  because of its chaotic nature, different users will get very different encrypted \nsignals and they cannot decrypt other users\u2019 signals by using its own private keys. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. The proposed chaotic filter bank system. \n \n3.  Simulation results \nIn this paper, we choose a standard one dimensional test signal [Mallat, 1992], \na simple sinusoidal signal and a random Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit \nvariance as test inputs. The parameters are selected as 01.00 =K , 04.01 =K , \n98.30 =\u03bb , 41 =\u03bb , ( ) 7.000 =x , ( ) 9.001 =x , 1=c  and 00 =m , respectively. The \nsimulation results are shown in figures 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The correlation \ncoefficients (\n22\nji\nji\nvt\nvt\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\n) are summarized in table 1. According to the results shown in \ntable 1, the encrypted subband signals are almost uncorrelated to the subband signals \ndecomposed by the analysis bank, which implies that the encryption performance is \nvery good. \n[ ]nx   [ ]ny  \n( )zH0  \n( )zH1  \n2\u2193  \n2\u2193\n2\u2191  \n2\u2191\n( )zF0  \n( )zF1  1K  \n( )\u22c50\u03b1 ( )\u22c5\u2212 1\u03b1 ( )\u22c51\u03b1 ( )\u22c5\u2212 0\u03b1\n[ ]nt0  \n[ ]nt1  \n[ ]nv0  \n[ ]nv1  \n[ ]nw0\n[ ]nw1  \n0K  \n1\n1\nK\n \n0\n1\nK\n \n 6\nTable 2 summarizes the ratios of subband signal power ( [ ]\u2211\n\u2200n\ni nt\n2 ) to the \nsubband chaotic signal power ( [ ] [ ]\u2211\n\u2200\n\u2212\nn\nii ntnv\n2 ) for each channel in the filter bank \nsystem. It is interesting to note that although these ratios are very low, perfect \nreconstruction is still guaranteed. Also, the designers can easily change these ratios by \nchanging the values of 0K  and 1K , respectively. \n One dimensional test \nsignal [Mallat, 1992]\nSimple \nsinusoidal signal\nRandom \nGaussian noise \n2\n0\n2\n0\n00\nvt\nvt\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\n \n0002.0\u2212  0572.0  1177.0  \n2\n1\n2\n0\n10\nvt\nvt\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\n \n0352.0  0073.0\u2212  0038.0  \n2\n0\n2\n1\n01\nvt\nvt\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\n \n2011.0  0001.0\u2212  2582.0  \n2\n1\n2\n1\n11\nvt\nvt\n\u03c3\u03c3\n\u03c3\n \n0908.0\u2212  0014.0\u2212  0292.0  \nTable 1.
