This paper describes his other significant contributions, as a clinician interested in family\ndynamics and the impact of real events in the genesis of childhood anxieties, and as an institution\nbuilder in his role in establishing a psychoanalytically based training in Child Psychotherapy oriented\ntowards public health.\nKeywords: Child psychotherapy, post-war developments in the NHS, family therapy, the Tavistock\nchild psychotherapy training\nJohn Bowlby\u2019s role in building institutional structures which fostered clinical creativity is\nperhaps less well known than his research work which established the foundations of\nattachment theory. For those who grew up in the context he influenced he was a figure of\nmajor importance, and the international reputation of the Tavistock Clinic and of its child\npsychotherapy training owes him a great debt. His vision of the potential of the Department\nof Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic was pivotal. He had not only a conception of\nthe necessity for work with both children and parents in a child mental health clinic, and\nimaginative ideas about different ways in which that could be done, but also a picture of\nmulti-disciplinary collaboration which was exemplary. The pre-war child guidance model of\nparallel work with children and mothers was expanded in several ways. First, the wider\ncontext of the children\u2019s lives was to be taken account of through attention to the child\u2019s\nschool experience and the involvement of fathers in the clinical work. Second, he was part of\na small group of psychoanalysts and analytically minded child psychiatrists who believed that\na new profession of child psychotherapy was needed. Their argument was that the number\nof children who required specialized treatment was far too large to be met by current\nprofessional resources. The understanding of the child\u2019s mind taking shape within child\nanalysis was impressive, and the pool of experienced professionals who would be interested\nto undertake a further formal training as part of the development of a public health oriented\nchild and family mental health service was of excellent calibre. Hitherto, training had only\nbeen available within the narrower context of child analytic training or on an individual\nad hoc basis.\nCorrespondence: Margaret Rustin, Tavistock Clinic, 120 Belsize Lane, London NW3 5BA.

It soon became apparent that Bick and\nBowlby did not get on at a personal level, and her emphasis on internal factors in children\u2019s\nemotional difficulties was too narrow for his taste. Before she moved on, Bick was able to\nestablish training which combined naturalistic infant observation, the academic study of\nchild development and of psychoanalytic theory, and closely supervised clinical work with\nchildren and adolescents alongside personal analysis. Martha Harris, with whom Bowlby\nhad a warm rapport, was Bick\u2019s successor. The Bowlby\/Harris duo represented different\nemphases but they worked together well, and their students understood that these disparate\nelements were a necessary part of their training. There was some space for individuals to go\nmore in one or the other direction, and some of the early child psychotherapy trainees like\nMary Boston and Dina Rosenbluth worked closely in Bowlby\u2019s research team with James\nRobertson.\nAs well as making this new training possible within the Tavistock Clinic, Bowlby\ncontributed to the creation of the Association of Child Psychotherapists, which linked three\ntrainings together: the one Anna Freud had started at a similar time in the Hampstead\nClinic, the Tavistock Clinic training, and a third led by Margaret Loewenfeld, located in the\nInstitute of Child Psychology. Bowlby\u2019s political experience and wisdom was needed to\nprotect the new baby of child psychotherapy within a complex of institutional interest which\ncould have throttled it; the Tavistock Clinic itself was dominated by adult psychoanalysis,\nand work with children was seen as second-class at that time. The Institute of\nPsychoanalysis, on some of whose members\u2019 support the trainings had to be built to\nprovide the personal analysis for students and the clinical supervision of cases, was\nambivalent about training outside its own boundaries; the idea of non-medical practitioners\ntaking on the intensive treatment of seriously disturbed children and adolescents and\nacquiring independent expertise and status was by no means universally accepted. Bowlby\u2019s\nloyalty to the project remained solid and meant an enormous amount to this tiny profession\nas it emerged.\nBowlby was part of a post-war generation who believed they could change things in\nquite profound ways for children and families, that they had a knowledge base to do this\nappropriately, and that research could and would expand our understanding of human\nrelations further. It was a time of hopefulness about fundamental change. At the Tavistock\nClinic the caveats about the negative forces in human beings which could unleash a world\nwar and attack and destroy creativity were always part of the culture; the Kleinian\ntradition within British psychoanalysis had taken up some of the more pessimistic\nstrands of Freud\u2019s thought, and ideas about the origins, nature, and forms of human\ndestructiveness were much discussed. Bowlby\u2019s optimism and radicalism must have\nrepresented the positive pole in this small but intense hothouse. The people he disagreed\nwith often shared vital elements in his perspective, and alliances could thus be sustained\nand work got done. Analytically minded clinicians and researchers were all outsiders in\nsome ways; the dominant paradigm in psychiatry was certainly not either psychoanalysis\nor the beginnings of attachment theory and the academic world remained hostile to all\nthis with some small exceptions. Bowlby\u2019s efforts to make a link for the Tavistock Clinic\nwith London University were rebuffed, making it clear that this was an organization that\nhad to stay on the margin, tolerated by the Establishment in gadfly mode. How strange\nthis now seems when we look at the international scope of attachment theory and\nresearch.\n356 M. Rustin\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n15\n:2\n5 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nBowlby\u2019s clinical thinking also deserves our attention. There are a number of significant\ncontributions, but two retain a particular freshness. The first was a paper published in 1949:\n\u2018\u2018The study and reduction of group tensions in the family.\u2019\u2019 This is how it started:\nChild guidance workers all over the world have come to recognize more and more clearly\nthat the overt problem which is brought to the Clinic in the person of the child is not the\nreal problem; the problem which as a rule we need to solve is the tension between all the\ndifferent members of the family (Bowlby, 1949).\nWhat he goes on to demonstrate is his development of a model of experimental family\ntherapy combined with individual work with family members, both child and parents. So\nhere we have Bowlby the psychoanalytic family therapist, drawing on the theories of\nWilfred Bion and Elliott Jaques about group functioning to adapt traditional models of\nparallel work with child and parents to one in which the dynamics of the family group can\nbe addressed in joint interviews. In a fascinating final section of the paper, he also\nexplores, in a very optimistic vein, the idea that benign processes in one social context\n(e.g., in a family helped by a clinical intervention) can influence much beyond the family\u2019s\nboundaries. Children go to school, adults work in the wider world, and so on, and their\nbetter states of mind will influence these contexts too, he argues. It is useful to keep this in\nmind when as clinicians we worry about how we can ever do enough to make a difference\nin the context of increasing expectations, evidence of higher levels of distress, and\nconstraints in resources; one good piece of work can, Bowlby is pointing out, have a\npositive impact in complex ways. This paper is an instance of Bowlby\u2019s capacity to link\nideas from different intellectual origins in creative ways. His approach to work with\nfamilies became one vital strand in the Tavistock Clinic\u2019s development of family therapy.\nHe combined attention to unconscious dynamic factors in the minds of family members,\nwith an exploration of the family system, and indeed much wider systemic influences. The\nlater divergence between systemic and psychoanalytic thinkers was not consistent with\nBowlby\u2019s convictions.\nA second significant contribution is his paper: \u2018\u2018Knowing what you are not supposed to\nknow and feeling what you are not supposed to feel\u2019\u2019 (Bowlby, 1988). The final version of\nthis has a cognitive focus and feel to it, but its broader import was his version of the\nimpact of real traumatic events on children\u2019s minds. He never tired of enquiring about\nwhat a child might have actually experienced as a crucial element in understanding\nanxieties and behavioural problems. Although he argued that psychoanalytic therapists\nwere guilty of ignoring real events and overvaluing fantasy, the work of Selma Fraiberg\nand all that has developed in the field of infant mental health, to take one well-known\nexample, allows us to open up the question of what is included in this category of \u2018\u2018real\nevents.\u2019\u2019 The unconscious identifications in a mother\u2019s mind are all too real when they\nhave the character of the ghosts in the nursery she described. Similarly, Bion\u2019s theory of\ncontainer and contained drew attention to the importance of the qualities of the container\nand the disastrous results of the absence of the containment of infantile anxiety on the\ndevelopment of a capacity for thought. I would like to suggest that, although Bowlby took\na stance rather critical of analytic thinking and practice, he remained in many ways deeply\nin tune with its ideas while adopting other forms of description. Making therapeutic\ncontact with a child damaged through massive neglect or projections which have\nundermined his sense of reality means the therapist getting to know at gut level about\nfeeling driven mad, and the desperate psychological measures taken to protect the self in\nsuch circumstances. This is the work that cannot be avoided.\nBowlby at the Tavistock 357\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n15\n:2\n5 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nA recent clinical example which exemplifies Bowlby\u2019s impact on child psychotherapists\ncomes to mind. The work is with a child with major physical and cognitive defects, and is\ntaking place within his special school. Despite his enormous difficulties in verbal\ncommunication, his impulsiveness and aggressive behaviour, and his physical disorganiza-\ntion and frailty, school staff felt there was an inner richness which could be reached by\nindividual therapy. This proved to be the case, as his imaginative therapist found ways to\nperceive the rhythmic qualities he was reaching for, which could give some more shape\nand meaning to his life. As their conversational reciprocity began to grow, this little boy\u2019s\nawareness of his enormous and tragic limitations also came into focus. Alongside this was\nthe evidence in the therapy of an internal maternal object which turned a blind eye to the\nreality of the child\u2019s damaged state, and work being done by a colleague with the mother\nin fact confirmed that denial, idealization, and infantalization characterized her relation-\nship with her son. Here was a child using his therapist to help him to know what he was\nnot being allowed to know within the family setting. The freedom to have his own\nexperience which therapy provided seemed a vital step in his developing much greater\nverbal capacities.\nMy own experience of Bowlby\u2019s contributions to multi-disciplinary case conferences\nunderlines another characteristic of his clinical approach. The patient I was presenting was\na highly disturbed 6-year-old who had a grim early history, including major prematurity\nand a hospital admission without her mother\u2019s presence at 12-months-old aimed at forced\nweaning, in her mother\u2019s recollection, during which she cracked her skull by head-\nbanging. The family history was also very distressing since her father grew up in Poland\nduring the war years. In her sessions with me, the extremity of her mental state was\nexpressed in unmistakably primitive terms. She was preoccupied with the dread of a\ndestroyed inner world which could not be repaired and by the absence of protective good\nobjects and their replacement by vengeful persecutors. I was astounded by the material\nwhich, week by week, seemed to demonstrate the accuracy of some of Melanie Klein\u2019s\ntheories about early infantile life. At the same time, it put me in touch with how\nintergenerational trauma can impact on development, that is how powerful unconscious\nprojections by parents can shape a child\u2019s mind. One example that stunned me was when\nmy patient referred to the Auschwitz furnaces in her play; that was where bad babies were\nthrown, she said.\nAt the end of my clinical presentation, Dr. Bowlby said that this was the kind of child\nfor whom intensive psychotherapy was an absolute requirement. He suggested that there\nwere undoubtedly elements of brain damage in my patient, and I think he was right about\nthis, but that this was all the more reason for providing this treatment for her, to give her\nthe best possible chance of developing her potential and making life for her and her family\nmore bearable. As I was fully aware of the risk of a Klein vs. Bowlby scrap over this case\namong the senior staff in the department, I was impressed by his dual kindness, to the\npatient and to me as a youthful child psychotherapy trainee. I think he would be pleased\nat the way in which child psychotherapists have proved themselves committed to work\nwith groups of patients whose life chances are severely compromised. Work with deprived,\nneglected, and maltreated children, with refugees, and with children with learning\ndisabilities, including autism, are some of the everyday specialities of the profession he\nhelped to bring into being. Bowlby noted that different therapeutic modalities sometimes\nconverge and would probably have liked the more pluralistic clinical context we live in,\nbut I think he would never have underestimated the difficulty of the work to be done\nand would probably have been politely sceptical about today\u2019s plethora of quick-fix\nremedies.\n358 M.
