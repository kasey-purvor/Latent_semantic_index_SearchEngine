INTRODUCTION\nThe superfluidity of liquid 4He disappears abruptly when critical ve-\nlocities are exceeded. It has long been appreciated that this process may\ninvolve either the creation of rotons1 or quantized vortices2,3 or, much more\ncommonly, the expansion of remanent4 vortices pre-existing in the liquid. In\nflow experiments it is the latter process that usually dominates, leading to\ncritical velocities of typically mm s\u22121 or cm s\u22121. In stationary He II, the\nremanent vortices are presumed to be pinned between protuberances on the\nvessel walls. The mechanism through which they suddenly expand out into\nthe flowing liquid to form a tangle of quantum vorticity, once the critical\nPublished in J. Low Temp. Phys. 138, 543-548 (2005).\nP.C. Hendry et al\nvelocity has been attained, has been studied for e.g. a micron-sized orifice of\na particular shape 5 but, in general, has remained something of a mystery.\nRecent experiments6,7 appear, however, to offer the possibility of gain-\ning insight into the fundamental processes in question. They involve studies\nof He II flow due to a macroscopically large electrostatically-driven oscil-\nlating grid in the zero temperature limit where the normal fluid compo-\nnent of He II is almost absent. Electron micrographs show that one side\nof the grid is relatively smooth, whereas the other is densely covered in\napproximately hemispherical submicron-sized protuberances8. This micro-\nscopic surface roughness may perhaps be significant for the interpretation of\nthe results obtained (see below). Where influenced by vorticity, the proper-\nties of flow through the grid represent an average over a large ensemble of\nquantized vortices, and should be reproducible and independent of the posi-\ntions\/configurations of individual vortex lines. Details of the experiments6,7\nand some aspects of current theoretical understanding8 have already been\npublished. In what follows, we attempt to summarise the status of the work\nand identify the remaining open questions an opportunities for the future.\n2. EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS\nA striking feature of the observed grid response is that it is history-\ndependent. Fig. 1 shows how the resonance curves differ if measured fol-\nlowing an increase of pressure in the cell (we refer to such a response as\nvirgin), as compared to the behaviour after violently shaking the grid by\nmeans of the highest available drive \u2248 10 Vpp (which we refer to as regular).\nFollowing this \u201ccleaning\u201d procedure, the resonant frequency and linewidth\nwere reproducible to \u00b10.1 Hz on a time scale of days.\nFig. 1 shows that the virgin and regular behaviours differed in three im-\nportant respects. First, the virgin resonant frequency is slightly downshifted.\nSecondly, the virgin linewidth at low drive was about 0.5 Hz, compared to\n\u223c 0.2 Hz for a \u201ccleaned\u201d grid. Thirdly, as the response amplitude reached\nabout 100 mVpp, the behaviour abruptly changed, in that very robust re-\nproducible beatings were then obtained7. Remanent vorticity4 provides the\nmost likely explanation of these differences. Increasing the cell pressure pre-\nsumably causes generation of quantized vortices in the jet from the filling\ncapillary. They are likely to reconnect, mutually and with image vortices\nin walls and electrodes, leaving additional remanent vorticity pinned to the\ngrid or between the grid and the surrounding electrodes. They may well\ncause the additional shift in resonant frequency in the low drive limit and\nbroadening of the resonance peak (see Fig. 1).\nQuestions Related to the Oscillatory Flow of He II through a Grid...\n1083 1084 1085 1086 1087 1088 1089 1090 1091 1092 1093\n1\n10\n100\nre\np\no\nn\nse\n a\nm\np\nlit\nu\nd\ne \n(m\nV\np\np\n)\nfrequency (Hz)\n 0.02\n 0.05\n 0.1\n 0.3\n 1\n 3\n 10\n 0.54\n 0.27\n 0.135\n 0.054\nFig. 1. Resonance curves measured at 3.5 bar using the memory oscilloscope\nfor drive levels (in Vpp) as indicated. Filled symbols represent the regular\ngrid behaviour, while the virgin behaviour is represented by resonant curves\ncomposed of the open symbols. The upper three curves are shown up to the\ndrive amplitude at which the onset of beating occurred6,7.\nThe regular behaviour of the \u201ccleaned\u201d grid was qualitatively the same\nat all pressures. For low drives, the resonant response is Lorentzian, with a\nquality Q factor comparable to that in vacuum. Resonance curves measured\nin vacuum coincide with those for the same drive levels in He II, provided\nthat the frequency scale is shifted down by about 30 Hz, an effect well\nunderstood in terms of the hydrodynamic enhancement of the effective mass\nof the grid7. As the drive increases, the mean grid velocity reaches a first\nthreshold of 0.3 < v\n(1)\ng < 0.6 cm\/s, beyond which the oscillation amplitude\nat resonance still continues to rise in proportion to the drive, while the\nresonant frequency rather suddenly starts decreasing. Stable hysteresis loops\nare observed; one can circle them many times, providing that the frequency\nis changed very slowly or in very small steps. They are not appreciably\naffected by an increase of temperature up to our maximum of 130 mK.\nThe data therefore represent phenomena occurring in the zero temperature\nlimit of He II flow. The down-shift in frequency with increasing drive reaches\nP.C. Hendry et al\ntypically 2 Hz (see Fig. 1 ceasing at a second pressure-independent threshold.\nWith further increase in drive, the oscillation amplitude at resonance initially\nremains almost constant, while the widths of the resonance curves increase\nrapidly. Only for drive levels exceeding by about an order of magnitude that\nneeded to reach the second threshold does the amplitude at resonance grow\nagain; this time approximately in proportion to the square-root of the drive,\ntypical for a fully developed turbulent flow in a classical liquid. It is therefore\nmost likely that the second threshold marks the onset of turbulence.\n3. THEORETICAL PICTURE\nHow can we account for the pronounced downwards frequency shift\nthat occurs while the resonant response rises from the first to the second\nthreshold?\nA possible explanation has been formulated8 in terms of small loops of\nremanent vorticity. The surface roughness of the grid (see above) may be\nan important factor in the pinning of such loops. The response of a vortex\nloop will depend on whether it is significantly longer or shorter than the\nminimum resonant length ` \u2248 13 \u00b5m required by the dispersion relation for\na Kelvin wave. If the loop is shorter than `, it will respond adiabatically,\nin that its position and configuration in the flow will always correspond to\nequilibrium. For loops that are significantly longer than `, Kelvin waves will\nbe excited, leading to dissipation. It may occur either through to the transfer\nof energy via a Kelvin wave cascade to very high frequencies, at which there\ncan be significant phonon radiation, or through the evaporation of small\nvortex rings9) following reconnection. It is likely that the longer vortex\nloops (including those connecting the grid to the neighbouring electrodes)\nare removed during the \u201ccleaning\u201d procedure. When a vortex loop pinned by\nboth ends to the grid responds adiabatically, it enhances the effective mass\nof the grid by %HeII\u03ba(dS\/dv), without increasing the damping\n8. Here S(v) is\nthe area between the loop and the neighbouring walls. For small velocities,\nS(v) is probably a linear function of the flow velocity, v, and the overall effect\nis a constant, amplitude independent, enhancement of the effective mass of\nthe grid. If S(v) were to become nonlinear at the first threshold, however,\nthe observed highly nonlinear form of measured resonance curves can be\naccounted for: it would be necessary for the non-linear part of the loop area\nto contribute \u223c2500 \u00b5m2 per window of the grid at the second threshold. It\nfollows that mass enhancement through this mechanism cannot be due only a\nfew loops \u2013 they would be too long to respond adiabatically. If one considers\nalso the stability of these loops against \u201cballooning out\u201d below the second\nQuestions Related to the Oscillatory Flow of He II through a Grid...\nthreshold, the analysis8 suggests a dense boundary layer constituted of small\nloops, with \u223c103 per grid aperture, i.e., at least \u223c 108 loops altogether, each\nsized \u223c1 \u00b5m or less.\n4. DISCUSSION\nIt is tempting to suppose that the formation of an effective bound-\nary layer constituted of vortex loops is universal. It is consistent with our\nobservation that, while increasing the drive amplitude, the system seems to\nencounter a nucleation problem when passing the first threshold: on some oc-\ncasions the response stopped growing with increasing drive level, and jumped\nonto the usual response\/drive curve only later. With decreasing drive this\nfeature disappears, and the response remains always proportional to the\ndrive level. Perhaps, employing the ideas of Kusmartsev10, the boundary\nlayer can grow from a \u201cplasma\u201d of half vortex rings, although the critical\nvelocities derived by Kusmartsev are larger than those considered here. The\ndifficulties associated with intrinsic vortex nucleation are well-established3\nand intrinsic critical velocities in microscopically small channels are assumed\nto be \u223c30 m\/s at low temperature. Here, on the other hand, we have an\nopen geometry, the grid surface is very rough and substantial enhancement\nof flow around excrescences is possible.\nAnother possibility is that the boundary layer is essentially extrinsic,\nin that quantized vortex loops are generated on the surface of the grid by\nmacroscopic superflow around it, involving growth from remanent vortex\nlines4, perhaps during the cleaning procedure.\nIt is interesting to characterize the first threshold in terms of a peak\nsuperfluid Reynolds number Res = UmaxG\/\u03ba \u2248 10\u2212 30, where Umax stands\nfor a peak critical flow velocity through the grid window, G is its linear size\nand \u03ba denotes the circulation quantum. The observed values of Res compare\nsurprisingly well with the critical Res = UD\/\u03ba \u2248 20 (U is the transport\nvelocity andD the diameter of the pipe) found as a temperature independent\nthreshold in pipe flow of He II at much higher temperatures when the flow\nof the normal component was inhibited by superleaks placed at both ends of\nthe pipe11. This suggests that the underlying physical mechanism, although\nnot understood, might persist at temperatures above 1.4 K where there is\nan appreciable fraction of normal fluid.\nThere is experimental evidence that the position of the first threshold\nmight depend on the highest drive previously used, i.e., on the degree of\n\u201ccleaning\u201d 6\u20138. This observation supports the idea that driving the grid at\nhigh amplitude causes a re-arrangement of remanent vorticity.\nP.C. Hendry et al\n5. OPEN QUESTIONS\nThe results described pose intriguing fundamental questions, such as:\n(i) Is the formation of an effective boundary layer constituted of vortex\nloops intrinsic to any temperature and any superflow over a solid boundary?\n(ii) Is the nucleation process of vortex loops of intrinsic or extrinsic origin?\n(iii) How is the nucleation process affected by frequency, surface roughness,\nhistory, temperature? (iv) Why is the first threshold pressure dependent,\nwhile the second seems not? (v) Can we learn more about generation of\nquantum turbulence, or, possibly, turbulence in general? (vi) Are the results\nexclusive to pure He II, or can they also be observed in boundary layer flows\nof other quantum fluids? It is the extreme lightness of the grid that promises\nto facilitate investigation of the growth of the loops from remanent vortices\n\u2013 for most materials\/structures, the corresponding changes in effective mass\nwould be unobservably small. We hope that such studies will lead to a deeper\nunderstanding of this process, which is fundamental to the breakdown of\nsuperfluidity in most situations of practical interest.\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge fruitful discussions with many colleagues,\nespecially D.
