Data from simultaneous observations (on 13\nFebruary 1996, 9 November 1998, and 12 February 1999)\nwith the IRIS, DASI and EISCAT systems are employed in\nthe study of the energy distribution of the electron precipita-\ntion during substorm activity. The estimation of the charac-\nteristic energy of the electron precipitation over the common\nfield of view of IRIS and DASI is discussed. In particular,\nwe look closely at the physical basis of the correspondence\nbetween the characteristic energy, the flux-averaged energy,\nas defined below, and the logarithm of the ratio of the green-\nlight intensity to the square of absorption. This study ex-\npands and corrects results presented in the paper by Kosch et\nal. (2001). It is noticed, moreover, that acceleration associ-\nated with diffusion processes in the magnetosphere long be-\nfore precipitation may be controlling the shape of the energy\nspectrum. We propose and test a \u201cmixed\u201d distribution for the\nenergy-flux spectrum, exponential at the lower energies and\nMaxwellian or modified power-law at the higher energies,\nwith a threshold energy separating these two regimes. The\nenergy-flux spectrum at Troms\u00f8, in the 1\u2013320 keV range, is\nderived from EISCAT electron density profiles in the 70\u2013\n140 km altitude range and is applied in the \u201ccalibration\u201d of\nthe optical intensity and absorption distributions, in order to\nextrapolate the flux and characteristic energy maps.\nKey words.

The size, structure, and evo-\nlution of both the absorption and the optical signatures are\nmeasures of the properties of the ionisation patches and cor-\nresponding optical forms, as well as of the associated pre-\ncipitation source in the magnetosphere. Many observations\nhave established that fluctuations in auroral intensity are cor-\nrelated with variations in absorption, as well as with the ion\nproduction and average electron densities at the correspond-\ning height ranges where most of the optical emission and ab-\nsorption occur (Rees, 1963; Johansen, 1965; Berkey, 1968;\nGustafsson, 1969; Stoker et al., 1996). (See the book by\nRees, 1989 for a thorough review of the theoretical and ex-\nperimental basis underlying these correlations.)\nThe aim of this study is to correct and expand the initial\nresults from the paper by Kosch et al. (2001) and to present\nsome physical arguments to justify the method to estimate\nthe characteristic energy and flux of the precipitating elec-\ntrons over the common field of view of the IRIS and DASI\ninstruments. In particular, we look closely at the physical\nbasis of the observed correspondence between the character-\nistic energy defined below, and the logarithm of the ratio of\nthe green-light intensity to the square of absorption. We also\ninclude new data and look in some detail at the estimation of\nthe characteristic energy and the flux-averaged energy of the\nenergy-flux spectrum.\nKosch et al. (2001) have demonstrated that it is possible\nto produce a two-dimensional map of the characteristic en-\nergy of precipitating particles for a given spectral function\n(e.g. Maxwellian or exponential). Assuming that the high\nenergy (>25 keV) and low energy (<15 keV) components\nof the particle precipitation come from the same population\nin the magnetosphere, with D-region radio-wave absorption\n(Abs) proportional to the square root of the flux of high en-\nergy particles (>25 keV) and E-region auroral intensity at\n557.7 nm (Int) proportional to the flux of low energy parti-\ncles (<15 keV), the characteristic energy (Eo) of an assumed\nenergy distribution is proportional to the logarithm of ratio\nInt\/(Abs)2. Kosch et al. (2001), however, made a mistake by\ncomparing the characteristic energy Eo with log(Int0.5\/Abs).\n1350 C. F. del Pozo et al.: Estimation of the characteristic energy of electron precipitation\nThis mistake did indeed propagate to their results, but fortu-\nnately, because the characteristic energy Eo is proportional\nto log (Int\/Abs2), and not to log (Int0.5\/Abs), as they incor-\nrectly stated, the structure of their \u201cenergy maps\u201d was not\naffected but only the energy levels by a linear factor of the\norder of 2 (allowing for some dispersion due to the statistical\nnature of the linear regression between log (Int\/Abs2) and log\n(F(E2)\/F(E1)).\nThe energy-flux spectrum of electrons at Troms\u00f8, in the\n1\u2013320 keV range, is derived from electron density profiles\nmeasured with EISCAT UHF radar in the 70\u2013140 km alti-\ntude range (del Pozo et al., 1997, 1999) and applied in the\n\u201ccalibration\u201d of the green-line intensity and absorption dis-\ntributions, in order to extrapolate the flux and characteris-\ntic energy maps over the common field of view of the IRIS\nand DASI systems. EISCAT (European Incoherent Scatter\nat 933 MHz, Rishbeth and Williams, 1985) is a tri-static sys-\ntem with fully steerable antennas 32-m in diameter at Troms\u00f8\n(69.6\u25e6 N, 19.2\u25e6 E), Kiruna (67.9\u25e6 N, 20.4\u25e6 E) and Sodankyla\u00a8\n(67.4\u25e6 N, 26.7\u25e6 E). It measures the height profiles of various\nionospheric parameters (Ne, T e, T i) and the electric field.\nIRIS (Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies) at Kil-\nspisja\u00a8rvi (69.05\u25e6 N, 20.8\u25e6 E) records the absorption of cos-\nmic radio noise at 38 MHz as measured in 49 different di-\nrections (Browne et al., 1995). The bulk of the absorption\ncorresponds to ionisation caused by electrons with initial en-\nergies ranging from a few 10 keV up to a few 100 keV, with\ndeposition heights generally centred at \u223c 90 km. IRIS gives\na picture of the horizontal extent of the ionisation with a min-\nimum time resolution of 1 s. Spatial resolution, as defined by\nthe 3-dB points of the beams, ranges between 20 and 60 km\n(Collis et al., 1996). DASI (Digital All Sky Imager, (Kosch\net al., 1998), at 69.35\u25e6 N, 20.36\u25e6 E) measures the green-light\nauroral emission in rayleighs at 557.7 nm at 10 s resolution.\nThe zenith angle of the original all-sky images is converted to\nnorth-south horizontal distance from vertical (near Troms\u00f8),\nwith an overall spatial resolution of 10\u00d710 km, although the\nabsolute resolution is 0.1\u25e6 in zenith angle, which goes from\n200 m to 4 km for zenith angles from 0\u25e6 to 80\u25e6. All-sky cam-\neras record the light emission from the excitation of neutral\ngases and ions by precipitating electrons with energies be-\ntween 100 eV and a few keV. Most of the auroral luminos-\nity is due to the green-light emission from the altitude range\n90\u2013120 km, with peak frequency of occurrence between 100\nand 110 km (Egeland and Omholt, 1967). The effective IRIS\nfield of view at 90\u2013100 km height is a square of 240-km side\ncentred at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi and corresponding to 6\u25e6 lon. (17.75\u25e6\u2013\n23.75\u25e6 lon.) and 2.4\u25e6 lat. (67.8\u25e6\u201370.2\u25e6 lat.). The standard\ndigitised coverage from DASI is a square of 500 km side\ncentred at Skibotn, or 12.5\u25e6 lon. (13.5\u25e6\u201326\u25e6 lon.) and 5\u25e6 lat.\n(67.6\u25e6\u201372.6\u25e6 lat.).\n1.1 Characteristic energy, absorption and luminosity\nThe flux of precipitating electrons can be represented by a\nmodified power-law dependence, with the exponential and\nMaxwellian spectra as particular cases (Rees, 1989):\nF(E) = Ao(E \/Eo)\u03b3 exp(\u2212E \/Eo) , (1)\nwith \u03b3 = 0 for an exponential, 1 for a Maxwellian, and\n\u03b3 \u2265 2, for a modified power-law spectrum. Actually,\nboth the exponential and Maxwellian spectra come from\nMaxwellian velocity distributions. The plain exponential\ncomes from an uni-directional Maxwellian distribution for\nparticles with very narrow pitch-angle dispersion, while\nthe so-called Maxwellian spectrum is associated with an\nisotropic Maxwellian distribution. Maxwellian and modi-\nfied power law spectra are suggestive of an electron pop-\nulation that has been accelerated long before precipitation\ntakes place. The modified power-law spectrum is not the\ndirect output of a physical process, but a representation of\nthe simultaneous stretching and widening of the tail of the\nMaxwellian distribution during the acceleration processes.\nOn the other hand, particle acceleration along the field lines\ntakes place after precipitation and is signalled by the pres-\nence of bumps in the spectrum and associated with drifting\nMaxwellians (Rostoker et al., 1985).\nEo is the characteristic energy and gives the energy of the\nprecipitating electrons at the top of the ionosphere. The char-\nacteristic energy can be determined from the flux at two en-\nergy bands E1 > E2\nEo = (E1 \u2212 E2) log\n[\n(E1\/E2)\n\u03b3F(E2)\/F (E1)\n]\n. (2)\nIf the spectrum is represented by a distribution from\nEq. (1), then the flux-averaged energy, \u3008E\u3009, gives a good es-\ntimate of the characteristic energy when integrating over the\nfull spectrum or between energy bands EA and EB , such that\nEB \u001d Eo\u001d EA:\n\u3008E\u3009 = 6iEiF(Ei)\/6kF(Ek) \u223c (\u03b3 + 1)Eo . (3)\nWe may define a \u201cmixed\u201d spectrum, approaching an expo-\nnential at the lower energies and a modified power-law dis-\ntribution at the higher energies, with some kind of energy\n\u201cthreshold\u201d, EC(> Eo), separating these two regimes:\nF(E) = Ao exp(\u2212E\/Eo) for E < EC , (4a)\nF(E) = Ao(E\/EC)\u03b3 exp(\u2212E\/Eo) for E > EC . (4b)\nEnergy EC may be a function of Eo, the pitch angle, etc.,\nand may even change with time and the geomagnetic distur-\nbance level. In any case, for this mixed spectrum, we also\nhave that \u3008E\u3009 \u223c Eo, because the determination of the to-\ntal flux and the flux-averaged energy are dominated by the\nexponential side of the spectrum. We will see in Sect. 3\nthat most of the estimated flux in our observations is con-\ncentrated at the lower energies where is closely represented\nby an exponential distribution. At the higher energies, on the\nother hand, we have more flux than in the full exponential\nspectrum, and the spectral shape may be better approximated\nby the Maxwellian or the modified power-law distributions.\nThis means that a mixed distribution (or rather a smoother\nC.

The proportionality factors\nK1 and K2 may change at time scales much larger than\nthe ion recombination time and, therefore, very slowly com-\npared to the rapid changes in particle flux and characteris-\ntic energy. At the shorter time scales, changes in electron\ndensity are directly related to changes in the precipitation\nflux. These last two equations correct the derivations pre-\nsented by Kosch et al. (2001; their Eqs. 10 and 11). Ac-\ntually, the absorption (Abs) is basically proportional to the\nelectron density at a relatively narrow height range centred at\nzA [Abs(t) \u221d Ne(zA, t)], and for corresponding deposition\nenergy EA of the precipitating electrons. At these heights,\nthe ion production rate is proportional to the square of the\nelectron density, and the production rate is in its turn, pro-\nportional to the precipitation flux F(EA) (or, equivalently,\nF(EA, t) \u221d Q(zA, t) \u223c \u03b1eff(zA)Ne(zA, t)2, \u03b1eff(z) is the\neffective ion recombination rate). The optical intensity (Int)\nis, on the other hand, basically proportional to the produc-\ntion rate at also a relatively narrow height range centred at zI\nwith corresponding energy EI (then, Int(zI , t) \u221d Q(zI , t) \u221d\nF(EI , t)).\n2 Experimental data\nThe data discussed in this study were obtained during three\nperiods of simultaneous winter nighttime observations with\nthe EISCAT, IRIS and DASI systems:\n(1) 17:00\u201301:00 UT on 13\u201314 February 1996,\n(2) 15:30\u201322:00 UT on 9 November 1998, and\n1352 C.

We have con-\nsidered an initial time resolution of 10 s for EISCAT, IRIS\nand DASI data, and then we post-integrate to a 1 min. res-\nolution. In all cases, the EISCAT UHF antenna was kept\npointing along the magnetic field line at Troms\u00f8. The in-\nversion algorithm to estimate the energy-flux spectrum from\nthe radar observations was applied at these two resolutions.\nHowever, given the large amount of data points and the vari-\nous types of calculations performed, we restrict our analysis\nto a common resolution of 1 min for all data sets.\nFigure 1 shows the summary plots of the IRIS and DASI\ndata for these three observation periods. It displays together\nthe keograms at 19.25\u25e6 lon. (\u223cTroms\u00f8) of absorption and op-\ntical intensity (at 557.7 nm). Colour bars on the bottom give\nthe absorption in dB (to the left) and the green-light inten-\nsity in kRayleighs (kR, to the right). The close coincidence\nbetween maximum intensities indicates the presence of sub-\nstorm activity within the common field of view, and this is\nparticularly true on 13\u201314 February 1996, and to a lesser ex-\ntent on 12 February 1998. In the other cases, the optical ac-\ntivity was more intense to the north, such as during 9 Novem-\nber 1998. The brightest aurora occurred during 9 November\n1998, with maximum green-line intensity of 32 kR, but be-\ncause it fell mostly outside the IRIS field of view, the ab-\nsorption is low, particularly before 20:00 UT. The maximum\nintensity at the longitude of Troms\u00f8 during 13\u201314 February\n1996 was 7 kR, and during 12 February 1999 was 16 kR.\nFigure 2, on the other hand, shows the raw electron density\nmeasured by EISCAT in the 70\u2013130 km range and the corre-\nsponding electron precipitation flux (the differential flux, per\nkeV, per cm2, per second and per ster-radian) from the in-\nversion of the electron density profiles for the observing pe-\nriod 12 February 1999, 17:00\u201321:51 UT.

As you\nmay see from the figure, the electron densities are above this\nvalue for heights greater than 75 km and for corresponding\nflux-spectrum energies smaller than 200 keV. The energy-\nflux spectrum is estimated by the inversion of the electron\ndensity profile in the height range 70\u2013140 km, over 28 en-\nergy bands in the range 1\u2013320 keV, the effective deposition\nheight, h, for precipitating electrons can be related to their\nenergy by E(h) = 4 \u00d7 105 exp(\u22120.101 h) (see, del Pozo et\nal., 1997; Kosch et al., 2001).\n3 Discussion\nThe results and the heuristic arguments presented in Kosch\net al. (2001) and in this study show the presence of a gener-\nally good linear correlation between the particle fluxes and\nthe optical emission and absorption, at the two correspond-\ning height ranges and energy bands for the precipitating elec-\ntrons. This correlation also justifies the relatively good linear\nregression between the logarithm of the ratio of the average\nfluxes, at the two height ranges, and the logarithm of the ratio\nof the optical intensity to the absorption measured at Troms\u00f8,\nand it allows the estimation of the characteristic energy of\nthe precipitating electrons. Kosch et al. (2001) simply com-\nbined the 13 February 1996 and 9 November 1998 data sets.\nHere we analyze the individual data sets (including the ad-\nditional period in 12 February 1999) and then all together to\nsee whether determining Eo from the absorption and optical\nintensity is consistent over time. We are also investigating\nif a physical parameter, such as the flux-averaged energy \u2013\ndirectly derived from the EISCAT measurements \u2013 can be\nemployed as a reference for, and to further qualify, our de-\nterminations of the characteristic energy and help us decide\nwhich type of spectral distribution (given by Eq. 1 or Eq. 4)\nmay better represent the energy-flux spectrum from the mea-\nsurements.\nFigure 3 presents the dispersion plots for the fluxes, ab-\nsorption and optical intensity for the three data sets (frames\n(a), (b), and (c)) at Troms\u00f8; the choice of a log-log scale is\nonly a matter of convenience. The y-axis displays, in the\nupper panels the log of the square of absorption and in the\nbottom panels the logarithm of the 557.7 nm intensity. The\nx-axis displays, in all cases, the logarithm of the electron\nflux at the corresponding height\/energy ranges. Flux1 and\nflux2 are averages over the height ranges 108\u2013120 km and\n85\u201395 km, respectively, with corresponding energy ranges 2\u2013\n7 keV and 27\u201375 keV. The calculated correlation coefficients,\nfrom Fig. 3, between Flux F1 and Abs2, and between Flux\nF2 and Int (the green-light intensity) are: 0.64 and 0.51 (with\n480 data points) for the 13\u201314 February 1996 data, 0.72 and\n0.80 (with 300 data points) for the 9 November 1998 data,\nand 0.34 and 0.86 (with 300 data points) for the 12 Febru-\nary 1999 data. Given the large size of the samples in all three\nperiods, the actual populations\u2019 correlation coefficient are in-\ndeed greater than their sample estimates.\nFigure 4 gives the dispersion plots between the logarithm\nof the ratio of the optical intensity to the square of the ab-\nsorption and the logarithm of the ratio of the corresponding\nfluxes. Frames (a), (b), and (c) correspond to the same data\nsets as Fig. 3, and frame (d) displays all the data points to-\ngether. Remember that for spectral distributions of the type\ngiven in Eq. (1) (and in Eq. (4) as well), the characteristic\nenergy is inversely proportional to the log of the ratio F2\/F1\n(Eq. 2). The regression lines are shown in red on the disper-\nsion plots, the dotted lines on both sides and in all cases give\none standard deviation intervals for the linear regression. The\nregression line is given by:\nlog(Int\/Abs2) \u223c a + b log(F2\/F1) . (7)\nFlux F1 in energy band E1 is responsible for most of the\nabsorption (Abs) recorded by IRIS, while flux F2 in the band\nE2 causes most of the green-light emission (Int). E1 and\nE2 are, in fact, the flux-averaged deposition energies over\nthe height ranges 85\u201395 km and 108\u2013120 km, respectively,\nand equal to 37.5 keV and 2.72 keV in 13\u201314 February 1996;\nequal to 33.6 keV and 2.85 keV in 9 November 1998; and\nequal to 38.9 keV and 3.05 keV in 12 February 1999. We are\nconsidering fixed values E1 = 40 keV and E2 = 3 keV in all\nour calculations, and thus assuming that the energy\/height\nrange at which most of the absorption and green-line emis-\nsion takes place changes little during the length of the obser-\nvation periods. This assumption seems justified a posteriori\nby the good correlation between these parameters and the\nEISCAT electron density profiles or, equivalently, the elec-\ntron fluxes at the corresponding height ranges. Moreover,\ndue to the significant linear correlation between F1 and Abs2,\nand F2 and Int, we could expect a similar dependence be-\ntween the Eo and log(Int\/Abs2), in the case where the shape\nof the spectrum between energies E1 and E2 can be approx-\nimated by either an exponential, a Maxwellian or a modi-\nfied power-law distribution, or by the \u201cmixed\u201d distribution in\nEq. (4). We may have,\nlog(Int\/Abs2) \u223c a\u2032 + b(E1 \u2212 E2)\/Eo . (8)\nThe value of a\u2032 is obtained from, a, in Eq. (7) by a\u2032 =\na \u2212 b log(E1\/E2)\u03b3 or, for a mixed distribution, a\u2032 = a \u2212\nb log(E1\/EC)\u03b3 . In this paper we have assumed a fixed value\nof EC = 25 keV, considering the fact that up to 20 keV the\nshape of the flux spectrum may be reasonably represented by\nan exponential distribution (see Fig. 5a). Moreover, optical\nemissions occur above 100 km and result from precipitating\nelectrons with energies smaller than 15 keV, and riometer ab-\nsorption normally occurs below 95 km for energies greater\nthan 25 keV.\nParameters a and b from the linear regressions are: a =\n7.24, b = 0.33 for 13\u201314 February 1996, a = 7.57, b = 0.45\nfor 9 November 1998, a = 6.97, b = 0.34 for 12 February\n1999 and, for all data points together, a = 7.71, b = 0.29. In\nall cases, most points fall within one standard deviation from\nthe regression line with a 99% confidence interval. Notice\nthat Eo is proportional to the logarithm of the fluxes and to\n1354 C.

In all cases, the x-axis gives the logarithm of\nthe flux at the corresponding height\/energy range.\nthe logarithm of (Int\/Abs2); thus, the dispersion among pa-\nrameters a and b \u2013 and in fact in Eo \u2013 is not too large, with\nthe worst case being on 9 November 1998. During this pe-\nriod, we observed the brightest aurora, but most of the time it\nwas slightly north of the IRIS field of view. The fact that the\nlinear regressions are essentially the same for different data\nsets is proof that this technique of estimating Eo from Abs\nand Int can be applied to any IRIS and DASI data set pair\nwithout the assistance of EISCAT data.\nFigures 5 and 6 display various characteristic energies es-\ntimated from different spectral distributions employing the\nratio of fluxes (F2\/F1), and those estimates for similar con-\nditions, but making use of the ratio (Int\/Abs2) of the opti-\ncal intensity to the square of the absorption. We are com-\nparing the flux-averaged energy, \u3008E\u3009, with the characteris-\ntic energies, Eo, for various spectral distributions between\nenergies E1 and E2 . We consider exponential and mixed\ndistributions of first (exponential\/Maxwellian) and second\n(exponential\/power-2) orders. If the flux spectrum were well\nrepresented by any of these distributions, then \u3008E\u3009 \u223c Eo.\nWe are also including the determinations of Eo, consider-\ning full Maxwellian and full power-2 distributions for com-\nparison purposes. In all figures, the top panel corresponds\nto the 13\u201314 February 1996 period (a), the middle panel to\nthe 9 November 1998 period (b), and the bottom panel to\nthe 12 February 1999 period (c). As a reference and to fa-\ncilitate the comparisons, we are including in all figures the\nflux-averaged energy \u3008E\u3009 (in black) determined by integrat-\ning over the spectrum in the range 1\u2013200 keV, for all periods\nand all times. As mentioned in the introduction, for the ex-\nponential and mixed distributions, we have \u3008E\u3009 \u223c Eo.\nFigure 5 also includes the values of Eo estimated from\nEq. (2), assuming two exponential distributions, one in\nheight range 98\u2013120 km (in green, E1 = 20 keV and E2 =\n2 keV) and the other in height range 89\u2013117 km (in blue,\nE1 = 40 keV and E2 = 3 keV). The red curve gives the\nvalues of Eo obtained by applying Eq. (8) for an exponen-\ntial distribution. The corresponding exponential calculations\n(the red and blue curves) generally follow each other closely.\nThe generally good correspondence between the black and\ngreen curves in all panels in Fig. 5 (and particularly at the\ntop and bottom panels) shows that the flux-averaged energy\nC.

Panel (d) displays all the data\npoints together. The regression lines are shown in red while the dotted lines on both sides give the interval at one standard deviation.\n\u3008E\u3009 is well represented by the characteristic energy Eo from\nan exponential spectrum in the 98\u2013120 km range. This indi-\ncates that most of the flux is concentrated at the lower energy\nside of the spectrum and the spectral shape is closely expo-\nnential at these energies. On the other hand, the estimate\nof Eo from an exponential distribution over the full energy\nrange (blue curve) is systematically greater than \u3008E\u3009, which\nmeans that the flux at higher energies is stronger than in the\nexponential approximation. This is evidence of the presence\nof acceleration processes and the fact that a Maxwellian or\neven a modified power-law spectrum may give a better rep-\nresentation of the higher energy fluxes (see Fig. 6a).\nFigures 6a and b display together the Eo estimates by con-\nsidering two mixed distributions, an exponential\/Maxwellian\n(blue curve) and an exponential\/power-2 (red curve); the ma-\ngenta and green curves show Eo for, respectively, a full\nMaxwellian distribution and a full power-2 distribution. Fig-\nure 6a employs the ratio (F2\/F1) at energies E1 = 40 keV\nand E2 = 3 keV (actually the fluxes are averaged over the\ncorresponding height ranges 85\u201395 km and 108\u2013120 km) and\nFig. 6b data from ratio (Int\/Abs2) at the assumed similar\nheight ranges. The black curve in all frames is the flux-\naveraged energy \u3008E\u3009. The determinations employing ratio\n(F2\/F1) are very sensitive to small or noisy values of the\nhigher energy flux F1 and, hence, errors can be greatly am-\nplified. This is also true for the ratio (Int\/Abs2) for low or\nnoisy values of the absorption. The apparent overflows in\nFig. 6b around 19:00 UT and 19:30 UT in period (a), and\naround 18:20 UT and 18:30 UT in period (b) may be associ-\nated with particularly bad values of the absorption (in Fig. 1).\nIn both Figs. 6a and b and in periods (b) and (c), the es-\ntimates of Eo from the mixed distributions (blue and red\ncurves) appear to follow \u3008E\u3009 (black curve) closer than in pe-\nriod (a), and also generally closer than the full Maxwellian\nand full power-2 estimates (magenta and green curves), par-\nticularly for period (c). Eo, from the full Maxwellian and\nfull power-2 distributions, corresponds with mixed distribu-\ntion estimates but at a much smaller energy \u201cthreshold\u201d E2.\nThis means that \u3008E\u3009 could be better represented by lower-\ning the energy threshold EC , particularly in period (a). This,\nhowever, does not seem to be justified by any physical con-\nsideration, and we should conclude that the flux spectrum, at\nleast in this case, could not be represented by a simple an-\nalytical distribution.

The red curve gives the values of Eo from log(Int\/Abs2) for an exponential\ndistribution.\nand one by one at all the spectra and determine how close\nthey follow a given distribution in the energy range (E1, E2).\nFrom the results of the linear regression and Eqs. (7) and\n(8), parameter 1\/log(Int\/Abs2) is, therefore, a good indicator\nof the characteristic energy over the common field of view of\nIRIS and DASI, and will allow for the determination of \u201cen-\nergy maps\u201d of the electron precipitation evolving in time. We\nare presenting in Fig. 7 two examples of such energy maps:\n(a) at 20:42 UT (\u223c 23:00 LT) on 13 February 1996, and (b) at\n20:24 UT (\u223c 22:45 LT) on 9 November 1998. We will not go\ninto any detail on the structure of the \u201cenergy maps\u201d; we re-\nfer to Kosch et al. (2001) for complementary information and\ndiscussion. These characteristic energy maps were calcu-\nlated from the log (Int\/Abs2) in the common field of view by\nextrapolating the results of the linear regressions (in Fig. 4,\nand Eq. 8) for a mixed Exponential\/Maxwellian distribution.\nThe figure shows in the top panel the absorption map from\nIRIS and in the middle panel the optical intensity map from\nDASI. The bottom panel shows the energy map. The colour\nbars on the right-hand side are given, respectively, in dB (top)\nfor the absorption, in kR (middle) for the optical intensity,\nand in keV (bottom) for the characteristic energy. Optical\nsignatures of arcs are generally more evenly distributed in\nspace, being narrow and elongated along the L-shells, while\nthe absorption regions appear more structured and patchy, al-\nthough globally aligned with the arcs.\nFigure 7a shows a well-defined, slowly varying quiet-time\narc, while the auroral form in Fig. 7b is associated with fold-\ning and spiral formation in a disturbed-time arc structure.\nAbsorption regions extend south of the optical signatures\nwhich seems to indicate that energetic electrons responsible\nfor the absorption reach deeper into the inner magnetosphere\nbeing accelerated and dispersed before precipitation. The\ntime shown in Fig. 7a is also shown in Kosch et al.

The colour bars on the right-hand side are, respectively, in dB\n(top), in kR (middle), and in keV (bottom).\nerally good linear correlation between the particle fluxes and\nthe optical emission and absorption, at the two height ranges\nwhere most of the optical emission (557.7 nm) and the ab-\nsorption take place. This paper also corrects the deriva-\ntions and results shown in Kosch et al. (2001); they made\na mistake by comparing the characteristic energy Eo with\nlog(Int0.5\/Abs). This mistake did indeed propagate to their\nresults, but fortunately because the characteristic energy Eo\nis proportional to log (Int\/Abs2), and not to log (Int0.5\/Abs)\nas they wrongly stated, the structure of their \u201cenergy maps\u201d\nwas not affected but only the energy levels by a linear factor\nof the order of 2.\nOptical intensity and absorption compare very well with\naverage fluxes at 85\u201395 km height range (or 30\u201370 keV en-\nergy range) and at 108\u2013120 km height range (or 2\u20137 keV en-\nergy range), respectively. We have analysed three data sets of\nsimultaneous observations by the EISCAT, IRIS and DASI\ninstruments, in period (a) 13 February 1996, in period (b)\n9 November 1998, and in period (c) 12 February 1999. The\nenergy-flux spectrum was calculated from the \u201cinversion\u201d of\nthe EISCAT electron density profiles. The results also show\nthe generally good linear dependence between the logarithm\nof the ratio of the average fluxes, at the corresponding energy\nbands, and the logarithm of the ratio of the optical intensity\nto the absorption measured at Troms\u00f8. This makes possible,\nin principle, to estimate the characteristic energy of the pre-\ncipitating electrons and to determine the \u201cenergy map\u201d of the\nprecipitation over the common field of view of the IRIS and\nDASI instruments. We have also tried to see if a physical pa-\nrameter, such as the flux-averaged energy \u2013 directly derived\nfrom the EISCAT measurements \u2013 can be employed both as\na reference for, and to further qualify, our determinations of\nthe characteristic energy, thus, helping us to decide which\ntype of spectral distribution (given by Eq. 1 or Eq. 4) may\ngive a better representation of the energy-flux spectrum.\nInvestigating the individual data sets of Kosch et al. (2001)\n(13 February 1996 and 9 November 1998), as well as another\ndata set (12 February 1999) shows that the linear regression\nC. F. del Pozo et al.: Estimation of the characteristic energy of electron precipitation 1359\nis essentially the same for all cases. Hence, it is possible\nto use IRIS and DASI data to estimate the characteristic en-\nergy Eo, even when EISCAT radar data is unavailable. We\nhave, on the other hand, only partly succeeded in our at-\ntempt to give a more physical basis to the estimation of the\ncharacteristic energy Eo by trying to define a reference, the\nflux-averaged energy \u3008E\u3009, directly derived from the EISCAT\nmeasurements, and to justify the choice or one or another\ntype of spectral distribution that may better represent the ob-\nservations. Our results show that the spectrum of precipi-\ntation is closely exponential in the 98\u2013120 km height range,\nwhile at lower heights and higher energies it may follow a\nMaxwellian or modified power-law distribution. Therefore, a\n\u201cmixed\u201d distribution, combining an exponential spectrum at\nthe lower energies with a Maxwellian, or even a higher order\npower-law spectrum at the higher energies, may give a better\nrepresentation of the characteristic energy and the spectral\nshape than a single exponential dependence for the full spec-\ntrum. Our analysis has underlined the exponential and mixed\ndistributions of first (exponential\/Maxwellian) and second\n(exponential\/power-2) orders. A \u201cmixed\u201d distribution should\nbe a function of some \u201cthreshold\u201d energy EC defining some\ntransition between narrow and broad pitch-angle scattering,\nand that may even depend on Eo, and change with time and\nthe geomagnetic disturbance level. In this paper we have as-\nsumed a fixed value of EC = 25 keV, considering the fact\nthat up to 20 keV the shape of the flux spectrum could be\nreasonably represented by an exponential distribution.\nMoreover, if the energy-flux spectrum were well repre-\nsented by any of the distributions in Eq. (4), then the flux-\naveraged energy will closely approximate the characteristic\nenergy of the spectrum (thus, \u3008E\u3009 \u223c Eo). For the corre-\nsponding \u201cplain\u201d distributions in Eq. (1), \u3008E\u3009 is two, three\ntimes, etc., greater than Eo. In periods (b) and (c), the es-\ntimates of Eo from the mixed distributions appear to follow\n\u3008E\u3009 closer than in period (a), and also generally closer than\nthe full Maxwellian and full power-2 estimates, particularly\nfor period (c). Eo, from the full Maxwellian and full power-2\ndistributions, corresponds with mixed distribution estimates\nbut at a much smaller energy \u201cthreshold\u201d E2. This means\nthat \u3008E\u3009 could be better represented by lowering the energy\nthreshold EC , particularly in period (a). This, however, does\nnot seem to be justified by any physical consideration and we\nshould conclude that the flux spectrum, at least in this case,\ncould not be represented by a simple analytical distribution.\nWe leave the task of determining a more precise value (or\nvalues) for energy EC to a follow-up study. It may indeed be\npossible to estimate this energy by looking at all individual\nspectra and systematically fitting \u2013 by a least mean square\ntechnique \u2013 the \u201cmixed\u201d spectral shapes given by Eq. (4).\nThis kind of analysis will also help to establish the best av-\nerage spectral shape in energy range (E1, E2), closely repre-\nsenting the energy-flux spectrum in various conditions.\nAcknowledgements.
