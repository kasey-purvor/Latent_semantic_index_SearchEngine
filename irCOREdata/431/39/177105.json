Data sources: Electronic databases and relevant websites from 1990 to May 2007 were searched. Review methods: This review was based on a systematic review conducted by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), supplemented by evidence from any additional studies identified. Comparator interventions for effectiveness were standard care, pulmonary artery catheters (PACs), pulse contour analysis monitoring and lithium or thermodilution cardiac monitoring. Data were extracted on mortality, length of stay overall and in critical care, complications and quality of life. The economic assessment evaluated strategies involving ODM compared with standard care, PACs, pulse contour analysis monitoring and lithium or thermodilution cardiac monitoring. Results: The AHRQ report contained eight RCTs and was judged to be of high quality overall. Four comparisons were reported: ODM plus central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring plus conventional assessment vs CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment\\ud\nduring surgery; ODM plus conventional assessment vs CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment during surgery; ODM plus conventional assessment vs conventional assessment during surgery; and ODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment vs CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment postoperatively. Five studies compared ODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment with CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment during surgery. There were fewer deaths [Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.13, 95% CI 0.02\u20130.96], fewer major complications (Peto OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04\u20130.31), fewer total complications (fixed-effects OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26\u20130.71) and shorter length of stay (pooled estimate not presented, 95% CI \u20132.21 to \u20130.57) in the ODM group. The results of the meta analysis of mortality should be treated with caution owing to the low number of events and low overall number of patients in the combined totals. Three studies compared ODM plus conventional assessment with conventional assessment during surgery. There was no evidence of a difference in mortality (fixed-effects OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23\u20132.77). Length of hospital stay was shorter in all three studies in the ODM group. Two studies compared ODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment vs CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment in critically ill patients. The patient groups were quite different (cardiac surgery and major trauma) and neither study, nor a meta-analysis, showed a statistically significant difference in mortality (fixed-effects OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41\u20131.70). Fewer patients in the ODM group experienced complications (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30\u20130.81) and both studies reported a statistically significant shorter median length of hospital stay in that group. No economic evaluations that met the inclusion criteria were identified from the existing literature so a series of balance sheets was constructed.

Data sources: Electronic databases and relevant websites from 1990 to May 2007 were searched. Review methods: This review was based on a systematic review conducted by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), supplemented by evidence from any additional studies identified. Comparator interventions for effectiveness were standard care, pulmonary artery catheters (PACs), pulse contour analysis monitoring and lithium or thermodilution cardiac monitoring. Data were extracted on mortality, length of stay overall and in critical care, complications and quality of life. The economic assessment evaluated strategies involving ODM compared with standard care, PACs, pulse contour analysis monitoring and lithium or thermodilution cardiac monitoring. Results: The AHRQ report contained eight RCTs and was judged to be of high quality overall. Four comparisons were reported: ODM plus central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring plus conventional assessment vs CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment\\ud\nduring surgery; ODM plus conventional assessment vs CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment during surgery; ODM plus conventional assessment vs conventional assessment during surgery; and ODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment vs CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment postoperatively. Five studies compared ODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment with CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment during surgery. There were fewer deaths [Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.13, 95% CI 0.02\u20130.96], fewer major complications (Peto OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04\u20130.31), fewer total complications (fixed-effects OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26\u20130.71) and shorter length of stay (pooled estimate not presented, 95% CI \u20132.21 to \u20130.57) in the ODM group. The results of the meta analysis of mortality should be treated with caution owing to the low number of events and low overall number of patients in the combined totals. Three studies compared ODM plus conventional assessment with conventional assessment during surgery. There was no evidence of a difference in mortality (fixed-effects OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23\u20132.77). Length of hospital stay was shorter in all three studies in the ODM group. Two studies compared ODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment vs CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment in critically ill patients. The patient groups were quite different (cardiac surgery and major trauma) and neither study, nor a meta-analysis, showed a statistically significant difference in mortality (fixed-effects OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41\u20131.70). Fewer patients in the ODM group experienced complications (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30\u20130.81) and both studies reported a statistically significant shorter median length of hospital stay in that group. No economic evaluations that met the inclusion criteria were identified from the existing literature so a series of balance sheets was constructed. The results show that ODM strategies are likely to be cost-effective. Conclusions: More formal economic evaluation would allow better use of the available data. All identified studies were conducted in unconscious patients. However, further research is needed to evaluate new ODM probes that may be tolerated by awake patients. Given the paucity of the existing economic evidence base, any further primary research should include an economic evaluation or should provide data suitable for use in an economic model.<\/dc:description><dc:description>\nThe Health Services Research Unit and the Health Economics Research Unit are both core funded by the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health Directorate.<\/dc:description><dc:description>\nPeer reviewed<\/dc:description><dc:description>\nPublisher PDF<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n2009-04-07T10:15:29Z<\/dc:date><dc:date>\n2009-04-07T10:15:29Z<\/dc:date><dc:date>\n2009-01<\/dc:date><dc:type>\nJournal Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\nText<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>\nMowatt, G., Houston, G., Hernandez, R., de Vertuil, R., Fraser, C., Cuthbertson, B., and Vale, L.

It produces high-quality research information on the \neffectiveness, costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care \nin the NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health, prevent \nand treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care.\nThe research findings from the HTA Programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the \nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee \n(NSC). HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that they \nform a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019.\nThe HTA Programme is needs led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are three \nroutes to the start of projects.\nFirst is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the \nNHS, from the public and consumer groups and from professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS \ntrusts. These suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service \nusers). The HTA Programme then commissions the research by competitive tender.\nSecond, the HTA Programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research \nquestions. These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.\nThird, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA Programme \ncommissions bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring together \nevidence on the value of specific technologies.\nSome HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They \ncan cost from as little as \u00a340,000 to over \u00a31 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence, \nundertaking a trial, or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem.\nThe final reports from HTA projects are peer reviewed by a number of independent expert referees before \npublication in the widely read journal series Health Technology Assessment.\nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA journal series\nReports are published in the HTA journal series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA \nProgramme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and \neditors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search, appraisal \nand synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication \nof the review by others.\nThe research reported in this issue of the journal was commissioned and funded by the HTA Programme \non behalf of NICE as project number 07\/20\/01. The protocol was agreed in April 2007. The assessment \nreport began editorial review in August 2007 and was accepted for publication in June 2008.

This information is combined with an \nestimate of aortic cross-sectional area (derived from \na nomogram based on the patient\u2019s age, height \nand weight) allowing continuous monitoring of \ncardiac output and haemodynamic status. ODM is \na relatively simple procedure, generally limited in \nuse to a critical care or theatre setting, that requires \nno calibration and minimal training.\nEpidemiology and \nbackground\nOptimal management of cardiac output, fluid \nbalance and haemodynamic status is considered \nkey to improving outcome in high-risk surgical \nand critically ill patients. Traditionally, pulmonary \nartery catheters (PACs) have been used to monitor \ncardiac output and haemodynamic status to guide \ntreatment, but they have been shown to provide no \nbenefit to this patient group.\nLess invasive methods of monitoring cardiac output \nand other haemodynamic variables include ODM, \ntransoesophageal echocardiography, transthoracic \nimpedance, carbon dioxide elimination and \nsystems based upon pulse contour analysis and dye \ndilution methods. These may be used alongside \nconventional clinical assessment which involves \nassessment of various clinical markers, e.g. heart \nrate, systolic blood pressure and urinary output, \nwith or without a measure of blood flow or central \nvenous pressure.\nObjective\nTo assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness \nof ODM, in comparison with conventional clinical \nassessment and other methods of monitoring \ncardiovascular function.\nExecutive summary\nMethods\nA systematic review of studies of effectiveness and \ncost-effectiveness was conducted.\nData sources\nSearches of electronic databases [including \nMEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to \nNursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) \nand the Cochrane Library] and relevant websites \nuntil May 2007 were undertaken to identify \npublished and unpublished reports, including \nprevious systematic reviews.\nStudy selection\nFor the review of effectiveness, randomised \ncontrolled trials (RCTs), or systematic reviews \nof RCTs, assessing the effects of ODM in the \ntarget populations were identified. Comparator \ninterventions considered were standard care, PACs, \npulse contour analysis monitoring and lithium or \nthermodilution cardiac monitoring. Non-English \nlanguage studies and studies reported only as \nabstracts were excluded.\nFor the review of economic evaluations studies had \nto compare, in terms of both costs and outcomes, \nstrategies involving ODM compared with standard \ncare, PACs, pulse contour analysis monitoring and \nlithium or thermodilution cardiac monitoring. \nNo language restrictions or other limitations to \nsearches were imposed.\nData extraction\nFor the review of effectiveness a recent high-quality \nsystematic review, conducted by the US Agency \nfor Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), \nwas identified. A judgement was made to base this \nreview on this study, supplemented by evidence \nfrom any additional studies identified. Data were \nextracted on mortality, length of stay overall and in \ncritical care, complications and quality of life.\nThe quality of primary studies was assessed using \nthe Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) Executive summary\nx\n25-question quality scale. The systematic review \nwas assessed using a 10-item checklist developed \nby Oxman and Guyatt. Where appropriate, meta-\nanalysis was employed to estimate a summary \nmeasure of effect on relevant outcomes. Where \na quantitative synthesis was considered to be \ninappropriate or not feasible, a narrative synthesis \nof results was provided.\nEconomic modelling\nPartial economic modelling exercises were explored \nfor pairwise comparisons between strategies that \nused ODM and those that did not. Differences in \nmortality and length of stay were considered within \nthese exercises. Where data allowed, probability \ndistributions were attached to model parameters \n[e.g. lognormal probability distributions for \nodds ratios and normal distributions for length \nof hospital stay differences using information \non the confidence intervals (CIs) surrounding \npoint estimates], and probabilistic analyses were \nconducted. Costs were stated in \u00a3 sterling for \n2006\u20137. Cost-effectiveness results were expressed in \nadditional cost per additional quality-adjusted life-\nyear (QALY), as well as the average extra cost per \nadditional survivor that would need to be incurred \nbefore ODM would no longer be considered cost-\neffective. For the former the results were presented \nin the form of incremental cost-effectiveness planes \nand for the latter the data were presented as \nhistograms.\nResults\nNumber and quality of studies \nand direction of evidence\nThe AHRQ report contained eight RCTs involving \n757 adult patients. Two additional RCTs, involving \n202 patients, were identified. Eight of these \nprimary studies were judged to be of high quality \nand two were judged to be of moderate quality. \nThe AHRQ report was judged to be of high quality \noverall. The 10 primary studies reported four \ncomparisons (one study reported two):\nODM plus central venous pressure (CVP)  \u2022\t\nmonitoring plus conventional assessment \nversus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nassessment during surgery\nODM plus conventional assessment versus  \u2022\t\nCVP monitoring plus conventional assessment \nduring surgery\nODM plus conventional assessment versus  \u2022\t\nconventional assessment during surgery\nODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional  \u2022\t\nassessment versus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional assessment in critically ill patients \npostoperatively.\nFor the review of cost-effectiveness no studies were \nidentified and as a consequence the data from the \nreview of effectiveness were organised into a series \nof balance sheets.\nSummary of benefits\nDuring surgery\nFive studies (453 patients) compared ODM plus \nCVP monitoring plus conventional assessment \nwith CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment \nduring surgery. There were fewer deaths [Peto odds \nratio (OR) 0.13, 95% CI 0.02\u20130.96], fewer major \ncomplications (Peto OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04\u20130.31), \nfewer total complications (fixed-effects OR 0.43, \n95% CI 0.26\u20130.71) and shorter length of stay \n(pooled estimate not presented, 95% CI \u20132.21 to \n\u20130.57) in the ODM group. These analyses included \na study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the \nresults of which were consistent with those from \nthe other four studies. The results of the meta-\nanalysis of mortality should be treated with caution \nowing to the low number of events and low overall \nnumber of patients in the combined totals.\nOne study (61 patients) compared ODM plus \nconventional assessment with CVP monitoring \nplus conventional assessment during surgery. \nConfidence intervals for differences in mortality, \ntotal complications and length of hospital stay \nwere wide enough to include clinically important \ndifferences favouring either intervention.\nThree studies (139 patients) compared ODM \nplus conventional assessment with conventional \nassessment during surgery. There was no evidence \nof a difference in mortality (fixed-effects OR 0.81, \n95% CI 0.23\u20132.77). No data were available on \nmajor complications. One study reported total \ncomplications, with fewer in the ODM group (OR \n0.23, 95% CI 0.07\u20130.72) but no fewer patients \nexperiencing complications (OR 0.41, 95% CI \n0.14\u20131.16). Length of hospital stay was shorter in \nall three studies in the ODM group.\nCritically ill patients\nTwo studies (366 patients) compared ODM plus \nCVP monitoring plus conventional assessment \nversus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nassessment.

No data were available \nfor major complications but fewer patients in the \nODM group experienced complications (OR 0.49, \n95% CI 0.30\u20130.81) and both studies reported a \nstatistically significant shorter median length of \nhospital stay in the ODM group.\nNo evidence was available on quality of life and \nfive studies reported the outcome of ODM-related \ncomplications, with all stating that none occurred.\nCosts\nNo studies reporting costs were identified. The \naddition of ODM would incur the cost of a monitor \n(approximately \u00a310,000) which will last several \nyears and typically a single disposable probe per \npatient (approximately \u00a360\u2013\u00a3120). In addition, \nmaintenance contracts might be necessary \n(approximately \u00a3550). Apart from the few minutes \nrequired to insert the probe there are few other \nadditional costs. Any changes in length of stay, \ncomplications and mortality would also affect total \ncosts.\nCost-effectiveness\nNo economic evaluations that met inclusion \ncriteria were identified from the existing literature \nand a series of balance sheets were constructed \nto highlight the choices and trade-offs that \nmay exist. For ODM plus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional assessment versus CVP monitoring \nplus conventional assessment during surgery, the \nODM strategy is likely to be more effective and the \ncosts of ODM are likely to be offset by reductions \nin length of stay and complications. However, the \ncost of interventions prompted by monitoring \n(intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs, etc.) is \nnot known. For ODM plus conventional assessment \nversus conventional assessment during surgery, \nit is likely that the costs of ODM will be offset by \nthe reductions in length of stay, but the overall \ndifferences in costs and effectiveness are unclear \nas there is insufficient evidence on mortality \nand complications. For ODM plus conventional \nassessment versus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional assessment during surgery, there is \ninsufficient evidence available and where data are \navailable the confidence intervals are sufficiently \nwide to cover clinically and economically important \ndifferences favouring either intervention. In \ncritically ill patients the cost of ODM appeared \nto be compensated for by differences in length of \nstay and its use may reduce complications, but the \neffect on mortality and on the cost of interventions \nprompted by monitoring is unclear.\nA partial economic modelling exercise was \nconducted for ODM plus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment versus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \nand ODM plus conventional clinical assessment \nversus conventional clinical assessment for high-\nrisk surgical patients, as well as for ODM plus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \nversus CVP monitoring plus conventional clinical \nassessment comparison for critically ill hospitalised \npatients. Results show that ODM strategies \nare likely to be considered cost-effective. More \nspecifically, the threshold value for the extra \ncost per additional survivor that would need to \nbe incurred before ODM would no longer be \nconsidered cost-effective was estimated. The \nrequired magnitude of these costs ranged from \n\u00a3581 to \u00a311,600. However, these results are heavily \ndependent on the underlying assumptions of the \nanalyses (e.g. pairwise comparisons rather than \ncomparisons of all relevant methods of monitoring, \nlimited number of studies, limited or non-existent \ndata on relevant outcomes, small sample sizes and \ndifferent underlying conditions).\nRecommendations \nfor research\nAlthough some modest data are available and \nconsideration can be given to the balance of costs \nand benefits using the data from the balance \nsheets, more formal economic evaluation would be \ndesirable to make better use of the data available \nand to make valuations implicit in any decision \nmore explicit. Furthermore, well-designed, \nmulticentre RCTs are required among high-\nrisk surgical patients to address the following \nquestion: Does ODM-guided fluid therapy plus \nconventional clinical assessment improve outcome \nwith and without CVP monitoring compared with \nconventional clinical assessment with and without \nCVP monitoring?\nAll the identified studies were conducted in \nunconscious patients. Newer ODM probes that \nmay be tolerated by awake patients are now \nmanufactured and further research is needed to \nevaluate these.Executive summary\nxii\nFurther research is required to assess the benefits \nof ODM-guided fluid administration during \nsurgery and continuing into the early postoperative \nperiod versus the benefits of ODM-guided fluid \nadministration during surgery alone. Further \nresearch is also required to determine the \noptimal number of hours for ODM-guided fluid \nadministration to continue after surgery once the \npatient has been admitted to a critical care facility.\nGiven the paucity of the existing economic \nevidence base any further primary research should \ninclude an economic evaluation or should provide \ndata suitable for use in an economic model.\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Traditionally, pulmonary artery \ncatheters (PACs) have been used to monitor \ncardiac output and haemodynamic status to guide \ntreatment. A recent Health Technology Assessment \n(HTA) Programme-funded study demonstrated \nthat PAC insertion and management of critically \nill patients using the variables monitored by PACs \nfails to confer an outcome benefit.1 Further studies \nhave also cast doubt on the value of PACs in high-\nrisk major surgery.2 This, coupled with concerns \nrelated to procedural complications associated \nwith the insertion and use of the PAC, along with \nthe development of less invasive cardiac output \nmonitors in clinical practice, has resulted in a \nglobal decline in the usage of the PAC in recent \nyears.\nLess invasive technologies to monitor cardiac \noutput and other haemodynamic variables \ninclude oesophageal Doppler monitoring (ODM), \ntransoesophageal echocardiography, transthoracic \nimpedance, carbon dioxide elimination and \nsystems based upon pulse contour analysis and dye \ndilution methods.\nOesophageal Doppler monitoring measures blood \nflow velocity in the descending thoracic aorta \nusing a flexible probe inserted into the patient\u2019s \noesophagus with an ultrasound transducer at its \ntip. The information is combined with an estimate \nof aortic cross-sectional area (derived from a \nnomogram based on the patient\u2019s age, height \nand weight) and an estimate of the fraction of the \ncardiac output perfusing the upper body, allowing \ncontinuous monitoring of cardiac output and \nhaemodynamic status. ODM is a relatively simple \nprocedure requiring no calibration and minimal \ntraining and has a good safety profile. The probe \nitself is uncomfortable and often poorly tolerated \nby awake patients, therefore patients monitored \nwith ODM generally need to be adequately sedated \nor anaesthetised. While this is often undertaken in \npatients requiring such monitoring, it does tend to \nlimit the use of the probes to an operating theatre, \nhigh dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit \n(ICU) environment. Newer, softer probes designed \nto be tolerated in awake patients have been \ndeveloped, but at present are not widely available.\nAlthough described as continuously monitoring, \nthe ODM probes often need to be refocused prior \nto each measurement, so they are normally used to \nmake frequent, repeated measurements rather than \nto provide a beat-by-beat measure of stroke volume.\nTransoesophageal echocardiography allows direct \nassessment of the heart\u2019s structure and function. \nIt can also be used to derive cardiac output by \nmeasuring the Doppler shift in the reflected \nultrasound beam to determine blood velocity and \nby direct measurement of the cross-sectional area of \nthe aorta. It has several limitations as a technique: \nthe probe is large and expensive; patients require \nconsiderable amounts of sedation or an anaesthetic \nto tolerate it; and a highly-skilled, highly-trained \noperator is required to operate the probe, as \nwithout one continuous monitoring of cardiac \nfunction is impossible.\nPulse contour analysis devices employ algorithms \nto calculate cardiac output from analysis of the \narterial pressure\/time waveform, and so require \nthe presence of an indwelling arterial catheter \n(often present anyway in the targeted populations). \nThere are several types of device available, but all \nrequire initial calibration with another measure of \ncardiac output which may be by means of either \na transpulmonary thermodilution or lithium \ndilution technique. Systems using thermodilution \nto calibrate also require the presence of a central \nvenous catheter, with its associated hazards. While \nlithium dilution calibration does not require \nthe presence of a central venous catheter, the \nlithium used to calibrate the system can interact \nwith muscle relaxant drugs used in anaesthesia. \nTherefore, care needs to be taken regarding \ntiming of calibration. Pulse contour devices, while \nrequiring calibration and taking slightly longer to \nset up than ODM, do have the advantage that they \ncan be tolerated by awake patients.\nChapter 1  \nBackgroundBackground\n2\nProponents of the use of cardiac output monitoring \nto guide fluid replacement and pharmacological \ntreatment suggest this allows optimisation of \nthe patient\u2019s haemodynamic status, helping to \nmaintain adequate tissue perfusion. This, in \nturn, prevents overt or occult organ damage \nwhich hinders the patient\u2019s recovery. Thus, \nmonitoring has the potential to reduce mortality, \ncomplications, lengths of stay in critical care \nfacilities and overall hospital stays, all of which \ncould result in savings in health-care costs.\nApproximately 3 million surgical operations are \nconducted in the UK annually, with an overall \nhospital mortality rate of 0.8\u20131.0%.3 The National \nConfidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and \nDeaths (NCEPOD) reports that there were over \n20,000 deaths following surgery in England, Wales \nand Northern Ireland alone in 2003.4 Therefore, \nany improvement in morbidity and mortality for \nthese patient groups would markedly improve \nimportant patient outcomes for large groups \nof patients as well as significantly improving \nutilisation of health-care resources.\nCurrent service provision\nIn the NHS, variation in practice exists with \nregard to haemodynamic optimisation and patient \nmonitoring during the perioperative period and \nin critical care environments. Inevitably, the lack \nof published national guidelines or frameworks in \nthis area contributes to these differences. The only \npublished statement from the National Institute \nfor Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) with \nregard to ODM to date has been as part of NICE\u2019s \nInterventional Procedures (IP) Programme, relating \nonly to safety and efficacy.5 ODM was not felt to fall \nwithin the IP Programme\u2019s remit as it is considered \nstandard clinical practice with risks and benefits \nthat are sufficiently well known.\nWithin the NHS the ODM that is most widely \nused is the CardioQ\uf6db device (Deltex Medical, \nChichester, UK). There are CardioQ monitors in \naround two-thirds of the 300 or so NHS hospitals \nthat regularly undertake moderate or major \nsurgery within the UK. The probes are single \nuse, and several types exist which can be used to \nmonitor for periods of from 6 hours to 10 days. \nCurrently the CardioQ is used to monitor around \n25,000 patients each year within the NHS. While \nit is difficult to state accurately the categories of \npatients in whom the ODM probes are being used, \ninformation from the manufacturer suggests that \napproximately one-third are used in intensive \ncare, one-third intraoperatively (theatre only) and \none-third throughout the perioperative period \n(although given the large number of potential \npatients their use overall remains infrequent).\nGiven the large number of operations carried out \nwithin the NHS each year (in excess of 2 million) \nand the relatively small number of cardiac output \nmonitors, many patients receive what might be \ntermed conventional clinical assessment. The \nrecent Agency for Health Care Research and \nQuality (ARHQ) report6 defined this as follows:\nConventional clinical assessment usually \nrefers to non-invasive assessment of various \nclinical markers. In some institutions, fluid \nmanagement may be based only on assessment \nof hemodynamic variables such as heart rate, \nsystolic blood pressure and urinary output, with \nno measure of blood flow or CVP.\nSuch a definition would seem to be applicable to \nthe NHS (although considerable variation in actual \npractice throughout the NHS might be expected).\nDescription of technology \nunder assessment\nOesophageal Doppler monitoring was first \ndescribed by Side and Gosling in the early 1970s \nand since then there have been significant advances \nin the technology and its clinical use. ODM is \ncurrently used in a variety of clinical settings, \nmost commonly in critical care environments \nand in patients undergoing surgery (particularly \npatients with significant co-morbidity or those \nundergoing major surgery with a high incidence \nof blood loss and\/or significant fluid shifts.) \nODM allows continuous monitoring of a patient\u2019s \nhaemodynamic variables and, more importantly, \nallows the display of trends in these variables. This \nallows the clinician to titrate intravenous fluids \nand inotropic drugs to optimise tissue perfusion \nand oxygen delivery. The length of time this \nmonitoring is required depends on the individual \nclinical situation. Upon completion of ODM the \nprobe is simply removed.\nThe procedure measures blood velocity in the \ndescending thoracic aorta using a flexible probe \ninserted into the patient\u2019s oesophagus via the \nmouth or nose. The tip of the probe contains a \ntransducer which transmits an ultrasound beam. \nThe tip is advanced to mid-thoracic level and \u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

This information is combined \nwith an estimate of aortic cross-sectional area \n(derived from a nomogram based on the patient\u2019s \nage, height and weight) and upper body blood \nflow, allowing haemodynamic variables such as \ncardiac output, stroke volume and systolic flow time \nto be continuously measured. In addition, if other \nvariables such as central venous pressure (CVP) and \nblood pressure are known, derived variables such as \nsystemic vascular resistance can be calculated.\nThe probe and monitor are simple to use, and a \nperiod of training in groups of no more than 12 \npatients has been shown to be sufficient to ensure \nreliable measurements of cardiac output.7 Generally \nspeaking, the probe can be inserted and a clear \nsignal can be obtained within a few minutes.\nOesophageal Doppler monitoring has been shown \nto have a high validity (no bias and high clinical \nagreement) for monitoring changes in cardiac \noutput during the management of critically ill \npatients in both operating rooms and ICUs.8 Good \ncorrelation also exists when comparing cardiac \noutput measurements derived from ODM and \nPACs by means of thermodilution.7,9\u201311\nContraindications to insertion of ODM probes \ninclude patients under 16 years of age (special \nalternative probes and equipment are necessary \nfor these patients), severe bleeding diathesis, facial \ntrauma, oesophageal abnormalities such as varices, \nstents, strictures, carcinoma or oesophagitis and \nrecent oesophageal or upper airway surgery. The \npresence of arrhythmias, severe aortic valve disease \nor a thoracic aortic aneurysm or the use of an intra-\naortic balloon counterpulsation device, while not \nabsolute contraindications to inserting the probe, \nmay lead to difficulty in obtaining an accurate \nwaveform and meaningful information.\nCare needs to be taken in interpreting the data \nin certain other clinical situations as ODM makes \nthe assumption that a constant proportion of the \ncardiac output enters the descending aorta, which \nis not always the case. Redistribution of blood flow \nbetween the ascending and descending aorta may \noccur during cross clamping of the aorta and with \nacute haemorrhage, where more of the cardiac \noutput may be selectively diverted to coronary and \ncerebral circulation as opposed to the descending \naorta. In addition, the presence of a sympathetic \nblock to the lower body (such as that caused by \nepidural or spinal anaesthesia\/analgesia) may lead \nto an overestimation of cardiac output.\nAlthough there are no reported major \ncomplications resulting directly from the use \nof the ODM probe, a small number of minor \ncomplications have been reported in the literature, \nsuch as minor oral trauma and inadvertent tracheal \nplacement of the probe.6\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Currently, there are no \nuniversally accepted guidelines on how to select \npatients requiring cardiac output monitoring either \nperioperatively or in a critical care environment. \nPractice varies within the NHS because of a \nnumber of variables, notably individual clinician \npreferences, patient characteristics and local \npractices, guidelines or protocols.\nAim and objectives \nof this review\nGiven this uncertainty about the role of cardiac \noutput monitoring, the aim of this review was to \nassess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of one \nparticular type of monitoring, ODM, when used \nfor monitoring cardiac function in comparison with \n(a) standard care (i.e. no cardiac output monitor \nperioperatively) among critically ill patients and \npatients undergoing major surgery, and (b) other \nmethods of monitoring heart function (such as PAC \nor pulse contour monitoring devices) in critically ill \npatients or in patients undergoing major surgery.\nAs described in subsequent chapters, the analysis \nfocused on outcomes of most importance to \npatients (e.g. mortality, length of hospitalisation, \nlength of stay in critical care and complication \nrates). Cost-effectiveness was assessed from the \nperspective of the NHS and personal social \nservices.\nIn the following two sections, the place of cardiac \noutput monitoring in the pathways of care of both \npatients undergoing major surgery and critically ill \npatients is briefly described.\nUse of cardiac output \nmonitoring among patients \nundergoing major surgery\nCardiac output monitoring systems are used in \noperating theatres across all the major surgical \nspecialties. They tend to be used predominantly \nfor surgery of moderate to major severity, often \nin patients with significant co-morbidity or \nwhere significant blood loss or fluid shifts may \nbe anticipated, as a consequence of either the \npatient\u2019s underlying condition or their anticipated \nsurgery. However, not every patient undergoing \nmajor surgery will need to have their cardiac \noutput monitored; generally they will be assessed \npreoperatively and the need for cardiac output \nmonitoring will be determined by the anaesthetist \nbased upon the clinical assessment, taking into \naccount surgical factors and patient factors \nincluding co-morbidities (Figures 1 and 2). The \nanaesthetist may also be guided by the results \nof preoperative cardiac testing such as stress \nechocardiography or radionuclide cardiography \n(such tests are likely to be performed regardless of \nwhether the use of ODM is an option).12 Although \nthe decision to use cardiac output monitoring \nis usually made preoperatively, occasionally \nfactors encountered during surgery may lead \nto a decision to adopt monitoring during the \nintraoperative period, and this may continue into \nthe postoperative period. Monitoring of surgical \npatients typically finishes at the end of the surgery.\nUse of cardiac output \nmonitoring among \ncritically ill patients\nPatients requiring treatment in an ICU (level 3 \ncare) or an HDU (level 2 care), by definition, need \na higher level of care and monitoring than that \navailable in general wards (level 1 care) (based on \nthe Department of Health classification system). \nThe decision to utilise these higher levels of care \nmay be affected by a number of factors including \npatients\u2019 underlying surgical condition, their co-\nmorbidities and the nature of surgery performed. \nIn these complicated patients, haemodynamic \nfunction is frequently disturbed owing to a \ncombination of the patient\u2019s existing disease(s) \ninteracting with acute haemodynamic instability \ncaused by surgery, anaesthesia, acute blood loss \nand fluid shifts. These complex interactions \nare not always apparent or easily interpretable \nusing conventional clinical assessment and \nChapter 2  \nThe decision problemThe decision problem\n6\nPatient\ncharacteristics\nHaemodynamic status\n(e.g. blood loss and\nbody fluid instability)\nUnderlying\ndisease\/condition\nSurgery-\nrelated factors\nPatient\nassessment\nFIGURE 1  Pre-surgery assessment of patient.\nPatient\nassessment\nNo monitoring\ndevice needed\nPAC\nODM\nPulse contour:\nLiDCO\nPulse contour:\nPICCO\nMonitoring\ndevice needed\nWill follow with\nconventional\nclinical assessment\nConventional clinical\nassessment only\nConventional clinical\nassessment +\nmonitoring device\nFIGURE 2  Decision regarding use of cardiac output monitoring system.\nmonitoring alone.

In the event \nof any uncertainty a second reviewer was consulted. \nAny disagreements were resolved by arbitration by \na third party.\nData were extracted by one reviewer. Information \nwas recorded on: year of publication; source of \nfunding; study design; methods pre-randomisation \n(e.g. stratification); method of randomisation; \nconcealment of allocation; blinding procedures; \nnumber and characteristics of participants; \nduration of interventions; choice of outcome \nmeasures; and length of follow-up. Reviewers were \nnot blinded to authors, institutions or publications. \nWhere there was deemed to be insufficient \ninformation in the published report, the authors \nwere not contacted owing to the time constraints \ninvolved.\nQuality assessment strategy\nThe methodological quality of RCTs included \nin the review was to be assessed using the \nDelphi criteria list, adapted from Verhagen and \ncolleagues.13 However, in order to be consistent \nwith the approach taken by the AHRQ report, \nthe methodological quality of the two additional \nstudies that were identified was appraised using the \nECRI 25-question quality scale (see Appendix 4). \nECRI used these 25 items to compute a summary \nscore ranging from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating an \nideal study and 0 indicating a study of the poorest \nquality. Individual item answers were converted \nto numerical scores by allocating 1 for each \u2018Yes\u2019 \nanswer, \u22121 for each \u2018No\u2019 answer and \u22120.5 for each \nitem that was not reported. The numerical scores \nfor all 25 items were then added, 25 was added \nto the total, and this number was then divided by \n50 and then multiplied by 10.

Studies that \nscored < 5 were considered unacceptable quality, \n> 5 but \u2264\u20096.7 were considered low quality, > 6.7 but \n\u2264\u20098.4 were considered moderate quality, and \u2265 8.5 \nwere considered high quality.6\nThe methodological quality of the AHRQ report \n(key questions 2 and 3) was assessed using a \npreviously validated 10-item checklist developed \nby Oxman and Guyatt (see Appendix 5).14,15 This \nchecklist contained nine criteria, checked as \u2018Yes\u2019, \n\u2018Partially\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 depending on the extent to which \nthey had been met. There was also one summary \ncriterion for overall scientific quality, scored on a \nscale of 1\u20137, with 1 indicating \u2018extensive flaws\u2019 and \n7 indicating \u2018minimal flaws\u2019.\nData analysis\nFor trials with multiple publications, only the most \nup-to-date or complete data for each outcome \nwere included. Where appropriate, meta-analysis \nwas employed to estimate a summary measure of \neffect on relevant outcomes based on intention-to-\ntreat analyses. It was originally planned to combine \ndichotomous outcome data using the Mantel\u2013\nHaenszel relative risk (RR) method. However, to be \nconsistent with the approach taken by the AHRQ \nreport, dichotomous data were combined instead \nusing odds ratios (ORs). When trials had roughly \nequal numbers of participants in each group and \nevents were rare the Peto OR method was used. \nContinuous outcomes were combined using the \ninverse variance weighted mean difference (WMD) \nmethod. For the estimates of RR and WMD, 95% \nCIs and p-values were calculated. The results \nwere reported using a fixed-effects model. Chi-\nsquared tests and I2 statistics were used to explore \nstatistical heterogeneity across studies. Possible \nreasons for heterogeneity were explored using \nsensitivity analysis. Where there was no clear reason \nfor heterogeneity, the implications were explored \nusing random effects methods. All meta-analyses \nwere undertaken using Review Manager (RevMan) \nsoftware. Where a quantitative synthesis was \nconsidered to be inappropriate or not feasible, a \nnarrative synthesis of results was provided. Where a \nlack of uniformity of the data was present in many \nstudies, a qualitative review looking for consistency \nbetween studies was performed. This was \nsupplemented, where appropriate, by investigation \nof the consistency in the direction of the results \nusing the Sign test.16\nResults\nNumber of studies identified\nThe results of the searches are summarised in \nTable 1 and Figure 3. The numbers retrieved from \nthe searches in CINAHL, Science Citation Index \n(SCI), BIOSIS and CENTRAL include only the \nadditional reports found after excluding those \nidentified from the MEDLINE\/EMBASE multifile \nsearch.

The type of surgery performed \nincluded elective bowel surgery,17,21,24 elective \ncardiac surgery20 and elective general, urological or \ngynaecological surgery.18\nMortality\nAll five studies reported that no deaths occurred \nduring surgery in either the ODM or the control \ngroup. Three studies17,20,21 reported one death each \nin the control group (1\/28; 1\/30; 1\/52, respectively) \nwithin 30 days following surgery, and one study24 \nreported one death in the control group (1\/64) \nwithin 60 days following surgery. However, the \nAHRQ report stated that the between-group \ndifferences were not statistically significant.\nFigure 4 shows a meta-analysis (Peto method) \nundertaken by the Aberdeen group of the five \nstudies reporting mortality. This shows that ODM \nwas associated with statistically significantly fewer \ndeaths compared with control (OR 0.13, 95% CI \n0.02\u20130.96). In this analysis the study by Mythen \nand colleagues,20 which investigated elective cardiac \nsurgery patients, has also been included and, even \nthough the study is small, it exhibits a similar \ntrend to that observed in the other studies. The \nmeta-analysis results should be interpreted with \ncaution because of the low number of events and \nthe overall low number of patients in the combined \ntotals.\nMajor complications\nThree of five studies reported major \ncomplications,17,20,21 which were generally defined \nas life threatening or requiring intensive or high-\ndependency care. The type of complications \nreported included severe tachyarrhythmias17 and \nchest infection, multiple organ failure, respiratory \nfailure, cerebrovascular accident and paralytic \nileus.20 All three studies showed a statistically \nsignificant difference in major complications \nthat favoured the ODM groups (all of the major \nReview:  Oesophageal Doppler monitoring\nComparison:  ODM + CVP + conventional assessment vs CVP + conventional assessment\nOutcome:  Mortality\nStudy or \nsubcategory\nODM\nn\/N\nControl\nn\/N\nPeto OR\n95% CI\nWeight\n%\nPeto OR\n95% CI Order\nGan, 2002\n18 0\/50 0\/50 Not estimable0\nConway, 2002\n17 0\/29 1\/28 24.99 0.13 (0.00\u20136.59)0\nMythen, 1995\n20 0\/30 1\/30 25.00 0.14 (0.00\u20136.82)0\nNoblett, 2006\n21 0\/51 1\/52 25.00 0.14 (0.00\u20136.95)0\nWakeling, 2005\n24 0\/64 1\/64 25.00 0.14 (0.00\u20136.82)0\nTotal (95% CI) 224 224 100.00 0.13 (0.02\u20130.96)\nTotal events: 0 (ODM),4(Control)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 0.00, df = 3( p = 1.00), I\n2 = 0%\nTest for overall effect: z = 2.00 (p = 0.05)\n 0.01  0.1  1  10  100\nFavours ODMF avours control\nFIGURE 4  Meta-analysis of studies reporting mortality (Aberdeen TAR group).\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The \nAHRQ report stated that the ORs [Peto method; \n(95% CI)] for the three studies were \u22122.08 (\u22123.72 \nto \u22120.44),21 \u22122.19 (\u22124.01 to \u22120.37)17 and \u22122.19 \n(\u22123.86 to \u22120.51).20 Although a meta-analysis was \nundertaken, the AHRQ report did not present a \npooled estimate of effect size on the grounds that \nonly three of the five studies (i.e. less than 80%) \nreported separate data on major complications. \nThe 95% CI around the pooled estimate was \n0.04\u20130.31, indicating that ODM was associated with \nstatistically significantly fewer major complications.\nFigure 5 shows a meta-analysis (Peto method) \nundertaken by the Aberdeen group of the three \nstudies reporting major complications, with \nthe pooled estimate showing that ODM was \nassociated with statistically significantly fewer major \ncomplications (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04\u20130.31). It is \nagain worth noting that the data relating to use of \nODM in cardiac surgery patients20 are similar to \nthose from the other studies reporting outcomes \nconducted on non-cardiac patients.\nTotal complications\nFour studies reported total complications.17,18,21,24 \nThe AHRQ report stated that two studies showed \na statistically significant difference, indicating \nfewer total complications in the ODM group \n(OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10\u20130.54;18 OR 0.41, 95% CI \n0.20\u20130.8424). The other two studies also showed \nfewer complications in the ODM group, without \nreaching statistical significance (OR 0.44, 95% CI \n0.13\u20131.54;17 OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.20\u20131.0721). Gan \nand colleagues18 reported the total number of \ncomplications rather than the number of patients \nwith complications. Although a random-effects \nmeta-analysis was undertaken, the AHRQ report \ndid not present a pooled estimate of effect on the \ngrounds that the studies reported complications \nsomewhat differently (patients versus events). The \n95% CI around the pooled estimate was \u22121.43 to \n\u22120.57, indicating that ODM was associated with \nstatistically significantly fewer total complications.\nFigure 6 shows a meta-analysis undertaken by \nthe Aberdeen group of the three studies that \nreported the number of patients in each group who \nexperienced complications. The pooled estimate \nshows that ODM was associated with statistically \nsignificantly fewer total complications (OR 0.43, \n95% CI 0.26\u20130.71).\nLength of hospital stay\nAll five studies reported this outcome. The \nAHRQ report stated that four studies reported a \nstatistically significant reduction in length of stay \n(based on either medians or means) associated with \nODM, with a median of 6 versus 7 days, p = 0.03;18 \n7 (IQR 3\u201335) versus 9 (IQR 4\u201345) days, p = 0.005;21 \n10 (IQR 5.75) versus 11.5 (IQR 4.75) days, \np = 0.03;24 and a mean of 6.4 (range 5\u20139) versus \n10.1 (range 5\u201348) days, p = 0.01.20 The fifth study, \nby Conway and colleagues,17 reported a median of \n12 (range 7\u2013103) days for the ODM group versus \n11 (range 7\u201330) days for the control group (p-value \nnot reported).

An overall pooled estimate was not \npresented on the grounds that three of the five \nstudies reporting this outcome did not present data \nthat allowed a precise effect size to be calculated. \nHowever the 95% CI was presented; this was \u22122.21 \nto \u22120.57 days, indicating that ODM was associated \nwith a statistically significantly shorter length of \nhospital stay.\nAlthough the data should be treated extremely \ncautiously, Figure 7 shows a meta-analysis \nundertaken by the Aberdeen group of the two \nstudies reporting means and standard deviations \nfor length of hospital stay. The pooled estimate \nshows that ODM was associated with a statistically \nsignificantly shorter length of hospital stay \n(WMD \u22121.82, 95% CI \u22122.98 to \u22120.65). There is \nevidence of heterogeneity which may be caused \nby differences between the two study population \ngroups, although much of the difference in the \nmean length of stay in the Conway study was \ncaused by one patient in the ODM group (see \nfootnote, Table 5). As this meta-analysis includes \nonly one of the four studies favouring ODM it \nmight be argued that the estimate is slightly biased \nagainst ODM.\nOverall, the data available for length of stay \nsuggest that this may be shorter in the ODM group, \nalthough the precise magnitude of the difference \nis uncertain. However, the data from the Aberdeen \nmeta-analysis also suggest that the type of patient \nmay also be important.\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

This was a poster by Dodd \nand colleagues26 involving 40 patients undergoing \ncolorectal surgery.\nMortality\nThe AHRQ report stated that both studies \nreported that no deaths occurred during surgery. \nVenn and colleagues23 reported that three (3\/30) \ndeaths occurred in the ODM group and two (2\/29) \noccurred in the control group within 30 days \nfollowing surgery, while Sinclair and colleagues22 \nreported that one (1\/20) death occurred in the \ncontrol group during this period. Sinclair and \ncolleagues22 reported a further two deaths [one \n(1\/20) in the ODM group and one in the control \ngroup] after this period and within 3 months \nfollowing surgery. In terms of total mortality rates, \nthe AHRQ report stated that neither study showed \na statistically significant difference between the two \ntreatment groups.\nThe additional study by Dodd and colleagues26 \nreported hospital mortality of one (1\/20) death \nin the ODM group and two (2\/20) deaths in the \ncontrol group.Effectiveness\n18\nFigure 8 shows a meta-analysis of studies reporting \nmortality undertaken by the Aberdeen group, \nincluding the additional study by Dodd and \ncolleagues,26 with the pooled estimate failing to \nreach statistical significance and with confidence \nintervals sufficiently wide to include clinically \nimportant differences favouring either intervention \n(OR 0.81, 95% 0.23\u20132.77).\nMajor complications\nSinclair and colleagues22 did not report \ncomplications and Venn and colleagues23 did not \nreport major complications separately from total \ncomplications.

The four outcomes reported by the \nAHRQ report were mortality, major complications, \ntotal complications and length of hospital stay. \nNone of the studies reported quality of life data. \nNone of the studies reported results for patients \nwith sepsis compared with those without sepsis.\nThe AHRQ report used an ECRI 25-question scale \nto assess the quality of the included studies. This \nscale was also applied to the additional studies \nthat were identified. In the AHRQ report, for all \ncomparisons reported by more than one study, \nthe median quality score fell within the range \n\u2265 8.5 to 10.0, a quality rating of \u2018high\u2019 for this \nevidence base. The additional study by Dodd and \ncolleagues26 also received a quality rating of \u2018high\u2019, \nwhile the study by Chytra and colleagues25 fell \nwithin the range > 6.7 but \u2264\u20098.4 and received a \nquality rating of \u2018moderate\u2019.\nThe AHRQ report scored 5 (minor bias) on a scale \nof 1 (extensive flaws) to 7 (minimal flaws) on the \nOxman and Guyatt checklist14,15 for assessing the \nmethodological quality of systematic reviews.\nFive studies involving 453 patients reported ODM \nplus CVP monitoring plus conventional assessment \nversus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nassessment during surgery.17,18,20,21,24 The AHRQ \nreport did not pool mortality data. In meta-\nanalyses undertaken by the Aberdeen group, \npooled estimates showed statistically significantly \nfewer deaths in the ODM group (Peto OR 0.13, \n95% CI 0.02\u20130.96) and a statistically significant \nreduction in the incidence of major complications \n(Peto OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04\u20130.31) and total \ncomplications (fixed-effects OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26\u2013\n0.71). However, as noted above, as the number \nof deaths was low and the total combined sample \nsize was modest, the pooled estimate for mortality \nshould be interpreted with caution.

Nevertheless, \nthe results from this study were consistent with the \nresults of the others.\nOnly Venn and colleagues23 reported ODM plus \nconventional assessment versus CVP monitoring \nplus conventional assessment during surgery, \nin a study involving 61 patients. Although the \noutcomes reported favoured the ODM group, \nnone were statistically significant and confidence \nintervals were sufficiently wide to include clinically \nimportant differences favouring either treatment.\nTwo studies22,23 included in the AHRQ report \nand one additional study26 involving a total of \n139 patients reported ODM plus conventional \nassessment versus conventional assessment during \nsurgery. None of the studies showed a statistically \nsignificant difference in mortality, and in a meta-\nanalysis of the three studies undertaken by the \nAberdeen group, the pooled estimate was not \nstatistically significant (fixed-effects OR 0.81, 95% \nCI 0.23\u20132.77). None of the studies reported the \noutcome of major complications. Only Venn and \ncolleagues23 reported total complications, with the \nAHRQ report stating that there was a statistically \nsignificant difference in favour of the ODM group \nin terms of the number of complications (OR 0.23, \n95% CI 0.07\u20130.72) but not in terms of the number \nof patients experiencing complications (0.41, 95% \nCI 0.14\u20131.16).\nOne study19 included in the AHRQ report and \none additional study25 involving a total of 336 \npatients reported ODM plus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional assessment versus CVP monitoring \nplus conventional assessment among critically \nill patients. Neither study showed a statistically \nsignificant difference in mortality, and in a meta-\nanalysis undertaken by the Aberdeen group, the \npooled estimate was not statistically significant \n(fixed-effects OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41\u20131.70).

No language restrictions or \nlimitations to searches were imposed.\nDatabases searched were MEDLINE (1990\u2013June \nweek 3 2007), EMBASE (1990\u2013week 26 2007), \nMEDLINE In-Process (29 June 2007), SCI (1990\u20131 \nJuly 2007), NHS Economic Evaluation Database \n(NHS EED) (May 2007), HTA Database (May 2007) \nand Health Management Information Consortium \n(HMIC) (1990\u2013May 2007).

Websites of both professional organisations \n(including Anaesthesia UK, Critical Care, \nIntensive Care Society, International Collaboration \nfor Excellence in Critical Care Medicine) \nand manufacturers (Deltex Medical, Arrow \nInternational) were also searched. Full details of the \nsearch strategies used are documented in Appendix \n3.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria \nIn order to be included, studies had to compare, \nin terms of both costs and outcomes, strategies \ninvolving ODM compared with no cardiac \nmonitoring, PAC or pulse contour analysis \nmonitoring for the monitoring of critically ill and \nhigh-risk surgical patients.

The number of reports retrieved from \nthe search in SCI and HMIC is the total after \ndeduplication against the results of the MEDLINE\/\nEMBASE multifile search.\nEleven papers were selected from the searches, \nnone of which met the inclusion criteria for the \nsystematic review, and were selected for background \ninformation purposes only. Details of these studies \ncan be obtained from the authors.\nBalance sheet\nAs described above, no economic evaluations \nthat met the inclusion criteria were found from \nthe systematic search of the literature. It was, \ntherefore, not possible to provide any comment \non the comparative costs and\/or effects of ODM \nin comparison with relevant comparators. To give \nan idea of the impact that regular use of ODM \nmight have on the NHS in terms of costs and \neffects, a series of balance sheets were drawn up. \nThe balance sheet presents the differences between \ninterventions, in terms of resource use and natural \nand clinical measures of effectiveness. Such an \napproach serves to highlight the choices and trade-\noffs between the various monitoring modalities. \nNonetheless, any decision based on the balance \nsheet approach is made using an implicit (rather \nthan an explicit) synthesis of the available data.\nComparisons made\nData gathered from the review of effectiveness \nreported in Chapter 3 compared various strategies \ninvolving ODM use for patients following major \nsurgery and for hospitalised patients. In total, \nthree different strategies involving ODM versus \nno ODM were extracted from the literature for \nhigh-risk surgical patients. Only one strategy \ninvolving ODM versus no ODM was extracted \nfrom the current literature in relation to critically \nill hospitalised patients. No evidence was available \nfor the comparison of strategies that include \nODM compared with PAC and\/or thermodilution \ntechniques. Therefore, all comparisons relate to the \nuse of conventional clinical assessment and\/or the \nuse of CVP monitoring. Separate balance sheets \nare presented for each strategy and patient group \nand, where possible, a pooled effect size from the \nmeta-analysis conducted as part of the review of \neffectiveness is reported (Tables 9, 10, 11 and 12).\nResults of balance sheets\nHigh-risk surgical patients\nComparison of ODM plus \nCVP plus conventional clinical \nassessment with CVP plus \nconventional clinical assessment\nThis comparison (Table 9) had the greatest \nnumber of studies contributing data to it and, as \nthe pooled estimates demonstrate, the addition \nof ODM consistently outperforms the no ODM \nstrategy. However, these results should be treated \nwith caution as the number of studies contributing \nfor each estimate as well as the sample sizes were \nsmall, and some of them were conducted in patient \ngroups with different underlying conditions.

Further, based \non clinical advice, it is known that this technology \nwould be used predominantly in an HDU\/ICU or \nthe operating theatre setting (Drs Gordon Houston \nand Brian Cuthbertson, July 2007, personal \ncommunication). Data provided by manufacturer \nDeltex Medical indicate that the one-off cost of the \nCardioQ Doppler monitor is approximately \u00a38000. \nThe disposable probe ranges in price from \u00a360 \nfor a clinically clean probe lasting up to 6 hours \nto \u00a3121 for a sterile probe that lasts up to 10 days. \nDeltex Medical also states that the delivered cost \nof a probe is the only direct cost of using the probe \nother than a negligible amount per patient relating \nto the cost of ultrasound gel. It is possible that \nmore than one probe may be required per patient. \nThis decision will be influenced by the choice of \nthe initial probe, which in turn depends upon a \nprior clinical judgement as to how a patient will \nrespond. Several pricing schemes exist in relation \nto the acquirement of the monitor; e.g. a rental \nagreement for the monitor is a common method \nwhereby a monitor is placed in the hospital free of \ncharge with a varying incremental cost for every \nprobe purchased (\u00a30\u2013\u00a315), depending on the \nvolume of probes purchased. With reference to the \nvarious pricing schemes, it should be stressed that \nsignificant variation between centres is common \nowing to the standard practice of direct individual \nnegotiation with manufacturers in NHS centres. \nInformation from Deltex Medical also suggests that \nthe reusable monitoring device is likely to last many \nyears, although some costs in terms of maintenance \nand servicing would be incurred. A standard 1-year \nservice contract might cost approximately \u00a3550. It \nmight be reasonable to assume, however, that the \nadditional cost per patient in terms of reusable \nequipment alone would be negligible, and that the \nmain additional cost of ODM would be the cost of \nthe disposable probes.\nAlthough it should be treated cautiously as it \nis based on the synthesis of two small studies \nconsidering different patient groups, the pooled \nestimate of a 1.82 day reduction in hospital stay \nfor ODM patients (Table 9) would result in a cost \nsaving per patient in terms of length of stay only \non an ICU ward of \u00a33123 per patient, given the \nunit cost of \u00a31716 for a day on a Level 3 ICU \nward (the most frequently cited level of care).28 \nSimilarly, if the hospital days saved related to a stay \non an HDU ward, the cost saving would be \u00a31431, \nassuming a unit cost of \u00a3786 for a day on a Level 2 \nHDU ward (again the most frequently cited level).28 \nFinally, if the reduction in length of stay is related \nto a stay on a general surgical ward, the cost saving \nfor a 1.82 day reduction in length of stay would be \n\u00a3564.29 While the precise cost of the staff time and \nequipment required for ODM monitoring has not \nbeen estimated it could be inferred that the cost \nper patient of the addition of ODM is likely, at the \nvery least, to be less than the cost savings associated \nwith the reduction in length of stay for ICU and \nHDU patients. The use of monitoring may also Systematic review of economic evaluations\n26\nlead to some forms of treatment being initiated \n(e.g. the use of intravenous fluids, etc.). Arguably, \nthe ODM group may receive more interventions \nand\/or more appropriate interventions. However, \nthe net effect on cost is uncertain.\nComparison of ODM plus \nCVP plus conventional clinical \nassessment with CVP plus \nconventional clinical assessment\nFor this comparison, again, it is known that there \nwould be additional costs associated with the use of \nODM, i.e. equipment and staffing, although there \nis no evidence of a difference in the main selected \nmeasures of outcome (Table 10). As fewer studies \ncontributed data to this comparison it is not as \nclear what cost savings in terms of length of stay, \nfor example, might be found.\nComparison of ODM plus \nconventional clinical assessment with \nconventional clinical assessment \nfor high-risk surgical patients\nTable 11 shows the balance sheet for this \ncomparison. As any difference in length of stay \nmight be considerable (OR \u22126.76, 95% CI \n\u221211.83 to \u22121.68), if such a difference exists it is \nhighly likely that savings in length of stay would \nmore than compensate for the cost of using \nODM. However, it is less clear from the evidence \navailable whether total costs will indeed be less \nas there are insufficient data available to identify \ndifferences in mortality, complications or the costs \nof treatments incurred because of monitoring, \nand the confidence intervals surrounding such \nestimates are sufficiently wide to include clinically \nand economically important differences. Similarly, \nthere is insufficient evidence to judge whether the \nuse of ODM increases total benefits. Therefore, \nshould ODM be adopted, a judgement would have \nto be made that the trends in favour observed for \nother comparisons would be maintained for this \ncomparison.\nCritically ill hospitalised patients\nFor this group of patients data were available for \none comparison: ODM plus CVP monitoring \nplus conventional clinical assessment versus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment. \nThe balance sheet for this comparison is shown \nin Table 12. It appears there are likely to be \nreductions in total complications and length of \nhospital stay though the evidence relating to this \nparticular subgroup of patients is sparse. What we \ncannot directly tell from the balance sheet is the \nlikely impact on cost. As noted above the effect \non cost of additional interventions prompted \nby the monitoring is unclear. It is also unclear \nwhat savings may accrue through reductions \nin length of stay (reported as 1\u20132 days for this \ncomparison). Given the unit cost for a day on an \nICU ward of \u00a31716, an HDU ward cost of \u00a3786 \nand general medical ward cost of \u00a3310 then the \ncost of using ODM may reasonably be expected \nto be compensated for by this reduction in \nlength of stay.28,29 However given the uncertainty \nsurrounding the effect on mortality and major \ncomplications then a decision to adopt ODM would \nimply that a judgement has been made that the \nreduction in mortality and complications observed \nfor other uses of ODM would be continued in this \nsetting.\nTABLE 10  Balance sheet comparing ODM plus conventional clinical assessment with CVP plus conventional clinical assessment for \nhigh-risk surgical patients\nODM + conventional clinical assessment CVP + conventional clinical assessment\nAdditional costs of CVP: staff time, reusable and disposable \nequipment required for insertion, monitoring and removing \nof catheter\nAdditional costs of ODM: staff time, reusable and disposable \nequipment required for insertion, monitoring and removal of \nthe probe\nNo evidence of a difference in\nMortality\nMajor complications\nTotal complications\nLength of hospital stay\nCost of additional interventions, e.g. use of intravenous fluids or drugs prompted by the monitoring\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

However, no separate results were \npresented for these patients. The HTA suggests \nthat PAC was unlikely to be cost-effective for \nthis group of patients. The HTA also provided \nan indication of the cost drivers, i.e. the major \ndeterminants of the differences in cost between the \ninterventions compared. It is likely that the costs of \nODM compared with the costs of no ODM will be \ndriven by similar factors, primarily length of stay \ndifferences. The trial reported in the HTA found \nthat for the financial year 2002\u20133, the cost per day \nin an ICU was \u00a31353. Thus, if the addition of ODM \nto high-risk surgical and critically ill hospitalised \npatients does lead to a significant reduction in \nlength of ICU stay, it is likely to have a large impact Systematic review of economic evaluations\n28\non cost. Other things being equal, if the costs of \nequipment and staffing associated with ODM per \npatient were to be less than \u00a3310 [a conservative \nestimate based on data from Information Servicers \nDivision (ISD) Scotland]29 regular ODM use is likely \nto be cost saving, especially if we take into account \nthe cost information supplied by the manufacturer \n(Ewan Phillips, Deltex Medical, July 2007, personal \ncommunication).\nSummary\nThis chapter presents the overall evidence \ncurrently available on the cost-effectiveness of \nODM compared with relevant comparators in \nthe management of critically ill hospitalised \npatients and high-risk surgical patients, based \non a systematic review of the literature. No \neconomic evaluations that met inclusion criteria \nwere identified and little extra knowledge of the \ncost-effectiveness of ODM relative to the various \nstrategies could be ascertained.\nIn order to explore the choices and trade-offs of \nthe various monitoring modalities, a balance sheet \nwas presented for each strategy for which evidence \nwas available from the review of effectiveness. Some \nevidence indicates that ODM might be expected \nto be more efficient than not using ODM but any \njudgement depends upon the strategies compared. \nFurther information for the critically ill hospitalised \npatient group compared with high-risk surgical \npatients is required owing to the sparse data on this \npatient group. The trade-offs highlighted by the \nbalance sheets could be further informed by more \nformal consideration of the balance of probabilities \nin terms of which strategy is or is not likely to be \ncost-effective.\nIn terms of effectiveness, it should be noted that \nno comparisons of ODM with thermodilution or \nPAC methods were found and that, therefore, such \ncomparisons are not included in this review or on \nthe balance sheet.\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

However, unless all \nrelevant factors favour one strategy then decisions \nbased on these usually rely on implicit valuations \nof the trade-offs that may exist. These valuations \nmay differ from person to person and might lead \nto different policy decisions being made that are \ndifficult to debate objectively. One of the main \nassets that economic models have is their ability to \nmake explicit many of these implicit weights. This \nchapter explores the scope for an economic model \nto assess the relative cost-effectiveness of using \nODM.\nAn economic model for ODM\nDrummond and colleagues defined economic \nevaluation as the \u2018comparative analysis of \nalternative courses of action in terms of both their \ncosts and consequences,\u2019 ideally over the remaining \nlifetime of the patient.30 Economic evaluations are \nan important aid to decision-making because (a) a \nsystematic analysis makes it easier to identify clearly \nthe relevant alternatives; (b) such an approach \nmakes explicit the viewpoint of the analysis; and \n(c) without some attempt at measurement, the \nuncertainty surrounding orders of magnitude can \nbe critical.\nMoreover, there are certain characteristics that \nan economic model should have in order to be a \nsound basis for decision-making. Among these is \nthat it should include all the relevant alternatives \nfor comparison and should allow for appropriate \ninformation to be taken into account within the \nevaluation. The model can be thought of as \ndescribing the pathways of care that a patient \nmay follow in situations where ODM is and is not \nused. A potential model structure should consider \nstrategies that include no cardiac monitoring, \nalone or in combination with technologies such \nas pulse contour analysis monitoring, lithium \ndilution cardiac monitors (i.e. LiDCO monitor), \nand thermodilution cardiac monitors (i.e. PiCCO \nmonitor), as comparators for strategies that include \nODM. A similar model structure could be outlined \nfor the use of ODM within hospital critical care.\nBy clearly structuring the decision problem it is \npossible to highlight the data that are needed to \nfully inform any decision. However, it is possible \nthat decisions might be reasonably made without \nall these data. In subsequent sections we explore \nhow the data that are currently available can be \nused more fully to inform judgements on cost-\neffectiveness.\nCost of ODM\nIn this section data provided by a manufacturer, \nDeltex Medical, as well as data from public sources \nhave been used to estimate the extra (incremental) \ncosts associated with ODM. Table 13 shows the \nannual total cost of ODM assuming a 5-year \nlifetime for the monitor. The costs of ODM are \nbased on data provided by Deltex Medical (Ewan \nPhillips, Deltex Medical, August 2007, personal \ncommunication).\nThe cost of the probes varies from \u00a360 for a 6-hour \noral\/nasal Doppler probe for use intraoperatively \nor perioperatively to \u00a3121 for a 10-day sterilised \noral Doppler probe for use in critical care. \nInformation from the manufacturer indicated that \nthe use of more than one probe by a patient was \nrare. Therefore, it was assumed that the number \nof probes used per monitor per year is similar to \nthe number of patients receiving ODM per year. \nHowever, this will depend upon the initial selection \nof the probe and the prior clinical judgement as \nto how the patient will respond. Given the nature \nof the patient groups it might be expected that \nthe use of more than one probe would be more \ncommon among critically ill than surgical patients.\nIt is unclear how many patients might use \na monitor per year (i.e. how intensively the \nequipment is used) and what would be the optimal \nuse rate in a potential steady state. For instance, \nthe average length of stay in an ICU in Scotland\u2019s \nhospitals is 4.7 days31 (for an HDU it is 3.2 days). \nThis does not mean, however, that a particular \nmonitor would be used, on average, every 5 days \nas this would imply a full-time usage assumption \nChapter 5  \nEconomic modellingEconomic modelling\n30\nTABLE 13  Cost per year for ODM equipment (\u00a3) 2007\u20138\nConcept CardioQ CardioQPa\n1 Cost of monitor  8000 11,000\n2 Monitor lifetime (assumption)  5 years 5 years\n3 Yearly instalments 1600 2200\n4 Other yearly costs (maintenance and software) 1200 1200\n5 Total yearly cost 2800 3400\na   CardioQ supports only adult probes while CardioQP supports both adult and paediatric probes.\nTABLE 14  ODM equipment cost per patient (\u00a3) 2007\u20138\nConcept CardioQ CardioQPa\nMonitor cost per year  2800.00 3400.00\nAssumption\n(a) 36 patients per monitor per year 76.71 93.15\n(b) 125 patients per monitor per year 22.40 27.20\n(c) 500 patients per monitor per year 5.60 6.80\na  CardioQ supports only adult probes while CardioQP supports both adult and paediatric probes.\nfor this equipment. Moreover, patients receiving \ncritical care (within either an ICU or an HDU) \nwho require ODM might not be representative of \nthe whole population of patients receiving critical \ncare, and their length of stay may be higher or \nlower than the average. Given the absence of data \non the length of use of ODM, a simple assumption \ncan be made about the number of patients who \nmight be treated with a single monitor within a \ngiven year. For illustrative purposes, in this exercise \nthree usage rates per monitor per year have been \nconsidered (36, 125 and 500) to explore the impact \nof different levels of intensity of use (Table 14). \nThese figures result from an assumption of 250 \ndays of usage of equipment per year and different \nnumbers of patients treated (i.e. one patient every \n7 days, one patient every 2 days and two patients \nper day, respectively).\nTable 15 shows estimations of the total cost for \nODM equipment and probe per patient. Based \non the assumptions stated above and according to \nthe probe used the total equipment cost can range \nfrom around \u00a366 to \u00a3214 per patient.\nWhen estimating costs of a procedure it would be \nusual to include other categories of cost such as \nthe staff time involved. However, the marginal staff \ncost of using ODM may be minimal as the staff \nrequired to interpret the outputs of the monitor \nwill be there anyway. Furthermore, the time it takes \nto insert the probe and obtain the initial readings \nis also minimal (e.g. about 5 minutes; Dr Gordon \nHouston, July 2007, personal communication). \nOther direct costs associated with the procedure, \nsuch as ultrasound gel or other disposal materials, \nare negligible. As indicated in Chapter 4, one \ncategory of costs not included in these analyses \nis the cost of treatments incurred as a result of \nmonitoring. The net effect and magnitude of these \ncosts is uncertain.\nFurther estimation of \nthe implications for \ncost-effectiveness\nThis section explores the cost-effectiveness of \nODM for the different comparisons presented in \nChapters 3 and 4. The analyses focused on two \noutcomes: mortality and length of hospital stay. \nWorst- and best-case scenarios for the use of ODM \nwere constructed for each comparison. These \nscenarios differed in terms of the cost of ODM \nequipment (e.g. \u00a3214 for worst-case and \u00a366 for \nbest-case scenario, as reported in Table 15), and the \u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

For the worst-case scenario this was \ntaken to be equal to \u00a3310 per day (corresponding \nto the cost of a day in a general medical ward) and \nfor the best-case scenario the cost used was \u00a31680 \nper day, which corresponds to the cost of a day in \nan ICU.31 Finally, the mean length of survival per \nadditional survivor was taken to be 1 year for the \nworst-case scenario and 5 years for the best-case \nscenario. These numbers help to illustrate the \ntrade-offs that might be faced.\nResults are presented in terms of QALYs. For these \ncalculations a quality of life weight [as measured \nby the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions \n(EQ-5D) scale] at 12 months of 0.66 was used. This \nestimate is based on quality of life of ICU survivors \nat 12 months (lower than the 0.88 score that might \nbe estimated for the general population32).\nFinally, in order to allow for the statistical \nimprecision surrounding estimates of the \ndifferences in mean length of stay and survival, \nnormal and lognormal distributions, respectively, \nwere used to describe the uncertainty in these \nparameters. The data required to construct these \ndistributions were the estimated confidence \nintervals reported in Chapter 3 and, as such, the \nsame limitations as stated in Chapters 3 and 4 \napply to this economic evaluation exercise.\nHigh-risk surgical patients\nODM plus CVP plus conventional \nclinical assessment versus CVP plus \nconventional clinical assessment \nfor high-risk surgical patients\nTable 9 shows a balance sheet for the ODM \nplus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment versus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment comparison for \nhigh-risk surgical patients. In favour of ODM it \nshows reduction in mortality (OR 0.13, 95% CI \n0.02\u20130.96), reduction in major complications \n(OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04\u20130.31), reduction in total \ncomplications (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26\u20130.71) and \nreduction in length of hospital stay (WMD \u22121.82, \n95% CI \u22122.98 to \u22120.65). Conversely, favouring the \nnon-use of ODM there are the additional costs for \nODM and potentially increased management costs \nfor survivors due to a lower mortality rate in the \nODM group. With the cost calculations obtained \nfor ODM in the previous section and focusing on \nthe reduction in mortality, it is possible to illustrate \nthe extent of the increment in health-care costs and \nQALYs per additional survivor before ODM would \nnot be considered cost-effective at a \u00a330,000 per \nQALY threshold.33\nFigure 11 shows the results for ODM plus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \nversus CVP monitoring plus conventional clinical \nassessment for high-risk surgical patients. The \nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis was based on \n1000 iterations of a Monte Carlo analysis. The \nblack line represents the \u00a330,000 cost per QALY \nthreshold and the circles on the right and below \nthis line are iterations of the model that indicate \nthat the use of ODM would be cost-effective. The \nmore circles there are to the right of and below \nthe line the more likely it is that the use of ODM \nwould be cost-effective. The white circle in the \nmiddle of the black circle \u2018cloud\u2019 is the incremental \ncost-effectiveness based on the point estimates \nfor each of the parameters used in assessing cost-\neffectiveness.\nIt can be seen in Figure 11 that a great majority \nof the points lie within the second quadrant; this \nindicates that using ODM together with CVP Economic modelling\n32\n0\n0.1\n\u20138000\n4000\n2000\n\u20132000\n\u20134000\n\u20136000\n\u20130.5 \u20130.4 \u20130.3\nIncremental QALYs\nI\nn\nc\nr\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nl\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n \n(\n\u00a3\n)\n \n2\n0\n0\n6\n\u2013\n7\n\u20130.2 \u20130.1 0\nFIGURE 11  Incremental cost-effectiveness plane \u2013 best-case ODM scenario: ODM + CVP + conventional clinical assessment vs CVP \n+ conventional clinical assessment for high-risk surgical patients.\nmonitoring and conventional clinical assessment \nseems to be more effective and less costly than \nusing only CVP monitoring and conventional \nclinical assessment. A similar result can be observed \nin Figure 12 for the worst-case ODM scenario. \nNote that the cloud appears truncated on the \nright because of our assumption of a 1- or 5-year \nincrement to length of life for additional survivors.\nFigures 13 and 14 show the average extra cost per \nadditional survivor that would need to be incurred \nbefore ODM would no longer be considered \ncost-effective. In terms of Figures 11 and 12 this \nis equivalent to moving the circles upward and \ncrossing the \u00a330,000 threshold. For the best-\ncase scenario this mean that the extra cost per \nadditional survivor would be \u00a34441 (95% CI \n\u00a32151\u2013\u00a36732) and for the worst-case scenario the \nextra cost per additional survivor would be \u00a3642 \n(95% CI \u00a3225\u2013\u00a31060).\nCaution should be taken when reading these \nresults as calculations did not take into account the \nother issues favouring ODM (e.g. the reductions \nin complications that the calculations assume are \nfully captured by the reductions in length of stay \nand increases in survival). The incorporation of all \nthese factors into a full economic model might give \na better idea of the likelihood of ODM being cost-\neffective.\nFurther analysis was undertaken using data from \nthe AHRQ report on the difference in length of \nhospital stay. These data are more conservative \nthan those used above. A lognormal distribution \nwas attached to these data using the 95% CI, i.e. \n\u22122.21 to \u22120.57 days. The other data used in this \nmodel are the same as those used for the worst-case \nmodel presented above.\nThe great majority of points from the probabilistic \nsensitivity analysis lie in the second quadrant, \nwhere using ODM together with CVP monitoring \nand conventional clinical assessment seems to be \nmore effective and less costly than using only CVP \nmonitoring and conventional clinical assessment \n(Figure 15). However, should the mean incremental \ncost per additional survivor be \u00a3448 or more (95% \nCI \u00a3117\u2013\u00a3779) then the ODM-based strategy \nwould no longer be considered cost-effective \n(Figure 16).\nODM plus conventional clinical assessment \nversus CVP plus conventional clinical \nassessment for high-risk surgical patients\nUnfortunately, there are no feasible exercises for \nthis comparison as there are no data on which \ncalculations could be based. This means that it is \nnot possible to provide any sensible estimates of \nthe incremental costs and benefits of ODM for this \nclinical scenario.\nODM plus conventional clinical \nassessment versus conventional clinical \nassessment for high-risk surgical patients\nTable 11 shows the balance sheet for this \ncomparison.

The difference in \nmortality is not statistically significant as the \nconfidence intervals are sufficiently wide to favour \nany of the comparators (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.23\u2013\n2.77). The same analyses as used previously were \nundertaken in this case.\nFigures 17 and 18 show the results for best- and \nworst-case ODM scenarios, respectively.

The \nremainder of the iterations are mainly in the third \nquadrant, where ODM is both less costly and less \neffective. Consequently, cost-effectiveness for these \nresults will depend on how much society values the \nQALY gain from not using ODM.

Therefore, \nthe decision as to whether they are cost-effective \nis independent of the threshold.

However, it was \nnot possible to obtain quantitative results for all \nfour comparisons for which balance sheets were \nproduced in Chapter 4 and for those where it \nwas possible, results should be interpreted with \ncaution as the results presented in this chapter are \nsubject to the same caveats as those noted in earlier \nchapters.Economic modelling\n38\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n12413\nIncremental cost (\u00a3) 2006\u20137\nI\nn\nc\nr\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nl\n \nQ\nA\nL\nY\ns\n8782 5150 1519 \u20132113 \u20135744\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1915\nIncremental cost (\u00a3) 2006\u20137\nI\nn\nc\nr\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nl\n \nQ\nA\nL\nY\ns\n1145 376 \u2013394 \u20131163 \u20131933\nFIGURE 24  Histogram: extra NHS survival costs for ODM to stop being considered cost-effective \u2013 worst-case ODM scenario: ODM + \nCVP + conventional clinical assessment vs CVP + conventional clinical assessment for critically ill patients.\nFIGURE 23  Histogram: extra NHS survival costs for ODM to stop being considered cost-effective \u2013 best-case ODM scenario: ODM + \nCVP + conventional clinical assessment vs CVP + conventional clinical assessment for critically ill patients.\nFor high-risk patients we obtained quantitative \nresults for ODM plus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment versus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \nand for ODM plus conventional clinical assessment \nversus conventional clinical assessment. For \ncritically ill hospitalised patients we obtained \nquantitative results for ODM plus CVP monitoring \nplus conventional clinical assessment versus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \nonly. No quantitative results were obtained for \nODM plus conventional clinical assessment \nversus CVP monitoring plus conventional clinical \nassessment for high-risk surgical patients.\nAll the comparisons exploring the strategies that \ninvolved the use of ODM seem to have a reasonable \nchance of being considered cost-effective given the \nassumptions that we have made. However, these \nresults seem to be heavily dependent on the mean \ncost for the NHS of treating those extra survivors \nand on the cost of treatments incurred because \nof monitoring. The threshold value that these \ncosts would need to reach before ODM might not \nbe considered cost-effective ranged from \u00a3581 \nto \u00a311,600 depending on the comparison and \nthe underlying assumptions. It is not clear from \nthis current work whether or not costs of this \nmagnitude are likely to exist in practice.\nThere are further limitations to these analyses; the \nmain one, perhaps, being the partial modelling \napproach adopted here.

For instance, \nfactors such as the reduction in major and total \ncomplications are definitely in favour of ODM \n(i.e. higher quality of life for those not having \nthese major complications) for the ODM plus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \nwithin surgery comparison. Therefore, including \nthese into a full economic model would improve \nthe cost-effectiveness of ODM (however, part \nof the effect of complications within the model \nshould have been reflected within length of stay \ndifferences). For the other comparisons it is \nunclear what the effect would be of including these \nadditional factors into an economic model.\nFinally, as stated earlier in this report, the cost-\neffectiveness of any strategy depends on the \nalternative strategies with which it is being \ncompared. For this reason, a full economic model \nshould include all the relevant alternatives; these \nare all the potential relevant pathways of care that \ninclude and do not include ODM, as well as current \npractice.\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

A recent systematic review \nfocusing on the safety and effectiveness of ODM \nwas identified after this protocol was finalised but \nbefore the project was started. Following discussion \nwith the NCCHTA it was agreed that the Aberdeen \nTAR group should base its review on the evidence \ncontained in the AHRQ report, supplemented by \nany additional studies identified, should the AHRQ \nreport be judged to be of sufficiently high quality. \nHad the review been judged not to be good enough \nthis study would have followed the plan set out in \nour original protocol.\nStatement of \nprincipal findings\nReview of effectiveness\nThis review is based on the AHRQ report with \neight included RCTs, supplemented by two \nadditional RCTs identified, by the Aberdeen group \nthat assessed the effects of ODM-guided fluid \nadministration in patients during surgery (AHRQ \nreport key question 2) or during critical care \n(AHRQ report key question 3). Studies assessing \nODM in patients during surgery reported data for \nthree comparisons:\nODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional  1. \nclinical assessment versus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment (five studies \ninvolving 453 patients)\nODM plus conventional clinical assessment  2. \nversus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment (one study involving 61 \npatients)\nODM plus conventional clinical assessment  3. \nversus conventional clinical assessment (two \nAHRQ studies involving 99 patients and one \nadditional study involving 40 patients).\nNo studies were identified that compared different \nmethods of ODM.\nIt should be noted that cardiac and non-cardiac \nsurgery (major general, gynaecological, urological, \nvascular and orthopaedic surgery) are usually not \nconsidered together when analysing outcomes as \nthey are considered non-comparable groups of \npatients owing to differences in type of surgery and \npresence of co-morbidities, etc. In this study, the \nresults from the one study among cardiac surgery \npatients20 has been included in the review and \ngenerally reported results consistent with those \nfrom the other studies.\nStudies assessing ODM in patients in critical \ncare reported data for only one comparison: \nODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment versus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment (one AHRQ study \ninvolving 174 patients and one additional study \ninvolving 162 patients). The patient groups in \nthese two studies were quite different. One study \ninvestigated patients in a cardiac care unit post \ncardiac surgery, and the other focused on patients \nsuffering from major trauma.\nThe AHRQ report considered four outcomes: \nmortality, major complications, total complications \nand length of hospital stay; data were extracted \nfrom the additional studies on these four outcomes. \nData were also sought on a fifth outcome, quality of \nlife, from both the studies included in the AHRQ \nreport and the studies identified by our additional \nsearches.\nIn terms of total mortality, across all comparisons \nfewer patients in the ODM group died. The \nexceptions to this were the study by Venn and \ncolleagues23 comparing ODM plus conventional \nclinical assessment with conventional clinical \nassessment during surgery, and the study by \nMcKendry and colleagues19 comparing ODM \nplus CVP monitoring plus conventional clinical \nassessment with CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment following cardiac surgery. The \nAHRQ report stated that, as the total number \nof deaths was too low to allow pooling and none \nof the individual studies showed a statistically \nsignificant between-group difference, the evidence \nwas insufficient to allow conclusions to be reached \nconcerning relative mortality rates for any of the \nChapter 6  \nDiscussionDiscussion\n42\ncomparisons.6 A meta-analysis (Peto method) \nundertaken by the Aberdeen group of the five \nstudies reporting ODM plus CVP monitoring \nplus conventional clinical assessment versus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \ndid show statistically significantly fewer deaths in \nthe ODM group (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02\u20130.96). \nHowever, as the number of deaths was low and the \ntotal combined sample size was still modest, these \nresults should be interpreted with caution.\nMajor complications were only reported for one \ncomparison: ODM plus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment versus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \nfor patients undergoing surgery. All three studies \nreporting this outcome showed a statistically \nsignificant reduction in the rate of major \ncomplications and the AHRQ report stated that \nthe strength of evidence supporting this conclusion \nwas strong.6 A meta-analysis undertaken by the \nAberdeen group of the three studies reporting this \noutcome showed statistically significantly fewer \nmajor complications in the ODM group (OR 0.12, \n95% CI 0.04\u20130.31).\nIn terms of total complications, across all \ncomparisons fewer patients in the ODM group \nexperienced complications, with some studies \nshowing statistically significant differences. The \nAHRQ report stated that for the comparison of \nODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment versus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment in patients \nundergoing surgery, the ODM group experienced \na clinically significant reduction in the rate of total \ncomplications and that the strength of evidence \nsupporting this conclusion was strong.6 A meta-\nanalysis undertaken by the Aberdeen group of \nthe three studies reporting this outcome showed \nstatistically significantly fewer complications in the \nODM group (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26\u20130.71). The \nAHRQ stated that for all of the other comparisons \nno conclusions could be reached owing to the small \nnumber of studies reporting this outcome, with \nnone reporting a statistically significant between-\ngroup difference. However, for the comparison \nof ODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment versus CVP monitoring \nplus conventional clinical assessment during \nhospitalisation, including the additional study by \nChytra and colleagues25 with that of McKendry and \ncolleagues,19 a meta-analysis undertaken by the \nAberdeen group showed a statistically significant \nreduction in total complications in terms of patient \nnumbers in the ODM group (OR 0.49, 95% CI \n0.30\u20130.81).\nIn terms of length of hospital stay, the AHRQ \nreport stated that the comparison of ODM \nplus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment versus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment in patients \nundergoing surgery showed a reduced length of \nhospital stay for the ODM group, and that the \nstrength of evidence supporting this conclusion was \nstrong.6 The precise magnitude of the reduction \nis uncertain and the meta-analysis undertaken \nby the Aberdeen group reported in Chapter 3 \nfor this comparison needs to be interpreted very \ncautiously. The AHRQ report also stated that the \ncomparison of ODM plus conventional clinical \nassessment versus conventional clinical assessment \nduring surgery showed a reduced length of stay \nfor the ODM group, although the strength of \nevidence supporting this conclusion was weak.6 \nThe additional study by Dodd and colleagues26 \nalso reported a shorter length of stay for the ODM \ngroup.\nThe AHRQ report stated that because only one \nsmall study compared ODM plus conventional \nclinical assessment with CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment during surgery, \nand another small study compared ODM plus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \nwith CVP monitoring plus conventional clinical \nassessment during hospitalisation, no conclusions \nwere possible for these comparisons.6 However, \nalthough there was no statistical difference \nbetween the groups in the study reporting the \nformer comparison, for the latter comparison \nboth the study included in the AHRQ report and \nthe additional study by Chytra and colleagues25 \nreported a statistically significantly shorter median \nlength of hospital stay for the ODM group.\nThe AHRQ report also considered which ODM-\nrelated complications had been reported in the \nliterature (AHRQ report key question 4), with \nstudies of any design considered. Study designs \nother than RCTs were not considered eligible \nfor our review but collectively these different \nstudy designs provide a good indication of the \nsafety of ODM. Twenty-three studies addressed \nthis question, including four RCTs,17,21\u201323 18 case \nseries7,10,11,34\u201348 and one article containing two case \nreports.49 Three case series11,39,42 and the article \ncontaining two case reports49 reported minor \npatient-related complications associated with \noesophageal Doppler probes. Nineteen studies \ninvolving 654 patients specifically stated that there \nwere no ODM-related complications. The AHRQ \nreport stated that currently no serious adverse \nevents had been reported in the literature and \u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The \nremaining five studies (Dodd,26 Gan,18 McKendry,19 \nMythen20 and Wakeling24) made no mention of \nODM-related complications.\nNone of the studies reported quality of life data, \nalthough the study by Wakeling and colleagues24 \ndid state that the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-\nCR38 quality of life questionnaires, completed 4\u20136 \nweeks after surgery, showed no differences between \nthe groups.\nReview of cost-effectiveness\nNo economic evaluations relevant to this review \nwere identified. Information reported on the \nwebsite www.reducinglengthofstay.org.uk50 has \nsuggested that the use of ODM in one NHS \nhospital has saved approximately \u00a31M a year \nsince 2004, mainly as a result of the need for \nless postoperative care. The formal analyses \nunderpinning such information, however, are not \nreadily available. Nevertheless, despite the absence \nof formal evaluations, information was available \nfrom the review of effectiveness for measures of \neffectiveness and cost-generating events (e.g. \nlength of stay, risk of complications). These data, \nalong with some initial consideration of resources \nrequired to provide ODM or its alternatives, were \norganised in a series of balance sheets so that \nchoices and trade-offs between alternative courses \nof action could be highlighted.\nVery simply, these balance sheets show those factors \nthat favour the use of ODM and those factors that \nfavour the alternative. They also highlight those \nfactors for which we are currently unsure whether \nthey favour ODM or not. As highlighted above, \nthe evidence base for some comparisons is limited. \nIn the high-risk surgical patient population, from \nthe comparison of ODM plus CVP monitoring \nplus conventional clinical assessment with CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment, \nit appears likely that ODM is more effective and \nthat the savings made by a reduced length of stay \nwould more than offset the cost (in terms of staff, \nequipment and consumables) of the set-up and use \nof ODM. In terms of the comparison of ODM plus \nconventional clinical assessment with conventional \nclinical assessment alone, it is likely that the savings \nmade as a result of reduced hospitalisation would \noffset the costs of ODM. However, in this situation \nthe overall difference in costs and effectiveness is \nunclear as there is insufficient evidence regarding \nthe effect on mortality and complications. Where \ndata are available the confidence intervals \nare sufficiently wide to cover clinically and \neconomically important differences that might \nfavour either intervention. The balance sheet for \nthe comparison of ODM plus conventional clinical \nassessment with CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment really serves only to highlight \nthe need for more evidence with respect to this \ncomparison.\nWhere ODM might be used in the care of critically \nill patients, data were available for only one \ncomparison: ODM plus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment versus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment. \nFurthermore, the patient groups from the two \nidentified studies were different. One study \nconsidered patients cared for in a cardiac care unit \nfollowing cardiac surgery and the other considered \npatients with major trauma. For this comparison \nit is likely that the reductions in length of stay \nwould compensate for the cost of ODM and that \nthe use of ODM would reduce the incidence \nof complications, but the effect on mortality is \nuncertain.\nAlthough it has been argued that the use of ODM \nmay not be associated with a net increase in cost \nto the NHS, this is based on the assumption that \nthe savings associated with a reduced length of stay \ncan be freed up to pay for the ODM. In reality this \nis unlikely to happen, but the use of ODM does \nrelease the hospital beds for other patients. The \nnet financial cost of ODM is unclear at present, as \nalthough ODM equipment and consumables would \nneed to be purchased, fewer consumables and less \nequipment may be required for other monitoring \nand for the management of complications.\nNo evidence was identified relevant to the \ncomparison of pulse contour analysis monitoring. \nThis is not altogether surprising given the \nrelatively recent growth in this technology.\nEconomic modelling\nThe scope for a formal economic model was \nexplored using information from the balance \nsheets. It was plausible to develop partial models \nfor three of the four comparisons for which \nbalance sheets were constructed (ODM plus CVP Discussion\n44\nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \nversus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment, and ODM plus conventional \nclinical assessment versus conventional clinical \nassessment, for high-risk surgical patients; and \nODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment versus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment comparison only, \nfor critically ill hospitalised patients). These are \npartial models in the sense that they only take \ninto account differences in mortality and length of \nstay and do so only for those strategies compared \nin the balance sheets. Results were expressed in \nterms of additional cost per QALY gained and \nthe average extra cost per additional survivor that \nwould need to be incurred before ODM would no \nlonger be considered cost-effective. ODM best-case \nand worst-case scenarios were constructed and \nprobabilistic analyses conducted.\nFor the three comparisons the likelihood for the \nuse of ODM being cost-effective seems high given \nthe comparators and the underlying assumptions \nwithin the analyses (e.g. limitations and caveats of \nthe data used in the analyses). Results also depend \non the cost to the NHS of treating the extra \nsurvivors and the costs of interventions prompted \nby the monitoring. The magnitude that these \ncosts would need to reach before ODM might not \nbe considered cost-effective ranged from \u00a3581 to \n\u00a311,600 depending on the comparison and the \nunderlying assumptions.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe strengths of this review include the fact that \nthe AHRQ report upon which it is based is a high-\nquality study (scored as 5, \u2018minor bias\u2019 on the \nOxman and Guyatt systematic review checklist). \nAlso, an additional two studies were identified \nto add to the evidence base of the eight studies \nincluded in the AHRQ review. In addition, all \nincluded studies were RCTs, which are less prone to \nbias than non-randomised study designs, and the \noutcomes assessed were all patient related.\nAs noted above there may be some concerns about \ncombining data relating to cardiac surgery patients \nwith data relating to non-cardiac surgery patients. \nIn terms of the use of ODM during surgery the \nresults from both groups of patients are broadly \nconsistent. However, it is less clear whether it is \nappropriate to combine the data from the two \nstudies identified that considered using ODM \namong critically ill patients, as the patient groups \nin these two studies are different.\nIn terms of limitations, both the AHRQ report \nand this review excluded non-English language \nstudies. Of the eight studies included in the AHRQ \nreport and the two additional studies identified, \nfive involved fewer than 100 patients. Only 2 of \nthe 10 studies assessed ODM in critical illness. \nThe AHRQ review\u2019s outcomes were broadly similar \nto those included in the original protocol for this \nreview, with the exception of quality of life, which \nthe AHRQ report did not include as an outcome. \nHowever, none of the included studies assessing \nODM during surgery or postoperatively reported \nquality of life data.\nA limitation of the technology noted by Chytra \nand colleagues was that in their study of ODM \nduring critical illness it was difficult to keep the \nDoppler probe in the correct position without \nfrequent adjustments during the 12-hour period \nthat it was being assessed in the ICU.25 The \nauthors also found the 12-hour study protocol to \nbe time consuming and noted that it would not \nhave been feasible without the co-operation of \nnursing staff. Gan and colleagues stated that there \nwas a learning curve to achieve placement of the \nprobe to capture the maximal signal.18 A study by \nLefrant and colleagues recommended a period \nof training involving no more than 12 patients to \nensure reliability of cardiac output measurements \nby ODM. 7\nOther reviews of fluid optimisation interventions \nhave been published that reported patient-\nrelated outcomes. A Cochrane review by Price and \ncolleagues51 included RCTs comparing a fluid \noptimisation intervention with normal practice \nor with another fluid optimisation intervention in \npatients undergoing surgery to repair proximal \nfemoral fracture. The review included two \nstudies, by Sinclair and colleagues22 and Venn and \ncolleagues,23 both of which are included in the \nAHRQ report. The Cochrane review concluded \nthat invasive methods of fluid optimisation during \nsurgery may shorten hospital stay but that their \neffects on other important, patient-centred, longer-\nterm outcomes are uncertain.51\nA review by Bundgaard-Nielsen and colleagues52 \nassessed the influence of goal-directed therapy \non postoperative outcome. Nine studies met the \ninclusion criteria; the eight reporting ODM were \nthose included in the AHRQ report and the ninth \u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n45\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta13070  Health Technology Assessment 2009; Vol. 13: No. 7\nwas a study by Pearse and colleagues53 comparing \nLiDCO with CVP monitoring. Pearse and \ncolleagues53 concluded that goal-directed therapy \nreduces hospital stay, postoperative nausea and \nvomiting and complications, and facilitates faster \ngastrointestinal functional recovery.\nWith regard to the cost-effectiveness data the \nprimary limitation is the lack of existing studies, \nwhich restricts the analysis of cost-effectiveness. \nNevertheless, merely by organising the available \ndata some reasonably firm conclusions could be \ndrawn and the choices and trade-offs could be \nhighlighted. Any judgements that utilise these data \nshould consider the pros and cons for the use of \nODM as well as the importance of the considerable \nuncertainty surrounding the estimates of relative \neffectiveness. Currently, these judgements must \nbe based on the implicit valuation of these \nfactors, but a more explicit consideration could \nbe provided by using the available data within a \nmodelling exercise. Such an exercise was explored \nand involved the more formal consideration of \ncosts and partially incorporated the best available \nevidence on effectiveness. The added value of \nsuch work might be seen as limited for some \ncomparisons, such as ODM plus CVP monitoring \nand conventional clinical assessment versus \nplus CVP monitoring and conventional clinical \nassessment, where conclusions could potentially \nbe reached already. The modelling exercise \nincorporated some of the uncertainty around \neffectiveness estimates and shed some light on \nthe extent to which the use of ODM might be \nconsidered cost-effective. A full economic model \nmight serve further to inform the decision-making \nprocess by entirely incorporating other factors (e.g. \nnumber of major and\/or total complications) for all \nthe relevant alternatives, and not only employing \nthose pairwise comparisons considered in the \npartial modelling exercises. Cardiac monitoring \ncan be used in a variety of patient groups. It \nis possible that the cost-effectiveness (and the \neffectiveness) may differ between these groups. An \nindication for this is the evidence of heterogeneity \nidentified in Figure 7.\nUncertainties\nIn terms of the type of patients considered to be \nsuitable for ODM-guided fluid administration \nduring surgery, the AHRQ report stated that its \nconclusions applied only to patients undergoing \nsurgical procedures with an expected substantial \nblood loss or fluid shifts requiring fluid \nreplacement. The types of surgery performed \nin the seven AHRQ and one additional study \nassessing ODM during surgery included moderate- \nto high-risk procedures such as elective bowel \nsurgery, hip fracture repair surgery, elective \ncardiac surgery, elective general, urological \nor gynaecological surgery, and major general \nabdominal surgery.\nThe optimal period of ODM-guided fluid \nadministration once patients have been admitted \nto critical care following surgery is unclear. \nMcKendry and colleagues19 applied ODM-guided \nfluid administration for a period of 4 hours after \npatients were admitted to cardiac intensive care \nafter cardiac surgery, while Chytra and colleagues25 \nmonitored multiple-trauma patients with major \nblood loss for a period of 12 hours following \nadmission to the ICU.\nAll of the included studies involved unconscious \npatients, as ODM technologies currently in \npractice are unsuitable for use in postoperative \nawake patients. Although an ODM probe is now \nmanufactured for per-nasal passage in awake \npatients it has yet to be fully evaluated and \nno additional studies using such a probe were \nidentified that met our inclusion criteria.\nIn terms of cost-effectiveness, limited data are \ncurrently available. While it may be possible to \ndraw some sensible conclusions about the use of \nODM, additional research may be useful both in \nterms of using the available data more fully in an \neconomic modelling exercise and to fill gaps in the \nprimary research evidence.\nOther relevant factors\nPotentially relevant studies identified from a search \nof the National Research Register are listed in \nAppendix 9. The largest of the ongoing studies \nis a French multicentre study (Cholley) that is \nscheduled to run from April 2007 to April 2010. \nThis study was also mentioned in the AHRQ \nreport. The aim of the study is to assess whether \nintraoperative fluid supplementation to improve \ntissue perfusion can reduce the incidence of \npostoperative complications in elderly patients \nwith hip fracture. The study design is described as \nrandomised, double-blind and placebo controlled. \nThe primary end point is to demonstrate that \ncolloid titration, guided using oesophageal Discussion\n46\nDoppler estimation of stroke volume, during the \nsurgical repair of hip fracture reduces the incidence \nof postoperative complications. Secondary end \npoints include (a) delay to walking without help; \n(b) increased number of days \u2018out of hospital\u2019 at \n3 months after the fracture; and (c) mortality at 1 \nyear. The protocol for the study indicated that 19 \ncentres would be participating and that the aim \nwas to recruit 800 patients. This will be the largest \nstudy of ODM during surgery to date and its results \nshould add substantially to the existing evidence \nbase.\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Therefore, the use of ODM might be \nconsidered safe.\nEffectiveness and cost-\neffectiveness\nThe evidence base on effectiveness, based on the \nrandomised evidence, is limited. Furthermore, \nthere are no published cost-effectiveness analyses. \nNevertheless, despite the limited evidence it \nis possible to draw out some implications for \npractice. These have been grouped around the \nfour strategies for the use of ODM that have been \nconsidered.\nUse of ODM for high-risk surgical patients\nEvidence for three different comparisons involving \nthe use or non-use of ODM in this group of \npatients was available and in all three cases \nappeared relevant to the NHS. The available \nevidence from five studies involving 453 patients \nsuggests that the addition of ODM-guided \nfluid administration to CVP monitoring plus \nconventional assessment during surgery results in \nfewer major and total complications and a shorter \nlength of hospital stay, and possibly fewer deaths, \nwith pooled estimates for all outcomes showing a \nstatistically significant difference in favour of the \nODM group. Given these data it is quite plausible \nthat the use of ODM in this situation would be less \ncostly and more effective.\nFor the single study (n = 61) reporting ODM plus \nconventional assessment versus CVP monitoring \nplus conventional assessment during surgery, \nalthough all of the outcomes reported favoured \nthe ODM group none were statistically significant. \nTherefore, no conclusions are possible for any \nof the outcomes reported in this comparison. \nInsufficient evidence is available to draw any \nrobust conclusions about cost-effectiveness for this \ncomparison.\nNone of the three studies (n = 139) reporting \nODM plus conventional clinical assessment versus \nconventional clinical assessment during surgery \nshowed a statistically significant difference for \nmortality; none reported the outcome of major \ncomplications; one reported total complications \n(a non-statistical difference favouring the ODM \ngroup); and all three reported a shorter length \nof stay for the ODM group, reaching statistical \nsignificance in one study. The addition of ODM to \nconventional assessment during surgery may lead \nto a shorter length of hospital stay. However, this \nconclusion is based on limited evidence from only \nthree small studies and no conclusions are possible \nfor the other outcomes. Again, only limited \nevidence is available on the cost-effectiveness \nof using ODM in this situation. On balance it \nwould appear likely that the cost of ODM would \nbe more than compensated for by the reduction \nin length of stay. However, the overall effect on \ncosts is uncertain. As described above, owing \nto the limited evidence, firm data on measures \nof clinical effectiveness (some of which are also \ncost drivers) are not available. Therefore, should \nODM be adopted, a judgement would be needed \non whether the trends in favour, observed for \nother comparisons, would be maintained for this \ncomparison.\nSummary of evidence for \nthe use of ODM in high-risk \nsurgical patients in the NHS\nThe addition of ODM-guided fluid administration \ncombined with CVP monitoring plus conventional \nassessment during major surgery results in fewer \ncomplications, a shorter length of hospital stay and \npossibly fewer deaths, and may be a cost-effective \nuse of resources in the NHS.\nUse of ODM in the critically ill\nNeither of the two studies (n = 336) reporting \nODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment versus CVP monitoring \nplus conventional clinical assessment during \nhospitalisation showed a statistically significant \ndifference in mortality, and neither reported \nmajor complications; therefore, no conclusions are \npossible for these outcomes. However, the addition \nof ODM to CVP monitoring plus conventional \nChapter 7  \nConclusionsConclusions\n48\nassessment may lead to fewer total complications \nand a shorter length of hospital stay. In a meta-\nanalysis of the outcome of total complications, the \npooled estimate showed a statistically significant \ndifference in favour of the ODM group. Both \nstudies also reported a statistically significantly \nshorter median length of stay in favour of the \nODM group. However, the evidence for these two \noutcomes should be treated with caution as it is \nbased on only two studies. Taking this evidence at \nface value, it would seem likely that the reduction \nin length of stay would compensate for the cost \nof using ODM. Furthermore, it seems likely \nthat the use of ODM would be associated with a \nreduced cost of managing complications (as well \nas with increased benefit to the patient). Again, \nhowever, should ODM be adopted, a judgement \nwould be required on whether the reduction in \nmortality observed for other uses of ODM would \nbe continued in this setting. A prior judgement is \nrequired on whether the evidence base available is \nsufficient.\nSummary of evidence for \nthe use of ODM in critically \nill patients in the NHS\nAlthough there is some evidence for reduced \ncomplication rates and hospital lengths of stay \nin subgroups of critically ill patients, there is \ninsufficient evidence to recommend the widespread \nuse of ODM in critically ill patients in the NHS.\nRecommendations \nfor research\nSurgery\nWell-designed multicentre RCTs are required \nto address the following questions related to \nperioperative patients with expected substantial \nblood loss or fluid shifts requiring fluid \nreplacement and\/or with major co-morbidity:\nDoes ODM-guided fluid therapy plus  \u2022\t\nconventional clinical assessment improve \noutcome compared with conventional clinical \nassessment during major surgery?\nDoes ODM-guided fluid therapy plus  \u2022\t\nconventional clinical assessment plus or minus \nCVP monitoring improve outcome compared \nwith CVP monitoring plus conventional clinical \nassessment during major surgery?\nStudies should have a follow-up period of at least 6 \nmonths and should report the following outcomes: \nmortality (hospital and longer term); length of \nstay [hospital, critical care (ICU and HDU)]; days \nof organ support in ICU and HDU; complications \n(major, total, technology-related); and quality of life \nin months after hospital discharge.\nFurther research is required to assess the \nadditional benefit, if any, of ODM-guided fluid \nadministration during surgery and continuing \ninto the early postoperative period versus ODM-\nguided fluid administration during surgery alone. \nFurther research is also required to determine the \noptimal number of hours for ODM-guided fluid \nadministration to continue after surgery once the \npatient has been admitted to a critical care facility.\nGiven the paucity of the existing economic \nevidence base, any further primary research should \ninclude an economic evaluation or should provide \ndata suitable for use in an economic model.\nCritical illness\nA well-designed multicentre RCT is required to \naddress the following question related to subgroups \nof critically ill patients, particularly those with \nmajor trauma and septic shock: \nDoes ODM-guided fluid therapy plus  \u2022\t\nconventional clinical assessment plus or minus \nCVP monitoring improve outcome compared \nwith CVP monitoring plus conventional clinical \nassessment in critical illness?\nStudies should have a follow-up period of at \nleast 6 months and should report the following \noutcomes: mortality (critical care, hospital and \nlonger term); length of stay [hospital; critical care \n(ICU and HDU)]; days of organ support in ICU \nand HDU; complications (major, total, technology-\nrelated); and quality of life in months after hospital \ndischarge. \nAgain, economic evaluations should be conducted \nas part of this primary research or, at the very least, \nfurther primary research should seek to provide \ndata that can be used in an economic model.\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Until recently the main \nmethod used to measure heart function has been \npulmonary artery catheterisation, although for \npeople undergoing surgery even this approach is \nuncommon. While providing useful information, \nPACs have not been shown to improve mortality. \nThis, coupled with concerns over procedural \ncomplications associated with the use of these \ncatheters along with the development of less \ncomplex heart monitors, has resulted in a global \ndecline in the usage of PACs over recent years.\nThis review will assess the effectiveness and cost-\neffectiveness of ODM when used for monitoring \nheart function in comparison with (a) standard \ncare (i.e. no cardiac output monitor perioperatively \namong patients undergoing major surgery; and \n(b) other methods of monitoring heart function \nsuch as pulmonary artery catheterisation or pulse \ncontour monitoring devices in critically ill patients \nor in patients undergoing major surgery.\nThe analysis will focus on outcomes of most \nimportance to patients (e.g. mortality, length of \nhospitalisation, length of stay in critical care, days \nof organ support in ICU and complications). Cost-\neffectiveness will be assessed from the perspective \nof the NHS and personal social services.\nInformation on the relative effectiveness of \nthe alternative interventions will be derived by \nsystematically reviewing relevant RCTs comparing \nODM with: (a) standard care (i.e. no cardiac \noutput monitor perioperatively among patients \nundergoing major surgery); and (b) other methods \nof monitoring heart function as outlined above. \nInformation on cost-effectiveness will initially be \nassessed using a systematic review of economic \nevaluations comparing ODM with the relevant \ncomparators for the two patient groups specified.\nDecision problem\nOptimal management of cardiac output and \nhaemodynamic status have long been considered \nkey to improving outcome in critically ill patients \nand in high-risk patients undergoing major \nsurgery. Traditionally, PACs have been used to \nmonitor cardiac output and haemodynamic status \nand to guide treatment. A recent HTA Programme-\nfunded study demonstrated that PAC insertion \nAppendix 1  \nAberdeen TAR group protocol for systematic \nreview of oesophageal Doppler monitoringAppendix 1\n56\nand management of critically ill patients using \nthe parameters monitored by pulmonary artery \ncatheterisation fails to confer an outcome benefit. \nFurther studies have also cast doubt on the value \nof PACs in high-risk major surgery.2 This, coupled \nwith concerns related to procedural complications \nassociated with the insertion and use of the PAC \nalong with the development and assimilation of \nless invasive cardiac output monitors in clinical \npractice, has resulted in a global decline in the \nusage of the PAC in recent years.\nLess invasive technologies to monitor cardiac \noutput and other haemodynamic parameters \ninclude ODM and systems based on pulse contour \nanalysis and dye dilution methods. Oesophageal \nDoppler monitoring measures blood flow velocity \nin the descending thoracic aorta using a flexible \nultrasonic probe inserted into the patient\u2019s \noesophagus. This information is combined with \nan estimate of aortic cross-sectional area (derived \nfrom the patient\u2019s age, height and weight), allowing \nhaemodynamic variables to be calculated.\nPulse contour analysis devices employ algorithms \nto perform real-time continuous monitoring of \ncardiac output using arterial pulse contour analysis. \nThere are several types of device available, but all \nrequire initial calibration which may be by means of \neither transpulmonary thermodilution or lithium \ndilution techniques.\nInformation on the relative effectiveness of \nthe alternative interventions will be derived \nby systematically reviewing relevant RCTs. \nInformation on cost-effectiveness will be assessed \nusing a systematic review of economic evaluations \nof the alternative methods.\nReport methods for synthesis of \nevidence of clinical effectiveness\nA review of the evidence for clinical effectiveness \nwill be undertaken systematically following the \ngeneral principles recommended in the QUOROM \nstatement (URL: www.consort-statement.org\/\nQUOROM.pdf).\nNature of existing evidence base and \njustification of approach taken\nThere are at least two existing reviews of ODM. \nThese reviews are not systematic in that they \ndid not use a search strategy likely to identify \nall relevant studies. They compared ODM \nprimarily with pulmonary artery catheterisation \nand focused on measures of cardiac output. \nHowever, it is recognised that pulmonary artery \ncatheterisation is an inappropriate gold standard \nfor the measurement of cardiac output1 and the \nrelationship between these surrogate measures \nand patient outcomes is unclear. Furthermore, \nas indicated above, the use of PACs is becoming \nless common while use of other less invasive \ncardiac monitoring methods is increasing. For \nthese reasons, we do not propose to update these \nexisting reviews; rather we aim to complete a new \nsystematic review of ODM compared with relevant \ncomparators (including other new methods of \nmeasuring heart function) which will focus on the \noutcomes of most importance to patients.\nPopulation\nInclusion criteria:\nadults being managed in critical care who  \u2022\t\nrequire cardiac monitoring\nadults during major surgery. \u2022\t\nExclusion criteria:\nuse of ODM in patient groups other than those  \u2022\t\nspecified above\nstudies in which ODM was used as a measure of  \u2022\t\nstudy outcome rather than as a monitoring tool \nleading to a clinical intervention.\nRelevant subgroups:\npatients with sepsis versus those without sepsis. \u2022\t\nInterventions\nOesophageal Doppler monitoring (ODM). \u2022\t\nComparator\nFor both patient groups:\nno cardiac monitoring \u2022\t\nPACs \u2022\t\npulse contour analysis monitoring \u2022\t\nlithium dilution cardiac monitors (i.e. LiDCO  \u2022\t\nmonitor)\nthermodilution cardiac monitors (i.e. PiCCO  \u2022\t\nmonitor).\nOutcomes\nThere is no generally recognised gold standard for \nthe measurement of cardiac output, and for this \nreason we are focusing on patient-related outcomes \nrather than diagnostic performance.\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

In addition, they focus on diagnostic \nperformance rather than on the impact on clinical \nmanagement and patient-centred outcomes. Such \ncomparisons may be misleading as PACs cannot \nbe considered to be a gold standard. It is for \nthis reason that our search strategy will focus on \nidentifying RCTs that compare management based \non ODM with management without monitoring or \nwith an alternative method of monitoring. (Scoping \nsearches indicate that there may be RCTs meeting \nour inclusion criteria; however, if when conducting \nthe review no RCTs are found that meet our criteria \nthen consideration will be given to including data \nfrom non-randomised designs.)\nThe search strategy will involve searches of \nelectronic databases and relevant professional and \nmanufacturers\u2019 websites.\nElectronic searches will be conducted to identify \nreports of published and ongoing studies, \nincluding previous systematic reviews, on the \neffectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ODM. \nSearches will be carried out for the time period \n1990 to the present, for full papers only. English \nlanguage papers only will be considered eligible for \ninclusion; however, studies published in languages \nother than English will be noted. Databases to \nbe searched are listed in Table 16. Preliminary \nMEDLINE search strategies to be used are given in \nProtocol Appendix 1 and will be adapted for use in \nthe other databases.\nCurrent research registers, including the National \nResearch Register, Current Controlled Trials and \nClinical Trials will be searched.\nInclusion criteria\nFor the review of clinical effectiveness, only RCTs \nwill be included. Data will be systematically \nassembled and quality will be assessed using \ncriteria relevant to each type of outcome. Titles \nand abstracts will be examined for inclusion by one \nreviewer.

Full text copies of all \npotentially relevant reports will be obtained. \nOne reviewer will assess studies for inclusion and \nextract data using a standard data extraction \nform (see Protocol Appendix 2). Any uncertainty \nwill be resolved by discussion with a second \nreviewer and any disagreements will be resolved \nby arbitration by a third party. Information will be \nrecorded on year of publication; source of funding; \nstudy design; methods prior to randomisation \n(e.g. stratification); method of randomisation; \nconcealment of allocation; blinding procedures; \nnumber and characteristics of participants; \nduration of interventions; choice of outcome \nmeasures; and length of follow-up. Care will be \ntaken to avoid double counting due to multiple \nreports of the same data set. The reviewer will not \nbe blinded to authors, institutions or publications. \nWhere there is insufficient information in the \npublished report, no attempt will be made to \ncontact the authors for clarification because of time \nconstraints.\nQuality assessment strategy\nThe study quality of RCTs will be assessed using \nthe Delphi criteria list (see Protocol Appendix 3), \nadapted from Verhagen and colleagues.13\nMethods of analysis\/synthesis\nFor trials with multiple publications, only the most \nup-to-date or complete data for each outcome will \nbe included. Where appropriate, meta-analysis will \nbe employed to estimate a summary measure of \neffect on relevant outcomes based on intention-\nto-treat analyses. Dichotomous outcome data will \nbe combined using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel relative \nrisk method and continuous outcomes will be \ncombined using the inverse variance weighted \nmean difference method. The 95% confidence \nintervals and p-values will be calculated for the \nestimates of RR and WMD. The results will be \nreported using a fixed-effects model. Chi-squared \ntests and I2 statistics will be used to explore \nstatistical heterogeneity across studies. Possible \nreasons for heterogeneity will be explored using \nsensitivity analysis. Where there is no clear \nreason for heterogeneity, the implications will \nbe explored using random-effects methods. \nWhere a quantitative synthesis is considered to be \ninappropriate or not feasible, a narrative synthesis \nof results will be provided. If a lack of uniformity \nof the data is present in many studies, a qualitative \nreview to look for consistency between studies will \nbe performed. This will be supplemented, where \nappropriate, by investigation of the consistency in \nthe direction of the results using the Sign test.16\nLength of hospital stay will be defined as time from \nadmission to discharge or death and length of ICU \nwill be defined as time from admission to discharge \nfrom ICU or death in ICU. Length of stay data will \nonly be interpreted in the light of the mortality \ndata.\nSystematic review of existing \neconomic evaluations\nThe cost-effectiveness of ODM will be addressed \nby conducting a systematic review of economic \nevaluations of ODM against potential relevant \ncomparators and for the pertinent patient \ngroups as described above. Searches for this \nwill be adapted to those used for the systematic \nreview of clinical effectiveness but tailored to find \nrelevant economic evaluation studies. Non-English \nlanguage studies will be excluded except where an \nNHS EED English language abstract is available. In \nthis situation the NHS EED abstract will be used as \nthe primary reference.\nOne reviewer will assess all abstracts for relevance \nand will ask for full papers to be obtained for those \nthat appear to be potentially relevant. Studies that \ncompare relevant alternatives in terms of their \ncost and effects will be included in the analysis. \nOne economist will assess included studies using \nwell-known guidelines for economic evaluation \nassessment.30,54 These guidelines address all the \nimportant issues that should be reported when \nconducting an economic evaluation in health \ncare. No attempt will be made to synthesise \nquantitatively the identified primary studies.\nThe following data will be extracted for each \nincluded study:\nStudy characteristics (research question; study  1. \ndesign; comparison; setting; basis of costing)\nCharacteristics of the study population  2. \n(numbers receiving or randomised to each \nintervention; other systematic differences \nin clinical management; inclusion\/exclusion \ncriteria; dates to which data on effectiveness \nand costs are related)\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The \nstructure of such a model would be informed by \nadvice from our clinical collaborators and would be \nparameterised using the best available UK-relevant \ndata. However, owing to the very short duration of \nthe present TAR, we cannot anticipate that a full \nnew economic evaluation will be conducted.\nExpertise in this TAR team\nThe TAR team is experienced in conducting \nreviews of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions \nin both the clinical and technical aspects required \nto address the commissioning brief.

Four key questions were addressed:\nWhat types of devices\/techniques are currently  1. \nused to assess cardiac output?\nDoes therapeutic management based on  2. \noesophageal Doppler ultrasound-based \ncardiac output monitoring during surgery \nlead to improved patient outcomes (fewer \ncomplications and shorter hospital stay) \ncompared with:\nPulmonary artery catheter-based  i. \nmeasurement of cardiac output via \nthermodilution?\nCatheter-based measurement of central  ii. \nvenous pressure (CVP)?\nConventional clinical assessment (physical  iii. \nexamination, fluid input and output \nmeasurements)?\nDoes therapeutic management based on  3. \noesophageal Doppler ultrasound-based cardiac \noutput monitoring during hospitalisation \nlead to improved patient outcomes (fewer \ncomplications and shorter hospital stay) \ncompared with:\nPulmonary artery catheter-based  i. \nmeasurement of cardiac output via \nthermodilution?\nCatheter-based measurement of central  ii. \nvenous pressure (CVP)?\nConventional clinical assessment (physical  iii. \nexamination, fluid input and output \nmeasurements)?\nWhat complications, harms, and adverse  4. \nevents associated with oesophageal Doppler \nultrasound-based monitoring have been \nreported?\nTwenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria \nfor at least one key question. The ODM devices \nevaluated in the review included CardioQ (Deltex \nAppendix 2  \nAberdeen TAR group critique of the AHRQ \nreport, using the Database of Abstracts of \nReviews of Effectiveness (DARE) criteria\nMedical Ltd., UK), HemoSonic 100 (Arrow \nInternational, USA) and TECO (Medicina Ltd., \nUK, but no longer commercially available). Earlier \nmodels of these devices were also included. The \nreview focused on patient-orientated outcomes.\nThe authors\u2019 conclusions were:\nQ1. Methods used to monitor cardiac output \nin patients during surgery or intensive care. \nThese methods include thermodilution, dye \ndilution, lithium dilution, methods using the \nFick principle, pulse contour methods, thoracic \nelectrical bioimpedance, transoesophageal \nechocardiography, oesophageal Doppler \nmonitoring and ultrasonic cardiac output \nmonitoring.\nQ2. Seven publications with 583 patients addressed \nthis question. None of the studies compared \nODM with thermodilution. Five studies were of \nODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment versus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment. Two studies were \nof ODM plus conventional clinical assessment \nversus conventional clinical assessment alone.\nThe addition of ODM for guided fluid replacement \nto a protocol using CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment during surgery \nleads to a clinically significant reduction in the rate \nof major complications and total complications in \nsurgical patients compared with CVP monitoring \nplus conventional clinical assessment. The strength \nof evidence supporting this finding is strong.\nThe addition of ODM to the protocol described \nabove also reduces the length of hospital stay for \nsurgical patients (clinical significance uncertain). \nThe strength of evidence supporting this finding is \nstrong.\nOnly one study compared ODM plus conventional \nclinical assessment with CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment. Because this was Appendix 2\n68\none small study with non-informative effect sizes, \nno evidence-based conclusions were possible for \nany of the outcomes of interest.\nThe addition of ODM for guided fluid replacement \nto conventional clinical assessment during \nsurgery leads to a clinically significant reduction \nin the length of hospital stay compared with that \nassociated with conventional clinical assessment \nalone. The strength of evidence supporting this \nfinding is weak.\nThe evidence was insufficient to allow conclusions \nto be reached concerning relative mortality rates \nfor any of the comparisons in key question 2.\nThe conclusions for key question 2 apply only \nto patients undergoing surgical procedures with \nan expected substantial blood loss or fluid shifts \nrequiring fluid replacement.\nQ3. One study addressed this question, comparing \nODM plus CVP monitoring plus conventional \nclinical assessment with CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment for optimisation of \nintravenous fluid replacement in patients admitted \nto intensive care following cardiac surgery. This \nwas a single small study without a demonstrably \nlarge treatment effect on the outcomes of interest. \nTherefore, no conclusions could be drawn for this \nquestion.\nQ4. Currently, no serious adverse events associated \nwith oesophageal Doppler probes have been \nreported in the literature or in adverse event \ndatabases. The only minor events identified \nincluded two cases of incorrect probe placement \nin the left main bronchus, one case of incorrect \nplacement in the trachea, a tube displacement \nduring probe removal and an unspecified number \nof cases of minimal trauma in the buccal cavity \nduring probe placement. Nineteen studies with \na total of 654 patients specifically stated that \noesophageal Doppler probes did not cause any \ncomplications. The number of patients represented \nin these studies is relatively small. However, the \navailable evidence suggests that oesophageal \nDoppler probes are relatively low-risk devices, \nas reporting of even minor morbidity has been \ninfrequent thus far.\nAuthors\u2019 objective\nThe authors\u2019 objective was to provide a report to \ninform the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices of the evidence regarding oesophageal \nDoppler ultrasound-based monitoring of cardiac \noutput.\nSpecific interventions \nincluded in the review\nFor key questions 2 and 3, ODM was compared \nwith a standard of care, ideally catheter-based \nmeasurements of cardiac output or CVP, but also \nincluding other conventional clinical assessments.\nThe AHRQ report stated that transoesophageal \nechocardiography (TEE) with Doppler differs \nfrom ODM in that TEE requires more training to \noperate and is more expensive. TEE systems were \nbeyond the scope of the AHRQ report.\nParticipants included \nin the review\nThe participants were patients undergoing surgery \n(key question 2), or during hospitalisation (key \nquestion 3) or either (key question 4).\nThe authors noted that inclusion\/exclusion criteria \nand patient characteristics described in studies \nof cardiac output monitoring suggested that the \ntarget population was relatively high-risk patients \nundergoing major surgical procedures such as \nbowel resection, hip fracture repair or cardiac \nsurgery, with a significant anticipated blood loss, \nor patients in intensive care. The authors stated \nthat cardiac output-guided fluid replacement is not \ngenerally considered for low-risk patients having \nambulatory surgery.\nThe participant inclusion criterion did not apply to \nkey question 1, which was concerned with the types \nof device used to measure cardiac output.\nOutcomes assessed in the review\nFor key questions 2 and 3, mortality, major \ncomplications, total complications and length of \nhospital stay were the main outcome measures. \nFor key question 4, all outcomes reported \ncomplications that may be related to use of \noesophageal Doppler ultrasound devices. The \nreport evaluated only patient-orientated outcomes.\nStudy designs of evaluations \nincluded in the review\nStudies were included if they were English \nlanguage, addressed one of the four key questions, \nwere published as full journal articles and, for \u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

If the same study was reported \nin multiple publications, only the most recent \npublication was included.\nIn addition:\nFor key question 1 clinical guidelines, review \narticles and US Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) approvals were used to identify other \nmethods of cardiac output monitoring.\nFor key questions 2 and 3, studies had to involve \na parallel group design with a head-to-head \ncomparison of ODM with standard-of-care \nmonitoring in separate patients. Within a given \ntrial, patients in both groups must have received \ncomparable surgery (key question 2) or must have \nhad comparable diagnoses (key question 3). Studies \nperforming a mixed analysis of surgical and non-\nsurgical patients were excluded, as such studies \ncould not answer key question 2 or 3.\nFor key question 4, studies of any design \n(controlled trials, case series, case reports), the \nECRI\u2019s Health Device Alerts database and other \nadverse event databases were examined for reports \nof complications, harms and adverse events. These \nsources could not be used to determine causality or \nto estimate frequency of adverse events, but were \nused to generate a list of adverse events possibly \nattributable to the technology.\nWhat sources were searched \nto identify primary studies?\nThe original search was to June 2006, followed by \nan updated search to September 2006.\nElectronic database searches\nSeventeen external and internal databases were \nsearched: MEDLINE (1966 to 11 September \n2006), EMBASE (1974 to 11 September 2006), The \nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue \n3, 2006), The Cochrane Database of Methodology \nReviews (Issue 3, 2006), The Cochrane Central \nRegister of Controlled Trials (Issue 3, 2006), \nDatabase of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness \n(Issue 3, 2006), CINAHL (1982 to 11 September \n2006), ECRI Health Devices Alerts (1977 to 7 June \n2006), ECRI International Health Technology \nAssessment (inception to 7 June 2006), ECRI \nLibrary Catalog (inception to March 2006), Health \nTechnology Assessment Database (inception to \nIssue 3, 2006), metaRegister of Controlled Trials \n(14 June 2006), PubMed (1 September 2006), NHS \nEconomic Evaluation Database (inception to Issue \n3, 2006), US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Web \nsite (inception to 19 June 2006), US Food and Drug \nAdministration (adverse event reports) (1977 to 7 \nJune 2006), US National Guideline Clearinghouse \n(14 June 2006).\nHand searches of journal and \nnon-journal literature\nOver 1600 journals and supplements maintained \nin the ECRI\u2019s collections were routinely reviewed. \nNon-journal publications and conference \nproceedings from professional organisations, \nprivate agencies and government agencies were \nalso screened. Other mechanisms used to retrieve \nadditional relevant information included review of \nbibliographies\/reference lists from peer-reviewed \nand grey literature.\nOnly published, peer-reviewed, English language \nfull text articles were considered for inclusion in \nthe review.\nValidity assessment\nQuality assessment of studies included for key \nquestions 2 and 2 was undertaken using an ECRI \n25-question tool. Questions were worded so that \nstudy design aspects that provided evidence with \ngood internal validity resulted in \u2018Yes\u2019 answers, \ndesign aspects that created potential for bias \nresulted in \u2018No\u2019 answers and design aspects that \nwere inadequately described resulted in an answer \nof \u2018NR\u2019 (not reported). The tool considered the \ncomparability of the groups at baseline, blinding, \noutcome measurement, treatment and investigator \nbias. These items were used to compute a \nsummary score, where 10 indicated an ideal study \nand 0 indicated a study of the poorest possible \nquality. Studies that scored < 5 were considered \nunacceptable quality, those scoring > 5 but \u2264\u20096.7 \nwere considered low quality, those that scored > 6.7 \nbut \u2264\u20098.4 were considered moderate quality and \nstudies scoring \u2265\u20098.5 were considered high quality.\nThe number of reviewers conducting the quality \nassessment was not stated.\nThe information used for key question 1 was not \nformally evaluated. The quality of the evidence for \nkey question 4 was not formally evaluated as the \nintent of the question was simply to list reported \nharms of oesophageal Doppler ultrasound probes \nfrom any available data sources.Appendix 2\n70\nHow were decisions on \nthe relevance of primary \nstudies made?\nFrom 317 potentially relevant citations identified, \n75 full text articles were retrieved. Each article was \nread to determine whether it met a set of general \nand question-specific a priori inclusion criteria. \nTwenty-seven of the retrieved articles met the \ninclusion criteria for at least one key question, and \nfour addressed more than one key question. Seven \nincluded studies addressed key question 2, one \naddressed key question 3 and 23 addressed key \nquestion 4. The authors stated that as key question \n1 was a survey of current techniques rather than \nan evaluation of evidence the papers addressing \nit were not included in the above figures. The \nnumber of reviewers who selected reports for \ninclusion was not stated.\nHow were the data extracted \nfrom the primary studies?\nData were extracted that described patient \ninclusion\/exclusion criteria, design details \n(prospective, blinding status, etc), information on \nenrolled patients (demographics, underlying risk, \netc), and study results. When study authors did not \nreport dichotomous data as percentages, these were \ncomputed. Only outcome data relevant to the key \nquestions in the report were extracted. The number \nof reviewers who extracted data was not stated.\nNumber of studies included\nAs key question 1 required a summary of the \ntechnologies used to measure cardiac output, it \nwas derived primarily from review articles written \nby experts in the field and was not truly evidence \nbased, and the number of studies providing \ninformation for this question was not reported. \nSeven studies (n = 583) were included for key \nquestion 2, one study (n = 174) was included for \nkey question 3 and 23 studies were included for \nkey question 4. Because the intent of key question \n4 was simply to list reported harms of oesophageal \nDoppler ultrasound probes from any available \ndata source, details of study participants were not \nreported.\nHow were the studies combined?\nIndividual study effect sizes were calculated \nfrom dichotomous data using the log odds ratio \n(summary log odds ratios were converted to odds \nratios in the text and conclusion statements). If \nthere were no events in one of the study groups, \nthe Peto log odds and odds ratios were used. Effect \nsizes for continuous data were calculated in the \noriginal metric.\nIn some instances, certain studies presented data \nfor a continuous outcome (length of hospital stay) \nin a form that did not allow calculation of a precise \neffect size. Whereas accurate calculation of an effect \nrequires means and standard deviations or 95% \nconfidence intervals, some studies report length \nof stay as medians and ranges. The authors based \ntheir primary analysis of length of stay on medians \nand ranges when available, arguing that in some \nstudies the mean may be considerably skewed by \noutliers. Imputation methods were used to estimate \neffect sizes from the median, range and sample \nsize when possible. If studies reported medians and \nIQRs, the distance between the median and the \n25th percentile was assumed to be 0.67 standard \ndeviations. If medians were not available, effect \nsizes were calculated from means and standard \ndeviations.\nWhenever relevant data from three or more studies \nwere available and combining them was considered \nappropriate, the results were summarised using \nmeta-analysis. The available data were first tested \nto determine whether the results of the studies \nincluded in the meta-analysis differed from \none another by more than would be expected \nby chance (heterogeneity testing) using the I2 \nstatistic (I2 \u2265 50% indicating notable unexplained \ninconsistency). If study results did not differ in \nthis manner, the study results were pooled in a \nfixed-effects model to obtain a summary estimate. \nRandom-effects meta-analysis was performed to \nenable a qualitative conclusion if I2 \u2265 50% or if \nfewer than 80% of studies reported the outcome of \ninterest or had calculable effect sizes.\nHow were the differences \nbetween studies investigated?\nHaving obtained a summary estimate of the results, \nthe robustness of the findings was tested by means \nof sensitivity analysis. Each study was removed \nseparately to determine whether any one study \nhad a substantial influence on the meta-analytic \nfindings. The systematic addition of each study \n(cumulative meta-analysis) was also performed to \ndetermine the study\u2019s effect on the summary result. \nStudies were added in order, beginning with the \nhighest-weighted study and ending with the lowest-\nweighted study (studies were also added in reverse \norder). These sensitivity analyses were used for \u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

None of the studies compared ODM \nwith thermodilution. Although all of the studies \nexcept that by Venn and colleagues23 reported \nplacing Doppler probes in the control group \npatients during surgery. Doppler monitoring was \nnot used in the fluid maintenance protocol in \ncontrol patients.\nSix of the seven studies used the CardioQ ODM \nsystem or an earlier model of this system while \nConway and colleagues17 used the TECO system. \nThe types of surgery performed included elective \nbowel surgery,17,21,24 hip fracture repair surgery,22,23 \nelective cardiac surgery20 and elective general, \nurological or gynaecological surgery.18\nThe five studies comparing ODM plus CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment \nwith CVP monitoring plus conventional clinical \nassessment had a median quality score of 8.9 \n(range 8.1\u20139.7) on the ECRI quality scale, resulting \nin a quality rating of high for this evidence base. \nThe two studies comparing ODM plus conventional \nclinical assessment with conventional clinical \nassessment had a median quality score of 9.0 \n(range 8.9\u20139.0), also resulting in a quality rating of \nhigh. One of these studies23 also compared ODM \nplus conventional clinical assessment with CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional clinical assessment.\nODM plus CVP plus conventional \nassessment versus CVP plus \nconventional assessment\nFive studies involving 453 patients reported this \ncomparison. The types of surgery performed \nincluded elective bowel surgery,17,21,24 elective \ncardiac surgery20 and elective general, urological or \ngynaecological surgery.18\nMortality\nNo study reported any deaths during surgery. \nThree studies17,20,21 reported one death each in the \ncontrol group within 30 days following surgery, and \none study24 reported a death in the control group \nwithin 60 days following surgery, but the between-\ngroup differences were not statistically significant.\nMajor complications\nThree of five studies reported major \ncomplications,17,20,21 generally defined as life \nthreatening or requiring intensive or high-\ndependency care. All studies showed a statistically \nsignificant reduction in major complications in \nthe Doppler-monitored group. Because each study \nreported no major complications in the ODM \ngroup, the Peto method was used for calculating \nodds ratios. The Peto ORs (95% CIs) for the three \nstudies were \u22122.08 (\u22123.72 to \u22120.44),21 \u22122.19 \n(\u22124.01 to \u22120.37)17 and \u22122.19 (\u22123.86 to \u22120.51).20 \nAlthough a Peto random-effects meta-analysis \nwas undertaken, an overall pooled estimate was \nnot presented as only three of the five studies \npresented separate data on major complications. \nHowever, the 95% CI was 0.04\u20130.31, indicating \nstatistically significantly fewer major complications \nassociated with ODM.\nTotal complications\nFour of five studies reported total \ncomplications.17,18,21,24 Two of these four studies \nshowed a statistically significant difference \nindicating fewer total complications in the \nDoppler-monitored group, with OR (95% \nCI) 0.23 (0.10\u20130.54)18 and 0.41 (0.20\u20130.84),24 \nwhile the remaining two studies also showed \nfewer complications but the difference was not Appendix 2\n72\nsignificant, with OR 0.44 (0.13\u20131.54)17 and OR \n0.47 (0.20\u20131.07).21 Gan and colleagues18 reported \nthe total number of complications rather than the \nnumber of patients with complications. Although \na random-effects meta-analysis was undertaken, \nan overall pooled estimate was not presented as \nthe studies reported complications somewhat \ndifferently (patients versus events). However, the \n95% CI was \u22121.43 to \u22120.57, indicating statistically \nsignificantly fewer total complications associated \nwith ODM.\nLength of hospital stay\nAll five studies reported this outcome. Four \nstudies reported a statistically significant reduction \nin length of stay (based on either medians or \nmeans) associated with Doppler-monitored fluid \nreplacement, with a median of 6 versus 7 days, \np = 0.03,18 7 (IQR 3\u201335) versus 9 (IQR 4\u201345) days, \np = 0.005,21 10 (IQR 5.75) versus 11.5 (IQR 4.75) \ndays, p = 0.03,24 and a mean of 6.4 (range 5\u20139) \nversus 10.1 (range 5\u2013 48) days, p = 0.01.20 The \nfifth study, by Conway and colleagues,17 reported a \nmedian of 12 (range 7\u2013103) days for the Doppler \ngroup versus 11 (range 7\u201330) days for the control \ngroup (p-value not reported). In this study, one \npatient in the Doppler group remained in hospital \nfor 103 days, not because of complications but \nbecause a social\/community placement could not \nbe found. Although a random-effects meta-analysis \nwas undertaken, an overall pooled estimate was \nnot presented on the grounds that three of the five \nstudies reporting this outcome did not present data \nthat allowed a precise effect size to be calculated. \nHowever, the 95% CI was \u22122.21 to \u22120.57, \nindicating a statistically significantly shorter length \nof hospital stay associated with ODM.\nODM plus conventional \nassessment versus CVP plus \nconventional assessment\nOne study23 compared ODM plus conventional \nassessment (n = 30) with CVP monitoring plus \nconventional assessment (n = 31) [and also with \nconventional assessment alone (n = 29), see below] \nin patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture \nrepair.\nMortality\nThere were fewer deaths in the ODM group (3\/30 \nversus 6\/31, p = 0.30), although the difference was \nnot statistically significant.\nMajor complications\nVenn and colleagues23 did not report major \ncomplications separately from total complications.\nTotal complications\nThere were 46.7% (14\/30) complications in \nthe ODM plus conventional assessment group \ncompared with 51.6% (16\/31) in the CVP \nmonitoring plus conventional assessment group. \nThe difference in the rate of total complications \n(comprising mostly infections and cardiovascular \nevents) favoured the ODM group without \nbeing statistically significant (OR 0.82, 95% CI \n0.30\u20132.25). In terms of the number of patients \nexperiencing complications, 33.3% (10\/30) patients \nin the ODM group experienced complications \ncompared with 45.2% (14\/31) patients in the CVP \nmonitoring group. The difference in the number of \npatients experiencing complications also favoured \nthe ODM group, but again without reaching \nstatistical significance (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.21\u20131.72).\nLength of hospital stay\nThe difference in the mean length of hospital stay \nbetween the ODM and CVP monitoring group was \nnot statistically significant (13.5 versus 13.3 days, \nrespectively, p = 0.96).\nODM plus conventional assessment \nversus conventional assessment\nTwo studies involving 130 patients undergoing \nsurgery for hip fracture repair reported this \ncomparison.22,23\nMortality\nNo deaths occurred during surgery in either study. \nVenn and colleagues23 reported three (3\/30) deaths \nin the ODM group and two (2\/29) in the control \ngroup within 30 days following surgery, while \nSinclair and colleagues22 reported no (0\/20) deaths \nin the ODM group and one (1\/20) in the control \ngroup during this period. Sinclair and colleagues22 \nreported a further two deaths (one in the ODM \ngroup and one in the control group) after this \nperiod and within 3 months following surgery. In \nterms of total mortality rates, neither study showed \na statistically significant difference between the two \ntreatment groups.\nMajor complications\nThe study by Sinclair and colleagues22 did not \nreport complications and the study by Venn and \ncolleagues23 did not report major complications \nseparately from total complications.\nTotal complications\nOnly Venn and colleagues23 reported total \ncomplications. The ODM group experienced \nstatistically significantly fewer complications \n(46.7%, 14\/30) than the control group (79.3%, \u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n73\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta13070  Health Technology Assessment 2009; Vol. 13: No. 7\n23\/29) (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07\u20130.72). However, \nin terms of the number of patients experiencing \ncomplications the difference between the ODM \ngroup (33.3%, 10\/30) and the control group \n(55.2%, 16\/29) was not statistically significant (OR \n0.41, 95% CI 0.14\u20131.16).\nLength of hospital stay\nBoth studies reported a shorter length of stay for \nthe ODM group. Sinclair and colleagues22 reported \na statistically significantly shorter length of stay for \nthe ODM group compared with the control group, \nwith a median of 11 (range 3\u201323) days versus \n20 (range 5\u2013220) days, p < 0.05. In the study by \nVenn and colleagues,23 although the ODM group \nexperienced a shorter length of stay (mean 13.5 \ndays, 95% CI 10.9\u201317.5) compared with the control \ngroup (mean 17.5 days, 95% CI 13.9\u201324.4) the \ndifference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31). \nIn a random-effects meta-analysis the pooled \nestimate was statistically significant in favour of \npatients receiving ODM (OR \u22126.76, 95% CI \u22121.83 \nto \u22121.68).\nKey question 3 (Does therapeutic \nmanagement based on oesophageal \nDoppler ultrasound-based cardiac \noutput monitoring during hospitalisation \nlead to improved patient outcomes?)\nOne study19 addressed this question, comparing \nODM (CardioQ system) plus CVP monitoring plus \nconventional assessment with CVP monitoring plus \nconventional assessment in 174 patients admitted \nto cardiac intensive care following cardiac surgery. \nThe study achieved a quality score of 8.5 on the \nECRI quality scale, resulting in a quality rating of \nhigh.\nODM plus CVP plus conventional \nassessment versus CVP plus \nconventional assessment\nMortality\nThere were more deaths in the ODM group (4\/89 \nversus 2\/85) although the difference was not \nstatistically significant (p = 0.43).\nMajor complications\nAlthough McKendry and colleagues19 stated \nthat there was a trend towards fewer major \npostoperative complications and deaths in the \nODM group, the authors did not report major \ncomplications separately from total complications.\nTotal complications\nAlthough fewer patients in the ODM group (19.1%, \n17\/89) experienced complications compared with \nthe control group (30.6%, 26\/85), the difference \nwas not statistically significant (p = 0.08).\nLength of hospital stay\nThere was a statistically significantly shorter \nmedian length of stay in the ODM group (7 days, \nrange not reported) compared with the control \ngroup (9 days), p = 0.02. The mean length of stay \nwas also shorter in the ODM group (11.4 days) \ncompared with the control group (13.9 days), \np-value not reported.\nKey question 4 (What complications, \nharms and adverse events associated \nwith oesophageal Doppler ultrasound \nmonitoring have been reported?)\nTwenty-three studies addressed this question, \nincluding four RCTs,17,21\u201323 18 case series7,10,11,34\u201348 \nand one article containing two case reports.49 \nBecause the intention was just to generate a list \nof all reported harms of oesophageal Doppler \nultrasound probes, these studies were not assessed \nfor quality.\nNineteen studies (four RCTs and 15 case \nseries) involving 654 patients specifically stated \nthat oesophageal Doppler probes led to no \ncomplications in any of the patients included in the \nstudies.\nThree case series11,39,42 and the article containing \ntwo case reports49 reported complications, harms \nor adverse events associated with oesophageal \nDoppler probes. A case series by Iregui and \ncolleagues39 involving 106 critically ill patients \nreported accidental removal of an orogastric tube \nduring oesophageal probe removal. A study by \nMoxon and colleagues42 involving 13 patients \nreported incorrect placement of an oesophageal \nDoppler probe in one patient\u2019s trachea, although \nthis did not cause any adverse effect. A study by \nSinger and colleagues11 involving 60 patients \nreported occasional minimal trauma in the buccal \ncavity during placement of the oesophageal \nprobe but did not state the number of patients \nwho experienced this problem. Chandan and \nHull49 reported two case reports of incorrect \nplacement of an oesophageal Doppler probe \nin the left main bronchus, which led to adverse \nsymptoms (increasing airway resistance and oxygen \nrequirement) in one of the patients.\nThe authors stated that a search of the FDA\u2019s \nManufacturer and User Facility Device Experience \n(MAUDE) database identified one report of a \nmechanical problem with a CardioQ Doppler Appendix 2\n74\nprobe. While a nurse was cleaning one of these \nprobes with a tissue, the probe boot (distal end of \nthe probe) separated from the rest of the probe \nbody. However, this particular probe did not cause \nany complication in the patient.\nWas any cost information \nreported?\nNo.\nAuthors\u2019 conclusions\nKey question 1\nSeveral methods are currently used to monitor \ncardiac output in patients during surgery \nor intensive care. These methods include \nthermodilution, dye dilution, lithium dilution, \nmethods using the Fick principle, pulse contour \nmethods, thoracic electrical bioimpedance, \ntransoesophageal echocardiography, ultrasonic \ncardiac output monitoring and ODM.\nKey question 2\nThe addition of ODM for guided fluid replacement \nto a protocol using CVP monitoring and \nconventional clinical assessment during surgery \nleads to a clinically significant reduction in the \nrate of major and total complications in surgical \npatients compared with CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment alone. The \nstrength of evidence supporting this conclusion is \nstrong.\nThe addition of ODM to the protocol described \nabove also reduces the length of hospital stay for \nsurgical patients (clinical significance uncertain). \nThe strength of evidence supporting this \nconclusion is strong.\nOnly one study compared ODM plus conventional \nclinical assessment with CVP monitoring plus \nconventional clinical assessment. Because this \nwas one small study with non-informative effect \nsizes, no conclusions were possible for any of the \noutcomes of interest.\nThe addition of ODM for guided fluid replacement \nto conventional clinical assessment during surgery \nleads to a clinically significant reduction in the \nlength of hospital stay compared with conventional \nclinical assessment alone. The strength of evidence \nsupporting this conclusion is weak. Because only \na single study reported total complications, no \nconclusion was possible concerning this outcome.\nNo conclusion could be drawn concerning relative \nmortality rates for any of the comparisons in key \nquestion 2.\nThe AHRQ report stated that the conclusions \nreached for key question 2 applied only to \npatients undergoing surgical procedures with \nan expected substantial blood loss or significant \nfluid compartment redistribution requiring fluid \nreplacement.\nKey question 3\nThe evidence base contained only one small \nstudy that was insufficient to allow conclusions \nto be reached about the effectiveness of ODM in \nhospitalised patients in non-operative settings.\nKey question 4\nCurrently, no serious adverse events associated \nwith ODM have been reported in the literature \nor the MAUDE database. The only minor events \nidentified included two cases of incorrect probe \nplacement in the left main bronchus, one case \nof incorrect placement in the trachea, a tube \ndisplacement during probe removal and an \nunspecified number of cases of minimal trauma \nin the buccal cavity during probe placement. \nNineteen studies with a total of 654 patients \nspecifically stated that oesophageal Doppler probes \ndid not cause any complications. The number of \npatients represented in these studies is relatively \nsmall. However, the available evidence suggests \nthat oesophageal Doppler probes are relatively low-\nrisk devices, as reporting of even minor morbidity \nhas been infrequent thus far.\nCommentary\nThis systematic review addressed four clearly \nstated questions, three of which (key questions 2\u20134) \nwere clinically relevant, and appropriate inclusion \ncriteria were specified. The search strategy used \nto identify studies was comprehensive in terms of \nthe sources searched, although it was restricted \nto published, peer-reviewed, English language \nfull text articles, which might have resulted in the \nomission of some relevant data. Relevant details of \nthe included studies that addressed key questions \n2 and 3 were reported clearly and in full. Fewer \ndetails were given of the included studies that \naddressed key question 4, and no details were \ngiven of the studies that addressed key question \n1, but this was appropriate given the nature of \nthe evidence being sought.

Were patients assigned to groups based on factors other than patient or physician \npreference? \nYes Yes\n5.  Were the characteristics of the patients in different groups comparable? Yes Yes\n6.  Did the patients in the different study groups have similar levels of performance on \noutcomes at baseline?\nYes Yes\n7.  Was the study prospectively planned? Yes Yes\n8.  Did 85% or more of the patients complete the study? Yes Yes\n9.  Was there a less than 16% difference in completion rates between the study\u2019s groups?  Yes Yes\n10.  Were all of the study\u2019s groups concurrently treated? Yes Yes\n11.  Was compliance with treatment greater than or equal to 85% in both of the study\u2019s \ngroups? \nYes Yes\n12.  Were all of the study\u2019s groups treated at the same centres? Yes Yes\n13.  Were subjects blinded to treatment? No Yes\n14.  Did the authors test and confirm that blinding of patients was maintained? No NR\n15.  Was the treating physician blinded to group assignment? No Yes\n16.  Were the outcome assessors blinded to group assignment? No Yes\n17.  Was there concealment of allocation? NR NR\n18.  Was the outcome of interest objective and was it objectively measured?  Yes Yes\n19.  Were the same methods used to measure outcomes in all of the study\u2019s groups? Yes Yes\n20.  Was the instrument used to measure the outcome standard? Yes Yes\n21.  Was the same treatment given to all of the patients enrolled in the experimental group? Yes Yes\n22.  Was the same treatment given to all of the patients enrolled in the control group? Yes Yes\n23.  Were the follow-up times in all of the study\u2019s relevant groups approximately equal? Yes Yes\n24.  Was the funding for this study derived from a source that does not have a financial \ninterest in its results?\nNR NR\n25.  Were the authors\u2019 conclusions supported by the data in the results section? Yes Yes\nQuality score 7.4 8.8\nQuality rating Moderate High\nNR, not reported.\nECRI uses these 25 items to compute a summary score ranging from 0 to 10, where 10 indicates an ideal study and 0 \nindicates a study of the poorest quality. Individual item answers were converted to numeric scores by counting 1 for each \n\u2018Yes\u2019 answer, \u22121 for each \u2018No\u2019 answer and \u22120.5 for each \u2018NR\u2019 answer. The numeric scores for all 25 items were then added \nand 25 was added to the total; this number was then divided by 50 and multiplied by 10. These calculations yielded the 0\u201310 \nsummary scale. Studies that scored < 5 were considered to be of unacceptable quality, those scoring > 5 but \u2264\u20096.7 were \nconsidered to be of low quality, those that scored > 6.7 but \u2264\u20098.4 were considered to be of moderate quality and those \nscoring \u2265 8.5 were considered to be of high quality.\nAppendix 4 \nECRI quality assessment scale applied to the \ntwo additional studies\u00a9 2009 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.
