INTRODUCTION\nThe use of nucleon knockout reaction partial cross sec-\ntions, and their associated residue momentum distributions,\nfor the single particle spectroscopy of light exotic nuclei\nhas been the subject of recent studies and reviews [1\u20134].\nSeveral direct reaction models have also been developed to\nanalyze and interpret different aspects of these experimental\ndata. Among these is the transfer-to-the-continuum (TC)\ndirect reaction model, as developed by Bonaccorso and\nBrink [5].\nThe potential to exploit spin degrees of freedom and\npolarization observables could significantly enhance and\nsupplement this spectroscopic role, as well as elucidating\nstudies of the reaction dynamics and the reaction mechanism.\nIn particular, the angular distributions of the \u03b3 -rays emitted\nby the heavy residue following the nucleon removal process\nare becoming amenable to experimental study [6]. We also\nrequire a better knowledge of the secondary beam polarizations\nexpected from the fragmentation process itself [7\u20139]. When\ndiscussing such polarization phenomena, the possible role\nof spin-dependent distortions from the interactions between\nthe projectile\u2019s constituents and the target must also be\nconsidered. This spin-dependence (the spin-orbit force) in\nthe nucleon-target interaction can be readily included within\nthe TC approach adopted here. This is not the case in the\nmuch-used eikonal approaches (see, for example Ref. [10] for\nthe deuteron case) where a first step is the use of an adiabatic\nor sudden approximation [11] for the internal motion of the\nprojectile.\nIn this work we therefore generalize the TC model for the\nstudy of polarization and nucleon-target spin-orbit distortion\neffects in single nucleon knockout reactions. Spin-orbit in-\nteraction effects have been included previously, both in the\n\u2217Electronic address: camacho@df.unipi.it; Present address: Insti-\ntuto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Pisa, I-56125 Pisa,\nItaly.\nsemiclassical formulation of transfer reactions between bound\nstates of heavy ions [12,13], where they affect selectivity\nwith respect to the bound state angular momentum quantum\nnumbers, and, as a natural extension, to the TC model of\nnuclear breakup reactions [14,20,23] as a spin-orbit distortion.\nIn the former case [13], this distortion was essential in the\nreproduction of the position of the target single particle\nresonances, whereas in the latter [20,23] spin-orbit effects\nwere shown to be important to determine the spin value of\nthe single particle state from which breakup originates. How-\never, these were always studied in conjunction with further\napproximations to the TC reaction amplitude. Here, these\nnucleon-target spin-orbit distortion effects are studied with\nand without such additional approximations [15]. Regarding\nstudies of analyzing powers, in Ref. [16] the TC formalism\nwas applied in calculations of transfer reactions between\nheavy nuclei. One of our aims is to assess this approach in\napplications to one-nucleon knockout from lighter and also\nmore weakly-bound nuclei.\nIn Sec. II the main formalism is developed and the basis\nof the TC model is discussed. The formalism for analyzing\npowers is also presented. In Sec. III the reactions under study\nand the two-body interactions that we use are described.\nCalculations of polarized momentum distributions, analyzing\npowers and \u03b3 -ray angular distributions are then presented.\nSection IV discusses our choice of the nucleon-target spin-\norbit interaction. Finally, in Sec. V, the spin-orbit distortion\neffects are included and their importance for the calculated\nobservables is discussed.\nII. FORMALISM\nThe transfer-to-the-continuum (TC) model has evolved\nfrom theories of the (one-step) transfer of a nucleon (or\ncluster of nucleons) between bound states in heavy nuclei.\nThe essential step in these earlier bound states formulations\ninvolved making a semiclassical approximation to the entrance\nand exit channel distorted waves in the distorted-waves\n0556-2813\/2005\/72(4)\/044603(10)\/$23.00 044603-1 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society\nA.

These bound state models were then gener-\nalized and applied to treat, approximately, nucleon\/cluster\ntransfers to both resonant and nonresonant final states in\nthe continuum\u2014thus the projectile breakup is viewed as a\nparticle transfer into continuum final states of the nucleon and\ntarget system [5,20]. It is therefore assumed that the nucleon-\ntarget interaction is the dominant interaction in the final\nstate.\nThe TC formulation also assumes that the nucleon-core po-\ntential, that initially binds the projectile, and the nucleon-target\npotential, responsible for the breakup of the projectile, have\nno spatial overlap during the entire collision. The TC model\nis therefore most applicable to weakly bound systems and to\nneutron knockout or transfer processes. This nonoverlapping\npotential approximation allows the use of external forms for\nboth the nucleon-core and the nucleon-target wave functions\n[20]. Additionally, in the TC model, the core-target motion is\ntreated semiclassically while the neutron-target interaction is\ntreated quantum mechanically [5,17,20]. Here, we adopt the\nnotation developed in Ref. [15].\nA. Cross section\nThe projectile initial state wave function is described as\na bound state of a neutron and a core c.

Spin observables\nIn order to calculate analyzing powers for knockout, we\nmust construct the associated reaction spin-efficiency matrix\nRn1n\u20321 , defined by\nRn1n\u20321 = k2f\n\u222b\ndk\u0302f dK\u0302\n\u2211\n\u03c3\nT (j1n1, \u03c3 kf K ) [T (j1n\u20321, \u03c3 kf K )]\u2217.\n(7)\nHere the probability amplitude T is given by Eq. (1) and\ndk\u0302f denotes integration over only the directions of kf . This\nexpression is valid in an experiment where no measurements\nare made of the directions of the core or neutron final state\nmomenta. When analyzing powers for the integrated cross\nsection are discussed in Sec. III C, then the magnitude of kf is\nalso integrated over in Eq. (7).\nKnowledge of this efficiency matrix allows predictions to\nbe made for a knockout experiment with an incident projectile\nbeam in an arbitrary spin state, involving both diagonal and\noff-diagonal density matrix elements, provided that the spin\nprojection \u03c3 of the knocked out neutron is not observed.

There\nthe Bessel function Km1\u2212m2 (\u03b7b) in Eq. (3) was replaced by\nthe first term of its asymptotic expansion for large \u03b7b. An\nadditional aim of this paper is to assess the accuracy of such\nan expansion to lowest order and also to higher orders, in the\ncase of breakup studies of light nuclei.\nIII. RESULTS FOR SPIN OBSERVABLES\nTwo reactions are used to illustrate this work. The first is\n9Be(34Si,33Si)X at a beam energy of 70 MeV per nucleon.\nThis has been the subject of experiments carried out at\nthe National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL)\nat Michigan State University (MSU) [23] and has a neu-\ntron separation energy of 7.36 MeV. The second reaction,\n9Be (17C, 16C)X at 60 MeV per nucleon, has a ground state\n044603-3\nA. GARC\u00b4IA-CAMACHO, R. C. JOHNSON, AND J. A. TOSTEVIN PHYSICAL REVIEW C 72, 044603 (2005)\nneutron separation energy of only 0.73 MeV. This knockout\nexperiment has also been performed at the NSCL, but at a\nslightly different beam energy of 62 MeV per nucleon [24].\nWe have chosen to calculate observables at 60 MeV, and to\nuse the same two-body interaction descriptions as in Ref. [25],\nto compare our theoretical analyzing power results with those\npresented there. The ground state to ground state transitions in\nboth cases are assumed to result from a 0d3\/2 neutron removal.\nWith this j1 = 3\/2 projectile spin we expect a nonvanishing\nT20 analyzing power [21].\nA. Model two-body interactions\nWe use models for the neutron-target optical potential\nand core-target (ion-ion) interaction which are appropriate\nfor intermediate-energy projectile beams. Following closely\nthe procedures used in Ref. [15], the neutron-target optical\npotential is constructed by folding the 9Be target point-nucleon\nmatter density with the nuclear-matter effective nucleon-\nnucleon (NN ) interaction of Jeukenne, Lejeune, and Mahaux\n(JLM) [26] and using the local density approximation. We\nassume a harmonic oscillator form for the 9Be nucleon\ndensity. This microscopic approach to the complex nucleon\noptical potential provides very good agreement with measured\nreaction cross sections, and also elastic scattering angular\ndistributions from light nuclear targets, over a range of incident\nnucleon energies, e.g., Ref. [27]. These include the incident\nenergies of importance here. The JLM effective interaction\nparametrization itself extends over the entire energy range\nfor which the neutron-target two-body S-matrix is required,\nthus our approach provides a consistent description of the\nnucleon-target interaction over the entire phase space probed\nby the TC reaction amplitude.\nSince the TC model also assumes peripherality of the\nreaction, and that we are fully-external in the wave functions\nof the removed nucleon in the initial and final states, the core-\ntarget interaction (absorption) enters only through Pel(b). This\nelastic channel survival probability for the core is instrumental\nin determining the active regions of impact parameter overlap\nof these wave functions and hence the resulting removal cross\nsections. We thus take proper account of the geometrical sizes\nof the core and target, and their associated strong absorp-\ntion radius, by constructing the core-target interaction and\nS-matrices using the double-folding of their matter densities\nwith an effective nucleon-nucleon (NN ) interaction. Details\nare given in Ref. [15].\nThe 16C and 33Si-core point nucleon densities were assumed\nto have Gaussian form factors with range parameters chosen\nto reproduce the empirically deduced root mean squared (rms)\nmatter radii. These were taken to be 2.70 and 3.16 fm, for 16C\nand 33Si, respectively [28]. Extensive calculations for one-\nnucleon knockout, including those for nucleon removal from\ntightly-bound states, show that the detailed radial form of these\ndensities is unimportant for the calculated cross sections, see,\ne.g., Ref. [29]. The resulting Pel(b) has essentially a black-disk\nabsorption profile and the cross sections are determined by the\ncore and target matter rms radii, which then determine their\nstrong absorption radius.\n11.8 12 12.2 12.4\np|| (GeV\/c)\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nT20\n0\n1\n2\nExact\n(b)\n5.2 5.4\np|| (GeV\/c)\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nT20\n0\n1\n2\nExact\n(a)\nFIG. 1.

Analyzing power momentum distributions\nCalculations of T20 as a function of the core parallel\nmomentum in the laboratory, p||, are shown in Fig. 1. These\ncalculations result from (i) the exact evaluation of the Bessel\nfunction in Eq.

The analyzing powers have a positive peak\nin the region of the maximum in the calculated cross section.\nThis peak is positioned at the value of core parallel momentum\ncorresponding to k1 \u2248 0. TheT20 decrease with increasing |k1|,\nbecoming negative. To understand this behavior, the polarized\ncross section momentum distributions must be examined. T20\ndetermines the fraction of the total cross section arising from\neach projectile angular momentum substate.

For both of our model systems we note that there\nis a large difference between \u03c33\/2 and \u03c31\/2 in the exact and\nin all orders of approximation of the Bessel function. The\ncontribution from the more-aligned n1 = 3\/2 configuration\nis significantly bigger. The \u03c31\/2 are small at k1 = 0 as they\ncorrespond to a situation where, classically, the neutron orbit\nis in a plane that contains the beam direction. This is sketched\nin Fig. 3. In this spin projection the wave function will contain\nonly small components with k1 \u2248 0. For n1 = 3\/2 on the other\nhand the angular momentum is aligned more nearly parallel to\nthe beam direction, the neutron orbits in a perpendicular plane,\nand thus contributes more significantly to the cross section\nfor small k1. The situation is most clear when neglecting the\nneutron spin. In this limit the m1 = 0 cross section vanishes\nidentically at k1 = 0, as has been shown in Ref. [31] within\nGlauber theory.\nFor each of our chosen systems, Fig. 2 also shows the\nconvergence of the polarized cross section with different\norders in the asymptotic expansion of the Bessel function.\nTheir agreement is good for \u03c31\/2. For \u03c33\/2 however both\nthe convergence and the agreement is very poor. It is clear\nthat these approximations affect, almost exclusively, the most\nhighly aligned configurations.

We conclude that for the breakup of light nuclei,\nan exact treatment of the TC amplitude is crucial to obtaining\nreliable theoretical predictions for analyzing powers.\nC. Polarized total cross sections\nWe now discuss the effect of beam polarization on the\nintegrated breakup cross section. Relevant experiments are\nnow those in which the final momenta of the fragments are not\nmeasured, and so are summed over. As was stated in Sec. II B,\nthe Rn1n\u20321 must now be integrated over all variables except the\nn1 labels. This inclusive analyzing power is denoted here by\nT i20. T\ni\n20 is not the area under the curves in Fig. 1, but results\nfrom integrating separately the numerator and denominator of\nT20. Table I presents the exact results obtained for 17C and\n34Si and those from different orders of the Bessel function\nexpansion.\nWe note that T i20 can reach a significant fraction of its\nmaximum allowed value which, for j1 = 3\/2, is unity. T20\nis a measure of the sensitivity of the cross section to the\nbeam polarization. Therefore, if there was significant (tensor)\npolarization of the secondary beam being used as the incident\nbeam in the knockout reaction, significant differences in the\ntheoretical predictions for integrated cross sections and of\ndeduced spectroscopic factors might result. The sign of T i20\nwas also discussed in Ref. [25] with the use of geometrical\narguments.\nThe different approximate predictions for T i20 are worse\nthan was the case for the unpolarized cross section, as seen in\nthe unpolarized momentum distributions of Ref. [15].\nA calculation of the T i20 arising from the inelastic breakup\nor stripping mechanism was calculated using eikonal theory\nfor the 17C reaction [25]. This gave T20 = 0.23. The stripping\ncontribution from the TC model, the first term only in\nEq. (6), gives 0.35. This suggests that the matching conditions\ninherent in the TC model predict a greater alignment effect.\nExperimental information is required to study and assess this\neffect quantitatively.\nD. Populations of the core substates\nIn general the core nucleus has a nonzero intrinsic angular\nmomentum Ic and following the reaction some orientations of\nIc will be favored. This can be predicted from the results of\nprevious sections, where it was shown that the most highly\naligned total angular momenta make the largest contributions\nto the cross section. Thus, with \u03bec being the projection of\nIc on the z-axis, cross sections for large |\u03bec| are expected to\ndominate. According to Eq.

There is\na large difference between the contributions from |\u03bec| = 1\/2\nand |\u03bec| = 3\/2, and a better agreement between the different\napproximate TC amplitudes for |\u03bec| = 1\/2.\nE. \u03b3 -ray angular distributions\nThe 33Si residual nucleus, with an assumed Ic = 3\/2+\nground state, is known to have excited states at 1.01 MeV and\nat 4.32 MeV [32]. We have assumed that the stripped neutron\noriginates from the d3\/2 valence shell of 34Si. Neutron removal\nfrom the d5\/2 shell is now considered, leaving the 33Si nucleus\nin an excited Ic = 5\/2+ state, with decay to the ground state by\n\u03b3 -emission. The angular distribution of \u03b3 radiation from this\nexcited state decay is known to depend on the orientation of the\nangular momentum of the emitting object [33]. In the nuclear\nreactions under study here this information is provided by the\npopulations of the different spin substates \u03bec, calculated in\nSec. III D. Figure 5 shows the 33Si (5\/2+, 4.32 MeV) excited\nstate substate populations [23]. These calculations use the\nexact Bessel function approach.\nAs expected, the most important populations are of the\nmost aligned states. These populations are now used as input\nto the calculation of the \u03b3 -ray angular distributions [34,35].\nThe probability of emission of photons with wave vector k, of\n044603-6\nPOLARIZATION OBSERVABLES AND SPIN-DEPENDENT . . .

Spin-orbit distortions\nhave been included previously within the TC model, but using\nthe zeroth order term of the asymptotic expansion of the\nBessel function [14], or under the M-function approach [19],\nin Ref. [20]. Here we calculate Eq. (4) that incorporates\nboth the final-state spin-orbit distortions and the exact Bessel\nfunction.\nA.

Effects of nucleon-target spin-orbit distortion on the\nresidue momentum distribution for the 17C projectile. The calculation\nwith (without) a spin-orbit interaction corresponds to the long-dashed\n(full) line. Stars (triangles) correspond to stripping with (without)\nspin-orbit, whereas circles (squares) represent elastic breakup with\n(without) spin-orbit.\nthe parallel momentum distribution of the 16C and 33Si ground\nstate residues, respectively, calculated in the exact Bessel\nfunction approach. These are compared to the previous results\nof Eq. (5). The differences between the results of Eqs. (4)\nand (5) turns out to be small and within the experimental\nerror bars on available integrated cross section measurements.\nThe difference reaches its maximum at beam velocity and is\nsizable for negative k1, corresponding to low neutron-target\nenergies. The effects become smaller as the neutron-target\nrelative energy is increased, due to the reduction in the\nstrength of the spin-orbit interaction with incident energy,\nEqs. (22).\nFigure 9 displays the effect of spin-orbit distortion on\nthe individual stripping and elastic breakup contributions to\nthe momentum distribution of the 16C residue. It is clear\nthat the spin-orbit force induced differences are due to the\nelastic breakup rather than the stripping mechanism. This\ninsensitivity in the stripping component is to be expected since\nthe spin-orbit interaction is predominantly real, whereas the\nstripping cross section is dictated by the imaginary part of\nthe nucleon-target phase shift, see, e.g., Ref. [20]. Since, at\nthese energies, the knockout is dominated by the stripping\nmechanism, the spin-orbit distortion effects on the inclu-\nsive cross section and momentum distribution are therefore\nsuppressed.\nB. Analyzing powers\nAs was done in the previous section, for the cross sec-\ntion, we now investigate the effect of spin-orbit distortion\non calculations of analyzing powers. This means we use\nEq. (10) rather than Eq. (14).

Calculated T20 versus the 33Si residue parallel momen-\ntum, with and without neutron-target spin-orbit distortions, for a 34Si\nprojectile.\nThe similarity is quite remarkable and will induce a minimal\neffect on the polarized cross sections. Throughout this work\neverything points in the direction of the tensor analyzing power\nbeing an observable whose calculation can be carried out with\na good degree of accuracy, without significant sensitivity to the\ndifferent ingredients within the reaction model. In particular,\nthe choices of the radius governing the core-target interaction\nand the neutron-target optical potential are of little importance.\nTo add one more point to this argument, the inclusive analyzing\npower T i20 has been calculated when including the spin-orbit\ndistortion. These results are also shown in Table I. They are\nalso very similar.\nVI. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nSpin observables of one-nucleon knockout reactions, and\nthe effects of the neutron-target spin-orbit interaction, have\nbeen considered using the transfer-to-the-continuum direct\nreaction formalism. The theoretical framework for the calcula-\ntion of analyzing powers is presented, and some test cases are\nstudied. Our results show that the reaction analyzing powers\ncan be large and may reach a significant fraction of their max-\nimum allowed values. We show that the calculated analyzing\npowers are very sensitive to the use of approximations to the\nTC model amplitude and hence that a proper (exact) treatment\nof this transfer amplitude is required for accurate calculations\nof analyzing powers.\nThe spin-dependent formalism developed also enables\npredictions of the angular distributions of \u03b3 -rays emitted from\nexcited states of the heavy reaction residues. The potential\nof such measurements as an additional source of structure\ninformation have been discussed in the literature [6,34]. We\nfind significant, final-state-dependent, angular dependence in\nthese calculated angular distributions and which are sensitive\nto the momentum acceptance of the recoiling residues.\nFinally, we have assessed the effects of neutron-target\nspin-orbit distortion on both the unpolarized knockout\n044603-9\nA.

The model interaction chosen\nwas consistent with measurements of the analyzing power\nin the n+9Be binary system. We find that the effects of\nthe nucleon-target spin-orbit distortions are small, suggesting\nthat, for the systems, energies, and polarization observables\nconsidered here, the formal and numerical complications of\nthis spin-dependence can safely be neglected in such knockout\ncalculations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by the United Kingdom Engineer-\ning and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under\nGrant No. GR\/M82141.\n[1] P.
