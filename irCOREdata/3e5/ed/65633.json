This article draws upon recent developments within this debate, most notably\nKasza\u2019s assertions about the \u2018illusory nature\u2019 of welfare regimes, to highlight the health\ncare discrepancy. It argues that health care provision has been a notable omission from\nthe wider regimes literature and one which, if included in the form of a health care\ndecommodification typology, can give credence to Kasza\u2019s perspective by highlighting\nthe diverse internal arrangements of welfare states and welfare state regimes.\nHow we classify welfare state regimes is a central issue in the comparative social policy\nliterature as the on-going debate about Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018Three Worlds of Welfare\u2019\nregimes shows (Esping-Andersen, 1990, 1999; Lewis, 1992; Leibfreid, 1992; Castles and\nMitchell, 1993; Orloff, 1993; Borchost, 1994; Daly, 1994; Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994;\nFerrera, 1996; Shalev, 1996; Pierson, 1998; Goodin et al., 1999; Sainsbury, 1999a, 1999b;\nPitruzzello, 1999; Arts and Gelissen, 2002; Kasza, 2002). However, what is remarkable\nabout this debate is that, whilst there have been numerous critiques in the past about\nhis range (Leibfreid, 1992; Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996), his methodology\n(Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Shalev, 1996; Pitruzzello, 1999), and the absence of gender\nin his typology (Lewis, 1992; Orloff, 1993; Borchost, 1994; Daly, 1994; Sainsbury, 1999a,\n1999b), a core procedure has only recently attracted direct attention: this is Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s decision to organise the principle of classification around the study of income\nmaintenance programs and to create regimes that generalise about all forms of social\npolicy provision from this base (Kasza, 2002).\nKasza (2002: 283) argues that \u2018the concept of welfare regimes is not a workable\nbasis for research\u2019 as it incorporates two flawed assumptions: firstly, that most of the\nkey social policy areas, such as income maintenance, education, health or housing,\nwithin a welfare regime will reflect a similar, across the board approach to welfare\nprovision, particularly in respect of the role of the state; and, secondly, that each regime\ntype itself reflects \u2018a set of principles or values that establishes a coherence in each\ncountry\u2019s welfare package\u2019 (Kasza, 2002: 272). Kasza asserts that instead of an internal\npolicy homogeneity or cohesion, welfare states and welfare regimes exhibit significant\nvariation across different areas of social provision. He asserts that the incremental,\npiecemeal and cumulative nature of welfare policy making; the diverse histories of\ndifferent policy areas within a country\u2019s welfare framework; the variation of policy actors\nacross different fields; differences in the policy making process; and the influence on\npolicy of external\/foreign welfare models; all undermine the likelihood of cohesion and\n31\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 17 Jun 2009 IP address: 129.234.4.76\nClare Bambra\ncoherence within a welfare state or, indeed, within a welfare state regime. The regime\nconcept therefore \u2018does not capture the complex motives that inform each country\u2019s\nwelfare programs\u2019 and, in pursuit of consistency, it ignores the fact that different areas of\nwelfare state provision exhibit different cross-national variations (Kasza, 2002: 283). Kasza\nconcludes that, in light of the internal diversity of welfare states, the best approach for\nfuture comparative research would be to abandon the concept of welfare state regimes and\ninstead re-focus on individual policy comparisons and the development of policy-specific\ntypologies.\nThis article takes up some aspects of Kasza\u2019s critique by examining the cross-national\nvariation in provision of what is by far one of the largest areas of social welfare \u2013 health\ncare \u2013 accounting as it does for an average of 6.6 per cent of GDP in the EU member\nstates (Eurostat, 2001). Health care, although it has been subject to separate comparative\nanalysis, has been a significant and notable omission from the broader welfare state\nliterature and particularly the regimes debate (Ham, 1997; Moran, 1999, 2000; Freeman\nand Moran, 2000; Freeman, 2000). Some commentators have drawn passing attention\nto it as a strong example of internal policy inconsistency. For example, Ginsburg (1992:\n28) highlights the fact that there is a significant difference between the UK and the\nbroader characteristics associated with the \u2018liberal\u2019 welfare state concerning the provision\nof health care; if the labour market principles of the ideal type liberal regime were\nextended into health care, it would be expected that funding would come largely from\nthe market; however, in the UK, the NHS is funded almost entirely by general taxation.\nThese comments have not been developed any further, however they are significant:\nwhich other country classifications would become problematic if health care provision\nwas included? What does this mean for the concept of \u2018welfare state regimes\u2019 and Kasza\u2019s\ncritique of it?\nThis article attempts to answer these questions through the construction of a health\ncare decommodification index that it compares and contrasts with Esping-Andersen\u2019s The\nThree Worlds of Welfare regimes typology to highlight both the internal inconsistencies in\nwelfare state provision (Kasza, 2002) and the variance in welfare state regime composition\nacross different areas of social provision.\nDecommod ifica t ion\nIn The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism (1990), Esping-Andersen argues that \u2018existing\ntheoretical models of the welfare state are inadequate\u2019 (1990: 2) as their analysis relies\ntoo heavily upon the misleading comparison of aggregate welfare state expenditure. The\nfocus on total expenditure figures conceals the variety of state approaches to welfare;\nas \u2018even if the lion\u2019s share of expenditure or personnel serves welfare aims, the kind\nof welfare provided will be qualitatively different, as will its prioritisation relative to\ncompeting activities\u2019 (1990: 1). He asserts that it is therefore more beneficial to focus\nupon what a welfare state does, rather than on how much money it is afforded. On this\nbasis, Esping-Andersen (1990: 52) presents a three-fold typology of welfare state regimes\nbased largely on the principle of labour market decommodification: liberal (UK, USA,\nIreland, Canada, Australia); conservative (Germany, France, Austria, Benelux countries\nand Italy); and social democratic (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden).\nIt is important to acknowledge the importance of going beyond aggregate measures of\nwelfare, and so, in constructing a health care typology, the concept of decommodification,\n32\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 17 Jun 2009 IP address: 129.234.4.76\nWorlds of Welfare and the Health Care Discrepancy\nas pioneered in comparative welfare research by Esping-Andersen, has been kept.\nDecommodification refers to \u2018the extent to which individuals and families can maintain a\nnormal and socially acceptable standard of living regardless of their market performance\u2019\n(Esping-Andersen, 1987: 86). The welfare state decommodified labour because certain\nservices and a certain standard of living became a right of citizenship. However,\nas O\u2019Connor notes, whilst the pure commodification of labour is possible, its pure\ndecommodification is not (O\u2019Connor, 1996: 61). The issue under discussion below is\ntherefore the relative degree of protection from dependence on the labour market that is\nprovided by different welfare states.\nThis concept of decommodification can be extended to cover health care provision.\nHealth decommodification would thereby refer to the extent to which an individual\u2019s\naccess to health care is dependent upon their market position and the extent to which\na country\u2019s provision of health is independent from the market. In this context, health\ndecommodification is not used, at least in explicit terms, as a means of analysing the\nextent to which an individual\u2019s actual health status is determined by their market position.\nIn extending the concept of decommodification to cover health care, and by producing\nan initial index based around it, it is expected that the resulting typology will be used as\na means of supplementing, critiquing or informing other welfare state typologies as it has\nbeen developed on complimentary rather than separate grounds.\nHea l th care index\nThis health care index is one way in which the concept of health care decommodification\ncould be operationalised and used in coordination with other welfare state typologies,\nmost notably that of Esping-Andersen. It is constructed in the same way as Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s labour market indexes, even though this methodology has certain drawbacks,\nsuch as the use of averaging, and has met with some criticism within the literature (Castles\nand Mitchell, 1993; Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Shalev, 1996; Pitruzello, 1999). The index\nhas to replicate Esping-Andersen\u2019s method to ensure compatibility.\nCoun t r i e s\nThe health care index includes 18 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,\nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and USA.\nData and s ou rces\nThe data upon which the health care decommodification index is based focuss on\nthe public\/private mix of health provision, the ease of access to public provision,\nand the coverage provided by the health system. The majority of data used in the\nhealth care decommodification index are taken from the OECD\u2019s international survey,\n\u2018Health data 1998: A Comparative Analysis of 29 Countries\u2019 (OECD, 2000). This is\nsupplemented where necessary with data from the WHO \u2018Health for All\u2019 database (WHO,\n2002).\n33\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 17 Jun 2009 IP address: 129.234.4.76\nClare Bambra\nCompa rab i l i t y\nA number of measures have been taken to enhance comparability between the health\ncare decommodification index and the labour market ones utilised in Esping-Andersen\u2019s\ntypology. Firstly, whilst the OECD now contains 29 countries, the health care index\nonly includes the original 18 OECD countries that were used by Esping-Andersen\nin his calculations. Secondly, the data used have been of an international nature in\norder to minimise cross-national differences in measurement, definition and collection.\nThirdly, Esping-Andersen\u2019s indexes were based upon data from 1980 and the health\ndecommodification index therefore has to use data from the same year in order to maintain\ncomparability and compatibility. Finally, Esping-Andersen\u2019s method of index construction\nhas been copied.\nM e a s u r e s\nThe health decommodification index has been constructed through the assessment of\nthree measures:\n1. Private health expenditure as a percentage of GDP \u2013 this factor refers to the extent of\nprivate financing by identifying the extent of a country\u2019s total income that is spent on\nprivate health care.\n2. Private hospital beds as a percentage of total bed stock \u2013 this factor is used to express\nthe extent of private provision at a practical level within a health care system.\n3. The percentage of the population covered by the health care system \u2013 this shows the\nextent of general access provided by the public health care system.\nThese factors have been selected because they assess the financing, provision and\ncoverage of the private sector and are, therefore, useful indicators of the varied role of the\nmarket in a health care system: The larger the size of the private health sector, in terms of\nexpenditure and consumption, the larger the role of the market and, therefore, the lower\nthe degree of health decommodification.\nMethod\nThe process of scoring in the health decommodification index replicates that used by\nEsping-Andersen (1990: 50\u201354) in respect to labour market data, and is by way of the\nnumerical description of the relationship of an individual country\u2019s score to the mean\n(and standard deviation) for two (1 and 2) of the three factors that make up the index. On\nthe basis of the values on each of these two indicators for the 18 nations, a score of 1\nfor low decommodification; 2 for medium; and 3 for high decommodification was given.\nFollowing Esping-Andersen, the classification into three scores has been done on the basis\nof one standard deviation from the mean with adjustment where necessary for extreme\noutliers (1990: 54). Finally, this score has been weighted by factor 3 \u2013 the per cent of\nthe population covered by the health care system on the basis of 100 per cent coverage\nproviding a weighting of 10, 92 per cent coverage a weighting of 9.2 and so on. Coverage\nis used as a weight because, as with Esping-Andersen\u2019s similar use of coverage\/take-up\nrate in the labour decommodification index (1990: 54), it is the most important issue for\npublic health care systems. A health care system that has a high proportion of public\n34\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 17 Jun 2009 IP address: 129.234.4.76\nWorlds of Welfare and the Health Care Discrepancy\nTable 1 Health care\ndecommodification index\nAustralia 20\nAustria 30\nBelgium 40\nCanada 50\nDenmark 50\nFinland 50\nFrance 40\nGermany 27\nIreland 40\nItaly 40\nJapan 30\nNetherlands 30\nNew Zealand 50\nNorway 50\nSweden 50\nSwitzerland 29\nUK 60\nUSA 8\nMean 39\nfunding and provision but that only provides service access to a small proportion of the\npopulation cannot be regarded as highly decommodifying.\nR e s u l t s\nThe assessment and combination of these factors (see appendix for details of individual\nfactor data) produces a health care decommodification index (see Table 1).\nThis index shows a wide range of scores, from the USA\u2019s outlier score of 8 to\nthe highest score of 60 awarded to the UK. The majority of countries fall between a\nsmaller range of 30 (Austria, Japan, Netherlands) and 50 (Canada, Denmark, Finland,\nNew Zealand, Norway and Sweden). The scores of some countries are surprisingly high,\nmost notably the \u2018liberal\u2019 countries of Canada, New Zealand and the UK, which all\nhave above average scores. In order to make a more informed comparison between the\nresults of the health care index and Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology, the mean plus\/minus\nStandard Deviation, method used to construct the index can be continued in order to\nplace the countries into one of three groups. This process produces a comparable health\ncare typology (see Table 2).\nDiscuss ion\nThese results show both a number of differences and a number of similarities within the\nclassification of countries between the health care index and that of more conventional,\nlabour market centred welfare state typologies (Titmus, 1974; Therborn, 1987; Esping-\nAndersen, 1990; Leibfreid, 1992; Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997;\nKorpi and Palme, 1998). In specific relation to Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019\nthe health care typology is in some ways complimentary, as a broad similarity exists\n35\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 17 Jun 2009 IP address: 129.234.4.76\nClare Bambra\nTable 2 Health care decommodification typology\nGroup 1 Group 2 Group 3\nAustralia Austria Canada\nUS Belgium Denmark\nFrance Finland\nGermany New Zealand\nIreland Norway\nItaly Sweden\nJapan UK\nNetherlands\nSwitzerland\nTable 3 Worlds of welfare and health care\nWorlds of welfare Health care\nLiberal Group 1\nAustralia Australia\nCanada USA\nIreland\nNew Zealand\nUK\nUSA\nConservative Group 2\nAustria Austria\nBelgium Belgium\nFrance France\nGermany Germany\nItaly Ireland\nJapan Italy\nNetherlands Japan\nSwitzerland Netherlands\nSwitzerland\nSocial Democratic Group 3\nDenmark Canada\nFinland Denmark\nNorway Finland\nSweden New Zealand\nNorway\nSweden\nUK\nover the classification of a number of countries (see Table 3).

However, the health care index can also be used to\ncritically engage with Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology, as there are also significant differences.\n36\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 17 Jun 2009 IP address: 129.234.4.76\nWorlds of Welfare and the Health Care Discrepancy\nThe health care group classification of four countries, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand,\nand UK, differs remarkably from that within the wider \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 typology\n(see Table 3).\nIn Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology, Canada, New Zealand and the UK are all placed\nwithin the low decommodifying liberal regime, however the health care typology places\nthem firmly within the higher scoring group 3 alongside countries that are considered\nas the more usual suspects, such as Sweden and Norway. Ireland is also placed within\na different group in the health care typology as it is in the medium health care group,\nwhereas it is placed in the low labour market group.\nThese mixed results both confirm and undermine welfare regime theory as on the\none hand the majority of countries have health decommodification scores and group\npositions that broadly correspond with their labour market regime ones, but on the other\nhand, there is a notable shift in the position of a number of the liberal regime countries.\nCanada, New Zealand and the UK are found in the low scoring labour market group\nand, conversely, they are also located in the high scoring health care group. These results\nlend support to a number of different explanations: Firstly, the extreme shift in location of\nCanada, New Zealand and the UK gives credence to the claims of other welfare regime\ntypologists, most notably Castles and Mitchell (1993), about the existence of a fourth \u2013\nradical \u2013 world of welfare that includes Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Secondly, the\nresults also support the tenant of welfare regime theory \u2013 the existence of a distinctive\nScandinavian welfare regime that provides consistently high decommodification across\ndifferent areas of welfare provision. Conversely though, the results also enhance Kasza\u2019s\ncritique of the actual concept of welfare state regimes, as the positioning of these three\ncountries is so varied when a different policy area is considered, that talk of \u2018regimes\u2019\nseems to be more out of convenience than empirical reality (Kasza, 2002: 284). Fourthly,\nthe results are open to accusations that health care provision is \u2018just different\u2019 from the\nrest of the welfare state package in these \u2018hybrid\u2019 countries and that this is not reflective\nof any broader internal policy inconsistency (Ginsburg, 1992: 28).\nConc lus ions\nThe comparison of one policy area through a health care decommodification typology\nhas been somewhat inconclusive and perhaps leaves more questions than answers. It has\nprovided indicative support to Kasza\u2019s critique of regime theory by placing a cloud over\nthe consistency and cohesion of welfare state provision within countries and the variation\nin regime composition across different policy areas. It has also highlighted that welfare\nstates cannot be accurately analysed and classified by income maintenance alone, and\nthat comparative research and the construction of typologies should try to encapsulate as\nmuch as possible of the full character of a welfare state regime by examining as many\naspects of provision and delivery as possible. However, this has not been a demolition\nof regime theory, as the health decommodification index, whilst quite critical of Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s regimes, has given support to those regime theorists who argue for more than\nthree regimes. More significantly, this process has shown that it will take more than the\ndevelopment of one specific policy comparison typology to fully address the questions\nof internal welfare consistency and the validity of regime theory. Further comparative\nresearch on other individual policy areas will be needed to fully tackle this issue and\noperationalise Kasza\u2019s critique.\n37\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 17 Jun 2009 IP address: 129.234.4.76\nClare Bambra\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded by an ESRC research bursary.
