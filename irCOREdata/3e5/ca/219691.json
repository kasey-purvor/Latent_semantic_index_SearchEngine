It is known, that as\ndeath rates increase, the relative risk becomes smaller, and\nas death rates decrease, they become larger. For example,\nrate ratios of inequalities for two diseases that have the\nsame level of inequality but one of them is twice as com-\nmon that the other one will yield different rate ratios.\nTherefore, in such cases, we need to carefully interpret var-\niations in estimates of relative health inequalities. If vari-\nations in health inequalities are mainly driven by a\nmathematical artefact, not only would conclusions from\nprevious studies providing substantial explanations be\nquestionable, but we would also have to look for new\nstrategies to assess and interpret variations in relative\nhealth inequalities across countries or population sub-\ngroups.\nThe aim of this study is to examine to what extent educa-\ntion-associated ratios for mortality and prevalence of a\nhealth outcome are correlated with underlying morbidity\nprevalence and mortality rates. We expect our study to be\na first attempt to investigate these issues by examining\nhow strong the correlation is between absolute levels of\nthe health outcome and relative measures of health ine-\nqualities. Our first hypothesis is the following:\"The magni-\ntude of prevalence ratios between high and low educated men\nand women from 6 age cohorts in 23 European nations is to a\ngreat extent dependent on the total prevalence of morbidity for\nthese men and women\". According to the HRX, this implies\nthat a linear relationship will occur between the preva-\nlence ratios and morbidity prevalence, in which the lowest\npoint of the graph will correspond to lower morbidity\nprevalence. Our second hypothesis deals with the rela-\ntionship between rate ratios and total mortality rates, in\nwhich age cohorts are the unit of the analysis: \"The magni-\ntude of rate ratios between age cohorts is to a great extent\ndependent on the total prevalence of mortality within each age\ngroup\". According to the HRX, this would mean that the\nrate ratio would be highest where the total mortality rate\nis low, and would subsequently decrease gradually with\nhigher mortality rates.\nMethods\nThe first hypothesis was tested using cross-sectional data\nfrom the first, second and third wave of the European\nSocial Survey (ESS), fielded in 2002, 2004, and 2006\nwhich comprised 108 835 individuals from 23 European\ncountries after list wise deletion. Poor health was meas-\nured as 'less than good health' from an original five point\nscaled variable providing information on the respond-\nents' general physical and mental health. The measure of\neducation was based on a variable describing full-time\neducation in years. For each country, sex and 6 age-\ncohorts (people born in the 30 s, 40 s, 50 s, 60 s, 70 s and\n80 s), we standardised the continuous scale of educational\nyears, such that the average was equal to 0 and the stand-\nard deviation equal to 1 year of education. We also\nreverted this variable by multiplying it with a factor of -1,\nsuch that higher values corresponded with lower educa-\ntional levels. Next, the standardised variable was intro-\nduced as an independent variable in a Poisson model,\ncontrolled for age and ESS-round, with poor health as the\ndependent variable. Because it has been demonstrated\nthat trends in odds ratios may overstate or understate\ntrends in relative inequality in health when the outcome\nis of relatively high prevalence [2], we have chosen the\nprevalence ratio as our relative measure for health ine-\nquality. Based on the recommendations of Spiegelman &\nHertzmark [3] the prevalence ratios (PR) were computed\nusing SAS PROC GENMOD's Poisson regression capabil-\nity with the robust variance, since it is well known that the\nlog-binomial model is less numerically stable than the\nlogistic model. The PR should be interpreted as the health\ndifference between people with average years of education\nand those whose number of year of education is one\nstandard deviation below the national average. We\nthereby take into account the extent of variations of\nreported years of education in different countries. On this\nbasis PRs were calculated, which we in turn compared to\nthe corresponding total prevalence rates.\nThe second research question was examined using data\nfrom the SEDHA and HUNT study. The HUNT study\n(1984\u20131986), a cross-sectional health survey based on a\ntotal county population in Norwegian Nord-Trondelag\ncounty (88.1% response rate), was linked to 1985 census\ndata on education, and to the national death registry in\n2003. The utilised mortality follow-up sample comprises\ndata on 61 059 men and women aged 20 years or older (1\n003 387 person-years). Education was measured on eight\nlevels of educational attainment. For each 5 years age\ngroup, low education was defined on 60\u201375% cut off\npoint of the educational distribution. Hazard rates of low\nversus high education calculated for each age group were\ncompared to total mortality rates.\nThe SEDHA study comprises longitudinal data on mortal-\nity by educational level, sex, and 5-year age group for 10\nEuropean populations.[4] Participants were enumerated\nduring a census in the early 1990s and followed up for dif-\nferent periods. Most studies covered the entire national\npopulation, except Madrid (regional), Barcelona and\nTurin (urban), Switzerland (population living in German-\nspeaking areas), and England\/Wales (1% representative\nsample of the population). Studies included individuals\naged 30 years (age specified at the start of follow-up),\nexcept in Denmark, where data on education were not\navailable for those aged 70 years. Educational level wasPage 2 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nInternational Journal for Equity in Health 2009, 8:32 http:\/\/www.equityhealthj.com\/content\/8\/1\/32first coded according to national classification schemes\nand was subsequently reclassified into 3 equivalent cate-\ngories so that the proportion of individuals with a low\neducational level was similar across populations within\neach age-group. Although small variations remained, the\nproportion of low educated men and women was 60\u2013\n70% in most age-groups. 5-year age group specific rate\nratios that compared the lowest educated with the rest of\nthe population within the same age group were calculated\nusing Poisson regression.\nResults\nFigure 1A shows the relationship between age-adjusted\nmorbidity prevalence ratios and prevalence rates for men\nand women within 6 age cohorts in 23 European coun-\ntries. There was a significant negative correlation between\nthe prevalence of poor health and associated prevalence\nratios by education (r = -0.22, p = 0.00). The figure shows\nthat this association became stronger as the prevalence of\npoor-health increased. For example, the correlation coef-\nficient calculated only among populations with preva-\nlence of 50% or higher was -0.67 (p = 0.00), while there\nwas no correlation among populations with prevalence\nbelow 50% (r = 0.08, p = 0.26). In sensitivity analysis, we\nfound roughly the same pattern of correlations when\napplying a categorical dichotomous (cut-off at lower sec-\nondary education or less) version of the education varia-\nble (r = -0.28, p = 0.00).\nFigure 1B plots rate ratios of mortality according to educa-\ntional level against total mortality rates by 5-year age\ngroup, separately for men and women aged 30 years or\nCorrelations between morbidity prevalence and prevalence ratio of reporting poor health (A) and between mortality rate and relative risk (B and C)Figur 1\nCorrelations between morbidity prevalence and prevalence ratio of reporting poor health (A) and between \nmortality rate and relative risk (B and C).

In support of the heuristic rule X, there was a signif-\nicant negative correlation between total mortality and the\nsize of the rate ratio (r = -0.41, p = 0.04). Relative risks of\nmortality by educational level were highest at low levels of\noverall mortality; they decreased gradually and were low-\nest among those with highest total mortality. The associa-\ntion increased as rates of mortality increased. For example,\namong populations above median mortality, the correla-\ntion was -0.78 (p = 0.00), while the correlation among\npopulations below the median was small and non-signif-\nicant (r = -0.19, p = 0.51).\nFigure 1C shows mortality rate ratios of low versus high\neducation plotted against the respective mortality rates for\neach 5-year age group separately for men and women in\nthe HUNT study. The correlation between total mortality\nrates and rate ratios of mortality by education was not sig-\nnificant (r = -0.37, p = 0.06). However, the correlation\nabove median mortality was negative and significant (r =\n-0.58, p = 0.03), while the correlation below the median\nwas non-significant (r = -0.34, p = 0.24).\nOverall, results provide some support for the hypothesis\nthat total mortality levels are associated with the magni-\ntude of relative risks.\nDiscussion\nWe found that the magnitude of health inequalities is\nassociated with underlying health levels. This association\nis stronger at higher levels of mortality or morbidity, while\nit is less marked at lower morbidity prevalence and mor-\ntality rates. Houweling [5] showed that both absolute and\nrelative inequality measures can be meaningful for moni-\ntoring inequalities, provided that the overall level of the\noutcome is taken into account. Our results provide further\nsupport for this view, particularly for populations and age\ngroups that experience relatively high morbidity and mor-\ntality.\nAlthough the correlation between inequalities in mortal-\nity and total mortality rates was of moderate size, our find-\nings do raise questions about the interpretation of\nvariations in mortality inequalities across countries or\nage-groups with different levels of underlying mortality.\nAt least two interpretations of our findings should be con-\nsidered. On the one hand, our results might be interpreted\nas to indicate that countries or age-groups with lower mor-\ntality tend to experience larger inequalities in mortality.\nAlthough this is plausible, it is unlikely that countries that\nhave been successful in reducing mortality rates would be\nless successful in decreasing the magnitude of inequalities\nin mortality. A second alternative explanation calls upon\nthe mathematical limits inherent to measures of relative\neffect. [5] Our findings suggest that these limits might\nyield relative risks as partly misleading if used as single\nmeasures to compare the magnitude of mortality inequal-\nities across populations or age-groups with different\nunderlying mortality levels. The main implication of this\nfinding is that measures of relative effect should prefera-\nbly be interpreted hand-by-hand with total rates and esti-\nmates of absolutes inequalities in mortality (e.g., rate\ndifferences). [5]\nWe found a significant negative correlation between the\nprevalence of poor self-rated health and the magnitude of\neducation-related inequalities in this outcome. This corre-\nlation was weaker than for mortality, suggesting that the\nimpact of absolute morbidity prevalence levels on the\nmagnitude of prevalence inequalities might be less dra-\nmatic than for mortality. On the other hand, we found\nthat correlations were strong among populations with\nhigh prevalence of poor self-rated health. Thus, our results\nsuggest that estimates of relative health inequalities\nshould also be interpreted together with estimates of\nabsolute effect that are sensitive to underlying morbidity\nprevalence levels in the population.\nIn conclusion, our findings support the view that absolute\nmorbidity prevalence and mortality levels should be con-\nsidered in the interpretation of variations in relative ine-\nqualities in health across countries or age-groups.\nAlthough correlations are of moderate size and may not\nfully explain all variation, findings from previous studies\nthat compare health inequalities across countries and age-\ngroups should be re-interpreted in the light of our find-\nings.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nTAE coordinated the paper, conducted the data analysis\nand interpretation of the European Social Survey, and\ncontributed to the write up of the paper.
