DeKeyser,  1998 ) but (b) that \ngrammar instruction that respects the learner\u2019s internal syllabus is useful \nand, at times, necessary if nativelike profi ciency is the goal of L2 teaching \n(e.g., Long & Robinson; Sharwood Smith,  1986 ). Given these premises, \nthe fi eld of SLA research has seen an increased interest in task-based lan-\n guage teaching (TBLT) over the past decade (e.g., Bygate, Skehan, & \nSwain,  2001 ; Ellis,  2003 ). Unlike traditional teaching paradigms, task-based \napproaches seek to create an environment for universal acquisitional \nprocesses (i.e., implicit and incidental learning) to take place by promot-\ning rich exposure to the target language (i.e., comprehensible input) and \nplentiful opportunities for meaningful communication (i.e., interaction \nand output). Moreover, these task-based approaches strive to combine a \nfocus on meaning with a timely focus on linguistic forms\u2014that is, shifts \nof attention to form consistent with the learner\u2019s internal syllabus. \n Despite general agreement about the necessity of incorporating a focus \non grammar into TBLT, L2 researchers\u2019 opinions seem to vary in terms of \nwhat form the pedagogical intervention should take. Among the propos-\nals that have been made so far, two have received the most attention: (a) \nLong and colleagues\u2019 suggestion to incorporate focus on form in TBLT as \na methodological principle (Long,  2000 ; Long & Crookes,  1992 ; Long & \nRobinson,  1998 ) and (b) Skehan and others\u2019 (Robinson,  2001 ,  2007 ; \nSkehan, 1998 ; Skehan & Foster,  2001 ) approach of proactively manipulat-\ning task complexity, \u201cthe (inherent) cognitive demands of tasks\u201d (Robinson, \n 2001 , p. 287), as a means to induce learner attention to form during task \nperformance (Skehan & Foster). Although these two proposals, sepa-\nrately, have been the subject of much research in recent years, few stud-\nies exist that have investigated the two together in the context of TBLT. \n The present study intends to fi ll this gap by examining how task com-\nplexity combined with focus on form affects SLA. 1  More specifi cally, the \nrelationships between the task variable contextual support, the focus-\non-form technique known as recasting, and the acquisition of the English \npast progressive form are explored. First, a brief review of the relevant \nliterature will be provided and the results will then be described and \ndiscussed. \n BACKGROUND \n Focus on Form \n As defi ned by Long ( 2000) :\n focus on form refers to how attentional resources are allocated and \n involves briefl y drawing students\u2019 attention to linguistic elements [...] in \ncontext as they arise incidentally in lessons whose overriding focus is \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 439\non meaning or communication. The temporary shifts in focal attention \nare triggered by students\u2019 problems with comprehension or production. \n(p. 185) \n This defi nition of focus on form entails two critical characteristics: \n(a) Attention to form occurs in discourse that is primarily meaning-\nbased and (b) attention to form takes place incidentally in response to \nlearners\u2019 linguistic needs. For Doughty and Williams ( 1998) , however, \nthe term  focus on form has a broader scope: It also includes planned \n attention to form\u2014that is, instruction directed at preselected linguistic \nitems in the context of meaningful language use (Ellis, Basturkmen, & \nLoewen,  2001 ). This broader defi nition was adopted here. \n Focus on form can be achieved in a variety of ways. Implicit focus- \non-form techniques seek to direct learners\u2019 attention to form unobtru-\nsively, without overt reference to rules and forms, minimizing the \ninterruption of the pedagogic intervention on the processing of mean-\ning. Conversely, explicit strategies direct learners\u2019 attention to form \nmore obtrusively, often exploiting metalinguistic information, and, as a \nresult, are more apt to intrude on the fl ow of communication. Whereas \nresearch to date suggests that explicit focus-on-form techniques are \nmore effi cient in triggering immediate restructuring of mental represen-\ntations and improvement in behavior than implicit techniques (Norris & \nOrtega,  2000 ), L2 researchers are devoting increasing attention to im-\nplicit strategies. In particular, it has been argued that implicit strategies \nare more capable of engendering the acquisition of form-meaning map-\npings (Doughty,  2003 ). \n Of all the ways implicit focus on form can be implemented, corrective \nfeedback moves, such as recasts, clarifi cation requests, comprehension \nchecks, and repetitions, have been the most investigated, and research-\ners have identifi ed several positive functions associated with these \nstrategies. Most importantly, such feedback may help learners notice \ngaps between their interlanguage (IL) and the target language system. \nNoticing, in turn, may trigger destabilization and subsequent restruc-\nturing of the L2 grammar (Gass,  1997 ; Schmidt,  2001 ). Another frequently \ncited benefi t is that implicit corrective feedback techniques may push \nlearners to modify their output and that these techniques may thus \nassist learners in gaining control over or extending their linguistic \nknowledge (McDonough,  2005 ; Swain,  1995 ). \n Recasts \n Recasts, one type of implicit corrective strategy, have received particular \nattention from SLA researchers. Recasting involves the reformulation of a \nlearner\u2019s utterance by altering one or more incorrect forms therein while \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz440\nretaining its semantic content. Example (1), obtained from data collected \nfor the current study, illustrates this technique. \n  \n (1)  Learner:  And I saw a boy next to the bar. I think he was with his girlfriend .  They \n talking to each other . \n  Recast:  They  were talking to each other . \n  \n Therefore, a recast can not only provide a targetlike model but also \n potentially indicate to a learner that his or her utterance has been er-\nroneous. In this way, the target language and the erroneous IL utter-\nances are juxtaposed, which may induce the learner to notice the gap \nand, subsequently, to make a cognitive comparison between the target-\nlike form and his or her own incorrect utterance (Doughty,  2001 ; Ellis, \n 1995 ; Long,  2007 ). The availability of the model, some have argued, may \neven assist learners in acquiring new knowledge (e.g., Long). In other \nwords, recasts may have the potential to facilitate the creation of initial \nmental representations of L2 forms. Another benefi t associated with re-\ncasts is that they are reformulations of the learners\u2019 own utterances: \nLearners can therefore be expected to understand at least part of each \nrecast given in response to their utterances because recasts are predi-\ncated on what they have just said. Thus, the learners will need to de-\nvote less attention to deciphering the meaning of the message and, in \nturn, will be able to allocate more processing resources to form and to \nform-function mapping (Long). Finally, recasts are the least intrusive of \nthe implicit corrective strategies and, as a consequence, are the most \nlikely to draw learners\u2019 peripheral attention to form without diverting \ntheir focal attention from meaning (Doughty,  2001 ) . This is an important \nadvantage, because directing learners\u2019 focal attention to form has been \nclaimed to hinder form-function mapping (Doughty,  2003 ). In contrast, \ndrawing learners\u2019 \u201croving attention to linguistic forms while the remain-\nder of selective attention remains engaged in processing meaning\u201d \n(Doughty,  2001 , p. 251) has been argued to facilitate mapping. \n The results of existing empirical studies suggest that recasts can in-\ndeed have a benefi cial impact on SLA (Mackey & Goo,  2007 ), but the \ndegree to which they do depends on several factors (Ellis & Sheen, \n 2006 ; Long,  2007 ). Some of these factors are learner-internal variables \nsuch as age (Mackey, Oliver, & Leeman,  2003 ), level of profi ciency (Lin \n& Hedgcock,  1996 ), working memory (e.g., Mackey, Philp, Egi, Fujii, & \nTatsumi,  2002 ), and developmental readiness (e.g., Long, Inagaki, & \nOrtega,  1998 ; Mackey & Philp,  1998 ; Philp,  2003 ). External factors dis-\ncussed in the literature include the learning context (e.g., Ellis et al., \n 2001 ; Loewen,  2004 ; Lyster & Mori,  2006 ; Sheen,  2004 ), the type of \n linguistic feature targeted (e.g., Jeon,  2007 ; Long), and the manner of \nrecasting (Doughty & Varela,  1998 ; Han,  2002 ; Loewen & Philp,  2006 ). \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 441\n Quite recently, task has also been identifi ed as an important factor \nthat alters the effi cacy of recasts (Long,  2007 ; Robinson,  2001 ,  2003 , \n 2005 ). For example, in a review article on recasts, Nicholas, Lightbown, \nand Spada ( 2001) noted that \u201cthe context or the task can infl uence the \nextent to which the recast is attended to\u201d (p. 731). Similarly, Gass, \nMackey, and Ross-Feldman ( 2005) , in a study that investigated interac-\ntional patterns as a function of setting, indicated that interactional pro-\ncesses may differ according to the task. Moreover, in the most recent \nreview of recasts to date, Long called for research to ascertain the ro-\nbustness of the fi ndings relating to recasts on different task types. Last \nbut not least, Robinson ( 2001) also suggested that tasks, depending \non their attentional demands, will differentially affect the effi cacy of \nrecasts. \n Task Complexity and the Multiple-Resource Framework of Attention \n In the current SLA literature, there are two competing accounts of \nhow attention is deployed during task performance: the single- \nresource model (e.g., Skehan & Foster,  2001 ) and the multiple-resource \nmodel (e.g., Robinson,  2003 ; Wickens,  1992 ,  2007 ), each carrying a \ndifferent set of implications as to what task variables may facilitate \nthe noticing of morphosyntactic features. The attentional framework \nselected for this study was the multiple-resource view of attention. \nThis model makes a distinction between separate resource pools \nalong three dichotomous dimensions: processing stages (i.e., per-\nception vs. response), modality (i.e., auditory perception with vocal \nresponse vs. visual perception with manual response), and codes of \nprocessing (i.e., verbal vs. spatial); each of these resource pools is \nresponsible for a different aspect of task performance. The model \n(Robinson) holds that the relative ease or diffi culty of a task will de-\npend on the interference (i.e., confusion and cross talk) between \nsimilar codes or the competition for the same types of codes within \nspecifi c resource pools along these three dimensions. In Wickens\u2019s \n( 2007) words, interference will be higher \u201cto the extent that any two \ntasks share common levels along more dimensions\u201d (p. 187) ; that \nis, task performance is constrained by the potential breakdown in \ntask-switching and scheduling operations due to interference and \ncompetition. \n In addition to adopting a multiple-resource view of attention, Robinson \n(e.g., 2001, 2003) distinguished between two groups of task variables\u2014\nresource-dispersing and resource-directing dimensions\u2014to explain task \neffects. Increasing task complexity along resource-dispersing dimensions \n(e.g., by requiring learners to perform more than one task simultaneously \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz442\nand without prior knowledge) disperses attention over many nonspecifi c \nareas of the L2. In contrast, increasing task complexity along resource-\ndirecting dimensions (e.g., by requiring learners to refer to events dis-\nplaced in time and space) can direct learners\u2019 attention to specifi c, \ntask-relevant features of the language code within the same resource \npool. Tasks displaced in time, for example, will probably induce the use \nof past tense morphology. Robinson argued that increases in task com-\nplexity along resource-directing dimensions, as a result of a focus on spe-\ncifi c forms, may induce learners to pay increased attention to input and \noutput. \n Task Complexity and Recasts \n Robinson (e.g., 2001, 2005), within the scope of the cognition hypoth-\nesis of task-based language learning, proposed a series of predictions \nas to how increases in task complexity along resource-dispersing or \nresource-directing dimensions, or both, may affect L2 development \nand modulate the effectiveness of focus-on-form interventions. With \nspecifi c reference to recasts, Robinson and Gilabert ( 2007) recently \nmade explicit that this model predicts that increasing task demands \n\u201calong resource-directing dimensions, and in general too along re-\nsource-dispersing dimensions\u201d (p. 167), will lead to more extensive \nnoticing, a greater amount of uptake, and longer term retention \nof input made salient by recasts. As Robinson ( 2001) explained, \n\u201cincreasingly complex tasks may prompt learners to look for more \nand more help in the input, attending to facilitative forms made \nsalient by teacher intervention using [\u2026] focus on form techniques\u201d \n(p. 304). \n To date, there is little empirical research to offer insights on the va-\nlidity of this prediction. Only one study (R\u00e9v\u00e9sz & Han,  2006 ), set out \nto explore the relationship between recasts and task complexity. This \npilot study, in which all experimental groups received recasts, exam-\nined whether changes in task content familiarity and task type would \ninfl uence the effi cacy of recasts. Although results from ANOVAs \nshowed signifi cant main effects for both independent variables, par-\nticipants showed greater use of recasts when performing less complex \ntasks, contrary to Robinson and Gilabert\u2019s ( 2007) prognosis. However, \ngiven a number of methodological weaknesses (for instance, the fact \nthat no true control group was included in the design) these fi ndings \ncan only be suggestive. One of the major goals of the present study, \ntherefore, was to further explore the joint effects of recasts and task \ncomplexity on L2 learning while circumventing the weaknesses of \nR\u00e9v\u00e9sz and Han\u2019s study. \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 443\n Task Complexity and L2 Learning \n A second major goal of the current study was motivated by Skehan and \nFoster\u2019s ( 2001) proposal for integrating a focus on form into task-based \ninstruction. Based on their information processing approach, Skehan \nand Foster claimed that learners\u2019 opportunities to focus on form should \nbe maximized through attentional manipulation of task variables in the \ncontext of TBLT. For Skehan and Foster, tasks can be designed and im-\nplemented such that learners will place enhanced attention on form or, \nto be precise, on the two performance dimensions of form: accuracy \n(i.e., using the target language correctly) and complexity (i.e., using ad-\nvanced and elaborate IL structures). (Note that, here, the term  complexity , \nwhen used to describe linguistic performance, refers to syntactic as op-\nposed to lexical complexity.) Balanced development in morphosyntax \nwill thus be achieved by sequencing tasks in such a way that focus on \none aspect of form (e.g., complexity) is reinforced by focus on the other \n(e.g., accuracy). In other words, Skehan and Foster contended that pro-\nactive manipulation of task design can promote L2 learning. Ellis ( 2005) \nalso appeared to share this position, arguing that task variables that \nhave the capacity to promote an increased focus on language form dur-\ning performance are also likely to have the capacity to lead to greater IL \ndevelopment. Similarly, Robinson\u2019s ( 2001 ,  2007) cognition hypothesis \nsuggests that task complexity manipulations may have direct effects on \nL2 learning. \n In particular, Robinson (e.g., 2005) predicted that more complex tasks \nalong resource-dispersing dimensions will facilitate automatization of, \nand real-time access to, an already established and developing IL \nsystem, as these tasks increasingly simulate real-world procedural and \nperformance conditions. In contrast, more complex tasks along re-\nsource-directing dimensions and the increased conceptual and cogni-\ntive demands they entail will direct learners\u2019 attention to the overlaps \nand divergences of the conceptual systems of the fi rst language (L1) \nand the L2 as well as to the ways in which concepts are grammaticized \nin the two languages, which will eventually lead to the development of \nnew L2 form-function mappings. More specifi cally, increasing task com-\nplexity along resource-directing dimensions, among other things, will \nlead to heightened attention to speech production, which will result in \ngreater accuracy and complexity of L2 output as well as more extensive \nIL analysis of task-relevant L2 constructions. \n Whereas it appears plausible that manipulating the complexity of \ntasks along resource-directing dimensions has the potential to facilitate \nIL analysis, it is less obvious that more complex (resource-directing) \ntasks will always provide suffi cient psycholinguistic conditions for ana-\nlytical processes to be triggered. In terms of the multiple-resource \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz444\nmodel, resource-directing dimensions rely on the same, verbal resource \npool (Robinson,  2003 ; see also Kormos,  2000 ). Thus, when the increased \nconceptual demands posed by a task draw on form-function relations \ngrammaticized differently in the L1 and the L2, for example, the compe-\ntition and interference that may ensue between codes might need to \ntake place in this resource pool. 2 In other words, enhanced complexity \nalong resource-directing dimensions, although capable of directing \nlearners\u2019 attention to specifi c areas of the L2, might at times, due to in-\nterference between L1 and L2 cues, simultaneously result in competi-\ntion and interference in the verbal resource pool and, hence, inhibit \nthese processes of IL analysis. \n One might argue that in such cases\u2014and in general\u2014decreasing task \ncomplexity along resource-dispersing dimensions may help generate the \nsuffi cient psycholinguistic prerequisites for the creation of new form-\nfunction mappings. The decreased demands on task-switching and the \nscheduling mechanisms that the manipulation of tasks along such dimen-\nsions have the capacity to induce can free up attentional resources in the \nverbal resource pool, among others. 3 This, in turn, might enable learners to \nallocate more attention to aspects of the L1 and L2 systems needed to meet \nthe conceptual and linguistic demands posed by a task and, therefore, in-\ncrease the likelihood that the predicted positive effects of task complexity \nalong resource-directing dimensions are achieved. Similarly, Robinson \n( 2005) noted that the impact of task manipulations along resource-directing \nfeatures \u201ccan be expected to be stronger when the task is simultaneously \nsimpler along one or more resource-dispersing dimensions\u201d (p. 7). So it \nwould appear that, in addition to ensuring that a task is adequately com-\nplex along resource-directing dimensions to facilitate IL analysis, decreases \nin task complexity along resource-dispersing dimensions may also be facili-\ntative of, and occasionally necessary to promote, processes linked to the \nacquisition of new form-function mappings. \n As was the case for the link between recasts and task complexity, \nfew empirical studies are available to confi rm or refute the validity of \nthis line of reasoning. Notably, however, the studies by Bygate ( 1996) \nand Gass, Mackey, Fernandez, and Alvarez-Torres ( 1999) \u2014two empiri-\ncal studies that have examined the effects of a resource-dispersing \ndimension task content familiarity (i.e., a form of prior knowledge) on \nshort-term development of specifi c L2 features\u2014found trends in line \nwith this prediction. It is also worth noting that the most robust study \nthat has investigated task complexity in relation to the learning of lin-\nguistic forms (Nuevo,  2006 ) did not detect an effect for task complexity; \nhowever, Nuevo focused on a resource-directing dimension. It is clear \nthat more empirical studies are needed to elucidate the relationship \nbetween task variables and the acquisition of L2 forms. Another major \ngoal of the present study, therefore, was to contribute to this underex-\nplored area of research. \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 445\n +\/\u2212 Contextual Support or the +\/\u2212 Here-and-Now Dimension \n This study explores the effects of manipulating task complexity along \nthe +\/\u2212 contextual support dimension, or the +\/\u2212 here-and-now dimension, \nin relation to recasts and L2 morphosyntactic development. The \n\u2212contextual support, or the there-and-then, condition was regarded \nas more complex, because tasks that require context-supported refer-\nence, such as narrating a story when picture prompts are available, \nare considered less cognitively demanding than those that require \n reference to objects or events without contextual support, such as \nnarrating a story from memory, without picture prompts (Ellis,  2003 ; \nRobinson,  1995 ). The theoretical rationale for this premise is based on \nL1 and L2 acquisition fi ndings that the ability to refer to events dis-\nplaced in time and place emerges later than the ability to describe \ncontiguous events (e.g., Bardovi-Harlig,  2000 ). \n To use Robinson\u2019s ( 2001 ,  2005) terminology, the +\/\u2212 here-and-now di-\nmension of a task is resource-directing, because it has the capacity to \ndraw learners\u2019 attention to specifi c L2 forms. For example, present time \nreference is more likely to be used under the here-and-now condition, \nwhereas past time reference is more likely to be used under the there-\nand-then condition. As a result, the cognition hypothesis (Robinson, \n 2001 ,  2007 ) predicts that increased demands along this dimension will \npromote the effi cacy of recasts as well as L2 learning. \n Although there is little research that investigated the direct effects of \nthe +\/\u2212 contextual support dimension on the noticing of recasts and L2 \ndevelopment, several studies have investigated the effects of this dimen-\nsion on oral production. In Robinson\u2019s ( 1995) study, participants were \nasked to narrate picture stories in the present tense while looking at pic-\nture prompts (here-and-now) and, also, to describe picture stories from \nmemory in the past tense, after having seen the cartoon strips (there-\nand-then). Each participant performed three narratives altogether\u2014at \nleast one story with visual support and at least one without such sup-\nport. Sequence (i.e., the order of presentation of the stories and the \npresence or absence of visual support), cartoon strip, and condition \n(+\/\u2212 here-and-now) were counterbalanced. The results revealed an ad-\nvantage for the there-and-then condition in terms of accuracy. These \npositive effects, however, did not prove to be signifi cant in Robinson\u2019s \nstudy. A partial replication study by Rahimpour ( 1997) , on the other \nhand, found this trend toward greater accuracy to be statistically sig-\nnifi cant. Similarly, Iwashita, Elder, and McNamara ( 2001) , in a much \nlarger scale study, observed that narrating picture stories under the \nthere-and-then condition led to signifi cantly greater accuracy than nar-\nrating picture stories under the here-and-now  condition. Gilabert \n( 2007) also found that there-and-then narratives  resulted in signifi cantly \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz446\nmore accurate language use than their here-and-now counterparts. \nFinally, Ishikawa ( 2007) detected greater accuracy on written there-and-\nthen tasks. It is important to note that none of the studies that \ninvestigated oral performance revealed signifi cant effects for syntactic \ncomplexity (cf. Ishikawa). \n In contrast, a study by Skehan and Foster ( 1999) yielded an effect for \nlinguistic complexity during oral production. In that study, learners in \na watch-and-tell condition had to simultaneously watch and tell a \nMr. Bean video (here-and-now and +contextual support), whereas learn-\ners in a watch-then-tell condition had to narrate the story after watch-\ning the video (there-and-then and \u2212contextual support). Comparing the \nlearners\u2019 performance under these two conditions, Skehan and Foster \nobserved that the watch-then-tell condition led to greater complexity; \nhowever, there were no effects for accuracy. \n In sum, in line with the cognition hypothesis (Robinson,  2001 ,  2007 ), \nthese studies have demonstrated that there-and-then tasks can induce \nincreased attention to form. Contrary to the cognition hypothesis, \nhowever, no study that examined oral production thus far has found \nsignifi cant effects for accuracy and complexity simultaneously. The \npositive impact of increased task complexity along the +\/\u2212 here-and-now \n(resource-directing) dimension might have proved to be stronger in \nthese studies had the tasks been concurrently made less complex along \nresource-dispersing dimensions. In fact, in the study by Gilabert ( 2007) , \nalbeit not reaching statistical signifi cance, the positive effects of in-\ncreased complexity along the +\/\u2212 here-and-now dimension appeared \nto be enhanced when planning time was made available. \n One explanation for the mixed fi ndings may be that empirical research \nto date has typically treated the +\/\u2212 here-and-now dimension and the \n+\/\u2212 contextual support dimension as a monolithic entity. In terms of \nRobinson\u2019s ( 2001 ,  2005) task framework, however, these two variables \nappear separable and rather different in nature: The +\/\u2212 here-and-now \nvariable is argued to be resource-directing, whereas the variable con-\ntextual support seems to be resource-dispersing. Although the pres-\nence of contextual support (e.g., a photo) allows learners to focus their \nattention primarily on speech production, its absence requires an ad-\nditional effort to memorize, and later retrieve, the details of the prompt \nemployed in the task. 4 In other words, the two conditions appear to \npose respectively single versus dual demands, a distinction that, in \nRobinson\u2019s task framework, is considered resource-dispersing. \n As a consequence, the current practice of operationalizing the +\/\u2212 \nhere-and-now dimension as the availability or unavailability of contex-\ntual support during task performance appears problematic. When \noperationalized this way, the +\/\u2212 here-and-now condition seems to con-\nstitute a composite task variable, distinguished not only by resource-\ndirecting characteristics but also by resource-dispersing characteristics. \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 447\nNot less problematic would be if studies, when operationalizing the +\/\u2212 \ncontextual support dimension, would induce participants to narrate in \nthe past tense when they have no contextual support and in the present \ntense when contextual support is available. Such an operationalization \nwould make it impossible to determine whether it is the differential \nlinguistic diffi culty posed by the tasks or the presence versus absence \nof contextual support that is responsible for any effects observed. \nIn the present study, to establish the impact of the variable +\/\u2212 contex-\ntual support on its own, learners were prompted to use the same time \nframe under both the \u2212contextual support and +contextual support \nconditions. 5 \n RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES \n The following research questions and hypotheses were addressed:\n  \n  1.  What are the combined effects of recasts and task complexity on L2 mor-\nphosyntactic development? \n  \n Based on the cognition hypothesis (Robinson,  2001 ,  2007 ), it was pre-\ndicted that learners who had received recasts when contextual support \nwas not available would show greater development than learners who \nhad received recasts when contextual support was available. \n  \n  2.  Does task complexity, in the absence of recasts, have an impact on mor-\nphosyntactic development? \n  \n Again, based on the cognition hypothesis (Robinson,  2001 ,  2007 ), it was \nexpected that learners who had performed tasks when contextual sup-\nport was available would show greater development than learners who \nhad performed tasks when no contextual support was available. \n Note that  morphosyntactic development was operationalized as improve-\nment in the learners\u2019 ability to use the English past progressive form. \n METHOD \n Design \n The study employed a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest design, with 90 \nparticipants randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups and \na control group (see  Table 1 ). The control group only participated in the \npretest and posttests, whereas each experimental group took part in \nthree treatment sessions between the pretest and the posttest. The \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz448\nexperimental groups differed as to (a) whether they received recasts \nwhile describing photos during the treatment (recast groups vs. nonre-\ncast groups) and (b) whether they had contextual support available \nwhile describing photos (+photo groups vs. \u2212photo groups).  Contextual \nsupport was operationalized as the availability versus unavailability of a \nphoto during its description. At each testing session, three tasks were \nused to assess the extent of learning triggered by the respective treat-\nments: a written description task, an oral description task with photo \nsupport, and an oral description task without photo support. The de-\nlayed posttest was only administered to half of the participants in each \ngroup. The rest of the participants completed an exit questionnaire af-\nter completing the posttest. 6 \n The fi rst research question was examined by assessing the perfor-\nmance of the +photo recast group against that of the \u2212photo recast \ngroup, whereas the second research question was investigated by com-\nparing the extent of development shown by the +photo and the \u2212photo \nnonrecast group. \n Target Form \n Recasts in the current study targeted the past progressive form. The ratio-\nnale for choosing this particular form was twofold. First, it is realized via a \nfree morpheme ( was or  were ) and a syllabic bound morpheme (\u2013 ing ); thus, \n Table 1.

Second, it de-\nnotes grammatical tense and aspect, which means that it has some \ncommunicative value. It has been argued that recasts are more likely to \ndraw learners\u2019 attention to linguistic forms that fi t the criteria of being \nphysically salient and meaning-bearing (Long,  2007 ). \n The experimental tasks elicited only one context of the past progres-\nsive, generally considered to be the prototypical usage of this form: The \npast progressive referred to something in progress at a particular time \nin the past (e.g.,  He was jogging at 7 o\u2019clock last night ). As demonstrated \nby Bardovi-Harlig ( 2000) , the past progressive is a developmental fea-\nture, which means that learners pass through relatively fi xed develop-\nmental stages when learning it. Specifi cally, Bardovi-Harlig identifi ed \nthree stages, as illustrated in (2), in the emergence of this form:\n  \n (2)  a. bare progressive (e.g.,  walking ) \n  b. present progressive (e.g.,  is walking ) \n  c. past progressive (e.g.,  was walking ) \n  \n In light of Bardovi-Harlig\u2019s fi ndings, participants were considered devel-\nopmentally ready, and thus eligible for participating in this study, if the \npresent progressive form had emerged in their IL.  Emergence was opera-\ntionalized as producing the present progressive form at least twice with \nunique lexical items in a past progressive context on the pretest. This is \nsimilar to the criterion used in other acquisition studies that consid-\nered emergence (e.g., Mackey,  1999 ; Philp,  2003 ). Participants who \nshowed accurate use of the target form on the pretest were eliminated \nfrom the study. \n Participants \n The 90 participants were learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) \nenrolled in elementary or preintermediate language classes in three \nhigh schools in Hungary. The pedagogical approach adopted by the \nschools was a mix of focus-on-forms and communicative language in-\nstruction. The students were placed in their classes either based on the \nresults of a placement test administered at the beginning of the school \nyear or due to the successful completion of a prior-level course. The \nwritten part of the pretest was administered to 139 students from 11 in-\ntact classes. The classes were selected with the help of expert opinions \nof teachers from the three institutions. Only classes that had not re-\nceived prior instruction on the past progressive were administered the \npretest. Each participant had been in his or her current class for at least \n6 months at the onset of the experiment. Of the initial 139 participants, \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz450\n105 students, who showed no use of the past progressive form on the \nwritten pretest, took the oral pretest. Based on the overall pretest re-\nsults, 95 students proved developmentally ready for the target form and \nthus eligible to participate; however, two students had to withdraw due \nto scheduling confl icts. Of the remaining 93 students, 90 randomly se-\nlected students were invited to continue the study. \n For all fi ve groups combined, there were 47 female and 43 male stu-\ndents. The participants\u2019 ages ranged from 15 to 20 ( M = 16;87,  SD = 1;42) \nand they were all native speakers of Hungarian. They had received be-\ntween 0.5 and 8 years of English instruction prior to the study ( M = 2.68, \n SD = 2.37). Most of the students had never visited an English-speaking \ncountry, with the exception of four students who had attended a 2-week \nEnglish course in Great Britain. One-way ANOVAs run on the variable \nage and length of previous English study confi rmed that there were no \nsignifi cant differences among the fi ve groups with regard to these vari-\nables:  F (4, 85) = 0.381,  p = .822 and  F (4, 85) = 0.480,  p = .751, respectively. \n Treatment \n Tasks.  The treatment tasks were contextualized in the hypothetical \nscenario that the participants were taking photos in a New York City \nneighborhood (e.g., Soho) exactly at a time when a crime (e.g., a bank \nrobbery) happened in that area. During the experiment, the partici-\npants\u2019 task was to describe their photos to the researcher, who played \nthe role of a police offi cer. The participants were told that they should \ndescribe each activity in the photos carefully, because the police would \nlike to know what everybody was doing at the time the crime occurred. \nIn each photo, at least three people were engaged in clearly identifi able \nactivities, such as sitting, painting, or walking. \n Three versions of the treatment task in two formats\u2014one for the +photo \ngroups and one for the \u2212photo groups\u2014were developed. The tasks were \ncreated using the computer program Microsoft PowerPoint. The fi rst slide \nof each presentation displayed the title (e.g.,  Soho ) for 5 s and was followed \nby a slide that contained the task instructions, which were visible for 2 min. \nThen, after the researcher had orally checked that the participants under-\nstood the task, 10 photos were presented. With each photo, a title appeared \non the screen that indicated the time at which the photo had been taken. \nThis title disappeared after 10 s under both the +photo and \u2212photo condi-\ntions. Next, participants were asked to describe the photo in 40 s. The \n\u2212photo groups could only see a blank screen while speaking, whereas for \nthe +photo groups, the photo remained available on the screen. \n This task was piloted with beginning-level L2 learners to determine \nthe adequate time intervals allocated to view the photos. A 10-s initial \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 451\nexposure to the photos was established to be appropriate in that it pro-\nvided learners with just enough time to identify the activities but did \nnot allow for engaging in other thought processes. This latter aspect \nwas considered crucial because when more time was made available \nduring the pilot study, learners under the +photo versus \u2212photo condi-\ntions tended to be involved in distinct cognitive processes. As posttask \ninterviews revealed, whereas learners in the \u2212photo groups, for the \nmost part, focused on memorizing the activities for later recall during \nthe additional time, their counterparts in the +photo groups were pri-\nmarily concerned with how they were going to formulate their subse-\nquent speech. The rationale for allotting 40 s to describe each photo \nwas that this time period, for most learners, proved suffi cient to per-\nform the task without feeling pressured. \n The three versions of the task were piloted on 10 native speakers of \nEnglish and 17 beginning-level Hungarian learners of English. The native \nbaseline data indicated that the tasks generated approximately the \nsame number of obligatory contexts for the target form and that the use \nof the structure was natural in each task. The three versions were also \nfound comparable in terms of lexical variation (measured by type and \ntoken ratio) and syntactic complexity (measured by number of clauses \nper T-unit\u2014that is, an independent clause with all its dependent clauses) \nbased on both the native baseline and the EFL learner data. \n Recasts.  During the treatment sessions, the participants in the recast \ngroups consistently received recasts from the researcher when they er-\nroneously used the past progressive. The recasts were typically of the \nsimple isolated declarative type; that is, they targeted a single error and \nwere provided with falling intonation, without added emphasis on the \ntargeted feature (Kim & Han,  2007 ; Lyster,  1998 ). A small number of re-\ncasts were also provided, albeit randomly, in response to other IL forms. \n Assessment Tasks and Scoring \n The pretest, the posttest, and the delayed posttest consisted of three \ntasks: a written picture description task, an oral photo description task \nwith photo support, and an oral photo description task without photo \nsupport. Three different but comparable versions of each of the tests \nwere developed. These were administered in a split-block design to \navoid any potential task effects. \n Written Picture Description Task.  The goal of this task was to gauge \nthe learners\u2019 ability to use the past progressive during a written pro-\nduction task. The inclusion of a written test in the design was consid-\nered important for two reasons. First, participants\u2019 performance on the \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz452\nwritten task would reveal whether the effects of the oral treatment \n(or lack thereof) had transferred to the written modality. Second, it \nwas deemed possible that some learners would produce more devel-\noped language in writing than they would orally (Bardovi-Harlig,  2000 ). \n The picture the participants were asked to describe showed eight peo-\nple engaged in various activities in a park. The written instruction contex-\ntualized the picture as having been taken at a particular time of the day \nand asked the participants to describe what the people were doing at that \ntime. Three versions of the task were piloted on 6 native speakers and 15 \nEFL learners. The results demonstrated that each picture generated the \nsame number of obligatory contexts for the target form, of approximately \nthe same level of syntactic and lexical complexity. Ten minutes were allot-\nted for the task. \n The coding of the data consisted of four steps. The fi rst step was to \nidentify the obligatory contexts for the past progressive. Then it was de-\ntermined whether any progressive marking had been produced in these \ncontexts. Next, the data were analyzed in terms of four categories based \non the developmental sequence for the progressive (Bardovi-Harlig,  2000 ). \nIn obligatory contexts, participants received 3 points for using the past \nprogressive, 2 points for using the present progressive, 1 point for the bare \nprogressive, and 0 points for any nonprogressive form. The participants\u2019 \ntotal score was calculated using the formula provided in Equation  1 : \nT N= \u2211 \u00d7\n=\np \/ 3i\ni\nN\n1\n. (1)\n In Equation  1,  T is the total score on the task,  \u03a3 is the sum,  N is the total \nnumber of obligatory contexts, and  p is the number of points received \nfor each obligatory context. Thus, the total score demonstrated the \nmean proportion of targetlike and IL use of the past progressive. In ad-\ndition to the total scores on each test, a pretest-posttest or a pretest-\ndelayed posttest gain score was computed. \n After all data had been coded and verifi ed by a second researcher, \nintercoder agreement was determined by comparing the fi rst rater\u2019s \ncoding with that of the second rater. The second rater scored 20% per-\ncent of the data, randomly selected across the fi ve groups. Cohen\u2019s \nkappa was .96, demonstrating strong intercoder agreement. \n Oral Photo Description Tasks.  The pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest \neach employed two oral production tasks: a photo description task with \nvisual support and a photo description task without such support. These \ntasks were similar to the treatment tasks, except for being shorter in \nlength: Instead of 10, participants were required to describe 5 photos. Six \nversions of the task in two formats\u2014a +photo and a \u2212photo version\u2014were \ndeveloped. The different versions were subjected to the same  piloting \n procedures as the treatment tasks. The sequence of the six versions in \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 453\neach group was counterbalanced within the testing sessions. Additionally, \nthe order in which learners were asked to describe the photos under the \n+photo versus \u2212photo conditions was counterbalanced. \n The participants\u2019 oral production, altogether 87 h of oral data, was \ntape-recorded, transcribed, and then coded and scored following the \nsame procedure as for the written picture description task. To ensure the \nreliability of the transcriptions and the coding, 10% of the data was ran-\ndomly selected and also transcribed and coded by a second researcher. \nIntertranscriber agreement, calculated by dividing the total number of \nitems transcribed identically by the total number of items transcribed, \nwas high (.971). Cohen\u2019s kappa for intertranscriber agreement was also \nfound to be high (.942). Intercoder agreement was determined by the \nsame procedure used for the written description task. The Cohen\u2019s kappa \nvalues for the oral description task with versus without photo support \nwere .94 and .90, respectively, indicating strong intercoder agreement. \n Exit Questionnaire.  The goal of the exit questionnaire was to obtain \ninformation concerning the participants\u2019 perspectives on their own ex-\nperiences throughout the experiment. The questions required partici-\npants to write their responses in Hungarian. Out of the six questions \nasked, only one, provided in (3), is relevant to the present article. \n  \n (3)  Was it easier to describe the photos when you could or when you could not \nsee them? Why? \n  \n The analysis of the exit questionnaire data involved three phases. First, \nthe researcher reviewed the learners\u2019 responses and identifi ed emer-\ngent categories by annotating the data. Second, the resulting annota-\ntions were grouped into more general themes. Finally, the researcher \ndouble-checked all of the annotations and themes of the content analy-\nsis. The same three steps were repeated a month later to ensure the \nconsistency of coding. The Cohen\u2019s kappa value demonstrated a high \nlevel of intracoder agreement (.92). \n Data Collection Procedures \n The data were collected over a time span of 5 months. Each participant \nattended six to seven sessions over the course of 6 weeks. On the fi rst \nday of the experiment, the written description pretest was given to the \nparticipants during normally scheduled class times. As soon as the writ-\nten pretest was completed, the researcher scored the tests and, based \non the results, invited learners who appeared developmentally ready \nto acquire the target form to participate in the oral pretest. Learners \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz454\nwere subjected to the oral pretest individually on a different day within \nthe same week. Based on the oral pretest data, students who proved eli-\ngible for the study were invited to continue. The written and oral pre-\ntest both lasted 10 min. The treatment, which consisted of three \nsessions, started approximately a week after the pretest and took place \non three separate days over a 1-week period. The treatment sessions \nlasted 15 min each. The day after the last treatment session, the partici-\npants were administered the posttest, and half of the learners, randomly \nselected from each group, also received an exit questionnaire. The rest \nof the participants performed a delayed posttest 4 weeks later. Both \nposttests and the exit questionnaire were administered to participants \nindividually. The posttests lasted approximately 20 min, and partici-\npants were given 30 min to complete the exit questionnaire. In an at-\ntempt to control for exposure to the target forms outside of the \nexperiment, the teachers of the participating EFL classes were asked \nnot to focus on the target form during the period of data collection. \n Statistical Analyses \n As a fi rst step, descriptive statistics were calculated for each group\u2019s \nperformance on the three assessment tasks of the pretest, posttest, \nand delayed posttest. Next, intercoder agreement was determined for \nthe three testing tasks by comparing the two raters\u2019 coding and scor-\ning of the data. To examine the effects of the treatment on the partici-\npants\u2019 ability to use the target form, many-facet Rasch measurement \n(MFRM) was employed (Linacre,  1989 ). MFRM is an extension of the \nsimple Rasch model, which computes item and person estimates con-\ncurrently and produces measures for each of these estimates on a true \ninterval scale, known as the  logit scale . Unlike the simple Rasch model, \nMFRM allows not only item diffi culty and person ability to be estimated \nbut also the effects of other facets (i.e., defi nable aspects of the mea-\nsurement condition) that may contribute to test score variation. MFRM, \ntherefore, can be applied to analyze data obtained through experimen-\ntal designs, among other things. Specifi cally, group can be specifi ed as \na facet in addition to participants and test items, and the impact, or the \nlack thereof, of the group facet on participants\u2019 pretest-posttest gains \ncan thus be estimated on the same scale as that of the other facets. \n In addition to calculating logit estimates for each facet, MFRM analy-\nsis also computes the signifi cance of any differences that may exist \namong elements of a given facet (e.g., differences in gains among \nexperimental groups). Another important feature of MFRM is that it \nprovides fi t statistics for each element, which indicate how well the \ndata fi t the stochastic expectation of the model. In the case of group \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 455\neffects, for instance, the fi t statistics show how consistently the facet \ngroup impacted participants\u2019 performance. \n For the current study, the MFRM analysis was performed using Facets \n3.61 for the IBM (Linacre,  2006 ). The model used for the analysis was \nthe rating scale model, which assumes that the steps of a scale are \nequivalent across all elements of a given facet. The MFRM analysis was \nspecifi ed as having four facets: (a) participants\u2019 gains, (b) group, (c) \ntime (posttest vs. delayed posttest), and (d) the diffi culty of testing tasks. \nThe mathematical model used for the analysis is provided in Equation  2 : \nlog(P B C D E Fnjikx njikx n j i k ix\/ ) = P\n\u22121 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 , (2)\n where  P njikx is the probability of participant  n achieving a gain score of  x \non testing task  i in group  j at time  k ,  P njikx  \u2212 1 is the probability of partici-\npant  n achieving a gain score of  x \u2212 1 on testing task  i in group  j at time  k , \n B n is the pretest-posttest gain of participant  n ,  C j = assignment to group  j , \n D i is the diffi culty of testing task  i ,  E k = testing at time  k , and  F ix = diffi culty \nof achieving a gain score of  x on a particular testing task  i . \n The analysis was conducted on the pretest-posttest and pretest-\ndelayed posttest gain scores obtained from the written and oral de-\nscription tasks. The data were originally modeled on a 100-point rating \nscale to correspond to the range of percentage scores obtained. How-\never, the MFRM analysis yielded disordered average measures and step \ncalibrations for this scale, which indicated problems with the function-\ning of the scale. 7 Therefore, the percentage scores were collapsed into a \n6-point rating scale by recoding the data (Linacre, personal communica-\ntion, November 26, 2006). Although rating scales with different step \nstructures were also tested, the 6-point scale appeared best for repre-\nsenting the current dataset, because it included the most categories \nwhile still yielding ordered average measures and step calibrations. \n The mean ability value of each group was anchored at 0 logits. In this way, \nit was ensured that there was enough connectivity in the dataset, which, \ndue to the between-subjects design, would otherwise have contained dis-\njoint subsets. Given that the participants were assigned to the experimental \nand control groups at random, the mean ability of the participants assigned \nto each group is assumed to be randomly equivalent. Except for the facet \ntasks, the mean diffi culty of each facet was set at 0 logits. \n RESULTS \n Number of Recasts \n As illustrated in  Table 2 , the mean number of recasts gradually decreased \nfor both recast groups during the treatment, with the +photo recast group \nreceiving a moderately greater number of recasts during each treatment \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz456\nsession than the \u2212photo recast group. 8 This indicates that both recast \ngroups made fewer errors over the course of the treatment sessions and \nthat the participants in the \u2212photo recast group correctly produced the \ntarget form more frequently than their counterparts in the +photo recast \ngroup. In parallel, standard deviations for the +photo recast group were \nhigher than for the \u2212photo recast group, which demonstrate a larger de-\ngree of variability for the +photo recast group. Independent samples \n t -tests based on the number of recasts given to the +photo versus the \n\u2212photo recast group during the treatment yielded no signifi cant differ-\nence between the groups for any of the three treatment sessions: For the \nfi rst session,  F (1, 34) = 2.39,  p = .13, for the second session,  F (1, 34) = 1.05, \n p = .31, and for the third session,  F (1, 34) = 3.67,  p = .07. \n Descriptive Statistics for the Dependent Variables \n Oral Description Task With Photo Support.  Table 3 presents the descrip-\ntive statistics for the scores on the oral description task with photo \nsupport. Both recast groups exhibited a considerable gain from the pre-\ntest to the posttest, with the \u2212photo recast group demonstrating mod-\nerately larger gain than the +photo recast group. The +\/\u2212 photo nonrecast \ngroups showed a small increase of .08. The control group displayed no \nchange from the pretest to the posttests. On the delayed posttest, the \n+photo recast group and the \u2212photo nonrecast group maintained their \nrespective gains. In contrast, the \u2212photo recast group and the +photo \nnonrecast group showed respectively a slight decrease and increase in \ntheir use of the past progressive. \n Oral Description Task Without Photo Support.  The descriptive statistics \nfor the scores on the oral description task without photo support are \nprovided in  Table 3 . The \u2212photo recast group exhibited the largest gain, \n Table 2.

The \u2212photo nonrecast \ngroup showed a substantially lower gain but somewhat higher than the \n+photo nonrecast group. The control group displayed a slight increase \nfrom the pretest to the posttest. On the delayed posttest, the +photo \nrecast group maintained its gain, whereas the \u2212photo recast group \nshowed a slight loss. The +photo and the \u2212photo nonrecast groups, on \nthe other hand, exhibited a small increase compared to the posttest. \nThe control group did not maintain its gain on the delayed posttest. \n Written Description Task.  The descriptive statistics for the written de-\nscription task are provided in  Table 4 . As on the oral measures, the \u2212photo \nrecast group improved the most, followed by the +photo recast group, \nthe \u2212photo nonrecast group, and the +photo nonrecast group. The con-\ntrol group also showed a small increase compared to the pretest. All \ngroups, however, exhibited a decrease from the posttest to the delayed \nposttest, with the \u2212photo nonrecast group demonstrating the greatest \ndecrease and the \u2212photo recast group demonstrating the least decrease. \n Table 3.

The fi rst column in the fi gure displays the logit scale. The logit \nscale is an equal-interval scale, which provides a single frame of refer-\nence for all the facets of the MFRM analysis, which allows for compari-\nsons both within and between the facets. The second column presents \nthe distribution of the pretest-posttest gain scores on the written and \noral description tasks in logits. Each asterisk (*) represents one par-\nticipant\u2019s gain score. Participants with higher gains appear at the top \nof the column and participants with lower gains appear at the bottom \nof the column. The column shows that there was considerable varia-\ntion in participants\u2019 gain estimates on the oral and written production \ntasks (approximately \u22122 to 3.5 logits). The third column represents the \nvariation in the testing tasks in terms of diffi culty. The tasks that ap-\npear higher in the column were more diffi cult to achieve high pretest-\nposttest gain scores on than the tasks that appear lower in the column. \n Table 4.

Finally, the sixth column graphically describes the rating scale \nused to score participants\u2019 performance on the tests. \n The Rasch results for group and time\u2014the facets directly relevant \nto the research questions posed\u2014are examined in detail here. The \nsummary statistics for these facets appear in  Table 5 . Turning to a \ndescription of the results for the group facet, the gain estimates for \nthe groups spanned from \u22122.83 to 2.73 logits, which yields a logit \nspread of 5.56 logits ( SD = 2.22). The overall difference between the \ngroup estimates was signifi cant,  \u03c7 2 (4,  N = 90) = 452.00,  p < .001, with a \nseparation reliability of .99. These statistics indicate that the fi ve \ngroups\u2019 pretest-posttest gains reliably differed from each other. The \n\u2212photo recast group achieved the highest gain, followed by the +photo \nrecast group, the +photo nonrecast group, and the \u2212photo nonrecast \ngroup. As  Table 5 indicates, although the difference between the recast \ngroups\u2019 gains was relatively large, the nonrecast groups\u2019 gains differed \nonly to a small degree. The analysis yielded the lowest gain estimate \nfor the control group, which suggests that the experimental groups\u2019 \npretest-posttest gains were, at least in part, a result of their respective \ntreatments. As per the infi t statistics (which indicate the extent to \nwhich the observations fi t the modeled expectations, weighted to pro-\nvide increased value to on-target observations), the infi t mean-square \nmean was 1.83 ( SD = .46) for the facet. Hence, following Pollitt and \nHutchinson\u2019s ( 1987) criteria (i.e., two standard deviations away from \nthe mean), any value outside the range of 0.91\u22122.75 would have been \nconsidered misfi tting. All elements of the facet, however, had an infi t \nvalue inside this range. \n Table 5.

The  SD s are in parentheses. \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 461\n Moving on to the results for the time facet, the diffi culty estimate for \nthe delayed posttest was 0.17 logits, whereas the diffi culty estimate for \nthe posttest was \u22120.17 logits, with a standard deviation of 0.23 logits. \nThus, the overall diffi culty span between the posttest and delayed post-\ntest measures was relatively small (.34). The reliability of the separation \n(.82) was moderately high, and the fi xed chi-square test was signifi cant, \n \u03c7 2 (1,  N = 90) = 5.60,  p < .05. In other words, there was a signifi cant differ-\nence between participants\u2019 performance on the posttest and the de-\nlayed posttest. Specifi cally, the participants showed higher gains on the \nposttest than on the delayed posttest. Neither element of the time facet \nwas identifi ed as misfi tting or overfi tting; the infi t values for both tests \nwere within the acceptable range (Pollitt & Hutchinson,  1987 ). \n Exit Questionnaire \n In response to the question of interest here, the large majority of partici-\npants (29 of 33) reported that they found it less diffi cult to describe the \nphotos when they were able to view them. The rest of the participants \n(12.1%) felt that the availability or lack of contextual support did not make \na difference in terms of task diffi culty. It is important to note that not a \nsingle learner perceived the +photo condition as more demanding than \nthe \u2212photo condition. Most participants (72.4%) explained the lesser diffi -\nculty of the +photo condition by referring to the advantage of not having \nto remember or memorize what was in the photo. A subset of the partici-\npants also specifi ed the benefi t of not having to focus on memorization \n(51.5%). Most of these learners (42.1%) reported that when the photo was \npresent, they were able to pay greater attention to the details of the pho-\ntos and to describe all the activities portrayed, which they may not have \nbeen able to recall without having the photos in front of them. In other \nwords, these learners felt that the presence of the photo freed up atten-\ntional resources, which, in turn, enabled them to complete the task more \nsuccessfully (i.e., to describe the activities in the photos in as much detail \nas possible). Among the learners who specifi ed the benefi t for not having \nto remember the photo, a subset (9.4%) indicated that the increased at-\ntentional resources available under the +photo condition allowed them to \nfocus on how to describe what they saw in English to a greater degree; that \nis, they were able to concentrate more on how to formulate their speech. \n DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n The fi rst hypothesis posited that learners who had received recasts in \nthe absence of contextual support would show greater development in \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz462\ntheir ability to use the target feature than learners who had received \nrecasts when contextual support was available. The descriptive statis-\ntics showed a benefi t for the \u2212photo over the +photo recast treatment \non each of the three testing tasks on both posttests. The MFRM analysis \nalso found that receiving recasts in the absence of contextual support \nwas more useful in terms of L2 morphosyntactic development than re-\nceiving recasts in the presence of contextual support. Therefore, these \nresults uniformly confi rm both the fi rst hypothesis and Robinson and \nGilabert\u2019s ( 2007) prediction concerning the link between task complex-\nity and the effectiveness of recasts. \n The cognition hypothesis (Robinson,  2001 ,  2007 ) provides one possi-\nble explanation for these fi ndings. In terms of Robinson\u2019s (e.g., 2001, \n2005, 2007) taxonomy for task features, the \u2212photo condition is argu-\nably more cognitively demanding in that it exerts dual versus simple \ntask demands on learners. Therefore, the cognition hypothesis predicts \nthat increasing task complexity along this dimension will disperse at-\ntentional resources and, thus, will make the learners\u2019 task more com-\nplex, which, as a result, will induce them to look for more and more \nexternal assistance during task performance. Robinson ( 2001) implied \nthat focus-on-form techniques such as recasts, by directing learner at-\ntention to facilitative forms in the input, may be perceived by learners \nas providing such needed support. The exit questionnaire data confi rmed \nthat the \u2212photo condition was perceived as more cognitively demanding \nthan the +photo condition along the resource-dispersing dimension. \nThe majority of the participants felt that describing the photos without \ncontextual support was more diffi cult, because it forced them to simul-\ntaneously focus on speech production and memorization, which, in turn, \nmade it more challenging to concentrate on task completion. In other \nwords, as expected, learners perceived the \u2212photo condition as more \ndiffi cult than the +photo condition with respect to number of task demands \n(i.e., +\/\u2212 single task feature). Hence, Robinson\u2019s proposal (see also \n Robinson & Gilabert,  2007 ), which states that increased task demands \nalong the resource-dispersing dimension will result in greater intake \nand longer-term retention of input enhanced by recasts, appears com-\npatible with both the quantitative fi ndings and the questionnaire data. \n A second potential explanation can be derived from Wickens\u2019s ( 2007 ) \nmultiple-resource model. Given that, in terms of Wickens\u2019s model, the \ndecoding of both the photos and the recasts required the learners to \ncarry out perception tasks (i.e., processing visual and auditory input) \nas opposed to response tasks (e.g., speaking), it is possible that these \ntwo tasks entered into competition and, thus, attenuated each others\u2019 \neffects for the +photo recast group. In particular, the availability of the \nphoto, although lessening memory demands, may have simultaneously \nacted as a distracter, drawing learners\u2019 attention away from the recasts. \nFollowing this line of thought, the absence of the photo in the \u2212photo \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 463\nrecast group might have had contradictory effects on those learners\u2019 \nperformance. On the one hand, because no contextual support was \navailable for participants in this group, they did not need to handle the \npotential competition between the task of decoding recasts and that of \ndecoding visual information, an advantage over the +photo recast \ngroup. On the other hand, the unavailability of the photo is likely to \nhave dispersed the learners\u2019 attentional resources in another way, given \nthat they concurrently had to focus on the recasts and recall the visual \nprompt. This, in turn, instead of inducing increased attention to input \n(Robinson,  2001 ), might have made it less likely for learners to notice \nrecasts due to the increased demands on scheduling and task-switching \noperations. In this case, the superior pretest-posttest gains of the \n\u2212photo recast group could be taken to suggest that the positive effects \nof recasts were greater in magnitude than those afforded by the pres-\nence of a photo. Such a difference in magnitude in fact was apparent in \nthe results of the Rasch analysis; they indicated greater effects for re-\ncasts than for contextual support. \n Assuming that there was in fact a competition between the recasts \nand the visual support under the +photo recast condition, a question \narises: Why did the +photo recast group prioritize attending to the photo \nover attending to the recasts during task completion? One possible ex-\nplanation lies in the monologic, as opposed to interactive, nature of the \ntreatment task. Throughout the treatment, the participants\u2019 task was to \ndescribe the activities in the photos in as much detail as possible to the \nresearcher. In other words, the task was essentially monologic in nature; \nthe researcher was not assigned an active role during task performance. \nTherefore, there is a possibility that the learners perceived the external \nsupport offered by the photo as more relevant to task fulfi llment than \nthe external support offered by the recasts. The situation might have \nbeen different had the task required interaction between the partici-\npants and the researcher. Then the learners would, most likely, have \nbeen prompted to focus more on the recasts, as the interactive condi-\ntions afforded by the task would have necessitated attending to the \n interlocutor\u2019s speech and, hence, the feedback therein. If the present \ninterpretation proved correct, the fi ndings of this study would permit \nthe speculation that task complexity may differentially affect the effi cacy \nof recasts depending on whether the recasts are provided during mono-\nlogic or interactive task performance. If further research were to confi rm \nthis speculation, the cognition hypothesis (Robinson,  2001 ,  2007 ) might \nneed to be refi ned to accommodate the effects of interactional factors, \nsuch as monologic or interactive task conditions, in relation to the notic-\ning of, and subsequent learning induced by, interactional feedback. \n Finally, a third possible account of the fi ndings regarding task com-\nplexity and recasts is discussed. Although both the +photo and \u2212photo \nconditions were designed such that the past progressive form was \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz464\n relevant to task completion, it could be argued that the learners per-\nceived the use of past time reference as more natural in the absence of \na photo, when they had no currently shared context with the interlocu-\ntor. As a consequence, they might have been more oriented toward us-\ning the past progressive form under the \u2212photo condition, resulting in \ngreater harmony between the focus of the recasts and the subject of \ntask-induced attention. This interpretation, however, appears less plau-\nsible for two reasons. First, baseline data indicated that native speakers \nrelied on past time reference rather than present time reference when \ndescribing the photos, regardless of whether visual support was avail-\nable. Second, a post hoc analysis revealed that participants produced a \nrelatively small percentage of verbs with present tense marking in past \nprogressive contexts during the testing sessions (+photo:  M = 7.98%, \n SD = 0.18; \u2212photo:  M = 8.13%,  SD = 0.18) and treatment sessions (+photo: \n M = 8.91%,  SD = 2.17; \u2212photo:  M = 14.83%,  SD = 2.63), and such forms did \nnot occur with signifi cantly higher frequency under either of the testing \nor task conditions, as indicated by dependent and independent samples \n t tests for the testing sessions,  t (1,88) = \u22120.157,  p = .876, and the treat-\nment sessions,  t (1,70) = \u22121.04,  p = .168, respectively. Furthermore, learn-\ners often relied on past time adverbials (e.g.,  last Sunday ) while \nperforming tasks with visual support, which suggests that they were in \nthe past tense frame when talking about the photos. \n The second hypothesis predicted that learners who had performed \ntasks with contextual support but without recasts would show greater \ndevelopment in their ability to use the target feature than learners \nwho had performed tasks when neither contextual support nor recasts \nwere available. The results indicated a weak confi rmation of this hy-\npothesis. Although the descriptive statistics, overall, showed slightly \ngreater benefi ts for the \u2212photo nonrecast treatment on the posttest, \nthe +photo nonrecast treatment was found to be slightly more benefi -\ncial on the delayed posttest. The MFRM analyses conducted on the \noral and written description tasks also confi rmed a small advantage \nfor the +photo nonrecast treatment; that is, the presence of contextual \nsupport, according to the majority of the measures, facilitated these \nlearners\u2019 gains in their ability to use the past progressive form to a \nsmall degree. \n As for the specifi c trends observed in relation to task complexity, \nthe facets results for the production tasks provide support for the \npredictions derived from the cognition hypothesis (Robinson,  2001 , \n 2007 ). As predicted, decreases in task complexity along the resource-\ndispersing dimension facilitated, even if to a small extent, the partici-\npants\u2019 development in the ability to use the target form. Again, given \nRobinson\u2019s ( 2003) assumption that decreases in task complexity along \nresource-dispersing dimensions can decrease the demands imposed \non task-switching and scheduling mechanisms, it was predicted that \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 465\nsuch task manipulations would promote development in the ability to \nuse the past progressive form when tasks are suffi ciently complex \nalong resource-directing dimensions. This prediction was supported \nin the present study: Participants who performed tasks that were less \ncomplex along the resource-dispersing dimension showed slightly \ngreater overall gains. \n These results indicate that, as predicted by the cognition hypothesis \n(Robinson,  2001 ,  2007 ), task complexity can affect L2 learning outcomes. \nNevertheless, the effects found for task complexity, again, were rather \nsmall, especially in comparison to the relatively large impact detected \nfor the combined effects of recasts and task complexity. This discrep-\nancy between the effect sizes may have been an artifact of the design \nused here. Arguably, the \u2212photo and +photo conditions, as operational-\nized here, were not markedly different from each other. It is worth not-\ning, however, that the study by Nuevo ( 2006) , the most robust study \nthat has previously attempted to investigate task complexity in relation \nto the learning of specifi c L2 features, yielded no signifi cant effect at all \nfor task complexity. Hence, it is also possible that task features, in and \nof themselves, without being combined with some type of external in-\ntervention, may only have a limited impact on L2 learning. One reason \nmay be that whereas task-based production clearly has the capacity to \npromote greater control and automatized access to L2 forms, it is less \nlikely to assist in the acquisition of new features or in triggering restruc-\nturing (Ellis,  2003 ). By implication, even if task complexity were to mod-\nulate the link between task-based production and L2 learning, it would \nonly be expected to have a narrow effect, given the already limited po-\ntential of task-based production to lead to L2 development. Clearly, fu-\nture studies are necessary to clarify the nature of the relationships \namong task complexity, production, and L2 learning. \n LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH \n There are a number of limitations to this study that need to be acknowl-\nedged and considered in future research. First, a major weakness resides \nin the fact that recasts were treated as a constant. Although care was \ntaken to provide recasts that were of the isolated declarative type and \ncontained no added emphasis, factors such as length, single versus mul-\ntiple corrections, and partial versus full reformulation were not held con-\nstant, all of which have been shown to have the capacity to modulate the \neffective functioning of oral feedback techniques (e.g., Loewen & Philp, \n 2006 ; Philp,  2003 ). A follow-up study could examine whether any of these \nfactors did indeed have an impact on the effi cacy of recasts. \n Second, learner responses to recasts were not considered in the \n present analysis, and, given that modified output (e.g., Loewen, \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz466\n 2005 ; McDonough,  2005 ; Swain,  1995 ) as well as primed production \n(McDonough & Mackey,  2006 ) have been argued to positively affect L2 \nlearning, a potential difference in the quantity and quality of the two \nrecast groups\u2019 responses to feedback might have modulated the results. \nA follow-up study could assess whether modifi ed output or primed pro-\nduction, or both, actually had an effect on the results obtained. \n Third, the present research only investigated the effects of task com-\nplexity and its combination with recasts on a single linguistic feature\u2014\nthe past progressive form in English; thus, the results may not generalize \nto other structures or languages. A replication of this study with fea-\ntures of low, as opposed to high, physical salience or communicative \nvalue, or both, would be especially desirable, given that structures with \nsuch characteristics are the least likely to be noticed and, thus, learned \nsolely from exposure to input (e.g., Long & Robinson,  1998 ). \n Fourth, the treatment primarily elicited obligatory contexts for only \none usage linked to the past progressive and supplied a limited number \nof contexts for other usages associated with this form. Hence, the treat-\nment may have provided learners with a biased representation of the \nform-meaning mappings associated with the past progressive marking, \nwhich reinforced the general tendency of L2 learners to assume one-to-\none correspondence between forms and meanings. A related limitation \nwas that the assessments did not allow for testing how this restricted \nfocus affected the acquisition of the additional meanings of the past \nprogressive, given that the testing tasks mainly focused on a single \nmeaning (i.e., the same usage of the target form). \n Fifth, the exit questionnaire data, due to the inherent nature of the \nmethodology, could only provide information on conscious processes. \nAs a result, the exclusive use of this method to tap into the learners\u2019 \nperceptions limited the theoretical insights that could be gained regard-\ning the cognition hypothesis, which puts heavy emphasis on constructs \nsuch as deep processing and automatic recognition processes in short-\nterm memory\u2014phenomena not available to conscious awareness. Fu-\nture research, therefore, should circumvent this shortcoming by \nincluding implicit memory tasks in addition to protocols that tap ex-\nplicit memory processes. \n Follow-up studies that investigate the combined effects of recasts \nand task complexity as a function of individual difference variables are \nalso warranted. As suggested by many, learner factors such as apti-\ntude, motivation, and working memory, to name just a few, may signifi -\ncantly moderate the effects of task complexity and recasts on various \naspects of L2 development (e.g., Mackey et al.,  2002 ; Robinson,  2005 ; \nTrofi movich, Ammar, & Gatbonton,  2007 ). In the current study, differ-\nences in participants\u2019 working memory capacity may have played an \nimportant role given that the \u2212photo condition required considerable \nmemorization on the part of learners. Moreover, working memory has \nTask Complexity, Focus on Form, and L2 Development 467\nbeen shown to be a signifi cant predictor of learner noticing of recasts \n(Mackey et al.). \n Another important avenue for future research would involve extend-\ning the research questions posed here to other tasks, conditions, and \ncontexts. The present study included a single task type that involved \nlearners in a monologic task in the context of individualized sessions. It \nis not necessarily the case that the effects found here would transfer to \ndifferent task types, distinct interactive conditions, or classroom set-\ntings where learners typically receive less attention from the teacher. \n Finally, in addition to continued efforts to investigate the interaction \nbetween task variables and the effi cacy of recasts, future research \nshould aim to explore the relationship between additional focus-\non-form techniques and task complexity. This line of research could \nhave important pedagogical implications: For instance, it might provide \nL2 educators with insight on how to design pedagogic tasks in order to \nenhance the effectiveness of focus-on-form interventions. \n (Received 17 September 2008) \n NOTES \n 1.  Note that the terms  acquisition ,  development , and  learning are used interchangeably \nhere. \n 2.  Robinson ( 2003) acknowledged that such interference between L1 and L2 codes \nmay be induced by task demands. In fact, using the competition model as a framework \n(e.g., MacWhinney,  2001 ), he implied that the presence and magnitude of such interfer-\nence will depend on the extent to which the two languages differ in their relevant cues. \n 3.  Of course, following Robinson ( 2003) , it is also possible that decreasing task com-\nplexity along resource-dispersing dimensions will free up attentional resources in a different \nresource pool, but this is not necessarily the case. For example, allowing for planning time \nis, at least in part, likely to decrease attentional demands on the verbal resource pool. \n 4.  With reference to storytelling tasks, Robinson ( 1995) also explained that whereas a \ncontext-supported condition only requires the speakers to describe episodes happening \nbefore their eyes, a context-unsupported condition involves the retrieval of stored events. \n 5.  It might be argued that it is more natural to narrate in the present tense under the \n+contextual support condition. However, there is empirical evidence that showed that \nlearners can be prompted to use past time reference when describing events even if con-\ntextual support is available (e.g., Han,  2002 ). \n 6.  The rationale for administering either the delayed posttest or the exit question-\nnaire, but not both, to the participants was that completing the questionnaire prior to the \ndelayed posttest might have raised learners\u2019 awareness of the purpose of this study. \nAlternatively, if the questionnaire had been performed after the delayed posttest, the long \ntime interval between the treatment and the delayed posttest might have resulted in \nmemory decay on the part of learners, threatening the validity of the questionnaire data. \n 7.  Average measures are defi ned as the average of the logit estimates for all partici-\npants in the sample who produced a particular score, whereas  step calibrations are the \ndiffi culties estimated for achieving a particular test score over another. Both measures \nare expected to increase monotonically as a variable increases in size; disordered average \nmeasures and step calibrations suggest that a certain rating scale does not adequately \nrepresent the data. \nAndrea R\u00e9v\u00e9sz468\n 8.  An anonymous  SSLA reviewer raised the issue of whether the +photo group re-\nceived more recasts because they produced more language. This question would warrant \nan investigation in a follow-up analysis. \n REFERENCES \n Bardovi-Harlig ,  K . ( 2000 ).  Tense and aspect in second language acquisition: Form, meaning, \nand use .
