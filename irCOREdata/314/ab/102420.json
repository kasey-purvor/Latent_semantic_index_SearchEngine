INTRODUCTION\nThe support weight distribution (SWD) of linear codes was intro-\nduced by Helleseth, Kl\u00f8ve, and Mykkeltveit [1]. From the SWD of a\nsingle code, they were able to determine the weight distribution of a\ncorresponding in\ufb01nite class of codes. After the introduction of the re-\nlated weight hierarchy in [2], this problem received renewed interest,\nand in recent years, the SWD\u2019s of particular codes [3], [4] and dual\ncodes [5]\u2013[7] have been studied. In this correspondence, we give a short\nand simple calculation of the second SWD of the Kasami codes.\nII. PRELIMINARIES\nLet (q) be the \ufb01nite \ufb01eld of q elements and (q)n a vector space\nof dimension n with a \ufb01xed coordinate basis. An [n; k] code C over\n(q) is a k-dimensional subspace of (q)n. For any vector x 2\n(q), the support \u001f(x) is de\ufb01ned as the set of coordinate positions\nwhere x is nonzero. For a subset S \u0012 (q)n, the support \u001f(S) is the\nunion of supports of the members of S. The weight w(x) or w(S) of\nan element or a set is the cardinality of its support.\nThe weight hierarchy of a code C is the sequence (d1; . . . ; dk),\nwhere dr is the smallest weight of any r-dimensional subcode of C .\nThe support weight distribution of C is the array of parameters Ari\nwhere 0 \u0014 i \u0014 n and 0 \u0014 r \u0014 k, de\ufb01ned as the number of r-dimen-\nsional subcodes of C with weight i.\nLet Tm denote the Froebenius trace from (qm) to (q), de\ufb01ned\nas\nTm(x) =\nm\u00001\ni=0\nxq :\nIt is well known that\nTm(x+ y) =Tm(x) + Tm(y)\nTm(x) =Tm(x\nq)\nand if x runs through (qm), then Tm(x) takes each value in (q)\nexactly qm\u00001 times. The original Kasami code is a binary code, so\nthroughout the correspondence, we let q = 2 and writeQ = 2m. Thus,\nTm : (Q)! (2) and T2m : (Q2)!

For each nonzero\nvalue of aQ+1, there are (22m \u0000 1)=(2m \u0000 1) = 2m + 1 choices for\na. Hence, the number of codewords c(a; b) for b \ufb01xed of minimum and\nmaximum weight are determined by\n#fa : Tm(a\nQ+1) = 1g =(2m + 1) \u0001 2m\u00001\n#fa : Tm(a\nQ+1) = 0g =(2m + 1) \u0001 (2m\u00001 \u0000 1) + 1\n=2m\u00001(2m \u0000 1):\nThe weight hierarchy of Km was studied in [8], and we will need\nseveral lemmas therefrom.

If f(\r; a) 6= 0 and Tm(\rQ+1) = 0,\nthen the coset V\r + c(a; 0) contains 2m\u00001 \u0000 1 words of weight m1,\n2m\u00001 words of weight d1, and one word of weight w1.\nThis lemma is analogous to [8, Lemma 7(ii)], but assuming\nTm(\r\nQ+1) = 0 instead of equal to one.\nLemma 4: If Tm(\rQ+1) = 0, then f(\r; a) 6= 0 for all a 6= 0.\nProof: Clearly, the only solution of f(a; \r) = 0 when \r = 0 is\na = 0, so suppose \r 6= 0 for the rest of the proof. Suppose there is\nnonzero a 2 (Q2) such that f(\r; a) = 0. Then\n\r2a2(Q\u00001) + \r2Q + aQ\u00001 = 0; aQ \u00001 = 1\nand writing z = aQ\u00001, z we get that\n\r2z2 + z + \r2Q = 0; zQ+1 = 1: (1)\nSetting u = \r2z and multiplying by \r2, we get that (1) is equivalent\nto\nu2 + u+ \r2(Q+1) = 0; uQ+1 = \r2(Q+1): (2)\n0018-9448\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, VOL. 51, NO. 8, AUGUST 2005 2893\nTABLE I\nTHE SECOND SWD OF THE KASAMI CODES\nSet b = \r2(Q+1). From (2), we get that u2 = u + b, which is, by\nrepeated squaring and multiplication by u, equivalent to\nu2 +1 = u2 + Tm(b)u\nwhich is equal to \r2(Q+1) if and only if Tm(b) = 1 by Lemma 2. This\nproves the lemma.\nIII. SECOND SUPPORT WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION\nConsider the two-dimensional subcodes of Km. There are essen-\ntially eight types of such subcodes, which we denote by the weights of\nthe three nonzero words as follows: w:w:w, w:d:d, w:d:m, w:m:m,\nd:d:d, d:d:m, d:m:m, andm:m:m. Let Bx:x:x denote the number of\nsubcodes of type x:x:x, and let A2i be the number of two-dimensional\nsubcodes of weight i. We distinguish four different cases. Let Byx:x:x\ndenote the number of subcodes of type x:x:x resulting from case y.\nLetD = ha; bi be a two-dimensional subcode, where a = c(a1; b1)\nand b = c(a2; b2) and a + b = c(a3; b3). Recall that a3 = a1 + a2\nand b3 = b1 + b2.\nCase 1: b1 = b2 = b3 = 0.\nThe words of weight 2m\u00001 are c(a; 0)where a 6=0. So ifD has three\nwords of weight 2m\u00001 it must be one of the (22m\u00001)(22m\u00001\u00001)=3\ntwo-dimensional subcodes contained in fc(a; 0) : a2 (22m)g\nB1w:w:w = (2\n2m \u0000 1)(22m\u00001 \u0000 1)=3:\nCase 2: b1 = b2 6= 0, b3 = 0.\nThere are 2m \u0000 1 choices for b1. We have three possibilities, 1)\nw(a) = w(b) = d1, 2) w(a) = w(b) = m1, and 3) w(a) = d1\nwhereas w(b) = m1. For 1) and 2), a and b may be interchanged, so\neach possibility is counted twice. The number of a values giving each\nweight is found by Remark 1\nB2w:d:d =2\nm\u00002(2m \u0000 1)(2m + 1)((2m + 1)2m\u00001 \u0000 1)\nB2w:d:m =2\n2m\u00002(22m \u0000 1)(2m \u0000 1)\nB2w:m:m =2\nm\u00002(2m \u0000 1)2(2m + 1)(2m\u00001 \u0000 1):\nCases 3\u20134: b1; b2; b3 distinct.\nDe\ufb01ne \ri = ai=\np\nbi. Observe that\np\nb3 =\np\nb1 +\np\nb2, because\n(x+ y)2 = x2+ y2 in characteristic 2. It follows that if \r1 = \r2, then\na3 = \r3\np\nb3 = \r1(\np\nb1 +\np\nb2) = \r1\np\nb3\nso \r3 = \r1 as well.\nCase 3: \r1 = \r2 = \r3.\nIn this case, D \u0012 V\r . So either D has three words of weight m1\nor three of weight d1. There are (2m\u0000 1)(2m\u00001\u0000 1)=3 possible two-\ndimensional subcodes for each choice of \r1; and the number of \r1\nvalues for each weight is found in Remark 1\nB3d:d:d =\n(2m \u0000 1)(2m\u00001 \u0000 1)\n3\n2m\u00001(2m + 1)\nB3m:m:m =\n(2m \u0000 1)(2m\u00001 \u0000 1)\n3\n2m\u00001(2m \u0000 1):\nCase 4: Distinct \r1; \r2; \r3.\nIn this case, there is an a0 2 (Q2) such that\nc(a1; b1) 2V\r + c(a0; 0)\nc(a2; b2) 2V\r + c(a0; 0)\nc(a3; b3) 2V\r :\nThe subcode D is chosen by the following procedure.\n1. Choose \r3. There are 22m possibilities.\n2. Choose a0 6= 0. There are 22m \u0000 1 possibilities.\n3. Choose an unordered pair of points b1; b2 2 (Q)\u0003, which\nde\ufb01nes uniquely a pair of distinct points in V\r +c(a0; 0). There\nare (2m \u0000 1)(2m\u00001 \u0000 1) possibilities.\nConsider the case where Tm(\rQ+13 ) = 0, which implies that\nw(c(a3; b3)) = m1. By Remark 1, there are (2m \u0000 1)2m\u00001 appro-\npriate choices of \r3. By Lemmas 3 and 4, for any a0 6= 0,V\r +c(a0; 0)\nhas 2m\u00001 \u0000 1 words of weight d1 and 2m\u00001 words of weight m1.\nThus, there are 22m\u00002 \u0000 2m\u00001 pairs (b1; b2) giving one word of\nweight d1 and one of weight m1. There are (2m\u00001 \u0000 1)(2m\u00002 \u0000 1)\npairs where both words have weight d1, and 2m\u00002(2m\u00001 \u0000 1) where\nboth have weight m1. Each subcode has been counted once for each\nmaximum weight word it contains, since any such word may be\nc(a3; b3). Thus, we get\nB4d:d:m =2\nm\u00001(2m \u0000 1)(22m \u0000 1)(2m\u00001 \u0000 1)2m\u00002\nB4d:m:m =2\nm\u00001(2m \u0000 1)(22m \u0000 1)2m\u00001(2m\u00001 \u0000 1)=2\nB4m:m:m =\n2m\u00001(2m \u0000 1)(22m \u0000 1)(2m\u00001 \u0000 1)(2m\u00002 \u0000 1)\n3\n:\nThe number of subcodes with three words of weight d1 is computed\nas\nB4d:d:d = T \u0000B4d:d:m \u0000B4d:m:m \u0000B4m:m:m\nwhere T is the number of words for Case 4, i.e.,\nT = (24m \u0000 22m)(2m \u0000 1)(2m\u00001 \u0000 1)=3:\nThis gives us\nB4d:d:d =\n(22m \u0000 1)(2m \u0000 1)(2m\u00001 \u0000 1)\n3\n\u0001 (22m \u0000 2m\u00001(7 \u0001 2m\u00002 \u0000 1)):\nTo \ufb01nd the weight for each subcode type, and thereby to \ufb01nd the SWD,\nwe need the following lemma.\nLemma 5 ([8]): LetD be an r-dimensional subcode of C . Then\nw(D) =\n1\n2r\u00001\nc2D\nw(c):\nObserve that types w1:w1:w1 and w1:d1:m1 have the same support\nweight, whereas the other types have distinct weights. Adding the dif-\nferent cases, we obtain the following theorem.\n2894 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, VOL. 51, NO. 8, AUGUST 2005\nTABLE II\nTHE SECOND SWD FOR SOME SMALL KASAMI CODES\nTheorem 1: The second support weight distribution of the [22m \u0000\n1; 3m; 22m\u00001 \u0000 2m\u00001] Kasami code is given by the expressions in\nTable I.\nWe have veri\ufb01ed the second SWD for some small Kasami codes by\ncomputer, and these numbers are shown in Table II.\nIt appears to be more dif\ufb01cult to determine higher order support\nweight distributions completely. The most dif\ufb01cult case is probably\nwhen all the \ri are distinct. For instance, studying a three-dimensional\nsubcode, we have one nonzero word in V\r and two words in each of\nthree cosets V\r + c(a1; 0), V\r + c(a2; 0), and V\r + c(a1 + a2; 0).\nSince only three out of the six coset points may be chosen freely, it is\nnot obvious how to divine the weights of the remaining three.

Since the parity-check\nmatrix of a QC-LDPC code consists of circulant permutation matrices or\nthe zero matrix, the required memory for storing it can be signi\ufb01cantly\nreduced, as compared with randomly constructed LDPC codes. We show\nthat the girth of a QC-LDPC code is upper-bounded by a certain number\nwhich is determined by the positions of circulant permutation matrices.\nThe B-LDPC codes are constructed as irregular QC-LDPC codes with\nparity-check matrices of an almost lower triangular form so that they\nhave an ef\ufb01cient encoding algorithm, good noise threshold, and low error\n\ufb02oor. Their encoding complexity is linearly scaled regardless of the size of\ncirculant permutation matrices.\nIndex Terms\u2014Block cycle, circulant permutation matrix, ef\ufb01cient en-\ncoding, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, quasi-cyclic codes.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nLow-density parity-check (LDPC) codes\u2014\ufb01rst discovered by Gal-\nlager [7] and rediscovered by Sipser et al. [13] and MacKay et al. [10],\n[11]\u2014havecreatedmuch interest recently since they are shown tohave a\nremarkable performance close to the Shannon limit over additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) channels [14]. LDPC codes possess many ad-\nvantages including parallelizable decoding, self-error-detection capa-\nbility by syndrome check, an asymptotically better performance than\nturbo codes, etc. Many coding theorists have brought new develop-\nments in the construction and decoding schemes of LDPC codes with\nlow complexity for their commercial use in the past few years.\nRichardson et al. introduced a method to design LDPC codes that\nperform extremely close to the Shannon capacity for suf\ufb01ciently large\ncode length under the assumption of no cycles [14]. They computed\nthe threshold of noise level for a large class of binary-input channels\nby density evolution, and presented some simulation results for proving\ntheir claims. Here, the threshold of noise level means the maximum\nnoise level to obtain the zero error probability as the block length tends\nto in\ufb01nity. To \ufb01nd an ensemble which has larger threshold than that\nof the conventional ensemble of LDPC codes, Kasai et al. introduced\ndetailedly represented irregular LDPC codes [8] and Richardson and\nUrbanke introduced multi-edge type LDPC codes [16]. They are ob-\ntained by representing the degree distribution according to the type of\nthe edges.\nDensity evolution is a useful tool to obtain the asymptotical per-\nformance of LDPC codes, but not to estimate their performance in\nthe case of \ufb01nite length. In other words, it is not guaranteed that \ufb01-\nnite-length LDPC codes with degree distribution suggested by density\nevolution have good performance.
