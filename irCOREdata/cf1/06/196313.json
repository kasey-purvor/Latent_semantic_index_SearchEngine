Our results reveal a new\nrobust antiparallel G-quadruplex fold involving two\nG-tetrads sandwiched between a G.C base pair\nand a G.C.G.C tetrad, which could represent a\nnew platform for drug design targeted to human\ntelomeric DNA.\nINTRODUCTION\nTelomeres, the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes,\nconsist of tandem repeats of G-rich sequences (1).\nActing as the protective caps of the chromosomes,\ntelomeres are critical for chromosomal stability, cell sur-\nvival and proliferation (2). Human telomeres encompass\nthousands of canonical (wild-type) TTAGGG repeats (3),\nwhich can be interspersed with some sequence-variant\nrepeats (4,5). It has been reported [see accompanying\npaper (6)] that a particular repeat type, CTAGGG\n(variation is underlined), when present as a short contig-\nuous array within the telomere, causes an extraordinarily\nhigh level of localized telomere instability in the male\ngermline and somatic cells. These variant repeats also\nbind to the telomeric factor POT1 more efficiently than\nTTAGGG repeats (6). Thus, it is important to understand\nif unusual structures are formed by these sequence-variant\nrepeats, as they could lead to incongruities during\ntelomere replication, contributing to the instability of the\ntelomere.\nPrevious studies have established that human telomeric\nDNA sequences containing four canonical TTAGGG\nrepeats can adopt at least five different G-quadruplex\nstructures under different experimental conditions\n(7\u201329). These include three conformations observed in\nK+ solution (Supplementary Figure S1): the sequences\nd[TAGGG(TTAGGG)3] and d[TAGGG(TTAGGG)3\nTT] form predominantly intramolecular three-G-tetrad\n(3+1) G-quadruplexes Form 1 (21\u201326,28) and Form 2\n(24,27,28), respectively, while the sequence d[GGG(TTA\nGGG)3T] forms mainly an intramolecular basket-type\nG-quadruplex involving only two G-tetrads, designated\nas Form 3 (29). Here, we report on the structure of an\nintramolecular G-quadruplex formed by DNA sequences\ncontaining four human telomeric variant CTAGGG\nrepeats in K+ solution. Our results reveal a new robust\nantiparallel G-quadruplex fold involving two G-tetrads,\na G.C base pair and a G.C.G.C tetrad, which could\nserve as a new platform for drug design targeted to\nhuman telomeric DNA.\nMETHODS\nDNA sample preparation\nUnlabeled and site-specific labeled DNA oligonucleotides\n(Table 1; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) were chemi-\ncally synthesized on an ABI 394 DNA\/RNA synthesizer\nor purchased from Eurogentec (Belgium). DNA concen-\ntration was expressed in strand molarity using a nearest-\nneighbor approximation for the absorption coefficients of\nthe unfolded species (30).\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

DNA samples (32P-labeled) of three different total\nconcentrations (0.05, 4 and 80 mM) were incubated in a\n10mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.5 buffer supplemented with\n100mM NaCl or KCl. They were heated at 908C for\n5min and slowly cooled down (over 2 h) to 208C. The\nsamples were loaded on a 15% polyacrylamide gel\nsupplemented with 20mM of the corresponding salt and\nrun at 268C; 10% sucrose was added just before loading.\nUV-melting experiments\nThe thermal stability of different oligonucleotides\nwas characterized in heating\/cooling experiments by\nrecording the UV absorbance at 295 nm as a function of\ntemperature (32) using a Kontron-Uvikon 940 UV\/Vis\nspectrophotometer. UV-melting experiments were con-\nducted as previously described (33) in a 10mM lithium\ncacodylate pH 7.2 buffer containing 100mM NaCl or\nKCl. The heating and cooling rates were 0.28C per\nminute. Experiments were performed with 1-cm\npathlength quartz cuvettes.\nThermal difference spectra\nThe thermal difference spectra (TDS) of a nucleic acid\nwere obtained by recording the UV absorbance spectra\nover a range of temperatures (20\u2013908C) and subsequently\ntaking the difference between each spectrum and that at\n908C. TDS provide specific signatures of different DNA\nand RNA structural conformations (34). Spectra were\nrecorded between 220 and 320 nm on a Kontron-Uvikon\n940 UV\/Vis spectrophotometer using quartz cuvettes\nwith an optical pathlength of 1 cm. DNA concentration\nwas 4 mM.\nCircular dichroism\nCircular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a\nJASCO-810 spectropolarimeter using a 1-cm pathlength\nquartz cuvette with a reaction volume of 600 ml. The\nDNA oligonucleotides (4 mM) were prepared in a 10mM\nlithium cacodylate pH 7.2 buffer containing 100mMNaCl\nor KCl. The samples were heated at 908C for 5min and\ncooled down to room temperature overnight. For each\nsample, an average of three scans was taken, the spectrum\nof the buffer was subtracted, and the data were zero-\ncorrected at 320 nm.\nCalorimetry\nMicrocalorimetry experiments were performed on a Nano\nDSC-II microcalorimeter as previously described (35). The\noligonucleotides were prepared at concentrations rang-\ning from 194 to 223 mM in a 10mM lithium cacodylate\npH 7.2 buffer containing 100mM KCl. An average of\nsix differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) heating and\ncooling profiles was taken.\nNMR spectroscopy\nSamples for NMR study were dialyzed successively against\n\u000250mMKCl solution and against water. Unless otherwise\nstated, the strand concentration of the NMR samples was\ntypically 0.5\u20132.0mM; the solutions contained 70mM KCl\nand 20mM potassium phosphate (pH 7). NMR exper-\niments were performed on 600MHz and 700MHz Bruker\nspectrometers at 258C, unless otherwise specified. Reso-\nnances for guanine residues were assigned unambiguously\nby using site-specific low-enrichment 15N labeling (36), site-\nspecific 2H labeling (37), and through-bond correlations at\nnatural abundance (38,39). Resonances for thymine\nresidues were assigned following systematic T-to-U\nsubstitutions. Spectral assignments were completed by\nNOESY, COSY, TOCSY, {13C-1H}-HMBC and\n{13C-1H}-HSQC, as previously described (29,39). Inter-\nproton distances were deduced from NOESY experiments\nat various mixing times. All spectral analyses were\nperformed using the FELIX (Felix NMR, Inc.) program.\nStructure calculation\nInter-proton distances for the d[AGGG(CTAGGG)3]\nquadruplex were deduced from NOESY experiments\nperformed in H2O (mixing time, 200ms) and D2O\n(mixing times, 100, 200 and 350ms). Structure\ncomputations were performed using the XPLOR-NIH\nprogram (40) in three general steps essentially as pre-\nviously described (29): (i) distance geometry simulated\nannealing, (ii) distance-restrained molecular dynamics\nrefinement and (iii) relaxation matrix intensity refinement.\nHydrogen bond restraints, inter-proton distance res-\ntraints, dihedral restraints, planarity restraints and repul-\nsive restraints were imposed during structure calculations.\nStructures were displayed using the PyMOL program (41).\nData deposition\nThe coordinates for the d[AGGG(CTAGGG)3] quad-\nruplex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank\n(accession code 2KM3).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nSequences containing four human telomeric variant\nCTAGGG repeats form a new G-quadruplex\nfold in K+ solution\nThe imino proton spectrum of the 22-nt human telomeric\nvariant d[AGGG(CTAGGG)3] sequence, henceforth des-\nignated as 22CTA (Table 1), in K+ solution (Figure 1) was\ndistinct from those observed for the canonical four-repeat\nTTAGGG human telomeric sequences (22\u201329) and\nindicated the formation of a new G-quadruplex structure:\neight major peaks at 10.8\u201311.9 p.p.m. corresponded to the\nformation of two G-tetrads and three major peaks at\n12.8-13.4 p.p.m. corresponded to three Watson\u2013Crick\nG.C base pairs (see below). The eight former peaks\nremained sharp at 458C (Supplementary Figure S2),\nconsistent with their G-tetrad origin (29). Minor\nG-quadruplex form(s) were also present in 22CTA, as\nshown by minor peaks at 10.6\u201312.2 p.p.m., whose relative\n6240 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 18\n at Leicester University Library on Septem\nber 14, 2010\nn\na\nr.o\nxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \npopulation (as compared to the major form) augmented\nwhen the temperature was increased (Supplementary\nFigure S2). Imino proton spectra (Supplementary\nFigure S3) of many different sequences containing four\nhuman telomeric variant CTAGGG repeats with different\nflanking ends (Supplementary Table S1) showed eight\nmajor peaks at 10.8\u201311.9 p.p.m. along with major peaks\nat 12.8\u201313.6 p.p.m., suggesting that they also adopted pre-\ndominantly a G-quadruplex containing Watson\u2013Crick\nG.C base pairs in K+ solution. A preliminary analysis\non a NOESY spectrum of the 23CTA sequence (Table 1)\nsuggested that this sequence adopted in K+ solution the\nsame overall G-quadruplex fold as 22CTA (see below).\nThe imino proton spectrum of 22CTA in Na+ solution\n(Supplementary Figure S4) indicated the presence of a\nmajor G-quadruplex form and minor conformation(s),\nbut major sharp peaks around 13 p.p.m. (characteristic of\nstable Watson\u2013Crick G.C base pairs) were not observed.\nNative gel electrophoresis analysis\nThe molecular size of G-quadruplexes formed by variant\nhuman telomeric sequences (Table 1) was probed by\nnative PAGE. In both Na+ and K+ solution, a single\nmajor band was observed for each of the 22-nt human\ntelomeric sequences (Figure 2), 22wt (containing TTAG\nGG repeats), 22CTA (containing CTAGGG repeats)\nand 22TCA (containing TCAGGG repeats). The rate of\nmigration of the band was independent of oligonucleotide\nconcentrations (from 0.05 to 80 mM), arguing for an\nintramolecular structure for each of the three sequences.\nThis was further substantiated by the fast migration of the\nband in relation to those of duplexes (9 and 12 bp),\noligothymidylate sequences (15, 21 and 30 nt), and a\n22-nt control sequence (22AgMut4) incapable of forming\na quadruplex.\nThermal stability: UV absorption and calorimetry studies\nMelting experiments were conducted for variant human\ntelomeric sequences by monitoring the UV absorbance\nat 295 nm (32). All transitions were reversible, indi-\ncating that the denaturation curves corresponded to\na true equilibrium process (Supplementary Figure S5).\nFigure 2. Non-denaturing PAGE analysis of the 22wt, 22CTA and\n22TCA human telomeric sequences (Table 1), which were pre-incubated\nin a 10mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.5 buffer supplemented with (A) 100mM\nNa+ or (B) 100mM K+, then loaded on a 15% polyacrylamide gel\nsupplemented with 20mM of the corresponding salt, and run at 268C.\nMigration markers are provided on the left: oligothymidylate sequences\n(dT15, dT21 and dT30), duplexes (dx9: d[GCGATACGG] + d[CCGTA\nTCGC] and dx12: d[GCGTGACTTCGG]+d[CCGAAGTCACGC]),\nand single-stranded 22AgMut4 control sequence d[ATGGTTAGTGT\nTAGGTTTAGTG] incapable of forming a quadruplex. Note that\nwith respect to the markers, 22wt, 22CTA and 22TCA human telomeric\nsequences migrate faster in K+ solution than in Na+ solution.\nFigure 1.

No significant difference (18C or less) in\nmelting temperature was observed upon about 40-fold\nincrease in concentration (from 5 to \u0002200mM), indicating\nthat the G-quadruplex folding was indeed intramolecular.\nThe variant 22CTA sequence was found to be marginally\nless stable than the canonical 22wt sequence in 20 and\n100mM KCl (Table 2 and data not shown). The stability\nof both 22CTA and 22wt was lower in NaCl than in KCl\n(data not shown), as usually observed for the formation of\nG-quadruplexes. Note that the 23-nt human telomeric\nvariant sequence 23CTA was slightly more stable than\n22CTA. Thermodynamic parameters of the variant\nhuman telomeric sequences in K+ solution, extracted\nfrom the UV-melting experiments (32), are listed in\nTable 2.\nMicrocalorimetry experiments (35) were performed on\nthe same set of oligonucleotides in a buffer containing\n100mM KCl (Supplementary Figure S6). Analysis\nof DSC scans confirmed that 22CTA was slightly less\nstable than 22wt. Both transitions gave similar enthalpy\nvalues (\u000240 kcal\/mol, determined using a calorimetry\nmodel-independent analysis, as compared to \u000250 kcal\/\nmol, with a van t\u2019 Hoff analysis; Table 2). A similar dif-\nference in enthalpy has been reported for the wild-type\nsequence (42).\nTDS and CD signatures\nThe TDS for both 22CTA and 22wt in K+ solution\n(Figure 3A and B; Supplementary Figure S7) exhibited\ntypical patterns of a G-quadruplex structure, with two\npositive maxima at 240 and 275 nm and a negative mini-\nmum around 295 nm (34). There was an isosbestic point\nfor both sequences around 285 nm, but the shapes of the\ntwo TDS differed around 255 nm.\nCD spectra for both sequences in K+ solution\n(Figure 3C and D; Supplementary Figure S8) were in\nagreement with the formation of G-quadruplexes.\nThe CD profile of 22CTA (with a very negative peak\naround 260 nm) differed significantly from that of the\nwild-type sequence 22wt, consistent with the formation of\na different fold.\nNMR spectral assignments\nGuanine imino and H8 protons of 22CTA were unambig-\nuously assigned using site-specific low-enrichment\n15N labeling (36), site-specific 2H labeling (37) and\nthrough-bond correlations at natural abundance (38,39)\n(Figure 4; Supplementary Table S2). Resonances for\nthymine residues were unambiguously assigned by T-to-\nU substitutions (39) (Supplementary Figure S9 and\nTable S2). With the help of these unambiguous assign-\nments and other through-bond correlation experiments\n(COSY, TOCSY, {13C-1H}-HMBC and {13C-1H}-\nHSQC) (data not shown), the classical H8\/H6-H1\u2019 NOE\nsequential connectivity could be traced from A1 through\nG22 (Figure 5). The intensity of intraresidue H8-H1\u2019 NOE\ncross-peaks (Supplementary Figure S10) indicated\nsyn glycosidic conformation for G3, G9, G15 and G21,\nin contrast to other residues, which adopted anti\nconformation. These results were supported by NMR\nspectra of modified sequences in which G3, G9, G15\nand G21 were substituted by 8-bromoguanine (BrG)\n(Supplementary Figure S11 and data not shown).\n22CTA forms a chair-type G-quadruplex containing a\nG.C.G.C tetrad\nAnalysis of imino-H8 connectivity patterns (Figure 6A)\nrevealed the formation of an intramolecular chair-\ntype G-quadruplex with two G-tetrad layers, G4.G21.\nG16.G9 and G3.G10.G15.G22 (Figure 6B and D): the\nhydrogen-bond directionalities of the G-tetrads alternate\nanticlockwise and clockwise; the glycosidic conformations\nof guanines around each tetrad are syn.anti.syn.anti;\neach strand is antiparallel to the two adjacent strands;\nthere are two narrow and two wide grooves; the three\nconnecting loops are edgewise; the first and third\nloops (on the top) span narrow grooves, while the\nsecond loop (at the bottom) spans a wide groove.

This placement was supported by the observations\nof a number of NOE cross-peaks [e.g. a NOE between\nthe imino protons of G14 and G10 (data not shown)\nand NOEs between the protons of C11 and the bottom\nG-tetrad (Figure 6A)] and the results from solvent\nexchange experiment showing that the imino proton of\nG10 was better protected than that of the three other\nguanines (G3, G15 and G21) from the same G-tetrad\n(Supplementary Figure S12). At the bottom loop, the\nA13 base stacks underneath the G14.C11 base pair,\nwhile the T12 base folds into a hydrophobic groove (29).\nThe 22CTA G-quadruplex represents a robust fold\nThe structure of 22CTA in K+ solution consists of a\ntwo-G-tetrad antiparallel core sandwiched between a\nG.C base pair and a G.C.G.C tetrad. This robust fold\nappeared to be the preferred one for various four-repeat\nvariant CTAGGG sequences with different flanking ends\nin K+ solution, contrasting the situation of sequences\ncontaining four canonical TTAGGG repeats, which\nwere shown to adopt different G-quadruplex folds\n(7\u201329). Our modeling and preliminary NMR spectral\nanalysis (including NOESY) suggested that sequences\ncontaining an additional C at the 30-end (e.g. 23CTA)\ncould form a similar G-quadruplex with a second\nG.C.G.C tetrad at the bottom of the structure. The\nformation of the G14.C11.G2.C23 tetrad for 23CTA\nwould be consistent with its higher stability (Table 2)\nand considerable changes in the chemical shifts of G3\nand G15 imino protons of the bottom G-tetrad\n(Supplementary Figure S3) as compared to 22CTA.\nSuch a core structure with two G-tetrads sandwiched\nbetween two G.C.G.C tetrads, which has already been\nobserved previously (46), would provide a well-aligned\nchannel for K+ ion coordination. Our results indicate\nthat G.C.G.C tetrads may positively contribute to\nG-quadruplex stability (43\u201346,48), in contrast to very\ndetrimental effects observed for many tetrads of guanine\nderivatives (49).\nAlthough the G-quadruplex fold of 22CTA contains\nonly two G-tetrad layers, its stability is comparable to\nthat of the structures containing three G-tetrads (29).\nThis can be explained by molecular interactions seen in\nour structure including the formation of a G.C base pair\nand a G.C.G.C tetrad, and additional base stacking\ninteractions in the loops. The principle of this folding\nand base arrangement is analogous to that observed\nfor Form 3 human telomeric G-quadruplex in K+ solu-\ntion (29), and reinforces the view that the overall folding\ntopology of a G-quadruplex is defined not only by\nmaximizing the number of G-tetrads, but also by\nmaximizing all possible base pairing and stacking in the\nloops (29).\nCONCLUSION\nWe have shown that sequences containing four human\ntelomeric variant CTAGGG repeats adopt a novel\nantiparallel G-quadruplex involving two G-tetrads\nFigure 5.
