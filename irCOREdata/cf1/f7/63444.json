Geostatistics was used for mapping, indicating high local variances but \nclear spatial autocorrelations. Inference statistics identified differences of metal \nconcentrations in mosses on both sides of the national borders. However, \ngeostatistical analyses did not ascertain discontinuities of metal concentrations in \nmosses at national borders due to sample analysis in different laboratories \napplying a range of analytical techniques. Applying Classification and Regression \nTrees (CART) to the German moss data as an example, the local variation in \nmetal concentrations in mosses were proved to depend mostly on different moss \nspecies, potential local emission sources, canopy drip and precipitation.  \n \nCapsule: Factors affecting the spatial variation in metal accumulation in mosses were \nmapped by geostatistics and ranked by CART.  \n \nKeywords: CART; geostatistics; metal bioaccumulation; mosses; ordination. \n \n \n 4 \n1 Introduction \nThe European moss surveys of 1990, 1995 and 2000 enabled to map metal concentrations \nacross the borderlines of the participating countries (Harmens et al., 2004; Schr\u00f6der and Pesch, \n2004). However, several studies revealed significant spatial variation and the metal concentration \nin mosses to be correlated with moss species, canopy drip, precipitation, altitude, distance to the \nsea and analytical techniques (Berg and Steinnes, 1997; Frahm, 1998; Herpin et al., 2004; \nZechmeister et al., 2003). As contradicting results were reported (\u010ceburnis and Valiulis, 1999; \nSiewers and Herpin, 1998; Siewers et al., 2000), the interpretation of the moss data remained \ndifficult (Herpin, 1997). Since environmental planning and policy need information which is valid \nat higher spatial levels than individual sampling sites, the integration of site-specific \nmeasurements and the connections between monitoring networks should be achieved (Ferretti, \n2001; Parr et al., 2002). This implies the generalisation of measurement values from sampling \nsites to areas of greater extend (Miller et al., 2004). This study aimed at achieving this by cross-\nborder geostatistical analysis of the moss survey data from Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, \nItaly, Slovakia, Slovenia, Poland, and Switzerland. A second aim was to rank factors that, in \naddition to metal deposition, affect the spatial patterns of metal bioaccumulation. Special attention \nwas given to the question whether the effect of the metal analyses in participating laboratories \ncause significant differences of metal bioaccumulation data on both sides of the borders between \nthe countries. \n \n2 Materials and Methods \n2.1 Data \nThe moss survey data of 1990, 1995 and 2000 (Table 1) covering the eight European countries \nwere used to examine whether the measured values were spatially valid for both the sampling \n 5 \nsites and adjacent areas. Detailed information on characteristics of the sampling sites (Table 2 \nrows 1 to 11) and their surroundings (Table 2 rows 12 to 30) was only available from the German \nMoss Monitoring Information System (GEMMIS). With the exception of the distance to the sea, all \nfactors which could influence metal accumulation in mosses  were restricted to the sampling sites \nor the area within a 5 km radius around them. This enabled to rank some causes of spatial \nvariation underlying the nugget effects in the variogram analyses which often remained \nunexplained.  \n \n2.2 Statistical methods \nThe laboratory differences were tested by means of the Mann-Whitney U-Test. CART was used \nto ordinate the site-specific and regional factors that influence the metal bioaccumulation in \naddition to the atmospheric metal deposition. For all descriptive and inference statistical analyses \nSPSS 12.0 was used. The CART-analyses were performed using the SPSS module Answer Tree \n3.1. For all geostatistical analyses the Geostatistical Analyst from the ESRI-product ArcGIS 9.1 \nwas applied. \n \n2.2.1 Classification Trees \nCART enables processing large sets of mixed data, i.e. nominal, ordinal and metric scale data, \nwithout prior transformation. CART allows uncovering hierarchical and non-linear relationships \namong one dependent variable and several predictors. This is achieved by nested binary \u201cif-then-\nelse\u201d splits, each maximising the homogeneity of the target variable. The Gini index is commonly \nused as impurity measure when the target variable is categorical. The predictor selected is the \none for which the two new classes have both the greatest difference from each other and the \ngreatest within-group similarity for the response variable. The two new classes are then examined \n 6 \nseparately with respect to each of the predictor variables to see if they can be split again. CART \ndoes not make any assumptions regarding the distribution of the data and can use predictors \nmore than once, thus multiple interrelations can be detected (Breiman et al. 1984). \n \n2.2.2 Geostatistics \nSince monitoring data should also be valid for areas beyond the sampling sites, surface maps \nshould be produced from measurement data if they are spatially auto-correlated. Spatial auto-\ncorrelation can be examined by variogram analysis. The mean squared differences of all pairs of \nmeasurement values (semi-variances) were calculated for so called bins of a variogram map to \nderive an experimental semi-variogram. This procedure may result in more than one semi-\nvariogram value per lag. In order to perform kriging it is necessary to adapt a defined variogram \nmodel to the experimental variogram. This can be achieved by means of mathematical models \nfitted to the experimental variogram in terms of a least-squares regression line. A variogram \nmodel can be described by three parameters: range, sill and nugget-effect. The range equals the \nmaximum separation distance for which a distinct increase of semi-variogram values, and \ntherefore spatial autocorrelation, can be observed. The sill corresponds to the semi-variance \nassigned to the range. Spatial variability within the first lag can be caused by measurement errors \nand other confounding factors resulting in high semi-variances. Such nugget effects remain \nunexplained in most investigations. \nBased on the variogram model, several kriging methods can be used for spatial predictions. They \nall minimise the estimation variance and rely on weighted averaging of the measured values \nwithin a chosen kriging window. For the interpretation of the kriging estimations one needs to \nknow how far the predictions deviate from the quality-controlled measurement values. To achieve \nthis, iteratively each measurement point is extracted from the sample and, based on the \nrespective variogram model, estimated again using the surrounding auto-correlated measurement \n 7 \nvalues. This cross-validation quantifies how well the model estimates values at locations without \nmeasurements. Differences between measured and estimated values can be described by the \nmean error (ME), the root mean square standardised error (RMSSE), the median percentile error \n(MPE), the MPE adjusted to the ratio of the empirical value range and the absolute cross-\nvalidation error range (MPEc), and the coefficient of correlation by Pearson (C). \nThe ME equals the average value of the differences between measured and estimated values \nand is a measure of the degree of bias. If the ME equals 0, the model can be assumed to be \nunbiased. By setting the respective measured value to 100%, the difference between the \nmeasured and predicted values may be calculated in percent. The MPE then is the median value \nof the percentile deviations, and enables a comparison of the quality of the estimation of several \nmeasured variables, e.g. metal concentrations. The MPEc adjusts the MPE with regard to the \ndifferent ranges of the measurement values and the cross-validation errors. The RMSSE is a \nmeasure of the mean squared deviation between measured and estimated values standardised \nby the kriging variance. Ideally, the RMSSE should equal 1. C quantifies the correlation between \nthe measurements and estimations (Olea, 1999).  \n \n3 Results \n3.1 Spatial patterns of bioaccumulation  \nIn order to map the spatial patterns of the metal bioaccumulation across Austria, the Czech \nRepublic, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, Poland, and Switzerland, data from these countries \nwere analysed geostatistically with regard to the concentration of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, \nV, and Zn in mosses. The Gau\u00df-Kr\u00fcger coordinate system (date: Potsdam; ellipsoid: Bessel; 15th \nmeridian) was used as a geographical reference system. To be able to detect temporal trends, \nonly data sets were selected from the national databases where identical moss species were \n 8 \ncollected since 1990 or 1995. As a result, in 1990 94 (Hg) to 477 (Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni) measurement \nvalues were analysed (Table 3). For the 1995 and 2000 surveys, 1061 (Hg) to 1257 (Cr) and \n1072 (Hg) to 1266 (Cd, Fe) values were used for the computations, respectively. Figure 1 \nillustrates the geographical locations of the sampling sites and the moss species collected. The \nmapping of the metal bioaccumulation was restricted conservatively to 60 km around the \nmonitoring sites, which clearly is far beneath the maximum auto-correlation range (Figure 2).  \nThe descriptive statistical analyses reveal high variability with regard to all elements and years \n(Table 3). The coefficients of variation exceed 100% in 15 of 30 cases. Highest variability was \nfound for Cu in 1995 (218%) and Hg in 1995 (317%) and 2000 (281%). In addition, all elements \nshow highly left skewed distributions, expressed by a skewness of above 1 in all cases. The \nhighest skewness was found for Cd in 1995 (21.7) and 2000 (10.8) and for Hg in 1995 (30.6) and \n2000 (11.9). The large differences between the 98th percentile and the maximum values \nfurthermore indicate the existence of outliers.  \nRegarding the calculation of experimental semi-variograms, the average distance of each \nmeasurement site to its nearest neighbour was set as a starting point for the lag size (Webster \nand Oliver, 2001). This is considered a \u201csafe practice\u201d when encountering irregular sampling \nconfigurations because it allows to give consideration to the spatial distribution of sampling sites \n(Olea, 1999). The number of lags assigned to each lag size should enable an optimal detection of \nthe autocorrelation structure. In most cases hardly any spatial autocorrelation was found using \nthe raw data. Since all elements showed highly left skewed distributions, the metal concentrations \nin mosses were transformed lognormally and variogram analyses and kriging was carried out with \nthe transformed values. Such transformations were done for all elements and years except for V \nin 1990 and in 1995 (Table 4). In seven cases even the lognormally transformed data showed no \nspatial autocorrelation. Therefore, sites showing the highest ratios of squared cross-validation \nerrors and kriging variances were excluded iteratively until spatial autocorrelation could be \ndetected. If the sill cannot be visualised in the variogram window even when applying high lag \n 9 \nsizes and numbers of lags, this is indicative of deterministic trends in the data. Therefore, second \norder polynomial functions were calculated and then subtracted from the measurement values. \nThe residuals were then used for variogram analysis and for the kriging procedures. Except for V \nin 1990 such a universal kriging approach was performed in all cases (Table 4). For Cd, Cr, Ni \nand Pb in 1990 no autocorrelation could be detected due to pure nugget effects. \nIn all cases spherical variogram models fitted the experimental semi-variogram values best. All \nmodels showed high nugget-sill ratios (Table 4), indicating high local variability of the \nmeasurement data; apart from two exceptions these ratios were above 0.5. The highest nugget \neffect was detected for Cu in 1990, accounting for 84% of the sill. The auto-correlation ranges \nwere between 91 and 333 km. Except for V in 1990 and 1995, a lognormal universal kriging \napproach was used to estimate values for a 16 km by 16 km grid. The grid resolution was set \naccording to the average mean nearest neighbour distance of all measurement sites. A four-\nsector neighbourhood was defined to avoid directional bias and a maximum of five points was \naccounted for in each sector to estimate a certain point. The results of the kriging procedures for \nZn concentrations in mosses in 1990, 1995 and 2000 are shown as an example (Figure 2). The \nmaps illustrate that, except for Germany, a continuous decrease of Zn bioaccumulation occurred \nwith time. The highest Zn values were estimated for Slovakia (in 1990) and for Katowice in \nPoland (all three campaigns).  \nTo describe the quality of the surface estimations, the ME-, RMSSE-, MPE-, MPEc-, and the C-\nvalues were calculated from the results of cross-validation (Table 5). Whereas the ME indicated \nneither underestimation nor overestimation in almost all cases, this was not true for the RMSSE. \nWith the exception of Hg in 1990 and 1995, the variances calculated from the cross-validation \nerrors by average were higher than the theoretical kriging variances. A maximum of this ratio was \nobserved for Pb in 1995. Due to local variability and the variances referred to in Table 3, high \nMPE-values were observed in almost all cases. The MPEc allowed comparing the different \n 10 \nelements more reliably, ranging from 11.7% for Hg to 35.1% for As in 1995. C was lowest for As \nin 1990 and 1995 and reached values above 0.5 in all but six cases. \n \n3.2 Variability due to laboratories, altitude and sea spray  \nThe U-tests proved significant differences on both sides each of the frontiers between the eight \nEuropean countries (Table 6). Concerning the effects of altitude and sea spray on the metal \naccumulation in Germany no clear trends could be identified (Table 7).  \n \n3.3 Ranking factors of spatial variability \nCART allowed ranking the factors causing the spatial variability of the metal concentrations which \nwere geostatistically quantified for arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron \n(Fe), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V) and zinc (Zn) \nin terms of the nugget effect. Using Ni as an example, it is demonstrated how to read a CART-\nDendrogram (Figure 3). \nThe statistical distribution of Ni concentrations is depicted in the box on top of the two \ndendrograms. The mean Ni concentration in mosses was 2.63, 1.86 and 1.33 \u03bcg g-1 in 1990, \n1995 and 2000, respectively. Although for the Ni accumulation in 1990 no statistically relevant \nfactor could be detected, in 1995 as well as in 2000, the moss species was the most powerful \npredictor. For 1995 the following two subgroups resulted from the first split: node 1 encompasses \n778 samplings sites where the mean Ni concentration in Pleurozium schreberi and Scleropodium \npurum was 1.66 \u03bcg g-1; 201 sites were clustered into node 2 with a mean Ni concentration in \npredominantly Hypnum cupressiforme of 2.65 \u03bcg g-1. Node 1 was subdivided by the spatial \ndensity of traffic routes within 5 km around the sampling sites. If the density of traffic routes was \nless than 6.45%, then the mean Ni concentration in mosses was 1.62 \u03bcg g-1 (node 3). In cases \n 11 \nwhere the traffic density exceeded this value, the mean Ni concentration was 2.73 \u03bcg g-1 (node \n4). Node 2 was split by the percentage of urban areas within 5 km of the monitoring sites. If this \npercentage was below 8.24%, the mean Ni concentration in mosses was 2.49 \u03bcg g-1 and if it \nexceeded 8.24% the mean Ni concentration was 3.57 \u03bcg g-1. The CART-tree for Ni in 2000 shows \nsimilar properties as the one for 1995.  \nIn further CART-models the other twelve metals were defined as the target variable. The results \nare summarised here with regard to the hierarchy and the frequency of the predictor variables \nwithin the decision trees. The moss species most frequently subdivided the root node into two \nsub-nodes (11 times) and occurred most frequently throughout all levels of the decision trees (14 \ntimes). In most cases H. cupressiforme was separated from the P. schreberi and S. purum. In \ngeneral, the subgroups in which H. cupressiforme was present showed higher metal \nbioaccumulation than the subgroups with P. schreberi and S. purum. The latter two species \nformed sub-nodes where the metal concentrations showed distributions similar to those in the \nroot node. Subordinated to the moss species, predictors related to potential emission sources \naround the monitoring sites, canopy drip and precipitation proved to be the most dominant \npredictors in the calculated decision trees, i.e. 11, 10 and 8 times respectively. Altitude and \ndistance of the sampling sites to the sea occurred five and two times, respectively. \n \n4 Discussion \nThis investigation is the first geostatistical mapping of the metal accumulation in mosses across \nthe national borders of Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, Poland, \nand Switzerland. The variogram analyses depicted spatial autocorrelation although high nugget \neffects gave hints on the existence of small scale variability of the metal loads in the mosses. \nFurthermore, this study includes the first CART-analysis of the factors associated with the spatial \nvariability of the metal bioaccumulation. Mainly the moss species, potential emission sources \n 12 \naround the monitoring sites, canopy drip and precipitation were proved to cause the spatial \nvariability of the metal accumulation. Furthermore, different techniques for digestion and analysis \nseem to influence the measurements. However, geostatistical analyses did not ascertain \ndiscontinuities of metal bioaccumulation at the national borders due to different analytical \ntechniques, as other factors proved to be more important in explaining the variation in metal \nconcentrations in mosses. \nSiewers and Herpin (1998) investigated the correlation between the metal concentrations in P. \nschreberi and S. purum and between P. schreberi and H. cupressiforme. No distinct tendency \ncould be derived from the results of regression analysis due to the low amount of samples and \nhigh dispersion around the regression function. K\u00f6hler and Peichl (1993) found that H. \ncupressiforme accumulates at least twice as much metal as P. schreberi. However, R\u00fchling and \nTyler (1968) found that the metal accumulation was only slightly higher in H. cupressiforme than \nin Hylocomium splendens  and P. schreberi. In contrast, Folkeson (1979) detected much higher \nPb concentrations in H. cupressiforme compared to H. splendens and P. schreberi. Throughout \nGermany, Schr\u00f6der et al. (2002) measured significantly higher concentrations of As, Cd, Hg, Ni \nand Pb in H. cupressiforme compared with the other mosses which were collected from different \nsites. This observation may be explained by the surface morphology of H. cupressiforme, which is \nlikely to enhance the capture of metals from the atmosphere.  \nFern\u00e1ndez et al. (2000, 2002) stated that an interspecies calibration for H. cupressiforme and S. \npurum is urgently needed. Interspecies calibration tests of metal concentrations in P. schreberi, \nS. purum and H. cupressiforme in the Czech Republic revealed insignificant (p > 0.05) \ndifferences in aluminium (Al), As, Cd, cobalt (Co), Cr, Cu, Fe, molybdenum (Mo), Ni, Pb, sulphur \n(S), V and Zn concentrations in P. schreberi and S. purum, whilst in H. cupressiforme these \nelements accumulated up to 112-225% of the concentration found in P. schreberi and S. purum \n(Suchara and Sucharov\u00e1, 1998). H. cupressiforme had significantly higher concentrations of Al, \n 13 \nCo, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn than P. schreberi and S. purum. It was hypothesized that the higher metal \nconcentrations in H. cupressiforme were due to contamination rather than to a higher efficiency of \nelement capture. Th\u00f6ni et al. (1996) found higher concentrations of Ni, Pb and Zn in H. \ncupressiforme than in P. schreberi at three sampling sites, but no species-specific variation for \nCu. However, these differences were small compared with the variability of several other \ncharacteristics at each of the sites. These results were corrobated by Zechmeister (1994) who \nfound slightly higher concentrations in H. cupressiforme than in P. schreberi and H. splendens but \nsignificant higher amounts only for Ni and Cd. The slopes of regression relationships between P. \nschreberi and the moss species H. splendens, H. cupressiforme and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus \nsampled at the same sites in the UK were in most cases and for most metals close to unity, \nsuggesting no species-specific efficiencies in the capture of metals from the atmosphere \n(Ashmore et al., 2000). Possibly the differences in metal accumulation between moss species are \nmetal-specific and vary with climate conditions and other site characteristics. \nThe precipitation is an important factor controlling wet atmospheric deposition of elements, \nwashing out dry deposition, leaching elements from plants and affecting moss production. Main \nvariables co-operating with the precipitation are altitude, geomorphology and wind conditions. \nThe amount of precipitation could be correlated with the metal bioaccumulation due to \natmospheric rain out and wash out-effect (\u010ceburnis and Valiulis, 1997; Frahm, 1998; \nZechmeister, 1995). But heavy rain could also remove dry deposition from mosses before \nincorporation or contaminate the mosses by splash erosion (Herpin, 1997). There is a strong \ncorrelation between altitude and precipitation, and therefore correlation between metal \nconcentration in mosses and altitude have been proven empirically (Fowler et al., 1988; Soltes, \n1992, Zechmeister, 1995). However, partial regression analyses showed significant (p < 0.05) \npositive and negative correlations between the precipitation without the effect of altitude and \nconcentrations of Ag, Ba, Bi, Cd, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, In, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, S, Se, Sn, Tl, V, Zn (rp = \n0.18-0.55) and Mn (rb = -0.27) in moss samples in the Czech Republic. Although strong positive \n 14 \ncorrelations between precipitation and metal deposition were proven, no correlations were found \nbetween precipitation and the leaching of elements (except Mn) from mosses or the initiation of \nmoss production (Sucharov\u00e1 and Suchara, 2004b).  \nThe predictors which represent the canopy drip effect were of third importance according to the \nCART-analyses. This is in agreement with \u00d8kland et al. (1999) who proved correlations between \nmetal concentrations in H. splendens and the density of trees and crowns, respectively.  \nHowever, this is contrary to findings reported by Fern\u00e1ndez and Carballeira (2002) and \u010ceburnis \nand Steinnes (2000). In the Czech Republic, moss samples were collected in large open spaces \nin forests and were therefore little affected by throughfall and canopy drip from trees. The \nconcentration of the mainly geogenous elements Al, As, Co, Cr, Fe, Hg, S and V in the mosses \ndecreased significantly (p < 0.01) with the forest cover percentage in a 5-km radius around the \nsampling plots (Sucharaov\u00e1 and Suchara, 2004a), indicating an effective filtering of dust particles \nby forests. \nAltitude is easy to determine but a rather complex explanatory variable. Many more or less strong \ncovariables occur along altitudinal gradients: precipitation, vegetation, wind speed, air density, \nspatial density of settlements and anthropogenic activities, which can influence the emission and \ndeposition of air pollutants and moss production. Consequently, the results on the correlation \nbetween altitude and the accumulation of metals in mosses are contraditory. Gerdol et al. (2002) \nfound decreasing concentrations of Al, Ca, Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, Mo, Ni, Pb in H. splendens with \nincreasing altitude. They hypothesised that this was due to increasing biomass production and \ndecreasing metal binding capacity with increasing altitude. The opposite was observed for Cd, \nCu, Mg, Na, Zn. Zechmeister (1995) found positive correlations between the concentrations of \nPb, Cd, Zn and S in mosses and altitude and precipitation. However, he stated that this could \nalso be related to the atmospheric deposition by increasing amounts of rain and reduced \nvegetation cover at higher altitudes. This was corroborated by Sucharova and Suchara (2004b). \n 15 \nThe concentrations of Al, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, S, and V in mosses throughout the Czech \nRepublic decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with altitude. Even after filtering out the effect of \nprecipitation as a tight covariable, the concentrations of all these elements and the concentrations \nof Cd, Mo, Pb and Zn in mosses were negatively correlated with increasing altitude (Sucharov\u00e1 \nand Suchara, 2004a). Without the precipitation effect, significant negative relationships between \naltitude and Ag, Be, Bi, Ce, Ga, In, La, Li, Pr, Se, Th, U and Y and significant positive \nrelationships for Cs and Rb were also proven (Sucharov\u00e1 and Suchara, 2004b). Even after \nelimination of the precipitation effect in the variable altitude, the variable still remained too \ncomplex to reveal exact causality. Most of investigated elements may be bound on particulate \ncarriers, which concentration decreases with altitude. On the other hand, increased \nconcentrations of Cs and Rb in mosses might be explained by increased concentration of these \nelements in the local mountain rocks and release of Cs and Rb to the environment by erosion.  \n \n5 Conclusion \nThe main factors that influence the bioaccumulation of metals in mosses could be ranked as \nfollows: moss species, potential emission sources around the monitoring site, canopy drip and \nprecipitation. They should be identified before producing transboundary maps on metal \nbioaccumulation. This will only be feasible if all participating countries provide additional \ninformation about site characteristics as currently is done in e.g. the German moss surveys. \nFurthermore, a harmonized procedure for digestion and analysis should be aimed for.  \n 16 \nLiterature \nAshmore, M., Bell, S., Fowler, D., Hill, M., Jordan, C., Nemitz, E., Parry, S., Pugh, B., Reynolds, \nB., Williams, J., 2000.
