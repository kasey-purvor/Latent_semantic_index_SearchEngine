Money is the new \u2018totemic\u2019 possession \n(Ernest Becker).1 \nWoe to every [kind of] scandal-monger and-backbiter, who pileth up \nwealth (m\ufffdl) and layeth it by, thinking that his wealth would make \nhim last for ever! (Q. 104:1\u20133). \nIntroduction \nHistorically, academic research on the Qur\u2019anic approach to wealth and ownership \nhas been carried out largely from two disciplinary perspectives: jurisprudence and \neconomics. For the jurist, the Qur\u2019anic ayas which deal with this issue are an \nimportant primary source for the deduction of rulings pertaining to inheritance, \nalimony, bride-price and a whole host of commercial transactions which fall under \nthe remit of Shar\u0131fia law. For the economist, the Qur\u2019anic approach to wealth is the \nunavoidable point of entry to the discipline of Islamic economics and finance, and to \ncontemporary debate on the application of Shar\u0131fia norms to the modern economy. \nSimilarly, outwith the Islamic tradition, much has been written on the anthropology \nof wealth accumulation and the history of man\u2019s obsession with money and private \nownership. On the symbology of wealth in the Qur\u2019an, however, little if anything has \nbeen written. \nIn a number of key Qur\u2019anic ayas, inordinate love of wealth (m\ufffdl) is presented as \none of the obstacles preventing man from wholehearted submission to the truths of \nrevelation. Together with idolatry and blind allegiance to ancestral customs, wealth-\npride is a characteristic shared by all of the \u2018addressee communities\u2019 whose stories \nare recounted in the Qur\u2019an.2 For some of these groups, one\u2019s honour and position in \nsociety depends almost exclusively on the amount one owns and the number of \noffspring one begets, and the accumulation of property and children has primacy \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 59 \nover all other worldly objectives. Consequently, not only do the teachings of \nprophets regarding wealth fall repeatedly on deaf ears, but the prophets themselves \nare rejected on the grounds that they lack what all men prize most highly: abundance \nof wealth and progeny.3 \nThe aim of this paper is to focus on a dimension of the Qur\u2019anic discourse on wealth \nwhich has hitherto been overlooked. In one singularly enigmatic aya, Q. 104:3, the \nQur\u2019an interprets the lure of material possessions as nothing less than a symptom of \nman\u2019s desire to live forever. Taking this aya as our conceptual starting point, this \npaper aims to explore the notion of wealth as an immortality symbol, with particular \nreference to those passages in the Qur\u2019an which detail the negative encounters \nbetween the prophets and their addressee communities. Using as our theoretical basis \nthe principle of \u2018immortality striving\u2019 developed by cultural anthropologist Ernest \nBecker, we shall explore the ramifications of Q. 104:1\u20133 for the rest of the ayas on \nm\ufffdl, guided by the hypothesis that not only is the desire for immortality key to our \nunderstanding of the \u2018rejection narratives\u2019, but also that it is crucial to our \nappreciation of the psycho-dynamics which underpin all human activity. \nTo this end, the study will focus on the Qur\u2019anic use of the word m\ufffdl (wealth; \nproperty) and its plural amw\ufffdl (goods; possessions; belongings), particularly in the \ncontext of the rejection narratives. The m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl verses are of course not the only \nmeans through which the Qur\u2019an deals with the issue of wealth, ownership and \u2013 by \nextension \u2013 aspirations to immortality. As W. Montgomery Watt asserts quite \nrightly, the concept of istighn\ufffd\u221a or the feeling of pride that comes with the \nperception that one\u2019s wealth has made one independent, particularly of God, is an \nimportant sub-text in the rejection of Mu\u02dbammad by the Meccan henotheists.4 \nSimilarly, ayas such as Q. 102:1, which alludes to man\u2019s desire to surpass his fellow \nmen in terms of acquisition of worldly abundance, are also important indicators of \nthe pre-Mu\u02dbammadan attitude to ownership.5 However, the scope of an article such \nas this means that workable limits have to be drawn and frames of reference \nestablished. Consequently, m\ufffdl and amw\ufffdl have been chosen as the subject of \nanalysis, although, it must be said, not for the sake of brevity and focus alone: \nwealth, possessions and offspring are, as this paper attempts to show, the most \nconspicuous of all the immortality symbols which appear in the Qur\u2019an, and as such \nlend themselves more readily to analysis from a Beckerian perspective.6 \nM\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl: Definition and Terms of Reference \nThere is no consensus regarding either the origin of the Arabic word m\ufffdl or its \nprecise meaning. According to Pressner, the word is formed from m\ufffd and l\u0131 and \nmeans properly anything that belongs to anyone;7 another explanation is that it \nderives from the root mawwala, one meaning of which is \u2018to finance\u2019.8 Ibn Man\u00f7\u00fcr \ndefines m\ufffdl as things commonly known and which can be owned,9 while Ibn al-Ath\u0131r \n60 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \ndefines it as everything that one owns.10 These definitions take into account the \ncustomary practices of the pre-Islamic Arabs. Originally, the Arabs used the term to \nrefer only to gold and silver, but subsequently its application was extended to \ninclude things owned physically \u2013 camels in particular. \nJurisprudential definitions of the word m\ufffdl are also not few in number. For the \n\u02d8anaf\u0131s, m\ufffdl must be something which exists physically and is desirable; according \nto Ibn fi\u25cabid\u0131n, it is whatever human instinct inclines to and is also capable of being \nstored for future use.11 Consequently, rights and usufruct do not constitute m\ufffdl since \nthey are incapable of being stored. The definitions given by M\ufffdlik\u0131, Sh\ufffdfifi\u0131 and \n\u02d8anbal\u0131 scholars appear to be as one with regard to the criteria by which something \ncan be considered m\ufffdl. For the M\ufffdlik\u0131s, as represented here by al-Sh\ufffd\u2020ib\u0131, m\ufffdl is \nanything over which ownership is exercised and which the owner is free to enjoy \nwithout fear of expropriation by others.12 The Sh\ufffdfifi\u0131 school defines m\ufffdl as that \nwhich gives benefit; al-Suy\u00fc\u2020\u0131 asserts that the word refers to anything that is both \nvaluable and exchangeable, and whose owner is entitled to compensation in the \nevent of its destruction.13 The \u02d8anbal\u0131s define m\ufffdl as things from which benefit \naccrues and which are capable of being used in normal circumstances.14 \nAs can be seen from the above, if the jurisprudential schools differ on this issue, it is \non the question of emphasis, with the M\ufffdlik\u0131s underscoring the concept of \nownership; the Sh\ufffdfifi\u0131s stressing the importance of value; and the \u02d8anbal\u0131s singling \nout the issue of benefit and usability. The diversity of these perspectives allows us to \nposit the widest possible definition of m\ufffdl to include things which are tangible or \nintangible, corporeal or incorporeal. Thus the definitional scope of m\ufffdl can be seen \nto include ownership over non-material things such as rights and usufruct, so long, \nof course, as they do not contravene the precepts of the Shar\u0131fia. Such a definition of \nm\ufffdl also allows us to confine our English translation to one word, \u2018wealth\u2019, which \nmay express either anything that one owns which has economic utility; or an \nabundance of material possessions and resources, depending on the context. \nThe matter at hand \u2013 wealth as an immortality symbol \u2013 is, of course, as far removed \nfrom the ambit of jurisprudence as we can get. Furthermore, the Beckerian paradigm \nis far more concerned with the hubris of \u2018wealth-pride\u2019 than it is with the definitional \nlimits of the word \u2018wealth\u2019. However, it is important for the foundations of our \ndiscussion to establish a certain level of convergence between the scholarly \nunderstanding of m\ufffdl in Muslim circles and the notion of wealth used by Becker. In \nhis later works, wealth is used in the broadest sense possible, signifying either \nanything one possesses or, as pointed out earlier, an abundance of what is possessed. \nThere is, therefore, common ground between the Qur\u2019anic meaning of m\ufffdl and that \nwhich is understood by Becker. \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 61 \nIn its Qur\u2019anic context, amw\ufffdl, the plural form of m\ufffdl, is translated variously as \n\u2018goods\u2019, \u2018property\u2019 and \u2018possessions\u2019. Conceptually, there appears to be little \ndifference between m\ufffdl and amw\ufffdl, just as there is little difference between the \nEnglish words \u2018wealth\u2019 and \u2018belongings\u2019. However, the fact that the word amw\ufffdl is \nused with far greater frequency in the Medinan ayas than in the Meccan may suggest \nthat there is a technical aspect to the plural which does not apply to the singular.15 \nThe m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl Verses in the Qur\u2019an: An Overview \nIt is appropriate at this point to attempt a conspectus of the Qur\u2019anic treatment of \nm\ufffdl and amw\ufffdl. Not only will this provide us with insights into how the Islamic \nrevelation deals with the issue of wealth and ownership, but it will also serve to \ncontextualise the issue of immortality symbology within a wider conceptual \nframework. \nDating individual suras of the Qur\u2019an and establishing a workable chronology of \nrevelation has never been an exact science, and as Neal Robinson points out, there is \nstill no universally acclaimed tradition about the precise sequence in which the suras \nappeared.16 There is, however, general agreement as to which suras belong to the \nMeccan phase of the revelation and which ones were revealed in Medina.17 \nCompartmentalising any group of subject-related suras according to whether they are \npre- or post-Hijr\u0131 often helps to throw light on the issue of thematic progression, and \nas we shall see this is certainly true to a large degree in the case of the m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl \nverses.18 \nA statistical survey of the Qur\u2019an reveals 21 occurrences of the word m\ufffdl and 9 \noccurrences of its plural, amw\ufffdl, in suras believed to have been revealed in Mecca.19 \nIn the Medinan suras, however, there are only 4 occurrences of the word m\ufffdl, while \namw\ufffdl appears no fewer than 52 times. This would appear to support the suggestion \nmade earlier that m\ufffdl correlates in part with a more abstract idea of wealth, whereas \namw\ufffdl denotes for the most part the kind of tangible possessions that are subject to \nlegislation, such as moveable wealth and taxable goods. The Medinan section is, one \nmust remember, the locus classicus for the lion\u2019s share of legislative ayas in the \nQur\u2019an, and in this light it is arguably not surprising that occurrences of amw\ufffdl \npreponderate. \nThematically, the m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl verses break down into three broad categories: the \ndefinitional; the condemnatory; and the prescriptive. As one might expect, this \ntypology is fluid and admits of a certain amount of overlap. Generally speaking, ayas \nclassified here as definitional are those in which the purpose of m\ufffdl in both human \nsociety and the greater cosmic scheme is delineated; passages which define and \nexemplify the attitude and behaviour of believers with respect to wealth are also \nincluded in this group. Condemnatory ayas are those in which \u2018unregenerate man\u2019 is \n62 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \ndenounced either on account of his failure to understand the true nature and function \nof m\ufffdl or as a result of his blatant abuse of wealth and position.20 Prescriptive ayas \nare in the main those in which precepts on the correct use of m\ufffdl are laid out; on \naccount of overlap, certain examples of righteous conduct with regard to wealth are \nalso included in this category.21 \nThat most of the 29 ayas on m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl which appeared in Mecca are condemnatory \nshould come as no surprise given the socio-cultural context in which Mu\u02dbammad\u2019s \nrevelatory experience took place. Immediately, one senses, he needed to draw a \nnumber of distinct lines of demarcation between his nascent community of believers \nand the henotheistic society in which they were embedded. With regard to the issue \nof m\ufffdl, Mu\u02dbammad drew such a line by denouncing the socio-cultural attitudes to \nwealth prevalent in Meccan society, rejecting it as thoroughly and \nuncompromisingly as the previous prophets had rejected the wealth-worship of their \naddressee communities, and for the same reason. Thus we read in the Meccan ayas \non m\ufffdl that man in general is afflicted by an inordinate love of wealth, which he \noften abuses with apparent impunity (Q. 89:19\u201320, And ye devour inheritance \u2013 all \nwith greed, and ye love wealth with inordinate love!). The problem, however, would \nappear to be attitudinal rather than the simple matter of occasional profligacy. The \nMeccan portrait of unregenerate man paints him as someone for whom wealth is the \nkey to both self-esteem and social status (Q. 68:14, he possesses wealth and \n[numerous] sons). Abundance of possessions is something revered for its ability to \ncommand the respect of others, and the Qur\u2019an highlights the futility of those who \neither trust or ally themselves with others because of their greater wealth: \n[Abundant] was the produce this man had: he said to his companion, \nin the course of a mutual argument: \u2018Let him who will, believe, and \nlet him who will, reject [it]\u2019: For the wrong-doers We have prepared \na Fire whose [smoke and flames] like the walls and roof of a tent, will \nhem them in (Q. 18:34). \nIndeed, so important is wealth to unregenerate man as an indicator of esteem that it \nbecomes for him the criterion by which he judges the validity of claims to \nprophethood; consequently, those who purport to bring messages from God yet lack \nthe power that flows from the possession of visible wealth are rejected, as in Q.71:21 \n(Noah said: \u2018O my Lord they have disobeyed me, but they follow [men] whose \nwealth and children give them no increase but only loss). Previous messengers were \nalso rejected on account of the admonitory nature of their teachings on wealth: the \npeople of the prophet Shufiayb, for instance, were loathe to accept his call on account \nof the fact that it would mean not only giving up their idols but also relinquishing \ntheir freedom to do as they pleased with their wealth: \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 63 \nThey said: \u2018O Shufiayb! Does thy prayer command thee that we leave \noff the worship which our fathers practised, or that we leave off doing \nwhat we like with our property? (Q. 11:87). \nThere are also men for whom wealth is not merely an indication of worldly good \nfortune: an abundance of possessions and offspring is also considered by some to be \na sign of divine favour, a conceit which the Qur\u2019an is quick to reject (as in Q. 23:55\u2013\n6, Do they think that because We have granted them abundance of wealth and sons, \nWe would hasten them on in every good?).22 Others believe that if there is a final \njudgement for man, wealth will have an intercessory role, acting as a means of \nprotection against God\u2019s wrath, a position to which the Qur\u2019an, again, responds (in, \nfor example, Q. 26:88, On that Day, neither wealth nor sons will avail).23 \nFurthermore, there are those, the Qur\u2019an asserts, who pileth up wealth and layeth it \nby, thinking that his wealth would make him last for ever! (Q. 104:1\u20133). \nThe Meccan ayas on m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl thus read like a series of cautionary reminders of \nthe dangers inherent in the fetishisation of wealth \u2013 an affliction which, the Qur\u2019an \nasserts, has blighted communities throughout history and prevented them from \nattaining true faith. Wealth and sons, the Qur\u2019an avers in Q.18:46, are nothing more \nthan allurements of the life of this world: they are ephemeral and should not be taken \nas the foundation for hope. Indeed, wealth and children (al-amw\ufffdl wa\u2019l-awl\ufffdd) are, \nwe are told in Q. 17:64, just two of the means by which Satan attempts to fill man \nwith pride and thus facilitate his downfall. \nApart from two allusions to charitable giving,24 and two enjoinders not to take \nadvantage of the property of orphans,25 there is little by way of prescription in the \nMeccan ayas on m\ufffdl. In the post-Hijr\u0131 revelations, however, a considerable change of \nemphasis occurs. With the advent of the Medinan community-state and the reshaping \nof the religious, political and socio-economic framework, a more nuanced exposition \nof the true nature and function of wealth is forthcoming. Wealth is now posited as a \ncomponent of man\u2019s trial on earth: whether it leads to his felicity or his ruin depends \non how he uses his wealth, and whether he disposes of it in accordance with the \ndictates of true belief, as in Q. 3:186, Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your \npossessions and in yourselves.26 Wealth and offspring are the means used by God to \npunish the unbelievers in this life, so that their souls may perish in the denial of God \n(Q. 9:55, Let not their wealth nor their children dazzle thee: in reality God\u2019s wish is \nto punish them with these thing in this life, and that their souls may perish in their \n[very] denial of God); believers must be aware at all times that their possessions and \nprogeny are but a temptation and a test (fitna), and that it is God with whom their \ngreatest reward lies (Q. 8:28, know ye that your possessions and your progeny are \nbut a trial: and that it is God with whom lies your highest reward). \n64 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \nOne consequence of the recasting of m\ufffdl as the means of divine trial is the \nappearance in the Medinan ayas of two important, closely-related concepts \nconcerning the proper use of wealth. One of these is the notion of spending one\u2019s \nwealth \u2018in God\u2019s cause\u2019; the other is the belief that one\u2019s wealth becomes purified \nwhen at least a portion of it is reserved for charitable giving.27 The Muslims of \nMedina are left in no doubt that any wealth they have is given to them by God and \ncannot be disposed of as they see fit. They are, for example, to spend out of their \n\u2018substance\u2019 (m\ufffdl) on their kinfolk, orphans, the needy, the wayfarer, \u2018those who ask\u2019, \nand for the ransom of slaves (Q. 2:177). Muslim males now become obligated to \nspend of their wealth on dowries when marrying, and on financial support for their \nwives thereafter (Q. 4:24 and 34). Protection of the wealth of orphans is given \nspecial consideration, and Muslims are instructed how to deal financially with the \nfatherless children in their care (Q. 4:2, 5 and 6). These prescriptions are issued \nagainst a backdrop of enjoinders regarding the misuse of the things in one\u2019s \npossession: one\u2019s wealth is no longer to be wasted on \u2018vanities\u2019, or on bribes given \nin order to gain access to the wealth of others (Q. 2:188); wealth given away to \ncharity is wasted wealth if one ruins one\u2019s action by reminding others of one\u2019s \nlargesse (Q. 2:264), and so on. And at all times, the Muslims are advised not to let \ntheir wealth or their children divert them from the remembrance of God: O ye who \nbelieve! Let not your riches or your children divert you from the remembrance of \nGod! If any act thus, surely they are the losers (Q. 63:9). \nIn the Medinan ayas, then, wealth becomes something which the Muslims must \nconsecrate if they are to avoid the danger of \u2018wealth-pride\u2019 which so beleaguers the \n\u2018unregenerate man\u2019 portrayed in the Meccan ayas. Nowhere is this felt more acutely \nthan in those ayas which extol the virtue of \u2018striving\u2019 (jih\ufffdd) in God\u2019s cause with \none\u2019s possessions (amw\ufffdl) and one\u2019s own person.28 The muh\ufffdjir\u00fcn are held up as \nexemplars on a number of occasions, and Muslims are exhorted to follow their \npattern of belief (\u0131m\ufffdn), exile (hijra) and striving (jih\ufffdd) to the extent they are able: \nthose who believe, suffer exile and strive with their goods and persons have the \nhighest rank in the sight of God (see, for example, Q. 9:20, Those who believe, and \nemigrate and strive with might and main, in God\u2019s cause, with their goods and their \npersons, have the highest rank in the sight of God: they are the people who will \nachieve [salvation]). Indeed, it is explicitly stated in Q. 9:111 that God has \n\u2018purchased\u2019 from the believers their persons and their goods (amw\ufffdl): they fight for \nhis sake and, while they may lose their lives in the process, they will be given a most \nwonderful reward: eternal life in Paradise itself. \nThe Enigma of Q. 104:3 \nThe fulcrum upon which our reassessment of m\ufffdl rests here is the unequivocal \nstatement made in Q. 104:3, namely that some men believe that their wealth will \nenable them to live forever: \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 65 \nWoe to every [kind of] scandal-monger and-backbiter, who pileth up \nwealth and layeth it by, thinking that his wealth would make him last \nfor ever! (Q. 104:1\u20133). \nUnsurprisingly, the largely paraphrastic nature of classical exegesis means that it is \nable to shed little light on the depth psychology of wealth-pride, particularly insofar \nas it concerns longings for immortality. Al-\u2021abar\u0131, for example, says that the wealth-\nproud believe in the power of their accumulated wealth to grant them immortality in \nthis world;29 Ibn Kath\u0131r and al-Qur\u2020ub\u0131 are of the same opinion.30 Al-Zamakhshar\u0131 \noffers a little more elaboration. The accumulation of wealth, he opines, often results \nin heedlessness and over-inflated hopes and dreams; gradually, one\u2019s immersion in \nthe luxuries of life leads one to believe that wealth and riches will keep one alive \nforever.31 He goes on to say that the aya may also be an allusion to the fact that it is \nonly righteous action that can secure immortality: the doer of good deeds will be \nremembered forever in this world, while partaking of eternal life in the world to \ncome.32 Fakhr al-D\u0131n al-R\ufffdz\u0131 comes to a similar conclusion, adding that the use of \nthe past tense akhlada (ya\u02dbsabu anna m\ufffdlahu akhladahu) shows that in the mind of \nthe wealth-proud man, immortality and exemption from death are taken as given. \nHowever, such a man needs to work hard to protect his wealth from diminution, \nsimply in order to remain alive; consequently, his accumulation of wealth must be \nceaseless.33 \nEarly modern and contemporary exegetes generally tend not to stray too far from the \ninterpretations of their classical counterparts with regard to Q. 104:3: the ceaseless \naccumulation of m\ufffdl is seen as both a cause and a symptom of man\u2019s tendency to \nneglect truth, one result of which is the erroneous belief that one\u2019s wealth will buy \none immunity from death and allow one, in some way, shape or form, to live \nforever.34 \nThat wealth is a symbol of immortality in the mindset of some is, then, clear from \nboth the Qur\u2019anic text and the explanations of the exegetes. However, for insight \ninto precisely why it should be a symbol of everlasting life, and how this symbology \nworks in practice, I believe that we need to look outside the classical Muslim \nscholarly tradition and view the question from a social scientific perspective. To this \nend, we shall take our cue from the theoretical framework supplied by, inter alios, \nthe cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, and in particular his writings on dominant \nimmortality ideologies. \nErnest Becker and the Theory of \u2018Immortality Striving\u2019 \nAs a cultural anthropologist, Ernest Becker was searching for explanations of why \nhuman society develops in the way that it does; his particular focus of interest was \nwhy human society is so aggressive, and why different social groups are so \n66 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \nintolerant of each other. Drawing on his background in psychology, and inspired by \na wide range of thinkers such as Otto Rank, Norman O. Brown and S\u00f8ren \nKierkegaard, Becker concluded towards the end of his life that he had discovered a \nsimple yet exceedingly important explanatory principle for comprehending the \npsycho-dynamics which underpin all human culture. His main ideas, summarised \nwith extreme brevity, are as follows.35 \nAccording to Becker, all men want to endure and prosper, and in some sense achieve \npermanence. However, the existential dilemma that we face is that we are mortal. \nAwareness of our mortality brings with it an overwhelming anxiety that must be \nmasked if we are to function in the world. To suppress this awareness, we participate \nin projects of immortality, which, Becker assures us, we pursue all the time. All \nsocieties and cultures, he asserts, are based on dominant immortality ideologies \u2013 \nthose shared by the largest number of people in the group. Within these ideologies \nthere are sub-dominant ideologies as well, which means that at any point in history, a \nculture may be analysed as a complex system of countless different immortality \ngames and strategies, sanctioned by the dominant ideology and presented to the \npeople within that culture so that they may maintain the illusion of individual and \ncollective immortality. \nThe strategies employed in order to overcome mortality anxiety are numerous, but \ntend to fall into two main categories. The first is the desire for individuation and the \nconcomitant endeavour to acquire personal immortality, even at the expense of \nothers. This strategy engenders the illusion that one is transcending human \ncreatureliness by standing out above the rest. The second strategy is to find one\u2019s \nsymbolic immortality in yielding to the overarching strategy of the group or \ncommunity in which one is embedded. Examples of immortality strategies from \nhistory will inevitably be amalgams of these two types. What all strategies have in \ncommon is the creation of \u2018immortality symbols\u2019 with which people identify \nthemselves and through which society as a whole, and individuals in particular, are \nable to achieve symbolic immortality. The concatenation of immortality symbols and \nthe strategies used to maintain them form what Becker refers to as the causa-sui \nproject, or the means by which individuals and societies create the \u2018vital lie\u2019 \nnecessary for their own self-deception.36 \nThe creation of the \u2018vital lie\u2019 in pre-modern society, which is where our interest lies, \nis described in Becker\u2019s final work, Escape From Evil.37 There, Becker paints a \nbroad-brush picture of the evolution of immortality ideologies from prehistory to \nmodernity. Beginning with primitive man, he shows how the immortality motive \ngave rise to ritual and sacrifice, both of which were seen as techniques to promote \nand maintain the flow of life-power through the group. Ritual and sacrifice did not \nnecessarily guarantee the perpetuation of the individual in the physical realm, but \nthey were means by which the continuation of existence in the realm of the spirits \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 67 \nmight be assured. The centrality of ritual to the primitive Weltanschauung cannot be \noverestimated, for it was through ritual that man was able to both give and control \nlife-power itself. Ritual is a means of organising life and, as such, has to be carried \nout according to a particular \u2018theory of prosperity\u2019 \u2013 a way of encouraging or \ninducing nature to give more life to the tribe.38 With archaic man, the theory of \nprosperity was for the most part elemental and organic, with man looking to nature \nto see where the power came from. Principles of fecundity and generation were \nabstracted and then embodied through impersonation, with man taking on the role of \nthe elements. The cosmos was divided conceptually into the heavens and the earth, \nwith all prosperity deemed to emanate from the orderly interaction between the two. \nThe interplay of the heavens and the earth, like the interplay between the sexes, was \none of a number of interdependent polarities which characterised the worldview of \narchaic man. These opposing yet complementary principles \u2013 right and left; light and \ndark; power and weakness \u2013 enabled primitive man to see reality \u2018in the round\u2019 in \norder to control it. Death was part of this, and had to be embodied by primitive man \nin order to be controlled.39 \nKey to primitive ritual was the act of sacrifice, which was designed not only to \nrenew creation but also to anchor its practitioners in the invisible dimension of \nreality, creating a mystical, essential self that had superhuman powers. Man\u2019s social \nrepresentation of nature took place through the twin processes of \u2018macrocosmisation\u2019 \nand \u2018microcosmisation\u2019.40 In the former, man inflated his own importance to cosmic \nproportions by seeing every part of his own self as having a correspondence in the \nmacrocosm. In the latter, man humanised the cosmos by projecting earthly \nphenomena onto the heaven: with the transference of animals to heaven through the \ncreation of the zodiac, for example, mundane human affairs were given a timeless \nand superhuman validity. The stars came to preside over destiny and man became \nthe centre of all things. In this way, man humanised the heavens and sacralised the \nearth, thus fusing the two into a unity. Through this opposition of culture with \nnature, man arrogated to himself a special spiritual destiny which allowed him to \ntranscend his animality and gain a special status in the cosmic scheme of things. No \nlonger was he just a biped that hunts, eats and dies, but a being of importance and \nconsequence who was able to give eternal life to himself by means of shared socio-\nreligious rituals based on the principle of cosmic regeneration. Everything depended \non the prescribed ritual, which was deemed to put one in possession of eternity \nthrough unity with the sacrifice. Primitive life was not just a matter of the quest for \nmore life-power in this realm; it was also a quest for immortality. \nThe sacrificial ritual, then, was concerned with the attraction of power. Becker \ndescribes how the original sacrifice was almost always food, since food is what men \nneeded from the gods as the basis of life.41 Moreover, if food contains power, it \nalways signifies something more than itself: it possesses a mysterious inner essence \n68 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \nor spirit. When archaic man gave food as gifts, he was giving a piece of life itself: \nthe gifts given by primitive men to each other possessed mana power, or the essence \nof supernatural life. Through mutual gift-giving, the cycle of power between giver \nand receiver was perpetuated. Through offering gifts to each other, and to the gods, \nthe stream of life was kept running: the more one gave, the more one received. \nTaking his cue from Hocart, Becker sees in primitive man\u2019s sacrificial offerings the \norigins of trade.42 For gifts were given not only to one\u2019s own gods, but also to the \ngods of one\u2019s kinsmen. This led to the exchange of goods between different groups \nand, by extension, the direct motive of the creation of surplus for the sake of \nexchange. This exchange began quite simply as a contest, determining who could \ngive most to the gods of their kinsmen. The more one gave, the more life force was \nreleased, thus adding to one\u2019s cosmic heroism and self-esteem. One becomes a hero \nin the eyes of the gods as well as the eyes of men: one acquires mana power. In gift-\ngiving and sacrifice, therefore, one sees what Roheim refers to as \u2018narcissistic \ncapitalism\u2019 \u2013 the equation of wealth with magical power.43 The surplus created, and \noften offered to the gods in great piles of food and other goods, has its function in \nterms of the power it signifies. As Becker points out, man\u2019s existential insecurity \npropels him to accumulate things beyond his needs precisely because he realises how \ninsecure he actually is. Man\u2019s need to accumulate a surplus, then, was driven by his \nfundamental need to overcome the limitations of the human condition and achieve \nvictory over impotence, finitude and, by extension, death itself.44 \nWith the creation of surplus came the emergence of inequality, and Becker shows \nhow those individuals who came to embody the invisible world \u2013 the shamans, the \nguardians of the altar, the possessors of the ritual techniques \u2013 were able gradually to \ncommand the same authority over other men as was accorded to the spirits and the \ngods themselves. The power of the invisible world as embodied in certain figures \nallowed them to hold other men in their thrall. Instead of seeking a hero among the \ndead, man was now able to find him among the living, in the person of the power \nfigure. The power figure was traditionally the individual who excelled in some way \nover his fellows, and who consequently appeared to possess an extra \u2018charge of \npower\u2019 or mana from the invisible realm.45 The power figure was both respected and \nfeared, for he was nothing less than an isthmus which linked the visible to the \ninvisible world. Furthermore, he was almost invariably the figure responsible for the \nredistribution of surplus wealth in society, thus combining spiritual stature with \neconomic power. \nAll power, then, is sacred power because it derives from the desire for immortality. \nAnd it culminates in the willing subjection of men to people and objects which \nembody that immortality power. Sacredness is thus seen to inhere in individuals, \nwho are able to hold others in their thrall by a form of enchantment. Men bow down \nto such figures, Becker argues, because they treat them as objects of transference. \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 69 \nThey take their hopes and needs, their desires and their fears, and then project them \nonto certain objects or individuals to which they can then yield, and in which they \ncan find justification for their own \u2018immortality project\u2019. Wealth, as we shall see, is \none such object, while the possessor of wealth is another.46 \nThe m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl Verses Reappraised \nWe will begin our reappraisal by looking at several key passages which deal with the \nfetishisation of wealth and power; we will then focus more closely on the  \nQur\u2019anic treatment of the causa-sui project as reflected in the \u2018garden parable\u2019 in  \nQ. 18:32\u201344. \nA common thread linking a number of prophetic experiences recorded in the Qur\u2019an \nis the refusal of addressee communities to embrace as prophets those who are visibly \nlacking in wealth and connections. The encounter between Noah and his people \nstands out in this regard: \nNoah said: \u2018O my Lord! They have disobeyed me, but they follow \n[men] whose wealth (m\ufffdl) and children give them no increase but \nonly loss. And they have devised a tremendous plot. And they have \nsaid to each other, \u201cAbandon not your gods: abandon neither Wadd \nnor Suw\ufffdfi, neither Yagh\u00fcth nor Yafi\u00fcq, nor Nasr\u201d\u2019 (Q. 71:21\u20133). \nNoah\u2019s invocation comes at the end of a prophetic mission characterised by its \nalmost total lack of success. In an earlier passage, he complains to God that he has \ncalled to his people night and day, both in public and in private, but with little effect: \nevery time he has called to them they have thrust their fingers into their ears, \ncovered themselves up with their garments, grown obstinate, and given themselves \nup to arrogance (Q. 71:7). Preferring the \u2018beyond\u2019 of the dominant immortality \nideology which underpins their particular cultural structures to the alien \u2018beyond\u2019 \nposited by the hapless Noah, they continue to rebuke him until they are overcome by \nthe Flood. \nThe prophet Shufiayb undergoes a similar experience. Having received his call from \nGod, he invites his people to monotheism, to honest commercial dealing, and to \ntolerance with regard to those who believe in God. Their response is typical of most \nof the addressee communities in the Qur\u2019an: \nThey said: \u2018O Shufiayb! Does thy [religion of] prayer command thee \nthat we leave off the worship which our fathers practised, or that we \nleave off doing what we like with our property (amw\ufffdl)? Truly, thou \nart the one that forbeareth with faults and is right-minded!\u2019 \n(Q. 11:87). \n70 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \nShufiayb had invited his community to forego idolatry and commit themselves to one \nGod only; he also counselled honesty in all economic dealings, and tolerance with \nregard to those who wished to follow the monotheistic creed. In return, his \ncommunity attempted to stone him, and might have succeeded had they not been \nvisited with a cataclysmic earthquake which killed all but Shufiayb and his \nfollowers.47 \nIn both cases, the concerns of the addressee community hinge on the twin issues of \nidols and wealth. Noah\u2019s community is portrayed as being in thrall of those who are \nrich in possessions and offspring; Shufiayb\u2019s people are worried that they will be \nforced to relinquish their ancestral customs and not be allowed to dispose of their \nwealth as they think fit. The \u2018codified hero system\u2019 is in both cases wealth-driven \nand sanctioned by both the invisible gods they have constructed and the visible \nembodiments of prosperity \u2013 the rich elders of society \u2013 that their cultural systems \nhave created. The customs of the ancients and the wealth embodied by the leaders of \nsociety are important not in themselves but as conduits for the flow of power.48 As \nBecker puts it:49 \nPower is the life pulse that sustains man in every epoch, and unless \nthe student understands power figures and power sources he can \nunderstand nothing vital about social history. The history of man\u2019s \n\u2018fall\u2019 into stratified society can be traced around the figures of his \nheroes, to whom he is beholden for the power he wants most \u2013 to \npersevere as an organism, to continue experiencing. \nTo \u2018continue experiencing\u2019 is a corollary of the need for self-expansion and the \nhunger for durability. Power \u2013 and allegiance to the sources of power \u2013 may thus be \nsaid to lie at the heart of unregenerate man\u2019s quest for immortality. In primitive \nsocieties, invisible power flowed from the pool of ancestors and spirits, just as today \nit resides in technology. In the nascent stratified societies exemplified by the \ncommunities of Noah and Shufiayb, invisible power is concretised in the form of \nvisible wealth. Furthermore, it is wealth that offers not only the promise of \nimmortality, but immunity from any punishment that the God of the prophets \nthreatens to visit upon them in return for their intransigence: \nThey said: \u2018We have more in wealth (amw\ufffdl) and in sons, and we \ncannot be punished\u2019 (Q. 34:35). \nThe importance of visible manifestations of power may become a little clearer when \nwe consider the experience of Moses. Moses is portrayed as facing problems not \ndissimilar to those of Noah and Shufiayb: \nMoses prayed: \u2018Our Lord! Thou hast indeed bestowed on Pharaoh \nand his chiefs splendour and wealth (amw\ufffdl) in the life of the present, \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 71 \nand so, our Lord, they mislead [men] from Thy Path. Deface our \nLord, the features of their wealth (amw\ufffdl), and send hardness to their \nhearts, so they will not believe until they see the grievous penalty\u2019  \n(Q. 10:88). \nIn the person of Pharaoh, Becker sees the culmination of a long psychological \nprocess: the move from allegiance to the invisible gods of the spirit world, through \nthe fashioning of images and idols, to the establishment and worship of visible gods \non earth. The contemporaneity of this move with the change from an economy of \nsharing among equals to one of pooling of resources via a high-ranked and powerful \nauthority figure suggests that the two are inextricably linked. \nAt the level of the \u2018equalitarian society\u2019 posited by Paul Radin \u2013 the level of simple \nhunter-gatherer tribes \u2013 the wellbeing of the social group is achieved through a \nprocess of reciprocal exchange, with goods being traded freely among the group. In \nthe \u2018rank society\u2019 described by Hocart, however, the economic process changes. \nNow, the flow of goods is directed to a distinct centre of power \u2013 a figure of \nauthority \u2013 who receives the fruits of the group\u2019s labours and redistributes them. \nThis redistribution is, in theory, in accordance with need, but over time is carried out \nincreasingly by the leader\u2019s own fiat, hence the susceptibility of the process to \ncorruption.50 \nThe reasons behind the move from equalitarian to rank society are, of course, \nextremely complex and beyond the scope of this paper. One reason posited by \nBecker, however, demands our attention:51 \nWhy did people go from an economy of simple sharing among equals \nto one of pooling via an authority figure who has a high rank and \nabsolute power? The answer is that man wanted a visible god always \npresent to receive his offerings, and for this he was willing to pay the \nprice of his own subjection. \nA god that can see, be seen and respond is always preferred since he is able to \nvisibly accept the group\u2019s offerings, thus leaving them in no doubt that they are \nfavoured \u2013 hence the historical eagerness of leaderless tribes to acquire a chief \u2018as \nsoon as they could find a nobleman whose high rank or age gave hopes that he \nwould be acceptable to the spirits\u2019.52 One of the reasons that the Jews were mocked, \nBecker contends, was that they had no image of their god, who must have seemed \nlike the product of delusional thinking when compared to the Pharaoh in all his \nglory: a living, breathing, visibly wealthy and powerful god-king who, as prime \nobject of transference, becomes the embodiment of all of the invisible powers in the \ncosmos. \nTo explain man\u2019s willingness to subject himself with such alacrity to these god-king \nfigures, Becker invokes the twin principles of microcosmisation and \n72 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \nmacrocosmisation: the processes whereby man entwines his own destiny with that of \nthe cosmos by bringing the heavens down into his own ambit while simultaneously \nblowing himself up into the central concern of the cosmos. In primitive \ncommunities, the performance of ritual had served to enact the struggle between life \nand death, light and darkness; through the ritual offering of the sacrifice, primitive \nman endeavoured to invoke the invisible powers of the cosmos in order to enhance \nhis visible well-being and prosperity. With the advent of figures such as the pharaoh, \nhowever, the whole of this cosmological drama is summed up in the person of the \ngod-king himself:53 \nHe is the god who receives offerings, the protagonist of light against \ndark, and the embodiment of the invisible forces of nature \u2013 \nspecifically the sun. In Hocart\u2019s happy phrase, he is the \u2018Sun-Man\u2019. \nDivine kingship sums up the double process of macro- and \nmicrocosmization: it represents a \u2018solarization of man, and a \nhumanizing of the sun\u2019. \nFor early man, Becker argues, the light and heat from the sun were seen as \u2018the \narchetypes of all mysterious power\u2019, and the invisible source responsible for the \ngrowth and vibrancy of all life on earth. Consequently, once man came to equate the \ngod-king with the sun, these two become conflated: as a result, man comes to believe \nthat the god-king can actually vivify the earth. At the very mention of the pharaoh\u2019s \nname, the words \u2018health\u2019, \u2018prosperity\u2019 and \u2018life\u2019 would also be invoked.54 Given that \nthese words embody the end result of man\u2019s immortality striving, it is not difficult to \ncomprehend the ease with which god-king was able to hold men in his thrall: \nThen [Pharaoh] collected [his men] and made a proclamation, \nsaying, \u2018I am your Lord, Most High\u2019 (Q. 79:23\u20134). \nThe god-king, for his part, achieves his own heroic apotheosis by claiming divinity, \nwhile his subjects bask in his reflected \u2013 and immortal \u2013 glory. \nIn the person of Solomon, we see the disavowal of wealth as a symbol of social \nesteem and cultural greatness by one who himself was blessed with a whole \nkingdom. \nNow when [the embassy] came to Solomon, he said: \u2018Will ye give me \nabundance in wealth (m\ufffdl)? But that which God has given me is \nbetter than that which He has given you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in \nyour gift!\u2019 (Q. 27:36). \nQuestioning the exchange of gifts that is customary between visiting dignitaries and \ntheir hosts, Solomon tells the delegation from Sheba that although the Queen would \nshower him with riches, that which God has given \u2013 belief and eternal life \u2013 is far \nbetter. Despite the fact that Solomon was a king in his own right, he desisted from \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 73 \nentering a relationship that was mediated from the outset by considerations of wealth \nand status. Like all social ceremonials, gift-giving can seen as another example of a \n\u2018joint theatrical staging whose purpose it is to sustain and create meaning for all its \nmembers\u2019.55 The denigration of the gift is of significance here because it signals \nSolomon\u2019s refusal to enhance the cultural meaning which shores up the identity of \nthe Queen of Sheba. If the encounter is to have any meaning for him, it must be on \nterms not dictated by the \u2018vital lie\u2019 she is trying to perpetuate through the ritual of \ngift-giving, but by the word of God and the promise of real rather than symbolic \nimmortality. \nAs the Qur\u2019an shows, it is not only his prophets whom unregenerate man expects to \nembody wealth and prosperity. The valorisation of wealth as the qualification par \nexcellence for political leadership is also highlighted: \nTheir Prophet said to them: \u2018God hath appointed \u2021\ufffdl\u00fct as king over \nyou.\u2019 They said: \u2018How can he exercise authority over us when we are \nbetter fitted than he to exercise authority, and he is not even gifted, \nwith wealth (m\ufffdl) in abundance?\u2019 He said: \u2018God hath chosen him \nabove you, and hath gifted him abundantly with knowledge and \nbodily prowess: God granteth His authority to whom He pleaseth. \nGod careth for all, and He knoweth all things\u2019 (Q. 2:247). \nThe people over whom \u2021\ufffdl\u00fct \u2013 the Biblical king Saul \u2013 was appointed complain that \nhe is not a suitable candidate for kingdom on account of the fact that he lacks wealth \nin abundance. For them, the most important criterion is not the possession of \nleadership skills but the possession of conspicuous wealth: how can a king be a king \nif, as in the case of Saul, he hails from the smallest tribe in Israel and has few \npossessions to his name? For unregenerate man, a king can be a king only if he is \nable to embody the aspirations to greatness of the people over whom he rules. \nThe \u2021\ufffdl\u00fct narrative also gives us important insights into the group psychology of the \naddressee communities on account of the perspective it opens up on the issue of \npower itself, and why men willingly subject themselves to the authority of others. As \nBecker says:56 \nWhy are groups so blind and stupid? \u2013 men have always asked. \nBecause they demand illusions, answered Freud, they \u2018constantly give \nwhat is unreal precedence over what is real\u2019. And we know why. The \nreal world is simply too terrible to admit; it tells man that he is a \nsmall, trembling animal who will decay and die. Illusion changes all \nthis, makes man seem important, vital to the universe, immortal in \nsome way. Who transmits this illusion, if not the parents by imparting \nthe macro-lie of the cultural causa-sui? The masses look to the \nleaders to give them just the untruth they need \u2026 \n74 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \nThe \u2018untruth\u2019 here is the Beckerian \u2018vital lie\u2019 in which men need to feel embedded in \norder to function. For unregenerate man, the ideal leader is one who can act as their \nobject of transference, and under whose aegis they can act out their own individual \ncausa-sui projects. There appears to be little, if any, substantial difference between \nideals of kingship in the mindset of the people of Saul and that of primitive man. If \nprimitive man deferred to the privileges and authority of others, it was because they \nsecured life and assured the perpetuation of the tribe. The great heroes of the tribe \nwere able to display trophies which reflected their immortality power; to identify \nwith the great is to soak up some of their greatness for oneself. Becker reminds us \nthat the basic function of the hero in history is to gamble with life and defy death, \nand if men pledge allegiance to him, or worship his memory, it is precisely because \nhe embodies the triumph over what they fear the most: annihilation and death.57 The \npeople rejected Saul because he lacked the very thing they deemed necessary for the \nattainment of heroic apotheosis and the perpetuation of their own particular \u2018vital \nlie\u2019: wealth, and the power that it signifies. \nThe Qur\u2019an and the causa-sui Project \nThe consequences that \u2018wealth-pride\u2019 may have for man in both this world and the \nnext are delineated clearly in a number of ayas. Significant in this regard are a \nnumber of parabolic passages in which unregenerate man\u2019s cultivation of the earthly \ngarden can be seen in a very Beckerian sense to serve as a physical representation of \nthe causa-sui project that is always doomed to failure. \nThe most striking of these appears in S\u00fcrat al-Kahf. It concerns two men, one of \nwhom has been blessed with gardens and orchards that produce abundant fruits and \ngrains. The owner of the gardens surveys his bountiful harvest and, in the course of a \n\u2018mutual argument\u2019, boasts to his companion that he is superior to him in terms of the \nwealth (m\ufffdl) he enjoys and the honour (fiizza) accorded to him by other men. Later, \nhe enters his garden in a state [of mind] unjust to his soul and declares his belief that \nhis possessions will never perish. Even if there is a day of judgement, he asserts, and \nhe is brought back to his Lord, he is sure that he will surely find there something \nbetter in exchange (Q. 18:34\u20136). \nAt this point, his companion questions the garden owner\u2019s behaviour and cautions \nhim against placing trust in things other than God: \n\u2018Dost thou deny Him Who created thee out of the dust, then out of a \nsperm drop, then fashioned thee into a man? But [I think] for my part \nthat He is God, My Lord, and none shall I associate with my Lord. \nWhy didst thou not, as thou goeth into thy garden, say: \u201cGod\u2019s Will \n[be done]! There is no power but from God!\u201d If thou dost see me less \nthan thee in wealth and sons (m\ufffdlan wa-waladan), it may be that my \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 75 \nLord will give me something better than thy garden, and that He will \nsend on thy garden thunderbolts [by way of reckoning] from heaven, \nmaking it [but] slippery sand! (Q. 18:37\u201340). \nTwo ayas later, and the companion\u2019s predictions are realised: the garden is destroyed \nand its owner is left distraught, twisting and turning his hands over what he had \nspent on his property and wishing that he had never ascribed partners to God \n(Q. 18:42). \nThe parable is evocative of the Beckerian thesis in a number of ways. Firstly, there is \nwhat appears to be a direct link made between the possession of wealth and the \nability to command self-esteem: \u2018More wealth (m\ufffdl) have I than you, and more \nhonour and power in [my following of] men\u2019 (Q. 18:34). For the garden owner, the \nexistence of an abundant garden is not important for what it is in itself, but for its \nsymbolic significance, for its ability to both project his own power and attract the \npower of others. And power, the key to durability, is what lies at the heart of all \nimmortality striving. As Becker points out \u2018each person nourishes his immortality in \nthe ideology of self-perpetuation to which he gives his allegiance; this gives his life \nthe only abiding significance it can have\u2019.58 The \u2018ideology of self-perpetuation\u2019 to \nwhich one gives one\u2019s allegiance \u2013 the project of \u2018self-creation\u2019 or causa-sui \u2013 \nchanges according to epoch and cultural context. In order to deny that he is \npowerless and cannot stand alone, man projects his hopes and fears onto a project \u2013 \nany project \u2013 which embodies the power that he lacks but so obviously needs. This \nact of transference can involve almost anything:59 \nIt need not be overtly a god or openly a stronger person, but it can be \nthe power of an all-absorbing activity, a passion, a dedication to a \ngame, a way of life, that like a comfortable web keeps a person \nbuoyed up and ignorant of himself, of the fact that he does not rest on \nhis own center. All of us are driven to be supported in a self-forgetful \nway, ignorant of what energies we really draw on, of the kind of lie \nwe have fashioned in order to live securely and serenely. Augustine \nwas a master analyst of this, as were Kierkegaard, Scheler, and Tillich \nin our day. They saw that man could strut and boast all he wanted, but \nthat he really drew his \u2018courage to be\u2019 from a god, a string of sexual \nconquests, a Big Brother, a flag, the proletariat, and the fetish of \nmoney and the size of a bank balance. \nSecondly, that the subject of wealth-pride is an individual and the object of his \nhubris a garden resonates with the larger picture painted by Becker of the move from \nRadin\u2019s \u2018equalitarian society\u2019 to Hocart\u2019s \u2018rank society\u2019. As the advent of agriculture \nbegan the break-up of the primitive world, the rise of the early states and the focus of \norganised society on the twin institutions of kingship and the patriarchal family \n76 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \nmeant that the dynamics which underpin the larger socio-cultural causa-sui project \nbegin to change. In primitive society, the whole group had created mana power by \nmeans of jointly celebrated ritual. In the new \u2018rank society\u2019, it is the king who \nrepresents the new locus of spiritual power from which the subjects take succour. \nPreviously, each person had helped to exercise control over the cosmos through \nshared ritual; now, all the individual can do is imitate the king in order to re-enact \nthe divine plan in his own domain, in much the same way that primitive ritualism, \nthrough the setting up of the altar and the act of sacrifice, was able to re-enact in \nminiature the drama of the whole cosmos. In this way, the individual in Hocart\u2019s \n\u2018rank society\u2019 is able to receive a reflection of the king\u2019s powers and achieve the \nrespect and esteem he feels he deserves.60 \nThirdly, the garden parable illustrates the tension which exists between the twin \nontological motives which, for Becker, inform all human actions. On the one hand, \nman is attracted toward the \u2018rightness\u2019 of beauty, goodness and perfection and \npushes himself to expand in order to attain these, impelled as he is \u2018by a powerful \ndesire to identify with the cosmic process, to merge himself with the rest of nature\u2019. \nThe urge to immortality that is projected onto the object of transference is not a \nsimple reaction to the underlying death-anxiety but also \u2018a reaching out by one\u2019s \nwhole being toward life\u2019. The cultivation of the garden, which represents nurture, \nexpansion, vibrancy and beauty, is also the cultivation of the agape side of man\u2019s \nnature.61 \nOn the other hand, man strives to be unique, to stand out as something different and \nexpress his individuality. If agape allows man to self-expand into unity with \ncreation, eros encourages him to self-expand in a way that highlights his \nindividuation and enables him to stand apart \u2013 and aloof \u2013 from others. Seen from \nthe perspective of this second ontological motive, the garden is not merely a \nreflection of all that is good; by dint of the fact that it is seen as one man\u2019s \npossession, it becomes the means through which he achieves self-esteem and, by \nextension, his own share of immortality. \nThe garden trope is of course key to our understanding of the Qur\u2019anic view of \nparadise, with the heavenly janna comprising the locus in the hereafter of everlasting \npeace, happiness and salvation. Yet it is in the Qur\u2019anic treatment of the worldly \ngarden \u2013 the janna cultivated by man here on earth, as in the preceding parable \u2013 that \nthe significance of the heavenly garden is thrown into sharp, Beckerian focus. On at \nleast half a dozen occasions, the earthly garden is depicted by the Qur\u2019an as the \nobject of transference upon which unregenerate man projects his desires for self-\nexpansion, the accumulation of mana power and, by extension, a share in the \neverlasting. On each of these occasions, man\u2019s faith in his own causa-sui project is \nshown to be futile as his garden \u2013 his heaven on earth \u2013 either perishes or is \ndestroyed.62 For the Qur\u2019an, man\u2019s cultivation of the earthly garden must be \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 77 \nsacralised as an act performed for the sake of God and in appreciation of the fact that \nnothing can take place without divine sanction.63 Earthly contentment is possible, in \nthe eyes of the Qur\u2019an, if man\u2019s cultivation of his \u2018garden\u2019 is mediated by belief and \ntrust in God. Man can have a garden on earth as long as he retains full awareness that \nhe is not the power behind its cultivation, and that it may be taken from him at any \nminute. In other words, he must, in order to live safely, be aware of the danger: he \nmust confront the possibility of death and destruction and yield to it. If he does not, \nand he creates his garden as a hubristic causa-sui project, nemesis is bound to \nfollow: \nSo his fruits [and enjoyment] were encompassed with ruin, and he \nremained twisting and turning his hands over what he had spent on \nhis property, which had [now] tumbled to pieces to its very \nfoundations. And he could only say, \u2018Woe is me! Would I had never \nascribed partners to my Lord and Cherisher!\u2019 (Q. 18:42). \nThe ever-present possibility that the earthly garden may be taken from man at any \nmoment illustrates what Becker describes as the ambivalence of the transference \nobject, which in turn is the source of man\u2019s perpetual disquietude. For, as he points \nout, man inevitably:64 \n\u2026 experiences \u2018transference terror\u2019; the terror of losing the object \u2026 \nof not being able to live without it. The terror of his own finitude and \nimpotence still haunts him, but now in the precise form of the \ntransference object. How implacably ironic is human life. The \ntransference object always looms larger than life size because it \nrepresents all of life and hence all of one\u2019s fate. The transference \nobject becomes the focus of the problem of one\u2019s freedom because \none is compulsively dependent on it; it sums up all other natural \ndependencies and emotions. \nConclusion \nHaving viewed a number of the amw\ufffdl verses under the microscope of the Beckerian \nthesis, certain tentative conclusions may now be drawn. As the \u2018rejection narratives\u2019 \nshow, the reach of the \u2018dominant immortality ideology\u2019 as outlined by Becker would \nseem to extend quite comfortably to the addressee communities that appear in the \nQur\u2019an. Moreover, its strictures on the dangers inherent in man\u2019s inordinate love of \nwealth, together with the insights it gives into the psycho-dynamics underpinning \nprophetic rejection, tend to suggest that Qur\u2019anic discourse on wealth is fuelled by \nwhat appears to be an uncannily prescient understanding of the causa-sui project in \nall but name. \n78 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \nAs its treatment of the numerous encounters between prophets and addressee \ncommunities shows, the Qur\u2019an portrays the pre-Mu\u02dbammadan world as one \npeopled by societies in which wealth and offspring represented the means par \nexcellence by which man might achieve heroic apotheosis. Becker shows how the \nideological capital which funded the construction of cultural facades and enabled \nthose who fashioned them to elevate themselves above death underwent a gradual \nevolution, from the dependence of primitive man on the invisible world of gods and \nancestral spirits to the creation, in later societies, of distinctly visible gods, idols and \nobjects as a conduit for man\u2019s offerings and a means of working out his aspirations \nfor immortality. Understandably, the Qur\u2019an does not compartmentalise man into the \nprimitive and post-primitive, and so does not trace this evolution with the same \nhistoriographical robustness as Becker.65 However, the conclusions that it draws are, \nmutatis mutandis, more or less the same. Unregenerate man \u2013 the addressee of divine \nrevelation \u2013 is in Qur\u2019anic terms a man whose causa-sui project is embedded in the \n\u2018life of the world\u2019. While this life has many different cultural manifestations, the \nmotive which carries it forward \u2013 the achievement of permanence through self-\nexpansion via things of this world \u2013 is the same. And at the heart of this self-\nexpansion lies the accumulation of wealth, in all of its infinite variety. \nThus, for unregenerate man, amw\ufffdl wa-awl\ufffdd (wealth and offspring) represent the \nmost tangible fruits of his heroic endeavour on earth. As such they become the \nmeasure by which the individual \u2013 and, more importantly, the power relationships \nwhich inform his cultural life \u2013 are measured; they become the guarantor of personal \nself-esteem and earthly felicity; and they become a source of immunity from the \npunishments that the prophets claim will be meted out to them as a result of their \nperceived intransigence. \u2018Wealth equals power\u2019 may be a clich\u00e9, but once one \napprehends that power is the conduit through which life \u2013 and, with it, immortality \u2013 \nflows, then the dynamics at play in the cultural life of unregenerate man become \ncomprehensible. \nThe Qur\u2019an, for its part, is uncompromising in its rejection of the pre-Mu\u02dbammadan \nfetishisation of \u2018wealth and offspring\u2019. However, wealth per se is no way denigrated \n\u2013 so long as it is sacralised by righteous intention and correct action. Whereas in \nprimitive societies, amw\ufffdl wa-awl\ufffdd were what one \u2018had\u2019, and what guaranteed \none\u2019s continuance after death, with the advent of the divinely-revealed religion, and \nparticularly in Islam, where it is more finely nuanced, offspring and possessions \ncontinue to be passports to eternity, but in a manner precisely reverse to that of the \n\u2018having\u2019 societies.66 The Qur\u2019an exhorts its listeners to be ready to sacrifice their \n\u2018offspring and possessions\u2019; to lend them as a metaphorical \u2018beautiful loan\u2019 which \nwill be repaid with profit by God in the life to come. This was a guarantee of eternity \nthat was won by having and giving, rather than having and keeping \u2013 and the \ntransaction was mediated not by power but by faith: trust in the divine promise. \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 79 \nGiven this, one may argue that social justice is a secondary concern of the Qur\u2019an, \nwhere it is seen as an adjunct \u2013 a necessary and automatic adjunct \u2013 of self-reform. \nMan\u2019s primary duty as adumbrated by the Qur\u2019an is, it would seem, to himself. \nWealth is not scorned because it is seen as the root of all social evil, but because it is \nsomething which, if not understood and appreciated properly, can enmesh man in the \nmire of \u2018worldly life\u2019 and obscure his connection with the Creator. From the ayas on \namw\ufffdl wa-ban\u00fcn, then, the Qur\u2019an emerges as a document intent on warning man \nnot against the social evils of misuse of wealth, but of the fact that by \nmisunderstanding the nature of wealth, man is imperilling his own future and the \npossibility of eternal life. This is, of course, in contradistinction to the belief of \nunregenerate man in wealth as the key to eternity, summed up in the aya \u2018\u2026 thinking \nthat his wealth would make him last forever\u2019. \nFrom the cultural anthropological perspective, then, it appears that not only do the \nQur\u2019anic narratives under scrutiny here enjoy consonance with Judaeo-Christian \nteachings on wealth, framing it squarely within the continuum of condemnatory \nteachings on the misuse of ownership found in all of the monotheistic traditions,67 \nbut also they appear to dovetail quite neatly with the theory of dominant immortality \nideology as adumbrated by a number of modern and near-contemporary social \ntheorists such as Rank, Brown and, of course, Becker himself. Becker appears to \nhave closed the circle on the issue of cultural hero-systems and the existential \ndilemma that man encounters on account of his \u2018individuality-within-finitude\u2019.68 \nHowever, whether his central thesis is applicable to the Qur\u2019anic approach to \nimmortality as a whole remains unclear: any judgement on the matter must be \nreserved until further, more extensive research has been carried out and a long-\nawaited Beckerian perspective on the Islamic revelation in its entirety has been \nestablished.69 \n \nNOTES \n1 Ernest Becker, Escape from Evil (New York: The Free Press, 1975), p. 75. \n2 The term \u2018addressee communities\u2019 here denotes those groups and nations in the Qur\u2019an to \nwhom prophets were sent and the message of monotheism communicated. \n3 Those passages in the Qur\u2019an which chronicle the unsuccessful attempts of the prophets to \nreach their own people are referred to here as the \u2018rejection narratives\u2019. \n4 W.

While these chronologies have substantial differences \nas far as the order of individual suras is concerned, on the issue of the Meccan or Medinan \norigin of the m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl verses under discussion here, they speak as one. For more on Muslim \nand Western attempts to establish a chronology of Qur\u2019anic revelation, see Robinson, \nDiscovering The Qur\u2019an, pp. 60\u201396. \n18 Locating the ayas chronologically in order to chart thematic progression is as a rule made \nmore difficult by the fact that a number of suras are clearly composite: some ayas revealed in \nMecca were inserted in Medinan suras \u2013 and vice versa \u2013 at the time of the fiUthm\ufffdnic \nrecension. The m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl verses do not appear to be among these. \n19 The precise statistical breakdown is as follows. Spread over 29 ayas, there are 30 \noccurrences of m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl in the Meccan phase of the revelation: m\ufffdl is mentioned 21 times \nand amw\ufffdl 9 times. In the Medinan phase of the revelation there are 56 occurrences of \nm\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl spread over 51 ayas: amw\ufffdl is mentioned 52 times and m\ufffdl 9 times. These include, \nof course, the various possessive forms such as m\ufffdluhu, amw\ufffdlukum, amw\ufffdluhum, and so on. \n20 The term \u2018unregenerate man\u2019 is used here as a convenient shorthand for \u2018unbelievers\u2019 \n(k\ufffdfir\u00fcn), \u2018hypocrites\u2019 (mun\ufffdfiq\u00fcn) and \u2018associationists\u2019 (mushrik\u00fcn), all of whom are \nexcoriated by the Qur\u2019an for their refusal to embrace the divine revelation. The term reflects \nthe Qur\u2019anic perspective and should not be construed as a value judgment on the part of the \nauthor of this paper. \n21 Statistically, the distribution of these different types of m\ufffdl\/amw\ufffdl verse across the \nMecca\/Medina divide is not without significance. Of the 29 Meccan ayas under scrutiny, 3 are \ndefinitional, 21 are condemnatory, and 5 are prescriptive. Of the 51 Medinan ayas, 15 are \ndefinitional, 14 are condemnatory and 22 prescriptive. The fact that the condemnatory-to-\nprescriptive ratio changes dramatically in the post-Hijr\u0131 revelations reflects the general \nincrease in the number of ethico-legal precepts which occurred in Medina as the Muslim \ncommunity took steps towards becoming a community-state or umma. \n22 Also: Q. 18:39\u201340, If thou dost see me less than thee in wealth and sons, it may be that my \nLord will give me something better; and Q. 18:46, Wealth and sons are allurements of the life \nof this world: but the things that endure, Good Deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord. \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 81 \n \n23 Also Q. 69:28, [He will say] \u2018Of no profit to me has been my wealth!\u2019; and Q. 92:11, Nor \nwill his wealth profit him when he falls headlong [into the Pit]. \n24 Q. 6:152 and Q. 17:34. \n25 Q. 51:19 and Q. 70:24. \n26 Also Q. 2:155, Be sure We shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in \ngoods, lives and the fruits [of your toil], but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere. \n27 The \u2018purification of wealth\u2019 aya \u2013 Q. 9:103, Of their wealth take alms, that so though might \npurify and sanctify them: and pray on their behalf. Verily thy prayers are a source of security \nfor them: and God is One who heareth and knoweth \u2013 foreshadows the institution of zak\ufffdt in \nthe later stages of the Prophet\u2019s Medinan career. \n28 This is of course no place to explore the multivalent nature of the word \u2018striving\u2019, which \ncannot be \u2013 and indeed never has been \u2013 restricted to jih\ufffdd in the military sense alone. \n29 Ab\u00fc Jafifar Mu\u02dbammad ibn Jar\u0131r al-\u2021abar\u0131, J\ufffdmifi al-bay\ufffdn (13 vols, Beirut: D\ufffdr al-Kutub \nal-fiIlmiyya, 1999), vol. 12, p. 688. \n30 Ibn Kath\u0131r, Tafs\u0131r al-Qur\u221a\ufffdn al-fia\u00f7\u0131m (4 vols, Beirut: D\ufffdr al-Mafirifa, n.d.), vol. 4, p. 586; \nfiAbd All\ufffdh Mu\u02dbammad ibn A\u02dbmad al-An\u00dfar\u0131 al-Qur\u2020ub\u0131, al-J\ufffdmifi li-a\u02dbk\ufffdm al-Qur\u221a\ufffdn (20 \nvols, Beirut: D\ufffdr I\u02dby\ufffd\u221a al-Tur\ufffdth al-fiArab\u0131, 1984), vol. 20, p. 184. \n31 Ab\u00fc\u2019l-Q\ufffdsim ibn fiUmar al-Zamakhshar\u0131, al-Kashsh\ufffdf (4 vols, Beirut: D\ufffdr al-Kit\ufffdb al-\nfiArab\u0131, 1987), vol. 4, p. 795. \n32 Al-Zamakhshar\u0131, al-Kashsh\ufffdf, vol. 4, p. 795. \n33 Fakhr al-D\u0131n al-R\ufffdz\u0131, al-Tafs\u0131r al-kab\u0131r (33 vols, Beirut: D\ufffdr al-Kutub al-fiIlmiyya, 2000), \nvol. 32, p. 88. \n34 See, for example, Ma\u02dbm\u00fcd Shih\ufffdb al-D\u0131n al-\u25cal\u00fcs\u0131, R\u00fc\u02db al-mafi\ufffdn\u0131 (16 vols, Beirut: D\ufffdr al-\nKutub al-fiIlmiyya, 1994), vol. 15, p. 461; Sayyid Mu\u02dbammad \u02d8usayn \u2021ab\ufffd\u2020ab\ufffd\u221a\u0131, Tafs\u0131r al-\nm\u0131z\ufffdn (20 vols, Tehran: Buny\ufffdd-i fiIlm\ufffd wa-Fikr\ufffd-i fiAll\ufffdma \u2021ab\ufffd\u2020ab\ufffd\u221a\u0131, 1984), vol. 20, \npp. 823\u20136. \n35 The main biographical source for Ernest Becker is R.

Sadly, Becker never enjoyed mainstream acceptance in the social sciences. \nNevertheless, his most famous work, the Pulitzer Prize winning The Denial of Death, remains \nin print over 30 years after its initial publication and Becker\u2019s death from cancer at the age of \n49. One possible reason for his relative obscurity in academic circles was his lack of a single \ndisciplinary home: his training, his academic posts and his scholarly output spanned \nanthropology, psychiatry, pedagogy and sociology, and inevitably in some quarters he was \nconsidered a jack-of-all-trades. Another reason is that much of his career was spent in the \nbackwaters of academe, a victim of the purge of radicals from American universities in the \nlate sixties and early seventies. \n36 For Becker\u2019s exposition of the conceptual ambivalence of the causa-sui project, see his The \nDenial of Death (New York: Free Press, 1997), pp. 119\u201323. The \u2018vital lie\u2019 refers to the \ndeliberate obfuscation of reality which man effects in order to shield himself from the anxiety \nof death and annihilation (see pp. 47\u201366). \n37 For publication details, see n. 1 above. \n38 Becker, Escape from Evil, p. 16. \n39 Becker, Escape from Evil, p. 17. \n40 Becker, Escape from Evil, p. 18. \n41 Becker, Escape from Evil, p. 29. \n82 Journal of Qur\u2019anic Studies \n \n42 Becker, Escape from Evil, pp. 30\u20131. \n43 Becker, Escape from Evil, pp. 30\u20131. \n44 Becker, Escape from Evil, pp. 30\u20131. \n45 Becker, Escape from Evil, p. 46. \n46 Becker\u2019s treatment of the rise of economic inequality, the emergence of money as the \u2018new \nuniversal immortality ideology\u2019 and the role of wealth-pride in the dynamics of \u2018social evil\u2019 is \nkey to his theory of immortality striving, particularly in the socio-cultural context of medieval \nand modern society. The scope of this paper does not allow us to discuss it here, however, and \nreaders are referred to chapters 4 to 8 of Escape from Evil. \n47 The story of Shufiayb is told in Q. 7:85\u201393.

Other \u2018earthly garden\u2019 ayas include Q. 2:266, Q. 17:91, \nQ. 25:8, Q. 26:58 and Q. 68:17\u201334. The last example in this list is particularly germane, since \nit deals with the tribulations of the \u2018People of the Garden\u2019 (a\u00df\u02db\ufffdb al-janna), whose refusal to \nacknowledge God as the true provider led to the destruction of their land by divine wrath and \ntheir concomitant loss of livelihood. \n63 In both Q. 18:39 and Q. 68:28 it is suggested that it is the hubris of the owners in their \nrefusal to acknowledge God\u2019s will which brings destruction upon their gardens. \n64 Becker, The Denial of Death, p. 146. \n65 That is not to say, however, that we cannot build up a picture of this change from the \nQur\u2019an itself. The earlier community of Abraham, for example, with its emphasis on idols, is \nin the tenor of its approach to the prophetic mission quite clearly distinguishable from, say, the \nlater community of Shufiayb or the followers of Pharaoh. \n66 The dichotomy of the \u2018having\u2019 and the \u2018being\u2019 modes of existence and societal behaviour is \none of the central planks of Erich Fromm\u2019s critique of modernity. See Erich Fromm, To Have \nor To Be? (London: Jonathan Cape, 1987). Chapters 4 to 7 (pp. 75\u2013132) are particularly \nenlightening with regard to the fundamental differences between these modes of existence. \n67 New Testament teachings on the dangers of wealth and wealth-pride abound. See, for \nexample, 1 Timothy 6:9\u201311, 17\u201319; Matthew 6:19\u201321; 16:26. \n68 Becker, The Birth and Death of Meaning, p. 146. \n Wealth as an Immortality Symbol in the Qur\u2019an 83 \n \n69 One of the criticisms levelled at Becker was that he was unable, or unwilling, to identify \nthe kind of cultural formation which would, to his mind at least, avoid the pitfalls and evils of \nthe dominant immortality ideologies which supposedly inform all human cultural endeavour. \nFor if history is merely the jostling for supremacy of rival immortality projects, as Becker \nseems to suggest, then who is to say which one is to be preferred? A definitive answer to this \nquestion is needed, not least because Becker uses the term \u2018authentic man\u2019 to describe the \nkind of individual who is able to achieve heroic apotheosis by embracing his own mortality \nand thus transcending the \u2018vital lie\u2019 which keeps the rest of society asleep. While Becker hints \non more than one occasion that \u2018authentic man\u2019 can achieve transcendence only through \nreligious faith, he fails to follow through by explaining at any great length the fundamental \ndifferences between the immortality offered by revealed religion and that offered by the \ndominant ideologies operating within human culture. \n"}
