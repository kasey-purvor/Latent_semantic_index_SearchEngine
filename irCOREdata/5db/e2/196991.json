The disease is endemic in 3 \nSoutheast Asia and Northern Australia and no effective vaccine exists. To describe 4 \nhuman cell-mediated immune responses to B. pseudomallei and to identify candidate 5 \nantigens for vaccine development, the ability of antigen-pulsed monocyte-derived 6 \ndendritic cells (moDCs) to trigger autologous T cell responses to B. pseudomallei and 7 \nits products was tested. MoDC were prepared from healthy individuals exposed or not 8 \nexposed to B. pseudomallei based on serological evidence. These were pulsed with 9 \nheat-killed B. pseudomallei or purified antigens including ABC transporters (LolC, 10 \nOppA and PotF), Bsa type III secreted proteins (BipD and BopE), tandem repeated 11 \nsequence proteins (Rp1 and Rp2), flagellin and heat shock proteins (Hsp60 and 12 \nHsp70) prior to mixing with autologous T cell populations. After pulsing with either 13 \nheat-killed B. pseudomallei or LolC or Rp2, co-culturing the antigen-pulsed moDC 14 \nwith T cells elicited interferon-gamma production of CD4+ T cells from seropositive 15 \ndonors at levels greater than seronegative donors. These antigens also induced 16 \ngranzyme B (cytotoxic) responses from CD8+ T cells. Activation of antigen-specific 17 \nCD4+ T cells required direct contact with moDC and is therefore not dependent on 18 \nsoluble mediators. Peptide epitopes of the Rp proteins recognized by T cells in 19 \nhealthy individuals were identified. Our study provides valuable novel data on the 20 \ninduction of human cell-mediated immune responses to B. pseudomallei and its 21 \nprotein antigens that may be exploited in the rational development of vaccines to 22 \ncombat melioidosis. 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n 4 \nIntroduction 1 \nBurkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacterium 2 \nthat causes melioidosis, a severe invasive disease that is endemic in Southeast Asia, 3 \nNorthern Australia and several other tropical regions (7, 32). Acute septic melioidosis 4 \nhas a high mortality rate in Northeast Thailand (approximately 50%), even in patients 5 \nthat receive appropriate antibiotics. Serological evidence, based on the indirect 6 \nhemagglutination assay (IHA), indicates that 80% of people living in endemic areas 7 \nhave been exposed to B. pseudomallei with no clinical symptoms and the prevalence 8 \nof positive serology increases with age (4, 9). Recurrent melioidosis can also occur 9 \neither as relapse after antibiotic treatment or re-infection (21). B. pseudomallei is 10 \nclassified as a NIAID category B potential agent for biological terrorism (24). The 11 \nmechanisms by which the organism evades the bactericidal effects of the host immune 12 \nresponse are not fully understood and there are no licensed vaccines at the time of 13 \nwriting. 14 \nRecently, we used a B. pseudomallei protein microarray to identify proteins of the 15 \norganism recognized by the human humoral immune system (13). However, 16 \ndevelopment of effective melioidosis vaccines also requires consideration of the cell-17 \nmediated immune response owing to intracellular persistence of the bacterium. In 18 \nanimal models, the crucial mediator of resistance to acute B. pseudomallei infection is 19 \nIFN-\u03b3 produced by multiple cell types  including NK cells, and both CD4 and CD8 T-20 \ncells (17, 20, 26). T-cell-mediated responses to some recombinant proteins of B. 21 \npseudomallei have been studied. Immunization of mice with a live-attenuated ilvI 22 \nmutant of B. pseudomallei (2D2), induced antigen-specific T-cells, including CD4+ T-23 \ncells that respond to proteins secreted by the Bsa type III secretion system (T3SS; 24 \nBopE and BipD) (16). B. pseudomallei 2D2-primed T-cells also recognize bacterial 25 \n 5 \nproteins of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, including LolC, PotF and OppA, 1 \nand respond by producing IFN-\u03b3 (18). In an assay to evaluate candidate vaccine 2 \nantigens, immunization of mice with adjuvant-mixed Bip proteins did not elicit 3 \nprotection against  B. pseudomallei infection (11, 27). However, antibodies to BipB, 4 \nBipC and BipD are detected in serum of melioidosis patients (11, 28). Further, a DNA 5 \nvaccine encoding the flagellin protein and CpG motifs enhanced resistance of 6 \nimmunized mice to B. pseudomallei (5, 6). Owing to the incomplete protection 7 \nafforded by candidate antigens to date, it is necessary to search for additional proteins 8 \nfor vaccine development. Tandem repeated sequence proteins of B. pseudomallei 9 \n(such as Rp1 and Rp2) may be considered as vaccine candidates, as proteins 10 \ncontaining tandem repeats (TR) are known targets of B-cell responses (15). Heat 11 \nshock proteins (HSPs) are also found to play a role in intracellular antigen processing 12 \nand presentation, and cross-presentation (36). Indeed a DNA vaccine encoding a BCG 13 \nheat-shock protein could enhance T-cell activation against mycobacterial infection 14 \n(19). The HSPs of B. pseudomallei have not been studied for vaccine development to 15 \ndate.  16 \nDCs are the control centre of the immune system and are specialized antigen-17 \npresenting cells that regulate the initiation of T-cell responses to eradicate invading 18 \npathogens (31). In mice, immunization with DCs pulsed with heat-killed B. 19 \npseudomallei in the presence of CpG adjuvant led to the induction of both cell-20 \nmediated and humoral responses to the organism (12). However, little is known about 21 \nthe biology of DCs in relation to B. pseudomallei antigens and the generation of 22 \neffective T-cell immunity in humans. In a previous study, we determined the ability of 23 \nABC transporter proteins LolC, OppA and PotF to restimulate T-cells in whole blood 24 \nor PBMC from seropositive healthy humans and recovered melioidosis patients living 25 \n 6 \nin areas where melioidosis is endemic (29). Here, we have extended these 1 \nobservations by examining the ability of B. pseudomallei and a panel of its antigens to 2 \npulse human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) to stimulate autologous T-3 \ncell populations in vitro.  4 \nOur data show that autologous human DCs efficiently processed and presented 5 \nheat-killed B. pseudomallei and its purified antigens to CD4 T-cells and to a lesser 6 \nextent CD8 T-cells in a contact-dependent manner. Using this approach, tandem 7 \nrepeat sequence proteins were found to be novel T-cell immunogens of B. 8 \npseudomallei. We provide novel data on the B. pseudomallei antigens presented by 9 \nhuman DC, some of which are candidates for inclusion into vaccines to elicit cell-10 \nmediated immunity against melioidosis. 11 \n 12 \n 13 \n 14 \n 15 \n 16 \n 17 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 \n 21 \n 22 \n 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n 7 \nMaterial and Methods 1 \nHuman subjects  2 \nThe consent form for the study was approved by the Khon Kaen University Ethics 3 \nCommittee for Human Research (project number HE470506). All subjects signed the 4 \nconsent form and the data collected was not disclosed. Leukocyte-rich samples from 5 \nhealthy blood donors were collected as leftover samples from the Blood Transfusion 6 \nCenter, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University. The healthy subjects were 7 \ndivided into either seronegative or seropositive groups based on titers of antibody to 8 \nB. pseudomallei quantified by IHA. Seronegative subjects were  selected on the basis 9 \nof IHA titers lower 1:40  whereas the seropositive subjects presumed to have been 10 \nexposed to B. pseudomallei were selected by titers of 1:40 or greater (8). Both the 11 \nseronegative and seropositive donors were age-matched and had no clinical history of 12 \nmelioidosis but live in an endemic area of melioidosis (predominantly the Northeast 13 \nof Thailand). 14 \n 15 \nMonocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) 16 \nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque 17 \ndensity gradient centrifugation of leukocyte-rich samples. Monocytes (CD14+), CD4+ 18 \nand CD8+ T-cells were then isolated by positive selection using immunomagnetic 19 \nbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) and their purity determined by flow cytometry as 20 \ndescribed below.  Immature DC were generated from monocytes by culture in 300 21 \nU\/ml of  granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Preprotech, 22 \nUSA) and 200 U\/ml of interleukin-4 (IL-4) (Preprotech, USA) for 6 days  in 1 ml of 23 \ncomplete RPMI 1640 (RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v\/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine 24 \nserum (FBS), 100U\/ml penicillin, 100\u00b5g\/ml streptomycin and 2mM L-glutamine; 25 \n 8 \nSigma-Aldrich, USA). Every two days, 500 \u00b5l of culture supernatant was removed 1 \nand 500 \u00b5l of fresh culture medium containing cytokines at the same final 2 \nconcentrations added.  3 \n 4 \nProteins and peptides   5 \nLolC, OppA and PotF polypeptides lacking predicted membrane-spanning 6 \ndomains were expressed in E. coli under kanamycin selection, and purified as 7 \npreviously described (18).  Expression and purification of BipD and BopE proteins in 8 \nE. coli has been described elsewhere (16). The full-length B. pseudomallei Hsp60 9 \n(BpHsp60), Hsp70 (BpHsp70), and flagellin (Flg) genes were cloned and expressed 10 \nE. coli M15 cells and purified as described (34). Rp proteins and peptides were 11 \nsynthesized by In Bios International, Inc. (Seattle, USA). Purity of affinity-tagged 12 \nrecombinant proteins was evaluated by sodium dodecyl-sulphate-polyacrylamide gel 13 \nelectrophoresis and their concentration determined using bicinchonic acid assays 14 \n(Pierce Biotechnology, USA). All recombinant B. pseudomallei proteins used in this 15 \nstudy were negative when assayed for the presence of contaminating LPS by the LAL 16 \nreagent (Pyrotell\u00ae, Associates of Cape Cod, USA) with limit of detection 0.03 EU\/ml. 17 \n 18 \nCo-culture of monocyte-derived dendritic cells with T-cells 19 \nB. pseudomallei strain K96243 was cultured in Luria Bertani medium and 20 \ninactivated by heating at 100\u00b0C for 20 minutes. The number of viable bacteria prior to 21 \nheat-inactivation was determined by plating of serial dilutions to permit estimation of 22 \nthe multiplicity of infection (MOI). MoDCs were pulsed with heat-killed B. 23 \npseudomallei (HkBp) (MOI of 10:1) or purified B. pseudomallei proteins (1\u00b5g\/ml) for 24 \n18 hours. The pulsed-moDCs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline 25 \n 9 \n(PBS) and plated at 4x104 cells\/well into 96-well plates and co-cultured with 1 \nautologous CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells at 4x105 cells\/well (ratio of moDCs:T-cells = 2 \n1:10). Culture supernatants were collected after 48 hours of co-culture and IFN-\u03b3 3 \nlevels measured by ELISA as below. The polyclonal activator phytohemagglutinin 4 \n(PHA; Biochrom AG, Germany) served as a positive control for T-cell activation. The 5 \nIFN-\u03b3-inducing cytokines IL-12 and IL-15 (BD Biosciences, USA) were used as a 6 \npositive control for cytokine activation of T-cell via the T-cell receptor (TCR) 7 \nindependent pathway (29) Cultures of moDCs or T-cells alone were used as negative 8 \ncontrols. 9 \n 10 \nTranswell assay to demonstrate T-cell activation by pulsed DCs via TCR 11 \ndependent pathway  12 \n The Transwell assay consists of an upper and a lower chamber separated by a 0.4-13 \n\u00b5m pore size, polycarbonate membrane (Corning, USA) that allows diffusion of 14 \ncytokines and chemokines through the membrane but avoids the contact interaction of 15 \nthe cells in both chambers. MoDCs were pulsed with HkBp (MOI of 10:1) or purified 16 \nB. pseudomallei proteins (LolC or Rp2) (1\u00b5g\/ml) for 18 hours as described above.  17 \nThe pulsed-moDCs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 18 \nplated onto the upper chamber and autologous purified CD4+ T cells were placed in 19 \nthe lower chamber (DC: CD4+ T cell ratio = 1:10). The cultures were incubated at 20 \n37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 48 h. The supernatant was collected and kept at \u201320\u00b0C for ELISA 21 \nanalysis of IFN-\u03b3. 22 \n 23 \nQuantification of IFN-\u03b3 in culture supernatants by ELISA 24 \n 10 \nThe supernatants of moDC-T-cell co-cultures were assayed for IFN-\u03b3 production 1 \nusing an ELISA kit (BD Biosciences, USA). Plastic 96-well microtitration plates were 2 \ncoated with a mAb to human IFN-\u03b3 in 0.1M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer overnight at 3 \n4oC. The excess reagent was removed by washing the plate three times with 0.005% 4 \n(v\/v) Tween20 in PBS, and the plate was then blocked with 10% (v\/v) FCS in PBS 5 \nand incubated for 1 hour. The plate was washed three times, and then test supernatants 6 \nor a recombinant human IFN-\u03b3 standard added and incubated for 2 hours at room 7 \ntemperature (RT). After washing, biotinylated anti-human IFN-\u03b3 and avidin-8 \nhorseradish peroxidase conjugate were added and incubated for 1 hour at RT. The 9 \nplate was then washed seven times, then substrate solution added and incubated for 30 10 \nminutes at RT in the dark. Reactions were stopped with 2N H2SO4 and absorbance 11 \nread at 450 nm with an ELISA plate reader (Tecan, Austria). 12 \n 13 \nQuantification of cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 and Granzyme B (GrB) 14 \nCD4+ and CD8+ T-cells producing IFN-\u03b3 or GrB were enumerated by ELISPOT. In 15 \nsummary, pre-coated 96-well PVDF-plates (MSIP, Millipore) were incubated 16 \novernight with 15 \u00b5g\/ml of IFN-\u03b3 or GrB-specific antibody and then 4x104 moDC 17 \npulsed with HkBp or purified B. pseudomallei proteins were added to the plate in 18 \nduplicates. Pulsed-moDCs were then co-cultured with autologous CD4+ or CD8+ T-19 \ncells for 48 hours and IFN-\u03b3 and GrB secretion were detected by addition of 1 \u00b5g\/ml 20 \nbiotinylated anti-human IFN-\u03b3 and GrB at room temperature for 3 hours. After 21 \nwashing, 1 \u00b5g\/ml streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase was added for 1 hour and spots 22 \nwere revealed with a Bio-Rad alkaline phosphatase kit and enumerated under a 23 \nstereomicroscope. 24 \n 25 \n 11 \nFlow cytometric analysis 1 \nPurities of CD14+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells after separation using immunomagnetic 2 \nbeads were determined by flow cytometry after surface marker staining with FITC-3 \nconjugated marker-specific antibodies (Becton Dickinson, USA) at a concentration of 4 \n0.06-1 \u00b5g\/1x106 cells. Monocytes differentiated into DCs were enumerated by 5 \nstaining of DC-associated surface markers (CD11c+ and HLA-DR) and decreased 6 \nexpression of CD14 using at 0.06-1 \u00b5g\/1x106 cells of FITC anti-CD14, FITC anti-7 \nCD11c and PE anti-HLA-DR. Flow cytometry was used for the characterization of 8 \nIFN-\u03b3 producing memory CD4+ T-cells using allophycocyanin (APC) anti-IFN-\u03b3, 9 \nFITC anti-CCR7, and PE anti-CD45RA. Isotype-matched controls were included in 10 \neach analysis. Staining of immune cell surface markers was performed for 30 minutes 11 \nat 4\u00ba C. Data acquisition was performed with a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur and 12 \nanalyzed by CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences, USA). Forward Scatter\/Side 13 \nScatter was used as the first gate, with selection of lymphocytes in the first gate, 14 \nfollowed by IFN-\u03b3 dotplot for analysis of IFN-\u03b3+ cell frequency, with fast acquisition 15 \nat  >1,500 total events\/second. Following flow cytometry analysis, the purity of each 16 \ncell type was over 96%. The memory T-cell subsets were identified by gating on IFN-17 \n\u03b3\n+\n cells and then CCR7 and CD45RA combined analysis were used to characterize 18 \ncentral memory T-cells (TCM: CCR7+CD45RA-), effector memory T-cells (TEM: 19 \nCCR7-CD45RA-), effector memory RA T-cells (TEMRA: CCR7-CD45RA+), and 20 \nresting T-cells (CCR7+CD45RA+). 21 \n 22 \nMHC class II epitope prediction   23 \nEpitope prediction programs including the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) 24 \n(http:\/\/tools.immuneepitope.org\/analyze\/html\/mhc_II_binding.html) and ProPred 25 \n 12 \n(http:\/\/www.imtech.res.in\/raghava\/propred\/) were used to predict dominant human 1 \nTh1-cell epitopes of the full length Rp amino acid sequences in relation to major 2 \nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) class II restriction (10-mers to 15-mers, 3 \ndepending on program used).  Predicted epitopes that ranked highly across both 4 \nprograms were selected for further evaluation.  Preference was given to epitopes that 5 \nshowed high hypothetical affinity for more than one HLA type. 6 \n 7 \nIn vitro stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with 8 \nB. pseudomallei Rp peptides 9 \nPBMCs from healthy donors living in the endemic area were isolated from buffy 10 \ncoat samples by density centrifugation on HISTOPAQUE\u00ae 1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 11 \nthe number of cells adjusted as required prior to stimulation. The isolated PBMCs 12 \nwere stimulated with PHA as a mitogen, 1 \u00b5g\/ml LolC as positive  antigen control, 3 13 \n\u00b5g\/ml Rp proteins, or 3 \u00b5g\/ml each peptide, with medium alone as a negative control. 14 \nPeptide numbers 1-7 are test peptides derived from B. pseudomallei Rp proteins. The 15 \nnumber of cells stimulated to secrete IFN-\u03b3 was evaluated by ELISPOT as above. 16 \n 17 \nHLA-typing  18 \nHLA-DRB1 alleles in the samples used above were determined by PCR-SSP using 19 \ntwenty pairs of primers (22, 23). The primer mixtures contained a pair of allele-20 \nspecific primers and a pair of 256-bp internal control primers. 21 \n 22 \nStatistical analysis 23 \n 13 \n Statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney test) was performed using Graphpad Prism 1 \nversion 5 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). A P-value < 0.05 was 2 \nconsidered statistically significant. 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n 10 \n 11 \n 12 \n 13 \n 14 \n 15 \n 16 \n 17 \n 18 \n 14 \nRESULTS 1 \nT-cell responses of seropositive versus seronegative healthy donors to moDCs 2 \npulsed with heat-killed B. pseudomallei  3 \nWe demonstrated previously using a whole blood assay that T-cells from 4 \nseropositive and recovered melioidosis subjects respond to heat-killed B. 5 \npseudomallei (HkBp) by producing IFN-\u03b3 (29). Here, we first defined the contribution 6 \nof IFN-\u03b3 production from CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells co-cultured with antigen-pulsed 7 \nautologous moDCs. T-cell subsets were purified from 9 healthy donors that were 8 \nseropositive to B. pseudomallei and 8 seronegative donors. These were co-cultured 9 \nwith HkBp-pulsed moDCs for 48 hours then IFN-\u03b3 levels in cultured supernatants 10 \nassayed by ELISA. The ratio of moDC:T-cell was optimized by comparing responses 11 \nto HkBp at 1:5, 1:10, 1:50 and 1:100, with the highest IFN-\u03b3 level being observed at a 12 \nmoDC:T-cell ratio of 1:10. Moreover the incubation period and the concentration of 13 \neach protein were also optimized (data not shown). Cells were separately stimulated 14 \nwith PHA or medium alone as positive and negative controls, respectively.  15 \n CD4+ T-cells of 6\/8 seronegative donors showed statistically significant IFN-\u03b3 16 \nresponses to HkBp, compared with medium control but the magnitude of IFN-\u03b3 17 \nsecretion was low (Figure 1). In contrast, 8 out of 9 seropositive donors showed 18 \nextensive IFN-\u03b3 production with mean values of 10.52 ng\/ml as compared to 0.81 19 \nng\/ml in the seronegative group (P<0.001). A response by  CD8+ T-cells from 7\/9 20 \nseropositive donors was also observed but was 13 fold lower than the CD4+ T-cell 21 \nresponse  showing that the latter were the dominant IFN-\u03b3 producing T-cells under 22 \nthese restimulation conditions.(P<0.001, Mann-Whitney test). These results are 23 \nconsistent with previous data in whole blood assays (29).  24 \n 25 \n 15 \nPurified B. pseudomallei proteins are recognized by CD4+T-cells of seropositive 1 \nhealthy donors  2 \nIn an effort to identify the proteins of B. pseudomallei recognized by cell-mediated 3 \nimmunity in humans, the IFN-\u03b3 response of CD4+ T-cells to ten different purified Bps 4 \nproteins presented by moDCs was evaluated. The proteins; LolC, OppA, PotF (ABC 5 \ntransporter proteins), BipD, BopE (Bsa T3SS proteins), Hsp60, Hsp70 (heat shock 6 \nproteins), Rp1 and Rp2 (tandem repeated proteins), and flagellin were expressed in E. 7 \ncoli and affinity purified as described in the Materials and Methods. MoDCs from 9 8 \nseropositive and 8 seronegative healthy donors were separately pulsed with each 9 \npurified protein for 48 hours. PHA and HkBp served as a positive controls owing to 10 \ntheir ability to evoke strong responses of CD4+ T-cells from seropositive donors 11 \n(Figure 1) while negative controls comprised of medium, moDCs alone and un-12 \nstimulated CD4+ T-cells (Figure 2A). The results from B. pseudomallei protein, LolC 13 \nshowed that 4 out of 7 seropositive individuals had a modest response to LolC, 3 had 14 \na response higher than the average and one of the 7 had a high response; similar 15 \nresponse was observed from Rp2 protein. The mean quantities of IFN-\u03b3 produced by 16 \nCD4+ T-cells from seropositive donors in response to LolC and Rp2 were higher than 17 \nin the seronegative group (Figure 2B; P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). The other 18 \nproteins also elicited elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3, from some but not all individuals in the 19 \nseropositive group (3\/9 of seropositive donors) but this heterogeneity resulted in no 20 \nstatistically significant differences when the mean between seropositive and 21 \nseronegative donors was compared. Of note, CD4+ T-cells from these 3 seropositive 22 \ndonors responded strongly to all 10 B. pseudomallei proteins while the other 6 23 \nindividuals were low responders. 24 \n 25 \n 16 \nHeat-killed B. pseudomallei and its proteins were recognized by effector memory 1 \nCD4+ T-cells through a contact-dependent pathway  2 \nThe previous result indicated the dominant response of CD4+ T-cells of 3 \nseropositive healthy donors to HkBp and the B. pseudomallei proteins LolC and Rp2. 4 \nWe have previously demonstrated that production of IFN-\u03b3 by T-cells in response to 5 \nB. pseudomallei occurs predominately via T-cell receptors  but can also occur via a 6 \ncytokine-dependent,  cyclosporine A insensitive pathway (20) (29). To investigate 7 \nwhether the stimulation of CD4+ T-cells by pulsed moDC observed here occurred via 8 \nthe T-cell receptor pathway, a Transwell culture method was used to prevent cell-to-9 \ncell contact but permit diffusion of soluble factors during co-culture. MoDCs from 10 \nseropositive healthy donors were separately pulsed with HkBp or recombinant LolC 11 \nor Rp2 and plated into 24-well culture plates for 18 hours. Autologous purified CD4+ 12 \nT-cells were then plated on a polycarbonate insert well at a moDC:CD4+ T-cell ratio 13 \nof 1:10 and co-cultured for 48 hours and the IFN-\u03b3 concentration in culture 14 \nsupernatants was measured by ELISA. The amount of IFN-\u03b3 produced by CD4+ T-15 \ncells co-cultured with, but separated from moDCs pulsed with HkBp, LolC or Rp2 16 \nwas reduced to baseline levels compared to co-cultures in direct contact (Figure 3A; 17 \nP<0.05 ). This indicates that antigen-pulsed moDCs predominantly stimulate CD4+ T-18 \ncells to produce IFN-\u03b3 through a contact-dependent pathway rather than as a 19 \nconsequence of bystander cytokine-mediated effects.  20 \nTo identify IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4+ T-cell subsets, memory phenotypes of T-cells 21 \nwere characterized. Our previous study classified T-cell phenotypes based on 22 \nexpression of CD45RA and CCR7, whereby CD45RA+\/CCR7+ denote naive or 23 \nresting T-cells, CD45RA-\/CCR7+ denote TCM (central memory) cells, CD45RA-24 \n\/CCR7- denote TEM (effector memory) cells, and CD45RA+\/CCR7- denote TEMRA 25 \n 17 \n(terminally differentiated effector memory RA) cells (2). Here, purified CD4+ T-cells 1 \nfrom seropositive donors were co-cultured with moDC primed separately with HkBp 2 \nor LolC for 24 hours and IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ T-cells were analyzed by flow 3 \ncytometry. The result showed that the majority of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ T-cells co-4 \ncultured with moDC-pulsed HkBp or LolC were TEM (76% and 73% of IFN-\u03b3-5 \nproducing CD4+ T-cells, respectively). The other CD4+ T-cell phenotypes detected in 6 \nresponse to moDC pulsed with HkBp or LolC were 9% and 4 % of TCM, 11% and 7 \n16% of TEMRA, and 4% and 7% of resting T-cells, respectively (Figure 3B). Thus in 8 \nhealthy seropositive donors, effector memory CD4+ T-cells are the major contributors 9 \nto the IFN-\u03b3 response under these culture conditions.  10 \n 11 \nHeat-killed B. pseudomallei and its purified proteins activate cytotoxic CD8+ T-12 \ncells to produce Granzyme B 13 \nGranzyme B (GrB) is a serine protease that is an important mediator of target-cell 14 \napoptosis by cells such as natural killer cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells (25). To 15 \nevaluate whether moDC pulsed with HkBp or purified proteins can stimulate B. 16 \npseudomallei-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), we measured the expression of 17 \nGrB in CD8+ T-cells from seropositive subjects in response to moDC separately 18 \npulsed with HkBp or the ten B. pseudomallei proteins described above. The number of 19 \ncells producing GrB was evaluated by ELISPOT. The results revealed that moDCs 20 \npulsed with HkBp, LolC and Hsp60 could activate CD8+ T-cells to produce GrB 21 \n(Figure 4). The other B. pseudomallei proteins tended to stimulate CD8+ T-cells of 22 \ncertain seropositive subjects; even though, GrB secretion was not significantly 23 \ndifferent when compared with medium negative control. Thus, of the ten antigens 24 \ntested, only LolC was recognized by both reactive CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells.  25 \n 18 \n 1 \nPrediction of T-cell epitopes of B. pseudomallei tandem repeated sequence 2 \nproteins (Rp)  3 \nOur data indicate that B. pseudomallei Rp2 significantly stimulates T-cell 4 \nresponses when presented by moDCs (Figure 2). It is therefore of interest to identify 5 \nthe immunodominant epitopes of Rp proteins. Seven peptides were analyzed upon 6 \nhypothetical strength of binding and range of affinity (Table 1). It was predicted that 7 \npeptides 1, 2, 5, and 6 would be recognized by HLA-DR04 most efficiently. Peptide 5 8 \nwas predicted to be recognized by HLA-DR03, DR04, DR11 and DR15. Peptide 7 9 \nwould be recognized by HLA-DR13 as predicted by ProPred but it would not be 10 \nrecognized by any HLA-DR as predicted by IEDB. Peptides 3 and 4 were predicted 11 \nnot to be bound by any types of HLA-DR; however, they may be recognized by other 12 \nMHC class II molecules. 13 \n 14 \nRp peptides elicit a response from PBMCs of healthy donors from an area 15 \nendemic for melioidosis  16 \nTo investigate the immune response to Rp proteins and its peptides in healthy 17 \nindividuals in an area endemic for melioidosis, PBMCs from 6 volunteers were 18 \nseparately stimulated with LolC, Rp proteins, and the 7 Rp peptides predicted above 19 \n(numbers 1-7). IFN-\u03b3 production was then measured by ELISPOT.  The IFN-\u03b3 20 \nresponses to both Rp1 and Rp2 were statically significant; moreover, a significantly 21 \ngreater number of cells responded to the peptide numbers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 compared 22 \nwith medium control (Figure 5).  To map the T-cell epitopes recognized by healthy 23 \nsubjects, typing of HLA-DRB1 was performed for all donors. HLA-DR typing of the 24 \ndonors responding to the peptides demonstrated that they represented a heterogeneous 25 \n 19 \ngroup with respect to HLA, expressing DR15,12, DR13,07, DR15,14, DR15,04, 1 \nDR03,04 and DR04,10 (Table 2). The ability of donor PMBCs in response to Rp 2 \npeptides is largely consistent with the computational prediction of HLA-restricted 3 \nepitopes, whereby peptides 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 where predicted to bind HLA-DR types 4 \n(Table 1).  5 \n 20 \nDiscussion 1 \nB. pseudomallei causes severe invasive infections with a high mortality rate in 2 \nendemic areas. Recent studies have begun to unravel the bacterial constituents and 3 \nhost responses required for control of melioidosis. For example, we identified protein 4 \ntargets of human antibody responses using protein microarrays (13). However, the 5 \ndevelopment of effective vaccines for B. pseudomallei likely requires cell-mediated 6 \nimmunity owing to the ability of the pathogen to persist for protracted periods in an 7 \nintracellular niche. In a previous study, we applied a whole blood assay (WBA) to 8 \nexplore human cellular responses to the pathogen, demonstrating the priming of B. 9 \npseudomallei reactive T-cells in healthy individuals living in the endemic region of 10 \nNE Thailand. However, such assays  do not  examine the APC-T-cell interactions 11 \nrequired for successful immune responses and give high background levels of IFN-\u03b3 12 \ndue to the presence of NK cells  (29). In an effort to circumvent these issues, heat-13 \nkilled bacteria and ten purified proteins of the pathogen were evaluated for their 14 \nability to stimulate T-cell responses when presented by autologous moDCs.  15 \nDCs are professional antigen-presenting cells and play a central role in initiating 16 \nT-cell responses. Evidence exists that B. pseudomallei infected-human moDCs are 17 \nable to induces T-cell differentiation toward a Th1 population in a manner dependent 18 \nupon cytokine production (3). Our study revealed that moDCs pulsed with heat-killed 19 \nB. pseudomallei or recombinant protein antigens predominantly stimulated IFN-\u03b3 20 \nproduction by CD4+ rather than CD8+ T-cells ex vivo. After HkBp stimulation, IFN-\u03b3 21 \nproducing cells from seropositive subjects responded to a much greater extent when 22 \ncompared with seronegative subjects from the endemic area. In seropositive donors, 23 \nIFN-\u03b3 production from CD4+ T-cells was considerably higher than that from CD8+ T-24 \n 21 \ncells. This result is consistent with previous data that  induction of IFN-\u03b3 in response 1 \nto the organism is elevated in seropositive donors (1, 29).  2 \nThe important role of CD4+ T-cells has been demonstrated in a mouse model of 3 \nmelioidosis, where antigen-specific CD4+ T-cells were  induced by infection with a 4 \nlive-attenuated B. pseudomallei mutant and correlated with protection against 5 \nsecondary infection (16, 17). The role of CD4+ T-cells in human melioidosis is less 6 \nclear, since HIV\/AIDS is apparently not a risk factor for melioidosis (10). 7 \nNevertheless, our findings confirm that exposure to B. pseudomallei clearly results in 8 \npriming of a robust T-cell response as CD4+ T-cells from seropositive individuals 9 \nrespond to moDC pulsed with HkBp by producing high levels of IFN-\u03b3. This was 10 \nconsistent with our previous study in whole blood cultures that revealed an 11 \nassociation between the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 from antigen-specific T-cells in response 12 \nto the pathogen or its ABC transporter proteins (LolC, OppA and PotF) and increasing 13 \nantibody titers (29). To further identify antigens that may be involved in this process, 14 \nwe confirmed the immunogenicity of ABC transporter proteins and screened new 15 \npurified proteins, some of which are associated with B. pseudomallei virulence, for 16 \ntheir ability to stimulate human T-cells when presented by moDC. This revealed that 17 \nthe newly defined Rp2 protein elicited significantly higher IFN-\u03b3 responses in primed 18 \nCD4+ T-cells, compared to controls. 19 \nIn addition,  CD4+ T-cells of some responders from the seropositive group could 20 \nproduce IFN-\u03b3 at levels above the mean in response to the other proteins tested 21 \nincluding ABC transporter proteins (OppA and PotF), T3SS proteins (BipD and 22 \nBopE), heat shock proteins (Hsp60, and Hsp70), tandem repeated protein Rp1, and 23 \nflagellin. These results suggested that there were 2 groups of seropositive individuals 24 \nwho were relatively high and low responders to B. pseudomallei. Meanwhile, CD4+ 25 \n 22 \nT-cells reactive to purified BipD and BopE have been detected following 1 \nimmunization of mice, however in murine models immunization with BipD or other 2 \npredicted components of the Bsa type III secretion apparatus has not elicited 3 \nsignificant protection against acute melioidosis (11, 27). Conversely, recombinant 4 \nflagellin could provide limited protection in mice albeit not as great as when used 5 \ngiven as a plasmid DNA vaccine or with specific adjuvants such as CpG  (5, 6, 30). 6 \nRecombinant Hsp, especially Hsp70, can induce T-cell responses due to the flagellin 7 \ncontamination (34). It remains possible that other T3SS, flagella or Hsp-related 8 \nproteins may induce protective human cell-mediated immunity or that responses to 9 \nexisting antigens characterized to date may be rationally improved using novel 10 \ndelivery or adjuvant strategies.  11 \nIn a whole blood assay, NK cells, CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells from subjects 12 \nexposed to B. pseudomallei respond to HkBp by rapidly producing IFN-\u03b3 (29). In 13 \nsuch assays, it is possible that the response could be cytokine-dependent and 14 \nindependent of the TCR pathway. By using a Transwell system to prevent cell contact 15 \nbut permit diffusion of soluble mediators, we observed that the dominant response of 16 \nthe CD4+ T-cell subset from exposed subjects to moDC pulsed with HkBp, LolC or 17 \nRp2 relies on a cell-to-cell contact-dependent pathway.  18 \nSelected components of ABC transport systems, especially LolC, have been 19 \ndemonstrated to induce partial protection when mixed with adjuvant and used to 20 \nimmunize mice (18), as well as to induce human antigen-specific T-cell responses 21 \n(29). Proteins of the tandem repeat family, of which Rp2 is a member, have been 22 \nexamined as a target for B-cells to produce antibody in certain parasitic infections 23 \n(15). We show here for the first time that Rp2 elicits human antigen-specific CD4+ T-24 \n 23 \ncell responses at least as effectively as LolC and it will be of interest to determine if it 1 \nis similarly effective in inducing partial protection against melioidosis in mice. 2 \nWe used differential expression of CD45RA and CCR7 to characterize the IFN-\u03b3 3 \nproducing CD4+ T-cells as either central memory (CM), effector memory (EM) or the 4 \nmore recently described effector memory RA (EMRA) populations (2). By these 5 \ncriteria, the majority of IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ T-cells reacting to HkBp and LolC were found to 6 \nbe TEM cells (76% and 73%, respectively), with the remaining minority being TEMRA 7 \nand TCM cells. While TCM could provide potentially a rapid function by producing 8 \ncytokines that aid generation of TEMRA (14, 33). It is likely that the whole blood assay 9 \nmay involve distinct T-cell interactions to those detected with antigen-pulsed moDCs.   10 \nAlthough CD4+ T-cells were the dominant producers of IFN-\u03b3 in these assays, 11 \nheat-killed bacteria and B. pseudomallei Hsp60 were also able to stimulate CD8 T-12 \ncells to secrete Granzyme B, an indicator of potential cytotoxic activity.  In 13 \nmycobacterial infection, the immunization of mycobacterial Hsp60 induced the 14 \ncytotoxic function of CD8+ T-cells specific for mycobacterial Hsp60 (35).  15 \nHaving provided the first evidence that the B. pseudomallei Rp2 protein is a target 16 \nof human cell-mediated responses, we sought to identify Rp peptide epitopes and 17 \ndetermine if they are recognized by co-culture with PBMCs of healthy donors of 18 \nvarying HLA types living in Northeast Thailand. Five of seven predicted MHC class 19 \nII epitopes of Rp stimulated a significant number of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells. HLA 20 \ntyping of individuals revealed that 50% of subjects presented heterozygous alleles of 21 \nHLA-DR04 and 50% of subjects presented heterozygous alleles of HLA-DR15. The 22 \nmost common alleles in the NE Thai population include DRB1*1202 and 23 \nDRB1*1502 (23). Our results indicate that several Rp epitopes elicit strong IFN-\u03b3 24 \nresponses from human cellular immunity, across individuals with HLA DR-restricted 25 \n 24 \nalleles in this small sample size of the Thai population in a Burkholderia endemic 1 \narea. 2 \nIn conclusion, we evaluated the ability of moDC separately pulsed with ten 3 \nvirulence-associated recombinant proteins of B. pseudomallei to stimulate autologous 4 \nhuman CD4+ T-cell and CD8+ T-cell responses. Our results demonstrate that antigen-5 \nspecific CD4+ T-cells are generated following exposure of humans to B. pseudomallei 6 \nin the environment as they can be stimulated to produce IFN-\u03b3 after encountering 7 \nmoDC pulsed with heat-killed B. pseudomallei or purified proteins, particularly LolC 8 \nand Rp2. Antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells are also produced that are a potential source 9 \nof IFN-\u03b3 and GrB, especially in response to LolC. Our ability to detect human 10 \nantigen-specific T-cell responses to defined B. pseudomallei proteins informs the 11 \nselection of candidates for inclusion into protein or protein-polysaccharide conjugate 12 \nsubunit vaccines against this important and emerging infection. Moreover, Rp epitope 13 \nsequences analyzed here are conserved across B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis and 14 \nthe causative agent of equine glanders B. mallei, suggesting they would have broad 15 \nvaccine potential across human and veterinary use for melioidosis and glanders.  16 \n 25 \nAcknowledgements 1 \nPT and DoR are supported by the Commission on Higher Education, Ministry of 2 \nEducation, Thailand.
