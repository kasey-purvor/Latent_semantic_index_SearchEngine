In recent years, quartz tuning forks have been widely used for\nthis purpose. Although, used primarily as frequency standards (32,768Hz) in watches,\nthese inexpensive, robust and magnetically insensitive forks have shown [1] a promising\nresponse as probes to study the properties of low viscosity liquids. They have been\nexploited for studies of laminar, potential and turbulent flows in normal and superfluid\nhelium-4 [2\u20134], where the onset of turbulence is defined by a threshold (critical) velocity\nof the flow. The measurement methods in previous studies include a bridge scheme [1]\nand a current measurement scheme [2], where the current is measured across a resistor\nV. B.

After that the optical interferometry measurement technique\nwill be described in detail for the second fork and a comparison will be made between\nthe fork velocities measured electrically and optically. Finally, the force-velocity rela-\ntion will be obtained for the first fork in He-II at different temperatures and the critical\nvelocities for turbulence generation at these temperatures will be described.\n2 Experiments and results\nThe size parameters of one of the prongs of the first 8 kHz fork are L=9.235 mm,\nW=0.399 mm, T=0.909 mm, where L,W, T represent the length, width and the thick-\nness of each prong. The separation between the inward-facing ends of the prongs was\nD=0.49 mm. The measured resonant frequency at room temperature in vacuo (pressure\nbelow 1 mbar) was fR=8458.73 Hz with a Q-factor \u2248 105 (the width of the resonance\ncurve being \u2206f = 0.072 Hz). The vacuum measurement was repeated at low tempera-\ntures under continuous pumping (P < 2mbar) of superfluid helium with the fork just\nabove the liquid level, yielding fR=8443.9 Hz, while the quality of the fork increased\nthree-fold (the vacuum-helium measurement).\n2.1 Calibration of fork velocity\nThe velocity calibration of the fork is done electrically by finding its electromechanical\nconstant [2] a (also called the fork constant). The theoretical value of a is given by [8]\naT = 3d11E\nTW\nL\n, (1)\nwhere d11= 2.31\u00d710\u221212 m\/V is the longitudinal piezoelectric modulus of quartz and\nE=7.87\u00d71010 N\/m2 is the elasticity modulus of quartz. In our case aT=2.142\u00d710\u22125 C\/m.\nExperimentally, the fork constant a is measured by considering the fork oscillator as\na series L\u2212C\u2212R resonator. The fork is excited with an ac voltage U = U0 cos(\u03c9t) while\nthe frequency is slowly swept through resonance. The stress due to the fork deflection\ninduces charge proportionately, and thus the induced current I(t) is proportional to\nthe derivative of the fork deflection i.e. to the velocity.\nI(t) = a\ndx\ndt\n(2)\nHere the fork constant a connects the mechanical properties of the tuning fork to\nits electrical equivalent properties. This current I(t) is measured across a resistor (\u223c\n995\u2126) and the corresponding voltage response is measured on a Stanford Research\nSR-830 low-noise lock-in amplifier. In this case, the electro-mechanical coefficient of\nthe fork response may be found [9] from the equation\naEM =\n\u221a\n2m\u2217\u2206\u03c9\nR\n, (3)\n3where m\u2217 = 0.2426\u03c1LWT is the effective mass of one prong in vacuum [8] and is\n2.161\u00d710\u22126 kg for our fork. \u2206\u03c9 is 2pi times the width of the resonance curve I(f) and\nR is the electrical resistance of the fork and is determined by the current amplitude\nat resonance for a given drive for which the response is linear. The 8 kHz fork at room\ntemperature in vacuo gives R = 19.902 k\u2126 with a corresponding width \u2206f= 0.072Hz.\nThe calculated value of the fork constant aEM was 0.97\u00d710\u22125 C\/m which amounts\nto 45% of the theoretical value given by equation (1). The experimental value of a\nmeasured in air is within 2% of the value measured in vacuum. This is because of the\nlow density of the air, the prong mass in air mair\n\u2217 being very close to the vacuum\nmass in equation 3. The second reason is due to the experimental fact that the value\nof \u2206f\/R is constant for a given drive irrespective of the medium.\nFig. 1 (color online) Left: schematic diagram of the Michelson interferometer arrange-\nment. Right: oscilloscope traces of interferometric signals (upper\/green curves) for excitations\n(lower\/red curves) of UG = 6.5 mVRMS (top) and UG = 28 mVRMS (bottom) at room tem-\nperature.\n2.2 Michelson interferometry\nThe second 8 kHz fork used for optical measurements has fork constant aEM within\n2-3% of the first fork from the same batch. The direct measurement of the fork ve-\nlocity driven at resonance (8.45 kHz in air) was determined by use of a conventional\nMichelson interferometry scheme at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, as\nillustrated schematically in Fig.1. The visible light beam from a semiconductor laser\n(\u03bbL = 670 nm) was split into two beams by a non-polarising beam splitter. A beam\nreflected from the end of the leg of the tuning fork, vibrating at the resonant frequency\nat a position A(t) = A0 sin(\u03c9Rt) interferes with another beam, reflected from the fixed\nmirror. The spot size of the beam on the fork leg was \u223c 0.2mm and it was at a distance\n4\u223c 0.9mm from the tip of the leg. The amplitude of the interfering waves is proportional\nto sum of both waves\nS = B1e\ni\u03c9t +B2e\ni(\u03c9t+\u03d50+A(t)) = B1e\ni\u03c9t \u00d7 (1 +B2\/B1 \u00d7 ei(\u03d50+A(t))) (4)\nThe interference intensity is recorded by a photodiode. Mathematically this signal is\nproportional to U \u223c S \u00d7 S\u2217 and is given by\nU \u223c 1+B2+B\u00d7ei(\u03d50+A(t))+B\u00d7e\u2212i(\u03d50+A(t)) = 1+B2+2\u00d7B\u00d7cos(\u03d50+A(t)) (5)\nThe alternating traces of this recorded signal Uac \u223c 2 \u00d7 B \u00d7 cos(\u03d50 + A(t)) are syn-\nchronized with the fork excitation signal shown on the right side of the Fig. 1. The\nmaximum recording AC signal corresponds to the phase of \u03d50 = pi\/2 (or = (n+1\/2)pi),\nwhich was adjusted by change of the distance to the mirror, and the amplitude of the\ntuning fork oscillation equal to\n2\u00d7 2\u00d7A0 = \u03bbL\/2 (6)\nas shown in the upper-right part of the figure. As the drive amplitude to the fork is\nincreased, the optical signal at first increases too, until it attains a maximum value at\na drive corresponding to A0 = \u03bbL\/8 condition. In the present case, this condition was\nreached when the drive to the fork was 6.5mVRMS. At higher drives the fraction of\nhigher harmonics increases in the optical signal, meaning multiple interference maxima\nand minima within a single period of fork motion. For example, the lower picture\nshows the optical signal obtained for 28mVRMS drive to the fork and 4 peaks can\nbe seen clearly. The 4th peak started to appear when the fork drive was 26mVRMS\nwhich further validates 6.5mVRMS drive for the maximum optical signal. The fork\namplitude at this drive would have been A0 = \u03bbL\/8 = 670\/8\u224884 nm. So the optical\nvelocity Vo of the fork at resonance for UG = 6.5 mVRMS drive can be estimated as\nv = A0 \u00d7 \u03c9R = 8.4\u00d7 10\u22128 \u00d7 8.45\u00d7 103 \u00d7 6.28 \u2248 4.5\u00d7 10\u22123 m\/s or 4.5 mm\/s within\n20% experimental error. The maximum velocity of the tip of the fork prong is \u223c 10%\nhigher, vmax =4.9 mm\/s.\nFor UG = 6.5 mVRMS fork gives a current response of j = 32nARMS at resonance\nunder similar conditions (at room temperature and air pressure). This current response\ncorresponds to an electrical velocity (from equation 2) of the fork vEM=4.7mm\/s.\nThis suggests that the electrical velocity is within 5-10% of the optical velocity\nand hence both are equal within the experimental error. We used the fork constant\na = 0.92\u00d7 10\u22125 C\/m obtained from optical measurements.\n2.3 Fork oscillation in liquid helium\nThe first fork was used for measurements in liquid helium. The force equivalent to the\ndrive applied to the fork is driven is [2]\nF0 = (a\/2)U0 (7)\nSome results are shown in Fig. 2. The right scale corresponds to the real (optical)\nmaximum velocities (at the end of a prong).\nAt low excitation the fork response and corresponding velocity are proportional to\nthe driving force. Higher excitation leads to the appearance of some additional mech-\nanism of energy dissipation and to a deviation of the fork response (and its velocity)\n51 10 100 1000 10000\n1E-3\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n          8 kHz\n Vacuum Room\n Vacuum He\n NHe T=4.2 K\n in air, optical measurement\n SF T=2.093 K\n SF T=1.95 K\n SF T=1.402 K\n SF T=1.4 K\nI, \nA\nR\nM\nS\nUex, mVRMS\nv~F 1\/2\nv~F\n v\nM\nA\nX,\n c\nm\n\/s\nv~F\nFig. 2 (color online) The electrical response of the fork in air, in vacuum at room tempera-\nture, and in liquid helium at different temperatures.

The left ordinate axis shows the fork\nresponse and the right one shows the optical prong velocity.\nfrom linear dependence. Note that such deviations were not seen in vacuum (Fig. 2);\nthey are usually attributed to the transition to turbulence above a critical velocity\n[10]. We estimated the deviation of the applied force (and counteracting fluid forces)\nby subtracting the linear dependence at low excitation.\nFadd = F (v)\u2212 C \u00d7 v (8)\nThe results are shown in Fig. 3. The fluid friction force increases very rapidly after the\ncritical velocity vc is attained. We fitted the deviation by power law Fadd = C2 \u00d7 (v\u2212\nvc)\nN at different temperatures, leading to the results presented in table 1.\nIn conclusion, it appears that the onset of turbulence in He II results in an additional\nforce that rises faster than F \u221d v2. The critical velocity of vc \u2248 10 cm\/s is similar to the\nvalues found in previous work. The absolute maximum velocity of the prong vibration\nis adequately estimated from the electro-mechanical model based on the actual lengths\nof the fork legs and electrical contacts.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Ian Bradley, Rich Haley, George Pickett and Viktor\nTsepelin for helpful discussions, and to Bruno Studer for providing samples of tuning forks.\nSpecial thanks are due to W.
