Introduction \nThe term `crystallinity` is used extensively throughout a number of disciplines to characterise a wide \nrange of materials.   It is an attribute that is related to the amount of long range structural order within a \nmaterial that can be moderated by features such as grain boundaries and point\/linear\/planar defects. These \nare of interest as they can significantly modify a materials` physical and chemical properties.  For \narchaeologists crystallinity measurement is regularly employed as an indicator of the degree of diagenetic \nchange or thermal modification of bone mineral.   These two processes have implications for assessing \npreservation state and determining the isotopic composition of bone but a technique that reliably \ndistinguishes them remains elusive (Pijoan et al. 2007).  \nCrystallinity is frequently quantified by X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy as these methods \nare sensitive to structural order.   However, due to the complex physio-chemical nature of bioapatites a \npragmatic approach is often adopted for crystallinity quantification and thus a number of indices that \nprovide some relative measure of average crystallinity have been adopted.    Within archaeological science, \nthese indices derive from a number of practices including an infrared splitting factor (IRSF) which is based \nupon the degenerative splitting of a phosphate band (Surovell and Stiner, 2001;  Weiner et al. 1993),  a \nmultiple peak IR summing method (Lebon et al. 2008), a simple measure of a single diffraction peak width \n(Hedges et al. 1995), or multiple diffraction peak widths (Person et al. 1995;  Quattropani et al. 1999).  The \npotential advantages of more sophisticated X-ray diffraction whole pattern fitting methods, although \ncapable of providing direction dependent data (Stathopoulou et al. 2008;  Piga et al. 2008 ), have not yet \nbeen fully realised in this context.    Small angle X-ray scattering to characterise crystallite particle size has \nalso been successfully applied to heated bone (Hiller et al. 2003). However the resultant values are difficult \nto compare directly to the more commonly used wide angle approach due to the confounding effect of \nmicrostrain.    \nThe use of crystallinity indicators as reliable proxies for mineral alteration and bone integrity remains \nsomewhat controversial with several studies questioning its reliability (Puceat et al. 2004; Trueman et al. \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n2008). Regardless of these issues, it is important to appreciate the limitations of material crystallinity \ndetermination and ensure that, when used, methods are appropriate for the materials being examined.  For \nexample, indices providing crystallinity indicator values averaged through a number of crystallographic \ndirections (e.g. spectroscopy) may not provide an accurate indication of crystallinity changes in materials \ncontaining crystallites with a high morphological aspect ratio when this ratio becomes modified.   Further, \nand particularly for diffraction methods, calculation of crystallinity indicators are confounded by crystallite \npreferred orientation, stoichiometry and inherent differences in instrument dispersion.  These factors reflect \nthe inherent anisotropic nature of bone minerals' mechanical properties that is essential for providing \noptimal weight bearing, e.g. bone mineral is formed in accordance with the principles of maximising \nresistance to stress.  \nStudying the problem of reliable crystallinity measurement to map microstructure in the context of \ndiagenetically altered and heated bone which have previously been described as possessing similar \ncrystallinity indicator values is of some value.  Indeed both modification mechanisms have been \nextensively studied and are known to involve mineral recrystallisation.   It has also been reported (Stiner et \nal. 1995) that weathering produces crystallinity changes similar to those associated with heat treatment \nwhen characterised by infrared spectroscopy and that boiling can mirror diagenetic effects (Roberts et al. \n2002).  Crystallite dimensions within diagenetically modified mineral (Bartsiokas and Middleton, 1992;  \nHiller et al. 2003) have been determined to be of similar value to those of contemporary bone heated to \n~600 oC (Rogers and Daniels, 2002; Holden et al. 1995).  Distinguishing between the processes of \ndiagenesis and burning would therefore be valuable in studies of archaeological bone when both processes \ncontribute to the recrystallisation state of the mineral.  Thus when examining cremated bone, details of \nfunerary practices may be inferred with more confidence. \n This work focuses upon X-ray diffraction characterisation and extends the crystallinity indicator \nconcept to identify separate crystallite size and microstrain contributions to structural disorder.  The \ndirection dependence of these features has also been examined.    For archaeology, there is a desire to \nprovide a more complete description of the diagenetic and thermal processes affecting bone mineral. Native \nbone mineral crystallites display significant anisotropy in many of their physical characteristics e.g. \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \nmorphology and lattice strain.  It is therefore reasonable to suggest that any modifications to the mineral as \na result of external factors should also display an anisotropic character which may be obscured using \ncurrent crystallinity determinations. \n \n2. Source of bone \nThe study compared bone mineral features from two principal groups, i.e. diagenetically altered and heat \nmodified bone.   For each group five species were considered and for each species three individuals were \nexamined.   For each principal group, the mineral was analysed in its native state and also following heat \ntreatment. \nArchaeological (diagenetically altered) bone samples were obtained from the excavation of an Anglo-\nSaxon settlement site at Fillingham, Lincolnshire (Chamberlain et al. 2000). The approximate stratigraphic \nperiod from which the bones were retrieved ranged from Anglo Saxon to the late 1700's A.D. and all were \nhumeri except for three radii.  Contemporary tissues were sourced from the Veterinary Laboratories \nAgency of DEFRA, local abattoirs and the North London Tissue Bank (human samples) and were all \nfemurs.  The archaeological material was identified anthropologically as deriving from the species of \nhuman, pig, cow and sheep\/goat (undifferentiated).  Corresponding contemporary tissues were used except \nthat the sheep and goat specimens were distinguished.   .   \n \n3. Methods  \n \nSamples of whole bone were cut transversely at the mid-shaft (approximately 5 mm in forming a ring, ~5 \nmm in height).  Each ring was cut into equal segments to obtain, flat semi-lunar shaped fragments that \npossessed endosteum and periosteum surfaces.  Our pilot studies indicated, that similar diffraction peak \nwidths to those observed for archaeological material were attained from contemporary tissue heated to  \n~600 \u00b0C.   Samples were thus heated in air to 600 \u00b0C using a carbolite tube furnace (CTF 16\/75), at a rate \nof 10 \u00b0C per minute. This temperature was then maintained for two hours after which, the furnace was \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \nallowed to cool naturally (over a period of ~ 12 hours) to room temperature.  Prior to diffraction data \ncollection, all fragments were independently pulversied using an agate pestle and mortar or a ball mill \n(Retsch MM2000). The powdered samples were then sieved through a 106 \u00b5m aperture stainless steel \nmesh.   \nX-ray diffraction data was collected using a PANalytical X\u2019Pert PRO powder diffractometer with CuK\u03b1 \nradiation. The diffraction range was 10-80\u00b0\/2\u03b8, with a step size of 0.013\u00b0\/2\u03b8 and an equivalent count time \nper step of 150 seconds. \n \n4. Data analysis \n \nDiffractogram parameterisation was performed using Topas (v4.1, Bruker-AXS).   A whole pattern \nfitting approach was employed although the unit cell contents were not refined.  Usually when employing \nsuch an approach, a smooth function is used to describe how peak widths vary with scattering angle  \n(Piga et al. 2008;  Stathopoulou at al, 2008).  We removed this constraint so that each peak was treated \nindependently.  This then enabled the determination of accurate and reliable values of diffraction peak \nshape parameters.  The structural model for apatite was based upon a hexagonal lattice (space group, \nP63\/m) as this is the most appropriate model for biological apatites that contain no long range order along \nthe OH- channels.   Crystallinity indicators based upon a single peak width (e.g. as used by Koch at al, \n1997; Hedges et al.  1995) and the Person method (Person et al. 1995) were derived for each sample.  Also \nfor comparison with previous literature, coherence lengths were calculated from the Scherrer equation \n(Klug and Alexander, 1954) after correcting the peak widths for instrumental broadening.    \nA silicon diffraction standard (NBS640c) was used to correct for instrumental broadening.  Peak shape \nanalysis was performed with some circumspection.  Peaks were excluded from subsequent analysis when \noverlapping, caused by broadening, resulted in equivocal fitting.  This was especially the case for data from \ncontemporary unheated tissue in the 2\u03b8 region 30-35o.    \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \nSimple crystallinity indicators were calculated for each diffractogram using the full width at half maximum \n(fwhm) of the apatite 002 peak and, following Person et al (1995), the resolution of the 202, 300, 211, and \n112 diffraction maxima.   As an alternative to the simple crystallinity indicators and to characterise the \napatite`s direction dependent features, we also constructed Williamson-Hall (W-H) plots (Hall and \nWilliamson, 1951; Langford et al. 1993; Rogers and Daniels, 2002) from the corrected peak widths.  Each \npoint within a W-H plot represents the broadening of a particular diffraction peak (plotted on the abscissa \nas fwhm.cos(\u03b8)) and thus represents the structural disorder along the corresponding crystallographic \ndirection.  This data was also used to calculate size and strain estimates for particular crystallographic \ndirections. Crystallite sizes were determined from W-H intercepts (size=\u03bb\/intercept) and microstrains \ndetermined from W-H gradients.   \nReproducibility for the determination of each parameter was assessed by examining intra-individual \nvariation.   Extra material (human) from archaeological and contemporary groups was prepared, treated and \nanalysed multiple times to determine the experimental repeatability. \n \n \n5. Results \n \nThe reproducibility measurements showed that the difference in repeated parameter determination was \n<1% and thus the variability observed between groups could not be ascribed to measurement error. \nDifferences between parameter values below are reported to be `significant` if, following a normality test, a \nstudents t-test p-value was found to be p<0.05. \n \n3.1 Conventional crystallinity indicators  \n \nVisual inspection of the diffractograms (e.g. Fig. 1) indicated that both archaeological and heated \nsample groups possessed peak widths that were demonstrably narrower than those of the contemporary, \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \nnative bone and broader than those of a crystalline calcium hydroxyapatite standard (NIST SRM2910).  \nFig. 1 illustrates this by presenting the diffractograms for heated and unheated samples from one bovine \nindividual and the highly crystalline, apatite standard.  Single (abscissa) and multiple peak crystallinity \nindicators (ordinate) for unheated archaeological and heated contemporary bone are presented for all \nsamples within Fig. 2.   The single peak approach was based upon the width of the 002 maxima only and \nthe multiple peak method that of Person et al (1995).  As a benchmark, the corresponding indices for the \napatite standard were determined to be  0.11 (single peak) and 1.23 (multiple peak).  For each sample group \nthere is a clear, but quantitatively different, correlation between the indices.   \n \n3.2 Direction dependence approach \n \nWilliamson-Hall plots illustrating the typical behaviour of diffraction peak widths as contemporary \nbone was heated to 600 \u00b0C is shown in Fig. 3.  Data from all species have been averaged (error bars are \nstandard errors, number of samples for each point = 15).   There is a widely scattered distribution of peak \nwidths for unheated bone indicating the marked direction dependence of the mineral crystallites' habit and \nmicrostrain.  Heating to 600 \u00b0C significantly reduces all the peak widths. This behaviour is typical of \ncontemporary bone and may be used to characterise the lattice direction dependence of any such \nrecrystallisation process. \nFig. 4 shows Williamson-Hall plots that compare archaeological bone with heated (600 \u00b0C) \ncontemporary material. There is a significant amount of dispersion within the broadening from both groups \nindicating lattice direction anisotropy in coherence length (long range lattice order).  Peak widths from the \narchaeological unheated tissue are significantly less than the corresponding contemporary bone widths \n(shown within Fig. 3).  This peak narrowing characterises the diagenetic recrystallisation, previously also \ncharacterised with the infrared 'splitting factor' (Surovell and Stiner,  2001).   Fig. 4 also serves to indicate \nthat the recrystallisation is significantly different for the heated and diagenetically altered mineral.   \nComparing the populations within Fig. 4, it is apparent that there are differences in the microstructural \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \nlattice dependence of these tissues.   Diffraction peaks arising from (hk0) planes are significantly narrower \nfor the heated than the diagenetically altered mineral whereas the 00l peaks are broader for the heated bone.    \n \n3.3 Quantification of crystallite size and strain \n \nDifferences between diagenetically altered and heated mineral may be quantified by comparing coherence \nlength ratios determined for specific crystallographic directions i.e. <00l> and <hk0>. For the \narchaeological and heated contemporary tissues these ratios (broadening of <00l >\/broadening of <hk0>) \nare 3.1\u00b1 0.3 and 2.0 \u00b10.2 respectively, indicating a significant difference (p<0.05) between the lattice \ndependent broadening of these groups.  To examine the broadening in more detail, contributions to peak \nbroadening from size and microstrain were determined from the 00l  peak widths.   Table 1 provides these \nsemi-empirical values for each of the principal bone groups averaged for all species.  The estimated errors \nbecome greater as the crystallite size increases and\/or the strain reduces as these situations both correspond \nto diffraction peaks becoming more similar in width to the instrument function.  Not surprisingly the \nunheated contemporary tissue group has the smallest crystallites possessing the largest microstrain (at least \nalong <00l >). Crystallites of the unheated archaeological group are significantly greater in size than those \nof the contemporary group and the heat treatment of both groups results in significant increases in \ncrystallite size.  Thus within the archaeological material, crystallite size increases associated with \ndiagenetic change are further compounded by heating.  However, the processes are unlikely to be simply \nadditive given the anisotropic nature of the changes that occur and the somewhat different recrystallisation \nmechanisms.  A further interesting observation is that, although heating the contemporary tissue results in a \nsignificant reduction in strain, heating the archaeological bone produces a significant increase in strain.    \n \n3.4 Species dependence \n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \nInter-species differences in microstructure were also examined.   Fig. 5 shows Williamson-Hall plots \nthat compare archaeological bone for various species.  This illustrates the interspecies magnitude of \nvariation and clearly demonstrates that the mineral of human bone possesses less disorder through all \ncrystallographic directions when compared to other species.  In particular, significant differences in hk0 \ncoherence lengths were found between the human samples and those of all other species for both unheated \narchaeological and heated (600 \u00b0C) contemporary bone.   Further significant differences could be \ndemonstrated when comparing diffraction peak width pairs (paired by crystallographic plane) between \ngroups of species.  For example, for all the archaeological tissues, each species could be discriminated on \nthe basis of peak broadening, with the exception of pig and sheep\/goat.     \n \n6. Discussion and Conclusions \n \nX-ray diffraction data have been used to contrast the crystallinity of diagenetically altered and heated \nbone mineral.   The two direction averaging methods examined were shown to be correlated but produce \nequivocal values when comparing bone mineral samples that possess significantly different direction \ndependencies.   For example, Fig. 2 illustrates that diagenetically altered and heated samples with similar \nPerson crystallinity indicator values can simultaneously possess significantly different 002 peak widths.  \nThe converse of this is also shown to be the case.  This is a direct consequence of microstructural \ndifferences between the sample groups that are obscured by the single and multiple peak approaches to \ncrystallinity determination.    This ambiguity is likely to occur if crystallinity is determined with \nspectroscopy as this also provides direction average values.  It is therefore conceivable that previous work \nusing crystallinity as a marker for preservation state (e.g. Trueman et al. 2008) may have been confounded \nby the lack of direction dependence within the analyses e.g.  microstructrual changes may be occurring \nundetected.     \nUsing a method that embraces direction dependent characteristics, it has been shown that the \nrecrystallisation processes associated with heating and diagenesis produce apatite crystallites with \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \nsignificantly different physical microstructures. In general, the diagenetically modified mineral has, on \naverage, significantly larger coherent scattering domains.     \nBone mineral crystallites have been reported previously to have rod and plate like morphologies.  In \nmost tissues there is probably a mix of both, for example reflecting local variation in carbonate \ncomposition.  Coherence lengths derived from diffraction data are a spatial average over a large population \nof crystallites, in contrast to TEM estimates that are derived from direct observation of relatively few \ncrystallites.  The data presented here shows that the diagenetically altered mineral has rod shaped coherent \ndomains with the long dimension significantly greater and the short dimension significantly less than that \nof contemporary bone heated to 600 \u00b0C.  This is in agreement with previous work where diffraction was \nused with some direction dependence to study human remains (Prieto-Castello et al. 2007).  The increase in \nstrain observed when the archaeological bone is heated may possibly be due to an increased number of \ndifferent foreign ions within the surrounding milieu becoming improperly incorporated within the lattice of \nthe recrystallised apatite.  These results serve to reinforce the thesis that, at least up to 600 \u00b0C for \ncontemporary and archeological material, the crystallite physical properties should not be direction \naveraged, but reported with lattice dependence.  Further, there are significant differences between \ncoherence length and corresponding crystallite size values for all archaeological and contemporary mineral.  \nThis is due to the lattice microstrain which is clearly an important contributor to diffraction peak \nbroadening.          \nPrevious work examining a range of modern mammalian bone and archaic human tissue did not reveal \nany significant difference between species when a single peak approach was employed (Koch et al. 1997).  \nHowever, by examining groups of paired microstructural data, we have demonstrated significant \ndifferences between species that are apparent for both the archaeological and contemporary tissues.  In \nparticular the human material is significantly different to all other species.   An exception to the species \ndiscriminating ability is that peak widths of the archaeological pig group were not significantly different to \nthat of the corresponding sheep\/goat group.  This may be due to the increased diversity in this parameter \narising as a result of combining data from sheep and goat populations.  Where goat and sheep could be \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \ntreated separately (e.g. contemporary tissues), data associated with pig were significantly different to that \nfrom both sheep and goat. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe wish to acknowledge the Cranfield Forensic Institute for provision of the analytical equipments \nused to produce the diffraction data presented here.
