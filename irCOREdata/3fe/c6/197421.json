However, empirical support on employees\u2019 perception of corporate branding is very \nlimited, particularly with respect to employees who fall outside the marketing\/branding \nfunction within their organisations. This paper explores engineering consultants\u2019 views \u2013 as \nan under-researched context \u2013 on the implications of corporate branding. Findings reveal \nengineers\u2019 views about the significance of personal brands, the implications of incorporation, \nthe ways in which corporate branding is carried out in their organizations, and associations of \ntechnical proficiency with the corporate brand. From the findings, four hypotheses have been \ndeveloped for future research.  \nKeywords: Corporate Branding, B2B Context, Engineering Consulting \n   \n4 \n \nIntroduction  \nResearch in business-to-business (B2B) branding has developed fairly rapidly over the past \ntwo decades.  While earlier studies had demonstrated the general relevance and significance \nof branding in B2B settings (Shaw et al., 1989; Mudambi et al., 1997; Mudambi, 2002; \nLynch, 2004; Shipley and Howard, 1993), more recent research has, helpfully, focused more \nspecifically on branding in different B2B contexts, such as the creative arts sector (Powell \nand Dodd, 2007), construction services (Blomb\u00e4ck and Axelsson, 2007), property (Roberts \nand Merrilees, 2007), logistic services (Davis et al., 2008) and commodity products \n(McQuiston, 2004).    \nCorporate branding, on the other hand \u2013 as a set of activities which aims to align different \nstrategic elements so that a coherent and powerful vision \u201ccasts one glow over a panoply of \nproducts\u201d rather than being diffused over individual product lines (Hatch and Schultz, 2001, \npp. 129-130) \u2013 forms a somewhat separate stream of research from that referred to above. \nWithin this stream, the financial benefits of a strong corporate brand (Glynn et al., 2007; \nKotler and Pfoertsch, 2007; Kotler et al., 2006), its economic and emotional significance for \ninternal stakeholders (under the rubric of brand equity) (Baumgarth and Schmidt, 2010; \nPersson, 2010; Burmann et al., 2009) and its significance for enhancing employability \n(Edwards, 2010; Moroko and Uncles, 2008; Backhaus and Tikoo, 2004) have been \ndemonstrated. Also, a few studies in the literature of internal branding \u2013 which is again rather \ndisconnected from the corporate branding literature \u2013 have addressed the implications of \ncorporate branding for employees (Baumgarth and Schmidt, 2010; King and Grace, 2008; \nPunjaisri and Wilson, 2007; Jurg et al., 2008; Baumgarth, 2010). \nWhile much has been said on how corporate branding should be managed to make a success, \nhowever, there is, currently, very little empirical research which investigates how the \n5 \n \ncorporate brand and its practice(s) are perceived by employees. Data from less-researched \nB2B contexts and less-studied employee bases is particularly scarce.  Moreover, extant \ncorporate branding theories are (still) largely written by, and for, (pro-) marketing scholars. \nGiven that corporate branding is supposed to engage marketing and non-marketing \nemployees in practice, it is time that non-marketing practitioners in B2B contexts are more \nactively studied for their views. The findings of this paper are in line with industrial branding \nauthors\u2019 recommendations to pursue rich, in-depth and nuanced empirical research in under-\nresearched B2B settings (Beverland et al., 2007; Lynch and Chernatony, 2007; van Riel et \nal., 2005; Sheth and Sharma, 2006; Wallace and Chernatony, 2007; de Chernatony and \nDall'Olmo Riley, 1998). \nIn this regard, engineering consultancy \u2013 as a widely neglected context with respect to \ncorporate branding \u2013 provides a valuable source of insight into how employees outside the \nconventional marketing disciplines or departments perceive the implications of corporate \nbranding to their organizations. Engineering consulting, amongst other professional services, \nis characterised by an autonomous employee base, weak structures of incorporation (resulting \nin professional partnerships), a project-based approach to work (as opposed to predefined \nfunctional departmentalization) and complex business processes (Greenwood et al., 2006). \nExtant research in knowledge-intensive sectors hardly addresses the corporate brand \nphenomenon as such and the ways in which it affects employees\u2019 attitude and behaviour \n(K\u00e4rreman and Rylander, 2008). Since employees\u2019 interpretation of their corporate brand \nreflects and determines how a consulting brand deals with its associates, a holistic \nunderstanding of B2B corporate branding along with adequate appreciation of the employee \nbase is necessary.  \n6 \n \nThe objective of this paper is, therefore, to address these gaps by providing further empirical \ninsight into extant corporate branding theories through an exploration of engineers\u2019 views on \ncorporate branding.   \nOur research is inductive in nature, facilitating the gathering of rich insights into how \nemployees in U.K.-based engineering consultancies perceive corporate branding efforts by \ntop management.  Hence, we did not enter the field with pre-determined frameworks or \nmodels, nor did we aim to test clearly-defined propositions.  On the other hand, several \nframeworks on corporate branding, personal branding, corporate identity-management and \nthe implications of the incorporation\/partnership structure for corporate brand initiatives were \nclearly highly pertinent to our study and we anticipated that at least some of the key themes \nthey explore would emerge in our fieldwork. \nSummary of Literature \nAlignment between elements of the corporate brand \nCorporate branding theories are fairly well-developed in the literature (de Chernatony, 1999; \nKnox et al., 2000; Knox and Bickerton, 2003; Urde, 2003; Hatch and Schultz, 2001; Gray \nand Balmer, 1998; Balmer and Soenen, 1999; de Chernatony and Segal-Horn, 2003). Most of \nthe theories revolve around the notion of alignment between various organizational functions, \nstakeholder views and corporate brand attributes. Hatch & Schultz (2001), for instance, \ndefine corporate branding as maintaining alignment between three main constructs: strategic \nvision, organizational culture and stakeholder image. Strategic vision is mainly associated \nwith top management\u2019s views and intentions, organizational culture is the context for \nemployees\u2019 attitude and behaviour, and image is the perception of the corporate brand held \nby external stakeholders.  According to the authors, these three strategic stars must occur \n\u201cconcurrently\u201d (p. 130) rather than in a linear, sequential fashion.  Companies must plan \n7 \n \ncarefully in order to close the \u201cvision-culture gap\u201d, the \u201cimage-culture gap\u201d as well as the \n\u201cimage-vision gap\u201d (pp. 130-132).  \nTo Urde (2003), as another example, corporate branding is about alignment between core \nvalues of the corporate brand, added values (values appreciated by external stakeholders), \nand organizational values (values lived by internally through employees\u2019 attitude, behaviour, \nand services). This implies that values need constant rejuvenation: as external values change, \ninternal values should equally adapt. Customers\u2019 values are, however, prioritized over other \nstakeholders and it is the corporate brand that should adapt with externally demanded values. \nWhilst extant theories have undoubtedly provided valuable frameworks for companies \nseeking to build a cohesive umbrella brand which can cover different products and services, \nthe concept of \u2018alignment\u2019 remains controversial and contested. Some have warned that \nalignment should not be misconceived as mere sameness (Hatch and Schultz, 2008; Schultz \net al., 2005; Holt, 2002; Charters, 2009). Others emphasize that the alignment of relationships \nand interactions between companies and their stakeholders should be a key priority for firms \n(Antorini and Andersen, 2005; Antorini and Schultz, 2005). Yet, as a rule of thumb, most \ntheorists agree that minimizing gaps between the different stakeholder perspectives upon the \ncorporate brand is a desirable goal. \nMisalignment of multiple identities: Corporate identity and the corporate brand \nAn even more fundamental question for corporate brand researchers relates to the \u201cmultiple \nidentities\u201d (Balmer and Greyser, 2002) which companies promote and communicate, \ndepending on what stage they are at, who they are aiming to communicate with and their \nstrategic goals at any point in time.  Furthermore, these multiple identities may conflict with \nhow employees see themselves and the personal values they adhere to.  Using a framework \nthey call AC2ID TestTM (ibid., 2002), the authors define five identities \u2013 actual identity, \n8 \n \ncommunicated identity, conceived identity, ideal identity and desired identity \u2013 which they \npoint out may themselves vary between different stakeholder groups.  For example, a \ncompany\u2019s \u2018communicated identity\u2019 may be perceived differently by different groups. \nAccording to the authors, top management ought to \u201cmanage identities so that they are \nbroadly consonant with each other\u201d (ibid., p. 75).  The five identities can suffer \nmisalignments and unless managers are sensitive to how key stakeholders perceive these \nmisalignments, the corporate brand can suffer considerable damage.  While the framework \nproposed by (Balmer and Greyser, 2002) powerfully illustrates the potential impacts \nmisaligned identities can have on both external as well as internal audiences, it does not offer, \nin our view, a sufficiently nuanced account of how employees outside the traditional \n\u2018marketing departments\u2019 of companies perceive top leadership\u2019s \u2018desired\u2019 identity (i.e. that \nmapped out by the CEO or the Board). \nThe question of how managers both perceive, and also communicate, the corporate brand is \nfurther discussed by de Chernatony and Dall'Olmo Riley (1998:1077).  By testing the \n\u201catomic model\u201d of the brand on brand experts \u2013 based on the attributes of \u201cfunctional \ncapability, symbolic features, service, distinctive name, ownership, shorthand notation, legal \nprotection, risk reducer and strategic direction\u201d (ibid.) \u2013 the authors discover that a much \nmore dynamic model is needed to capture their interviewees\u2019 intuitions that a brand\u2019s \nmission, values, corporate culture and heritage were also important.  Those elements, together \nwith customers\u2019 perceptions, constantly swirl and spin in tandem with changing realities. \nHence, de Chernatony and Dall'Olmo Riley (1998:1085) devise a \u201cdouble vortex model\u201d to \ncapture the synergies between corporate vision\/mission and consumers\u2019 behaviour and \nperceptions.  Their research raises intriguing questions about how other organizational \nperspectives interact with brand vision, mission and values.  In other words, more research is \n9 \n \nneeded into how such a model can be made useful when other perspectives are specified.  For \nexample, how might employees\u2019 perceptions interact with consumers\u2019 perceptions when a \nbrand\u2019s values and an organization\u2019s corporate culture come under pressure from internal or \nexternal sources?  \nThe role of middle management and employees in branding campaigns is a key concern of \nother researchers (J\u00e4rventie-Thesleff et al., 2011; Ind, 2004).  The interanimations between \ncorporate and personal brands, for instance, particularly in knowledge-intensive contexts, \nhave been discussed (Alvesson, 2004; Shepherd, 2005; Hearn, 2008).  The issue of alignment \nbetween the corporate vision and the employees\u2019 perception (as well as their perceptions of \nhow customers might react to breaches of the brand covenant) is, again, highly relevant here.  \nAs Wallace and Chernatony (2007:91) note, \u201cEmployees are the public face of the \norganisation, and their performance affects customers\u2019 interpretation of the brand\u201d. \nEmployees can, and do, sabotage the brand out of frustration, fear and\/or work-related stress \n(Wallace and de De Chernatony 2007; Ind, 2004).   \nPartnership and Incorporation \nFinally, the corporate brand undergoes specific changes in professional services contexts.  A \nrich body of literature has explored the engineering consulting sector, particularly from the \nOrganization Studies (OS) perspective (Alvesson, 2000; Alvesson and K\u00e4rreman, 2004; \nKunda, 2006; Carmeli and Waldman, 2009; Jennings et al., 2009; Whittington et al., 2009; \nStarbuck, 1992). However, special attention to this context with respect to corporate branding \nis scarce. Nuanced empirical evidence, instead of a few extant anecdotal accounts, is required \nto illuminate the implications of corporate branding in the context of engineering consulting. \nIn this regard, Greenwood and Empson (2003) and Greenwood et al. (2006) have discussed \nextensively the intrinsic tensions between the two organizing forms of Incorporation and \n10 \n \nProfessional Partnership within knowledge-intensive contexts. While the former is associated \nwith integrative efforts, standardization of processes, and total communication, the latter is \ncalled upon to maintain individual (and collective) autonomy, flexibility, and ownership. \nHence, corporate branding which, by definition, well resonates with the notion of \nincorporation, is no exception in terms of its tensions with employees\u2019 efforts in pursuit of \nsustaining professional partnership. This paper sheds further light on such tensions. \nBased on the summary of literature, this paper aims to investigate how employees perceive \ncorporate branding. Since it is clear that further empirical research is needed, the perceptions \nof engineering consultants, as an under-researched internal stakeholder base, are sought for \ntheir views on how they view the corporate brand and their relationship to it and the various \ncorporate branding activities undertaken by their organisations.  The research gaps referred to \nabove which our paper addresses are summarized in Table 1. \nTable 1: Gaps identified in the literature with respect to the contributions of the paper \nAuthors Research Gaps \n(Hatch and Schultz, 2001; de \nChernatony and Segal-Horn, 2003; \nInd, 2004; Hatch and Schultz, \n2003; Balmer and Greyser, 2003) \nCorporate branding conduct \u2013 i.e. the way corporate \nbranding should be carried out and managed in practice \n\u2013 and its implications for employees have remained \nsomewhat vague, particularly in the engineering \nconsulting context \n(Ind, 2004; Schultz and Hatch, \n2003) \nThe role and significance of the corporate brand as \ncompared to technical knowledge have been \nunderstated \n(Alvesson, 2004; Alvesson and \nK\u00e4rreman, 2004) \nThe role of personal brands in relation to the corporate \nbrand have been under-imagined and under-researched \n(Greenwood et al., 2006; \nGreenwood and Empson, 2003) \nThe implications of incorporation for corporate \nbranding have been understated \n \n11 \n \nResearch Aims and Methodology \nBased on the existing deficiencies in the literature, we wanted to explore how engineers in \nconsultancies perceive corporate branding within their organisations and how they make \nsense of the different elements of the corporate brand.  The central research question, \ntherefore, is how engineers perceive corporate branding and its implications.  \nTo avoid imposing any presumptions on employees and to deploy rich and nuanced data, an \ninductive qualitative approach was adopted for this enquiry. A case study design was chosen \nin order to elicit a more nuanced understanding of how corporate branding activities are \nperceived by engineering consultants based on real-life accounts of their experiences. Case \nstudy design is suitable when theorization of the phenomenon under study and the key \nconstructs or themes are yet to be identified (Stake, 2005; Gummesson, 2000; Gummesson, \n2005; Yin, 2003).  \nThe case study was carried out within the UK arm of a multi-national engineering consulting \nfirm. A total of 14 semi-structured and in-depth interviews, along with opportunistic \nobservation, were the main means of collecting insights in three regional offices in the UK. \nAll interviews were carried out one-to-one and face-to-face; these lasted between 30 to 80 \nminutes. Informants were selected from across grades and specifications; they were mainly \nmales since the engineering profession in the U.K. still tends to be dominated by men (Tonso, \n2006).  Informants are referred to by codes in the remainder of the paper; a stratified sample \nof five graduate (WG1-5), five senior (WS1-5) and four director (WD1-4) engineers was \nobtained with comparatively equal distribution of informants at each level.  Over the course \nof three months, key senior managers in London as well as the three participating regional \noffices were interviewed. This commitment from the senior management was achieved on the \nbasis that the findings were likely to be of managerial and strategic significance to the firm\u2019s \n12 \n \ncorporate branding activities. Financial support during the research was granted by university \nof Leicester, School of Management.    \nAccess was a particular challenge because, as the directors emphasized repeatedly to us, \nengineers\u2019 time is rather highly-priced. To encourage reflection and enhance authenticity, \nmanagers were referred to corporate brand artefacts and initiatives during interview sessions. \nThey were also asked to share suggestions and stories of success or failure due either to \n\u2018good\u2019 or \u2018poor\u2019 practices of corporate branding and to articulate their reasons for any \ncynicism they might feel with regard to the notion or practice of corporate branding.  \nInterviews were transcribed and codified thoroughly with the aid of qualitative data analysis \nsoftware Nvivo 7.0.; One of the limitations in using qualitative data analysis software, as \nTesch (1990) notes, is the risk of imposing rigid codes on interview accounts and suppressing \nmultiplicity of interpretation. Hence, multiple codes were assigned to interview texts. Also, \ncodes were further interpreted by both authors. During the coding process, excerpts from the \ninterviews were used as code titles as much as possible to let the data speak for itself instead \nof imposing structures influenced by pre-understanding from the theory (Tesch, 1990). An \nexample of the coding procedure is given in Figure 3.  Using the software facilitated efficient \nmanagement of rich source of data and helped better integrating and presenting the \nmultiplicity of themes emerged from the data. It also made subsequent interpretations easier \nthrough its advanced search, reporting and comparison features.  \nIn conducting our analyses of the data, we were guided by what Alvesson (2011) calls \n\u2018reflexive pragmatism\u2019. Reflexive pragmatism is often deployed in marketing and industrial \ncontexts where in-depth information is sought and provides a key for the critical assessment \nof interviews. It helps the researcher not only to grasp the contextual meanings of the talks \nand the social setting within which a conversation takes place, but also to cautiously go \n13 \n \nbeyond the actual setting to identify more transferrable insights and to assess authenticity and \ntrustworthiness in respondents\u2019 statements without an exaggerated concern for \u2018truth\u2019 or \nrigour. \nFigure1: An extract of coding procedures using NVivo \n \nWRJ Engineering Consultants2\nThe site of investigation was three regional offices of WRJ consultants in the UK. A few \nyears ago, the WRJ group, an already well-established Nordic engineering consultant of a \nfew thousand employees, acquired SMB consultants, another well-established UK-based \ninternational consulting of a few hundred employees. While WRJ was mainly active in the \ninfrastructure, energy and construction, SMB was known for its excellence in building and \ndesign. After the acquisition SMB was rebranded as WRJ-SMB for two years and then the \nSMB sub-brand was eliminated.  Currently, the merged entity is known simply as WRJ (UK).  \n: Case Background \n                                                 \n2 All names, including company and interviewee names, are anonymised for ethical reasons.  \n14 \n \nThis acquisition has had some mutual benefits, as well as difficulties for both consultancies in \nterms of corporate image and branding. The WRJ Group, despite its large size, had by and \nlarge remained a Nordic player prior to the acquisition. Following the acquisition, it managed \nto break through its Nordic image and to enhance its international presence, mostly by \nleveraging on the established international presence of SMB.  Similarly, SMB has enjoyed \nmuch larger-scale projects involving more diverse engineering expertise as a result of its \nacquisition by WRJ. \nFindings \nEngineering consulting is significantly distinctive from other business sectors in terms of it \nmanagement structure (Filiatrault and Lapierre, 1997). This is partly due to the nature of \nengineering consulting projects: they tend to be unique in every instance (thus requiring \nhighly individualized, customized solutions and expertise), defined through very close \ncollaboration with the client(s) and other partners, demand high levels of technical \nknowledge and creativity, demand on-site presence by the consultancy or consultancies \ncommissioned for the project and closely supervised for strict adherence to established codes \nof safety and practicality (Alvesson, 2004; Downey and Lucena, 2004). All these yield \nsignificant implications for the corporate branding of engineering consulting firms. \nCorporate versus Personal Branding \nIt has already been noted that, in the engineering consultancy setting \u2013 as a highly specialized \ncontext where niche expertise is called for \u2013 employees build up significant relationships with \nclients and develop brands of their own. Clients are careful, even choosy, in their assessments \nof  employees who are involved in a consultancy project due to the scale and scope of work \ninvolved. It is very common to include engineers\u2019 names and their resum\u00e9s on a formal \n15 \n \nwritten proposal to clients. These personal brands can then become at par with the corporate \nbrand (WD4, WD3).   \nIt was highlighted by engineers interviewed that the significance of personal brands increases \nat more senior levels \u2013 i.e. director level or above (WD4, WS5). Therefore, a director\u2019s brand \nand his team play a key role in the buying behaviour of clients. The significance of personal \nbrands also depends on the projects\u2019 size, as the role of employee brands can be offset the \nbigger in size the project is (WD4, WS5).  \nAnother determining factor was reported to be the clients\u2019 personal preferences and their \nvalues. Some clients might, due to cultural characteristics, value personal relationships more \nthan the corporate brand behind the employees\u2019 personal brands (WS1, WD2, and WD3). It \nwas noted by most of the directors and senior engineers that the British market is \ncharacterized by ascribing particular attention to personal (still technically-oriented) \nrelationships above corporate brands particularly in small to medium scale projects. We thus \narrived at the first of our propositions: \nP1. The personal brand(s) of employees in professional B2B settings can threaten to override \nthe corporate brand, leading to confusion in external stakeholders\u2019 minds.  \nIncorporation \nIt was noted that companies \u201ctend to become more of the organization, more of a delivery \nbody rather than something that\u2019s changing and thinks a lot\u201d (WS5) in their transition \ntowards incorporation from the traditional partnership style. WS1 and WD1 also associated \nincorporation with \u2018dehumanization of the company\u2019. \nWG4 and WD1 also criticised corporate branding initiatives, those that excessively carry \nrules of incorporation, of exerting destructive limitations to some everyday business \n16 \n \nprocesses. Corporate branding initiatives, as a \u2018vehicle\u2019 for further incorporation, were \nequally criticised for dictating specific guidelines internally for engineers to abide by when \napproaching clients and bidding for projects that are not always \u2018helpful\u2019. Part of the issue, \nwas noted to be that regional employees will have to deal with much bigger sums of \ninformation, not always necessarily relevant, about the corporate information \u201cwhich can at \ntimes be stressful\u201d (WD1). More importantly, some corporate branding initiatives had often \ncarried unnecessary, irrelevant and destructive impressions of being \u2018big enough not to care \nenough\u2019 or \u2018big enough not to be flexible enough\u2019 (WD1, WG4). A regional director, in \nreflection towards the corporate brand protocols, further explained the intricacies involved in \nthis regard, referring to a standardized presentational package initiated by WRJ group \ncommunication centre to be used by regional offices when approaching prospective clients: \n\u201cI think... the worry is... that in a big chunk of the presentation, your personality is \nsort of taken out of it because I think ... some of the slides are quite definite. You \ndon\u2019t want to joke about them or undermine them in any way, but it\u2019s quite difficult to \nget your personality across and I think a lot of what we do is about providing a \npersonal service and is about how people respond to you because quite often ... they \njust happen to like the person who came to the interview and think, \u201cI would trust that \nperson to do my building\u201d. (WD1)  \nThis also refers to the role of personal brands, as discussed earlier, whereby incorporation \ndilutes the influential role of personal brands. It was also outlined that associations of \nincorporation, such as connotations of size, can do more harm than favour when it comes to a \nlocal or regional level collaboration with prospective clients: \n\u201c...so, you have sort of this big, big thing sort of floating around like a big airship or \nsomething just hovering there and you have to refer to it \u2026 all the time ... It\u2019s \n17 \n \ncompletely benign ... and if anything it\u2019s probably good in a lot of ways because it \ndoes give people confidence at their strength and certainly from like a financial point \nof view and we\u2019ve got plenty of access to lots of skills. Yet, you do feel a bit like a \nhammer trying to crack a nut.\u201d  (WD1) \nThe corporate brand was therefore criticised since, most often than not, the local and regional \ncontact points \u2013 or \u2018partners\u2019 in the professional partnership term \u2013 do not necessarily need to \nrefer to the largesse or luxury associated with a monolithic corporate brand image. Instead, \nthey need to be empowered sufficiently to be able to keep their local contacts lively and tailor \ntheir marketing and branding activities locally, at least to an appropriate degree. In this \nregard, some (WG4, WS1, WD1, and WS5) noted that the extant cooperate branding \nprotocols mostly lack a local twist which clients value very much. Connotations of \u2018bigness\u2019 \nwere also reported to frighten the clients, at times, thinking \u201cwell you\u2019re too big; you won\u2019t \nbe interested in our job\u201d (WG4). This is especially significant given the service nature of the \nbusiness as well as the British engineering relationships that demand high levels of personal \ncare, transparency and local presence (WD3). Based on these findings, our second \nproposition is: \nP2. Incorporative activities that bear connotations of \u2018bigness\u2019, \u2018dehumanization\u2019 or \n\u2018steadiness\u2019 can undermine the corporate brand in the mind of employees as well as external \nstakeholders.   \nCorporate Branding Conduct \nIt became evident in the investigations that one of the most significant burdens in engaging \nemployees with the corporate brand is, simply put, that corporate branding \u2018campaigns\u2019 were \nnot compelling enough. In a few interviews it was noted that some engineers, as \nrepresentatives, had been consulted about the initiatives (WD3, WG1); yet, they were \n18 \n \nstrongly on the belief that the engineers\u2019 comments had hardly been affected the corporate \nbranding approach in place (WS5, WS1). \nHence, corporate branding initiatives had remained a \u201cbenign\u201d set of activities at best (WD1), \nsomething no one would even bother criticising (WS5). Some believed that corporate \nbranding campaigns were excessively standardized and lacked humanistic and social \nambience (WS1, WD1). Others noted that corporate branding initiatives fail to appreciate the \nsubstantive cultural, occupational, and geographical differences across the firm and that the \ninitiatives had been designed in pursuit of \u2018integration\u2019 at any cost without devoting enough \nthought to nuanced differences (WS5, WG4).  \nIt was also noted by four senior engineers that at times the corporate branding initiatives had \nbeen in clash with the extant business procedures, breached by several inconsistent corporate \nbehaviours, or that turf battles had undermined corporate branding messages. CS5 \nhighlighted this by referring to an ethical reservation about the places wherein the company \ncarries out projects without exerting due sensitiveness to labour conditions in those countries: \n\u201c... It\u2019s like politicians saying back to basics and then realizing they have an \naffair\u2026you got to be very careful\u2026about standing up and giving all these values \u2026 I \ndon\u2019t have a problem with it, because personally I like the idea of having those \nvalues, but what those values means is saying \u2018No\u2019. If you gonna have things like that, \nyou got to be able to say \u2018we are not working there, or if we are working there, it\u2019s \nunder these conditions\u2019...Now, good, I agree with all that, yeah, but I also know that \nwe work in Libya. Ok?\u201d \nIn addition, where the content of corporate branding initiatives has been fabricated, where it \nis being \u2018aired\u2019 from and the fact that there has been almost no voice in devising it in the first \nplace for engineers \u2013 all contributed to the lack of motivation in engaging with the initiatives. \n19 \n \nBesides, the five graduate engineers mentioned that having experienced the same conventions \nin their previous tenures make them consider all this \u201cas a given\u201d. In another case, it was \nnoted that it is difficult for engineers to see how branding affects the way they proceed \n(WG2, WS1, and WG4):  \n\u201cIt\u2019s on the wall for the clients. It is a marketing tool rather than it being inherent in \nevery employee\u201d (WS1). \nNonetheless, there were some interesting propositions made by engineers in order to make \ncorporate branding more efficient, engaging and influential. A regional director asserted that \nhe had started to develop and apply his own local version of corporate branding in terms of \ndefining vision and identity in light of the overall guidelines defined by the corporation. \nHaving adopted this approach and regarding the group corporate brand initiatives he noted:  \n\u201cI can\u2019t really influence them, but I can then influence how that\u2019s applied within the \nUK, but I can\u2019t change group direction on that\u201d. (WD3) \nThe general initiatives were reported to be usually broad (and vague) enough to allow such \nlocal adaptation. With respect to the contents of initiatives, an engineer noted that he would \nbe far keener to see \u201ca bit more about what the company actually is\u201d (WG4), what other \noffices are doing, what are the facts and figures, who are the people, what project they are \ndoing, and what are the capabilities particularly at the local level, instead of mere \n\u2018management speak\u2019. \nAt the same time, employees were not wholly indifferent to, or negative towards, the \ncorporate brand, at least not in a straightforward way.  Some senior managers as well as \ngraduate engineers indicated that they identified with their job or the kind of projects they \nwere involved in instead of the corporate brand. Some serious reactions had also taken place \n20 \n \nin response to unfavourable, \u2018meaningless\u2019 or authoritarian initiatives. For instance, the \nBritish communication team was actually forced to leave the group following the acquisition, \ndue to a mismatch between the corporate branding strategies of the two firms.  \nInterestingly, some graduate engineers recalled very clearly the value word \u201cexcellence\u201d, \nalthough it was not among the five stated value words in the official \u2018corporate philosophy\u2019 \nstatement.  \u201cExcellence\u201d appeared to resonate well with engineers not only because everyone \ncould easily recall the person \u2013 the Managing director (MD) \u2013 who had underscored it \nconstantly during monthly meetings, but also because the implications of \u2018excellence\u2019 in the \nengineering processes had been clearly articulated along with real-world examples by the MD \n(WG4, WS2). It could be inferred that corporate branding was adopted as the \u2018grammar\u2019 for \npower discourse and that power element had directly influenced the efficiency and \nacceptance of initiatives.  \nIt is also worth noting that almost all respondents failed to recall the five value words \npostulated in the \u2018corporate philosophy\u2019. At best, they could only recall two out of the five \nwords, despite having received extensive \u2018brand training\u2019 provided by the company.  As one \nsenior engineer \u2018confessed\u2019: \n\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t even know the brand\u2026 {Laughing}, the five elements that we\u2019re \nsupposed to be selling\u2026 yeah that\u2019s true. I live my own definition of the brand. I \nguess I have defined the brand in my own way and that\u2019s what I feel I\u2019m selling \nwhich, yeah, is a gap\u2026\u201d (WS1) \nDespite gaps between how the corporate brand was communicated and how it was \ninterpreted, the corporate brand studied was reported by engineers to be still \u2018meaningful\u2019 \u2013 \nand not meaningless \u2013 in terms of image and personality. The problem was in their being able \nto present a holistically meaningful brand to customers.  To the managers, the WRJ corporate \n21 \n \nbrand was associated with particular types of engineering projects that were in clear contrast \nwith those espoused by SMB in the past. Whereas SMB was recalled by graduate and senior \nengineers as \u2018creative\u2019, \u2018glitzy\u2019, \u2018challenging\u2019, \u2018self-generating\u2019, \u2018questioning\u2019, \u2018varied\u2019 and \n\u2018exciting\u2019, WRJ was referred to as being \u2018standard\u2019, \u2018steady\u2019, \u2018less exciting\u2019, \u2018safe\u2019, \u2018able\u2019, \n\u2018competent\u2019, \u2018grown-up\u2019, \u2018reliable\u2019, \u2018big\u2019 and \u2018generic\u2019. Our third and fourth research \npropositions, are, therefore: \nP3. Corporate branding initiatives that are carried out extensively from the top down risk \nalienating employees and their specialist talents and expertise, thus hurting the corporate \nbrand. \nP4. Corporate branding initiatives which fail to engage employees fully run the risk of losing \nbrand consistency and control.   \nThe Corporate Brand versus Technical Knowledge \nA common theme throughout the case study was that the corporate brand \u2018at the end of the \nday\u2019 is less significant to the company than technical expertise. This view was presented by \none director, who, in response to a question about a corporate brand statement, noted: \n\u201c...because we deal with very sort of tangible things and steel and concrete and big \nthings and they\u2019re sort of quite serious safety issues going on, on site, you know, \nwe\u2019re not going to get upset by a few words. You know, it\u2019s sort of not that important \nat the end of the day and I think there is a bit of humour there, as well, possibly.\u201d \n(WD1) \nHowever, the corporate brand was not entirely insignificant either, as outlined in all \ninterviews. On average, in response to the question of \u201chow much of your success is indebted \n22 \n \nto the corporate brand and how much to technical expertise, if you want to provide a \npercentage?\u201d, a 40-60 split was offered in favour of technical excellence.  \nSimilarly, engineers also appeared better prepared to engage with the technical attributes of \nthe corporate brand (e.g. its reputation for technical excellence or the kind of projects the \ncompany had been involved in) than with the presentational aspects (e.g. logo, colour and \nother presentational codes).  Therefore, we propose that: \nP5.  Because engineering consultancies rely on technical excellence, engineers show greater \nreliance on the technical, rather than the presentational, aspects of the corporate brand.  \nDiscussion  \nIt is evident from our findings that there is a certain degree of suppressed rivalry in place \nbetween the two brand types \u2013 the corporate brand and the personal brand(s).  This \nmanifested in identity struggles on the engineers\u2019 part in pursuit of maintaining individuality \nas well as in the discomfort expressed by engineers in coping with business process reforms \naimed at standardizing reporting and knowledge management systems.  In such a scenario, \nthe personal brand of the consultant would sometimes come into conflict, or be misaligned \nwith, the corporate brand.  Over time, this misalignment can have knock-on effects on the \ncorporate brand, further intensifying gaps between the corporate vision and organizational \nculture and, thereby, affecting external stakeholders\u2019 perceptions of the corporate brand \n(Hatch and Schultz, 2001). \nThe force of personal brands can, of course, be aligned with the corporate brand and create \nsynergy as well (Greenwood et al., 2006). On the flip side, however, it can create hidden or \nopen clashes. This resonates with the increased likelihood of a whole division\u2019s departure \nwhen senior members tend to depart (Alvesson and K\u00e4rreman, 2004). In the case studied, the \n23 \n \nfirm\u2019s and projects\u2019 size appeared to mitigate this force and suppress (at least temporarily) \nmore open struggles at the employee levels that can threaten the corporate brand. \nMorale can also be affected when senior managers feel that the corporate brand does not \naccommodate their personal brand value (\u201cyour personality is sort of taken out of it\u201d).  In this \ncase, the engineers felt they had to define the brand their own way.  As a result, many of them \nfelt that their \u2018personal brands\u2019 were either on par with, or surpassed, the corporate brand. A \nkey implication of this finding is that the personal brand(s) of employees threaten to override \nthe corporate brand, leading to confusion in external stakeholders\u2019 minds (Hatch and Schultz, \n2001; Balmer and Greyser, 2002).  \nWe also found that misalignments between corporate and personal brands have ethical \nimplications.  This finding throws into relief the difficulties professional services firms can \nface in selecting which projects to take on. It has been noted that managing multiple identities \nis a major challenge for companies (Balmer and Greyser, 2002), and our findings confirm this \ninsight. At the same time, these accounts show that employees can often be the first to feel \nthe discomfort of ethical misalignments between ideal identity (the corporate vision) and \nconceived identity (the corporate brand), even before other key stakeholders (such as \ncustomers) are made aware of them (\u201cgood, I agree with all that, but I also know we work in \nLibya. Ok?\u201d).   \nThe way corporate branding campaigns are carried out is one of the main elements that can \nlink corporate branding and internal branding (Ind, 2004). Engaging corporate brand conduct \ncan also encourage authentic \u2018alignment\u2019 between employees and the corporate brand leading \nto \u2018living-the-brand\u2019 on the employees\u2019 part (Ind, 2004). However, more often than not, more \nattention is being given to form rather than content (Olins, 2003). Our understanding is that \n24 \n \nadopting a conventional, uneducated, or contextually-inappropriate approach to corporate \nbranding can become in itself the root cause of disengagement and fragmentation. \nAdopting conventional, old-fashioned and uninteresting corporate branding initiatives had at \nmany times discouraged engineers from active participation. This appeared to be partly \nbecause these initiatives were designed by non-engineers \u2013 i.e. by external branding \nconsultants or internal communication executives or a combination thereof \u2013 and in an \nexcessively top-down manner. It could be inferred that, this was due to a problematic \npresupposition (or lack of confidence) that engineers are marketing- and branding-illiterates \nand therefore it is more efficient (or easier) to take a top-down approach. In devising \ninitiatives, \u2018the top\u2019 is usually senior managers (supplanted by external consultants) who are \nrather cut off from the lower tiers (Ind, 2004; Burmann et al., 2008; Burmann and Zeplin, \n2005). \nEngineers were thus, for the most part, uncommitted to the corporate brand vision (Wallace \nand Chernatony, 2007). So, while one director admitted that he would not actively sabotage \ncorporate brand communications (\u201cyou don\u2019t want to joke about them or undermine them in \nany way\u201d), he still felt the size of an incorporated entity militated against the specific \nexpertise individual consultants could offer clients.  A corollary of this finding is that \nengineers felt disengaged with branding initiatives not necessarily because they did not \nbelieve in them but rather because they (the initiatives) lacked local relevance and resonance. \nThis finding further illuminates existing brand models which demonstrate the importance of \ncapturing brand mission, heritage and stakeholder value (de Chernatony and Dall'Olmo Riley, \n1998).  Where the corporate brand did resonate with engineers, it was because they were \nbeing reminded of words like \u2018excellence\u2019 on a regular basis in formal meetings and by top \nmanagement (MD) rather than through planned branding campaigns.  It appears that work-\n25 \n \nfocused meetings might be a more effective way of communicating the corporate brand \nvalues rather than trying to get professionals trained in what the corporate brand should look \nor sound like or what one graduate engineer called \u2018management-speak\u2019. \nThe tension between the two opposing organizing structures of Professional Partnership and \nIncorporation with respect to corporate branding also emerged in the findings. Intrinsic to the \nway consulting firms classically operate is the autonomous employee base via a loose and \norganic structure binding knowledge arms or conglomerates together known as professional \npartners (Greenwood and Empson, 2003). This is mainly due to the knowledge-based nature \nof business processes. An adequate level of autonomy is, therefore, necessary for the \nknowledge-arms (being individual knowledge workers or small collectives as business units \nwithin and across the firms in a network) to best put their creative and professional ideas in \nplace. \nSuch an autonomous orientation, however, clashes with the tendencies towards incorporation. \nAs firms get bigger \u2013 and given the companies\u2019 intentions to manage knowledge and to \nstandardize ordinary processes (such as reporting or finance and the technical processes that \nare common among various projects) in order to achieve managerial efficiencies \u2013\nincorporation is typically an almost inevitable option (Greenwood and Empson, 2003). \nIncorporation is also associated with increased bureaucratic characteristics and beard \nconnotations of slowness, steadiness and regularity while partnership was associated with \nautonomy, creativity and agility. Elements from the two were, however, in place and in \ntandem in a complementary manner. \n26 \n \nTheoretical Contributions \nThis paper brings substantive theoretical contributions to the table. First, it reveals new \naspects to, and implications of, corporate branding as perceived by middle and senior \nmanagers in an engineering consulting setting. Based on our findings, five research \npropositions have been generated which correspond to the interactions between personal and \ncorporate brands, the brand implications of incorporation, the ethics of personal versus \ncorporate branding conduct and the importance of technical proficiency to the corporate \nbrand.  All these provide rich directions for further investigation in other knowledge-\nintensive contexts.  \nIn terms of the relationship between the personal and the corporate brand, our paper confirms \nthat the personal brand of the consultant can override that of the corporate brand, leading to a \nseries of unintended consequences for the firm or parent company.  These consequences \ninclude, but are not limited to, the risks associated with misalignments between corporate \nbrand values and personal brand values (Hatch and Schultz, 2008; Schultz et al., 2005; Holt, \n2002; Charters, 2009). \nFurthermore, our research contributes to extant research in knowledge-intensive sectors on \nthe corporate brand phenomenon and the ways in which employees react to it (K\u00e4rreman and \nRylander, 2008) by showing that the tensions between the personal brand of knowledge \nprofessionals and the corporate brand of the firm increases with increased seniority of \nemployees.  We have also shown that the size of the corporation matters greatly: the larger \nthe parent group of companies, the greater the danger that local and\/or regional contact points \nare lost.  Our findings in this area lend credence and specificity to the argument by Wallace \nand  Chernatony (2007) that employees represent the corporate brand but can also sabotage it.  \n27 \n \nInterestingly, as we have discovered, employees may not set out deliberately to sabotage the \ncorporate brand; they may simply fall \u2018out of sync\u2019 with it.    \nAs shown by this study, one of the reasons for the disenchantment with, or disengagement \nfrom the corporate brand lies in how the partnership\/incorporation transition is managed \n(Greenwood et al., 2006; Greenwood and Empson, 2003).  Incorporation can threaten \nemployees\u2019 sense of belonging to a cohesive and unique company and undermine their sense \nof the corporate brand, however that is defined.  It can also threaten regional or local contacts \nand the sense of intimacy which clients seek.  This breach between employees\u2019 identity and \nthat of the corporate brand is intensified in service settings where transparency is highly \nvalued.  As our informants emphasized repeatedly, being seen to adhere to espoused values in \npractice is fundamentally important in professional service settings.  \nThus, ethical reservations on the part of employees play a significant role in how they \ninterpret and respond to organizational values.  As we have seen, informal observations of the \ncompany\u2019s inconsistent behaviours with respect to official standards are enough to distance \nemployees in knowledge-intensive sectors from the corporate brand. When this happens, \nemployees in such contexts may choose to focus on their \u2018own\u2019 projects or on developing \ntheir own version of branding rather than go with the corporate narrative.  Urde (2003) argues \nthat corporate branding is about aligning corporate values with the lived, internal values of \nemployees.  Our findings contribute to this and similar insights by showing that efforts at \nalignment need to take into account the ethical dimension of organizational value-building \nrather than just attempt to refresh the corporate brand for its own sake.   \nRelatedly, our study sheds further empirical light on extant corporate branding theories by \nrevealing manifestations of misalignment either with respect to identities or values among \ninternal stakeholders \u2013 i.e. employees and top management \u2013 that can undermine the \n28 \n \ncorporate brand.  That is, not only can there be cognitive dissonance between employees\u2019 \nprofessional identities and those of the corporation, there can also be tensions between \ndifferent levels of the corporation.  When this happens, the cynical reflections of engineers \ncan, and are, constructively deployed by them to illuminate the shortcomings of corporate \nbranding in practice: this is described by them in terms of failures in (controlled) brand \ncommunication, initiatives, and conduct. Thus, our study also reveals nuanced expressions of \nculture-vision, actual-desired, conceived-communicated, and core-organizational value gaps, \nthus contributing both to the model proposed by Hatch and Schultz (2001) and that presented \nby Balmer and Greyser (2002). \nLast, but not least, we have shown that the corporate brand construct itself in B2B contexts is \nsomewhat more nuanced than the literature might lead us to expect. What our findings show \nis that professional services firms rely heavily on technical aspects of excellence, more so \nthan on brand awareness and relevance among stakeholder groups.  For this reason, the \nengineers in our study identified more readily with the specialist competencies they have \nbeen trained to deliver to clients rather than with brand personality and promise (Kotler et al., \n2006; Ohnemus, 2009).  \nTable 2 more explicitly summarizes the theoretical contributions of this paper. \nTable 2: Theoretical contributions of the paper \nArticle Contribution \n(Hatch and Schultz, 2001; Balmer and \nGreyser, 2002) \nDemonstrates manifestations of \nmisalignment between culture-vision \nperspectives, as well as actual-desired, and \nconceived-communicated identity types \n(K\u00e4rreman and Rylander, 2008; Urde, 2003; \nInd, 2004) \nDemonstrates manifestations of \nmisalignment between core (corporate brand) \nand organizational (actually \u2018lived\u2019) values \n29 \n \n(Alvesson, 2004; Shepherd, 2005; Alvesson \nand K\u00e4rreman, 2004) \nProvides nuanced account of the tensions \nbetween personal brands and the corporate \nbrand \n(Greenwood et al., 2006; Greenwood and \nEmpson, 2003) \nProvides nuanced account of tensions \nbetween incorporation and professional \npartnership from the perspective of corporate \nbranding.  \n(Kotler et al., 2006; Ohnemus, 2009) Levels the association of corporate brand and \ntechnical proficiency in engineering-intensive \ncontexts \n \nManagerial implications \nThis research has significant managerial implications from various perspectives.  It has given \nrise to four central elements B2B companies need to consider when engaging in corporate \nbranding \u2013 namely personal brands, incorporative activities, corporate branding conduct and \ntechnical expertise. It helps managers understand the constellation and implications of \nmentioned elements towards creating a clear corporate brand that can serve internal as well as \nexternal stakeholders. Managers should be alert to the significant role of personal brands and \nattempt to utilize them in order to create synergy. Furthermore, corporate branding activities \nthat are in line with incorporative attempts should be devised, communicated and put in place \nwith caution so that individuality, local adaptation, and autonomy of employees are not \ndiluted. The initiatives themselves, such as value words, mission statements or training \nmaterials should also be in engineers\u2019 \u2018language\u2019. In other words, instead of educating \nengineers on the branding materials developed by marketers or corporate brand consultants, it \nis better to engage them from the very beginning in the building of corporate branding \ninitiatives \u2013 i.e. engineers doing the corporate branding from A to Z.  \n30 \n \nSuch efforts and, and perhaps should, be facilitated by corporate branding consultants. For \nexample, instead of communicating the value word \u201csustainable\u201d, a picture of an example of \na sustainable building project with a brief introduction next to it that explains the advantages \nof a sustainable building project can work more effectively for aligning personal and \ncorporate brand values than text consisting of three or five value words. Brand values, in \nother words, need to come alive for engineers in a way which acknowledges their technical \nexpertise as well as their personal expression of that expertise.  Further, corporate brands \nneed to be flexible enough to accommodate highly localized contexts and individual \npreferences.  In fact, many of our interviewees were already acting upon their own initiative, \nwhile trying hard to buy into the corporate brand itself (\u201cI have defined the brand in my own \nway\u2026yeah (that is) a gap\u2026\u201d). \nMoreover, technical expertise and corporate branding activities should not be considered as \ntwo opposing or even separate constructs. The two are complementary in the way that the \nformer feeds the latter. Prioritising one over another is therefore problematic since a strong \nengineering consulting corporate brand is no different than delivering long-term and \nsustainable technical excellence.   \nConclusions   \nWhen we first embarked upon this piece of research and spoke to colleagues about it, we \nwere confronted with views along the lines of: \u2018engineers don\u2019t care about branding and why \nshould they?\u2019 and \u2018don\u2019t engineers think branding is for the marketing department to \nhandle?\u2019.  We were driven by such views to find out what engineers themselves actually think \nabout corporate branding.      \nBy including engineers\u2019 views of the corporate brand in our study of branding in the B2B \ncontext, our study has shown how important employees\u2019 personal brands can be in these \n31 \n \ncontexts.   Contrary to popular misconceptions about the lack of regard engineers have about \nsubjects like corporate branding, we discovered that this group of professionals were deeply \nengaged with, and knowledgeable about, what it was and how it helped them and the \ncompany they worked for.  Our work, therefore, debunks the myth that corporate branding \nhas little relevance or importance to engineers and with regard to engineering-intensive \ncontexts.    Extant literature is heavily characterised by engineering-marketing dichotomy in a \nway that it suppresses engineers\u2019 voices when it comes to the theory and practice of \nmarketing and branding. \nWe argue that just the opposite approach needs to be adopted. In our opinion, (cynical) \nengineers are rich sources of insight not only for corporate branding, but more generally for \nother industrial marketing disciplines, both from a theoretical as well as empirical \nperspective. In our view, branding of engineering contexts in the literature lags behind the \nadvancements of branding in practice of engineering consulting firms. We would like to \nsuggest that engineering consulting firms, while acknowledging extant corporate branding \ntheories, should continue to innovate upon their own versions of corporate branding in \npractice. Part of our rationale for making this assertion is because the majority of extant \ncorporate branding theories have developed from business-to-consumer settings, even today. \nMuch more needs to be done to arrive at a point where corporate branding theories meet the \nspecificities of the engineering consulting context.  In this regard, we also recommend more \ncritical qualitative research that can grasp the rich intricacies, scepticism, and resistances \nwhich emerge to corporate branding activities in B2B settings.   \nIndeed, we contend that any cynicism about the corporate branding process in these \norganisations can, contrary to expectations, provide valuable insights into how corporate \ncommunications can be better managed, particularly in \u2018macho\u2019 settings like the construction, \n32 \n \nshipping or engineering sectors where branding may be regarded as a frivolous, or at best, \nsecondary, priority to service delivery.   \nFuture research could focus on intensive, longitudinal studies of engineering consultancies \nand thus track how the corporate brand is affected by shifts in the client-employee \nrelationship over time and space.  While our research has extended our understanding of B2B \nbranding by showing how external, macro-scale factors can play as significant a role as \ninternal factors in influencing how employees in these contexts perceive corporate branding, \nmore research can still be done on how intra-organizational constructions of corporate \nbranding affect external-facing relationships with stakeholders, including, but not limited, to \ndirect clients.   \nOne case study is clearly insufficient to draw generalizable conclusions about the perceptions \nof employees about the implications of B2B corporate branding. Furthermore, insights from \nextant literatures in organization studies, identity theories, and human resource management \nare particularly useful to be used to understand how professionals in B2B contexts can be \nmotivated to play an increasing role in corporate branding. The implications discussed in this \npaper equally speak to other disciplines such as engineering management, industrial \nengineering, organizational behaviour and human resource management. More cross-\ndisciplinary work is, therefore, required to explicate the complexities involved in the \ncorporate branding of engineering-intensive contexts.  \n33 \n \nReferences \nAlvesson, M.
