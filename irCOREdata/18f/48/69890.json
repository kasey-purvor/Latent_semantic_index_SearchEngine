Perhaps the best-known example\nis to be found in the Anglepoise lamp (Fig. 1), a series of\nelegant designs by the engineer George Carwardine,\nwhich appeared for the first time over 60 years ago in\n1933\u201335 and have since become classics.\nThis paper sets out a new account of the working\nprinciple of the counterbalancing system and how to\napply it, including Carwardine\u2019s ingenious extension of\nthe basic element to two degrees of freedom. As far as is\nknown, the first published treatment of this problem,\nother than Carwardine\u2019s patents, is that in the first\nedition (1971) of reference [1].\nEarlier, Hain [2] had studied similar problems but had\nonly devised techniques for a limited number of preci-\nsion points, or for an infinite number of precision points\nusing a snail of general form and a fusee. He appears to\nhave overlooked Carwardine\u2019s solution.\nNathan [3], evidently unaware of Carwardine\u2019s work,\nderived the solution and extended it to two degrees of\nfreedom. He proposed several methods of achieving a\nspring of e\u0080ectively zero free length (an essential\nrequirement for exact balance, as shown in Section 2),\ne.g. by combining a pair of tension and compression\nsprings, but he did not mention the possibility of using a\nclose-coiled spring.\nStreit and Gilmore [4] apparently read [1] but failed to\nnote that it included the solution (perhaps because\nreference [1] is a textbook in which this is set as a pro-\nblem exercise). In reference [4], and again in reference\n[5], an analysis was presented of a balancing mechanism\nwith any number of springs which need not lie in a\nThe MS was received on 3 December 1998 and was accepted after\nrevision for publication on 16 March 1999.\n*Corresponding author: Engineering Department, Faculty of Applied\nSciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YR, UK.\n501\nC09898 \u00df IMechE 2000 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 214 Part C\nvertical plane. The use of springs that do not lie in a\nvertical plane introduces undesirable side loads and\nrequires ball-joints instead of pins at the ends of springs;\nthus it is di\u0081cult to see why anyone would want to use\nthis method.\n2 ANALYSIS OF THE SINGLE-DEGREE-OF-\nFREEDOM MECHANISM\nFigure 2a is a schematic diagram of a simple spring-and-\nlever balancing mechanism. A mass m is at point Z on\nthe end of an arm CAZ, pivoted at A to a member AB.\nThe whole mechanism is in a vertical plane, and AB is\nheld in a vertical position. The aim is to support the\nweight of the mass m accurately over a wide range of\npositions \u0012. Two methods of solution of this problem are\npresented.\n2.1 Method 1\nIt would be possible to balance the arm by means of a\nconstant, vertically downward force at C equal to mgr=b\n(see Fig. 2a for the lengths a, b, c and r). The balancing\nspring CB needs to exert the same moment about A as\nthis vertical force, for all positions \u0012 of the arm.\nLet a force P in the direction AC be added to the\nspring force F such that the resultant of these two forces\nis vertical. Then, since P has no moment about A, this\nvertical resultant has the same moment about A as force\nF has; for exact balance the resultant must always be\nequal to mgr=b.\nNow, consider ABC as a triangle of forces used to\nobtain this resultant. The resultant, represented by AB,\nis vertical and will be constant if the force in the spring is\nproportional to CB, i.e. to the length of the spring. Thus\nthe free length of the spring, i.e. the length when there is\nno tension, must be zero (see Section 2.3).\nFinally, to make the resultant equal to mgr=b, the\nscale of the triangle of forces must be chosen so that the\nlength c represents the force mgr=b; then an extension c\nof the spring would give this force, and the sti\u0080ness k is\ngiven by\nk \u0088 mgr\nbc\n\u00851\u0086\n2.2 Method 2\nAn alternative solution is as follows:\nArea of triangle ABC\n\u0088 12 BC\u0002 \u0085perpendicular distance\nofA from lineBC\u0086 \u00852\u0086\nFig. 1 Anglepoise lamp of the original design\n502 M J FRENCH AND M B WIDDEN\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 214 Part C C09898 \u00df IMechE 2000\nTherefore the arm about A of the force F in the spring\nBC, in other words the perpendicular distance of A from\nthe line BC, is\n2\u0002 area of triangleABC\nBC\n\u00853\u0086\nHowever, the area of the triangle ABC is equal to\n1\n2 bc sin \u0012 \u00854\u0086\nThus the arm about A of the force F is\nbc sin \u0012\na\n\u00855\u0086\nThe required moment is mgr sin \u0012; therefore, for balance,\nFbc sin \u0012\na\n\u0088 mgr sin \u0012 \u00856\u0086\nor\nF \u0088 mgr\nbc\na \u00857\u0086\nas before. In other words, the tension F in the spring is\nproportional to its overall length a; the spring sti\u0080ness is\nk \u0088 mgr=bc. For the tension F to be brought to zero, a\nmust also go to zero, i.e. the spring has zero free length.\nShould the reader be in any doubt about this, put l0\nequal to the unstretched length of the spring. Then\nF \u0088 k\u0085a\u00ff l0\u0086 \u00858\u0086\nTherefore, for exact balance, substituting for F in\nequation (7),\nk\u0085a\u00ff l0\u0086bc \u0088 mgra \u00859\u0086\nor\na \u0088 kl0\nk\u00ff \u0085mgr=bc\u0086 \u008510\u0086\nThe length a clearly varies with \u0012, but all the quantities\nin the fraction on the right-hand side of equation (10)\nare constants. The only way that equation (10) can hold\nfor all \u0012 is if the right-hand side is indeterminate, i.e. if l0\nand k\u00ff \u0085mgr=bc\u0086 are both zero.\n2.3 Zero-free-length springs\nIt is well known that a pre-tension in a spring can be\ninduced by imposing a twist on the wire as the spring is\nwound [6, 7]. The coils of the spring then remain tightly\nclosed until the applied force reaches a certain value,\nFig. 2 Simple spring-and-lever balancing mechanism\nTHE SPRING-AND-LEVER BALANCING MECHANISM, GEORGE CARWARDINE AND THE ANGLEPOISE LAMP 503\nC09898 \u00df IMechE 2000 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 214 Part C\nand the e\u0080ective unstretched length is less than the initial\nclose-wound length. It is quite possible to reduce the\ne\u0080ective unstretched length to zero, or even to a negative\nvalue.\n2.4 Alternative arrangement with the spring above A\nIf desired, C may be placed on the same side of A as Z,\nbut then B must be above A (Fig. 2b). It can be shown\nby similar methods that, for perfect balance, the\nrequirements are the same, namely that the unstretched\nlength l0 of the spring must be zero, and the sti\u0080ness of\nthe spring must be given by k \u0088 mgr=bc.\n3 TWO-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM DESIGNS\n3.1 Configuration with springs on the arms\nA two-degree-of-freedom system may be made using a\nparallelogram (or equivalent) mechanism to carry the\nvertical reference from the inner to the outer joint. One\nsuch arrangement is shown in Fig. 3a, where the basic\nscheme is that of Fig. 2b, i.e. with C on the same side of\nA as the load in both cases. A1L1B1 and A2L2B2 are\ncongruent rigid links, and the parallelogrammatic four-\nbar chain L1L2A2A1 maintains A2B2 parallel to A1B1,\ni.e. vertical. The spring B2C2 for the outer system needs\nto be designed according to the requirements set out in\nSection 2 above.\nAs far as the inner system is concerned, the weight mg\nat Z can be replaced by a downward force mg at A2\ntogether with a clockwise couple mgr2 sin \u00122. The vertical\nforce mg at A2 is supported by the spring B1C1, which\nmust have zero free length and sti\u0080ness k1 calculated as\nset out in equation (1). The couple mgr2 sin \u00122 is carried\nentirely by tension and compression in the arms L1L2\nand A1A2 respectively, and imposes no load on the\nspring B1C1. This is evident since the line A2B2 remains\nvertical; therefore, the couple does no work as the angle\n\u00121 is varied. Hence, once the sti\u0080ness of the inner spring\nhas been calculated to bring the force mg at A2 to\nequilibrium, the linkage is balanced for all values of the\nangles \u00121 and \u00122.\n3.2 Configuration with all the springs at the base\nThe Anglepoise design has the more elegant two-degree-\nof-freedom system shown in Fig. 3b, with all the springs\nat the base and only one link AB. The four-bar chain\nHJED is parallelogrammatic and the lengths C2D and\nAE are equal, so that the points C2 and A, although not\ndirectly linked, lie on a line parallel to DE and HJZ. The\nlengths a1 and a2* and therefore the tensions in the two\nsprings then depend only on \u00121 and \u00122 respectively; thus\nthe two arms C1AEJ and HJZ are e\u0080ectively decoupled\nas far as their static equilibrium is concerned. This is\nborne out by the argument below.\nBy method 2 of Section 2.2, the arms of the two\nsprings about point A are respectively\nb1c1 sin \u00121\na1\nand\nb2c2 sin \u00122\na2\n\u008511\u0086\nBy moments about point A, for balance,\nF1\nb1c1 sin \u00121\na1\n\u0087 F2 b2c2 sin \u00122\na2\n\u0088 mg\u0085r1 sin \u00121 \u0087 r2 sin \u00122\u0086 \u008512\u0086\nwhere F1 and F2 are the tensions in springs 1 and 2\nrespectively. Equation (12) is to hold for all values of \u00121\nand \u00122, but this can only be so if the terms in the\nequation involving \u00121 always balance and the terms\ninvolving \u00122 also always balance. Therefore\nF1 \u0088 mgr1\nb1c1\na1; F2 \u0088 mgr2\nb2c2\na2 \u008513\u0086\n(There are other ways of approaching this which are\nequally good, e.g. using energy methods.)\nAs in Section 2.2, the tension in each spring is pro-\nportional to its overall length a, i.e. it must have zero\nunstretched length. The sti\u0080nesses of the two springs are\nk1 \u0088 mgr1\nb1c1\n; k2 \u0088 mgr2\nb2c2\n\u008514\u0086\n4 DISTRIBUTED MASS\nSo far the weights of the arms have been neglected. In\npractice these are often relatively small, but they may\nnot be insignificant.\nFor design of the single-degree-of-freedom mechan-\nism, referring again to Fig. 2a, the centre of mass, G, of\nthe arm and load combined should be used in place of\nthe end of the arm, Z. Points C, A and G should be in a\nstraight line, and r is now the distance AG. The sti\u0080ness\nof the spring, k, is equal to mgr=bc, and its free length is\nto be zero, as before.\nFigure 4 shows the two-degree-of-freedom mechanism\nwith the weights of the principal parts included. For\nexact balance the outer part of the mechanism must\nhave points H, J and G2 in a straight line, just as for the\nsingle-degree-of-freedom mechanism.\nIn the figure it has been assumed (as is likely) that the\ncentre of gravity, G1, of arm C1AEJ lies on the straight\nline through these four points. Similarly, G3 has been\nassumed to lie on the line C2DH.*a1; a2; b1; b2; c1 and c2 have similar meanings to a; b and c in Fig. 2a.\n504 M J FRENCH AND M B WIDDEN\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 214 Part C C09898 \u00df IMechE 2000\nFig. 3 Two-degree-of-freedom balancing mechanisms\nTHE SPRING-AND-LEVER BALANCING MECHANISM, GEORGE CARWARDINE AND THE ANGLEPOISE LAMP 505\nC09898 \u00df IMechE 2000 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 214 Part C\nMoments can be taken about the point A, as in Sec-\ntion 3.2.

The sti\u0080nesses of the two springs are given by the\nexpressions in square brackets.\nIf the centres of gravity of the arms C1AEJ and C2DH\nwere to lie o\u0080 the straight lines through the pivots, it can\nreadily be shown that a term in cos \u00121 would be intro-\nduced into equation (16); then the equation would be\nexactly satisfied only for a single position \u00121.\nFig. 4 Two-degree-of-freedom mechanism with weights of the arms included\n506 M J FRENCH AND M B WIDDEN\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 214 Part C C09898 \u00df IMechE 2000\nIn most later copies of the Anglepoise lamp, it seems\nthat precision has been sacrificed to cheapness of man-\nufacture, since the position of the centroid G2 varies as\nthe lamp is rotated.

The second youngest of 12\nsurviving children, he attended Bath Bluecoat School on\na scholarship but left when aged 14 (R. Raven, 1995,\npersonal communication).\nFrom 1901 to 1905 Carwardine served his appren-\nticeship at the Whiting Auto Works in Bath. Following\nthis he was employed in a succession of the town\u2019s\nengineering workshops, all the while gaining formal\nqualifications through study at home. As a young man,\nhe also studied for the Ministry with the intention of\njoining his elder brother Charles as a missionary in\nChina, but a bout of illness left him unfit to follow this\nvocation.\nIn 1912 he joined the Horstmann Car Company in\nBath as chargehand, rising by 1916 to the position of\nboth Works Manager and Chief Designer. Second only\nto the entrepreneurial inventor Sidney Horstmann,\nCarwardine was largely responsible for the design of all\ncars manufactured there, travelling on occasion to the\nBrooklands racetrack for trials.\nIn about 1924 he set up his own business, Cardine\nAccessories, in Locksbrook Road, Bath. Here he\ndesigned and manufactured various items and compo-\nnents, most notably automobile suspension systems. It\nhas been alleged (but never proved) that his successful\ndesign for independent front suspension was pirated by\nGeneral Motors. The late 1920s saw Cardine Acces-\nsories cease operations, no doubt a victim of the\nDepression, and Carwardine\u2019s brief return to Horst-\nmann. In 1931 he became a freelance consulting engineer\nand inventor.\nHe had already displayed interest in developing ver-\nsatile counterbalancing devices, intended to support a\nweight in any position in three dimensions. The stream\nof patents registered in his name between 1931 and 1934\ndemonstrates clearly how his ideas developed.\nThe first patent in this series [8] that relates directly to\nthe spring-and-lever balancing mechanism describes, as\none possible embodiment, a special form of the\nmechanism in which (referring to the letters used in Fig.\n2) the lengths AB and AC are equal. As we have seen in\nSection 2, this is an unnecessary requirement. The zero-\nfree-length spring was to be achieved by arranging a\npivoted slide so that (a) the centre-line of the spring\nalways passed through the pivot point and (b) the free\nend of the spring when relaxed was opposite the pivot.\nCarwardine does not seem to have been aware when he\nfiled the patent that AB and AC do not need to be equal,\nnor that a spring could be wound so that it had a tension\nin it in the close-coiled condition.\nThe next patent [6], filed on 4 July 1932, has the\nessential features of the Anglepoise mechanism: two\nTHE SPRING-AND-LEVER BALANCING MECHANISM, GEORGE CARWARDINE AND THE ANGLEPOISE LAMP 507\nC09898 \u00df IMechE 2000 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 214 Part C\ncranks, not necessarily of equal length, connected by a\nspring of zero free length. The patent briefly describes\nthe means of producing such springs. A two-degree-of-\nfreedom linkage to support an electric lamp is shown,\nwith the springs on the arms as in Fig. 3a.\nUK Patent 417 970 [9], filed in October 1933, relates\nto a means of supporting table mirrors, pictures and the\nlike so that they can be tilted at any desired angle and\nstill remain in equilibrium. The invention includes the\nclose-wound spring whose tension is proportional to its\noverall length and is similar in essence to the arrange-\nment shown in Fig. 2b. A di\u0081culty in this case is the\nabsence of a fixed vertical reference, which Carwardine\novercomes by adding a third member pivoted to the\nback of the mirror and sliding on a pin in the supporting\nstrut so that, although not fixed, it remains vertical.\nThe Anglepoise configuration as shown in Fig. 1, with\nall the springs at the base, was introduced in UK Patent\n433 617 [10]. The drawings that illustrate the patent are\nclearly of the final design of the lamp. The essential\nfeatures of the equipoising mechanism, namely the\nclose-wound springs of zero free length and the paral-\nlelogram linkage, are clearly described, and Carwardine\nnoted that the lamp itself is mounted in a fork so that\nthe axis passes through the centre of gravity of the lamp\nand the balance is maintained as the lamp is rotated. He\nalso notes that friction cannot be entirely eliminated\nfrom the mechanism, so that the links may remain in\nposition even in presence of small errors such as devia-\ntions from linearity in the springs.\nCarwardine\u2019s designs have been and continue to be\ncopied in many products throughout the world.\n508 M J FRENCH AND M B WIDDEN\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 214 Part C C09898 \u00df IMechE 2000\n"}
