It has been proposed5 that the electron affinity of\ndiamond is largely determined by its local bonding environ-\nment. By analogy, amorphous carbon with a similar local\nbonding configuration to that of the diamond surface should\nalso have a relatively low electron affinity. Photoelectron\nyield measurements on a-C:H ~Ref. 6! do suggest wide band-\ngap ~.3.5 eV! polymeric a-C:H has a low electron affinity.\nField emission has been measured on several carbon\ncontaining materials.

Nitrogen containing single-crystal dia-\nmonds coated with O and Cs will emit at fields ,1 V mm.4\nFor smooth homogeneous films high fields are usually nec-\nessary ;10\u201320 V mm21.10 In this letter we report on an\neasily manufactured, smooth carbon and nitrogen containing\nfilm which can emit electrons at fields of 4 V mm21.

The doping mechanism in a-C:H:N is somewhat com-\nplicated in that the donor level is not determined by a clear-\ncut substitutional or interstitial bonding environment as in\ndiamond. Rather in a-C:H:N the actual network changes to\naccommodate the N.

Experimental studies on the electrical\nproperties of a-C:H:N carried out by us confirm that the\nvariation in activation energy with increasing N is consistent\nwith it acting as a donor12 but an inefficient one.\na-C:H and a-C:H:N films were deposited from a\nCH4 \/He\/N2 gas mixture using a capacitively coupled rf\nPECVD apparatus with magnetic confinement. Magnetic\nconfinement enables the formation of a dense plasma which\nis suitable for ionization of N2 and N. Highly doped n-Si\n~0.01\u20130.001 V cm! was used as the substrate material and\nthe back contact to the films. All depositions were carried out\nwith the substrate holder held at a temperature of 20 \u00b0C.\nDetails of deposition process can be found in the literature.14\nThe structure, composition, and bulk electronic properties of\nthe films were examined using a number of methods. Elec-\ntron energy loss spectroscopy ~EELS! was used to determine\nfilm density. Film structure was determined by examination\nof the fine structure in the C and N k-edge features obtained\nfrom EELS. The relative N content in the films was obtained\nfrom EELS, nuclear reaction analysis ~NRA! and XPS: all\nthree techniques giving similar values for N content. The H\ncontent was determined by electron recoil data analysis\n~ERDA! and RBS. Additionally, I\u2013V\u2013T measurements ~on\nfilms deposited under identical conditions on metal and\nquartz substrates! were also carried out to determine the in-\nfluence of increasing the N content on resistivity. The results\ntaken together suggest that, as in the case of unhydrogenated\namorphous carbon,11 N acts as an electron donor in a-C:H:N,\nthough an inefficient one as activation at room temperature is\nmainly to the conduction band tail states.12\nField emission measurements were carried out using\nsmooth mirror quality a-C:H:N films n11-Si substrates as\nthe cathode, and an ITO coated glass slide as the anode.

The\ncurrent density is calculated by taking the entire film area to\nform the cathode ~all values of current density are quoted in\nthis basis!. The electric field is that obtained by taking the\nentire applied voltage to be dropped across the vacuum gap.\nControl experiments were carried out using an uncoated Si\nsubstrate and by reversing the polarity of the anode\u2013cathode\nterminals. No current could be measured up to a field of 50\nV mm 21 ~the instrumentation was sensitive down to a cur-\nrent level of 10 nA!. The nominal onset fields for an emis-\nsion current density of 1023 mA cm22 from the data in Fig.\n1~a! are: 28 V m m21 ~0% N!, 16 V mm21 ~7%!, 13 V\nmm 21 ~11% N!, 6 V mm 21 ~14% N!, and 4 V mm 21 ~15%\nN!.

There is some justification in\nassuming an ideal flat plate emitter, AFM profiles before and\nafter emission measurements on 0%, 7%, and 11% N films\nshow an unchanged minimum to maximum surface morphol-\nogy ,3 nm. However, extrapolation of the data using the\ncalculated emission barrier gives an effective emission area\nof the order of 10228\u2013 10229 m2 ~whereas the entire cathode\narea is 1024 m2!. Furthermore, optical absorption measure-\nments of the band gap of the a-C:H:N films gave values in\nthe range of 1.7\u20132.1 eV, which, when taken together with\nphotoelectron yield measurements,6 would give the films an\nelectron affinity of >2 eV. The origin of the very low 0.05\u2013\n0.03 eV emission barrier, therefore, cannot be directly re-\nlated to any fundamental property of the a-C:H:N ~as in the\ncase of classical F\u2013N emission from metal cathodes!.\nThe ITO coated glass anode can also be used as a low\npersistence phosphor for imaging of the emission from the\nunderlying cathode at high current density.15 At a current\ndensity below 1022 mA cm22 there is no glow from the ITO\nwhich is perceptible to the naked eye. As the current density\napproaches 531022 mA cm22 there appears a uniform\npurple glow over the entire anode area which overlies the\ncathode. This uniform glow is weak and can only be seen in\nthe dark. It appears, therefore, that at this level of current\ndensity there is uniform emission from the a-C:H:N film on\nn11-Si. When the current density rises above 831022 mA\ncm22, bright spots begin to appear and the highest current\nemission occurs, preferentially, from a limited number of\nspots. Further increase of the electric field and current leads\nto the spots becoming brighter and a number of spots be-\ncome unstable. The glow has a background of randomly\nmoving spots due to emission sites turning on and off, to-\ngether with emission spots which are stable over time peri-\nods of minutes. A typical image of bright emission spots, at\na nominal current density of 0.1 mA cm22 ~calculated over\nthe entire cathode!, is shown in Fig. 2~a!. The emission from\nthe same sample at a current density of 0.2 mA cm22 is\nshown in Fig. 2~b!. The three optical fiber spacers can be\nseen in Fig. 2~b! due to the enhanced emission caused by the\nfield concentration around them. The nonuniformity in the\ngap introduced by the three fiber spacers is clearly seen from\nthe much brighter glow between the top two fibers.

These pictures were taken in a normally lighted room.\nTo understand the origins of the emission process from\na-C:H:N on n-Si, we have considered a composite n11-Si\na-C:H:N\/vacuum\/metal energy band diagram ~Fig. 3!. The Si\nand the a-C:H:N should be viewed as forming a\nheterojunction.16 The a-C:H:N is taken to be the most\n~15%N! n-type with an electron affinity of 2 eV and a thick-\nness of 0.3 mm. It is assumed that there are no charged defect\nstates at the heterojunction interface. The electron affinity of\nthe Si and the anode metal are taken to be 4 and 3.7 eV,\nrespectively ~Fig. 3 is drawn to scale with a vacuum gap of\n1.5 mm!. The depletion region of 150 nm at an anode voltage\nof 0 V in the a-C:H:N is calculated using a dielectric con-\nstant of 4, activation energy of 0.5 V ~from measured refrac-\ntive index and J2T on the 15% N film! and assuming an\nionized donor density of 331016 cm23 @Fig. 3~a!#. The do-\nnor density was assumed on the basis of the measured acti-\nvation energy. The band diagram which arises if 10 V are\napplied between the n11-Si and the metal anode ~to give\nwhat would be viewed experimentally as a field of\n;7 V mm21 across the 1.5 mm vacuum gap! is shown in Fig.\n3~b!. What is interesting to note is that with a charge density\nof 331016 C cm23 in the a-C:H:N there is a larger electric\nfield across the 0.3 mm thick film ~> 20 V mm 21! than what\nwould have been expected across the vacuum gap in the case\nof a metal-vacuum-metal field emission configuration. With\nalmost 6 V dropped across the a-C:H:N film, carriers which\nenter the a-C:H:N film at its conduction band edge by ther-\nmal excitation ~or tunneling through interface states! from\nthe Si and drift in the direction of the electric field, can lose\nup to 4 eV in collisions and still remain close to the vacuum\nlevel at the a-C:H:N surface. The model suggests that hot\nFIG. 3. Heterojunction band diagram of n11-Si\/a-C:H:N ~0.3 mm! vacuum\n~1.5 mm!\/metal structure.

With a semiconductor, the major difference is\nthe distributed nature of the space charge and the ability to\ncontrol the amount of band bending by varying the donor\nconcentration.\nThe enhanced emission from a-C:H:N as the N content\nincreases, can now be understood in terms of an increase in\nthe concentration of ionized donor centers leading to a higher\nfield across the films at a given applied voltage between the\nn11-Si and the metal anode. @Figure 3~b! illustrates the ex-\nperimental case with maximum concentration.# A conse-\nquence of this model is that the true cathode is the n11-Si\nand that the a-C:H:N acts as, what we term, a \u2018\u2018space charge\ninterlayer\u2019\u2019 with a lower electron affinity to enhance electron\nemission.\nOur results imply that although a-C:H:N films are suc-\ncessful in bringing about very low onset fields ~4 V mm21!\nfor field emission, the 1 mA cm22 current density required\nfor diode-type field emission displays cannot be obtained\nuniformly and reliably. Additionally, the highest current den-\nsity at the lowest field ~a-C:H:N with 15% N! has been ob-\ntained from a film which shows a V2 current dependence.\nThis is not appropriate for the switching of a display ele-\nment, where an exponential increase in current is required to\nobtain sharp turn-on at a well-defined voltage.18 However, in\na triode configuration, where the cathode can operate at\nlower current densities, a-C:H:N has a great potential as a\nthin-film cathode interlayer for reduction of the emission\nfield.\n1 I.
