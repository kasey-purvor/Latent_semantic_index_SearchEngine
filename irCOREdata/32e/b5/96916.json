INTRODUCTION \nIn vivo cancer growth is a complicated phenomenon involving many \ninterrelated processes. Solid tumor growth is known to take place in two \ndistinct phases-the avascular phase and the vascular phase. The transi- \ntion from avascular growth to vascular growth depends upon the crucial \nprocess of neovascularization, and in order to accomplish this the tumor \ncells secrete a diffusible substance known as tumor anglogenesis factor \ninto the surrounding tissues. This has the effect of stimulating nearby \ncapillary blood vessels to grow toward and penetrate the tumor, resup- \nplying it with vital nutrient [121. Invasion and metastasis can now take \nplace. By the time a tumor has grown to a size whereby it can be \ndetected by clinical means, there is a strong likelihood that it has \nalready reached the vascular growth phase. In this paper we focus on \nthe initial avascular stage of tumor growth and present a mathematical \nmodel for one of the processes involved. \nThe initial avascular growth phase can be studied in the laboratory \nby culturing cancer cells in the form of three-dimensional multicell \nspheroids. It is well known that these spheroids, whether grown from \nMATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES 121:1-13 (1994) \nOElsevier Science Inc., 1994 \n1 \n655 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10010 0025-5564\/94\/$7.00 \n2 M. A. J. CHAPLAIN ET AL. \nestablished tumor cell lines or actual in vivo tumor specimens, possess \ngrowth kinetics that are very similar to those of in vivo tumors. Typi- \ncally, these avascular nodules grow to a few millimeters in diameter. \nCells toward the center, being deprived of vital nutrients, die and give \nrise to a necrotic core. Proliferating cells can be found in the outer \nthree to five cell layers. Lying between these two regions is a layer of \nquiescent cells, a proportion of which can be recruited into the outer \nlayer of proliferating cells. Many experimental data have been gathered \non the internal architecture of spheroids, and studies regarding the \ndistribution of vital nutrients (e.g., oxygen) within the spheroids have \nbeen carried out 18, 13-15, 18-23, 26, 40, 41, 44, 4.51. \nTo incorporate all of the known and observed experimental results \ninto a mathematical model would be a very formidable task indeed. \nFurthermore, from such a complicated model it would be difficult to \nfocus on the roles of individual processes. Even deciding upon simplify- \ning assumptions can be difficult. However, at minimum a realistic model \nof spheroid growth should include certain nonuniformities in the central \nprocesses of inhibition of mitosis, consumption of nutrients, and cell \nproliferation as well as the dependence of cell mitotic rate on growth \ninhibitor concentration, geometrical constraints, and central necrosis. \nSeveral papers [2-6, 11, 33, 39, 431 have focused attention on the \nchemical inhibition of mitosis within multicell spheroids, the main \nassumption of the modeling being that a growth inhibitory factor (GIF) \nis produced within the spheroid in some prescribed spatially dependent \nmanner to reflect the observed cellular heterogeneity within spheroids. \nThe existence and properties of chemicals that inhibit mitosis are \nvery will documented [7, 17, 28, 30-32, 381. Indeed there is experimental \nevidence concerning the specific effects of extracts from necrotic areas \nin tumors. It has been demonstrated that these extracts possess the \nability to reduce the proliferation of cultured cells [34] and also of \nmonolayer tumor cells [18, 211, and the same effects have been pro- \nposed to occur in tumors in vivo [27]. In this paper we focus attention \non the diffusion of a growth inhibitory factor within a multicell spheroid \nand its possible effect on cell mitosis and proliferation. To this end, \ninstead of a nonlinear production term, we consider the effects of \nintroducing a nonlinear, spatially dependent diffusion coefficient. \nIt is known that in spheroids normal structural associations (e.g., \ncell-cell junctions) are disrupted, and hence the possibility arises of \nnormal intercellular signals being disrupted also. Nonlinear diffusion of \nthe GIF within the spheroid is one possible and simple way to take \naccount of this. In Section 2 we present a mathematical model for this \nand compare our results with previous models and also with the avail- \nable experimental data. These results are discussed in the final section \nas are the merits and demerits of both types of models. \nGIF NONLINEAR DIFFUSION IN MULTICELL SPHEROIDS 3 \n2. THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL \nThe control of mitosis in tissues can be modeled as a schematic \nmechanism in which self-regulating growth is achieved as a result of \nnegative feedback from the growing tissue [391. In this approach mitosis \nis assumed to be controlled by a discontinuous switchlike mechanism, \nsuch that if the concentration of the GIF is less than some threshold \nlevel 0, say, in any region within the tissue, mitosis occurs in this region, \nwhereas if the concentration is greater than 0, mitosis is completely \ninhibited. The differential equation describing the diffusion, production, \nand degradation of the GIF within a spheroid can be written \n%=DvzC+f(C)+hS(r), rER, (2.1) \nwhere C = C(r,t) is the concentration of GIF within the spheroid \noccupying the region KI E s3 and A is the inhibitor production rate \n(molecules per unit volume per second). A more detailed description of \nthe background biology and the derivation of the above equation can be \nfound in [2, 3, 18, 21, 31, 391. Previous papers make the assumptions \nthat the GIF is produced throughout the tissue by the individual cells, \nmodeled by a source function S(r), diffuses with a constant diffusion \ncoefficient D, and is depleted everywhere at a prescribed rate f(C). \nShymko and Glass [391 and Adam 12-41 use the function f(C) = - yC, \nwhere y is the decay or loss constant. Various forms for the source \nfunction S(r) have been used. In the original model of Shymko and \nGlass [39], the GIF is assumed to be produced at a constant rate \nthroughout the tissue, yielding the uniform source function \nr inside the tissue, \nr outside the tissue. \nIn an attempt to model more accurately the heterogeneity of cells \nwithin tumors, the models of Adam consider a norzunifonn source \nfunction of the form \nOsrsR, \nr> R, \nwhere r is the distance from the origin. However, as shown by Britton \nand Chaplain [6], the nonuniform source term of Adam [2-51 is unreal- \nistic from a biological point of view since S\u2019(O) # 0, and they suggest a \nsmooth source function of the form \nI-r2\/R2, OsrsR \nr> R. \n(2.2) \n4 M. A. J. CHAPLAIN ET AL. \nIf system (2.2) is studied in a spherical geometry with radial symme- \ntry, that is, a sphere of radius R, where the GIF concentration depends \nonly on the radial distance from the center of the sphere [C = C(r)], \nthen it may be used to model mitotic inhibition within multicell \nspheroids. As stated in the introduction, there is a large body of \nexperimental data available for multicell spheroids that can be used to \nstudy tumor microregions, the results of which can be applied to in vivo \ntumors [40, 421. Small spheroidal nodules of tumor cells can be grown in \nthe laboratory, the growth kinetics of which closely follow the first \navascular stage of in vivo tumor growth such as carcinomas. These grow \nto a diffusion-limited steady-state size a few millimeters in diameter. \nCells at the center of the avascular nodule are starved of vital nutrients \nand die [26], forming a central necrotic core. A thin layer of live, \nproliferating cells three to five cell layers thick forms at the periphery of \nthe nodule, while sandwiched between these two regions is a layer of \nquiescent cells. A proportion of the quiescent cells are reproductively \nviable and may be recruited into the proliferating compartment. \nOne feature of spheroid growth that has hitherto not been treated in \ndetail by mathematical models is the importance of cell-cell contacts. It \nis known that spheroids are held together by various surface membrane \nmicroprojections, extracellular matrix, and a variety of cell-cell junc- \ntions including spot desmosomes, tight junctions, junctional complexes, \nand gap junctions. It is possible that the loss of coupling between cells \nmay play a critical role in the uncontrolled proliferation in cancer [351. \nIn addition to this, whether through gap junctions or by other struc- \ntures, intercellular permeability may not be constant between cells at \ndifferent stages of spheroid growth [l, 13, 291. These observatiosn \nsuggest that diffusion of chemicals between cells may not be constant \n(cf. [20]). In this paper, therefore, we examine the effect of spatial \nnonuniformity not on the production term but on the diffusion coeffi- \ncient, and to this end the model we consider is \n~=V.[D(r)VC] +f(C)+ AS(r), rER, (2.3) \ndC -= \ndr 0, \nr = 0, (2.4) \nD(r)$+PC=O on dlR, P>O, (2.5) \nwhere we assume that production of GIF is via the uniform source \nfunction; P is the permeability of the tissue surface, and the diffusion- \ncoefficient D(r) in (2.3) is now assumed to be spatially dependent, that \nis, it varies throughout the interior of the spheroid, for which there is \nexperimental evidence [201. Thus the observed cellular heterogeneity \nwithin spheroids, the heterogeneous intercellular permeability and the \nGIF NONLINEAR DIFFUSION IN MULTICELL SPHEROIDS 5 \ncomposition of the extracellular matrix, is accounted for via nonlinear \ndiffusion. The boundary conditions (2.4), (2.5) have been dealt with at \nlength elsewhere [2, 6, 391, and we do not discuss their derivation here. \nConsidering the spherical geometry described in the introduction and \nassuming radial symmetry, the above system reduces to \nac 1 d, _=-_ \nat r2 dr r2D(rpg -yC+ A, rsR, (2.6) \naC 0 dr= > r = 0, \nD(r)%+PC=O, r = R. \n(2.7) \n(2.8) \nTo facilitate analysis of the above system it is convenient to nondi- \nmensionalize, and hence we choose appropriate reference variables. \nThe obvious variables to choose (cf. [ll]) are, as the reference length, \nR, the radius of the spheroid under consideration; as a reference GIF \nconcentration, 0, the critical threshold level of C; and as a reference \ntime, R2\/D. Thus we define new variables \nWe also assume that we can write \nD(r) = Dd(r), (2.9) \nwhere D is a constant. The system now becomes, upon dropping the \ntildes for notational convenience, \ndC 1 d -=_- \ndt r2 dr ( \nr\u2019d(r)$j -L2C+aL2, \n1 \ndC -= \ndr 0, r = 0, \nd(r)$j+$C=O, , r=l \n(2.10) \n(2.11) \n(2.12) \nwhere ~~ = y\/D, L = KR, a = A\/y0 and n =(YD>\u201c~\/P. With this \nnondimensionalization we see that once the parameters for a particular \nspheroid are determined, the only undetermined parameter is the \nradius R. The solutions to (2.10) can therefore be monitored for \nspheroids of various sizes. Thus we can analyze the system using \ndifferent values for the spheroid radius R while holding constant the \nvarious observable parameters associated with the system, that is, D, y, \nP, and h\/8 (cf. [391X It is our intention to discover if a concentration \n6 M. A. J. CHAPLAIN ET AL. \nprofile of GIF inside the spheroid can be found corresponding to the \nobserved pattern of necrosis seen experimentally. \nSince it is known that rapidly growing tumors enlarge at a rate on the \norder of 0.4-0.7 mm\/day [9] while diffusing chemical substances, with \ndiffusion coefficients on the order of 10ph cm*\/s, and reach steady state \non a time scale of the order of a few minutes, then it is sufficient to \nconsider the corresponding steady-state equation given by \n(2.13) \ntogether with the boundary conditions (2.11), (2.12). To accomplish this, \n(2.10) was solved using the NAG routine D03PBF, with zero initial \nconditions C(r,O) = 0. The steady-state solutions evolved on a time \nscale of O(1). Various forms for the function d(r) were considered, \nwhich we assume is some monotonic function of r. Both monotonically \nincreasing functions of d(r) [d(O) < d(l)] and monotonically decreasing \nfunctions [d(O) > d(l)] were investigated. For our purposes we chose \nd(r) = 0.8 + 0.2r2 as an example of the former and d(r) = 1.0 - 0.2r2 as \nan example of the latter (variability in diffusion constants between \nspheroids grown from different cell lines has been verified experimen- \ntally [201). \nAs stated above, once the observable parameters have been fixed, the \nconcentration profile for different sized spheroids can be easily ob- \ntained from the steady-state solutions of (2.10) simply by varying one \nparameter, namely the spheroid radius R. Mathematical models for this \nstage of spheroid growth involving the dynamic evolution of the radius \nR(t) are given by, for example, Burton [lo], Greenspan [24-261, \nMcElwain and Ponzo [36], and Maggelakis and Adam [37]. In these \nmodels, since the initial growth of the spheroids is avascular, they grow \nto a finite, diffusion-limited size a few millimeters in diameter. Mathe- \nmatically, as t + m, R(t) + R*. Thus by varying (i.e., increasing) the \nvalue for R in (2.10) from an initial value R(O), say, up to R*, we can \neffectively follow the development of the GIF concentration profile \nwithin the spheroid as the spheroid grows. This seems intuitively more \nappropriate than letting R +m, which does not happen in practice. We \nalso note that a consequence of the nondimensionalization is that in \neach case the critical threshold level for mitosis occurs at C = 1. \n3. RESULTS \nThe results presented in this section are compared with the experi- \nmental data of Folkman and Hochberg [16]. In order to compare and \ncontrast our results with previous mathematical models, following \nGIF NONLINEAR DIFFUSION IN MULTICELL SPHEROIDS 7 \nShymko and Glass [39] and Chaplain and Britton [ll], we choose \nD = 5 X 10m7 cm\u2019\/s, P = 10m4 cm\/s, and y = 5 X 10P5\/s-\u2018. Corre- \nspondingly, K = 10 cm- \u2019 and n = 0.05. We note that in accordance with \nour assumption of a spatially varying diffusion coefficient [cf. (2.9)] the \nvalue of D given above will hold only at r = 1, that is, the tumor edge. \nThe value of the diffusion coefficient in the interior of the spheroid will \nvary according to the prescribed function d(r). To find a value for the \nparameter u, we follow the procedure of Chaplain and Britton [ll] and \nuse the experimental observation of Folkman and Hochberg [16] that \nwhen the spheroids are approximately 0.05 cm in radius, the volume of \nthe active mitotic zone is 0.6 of the total volume of the tissue. A simple \ncalculation then shows that the size of the inner radius of the necrotic \ncore must be 0.037cm (cf. [ll]). In terms of the nondimensionalized \nvariables, we therefore require that C = 1 when r = 0.74, L = 0.5, 71 = \n0.05. Equation (2.10) was solved numerically with various values of the \nparameter a and allowed to evolve to steady state. Figure 1 shows the \nsteady-state profiles achieved with a value of a = 32.5, that is, h\/8 = \n1.625 X lop3 s-r for (i) a monotonically increasing and (ii) a monotoni- \ncally decreasing diffusion coefficient.

Exact agreement could not be easily obtained since the analytic \nsolution of (2.10) is not known. \nFigure 2 shows the steady-state GIF profiles within a spheroid 4 mm \nin diameter, that is, the diffusion-limited size. Once again the two \ncurves correspond to (i) a monotonically increasing and (ii) a monotoni- \ncally decreasing diffusion coefficient. \nThe horizontal line drawn at C = 1 in all figures is the threshold \nvalue for the GIF. Hence in any region of the spheroid where the GIF \nconcentration is greater than 1, mitosis will be inhibited here. This \nenables regions within the spheroid where mitosis is taking place and \nthose where mitosis is inhibited (necrotic core) to be easily distin- \nguished. As can be clearly seen from Figure 2, the final steady-state \nGIF profile achieved is in good agreement with the experimental data \nof Folkman and Hochberg [16], where at the stable, diffusion-limited \nsize there was a narrow layer of one or two cells that was mitotically \nactive surrounding the necrotic core. These results also parallel those of \nChaplain and Britton [ill. \n0\u2019 I \n-1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.X I \nDistance from centre \nFK. 2.

Again these show good agreement with \nthe experimental observations. \nWe note for completeness that results similar to those of Britton and \nChaplain [6] can be obtained upon straightforward application of the \nmaximum principle to (2.10)-(2.12) and (3.2). Using these techniques it \nis easily shown that, qualitatively, the final GIF concentration profile \ndepends only on the qualitative form of the function d(r), which can be \nchosen to model the interior heterogeneity of the spheroids. \n4. CONCLUSIONS \nWe have shown that using a nonlinear, spatially dependent diffusion \ncoefficient, which reflects the cellular heterogeneity of the interior of \nmulticell spheroids and the heterogeneous intercellular permeability, is \nalone sufficient to produce a GIF concentration profile within the \nspheroid that is not incompatible with available experimetnal evidence. \nWe have also shown that a combination of nonlinear diffusion with a \nnonlinear source term can also account for the experimental observa- \ntions. Hence we have shown that a nonuniform source function is not \nGIF NONLINEAR DIFFUSION IN MULTICELL SPHEROIDS 11 \nthe only way to produce qualitatively correct GIF concentration profiles \nwithin multicell spheroids. Therefore, mathematically it is not possible \nto distinguish between the effects of nonlinear diffusion and a nonlinear \nsource term. We conclude that more experimental work on the precise \nmechanisms governing cell cycle kinetics (cf. [14, 15, 19, 451) must be \ndone to elucidate the underlying tissue heterogeneity. \nREFERENCES \n1 G. Adam, U. Steiner, H. Maier, and S.
