Furthermore, this represents an important \nlarge animal model for testing artificial liver support systems.\n 3\nBackground   \nAcute liver failure (ALF) is a dramatic clinical syndrome that results from massive \nhepatic necrosis. The mortality of ALF remains high despite progress in the fields of \nintensive care management and liver transplantation (1). ALF refers to the rapid \ndevelopment of severe acute liver injury with impaired synthetic function and \nencephalopathy in subjects with previously normal, or well-compensated liver disease \n(2). Generation of a suitable animal model would allow for a greater understanding of \nthe underlying pathophysiology of this condition and stimulate the development and \nrefinement of treatments for ALF. There is a need for a suitable large animal model of \nhepatic injury to facilitate the development of bio-artificial liver support systems in \nhumans and to assist pre-clinical assessment (3). \n \nSince the recognition of acetaminophen\u2013induced ALF in the 1960s, acetaminophen \noverdose has become the commonest cause of liver failure in the United Kingdom (4). \nAlthough an effective antidote (N-acetylcysteine) has been available for many years, \nthe late presentation of many cases ensures a significant number develop liver failure.  \nEarly large animal models of acetaminophen toxicity were unreliable, producing \ninconsistent toxicity from animal to animal. Gazzard et al (5) showed that dogs \nreceiving oral doses greater than 1 g\/kg died of nonhepatic causes, becoming cyanotic \nimmediately before death with methylene blue-resistant methaemoglobinaemia.   \nHuman studies have shown that serum acetaminophen levels must be >140 mg\/mL \nfor greater than 20 hours for consistent hepatic necrosis to occur (6). Using this, \nFrancavilla et al (7) studied various doses and dosing schedules on 52 beagle dogs.  \nThese initially received 750 mg\/kg acetaminophen subcutaneously followed by 200 \nmg\/kg nine hours later, and then a further 200 mg\/kg twenty-four hours later. \nMortality rates in this group were: 0% at 24 hours, 10% at 48 hours, and 90% at 72 \nhours. Serum transaminase levels were greatly increased to 8206 +\/- 3000 U\/L at 48 \nhours and 21 253 +\/- 3746 U\/L at 72 hours. This correlated with liver biopsy samples \nthat revealed severe centrilobular necrosis.  \nSeveral approaches have been adopted to control methaemoglobinaemia in animal \nmodels: Kelly et al (8) using dogs, suspected high plasma acetaminophen levels were \nresponsible for the lethal methaemoglobinaemia that characterised their early \nexperiments. They controlled acetaminophen infusion in an attempt to maintain its \nlevels at 175 to 200 mg\/mL for the first 20 hours. Methylene blue was administered at \n10mg\/kg if blood samples appeared brown on visual inspection. Pilot data showed \nthat levels of acetaminophen greater than 300 mg\/mL were associated with severe \nmethemoglobinemia.  \n \nCellular glutathione (GSH) levels must be depleted to approximately 20% of their \noriginal levels before toxic acetaminophen damage can occur, (9, 10). To reduce \nvariation in the acetaminophen dose required and the time taken for the development \nof signs, Kelly et al (8) attempted to deplete GSH levels by administering 2 mmol\/kg \nof buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) 2 hours before acetaminophen. BSO (11), an \nanalogue for glutathione synthetase, binds and irreversibly inactivates this enzyme \nwhich is the final enzyme in GSH synthesis. The rapid turnover of cellular GSH, \nensures that enzyme inactivation leads to a rapid reduction in the hepatocyte GSH \nconcentrations. Kelly et al (8) showed that BSO administration to mice decreased \nhepatic GSH stores to 15% to 20% of normal within 2 hours. They showed greater \nliver damage in the BSO group in terms of alanine aminotransferase activity, \nprothrombin time, bilirubin level, and histological characteristics. Miller et al (12) \n 4\nadministered phenobarbital to induce cytochrome P-450 enzymes and thus potentiate \nsubsequent acetaminophen toxicity. This increased liver damage and decreased \nanimal survival.  \n \nThere has been limited success in the development of suitable large animal models of \nacetaminophen induced liver injury. In the study described here we used bed-side \nbiochemical and invasive haemodynamic monitoring during acetaminophen-induced \nliver damage in a reproducible and controlled manner.  Using this approach we \nmarkedly reduced previously reported problems, i.e., methaemoglobinaemia and \ncardiovascular collapse, and produced a large animal model which reliably reproduces \nthe syndrome of ALF observed in clinical practice. \n \n \n \n 5\nMethods \nAnimal experiments were performed in accordance with the Home Office regulations \nunder the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 as per Project licence 60\/2389. \nAll animals received humane care and study protocols complied with our institution's \nguidelines. \n \n13 Large White pigs (median body mass 35 kg) were maintained under. Anaesthesia \nwas induced with Ketamine and Midazolam, and subsequently maintained with \nisoflurane and nitrous oxide according to tidal volume. Background hydration was \nmaintained at a rate of 2mls\/kg\/hr using a combination of 0.9% Normal Saline and \n5% Dextrose according to electrolyte results from arterial blood gas sampling and \nurine output. Boluses of colloid (Gelofusine) were administered for episodes of \nhypotension. Heater pads were used to ensure that core (rectal) temperature was \nmaintained between 37-39\u00baC (the normal temperature range for pigs) (13). \nHaemodynamic variables were monitored continuously using a Datex AS\/3 \nmonitoring system (Datex Ohmeda, Stirling, UK) and recorded at one minute \nintervals using the Datex Collect programme on a laptop computer.   Measurements \nwere made from arterial, central venous and pulmonary arterial cannulae. The latter \nallowed hourly left atrial pressure (from pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) and \ncardiac output (thermodilution) measurements: 10 mls isotonic saline aliquots at 4\u00b0C \nwere injected through the injectate port of the pulmonary artery catheter using a \nclosed injectate system (CO-Set plus, Baxter Edwards Critical Care, Irvine, CA, \nUSA). Three measurements were made at random points during the respiratory cycle \nand an average value taken for each measurement. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was \nmonitored with a subdural pressure transducer (Camino 110-4B, Integra Lifesciences \nCorp, New Jersey, USA). Correct positioning was confirmed by obtaining an \nappropriate waveform that fluctuated with ventilation. Urine output was monitored \nvia a urethrostomy. Microbiological testing was performed routinely for all animals. \n \n 6\nAcetaminophen administration \nAll animals were pre-treated with phenobarbital 20ml orally per day for 5 days prior \nto each experiment to induce cytochrome p450 enzymes (n=13 pigs). Total \ncytochrome p450 levels were measured using CO difference spectroscopy of sodium \nhydrosulphite samples (14). In nine animals intravenous acetaminophen was \nadministered while four animals were used as controls and monitored invasively but \ndid not receive any acetaminophen infusions. An initial loading dose of \nacetaminophen was administered by intravenous infusion (0.1875g\/kg) followed by \nan infusion for 12 hours (1.8mg\/kg\/min) with the intention of keeping blood \nacetaminophen concentration between 200-300mg\/l (n=9 pigs).  Acetaminophen \nlevels were monitored by bed-side testing using the Acetasite system (Indiana, USA). \nArterial blood gas and lactate levels were measured using a Hewlett Packard I-Stat \npoint-of-care blood analysis system. Methaemoglobin was concurrently measured \nspectrophotometrically as previously described (15).  \n \nExperiments lasted up to 28 hours, and any animals surviving at this time-point were \neuthanased. Necropsy samples of liver, kidney and brain were then taken. Samples \nwere fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at 5microns and \nhaematoxylin & eosin stained for routine histological analysis. \n \nLaboratory measurements: \nStandard laboratory assays were used for the measurement of liver and renal function, \nfull blood count and coagulation parameters( prothrombin time, factors V,VII,VIII). \nSerum aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, potassium and creatinine analysis were \nmeasured on an Olympus AU2700 automated analyser (Olympus UK Ltd, Watford, \nUK.) using proprietary diagnostic kits.  \n \nNMR spectroscopy  \nNMR spectroscopy was used to measure a number of amino acids in serum  to \ncalculate Fischer\u2019s ratio (16), which is the ratio of the aromatic amino acids (tyrosine \nand phenylalanine) to branch chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine). \nReversal of Fischer\u2019s ratio is a reliable marker of development of encephalopathy in \nan anaesthetised model. Samples for NMR spectroscopy were prepared and analysed \nas described previously (17).  \n \nStatistical analysis.  \nResults are presented as means \u00b1 S.E.M, as analysis demonstrated the data to be \nnormally distributed. Significance of the differences between means was assessed \nusing the two-sided t test. Two-sided t test was performed to determine the statistical \ndifference after 24 hours between the two groups. Values of p < 0.05 were considered \nsignificant.\n 7\nResults \nCytochrome p450 levels measured in homogenised liver tissue from phenobarbital \npre-treated animals (n=3 pigs)were significantly higher than in animals which had not \nreceived phenobarbital (300 +\/- 86 vs 100 +\/- 31, p=0.01) pmol\/mg protein. All \nanimals in this study subsequently received phenobarbital \n \nAcetaminophen toxicity and methaemoglobinaemia \nAcetaminophen was administered by intravenous infusion for 12 hours with the \nintention of maintaining blood levels between 200-300mg\/l. By accurate monitoring \nof acetaminophen and methaemoglobin levels this was largely accomplished (figure \n1a) although in two (of nine) animals levels exceeded 400mg\/l. The consequence of \nhigh acetaminophen levels, namely an increasing methaemoglobin percentage, is \ndemonstrated in figure 1b. In injury 7 we were unable to measure acetaminophen \nlevels, and despite following a previously calculated infusion pattern the pig \ndeveloped severe methaemoglobinaemia (peak of 13%). This reinforces the \nimportance of close monitoring of acetaminophen levels. In general, \nmethaemoglobinaemia (>4%) occurred approximately 2-3 hours after acetaminophen \nlevels exceeded 350mg\/l. The finding of other groups, i.e., that brown blood \ndiscolouration presages the development of methaemoglobinaemia was not confirmed \nin the current study. Similarly the use of methylene blue (MB) which has previously \nbeen described as an effective treatment for methaemoglobinaemia, was associated \nwith death within 5 minutes of injection in the single animal of the current study in \nwhich it was administered.   \n \nAnimal survival \nControl pigs (n=4) survived the 28 hour anaesthetic without complications, whilst \nonly two of the nine injured pigs survived to this time-point (see Figure 2a). Two of \nthe animals which received acetaminophen were critically unwell, and were \neuthanased at 25 hours. Three pigs developed a syndrome of multi-organ failure \n(MOF) before death, which is in keeping with the clinical condition (4). Failure of \ntwo or more organ systems was required for MOF to be confirmed: most commonly \nthese were arterial hypotension (refractory to fluid resuscitation) and ventilatory \nfailure. Sepsis was confirmed in two pigs by blood culture (Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand Pseudomonas paucimobilis). Refractory hypotension and\/or difficulties in \nensuring successful ventilation led to a joint decision to euthanase pigs. \n \nCardio respiratory evaluation \nFigures 3a and 3b demonstrate that injured pigs (as opposed to uninjured pigs) \ndeveloped the typical haemodynamic pattern of acute liver injury characterised by \narterial hypotension (40.8\u00b15.9 vs 59\u00b12.0 mmHg, p=0.16) (MAP, mean arterial \npressure), increased cardiac output (CO) (7.26\u00b11.86 vs 3.30\u00b10.40 l\/min, p=0.01) and \ndecreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (8.48\u00b12.75 vs 16.2\u00b11.76 mPa\u00b7s\/m3, \np=0.03) that was unresponsive to fluid infused in an attempt to maintain normal \npulmonary arterial occlusion pressures (PAOP) (figure 4). Positive pressure lung \nventilation was associated with a reduction in total compliance as injury progressed \nand the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (636\u00b195 vs 301\u00b126.9 mPa\u00b7s\/m3, \np<0.01) increased in this group (figure 4).  This may have indicated the onset of an \nadult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like picture.   \n \nLaboratory analysis \n 8\nBiochemical analysis revealed a marked increase in serum AST (471.5\u00b1210 vs \n42\u00b18.14, p=0.03) in conjunction with a marked reduction in serum albumin \n(11.5\u00b11.71 vs 25\u00b11 g\/dL, p=0.03) in injured animals (figure 5a). AST rather than \nALT was used to quantify liver damage as the assay employed was unable to measure \nporcine ALT from homogenised porcine liver tissue. This hepatic dysfunction was \nconfirmed by pH (7.23\u00b10.05 vs 7.45\u00b10.02, p=0.02) and prothrombin time (36\u00b12 vs \n8.87\u00b10.33 seconds, p=0.002) (figure 5b).  Arterial pH decreased significantly in the \ninjured group in parallel with increasing prothrombin times (to a mean of 36seconds \nat 24 hours). The liver components of prothrombin time, factors V and VII were \n(figure 6a) to decrease after injury to levels of 9.3% and 15.5% of normal values \nrespectively. Factor VIII levels remained unchanged indicating that Disseminated \nintravascular coagulation (DIC) was not the main cause for the altered levels of other \ncoagulation factors. \n \nIn addition to liver injury there was evidence of renal impairment as shown in figure 7 \nwhere serum creatinine rises above 250\u00b5mol\/l in injured animals, although serum \npotassium remains below 6mmol\/l. Mean levels of creatinine and potassium were \n280.2\u00b136.5 vs 131.6\u00b19.33 \u00b5mol\/l (p=0.002) and 5.65\u00b10.53 vs 4.6\u00b10.12 mmol\/L \n(p=0.27) respectively. \n \nEvidence of encephalopathy: Fischer\u2019s ratio \nIn the liver injury group there was a significant increase in tyrosine (0.03 \u00b1 0.004 vs \n0.40 \u00b1 0.02) (p<0.008) and phenylalanine concentrations (0.05 \u00b1 0.004 vs 0.71 \u00b1 \n0.08) (p<0.001) by the end of the experiment. There were no statistically significant \nchanges in leucine levels (0.17 \u00b1 0.02 vs 0.175 \u00b1 0.02) although isoleucine increased \nsignificantly (0.08 \u00b1 0.01 vs 0.2 \u00b1 0.01) (p<0.05) while valine levels decreased (0.2 \u00b1 \n0.02 vs 0.13 \u00b1 0.01) (p<0.01). Fischer\u2019s ratio (BCAA\/AAA) was 5.6 \u00b1 1.1 at the \nbeginning and 0.45 \u00b1 0.06 at the end of the study (see Figure 8).  The ratio was \nunchanged in uninjured pigs. \n \nIntracranial pressure (ICP) measurements \nIntracranial pressure did not alter in any of the control or injured animals at any time \nduring the experiment. Mean levels were 8mmHg. Cerebral perfusion pressure was \nless in injured animals, principally because of arterial hypotension; this was not \nassociated with obvious cerebral histopathology.    \n \nHistology \nHistological analysis of liver tissue revealed perivenular and mid-zone confluent \nhepatocytic necrosis in the worst-affected animals, with microvesicular change in \npreserved viable parenchyma. Other animals developed less injury as judged by the \nextent of necrosis, but qualitatively similar patterns (see Figure 9) were seen.  Four \nanimals demonstrated moderately severe liver injury, 2 developed severe coagulative \nnecrosis and 3 developed mild (no zonal confluent necrosis) liver injury. Similarly, \nrenal histopathology of seven pigs revealed severe acute tubular injury as judged by \nthe prevalence of vacuolar change to the cortical tubular epithelium. \n 9\nDiscussion and Conclusions \nThe major role for an ALF model is to provide a more controlled experimental \nenvironment than currently exists (18). An ideal model should satisfy the following \ncriteria: 1) induced hepatic failure should be reversible; 2) the features of liver \ndamage should be reproducible; 3) selective damage should lead to fatal liver failure \nover a period similar to that encountered in the human condition; but 4) with \nsufficient time to allow the option for successful treatment; 5) the model should be \nlarge enough to accommodate anthropocentric therapies; and 6) the toxins used \nshould not be hazardous to laboratory personnel.  A pig model would be preferable as \nit has the potential to fulfil all of these criteria, and also importantly shares very \nsimilar liver metabolic function with human liver (19). \n \nThe porcine model described here develops most of the signs typifying acute liver \ninjury\/failure, namely: tachycardia, hypotension, increased cardiac output, decreased \nsystemic vascular resistance, coagulopathy, renal failure and altered hepatic \nbiochemistry. Consequently, it is the only animal model of acetaminophen-induced \nliver injury large enough to allow monitoring at a level equivalent to intensive care. \nWhilst the outcome of acetaminophen-injured pigs is relatively reproducible there still \nremain some inherent variations highlighting the difficulty of such studies. This \nreinforces the need to perform large studies when using such animals to ensure that \nindividual variations can be accounted for. \n  \nOur model showed the typical increase in cardiac output and reciprocal reductions in \nSVR found in the clinical setting. Of note this is accelerated within the porcine model, \nstarting within 16 hours of the onset of liver damage. This is likely a reflection of pre-\ntreatment with phenobarbitone. The increased PVR in the context of normal PaO2 \nvalues was in keeping with the increased requirement for positive end-expiration \npressure (PEEP) during ventilation.  This may have indicated the onset of an ARDS-\nlike picture, although lung histology would be important to support this conclusion. \nThat PAOP did not increase suggests that the ventilatory changes were not associated \nwith pulmonary oedema secondary to left ventricular failure.  A non-significant \nreduction in PVR Index after liver injury has been described (20). The reason for this \ndifference is unclear. Acute lung injury is common in patients with acetaminophen-\ninduced fulminant hepatic failure and is associated with systemic circulatory failure, \ncerebral oedema and high mortality. \n \nThe marked reduction in Factor V and VII levels in the current model were consistent \nwith severe liver injury. The Clichy criteria (21) deemed a reduction of Factor V \nlevels to <20-30% as the trigger for liver transplantation; this was the case in most \nanimals in this experiment. The absence of changes in Factor VIII levels indicate DIC \nwas not the cause of altered levels of other coagulation factors. \n \nAn increase in AST levels indicated the development of liver necrosis, although these \nwere not as high as are seen in patients. Similarly, a rise in bilirubin did not occur. \nThis may reflect a species-specificity of the assay used, or insufficient time for \nbilirubin to rise. It is possible that there are subtle variations in this model compared \nto humans in that some systemic features prevail over a liver focused pattern of \ninjury.  Liver tissue analysis revealed severe coagulative necrosis in some animals \nwith moderate and mild injury in others. This supports the probability that significant \nliver injury accounts for the clinical syndrome reported here. Although there is some \n 10\nvariability in the liver injury seen in this model, there is still significant liver injury in \nthe majority of animals. Indeed, this variation closely mimics what is seen clinically.  \n \nThere are several explanations for the failure to observe changes in ICP. The time \ncourse may have been too brief.  However, a raised ICP is not always encountered in \nthe clinical setting, or only in association with other factors such as sepsis.  It may \nalso reflect differences in the pathophysiology of drug-induced ALF as opposed to \nischaemic models of ALF. Measurements of arterial ammonia, cerebral blood flow or \nthe use of cerebral microdialysis may help to clarify intracranial effects in future \nstudies. Biochemical analysis suggested that animals may have been developing \nencephalopathy, although in the absence of ICP changes and with general anaesthesia \nit is difficult to be certain. Fischer\u2019s ratio (16), the ratio of the aromatic amino acid \n(AAA; tyrosine and phenylalanine) to branch chain amino acid (BCAA; leucine, \nisoleucine and valine) concentrations has a value of 3 to 4 in clinical liver failure but \nwhen this ratio is reversed and is in absolute figures <1.4 then most patients develop \nhepatic encephalopathy.  \n \nThere was evidence of marked renal impairment, although fatal hyperkalaemia was \nnot observed. Renal dysfunction is an important feature of acetaminophen induced \nliver failure (22), and the renal histology in treated animals was consistent with a \ntoxic injury rather than the distinctive pattern of frank outer medullary tubular \nnecrosis encountered with ischaemia, i.e., critical hypotension. \n \nMethaemoglobinaemia.  \nThis study demonstrates the importance of continuous monitoring of acetaminophen \nlevels, the one animal from which it was withheld died from methaemoglobinaemia. \nThe amount of acetaminophen required to maintain levels between 200-300mg\/l for \n12 hours was calculated beforehand, but it was necessary in every case to reduce the \ninfusion rate (and the total dose administered) as acetaminophen levels exceeded this \nrange.   Levels greater than 250mg\/l increased serum methaemoglobin levels, although \nthis usually resolved by stopping the acetaminophen infusion which allowed plasma \nlevels to fall. Acetaminophen and its intermediates oxidise haemoglobin to \nmethaemoglobin, which is unable to carry oxygen. Although it occurs in human \nbeings, it is less marked than in cats, dogs, and pigs. In some species, methemoglobin \nis reduced to hemoglobin by the methemoglobin reductase using reduced glutathione \n(GHS) as a substrate. GSH itself is recycled by the glutathione reductase, using \nreduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) from the pentose \nphosphate pathway. Due to the glucose impermeability of porcine red blood cells \n(compared with rats and rabbits) there is a diminution in generation of NADPH and \nhence decreased reduction of methaemoglobin (23). Levels of methaemoglobinaemia \nin pigs (24) administered acetaminophen are only one-half those reported in cats (25) \nand dogs (26).  There are several measures to control methaemoglobin levels in \nanimal models.  Kelly et al (8) suspected high plasma acetaminophen levels were \nresponsible for lethal methaemoglobinaemia and so tried to prevent them.  Not having \naccess to bedside testing and thus being unable to prevent high acetaminophen levels \nthey administered MB at 10mg\/kg if the blood appeared brown on visual inspection.  \nThe usefulness of this strategy was not confirmed in the current study. \n \nMethylene blue is the recognized clinical treatment for methaemoglobinaemia and \nacts by reducing methaemoglobin back to haemoglobin. Its action depends on the \n 11\navailability of adequate NADPH concentrations within the erythrocyte; a deficiency \nof NADPH availability leads to further methaemoglobinaemia.  On the single \noccasion it was used in the current study the animal died of cardiovascular collapse 5 \nminutes later.  \n \nPresence of anaemia. Miller et al (12) found that the haematocrit fell rapidly (25% \ndecrease from the initial packed cell volume) in sixty percent of animals 1 to 2 hours \nbefore death.  The cause of anaemia in their study was unclear, and may reflect \nextravascular haemolysis within the spleen.  The haemoglobin nor haematocrit levels \ndid not fall in either the control nor the treatment groups in the current study. \n \nIn summary, we have described the first intensively monitored porcine model of \nacetaminophen-induced severe liver injury which displays most of the features seen in \nthe human condition.  This large animal model can play an important role in the \nevaluation of the effectiveness of liver support systems, as well as providing us with \nthe ability to develop a much better understanding of the pathophysiology of this \ndevastating clinical syndrome.  \n \n \n \n \n 12\nCompeting interests \nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests. \n \nAuthors' contributions \nPNN, NCH, CF, LJN, AL, TK carried out the studies and drafted the manuscript. \nREC  carried out the studies.

Acetaminophen levels for individual pigs are noted, with the corresponding \nmethaemoglobin levels illustrated in panel B. Acetaminophen levels of between 200 \n300mg\/l were aimed for although even with frequent measurements and reductions in \nthe infusion rate there were rises often to 400mg\/l. Prolonged elevation of levels \nabove 300mg\/l did lead to a rise in methaemoglobin. For pig 7 facilities to measure \nacetaminophen levels were unavailable and this led to a marked rise in \nmethaemoglobin levels. \n 16\nFigure 2 Kaplan Meier survival curve for control and acetaminophen injured \npigs \n \n (A) The control group (Group 0) as demonstrated by the uninterrupted line all \nsurvived, and indeed appeared healthy when euthanased. The injury group (Group 1) \nas demonstrated by the interrupted line died as denoted in the Kaplan-Meier curve. \nTwo animals* were euthanased at 25 hours as they appeared particularly unwell, and \nanother further two were euthanased at the end of the experiment with no obvious ill \neffects from acetaminophen administration. \n \n(B) This table outlines the likeliest cause of death along with a correlation with the \namount of liver and renal injury. In most cases the cause of death was multi-organ \nfailure (MOF) with evidence of hypotension, marked oedema, oliguria and ventilatory \ndifficulties. In two animals organisms were identified in routine blood cultures. In pig \n2 a cavitating lung abscess was identified although this was in addition to liver and \nrenal injury. However in pig 9 Pseudomonas paucimobilis was identified in blood \ncultures with little evidence of significant renal or liver damage. +++ covered severe \nhepatic coagulative necrosis, ++ covered moderate hepatic coagulative necrosis and + \ncovered mild hepatic coagulative necrosis. Similarly the scoring scale for renal injury \ncovered the range from mild (+) to moderate (++) to severe (+++) tubular necrosis. \n \nPig 7 developed significant methaemoglobinaemia (>10%). Administration of \nMethylene blue led to circulatory collapse and death within 5 minutes. Pig 8 had \nmoderately elevated levels of methaemoglobinaemia (>4%), and shortly before death \ndropped its oxygen saturations to 40%. No additional contributory cause to death was \nidentified. \n 17\nFigure 3 Profile of Pulse, Mean Arterial pressure, Cardiac Output and Systemic \nVascular Resistance in control and acetaminophen injured pigs \n \nChart A demonstrates a progressive increase in pulse and concomitant reduction in \nMAP following liver injury. Furthermore, chart B demonstrates a marked increase in \ncardiac output (CO) and decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) following liver \ninjury. These haemodynamic changes are in keeping with the multi-organ failure seen \nin acute liver injury. \n 18\nFigure 4 Profile of Pulmonary Artery Occlusion Pressure and Pulmonary \nVascular Resistance in control and acetaminophen injured pigs \n \nFluid resuscitation was guided by Pulmonary Artery Occlusion Pressure (PAOP), and \ntherefore this was similar between the two groups. Pulmonary Vascular Resistance \n(PVR) became noticeably higher in the acetaminophen injured pigs. This was also \nseen in an increased ventilatory requirement in the latter stages of the injury \nexperiments. \n 19\nFigure 5 Profile of serum AST, serum Albumin, arterial pH and plasma \nProthrombin time in control and acetaminophen injured pigs \n \nPanel A depicts the increase in serum AST and concomitant reduction in serum \nalbumin in acetaminophen injured pigs. This pattern of liver injury was also seen in \npanel B, where arterial pH drops and Prothrombin time increases.  \n 20\nFigure 6 Profile of the plasma coagulation factors V and VII in control and \nacetaminophen injured pigs \n \nThe levels of plasma coagulation factors V and VII can be seen to markedly reduce in \nacetaminophen injured pigs in keeping with the previously observed prolongation of \nprothrombin time. \n 21\nFigure 7 Profile of serum Creatinine and Potassium in control and \nacetaminophen injured pigs \n \nThis panel depicts the development of renal injury in acetaminophen injured pigs as \nassessed by serum Creatinine and Potassium. \n 22\nFigure 8 Fischer\u2019s ratio in acetaminophen injured pigs \n \nFischer\u2019s ratio, a ratio of the concentrations of aromatic amino acids (tyrosine and \nphenylalanine) to branch chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) is \ndemonstrated in the panel.
