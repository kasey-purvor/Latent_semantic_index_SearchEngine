Here we report the outcomes of a \nstudy comparing the views and expectations of first year biological science undergraduate \nstudents and academic staff regarding feedback provision and utilisation. The results \nindicate that while students and staff are generally satisfied with the feedback process, there \nare some tensions generated by perceived differences in desired academic outcomes. In \nparticular, these tensions focus on perceptions of inconsistency in the feedback processes \nand in the use made of feedback to inform future practice.\nKeywords: feedback, survey\nIntroduction\nIt is well recognised that feedback plays a critical part in student learning (Ramaprasad, 1983; \nHattie et al., 1996; Black and Wiliam, 1998; Hattie and Jaeger, 1998). The importance of \nproviding feedback that is understandable, timely and that students can act on is emphasised \nas an integral part of the empowerment of students as \u2018self-regulated learners\u2019 (Gibbs and \nSimpson, 2004). However, despite general acknowledgement of the importance of feedback \nto learning and development, the recent UK National Student Surveys (2005\u20132007) have \nhighlighted students\u2019 relative dissatisfaction with the feedback they receive (HEFCE, 2006).\nAlthough feedback from formative assessment can be given in many different forms (Hyland, \n2000), as student numbers increase direct interactions between staff and students inevitably \ndecline, leading to a greater reliance on written feedback. Academic staff devote considerable \namounts of time to providing feedback to students but anecdotal evidence would suggest that \nthey are unclear to what extent the students engage with the feedback provided and whether \nthe intended messages are transmitted successfully. It has been suggested (Higgins et al., \n2001, 2002) that feedback may not be effectively used by all students due to differences in how \nstudents understand feedback and therefore make sense of their assessments. Orsmond et al., \n(2005) suggested that for feedback to be effective there needs to be a common understanding \nby both staff and students of the purpose of feedback and how it should be used. \nA number of reasons have been proposed as to why students do not fully utilise feedback \n(Wojtas, 1998; Glover and Brown, 2006): some students will only look at the grade given \nbecause they believe it provides them with a clear, meaningful reflection of their progress \n(Ecclestone, 1998); some students will only read feedback comments if the mark they receive \nis outside their expectations (Taras, 2003). However, an additional group of students may not \nread or take the feedback advice on board because they do not fully understand or realise \nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\nthe potential use of the comments (Chanock, 2000). This thinking may be exacerbated by the \nmodular structure of many degrees where students often do not receive feedback on assessed \nwork until after a module has finished (Lea and Strierer 2000). One approach to try to overcome \nsuch effects of degree modularisation is the delivery of feedback in a form that encourages \n\u2018feed-forward\u2019 reflection by students, as suggested by Higgins et al., (2001). \nNicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) have identified seven principles of good feedback practice, \nwhich they broadly define as \u2018anything that might strengthen the students\u2019 capacity to self-\nregulate their own performance\u2019. However, although feedback which follows these guidelines \nis likely to be constructive, research has also shown that it has a limited effect if students do \nnot actively engage with it (Fritz et al., 2000).\nThe study reported here provides a comprehensive examination of the perceptions regarding \nfeedback given on the first year of the Biological Sciences degree at the University of Leicester. \nFor the thirteen modules taught in the First Year, written feedback is predominant and is given \nto students on their practical write-ups, presentations and essays through a formal School of \nBiological Sciences feedback sheet, recently (January 2007) re-designed to encourage staff \nto more easily identify areas of strengths and to suggest points for improvement in an attempt \nto encourage \u2018feed-forward\u2019 practice by students.  To encourage early engagement with their \nstudies, biological science students are required to complete their first assessed piece of work \nand receive feedback on it within ten days of starting their course and subsequently submit \nassessments and receive feedback weekly throughout the first semester. Although a structured \napproach to giving feedback is encouraged within the School of Biological Sciences, there \nremains a range of variables which impact on how staff and students perceive the role of \nfeedback, including differences in staff approaches, differences in assessment format and \ndifferences in subject matter. The aims of this study were to compare the perceptions of \nstudents and staff on a number of aspects of feedback on the first year of the biological science \ndegree and on the relationship that this feedback has to student learning.\nResearch Methodology\nResearch was conducted into the views and perceptions of staff and students regarding \nfeedback using a combination of online questionnaire, focus groups and interviews. Interviews \nand focus groups were recorded and transcribed. Permission for recording was sought prior \nto the start of interviews and confidentiality ensured by anonymising transcripts.  Management \nof the project was undertaken by a research assistant who was not involved in any aspect \nof teaching delivery within the School. Academic staff did not participate in recruitment of \nstudents or in conducting focus groups to obviate any likelihood of students\u2019 responses being \nbiased by an academic presence.\nFeedback Questionnaire\nAn anonymous \u2018feedback questionnaire\u2019 based on Gibbs\u2019 Assessment Experience Questionnaire \n(Gibbs and Simpson, 2003) was posted on the University\u2019s virtual learning environment, \nBlackboard\u2122, for a total of nine weeks during Semester 2. This sought views on students\u2019 \nperceptions of a number of aspects of feedback, including quantity, timing, use and quality. \nResponses were given using a five-point Likert scale ranging from \u2018strongly agree\u2019 to \u2018strongly \ndisagree\u2019. Reliability analysis was performed to determine Cronbach\u2019s Alpha using SPSS. \nStudent focus groups\nStudent Focus Groups: Students across the range of academic performance were selected for \nparticipation in focus groups based on their 1st semester module results. Ten students were \nallocated to each of four focus groups conducted over four consecutive weeks. Overall, 20 \nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\nstudents were involved in the study. The students\u2019 range of academic performance and male: \nfemale ratio that was representative of the year group as a whole. Focus group discussions \nwere semi-structured in nature, covering aspects of feedback as in the feedback questionnaire \nand were led by members of staff who were not involved in teaching within the School.  This \napproach allowed flexibility of discussions and provided an informal environment in which the \nstudents felt able to give their views on all aspects of feedback, both positive and negative \n(Orsmond et al., 2005). The recording of focus group sessions did not, in the main, appear to \nrestrict discussions with students freely naming both modules and staff in their comments.  \nStaff Interviews\nViews and perceptions of staff regarding feedback were collated during one-on-one interviews \nwith three groups of Course Convenors (13); Personal Tutors (7) and Student Learning Centre \nstaff (1) with responsibility for biological science students. Interviews were conducted using \na semi-structured discussion format based on aspects of feedback covered in the feedback \nquestionnaire and focus groups. Permission for recording was sought prior to the start of \ninterviews and confidentiality ensured by anonymising participants in transcripts. Recording of \nthe interviews did not, in the main, appear to restrict comments and only one member of staff \ndeclined to be recorded Transcripts were analysed as previously described for focus groups. \nAs participation in the study by course convenors was high, the views of staff expressed here \nare a good representation of those responsible for the teaching of, and giving feedback to, 1st \nyear biological science students.\nEthical Approval\nEthical permission for the study was obtained in accordance with the University of Leicester \nresearch protocol for non-clinical projects concerning human subjects.\nResults\nFeedback Questionnaire\nThe response rate to the feedback questionnaire was 56.9% (n=45) and reliability analysis gave \na Cronbach\u2019s Alpha value of 0.748 (n=26) indicating the questionnaire data to be trustworthy. \nFeedback questionnaire respondents were grouped according to the degree classes obtained \nin the first semester, and all classes were found to be represented (Figure 1).\nStudent focus groups\nForty-one 1st year biological science students (51.9% of the year group) were invited to one of \nfour focus group sessions and, of those, twenty students (25.3% of year) attended. The final \nfocus group cohort was representative of all degree classes (Figure 1) with a Male:Female \nratio of 1:1.5 (in comparison with 1:1.39 for the year group as a whole). \nPerceptions and Function of Feedback\nTo initiate discussions, focus group participants were asked to \u2018think about what you see as \nfeedback, what are the different types of feedback that you\u2019ve experienced [on the course to \ndate]?\u2019 All students readily identified written feedback via the formal School feedback sheets \nfor practical write-ups and essays and, when prompted, also referred to feedback from oral \npresentations. In general, annotations on scripts were not discussed unprompted as a form \nof feedback until later in the sessions. Verbal feedback was considered to mainly come from \ndemonstrators during laboratory practical classes. However, students also viewed contact with \nPersonal Tutors as being a source of verbal feedback. \nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\nFor comparison, Course Convenors were asked for \u2018their perceptions of what students regarded \nas feedback\u2019. Formal written feedback on the School feedback sheets and annotations on \nscripts were identified by all Convenors, which was in agreement with the students.  Although \nCourse Convenors regarded interactions with demonstrators and practical leaders in laboratory \nclasses as giving students (verbal) feedback, staff opinion was divided as to whether students \nappreciated this, as typified by a comment from a course convenor,\n\u201cThey [the students] are probably less aware of the direct help they get by talking to \npeople in lab classes, I think\u201d.\nStudent perceptions of the function of feedback were ascertained during focus groups with \nparticipants being asked \u2018what do you think the purpose, or function of feedback is on your \ndegrees?\u2019. All students immediately identified the main function of feedback as helping them to \nimprove their next piece of work, \n\u201cIs it to take it in and improve future work, because they\u2019ve told you what you\u2019ve done \nwrong so you don\u2019t make the same mistake again?\u201d\nWhen prompted, all students acknowledged feedback could also be used to show strengths \nand weaknesses in a piece of work, to justify the grade given and to highlight general errors in \nspelling, punctuation and referencing.\n \nFor comparative purposes, staff were also asked: \u2018how would you define feedback?\u2019.  All members \nof staff defined feedback in terms of giving students an appraisal of their performance,\n\u201cI guess feedback is exactly what it says, it\u2019s giving students information about their \nperformance in a piece of work, obviously with a view to their improving or maintaining \ntheir level\u201d \nIn addition, Course Convenors and personal tutors were asked \u2018what do you consider the \nfunction of feedback to be?\u2019; staff were in agreement with students, linking feedback to \ninforming the student of their performance in a particular task, and providing information on \nhow to improve in subsequent pieces of work, \n 0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nFirst 2.1 2.2 3\/A Pass Fail\nDegree Class\nPe\nrc\nen\nta\nge\n o\nf T\not\nal\n Questionnaire\nFocus Group\nFigure 1 Degree class representation in study cohorts for Feedback Questionnaire (n=45) and Focus Groups \n(n=20).

Quantity of Feedback\nThe feedback questionnaire contained four questions relating to the quantity of feedback \nreceived on the 1st year of the biological science degree, and student responses are shown \nin Table 1.\nTable 1 \u2018Feedback Questionnaire\u2019 responses from 1st year BS students regarding aspects of the quantity of \nfeedback received on 1st year BS degree. Figures represent the percentage of total responses (n= 45). Students \nagree = strongly agree and agree; students disagree = strongly disagree and disagree.\nResponse\nStudents agree\n(%)\nStudents neither \nagree nor disagree (%)\nStudents disagree\n(%)\nQ1: On this course I get plenty of  \nfeedback on how  I am doing. 66.7 20.0 13.1\nQ4: I don\u2019t like to receive too \nmuch feedback. 4.4 13.3 82.3\nQ5: The feedback on my \nassignments is usually  too \nuninformative or brief to be \nhelpful.\n35.1 40.0 24.4\nQ6: The more feedback I receive \nthe more I learn. 88.9 8.9 2.2\nFor comparison, focus group participants were asked, \u2018In general, do you think there is enough \nfeedback on the course?\u2019. Just over half of the students in the focus groups supported the \nfeedback questionnaire findings,\n\u201cYeah mostly I\u2019m happy with the amount of feedback. If sometimes it\u2019s a little vague, \nespecially with the practical reports, but personally I\u2019m happy\u201d \n\u201cYou don\u2019t want essays of feedback, you want a few points but good points that will \nhelp you improve\u201d. \nHowever, the remainder did not agree that there was enough feedback which, despite having \nbeen asked to think in general terms, may have been module-specific criticism. In addition, \nstudents in all focus groups invariably commented on the inconsistencies in the feedback they \nreceived, both within and between modules, and this may have been a contributing factor to \nthe less positive response for Q5 of the feedback questionnaire compared with Q1 (above). \n2.  Timing of Feedback\nThe feedback questionnaire contained three questions relating to the timing of feedback \nreceived on the 1st year of the Biological Science degree, and student responses are shown \nin Table 2.\nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\nTable 2 \u2018Feedback Questionnaire\u2019 responses from 1st year BS students regarding aspects of the timing of feedback \nreceived on 1st year BS degree. Figures represent the percentage of total responses (n= 45). Students agree = \nstrongly agree and agree; students disagree = strongly disagree and disagree.\nResponse\nStudents agree\n(%)\nStudents neither \nagree nor disagree \n(%)\nStudents disagree\n(%)\nQ2: It doesn\u2019t  matter if a module \nhas finished before I  receive \nfeedback as I know the advice       \nwill be  relevant to my new \nmodule.\n51.1 33.3 15.6\nQ3: The feedback usually comes \nback promptly. 55.6 26.7 17.8\nQ7: Whatever feedback I receive \ncomes back too late to be useful. 15.1 35.6 48.8\nFocus group participants were asked for their general views on the \u2018turnaround\u2019 time (time taken \nto receive marked assessment with feedback) for feedback on the Biological Science degree. \nStudents readily identified differences in \u2018turnaround\u2019 times for different types of assessed \nwork, with the greatest concern being expressed about laboratory practical work where the \ngeneral theme of inconsistency both within and between modules was again highlighted.\n\u201c. . . all that [turnaround time] depends on the demonstrator. This time we\u2019ve had one \nwho was taking sometimes two weeks to get them [practical reports] back. Another one \nhas got them back [within the week], so it depends really on who you\u2019ve got\u201d.\nStudents were particularly focused on receiving feedback from a previous practical report prior \nto writing the next one in the series. However, the \u2018turnaround\u2019 time for feedback on essays \nand oral presentations appeared to be less of an issue with comments having less \u2018urgency\u2019 \nassociated with them. A minority (3\/20) of focus group participants supported the feedback \nquestionnaire findings in expressing the view that feedback given at the end of a module, or \nafter a module had finished was still useful:\n\u201cIt might be too late for that module but it can be usually applied to the next module.\u201d\nViews of course convenors on timing of feedback were also ascertained (where appropriate \nto module structure). When asked \u2018what is the turnaround time for your module?\u2019, Course \nConvenors in general recognised the importance of returning feedback as quickly as possible; \nwith practical write-ups, most Module Convenors endeavoured to return scripts and feedback \nin time for the next practical session. Whether this was always achievable was acknowledged \nas an issue by some members of staff. The turnaround time for essays was generally quoted \nby Course Convenors as the School requirement of three weeks, with some Course Convenors \naiming for a quicker turnaround if possible. Due to the structure of modules, the majority of \nfeedback on essay assessments was given after the module had finished. In order to address \nthe usefulness of such feedback, Course Convenors were asked, \u2018If the feedback doesn\u2019t get \nto them [the students] within the module, would it still be useful to them?\u2019 Course Convenors \nresponded more positively than the students, with seven out of the eight Course Convenors \nexpressing the view that feedback comments received after a module had finished would be \nuseful for the student in future modules. \nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\n3. Use of Feedback \nThe feedback questionnaire contained seven questions relating to the uses of feedback by \nfirst-year biological science students, and responses are shown in Table 3.\nTable 3 \u2018Feedback Questionnaire\u2019 responses from 1st year BS students regarding aspects of their use of \nfeedback received on 1st year BS degree.

What they did subsequently was variable: for some, the \nmark obtained would influence any further action,\n\u201cA lot of the time it\u2019ll depend on the mark as to how much I do look at it [the feedback]. \nIf I\u2019ve got a really high mark I\u2019ll tend to look and think \u2018oh I\u2019ve done well and just put it \naway. If I\u2019ve got a really bad mark I\u2019ll look and think what I\u2019ve done wrong, why I got \nthat mark\u201d,\n\u201cIf I expect a mark, low or high, and it\u2019s that, I don\u2019t really read the comments. If I get a \nmark that\u2019s really different from what I expected then I\u2019ll really read the comments\u201d. \nFor others, however, the mark had no influence over their use of the feedback. It also became \napparent that when students received their work and feedback sheets, after looking through \nthem individually they would also compare their work with that of their peers, \n\u201cWhen we get them [marked worked] back I tend to compare them with my friends and \nsee what we\u2019ve picked up marks from.\u201d \nFeedback questionnaire data did not clearly define whether students were using a \u2018feed-\nforward\u2019 practice in their utilisation of feedback. This area was explored further during focus \ngroup discussions and, in general, when students were asked about their use of feedback, \nthey appeared to describe a \u2018feed-forward\u2019 approach,\nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\n\u201cI look at the mark and the improvements, look through my script and file them away. \nOccasionally I\u2019ll look back at them. When I\u2019m doing the [next] report I\u2019ll look at last \nweek\u2019s to see what I can do differently\u201d. \nStudents were also asked for their perceptions of how the staff thought they used feedback. \nResponses to this were varied, from negative statements,\n \u201cThey probably think we don\u2019t read it and just put it to one side\u201d, \n\u201cI\u2019m sure some of them think they\u2019re just doing it and it\u2019s a bit pointless and you\u2019re not \ngoing to look at it anyway\u201d. \nto a rather more positive view,\n\u201cI suppose some of them [markers] must hope that if they bother to write something \ndown then it gets read. But they must accept that there\u2019s a great deal of variation \nbetween students\u201d. [variation in how the feedback will be used by students]\nWhen asked the question: \u2018do students utilise the feedback they are given?\u2019 Course Convenors \nand personal tutors were divided in their opinions. Some were very positive in their response \nand had seen clear evidence of improvement in students work following feedback, particularly \nin practical write-ups,\n\u201cMy experience is that feedback is definitely used, it\u2019s a very constructive thing, a useful \nthing and a good proportion of students are using feedback\u201d, \n\u201cI think we did see that with the practicals this year, with us being able to turn them \naround so quickly. We did see an improvement in the marks\u2026just looking at my own \ngroup you could see they were improving for example their graph drawing skills\u201d.\nOthers expressed the view that the students\u2019 use of feedback would depend on how close the \nmark given was to that expected by the student,\n\u201cI think it depends on what they [the student] were expecting and how close to what \nthey were expecting was achieved. \u2026.\u201d \nThis view had been confirmed by some students participating in the focus groups. Staff also \nagreed with the students\u2019 views that utilisation of feedback by students was inconsistent,\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very variable. I think the current students are so geared to passing tests that \nthey see every piece of work as passing a test rather than a learning process. ....If they \ndon\u2019t get the best possible mark and there are lots of comments on it then they feel \nthey haven\u2019t done very well. They don\u2019t pay attention to the fact that doing the essay is \na learning experience\u201d. \nSome course convenors and personal tutors also expressed the opinion that although they \nconsidered that students did utilise feedback, proving that the source of any improvement in \nstudents\u2019 work was due to the feedback given was difficult. \n4. Quality of Feedback \nThe feedback questionnaire contained five questions relating to the clarity of feedback \ncomments received on the first-year biological science degree, and responses are shown in \nTable 4.1\nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\nTable 4.1 \u2018Feedback Questionnaire\u2019 responses from 1st year BS students regarding aspects of the clarity of feedback \ncomments received on 1st year BS degree. Figures represent the percentage of total responses (n= 45). Students \nagree = strongly agree and agree; students disagree = strongly disagree and disagree\nResponse Students agree(%)\nStudents neither \nagree nor disagree \n(%)\nStudents disagree\n(%)\nQ8: The feedback I receive \nuses language that is easy to \nunderstand.\n86.7 11.1 2.2\nQ11: I don\u2019t understand some of \nthe feedback.\n24.4 22.2 53.3\nQ12: Constructive criticism\nmotivates me to improve.\n84.4 15.6 0\nQ17: I have ignored negative or \ncritical feedback.\n8.9 24.4 72.7\nQ18: I find it more helpful to receive \nfeedback about what I got wrong \nthan on what I got right.\n48.9 35.6 15.5\nFocus group discussions supported the feedback questionnaire findings in agreeing that \nfeedback was written in language that was easy to understand. However, there were comments \nfrom a few students regarding the legibility of some of the feedback given and this may have \ncontributed to the responses to Q11 compared with Q8. The response of the students from the \nfeedback questionnaire showed that they were motivated by constructive criticism, which was \nagain supported by focus group participants,\n\u201cFor one of the modules the first week I got 70[%] and she [the marker] put some \nimprovement points. The next week I included those and she remembered and \ncommented on it and I got a higher mark. That was good because it was the feedback \nworking\u201d. \nStudents were clear, however, that they do not ignore any negative or critical feedback. The \nfeedback questionnaire data showed that students, in general, considered feedback on what \nthey had got wrong was most helpful. This was supported in focus group discussions, with \nparticipants expressing the need to be shown clearly what they had got wrong in order to \nimprove their next piece of assessed work,\n\u201cNegative feedback, although it can be a bit sad, is actually more helpful. Positive \nfeedback is good for bolstering confidence; negative feedback is good for improving\u201d. \nThe feedback questionnaire also contained seven questions relating to the effectiveness of \nfeedback comments received on the 1st year biological science degree, and responses are \nshown in Table 4.2.\nFocus group discussions provided some clarification of the apparent contradictions in the \nresponses obtained in the feedback questionnaire,\n\u201cTo be honest, the forms that come back with the feedback don\u2019t help all that much. \nThey may have points on where I went wrong, but no points on how to improve it\u201d. \nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\nThe examples of unhelpful feedback shown were where work had been returned with blank \nfeedback sheets, with only the mark written on them. When asked, students commented \nthat this was not uncommon, but again was very variable between markers and modules. In \naddition, a lack of comments on the feedback sheet did not always appear to be replaced by \na wealth of annotations on the script itself. Lack of annotation also seemed to contribute to an \napparent uncertainty from the students as to how they had gained marks in assessed work,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you got marks for so you don\u2019t know what to include next time. \nAs well as not knowing how to move on you don\u2019t know how to get to the same place \nagain\u201d.\nDiscussion\nThe aim of the study reported here was to compare the views of students and staff on a number \nof aspects of the feedback process currently in place on the first year of the biological science \ndegree at the University of Leicester. Although previous studies have reported on feedback \npractice (Mutch, 2003; Nichol and Macfarlane-Dick, 2006) and its utilisation by students (Higgens \net al.; 2002, Orsmond et al.; 2005, Weaver 2006) few have directly compared perceptions of \nfeedback from both the staff and student perspective (Maclellan 2001; Carless 2006). \n \nTable 4.2 \u2018Feedback Questionnaire\u2019 responses from 1st year BS students regarding the effectiveness of feedback \ncomments received on 1st year BS degree.

For each focus group, participants were asked to bring with them an example \nof feedback they had found useful and an example that they had not found useful,\n\u201cI got one [write-up] which was 90% and she [the marker] was still like \u2018you could \nimprove it here or here\u2019. It was quite a lot of comments considering it was a high mark \nand it was really good because it was \u2018ok, that\u2019s what I need to be doing\u201d. \nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\nPerceptions and Function of Feedback\nThe primary source of feedback identified by both staff and students was the formal written \nfeedback given via the School feedback sheet and through annotations on scripts. This is \nunsurprising in light of the fact that the majority of feedback given and received on the 1st year \nbiological science degree is in this format. Other types of feedback received are potentially \nless obviously identified, as highlighted by Gibbs et al. (2003) who proposed that although staff \nwould perceive verbal comments as feedback, students may not do so. Academic staff in the \nSchool of Biological Sciences supported this view, regarding student interactions with practical \nleaders and demonstrators in laboratory sessions as verbal feedback, but were divided in \ntheir opinion as to whether students also perceived it as such. In contrast, however, students \nidentified interactions in practical sessions as their primary source of verbal feedback, and the \nreliance of the students on and preference for this source of feedback became very clear during \nfocus group discussions. Staff recognition of the impact of this source of feedback on 1st year \nstudents was not apparent during one-on-one interviews. Contact with Personal Tutors was an \nadditional source of verbal feedback identified by the students for obtaining feedback on their \nprogress in general and on exam marks. \nThe main identified function of feedback from both staff and students\u2019 perspective was to \nprovide information, based on the analysis of performance of a specific task, on how to improve \ncurrent and future pieces of work. However, although staff also recognised other more general \nfunctions of feedback such as identification of errors in spelling or referencing and justification \nof the mark given, students only did so when prompted.\nQuantity of Feedback\nStudents were generally positive about the quantity of feedback they received and, further, \nlinked learning and feedback in a positive way. However, it was apparent that, at a more \nspecific level, the students were less satisfied with the actual amount of writing, or its quality, as \nindicated by the fact that 35% of them agreed with the statement that the feedback is usually \ntoo brief or uninformative to be helpful. \nTiming of Feedback\nStudents\u2019 views on the timing of feedback appeared to be influenced by module-specific \nthinking, as focus group participants reported delays in receiving feedback from individual \nmodules or individual demonstrators. This is reflected in that only 18% of the students in the \nfeedback questionnaire disagreed that feedback is returned promptly but where there were \ninconsistencies of practice, these were particularly flagged in the focus groups. \nStudents and staff acknowledged the importance of prompt feedback and staff aimed to turn \nround marking and feedback on practical write-ups for return to students prior to their next \nsubmission. Some staff supported the students\u2019 view in admitting that turnaround of marking and \nfeedback could be delayed if markers had a heavy marking load. These observations highlight \nthe importance of managing and meeting expectations in terms of the timing of feedback. In \ncontrast to practical write-ups, feedback on some oral presentations and particularly essays on \nthe 1st year biological science degree is received after a module has finished, with turnaround \nbeing quoted by staff as the School requirement of three weeks. Only 16% of students concurred \nwith the view that comments received after a module has finished cannot help them improve \nas they are module specific (Hartley and Chesworth (2000); Carless (2006)) and 7\/8 staff \nagreed that feedback following a module would still be useful. These results further support \nthe differential effects of the benefit of immediate feedback on task orientated work (practical \nwrite ups) versus the benefit of delayed feedback on the acquisition of fluency building in essay \nwriting (reviewed in Hattie and Timperley, 2007). There is also an issue relating to the timing \nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\nof next submission, in that the intervals between essay submission typically extended beyond \nthe three-week turnaround time for the marking.\nUse of feedback\nIt has been reported (Weaver, 2006) that students may need advice on understanding and \nusing feedback before they can fully engage with it. At the time of this study no formal guidance \nwas given to students on the biological science degree as to how to understand and use \nfeedback, however, as a consequence of this research it has now been included as part of the \nfirst-semester \u2018Study & Communication Skills\u2019 module. \nOne of the anecdotal preconceptions regarding students\u2019 use of feedback is that they are \nonly interested in the mark awarded. The majority of our focus group participants agreed \nthat the mark was the first thing that they looked for from feedback. As one member of staff \ncommented though, \u201cstudents are now so geared towards passing tests that they see every \npiece of work as a test rather than a learning experience\u201d, which may contribute strongly to \nthis behaviour. Although some students admitted that their subsequent use of feedback would \ndepend on how close the mark was to that expected, most students were very keen to read \ntheir feedback. Inevitably, staff participants were divided in their opinion as to whether students \nutilised feedback; staff perceptions of students not doing so may have formed, in particular, \nfrom the failure of students to collect marked work. Furthermore, it is recognized that feedback \nmay not necessarily be effective because although the guidance offered can be accepted, it \ncan also be modified or rejected (Kulhavy, 1977) Both staff and students, therefore, accepted \nthe variability in extent of use of feedback, with staff ultimately feeling that once provided it \nwas the students\u2019 responsibility to act on feedback given. Interestingly, the comments from the \nstudent focus groups indicate that the students perceive the staff as holding more negative \nviews about the use the students make of the feedback than is the case. \nA previous study (Duncan, 2007) reported that one important reason why students may \nnot utilise feedback is \u2018a lack of appreciation that comments on one assignment could help \nachievement in a later one\u2019. The term \u2018feeding-forward\u2019 has been adopted (Higgins et al., \n2001) to describe the process of utilisation of feedback to improve future work. In the study \nreported here there was a degree of disagreement between staff and students as to whether \nfeedback comments from one module on the biological science degree could successfully \nbe \u2018fed-forward\u2019 into a different module. Although some focus group participants appeared to \ndescribe a \u2018feed-forward\u2019 approach to their utilisation of feedback, none of the staff could easily \nidentify where this was demonstrable in practice. \nFrom the study data, it was encouraging to find that students on the biological science degree \nlinked feedback and learning in a positive way and this was reinforced by some focus group \nparticipants who acknowledged that acting on feedback comments had led to an improvement \nin their grades. Although staff also acknowledged improvements in students\u2019 work following \nfeedback, some considered the link difficult to prove.\nQuality of Feedback\nOne of the main aims of this study was to determine perception of the effectiveness of feedback \nreceived by students on the 1st year of the biological science degree. In general, students \nwere positive about the clarity of the language used in feedback, although there were some \ncriticisms regarding legibility of writing and the brevity of the comments. It was clear from \nstudents\u2019 responses that positive comments motivated them by bolstering confidence, but \nstudents expressed the view that comments showing errors in a piece of work would help \nthem most to improve their next assessment. However, it is of equal importance that students \nare also shown what was right with their work and where marks were gained, in order that they \nVolume 12: December 2008 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol12\/beej-12-1.pdf\ncan at least repeat their performance in future work. This correlates with the observations of \nHattie and Timperley (2007) that praise on its own has very little value because of the limited \ninformation content. However, positive comments related directly to aspects of the production \nof the work can have significant feed-forward benefit. \nStaff generally acknowledged the importance of couching feedback comments in positive terms \nand appreciating that to firstly identify strengths of a piece of work when marking was of benefit \nto the student, both in terms of confidence-building but also in terms of highlighting where \ngood practice should be continued. However, many staff also commented that they sometimes \nfound it difficult to identify strengths in a very poor piece of work and to write comments that did \nnot sound banal. Staff agreed with the students in believing that negative comments should not \nbe excluded from feedback and that there should be a balance between the two types.  \nStudents were of the general opinion that the feedback they received was good at pointing \nout what was wrong with a piece of work but did not always give enough guidance on how \nto improve; furthermore they felt it was often not made clear where they had gained marks. It \nwas a common claim from staff that time pressures resulting from high student numbers on the \n1st year meant they had little time to provide more detailed feedback, but as one focus group \nparticipant commented, students \u2018do not need essays of feedback, just a few good points \non how to improve\u2019. It has been also been recognised in previous studies (Duncan, 2007; \nHattie and Timperley, 2007) that a lack of identified areas for improvement in the feedback \nprovided, particularly in terms of approaches to the production of the work, means that students \nwill find it extremely difficult to \u2018feed-forward\u2019 to improve subsequent work. Some staff also \nacknowledged the inconsistency in feedback. This was identified as a particular problem by \nPersonal Tutors who receive carbon copies of the feedback sheets, when using the feedback \nto monitor progress of personal tutees. \nThe study reported here provides a comprehensive comparison of the perceptions of students \nand staff of the current feedback process on the biological science degree within the School \nBiological Sciences at University of Leicester. Our findings, which were in line with those of the \nNational Student Surveys (HEFCE, 2006), showed that biological science students expressed \nsome dissatisfaction with feedback received, in the main due to inconsistencies with written \nfeedback and a lack of management of student expectations. The apparent gulf between staff \nand student views of academic feedback and between students reported and considered views \nis explained by different perceptions. Students value personalisation in the feedback they \nreceive, and would like feedback to feel part of a relationship or partnership with staff rather \nthan an institutional process. A well defined feed-forward approach allowing staff to provide \ntargeted comments for improvement could be facilitated by staff being made aware of these \nfindings. In addition, students\u2019 dissatisfaction with the feedback cycle may be countered by \nadopting a formalised approach to their understanding of the utilisation of feedback. Increased \nuse of technology might also be able to help with processing times and personalisation of \nfeedback, matching expectations to the reality of the pressures in higher education.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the students and staff from the School of Biological Sciences \nfor their cooperation in this study.
