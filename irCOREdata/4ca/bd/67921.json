Introduction \nThe main aim of this paper is to explore the value of transdisciplinary dialogues for allowing the \nadvancement of critical perspectives on international business and work on transnational corporations \n(TNCs) in particular. Specifically, the paper considers how dialogues between two subsets of the broad \ngroups that I label economic geographers and organizational sociologists can advance understanding of \nTNCs as embedded social communities. \n \nThere have been a number of attempts to debate the importance and value of dialogue between \nscholars from the disciplines of geography and management studies (see for example Clark and Wrigley, \n1997; Coe and Wrigley, 2006; Palmer et al., 2006). At times this debate has been fractious, leading to \naccusations of overly critical reviews of one-another\u2019s work and claims that oversimplifications have led \nto the \u2018balkanizing\u2019 of one-another\u2019s research field. There have also been more general debates about \nthe nature and merits of transdisciplinary research. Here I use the term transdisciplinary to refer to a \ntype of research that is distinct from multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches. Specifically I \n3 \n \nfollow, amongst others, Weigngart and Stehr (2000) and Wickson et al. (2006) and define: \nmultidisciplinary approaches as research that involves teams from several disciplines who address the \nsame problem from their own perspectives through their own questions; interdisciplinary approaches as \nresearch that involves teams from multiple disciplines addressing a problem through a focus on \nquestions that overlap disciplines and create common interests; and transdisciplinary approaches as \ninvolving new questions which are inspired by existing research but that no discipline has previously \nasked or sought to answer and which do not exclusively fit with the theoretical concerns of one \ndiscipline.  In this sense, the question of how to understand TNCs as embedded social communities is a \ntransdisciplinary question that seeks to not simply conduct research in the overlapping spaces between \nthe disciplines of economic geography and organizational sociology but to generate new questions for \nresearch, methods and priorities through a coming together of representatives of both disciplines. \n \nThere are, however, inherent challenges that transdisciplinary research faces. Most fundamentally \ntheoretical allegiances and incompatibilities need to be put to one side to allow new questions to \nemerge and evolve. But at the same time the dangers of analytical dilution must be avoided and \nanalytical magnification through research ensured. Similarly, constructive critique rather than stagnant \nconsensus is vital and should not be lost in the name of transdisciplinary collaboration. However, \nwithout wanting to suggest these debates are unimportant, in this paper I want to circumvent more \nphilosophical discussions about the merits of transdisciplinary research (but see Weingart and Stehr \n[2000] on such issues) in order to take the first steps towards outlining how a pragmatic approach to \ntransdisciplinary research might allow geographers and management scholars to generate new \nquestions and insights about the way TNCs operate as embedded social communities.  \n \n4 \n \nIn referring to TNCs as embedded social communities I seek to draw attention to two distinguishing \nfeatures of management practice in cross-border organisations that have long troubled academics and \npractitioners alike. Embedded refers, following Polanyi (1944), to the way management and decision \nmaking in TNCs are influenced by geographically variable structures that shape cognitive, cultural, social \nand political logics. In particular, embedded refers to the way TNCs are always influenced by the \nstructures of their home and host countries. Social communities alludes to the fact that management in \nTNCs is a political exercise involving multiple social actors that through their interactions, conflicts, \nnegotiations and compromises determine the way a firm is governed and structured.  I do not claim the \nidea of TNCs as either embedded or as social communities is new \u2013 see for example the expression of \nelements of the concept in the work of, amongst others, Dicken (2000), Dicken et al. (2001), Ferner et al. \n(2005, 2006), Gertler (2004), Hess (2004), Jones (2005; 2007), Morgan (2001a; 2001b) and Yeung \n(2005a, 2005b). Instead, this paper\u2019s originality is the consideration offered of the value of such a \nframing for generating new research question about not embeddedness, not the micro politics of \nmanagement, not firm structure but about the dialectic causes and nature of management and social \nconflict in \u2018embedded social communities\u2019.  This is a subtle but important switch in emphasis that raises \na series of interesting and important questions that are likely to be missed when solely focussing on \nembeddedness or the micro politics of management.  \n \nBefore proceeding any further it is important that I acknowledge my particular positionality in relation \nto this issue. As part of my research on transnational law firms I have conducted research and written \npapers as part of a now established collaboration with Daniel Muzio, a member originally of Lancaster \nUniversity Management School and more recently Leeds University Business School (see for example the \nresearch reported in Faulconbridge and Muzio 2007, 2008, 2009). As such, and as a self badged \n5 \n \neconomic geographer, I am already wedded to the idea that collaboration between geographers and \nmanagement scholars brings benefits to critical studies of international business. Here I want to offer \nmy perspective on why such collaborations are important and fruitful and identify the type of advances \nsuch collaborations might generate when used to develop transdisciplinary approaches. \n \nThe rest of the paper is structured around two further sections. In the next section of the paper I \nconsider what a subset of scholars allied to the groupings that I broadly label as economic geography \nand organizational sociology bring to the study of TNCs. My main argument is that the two groups have \ndifferent but compatible strengths that when combined are well positioned to develop a number of \ncrucial new transdisciplinary questions about the activities of TNCs. The example used to support this \nargument relates to what I call questions of \u2018transnational identity regulation\u2019 and unites fertile studies \nof the role of identity regulation as a management strategy with studies of embedded TNCs to generate \nnew questions for study. The final section then reflects on the implications of the approach presented in \nthe paper for future collaborations across the geography- management \u2018divide\u2019. \n \n \n2. Synergism rather than scepticism: the value of pragmatic collaboration  \nIn an important intervention in this journal, Yeung (2005a) suggests that \u2018organizational space\u2019 \u2013 the \nstudy of how TNCs create and manipulate different types of social space to facilitate their operations \u2013 is \none way that geographers can enhance management scholars\u2019 understandings of international business. \nFor Yeung, such an approach acts as an alternative to quantitative studies of international business that \nview space as a \u2018container\u2019 and as a variable in equations that represent the locational decision making \n6 \n \nlogics of firms. This argument, that international business needs to be studied from a more sociological \npoint of view, which takes space and its social construction seriously, is an important one and is \nfundamental to geographers\u2019 understandings of TNCs (see also Beaverstock, 2004; Bunnell and Coe, \n2001; Currah and Wrigley, 2004; Faulconbridge, 2008a; Jones, 2005, 2007; Yeung, 2005b). However, \nhere I want to take a different approach to arguing for the importance of bringing geographers\u2019 \nperspectives into dialogue with management perspectives on international business. My approach seeks \nless to identify the shortcomings of existing research by management or geography scholars and more \nto identify complementarities that exist in the work of the two groups. After all, as Burell and Morgan \n(1979) long ago argued, there is often more progress to be made through dialogue with those who share \nthe same research paradigm and philosophy than there is through dialogue and critique across \nparadigms and philosophies. By developing a dialogue between the work of economic geographers and \nwhat I broadly label \u2018organizational sociologists\u2019 my aim is to talk within two related paradigms.   \n \n \n2.1 Economic geography: identifying the constitution of relational space in TNCs \nEconomic geography as a sub-discipline of geography covers a broad array of \u2018economic geographical\u2019 \nperspectives (Peck and Yeung, 2003). Much of the work by economic geographers would not lend itself \nto the type of transdisciplinary collaboration I want to promote here. For example, work on national and \nregional innovation systems (see Audretsch and Feldman, 1996; Edquist, 1997; Lundvall and Johnson, \n1994) that focuses almost exclusively on the role of institutional actors in defining the nature of a \nbusiness environment has much less to contribute to debates about TNCs as embedded social \ncommunities than the literature discussed below. It is, therefore, important to be clear about the claims \nI am making here about the research of economic geographers. I am suggesting that a subset of and not \n7 \n \nall economic geographical research, when coupled to a subset of and not all of organizational \nsociologists\u2019 research, might generate valuable transdisciplinary collaborations and questions. Indeed, in \nmany ways the subsets of research I discuss below are already interdisciplinary. Therefore, my \ncontribution is to consider ways of generating new lines of enquiry beyond the shared points of interest \nalready identified.  \n \nIn terms of economic geography, the body of work I am interested in here and which is most useful to \nstudies of international business places economic sociology at the heart of analyses of the geographies \nof TNCs (on which see Peck, 2005). This already interdisciplinary work seeks to analyse the embedded \nnature of international economic activity and the way social actors within firms construct spaces of \ninternational business. Drawing on the work of Polanyi (1944) and Granovetter (1985), embeddedness \nhas been used by economic geographers to capture the way all international business activities are \ngrounded in societal structures that influence the cognitive, cultural, social and political characteristics \nof a firm\u2019s managers and workers and ultimately the firm\u2019s operations. In particular, the role of \ngeographically variable institutions \u2013 defined as both formal rules and regulations and informal customs \nand norms following amongst others the work of Veblen (1919), Polanyi (1944), North (1990) and \nHodgson (2006) \u2013 in shaping the structure and profitability of TNCs has been noted. In the economic \ngeographical work I wish to draw on here this is referred to, following the intervention of Hess (2004), as \n\u2018societal embeddedness\u2019. Specifically, the societal embeddedness of TNCs \u2013 i.e. the cognitive, cultural, \nsocial and political influences on business practices - is said to result from the place a TNC emerges from \nand the place a TNC operates in.  The home-country leaves a distinguishing mark on the firm \u2013 thus for \nexample making English firms and their management practices distinctive from French firms \u2013 but at the \nsame time the unique features of host-country societies also influence and are influenced by \n8 \n \nmanagement practice in each subsidiary. Dicken (2000, 276) describes this idea with the phrase \u2019places \nproduce firms while firms produce places\u2019, the first part of the phrase alluding to the influence of home-\nand host-countries on TNCs\u2019 management practices and the second part the influence of TNCs on the \nhost-country. As a result of this societal embeddedness, TNCs are said to be constantly adapting and \nhybridising their management practices to take account of the influence of home- and host-country \ninstitutions on operations (see for example Coe and Lee, 2006; Faulconbridge 2008b; Wrigley et al., \n2005). \n \nIn addition, the subset of economic geographers who adopt an economic sociology inspired approach to \nstudying TNCs have also pointed to the role of what Hess (2004) calls \u2018network embeddedness\u2019. Similar \nto the ideas of Granovetter (1985), network embeddedness has been used to capture the way the \nexistence and social constitution of relationships between spatially distributed individuals operating in \nTNCs (e.g. branch managers in London, Singapore and Hong Kong) influence international business \nactivities.1 Specifically discussions of network embeddedness focus on:  \n\u201cthe network of actors a person or organization is involved in, i.e., the structure of relationships \namong a set of individuals and organizations regardless of their country of origin or local \nanchoring in particular places. It is most notably the 'architecture', durability and stability of \nthese relations, both formal and informal, which determines the actors' individual network \nembeddedness (the relational aspect of network embeddedness) as well as the structure and \n                                                             \n1 Hess also identifies the role of territorial embeddedness, which departs significantly from the work of Polanyi \n(1944) and Granovetter (1985) and highlights the anchors that tie a firm to a particular place, such as reliance on a \nlocalised client base. Debates about territorial embeddedness have, however, less relevance to the analysis here \nand are, therefore, excluded from the main discussion. \n9 \n \nevolution of the network as a whole (the structural aspect of network embeddedness) \u2026 \nNetwork embeddedness can be regarded as the product of a process of trust building between \nnetwork agents, which is important for successful and stable relationships. Even within intrafirm \nnetworks, where the relationships are structured by ownership integration and control, trust \nbetween the different firm units and the different stakeholders involved might be a crucial \nfactor\u201d (Hess, 2004, 177). \n \nThe simultaneous influence of both the societal and network embeddedness identified by Hess (2004) \nhas been shown by economic geographers to act as the basis for the production of relational space \nwithin TNCs. Management \u2018gets done\u2019 in this relational space as network embeddedness \u2013 spatial \nrelationships between managers and workers - is used to manage the influences of societal \nembeddedness. This management involves negotiations about how, and the extent to which, home-and \nhost-country societal influences shape the governance and structure of TNCs\u2019 subsidiaries. Hence, \naccording to Yeung (2005b, 38), a relational approach to studying globalization recognises the role of \n\u201crelational geometries which are neither actors (e.g. individuals and firms) nor structures (e.g. class, \npatriarchy and the state), but configurations of relations between and among them \u2013 connecting actors \nand structures through horizontal and vertical power relations\u201d. As such, a relational approach is \nsupposed to be descriptive of management practice in TNCs, mapping the existence of relations \nbetween different social actors, but also analytical, revealing the social processes, politics and \nnegotiations that characterise the type of spatial relationships involved in running a TNC. For Dicken et \nal. (2001), the relational space approach involves, therefore, three analytical steps. First the social actors \nand influences upon them need to be identified. Second, the socio-spatial relations between actors need \nto be characterised and studied. Third, the outcomes of these socio-spatial relations need to be charted \n10 \n \nand explained in the context of steps one and two. Step three also means unpacking the organizational \nstructure and strategy that emerges from socio-spatial relations and the politics of these relations.   \n \nAs such, geographers\u2019 unique contribution is to provide a way of analysing the complexities of the \nmanagement of TNCs that takes account of the influence of diverse societal contexts on day-to-day \nmanagement strategising and decision-making. By bringing together both an understanding of the \nnature of place-specific forms of societal embeddedness, and the way these influences get managed \nthrough network embeddedness, the messiness of the social life of TNCs comes into focus (Coe and \nYeung, 2001). For example, Currah and Wrigley (2004) show how transnational retailers such as Tesco \ngenerate transnational communities of practice through which both home-country defined best \npractices get disseminated to overseas stores but also the adaptation of best practices to host-country \ncontexts gets negotiated (e.g. when the home-country defined design of stores is seen as inappropriate \nin a particular country because of cultural norms relating to the role of supermarkets, the way they are \nused by shoppers and the services they provide). This negotiation involves compromises and inevitably \nclashes and corporate politics but also involves collaboration and learning as host-country norms \nrelating to retail are learned from and sometimes implemented in the home-country of the firm.  \n \nGertler (2004) similarly uses the tools of economic geography to show the role of home and host \ncountry institutions in shaping the nature of intra-firm relations \u2013  i.e. the way institutions influence the \ncustoms and norms that shape relationships between colleagues and between managers and workers as \nwell as ways of working, what Gertler (2004) calls industrial practices. Specifically, Gertler (2004) shows \nthrough a comparison of manufacturers in Germany and the USA that, to use the language of work on \nnational business systems (see Whitley, 1998), the different \u2018collaborative\u2019 and \u2018arm\u2019s length\u2019 \n11 \n \ninstitutional environments of the two countries produce workers and employers with different cultures \nrelating to training. In Germany institutions lead to cultures that promote training and lifelong learning \nfacilitated by the employing organisation because of the enforcement by institutions of long-term ties \nand collaboration between employers and employees. In contrast, in the USA the coordinating \ninstitutions do not promote such employer-employee relationships and result in employers having little \ndesire to train workers and workers themselves having only short-term commitment to a firm and hence \nno desire to complete training. As a result, German firms attempting to setup manufacturing operations \nin the USA have faced a great deal of resistance when attempting to implement home-country ways of \nworking in relation to training.  \n \nA case could be made, then, that economic geographers already have the tools to conceptualise the \nTNCs as embedded social communities, tools that can allow them to export ideas to other disciplines, \nsuch as management, as well as import them into economic geography (on which see Peck, 2005). \nGeographers are particularly well positioned to reveal how TNCs as social spaces of management are \naffected by societal embeddedness which in turn influences embedded network relations between \nmanagers and workers in the firm. Indeed, a number of geographers have, as part of a \u2018practice turn\u2019, \nused the insights generated by discussions of societal and network embeddedness as inspiration for the \ndevelopment of research that focuses on the day-to-day practices associated with managing the \nembedded international operations of firms (see for example Jones, 2005; Faulconbridge, 2008a, 2008b; \nHall and Appleyard, 2009; Murphy, 2006). However, despite their \u2018practice turn\u2019, what these (the \ncurrent author included) and other economic geographers are less adept at doing is revealing in detail \nthe actions and micro politics that operate on a day-to-day basis in TNCs. Yeung (2005b) has made this \ncritique before: whilst emphasising the politics of relational spaces, economic geographers have tended \n12 \n \nto be somewhat descriptive of the social tussles that define and are defined by these politics, identifying \ntheir occurrence but providing little in terms of micro-scale analysis of the way these tussles play-out on \na day-to-day basis (see also Sunley, 2009). This is where the work of organizational sociologists comes in. \n \n \n2.2 Organizational sociologists: revealing the day-to-day micro politics of business spaces \nThe body of research I refer to here as organizational sociology is broad in nature whilst all emerging \nfrom business\/management schools. The aim here is to identify the most useful sub-set of this \norganizational sociological work for generating transdisciplinary dialogues. Specifically, I want to \nemphasise the way the common interest of a sub-set of economic geographers and a sub-set of \norganizational sociologists in \u2018sociology\u2019- i.e. the social dynamics of management within organizations, \nthe way social actors strategise and respond to management and, relatedly, the social, political and \norganizational outcomes of management practices \u2013 can be used to foster collaborative work designed \nto advance understanding of TNCs as embedded social communities. As such, and like the review above \nof economic geographers\u2019 work, I am not claiming that the work of organizational sociologists has to \ndate ignored the benefits of interdisciplinary research; much of the existing work is highly \ninterdisciplinary and draws on insights from sociology, politics, law etc..  Nor am I claiming that it is only \nthe work I discuss below that can be used to frame transdisciplinary research about TNCs. Rather, I \nselectively draw on organizational sociologists\u2019 work to highlight how dialogue with the work of \neconomic geographers creates opportunities for the emergence of new transdisciplinary questions \nabout TNCs as embedded social communities. \n \n13 \n \nThe subset of the organizational sociology literature that I want to draw on here includes, first, research \nlabelled as \u2018critical management studies\u2019 which has developed over the past twenty years since the \npublication of the edited collection by Alvesson and Willmott (1992). More recently summarised in a \nreader edited by Grey and Willmott (2005) and a handbook edited by Alvesson et al. (2009), critical \nmanagement studies has grown to be a diverse field that, as Adler et al. (2007) highlight, uses left \nleaning theory to question the social but also ecological justice of management practices as diverse as \nteamwork (see Ezzamel and Willmott, 1998) and environmental management (Beder, 2002), \nfinancialised management (Froud et al., 2006) and expectations of emotional labour in the workplace \n(Bolton and Boyd, 2003). Second, I also include work that addresses similar concerns but which may or \nmay not sit squarely under the badge of critical management studies (see Ackroyd [2004] on what is and \nisn\u2019t critical management studies). This includes work on labour process theory that emphasises the role \nof conflict, resistance and misbehaviour in the workplace (Ackroyd and Thompson, 1999; Burawoy, \n1979; Thompson, 2003) as well as power more generally (Clegg et al., 2006; Clegg and Palmer, 1996; \nHardy, 1996). It also includes work on the firm as a community (of practice) (Adler et al., 2008; \nOrlikowski, 2002; Roberts, 2006; Swan and Scarborough, 2005), studies of the knowledge\/professional \nworker (Ackroyd and Muzio, 2007; Clegg and Clark, 1999; Fincham, 2006), studies of the role of gender \nand religion in the workplace (Bolton, 2005; Essers and Benschop, 2009), and work on strategy as \npractice (Jarzabkowski, 2004; Johnson et al., 2007).  \n \nThe work outlined above is, whilst broad, meant to capture the interest of a group of organizational \nsociologists in the sociology of the workplace. Some might disagree with the classification of the work as \na coherent body of scholarship. The main point I am making, though, is that this work and other work \nlike it prioritises in the study of organizations the study of people doing management and being \n14 \n \nmanaged, the influences on, and of, their actions and the outcomes in terms of organizational forms, \ncommercial successes and personal and collective social costs. As such it is not that far removed from \neconomic geographers\u2019 interest in the embedded TNC and, to paraphrase Yeung (2005b), the actors, \nstructures, power relations and outcomes associated with relational spaces. Moreover, in work badged \nas \u2018critical management studies\u2019 (see Alvesson et al., 2009; Grey and Willmott, 2005) the theoretical \ntools deployed, such as the work of Foucault , Goffman and Marx, mirror tools used by geographers (see \nfor example Larner, 2007, Jones, 2007, and Massey, 2004, respectively). Significantly though, the work \nof organizational sociologists does differ from that of economic geographers in one important way.  \n \nWith some exceptions, the work of the organizational sociologists I have highlighted above is primarily \nbased on studies of one site in a domestic firm or the study of one site within a TNC\u2019s network of \noperations. This single site focus is a key strength and is something economic geographers interested in \nTNCs can learn from. The detailed empirical analysis of the day-to-day micro politics provided by \norganizational sociologists offers a way of developing a richer understanding of the social interactions, \nstruggles, conflicts and contests that characterise the relational space that allows TNCs to operate. As a \nresult the work of organizational sociologists when combined with the strengths of economic \ngeographers has the potential to identify the nature and role of management practices as situated, \nrelationally constructed through interactions and based on language games and social tussles between \ndifferent actors in firms (Delbridge and Ezzamel, 2005).  \n \nA particularly useful way of exemplifying the potential complementarity of economic geographers\u2019 and a \nsub-set of organizational sociologists\u2019 work is by considering the way critical management studies of \nidentity regulation understand management practice. Such approaches, which have formed part of what \n15 \n \nhas been broadly defined as a post-structural turn in which both theory and methods are re-orientated \nto prioritise fine-grained social analysis of organizational practices (Watson, 2008), gives credence to the \nidea that the power of managers actually lies in their ability to change, through the actions of key \nindividuals and groups, identities and the perspectives of workers. Drawing on approaches which see \nidentity as the main influence on an individual\u2019s understanding of \u2018who I am\u2019 and \u2018how I should act\u2019 \n(Alvesson et al., 2008), and assuming that identity is constructed in an ongoing manner through social \ninteraction, linguistic exchange and conflicts and contestations between different individuals and groups \n(Cerulo, 1997), the concept of \u2018identity work\u2019 captures the way individuals are continuously forming and \nreforming their identity. The concept of \u2018identity regulation\u2019 captures the way managers, through \nstrategic actions and interactions, influence identity work processes (Alvesson and Willmott, 2002; \nSveningsson and Alvesson, 2003).  \n \nExemplifying the nature of identity regulation, Sveningsson and Alvesson (2003, 1167) reveal the role of \ndiscourse and language and how \u201ca more or less integrated, prefabricated line of using language and \nreasoning\u201d lies behind management attempts to change the way people work and behave. Alvesson and \nWillmott (2002) further reveal the role of language in (re)positioning workers\u2019 understandings of \u2018who I \nam\u2019 and \u2018how I should act\u2019 as part of management strategies. They outline nine different linguistic \nstrategies: \n1. Defining the person directly. The characteristics desired of the \u2018ideal employee\u2019 are explicitly \nstated. \n2. Defining a person by defining others. An individual or group is compared to others who \nrepresent \u2018ideal\u2019 employees. \n16 \n \n3. Providing a vocabulary of motives. A language is created to identify and help individuals make \nsense of who the ideal employee is and how they act. \n4. Explicating morals and values. Values are espoused, often via stories and by comparison to \nthose values deemed unacceptable, to help workers understand how the firm wants them to \nact. \n5. Knowledge and skills. Education and training is used to instill understanding of how an individual \nshould view themselves as an employee and how they should act. \n6. Group categorization and affiliation. Dividing up the world into \u2018us\u2019 and our identity and \u2018them\u2019 \nand their alterity. \n7. Hierarchical location. Praising individuals and groups that embody the identity of the firm\u2019s ideal \nemployee. \n8. Establishing and clarifying the rules of the game. Laying out the \u2018norms\u2019 of how things are done \nin an explicit fashion. \n9. Defining the context. Stating clearly the customs and norms of the firm and the expectations \nabout how workers align themselves with this context. \n \nSuch studies of identity regulation draw heavily on the work of Foucault (1980; 1991) to conceptualise \nlanguage and discourse as a governmental tool that shapes conduct. However, at the same time as \nlooking at the way managers use discourse to govern, organizational sociologists have also revealed, as \nBeech (2008, 56) puts it, that discursive strategies \u201ccan proceed in ways which have either centripetal or \ncentrifugal identity outcomes. The dialogue might lead to reinforcement of rejection of an identity \nconstruction, or to possible points in between these two extremes\u201d. It is, then, not just the tools \ndeployed in conflicts in firms that are revealed by organizational sociologists but also how individuals \n17 \n \nand groups can resist change and, as a result, how attempts to invoke change can fail or, rather than \nnecessarily leading to one group winning at the expense of another, lead to compromises and \nnegotiated settlements. Examples of how such subversion or corruption may be achieved include the \nproduction of alternative counter discursive regimes (Elsbach and Bhattacharya, 2001), the use of \ncynicism or irony as a way of questioning discursive regimes (Dent, 2003; Fleming and Spicer, 2003; \nKosmala and Herrbach, 2006) and the creation of what Goffman (1967) would call a \u2018front stage\u2019 in \nwhich cultures promoted by identity regulation are displayed to appease management and a \u2018back \nstage\u2019 in which alternative cultures are displayed as a form of resistance (Delmestri, 2006; Costas and \nFleming, 2009). Consequently, studies of identity regulation emphasise the importance of detailed, \noften ethnographic, studies of situated management practices. \n \n2.3 Transdisciplinary questions and new agendas \nSo what is the value in bringing the work of organizational sociologists on identity regulation into \ndialogue with economic geographers\u2019 work on institutions and TNCs and what are the wider lessons that \ncan be drawn from this about the value of transdisciplinary research?  The institutions economic \ngeographers have identified as being so important in shaping the activities of TNCs, through the customs \nand norms they help produce, in many ways shape an individual\u2019s understanding of \u2018who I am and how I \nshould act\u2019 as a worker. In TNCs, when actors at headquarters attempt to manage actors working in \noverseas subsidiaries, particularly when home-country best practices are rolled out in overseas \nsubsidiaries, conflicts emerge because amongst other things of the way the identities of workers and \nmanagers in each subsidiary \u2013 i.e. their understanding of who the firm\u2019s employees are and how they \nshould act \u2013 are produced by place-specific institutions that differ from the institutions of the home-\ncountry of the firm. As noted above, economic geographers have not been particularly proficient at \n18 \n \nstudying the micro-scale subtleties of the conflicts that emerge from such differences in identity. \nHowever, in highlighting the nature of the dialogue and interaction that goes on in firms as managers \nand workers come into conflict about identity, the work of organizational sociologists provides a starting \npoint for considering the nature of such institutionally inspired conflicts in TNCs. Thus collaborations \nbetween economic geographers and organizational sociologists might be said to be beneficial because \nthey could allow the development of research of transnational identity regulation and its role in TNCs \nwhich overcomes the limitations of economic geographers\u2019 work and also allow the internationalization \nof the work of the organizational sociologists studying identity regulation in non-global firms. But this is \nnot the only potential end result of dialogue between the two groups and is, indeed, an outcome that \ncould be critiqued because, inevitably, there will be individuals and sub-sets of the sub-sets of scholars I \nhave discussed here who have already embarked on such a journey.   \n \nThe development of a genuinely transdisciplinary approach means generating analytical traction that \nneither organizational sociologists nor economic geographers alone, or any other uni-, multi- or \ninterdisciplinary research grouping, could achieve through the development of new questions. A \ntransdisciplinary approach would be based on questions that focus on the dialectic relationships that \nmean, depending on the management tactics used  - with the choice of tactics and their success being \ninfluenced by the societal embeddedness of the actors involved - different and apparently messy, hard \nto categorize and contingent organizational forms will emerge. In particular, this involves revealing the \ndiversity of relations within TNCs and, rather than characterising relations within firms as universal and \nconsistent, recognising that relations vary depending on (a) the types of negotiations, power games and \ncompromises that play out in the firm, something related to (b) the spatial dynamics of a relationship \nand variations in the societal embeddedness of situated actors. Hence, a transdisciplinary understanding \n19 \n \nof the TNC as an embedded community means asking questions about stretched relational spaces that \ninvolve interactions between managers and workers in different countries in a way that recognizes the \ninsights economic geographers have provided into societal and network embeddedness. But, this must \nbe done without losing organizational sociologists\u2019 focus on questions about the detail of the power \nstrategies employed. Such questions might lead to new insights, framed by the idea that the TNC is an \nembedded community, addressing issues such as:  \n\uf0b7 What are the causes of organizational politics and workplace conflicts in embedded social \ncommunities? Such questions offer the opportunity to more clearly tease out the link between \nforms of societal embeddedness, different forms of workplace conflict, and the management, \nstructure and success or failure of TNCs.  \n\uf0b7 How do coalitions and fractures emerge and define organizational politics in embedded \ncommunities and what effect do these have on identity regulation (power) strategies? These \ntypes of questions will help reveal the way degrees of difference between embedded actors \nlead to more or less fractious relationships that require different types of negotiations between \ncontending parties. \n\uf0b7 What effect does the recourse to virtual versus embodied interactions in identity regulation \n(power) strategies have on the micro politics of interaction between contending parties and \nunder what circumstances is one mode of interaction chosen over another? Such questions will \ndraw attention to the very real effects on regulation strategies of spatially distributed \nmanagement and workers in TNCs. In particular, as an embedded community, the socio-\ntechnical architecture that produces the community and the way the embeddedness of actors \ndefines the structure of this architecture and its role in conflicts and their resolution will be \nbetter revealed.  \n20 \n \n \nThese questions are just exemplars of a wider range of questions that emerge from the types of \ntransdisciplinary collaborations being promoted here. Such approaches also open up a series of \nmethodological questions. Space prevents a detailed discussion of methodology here, but, suffice to say, \na diverse range of approaches, from questionnaire surveys through to ethnography and conversation \nanalysis need to be appropriated, triangulated and when necessary re-designed to deal with such \ntransdisciplinary questions. \n \nTo a certain extent and as already alluded to, some economic geographers and organizational \nsociologists have already begun to consider the type of transdisciplinary questions outlined above. \nThere already exists, for example, an impressive body of work that explicitly studies TNCs, the affects of \ntheir embeddedness  on management practices and the situated manifestations of this in the form of \nworkplace power relations such as those associated with identity regulation (see for example \nD\u00f6rrenb\u00e4cher and Gammelgaard, 2006, Ferner et al., 2005, 2006; Morgan, 2001a, 2001b). In particular, \nthis work effectively couples theories of power (Clegg et al., 2006) to the extensive literature on national \nbusiness systems (Whitley, 1998) and the varieties of capitalism (Hall and Soskice, 2001) to explore the \ncompromises and adjustments in management strategies that are needed to accommodate different \nworker norms, values and attitudes as a result of institutional legacies. Similarly Brown et al. (2006) \nshow how place can act as a tool for worker resistance to identity regulation when used as a way of \nconstructing shared counter-discourses (e.g. we do it like this in Italy) based on particular societal \nnorms, whilst Ferner et al. (2005) reveal how the power relations that underlie management in TNCs are \nintimately related to not just headquarters-subsidiary duals associated with differential power relations \nbut also to conflicts caused by different and institutionalized place-specific norms about management. \n21 \n \nSuch work exemplifies, then, how much progress can be made if dialogue between scholars emerging \nfrom very different disciplinary backgrounds is used to develop new questions for research. And this \nmeans not just confining dialogues to those between economic geographers and organizational \nsociologists. Dialogues between these groups and those from disciplines such as anthropology, history \nand law may be just as rewarding. And this points to why my bigger argument about the need for not \nonly studies of TNCs but also critical perspectives on international business more widely to value \ntransdisciplinary approaches to research is important: the new questions raised cut across and push \nforward a wide range of debates and lay the foundations for important future research. \n \nBefore ending it is, however, important to acknowledge that in bringing the work of scholars from \ndifferent disciplines into dialogue some caution does have to be exercised. In the case of economic \ngeographers and organizational sociologists issues exist, as Watson (2008) notes, in relation to the \nimportance of not allowing collaboration to compromise the rich empirical analyses that organizational \nsociologists are so good at developing. Such a compromise is something economic geographers have \nbeen perhaps too quick to make, something reflected in the differences in the methodologies of \neconomic geographers and organizational sociologists. The former tend to rely on semi-structured \ncorporate interviews as the main tools for getting to grips with how TNCs operate. The latter also use \ninterviews but usually alongside long term observational work that explains and is explained by the \nfindings of interviews. The different approach of organizational sociologists allows them to develop a \nmore nuanced understanding of how management happens in practice and of the micro-politics of such \nmanagement processes, suggesting economic geographers might have to be willing to adopt alternative \nmethodologies to maximize the value of dialogue with organizational sociologists.  From another \nperspective there is a danger that collaborations lead to research that is, as Granovetter (1985) warned, \n22 \n \n\u2018over-socialized\u2019. Ensuring the structures of societal embeddedness highlighted by geographers, which \ncoexist alongside network embeddedness, are not lost in discussions of micro politics is vital. After all, it \nis the interaction of the two that defines the relational spaces of management in TNCs. There is also the \ndanger that detailed analyses of micro politics have little to say about the wider implications of changes \nnegotiated as part of encounters between workers and managers, for the firm and for individuals. This \nmeans research should focus on systematic changes in the organization of the firm \u2013 or lack of them \u2013 \nthat result from interactions between managers and workers and not just the interactions themselves. \nThis is something economic geographers prioritize in their relational approach and should not be lost in \nany collaboration. What I am suggesting, then, is that transdisciplinary working has the potential to \nleverage detailed explanations  of the way TNCs operate that the approaches of single disciplinary \ngroupings on their own cannot, as long as collaborations do not lead to the weakening of the existing \nstrengths of each group\u2019s work.  \n \n \n3. Conclusions \n In this paper I have called for critical studies of international business to be based on transdisciplinary \ndialogue that allows the complexities of TNCs, as embedded social communities, to be unpicked through \nnew questions for research. Taking as my starting point the assertion that the management of TNCs is \nboth influenced by structure \u2013 in the form of embeddedness that influences the cognitive, cultural, \nsocial and political characteristics of a firm\u2019s workers - and agency - in the form of social interactions \nthat characterise management work in TNCs -, I have considered how the work of economic \ngeographers and organizational sociologists might complement each other to develop a more \nsophisticated analysis of TNCs as embedded social communities. The example of transnational identity \n23 \n \nregulation was used to substantiate this argument. However, other topics relating to the management \nof TNCs, such as issues surrounding knowledge, learning, innovation and entrepreneurship could equally \nbenefit from dialogues between economic geographers and organizational sociologists (see for example \nthe case made by Yeung, 2009).  \n \nAs such, the main contribution of this article is to highlight the need for critical studies of international \nbusiness to avoid blinkered approaches to studying TNCs and disciplinary silos that inevitably limit the \nanalytical traction available to researchers. Studying international business, and TNCs in particular, is an \nincredibly complex task and exploring what can be learned from others outside of one\u2019s own disciplinary \nframe and using this to reframe research questions seems essential in order to develop meaningful and \nsophisticated representations of the social life of management in firms. Here I have promoted a \npragmatic approach to such collaborations that involves working within paradigms and with researchers \nwith shared theoretical, epistemological and ontological frames of reference, if not a shared empirical \nfoci of analysis. This is not to say attempting to work across paradigms and critiquing other paradigms is \nnot productive. Rather my argument stems from reflections on an approach I have found to yield the \nmost analytical traction and generate the most interesting research questions (and occasionally \nanswers).  \n \nAs noted, there are dangers associated with the pragmatic transdisciplinary approach I have outlined \nhere. Theoretical incompatibilities, the need to avoid analytical dilution and ensure analytical \nmagnification, and the need to sustain constructive critique rather than stagnant consensus have to be \nwrestled with and born in mind at all times. As a result, I believe there is still an important place for \ndisciplinary debates which can act as the starting point for transdisciplinary dialogues, as long as it is \n24 \n \nrecognised that pragmatically there seems to be much to learn from collaborative approaches that cross \nwhat are, after all, socially constructed scholarly divides.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe pragmatic collaboration described here was put into practice thanks to ESRC grant RES-000-22-2957 \n(see http:\/\/www.lancs.ac.uk\/professions\/professional_ed\/).
