The appli-\ncation itself was sufficiently interesting to the students to be motivating. Once\nattracted into the online community, students began to share experience in a way that\nforwarded the aims of the module. This would be justification enough, but the difficult\nenvironment in which the tutorials operated made the exercise even more valuable.\nThis paper\u2019s purpose is to report experience gained from the exercise, for the guid-\nance of those considering similar activities. Lessons are drawn that could guide the\nmodification of the application and its use more successfully in future\nBackground\nAlthough the use of asynchronous online communication environments has been\nquite extensively researched, less has been written about synchronous environments.\n*School of Computing, Napier University, 10 Colinton Road, Edinburgh EH10, UK. \nEmail: malcolmrutter@ieee.org\n170 M. Rutter\nThese are distinctive in several ways. Wright et al. (2004), for example, writing\nregarding a web-based forum, report that students do not appear to use threads in a\nuseful way. It is the nature of the pooling of knowledge that contributions are often\nnot conveniently clustered into a topic thread. For this reason, non-threaded chat\nstructures have been adopted in some courses (including that described here). This\ndecision is not without its drawbacks; Pimintel et al. (2003) report a phenomenon\nthat they call \u2018co-text loss\u2019, concerning confusion about which statement relates to\nwhich thread. It is not obvious to a contributor that their statement could have mean-\ning in a number of possible contexts, and this causes ambiguity.\nAlthough synchronous environments are distinctive in several respects, there are\nalso a number of contextual issues that influence their success that they share with\nasynchronous environments. For example, although the idea of blended learning is\nnow widespread, this mostly considers mixing asynchronous web-based materials\nwith face-to-face teaching. The use of an online proximate community (Wright et al.,\n2004) within a tutorial is an idea not hitherto encountered.\nThe topic of alienation in large classes has also been well reported. Preston and\nShackelford (1998) observe that students may feel anonymous in large classes, where\ninstructors have difficulty in appreciating feedback. Among other methods, they have\nsuccessfully used newsgroups in order to get discussion and feedback on the module\nthey teach. A differing view is advanced by Kay (1998). Kay agrees that alienation in\nlarge classes can lead to lack of attention and ultimately attrition, but he advocates\nmore personal solutions, such as laboratory partners, group work and peer testing.\nInterestingly, he is pessimistic about electronic communication systems on the\ngrounds that much interpersonal communication is non-verbal, although such\nconcerns are less visible in contemporary literature on this topic.\nOne feature that many students find attractive is the ability to use a nickname and\nicon as a mask to hide one\u2019s true identity. Millen and Patterson (2003) argue that\naccountability encourages politeness and trust. They describe an online proximate\ncommunity with a policy that enforces \u2018legal name\u2019 identification of participants.\nFarkas et al. (2002) point out that there are circumstances when anonymity is desirable,\nthe reviewing of papers for example. They describe an \u2018electronic Editorial Board\u2019 in\nwhich users are accountable to a trusted mediator. Within this context, they are free\nto adopt multiple personas to other participants. In conventional online communities\na participant may be barred and yet log on later as another persona; however, barring\nin the Farkas community affects all of a participant\u2019s personas, present and future.\nBoth Farkas et al. (2002) and Preece (2000, p. 155) also comment that other partic-\nipants may infer links between multiple personas from linguistic style. Preece (2000,\np. 197) herself has a more optimistic view of anonymity: she acknowledges that\nanonymity does permit irresponsible behaviour and it does happen, but that usually\nit does not. Whereas in real life, she comments, the bystander effect may inhibit observ-\ners from helping a person in difficulties, online participants are more forthcoming.\nAnother recurrent issue in the literature concerns the role of moderation. Preece,\nfor example, commented (2000, p. 228) that online communities die if left to fend for\nthemselves. The long-term support of a community is often entrusted to one or more\nSynchronous communication in a learning environment 171\nmoderators (p. 229), and she outlines the numerous tasks that such a person may\ncarry out (Preece, 2000, p. 83). The importance of moderation is easy to establish.\nFor example, Light et al. (2000) report an online forum used as a seminar group. In\na paper that should be required reading for those using computer-mediated commu-\nnication, Light et al. describe an environment in which the participants had no prep-\naration or advice, nor was it moderated. It is a story of good students who unwittingly\nattracted painful criticism, of online vandalism by a pair of males who set out to insult\nparticipants and disrupt the forum, and of a community so socially damaged that it\nhad difficulty functioning usefully. The conclusions of the paper are that rules, advice\nand moderation are necessary and that, if necessary, disruptive students may be\nwarned or withdrawn.\nGiven these issues\u2014of communication, identity and moderation\u2014it is somewhat\nsurprising that a Rogerian (i.e. person-centred) approach to facilitation has not been\nmore widely studied (Mahoney & Baker, 2002). To address this gap, this paper\nexplores a case in which this approach was adopted. This experience will be analysed\nin order to assess the possibility of adopting this model to support teaching more\nwidely.\nThe case context: a Rogerian approach to tutorial support\nThe environment in which this study was conducted was a 500-seat computing\nfacility, designed for ease of administration. The difficulties experienced in trying to\nuse the facility for education are already documented (for example, Buckner &\nDavenport, 2002). The environment\u2019s acoustics make it difficult to communicate\nwith a group of students as a whole. Tutorial sessions are often invaded by students,\nsingly or in groups, seeking free machines to do other work. The approach adopted\nin the module under consideration (43 students) was to give the group printed sheets\nof tutorial work. Individual help was available on request.\nStudents were observed communicating with one another using Microsoft\nMessenger. It was felt that this medium could be incorporated into the educational\nexperience. Accordingly, students were offered a synchronous communication\napplication (chat room) to use during tutorials.\nThe chat facility was provided to try to establish a sense of group identity for those\non the module, independent of space. These were Scottish Credit and Qualifications\nFramework (SCQF) level nine direct entrants (the year prior to the honours year),\nand it was hoped to encourage a group spirit and a collaborative approach to learning.\nFinally, it was hoped to motivate the students, so as to increase attendance and partic-\nipation. Given the importance attributed to facilitation in the literature, a moderator\nwas provided for the online group.\nInformal discussions with colleagues had highlighted that students would not or\ncould not stick to a predetermined topic in online chat and forums. It was decided to\naccept this predicted anarchy and work with the students rather than against them.\nThis has strong parallels with the operation of therapeutic juvenile psychotherapy\ngroups. Foulkes and Anthony (1965, p. 210) state: \n172 M. Rutter\nDuring the early sessions, when the children discover the opportunity afforded them to\nexpress themselves, the level of noise can be considerable. Interpretations are apparently\n\u2018lost\u2019 within the maelstrom. Later, at quieter moments, they come back from the group,\nhaving been heard. Experience shows that little that the therapist says goes unperceived.\nThe aim of the module leader was to foster a learning community of the kind\ndescribed by Rogers (1967, chapter 15), in which the facilitator provides respect and\nencouragement and the students do the active learning. This way of interacting was\nfound to have encouraged both participation and the sharing of experience within\ntherapeutic contexts and has been advocated within traditional educational practice.\nThis case was considered to be worth studying because the problems of the\nenvironment were a feature of most tutorial work undertaken in the school, and\nbecause a solution of this kind would be a relatively cheap enhancement to the learn-\ning environment. The aims of the research, then, were to monitor and report on the\nsuccess or otherwise of the chat facility, to provide guidance in improving this as an\naid to learning and to offer guidelines to those attempting a similar approach.\nMethodology\nThe application on which the study was based was chosen from a number of available\nfree packages. It was chosen for its technical simplicity\u2014it used the PHP language,\nwhich was known to operate on the School\u2019s web server. Often a forum or a chat room\nwould use a database, such as MySQL; this application was even simpler, storing\ninput in a text file on the server. A non-threaded application was chosen.\nApart from informal discussions with individual students, two methods of monitor-\ning were chosen. The application offered the ability to print off the contents of the\nstored file, containing the last 150 utterances. This was analysed for content, record-\ning the quantity and topics of the student utterances. The second feedback method\nwas a questionnaire, administered to the students late in the module. The question-\nnaire allowed quantitative analysis, but also contained open-ended questions to\ncollect student ideas.\nFurther research methods were considered but not used. A comparison of module\nmarks with and without the chat facility, follow-up studies of the cohesiveness and\nsuccess of the cohort or even the routine module student satisfaction survey might\nhave demonstrated that the approach was superior or redundant. These routes were\nnot taken because of the variability of cohorts and the statistical noise on the data.\nTechnical provision\nThe chat package selected was a linear or unthreaded chat application, Simple Chat\n1.3 (Anonymous, 2004), as shown in figure 1. (The Simple Chat package is currently\navailable free as BlaB! lite 2.2.) It ran on the web site of the School of Computing,\nwhich was used as a repository for the rest of the module material. Before entry,\nstudents were asked to choose a nickname of eight characters or less; many chose to\nbase this on their own name. They were also offered a selection of identifying icons.\nSynchronous communication in a learning environment 173\nMale and female icons were available, but also ungendered cartoon characters. A\nfeature of the application was a side panel showing the nicknames and icons of all\nstudents online at the time. If not erased, the file system would store only the last 150\ninputs. Experience showed that this represented almost two hours of operation.\nFigure 1. Screen shot of the chat application. The bottom frame is for composing messages. The top frame shows the ongoing dialogue. The column on the right shows who is online at the moment. Note the icons, some of which imply genderThe chat room was manned during tutorials. Initially the module leader ran it, but\neventually a student, employed as a demonstrator, asked if she could take over. She\nwelcomed students as they came online, took part in the chat and offered advice and\nencouragement where appropriate. The (mostly male) students commented that they\nwere more comfortable with a female than a male.\nResults\nThe chat room was active throughout most of the two-hour tutorial. Between 4 and\n15 of the 43 students on the module used the facility at any one time. It appeared that\nFigure 1. Screen shot of the chat application. The bottom frame is for composing messages.

Rutter\nthe success of the application had a circular effect, the large number of users attract-\ning even more. One student commented in class that she had visited the chat room\nout of hours but was disappointed to find herself alone. (The application had also\nbeen left running experimentally over the summer and during this time only one\nperson, from somewhere on the Internet, had left a message to say he\/she had visited.)\nDiscussion was mostly frivolous, covering diverse topics such as books read, films\nseen and good places to dance on the weekend. There was also surreal input.\nStudents coped with the linear nature of the presentation by holding multithreaded\nconversations anyway. At any one time there could be as many as three independent\nconversations interleaved with one another. It was believed that the frivolous chatter\nwas a way of claiming the medium and establishing a level of trust. Among the banter,\nthere was space for students to discuss the module. Some shared their successes,\nsupplying the URLs of their web sites. Some asked about problems with the formal\ntutorial exercises (running in parallel as the \u2018main\u2019 work). There were queries about\nthe wording of the assignment specification. Some asked for help with technical diffi-\nculties with their web sites\u2014they said they would rather ask online than raise their\nhands to ask for help from a physical demonstrator. One student, on seeing some of\nthe very successful web sites, confided his feelings of inadequacy and received reas-\nsurance from the moderator.\nIn the first week, while the group was getting used to the environment, some of the\ninternational students posted messages in French and in Spanish. One of those\nmessages contained a mild swear word. Following that, the whole group settled down\nto communication in English. Expletives were confined to the \u2018sh \u2026 t\u2019 forms accept-\nable in everyday journalism.\nIt was possible for a student to miss the tutorial through illness but nevertheless log\non from home. This was observed once in week nine.\nAnalysis of transcripts\nThe software discarded all but the last 150 utterances in the chat room. The students\nhad not discovered how to make long statements as one utterance, so one statement\ncould go on over a number of utterances.\nThe total number of utterances recorded over 10 weeks was 1224. Times were\nrecorded automatically, allowing the calculation of an average of 94.2 utterances per\nhour. This varied from the record rate of 250 utterances per hour of the first week to\nthe low 47 utterances per hour on the week the first assignment was due in.\nThe transcripts were read and common themes noted. Then they were analysed to\nmeasure how frequently these topics cropped up, and in what patterns (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. The frequencies of utterance of topics throughout the moduleThe most important question for the module leader was \u2018how often did the\nstudents share ideas about the module\u2019 (Figure 3)? Three hundred and twenty-one\nutterances were counted, averaging 26% of the total. There was a peak at 47% the\nweek the students got their web servers to work, which was a tricky operation.\nAnother peak came in week eight when the students were struggling to programme in\nXHTML. The actual number of utterances was lower, possibly because attention was\nSynchronous communication in a learning environment 175\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\nThis module\nFood\nOther modules\nPrevious web work\nComputing\nRunning joke\nD\nis\ncu\nss\nio\nn \nto\npi\nc\nUtterances throughout module\nFigure 2.

The highest peak of 81% resulted from a tutorial examining bad practice in web\ndesign, as students reported their finds.\nFigure 3. Percentage of utterances relevant to the module, versus week numberApart from discussion of the work of the course and the module, less than 2% of\nall the utterances were about the general topic of computing. There was, for instance,\na discussion about the wisdom of installing a particular operating system upgrade.\nAnother topic was that of university assignments not related to this module.\nNormally this topic remained at 7% of the utterances, although there was a surge\nin week nine when a student reported printing problems and others offered advice\nand support (41% of utterances that week were classified as being about \u2018other\ncoursework\u2019).\nSocial statements were considered significant, in that they were a measure of the\ncohesiveness of the group. These ranged from simple greetings when a new member\ncame online to detailed instructions about how to find a karaoke night. Social activity\nalso overlapped other activities, such as when students asked for and offered advice.\nMost utterances were to the moderator or to the group in general. A smaller but\nsignificant number of statements were made between individual students.\nAt the start of the module, some students showed the online group previous web\nwork that they had done and discussed it with the others. These discussions\naccounted for 50 utterances. One surreal running joke ran over five weeks, account-\ning for 20 utterances. The introduction of this topic may have been symbolic of the\nstudents owning and accepting the chat facility as theirs to use as they wished.\nFinally, the topic of food was very important to the students. The tutorial had been\ntimed to run up until lunchtime (11:00\u201313:00). Of all the utterances recorded\nthroughout the module, more than 11% were about food.\nAnalysis of questionnaires\nA questionnaire was administered to students and the results collated (Appendix 1).\nSeventeen students responded.\nFourteen students had logged in to the chat facility at one time or another. Those\nthat had not, said that they had awarded it a low priority compared with the module\nassignment and official tutorial work. Tolmie and Boyle (2000) and Salmon (2002)\nmaintain that students will only use online tools when there is a good reason to do so.\nSix students had logged in but not contributed. Unlike those lurking in a forum or\nnewsgroup, their presence would have shown on everyone\u2019s screen. This would have\nearned them a welcoming greeting from the moderator. The lurkers gave various\nreasons for non-contribution. Most said that they had had nothing to say. An inter-\nnational student reckoned that his English was too slow to cope with the pace of the\ndiscussion. One student confided that he was afraid of being laughed at by the others.\nLight et al. (1997) pointed out that the fear of revealing one\u2019s opinions for scrutiny\nwould discourage active participation.\nMost (four of six) of the lurkers reported benefiting from sharing the experiences\nof those who contributed. One said that seeing others sharing difficulties helped his\nSynchronous communication in a learning environment 177\nown feelings of inadequacy. Light et al. (1997) and Wilson and Whitelock (1998)\nhave reported the benefit of this vicarious form of learning.\nMany of those who had contributed online commented on the good atmosphere\nand friendly conversation. One-half of the contributors had used the chat room to ask\nfor information. Benefits reported started at a factual level (\u2018how to upload a web\nsite\u2019) but went on to meta-levels (\u2018I knew I only needed to ask for help\u2019). There was\nat least one example of learning a soft skill: \nI have learned that taking the time to ask when you are stuck is better than not asking \u2026\nand the chat is anonymous so there is more confidence gained if you are not articulate in\nasking face-to-face questions.\nAsked to comment on what social gains they may have made, there were three\ntypes of answer. Some said that there were no perceivable social benefits. Some\nsaid they had focused on using the facility for functional, factual purposes. A third\ngroup said they had been drawn in, in search of facts, but had thereby got to know\nothers.\nThe module leader was concerned whether the anonymity implied by the use of\nnicknames helped or hindered. A minority (2 of 12) said they would have\npreferred to know to whom they were talking. Most (9 of 12) wanted to keep the\nnicknames. Some said nicknames were fun. Others said that they helped with\nshyness in the early stages; if a student asked a silly question, their anonymity\nwould protect them. One commented that eventually everyone got to know who\neveryone else was anyway\u2014the anonymity had acted as a crutch only in the early\nweeks.\nStudents were asked whether the chat room was worth keeping in future deliveries\nof the module. Everyone who responded to that question answered in the affirmative.\nReasons given were that it integrated the class, was fun and gave quick access to\ninformation.\nCounter-examples\nNot everyone shared the enthusiasm for chat rooms. Those who had not used a chat\nroom pointed out that it was not assessed and that it was not an official part of the\nmodule. One commented that a lot of the chat was trivial light conversation. Another\nsaid she had used it in the first week, because that was a tutorial exercise, but never\nsince. A user said that he had never learned anything of relevance from the facility,\nwhile quite a few said they did not regard it as socially useful.\nSome students were observed to be using the MSN Messenger application instead.\nThey explained that they had formed a study group of their own. They regarded the\nchat facility as purely for the Web Design module, whereas they used Messenger for\nthe whole programme of study. Furthermore, Messenger could be ignored until a\ncolleague had something to say, when a message would appear in the system tray; the\nchat application only gave an audible warning, and sound was always turned off in the\nlaboratories.\n178 M. Rutter\nProblems\nThe module is delivered every semester. An incident occurred in a later delivery to\nsecond-year students: in one tutorial group, in week one, two students maintained a\nlong interaction, insulting each other in an obscene way. The demonstrator asked that\nthey would stop, both online and by calling out to the group, but they did not. The\nmodule leader interpreted this as a combination of the excitement that grips many\nstudents when encountering chat for the first time and the \u2018flame effect\u2019, in which\nusers are led to express anger very forcefully (Preece, 2000, p. 83). This presented a\nphilosophical challenge: demonstrations of power by the lecturer would have been\ncounter-productive, since the aim was to encourage and empower the students. The\nmodule leader took the opportunity of the next lecture to explain to all the students\nthat the chat room was intended for them to use, but that he himself faced constraints.\nThere was a risk that he might be asked to remove the application.\nThe costs of this facility are also an issue. The chat facility will not work well with-\nout a facilitator, costing \u00a38.80 per hour. For the whole 13-week module this works\nout to \u00a34.40 per student. It should be noted that only a subset of students seemed to\nbenefit from this, since styles differ and not every student uses the facility.\nDiscussion\nOne view of a university\u2019s role is that of inculcating generic transferable skills that will\nstay with the students for the rest of their lives (Brass & Pilven, 1999). Thus a\nprogramme in computing will serve to teach generic skills against a background of\ncomputing. In this context, a Rogerian approach should develop self-awareness and\na Rogerian perspective in participants. One of the most important skills learned was\nthat of sharing problems with others and the good feelings that come from helping\ncolleagues. It is hoped that this will encourage mutual support and the enrichment of\nthe learning environment, leading in turn to better learning. Another advantage is that\nboth online chat and a Rogerian approach are very attractive to students; this extra\nmotivation would serve to increase work input.\nAs a result of experiences with the chat room application, it was decided to\ncontinue to use it for future delivery of the module. The question of justifying this\ndecision is a challenging one, however. It is possible to address the problem of\nmeasuring the effectiveness of education, to see whether value for money is being\nobtained. Certainly, it was the experience of Halfpenny and Wellings (2001) that\nvirtual seminars do not reduce the resources needed in education, since they augment\nrather than replace the existing systems. If this is so, it may be more appropriate to\nexplore changes in the quality of the student experience and resulting mindset\ntowards education.\nThe module in question is franchised internationally, but the system would need to\nbe rethought before using it on large cohorts in parallel. It does not appear to be scale-\nable in its present form. However, the advantage of an Internet-based facility is that\nthe person moderating it does not need to be in the same physical location. They\nSynchronous communication in a learning environment 179\ncould be at an office desk or on a different site. Time zones permitting, one institution\ncould host tutorials for partner colleges throughout the world.\nThe observation of the parallel use of MSN Messenger should not have been a\nsurprise\u2014its use is common throughout the facility. If experiences of chat have\nencouraged students to form online study groups, then this has to be an enhancement\nof the educational experience. Previous experiences of (offline) spontaneous study\ngroups have shown that they are well be worth fostering. The module leader must\nnow consider whether Messenger is a more appropriate application to adopt.\nSometimes the most important outcome of a piece of research is the refining of the\nquestions to be addressed (Baskerville, 1999). One such question concerns the use of\nnicknames. These were intended to release inhibitions and encourage a greater free-\ndom. The anonymity they provide might prevent the growth of real relationships\nthrough this medium. One student even went so far as to collect a table matching\nnames to nicknames, either through curiosity or a deeper need.\nThe importance of a moderator cannot be overemphasised. It is the job of the\nmoderator to take the reticence or enthusiasm of the students\u2019 first encounter with\nthe chat room and maintain the warmth and interest. Rogerians speak of uncondi-\ntional positive regard and illuminating the humanity of the input of participants. A\nmore pragmatic magnet is the use of the moderator as a source of advice on the ongo-\ning work of the module.\nThere was a powerful response in week nine, when a student reported difficulties\nin printing a document. This is evidence that a group identity had formed, as one\nwould expect with groups that meet and share. What is not so certain is the chat\nroom\u2019s contribution to this identity.\nThe policing of a chat room is a delicate subject. Preece (2000, p. 95) comments\nthat communities can die under a deluge of flaming and spam, but that a long list of\nrules is very discouraging. At the moment, the chat room is completely unprotected;\nin theory, anyone with Internet access can maliciously disrupt communications. The\nfact that this has only happened once does not guarantee that it will not become a\nproblem; indeed, it suggests that it will recur. Technology can help, although it may\nnot be a complete answer. Firstly, there are parts of the university network into which\nstudents need to log in. Students could keep their online anonymity, as long as they\nwere also accountable. This might deter mischief. A common solution in many chat\nrooms is for the moderator, in the last resort, to be able to exclude (\u2018boot\u2019) a user with\na certain IP address. Swear-word detection and removal is another common feature\nin chat room software (on one site, detected swear words are automatically replaced\nwith the names of fruit and vegetables).\nConclusions\nThe research aim was to monitor the project, to determine how it could be improved\nand to provide guidance for others to follow a similar approach. These research aims\nwere met in so far as qualitative evidence was gathered that indicated some students\nwere benefiting educationally and there was some evidence for the social skills of the\n180 M. Rutter\ngroup having developed. It was not found possible to quantitatively determine the\nprofitability of the medium. Support, both online and in class, was found to be essen-\ntial to the success of the exercise.\nFor others following this route, the trade-off between anonymity and accountability\nneeds to be thought out carefully beforehand. The lack of security in the simple appli-\ncation allowed misuse to occur; indeed, in any application, misuse will certainly occur\nas the students test and experience the new medium. Technology can help a little, in\nthe provision of restricted access, accountability, temporary barring and the auto-\nmatic removal of untoward words, but it is only part of the answer. There is evidence\nfor the importance of the support given both online and in class. It was hoped that\nfostering a spirit of collaboration in the students might encourage a more successful\napproach to learning. In fact, the Rogerian philosophy adopted towards the manage-\nment of the application is believed to have contributed to its popularity and success.\nA fertile environment was produced, developing student input and a positive interac-\ntion between group members, which may enhance future learning.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author welcomes the opportunity to thank Simone Berg, who proved a most\nexcellent moderator to the chat facility.
