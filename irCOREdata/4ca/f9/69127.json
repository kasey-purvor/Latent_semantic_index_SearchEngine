Drawing upon recent work on the retrenchment of welfare\nbenefits and services this paper examines the context for the changes, the marketisation\nof the job placement services for ESA claimants and the extension of conditionality to sick\nand disabled benefit claimants. The paper argues that the introduction of ESA is a good\nexample of the retrenchment of benefits for the majority of sick and disabled people. The\npaper concludes that ESA can be interpreted as creating a group of disadvantaged people\nthrough which the private sector can profit.\nI n t roduct ion\nIn the UK from October 2008, new claimants of income replacement benefits for sick\nand disabled people have to claim Employment Support Allowance (ESA) rather than\nincapacity benefit (IB). The ESA is a central element in the government\u2019s drive towards\nan employment rate of 80 per cent. If this target is to be reached, one million people\nreceiving IB are going to have to find work in addition to a million older people and\n300,000 lone mothers (DWP, 2006). Although only announced in 2006 (Secretary of\nState for Work and Pensions, 2006), the ESA has been the subject of several papers. Some\n(Puttick, 2007; Messere and Stenger, 2007) are mainly descriptive, outlining the changes\nthat ESA will introduce, while others (Grover and Piggott, 2007) have taken a critical\napproach focusing upon the economic context of its introduction, the (medical) model of\ndisability upon which it is premised and on its gender implications.\nWhat these papers do not do is discuss to any great extent the relationships between\nthe ESA and IB. While Grover and Piggott (2007) do highlight the introduction of an\nempirically unsound analysis of what are held to be problems with IB, analytically we\nsay little about how the ESA will differ from IB and the implications of this for sick and\ndisabled claimants. This paper focuses upon such issues and discusses them within an\nanalytical framework that draws upon the concept of retrenchment. The paper argues that\nthe introduction of ESA represents an example of the retrenchment of benefit policy for\nthe majority of sick and disabled people who claim it.\nRet rench ing we l fa re\nHacker (2004) argues that the antecedents of recent academic interest in welfare reform\ncan be traced to Pierson\u2019s (1994) book,Dismantling theWelfare State. In that book Pierson\n159\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 16 Nov 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nLinda Piggott and Chris Grover\nargues that, while there have been various pressures \u2013 economic, political and social \u2013\nto roll back welfare provision, the provision in the USA and the UK has been resilient\nagainst such moves. Such arguments, Hacker (2004: 243) claims, have come to embody\nthe \u2018conventional\u2019 view that, while \u2018welfare states are under strain, cuts have occurred,\nbut social policy frameworks remain secure, anchored by their enduring popularity,\ntheir powerful constituencies, and their centrality within the post-war [World War II]\norder\u2019.\nThe difficulty with such arguments is that they seem to lean towards an ahistoricism by\nemphasising continuity at the expense of change, for, as the case of the UK demonstrates,\nwhile spending on social welfare programmes has increased over the past 30 years,\nimplying at an aggregate level that retrenchment has not occurred, the welfare state is now\na very different thing to that which it was three decades ago. This is particularly the case\nin relation to income maintenance policies; there are more people now reliant upon state\nbenefits for part or all of their income than there were 30 years ago and, to some degree,\nthere has been a shift from benefits for \u2018wage replacement to wage supplement\u2019 (Millar,\n2003: 123). In this context, the problem for the retrenchment thesis is that aggregate\ndata on spending disguise shifts in welfare programmes that, when analysed individually,\nmay well demonstrate a tendency towards retrenchment (Hay, 2005). Pierson (2006: 351)\npoints to this when he argues that there need to be qualitative analyses, as well quantitative\nanalyses of retrenchment, the former of which might include a focus on:\n(1) significant increases in reliance onmeans-tested benefits; (2) major transfers of responsibility\nto the private sector; and (3) dramatic changes in benefit and eligibility that signal a qualitative\nreform of a particular programme.\nThis would seem to be a fruitful approach to examining the complexities and nuances\nof changes in welfare states, for it points to various measures that can be employed to\nanalyse whether welfare benefits and services are being retrenched. However, his obser-\nvations are still at the level of the welfare state in general. An evenmore fruitful approach is\narguably one that follows Kemp (2000: 264) who suggests \u2018important insights into welfare\nstate retrenchment can be gained by disaggregating the analysis to look at individual\nwelfare programmes\u2019. This paper follows Kemp\u2019s suggestion by focusing upon income\nreplacement benefits for sick and disabled people and examining the ways in which the\nESA differs from the existing IB in terms of its eligibility criteria and its enforcement.\nAt the same time, as Pierson (1994: 15) argues in his thinking on \u2018systemic\nretrenchment\u2019, it is not enough to focus upon programme specific changes to understand\nretrenchment, for such programmes \u2018do not exist in a vacuum\u2019, but within a political\neconomic environment that involves a range of institutions and actors (Scarbrough, 2000).\nIn this sense, Pierson (1994) maintains that systemic retrenchment can take the form of:\n\u2018defunding\u2019 welfare states (or, one presumes, particular welfare programmes), attempts to\nchange public opinion through policy changes that reduce popular attachments to public\nwelfare provision, modifications in political institutions that change the ways in which\ndecision making about the welfare state is executed and a \u2018weakening of pro-welfare state\ninterest groups\u2019 (ibid.: 17).\nSystemic retrenchment, therefore, is concerned with the wider political economy\nof the welfare states and programmes, with how they come to be shaped by various\n160\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 16 Nov 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nRetrenching Incapacity Benefit\npolitical pressures and how these require managing if retrenchment is to be successful.\nThe implication of the existing analyses though, is that the political pressures from interest\ngroups are essentially \u2018pro-welfare\u2019; they aim to defend welfare provision or even demand\nthe extension of programmes. In our case, for example, the demands of the Disability\nRights Commission (now part of the Equality andHuman Rights Commission) for increased\nwork opportunities for disabled people is a good example. The problem, however, for\nexisting analyses is that such demands can be co-opted in a manner that can be used\nto shape policies around the retrenchment of welfare benefits and services. Moreover, it\nis not the case that pressures for change are always in defence of welfare; pressures, for\ninstance, from right-of-centre think tanks, such as the Institute of Economic Affairs and\nCentre for Policy Studies, helped to change the nature and direction of welfare provision\nin the 1980s and 1990s (see Cockett, 1995).\nThe concept of systemic retrenchment implies that there is a need to focus upon the\nwider context in which retrenchment occurs, particularly in relation to popular attitudes\ntowards welfare, and that this is as important a part of retrenchment as the actual changes\nto policies. Indeed, without an attempt to engage with such attitudes, retrenchment is\narguably very difficult. We turn to this issue in following section.\nI ncapac i t y benefit : the med ia and the d idac t ics o f the \u2018sc roungerphob ia \u2019\nThe number of people of working age who are claiming sickness-related benefits has\nbeen a concern to both Conservative and Labour governments over the past two decades.\nThe reason, for example, that Invalidity Benefit and Severe Disablement Allowance were\nreplaced by IB was to reduce the number of people claiming them by introducing a single\nbenefit with more restrictive qualifying criteria (McKeever, 2000). Since the election\nof New Labour in 1997 there has been a particular concern with IB. This was made\nclear when in 1997 a document outlining plans for changes to sickness and disability-\nrelated benefits was obtained by Channel 4 News and reported in the national press. The\ndocument noted:\nThe Government has made clear its aim to release resources from social security in order\nto spend more on health and education, and it is likely that a high proportion of the\nnecessary savings will have to come from benefits paid to sick and disabled people, including\ncompensation benefits for industrial injuries, which accounts for a quarter of all benefit\nspending. (The Guardian, 13 December 1997)\nThe release of such plans into the public domain came at an unfortunate time for\nNew Labour because the press was already concerned \u2013 expressed in headlines such\nas \u2018Blair accused as benefits for disabled are cut\u2019 (Mail on Sunday, 7 December 1997)\n\u2013 with the operation of the Benefits Integrity Project, which was introduced in the last\ndays of the Conservative government as a means of weeding out those people who were\nreceiving Disability Living Allowance and who could be administratively categorised as\nundeserving of it.\nThe content of the leaked document demonstrates some of the complexities of\nanalysing welfare retrenchment, for while it suggests retrenchment in benefits for disabled\npeople, this was for the purpose of the expansion of other more popularly supported state\nservices \u2013 health and education (Kemp, 2000). However, the aftermath of the leaking\n161\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 16 Nov 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nLinda Piggott and Chris Grover\nof the report also says something important about how welfare restructuring operates\nat a political and popular level, for its leaking \u2018led to protests from pressure groups for\ndisabled people and others representing the interests of social security claimants\u2019 (ibid. :\n267). For example, as Kemp (ibid.) notes, the public \u2018had considerable sympathy for sick\nand disabled people, who did not appear responsible for their situation\u2019. While the media\nare capable of taking both sides in any argument, the problem here for the government\nwas the need to make a convincing case for reforms.\nIt is difficult for retrenchment to take place in an atmosphere of public support\nfor state-sponsored welfare benefit services and\/or strong support groups of claimants\n(cf. Kemp, 2000; Scarbrough, 2000). \u2018Able-bodied\u2019 unemployed people have for many\nyears been the target of media campaigns that are directed at the structure and direction\nof welfare policies. Golding and Middleton (1982: 109), for instance, argue that the\nreporting of welfare-related issues, particularly a discourse related to \u2018scroungerphobia\u2019,\nwas in the 1970s part of the process of \u2018dismantling the welfare consensus\u2019. Moreover,\nit was part of an attempt \u2018to remoralise the workless millions to ensure the continued\nvitality of the work ethic and the preservation of law and order\u2019 (ibid.). Ginsburg (1979:\n48) argues that such discourses have such a role by \u2018rendering claimants socially as well\nas economically less eligible\u2019 (Ginsburg, 1979: 48).\nWithout a discourse vilifying sick and disabled claimants, it was difficult in 1997\nfor the government to \u2018construct a \u201cconvincing story\u201d to justify large-scale cuts in social\nsecurity and it was forced to acknowledge the political realities of welfare state roll back\u2019\n(Kemp, 2000: 267). However, the government arguably learnt a valuable lesson: that\ncommunication strategies involving the media were important in dealing with welfare re-\nform. Such observations were emphasised in the Green Paper, Beating Fraud is Everyone\u2019s\nBusiness: Securing the Future (Department of Social Security, 1998), where it was argued\nthat \u2018an anti-fraud culture among staff and the public and to deter fraud\u2019 (ibid.: para. 3.6)\nneeded to be developed. To do this it was noted that a \u2018public communication strategy\u2019\nwas necessary. This strategy included several high profile anti-fraud advertising campaigns\n(Raftopoulou, 2004; Grover, 2005; Connor, 2007). Our contention is that while, of course,\nthere could not be an advertising campaign justifying a decrease in the social eligibility\nof sick and disabled claimants there have, nonetheless, been attempts to cast out sick and\ndisabled claimants as being part of the alleged \u2018scroungerphobia\u2019 problem.\nIn 2006, for instance, Labour published the Green Paper, A New Deal for Welfare:\nEmpowering People to Work (Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, 2006), which,\nwhile not being exclusively concerned with sick and disabled claimants, was particularly\nconcerned with the way in which IB was held to attract \u2018too many people on to it and then\n[trap] them there once they claim it\u2019 (Grover and Piggott, 2007: 735). By coincidence\nthe Green Paper was published on the day the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)\naired the first programme in a series entitled On the Fiddle. This programme \u2013 and the\nothers that followed it \u2013 attempted to distinguish the deserving from the undeserving sick\nand disabled poor, for while it featured \u2018genuine\u2019 claimants, the processes they had to\nendure to claim disability-related benefits and the financial struggle that living on such\nbenefits often posed, it was primarily concerned with people who were claiming IB, but\nwho were, as the use of the video footage shot by fraud investigators showed, able to do\nat least some work.\nIn a second example the agenda was set by a range of headlines, including \u2018Too fat\nto work\u2019 (The Times, 19 November, 2007) and \u2018Tiredness among 480 reasons people give\n162\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 16 Nov 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nRetrenching Incapacity Benefit\nfor being unable to work\u2019 (The Guardian, 19 November 2007). Using statistics The Times\nclaimed to have gleaned from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) through\nthe Freedom of Information Act, such press reports focused upon claimants receiving\nbenefits for disabilities reportedly caused by obesity, acne and dizziness. In press stories\nthe then Secretary of State for Work Pensions was reported as saying \u2018No-one is entitled\nto incapacity benefit on the basis of a diagnosis\u2019 (The Times, 19 November 2007), later in\nthe day the DWP issued a press release that, in many ways, reflected the media\u2019s concerns\nabout disability benefits, but which could also use the press to justify the announcement\nof \u2018a new medical test that will score a person\u2019s capability to work . . . as part of [the] drive\nto end sick-note Britain\u2019 (DWP, 2007a: 1). In particular, the press release noted that one\nhalf of those taking the test would fail it, \u2018meaning that 20,000 fewer people a year will\nenter \u201csickness\u201d benefits\u2019 (ibid.). By the end of the day the press and the government were\nmetaphorically singing from the same song sheet; IB claimants were benefit-dependent\nbecause of their inadequacies rather than because of a range of disabling barriers that\nthey face in accessing paid work. The focus upon individuals and their responsibilities\nas citizens was being used to justify retrenchment in benefits for sick and disabled\npeople.\nThe harmonising of media and government arguments have, since the debacle\nrelated to disability benefits in 1997, been crucial in constructing a popular environment\nconducive to the restructuring of IB. The work of Scarbrough (2000: 251) is useful in\nthis regard, for she argues that the process of welfare retrenchment relies \u2018heavily on\nthe educative capacity of political elites\u2019. In this context, the changes that the ESA will\nintroduce partly reflect the fact that, in the words of Kemp (2000: 267), a \u2018convincing\nstory\u2019 had been constructed that suggested disability-related benefits were in need of\nreform. The didactics of the scroungerphobia had been developed to declare sick and\ndisabled claimants as less deserving than their well and able-bodied peers, and in this\nsense, what Pierson (1994) described as an element of systematic retrenchment can be\napplied to programme-specific retrenchment strategies.\nJus t i f y ing re t renchment : the oppor tun i t y to work\nThe 1995 Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) makes it illegal for employers to\ndiscriminate against disabled people in their hiring practices and procedures, and forces\nthem to make \u2018reasonable adjustments\u2019 to these and their premises to facilitate the\nemployment of disabled people. While the DDA is problematic because it does little\nto reduce power inequalities between disabled people and employers (Roulstone, 2000),\nit does at least utilise the social model of disability because it is more concerned with the\ncircumstances in which people are disabled.\nThe implication of the DDA is that sick and disabled people should be able to\ncompete with their able-bodied peers on a more equal basis in what is described as the\n\u2018modern, dynamic economy\u2019 (Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, 2006: 3). The ESA\nis consistent with this line of argument, and, arguably, without the DDA there would be\nlittle point in placing greater pressure \u2013 as we will shall see that the ESA will do \u2013 upon\nsick and disabled to seek paid work (cf. Grover and Piggott, 2005; Fothergill and Wilson,\n2007). Hence, underpinning the drive to get sick and disabled people competing for, and\ninto, work is the idea that post-industrial labour markets \u2013 the shift to \u2018flexible\u2019 labour\nmarkets in light manufacturing and the service sector \u2013 has opened up work opportunities\n163\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 16 Nov 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nLinda Piggott and Chris Grover\nto them (Grover and Piggott, 2005). In a discourse that is similar to that of the DDA the\nDWP (2007a: 1) recently argued, for example, that the ESA\u2019s Work Capability Test will:\nassess what an individual can do \u2013 rather than can\u2019t do. For example, you will no longer score\npoints simply because you are unable to walk more than 400 metres. Instead the new test will\nlook at things like a person\u2019s ability to use a computer keyboard or a mouse, because this type\nof task is likely to be needed in the workplace.\nWhile such discourse sounds positive and constructs the new Work Capability\nAssessment as a mechanism that will help people into work, it is difficult to predict\nhow such ways of talking about sickness and disability will be translated into practice. In\nparticular, it is not entirely clear that post-industrial work provides the solution to disabled\npeople\u2019s exclusion from labour markets. Barnes (2003), for example, argues that the more\ntechnically sophisticated a society becomes the more disability it creates. In terms of\nemployment, this is because supply-side focused measures, such as training schemes\nand subsidised wages \u2018reinforce, rather than undermine, the traditional assumption that\ndisabled workers are somehow not equal to non-disabled peers\u2019 (ibid.: 66). Moreover, as\nWeber (2006) points out, changing forms and practices of work may actually eliminate\nsome traditional means of participation by, for example, designing technology that is\ninaccessible for certain groups of users. Sapey (2000) demonstrates that what he terms\nthe \u2018informational sector\u2019 is less likely to employ disabled people than more traditional\nindustrial sectors. What these points indicate is that there are no guarantees that the\npost-industrial labour markets will be any more receptive, and may be less receptive, to\nemploying sick and disabled people. And this is before factors are taken into account that,\neven in the context of the DDA, suggest that many employers are not willing to employ\ndisabled people, particularly those with mental health issues and learning difficulties\n(SWAN, 2006; RADAR, 2006; Disability Rights Commission, 2007).\nThe approach of the government also raises questions about where the jobs for a\nmillion sick and disabled people are to come from. While those organisations that have\na vested interest, because of the privatisation of the Pathways to Work (PtW) initiative, in\ntalking up the potential of markets to provide sick and disabled people with paid work,1\nthere is a clear geography of IB receipt concentrated in those areas of Northern England,\nScotland andWales that until the 1980s were characterised by heavy industry and primary\nproduction, areas that require employment growth \u2018to accelerate sharply, or other sources\nof new labour supply . . . to dry up if big reductions in IB claimant numbers are to be\nabsorbed\u2019 (Fothergill and Wilson, 2007: 1021; see also Webster, 2006). The government,\nhowever, puts its faith in an extension of the PtW initiative as the way of delivering a\n\u2018work first\u2019 vision to sick and disabled people receiving the new ESA, a service that, on\nthe whole, is to be delivered by the private sector.\nRet renchment and pr i va t i s ing work p lacement serv ices\nPierson (2006) argues that in analysing retrenchment the focus should be upon structural\nshifts in the welfare state rather than spending cuts per se. In this context, he suggests that\ntransfers of responsibility to the private sector are an indicator of retrenchment. This view\nis exemplified in the way that employment services for getting sick and disabled people\ninto paid work are, on the whole, to be removed from the public sector service, Jobcentre\n164\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 16 Nov 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nRetrenching Incapacity Benefit\nPlus. While tranches of the privatisation of Pathways to Work (PtW) were announced in\n2007 (DWP 2007b, 2007c), with 40 per cent of Jobcentre Plus areas being left in the\npublic sector, it was announced in February 2008 that all job placement services for ESA\nclaimants would be privatised,2 with providers being rewarded for the number of people\nthey place into work and the length of time they stay there (Secretary of State for Work and\nPensions, 2007). What this means is that sick and disabled people will be commodified as\na resource that can be traded between private sector placement services and employers.\nIn this sense, not only are sick and disabled people increasingly defined as unemployed\nlabour, they are also a resource for private sector companies to profit from; they are a\ncommodity to be traded.\nThe privatisation of placement services that will underpin the ESA regime also points\nto the fact that there are often vested interests pushing for welfare retrenchment. The\npressure to extend the privatisation of job placement services came from representatives\nof capital, most notably the investment banker, David Freud (2007, for critique see Grover,\n2007) upon whose \u2018radical vision\u2019 the privatisation of ESA job placement is to be based\n(Secretary of State forWork and Pensions, 2008: 7). Freudwas employed to outline policies\nhe felt were required to meet the government target of an 80 per cent employment rate.\nThe use of private sector job placement services, he argued, would be central to this aim\n(Freud, 2007). The creation of another market through privatisation would be particularly\nattractive to the private sector because of the amounts of money to be made. \u2018The fiscal\nprize\u2019, Freud (2007: 75) argued, \u2018is considerable\u2019 for the private sector. Freud demonstrates\na connection between the private sector and the public sector at a broad level. There are\nmore direct connections, for the companies that already hold some contracts for the\ndelivery of the PtW programme and are likely to be in the running for the new contracts\nas ESA also have connections to government. A4e, a \u2018successful international business\nand a market leader in global public service reform\u20193 has a non-executive director who\nis a former Permanent Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry, while the Chief\nExecutive Officer of Ingeus Europe Ltd, the parent company of Work Directions (\u2018one of\nthe leading welfare-to-work providers in the country\u20194) is a former Head of Finance for\nthe New Deal Implementation Project. Such networks \u2018connect major players and are\nan important avenue through which business is able to \u201creach\u201d\u2019 government (Farnsworth,\n2006: 83).\nIn this sense, the interests of the private sector are being privileged in a process of\nretrenchment over those of the interest groups attempting to defend welfare provision, for\nthere has been much concern raised about the privatisation of job placement services.\nCentral to such concerns is the way in which private sector companies will be paid.\nMIND (2006, para. 4.4), for instance, is concerned that \u2018outcome-based contracts will\nmean contractors focus on getting people off benefit, as opposed to supporting people\ninto suitable employment at a pace that suits them\u2019, while the Disability Alliance (2006,\npara 3.3) is concerned \u2018about private companies being able to tell disabled people they\nhave to apply for a job or lose their benefit, particularly if the private company has an\nincentive to do this\u2019.\nSuch concerns are the consequence of the introduction of the profit motive into\nemployment placement services. This can be fundamentally problematic. In Australia, for\nexample, practices have been indentified that \u2018are arguably fraudulent as well as unethical\u2019\n(Saunders, 2008: 28). Such practices include getting conscripts on programmes appointed\nto low status jobs and then having them promoted; paying employers when conscripts do\n165\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 16 Nov 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nLinda Piggott and Chris Grover\nnot turn up for work to demonstrate a continuous record of employment and \u2018outcome\nbuying\u2019 (subsidising \u2018employers so they will create short-term jobs that would otherwise\nnot exist\u2019) (ibid.). Furthermore, Lilley and Hartwich (2008: 5) argue that the international\nevidence suggests that: \u2018\u201cCreaming\u201d, where companies concentrate on the people who\nare easiest to get back to work, and \u201cparking\u201d, where private providers ignore the hardest\nto get into employment, can be significant problems.\u2019\nCond i t iona l re t renchment : f rom the Persona l Capab i l i t y Assessment\nto the Work Capab i l i t y Assessment\nChanging conditions \u2013 for example qualifying criteria, under which welfare benefits and\nservices are provided \u2013 can be an indication of retrenchment (Palier, 2006; Pierson,\n2006). If the toughening of eligibility criteria is an indication of retrenchment, then there\ncan be little doubt that the ESA is an example par excellence of it because it will be\ntougher to claim it in the first instance and, for the work-related activity group, it places\nemployment-related activities more centrally to the process of claiming, and it introduces\nfinancial penalties for sick and disabled claimants who are deemed not to be adequately\nengaging in those activities that are expected of them (Puttick, 2007). As we have noted,\nthe government has been keen to promote the fact that one half of all people applying for\nESA will be denied it, a fact that angered disability related voluntary groups who \u2018accused\nthe government of \u201cmisleading\u201d campaigners by previously saying their reforms were not\naimed at removing people from benefits but at giving them more support\u2019.5\nThe figure of a rejection rate of 50 per cent (representing 20,000 applicants) comes\nfrom an exercise carried out by working groups, consisting predominantly of medical\npractitioners (see Physical Function andMental Health Technical Working Groups, 2006),\nthat suggested 51 per cent of people would fail to meet the criteria of the ESA\u2019s Work\nCapability Assessment, compared to 39 per cent who would have failed to meet the\nexisting Personal Capability Assessment (Henderson, 2007: para. 28). In other words, the\nnew test will prevent nearly a third more people than the current test from accessing the\nnew income replacement benefit for sick and disabled people. Those people declined\nESA will either have to claim Jobseekers\u2019 Allowance or find work.\nIn the initial three month period \u2013 what is termed the \u2018assessment phase\u2019 \u2013 as well\nas attending work focused interviews, an applicant will undergo medical examinations\nto determine whether, first, they have \u2018\u201climited capability for work\u201d as a result of his [sic]\nphysical or mental condition, and, if he has, whether that limitation makes it unreasonable\nto require him work\u2019 (Puttick, 2007: 391) and, second, whether limited capability means\n\u2018that it is not reasonable to require him to engage in work related activity\u2019 (ibid.). Those\nclaimants who it is deemed it would be unreasonable to expect to work because of their\nlimited capability will be placed in what is termed the \u2018support group\u2019 and will receive\na more financially valuable support component of ESA. Those people deemed not to\nhave limited capability for work will be paid a lower level work-related component6 that\nwill have job-related conditionality attached (discussed below). In this context, it could\nbe argued that in addition to the economic reasons (see Grover and Piggott, 2005) for\ndistinguishing between the work-related activity and support groups, it is a strategy for\nweakening the opposition to the ESA by dividing it and concentrating resources on those\nheld to be more deserving; what Pierson (1994: Chapter 1) describes as strategies of\ndivision and compensation.\n166\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 16 Nov 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nRetrenching Incapacity Benefit\nThe gateway onto IB was held (Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, 2006) to be\nonly one of the problems with it. Another set of problems was held to be related to the\nlength of time people claimed IB. IB was accused of encouraging people to remain on\nit because of its structure (the amount of benefit increased as time passed) and because\nlittle was expected of IB claimants in terms of their seeking work. The ESA is set to address\nthese issues by, first, ensuring that the amount paid to claimants increases only once, at\nthe end of the 12 week assessment phase providing the claimant has proven that they\nhave a limited capability to work. After that, claimants will receive inflationary increases\nonly. This compares to IB that increases at the 29th and 53rd week of a claim.7\nSecond, and perhaps most controversially the ESA will expect employment support\nclaimants to engage in job-related activities on the threat of benefit sanctions (see Work\nand Pensions Select Committee, 2006; Messere and Stenger, 2007; Puttick, 2007). If\nthe claimant does not adequately engage in the job-related activities \u2013 work-focused\ninterviews, work-focused health assessments and, when financial resources allow, other\nwork related activities \u2013 demanded of them, the level of ESA will be reduced in two steps\nto the level of the Jobseekers Allowance. In this sense, the ESA is part of the trend towards\nincreasing conditionality as part of renegotiated welfare \u2018deal\u2019 between the citizen and\nstate (Dwyer, 2004). In the context of this process of the withdrawal from the provision\nof social rights, concerns have been expressed about impoverishing sick and disabled\npeople through benefit sanctions (Grover, 2007) and the need for compulsion has also\nbeen criticised (Stafford, 2003). In particular, concerns have been raised about the extent\nof conditionality involved in the ESA, given the extent still of disabilism in labour markets\n(British Council of Disabled People, 2006), the poor performance of PtW in getting older\ndisabled people into work (Age Concern, 2006) and the poor chances of many sick and\ndisabled people actually getting into work because of the state of local labour markets\n(Disability Benefits Consortium, 2006). In addition, evidence from the DWP (Mitchell\nand Woodfield, 2008) suggests that the conditionality attached to PtW has the effect of\nexacerbating mental health issues.\nConc lus ion\nThis paper has argued that we are currently witnessing retrenchment in the income\nreplacement benefits for sick and disabled people. This is visible at the programme and\nsystemic level. At a programme level we can see characteristics \u2013 privatisation and changes\nto the eligibility of rules \u2013 outlined by Pierson (2006) as representing retrenchment. We\nsuggest that at a systemic level connections have to be made between public attitudes\nand social policy changes.\nThe combination of increased conditionality and the privatisation of job placement\nservices is particularly worrying, for it is at odds with the government\u2019s concern with\nthe social exclusion of sick and disabled people. In contrast, the developments we have\noutlined suggest that the retrenchment of benefits for sick and disabled people is aimed\nat the creation of a pool of labour that can be traded between privatised job placement\nservices and employers and, in this sense, the ESA can be interpreted as creating a group\nof disadvantaged people through which the private sector can profit. In this context, it\nis difficult to see how the new ESA regime will contribute to the government\u2019s vision\nthat: \u2018By 2025, disabled people in Britain should have full opportunities and choices to\n167\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 16 Nov 2009 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nLinda Piggott and Chris Grover\nimprove their quality of life and will be respected and included as equal members of\nsociety\u2019 (Prime Minister\u2019s Strategy Unit, 2005: 6).\nNotes\n1 The Shaw Trust, for instance, told the Work and Pensions Select Committee (2006, para. 314) that\n\u2018they had yet to see evidence that local labour markets were unable to find the jobs required to help more\nincapacity benefits claimants move into work\u2019.\n2 It is the case that voluntary sector organisations can be bid for and have been successful in securing\ncontracts for Pathways to Work. However, it is clear that the preference is for private sector contractors.\nOf the 35 contracts awarded the vast majority (27 or 77.1 per cent) have gone to the private sector and\nthe proportion awarded to the voluntary sector only increased after protestations from its representatives.\n3 http:\/\/www.a4e.co.uk\/Home.aspx (accessed 28 February 2008).\n4 http:\/\/www.workdirections.co.uk\/default.aspx?SectionID=2&PagesID=2 (accessed 28 February\n2008).\n5 http:\/\/www.disabilitynow.org.uk\/latest-news2\/storm-over-new-work-capability-test (accessed 27\nFebruary 2006).\n6 For instance, for a single person aged 25 or over (disabled under the age of 35) in receipt of\nincome-based ESA, the difference between the support and work-related activity groups in the level of\nESA was \u00a317.60 per week in October 2008.\n7 In fact, compared to the existing IB regime, ESA financially disadvantages claimants who were\ndisabled at younger ages (especially under the age of 35 years), particularly those who claim for long\nperiods of time (over a year). So, for example, in October 2008 such a single person in receipt of\ncontributory ESA became \u00a3923 per annum worse of under ESA compared to IB if they are in the work-\nrelated activity group and \u00a37.80 per annum if they are in the support group.\nRefe rences\nAge Concern (2006), Age Concern\u2019s submission to the Work and Pensions Select Committee inquiry on\nthe Government\u2019s Employment Strategy, London: Age Concern.\nBarnes, C.
