Introduction\n[2] Understanding the future response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet\nto global climate change necessarily involves investigations of ice-\nstream dynamics and the processes operating at ice-stream beds.\nIce streams, together with fast-flowing outlet glaciers, may account\nfor as much as 90% of drainage from the Antarctic Ice Sheet\n[Morgan et al., 1982], and they play a key role in controlling its\nstability and dynamics. Given the relative inaccessibility of the\nsub-ice stream environment, however, it is increasingly recognised\nthat the paths of paleo-ice streams hold key information about ice-\nstream processes and their controls [Stokes and Clark, 1999; Shipp\net al., 1999; Canals et al., 2000]. In Antarctica, identification of\nzones of former fast flow is critical in order to address questions\nconcerning changes in the stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from\nthe Pleistocene to the present day.\n[3] In this paper, we describe streamlined subglacial bedforms\nthat record flow of a paleo-ice stream across the west Antarctic\nPeninsula continental shelf (Figure 1). The bedforms are located in\na trough that extends from Marguerite Bay across the continental\nshelf to the shelf edge. We address the following questions: (1)\nwhat is the paleo-glaciological significance of the streamlined\nbedforms in terms of the extent of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice\nSheet (APIS) along its western margin during the last glacial\nmaximum (LGM)? Previous reconstructions range from an ice\nsheet that extended to the shelf break [Pudsey et al., 1994] to an\nice-sheet restricted to the mid-shelf [Pope and Anderson, 1992]. (2)\nWhat can we infer about conditions at the former ice-stream bed in\nregard to the controls on bedform genesis and fast glacier flow?\n2. Subglacial Bedforms\n[4] EM120 (12 kHz) multibeam swath bathymetry and TOPAS\nsub-bottom profiler data (0.5\u20135 kHz) were collected during cruise\nJR59 of the RRS James Clark Ross. The survey extended 400 km\nacross the continental shelf along a trough from inner Marguerite\nBay to the shelf edge (Figure 1). Water depths decrease along the\ntrough from about 1600 m on the inner shelf to just over 500 m at\nthe shelf edge. Navigation data were acquired using differential\nGPS.\n[5] On the inner shelf, bedforms at the mouth of George VI\nSound comprise short, irregular drumlins and crudely streamlined\nforms with blunt stoss and more tapered lee sides (Figure 2a).\nBedform lengths range from 1100 to 3450 m, while widths range\nfrom 300 to 1900 m. Length to width ratios range from 2:1 to 4:1.\nWith distance along the trough, bedforms become progressively\nmore elongate, with lengths of 2830\u20136830 m, widths of 550\u20132350\nm and length to width ratios of 3:1\u20139:1 (Figure 2f ). The irregular\nappearance of the seafloor (Figure 2a), and lack of acoustic\npenetration of the seabed on TOPAS profiles, suggest that sediment\ncover is thin and localized in the inner shelf trough [cf. Pope and\nAnderson, 1992] and that many of the bedforms are at least\npartially formed in bedrock. Occasional meltwater channels are\npresent (Figure 2b). Channels show areas of overdeepening along\ntheir thalwegs, suggesting they are of subglacial origin.\n[6] Across the mid-shelf, bedforms become progressively more\nelongate (Figures 2d and 2f ), and their increasingly smooth\nappearance on the swath bathymetry suggests a gradual transition\nto forms composed predominantly of sediment. However, bedrock\ncrops out locally at the surface in this region, suggesting that\nsediment cover may be relatively thin. Bedform lengths range from\n3200\u201310,100 m and widths range from 200\u20131260 m.

Bedforms comprise classical drumlins, highly attenuated\ndrumlins, and shallow lineations\/flutings (Figures 2c and 2f ).\nThe stoss-sides of several drumlins exhibit crescentic overdeepen-\nings, and the most attenuated bedforms occur in the deepest parts\nof the trough (Figure 2d). Subglacial meltwater channels are\noccasionally present (Figure 2d). Piston cores, up to 4.8 m long,\nrecovered from the trough (Figure 1) penetrated overconsolidated,\nmassive diamicts that are texturally and mineralogically homoge-\nneous [Kennedy and Anderson, 1989]. Their composition indicates\na restricted source on northern Alexander Island, and Kennedy and\nAnderson [1989] interpret them as basal tills.\n[7] Drumlins are replaced on the outer shelf, north of 67\u0001320S,\nby mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGL) formed in sediment\n(Figure 2e). MSGL extend to the shelf edge but become pro-\ngressively disrupted by iceberg plough marks in water depths of\nless than 520 m. MSGL are about 10,000 m to >17,000 m long\nand 130\u2013400 m wide. Length to width ratios increase from about\n30:1 to 90:1, falling to 77:1 towards the shelf edge (Figure 2f ).\nTOPAS profiles show a thick (8\u201315 m), acoustically transparent\nsediment layer with a smooth basal reflector, overlain by a thin\ntransparent drape (Figure 3). The layer is restricted to the trough\nand is interpreted as till. Drilling at ODP site 1097 (Figure 1)\nrecovered massive, matrix-supported diamictite with reworked\nmarine microfossils that Eyles et al. [2001] interpreted as defor-\nmation till.\n3. Paleo-Glaciological Significance\n[8] Streamlined subglacial bedforms in Marguerite Trough\nbecome progressively more elongate from inner Marguerite Bay\nto the shelf break. This bedform continuum records the former\npresence of a major, grounded ice stream that drained through\nMarguerite Trough and reached the continental shelf edge\nduring the LGM. This interpretation is supported by: (1) the\nbedforms occur in a cross-shelf trough and such troughs are\ncommonly loci for ice streams draining modern ice sheets; (2)\ndownflow evolution in the morphology of subglacial bedforms\nalong the trough (Figure 2f ) is consistent with a progressive\nincrease in ice-stream velocity across the shelf [cf. Clark, 1993;\nShipp et al., 1999]; (3) the most elongate bedforms on the\nmid-shelf are located in the central part of the trough where\nflow velocities would be highest; (4) bedform orientation\nindicates convergent ice flow into the trough; and (5) the\nrestricted source area for basal tills in the mid-shelf trough\n[Kennedy and Anderson, 1989]. Transitions between bedforms\nare gradational and large-scale switches in flow direction as\nevidenced by well-developed, spatially extensive, zones of\ncrosscutting bedforms are absent. This is consistent with bed-\nform generation by streaming flow along the length of the\ntrough. Crosscutting, where present, is both localized and\nrelatively minor. The apparent absence of a mid-shelf ground-\ning-zone, well-preserved nature of the bedforms, and absence of\nlarge-scale bedform crosscutting, points to rapid deglaciation of\nthe trough.\n[9] The ice stream had a maximum length of about 370 km if\nour interpretation of streaming flow along the length of the\ntrough is correct. The substrate changes from crystalline on the\ninner shelf, to sedimentary across the mid-outer shelf [Bart and\nAnderson, 1995; Larter et al., 1997]. The gradational continuum\nof subglacial bedforms suggests that streaming flow operated\nacross both substrates. Estimates of ice-stream width are con-\nstrained by our data coverage, but if it is assumed that the ice\nstream filled the trough as defined by the 500 m bathymetric\ncontour (Figure 1), it would have been about 35 km wide and\n>400 m thick at the terminus. This thickness estimate is based on\n\u0002500 m water depth at the shelf edge minus 120 m eustatic sea\nlevel rise since the LGM, but it disregards local glacioisostatic\neffects. This cross-section would produce an ice flux of 14 km3\nyr\u00031, assuming a velocity of 1 km yr\u00031.\n4. Conditions at the Ice-Stream Bed\n[10] Cores and TOPAS data indicate the presence of basal till in\nthe mid-outer shelf trough. Till formation was probably controlled\nby the change in substrate from crystalline bedrock on the inner\nshelf, to sedimentary bedrock across the mid-shelf, to a thick\nsequence of Cenozoic glacigenic sediments on the outer shelf\nFigure 1. Location map of the study area showing bathymetry,\nship track and location of cores containing basal till [Kennedy and\nAnderson, 1989] referred to in text. The cross-shelf trough is\ndefined by the 500 m contour. Bathymetric profiles XX0, YY0 and\nZZ0 show the high relief of the trough and the bedforms within it\non the inner and middle shelf, compared with the outer shelf. The\ndashed line CSCS0 demarcates the approximate transition between\ncrystalline bedrock and sedimentary substrate. Outline of sedi-\nmentary basin on shelf is from Larter et al. [1997]. \u2018\u2018BS\u2019\u2019 on inset\nmap = Bellingshausen Sea.\n41 - 2 O\u00b4 COFAIGH ET AL: SUBGLACIAL BEDFORMS, ANTARCTIC SHELF\n[Bart and Anderson, 1995; Larter et al., 1997]. A sedimentary\nsubstrate would be inherently more susceptible to subglacial\nerosion and would have facilitated till development beneath the\nice stream which, in turn, would have acted as a lubricant\nfacilitating fast flow [Anandakrishnan et al., 1998; Studinger et\nal., 2001].\n[11] TOPAS data from the outer shelf show a till layer in\nwhich MSGL are formed (Figure 3). MSGL record the highest\nflow velocities [Clark, 1993] and indicate ice\/bed coupling. Ice\/\nbed separation and sliding are thus unlikely to have been wide-\nspread here. This is supported by the absence of meltwater forms\non the MSGL, suggesting that meltwater evacuation was largely\naccommodated through the bed in this region. Fast flow across the\nsoft bed therefore most likely records some combination of\nsubglacial sediment deformation and\/or ploughing [Alley et al.,\n1986; Tulaczyk et al., 2001].\n[12] Geophysical data indicate that sediment cover is thin and\nlocalized on the inner shelf [cf. Bart and Anderson, 1995].\nHowever, streamlined bedforms suggest that fast flow operated\nin this region also. We interpret this to have resulted from the\npresence of meltwater at the bed, which would have facilitated\ndecoupling, enhanced basal sliding and rapid glacier motion\n[Engelhardt and Kamb, 1998]. Generation of subglacial meltwater\nand warm-based conditions would have been promoted by strain\nheating due to convergent flow into the trough. Evidence for\nsubglacial meltwater is present in the form of subglacial meltwater\nchannels, and crescentic overdeepenings around the stoss sides of\ndrumlins (Figure 2d).\nFigure 2.

The\ngradational continuum in bedform morphology and the intimate\nrelationship with the substrate, such that the most elongate forms\nare associated with a soft bed, indicates a direct connection\nbetween the genesis of streamlined subglacial bedforms, subglacial\ngeology and fast glacier flow in the geological record.\n[14] Acknowledgments.
