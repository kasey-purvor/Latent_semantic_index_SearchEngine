Holland\nLondon School of Economics & Political Science\nThis article reviews the developments in HTA in four countries, France, The Netherlands,\nSweden, and United Kingdom, in relation to public health. It emphasizes that the majority\nof assessments made are concerned with individual clinical care rather than with the\noptimization of health. Possible reasons for the neglect of public health issues are that\nthese are inherently more complex than the assessment of individual procedures or\ndrugs. They are usually multisectoral, politically charged, and often considered mundane\nand \u201ccommon sense\u201d and, thus, not requiring evaluation (although when evaluations are\ndone they are often counterintuitive). Unless more emphasis is given to the development\nand evaluation of public health measures, it is unlikely that there will be any major\nadvances in health status. Possible areas for future assessment should include such\nissues as smoking, drug and other substance misuse, nutrition, and health inequalities.\nHowever, it is unlikely that these major areas of concern will be included in the future\nunless the methods of choice for priorities of development and assessment are changed\nto include measures that improve health status rather than only clinical services.\nKeywords: Health technology assessment, Public health\nFormal evaluation of procedures and equipment, including\npharmaceutical agents, has become the norm in most health\nservices. This development of the use of evidence to influence\npractice is welcome. A particularly interesting development\nhas been the creation of formally designated centres for the as-\nsessment of health technology in several countries. \u201cCriteria\nfor the assessment of health technology have been developed\nand the field has become rapidly professionalized, with an\nemerging consensus on procedures and key findings\u201d (1).\nThis special issue contains articles that describe the\nexperience in four countries. It is interesting to observe the\nsimilarity, as well as the differences, in these. From the public\nhealth perspective, the interpretation of meaning is important.\nHealth has been defined in the preamble to the consti-\ntution of the World Health Organization, \u201cHealth is a state\nof complete physical, mental, and social well being, and not\nmerely the absence of disease or infirmity\u201d (3).\nHealth problems vary in different parts of the world but\ncan be grouped under communicable disease, noncommuni-\ncable disease, trauma, and mental disorders. It is generally\naccepted that the major determinants of health are nutrition,\nenvironmental and occupational hazards, lifestyle, income,\nand biological factors such as genetics. Clinical or medical\ncare services undoubtedly contribute to levels of health but\nare of a much lesser order of magnitude than the above\nlisted determinants. It is noteworthy that the four studies\nlargely cover the assessment of clinical procedures, drugs,\ntechniques, and equipment.\nThe French government has a National Agency for\nAccreditation and Evaluation in Health (ANAES). It has had a\nrole in contributing to health policy by its recommendations\non screening, for example, for breast cancer (positive) and\nhemochromatosis (negative). ANAES is stated as addressing\npublic health programs on cancer, cardiovascular disease, and\ndiabetes, but no examples are given of evaluations on actually\npreventing these conditions.\nThe Swedish study is more careful in its use of terminol-\nogy for HTA as it talks of medical technology and health.\nIt is of particular interest that Sweden\u2019s early initiatives\nwere on polio vaccination and water fluoridation. This study\nalso emphasizes the stimulus provided by the US Office\nof Technology Assessment, which were largely concerned\nwith \u201cbig ticket\u201d (expensive) technologies. This contribution\nemphasizes that, after this original concern with services to\n77\nW.W. Holland\nimprove health, the next period was largely devoted to the\nassessment of medical technologies and clinical procedures.\nOnly more recently have the projects again become con-\ncerned with the wider problems of health and prevention,\ne.g., tobacco and oral health or the prevention of obesity.\nThis has been linked to the treatment of specific conditions,\nfor example, anxiety states, depression, and psychosis, and\nnot only the assessment of individual drugs or procedures.\nThe authors emphasize the need for more critical assessment\nof the complex interventions of health promotion activities,\norganizational changes or caring for individual groups of the\npopulation such as the elderly. They accept that the methods\nand criteria for these will need to be different (and probably\nmore complex) than those used in clinical research.\nIn The Netherlands, economic evaluations were intro-\nduced in response to high-cost health technologies such as\nheart and liver transplantations. Later assessments were con-\ncerned with routinely used services, for example, psycho-\ntherapy and cancer drugs.\nIn the United Kingdom, HTA is also primarily concerned\nwith the evaluation of clinical procedures including screening\n(which can be classified as secondary prevention). Of the\n117 National Health Service\u2019s Research and Development\nprogram (the NHS R&D program) reports published between\n1997 and 2001, 19 were concerned with screening services,\nand 28 were methodological\u2014for example, Bayesian meth-\nods, assessment of costs in randomized control trials, and\npublication biases. Several were concerned with services\nfor specific groups\u2014for example, outpatient services for\nchronic pain control. Only one was concerned with pri-\nmary prevention\u2014\u201chealth promoting schools and health\npromotion in schools: two systematic reviews.\u201d The authors\ndescribe with great clarity the various mechanisms that have\nbeen put in place and the differences between assessment and\nappraisal.\nPUBLIC HEALTH AND HTA\nThese studies illustrate the problem that public health faces.\nThere is little dispute about the relative contributions that\npublic health and clinical measures can make to the improve-\nments of health status of populations. But we are confounded\nby the terms and language we use. Terminology often leads to\nmisunderstanding. Thus, the difference between private and\npublic health, for example, requires clarification. The term\nclinical services describes more aptly those health services\nthat focus on the cure and care of individual patients, whether\nthese are publicly or privately financed. An effective public\nhealth service identifies and responds to health problems to\nprotect the health of populations. It is unfortunate that the\nterm health technology assessment (HTA) has taken on such\na universal usage\u2014as shown in the studies, and discussed\nhere, the majority of subjects tackled are concerned with\nindividual clinical care rather than with the optimization of\nhealth.\nIf one considers the history of the development of formal\nassessment of technical procedures to improve and main-\ntain health, the best examples are in the field of immuniza-\ntion, where large-scale trials of vaccines were carried out, for\nexample, diphtheria, poliomyelitis (both the killed and live\nvaccines), and measles. These rarely included the economic\nassessments now deemed mandatory, although rough esti-\nmates of resource consequences were made. The assessments\nof benefits were in terms of mortality or cases.\nA good example of the assessment of changes in practice\nto prevent maternal mortality in the 1930s were the studies\nby Colebrook and colleagues of the ways in which delivery\nin hospital needed to be changed to reduce the risk of strepto-\ncoccal infection. Again these studies did not include formal\neconomic assessments.\nIn most of the examples quoted from the four coun-\ntries, the consideration of topics appears limited to drugs,\nequipment, and a few services, for example, transplantation.\nAlthough HTA requires sophisticated economic analyses of\nthe procedures examined, there would seem to be a gap in the\nuse of economic assessments of what actually is important\nin improving health. From the public health viewpoint, this\nis far too narrow a perspective. Obviously, there is a need to\nevaluate different types of hip prostheses or transplantation\n(to give just two examples), but these are not necessarily the\nmajor \u201cdrivers\u201d of health concerns.\nIt is perfectly understandable why some types of drugs\nhave been included in HTA evaluations\u2014their cost may be\nvery high; thus, it is important to balance these with the ben-\nefits. However, the treatment of the appropriate individuals\nwith such drugs, although of benefit to the individual, will\nhave little effect on the health status of the population.\nThe rigorous examination of screening procedures in all\nfour countries has an effect on population health status. It is,\nhowever, disappointing that, except in Sweden, there appears\nto be little effort to tackle the assessment of measures which\nmight have a large effect on health, rather than on only clinical\nservices.\nExamples that would lend themselves to tackling issues\nof health might be technological measures to reduce the in-\ncidence of accidents in childhood, for example, measures to\nreduce road accidents or fires in the home. A major social and\nhealth problem, particularly in inner city areas, is pregnancy\nin women under 16 years, or even single parenthood. Clearly\nthese are very much more difficult areas to tackle than which\nscreening tests to use or how to manage dyspepsia\u2014but tack-\nling them, and providing guidance, might have an important\neffect on health status.\nPOSSIBLE REASON FOR THE DEARTH\nOF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES IN HTA\nThere are several possible reasons why HTA has not engaged\nin public health issues. First, public health programs are in-\nherently far more complex to evaluate than, for example, a\n78 INTL. J. OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE 20:1, 2004\nHTA and public health: A commentary\nnew drug or diagnostic procedure. In the former case, one\naims to identify beneficial effects in terms of function or out-\ncome as measured by mortality and side-effects. In the latter\ncase, the end point is usually an improvement in diagnosis. A\npublic health program may lead to lower mortality (or mor-\nbidity), but this is usually on a far longer time scale than, for\nexample, the effect of treatment on a patient with a disease\nwith a new drug. The change in smoking habits as a result\nof antismoking measures took many years to be evident in\nmortality (or morbidity). Many public health measures may\nlead to changes in attitude\u2014but behavior change and im-\nproved outcome, except in rare instances, take a long time to\noccur.\nSecond, the introduction of public health measures\nare often complex and require the cooperation of multi-\nple agencies or organizations, as well as often involving\npayment by individuals from their own resources and chang-\ning their behaviors. A good example was the introduction\nof the Clean Air Act in 1956, which entailed a change in\nthe way homes were heated. Of course, this measure has\nhad a dramatic effect on both health and the environment, as\nseen after approximately 15 years. Thus, not only is the time\nscale different for the introduction of a new drug\/machine,\nbut the degree of complexity is of a different order of\nmagnitude.\nThird, public health interventions are frequently politi-\ncally charged and resisted by powerful groups. An example in\nthe nineteenth century was the resistance to the introduction\nof sanitary regulations, which was opposed by landlords\nand shopkeepers. Currently, tobacco control and tobacco\nadvertising is a good example of how powerful economic in-\ndustries, allied to their political friends, can stymie suggested\npublic health measures\u2014and their evaluation.\nFourth, it must not be forgotten that many public health\nmeasures are considered to be common sense, or obvious, and\nproper assessment is resisted\u2014for example, the usefulness\nof routine health examinations in the middle aged (shown\nto have no effect on mortality or morbidity and yet still\npropagated by many).\nFifth, another obstacle to HTA neglect of public health\nis the lack of charisma of public health measures\u2014cleaning\nup the water supply or adding fluoride to water is far less\nnewsworthy than evaluating a new molecular drug or shiny\npiece of machinery that is promoted by powerful industrial\ngroups and their client-media. Because priorities for HTA\nare not set by individuals concerned with wider public health\nissues but by clinicians, nurses, managers, consumers, etc.,\nit is not surprising that public health issues take a back\nseat.\nAs I mention below, unless there is a major improvement\nin both the funding for public health research, the standing\nand influence of public health in the setting of health (not clin-\nical) priorities, and in the number of well-trained researchers\nand implementers of public health research, it is unlikely that\nmuch change in the status quo will occur.\nSUGGESTED FRAMEWORK FOR\nINCLUSION OF PUBLIC HEALTH\nISSUES IN HTA\nIf public health issues are to be included in HTA it is crucial\nthat there be both agreement on their objectives as well as\ntheir prioritization. The actual design of a public health HTA\nwould follow accepted research methodology.\nPossible outcomes for public health would include:\n(a) improved health status,\n(b) risk factor reduction,\n(c) improved services and protection,\n(d) appropriate methods for continuing surveillance.\nExamples of areas where public health measures need\nto be developed and assessed are smoking, alcohol-related\nharm, drug and other substance misuse, nutrition, accidental\ninjuries, birth control, physical and sensory disability, and\nhealth inequalities.\nIn each of these areas, all of major importance to health\nand health services, the possible, promising interventions\nwould need to be identified. The population \u201cat risk\u201d and\nsuitable measures of outcome, as outlined above, need to be\nidentified, developed, and applied. The time scale for an eval-\nuation would depend on the problem and the size of the trial\u2014\nfor example, an evaluation of measures to reduce childhood\naccidents could, probably, be achieved in a 2-year period if the\nsize of the exposed population was large enough (5\u201310 large\nprimary schools). The evaluation of methods to promote less\nconceptions in girls below age 15 is likely to be somewhat\nlengthier\u20143\u20135 years at best. The problems are likely to arise\nin both identifying and prioritizing suitable technologies for\nassessment as well as gaining the necessary participation of\nappropriate test and control populations\u2014all of whom would\nconsider themselves healthy in contrast to patients with a\ndisease or problem.\nOTHER ISSUES INCLUDED AND OMITTED\nIN HTA\nAlthough the topics chosen by each of the countries include\nsome examples of assessment of organizational structures,\nnone address some of the major issues that need to be ad-\ndressed. No examples are given of the assessment of different\ntypes of personnel to deal with medical issues\u2014for example,\ndo we need to see a doctor, and if not, would a nurse do?\nAlthough call services have been introduced in the\nUnited Kingdom, they have not been evaluated with the\nsame rigor as individual drugs\u2014and yet they have far greater\nconsequences. This narrowness of approach to evaluate what\nis easy and simple to do is undoubtedly necessary\u2014and has\nchanged the climate for the acceptance of proper evaluation\u2014\nbut is very limited in its effect on the methods and costs\nof health service delivery. A far more open and wider\nINTL. J. OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE 20:1, 2004 79\nW.W. Holland\nperspective is required if we are to improve the health of\nthe public rather than only improve the delivery of individual\nclinical services.\nStevens and Milne comment that, in the United\nKingdom, the major stimulus to HTA was the House of\nLords Report on Priorities in Medical Research (2), but they\nfail to say that the major aims of the committee have been\nneglected. Certainly, the creation of the NHS R&D Direc-\ntorate has had a powerful effect in increasing activity in health\nservices research. But, as I have pointed out above, this is\nnot equivalent to public health. The Committee emphasized\nthe need to \u201cencourage the long-term development of public\nhealth and operational research. The Committee have no\ndoubt that these are areas of research which would repay\u2014\nliterally repay\u2014investment. The Committee recommend that\nspending in these areas should, therefore, be markedly\nincreased\u201d (para 4.13). \u201cThe Committee believe that these\nrecommendations underpin, rather than duplicate, the recom-\nmendations made in the Acheson Report on \u201cPublic Health\u201d\nin England . . . Monitoring of health is not enough: systematic\npublic health research must be undertaken . . . .\u201d (para 4.14).\nIt is unfortunate that, since the publication of the House\nof Lords Report, the issues considered of primary impor-\ntance in improving public health research capability, which\nwould enable public health issues to be tackled under the\nHTA umbrella in the UK, have been neglected at the expense\nof concentrating on what some would term relatively trivial\nissues concerned with individual clinical services rather than\nhealth.\nCONCLUSION\nThe concentration by HTA on single drugs or procedures such\nas neonatal screening is understandable. These issues can be\ndefined with reasonable clarity, and suitable studies\/data are\navailable or can be commissioned easily. They are of immedi-\nate relevance and interest to both industry and the providers of\nclinical services. From the public health point of view, most\nof the programs described are disappointing and irrelevant.\nConcentrating on drugs and clinical procedures does not re-\nally have a great influence on population health. The use of\nthe term health technology assessment is misleading, because\nmost assessments are limited to a single technology or instru-\nment, omitting other possible solutions for tackling a partic-\nular problem. For example, it will investigate a single proce-\ndure such as heart surgery but fails to put it into context with\nother options to reduce either the incidence of heart disease or\nother means of reducing mortality and disability from heart\ndisease. Of course, this is much more difficult, but essential\nif the objective is a national, effective, efficient health policy.\nIn England, Stevens and Milne describe some of the other\nagencies or mechanisms that have been introduced\u2014for ex-\nample, Health Service Delivery Organisation, NICE, etc. But\nalthough they and the other authors state that a formal prior-\nitization process exists and is discussed, no details are given\nof the framework within which priorities are allocated. For\nexample, whether the procedures to be assessed are primarily\nconcerned with a reduction of disability and an improvement\nof quality of life, or a reduction of mortality. Similarly, in the\nexamples given, it is difficult to understand the relation be-\ntween those chosen and the burden of disease\u2014particularly\nin the United Kingdom (for example, 2 of 117 HTA\nreviews between 1997 and 2001 were on \u201cfragile x\u201d syndrome\nscreening\u2014a very rare condition, while there was none on\nscreening for coronary heart disease, a common condition).\nThus, it may be seen that, although the HTA programs may\nbe important, both their design and content is of little public\nhealth significance. This is a great pity\u2014only the Swedes ap-\npear to have made attempts to include health in addition to\nclinical issues.\nREFERENCES\n1. Davis P.
