The first manuscript \npresented a benchmark study of leachate modelling and reviewed treatment technologies likely to \nform the basis of meeting the biodegradable municipal waste diversion targets of the Landfill \nDirective [1] in England and Wales. The second manuscript presented model development [2]. \nLandfill pollutant removal is intrinsically linked with achieving environmental equilibrium status. \nEquilibrium is defined here as that state when emissions from a landfill site occur at a rate that \nallows sufficient natural attenuation in the surrounding environment to prevent environmental \nharm, so management is no longer required. To embody the principles of sustainability, \nequilibrium can only be achieved when the management period (post-closure when the site has \nceased accepting waste for disposal) is measured in decades rather than centuries. Landfills must \nremain under management control until the surrender of a landfill permit or licence is accepted by \nthe regulator. Surrender is a site-specific determination and it can only be accepted if a landfill has \nstabilised physically, chemically and biologically to such a degree that the undisturbed contents of \nthe site are unlikely to pose a pollution risk in the landfill\u2019s environmental setting (landfill \ncompletion) [3]. \n \nPOLICY AND OPERATIONAL IMPLICATIONS \n 3\n \nSustainable Landfill \nLarge-scale modern engineered landfill sites, developed for groundwater protection, are now \na common aspect of the waste management system in many countries. Despite this, they are \ncomparatively new, with their development only starting in the 1980s. Consequently such sites, \nthat predominantly contain untreated wastes, are a long way from achieving landfill completion or \nequilibrium status. One measure of landfill sustainability, an aspect that the EU Landfill Directive \n[4] does not explicitly consider, is the timescale required to achieve landfill equilibrium. \nConsideration of landfill sustainability requires an understanding of complex landfill processes \nthat are responsible for stabilisation. There are two main methods of achieving sustainable landfill; \nflushing in situ wastes or pre-treating waste to produce residues that meet set criteria prior to \ndisposal. Current pre-treatment techniques do not produce residues capable of meeting \nstabilisation criteria [5]. \nSite-specific landfill leachate measurements provide some indication of landfill processes, but \nrecent modelling is starting to provide an understanding of the factors that control leachate quality \n[6]. An increased understanding of waste streams that disproportionately affect leachate quality \nmay suggest a change in management practice is required (e.g. waste segregation, diversion, \ndevelopment of additional pre-treatment techniques) so as to bring forward the achievement of \nequilibrium. This could ultimately increase the sustainability of landfill. \n \nStrategic Waste Management Options \n \n 4\n Whilst raw municipal solid wastes (MSW) managed within a site allowing a moderate \namount of leachate flushing, may be close to achieving equilibrium status, the requirements of the \nLandfill Directive [4] will make this option unavailable for the majority of sites as pre-treatment is \na prerequisite of the Directive. This result is contrary to predictions made in the early 1990s [7-9] \nwhen it was recognised that measures have to be taken to enhance landfill degradation processes \nelse degradation was likely to take many centuries for landfills to meet trigger concentrations. \nCombusting raw MSW in incinerators will meet the waste diversion targets, but the effect of \ncombustion and the concentration of non-combustible fractions would appear to make equilibrium \nstatus more difficult to achieve. Processing of ash (either artificially or naturally via carbonation) \nreduces the level of emissions of some heavy metals such as lead and zinc, but results in a \nsignificant increase in the sulphate emission. \n \n Coupled with the problems of landfilling the ash, there is the issue of the disposal of air \npollution control (APC) wastes and fly ash which may be classified as hazardous wastes. It is \nunlikely that APC waste from the majority of incinerators will meet the current hazardous waste \nacceptance criteria (WAC), and an additional waste pre-treatment will be needed for these wastes \n(or an alternate means of disposing of them needs to be found). \n \n Treatment technologies such as mechanical biological treatment (MBT) followed by \nintensive composting may provide a means of getting close to the objectives. However, the \nhydraulic conductivity of MBT residues may make it difficult to recirculate the fluids or introduce \nirrigation within the landfill, meaning that they will remain at low liquid\/solid (L\/S) ratios for \nextended periods. This technology does also remain highly dependent upon the feed stock \n 5\nentering the process, and there is little experience in the UK in managing variations in plant feed \nstock. \n \n Results of this study (not reported here) supported the notion that it is leachate and not \nlandfill gas (LFG) that will be the rate limiting process for achieving equilibrium status. In all cases \nthe LFG emissions fell below a manageable production rate prior to leachate reaching the \nrequirements of equilibrium status. In some cases this was marginal but in such scenarios, the \nmanagement option that best suited the requirements of rapid stabilisation included moderate \nflushing of the landfill to wash leachable contaminants from the landfill and at the same time \noptimise the rate of gas generation (in order to degrade the organic carbon as soon as possible). \n \nFlushing of Wastes \n \n The waste management industry has discussed the concept of the flushing bioreactor for \nmany years, and the majority of practitioners believe that it is fundamentally workable provided \nthere are large volumes of water available. Flushing rates in excess of 2000 mm y-1 of equivalent \ninfiltration have been reported [10] and such rates may be needed to achieve stabilisation (but \nperhaps not be achievable) for landfills in excess of 50 m deep. Some hydraulic properties of waste \nchange dramatically with depth [11]. The scenarios that we examined here concentrated on \nrelatively thin waste deposits (circa 20 m) but with considerably lower flushing rates. The \nmodelling assumed that during the operational period there is infiltration of 250 mm y-1 from \nrainfall, falling to 50 mm y-1 upon capping of the site. For the flushing scenarios, there is an \nassumed further addition of 200 mm y-1 for the MBT, raw MSW and one of the stable non-reactive \n 6\nhazardous waste options, and 500 mm y-1 for mechanically sorted organic residues (MSOR), \nincinerator bottom ash (IBA) and the other stable non-reactive hazardous wastes scenarios during \nthe period of active management. The choice was dictated in part by the results of the non-flushed \nmodel results for each waste residue. There was an assumption that if the liquid being recirculated \nis leachate (rather than water) it should have undergone at least some basic treatment to remove \nhigh concentrations of organics and ammoniacal nitrogen. Sulphate and chloride removal would \nnot normally be an issue for raw MSW or MBT residues as these leachates would be unlikely to \nreach solubility limits for these species, but could do so if concentrations were allowed to build up. \nThe reality is that additional infiltration of the order of 200 mm y-1 would be readily achievable \nfrom run-off available from capped areas for the majority of sites in the UK. Additional infiltration \namounting to 500 mm y-1 would be geographically more restrictive. Flushing as a means of \naccelerating the stabilisation of landfilled waste has been advocated for many years [10] and \nresearch continues to demonstrate that it can serve to shorten the aftercare period considerably. \nHowever, there is no real incentive for the waste industry to invest in such practice. It seems that \nthe recent revision of financial provisions was a missed opportunity to provide that incentive. It \nmight have been possible to introduce a two or three tiered system with lower amounts of money \nset aside at sites where accelerated stabilisation measures were installed. \n \n In the case of IBA landfills, the leachate would be quite different from that found in the \nmore organic sites that we are familiar with. Leachates from these landfills will be largely inorganic \nand contain primarily metal salts. Alternate leachate treatment technologies will be required and \nthe recirculation of treated leachate could be more problematic since the removal of sulphate will \nbe needed to avoid saturation of these salts. \n \n 7\n In many respects, the easiest way to achieve higher flushing rates would be to postpone the \ninstallation of a cap until equilibrium status was achieved. However, for wastes that are likely to \nrequire any form of landfill gas control, such an option is not viable. It may be an option for \nincinerator bottom ash (IBA) wastes as there is little evidence that the ash generates landfill gas, \nand odour should not be an issue. This might be a function of the site geometry as a deeper landfill \nwill require a larger degree of flushing or a longer management time to achieve the required L\/S \nratio, but the depth of the site is unlikely to have a pronounced affect on the gas generation rate \nand the time to reach equilibrium status in respect of gas. The option of removing a cap at the end \nof the gassing phase of a landfill may remain, subject to the regulatory requirements for \nminimisation of leachate production.  \n \n Removal of the cap at this stage would be similar to maintaining a flushing rate at 250 mm \ny-1 and could then proceed as a flushed site for a further 40 years or so, at which time it would \nachieve equilibrium status. Thus, this management scenario would not require re-circulation of \nleachate, nor would it require collection and injection of water specifically to achieve the flushing \nrates. The resultant time to equilibrium status would be extended by around 30 years, but would \nbe significantly shorter than if the cap were to remain in place. \n \n Furthermore, the liner performance can be expected to be better during the first century of \nits operation as the degradation due to loss of antioxidants is unlikely to occur within this period \n[12]. One issue that would make this option less favourable is the disturbance of what would have \nbeen a restored landform for some 30 years or so. \n \n 8\n The time disjoint between achieving what is modelled as equilibrium status and the \nmaximum groundwater impact probably remains one of the major obstacles to the practical use of \nthis work. It will require pragmatic regulation in order to issue a closure certificate for a landfill \nthat still contains contaminants at 10 times the water quality standard. This could be further \ncompounded by the fact that most waste permits will require a specific leachate head to be \nmaintained. In order to approach the sort of conditions that might occur when equilibrium status is \napproached, there may need to be a planned gradual increase in leachate level so that the site \nreaches some degree of hydraulic equilibrium as well as chemical equilibrium with its \nsurroundings. \n \nLeachate Strength at Equilibrium Status \n \n It was envisaged that the research would indicate a leachate strength at which equilibrium \nstatus could be shown to have been achieved and, along with other tests and monitoring data, \nallow a completion certificate to be issued for a site. The work undertaken here showed that the \nrelationship between leachate strength and equilibrium status is far from linear. Where a site meets \nour definition of equilibrium early on, then the concentrations of leachate within the site that \nsatisfy equilibrium will be higher than where the site meets the requirements later.  This is simply \na function of the degradation of the liner and capping systems where there is an expectation that \nthese systems will see degradation with advancing age. This is compounded by the fact that those \nsites that will need an extended aftercare period will also have to continue to manage leachate to a \nquality that is less polluting than one where the aftercare period is shortened due to selective \nprocessing or flushing. \n 9\n \n It has been suggested that the Inert WAC C0 values (initial eluate from the percolation test \nprCEN\/TS 14405:2003) for inert waste sites might have shown an indication of the leachate quality \nat the point of equilibrium. It was therefore worth comparing the typical ranges obtained from this \nstudy (albeit that they varied due to time dependency issues) with the WAC values for inert waste \nlandfills. A comparison of the leachate concentrations and the inert C0 values is shown in Table 1. \n \n These results indicated that while there is a generalised relationship between the formal C0 \nvalues for inert wastes and those derived from this study, the relationship is not always strong \nenough to be relied upon. This conclusion follows that of the time dependency issue; although \nthere are a number of cases where the leachate concentrations need to fall well below the inert \nWAC C0 values for inert waste sites (e.g. copper, lead and chloride). This is in part due to the way \nin which the C0 values were generated, being a combination of modelling, rounding up\/down and \na comparison with leach test data from common waste streams that are deemed to be inert. \n \nAmmoniacal Nitrogen \n \n It is clear that certain species drive the time periods required to achieve equilibrium status. \nPrior to this research it was thought that ammoniacal nitrogen would be a governing factor given \nits high concentration in raw MSW leachates and low environmental threshold. While the \nmodelling undertaken did not indicate that ammoniacal nitrogen was a major problem, it is \nrecognised that some MSW leachates contain considerably more ammoniacal nitrogen than those \n 10\nmodelled. It is of some comfort that the MBT compost process removes a large amount of \nammoniacal nitrogen and fixes the organic nitrogen in other less mobile forms. \n \n While this is to an extent reassuring, there remain a significant number of current landfills \nwithin the UK where ammoniacal nitrogen will continue to be a notable issue for many years. In \naddition, the modelling in this study assumed a composite liner. Where clay liners are used, it is \nlikely that a greater flux of ammoniacal nitrogen will result and that this may still be an issue that \naffects the attainment of equilibrium status. What is surprising is the lack of commercial \ndevelopment of the research that has shown benefits associated with the injection of nitrified \nleachate back into the waste mass. Work by Burton and Watson-Craik [13] has shown that the \nintroduction of nitrate into waste results in the denitrification of the leachate (resulting in the \nformation of nitrogen gas) and a substantial reduction in the nitrogen load within the landfill. \n \nAmmoniacal nitrogen is likely to be much more of a consideration with regard to surface waters in \ninstances where specific landfill sites are at risk of spilling over (the bathtub effect). This can occur \nas a result of continued integrity of containment coupled with the waste being saturated. Our \nmodelling thus far not included emissions to surface water, which could form a separate study. \n \nAccelerating the Achievement of Equilibrium: Air Injection \n \n In a similar vein work has been undertaken, particularly in Germany and Italy, relating to \nthe injection of compressed air into landfills that are in their methanogenic stage. Conventional \nlandfill disposal encourages waste decomposition processes that operate anaerobically. This study \n 11\nhas reported that modelled predictions suggest that landfill completion may take centuries, based \non modern highly engineered landfills. This raises the question of sustainability for both \noperational landfills and the landfill legacy i.e. sites that are no longer licensed or permitted, some \nof which pre-date regulation. Many of these latter sites are ex-local authority landfills that are often \nrelatively shallow and are slowly degrading with considerable pollution potential remaining.  This \ntreatment affords an opportunity to accelerate the stabilisation process for organic waste \naerobically and potentially return sites to market for redevelopment in a timely fashion. \nWhilst the benefits of aerobic or semi-aerobic landfill have been clearly demonstrated, \nincluding full-scale studies in Spain and Canada, many practitioners are sceptical of the benefits \nand are concerned about the risks such as gaseous emissions and entry of oxygen into a landfill \nthat could cause fires. Other uncertainty surrounds the optimum point at which to begin aeration \nand the effect of aeration on leachate parameters. \n \n Cossu et al. [14] reported the full scale stabilisation of part of a landfill (for rail construction \npurposes) by the injection of compressed air over a 140 day period. A marked drop in methane \ngeneration occurred and presumably an aerobic composting process was established. The study \ndid not report the affects on the leachate quality during this period, but it would be expected that \nthere would be a reduction in ammoniacal nitrogen production and a fall in BOD and COD, \naccompanied by a reduction in TOC levels. Work by Purcell and Walker [15] showed that on a \npilot scale, the forced aeration of green waste and shredded biodegradable MSW can achieve a \nrelatively stable residue within 6 months (aerox process). While the organic indicators (BOD, COD \nand NH4) all showed marked reductions from the control cells, unsurprisingly the total heavy \nmetal content of the waste remained virtually unaffected. The removal of some of the organic \n 12\nmaterial will result in a long-term lowering of the TOC content of the waste and a subsequent \nreduction in the capacity to generate organo-metal complexes that form readily with some metals \n(especially copper). \n \n While the aerox process was designed primarily as a means of pre-treatment of organic \nwastes, the work by Cossu [14] showed that it is feasible to undertake forced aeration in situ on a \nlandfill site scale. It may therefore be possible to speed up the stabilisation of wastes that are \napproaching the end of their methanogenic life and achieve equilibrium status at least for landfill \ngas. Certainly the application of forced air injection either at the beginning or the end of the \nlandfilling process would remove certain trace organic species that remain problematical within \nbiologically active landfills and pose a threat to groundwater quality. While a number of \nresearchers are looking at this area of forced aeration of organic wastes, rate constants still remain \nto be generated so that these processes can be readily modelled and the effects predicted. \n \nControlling Inorganic Species \n \n Depending upon the waste treatment and the applied technologies, different inorganic \nspecies appear to control the time taken to achieve equilibrium status. For conventional raw MSW, \nthese are likely to be lead and chloride (with ammoniacal nitrogen at sites where biodegradation in \nthe groundwater is unlikely, or above average concentrations exist). For MBT residues, these \ninclude lead, nickel, zinc, sulphate and chloride (but not ammoniacal nitrogen). For IBA the \ncontaminants most likely to cause problems are antimony, cadmium, copper, molybdenum, zinc \n 13\nand chloride. As the ash undergoes carbonation, zinc and lead will cease to be an issue but will be \nreplaced by sulphate. \n \n Certain MSW waste streams contain high proportions of these contaminants and it might be \nworth considering whether the likely changes in waste management practices could result in an \nincreased diversion of these waste streams from landfill. In the case of energy from waste mass \nburn (EfWMB), much of the organic and combustible fraction of the waste will be lost from the \nwaste mass (primarily carbon in its many forms) although any metals in these fractions may well \nbe retained. It is only when certain waste fractions are removed from a waste stream (as might \nhappen in the sorting and mechanical treatment stage of MBT) that whole waste fractions will be \nremoved from the final residue. Contaminants within the waste entering an EfWMB will be \npartitioned between the IBA and the APC and fly ash generated. Given the concentrating effects of \ncombustion (in relation to non-combustible fractions) and the change in oxidation state that results \nin some metals becoming more leachable, it is not entirely surprising that IBA performs least well \nin the modelling undertaken. \n \n Table 2 contains the percentage proportions of a selection of elemental contaminants in raw \nMSW. The figures take into account the composition of the waste fraction itself, and the relative \nproportion of that fraction within a typical household waste stream. It does not take into account \nthe relative leachability of the contaminants from each waste fraction nor does it consider any \nchanges to the leachability through waste treatment or combustion. However, Table 2 could be \nuseful as a guide for managing a specific site e.g. if cadmium is a concern, removal of the dense \nplastic waste stream could be a priority. \n \n 14\n For MBT residues, we might expect that many of the contaminants associated with paper, \nplastics, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and Waste Electrical & Electronic (WEE) goods will be \nremoved. Given that for MBT issues remain with lead, nickel and zinc, it is of some concern that \nthese elements are predominantly present within waste streams that should have been largely \nremoved. With respect to lead, nearly 50% of the total lead in MSW should have been removed. \nFor nickel the removal figure is 53%, and for zinc the figure is nearly 45% (see Table 2). Part of the \nreason why these contaminants remain a problem could be that much of the research on MBT \nresidues comes from continental Europe, while the compositional data from MSW has been \nderived solely from UK waste streams. In addition, it must be remembered that MBT residues are \nlikely to have a higher density than raw MSW and hence will contain a higher contaminant load \nwithin the same landfill volume. The fact that intensively composted MBT residues appear to have \nlower leachable metal content than less intensively composted MBT is not something that is readily \nunderstood, and may imply a fundamental difference in the overall performance of different MBT \nplants. \n \nOrganic Species \n \n The understanding of the origins of some of the trace organics within leachate (which have \nnot been modelled in this study) and landfill gas remains poor for many species. Certain trace \norganics such as mecoprop that is present in nearly all MSW landfills is probably one of the best \nunderstood, and is thought to originate from green waste (grass cuttings) and empty (or partially \nempty) herbicide containers. Mecoprop along with a number of other organic species appears \n 15\nroutinely in leachate samples primarily because they do not degrade anaerobically; and they are \nnot volatile and hence do not partition into the landfill gas phase. \n \n There is a very clear advantage in subjecting these contaminants (in the waste that they exist \nin) to an aerobic degradation period prior to placing them in to a landfill. Other contaminants, such \nas heavily chlorinated solvents, will degrade only in anaerobic conditions. However, these groups \nof compounds tend to be more volatile and will partition into the landfill gas phase. \n \nMeasuring Equilibrium Status \n \n One of the objectives of this work was to define a method for assessing when a site can be \nregarded as having achieved equilibrium status. This research has shown that this is a complex \nissue and one that will, in part, be based on the specific design of a landfill and upon its local \nhydrogeological regime. Furthermore, the criteria used to judge the impact on groundwater will \nalmost certainly not be the Drinking Water Standard (DWS) that has been used for the comparative \nmodelling that has been reported in this document. Under the Water Framework Directive [16] it is \nlikely that groundwater quality criteria will be developed for specific groundwater bodies or \nclasses of groundwater body. Furthermore, the revised Groundwater Directive [17] may include a \nchange in the way the discharge of Listed substances is regulated. These may change the way \ncompletion will be judged and may have a marked impact on the completion time or equilibrium \nstatus of a landfill. \n \n 16\n Leachate quality and an assessment of the hydraulic performance of a site, coupled with \nlong-term monitoring data from the site remains the only viable means of assessing completion \ncriteria at present. This will have to be addressed on a site-specific basis as it is clear that no \nuniform standard will work in each and every case.  \n \n For sites where flushing has been undertaken over the entire landfill area it is likely that \nmuch of the waste will have achieved a reasonably high L\/S ratio, and while there are bound to be \nareas that have (due to short circuiting) received less flushing than others, on the whole, the \nresidual emissions are likely to be acceptable. For sites where there has been less flushing, or \nflushing is restricted to certain areas of the site, then an investigation of the leaching properties of \nthe waste may be warranted. The leach tests defined for the WAC characterisation testing will be \nappropriate tests, and the degree of variance between samples and comparison between the leach \ntest data and existing leachate quality will provide an indication as to whether the whole site has \nreached equilibrium status or whether water flow through the waste has been channelled in very \nspecific areas. \n \n The fact remains that it is easy to measure leachate concentrations. What is needed is a \nmeans of measuring the flux of contaminants migrating from the site. Only when we are in a \nposition to measure the flux can we properly judge the equilibrium status in a way that does not \nrequire a great deal of conservatism. \n \n 17\nCONCLUSIONS \n This study has examined the municipal solid waste streams that the UK will most probably \ngenerate following the implementation of the Landfill Directive requirements to reduce \nbiodegradable waste from going to landfill and the requirements for waste pre-treatment. The \nproperties of the residues undergoing the most likely processes were investigated via a literature \nsearch and an assessment made via modelling of the probable management times these residues \nwould require within a landfill environment. A re-evaluation of these properties in light of \nemerging knowledge, for example on pre-treatment aspects, may show whether such aspects bring \nus any closer to equilibrium status or further from it. \n \n Each process investigated generates a residue that will need to be landfilled and there is a \nlikelihood that at times the products generated by these processes (e.g. MBT compost, or refuse \nderived fuel (RDF) material) may be out of specification, or in quantities greater than the demand, \nand hence these may also need to be landfilled. \n \n On the whole those processes that involve the combustion of wastes are shown to lengthen \nthe period of time taken for the landfill to reach equilibrium status. This is partially due to the \nhigher densities of the wastes resulting from combustion and hence the higher amount of metals \nand salts that can be disposed off within the same landfill void space. However, the same \nargument cannot be applied to intensively composted MBT residues which, despite their higher \ndensity, give the best performance waste residues considered. Interestingly, these MBT residues \nthat result from intense composting perform as well as, but no better than, raw MSW except that \n 18\nthey give the same performance while possessing a higher density, and therefore represent a better \nuse of the void space within a landfill. \n \n Leaching processes can be accelerated by the flushing of landfills with either recirculated, \nbut treated, leachate, or the infiltration of additional volumes of water. Other processes that show \npromising results at full scale were discussed, including landfill aeration and recirculation with \nnitrified leachate. \n \n The modelling was restricted to those processes that are readily modelled (even if the model \nparameters are uncertain). There remain a number of landfill processes and management practices \n(such as nitrate injection and air injection) that are the subject of interest world-wide but as yet \nhave not been developed to the extent that the processes have rate constants. Air injection in \nparticular, shows promising results in reducing the emissions from landfill with marked \nimprovement in leachate quality.  It is likely that modelling the effectiveness of these processes will \nbe forthcoming in the very near future. Further work is required to examine more critically the \nsensitivity to baseline assumptions, such as Co, hydrogeological settings and kappa values. This can \nonly happen once more data values are available. \n \n While this study does not provide the answers to how the landfill aftercare period may be \nshortened sufficiently to attain sustainable development criteria i.e. achieving equilibrium within \ndecades rather than centuries, it does take a step in the right direction and identifies where \nsignificant progress can be made towards achieving sustainable landfill and equilibrium status. It \nis clear that until such time as landfill sites achieves this status, risk assessment will be required. A \nsensitivity analysis of the baseline assumptions and data underpinning the modelling work is \n 19\nrequired. This was beyond the scope of our study but it could lead to the development of \nequilibrium criteria. A full technical and economic reappraisal of techniques that demonstrably \naccelerate waste decomposition processes is justified on the basis of modelled results presented in \nthis study.  \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe modelling work on which this paper is built was jointly funded by the Environment Agency \nfor England and Wales and ESART.
