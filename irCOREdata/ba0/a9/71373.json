Introduction \n Thermal data from active lava flows are required to test and help refine cooling models \nof lava and related fluid dynamic models (see review by Griffiths, 2000). While remote sensing \nmethods have considerable potential for regular monitoring of thermal budgets of active lava \nflows (e.g. Wooster et al., 1997), the resolution of current satellite imagery means that they \ncannot yet generate the temperature data required to help refine the next generation of lava flow \nmodels. In this paper we review some of the limitations of satellite imagery and assess the \nusefulness of alternative methods of collecting temperature data. We then describe a series of \nmeasurements made on active lava flows on Kilauea using hand-held infrared radiometers and \nuse these measurements to determine the minimum number of thermal components required to \nanalyse satellite thermal data from active lava flows. We report surface and internal temperature \nmeasurements of lava tubes, together with surface temperature measurements of tumuli and other \nfeatures that characterise different components of active flow fields.  \n \n2. Temperature measurements of active lava flows \n The temperatures of active lava flows and lakes can be measured from the ground, from \nthe air and from space. The techniques involved are varied when carrying out measurements on \nthe ground, but restricted to the detection of infrared radiation on airborne and satellite \nplatforms. Using different techniques and platforms offers the opportunity of collecting data over \na wide range of temporal and spatial scales. \n  \n2.1. Air and space borne measurements \n Surface temperatures of active flows and lava lakes have been determined from satellites \nand from aircraft (e.g. Bonneville et al., 1985; Oppenheimer and Rothery, 1989, 1991; Rothery \net al., 1988; Oppenheimer, 1991; Flynn and Mouginis-Mark, 1992; Realmuto et al., 1992; \n           4\nMouginis-Mark et al., 1994; Flynn et al., 1994; Harris et al., 1995, 1999). Satellite images have \nthe advantage over aircraft-based systems of regularity of cover (a return period of 16 days for \nLandsat, 6 hours for NOAA AVHRR, 16 days for Terra ASTER and 2 days for Terra MODIS). \nAlthough the spatial resolution of commonly used ~8 to 14 \u00b5m thermal infrared data from \nsatellites (ranging from 90 m for ASTER to 1 km for AVHRR) is too poor to be of value for \ncertain aspects of lava flow modelling, satellite remote sensing methods will undoubtedly be of \nimmense value in hazard assessment during future eruptions (Francis and Rothery, 2000). This is \nparticularly apparent as the newest satellites (Ikonos, and Hyperion on EO-1) now offer metre \nscale resolution and hyperspectral data. \n Airborne surveys generally have a better spatial resolution than satellite data, and they \nhave been used successfully to map lava tubes, tumuli and other thermal and morphological units \non active flow fields (Realmuto et al., 1992; Rothery and Pieri, 1993). However, surveys using \nthermal imaging systems are too expensive to be used routinely, and the resolution (typically \napproximately 6 m) is, in most cases, too coarse to measure accurately the temperatures of the \ncore, crust or any other part of an active lava flow. \n One of the main complications with the interpretation of remotely sensed thermal data is \nthe presence of different surface temperatures within the areas imaged by individual pixels. Each \ndata number corresponds to the integrated radiance from the area of the pixel rather than the \nactual temperature of any one component within it. For pixels including two thermal components \n(of estimated relative areal proportions), temperatures can be determined by the use of the dual \nband technique (e.g. Dozier, 1981; Matson and Dozier, 1981; Rothery et al., 1988; Pieri et al., \n1990; Oppenheimer, 1991; Oppenheimer et al., 1993). However, a common scenario in images \nobtained for volcanic monitoring is the presence of at least three thermal components within a \npixel (a \u2018cold\u2019 background and a lava lake or flow comprising cooled crust and hotter surface \ncracks), necessitating a three component model (Harris et al., 1997; Wooster and Rothery, 1997; \nWooster et al., 1997; Harris et al., 1999). This increases the number of unknown parameters \n           5\nwhich must be estimated for a unique solution (Harris et al., 1999). For eruption monitoring \nusing low resolution images, temperatures are normally assumed in order to obtain the areal \nextent of thermal anomalies (Harris et al., 1997, 1998), and thus alternative thermal data could \nbe of great value for increasing the accuracy of this technique. \n \n2.2. Ground-based measurements \n The temperature of lava flows is commonly measured using thermocouples (e.g. \nArchambault and Tanguy, 1976; Lipman and Banks, 1987; Wolfe et al., 1988; Mangan et al., \n1993; Pinkerton, 1993; Neal et al., 1988) and, when appropriate precautions are taken, a \nprecision of \u00b11 \u02daC is possible. However, the slow response times of thermocouples (Lipman and \nBanks, 1987; Pinkerton, 1993) limit the number of accurate measurements that can be made at \nany locality. Thermocouples are also very difficult to use in many situations (e.g. rapidly moving \nlava in large channels or tubes). Consequently, few systematic studies of temporal and spatial \nchanges in the temperatures of lava flows have been made, an exception being the \ncomprehensive study by Lipman and Banks (1987). \n Optical pyrometers (Ault et al., 1961; Swanson, 1973) have been used during the past 40 \nyears to measure temperatures during eruptions. More accurate temperatures, and improved \nspatial resolution, have been obtained using infrared \u2018Hotshot\u2019 pyrometers (e.g. Lipman and \nBanks, 1987). On lava flows, they can be used to measure the temperature of the crust or, if it is \nexposed, the incandescent interior. When rapid convection or vigorous degassing are taking \nplace, for example on active lava lakes and in fire fountains (e.g. Lipman and Banks, 1987), \ninstruments of this type can measure temperatures of the hottest parts of the lava. The main \nlimitations of these instruments are their slow response time (30 seconds for one reading) and \nthat they are sensitive only to temperatures above 500 \u02daC.  \n The above problems can be reduced by collecting quenched samples and determining \nthe pre-quench temperature using geothermometry (Helz and Thornber, 1987; Mangan et al., \n           6\n1993; Cashman et al., 1999). This method permits internal temperatures of lava flows to be \ndetermined if quenched samples from the highest temperature zones within the flow can be \ncollected. However, due to the difficulties of collecting samples from different zones within \nflows, geothermometry permits measurements to be made for only a small proportion of any \nflow. In addition, the errors can be significant (\u00b18 to 10 \u02daC), even for lavas for which accurate \ngeothermometric calibration data exist. There is, therefore, a need for ground-based remote \nsensing methods for the collection of temperature data from active lava flows.  \n A Geophysical and Environmental Research (GER) multispectral dual beam \nspectroradiometer has been used by Flynn and Mouginis-Mark (1992, 1994) and Flynn et al. \n(1993) to measure temperatures of a lava lake and of lava flows. This instrument permits the use \nof multiple bands and hence can provide very useful thermal data which can be solved for 2 or 3 \nthermal components. However, it has a scan time of 30 s and rapid temperature fluctuations can \nsaturate the instrument, potentially resulting in data loss during important periods of channel \ndevelopment (Flynn and Mouginis-Mark, 1994). \n The instruments we used were Cyclops C330 and C52 infrared radiometers, developed by \nMinolta\/Land (Table 1). They are well suited for work on active lava flows because they are \ncompact, light (800 g), robust and easy to operate in adverse conditions. They can be hand held \nor tripod mounted and rapid measurements (~1 s-1) can be made. They have a single lens reflex \nviewfinder with an ~10\u02da field of view and a smaller measuring field of view (1\u02da for the C330; \n0.33\u02da for the C52). Both instruments can readily be connected to a dedicated controller and data \nlogger. Their operational wavelengths are within windows of high atmospheric transmittance and \nonly two instruments are required to cover the entire range of temperatures encountered on \nvolcanoes. Precisions of order 6 \u02daC (Table 1) are claimed if the correct emissivities are used. The \ninstruments have previously been used to estimate temperatures in Strombolian vents, lava lakes, \nfumaroles and lava flows (Oppenheimer and Rothery, 1989, 1991; Oppenheimer, 1991; \nOppenheimer et al., 1993; Rothery et al., 1995; Harris, 1998). Hon et al. (1994) used a C330 \n           7\nradiometer in conjunction with a number of thermocouples at different depths within a pahoehoe \nflow on Kilauea, Hawai'i to investigate cooling and crustal thickening rates. However, there have \nbeen no detailed, systematic measurements using these instruments of the temporal and spatial \nchanges in the surface temperatures of active lava flows.  \n In this paper, we present the results of a study of surface temperature variations of lava \nflowing in channels and through tubes on the South East Rift Zone, Kilauea (Figure 1). We also \npresent surface temperature measurements of different components of lava flows on this flow \nfield made during two different periods (January to February 1990, and September 1994). The \narea was particularly suitable because of easy access to different parts of the flow field and \nminimal degassing of fumes during both measuring periods. \n  \n3. Sources of error in radiometer surveys \n  Accurate temperature measurements using radiometers can be made only if appropriate \nemissivities are used for each type of surface being measured and for each instrument (Salisbury \nand D'Aria, 1992; Flynn et al., 1993). Precautions must also be taken to minimise absorption by \nvolcanic gas and scattering by particulate matter (Oppenheimer and Rothery, 1989). Additional \npotential sources of error include variations in solar radiation contributions (Flynn et al., 1993), \nfields of view that include more than one thermal component, and inappropriate viewing angles. \nTo assess the importance of these errors, a series of measurements was carried out on active \nflows in the South East Rift Zone between September 12 and 24, 1994. These measurements \ncomplement laboratory measurements of the emissivity of crustal material from the 1990 \neruption. \n \n3.1. Emissivity of lava \nA range of emissivities are currently used for basalt. At wavelengths corresponding to the C52 \nradiometer (0.8 to 1.1 \u00b5m) these include 0.5 to 0.9 (Rothery et al., 1988), 0.95 to 0.97 (Crisp et \n           8\nal., 1990), >0.995 (Flynn et al., 1993) and 1.0 (Pieri et al., 1990). In view of the large uncertainty \nin basalt emissivity between 0.8 and 1.1 \u00b5m, and because this was the instrument used for all \nhigh temperature (>600 \u02daC) measurements, we carried out laboratory measurements of the \nemissivity of Hawaiian lava by heating a sample of Hawaiian pahoehoe in a horizontal tube \nfurnace. The surface temperature of the sample was measured using the C52 radiometer and a \npreviously calibrated Comark Cr-Al thermocouple (Jones, 1992). The furnace construction, \ncoupled with a small diameter tube (2.5 cm) and large sample size (1.5 cm diameter) minimised \nreflection from the furnace walls. Temperatures were recorded at 50 \u02daC intervals between 600 \u02daC \nand 990 \u02daC. The best agreement between the thermocouple and the C52 data was obtained when \nthe emissivity selector was set at 1.00 (Figure 2). This was the emissivity we used for all C52 \nmeasurements. For the C330 we used an emissivity of 0.95 as also employed by Harris et al. \n(1998). \n \n3.2. Effects of sunlight \nThe radiance contribution from reflected sunlight can be seen as a peak at 0.554 \u00b5m in multi-\nspectral radiometers (Flynn et al., 1993) and it can influence apparent temperatures measured \nusing the C52 which measures radiance in the range 0.8 to 1.1 \u00b5m. The effect was seen clearly \nduring a series of measurements on a small active vent on September 23, 1994 where \ntemperatures measured in diffuse sunlight were between 8 and 36 \u02daC higher than the stable \ntemperature of 1087 \u02daC measured when the sun was obscured by cloud. These observations \nconfirm the need to ensure that measurements using this instrument are not made in sunlight and, \nideally, they should be carried out at night. All C52 measurements reported here were carried out \neither under overcast conditions, or at dusk. \n \n3.3. Effects of viewing distance \nIn common with other remote sensing methods used on lava flows, the area being viewed by a \n           9\nradiometer may include more than one thermal component. This can be reduced by minimising \nthe viewing distance to the target. The relationship between viewing area, distance and viewing \nangle (the angle between the line of site and the normal of the surface being viewed) are shown \nfor both Cyclops radiometers in Figure 3. During one set of measurements carried out in \nSeptember 1994 with the C52 radiometer, the surface temperature of lava emerging from a small \nvent on Kilauea was measured at different viewing distances (Figure 4). The data show a clear \nreduction in apparent temperatures with increased viewing distance (-1.9 \u02daC m-1), a result of the \nhottest parts of the flow becoming smaller fractions of the measured area at larger viewing \ndistances (increased effective target diameters). This effect is a function of the cooling and \nsurface deformation history of the flow before and during eruption from the vent. It is also \ndependent on the surface roughness of the flow; thus the value of -1.9 \u02daC m-1 can only be used \nfor other flows with similar surface textures and pre-eruption histories to the measured flow. For \nall measurements on active flows presented here, the viewing distance was less than 8 m, and for \nmany measurements it was less than 2 m. The viewing angle did not exceed 40\u02da from the \nperpendicular and was, in most cases, between 0\u02da and 20\u02da.  \n \n3.4. Comparison between thermocouple and radiometer measurements \nThe high thermal gradients in most lava flows dictate that surface temperatures measured \nusing radiometers are considerably lower than the maximum internal temperatures that can be \nmeasured using thermocouples unless the flow is thermally well mixed. When measurements \nwere made of high effusion rate flows close to a tube exit on Kilauea (September 20, 1994), \nsurface temperatures measured using the C52 radiometer were up to 20 \u02daC lower than maximum \nstable internal temperatures recorded using a previously calibrated Cr\/CrAl thermocouple. \n We conclude that if appropriate emissivities are used, the viewing distance minimised, \nand the measurements carried out in the absence of sunlight and fumes, then temperatures \nobtained with the C52 radiometer are within \u00b110 \u02daC of the maximum surface temperatures of the \n           10\nmeasured area. Errors will be greater for the C330 (see Table 1); however this was used only \nduring traverses over the surface of cooled crust (mostly <200 \u02daC ) above lava tubes and tumuli. \n \n4. Measurements from the South East Rift Zone, Kilauea \n When the first set of measurements were made (January 1990), lava flowed out of \nKupaianaha lava lake through a single tube and into the sea near Kupapua Point (Figure 1). This \nwas typical of activity during Episode 48 on the South East Rift Zone of Kilauea. On January 13, \na surface 'a'a flow broke out of the tube and headed southeast (Figure 1, localities 1a and b). \nAfter a pause in the eruption at the beginning of February, extrusion resumed and a new \nbreakout, approximately 2 km from Kupaianaha, also flowed southeast before splitting into a \nnumber of smaller flows, 3.5 km downflow (Figure 1, localities 4, 5, 6, and 7). The proximal \nparts of the new primary channel rapidly tubed over, as did the upper parts of some of the \nsubsidiary branching flows. The development of the 1990 Kalapana flow field is described in \ndetail by Mattox et al. (1993). During 1990, temperatures were measured using the C52 and \nC330 radiometers at Kupaianaha lava lake and on a number of active flows in channels and \ntubes. In addition, two traverses were carried out across part of the January 1990 flowfield. \n After a brief period of eruptive activity up-rift from Kupaianaha in November 1991, \nEpisode 48 ended in February 1992. In March 1992, new lavas emerged from the western flank \nof Pu'u 'O'o. A small shield was constructed and this was the source of lavas that reached the sea \n6 \u2013 10 km SW of Kalapana (Heliker et al., 1998; Kauahikaua et al., 1998). Temperature \nmeasurements were made using the same instruments on a number of small lava flows in \nSeptember 1994, both above and below Pali Uli. \n \n4.1. Temperature of lava in Kupaianaha lava lake \n Vigorous convection and mild fountaining within Kupaianaha lava lake occasionally \nbrought the hottest fraction of lava to the surface, allowing temperatures to be measured using \n           11\nthe C52 radiometer. A maximum temperature of 1153 \u02daC was recorded (January 19, 1990), \nwhich is thought to be a reasonable reflection of the internal lava temperature. This can be \ncompared with temperatures obtained from glass geothermometry (Helz and Thornber, 1987). \nUsing this technique, Helz et al. (1991) calculated an eruption temperature of between 1155 \u00b18 \n\u02daC and 1157 \u00b18 \u02daC for lava in Kupaianaha from May 1989 to January 1990. \n \n4.2. Temperatures within tubes \n The opportunity to study and monitor flowing lava within tubes is often limited by the \nsporadic nature of \u2018skylights\u2019 in the tube roof and by the potential hazards when making \nmeasurements or collecting samples through skylights. Using an optical pyrometer and \nthermocouples, Swanson (1973) and Tilling et al. (1987) recorded temperatures in lava tubes in \nthe range 1130 to 1165 \u02daC from the 1971 to 1972 eruption of Mauna Ulu. However, Kauahikaua \net al. (1998) recorded temperatures of only ~1080 \u02daC in tubes from Pu'u 'O'o in 1994. These \ntemperatures, obtained by optical pyrometer, were considerably lower than those of 1154 \u00b13\u02daC \ndetermined by geothermometry for the core of these flows (Heliker et al., 1998). \n Skylights were present within the established tube system on Kilauea\u2019s South East Rift \nZone during January and February 1990 at varying distances from the Kupaianaha vent. Using \nthe C52 radiometer, temperatures of lava flowing within tubes were measured through two of \nthese skylights (localities 3 and 6, Figure 1). Figure 5 shows data collected at locality 3, a \nskylight with a diameter of ~1.5 m, 8 km from Kupaianaha, over a period of 4 minutes, on \nFebruary 21. The radiometer was mounted on a tripod in order to monitor the same spatial point \nas the lava flowed through the measurement field of view. It was oriented to record surface \ntemperatures as far up the tube as possible (a measurement distance of ~2.5 m, giving an \neffective target diameter of ~1.8 cm), where cooling due to radiant heat loss through the skylight \nwould be minimised. \n The data show fluctuations of surface temperature between 1114 and 1138 \u02daC over the \n           12\nmonitoring period, reflecting either real temperature differences or changes in the amount of \nthermal radiation absorbed by volcanic gases. Real temperature differences could indicate the \nperiodic disruption or thinning of a semi-continuous, cooled skin on the surface of the lava. This \ninterpretation is supported by observations of sheared bubbles on the surface whose interiors \nwere a visibly brighter orange (and thus hotter) than the surrounding lava. This observation was \nmade in all the tubes monitored. \n The maximum surface temperature within any part of the tube system (1138 \u02daC) was \nrecorded on a number of occasions, but is 15 \u02daC lower than our estimate of maximum \ntemperatures in the lava pond. However, there is no evidence of complete thermal mixing within \nthe observed tubes. The core temperatures of lava within the tubes would therefore be higher \nthan the measured surface values. Higher core temperatures are also indicated by a minimum \nrecorded temperature for lava flowing into the ocean during this period of 1145 \u02daC (Heltz et al., \n1991). \n The surface temperature distribution across an active lava channel contained within a \ntube was recorded through another skylight at a distance of 10 km from Kupaianaha (locality 6). \nThe data collected (Figure 6) show that the pasty, slower moving lava adjacent to the margins of \nthe tube was cooler than the central part of the flow surface, in agreement with similar data \ncollected by Flynn and Mouginis-Mark (1994). \nA lava surface temperature of 1020 \u02daC was measured at a tube exit, at Kupapau Point \n(Figure 1), in January 1990. This low temperature in the distal parts of the tube results from the \nreduced flow velocities in the tube with increasing distance from Kupaianaha and the consequent \nincreased thermal boundary layer thickness on top of the lava. The temperature difference \nbetween the core and the surface therefore increased from ~3 \u02daC at Kupaianaha to ~125 \u02daC at the \ntube mouth, 12 km from Kupaianaha. \n \n           13\n4.3. Axial surface temperature measurements along the main channel  \n The behaviour of lava as it flows from a tube mouth to a flow front has been studied \nextensively in the field, particularly on Kilauea, Hawai'i (Macdonald, 1953; Greeley, 1971, \n1987; Swanson, 1973; Peterson and Tilling, 1980; Fink and Zimbelman, 1986; Lipman and \nBanks, 1987; Rowland and Walker, 1990) and Mt. Etna, Sicily (Pinkerton and Sparks, 1976; \nChester et al., 1985; Pinkerton, 1987; Kilburn and Lopes, 1988). However, apart from the study \nby Lipman and Banks (1987), these do not provide any data on the temperatures of the different \nareas within flows (e.g. exposed core and cooled crust) as a channel advances. By collecting \nsurface temperature data along the axis of a channel we have been able to investigate the \ntemperatures of different types of flow surface and also calculate down-flow cooling rates. \n Surface temperatures were recorded along the axis of a stable, tube-fed, channelled 'a'a \nlava flow, 9 km from Kupaianaha (locality 4, Figure 1). The flow contained a well developed \nchannel ~2.5 m wide, with a central surface velocity of 0.4 m s-1, confined between stable rubbly \nlevees (Figure 7a) similar to those described by Greeley (1971, 1972) and Lipman and Banks \n(1987). Temperatures were measured using the C52 radiometer at 2 m intervals over a 46 m \ndistance along the central portion of the flow (Figure 7b), and the highest temperatures measured \nover monitoring periods of 20 s recorded. The distance between the radiometer and the centre of \nthe channel was 2 \u00b1,0.5 m in all cases, and the effective diameter of the target area measured by \nthe C52 was <1.4 cm. The time taken to complete the profile was approximately 20 minutes, \nduring which there was no significant change in the condition of the flow surface along the \nmeasured length of the channel. The data can therefore be considered to represent an \ninstantaneous thermal profile of this section of the flow. \n Three distinct thermal components were observed in the channel. On the surface of the \nflow, large plates of lava cooled and thickened with distance from the tube mouth, forming a \nmedial crust. Between the plates, regions of incandescent skin were locally sheared to reveal the \ntop of the flow's central core. The temperature of the top of the crust is the lower temperature \n           14\nrecorded (the crossed squares in Figure 7b). The systematic decrease in the temperature of these \npoints with distance reflects the radiant cooling and consequent thickening of the lava plates. \nThe significantly higher temperatures recorded at other points are a result of measuring areas \nwhere the crust had fractured and exposed varying amounts of the hotter flow interior. However, \nthe small fields of view of the C52 maximise the probability that the target area was filled with \nrelatively thermally homogeneous lava surfaces. Thus, we infer that the elevated temperatures at \n18, 30 and >42 m could represent the temperature at the base of the crust (i.e. a cooled surface \nskin), and the highest value at 28 m represents the upper part of the central core. \n Fitting a linear cooling rate to the data shown by crossed squares in Figure 7b gives an \napparent average cooling rate for the crust of 7.1 \u02daC m-1. Alternatively, using the exponential \nbest fit curve shown in Figure 7b, the initial cooling rate of the flow surface was 8.3 \u02daC m-1 \nwhich decreased to 5.8 \u02daC m-1 40 m from the tube mouth. Comparable temperature \nmeasurements were made on the western subsidiary flow at a similar distance below the \nbifurcation in the primary channel (locality 5, Figure 1). Here, the flow had similar dimensions \nand flow rate to those given in Figure 7, and the measurements were carried out within 5 hours \nof those made at locality 4. However, lava at the surface of the centre of the channel cooled from \n1068 \u02daC at the tube exit to 900 \u02daC at 10 m down-flow, an average temperature decrease of 16.8 \n\u02daC m-1.  \n \n4.4. Temperatures across an active channel \n Characteristic temperatures of different parts of lava flows were investigated by making \ntemperature measurements along transects across an active flow. Six transects were carried out \non a distal channel at locality 7 (Figure 1), 10 km from Kupaianaha, which had a maximum lava \nsurface velocity of 0.4 m s-1. Temperatures were measured using the C52 radiometer at viewing \ndistances ranging from 1 to 4.75 m (corresponding to target areas with effective diameters \nbetween 0.6 and 4 cm). The transects were measured at intervals of 10 m, from the tube mouth \n           15\n(at 0 m, approximately 200 m from the active flow front, Figure 8a) to 50 m down-flow (Figure \n8f). \n The 0 m transect gives temperatures measured across the end of the fully roofed-over \nchannel. The higher temperatures towards the centre of the crust confirm that this is the youngest \nand thinnest part of the roof. The low temperatures at the edges of the 10 and 20 m transects \nshow how the tube at this location was being formed from the gradual inwards growth of lateral \nlevees, in the classic \u2018zipper\u2019 fashion (Greeley, 1971). Hotter material gradually appears in the \ncentre of the flow as the surface moves away from the conductive cooling of the tube roof. Since \nthis surface is now cooling radiatively, the exact mechanism for the apparent increase in \ntemperature is not obvious. However, it may be a result of the conductively cooled upper flow \nboundary layer being thinned as the surface accelerates, bringing core-temperature material \ncloser to the surface. The transects at 30, 40 and 50 m from the tube mouth demonstrate how the \nsurface cools, creating a crust which initially forms in the centre of the flow (where shear \nstresses are smallest). Narrow, stationary lateral crusts were also observed. \n These data further support the division of the lava surface into different thermal \ncomponents. At this locality, the highest temperatures recorded (~1000 \u02daC) represent the \ntemperature of the upper part of the core. Radiative cooling of hot, exposed lava rapidly formed \na skin at ~900 \u02daC, which corresponds to the visco-elastic skin of Hon et al. (1994). Further \ncooling produced the rigid, solid crust at temperatures of about 630 \u02daC. This has also been \nrecognised by Flynn et al. (1993) for the surface of Kupaianaha lava lake. \n Using the C330, temperatures have also been recorded across the levee and surrounding \narea of an active flow as it emerged from a tube at 7 km from Kupaianaha (locality 2 in Figure \n1). The ranges of temperatures measured have been combined with high temperature C52 data \nand are summarised in Table 2. The temperatures of the old pahoehoe flow surface (on which the \nlevee had formed) and the outer edge of the levee are thought to reflect remnant heat from their \nemplacement and the effect of conductive heating from the active channel. Temperatures \n           16\nrecorded from the inner levee edge, adjacent to the active channel, are more likely to be \ndominated by the absorption and reflection of radiant heat from the channel. Thus, measured \ntemperatures of inner levee walls will be a strong function of the size and surface state of the \nchannel. \n \n4.5. Temperatures across lava flow fields \n Surface temperatures over lava flow fields range from background temperatures (<50 \u02daC) \nto those of molten lava (>1000 \u02daC). Detection of thermal anomalies can help to locate the \nposition of active lava tubes, which play a major role in the development of many pahoehoe (e.g. \nPeterson and Tilliing 1980) and 'a'a (e.g. Calvari and Pinkerton, 1998, 1999) lava flow fields. \nLava tube monitoring is critical to understanding and predicting the growth of these flow fields. \nRecent studies have successfully utilised several geophysical techniques, e.g. very low frequency \nelectromagnetic induction and magnetometry (Zablocki, 1978; Jackson et al., 1987; Kauahikaua \net al., 1990; Hon et al., 1994) to detect lava tubes. Thermal anomalies of up to 24 \u02daC greater than \nthe temperature of the surrounding lavas were measured during an overflight with a thermal \ninfrared multispectral scanner (TIMS) by Realmuto et al. (1992). To complement the TIMS \nstudy, Realmuto et al. (1992) also carried out transects with a hand-held radiation thermometer \nover the Kapa'ahu lava tube on 22 May 1989. The average of these measurements was 42 \u00b0C, \nwhich was in agreement with the TIMS derived temperatures of 38 to 44 \u00b0C. Thermal anomolies \ndue to lava tubes were also detected in thematic mapper (TM) scenes by Flynn et al. (1994), but \nthey were of lower magnitude (~4 \u00b0C) than those shown in the TIMS data (Realmuto et al., \n1992). Here we describe similar traverses taken across pahoehoe flow fields during 1990 and \n1994. \n Using the C330 radiometer, surface temperatures were measured across a traverse line \n(locality 1a, Figure 1) on a flow field that had been emplaced two weeks previously and that fed \nan active flow front approximately 1 km downslope. The radiometer was directed vertically \n           17\ndownwards from ~60 cm above the surface, producing an effective target diameter of ~1 cm as \nthe operator walked across the traverse. A thermal anomaly at approximately 250 \u02daC (a distance \nof 120 m from the beginning of the traverse line, Figure 9a) coincided with independently \nmeasured resistivity anomalies and is interpreted to indicate the presence of a tube. The elevated \n\u2018background\u2019 temperatures are due to the area being dominantly recent flows and still relatively \nhot. \n A second line was established over the same flow field 1 km upslope of the previous line \n(locality 1b). The main part of this flow field had been emplaced more than 2 weeks prior to the \nsurvey. This traverse identified no marked thermal anomaly along the tube and flow field \ntransect (Figure 9b). Resistivity surveys identified an anomaly at 130 m, where the measured \nsurface temperature was 95 \u02daC. This is considered to be the position of a partially drained lava \ntube. The high temperature (130 \u02daC) at 80 m was caused by a viscous pahoehoe breakout in its \nfinal stages of cooling. A close examination of the flows in both traverses showed that the field \nwas composed of multiple compound pahoehoe units, some of which had clearly been erupted \nless than two weeks previously.  \n To complement this study, data were collected along a line across an active \npahoehoe flow field at the top of Pali Uli (Heliker et al., 1998) from three different stationary \npoints on September 24, 1994 (Figure 10). The C330 radiometer was used for all measurements, \nat a viewing distance of 250 m from the closest point on the line (producing effective target \ndiameters ~4.4 to ~6.2 m). The three datasets display broad similiarities with the highest \ntemperatures (~250 to ~300 \u02daC) being recorded from a tumulus at ~330 m, and the lowest \ntemperatures (~50 \u02daC) from old flows at the beginning of the transects and from the kipuka at \n~290 m. However, there are also differences of up to ~100 \u02daC at several points (e.g. at 80 and \n150 m) which suggest a sensitivity of the data to the viewing angle. The data collected by remote \nand walked traverses for different features across the flow field are summarised in Table 3. \n \n           18\n5. Discussion  \n Our measurements emphasise the difficulties in determining the thermal structure of lava \nflows. Although satellite images can provide simultaneously recorded measurements across an \nentire lava flow or field, their relatively low spatial resolution usually necessitates the \nincorporation of at least two thermal components into the interpretation of each pixel digital \nnumber. Thus, unless useful data are obtained at two wavelengths, temperature or spatial \ncoverage parameters must be estimated or ranges of results given. At the expense of not \nallowing simultaneous data collection from geographically separated areas, careful \nmeasurements using hand-held radiometers permit temperatures of individual thermal \ncomponents to be obtained. Thus, our temperature data can be used to improve the interpretation \nof satellite images by providing further control on the temperature ranges of different parts of \nlava flows.  \nOur measurements of active flows can be summarised by dividing a typical flow surface \ninto four thermal components, each of which covers a range of temperature values; core (>1050 \n\u00b0C), visco-elastic skin (~750 to ~900 \u00b0C), rigid solid crust (<750 \u00b0C) and flow margins (<175 \n\u00b0C). Unfortunately, the relative spatial coverage of each component cannot be inferred from our \npoint measurements and will vary with parameters such as distance from the tube mouth, local \ngradient and the flow history of the lava. \nOur thermal anomalies for lava tubes and tumuli (of order 100 \u00b0C) are considerably \ngreater than those reported by Realmuto et al. (1992) in TIMS data from the Kupaianaha \nflowfield in 1988 (anomalies of up to 15 \u00b0C, with the exception of those from skylights). This is \nlikely to be an effect of effective target area which, for the TIMS instrument, was several tens of \nsquare metres (Realmuto et al., 1992) and for our surveys, approximately one square metre. A \nsmall area of elevated temperature in our survey would thus represent a much larger proportion \nof the target area than in a TIMS image, producing a greater apparent temperature. \n           19\nThe efficiency of lava tubes in transporting lava long distances and generating extensive \nflowfields confirms that they are of great importance not only for hazard management but also \nfor understanding effusive volcanic processes on other planets (Keszthelyi, 1995; Sakimoto et \nal., 1997). The cooling rate of lava within tubes is commonly considered to be approximately 1 \n\u00b0C km-1 (Keszthelyi, 1995) although field measurements have suggested that down-tube cooling \nis not necessarily linear (Cashman et al., 1994). Our measurements of the surface temperature of \nlava within tubes were taken at two localities and are not sufficient to confirm a definitive \ncooling trend. However, assuming a lava pond temperature of 1158 \u00b0C, the data suggest an \napproximately linear cooling rate of the exposed core of ~2 \u00b0C km-1. \nSakimoto and Zuber (1998) argue that heat loss within lava tubes is rate limited. They \nthus assume that the upper flow surface in partly full tubes is at the same temperature as the \nother flow boundaries, implying a similar thickness thermal boundary layer. However, cooling \nof the flow surface will be accelerated under skylights and, although this is not thought to be \nsignificant for the flow as a whole (Keszthelyi, 1995), it may be sufficient to generate or help \nmaintain a surface skin. \nOur measurements through skylights also suggest that, perpendicular to the flow \ndirection, tubed flows have a different surface thermal profile compared with active channels in \nsubaerial flows. The higher temperatures measured at the margins of channels compared to their \ncentres is a consequence of hotter material being exposed to the surface as the crust is disrupted \nby shear. Thus, we infer that higher temperatures are measured in areas of the flow where the \nsurface is highly disrupted, for example by a rapid increase in gradient. Tubed flows have cooler \nmargins than centres; this reflects the increased importance of conductive heat loss through the \ntube walls compared with radiant heat loss from the surface. \nOur surveys across flowfields highlight the potential problems of using remote sensing \nwithout supplementary ground truth data. The surface temperatures we recorded across flows in \nthe latter stages of cooling were indistinguishable from those recorded over the surfaces of \n           20\nactive tubes. This implies that, in airborne or satellite images, features cannot be interpreted \nusing the anomaly magnitude alone and the spatial distribution of elevated temperature pixels \nmust be taken into account. The traverses also demonstrate the sensitivity of measured \ntemperatures (particularly the higher values) to the angle of observation. This is because \nelevated temperatures in some regions are the result of small areas of much higher temperature \nmaterial within the target area. It is likely that these are located in relatively deep cracks and \nthus visibile only from a viewing angle parallel to the cracks. This could have implications for \nany correlation between satellite images taken at different angles, for example on and off nadir. \nWithin a satellite image, the area covered by a pixel may include all of these components \nand a background. However, in some cases, certain thermal components may be safely neglected \nif they are not sufficiently hot to contribute to the radiance at the observed frequency (Rothery et \nal., 1988). Harris et al. (1998) provide a further example of ways of decreasing the number of \nunknown parameters for image interpretation. The authors recognised that the high temperature \ncomponent of the lava flow they imaged (within the cracks in the crust) was itself composed of \ntwo thermal components, corresponding to the uncooled molten lava and visco-elastic skin in \nTable 2. Citing unpublished 1.1 \u00b5m video data, Harris et al. (1998) described these components \nas a mesh of cooler filaments through which incandescent material was exposed. Assigning the \nmeasurements of Flynn and Mouginis-Mark (1992) to this surface (the filaments, comprising \n~96% of the area, at ~770 \u00b0C and the remaining 4% of the surface at ~1150 \u00b0C) allowed the \nauthors to calculate an effective integrated high temperature to use as a single component within \ntheir model. \nThis study demonstrates the value of data acquired from modern hand-held infrared \ndigital video cameras which represent the next generation of technology in the thermal \ninvestigation of lava flows (Pinkerton et al., 2000). Images captured by these systems combine \nsome of the advantages of space-borne systems (multiple, discrete, simultaneous measurements \ndistributed over a wide area and a rapid data capture rate) with those of the infrared radiometers \n           21\n(individual pixel targets which can be sufficiently small to cover only one thermal component). \nAs an example, the Inframetrics ThermaCAM PM190 system has a viewing angle of ~16\u00b0 and \nan image size of 252 \u00d7 239 pixels. For a viewing range of 2 m this produces an image \nrepresenting ~0.56 \u00d7 0.56 m with an individual pixel size of <5 mm2. Such images can be used \nto determine the range of surface temperatures and their spatial distribution, data which are \nimportant for numerical models of lava flows as well as for satellite image interpretation. The \ncombination of small pixel size and relatively large spatial coverage increases the possibility of \nmeasuring the maximum lava temperature (the core temperature, an essential parameter in \nnumerical models) during overturning or breakout events. \nThe increasing availability of portable instruments with high spatial resolution (infrared \nvideo cameras) and high spectral resolution (spectroradiometers) promotes rapid advances in \nfield measurements of the thermal properties of lava flows. In combination with similar \nadvances in satellite technology (decreasing pixel size, hyperspectral instruments), this should \nincrease accuracy in the interpretation of remotely sensed data and consequently improve hazard \nassessment and predictive models. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors wish to thank all staff of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory for their assistance and \nconstructive comments.

Ratios are given \nof temperatures measured by the C52 and a Comark Cr-Al thermocouple of a Hawaiian \npahoehoe sample heated in a horizontal tube furnace. The different symbols represent C52 \nmeasurements taken using different emissivity settings, as shown in the key. Results closest to \nthose of the thermocouple (i.e. a ratio of 1.00) were obtained using an emissivity of 1.00. \n \nFigure 3.

Temperatures recorded at different distances from an active vent at the eastern end of \nPali Uli on September 23, 1994 using the C52 radiometer. The extrapolated temperature of the \nlava surface at the vent is 1095 \u00b0C. \n \nFigure 5. Temperature measurements of the surface of a tubed lava flow carried out through a \nskylight (locality 13), with the C52 radiometer. The radiometer was tripod-mounted and \nrecorded temperatures from an area located at the centre of the flow. The temperature variations \nare due to hotter and colder portions of the lava flowing through the measuring area. \n           32\n \nFigure 6. Transverse surface temperature profile across a tube lava flow carried out with the C52 \nat locality 14. The data points can be described as taken of (a) lava adjacent to the tube wall, (b) \nsurface skin shear zone, (c) outer edge of central skin and (d) the centre of the flow surface. \nTemperatures given represent the maximum recorded over a 20 s interval. \n \nFigure 7. Along-flow temperature measurements carried out at locality 4 using the C52 \nradiometer. (a) Sketch showing the channelised flow investigated. Note how shearing of the \ncentral crustal plates exposed some areas of the upper layer of the flow interior. (b) Down-flow \ncooling profile taken along the centre of the flow from the main branch. The data can be \ninterpreted as evidence for the three separate thermal components observed on most lava flows; \ncrust, visco-elastic skin, and exposed core. A least squares exponential fit (the dotted line) has \nbeen calculated for the lowest temperature data points (those given as crossed squares) which are \nthought to represent radiative surface cooling and thickening of the crust. Data points above the \nline are measurements that include visco-elastic skin or, for the peak at 28 m, the upper part of \nthe core.  \n \nFigure 8. Transverse temperature profiles carried out with the C52 radiometer at locality 10, \ndemonstrating the development of a tube from an open channel by the growth of lateral stable \ncrust. Transect (a) is at the apex of the roof closure; Transect (f) is 50 m downstream. In (g), the \ndata are presented as a contour map. The hatched areas represent the sides of the channel where \nthe channel width was less than 2.8 m. \n \nFigure 9. (a) Temperature profile using the C330 Radiometer across a two week old flow field at \nlocality 12a. The thermal anomaly at 120 m indicated the surface position of an active tube. (b) \nTemperature profile across a flow field emplaced more than two weeks prior to the survey at \n           33\nlocality 12b. The thermal anomaly at 80 m is a recent surface flow; the active tube is situated at \n130 m. \n \nFigure 10. Traverses across the eastern end of the active flow field above Pali Uli, September 24, \n1994 carried out with the C330 radiometer. The data were collected along a 500 m transect \nacross the active flow field from three different viewing positions (shown by the different \nsymbols). All positions were ~250 m from the closest point on the line of the traverse. Arrowed \nfeatures are (o) old flows, (t) tumuli and (k) kipukas. \n"}
