Introduction\nIt is frequently argued that in the last 30 years the innovative advantage has moved from large,\nestablished enterprises to small and new firms, because new technologies have reduced the\nimportance of scale economies in many sectors (e.g., Meijaard, 2001). Also, an increasing degree of\nuncertainty in the world economy from the 1970s onwards has created more room for innovative\nentry (Audretsch and Thurik, 2001). A consequence of these developments is that the importance of\nnew and small firms for economic development has increased. Since the seminal work of Birch\n(1987), who stated that small and medium-sized enterprises create most of the new jobs, the interest\nin entrepreneurship and SMEs in relation to job creation has grown rapidly. Many studies have\nshown that SMEs do play an important role in job creation (e.g. Broersma and Gautier, 1997; Picot\nand Dupuy, 1998). Others state that this role is overestimated due to the high job destruction rate\namong SMEs (e.g. Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh, 1996). De Kok, de Wit and Suddle (2006) show\nthat small and medium-sized firms can be seen as the main source of employment growth in the\nNetherlands during the period 1993-1998.1 Roughly two\/third of net annual employment growth can\nbe attributed to small and medium-sized firms. In addition, the average annual net employment\ncreation rate is 2.4% for small firms, 1.2% for medium-sized firms and 0.7% for large firms during\nthe period mentioned. Verhoeven, Gibcus and de Jong-\u2018t Hart (2005) report that in the Netherlands,\n30% of total gross job creation in 2004 was accounted for by new-firm start-ups. These studies mark\nthe important contribution of new and small firms to economic development in modern economies.\nThe relationship between new firm formation and economic development is complex. When new\nbusinesses enter a market, they may have both direct and indirect effects on the economic\nperformance of the market they enter. The direct or immediate effect relates to the new jobs that are\ncreated in the new units at the start of business operations. The indirect effects occur some time after\nthe new firms have started and relate to the crowding-out of competitors (negative effect) and, still\n4later, to improved competitiveness of the industry induced by the increased competition of the new\nfirms (Fritsch and Mueller, 2004).\nThe present paper investigates the time lags related to the direct and indirect effects of new\nbusinesses on the economic performance of the market they enter. In particular, using a data base for\n40 regions in the Netherlands over the period 1988-2002, we examine the lag structure of the impact\nof new firms on employment change. When investigating the relation between new firm formation\nand economic development we realise that, besides the lag structure, at least two other aspects are of\nimportance. First, the relation may differ by sector of economic activity. It is generally well-known\nthat start-ups in manufacturing are quite different from start-ups in services, for instance in terms of\nthe amount of start-up capital required. Furthermore, the quality of start-up projects may differ\nbetween sectors (selection effect). Hence the impact of new firm formation on employment may\ndiffer as well. Second, the degree of urbanization may influence the relation as well. In areas where\nbusiness density is higher, agglomeration advantages and knowledge spillovers may also be higher,\nand hence the economic impact of new firms may be higher. Again, the quality of start-up projects\nmay differ between rural and urban areas (selection effect), for instance because highly skilled\nindividuals move to the cities in order to find employment. In this paper we also examine whether\nthe relation between new businesses and regional development differs by sector and by degree of\nurbanization.\nWe find that the maximum effect of new businesses on regional development is reached after about\nsix years. Our results also suggest that the overall employment impact of new-firm start-ups is\npositive but that the immediate employment effects may be small in the Netherlands. Furthermore,\nwe find that the employment impact of new firms is strongest in manufacturing and that the\nemployment impact of new firms is stronger in areas with a higher degree of urbanization.\n5The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the theory and earlier empirical\nevidence for the Netherlands. Section 3 describes our data base on start-ups and employment for the\nDutch regions while Section 4 deals with the model and methods that we use in our paper. In the last\nsections the results are presented and interpreted.\n2. Theory and earlier work\n2.1 Theory\nAs mentioned, when new businesses enter an industry, they may have both direct and indirect effects\non industry-wide economic performance. The direct effect relates to the new jobs that are created in\nthe new units at the start of business operations. The indirect effects relate to the effects the new\nbusinesses have on the incumbent firms in the market. There are several types of indirect effects\nwhich may be negative or positive. For instance, one may think of job destruction in the least\ncompetitive incumbent firms through increased competition of the new firms (negative effect). On\nthe other hand, there are also positive effects. Incumbents imitate innovations made by new firms.\nThe incumbent firms are also stimulated to innovate themselves. Furthermore, to resist the threat of\nstart-ups, incumbents lower their prices, which, in turn, increases demand for products and services\n(Verhoeven, 2004). For a more elaborate discussion of the direct and indirect effects of new firm\nformation we refer to Fritsch (2007).\nIn this study we will also investigate whether the relationship between business creation and\nemployment growth differs by sector. One might argue that a higher start-up rate has more impact in\nsectors with a higher innovation-intensity compared to non-innovative sectors. More intense\n6competition in innovative sectors may lead to a higher speed of technological progress, which in the\nlonger run may lead to higher growth in these sectors.\nAs mentioned, we also investigate whether the degree of urbanization influences the relation\nbetween new firms and employment growth. When many firms are located close to each other in\nheavily populated areas, positive agglomeration effects may emerge, e.g. access to a broader labour\nmarket, the sharing of research organizations and the easier diffusion of (tacit) knowledge (Werker\nand Athreye, 2004, p. 508). As knowledge spillovers tend to be localized, the new knowledge\ngenerated or induced by a given number of new firms spills over to potentially more applications in\nconcentrated regions. Hence it may be expected that the economic impact of new firms increases\nwith the degree of urbanization. Support for the existence of agglomeration advantages is provided\nby several studies that argue that knowledge spillovers are more pronounced in concentrated regions\n(Agrawal, 2002; Autant-Bernard, 2001; Cani\u00ebls, 2000; Audretsch, 1998).\nThe importance of agglomeration effects is also investigated by Brakman et al. (2005). They\nestimate econometric models derived from the New Economic Geography (Fujita, Krugman and\nVenables, 1999, Fujita and Thisse, 2002), using a data base for European regions. The New\nEconomic Geography is a relatively new branch of economics that incorporates agglomeration\nadvantages and location choice in a formal general equilibrium framework. Firms choose to locate\nin core regions or in peripheral regions. At the aggregate level, based on a trade-off between\nagglomeration advantages (e.g. lower trade costs because of a larger local market) and\nagglomeration disadvantages (e.g. congestion; high land prices) a \u2018dispersion equilibrium\u2019\n(supporting an even distribution of economic activity across regions), or an \u2018agglomeration\nequilibrium\u2019 (supporting a disproportionate amount of economic activity in core regions) may\nemerge. For their European data base Brakman et al. (2005) find empirical support for an\n7\u2018agglomeration equilibrium\u2019 to exist. This implies that regional disparities are persistent. We will\nperform some exercises to investigate whether agglomeration effects exist within the Netherlands as\nwell.\n2.2 Empirical evidence for the Netherlands\nSeveral empirical studies of the relation between start-up activity and economic performance have\nadopted different approaches yielding different results. For a discussion of these (international)\nresults we refer to van Stel and Storey (2004) and Fritsch (2007). In this paper we will limit\nourselves to the empirical studies performed for the Netherlands.\nEmpirical investigations to the relation between the number of (new) businesses and economic\nperformance at the regional level for the Netherlands are scarce. This is related to the limited use\nand availability of regional start-up data. As far as we know, original research using systematic\ninformation on the number of start-ups and the number of businesses in the Netherlands covering all\neconomic activity is only performed at EIM Business and Policy Research.2 Hence the only Dutch\nstudies on the topic are also EIM-based. Nevertheless the empirical evidence is mixed.\nIn EIM (1994, pp. 41-47), a principal component type of analysis is conducted, using data for Dutch\nCOROP regions in the period 1987-1990.3 No relation is found between employment growth and\nthe principal component \u2018firm dynamics\u2019 (determined by the numbers of entries and exits). Bosma\nand Nieuwenhuijsen (2002) investigate the impact of turbulence (sum of entries and exits) on\ngrowth of total factor productivity for Dutch COROP regions in the period 1988-1996. They find a\npositive effect for services and no effect for manufacturing. Van Stel and Nieuwenhuijsen (2004),\nusing the same regional data base, find an opposite result: a positive effect of the number of\n8businesses on regional growth for manufacturing, and no effect for services. A number of\ndifferences between the studies may be responsible for these different findings. First, EIM (1994)\nand Bosma and Nieuwenhuijsen (2002) use a measure of firm dynamics (entry and exit) while van\nStel and Nieuwenhuijsen (2004) use the total number of businesses as a measure of competition.\nSecond, while the former two studies scale their measures on the number of existing businesses, the\nlatter uses regional employment as a scaling variable. The choice of scaling variable is not trivial.\nGiven that the units of account are geographical areas that vary in size, the number of start-ups\nneeds to be normalised by a size measure. The denominator should both control for the different\nabsolute sizes of the regions concerned, and represent the source from which start-ups or firm\nformations are most likely to come (Ashcroft, Love and Malloy, 1991). The two most commonly\nused denominators are the stock of existing firms, and the size of the regional workforce (or the\nlevel of regional employment). These approaches are called the ecological approach and the labour\nmarket approach, respectively (Audretsch and Fritsch, 1994). The ecological approach assumes new\nfirms arise from existing ones, whereas the labour market approach assumes that new firms arise\nfrom (potential) workers. The choice of measure can be highly significant. For example, for a given\nnumber of start-ups, regions which are equally large in terms of workforce but which are different in\nterms of average firm size, will have the same start-up rate according to the labour market approach\nbut different start-up rates according to the ecological approach. Garofoli (1994) makes a robust\ncase in favour of \u2018labour market\u2019 over \u2018ecological\u2019. The latter, he argues, is misleading in areas with\nsmall numbers of (generally large) firms. Here small numbers of new firms would provide an\nartificially high birth rate, primarily because of the small values of the denominator. Audretsch and\nFritsch (1994) demonstrate that, in West Germany, the statistical relationship between\nunemployment and start-up activity crucially depends on the ecological or labour market methods\n9used to measure start-up rates. We favour the Garofoli arguments and, in line with van Stel and\nNieuwenhuijsen (2004), in this paper we will use the labour market approach (see also Section 3).\nA third reason for the different findings between the three studies may be the different control\nvariables employed. In particular, van Stel and Nieuwenhuijsen (2004) control for spatial\nautocorrelation, while EIM (1994) and Bosma and Nieuwenhuijsen (2002) do not. Spatial\nautocorrelation refers to the phenomenon that regions are economically interdependent, which may\ncause the disturbance terms of neighbouring regions in a regression model to be correlated. The\nproblem of spatial autocorrelation may emerge in particular when the regions are defined to be\nsmall, and when the dependent variable relates to economic performance (as is the case for the\nstudies under consideration). Hence it is essential to correct for spatial autocorrelation in this type of\nstudies.\nAlthough it is difficult to establish exactly how the differences mentioned above are related to the\ndifferent empirical results, it is likely that the differences in approach are part of the explanation for\nthe different results found in these studies. In any case, the need for further research is clear. In\nparticular, while the most recent data used in the studies mentioned above are for 1996, the present\nstudy will use data up to and including 2002.\n3. Data\nIn this paper we use a regional data base for the period 1988-2002. The regional aggregation level\nemployed is the Dutch COROP level (spatial NUTS-III level), which consists of 40 regions. The\ndata are also subdivided by sector. The sectoral classification contains five main sectors of the\nDutch economy, viz. manufacturing (International Standard Industrial Classification code D),\nconstruction (ISIC code F), trade (ISIC codes GH), transport & communication (ISIC code I), and\n10\nservices (ISIC codes JKNOP). The definitions and sources of the main variables used in this study\nare given below. With the exception of population density the variables are available at the regional\nand sectoral level as described above.\n- Employment growth. Data on employment are taken from Statistics Netherlands and the\nemployment figures relate to employee jobs expressed in full-time equivalents or labour years. Part-\ntime work is proportionally being counted as fulltime work. Self-employed workers and unpaid\nfamily workers are excluded from the data. The employment levels have been measured at the first\nof January each year. The employment growth rates are measured over periods of three years, and\nare expressed in percent points.\n- Start-up rate. Following the labour market approach we define the start-up rate as the number of\nnew-firm start-ups divided by employment in full-time equivalents (as described above). The data\non the number of start-ups are taken from the Dutch Chambers of Commerce. The number of start-\nups is defined to include all independent new-firm registrations. It includes both new firms with\nemployees and new firms without employees. Mergers, new subsidiary companies, new branches\nand relocations to other regions are not counted as a start-up.\n- Wage growth measures three-yearly changes in regional wage rates and is expressed in percent\npoints. The wage rate is computed as total wages in a sector\/region divided by the employment of\nemployees in full-time equivalents. Data on wages are also taken from Statistics Netherlands (CBS).\nBecause sectoral classifications used by CBS changed in 1993, corrections had to be made in order\nto arrive at wage rates according to a uniform sectoral classification.\n- Data on population density were also taken from Statistics Netherlands.\n11\nSome descriptive statistics for the dependent variable in this study (three-year employment growth)\nand the main independent variable (the start-up rate) are presented below. The statistics are\npresented by time period (Table I), by sector of economic activity (Table II) and by major region\n(Table III). Table I shows that in the period 1996-99 employment growth was three times as high\ncompared to the other periods, corresponding to the boom of the Dutch economy in this period.\nAverage start-up rates are quite stable over time though.4 From Table II we see that in the period\n1990-2002 employment grew fastest in the services industries. We also see that manufacturing has\nthe lowest start-up rate. This is caused by the higher entry barriers in this sector, for instance the\nlevel of start-up capital required to start a firm in this sector is much higher compared to the average\nnew firm in the service or trade sectors.5 Table III, finally, shows that there are also differences by\nregions at the NUTS-I level, particularly in employment growth levels. Differences in the number of\nstart-ups are not so high. Note however that these statistics are averaged both over time and over\nsectors, hence differences that exist at the sector level are not visible in Table III.\nTABLE I, II AND III ABOUT HERE\n4. Model and research design\nAs mentioned earlier, in investigating the impact of new firms on regional employment, we focus on\nthe lag structure of the impact, and on differences between sectors and degree of urbanization,\nrespectively. These different angles of looking at the relationship call for different model\nspecifications and research designs to be used. In particular, in terms of panel data analysis, the\nmodel focusing on the lag structure calls for a within-type of analysis (investigating the impact of\n12\nchanges in the start-up rate over time) while the other types of analyses call for a between-type of\nanalysis (investigating differences in the start-up rate between regions). The research design that we\nwill use in each case will be described below.\n4.1 Research design for analysis of the lag structure of the economic impact of new firms\nSector adjustment in data\nIn this analysis we focus on the start-up rate for the whole regional economy. Therefore for each\nregion the sectoral data have to be aggregated to the regional economy level. In doing so we use the\nsector adjusted start-up rate. The start-up rates are sectorally adjusted to correct for different sector\nstructures across regions. Differences in sector structures lead to different start-up rates at the\naggregate level, because start-up rates are far from identical across sectors (see Table II). The\nregional sector start-up rates are weighted by employment by sector for the Netherlands as a whole\n(see Ashcroft, Love and Malloy, 1991). Hence we impose an identical sector structure on each\nregion. In this way we eliminate the impact of sector structure from our analysis. Similarly, we also\napply a sector adjustment (using the same weighting scheme) for the variables employment growth\nand wage growth.\nAlmon lags\nAs we are interested in the short-, medium- and long-run impact of new firms on regional\nemployment growth, we would, in principle, want to estimate a regression where employment\nchange is explained by the sector adjusted start-up rate and several lags of the start-up rate.\nHowever, in reality regional start-up rates are heavily correlated over time (see Table IV) causing\nsevere problems of multicollinearity. To avoid these problems we use the Almon lag method.\n13\nBasically this method imposes restrictions on the parameters of the start-up rates in such a way that\nthe estimated coefficients of the start-up rates are a function of the lag length. By substituting these\nrestrictions back in the original equation one arrives at a more compact model which can be\nestimated without problems of multicollinearity. We refer to Stewart (1991, pp. 180-182) for a\ngeneral description of the Almon method and to van Stel and Storey (2004, pp. 905-907, Appendix\n3) for a similar application of this method using start-up rates and employment growth rates of\nBritish regions.\nTABLE IV ABOUT HERE\nControl variables\nWhen estimating our Almon lag model where the impact of the start-up rate on the three-year\nemployment growth rate is estimated as a function of the lag of the start-up rate, we include some\ncontrol variables which are also expected to influence regional employment change. First, we\ncorrect for spatial autocorrelation, i.e. the phenomenon that regions are economically\ninterdependent, causing the growth rates and disturbance terms of neighbouring regions to be\ncorrelated. To correct for this, following Fritsch and Mueller (2004), we compute for each region the\naverage of the residuals in the neighbouring regions and include this variable as an explanatory\nvariable in the model. Second, following van Stel and Storey (2004) we also include wage growth as\nan explanatory variable. In labour economics local wage growth is a common determinant of\nemployment growth. Rees and Shah (1986) assume a welfare maximising individual chooses\nbetween utility in self-employment compared with paid employment, for which wages are taken as\nthe proxy. Hence rises in wage rates would be expected to lead to movements into wage-\n14\nemployment and out of self-employment, consistent with a positive effect on employment change\n(which in the present study is defined to include employees only). Furthermore, higher wages may\nindicate rising demand implying regional growth. However, there is also a negative effect as a\nhigher price of labour may lead to a lower demand for labour (substitution between capital and\nlabour). These opposite effects make the sign of wage rates indeterminate from theory.\nEstimation method\nAs the focus of this analysis is on the effects of new firms over time, we will make use of fixed\neffects estimation. For each region only the deviations from the average over time of the model\nvariables are considered. Basically the unobservable-time invariant structural differences between\nregions are eliminated in this way. Furthermore, to safeguard a straightforward interpretation of the\nregression results, we remove outlier observations.6\n4.2 Research design for analyses of sectors and degree of urbanization\nFor our analyses by sector and by degree of urbanization we do not need to make use of aggregate\nstart-up rates at the whole regional economy level. We directly use the data at the regional and\nsectoral level. Furthermore, because the focus here is on the differences between regions we will not\ninclude start-up rates from every period. Instead we use the average start-up rate for the three years\nimmediately preceding the period over which the dependent variable employment growth is\ncalculated.\nControl variables\nBesides the controls for spatial autocorrelation and wage growth described in Section 4.1, we\ninclude two further control variables here. The first control factor is population density. This\n15\nvariable may capture several effects. According to Audretsch and Fritsch (2002, p. 120), who also\nuse population density as a control in their regressions for Germany, \u201cPopulation density here\nrepresents all kinds of regional influences such as availability of qualified labour, house prices, local\ndemand and the level of knowledge spillovers\u201d. The second additional control factor is lagged\nemployment growth. Those regions with high economic growth may be attractive areas for new\nfirms to locate as local demand is high. This reversed causality effect potentially causes the impact\nof start-up rates on employment growth to be overestimated. This is due to positive path dependency\nin the economic performance of regions (i.e. the business cycle effect). We correct for this by\nincluding a lagged dependent variable.7 Note that both these control variables relate to the\ndifferences between regions hence we do not include them in the fixed effects analysis described in\nSection 4.1. Furthermore, for the analysis of the degree of urbanization, we correct for sectoral\ndifferences by including sectoral dummies. As we are primarily interested in cross-regional\ndifferences here, we do not make use of fixed effects estimations. Instead we simply use OLS. Again\noutlier observations are removed.\nDegree of urbanization\nAs mentioned we also investigate whether the relation between new firms and regional growth is\ndependent on the degree of urbanization. For this purpose we create interaction terms of the start-up\nrate multiplied by a variable measuring a region\u2019s degree of urbanization or degree of rurality. These\nlatter variables are taken from Statistics Netherlands (CBS). In particular, for each COROP region\nCBS provides figures on the percentages of land that can be classified as \u2018very urbanized\u2019,\n\u2018urbanized\u2019, \u2018moderately urbanized\u2019, \u2018slightly urbanized\u2019 and \u2018not urbanized\u2019. The classes \u2018very\nurbanized\u2019 and \u2018urbanized\u2019 together form an indicator for the degree of urbanization. It measures the\npercentage of land in a region with 1500 or more addresses (of households and firms) per kilometre\nsquare. Likewise, the classes \u2018slightly urbanized\u2019 and \u2018not urbanized\u2019 together form an indicator for\n16\nthe degree of rurality, in which all areas are included with 1000 or less addresses per kilometre\nsquare. These variables are measured in the year 2000.\n5. Results\n5.1 Time structure of the impact of new firms on regional employment growth\nWe compute the short-, medium- and long-run impact of new firm formation on employment\ngrowth using the Almon method as described in Section 4.1. We choose to include the start-up rate\nfrom the current year as well as lagged start-up rates, up until eight years.8 Furthermore, we compute\nAlmon polynomials of second, third and fourth degree. Considering that our data base contains data\nfor the period 1988-2002 and our choice to include eight lags, implies that we can use six years in\nour estimation sample, hence the sample before removal of outliers consists of 240 observations (as\nthere are 40 regions). Estimation results are in Table V.\nFrom the left part of the table (unrestricted regression) we see that only the first and the last lag of\nthe start-up rate are significant, illustrating the multicollinearity problems described earlier.9 In the\nsecond part of the table the results of the Almon lag estimations are presented. Likelihood ratio tests\nreveal that a polynomial of third order is statistically optimal. From Table V we see that the\nloglikelihood values for the restricted regressions using second, third and fourth order Almon\npolynomials are -560.7, -556.2 and -555.8, respectively. Hence, a likelihood ratio test comparing\nsecond to third order polynomial rejects second order in favour of third order (test statistic 9.0 for a\n1% critical value of 6.64). Similarly, a likelihood ratio test comparing third to fourth order does not\nreject third order in favour of fourth order (test statistic 0.8 which is not even significant at 10%\nlevel). The finding that the third order polynomial is statistically superior is consistent with findings\nof other studies (Baptista, Esc\u00e1ria and Madruga, 2007; Fritsch and Mueller, 2004; 2007).\n17\nFor the regression with n=3 we see that the linear, quadratic and third degree terms are all\nsignificant. Furthermore both the control variables wage growth and spatial autocorrelation are\nsignificant (the positive sign pointing at positive interdependency of neighbouring regions) and the\nR2 value is quite high (0.691), indicating a good model fit.\nTABLE V ABOUT HERE\nThe restricted start-up coefficients resulting from the third order Almon estimation are in the most\nright column of Table V. This lag structure is presented graphically in Figure I.10 The graph\nconfirms the pattern described by Fritsch and Mueller (2004). First, there is a period of immediate\njob creation by the new firms (area I). Next, there is a period of crowding-out of competitors (area\nII).11 Finally, there are positive indirect supply-side effects. After some years the intensified\ncompetition induced by the new entrants results in a restructuring of the market which is\naccompanied by positive effects at the aggregate level. Examples of these types of effects are: more\nefficient production by incumbents because of the (threat of) increased competition; acceleration of\nstructural change\/innovation and an increased variety of products in the market.\nIn analyzing graphics like Figure I two aspects are of major (policy) importance. First, how long\ndoes it take before the maximum economic impact of new firm formation is reached? Second, how\nbig is the net employment-effect (in terms of Figure I, how big are the areas I, II and III?). The\nanswers to both these questions can be assumed to depend on the quality of the new firms. If the\nquality of the newcomers is high the net-effect is likely to be positive as the incumbent firms are\nconsiderably stimulated to perform better (the threat of the new firms is more severe). They may for\n18\ninstance increase efficiency freeing up resources for growth in other (new) parts of the market\n(niches). If the new firms are not so competitive the indirect supply-side effects are likely to be\nsmaller and the net-effect may well be negative. From Figure I we see that for our sample of Dutch\nregions the estimated impact is maximal after 5.5 years. Furthermore, comparing the size of areas I\nand III on the one hand, and the size of area II on the other, we conclude that for the Netherlands in\nthe period 1988-2002 the net-effect is positive.12 Comparing these results with similar studies for\nPortugal (see Baptista, Esc\u00e1ria and Madruga, 2007) and Great Britain (and in particular Scotland\nand Wales, see Mueller, van Stel and Storey, 2007), it seems that the Netherlands performs better,\nboth in terms of the time required to reach the maximum economic impact, and in terms of the size\nof the net-effect. This suggests that the average quality of a new-firm start-up in the Netherlands\nmay be relatively high.\nFIGURE I ABOUT HERE\nInterpreting the \u2018immediate effect\u2019\nIn Figure I the area corresponding to the immediate effect (area I) is positive, suggesting that \u2013 on\naverage \u2013 new firms immediately render positive job creation effects. However, considering the\nDutch economy this result is not as straightforward as it may seem at first sight. In particular,\nrelatively many new firms do not hire employees at the start. According to Bangma, Gibcus and van\nEck van der Sluijs (2005), on average over the period 1987-2003 each independent new-firm start-\nup in the Netherlands created 1.5 jobs at the start of the firm, including that of the\nentrepreneur\/business owner. Considering that in our study the employment measure excludes the\nself-employed, one might expect a negative effect. When a new firm is started by someone who was\npreviously wage-employed13, the number of employees goes down by one, while only half a (wage)\n19\njob is created (excluding the job of the entrepreneur). So, given our employment measure one would\nexpect the immediate effect to be negative.\nFIGURE II ABOUT HERE\nOne possible explanation for the positive immediate effect in Figure I (area I) may be the reversed\ncausality issue discussed earlier. New firms may want to locate in regions with strong economic\nperformance as local demand is likely to be high in such regions. Also, it may be more attractive to\nstart a new firm in a period of high growth rates compared to a recession period.14 Hence the\nreversed effect is expected to be positive. As the start-up rates of the current year and of the first two\nlags on the one hand, and the dependent variable employment growth on the other hand, are\nmeasured in the same period (see the the top and middle line in Figure II), the possibility that the\nimmediate effect is overestimated, cannot be ruled out.\nThis can be explained as follows. As explained earlier, both the (theoretical) immediate employment\neffect and the reversed effect are expected to be positive. However, because the period in which the\nimmediate employment effect is expected to emerge, overlaps with the period in which a reversed\ncausality effect might take place (this is the period during which the dependent and independent\nvariables overlap, compare the top and middle line in Figure II), the direction of causality is hard to\ndisentangle from the regression output. In other words, it is possible that the immediate effect\ncomputed on the basis of the regression coefficients, is actually overestimated. If in reality a positive\nreversed effect exists, then, to some extent, this effect will be picked up by the OLS coefficients, and\nhence the estimated impact of the start-up rates of the most recent years will be higher than the real\n(unknown) immediate employment effect.\n20\nTo test this, we estimated an Almon lag polynomial where the first two lags were excluded, so that\nonly the most recent start-up rate used overlaps with the period of employment growth (compare the\ntop and bottom line in Figure II). In this way the chance that a reversed effect is picked up by the\nregression coefficients is reduced considerably.15 Results are displayed in Table VI and Figure III.\nRemarkably, we no longer find an immediate positive effect of new firms on regional employment.\nParameter estimate 0\uf067 is negative. Even though this estimation is artificial (the impact in the current\nyear and one year lagged start-up rate is equal to zero by construction), it does illustrate that in\nFigure I the immediate effect might be overestimated due to reversed causality. When the first two\nyears are removed the positive area is replaced by a negative area. Also note that in both Figures 1\nand 3 the later positive effect ends after about seven years. It is likely that the early negative effect in\nFigure III corresponds to area II in Figure I and the later positive area to area III in Figure I. From\nthis exercise we conclude that the direct immediate job-creating impact of new firms is\noverestimated in Figure I.\nTABLE VI ABOUT HERE\nFIGURE III ABOUT HERE\n5.2 Does the impact of new firms on regional development differ by sector?\nIn this section we investigate whether the relation between regional start-up rates and employment\ngrowth differs across sectors of economic activity.16 Considering the focus on cross-regional\ndifferences, and to avoid a downward bias in the standard error, we use non-overlapping three-year\nperiods in each sample (as employment change is measured over three years), resulting in four time\n21\nobservations (1994, \u201996, \u201999 and 2002). As there are 40 regions this results for each sector in a\nsample of 160 observations, before removal of outliers.17\nResults of the sector-specific analyses are presented in Table VII. The result that stands out is that\nthe impact of new firm formation is by far the largest for manufacturing. Even though both average\nemployment growth and the average start-up rate are the lowest of all sectors (see Table II), those\nregions which have relatively high start-up rates in manufacturing benefit in terms of employment.\nThis may be related to the greater importance of innovation in manufacturing compared to, for\ninstance, services. Innovation in service firms has a different character than in manufacturing. In\nparticular, innovations in service industries are often non-technological and they mostly involve\nsmall and incremental changes in processes and procedures (de Jong et al., 2003, p. 16). To the\ncontrary, innovations in manufacturing tend to require more R&D and are often more radical in\nnature. In modern entrepreneurial economies radical innovation is more conducive to economic\ngrowth than incremental innovation. This is because industry life-cycles are shorter and hence, at a\ngiven point in time, more (niche) markets are in an early stage of the life cycle where R&D is highly\nproductive and the costs of radical innovation tend to be relatively low (Audretsch and Thurik,\n2001). Hence, a lack of entrepreneurship in manufacturing industries may be particularly damaging\nto economic performance, as it may imply a lack of incentives to create (radical) innovations.\nGiven the above background it may be the case that a highly skilled entrepreneurial individual\nchooses to set up a business in manufacturing instead of a business in the services sector. Starting a\nbusiness in manufacturing may be more challenging to such an individual because higher technical\nskills are required in this sector. If the higher skilled entrepreneurs choose to start businesses in\nmanufacturing instead of in other sectors, this may cause the average quality of a start-up in\nmanufacturing to be higher, which, in turn, causes the employment impact of a new firm to be\n22\nhigher. In other words, a selection effect may be at play. However, a different explanation for the\nlarge effect in manufacturing is related to the bigger average firm size compared to other sectors\n(minimum efficient scale is higher). It is likely that on average start-up size in manufacturing is also\nbigger compared to other sectors, implying that the direct employment effect may be relatively\npronounced. In other words, market structure effects also contribute to the differences found in\nTable VII. We note that by the current empirical exercise we are only able to establish the common\neffect, in other words we are not able to distinguish empirically between the selection effect and the\nmarket structure effect.\nTABLE VII ABOUT HERE\n5.3 Does the impact of new firms on regional development differ by degree of urbanization?\nIn this section we investigate whether the relation between regional start-up rates and employment\ngrowth differs across different parts of the country, and in particular, whether the degree of\nurbanization plays a role. It is imaginable that the effect of start-ups in urbanized regions is stronger,\nfor instance because of the agglomeration effects discussed in Section 2.1. In addition, human\ncapital levels in peripheral areas may on average be lower compared to urbanized regions, for\ninstance because the highly educated move away to the bigger cities where employment\nopportunities are better. This, in turn, may cause the average start-up in a peripheral area to be of a\nlower quality compared to the average start-up in an urbanized region (selection effect). Mueller,\nvan Stel and Storey (2007) provide empirical evidence showing that the employment impact of new\nfirms is smaller in Scotland and Wales compared to regions in England. These authors suggest that\nhuman capital levels of business founders in the peripheral areas Scotland and Wales are on average\n23\nlower than human capital levels of business founders in England.\nWe investigate whether the impact of start-ups differs with the degree of urbanization or rurality of a\nCOROP region. For this purpose we created interaction terms of the start-up rate multiplied by the\ndegree of urbanization or the degree of rurality as defined in Section 4.2.18 We pool data for four\ntime periods, five sectors and 40 regions resulting in 800 observations before cleaning of outliers.\nResults are in Table VIII. We estimate two slightly different models. First, we examine whether the\nimpact of new firms increases with the degree of urbanization (Model I). Table VIII suggests that\nthis might be the case as the interaction term is positive. The effect is not significant though. Second,\nwe examine whether the impact decreases with the degree of rurality (Model II). Table VIII suggests\nthat this is indeed the case. The interaction effect in Model II is significantly negative. The same\nnumber of new firms create less jobs in a rural area compared to a non-rural area.\nThe result from Table VIII might be explained by agglomeration effects such as a higher degree of\nknowledge spillovers in more dense regions. This explanation might interact with the observation\nthat new firms in rural areas are often of a different nature compared to new firms in urbanized\nregions (selection effect). Using the same CBS data base on the degree of urbanization, Hessels,\nBosma and Wennekers (2005) found that for the Netherlands the Total Entrepreneurial Activity rate\n(TEA) as measured by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, is highest for regions scoring high in\nthe extreme classes \u2018very urbanized\u2019 and \u2018not urbanized\u2019 (i.e. rural), compared to the middle three\nlevels of urbanization. In highly urbanized regions high start-up rates occur due to a high population\ndensity. The attitude towards entrepreneurship is positive and business start-ups are services related.\nIn rural regions the high start-up rates are related to a smaller average firm size and the fact that\nthere is a minimal level of shops and stores needed to sustain small village communities. Hence\nentrepreneurship in rural areas may be more of a subsistence nature. Similar to Section 5.2 we note\n24\nthat by the current empirical exercise we are only able to establish the common effect, in other\nwords we are not able to distinguish empirically between the selection effect and the agglomeration\neffect.\nTABLE VIII ABOUT HERE\nWe find the different impact of new-firm start-ups for urban and rural regions in Table VIII quite\nintriguing. Therefore we also want to investigate a different aspect: are the time patterns of the\nimpact different? We use the Almon lag methodology introduced earlier in the paper. In particular\nwe split the 233 observations sample used in Table V in urban and rural regions. For urban regions\nwe use the highly urbanized \u201cRandstad\u201d area in the West of the Netherlands. These are the COROP\nregions in the provinces Utrecht, North-Holland and South-Holland. The remaining COROP regions\nare categorized as \u2018rural\u2019. To illustrate the difference between the two samples, the average degree\nof urbanization (rurality), as defined in Section 4.2, is 56% (26%) for the Randstad sample, and 20%\n(62%) for the \u2018rural\u2019 sample. Note that the remaining percentage (18%, for both samples) refers to\nthe category \u2018moderately urbanized\u2019 (see Section 4.2).\nEstimation results for the third order polynomial are presented in Table IX, while the corresponding\ntime patterns of the impact of new firms are depicted in Figure IV. We see that the impact of new-\nfirm formation is larger in the urban regions compared to the rural regions, consistent with our\nearlier findings in Table VIII. What is striking though is that the impact for the urban sample does\nnot become negative, and that for the rural regions there is no positive direct effect. As suggested\nearlier, both agglomeration effects and selection effects may explain these differences. However,\nmore research is needed to fully understand the different patterns shown in Figure IV.\n25\nTABLE IX ABOUT HERE\nFIGURE IV ABOUT HERE\nAlthough more research is needed in this area we may conclude from the above exercises that the\nlocation of a new firm is important. This is in line with findings of Hoogstra and van Dijk (2004).\nThey address the question to what extent the location of a firm can be regarded as having an\ninfluence on employment growth of a firm. Using an econometric model based on a data set of circa\n35,000 establishments in the northern provinces of the Netherlands, they find that \u2018location matters\u2019.\nIn particular the authors find that both belonging to a spatial cluster of similar firms and a great\ndiversity of economic activities in the area a firm is located enhances employment growth of that\nfirm. Our results are also in line with the study of Brakman et al. (2005), described in Section 2.1,\nwho find empirical support for an \u2018agglomeration equilibrium\u2019 to exist.\n6. Discussion\nIn this paper the relationship between new firm formation and regional employment change has been\nexamined. Using a new regional data base for the period 1988-2002, we examine the time lags\ninvolved in the relationship. We also investigate whether the relationship differs by sector and by\ndegree of urbanization. We find that the maximum effect of new businesses on regional\ndevelopment is reached after about six years. Our results also suggest that the overall employment\nimpact of new-firm start-ups is positive but that the immediate employment effects may be small in\nthe Netherlands. Furthermore, we find that the employment impact of new firms is strongest for\nmanufacturing and that the employment impact of new firms is stronger in areas with a higher\ndegree of urbanization.\n26\nOur research has several policy implications related to the short and long-run effects of new firm\nformation. First, concerning short-term effects, policy makers are often inclined to stimulate\nbusiness creation on the ground that new firms immediately create jobs. Our exercises suggest\nhowever that the immediate employment effect may actually be small in the Netherlands. Second,\nconcerning long-run effects, policy makers are often inclined to neglect these, or at least to put less\nemphasis on these effects. However, as the longer term effects may well be substantial, it is of vital\nimportance to take these into account when considering regional growth policies (Mart\u00ed, 2004;\nHoogstra and van Dijk, 2004). The Almon lag model used in the present study is able to take the\nshort as well as the long-run effects into account. We find that the maximum impact is reached after\nabout six years and that the net-employment effect of start-ups is positive. Comparing these results\nwith those obtained for other countries (in particular Portugal, Scotland and Wales), we see that the\nmaximum economic impact is reached faster, and that the net employment-effect is larger. This\ntentatively suggests that the average quality of a new-firm start-up in the Netherlands may be\nrelatively high.\nHowever, this should not be taken as an encouragement to implement policies designed to maximize\nthe number of new-firm start-ups, particularly in peripheral regions. The net-employment effect is\ndependent on the quality of the new firms. Once business creation in peripheral areas is subsidized\nthis may attract entrepreneurs with lower levels of human capital who contribute negatively to\nregional development. Research for Great Britain by Mueller, van Stel and Storey (2007) provides\nsome intuition for this hypothesis. Using a similar Almon lag approach they show that the net\nemployment-effect of new firms is smaller for regions in Scotland and Wales compared to English\nregions. In a British context Scotland and Wales may be considered peripheral lagging regions with\nrelatively many (often subsidized) start-ups in easy to enter, non-innovative sectors. From a policy\n27\nperspective the British results suggest that subsidising entry may not be productive if the subsidised\nentrants are in easy to enter, non-innovative sectors such as vehicle-repairing and window cleaning\n(van Stel and Storey, 2004).\nThe conclusion that stimulating business creation in peripheral areas may be inefficient is also in\nline with the study by Brakman et al. (2005), described in Section 2.1. By estimating econometric\nmodels derived from the New Economic Geography, they find empirical support for an\n\u2018agglomeration equilibrium\u2019 to exist, suggesting that for their European data set the agglomeration\nadvantages (such as higher levels of knowledge spillovers) outweigh the disadvantages (such as\ntraffic congestion). This would imply that regional disparities are persistent and hence difficult to\ncounter with regional policy. The authors therefore conclude that attracting economic activity to the\nperiphery through subsidies does not make sense, as this economic activity will in the long run be\npulled to the core because of agglomeration advantages. The periphery lacks the critical economic\nmass to hold on to mobile firms. While the results of Brakman et al. (2005) are valid in a general\nEuropean context, results in the present study suggest that structural differences between regions\nmatter within the Netherlands as well. We find the employment effect of start-ups in rural areas to\nbe smaller compared to the effect in urban areas. It is conceivable that many of the more mobile\nstart-ups in the periphery who find that they are less effective because of their location will relocate\nin the core.19 Therefore it is far from obvious that potential regional policies designed to maximize\nthe number of start-ups in peripheral areas will have the desired effects on the regional economy.\nAlthough the prior comments are caveats against generic quantity-based business stimulation\npolicies, this is not to say that any stimulation policy would be futile. Instead, when considering\nbusiness stimulation policies, both the quantity and the quality of the new-firm start-ups should be\ntaken into account.\n28\nAcknowledgement: We are grateful to Michael Fritsch, Jolanda Hessels, Niels Bosma, Gerrit de\nWit, two anonymous referees, and participants at the workshop on \u201cThe Effects of New Businesses\non Economic Development in the Short, Medium and Long Run\u201d (Jena, July 11-12, 2005), for\nproviding us with helpful comments and suggestions.

Medium-sized firms have a work force of 10-99 and large firms have a work force of 100 and more\nfull-time equivalents.\n2 EIM Business and Policy Research is an independent research and consultancy organisation based in the\nNetherlands with about 80 regular employees. EIM has been carrying out policy research on enterprise issues for 75\nyears in various fields such as entrepreneurship and business development, employment, ICT, innovation,\ninternationalisation and administrative burdens. On behalf of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs EIM carries\nout a large research program on SMEs and entrepreneurship.\n3 The COROP classification is the regional classification for the Netherlands at the NUTS-III spatial aggregation\nlevel. The NUTS Boundaries data set (Nomenclature des Unites Territoriales Statistiques) shows sub-national\nadministrative areas within the European Community (EC). Every EC member state has different levels of\nadministrative subdivisions, designated as NUTS-I, NUTS-II and NUTS-III (these are the smallest regions). In the\nNetherlands the regions at NUTS-III level are also known as \u2018COROP\u2019 regions, named after the committee who\ndesigned the regional classification for the Netherlands in 1971.\n4 An explanation may be that for those self-employed individuals who practise a \u2018free profession\u2019 (e.g. consultants,\nnotaries, etc.) it is not compulsory to register their business at the Chamber of Commerce. As the economic upturn\nmay have benefited this group of self-employed in particular, the increase in \u2018free profession\u2019 self-employed may\nnot be fully reflected by the statistics. However, a more plausible explanation is that, besides the number of start-\nups, the denominator of the start-up rate (i.e. the level of employment) has risen as well, yielding the start-up rate to\nbe stable over time. Indeed, further investigation reveals that over the period 1991-2002 both the number of start-\nups and employment in fulltime equivalents (FTEs) have increased with some 21.7% (on average 1.8% per year).\nHowever, in the booming years 1999 and 2000 the rises in the absolute number of start-ups were 9.6% and 16.3%,\nrespectively (for the whole Dutch economy).\n5 Additionally, the shift of economic activity away from manufacturing and toward services which takes place in\nalmost all Western economies, causes the number of start-ups in manufacturing to be relatively low.\n6 Those observations which have an absolute normalized residual greater than 2.5 are removed (on average some\n3% of the original sample observations).\n7 The concept of using lagged dependent variables to correct for reversed causality is known in the econometric\nliterature as Granger-causality. See Granger (1969).\n8 We do not know a priori over what period of time the lagged startup rates still have an impact. We choose a rather\nlong period (eight years) in order to allow for the possibility that startup rates of eight years ago still have an impact\non current employment. The choice of eight years does not imply however that startups of eight years ago actually\nimpact current employment. It is through the Almon lag procedure that we can determine the period (i.e. the\nmaximum lag) for which the lagged startup rates have an impact.\n9 The joint impact of the current and lagged start-up rates is statistically significant though. The loglikelihood value\nfor a restricted model excluding all start-up rate variables equals -565.4, while the loglikelihood value for the\n\u2018unrestricted regression\u2019 in Table V equals -552.3. Hence the likelihood ratio test statistic comparing these two\nmodels equals 26.2 which is greater than 21.7, the critical \uf0632 value at 1% level with nine degrees of freedom.\n10 The picture for the fourth order polynomial (not in the paper) looks very similar.\n11 Area II also captures employment losses in the non-surviving new firms.\n12 An alternative method to estimate the net-effect is to add the separate coefficients of the startup rates. The sum of\nthe separate coefficients from Table V (either the sum of the unrestricted or the sum of the restricted coefficients) is\nnegative. However, from Figure I we see that phase III ends after seven years implying that startup rates which are\nlagged more than seven years have no impact on current employment. Hence the negative coefficient for the eighth\nlag should not be counted when computing the net-effect. The negative value of this coefficient is probably due to\nmisspecification of the unrestricted model, i.e. we allow for an impact of eight years while actually the impact dies\nout after seven years. Indeed when we estimate the model allowing for an impact of seven years only, the sum of the\nunrestricted coefficients is positive (0.485), consistent with Figure I.\n13 In the Netherlands, on average two out of every three start-ups are started by persons who were previously wage-\nemployed (van Uxem and Bais, 1996).\n14 Considering the \u2018within\u2019 estimation context of the current application (see Section 4), this latter explanation is\nactually more valid here. In other words, differences over time are more important than differences between regions.\n15 This possibility can never be ruled out completely because of path dependency in the employment growth\nvariable.\n16 As we use employment growth by sector in this analysis we are not able to account for the effects that the start-up\nmight have on the intersectoral division of labor.\n17 Note that the non-significance of the Jarque Bera (JB) statistics indicate the cleaned samples residuals are\n46\nnormally distributed.\n18 We also include the degree of urbanization (rurality) as a separate variable in the model, in order to safeguard\nstraightforward interpretation of the coefficient of the interaction term. As the correlation between the degree of\nurbanization and population density is very high (0.9), the latter variable is removed from this model specification.\n19 Here mobility refers to the willingness and ability, now or in the future, to move the firm if required by\n(economic) circumstances. Furthermore, as mentioned in Section 5.3, whether agglomeration effects or selection\neffects dominate, this is still an open question.\n"}
