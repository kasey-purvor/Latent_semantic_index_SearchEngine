INTRODUCTION\nTo date, the majority of intercomparisons between uni-\nform grid finite difference models and unstructured grid fi-\nnite element models have concentrated upon the barotropic\ntide. Such a detailed intercomparison was performed by a\nnumber of groups in connection with tides in the English\nChannel, giving rise to a range of papers as part of the\ntidal flow forum (e.g. Werner 1995; Lynch et al. 1995; Wal-\nters and Werner 1989; Walters 1987). In the case of the\nbarotropic tide, it has a long wavelength, and hence little\nshort\u2013scale spatial variability, except in nearshore regions.\nFor this reason an increase in finite element resolution,\nor map transformation (Johns et al. 1981) combined with\nboundary\u2013fitted coordinates in a finite difference model to\nimprove coastal resolution is a logical way to refine the grid.\nSince these early applications of finite element models to\nbarotropic tides, the range of oceanographic problems has\nincreased (see the review of Walters (2005)).\nIn recent years with increased interest in shelf edge pro-\ncesses (Huthnance 1995) and baroclinic motion, the topic of\ninternal tides has received increasing attention. In the shelf\nedge region where stratification intersects the shelf slope\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nEmail address: phh@pol.ac.uk (P. Hall).\nthe motion of the barotropic tide at a frequency x gives rise\nto an internal tide at the same frequency with non\u2013linear\neffects giving higher harmonics (Lamb, 2004) and a tidal\nresidual (Xing and Davies 2001a). Internal wave beams at\na frequency \u03c9 have a slope r given by\nr2 = (\u03c92 \u2212 f 2)\/(N 2 \u2212 \u03c92),\nwith N a constant buoyancy frequency and f the Coriolis\nfrequency. Depending upon the relative steepness of topog-\nraphy s=\u2207h,with h water depth, the topography is classed\nas supercritical (s>r), critical (s=r) or subcritical (s<r).\nOnce generated the internal tide propagates away from its\ngeneration region along beams. Both on\u2013shelf and off\u2013shelf\npropagation can occur depending upon the local topogra-\nphy and stratification, with the internal tide being reflected\nat both sea surface and sea bed. The wavelength of the\ninternal tide varies significantly depending upon local to-\npography variations and stratification, but is typically the\norder of kilometres rather than the hundreds of kilometres\nassociated with the barotropic tide. For this reason and to\nresolve the shelf slope, a significantly finer grid is required\nin the shelf edge region for an accurate representation of\nthe baroclinic tide than that used for the barotropic tide.\nEarly models of the internal tide were semi\u2013analytical,\nor used a cross\u2013sectional model (e.g. Craig 1987; Sherwin\nand Taylor 1990; New 1988; Xing and Davies 1997b) and\nPostprint of article published in Ocean Dynamics (2005) 55: 272-293 16 July 2007\nhence grid resolution was not critical, in that high resolu-\ntion could be included everywhere. However, as shown by\nXing and Davies (1997b) in a comparison of the numeri-\ncal solution with the analytical solution of Craig (1987),\nan across shelf resolution of 3 km with 50 sigma levels in\nthe vertical was required. The reason for this high resolu-\ntion was that internal tides have a short wavelength. Also\ntheir generation at the shelf edge is critically dependent\nupon shelf slope and vertical stratification. The limitations\nof using an across shelf \u201dslice\u201d model are well known (Xing\nand Davies 1998; Legg 2004a,b) in regions where there is\nan appreciable along shelf forcing such as the area con-\nsidered here. Consequently, it is essential in such regions\nto use a full three\u2013dimensional model that can accurately\nresolve both the across and along shelf variations in to-\npography and density field in the shelf edge region. Con-\nsequently, besides refining the grid in the nearshore area\nin order to reproduce the barotropic tide, it is essential to\ninclude an enhanced grid refinement in the shelf edge re-\ngion. Once generated at the shelf edge the internal tide can\npropagate both offshelf into the ocean, and onto the shelf.\nThe wavelength associated with this propagation is signif-\nicantly shorter than the barotropic wavelength. As shown\nby Hall and Davies (2005) (hereafter referred to as HD05)\nthe short wavelength of internal waves must be taken into\naccount in determining the rate of grid refinement from a\nfine grid in the region of internal wave generation to coarse\ngrid outside this region. Also, as shown by HD05 in the case\nof wind\u2013forced internal waves, if the grid refinement is too\nrapid, small\u2013scale waves are excited and numerical insta-\nbility can occur. However, by using a Smagorinsky (1963)\nform of horizontal viscosity, this can be overcome (HD05).\nThe scale\u2013selective filtering associated with the Smagorin-\nsky (1963) form of viscosity is now well known and has been\nsuccessfully used in Large Eddy Simulation (LES) calcula-\ntions. This problem is briefly considered here for the case\nof an internal tide.\nThe computational requirement in a three\u2013dimensional\ninternal tide model to have a fine grid in the shelf edge\nregion, yet allow for accurate propagation away from this\nregion, is an important consideration in designing an ir-\nregular grid. In this paper we examine the problem of in-\nternal tide generation off the west coast of Scotland using\ntwo unstructured grid resolutions and the QUODDY code.\nThe QUODDY code uses a finite element method in the\nhorizontal and a sigma coordinate approach in the verti-\ncal. The vertical eddy viscosity is parameterized using a\nMellor-Yamada turbulence model (see later Discussion). As\nthe code and the method used are well established [e.g. see\nLynch and Naimie (1993); Ip and Lynch (1995)], details\nwill not be repeated here.\nIn order to compare results with an existing three\u2013\ndimensional internal tide finite difference model (Xing and\nDavies 1998) (hereafter referred to as XD98), the region\noff the west coast of Scotland was examined. This area is\nideal for a model intercomparison study in that there is a\nstrong barotropic tidal forcing in the region, which pro-\nduces a significant internal tide. Also the shelf slope is not\nconstant, but the gradient changes appreciably along the\nshelf edge. This change in gradient and the existence of\ntwo off\u2013shelf seamounts which influence the internal tide\n(XD98) makes the region ideal for the use of an irregu-\nlar grid. In the calculations performed here, the bottom\ntopography and open boundary forcing were identical to\nthose used by XD98 in a uniform finite difference grid\nmodel. By using the same topography and forcing in all\ncalculations, the influence of grid resolution and solution\nmethod (namely, finite difference (XD98) or finite element\n(QUODDY)) upon the solution can be assessed. The main\nfocus of this paper is a model intercomparison study rather\nthan an examination of the processes influencing the gen-\neration and propagation of the internal tide, which are\ncovered in detail in XD98. The interested reader is referred\nto XD98 for details of stratification, energy flux and the\nrole of seamounts and shelf slope in terms of internal tide\nphysics. In the next section (Sect. 2) we briefly describe\nthe topography of the region (with reference to XD98 for\ndetail) and the two irregular horizontal grids used in the\ncalculation. The solution using the finite element sigma\ncoordinate model is described in Sects. 3 and 4. In the final\nsection, results from the inter\u2013comparison of the different\ngrid resolutions and the solution of XD98 are summarized.\n2. The hydrodynamic equations, topography of\nthe region, and choice of grid.\nThe fundamental hydrodynamic equations, which are\nsolved with the various modelling approaches described\nhere, are identical to those solved by XD98. As they are\ndiscussed in detail in Xing and Davies (2001b) they will\nnot be repeated here, except to give a general overview of\ntheir basic form.\nThe models are based upon the three\u2013dimensional free\nsurface, nonlinear primitive equations expressed in polar\ncoordinates. The hydrostatic approximation is used, and\ndensity is derived from temperature using a simple equa-\ntion of state (XD98). The models are prognostic in that\nthe temperature field evolves with time due to advection\nand diffusion terms. Consequently, the on\u2013\/off\u2013shelf prop-\nagation of the barotropic tide gives rise to internal pressure\ngradients at the shelf edge and hence an internal tide as de-\nscribed in XD98. Vertical mixing of momentum and density\nare parameterized using vertical eddy viscosity and diffu-\nsivity coefficients which are determined using a turbulence\nenergy closure sub\u2013model (e.g. Blumberg and Mellor 1987;\nLuyten et al. 1996, 2002; XD98). The coefficient of horizon-\ntal viscosity was parameterized using a Smagorinsky (1963)\nformulation with the arbitrary scaling coefficient taken as\nC=0.28 (HD05) in the majority of calculations. In a final\ncalculation to examine its influence this value was doubled.\nThe benefits of using this formulation for horizontal viscos-\nity in an internal wave problem involving an irregular grid\nhave been demonstrated in HD05.\n2\nSince the calculation, as in XD98, is concerned with the\nshort\u2013term dynamics of the internal tide, rather than its\nseasonal variation, there is no applied surface heat flux\nor wind stress. Similarly for the turbulence energy model,\nthere is no turbulence flux through the sea surface or sea\nbed. A quadratic friction law as in XD98 was applied at\nthe sea bed. Along the open boundary the barotropic tide\nwas identical to that used by XD98. A sigma coordinate\nwas used in the vertical with 40 levels having enhanced res-\nolution in the near bed and near surface region where the\ninternal tide is largest. This is consistent with the verti-\ncal resolution used in XD98. In all calculations the model\nstarted from a state of rest with zero elevation displace-\nment. In the baroclinic calculation the same temperature\nprofile and hence N2 profile taken as the strongly strati-\nfied case (XD98, see their Fig. 4) was applied everywhere.\nBy this means, in the initial conditions the isotherms were\nhorizontal. In response to open boundary barotropic tidal\nforcing, in the stratified case a baroclinic tide was generated\nat the shelf edge. After about six tidal cycles, the influence\nof the initial conditions was removed and a sinusoidal con-\ndition was reached which could be harmonically analysed.\nIn order to separate the internal tide from the barotropic\ntide, in the baroclinic calculations a barotropic tidal solu-\ntion was subtracted from the total. This is consistent with\nthe approach adopted in XD98.\nThe shelf and shelf edge region (Fig. 1) covered by the\nvarious models is identical to that used by XD98. The re-\ngion is characterized by a range of water depths from 2000\nm in the deep ocean to the order of 10 m in the near coastal\nregion. At the shelf edge taken as the 200 m contour (Fig.\n1), water depths increase rapidly from typically 100 m (on\nshelf) to 1000 m (oceanic). The movement of the density\nsurfaces over this steep topography, as the tide flows on\u2013\nand off\u2013shelf, generates the internal tide in this region.\nTo properly account for this generation process and sub-\nsequent internal tide propagation, it is essential to resolve\ntopography in this area. To examine the extent to which\nthe internal tide is influenced by grid resolution, calcula-\ntions were performed with both coarse (2894 nodes) (Fig.\n2) and fine (3981 nodes) (Fig. 3) unstructured grids. In the\nfine grid calculations the grid in the shelf edge region (Fig.\n3) was refined in the regions of steeper topography (Fig.\n1) in order to accurately resolve the shelf edge slope. This\nis particularly important, since this together with vertical\nstratification determines the generation of the internal tide\n(XD98). Also, as shown by XD98, internal tides are gener-\nated in the region of the Anton Dohrn Seamount and He-\nbrides Terrace Seamount (Fig. 1), and for this reason the\ngrid is refined in these regions (Fig. 3). Ideally, a more grad-\nual change in the mesh size, as the shelf edge is approached\nthan that shown in Fig. 3, would have been preferred. How-\never, this would have increased the computational effort,\nand as we will show, provided a Smagorinsky form of hori-\nzontal diffusion is used, there is no build\u2013up of small\u2013scale\nwaves in the shelf edge region. As themain focus is the baro-\nclinic tide which is dissipated before it reaches the coast, it\nis tempting to under\u2013resolve the near shore region. How-\never, as the baroclinic tide is forced by the barotropic tide\nwhich is significantly influenced by coastal effects, it is nec-\nessary to ensure adequate coastal resolution to enable an\naccurate distribution of the barotropic tidal forcing to be\nobtained.\n3. Tidal distributions computed with QUODDY.\nIn all calculations the model was started from a state\nof rest with a constant density in the barotropic case, and\nhorizontal temperature surfaces in the baroclinic calcula-\ntion. The vertical temperature profile and buoyancy fre-\nquency correspond to the strongly stratified case in XD98\n(see Fig. 4 in XD98 for details). Motion was induced by\ntidal forcing across the open boundary, and a periodic state\nwas obtained after 6 tidal cycles, which was harmonically\nanalyzed to give tidal amplitude and phase.\n3.1. Barotropic calculation\nIn an initial calculation using the coarser mesh (Calc 1,\nTable 1) the sea was taken as homogeneous and the three\u2013\ndimensional barotropic tide was computed. To enable a\n\u201dlike with like\u201d comparison to be performed with XD98,\nthis mesh was generated from the finite difference depth\nvalues used in XD98. The cotidal chart (not shown) was\nnot significantly different to that determined by XD98, and\nshowed a northward propagation of the barotropic tide,\nwith tidal amplitude increasing in the coastal region. The\nobserved amphidromic point in the North Channel was re-\nproduced in the model.\nA detailed comparison with observations at 41 positions\n(Table 2, since the location of these gauges is given in XD98\n(see Fig. 1a in XD98 for details) it will not be repeated\nhere), showed a similar good agreement with that found by\nXD98 at offshore locations. However, at coastal positions\nthe accuracy was slightly reduced due to the coarser nature\nof the unstructured grid in the coastal region than the fi-\nnite difference grid of XD98 (although the coastline itself is\nmore highly resolved). This is reflected in the slightly higher\nRMS amplitude error compared to XD98. Obviously, the\nunstructured grid used here could be refined in the coastal\nregion, but since the main emphasis is on internal tides this\nwas not done.\nThe computed M2 surface tidal current ellipse distribu-\ntion (Fig. 4a) exhibits the same large\u2013scale features found\nin XD98; in particular, the strong tidal currents in the\nNorth Channel and off the west coast of Scotland. The\nchange in alignment of the tidal current ellipses in the shelf\nedge region from essentially west-east at about 56\u25e6N to\nnorth-south at about 58\u25e6N (where the orientation of the\nshelf edge changes) found in XD98 is also reproduced here\n(Fig. 4a). The significant reduction in tidal currents be-\ntween ocean and shelf and the local intensification of cur-\n3\nFig. 1. Bottom topography used in the model. All depths are in metres. The lines marked C1, C2, C3 and D1n, D1c, D1s and D2 denote the\nlatitude of cross\u2013shelf sections used in comparing accuracy of the various grids. Also shown are geographical locations of regions named in\nthe text.\nrents over the Anton Dohrn Seamount are shown in Fig.\n4a, which was also found by XD98.\nA detailed comparison of u and v tidal current amplitudes\nand phases at a number of offshore observational points\n(Table 3, since the exact location of these current meters\nis given in XD98 (see Fig. 1b in XD98 for details) it will\nnot be repeated here) showed similar results to those found\nin XD98. The water depth h given in Table 3 refers to the\ntotal water depth, with sigma (\u03c3) determining the location\nof the measurement in the water column (namely \u03c3 = 0.0,\nsurface; \u03c3 = \u20131.0, sea bed). As the main emphasis of the\npaper is the application of the model to the internal tide, it\nis useful to examine shelf edge locations (namely T to E, see\nXD 98, Fig.1b for positions) in more detail in connection\nwith the stratified calculation (see later).\nIn a subsequent calculation (Calc 2, Table 1) the finer\nmesh (Fig. 3) was used to compute the barotropic tide. As\nstated previously to enable a \u201dlike with like\u201d comparison to\nbe performed with XD98, this mesh was generated from the\nfinite difference depth values used in XD98. The computed\ncotidal chart (not shown) was not significantly different to\nthat found using the coarser grid or by XD98. A detailed\ncomparison (not presented) at the locations given in Table\n2 where observations are available did not show an appre-\nciable difference between fine grid and coarse grid calcula-\ntions. This can be readily appreciated, since the finer grid\n(Fig. 3) is based upon the depths used by XD98, which are\nCalc Resolution Density\n(number nodes)\n1 2894 Homogeneous\n2 3981 Homogeneous\n3 2894 Stratified\n4 3981 Stratified\n5 3981 Stratified (C=0.56)\nTable 1\nSummary of various calculations.\nalso used in the coarse resolution grid (Fig. 2). The only\ndifference between the two is a refinement in the mesh in\nthe shelf edge region, and around the offshore seamounts.\nIn practice, if a more detailed bathymetry was available\nthan in XD98, this could be used to enhance the accuracy\nof the bottom topography as the mesh was refined.\nThe computedM2 surface tidal current distribution (Fig.\n4b) on the shelf shows a similar pattern to that found with\nthe coarse grid (Fig. 4a). However, in the shelf edge re-\ngion, the Anton Dohrn Seamount area and Hebrides Ter-\nrace seamount, it is clear that with the enhanced resolution\nin these regions, smaller scale variability than that shown\nin Fig. 4a can be seen. A detailed comparison of u and v\ntidal current amplitude and phase at the current observa-\ntion points (Table 3, Calc 2) showed similar differences to\nthose found with the coarse grid model (Calc 1). At shelf\nedge locations, H, I, J, K,W and M, N located at about\n57\u25e6N, both the u and v components of the barotropic veloc-\nity are appreciable (of order 15 cm s\u22121) and are reproduced\n4\nFig. 2. Coarse irregular Grid (G1) used in the calculations, with location of points used in time series comparisons. (For details of locations,\nsee text).\nto a similar level of accuracy on both grids. On average,\nthe tidal current amplitude computed with the finer mesh\nwas larger than the coarse mesh, reflecting its improved\nability to resolve the topography. Similarly, further north\nat locations P, Q, R, S and T, both solutions have similar\naccuracy and a close correspondence in the distribution of\nerrors with location was found. Since both grids are based\non the same distribution of water depths used by XD98 and\nare adequate for resolving the barotropic tide, then without\nadditional water depth information, there does not appear\nto be any improvement in accuracy of the finer grid solu-\ntion compared to the coarser, or the solution of XD98. This\nis borne out by the RMS errors given in the tables. This\nresult is to a certain extent artificial in that the basic water\ndepths were fixed at those used by XD98 in order to yield\na \u201dlike with like\u201d comparison. If gridding was performed\nbased on high\u2013resolution depths from a detailed survey of\nthe region (unfortunately not available), then a finer mesh\nin the shelf edge region with associated improved topog-\nraphy would be expected to improve the results. Improve-\nment of the barotropic tide in coastal regions as the finite\nelement resolution is improved has been found by a number\nof authors (e.g. Luettich Jr. and Westerink 1995).\n3.2. Baroclinic tidal current distribution\nIn these calculations the stratification corresponded to\nthe strongly stratified case described in XD98 (see Fig. 4 in\nXD98 for details), and the on\u2013\/off\u2013shelf motion of the tide\ngave rise to an internal tide in addition to the barotropic\ntide computed previously. The baroclinic tide was sepa-\nrated from the barotropic tide by subtracting the appro-\npriate barotropic tide\u2013only solution.\nThe computed cotidal chart (not shown) derived with\nbaroclinic effects included using the coarse mesh (Calc 3,\nTable 1) was not appreciably different to that found under\nhomogeneous conditions. A detailed comparison at obser-\nvation points showed differences of less than 1 cm and 1\ndegree, confirming as found by XD98, and in other papers,\nthat tidal elevation was dominated by the barotropic tide.\nThe surface baroclinic tidal current ellipse distribution\n(Fig. 5a) shows that the region of strongest generation is at\nthe shelf edge and in the region of the offshore sea\u2013mounts.\nThe internal tide generated at the shelf edge propagates\nboth onshelf and offshelf as described in XD98. The on\u2013\nshelf propagation of the internal tide is responsible for the\nappreciable signal to the east of the Hebrides. The pres-\nence of stratification influences the vertical eddy viscosity\nprofile and hence in shallower coastal regions it reduces the\nthickness of the turbulent bottom boundary layer. This in\nturn influences the barotropic tidal current profile which in\n5\nFig. 3. Fine irregular grid (G2) used in the calculations, with location of points used in time series comparisons. (For details of locations, see\ntext).\nshallow water is determined by bottom stress and viscous\neffects. A consequence of this is that the barotropic tidal\ncurrent computed with the present model is different from\nthat computed without stratification effects. Hence when\nthe two solutions are subtracted a barotropic tidal current\nremains in nearshore regions. These currents are not due to\npropagating internal tides but are just due to the difference\nin bottom stress and internal friction.\nA detailed comparison of tidal currents at observational\npoints (Table 3, Calc 3) shows that on the shelf, in the\nsouthern part of the region, namely locations A to G, the\nu and v currents are not substantially influenced by baro-\nclinic effects. However, away from the open boundaries in\nthe shelf edge region, namely locations M, N, W, J, K, H, I\n(see Fig. 1b in XD98 for locations), the internal tide would\nbe expected to have an effect. Comparison of the u cur-\nrent amplitude on the coarse grid including stratification\n(Table 3, Calc 3) and the homogeneous solution (Calc 1)\nshows that the internal tide enhances the vertical variation\nof current amplitude. A similar effect occurred for the v\ncomponent of velocity, with its magnitude increasing at a\nnumber of locations, see in particular position N, due to the\ngeneration of an along slope internal tide. The existence of\nan along slope internal tide clearly demonstrates the need\nto use a three\u2013dimensional model, and the limitations of\ncross slope \u201dslice\u201d models.\nFurther north at locations, P, Q, R, S and T (see Fig. 1b\nin XD98 for locations), the u current amplitude is smaller,\nwith the internal tide leading to an increase at some loca-\ntions (e.g. posn. S). A similar increase occurs in the am-\nplitude of the v current which is the dominant component\n(e.g. posn. S).\nIn a subsequent calculation (Calc 4, Table 1), the finer\nmesh (Fig. 3) was used to determine the baroclinic tide. As\npreviously, the tidal elevation was not significantly affected\nby the inclusion of stratification. As in Calc (3), the surface\ntidal current ellipse distribution (Fig. 5b) shows that the\ninternal tide is generated at the shelf edge and in regions\nof offshelf seamounts. The effect of the enhanced resolu-\ntion in regions of steep topography is to improve the accu-\nracy of the mesh resolution of bottom topography. Conse-\nquently the representation of topographic gradients is en-\nhanced with an associated increase in the detail of the in-\nternal tide in these areas (compare Figs. 5a, b). In addi-\ntion, a more accurate description of bottom topographic\ngradient influences the degree to which the tide is sub\u2013 or\nsuper\u2013critical and hence the extent of on\u2013shelf or off\u2013shelf\npropagation. In particular it is evident from the compari-\nson of Figs. 5a and b that the off\u2013shelf propagation of the\ninternal tide (to the west of the 1000 m contour) that is\nshown in Fig. 5b was not evident in Fig. 5a due to the\nlack of resolution in the region. The on\u2013shelf propagation\nis however evident in both figures. Similarly the enhanced\nresolution around oceanic topographic features that occurs\n6\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 4.

A detailed comparison of currents at observational\npoints (Calc 4, Table 3) shows that stratification effects ap-\npreciably influence both tidal current amplitude and pro-\nfile, besides its phase in shelf edge regions (compare Calcs\n2 and 4 in Table 3). Owing to the absence of a detailed\nknowledge of the stratification at the time when measure-\nments were made, a rigorous comparison is not possible. In\nthis paper, following XD98, an idealized profile of vertical\nstratification was used everywhere. As shown by XD98, us-\ning a range of density profiles, the spatial distribution of the\ninternal tide and its intensity and energy flux are sensitive\nto the stratification profile and without a detailed knowl-\nedge of this over the whole region, a rigorous comparison\nwith measurements such as those made by Sherwin (1988)\nis not possible. However, it is evident from a comparison\nof values in Table 3 (Calcs 3 and 4) that at locations M,\nN, W, J, K, H, I, the u current amplitude computed on\nthe finer grid is on average larger than on the coarse, with\na slight enhancement in vertical shear. This suggests that\nthe improved cross\u2013shelf resolution in the finer grid has in-\ntensified the across\u2013shelf internal tide due to an increased\nresolution in both its generation and propagation region. In\nthe latter case, an enhanced resolution would be expected\nto reduce artificial diffusion associated with internal tide\npropagation (see later Discussion). For the v component\nwhich is dominant at locations P, Q, R, S and T, enhanced\nresolution does not have a major effect. This is to be ex-\npected since this component is dominated by along\u2013shelf\npropagation which, due to its smaller lateral variation, is\nless sensitive to enhancement in grid resolution.\n3.3. Temporal and spatial variability of the baroclinic\ninternal tide\nIn the previous section the influence of grid resolution\nupon the spatial variability of the surface baroclinic tidal\ncurrents was examined in detail. Here we consider how it\ninfluences the temporal variability and profile of tidal cur-\nrents. To this end time series over two tidal cycles of the u\nand v components of the baroclinic tide both from west to\neast across the shelf edge, and from south to north along\nthe shelf edge at nodal locations along the lines shown in\nFigs. 2 and 3 are examined. Time series profiles from both\nthe coarse grid (Fig. 6a, b) and fine grid (Fig. 7a, b) are\nconsidered. They are presented in order from west to east,\nand then from south to north along the lines shown in Figs.\n2 and 3.\nIn deep water (h=1887 m and 1934 m) at the western\nedge of the model, the u and v profiles of the internal tide\ncomputed with either the coarse (Fig. 6a, b) or fine (Fig.\n7a, b) grid show similar time variations and profiles, with a\nslight enhancement in the nearbed region in the coarse com-\npared with fine grid model. In the region of the seamount\n(h=757 m and 1540 m), particularly at h=1540 m, both\nthe u and v current profile time series computed with the\nfine mesh model show (Fig. 7a, b) significant variations in\nthe vertical and with time. This appears to be associated\nwith the local production of internal tides in the region of\nthe seamount as discussed in XD98, and will be examined\nlater in connection with cross sections in this region. In the\ncoarse grid model the variation is significantly less (Fig. 6a,\nb), suggesting that this grid cannot adequately represent\ninternal tide production at the seamount.\nAt the two deep water positions (h=2171 m and 1912 m)\nbetween the seamount and the shelf edge, both grids give\nweak u baroclinic velocities (Figs. 6a and 7a), although the\nv component is much stronger and shows a surface intensi-\nfication and near\u2013surface phase shift. This suggests that in\nthis region the across\u2013shelf component of the internal tide\n(taken here as the u component) is weaker than the along\u2013\nshelf component. However, it is evident from the alignment\nof the topographic contours in the shelf break region (Fig.\n5b) that the shelf break changes its orientation in this re-\ngion giving rise to a significant v component of internal\n9\n(a)\nFig. 6.

For the\nv component there is an appreciable velocity (of order 15\ncm s\u22121) at both locations, although in the shallower region,\ncurrent velocities are slightly larger. Both the components\nof current computed with the finer mesh (Fig. 7a, b) are\nlarger than those determined with the coarse, and show sig-\nnificantly more vertical structure and phase change in the\nvertical. This suggests that in the shelf slope region there\nare multiple points at which the internal tide is being gen-\nerated that can be resolved on the finer mesh but not the\ncoarse. This will be considered later in connection with a\ndetailed examination of the cross shelf variation of the in-\nternal tide. On the shelf, at h=140 m and farther to the east\n(h=148 m), the u and v components computed with both\ngrids show similar current magnitudes and vertical profiles,\nsuggesting that the coarse grid model is sufficiently fine to\nresolve the on\u2013shelf propagation of the internal tide.\nIn the case of the along\u2013shelf variation of the internal\ntide, time series (namely the four locations along the 500 m\ncontour) show a significant change in both the u and v pro-\nfiles while on going from south to north, reflecting changes\nin the orientation of the shelf slope and its gradient. The\ndifferences between the two solutions appear slightly less\nat the northern than southern point, reflecting the broader\nshelf slope and hence smaller gradient. Obviously as the\nchange in topography is reduced, the ability of the coarse\ngrid model to resolve it and hence accuracy of the solution\nimproves.\nThis comparison of computed time series of the baroclinic\ntide from ocean to shelf in the region of a seamount and shelf\nslope shows that a fine grid is required both in the region\nof internal tide production (shelf slope) and propagation\n(both onshelf and offshelf) in order to adequately represent\nthe internal tide. In addition in areas of topographic change,\nnamely the seamount and orientation of the shelf slope, the\nbaroclinic tidal velocity is not always dominated by the u\ncomponent of current.\n4. Shelf edge cross\u2013section comparisons\n4.1. Influence of mesh resolution\nTo compare results in more detail with those derived us-\ning a uniform grid (XD98), and examine the influence upon\nthe internal tide of using two different mesh resolutions in\nthe shelf edge region, contours of the amplitude of the u\ncomponent of the baroclinic tide along cross sections C1,\nC2, C3 and D1, D2 (see Fig. 1 for latitude of these lines)\nwere examined. Distributions of u current amplitude across\nthese cross sections were examined in detail in XD98. To be\nconsistent with XD98, we will concentrate upon the upper\npart of the shelf slope and the adjacent shelf region along\nsections C1, C2 and C3. Along D1 and D2 we will exam-\nine the seamount and slope. Initially results are presented\nfrom the coarse grid solution (Fig. 2).\nContours of u current amplitude at cross section C1 (Fig.\n8a), show a minimum at about 11\u25e6W at a depth of 1100\nm, with amplitude increasing towards the sea surface. This\nis consistent with XD98, although in this case, there was a\nlocal minimum at this depth at about 10.5\u25e6W (see XD98,\nFig.13a). The rapid increase in amplitude close to the shelf\nedge, with a local maxima at about 700 m was also found in\nXD98. A reduction at midwater of tidal current on the shelf,\nand associated surface regions of enhanced tidal current\namplitude is also consistent with XD98. As shown in XD98\n(see their Fig. 3c) and in Davies and Kwong (2000), there\nis an appreciable along\u2013 and across\u2013shelf barotropic energy\nflux in this region, with the potential to generate an internal\ntide. Besides this, the vertical variation of stratification and\ngradient of topography is such that the components of the\nacross\u2013 and along\u2013shelf internal tidal forcing functions (Fx,\nFy) are large in the shelf edge region at cross section C1.\nA detailed discussion of this together with contours of Fx,\nFy are given in XD98 (see their Figs. 3d, e). The large\nvalues of Fx, Fy along the shelf slope at cross section C1\nexplains the strong baroclinic currents along the shelf slope.\nInternal tidal energy propagates vertically both onshore\nand offshore from its generation point, being reflected at\nthe sea surface and seabed, leading to regions of intensified\ncurrent magnitude (Fig. 8a). This is discussed in detail\nin XD98 where internal tide energy density contours are\npresented (see Fig. 13b in XD98).\nAt cross section C2, the region of minimum tidal current\nthat extends from sea surface to a depth of 1500 m at about\n10\u25e6W is consistent with that found in XD98. Also, the in-\ncrease in themagnitude to the west and east of this region as\nthe surface is approached was found in XD98. However, an\noceanic region (to west of 9\u25e6W) of surface\u2013enhanced tidal\ncurrent amplitude (exceeding 9 cm s\u22121) shown in XD98 is\nnot present. On the shelf regions of enhanced surface and\nnear bed velocity separated by a minimum are clearly evi-\ndent, although the intensity and lateral extent of these re-\ngions is less than that given in XD98. The reason for this\nis that the magnitude of the forcing functions Fx, Fy, and\nthe intensity of the energy flux beams depends upon the\ngradients of topography which are not as well resolved in\nthe coarse grid model as in XD98.\nAn oceanic surface layer of enhanced current amplitude\nwas not present at cross section C3 (Fig. 8c), although\nsuch a region was found by XD98. Although an area of en-\nhanced u surface current amplitude was found above the\nshelf break, the magnitude of currents in this region and\nalong the shelf edge (Fig. 8c) were below those found by\nXD98. Again this was related to lack of resolution in the\ncoarse mesh model.\nThese results suggest that the magnitude of the internal\ntidal currents particularly in the oceanic region, computed\nwith the coarse grid model, are below those found by XD98.\nTo see to what extent this conclusion is valid in the

At cross section D1n (Fig. 8d) in the re-\ngion above the seamount, the internal tide was a minimum\nat about 500 m below the surface. However, its value at this\nlocation rapidly increased as the surface was approached,\nreaching a surface maximum above the seamount in excess\nof 14 cm s\u22121. Similarly going from a depth of 500 m down\nto the top of the seamount, the magnitude of the u velocity\namplitude increased (Fig. 8d). The regions of maximum u\u2013\namplitude were also evident at depth and along the shelf\nslope. Small regions of local surface enhancement of u\u2013\namplitude are also evident above the shelf break. This sug-\ngests that local generation is occurring along the shelf slope\nand the slope associated with the seamount, with propaga-\ntion giving rise to regions of surface maximum. This spa-\ntial distribution of the internal tide, in particular the min-\nimum at 500 m in the region above the seamount, and the\nrapid increase above this point as the surface is approached\nis consistent with the results presented in XD98. However,\nXD98 found a more rapid increase in u\u2013amplitude on going\nfrom z=500 m down to the top of the seamount than that\nfound here. In addition an extensive region of enhanced sur-\nface u\u2013current amplitude occurred rather than the limited\nregion shown in Fig. 8d.\nTo examine to what extent the solution was sensitive to\nthe exact position of the cross\u2013section, Fig. 8e shows con-\ntours along a cross section (D1c) slightly to the south of\nD1n. It is evident from Fig. 8d and e that although moving\nfarther south has only a slight influence upon the distribu-\ntion of topography, in particular a slight broadening of the\ntop of the seamount, it has an appreciable effect upon the\namplitude of the internal tidal current above the seamount.\nAlthough just above the seamount there is still a minimum\nat z=500 m, the amplitude increases rapidly with distance\nabove and below this location. A local maximum at z=700\nm occurs just above the seamount as found in XD98. In ad-\ndition, the region of surface u current amplitude maximum\nincreases compared to Fig. 6d, although its lateral extent\nis still below that found in XD98.\nAt cross section D1s, situated at the southern edge of\nthe seamount, its height is appreciably less than at D1c,\nand there is only a slight increase in u\u2013amplitude above\nthe seamount. However, a local increase along the eastern\nedge of the seamount and along the continental slope par-\nticularly at depth as found at cross section D1c, is evident\n(Fig. 8f). These changes in internal tidal current magnitude\nin the region of the seamount can be related to the spatial\nvariations in the forcing functions Fx, Fy in the seamount\nregion (see XD98).\nThese calculations clearly show that in the region of the\nAnton Dohrn Seamount, the cross\u2013shelf variation of the in-\nternal tide is particularly sensitive to location relative to\nthe peak of the seamount. Although XD98 never examined\nthis sensitivity, they performed calculations with and with-\nout the seamount (see Fig. 17 in XD98) and showed the\nimportance of the seamount in determining the distribu-\ntion of the internal tide in this region. The calculations of\nforcing functions Fx, Fy (see Fig. 3d, e in XD98 for detail)\nand energy flux vectors (see Fig. 3c in XD98) showed that\nboth across\u2013 and along\u2013shelf components of the internal\ntide were generated in this region. Since the distribution\nand magnitude of Fx, Fy depends on topographic slope,\nthe variations in this slope in the seamount region will in-\nfluence the internal tide distribution. The differences in the\nability of the finite element mesh or finite difference grid to\nreproduce this slope will influence the distribution of the\ninternal tide in this region. This explains in part the differ-\nences in u\u2013amplitude between the present model and those\npresented in XD98 in the region of this seamount.\nFurther south at cross section D2 (Fig. 1) corresponding\nto the Hebrides Terrace Seamount, u\u2013amplitude contours\nshow (Fig. 8g) a surface and sea bed maximum in the re-\ngion of the seamount. A local maximum along the conti-\nnental slope also occurs at a depth of 1000 m (Fig. 8g). The\nlocation of these maxima is consistent with that given in\nXD98. As at other cross sections and as found by XD98,\nsurface and bed current maxima occur in the region of the\nshelf slope.\nTo examine in detail to what extent the internal tide is\ninfluenced by resolution, comparable cross\u2013section plots to\nthose shown in Fig. 8 computed with the finer grid (Fig. 3)\nare presented in Fig. 9. Considering initially cross section\nC1. Although refining the grid does not substantially af-\nfect the large\u2013scale features of the internal tide distribution\n(compare Figs. 8a and 9a), it does increase the u\u2013amplitude\nparticularly in the surface layer and along the shelf slope.\nConsidering initially the oceanic (west of 10\u25e6W) distribu-\ntion in Fig. 9a. Although the minimum that occurs at 1000\nm is consistent with that found in Fig. 8a, it is evident that\namplitude increases more rapidly in Fig. 9a, than Fig. 8a,\nas the surface is approached. This gives rise to a significant\nincrease in the surface layer over which the amplitude ex-\nceeds 5 cm s\u22121 (Fig. 9a) compared to Fig. 8a, and is con-\nsistent with XD98. Similarly local surface and bed maxima\noccur at about 9.5\u25e6W, associated with the shelf break re-\ngion (Fig. 9a), that were not present previously (Fig. 8a).\nSome indication of these can be found in XD98, although\nthe grid resolution of that model was insufficient to repre-\nsent them in detail. Regions of local maxima in the near\nbed region both on the shelf and along the shelf slope that\ncould not be adequately resolved previously (Fig. 8a) are\nevident in Fig. 9a, with amplitude increased above that\nfound in XD98 due to improved resolution.\nA significant increase in amplitude and lateral extent of\nthe region of u surface current in proximity of the shelf\nbreak is clearly evident in Fig. 9b compared to Fig. 8b, due\nto enhanced resolution in the shelf slope and offshelf region\n16\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFig. 8. Contours of the amplitude (cm s\u22121) of the u component of the baroclinic tidal current at cross sections a C1, b C2, c C3, d D1n, e\nD1c, f D1s and g D2, computed with the coarse grid (Fig. 2) with C=0.28.\nin the fine (Fig. 3) compared to the coarse (Fig. 2) grids.\nIn addition on the shelf in the region adjacent to the shelf\nbreak, the magnitude of surface and near bed maxima (Fig.\n7b) are increased beyond those found with the coarser grid\n(Fig. 8b) and given in XD98. Similarly at depth (z=1200\nm) along the shelf slope there is a region of local intensifi-\ncation (Fig. 9b) that did not occur previously (Fig. 8b) and\nalthough present in XD98, was under\u2013resolved and spread\nin the horizontal.\nA similar increase in the shelf edge and offshelf surface\ncurrent maxima occurs along cross section C3 in the fine\ncompared with coarse grid calculation (compare Figs. 9c\nand 8c). However, these values are still below those ob-\nserved by Sherwin (1988) in this region. This may be due in\npart to the fact that Sherwins observations were at slightly\ndifferent locations (of order 50 km away) and this will in-\nfluence comparisons in regions of high spatial variability.\nThe existence of multiple surface maxima in the shelf edge\nregion is shown in XD98, although their magnitude is less,\nand their lateral extent larger, suggesting that the internal\nwave energy that propagates into the ocean in the XD98\ncalculations may have spread in the horizontal. In theory\nthe internal tide propagates offshore along ray paths which\nmust be resolved on the grid. If lateral resolution in the\nocean is coarse (Fig. 2), then these ray paths are not re-\nsolved and energy is not focused along well\u2013defined beams.\nWith improved resolution (XD98) compared to the coarse\ngridmodel (Fig. 2), the ray paths are better represented and\nregions of surface maxima are resolved, although there can\nbe some lateral spreading. With enhanced resolution (be-\nyond that in XD98) (Fig. 3), ray paths and regions of sur-\nface intensification are resolved. In addition, with enhanced\nhorizontal resolution, the shelf slope can bemore accurately\nresolved provided a detailed depth survey is available to\nmatch the grid resolution. As shown by Xing and Davies\n(1999), as smaller scale cross\u2013shelf variations of topography\nare resolved along the shelf edge, the number of internal\ntide generation points increases leading to a significantly\nmore complex cross\u2013shelf distribution of the internal tide.\nIn the case of the along\u2013shelf variation of the internal tide,\nLegg (2004a) showed a local intensification of the nearbed\ninternal tide on the same length scale as the along\u2013shelf\ncorrugations in topography. This suggests that to repro-\nduce these small\u2013scale variations, the mesh size needs to be\nsignificantly smaller than the dominant length scale, of the\nfine scale undulations in topography. Differences in inter-\nnal tidal current magnitude compared with Sherwin (1988)\nwill also be due to the differences in the density field, sug-\ngesting that for a detailed model\/data comparison an ex-\ntensive survey of the density field with sufficient resolution\n17\n(e) (f)\n(g)\nFig. 8. (Contd.)\nto match the model grid is required. However, as shown by\nXing and Davies (1997c) short\u2013term wind effects can mod-\nify the density field and thereby influence the internal tide\nand its interaction with the wind (Davies and Xing 2003).\nThe presence of a region of enhanced current amplitude\nalong the shelf slope (Fig. 9c) computed with the finer grid\ncompared to previously (Fig. 8c) further illustrates the ben-\nefits of using enhanced resolution in the shelf slope region.\nThis bed enhancement was also found in XD98 with their\nfinite difference grid.\nThe internal tide at cross section D1n (Fig. 9d) computed\nwith the finer grid shows a significantly larger surface and\nbed enhancement in current amplitude above the seamount\n(Fig. 9d) than found previously (Fig. 8d). Also the lateral\nextent of the region of enhanced u surface current amplitude\n(Fig. 9d) exceeds that computed with the coarser resolution\n(Fig. 8d).\nFurther south at cross section D1c, again above the\nseamount there are regions of surface and nearbed en-\nhancement of current magnitude separated by a region at\nabout z=500 m where the magnitude is a minimum (Fig.\n9e). In addition, surface current magnitude in the region\nbetween the shelf break and the surface maximum above\nthe seamount is enhanced above that found in the coarser\ngrid solution (Fig. 8e). The magnitude of the maximum\ncurrents in this surface layer exceed those given in XD98,\nwhere the region of maximum surface currents was spread\nover a larger area. The region of rapid spatial variability\nin amplitude contours on the eastern side of the seamount\nwas not found in XD98 probably due to lack of resolution\nin this area.\nContours of current amplitude in the near bed region\nboth along the eastern side of the seamount and in the shelf\nslope region show significant small\u2013scale variability, sug-\ngesting that these boundary layers cannot be adequately\nresolved. The inability of the model to resolve these bound-\nary layers gives rise to a Gibbs type effect and an increase in\nenergy on a length scale comparable to the mesh size in the\nmodel. This effect was found by HD05 in the wind\u2013forced\ninternal wave field on an irregular grid, and could only be re-\nmoved by increasing the coefficient (C) in the Smagorinsky\nformulation of horizontal momentum diffusion. The effect\nof changing this coefficient is examined in the next section.\nContours of tidal current amplitude at cross section D1s\nshow (Fig. 9f) similar large\u2013scale features to those along\nD1c, (Fig. 9e). However, significantly smaller scale (of the\norder of the grid scale) oscillations of a nonphysical nature\nare present. As with cross section D1c, the influence of the\nSmagorinsky coefficient C upon these will be examined in\nthe next section.\nThe effect of refining the grid in the region of cross sec-\ntion D2 is to increase the amplitude above the seamount in\n18\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFig. 9. As Fig. 8, but for the fine grid (Fig. 3) with C=0.28.\nthe nearbed region (Fig. 9g) compared to the coarser grid\nsolution (Fig. 8g). The corresponding maximum at the sur-\nface does, however, show small\u2013scale variability (Fig. 9g)\ncompared to that found previously (Fig. 8g). The surface\nmaximum above the shelf break, and the local maximum at\na depth z=1000 m along the shelf slope (Fig. 9g) are signif-\nicantly larger than found previously (Fig. 8g) or in XD98,\nreflecting the improved resolution in the present calcula-\ntion. The influence of increasing C upon the current distri-\nbution along cross section D2 will be examined in the next\nsection.\n4.2. Influence of coefficient C upon baroclinic tidal\ncurrent distribution\nIn this calculation (Calc 5, Table 1) the fine grid distribu-\ntion was used, although the coefficient C in the Smagorin-\nsky formulation of horizontal viscosity was doubled from\nits previous value to C=0.56. Along cross section C1 the ef-\nfect of increasing C had little effect upon the distribution of\ntidal current amplitude contours (not shown), except for a\nslight reduction in maximum values in the near bed region\nalong the shelf slope. At this cross section the tidal current\nshows a fairly smooth change (Fig. 9a) from ocean to shelf\nthat appears to be well resolved. At cross section C2, away\nfrom the shelf break and shelf slope a fairly smooth varia-\ntion of tidal current amplitude occurs which is not signifi-\ncantly influenced by the increase in C (compare Figs. 10a\nand 9b). However, at the shelf break and particularly along\nthe shelf slope at z=1200 m, there are some rapid small\u2013\nscale changes on the grid scale of the model in the tidal\ncurrent amplitude above the bottom boundary layer (Fig.\n9b). These appear to be physically unrealistic in that there\nare no small\u2013scale variations in bottom topography in this\nregion. Also they appear just above the bottom boundary\nlayer and suggest a Gibbs type numerical problem in fitting\na relatively smooth current profile to a high sheared bottom\nboundary layer. If they are physically realistic, and due to\nwave trapping or reflection they are of such a small scale\nthat they cannot be accurately resolved on the present grid\nand need to be removed by a scale\u2013selective filter, before\nthey destabilize the solution (see HD05 for more details of\nthe numerical problem). The effect of increasing C is to re-\nmove these ripples giving rise to a smoother and resolvable\ndistribution (compare Fig. 9b and Fig.10a). A similar ef-\nfect of increasing C was found along cross section C3, (not\nshown) where small\u2013scale inadequately resolved variations\nalong the shelf slope were removed.\nIn the region of the Anton Dohrn Seamount, considered\nhere in terms of cross sections D1c and D1s, the effect of\nincreasing C is to reduce the small\u2013scale variations along\nthe eastern side of the seamount and the shelf slope (com-\n19\n(e) (f)\n(g)\nFig. 9. (Contd.)\npare Fig. 9e, f with Fig. 10b, c). Although increasing C in\nthis case does reduce the small ripples, leaving the large\u2013\nscale features essentially unchanged, it is evident from Fig.\n10b, c that some small\u2013scale spatial variability does remain.\nThis may be realistic in that as shown by Xing and Davies\n1997a, 1999, small\u2013scale topographic features along shelf\nslopes give rise to the local regions of internal tide genera-\ntion. In this case a further grid refinement to that shown in\nFig. 3 is required to increase the accuracy of the solution\nin these regions.\nIn a final comparison, cross section D2 was examined. As\npreviously the increase in C removed small\u2013scale features\nparticularly along the shelf slope region (compare Fig. 10d\nand 9g) without affecting the large\u2013scale pattern. Obvi-\nously to improve the accuracy of the solution in the region\nof rapid changes in shelf slope, a finer horizontal grid would\nbe required.\n5. Concluding remarks\nThe QUODDY finite element code with both a coarse\nand fine grid (in which the grid was refined in the shelf slope\nregion) has been used to compute the three\u2013dimensional\nbaroclinic tide in the Malin-Hebrides shelf edge region off\nthe west coast of Scotland. This region was chosen because\nit has a significant internal tide and was the area of a recent\nmeasurement study. In addition the internal tide besides\nbeing generated along the shelf slope is also produced along\nthe slope associated with two offshelf seamounts. These ad-\nditional sources of the internal tide, plus spatial variations\nin the orientation and slope of the shelf edge provide a good\ntest of a variable resolution grid model. A detailed solution\nis also available from a regular grid finite difference model\nof the region (XD98) with which irregular grid solutions\ncan be compared.\nInitial calculations showed that for the three\u2013dimensional\nbarotropic tide there were no substantial differences be-\ntween the coarse or fine grid solutions and that of XD98.\nThis can be understood in terms of the long wavelength of\nthe barotropic tide and that it is accurately resolved with\nall grid resolutions used. When stratification was included\nit had a negligible effect upon surface elevation, although\na baroclinic internal tide was produced. The spatial distri-\nbution of surface baroclinic tidal current ellipses showed\nthat it was primarily generated along the shelf edge and in\nthe region of the seamounts, with some propagation away\nfrom its generation region. A more detailed discussion of\nthis with appropriate energy flux vectors and distributions\nis given in XD98. Comparison of time series of baroclinic\ntidal current profiles over two tidal cycles from west to east\nalong a cross section through the Anton Dohrn Seamount,\nand from south to north along the 500 m depth contour\n20\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFig. 10. As Fig. 9, but at cross sections a C2, b D1c, c D1s and d D2, with C=0.56.\nshowed significant spatial variability. At some locations\ndifferences between the coarse and fine grid solutions were\nevident. The differences between the solutions and that\ngiven by XD98 were quantified by comparison with current\nobservations in the region.\nTo examine the effect of grid resolution in more detail,\ncontours of u\u2013current amplitude of the baroclinic tide were\nplotted along the same cross sections as in XD98. These\nshowed that the coarse grid solution could not reproduce\nthe surface intensification of the internal tide or the re-\ngions of local generation along shelf slopes. However, the\nsurface intensification was reproduced with the finer grid\nmodel which showed regions of stronger intensification than\nthose found by XD98. This suggests that the finer mesh\nfinite element model is more accurate in generating and\npropagating the internal tide than the finite difference grid\nused in XD98. However, in some generation regions, along\nsteep slopes there appeared to be some physically unrealis-\ntic small\u2013scale waves in the finite element model that had\nto be removed by increasing the coefficient in the Smagorin-\nsky formulation of horizontal eddy viscosity.\nThe intercomparison of the finite element model with two\ndifferent horizontal grid resolutions and the finite difference\nmodel of XD98 presented here demonstrates a number of\npoints. In particular, it shows that the finite element model\ncan reproduce the internal tide off the west coast of Scot-\nland, provided a sufficiently fine grid is used in the gener-\nation regions, and the adjacent sea regions into which the\ninternal tide propagates. The ability to refine the mesh in\nregions where higher resolution is required is a major ad-\nvantage over a regular grid. However, a rapid local refine-\nment as shown by HD05 can affect internal wave propaga-\ntion leading to increased energy at small scales that must\nbe removed by an enhancement of a local scale\u2013selective\nfilter such as the Smagorinsky form of horizontal viscosity.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are indebted to Mrs L.
