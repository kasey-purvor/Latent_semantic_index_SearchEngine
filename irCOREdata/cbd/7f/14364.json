The MLE brings\ntogether multimedia technology and Intelligent Tutoring Systems techniques for the purpose of\ndeveloping in the graduate engineer the skills and understanding needed to produce initial design\nproposals for real-world dam spillway design problems.\nIntroduction\nUnderlying our approach to the development of a Multimedia Learning Environment\n(MLE) is the proposition that conventional learning needs analysis, for Computer-Based\nLearning does not address the richness of delivery possible with MLEs. We propose that\nknowledge-engineering techniques (from the field of Artificial Intelligence) can provide a\nricher understanding of the domain, thus enabling a better MLE to be produced.\nThe knowledge-engineering approach we have used, outlined in this paper, involved\nacquiring knowledge from a range of sources, then analysing this knowledge so that\nindividual knowledge items could be categorized according to identified underlying\nknowledge-representation paradigms which each imply their own, most suitable,\npresentation style. This knowledge engineering analysis was then used to select an\ninstructional model capable of conveying all the acquired types of knowledge in their\nparadigmatic styles, and detailed and adaptable enough to be implemented on a\ncomputer. The chosen model, the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model (CAM), was explicitly\nused as the basis for the architecture of the MLE.\nThis paper is intended to demonstrate the validity of our approach. It concentrates on\n29\nChris Smith and PeterJogodzinski The implementation of a multimedia learning environment\nhow the acquired knowledge and its representation styles map onto the CAM, the\ndevelopment of an architecture for the MLE, and how the core elements of the CAM can\nbe implemented within the MLE.\nKnowledge acquisition\nThe developers, who are not civil engineers, were able to compare objectively the relative\nmerits of the three distinct views of the domain knowledge and learning needs proposed\nby different categories of expert:\n(a) The Journeyman. The expert for this part of the process was a post-doctoral research\nfellow with several years' of recent experience in hydropower design. The first part of the\nknowledge acquisition process involved this 'Journeyman' explaining an example design\nproblem involving the design of an energy-dissipation device for a dam spillway that was\ntaken from The Design of Small Dams (US Bureau of Reclamation, 1987,400-402).\n(b) The Master. Secondly, we referred to a 'Master', a professor of civil engineering, for\nconfirmation and higher levels of abstraction of knowledge.\n(c) The Industry. Thirdly, we were influenced by our discussions with industry and ICE\ntraining managers, who identified a number of practical learning needs relating to job\nperformance in the context of the real world.\nIn addition, a number of research studies and models of the design process were examined\n(Jeffries et al, 1981, Ullman et al, 1988, and Ball, 1990) to provide confirmation for and\na more detailed and comprehensive characterization of the design strategies that seemed\nto be employed by the Journeyman as he solved the example design problem.\nKnowledge representation paradigms underlying the acquired\nknowledge\nAnalysis of the acquired knowledge determined that it could be categorized under three\nbroad classes of representation paradigm:\n1. Symbolic (elicited from the Journeyman and confirmed by the Master)\n(a) The conceptual and factual knowledge of natural phenomena and engineered\nstructures which can be effectively expressed as equations, graphs or rules to show the\nrelationships between the values involved.\n(b) The procedural knowledge of, for example, the steps needed to solve an equation or\nthe steps involved in deriving an equation.\n2. Experiential\n(a) Knowledge and intuitive understanding of complex real-world physical phenomena\nwhich can most easily be understood through some physical sensory process, for example\nthe erodability of a stream bed or the buildability of a concrete form.\n30\nALT-] Volume 3 Number I\n(b) Intuitive understanding of values, relationships and abstract theoretical constructs\n(which may not be observable in the real world) which can be expressed symbolically but\nwhich are hard to grasp unless they can be sensorily experienced, for example the force of\n1,000 cubic meters of water flowing down a spillway, the kinetic energy of water before\nand after a hydraulic jump, or the triangle of forces.\nType (a) was disclosed by the Master, and type (b) was stressed by both the Master and\nthe Journeyman.\n3. Metacognitive, i.e. the framework within which the symbolic and experiential\nknowledge is applied in order to accomplish a task.\n(a) High-level project structuring metacognitive knowledge, i.e. knowledge that enables\nthe engineer to identify and sequence project activities to provide an activity network for,\nsay, a two-year project. The importance of this type of knowledge was emphasized by\nindustry practitioners.\n(b) Lower-level (applicable over a shorter time frame, say one day) knowledge of\nstrategies and heuristics which are needed to be able to apply the symbolic and\nexperiential knowledge so that a small task within the project life-cycle can be\naccomplished. These strategies were elicited from the Journeyman during his solution of\nthe example design problem, and were confirmed from examination of models of the\nengineering design process.\nRepresentation styles required by the three categories of knowledge\nEach category of knowledge seems most suited to particular methods of presentation:\nSymbolic knowledge (for example mathematical relationships between flow rates and\nspillway dimensions) needs to be expressed in symbolic terms, i.e. equations or rules.\nHowever, much symbolic knowledge can often also be expressed using experiential\ntechniques such as those involving simulation, animation, video and still images, so that it\nbecomes understandable at an intuitive level through sensory experience.\nMetacognitive knowledge is often learnt through experience, for example the patterns of\nprocedures and approaches which best suit particular real-world problems. Although it\nwould be possible to teach such strategies and heuristics as rules (i.e. symbolically), in\nreality a thorough understanding of the subtleties and variations of strategy is acquired\nonly through experience. Such experience can be offered on computer by simulating real-\nworld problem-solving.\nExperiential knowledge can thus be seen not as a separate category but as an important\nalternative perspective on symbolic and metacognitive knowledge which enables these to\nbe understood intuitively as well as formally.\nA more detailed account of knowledge elicitation and analysis is given in Jagodzinski et\nal. (1994).\n31\nChris Smith and Peter Jagodzinsti The implementation of a multimedia learning environment\nA simplified outline of some of the major elements of the CAM\nIn order to provide an effective, integrated learning experience, a suitable psychologically\nrecognized, coherent and comprehensive framework was required. After reviewing several\napproaches, such a framework was found in the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model (CAM)\ndeveloped by Collins et al. (1989) and Collins (1991). The CAM is an adaptation of the\ntraditional approach of craft apprenticeship for skill-learning into methods for teaching\nand learning the reasoning and problem-solving cognitive skills of a domain. Its main\nelements are listed in Table 1.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\nContent\n1.1 Domain knowledge\n1.2 Heuristic strategies\n1.3 Control strategies\n1.4 Learning strategies\nModelling and explaining\n2.1 Modelling of real-world processes\n2.2 Modelling of expert performance\nSituated learning\nCoaching\nScaffolding\nFading\nArticulation\nReflection\nExploration\n10.1 Increasing complexity\n10.2 Increasing diversity\n10.3 Global before local skills Table I: Elements of the Cognitive\nApprenticeship Model (CAM)\nThe knowledge content of the CAM approach is defined in the first two of its elements, as\nshown in Figure 1 which illustrates way in which the acquired knowledge and its\nrepresentation styles map onto the CAM. Domain knowledge (1.1) corresponds with\nconventional declarative text-book knowledge, and 1.2 to 2.2, various aspects of\nprocedural knowledge including problem solving strategies and modelling real-world\nperformance. Together, these two aspects of the CAM are able to comprehend the type of\nknowledge representation required by the domain of dam spillway design.\nThe instructional process of the CAM (elements 3 to 10 in Table 1) conveys metacognitive\nknowledge and improves understanding of the symbolic and its related experiential\nknowledge by placing all teaching within the context of real-world problem solving. This is\naccomplished by having the tutor first model the whole solution to a problem (element 2.2\nin Table 1). Then work begins on a similar problem with the tutor carrying out some parts\nof the problem and the learner attempting the other parts of it. Work continues on similar\n32\nVolume 3 Number I\nDomain of a dam spillway design\nExperiential\n(a) dynamic, complex\nreal-world physical\nphenomenon\n(b) values, relationships and\nabstract theoretical\nconstructs\nMetacognitive \")\n*^^_ __^-\u2014\nCAM\n1.

Modelling of expert\nperformance\nFigure I: How the knowledge representation paradigms of the domain of dam spillway design map\nonto the types of knowledge recognized by the CAM\nnew problems with the learner taking on as much of the new problem as possible, as soon\nas possible, until he or she can comfortably solve a whole problem on his or her own.\nHaving the tutor carry out parts of the problem is termed 'scaffolding' (element 5 in Table\n1) within the CAM, and having learners take on more and more of the problem by\nthemselves is known as 'fading' the scaffolding (element 6 in Table 1). The CAM offers\nguidance on the provision and removal of scaffolding. Initially, support should be offered\nto learners to relieve them of the lower-level skills needed to perform a complex task so that\nthey first examine, practise and learn the higher-level reasoning skills necessary to carry out\nthe task. They thus develop a conceptual map of the overall activity (which is also gained\nfrom modelling) before they go on to develop specific skills. This is known as teaching\n'global before local' skills (element 10.3 in Table 1). The CAM also suggests that coaching\n(element 4 in Table 1) should be provided. This involves monitoring learners as they work,\nand offering hints, scaffolding, feedback, modelling, reminders, and new tasks, all of which\nare intended to move their performance closer to the performance of an expert.\n33\nChris Smith and Peter Jagpdzinsti The implementation of a multimedia learning environment\nThe way in which these core CAM elements of modelling, coaching, scaffolding and\nfading can be provided by the MLE will be discussed below. A detailed examination of\nthe other important aspects of the CAM is given in Brown and Newman (1989) and\nCollins (1991).\nAn architecture for the MLE\nFigure 2 provides a schematic overview of the components of the MLE.\nThe 'coach' first models the expert solution of a problem. The learner is shown the\nsolution sequentially, a page at a time. Pages already seen can be re-examined by being\n'Shelves' D\nCoaching\nBooks & Coached Examples\nVisuarcard Index*\nReference\n'Books*\n'\u2022s\nDeclarative\nknowledge\n-A Author\n'Card Index*\nproject\ndocumentation\n1 per problem\nattempt\nSubject\n'Card Index*\nExample problems\nvarious versions -\nvit h differing levels\nof scaffolding\nActive Passive\nFigure 2: MLE architecture the text\n34\nALT-] Volume 3 Number I\nscrolled through. After being shown how to solve a problem, the learner can then\nsequentially work his or her way through a similar type of problem but one which uses\ndifferent values. The system will support the learner by alternately demonstrating the\nsolution to part of the problem and then asking him or her to attempt part of the problem,\nand so on. This is done according to the 'global before local' sequencing of skills.\nAs a case study problem is worked through, values are filled in on examples of project\ndocumentation held within the 'project folder'. This provides students with a correct\nmodel of the appropriate ways of recording their findings. 'Books' of reference material\nare referred to in the 'coach' to provide background understanding for learners and to\nhelp them complete their parts of the task. The 'books' are structured and contain\norganized multimedia explanations and demonstrations of symbolic and related\nexperiential knowledge which can be used to solve many different types of problem (see\nFigure 3 for examples). 'Books' are referenced within 'card indexes' and the coached\nexamples themselves are also initially taken from an 'index'. All 'books', 'coached\nexamples' and 'indexes' are available on a number of'shelves'.\nAfter completing a section, learners ask for it to be evaluated. If they have done badly,\nthey can be helped. For example, the system can demonstrate the solution to that section,\nand levels of demonstration with varying detail can also be shown. If learners reach an\nimpasse, they can, again, be given similar help. How well a learner does overall on a run-\nthrough determines how much of the scaffolding is faded for the next coached\nrun-through of a similar problem with different values.\nThe Coach\nThe following is a simplified outline of the underlying architecture and mechanisms\nneeded to implement the CAM's core elements of modelling, coaching, scaffolding and\nfading.\nModelling\nEach of the tasks in Figure 4, which shows the decomposition of a typical problem into\nindividual steps, would be represented as a node within the system. Each node has a set of\n'system demonstration' pages and a set of 'student work-through' pages associated with\nit. The system demonstration pages illustrate how an expert would solve the task, and the\nstudent work-through pages invite students to solve the task for themselves. Initially, the\nexpert's solution to the problem, using a particular set of values, is modelled. This is\naccomplished by using a stack to deliver the system demonstration pages for each node,\nin turn, i.e. a, b, c, d, e and f.\nScaffolding and fading\nEach leaf node in Figure 4 (b, d, e and f) also has an evaluation procedure, a student score\nand a difficulty rating and sequence ranking (see Figure 5). A task's difficulty rating is a\nmeasure of how complex and time-consuming a task is to complete. The task sequence\nrankings are used in the process of allocating the next task to be attempted by the student.\n35\nChris Smith and Peter Jagpdzinski The implementation of a multimedia learning environment\nLook and feel of a real book.

For example, in one of our civil engineering\nproblems, different types of spillway stilling basin may need to be considered.\nWhen 'scaffolding', the system will demonstrate some parts of the problem, and the\nlearner will attempt other parts of the problem. The basic method for allocating tasks to\nthe learner uses the students scores, difficulty ratings and sequence rankings:\n\u2022 Leaf nodes are ordered according to their sequence rankings and difficulty ratings:\nf (SR = 1, DR = 40), e (SR = 2, DR = 10), d (SR = 2, DR = 20), b (SR = 3, DR = 30).\n\u2022 Say 50% of the given problem (in terms of difficulty) is to be allocated to the learner on\nDR = 30\nDR = 20\nSR = 2\nf DR = 40SR=1\nDR - Difficulty Rating, SR - Sequence Ranking\nA 'real' problem would include many more task nodes.\nFigure 5: Design problem nodes with example difficulty ratings and sequence rankings\n37\nChris Smith and Peter jagpdzinski The implementation of a multimedia learning environment\nthe next run-through (the higher a learner's overall score on a run-through, the more\nof the problem he or she will have to attempt on the next run-through).\n\u2022 50% of the total difficulty of the whole problem is calculated, i.e. 50 (in this case). So, a\nnumber of tasks with a difficulty totalling 50 (or as close to it as possible without\nexceeding it) will have their node settings set to show student work-through pages.\nThus, during the run-through, at these points, the student will be asked to attempt\nthose tasks on his or her own.\n\u2022 The first tasks whose difficulty ratings total 50, or as near as possible to 50, are\nallocated to the student according to his or her sequence rankings. So, on the next run-\nthrough, nodes f (SR = 1, DR = 40) and e (SR = 2, DR = 10) will be allocated to the\nstudent to attempt.\n\u2022 The sequence rankings are intended to deliver the CAM'S 'global before local'\nsequencing because the centrally important guiding tasks and decisions will be given\nhigher sequence rankings in order to ensure that students will practise them earlier.\nCoaching\nEach section attempted by a student is evaluated. If the student does badly on a section,\nhe or she can be shown the system demonstration pages for the node concerned, its child\nnodes and so on (varying demonstration\/help pages can be given depending on the errors\nmade). If a student is unable to continue on a section, again he or she can be shown the\nsystem demonstration pages for the node concerned and its child nodes (and, again,\nvarying demonstration\/hint pages can be given depending on the experience of the\nstudent, for example how much of the problem he or she has been allocated).\nConclusion\nOur use of a knowledge-engineering approach to the development of multimedia learning\nenvironments has brought four benefits:\n1. Recognition of the need for a range of domain expertise.\n2. A richer perception of the learning domain - three categories of knowledge have been\nrecognized, and the importance of experiential knowledge in particular has been an\nunexpected revelation.\n3. A set of paradigms for the representation of knowledge in the architecture of the MLE.\n4. A basis for selecting an instructional model for the architecture of the MLE which is\ncapable of integrating and delivering the different types of knowledge in their most\nappropriate representation styles.\nThe CAM model has been of enormous value in providing us with a clear and detailed\nrationale for the way in which material is presented to learners, for the modelling of their\nperformance and for the interaction between these two elements.\nThe premise of this research was that careful attention to design can unlock the potential\n38\nALT-J. Volume 3 Number I\nof multimedia as a learning tool. We believe that we have shown that the approaches we\nhave used are capable of facilitating a penetrating understanding of a learning domain,\nand consequently a rich design which situates the learning environment in the context of\nrealistic problem-solving.\nReferences\nBall, L.J.
