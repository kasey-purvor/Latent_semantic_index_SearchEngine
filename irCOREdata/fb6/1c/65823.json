INTRODUCTION\nThe success of Kohn-Sham density functional theory1,2\n\u0001DFT\u0002 relies on the accurate representation of the exchange-\ncorrelation energy EXC. Significant insight into this quantity\nis obtained from the adiabatic connection \u0001AC\u0002,3\u201310 which\nconsiders a series of N-electron systems with Hamiltonians\nH\u02c6 \u0001 = T\u02c6 + \u0001V\u02c6 ee + \u0005\ni\nv\u0001\u0001ri\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere T\u02c6 is the electronic kinetic energy operator and \u0001 is a\ncoupling strength parameter that scales the electron-electron\ninteraction, V\u02c6 ee=\u0005i\u0002j1\/rij. The final term is the external po-\ntential, which is varied so as to keep the density fixed at its\nphysical value.5 The AC smoothly connects the Kohn-Sham\nnoninteracting system \u0001\u0001=0\u0002 to the interacting physical sys-\ntem \u0001\u0001=1\u0002 and, through the Hellmann-Feynman theorem,\nprovides an exact expression for the exchange-correlation\nenergy,\nEXC = \u0006\n0\n1\nd\u0001W\u0001, \u00012\u0002\nwhere\nW\u0001 = \u0007\u0003\u0001\b\u0005\ni\u0002j\n1\nrij\n\b\u0003\u0001\t \u2212 J . \u00013\u0002\nHere, \u0003\u0001 is the ground state wave function of the system\nwith Hamiltonian H\u02c6 \u0001, and J is the Coulomb energy,\nJ =\n1\n2 \u0006 \u0006 dr1dr2\u0004\u0001r1\u0002\u0004\u0001r2\u0002r12 , \u00014\u0002\nwhere \u0004\u0001r\u0002 is the electron density. When \u0001=0, the wave\nfunction is the noninteracting Kohn-Sham single determinant\n\u00030, so\nW0 = \u0007\u00030\b\u0005\ni\u0002j\n1\nrij\n\b\u00030\t \u2212 J = EX, \u00015\u0002\nwhere EX is the exact orbital exchange energy, defined as in\nHartree-Fock theory but evaluated using Kohn-Sham orbit-\nals. When \u0001=1, the wave function is the exact wave function\nof the interacting physical system, \u00031, so\nW1 = \u0007\u00031\b\u0005\ni\u0002j\n1\nrij\n\b\u00031\t \u2212 J = Vee \u2212 J , \u00016\u0002\nwhich is the difference between the total electron-electron\nrepulsion energy Vee of the interacting physical system and\nthe Coulomb energy. It follows that the correlation kinetic\nenergy, defined by TC=EXC\u2212 \u0001Vee\u2212J\u0002, is given by\na\u0002Permanent address: Department of Chemistry, University of Oslo, PO Box\n1033, Blindern, N-0315 Oslo, Norway.\nb\u0002Fax: 0191 384 4737.

The second term in-\nvolves the difference between the multiplicative exchange\npotential vX and the nonmultiplicative \u0001nonlocal, NL\u0002 ex-\nchange, vX\nNL\n.\nThere have been a number of attempts to develop\nexchange-correlation functionals by explicitly approximating\nW\u0001 and evaluating the energy using Eq. \u00012\u0002. Examples in-\nclude the half-and-half functional of Becke13 \u0003the precursor\nof the Becke-3-Lee-Yang-Parr functional14\u201317 \u0001B3LYP\u0002\u0004; the\n\u00031\/1\u0004-Pad\u00e9-based form of Ernzerhof;18 the two-legged repre-\nsentation of Burke et al.;19 and the interaction strength inter-\npolation of Seidl et al.20 Mori-S\u00e1nchez, Cohen, and Yang21\n\u0001MCY\u0002 recently proposed two functionals based on the same\nform considered by Ernzerhof,18\nW\u0001\nMCY\n= a +\nb\u0001\n1 + c\u0001\n, \u00019\u0002\nbut with alternative definitions of the three parameters.\nThe quantities a and b in Eq. \u00019\u0002 define the value and\nslope, respectively, of W\u0001\nMCY at \u0001=0. To satisfy Eq. \u00015\u0002,\nMori-S\u00e1nchez et al. defined the parameter a to be the ex-\nchange energy EX. In order to avoid the computational ex-\npense of the GL2 slope evaluation, they defined b as a modi-\nfied Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria22 \u0001TPSS\u0002 slope, with\nan additional scaling factor of 4.0 to optimize thermochemi-\ncal performance. The parameter c was chosen such that\nW\u0001\nMCY equalled the BLYP \u0001Ref. 16 and 23\u0002 value at \u0001=0.63,\nagain to optimize performance. This functional was denoted\nas MCY1. A second functional \u0001denoted as MCY2\u0002 involving\nan additional scaling factor was introduced to improve\natomic energies. A key feature of the MCY functionals is that\nthey are one-electron self-interaction-free, meaning that the\nexchange-correlation energy exactly cancels the Coulomb\nenergy for any one-electron density; this follows because, as\ndefined, b=0 for a one-electron system and so the exchange-\ncorrelation energy reduces to the exchange energy, as re-\nquired. They are not, however, many electron\nself-interaction-free.24,25 The performance of the functionals\nis encouraging, notably providing a simultaneously good de-\nscription of thermochemistry and kinetics.21\nThe quality of the MCY functionals is governed by the\nmathematical form of Eq. \u00019\u0002 and the procedure used to de-\ntermine the three parameters. An obvious \u0001but necessary\u0002 de-\nficiency is that although the leading parameter was deter-\nmined so as to reproduce a known property of the exact AC,\nthe other two were not. The first aim of the present study is\nto use correlated ab initio calculations to investigate the per-\nformance of the W\u0001 form in Eq. \u00019\u0002 when all three param-\neters are determined so as to reproduce accurate properties of\nthe AC\u2014this will establish how well the exact AC can be\nrepresented using this form. As the test, we shall consider the\nsinglet ground state potential energy curve of the H2 mol-\necule, which is the famous and challenging example of static\nelectron correlation. The small size of this system allows\nessentially exact ab initio calculations to be performed and\nthe two-electron nature affords several welcome simplifica-\ntions. The work is particularly relevant in light of the recent\nstudy by Fuchs et al.,26 who considered H2 dissociation us-\ning the random phase approximation \u0001RPA\u0002;3,5 see Ref. 26\nfor a detailed discussion of H2 dissociation in DFT. The sec-\nond aim of the study is to extend the analysis to other AC\nforms, paying attention to size extensivity and the behavior\nin the strong-interaction limit.\nWe commence in Sec. II by describing how large basis\nset full configuration interaction \u0001FCI\u0002 calculations can be\nused to determine accurate properties of the AC. In Sec. III,\nthe three parameters in the AC form in Eq. \u00019\u0002 are deter-\nmined so as to reproduce these FCI values exactly, yielding\nan exchange-correlation energy expressed entirely in terms\nof FCI-derived quantities. This is then combined with other\nFCI-derived energy components to give the total electronic\nenergy. The H2 potential energy curve and related properties\ndetermined in this manner are compared with conventional\nDFT results and FCI reference values, allowing the accuracy\nof the AC form to be quantified. The analysis is extended to\nother AC forms in Sec. IV. Conclusions are presented in Sec.\nV.\nII. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\nAll calculations in this study use the CADPAC program,27\nwith the extensive aug-cc-pV6Z orbital basis set,28 omitting\ng and h functions for technical reasons.

The FCI calculations provide exact re-\nsults within the extensive basis set; the dissociation energy\nagrees with that of Ko\u0142os and Wolniewicz29 to within 0.1%.\nOur first task is to calculate accurate properties of the\nAC. In principle, an accurate AC curve can be determined by\nevaluating Eq. \u00013\u0002 using wave functions from FCI calcula-\ntions, and although this is nontrivial for arbitrary \u0001, it is\nstraightforward when \u0001 is 0 or 1. For \u0001=0, evaluation of Eq.\n\u00015\u0002 using FCI data gives the exchange energy, determined\nusing the Kohn-Sham orbitals associated with the FCI den-\nsity. For a two-electron system, the exchange energy is mi-\nnus one-half of the Coulomb energy, and so\nW0\nFCI\n= \u2212\n1\n2\nJFCI, \u000110\u0002\nwhere JFCI is the Coulomb energy in Eq. \u00014\u0002, evaluated using\nthe FCI density. For \u0001=1, evaluation of Eq. \u00016\u0002 using the FCI\ndata gives\nW1\nFCI\n= Vee\nFCI\n\u2212 JFCI, \u000111\u0002\nwhere Vee\nFCI is the FCI electron-electron repulsion energy, ob-\ntained by subtracting the nuclear-nuclear repulsion and one-\nelectron energies \u0001determined using the FCI density matrix\u0002\nfrom the FCI total electronic energy. Eqs. \u000110\u0002 and \u000111\u0002 rep-\nresent exact values of the AC, within the basis set, which can\neasily be determined from a FCI calculation.\nThe slope at \u0001=0 is twice the GL2 energy, given in Eq.\n\u00018\u0002, evaluated using the Kohn-Sham orbitals and eigenvalues\nassociated with the FCI density. For this two-electron sys-\ntem, vX in the second term of Eq. \u00018\u0002 is minus one-half of the\nCoulomb potential, since the potential is the functional de-\nrivative of the corresponding energy. Given that there is only\none occupied orbital \b1, it follows that\n\u0007\b1\bvX\b\b\u0005\t = \u0007\b1\bvX\nNL\b\b\u0005\t , \u000112\u0002\nfor all virtual orbitals \b\u0005. Hence the latter term in Eq. \u00018\u0002 is\nidentically zero and\n\n \u0003W\u0001FCI\n\u0003\u0001\n\n\n\u0001=0\n= \u2212\n1\n2 \u0005ij\u0005\u0006\n\u0003\u0001\u0005i\b\u0006j\u0002 \u2212 \u0001\u0005j\b\u0006i\u0002\u00042\n\u0007\u0005 + \u0007\u0006 \u2212 \u0007i \u2212 \u0007 j\n. \u000113\u0002\nEvaluation of this expression requires the Kohn-Sham orbit-\nals and eigenvalues associated with the FCI density and the\naccuracy of these quantities will depend on the method used\nto obtain them. We use the Wu-Yang30 \u0001WY\u0002 implementation\nof the constrained search formulation,31,32 which minimizes\nthe noninteracting kinetic energy subject to the constraint\nthat the FCI density is recovered. A well-balanced descrip-\ntion of the orbitals and potential is known to be\nimportant33,34 in the closely related Yang-Wu optimized ef-\nfective potential scheme35 and so we use the same \u0001trun-\ncated\u0002 aug-cc-pV6Z basis set28 for the expansion of both the\norbitals and potential. We use a Fermi-Amaldi36 reference\npotential, which provides essentially identical results to those\nobtained using a Slater reference potential.37 We use a cutoff\nof 1\t10\u22126 in the truncated singular value decomposition,\nwhich provides essentially identical results to those obtained\nusing a cutoff of 1\t10\u22128. Further reduction in the cutoff is\nnumerically undesirable. By construction, the density from\nthe Kohn-Sham occupied orbital should equal the FCI den-\nsity and so the accuracy of the calculations can be judged by\ncomparing the Coulomb energies \u0003Eq. \u00014\u0002\u0004 from the two den-\nsities. For the range of H2 internuclear separations \u0001R\u0002 con-\nsidered \u00010.7 bohr\nR\n10 bohrs\u0002, the energies from the two\ndensities differ by a maximum of 5\t10\u22126 hartree \u00017\n\t10\u22124% \u0002.\nSchipper et al.38 have demonstrated that the exchange-\ncorrelation potential that exactly corresponds to a finite\nGaussian basis set density can exhibit unphysical, oscillatory\nstructure. The exchange-correlation potentials in our WY cal-\nculations do exhibit minor undulations when R is large. In\norder to obtain a smooth, more physically sensible potential,\nwe have performed additional calculations using the proce-\ndure of Heaton-Burgess et al.,34 which introduces a smooth-\ning norm into the minimization. The potentials do become\nvery smooth but, importantly, the potential energy curves\n\u0001see later\u0002 are essentially indistinguishable from those ob-\ntained without the smoothing norm. The FCI density is less\nwell reproduced, however, because the procedure limits the\nextent to which the solution point \u0001\u0004=\u0004FCI\u0002 can be reached.\nFor a two-electron system, the exchange-correlation po-\ntential that yields the finite basis FCI density can be deter-\nmined exactly from a direct inversion of the Kohn-Sham\nequation;39 see Ref. 40 for a related study on the H2 mol-\necule. We have performed a direct inversion and\u2014consistent\nwith Schipper et al.38\u2014find that the potential is oscillatory in\nthe vicinity of the nuclei. A third way to determine orbitals\nand eigenvalues is therefore to solve the finite basis set\nKohn-Sham problem with this potential. Again, the potential\nenergy curves are virtually indistinguishable from those\nabove, although the FCI density is reproduced less well, this\ntime due to the use of a finite basis set. Throughout this\nstudy, Eq. \u000113\u0002 is therefore evaluated using the first of the\nthree described procedures.\nEvaluation of Eqs. \u000110\u0002, \u000111\u0002, and \u000113\u0002 provides accurate\nAC data for H2. In Secs. III and IV, these data will be used to\ndetermine the parameters in approximate AC forms such that\nthese FCI values, or some subset of them, are reproduced\nexactly. The associated exchange-correlation energies will\nthen be determined entirely in terms of FCI-derived quanti-\nties and so any error in the exchange-correlation energy can\nbe attributed to the failure of the approximate AC form to\nreproduce the exact AC. In practical calculations, it is more\nconvenient to deal with total electronic energies and their\nrelated properties, rather than exchange-correlation energies.\nThe nuclear-electron and Coulomb components of the total\nenergy are always explicit functionals of the density, so can\nbe calculated exactly, within the basis set, by evaluating\nthem using the FCI density. For two-electron systems, the\noccupied Kohn-Sham orbital is the square root of one-half of\nthe electron density, and so the noninteracting kinetic energy,\nwhich is generally a functional of the orbitals, also becomes\nan explicit functional of the density. Specifically, it is given\nby the von Weizs\u00e4cker expression,41\n244104-3 Modeling the adiabatic connection J. Chem. Phys. 126, 244104 \u00022007\u0001\nDownloaded 27 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

The only other component is the nuclear-nuclear\nrepulsion, which is trivial to determine. We therefore define\nour total DFT electronic energy for H2 as\nE = TW\nFCI + Ene\nFCI + JFCI + Enn + EXC, \u000115\u0002\nwhere TW\nFCI and Ene\nFCI are the von Weizs\u00e4cker and nuclear-\nelectron energies, respectively, evaluated using the FCI den-\nsity. The first four terms are exact and the error in the final\nterm arises entirely from the approximate AC form. Com-\nparison of energies from Eq. \u000115\u0002 with those from FCI will\ntherefore allow the accuracy of the AC form to be quantified.\nIII. APPLICATION TO THE W\u0001MCY FORM\nAs a first application, we consider the AC form in Eq.\n\u00019\u0002. We introduce the notation\nW\u0001\nAC1\n= a +\nb\u0001\n1 + c\u0001\n\u000116\u0002\nfor which the exchange-correlation energy in Eq. \u000115\u0002 is21\nEXC\nAC1\n= a +\nb\nc\n\u000b1 \u2212 loge\u00011 + c\u0002\nc\n\f . \u000117\u0002\nWe define the parameters a, b, and c, by requiring that the\nvalue and slope of W\u0001\nAC1 at \u0001=0, together with the value at\n\u0001=1, equal the FCI values of Sec. II,\nW0\nAC1\n= a = W0\nFCI\n, \u000118\u0002\n\n \u0003W\u0001AC1\n\u0003\u0001\n\n\n\u0001=0\n= b = \n \u0003W\u0001FCI\n\u0003\u0001\n\n\n\u0001=0\n, \u000119\u0002\nand\nW1\nAC1\n= a +\nb\n1 + c\n= W1\nFCI\n. \u000120\u0002\nFrom Eqs. \u000110\u0002, \u000111\u0002, and \u000113\u0002, it follows that\na = \u2212\n1\n2\nJFCI, \u000121\u0002\nb = \u2212\n1\n2 \u0005ij\u0005\u0006\n\u0003\u0001\u0005i\b\u0006j\u0002 \u2212 \u0001\u0005j\b\u0006i\u0002\u00042\n\u0007\u0005 + \u0007\u0006 \u2212 \u0007i \u2212 \u0007 j\n, \u000122\u0002\nusing Kohn-Sham quantities from the WY calculation, and\nc =\nb\nVee\nFCI\n\u2212 JFCI \u2212 a\n\u2212 1. \u000123\u0002\nFor each H2 internuclear separation, an FCI calculation was\nperformed and the quantities a, b, and c in Eqs. \u000121\u0002\u2013\u000123\u0002,\nwere determined. These were used to evaluate the exchange-\ncorrelation energy using Eq. \u000117\u0002, which was then combined\nwith the other FCI-derived components in Eq. \u000115\u0002, to deter-\nmine the total electronic energy. Results from this procedure\nare denoted as AC1.\nWe first consider potential energy curves of H2 deter-\nmined using standard methods, reiterating that all calcula-\ntions in this study use the appropriate spin-restricted formal-\nism. Figure 2\u0001a\u0002 compares self-consistent Hartree-Fock \u0001HF\u0002\nand B3LYP curves with the FCI reference curve. HF is very\npoor, reflecting the 50% unphysical ionic contribution\n\u0001H+\u00afH\u2212\u0002 to the wave function at dissociation. The B3LYP\ncurve is an improvement, but significant error remains. Also\nshown is the self-consistent MCY1 curve, which is similar to\nthe MCY2 curve \u0001not shown\u0002. MCY1 provides similar per-\nformance to B3LYP while removing the one-electron self-\ninteraction error.\nFigure 2\u0001b\u0002 compares the AC1 potential energy curve\nwith the FCI reference curve. It is a significant improvement\nover those of Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002. We stress that the improvement is not\nsimply a consequence of using improved Kohn-Sham orbit-\nals; we have performed MCY1 culations using the WY or-\nbitals and the shape of the potential energy curve barely\nchanges from the MCY1 curve in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002, other than by an\nupward shift due to the non variational nature of such calcu-\nlations.\nAC1 provides a good description of the potential energy\ncurve in the region of the minimum. MCY1 and B3LYP are\nalso accurate in this region, while HF is poor. To quantify the\naccuracy, Table I presents optimized bond lengths Re for the\nmethods, comparing with the FCI value, which agrees with\nexperiment to the precision quoted. All three DFT methods\ngive bond lengths to within 0.001 bohr of FCI; the bond\nFIG. 2.

The potential en-\nergy curves have also been used to determine vibrational\nenergy levels, using the LEVEL 7.5 code of Le Roy.44 The\npotential energy curves used as input consisted of points in\nthe range of 0.7 bohr\nR\n3.5 bohrs, with a spacing of\n0.01 bohr; we have confirmed that the quoted results are con-\nverged with respect to these quantities. Convergence of the\ncalculated levels was set to 1\t10\u22122 cm\u22121 and ten-point\npiecewise polynomial interpolation was used. Zero-point,\nfundamental, and overtone wave numbers \u0001J=0\u0002 are pre-\nsented in Table I, comparing with the FCI values, which\nagree with experiment to within 1 cm\u22121. AC1 provides the\nbest agreement with FCI, with errors of 5, 14, and 33 cm\u22121,\nrespectively for zero point, fundamental, and overtone; the\ncorresponding percentage errors are 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.4%.\nThe next best results are obtained with B3LYP, where the\nerrors are 6, 26, and 75 cm\u22121. MCY1 errors are 11, 35, and\n94 cm\u22121. All three functionals therefore provide a good qual-\nity zero-point wave number, but the differences between the\nmethods become more pronounced for the higher levels, with\nMCY1 and \u0001to a lesser extent\u0002 B3LYP degrading. The HF\nerrors are significantly larger.\nFigure 2\u0001b\u0002 further demonstrates that at large R, AC1\nalso provides results in excellent agreement with FCI\u2014static\ncorrelation is recovered. In fact, the dissociation limit is ob-\ntained exactly because as R\u2192\u000b, the quantity b\u2192\u2212\u000b, due to\nthe eigenvalue degeneracy in the denominator of Eq. \u000122\u0002. It\nfollows that the exchange-correlation energy in Eq. \u000117\u0002 ap-\nproaches the value W1\nAC1\n, which, by construction, equals\nW1\nFCI in Eq. \u000111\u0002. Given that there is no electron-electron\nrepulsion, this is just the negative of the FCI coulomb en-\nergy, and so the exchange-correlation energy exactly cancels\nthe Coulomb one and the total energy in Eq. \u000115\u0002 reduces to\nthe sum of the one-electron contributions, as required. This is\nalso evident from a consideration of the derivative of Eq.\n\u000116\u0002,\n\u0003W\u0001\nAC1\n\u0003\u0001\n=\nb\n\u00011 + c\u0001\u00022\n, \u000124\u0002\nas R\u2192\u000b, which exhibits the correct behavior, as described\nin Ref. 26. When \u0001=0, the gradient equals b, which is minus\ninfinity in the limit. For any nonzero \u0001, however, the gradient\nis zero due to the quadratic divergence in the denominator.\nAs R\u2192\u000b, the quantity W\u0001AC1 therefore drops from its value\nof W0\nAC1\n=a with an infinite slope, acquiring the constant\nvalue W1\nAC1\n=2a for all nonzero \u0001, thereby trivially integrat-\ning to an energy of W1\nAC1\n. It follows that TC is exactly zero\n\u0001recall Fig. 1\u0002, which is appropriate in this case as it com-\nprises two isolated one-electron systems. The reader is re-\nferred to Fig. 2 of Ref. 26 and the discussion of Fig. 3,\nbelow. It is worth noting that this lack of \u0001 dependence in\nW\u0001\nAC1 \u0001i.e., TC=0\u0002 will occur whenever b\u2192\u2212\u000b, for example,\nin the dissociation of a general homonuclear diatomic mol-\necule.

Mori-S\u00e1nchez et al.21 cite the related\nexample of the uniform electron gas.\nNext, consider intermediate regions in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002. The\nAC1 curve resembles that obtained by Fuchs et al.,26 using\nthe RPA. There is an unphysical barrier, which is the first\nsignificant discrepancy compared to FCI. We reiterate that\nthis feature is unaffected by smoothing the potential in the\nWY procedure or the use of the direct inversion alternative.\nThis does not imply, however, that it is insensitive to the\nchoice of orbitals and eigenvalues in Eq. \u000122\u0002. Replacing the\nFCI-based WY quantities with those from the\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof45 functional more than doubles the\nsize of the barrier; using Hartree-Fock quantities causes a\nfurther significant increase. See Ref. 46 for a discussion of\nthe orbital dependence of this feature in the RPA. We inter-\npret the barrier in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 as a failure of Eq. \u000116\u0002. Consis-\ntent with this, we note that Fuchs et al.26 used a similar form\nto represent their near-exact AC near equilibrium, but had to\nintroduce additional flexibility into the form at intermediate\nR.\nTable II quantifies the AC1 error in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002. Rather\nthan presenting total electronic energies, only the exchange-\ncorrelation component is presented; the error is the same.\nThe values may provide a useful reference for future studies\nof exchange-correlation in H2. The first column lists exact\nvalues determined from FCI,\nEXC\nFCI\n= EFCI \u2212 TW\nFCI\n\u2212 Ene\nFCI\n\u2212 JFCI \u2212 Enn, \u000125\u0002\nwhere EFCI is the FCI total electronic energy. The second\ncolumn lists AC1 energies and the third column lists the\nassociated percentage errors. The error at the equilibrium\ngeometry \u00011.4 bohr\u0002 is 10\u22124 hartree, which represents the\nAC1 error in the dissociation energy. The maximum discrep-\nancy occurs at 5 bohrs, where the energy difference is 1.35\n\t10\u22122 hartree \u00012.3%\u0002. This error is about one-half of that\nobtained with the RPA in the study of Fuchs et al.26\nIt is instructive to examine the shape of W\u0001\nAC1 in the\nthree cases. Figure 3 presents W\u0001\nAC1 plots at \u0001a\u0002 R=1.4 bohr,\n\u0001b\u0002 5.0 bohrs, and \u0001c\u0002 10.0 bohrs. The self-consistent MCY1\ncurves are presented for comparison. Both methods define\nW0 to equal the exchange energy, but the values are different\nin practice because the MCY1 calculations use the self-\nconsistent MCY1 exchange energy, whereas AC1 uses Eq.\n\u000121\u0002. At the equilibrium bond length \u0001R=1.4 bohr\u0002, the two\ncurves have a different shape, but the integrals, which deter-\nmine EXC through Eq. \u00012\u0002, are similar; the potential energy\ncurves are therefore similar near equilibrium. The AC1 curve\nin Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 closely resembles the \u201cexact\u201d curve of Fuchs\net al.26 As R increases \u0003Figs. 3\u0001b\u0002 and 3\u0001c\u0002\u0004, the MCY1 inte-\ngral becomes significantly less negative than that of AC1 and\nthis is again reflected in the potential energy curves. At R\n=10 bohrs, the AC1 curve is almost flat; it will become com-\npletely flat, as discussed above, as R\u2192\u000b. Interestingly, for\nthis internuclear separation the MCY1 and AC1 curves have\nvery similar values at \u0001=1 and so the failure of MCY1 can\nbe attributed almost entirely to the incorrect slope at \u0001=0.\nThe modified TPSS slope used in MCY1 does not diverge;\nthe slope actually becomes less negative with increasing R.\nThe GL2 slope used in AC1 does diverge, due to its depen-\ndence on the virtual orbital eigenvalues\u2014static correlation is\nrecovered. As with the potential energy curve, we have con-\nfirmed that the MCY1 curves in Fig. 3 do not improve when\nthey are evaluated using the WY orbitals.\nFigure 4 presents \u00032W\u0001\nAC1\/\u0003\u00012, plotted as a function of R,\nfor a range of \u0001 values. The curve for \u0001=0 is not presented\ndue to the divergence at large R. For all the \u0001 values shown,\nthe curvature is small near equilibrium, increases to a maxi-\nmum for intermediate R, then decreases again near dissocia-\ntion. The observation that the associated potential energy\ncurve is accurate at equilibrium and dissociation, but rela-\ntively poor in the intermediate regions, indicates that the\nform in Eq. \u000116\u0002 works well when the curvature is limited,\nbut less well when it is higher. Inclusion of higher order\nterms in the expansion appears desirable, but would require\nadditional input data. The high curvature of W\u0001 and the as-\nsociated failure of Eq. \u000116\u0002 at intermediate R may reflect the\nfact that the nature of the exact wave function changes very\nrapidly in this region of the potential energy curve,47 as evi-\ndenced by rapid changes in the occupation numbers of the \fg\nand \fu natural orbitals.\nIV.

We complete this study by consid-\nering polynomial AC forms, which provide size-extensive\nmodels. We continue to define W\u0001 in terms of parameters a,\nb, and c, but their definitions may differ from those in Sec.\nIII. We first consider the two forms\nW\u0001\nAC2\n= a + b\u0001 ,\n\u000126\u0002\nW\u0001\nAC3\n= a + b\u0001 + c\u00012,\nfor which the exchange-correlation energies are\nEXC\nAC2\n= a +\nb\n2\n,\n\u000127\u0002\nEXC\nAC3\n= a +\nb\n2\n+\nc\n3\n.\nFor AC2, we can require that the value and slope of W\u0001\nAC2 at\n\u0001=0 equal the FCI values of Sec.

The\npotential energy curve determined in this manner is denoted\nas AC2 in Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002. It is in poor agreement with FCI near\nequilibrium, diverging as R increases, due to the divergence\nof b. In light of the half-and-half \u0001H&H\u0002 work of Becke,13\nwho also used the AC2 linear interpolation, we can alterna-\ntively require that the values of W\u0001\nAC2 equal the FCI values at\n\u0001=0 and \u0001=1; this can be regarded as an exact representa-\ntion of the half-and-half functional. In this case, Eq. \u000129\u0002 is\nreplaced by\nW1\nAC2\n= a + b = W1\nFCI\n, \u000130\u0002\nand so from Eq. \u000111\u0002,\nb = Vee\nFCI\n\u2212 JFCI \u2212 a . \u000131\u0002\nThe curve determined in this manner is denoted as\nAC2\u0001H&H\u0002 in Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002. It is again in poor agreement with\nFCI near equilibrium but there is no divergence at large R, as\nthe GL2 energy is not used.\nAC3 contains three parameters and so, as in Sec. III, we\nrequire that the value and slope of W\u0001\nAC3 at \u0001=0, together\nwith the value at \u0001=1, equal the FCI values. It follows that a\nand b are evaluated using Eqs. \u000121\u0002 and \u000122\u0002 while c is de-\ntermined from\nW1\nAC3\n= a + b + c = W1\nFCI\n, \u000132\u0002\nand so from Eq. \u000111\u0002,\nc = Vee\nFCI\n\u2212 JFCI \u2212 a \u2212 b , \u000133\u0002\nThe potential energy curve determined in this manner is de-\nnoted as AC3 in Fig. 5\u0001c\u0002. The agreement with FCI near\nequilibrium is now much improved. The minimum energy is\nat 1.402 bohr and the zero-point, fundamental, and overtone\nvibrational wave numbers are underestimated by just 4, 9,\nand 20 cm\u22121, which are the smallest errors obtained in this\nstudy. The curve again diverges with increasing R, albeit\nmore slowly than with AC2. The inclusion of higher order\nterms in \u0001 would again appear desirable.\nThe forms in Eq. \u000126\u0002 give energies that are size exten-\nsive and one-electron self-interaction-free \u0001when b and c are\ndefined as above and a is evaluated as the exchange energy\u0002;\nhowever, they do not scale to a constant in the strong-\ninteraction \u0001\u0001\u2192\u000b\u0002 limit50 when b and c are nonzero. This\nleads us to consider the alternative forms\nFIG. 5. Potential energy curve of H2 determined using FCI, compared with\nthose from size-extensive models.

Com-\npared to the AC2, AC2\u0001H&H\u0002, and AC3 curves, the behavior\nat large R is improved; the AC5 curvature is higher than that\nof AC3, leading to an overestimation in the vibrational wave\nnumbers.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe have used FCI data to quantify the accuracy of ap-\nproximate AC forms in describing the ground state potential\nenergy curve of H2 within spin-restricted DFT, which is the\nfamous and challenging example of static electron correla-\ntion. The key idea is to calculate accurate properties of the\nAC using FCI-derived data and then determine the param-\neters in approximate AC forms so as to reproduce these val-\nues exactly. The FCI density is also used to calculate the\nnon-exchange-correlation components of the total electronic\nenergy, allowing the accuracy of the various AC forms to be\nquantified.\nInitially, we focused on the AC in Eq. \u000116\u0002, which has\nbeen considered previously by Ernzerhof18 and Mori-\nS\u00e1nchez et al.21 A particularly attractive feature of this form\nis that an appropriate choice of b can easily eliminate one-\nelectron self-interaction.21 The potential energy curve deter-\nmined using our approach is a significant improvement over\nthose from Hartree-Fock and existing DFT functionals. The\naccuracy near equilibrium has been quantified by evaluating\nthe bond length and vibrational wave numbers; errors in the\nlatter are below 0.5%. The molecule dissociates correctly,\nwhich can be traced to the use of the GL2 slope. As in\nRefs. 26, 51, and 52, the present study therefore highlights\nthe importance of virtual orbitals and eigenvalues for captur-\ning static electron correlation effects. At intermediate R, the\npotential energy curve exhibits an unphysical barrier, which\nresembles that observed in Ref. 26 using the random phase\napproximation, but the magnitude in the present study is\nabout half the size. Analysis of the curvature of the AC in-\ndicates that Eq. \u000116\u0002 works well when there is limited curva-\nture, but less well when it is higher. The high curvature and\nfailure of Eq. \u000116\u0002 at intermediate R may reflect the rapidly\nchanging nature of the exact wave function in this region of\nthe potential energy curve.\nWe have subsequently considered AC representations\nthat lead to size-extensive models. Neither a straightforward\nlinear nor quadratic polynomial can provide an accurate po-\ntential energy curve for all R, although the quadratic form is\naccurate near equilibrium. We have also considered two al-\nternative forms that can scale correctly to a constant in the\nstrong-interaction limit, which lead to improvements at large\nR.\nNotwithstanding the high computational cost, the study\ndemonstrates how data from correlated ab initio calculations\ncan provide valuable information about AC forms and high-\nlight areas where further theoretical progress is required,\nmost notably in the description of the slope in the noninter-\nacting limit.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to A.
