Introduction\nThe construction industry is concerned with the\nplanning, design, production, alteration, main-\ntenance and demolition of the built environ-\nment. In the contemporary world this industry\nis facing pressure to increase the sustainability\nof its practice \u00001\u0001. This pressure is understood\nto require significant change in the industry\u2019s\nunderstanding of the demands of society and of\nits clients, as well as change to its own sense of\ncorporate social responsibility. This in turn im-\nplies major changes in the industry\u2019s work prac-\ntices. Kibert \u00002\u0001 summarises the aims of such a\nsustainable practice in construction through the\nfollowing principles:\n1. Minimisation of resource consumption.\n2. Maximisation of resource reuse.\n3. Use of renewable and recyclable resources.\n4. Protection of the natural environment.\n5. Creation of a healthy and non-toxic environ-\nment.\n6. Pursuit of quality in creating the built envi-\nronment.\nWithin the industry\u2019s own discourse addressing\nthese issues is seen to require the adaptation\nof present practice \u0002e.g. the need to design and\nconstruct buildings in different ways, for ease\nof demolition as well as ease of construction\u0003\nand the creation and application of new knowl-\nedge within new practices \u0002e.g. the adoption\nof new sustainable ideas and concepts\u0003 \u00003\u0001 \u00004\u0001.\nBut, sustainability is still seen as a novel and\ncontestable concept within the construction in-\ndustry, with no settled definition or operational-\nisation, and thus has no settled body of existing\npractice or processes. It is as much a philosophy\nof construction as a prescribed method. In the\nface of this, the industry conceives it necessary\nto develop new understandings to lead to new\nsustainable practices and processes. It believes\nthat this might be achieved through attention to\ninnovation and through dialogue. Such inno-\nvation and dialogue often take the form of un-\ndertaking pilot sustainable construction projects\n\u0002often high profile or prestige\u0003, learning from\nthese pilots and then applying this learning to\ngeneral construction; an approach, which if\ntaken na\u0131\u00a8vely, seems to offer little prospect of\nsustained ongoing innovation. This research\n138 Knowledge about Sustainability: SSM as a Method for Conceptualising\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\nthen starts with an agenda that seeks to prob-\nlematise such dialogue and innovation in terms\nof a need for what the industry perceives as\nknowledge management.\n1.1. The C-SanD Project\nThis paper is concerned with the choice of\nmethodology to address such a situation and is\nmotivated by involvement in a joint academic-\nindustry research project focused on creating,\nsustaining and disseminating knowledge for sus-\ntainable construction across multiple stakehold-\ners involved in construction projects \u2013 the\nC-SanD project1. The project focuses on identi-\nfying and supporting emerging sustainable con-\nstruction practices both within companies and\nbetween companies engaged in construction pro-\njects \u0002including clients\u0003. The research project\naims to apply principles from constructionman-\nagement, knowledge management and informa-\ntion systems to devise a technology or interven-\ntion which may aid the industry in achieving\nsustainability goals.\nOne particular aspect of this work is the fo-\ncus of this paper, the application of a specific\nmethodology, soft systemsmethodology \u0002SSM\u0003\nin order to gain an understanding of the issues\nassociated with knowledge within the construc-\ntion industry. Our chosen stance with regard\nto knowledge management is based on a socio-\nlogical approach to knowledge, suggesting that\nknowledge is a consequence of social interac-\ntion. Consideration is given here to the features\nrequired of a methodology to develop know-\nledge management systems for the construction\nindustry. The following section discusses our\nchosen stance for knowledge management and\nknowledge creation. This is followed by discus-\nsion of the role of ICTs and information systems\ndevelopment methods in knowledge manage-\nment. The final section introduces and seeks\nto justify our choice of SSM as an appropriate\nmethodology and describes how the methodo-\nlogy is applied within the C-SanD project. The\npaper concludes with a discussion of the general\nappropriateness of SSM toKnowledgeManage-\nment interventions.\n2. Knowledge Management?\nKnowledge management is a broad and expand-\ning topic \u00005\u0001. In reviewing the theory and litera-\nture of this field, and applying it to the challenge\nof sustainable construction, it is necessary to\ncommit to an identifiable epistemic flavour of\napproach. Many such approaches have been\nidentified, and have been categorised in various\nways \u00006\u20139\u0001. Schultze \u00009\u0001 engages Burrell and\nMorgan\u2019s \u000010\u0001 framework in order to identify\na two fold typology of knowledge within the\ndebate: objectivist and subjectivist. An objec-\ntivist approach views knowledge as an object to\nbe discovered \u000011\u0001. Identifying the existence of\nknowledge in various forms and locations, tech-\nnology is then employed in the codification of\nsuch knowledge objects \u000012\u0001. In contrast, a sub-\njectivist approach suggests that knowledge is\ninherently identified and linked to human ex-\nperience and the social practice of knowing,\nas seen, for example, in the work of Tenkasi\nand Boland \u000013\u0001 and Brown and Duguid \u000014\u0001.\nIn adopting such a stance, it is contended that\nknowledge is continuously shaped by the social\npractice of communities and institutions and far\nless amenable to codification.\nSuch an objectivist versus subjectivist account,\nif taken too literally, may indeed be too bi-\nnary. We thus recognise a third, constructivist\napproach, suggesting that a position of either\nabsolute subjectivity or absolute objectivity is\nuntenable; rather, these become relative posi-\ntions in the intersubjective social consciousness\n\u000015\u0001 \u000016\u0001. Subjectivity and objectivity are inter-\nlocked in a reciprocal relationship and both are\nalways necessary \u000015\u0001. In adopting such a po-\nsition to knowledge, it is accepted that society\n\u0002and thus knowledge processes within it\u0003 are\nboth a subjective and objective reality. Social\nreality is to be understood in terms of an on-\ngoing dialectical process composed of an indi-\nvidual simultaneously externalising their being\ninto the social world, and internalising the so-\ncial world as objective reality; \u201cto be in society\nis to participate in this dialectic\u201d\u000016\u0001. Taking\nsuch a broad approach, Demarest \u00021997\u0003 argues\n1The C-SanD project: Creating, Sustaining and Disseminating Knowledge for Sustainable Construction is supported by the\nUK EPSRC. The project includes staff from Loughborough University, LSE and University of Salford. Further details available at\nwww.c-sand.org.uk.\nKnowledge about Sustainability: SSM as a Method for Conceptualising\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 139\nthat knowledge is embedded within the organi-\nsation, not just through individual actors or ex-\nplicit programmes, but also through social inter-\nchange. This, however, may still tend to suggest\nthat knowledge is an object that can be embed-\nded and distributed, rather than as a change in\nthe perceptions of individual actors who can\ninstitute practices that embody and perpetuate\ntheir increased understanding. For us it is these\nnew practices that are disseminated, and other\nactors encountering these new practices may\nlearn from them and develop their knowledge.\nHaving identified this third constructivist ap-\nproach, the rest of this section explores this di-\nalectic of knowledge, and, in particular, how a\nmethodology may be employed to build such a\npicture of such a reality. Thus, in contrast to ap-\nproaches which \u201cmap-knowledge\u201d \u000017, 18\u0001, our\napproach to analysis aims to explore the social\nand individual activities and the interchange in\nthe social setting, which constantly re-creates\nknowledge in new forms.\n2.1. Knowledge Creation?\nAs identified in the introduction, sustainability\nis seen within the construction industry to re-\nquire the creation and dissemination of new un-\nderstanding and knowledge. In line with the\nposition outlined above, such creation of new\nknowledge is not simply a codification effort\n\u000019\u0001, nor one driven only by personal explo-\nrations, but it involves the ability to interact with\nand convince others. The construction com-\nmunity within which such knowledge might be\nshared and communicated thus forms an impor-\ntant component of the knowledge process we\nstudy.\nAdopting such a perspective, our interest shifts\nfrom supporting, mapping, storing and dissem-\ninating knowledge as object, to supporting \u0002and\ncreating or shaping\u0003 many possible activities\nundertaken by individuals engaged in social ac-\ntion. We can still, however, argue that human\nknowledge is capable of some degree of ob-\njectification; that is, manifested as products of\nhuman activity, available to producer and others\nas elements of their intersubjective world. But,\nwe suggest that such objects do not \u201cpossess\u201d\nknowledge, as would be argued by codification\nof tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge \u000019\u0001,\nnor does technology simply act as a conduit by\nwhich knowledge may the shared. Rather, such\nelements may contain, express and inscribe ac-\ncumulations of meaning and experience \u000016\u0001.\nAn act of objectivation, for example an answer\nto a request for information on a company in-\ntranet, may make an individual\u2019s subjectivity\nappear to have greater reality, not only for the\nreceiver, but also for the producer \u000016\u0001. Equally,\nan architect\u2019s production of design documents\nacts as both communication \u0002to demonstrate the\ndesign to a client\u0003 and as individual subjective\ntool \u2013 the architect is not simply codifying a\npre-conceived picture but making real a subjec-\ntive thought \u0000see 20 for further discussion\u0001. In\nWeick\u2019s \u000021\u0001 terms, the individual makes sense\nof their world by interacting within it.\n2.2. Knowledge Only Makes Sense in\nContext\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\nSuch a sociology of knowledge suggests that\nknowledge \u0002and knowledge practices\u0003may only\nbe made sense of fully within the situation that\nit was generated and by the actors involved\nin its creation. And, yet, the aim of know-\nledge management is to enable the relocation\nof knowledge. Any abstraction of knowledge\nfrom that context removes it \u0002to some degree\u0003\nfrom the chain of because-ofs and in-order-tos\nthat brought an insight to the focal awareness\nof the individuals concerned \u000022\u0001: knowledge\nbeing what made action appropriate in that sit-\nuation at that time \u2013 what emerges as the obvi-\nous next step \u000023\u0001. Shared experience is what\nmakes an informed actor able to infer some of\nthe surrounding context on hearing or reading\nan account of the insight and relate it \u0002appro-\npriately\u0003 to his\u0004her own practice. This maybe\nthrough a local \u0002or virtual\u0003 community of prac-\ntice \u000024\u0001, where much of the context is visible;\nit maybe through a shared professional training\nand practice; or it maybe through an organisa-\ntional affiliation, where ways of doing things\nare shared.\nWe can take this a stage further to look at the\ncommunicative competencies that are involved\nin language games embedded in forms-of-life\n\u000025\u0001. The form-of-life of the construction pro-\nfessional givesmeanings to fragments of speech\nor writing that are impenetrable to outsiders for\n140 Knowledge about Sustainability: SSM as a Method for Conceptualising\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\nreasons that go beyond a lack of understanding\nof technical terminology. It is the apprentice-\nship and induction process of becoming a ser-\nvices engineer or an architect that enables an\nincreasing ability to translate communications\ninto appropriated knowledge, rather than a re-\nceived instruction. Being a services engineer or\nan architect means not just having a qualifica-\ntion, but more it means being a respected mem-\nber of a community where judgements are re-\ngarded as knowledgeable by others. In this way\nDreyfus \u000026\u0001 describes the process of develop-\ning mastery and practical wisdom in a field and\nthe possibilities and limitations of ICTs in en-\nabling such a knowledge process, while Prusak\nand Cohen \u000027\u0001 explore this at an organisational\nlevel, describing the ability to share understand-\nings as the social capital of a firm.\nThus, a key problematic of this current re-\nsearch is the investigation of how individuals\nand groups within the construction industry can\nbe assisted to make knowledgeable interpreta-\ntions for sustainabilitywithin company and pro-\nfessional structures and, crucially, in an indus-\ntry based on multi-firm and multi-professional\nprojects, across these boundaries. The later sec-\ntion of this paper on the application of soft sys-\ntems methodology describes our approach to\nthis issue. However, given the contested con-\ncept and evident challenge of sustainability to\nthe status quo, such structures of institution-\nalised practice may lead an individual to ha-\nbitualisation of action, where a given approach\nis embedded in routine \u000016\u0001. Such institution-\nalised practice is reciprocated by others in the\nsocial structure as products of history \u000016, 28,\n29\u0001; to the individuals concerned, they appear\nas objective reality. Within the construction in-\ndustry we see that professional engineers and\nmanagers often remain with the same organisa-\ntion for extended periods and their professional\nidentity often lasts throughout their career, ac-\nquiring the approaches and adopted practices of\ntheir profession and their firm, creating a set of\ndispositions for how they encounter the world,\nin Bourdieu\u2019s \u000030\u0001 framework a habitus.\nA concern for sustainability needs to success-\nfully challenge such institutionalised sets of dis-\npositions governing practice. If ICT-based sys-\ntems are to be a part of this, then they must be\nbuilt on an understanding of individuals\u2019 actions\nand habitualised practices, rather than on the\nespoused theories which may attempt to ratio-\nnalise such habitualisation through theory \u000031\u0001.\nThis study focuses upon practice across an in-\ndustrial sector, rather than intra-organisationally,\nso comparisons between practices will be re-\nquired. A methodology is thus required which\ncan capture and challenge such habitualised\npractice, and explore the social structureswithin\nwhich the activity occurs. We have thus sought\na methodology that allows us to focus upon the\nshared social context of the parties involved in\nknowledge processes and which can serve our\nattempt to develop a picture of the creation and\nuse of artefacts, and identify the knowledge\nperceived to be contained within them. The\nselected sociology of knowledge approach sug-\ngests that knowledge is only fully applicable\nwithin the context in which it was created by\nthe creators of the knowledge. However, we\nare working against such an assertion by at-\ntempting to move knowledge through ICT. The\npaper further identifies that habitualised struc-\ntures and routines limit the ability to challenge\nexisting practice. On this basis, ICT for know-\nledgemanagement presents difficult challenges.\nThe next section explores such challenges in the\ncontext of the C-SanD project\u2019s attempt to de-\nvelop a technology to challenge existing prac-\ntices within the UK construction industry in or-\nder to promote sustainability practice.\n3. Knowledge and ICTs\nThis discussion of knowledge and sustainability\nprovides a distinctive context for a considera-\ntion of the role of ICT in providing enabling re-\nsources to such environments. While many au-\nthors argue that improvement in the way know-\nledge is created and applied cannot be sought\nthrough technology alone \u000032\u201334\u0001, technologi-\ncal development and innovation clearly remain\ncentral to the research agenda of the topic. Fur-\nthermore, some parts of the construction indus-\ntry already employ ICTs extensively for infor-\nmation work. ISDN networking, CAD, project\nmanagement applications and office tools are\nstandard. Large firms in the construction sector\nhave invested heavily in intranets as a key infor-\nmational resource, though we also must recog-\nnise that most of this industry is composed of\nKnowledge about Sustainability: SSM as a Method for Conceptualising\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 141\nsmall specialist firms, and their technology plat-\nforms may be at best modest. We therefore have\nto ask what role ICTs have in supporting know-\nledge work \u00007, 35\u0001, and in the creation, dissemi-\nnation and application of knowledge within and\nbetween organisations? This simple question\nremains a contentious issue \u00005, 36, 37\u0001. Initial\napproaches to employing ICTwithin knowledge\nmanagement attempted to marry the capabili-\nties of technology with the generic features of\nknowledge management, for example consid-\nering the Internet as a knowledge repository or\ndata mining as knowledge discovery \u000033\u0001. How-\never, such approaches imply conformity among\nactivities and essentially the objectivist episte-\nmology. Other approaches have attempted to\n\u201cmap\u201d the knowledge existent within an or-\nganisation, devising pictures of communication\nwhich may be translated \u0002in whole or in part\u0003\ninto ICT solutions \u000018\u0001. But, as Hendricks notes\n\u201c\u0000 \u0000 \u0000no ICT \u0002information and communica-\ntion technology\u0003 application deserves the\nlabel of a knowledge management tool\npurely because of its own characteristics.\nIt is essential when valuing ICT applica-\ntions as knowledge management tools to\nconsider the situation in which they are\nused\u201d \u000038\u0001.\nFurther criticismof ICT-driven knowledgeman-\nagement approaches preface the objectivist ap-\nproach to knowledge while ignoring the subjec-\ntivist dimension \u000038\u201340\u0001. In contrast to such ap-\nproaches, we argue that for the development of\neffective knowledge management systems there\nis a need to build an understanding of the know-\nledge environment and context\n\u201cKnowledge is analysed as an active pro-\ncess that ismediated, situated, provisional,\npragmatic and contested. The approach\nsuggests that attention should be focused\non the systems through which people\nachieve their knowledge and on the pro-\ncesses throughwhich newknowledgemay\nbe generated.\u201d \u000040\u0001\nResponding to Blackler\u2019s call, we conceptualise\nsuch systems not as instrumental artefacts, but\nas purposeful human activity systems. Rather\nthan focusing on ICTs as driven by concern for\nwhat people know \u0002or want to know\u0003, which\nin any case proves elusive to describe \u000019\u0001,\nwe adopt an approach which focuses on what\npeople do and how others interpret this \u000041\u0001.\nThus, we can accept a potentially important\nrole for ICT in knowledge management activity,\nwhich leads us to explore the relevance of infor-\nmation systems methodologies to aid the task\nof understanding the knowledge environment,\nas guides to the establishment of relevant inno-\nvations\u0004interventions of a technological char-\nacter. Our interest in the application of infor-\nmation systems development methods to know-\nledge systems is still, however, based on the be-\nlief that, while the claims of knowledgemanage-\nment systems may be the creation, dissemina-\ntion and application of knowledge, a computer-\nbased system is only capable of processing data\n\u000042\u0001. Exploring techniques seen as effective\nin developing data processing machines which\nsupport information systems is understood as\nrelevant, but not the whole answer. We are\nthus mindful of McDermott\u2019s \u000034\u0001 comment that\n\u201cthe great trap in knowledge management is\nusing information management tools and con-\ncepts to design knowledge management sys-\ntems,\u201d as such systems often ignore the cultural\nissues and become little more than \u0002or even less\nthan\u0003 information systems.\nIn summary, the paper thus identifies a need for\na methodology which can problematise existing\npractices \u0002sustainable or otherwise\u0003 of the UK\nconstruction industry in order to develop new\nICT toolswhich effectively support the develop-\nment and dissemination of sustainability prac-\ntice. Such a methodology should be relevant to\nthe adopted social constructivist stance towards\nknowledge and it should seek to explore the\nsocial and individual activities and interchange\nconjunct with the social setting in which they\nare practiced.\nSuch a methodology should enable the identifi-\ncation of elements which may contain, express\nor inscribe meaning \u0002accepting that knowledge\nonly makes sense fully within the situation in\nwhich it was generated and by the actors in-\nvolved in its generation\u0003. In this research we\nidentify Soft SystemsMethodology as amethod-\nology capable of such application. The fol-\nlowing section introduces this methodology, de-\nscribes its relevance to this research and outlines\nhow it was used.\n142 Knowledge about Sustainability: SSM as a Method for Conceptualising\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\n4. Soft Systems Methodology\nThe discussion so far suggests a need to ex-\nplicitly recognise and incorporate technical, or-\nganisational and social modalities within any\napproach to designing and introducing know-\nledge management technologies. This implies,\namongother things, that a selectedmethodology\nneeds to be able to retain and combine such as-\npects. On this basis, our selected methodology\nis soft systems methodology \u0002SSM\u0003 \u000043, 44\u0001.\nSoft systems methodology is founded on the\nanalysis of a hierarchy of models \u0002systems\u0003 of\npurposeful activity. By employing systems con-\ncepts in the exploration of organisational know-\nledge behaviour, this work also contributes to\nthe debate begun by Galliers who suggested that\nsystems thinking be introduced within trans-\ndisciplinary research into organisational theory\n\u000045\u0001.\nThe complexity and unbounded nature of the\nsustainability issue, the implied need to do some-\nthing new, faced by the construction industry,\nleads this research to see beyond supporting\nknowledge processes within the status quo. In-\nstead, our research aims to explore and sup-\nport emergent, innovatory sustainable practice.\nSSM considers social reality as continuously\nsocially constructed and reconstructed by indi-\nviduals and groups, and is thus in keeping with\nour stance. Within the SSM, systemic think-\ning is employed as a method of making sense\nof this world. The systems outlined through\nthe method \u0002known as relevant human activity\nsystems\u0003 provide a lens through which to make\nsense of this complex and changing world, not\nrepresentations of systems existing in or pro-\nposed for the world. By applying such sys-\ntemic thinking to the issue of sustainability we\ncan apprehend the evident confusion and doubt.\nWe can elicit models of how individuals within\nthe industry conceptualise and approach sus-\ntainability concepts and sustainability problems\nand possibly offer innovations in support of this.\n4.1. Expressing the Problem Situation\nIn the SSM, so-called rich-pictures are drawn\nas a method of capturing the problem situa-\ntion, while recognising that different parties in-\nvolved in the construction conceptualise their\nwork \u0002including issues of sustainability\u0003 differ-\nently \u000044\u0001. For instance: to a client, sustainabil-\nity may consist of a public-relations exercise; to\nan architect, it may be a method of achieving\ncompetitive advantage by differentiation; for\nan engineer, meeting the requirements of the\nbuilding regulations; for a contractor, it may\nbe a tiresome interference in \u201cgetting the job\ndone\u201d. Since rich pictures \u201care a better means\nfor recording relationships and connections than\nis linear prose\u201d\u000043\u0001, they provided this project\nwith a tool to effectively express such problem\nsituations. Initial interviews and meetings were\nthus undertaken with around 17 key individuals\nacross 10 different UK construction firms and\nfrom these, research officers drew around 16\ndifferent rich pictures to represent the sustain-\nability domain identified \u0002see Figure 1 for an\nexample of one of these rich pictures\u0003.\nFrom these rich pictures the researchers then\nattempted to highlight different world-views\n\u0002Weltanschauungen\u0003 held by various parties.\nThe pictures also attempted to express the de-\ngree of social interaction and began to draw\nout the activity which was considered purpose-\nful from among the uncertainty, disagreement\nand conflict associated with the sustainability\nissue. Existing information systems were also\nincluded within these pictures, in as far as they\nare involved in such conceptualised purposeful\nactivity.\n4.2. Identifying Human Activity Systems\nThrough this field research and through the\ndrawing of such pictures for the differentWeltan-\nschauungen, a dialogue and debate were initi-\nated with industry participants to support the\nmodelling of \u201chuman activity systems\u201d which\nwere perceived as relevant to a sustainable con-\nstruction practice, by some or all of the parties\ninvolved. This debate was undertaken through\na series of workshops with key academic and\nindustry partners. An oval mapping technique\n\u000046\u0001 was used to aid the identification of such\nhuman activity systems from across the various\nrich pictures \u0002see Figure 2 for an example of\nthese oval maps\u0003.\nKnowledge about Sustainability: SSM as a Method for Conceptualising\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 143\nFig. 1. Example of a rich picture from the C-SanD project relating to the issue of sustainability regarding\nconstruction consultancy and quantity surveying.\n144 Knowledge about Sustainability: SSM as a Method for Conceptualising\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\nFig. 2. Photograph of Oval Mapping used to discuss the\nrich pictures.\nRelevant human activity systems were then ex-\npressed as root definitions which \u201cexpress the\ncore or essence of the perception to be mod-\nelled\u201d \u000043\u0001 \u2013 the core purpose of the human\nactivity system.\nThese were presented to the industry partners\nin diagrammatic form \u0002as introduced by Peter\nCheckland \u000044\u0001\u0003, such that industry participants\nmight discuss them without specific knowledge\nof SSM. An example of such root definitions is\nshown in Figure 3. Having identified such mo-\ndels of human activity systems, a second round\nof interviews was undertaken to explore their\nrelevance to individual work practices.\nThe identified human activity systems began\nto raise and identify institutionalised practices,\nand enabled an exploration of the social struc-\ntures in which the activity occurs, for instance\nidentifying the role of \u201cchartered surveyor\u201d or\nof some \u201ccommunity of practice\u201d in a design\noffice. The rich pictures encouraged a holistic\nrather than reductionist approach to apprehend-\ning the social context of the organisation, an\napproach to thinking, necessary for our adopted\nstance on knowledge management \u000047\u0001. This\nconsideration of the social and institutional struc-\nture, roles and opinions, separately from more\nformalised structures such as organisations or\nprojects, was of further value, given the dis-\ntributed nature of the construction industry.\nThrough developing such an understanding we\nwere able to propose and develop prototype\nICTs as part of human activity systems that aim\nto improve sustainable practice.\nTo this end, SSM was employed in devising\ntechnological systems which ostensibly only\nprocess data, but with a clear ambition of im-\nproving\u0004 supporting\u0004moving\u0004 sharing know-\nledge practices within this community. Since\nsustainable construction practice is constantly\nemerging, such interventions needed to be con-\nceived in a flexible and emergent manner. The\nFig. 3. Example of root definitions relating to contractors not being aware of designers\u2019 intentions.\nKnowledge about Sustainability: SSM as a Method for Conceptualising\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 145\nFig. 4. Example Conceptual Model expressed as a root definition.\nSSM, as an action research methodology, em-\nbodies such flexibility, allowing an iterative ap-\nproach to development. Through various cycles\nof iterative intervention, models of purposeful\nactivity were developed and adapted to chang-\ning knowledge practice. In this, SSM directed\nus towards achieving the change which was\nnot just systemically desirable \u0002change that im-\nproves performance against certain agreed pa-\nrameters\u0003, but also to identify change which\nmight be culturally feasible \u0002change is mean-\ningful and commands assent within the sense-\nmaking environment\u0003 \u0002Checkland \u000044\u0001\u0003. At-\ntention paid to these twin concerns made SSM\nparticularly appropriate for exploring and con-\ntextualising this problem domain as we sought\nto identify potential technical interventions.\n4.3. Moving from Soft Systems\nMethodology to IT Systems\nDevelopment\nThrough such SSM analysis we could identify\nboth responsible actors and transformations for\nwhich they were \u0002potentially\u0003 responsible. But,\nin order to build or establish new ICT-based sys-\ntems, we still needed to translate these contex-\ntually rich understandings into the sparse lan-\nguage of modelling tools and the even sparser\nlanguage of programming. How to achieve\nthese transformations so as to build the tools that\nare appropriate to at least partially described hu-\nman activity systems, was the next task of this\nresearch. For this purpose we employed UML\n\u0002unified modelling language\u0003 \u000048, 49\u0001 as a sys-\ntems design and development method, and we\nfocused on the use of our SSM descriptions of\na knowledge environment as a basis for begin-\nning a UML description of a potential technol-\nogy. In line with an incremental and iterative\napproach to system building \u000050\u0001, these descrip-\ntions were then developed into a product which\ncould be tested through further action research\ncycles. Our first step along this process was the\nconstruction of a conceptual model expressed\nin UML form \u0002as a Use Case diagram\u0003. An\nexample of this is shown in Figure 4.\n146 Knowledge about Sustainability: SSM as a Method for Conceptualising\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\n5. Conclusions\nThe research reported here focuses on how\nknowledge processes and environments can be\nunderstood and modelled as the construction\nindustry addresses the issue of sustainability.\nThis unbounded, complex and emergent domain\nis seen as requiring some technological inter-\nvention. We address such intervention through\na consideration of both established and poten-\ntially new practices. Through our epistemologi-\ncal stance on knowledge management \u0002a sociol-\nogy of knowledge\u0003 we identify a need to engage\nwith the social environment and the interaction\nthat people are engaged upon. Leaving behind\nnotions of identifying knowledge per se, we in-\nstead focus on the task of understanding \u201cwhat\npeople do\u201d or might do, and the complex envi-\nronment in which they operate, and we identify\nSSM as an appropriate methodology to aid this\ntask.\nOur research is concerned with supporting the\ndevelopment and introduction of an ICT system\ninto the practice of the UK construction indus-\ntry, yet aware of the fact that the issue within\nwhich we aim to intervene is contested, emer-\ngent and changing. Thus our use of SSM as\nan approach to develop tools to support existent\nand new knowledge practices, is a learning and\naction research approach.\nThis final section of the paper critically reviews\nthe benefits of SSM \u0002as a learning and action\nresearch approach\u0003 within this research and ex-\ntrapolates this research\u2019s experience to present\na general set of points regarding the use of SSM\nwithin knowledge management.\nSSM presents an approach focused on the on-\ngoing practice of individuals and the Weltan-\nschauungen by which such practice is deemed\nsensible. The approach thus identifies social\nstructures neither from the espoused views of\nindividuals, nor from the legitimized view of\norganisational hierarchy, but rather from ex-\nploring the social interactions inherent to the\ndoing of work. The methodology thus avoids a\ndeterministic identification of social structures,\nfor example where Communities of Practice are\nidentified simply because \u201ccommunity\u201d is a de-\nceptive and warmly persuasive word \u000051\u0001 to use\nin describing poorly understood social struc-\ntures\u000052\u0001. Furthermore, such a focus on practice\nenables the research to focus on the actions and\nactivities of individuals rather than on their es-\npoused views of knowledge needs and expecta-\ntions of what a knowledge management system\nmight do.\nSSM is thus a process of enquiry \u000053\u0001 involv-\ning participants in reflexively discussing their\nworking practices. Such discussion and de-\nbate helps focus the development of technology\non the practice of the UK construction indus-\ntry rather than on the basis of how technology\nmight be generically used in Knowledge Man-\nagement. It avoids focusing on what people\nwant, rather focusing on what people do.\nFinally, the cyclical nature of SSM and its action\nresearch approach aligns well with iterative and\nincremental software development processes. It\nthus allows the technology to be introduced into\nthe practice and the changes in this practice to\nbe observed. This further allows a focus on\nhow the industry is able to innovate new sus-\ntainable practices and then to further shape the\ntechnology to better reflect such new practice.\n6.
