Hudson@Durham.ac.uk \n \n \nIntroduction  \n \nFollowing its election in 1997, the \u2018New Labour\u2019 government in the United \nKingdom promoted the concept of regional devolution, leading to the creation \nof unelected Regional Assemblies in the English Regions. In 2002 the \nGovernment White Paper Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the English \nRegions brought the prospect of elected Regional Assemblies to those \nEnglish Regions that wanted them (see ODPM, 2004a). As in many other \ninstances over the last sixty years, north-east England was intended to be the \nlaboratory in which this experiment in a new form of regional policy was to be \nfirst conducted.  However, early in November 2004 the residents of the region \ndecisively ejected \u2013 by a majority of 4 to 1 \u2013 proposals for an elected Regional \nAssembly. This event and the debate leading up to it provided the context and \nstimulus for this paper. The proposition that regional devolution in and of itself \nwill lead to economic success has become deeply embedded in beliefs and \npolicy discourses about the determinants of regional prosperity and in turn \nhas lead to political demands for such devolution. In this paper I seek critically \nto examine such claims. \n \nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. First, there are a few \nintroductory comments on concepts of power, regions, the reorganisation of \nthe state and of multi-level governance, and governmentality, which can be \nused to help understand the issues surrounding regional devolution. Then I \nexamine the ways in which north-east England was politically and socially \nconstructed as a particular type of region, with specific problems, in the 1930s \n\u2013 a move that had lasting significance to the present day. Moving on some six \ndecades, I then examine contemporary claims about the relationship between \nregional devolution and regional economic success, which find fertile ground \n                                                 \n1 This is a revised version of a paper first prepared for the 30th Anniversary Conference of the \nEstablishment of the Geography Institute, Roskilde University, \u201cGeographies of Power, the \nPower of Geography\u201d, Roskilde, October 26, 2004.

The \nusual disclaimers apply.  \nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nin the north-east precisely because of its long history of representation as a \nregion with a unified regional interest.  I then reflect on the processes of \nregional planning, regional strategies and regional devolution and their \nrelationship to regional economic regeneration. A brief conclusion follows.  \n \n \nConceptual groundings  \n \nConcepts of power  \n \nDrawing on the work of Allen (1997, 2003, 2004), three concepts of power can \nbe identified. These varying conceptions stress different aspects of power and \nthe processes through which it is constituted and produced. Although Allen \nregards each of them as inadequate in some way, they nonetheless provide \nconceptual tools through which issues of regional devolution and devolution of \npower to regions can be interpreted.  \n \nThe first conception, drawing on critical realism, is a \u2018centred\u2019 one of power as \nan inscribed capacity of individuals or institutions, which possess power by \nvirtue of their constitutive social relationships. It is located: that is, centred in \nagencies (individuals or organisations) as a consequence of the structure of \nthese relationships.  As a result, these varied agencies acquire specific \ncapacities that allow them to seek to secure desired outcomes. For example, \nthe state can been seen as possessing power as a consequence of its \nrelationship to capital and the requirement that it has a degree of relative \nautonomy from other social agents and classes. However, possession is not \nsynonymous with the exercise of power. The capacity to exercise power and \ndominate - that is, control, command or direct the actions of others - is only \nrealised contingently, under specific circumstances and conditions. Thus the \nability to maintain power relations is inherently problematic, precisely because \ncontexts and places are multiple and varied.  \n \nEquating power with domination emphasises the asymmetries among those \ninvolved in power relations. Those exercising power can exert \u2018power over\u2019 \nthose subject to the exercise of that power. As a result, outcomes are \ninherently unequal, with \u2018winners\u2019 gaining at the expense of \u2018losers\u2019. In this \nsense, this conception tends to conceive power relationships as zero-sum \ngames, with only a fixed amount of power (and resources) in play. Whether \nthe assumption of a fixed \u2018lump of power\u2019 is a necessary one in accounts \ninformed by critical realism remains a moot point, however.  \n \nThe second conception of power is a \u2018networked\u2019 conception. Power is \nconceived as a resource for achieving diverse ends, emphasising \u2018power to\u2019 \nand the ways in which power is generated to achieve desired outcomes rather \nthan how power constrains action. Power is not inherent in social relationships \nbut, in contrast, is produced via mobilising resources to achieve particular \ngoals. In this view, for example, the state develops power to act via the \nrelationships and alliances that it forges with other social actors or \nstakeholders. This networked conception, with networks criss-crossing and \noverlapping, also raises the possibility that power is a fluid medium, variable \n 2\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nin amount depending on context rather than a fixed quantity. It suggests that \nthe power of those enrolled in a network can be increased via their \nparticipation in it relative to non-participants, at least for as long as they \nremain members of the network. Whether all participants increase their power \nequally is another matter, however.  \n \nThe third conception of power is diagrammatic and Foucauldian. Power is \nconceived as a technology - a series of strategies, techniques and practices -\nthat works on subjects. It is exercised though groups or organisations rather \nthan held or possessed or centred in them. Power is conceptualised as fluid \nand relational, exercised from innumerable points within civil society, the \neconomy and the state \u2013 thus many agencies and institutions are involved \nwithin productive networks of power. The key issue is that of the techniques \nthrough which the conduct of others is moulded and their range of actions \nlimited and processes of governing enacted \u2018at a distance\u2019. Thus power is \nseen as \u2018productive\u2019 as people are subjectively constituted via routinised and \nritualised practices etched in disciplinary modes of power that have a \nhegemonic, unquestioned existence.  \n \nThe Foucauldian notion of power\/knowledge and concept of power as fluid \nand relational emphasises state\/civil society relations in systems of governing. \nThe focus is not upon who has power or the right to know\/not know (that is, on \na search for a single universal locus of power) but upon \u2018matrices of \ntransformation\u2019 and the complex diffusion and inter-relation of power \nthroughout society. Nonetheless, Foucault privileged the role of the state (the \n\u201cmacro-physics of power\u201d) as \u201cthe point of strategic codification of the \nmultitude of power relations (\u201cthe micro-physics of power\u201d) and the apparatus \nin which hegemony, meta-power, class domination and \u2018sur pouvoir\u2019 are \norganised\u201d (Jessop, 1990, 239).  \n \nConcepts of regions  \n \nEssentialist conceptions of regions are no longer intellectually tenable. \nRegions are not \u2018out there\u2019 waiting to be discovered. They are socially \nconstructed, both discursively and materially, in relation to specific criteria, \nalthough political actors and particular interest groups may seek to define and \ndefend them in essentialist terms. It is important to understand why this is so, \nnot least in relation to arguments about regional devolution, in two respects: \nfirst, the constructions of regions as objects of policy; secondly, the \nconstruction of regions as subjects of policy and issues such as who claims \nthe right to speak for the region, to define the region and its interests, \nprioritising some interests over others. As Councillor Bob Gibson, Vice Chair \nof the North East Assembly put it in September 2002: \u201cThe North East has a \nclear identity, geographically, culturally and historically. Of course there is \nmuch diversity within the region \u2026[b]ut where necessary the region can come \ntogether and speak with one voice\u201d (cited in Snapshot, September 2002). \n \nThis recent re-thinking of the region is predicated upon a strongly relational \napproach: regions are seen as constituted from spatialized social relations, \nstretched out over space and materialised in various form, and \n 3\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nrepresentational narratives about them (for example, see Amin, 2004). The \nspatiality of the dynamics of capitalism, the uneven geographies of their \nmechanisms of growth and decline and the stories told about them, represent \none way of conceptualising the processes underlying the (re)construction of \nregions. Regions can be seen as products of complex condensations of social \nrelationships, of varying density and variety, which combine contingently in \nspecific time\/space couplings to produce what are, in the last analysis, unique \nregions. The simultaneous combined and uneven development of particular \nregions reflects a shifting engagement with mechanisms of growth and \ndecline as these are stretched over space in the flux of real historical time \n(Harvey, 1982). \n \nThis relational approach therefore provides a way of thinking that discloses a \nregion which is by no means necessarily a whole, with the characteristics of \ncoherence which that term implies; nor is it necessarily a bounded and closed \nentity. Thinking about a region in terms of stretched out social relationships \nreveals a complex and unbounded lattice of articulations constructed through \nand around relations of power and inequality. It is a discontinuous lattice, \npunctured by structured exclusions, with intra-regional variation \u201cbecause of \nthe uneven nature of the overlay of different [defining] criteria\u201d (Allen et al., \n1998, 55-6). Each relational network has its own spatial reach, which may not \nbe coincident, although they may mutually influence one another. Intra-\nregional heterogeneity and discontinuity implies that, metaphorically, the \nfabric of regions is torn and ragged. Consequently, the issue is not how and \nwhether to draw lines around regions but to seek to understand the processes \nthrough which they are (re)produced (Hudson, 1990).  \n \nAllen et al. (1998, 143) argue that an adequate understanding of regions can \n\u201conly\u201d come about through conceptualising them as open, discontinuous, \nrelational and internally diverse. Furthermore, there is ample empirical \nevidence that, on average, the frequency, intensity and spatial reach of such \nextra-regional connections have tended to increase as the social relationships \nof capitalism have become more stretched and re-defined spaces in new \nways. However, the density and geography of linkages can decline as well as \nincrease in particular regions \u2013 for example, because of devalorisation and \ndisinvestment decisions by transnational companies or political decisions to \nseek a greater degree of regional closure precisely because of the character \nof extra-regional relations, linkages and distanciated network relationships. \nSocial and political actors often seek to increase the extent of regional closure \nand represent regions as closed, continuous and internally homogeneous \nand, as such, legitimate subjects seeking to shape policy. Consequently, \nwhile many of the social relations that help constitute regions traverse their \nimmanent boundaries and enrol extra-regional actors in the process of \nregionalisation, these trans-boundary relationships may, in some cases, \nproduce what may be termed \u201cclosure\u201d.2      \n \n                                                 \n2 This is a slightly different, but more nuanced, interpretation of the links between \u201copenness\u201d \nand \u201cclosure\u201d than I have previously argued (for example, see Hudson, 2001, Chapter 8). I am \ngrateful to Joe Painter for suggesting it and emphasising that territoriality can be the effect of \ncertain kinds of networked relationships.  \n 4\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nConcepts of the reorganisation of the state and scalar shifts in modes of    \ngoverning \n \nDrawing especially on recent changes in the European Union, Jessop (1997) \nrefers to the \u201creorganisation\u201d of the state as a triple process of de-nationalisation \n(hollowing out), de-statisation of the political system and the internationalisation \nof policy r\u00e9gimes. The extent to which regulation is carried out at sub-national \nscales is of particular relevance in the context of debates about devolution to \nregions. Such pressures \u2018from below\u2019 are generated by regionalist and \nnationalist movements, seeking to create more powerful sub-national spaces of \ngovernance and regulation within the boundaries of national states. However, \nnational states are not innocent and passive by-standers in these processes of \nterritorial decentralisation of power and\/or responsibilities. For example, states \nmay seek to preserve the integrity of their national territory via granting \nincreased autonomy to regions within their boundaries or seek to contain fiscal \ncrises by devolving responsibility (but not commensurate resources) for \neconomic development to regions.  \n \nThese varied pressures have reinforced tendencies to shift regulatory practices \nfrom the national level and so bring about qualitative changes in relationships \nbetween national and regional levels. It is, however, important not to overstate \nthe extent of such changes. There is a long-established sub-national territorial \nstructure to state power in response to requirements for administrative efficiency \nand political legitimacy. Increasingly, however, there have also been pressures \nfurther to shift the power to shape policies for regions to the regional level. This \ninvolves decentralisation of the power to decide and resources to implement \ndecisions rather than regions simply administering central government policies, \nwhich is intended to produce a greater correspondence between administrative \nspaces and the meaningful spaces of the regional life world. As a result, more \ncomplex architectures of political power and spaces of governing have emerged. \n \nAs well as scalar shifts, there has been a change in emphasis from government \nto governance in systems of governing. Regulatory capacities have been shifted \n\"outwards\" to non-state organisations with enhanced significance placed upon \nsocial practices beyond the state. A range of organisations and institutions \nwithin civil society has been incorporated into processes of governance. This \nhas been particularly associated with the promotion of network concepts and \nnetworked forms of regional governance (Hadjimichalis and Hudson, 2003). The \ngrowing emphasis on governance is recognition of the increasing importance - \nor perhaps more accurately is increasing recognition of the importance - of the \ninstitutions of civil society in securing the conditions under which the economy is \npossible. It acknowledges the social constitution of the economy, the embedding \nof the economy in cultural forms and political arrangements. \n \nIn summary, the reorganisation of the national state involves moving regulatory \ncapacities between scales within state structures and outwards from the state \ninto the institutions of civil societies and back into the economic institutions of \nmarkets. The concept of reorganisation denotes the emergence of new, more \ncomplicated structures of governing, involving re-defined relations between \neconomy, society and state and complex links within multi-scalar systems of \n 5\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \ngoverning. However, this does not resolve the problems stemming from crisis \ntendencies in state activity but transposes them to different spatial scales and \ninto civil society or back into the economy. Moreover, national states retain a key \nrole as \u201cscale managers\u201d, shaping decisions about scalar shifts in regulatory \ncapacity, serving as centres of persuasion and authors of narratives about \nchange and reform and centres of interpretation and dissemination of \nknowledge about experiences elsewhere (Peck, 2003, 357).  The critical issue is \nnot the demise but the character of the national state, the type of regulatory \nr\u00e9gime that it maintains, the geometry of that r\u00e9gime and the extent to which it \ninvolves devolution to the regional scale, and the form of capitalist economy that \nit seeks to encourage.  \n \nConcepts of governmentality  \n \nThe Foucauldian concept of governmentality further illuminates the processes \nof reorganising the state and attempts to create the region as a political \nsubject and the regional as a new scale of governing. While the emphasis on \nthe national as the dominant space and spatial scale of regulation can be \nseen as expressive of one governmentality, the shift to concepts of multi-level \ngovernance and of re-defined boundaries between economy, civil society and \nstate in the processes of governing can be seen as both indicative and \nconstitutive of another governmentality. Not least, the spatial object of policy \nand the spaces of governing are seen to encompass more than just the \nnational.  \n \nGovernment can be defined as \u201cany more or less calculated and rational \nactivity, undertaken by a multiplicity of authorities and agencies, employing a \nvariety of techniques and forms of knowledge, that seeks to shape conduct by \nworking through our desires, aspirations, interests and beliefs, for definite and \nshifting ends and with a diverse set of relatively unpredictable consequences, \neffects and outcomes\u201d. A mentality might be described as \u201ca condition of \nforms of thought and is thus not amenable to be comprehended from within its \nown perspective. The idea of mentalities, then emphasises the way in which \nthe thought involved in the practices of government is collective and relatively \ntaken-for-granted, that is, is not usually open to questioning by its \npractitioners'\u2019 (Dean,1999, 11-16).  There are clear similarities to the doxic \nqualities of Bourdieu\u2019s (1977) concept of habitus and Gramsci\u2019s (1971) \nconcept of hegemony.  \n \nBringing \u2018government\u2019 and \u2018mentality\u2019 together, governmentality emphasises \nthe how rather than the why questions and the structures of government and \ngoverning. Governmentality \u201cis intrinsically linked to the activities of expertise, \nwhose role is not one of weaving an all-pervasive web of \u2018social control\u2019, but \nof enacting assorted attempts at the calculated administration of diverse \naspects of conduct through the countless, often competing, local tactics of \neducation, persuasion, inducement, management, incitement, motivation and \nencouragement\u201d (MacKinnon, 2000, 296). Moreover, such activities are \nterritorially-demarcated. Space is an important element of governmentality \nbecause \u201cto govern it is necessary to render visible the space over which \ngovernment is to be exercised. And this is not simply a matter of looking: \n 6\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nspace has to be re-presented, marked out\u201d (Thrift, 2002, 205), emphasising \nthat regions need to be defined, represented and marked out, as both objects \nand subjects of governing.  \n \nThis thereby locates the space of the region as one element in wider circuits \nof power and regards the specific activities of those acting as or for the region \nas themselves to be explained  - the black box of the region must be opened \nup to explain how it can perform as a political subject.  The creation of such a \nregional bloc can only be achieved through the successful realisation of \nspecific regional projects that unite diverse social actors around a distinct line \nof action in the regional interest. However, achieving such unity is always a \ncontingent matter. Even if it is achieved, however, there is no guarantee that \nsuch projects will always and only have their intended effects precisely \nbecause of the inability to anticipate the emergent properties of practices.  \n \nThe concept of governmentality has several significant consequences relating \nto issues of regions, regional policies and regional devolution. The first relates \nto the constitution of the objects, subjects and spaces of government. For \nexample, regional economies are constituted via regional statistics, which \nhave a key role in \u2018making economies visible\u2019 and constituting them as objects \nfor policy action. Secondly, Latour (1987, 237-40) emphasises the key role of \n\u201ccentres of calculation\u201d, critical nodes in which information on distant objects \nis brought together, compared, combined, and aggregated via use of \nmathematical and statistical techniques, thereby enabling government to \u201dact \nat a distance\u201d on objects, such as regions, through its programmes and \npolicies. Thirdly, it highlights \u201cthe specific mechanisms, procedures and tactics \nassembled and deployed as particular programmes are materialised\u201d \n(MacKinnon, 2000, 295) and through which governmental programmes are \nactivated and put into practice. Particular techniques and practices become \ngovernmental because they can be made practical, transformed into concrete \ndevices for managing and directing reality. Inscription (for example, writing \ndown agreed quantitative targets for regional economic growth) and \ncalculation are key technologies, \u201cresponsibilising\u201d and disciplining actors to \nthe claims of central authority (Rose, 1996). These technologies render reality \n\u201cstable, mobile, comparable, combinable\u201d, enabling government to act on it \n(Rose, and Miller, 1992, 185).  \n \nSuch moves are not unproblematic, however. For example, there are tensions \nbetween decentralisation to regions and the development of new managerial \ntechnologies at national level to steer the activities of regional agencies and \nensure that they deliver national policy objectives. Regional spaces become \nsimultaneously objects and subjects of national government, and via \u201cthe \ncombination of flexibility and standardisation (that is, different levels, same \ntargets) \u2026 gives governmental technologies their utility as instruments for \nmanaging space\u201d (MacKinnon, 2000, 309). However, granting a degree of \nautonomy to enable regions to become political subjects also creates the \npossibility of enclosure, an empowering capacity to resist the intentions of \ncentral government towards those regions as objects of its policies and create \n 7\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \ncapacity for the elaboration of alternative regional projects, indicative of the \nmore general contradictory tendencies that plague state policies3.  \n \n \nThe case of north-east England: the construction of a region \nand the campaign for devolution  \n \nHistorical antecedents: constructing a new governmentality and the \nconstruction of north east England as a region in the 1920s and 1930s  \n \nThe dominant liberal mode of regulation on the Great Northern Coalfield in the \nfour decades from the 1870s gave primacy to the market as a resource \nallocation mechanism, asserted the common interest of \u201cmasters and men\u201d  \nand restricted the role of the state to the establishment, maintenance and \nregulation of markets (Moore, 1974). The dominat organisations within these \nnew arrangements were a small number of vertically-integrated coal \ncombines, with  the bulk of their capital fixed within the region (Carney et al, \n1977; Hudson, 1989)4. However, these arrangements increasingly came \nunder pressure, especially in the depression of the 1920s as the boom \nconditions of the war-time economy evaporated and export markets for coal, \nsteel and ships collapsed. Increasingly, the existing mode of regulation \nbecame untenable, as the practices of governmentality in which it was \ngrounded became fragile and contested. The majority of combine interests \nreacted in the same way. Locked into a liberal governmentality, the problem \nas they saw it was that the war had \u201cdistorted 'normal trade\u201d, so the solution \nlay in restoring the previous mode of regulation, cutting wages and raising the \nnumber of hours worked.  This resulted in chronic mass unemployment. In the \nLiberal world this could only happen because the cuts were not severe \nenough. Thus the failure of the policy in practice resulted in its intensification.  \n \nWhile there was an active search for 'new' solutions appropriate to the new \nconditions, especially after the general strike of 1926 when the dangers to \nsocial stability of single-minded wage cutting were amply demonstrated \n(especially to non-coal combine capitalist interests: Gilbert, 1976, Chapters 10 \nand 11), in practice these made things worse. Influential members of \ncombines in the north-east were appalled at the damage done to their \ninterests (economic and political) by the failures of both the old mode of \nregulation and the politics of reaction that these failures set in motion in the \n1920s. By the early 1930s, therefore, the liberal mode of regulation and the \n                                                 \n3 Rose and Miller (1992, 190) more generally argue that an unintended consequence of \nconcentrations of expert knowledge is that they can give rise to \u201cenclosures\u201d, tightly bound \nsites of vigorously defended professional expertise, resistant to the wishes of government. \n4 Harvey (1917) coined the term \u2018coal combine\u2019 to denote capitalist enterprises rooted in the \n\u2018coal economy\u2019 that had diversified into other activities and were linked into oligopolistic \ngroupings that dominated economy and politics in the region. In addition, they were \nconnected by non-economic relationships, including those of family, friendship, and shared \nreligion. This puts the recent emphasis upon the importance of such linkages and \u201cuntraded \ninter-dependencies\u201d (discussed below) into historical context and emphasises the dangers of \nconfusing changes in thought about the economy with changes in the economy itself (cf. Hall, \n1991). \n 8\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nconception of governmentality in which it was embedded were shattered but it \nwas unclear as to what might replace them.  \n \nBy the mid-1930s, however, there was evidence of an emergent alternative \ngovernmentality and a considerable commitment in the north-east to search \nfor a new mode of regulation and new policies, to explore the possibilities for \ncapital in selective state intervention and protectionism to defend \u2018regional \ninterests\u2019. Capitalist interests succeeded in bringing about two critical and \nrelated developments: the definition and \u201cmaking visible\u201d of the north-east as \na region, and as a particular sort of \u201cproblem region\u201d; and the shaping of \nemergent forms of state policy to address those problems, the transition from \na liberal to interventionist mode of regulation as an integral part of creating a \nnew governmentality regarding relationships between capital and the state \nand the objects of state policy (Carney and Hudson, 1978; Hudson 1989; \nHudson, 2005). Chambers of Commerce, as collective representatives of \ncapital, played a key role in this.  Since  the capital represented in the \nChambers was mainly tied up within the region, they realised the possibilities \nof representing their problems as a regional problem and seeking to resolve \nthem as such. The coal combines argued the need to ensure that conditions \nfor continued capital accumulation in the region were reproduced, while \nrepresenting this as in the regional interest. Consequently, they sought to \nconstruct a new governmentality, incorporating an interventionist mode of \nregulation that would re-define the relationship between capital and state, \ndefine the region as an object of regional policy, accord a central role to the \nstate in attracting new industries and install the representatives of the \ncombines as key actors in the new state institutions that would administer the \nnew regional policies.  \n \nBy the mid-1930s, therefore, combine and allied interests had successfully \nprosecuted a political strategy that made the case for new and radically \ndifferent policies. The establishment of a Commissioner for the Special Areas \nin England and Wales in 1934 signalled that national government accepted \nthe need for a major policy shift, defining and representing \u201cSpecial Areas\u201d as \nobjects of state policy that could be acted on \u201cat a distance\u201d. This was a shift \nin the dominant conception of governmentality that was to have wider \nconsequences as regions became the objects of specific regional policies. \nWithin the region, the formation, in 1935, of the North East Development \nBoard (NEDB) was equally significant. Its initial aim was to allow \"the \nexchange of opinions and concerted action on non-party lines by \nrepresentatives of a great variety of interests who have no other common \nmeeting ground.\"  As such, the Board sought to broaden the class basis of \nsupport for the new regional development policies and construct it on a cross-\nclass regionalist basis. By 1938, its membership included several Labour \nMembers of Parliament, many local authority representatives and several \ntrade unionists and members of the Industrial Advisory Council as the NEDB \nclaimed the right to speak for the region and promote its interests. \n \nThe policy tentatively adopted by the NEDB was elaborated in 1943 by the \nNorthern Industrial Group (NIG). The Group, the membership of which bore \nmore thana passing resemblance to the NEDB, was formed to discuss the \n 9\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nproblems that would arise on the \u201creconversion\u201d from a war-time to a \npeace-time economy in the region. The NIG\u2019s publication \"Considerations \nAffecting PostWar Employment in the North East\" emphasised that state \nintervention would be necessary to facilitate the short-period \u201c'reconversion\u201d of \nthe regional economy to peace-time production. Indeed, it assumed that such \nintervention ought to occur and be instrumental in achieving economic and \nsocial ends, not least by attracting inward investment to diversify the economy \nand help guarantee \u201cfull employment\u201d in the region and the stem out-migration \nfrom it. The Group also had a clear view as to the form that such state \nintervention should take, based upon the wartime experience of its members \nin positions of executive power in the state apparatus. These experiences \nfurther increased support for the transition to an interventionist mode of \nregulation of the economic and social life in the region. This marked shift from \nthe old Liberal fear of state intervention reflected the confidence of its private \nsector proponents that they could shape the activities of the state to their own \nrequirements while representing these as in the general regional interest. \n \nThis was further confirmed when the NIG circulated its November 1944 \n\"Memorandum on the Government White Paper on Employment Policy\u201d. The \nWhite Paper suggested that in Development Areas there would be regionally \norganised branches of central Government Departments concerned with \nindustrial location policy. The Group Memorandum responded to these \nproposals as follows: \"We would like to emphasise strongly that success \ndepends upon quick decision and that this will not be obtained unless the \nvarious Government Departments in Whitehall delegate full authority to their \nregional representatives\u201d. However, this administrative decentralisation would \nbe ineffective unless other changes were made. The Group considered it \"to \nbe of vital importance that the Government regional organisation should have \neffective executive responsibility\" and that such an organisation should \"... \nmaintain close contact with and be advised by a parallel group representing \nemployers, employees and other interests in the area. The Northern Industrial \nGroup and the North East Development Association because of their widely \nrepresentative character and the work which they are already carrying out, \ncan advise in many ways any Government regional organisation which may \nbe established\" (NIG, 1944, 11, my emphasis).  \n \nThis radical change in the conception of the most appropriate governmentality \nand mode of regulation, incorporating an enhanced form of devolution to the \nregion, clearly reflected the perception by the NIG that it had successfully \nprosecuted political strategies that secured the interests of private capital in \nthe north-east, and had succeeded in defining these as synonymous with the \ngeneral regional interest. The enrolment of trades union leaders and Labour \nMembers of Parliament into the coalition reflected their perception, grounded \nin a reformist Labourist politics, that this offered the best (or perhaps more \naccurately least bad and only possible) option of securing employment for \ntheir members and constituents. Seeking to create a sense of a shared \nregional interest involved attempting to ensure that the \u201cspatial reaches\u201d of \neconomic, political and cultural processes coalesced to form the boundaries of \nthe region \u2013 or at least were widely perceived to do so \u2013 conferring a \ndistinctive and shared north-eastern identity to those that lived within these \n 10\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \ncommon boundaries. Moreover, this establishment of a cross-class regionalist \nproject had an enduring effect over the next sixty years of development \npolicies in and for the region as it became a \u2018state managed region\u2019 (Hudson, \n1989). It can be seen as the predecessor of a succession of regional plans \nand development strategies, grounded in a cross-class consensus as to what \nwas \u2018good for the region\u2019, and administered by the \u2018usual suspects\u2019 within the \nstate, private sector companies and organisations and the trades unions, \ntypically male and middle aged (Robinson et al. 2000).  \n \nCrucially, however, these remained regionalisations of central government \npolicies and initiatives, an administrative devolution rather than one that \ndevolved the power to act, the power to decide on policy and commensurate \nresources to enable regional organisations to implement their policy choices \n(see Hadjimichalis and Hudson, 2003). In so far as business concerns in the \nregion felt that they were able to secure their interests via these arrangements \nthey were content to rest with administrative devolution, as were those in the \nlocal political elites and dominant strata who were satisfied that these \narrangements helped secure their own power and influence within the region. \nHowever, the lack of political devolution and meaningful transfer of powers \nand resources to make policy and decisions within the region continued to \nrankle with other regional politicians and fractions of political strata in the \nregion. \n \n \nSixty years on: regional economic success stories and contemporary \narguments for regional devolution  \n \nDuring the 1980s voices began to be raised arguing for constitutional reform, \ndecentralising some power to elected regional assemblies, as a way of \ntackling more effectively problems of unemployment, inequality and poverty in \nthe region (Byrne, 1990). During the 1990s these voices became more \nnumerous. The contemporary case for a Regional Assembly in the north-east \nhas been informed by a variety of arguments, many of which are shared by \nCabinet Ministers and powerful political voices within the north-east. They \nmay be summarised as follows.  First, devolution would also bring benefits in \nterms of new forms of participative democracy, greater political accountability \nand transparency in the policy making process within the region. An elected \nRegional Assembly would eliminate the democratic deficit created by its \nunelected predecessor and bring a new style of politics, centred on \npartnership and stakeholder engagement. Secondly, existing forms of top \ndown regional economic policy, through which central government acted at a \ndistance on the region, had manifestly failed and been rendered obsolete by \nthe neo-liberal globalising economy. This made the north-east an attractive \nspace for those seeking to promote concepts of devolution that went beyond \nexisting forms of administrative devolution. Thirdly, an elected assembly \nwould strengthen the position of the north-east in the competition for inward \ninvestment and associated new employment.  The north-east, along with the \nother English Regions, has from 1999 had its own Regional Development \nAgency, ONE NorthEast, but this is seen as weak and lacking political \nlegitimacy, financial resources and powers. Fourthly, those regions in the late \n 11\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nmodern world of the European Union and the USA that have been successful \nin making the transition to a \u2018high road\u2019 of economic development, regional \neconomic \u2018success stories\u2019 such as Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the Third Italy and \nSilicon Valley, are characterised by devolved forms of governance and \nregulation and this is seen as causally related to their economic success.  \n \nCritically, the stories told about these regions have led to claims \u2013 more \naccurately assertions \u2013 that regional economic success is based upon two \nconditions that are seen as both necessary and sufficient: first, that of a \ndevolved political system, so that regions form a scale or layer in a system of \nmulti-level governance; secondly, that the governance system extends \nbeyond the state to encompass a range of organisations and institutions \nlocated in civil society. Together, these state and non-state institutions interact \nand coalesce to form supportive and enabling regional institutional formations, \nregistered in concepts such as \u2018institutional thickness\u2019 (Amin and Thrift, 1994), \n\u2018untraded interdependencies\u2019 (Storper, 1995) or \u2018learning regions\u2019 (Morgan, \n1995). Consequently, it is claimed that in order to be economically successful \nin the neo-liberal world regions must become pro-active subjects responsible \nfor their own developmental trajectory and fate rather than simply passive \nobjects of central state policies. Moreover the role of the central state is to \nrecognise and facilitate this by devolving power and resources to regions as \npolitical actors (Hadjimichalis and Hudson, 2003). \n \nThis understanding of the determinants of regional economic success has led \nto normative claims that other regions, especially marginalized and peripheral \nregions such as north-east England, must become part of devolved political \nsystems and develop such regionally-specific organisational and institutional \nformations if they are to improve their economic fortunes. For some this is \nsimply a necessary condition, recognising that regions remain open \nconstructions subject to a variety of externally originating forces. For others, \nhowever, necessity slides into sufficiency and leads to regionalist claims that \nregional devolution guarantees regional economic success, based upon a \nsimplistic causal model but legitimated and given credibility by appeals to the \nre-organisation of the state thesis and a particular and partial interpretation of \nregional success stories. \n \nHowever, at this point it is important to enter a caveat about these success \nstories. Whilst some herald them as egalitarian and progressive \ndevelopmental models, others see them in a very different light. For example, \nHadjimichalis and Papamichos (1990) argue that the economic success of \nmuch of the Third Italy was grounded in regressive gender divisions of labour \nand patriarchal arrangement that forced women and children to work for long \nhours, sometimes through the night, in poor working conditions. Often the \nbasis of profitability was the exploitation of immigrant labour. Similarly it is \nworth recalling that in regions such as Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, California and \nmuch of the Third Italy migrant workers form a substantial proportion of the \nlabour force, with many illegal immigrants or on legal migrants on fixed-term \n 12\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \ncontracts renewable (or not) on an annual basis. This hardly smacks of a \nsocially progressive developmental model to be emulated elsewhere5.  \n \nThis emphasises the need to be cautious and critical of the way the regions \nand regional success are conceptualised and presented. Clearly, as noted \nabove, there has been a considerable debate about this in recent years. \nRegions and the criteria against which regional success is to be gauged are \nsocial and political constructions. As such, different social groups and \nfractions seek to claim the right to speak for the region, to define success in \nparticular ways, and typically in the process seek to present a sectional or \nparticularistic interest as the regional interest. Thus those who seek to argue \nfor regional devolution typically do not do so in a disinterested way or in a way \nthat seeks to promote some universal regional interest but as part of a \nstrategy to advance particular interests as the regional interest. For example, \nfractions of the political strata see regional devolution and devolved regional \ninstitutions as a way of promoting particular political projects and interests \nwhile others seek to oppose them precisely because they would be inimical to \ntheir interests. Nor is this a new process. As illustrated above, in the 1930s \nrepresentatives of major capitalist interests in north-east England sought to \nconstruct a particular representation of the region as problematic and argue \nfor state policy solutions to address these problems precisely as a way of \nseeking to protect and promote their own interests as owners of capital. In \nanalogous fashion the policies of the Regional Development Agency created \nin 1999 are strongly shaped by business interests \u2013 and this is clearly one \nreason for the opposition of business leaders to the proposed elected \nRegional Assembly, which would have taken responsibility for the regional \ndevelopment agenda and management of the regional economy. As the \nDeputy Prime Minister, John Prescott recently put it in discussing the RDAs: \n\u201cWe made them business-led. We represented their interests and what they \nare fighting to keep now is the RDAs\u201d (cited in Blitz and Tighe, 2004). \n \n \nTowards a critique of regional devolution, regional planning and \nregional strategies in north-east England \n \nAs the most recent Index of Multiple Deprivation data (ODPM, 2004b) make \ndramatically clear, much of the north-east remains blighted by very high levels \nof multiple deprivation despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 its history of \nplanning and state involvement. Actively addressing the needs of most people \nliving in the north-east, but in particular those of its most disadvantaged \nresidents, would therefore require more radical changes than implied by a \ndegree of constitutional reform and regional devolution directly to confront \nquestions of power and control over the production and distribution of goods \nand services. In this, the relationship between private capital and the \ninstitutions of central, regional and local government would need to be \nexamined, as would their relationship to dominant social groupings in the \n                                                 \n5 Indeed, the recent (2004) industrial unrest in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, especially in the \nautomobile plants of Chrysler-Daimler, is indicative of the limits to such a developmental \nmodel. \n \n 13\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nregion. For a few years in the 1950s and 1960s it looked as if the interests of \ncapital, the state and a majority of working people and their families could be \nmade to seem compatible in the region via state planning, but it soon became \nclear that this was an illusion. Planning in this context meant at best a weak \nform of indicative planning - a mixture of carrot and stick, through which the \nstate attempted to persuade or bribe private capital to behave in certain ways. \nThere were only limited controls on private capital, and certainly no powers to \nmake it do anything other than what it perceived to be in its best interests. \nConsequently, attempts to persuade capital to behave in line with the \nprojections of state indicative plans were a dismal failure.  \n \nWhere there was formal state control, via nationalisation, things were little \nbetter and expansionist plans very soon became translated into \nuncoordinated plant closures, job cuts and crisis management as the \nexperience of nationalisation proved disastrous for the north-east. This is not \nto argue that public ownership per se should be rejected but rather to \nacknowledge that the particular form adopted - in particular the nationalised \nindustry - ought to be. Rather than becoming a mechanism for more rational \nindustrial planning advancing the interests of the majority of the population of \nworkers and consumers, nationalised industries became state-controlled \ncompanies promoted a savage form of restructuring that paid scant regard to \nthe sensitivities of people in their places. However, to argue that all economic \nplanning - in the ex-ante sense of making decisions about the allocation of \noutput ahead of production - is rendered impossible by the deepening of the \nsocial divisions of labour to the point where this takes on causal powers \nindependent, and beyond the reach, of the social relations of production \n(Sayer and Walker, 1992, pp. 224-30) is overly pessimistic. To dismiss all \nalternatives to an ex-post validation of production via the market simply \nbecause of the collapse of the command economies of the USSR and its \nformer Eastern European satellite states is to go too far. History in this sense \nis not yet at an end. There may well be feasible possibilities for more rational \neconomic planning that are sensitive to the specificities of regions such as \nnorth-east England \u2013 especially if there is some re-conceptualisation of \u2018the \neconomy\u2019 and what it denotes. Certainly, discovering and constructing them \nremains a task to be undertaken but that is a very different matter from an a \npriori ruling of such possibilities from the agenda.  \n \nHowever, as of now they are very far from that agenda and denying this would \ncarry grave political dangers. The political strategies of the last sixty years in \nand for the north-east prioritised the interests of big capital and central \ngovernment over those of local communities, local people, workers and their \nfamilies. If the interests of the latter are to be prioritised, then a radical change \nin political priorities will be required as well as in the spatial formation of \npolitics in the UK and the UK state (Amin et al, 2003). This may involve a \ngreater degree of regional devolution as a necessary condition but this in itself \ncan never be sufficient.  From the perspective of what we might term the \nfallacy of the lump of power, regional devolution can be seen in terms of an \nessential and finite quantity of power, which remains centred in the state, but \nsome of which is re-allocated and devolved from the central (national) state to \nregions. Thus power is devolved but on terms decided by the central state. In \n 14\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nFoucauldian terms, there are micro-circuits of power widely diffused within \ncivil society, economy and state but the national state retains a key privileged \nmacro-scale role; decisions as to what to devolve and what targets devolved \nregional government must meet continue to be decided in the centre.  \n \nAttempts to create networked forms of power in and for the region, building on \nthe long history of collaboration between social classes and groups within the \nregion around a regional agenda, have been demonstrably inadequate in \nseeking to confront the structural power of capital and the structural \nimperative upon the national state to subordinate interests located within the \nregion to the national interest and the dependency of the state upon the \naccumulation process. Moreover, such networks characterised by \nasymmetrical power relations within them, pre-date social scientists thinking \nabout governance and policy in network terms (Hadjimichalis and Hudson, \n2003). Indeed the construction of networked forms of power in the region has \nboth reflected and reinforced the position of those possessing structural \npower rather than empowering the multitude in the region.  \n \nThe issue therefore is not whether devolved government can create power in \nand for the region but the limits that the relationships between capital, the \nstate and civil society impose upon the scope and content of state activity \u2013 \nwhether at national or regional scale \u2013 and the interests that are prioritised in \nstate policy agendas as the state seeks to navigate the perilous path between \nthe dangers of accumulation and legitimation crises. In this context, the switch \nfrom an emphasis on (albeit weak indicative) regional planning to regional \nstrategies (ONE NorthEast, 1999) is more than simply semantic. Above all, it \nregisters the dominance of a neo-liberal governmentality in which the best that \ncan be imagined for regions such as the north-east is to ride with the tide of \nneo-liberal globalisation, and seek to adapt the region to capture some mobile \ncapital investment and low grade, poorly qualified jobs in competition with \nother regions (and cities and national territories) globally on the low road to \nregional development. The region then becomes the political subject that \nnegotiates this engagement with processes of neo-liberal globalisation and \nthe region\u2019s place within them.  \n \nThere is no doubt that a minority in the region, predominantly drawn from \nparticular political strata and social classes, would continue to deploy the \nrhetorical devices of the region and its interests as a way of protecting and \npromoting their interests in this global context. There is a long history of this \nand no doubt it would continue to be the case were there to be an elected \nRegional Assembly and more devolved forms of regional governing. Whether \nmuch would change for the better for the vast majority of people living in the \nregion remains a moot point. For example, the post-devolution experiences of \nScotland and Wales suggest that the harshest impacts of neo-liberal \nglobalisation can be softened at the margins but that there is scant scope to \nalter the economic development trajectories of these territories for the better. \nTherefore there are manifest political dangers in pinning the argument for \nregional devolution to the mast of regional economic success. This is only \nlikely to lead \u2013 once again - to unrealised expectations and disappointment, \ndiscrediting the concept of devolution per se and cutting the ground from \n 15\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nbeneath the other to-be-welcomed ways in which the concept of greater \npolitical devolution and regional accountability could enhance life in peripheral \nregions. There is a need for eternal vigilance to guard against the danger of \nallowing the pursuit of the Holy Grail of regional economic renewal and revival \nvia regional devolution to become the device through which the central state \nshifts the blame onto the victim for the continuing economic problems of \nperipheralised regions. The rejection of the offer of an elected Assembly in the \nnorth-east suggests that a majority of residents of the region are alert to these \nissues.  \n \nAt a minimum, prioritising the interests of the vast majority of people in the \nnorth-east would involve establishing a different conception of planning, and \neffecting a radical change in socio-economic priorities and in the mode of \nregulation and dominant governmentality. Whether this is feasible remains, at \nbest, an open question. It may well be, to borrow Offe\u2019s (1975) evocative \nphrase, the case that the impossible may be necessary and the necessary \nimpossible in terms of creating powers and resources at regional level that \nwould allow an effective determination of the regional economic development \ntrajectories that challenged the imperatives of capital accumulation. Maybe it \nis no longer feasible even to think of national, or even supranational, \nregulatory regimes which would allow effective planning via significant \ninfluence over, let alone control of, private capital's (dis)investment decisions, \nand even less the socialisation of key sectors of the economy. Perhaps there \nis no effective alternative to the disciplinary powers of the market and the law \nof value in determining the fate the regions \u2013 for better or, almost certainly, \nworse. If so, it is better, though painful, to recognise this so that people in \nareas such as the north-east can better understand the sort of future they face \nand make their choices accordingly and not raise yet more false hopes on the \nback of devolutionist assertions and claims about transferring power to the \nregion.  \n \n \nConclusions  \n \nAs I have illustrated, concepts such as those of power, state re-organisation \nand governmentality are helpful in understanding the developmental trajectory \nof north-east England, especially once this is located in the conceptualisation \nof the region as a discursive as well as a material construction. In this context, \nthe proposals for an elected Regional Assembly can be seen as expressive of \nan emergent neo-liberal governmentality, incorporating multi-level forms of \ngovernance, seeking to unite diverse social classes and groups around a \ncommon regionalist project. These proposals drew on a long history of cross-\nclass collaborative projects, which claimed to represent \u201cthe regional interest\u201d, \nand of administrative devolution whereby central government policies for the \nregion were executed by a small cadre in the region.  \n \nHowever, questions remain about the efficacy of the new governmentality and \nabout who would be its main beneficiaries in the region \u2013 and the rejection of \nthe offer of an elected Assembly suggests that these are not simply academic \nconcerns. The extent to which devolution would actually involve transferring \n 16\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \npower to the region and the capacity of networked forms of power within the \nregion to counter the structural power of capital and shape central state \npolicies remains unclear. Not least, the key players in the new forms of \ndevolved government would be substantially the same as in the previous \nforms of devolution \u2013 that is, the \u2018usual suspects\u2019 drawn from business and \npolitical elites in the region. Issues relating to asymmetries in power and the \nability of different social classes and groups within the region to realise their \ninterests would remain opaque. What is clear is that any notion of the region \nas a unified and coherent political subject pursuing policies (for example, via \nan elected Assembly) to further a shared regional interest is untenable. The \nrecent re-thinking of the region allows an escape from the limitations of the \nmyth of a unified (and unifying) regional interest and explicitly acknowledges \nthe existence of different \u2013 and at times openly competitive, grounded in \ndifferent class structural positions and sources of power \u2013 interests held by \nindividuals and social groups living in the same space. Within such an \nagonistic politics, which interests prevail and which are prioritised in state \npolicy agendas is the outcome of overtly political struggle based on a \nrecognition of difference \u2013 albeit a difference often grounded in structurally \nasymmetrical power relations - rather than a presumption of homogeneity of \ninterest on the basis of a shared regional identity. A consequence of this is \nthat defining regional economic success becomes problematic, since this \ncannot be divorced from distributional issues of equity within the region. What \ncan be safely stated is that, at a minimum, realising such alternative \nconceptions of development will require a lot more than simply some limited \ndevolution of political power within the structures of the state and systems of \nmulti-level and multi-scalar governing. But that must remain the subject of a \ndifferent paper \u2026. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAllen J, 1997, \u201cEconomies of power and space\u201d in Lee R and Wills J (Eds.) \nGeographies of Economies, Arnold, London, 59-70. \n \nAllen J, 2003, Lost Geographies of Power, Blackwell, Oxford. \n \nAllen J, 2004, \u2018The whereabouts of power: Politics, government and space\u2019, \nGeografiska Annaler, B,19-32.   \nAllen J, Cochrane A and Massey D, 1998, Re-thinking the Region, Routledge, \nLondon. \nAmin A, 2004, \u2018Regions unbound: towards a new politics of place\u2019, \nGeografiska Annaler, B,33-44.   \nAmin A, Massey D and Thrift N, 2003, Decentering the Nation: a radical \napproach to regional inequality, Catalyst, London. \nAmin A and Thrift N, 1994, \u2018Living in the global\u2019, in Amin A and Thrift N (Eds.), \nGlobalization, Institutions and Regional Development in Europe, Oxford \nUniversity Press, Oxford, 1-22. \n 17\nRegional devolution and regional economic success \u2026final draft \n \nBeynon H and Hudson R, 1993, \u201cPlace and Space in Contemporary Europe: \nSome Lessons and Reflections\u201d, Antipode, 25, 177-190. \nBlitz R and Tighe C, 2004, \u201cPrescott rounds on business opposition\u201d, \nFinancial Times, \u201c20 November, p. 4. \nBourdieu P, 1977, Outline of a Theory of Practice, Cambridge University \nPress, Cambridge. \n \nByrne D, 1990, Beyond the Inner City, Open University Press, Milton Keynes. \nCarney J and Hudson R, 1978, \u201cCapital, politics and ideology: the North East \nof England,1870-1946\u201d, Antipode, 10, 64-78. \nCarney J, Hudson R and Lewis J, 1977, \u201cCoal combines and interregional \nuneven development in the UK\u201d, in Batey P and Massey D (Eds.), London \nPapers in Regional Sciences, Pion, London. \nDean   M, 1999, Governmentality: Power and Rule in Modern Society, Sage. \nLondon. \nGilbert M, 1976, Winston S Churchill, volume 5, 1922-39, Heinemann, \nLondon. \n \nGramsci A, 1971, Selections from the Prison Notebooks, Lawrence and \nWishart, London. \n \nHadjimichalis C and Hudson R, 2003, \u201cGeographical imaginations, \npost-modern imperialism and the project of European political \nintegration\u201d, Soundings, 23, 37-53. \nHadjimichalis C and Papamichos N, 1990, , \u201c'Local' development in southern \nEurope: towards a new mythology\u201d, Antipode, 22, 181-210. \nHall S, 1991, \u201cThe Local and the Global: globalization and ethnicity\u201d, in King A \nD (Ed.)
