It was found that staff adopted various techniques to guide the discussion and \nproduce certain kinds of statements and decisions. It could be said that in these cases, the staff were having \nto decide between two or more conflicting institutional objectives.  \nConclusion  The effect was that staff contributions sometimes produced interactional patterns which were \ncontrary to the goal of encouraging the residents to speak up and have more say in the management of their \nhome.  \n \nKeywords \nIntellectual disability, power, interaction, self advocacy, conversation analysis \n \nIntroduction \nThe recent UK government document \u2018Valuing People\u2019 (Department of Health, 2001), which set out the \nfuture priorities and principles for services for people with learning disabilities, stated that a major problem \nwith current services was that people with learning disabilities often have little choice or control over their \nlives.  As a result, it set out as a principle that people with learning disabilities should be encouraged to \nexpress and make their own choices, particularly in where they live and what they do.  This was to be \nachieved through person-centred approaches to planning which focus on the individual concerned rather \nthan the services involved, therefore enabling the needs and wishes of the individual to be the priority.   \n  \n \nAlthough a great deal of effort in recent years has been put into involving people with learning disabilities \nin decisions regarding aspects of their lives and also improving information and communication, research \nsuggests that lack of control and choice continue to be a problem in many services (e.g. Goble, 1999; \nGoodley, 2000). Whilst services attempt to address disempowerment through changing structures and \nservice philosophies, an important and less manageable site of power relations in people\u2019s everyday lives \nis their everyday interactions with service workers, family members and the wider community. Hugman \n(1991) suggested that service providers control the interests of service users through the interaction of \nlanguage and social relationships. A number of studies have highlighted how interactions between people \nwith learning disabilities and staff members are often asymmetrical (e.g. Antaki, Young & Finlay, 2002; \nCullen et al, 1983; Markov\u00e1, 1991; Prior et al, 1979). Markov\u00e1 (1991) noted that in the ritualised routines \nof institutional life, interactions between staff and people with learning disabilities could diminish to the \nextent that it would appear that staff were merely interacting with objects.  Leudar (1981) has suggested \nthat because of inequalities in knowledge and status, people with learning disabilities are often placed in \n\u2018non-reversible roles,\u2019 with fewer opportunities to express attitudes and feelings openly.  Prior et al (1979) \nreported that up to a third of all verbal interactions initiated by residents were ignored in a training centre \nfor young people with learning disabilities.  They explained that this type of response could result in \nextinction of such attempts to communicate. \n  \nMarkov\u00e1 (1991) examined what would happen if an attempt were made to try to restore the balance of \npower in communicative partnerships between people with learning disabilities and non-disabled \nindividuals.  Tutors involved in the advocacy movement were asked to participate in group discussions \nwith people with learning disabilities.  The tutors were given explicit instructions to participate in the \ndiscussion in the same way as the other participants.  They were also asked not to take on a didactic role \nbut to maintain conversation only if necessary.  It was found that despite the tutors\u2019 best intentions, \ndidactic patterns and non-response persisted.  It was reported that because the participants with learning \ndisabilities made no attempts to initiate discussion, tutors resorted to directing conversation and in this way \nthe imbalance of power was reconstructed as a vicious circle. \n  \nA number of articles have recently examined in detail the verbal behaviour of professionals and staff \nmembers in interaction with people with learning disabilities, and attempted to outline some of the effects \nof workers\u2019 attempts to manage these interactions (e.g. Antaki, 2001;Antaki & Rapley 1996;Antaki et al, \n2002; Rapley, 2004; Rapley & Antaki, 1996). These studies have illustrated a range of effects which are \ncounterproductive to the official goals of the interactions. For example, Antaki et al (2002) illustrated that \nuntrained care staff adopted a series of non-neutral practices in interviews designed to assess the \nsatisfaction of service users with learning disabilities regarding the services they received.  Staff were \nobserved offering evaluative feedback on interviewee responses, suggesting advice on the basis of \ninterviewees\u2019 answers, rejecting potentially valid answers, suggesting more elaborate accounts to the \ninterviewee than they had offered themselves, and reworking their responses. The latter included \nupgrading neutral or mildly positive statements or offering neutral or even positive reformulations of \npossible complaints. It was suggested that these deviations could have occurred as a result of the \ninterviewer intending to treat the recipient of care supportively and therefore being more inclined to \nacknowledge their general duty of care to the service user rather than their immediate task of evaluating \nthat care.  Rapley and Antaki (1996) provided extracts from assessment interviews between clinical \npsychologists and people with learning disabilities  and showed how, through the adoption of non-neutral \npractices to pursue a perceived correct response from the service user, \u2018the interviewee is shepherded into \nproducing pseudo-acquiescent responses\u2019 (p.213).  These non-neutral practices occur through \nreformulating service user responses, shepherding them to a response which conforms to the interviewers \n\u2018guess or stereotype of the interviewees\u2019 beliefs\u2019 (p.216), and treating service user responses as irrelevant.  \n \nThese studies reveal how despite the Government\u2019s continuing commitment and proposals and the good \nintentions of services to encourage empowerment for service users with learning disabilities, power \ndynamics persist through the imbalance of knowledge and status in interactions. This study aimed to use \nConversation Analysis to examine these processes further in a different context: residents\u2019 meetings in a \nhome for people with learning disabilities, which were set up to encourage empowerment.   \n \nConversation analysis (henceforth, CA) is the study of social action as achieved through the medium of \ntalk in interaction. Its genesis was in the dissatisfaction of some sociologists in the late 1960s with the then \ndominant quantitative methodologies of their discipline, which were silent on the active construction of the \nsocial world. In the forty years since the pioneering work of the group around Harvey Sacks (whose \nlectures were published posthumously as Sacks, 1992), CA has attracted enormous attention and flowered \ninto a multidisciplinary enterprise attracting sociologists, linguists and psychologists, among others (for an \naccount of the history of Conversation Analysis, see Heritage 1984; for a recent overview of its methods \nand style, see Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998).  Its signal characteristics are a reliance on recorded data which \ncan be minutely inspected; and an openness to the way the participants in a scene display their own \nunderstandings of what they are doing and saying, as evidenced in the exact organisation of their talk. The \noriginal sociological promise of CA to illuminate the way social structure is embodied in the detail of \nsocial action has been eminently fulfilled in a large number of both 'basic' and 'applied' research \nprogrammes. \n \nThe result is that the researcher interested in the way social participants conduct, in real time, their \nbusiness with each other, now has a powerful armoury of concepts and insights with which to approach \ntheir chosen topic. 'Basic' CA research has been applied productively to a variety of institutional activities \npreviously accessible only in retrospect (by interviews with participants) or in simulation, or through \ncomparatively coarse contemporary observation. For example, CA has been used in research on how talk \nin interaction achieves business meetings (Boden, 1994), educational testing (Maynard and Marlaire, 1992) \nand survey interviewing (Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000), to take a few notable examples and has yielded \nimpressive returns. Within the field of research on learning disability, CA has been used to study the \ncommunicative competence of people with a learning disability (e.g. Wootton, (1989), the practices of \ntheir assessment (e.g. Antaki, 1999) and the manner in which they manage their identities in interviews \n(e.g. Rapley, Kiernan and Antaki, 1998).  \n \n\"Power\", of course, means many things in the social science literature, but one common thread throughout \nis the observation that different participants in a scene will have (and be held to) different rights to \ncontribute. The virtue of taking this working definition of power is that it is available for public scrutiny, \nas it will reveal itself in the participants' own talk. This makes Conversation Analysis a particularly useful \napproach: as Hutchby puts it in a defence of CA in the analysis of power-asymmetry between host and \ncaller in a radio- phone in, \"By showing how participants display an orientation to institutional settings by \nengaging in certain activities and refraining from others, CA can [...] be used to illustrate how power, in \nthe sense of differential resource distributions, can be linked to those orientations\" (Hutchby, 1996, p 18-\n19). \n \nMethod \nData \nThe data consisted of audio footage, recording two residents meetings over two consecutive months at a \nprivately run residential care home for people with learning disabilities in the South-East of England.   \n \nResidents Meeting \nThe residents\u2019 meetings are semi-structured, in that the staff holding the meeting follow an agenda planned \nby the staff and manager prior to the meeting.  The agenda contains a list of items for discussion, such as \n\u2018Day Centres- is everyone happy with the present arrangements and activities,\u2019 \u2018Advocacy Service- does \neveryone know what this is,\u2019 \u2018Daily Menus-are we all happy with the present menu,\u2019 and \u2018Fire Procedures-\nDo we all know what to do in case of fire?\u2019  The meeting is attended by the residents and the staff on duty \nat the time.  The same eight residents attended both meetings over two months, however except for one \nmember of staff (Ann) who was present at both meetings, different staff attended each time.  At the first \nmeeting four staff members participated.  At the second meeting two staff members participated.  \nResidents\u2019 meetings enable staff and service users to convene on a regular basis.  There is no specific \npolicy followed by the home regarding residents\u2019 meetings, however a manager\u2019s definition was obtained \ndescribing the objectives of the meeting.  This is summarised below: \n \n1. To empower clients \n2. To discuss day-to-day issues\/concerns that clients may have. \n3. To offer a social venue to facilitate group interaction and communication with clients. \n \nStaff that held or participated in the meetings were also asked to give their perspective of the purpose of \nthe residents\u2019 meeting.   One staff member described the meeting as, \u2018A way of enabling clients to \nrecognise their own worth by having a say in the running of their home and therefore putting power into \ntheir lives.\u2019  Another staff member viewed the resident\u2019s meeting as a place where clients could air their \ngrievances and problems openly and discuss them as a group and as providing residents with the \nopportunity to make their own suggestions and contributions to future plans, for example regarding \nholidays and menu planning. \n  \nPermission \nBefore any data was collected, each staff member of the care home was sent a letter seeking his or her \npermission to participate in the study.  The letter also described the purpose of the research as an \ninvestigation of communication and interactions between staff members and service users with learning \ndisabilities.  A more simplified version of the letter was given and read out to each resident of the care \nhome.  This was then left with a member of staff, who went over the letter with them a few days later.  The \nletters were also used as consent forms, enabling staff and residents to indicate their willingness to \nparticipate prior to the commencement of the recordings (see appendix 4). \nFormatted: Bullets and\nNumbering\n Service Users with Learning Disabilities \nSix women and two men aged between 49 to 70 participated in this study.  The service users all had been \nliving in the residential care home for between ten months and eight years and had been labelled as having \nmild to moderate learning disabilities.  Descriptions of each service users\u2019 verbal abilities were collected \nfrom the members of staff who took part in the investigation.  These are summarised below.  \n \nNat  Very fluent \nKat  Very fluent although poor pronunciation and problems with articulation when upset. \nLyn Very quiet, speaks only if needs to communicate something.  Repetitive speech particularly if \nupset. \nVal  Very cheerful nature although needs to be given time to speak to be understood. \nKel  Most articulate of residents although does not tend to speak often. \nAmy Speaks through her nose but can be understood if listened to carefully.  Becoming more \nincomprehensible. \nZac  Says very little although always very clear and understandable. \nTim Knows what he wants to say but does not speak clearly.  Very fast and repetitive speech, often \ndifficult to catch.    \nStaff \nFour female members of staff (Ann, Alyson, Jennifer and Melanie) and one male member of staff (Jay) \nagreed to participate in the study.  All were between the ages of 41 and 66 and had been employed by the \nhome as care assistants for between 10 months and 6 years.  Two members of staff had completed a \ndiploma in care; other staff had participated in various forms of in-house training such as first aid and \nmanual handling.  All staff had a duty of care to the residents. \n  \nTranscription \nThe recordings (each approx 1 hour long) were transcribed using a coarser version of the Jefferson \nnotation used in conversation analysis (Atkinson and Heritage 1984) (see appendix 3 for description of \nconversation analysis notation), to show certain features present in the discourse.  All identifying details \nwere changed.  The names of staff in the extracts used to support the analysis were capitalised. \nInsert Figure 1 \nand Figure 2 \nabout here \nAnalysis \nThe analysis revealed different ways in which power relations were visible in interactions between staff \nmembers and people with learning disabilities. Throughout the recording, staff are seen to negotiate \nvarious roles with the residents, for example as chair of the meeting, teacher and supporter. Each of these \nroles implies different functions, all of which were seen repeatedly in all transcripts: responsibility for \ngetting through the agenda and allowing everyone to have a say; checking and rehearsing residents\u2019 \nknowledge in important areas, imparting new knowledge where necessary; and eliciting participants\u2019 views \nand opinions on matters of importance to them. The latter two roles are determined partly by the agenda, \nwhich included items both on eliciting residents\u2019 views (e.g. Day centres: is everyone happy with the \narrangements and activities?) and on checking their knowledge in various areas (e.g. \u201cDo we all know \nwhat to do in case of fire?\u201d \u201cUpdate residents on procedures for night and day,\u201d \u201cDo you know who\/what \nyour key-worker is?\u201d). The staff roles in the residents\u2019 meetings can therefore be seen as similar to their \neveryday roles in the life of the home.  In addition to these different roles, group members differ in their \ncommunicative abilities and this is another factor that staff have to negotiate.  However, these will not be \nthe focus of the paper.  In the residents\u2019 meetings, the direction of the conversation was determined by the \nstaff through the use of nominations, particular question types and attending to some utterances while \nignoring others.  In what we shall see, the effect of this leadership role led to conversational practices \nwhich were, in fact, at odds with the institutional objectives which the meetings were intended to serve. \n \nAlthough many examples of these patterns were found throughout the transcripts, we have focused here on \ntwo main themes: non-uptake of utterances and producing affirmations of service philosophies.  Staff \ncontrol of the interaction through non-uptake was frequently observed and seemed to arise in different \nforms.  For example staff members often nominated particular residents to speak with the result that the \nutterances of other residents were not acknowledged. In other instances, residents\u2019 utterances were \nacknowledged but then reformulated by the staff in such a way that the original statement or opinion was \nless of a challenge to the service. Producing affirmations of service philosophies involved inquiries which \nwere tailored towards producing positive statements relating to the service. Various patterns, such as pre-\nsequences and the use of rhetorical questions (for example \u2018isn\u2019t it?\u2019) were used, which had the effect of \nshepherding residents towards particular responses.  Staff were also observed providing clues to achieve \ncertain answers.  \n 1. Non-Uptake \nMany situations were observed showing staff either ignoring or barely acknowledging residents\u2019 attempts \nto communicate.  This was often seen when service users expressed concerns or showed preferences.   \n \na. Pursuing Appropriate Responses at the Cost of Ignoring Dissatisfaction \nThe discussion in the long extract below concerns the item in the agenda, \u2018Any complaints or comments?\u2019 \nand is taken from group one. We have included extracts from this lengthy interaction because it illustrates \nthe power of the group leader (a staff member) to determine which opinions, and whose opinions, get taken \nup in the group. We can see that Jay (a staff member) is leading the meeting, as illustrated by his raising \nagenda items, nominating speakers and by the fact that the other staff member (Ann) orients to this by \ntelling Lynn that she should address her remarks to him (lines 628 and 637). Whilst going around the room \nasking if any resident has any suggestions, one resident (Lyn) repeatedly tries to bring up her complaint, \nwhich is effectively disregarded. It is important to see how it comes about that Lyn's complaint finds no \nuptake: it is through the leader's pursuit of a different agenda item, namely the 'round-robin' solicitation of \nresponses to his question. Lyn's complaint is badly formatted for that. \n(1a) Staff: Jay, Ann, Residents: Lyn, Kat, Val, Nat\nJAY We talked about our weekly shopping (1.1) and  600 \ner (0.8)the last thing we\u2019re gonna talk about is any  601 \ncomplaints of of comments.  Anybody wants to change  602 \nanything, say anything?  (0.8) Something Kathy would  603 \nlike to say anything (1.8)or would like to see any changes? 604 \nLyn  Jay 605 \nKat  Nope 606 \nJAY  No 607 \nKat  Nope608 \n \n \nNotice that Kat's turn at line 606 is 'properly' formatted as a response to Jay's question. Lyn's turn at 605, \non the other hand, is formatted as a pre-announcement. The very fact that she bids for Jay's attention \ninteractionally implies that she orients to the fact that she has spoken \u2018out of turn\u2019 - otherwise she would \nhave no reason to have to make a point of catching his eye. Note also that Jay has made two different \ninvitations to the group \u2013 initially he asks the whole group if they want to say anything (line 601-3), but \nwhen there is no response in the short period of silence immediately after, he then nominates Kathy. \n \nAt this point, Jay could, of course, choose to attend to Lyn's bid, but he does not. We do not say that he \n'ignores it deliberately' (although it may seem so to Lyn). We prefer the reading that he chooses to pursue \nthe line of business he has already put in motion, and for which he is accountable: namely, seeing if people \naround the room have any complaints or want to see any changes. This is how he proceeds: \n \nJAY  Are you hap [py the way things are in here(1.5) 609 \nKat        [ummm 610 \nJAY Err.  (.23)Valerie would you like to see any  611 \nJAY changes (1) [What would you like to see. 612 \nLyn       [(I don\u2019t want to be retiring) 613 \nANN   umm (To Lynda)614 \n \nAt this point (line 613) Lyn makes the announcement she had prefigured in line 605: she doesn't want to \nretire (a reference to the loss of access to the day centre because of her age). But it is in competition with \nVal, who is now the nominated speaker: \n \nLyn  [I don\u2019t want to be retiring 615 \nVal  [I don\u2019t know 616 \nJAY  You don\u2019t know, (0.9)you can always  617 \nthink about it can\u2019 [t you?  618 \nVal           [Yes yes yes 619 \nJAY  Natalie?

To the degree that Lyn formats her \ninterventions inappropriately by speaking out of turn in the question\/answer round, she is 'ignorable'. \nRather than attending to Lyn, Jay chooses to finish his questioning of Kat and Val and then move on to \nnominate Nat.   \n \nThere is another member of staff present, and it is interesting that it is she (Ann) who attends to Lyn in a \nside-sequence or schism (Egbert 1997). It is distinctly not the main activity of the group. And even then, \nalthough Ann encourages Lyn to voice any issues she has (622), she responds to her with, \u2018I\u2019m not sure if \nthere is a lot we can do about that.\u2019  \n \nBetween lines 647-57, Jay continues his effort to resolve Nat\u2019s complaint by recommending that she use \nthis time to make suggestions such as having a game of bingo.  We take up the interaction again below in \nline 658, when Lyn again repeats her complaint, again using Jay\u2019s name to attract his attention.  Ann \naffirms it (660) and Lyn repeats it, but once more their attempts are not taken up; as before, Jay \nconcentrates on the contributions of the others. In this case it is Val, who has taken up his suggestion that \ngames are an appropriate topic for the meeting.  \n \n (1b) Staff: Jay, Ann, Aly Residents: Lyn, Val,\nLyn Jay, (1.20) I don\u2019t like retiring, (1.08) 658 \nI don\u2019t like retiring at the moment. 659 \nANN  [Lynda don\u2019t like retiring (To Jay) 660 \nVal  [Play a game of, play a game of (1.89)[skittles. 661 \nLyn                    [I don\u2019t like retiring 662 \nJAY  Did you (0.77) arrrh (To Valerie) 663 \nVal Y\u2019know place where the made [(in to some the grass)  664 \nare like to play a game of skittles  665 \nLyn                 [I don\u2019t like retiring (mumbles) 666 \nJAY  Arrrh did you? 667 \nVal  Somebody else somebody made it for us. 668 \nANN  [Have you decided where you want to go on holiday Zack? 669 \nALY  [Can\u2019t you do something else?

How about Kelly?676 \n \nInstead of pursuing Lyn\u2019s utterance,  Jay converses with Val about skittles (661-68), following his own \nearlier comment to Nat (646) that the types of things she might suggest here would be to have a game of \nbingo. During this time, Lyn\u2019s speech, in the face of (what must seem to her like) being ignored, becomes \nrepetitive and she reiterates her complaint four times (662, 666, 671, 672).  Jay not only does not take up \nLyn\u2019s complaint, but does not even acknowledge she has spoken. Instead he repeatedly nominates other \nresidents to speak.  \n \nIn all of this we are seeing a staff member, in order to pursue one task, do something which has the effect \nof what Markov\u00e1 (1991) described as putting a resident into a non-reversible role. This may result in a \ndebilitating effect on the speech of a person with learning difficulties (in this case, Lyn\u2019s behaviour begins \nto resemble \u2018echolalia\u2019).  In 673 Jay nominates Zack, a resident sitting beside Lyn (see fig 1 in Method).  \nZack does not respond to Jay however, consequently Lyn explains, \u2018He won\u2019t speak up\u2019 (675).  Jay\u2019s \nresponse to Lyn (676) suggests that this time he has heard her speak.  This is seen in the way he replies \n\u2018No,\u2019 to her explanation but rather than using this opportunity to ask Lyn if she has anything to say, Jay \nthen nominates the resident sitting on her other side.   \n \nFollowing a brief exchange between Jay and Kelly.  Lyn is finally invited to voice her opinions, and she \nrepeats her complaint in line 685 in extract 1c below. Jay\u2019s aim of nominating each resident to speak has, \nas we have been seeing, contradictory effects. On the one hand it ensures each person has an opportunity to \nspeak whilst on the other it interferes with spontaneous discussion and results in many valid (but out of \nturn) contributions being ignored.  We should also note that many of Lyn\u2019s utterances often overlap with \nthe speech of others (denoted by square brackets [), which is likely to be a further factor in their being \nignored. \n \n(1c) Staff: Jay, Ann, Residents: Lyn, Amy\nJAY How about Lynda?

Lyn finally has Jay\u2019s \nattention but despite this, his response is a brief acknowledgement that she has spoken, rather than an \nacknowledgement that she has a problem (688). After a hesitation, Jay then nominates Amy and using a \nnon-neutral question form, asks her if she is \u201chappy\u201d.  Note here that the agenda states \u2018Any complaints or \ncomments,\u2019 yet Jay departs from this neutrality in pursuit of confirming service users\u2019 happiness.  This is \nin accordance with Markov\u00e1 (1991)\u2019s discussion on the development of topic, where it is noted that tactical \nintentions can disrupt the natural progression of a topic.  Therefore if a staff member engages in dialogue \nwith preconceived notions of what is valid participation, then contributions estimated as unacceptable are \nrejected resulting in a \u2018monological dialogue\u2019 (p. 234).  This is seen from line 694-708, where Jay explains \nhow staff should not differentiate themselves from residents and should all work towards enhancing their \nquality of life.  Throughout this monologue, Lyn continues to express her complaint, but Jay simply talks \nover her (706-709).   \n \nIn line 710, in response to Lyn\u2019s perseverance, Ann says, \u2018Well you\u2019ve told Jay.\u2019  Jay now repeats Lyn\u2019s \ncomplaint (712) but rather than take it up he reframes it and presents her retirement as a positive situation, \nas an opportunity for her to be with the others at home. Although she resists this positive reframing of her \ncomplaint, again stating she doesn\u2019t like it (715), Val affirms Jay\u2019s positive statement (716)), and Jay \nagrees with Val about how agreeable his response to Lyn\u2019s problem is (717). In this extended interaction, \nLyn has stated she doesn\u2019t like retiring 14 times. Jay acknowledges her twice. The first time he quickly \nnominates another speaker, the second time he reframes her complaint as a positive.\n \n \n \nb. Dealing with opposition \nMaking suggestions and speaking about preferences are the main objectives of the residents\u2019 meeting.  \nHowever, there is a tension between staff encouraging residents to make their own choices and \nshepherding them towards choices which the staff, for various reasons, might prefer. Some of these \nreasons may well be institutionally appropriate, but the effect nevertheless is directive, and contrary to the \naim of encouraging free expression.  \n \nExtract 2a is taken from the second group meeting, and Ann is acting as leader. The discussion is about the \nChristmas party.   \n  \n(2a) Staff: Ann, Residents: Kat, Val, Tim\nANN  What do you think about that, have  774 \na party here on the 22nd, have a disco in the evenings. 775 \nKat umm, (-) [naw 776 \nANN      [So you can all dance with each other 777 \nVal Yes 778 \nKat Na[w 779 \nANN  Ye:s there you are 780 \nTim I would Ann, I would 781 \nANN Valerie likes the idea, Kelly likes the idea  782 \nTim I like it 783 \nANN and Tim likes the idea 784 \nTim Yeah (-)Yeah 785 \nKat discos are 786 \nTim good innit 787 \n(coughing) 788 \nKat I\u2019ll lie upstairs 789 \nTim (At Finedon, we had one) 790 \nANN Well you\u2019ll still hear it up there791 \n \nNote that in line 777 Ann, the staff facilitator, designs her turn as an extension of what she has been \nsaying, in overlap with Kat's just-recognisable rejection of the offer of a party. This  design masks Kat's \nrejection in two ways: it literally masks it aurally (it is difficult to hear) and it masks it interactionally, in \ndesigning the turn as if it was merely an extension of line 774-5, to which there had not yet been an \nanswer. (It is as if Ann had not reached the end of her question, which is now extended to include the \nclause \"so you can all dance with each other\"). \n \nVal answers positively, and in the clear; then on line 779 Kat repeats her \"na:w\" but notice, again, that Ann \ncomes in overlap and ratifies not the rejection but rather Val's acceptance. Now it may be that there are \ndefensible institutional reasons for planning a party (it is culturally a positive event, encouraging \nassociation, recreation, and so on). But we shall see that in pursuing the goal of getting respondents to \nagree to it, the staff member is in danger of offending against another institutional goal, namely free \nexpression of (even negative) opinion.  Following Tim\u2019s agreement at line 781, Ann  names the three \nresidents who like the idea (782-84). However, Kat continues to oppose the idea, stating that she would lie \nupstairs (789).  In response to this, Ann states that Kat would still hear the disco upstairs, which implies \nthat the disco is inevitable with or without Kat\u2019s agreement (791). \n \n(2b) Staff: Ann, Mel, Resident: Lyn\nLyn Ohhh I\u2019m getting too old for it 802 \nANN  You\u2019re getting too old? (-) [You could listen  803 \nto it though couldn\u2019t you? 804 \nKat              [She wouldn\u2019t like it 805 \nLyn [(I don\u2019t want to) 806 \nKat [Too noisy 807 \nMEL You\u2019re never too old to do a  808 \nbit of dirty dan [cing 809 \nLyn         [No I don\u2019t [want to 810 \nANN               [No you can dance,  811 \nANN [I\u2019ll dance with you Lynda. 812 \nMEL [Or Tim can dance813 \n In line 802 above, Lyn also objects to the disco by stating that she is \"getting too old\".  Though she has \nsaid nothing about dancing, Ann suggests this is the reason for her objection and she could instead listen to \nthe music (803-4). Kat supports Lyn by saying she wouldn\u2019t like it and Lyn repeats her objection. Mel \n(another staff member) then suggests, \u2018You\u2019re never too old to do a bit of dirty dancing\u2019 (808-9), which \nLyn again rejects. Notice three things about Mel's intervention. One, just as in the case we saw in Extract \n1, it comes from a member of staff who is not the main mover at this point in the conversation. In that \nsense, Lyn's concerns are being 'relegated' to a secondary player. Secondly, this player is implicitly on one \nside, the side opposed to Lyn's interests - she makes common cause with Ann; Lyn is being faced now not \nonly with the facilitator as a single person, but as someone with allies in the group. Thirdly, notice that \nMel's suggestion (\"You\u2019re never too old to do a bit of dirty dancing\") is clearly 'ironical' or 'jocular'. Lyn \nwould be within her rights to consider that her objections are not being met seriously, with serious \nrebuttals (let alone positive alternatives). Rather, she is being cajoled into changing her mind. One only \ncajoles someone if one does not respect their status or their right to think as they do - a child, say, or \nsomeone petulantly or irrationally hanging on to an idea that is ill-founded. Mel, then, although a case \ncould as before be made that he is pursuing an institutionally appropriate line (of getting someone to do \nsomething \"positive') is offending against an arguably superordinate institutional requirement to respect \nresident's opinions, and their right to make them and keep them. \n \nHowever, Lyn\u2019s opinion is finally rejected by Ann, who contradicts her by saying \u201cNo you can dance, I\u2019ll \ndance with you Lynda,\u201d supported by Mel who suggests Tim might also dance with her. In this way, the \nobjections of Lynda to the disco, which is at odds with the preference of both the staff and three of the \nother residents, is rejected and neutralized by the suggestions of the staff members. This sequence needs to \nbe understood in the context of the dilemma that the meeting face here: the service philosophy of \nrespecting individual choice among the residents is sometimes in conflict with the principles of majority \nrule in making decisions which affect the whole group (and is sometimes in conflict with decisions the \nstaff would like to make for pragmatic reasons). Here however, rather than acknowledge that Lyn\u2019s and \nKat\u2019s preference has been outvoted pure and simple, or pursue alternative activities that all residents agree \nto, their opinions are either ignored or are neutralized by staff suggesting \u2018fixes\u2019 which would allow the \nopinion to be over-ruled.  \n (2c) Staff: Ann, Mel, Residents: Zack, Tim, Lyn, Val\nANN      [Would you dance Zack,  831 \n(-)If [we had a disco 832 \nLyn   [(Za:ck) 833 \nTim  [I would, I\u2019d dance 834 \nZac   Can\u2019t 835 \nANN  You can\u2019t?

Ann repeats his response (836) but counteracts it by saying she could help him.  \nLyn, who was seen opposing the idea above, expresses concern that he may fall (841).  Ann again \nattempts to neutralise this concern, saying she wouldn\u2019t allow him to fall (843).  Mel also fails to take \nZac\u2019s  utterance seriously, suggesting they could put him \u2018on a pair of skates\u2019 (846).  Lyn reiterates her \nconcern (850). After this, both staff members become engaged in conversation with other residents.   \n \nThe discussion tails off and leads into a lengthy one about Father Christmas.  This lasts for approximately \n60 lines, some of which is shown in extract 2d.   \n \n(2d) Staff: Ann, Residents: Val, Kat \nANN and Father Christmas came in 904 \nLyn Oh yeah 905 \nANN Ye:s see she\u2019d almost forgotten hadn\u2019t you?   906 \nWhat did he give you? 907 \nTim At the front door? 908 \nMEL Did you get a present Nat Lynda? 909 \nLyn Yeah 910 \nANN And what did you get?

Following this consensus Ann returns to the Christmas party question and delivers her \nconclusion \u201cSo it\u2019s gonna be a disco at the party then\u201d (929). Although two of the residents have expressed \nstrong disagreement with the idea of the disco, and a further person has said he would be unable to take \npart in the dancing, the decision is finalised. The dissenting voices are either ignored, are joked about, or \ntheir objections are neutralized with \u2018enabling\u2019 suggestions. \n \n2. Producing affirmations of service philosophy \nIn having a duty of care and responsibility to people with learning disabilities, staff may experience a \nconflict when enabling them to make their own decisions.  As mentioned previously, this may arise \nbecause the staff feel they \u2018know better\u2019 than the residents\u2019 (see Rapley and Antaki, 1996).  Alternatively \nthey may have preconceived ideas of what the residents\u2019 answers should be and therefore utilise various \ntechniques to ensure that these responses conform to their expectations. Such patterns are often seen when \nstaff are performing the role of educators, in eliciting the proper procedure to follow in the event of a fire, \nfor example. The extracts below illustrate another context in which such direction takes: in producing a \npublic voicing of the principles the service is supposed to embody.  \n \na. Prompts \nResearchers into the language used by teachers and others who are engaged in imparting information have \noften noted the pervasive use of conversational practices that provide for answers to 'appear \nspontaneously'. These practices range from the provision of candidate answers (Pomerantz, 1988) to the \nuse of pre-sequences which contain information relevant to the answer to an upcoming question (e.g. \nAntaki and Rapley, 1996).  This latter practice is visible in the extract below. In it, Jay, the staff member, \nis finding out if Nat has the sense that she has the right to make choices in her life. In principle, Jay could \nsimply ask this question straight out. But see how he leads up to it (he  delivers it eventually at line 252), \nwith pre-questions which are highly tendentious:  \n \n(3a) Staff: Jay, Residents: Nat \nJAY  Every Monday we go shopping (0.8) isn\u2019t it Natalie? 238 \nNat   Yeah 239 \nJAY  What do we do there? 238 \nNat   Ave coffee 239 \nJAY  What else?  (2.1)[Who buys the coffee for you? 240 \nTim          [getting cold in ere 241 \nNat   You 242 \n(Laughter) 243 \nJAY  and it\u2019s free of charge isn\u2019t it? 244 \nNat   Yeah 245 \nJAY  Yeah.  What else do you do in there Natalie? 246 \nNat   Eh 247 \nJAY  What do you do? (.)We do shopping. 248 \nNat   Yeah 249 \nJAY   And who makes the choices there 250 \nNat   I do 251 \nJAY  Exactly isn\u2019t it, the choice is yours and  252 \nKathy\u2019s so that you can buy whatever you like253 \n \nIn the exchange above Jay asks questions that he appears to know the answer to (242).  As well as using \nnon-neutral questions ending in what Antaki et al (2002) termed \u2018confirmation- expecting tag questions\u2019 \nsuch as \u2018isn\u2019t it\u2019 (246), he also questions Natalie then provides an answer himself (250), clearly \ndemonstrating the route he would like her responses to take.  The questions guide Natalie into expressing \nhow she has freedom of choice when she goes shopping.  A public affirmation of a service principal is \ntherefore produced, and Jay then closes the topic with the appropriate conclusion: \u2018exactly isn\u2019t it, the \nchoice is yours and Kathy\u2019s\u2019 (254-55). \n \nb. Providing candidate answers \nSome of the methods utilised by staff to produce the voicing of particular constructions of the service \ninclude hinting or providing clues, and if these fail then suggesting a response themselves.  All of these \ntechniques are demonstrated in the example below.  The extract shows a discussion relating to the \nfollowing agenda item: \nKey-workers \nYou all have a key-worker \nDo you know what they are? \nDo you know who your key-worker is? \n \nAt the beginning of extract 4, Kathy\u2019s suggestion regarding her perception of her key-worker\u2019s role, \u2018help\u2019, \nthough repeated louder (380), is ignored. Ann\u2019s attention is instead directed towards the nominated \nspeaker, Natalie. When she does not provide an answer, Ann proposes that key-workers are there to \u2018talk \nto\u2019 (381), which Natalie agrees to: \u2018yeah\u2019.  Natalie is then asked to describe her relationship with her care-\nworker (387). Her description \u2018all right\u2019 (388) is then upgraded into \u2018so she\u2019s a friend\u2019 by Ann (394), \nwhich again Natalie agrees to. The other staff member, Mel, then asks about another care worker (398-\n399). Kat says this person is a \u2018helper\u2019 (400), an echo of her earlier ignored suggestion that key-workers \nare there to \u2018help\u2019 (378, 380). Natalie repeats \u2018helper\u2019. Mel then leads her into upgrading this description \nby suggesting another answer might be desirable \u2018yeah, but what do you always say, she is my _?\u2019 When \nNat and Kat then repeat Ann\u2019s earlier suggestion that a staff member is a \u2018friend\u2019 (403-404), Mel receives \nit with a confirmatory \u2018Right\u2019, indicating the correct answer has been provided. Here we see, then, that the \nstaff members use a series of leading questions, provide answers themselves, and ignore or treat as \ninadequate other legitimate answers, until they get to a public voicing of the statement that staff members \nare the residents\u2019 friends. \n \n(4) Staff: Mel, Ann, Residents: Nat, Kat \nANN  What\u2019s your relationship with your care-worker Natalie? 375 \nNat Ees er I dunno 376 \nANN What\u2019s ee there for? 377 \nKat Help 378 \nANN um  379 \nKat HELP 380 \nANN talk to  381 \nNat yeah 382 \nANN and do you go and talk to him? 383 \nNat talk to her 384 \nANN t her 385 \nNat yeah 386 \nMEL What kind of relationship do you have with her, dear? 387 \nNat Alright 388 \nMEL umm? 389 \nNat Sh [e she she\u2019s alright 390 \nTim   [coughs 391 \nMEL She\u2019s alright. 392 \nNat Yeah 393 \nANN so she\u2019s a friend 394 \nNat yeah she\u2019s a [friend 395 \nANN        [yeah 396 \nNat say she\u2019s a friend 397 \nMEL Right, so er the carer, the, night carer who comes on  398 \nthis evening, what is she to you?

One of the main items on the agenda was to allow service \nusers the opportunity to express both dissatisfaction and preferences. It was found, however, that the power \nto acknowledge and act on these rested with the staff.  We found that staff did struggle between conflicting \nrequirements, and, in the extracts we showed, chose ways of proceeding which effectively left residents \nconcerns unrecognized, or shepherded them towards reporting 'positive' experiences. Two main patterns \nwere presented here: \u2018non-uptake\u2019 of legitimate contributions and producing affirmations of service \nphilosophies. \n Concerning the former, staff power was seen in the non-uptake of a complaint voiced repeatedly by a \nresident. This took the form of simply ignoring the complaint by nominating and addressing other \nmembers of the group, and when it was finally acknowledged by reframing the situation being complained \nabout into a positive. The second set of extracts illustrated how the preferences of several residents \nregarding the Christmas party were neutralized through offering fixes.   Although these fixes were not \naccepted by the residents, the decision was taken nevertheless by the staff member who was leading the \ngroup. In this extract the power to determine whose preference was legitimate and what the final decision \nshould be rested solely with the staff members.  The final extracts showed how residents were shepherded \ninto producing particular statements that affirmed service philosophies: that of individual choice and \n\u2018friendly\u2019 relations with the staff (with the implications this has of equality and caring). These statements \nwere produced through the use of leading questions to produce an account from which the principle was \nextracted, or through staff directly providing the answer and then asking questions that led the residents to \nvoice it themselves.  \n \nAlthough space considerations meant that only a limited number of extracts were presented, the transcripts \ncontained other examples which are not reported here. As further evidence that these patterns are not \nisolated instances, similar findings have been reported by Antaki et al (2002) in the context of individual \ninterviews between staff members and service-users. Similarities are also found with the study reported by \nMarkov\u00e1 (1991), who examined verbal interactions between a group of people with learning disabilities \nand a tutor.   \n \nThe aim of this analysis is not to belittle staff members\u2019 attempts to facilitate discussion. We suspect \ndetailed analysis of our own moment-by-moment behaviour would show embarrassing results. Facilitating \ndiscussion among people with differing communicative abilities is not easy, and is made more difficult \nwhen staff are juggling roles of teacher, enabler, representative of the service, and advocate. These roles \nlead to conflicting agendas across many situations. However, this type of analysis is worthwhile in that it \nillustrates the subtle ways the power is exercised in such situations, and therefore might sensitize workers \ntowards their own behaviour and how it facilitates or impedes the autonomy of people with learning \ndisabilities.  \n The White Paper, \u2018Valuing People,\u2019 (Department of Health, 2001) suggested that the lack of control and \nchoice experienced by many people with learning disabilities could be ameliorated by making service \nusers central to the planning process and increasing efforts to communicate with them.  The residents\u2019 \nmeetings were initiated as part of the progression towards these improvements.  However, although staff \nmembers overtly offered opportunities for residents to voice concerns, inadvertently they sought \nendorsement of happiness and satisfaction of the service provided.  Staff controlled the interaction through \nthe use of particular types of questions, through nomination of speakers and through reformulation of the \nresidents\u2019 utterances. The result was that legitimate complaints were sometimes barely acknowledged and \nat other times reformulated towards an opposite point of view.  Relevant to this, French (1994) suggested \nthat the relationship between carer and service user might consist of an imbalance of power due to the \nsense of appreciation the service user is constantly obliged to display.  As a result, expressions of \nsatisfaction are treated with approval and dissatisfaction with disapproval, leading to a situation of \noppression that is difficult to challenge. \n \nExaminations of how staff members treated residents\u2019 expressed preferences suggest that carers face a \nconflict between their roles of promoting individual decision making and their role of providing a duty of \ncare, part of which would include assisting with decision making.  The analysis found that though residents \nwere consistently given opportunities to voice preferences, the choices to be made often appeared to be \npre-ordained.  It was observed that residents were not submissive in raising objections, however these were \nchallenged with rejoinders from staff who used their assumed position of knowing what was better for \nresidents to propel their arguments (see Rapley and Antaki, 1996).  This is reminiscent of Dowson\u2019s \n(1997) discussion of empowerment issues within services, where he noted that empowerment may be \nviewed as something loaned by staff rather than given, for example when service users are allowed to \nmake a decision that meets with the approval of staff.   \n \nThe devices used by care staff to shepherd residents into producing specific answers were consistently \nobserved with certain effects.  These non-neutral practices include the use of yes\/ no questions, which \nusually seek confirmation and therefore are easier to acquiesce to and at the best of times difficult to \ndisagree with (Houtkoop and Steenstra, 2000).  Similarly, care staff were also observed to use devices such \nas clueing which are difficult to resist and help the respondent come up with the desired response.  \nMoreover, residents were seen producing statements which if officially recorded would read for example \nas, \u2018I have choice.\u2019  Such a declaration embodying the mission of the residents\u2019 meetings would \ndemonstrate that progression towards promoting choice and independence in the lives of people with \nlearning disabilities is a success.  However, closer inspection of the discourse would reveal the staff \ncontrol of the interaction by providing their interlocutor with information through a pre-sequence, which \nwould eventually lead to the inevitable statement. \n \nThough the various forms of power identified by the analysis were not inconsequential and were observed \nfrequently in the data, one would hesitate to generalise the findings as an example of what takes place in \nother groups. The verbal behaviour of staff and professionals might be influenced by the type of training \nthey have received. In addition, many self-advocacy groups are run by people with learning disabilities, \nwhere we would expect many of these role conflicts to be absent. However, recognition of the subtle ways \ndisempowerment can occur between people with learning disabilities and their supporters can only further \nthe aims of increasing choice, control and autonomy. \n \nIn summary the rationale behind the resident\u2019s meetings were to empower the client, facilitate group \ninteraction and discuss the issues and concerns of the client.  Though this goes part of the way to meeting \nthe new Government proposals, the analysis exposed ways in which unequal power relations between \nservice users and care staff undermined the objectives the residents\u2019 meetings set out to achieve.  Through \nthe negotiation of conflicting roles as provider of care versus promoter of independence, staff members \nwere seen to tailor their questions and rework service user answers.  The implications of this were that \nanswers, opinions and feelings were constructed, which the respondent did not originally submit. \n \nReferences \nAntaki, C.
