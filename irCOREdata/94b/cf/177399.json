The\nincremental cost effectiveness ratio for hysterectomy\ncompared with second generation ablation is \u00a3970 per\nadditional QALY.\nConclusion In light of the acceptable thresholds used by\nthe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence,\nhysterectomy would be considered the preferred strategy\nfor the treatment of heavymenstrual bleeding. The results\nconcur with those of other studies but are highly sensitive\nto utility values used in the analysis.\nINTRODUCTION\nHeavy menstrual bleeding is a common problem1 that\naffects about 1.5 million women in England and\nWales.2 The condition prompts one in 20 women of\nreproductive age to consult her general practitioner\nand accounts for 20% of all referrals to gynaecology\noutpatients.2 Heavymenstrual bleeding can cause con-\nsiderable distress to women by affecting their perfor-\nmance at work as well as social activities and leads to a\nmeasurable reduction in quality of life.3 Traditionally,\nthe definitive treatment was surgery: in the past, by the\nage of 55 one in five women in the United Kingdom\nhad had a hysterectomy,4 over half of which were for\nheavy menstrual bleeding.5\nFirst line treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding\ninclude oral drug regimens such as tranexamic acid,\nmefenamic acid, and the combined contraceptive pill.\nMore recently an alternative medical option is avail-\nable in the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (Mir-\nena). This intrauterine contraceptive device works to\nreduce menstrual loss by local release of progestogen\nand can be fitted in primary or secondary care.6 Surgi-\ncal treatments include first and second generation\nendometrial ablation, which destroys the lining of the\ncavity of the uterus (endometrium).6 First generation\ntechniques typically required direct hysteroscopic\nvision and include endometrial laser ablation, transcer-\nvical resectionof the endometrium, and rollerball abla-\ntion. Second generation techniques are typically non-\nhysteroscopic, vision control is not required, and they\ntend to be easier to perform. These latter techniques\ninclude fluid filled thermal balloon endometrial abla-\ntion, radiofrequency (thermoregulated) balloon endo-\nmetrial ablation, and microwave endometrial ablation\n(MEA). Hysterectomy, surgical removal of the uterus,\nwas the only surgical solution until the advent of abla-\ntion techniques and is still used when other treatments\nfail.6\nBetween 2000 and 2005 the number of hysterec-\ntomies performed for heavy menstrual bleeding fell\nfrom over 20 000 to just over 7000. Instead, 9701\nwomen underwent endometrial ablation; over half of\nthese (5457) were performed by means of second gen-\neration (non-hysteroscopic) techniques.6 7 The use of\nMirena has increased concurrently, though its\n1Health Economics Unit, School of\nHealth and Population Sciences,\nPublic Health Building, University of\nBirmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT,\nUK\n2Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit,\nUniversity of Birmingham,\nBirmingham\n3Department of Obstetrics and\nGynaecology, Aberdeen Royal\nInfirmary, Foresterhill, Aberdeen\nAB25 2ZN\n4Section of Applied Clinical\nSciences, Division of Applied\nHealth Sciences, School of\nMedicine and Dentistry, University\nof Aberdeen, Aberdeen Maternity\nHospital, Foresterhill, Aberdeen\nCorrespondence to: T E Roberts\nT.E.Roberts@bham.ac.uk\nCite this as: BMJ 2011;342:d2202\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.d2202\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 10\nwidespread use for contraception across many clinical\nsettings in primary and secondary care means that it is\ndifficult to gather accurate data on numbers prescribed\nfor heavymenstrual bleeding. Though some follow-up\nstudies have concentrated on short and medium term\noutcomes after hysterectomy and endometrial abla-\ntion, there have been few long termcontrolled compar-\nisons of hysterectomy with ablation techniques in\nwomen with heavy menstrual bleeding.7\nAs part of a widerNIHRHealth TechnologyAssess-\nment project tasked to assess the existing evidence on\neffectiveness through ameta-analysis of non-oral treat-\nments for heavymenstrual bleeding using data on indi-\nvidual patients,6 we carried out an economic\nevaluation to determine the relative cost effectiveness\nof the four alternative non-oral interventions\u2014hyster-\nectomy, first and second generation endometrial abla-\ntion, and Mirena\u2014for the treatment of heavy\nmenstrual bleeding. Although it is a non-surgical inter-\nvention, we included Mirena in the analysis for com-\nparison primarily because it is the intervention that the\nNational Institute for Health and Clinical (NICE)\nfavours for this condition.8\nMETHODS\nWe have already published a systematic review and\nindividual patient data meta-analysis of available\nevidence.7 Briefly, we used individual patient data as\nfar as possible, supplemented with the trial data as\nnecessary. Individual patient data on 2814 women\nwere available from 17 of the 30 randomised con-\ntrolled trials identified (14 trials (2448 women) for\nfirst versus second generation endometrial ablation;\nseven trials (1127 women) for hysterectomy versus\nfirst generation endometrial ablation; five trials (304\nwomen) for second generation endometrial ablation\nversus Mirena; three trials (190 women) for first gen-\neration endometrial ablation versus Mirena; one trial\n(236 women) for hysterectomy versus Mirena). Direct\nand indirect comparisons were made when appropri-\nate to assess the effect of interventions on the primary\noutcome measure of patient\u2019s dissatisfaction.\nGiven the reliance on secondary data and the nature\nof available data, the model based economic evalua-\ntion takes the form of a cost utility analysis and was\ncarried out from a UK National Health Service\n(NHS) perspective in a secondary care setting.\nCost effectiveness model\nThemodelwas developed through consultationwithin\nthe research team, drawing on the requisite clinical and\nmodelling expertise. We developed a new state transi-\ntion (Markov) model in Microsoft Excel, using as a\nstarting point an existing model developed by Garside\net al.9 In running the model we compared the progress\nof a hypothetical cohort of women with heavy men-\nstrual bleeding when they are treated by four alterna-\ntive interventions: Mirena, first generation\nendometrial ablation techniques, second generation\nendometrial ablation techniques, and hysterectomy.\nWe compared the four alternative interventions in\nfour alternative treatment strategies. The pathway of\nthe strategy is defined by the intervention that is tried\nfirst. For example, the second generation endometrial\nablation strategy is so called because that is the inter-\nvention first in the pathway; if it works for any particu-\nlar woman, her treatment will stop there.However, the\npathways are constructed to follow logical clinical evi-\ndence basedprogression. Each progression in the path-\nway reflects the next likely option, assuming that the\npatient returns seeking further treatment because she is\ndissatisfied with the outcome from the previous treat-\nment. So, for instance, the strategy referred to as sec-\nond generation ablation might also include a repeat\nablation and even a hysterectomy later in the strategy.\nWe include a strategy to represent first generation\nMenorrhagia\nMirena\nSecond\ngeneration\ntechniques\nHysterectomy Well Repeat\nablation (first\ngeneration)\nRepeat\nablation (first\ngeneration)\nHysterectomy Well Hysterectomy Well Well\nWell Well\nFirst generation endometrial\nablation techniques\nSecond generation endometrial\nablation techniques\nHysterectomy\nRepeat\nablation (first\ngeneration)\nHysterectomy Well Hysterectomy Well Hysterectomy Well\nHysterectomy Well\nWell\nFig 1 | Clinical pathways within model for determination of cost effectiveness of different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. Names of strategies denote\nfirst intervention undertaken\nRESEARCH\npage 2 of 10 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nendometrial ablation and a separate strategy to repre-\nsent second generation endometrial ablation.\nAlthough first generation ablation might sound like\nan approach that has been superseded by second gen-\neration ablative techniques, outcomes from first gen-\neration techniques are still acceptable, and the\ntechnique is sometimes considered more versatile\nthan some second generation approaches. For exam-\nple, they are used if visualising the cavity at time of\ntreatment is deemed important. Furthermore, first gen-\neration ablative techniques must be the technique of\nchoice when repeat treatments are required, whether\nor not the preceding treatment was first or second gen-\neration ablation. Neither of the ablative techniques\npreserves fertility. The only intervention that preserves\nfertility isMirena. The hysterectomy strategy is offered\nto a woman for whom the only acceptable outcome is\namenorrhoea. In the hysterectomy strategy, all other\nsteps are bypassed and hysterectomy is the only inter-\nvention.\nFigure 1 shows the clinical pathways on which the\nmodel is based. Health states are shown in boxes, and\narrows show the transitions that can occur. The health\nstates and pathways are the same for both types of\nendometrial ablation techniques. Table 1 presents a\nsummary of the health states for each pathway.\nIn this model, the hypothetical cohort of patients\nmoves between discrete health states to replicate the\nnatural course of the condition, with each state having\nassociated costs and quality of life. In such a model,\ntransition probabilities, costs, and quality of life differ\naccording to the use of the alternative techniques used\nto treat the clinical problem.Thedifference in outcome\nand costs between cohorts yields estimates of cost\neffectiveness.\nWe compared a cohort of 10 000 eligible women for\neach strategy. The starting age of women in the model\nis 42, as this is themean ageofwomen in all the ablation\nrandomised controlled trials, and the period covered is\na total of 10 years.6 7 10 We assume that all women will\nbecomemenopausal at the age of 52, the average age of\nmenopause in the UK. We considered these assump-\ntions to reflect the evidence in the literature.6 These are\nalso the assumptions used by earlier authors.8 Each\nmodel cycle lasts one month, representing the typical\nmenstrual cycle. The death rate from causes other than\nprocedures for heavymenstrual bleedingwas based on\nvalues for women in the government actuary\u2019s\nTable 1 | Definition of health states for women after respective intervention pathways for treatment of heavy menstrual\nbleeding\nEndometrial ablation Hysterectomy Mirena\nMenorrhagia All women in cohort have preoperative heavy menstrual bleeding\nHysterectomy If women have symptoms after first ablation, they\nmight choose to have hysterectomy.

Treat-\nment failure with Mirena is assumed to be more evi-\ndent in the first year.12 13 We also assumed a 2% rate of\ninsertion failure, where the procedure is repeated\nwithin a month.13 If Mirena is unsuccessful, women\nmove to the second generation endometrial ablation\nas indicated by the pathway. No adverse events asso-\nciated with Mirena were available in the literature.6 7\nFor first generation endometrial ablation techniques\nand hysterectomywe used large national audits of both\nas sources for perioperative and severe postoperative\nadverse events (table 2). 14 5 Minor postoperative com-\nplications were not modelled. For second generation\nendometrial ablation techniques, we used complica-\ntion rates of microwave endometrial ablation.15\nSome of the data, specifically proportions in various\nhealth states at points in time after initial treatment,\nrelated to model outputs rather than model inputs.\nWe applied a method that can be called \u201cprobabilistic\ncalibration,\u201d whereby model inputs for the relevant\nparameters were sampled uniformly across the\nplausible range and cost and QALY outcomes were\nweighted according to the likelihood function compar-\ning the model proportions in the various health states\nwith the data.\nA repeated intervention is assumed to indicate a fail-\nure in the initial procedure. The failure rate for endo-\nmetrial ablation is about 25-35%, inferred from the\nnumber of repeat ablations and hysterectomies that\nare carried out. This estimate does not include\nwomen who return to their general practitioner for\nmedical treatment.7 We assumed that if endometrial\nablationof any type fails, repeat ablation (with first gen-\neration devices only) or hysterectomy would be\noffered. In the model it is assumed that 60% of those\nwith recurrent heavy menstrual bleeding (sympto-\nmatic state) will have a repeat endometrial ablation\nand 40% will have a hysterectomy.16 Only one repeat\nablation is offered.We further assumed that if the treat-\nment fails a second time, only hysterectomy is avail-\nable. Complication rates for repeat ablations are\nassumed to be double those incurred for the initial\nablation.17 We assumed that if symptoms do not recur\nwithin two years of the initial ablation, then they are\nunlikely to do so later, and therefore no repeat proce-\ndure takes place thereafter. Thus we have limited the\ntime as towhen a repeat procedure, ablation, or hyster-\nectomy can occur to two years.\nThe transition probability for requiring a repeat pro-\ncedure is time dependent and is reduced by a constant\nfactor each month. This reflects a decreasing hazard,\nwhich is obvious from the individual patient data.7\nWe obtained information on perioperative and\nsevere postoperative adverse events with first genera-\ntion endometrial ablation techniques from the MIS-\nTLETOE study.14 For second generation techniques,\nwe used complication rates with microwave endo-\nmetrial ablation as a proxy15 because the complication\nrates from MISTLETOE for the second generation\ntechniques refer to slightly outdated procedures and\nare no longer relevant. In using the complication\nrates with microwave endometrial ablation from the\nstudy by Parkin et al15 (n=1400), we acknowledge that\nthe true incidence of complications might be underes-\ntimated.

We\nused appropriate indices to inflate some of the costs\nthat were obtained from the literature.18 Table 3\nshows the costs discounted at 3.5% a year (as perNICE\nguidelines).8\nThe source for the costs of adverse events was NHS\n2009 reference costs.19 We used the same cost for peri-\noperative and severe postoperative complications for\neach of the procedures included in the model. The\nvarying severity of complications of the two different\ntypes of endometrial ablations and hysterectomy is\nalso reflected in costs.\nUtility values\nPublished sources were used to identify the quality of\nlife weightings associated with each state in the\nmodel.13 20 21 Table 4 describes these values in detail.\nThe quality of life data show that heavy menstrual\nbleeding is associated with a quality of life value of\n0.50, which means that women who have this condi-\ntion have reported that they feel a loss in terms of qual-\nity of life value that is equivalent to half a year at full\nhealth. If women have a successful first generation\nablation they move to the \u201cwell\u201d state associated with\na quality of life value of 0.73.21 In contrast, after a suc-\ncessful second generation ablation, women move to\nthe \u201cwell\u201d state associated with a quality of life value\nof 0.84. This is an assumption made in the absence of\navailable data, but relates to the same \u201cwell\u201d state as\nafter successful experience with Mirena. This was\nbased on the fact that, if they are successful, second\ngeneration techniques (generally speaking) perform\nbetter, are less invasive, and have fewer adverse\nevents.7 If ablations of any type are unsuccessful and\na repeat ablation is required, however, they are always\nfirst generation ablations and the associated quality of\nlife value is 0.73.\nThe quality of life value for convalescence after hys-\nterectomy is estimated at 0.74.20 22 We assume that this\nquality of life is not reached until one week after hys-\nterectomy and assumed a zero quality of life value for\ntheweek immediately after the operation.This gives an\naverage quality of life over the month of 0.56. After a\nsuccessful hysterectomy, women move to the \u201cwell\u201d\nstate associated with a quality of life value of 0.88.13\nTable 3 | Costs associated with treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding in UK \u00a3 at 2008 prices\nDescription Unit cost Details Source\nFirst generation ablation techniques* \u00a31238 Costs in this study included pre-surgery treatment for endometrial ablations, technical equipment (varied\nfor each method), hospital costs, gynaecological outpatient costs, and re-treatment.

This is necessary to\naccount for the full costs of initial treatment.\nAnalysis\nAll analyses are carried out from the perspective of the\nUKNHS and are reported in terms of incremental cost\neffectiveness ratios presented in terms of cost per qual-\nity adjusted life year (QALY).Dominance in the results\nwill exist if one strategy is found to be both cheaper and\nmore effective in terms of producing more QALYs.\nWe assessed uncertainty in the model parameters\nthrough probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In its most\ncommon form, this assigns to each input parameter a\nspecific distribution and, by drawing randomly from\nthose distributions, generates a large number of esti-\nmates of mean cost and effectiveness. These estimates\nare then used to form an empirical joint distribution of\nthe differences in cost and effectiveness between inter\nventions.23 24\nWe carried out one subgroup analysis and two alter-\nnative one way deterministic sensitivity analyses. The\nsubgroup analysis was carried out on the basis of the\nlength of the uterine cavity, on the rationale that abla-\ntion (as opposed to hysterectomy) is more likely to be\nsuccessful in women with a shorter cavity.7\nIn the first deterministic sensitivity analysis we chan-\nged utilities from the base case, in which the mean uti-\nlity values are used, to an analysis based on reported\nmedian values from the study by Sculpher20 (table 4).\nUse of the mean scores is most appropriate in eco-\nnomic evaluation because if outliers are ignored it\ncould lead to the cost effectiveness analysis underesti-\nmating costs or overestimating effects. Other pub-\nlished studies used median values reported by\nSculpher,20 and notmeans, without explanation or jus-\ntification. We believe this use to be inappropriate and\nare unclear how the medians were estimated.9 In the\nsecond deterministic sensitivity analysis we used the\n\u201cmedian\u201d quality of life values from Sculpher20 and\nset the quality of life value for the \u201cwell\u201d state after\nthe intervention to the same value for both ablation\nstrategies and Mirena (0.90).\nRESULTS\nTable 5 presents a summary of the deterministic\nresults. The results show that the strategy that uses\nfirst generation endometrial ablation as the first inter-\nvention of the pathway is dominated by all the other\nstrategies as it is bothmore expensive and less effective\nin termsof producingQALYs.The strategy that adopts\nhysterectomy as the first and only intervention pro-\nduces the most QALYs. In comparison with the strat-\negy that uses Mirena first, hysterectomy is more\nexpensive but generates moreQALYs. The incremen-\ntal cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) representing the\nvalue of the additional benefit of the hysterectomy\nstrategy compared with Mirena is \u00a31440 (\u20ac1633,\n$2350) per additional QALY. The hysterectomy strat-\negy also produces more QALYs than the second gen-\neration endometrial ablation strategy and the\nestimated incremental cost effectiveness ratio for this\ncomparison is \u00a3970 per additional QALY.\nTable 4 | Health state utilities used in model to determine cost effectiveness of different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding\nUtility\n(SE or 95% CI) Median* Source Comment\nMenorrhagia 0.50 (SE 0.04) 0.55 Sculpher, 199820 \u2014\nDead 0 \u2014 \u2014 By definition\nHysterectomy 0.56 \u2014 \u2014 Assumed 25% less than \u201cconvalescence after hysterectomy\u201d\nWell after hysterectomy 0.88 (0.75 to 0.95)\u2020 \u2014 Hurskainen, 200413 \u2014\nConvalescence after hysterectomy 0.74 (SE 0.05) 0.95 Sculpher, 199820 \u2014\nSevere complications after hysterectomy 0.49 \u2014 Clegg, 200721 \u2014\nFirst generation ablation techniques 0.76 (SE 0.04) 0.85 Sculpher, 199820 Includes \u201cconvalescence after first generation techniques\u201d\nWell after first generation techniques 0.73 (SE 0.04) 0.90 Sculpher, 199820 \u2014\nSevere complications after first generation techniques 0.49 \u2014 \u2014 Same as complications after hysterectomy\nSymptomatic after first generation techniques 0.50 (SE 0.04) 0.55 Sculpher, 199820 Same as \u201cmenorrhagia\u201d\nSecond generation ablation techniques 0.76 (SE 0.04) \u2014 \u2014 Assumed same as first generation techniques\nWell after second generation techniques 0.84 (0.73 to 0.93)\u2020 \u2014 \u2014 Same as Mirena\nSevere complications after second generation techniques 0.49 \u2014 \u2014 Same as complications after hysterectomy\nSymptomatic after second generation techniques 0.50 (SE 0.04) 0.55 Sculpher, 199820 Same as \u201cmenorrhagia\u201d\nRepeat ablation (rollerball) 0.76 (SE 0.04) \u2014 \u2014 Includes convalescence after first generation techniques\nWell after repeat ablation 0.73 (SE 0.04) 0.90 Sculpher, 199820 \u2014\nSevere complications after repeat ablation 0.49 \u2014 \u2014 Same as complications after hysterectomy\nSymptomatic after repeat ablation 0.50 (SE 0.04) 0.55 Sculpher, 199820 Same as \u201cmenorrhagia\u201d\nMirena 0.84 (0.73 to 0.93)\u2020 \u2014 Hurskainen, 200413 Same as \u201cwell after Mirena\u201d assumption\nWell after Mirena 0.84 (0.73 to 0.93)\u2020 \u2014 Hurskainen, 200413 \u2014\nSymptomatic after Mirena 0.50 (SE 0.04) \u2014 Sculpher, 199820 Same as \u201cmenorrhagia\u201d\n*Median values used in two one-way sensitivity analyses.\n\u2020Mean and width of confidence intervals fitted.\nRESEARCH\npage 6 of 10 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nThe Mirena strategy dominates the first generation\nendometrial ablation strategy, being cheaper andmore\neffective in producing QALYs. But though it is also\ncheaper than second generation endometrial ablation,\nin this comparison it produces fewer QALYs. The\nincremental cost effectiveness ratio for the second gen-\neration endometrial ablation versus Mirena is \u00a32980\nper additional QALY.\nFigure 2 shows the result of the probabilistic sensitiv-\nity analysis. Detailed interpretation of this analysis and\nadditional value of information analysis is presented\nelsewhere.6 Briefly, it shows the probability that the\npreferred option is cost effective for any given thresh-\nold incremental cost effectiveness ratio for all but a few\nreplications\u2014and the few account for a negligible\nprobability. Mirena was the least costly option and,\nfor low acceptable threshold incremental cost effec-\ntiveness ratios, Mirena is preferred with certainty\nwithin this model given its assumptions. But as the\nthreshold incremental cost effectiveness ratio increases\nhysterectomy becomes the preferred option.\nIn some replications of the model (accounting for\n20% of the probability), hysterectomy was not the\nmost effective option (in terms of total number of\nQALYs). At an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of\n\u00a31440, the preferred option changes from Mirena to\nhysterectomy, so there is a discontinuity in the cost\neffectiveness acceptability curve.\nIn the subgroup analysis, carried out to explore the\nimpact of the length of the uterine cavity on cost effec-\ntiveness of the alternative interventions for heavymen-\nstrual bleeding, we carried out two separate analyses\nand a corresponding probabilistic sensitivity analysis.\nThe results of the subgroup analysis showed a small\neffect of shorter and longer uterine cavity length,\nwhich was in the same direction for both. For both\ncases the results moved slightly so that first generation\nablation was no longer \u201cdominated\u201d by hysterectomy\nand the incremental cost per additional QALY of hys-\nterectomy compared with other strategies was slightly\nhigher (less favourable) than in the base case. There is,\nhowever, unlikely to be a change in the decision based\non these results and hysterectomy remains the pre-\nferred strategy. The results of the probabilistic sensitiv-\nity analysis reinforced the results of this deterministic\nsubgroup analysis and are not presented.\nIn a further deterministic sensitivity analysis, we\nchanged the utilities from the base case in which the\nmean utility values are used, to reported median\nvalues. In the first deterministic sensitivity analysis\nwe used the \u201cmedian\u201d quality of life values from\nSculpher20 and assumed the quality of life scores as a\nresult of first and second generation ablation were\nequal based onmedian values (well after first or second\ngeneration endometrial ablation 0.90). The key change\nin results compared with the base case is that there is a\nclear shift away from the hysterectomy strategy in\nfavour of second generation endometrial ablation.\nThis dominates first generation endometrial ablation\nas before, but now also dominates hysterectomy.\nMeanwhile, in this sensitivity analysis the incremental\ncost effectiveness ratio for second generation endo-\nmetrial ablation versus the Mirena strategy was\n\u00a31000 per additional QALY.\nThe results of the second deterministic sensitivity\nanalysis are similar to those presented in the first.\nOnce again the strategy of second generation endo-\nmetrial ablation dominates first generation endo-\nmetrial ablation and hysterectomy, in contrast with\nthe base case. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio\nfor second generation endometrial ablation versus\nMirena is \u00a33624 per additional QALY.\nFigures 3 and 4 summarise and compare the key\nfindings from changing the utility values (presented\nin the first and second sensitivity analyses) with the\nbase case. Figure 3 shows that with baseline (mean)\nutilities, Mirena is the least costly strategy and hyster-\nectomy the most effective. The strategy that starts with\nfirst generation endometrial ablation is simply domi-\nnated by all of the other strategies. The strategy that\nstarts with second generation endometrial ablation is\nexcluded by extended dominance between Mirena\nand hysterectomy.\nFigure 4 shows the same costs for all strategies as\nfigure 3 but the total QALYs are increased. By using\nthe median utility values, second generation ablation\nnow becomes the most effective strategy: both first\nTable 5 | Summary of deterministic base case, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses of model to\ndetermine cost effectiveness of different treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding\nTotal costs per\nstrategy (\u00a31000)\nTotal QALYs\nper strategy\nIncremental cost\neffectiveness\nratio (ICER)\n(v hysterectomy)\nSummary of base case deterministic results\nFirst generation endometrial ablation 23 590 63 745 Dominated\nSecond generation endometrial ablation 19 470 69 678 970\nMirena 16 150 68 566 1440\nHysterectomy 23 000 73 332 \u2014\nSummary of subgroup analysis based on short uterine cavity length\nFirst generation endometrial ablation 21 356 63 143 161\nSecond generation endometrial ablation 19 264 69 582 996\nMirena 15 667 68 201 1429\nHysterectomy 23 000 73 332 \u2014\nSummary of subgroup analysis based on long uterine cavity length\nFirst generation endometrial ablation 20 104 62 809 275\nSecond generation endometrial ablation 17 986 69 655 1364\nMirena 15 158 68 558 1642\nHysterectomy 23 000 73 332 \u2014\nDeterministic sensitivity analysis 1: where mean values are substituted by median values*\nFirst generation endometrial ablation 23 588 74 218 2225\nSecond generation endometrial ablation 19 466 74 402 Dominates\nMirena 16 151 71 089 2391\nHysterectomy 23 000 73 954 \u2014\nDeterministic sensitivity analysis 2: where mean values are substituted by median values\u2020\nFirst generation endometrial ablation 23 588 74 218 2225\nSecond generation endometrial ablation 19 466 74 402 Dominates\nMirena 16 151 73 488 14 683\nHysterectomy 23 000 73 954 \u2014\n*Assumes that well after intervention for first and second generation ablation are equal but not for Mirena.\n\u2020Assumes that well post intervention is same for both ablation strategies and Mirena.\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 7 of 10\ngeneration endometrial ablation and hysterectomy are\nsimply dominated by second generation endometrial\nablation.\nDISCUSSION\nStatement of principal findings\nThe results of the base case analysis show that hyster-\nectomy is the preferred strategy as the first intervention\nfor heavy menstrual bleeding. Hysterectomy domi-\nnates the strategy that uses first generation endometrial\nablation as the initial intervention. Although hysterect-\nomy ismore expensive, it producesmoreQALYs rela-\ntive to other remaining strategies and is likely to be\nconsidered cost effective: the incremental cost effec-\ntiveness ratio for hysterectomy compared withMirena\nis \u00a31440 per additional QALY. These results suggest\nthat hysterectomy first would be considered the pre-\nferred strategy in light of the acceptable thresholds\nused byNICE,which tends to accept new technologies\nif the incremental cost effectiveness ratio is within\n\u00a320 000 per additional QALY.\nOur main results suggesting the relative cost effec-\ntiveness of hysterectomywere robust to all the sensitiv-\nity and subgroup analyses, with the exception of the\nsensitivity analysis carried out on the utility data. This\nwas based on an analysis that used the reported values\nof utilities that are available in the published literature,\nspecifically the \u201cmean\u201d\u2019 reported utility values, which\nis appropriate.25 26\nStrengths and limitations\nThemajor strength of the economic component of this\nstudy is that it is based on a sophisticated Markov\nmodel, whichwas informed by data from an individual\npatient level datameta-analysis of randomised trials. A\nmultidisciplinary team including economists, expert\nclinicians, and statisticians provided input into the\nmodel structure primarily based on the evidence in\nthe literature. All assumptions used in the model\nwere based on the available evidence as far as possible.\nAll required assumptions were agreed with the team\nbefore the analysis was carried out and without knowl-\nedge of how these assumptionsmight affect the results.\nIn terms of limitations, it is possible that we did not\ninclude all aspects of costs and outcome as the utilities\nused are likely to reflect the satisfaction of the out-\ncomes only. Once women have had a hysterectomy,\nfor example, their satisfaction is high because, in con-\ntrast with the other interventions, they experience no\nbleeding at all. But the utilitymeasure does not capture\nthe anxiety before hysterectomy associatedwithmajor\nsurgery and general anaesthetic. Such anxieties can\nlead to decisions that avoid major surgery as a first\nstep and to try other less invasive options for as long\nas possible. The perspective of the analysis does not\ninclude the costs to women associated with six to\neight weeks\u2019 convalescence after hysterectomy.\nFurthermore, the model\u2019s time horizon and the lack\nof long term data exclude possible effects of long\nterm complications such as urinary stress incontinence\nfor which surgery is required.27\nStrengths, weaknesses, and assumptions in relation to\nother studies\nWith regard to the utility values that have been used in\nthe current study the followingpoints areworth noting.\nFirst, the paper by Sculpher20 has been extensively\nreferenced in the literature. Other studies, including\nthat by Garside et al,9 have used the median values\nfrom that paper and not the means, seemingly without\njustification or a critique of the face validity of these\ndata. Furthermore, for economic evaluation it is the\nmean values that are most appropriate to use as it is\nconsidered important to capture outliers to avoid\nunderestimating costs or overestimating benefits.25 26\nOur results suggest that hysterectomy is the most\ncost effective strategy, but we must emphasise the\nuncertainty in the utility data. Mirena has not been\nextensively evaluated, and there are only limited data\navailable on long term follow-up.7\nComparison with other studies\nThe results of the model based economic evaluation\nreported by Garside et al also showed hysterectomy\nwas the most cost effective strategy for treating heavy\nmenstrual bleeding.9 They compared second genera-\ntion with first generation ablative techniques and hys-\nterectomy. Mirena was not included in their\ncomparative analysis.When compared with hysterect-\nomy, second generation ablative techniques were\nfound to be less costly but also provided fewer\nQALYs. The authors used median, not mean, utility\nvalues in their analysis but without justification. They\nreported that the results of their model were highly\nsensitive to the utility values associated with being\nwell after ablation and recommended that results are\ninterpreted with caution because of this sensitivity.9 In\nour sensitivity analysis, whenweused the samemedian\nvalue for the utilities, as opposed to the means, the\nresults showed that second generation endometrial\nablation was the most cost effective strategy.\nOur results do not concur with the result of the Fin-\nnish trial byHurskainen et al, which comparedMirena\nwith hysterectomy and found Mirena to be cost\nTotal QALYs (000s)\nTo\nta\nl c\nos\nt (\n\u00a3m\n)\n60 65 70 75\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nNot dominated\nMirena\nHysterectomy\nSecond generation\nFirst generation\nFig 4 | Deterministic sensitivity analysis with median utility\nvalues instead of means for cost effectiveness of different\ntreatments for heavy menstrual bleeding (Mirena,\nhysterectomy, and first and second generation ablation\ntechniques)\nRESEARCH\npage 8 of 10 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\neffective at five years.13 There was no significant differ-\nence in quality of life scores at five years, as measured\nby the EQ-5D instrument, between the two treatment\ngroups. But this is unsurprising as 40%ofwomen in the\nMirena arm went on to have a hysterectomy and com-\npleted EQ-5D at the end of treatment.13 It is also a\ncause for concern that mean direct costs in the Mirena\narm remained significantly lower ($1892) than the hys-\nterectomy arm ($2787), despite the substantial number\nsubsequently undergoing hysterectomy.\nAn economicmodelling study undertaken to inform\nNICE guidelines8 suggested that Mirena is cost effec-\ntive when comparedwith both hormonal and non-hor-\nmonal treatment. Mirena generated more QALYs at a\nlower cost than any othermedical or surgical treatment\nstrategy considered. Our model differed from the\nNICE model in terms of the assumptions. The NICE\nmodel assumed that within the five year lifespan of\nMirena, some women who experienced failure with\nMirena would move straight to hysterectomy (based\non data from Hurskainen et al13). In contrast, in our\nstudy, our assumption (based on advice from clinical\ncolleagues) was that all women who experienced fail-\nure with the Mirena strategy would, in the first\ninstance, follow the second generation endometrial\nablation pathway. This helps to explain the difference\nin results and the relative preference in our analysis for\nhysterectomy over Mirena. Furthermore, it also high-\nlights the importance of hysterectomy, as integral to\nNICE guidance supportingMirena in the first instance\nis the belief that hysterectomy is available if Mirena\nfails.\nAn implicit assumption in this and other similar stu-\ndies is that there exists equivalent ability to undertake\nall these procedures both froma time and skill base, but\nthis is unlikely to be true. For example, Mirena can be\nfitted in primary care; second generation ablative tech-\nniques, while requiring use of a hospital, can be carried\nout by specialist after minimal training in an outpatient\nsetting; but hysterectomy can be undertaken only by\nmore highly trained specialists in inpatient theatre\nsuites. While these differences are reflected in the\ncosts of the procedures used in the analyses, constraints\nin available capacity and skills are not.\nImplications\nOur results suggest that, based on current best avail-\nable data, which are limited, Mirena is not a robust\ncost effective strategy compared with hysterectomy.\nThese results contradict current opinion and practice\nin gynaecology, which has seen a reduction in the rate\nof hysterectomy for heavymenstrual bleeding over the\npast decade or so. Our evaluation is based on the best\navailable data and the assumptions used in the model\nwere made before the analysis and are unbiased. The\ndata, however, might not reflect the decision making\nprocess between women and doctors for whom mini-\nmal risks and relatively quick and convenient treat-\nments might offset the higher failure rates associated\nwith Mirena initially, knowing that a more definitive\ntreatment is still available. This leads to a potential con-\nflict between an individual approach based on choice\nand a utilitarian one based on maximising gains for\nsociety.\nUnanswered questions for future research\nWe used a sophisticated model, data from an indivi-\ndual patient data meta-analysis, and all available data\non quality of life associated with the available inter-\nventions for the outcomes for alternative treatments\nfor heavy menstrual bleeding.\nOne of the main causes of uncertainty is with regard\nto the utility values associated with alternative inter-\nventions and their success. There would be little\nvalue in future studies comparing the outcomes and\ncosts of any alternative interventions to treat women\nfor heavy menstrual bleeding without undertaking a\ncomprehensive study to clarify the quality of life asso-\nciated with the outcomes of the alternative inter-\nventions.\nOur results show that more robust clinical data\nwould enhance clinical decision making, in particular\nwith regard to interventions such as Mirena, for which\nthere are limited follow-up data. Some of the current\nauthors are involved in the Birmingham based\nECLIPSE trial, which is a large UK funded\n(NCCHTA) trial that will provide evidence on\nwhether Mirena is preferable to standard oral treat-\nments for heavy menstrual bleeding. Several\napproaches to assessing quality of life issues and pre-\nferences are currently being considered.\nPreferences of women and clinicians will continue to\nbe extremely influential in decision making. Many\nclinicians believe that a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to\nthe treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding is impossi-\nble. As individual choices can determine perceived\nsuccess, eliciting preferences is also extremely relevant\nin this context.28\nContributors: TER, PB, SB, and JD contributed to the design of the whole\nproject and obtained funding.
