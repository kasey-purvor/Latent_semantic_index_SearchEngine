This family of models is explored\nanalytically in some detail \u2013 the distribution functions, the intrinsic moments and the\nprojected moments are all calculated.\nFor the nearby Galactic dSphs, samples of hundreds of discrete radial velocities are\nbecoming available. A technique is developed to extract the anisotropy and dark matter\ncontent from such data sets by maximizing the likelihood function of the sample of radial\nvelocities. This is constructed from the distribution function and corrected for observational\nerrors and the effects of binaries. Tests on simulated data sets show that samples of ,1000\ndiscrete radial velocities are ample to break the degeneracy between mass and anisotropy in\nthe nearby dSphs. Interesting constraints can already be placed on the distribution of the dark\nmatter with samples of ,160 radial velocities (the size of the present-day data set for Draco).\nThe Space Interferometry Mission or SIM allows very accurate differential astrometry at\nfaint magnitudes. This can be used to measure the internal proper motions of stars in the\nnearby Galactic dSphs. Our simulations show that ,100 proper motions are sufficient to\ndemolish the mass\u2013anisotropy degeneracy completely. The target stars in Draco are at\nmagnitudes of V , 19\u201320 and the required proper motion accuracy is 3\u20136mas yr21. The\nmeasurement of the proper motions of a sample of ,100 stars uncontaminated with binaries\nwill take about 400 h of SIM time, or under 2 per cent of the mission lifetime.\nKey words: stellar dynamics \u2013 galaxies: individual: Draco \u2013 galaxies: individual: Sculptor \u2013\ngalaxies: kinematics and dynamics \u2013 Local Group \u2013 dark matter.\n1 I N T R O D U C T I O N\nThe dark matter content of low-luminosity dwarf galaxies, as\ninferred from analyses of their internal stellar and gas kinematics,\nmakes them the most dark matter dominated of all galaxies\n(Carignan & Beaulieu 1989; Mateo 1998). Of these small galaxies,\nthe low-luminosity gas-free dwarf spheroidals (dSph) are the most\nextreme. Available stellar kinematic studies provide strong\nevidence for the presence of dominant dark matter (e.g. Aaronson\n1983; Mateo 1998), confirming speculations based on estimates of\nthe dSph\u2019s tidal radii (Faber & Lin 1983). Although there have\nbeen alternative suggestions as to the origin of the large mass-to-\nlight ratios of the dSphs (e.g. Kuhn & Miller 1989; Kroupa 1997),\nnone of these has carried much conviction \u2013 see, for example, the\nobjections raised by Sellwood & Pryor (1997) and Mateo (1997).\nThe spatial distribution of the dark matter in the dSphs is very\npoorly known. Three obvious possibilities suggest themselves.\nFirst, the dark matter may shadow the stars and so the mass\ndistribution may follow the light. Secondly, the dark matter may be\ndistributed in a halo which generates a flat rotation curve, as is the\ncase for galaxies like the Milky Way or M31. Thirdly, the\nscalelength of the dark matter may be larger than the luminous\nmatter and so the dSph may lie in the harmonic core of an extended\ndark matter halo. One promising way to distinguish between these\nis by dynamical modelling.\nAmongst the nearest dSphs are Draco and Sculptor, at\nheliocentric distances of 82 and 79 kpc, respectively. Both are\nPE-mail: markw@ast.cam.ac.uk (MIW); kleyna@ast.cam.ac.uk (JK);\nw.evans1@physics.ox.ac.uk (NWE); gil@ast.cam.ac.uk (GG)\nMon. Not. R. Astron.

The Draco dSph has\nan inferred central mass-to-light ratio of ,60 in solar V-band units,\nwhereas Sculptor has a less extreme value of ,10 (Mateo 1998).\nAny robust dynamical analysis is eased if the potential is\napproximately steady-state, and if the tracer stellar distribution is\nin equilibrium and well-mixed. The internal crossing times of the\ndSphs are typically only\ntcross , R\/s , 2 \u00a3 107\u0085R\/200 pc\u0086\u008510 km s21\/s\u0086 yr: \u00851\u0086\nThe Draco dSph is dominated by an intermediate-age to old stellar\npopulation, but with little star formation for the last ,5 Gyr\n(Hernandez, Gilmore & Valls-Gabaud 2000). Deep Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) imaging of a small field in the outer regions of the\nSculptor dSph has revealed a stellar population that is old and\nmetal-poor, similar to halo globular clusters, with little spread in\nage (Monkiewicz et al. 1999) or metallicity (Mateo 1998). Thus,\nstar formation indeed ceased many crossing times ago and both\nthese systems should be well-mixed. Radial velocity surveys are\navailable for both Draco (Hargreaves et al. 1996; Armandroff,\nOlszewski & Pryor 1995) and Sculptor (Queloz, Dubath &\nPasquini 1995). Sculptor is of particular current interest due to the\ndetection of significant amounts of H I gas projected within its tidal\nradius, at a consistent velocity to be truly associated with the dSph\n(Carignan et al. 1998).\nThe aim of this paper is to provide new models for the dSphs and\nnew techniques for probing the dark matter distribution. Section 2\ndescribes our models and their intrinsic properties, while Section 3\npresents the observable properties, including the distributions of\nradial velocities. In Section 4, Monte Carlo simulations are used to\nassess how radial velocity surveys and proper motions inferred\nfrom astrometric satellites discriminate between different dark\nmatter distributions. There are already samples of over a hundred\nradial velocities available for Draco, and this will rise to several\nhundreds in the next few years. The Space Interferometry Mission\n(SIM, see http:\/\/sim.jpl.nasa.gov\/) has the capabilities to measure\nthe internal proper motions of stars in Draco. We assess the likely\nimpact of the new data sets and devise strategies for exploiting\nthem. Finally, a companion paper in this issue of Monthly Notices\npresents an application of the models and algorithm to a newly\nacquired data set for Draco (Kleyna et al. 2002, hereafter Paper II).\n2 DWA R F S P H E R O I DA L M O D E L S\n2.1 Potential and density\nIn the past, dSphs have often been fitted using isotropic, spherical,\nsingle-component King (1962) models (e.g. Hodge 1966). These\nare flexible and convenient, but they do come at the cost of very\nstrong assumptions \u2013 namely that mass follows light and that all\nthe stars have a lowered Maxwellian distribution of velocities out\nto the tidal radius. Anisotropic King models relax the latter\nassumption, but still assume that the distributions of mass and light\nare identical. The removal of the mass-follows-light constraint\nthrough the representation of the dark matter and stars as two\ncomponents of a multimass King model is not physically\nappropriate as such models assume energy equipartition among\nthe different mass classes, which is certainly not the case in a\ncollisionless system such as a dSph. Noting this caveat, Pryor &\nKormendy (1990) applied such models to data on the light\ndistribution and central velocity dispersions of Draco and Ursa\nMinor. They found that models in which the luminous and dark\nmatter had similar distributions were favoured over models with\nmore extended dark matter distributions. However, the assumed\ncoupling between the dark and luminous matter means that\nchanging the velocity anisotropy of these models affects the\ndistribution of the luminous matter. In this paper, instead, we build\na family of self-consistent distribution functions for the stars in a\ndSph, where we assume that the stars are a tracer moving in the\nunderlying population matter potential of the dark and luminous\nmatter. This allows us to probe the mass\u2013anisotropy degeneracy.\nPlummer\u2019s (1911) model was originally developed to fit the light\ndistribution of the globular clusters, but a much better application\nis to fit the light distribution of the dSphs (Lake 1990). For\nexample, Fig. 1 shows the best fitting Plummer profile as compared\nFigure 1. This shows the projected density of the best-fitting Plummer\nmodel for Draco (upper panel) and Sculptor (lower panel). The data are the\nbackground-subtracted star-count major axis profiles given by Irwin &\nHatzidimitriou (1995). \u0085r0 \u0088 9:71 arcmin for Draco and 13.64 arcmin for\nSculptor.)\nDwarf spheroidals \u2013 I.

With the exception of the Sagittarius and Ursa Minor dSphs,\nall the remaining seven Galactic dSphs are roughly spherical, with\nellipticities lying between 0.13 (Leo II) and 0.35 (Sextans). So, the\nassumption of spherical symmetry is reasonable. We envisage our\nmodels as being particularly useful for Draco and Sculptor, because\nthey are nearby and a wealth of kinematical data is either already\navailable or will become so over the next few years.\nAccordingly, let us take the luminosity density of the dSph as\nr\u0085r\u0086 \u0088 r0\u00891\u0087 \u0085r\/r0\u00862\u008a5=2\n; \u00852\u0086\nwhere r0 is determined by the total observed luminosity. The\nsurface brightness of the dSph is\nS\u0085R\u0086 \u0088 4\n3\nr0r0\n\u00891\u0087 \u0085R\/r0\u00862\u008a2\n; \u00853\u0086\nwhere R is the projected radius. The physical meaning of r0 is that\nit is the radius of the cylinder that contains half the light;\nhenceforth r0 is set to unity.\nOur aims are to assess the severity of the degeneracy between\nvelocity anisotropy and mass in the dSphs and to investigate what\nradial velocity surveys may teach us. We need a flexible family of\ndSph models with differing dark matter distributions and velocity\nanisotropies, but fitting the same star-count profiles on the sky. So,\nwe assume that the potential of the system has the form\nc\u0085r\u0086 \u0088\nc0\n\u00891\u0087 r 2\u008aa\/2 if a \u2013 0;\n2\nv20\n2\nlog\u00891\u0087 r 2\u008a if a \u0088 0;\n8>><>>: \u00854\u0086\nwhere 22 < a < 1. Setting c0 \u0088 v20\/a, the circular velocity curve\nis\nv2circ \u0088 v20\nr 2\n\u00891\u0087 r 2\u008a1\u0087a\/2 : \u00855\u0086\nIn other words, the circular velocity curve falls off asymptotically\nlike r 2a\/2. This dark matter potential nicely spans the range of dark\nmatter density distributions which we wish to probe: a \u0088 1\ncorresponds to a mass-follows-light Plummer potential and a\nKeplerian fall-off at large radii; a \u0088 0 yields an asymptotically flat\nrotation curve; and a \u0088 22 gives a harmonic oscillator potential\ncorresponding to the central regions of an extended dark-matter\nhalo. Note that, as the parameter a decreases, the dSph becomes\nincreasingly dark matter dominated.\nFig. 2 shows the variation of the central and average mass-to-\nlight ratio as a function of the model parameters a (which controls\nthe amount of dark matter present) and n (which measures the\nanisotropy of the velocity distribution \u2013 see Section 2.3). It is\nimportant to bear in mind that these mass-to-light ratios correspond\nto models with the same star-count density and the same central\nvelocity dispersion. The figure provides a telling indication of the\nseverity of the degeneracy between anisotropy and mass, because\nthe mass-to-light ratio varies by an order of magnitude as we scan\nthe models. It is this degeneracy we wish to break with kinematic\nmeasurements.\n2.2 Distribution functions\nWe now build the distributions of velocities that supports the dSph\nstellar density (2) in the dark matter potential (4). As is well known,\nonce the velocity distribution is permitted to be anisotropic, there\nare many possible ways of building a given density from stellar\norbits (see Binney & Tremaine 1987, ch. 4). The even part of the\ndistribution function (DF) is determined by the stellar density law,\nthe odd part by the stellar streaming or rotation law. There is no\nevidence for rotation in the Draco or Sculptor dSphs, so we\ncalculate only the even part of the DF.\n2.2.1 Isotropic DFs\nAccording to Jeans\u2019 (1915) theorem, the DF of the stars in a\npotential is a function entirely of the isolating integrals of motion.\nIsotropic models have DFs that depend only on the binding energy\nE. The isotropic DFs are found from Eddington\u2019s (1916) inversion\nformula as:\nF\u0085E\u0086 \u0088\nCa;0jEj5\/a23=2 if a \u2013 0;\nC0;0 exp\u00855E\/v20\u0086 if a \u0088 0;\n8<: \u00856\u0086\nwhere the numerical constants Ca,0 are given in Table 1. These are\nvery simple results \u2013 compare, for example, the much more\ncomplicated isotropic DFs of the spherical isochrone (written out\nin Binney & Tremaine 1987) or the Hernquist (1990) sphere. The\nonly other spherical models with comparably simple DFs are the\npower-law spheres (Evans 1993, 1994).\n2.2.2 Anisotropic DFs: a . 0\nAnisotropic DFs of spherical models depend on both the energy E\nand the norm of the angular momentum L. The DFs contain an\nadditional parameter g, which we shall see shortly controls the\nanisotropy. We begin by writing the Plummer density (2) in terms\nof the spherical polar radius r and the potential c(r). There are\nFigure 2. Variation of mass-to-light ratio (in units of M(\/L() as a function\nof a for three different n values. The parameter n measures the anisotropy of\nthe velocity distribution. Models with n \u0088 0 are everywhere isotropic,\nwhile models with positive (negative) n become increasingly radial\n(tangential) at large radii (see Section 2.3 for discussion).

Numerical evaluation of the\nhypergeometric function can be difficult. In fact, none of the\nalgorithms for evaluating the hypergeometric function 2F1(a, b, c; z)\npresented in the standard reference books on numerical methods\n(e.g. Press et al. 1992) is applicable for all values of the parameters\na,b and c. This is because very different strategies are required\ndepending on the magnitude and signs of the parameters. Our\ncomputational algorithm is presented in Appendix B. Note that in\nour applications to calculations of the likelihoods in Section 4, it is\nimportant that the DFs are calculated extremely accurately. The\nobvious way of checking our numerical algorithm is to investigate\nwhether the integration of the DF over velocity space yields the\nPlummer density. Typically, we find that the density is recovered to\nbetter than one part in 106.\n2.3 Intrinsic moments\nAlthough the DFs (8), (13) and (18) have differing forms according\nto whether the rotation curve is falling \u0085a . 0\u0086, flat \u0085a \u0088 0\u0086 or\nrising \u0085a , 0\u0086, none the less all physical quantities like the\nmoments vary smoothly and continuously with the rotation curve\nindex a.\nThe intrinsic velocity second moments are\nkv2r l \u0088\nv20\n\u0085a\u0087 5 2 g\u0086\n1\n\u00851\u0087 r 2\u0086a\/2 ; \u008521\u0086\nkv2ul \u0088 kv2fl \u0088\nv20\n\u0085a\u0087 5 2 g\u0086\n1\n\u00851\u0087 r 2\u0086a\/2 1 2\ng\n2\nr 2\n1\u0087 r 2\n\u0014 \u0015\n: \u008522\u0086\nThe second moments converge and are positive definite provided\ng , min\u0085a\u0087 5; 2\u0086.\nIn terms of Binney\u2019s (1981) anisotropy parameter b, the radial\nand tangential velocity dispersion kv2r l and kv\n2\nul vary as\nb \u0088 1 2 kv\n2\nul\nkv2r l\n\u0088 g\n2\nr 2\n1\u0087 r 2 : \u008523\u0086\nIf g \u0088 0, the velocity dispersions are isotropic. Irrespective of g,\nthe central regions of the model are always isotropic. At large radii,\nthe anisotropy becomes constant (cf., He\u00b4non 1973; Wilkinson &\nEvans 1999). If g , 0, then the dispersion tensor becomes\ntangential with increasing radius; if g . 0, it becomes radial. The\nlimit g ! 21 is the circular orbit model, while the limit g ! 2 is\nbuilt from radial orbits alone in the outer parts.\nIt is also helpful to define the quantity n which is related to g by\nn \u0088 log10 2\n2 2 g\n\u0012 \u0013\nThis quantity runs from 21 (tangential velocity distribution at\nlarge radii) to \u00871 (radial velocity distribution at large radii). The\nvelocity distribution is everywhere isotropic for n \u0088 0. This\ndefinition is helpful because the ranges of tangential and radial\nanisotropy are symmetric about n \u0088 0.\nThe intrinsic fourth moments are useful for diagnosing\ndeviations from pure Gaussianity and so we briefly list the results\nhere:\nkv4r l \u0088\nv40\n\u0085a\u0087 5 2 g\u0086\u00852a\u0087 5 2 g\u0086\n1\n\u00851\u0087 r 2\u0086a ; \u008524\u0086\nkv2r v\n2\nul \u0088 kv2r v2fl\n\u0088 v\n4\n0\n\u0085a\u0087 5 2 g\u0086\u00852a\u0087 5 2 g\u0086\n1\n\u00851\u0087 r 2\u0086a\n\u00a3 1 2 g\n2\nr 2\n1\u0087 r 2\n\u0014 \u0015\n; \u008525\u0086\nkv4ul \u0088 kv4fl\n\u0088 v\n4\n0\n8\u0085a\u0087 5 2 g\u0086\u00852a\u0087 5 2 g\u0086\n1\n\u00851\u0087 r 2\u0086a\n\u00a3 \u00854 2 g\u0086\u00852 2 g\u0086 \u0087 2g\u00852 2 g\u0086\n1\u0087 r 2 \u0087\ng\u00852\u0087 g\u0086\n\u00851\u0087 r 2\u00862\n\u0014 \u0015\n: \u008526\u0086\nAll the remaining components of this fourth-rank tensor vanish.\nThe fourth moments converge and are positive definite provided\ng , min\u00852a\u0087 5; 2\u0086.\n3 O B S E RVA B L E P R O P E RT I E S\nThe properties of dSphs when viewed in projection are of particular\ninterest to us, as these correspond to observable quantities.

Conversely,\ntangentially anisotropic dSphs \u0085g; n , 0\u0086 have more projected\nvelocity dispersion sP at large radii than isotropic dSphs, and less\nsP at small radii.

Hence, it is also useful to calculate the one-dimensional\ndistributions of proper motions L(vR, R) or L(vw, R) by integrating\nalong the line of sight and over the other two transverse velocities.\nFigs 4 and 5 present some examples of line profiles and proper\nmotion distributions obtained for a variety of values of R, a and g.\nThese are calculated by direct integration over the DFs. For the\nisotropic models \u0085g; n \u0088 0\u0086, the line profile and the proper motion\ndistributions clearly coincide. Tangentially anisotropic clusters\ntend to show bimodal line profiles, whereas radially anisotropic\nclusters tend to have narrower, peaked line profiles. Hence, the\ntrend as we move vertically downwards in the panels is towards\nbroader and more flat-topped profiles. The larger the dark matter\ncontent, the greater and more distended the wings of the line\nprofiles. So, the trend as we move from left to right in the panels is\ntowards less-extended line profiles.\nNote that, as we move outwards from the centre of the dSph, the\ndifferences between the line profiles become more pronounced.\nObservationally speaking, it is easier to obtain radial velocities for\nstars in the centre, but it is stars in the outer parts of the dSph which\nare most useful for breaking the degeneracy between mass and\nanisotropy.\n4 M E T H O D O L O G Y\nAn increase in the line-of-sight velocity dispersion at large radii\nmay by due to either (1) the presence of large amounts of mass at\nlarge radii, or (2) tangential anisotropy in the velocity distribution.\nThe large observed central radial velocity dispersion is compatible\nwith either a massive halo, and a low central density; or no halo,\nand a large central density. In this section, we test our ability to\ndiscern between these possibilities using (i) large radial velocity\nsurveys and (ii) radial velocities and proper motions provided by\nSIM.\n4.1 The likelihood function\nThe problem of comparing discrete radial velocity measurements\nto galactic models has already received much attention (e.g. Little\n& Tremaine 1987; Kochanek 1996; Wilkinson & Evans 1999;\nEvans & Wilkinson 2000). Suppose we are given radial velocities\nvlosi (corrected for the galaxy mean velocity) of N stars in a dSph at\nprojected positions Ri. At each point, we can compute the\nprobability of observing the radial velocity data set\nP\u0085{Ri; vlos i}i\u00881...N ja; g\u0086 \u0088\nYN\ni\u00881\n\u2018\u0085Ri; vlos i;a; g\u0086: \u008541\u0086\nTherefore, we scan a grid of a,g, and at each point compute the\nprobability of observing the entire input data set. Using Bayes\u2019\ntheorem and assuming uniform prior probabilities in the model\nparameters, then the most likely values of a and g are given by\nmaximizing (41). Confidence regions are obtained by applying\ntwo-dimensional x 2 statistics to the likelihood (or the logarithm of\nequation 41).\nThis procedure requires repeated evaluation of the line profiles,\nFigure 5. As Fig. 4, but for locations at projected position R \u0088 4.\nDwarf spheroidals \u2013 I. Models 785\nq 2002 RAS, MNRAS 330, 778\u2013791\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nand direct integration over the DF is too slow and expensive to\nprovide a competitive algorithm. Accordingly, we only use brute\nforce integration to provide a look-up table of the line profiles in a\ngrid in the four-dimensional (a, g, R, v) space. The grid spacing in\na, R and v is linear, whereas the spacing in g is uniform in\nlog(2 2 g). We use cubic splines to interpolate in the logarithm of\nthe line profile between the grid points. Once the look-up table has\nbeen built, this provides an extremely fast and accurate way of\ncalculating the line profiles. Typically, the error in the line profile\n(as inferred by integration over the line-of-sight velocity to recover\nthe surface density) is better than one part in 103. This is still\nsufficient to mislead our maximum likelihood algorithm because\nthe probability (41) is formed by the multiplication of N line\nprofiles. To take account of this small error, we re-normalize each\nline profile to unity after interpolation.\nBefore applying the likelihood algorithm, there are two further\ncorrections that must be applied. First, the line profile is convolved\nwith a Gaussian of width 2 km s21 to allow for observational errors.\nThis is a typical error for data obtained on the 4-m class telescopes,\nlike the William Herschel Telescope with multi-object spectro-\ngraphs. Secondly, the line profile is adjusted for the effect of\nbinaries. This also involves convolution, this time with the binary\ncorrection function b(v). By Monte Carlo sampling binary orbits\ndrawn from the binary distribution in the solar neighbourhood,\ntaking account of tidal circularization of the orbits as described in\nPaper II, we deduce the distribution of velocities Pb(v) induced by\nthe binary motion. This is shown in Fig. 6. The binary correction\nfunction is then given by\nb\u0085v\u0086 \u0088 fPb\u0085v\u0086 \u0087 \u00851 2 f \u0086d\u0085v\u0086; \u008542\u0086\nwhere the constant f is the binary fraction.\n4.2 Radial velocity surveys\nSynthetic data sets are created by choosing phase space coordinates\n{Ri; zi; vRi; vwi; vlos i}i\u00881...N drawn from the DF, and then discarding\nall but the projected positions and the line-of-sight velocities. The\nvelocities are contaminated by measurement noise of amplitude\n2 km s21, and a fraction f of the stars are also assigned a binary\nvelocity which is added to their line-of-sight velocity. To reduce\nthe computation time, rather than randomly selecting the projected\nradius for each star, 10 values of the projected radius Ri between\n0.0 and 2.5 are used. Each data set is then analysed and a most\nlikely value of a and g (or, equivalently, n) is obtained.\nFig. 7 shows the results from the analysis of simulated data sets\nof 160 radial velocities. This is the number of radial velocities that\nare presently available for Draco. Fig. 8 shows the results from\nanalysis of simulated data sets of 1000 radial velocities. This is an\nFigure 6.

In each figure, the scatter plot shows the joint\ndistribution of a and n values obtained from the artificial data\nsets while the histograms show the spread in the individual\nparameter values.\nEven with a data set of the present size, Fig. 7 shows that it is\npossible to put interesting constraints on the value of a. The input\nmodel for Fig. 7 had an a value of 20.5, indicating a dark matter\ndistribution intermediate between that of a flat rotation curve halo\nand an extended harmonic core. From the figure, the 2s confidence\ninterval on a is (21.45, 0.8). Thus data sets containing 160 radial\nvelocities are sufficient to rule out a mass-follows-light halo model\n\u0085a \u0088 1\u0086 at about the 2.5s level. Increasing the size of the data set to\n1000 stars allows much greater discrimination between models.\n4.3 Proper motion surveys\nHere, we consider the possible impact of next generation\nastrometric satellites like SIM and its successors. Microarcsecond\nastrometry to an accuracy of 3\u20136mas yr21 is sufficient to allow the\ninternal proper motions of the brightest stars in Draco to be\nmeasured to 1\u20132 km s21. As all stars in Draco are at almost the\nsame distance, only the relative proper motions are required and\nthis significantly reduces the observing time. A further advantage is\nthat all the target stars are within a ,18 field of view, allowing\nsubdivision of the observations into a small number of overlapping\nfields and hence reducing the instrumental systematic contribution\nto the error. A satellite like SIM is ideal for these measurements,\nas it allows very accurate differential measurements at faint\nmagnitudes.\nTo simulate this, we pick phase space coordinates\n{xi; yi; zi; vxi; vyi; vzi}i\u00881...N drawn from the DF, discard the geo-\ncentric radial position coordinate z, and attempt to recover a and n\nusing the Bayesian likelihood. As in the radial velocity simulations\ndescribed above, we contaminate the data with measurement noise\nin each component of velocity. The correct expression for the\nprobabilities required to analyse these data is then the three-\ndimensional convolution of the DF with three Gaussians, each of\nwidth 2 km s21. However, as was noted earlier, integration of the\nDF is computationally expensive, and we therefore approximate\nthe convolution by a weighted sum over the values of the DF at the\ncorners of a cube of side\n\u0081\u0081\u0081\n2\np\ns. This approach gives sufficiently\naccurate results for the present paper \u2013 in the future, increases in\ncomputational speed will allow us to perform the full three-\ndimensional convolution. At present, we consider only the case\nwhere no binaries are present. This is both computationally\nconvenient, and may be justified on the basis that proper motion\nmeasurements will be based on multiple epoch observations which\nwill allow the identification of binaries in our sample.\nFig. 9 shows the results from the analysis of simulated data sets\nof 160 stars with both radial velocities and proper motions\nmeasured for each star to an accuracy of 2 km s21. Fig. 10 shows\nthe results from analysis of similar data sets containing 1000 stars.\nThe narrow spread visible in these histograms, particularly in the\ncase of 1000 stars, emphasizes the value of having all components\nof the stellar velocities when modelling the mass profile. The key\nfeature of these results, as illustrated in Fig. 9, is that even with\nonly 160 proper motions it is possible to break the degeneracy\nbetween mass and anisotropy unambiguously.\n4.4 Robustness\nIn this section, we consider the robustness of our analysis to errors\nin the estimation of the sample binary fraction and measurement\nerrors. As the same algorithm is used in both cases, we present\nresults only for the former case. We also address the question of the\nextent to which our analysis is model dependent.\nLet us begin by considering data sets in which the binary fraction\nhas been severely underestimated. Data sets of 160 radial velocities\nare generated as described earlier, assuming a binary fraction of 80\nper cent, and measurement errors of 2 km s21. However, when\nanalysing the data, we perform the convolution of the line profiles\nassuming a binary fraction of only 40 per cent. This discrepancy\nrepresents an upper limit to the uncertainty in the binary fraction in\na typical data set of single-epoch radial velocities. The results of\nthis experiment are shown in Fig. 11. Comparison of this figure\nwith Fig. 7 shows that while the distributions of recovered a and g\nFigure 9.

Models 787\nq 2002 RAS, MNRAS 330, 778\u2013791\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nvalues are slightly broadened, the overall effect of the mis-\nestimation of the binary fraction is not serious. The uncertainty\ncaused by the true size of observational errors can be checked in a\nsimilar manner. We generate data sets of 160 radial velocities with\na binary fraction of 40 per cent and measurement errors of\n4 km s21. However, we convolve the line profiles with an error\nGaussian of width 2 km s21 representing an over-optimistic\nestimation of the measurement errors. We do not show a figure\nfor this case, as the results are predictable. Our algorithm is not\nconfused and the results are clustered around the correct values,\nalbeit with a greater spread.\nA more serious question is whether our maximum likelihood\nalgorithm \u2013 which assumes a parametrized fit for the density and\npotential \u2013 is robust, as any dSph undoubtedly deviates to a greater\nor lesser extent from the model. To test this, we generate synthetic\ndata from a very different halo model and analyse them using our\nmodels. We retain the assumption that the light in the dwarf follows\na Plummer profile, but we replace the halo with a Jaffe (1983)\nsphere. The halo potential is then given by\nc\u0085r\u0086 \u0088 v2c log\nr \u0087 rJ\nr\n\u0012 \u0013\n;\nwhere vc is the amplitude of the halo rotation curve at small radii,\nand rJ is the scale radius of the halo. For these simulations, we set\nrJ \u0088 1 and vc \u0088 45:5 km s21, yielding a halo whose rotation curve\nfalls off for r . 1 but for which the total mass enclosed within\nr , 3 is similar to that of an a , 22 (rising rotation curve) model\nfrom our family of Plummer halo models. Following Wilkinson &\nEvans (1999, equation 19) we build a DF (with constant velocity\nanisotropy b) of the form F\u0085E; L\u0086 \u0088 L 22bf \u0085E\u0086. The value of b is set\nto be the mean value of the velocity anisotropy between r \u0088 0 and\nr \u0088 3 for a model with n \u0088 20:2 from our Plummer family. We\nanalyse the data using radial velocities alone.\nFig. 12 shows the results obtained from data sets of 160 radial\nvelocities. The analysis of the Jaffe model data sets returns\nPlummer model parameter values in the region of a \u0088 21:5,\nn \u0088 20:2. Qualitatively, this result is very encouraging, as the\nparameter estimates all lie in the region of the (a, g) plane where\nthe dark matter is more extended than the light in the dSph. More\nquantitatively, the Jaffe data sets return approximately the correct\nvalue of n. The mass enclosed within r \u0088 3, the region probed by\nthe generated data points, is also recovered to better than a factor of\ntwo \u2013 for the (input) Jaffe model we obtain 3:6 \u00a3 108 M(, while\nfor the recovered Plummer halo we obtain 2:2 \u00a3 108 M(. We\nconclude that the parameter values returned by our method are\nreasonably robust, even for a small data set, and that they do reflect\nunderlying physical properties of the data.\n5 C O N C L U S I O N S\nThis paper has presented a flexible family of spherical models\nsuitable for representing dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. The\nmodels have a Plummer profile, which is an excellent fit to the star\ncount data on the nearby dSphs. There are two free parameters. The\nfirst is the dark matter parameter a. When a \u0088 1, the mass follows\nthe light and the rotation curve is asymptotically Keplerian; when\na \u0088 0, the dark matter is distributed in a cored isothermal sphere\nand the rotation curve is flat; and when a \u0088 22, the dSph is\nenclosed within the harmonic core of a much larger dark matter\nhalo. The second parameter is the anisotropy parameter g. When\ng . 0, the models are radially anisotropic at large radii; when\ng \u0088 0, they are isotropic; and when g , 0, they are tangentially\nanisotropic at large radii.\nThese models offer considerable advantages over King models,\nwhich are conventionally used for fitting dSphs (see e.g. Binney &\nTremaine 1987). The single-component, isotropic King models\noften used for modelling the dSphs assume that the mass follows\nthe light and have an isotropic stellar velocity distribution. The cost\nof such strong assumptions is that they are unable to probe the\ndegeneracy that exists between dark matter mass and anisotropy. A\nvery attractive property of our new models is that the intrinsic and\nprojected moments are simple and analytic. In particular, the line-\nof-sight velocity dispersion is available as a function of projected\nFigure 11.

Quadratures over the DF provide us with the\ndistributions of radial velocities (the line profiles) as well as the\ndistributions of proper motions. All these observable quantities are\nreadily available for our family of dSph models! Note that the line\nprofiles of all the models are similar in the centre, but begin to\ndiffer at ,2r0, emphasizing the importance of gathering data at\nlarge radii.\nWe have used our new models to assess what large samples of\nradial velocities can tell us about dark matter in dSphs. All of the\ninformation on the kinematics is contained in the DF. So, given\nlarge samples of stars with projected positions and radial velocities,\nwe calculate the likelihood of observing the data set as a function\nof the dark matter and anisotropy parameters. The distribution of\nradial velocities is corrected first for observational errors by\nconvolution with a Gaussian and second for the contamination\nby binaries by convolution with a suitable correction function.\nSimulated data sets of 160 and 1000 radial velocities are drawn\nfrom the DF, contaminated with measurement noise and binary\nvelocities, and fed into the likelihood algorithm. A sample size of\nhundreds of velocities is typical of the presently available data sets,\nwhereas a sample size of a thousand velocities is an estimate of the\nnumber that may be accessible to a long-term observing program in\nthe nearby dSphs like Draco. Our simulations show that a sample\nsize of 160 stars is already sufficient to make interesting statements\nabout the dark matter distribution in a dwarf galaxy. For example,\nusing data drawn from a model with a slightly rising rotation curve,\nit is possible to rule out mass-follows-light models at about the\n2.5s confidence level. Larger radial velocity data sets allow much\ntighter constraints to be placed on the model parameters. Our\nmachinery is set to work in a companion paper (Paper II) to\ninterpret a newly acquired data set for the Draco dSph.\nThe addition of proper motion data completely breaks the\ndegeneracy between mass and velocity anisotropy, even using only\na hundred or so proper motions. Obtaining such a data set will be\nfeasible using the SIM satellite. One strategy is to construct a\nsample of stars that are uncontaminated by binaries before SIM\nflies, for example, by taking second and third epoch data on\nground-based telescopes and removing all radial velocity variables.\nSIM time is very expensive and it is wasteful to spend it following\nthe astrometric paths of binaries if our aim is to measure the proper\nmotions of single stars. In Draco and Sculptor, the target stars are at\nmagnitudes V , 19 and the required proper motion accuracy\ncorresponding to 1\u20132 km s21 in velocity is 15\u201330mas over the\nmission lifetime of 5 yr. The optimum strategy is to measure the\npositions of the stars twice, once at the beginning and once at\nthe end of the mission. This will be ample to calculate the proper\nmotions, provided all binaries have been eliminated by our ongoing\nradial velocity surveys. SIM takes ,1 h to measure the position of a\nV , 19 star to ,20mas (in one dimension), which is our typical\nrequired accuracy. Hence, for each star, we require 4 h of SIM time\n(for two-dimensional measurements at the beginning and end of\nthe mission). Our simulations have shown that samples of ,100\nproper motions are ample to break the mass\u2013anisotropy\ndegeneracy. This will take about 400 h of SIM time, or roughly\n1.7 per cent of the mission lifetime. In other words, this is an\nextremely competitive use of SIM time.\nGiven the modest amount of SIM time required, our\ncollaboration is considering an ambitious program that acquires\nthe proper motions of roughly a hundred stars in each of Draco,\nUrsa Minor and Sextans. This program will still only consume 5\nper cent of the mission lifetime. Such a data set, together with the\nsophisticated modelling techniques we have introduced in this\npaper, will make it possible to map the dark matter distribution in\nthese three dSph galaxies with unprecedented accuracy. This\nimportant test of the nature of dark matter on such small scales is\nuniquely possible with SIM.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nMIW and JK acknowledge financial support from PPARC.

Let us start with\nthe well-known result (Fricke 1951; Dejonghe 1987; Evans 1994)\nthat the density r0\nr0 \u0088 c pr 2b; \u0085A1\u0086\ncorresponds to the DF\nf 0 \u0088 G\u0085p\u0087 1\u0086\nG\u00851 2 b\/2\u0086\u0085p 2 1=2\u0087 b\/2\u0086\nL 2bE p\u0087b\/223=2\n\u00852p\u00863=222b\/2 : \u0085A2\u0086\nThese are sometimes called Fricke components. From this simple\nresult, we can build up the DF F corresponding to the density\nr \u0088 c p r\n2a\n\u00851\u0087 r 2\u0086a\u0087b ; \u0085A3\u0086\nby a continuous superposition of the Fricke components.

Dejonghe (1986) shows how to evaluate\nthis integral. When x < 1, the contour is completed to the left by\nadding a large semi-circle at infinity.

In fact, none of the standard reference books on\nnumerical methods (e.g. Press et al. 1992) present completely\ngeneral algorithms for the computation of the hypergeometric\nfunction valid for all parameter values. Luke (1977) has derived\nseveral useful Chebyshev and rational polynomial approximations.\nThe coefficients of the hypergeometric series (and its approxi-\nmations) may reverse sign, so that the final value can depend on the\nnear-cancellation of very large terms, rendering the normal\n15-digit floating-point precision of a computer insufficient. The\nparasitic secondary solution of the differential equation, by virtue\nof its steep z 12c growth, renders the integration of the differential\nequation numerically impracticable for c ! 0.\nOur algorithm divides the evaluation of the hypergeometric\nfunction into two regimes. Provided c * 23, the hypergeometric\ndifferential equation (B2) is stable. It is integrated via the standard\nordinary differential equation integration methods provided by\nPress et al. (1992). The initial condition for the integration cannot\nbe chosen as 2F1\u0085a; b; c; z\u0086 \u0088 1 when z \u0088 0, as the differential\nequation (B2) is then singular. Accordingly, we start from z \u0088 e\nand calculate the value of 2F1(a, b, c; z) at this point by direct\nsummation of the hypergeometric series. This is the method of\nchoice for evaluation of the DF when a . 0 or when a , 0 and\njL 2\/\u00852E\u0086j < 1.\nIf c , 23 (as occurs in the expressions for the DF when a , 0\nand jL 2\/\u00852E\u0086j . 1\u0086 and z . 20:5, we compute the power series\nusing standard double precision arithmetic, but switch to arbitrary\nprecision arithmetic whenever the terms of the series exceed 106,\nensuring that the final value will be accurate to nine decimal places.\nArbitrary precision arithmetic is necessary only for a ! 0, or\nc ! 0. If z , 20:5 then we use the transformation (see equation\n9.131.1 of Gradshteyn & Ryzhik 1978)\n2F1\u0085a; b; c; z\u0086 \u0088 \u00851 2 z\u00862a 2F1\u0085a; c 2 b; c; z\/\u0085z 2 1\u0086\u0086 \u0085B3\u0086\nto cast z into z\/\u0085z 2 1\u0086, ensuring that the power series converges\nswiftly for all z of interest.\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX\/LATEX file prepared by the author.\nDwarf spheroidals \u2013 I.
