Child psychotherapists often work with\nchildren who have some learning difficulties, which need to be distinguished\nfrom organic learning disability or handicap. Many learning difficulties have\npsychogenic origins. These include difficulties in being able to make use of the\nexperience of being at nursery or at school, often linked with an inability to\nseparate properly from parent or primary caregiver, in the mind as well as\nphysically. Some children are not able to feel sufficiently free from anxiety or\nfrom preoccupation. One example might be an anxiety that Mummy is totally\ninvolved with a new baby, and will not have her older child in her mind.\nAnother might be an over preoccupation with a phantasy that Mummy and\nDaddy are together and absorbed totally in each other. These are two rather\ngeneralised examples, but they are powerful ones, and when they dominate the\nmind of little, or indeed older children, they inhibit the possibility of welcoming\nnew experiences or finding them exciting or thought-provoking. They are often\nassociated with the broader difficulties of so many children whose early\n*E-mail: tklauber@tavi-port.org\nISSN 1369-8036 print\/ISSN 1745-8943\n# 2009 Tavistock Clinic Foundation\nDOI: 10.1080\/13698030903301866\nhttp:\/\/www.informaworld.com\nInfant Observation\nVol. 12, No. 3, December 2009, 305\u0001318\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nexperiences are not quite \u2018good enough\u2019 (as Winnicott might have thought) to\ncounterbalance the internal fear or anxiety (Winnicott, 1953).\nMany of the children seen in clinics have difficulties in concentration, in\nfocusing the mind, and they struggle to take in information or instruction.\nProblematic or traumatic early experiences often leave children in fear of\nhaving any quiet, mental space, because what so readily floods into their\nminds feels like a re-experience of the early trauma, even if, in reality, it was\nrelatively mild.\nOther children remain rivalrous, competitive, or envious. This may be the\nresult of inadequate experiences of care, support, or attunement, or may in some\ncases link to early parenting which has been over-protective and lacking in\nenough ordinary experience of frustration and struggle. When parents who are\nmature know that some experience of \u2018no\u2019 or \u2018wait\u2019 is not the end of the world,\nthey are more able to bear the real or apparent distress of seeing their children\nfrustrated, and indeed to understand that setting reasonable limits supports their\nchildren\u2019s healthy development.\nChildren, whose difficulties have not been contained or understood, cannot\nbear \u2018not knowing\u2019 or learning a bit at a time. They cannot engage in the struggle to\nlearn, cannot risk making mistakes. For them, mistakes feel like the humiliation of\nbeing accused of being a baby \u0001 their idea of a baby is, of course, despised. They\ncannot really tolerate the presence of others, either. So everything about nursery or\nschool which involves having to wait or to take their turn, to share the space with\nother children, is intolerable.\nLearning\nLearning has many psychological components. What is cognitive and conscious\nin learning has links with the unconscious, with the unique internal world within\neach child. Powerful, unconscious phantasies so dominate the mind that they\noften feel more real than the external world and the opportunities which it offers.\nIn this paper, I want to focus on the healthier aspects of learning, and to link\nthem with the experiences of one particular baby. He has been observed by a\nstudent undertaking an observational studies course in Italy.\nThe little boy, whom I shall call Antonio, is fortunate. He is loved, wanted\nand cared for; he has two parents who are together and the extracts from the\nobservations which I shall use as illustrations give a picture of \u2018ordinary\u2019 and\nvitally important events in his life. Using examples from observations I want to\nthink about how, as he grows older, we can begin to see him striving to use his\nbody and his mind and what he has been given. His earlier experiences, just\nafter his birth, when his mother was much less experienced and was anxious\nbecause she could not breast-feed, appear to have presented opportunities\nfor struggle and for a rich development of his mind and his interests in\nthe world.\n306 T. Klauber\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nTheoretical framework\nFollowing Freud, psycho-analytic theories, particularly those of Melanie Klein\n(1948\/1975, 1952a\/1975, 1952b\/1975), focus strongly on feeding and its links\nwith taking in love, care, and comfort; Klein based her developing theory on her\ndetailed psychoanalytic work with young children, and Wilfred Bion (1962), an\nanalysand of Klein, took these ideas forward in relating feeding of the body, to\nfeeding the mind, and to an understanding of healthy mental development.\nFreud\u2019s earlier exposition of the Oedipus complex is also extremely\nimportant. His understanding of infantile sexuality and of children\u2019s phantasies\ndeveloped from his work with hysterical patients. Later he wrote his Three Essays\non Sexuality (Freud, 1905\/1962), and his fascinating paper about the boy he\ncalled Little Hans. Freud links children\u2019s curiosity with their struggle to find a\nplace in the world beyond myself and mother. Freud wrote about Little Hans\u2019\ncuriosity, his anxiety, his fears linked to phantasies about his father and mother\ntogether, and the birth of his little sister Hannah. Freud suggested that Hans was\nin competition with his father, who he feared would become so angry he might\nattack and castrate Hans. He later related this to an idea of the little boy\u2019s\nown aggression towards father who had a grown-up relationship with mother,\ncould share a bed with her in the night time, and could make babies with her,\nleaving Hans excluded and, no doubt, very angry, upset, and sad at times.\nFreud\u2019s conception of the Oedipus complex, much worked on ever since, is\npowerful and compelling and, for him, linked at its \u2018resolution\u2019 with the\nidea that children could overcome the powerful feelings of toddlerhood, and\nsublimate them in learning, games, and so on.\nKlein (e.g., Klein, 1948\/1975) developed her own ideas on the Oedipus\ncomplex, suggesting that it began much earlier in life. She stressed how innately\naggressive or \u2018sadistic\u2019 little children were, how attacked and fearful they could feel\nand how good experiences, often felt to be wonderful or perfect, could quickly\nturn bad or dangerous; early on these were much more focused on mother, her\nbreasts, face, arms, lap, and so on. She believed that children tried physically and\npsychically to get these feelings out of their bodies and minds. She further\ndeveloped the concept of splitting and later introduced the term paranoid schizoid\nfor a state of mind which, in extreme form, dominates the very early weeks and\nmonths of the baby\u2019s life. She became convinced that children around five or six\nmonths of age were beginning to build up and keep within themselves an\naccumulation of good experiences of care and feeding which allowed them to\nintegrate their experiences little by little in what she termed the depressive position \u0001\na state of mind vitally important for mental health and for the capacity to learn.\nKlein (1928\/1975) strongly linked what she called the epistemophilic instinct\nwith the future development of an appetite for knowledge and curiosity about\nthe wider world and linked it with aggression and with feelings of fear and guilt.\nThe early connection between the epistemophilic impulse and sadism is very\nimportant for the whole mental development. This instinct, roused by the striving\nInfant Observation 307\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nof the Oedipus tendencies, at first mainly concerns itself with the mother\u2019s womb,\nwhich is assumed to be the scene of all sexual processes and developments. The child is\nstill dominated by the libido-position which impels him to wish to appropriate the\ncontents of the womb. He thus begins to be curious about what it contains; what it is\nlike, etc. So the epistemophilic instinct and the desire to take possession come quite\nearly to be most intimately connected with one another and at the same time with the\nsense of guilt aroused by the incipient Oedipus conflict. (p. 188)\nKlein (1948\/1975) links phantasy explicitly to curiosity. She considers that\nthe child\u2019s curiosity about mother and father\u2019s relationship and about how (and\nwhy) they make more babies to be linked closely with an intense interest in\nmother and what is inside her. In the extract I have quoted she is focusing on the\nbaby\u2019s anger, or sadism, which she strongly relates to the development of the\nbaby\u2019s own mind. Klein writes elsewhere about real physical care. She describes it\nas central to a sense of security and an experience of being loved. She also writes\nthat good care is closely linked with a reduction of hostile impulses in babies and\nlittle children and, therefore with sound mental health. It is the predominance of\ngood experience which allows the child to feel able with confidence to be curious\nand to explore without feeling overcome by extreme fears, inhibition or isolation\nfrom reality.\nFor Mrs Klein, the child\u2019s curiosity focuses first on the closest relationship,\nwith mother. \u2018What is she like?\u2019 \u2018What is my position?\u2019 \u2018Have I been ousted from\nparadise?\u2019 \u2018Since I am not inside Mummy is there another baby inside her?\u2019\n\u2018How did the baby get in, who put him there?\u2019 \u2018What does Daddy do \u0001 can he\nget inside?\u2019 \u2018Is Daddy an ally or a foe?\u2019 These questions are rarely voiced directly,\nbut without their expression, in feeling, and later in action and play, children\ncannot explore other relationships or the wider world. Klein is clear that\ncognitive development is inextricably linked with interest, curiosity, and the full\nrange of conflicting feelings, first to parts of Mummy then all of Mummy and\nthen on to Mummy and Daddy.\nBion\u2019s (1962) expansion of Klein\u2019s work concentrated on the parallels\nbetween milk for bodily nourishment, and good experiences and truthfulness as\nfood for the mind. He described a direct link between feeding, and feeling loved\nand cared for, and, later between physical care and the active thoughtfulness of a\nmother trying to understand her non-verbal infant as a function he called alpha\nfunction, which he linked with \u2018containment\u2019 \u0001 a kind of psychological digestive\nprocess metabolising the baby\u2019s worst anxieties, including the fear of dying or of\nabandonment. Mothers contain by putting their minds and their imagination at\nthe disposal of the baby, thinking about them, feeling with them, filtering and\nmentally digesting their experience for them. Over time, the baby begins to\nidentify with the mother who sticks at her task day in and day out, even when\nthe baby is unsettled and unresponsive. Bion also relates the baby\u2019s internalisa-\ntion of mother, mindful of her baby, to the baby\u2019s capacity to begin to think,\nstimulated by mother\u2019s absence; she is not there, but, in his mind, he can begin\n308 T.

This\nprocess begins, of course, with the gradual accumulation of good experience\ntogether over time.\nObservation of Antonio\nAntonio is the first baby of a well-to-do couple. Father is a professional who\nworks long hours and sometimes has to work away from home. Mother has her\nown business. The family moved house three weeks after Antonio was born \u0001\nfrom an elegant town apartment to one in an old villa on the edge of the city.\nMother had apparently already decided before Antonio was born that she would\nreturn to work part time as soon as possible.\nIt is not clear whether mother\u2019s decision was influenced by unexpected\nevents. The baby was born by Caesarean section after the episiotomy \u2018cut more\nthan they thought\u2019 towards the end of labour. There was a sense of struggle as\nmother described the Caesarean scar as a \u2018smile on her tummy\u2019.\nThe parents are good-looking, and elegant, and despite mother\u2019s assertion,\n\u2018I am not a model . . . now I am a mum,\u2019 she seemed to be struggling with\ndisappointment, and perhaps felt she was a little scarred or wounded by the\nexperience, just after the birth. She was not able to breast-feed and described that\nher milk had disappeared very quickly. She complained that the midwives had not\nhelped her with breast-feeding; they had bottle-fed Antonio in the nursing home\nwhere he was delivered and did not let her try to feed him; her paediatrician was\nangry with her for not making an effort. The observer\u2019s personal impression, only\nseven days after the birth, was that mother looked too thin.\nImmediately after the house move, the new apartment was extremely tidy,\npictures were arranged ready for the walls and Antonio was already in his own\nroom, with a baby alarm. On most occasions, for the early Monday morning\nobservation, mother was in pyjamas, the baby just waking for a feed or asleep just\nafter one. Mother was anxious about preparing bottles and warming them, but\nalso declaring that the baby only cried when he woke hungry, and that it was\nmore difficult during the night. The first observed feed, at seven days old, did\nseem difficult \u0001 he sucked with difficulty, pausing from time to time as if he\nneeded a break or needed to catch his breath. After being winded he continued,\nlooking ahead, each arm stretched down along either side of his body. He\nseemed to relax visibly only after the feed when mother held him, walking up\nand down rocking him gently. He opened and closed his eyes slowly and fell\nasleep in her arms. At this point he was very small and thin. Mother spoke to\nhim sweetly, handled him gently, lifted him with great delicacy and declared him\nto be enchanting.\nYet the observer also noticed, in the early weeks, that she did not seem to look\ninto her baby\u2019s eyes, although she talked to him a lot. The baby also seemed\nsomewhat unsure about really opening his eyes to look. He slept a lot. Mother only\nheld him to feed, wash, or change him. She openly expressed a fear of harming him\nInfant Observation 309\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nand said she followed all professional advice very closely. The atmosphere of the\nearly morning observations seemed rather hazy, in the half light, both mother and\nbaby somewhere between night and day as if there was some kind of hesitation\nabout fully waking, fully engaging; yet mother talked about the baby with great\ninterest and concern. Perhaps this apparent contradiction was associated with\nmother\u2019s real disappointment about not being able to breast-feed, and a repeated\nanxiety that not breast-feeding the baby might have done him real damage.\nAntonio himself slept a lot and seemed to wake up very slowly. When he was about\na month old in his own room the observer writes,\nAntonio at 4 weeks\nHe slept, arms down each side of his body, right hand in a fist, left hand open, with\nlong fingers extended and relaxed. He stretched, moving his lips from time to time, as\nif sucking something, then drew up his legs, going very red in the face and still\nsleeping; he stretched again and did not open his eyes. He turned his head from time\nto time, with a frown, extending his arms into the air as if stretching and making small\nshrill sounds which brought his mother to him from the kitchen.\nMother employed a nanny to help to look after the baby and returned to\nwork half time when Antonio was six weeks old. Antonio by this time was\nfeeding well, had grown quickly, had found his fingers and sucked on them. He\noften fed holding on to one of his mother\u2019s fingers.\nMother commented frequently that Antonio did not understand the\nobserver and looked at her in puzzlement because the observer did not pick\nhim up or talk to him. (Perhaps we see here that mother located in the\nobserver her own difficulty in picking up the baby just to hold him and enjoy\nhim in the very early weeks. Perhaps she felt a little persecuted that the\nobserver was not talkative, while mother herself spoke a lot, perhaps using\nspeech to keep some distance from her disappointment, sadness, or fears for\nthe baby.)\nOne observation in early December, at 6.30 pm (a different time) when\nAntonio was two months old, mother had been back at work for three weeks,\nand the paternal grandparents had called without any warning.\nAntonio at 2 months\nAntonio is crying desperately and grandmother keeps on repeating that he is hungry,\nwhile mother insists he could not possibly be hungry as it is only three hours since his\nlast feed. Antonio cries and cries, screwing up his eyes, opening his mouth wide,\nclenching his fist, while first grandfather, then grandmother holds him. Mother, silent\nand tense, makes up a bottle in the kitchen, appearing very alone and anxious.\nEventually grandmother takes the baby from grandfather and hands him over to\nmother who holds him, gazing at him intently, stroking his face, kissing him, asking\nwhy he is crying; is he hungry? She sits with him to give him the bottle still looking\nvery worried, stroking his lips with her finger. He is breathing deeply, crying less\ndesperately, eyes open and arms still. Mother helps him to latch on to the bottle, he\n310 T.

The observer thinks it looks as if he might really\ntake hold of the bottle. He sucks willingly, with tiny breaks for breath. The\ngrandparents leave, and mother, now relaxed, complains about their intrusiveness,\nwhile she also describes Antonio\u2019s recent developments, his smiles, his curiosity, and\nhis expressive face; she and her husband can watch him for hours.\nThe baby gazes intently at his mother\u2019s face, then turns towards the observer and\nlooks at her very carefully; she feels embarrassed. He suddenly refuses any more milk,\nand as Mother helps him to bring up wind he regurgitates a little with each burp.\nMother\u2019s anxiety rushes back \u0001 she is afraid he isn\u2019t growing well \u0001 then she looks at\nhim again and all her fears seem to disappear. Again she seems enraptured. The baby\nsmiles as she holds him up on her lap and regurgitates again. She talks to the observer\nabout pictures she has put up which belong to her father\u2019s partner, her much-loved\nstepmother, and holding the baby she goes to a mirror where she says Antonio is\nlooking at her in the reflection and follows her every movement.\nLater in the living room, Antonio is in his little reclining chair reaching out to\nthe toys his Mother is offering to him, taking hold and smiling as mother repeats the\ngame \u0001 the first time the observer has seen play.\nThe hazy, part-merged, part-engaged early mornings might not have been\ntypical of the whole day, although the atmosphere did seem to persist for quite a\ntime and could have been a counterbalance to the difficulty for both of them in\nexperiencing the reality of mother\u2019s return to work. Perhaps this is illustrated in\nmother\u2019s stress and Antonio\u2019s desperate cries on her return from work observed\nbecause the time of this observation had to be changed. Antonio is desperate for\na feed, not able to wait as long as he normally could, making a different kind of\nurgent demand on his mother. The \u2018bad\u2019 grandparents\/grandmother who did\nnot seem warm and supportive to mother are aware of the baby\u2019s hunger. The\nbaby is much more demanding and he is hungry. Mother discovers this reality\nwhen she does finally concede and make up the bottle. She then sees for herself\nthat he is hungry, and that he needed her, not only to provide the milk, but\nfor herself. Perhaps the little regurgitations which occur after this particular feed\nare also significant. There was something difficult to digest about it, but\nsomething which could allow each of them to develop their understanding; to\nlearn something from the experience they were going through. The regurgitation\nperhaps represents mother and baby reworking and digesting their high\nanxieties, anger and distress and then feeling relieved to rediscover each other\nand to feel better.\nMother talked warmly about how captivated she and her husband felt,\nnoticing tiny details. The observer notices that mother and baby really look\ninto each other\u2019s eyes and at each other in the mirror. The baby\u2019s hand is on\nmother\u2019s finger and on the bottle; he looks as if he might keep a hold if it, an\nInfant Observation 311\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nindication of his need to keep it fixed, not allowing it, or his mother, to\nmove away. Perhaps his embarrassingly intense look at the observer indicates\nthat she is also an object of interest. She might be someone to get to know\nfrom the safety of his mother\u2019s arms, and she might be perceived, if mother\nand baby at this moment have now formed a more actively involved,\ninterested, loving couple, as an intruder in a private scene, an uninvited\nthird party.\nThe closer bond between mother and Antonio, when both are more aware of\nthe separateness, seems to stimulate interest in each other, and in others. It also\nprovides evidence of the baby\u2019s developing mind, interest and curiosity, for\nexample about his bottle, the reflections in the mirror, and the observer. Later,\nsuch an interest can link to many aspects of healthy learning and development:\nan ability to focus and to enjoy family narratives or stories in books; the\ndevelopment of images in the mind leading to the gradual formation of\nquestions about how things work in the world of relationships and in the wider\nworld. As I noted at the beginning of the paper, Klein linked this with the baby\u2019s\ninterest in the contents of mother\u2019s body. Bion would, I think, have added the\ncontents of mother\u2019s mind and, perhaps how the baby identifies with the\nqualities he absorbs, little by little from her, her style, her liveliness of mind, and\nthe quality of her response to his engagement.\nIn the observation reported above, mother mentions a much loved grand-\nmother-figure, her father\u2019s partner; a markedly different figure in her mind from\nfather\u2019s mother, who is experienced as a persecutor and critic. A division is clear\nbetween a loved and a disliked figure in her mind. This is not at all unusual in\nthe early weeks for a new mother. It seems to echo something of the baby\u2019s\nexperience of the world at that point \u0001 heavenly or hellish: needs magically met,\nor feeling the terror of abandonment, starvation or even annihilation. The\ndesperate crying of the baby can sound, as it probably did on that occasion, as if\nit signals the end of the world. All surrounding Antonio were themselves\ndesperate to do something about it.\nThis \u2018falling in love\u2019 which began to develop towards Antonio\u2019s third\nmonth coincided with mother\u2019s decision to work less and to involve grand-\nparents more regularly. She expressly went to the park so that Antonio could\nmeet other babies, but, more likely, to have some company herself with other\nmothers. She continued to experience strong anxiety, for example about sudden\ninfant death syndrome, and Antonio returned to sleep in his parents\u2019 room.\nMother\u2019s moments of intimate and passionate contact with him continued to\ncounterbalance further moments of worry, for example, about his occasional\nconstipation.\nThe baby continued to feed well, to grow and to flourish. He liked to sit with\nhis back against his mother\u2019s body, looking out. From this position he seemed to\ndrink everything in, looking out of the window; smiling, sometimes seeming to\nrecall a feed, as he regurgitated a little milk. He seemed to have an appetite for\nlife and experiences, with the support of his mother (and probably, though not\n312 T. Klauber\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nobserved, his father). It was absolutely clear that his mother was the centre of his\nworld. Her support and her fascination with everything he did seemed clearly\nand inextricably linked with a number of developing capacities. He and she\ncreated lovely dialogues, he replying with new noises to her. She always talked to\nhim, and he listened hard when she was in and out of the room. Conversation\nwas often accompanied by touch and gaze as his repertoire of sounds increased.\nAt this point he seemed more able to communicate some ambivalence, mixed\nfeeling, about tolerating separation. So, for example, at around four months he\nwould take his time before opening his eyes, although he was waking up, and\nthen mother would have to wait again before he smiled. He sometimes waited\nuntil she talked to him for quite a long time, as if he had to take his time to\nreadjust or even, perhaps, to feel cross and to forgive her, for leaving him alone\nall night. He could not resist smiling in the end. He also began to protest when\nhe was put down or changed.\nThe ability to protest, to resist smiling, to make someone wait, giving\nmother something of his experience of her, is interesting within the context of\ninternalising a learning framework. It implies that he had a growing confidence\nin his mother. Perhaps some of what might have happened in the earlier\nweeks, had mother been a little less distant, came in to be worked through at\nthis point as well. But in terms of a development he seemed confident in\nletting mother know he did not like the separation, even if part of it was his\nown need to sleep; he did not like the waiting or being out of contact with\nmother. His vigorous protest suggests also, that he had an experience of a\nsufficiently strong and lively mother at this point who would tolerate, or as\nBion might have said, would metabolise, what he communicated through\nprojection. The benign receptivity of mother to his mild but evident\ndispleasure becomes a prototypical experience which he can take back into\nhimself \u0001 this is not destructive. He protests, it is taken in by mother and\ntransformed. It is a communication taken in, and he experiences a mother who\ncontinues to love, to be interested and to take care of him, strengthening\ninternal structures which can be carried forward into future relationships,\nseparate from mother.\nAntonio continues, by five and a half months, to develop. He stretches to get\nthings and grab them; he tries to roll and to pull himself up to standing. He is\nvery expressive, and is serious when new people present themselves or his mum\nleaves him. He is beginning to get into real conversations with more sounds.\nOne month later, when the observer comes at an evening time on a different day\n(because of the Easter holiday) he looks, to her mind, much tougher, wrinkling\nhis forehead when she arrives. He also has \u2018d\u2019 consonants in his sounds. Not just\n\u2018Aaaah,\u2019 but \u2018Dad . . . a\u2019. He is more possessive with his mother, grabbing hold\nof her hair, mouth wide open, making more noises and ending with what the\nobserver describes as a hard laugh. He is continuing to comment robustly in his\nown way on changes, perhaps even on a change of observation day. He is also\nwilling to take fruit from a spoon, does not like pure\u00b4es and is drinking rather less\nInfant Observation 313\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nmilk. Weaning has begun with the pain of change and loss and with new and\ndifferent opportunities, some with a harder edge to them, like the consonants he\ncan now pronounce.\nThe hardness of the spoon\u2019s edge, the journey from bowl to mouth, different\ntextures, and a sense of space between baby and mother all contribute to\nopportunities for the baby to get his mind, with mother\u2019s support and\ncontainment, around experiences which may either be felt as new adventures\nand exploration, or as an exile from physical intimacy and softness. The baby is\npresented with the opportunity to work at this transition and with many other\ndevelopmental challenges at this point. The \u2018d\u2019 sound is suggestive of something\nmore difficult, challenging, potentially exciting, perhaps becoming associated\nwith something more masculine; intimations of a greater sense of the reality of\nDaddy.\nGoing to nursery\nAt 13 months old Antonio has just begun to go to nursery two afternoons a\nweek. He is in his third week. He also goes to baby gymnastics. Mother wants\nhim to have social contact with children his own age and the staff find him\nfriendly, sociable and skilled in many ways.\nAntonio at 13 months\nAs mother talks, Antonio, in the hall, has been hitting the flat of his hands against the\nclosed doors of the lift. Back in the apartment, he keeps an eye on the observer as\nhe reaches up to take a tube of lip balm, removes the cap, replaces it and hands it to the\nobserver. He repeats his action. He licks the balm as mother leaves to prepare his\nlunch.\nDoors, and opening and closing, seem to be on his mind as does something\nto lick as mother moves into the kitchen.\nAntonio continues to play with the lip balm then turns and walks, for the first time in\nthe observers\u2019 presence, towards his father\u2019s office where he moves slowly to hide the\nlip balm behind a big table. He bends down, gets up and rises on to his tiptoes, trying\nto see what is on the table, and then, scanning the bookshelves, moving his hand along\nthe edge of the shelves, reaching up and skimming the papers and books with his\nfingertips. After a while, again on tiptoes he stretches himself tall, drops down out of\nsights for a second and reappears in the middle of the room. He is studying everything\naround him with concentration. He notices the cupboard near the door and moves to\nit slowly, stops in front of it and opens the sliding door. He places his hands on the\ndoor and presses so hard his fingers turn red. He looks inside, moves his hands over\nsome towels and on to a sports bag. He leaves the closet and goes back towards the\ntable, behaving, as the observer notes, \u2018like a young Indiana Jones in unknown\nterritory\u2019. He rises again on tiptoes, walking along the length of the table with one\nhand running along its edge. He still has the lip balm held tightly in his other hand.\n314 T. Klauber\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nSuddenly he stops, looks down beyond the table, and then again on his tiptoes tries to\nsee over the top. He walks back and forth looking at everything, and as he moves he\ntrips over his father\u2019s slipper, staggers and rocks. The observer fears he will fall, but he\nkeeps his balance, and after a second of unease he comes towards her wearing the\nslipper and continuing on his way.\nMother pops her head in and comes to watch as Antonio walks with one huge\nslipper on his foot. She asks him what is he doing and says he is silly. He takes off the\nslipper and looks again into the cupboard, and picks up the lip balm he had dropped.\nHe checks, smiling, that the observer is following him, and he trips on the rug, throws\nhis hands forward, lets go of the lip balm and it rolls under the bed. He holds on to the\nbedspread, looking under the bed for the balm which he cannot reach. He tries lying\ndown and manages to brush it with his finger tips. It rolls out of reach and he stares\nsilently at the observer, looks under the bed, looks back at her and utters a loud \u2018Eeee\u2019.\nShe bends down, and rolls the lip balm back towards him. He grabs it, stands up,\nsmiles, and points to a tape measure on the wall saying \u2018Mba\u2019 (Bambino-baby, thinks\nthe observer).\nThen in the living room he tries to press buttons on the TV \u0001 but it is switched off\nso nothing happens. He lets go of the lip balm and studies the situation. The tube rolls\nunder the TV, and his mother calls him to have lunch. Mother tells the observer that\nhis father is on a business trip to Asia and that mother and Antonio have been\n\u2018orphans\u2019 for two days.\nThere is a lot of activity in Antonio\u2019s mind. He seems to be working hard,\nthinking and working through a number of themes, with his mother and away\nfrom her in the presence of the observer. It is only three weeks since he has\nbeen going out with his mother to the baby gymnastics and spending time\naway from her at nursery. This is a much bigger step away from his mother\nthan any earlier ones. In addition, at the time of this observation, his father is\naway on business. His first act, slapping the lift doors, suggests at the least that\ndoors are on his mind \u0001 openings to the outside world and into his home.\nCertainly they may be immediately associated with the arrival of the observer,\nbut surely there must be other links \u0001 with being away from Mummy all\nmorning, with the opening through which father left. He hits them \u0001 perhaps\nto assert that he could have control, perhaps in anger? Perhaps he wants to\nleave and give his mother a taste of how it feels. The opening and closing\ntheme continues when he takes the lid on and off the lip balm, licking it as\nmother goes to the kitchen. Again he is the one in control and also the one\nwho needs to keep a tight hold on something \u0001 which might remind him of\nhis mother.\nAs he hides the lip balm behind the table and finds it again, he seems to be\nelaborating further a game of \u2018gone\u2019 and \u2018come back again,\u2019 replaying it over and\nover in his mind, in play working his mind around the idea that \u2018come back\u2019 is\nalso there \u0001 an elaboration of playing peek-a-boo with the observer after the gap\nwhen he did not see her nor she him.\nInfant Observation 315\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nHe is getting up on tiptoes quite a lot \u0001 perhaps he needs to do some of this\nwork while projecting himself into the identity of a taller person, a man, in\nanticipation of being as big and capable as Daddy. On tiptoe he looks under the\ntable, across its surface, and wants to touch a lot of papers and books on the\nshelves. He wants to check with look and touch where everything is, and to look\nup and down and along as if to check and check again on whether things\ncontinue to be there, or, perhaps whether they might move or disappear. It seems\nlike a very serious game for which he needs to be as tall as possible to keep an eye\non it all \u0001 whether being Daddy or being a bit like him, a bigger version of\nAntonio.\nThen the \u2018young Indiana Jones\u2019 finds the cupboard, slides its door open,\ntouches the contents, the towels and sports bag, pressing very hard on the sliding\ndoor, and turning back again to the table, runs his finger along the whole length\nof the edge of its surface, exploring, looking around, needing to check everything\nrepeatedly. He needs to be on tiptoes to see above, as well as to bend and look\nunder, and to look along and around. So much needs to be explored at the same\ntime. As he turns to the observer, he staggers and nearly falls \u0001 now seeming not\nto be quite able to control everything \u0001 but managing a recovery \u0001 wearing one\nof Daddy\u2019s shoes. Now perhaps he does feel he has really stepped right into\nfather\u2019s shoes and identity \u0001being Daddy. As he loses hold of the lip balm and\nhas to find it again, one can begin to imagine a lot of things going on in his\nmind. Mother has just been in and gone out again. She has called him \u2018silly\u2019 in\nhis Daddy\u2019s slipper, and he seems to have lost something, he needs to find again \u0001\nsomething perhaps which links him back with his mother (the balm), comfort,\nand reassurance in a moment of anxiety. When the observer helps him to retrieve\nit he regains his confidence.\nDiscussion\nAntonio is discovering, little by little, that he can survive away from his mother\nfor slightly longer periods of time. He is also struggling with his father\u2019s absence\nand working at a number of questions. Some are clearly related to coming and\ngoing, and to working through, with the lift and the cupboard doors and the\ndropped and re-discovered lip balm, that separation can end in rapprochement,\nor reuniting.\nFather, represented by his office and its contents, is very alive in Antonio\u2019s\nmind. This seems, for Antonio, to be linked with certain other questions, and\nwith acquiring certain skills in order to deal with them. He becomes big to\nmanage his little boy anxiety in the absence of Daddy (and Mummy is not in\nthe room either), he steps into Daddy\u2019s slipper, slipping into a more fully\nprojective identification with Daddy, who, in a tiny boy\u2019s mind is all powerful\nand all knowing. He also trips and falls, discovering that growing up or being\nbig, is not quite so easy or pain-free as he had imagined. He has so much to\n316 T. Klauber\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nthink about all at once. He becomes anxious and angry when Mummy or\nDaddy is not there. He does not know that books and papers are not animate \u0001\nisn\u2019t quite sure at any rate \u0001 and suddenly feels he has to watch everything all\nthe time. Anything, or anyone, might move (away) from him, out of his\ncontrol. The anxiety is palpable but not so pervasive that he is unable to use\nhis mind. And his work rate, like that of so many healthy, developing little\nchildren, is phenomenal.\nAs he learns more, more questions emerge, and he again shows his mixed\nfeelings. He is at times angry or frustrated that things don\u2019t just stay where he\nwants them to be or do what he wants, and there is always more work. For\nexample, it seems clear that Mummy does things without Antonio, and so does\nDaddy. His interest in Daddy\u2019s cupboard is interesting. He puts his hand on\nthe contents, touching the towel and the sports bag \u0001 seeming reassured and\nstrengthened by the touch once in there, having seemed driven to slide the\ndoor open, exerting pressure until his hand goes red \u0001 as if he must see the\ncontents of the cupboard; he is not to be excluded. This seems to illustrate\nKlein\u2019s concept of interest in the contents of mother\u2019s body represented by the\ncupboard. Perhaps his father\u2019s absence lends him the boldness to explore\npaternal territory and his phantasies about father, perhaps his separations\nhave led him to begin to conceptualise that another baby might displace\nhim inside his mother \u0001 and that father has some part in putting a baby\nin there.\nHis learning is fascinating to observe and he has entranced the observer as well\nas his loving parents. It is possible that a different baby and mother couple who had\nsimilar early experiences might have developed very differently, with much less\nenergy, drive and greater timidity. Antonio with his mother, most likely well\nsupported by father as well as others, has made use of certain experiences and\nfrustrations as spurs to the development of his capacity to communicate and to play\nlinked to a growing liveliness and expansion of his mind.\nConclusion\nInfant observation, among other things, affords the opportunity to see the\ndevelopment of a growing mind and the links between the mother\u2019s (and\nfather\u2019s) capacity to feel supported and to learn and grow from the new\nexperience, and the baby\u2019s capacity to feel supported and contained. Adverse as\nwell as favourable experiences stimulate an enthusiasm and appetite for life and\npromote curiosity about other people and the wider world which, in turn,\nthrough play and symbol enrich internal mental life and the relationship with\ninternal objects. The essence of this is the quality of early and close\nrelationships which are internalised by the baby from birth and which form\nthe complex template of identifications, both projective and introjective, which\nover time determine the particular character and focus of future formal and\ninformal learning.\nInfant Observation 317\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n8:2\n7 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nReferences\nBion, W.R.
