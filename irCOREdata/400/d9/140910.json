Introduction \nThe beneficial effect of cold expansion on fatigue life improvement of fastener joints needs no further \nintroduction. The technique of cold expansion has been employed for over 40 years [1-4]. Of the \nnumerous existing techniques, the split sleeve cold expansion method has been widely used in the \naerospace industry and compares favorably with other techniques [5]. While cold expansion is being used \nincreasingly for new aircraft to ensure that the service life of critical components meets or exceeds the \n                                                          \n* Corresponding author.

Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n2 \n \nrequired design life, the process may also be applied for in-service aircraft for repairing unanticipated \nfatigue damage or as a general means of life extension. Since the fastener holes of most existing aircraft \nwere not cold expanded at build, there has been a drive to quantify the economic and structural benefits of \ncold expansion which is applied when an aircraft is part way through its service life. This strategy is \nparticularly important to improve the cost effectiveness of operating ageing aircraft. Although there exist \nmany published papers on life improvement of cold expanded holes in sheet structures, the available \nevidence on the benefit of cold expanding fatigue-aged fastener holes is limited. The state-of-the-art in \nthis area is summarized below.  \nWagner et al [4, 6] described a comprehensive test programme evaluating the benefits of cold expansion \nfor open hole specimens made of two aerospace aluminium alloys, 2024-T3 and 7075-T6. While the \npaper focused on the rework process for pre-cycled holes that were cold expanded on production, it also \nlooked at the effect of cold expanding fatigue-aged plain production holes. In the case of the 2024-T3 \nspecimens, this part of the test was conducted under constant amplitude loading at two different stress \nlevels. At the higher stress level (193 MPa), 30% fatigue ageing of the plain hole specimens followed by \ncold expansion resulted in a seven-fold improvement in fatigue life over the plain hole specimens. \nFurthermore, for specimens that were not cold expanded on production, cold expansion in the first 50% of \nthe baseline life resulted in fatigue lives up to 50% greater than cold expansion at build.  \nBuxbaum & Huth [1] investigated cold expansion of joint specimens using both constant amplitude and \nstandardized aircraft spectrum loads MINI-TWIST and FALSTAFF. Cold expansion was applied to \nfatigue-aged specimens after cycling to one of three predefined crack sizes: 1.0, 2.6, and 6.0 mm. They \nfound that the gain in fatigue life due to cold expansion decreased with increasing initial crack length; \ntherefore cold expansion process should not be applied to crack lengths larger than the radius of the hole.  \nCook [7] investigated repair of cracked fastener holes by cold expansion. He looked at low-load and \nmedium-load transfer joints in four types of aluminium under the FALSTAFF loading at two different \npeak stress levels. Cold expansion was applied at a range of predefined crack lengths from 0.5 to 3.0 mm. \nThe results showed that the optimum enhancement occurred with cracks of less than about 1 mm present, \nbut cold expansion was still effective at crack lengths up to 3.0 mm.  \nThe aim of the present work was to examine the effectiveness of cold expansion that is applied at a \nfraction of the total fatigue life of a non-cold expanded control specimen, irrespective of any fatigue \ncracks that may exist due to the fatigue pre-cycling. This simulates the practical situation of life \nenhancement for in-service aircraft that were not cold expanded on production and have expended a \nportion of their service lives prior to cold expansion. The program comprised two parts: experimental \ntesting and theoretical life prediction. Experimental test was the primary objective with emphasis on the \ntotal fatigue lives to determine resulting life improvement factors (LIFs). Also of interest was the relative \ngains or losses in the crack initiation and crack growth lives, and the nature of the crack growth. Two \ngeometrically similar specimens, open-hole and low-load transfer joint, were tested. The correlation \nbetween open hole and fastener hole results was also studied. The second part of this work focused on \ndeveloping a model for predicting fatigue life of cold-worked holes to evaluate the benefits in both crack \ninitiation and crack growth stages. Crack growth life prediction was performed using the AFGROW \ncomputer program and published residual stresses models.  \n2. Experimental procedures \n2.1 Specimens preparation \nA low-load transfer joint (LLTJ) specimen and an open-hole specimen of similar geometry were made of \naluminium alloy 2024-T351. The joint specimen typically represents a span-wise attachment of aircraft \nwing panels, e.g. skin to stringers. This kind of joints is defined as those that have a load transfer between \nthe members of less than 10% of the total axial load [11]. The joint specimen consisted of a reverse \ndouble dog-bone design as illustrated in Fig. 1. This design is based upon the standard AGARD \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1249-1257. Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n3 \n \n(Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development) low-load transfer joint specimen for fastener \nevaluation [12]. The design resulted in only a small amount of secondary bending and a load transfer of \napproximately 5% of the applied load through each of the fastener connections [12].  \nThe test programme is shown in Table 1, which included non-cold expanded (NCx or plain hole) tests, \ncold expansion on production (Cx, or 0%Cx), and cold expansion at various percentages of fatigue lives \n(25%Cx, 50%Cx, and 75% Cx) [8-10]. \nThe FTI split sleeve cold expansion method [3-4] was used in this study. This is a form of mandrelizing \nwhich employs a lubricated sleeve as an interface between the mandrel and the hole. The expansion \nprocess consists of pulling an oversized tapered mandrel through the hole causing very high radial \npressures to be exerted on the hole thus expanding the hole well beyond the yield strength of the material. \nThis results in a zone of residual compressive stress that extends approximately one radius from the edge \nof the hole. The magnitude of the peak compressive residual stress is approximately equal to the yield \nstrength of the material [3]. The cold expansion was always performed with the split in the sleeve (ridge) \nlocated in parallel to the load path, i.e. at the 3 o\u2019clock position of the holes as seen in Fig. 1. \n \nTable 1 Test programme and summary of results.  \nSample \ntype \nSample \nnumber \nDescription Pre-cycle \nbefore Cx \n(Flights) \nTotal failure \nlife (Flights) \nLogarithm mean \nlife (Flights) \nOpen \nhole \nNCx01 \u2013\nNCx05 \nPlain hole \n(NCx) \n0 7959, 8580 \n7592, 7944, \n7961 \n8001 \n Cx01 \u2013  \nCx 05 \nCx at build 0 24733, 27688 \n25603, 30404 \n27021 \n 25%Cx01 \u2013 \n25%Cx05 \nCx at 25% life 2000 33281, 35204 \n31204, 27203 \n26403 \n30469 \n 50%Cx01 \u2013 \n50%Cx05 \nCx at 50% life 4000 25603, 21602, \n19202, 22402 \n(35204)* \n22086  \n 75%Cx01 \u2013 \n75%Cx03 \n \nCx at 75% life 6000 21603, 14402 \n(5601)* \n17639  \nLLTJ J04 - J06 Plain hole N\/A 10680 \n9211, 9759 \n 9865 \n J03* Cx at Build 0 17,572 17572 \n J07, J08 Cx at build 0 32324, 35772 34004 \n J11, J12 Cx at 25% life 2400 31631, 39031 35137 \n J09, J10 Cx at 50% life 5000 21972, 26129 23961 \n J13, J14 Cx at 75% life 7400 21029, 13372 16769 \n  J15  \n Control test \nPlain hole \ncleaned & \nreassembled at \n75% life \nN\/A 11372 11372 \n* Results of these specimens were not included in the mean lives.  \n \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1249-1257.

For the open-hole specimens, the \nnominal expansion rate was 4.0-4.4% resulting retained expansion of 2.8-2.9%. For the joint specimens, \nthe starting hole size met the starting hole size requirements by the FTI process specification [2] resulting \nin average nominal expansion of 4.1%. The plain hole joint specimen hole diameters result in a slight \nclearance fit (0.2\u20130.9%) when used with a \u00bc inch Hi-Lok fastener.

The \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1249-1257. Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n5 \n \nspectrum consists of a uniquely defined sequence of numbers, ranging from 1 to 32, representing the \nvalues of peaks and troughs. The complete sequence represents 200 flights and consists of 35,966 turning \npoints. The spectrum is applied by defining the maximum peak stress value and the loading frequency. In \nthis study the tests were conducted with a peak net stress of 300 MPa. \n2.3 Measurement of crack length \nCrack lengths were measured through the use of acetate replicas, which were examined under an optical \nmicroscope. The procedure consisted of periodically stopping the fatigue testing at the end of a loading \nblock, applying a static load equal to approximately 60% of the peak load (to increase the visibility of the \ncrack tip), and applying cellulose acetate pieces which were softened with acetone and then applied to the \nsurface of the specimen and bore of the hole. The replicas were then examined under an optical \nmicroscope. The crack lengths were tracked on both sides of the specimen as well as within the bores of \nthe holes. The crack length data obtained is considered accurate to within 10 \u00b5m.  \n3. Test results  \nThe baseline life was determined by the total fatigue life of the plain specimens. 3-5 specimens were \ntested for each case. The logarithm mean life was used for the control case.  For example, for the open \nhole test the mean life for the plain specimens was 8001 flights. Therefore, the 25% part-life specimens \nwere pre-fatigued for a period of 2000 flights before cold expansion was applied, and the 50% part-life \nspecimens for 4000 flights, and so forth. The results show that part-life cold expansion offered substantial \nlife improvements, but the actual benefit is dependent upon the degree of pre-cycling. Details are \ndiscussed in next section.    \nFor all cold expanded specimens, a noticeable trend is the difference in crack growth between the mandrel \nentry and exit faces. In all cases cracks grew faster on the mandrel entry face than on the mandrel exit \nface (Fig. 2). This can be explained by the fact that the mandrel exit face has higher compressive residual \nstress levels compared to the mandrel entry face [15-17]. The difference in the residual tangential stress at \nthe entry and exit faces has been attributed to the level of retained expansion and to the material volume \ncarried by the mandrel movement [18].  \n \n \n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000\nFlights\nC\nra\nck\n le\nng\nth\n (m\nm\n)\nL-F\nR-F\nL-B\nR-B\n \nFig. 2 Crack growth curves from a coldworked hole.

Prediction of crack growth life  \n4.1 Life prediction model \nIt is accepted that the fatigue failure process can be separated into four stages, i.e. crack nucleation, short \ncrack growth, long crack growth, and final fracture. In terms of fatigue lifetime, the entire process \ncorresponds to the so-called total fatigue life. In the field of engineering fatigue analysis, especially \naeronautical fatigue analysis, the total fatigue life (Nt) is often divided into two stages, i.e. crack initiation \nlife (Ni) and crack propagation life (Np): \n Nt  = Ni + Np        (1) \nCurrently Ni is calculated by the traditional fatigue analysis using a cumulative damage rule; it includes \nboth crack nucleation and early crack growth lives. Np is predicted by fracture mechanics theory. \nDefinition of crack initiation, which separates the two stages of life, is generally application dependent; it \ndepends on the calculation method for crack initiation life, the volume of data available for subsequent \nanalysis, and also the different points of view. From the crack initiation point of view, this crack length \nshould be around 0.25 mm [19]. This is because that fatigue analysis for notched parts is based on the \nlocal stress-strain approach using the Neuber\u2019s rule and material\u2019s S-N or \u03b5-N data. The latter are derived \nfrom small coupon samples (usually a bar of 6 mm in diameter). The fatigue life between the initiation of \na 0.25 mm crack to final fracture is very short for small coupons, e.g. 7% of the total life [20]. Although \nthe stress gradient of notched samples will change the percentage of crack initiation life, many \nresearchers agree that the initial crack length is between 0.25\u20130.5 mm for notched samples [19-20]. On \nthe other hand, the initial crack length should be detectable with high confidence. For example, the SAE \nhas suggested initial crack length of 2.54 mm (0.1 in) based upon wider experimental research [19]. In the \naerospace industry the initial crack length is usually larger than 1.5 mm to which a design engineer might \nrealistically comprehend or visualise.  \nTherefore we define two initial crack lengths: initial crack length ai that is initiated due to fatigue \ncumulative damage mechanism and is the starting crack length for subsequent fracture mechanics \nanalysis, and minimum detectable crack length ad that is the initial crack length in engineering design and \nanalysis. We also define a critical crack length, acr, at which fast fracture occurs. Ni is defined as the crack \ninitiation life from the first load cycle to the formation of a detectable crack length (ad), and Np the crack \npropagation life from ad to acr. Therefore the crack initiation life Ni is calculated in two steps:  \n Ni  = Nai + Nad       (2) \nWhere Nai is the life to nucleate a short crack (ai), and Nad the early crack growth life from ai to ad. Life \nNai can be calculated by the classic fatigue theory using the material\u2019s fatigue data and a cumulative \ndamage rule. The early crack growth life Nad is calculated by the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics \n(LEFM). In this work we have assumed ai = 0.5 mm and ad = 1.5 mm. As mentioned previously the \nfraction of life consumed during crack initiation is not a distinct value therefore the decision on the crack \nlengths ai and ad is somewhat arbitrary. However, the values defined here are within the range for \naeronautical fatigue analysis.  \nWith reference to aircraft fatigue the above assumptions define two distinct stages in the fatigue lifetime: \nNi is the so-called \u201csafe-life\u201d period where no inspection is required, and Np is the crack growth life that \ncan be used for the damage tolerance design and structural inspection programmes. Fig. 5 illustrates this \nconcept, by which more accurate prediction of crack initiation life may be achieved because Ni is \ncalculated by a combined fatigue and fracture mechanics analysis.  \nThe crack nucleation life Nai is dominated by shear deformation and is usually predicted by empirical \napproaches that correlate experimental data into either S-N or \u03b5\u2212N curves and then use a cumulative \ndamage rule. Some models were described by various investigators [19-20]; both studies used the initial \ncrack length of 0.25 mm. Using this classic fatigue approach the cyclic stress (or strain) range is the \ndominant variable for damage accumulation. The coldwork process does reduce the cyclic mean stress \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1249-1257. Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n8 \n \nnear the hole edge, but the stress range is about the same as that of a plain hole. Therefore, although \ncoldwork increases crack initiation life, the life improvement in this stage is marginal. In fact many tests \nhave shown that cold expansion has little effect on crack nucleation life for the following reason. The \nbeneficial residual stress introduced by cold expansion process is the tangential stress component that is \nacting along the loading direction and perpendicular to a mode I crack. However, crack nucleation and \nearly growth appear to be dominated by local shear deformation and the initial short crack tends to be \nabout 45o to the loading direction. The classic fatigue analysis has difficulty to predict the coldwork \neffect.  \n \nFig. 5 Schematic of the total life concept with definitions on different initial crack lengths. \n \n \nFig. 6 Residual stress distributions determined by different closed-form models and compared with \nan X-ray diffraction test. \nIn this paper fatigue lifetime to develop a detectable crack ad is predicted in two steps, Nai and Nad; the \nlatter is calculated by the LEFM theory.

Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n9 \n \nstress is compressive near the hole edge within the distance of 1-2 times of the hole radius (Fig 6). \nConsequently, crack growth rate will be reduced when a crack is in that region. Fracture mechanics \nmethod can predict this effect using a superposition of residual stress intensity and the stress intensity \nresulting from the applied load [20]. Using the cumulative damage approach to calculate the initiation of a \nlarger detectable crack will not predict this beneficial effect of coldwork. On the other hand, crack growth \nlife under spectrum loading is considerably different from that under constant amplitude testing. In \ngeneral crack growth represents a larger percentage of spectrum test life because of the crack growth \nretardation effects due to intermittently applied high tensile load cycles. Again, fracture mechanics can \npredict this effect in the early crack growth stage, i.e. ai to ad.   \nThis paper focuses on predicting crack growth life with cold expansion effect; the crack nucleation life \nfor cold worked holes Nai (to initiate ai) is obtained directly from the test results. \n4.2 Crack growth life prediction \nIn this study fatigue life prediction was performed for the open-hole specimen since it\u2019s easier to measure \nthe crack length against the load histories. The analysis used an existing analytical solution for the \nresidual tangential stress and the LEFM theory for predicting crack propagation. Firstly, four closed-form \nresidual stress models were studied. They are the plane-stress models proposed by Hsu-Forman [21] and \nBall [22], and plane-strain models by Rich-Impellizzeri [20] and Chang [23]. For the open hole specimen, \nthe residual stress distributions described by these analytical models showed considerable differences in \nterms of stress profile, reverse yield zone size and the maximum residual stress. Since the thickness of the \nspecimen was 6 mm, which fits in neither the plane-stress nor the plane-strain condition, differences were \nexpected and some modification was necessary in order to use these models. A comparative study of \nthese models was carried out based on life prediction results of three different tests, and necessary \nmodifications mainly for the work hardening and the Bauschinger effects were suggested [24]. For the \nopen-hole specimen of this study calculated residual tangential stress profiles using the modified closed-\nform solutions are given in Fig. 6. Measured residual stress distributions are included in the plot showing \nreasonable agreement with the Ball\u2019s and Chang\u2019s models near the hole region. The measurement was \nmade by the X-ray diffraction technique [17], in which the same material (2024-T351), same dimensions, \nand same degree of cold-expansion were used except that the specimens in [17] were much wider than \nthat of this study. However, this should not affect the residual stress distributions near the hole edge.   \nTo account for the effect of residual stresses, the effective stress intensity factor, Keff, is determined by \n[20]: \nK K Keff appl res= +        (3) \nwhere, Kappl is the stress intensity factor due to applied stresses, and Kres the stress intensity due to the \nresidual stress field. Crack growth rate is determined by a Paris type law using the effective stress \nintensity range [20]: \nda\ndN\nf Keff= ( )\u2206       (4) \nThe analysis was performed by the AFGROW computer code [25], which has the facility to calculate the \nresidual stress intensity and the effective stress intensity factors. The users can simply input the known \nresidual stress distributions through a dialog window. There are two methods available in the AFGROW \nto calculate the residual stress intensity factors. They are the Gaussian integration and the weight function \nmethod [25]. The Gaussian integration method was used in this study. \nThe geometrical model used was a double corner crack emanating from a central hole. Crack only grew \non one face of the specimen, however it did give control over the lengths of the surface crack length and \nthrough-thickness crack. The crack grew symmetrically on either side of the hole and, once a through-\nthickness crack was achieved, the crack front became straight. Although this may not simulate the \ninitiation or early corner crack pattern of the experimental specimens, it was thought to be adequate when \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1249-1257. Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n10 \n \nusing the average crack length from both sides. A new model option is now available in the new version \nof AFGROW that allows cracks to be initiated on both faces of the specimen and that may have addressed \nsome of these issues. However, this function was not operational in the version when this study was \nmade.  \n4.3 Prediction results \nThe initial crack size (ai) was set at 0.5 mm to correlate with the experimental data and corner crack \naspect ratio was set at 1. To initiate a 0.5 mm crack, approximately 7370 and 11340 flights were needed \nfor the plain and Cx holes, respectively. Therefore these flights were taken as the lives (Nai) for initiating \nai = 0.5 mm. The life to initiate a 0.5 mm crack is considerably longer for the Cx specimens, but the life \nimprovement at this stage is not as significant as the published life improvement in the total fatigue life \nfor reasons discussed in Section 4.1. The life to develop a detectable crack length ad is the sum of Nai and \nNad; the latter is predicted by the AFGROW code. To account for the overload retardation effect, the \nWillenborg model was employed. \nThe predicted crack growth lives are given in Figs. 7 and 8 (smooth lines) for the plain and cold expanded \nspecimens, respectively. The experimentally measured crack growth histories are also shown in the \nfigures (scattered symbols). Symbols L and R signify the left and right hand sides of the hole when \nviewed from the front when the specimen was in the test machine, while F and B represent the front and \nback faces of the specimen. Each figure shows four experimental tests, and every corner crack is \nincluded. Based on our previous work [10, 24], the Ball\u2019s residual stress model [22] was used for residual \nstress calculation. These figures show that the computer simulation not only predicted the average lives \ncorrectly, for both plain and cold-expanded holes, but also mimicked the crack growth histories \nreasonably well. Life improvement was found mainly in the crack initiation life (Ni) under the assumption \nof a detectable initial crack ad  = 1.5 mm. Since the specimen was narrow (25 mm wide) and the critical \ncrack length was about 3.6 mm, the benefit of the residual compressive tangential stress (within 4 mm \nfrom the hole edge) was not fully used in the crack growth stage.   \nThe strategy of combining a fracture mechanics computer code and an existing residual stress model \nshould also work for fastener holes with cold expansion effect. AFGROW is capable of taking the bearing \nload into account when calculating the stress intensity factors. This part of work is currently in progress. \nFor the part-life cold expanded cases, the prediction was less clear and required separate correlation for \neach level of pre-fatigue. The scatter in the test data, primarily in the different lengths and growth rates of \nthe separate corner cracks for each specimen, made the prediction work difficult. While correlation was \nprimarily made with regard to the dominant crack, this was not necessarily representative of the crack \ngrowth for the whole specimen. In this study, we have used the life to initiate a 0.5 mm crack after the \npart-life Cx as the starting point of the AFGROW prediction work. The prediction routine is the same as \nfor the cold expansion at build case. Details of the prediction results     \nIn general, the test program is believed to have been successful in demonstrating that useful life \nimprovements can be obtained when cold expansion is applied at various stages in the fatigue life of a \ncomponent that is loaded under an aircraft representative loading spectrum. The life prediction analysis is \npromising, with quite reasonable correlation in crack growth life for the 0%Cx and 25%Cx groups but \ngenerally becoming un-conservative as the amount of pre-fatigue cycles increased [26]. \n \n \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1249-1257.

Conclusions \nPart-life cold expansion provides significant life extension compared to a non-cold expanded (NCx) \nbaseline life. This applies for all pre-fatigue levels from 25% up to 75%. The life improvement factor \n(LIF) for the total fatigue life ranged from 3.8 (25% Cx) down to 2.2 (75% Cx). The 25% pre-fatigue \nlevel Cx returned the greatest improvement in both total life and crack nucleation life (Nai). \nThere was a significant and steady decrease in the life to initiation a crack from the 25%Cx specimens to \nthe 75%Cx specimens. This was possibly due to some small cracks not being completely removed by the \ncold expansion and reaming process. However, for the Cx at build specimens cracks initiated slightly \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1249-1257. Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n12 \n \nquicker than both the 25%Cx and 50%Cx groups, even when the \u2018baseline\u2019 effect of the Cx process was \nconsidered by subtracting the pre-fatigue life from the part-life specimens\u2019 initiation life. \nThe benefits of cold expansion were due primarily to the decrease in crack propagation rate in the early \ncrack growth stage (0.5\u20131.5 mm). For these narrow-width specimens, the life improvement is mainly in \nthe initiation of a detectable crack with only marginal improvements in the longer crack growth life.  \nFor all specimens, the critical cracks were at the mandrel entry face where the residual compressive \nstresses were lower compared to the mandrel exit face. \nWhen the benefit is measured by the life improvement factor (LIF), open hole specimens can predict the \nbenefits of cold expansion in the low-load transfer joints if the degree of cold expansion is the same. \nHowever, this conclusion may not hold for the mid-load or high-load transfer joints when significant \nsecondary bending is present. \nThe strategy of splitting fatigue life into two stages and the proposed prediction method worked well. For \nthe plain and Cx at build cases, the predictions agreed well with the tests in the two crack growth stages, \nNad and Np.  \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are grateful to QinetiQ (formerly Defense & Evaluation Research Agency) for supporting the \nfatigue test.
