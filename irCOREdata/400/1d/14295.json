Yet despite the popularity of CBI material, there is a gap in\nunderstanding of the relationship between multimedia and learning. Kozma (1994) argues\n17\nH\/tendra Pillay et 0\/ Personalizing the design of computer-based instruction to enhance learning\nthat any understanding of the relationship between media and learning must be grounded\nin cognitive and social processes associated with knowledge construction. Due to a lack of\nunderstanding of the relationship between learning and multimedia, the incentive for\ndeveloping CBI packages has been the innovative alternative in information technology for\npresenting instructional material rather than learning theories (Ambron and Hooper,\n1990). Hence, Hedberg, Harper and Brown (1993) have called for a closer examination of\nways in which information is accessed and processed in current learning packages as a\nbasis for designing CBI packages for effective learning outcomes.\nMany available CBI packages claim advantages such as providing increased accessibility,\nimmediate feedback, interactive learning, and a more flexible learning environment. These\nconsiderations are often dealt with in a physical sense which does contribute to enhanced\nlearning, but they fail to address cognitive aspects. For example, flexibility and learner\ncontrol is seen as an option for the learner to select what and when to learn (Reeves, 1993).\nSuch options do not allow for cognitive flexibility where individuals can choose instructional\nformats which are congruent with their preferred way of perceiving and processing\ninformation. Similarly, navigation within CBI is often not aligned to cognitive processes\nassociated with making connections between the learning processes and the content, or\nconcerned with the impact of different navigation systems on cognitive capacity and how it\naffects individuals' ability to access and process information (Hedberg et al, 1993). It is\nargued by Upitis (1990) and Farrow (1993) that many of these perceived benefits may in fact\nbe better achieved through traditional material than contrived use of technology-based\nlearning environments. Given the lack of sufficient research on the role of cognition and\nlearning in the design of CBI material, there are two related issues that are of interest with\nrespect to this paper. The first issue is the effect of individuals' preferred cognitive styles on\nlearning; the second is concerned with cognitive load effects of reconciling CBI material that\nis incongruent with their preferred cognitive styles when learning.\nLearning and preferred cognitive styles\nCurrent literature on learning suggests that it is an active, constructive, cognitive and social\nprocess by which the learner strategically manages the available cognitive, physical and\nsocial resources to construct knowledge (Shuell, 1988). Such construction requires\nindividuals to direct attention to relevant aspects of the given information and relate it to\nprevious experiences and knowledge, that is, to transform the information. Individuals\naccess and process information differently, so that the success of any transformation\nprocess may be enhanced by the opportunities individuals have to access and process\ninformation in their preferred styles.\nPreferred cognitive style is an individual's characteristic and consistent approach to\norganizing and processing information. Keefe (1979, 4) defined cognitive style as\n'characteristic cognitive, affective, and physiological behaviours that serve as relatively\nstable indicators of how learners perceive, interact with, and respond to the learning\nenvironment'. Cognitive style needs to be distinguished from cognitive strategies: a style is\nconsidered to be a fairly fixed characteristic of an individual, while strategies are methods\nof coping with information which may be incongruent with the individual's preferred style\n(Riding and Cheema, 1991). Cognitive styles have been investigated by many researchers,\nresulting in a myriad of theories and cognitive-style types. A comprehensive analysis of the\n18\nALT-] Volume 6 Number 2\nvarious labels, descriptors, classifications, and methods of assessment by Riding and\nCheema (1991) led to the formation of two principal cognitive style groups: the Wholist-\nAnalytic (WA) and the Verbal-Imagery (VI) dimensions. The WA continuum represents the\nmanner in which individuals process information, either in whole or in parts; the VI\ndimension characterizes individuals who are inclined to represent information verbally or\nin mental images. The two dimensions are independent of each other in that the position of\nindividuals on the WA dimension does not affect their position on the VI dimension.\nIndividuals may have a single cognitive style or be bi-dimensional which is how the\nmajority of people are. Bi-dimensional groups include Wholist\/Verbalizer, Wholist\/Imager,\nAnalytic\/Verbalizer and Analytic\/Imager.\nEvidence from research on the effect of cognitive styles on learning suggests that cognitive-\nstyle characteristics such as perception and processing of information enhance learning\noutcomes (Rush and Moore, 1991; Riding and Sadler-Smith, 1992; Riding and Douglas,\n1993; Riding and Caine, 1993). Although most of these studies were conducted using\nconventional instruction, it is plausible to assume that similar outcomes may eventuate\nwhen using CBI. The above studies argue that optimum learning outcomes are obtained\nwhen the instructional material can be transferred readily to learners' personal modes of\nrepresentation. More specifically, studies investigating an individual's position on the\nWholist-Analytic dimension have found that it affects reading performance (Riding and\nMathias, 1991), learning from structured material (Riding and Sadler-Smith, 1992), and\noccupational stress (Borg and Riding, 1993).\nAlthough individuals have preferred cognitive styles, they can use alternative styles by\nmaking a conscious choice (Riding and Dyer, 1980). For instance, imagery style is often\nused by Analytics to acquire a wholistic view where an image can be encompassing and a\nwhole. In addition, Verbalizers can translate pictures into words or semantic representa-\ntions, and Imagers can convert semantic information into mental pictures. Circumstances\nwhich force individuals to choose cognitive styles other than their habitual ones may\nrequire additional effort which may not assist in learning but may be necessary for\nreorganizing the given information. From a cognitive-load perspective (Sweller, 1989), it\nmay be argued that the ability to direct additional effort to aspects essential for learning is\ndetermined by the availability of sufficient cognitive resources. Our limited cognitive\nresources, if directed to extraneous activities, leave insufficient resources available for\nlearning to occur (Sweller, 1989; Halford, 1993; Pillay, 1997). Extraneous activities are\noften introduced because of poor instructional design, such as CBI material developed on\nexperts' mental models. Such CBI material mimics the network of knowledge displayed by\nexperts' memory systems (Jonassen, 1989). As such, it inhibits individuals from processing\ninformation in a manner familiar to them, and thus requires them to reorganize given\ninformation in a manner that is more readily accessible to them. Such extraneous processes\nare not necessary for learning but essential only because of the instructional format.\nConsequently, learners resort to employing strategies which are concerned with obtaining a\nsolution rather than learning about the structure of the problem (Sweller, 1989).\nUnderstanding a problem structure and categorizing it are essential parts of learning (Chi\net al, 1981). Matching instruction to preferred style frees up cognitive resources that can be\ndirected to making links between information currently attended to, information from\nprevious screens, and prior knowledge.\n19\nHitendra Pillay et al Personalizing the design of computer-based instruction to enhance learning\nThe recognition of individual learning preferences is increasingly becoming an important\nconsideration in the design and delivery of instruction (Dunn et al, 1985; Claxton and\nMurrell, 1987; Riding and Sadler-Smith, 1992). If individuals have their own habitual ways\nof perceiving, representing and structuring information for learning, then 'identifying a\nstudent's style and then providing instruction consistent with that style contributes to more\neffective learning' (Claxton and Murrell, 1987, 1). Even though there is a general accept-\nance by educators that students differ in how they perceive and process information, and\nalthough attempts to cater for this difference can be seen in the more traditional\ninstruction, it has not gained the same recognition in the design of CBI material (Pillay\nand Wilss, 1996).\nDesigning CBI to accommodate preferred cognitive styles\nThere are two principal considerations in designing instruction to accommodate preferred\ncognitive styles: the manner in which the information is formatted to allow easy access to\nthe issues presented, and how individuals process the given information.\nThe format involves the use of graphical images and\/or verbal (text) information. This\nVerbal-Imagery mix may affect the modes in which individuals represent information\nduring thinking. They may use mental images to represent given information or use verbal\nrepresentations, as thoughts can be articulated in words or pictures (Riding and Calvey,\n1993). Verbalizers prefer information presented as words or verbal associations, whereas\nImagers represent information better with mental pictures of given information. The\ndesign of each CBI screen should reflect the preference of the cognitive style being catered\nfor. Considerations include the ratio of text to graphics, the nature of the text information\n(very vivid narrative text would suit Imagers whereas a list of points would suit\nVerbalizers), and the nature of the information being presented. Procedural information is\noften serial and thus better presented in point form, whereas conceptual knowledge may\nrequire information from multiple sources. Similarly, the nature of images should be\nconsidered because images often are not complete in themselves and hence require\nadditional information, often in text form, to make them meaningful. In determining the\ndesign composition, it must be noted that it is not a case of either\/or in each of the above\nsituations, but of emphasis.\nRecent developments in information technology may help individuals construct realistic\ndynamic images by using simulated movements. Hidden details may be displayed by using\noverlays. Creative use of the technology, such as the use of layers to progressively build an\nimage, can be an effective method for learning from images. Images that are poorly\ndesigned often require supplementary text information. Such images may not benefit the\nImagers. Similarly, the formatting of text information can affect its benefit to Verbalizers.\nA number of options such as bullet points, narrative prose and voice-interactive systems\nmay be utilized.\nAccessibility is also influenced by the nature of subject content (Riding and Douglas, 1993).\nThere are certain types of content that lend themselves more favourably to certain cognitive\nstyles. Imagine learning architecture by reading text material only. The spatial nature of the\nsubject content would force individuals to engage in imagery to fully appreciate the spatial\nconcepts. In terms of content to be learned, Verbalizers cope better with understanding and\n20\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nrecall from prose passages which may contain unfamiliar information than Imagers who\nleam best from passages with few unfamiliar terms and which are descriptive and illustrated\n(Riding and Mathias, 1991). Even the design of the menus has potential for catering to\nImagers and Verbalizers. The use of icons may benefit the Imagers, whereas word\ncommands may benefit the Verbalizers. Hence the design of optimum instructional material\nto cater for either the Verbalizer or the Imager can be very involved.\nThe second issue is how individuals process information. Wholists tend to organize\ninformation into loosely clustered wholes so as to construct an overall understanding of\nthe given information. By contrast, Analytics tend to process information in clear-cut\nconceptual groupings, and often focus on one of these groupings at a time (Witkin et al,\n1977). They have the schema to integrate and construct meaning by firstly understanding\nthe various sub-groups, then combining them to obtain a big picture. Strengths for\nWholists include their ability to see the big picture of a situation and therefore have a\nbalanced view of the given information. However, if Wholists direct most of their cognitive\nresources to finding links between the various elements of the instruction, they may not\nhave sufficient resources to learn the whole picture. The down side for Wholists is that they\noften find it difficult to separate situations into parts and become analytical. Analytics can\ndecompose problems into separate parts and may quickly diagnose a problem, but they\nmay not be able to develop a big picture of the problem, that is, synthesize information.\nAusubel (1960) recognized that some individuals need to have an overview to assist them in\ntheir learning. Consequently, he developed the use of advance organizers. Advance\norganizers can be images or text, but it is the manner in which the information is structured\nthat assists the Wholist and Analytic to effectively process information. Satterly and Telfer\n(1979) provided evidence that the use of advanced organizers helped Wholists to develop a\nbig picture of given information rather than having to engage in search and construction\nprocesses from unfamiliarly structured information. Such a procedure may not benefit the\nAnalytic style person who seeks detailed and highly structured information to conceptual-\nize (Riding and Calvey, 1981). For the Analytics, consideration must be given to how the\ninformation is broken down to spread it over a number of screens and finally pull it\ntogether as a unit of information. However, maintaining information from a number of\nscreens can be cognitively demanding. Consideration must then be given to the complexity\nand amount of information that is spread over a number of screens or layers. Satterly and\nTelfer (1979) examined various advance organizers and found that a careful design may\nhelp different cognitive styles. They proposed three types of advance organizers: the linker,\nintegrator and the analyser.\nLiu and Reed (1994) argued that hypermedia-assisted instruction has the potential to\naccommodate requirements of different learning preferences. They found that learners\nchose different tools and learning aids when working in a hypermedia learning\nenvironment. Thus, structuring of information to suit different cognitive styles needs\ncareful consideration in the instructional design of CBI material.\nResearch design\nSince we know from the studies conducted by Riding and his colleagues that preferred\ncognitive styles exist, matching the style with the instructional format may enhance\n21\nH\/tendra Pilby et ol Personalizing the design of computer-based instruction to enhance learning\nlearning (Entwistle, 1981; Riding and Sadler-Smith, 1992). If students can access\ninformation in a format that matches their cognitive style, the need to reorganize in\naccordance with their preferred style prior to learning is not necessary. The elimination of\nthis step in information processing presumably reduces the cognitive load imposed by the\ntask and enhances performance (Sweller, 1989; Halford, 1993).\nThe two studies reported here were designed to investigate the effect of matching preferred\ncognitive styles to instructional format on learning outcomes. The first study involved a\nsmall sample and considered cognitive style as a single characteristic such as 'Wholist or\nImager', rather than a bi-dimensional one where the style is a combination of preferred\nstyle for perceiving and processing information. Also, the first study tested learning\noutcomes after only a single treatment session, which can be limiting (Reeves, 1993).The\nencouraging result of the first study prompted the second one. A larger sample allowed\nreliable statistical analysis. In addition, consideration was given to bi-dimensional cognitive\nstyles in order to establish the full impact of cognitive style which, as identified by Riding\n(1991), is a combination of both perception and processing preferences. Both studies\nadopted a quasi-experimental design involving four groups of students: Wholist\/Imager,\nWholist\/Verbalizer, Analytic\/Imager, Analytic\/Verbalizer. Each group was presented with\neither matched or mismatched instructional material which was developed to cater for each\nof the four cognitive styles. This resulted in eight treatment groups. Some of the\ncharacteristics considered in the design of instructional formats were advance organizers,\ntext-plus-diagrams versus text-plus-spreading information across a number of screens,\ndescriptive prose versus bullet points of specific information, and integrated diagrams\nversus diagrams of discrete parts.\nAll students were assessed for their preferred cognitive style using the Cognitive\" Style\nAssessment software (CSA). Details of the design and development of CSA can be found\nin Riding (1991). Cognitive-style assessment works on the basis of response times to a\nbattery of statements which are categorized into subsets, and a ratio for each subset is\ncalculated. The first subset measures the Verbal\/Imager dimension by asking conceptual\nand appearance recognition questions. The other two subsets in the CSA assess the\nWholist\/Analytic dimension. The first of these two subsets involves judging overall\nsimilarity of complex geometrical shapes. The second subset requires a degree of\ndisembedding of simple shapes within complex geometrical figures. A detailed discussion\nof the rationale for CSA design can be found in Riding and Cheema (1991) and Riding\nand Douglas (1993). Figure 1 illustrates the organization of the experiments.\nStudy I\nSample\nSeventy-one students from a second-year nursing course at Queensland University of\nTechnology participated in the study. Students who were defaulted to mismatched Imager\ninstruction did not complete the tasks and were excluded from the analysis. The sample\nwhen distributed into the eight groups resulted in very small numbers of students in each\ngroup, hence the data is discussed qualitatively.\nMaterial\nThe topic 'Compartment Syndrome' from the second-year nursing programme was used\n22\nALT-] Volume 6 Number 2\n>\nfirst sessior\nCSA\nCognitive Style Assessment\nI\nWholist\/lmager\n(m) (mm)\nStudents login\nother\nsessions\nInstructional Phase\nI\nWholist\/Verbaliser\n(m) (mm)\nI\ni\nWholist\/lmager\n(m) (mm)\nBiodata ai\n1\nid security checks\ni P\nAnalytic\/lmager\n(m) (mm)\nAnalyticA\/erbaliser\n(m) (mm)\nI i I\nI\nTest Phase\nT\nWholistA\/erbaliser\n(m) (mm)\ni\n1 Defaulted to respective CSA\n\\ Test format\nI i\nAnalytic\/lmager\n(m) (mm)\nAnalyticA\/erbaliser\n(m) (mm)\n1 1 i\nv.\n| Resulting data file\nFigure I: Organization of the experiments (m = matched cognitive style; mm = mismatched\ncognitive style)\nfor the study. The topic was new to the students, so interference from prior knowledge was\nnot a concern. The content material was analysed to determine the optimum structure for\neach of the four cognitive styles. The mismatched instruction was the style on the opposite\nend of the continuum. For example, the mismatched instruction for a Wholist style would\nbe Analytic-style instruction. All instructional material had the same subject content but\ndifferent formats. ToolBook authoring software was used to develop the instructional\nmaterial, which was loaded on the network in an undergraduate computer laboratory.\nDifferences in design of the instructional materials for the four cognitive styles is apparent.\nThe 'linker' advance organizer for the Wholist lesson contained information about the\nentire lesson, while the 'analytic' advance organizer for the analytic lesson was fragmented\nand contained information relating to specific parts of the lesson. The wholist screen con-\ntained more than just this section of information as it also moved onto the next part, the\nneurovascular assessment, thus allowing students in this preferred cognitive style to\ndevelop a big picture of the given information.\nThe 'imager' advance organizer was the only one that included a graphic depiction of\nvarious parts in the Compartment Syndrome topic, while Verbalizers were presented with\ntext information in their advance organizer. Because content material involved understand-\ning spatial location and relationships with adjacent components, diagrams were contained\nin all instructional formats except that of the Verbalizer. Thus it was necessary to make a\ndistinction between the groups regarding the inclusion of diagrams. Wholists received a\ncomplete presentation of the components of a compartment, a diagram showing the\ncompartments and what compartment syndrome is, as well as information regarding the\nlocation of compartments. Analytics were presented with three separate screens containing\n23\nHitendra Pillay et al Personalizing the design of computer-based instruction to enhance learning\nthe same information which had graphical depictions, but these were of the separate\ncomponents of a compartment rather than the overall view of a compartment which the\nWholist lesson contained. Verbalizers were presented with the information in text form only,\nwhile Imagers had a single diagram that featured prominently in this section. Thus\nconsideration of the requirements of each cognitive style was clearly evident in each lesson.\nThe test items were made up of seven recall-type questions based on statements requiring a\ntrue or false response, listing specific terminology, and multiple-choice questions. There\nwere two explanation questions which required synthesis of details relating to the\ncomponents of a compartment. For the problem-solving task, students were presented with\na description of a situation involving compartment syndrome, and were asked to\ndetermine what manifestations of compartment syndrome might be evident and to outline\nprocedures for further assessment of the situation. There was only one problem-solving\ntype question. All marking and scoring of the test task was done in consultation with a\nnursing lecturer.\nCSA classifications\nPreferred cognitive style was calculated on the basis of the individual's highest cognitive\nstyle ratios from the two dimensions Wholist\/Analytic and Verbalizer\/Imager. This was\ndetermined by finding the central point for the Wholist\/Analytic ratio which was 1.19, and\nthe Verbalizer\/Imager ratio which was 1.04. Students scoring higher than 1.19 on the\nWholist\/Analytic dimension were classified as Analytics, and those scoring less than 1.19\nas Wholists. Similarly for the Verbalizer\/Imager ratio: greater than 1.04 were classified as\nImagers, and less than 1.04 as Verbalizers. The intermediate group stipulated by Riding\n(1991) was not considered mainly because of the small sample size. Using these\nsubdivisions, a student with a Wholist\/Analytic ratio of 0.91 and a Verbalizer\/Imager ratio\nof 1.29 would have a preferred cognitive style of Wholist\/Imager. However the stronger\nratio for this student is 1.29 which is in the Verbalizer\/Imager dimension. As this is greater\nthan the central point (1.04), the preferred cognitive style is Imager.\nProcedure\nStudents were tested during their normal tutorial times. They were informed about the\nprocess of working through the CSA. This was followed by the lesson, and they were then\nasked to log on. At the log-on screen they entered their identification number, age, and\ngender. Having completed this, they worked through the CSA, which took approximately\n15 minutes, and depending on their CSA result students were defaulted, alternating\nbetween matched and mismatched instructional material. They had no control over the\nchoice of instructional material. Students studied the lesson, taking as long as they needed,\nthen proceeded to the test phase. Once in the test phase, they could not return to the\ninstructional material. The whole process took approximately 45 minutes per student.\nThe matched and mismatched groups for each cognitive style were compared on the\nfollowing performance measures: percentage correct on recall questions, sophistication of\nexplanations and successful problem-solving skills. A comparison of the overall\nperformance of the matched and mismatched cognitive styles groups was also made.\nResults and discussion\nA comparison of performance of the matched and mismatched instructional groups on all\ntest tasks, and for each of the four cognitive styles, is summarized in Table 1. The result\n_\nALT-] Volume 6 Number 2\nindicates that when Wholists and Analytics received matched instruction, they performed\nbetter than when these groups were presented with mismatched instruction. However, in\nthe case of the Verbalizers and the Imagers, the results did not support the use of matched\ninstructional material. The mismatched Verbalizer group performed better in two of the\nthree test tasks. Since the Imager group did not have any students presented with the\nmismatched instructional material, it was not possible to make any comparison.\nIndividual cognitive styles\nn=\nPercentage <\nTest tasks\nRecall\nExplanation\nProblem-\nsolving\nWholist\nm mm\n9 9 '\nm\n14\n:orrect on individual\n71 66 74\n100 66 71\n33 30 53\nAnalytic\nmm\n10\ntasks\n68\n20\n17\nPercentage correct on all three tasks\n66 60 69 55\nm\n12\n93\n65\n55\n50\nVerbal\nmm\n10\n57\n43\n34\n88\nImager\nm mm\n5 0*\n68\n25\n58\n64\n* Students who were identified as mismatched Imagers did not complete the test phase.\nCombined\ncognitive\nstyles\nm mm\n40 29\n71 66\n64 50\n43 33\n66 62\nTable I: Comparison of matched and mismatched instructional formats on performance by test tasks\nand by cognitive styles (m = matched; mm = mismatched)\nIn light of the small sample size for each cognitive style, Table 1 has been collapsed to show\nthe total effect of matched and mismatched instructional material on performance. A\ncomparison of the total sample revealed that the matched group achieved a higher\npercentage of correct responses for each task-type than the mismatched group. It may be\nplausible to suggest that a trend appears to exist when CBI material is matched to\nindividuals' preferred cognitive styles as students performed better (66 per cent correct)\nthan those who received mismatched instruction (62 per cent). This concurs with the\nargument presented by Claxton and Murrell (1987) using conventional instruction, that\nlearning can be enhanced by matching the instruction to individuals' preferred cognitive\nstyles.\nThe better performance by the mismatched Verbalizers (who received an Imager lesson)\nmay be due to variance caused by the type of information. Riding and Douglas (1993) have\nargued that verbal descriptive information which is easier to visualize can be recalled easily\nby Imagers. For example, to appreciate the way in which increased pressure can affect\ndifferent parts of the human anatomy, cross-sectional images illustrating the spatial\nlocation of muscles, blood vessels and bones are needed. It is probably easier to imagine\nthe cross-sectional images than to remember a long list of textual information. Thus the\nnature of subject matter may also influence the manner in which individuals process\ninformation. In the case of the Verbalizer group in this study, it is plausible to suggest that\nthe nature of the information favoured Imager style, and therefore the mismatched group\n25\nH\/tendra Pillay et al Personalizing the design of computer-based instruction to enhance learning\nperformed better. Support for the above contention has also been raised by Riding and\nCaine (1993).\nThe other interesting finding was the response to each test task. The size of the difference\nin performance between matched and mismatched groups was 14 per cent on the\nexplanation task, followed by 10 per cent on problem solving, and finally 2 per cent on\nrecall problems. This suggests that presenting information matched to cognitive styles may\nbenefit certain types of tasks more than others. However, further studies need to\nundertaken to investigate the interaction between the task types and cognitive styles, and in\nterms of CBI design, further work with a larger sample.\nStudy 2\nThis study aimed at refining the processes used in Study 1 and obtaining a large enough\nsample to allow statistical analysis. The individual cognitive style in Study 1 was deter-\nmined on the basis of the strongest preferences out of the four styles. This was simplistic\nbecause we know that both cognitive style dimensions are essential to fully appreciate the\neffect of cognitive styles on learning outcomes. Furthermore, the argument that a single\nsession is not sufficient treatment to make any conclusive statement about the results\n(Reeves, 1993) prompted the design of the second study to include four sessions over four\nweeks. This would provide learners with sufficient time to respond meaningfully to the\ntreatments which in turn would allow more reliable conclusions to be drawn.\nStudy 2 also adopted a quasi-experimental design involving four groups Wholist\/\nVerbalizer, Wholist\/Imager, Analytic\/Imager and Analytic\/Verbalizer. These groups were\npresented with instructional material that either matched or mismatched their preferred\ncognitive style, making up eight treatment groups. The mismatched group were presented\nwith their opposite cognitive style. For example, the opposite cognitive style for an\nAnalytic\/Verbalizer is Wholist\/Imager. The instructional materials were developed in\naccordance with Riding's (1991) four cognitive styles. Characteristics considered in the\ndesign of instructional materials included advance organizers, text-plus-diagram versus\ntext-plus-text, integrated diagrams versus diagrams of discrete parts, and descriptive prose\nversus bullet points of specific points.\nCSA classification\nEach student's preferred cognitive style was determined by the CSA software developed by\nRiding (1991) in order to obtain a ratio for the Wholist\/Analytic and Verbalizer\/Imager\ndimensions. On the Wholist\/Analytic continuum a score equal to or greater than 1.35 was\nconsidered as Wholist, and a score of less than or equal to 1.03 as Analytic, with those\nfalling in between 1.03 and 1.35 as intermediate. On the Verbalizer\/Imager continuum,\nVerbalizers were equal to or less than 0.99, and Imagers equal to or more than 1.09. The\nintermediate groups are those that cannot be definitely classified into one of the four bi-\ndimensional cognitive styles and were not included in the study.\nIn accordance with the literature, it was hypothesized that students who received\nmismatched instruction would engage in extraneous search and reorganization processes\nresulting in poorer performance. Students' overall performance, and performance on the\nfour individual test tasks for matched and mismatched instructional material, were\ncompared. The total time taken to accomplish the tasks was also recorded for comparison.\n26\nALT-] Volume 6 Number 2\nThe second analysis was designed to investigate whether the nature of the subject content\nfavoured any particular cognitive style (see Riding and Douglas, 1993). The final analysis\ninvestigated whether there was any relationship between the nature of the test tasks and\ncognitive styles.\nSample\nA hundred and thirty-four undergraduate students enrolled in the Digital Communications\ncourse used for the study. The sample sizes reported include only those students who had\ncompleted the task fully. Some students did not attend all CBI sessions. The students were\nallocated to four groups according to their preferred cognitive styles: Wholist\/Imager,\nWholist\/Verbalizer, Analytic\/Imager and Analytic\/Verbalizer.\nMaterial\nComputer-based instructions, corresponding to each of the four cognitive learning styles\nwere developed for four specific topics: Synchronisation, Multiplexing and Multiple\nAccess, Spread-Spectrum Techniques and Layered Protocols. One topic was presented\neach week over a four-week period. All instructional formats on each topic had the same\nsubject content, but varied in presentation styles. For example, Wholist\/Imagers received a\ncomplete presentation of the different configurations of the Multiple Access Algorithm\n(MAA), a comprehensive diagram, and some text information regarding the functions of\nthe various components. Analytic\/Imagers were presented with three separate screens\ncontaining the same information which also included diagrammatic depictions, but they\nwere presented as separate aspects of the MAA system rather than the overall integrated\nview which was the format of the Wholist\/Imager lesson. Thus students viewed a step-by-\nstep, rather than a complete piece of information. The Wholist\/Verbalizers and\nAnalytic\/Verbalizers, because they represent information in words during thinking, were\npresented with text containing the equivalent information. The nature of the text\ninformation also varied. It was presented either as descriptive prose or just bullet points.\nDescriptive instruction allows individuals to construct whole pictures whereas bullet points\npresent details of specific points. Thus consideration of the requirements of each cognitive\nstyle is clearly evident in each lesson. Again, the authoring software was ToolBook.\nThe instructional material had a learning and a test phase. The learning phase consisted of\nan average of 25 screens of instructional material which students could move through\nbackward and forward as they wished. The test phase consisted of tasks in recall, labelling,\nexplanation and problem solving. Scores on each task, as well as the time taken for the\nlearning and test phases were recorded. Recall consisted of five questions in each session,\nand it required students to recall the words which linked individual parts to overall\nconcepts. The labelling task required students to fill in missing blanks on a given diagram;\neach session had five missing items which the students had to fill in. Explanation was a\nsingle question in each session. It required students to recall explanatory type of\ninformation. Problem solving was also a single question in each session; a hypothetical\nscenario was presented to students, and they had to analyse the given situation, and design\nand compute a solution.\nThe CSA programme and the instructional material were installed on the university\nnetwork so that five computer laboratories could be used simultaneously to conduct the\nexperiment. The test data and the time taken to complete the task were recorded each week\n27\nHitendra Pillay et al Personalizing the design of computer-based instruction to enhance learning\nand stored on a secure database within the university network system which is inaccessible\nto students.\nProcedure\nThe procedure was similar to that of Study 1. Students were tested during their normal\nlecture times which are typically three-hour sessions. After a two-hour lecture, students\nwere asked to study the remainder of the subject content via CBI. They were informed\nabout the process of working through the CSA, followed by the lesson and the test tasks.\nStudents were tested in five computer labs, all at the same time. The instructor supervised\nthem, and instructed them not to cheat or look at information on other screens. Following\nthe introduction, students were asked to log on to the system. At the log-on screen they\nentered their identification number, age, and gender. On entering their ID number during\nthe first session, they were presented with the CSA software to measure their preferred\ncognitive style. The CSA took approximately 15 minutes, and depending on the result\nstudents were defaulted to their respective instructional material. Students' CSA results\nwere saved in a file with their ID numbers, thus for all subsequent sessions the computer\nidentified their preferred styles from their ID numbers and logged them on to the same\ncognitive-style instructional formats. The computer was programmed to allocate students\nin each cognitive style group by alternating them between matched and mismatched\ninstructional material, thus giving no control to students on choice of instructional\nmaterial. Students studied the lesson, taking as long as they needed, navigating backward\nand forward. When they were satisfied with their learning, they proceeded to the test phase.\nOnce they had exited the test phase, they could not return to the instructional material.\nResponses to test items were recorded for each student and for each sub-task. The whole\nprocess took approximately 70 minutes per session. Students had to participate in four\nsessions, one every week over four weeks.\nA two-factor non-orthogonal design using an analysis of unweighted means was used to\nanalyse the data (Keppel, 1991). This analysis was necessary due to the presence of\nunequal sample sizes.\nResults\nStudents' scores on test tasks for matched and mismatched cognitive styles groups were\ncompared (see Table 2). There was no significant difference between the two groups on total\nscores: F(l,119)=2.795, p<.05. Comparing scores for matched and mismatched groups on\nindividual sub-tasks also revealed no significant difference. However, the mean score of the\nmatched group on all sub-tasks was consistently better than that of the mismatched group.\nThe above performance was also achieved in less time than the mismatched group: the mean\ntime taken over the four CBI sessions for the matched group was 265.4 minutes compared to\n283.3 minutes for the mismatched group. Hence, it may be plausible to suggest that there\nmight be a pattern (although not significant) in favour of the matched group.\nHowever, while there was no significant difference between the matched and mismatched\ngroups, a significant difference was found to exist between the four learning styles:\nF(3,119)= 4.450, p<.05. In considering the mean scores of each cognitive style, it is evident\nthat the Wholist\/Verbalizer group performed better than all other groups. There was no\nsignificant interaction between the different cognitive styles and the matched and\nmismatched treatments: F(3,119)= 0.979, p<.05.\n28\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nTotal Recall\n% %\nMatched instructional format\nAl\nAV\nWl\nWV\nTotal\nMismatched\nAl\nAV\nWl\nWV\nTotal 64.5\n723\n64.9\n67.2\n73.6\n69.2\n80.8\n74.5\n77.7\n88.8\n79.0\ninstructional format\n67.6\n64.3\n56.2\n73.2\n74.9\n79.0\n77.7\n63.4\n79.6\n73.2\nLabell-\ning\n%\n80.6\n713\n77.1\n81.1\n77.4\n77.8\n72.9\n63.0\n810\n50.5\nExplan-\nation\n%\n58.5\n54.8\n49.7\n63.1\n56.3\n50.5\n48.5\n47.4\n60.1\n43.5\nProblem\nsolving\n%\n54.6\n43.3\n48.8\n58.4\n50.6\n49.8\n41.3\n36.2\n45.6\n1810\nLearn\ntime\nmin.\n189.7\n177.5\n148.6\n183.4\n175.7\n2005\n164.6\n180.3\n1814\n101.8\nTest\ntime\nmin.\n100.2\n911\n77.7\n917\n91.4\n1013\n104.5\n100.3\n98.4\n283.3\nTotal\ntime\nmin.\n289.9\n269.5\n226.3\n276.1\n265.4\n3018\n269.1\n280.6\n280.8\n60\nn\n20\n20\n15\n12\n67\n21\n15\n16\n8\nTable 2: Mean percentage score on test tasks, learning time, test time and total time for the four\ncognitive styles\nAn analysis of the effect of cognitive learning styles on each test task is summarized in\nTable 2.

The difference was not significant on problem solving:\nF(3,126)=2.58, p<.05. It appears that certain test tasks were favoured by certain cognitive\nstyles. Considering the mean scores of each cognitive style, it is evident that the\nWholist\/Verbalizer group performed best on the test tasks followed by the Analytic\/Imager\ngroup.\nDiscussion\nThe lack of any significant difference between the matched and mismatched groups may be\ndue to a combination of factors. In the second study, it is plausible to argue that the lecture\nsessions presented just prior to the CBI experiment could have influenced the result. The\nexperimental design allowed no control over the lecture session which was necessary for the\ncourse requirements stipulated by the University. The other consideration in both the\nstudies was the need not to make the instructional material too different as it would open\nsocial-justice debates within the University. It would have been better if a whole non-credit\ncourse could have been identified so that the problems of assessment and equity did not\nlimit the design of instructional material. Perhaps a more robust design dealing with\ncomplete topics rather than part of a topic, free of policy implications and using multi-\nmedia (audio, video, text, diagrams), would result in larger differences between the\nmatched and mismatched groups, so reaching significant levels. Support for the above can\nbe seen in Liu and Reed (1994) who argue that hypermedia learning environments may\ngreatly enhance the potential to accommodate individual learning preferences. Neverthe-\nless, the results of each sub-task consistently showed enhanced performance by the\nmatched group which also achieved this in less time. This suggests potential for further\ninvestigation.\n29\nH\/'tendra Pillay et al Personalizing the design of computer-based instruction to enhance learning\nAs noted by Riding and Douglas (1993), the manner in which we perceive and process\ninformation can be influenced by the subject content. The subject, Digital Communica-\ntions, required students not only to understand the details involved in each of the four\ntopics, but also to have an overview of how the details fit together within each topic and\nwith other topics. Similar requirements were noted in Study 1, where explanation was\nemphasized. Both subject contents sought relational understanding. Such learning\nfacilitates the transfer of knowledge to applications, which is what the problem-solving\ntask in this study tested. The results suggest that Wholist\/Verbalizers performed better\nthan the other cognitive styles. This perhaps is due to the advance organizers being\npresented as a single unit of information which assisted students in reading the detailed\nexplanations and in making relational links between concepts and prior knowledge. The\nexplanatory value of the diagrams used in the Imager instruction must have been low\n(Mayer and Gallini, 1990). The subject content required students to be able to identify the\nvarious components, understand their functions, and reason through the protocol\nnecessary to design systems. Thus the findings of this study, to some extent, support the\nargument put forward by Riding and Douglas (1993) that subject types have an affinity\nwith certain cognitive styles, and acknowledge the need to consider the nature of the\nsubject matter in designing personalized CBI instruction.\nThe analysis of test tasks showed a significant difference between the cognitive style groups\nand the test tasks, suggesting that certain cognitive styles may suit certain types of test\ntasks. This result was consistent in both the studies. The finding is also consistent with the\nargument of Riding and Calvey (1981) that the effect of cognitive style on performance\ndepends on the nature of the task. On recall tasks, the Wholist\/Verbalizers and Analytic\/\nImagers did better than Wholist\/Imagers and Analytic\/Verbalizers. This may be because\nthe recall tasks required words which connected parts of information to the overall\nconcepts. Such words are easily recognized where the instruction provides opportunities to\nsee the overall concept as well as the details as found in Wholist\/Verbalizers and\nAnalytic\/Imagers. The Wholist\/Verbalizers and the Analytic\/Imagers, in fact, consistently\nperformed better than the other groups. This may be due to the design of the instructional\nmaterial which influenced the type of learning outcomes desired (analytic\/quantitative or\nwholist\/qualitative). The design of the problem task also favoured the Wholist\/Verbalizers\nbecause it concentrated on verbal answers and those that required an overall\nunderstanding rather than any detailed analysis.\nConclusion\nThe studies found that there may be potential for further research in considering\npersonalizing CBI material. The findings also concur with previous findings that subject\ncontent may have an affinity with certain cognitive styles. This prompts research into the\nnature of subject content: what makes a subject more or less suited to certain cognitive\nstyle? Although the CBI in these studies used linear presentation, there are more\npossibilities to improve the CBI material such as the use of voice which may assist the\nVerbalizers, animations which may help the Imagers, and hotspots for Analytics who may\nwish to seek detailed information. The design of many CBI materials can benefit greatly by\nconsidering the needs for personal learning styles.\n30\nALT-] Volume 6 Number 2\nAcknowledgements\nThe above studies were made possible by support from Queensland .University of\nTechnology's research programmes.
