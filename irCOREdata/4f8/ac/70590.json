From the WMAP three-year results for the \u039bCDM model,\n\u2126DM\/\u2126B = 5.65\u00b10.58 [1]. In conventional models of baryogenesis and dark matter the\nphysical mechanisms behind the respective densities are typically unrelated [2]. For\nexample, this is generally true in the case where dark matter originates from freeze-out\nof a thermal equilibrium density of weakly-interacting particles. As there is no reason\nto expect the values of \u2126B and \u2126DM from entirely unrelated physical processes to be\nwithin an order of magnitude of each other, there is an implicit acceptance of either a\nremarkable coincidence or an undefined anthropic selection mechanism.\nA more obvious interpretation of the baryon-to-dark matter ratio is that the densi-\nties originate via a common physical mechanism. Such an interpretation could provide\na strong principle by which to identify both a viable particle physics model and the ex-\nplanation of dark matter and baryogenesis within that model. Should a given particle\nphysics model naturally have within its structure a common mechanism for the origin\nof dark matter and baryogenesis, then both the model and the associated mechanism\nwould be strongly favoured.\nIn this paper we will apply this principle to the minimal supersymmetric (SUSY)\nStandard Model (MSSM) [3] to determine the most likely cold dark matter particle and\nmechanism for baryogenesis. We will consider the MSSM extended by right-handed\n(RH) neutrino superfields in order to generate neutrino masses (\u03bdMSSM).\nIt has recently been proposed that the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) could\nbe a RH sneutrino [4]. The scenario discussed in [4] considered the case where the\nneutrino masses are of Dirac-type, with no SUSY mass term for the RH neutrino\nsuperfield. Since the RH sneutrino mass is purely due to soft SUSY breaking, the RH\nsneutrino can then be the LSP. This model may have striking consequences for collider\nphenomenology: the next-to-lightest SUSY particle of the MSSM sector (MSSM-LSP)\nwould have collider signatures identical to a conventional LSP, but could be a coloured\nor charged particle instead of a neutralino [4].\n1\nThe dark matter RH sneutrinos considered in [4] originated from the decay of\nthermal equilibrium MSSM particles, although the possibility of dark matter being\ndue to a RH sneutrino condensate was also noted. In the following we will argue that\nthe baryon-to-dark matter ratio favours a RH sneutrino condensate as the explanation\nof cold dark matter. This will be true if there exists a mechanism within the \u03bdMSSM\nby which a baryon density can be generated which is naturally of the same magnitude\nas the RH sneutrino dark matter density. We will show that this can be achieved via\nAffleck-Dine (AD) leptogenesis [5] along the (HuL)\n2 flat direction [6, 7]. Large CDM\nand\/or baryonic isocurvature perturbations are possible in this framework, depending\nof the structure of the inflation model.\nThere exist other models which attempt to explain the baryon-to-dark matter ratio.\nThe possibility that sneutrinos can play the role of dark matter has been considered\nin [8, 9]. In [8] a mixed sneutrino dark matter particle with a large RH sneutrino\ncomponent was considered. In this model thermal relic densities of sneutrinos and\nbaryons of the right magnitude can be generated from an initial lepton asymmetry.\nThis requires that the weak scale has the right magnitude in order to annihilate the\nsneutrino asymmetry sufficiently. In [9] a RH sneutrino condensate was considered in\na lepton-number conserving renormalizable extension of the MSSM. This model shares\nthe features of Affleck-Dine leptogenesis and RH sneutrino condensates with the model\nproposed here, but employs a different AD leptogenesis mechanism and is dynamically\nunrelated. In this model the number density of dark matter particles is related to\nthe number density of baryons via lepton number conservation. This type of relation,\nbased on a conserved charge, requires a very light LSP of a few GeV in mass, which\nis disfavoured in gravity-mediated SUSY breaking models. In [10] the possibility that\nthe late-decaying Q-balls which form along d = 6 flat directions of the MSSM during\nAD baryogenesis could produce dark matter neutralinos was considered. This model\nalso relates the number density of baryons and neutralinos and as a result requires\na neutralino mass \u2248 2 GeV, which is experimentally ruled out in the context of the\nMSSM. Recently a solution to this problem was proposed where naturally light axinos\nfrom the decay of MSSM Q-balls could account for the baryon-to-dark matter ratio\n2\n[11]. An earlier SUSY model is based on the CP-violating decay of a condensate of\nmassive scalar particles to baryons and dark matter [12]. Non-SUSY models also exist.\nIn [13], a model based on the universal see-saw mechanism was proposed in which the\nbaryon number is related to the number of dark matter particles via baryon number\nconservation and the decay of TeV-scale quarks to right-handed Majorana neutrinos\nof mass \u2248 1 GeV. A similar mechanism was proposed in [14]. In [15] it was proposed\nthat the dark matter particle number density could be related to the baryon number\ndensity if the dark matter particles carry baryon number and the annihilation cross-\nsections for dark matter baryons and anti-baryons differ. Eariler models include those\nbased on electroweak baryogenesis [16] and anomalous (B + L)-violation [17].\nA striking feature of all of these models (with the exception of [8]) is that they\nstrictly relate the number of baryon to the number of dark matter particles via a\nconserved charge. In the case of SUSY models this results in unfavourably small LSP\nmasses. In contrast, the model we present here is not based on a conserved charge but\ninstead is purely dynamical in nature, based on the similar dynamics of the seperate\nflat direction fields responsible for the baryon asymmetry and dark matter density.\nInformation from accelerators, in particular evidence of SUSY and the nature of the\nLSP from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and astronomical observations, such\nas evidence of isocurvature perturbations, could in principle distinguish between the\npossible models.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we discuss dark matter from a RH\nsneutrino condensate and AD leptogenesis from the (HuL)\n2 flat direction. We calculate\nthe baryon-to-dark matter ratio and the range of parameters for which the densities\nof dark matter and baryons are similar. In Section 3 we calculate the magnitude of\nthe CDM and baryon isocurvature perturbations expected in the model. In Section 4\nwe present our conclusions.\n3\n2 Cold Dark Matter and the Baryon Asymmetry\nfrom d = 4 Flat Directions\nThe key feature of the \u03bdMSSM is that both the baryon asymmetry and cold dark\nmatter can originate from condensates of scalar fields along flat directions of the\nscalar potential. In particular, if the flat directions responsible are both lifted by\nnon-renormalisable superpotential terms of the same dimension, then we will show\nthat the baryon and dark matter densities are automatically related.\nSince the RH sneutrino is a gauge singlet, it is natural to consider a non-renormalisable\nsuperpotential term of the lowest possible dimension, d = 4. In order to account for\nthe baryon-to-dark matter ratio, the baryon asymmetry must then originate via AD\nleptogenesis along the d = 4 (HuL)\n2 flat direction1. The superpotential we consider is\ntherefore\nW = W\u03bdMSSM +WNR , (1)\nwhere W\u03bdMSSM is the \u03bdMSSM superpotential\nW\u03bdMSSM = \u03bb\u03bdNHuL+ \u03bbee\ncHdL+ \u03bbuu\ncHuQ+ \u03bbdd\ncHdQ+ \u00b5HuHd +\nMN\n2\nN2 (2)\nand WNR contains Planck-suppressed non-renormalisable terms\n2\nWNR =\n\u03bbN\n4!\nN4\nM\n+\n\u03bb\u03a6\n4!\n\u03a64\nM\n. (3)\nHere N is the RH neutrino superfield, \u03a6 is the flat direction AD superfield of the\nd = 4 (HuL)\n2 flat direction and M = MP l\/\n\u221a\n8pi \u2248 2.4 \u00d7 1018 GeV. For simplicity\nwe have suppressed generation indices. N carries lepton number L = 1. This is the\nmost general renormalisable superpotential which is invariant under standard R-parity,\nwhich we assume is unbroken in order to have a stable LSP.\n1In order to have an (HuL)\n2 flat direction in the presence of a large amplitude for N in the\n\u03bdMSSM, the N field would have consist of combination of N generations that does not couple to the\nflat direction L via \u03bb\u03bd . However, since we are considering very small values of \u03bb\u03bd in the following,\n\u03bb\u03bd\n<\n\u223c\n10\u221212, in practice any lifting of the (HuL)\n2 flat direction by the N amplitude is negligible.\n2We include 1\/4! factors so that the physical strength of the interactions is dimensionally deter-\nmined by M .\n4\nMN cannot be larger than the soft SUSY breaking mass scale, ms \u2248 100 GeV \u2212\n1 TeV, if the RH sneutrino is to be the LSP. The simplest possibility is that there is\nno N2 term in the superpotential, in which case the neutrinos gain Dirac masses via\nvery small Yukawa couplings, \u03bb\u03bd\n<\n\u223c 10\n\u221212. This can be understood if the renormalisable\npart of the superpotential has an R-symmetry under which R(uc, dc, ec, Q, L,N) = 1\/2,\nR(Hu, Hd) = 1. The R-symmetry is assumed to be broken by the Planck-suppressed\nnon-renormalisable terms. Alternatively, lepton number may be conserved in the\nrenormalisable superpotential but broken by the non-renormalisable terms. In order\nto generate a baryon density similar to the dark matter density we need a d = 4 B\u2212L-\nviolating flat direction. For the conventional MSSM flat directions (those independent\nof N), the only B \u2212 L-violating d = 4 monomial is (HuL)2 [6, 7]. In addition there\nare B \u2212 L conserving MSSM flat directions corresponding to the monomials QQQL\nand ucucdcec. However, unless there is a suppression of these superpotential terms for\n1st and 2nd generation superfields they will induce too rapid proton decay [18, 19].\nThe QQQL and ucucdcec terms can be eliminated by an anomaly-free discrete gauge\nsymmetry of the MSSM (which is left unbroken by quantum gravity effects) which\npermits the (HUL)\n2 operator [19, 20]. Under the requirements that baryon-number is\nconserved up to dimension 5 operators and that the MSSM \u00b5-term and (HUL)\n2 op-\nerator are permitted, the possible anomaly-free discrete gauge symmetries are baryon\ntriality [19], which requires seperate imposition of R-parity (also anomaly-free) to ob-\ntain the MSSM, or baryon hexality, which automatically reproduces the low-energy\nR-parity conserving superpotential [20].\n2.1 Scalar Potential for d = 4 Flat Direction\nFor a d = 4 flat direction lifted by a superpotential of the form,\nW\u03a8 =\n\u03bb\u03a8\n4!\n\u03a84\nM\n, (4)\nthe generic scalar potential with gravity-mediated soft SUSY-breaking terms and order\nH corrections from supergravity [6, 21, 22] is of the form\nV (\u03a8) =\n(\nm2\u03a8 \u2212 c\u03a8H2\n)\n|\u03a8|2 +\n(\nA\u03a8\n\u03bb\u03a8\n4!M\n\u03a84 + h.c.\n)\n+\n|\u03bb\u03a8|2\n3!2M2\n|\u03a8|6 , (5)\n5\nwhere \u03a8 (\u2261 N or \u03a6) denotes the flat direction superfield of interest. The couplings\nc\u03a8 and \u03bb\u03a8 are usually assumed to have magnitude of order 1, although smaller values\nof \u03bb\u03a8 could conceivably occur depending on the Planck-scale physics responsible for\nthe non-renormalisable terms. The form of the order H corrections during and after\ninflation will depend on the origin of the energy density driving inflation (i.e. whether\nit is driven by an F- or D-term in the scalar potential3) and the Ka\u00a8hler potential.\nIn D-term inflation |c\u03a8| = 0 during inflation and |c\u03a8| \u2248 1 after inflation. For F-term\ninflation |c\u03a8| \u2248 1 during and after inflation 4. In order not to suppress the amplitude of\nthe RH sneutrino or Affleck-Dine scalar we will consider the case where c\u03a8 is positive.\nIn this case the scalar potential has a minimum after inflation ends. For H > m\u03a8 the\nminimum of the potential is given by\n|\u03a8|min \u2248\n(\n12c\u03a8\n\u03bb2\u03a8\n)1\/4\n(HM)1\/2 . (6)\nThe \u03a8 6= 0 minimum of the potential will vanish at H = Hosc \u03a8 \u2248 m\u03a8\/c1\/2\u03a8 , at which\ntime coherent oscillations of the \u03a8 field begin. The initial amplitude of the coherently\noscillating \u03a8 field is then\n|\u03a8|osc \u2248 |\u03a8|min[H \u2248 Hosc \u03a8] =\n(\n12\n\u03bb2\u03a8\n)1\/4\n(m\u03a8M)\n1\/2 . (7)\nThe initial energy density in the oscillating field is then\n\u03c1\u03a8 osc = m\n2\n\u03a8|\u03a8|2osc \u2248\n\u221a\n12\n\u03bb\u03a8\nm3\u03a8M . (8)\n2.2 CDM from a d = 4 RH Sneutrino Condensate\nThe RH sneutrino is the unique candidate for condensate dark matter in the \u03bdMSSM.\nConventional MSSM flat directions are linear combinations of squark and slepton\n3In this paper F- and D-term inflation will refer to the term in the inflaton scalar potential\nresponsible for driving inflation. F-term and D-term hybrid inflation models are specific examples of\nthese.\n4F-term inflation models can have |c\u03a8| = 0 during and after inflation if there is a Heisenberg\nsymmetry of the Ka\u00a8hler potential [23]\n6\nfields, which are generally excluded as dark matter candidiates [24]. In contrast, the\nRH sneutrino can have very weak Yukawa couplings and is a gauge-singlet. It can\ntherefore easily evade all direct constraints on dark matter particles. In particular, the\nmodel withMN = 0 has Dirac neutrino masses and therefore extremely small neutrino\nYukawa couplings, \u03bb\u03bd\n<\n\u223c 10\n\u221212, making the RH sneutrino an excellent candidate for\ncondensate dark matter in this case.\nCoherent oscillations of the RH sneutrino begin before radiation domination if the\nreheating temperature satisfies the gravitino bound TR\n<\n\u223c 10\n6\u22128 GeV [25], since in\nthis case H(TR)\n<\n\u223c 0.1 GeV \u226a mN . The present energy density in the RH sneutrino\ncondensate is therefore\n\u03c1N o =\n(\naosc\naR\n)3 (aR\nao\n)3\n\u03c1N osc =\ncNk\n2\nT\u03b3T\n3\n\u03b3TR\nM2m2N\n\u03c1N osc , (9)\nwhere aR is the scale factor at radiation-domination, ao is the scale factor at present,\nT\u03b3 is the present photon temperature, \u03c1c = 8.1\u00d7h210\u221247GeV 4 is the critical density for\na flat Universe, \u03c1N osc = m\n2\nN |N |2osc and kT = (pi2g (T ) \/90)1\/2 with g(T ) is the number\nof degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium. The reheating temperature required to\nhave a RH sneutrino condensate density \u2126N is therefore\nTR \u2248\n(\n\u03bb2N\n12\n)1\/2\nM\u2126N\u03c1c\ncNk\n2\nT\u03b3T\n3\n\u03b3mN\n. (10)\nWith typical values for the parameters this becomes\nTR \u2248 2.6\u00d7 107 \u03bbN\ncN\n(\nh\n0.7\n)2 (\n\u2126N\n0.23\n)(\n100 GeV\nmN\n)\nGeV . (11)\nFor example, if \u03bbN\/cN is in the range 0.1 to 1 then a value of TR in the range 10\n6 \u2212\n108 GeV is necessary to account for dark matter. This range of TR is compatible with\nthe gravitino upper bound on the reheating temperature, even for the case where the\ngravitino decays primarily to hadrons [25].\n2.3 d = 4 (HuL)\n2 Affleck-Dine Leptogenesis\nThe A-term proportional to \u03a64 \u223c (HuL)2 breaks L and is explicitly dependent upon\nthe phase of the \u03a6 scalar. It can therefore induce a lepton asymmetry in the complex\n7\n\u03a6 condensate via the Affleck-Dine mechanism [5]. The contribution of the A-terms\nto the potential is comparable with the mass squared term just when the complex \u03a6\ncondensate forms at H = Hosc \u03a6 \u2248 m\u03a6\/c1\/2\u03a6 . If we define the real direction of \u03a6 to\nbe that along which the gravity-mediated A-term is real and negative, then the CP\nviolating phase responsible for the L asymmetry approximately corresponds to the\nangle of the \u03a6 field in the complex plane at H = Hosc \u03a6 relative to this late-time real\ndirection. The origin of this angle will differ depending on whether the A-term itself\nreceives an order H correction after the end of slow-roll inflation.\nThe order H correction to the A-term originates from cross-terms in the supergrav-\nity potential which couple the inflaton S to the flat direction scalars \u03a8. For |S| \u226aM\nthe contribution of these terms can be expanded in powers of S\/M [6]\nL \u223c 1\nM\n\u222b\nd4\u03b8S\u03a8\u2020\u03a8+O\n(\n1\nM2\n) \u222b\nd4\u03b8S2\u03a8\u2020\u03a8+ ... . (12)\nThis implies an A-term due to the inflaton F-term of the form\nAi = As i + ai\n(\n1 +O\n(\nS\nM\n)\n+ ...\n)\nH , (13)\nwhere As i is the gravity-mediated A-term and |ai| \u2248 1. Therefore if there is a linear\ncoupling of the inflaton superfield to the flat direction scalar in the effective theory\nthen an order H correction to the A-term will arise. However, if the linear term is\nsuppressed then the leading A-term correction will be of order (|S|H\/M). In this\ncase the A-term will have no dynamical effect if |S|\/M is sufficiently small during and\nafter inflation, which we will show is the case if |S|\/M <\u223c 1\/40. The suppression of\norder H corrections to the A-terms can have significant consequences for isocurvature\nperturbations.\nIn the case with order H corrections to the A-terms, the flat direction scalar will\nbe at the minimum of the scalar potential along the direction which makes the H-\ndependent A-terms real and negative. So long as there is a complex phase between\nAs i and ai, then at the onset of AD condensate formation (at which time the As i and\naiH terms are comparable) the real direction will change from that defined by ai to\nthat defined by As i as H decreases. Therefore initially the oscillating \u03a6 field is not\n8\nalong the late-time real direction. Since at H = Hosc \u03a6 the mass squared term and\nA-term in the scalar potential are of comparable magnitude, the A-term will cause\nthe real and imaginary components of \u03a6 to oscillate out of phase. This results in a\ncondensate which describes an ellipse in the complex plane at late times, corresponding\nto an L asymmetry in the AD condensate [5].\nIf there is a symmetry under which the inflaton transforms, such as a discrete\nsymmetry or an R-symmetry, then the order H corrrections to the A-term will be\nsuppressed both during and after inflation. Such a symmetry is a common feature\nof SUSY inflation models e.g. an R-symmetry may protect the inflaton potential\nfrom non-renormalisable corrections in SUSY hybrid inflation models [26, 27, 28]. For\nsufficiently suppressed H corrections to the A-terms, the complex phase producing\nthe L-asymmetry will simply be the random initial phase of \u03a6 which exists during\ninflation.\nIn either case, atH \u226a Hosc \u03a6 the \u03a6 scalar will be of the form \u03a6(t) = (\u03c61(t) + i\u03c62(t)) \/\n\u221a\n2,\nwhere\n\u03c61 = \u03c6(t) cos(\u03b8) sin(m\u03a6t) ; \u03c62 = \u03c6(t) sin(\u03b8) sin(m\u03a6t+ \u03b4) ; \u03c6(t) \u221d a\u22123\/2 . (14)\nHere \u03b8 is the initial phase of the \u03a6 field relative to the late-time real direction and \u03b4 is\na phase shift induced by the A-term; the precise value of \u03b8 and \u03b4 will be determined\nby the scalar field dynamics during the period when the \u03a6 6= 0 minimum vanishes at\nH \u2248 Hosc \u03a6. The resulting L asymmetry of the AD condensate is then\nnL =\ni\n2\n(\n\u03a6\u02d9\u2020\u03a6\u2212 \u03a6\u2020\u03a6\u02d9\n)\n=\n1\n4\nm\u03a6\u03c6\n2(t) sin(2\u03b8) sin(\u03b4) . (15)\nIn this we have included an overall factor 1\/2 since the \u03a6 field carries lepton number\nL = 1\/2. Once the AD condensate decays the lepton asymmetry will be converted into\na baryon asymmetry by B+L violating sphaleron processes, such that nB = nL initial\/2.\nThe magnitude of the baryon asymmetry today is then\nnB =\nfA\n4\n\u03c1\u03a6 o\nm\u03a6\n; fA = sin(2\u03b8) sin(\u03b4) . (16)\nIn this we have defined \u03c1\u03a6 o = m\n2\n\u03a6\u03c6(to)\n2\/2 to be the density that a coherently oscillating\n\u03a6 field along the d = 4 flat direction would have at present if it did not decay, where\n9\n\u03c6(to) is the amplitude the oscillating field at present. fA is a factor parameterising the\nCP-violation due to the A-term. For typical CP violating angles and initial conditions\nwe expect fA to be in the range 0.1-1.\n2.4 Baryon-to-Dark Matter Ratio\nFrom Eq. (16) energy density in baryons at present is\n\u03c1B o = mnnB =\nfA\n4\nmn\nm\u03a6\n\u03c1\u03a6 o , (17)\nwhere mn is the nucleon mass. From this we can that the energy density in baryons\nis typically of the order of mn\/m\u03a6 times the energy density in a coherently oscillating\nd = 4 flat direction scalar. Therefore if dark matter is due to a condensate along\na d = 4 direction we will automatically have similar values of \u2126DM and \u2126B. From\nEq. (8) and Eq. (9) we find that \u03c1N o \u221d cNmN\/\u03bbN , with an analogous expression for\n\u03c1\u03a6 o. Therefore\n\u2126B\n\u2126DM\n=\nfA\n4\nmn\nm\u03a6\n\u03c1\u03a6 o\n\u03c1N o\n=\nfA\n4\nmn\nmN\nc\u03a6\n\u03bb\u03a6\n\u03bbN\ncN\n=\nfA\n400\n(\n100 GeV\nmN\n)\nc\u03a6\ncN\n\u03bbN\n\u03bb\u03a6\n. (18)\nThis shows that it is possible to explain the observed baryon-to-dark matter density ra-\ntio, \u2126B\/\u2126DM \u2248 1\/6, with values of \u03bbN and \u03bb\u03a6 which are within an order of magnitude\nof each other. For example, \u03bbN \u2248 10\u03bb\u03a6, c\u03a6 \u2248 6cN , fA \u2248 1 and mN \u2248 100 GeV gives\n\u2126B\/\u2126DM \u2248 1\/6. If \u03bb\u03a6 can be significantly less than \u03bbN , for example \u03bb\u03a6 \u2248 0.01\u03bbN ,\nthen smaller values of fA and c\u03a6 are possible.\nThus the baryon-to-dark matter ratio can be accounted for if the couplings \u03bb for all\nd = 4 flat directions of the \u03bdMSSM are within a few orders of magnitude of each other.\nA small hierarchy, with \u03bb\u03a6 one to two orders of magnitude less than \u03bbN , is required.\nSince there could be a generational dependence of the non-renormalisable couplings,\nas in the case of renormalisable Yukawa couplings in the MSSM, it is reasonable to\nexpect that \u03bb\u03a6 and \u03bbN could have significantly different values. Another possibility,\nwhich will be explored in future work, is that renormalization group evolution of the\ncouplings of the (HuL)\n2 flat direction scalar and the RH sneutrino from the Planck\nscale to the scale of AD leptogenesis could result in the required hierarchy.\n10\nIn the case with three generations of RH sneutrino, we expect condensates of all\nthree RH sneutrino mass eigenstates to form. The heavier RH sneutrinos will decay to\nthe LSP RH sneutrino. Any matrix element for the decay of the heavier RH sneutrinos\nto the LSP will be proportional to \u03bb2\u03bd , therefore a very conservative upper bound on\nthe decay rate is \u0393 < \u03bb4\u03bdmN . With \u03bb\u03bd \u2248 10\u221212 and mN \u2248 100 GeV this gives a lifetime\n\u03c4 > 1014 years. Therefore the heavier RH sneutrinos have a lifetime longer than the\nage of the Universe and so will also contribute to the dark matter density.\n3 Isocurvature Perturbations\nIsocurvature perturbations of both the CDM and baryons can arise due to quantum\nfluctuations of the amplitude and phase of the flat direction scalar fields during infla-\ntion. The magnitude of the resulting isocurvature perturbation today will depend on\nthe form of the order H corrections to the mass squared terms and A-terms during\nand after inflation.\n3.1 CDM Isocurvature Perturbation\nIf all order H corrections are zero during inflation, as in D-term inflation models, then\nthe complex inflation field is massless and so there will be quantum fluctuations of\nboth the phase and amplitude.\nAn alternative possibility is that the H corrections to the A-terms are sufficiently\nsuppressed both during and after inflation. In this case the quantum fluctuations of\nthe phase of N will be unsuppressed during and after inflation in both D-term and F-\nterm inflation models. When the expansion rate drops to Hosc N , the A-term becomes\ndynamically important since the contribution of the A-term to the potential is of the\nsame magnitude as the mass squared term at this time. The effect is that the quantum\nfluctuation in the phase field \u03b4\u03b8 will induce a fluctuation in the N amplitude such that\n|\u03b4N\/N | = O(1)\u03b4\u03b8. (This mechanism was first discussed in the context of the phase-\ninduced curvaton model [29].) Therefore CDM isocurvature perturbations can also be\ngenerated in F-term inflation models.\n11\nThe condition for the phase fluctuations to be effectively unsuppressed is that\nthe correlation length of the fluctuation at the end of inflation, l \u2248 H\u22121e3H2\/2m2 , is\nlarger than the region corresponding to the observed Universe, which requires that\n3H2\/2m2 > 60, where m is the mass of the fluctuating field [6]. In the case of the\nphase field, an order H A-term correction will produce an effective mass for the field\nat the minimum of the potential m2 \u2248 H2. In the case of suppressed linear inflaton\ncouplings, this effective mass becomes m2 \u2248 |S|H2\/M . Therefore the inflaton field\nduring inflation must satisfy |S|\/M <\u223c 1\/40 for the A-term correction to be negligible.\nTo analyse the isocurvature perturbations we follow the discussion given in [30].\nSince the adiabatic perturbations come from inflaton quantum fluctuations while the\nCDM isocurvature perturbations come from unrelated quantum fluctuations of the\nRH sneutrino field, the adiabatic and CDM isocurvature perturbations will be uncor-\nrelated. The angular power spectrum due to a mixture of uncorrelated adiabatic and\nCDM isocurvature perturbations is given by [30]\nCl = (1\u2212 \u03b1)Cadl + \u03b1Cisol , (19)\nwhere\n\u03b1 =\nB2\n1 +B2\n; B2 =\n|S(k)|2\n|R(k)|2 . (20)\nCadl and C\niso\nl are the multipole moments for the adiabatic and CDM isocurvature per-\nturbation. |S(k)|2 and |R(k)|2 are the Fourier transforms of the mean squared entropy\nand curvature perturbation respectively. These are related to the power spectra by\n|R(k)|2 = 2pi\n2PR\nk3\n; |S(k)|2 = 2pi\n2PS\nk3\n. (21)\nPR is given by its COBE-normalised value, P\n1\/2\nR = 4.8\u00d7 10\u22125 [33].\nIn the following we will consider the RH sneutrino dark matter to oscillate in the\nreal direction, so that N = N1\/\n\u221a\n2. For simplicity we will drop the subscript 1 and use\nN to denote the canonically normalized real part of the complex field. The entropy\nperturbation is related to the fluctuation of the RH sneutrino field at the onset of\ncoherent oscillations\nS =\n(\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c1\n)\nN iso\n\u2261 2\u03b4NI\nNI\n. (22)\n12\nHere NI and \u03b4NI are the values of the amplitude and its fluctuation at horizon exit\nduring inflation. In this we assume that \u03b4N\/N remains constant once the fluctuation\nexits the horizon, which we show below is true for d = 4 directions. Therefore\nPS \u2261 P( 2\u03b4NI\nNI\n) = 4P\u03b4NI\nN2I\n; P\u03b4NI =\n(\nHI\n2pi\n)2\n, (23)\nwhere HI is the value of H during inflation, which for simplicity we assume to be\nconstant. Therefore\n|S|2 = 2H\n2\nI\nk3N2I\n. (24)\nand\nB2 \u2261 |S|\n2\n|R|2 =\nH2I\npi2PRN2I\n. (25)\nIn the following we consider the limit where \u03b1 is small compared with 1, in which case\n\u03b1 \u2248 B2.\nFor the case of F-term inflation with suppressed orderH corrections to the A-terms,\nfluctuations \u03b4\u03b8 of the phase of the flat-direction field are unsuppressed. At the onset\nof coherent oscillations, the A-term induce an amplitude fluctuation \u03b4N\/N = O(1)\u03b4\u03b8\n[29]. The fluctuation of the phase is related to the fluctuation of the field during\ninflation by \u03b4\u03b8 \u2248 \u03b4N2\/NI , where N2\/\n\u221a\n2 is the complex part of the RH sneutrino field.\nTherefore, up to an O(1) factor, the amplitude fluctuation of the RH sneutrino at the\nonset of coherent oscillations is the same as in D-term inflation.\nThe value of NI in D-term inflation has an upper limit from the requirement that\nV\n\u2032\u2032\n(N) <\u223c H\n2, above which the RH sneutrino is no longer effectively massless and\nis rapidly evolving. (In this we are discounting the unlikely possibility that the RH\nsneutrino is rapidly rolling at N \u2248 60 e-foldings before the end of inflation.) This\ncorresponds to NI\n<\n\u223c N\u2217 where\nN\u2217 =\n(\n48\n5\u03bb2N\n)1\/4\n(MHI)\n1\/2 . (26)\nN < N\u2217 then implies a lower bound, \u03b1min, on the value of \u03b1, given by\n\u03b1min \u2248\n(\n5\n48\n)1\/2 \u03bbN\npi2PR\nHI\nM\n. (27)\n13\nThe 2-\u03c3 observational upper bound for an uncorrelated CDM isocurvature perturba-\ntion from WMAP3 is \u03b1lim = 0.26 [31]\n5. Requiring that \u03b1min < \u03b1lim then gives us an\nupper bound on the value of H during inflation\nHI\n<\n\u223c\n(\n48\n5\n)1\/2 pi2PRM\u03b1lim\n\u03bbN\n\u2261 4.4\u00d7 1011\n(\n0.1\n\u03bbN\n)(\n\u03b1lim\n0.26\n)\nGeV . (28)\nF-term inflation differs from D-term inflation in that NI is fixed to be at the\nminimum of its potential during inflation,\nNI = Nmin \u2261\n(\n48cN\n\u03bb2N\n)1\/4\n(MHI)\n1\/2 . (29)\nThe lower bound on \u03b1 and the upper bound on HI in this case are now\n\u03b1min =\n(\n1\n48cN\n)1\/2 \u03bbN\npi2PR\nHI\nM\n(30)\nand\nHI\n<\n\u223c (24cN)\n1\/2 pi\n2PR\u03b1limM\n\u03bbN\n\u2261 9.5\u00d7 1011c1\/2N\n(\n0.1\n\u03bbN\n)(\n\u03b1lim\n0.26\n)\nGeV . (31)\nIt is interesting that the upper bounds on HI are typically in the range 10\n10 \u2212\n1013 GeV for \u03bbN = 0.01\u2212 1. As such they are large enough not to require an inflation\nmodel with an extremely small value ofHI , yet small enough to offer a realistic prospect\nof detecting the CDM isocurvature perturbation in the future.\nWe can compare these upper bounds with the value of HI expected in common\nSUSY inflation models. In the case of D-term hybrid inflation [26],HI \u2248 1\u00d71013g GeV,\nwhere g is the U(1) gauge coupling, corresponding to an energy density during inflation\nV = g2\u03be2\/2. (In this we have assumed a Fayet-Iliopoulos term \u03be1\/2 = 8 \u00d7 1015 GeV,\nas required by the observed curvature perturbation.) Comparing with Eq. (28) we\nsee that for D-term hybrid inflation the CDM isocurvature perturbation is compatible\nwith observation only if the gauge coupling satisfies g <\u223c 0.05 when \u03bbN \u2248 0.1. This\nsuggests that the CDM isocurvature perturbation in D-term hybrid inflation is likely\nto be close to the present observational limit, although a small value of the gauge\n5An alternative method, using Bayesian model selection, may allow a tighter upper bound on \u03b1\nto be obtained [32].\n14\ncoupling and\/or non-renormalisable superpotential coupling is required for the CDM\nisocurvature perturbation to be within observational limits; if \u03bbN \u2248 1 and g >\u223c 0.1 then\nD-term hybrid inflation would be excluded. In the case of F-term hybrid inflation with\nsuppressed order H A-term corrections, |S|\/M <\u223c 1\/40 is necessary in order to have\na large enough correlation length for an isocurvature fluctuation to exist. The value\nof S at N \u2248 60 e-foldings of inflation is |S|\/M = \u03ba\u221aN\/2pi \u2248 1.2\u03ba, where \u03ba is the\nYukawa coupling of the F-term hybrid inflation superpotential (W = \u03baS(\u2212\u00b52 + \u03c6\u03c6))\n[27]. Therefore to have |S|\/M <\u223c 1\/40 we require that \u03ba <\u223c 0.01. The value of HI\nduring F-term hybrid inflation is HI = 7 \u00d7 1012\u03ba GeV, corresponding to an energy\ndensity during inflation V = \u03ba2\u00b54. (We have assumed \u00b5 = 5\u00d71015 GeV as required by\nthe observed curvature perturbation.) Therefore if a CDM isocurvature perturbation\nexists (\u03ba <\u223c 0.01) then HI\n<\n\u223c 7 \u00d7 1010 GeV. Comparing with Eq. (31) shows that the\nCDM isocurvature perturbation in F-term hybrid inflation can be close to the present\nobservational limit if \u03bbN \u2248 1.\nIn the above we have assumed that there is no suppression of the isocurvature\nperturbation after inflation. This will generally be true in the case without order H\ncorrections to the A-term. In this case the isocurvature perturbation originates from\nphase fluctuations of the flat direction field, which do not evolve since the phase field\nis massless. In the case of D-term inflation with order H corrections to the A-terms\nafter inflation we need to check whether there is any suppression of the amplitude and\nphase fluctuations.\nOnce inflation ends the potential acquires a minimum to which the flat direction\nfield will roll and coherently oscillate. We consider the evolution of the RH sneutrino\nalong the real direction, N(x, t) = N(t)+ \u03b4N(x, t). The zero mode, N(t), and k mode\nof \u03b4N(x, t), \u03b4Nk(t), will satisfy the equations\nN\u00a8 + 3HN\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202V\n\u2202N\n(32)\nand\n\u03b4N\u00a8k + 3H\u03b4N\u02d9k \u2248 \u2212\n(\n\u22022V\n\u2202N2\n)\nN(t)\n\u03b4Nk , (33)\n15\nwhere we assume that k\/a\u226a H in Eq. (33). If at the end of inflation N(t)\u226a Nmin(t)\nthen N(t) and \u03b4Nk(t) will evolve in a potential V \u2248 \u2212cNH2|N |2. As a result N(t)\nand \u03b4Nk(t) satisfy the same equation and therefore \u03b4Nk(t)\/N(t) remains constant\nuntil N(t) \u2248 Nmin. Thereafter, to a good approximation, N(t) = Nmin(t) during the\npost-inflation era. In this case\n\u03b4N\u00a8k + 3H\u03b4N\u02d9k = \u22124cNH2\u03b4Nk . (34)\nWith H \u221d a\u22123\/2 during inflaton coherent oscillations the solution is \u03b4Nk(t) \u221d a\u03b3 ,\nwhere [6, 34]\n\u03b3 =\n1\n2\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u22123\n2\n+\n\u221a\n9\n4\n\u2212 16cN\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb . (35)\nThe largest suppression will occur for the case where 16cN >\n9\n4\n, in which case |\u03b4Nk| \u221d\na\u22123\/4. For a d = 4 flat direction N(t) \u2248 Nmin(t) \u221d H1\/2 \u221d a\u22123\/4, therefore \u03b4Nk\/Nmin\nis constant i.e. there is no suppression of the isocurvature perturbation for a d = 4 flat\ndirection due to evolution of the fields after inflation. Note that this result is peculiar\nto a d = 4 flat direction: in general the minimum of the potential is proportional to\nH1\/(d\u22122), so that \u03b4Nk\/Nmin \u221d a3(1\/(d\u22122)\u22121\/2)\/2 .\nIn the case where there are order H corrections to the A-terms after inflation, the\nphase field at the minimum of the potential will also have a mass squared of order\nH2 and so will oscillate about the minimum is the same way as the amplitude field.\nTherefore there will also be no suppression of the magnitude of the phase fluctuation\nafter inflation.\nTo summarise, a CDM isocurvature perturbation will be generated in the case of\nD-term inflation models in general and also in F-term inflation model with suppressed\norder H corrrections to the A-terms. The magnitude of the CDM isocurvature per-\nturbation in common SUSY inflation models can be naturally close to the present\nobservational bound.\n16\n3.2 Baryon Isocurvature Perturbation\nFluctuations of the phase and amplitude of the AD scalar will result in baryon isocur-\nvature perturbations. We will consider only the case of phase fluctuations, which will\nbe unsuppressed if order H corrections to the A-terms are suppressed during infla-\ntion. The magnitude of the baryon isocurvature perturbation due to unsuppressed\namplitude fluctuations in D-term inflation models will be similar.\nIn the case of D-term inflation, there is no suppression of fluctuations in the real\nor imaginary direction during inflation. Defining the AD scalar by\n\u03a6 =\n\u03c6\u221a\n2\nei\u03b8 =\n1\u221a\n2\n(\u03c61 + i\u03c62) , (36)\nthe fluctuation of the phase is related to the field fluctuations by\n\u03b4\u03b8 =\n\u2212 sin \u03b8\u03b4\u03c61 + cos \u03b8\u03b4\u03c62\n\u03c6I\n, (37)\nwhere \u03c6I is the value of \u03c6 during inflation. Therefore\n< \u03b4\u03b82 >=\nsin2 \u03b8 < \u03b4\u03c621 > +cos\n2 \u03b8 < \u03b4\u03c622 >\n\u03c62I\n, (38)\nwhere \u03b4\u03c61 and \u03b4\u03c62 are uncorrelated perturbations. Using < \u03b4\u03c6\n2\n1 >=< \u03b4\u03c6\n2\n2 >=< \u03b4\u03c6\n2 >\nwe obtain\n< \u03b4\u03b82 >=\n< \u03b4\u03c62 >\n\u03c62I\n. (39)\nThe power spectrum of \u03b8 fluctuations is therefore\nP\u03b4\u03b8 =\nP\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03c62I\n; P\u03b4\u03c6 =\n(\nHI\n2pi\n)2\n. (40)\nThe Fourier transform of the \u03b4\u03b8 power spectrum is\n|T\u03b8|2 = 2pi\n2\nk3\nP\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03c62I\n=\n1\n2k3\nH2I\n\u03c62I\n. (41)\nFrom Eq. (16) the baryon asymmetry is proportional to sin(2\u03b8). Therefore\n\u03b4nB\nnB\n= f\u03b8\u03b4\u03b8 ; f\u03b8 =\n2\ntan 2\u03b8\n. (42)\n17\nThe baryon entropy perturbation is SB = \u03b4nB\/nB. The Fourier transform of the\nbaryon entropy perturbation power spectrum is then\n|SB|2 = f 2\u03b8 |T\u03b8|2 =\n1\n2k3\nf 2\u03b8H\n2\nI\n\u03c62I\n. (43)\nTherefore the contribution of the baryon isocurvature (BI) perturbation to the CMB\nis given by\n\u03b1BI \u2248\n(\n\u2126B\n\u2126DM\n)2 |SB|2\n|R|2 =\n(\n\u2126B\n\u2126DM\n)2 f 2\u03b8H2I\n4pi2PR\u03c6\n2\nI\n, (44)\nwhere the factor (\u2126B\/\u2126DM)\n2 rescales the CDM isocurvature perturbation Cisol to the\nbaryon case [30].\nAs in the case of the RH sneutrino, in the case of D-term inflation there is an upper\nlimit on \u03c6I from the requirement that \u03c6I\n<\n\u223c \u03c6\u2217, defined by V\n\u2032\u2032\n(\u03c6\u2217) = H\n2,\n\u03c62\u2217 =\n(\n48\n5\u03bb2\u03a6\n)1\/2\nHIM . (45)\n\u03b1BI can then be written as\n\u03b1BI \u2248\n(\n\u2126B\n\u2126DM\n)2 (5\u03bb2\u03a6\n48\n)1\/2\nf 2\u03b8\n4pi2PR\nHI\nM\n(\n\u03c6\u2217\n\u03c6I\n)2\n. (46)\nThe same observational limit, \u03b1lim < 0.26, applies to the baryon isocurvature per-\nturbation as in the CDM case, since the perturbations are almost observationally\nindistinguishable [31]. This then gives an upper bound on H during inflation\nHI\n<\n\u223c 5.7\u00d7 1012\n(\n0.04\n\u2126B\n)2 (\u2126DM\n0.23\n)2 1\n\u03bb\u03a6f 2\u03b8\n(\n\u03b1lim\n0.26\n)(\n\u03c6I\n\u03c6\u2217\n)2\nGeV . (47)\nTherefore in the case where \u03c6I is close to \u03c6\u2217, and with \u03bb\u03a6\n<\n\u223c \u03bbN as required by the\nbaryon-to-dark matter ratio, the constraint on HI is much weaker than in the case\nof the CDM isocurvature perturbation, Eq. (28). However, in D-term inflation it is\npossible that \u03c6I could be small compared with \u03c6\u2217 while NI is close to N\u2217, in which\ncase it may be possible to have both a baryon and CDM isocurvature perturbation of\nsimilar magnitude.\nIn the case of F-term inflation we should replace \u03c6I with \u03c6min in Eq. (47), which\ngives\nHI\n<\n\u223c 1.3\u00d7 1013\n(\n0.04\n\u2126B\n)2 (\u2126DM\n0.23\n)2 c1\/2\u03c6\n\u03bb\u03a6f 2\u03b8\n(\n\u03b1lim\n0.26\n)\nGeV . (48)\n18\nThis is generally a much weaker bound than the CDM isocurvature upper bound,\nEq. (31), when \u03bb\u03a6\n<\n\u223c \u03bbN . Thus the baryon isocurvature perturbation will make a\nmuch smaller contribution than the CDM isocurvature perturbation in F-term inflation\nmodels. The observation of CDM and baryon isocurvature perturbations of a similar\nmagnitude would therefore be a signature of inflation driven by a D-term in this model.\n4 Conclusions\nIn trying to reconstruct early cosmology from information provided by astronomical\nobservations and particle physics experiments, we need to make full use of any clue\nprovided by nature. One possible clue is the striking similarity of the density in\nbaryons and cold dark matter. It is a highly non-trivial feature of a particle physics\ntheory to have a mechanism within its structure which can explain the baryon-to-dark\nmatter ratio. Therefore the baryon-to-dark matter ratio could serve a discrimiator of,\nsimultaneously, the correct particle physics theory, the nature of cold dark matter and\nthe origin of the baryon asymmetry. Moreover, if we accept that a model which is\nable to account naturally for the baryon-to-dark matter ratio has a high likelihood of\nbeing the correct model, we may be able to use this information to draw conclusions\nabout the very early Universe, such as the nature of the inflation model.\nIn this paper we have considered the implications of the baryon-to-dark matter ratio\nin the context of the \u03bdMSSM. The RH sneutrino condensate appears to be a uniquely\nsuitable candidate for cold dark matter in the \u03bdMSSM from the point of view of the\nbaryon-to-dark matter ratio. In the case where both the baryon asymmetry and CDM\ndensity originate along d = 4 flat directions of the \u03bdMSSM, we have shown that the\nobserved baryon-to-dark matter ratio can be understood if there is a small hierarchy\nbetween the non-renormalisable couplings of the RH neutrino and (HuL)\n2 flat direction\nsuperfields, with the (HuL)\n2 coupling one or two orders of magnitude less than the\nRH neutrino coupling. Such a hierarchy of couplings seems plausible given the range\nof values observed for the renormalisable Yukawa couplings of the MSSM. It would be\nsignificant if this hierarchy could be understood from the point of view of a complete\n19\ntheory of Planck-scale physics such as string theory.\nObservation of a CDM and\/or baryon isocurvature perturbation, combined with\nindirect accelerator evidence for a very weakly coupled RH sneutrino LSP, such as a\ncoloured or charged MSSM-LSP [4], would provide strong support for the RH sneutrino\ncondensate dark matter model. The model indicates that the CDM isocurvature per-\nturbation in D-term inflation models and in F-term inflation models with sufficiently\nsuppressed order H A-term corrections is likely to be close to present observational\nlimit. In addition, it is possible that a large baryon isocurvature perturbation could\narise in D-term inflation models, but in F-term inflation models it is generally sup-\npressed relative to the CDM isocurvature perturbation. Therefore observation of a\nCDM and baryon isocurvature perturbation of similar magnitude would be a signa-\nture of D-term inflation in this context, thus providing us with direct information on\nthe nature of SUSY inflation.\nAcknowledgement\nThe author would like to thank Christoph Luhn for his comments.\nReferences\n[1] D.N.Spergel et al, astro-ph\/0603449.\n[2] E.W.Kolb and M.S.Turner, The Early Universe (Addison-Wesley, Reading MA,\n1990).\n[3] H.P.Nilles, Phys.
