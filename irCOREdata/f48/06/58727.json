Introduction 18\u00a0\nManumiella Bujak and Davies 1983 is an important peridinioid dinoflagellate cyst 19\u00a0\ngenus in the Southern Hemisphere.  It is also of stratigraphical significance in the 20\u00a0\nMaastrichtian worldwide (e.g., Wilson, 1978; Helby et al., 1987; Yepes, 2001; Habib 21\u00a0\nand Saaedi, 2007).  It is distinguished from other genera by its well-developed 22\u00a0\ncircumcavate cyst organisation and an intercalary lati- or iso-deltaform hexa 2a 23\u00a0\n\u00a0 3\narchaeopyle style.  This generic distinction can often be difficult to determine from 1\u00a0\ndamaged or folded specimens, particularly with closely related genera, for example 2\u00a0\nthe otherwise similar but bicavate Isabelidinium Lentin and Williams 1977 emend. 3\u00a0\nMarshall 1988.  4\u00a0\nThis paper involves five species of Manumiella from the uppermost 280 m of the 5\u00a0\nL\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation on Seymour Island, northern Antarctic Peninsula 6\u00a0\n(Figure 1).  This sedimentary sequence, including the Cretaceous\/Tertiary (KT) 7\u00a0\nboundary, is a key high-latitude reference section for the Maastrichtian Stage, and the 8\u00a0\ndistribution of Manumiella within it is important for stratigraphic correlation.  This 9\u00a0\npaper reviews previously-described Manumiella species in light of a complex 10\u00a0\nmorphological continuum within this genus.  A taxonomic key is presented that 11\u00a0\nresolves five distinct morphotypes observed in the Seymour Island succession, which 12\u00a0\nwould previously have been interpreted as either separate species or end-members of 13\u00a0\na large suite of forms.  Their stratigraphical distribution in the Seymour Island 14\u00a0\nsequence and general palaeoecological significance are also considered.  One of these 15\u00a0\nmorphotypes, \u201cManumiella\u201d n. sp. 2 of Askin (1988a), is formally described as 16\u00a0\nManumiella bertodano sp. nov. 17\u00a0\n 18\u00a0\n2. Material studied 19\u00a0\nThe L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation is one of four subdivisions of the Coniacian-20\u00a0\nDanian Marambio Group and is confined to the James Ross Basin, Antarctic 21\u00a0\nPeninsula region (Figures 1 and 2; Pirrie et al., 1997; Crame et al., 2004).  It is 22\u00a0\npredominantly exposed on Seymour Island, where it attains a thickness of 23\u00a0\napproximately 1150 m, and is Maastrichtian to earliest Palaeocene in age based on 24\u00a0\nmacroinvertebrate and strontium isotope stratigraphy (Macellari, 1988; Crame et al., 25\u00a0\n\u00a0 4\n2004, Fig. 3). The authors of this paper logged, measured and collected material from 1\u00a0\nthe L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation on Seymour Island during the 2006 field season 2\u00a0\n(Thorn et al., 2007).  Only samples from the upper part of the formation are discussed 3\u00a0\nhere (section lines D5.219, D5.220, D5.222 and D5.229, presented as a composite 4\u00a0\nsection in Figure 2).  The sequence dips ~9\u00b0 to the southeast and consists of 5\u00a0\nunconsolidated clayey silts and silty clays, commonly bioturbated.  The sediments 6\u00a0\ncontain both authigenic and detrital glauconite and are interpreted to represent a mid- 7\u00a0\nto inner-shelf depositional setting.  The terrestrial and marine palynology of this 8\u00a0\nsequence is diverse and well-preserved, having undergone minimal burial diagenesis 9\u00a0\nsince deposition (Askin, 1988a,b, 1990, 1994).   10\u00a0\nSamples that contribute to this paper are listed (Table 1) and shown against a 11\u00a0\nsummary lithological log of the upper 280 m of the L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation 12\u00a0\nwith abundance data for marine taxa (as palynomorphs per gram of sediment, Figure 13\u00a0\n3).  The palynology of the lowermost 700m on Seymour Island is an ongoing project.  14\u00a0\nAll material in this study (i.e. rock\/sediment sample, fossils, microscope slides and 15\u00a0\nprepared residues) are curated in the collections of the British Antarctic Survey, 16\u00a0\nCambridge, United Kingdom.  The unique collection numbers are in the format 17\u00a0\nD5.***.1 for bulk sediment samples, with the suffix A (e.g. D5.1247.1A) referring to 18\u00a0\nmicroscope slide A prepared from the organic residue. 19\u00a0\n 20\u00a0\n3. Methodology 21\u00a0\nSediment was processed for quantitative biostratigraphic palynology using 22\u00a0\nstandard laboratory techniques.  Sediment was sieved at 180\u00b5m, treated with 23\u00a0\nhydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, and then oxidised for one or two minutes with 24\u00a0\nnitric acid.  Organic particles were separated from the remaining inorganics using zinc 25\u00a0\n\u00a0 5\nchloride heavy liquid and a swirling technique with a final sieve through a 10\u00b5m 1\u00a0\nmesh.  Notably, it was found that 10\u00b5m mesh cloths from different manufacturers 2\u00a0\nretained different size fractions, depending on the method of mesh manufacture.  3\u00a0\nConsistent retention of fine palynomorphs (specifically the smallest bryophyte spores, 4\u00a0\nfor example Stereisporites antiquasporites (Wilson and Webster 1946) Dettmann 5\u00a0\n1963) was only achieved with a heated and rolled mesh.  This appeared to maintain 6\u00a0\nthe stated mesh hole diameter when stretched over a mesh cloth holder in the 7\u00a0\nlaboratory.  A similar issue using mesh cloths of different materials and sizes during 8\u00a0\npalynological processing was discussed by Lignum et al. (2008) and is a serious 9\u00a0\nproblem that all palynologists should be aware of. 10\u00a0\nA known volume (0.5 g) of the extracted organic residue was permanently 11\u00a0\nmounted with PVA onto glass slides, allowing a calculation of palynomorphs per 12\u00a0\ngram of sediment.  Palynomorphs were counted along traverses across each cover slip 13\u00a0\nto a total of at least 300 grains (excluding Micrhystridium spp.) using a Leitz Ortholux 14\u00a0\ntransmitted light microscope.  Photographs were taken on an Olympus transmitted 15\u00a0\nlight microscope with a Leica digital camera.  16\u00a0\n 17\u00a0\n4. Taxonomy 18\u00a0\nDimensions and a summary of key characteristics of all Manumiella species 19\u00a0\nobserved in the L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation are presented in Tables 2 and 3 to aid 20\u00a0\ncomparison. To clarify the identification of Manumiella species a morphological key 21\u00a0\nhas been constructed as a tool for consistent taxonomic identification during counts.  22\u00a0\nThe premise of the key is that any specimens that are transitional between the 23\u00a0\npublished characteristics (or are too poorly preserved to designate further) should 24\u00a0\nsimply be assigned \u201cManumiella sp.\u201d status and not forced into a particular species 25\u00a0\n\u00a0 6\n(e.g., Figure 4 d, e), thus increasing confidence in stratigraphic range interpretations.  1\u00a0\nIt is acknowledged that there are similarities between the morphologies of 2\u00a0\nManumiella and Isabelidinium genera, however, the important feature is the 3\u00a0\ncircumcavate nature of the former and bicavate nature of the latter.   4\u00a0\n 5\u00a0\nMorphological Key for species of Manumiella: 6\u00a0\n 7\u00a0\n(1) Peridinioid cyst, circumcavate     (2) 8\u00a0\nPeridinioid cyst, bicavate   Isabelidinium  9\u00a0\n(2) Endocyst barely visible   Manumiella seymourensis 10\u00a0\nEndocyst prominent       (3) 11\u00a0\n(3) Evenly rounded or dimpled apex (antapex: concavity separating poorly 12\u00a0\ndeveloped antapical horns)   Manumiella druggii 13\u00a0\nApical horn        (4) 14\u00a0\n(4) Prominent apical horn*; elongate, sub-pentagonal periphragm outline 15\u00a0\n(antapex: asymmetrical well-developed antapical horns, longest often pointed)16\u00a0\n      Manumiella bertodano sp. nov. 17\u00a0\nShort, truncated apex or poorly developed apical horn  (5) 18\u00a0\n(5) Apical knob; antapical horns rounded, fairly well-developed, asymmetrical, 19\u00a0\nrounded and lozenge-shaped outline  Manumiella conorata 20\u00a0\nReduced antapical horn   Manumiella seelandica 21\u00a0\n\u00a0 7\n 1\u00a0\n* Refer to the dimensions of M. bertodano sp. nov. in the following text. 2\u00a0\n 3\u00a0\n5.

Firth 1987, and transitional 3\u00a0\nforms from Seymour Island exhibit a thin layer of mesophragm, hence the generic 4\u00a0\ndiagnosis needs emending to incorporate this feature (Figure 4 a-c, e-h and Figure 5 5\u00a0\na,c).  Mesophragm is a relatively rare morphological element that refers to any 6\u00a0\nintermediate cyst layers between the endophragm and periphragm.  In the samples 7\u00a0\nexamined, the least folded, and therefore easiest specimens to observe and 8\u00a0\nphotograph, commonly exhibited a mesophragm, which presumably increased the 9\u00a0\nrobustness of the cyst and retained its original outline.  A mesophragm was not 10\u00a0\nobserved in any M. seymourensis Askin 1999 specimens in these samples.  Habib and 11\u00a0\nSaeedi (2007, pl. I, fig. 1) also noted a three-layered wall in M. seelandica from a KT 12\u00a0\nsection in New Jersey (illustrated within a M. druggii morphotype specimen).  13\u00a0\nSimilarly, Soncini and Rauscher (1990, plate 1, fig.12) observed three wall layers in 14\u00a0\nLower Palaeocene M. cf. seelandica specimens from Morocco. 15\u00a0\n 16\u00a0\nManumiella bertodano new species 17\u00a0\nFigure 4 a-c 18\u00a0\nFull synonymy: 19\u00a0\n\u201cManumiella\u201d n. sp. 2 Askin 1988a, fig. 9.4 (not 9.5). 20\u00a0\n\u201cManumiella\u201d n. sp. 2 of Askin 1988a.

Roncaglia et al., 1999, fig. 16.9. 1\u00a0\nDescription:  2\u00a0\nDeflandreoid dinoflagellate cyst with an elongate, sub-pentagonal outline in 3\u00a0\ndorso-ventral view.  Periphragm relatively thin, smooth, microscabrate to finely 4\u00a0\ngranular in surface texture.  Circumcavate cyst organisation.  Epicyst and hypocyst 5\u00a0\napproximately equal in size.  Smooth, relatively thin mesophragm present in some 6\u00a0\nspecimens, occupying varying amounts of the pericoel and closely following the 7\u00a0\ninternal surface of the periphragm (commonly adjacent to it) for most of its outline.  8\u00a0\nThe mesophragm does not normally reach into the extremities of the horns.  9\u00a0\nEquatorial folding in the periphragm often suggests slight paracingulum development. 10\u00a0\nHowever, there are no unequivocal traces of paratabulation other than the archeopyle.   11\u00a0\nIntercalary monoplacoid periarcheopyle (Type I\/-\/-). Bilaterally symmetrical, iso- to 12\u00a0\nlati-deltaform hexa 2a, sub-rounded.  Free operculum. Prominent, sharply tapering 13\u00a0\napical horn with a pointed or rounded tip.  Two antapical horns are present, separated 14\u00a0\nby an intervening concavity.  The antapical horns are asymmetrical, the left antapical 15\u00a0\nhorn is more prominent, and is commonly distally pointed. The left antapical horn is 16\u00a0\nshorter than the apical horn, but is significantly longer than the right antapical horn, 17\u00a0\nwhich is typically reduced.  Endocyst smooth, relatively thick and prominent, ovoid in 18\u00a0\noutline, infrequently folded. 19\u00a0\nDimensions: Pericyst length 97(136)172 \u03bcm, standard deviation (sd) 19.4; pericyst 20\u00a0\nwidth 68(91)112 \u03bcm, sd 11.3; pericyst length to width ratio 1:0.65 to 1:0.70.  21\u00a0\nEndocyst length 37(68)88, sd 10.8 \u03bcm; endocyst width 32(76)95 \u03bcm, sd 13.4.  The 22\u00a0\nrange of apical horn length is not stated due to the difficulty of consistent 23\u00a0\nmeasurement between specimens with no sharp break in slope at the \u2018base\u2019 of the 24\u00a0\nhorn. 25\u00a0\n\u00a0 10\nThirty specimens measured. 1\u00a0\nEtymology: From the L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation, Seymour Island, from which 2\u00a0\nthis species was first illustrated by Askin (1988a). 3\u00a0\nHolotype: Specimen illustrated in Figure 4 c from slide D5.1237.1A, England Finder 4\u00a0\nco-ordinates L40-4.  Pericyst length 163 \u03bcm; pericyst width 88 \u03bcm (length to width 5\u00a0\nratio 1: 1.85). Endocyst length 68 \u03bcm; endocyst width 80 \u03bcm.  Mesophragm present. 6\u00a0\nIt is curated (under collection number D5.1237.1A; L40-4) in the collections of the 7\u00a0\nBritish Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, United Kingdom. 8\u00a0\nType locality and biostratigraphy: Stratigraphic level 959 m in L\u00f3pez de Bertodano 9\u00a0\nFormation composite section (equivalent to 10 m level in sub-section D5.222), 10\u00a0\nMarambio Group, Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula, late Maastrichtian.  11\u00a0\nIsabelidinium Superzone (Helby et al., 1987), Isabelidinium korojonense Range Zone 12\u00a0\nto Manumiella druggii Interval Zone (Helby et al., 1987). 13\u00a0\nRemarks and comparisons:  14\u00a0\nManumiella bertodano sp. nov. is distinguished by the combination of a 15\u00a0\nprominent endocyst, a tendency to an elongate, sub-pentagonal outline, a consistently 16\u00a0\nprominent apical horn, a large, distally-pointed left antapical horn and a reduced 17\u00a0\ntypically rounded right antapical horn.  Specimens of Manumiella bertodano sp. nov. 18\u00a0\noccur within the uppermost L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation on Seymour Island from 19\u00a0\n834 - 969 m (except rare, probably reworked specimens up to 995 m) in the section 20\u00a0\n(Figure 3).   21\u00a0\nAskin (1998a, fig. 9.4) first illustrated M. bertodano sp. nov. as \u201cManumiella\u201d n. 22\u00a0\nsp. 2.  However, Askin (1988a) did not describe this taxon.  Manumiella bertodano 23\u00a0\n\u00a0 11\nsp. nov. was also illustrated by Pirrie et al. (1991), Riding et al. (1992) and Roncaglia 1\u00a0\net al. (1999) from the late Maastrictian of Vega Island, Antarctica and New Zealand. 2\u00a0\nThe specimen of Manumiella  sp. 2 of Askin 1988a in Mohr and Mao (1997, pl. 1, 3\u00a0\nfig. 7) from the Maastrichtian of the Maud Rise off the coast of East Antarctica is 4\u00a0\nbicavate, and hence is not considered to be M. bertodano sp. nov.  The specimen of 5\u00a0\nMohr and Mao (1997, pl. 1, fig. 7) also has a short endocyst and a narrow antapical 6\u00a0\narea, lacks a particularly prominent apical horn, and is relatively small. 7\u00a0\nTransitional forms possessing most, but not all, of the characteristic features were 8\u00a0\nobserved by Askin (1988a, figs. 9.3, 9.5) and also during the current study (referred to 9\u00a0\nManumiella sp., Figure 4 d, e).  Marenssi et al. (2004, fig. 6F) figured a specimen that 10\u00a0\nappears to be transitional between M. bertodano sp. nov. and M. seelandica.  This is 11\u00a0\nwithin the \u201cManumiella complex\u201d from the Calafate Formation of southern Patagonia, 12\u00a0\nArgentina.  This specimen would here be designated Manumiella sp. because it does 13\u00a0\nnot directly satisfy the criteria for either of these two species. 14\u00a0\n 15\u00a0\nManumiella conorata (Stover 1973) Bujak and Davies 1983 16\u00a0\nFigure 4 f-i 17\u00a0\nSelected synonymy: 18\u00a0\nDeflandrea conorata Stover 1973, p. 171-172, fig. 3C, pl. 1, figs. 8a,b. 19\u00a0\nManumiella conorata (Stover 1973) Bujak and Davies 1983, p. 160. 20\u00a0\nManumiella n. sp. 1, Askin, 1988a, figs. 9.2 (not 9.1). 21\u00a0\n 22\u00a0\n\u00a0 12\nRemarks:   1\u00a0\nManumiella conorata was described as \u201clozenge-shaped\u201d with slightly convex 2\u00a0\nand rounded lateral margins of relatively large size (Stover, 1973, p.171).  3\u00a0\nCharacteristic features include a short, usually blunt, weakly to moderately developed 4\u00a0\napical horn and rounded, asymmetrical, \u201cfairly well differentiated\u201d antapical horns.  5\u00a0\nThe larger left antapical horn may be more pointed than the smaller right horn.  The 6\u00a0\nendocyst occupies the majority of the pericoel, and is circumcavate.  Within the 7\u00a0\nuppermost L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation of Seymour Island, unequivocal M. 8\u00a0\nconorata was observed in relatively high numbers, at only at 959 m in the composite 9\u00a0\nsection. This is 70m stratigraphically below the KT boundary (Table 1, Figure 3).  10\u00a0\nThe specimens of M. conorata from Seymour Island are smaller than the type material 11\u00a0\nof Stover (1973) (Table 2). 12\u00a0\nOne of the two specimens of Manumiella n. sp. 1 from the L\u00f3pez de Bertodano 13\u00a0\nFormation of Seymour Island illustrated by Askin (1988a, fig. 9.2) is conspecific with 14\u00a0\nM. conorata. This is corroborated here using the new taxonomic key.  The other 15\u00a0\nspecimen of Manumiella n. sp. 1 illustrated by Askin (1988a, fig. 9.1) is attributed 16\u00a0\nhere to Manumiella sp. because it exhibits transitional features between M. bertodano 17\u00a0\nsp. nov. and M. conorata.  Marenssi et al. (2004) recorded a \u2018Manumiella complex\u2019 in 18\u00a0\nthe Maastrichtian Calafate Formation of southern Patagonia, Argentina. Some 19\u00a0\nspecimens of this plexus compare well with Manumiella n. sp. 1 of Askin (1988a).  20\u00a0\nThese specimens were not illustrated. 21\u00a0\n 22\u00a0\nManumiella druggii (Stover 1973) Bujak and Davies 1983 23\u00a0\nFigure 4 j,k 24\u00a0\n\u00a0 13\nSelected synonymy: 1\u00a0\nDeflandrea cretacea Cookson 1956.

Habib and Saeedi, 9\u00a0\n2007, pl. 1, figs. 1-3 (only), pl. 2, fig. 3 (only). 10\u00a0\nRemarks:  11\u00a0\nStover (1973) originally described M. druggii as broadly elliptical in outline, 12\u00a0\nrarely elongate, with poorly developed antapical horns separated by a shallow 13\u00a0\nconcavity.  The periphragm may be smooth to finely granulate in texture and exhibits 14\u00a0\na relatively small archeopyle with an antapically-hinged operculum.  The endocyst 15\u00a0\noccupies a major part of the pericoel, is circumcavate, commonly folded and generally 16\u00a0\ncircular in outline.  The apex may be rounded or bear a short and blunt apical horn.  In 17\u00a0\nthe L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation on Seymour Island, M. druggii was observed in 18\u00a0\nthe 40 m below the KT boundary (Figure 3). 19\u00a0\nLange (1969, pl. I, figs. 1-5) illustrated five peridinioid specimens that, although 20\u00a0\ndescribed as Deflandrea cretacea Cookson 1956 (now Manumiella? cretacea 21\u00a0\n(Cookson 1956) Bujak and Davies 1983), are considered to be conspecific with 22\u00a0\nManumiella druggii.  Furthermore, the size of the material of Lange (1969) (mean 23\u00a0\n\u00a0 15\nlength and width 104 and 74 \u03bcm respectively) is consistent with the type material of 1\u00a0\nM. druggii.  This is 104-122 \u03bcm long and 92-103 \u03bcm wide (Stover, 1973).  Stover 2\u00a0\n(1973) stated that M. druggii is distinguished from D. cretacea by being circumcavate 3\u00a0\nand twice the size (Wilson, 1978). The overall length and width of D. cretacea is 45-4\u00a0\n65 \u03bcm and 43-56 \u03bcm respectively (Cookson, 1956).  Stover (1973) noted that a 5\u00a0\nspecimen of Drugg (1967, pl. 2, fig. 17), identified as D. cretacea, is probably 6\u00a0\nconspecific with M. druggii. Wilson (1978) discussed the differentiation of 7\u00a0\nDeflandrea (Manumiella?) cretacea from Isabelia (Manumiella) druggii in detail.  8\u00a0\nThe distinction between these two taxa is important because the stratigraphic range of 9\u00a0\nthe former is significantly older (mid Santonian to early Maastrichtian) than the latter 10\u00a0\n(Helby et al., 1987). 11\u00a0\nWilson (1978) also discussed variation in the apical region of Isabelia 12\u00a0\n(Manumiella) druggii, and separated those with an apical horn (\u2018small tuberculate or 13\u00a0\nconical protuberance to a relatively long, tapered, pointed horn, often capped by a 14\u00a0\nsolid papilla\u2019) into Isabelia (now Manumiella) seelandica.  This restricted M. druggii 15\u00a0\nto specimens with rounded or sub-rounded apices.  Wilson (1978) conceded that the 16\u00a0\ntwo species are \u2018very closely related\u2019 due to their \u2018virtually identical\u2019 dimensions and 17\u00a0\nsimilar overall shape and morphology apart from the apex. An illustration of 18\u00a0\nManumiella sp. cf. M. druggii in Askin (1988a) was compared to the species due to its 19\u00a0\ntruncated apex, but this seems an unduly cautious assignment and appears to fit well 20\u00a0\nwithin the range of variation of this species concept.  Eshet et al. (1992, pl. II, fig. 4) 21\u00a0\nillustrated a specimen of Manumiella sp. from a KT section at Hor Hahar, Israel, 22\u00a0\nwhich compares well with the holotype. 23\u00a0\nMarenssi et al. (2004, figs. 6c,d) retained M. druggii as a separate species to M. 24\u00a0\nseelandica, and illustrated two relatively granulate specimens from the Maastrichtian 25\u00a0\n\u00a0 16\nCalafate Formation of southern Patagonia.  They also illustrated two specimens of 1\u00a0\nManumiella sp. (Marenssi et al., 2004, figs. 6a,b); these are assigned to M. druggii 2\u00a0\nbased on the new taxonomic key above.  Marenssi et al. (2004, fig. 6a) has a dimpled 3\u00a0\napex with poorly developed antapical horns. The other specimen (Marenssi et al., 4\u00a0\n2004, fig. 6b) closely resembles M. druggii, despite being relatively elongate in 5\u00a0\noutline, with an incipient antapical horn in the form of a slight protrusion.  Stover 6\u00a0\n(1973) noted rare elongation in outline in his original description, which may be a 7\u00a0\nresult of lateral compression.  The Manumiella sp. in Marenssi et al. (2004, fig. 6b) is 8\u00a0\nslightly folded. 9\u00a0\n 10\u00a0\nManumiella seelandica (Lange 1969) Bujak and Davies 1983 emend.

Habib and Saeedi, 10\u00a0\n2007, pl. 1, fig. 4 (only), pl. 2, figs. 1,2,4 (only). 11\u00a0\nRemarks:  12\u00a0\nLange (1969) established this species as Broomea seelandica and described it as 13\u00a0\nhaving an oval to rhombic outline, a finely granulate periphragm, and a square to 14\u00a0\nrectangular archaeopyle.  The epicyst has a truncated or pointed apical horn and the 15\u00a0\nlarger hypocyst a smaller antapical horn.  Habib and Saeedi (2007) noted a 16\u00a0\ncharacteristically ovoid endocyst with a flattened, rounded triangular apex, wider than 17\u00a0\nit is high.  In this study Manumiella seelandica occurs only in the uppermost L\u00f3pez de 18\u00a0\nBertodano Formation (949-1025 m in the composite section), immediately underlying 19\u00a0\nthe KT boundary (Figure 3). 20\u00a0\nStover (1973) suggested that the specimen with a poorly-developed apical horn 21\u00a0\nand a reduced antapical horn illustrated by Cookson (1956, pl. 1, fig. 5) as Deflandrea 22\u00a0\ncretacea is Manumiella druggii. However, this specimen corresponds more closely 23\u00a0\n\u00a0 18\nwith Manumiella seelandica using the taxonomic key herein.  Furthermore, specimens 1\u00a0\nreferred to Deflandrea cretacea from the Late Cretaceous of the New Jersey coastal 2\u00a0\nplain (Koch and Olsson, 1977, text-figs. 3[2,3]) are closer to Manumiella seelandica 3\u00a0\n(sensu Lange) using the key. Similarly, Eshet et al. (1992, pl. III, fig. 3) illustrated a 4\u00a0\nspecimen with a distinct, short, distally-pointed antapical horn as Manumiella druggii.  5\u00a0\nThis specimen appears to be Manumiella seelandica.  In a study of the Cretaceous-6\u00a0\nPalaeogene transition of Mead Stream, Marlborough, New Zealand, Strong et al. 7\u00a0\n(1995, fig. 13(1)) recorded both Manumiella druggii and Manumiella seelandica. 8\u00a0\nThese authors illustrated one specimen as Manumiella cf. seelandica, which appears 9\u00a0\nto be conspecific with the type material.  10\u00a0\nDue to morphological continuities in the complex of forms between the 11\u00a0\nManumiella seelandica and Manumiella druggii species concepts, individual 12\u00a0\nspecimens in previous studies have either been identified as one or other of the 13\u00a0\nseparate species. An example of this is Wilson (1978) who uses both Isabelia 14\u00a0\nseelandica and Isabelia druggii; others are specimens identified as Manumiella 15\u00a0\nseelandica that encompassing forms ranging between the two end members of 16\u00a0\nseelandica- and druggii-types (e.g. Stover, 1973; Fensome and Williams, 2004).   17\u00a0\nBujak and Davies (1983) retained both Manumiella seelandica and Manumiella 18\u00a0\ndruggii within their new genus Manumiella, nominating Manumiella seelandica as the 19\u00a0\ntype species.  Askin (1988a, figs. 9.7, 9.9) recognised both species.  In the present 20\u00a0\nstudy, recognition of key morphological distinctions aided by the new taxonomic key 21\u00a0\nare considered sufficient and consistent enough to retain the two separate species.   22\u00a0\nFirth (1987), however, studied the Maastrichtian and Danian of Georgia, U.S.A. 23\u00a0\nand considered the range of variability within Manumiella seelandica (sensu Wilson, 24\u00a0\n1978) to be greater than that between Manumiella seelandica and Manumiella druggii 25\u00a0\n\u00a0 19\nand hence considered the former to be a senior synonym of the latter.  Firth (1987, pl. 1\u00a0\n2, fig. 1) illustrated a specimen that would be classified herein as Manumiella druggii.  2\u00a0\nThe other specimens (Firth, 1987, pl. 2, figs. 2-6) are referable to Manumiella 3\u00a0\nseelandica. Soncini and Rauscher (1990), Fensome and Williams (2004) and Habib 4\u00a0\nand Saeedi (2007) also considered Manumiella seelandica to be a taxonomic senior 5\u00a0\nsynonym of Manumiella druggii. The \u201cManumiella seelandica morphotype\u201d of Habib 6\u00a0\nand Saeedi (2007, pl. I, fig. 4; pl. II, figs. 1,2,4) was considered to be variation within 7\u00a0\nthe concept of Manumiella seelandica by these authors. 8\u00a0\n 9\u00a0\nManumiella seymourensis Askin 1999 10\u00a0\nFigure 5 d-j 11\u00a0\n 12\u00a0\nFull synonymy: 13\u00a0\nGen. et sp. indet. 1 Palamarczuk et al., 1984, pl 1, fig. 2. 14\u00a0\nManumiella n. sp. 3 Askin, 1988a, figs. 8.4-8.6. 15\u00a0\nManumiella n. sp. 3 of Askin, 1988a.

Roncaglia, 2000, fig. 5I. 3\u00a0\nRemarks:  4\u00a0\nThe characteristic feature of M. seymourensis is the thin, virtually invisible 5\u00a0\nendocyst.  It has a relatively large intercalary periarcheopyle, commonly with the 6\u00a0\noperculum still attached, and is typically ovoid in outline.  The pericyst wall is smooth 7\u00a0\nand relatively thick. On Seymour Island M. seymourensis is present in the lower part 8\u00a0\nof the uppermost L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation and the range top is above 870 m in 9\u00a0\nthe composite section (approximately 200 m below the KT boundary, Figure 3).  Rare 10\u00a0\nand somewhat torn specimens, which are probably reworked, occur up to 931 m. 11\u00a0\nThe apical and antapical areas of M. seymourensis typically lack horns.  These 12\u00a0\nmorphotypes are either truncated or rounded, often with dimples; for example, Smith 13\u00a0\n(1992, fig. 7k) and Roncaglia (2000, fig. 5I, p. 141).  Other forms exhibit single, 14\u00a0\nprominent polar horns (Askin, 1988a, figs. 8.5, 8.6; 1999, figs. 3.1-3.4).  In this study, 15\u00a0\nhorned specimens are rare compared to hornless forms, with no apparent stratigraphic 16\u00a0\npattern within the L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation in the occurrence of these 17\u00a0\nmorphotypes.  The relative rarity of the horned end-members, the overall similarity of 18\u00a0\nthe remainder of the pericyst, and the lack of any apparent stratigraphic significance 19\u00a0\nto horn development suggest that all these variations should not given subspecific 20\u00a0\nstatus, and hence are all retained within the specific diagnosis.   21\u00a0\n 22\u00a0\n6. Discussion 23\u00a0\n\u00a0 21\n 1\u00a0\nBiostratigraphical significance 2\u00a0\nThe species of Manumiella from Seymour Island are useful biostratigraphic 3\u00a0\nmarkers due to their abundance and diversity within the late Maastrichtian L\u00f3pez de 4\u00a0\nBertodano Formation.  Using the preliminary biozonation scheme of Askin (1988a), 5\u00a0\nthe interval of approximately 280m up to the KT boundary can be divided into Zones 6\u00a0\n2 to 4, passing into Zone 5 in the earliest Palaeocene sediments (Figure 3).    7\u00a0\nManumiella seymourensis is present in the lower part of the composite section up 8\u00a0\nto around 870 m, with occasional reworked specimens present up to approximately 9\u00a0\n930 m.  Zone 2 of Askin (1988a) is characterised by abundant Manumiella 10\u00a0\nseymourensis, with occasional reworked specimens appearing in Zone 3.  This places 11\u00a0\nthe Zone 2\/Zone 3 boundary in the current section at 870 m (Figure 3).  Manumiella 12\u00a0\nbertodano sp. nov. is present from 834 m in the composite section, defining the lower 13\u00a0\nboundary of the upper subzone of Zone 2.  The upper limit of M. bertodano sp. nov. at 14\u00a0\n969 m, in addition to the first appearance of M. druggii at 989 m, defines the Zone 15\u00a0\n3\/Zone 4 boundary at approximately 979 m.  Askin (1988a) however, attributed a 16\u00a0\nlonger range to M. bertodano sp. nov. to the top of her Zone 4 (i.e. the KT boundary) 17\u00a0\nthan was observed in this study.  Askin (1988a, b) considered M. druggii to be an 18\u00a0\nimportant marker species of her Zone 4 from Seymour Island, and noted its 19\u00a0\noccurrence in other latest Maastrichtian sequences (e.g. Drugg, 1967; Hultberg, 1986).  20\u00a0\nManumiella conorata and M. seelandica occur above 959 m, coincident with 21\u00a0\nabundance peaks of M. bertodano sp. nov., M. spp. and the closely-related 22\u00a0\nIsabelidinium spp.  This acme is probably related to environmental change.  23\u00a0\nThe species of Manumiella discussed herein are regarded as reliable 24\u00a0\nbiostratigraphic markers for the late Maastrichtian of the Southern Hemisphere (e.g. 25\u00a0\n\u00a0 22\nYepes, 2001; Olivero et al., 2002).  The \u201cIsabelidinium\u201d druggii Zone of latest 1\u00a0\nHaumurian-earliest Teurian age (late Maastrichtian-early Danian) is defined in New 2\u00a0\nZealand by the ranges of M. druggii and M. seelandica (Wilson, 1978, 1984).  Helby 3\u00a0\net al. (1987) used the ranges of M. conorata, M. druggii and M. seelandica to define a 4\u00a0\nlate Maastrichtian to earliest Danian Manumiella druggii Interval Zone in Australia.  5\u00a0\nFurthermore, Askin (1988b) noted that the M. druggii-M. seelandica complex are 6\u00a0\npresent approximately 10 m into the Palaeocene in her Seymour Island section, 7\u00a0\nalthough they disappear at the KT boundary in this study.  8\u00a0\nMao and Mohr (1992) and Mohr and Mao (1997) extend the range of Manumiella 9\u00a0\ntaxa into the early and mid Maastrichtian.  Mohr and Mao (1997) recorded 10\u00a0\nM.bertodano sp. nov. (as Manumiella sp. 2 of Askin, 1988a) from the early 11\u00a0\nMaastrichtian at ODP Site 690, Maud Rise in the Weddell Sea area off the east 12\u00a0\nAntarctic coast, and from ODP Site 748 on the Kerguelen Plateau.  Mohr and Mao 13\u00a0\n(1997, fig. 7) suggested the range for this taxon is from latest Campanian to the KT 14\u00a0\nboundary (Text-fig. 7), and then inconsistently state in the text (p. 52) that the last 15\u00a0\nappearance datum of M. sp. 2 may be located near the Campanian\/Maastrichtian 16\u00a0\nboundary.  The specimen of M. bertodano sp. nov. illustrated by these authors is a 17\u00a0\nmis-identification (see above).  Manumiella sp. 2 (Askin, 1988a) of Mohr and Mao 18\u00a0\n(1997, pl. 1, fig. 7) is clearly a specimen of Isabelidinium.   19\u00a0\n 20\u00a0\nPalaeoecology 21\u00a0\nThe peridinioid genus Manumiella spp. and related forms are considered to be 22\u00a0\ntypical of relatively near-shore, inner-shelf marine environments (e.g. Askin, 1988a; 23\u00a0\nAskin and Jacobson, 1996; Habib and Saeedi, 2007).  Morphological development 24\u00a0\nwithin Manumiella may reflect cyst evolution in response to varying water depths.  25\u00a0\n\u00a0 23\nFor example, Askin (1988a) related an increase in horn development in M. 1\u00a0\nseymourensis to palaeoenvironmental change such as a basinal deepening then 2\u00a0\nshallowing during the latest Maastrichtian on Seymour Island, in conjunction with the 3\u00a0\nsimultaneous appearance of M. bertodano sp. nov.  Furthermore, within the L\u00f3pez de 4\u00a0\nBertodano Formation on Seymour Island, Askin (1999) noted that M. seymourensis 5\u00a0\noccurs with a great abundance of the small, acanthomorph acritarch genus 6\u00a0\nMicrhystridium spp., which has been interpreted as representing near-shore 7\u00a0\nenvironments, perhaps inner neritic, but still open water, transgressive facies (Wall, 8\u00a0\n1965; Downie et al., 1971; Firth, 1987).   9\u00a0\nIn this study, the ranges of M. seymourensis and Micrhystridium spp. do not 10\u00a0\ncoincide.  This suggests slightly different environmental preferences and a potentially 11\u00a0\nsignificant change in the depositional environment of the basin at 831 m where 12\u00a0\nMicrhystridium spp. abundance decreases markedly (Figure 3).  Significantly, there is 13\u00a0\nan abrupt peak of Manumiella and Isabelidinium spp. at 959 m in the composite 14\u00a0\nsection, ~70m below the KT boundary, and a similar one at 1015 m, around 15m 15\u00a0\nbelow the KT.  The reason for acmes at these horizons is unclear (there are no 16\u00a0\nsignificant features in the sedimentology) but it is likely that an abrupt marine 17\u00a0\npalaeoecological change, perhaps indicating short-term sea-level change prior to the 18\u00a0\nKT, favoured the habitat preferences of this particular group and reflect a change in 19\u00a0\nnutrient availability, water temperature or chemistry.   20\u00a0\nOthers have noted the phenomenon of Manumiella \u2018spikes\u2019 immediately prior to 21\u00a0\nthe KT. For example, Habib and Saeedi (2007) reported a Manumiella seelandica 22\u00a0\nspike, interpreted as representing a mild cooling and regression in the New Jersey 23\u00a0\nsection immediately prior to the KT catastrophe.  A Manumiella spp. spike (mostly 24\u00a0\nManumiella seelandica) has also been recognised elsewhere, both in the Northern and 25\u00a0\n\u00a0 24\nSouthern Hemispheres (e.g. Drugg, 1967; Firth, 1987; Eshet et al., 1992; Moshkovitz 1\u00a0\nand Habib, 1993; N\u00f8hr-Hansen and Dam, 1997; Oboh-Ikuenobe et al., 1998; 2\u00a0\nPalamarczuk, 2004; Przemyslaw, 2004).  Askin (1988b) and Elliot et al. (1994) also 3\u00a0\nreported similar acmes as part of KT boundary studies on Seymour Island.  This spike 4\u00a0\nof abundance suggests that conditions in the latest Cretaceous shelf seas were already 5\u00a0\nchanging significantly prior to the KT environment change. 6\u00a0\nEvidence is accumulating for significant global eustatic sea level changes during 7\u00a0\nthe latest Cretaceous based on multi-proxy analyses of both outcrop and drill-core 8\u00a0\nsequences.  Barrera and Savin (1999) noted an episode of high positive benthic 9\u00a0\nforaminiferal \u03b418O values between 67.5 and 65.4 Ma from southern high-latitude 10\u00a0\nOcean Drilling Program Sites 689-690 (South Atlantic), which correlated with a 11\u00a0\nsignificant regression in the Haq et al. (1987) eustatic sea-level curve.  Further, Li et 12\u00a0\nal. (2000) reported several sea-level fluctuations in a Campanian to Palaeocene 13\u00a0\nsequence in Tunisia, four of which are recognised globally, suggesting a eustatic 14\u00a0\nsignature, (including a short-term regression during the latest Maastrichtian, 65.45-15\u00a0\n65.3 Ma). Significant and rapid sea level changes during the Late Cretaceous have 16\u00a0\nalso been reconstructed from the Russian platform and New Jersey passive margin 17\u00a0\nusing backstripping techniques on sedimentary sequences (Sahagian et al., 1996; 18\u00a0\nMiller et al., 2005).  The New Jersey record contains large (>25m) and rapid (<1 myr) 19\u00a0\neustatic sea-level drops, paced by Milankovitch orbital cyclicities (Miller et al., 2003, 20\u00a0\n2005; Kominz et al., 2003; Van Sickel et al., 2004).  Miller et al. (2005) infer a 21\u00a0\nglacioeustatic origin for these sea-level changes because of their global occurrence 22\u00a0\nand the rapidity and magnitude of change, which is interesting due to their occurrence 23\u00a0\nduring the Cretaceous global \u2018greenhouse\u2019 climate.  The Manumiella and 24\u00a0\n\u00a0 25\nIsabelidinium spikes of abundance from Seymour Island may correlate with these 1\u00a0\nperiods of global regression but requires further work and precise dating. 2\u00a0\n 3\u00a0\n7. Conclusions 4\u00a0\nNew work on the late Maastrichtian species of Manumiella from the James Ross 5\u00a0\nBasin has highlighted the biostratigraphical and palaeoecological significance of this 6\u00a0\ngroup, both in this basin and worldwide, in particular with reference to changes 7\u00a0\nassociated with the KT boundary.  Observations on hundreds of specimens throughout 8\u00a0\na thick section of the latest Maastrichtian L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation on Seymour 9\u00a0\nIsland have allowed clearer definitions of five taxa to allow consistency in analytical 10\u00a0\nrecording.  As a result,  Manumiella has been emended to include the presence of a 11\u00a0\nmesophragm, and M. bertodano sp. nov. has been formally described.  A new 12\u00a0\ntaxonomic key has been erected to aid identification of five Manumiella taxa (M. 13\u00a0\nbertodano sp. nov., M. conorata, M. druggii, M. seelandica and M. seymourensis). 14\u00a0\nThe success of the key has been illustrated by a quantitative palynological study from 15\u00a0\nthe sediments of the L\u00f3pez de Bertodano Formation, indicating how Manumiella is 16\u00a0\nkey to subdividing the sequence into biozones based on the scheme of Askin (1988a). 17\u00a0\nThe peridinioid genus Manumiella spp. may be typical of relatively near-shore, 18\u00a0\ninner-shelf marine environments with morphological evolution of the cyst responding 19\u00a0\nto changing water depths.  Peaks in abundance of Manumiella (and closely related 20\u00a0\nIsabelidinium) noted from Seymour Island may indicate short-term regressions and\/or 21\u00a0\nocean cooling prior to the KT.  Similar \u2018spikes\u2019 in abundance of Manumiella 22\u00a0\nassociated with the KT boundary elsewhere in the world have also been related to 23\u00a0\nmild cooling and regression.  This work contributes to increasing evidence of 24\u00a0\n\u00a0 26\nsignificant sea level change during the Maastrichtian, possibly related to glacioeustasy 1\u00a0\nduring cooling climates after the mid-Cretaceous greenhouse.  2\u00a0\n 3\u00a0\nAcknowledgements 4\u00a0\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the Natural Environment Research Council 5\u00a0\nAntarctic Funding Initiative grant NE\/C506399\/1 entitled \u2018Terminal Cretaceous 6\u00a0\nclimate change and biotic response in Antarctica\u2019.
