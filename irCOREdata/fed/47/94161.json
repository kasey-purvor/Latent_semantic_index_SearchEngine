In an attempt to move \nbeyond this debate, which is focused on whether certain ethnic minorities are over-represented in the \nprison population because of elevated rates of offending or because of discriminatory treatment in the \ncriminal justice system, this paper proposes the formulation of minority perspectives in criminology.  \nThese would be concerned with empirical, theoretical, practical and policy issues and address matters of \nrepresentation, knowledge production, the historical contextualisation of minority experiences in theory \ndevelopment, and the ethical duties of criminologists working within a minority perspective. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank David Downes, Bonny Mhlanga, Karim Murji, Ken Pease, Katheryn Russell and \nAndy Zurawan for their helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper. \n 2\nStating the case for minority perspectives \n References to \u2018race\u2019 and ethnicity are commonplace in empirical criminology. As key socio-\ndemographic variables empirical criminologists routinely use them to describe victims of crime and \noffenders, and less commonly, criminal justice practitioners. At the theoretical level, the notion of \u2018race\u2019 \nor ethnicity has infused many schools of criminological thought throughout the history of the discipline. \nMuch of the focus of this empirical and theoretical attention has centred on official statistics which \nreveal an overrepresentation of certain minorities among those arrested and imprisoned for some \ncriminal offences. On the other hand, self-report studies of offending and drug use have challenged the \nvalidity of these empirical \u2018facts\u2019, as have studies which have documented discrimination in criminal \njustice processing (see Bowling and Phillips 2002). Nevertheless, Braithwaite (1989: 44) has contended \nthat a credible criminological theory ought to be able to explain, among other things, elevated rates of \noffending (according to official statistics) among oppressed racial minorities, since this is one of several \n\u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cconsistently supported associations in empirical criminology\u201d.  \n A primary objective in formulating minority perspectives in criminology is to move beyond the so-\ncalled \u2018race and crime\u2019 debate that has preoccupied us. It is the need to refine this debate, extend its \nparameters, and to raise concerns about the nature of the discipline itself which has spurred us to \npropose a different approach. Taking our cue from Braithwaite (1989) it is clear that there are many \nother \u201cconsistently supported observations\u201d in this subfield, which hitherto have been neglected by \nmainstream criminology. The findings that black people have been disproportionately the victims of \nexcessive physical force by police, prison and immigration officers and to die in custody, that almost all \n 3\njudges are white even though a significant minority of those who appear before them are not, that Asian \npeople have lower rates of imprisonment than white and black people, that there are few senior minority \ncriminologists in the UK, are but a selection of such observations (Bowling and Phillips 2002). This \nremark should not be seen, however, as a rallying call for the development of an over-arching theory \nwhich can explain all of these phenomena, although there are likely to be common explanatory themes; \nthe point is simply that criminological theory should not solely be dominated by the polemical and now \nsterile debate centred on elevated rates of offending versus discriminatory criminal justice processing. \n A more multi-dimensional approach to understanding minorities\u2019 experience of victimisation, \noffending, criminal justice processing and working within the criminal justice field is necessary. A \nstarting point is the need to reconcile criminological data with the 'lived experiences' and subjectivities of \nminorities. This is crystallised by Shallice and Gordon (1990: 31) when they refer to the disjuncture \nbetween empirical research findings on sentencing practices which show no \u2018race effect\u2019 and \u201cthe large \nnumbers of people who readily assert the opposite, largely (though not unimportantly) on the basis of \nanecdotal, personal and collective experience.\u201d Similarly striking were the differences in perspective \nexpressed during the evidence taken in the Inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. On the one \nhand, representatives from minority communities \u2013 churches, community relations councils, local \nmonitoring groups and activists \u2013  referred to their experiences of racist violence, the weakness of the \npolice response to this victimisation, and oppressive policing. On the other hand, senior police officers \nmade reference to how seriously they viewed racist violence, describing initiatives in place to respond to \nthis victimisation, and evidence showing either increased public confidence in the police (evidenced by \nincreases in reported incidents) or a decrease in the extent of the problem (evidenced by decreases in \n 4\n                                                \nreported incidents) (Macpherson Inquiry 1999).  \n Reconciling these conflicting perspectives can be partially achieved through both improvements in \nthe collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of such criminological data and by making \ncentral to our understanding the knowledges provided by minority communities themselves. This, \nhowever, does not go far enough. There must also be a critical deconstruction of the process of \nknowledge production about minorities, which in its current state means squaring up to the discipline of \ncriminology itself1. These can be addressed through the formulation of minority perspectives in \ncriminology which operate at the level of empirical data collection, theoretical development, practice and \npolicy formulation.  \n In explicating a distinctive minority perspective for British criminology, our framework builds on \nthat proposed by Katheryn Russell (1992) in developing a \u2018black criminology\u2019 in the United States. The \ntwin crises of an under-developed theoretical criminology around race and the under-representation of \nminorities in the discipline referred to by Russell are echoed in the British experience. A second major \ninfluence for this paper has been the development of feminist perspectives in criminology. Can the \ncanon of criminological theories be adequately applied to minorities\u2019 experiences assuming \u2018white\u2019 is  \n \n \n \n1  In time, other sources of knowledge or \u2018truths\u2019 about minority experience will need to be scrutinised; those with currency at \npresent are those primarily within administrative and academic criminology and cultural studies.  \n 5\nthe norm or standard against which minorities are to be judged? Is there evidence of institutional racism \nin the criminal justice system and the discipline? What is the role of ethnicity (\u2018whiteness\u2019, \u2018blackness\u2019, \n\u2018Asianess\u2019, or some \u2018otherness\u2019) in explaining offending, victimisation and criminal justice practices? \nThese are all questions previously raised by feminist criminologists in conceptualising women\u2019s \nexperiences in mainstream criminology (Gelsthorpe and Morris 1990; Morris and Gelsthorpe 1991).  \nThe time is ripe for these questions to be explored in relation to \u2018race\u2019 and ethnicity.  \n \nIntellectual caution: the criminological taboo, essentialism and the thorny issue of \nrepresentation \n Before discussing some of the directions for minority perspectives in criminology, a few words of \ncaution and clarification are necessary. Russell\u2019s (1992: 669) discussion of the twin crises facing US \ncriminology is prefaced with a discussion of the \u201clong-standing criminological taboo against discussing \nany relationship between race and crime\u201d (Russell 1992: 669). It can be traced back to genetic theorising \nand the Moynihan Report of 1965 which was seen as pathologising female-headed black families and \nblaming them for high levels of crime and delinquency. While acknowledging the reluctance of \nminorities to engage with these issues because of the negative history of race and crime research and the \ninadequacy of minority rights in the US, Russell laments the neglect of this important area.  \n We share these concerns, not least because of the overwhelming evidence of criminalisation \namong certain minority groups in Britain (see Bowling and Phillips 2002). Yet it is essential for \ncriminologists to examine critically official data on offending (such as arrest and imprisonment rates) \n 6\nsince these are commonly taken, regardless of their well-documented flaws, as \u2018facts\u2019 about \u2018ethnic\u2019 or \n\u2018black crime\u2019. While we agree that such data relating to offending within minority communities are of \nquestionable validity and is probably worthless in isolation, ignoring it needs to be balanced against the \nconcerns that serious crimes have generated within minority communities themselves (see for example \nThe Voice 22 May 2000: 1-3). Whilst there appears to be no taboo concerning the relationship between \nethnicity and crime among the lay criminologies articulated by the media, criminological analyses in the \nUK have, like their US counterparts, avoided detailed explorations of the inter-relationships between \nethnicity, racism, crime and other aspects of social and economic life. Nevertheless, we are sensitive to \nthe dilemma of engaging with debates about minority victimisation and offending and contributing to \nthe creation of false pathologies which might then serve to naturalise and reify images of certain \nminorities as inherently criminal, the risk of \u201ccollusion and treachery-by-default\u201d referred to by \nAlexander (2000: 227).  \n A central component of a minority perspective in criminology is to embrace difference by moving \nbeyond crude and essentialist categorisations of racial and ethnic minorities. The \u2018new ethnicities\u2019 \nliterature, for example, has stressed the need to move beyond a black-white dualism in conceptualising \ndifference and understanding cultural hybridity in the post-colonial period. In the 1990s both hegemonic \n\u2018black\u2019 and \u2018Asian\u2019 identities have been politically contested because of diverse historical, cultural, \npolitical, religious and socio-economic experiences among minorities in Britain. As Stuart Hall (1988: \n258) argues, individuals \u201cspeak from a particular place, out of a particular history, out of a particular \nexperience, a particular culture\u201d, but they should not be contained by that position. We think this should \nbe taken into account in any research endeavour; examining \u2018unities within diversity\u2019 is our preferred \n 7\n                                                \napproach2. However, Sharma (1996) warns against a celebration of difference and marginality which fails \nto take account of racism, violence, the dominant structures of power and global and national socio-\neconomic inequalities, which, as Spivak (1989, 1993) notes, structures the forms in which the \u2018voices\u2019 of \nminorities can be heard. Neither should this approach obscure the importance of other subjectivities \nsuch as gender, class, ethnicity, sexuality and religion (see also Smart 1990; Rice 1990; Daly and Stephens \n1995). \n This, in part, explains why we advocate the terminology of a 'minority' perspective. We have \nrejected the term \u2018black criminology\u2019 used by Russell in the US and Rice (1990)3 in the British context, \nbecause of its contested validity as a unifying identity for Britain\u2019s racial and ethnic minorities (see \nModood 1988, 1997). We have also rejected the use of the British equivalent of \u2018African-American \nperspectives\u2019 (for example African-Caribbean) as used by Young and Sulton (1996), in part because it \nrepresents an exclusive focus on one minority group. Instead we adopt Takagi\u2019s (1981) and Mann\u2019s \n(1993) usage of \u2018minority\u2019, since this recognises and emphasises the marginal and excluded status of both \n \n \n2  Of course, some research necessarily requires aggregation. Large-scale surveys such as the British Crime Survey, for \nexample, have attempted to disentangle the victimisation experiences of people of Indian origin from those of Pakistani and \nBangladeshi origin, despite the challenge of small sub-sample sizes (see for example, Kershaw et al 2000). Less successful has \nbeen the disaggregation of the \u2018black\u2019 ethnic group which encompasses those whose ethnic origin is from the Caribbean or \nAfrica, and a significant group categorised as Black Other who, on at least one criterion, imprisonment, appear to have quite \ndistinctive experiences (see Home Office 2000). \n3 Rice (1990) provides a critique of 'black criminology' in Britain, which is identified as the body of work on criminality and \nrace undertaken by black and white criminologists\/sociologists, but which has exclusively focused on the causes of crime \namong black men, or their treatment within the criminal justice system, and has not discussed the experiences of black women. \n 8\n                                                                                                                                                            \nvisible and other racial and ethnic minorities. Although not the focus of this paper, the term also allows a \nconsideration of other minority groups\u2019 experiences as gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, transsexual, or \ntransgendered people.   \n This leads us to consider representation in minority criminological perspectives. For Russell (1992) \na black criminology should, at least initially, be the preserve of black criminologists. The rationale for this \nis that black criminologists, unlike their \u2018nonblack\u2019 counterparts, have a familiarity and understanding of \nblack community experience which will bring legitimacy to the subfield (see also Young and Sulton 1996 \nfor a more forceful statement on this; and Ferdinand 1994). In time when it has become established, \nRussell asserts that a black criminology will need white academics\/researchers to maintain its \nmomentum4. Their role will also be essential in undertaking certain types of research with white people, \nsuch as perpetrators of racist harassment and violence. \n \n Recognising the pioneering role of black criminologists in formulating a black criminology may \nalso go some way to reversing the under-representation of blacks in the discipline to which Russell also \nmakes reference. It should also help to address any resentment that minorities may feel about white \nacademics being the only experts on issues relating to \u2018race\u2019 and ethnicity (see Rosaldo 1989; Sharma, \n \n \n4  Similarly, Parham (1993), for example, has acknowledged the need for white psychologists to advocate a culturally diverse \nperspective, for if it is just minority psychologists doing so, they can easily be dismissed or marginalised by white \npsychologists. \n 9\nHutnyk and Sharma 1996; Parham 1993; Mio and Iwamasa 1993; Stanfield 1993 in relation to cultural \nstudies and anthropology, psychology, and sociology). This should seem no more controversial than the \ndevelopment of feminist perspectives in criminology which in the early stages fell to female scholars, in \npart to redress the imbalance of men being the primary producers of knowledge. Indeed, Gelsthorpe \nand Morris\u2019 (1988: 105) position, for example,  was that \u201cwomen should be given the time and space to \ndevelop feminist perspectives in their own way, using their own language and not the categories and \nconcepts provided for them by men and in traditional methodologies\u201d.  \n The argument that black criminologists are best placed to understand and explain \u201cblack life\u201d, if \naccepted, has implications for both empirical and theoretical criminology. There is, of course, a danger \nthat such thinking falls into the essentialist trap which assumes a definitive, intrinsic, core \u2018black \nexperience\u2019 which assumes universal oppression, and is something that only minorities can speak about. \nNonetheless, we tend to agree with Jhappan (1996: 30) when she says \u201cour material situations, life \nopportunities, social positionality, and dominant discourses do profoundly mould our experiences and \nunderstanding of the world and our places in it\u201d, and it is this which provides some measure of \nauthenticity to our articulation of minority experiences. It is here that the concepts of strategic \nessentialism (Spivak) or contextual essentialism (Jhappan) may be helpful, in that they allow the forging  \nof a political resistance to racist oppression in criminology and criminal justice, whilst acknowledging the \ncontingent and shifting nature of racial and ethnic identities. \n However, put simply, our position is that all criminologists, regardless of their ethnic identity, can \ncontribute to minority perspectives in British criminology; our notion of minority positions is an \n 10\ninclusive one. This avoids excluding white academics and researchers because they cannot \u2018speak for\u2019 \nminorities - a form of \u2018race credentialism\u2019 according to Jhappan (1996), and also promotes a \nresponsibility to confront social positioning in research, policy and practice. Rather the key requirement \nis a conscious stance and commitment to a number of guiding principles which, in the beginning, \nbearing in mind positionality, may be more easily conceptualised and operationalised by minority \nacademics and researchers. The guiding principles for a minority perspective are subsumed under \napproaches which operate at the empirical and theoretical level, and at the level of practice and policy, \nand it is to these that we now turn.  \n \nEmpirical approaches \n The importance of considering empirical issues relating to \u2018race\u2019 and ethnicity is attested to by a \nhuge literature in this area, particularly in the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, and psychology, and \n there is a focus in much feminist scholarship too. Despite the centrality of \u2018race\u2019 and ethnicity to its \ndomain, such concerns have received relatively little attention in empirical criminology. It is therefore \nincumbent on empirical criminologists adopting a minority perspective to borrow from this body of \nknowledge, so that criminological research does not misrepresent the lived experiences of minorities. \nResearch in this field must embrace a number of principles which are commonly applied in research \nvariously referred to as \u2018anti-discriminatory\u2019, \u2018anti-racist\u2019, or just plain \u2018good\u2019 (Troyna 1995; Gelsthorpe \n1990; Hammersley 1992).   \n First and foremost, is a recognition that the research process is structured by power relations \n 11\nbetween researcher and research participants. This can have the effect of introducing bias in knowledge \nproduction from the front end of developing research questions to ways of answering them, particularly \nwhere these processes are informed by prejudices about the behaviour under study. Feminist standpoint \nepistemologies have been developed in response to this problem, taking as their starting point, that \nknowledge comes from experience. By adopting the standpoint of research participants, feminists have \nsought to produce a \u2018truer\u2019 version of \u2018reality\u2019 by engaging in reflexive struggle intellectually and \npolitically to understand distinctive social experiences (Harding 1987). A reflexive position should \ncritically analyse the complex social locations, identities, and subjectivities of the researcher and those \nparticipating in the research, to see how they bear on the research itself (Cain 1990; Reid and Kelly 1994; \nStanfield 1993; Ramazanoglu 1992), although as Maynard (2002) maintains, this is only ever likely to be \npartially achieved in practice. This provides a challenge to traditional ethnography adopted by the \nChicago School which relied on the empathy of verstehen. According to Valier (forthcoming: ***), this \nempathetic approach can have the effect of silencing minorities by masking differences between them \nand researchers, and not recognising the \u201cforeign within oneself\u201d. Further along this continuum has \nbeen the post-modern rejection of a search for ultimate truths, away from authenticist accounts of \nexperience (particularly through ethnography) to producing  \nsubjective knowledges which are temporally and spatially located but shifting and mediated through \nresearcher interpretation (see for example Alexander 2000).  \n These approaches attempt to transcend the extremes of the Insider and Outsider doctrines \ndescribed by Merton (1972). In this context the former posits that minorities have monopolistic and \nprivileged access to empathic knowledge about the socially shared realities of minority experiences \n 12\nbecause of their continued socialisation. For Rhodes (1994), this approach cannot accommodate \ncomplex and multi-faceted realities which are shifting and likely to vary according to context and topics \nbeing discussed in the research situation In contrast, the Outsider position assumes that knowledge is \nonly accessible to non-members of minority groups who are untainted by prejudice and therefore more \nobjective. As Johnston\u2019s (1974) scathing critique of Merton notes, however, this assumes that it is \npossible to arrive at an absolute truth from objective scientific inquiry, a claim which is roundly rejected \nin recent discussions of how knowledge about social life is produced. However, rather than fully \nrehearsing the detail of this epistemological blind-alley, we begin with Merton\u2019s (1972: 36) appeal to \n\u201cconsider the[ir] distinctive and interactive roles in the process of truth seeking\u201d, but extend this \nproposal to seeking truths or \u2018multiple knowledges\u2019, drawing on the work of white and minority feminist \nscholars (see Harding 1987; Hill Collins 1998).  \n Building on Merton\u2019s call for collaborative work, joining together exponents of the Insider and \nOutsider doctrines offers the most promising path for minority perspectives, although this may not be \nstraightforward in itself (for examples see Daly and Stephens 1995; Mio and Iwamasa 1993). It will be \npredicated on inclusionary practices which avoid exploitation in the research process, although whether \nthis can be achieved is open to question (see for example Alexander 2000; Reay 1996; Dyck, Lynam and \nAnderson 1995). This should not prevent us trying, however, not least because in criminology the status \nof the researcher and the research participants will be particularly significant with the vast majority of \nprincipal investigators on funded research projects being white academics or consultants.  An \ninclusive approach can be partially engendered by recognising that those participating in research should \nbe encouraged to assist in the production of knowledge about their experience by contributing to the \n 13\n                                                \ndesign of the research. This may mean minorities themselves, or informed practitioners or activists \nworking with minorities at the grassroots level. Often such individuals will be the first point of contact in \ngaining access to a group, particularly for qualitative work. Monitoring groups, law centres, minority \nprofessional or support organisations, community groups, religious organisations, are all examples of \nagencies who could be encouraged to assist with the design of research with minorities. Community \nconsultation could include determining the location of the research, how to approach minorities directly, \nthe framing of research questions, how to use culturally appropriate measures, decisions about the \nresearch methods to be used, and the languages in which the research might need to be conducted (see \nTakagi 1981; Mar\u00edn and Mar\u00edn 1991; also Hughes and DuMont 1993 on the use of focus groups).5\n \n It is desirable for minorities also to play a part in the collection of data. Building on Russell\u2019s \n(1992) point, it is likely that \u2018ethnically matched\u2019 data collectors will enhance the rapport and trust \nbetween researcher and participant, and thus increase the willingness to disclose sensitive information in \na qualitative research setting (see for example Bhopal 2001). Recounting incidents of racist harassment \nor discrimination to white researchers, where minorities may fear being accused or perceived to have 'a \nchip on their shoulder' is one example where ethnically matched data collectors may enhance the \ndocumentation of minority experiences (see FitzGerald 1993: 49). Nonetheless, the multi-ethnic and \n \n \n5 The organisation\u2019s own documentary material about minorities\u2019 experience may indeed contribute to the formulation of \n 14\n                                                                                                                                                            \nhybrid nature of \u2018minority identities\u2019 in Britain, alongside the complexities of the multiple identities of \nresearchers and research participants may preclude total ethnic matching and \u201csimplistic symmetry\u201d \n(Mirza 1998: 90). However, researching \u2018an-other\u2019 minority community may still enhance the research \nprocess where shared experiences of racism and minority status exist and are perceived between the \nresearcher and research participant. Egharevba (2001), a researcher of African descent, for example, \nclaimed \u2018insider status\u2019 in her study of South Asian women, based on their common placing in England, \nand despite differences of ethnicity, religion, geography, culture, language, marital status and life \nexperiences. Rhodes (1994), on the other hand, questions assertions that \u2018race\u2019 will dominate other \ndifferences between researcher and participant and alerts us to the potential exploitation of minorities, \nwhere they are required only for data collection duties and not involved in the entire research process \n(see also Phoenix 1998). At a minimum, identification with research participants ethnically, culturally and \nsocially, is a necessary first step to ensuring that the resultant data is experientially grounded, whether \nqualitative or quantitative.  \n \n  The counter-argument would be that an Outsider researcher could act as a detached stranger in \nasking questions about behaviour which a ethnically matched researcher may take for granted and then \nnot interpret as important to the study (Simmel 1921). Similarly, Rhodes\u2019 (1994) account suggests that in \ncertain contexts, \u2018cross-racial\u2019 interviewing may stimulate rather than block communication in the \nresearch encounter. Moreover, \u2018cross-racial\u2019 research is less controversial in studying prejudiced and \n \nresearch questions and understanding.  \n 15\nracist behaviour which may well be concealed in the presence of minority researchers (see also Barn \n1994). It can even be argued that an Insider position may be exploitative as Reay (1996: 65) notes when \nreferring to \u2018the thin dividing line between identification and exploitation\u2019 and the \u2018dangers of proximity\u2019 \nwhich emerged in her research with similarly socially located women. Nonetheless, the legitimacy of the \nresearch will probably be enhanced by using \u2018ethnically matched\u2019 field staff or those from within the \nstudied community. It is becoming increasingly common, for example, for ethnographic research on \ndrugs and gangs in the US to include former drug users, gang members, 'homeboys' and 'homegirls' \nalongside academic researchers (Joe 1993) or even 'well-connected' undergraduate students \n(Mieczkowski 1988). Such individuals must identify ethnically, culturally and socially with the research \nparticipants and be 'street aware' if the research requires it (see for example Dunlap et al. 1990). \n Collaboration should not end when data collection is complete. The interpretation and \nconstruction of minority experiential accounts may be culturally different and even inaccessible to white \nresearchers. For as Landrine, Klonoff and Brown-Collins (1992: 149) observe \u2018the label\/meaning we \nattribute to behavior is a projection of what the behavior would mean if we engaged in it, irrespective of \nwhether \"we\" are black, white, Latino or Asian.\u2019 Similarly, as Gelshorpe (1990: 102) observes in a \ncriminal justice context, \u2018what appears racist or sexist to me (as a white, middle-class academic) might be \ncompletely wide of the mark when compared with the experiences of defendants\u2019. For this reason, it is \nimperative that research participants and similarly located individuals can contribute to the data analysis \nand interpretation stages of the research process (see Myrdal 1944 for an example). Even then what is \nproduced as knowledge is still \u201csimply one version of events\u201d, as Alexander (2000: 47) herself \nacknowledges in her ethnographic account of the experiences of Asian young people and their \u2018gang\u2019. \n 16\nShe describes her position as still one of marginality in some senses, even after nearly five years of study, \nand in spite of her own Asian origins. \n A minority perspective also requires that social research does not exploit those who participate in \nresearch. Part of conducting non-exploitative research is to ensure that the research encounter minimizes \nharm by supporting research participants. This could involve providing contact details for appropriate \nsupport or advice organisations, or even providing payment for participation to acknowledge the likely \ndisproportionate impact of research participation on minorities\u2019 time. Ethical practice by project \nmanagers also requires the protection and support of field staff. Indeed, the British Society of \nCriminology\u2019s Code of Ethics emphasises the need for research managers to protect the physical and \nemotional well-being of research staff in research environments. \u2018Insider\u2019 researchers may face personal \ndoubts and ethical dilemmas, for example, in part from being in the unusual role of having always to be \naccountable to the community being studied (see Zavella 1993; Tuhiwai Smith 1999; Mirza 1998; Wright \n1998). Moreover, where minority researchers do face prejudice and racist behaviour in the field, either \nobserved, discussed, or directed at the researcher, research managers should be prepared to assist with \ndebriefing sessions and by monitoring fieldwork experiences (Phillips and Brown 1997). Assuming that \nthese types of experience are only important for the research purpose: \"just write it down, it'll make \ngood fieldnotes\" is an inadequate response.  \nExploitative practices can be far-reaching. Gordon (1973) has been heavily critical of the way in \nwhich academics have conducted numerous studies in poor and black communities in the US, providing \nthemselves with publications, grants, consultancies, and other prestigious appointments, without \nimproving the life circumstances of those studied; as Spivak (1993: 296) opines, the issue is really about  \n 17\n\u201cgetting your backside in gear and working for your constituency\u201d. This raises important questions \nabout the impact of social research on political and social change more generally which falls outside the \nscope of this paper. However, a minority perspective does make it the responsibility of empirical \ncriminologists to engage in research in a responsible way. Honesty requires an acknowledgement that \nempirical research is the bread-and-butter of Ph.D. students, academics and consultants \u2013 publications, \ngrants, and consultancy work \u2013 the number and quality of which reflect on the way we are perceived by \nthe academy.  \n We have already outlined some guiding principles for undertaking social research with minorities. \nResearchers working within a minority perspective should also be committed to making their research \naccessible by disseminating their research findings directly to research participants in parallel with the \ntraditional approach of publishing in academic journals or books.  This could be through oral \npresentations or short articles in practitioner publications or in the minority press. It should reach those \nwhom participated directly and those on whom it may impact, in terms of media attention, or changes in \npolicy or practice. \nTheoretical approaches \n For Russell (1992) a primary objective in developing a black criminology in the US is to remedy \nthe absence of a subfield within criminology which is sufficiently sophisticated to explain patterns of \noffending by black people who are disproportionately arrested, convicted and incarcerated. She argues \nthat there is a need to move beyond the abundant descriptive analyses of the relationship between race \nand official offending to develop critical theoretical analyses which go beyond tests of existing \ncriminological theories. \n 18\n                                                \n For Russell (1992), a black criminology subfield would encompass theoretical perspectives \nformulated at the micro and macro levels of analysis, and spanning the political spectrum. It is only with \nthe latter point that we would take issue with Russell. In our view, it is hard to envisage any minority \nperspectives in criminology which are conservative in orientation, since such approaches usually locate \nthe causes of crime at the individual or sub\/cultural levels6. While there may be conservative approaches \ntaken by minority criminologists, a minority perspective should not, as Russell suggests, incorporate \nconservative positions which do not explicitly criticise and challenge the empirical  \n \n \n \nbasis for ethnic differences in official involvement in crime, or locate the lived experience of minorities \nwithin structural contexts7.  \n Furthermore, the structural context of life within minority communities cannot be understood \nwithout incorporating an historical perspective. Race and ethnicity, for example, are not ahistorical \n \n \n6  For example, see Herrnstein and Murray (1994); Wolfgang and Ferracuti (1967). \n \n7  Valier\u2019s (forthcoming) critique of the Chicago School of Sociology is insightful here, in highlighting its failure to take \naccount of institutional racism and structural forms of exclusion.  \n \n 19\n                                                \nessences; racist ideas drawn from the philosophies of the European Enlightenment have been translated \ninto modern ideologies of racial supremacy based on these socially constructed categories. Humanity is \npresumed to be divided up into distinct \u2018races\u2019 arranged hierarchically with \u2018whites\u2019 or \u2018Aryans\u2019 \npositioned at the top, above darker-skinned Europeans and Asians, who are, in turn, superior to blacks, \nwho are seen as inherently inferior \u2013 in attractiveness, intelligence, cultural form, and capacity for \nprogress (see Bowling and Phillips 2002). Both explicitly and implicitly these ideas have been normalised \nand institutionalised to justify the enslavement of minorities, the extermination of native peoples, and \nthe acquisition and rule of territories as part of the British empire8. Although the impact of slavery and \ncolonialism cannot be viewed in a unidimensional way, it is apparent that its effects can be seen in the \nlate twentieth century British context. Denial of citizenship and immigration rights, exclusion from \ncertain residential areas, concentration in poor housing, and negative educational and employment \nexperiences have all occurred as state agencies\u2019 practices have operated through a racialised filter \ninformed by notions of inferiority and \u2018undeservedness\u2019 (Smith 1989). The end result of these \ndiscriminatory social practices has been the social, economic and political exclusion of many minority \ngroups, including some white ethnic groups (for a brief discussion see Bowling and Phillips 2002).  \n This historical contextualisation of minority experiences has a direct bearing on our understanding \n \n \n8   It is acknowledged that the relationship between ideologies of superiority and exclusionism and the actual practices of \nethnic exclusion are neither direct nor simple, but it is important to recognise that the two are linked. \n 20\n                                                \nof victimisation, offending and criminal justice in the contemporary period9. Thus, structural theories \nwould predict that people from ethnic minority communities would be disproportionately likely to be \nfound in \u2018criminogenic\u2019 contexts, since deviance is more commonly a viable solution for minority \ncommunities than for the ethnic majority population. Furthermore, deviant behaviour among socially \nand economically marginalised people is much more likely to be labelled as criminal, to result in formal \nsanctions by the state, and to lead individuals to be propelled through the criminal justice process \ntowards imprisonment. Thus, processes of social and economic marginalisation not only have \nconsequences for involvement in deviant behaviour among minority groups, but these are compounded \nby policing and criminal justice processes. Indeed, it is noticeable throughout the work of minority \nresearchers in the US, that the historical experience of minorities under the law and the operation of the \ncriminal justice system, particularly their oppressive and racist impact, clearly informs current accounts \nof both offending and discrimination at various stages of the criminal justice process (see for example \nFrench 1979; Takagi 1981; Mann  1993, 1994; Fishman 1995; Henriques 1995).  \n Linked to the need for minority perspectives to be steeped in an historical understanding of \nminority experience in Britain is the central importance of the explanatory role of racisms in a minority \nanalysis of victimisation, offending, and criminal justice. By racisms we are referring to direct, indirect, \n \n \n9   Williams and Murphy\u2019s (1995) minority account of the evolution of American policing, for example, is insightful for its \nuse of historical material to understand a modern context, and for its reinterpretation of a majority view of the emergence and \ndevelopment of American policing \n 21\n                                                                                                                                                            \ninstitutional and contextual racisms which may on their own or together assist in explaining a variety of \ncriminological phenomena involving minorities. Hood\u2019s (1992) study of sentencing practices in the West \nMidlands, for example, found evidence of direct racial discrimination in Crown Courts; black defendants \nhad a five percent greater probability of being sentenced to immediate custody than white defendants, \nonce all legally relevant factors had been taken into account. Direct discrimination was also identified in \nthe biased decisions made by prison staff in Genders and Player\u2019s (1989) study of work allocations in \nprison, where black prisoners were stereotypically perceived to be lazy, work-shy and incompetent.   \n Probably as important in explaining unequal outcomes is the role of indirect discrimination. This \nrefers to the process whereby the seemingly equal treatment of minority groups has a discriminatory \neffect despite the application of neutral formal criteria. The minimum height requirement for \nappointment as a police officer in some jurisdictions is an example of indirect discrimination. Clearly, \npeople from some minority groups (and women) are less likely to be able to meet the minimum \nrequirement, while height is irrelevant to the job of being a police officer. Perhaps the most significant \nexample of indirect discrimination is the effect of remand status on subsequent sentencing decisions; \nstudies of prosecution and sentencing show that a defendant who has been remanded in custody during \nthe court process is more likely to be sentenced to custody if convicted (Hood 1992). Ethnic minorities \noften fall into the category of people remanded in custody because of their increased chances of being \nhomeless, unemployed or in \u2018disrupted\u2019 families, all of which may be perceived as being linked to failing \nto appear at court. Thus, the seemingly neutral criteria relating to the likelihood of court appearance is \n \n \n 22\nloaded against ethnic minorities because of social inequalities, which are themselves often the result of \nracially discriminatory social practices in housing and employment, for example. \n The Macpherson report (1999: 28) into the death of Stephen Lawrence has also brought to the \ncentre of the political and policy landscape a new language of institutionalised racism, defined as \u201cthe \ncollective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because \nof their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour \nwhich amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist \nstereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people\u201d. In the case of the investigation into the racist \nmurder of Stephen Lawrence, the Inquiry team concluded that officers negatively stereotyped the \nvictims at the scene assuming they were protagonists in a fight, treated the Lawrence family in a \npatronising way following the murder sometimes using inappropriate and offensive language, and were \ncritical of the beliefs of some five investigating officers that the murder was not a racist one. A further \nexample of institutionalised racism lies in the use of stop\/search as a performance indicator. In the \ncontext of a history of strained relations between minority communities and the police, the power is \nused disproportionately and in many instances in a discriminatory fashion against minorities because of \nprejudice and negative stereotyping. The promotion of stop\/search (that is, the more the better) to \ndemonstrate effective job performance in areas of high minority concentration must be seen as further \nevidence of institutional racism in the police service. \n Drawing on the findings from research in the US indicates the need to consider the role of \ncontextual racism and discrimination. As Walker, Spohn and DeLone (1996) note, African Americans \nare subject to the abuse of discretion in the criminal justice process in certain circumstances but not in \n 23\n                                                \nothers. It is evident that prosecutors, judges, and juries with sentencing recommendation powers, even \nin death penalty cases, choose a more lenient outcome for African American offenders when the victim \nis also African American, than in any of the other three victim-offender dyads (Baldus, Woodworth and \nPulaski 1990; Gross and Mauro 1989). This is especially true of cases involving sexual assault, rape and \nhomicide (LaFree 1989; Spohn 1994; see also Hudson 1993).10\n It is also becoming increasingly common in the US to view the differences in arrest and \nimprisonment rates of African Americans, Hispanic Americans and white Americans as the product of \nsocial and structural contexts. Chiricos and Crawford (1995), for example, point to the need to \ndisaggregate imprisonment data and its link to \u2018race\u2019 according to region (South vs. NonSouth), \npercentage of blacks in the population, percentage of blacks residing in urban locations, and area levels \nof unemployment. An attempt to consider such structural contexts was undertaken by Jefferson and \nWalker (1992) in Leeds in their study of arrest rates in areas where there were high and low \nconcentrations of black and Asian residents. Similarly, Hood\u2019s (1992) study in the West Midlands \nhighlights the need for a contextualised analysis of sentencing practices. Hood found that, once all legally \nrelevant variables were controlled for, for every 100 black males sentenced to custody in Birmingham, \n130 were given a custodial sentence in Dudley and even more at Warwick and Stafford Crown Courts. \nThis suggests that the basis for decision-making in sentencing varied in each of the courts. The idea that \ncriminal justice patterns cannot be understood as being determined by \u2018generalised racism\u2019 as Smith \n \n \n10 The extent to which this is true of female offenders, charged with property and violent offences has not been established. \n 24\n(1997) posits, points us towards a recognition that prejudices and their influence on behaviour vary over \ntime, in different places, and in specific contexts. In the case of Hood\u2019s research, for example, there are \nsome obvious differences between Birmingham and the other research sites that an historical analysis \nwould have unveiled. In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, it was in West Midlands satellite towns as \nDudley, Smethwick and Wolverhampton, that the strength of racist sentiment was most strongly \nexpressed by mainstream racist politicians such as Enoch Powell and Peter Griffiths, and where the \nNational Front and other openly racist political parties have had their strongest showing (see Bowling \n1999). The type of quantitative analyses required to uncover these contextual complexities are currently \ndifficult to do in Britain because of the paucity of routinely collected national data. However, expanding \nthe parameters of empirical  \n \nresearch must be a focus for a minority criminological perspective in order to produce a more nuanced \nunderstanding of minority experiences which also draws on qualitative techniques.  \n \nPractice and policy within criminology \nEthical duties \n There is a public role for criminologists whose work is informed by a minority perspective. Firstly, \nthere is a responsibility to be vigilant in critically assessing and monitoring policy developments to assess \nwhether new policies and initiatives have a specific detrimental effect on minorities, either as victims, \n 25\noffenders, or practitioners. It is part of criminologists\u2019 public duty to forewarn policy-makers of the type \nof \u2018malign neglect\u2019 referred to by Tonry (1995) in his book of the same title. In it he sketches the role \nthat the US War on Drugs policy played in the social destruction of minority communities, which Tonry \nargues was completely foreseeable by politicians and policy makers (see also Miller 1996). \n Secondly, the public service responsibility should also extend to what Russell (1998: 94) refers to \nas \u201can affirmative duty on researchers today to take responsibility for the research claims put in the \npublic domain\u201d. She contends that researchers are duty-bound to put forward clarifications or rebuttals \nwhere inaccurate or false representations are made, especially where they are claimed to be based on \nsocial science research. In particular, Russell argues for a research community response to the misuse of \nsocial science research concerning the relationship between race, ethnicity and crime. A case in point \nwould be a response to the FitzGerald (1999:22) study of stop\/search patterns in the Metropolitan \nPolice to underline that a statistical \u201clink between the fall in searches and the rise in street crime\u201d was not \nof a causal nature. Russell suggests that such clarifications could include an official statement from \nprofessional associations (such as the American Society of Criminology), a response from a group of \nexperts in the field, and a public response through the media.   \n Thirdly, there is also an ethical imperative to criticise existing work which is based on ill-\nconsidered stereotypes and is guilty of cultural pathologising. Indeed, it is incumbent on criminologists \noperating within a minority perspective to ensure proportionate interest in minority experience. The \noverrepresentation of some minorities as offenders in official statistics does not negate the fact that the \nvast majority of offences that are detected are committed by white offenders. That the proportion of \nwhite male and female British nationals in prison in 1999 was 86 and 85 per cent respectively should not \n 26\nbe overlooked in academic and public debates about offending (Home Office 2000). A critical \nunderstanding of the hegemonic nature of white ethnicity and its relationship to victimisation and \noffending is required. \nA research agenda \n Criminologists working within a minority perspective can contribute to theory, research, practice \nand policy by opening up a new research agenda which focuses on diverse minority groups in British \nsociety. Research topics such as anti-semitic violence and how it is policed, the victimisation, offending \nbehaviour, and social control of refugees and asylum-seekers, Irish, Turkish, Chinese and travelling \ncommunities are all necessary to broaden our criminological knowledge. Indeed, as Pearson (1983) has \nshown, historically, various white ethnic groups have been perceived as problematic visiting specific \nkinds of crimes on the indigenous English and requiring special measures of control (see Bowling and \nPhillips 2002 for a brief review). However, we are not proposing a project which serves simply to expose \nthe dynamics of \u2018Other\u2019 cultures, since this itself has the potential to pathologise, exoticise, or even to \nopen them up to new forms of surveillance and scrutiny (see Hutnyk 1996).  The call is instead for an \nunderstanding of the lived experiences of minorities other than those traditionally studied in \ncriminology, and in a way which recognises the dynamic nature of ethnic identities which are bound up \nwith other sources of identity such as gender, age, class, religion and sexuality. The role of white ethnic \nidentities in understanding racist violence, football and alcohol-related violence should be a key part of \nthis project too (Back, Crabbe, and Solomos 1999). \n A balanced programme of research of both comparative and single-group case studies is needed to \n 27\nensure that racial categories are not reified beyond their social construction (Stanfield 1993). Thus, for \nexample, a qualitative study of the offenders\u2019 perspective in relation to robbery (which has the starkest \ndifference in officially recorded rates of offending) could be a comparative study of white and minority \noffenders convicted of robbery offences. This could chart trajectories into offending, motivation for \ntype of crime, techniques for committing crime, reactions to criminalisation and so on. A \ncomplementary approach would be to include an analysis of official crime reports and interviews in \ncustody to examine how the police come to charge robbery offenders. It is worth exploring empirically, \nfor example, whether there is a tendency for the police to overcharge minorities with robbery rather than \nwith less serious and non-violent offences (see Blom-Cooper and Drabble 1992). Given the negative \nstereotyping of young black men as threatening and violent, which undoubtedly contributes to their \nincreased likelihood of being excluded from school, and to have their infractions in prison treated more \nharshly than their white and Asian counterparts (see for example Ofsted 2001 and Genders and Player \n1989), this would seem to be a fruitful avenue for research. Here we are also reminded of Becker\u2019s \n(1967:242) question and its relevance for minorities: \u201c[M]ost research on youth, after all, is clearly \ndesigned to find out why youth are so troublesome for adults, rather than asking the equally interesting \nsociological question: Why do adults make so much trouble for youth ?\u201d \n Both minority and feminist perspectives share a desire to make the interest group visible, but the \nfocus of this visibility is somewhat different. Whereas feminist criminologists have sought to expose the \nneglect of women as offenders and victims and to understand their treatment in the criminal justice \nsystem, minority perspectives will seek to redress a criminological imbalance. Empirical criminology has \nbeen overly concerned with minorities, particularly black minorities, as offenders. Less attention, until \n 28\n                                                \nrecently, has centred on minorities as victims of racist crimes (see Bowling 1999 for a review). Clearly \nthere is further scope for extending analyses of victimisation to minority experiences of policing and \ncustody where minorities are victimised by agents of the criminal justice system. There is little recent \nempirical research, for example, which contextualises the experience of minority prisoners from the \nperspective of those who experience discrimination, harassment and victimisation by prison  \n \n \nofficers. Similarly, where are the criminological studies of minority prison officers, probation officers, \nlawyers or policy-makers?11\n A further proposal for empirical criminology informed by a minority position is to extend the \nboundaries of existing research. Most will be aware of the multitude of methodological difficulties that \nbedevil attempts to assess the role of direct or indirect racial discrimination in criminal justice processing, \n \n \n11  It has often been left to the media to bring to public attention the racism faced by minority staff in the criminal \njustice field. For example: \u2018An Asian lawyer who claimed that a culture of racism prevented her from being promoted \nwithin the Crown Prosecution Service was awarded \u00a330,000 damages yesterday\u2019, The Daily Telegraph, 2 February 2000; \n\u2018The head of the prison service is to apologise to a black worker who was humiliated and abused when he returned to \nwork after winning damages for racial discrimination\u2019 (The Times, 20 April 2000); \u2018North Wales Probation Committee \nmust pay \u00a33,500 after being found guilty of racial discrimination against the area\u2019s only black probation officer\u2019, Daily \nPost, 23 March 1996. \n \n 29\nmaking it a futile exercise according to some criminologists (Reiner 1993; FitzGerald 1993; see also \nHoldaway 1997).  In part because of a growing interest in minority experiences of crime and criminal \njustice, but also because of Section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, it is likely that research will \ncontinue to expand in this area. An innovative methodology for rigorously examining the decision-\nmaking of criminal justice agents, particularly those who have been traditionally less accessible to \nresearchers and less open to public scrutiny, such as judges, will be required.  \n It is hoped that challenges to the common approach of using regression analyses to statistically \nmodel the complex decision-making of judges (Hood 1992), crown prosecutors and police officers \n(Mhlanga 1997; Phillips and Brown 1998) to find a direct \u2018race\u2019 effect will be accepted and taken \nforward. The US approach could assist here. Frazier and Bishop (1995), for example, used their \nquantitative data - which showed that the \u2018race\u2019 of offender had an independent effect in formal juvenile \njustice system processing - to explore whether the results were consistent with officials' experiences in \nthe juvenile justice system. The researchers gave a two-paragraph description of the quantitative findings \nto judges, prosecutors, public defenders, and intake supervisors, and asked them whether the findings \nwere consistent with their experiences. This was an attempt to explore the processes whereby \u2018race\u2019 and \nracism are socially constructed in routine decision-making (cf. Holdaway 1997). Similarly, Gelsthorpe \n(1993) has emphasised the importance of using qualitative data to examine the organizational context for \nreport-writing practices, to flesh out the superficial data which comes from statistical analyses of \n 30\n                                                \nethnically monitored outcomes. These types of studies have shed light on the way in which family \nassessments determining a lack of 'good parenting' (as assessed against white middle-class norms) impact \ndisproportionately  on minorities and are an example of indirect racial discrimination12.  \n \nMinority criminologists \n We touched on the question of who should contribute to a minority perspective in criminology \nearlier and do not intend to repeat the discussion here, except to consider the professional dangers of \npartiality (or bias) when minority criminologists study minorities\u2019 experience of victimisation, offending \nand criminal justice. Feminists and anti-racist researchers in other disciplines have been accused of \nlacking objectivity (see Gelsthorpe and Morris 1988; Troyna 1995; Russell 1992), but as Becker \n(1967:245) observed, it is inevitable that research is \u2018contaminated\u2019 by personal and political sympathies, \n\u201cthere is no position from which sociological research can be done that is not biased in one or another \nway\u201d. It is, in our view, possible and desirable to \u2018balance commitment with scholarship\u2019 (see \nWaddington 2000). \n Associated with claims of damaging subjectivity is the concern with marginalisation whereby \n \n \n12  See also Frazier and Bishop (1995) who reported that juvenile justice officials used more severe sanctions where they \nperceived that minority families were incapable of providing good parental supervision. Where parents were expected to be \ninterviewed by juvenile justice personnel, those without telephones, cars or with inflexible jobs were less accessible, and were \nimplicitly deemed to be less capable of providing good parental supervision. \n 31\nminority academics\/researchers are warned of the danger of topic limitation by focusing exclusively on \n'race issues\u2019. Yet as Blaikie (2000) notes, social research is often carried out to pursue personal interests \nor commitments, to satisfy curiosity or to solve a personal problem. Moreover, regardless of whether the \nracialised status of minority criminologists does or does not influence their research interests, this should \nnot take away from any significant contributions to the body of criminological knowledge that minority \ncriminologists make, in whatever area. Finally, as the section on empirical approaches and the next \nsection make clear, it is imperative that minority scholars undertake work in this area.  \n \n The establishment of the Racism, Ethnicity and Criminology Round Table website and discussion forum \nhas been spurred on by the need to discuss these types of issues in a supportive environment13. Arising \nfrom a round table discussion held at the 1997 British Criminology Conference, its subscribers include \nminority and white researchers, academics and practitioners in the criminology community. Its purpose \nis to inform public opinion, and to aid practitioners and policy-makers in their work surrounding issues \nof racism, ethnicity and criminology. It has been used to discuss new work, emerging ideas, advertise \nconferences, and to announce employment opportunities in the field (see \nhttp:\/\/www.surrey.ac.uk\/~scp1az). \n                                                 \n \n13  Minority-established support organisations have also been set up in the police service, legal field, probation and prison \nservices, and more recently the Home Office (see Bowling and Phillips 2002). \n 32\nLooking within the discipline \n If a minority perspective is to confront practices within the discipline of criminology itself this \nleads to the question \u2018is British criminology institutionally racist?\u2019 must be faced. The Home Secretary \nand Minister of State for Prisons publicly acknowledge institutional racism in the Home Office and \nPrison Service, but there appears to be little consideration of such issues within academia more \ngenerally14. Borrowing from the definition provided by the Lawrence Inquiry, we have to ask whether \nBritish criminology fails to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their \ncolour, culture or ethnic origin through discrimination, prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist \nstereotyping? \n A starting point to answering this question would be to examine whether the lower salary, \nseniority and poorer tenure position found for minorities by the Association of University Teachers \n(2000) using Higher Education Statistics Agency data for 1998\/1999 is mirrored in criminology\/criminal \njustice. What are the levels of representation and seniority for minority and white criminology\/criminal \njustice academics and researchers, as well as those serving on the editorial boards of criminological \njournals, personnel employed within funding agencies such as the Home Office, and those tasked with \nthe governance of the British Society of Criminology? Such basic information needs to be supplemented \nby a more qualitative assessment of minority experiences in the discipline, including the extent of \n 33\n                                                                                                                                                            \nperceived prejudice and discrimination in the academic setting, policy-making environment or in \nresearch settings. Is there evidence of prejudice, direct, indirect, institutional or contextual discrimination \nin student recruitment, in teaching and learning, on work placements, for contract research jobs or other \npoints of access to the field? Are minorities included in the informal networks and patronage that \ntypically feature in a successful academic career (see Heward, Taylor and Vickers 1997)? Are \ndiscriminatory practices evident in the centres of criminology and criminal justice in universities and the \nHome Office, in terms of career development and work experience? \n While there are obvious limitations to comparing the US and the UK experience, such as the \nrelative size of minority populations, research in this area could usefully draw on what is known about \nthe experience of minority criminologists in the USA. They have painted a largely pessimistic picture of \nthe excluded status of minorities in the criminology\/criminal justice field. Young and Sulton (1996), for \nexample, have described the invisibility of minorities in influential positions within American \ncriminology. They feel excluded from reviews of theory, providing expert opinions to the media, as \nrecipients of major grant awards, on policy groups or task forces, on policy-making boards of \ncriminology organizations, and on editorial boards of journals. They note that only two of 157 members \nof editorial boards of the ten leading refereed journals in criminology\/criminal justice were African \nAmerican. Taylor Greene and Gabbidon (2000) have also criticised mainstream criminological \ndiscourses for ignoring the work of pioneering and contemporary African American scholars such as Du \nBois and Hawkins. \n \n14 A new study on institutional racism in universities is being conducted by the University of Leeds Centre for Ethnicity and \n 34\n                                                                                                                                                            \n Some positive solutions have been sought in the field, however, including three American Society \nof Criminology Fellowships for ethnic minorities, the National Institute of Justice W.E.B. DuBois \nFellowship Program, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation\/Vera Institute of Justice Postdoctoral \nFellowship on Race, Crime and Justice. In 1995 the American Society of Criminology established a \nDivision of People of Color and Crime to facilitate research and advance multiple perspectives about \npeople of colour and crime and criminal justice, to stimulate teaching in the field, to raise awareness \nwithin the American Society of Criminology, as well as serving as a resource network for those in the \nfield, alongside internet-based discussion groups. There has also been the devotion of journal issues to \nminority scholars or work on \u2018race\u2019 and ethnicity. Professional workshops for minorities are also \nincluded at conferences in the US. A minority perspective could carefully consider whether any of these \noptions are appropriate for the UK context. Indeed, following the US lead, the  \nArlene Mundle Postgraduate Scholarship has been established by the British Society of Criminology, \nwith applications encouraged from minority students.  \n Just as one response to the Macpherson Inquiry has been a widespread consensus that more \nminorities need to be recruited into criminal justice services as employees, claims can be made for \nimproving the representation of minorities within criminology and criminal justice. Those working in \nacademic or administrative criminology should reflect the local communities of which they form a part. \nAs Russell (1992) suggests, minority lecturers may also encourage minority students into the field, an \nessential development for the future of the discipline. The role of minority lecturers, according to \n \nRacism Studies (http:\/\/www.leeds.ac.uk\/CERS\/research.htm). \n 35\nRussell, may also be to diversify the criminology curriculum. Indeed, the way in which \u2018race\u2019, ethnicity \nand racism are covered in criminology must also be examined. The potential for conflict in confronting \nsuch academic practices is highlighted by Erasmus (2000) in discussing tensions in the South African \nacademy as minorities challenge liberal white academics\u2019 positions on interpreting the stories of \nminorities, racism, and white dominance post-apartheid.  \n \nConclusion \n The current political climate is more receptive to seeing crime and criminal justice from a minority \nperspective than it has ever been. The government acceptance of the Lawrence Inquiry\u2019s finding of \ninstitutional racism in the Metropolitan Police Service, the acknowledgement that it is present in many \nsocial institutions, including the Home Office and the Prison Service, and the promotion of minority \nprofessional associations in the criminal justice professions (the National Black Police Association, \nSociety of Black Lawyers, National Association of Asian Probation Staff, Home Office Network to \nname but a few) are evidence of this changed environment. The arguments presented in this paper have \nexplored some of the guiding principles for minority perspectives in criminology. It is very possible that \nthey will face the same marginalised status as feminist perspectives have in criminology (Gelsthorpe and \nMorris 1988). At the very least, however, we hope that its impact will be felt at the front-line, so to \nspeak; that is, in the interaction between researcher and researched.   \n 36\nReferences \n \nAlexander, C.
