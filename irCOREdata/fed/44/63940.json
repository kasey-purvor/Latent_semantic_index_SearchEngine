A connection between \nphysiology, behavior, and cognition was recently demonstrated in strains of rainbow trout \n(Oncorhynchus mykiss) selected for consistently high or low cortisol responses to stress. Compared to \nhigh-responsive (HR) fish the low-responsive (LR) strain display better retention of a conditioned \nresponse, and tend to show proactive behavior such as enhanced aggression, social dominance, and rapid \nresumption of feed intake in new environments. Marked differences between HR and LR trout in brain \nmonoamine neurochemistry have also been reported. In line with these studies, experiments with the \nlizard Anolis carolinensis reveal connections between monoaminergic activity in limbic structures, \nproactive behavior in novel environments, and the establishment of social status via agonistic behavior. \nTogether these observations suggest that within-species diversity of behavioral and cognitive correlates \nof stress responsiveness is maintained by natural selection over a wide range of animal groups. This \ndiversity may underlie several seemingly different phenomena such as stress coping style, behavioral \nsyndromes, and animal personalities.   \n \n \n1. Introduction \n1. Individuality of the stress response - a widespread phenomenon  \nFew terms are as popular and frequently used in biology, medicine and psychology as \"stress\". The very \ndefinition of \"stress\" as a biological term, however, has a long history of controversies. Many of these \ncontroversies stem from the fact that what is stressful to one person, or animal, is not always stressful for \nother members of the same species. It is now recognized that stress coping is of fundamental importance \nto fitness and quality of life in a number of species (Cavigelli and McClintock, 2003; Janczak et al., \n2003; Korte et al., 2005), including humans (e.g. Susman et al., 1999). In fact, understanding individual \ndifferences in coping ability has become a paramount task in biological psychiatry and stress research \n(see e.g. Bartolomucci et al., 2005; Korte et al., 2005). \n Behavioral responses to stress have been described with a variety of terminologies (see e.g. \nKoolhaas et al., 1999; Wingfield, 2003). A distinction is often made between proactive (active coping, or \n\u2018fight-flight\u2019) and reactive (passive coping, or \u2018conservation-withdrawal\u2019) responses. During stress or \nduring exposure to glucocorticoid hormones a transition from behavioral activation to inhibition is \ntypically seen with increasing duration or severity of the challenge (Haller et al., 1998; \u00d8verli et al., \n2002a; Wingfield, 2003). The threshold at which the shift from an active to a passive behavioral response \noccurs is subject to great individual variation, and so is the period of recovery needed to restore normal \nbehavior. It has also been firmly established that individual differences in behavior are associated with \ndifferences in the physiological stress response. Koolhaas et al. (1999) promoted the term stress coping \nstyle to describe this phenomenon. These authors defined coping style as \"a coherent set of behavioral \nand physiological stress responses, which is consistent over time and which is characteristic to a certain \ngroup of individuals\".   \n Koolhaas et al. (1999) also reviewed the evidence that two opposing stress coping styles \n(proactive and reactive) can be identified in mammals. A proactive stress coping style is characterized by \na high level of active avoidance, aggression, and other actions indicating active attempts to counteract the \nstressful stimulus. Reactive coping, on the other hand, involves immobility and low levels of aggression. \nPhysiologically, the proactive strategy is associated with low hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis \nresponsiveness, but high sympathetic reactivity, while the opposite is true for reactive coping. A genetic \nbasis for the expression of behavioral and physiological components of individual coping styles has \nrepeatedly been demonstrated (e.g. Driscoll et al., 1998; Lepage et al., 2000; Ellenbroek and Cools, 2002; \nde Boer et al, 2003; Veenema et al., 2003). Koolhaas et al. (1999), however, point out that genetic and \nepigenetic factors combine to generate a relatively stable trait characteristic that confers differential \nadaptation to environmental conditions such as population density, social stability and food availability. \nPersistence of a given set of characteristics could thus depend on fluctuations in environmental factors \n(Dingemanse et al., 2004; H\u00f6jesj\u00f6 et al., 2004) as well as frequency dependent selection.  \n Compared to the literature in mammals, relatively little information is available on the occurrence \nof different individual stress-coping styles in other animal groups. Among teleost fish, consistent \nbehavioral patterns that may reflect alternative coping styles have been observed in cichlids, \nsticklebacks, and salmonids (Huntingford, 1976; Francis, 1990; Van Raaij et al., 1996; Budaev et al., \n1999; Bell and Stamps, 2004; Brelin et al., 2005; Schjolden et al., 2005a). Recent evidence suggests that \ndivergent hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis reactivity is associated with consistent differences \nin behavior in rainbow trout (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001a; \u00d8verli et al, 2002b, 2005). The HPI-axis is \nthe teleost equivalent of the mammalian hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Mommsen et al., \n1999), and in rainbow trout the magnitude of the cortisol response to stress is an individual trait which is \nstable over time, with a moderate to high degree of heritability (Pottinger and Carrick, 1999). Lines of \nrainbow trout selected for high (HR) and low (LR) post-stress cortisol levels have been established by \nT.G. Pottinger at the UK Natural Environment Research Council, Center for Ecology and Hydrology. LR \nfish show a strong tendency to become socially dominant (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001a), a more rapid \nrecovery of feeding after transfer to a novel environment (\u00d8verli et al., 2002b), and a reduced locomotor \nresponse (interpreted as reduced anxiety, not reduced aggression, because no aggression was seen) in a \nterritorial intrusion test (\u00d8verli et al., 2002b). Furthermore, Moreira et al. (2004) recently demonstrated \nstrain differences in the ability to form or recall memories of a stressful event: after a similar number of \ntraining trials, the consequent rate of extinction of a conditioned response was more rapid in the HR fish. \n In summary, the HR-LR lines appear to demonstrate that a heritable association between \nincreased cortisol production, anxiety-like behavior, and altered cognitive function is present in a \ncomparative vertebrate model system. In this review we also recount studies indicating the existence of \nsimilar trait associations both in another poikilotherm species, the lizard Anolis carolinensis (Summers et \nal., 2005a,b; Korzan et al., 2006a,b), as well as in non-selected aquaculture populations of fish (\u00d8verli et \nal, 2004a, 2006; Brelin et al., 2005). Comparisons with studies on mammals are also made, which \ntogether suggest that some trait associations are consistent throughout the vertebrate sub-phylum. Finally, \nwe give a brief overview of some possible underlying physiological mechanisms.   \n \n2. The HR-LR trout model \n2.1. Selection program \nThe HR and LR rainbow trout lines were initiated in 1996 by repeated stress testing (3h confinement in \n50 L water in groups of 6-7 individuals once monthly) of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tagged 2-\nyear-old rainbow trout (for details see Pottinger and Carrick, 1999). Mean post-stress plasma titers of the \nteleost corticosteroid hormone cortisol across five episodes of confinement were then calculated for each \nfish, and individuals were ranked accordingly. Confinement stress testing of the 1st generation offspring \n(F1), consisting of 15 HR and 14 LR families each resulting from a unique male-female crossing, were \ncarried out on five different occasions between September 1997 and September 1998, and on five \noccasions in 1999. A highly significant regression of mid-parent cortisol response on progeny response \nwas seen (estimated r2 [h2] value = 0.41), and the six LR families with the lowest mean cortisol response \nand the six HR families with the highest mean cortisol response were identified and used in further \nbreeding (Pottinger and Carrick, 1999). The F2 generation consisted of 11 HR, 11 LR and 3 unselected \nfamilies. At present, studies are carried out on the F4 and F5 generations of fish. \n \n2.2. Behavior of HR and LR trout  \nAdult female F1 generation HR and LR fish was used in experiments investigating the effect of selection \nfor stress responsiveness on behavior and brain monoaminergic activity (\u00d8verli et al., 2001, 2002b). In \nthis experiment, HR and LR trout were transferred from communal holding tanks to isolation in \nobservation tanks. After 6 days in isolation, locomotor activity was quantified while observing each fish \nfirst in an undisturbed condition and thereafter during a territorial intruder test. In this test, both HR and \nLR rainbow trout increased their activity level when the intruder was present (intruders are smaller, \npreviously unfamiliar individuals of the same species that are suddenly introduced in the holding unit of \na territorial fish, c.f. H\u00f6glund et al., [2001]). HR trout displayed higher locomotor activity than LR trout \nin the presence of an intruder, but not while they were undisturbed. Furthermore, approximately 40 % of \nthe LR fish were feeding during the one week experimental period experiment, while no HR fish \ningested any food during this time. Hence, low cortisol production during stress coincided with both a \nlow locomotor response to stress and more rapid reversal of stress-induced anorexia (\u00d8verli et al., \n2002b).  \n Behavioral differences between the HR-LR trout lines were also investigated by Pottinger and \nCarrick (2001a), who observed the outcome of fights for social dominance between juvenile fish from \nthe F2 generation in a series of dyadic encounters. Juvenile rainbow trout, in common with other \npredominantly stream-resident salmonids (Keenleyside and Yamamoto, 1962; Taylor, 1990; Hutchison \nand Iwata, 1997), are intensely territorial animals. When introduced simultaneously into an arena they \nwill engage in agonistic activity that results in the establishment distinct dominance hierarchies (J\u00f6nsson \net al., 1998; Winberg and Lepage, 1998; \u00d8verli et al., 1999, 2004b). Using position of the fish within the \ntank, locomotor activity, agonistic behavior, feeding, and plasma cortisol as criteria of social dominance, \nPottinger and Carrick (2001a) reported that LR fish became dominant in a majority (43 out of 46) of HR-\nLR pairings. The mechanistic basis for the apparent co-selection of competitive ability and stress \nresponsiveness is yet undetermined. Clearly, both direct effects of cortisol (DiBattista et al., 2005) and \nthe involvement of central signaling substances such as corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and \nbrain monoamine neurotransmitters (Winberg and Nilsson, 1992, 1993) require further investigation. \n In summary, some of the features of the LR trout line suggest that they represent selection for a \npro-active stress coping style, as defined by Koolhaas et al. (1999). It should, however, also be pointed \nout that the behavior of the HR-LR lines of fish is highly context dependent, and the fishes are influenced \nby factors such as novel environments and group size (Schjolden et al., 2005b, 2006).  It can therefore \nnot yet be ascertained to what degree the behavioral and endocrine profiles of HR and LR rainbow trout \ncorrespond to the trait associations identified in other animal groups (Koolhaas et al., 1999; Steimer and \nDriscoll, 2003; Bolhuis et al., 2004, 2005; Groothuis and Carere, 2005) and humans (Bohnen et al., 1991; \nSgoifo et al., 2003; Salvador, 2005).  \n  \n2.3. Conditioned responses and brain monoaminergic activity in HR and LR trout \nMoreira et al. (2004) performed an experiment where groups of HR and LR fish were exposed to a paired \nconditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US). After exposure to 18 CS\u2013US pairings, at \nleast 70% of the individuals of both lines acquired a conditioned response upon presentation of the CS \nonly. Post-conditioning, the fish were tested by presentation of the CS at weekly intervals with no further \nreinforcement, and the extinction of the conditioned response in the two lines was compared. The \nfrequency of individuals who retained the conditioned response was greater among the LR than HR fish \nat 14, 21 and 28 days after the last CS-US pairing took place. \n To our knowledge, the study by Moreira et al. (2004) is the first to indicate a genetic basis for an \nassociation between cognitive, neuroendocrine, and behavioral traits in teleost fish. In mammals, it has \nrepeatedly been shown that signal systems conveying the effects of stress on physiological processes are \nalso involved in behavior and cognitive ability. For example, catecholamines released in the first phase \nof the stress response are known to promote consolidation and\/or storage of novel information (McGaugh \nand Roozendaal, 2002). The influence of HPA-axis activation on cognition in mammals has been \nextensively explored (for reviews see e.g. Roozendaal, 2002; Wolf, 2003). The brain monoamine \nneurotransmitters serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) have \nalso been shown to modulate learning and memory in a number of different training tasks and contexts \n(e.g. Meneses, 1998; Liang et al., 2001; Dreher et al., 2002). For instance, there appears to be a link \nbetween dopaminergic cortical innervation and the development of cognitive capacities (Nieoullon et al., \n2003), and the magnitude of dopamine release predicts accuracy of memory on a delayed response task \n(Phillips et al., 2004).  \n \u00d8verli et al. (2001) described differences in brain monoaminergic function between HR and LR \nrainbow trout. In this study only a limited number of fish could be sacrificed for analysis of brain \nneurochemistry (and only post spawning females were available), hence the results may not give a \ncomplete picture of monoamine metabolism in these strains of fish. However, the pattern of stress \ninduced elevation of brain stem and optic tectum concentrations of 5-HT, NE, DA, and their metabolites, \nsuggested that both synthesis and metabolism of these transmitters were elevated after stress to a larger \ndegree in HR than in LR trout. A divergent pattern was seen in the hypothalamus, where LR fish \ndisplayed elevated levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA, a serotonin metabolite) and 3-\nmethoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG, an unsulphated norepinephrine metabolite in salmonids). In \nthe telencephalon, LR fish had higher baseline 5-HIAA\/5-HT ratios, while there were no significant \ndifferences between stressed HR and LR fish. Like in mammals, brain monoamine neurotransmitters are \ncentrally involved in the control of behavioral and endocrine stress responses in teleost fish (Winberg \nand Nilsson, 1993; Winberg et al., 1997, 2001; \u00d8verli et al., 1998, 1999; H\u00f6glund et al., 2001, 2002a,b; \nClements et al., 2003; Larson et al., 2003; Perreault et al., 2003; Lepage et al., 2005), but the possible \nrole of these signal substances in memory function has not been extensively studied in fish.  \n \n3. Observations on hatchery strains of rainbow trout \n3.1. Feeding behaviour as an indicator of stress coping style \nIn previous experiments with HR and LR trout (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001a; \u00d8verli et al., 2002b), the \nmost striking differences in behavior between the lines were seen in the locomotor response to territorial \nintrusion (higher in HR), the tendency to regain feed intake after stress (more rapid in LR), and the \nability to gain social dominance in pairs (higher in LR). Later experiments addressed whether the same \ntrait associations are present also in non-selected hatchery populations of rainbow trout (\u00d8verli et al., \n2004a, 2006). It was found that the duration of appetite inhibition after stress predicted social dominance \nwith near 100% certainty, with rapid reversal of stress-induced anorexia being characteristic of \nindividuals likely to become dominant in later contests (\u00d8verli et al., 2004a). The tendency to become \ndominant did not depend on a size advantage in animals that rapidly resumed feeding. In fact, even if \nthey took food on more occasions, these individuals displayed significantly lower growth rates during the \nexperimental period (\u00d8verli et al., 2004a). This observation is in line with previous reports that high \nmetabolic rates predict social dominance in salmonid fishes (Metcalfe et al., 1995; McCarthy, 2001). \n The general approach in our studies with hatchery populations of rainbow trout has been to \nremove individuals from a large homogenous population, and then study the behavior and physiology of \nthese fish in isolation (\u00d8verli et al., 1999, 2004ab, 2006). The weeklong isolation period, and the fact that \nall fish come from the median size interval in a larger population, is intended to minimize the effect of \nprevious social interactions. After the acclimation period, fish are subjected to various treatments such as \ntests of stress responsiveness, or social interaction in pairs. This experimental approach is summarized in \nfigure 1. A similar approach is used in studies with the lizard Anolis carolinensis (described in chapter \n4), with the main difference being that these animals are caught in the wild before being transferred to \nthe laboratory. \nIn some experiments (\u00d8verli et al., 2006; S\u00f8rensen, 2006), feeding behavior was described \naccurately by assigning a score to each fish on each feeding occasion (once daily during one week). \nFeeding behavior was rated according to a 4-step scale following the criteria listed in table I, and all \npoints obtained during one week were later summed for each individual. All fish would advance through \nthe stages listed in table I with varying speed of progress. The resulting measure would depend on how \nrapidly fish resumed normal feeding behavior, with high points indicative of quick acclimation to the \nnew environment. Total feeding score was found to predict several other behavioral and physiological \nmeasures. The relationship between feeding score and plasma cortisol levels in undisturbed socially \nisolated fish is graphed in figure 2 (\u00d8. \u00d8verli, C. S\u00f8rensen, and G.E. Nilsson, unpublished results). Other \nclear patterns were that fish that obtained a high total feeding score showed lower brain stem 5-HIAA \nconcentrations, high aggression, and less locomotion during acute confinement stress, and (table II, \nsummary of unpublished data and data from \u00d8verli et al., 2006).  \n  \n3.2. Boldness, hunger, or learning? \nObviously, it is not straightforward to adjudge whether fish that start to eat quickly are bolder (i.e., the \nanxiogenic effect of novelty and transport wear off faster) or simply hungrier in the feeding test (i.e., the \nanorectic effect of stress wear off faster). Furthermore, boldness and motivation to feed are tightly linked \nthrough common neuroendocrine signaling systems (see e.g. Bernier and Peter, 2001; Carr, 2002). It \nshould, however, be kept in mind that the rainbow trout used in our studies are poikilotherm animals kept \nin relatively cold water (5-15\u00b0C). These fish can live for long periods without food, if necessary. Hence, \nin most situations where active feeding behavior would imply both benefits and potential costs, salmonid \nfish are more likely to decline feeding than would be expected from mammalian studies. In fact, anyone \nwho has ever fished for salmonids using prey imitations as lures can subscribe to how easy it is to disturb \nthese fish so that they refuse to open their mouth. In a study by \u00d8verli et al (1998) it took one week to \nrestore normal feeding behaviour in previously subordinate fish after they had been removed from their \ndominant partner. At this point the effect of social position on brain serotonin metabolism had also been \nreversed (\u00d8verli et al., 1998). Hence, restoration of feeding after stress is likely to reflect downregulation \nof the physiological stress response, and feeding score would seem to be a very precise indicator of stress \ncoping style in salmonid fish. \nSeveral other factors, such as differences in metabolic rate, are of course likely to influence \nfeeding behavior. A fish with a relatively high metabolic rate will consume energy resources more \nrapidly, and physiological hunger signals will take effect. Consider, for instance, the graph in figure 2: \nFishes with higher levels of the catabolic hormone cortisol generally have low feeding scores, but scores \nappear to rise again at the high end of the cortisol range. Notably, very few individuals contributed to the \nhigh-cortisol part of the curve. Nevertheless, the curvilinear approach (second order polynomial with y = \n0.061x2 - 2.1341x + 19.533) yielded a much better fit (r2=0.78) than a linear trend line (r2=0.41), and a \nruns test for deviation from linearity came out marginally significant (p=0.047). Hence, with respect to \nthe control of feed intake in rainbow trout, a likely conclusion is that cognitive and emotional aspects of \nHPI-axis activation can outweigh metabolic effects for extended periods of time. This notion may, \nhowever, only be valid up to a certain level of cortisol exposure.  \nAs pointed out by Sneddon (2003), an apparent difference in boldness could also come from a \ndifference in learning (i.e. some fish are faster to learn that feeding in the new environment was not \nassociated with danger or other negative experience). Again, the association between stress \nresponsiveness and cognitive abilities recently demonstrated by Moreira et al. (2004) suggests that \nlearning and\/or memory retention is important for the expression of alternative stress coping styles.  \n \n4. The Anolis carolinensis model \n4.1 General description of the Anolis behavior \nWild-caught male Anolis carolinensis lizards have been recruited for many studies investigating \nphysiological responses associated with the establishment of social rank (Summers, 2002; Summers and \nGreenberg 1994; Summers et al., 1998, 2005a,b; Korzan et al. 2002, 2004, 2006a,b; H\u00f6glund et al., \n2005). The study of stress associated with agonistic behavior in A. carolinensis is facilitated by their \neyespots. Eyespots are specialized patches of skin located postorbitally to each eye (Hadley and \nGoldman, 1969; Vaughan and Greenberg, 1987), which darken when the animal is agitated or aggressive. \nThis response has been reported to depend on both sympathetic activation and brain monoaminergic \nneurotransmission (Summers and Greenberg, 1994; Larsson and Summers, 2001; H\u00f6glund et al., 2005).  \nThese visual signals are especially utilized when males defend territories against conspecifics \n(Korzan et al., 2000; 2002).  Rival males perceive the presence or absence of this sign stimulus and as a \nresult modify their behavioral output. For instance, Korzan et al. (2000) found that male A. carolinensis \nshowed more aggressive displays towards their own mirror image if the eyespot was masked by green \npaint. Furthermore, males that had their eyespots permanently darkened by black paint became dominant \nin paired interactions (Korzan et al., 2002). Hence, manipulation of the eyespot signal can dictate social \nrank by influencing behavior of the individual viewing the signal.  The effect of the sign stimulus is \nhowever, not as potent as memory of a recent interaction with a specific opponent (Korzan et al., 2004; \nForster et al., 2005; Summers et al., 2005b; see 4.3 Opponent recognition).   \n Not suprisingly, males that express the eyespot signal first become dominant in paired contests \nwhen visual cues have not been experimentally manipulated (Summers and Greenberg, 1994; Larson and \nSummers, 2001).  Thus, it would appear that a rapid and large catecholamine response to social challenge \nis indicative of a pro-active stress coping style even in lizards. In the study of Larson and Summers \n(2001) latency to eyespot darkening was delayed by treatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor \nsertraline, which in turn lead to lower social status. Hence, it could be hypothesized that differences in \nbrain serotonergic activity mediating individual differences in behavior and physiology exist prior to \nsocial interaction. Whether such differences predict social rank in Anolis was later tested by Summers et \nal. (2005a). \n \n4.2 Predicting social dominance \nLike the rainbow trout, A. carolinensis posses behavioral and physiological characteristics that make it \npossible to predict future social standing of an individual prior to agonistic interaction (Summers et al., \n2005a, Korzan et al., 2006b).  Korzan et al. (2006b) found that males responding to stimuli, such as the \npresentation of a receptive female or food, with a shorter latency than an opponent will become dominant \nin the majority of paired interactions (see table III for summary).  The fact that the latency to respond to \nstimuli allows accurate prediction of future dominant status was later used by Summers et al. (2005a,c) to \nstudy serotonergic and corticosterone responses in males destined to achieve dominant or subordinate \nsocial status. These authors found that among future dominant individuals baseline serotonergic activity \nwas reduced in the septum, nucleus accumbens, striatum, medial amygdala, anterior hypothalamus, \nraphe, and locus ceruleus, but not in the hippocampus, lateral amygdala, preoptic area, substantia nigra, \nor ventral tegmental area. In the lizard model, higher baseline levels of circulating corticosterone was \nfound to predict social dominance (Summers et al., 2005c).  Corticosterone and serotonergic activity also \nrises faster in animals that become dominant (Summers et al., 2005c). These authors suggested that even \nif the permissive effect of glucocorticoids on aggression does not suggest an active role for the hormone, \nthese steroids may be necessary for full expression of aggressive behavior (Summers et al, 2005c).  \nIn summary, similar to rainbow trout male A. carolinensis exhibit differences in stress coping \nstrategies that predict future social status.  The shorter the latency to respond to any stimulus reliably \npredicts behavioral output and future social standing. These behavioral predictors of dominance are \nunderlain by more rapid neural changes in monoamines and plasma hormones during stressful social \nconfrontation. \n \n4.3 Opponent recognition \nAmong male A. carolinensis behavioral output is potently influenced by direct aggression, stereotyped \ndisplays of aggressive intent, and visual sign stimuli (Summers and Greenberg, 1994; Korzan et al., \n2000; 2002). None of these social signals are, however, as potent as memory of previous opponents \n(Forster et al., 2005; Summers et al., 2005b).  This results in relatively stable dominant-subordinate \nrelationships, which may last up to a week (Larson and Summers 2001; Forster et al., 2005), and \nindividual lizards remember specific opponents also when reintroduced after separation of socially \ninteracting pairs. Learning opponent identity and, perhaps, appropriate behavior for specific social \nsettings appears to be influenced by the hippocampus, where NMDA receptors (particularly those that \ninclude the NR2B subunit) increase during social interaction (Meyer et al., 2004).  \nThis effect is not associated to learned or conditioned defeat, because defeat alone will not inhibit \naggressive behavior.  That is, males reintroduced to the same male whose domination created their \nsubordinate status one, three or seven days earlier, respond with a dramatically reduced aggressive \nresponse, and the previous social order is maintained.  However, males that lose a first interaction to one \nmale significantly increase their aggressive output during a second interaction with a different opponent, \nbut still dominant male (that is, this dominant male has recently won an aggressive interaction with a \ndifferent male) three days later (Forster et al., 2005).  Although social rank relationships remain \nrelatively stable, this time period is limited.  After ten days, aggressiveness increases between previously \npaired lizards and approximately half of the social rank relationships are reversed.    \nThese data suggest that proactive and reactive strategies are plastic and limited temporally in the \nlizards; perhaps because their adaptive value may change with time and the neuroendocrine condition of \nthe potential opponent.  Most likely, altered behavioral strategies are dependent on changes in neural \nmechanisms.  For instances, elevation in dopaminergic activity may increase aggression (Kramarcy et al., \n1984) or shorten latency to attack (H\u00f6glund et al., 2001) and increases the propensity for dominant status \n(Winberg and Nilsson, 1992).  Chronically elevated serotonergic activity, on the other hand, inhibits \naggression, and may reverse dominant status (Larson and Summers, 2001; Summers et al., 2005b).  The \nplasticity of pro- and reactive strategies, while rare, may follow because social rank must occasionally be \nreassessed, and adopting a more proactive strategy for a second interaction may be adaptive.     \n \n5. Observations in other species, synthesis, and discussion \n5.1. Stress and cognition \nIn both animals and man an increasing amount of evidence suggests that psychological processes \nassociated to how an individual assesses a given situation might be equally important factors as the actual \nphysical challenge in determining the severity of the stress response (Von Holst, 1998; Ursin and \nEriksen, 2004; Eriksen et al., 2005). Expectancy of the outcome of stimuli is one example of a powerful \ncognitive modulator of the stress response. Furthermore, in several laboratory reared rodent lines it also \nappears that genetically determined differences in stress coping characteristics are associated with \ndivergence in cognitive ability (e.g. Castellano et al., 1999, Nguyen et al., 2000, Balogh and Wehner, \n2003, Brennan, 2004) and, vice versa, if one selects for variation in cognitive ability, concomitant \ndifferences in stress coping style arise (e.g. Giorgi et al., 2003; Steimer and Driscoll, 2003; Aguilar et al., \n2004). In particular, rodents exhibiting behavioral and physiological traits typical of a reactive stress \ncoping style perform poorly in the acquisition of a conditioned response in aversive trials (e.g. Willig et \nal., 1991). Similarly, in an unselected population, individual differences in cognitive performance in \nrodents have been shown to predict stress induced corticosterone release and mesolimbic levels of brain \nmonoamine neurotransmitters (Tomie et al., 2000).  \n It is well known that chronic stress and exposure to glucocorticoid hormones may impair memory \nand learning (see e.g. McEwen and Sapolsky, 1995; McEwen, 2000; Roozendaal, 2002; Wolf, 2003 for \nreviews). It is far from clear, however, whether the association between stress coping style and cognition  \nreflect acute effects of circulating glucocorticoids (Oitzl et al., 1998; Beylin and Shors, 2003), \norganizational effects of chronic differences in hormone exposure during development (Catalani, 1997; \nSteimer et al., 1998; McEwen, 2000; Grootendorst et al., 2001; Meaney, 2001), or inherent differences in \nbrain function. There is also a possible evolutionary implication of the relationship between \nglucocorticoids, cognition and behavior that is rarely discussed: It has been hypothesized that proactive \nbehavioral responses are maladaptive under repeated, uncontrollable or unpredictable stress (Haller et al., \n1998; Wingfield, 2003). Proactive responses should instead be attempted against known controllable \nstressors where the outcome of the behavior can be predicted. It follows that a reduced capacity to make \nuse of memories of actual events may decrease controllability and predictability, which in turn should \nincrease HPI\/HPA-axis activation, and inhibit proactive behavior. The results of Moreira et al. (2004), \nsuggesting a more rapid extinction of conditioned responses in the HR rainbow trout, are clearly in line \nwith this argument.  \n   \n5.2. Mechanisms behind variation in stress responsiveness  \nIn the following we review some potential mechanisms that may be involved in heritable variation in the \nstress response. First, we have concentrated on those biochemical pathways where polymorphisms \naltering gene function already have been related to stress coping or other personality traits in mammalian \nspecies, as this provides evidence that mutations in these genes can survive in a population. Thereafter, \nwe the review the possible role of brain structural plasticity and the process of neurogenesis in the \nassociation between physiological, behavioral and cognitive traits. \n \n5.2.1 Cortisol production and interrenal sensitivity to adrenocorticotrophic hormone \nThe behavioral differences between HR and LR trout are consistent with some reported effects of \ncorticosteroid hormones in poikilotherms (decreased appetite: Gregory and Wood, 1999; increased \nlocomotor activity: Cash and Holberton, 1999; \u00d8verli et al., 2002a). In fish, like in mammals, these \nsteroids have time-, context-, and dose-dependent effects on behavior (\u00d8verli et al., 2002a). Cognitive \neffects of cortisol have to our knowledge not been reported in teleost fish, but the conserved nature of the \ncentral signal systems in the stress response suggest that such effects are present.  \n Pottinger and Carrick (2001b) reported that stress-induced adrenocorticotrophic hormone \n(ACTH) levels are similar in HR and LR fish, but exogenous ACTH elevated plasma cortisol levels to a \nsignificantly greater extent in HR than LR fish. Hence, interrenal sensitivity to ACTH is different in HR \nand LR fish. Corticosteroids are synthesized from cholesterol by side chain cleavage mediated by the \nenzymatic activity of the P450SCC complex located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Pregnenolone, \nthe product of this cleavage, then undergoes a series of isomerizations and hydroxylations to produce \ncortisol. In mammals, it has been shown that this synthetic activity depends on the availability of \ncholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane. One of the factors that regulates this availability is the \nsteroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), a sterol transport protein, which allows rapid transport of \ncholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane following an acute stimulus, thereby \nmaking the precursor available to P450SCC. \n A multitude of genetic polymorphisms are known in this pathway in humans (see e.g. Wedell and \nLuthman, 1993; Stratakis and Rennert, 1999), which are all connected with debilitations in untreated \npatients. Polymorphisms in corresponding genes could be present, but have less severe effects, in the \ntetraploid trout genome. Furthermore, an ACTH receptor promoter polymorphism that results in a lower \npromoter activity in vitro and lower cortisol secretion in response to ACTH stimulation in vivo was \nrecently reported by Slawik et al. (2004). Hence, the possibility should be explored that differences in \nstress induced cortisol concentrations might arise from differences in interrenal function and sensitivity, \nrather than in central HPI\/HPA-axis control. On the other hand, variability in adrenal function does not \nhave to be of genetic origin. For instance, seasonal variations in stress-induced plasma corticosteroid \nlevels have been correlated to alterations in adrenocortical steroidogenic capacity in lizards (Sceloporus \nundulatus) (Carsia and John-Alder, 2003).   \n \n5.2.2 Brain neurotransmitter systems  \nIn humans and other mammals it has long been recognized that genetically determined alterations in the \nbrain serotonin system is associated with personality and temperamental traits, as well as the propensity \nto develop mood disorders. The most well known examples are polymorphisms in monoamine oxidase \nand the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene or promoter region (Lesch et al., 1996; Shih et al., 1999; \nFernandez et al., 2003). Glucocorticoid hormones regulate the expression of 5-HTT, but the response to \nthese hormones is attenuated in the 5-HTT 'short' type (Glatz et al., 2003). Thus, it could be proposed \nthat the functional link between 5-HTT polymorphisms and personality traits is, at least in part, \ndependent on interaction with glucocorticoid hormones. \n In the HR-LR trout model, it seems likely that other monoamine neurotransmitters, and \nneuropeptides such as corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH, or corticotrophin releasing factor, CRF) \nare also involved in determining behavioral profile. In juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus \ntshawytscha), intracerebroventricular injections of CRH induced hyperactivity, an effect that was shown \nto depend on concurrent 5-HT activation (Clements et al., 2003). Interestingly, CRH administration also \nincreases dopamine concentrations in dorsal medial hypothalamus of newts (Taricha granulosa) (Lowry \net al., 2001), and one of the main neurochemical differences between HR and LR rainbow trout is that \nHR fish respond to stress by increased DA concentrations and turnover in several brain areas, while LR \nfish do not (\u00d8verli et al., 2001).  \nIncreased DA synthesis and release may, however, also be an effect of acute elevations in \nglucocorticoid concentrations (Barrot et al., 2001). Furthermore, genetically determined differences in \nDA systems have been reported in several mamallian models (Rots et al., 1996a,b,c; Lecca et al., 2004). \nThus, at present it is not known whether differences in DA systems between HR and LR trout are a cause \nor a consequence of hormone dynamics, but there are interesting parallels to mammalian models which \nsuggest the presence of evolutionary conserved trait correlations. For instance, a negative relationship \nbetween DA reactivity and social competitive ability has been demonstrated in cynomolgus monkeys \n(Macaca fascicularis) (Morgan et al., 2000).  \nThe physiological and behavioral role of brain dopaminergic systems has also been studied in the \nAnolis model (e.g Waters et al., 2005; Korzan et al., 2006a). Elevated motivation requires dopaminergic \naction (Phillips et al., 2003), and aggressive social interaction stimulates dopaminergic as well as \nserotonergic activity in limbic brain regions (Miczek et al., 2002; Winberg and Nilsson, 1992).  \nDopaminergic activity in different brain regions appear to influence aggression (Kramarcy et al., 1984; \nH\u00f6glund et al., 2005), social status (Winberg and Nilsson, 1992), motor activity (Waters et al., 2005), \nlearning, and perhaps most important, motivation and reward (Korzan et al., 2006a).  All of these factors \ninfluence social interaction, and are integrated as a part of neural regulation of social stress.  During \nsocial interactions between male A. carolinensis increased hypothalamic DA, and increased DA in \nsubstantia nigra and ventral tegmental areas (SN\/VTA) were associated with increased aggressive \nbehavior and status (Korzan et al 2006a). Elevated dopaminergic activity is usually associated with \ngreater aggressiveness and elevated social status, but very high physiological levels may even limit \naggressive interaction (H\u00f6glund et al., 2005). \nLike in most vertebrates, locomotor activity stimulates dopaminergic activity in striatum of A. \ncarolinensis (Waters et al., 2005). However, during aggressive displays and attacks, changes observed in \ndopaminergic activity in nuclei associated with motor activity like striatum seem to be coupled with \nexpression of specific stereotyped movements associated with social communication more than general \nmotor activity (Korzan et al 2006a).  The striatum and nucleus accumbens are closely linked, as are level \nof motivation and stereotyped social behavior. Increases in DA and its metabolite 3,4-\ndihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the nucleus accumbens transpire when males effectively attain \ndominant status and may be characteristic of impetus and reward (Korzan et al., 2006a).  Effects of social \ninteraction on dopaminergic activity in hippocampal and amygdalar nuclei appear consistent with current \nliterature with neurochemical changes associated with memory formation (Korzan et al., 2006a).  \nTogether these data suggest that the combination of social signal perception, social rank, and behavioral \nmanifestation, but not any solitary factor, may be the impetus for the changes in dopaminergic activity \nassociated with formation of dominant and subordinate status. Herein, the DA systems seem to link \nbehavioral responses to stimuli, and control of stimuli influences not only the behavioral response but \nalso the neural machinery involved with these response strategies. \nOther transmitter systems that could well be involved in integrating physiological and behavioral \naspects of stress coping style are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and endorphins. Modulation of the \nstress response includes glucocorticoid feedback at the hippocampal and hypothalamic levels (De Kloet \net al, 1998) and regulation by neuronal pathways, including the GABAergic inhibitory system (Jessop, \n1999). The neurotransmitter GABA, which is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate \ncentral nervous system, inhibits the HPA-axis through its actions on GABA receptors expressed by CRH \nneurons within the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Furthermore, GABA inhibits the \nlocus ceruleus norepinephrine system (Tsigos and Chrousos, 2002). Uhart et al. (2004) recently \nestablished a link between gene polymorphism in the GABAA\u03b16 receptor subunit and stress \nresponsiveness in humans. Brain CRF neurons also express \u03bc opioid receptors and are modulated by \u03b2-\nendorphin neurons originating in the arcuate nucleus. In humans a polymorphism in the extracellular N-\nterminal domain of \u03bc opioid receptor has been identified (Bergen et al. 1997; Wendel and Hoehe, 1998), \nand a link to altered HPA-axis function was demonstrated by Wand et al. (2000). \n \n5.2.3 Neurogenesis and neural plasticity \nStructural processes in the brain may be highly important for behavior, mood, and cognition in both \nanimals and human beings, and are affected by a range of environmental, endocrine, and \npharmacological factors (Nilsson et al., 1999; Gould et al., 2000; Jacobs et al., 2000; Fuchs and Fl\u00fcgge, \n2001; Garcia-Verdugo et al., 2002; Nottebohm, 2002; Song et al, 2002; Shors, 2004). Several reports \nindicate that new neurons are added to continually growing structures and replace old and dying ones in \nadults of all major vertebrate taxa, a process known as neurogenesis (although see Rakic [2004] for a \ncounter argument). In mammals, chronic stress, glucocorticoids, aging, and repeated exposure to opiate \ndrugs decrease adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Kuhn et al., 1996; Kempermann et al., 1998; Gould et \nal., 1997; Eisch et al., 2000), while voluntary exercise, enriched environments, and hippocampal-\ndependent learning increase neurogenesis (Gould et al., 1999; van Praag et al., 1999; Ambrogini et al., \n2000). Increased adult neurogenesis also correlates with improved performance in hippocampal-\ndependent learning tasks (Nilsson et al., 1999; van Praag et al., 1999). These results have received a great \ndeal of attention due to their implicit conclusion that more hippocampal neurons equal better memory \nfunction. Whether adult neurogenesis truly generates new nerve cells remains debated, although, in their \nreview, Kempermann et al. (2004) submit ample evidence for function and contribution within cognitive \nprocesses. Reduced brain cell proliferation has also repeatedly been linked to depression and depression-\nlike behavioral patterns (see e.g. Duman et al., 1999; Jacobs et al., 2000; Kempermann and Kronenberg, \n2003).  \n Compared to mammals, teleost fish and other non-mammalian vertebrates have a much higher \ndegree of adult neurogenesis (Zupanc, 2001). The size of a teleost brain increases with age, body weight \nand body length throughout life, and adult proliferation has been observed within all major teleost brain \nstructures (Birse et al., 1980; Leyhausen et al., 1987; Brandstatter and Kotrschal, 1990; Zupanc and \nHorschke, 1995). Adult proliferation zones have been mapped in detail in the brains of the adult \nstickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (Ekstr\u00f6m et al., 2001), zebrafish (Zupanc et al., 2005), and gilthead \nsea bream (Sparus aurata) (Zikopoulos et al., 2000).  \n Compared to the number of anatomical and developmental studies, surprisingly little is known \nabout the functional significance of neurogenesis in teleost fish. Ekstr\u00f6m et al. (2001) noted a certain \ndegree of interindividual variation in the labeling of proliferating cells in sticklebacks. They did not, \nhowever, investigate this further in their study, and called for a systematic exploration of this issue \n(Ekstr\u00f6m et al., 2001). S\u00f8rensen (2006) recently showed that brain cell proliferation was reduced in \nsocially subordinate rainbow trout, as compared to socially isolated and undisturbed controls. Similar \nobservations have been made in mammals (Gould et al., 1997). It is not known, however, whether \nreduced brain cell proliferation is an effect of a general inhibition in growth rate, an effect of stress, or a \npersistent feature predisposing certain individuals for a subordinate social position and reactive behavior.\n The above results warrant investigating whether rates of brain cell proliferation and neurogenesis \ndiffer between HR and LR trout lines, or predict social status in non-selected populations. The proteins \nneeded for cell proliferation and cell fate determination are often highly conserved through evolution, \nand one would not expect to find functional polymorphisms in their genes that can be linked to altered \nstress responsiveness. Several systems with a regulatory role in cell proliferation, including the brain \nserotonergic system, are, on the other hand, likely to show such polymorphism. Notably, Veenema et al. \n(2004) recently demonstrated that there are several differences in HPA-axis responsiveness, 5-HT \nresponsiveness, and hippocampal cell proliferation in mouse lines selected for divergence in aggressive \nbehavior.  \n \n6. Conclusions \nBoth genetic and environmental factors (e.g. social interactions and previous exposure to stress) \ncontribute to extensive inter-individual variation in how stress affects behavior and physiology (Winberg \nand Nilsson, 1993; Koolhaas et al., 1999; Blanchard et al., 2001; Summers, 2002; Bartels et al, 2003, \nSapolsky, 2003; Sgoifo et al., 2003; Entringer et al., 2004; Wust et al., 2004a,b,c; Korte et al., 2005. \nHowever, the existence of similar trait associations in the HR-LR strains and non-selected aquaculture \npopulations of rainbow trout (\u00d8verli et al., 2004b, 2005), and the apparent parallel between stress coping \nstyles in mammals, the HR-LR trout model, and the Anolis lizard model suggests that that suites of \ncorrelated physiological and behavioral traits has been conserved by evolution. In other species variation \nin the physiological stress response is associated with a number of major axes of variation in behavior, \nincluding activity, shyness-boldness, and aggression (Korte et al., 1992, 2005; Koolhaas et al., 1999; van \nder Vegt et al., 2001; Cavigelli and McClintock, 2003; Popova et al., 2005). Such behavioral measures \nhave all been identified as major personality traits in animals across a wide range of taxa (see Gosling \nand John, 1999; Gosling, 2001).  \n Considering the tight links between neuroendocrine signal systems controlling physiological, \nemotional, and behavioral responses, and taking into account that few behaviors can be performed or \nemotions experienced without simultaneous physiological activation, one must conclude that behavioral \nsyndromes observed in behavioral ecology (Sih et al., 2004), stress coping style (Koolhaas et al., 1999), \nand psychological and behavioral components of personality (Gosling, 2001) may all be reflections of \nthe same phenomenon - individuality in the stress response. The fact that stress coping characteristics \ndepend on genes as well as experience (and can even be transferred between parents and offspring by a \nmultitude of non-genetic mechanisms) is therefore relevant to the interpretation of results from all \nbiological research on live animals, and may provide a common conceptual framework uniting subjects \nas seemingly different as speciation and personality psychology. \n \nReferences \nFigure legends \n \nFigure 1.
