Three different sizes of sediment ~d50=0.77, 1.99, and\n3.96 mm! were fed into the flow at two different rates ~0.003 and 0.006 kg\/m\/s!, and subsequently transported as bed load. Particle image\nvelocimetry ~PIV! was used to determine the turbulence characteristics over the fixed bed during clear water and sediment feed cases.\nMean longitudinal flow velocities at any given depth were lower than their clear water counterparts for all but one of the mobile sediment\ncases. The exception was with the transport of fine grains at the higher feed rate. In this case, longitudinal mean flow velocities increased\ncompared to the clear water condition. The coarse grains tended to augment bed roughness, but fine grains saturated the troughs and\ninterstices in the bed topography, effectively causing the influence of bed irregularities to be smoothed. The PIV technique permitted\nexamination of both temporal and spatial fluctuations in flow variables: therefore many results are presented in terms of double-averaged\nquantities ~in temporal and spatial domains!. In particular, the form-induced stress, which arises from spatially averaging the Reynolds\naveraged Navier\u2013Stokes equations and is analogous to the Reynolds turbulent stress, contributed between 15 and 35% of the total\nmeasured shear stress in the roughness layer. Flow around protrusive roughness elements produced a significant proportion of the\nturbulent kinetic energy shear production, suggesting that this process is highly intermittent near rough beds.\nDOI: 10.1061\/~ASCE!0733-9429~2005!131:7~576!\nCE Database subject headings: Sediment transport; Bed loads; Turbulence; Open channel flow; Hydrodynamics; Channel beds.Introduction\nThe majority of natural and man-made open-channel flows ~e.g.,\nriver channels and canals! are fully developed turbulent flows\nover rough mobile beds.

Redistribution subject to Anamics in alluvial rivers. Although many studies have focussed on\nthe effect of mean flow properties on sediment transport, rela-\ntively few have considered the converse, i.e., the influence such\ntransport exerts on the mean and turbulent flow properties. The\nimpact of sediment transport on mean velocity gradients, turbu-\nlence intensities, Reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy\n~TKE! generation is of much interest.\nInvestigations into the feedback effect of sediment transport on\nflow hydrodynamics have tended to focus on sediment trans-\nported in suspension ~e.g., Vanoni and Nomicos 1960; Wang and\nNing 1989!, or material carried both in suspension and as bed-\nload ~e.g., Muller 1973!. Relatively few studies have concentrated\npurely on bed-load transport, but there is uncertainty regarding\nthe effect of sediment transport on the mean flow and turbulence\ncharacteristics regardless of transport mode. Vanoni and Nomicos\n~1960! concluded that suspended sediment damped turbulence in-\ntensity and hence reduced flow resistance, whereas M\u00fcller ~1973!\nfound the opposite, with increased streamwise turbulence inten-\nsity in the presence of mobile sediment. This apparent contradic-\ntion is echoed in bed-load studies.\nIn general, flow resistance increases with bed-load transport\ncompared to clear water conditions ~Gust and Southard 1983;\nWang and Larsen 1994; Best et al. 1997; Song and Chiew 1997!.\nCoarse sand ~Wang and Larsen 1994! and 0.22 mm diameter\nglass spheres ~Best et al. 1997! carried as bed load resulted in\nlower longitudinal velocities, and increased velocity gradients and\nturbulence intensities in the near-bed region. This is consistent\nwith the view that bed-load collisions extract kinetic energy from\nthe mean flow leading to a near-bed momentum deficit, and hence\nreduced streamwise velocity ~Owen 1964; Smith and McLean\n1977!. Bed-load grains interact not only with the flow, but also\nSCE license or copyright; see http:\/\/pubs.asce.org\/copyright\nwith the bed. The flow acts to accelerate the grains, whereas the\nbed decelerates them until they ultimately come to rest ~Gyr and\nSchmid 1997!. However, recent work suggests that bed load can\ninstead reduce flow resistance, resulting in increased downstream\nvelocity. For example, Nikora and Goring ~2000! found that weak\ngravel bed load in a New Zealand irrigation canal increased mean\nlongitudinal flow velocities. Pitlick ~1992! reported that develop-\ning bed forms in the North Fork Toutle River, Wash. greatly in-\ncreased flow resistance, but weak bed load over a planar gravel\nbed had little effect when compared to clear water flows. Flow\nresistance may therefore be increased, decreased, or unchanged\nby bed-load transport.\nRecent studies @e.g., Gore and Crowe 1989 ~suspended sedi-\nment!; Carbonneau and Bergeron 2000 ~bed load!# have at-\ntempted to clarify the apparent contradiction regarding flow resis-\ntance in sediment transporting flows. Carbonneau and Bergeron\n~2000! used a well-sorted gravel sd50=7.4 mmd for their fixed bed\nand bed-load sediment, and conducted four smooth bed and three\nrough bed experiments with varying transport rate. For two of\nthree rough bed runs, bed-load transport caused an increase rather\nthan a decrease of flow velocity, demonstrating that the effect of\nsuch sediment transport on mean flow characteristics is complex.\nRegardless of whether bed-load transport increases, decreases,\nor has a negligible effect on flow resistance, it is clear that mean\nand turbulent flow properties over a mobile bed may differ sig-\nnificantly from those over a fixed bed. However, the available\ninformation on potential differences is still limited and relates to\nfairly narrow ranges of control parameters and\/or experimental\nscenarios. For example Best et al. ~1997! used uniform glass\nspheres for both the fixed bed and bed-load sediment such that the\neffects of fine sediment filling the fixed bed pore space could not\nbe addressed. It is possible that the response of the flow would be\naltered if the rolling bed-load grains could be freely exchanged\nwith troughs and pores in the bottom sediment. Thus the decision\nto use mixed grain sized sediments as bed load in this study\nprovides an increased level of complexity over some previous\nstudies. In particular, the influence of varying bed-load sediment\nsize distributions and transport rates on turbulence characteristics\nand mean velocities requires clarification.\nIn this paper we examine the effects on turbulent flow struc-\nture of three different sizes of feed material ~d50=0.77, 1.99, and\n3.96 mm! transported as bed load over a nonporous fixed planar\nbed sd50=1.95 mmd. Furthermore, data collection by means of a\nparticle image velocimetry ~PIV! system has enabled quantifica-\ntion and visualization of the spatial variability in the time-\naveraged flow field, such as form-induced stresses and the occur-\nrence of localized TKE production \u201chot spots.\u201d\nExperimental Conditions\nThe experiments were carried out in a recirculating hydraulic\nflume 12.5 m long and 0.3 m wide. The flow depth varied be-\ntween 64 and 68 mm, resulting in a width-to-depth ratio sB \/Hd of\napproximately 4.5. R=U\u00af R \/n was on the order of 25,000 and the\nFroude number F=U\u00af \/ \u02dbsgRd varied from 0.82 to 0.84, where U\u00af is\nthe cross-sectional mean flow velocity, R is the hydraulic radius, n\nis kinematic viscosity, and g is gravity acceleration. For all ex-\nperiments, the slope of the flume was set to 1\/250 and a constant\ndischarge of 11 L\/s was set. Uniform flow was maintained\nthroughout. A sediment mixture ~with a d50 value of\n1.95 mm\u2014see Fig. 1! was glued to the smooth wooden base of\nJO\nDownloaded 07 Apr 2009 to 139.133.7.38. Redistribution subject to Athe flume to provide a constant uniform bed roughness. All mea-\nsurements were conducted for hydraulically rough bed conditions,\nwith the roughness Reynolds number R*=u*d50\/n.100, where\nu* is friction velocity.\nIn each experiment the flow structure over the fixed bed with\nno sediment transport was measured ~\u201cclear water\u201d!, and then the\nflow structure was measured during the bed-load transport of fine\nsd50=0.77 mmd, medium sd50=1.99 mmd, and coarse sd50\n=3.96 mmd grains fed at two different rates ~0.003 and\n0.006 kg\/m\/s!. The size distributions of the fed sediment are\nshown in Fig. 1. The feeding sediment was transported purely as\nbed load with grains rolling rather than saltating. However, as the\nsize of the feeding sediment increased the grains tended to be-\ncome temporarily lodged on the fixed bed. Therefore, to ensure\nthat the initial fixed bed roughness had not changed across all\ntrials, the bed surface was brushed before commencing each ex-\nperiment. The sediment was fed into the flow at a constant feed\nrate via a hopper attached to a gearing mechanism placed 3.34 m\nupstream of the flow measurement area. The transport capacity of\nthe flow always exceeded the bed-load feed rate, such that the\nbed-load transport rate was equal to the feed rate. Thus, all mobile\nsediment was transported right through the whole length of the\nflume. No bedforms were developed. Changes to turbulent struc-\nture due to both the size and rate of the transported sediment in\nthe absence of bedforms could therefore be examined. Table 1\nprovides information on the bed shear stresses, shear velocities,\nand Shields parameter for all experiments.\nMeasurement and Analysis Techniques\nParticle Image Velocimetry\nPIV was used to record flow velocities as it offers a number of\nadvantages, for example fluid velocities over the entire flow depth\ncan be measured synchronously in a nonintrusive manner. Addi-\ntionally it is possible to calculate the mean bed level within the\nmeasurement window directly from the recorded PIV images ~by\ntaking the average elevation of the bed topography!. PIV relies on\nstroboscopic illumination of a plane area of the flow which has\nbeen seeded with small neutrally buoyant particles. Conifer pollen\nwith a mean diameter of 50 mm was used as the seeding material.\nMultiply exposed PIV images were obtained from a vertical plane\nFig. 1.

As the polygonal mirror rotates, each face catches the laser\nbeam and reflects the light to scan across the parabolic mirror.\nThis in turn reflects the scanning beam vertically downwards\nthrough the seeded flume flow, allowing individual pollen par-\nticles to be illuminated. The scanning beam passed through the\nentire recording area every 1.8 ms. Individual particles were\ntherefore illuminated for a brief instant each time the scanning\nbeam passed. In all experiments the laser beam scanned a flow\narea in the center line of the flume, and video images were\ntaken in the vertical sx ,zd plane for a flow area of\n67 mm sstreamwised361 mm sverticald. The images were ob-\ntained 8.34 m downstream of the flume inlet. A digital camera\nwith a resolution of 1,000 by 1,000 pixels and an exposure time\nof 32 ms was used to record the flow field at a frequency of\n16.7\u00b10.2 Hz. The selected exposure time of the camera enabled\nindividual seeding particles to be recorded between 10 and 17\ntimes in each image, thus providing a displacement record for the\nparticles recorded in the measurement plane as shown in Fig.\n2~b!. Each experiment involved recording for 250 s.\nThe software package VISIFLOW ~AEA Technology, Oxford-\nshire, United Kingdom! was used for PIV analysis, which in-\nvolved splitting each of the digitized frames into a grid of inter-\nrogation areas. The interrogation areas overlapped each other by\n75%. Each interrogation area corresponded to a physical flow\narea of 4.29 mm by 4.29 mm, and was analyzed using the auto-\ncorrelation method ~Shand 1996! to establish the average dis-\nplacement of the particles within the area. Division of the dis-\nplacement value by the time interval between each particle\nillumination resulted in a velocity magnitude. This magnitude\nplus the displacement orientation gives a flow velocity vector in\nTable 1.

Redistribution subject to Athe vertical plane, which was position-7ed at the center of the\ninterrogation area. The analysis routine for each image produced\n3,481 instantaneous velocity vectors.\nThe PIV vector maps contained a number of erroneous vectors\nbecause the autocorrelation routine had computed the average dis-\nplacement incorrectly. Erroneous vectors were generated if there\nwas insufficient seeding in a particular interrogation area, or if\nlarge displacements moved the pollen particles out of the interro-\ngation area before subsequent illuminations. Due to the large\nnumber of frames being analyzed it was necessary to automate a\nvelocity vector validation procedure. The chosen method was\nbased on the work of Westerweel ~1994!, who classified vectors\nas erroneous if they varied significantly from their nearest neigh-\nbors. In this investigation, eight neighboring vectors were aver-\naged and vectors varying by more than 2 standard deviations from\nthe average value were defined as erroneous and deleted. The\nmajority of erroneous vectors were concentrated near the bed\nwhere the interrogation areas began to overlap with the bed ma-\nterial. Also, the PIV autocorrelation algorithm cannot resolve\nnegative ~upstream! velocities where flow separates in the wake\nof individual grains. Therefore no data are presented for the re-\ngion below the roughness tops. Furthermore, flow data were po-\ntentially compromised as bed-load sediment intermittent passed\nthrough the video field. Hence the authors propose a cautionary\napproach to data interpretation for the bottom 5% of the flow\nimmediately above the fixed bed in the bed-load transport cases.\nOther inaccuracies associated with PIV analysis are: pixelation of\nthe digital images that results in small errors in locating the cor-\nrelation peak used to determine particle displacement, and hence\nvelocity, and averaging particle velocities across an interrogation\narea, which is most sensitive in areas near the bed with large\niment\ne 1, 2\nMedium sediment\nfeed rate 1, 2\nCoarse sediment\nfeed rate 1, 2\n2.53 2.67, 2.64 2.78, 3.23\n0.052 0.053, 0.054 0.054, 0.058\n0.20 0.08, 0.08 0.04, 0.05\ned level.\nicle image velocimetry images; ~b! autocorrelation particle image\nom left to right!ine sed\need rat\n2.75,\n.054,\n0.22,\nmean br part\nis frSCE license or copyright; see http:\/\/pubs.asce.org\/copyright\n\u00afvelocity gradients. However, above the bottom 3% of the flow\nfield, these errors are of the same order as those due to pixelation.\nThe total error in velocity measurements varied from 0.5 to 4%.\nSpatially-Averaged Momentum Equations\nSmith and McLean ~1977! used spatial flow averaging to describe\nvelocity profiles above a wavy bed. Subsequently the approach\nwas developed by atmospheric physicists to provide a tool for\nassessing flow variables within plant canopies ~Wilson and Shaw\n1977; Raupach and Shaw 1982; Finnigan 1985!. Relatively re-\ncently attention has turned to the application of spatial averaging\nto open-channel flows ~Nikora et al. 2001!, for example gravel-\nbed rivers and other channels with irregular rough surfaces. Flow\nsubdivision into specific layers, based on spatial averaging meth-\nodology, is shown in Fig. 3 ~Nikora et al. 2001!. In this figure, the\nterm roughness sublayer, used in atmospheric literature, is re-\nferred to as the roughness layer, as the roughness layer is itself\nsubdivided into interfacial and form-induced sublayers lying im-\nmediately below and above the roughness tops, respectively ~see\nFig. 3!. The term roughness layer has been adopted in this paper.\nIn spatial-averaging methodology, the Navier-Stokes equations\nare first time-averaged in the conventional way to produce the\nReynolds averaged Navier\u2013Stokes ~RANS! equations. This is\nthen supplemented by averaging over a volume or plane large\nenough to eliminate local variation in the mean flow due to bed\ntopography ~just as the temporal averaging time scale is chosen to\neliminate the effect of turbulent fluctuations on the mean veloc-\nity!. Supplementing Reynolds averaging with spatial averaging\nyields extra, physically meaningful terms including form drag and\nform-induced stress. Further details can be found in e.g. Raupach\nand Shaw ~1982!, Gimenez-Curto and Corniero Lera ~1996!, or\nNikora et al. ~2001!.

The obvious\nexceptions are the last three terms. Taken in turn from left to\nright, these three terms represent the form-induced momentum\nflux, viscous drag, and form drag terms. The Reynolds stresses\ns\u2212rui8uj8d arise by substitution of mean su\u00afid and fluctuating sui8d\nvelocity components ~i.e., ui= u\u00afi+ui8! into the Navier\u2013Stokes\nequation to obtain the Reynolds-averaged momentum equation\n~RANS!.

Hence the total fluid stress t, has three components:\nviscous, turbulent, and form-induced ~or dispersive! stresses.

Many results pre-\nsented in the next section were therefore determined by a spatial\naveraging procedure. This process involved initial temporal aver-\naging across the entire time series ~4,200 frames at 16.7 Hz! be-\nfore spatial averaging along lines of constant distance from the\nmean bed in each vector field. The spatial averaging area was\nchosen to be representative of the fixed sediment bed topography\nthroughout the flume.\nResults\nReynolds Shear Stresses\nVerification of two-dimensional ~2D! flow conditions by demon-\nstrating the linearity of the Reynolds stress distribution provides a\nlogical starting point for presenting results. If adequately linear,\nthe turbulent shear stress distributions, tt, also offer an appropri-\nate tool for evaluating bed shear stress t0 and subsequently the\nshear velocity u* ~Nezu and Nakagawa 1993!.

This was expected as the aspect ratio ~flume width\/flow\ndepth, B \/H! is close to 5 ~Song and Graf 1994; Graf 1998!. The\nprimary shear stress deviates from linear in the near-bed region,\nindicating the presence of a roughness layer. This layer exists\nbecause the boundary imparts several momentum transformation\nmechanisms such as form drag, form-induced stresses, and when\nbed-load conditions prevail, an interaction between the flow and\nmoving sediment. Fig. 4 indicates that the thickness of the rough-\nness layer increased as the flow carried coarser material. The\nshear stress, \u2212rku8w8l reached a maximum at z<6 mm for the\nclear water cases, but the corresponding heights for the fine,\nmedium, and coarse feeds were z<10 mm, z<13 mm, and\nz<16 mm, respectively. This trend of increasing roughness layer\nthickness with increasing bed-load feed size appears to be inde-\npendent of sediment transport rate.\nMean Velocities and Turbulence Intensities\nFigs. 5 and 6 show vertical distributions of double-averaged lon-\ngitudinal velocity plotted semi-logarithmically with the vertical\ncoordinate, z, normalized with mean flow depth H. Fig. 5 illus-\ntrates the influence of varying sediment size, whereas Fig. 6 in-\ndicates the relative importance of feed rate. Fig. 5~a! ~lower feed\nrate, 0.003 kg\/m\/s! reveals that for z \/H\u01420.3 the shift in velocity\nprofiles is directly related to the sediment feed size, with the\ncoarsest bed-load material causing the greatest retardation of lon-\ngitudinal velocity. This effect has been observed to occur in\nsediment-laden flows and represents an increase in roughness\n~e.g., Best et al. 1997!. Whether this is due to transient changes in\nbed roughness, or to dynamic roughness effects induced by mov-\ning sediment remains unclear. It is however worth noting that the\ncoarse feed material had a tendency to become temporarily\nlodged on the fixed bed thereby intermittently forming transient\nclusters. Hence, the velocity profile shift for this case was at least\npartly attributable to increased ~albeit temporarily! bed roughness\nFig. 4.

The primary difference between the two feed rates is the\nflow behavior when fine sediment is transported. Feeding fine\nsediment at the lower feed rate s0.003 kg\/m\/sd results in lower\ndownstream mean velocities throughout the flow depth as com-\npared to the clear water case. However, when the feed rate of fine\nbed-load is doubled to 0.006 kg\/m\/s, this velocity shift is re-\nversed and mean longitudinal velocities are consistently higher\nthan the clear water case. This effect is discussed further with\nreference to Figs. 6~a\u2013d!.\nFig. 6~a! illustrates the repeatability of the PIV data acquisition\nprocess, as the clear water velocity profiles obtained from Trials 1\neriments.

The effect of increasing feed rate\nwith the medium-sized bed-load material is negligible @Fig. 6~c!#.\nThis is not true for either the fine or coarse sediment. Fig. 6~b!\nshows that feeding fine material at the higher rate reverses the\ninitial shift in velocity profile observed with the lower feed rate,\nas noted when discussing Fig. 5~b!. As the fine feed material\nsd50=0.77 mmd was transported through, and collected in the in-\nterstices of the bed surface, this effect was probably due to a\ndecrease in the effective roughness of the bed. It is possible that\nsuch bed smoothing could only be fully realized when surplus\nbed-load material was made available at the higher feed rate and\nwhen the size distributions of the bed and mobile sediment per-\nmitted free exchange of the rolling bed-load grains with the inter-\nstices of the fixed bed.\nWhiting and Dietrich ~1990! concluded that flow resistance\nwith bed load was indistinguishable from clear water flows. They\nsuggested that the coarse bed-load fraction moves by rolling\nslowly over the bed compared to the fluid velocity, and that mo-\nmentum dissipation by the drag of the bed occurs in the same\nmanner as over immobile beds. Furthermore, the fine bed-load\nfraction moves below the tops of the large grains and grains clus-\nters and has negligible effect on flow resistance. Whereas Whiting\nand Dietrich ~1990! had the same sediment compositions for the\nbed and bed-load grains, this study introduces bed-load size frac-\ntions much smaller and larger than the fixed bed sediment. Figs. 5\nand 6 show that both bed-load size and transport rate exert a more\ncomplex influence on the mean flow velocity than that proposed\nby Whiting and Dietrich ~1990!. However, their observation that\nflow resistance is indistinguishable for bed load and clear water\nflows is supported by our experiments involving the bed-load\ntransport of medium grains. In this case, where the fixed bed and\nbed-load size fractions are similar ~Fig. 1! the mean flow is rela-\ntively unaffected compared to the clear water condition.\nAs there is no strong physical justification for the existence of\na well-developed logarithmic layer with the combinations of flow\ndepth and roughness heights in this study, no log law parameters\nwere calculated from the velocity profile. For example, in the\nclear water cases the characteristic roughness height sd=d50d was\n1.95 mm, and the flow depth sHd was 66 mm. Hence we would\nFig. 6.

For the sediment feed cases, the logarithmic layer\ndiminishes as it becomes squeezed between the thickening rough-\nness layer and the outer layer, and it would therefore be mislead-\ning to assess variables ~e.g., shear velocity, roughness lengths,\neddy viscosity! based on the log law.\nIn all experiments the double averaged vertical velocity re-\nmained close to zero ~Fig. 7!, suggesting that there was no con-\nsistent organized vertical momentum flux.

The spatially averaged TKE shear produc-\ntion profiles ~Fig. 10! reveal suppressed turbulent energy genera-\ntion very close to the bed for all transporting cases. Above z \/H\n=0.1, flows carrying bed load generally exhibited higher turbulent\nshear production compared to the clear water cases, with the de-\ngree of increase being dependent on bed-load particle size ~largest\nparticles causing the greatest increase!. The TKE production for\nthe experiments \u201ccoarse 1\u201d and \u201ccoarse 2\u201d was consistently\ngreater than the clear water value through much of the flow depth.\nThis was also true for experiments \u201cmedium 1\u201d and \u201cmedium 2,\u201d\nbut the effect was only discernible up to z \/H<0.3. Although for\nz \/H.0.15 the fine bed-load particles increased the TKE shear\nproduction compared to the clear water case at feed rate 1\ns0.003 kg\/m\/sd, slightly decreased levels were observed for feed\nrate 2 s0.006 kg\/m\/sd. This again can be attributed to some de-\ngree of bed smoothing.\nThe PIV data collection also provided the opportunity to in-\nvestigate spatial variation in TKE production. This made it pos-\nsible to examine the bed topography to identify potential concen-\ntrations in TKE production. The fixed downstream particle cluster\nevident in Fig. 2~b! was therefore examined.

Studies that have considered spatial averaging of flow\nvariables thus far ~primarily within plant canopies! have proposed\nthat the maximum form-induced stress would be, at most, only a\nfew percent of the Reynolds stress in the vicinity of the bed\nroughness ~Mulhearn 1978; Raupach and Thom 1981; Raupach et\nal. 1986; Perry et al. 1987!. Fig. 13 shows that for the fixed bed,\nthe form-induced stress approached 30% of the maximum Rey-\nnolds stress. Although form-induced stress levels were reduced\nwith mobile sediment they still constituted up to 15% of the total\nmeasured fluid stress ~turbulent+form induced! in the roughness\nlayer.\nConclusions\nThis study provides new information about how turbulent flow\nstructure is affected by the size and feed rate of bed load. Veloci-\nties were measured using PIV that provided instantaneous, time-\naveraged, and double-averaged hydrodynamic fields in clear-\nwater and bed-load flows. The results of this investigation\nsupplement and support previous findings and may be summa-\nrized as follows:\n1. With increase in feeding rate, the downwards shift in mean\nlongitudinal velocity profile increased for the coarse case,\nremained constant for the medium case, and reversed for the\nfine case ~i.e., velocities in the \u201cfine 2\u201d experiment were\nhigher than observed for the clear water case!.\n2. The TKE shear production increased for all bed-load cases\nabove z \/H=0.1. The largest increase above the roughness\nlayer was observed for the coarse feed condition. The gradi-\nent of streamwise velocity increased for all bed-load cases\nacross the region 0.075\u0142z \/H\u01420.4.\n3. Local concentrations in TKE production were smoothed in\nthe fine feed case but little change was observed for the\nmedium and coarse experiments.\n4. Form-induced stress levels remained relatively constant for\nboth the medium and coarse bed particles. Increasing the\nfeed rate for the fine particles caused the average form-\ninduced stress to drop by over 50%.\n5. For all bed-load cases the form-induced stress is decreased\ncompared to the clear water experiments. Nevertheless,\nform-induced stress contributes up to 15% of the maximum\nReynolds stress in the roughness layer in the presence of bed\nload.\n6. The recorded values of su \/u* and sw \/u* increased in all\ncases for z \/H.0.25. Closer to the bed, sw \/u* decreased for\nthe coarse case and increased for the fine and medium cases,\ncompared to the clear-water values.\nAs a final note, it is important to emphasize that these results were\nobtained over a nonporous planar boundary. It is most likely that\ndifferences in momentum transfer will occur over natural, porous\nsediment beds where particles are free to move. Further work is\nrequired over such beds to develop better understanding of flow\nmodification due to bed-load transport.\n584 \/ JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING \u00a9 ASCE \/ JULY 2005\nDownloaded 07 Apr 2009 to 139.133.7.38.
