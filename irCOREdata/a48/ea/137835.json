The practice of landfilling results in a number of potentially damaging \nenvironmental impacts of which the generation of landfill leachate is just one. In \naddition to the initial moisture content of the solid waste and any liquid waste inputs, \nwater may enter landfills as a result of the ingress of precipitation, surface water or \ngroundwater. Contact between this water and the waste generates a leachate \ncontaminated with a range of soluble organic and inorganic substances. Generally, \nleachate generated from recently-filled domestic waste has a high 5 day biochemical \noxygen demand (BOD5), of about 10 000 mg\/l, and a total ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-\nN) concentration in excess of 1000 mg\/l. This is a result of the microbiological \ndegradation of organic substances under anaerobic conditions (Robinson and Maris, \n1979; Robinson and Gronow, 1992; Robinson, 1995). In older landfills the readily \nbiodegradeable compounds contributing to BOD5 are converted by a complex series of \nmicrobiological reactions to methane and carbon dioxide and may be extracted from \nthe fill as landfill gas. As there is no significant mechanism for NH3 -N transformation \nin the landfill, NH3 -N concentrations remain high in aged wastes. Landfilled waste will \ncontinue to produce leachate contaminated with NH3 -N for many years after filling \noperations have ceased (Robinson and Gronow, 1992).  \nLeachate in an untreated form is unsuitable for direct discharge into surface \nwatercourses as the high BOD and NH3-N concentrations would have a severe impact \non the ecology of the receiving water. Although effective advanced leachate treatment \nsystems exist, some landfill operators seek alternatives because of their high capital \ncosts and specialised management requirements. Land-based treatment systems are an \n 2 \nattractive alternative for landfill operators as they utilise an existing land resource, they \nare considered to be cheap to build and operate, and are not perceived to need \nsophisticated management. A land-based system is often seen as a \u201cstop-gap\u201d measure, \npermitting the investment in an expensive, advanced leachate treatment system to be \ndeferred, perhaps until the time when filling operations cease. Alternatively, land-based \nsystems may be used in conjunction with a conventional tank-based system to play a \npolishing role (Maehlum, 1995; Martin and Johnson, 1995). \nAn example of an extensive, land-based system adopted at landfill sites in the UK is the \nleachate treatment plane. Treatment planes are areas of vegetated, sloping land, usually \nconstructed using low permeability soils onto which leachate is applied from a \nrecirculation lagoon. Overland flow of leachate is encouraged by the slope, the lack of \nvertical percolation and the high rate of wastewater application. As a result, leachate \ninteracts with the upper layers of the soil and the vegetation as it returns to the \nrecirculation lagoon, hence the use of the generic term \u201coverland flow\u201d treatment \nsystem. The process of recirculation continues (perhaps for several weeks) until the \nentire batch of leachate in the lagoon reaches the required quality standard for \ndischarge.  \nA limited amount of research has been undertaken into mechanisms of NH3-N removal \non overland flow treatment systems. The principal work was reported by Kruzic and \nSchroeder (1990) following studies of systems used for the treatment of settled sewage. \nIn a series of experiments using single-pass, laboratory-scale treatment systems, they \nconcluded that: \n\u2022 a retention process (probably cation exchange) was responsible for NH3-N removed \none day and then being released in the form of nitrate on a subsequent day; \n 3 \n\u2022 nitrification is a significant process (high nitrate concentrations in the treated \nwastewater provided evidence of this); \n\u2022 denitrification is responsible for the removal of some of the NO3-N produced as a \nresult of nitrification. \nAlthough leachate treatment plane systems have been in use in the UK for many years, \nlittle is known of the treatment mechanisms involved or the factors affecting treatment \nefficiency. This paper reports the findings of studies of experimental treatment planes \ndesigned to improve our understanding of ammoniacal nitrogen dynamics in these \nengineered grassland treatment systems. \nMETHODOLOGY \nIntroduction \nOperational treatment planes may have a surface area of several hectares so it was \nconsidered desirable to build an experimental system as large as practically possible. \nAccordingly, 10 separate 25 m long x 1 m wide field-scale plots were constructed at \nSilsoe, Bedfordshire, UK. In addition to the field-scale plots, further data were obtained \nfrom experiments carried out using 2 m long x 0.4 m wide small-scale troughs.  \nField-scale plots: design, construction and operation \nThe first stage of construction was to excavate a pit (approximately 16 m long x 2.5 m \nwide x 2 m deep) to hold the 1.2 m3 reception tanks which would collect leachate \nrunoff from the plots. A reinforced concrete base was laid in the bottom of the pit and \ntied to reinforced, hollow-block retaining walls. Treatment plane preparation began on \n 4 \ncompletion of the pit. 0.4 m of topsoil was removed, using an excavator, from a 25 m x \n16 m area adjacent to the pit and stockpiled for later use. The excavator was then used \nto grade the site to give a 2% down-slope gradient and a 0% cross-slope gradient with \nthe lower end of the slope meeting the edge of the pit retaining wall. \nTen plots were then marked out in five pairs, each pair separated by a 1 metre wide \npathway for access (Figure 1). A timber frame was erected on each plot and, to prevent \nseepage from the plots, a polyethylene sheet was positioned over the wooden frame, \ncovering each pair of plots as shown in Figure 2. The stockpiled topsoil clods were \nbroken up to form smaller, more manageable aggregates with a power harrow and \ncarefully replaced inside the polythene-lined plots. The soil was then irrigated with \nfresh water for 8 hours and allowed to consolidate for a week. High and low areas on \nthe plot surfaces were evened out by raking and the level checked at 1 m intervals \ndownslope to ensure that a uniform 2% gradient was achieved. \nSeed of the grass Agrostis stolonifera was sown on the completed plots, at the \nsupplier\u2019s recommended rate (50 g\/m2). A. stolonifera was selected because it was a \ndominant member of the grassland community on two local treatment planes. At both \nsites, the grass appeared to tolerate periodic inundation with leachate with no apparent \nill effects. In pot trials, A. stolonifera has outperformed (Bradford, 1992; Boon, 1996; \nElliot, 1997), other salt-tolerant and waterlogging-tolerant grass species (e.g. Spartina \ntownsendii and Pucinellia maritima) when irrigated with raw leachate and can survive \nfor weeks submerged in water containing high concentrations of chloride.  \nA 1.2 m3 delivery tank was placed on the bund at the upper end of each of the plots. \nLandfill leachate for the experiments came from Shanks Ltd.\u2019s Calvert landfill site in \n 5 \nBuckinghamshire, UK. Calvert opened in 1980 and is classified by Robinson (1995) as \na large, relatively dry landfill with a high waste input rate. The leachate used in these \nexperiments came from a part of the landfill characterised as methanogenic with a low \nBOD (typically < 200 mg\/l). A water quality summary of the raw Calvert leachate \nduring the experimental period is given in Table 1. Leachate from the delivery tanks \nwas applied at the top of the plots using a simple weir arrangement. Runoff from the \nplots was collected in two linked 1.2 m3 reception tanks at the base of the slope.  \nThe plots were operated on a 24 hour cycle. Leachate application began at 10 a.m. and \ncontinued for 5 hours. The soil was then allowed to drain and dry for 19 hours until the \nnext application period began the following day. In their work with overland flow \nsystems for the treatment of domestic wastewater, Smith and Schroeder (1985) \ndemonstrated that continuous (24 hr\/d) application was deleterious to the treatment \nprocess. A drying period allows atmospheric oxygen to diffuse into the soil, permitting \nthe processes of organic matter and NH3 -N oxidation to proceed. The leachate was \npumped back into the delivery tanks every morning at which point samples were taken \nfor chemical analysis.  \nSmall-scale troughs: design, construction and operation \n2 m long x 0.4 m wide x 0.2 m deep troughs were constructed from mild steel sheet \nfollowing a design used previously by Pawson (1993)(Figure 3). The troughs were \npartially filled to a depth of approximately 0.1 m with the clay loam soil (Evesham \nseries) found at the experimental site at Silsoe. The soil was then covered with turf, \ntaken from an operational treatment plane run by Shanks at Calvert in \nBuckinghamshire, UK. The predominant grass species present was Agrostis stolonifera \n 6 \n(creeping bent). The troughs were positioned such that they had a 2% down-slope \ngradient and a 0% cross-slope gradient. Leachate was applied to each trough from its \nown 220 l reservoir (a polypropylene barrel) that discharged its contents via a control \nvalve to a transverse distributor pipe positioned at the upper end of the trough. At the \nlower end of the trough, leachate runoff was collected in an identical 220 l \npolypropylene barrel. The troughs were operated in the same ways as the field-scale \nplots.  \nPlot and trough experimental programme \nThe principal experimental variable under investigation was the hydraulic loading rate. \nThe hydraulic loading rate has the potential to influence the functioning of the system \nin a number of ways. At low hydraulic loading rates leachate may not be well \ndistributed leading to poor contact with the available surface area of the treatment \nplane. At higher hydraulic loading rates depth of flow will increase. This will in turn \nlead to higher velocities and lower residence times. Hydraulic loading rates were tested \nwithin the range 17 - 217 l\/m2\/d (17-217 mm\/d)(Table 2 & Table 3). This compares \nwith estimated hydraulic loading rates of 52-72 l\/m2\/d (52 mm\/d-72mm\/d) at treatment \nplanes operated by Shanks Ltd.  \nA start up plot trial served to draw attention to practical problems associated with the \nlarger-scale experiment. It was found that the 1.2 m3 capacity of the delivery tanks was \ninsufficient to sustain an experimental run of longer than 2 weeks on a 25 m2 plot due \nto water loss by evapotranspiration. For example, during hot weather, \nevapotranspiration could be 3 mm\/d, equivalent to 75 l per 25 m plot per day. This \nproblem was overcome in two ways. Firstly, plot length (and therefore area) was \n 7 \nreduced by moving the distributor trough down the plot. Thus plot lengths of 10 m or \n20 m were used to increase the hydraulic loading rate. Secondly, the delivery tank \nvolume of each plot was increased by linking the delivery tanks for two plots together \nto feed a single plot.  \nSampling and analysis \nLeachate samples were taken every weekday morning following the return of the \nleachate treated on the previous day from the reception tanks to the delivery tanks. \nPrior to sampling, the contents of each delivery tank were vigorously stirred to ensure \nthat treated leachate and any untreated leachate were thoroughly mixed (at low \nhydraulic loading rates, not all the delivery tank volume was discharged each day). All \nleachate samples were immediately refrigerated and transported in a cool box for \nlaboratory analysis.  NH3-N, NO2-N and NO3-N were measured daily by colorimetry \nusing a Hydrocheck 600C spectrophotometer (WPA Ltd, Cambridge, UK). COD, Cl-, \nand pH were also measured daily but for the sake of brevity, these data are not \ndiscussed. \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nNH3-N removal dynamics \nThe recirculation of leachate over experimental treatment planes leads to a slow, \nprogressive reduction in its NH3-N concentration over a period of several weeks. A \nsimilar pattern of NH3-N removal was produced in both the trough and the plot \nexperiments. NH3-N removal was relatively rapid during the first few days but declined \n 8 \nas the experiment proceeded. This generally gave the appearance of a curve when NH3-\nN concentration was plotted against experimental days (Figure 4). An exponential \nrelationship was found to best fit the experimental data. The best-fit line equations and \nthe associated coefficients of determination (R2) for each of the trough and plot \nexperiments are presented in Table 4. The value of k (the reaction rate constant), \nderived from the best-fit line equations, was plotted against the corresponding \nhydraulic loading rate for each experimental run (Figure 5). The scattered points and \nthe associated low value of R2 (0.0039) suggest that there is no relationship between \nhydraulic loading rate and the rate of NH3-N removal. This suggests that factors likely \nto be related to hydraulic loading rate, such as uniformity of leachate distribution and \nleachate residence time, were in fact insignificant in terms of their influence on \ntreatment performance. \nNevertheless, the values of the NH3-N removal rate constant for each of the \nexperimental runs varied considerably. Land-based treatment systems are complex and \na number of factors may influence the rate of NH3-N removal during the course of an \nexperiment. Spatial variation in the NH3-N adsorption capacity and the state of the \nnitrifying bacteria populations of the soil used might be expected. At the lower end of \nthe range of application rates used it is likely that contact between the treatment plane \nand the leachate would be diminished due to preferential flow. Temperature is also \nlikely to have had an affect on the NH3-N removal rate by affecting the rate of \nnitrification and, to a lesser extent, other microbiological and chemical processes. As \nthe experiments extended from early spring through to early autumn, it is reasonable to \nexpect that temperature would have contributed to the level of variation observed. The \nchemical and biological history of a given area of treatment plane is another factor that \n 9 \nmay have contributed to the variation observed. For example, it may take several days \nfor nitrifying bacteria in the soil to build up to optimum treatment levels following the \ninitiation of leachate application. Soil that is receiving leachate for the first time may \ndiffer microbiologically to soil that has received leachate many times before. Similarly, \nit is conceivable that chemicals may accumulate in the soil following repeated \napplications of leachate that may influence chemical adsorption or microbiological \ndegradation processes. Differences in raw leachate chemistry could also affect the \nmicrobiological activity of the treatment plane and therefore contribute to differences in \nthe NH3-N removal rate between experimental runs. High nitrite concentrations, which \nwere present in some of the batches of raw leachate taken from the Calvert landfill site, \ncould for example have had a negative effect on NH3-N oxidising bacteria through end \nproduct inhibition. Whilst it is reasonable to expect that all of the above mentioned \nfactors could have contributed to the variation observed, the relative significance of \nindividual factors is unknown.  \nA generalised NH3-N removal relationship \nThe data from the three trough experiments and two plot experiments were pooled to \nderive a generalised relationship between the rate of NH3-N removal (kg NH3-N \/ m2 \n\/d) and the leachate NH3-N concentration. For each day of each experiment, the mass of \nNH3-N removed was calculated and plotted against the leachate NH3-N concentration \nat the start of that day (Figure 6). Figure 6 suggests that there is a relationship between \nthe daily specific NH3-N mass removal rate and the NH3-N concentration. A linear \nregression line was fitted to the experimental data which indicates that there is a \nsignificant positive correlation (p=0.01) between the NH3-N removal rate and NH3-N \n 10 \nconcentration, although the regression line explains only 35% of the variation observed. \nThis relationship could be used to simulate treatment plane performance and could \nform the basis of a methodology for system design. Such a methodology would need to \ntake into account climatic factors that influence the recirculation reservoir volume, such \nas precipitation and evapotranspiration. Furthermore, the experimentally derived \nrelationship should not be applied in practice without due consideration in the design \nprocess to the amount of variation in the rate of NH3-N removal that has been shown to \noccur from batch to batch. \nFate of NH3-N removed \nA simple inorganic nitrogen balance was conducted by converting concentrations of \nNH3-N, NO2-N and NO3-N at the beginning and end of the treatment plane experiments \ninto values of mass, as presented in Table 5. In every experiment there was a significant \nreduction in the mass of inorganic nitrogen. NH3 \u2013N removal normally accounted for \nthe majority of the inorganic nitrogen removed. NO2-N removal contributed \nsignificantly to total inorganic nitrogen deficits in experiments C, D and E. NO2-N is \nnot normally a significant form of nitrogen in landfill leachate but its presence in this \ncase was attributed to inputs of NO2-N into the untreated leachate lagoon from a pilot \nleachate treatment plant operating at the Calvert landfill site. The mass of NO3-N \npresent in the treated leachate at the end of each experiment does not, however, account \nfor the mass of NH3-N and NO2-N removed. This disparity between the removal of \nreduced forms of nitrogen and the consequent production of nitrate was also observed \nby Kruzic and Schroeder (1990) on domestic wastewater overland flow systems.  \n 11 \nKruzic and Schroeder (1990) argued that cation exchange of ammonium ions at soil \nparticle surfaces would lead, in the short term at least, to the net removal of inorganic N \nfrom the water being treated. Regeneration of cation exchange sites would appear to be \nvital to the sustainable operation of a treatment plane, although in laboratory \nexperiments it has been shown that cation exchange can facilitate considerable long-\nterm NH3-N removal in soils repeatedly challenged with leachate (Tyrrel, 1999). \nGaseous nitrogen losses offer another explanation of the apparent deficit. Nitrate spike \nexperiments carried out by Kruzic and Schroeder (1990) indicated that denitrification \nwas probably occurring. Gaseous loss of ammonia to the atmosphere through the \nprocess of volatilisation may also occur. In studies of surface applied sewage sludge, \nRyan and Keeney (1975) found that between 11% - 60% of applied ammoniacal \nnitrogen was lost by volatilisation, with the variation being dependent upon soil type. \nSoils with a relatively high cation exchange capacity, such as those used in the Silsoe \nexperiments, would be expected to have relatively low volatilisation losses however. A \nfurther component of the apparent nitrogen deficit could be accounted for by \nassimilation of inorganic nitrogen into vegetation biomass. Irrigation of the Silsoe \ntroughs and plots with leachate led to luxuriant growth of Agrostis stolonifera. \nEstimates made during the course of experiment E indicated that between 3-11% of the \ntotal nitrogen deficit for that experiment could be attributed to above ground biomass \nproduction. Laboratory experiments designed to verify the mechanisms responsible for \nNH3-N removal and their relative significance have been conducted and will be \nreported elsewhere.  \n 12 \nCONCLUSIONS \n1. NH3 -N removal from leachate applied to experimental treatment planes is a slow \nprocess in comparison with conventional wastewater treatment systems. An \nexponential relationship was found to best fit the experimental data (R2 in the range \n0.83-0.99).  \n2. The rate of NH3-N removal was found to vary significantly between experimental \nruns. Although it is possible to identify possible causes of this variation it is not \nknown if they could be brought under operational control in order to obtain more \nconsistent performance. No relationship was observed between the hydraulic \nloading rate and the NH3-N removal rate constants (R2 = 0.0039). \n3. The mass of NH3 -N removed per square metre on any one day was linearly related \nto the NH3 -N concentration at the start of that day of treatment as follows: \nNH3 -N removal rate (kg\/m2\/d) = 2 x 10-5 x NH3 -N concentration (mg\/l). This \nrelationship could be used as a basis for a simple treatment plane simulation model. \nThe development of such an application must take into account the considerable \nexperimental variation observed and the need for the inclusion of climatic data so \nthat changes in leachate volume may be catered for in the calculation.  \n4. The mass of NH3-N and NO2-N removed from the leachate applied cannot be \naccounted for by NO3-N production in the final effluent. A combination of \nchemical and biological processes is likely to govern the fate of nitrogen in this \nsystem.  \n \n \n 13 \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors wish to acknowledge Martin Lowe of Shanks Ltd. for his help and advice during the course \nof this research.
