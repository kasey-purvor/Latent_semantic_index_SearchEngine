This was \ntributors and broadcasters, post-\ny for networking \n(Granovetter 1985) and face-to-face exchange of information (Nachum and Keeble 1999, 2000). \nThese face-to-face contacts, co-presence and co-location of people and firms within the same \nindustry and place, are part of a \u2018project\u2019 ecology (Grabher 2001, 2002a, 2002b, 2004a, 2004b, \nGrabher and Ibert 2006) characterized by specific types of information exchange and \ncommunication referred to variously as \u2018buzz\u2019 (Storper and Venables 2004, Bathelt, Malmberg et \n \n \nAbstract \nThere is growing evidence of the decentralization of the film and television\nLondon.

The main \nResearch on decentralization, though mainly related to financial services (Goddard and \nMorris 1976), emphasizes that companies that relocated from the centre to the periphery in order to \ngain access to cheaper and more spacious offices and parking spaces need to compensate for the \nloss of proximity to their counterparts in face-to-face contacts; first, by increasing their use of \n, Charlot and Duranton \n2006); second, by having longer travel distances; and third, by the replacement of contacts with \n\u2018industrial atmosphere\u2019 (Marshall 1920). However, the primary role of suc\nSoho in London, has been gradually eroded.1 The long-term shift of \n2 3\nnew. It relates to the idea that core\/central business district (CBD) areas hav\ncongestion levels and therefore such areas will increasingly specialize\nmpanies, which fit the criteria. However, according to the authors noted\nthe case and processes of decentralization have occurred among FTV compani\nreason put forward is the same \u2013 rising rents (Scott 2000b). \ntelecommunications (which is questionable, according to, for example\n                                                 \n1 In 1951(before the collapse of the studio system) the proportion of employed in the FTV industry (film production \nand distribution and television activities) in Westminster (including Soho) in comparison with London A.C. \n(equivalent of Inner London) was 61% ,and in 2005 only 37.1% (Source: ABI, Census).  \n2  In 1967, 55.6% of Paris metropolitan region\u2019s employment in film production was concentrated in the Eighth \narrondissement (the very centre of Paris); in 1997, only 18.2% (Scott 2000a: 19). \n3 New film production companies are located outside the dense primary cluster (from Burbank in the north and east \nthrough the central pivot of Hollywood to Beverly Hills and Santa Monica in the west) (Scott 2005).  \n 2\nbusiness partners in the CBD area by local ones. Therefore there is always interplay between the \n being part of a creative \n business counterparts and related institutions, that influences the \nlocation choice decision of the company. \nFor FTV production companies, the results of this interplay will be informed, first, by the \n4  more importantly, there \n the FTV ecology \ncomposed of a spectrum of firms with different networking practices (Grabher and Ibert 2006). \nThese essential differences will be informed by the characteristics of their individual markets, by \nonomic prosperity and \ne groups: those that \nstay in the centre and those that prefer more peripheral locations. The main candidates for \nally extended external relations, would be those with smaller \nbu mes), or those with \nters (Scott 2005) who would \ncare less for a prestigious central address, or those who would like to break away from the media \nestablishment (Leslie 1997; Grabher 2002). \nThe major differences between individual ecologies of FTV firms in London are influenced \nby the specifics of their negotiation and coordination activities (Allen 1999), as well as the \nhistorical conditions of deregulation, contradictory incentives and dependence on foreign \ninvestment, which will be discussed below. As a result of these particularities, decentralization in \nLondon, we argue, happens in a manner that is counter-intuitive. First, it is more prominent for \n                                                \ncentrifugal force of higher rents and congestion, and the centripetal force of\nmilieu in close proximity to the\nspecificity of the \u2018project\u2019 ecology of the overall FTV industry.  However,\nwill be variations in this interplay caused by the non-homogeneous nature of\nthe size of the firm, by the specifics of their operations, and by their ec\nbargaining power. \nThese organizational differences divide FTV firms into two distinctiv\ndecentralization, sustaining spati\ndgets, working on packaged and serialized products (e.g. television program\nstable and long-term relational contracts to major distributors\/broadcas\n \n4 \u2018FTV\u2019 ecology has strong similarities with \u2018advertising\u2019 ecology, see works of G.

The point made by Jarvis and Pratt (2006) was that a large \nproportion of the work in these industries is carried out at home, outside the firm\u2019s boundary, \nwhich may relate to increased distances between work and home and an ability to compensate for \nthis by the use of new technologies. The present article, however, focuses on the extreme situation \nwhere the home becomes a firm, so that the place of work and place of residence are amalgamated \n                                                \nSecond, decentralizing micro companies find their location not in the more urbanized suburban \n\u2018town centres\u2019 of Outer London or sub-centres of more peripheral Inner L\nThe purpose of this article is to show that the FTV industry in th\nlarge number of micro production companies running one project at a time, w\npublic sources.

British film production also failed, in competition \nwith Hollywood, to access the international markets dominated by US majors. The finance of \nproduction companies remains fragmented and often depends on the willingness of US companies \nto invest in British films (co-productions) (Blair and Rainnie 2000). Public funding and other \nprotectionist measures introduced by government, such as the investment of National Lottery funds \ninto film franchises with the purpose of sustaining mini-studios (Baillieu and Goodchild 2002) did \nnot improve the overall situation.

The specifics of \nthe production chain are also important. The FTV production company orchestrates a set of \nfunctions, primarily the development (pre-production) of a film, programme or commercial. This \nstage requires a lot of negotiations about the product itself, as well as about its financing, \ndistribution and conditions of the transfer of the property rights.

The face-\nto-face communications often happen not in the office of the independent production company, but \nin , pubs and \nOther important activities of the FTV firm are also performed mainly outside its own office \nspace.
