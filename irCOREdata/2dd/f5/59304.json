Introduction \n \nModelling systems able to predict the evolution of coastal zones have now become essential to engineering \nand policy making communities. Sediment transport is a key component in coastal interactions, and models \ndescribing the fate of particles and morphodynamics in coastal and estuarine environments have grown into \nvital tools.  \n To be able to correctly reproduce and predict sediment dynamics, the full three-dimensional structure of \nthe flow has to be described in many complex situations, in particular depth-averaged models fail to \nrepresent adequately cases for which buoyancy stratification is significant. Fully three dimensional models \nthat predict suspended sediment concentrations, bed load transport rates, and two-dimensional bathymetric \nevolution, are now being developed. To date, such models (e.g., Lesser et al., 2004; Warner et al., 2008) \ntend to be mostly using C-grids. B-grid models such as the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal \nOcean Modelling System (POLCOMS) (e.g., Holt and James, 2001) are traditionally considered to help \nprevent numerical dispersion of frontal velocity features. \n We will discuss here the implementation of suspended sediment transport, bed load transport and \nmorphodynamical changes within the POLCOMS. Such an effort will provide great capabilities and \nflexibility to the overall modelling system by building on pre-existing synergies. POLCOMS has indeed \nalready been coupled to a wave model (Osuna et al., 2004), the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) \n(Holt and Umlauf, 2008) and an ecosystem model (Allen et al, 2001). In spite of the grid specificity of \nPOLCOMS, the sediment algorithms will incorporate approaches from other similar finite difference \nsediment transport models (e.g., Lesser et al., 2004; Warner et al., 2008). Because of the close interaction \nbetween the hydrodynamics and the sediment dynamics, the new algorithms are implemented directly \nwithin the hydrodynamic model in the POLCOMS.  \nWe will first briefly summarize the existing hydrodynamic model in the POLCOMS, before describing \nin details the sediment transport model.  We will then discuss some aspects of the numerical schemes \nemployed. Finally, we present the comparison of model results with laboratory experimental data of trench \nmigration for which both the velocity and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) vertical profiles and the \nmorphological evolution are well predicted by the sediment transport model implemented in the \nPOLCOMS.   \n                                                          \n1  Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, 6 Bownlow Street, Liverpool, L3 5DA, UK. laou@pol.ac.uk \n2  Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, 6 Bownlow Street, Liverpool, L3 5DA, UK. ajso@pol.ac.uk \n3  Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, 6 Bownlow Street, Liverpool, L3 5DA, UK. jholt@pol.ac.uk \nCoastal Dynamics 2009 \nPaper No.  \n \n2. Model description \n \n2.1. Hydrodynamic model \n \nThe physical model is based on a three-dimensional baroclinic model and solves the incompressible, \nhydrostatic, Boussinesq type shallow water equations of motions. The governing equations can be \nexpressed and solved using either Cartesian or spherical polar coordinates. A time splitting technique is \nemployed to calculate the barotropic and baroclinic components. Following this approach, flow velocities \nare separated into depth averaged and depth varying components. Equations of motions for both the depth \naveraged and depth-varying parts are then derived and solved numerically (see Holt and James (2001) for \nmore details on these equations). The free surface location is obtained following convergence or divergence \nof the water fluxes over the entire water depth and scalars such as temperature and salinity follow a \nclassical advection-diffusion governing equation. \n In the hydrodynamic model, the turbulent stresses and fluxes in the depth varying equations are \nreplaced following respectively the turbulent viscosity and gradient diffusion hypotheses. This results in \ndiffusive terms that necessitate further closure using a turbulence model. Horizontal diffusivities are \nneglected and the vertical diffusivities are obtained either by a one-equation turbulence model or by \ncoupling the hydrodynamic model to the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM, see www.gotm.net). \nWhen coupling POLCOMS with GOTM, several turbulence models are available and the Canuto et al. \n(2001) model is selected by default in the present study. This turbulence closure can be seen as a k-\u03b5 model \nfor which the stability function (i.e., the C\u03bc constant) results from an Algebraic Reynolds Stress Model \nunder the boundary layer assumption. The Prandtl number is neither specified as a constant nor follows \nempirical relationships, but is a consequence of the model itself and is a function of the shear and of the \nbuoyancy.  \n \n2.2. Sediment transport model \n \nThe sediment transport model consists of three interconnected modules respectively calculating suspended \nload, bed load, and bed morphodynamics. Even though bed shear stress calculations are also part of the \nhydrodynamic model, the methods used are discussed in this section due to their strong impact on sediment \ntransport. Because of the multiple interactions between the hydrodynamic model and the sediment \nmodules, the three modules have been implemented within the hydrodynamic model.  \n An infinite number of sediment classes can be represented, each of which is described by user-defined \nvalues for the sediment grain diameter D , the dry sediment density s\u03c1 , the critical erosion bed shear \nstress ce\u03c4  and an erodibility constant 0E . The sediment bed consists of a constant user-defined number of \nlayers, each of which is described by spatially and time varying thicknesses, sediment class distributions, \nporosities and ages.  \n \n2.2.1.  Bed shear stress \nBed shear stress predictions are critical to sediment transport formulations. Different algorithms are \nimplemented here depending on the flow conditions. For currents (velocities varying on a time scale much \nlonger than the time step), the bottom shear stress is calculated using a drag coefficient formula based on \nthe near-bed velocity following a rough wall logarithmic profile: \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) 2BBBBBB v+uz\u03b4\n\u03bav,u=G,F 2\n00\n2\n\/ln\n       (1) \n \nwhere BF and BG  are the two components of the bed shear stress, Bu  and Bv the two components of the \nnear bed velocity defined at an elevation 0\u03b4  above the sea bed. 0z is the bed roughness and 0.41=\u03ba  the \nvon Karman constant. \nCoastal Dynamics 2009 \nPaper No.  \n For wave-current interactions, the mean combined m\u03c4 , maximum combined max\u03c4  and wave bed shear \nstresses w\u03c4  are all calculated. The mean combined stress is then projected on the horizontal grid to obtain \nBF and BG used in the hydrodynamic calculations. Both an iterative solution following the model of \nMadsen (1994) and the explicit formulas of Soulsby (1995) are implemented in POLCOMS.  \n The bed roughness can either be fixed as a user defined constant or can be calculated within the \nnumerical model. In the latter case, it is considered to be the sum of the grain roughness, the bed load \nroughness and the roughness due to sub-grid scale bed forms (ripples). The grain roughness is chosen to be \nproportional to the bed surface mean sediment diameter, the bed load roughness follows the formulation of \nWiberg and Rubin (1989) and the bed form roughness is taken to be a function of ripple length and height \n(Grant and Madsen, 1982). The total bed roughness is then given as  \n \n\u03bb\n\u03b7\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\n\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03b1\n2\n50\nmax2\nmax1\n500 \/1\n\/\nr\ncr\ncr\nblg Da\naDz +++=       (2) \n \nwhere the right hand side terms represent respectively the grain roughness, the bed load roughness and the \nbed form roughness. 50D  is the median sediment diameter at the sediment bed (taking into account all \nsediment classes).

The value for r\u03b1 varies in the literature (e.g., \n0.267 from Nielsen, 1992; about 0.92 from Grant and Madsen, 1982) and has thus been left as a user input \nto be chosen within the range indicated in table 1. Finally, the ripple height \u03b7  and the ripple length \u03bb  are \ncalculated from the value of the wave orbital diameter using the Malarkey and Davies (2003) explicit \nimplementation of the Wiberg and Harris (1994) ripple predictor. \n \nTable 1: Summary of coefficients in bed roughness determination. \n \nCoefficient  Value \ng\u03b1  2.5 \/ 30 \nbl\u03b1  0.056 \n1a  0.68 \nr\u03b1  0.1 to 1 \n \n2.2.2.

Deposition is taken \nto occur at all bed shear stresses and erosion is modelled following a linear dependence to an excess shear \nstress: \nCoastal Dynamics 2009 \nPaper No.  \n( ) \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212 1 1 max\nce\n0 \u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c6E=E         (5) \n \nwhere 0E  is the used-defined erodibility constant and \u03c6  is the top bed layer porosity. max\u03c4  is the \ncombined wave-current maximum shear stress and ce\u03c4  is the user-defined critical erosion stress.  \n For each sediment class, the settling velocity is computed from the sediment diameter, the sediment \nspecific gravity and the water kinematic viscosity coefficient following van Rijn (1993): \n \n[ ]\u23aa\u23aa\n\u23aa\n\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23aa\n\u23aa\n\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2265\u2212\n<<\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u2212\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212+\n\u2264<\u2212\n=\nmDgDs\nmDgDs\nD\nmDgDs\nWs\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n1000for)1( 1.1\n1000100for1)1( 01.01 10\n1001for\n 18\n)1(\n2\/1\n2\/1\n2\n3\n2\n  (6) \n \n Both the advective term and the diffusive term are calculated following the same approaches as for \nother scalars (temperature and salinity). Furthermore, the sediment Schmidt number (ratio of the turbulent \neddy viscosity by the sediment turbulent diffusivity) is taken to be identical to the buoyancy Prandtl \nnumber. \n \n2.2.3.  Bed load \nBed load is typically related to the bed shear stresses via non-dimensional equations, in which the non-\ndimensional bed load transport rate is \n \n31)gD(s\u03c1\nQ=\u03a6\ns\nB\nB \u2212 ,        (7) \n \nand the non-dimensional bed shear stresses are \n \n( ) ( )( )gDs= wmwm 1\n,,,, maxmax \u2212\n\u03c4\u03c4\u03c4\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 .

The bed load transport is then projected on to the horizontal grid and a \nmultiplicative factor is applied to account for the local slope effects following Lesser et al. (2004): \n \n( ) \u03b2\u03b2=a m\nm\nsl cos  tantan\ntan\n\u2212\u03d5\n\u03d5\n        (13) \n \nwhere m\u03d5  is the friction angle of sediment and \u03b2  the local bed slope. \n \n2.2.4.  Bed morphology \nThe bed morphology module follows the approaches implemented in Harris and Wiberg (2001) and Warner \net al. (2008). It performs both bed statigraphy (updating the sediment bed structure) and bed morphology \n(updating the location of the sediment bed) procedures.  \n The bed statigraphy first calculates an active layer thickness following Harris and Wiberg (1997): \n ( )[ ] 50max0 D 60  0.007max +,\u03c4\u03c4\u03c1=\u03b4 cea \u2212       (14) \n \nwhere the overbar denotes an average over all sediment classes. The thickness of the top layer is then \nenforced to be at least the active layer thickness. If necessary, the bed statigraphy is rearranged so that (i) \nthe thickness of the top layer is equal to a\u03b4 , (ii) sediment mass is conserved, (iii) the number of bed layers \nis constant.  \n The bed morphology updates both the location of the sediment bed and the top layer thickness \nfollowing the conservation of sediment mass between the bed, erosion, deposition, and bed load transport. \nA morphological factor can be applied to the various sediment fluxes, but total fluxes of sediment out of \nthe bed are limited by the true mass of sediment available in the top layer. The top layer thickness is also \nlimited by a user-defined upper threshold and, if necessary, a new layer is created and the bottom two \nlayers merged.   \n The implementation of the bed morphology separates the top layer thickness calculations from the \nlocation of the sediment bed updating scheme. At each time step, a succession of bed statigraphy, top layer \nthickness calculations and bed statigraphy again is performed in the sediment transport module. The \nlocation of the sediment bed is updated simultaneously with the depth-averaged velocities to enforce \nconservation of fluid mass. Finally, the bottom boundary condition for the vertical velocity is set as the rate \nof change of the sea floor.   \n \n \nCoastal Dynamics 2009 \nPaper No.  \n3. Numerical solution \n \n3.1. Grid \n \nPOLCOMS uses a B-grid in the horizontal plane and a staggered approach for the vertical direction. In the \nhorizontal plane, both velocity components are then defined at u-points, which are the centers of grid cells, \nhalf a grid box to the southwest of b-points, at which all scalars are defined (see figure 1). Sea-land \nboundaries can lie either at b-points or at u-points. In the first case, a free-slip condition is implemented \nwhile in the second case both free-slip or non-slip conditions can be chosen. Open boundaries always lie \nalong b-points. The vertical discretization defines state variables (horizontal velocities and scalars) half a \ngrid above and below the sea surface and sea bottom, while flux variables (e.g., vertical velocity) are \ndefined at the sea bed and at the sea surface. \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Representation of a B-grid. The u-points are located at the plus signs, the b-points (for scalars) are located at \nthe black circles. The diamonds correspond to the location of the translated bed load fluxes. The red symbols \ncorrespond to the middle cell.  \n \n3.2. Numerical schemes \n \nDetails of the numerical schemes for the hydrodynamic model are given in Holt and James (2001) and are \nnot repeated here. A forward time centred space technique is employed to solve the hydrodynamic \ngoverning equations. To prevent the B-grid scale noise, the free surface elevations are filtered following \nKillworth et al. (1991). Advective terms are calculated following a Piecewise Parabolic Method scheme \n(James, 1996) while the diffusive terms are computed following a fully implicit scheme.  \n The \u201csediment module\u201d performs successively bed load calculations, vertical settling with a Piecewise \nParabolic Method scheme, the exchange between the bed and the flow, the bed statigraphy, and finally the \nCoastal Dynamics 2009 \nPaper No.  \nadvection and diffusion. The location of the sea bed is updated within the hydrodynamic model, \nsimultaneously with the depth averaged velocities and free surface location.   \n Sediment variables are mostly defined at b-points (to the exception of the output bed load transport rate, \nbed shear stresses and bed roughnesses). Bed load transport rates are first calculated at the b-points from \nthe interpolated values of the bed shear stress, and are then translated in the horizontal grid to the locations \nrepresented by diamonds in figure 1 to facilitate the bed evolution calculations at b-points which follows \nmass conservation.  \n \n \n4. Model-data comparison on trench migration experiment \n \nWe use the trench migration experiment reported in van Rijn (1987) to test the ability of the model to \nreproduce suspended sediment concentration (SSC) profiles and morphological evolutions. The setup \nconsists of a 30 meter long, and 0.5 m wide straight channel in which a 0.2 m thick bed of well-sorted \nsediment of median diameter 160 \u03bcm is installed. Three different trenches were excavated and their \nmigration downstream was observed after 15 hours. The upstream flow is steady with a depth-averaged \nvelocity of 0.51m\/s and a depth of 0.39 m.  \n The channel is discretised using a 0.1 m resolution in both horizontal directions and 20 constant \u03c3 levels \nvertically. Implementing variable \u03c3 levels was not found to change the numerical solution in the present \ncase. The channel bed slope and a constant bed roughness are determined so that the flow rate remains \nuniform along the test section. Both the flow velocity and suspended concentration are then allowed to \nreach an \u201cinitial\u201d steady state solution. This solution is then used as starting point for the morphodynamic \ncomputation, which employs a morphological factor of 10 due to the small time step enforced. The \nphysical and numerical parameters are summarized in table 1. The critical erosion stress is chosen to be \nabout equal to the critical stress for initiation of motion for the specific sediment used, as estimated from \nthe Shields curve. The erodibility is then chosen based on model-data comparisons of the suspended \nconcentration initial profiles.  \n \nTable 2: Model parameters for trench migration numerical simulations. \n \nModel parameter Value \nMedian sediment diameter 0.16 mm \nSediment dry density 2650 kg\/m3 \nCritical erosion stress 0.00017 m2\/s2 \nErodibility constant 0.012 kg\/m2\/s \nBed porosity 0.4 \nBed roughness 0.0008 m \nBed slope 0.00042 \nUpstream depth averaged velocity 0.51 m\/s \nTime step 0.01 s \nMorphology factor  10 \n \n Model data comparisons for the \u201cinitial\u201d steady state solution and the trench migration are presented in \nfigure 1, where the top panel exhibits the flow velocity and concentration profiles at five locations along \nthe trench and the bottom panel illustrates the trench migration after 15 hours. A numerical simulation \nusing a morphological factor of 1 was performed to verify the lack of impact of this parameter. In spite of \nslight under-predictions of the flow velocity in the excavated trench region, the initial profiles are well \npredicted at the five locations.

The BSS is calculated by \ncomparing the error between the numerical predictions and observations and the error between a baseline \nprediction and the observations. The baseline prediction is often taken to be the initial morphology, and as \nsuch a negative score indicates numerical predictions that would be worse than the initial condition and a \nperfect score is 1. The score for the first trench migration (slope of 1\/3) is found to be 0.94, which is \ntraditionally considered very good. \n In order to further assess the predictive ability of the model rather than its hindcast ability, the \nmigrations of the two other initial trenches (slopes of 1\/7 and 1\/10) were numerically simulated. The \nsediment and flow conditions were the same experimentally and the model should obtain appropriate \npredictions using the same parameters. The results are presented in figure 2. Once again, the predictions are \nreasonable even though the final numerical trenches are found to be a bit deeper than in the experiments. \nThe Brier Skill Score are respectively 0.84 and 0.95 for the 1\/7 and 1\/10 slopes, again confirming the \nreasonable to good predictive ability of the model. \n \nTable 3: Summary of the Brier Skill Score for the three initial configurations. \n \nInitial trench slope Brier Skill Score \n1\/3 0.94 \n1\/7 0.84 \n1\/10 0.95 \n \n \n5. Conclusion \n \nWe are developing sediment transport modelling within the framework of a coastal ocean system, which \ncouples a hydrodynamic model, a wave model and an advanced turbulence model. We showed here how \nsediment transport is being incorporated to the system within the hydrodynamic model. The \nimplementation of the suspended sediment model and of the morphological modelling has been tested \nusing a simple controlled experiment from which both waves and buoyancy are absent. Although the \npresent study is  only a first step towards the full realization of sediment transport predictions in real case \ncoastal ocean scenarios, the model-data comparisons did show that the model can correctly predict \nsuspended sediment transport, and morphodynamical evolutions as shown by the Brier Skill Scores \nobtained and summarized in table 3. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAllen, J, Blackford, J.
