Geographic variation can lead to the evolution of different local varieties\nwithin a given species, therefore influencing its distribution and genetic structure. We\ninvestigated the contribution of plasticity and local adaptation to the performance of a\ncommon aquatic plant (Potamogeton pectinatus) in contrasting climates, using reciprocal\ntransplants at three experimental sites across a latitudinal cline in Europe. Plants from 54\ngenets, originally collected from 14 populations situated within four climatic regions (sub-\narctic, cold temperate, mild temperate, and mediterranean) were grown in three different\nlocalities within three of these regions (cold temperate, Norway; mild temperate, The\nNetherlands; mediterranean, Spain). Tuber production was highest for the mild-temperate\ngenets, irrespective of locality where the genets were grown. Selection coefficients indicated\nthat populations at the European center of the species distribution perform better than all\nother populations, at all sites. However, marginal populations showed changes in life-history\ntraits, such as compressed life cycles in the north and true perenniality in the south, that\nmay allow them to perform better locally, at the limits of their distribution range. Our\nresults thus suggest that local adaptation may overlap spatially with center\u2013periphery gra-\ndients in performance caused by genetic factors (such as genetic drift and inbreeding in\nrange-marginal populations).\nKey words: climate; clonal reproduction; distribution; latitude; local adaptation; plasticity;\nPotamogeton pectinatus; reciprocal transplant; shoot morphology; survival; vegetative growth.\nINTRODUCTION\nCommon plant species with wide distributions may\nperform well in a wide range of environmental condi-\ntions (Joshi et al. 2001). However, the capacity of in-\ndividual genotypes to perform well across the full range\nof conditions is often limited (De Witt et al. 1998). Wide-\nspread terrestrial species are often characterized by both\nphenotypic plasticity and high levels of genetic variation\n(Bradshaw 1984) and by local specialization to partic-\nular environmental conditions (Van Tienderen 1990, Jo-\nshi et al. 2001). In contrast, aquatic plant species, many\nof which are also widespread, have often been shown\nto have limited genetic variation, suggesting the com-\nmon occurrence of general-purpose genotypes among\nthem (Barrett et al. 1993, Santamar\u0131\u00b4a 2002). General-\npurpose genotypes are able to maintain a high fitness\nover broad ranges of environmental conditions, through\ncompensatory plastic responses in morphology, physi-\nology, and\/or phenology (adaptive plasticity; Schlicht-\ning 1986, Dudley and Schmitt 1995).\nManuscript received 18 July 2002; revised 14 January 2003;\naccepted 20 January 2003.

E-mail: viealsg0@uib.es\nOne of the main sources of environmental variation,\nparticularly at continental scales, is climate. This is\nreflected in worldwide vegetation zones, which follow\nthe latitudinal pattern of prevailing environmental con-\nditions (e.g., Walter 1973); and in global patterns of\nplant distribution, which are largely explained by spe-\ncies-specific responses to temperature and precipitation\n(e.g., Woodward and Williams 1987, Woodward 1990).\nSolar irradiance and temperature decrease with increas-\ning latitude, while summer photoperiod increases.\nSince these variables are known to influence many as-\npects of plant life (Berry and Raison 1981, Bjo\u00a8rkman\n1981, Salisbury 1981), widely distributed plant species\nmay be expected to show phenotypic variability across\nlatitude. Genetically based latitudinal variation in phe-\nnology (Potvin 1986, Weber and Schmid 1998), growth\n(Chapin and Chapin 1981, Sawada et al. 1994, Li et\nal. 1998), and sexual reproduction (Aizen and Wood-\ncock 1992, Winn and Gross 1993) has been reported\namong terrestrial species. In general, ecotypes origi-\nnating from higher latitudes show relatively small stat-\nures, early flowering, and decreased fecundity due to\nlower growth rates or short developmental cycles\n(Chapin and Chapin 1981, Potvin 1986, Winn and\nGross 1993, Li et al. 1998). In the context of aquatic\nplants, while some information is available for sea-\nSeptember 2003 2455PLANT PERFORMANCE ACROSS LATITUDE\ngrasses (Philipps et al. 1983) and marine macroalgae\n(Orfanidis and Breeman 1999), latitudinal adaptations\nin freshwater angiosperms have received little atten-\ntion. Because the latter are among the most widely\ndistributed plants (Santamar\u0131\u00b4a 2002) and represent a\nkey component of shallow and littoral aquatic ecosys-\ntems (Carpenter and Lodge 1986), we wanted to de-\ntermine the extent to which their broad distributions\nare related to local specialization of populations from\ndifferent climatic regions.\nThe contribution of environmental and genetic var-\niation to phenotypic variability and performance can\nbe assessed using reciprocal-transplant experiments,\nwhere significant home vs. away differentials are as-\nsumed to reflect local adaptation (e.g., Joshi et al.\n2001). Reciprocal transplants have typically been per-\nformed over small scales and with terrestrial species\n(Bradshaw 1984, Schmid 1985, Linhart and Grant\n1996), often revealing the existence of local adaptation\n(e.g., McGraw and Antonovics 1983, Nagy and Rice\n1997). Population differentiation in morphological and\nphysiological traits has also been reported for a few\naquatic species, typically involving laboratory exper-\niments rather than outdoor transplants (e.g., Koch and\nDawes 1991, Barrett et al. 1993). Recently, Joshi et al.\n(2001) extended the replant\u2013transplant approach to a\nEuropean scale, aiming to correlate the difference in\nhome vs. away phenotypic performance with climatic\ndistances between sites. They found the overall per-\nformance of three grassland species to decline with\nincreasing transplanting distance, being highest for\nhome replants (Joshi et al. 2001). However, climatic\ndistance was not correlated with selection indices and\nonly accounted for 18% of the variation related to geo-\ngraphic distance, suggesting that the observed pattern\nof variation could be caused by factors other than cli-\nmate (such as biotic influences). Since Joshi et al.\n(2001) performed their experiment directly in local\nfield sites, they were not able to evaluate the contri-\nbution of local (e.g., edaphic or biotic) conditions vs.\nclimatic environmental variation to the observed pat-\nterns of local specialization. In this study, we attempted\nto minimize local variation by standardizing most of\nthe environmental variables, e.g., soil characteristics\nand water chemistry, that are not related to climatic\nconditions, i.e., temperature, irradiance, and photope-\nriod. Furthermore, we attempted to evaluate the relative\ncontribution of plasticity to the observed patterns of\nphenotypic variation and to remove the influence of\nenvironmentally induced maternal effects (Rossiter\n1998) by multiplying all sampled genotypes under stan-\ndardized conditions during a complete growing season\nprior to transplanting their clonal propagules to all our\nexperimental sites.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy species\nPotamogeton pectinatus L. (fennel pondweed) is a\nsubmerged angiosperm with a pseudoannual life cycle\nand a cosmopolitan distribution (Hulte\u00b4n and Fries\n1986). Plants grow during spring\u2013summer and survive\nthe winter by means of subterranean tubers (specialized\nasexual propagules). Under mild climatic conditions,\nP. pectinatus may grow as a perennial (Yeo 1965).\nAnnual seed production varies greatly and its contri-\nbution to yearly population recruitment is generally\nconsidered to be minimal in temperate regions (e.g.,\nVan Wijk 1989). Instead, seeds might be important for\ndispersal and establishment after disturbances (Van\nWijk 1989). Given the limited importance and reli-\nability of short-term sexual fecundity estimates, we\nconsidered that asexual population growth rate (r), a\nsurrogate of genet survivorship, represents a better fit-\nness correlate than fecundity (see also Crone 2001).\nReciprocal transplant experiment\nIn summer\u2013autumn 1998 and spring 1999, tubers\nand\/or rhizome fragments were collected from at least\nfour spaced (.10 m) individuals at each of 14 localities\nin Europe and North Africa, grouped within five dis-\ncrete latitudinal ranges taken to represent different cli-\nmatic regions (Fig. 1, Appendix A). In summer 1999,\nwe grew a single tuber or rhizome fragment from each\nsampled individual, i.e., one putative genet, under out-\ndoor, common-garden conditions in Heteren (The Neth-\nerlands), in order to obtain clonal propagules (tubers).\nThe mediterranean populations failed to produce tubers\nunder such circumstances, since they are probably truly\nperennial; hence we kept the plants growing during the\nfollowing winter in indoor aquaria and utilized rhizome\nfragments as propagules. Growing the plants indoors\nduring the winter was also necessary for a few Swedish\ngenets, due to their low tuber production. For such\ngenets, both tubers (from the previous autumn) and\nrhizome fragments (from living plants) were used as\npropagules in the transplant experiment. Out of five\nclonal fragments collected from Loch Gelly (Scotland),\nonly three clonal lines became established during the\npropagation phase; hence, we were only able to use\nthree genets for this population.\nPotamogeton pectinatus hybridizes with closely re-\nlated species of the subgenus Coleogeton. In northern\nregions (United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,\nand Russia), at least two of the hybrids, viz. P. 3\nsuecicus (P. pectinatus 3 P. filiformis) and P. 3 bott-\nnicus (P. pectinatus 3 P. vaginatus), are very difficult\nto discriminate from P. pectinatus on the basis of mor-\nphological traits (Preston et al. 1998, 1999). For this\nreason, the identity of the collected genets was con-\nfirmed by means of RFLP analysis of nuclear and chlo-\nroplast DNA extracted from freshly grown material,\nfollowing the methods described by King et al. (2001).\nIn addition, ISSR (intersimple sequence repeat) \u2018\u2018fin-\ngerprint\u2019\u2019 data were used to discriminate between dif-\nferent P. pectinatus genets; i.e., to ensure that the pu-\ntative genets selected for the experiment did indeed\nrepresent different genotypes (see Appendix B for de-\n2456 L.

A high proportion of the clones sampled from\none of the Russian populations (Srednii Shar) were\nidentified as hybrids; hence, we were only able to use\nthree P. pectinatus genets for this population.\nFor the transplant experiment (summer 2000), we\ngrew plants from the 54 clonal lines at three distant\nlocalities, situated at different latitudes and having con-\ntrasting climates (Don\u02dcana, southwest Spain; Heteren,\nThe Netherlands; and Oslo, southeast Norway; Fig. 1,\nAppendix A). The provenance of the genets correspond-\ned to the three experimental localities, together with\nScotland (situated between two of the experimental sites;\nFig. 1) and northern Russia (situated in the northern\nrange limit of the species). The design was not fully\nbalanced, owing to the shortage of tubers from a few\ngenets: although we aimed to use five replicates per\ngenet and growing site, a total of 613 plants was finally\ngrown (204 in Norway, 207 in The Netherlands, and\n202 in Spain), corresponding to a factorial combination\nof 3 sites 3 54 genets using an average of 3.8 replicates.\nAt each experimental locality, plants were cultivated un-\nder common-garden conditions (Appendix C).\nPlant propagules were planted in mid-May 2000, by\ninserting them carefully through the first 2 cm of\nwashed aquarium sand into the clay\u2013sand sediment\nmixture. Plants were cultivated until the end of Sep-\ntember, when they were harvested by washing off the\nsediment using pressurized water and a 2-mm sieve. In\nthe laboratory, we measured the length of the longest\nshoot and the number of ramets per plant, and separated\nthe aboveground (shoots) and belowground (roots 1\nrhizomes) fractions to measure their dry mass (after 24\nh at 708C). Tubers were weighed individually (fresh\nmass) and a random subsample was used for dry mass\ndeterminations (as above, N 5 240). Based on this\nsubsample, the dry mass of the remaining tubers was\nestimated from linear regressions relating dry mass to\nfresh mass (separately for each experimental locality\nand region of genet origin; R2 always above 0.95).\nIn pseudoannual plants, asexual rates of population\ngrowth (r) are best estimated as the product of asexual\nfecundity ( fa), calculated here as the average number\nof tubers per genet and recorded separately at each\nexperimental site, and survival probability (p), calcu-\nlated here as the proportion of plants that produced at\nleast one ramet or one viable tuber, for each genet and\nexperimental site. Thus r 5 p 3 fa. We then used r as\na measure of plant performance or fitness, and calcu-\nlated selection coefficients for each genet i relative to\nthe best-performing genet at each particular experi-\nmental site as si 5 1 2 (ri \/rmax). Thus si ranges from 0\n(for the most successful genet at each site) to 1 (in-\ndicating complete selection against a given genet). This\nprocedure may underestimate the performance of pe-\nrennial plants growing in mild climates, since genets\nthat produced no tubers have a si 5 1. For this reason,\nfitness estimates of plants that produced no tubers but\ndid not senesce by the end of the experiments, i.e., the\nmediterranean genets growing in Spain, were also cal-\nculated using asexual rates of population growth based\nSeptember 2003 2457PLANT PERFORMANCE ACROSS LATITUDE\nTABLE 1.

In the site 3 region matrix\n(Table 1), a home effect is represented by values found\non the diagonal in bold and an increasing distance ef-\nfect is reflected by values further away from the di-\nagonal in bold.\nRESULTS\nDuring the experimental period (May\u2013September\n2000), pronounced climatic differences existed be-\ntween the experimental sites in Norway, The Nether-\nlands, and Spain. P. pectinatus genets that were grown\nat higher latitudes experienced lower air and water tem-\nperatures, lower levels of daily irradiance, and longer\nphotoperiods than those grown in the south (Fig. 1).\nEnvironmental (site) and genetic (region, population,\nand genet) effects, as well as their interactions on life-\nhistory characters were statistically significant in most\ncases (Appendix E). Environmentally induced variation\noccurred in all variables measured, reflecting an increase\nin performance with decreasing latitude (Fig. 2). Genetic\neffects occurred mostly at regional level, with almost no\nsignificant differences among populations and few among\ngenets. Most genetic 3 environmental variation was ex-\nplained by region 3 site interactions, with few significant\ninteractions at population and genet levels. Propagule size\nand type had limited effects on plant growth, affecting\nsignificantly only a few variables.\nBiomass yield (total, vegetative, and tubers) increased\nsignificantly when the plants were grown at sites of de-\ncreasing latitude (ANOVA, P , 10210 for all three var-\niables; Fig. 2A and D). Total biomass yield and tuber\nproduction were higher for midlatitude genets (Neth-\nerlands\/England and Scotland) and lower for northern\n(Swedish\/Russian) and southern (Spanish\/Moroccan)\ngenets (ANOVA, factor region, P , 0.001 for both var-\niables). Vegetative biomass followed the same trend,\nexcept for the mediterranean genets grown in Spain,\nwhich had the highest biomass yield observed in the\nexperiment (ANOVA, P , 1028 for region, P 5 0.023\nfor site 3 region, Fig. 2A). Even in their \u2018\u2018native\u2019\u2019 ex-\nperimental site, however, most clonal replicates of the\nmediterranean genets failed to produce tubers (Fig. 2D).\nSwedish genets, and those mediterranean genets that\ntuberized, produced fewer but larger tubers (ANOVA,\nfactor region, P , 0.0006; Fig. 2E and F) and showed\nalso the largest plasticity in tuber size, which was sig-\nnificantly reduced when the plants grew in \u2018\u2018less favor-\nable\u2019\u2019 experimental sites (e.g., in Norway for the Swed-\nish genets) (ANOVA, site 3 region, P , 1029; Fig. 2F).\nShoot length increased with decreasing latitude of or-\nigin, being maximal for the mediterranean genets (AN-\nOVA, factor region, P 5 0.0048). It also tended to de-\ncrease from southern to northern experimental sites\n(ANOVA, P , 1025; Fig. 2C). The relative differences\nin phenotype among experimental sites varied according\nto the region of origin. For the mediterranean genets,\nthere were large differences in shoot length between the\nexperimental site in Norway and those in the Nether-\nlands and Spain, which did not differ significantly from\neach other (Scheffe\u00b4 post hoc tests, P , 1025, P , 1028,\nand P 5 0.99, respectively). For the Russian genets, the\npattern was reversed: large differences occurred between\nthe experimental site in Spain and those in The Neth-\nerlands and Norway, which were not significantly dif-\nferent (Scheffe\u00b4 post hoc tests, P 5 0.037, P 5 0.0001,\nand P 5 0.99, respectively).

Larger symbols indicate populations growing at their home site (i.e., region 5 site). Shown are log-transformed\nmeans 6 1 SE. Means were computed at the covariate\u2019s mean (log10 tuber mass, 0.017; log10 rhizome length, 0.28).\nSwedish genets, differences between sites were more\nhomogeneous; no significant variation in shoot length\nwas detected for the Scottish genets.\nRamet production increased at experimental sites\nfrom north to south (ANOVA, P , 10212; Fig. 2B),\nwhile shoot-to-root ratio tended to be lower at the Nor-\nwegian site (ANOVA, P , 1024; data not shown). Var-\niation among regions of origin was correlated for both\nvariables. Scottish and Dutch\/English genets showed\nthe largest plasticity in ramet production (Fig. 2B) and\nlowest plasticity in shoot-to-root ratio. Russian, Swed-\nish, and mediterranean genets showed larger plasticity\nin shoot-to-root ratio and a narrower plastic range in\nramet production (Fig. 2B).\nSeed production was very low. Only mediterranean\ngenets growing in Spain set fruit (2 out of 16 genets).\nOn average, 14% of all mediterranean plants growing\nin Spain produced seeds.\nPlant survival varied significantly among sites, and\namong the regions and populations where the genets\noriginated (ANOVA, P 5 0.0019, P 5 0.0015, and P\n5 0.023, respectively). However, none of the interac-\ntions with experimental site was significant, i.e., ge-\nnetic and environmental effects on survival were ad-\nSeptember 2003 2459PLANT PERFORMANCE ACROSS LATITUDE\nditive. Survival was significantly lower in Norway than\nin the Netherlands and Spain (P , 0.003, Scheffe\u00b4 post\nhoc tests), which did not differ significantly (P 5 0.44).\nThe mediterranean genets showed a significantly lower\nsurvival than all other genets (P , 1027 for all Scheffe\u00b4\npost hoc comparisons involving the mediterranean gen-\nets), which did not differ significantly among them-\nselves (P . 0.18; data not shown). The type of prop-\nagule from which the plants grew had no significant\neffect on survival. Irrespective of type, propagule size\nwas, on the other hand, positively correlated with sur-\nvival (ANOVA, P 5 0.007 for tubers, P , 1025 for\nrhizomes).\nSelection coefficients varied significantly among sites\nand among the populations where the genets originated\n(ANOVA, P 5 0.0007 and P 5 0.008, respectively) and\nwere significantly affected by the site 3 region inter-\naction (ANOVA, P 5 0.0012). At all experimental sites,\nmidlatitude genets (i.e., those from Scotland and Neth-\nerlands\/England) had the highest fitness, while those\nfrom the mediterranean and Swedish regions had the\nlowest (Table 1 ). Russian genets had intermediate fitness\nin Spain and The Netherlands and higher fitness, though\nnot significantly different from the midlatitude genets,\nin the Norwegian site (Table 1 ).\nDISCUSSION\nOur results show that most P. pectinatus genets can\ngrow and reproduce asexually at distant latitudes. Sub-\narctic and temperate genets grew and produced tubers\nat the three experimental sites (Norway, The Nether-\nlands, and Spain). For all genets, independent of the\nregion and population of origin, biomass yield and tu-\nber production increased when grown at decreasing lat-\nitude. This might suggest that, in Europe, optimal con-\nditions for growth of P. pectinatus are encountered in\nthe mediterranean region. It should be noted, however,\nthat habitat availability in that region is limited by the\nscarcity of permanent waterbodies (since most shallow\nlakes dry up during the summer) or by major fluctu-\nations in water depth (Gafny and Gasith 1999). Hence,\nP. pectinatus is most abundant at middle latitudes in\nEurope (Hulte\u00b4n and Fries 1986), although the potential\nfor clonal growth and multiplication is higher in the\nsouth (see also Yeo 1965).\nTuber production was highest for the midlatitude\ngenets, i.e., those from The Netherlands and the UK\n(52\u2013568 N), irrespective of the experimental site where\nthey were grown. The second component of survivor-\nship, plant survival during the growth season, did not\nvary significantly among nonmediterranean genets. Se-\nlection coefficients thus indicated that populations from\nmiddle latitudes perform better at all sites. Local ad-\naptation seems to play a minor role in the phenotypic\nperformance of these plants. Our results are more in\nagreement with the observation that range-marginal\npopulations show decreased fitness due to genetic pro-\ncesses, such as genetic drift, inbreeding, and low ge-\nnotypic diversity associated with small population size\nand reduced sexual reproduction (Lesica and Allendorf\n1995, Jonas and Geber 1999, Kark 1999, Garc\u0131\u00b4a et al.\n2000, Dorken and Eckert 2001; but see Sagarin and\nGaines 2002). It is noteworthy that a different com-\nponent of asexual fitness, ramet production, shows a\ncomparable pattern of variation among genets.\nHowever, in our high-latitude experimental site\n(Norway), Russian genets showed their maximum fit-\nness, although not significantly higher than the Dutch\nand Scottish genets. For the Russian genets, marginal\nchanges in survival seem to compensate for the de-\ncreased tuber production when growing under the lim-\niting conditions typical of cold-temperate and subarctic\nsites. Our results are consistent with common-garden\nexperiments demonstrating that high-latitude popula-\ntions of P. pectinatus complete their life cycle and\nproduce tubers earlier (Pilon et al. 2002). Compressed\nlife cycles are generally predicted to increase survival\nin the north, where summers are short and the condi-\ntions in late spring and early autumn are unpredictable,\nbut at the cost of reduced plant growth and propagule\nsize when growing in more favorable environments.\nMediterranean genets failed to produce tubers by\nmid-September at the three experimental sites. Al-\nthough they had a biomass yield comparable to all other\ngenets, except the Russian, they had a higher propor-\ntion of nonsenescent biomass and much thicker rhi-\nzomes at harvest. In the temperate and subarctic region,\nsurviving without tubers (i.e., as a perennial) is rarely\npossible owing to the severe winters with their dras-\ntically reduced day lengths, low water temperatures,\nand frequent frost damage in shallow areas; hence,\nmediterranean genets would not be able to establish.\nIn mediterranean climates, on the other hand, with their\nextended spring\u2013autumn growth seasons and mild win-\nters, perenniality and\/or delayed tuberization are likely\nto result in increased competitive ability.\nHence, mediterranean genets seem to be locally\nadapted: owing to their perennial life cycle, they would\nbe unable to become established in temperate to sub-\narctic populations, but they may have a competitive\nadvantage in climates with mild winters. Correlated\nchanges in shoot length, shoot-to-root ratio, and tuber\nsize are consistent with this hypothesis. Shoot length\nincreased with decreasing latitude of origin of the gen-\nets. Early elongation of shoot internodes is a well-\nknown response to shading, and high plasticity in this\ntrait confers an advantage in environments when com-\npetition for light is a significant selection factor (e.g.,\nDudley and Schmitt 1995, Schmitt et al. 1995). In\nsouthern sites, characterized by high population den-\nsities and high biomass standing crop (due to the mild\nwinters and better growth conditions during spring\u2013\nsummer; L. Santamar\u0131\u00b4a, personal observation), this\ntrait will probably confer a competitive advantage to\nthe local genets. Mediterranean genets showed greater\nplasticity in shoot-to-root ratio (a trait also involved in\n2460 L. SANTAMARI\u00b4A ET AL. Ecology, Vol. 84, No. 9\nlight-competition responses) than the midlatitude gen-\nets, and they produced larger tubers, which are known\nto confer a competitive advantage in dense populations\n(Spencer and Ksander 1995). It is however remarkable\nthat the Swedish genets showed a similar pattern of\nvariation. Until more information becomes available\non the relative contribution of tuber size and shoot-to-\nroot allocation to competition and plant survival under\ndifferent climatic regimes, it is difficult to interpret\nthese traits more accurately.\nOur data thus seem to point to two contrasting sit-\nuations. On the one hand, variation in life-history traits\nand fitness estimates suggests that genets originating\nfrom temperate, midlatitude regions have general pur-\npose genotypes that are able to grow optimally at very\ndistant latitudes. On the other hand, range limit pop-\nulations show changes in their life history (compressed\nlife cycles in the north, true perenniality in the south)\nthat may allow them to perform better locally. This\ndiscrepancy may be caused by limitations in the du-\nration of our experiment, which does not allow for\nlong-term estimates of fitness (over several clonal gen-\nerations) that would take into account variable life his-\ntories among different genets. Alternatively, we may\nbe looking at the spatial overlap of two different pro-\ncesses. Local adaptation may be constrained, but still\narise among populations showing center-periphery gra-\ndients in plant performance due to genetic effects (as\ndescribed previously). Under such circumstances, the\nlikelihood of finding observable effects reflecting local\nadaptation, i.e., home vs. away advantages, will be\nhighest in experimental manipulations over large geo-\ngraphic areas and strong environmental gradients, par-\nticularly those covering the full gradient between both\ndistributional range limits in broadly distributed spe-\ncies (as we did here).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThanks are due to C.M.
