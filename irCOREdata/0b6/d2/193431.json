Following the initial light-perception event, the phytochromes initiate a signal-transduction\nprocess that eventually results in alterations in cellular behavior, including gene expression. Here we describe\nthe molecular cloning and functional characterization of Arabidopsis FHY1. FHY1 encodes a product (FHY1)\nthat specifically transduces signals downstream of the far-red (FR) light-responsive phytochrome A (PHYA)\nphotoreceptor. We show that FHY1 is a novel light-regulated protein that accumulates in dark (D)-grown but\nnot in FR-grown hypocotyl cells. In addition, FHY1 transcript levels are regulated by light, and by the product\nof FHY3, another gene implicated in FR signaling. These observations indicate that FHY1 function is both\nFR-signal transducing and FR-signal regulated, suggesting a negative feedback regulation of FHY1 function.\nSeedlings homozygous for loss-of-function fhy1 alleles are partially blind to FR, whereas seedlings\noverexpressing FHY1 exhibit increased responses to FR, but not to white (WL) or red (R) light. The increased\nFR-responses conferred by overexpression of FHY1 are abolished in a PHYA-deficient mutant background,\nshowing that FHY1 requires a signal from PHYA for function, and cannot modulate growth independently of\nPHYA.\n[Key Words: Arabidopsis; phytochrome; FHY1; FHY3; far-red light; signal transduction]\nReceived April 11, 2001; revised version accepted September 13, 2001.\nLight controls the growth of plants through a network of\nphotoreceptors (Kendrick and Kronenberg 1994). These\nphotoreceptors display distinct photosensory and physi-\nological properties, with growth responses to different\nlight wavelengths being attributable to different indi-\nvidual photoreceptors (Kendrick and Kronenberg 1994;\nQuail et al. 1995). The phytochromes are a small family\nof red (R)\/far-red (FR)-absorbing plant photoreceptors, the\nbest understood of which are phytochrome A (PHYA)\nand phytochrome B (PHYB). The phytochromes exist in\ntwo distinct but interconvertible forms, R-absorbing PR\nand FR-absorbing PFR, and conversion from PR to PFR\ninitiates phytochrome signaling (Quail et al. 1995).\nRecent studies have resulted in several important ad-\nvances in our understanding of phytochrome function.\nFirst, it has become clear that photoconversion of cyto-\nplasmic PR to PFR causes translocation of phytochrome\ninto the nucleus (Sakamoto and Nagatani 1996; Kircher\net al. 1999; Yamaguchi et al. 1999). Thus, activation of\nphytochrome signaling brings phytochrome into the vi-\ncinity of the genes that it regulates. Second, PFR interacts\nwith transcriptional regulators such as PIF3 (Ni et al.\n1998, 1999; Halliday et al. 1999; Mart\u00ednez-Garcia et al.\n2000; Zhu et al. 2000). Together, these advances have\nresulted in an emerging general model for phytochrome\naction, whereby phytochromes perceive light, enter the\nnucleus, interact with transcriptional regulators, and\nthus activate gene transcription (Mart\u00ednez-Garcia et al.\n2000). Other studies have also identified important cy-\ntoplasmic events in phytochrome signaling, events that\npossibly influence the nuclear localization of phyto-\nchrome (Choi et al. 1999; Fankhauser et al. 1999).\nThe phytochromes are differentially responsive to\nlight of different wavelengths. For example, in laboratory\nconditions, Arabidopsis PHYA is uniquely responsible\nfor the response of seedlings to continuous FR (cFR) (De-\nhesh et al. 1993; Whitelam et al. 1993; Quail et al. 1995).\nPHYA-deficient mutant seedlings are completely blind\nto cFR, and exhibit the etiolated phenotypes character-\nistic of wild-type seedlings grown in continuous dark\n(cD) (Dehesh et al. 1993; Whitelam et al. 1993). Muta-\ntions in FHY1, FHY3, and other loci confer cFR-specific,\naltered PHYA-signaling phenotypes (Whitelam et al.\n1993; Hoecker et al. 1998, 1999; Soh et al. 1998, 2000;\nHudson et al. 1999; Bolle et al. 2000; B\u00fcche et al. 2000;\nFairchild et al. 2000; Fankhauser and Chory 2000; Hsieh\net al. 2000). Although many of these loci are cloned, the\nfunctional relationships between the proteins that they\nencode and PHYA are largely unknown.\n3Present address: DEVM\/LMC, Bat.178, CEA cadarache, 13108 St-Paul-\nlez-Durance cedex, France.\n4Corresponding author.\nE-MAIL nicholas.harberd@bbsrc.ac.uk; FAX 44-1603-450025.\nArticle and publication are at http:\/\/www.genesdev.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1101\/\ngad.205401.\n2980 GENES & DEVELOPMENT 15:2980\u20132990 \u00a9 2001 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 0890-9369\/01 $5.00; www.genesdev.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on September 3, 2013 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nHere we describe the cloning and characterization of\nFHY1. We show that FHY1 transcript levels are regu-\nlated by light, and by the product of FHY3. This is\nthe first demonstration of a functional relationship be-\ntween two independent FR-signaling loci. Studies us-\ning FHY1\u2013GFP fusion proteins show that FHY1 is found\nin both nucleus and cytoplasm and that its abundance\nis influenced by light. We also show that overexpres-\nsion of FHY1 specifically enhances PHYA signaling.\nPlants overexpressing FHY1 exhibit enhanced responses\nto cFR, but not to continuous red (cR) or continuous\nwhite (cWL) light. Furthermore, the enhanced FR re-\nsponses exhibited by FHY1-overexpressing plants are\nabolished in the absence of functional PHYA, thus show-\ning that FHY1 does not itself have intrinsic growth-\nmodulating activity but is involved in the transduction\nof the PHYA signal in the regulation of downstream FR\nresponses.\nResults\nMap-based cloning of FHY1\nWe cloned FHY1 using a map-based approach (Fig. 1A;\nMaterials and Methods). FHY1 was mapped to the bot-\ntom of chromosome 2, between markers ve017 and\nDET2 (Li et al. 1996; Zachgo et al. 1996). Further recom-\nbinant mapping using markers from yeast and bacterial\nartificial chromosome (YAC and BAC) clones located\nFHY1 on BAC F16C5 (see Materials and Methods). The\nFHY1 genomic region was sequenced (GenBank acces-\nsion no. AC004684) and contains several putative open\nreading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 1A). A contig of cosmids cov-\nering ORFs 9\u201316 did not complement the fhy1-1mutant\n(data not shown). In addition, a single telomeric chromo-\nsome breakpoint was detected using an ORF-21-derived\nRFLP marker, thus excluding ORFs 22\u201324 from being\nFHY1. We therefore sequenced ORFs 17\u201321 from the\nFigure 1. Molecular cloning of FHY1. (A) Genetic and\nphysical map of part of chromosome 2 containing\nFHY1. FHY1 was mapped using 714 (rec. 1) and 1708\n(rec. 2) chromosomes that were recombinant between\nFHY1 and the markers cop1-6 and nga168, respectively.\nWe positioned FHY1 on a contig of YACs and BACs (see\nMaterials and Methods) and identified a mutation in\nthe sequence of ORF 18 in the fhy1-1 mutant. The\nstructure of FHY1 is shown (thin line, introns; thick\nline, ORF; filled thick line, noncoding 5\u0001 and 3\u0001 tran-\nscribed sequence) with the position of the fhy1-1 mu-\ntation. FHY1 corresponds roughly to, but differs sub-\nstantially from, the last part of the ORF 18 originally\nidentified by the genefinder program.

Molecular analysis using an FHY1\nprobe detected an altered restriction fragment pattern in\nfhy1-2 genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). Further analysis of fhy1-2\nrevealed that this mutation is caused by an inversion of\nan \u223c550-kb DNA fragment from chromosome 2. This\ninversion interrupts FHY1 and disrupts the FHY1 ORF\n(data not shown). In addition, FHY1 transcripts were de-\ntected in FHY1, at reduced level in fhy1-1 plants, but not\nin fhy1-2 plants (Fig. 1C). These observations suggest\nthat fhy1-2 is a loss-of-function allele of FHY1. Further-\nmore, because the FR-response phenotypes conferred by\nfhy1-1 and fhy1-2 are indistinguishable (data not shown),\nit is likely that fhy1-1 (which potentially encodes a pre-\nmaturely truncated protein; see below) is also a loss-of-\nfunction allele of FHY1. Final proof that the gene tenta-\ntively identified as FHY1 is indeed FHY1 was obtained\nvia genetic complementation. When grown in cFR, the\nfhy1-2 mutant displays an elongated hypocotyl and un-\nexpanded cotyledons (Fig. 1D). A 2.1-kb genomic frag-\nment, spanning 795 bp upstream to 304 bp downstream\nof the FHY1 coding sequence, fully complemented fhy1-\n2, conferring a phenotype resembling that of the wild-\ntype control (short hypocotyl and expanded cotyledons\nin cFR; Fig. 1D).\nFHY1 encodes a predicted polypeptide (FHY1) of 23 kD\n(202 amino acids) that is rich in serine and glutamic acid\nresidues (Fig. 2A). FHY1 has no obvious overall similar-\nity to any protein of known function, and contains pu-\ntative nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and nuclear\nexport sequence (NES) domains (Fig. 2A; Nigg 1997).\nfhy1-1 lacks a single adenine residue 671 bp downstream\nof the FHY1 start codon, resulting in a premature STOP\ncodon (Fig. 2A). Database searches revealed the existence\nof a second Arabidopsis ORF that encodes a predicted\nprotein that is related in sequence to FHY1, together\nwith FHY1-related ESTs from soybean and tomato (data\nnot shown). Interestingly, FHY1 contains a region of\nshared homology with part of the PHYA PAS-A domain\n(Fig. 2B; Quail et al. 1995). The biological significance of\nthis shared homology is unknown, because it does not\noverlap with the region of the PAS domain that is con-\nserved in PAS-domain proteins involved in a variety of\nroles from photoperception to circadian clock function\n(Heintzen et al. 2001).\nFHY1 expression is regulated by light and by FHY3\nIt seemed likely that seedling FHY1 levels are related to\nmorphogenesis in cFR, for the fhy1-1 loss-of-function al-\nlele confers a cFR-specific elongated hypocotyl pheno-\ntype (Whitelam et al. 1993). We addressed this possibility\nin two ways. First, we investigated the environmental\nand genetic factors that regulate FHY1 gene expression.\nSecond, we studied the effect of increased expression of\nFHY1 on morphogenesis in cFR (see below).\nWe examined FHY1 mRNA levels in seedlings grown\nin cD and in various light conditions: cWL, cR, and cFR\n(Fig. 3A). In wild-type seedlings, FHY1 mRNA levels ac-\ncumulated to higher levels in cD than in any light con-\ndition, suggesting that light negatively regulates FHY1\ngene expression. In cFR, but not in cWL or cR, FHY1\ntranscript levels were higher in PHYA-deficient phyA-\n201 seedlings than in wild-type seedlings (Fig. 3A).\nFigure 2. FHY1 sequence.

This\nresponse was not observed in phyA-201 seedlings (Fig.\n3B), and is therefore PHYA-dependent. This rapid PHYA-\ndependent down-regulation of FHY1 mRNA levels indi-\ncates the existence of a negative feedback loop, whereby\nPHYA influences the abundance of FHY1 transcripts,\nand possibly of FHY1 itself (see below).\nLike the fhy1-1 and fhy3-2 single mutants, the fhy1-1\nfhy3-2 double mutant displayed a reduced cFR response\n(Fig. 3C). However, the cFR-grown fhy1-1 fhy3-2 hypo-\ncotyl was only slightly longer than that of fhy1-1 (in both\nstandard and nonsaturating cFR conditions; Fig. 3C; data\nnot shown), and a strongly synergistic, cFR-blind pheno-\ntype was not observed. This observation suggests that\nFHY1 and FHY3 may act in the same pathway, and that,\nin addition to the FHY1\u2013FHY3 pathway, additional path-\nways may mediate the cFR response. Alternatively,\nFHY1 and FHY3 may act in separate pathways. We in-\nvestigated FHY1 mRNA levels in fhy3-2 seedlings (Fig.\n3A). In all conditions, fhy3-2 seedlings accumulated less\nFHY1 transcript than did wild-type seedlings, showing\nthat FHY3 positively regulates FHY1 mRNA levels, and\nsuggesting that FHY1 acts downstream of FHY3. Fur-\nthermore, fhy3-2 seedlings still exhibited light-depen-\ndent reductions in FHY1mRNA levels (Fig. 3A), suggest-\ning that these reductions are not FHY3-dependent.\nBecause cFR and FHY3 have opposite effects on FHY1\ntranscript levels, FHY1 expression in a phyA-201 fhy3-2\ndouble mutant was investigated. In cFR, FHY1 mRNA\nlevels in phyA-201 fhy3-2 were intermediate between\nthose of phyA-201 and fhy3-2, and were similar to those\nof wild type (Fig. 3A). This suggests that PHYA and\nFHY3 regulate FHY1 transcript levels independently of\neach other.\nIncreased FHY1 expression specifically enhances\nthe cFR response\nThe above observations on FHY1 expression present a\nparadox: reductions in FHY1 function (in fhy1 loss-of-\nfunction mutants) reduce the cFR response, but apparent\nreductions in FHY1 function (via reduced FHY1 tran-\nscript levels) are also part of the cFR response. To resolve\nthis paradox we investigated the consequences of in-\ncreasing FHY1 expression (in a way that was not subject\nto down-regulation by light). fhy1-2 plants that ex-\npressed FHY1 under the control of the CaMV 35S pro-\nmoter had elevated FHY1 transcript levels in cD, cWL,\nand cFR (Fig. 4A). These plants exhibited an enhanced\ncFR response, being more deetiolated in cFR than wild-\ntype plants (Fig. 4B,C). Therefore, overexpression of\nFHY1 enhances the FR response above that of wild-type\nplants. To determine if this effect was FR-specific, plants\noverexpressing FHY1 were also grown in cD, cR, and\ncWL (Fig. 4C,D,E, respectively). In all cases, FHY1-over-\nexpressing plants were indistinguishable from wild-type\ncontrols, thereby showing that the effect of FHY1 over-\nexpression is light-dependent and FR-specific. Further-\nmore, these observations suggest that the paradox out-\nlined above can be resolved if FHY1 function is (in nor-\nmal plants) subject to negative feedback regulation via\nPHYA at the transcriptional level (as shown above).\nFHY1 requires a signal from PHYA to effect a cFR\nresponse\nWe investigated the effect of FHY1 overexpression in the\nPHYA-deficient phyA-201 mutant. As shown in Figure\n5A, phyA-201 plants containing the 35S::FHY1 construct\nare blind to cFR, and indistinguishable from control\nphyA-201 plants. To confirm that these plants were ex-\npressing the 35S::FHY1 construct, RNA gel-blot analysis\nshowed that the phyA-201 35S::FHY1 line accumulated\nFHY1 transcripts to levels comparable with that seen in\nthe control 35S::FHY1 line (Fig. 5B). Therefore, overex-\npression of FHY1 causes enhanced cFR responses in the\npresence (Fig. 4B,C), but not in the absence (Fig. 5A), of\nPHYA. FHY1 cannot influence growth in the absence of\na signal from PHYA, suggesting that the enhanced FR\nresponses of plants overexpressing FHY1 (in the presence\nof PHYA) are attributable to a FHY1 overexpression-de-\npendent enhancement of the PHYA signal.\nIn further experiments, we investigated the conse-\nquences of FHY1 overexpression in mutant plants con-\ntaining a partially defective PHYA (Fig. 5C).

For example, phyA-3 confers a hypocotyl that is\ntaller than wild type, but shorter than that conferred by\nthe phyA-201 null allele in high-intensity cFR (Hi-cFR),\nindicating that PHYA-3 function is reduced compared\nwith that of PHYA (Fig. 5C). In low-intensity cFR (Lo-\ncFR), the phyA-3 and phyA-201 hypocotyls are of a more\nsimilar length (Fig. 5C). When the 35S:FHY1 construct\nwas introduced into phyA-3, it partially suppressed the\ncFR phenotype of phyA-3. In Hi-cFR conditions, the\nphyA-3 35S::FHY1 line (043) had shorter hypocotyls than\nthe phyA-3 controls, an effect that was less apparent in\nLo-cFR (Fig. 5C). These effects are cFR-dependent, be-\ncause, when grown in cD, these lines were fully etiolated\n(data not shown). Furthermore, the 35S::FHY1 construct\nalso suppressed the phenotype of phyA-4 (data not\nshown), indicating that FHY1 overexpression suppresses\nthe general effects of a reduced PHYA signal, rather than\nany specific effects of the individual mutant PHYA alle-\nles. These observations suggest that overexpression of\nFHY1 enhances responses to a reduced PHYA signal.\nFHY1\u2013GFP fusion proteins can be detected\nin the hypocotyl cells of etiolated plants\nThe intracellular localization of FHY1 was investigated\nusing plants containing a transgene construct that ex-\npressed a FHY1\u2013GFP fusion protein under the control of\nthe FHY1 promoter. Preliminary experiments showed\nthat this construct complemented the fhy1-2 phenotype,\nthus showing that the FHY1\u2013GFP fusion protein has\nFHY1 function (data not shown).\nFluorescence microscopy was used to determine the\nintracellular location of the FHY1\u2013GFP fusion protein.\nAs shown in Figure 6, strong fluorescence was observed\nin the nuclei of the hypocotyl cells of cD-grown FHY1\u2013\nGFP-expressing plants, but not in hypocotyl nuclei of\ncFR-grown FHY1\u2013GFP-expressing plants, or of cD- or\ncFR-grown control (nontransgenic) plants. In addition, as\nshown in Figure 7A, weak fluorescence was also ob-\nserved in the cytoplasm of the hypocotyl cells of cD-\ngrown FHY1\u2013GFP-expressing plants. This fluorescence\nFigure 4.

These ex-\nperiments showed that the nuclear fluorescence attrib-\nuted to FHY1\u2013GFP was still detectable 2 h after transfer\nto cFR. In addition, there appeared to be a slight increase\nin cytoplasmic fluorescence following 2 h of cFR. How-\never, the fact that clear nuclear fluorescence was re-\ntained following the 2-h cFR treatment suggests that\nnuclear FHY1\u2013GFP is not rapidly relocalized or de-\nstroyed following transfer of hypocotyls from cD to cFR.\nAdditional experiments showed that fluorescence due to\nFHY1\u2013GFP in seedlings first grown in cD is reduced by\nsubsequent light treatments of longer duration. We ob-\nserved that 24 h of cFR was needed to reduce the fluo-\nrescence to almost undetectable levels (data not shown).\nInterestingly, treatments with cB, cR, or cWL resulted in\na more rapid loss, with fluorescence essentially disap-\npearing between 4 and 12 h of the onset of exposure (data\nnot shown).\nDiscussion\nPhytochrome action involves light-dependent nuclear\ntargeting, light-dependent phosphorylation of one or\nmore signaling component substrates, and the regulation\nof nuclear gene expression via transcription factors\n(Quail et al. 1995; Ni et al. 1998, 1999; Yeh and Lagarias\n1998; Choi et al. 1999; Fankhauser et al. 1999; Halliday\net al. 1999; Kircher et al. 1999; Yamaguchi et al. 1999;\nMart\u00ednez-Garcia et al. 2000). In addition, there is evi-\ndence suggesting the involvement of GTP-binding pro-\nteins, cGMP, and Ca2+\/calmodulin (CaM) in phyto-\nchrome signaling (Neuhaus et al. 1993; Bowler et al.\n1994). Although PHYA likely operates via these general\nmechanisms, there is clear evidence for the existence of\nadditional components, some of them nuclear, that ap-\npear to be more specific for PHYA signaling (Hoecker et\nal. 1999; Hudson et al. 1999; Bolle et al. 2000; Fairchild et\nal. 2000; Hsieh et al. 2000; Soh et al. 2000). In this paper\nwe describe the isolation and characterization of FHY1, a\ngene encoding the PHYA-specific signaling component\nFHY1. Previous experiments indicated that FHY1 links\nPHYA to gene activation via a cGMP-dependent path-\nway (Barnes et al. 1996), or that FHY1 functions within a\nPHYA signaling pathway that involves a G\u0001 subunit\n(Okamoto et al. 2001). Here we have shown that FHY1\ntranscript levels are regulated by light and by the product\nof FHY3, another gene involved in FR-signaling\n(Whitelam et al. 1993). We have also shown that overex-\npression of FHY1 confers an exaggerated response to cFR,\nand unaltered responses to cD, cR, and cWL. This, to-\ngether with the observation that loss-of-function fhy1\nalleles confer a FR-specific phenotype (Whitelam et al.\n1993), shows that FHY1 function is specifically related\nto FR-signaling. Furthermore, we have shown that over-\nexpression of FHY1 confers increased responses to cFR\nonly in the presence of functional PHYA, thus confirm-\ning that FHY1 acts in PHYA-signaling and has no intrin-\nsic effect in promoting FR responses.\nFHY1 presumably operates within the context of the\naction of other FR-specific signaling components, such\nas those encoded by the FHY3, SPA1, PAT1, FIN2, FAR1,\nFIN219, HFR1, and REP1 loci (Whitelam et al. 1993; Soh\net al. 1998; Hoecker et al. 1998, 1999; Hudson et al. 1999;\nBolle et al. 2000; Fairchild et al. 2000; Hsieh et al. 2000;\nSoh et al. 2000). Some of these components have been\nidentified and partially characterized, and it is instruc-\ntive to attempt to draw together these various observa-\ntions to provide an overall view of how PHYA-signaling\nworks. As outlined above, PHYA exists in the PR form in\nthe cytoplasm and, upon conversion to PFR, becomes lo-\ncalized in the nucleus. Two of the above loci, PAT1 and\nFIN219, encode products that appear to be cytoplasmi-\ncally localized (Bolle et al. 2000; Hsieh et al. 2000). Per-\nhaps PAT1 and FIN219 are involved with cytoplasmic\nstages of PHYA-signaling, or with the targeting of the\nPFR form of PHYA to the nucleus. All of the other FR-\nsignaling loci cloned to date appear to encode nuclear\nfactors: SPA1 is a nuclear WD-repeat protein that acts as\na negative regulator of FR-signaling (Hoecker et al. 1999),\nFAR1 is a novel nuclear protein of unknown function\nthat appears to be a positive regulator of FR-signaling\n(Hudson et al. 1999), and HFR1 (also known as REP1) is\na positive regulator of FR-signaling and a member of the\nbasic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix (bHLH) family of DNA-binding\nFigure 7. Nuclear FHY1\u2013GFP is not rap-\nidly relocalized or destroyed following\ntransfer of hypocotyls from cD to light. (A)\nGFP fluorescence is clearly detectable in\nhypocotyl nuclei and cytoplasm of cD-\ngrown 3-day-old 133 and 35S::GFP seed-\nlings, but not in WT seedlings. (B) Com-\npared with 3-day-old cD-grown 133 seed-\nlings (cD + 2 h cD), GFP fluorescence is\nstill detectable in the hypocotyl nuclei of\ncD-grown 133 seedlings transferred into\ncFR for 2 h (cD + 2 h cFR). Bar, 100 \u00b5m.\nDesnos et al.\n2986 GENES & DEVELOPMENT\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on September 3, 2013 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nproteins (Fairchild et al. 2000; Soh et al. 2000). FHY1, as\nshown here, is a novel protein that can exist in both\nnucleus and cytoplasm and that acts as a positive regu-\nlator of FR-signaling. Presumably the various nuclear\nfactors act together with PHYA within complexes that\nregulate the transcription of PHYA-regulated genes. Be-\ncause some mutants, such as the hfr1 and fhy1 mutants\n(Whitelam et al. 1993; Johnson et al. 1994; Barnes et al.\n1996; Fairchild et al. 2000), affect subsets of the full FR\nresponse, it seems possible that individual components\nmay target the regulation of defined subsets of PHYA-\nregulated genes. In addition, it might be that FHY1 func-\ntion partially overlaps with that of the FHY1-related\ngene also found in the Arabidopsis genome, and that\nloss-of-function alleles at both loci are required to com-\npletely abolish FR responses.\nWe have shown that FHY1\u2013GFP accumulates pre-\ndominantly in the nucleus (but is also detectable in the\ncytoplasm) in cD-grown seedlings, is not found in light-\ngrown seedlings, and disappears with relatively slow ki-\nnetics from seedlings moved from cD into the light. At\npresent we do not know how these different nucleocy-\ntoplasmic distributions relate to FHY1 function. How-\never, FHY1 behavior follows a pattern observed with sev-\neral light-signaling proteins including phytochrome A,\nCOP1, and HY5 (von Arnim and Deng 1994; Kircher et\nal. 1999; Osterlund et al. 2000), whereby light-dependent\ndifferential stability and\/or light-dependent differential\nsubcellular localization are important components of\nfunction.\nAlthough several different factors have been identified\nas FR-signaling components, there is little information\nconcerning how these factors interact with each other,\nwith PHYA, or within the context of information from\nphotoreceptors other than PHYA itself. Here, we have\ndescribed the results of initial experiments that investi-\ngate the effects of some of these factors on the expression\nof FHY1. First, we have shown that FHY1 expression (at\nthe level of transcript accumulation) is down-regulated\nby light. PHYA is clearly involved in this process, sug-\ngesting negative-feedback regulation of FR-signaling by\ncFR via PHYA. However, additional photoreceptors are\nalso involved. Regulation of FHY1mRNA levels by pho-\ntoreceptors other than PHYA may reflect a point of in-\nteraction between the signal-transduction pathways as-\nsociated with these different photoreceptors and the\nPHYA signal-transduction pathway. Intriguingly, the\nFHY1 promoter contains a G-box consensus sequence\nsimilar to that bound by PIF3 (Mart\u00ednez-Garcia et al.\n2000; data not shown), perhaps identifying a site of regu-\nlation by PHYB, PHYA, or other phytochromes.\nThe effect of light on the expression of other FR-sig-\nnaling genes has also been investigated. For example,\nSPA1mRNA levels were increased when dark-grown (D)\nseedlings were transferred to cFR or cR. The effect of cFR\non SPA1 transcript levels was PHYA-mediated, whereas\nthe effect of cR was mediated by PHYA, PHYB, and ad-\nditional phytochromes (Hoecker et al. 1999). Therefore,\nthere are clear parallels between the regulation of FHY1\nand SPA1 expression. Both genes display PHYA-medi-\nated cFR regulation of their respective transcript levels,\nand cR regulates the transcript levels of both genes via\nphytochromes additional to PHYA. Furthermore, it is\ninteresting to note that cFR promotes the accumulation\nof SPA1 transcripts (which encode a negative regulator of\nFR-signaling) and reduces the accumulation of FHY1\ntranscripts (which encode a positive regulator of FR-sig-\nnaling). However, this pattern does not hold for all FR-\nsignaling genes, because the levels of FAR1 transcripts\n(which encode a positive regulator of FR-signaling) are\nunaffected by light (Hudson et al. 1999) and levels of\nHFR1 transcripts (which also encode a positive regulator\nof FR-signaling) are actually increased by cFR (Fairchild\net al. 2000).\nFHY1 expression is also regulated, in a light-indepen-\ndent fashion, by the FHY3 gene product. This result is\nsignificant because it shows, for the first time, a clear\nrelationship between the function of different genes in-\nvolved in regulating FR-signaling. Further work is\nneeded to determine the precise relationships among\nPHYA, FHY1, and FHY3. It is possible that FHY1 and\nFHY3 act in the same pathway. However, the FR pheno-\ntype conferred by fhy3 mutants is different from that\nconferred by fhy1 mutants (Fig. 3C). Therefore, it is un-\nlikely that regulation of FHY1 transcript levels is the\nsole FR-related function of FHY3. Alternatively, FHY3\ncould regulate FHY1 transcript levels independently of\nPHYA-signaling, but additionally be part of a PHYA-sig-\nnaling pathway that involves PHYA, FHY1, and FHY3.\nIn addition, recent evidence suggests that FHY1 and\nFHY3 may operate within separate signaling pathways\n(Okamoto et al. 2001).\nWe have shown that FHY1 is functional only if PHYA\nis also functional. Plants overexpressing FHY1 in the ab-\nsence of functional PHYA do not exhibit the enhanced\nFR responses exhibited by FHY1-overexpressing plants\npossessing normal PHYA function. Therefore, the func-\ntion of FHY1 is clearly associated with the transduction\nof the PHYA signal, and in the absence of a PHYA signal,\nFHY1 has no obvious function. In this respect, FHY1\nfunction is similar to that of SPA1, because the pheno-\ntype of spa1 mutants is dependent on the presence of\nfunctional PHYA (Hoecker et al. 1999). Furthermore, it\nhas been suggested that the spa1 mutations specifically\namplify PHYA-signaling and that the function of SPA1 is\ntherefore to diminish PHYA-signaling (Hoecker et al.\n1999). Here we have shown that overexpression of FHY1\nin partially defective PHYA mutants results in enhance-\nment of the response of plants to the reduced PHYA\nsignals generated by the defective PHYA proteins. Per-\nhaps FHY1 and SPA1 act as counterbalancing amplifying\nand dampening controls on the transmission of the\nPHYA signal in the modulation of FR responses. Intrigu-\ningly, spa1 mutant seedlings are hyperresponsive to cR,\nin a PHYA-dependent fashion (Hoecker et al. 1999), but\n35S::FHY1 seedlings are not (this study; Fig. 4D). These\nobservations indicate that SPA1 does not inhibit PHYA-\nsignaling via FHY1. Alternatively, overexpression of\nFHY1 alone is not sufficient to enhance cR-responsive-\nness.\nFHY1: a PHYA signal transduction component\nGENES & DEVELOPMENT 2987\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on September 3, 2013 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nIn conclusion, our observations suggest that FHY1 ac-\ncumulates in the cells of cD-grown seedlings in prepara-\ntion for light-activated nuclear import of PHYA, and\nthen acts as part of a specific PHYA signal-transduction\nmechanism. FHY1 may achieve this by imposing speci-\nficity\/selectivity on the general transcription factor-me-\ndiated phytochrome gene-activation mechanism, and ap-\npears to act as a specific amplifier of PHYA signaling.\nMaterials and methods\nMutant lines\nThroughout this paper, the wild type is Arabidopsis thaliana\necotype Landsberg erecta. phyA-201, fhy1-1, and fhy3-1 are as\ndescribed (Whitelam et al. 1993; Quail et al. 1994). fhy1-2 and\nfhy3-2 were identified in a fast-neutron mutagenized wild-type\npopulation (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX). phyA-3 and phyA-4\n(named according to Quail et al. 1994) were identified in an\nethyl methane sulfonate-mutagenized wild-type population,\nand contain missense alleles that confer a substantial reduction\nin, but not complete loss of, PHYA function (data not shown).\nAll putative double-mutant homozygotes were test-crossed to\nboth parents to confirm their genotypes.\nMolecular cloning of FHY1\nMapping populations were generated by crossing fhy1-1 (Land-\nsberg erecta background) with wild type or cop1-6 (Columbia\nbackground). DNA from fhy1-1 homozygote F2 or F3 plants was\nanalyzed with cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS;\nKonieczny and Ausubel 1993) and simple sequence length poly-\nmorphism (SSLP; Bell and Ecker 1994) markers. FHY1 (FHY1\nsequence has been deposited in GenBank, accession no.\nAF432142).was mapped to the bottom of chromosome 2, with\n714 and 1708 recombinant chromosomes identified between\nFHY1 and the markers cop1-6 and nga168, respectively. We de-\nsigned a CAPS marker with the gene DET2 (Li et al. 1996; Gen-\nBank accession no. U53860) (DdeI cleavage of a PCR product\namplified with primers 5\u0001-AAATCCAATACCGGCCCAA\nGACCA-3\u0001 and 5\u0001-AAATCCAATACCGGCCCAAGACCA-3\u0001).\nAnalysis of the recombinant chromosomes enabled us to place\nFHY1 between the markers ve017 and DET2. With these two\nmarkers and published data (Li et al. 1996; Zachgo et al. 1996),\nwe constructed a new yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) map of\nthe region. Total yeast DNA from the selected CIC YACs\n(Creusot et al. 1995) and yUP (Ecker 1990) clones was extracted\naccording to Gibson and Somerville (1992). The YAC-ends\nCIC10E10-R, CIC5G4-L, CIC5G4-R, and yUP2C12-L were iso-\nlated by inverse PCR for the right end or by plasmid rescue for\nthe left end (Gibson and Somerville 1992) and converted into\nRFLP markers. Nylon filters spotted with the IGF (Mozo et al.\n1998a,b) and TAMU (Choi et al. 1996) bacterial artificial chro-\nmosome (BAC) libraries of Arabidopsis Col0 genomic DNA\nwere screened with the 32P-labeled yUP2C12-L marker. The\nrelative positions of the BACs were determined by using BAC-\nend derived markers isolated as described (http:\/\/www.tigr.org\/\ntdb\/at\/atgenome\/atgenome.html), a BamHI subclone of the\nBAC F16C5 (B4-1), a PCR product of the ACT1 gene (which\ncorresponds to ORF 12 in Fig. 1; amplified with primers 5\u0001-\nTGTAGCGCTTTTGTGTCCTTATGG-3\u0001 and 5\u0001-CGGCTT\nGAGAAATGGTCGGA-3\u0001), and the yUP6B10-R fragment.\nAnalysis of the cop1-6\/fhy1-1 recombinants showed that B4-1,\nan RFLP marker derived from BAC F16C5, mapped centromeric\nto FHY1, thus showing that F16C5 covers FHY1.\nThe CD4-14 \u0002ZapII cDNA library (Kieber et al. 1993) was\nscreened with a fragment of the second exon of FHY1 (PCR-\namplified with primers 18-9R, 5\u0001-TCACATGATCATAAG\nTAGTAGTAAA-3\u0001; and 18-5F, 5\u0001-CCAGAGGACAGAACAAA\nCTTAGCA-3\u0001). Fourteen positive clones were isolated from\n\u223c8.5 \u00d7 105 pfu, of which 11 were sequenced. These cDNAs rep-\nresented a single gene (FHY1). Total RNA was extracted from\ncD-grown wild-type seedlings, and 5\u0001-RACE (Frohman et al.\n1988) was performed using the Marathon kit (Stratagene) and\nprimer 18-5F. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T easy\nvector (Promega), and two clones were sequenced. The FHY1\ntranscript contains an in-frame STOP codon upstream of the\nfirst ATG, suggesting that the FHY1 ORF (Fig. 1) represents the\ncomplete FHY1 protein.\nFor molecular complementation with constructs containing\nFHY1, plant transformations were as described (Clough and\nBent 1998).\nDNA sequencing was performed using the Big Dye terminator\ncycle sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer).\nTranscript analysis\nTotal RNA was separated on denaturing gels and transferred\nonto Hybond-NX (Amersham). An 18-5F\/18-9R PCR fragment\nwas cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and used to\nmake an [\u0001-32P]UTP-labeled RNA probe (Riboprobe systems,\nPromega). The ribosomal control was as in Deng et al. (1991).\nPlant growth and light conditions\nIn vitro seedling growth medium was as described in Estelle and\nSomerville (1987), but without sugar. For FR, light sources were\nFL20S.FR74 bulbs (Toshiba), output filtered through black\nplexiglass (A.S.H Filters Ltd, UK); for R, FL20SS.BRN\/18 bulbs\n(Toshiba, Japan), output filtered through Fire-red filter (Lee Fil-\nters, UK), intensity 3 W\/m2; for WL, as described in Whitelam et\nal. (1993). Light intensities were measured with a Li-Cor model\nLI-185-B radiometer with a Li-Cor pyranometer probe.\nTransgenic lines overexpressing FHY1\nA PCR product, amplified from a subclone of BAC F16C5 using\nprimers 18-19R (5\u0001-AAGATCTATGCCTGAAGTGGAAGTG-\n3\u0001; containing a BglII site) and 18-8F (5\u0001-CAGGGATACTCTT\nGAACA-3\u0001), was cloned in the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega),\nisolated as a BglII\/SacI fragment, and inserted behind the CaMV\n35S promoter in a BamHI\/SacI opened pBIN121 derivative vec-\ntor. The construct was introduced into fhy1-2, phyA-3, and\nphyA-4 mutants. Transformants were kanamycin-selected, and\nthe progeny were tested in cFR. Transformants grown in cD\nwere indistinguishable from untransformed controls. A phyA-4\ntransformant was crossed with phyA-201; F2 and F3 progeny of\nthis cross were screened for plants homozygous for both the\nphyA-201 mutation and the transgene.\nTransgenic lines expressing FHY1\u2013GFP\nThe FHY1 gene and 795 bp of upstream sequence were amplified\nby PCR from a genomic DNA clone, inserted upstream of, and\nin frame with, the GFP4 coding sequence in a pBIN121 deriva-\ntive vector, and then transformed into fhy1-2. Seedlings (prog-\neny of primary transformants) were examined under UV light\nwith a Leica DMRXA microscope equipped with filter A (Leica)\nand filter XF115 (Omega Optical) for GFP and DAPI (4\u0001,6-diami-\ndino-2-phenylindole) fluorescence, respectively.
