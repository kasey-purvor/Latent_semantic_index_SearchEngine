INTRODUCTION\nJust over ten years ago the European Court of Human Rights issued the\nground-breaking judgment in Aydin v Turkey.1 For the first time, it recognized\nthat an act of rape could constitute torture. This progressive judgment was\nhailed across the international community for its acknowledgement of the\nurgent need to develop legal mechanisms, particularly human rights norms, to\nbring perpetrators of sexual violence to justice. Further, its reinforcement of\nState liability for acts of rape was to have ramifications both within the\njurisprudence of the European Convention on Human Rights and beyond.\nIndeed, not long after the judgment in Aydin v Turkey, the International\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) issued its landmark judgment in\nProsecutor v Akayesu finding responsibility for genocide and war crimes\n* Professor of Law, Durham Law School, DurhamUniversity. clare.mcglynn@durham.ac.uk.

In recent years, however, the \u2018torture debates\u2019 have gener-\nally focused on the validity of torture itself, predominantly in the context of\ngrowing national security concerns and the so-called \u2018war on terror\u2019, leaving\nthe boundaries and outer limits of the Aydin v Turkey ruling on the appli-\ncability of torture protections to rape unclear.3 In relation to the specific of-\nfence of rape, debate has tended to centre on the implications of Convention\njurisprudence for substantive definitions of rape and criminal justice pro-\ncesses, most recently following the judgment inMC v Bulgaria, again leaving\nthe scope of the torture prohibition largely unresolved.4 This latter focus of\nattention is justified on the basis that to address the prevalence of rape, inad-\nequate investigations and low conviction rates, it is crucial to ensure that states\nmeet their positive obligations. Nonetheless, the scope of the torture prohib-\nition remains significant on a general level, in view of the rhetorical and\npolitical impact of findings of torture, as well as for the individual, with the\npossibility of higher damages.\nAccordingly, the aim of this article is to review the legacy of Aydin v Turkey\nby analyzing the Convention\u2019s torture provisions, specifically in relation to the\noffence of rape. Having outlined Aydin v Turkey and its immediate impact\nin section II below, section III considers whether any or all rapes satisfy the\nminimum level of severity to come within the scope of the Convention\u2019s\nArticle 3 protection of inhuman or degrading treatment, followed by an\nanalysis of the torture threshold of severe harm. Section IV examines the\n\u2018purposive\u2019 requirement for torture, with particular reference to debates on\nwhether rapes, and other forms of sexual violence, automatically satisfy this\nelement on the basis of their discriminatory intent. The responsibility of the\nState for rape, and particularly the attribution of responsibility where there is\napparent consent or acquiescence, is considered in section V. Finally, section\nVI concludes that there are grounds for hoping that the European Court may\n2 Prosecutor v Akayesu, Case no ICTR-96-4-T, 2 September 1998.\n3 See, for example, the Special Issue on Torture in (2006) 2 EHRLR, the Special Issue \u2018Law\nas Cruelty: Torture as an International Crime\u2019 (2008) 6 Journal of International Criminal Justice\n157 and the debates surrounding attempts by the UK, and other governments, to review the\nCourt\u2019s absolute protection from deportation to face torture or ill-treatment established in Chahal\nv UK (1997) 23 EHRR 413 and reiterated again in Saadi v Italy (Judgment) (37201\/06) (28\nFebruary 2008).\n4 MC v Bulgaria [2003] ECHR 646.

This is not to suggest\nthat Article 3, or the Court\u2019s jurisprudence, is ideal or adequate. Indeed,\nfeminist critique has established the gendered nature of torture prohibitions\ninternationally and has generated compelling agendas for the wholesale reform\nand re-imagining of torture prohibitions and human rights generally, in order\nto better protect women, particularly, from sexual violence.5 In contrast to\nsuch fundamental and ultimately reconstructive approaches, this article con-\ncentrates on analysing and seeking re-interpretation of the existing definition\nand jurisprudence on rape and torture. In doing so, it provides a clear example\nof the ways in which States\u2019 human rights obligations are changing and\ndeveloping, towards greater responsibility for harms caused by private indi-\nviduals. Andrew Clapham suggests that this \u2018rethinking\u2019 of the human rights\nobligations of States particularly demands that we \u2018reconfigure traditional\napproaches to violence against women\u2019 and this article attempts to suggest\nways of doing so.6 The ambition is that if we expand the boundaries of\nArticle 3, we may better ensure justice for victims of rape.7\nII. AYDIN V TURKEY: BREAKING NEW GROUND\nIn Aydin v Turkey a 17-year-old woman was raped by a member of the Turkish\nsecurity forces. Sukran Aydin had been taken into custody, ostensibly as part\nof a security operation, to gain information from her and other members of her\nfamily about supposed terrorist activities or sympathies. Her forcible deten-\ntion lasted three days, during which time she was repeatedly beaten, sprayed\nwith water whilst naked and, when blindfolded, raped. This was the first time\nthat Aydin had had sexual intercourse and, following her experiences, she\nsuffered long-term psychological after-effects. Just two years after its first\never finding of torture,8 the Court was asked to consider whether her treat-\nment, including the rape, amounted to torture under Article 3 of the European\nConvention which provides that: \u2018No one shall be subjected to torture or to\ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u2019 The Court held that:\nRape of a detainee by an official of the State must be considered to be an\nespecially grave and abhorrent form of ill-treatment given the ease with which\nthe offender can exploit the vulnerability and weakened resistance of his victim.\nFurthermore, rape leaves deep psychological scars on the victim which do not\n5 See A Edwards, \u2018The \u201cFeminizing\u201d of Torture under International Human Rights Law\u2019\n(2006) 19 Leiden J of Intl L 349 and citations therein.\n6 A Clapham, Human Rights Obligations of Non-State Actors (OUP, Oxford, 2006) 1.\n7 While this analysis focuses on rape, it has implications for all forms of sexual violence.\n8 Aksoy v Turkey [1996] ECHR 68.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 567\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nrespond to the passage of time as quickly as other forms of physical and mental\nviolence. The applicant also experienced the acute physical pain of forced pen-\netration, which must have left her feeling debased and violated both physically\nand emotionally.9\nThe Court continued that, as well as the harm of the rape, the other treatment\nshe suffered amounted to a \u2018series of particularly terrifying and humiliating\nexperiences\u2019, especially having regard to her \u2018sex and youth and the circum-\nstances in which she was held\u2019.10 Moreover, the suffering inflicted upon her\nby the security forces was \u2018for a purpose\u2019, namely to elicit information.11\nAgainst this background, the Court found that:\nThe accumulation of acts of physical and mental violence inflicted on the ap-\nplicant and the especially cruel act of rape to which she was subjected amount to\ntorture in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. Indeed the Court would have\nreached this conclusion on either of these grounds taken separately.12\nThis was a remarkable and progressive decision. A finding that the rape, in\nand of itself, was sufficient to constitute torture, marked a very clear departure\nfrom the previous approach of the European Commission in Cyprus v Turkey\nwhich had dismissed the suggestion of torture despite evidence of mass rape\nby security forces.13 But the context had changed. Aydin v Turkey was handed\ndown at a time when public consciousness about the prevalence and egregious\nnature of rape in conflict zones had been heightened, especially in Europe with\nthe conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Nonetheless, the Court\u2019s judgment did\npresage those of the international tribunals established to deal with the con-\nflicts in Yugoslavia and Rwanda and their epoch-making judgments regarding\ngendered violence. The Court must therefore be credited for its recognition of\nthe serious and harmful nature of rape, symbolized in the torture finding.\nEven so, there were elements of the judgment which gave cause for con-\ncern. In particular, the Court appeared to emphasise the \u2018sex and youth\u2019 of the\nvictim as particularly important, as well as highlighting that the acts had taken\nplace in State detention and had been perpetrated by a State actor. While this\nwas (and still is) the paradigmatic approach to constituting torture, it also\nraised the prospect of rendering the impact of Aydin v Turkey little more than\nsymbolic: most rapes are perpetrated by private individuals against other pri-\nvate individuals and not therefore in State detention.\nHowever, in the years following Aydin v Turkey, the Court\u2019s jurisprudence\nhas developed in significant and important ways which have expanded the\nreach of human rights protections beyond paradigmatic examples of state\ncoercion. Most notably in the field of rape, the doctrine of positive obligations\nhas been deployed to great effect to bring to account state failures regarding\nthe investigation and prosecution of previously marginalized forms of rape,\n9 Aydin v Turkey (n 1) para 83. 10 ibid para 84. 11 ibid para 85.\n12 ibid para 86. 13 Cyprus v Turkey (1982) 4 EHRR 482.\n568 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nparticularly acquaintance rapes.14 In this way, the concept of positive ob-\nligations has enabled the Court to hold states liable for breaches of human\nrights in a far greater range of circumstances than had hitherto been the case.15\nMost particularly, it has facilitated a means by which harms by private in-\ndividuals have been held to account, where a failure to take action by the state\nhas, in practice, facilitated the breach. This expanding jurisprudence, bringing\n\u2018non-state actors\u2019 to account for their human rights abuses, is particularly\nsignificant for victims of sexual violence.\nBut this does not necessarily mean that the Convention\u2019s protection of rape,\nand particularly rape as torture, has expanded. Indeed, at the same time that\nthe scope of the concept of positive obligations and the responsibilities of\nnon-state actors has been expanding, the Court has been setting clearer, more\nspecific, and arguably more limiting, criteria necessary for a finding of torture.\nThese developments in torture jurisprudence provide new challenges for those\nseeking to establish rape as torture. It is to these developments, and therefore\nan assessment of the overall impact of Aydin v Turkey on the conceptualiz-\nation of rape as torture, that the following sections now turn.\nIII. RAPE, HARM AND THE TORTURE THRESHOLD\nThere are a number of different criteria which must be established before the\nCourt will determine that a particular act or acts constitute torture, including\nthe \u2018purpose\u2019 of the acts, the level of \u2018state responsibility\u2019 and the status of the\nperpetrator\/s. Preliminary, however, to each of these considerations are the\nthreshold questions of, first, the minimum requirements to fall within Article 3\nand, secondly, the level of harm necessary to establish torture. Not only are\nthese essential pre-conditions for a finding of torture, but they are also funda-\nmental issues which reveal much about how the Court conceptualizes ques-\ntions of harm and human rights, for example its relative insistence on physical\nor psychological harm and its development of Convention jurisprudence\nbeyond the foundational attention on state-centric, public-oriented forms of\nabuse. These threshold questions also raise key concerns for feminist scholars\nand activists as they involve controversial matters of comparability among\nrapes and of appropriate strategies to bring perpetrators to justice. Finally, and\nmost obviously, these threshold issues determine, for an applicant, the ad-\nmissibility of their claim and levels of any damages.\nTurning, therefore, to the first question, namely whether the particular rape,\nor indeed all rapes, satisfy the minimum requirements of Article 3, the Court\nhas stated that for conduct to fall within Article 3, in general, it must \u2018attain\na minimum level of severity\u2019.16 It has further, repeatedly, opined that the\n14 MC v Bulgaria (n 4).\n15 For example, Costello-Roberts [1993] ECHR 16.\n16 Ireland v UK (1979\u201380) 2 EHRR 25 para 162.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 569\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nassessment of this minimum is \u2018relative\u2019 depending on \u2018all the circumstances\nof the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental\neffects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim\u2019.17 In\nthis way, the Court maintains flexibility in the application of Article 3. Its\napproach is conceptual, outlining the broad purpose and scope of the pro-\nvision, rather than providing an exhaustive list of modalities; thereby pro-\nviding flexibility, but also indeterminacy. Once this minimum threshold has\nbeen reached, the Court then considers whether the conduct constitutes tor-\nture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, according to a hierarchy\nof severity, with torture being the most serious, followed by inhuman and then\ndegrading treatment or punishment.18\nIn relation to the offence of rape, it is clear that rape can satisfy the mini-\nmum threshold of severity to come within Article 3. This much has been clear\nsince the 1970s when the applicability of Article 3 to acts of rape was first\nconsidered in the context of the Turkey\u2013Cyprus conflict. In reporting on the\ncomplaints of mass rape of Greek Cypriot women by the Turkish forces,\nthe European Commission found that there was evidence of rape by Turkish\nsoldiers, which were not isolated acts of indiscipline, and that the Turkish\nauthorities had failed to take adequate measures to either prevent the rapes\nor to take subsequent disciplinary action.19 It went on to hold that, as a con-\nsequence, there had been a breach of Article 3, namely that the rapes con-\nstituted \u2018inhuman treatment\u2019.20 For now, the important aspect of this first\ncase is that the rapes under consideration satisfied the minimum level of\nseverity to come within Article 3 which established that rape can come within\nArticle 3. The next question is whether all, and any rape, satisfies the mini-\nmum threshold.\nSince Cyprus v Turkey, a number of cases involving rape have come before\nthe Court, each giving important indications of its approach. In X and Y v\nthe Netherlands the Court held that the failure of Dutch law to proscribe the\nsexual violence of mentally disabled persons fell within, and breached,\nArticle 8 on the right to private life.21 When faced with a challenge to the\ncriminalization of marital rape under Article 7 of the Convention, the Court\nwas clear in its condemnation of rape, in all forms, referring to the \u2018essentially\ndebasing character of rape\u2019 which it deemed \u2018so manifest\u2019 and, furthermore,\nthat the immunity of husbands was not in conformity with the \u2018fundamental\n17 Moldovan v Romania [2005] ECHR 458 para 100.\n18 For a criticism of this hierarchical, or \u2018vertical\u2019, approach, see Malcolm Evans \u2018Getting to\nGrips with Torture\u2019 (2002) 51 ICLQ 365.\n19 Cyprus v Turkey (n 13) paras 371\u2013374.\n20 There was no finding of torture, despite the evidence of mass rape, often committed with\nextreme violence and the evidence that the rapes were directed against Greek Cypriots, by Turkish\nforces, because of the differences in ethnic origin: Cyprus v Turkey, ibid, discussed in L Zilli, \u2018The\nCrime of Rape in the Case Law of the Strasbourg Institutions\u2019 (2002) 13 Criminal Law Forum\n245, 250\u2013251. 21 X and Y v the Netherlands [1985] ECHR 4.\n570 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nobjectives of the Convention, the very essence of which is respect for human\ndignity and freedom\u2019.22\nSuch cases identify the seriousness with which the offence of rape is\napproached in Convention jurisprudence generally. Specifically in relation to\nArticle 3, in E and others v the UK the Court held that there was \u2018no doubt\u2019\nthat the rape, sexual abuse and violent assaults of a step-father on his young\nstep-children fell within Article 3.23 Nonetheless, the existence of many ag-\ngravating features of this case, the repeated abuse and victimization of young\npeople, do not definitively tell us whether any rape, and therefore all rapes,\nwill come within Article 3.\nPerhaps this debate has been answered by the judgment inMC v Bulgaria.24\nIn this case, the Court held that the failure of Bulgarian law to provide\nthe necessary protection for victims of rape where there was no evidence of\nphysical resistance by the victim, constituted a violation of the positive ob-\nligations of States under Article 3. In particular, it held that states have a\npositive obligation, inherent in Articles 3 and 8, to \u2018enact criminal-law pro-\nvisions effectively punishing rape and to apply them in practice through ef-\nfective investigation and prosecution\u2019.25 This suggests that as a failure in law\nto proscribe all forms of rape violates the positive obligations inherent in\nArticle 3 any rape will constitute ill-treatment of sufficient severity to meet the\nthreshold requirements of Article 3. In particular, the rape at issue in MC v\nBulgaria was of a type often not taken seriously and wrongly assumed to be of\nless harm and consequence than stranger-rapes, namely an \u2018acquaintance\nrape\u2019 involving little physical violence or resistance. That the Court still found\nthat this form of rape requires the protection of Article 3 implies that any rape\nwill satisfy the minimum requirements for Article 3.\nThis is undoubtedly the correct approach, both in terms of the empirical\nevidence of the harm of rape and the seriousness of the wrong of rape in\nviolating the sexual autonomy of individuals. In relation to the harm necessary\nto come within Article 3, it is significant that the Court recognises that what\nconstitutes harm extends far beyond physical injury.26 Many rapes do not\nentail severe physical injury and any that there is may be short-lived. But\nthis does not mean that the rape is not injurious; it is that the wounds are\npsychological. Evidence suggests enduring and serious adverse effects of\nrape, with studies finding, for example, a high rate of post-traumatic stress\ndisorder in rape victims.27 One study of victims concluded that: \u2018Rape is\n22 SW & CR v UK [1995] ECHR 52 para 44.\n23 E v the UK, application no 33218\/96, 26 November 2002, para 89.\n24 MC v Bulgaria (n 4). 25 ibid para 153.\n26 The Court confirmed in Dikme v Turkey that assaults causing mental suffering \u2018may fall\nwithin the scope of Article 3 of the Convention even though they may not necessarily leave\nmedically certifiable physical or psychological scars\u2019: [2000] ECHR 366, para 80.\n27 For a discussion of this research, see J Temkin, Rape and the Legal Process, (2nd edn, OUP,\nOxford, 2002) 2.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 571\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nan experience which shakes the foundations of the lives of the victims. For\nmany its effect is a long-term one, impairing their capacity for personal re-\nlationships, altering their behaviour and values and generating fear\u2019.28 Added\nto this weight of evidence is research establishing that many acquaintance\nrapes can actually be as traumatic, if not more, than the archetypal stranger-\nrape due to the breach of trust by, say, family member, partner, friend or\ncolleague.29 In other words, all rapes, and not just violent, stranger rapes, can\nresult in serious, adverse and long-term consequences for victims.\nWere the European Court to hold that a rape does not satisfy the minimum\nthreshold for the protection of Article 3, it would also be failing to recognize\nthat the seriousness of rape lies in its violation of sexual autonomy, a funda-\nmental value to be protected by human rights norms and instruments.\nEmblematic of this recognition is the statement from the International Crimi-\nnal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) that: \u2018The Trial Chamber\nconsiders the rape of any person to be a despicable act which strikes at the\nvery core of human dignity and physical integrity.\u201930 Accordingly, it seems\nreasonably clear that the Court rightly considers that any rape satisfies the\nminimum threshold for Article 3.\nOn the assumption that all rapes do satisfy the minimum threshold for\nArticle 3, the next and more complex question is which rapes, if not all,\nconstitute torture? To examine this issue, we must turn to the Court\u2019s juris-\nprudence on torture and in particular the threshold issue: the factors which\ndetermine the difference between inhuman and degrading treatment, and\ntorture.\nThe Court initially set the threshold for torture extremely high. In Ireland v\nUK the Court found that the interrogation practices under consideration, such\nas sleep and food deprivation, stress positions and hooding, did not amount to\nconduct sufficiently severe to be deserving of the sobriquet torture.31 Indeed,\nit was not until 1996 that the Court made its first finding of torture in Aksoy\nv Turkey.32 In this case, the Court emphasized the importance of Article 3\nstating that it \u2018enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic\nsociety\u2019.33 It went on to state that the distinction embodied in the Convention\nbetween inhuman and degrading treatment and torture had been included to\nallow the \u2018special stigma of \u201ctorture\u201d to attach only to deliberate inhuman\ntreatment causing very serious and cruel suffering\u2019.34 The treatment in Aksoy,\nincluding \u2018Palestinian hanging\u2019, was said to have caused \u2018severe pain\u2019 which\nwas long lasting and appeared to have been \u2018administered with the aim of\n28 W Young, Rape Study\u2014A Discussion of Law and Practice, (Wellington, New Zealand:\nDepartment of Justice, 1983) 34, discussed in Temkin, ibid 1\u20133.\n29 V Wiehe and A Richards, Intimate Betrayal: Understanding and Responding to the\nTrauma of Acquaintance Rape (London, Sage, 1995).\n30 Prosecutor v Delalic, Judgment, IT-96-21-T, 16 November 1998, para 495.\n31 Ireland v UK (1979\u201380) 2 EHRR 25. 32 Aksoy v Turkey (n 8) para 62.\n33 ibid. 34 ibid para 63.\n572 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nobtaining admissions or information\u2019.35 The Court concluded that \u2018this treat-\nment was of such a serious and cruel nature that it can only be described as\ntorture\u2019.36 Thus, Aksoy v Turkey delivered a clear statement that there is an\nunambiguous distinction between conduct which constitutes inhuman or de-\ngrading treatment and that which comes within \u2018torture\u2019.37\nApplying Aksoy v Turkey, the question becomes, is rape of such a \u2018serious\nand cruel nature that it can only be described as torture\u2019? The answer of the\nICTY is \u2018obviously\u2019.38 To explain more fully, it has stated that: \u2018[S]ome acts\nestablish per se the suffering of those upon whom they are inflicted. Rape is\nobviously such an act.\u201939 Consequently, [\u2018s]evere pain or suffering, as re-\nquired by the definition of the crime of torture, can . . . be said to be estab-\nlished once rape has been proved\u2019.40 Such an approach has the benefit of\nsimplicity: it always being clear that once rape has been established, the harm\nthreshold for torture has been satisfied. It may obviate intrusive questioning of\nvictims regarding the impact of the rape and its adverse effects. It may also\nensure that the egregious nature of rape is better recognized, being assimilated\nwith torture. For these reasons and more, it is an approach widely rec-\nommended by many feminist scholars.\nCatharine MacKinnon, for example, has written powerfully of the violence\nwhich women suffer in the form of rape, asking \u2018why is torture on the basis of\nsex\u2014for example, in the form of rape, battering, and pornography\u2014not seen as\na violation of human rights?\u201941 She castigates the international community for\nfailing to see violence against women as sufficiently serious and political to\nconstitute torture and advocates a reconceptualization of rape as torture.42 Her\nargument, followed by many others,43 is that characterizing rape as torture\nwould both acknowledge the serious harm that is rape, as well as drawing on the\n\u2018recognized profile\u201944 of torture internationally, garnering national and inter-\nnational recognition of the egregious nature of all violence against women.\n35 ibid para 64. 36 ibid.\n37 The Court did highlight other factors, such as the purpose of the treatment, namely for\n\u2018obtaining admissions or information\u2019: Aksoy v Turkey (n 8) para 64. Further, the status of the\nperpetrators was also likely to prove important, namely that the conduct in question was ad-\nministered by the Turkish security forces in detention. These criteria are discussed further below.\n38 Prosecutor v Kunarac, (IT-96-23&23\/1) Appeals Chamber, 20 June 2002, para 150.\n39 Kunarac, ibid paras 150\u2013151.\n40 ibid.

While for many rape survivors, the rape has\nruined their lives, threatened their livelihood through wrecking their well-\nbeing and destroyed the security and comfort that they took for granted in their\nlives; for others, it is serious, harmful, painful, and they move on.46 Over-\ngeneralizing the trauma of rape, the argument goes, may add to the perception\nof rape as exceptional, as especially dreadful and to be feared: to be a \u2018fate\nworse than death\u2019. Perhaps, Engle asks, \u2018feminist advocates should ask\nwhether rape is really a fate worse than death\u2019.47\nThis approach to differentiating between the harms of rape arguably reflects\nthe fact that most legal systems recognize different forms of rape, para-\ndigmatically child or \u2018statutory\u2019 rape, and take into account the varied con-\ntexts in which rape takes place, impacting for example on the sentencing of\nperpetrators.48 Considering the issue of rape as torture, and to take just one\nexample, rape by a State official may not be very different, from the victim\u2019s\nperspective, from rape by a private individual, but from society\u2019s perspective\nit may be more egregious. The State official is someone who is specifically\nresponsible for upholding the law, someone to whom women should be able to\nturn for protection. Further, the consequences of State involvement may be\nmore pernicious, with the possibility that the investigation, prosecution and\npunishment of the perpetrator may be compromised, if not entirely impeded.\nThus, it may be that from a societal perspective, rape by a State official may be\nan aggravated form of rape, possibly impacting on sentencing and also poss-\nibly aggravating the conduct, bringing it within a threshold of severity for\ntorture.49 In other words, there is an argument that not all rapes should be\ntreated the same as constituting the severe harm necessary for a finding of\ntorture.\nTo return to the discussion about the threshold for torture under Convention\njurisprudence and Aydin v Turkey, it is clear that the Court has not taken the\napproach that rape per se constitutes the severity of harm for torture. Indeed, it\nhas introduced a number of possible features and characteristics which appear\nto be relevant to a determination of the torture threshold including the place\n45 K Engle, \u2018Feminism and its (Dis)Contents: Criminalising Wartime Rape in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina\u2019 (2005) 99 AJIL 778, 813.\n46 Rhonda Copelon makes this argument in respect of survivors of domestic violence, though\nshe still argues that such violence should be recognized as torture: \u2018Intimate Terror:\nUnderstanding Domestic Violence as Torture\u2019, in R Cook (ed) Human Rights of Women: National\nand International Perspectives (Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994) 116.\n47 Engle (n 45) 813. 48 McGlynn (n 42).\n49 For a similar example, see the discussion around the term \u2018genocidal rape\u2019, discussed in\nMcGlynn (n 42) 79\u201380.\n574 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nand circumstances of the rape, the status of the perpetrator and the victim\u2019s sex\nand youth.\nExamining \u2018sex and youth\u2019 first, it is not exactly clear what implications are\nto be gleaned from this part of the judgment. It seems from the way in which\nthe Court dealt first with the rape, then with the other harmful acts, that the\nreference to \u2018sex and youth\u2019 as aggravating factors refers to forms of \u2018terri-\nfying and humiliating\u2019 experiences, other than the rape. It could be, therefore,\nthat the Court considers these criteria relevant to the non-sexual ill-treatment.\nNonetheless, when assessing the severity of treatment, the Court has said that\nthese criteria are relevant and it is, therefore, important to consider what the\nCourt might have meant, in the context of rape.\nIn relation to \u2018youth\u2019, this criterion is a factor emphasizing the vulnerability\nof the individual, both emotionally and physically, and clearly in the Court\u2019s\nview aggravates conduct, bringing it closer to torture. This seems relatively\nstraightforward and ties in with the Court\u2019s repeated references to the need\nto ensure particular protection of \u2018vulnerable\u2019 individuals.50 However, it is not\nimmediately clear what the Court has in mind in relation to \u2018sex\u2019.51 Was the\nCourt making a broader statement that for the victim to endure rape, and\/or the\nother forms of torture inflicted on the victim in Aydin v Turkey, was worse\nas she was female, than had she been male? It would certainly be wrong to\nclass female rape as \u2018worse\u2019 and therefore more harmful than male rape.52\nWere it an argument from chivalry that to inflict pain and torture on a woman\nis somehow worse than on a man, due to social assumptions about the role\nof women, this too would be undesirable. It may be possible to interpret\nthe reference to the victim\u2019s \u2018sex\u2019 as alluding to the psychological impact\nof the rape on a virgin (as Aydin was) in a cultural context in which the loss of\nvirginity, prior to marriage, even through rape, could have serious adverse\nconsequences for a woman\u2019s future marriage prospects.53 Nonetheless, it\nwould be far preferable were the Court\u2019s references to \u2018youth and sex\u2019 to be\ntaken as referring only to the non-sexual forms of ill-treatment,54 indicating\nthat in relation to rape, the victim\u2019s sex (or sexual status) is neither an\n50 This \u2018vulnerability\u2019 is most evident in matters involving children and\/or education. See for\nexample A v UK (1999) 27 EHRR 611, discussed in Clapham (n 6) 373\u2013374.\n51 The ICTR and ICTY have also included \u2018sex\u2019 within their list of variables when con-\nsidering whether torture has occurred. See further C Burchard, \u2018Torture in the Jurisprudence of the\nAd Hoc Tribunals\u2019 (2008) 6 Journal of International Criminal Justice 159, 165.\n52 On the harm of male rape: G Mezey and M King, Male Victims of Sexual Assault (2nd edn,\nOUP, Oxford, 2000) and P Rumney, \u2018Policing Male Rape and Sexual Assault\u2019 (2008) 72 Journal\nof Criminal Law 67.\n53 Similar issues arose in Prosecutor v Delalic where the ICTY Trial Chamber emphasised\nthat in considering whether rape gives rise to pain and suffering, one \u2018must not only look at the\nphysical consequences, but also at the psychological and social consequences of rape\u2019 (n 30) para\n486.\n54 However, even in such circumstances, it is not clear that a distinction on the grounds of\n\u2018sex\u2019 is justifiable.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 575\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\naggravating factor, nor one lowering culpability, although youth may well\naggravate the offence.\nThe other potentially aggravating factor, \u2018rape of a detainee by an official of\nthe State\u2019, is related to key criteria for a finding of torture itself, namely the\nrole of the State. But if we stay for now with considering this as an aggravating\nfactor, which enhances the harm of rape from ill-treatment to torture, there are\na number of issues to consider. The Court seemed to be suggesting that the\nstatus of the perpetrator, here a \u2018State official\u2019, aggravates the offence. A\nrationale for this is not expressed, but might be based on the fact that if the\nperpetrator is an agent of the State, it may make them appear, in the eyes of the\nvictim, to be inviolable and thus a complaint is less likely and resistance may\nappear futile. For example, the very act of reporting the conduct may make the\nvictim vulnerable again to persecution as the agent may well have knowledge\nof the complaint.55 The Court recognized this in Aksoy v Turkey in which it\nstated that the victim\u2019s severe ill-treatment at the hands of State officials\n\u2018would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive\nof the representatives of the State\u2019.56 The ICTY has made a similar argument\nstating that the \u2018condemnation and punishment of rape becomes all the more\nurgent where it is committed by, or at the instigation of, a public official\u2019.57\nArguably, this comes down to a question of trust, or rather abuse of trust, on\nthe basis that we are all entitled to place trust in state officials, whether they\nbe the security forces, the police, prison officers and the like. These are indi-\nviduals who are supposed to act to protect citizens from harm and to act within\nthe rule of law.58 For such persons to breach this trust is an especially grave\nact as it can destroy the ability of the victim to trust any person in authority in\nthe future, leaving that person feeling even more vulnerable and insecure. This\nis recognized in other jurisdictions, for example constituting an aggravating\nfactor in sexual assaults.59 This justification certainly seems plausible in re-\nlation to a State official, but also has clear parallels for other types of rape\nwhich must be made clear.\n55 This argument is put forward in Colin Yeo, \u2018Agents of the State: when is an official of the\nstate an agent of the state?\u2019 (2002) 14 International Journal of Refugee Law 509, 523.\n56 Aksoy (n 8) para 56. 57 Delalic (n 30) para 495.\n58 In Costello-Roberts (n 15) Article 3 was not found to be violated where a step-father hit the\nvictim with a slipper a number of times. On the contrary, in Tryer, application no 5856\/72,\njudgment of 25 April 1978, the treatment of the victim who was \u2018birched\u2019 in the Isle of Man was\nfound to constitute degrading treatment contrary to Article 3. Among the factors distinguishing\nthe two cases, the Court in Tryer emphasized the \u2018institutionalized character\u2019 of the violence as\nbeing significant (para 33). This is akin to the argument being made here regarding the breach of\ntrust where a state official commits the violent acts.\n59 In sentencing guidelines produced in England and Wales in relation to sexual assaults,\nincluding rape, a number of aggravating factors are listed which will increase sentence and these\ninclude the abuse of power and\/or abuse of a position of trust: Sentencing Guidelines Council,\nSexual Offences Act 2003\u2014Definitive Guideline (London, Sentencing Guidelines Council, 2007),\n9\u201310, available at: http:\/\/www.sentencing-guidelines.gov.uk\/docs\/0000_SexualOffencesAct1.pdf\n[accessed 26 May 2008].\n576 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nTo emphasize: it is abuse of trust or abuse of a position of power which\nis the aggravated harm, with abuse by a State official just one form of that\nviolation. In this way, any rape which also involves an abuse of power or\nposition of trust, be it by a partner or former partner, employer, teacher, or\nother private individual, will constitute an aggravating factor. Indeed, it is\narguable that the abuse of trust could be more so in the latter types of case: it\nseems entirely possible that Sukran Aydin placed almost no faith or trust in the\nsecurity forces in Turkey. To underline the point, this aspect of the ruling in\nAydin v Turkey should be interpreted as meaning that it is the abuse of trust or\nposition of power that is the crucial aggravating factor, of which just one\nexample is abuse by a state official.60\nLinked to the harm of rape by a State official, the Court appeared to place\nemphasis on the place of the rape. The Court in Aydin v Turkey referred to\nthe rape of a \u2018detainee\u2019 being especially grave \u2018given the ease with which\nthe offender can exploit the vulnerability and weakened resistance of his\nvictim.\u201961 This suggests that detention is a factor aggravating the treatment,\nmaking it more severe, and more likely to ground a finding of torture.62 But it\nis important to emphasize that while state detention clearly will induce vul-\nnerability in a detainee, it is the vulnerability that should be significant, not the\nsite of the treatment. Therefore, exactly where that conduct takes place should\nnot be over-emphasized. It should further be recognized that the vulnerability\nof detention can be reproduced in many other circumstances, for example in\nthe home of a woman being raped and abused. Thus, it is a victim\u2019s inability\nto escape from the perpetrator, both psychologically and\/or physically,63\nand their consequent fear regarding what will happen, which is significant.\nAccordingly, it is essential that the term \u2018detainee\u2019 in Aydin is not interpreted\nto mean a particular physical place, such as a state detention facility, but\n60 On the contrary, Radacic argues that whether \u2018an individual was raped by a state agent or\nby a private individual should not be relevant in assessing the severity of treatment, as distinct\nfrom establishing the responsibility of the state\u2019 (n 4) 364.\n61 Aydin v Turkey (n 1) para 83.\n62 It is certainly clear since Ilhan v Turkey [2000] ECHR 354 that for treatment to amount to\ntorture it does not have to take place in state detention. In this case, the victim was beaten by\nsecurity forces in a field near to his village, prior to being taken into detention. Thus, while the\ntreatment under examination did not exclusively take place in detention, it was an element of the\ncase and the fact of being taken into detention did confirm state involvement and the vulnerability\nof the victim. So, while the acts do not all need to take place within detention, to presage a finding\nof torture, thus far it has been an element in all torture cases. It would certainly be an arbitrary\ndistinction were the place of the conduct in question to become a criterion for a finding of torture.\nNote that there is no specification regarding the place of the torture in the UN Convention Against\nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984,\nS Treaty Doc No 100-20, 1465 UNTS 85, 114 (entered into force on 26 June 1987) Article 1.\n63 The ICTY recognized in Kunarac, when considering the crime of enslavement, that even\nwhen the women involved had the physical means to leave the house in which they were being\nheld, via keys or the house being left open, in practice this was not a reasonable possibility as they\nhad nowhere else to go and had no place to hide from their persecutors even had they left. They\ntherefore had \u2018no realistic option whatsoever to flee the house\u2019 (n 38) para 742.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 577\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nshould instead denote either a physical place, but not limited to a state facility\nand including therefore the home, or even better a psychological condition\nsuch that the individual considers that they have no means of escape.64\nAs Deborah Blatt has stated, a \u2018woman\u2019s home can become her torture\nchamber\u2019.65\nOne final aspect relating to the severity threshold is that the Court has stated\nthat the acts in question must be \u2018deliberate\u2019.66 This suggests that the conduct\nin question must not be accidental or unintentional.67 This criterion maps onto\nthe United Nations Convention Against Torture\u2019s requirement that acts of\ntorture are \u2018intentional\u2019, which has been interpreted to mean that the acts are\n\u2018consciously and actively occasioned\u2019.68 This part of an inquiry into the nature\nof the conduct should not give rise to any particular problems: an act of sexual\nintercourse can scarcely be accidental or unintentional. Nonetheless, it is un-\nfortunately conceivable that in the context of rape, it may be argued that the\nacts in question were not deliberate, but impulsive, in the \u2018heat of passion\u2019 and\nwere the result of a loss of self-control and therefore not \u2018deliberate\u2019. An\nenduring myth of rape, and of masculine sexuality, is that once unleashed,\nmale libido is an unstoppable force. Such an argument, were it ever to be run,\nshould be dismissed forthwith. All rapes are specific and deliberate acts over\nwhich the perpetrator retains control and the possibility of resistance. Further,\nthere should be no requirement for pre-mediation or planning for acts to still\nbe \u2018deliberate\u2019 and \u2018intended\u2019.69\nIn essence, therefore, I am arguing that the Court in Aydin v Turkey estab-\nlished that an act of rape could satisfy the threshold of harm for torture, but\nimplied that not all rapes will necessarily do so. Exactly which criteria will be\nconsidered by the Court, and how they will be interpreted, is moot, but it\n64 Rhonda Copelon has examined the criterion of state detention for a finding of torture in the\ndomestic violence context and explains the reality that victims of domestic abuse do indeed feel\nimprisoned in their own homes and unable to leave. They are in effect in detention; detention at\nthe hands of their abusers. Women do theoretically have the opportunity to leave, but it is now\ngenerally accepted that this does not conform to the reality of the victim\u2019s experience: Copelon\n(n 46) 138.\n65 D Blatt, \u2018Recognizing Rape as a Method of Torture\u2019 (1991\u20131992) 19 New York University\nReview of Law and Social Change 821, 851. Indeed, Blatt continues that in some circumstances\nof rape, such as mass rape, the \u2018intimidation of a populace is most effectively accomplished when\nofficials rape women in their homes because family members often witness the attack and share\nthe feelings of degradation and powerlessness\u2019 851. 66 Aksoy (n 8) para 63.\n67 For a discussion of this requirement in international criminal law, see Burchard (n 51).\n68 As discussed in E Smith, \u2018A Legal Analysis of Rape as Torture: Article 3 ECHR and the\nTreatment of Rape within the European System\u2019 in Michael Peel (ed) Rape as a Method of\nTorture (Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, Report No 1000340, 2004) 202.\n69 Malcolm Evans discusses the practice of the European Committee for the Prevention of\nTorture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment of Punishment, which reports on the operation of\nArticle 3, to reserve the term \u2018torture\u2019 to describe activities inflicted for a particular purpose and\nwhich have usually required some form of \u2018preparation\u2019, largely in terms of equipment for the\nconduct of torture. Were such an approach to be adopted, in general, to torture it would be\nregrettable as it would preclude acts of sexual violence which generally do not require, though\noften involve, forms of equipment. See Evans (n 18) 374.\n578 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nseems from the above analysis that issues such as the status of the perpetrator,\nthe age and sex of the victim, and the place of the rape may be relevant. I have\nsought to argue that within the confines of this approach, the Court should be\nencouraged to be as flexible as possible in its interpretations, to expand the\nboundaries of Article 3 to ensure that it recognizes the varied ways in which\ntorture is carried out and in which the harms of rape and sexual violence are\nperpetrated. In other words, the Court must strive to move beyond a stereo-\ntypical view of torture, towards an acceptance of its multifaceted nature.\nFurther, it is clear that the Court has not taken the same approach to \u2018rape as\ntorture\u2019 as that of the ICTY, which found that the act of rape per se constitutes\nthe harm of torture. Such an approach does indeed have the benefit of sim-\nplicity and avoids problems of some rapes not being taken as seriously as\nothers. Rhonda Copelon argues that a reason why rape, and other crimes of\nsexual violence, should be mainstreamed into international law, such that rape\nconstitutes torture, is that \u2018history teaches us that there is an almost inevitable\ntendency for crimes that are seen simply or primarily as crimes against women\nto be treated as of secondary importance\u2019.70 This is true. But there is also the\ndanger that if all rapes are subsumed under the term \u2018torture\u2019, such harms\nwould be more easily forgotten and less easily recognized as gender-based,\nwith the attention continuing to be on \u2018real\u2019 torture.71 It may also be that in\ncharacterizing rape as torture, we fail to accept the diversity of experience of\nrape survivors who may not characterize their harms as \u2018severe\u2019 harms, suf-\nficient to ground a torture claim. Kelly Askin has suggested that if we \u2018reverse\nthe stigmas and stereotypes association with sex crimes\u2019, removing the \u2018shame\nand stigma\u2019 from victims, \u2018we take away much of the power held by the per-\npetrators of these crimes\u2019.72 Holding that not all rapes are of extreme severity\nmay go some way towards reducing the stigma and stereotyping associated\nwith the crime.\nTo conclude: my argument is that all rapes should be held to satisfy the\nminimum threshold for Article 3, on the basis that all European societies not\nonly criminalise rape, but also treat it as a crime of particular gravity.\nAccordingly, it is appropriate and necessary to hold that all rapes constitute\ninhuman and\/or degrading treatment. Such a finding is also vital to ensuring\nthat states take greater responsibility, via their positive obligations, to prevent\nrape and convict rapists. However, it does not necessarily follow that all rapes\nper se entail the severe harm necessary for a finding of torture. The severity of\nthe harm is necessarily subjective, varying to an extent from case to case.\nWhile this can have disadvantages, with some victims\u2019 harms not being taken\n70 R Copelon, \u2018Gender Crimes as War Crimes: Integrating Crimes against Women into\nInternational Criminal Law\u2019 (2000\u20132001) 46 McGill Law Journal 217, 234.\n71 See further McGlynn (n 42).\n72 K Askin, \u2018Prosecuting Wartime Rape and Other Gender-Related Crimes under Inter-\nnational Law: Extraordinary Advances, Enduring Obstacles\u2019 (2003) 21 Berkeley Journal of\nInternational Law 288, 347.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 579\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nseriously, whereas a common \u2018standard\u2019 might obviate such intrusions into the\nvictim\u2019s experiences, it also has advantages. It can take into account a victim\u2019s\nperspective and ensure that they are included in the process of assessing and\ndetermining what happened to them. Further, it has a more strategic point.\nThis line of reasoning would mean retaining the label \u2018torture\u2019 for some acts\nwhich different societies hold as especially egregious, for example rape by\nstate officials, as well as maintaining the label \u2018rape\u2019, with its own powerful\nassociations and gendered meaning.\nFurther, I have argued that in considering the different elements which\nmight aggravate rape, bringing it within the realms of torture, the elements\nhighlighted by the Court in Aydin v Turkey should be broadly interpreted so as\nnot to privilege specific forms of rape, by specific perpetrators, in specific\nphysical contexts. Thus, the immediate imperative is to ensure that in deter-\nmining severity, the Court does not rely on common myths and assumptions\nabout rape. The Court should abide by its ruling in Selmouni which specifi-\ncally endorsed a flexible approach to torture by stating that \u2018[c]ertain acts\nwhich were classified in the past as \u201cinhuman and degrading treatment\u201d as\nopposed to \u201ctorture\u201d could be classified differently in the future\u2019.73 The Court\nso held on the basis that the \u2018increasingly high standard being required in the\narea of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspond-\ningly and inevitably requires greater firmness in assessing breaches of funda-\nmental values in democratic societies\u2019.74\nIV. THE \u2018PURPOSE\u2019 OF RAPE\nWhile the Court has emphasized the significance of the severity of treatment\nfor it to constitute torture, from the late 1960s and the Greek case, the Court\nhas also highlighted another important aspect to torture, namely its purpose.75\nIn the Greek case, the Court held that \u2018the word \u201ctorture\u201d is often used to\ndescribe inhuman treatment, which has a purpose, such as the obtaining of\ninformation or confessions, or the infliction of punishment, and it is generally\nan aggravated form of inhuman treatment\u2019.76 While this reference to purpose\ndid not initially take on much significance, in recent years it has become clear\nthat it now constitutes an important element to any torture inquiry.77\nIn finding there to have been torture in both Aksoy v Turkey and Aydin v\nTurkey, the Court made reference to the political context of the victims\u2019 de-\ntention and to the political purposes for which they were held, namely the\nextraction of information and intimidation generally.78 In the subsequent\n73 Selmouni v France (2000) 29 EHRR 403, para 101. 74 ibid.\n75 The Greek case, [1969] 12 YB 1. 76 ibid 186.\n77 Indeed Evans argues that the Commission and Court \u2018have never fully subscribed to the\nseverity of suffering approach, despite their mantra-like espousal of it over the years\u2019: (n 18) 373.\n78 In Aydin v Turkey the Court stated that the conduct in question was \u2018for a purpose, which\ncan only be explained on account of the security situation in the region . . . and the need of the\n580 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\ncases of Ilhan v Turkey and Salman v Turkey, the Court made this \u2018purposive\nelement\u2019 an explicit criterion for a finding of torture.79 In doing so, the Court\nreferred to the purposive condition in the UN Convention on Torture.80 The\nUN Convention provides that for the relevant conduct to constitute torture it\nmust be carried out for one of the prohibited purposes which are listed as: \u2018for\nsuch purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a con-\nfession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is\nsuspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third\nperson, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind\u2019.81 While the\nseverity threshold focussed on the victim, the purposive element transfers\nscrutiny to the perpetrator and the circumstances surrounding the conduct or\ntreatment in question.\nThe rape in Aydin v Turkey, therefore, clearly came within a traditional\npurposive approach to torture, being ostensibly for political purposes regard-\ning intimidation, coercion and the extraction of information or a confession.82\nIndeed, in cases such as Aydin v Turkey and Aksoy v Turkey, the Court did not\nundertake an evidential enquiry into whether or not the purpose has been met,\nmaking this assumption as the conduct took place in state custody. But such an\nassumption will not always be made, as was clear in Denizci and others v\nCyprus and Egmez v Cyprus where a link between the ill-treatment and\n\u2018extracting a confession\u2019 had not been established.83 While in both cases the\nallegation of torture was rejected on the lack of evidence of severity of harm,\nthere was also a clear implication that the lack of purpose regarding confes-\nsions was relevant.\nIt is evident, therefore, that the Court\u2019s jurisprudence demands that the\nill-treatment in question is carried out for a prohibited purpose and that, thus\nsecurity forces to elicit information\u2019: (n 1) para 85. These points were made without hearing\nevidence on this particular point. In other words, it was just assumed that this was the reason for\nthe conduct and that this satisfied any insipient \u2018purposive\u2019 criterion. This is also the case in the\nmore recent case of Dikme v Turkey (n 26).\n79 Ilhan v Turkey (n 62) para 85; Salman v Turkey (2002) 34 EHRR 17, para 114. See also\nAkkoc v Turkey (2002) 34 EHRR 51; Mahmut Kaya v Turkey [2000] ECHR 129, para 117.\n80 Ilhan v Turkey ibid; Salman v Turkey ibid. UN Convention Against Torture and Other\nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (n 60), Article 1: \u2018For the purposes of this\nConvention, the term \u201ctorture\u201d means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical\nor mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third\nperson information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or\nis suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any\nreason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the\ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an\nofficial capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental\nto lawful sanctions.\u2019 81 ibid.\n82 Zilli has criticized the reference to the purpose for which Aydin was raped as this ignores\nthe fact that not only was her rape an action of discrimination on the grounds of her ethnicity,\nbeing Kurdish, but also of gender discrimination\u2014she was raped because she was a woman:\n(n 20) 261\u2013262.\n83 Egmez v Cyprus (2002) 34 EHRR 29, para 78 and Denizci and others v Cyprus [2001]\nECHR 351, para 384.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 581\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nfar, the discussion of purpose has been solely linked to the extraction of\nconfessions and information. The question following on from this is whether\nthe purposive element will and should continue to be limited to such a narrow\nrange of circumstances. The UN Convention definition of torture goes beyond\nthis narrow conception, specifically referring to one of the proscribed purposes\nas being \u2018for any reason based on discrimination of any kind\u2019. The Court has\nincreasingly been looking to the UN Convention for guidance in developing\nits jurisprudence and I would argue that it certainly should do so in this area. If\nthe Court were to consider this broader category of purposeful action in the\nUN Convention, the next area for debate is whether the act of rape itself\nconstitutes \u2018discrimination of any kind\u2019? If so, this would mean that the pur-\nposive element of torture is met in every case of rape. There has yet to be any\nruling on this in relation to UN Convention,84 but there has been discussion of\nthis criterion before the ICTY.\nWhen defending himself against the charge of rape as torture, Zoran\nVukovic claimed that even if he had raped the victim, which he denied,\nhe argued that he had committed the act out of a \u2018sexual urge, not out of\nhatred\u2019.85 In so arguing, he was trying to tap into a vein of thought which\nconceives of rape as a desperate act of sexual fulfilment, rather than one of\nviolence and power. Most immediately for him, he was claiming that he did\nnot rape for one of the prohibited purposes required for a finding of torture.\nThe ICTY Trial Chamber rejected this argument, in part, on the basis that the\nprohibited purpose need only be part of the motivation and does not need to be\nthe predominant or sole purpose.86 In holding that part of the motivation may\nbe a \u2018sexual urge\u2019, this ruling suggests that the sexual urge is distinguishable\nfrom any other purposes of rape. It is important for future rulings that it is\nrecognized that while there may be a sexual urge in rape, there is always\nanother element, namely the use of power. Every act of rape is an act of power\nand therefore with purposes beyond sexual gratification.\nFurther dicta from the ICTY confirm this approach. In Prosecutor v Delalic\nthe ICTY Trial Chamber held that \u2018the violence suffered . . . in the form of\nrape, was inflicted upon her by Delalic because she is a woman . . . this re-\npresents a form of discrimination which constitutes a prohibited purpose for\nthe offence of torture\u2019.87 Kelly Askin argues that this \u2018acknowledges that\nfemales are often tortured in ways different than males, and singled out for\ndiscriminatory treatment because of their sex or gender\u2019.88 The import of this\nruling is that all rapes of women will constitute a prohibited purpose as all\nwomen are raped because they are women.89 Similarly, in Kvocka the Trial\n84 Edwards (n 5) 375\u2013376. 85 Kunarac (n 38), para 816.\n86 ibid. 87 Delalic (n 30) para 941. 88 Askin (n 72) 324.\n89 There is some debate as to whether or not this is the definitive conclusion from this case. In\nthe subsequent Kunarac case the Trial Chamber held that rape and torture could be cumulatively\ncharged. Rosalind Dixon has suggested this means, implicitly, that \u2018rape does not inherently\nembody gender discrimination as a constituent mental element\u2019: R Dixon \u2018Rape as a Crime\n582 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nChamber found that \u2018the rape and other forms of sexual violence were com-\nmitted only against non-Serb detainees in the camp and that they were com-\nmitted solely against women, making the crimes discriminatory on multiple\nlevels\u2019.90\nNonetheless, it must be recognized that the ICTY is dealing with inter-\nnational humanitarian law and discussions of the \u2018purposive\u2019 element of the\ndefinition of torture are not, therefore, tethered to state policies or interests.\nThus, it has been argued that the purposive element of torture and the text\n\u2018discrimination of any kind\u2019 needs to be interpreted in the same context as\nother examples of purposes, namely confessions, the extraction of information\nand such like.91 However, it is not clear that this has been definitively deter-\nmined, with others emphasising that the definition of torture contained in\nArticle 1 of the UN Convention does not list the purposes as exhaustive,\nspecifically referring to \u2018such purposes as . . .\u201992\nIf we assume that rape is not a crime of \u2018passion-gone-wrong\u2019,93 and that\n\u2018any other purpose\u2019 may be interpreted more broadly as including gendered\nviolence, then what is it that is the purpose of rape? Catharine MacKinnon\nargues that all rapes are for a purpose\u2014the maintenance of male dominance.94\nThe abuse she says is \u2018neither random nor individual\u2019; it is \u2018systemic and\ngroup-based\u2019 and is \u2018defined by the distribution of power in society\u2019.95 Rape is\nnot an opportunistic, inexplicable crime committed by one aberrant individual\nagainst another. It exists because of, and perpetuates, women\u2019s inequality to\nmen. Charlotte Bunch argues that violence against women is political and the\n\u2018message is domination: stay in your place or be afraid\u2019.96 This argument is\nechoed by Kelly Askin who contends that if \u2018gender were not a factor, grossly\ndisproportionate instances of sexual violence would not be committed against\nin International Humanitarian Law: where to from here?\u2019 (2002) 13 European Journal of\nInternational Law 697, 700, citing paras 443\u2013460 of Kunarac (n 38). However, it could equally be\nthe case that not every rape is torture as the other conditions for a finding of torture are not met. In\nthis light, once the other prerequisites have been satisfied, the purposive burden has also been met.\n90 Prosecutor v Kvocka, ICTY-98-30-T (2 November 2001) para 560.\n91 See the discussion in Edwards (n 5) 375\u2013376 and Smith (n 68) 206.\n92 H Burgers and H Danelius, The United National Convention Against Torture\u2014A Handbook\non the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or\nPunishment (Dordrecht, Martinus Nijhoff, 1988) 118, discussed in Copelon \u2018Recognising the\nEgregrious in the Everyday: Domestic Violence as Torture\u2019 (1994) 25 Columbia Human Rights\nLaw Review 291, 329.\n93 C Niarchos, \u2018Women, War and Rape: challenges facing the ICTY\u2019 (1995) 17 Human\nRights Quarterly 649, 650.\n94 MacKinnon rightly asserts that sexual assault is \u2018best understood as social\u2014attitudinal and\nideological, role-bound and identity-defined\u2014not natural\u2019. In other words, there is no biological\nreason or justification, as such an explanation would not explain female sexual aggressors and\nmale victims, or why many men do not sexually assault others (n 41) 240\u2013241. That rape and\nsexual assault is gender based is also internationally accepted in various instruments including the\nUN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women and the\nCouncil of Europe: MacKinnon (n 41) 241. 95 ibid (n 41) 22.\n96 C Bunch, \u2018Women\u2019s Rights as Human Rights: Towards a Re-vision of Human Rights\u2019\n(1990) 12 Human Rights Quarterly 486, 491.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 583\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nwomen\u2019.97 Thus, sexual violence is gendered in that it is committed, primar-\nily, by men against women and therefore constitutes discrimination. Rhonda\nCopelon argues that rape is \u2018sexualized violence that seeks to destroy a\nwoman based on her identity as a woman\u2019.98 She continues that while men are\nraped, the \u2018humiliation in male rape is accomplished by reducing him to the\nstatus of a woman\u2019. For this reason, she suggests, \u2018rape, whether carried out\nagainst women or men, is a crime of gender\u2019.99 In this way, all acts of sexual\nviolence, including male rape, are gendered and discriminatory and are com-\nmitted for reasons beyond sexual satisfaction.\nThis recognition of rape as a crime of gender with discriminatory intent\nhas found support internationally. In relation to the UN Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Women\u2019s\nCommittee issued a General Recommendation which stated that the \u2018defi-\nnition of discrimination included gender-based violence, that is, violence\ndirected against a woman because she is a woman or that affects women\ndisproportionately\u2019.100 This clearly applies to rape, which predominantly af-\nfects women, and supports the argument that rape is a discriminatory act.\nFurther support can be gained from the UN General Assembly which adopted\na Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women in 1993 which\nmade it clear that violence against women is a \u2018manifestation of historically\nunequal power relationships between men and women\u2019.101 This proposition\nalso has been jurisprudentially recognised, with the Canadian Supreme\nCourt stating in R v Oslin that \u2018[s]exual assault is in the vast majority of cases\ngender based. It . . . constitutes a denial of any concept of equality for\nwomen\u2019.102\nThere is evidence that the European Court of Human Rights understands\nrape and other forms of sexual violence as being part of an overall picture of\ndiscrimination against women. In MC v Bulgaria, when surveying the range\nand purpose of sexual assault laws internationally, the Court referred specifi-\ncally to the Council of Europe\u2019s recommendation on the need to take measures\nto combat violence against women.103 The Council of Europe\u2019s recommen-\ndation affirmed that \u2018violence towards women is the result of an imbalance\nof power between men and women and is leading to serious discrimination\n97 K Askin, \u2018Sexual Violence in Decisions and Indictments of the Yugoslav and Rwandan\nTribunals: Current Status\u2019 (1999) 93 AJIL 97, 103.\n98 R Copelon, \u2018Surfacing Gender: Re-Engraving Crimes Against Women in Humanitarian\nLaw\u2019 (1994) 5 Hastings Women\u2019s Law Journal 243, 246. 99 Copelon ibid.\n100 CEDAW GR No 19: Violence Against Women, UN Doc A\/47\/38 (1992), para 6, discussed\nin Edwards (n 5) 377.

In other words, it is\nessential to recognize that rape does not happen because of unfulfilled sexual\ndesire, nor does it take place in a social and political vacuum. Gendered\nviolence, including rape, takes place because women remain unequal in society\nand because it perpetuates such continuing inequalities. It has a purpose and\nthat purpose is gendered discrimination, which should be interpreted as con-\nstituting a prohibited purpose for the purpose, so to speak, of constituting\ntorture.\nThe focus here, thus far, has been on bringing rape within the \u2018discrimi-\nnation of any kind\u2019 purpose. However, not only does and should rape satisfy\nthis discriminatory purpose required for torture, but it could also come within\nother prohibited purposes, namely intimidation, coercion or even punishment.\nAs the ICTR stated in Akayesu, like torture, rape is in fact \u2018used for such\npurposes as intimidation, degradation, humiliation, discrimination, punish-\nment, control or destruction of a person\u2019.106 Indeed, other jurisdictions take a\nmore expansive approach to the \u2018purpose\u2019 of torture, with the Inter-American\nTorture Convention including as prohibited purposes \u2018personal punishment\u2019\nand a general criterion of \u2018or for any other purpose\u2019.107 The ICTY has ex-\npanded the scope of the prohibited purposes in the definition of torture to\ninclude \u2018humiliation\u2019 holding that this was warranted \u2018by the general spirit of\ninternational humanitarian law: the primary purpose of this body of law is to\nsafeguard human dignity\u2019.108 In the particular case, the ICTY held that the\nvictim was raped in order to \u2018degrade and humiliate\u2019 her.109 Such approaches\nbroaden the definition of torture quite significantly: a purpose of \u2018humiliation\u2019\ncould be found in a large number of rapes, perhaps even all rapes.\nWhile feminist scholars have criticized the purposive criterion for torture,\non the basis that it is \u2018reinforcing the \u201cmale\u201d context of torture as it implies\nthat torture only takes place within the context of arrest, interrogation and\ndetention\u2019,110 it seems clear that it is an essential element of a torture enquiry\nin Convention jurisprudence. Accordingly, my argument is that all rapes are\n104 Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, Recommendation Rec (2002) to member\nstates on the protection of violence against women, 30 April 2002.\n105 MC v Bulgaria (n 4) para 165, emphasis added.\n106 Akayesu (n 2) para 597. 107 Discussed in Edwards (n 5) 382\u2013384.\n108 Prosecutor v Furundzija (Judgment) ICTY-95-17\/1-T, 10 December 1998, para 162.\n109 ibid paras 124, 130.

There is no evidence yet that the Court will adopt such an interpretation\nof \u2018purpose\u2019. However, in increasingly looking to the UN Convention for\nguidance, I suggest that the Court should endorse a broad interpretation of\npurpose, beyond just extraction of confessions and information, thereby taking\ncognizance of the fact that the problem of torture comes not just from physical\nharm but also from the loss of dignity and respect.111 Furthermore, while\nthe emphasis on purpose, as an element of torture, shifts the focus onto the\nperpetrator, as compared with the severity threshold which concentrates on\nthe victim, we must ensure that we are not blinded into concentrating on\nsupposedly individualised reasons for rape, such as sexual gratification, and\nremember the societal and political context of the reality of rape.\nIn sum, the claim that all rapes are for a prohibited purpose does not mean\nthat all rapes will constitute torture. Not only must the threshold of severity be\nmet, but the rape in Aydin v Turkey, it will be remembered, was perpetrated by\na State official. Torture, under the Convention legal system, is about State\nresponsibility for serious violence and abuse. A crucial definitional question\nthen becomes what or who constitutes the State? And in what circumstances,\ntherefore, is the State responsible for rape?\nV. STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RAPE AS TORTURE\nAydin v Turkey was a clear example of rape by the State. Sukran Aydin was\nraped in detention by a State official for the purposes of intimidation and\nextraction of information. While this paradigmatic situation falls squarely\nwithin the torture protection of Article 3, the more interesting and challenging\nquestions surround the boundaries of the concept of the State and therefore the\nreach of State responsibility for rape as torture.\nTraditionally, the system of international human rights protection has been\npremised on ensuring state responsibility for breaches of those norms deemed\nsufficiently fundamental to qualify as \u2018human rights\u2019. International protection\nhas been necessary in order to hold individual States to account where the\nState itself is responsible for violating those fundamental rights, as in Aydin v\nTurkey. The international system of human rights protection, therefore, has\nbeen premised on securing State compliance with established norms and in-\nvestigating possible State violations. The traditional rationale for this \u2018State\nactor\u2019 requirement is that \u2018private acts (of brutality) would usually be ordinary\ncriminal offences which national law enforcement is expected to press.\nInternational concern with torture arises only when the State itself abandons\n111 On the status of the UN Convention approach to torture, the ICTY has opined that there is\n\u2018now a general acceptance of the main elements contained in the definition set out in article 1\u2019 of\nthe UN Convention: Furundzija (n 108) para 153.\n586 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nits function of protecting its citizenry by sanctioning criminal action by law\nenforcement personnel\u2019.112 Accordingly, the Convention system is about State\nresponsibility for violations of the Convention. Similarly, and in the specific\narea of torture, the UN Convention restricts the scope of its definition of\ntorture to conduct \u2018inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent\nor acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official\ncapacity\u2019.113 A connection with the State must be established for there to be\nresponsibility and jurisdiction under these legal regimes.\nThis may all appear obvious and was certainly settled jurisprudence until\ntwo particular changes and developments over the last decade or more. The\nfirst is the growing recognition that a state-centred approach to international\nlaw in general, and international human rights law in particular, is no longer\nappropriate. As Philip Alston has put it, \u2018the world is a much more poly-\ncentric place than it was\u2019 and viewing the world through the prism of the state\nis a \u2018rather distorted image\u2019 for the 21st century.114 Power is more diffuse and\nnon-state actors are more and more responsible for activities hitherto confined\nto state control. This has an impact on the concept of state responsibility and\nthe scope of the \u2018State actor\u2019 requirement in human rights law. The second\ndevelopment is the growing recognition that for human rights norms to make a\nreal impact on the variety of ways in which peoples\u2019 rights are infringed, states\nneed to be more proactive in ensuring protection of rights. Such an advance\nhas meant that human rights obligations on States now extend far beyond\nthe traditional confines of negative rights, towards positive requirements or\nobligations to take action to secure and protect rights.\nReturning to the torture context, these developments have complicated the\npicture and have challenged the assumption that torture is only realized where\nacts are carried out directly by the state. A key area of critique of the state\nactor requirement is in relation to sexual violence and, in particular, its use\nin evading state responsibility for the prevalence of sexual violence. Indeed,\nas Alice Edwards remarks, the UN Convention torture definition, with its\nrequirement for State participation, has been \u2018the object of near unanimous\ndisapproval by feminist writers\u2019.115 For example, Hilary Charlesworth,\nChristine Chinkin and Shelley Wright argue that the \u2018severe pain and suffering\nthat is inflicted outside the most public context of the State\u2014for example,\nwithin the home or by private persons, which is the most pervasive and\n112 N Rodley, \u2018The Evolution of the International Prohibition of Torture\u2019 in Amnesty\nInternational, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948\u20131988: Human Rights, the UN\nand Amnesty International, 63, discussed in H Charlesworth, C Chinkin and S Wright \u2018Feminist\nApproaches to International Law\u2019 (1991) 85 AJIL 613, 628.\n113 Article 1 (n 62).\n114 P Alston, \u2018The \u201cNot-a-Cat\u201d Syndrome: Can the International Human Rights Regime\nAccommodate Non-State Actors?\u2019 in P Alston (ed), Non-State Actors and Human Rights (OUP,\nOxford, 2005) 3, 4.

Such a dis-\ntinction clearly has significant implications for the offence of rape, as it is\nmost often perpetrated by private individuals against other private individuals.\nHowever, in light of the developments and changes in human rights norms\nin recent years, it may be that the boundaries between State and non-State\naction are not as clear as they once were and therefore that there is increased\nscope for a broader concept of state responsibility. Indeed, Malcolm Evans\nrefers to a \u2018dramatic broadening\u2019 of what falls within the scope of acts of state\nofficials under Convention jurisprudence.117 However, before addressing what\nconstitutes State acts, the first question is to clarify whether, for acts to come\nwithin torture under Article 3, they must indeed be carried out by State offi-\ncials.\nAs noted above, the UN Convention restricts the scope of acts of torture to\nconduct \u2018inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiesc-\nence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity\u2019. Thus,\nwhile the UN Convention is explicit in its definition of when State liability for\ntorture will ensue, the European Convention is absent on such issues and the\nCourt has been reluctant to draw clear boundaries. Nonetheless, in every case\nin which there has been a positive finding of torture, the conduct in question\nhas been meted out by a state official.118 But does this mean that for there\nto be torture there must have been acts of State officials? In Kaya v Turkey the\nCourt considered whether Hasan Kaya had been tortured before being killed.\nThe Court noted that it had not found that any State agent was directly res-\nponsible for Kaya\u2019s death,119 but continued nonetheless to consider whether\n116 Charlesworth et al (n 112) 629. 117 Evans (n 18) 378.\n118 In relation to acts by State actors, the Court does appear willing to draw the net wider than\njust state sanctioned acts. In Cyprus v Turkey (1982) 4 EHRR 482 while there was no finding of\ntorture for the rape of Cypriot women by Turkish soldiers, there was inhuman treatment carried\nout by \u2018State actors\u2019 which was beyond their official authority. This responsibility for ultra vires\nacts has been accepted by the Human Rights Committee responsible for the implementation of the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Human Rights Committee has found\nthat State responsibility extends to ultra vires acts of State officials, HRC GC no 7, para 2, by\nstating that state responsibility extends to acts \u2018whether inflicted by people acting in their official\ncapacity, outside their official capacity or in a private capacity\u2019: HRC GC no 20, paras 2 and 13,\ndiscussed in Edwards (n 5) 365. This is a logical extension in the scope of acts attributed to States\nin that a victim may not know whether the person is acting under State authority, or ultra vires,\nand due to that lack of knowledge, the perception of the nature of the ill-treatment does not\nchange. In other words, the aggravation of the harm of rape by a state official, as discussed above,\nis present whether or not the person is acting within their authority or not. Equally, control\nexercised by the state over its officials may well be greater if liability extends to ultra vires acts.\nTherefore, it is argued that the European Court should develop its jurisprudence, if\/when con-\nfronted with this issue, to extend liability for ultra vires acts to encompass tortuous treatment,\nfollowing the international example of the Human Rights Committee.\n119 Kaya v Turkey [2000] ECHR 129, para 114.\n588 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nhis treatment constituted torture. In setting out the relevant criteria, the Court\nreferred to its previous jurisprudence on the \u2018special stigma\u2019 of torture, the\nrequirement of very serious and cruel suffering and to the need to demonstrate\na \u2018purposive element\u2019 to the conduct.120 The fact that the Court explicitly\nstated that a State agent was not responsible for the acts in question, but\ncontinued to consider whether the treatment amounted to torture, is a clear\nimplication that for a finding of torture, there does not have to be direct acts by\na State agent. In the case itself, the Court held that it was the medical evidence\nwhich did not disclose a level of suffering of sufficient severity to amount to\ntorture.121\nWhile Kaya v Turkey cannot be taken as dispositive of this issue, clear\nimplications can be drawn regarding the Court\u2019s approach. When considered\ntogether with other jurisprudence of the Court, it seems that this is another\nexample of the Court retaining flexibility over the scope of Article 3, and the\ntorture protection therein, in order to meet new demands and situations. The\nCourt has often stated that the Convention must be interpreted as a \u2018living\ninstrument which must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions\u2019\nand specifically in relation to torture it held in Selmouni that \u2018certain acts\nwhich were classified in the past as \u201cinhuman and degrading treatment\u201d as\nopposed to \u201ctorture\u201d could be classified differently today\u2019.122 While Selmouni\nwas about thresholds for torture, it demonstrates the flexibility being dis-\ncussed. More specifically, in D v UK, concerning deportation to face ill-\ntreatment, the Court held that there could be a violation of Article 3 even\nwhere the risk of harm to the individual concerned did not \u2018engage either\ndirectly or indirectly the responsibility of the public authorities\u2019 in the relevant\nState.123 It continued that the Court \u2018must reserve to itself sufficient flexibility\nto address the application of that Article [Article 3] in other contexts which\nmight arise\u2019.124\nConsidering this line of case law, and its implications for the current dis-\ncussion of rape and torture, it seems possible that a finding of torture may be\npossible even where the treatment at issue is not directly perpetrated by a State\nofficial. This does represent a significant departure (and advance) from tra-\nditional understandings of state responsibility for torture. Further, it would go\nsome way towards meeting some feminist criticism of the state actor re-\nquirement in view of the fact that the vast majority of rapes are not perpetrated\nby State officials, but by private individuals and all such rapes could possibly\nconstitute torture, so long as they met the threshold of severity of harm (the\npurposive element being met in all rape cases).\n120 ibid para 117. 121 ibid para 118.\n122 Selmouni v France (n 73) para 101.\n123 D v UK (1997) 24 EHRR 423, para 49.\n124 ibid para 49, discussed in R McCorquodale and R La Forgia \u2018Taking off the Blindfolds:\nTorture by Non-State Actors\u2019 (2001) 1 Human Rights Law Review 189, 210\u2013211.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 589\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nNonetheless, jurisdiction of the Convention is based on State responsibility\nand so there remains the requirement for a nexus to the state. This State\nresponsibility can take a number of different forms, discussed below in three\nbroad categories. First, there has been considerable debate and case law de-\nvelopment in recent years surrounding the circumstances in which the acts of\nnon-state actors can be attributed to the state. In the case of rape as torture,\nthese debates have most resonance in states where there has been a breakdown\nin State power such that, for example, rebel groups are in de facto control of\nparts of territory. Thus in Elmi v Australia the Committee Against Torture\n(CAT), the supervisory body that interprets and applies the UN Convention on\nTorture, determined that actions by non-State actors could, in certain cir-\ncumstances where they were acting with de facto State authority, be deemed\nsufficiently \u2018State-like\u2019 to bring those actions within the state responsibility\nrequirement of the UN Convention.125 Nonetheless, the Committee has in-\nterpreted this \u2018State-like\u2019 quality in a very limited way, restricting the scope of\nnon-state actors and the concept of acquiescence to \u2018quasi-governmental\nstructures which exercise effective control over a territory or where there is no\ncentral government\u2019.126 This is a very high threshold and, as Edwards points\nout, precludes the application of the UN Convention to many harms facing\nwomen.127 Further, in the European context regarding rape, this approach to\nexpanding the reach of State responsibility to non-state actors exercising\nde facto state control is of limited relevance as few rapes in such circum-\nstances occur within Europe.128\nThe second and more common type of situation is where it is alleged that\nprivate individuals acted with state acquiescence or consent. As noted above,\nunder the UN Convention state liability includes acts inflicted by, or at the\ninstigation of \u2018or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other\nperson acting in an official capacity\u2019. Much debate has surrounded the scope\nof this consent or acquiescence standard. A significant case in this respect is\nDzemajl v Yugoslavia, under the UN Convention, in which it was held that the\nstate had acquiesced to the cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of the Roma\ncomplainants which was witnessed by the police and in respect of which there\nwas a wholly inadequate investigation. The CAT decided that the relevant\nstate authorities had \u2018acquiesced\u2019 in the ill-treatment on the basis that although\nthe police \u2018had been informed of the immediate risk that the complainants\nwere facing and had been present at the scene of events\u2019, they \u2018did not take\nany appropriate steps to protect the complainants\u2019.129 The CAT went on to\naffirm that although \u2018the acts referred to by the complainants were not com-\nmitted by public officials themselves, the Committee considers that they were\n125 (120\/1998), 7 IHRR (2000).

While this was a case of ill-treatment, rather than torture, there does\nnot appear to be any valid reason why these principles should not equally\napply to the torture prohibition.131 Further, Edwards suggests that if the\nreasoning in this case were followed, \u2018it could prove pivotal to holding the\nstate responsible in specific domestic or family violence or other non-state-\nactor cases\u2019.132 Similar cases can be found in Convention jurisprudence,\nthough the language of consent or acquiescence is not used, but that of\n\u2018positive obligations\u2019 and some of the facts are less stark than in Dzemajl\nwhere the police were actually present and witnessing the violence. For ex-\nample, in Z v the UK, the Court found a violation of Article 3 where a local\nauthority had failed to take steps to protect children known to be at risk of ill-\ntreatment by their parents.133 The Court noted that states are required \u2018to take\nmeasures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not\nsubjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, including ill-treatment\nadministered by private individuals\u2019.134 The Court continued that such\nmeasures should provide effective protection and \u2018include reasonable steps\nto prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had\nknowledge\u2019.135 Malcolm Evans emphasizes that this ruling seems \u2018to be the\nmost far reaching pronouncement yet on the scope of State responsibility\nunder Article 3\u2019.136\nThis ruling is similar to Kaya v Turkey where the Court held that the State\n\u2018authorities knew or ought to have known\u2019 that Hasan Kaya was at risk of\nbeing targeted by \u2018certain elements of the security forces or those acting on\ntheir behalf\u2019.137 It continued that the failure to \u2018protect his life through specific\nmeasures and through the general failings in the criminal law framework\nplaced him in danger not only of extra-judicial execution but also of ill-\ntreatment from persons who were unaccountable for their actions\u2019.138 It con-\ncluded that \u2018the State is responsible for the ill-treatment suffered by Hasan\nKaya after his disappearance and prior to his death\u2019.139\n130 ibid para 9.2.\n131 Note that there was an Individual Opinion submitted by two members in dissent at the\nCommittee\u2019s decision which argued that the conduct in question did amount to torture within the\nmeaning of Article 1 of the UN Convention, discussed in Edwards (n 5) 373.\n132 Edwards (n 5) 373.\n133 Z v UK (2002) 34 EHRR 3. See also Al Adsani v UK (2002) 34 EHRR 11, para 38: \u2018It is true\nthat taken together, Articles 1 and 2 place a number of positive obligations on the High\nContracting Parties, designed to prevent and provide redress for torture and other forms of ill-\ntreatment.\u2019 See also A v UK (1999) 27 EHRR 611, para 22.\n134 Z v UK, ibid. 135 ibid para 73. 136 Evans (n 18) 379.\n137 Kaya (n 119) para 74. 138 ibid para 116. 139 ibid.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 591\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nWhile in both Z v the UK and Kaya v Turkey the State was held responsible\nfor the ill-treatment, not torture, of the individuals involved, there is nothing to\nsuggest that a similar finding could not be made in respect of torture. In Z v the\nUK the Court includes reference to torture when outlining its approach and in\nKaya v Turkey it considered the possibility of torture, but rejected that claim\nonly on the basis of the medical evidence, not principle. The Court classifies\nthese cases as ones involving \u2018state responsibility\u2019 where the \u2018authorities fail\nto take reasonable steps to avoid a risk of ill-treatment about which they know\nor ought to have known\u2019.140 This type of situation is distinguished from State\nresponsibility \u2018where the framework of law fails to provide adequate protec-\ntion\u2019,141 but which is still characterized as part of the positive obligations of\nthe State.\nArguably, the State responsibility in both of these cases, and similar ones,\nmay be better characterised as responsibility due to the consent or acquiesc-\nence of the state to known harms, or those in which it was deemed that they\nought to have had knowledge. In this way, as Nigel Rodley argues \u2018govern-\nment officials at all levels may be held responsible if they failed to stop torture\nwhere it occurs. Failure so to act could well be interpreted at least as acquie-\nsence\u2019.142 So, acquiescence encompasses both situations where the state has\neffectively lost control of part of a territory and where it takes no action in\nrelation to the known activities of non-State actors and private persons.143\nThis analysis differentiates between two situations which have generally\nboth been classed as involving the State\u2019s positive obligations: first, where the\nState is aware of the harm or possible harm, but fails to take action (as in Z\nv the UK) and, secondly, where there is a more generic failing on the part of\nthe state, in terms of its legislative or administrative structures or processes.\nThe former situation, it has been suggested above, should be characterised as\nengaging the responsibility of the State due to its consent or acquiescence,\nwith the latter cases incurring States\u2019 \u2018positive obligations\u2019. The value in\nseparating out the different forms of positive obligations is in terms of\nculpability. Z v the UK arguably differs from other cases characterised as\nengaging the state\u2019s \u2018positive obligations\u2019 such as X and Y v the Netherlands,\nwhere the Dutch state failed to proscribe to a sufficient extent the rape of a\nmentally disabled individual and MC v Bulgaria where the Bulgarian state\nwas held responsible for its failure to ensure that all rapes were appropriately\ninvestigated and proscribed by law. The difference is that in Z v the UK and\nsimilar cases the State has been put on notice and, in failing to take action, the\nState allowed the particular ill-treatment or torture to continue. In this way, the\n140 ibid para 115. 141 ibid.\n142 N Rodley, The Treatment of Prisoners under International Law, (2nd edn, Clarendon Press,\nOxford, 1999) 100, quoted in McCorquodale and La Forgia (n 124) 206.\n143 As suggested by McCorquodale and La Forgia (n 124) 206.\n592 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nState has direct responsibility for the acts, and analogising this to the UN\nConvention system, the state actor requirement therein would be fulfilled.\nIn relation to the offence of rape, this situation, in which the authorities\nhave cognizance of a known risk, is most likely to occur in the context of other\nforms of sexual or gender-based violence, such as domestic abuse in the home.\nThis is an area in which is it well recognised that States are generally poor at\nresponding to instances of abuse brought to their attention. The increased level\nof culpability attributed to a \u2018consent or acquiescence\u2019 finding of torture or ill-\ntreatment, may have an effect of ensuring greater cognizance is taken of re-\nports to the relevant State authorities. This situation is differentiated from one\nin which a State has a \u2018mere inability to act or lack of knowledge\u2019 which\nwould not satisfy the current UN Convention standard of \u2018consent or acqui-\nescence\u2019.144\nSuch circumstances differ from that in cases such as MC v Bulgaria where\nthe failings identified by the Court, relating to the legislative, administrative\nand prosecutorial failings in respect of rapes not involving violence, applied\nequally to all citizens. In this sense, it is a universal failing which existed\nprior to any actual instance of abuse or harm in the case in question. In such\ncircumstances, where the State was unaware of a particular risk by non-state\nactors, it cannot be held directly responsible for not preventing it. But it can be\nheld responsible for either administrative failings in terms of investigations\nand\/or for general inadequacies of the legislative framework. Thus, in MC v\nBulgaria the State was not held responsible for the alleged rape itself, but\nmerely for its failure to ensure an adequate investigation, as well as the State\u2019s\nfailure to have in place the appropriate mechanisms for dealing with all forms\nof rape: both options being described as the \u2018next best thing\u2019.145 On the con-\ntrary, following the analysis suggested, in Z v the UK the State would be held\ndirectly responsible for the ill-treatment, with appropriate political and\nfinancial consequences.\nThis should not suggest that a finding that a State has violated its positive\nobligations is not significant. Indeed, it is possible to argue that it is only\nthrough such rulings, if they effect the necessary changes at state level, that\nreal change and improvements will be generated. The situation is as stark as\nClapham has claimed:\n\u2018If the national criminal system is unable or unwilling to prosecute certain acts of\nviolence, it becomes a matter for the European Court of Human Rights, which\nwill hold the state responsible for failing to protect individuals from non-state\nactor violence by ineffectively securing their human rights.\u2019146\nTo conclude this section, it has been argued that the Court is more fluid in its\napproach to determining whether torture, or ill-treatment, has been estab-\nlished, than other human rights instruments. While all positive findings of\n144 Edwards (n 5) 374. 145 Evans (n 18) 379. 146 Clapham (n 6) 376.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 593\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\ntorture to date have indeed involved State actors, there is no indication in the\njurisprudence that this is an essential criterion for a finding of torture. It was\nthen argued that the concept of positive obligations could usefully be devel-\noped so that where the State has been made aware of certain harms, or risk of\nharm, it is held liable for direct acts of torture (or ill-treatment) on the basis\nthat it either consented or acquiesced in the treatment in question. Such a\ndevelopment would follow, and develop, the approach of the UN Convention,\nwhich the Court has been increasingly citing in recent cases. Such jur-\nisprudential developments would ensure that States are held directly respon-\nsible for acts of rape in a greater number of situations than is presently the\ncase. This direct responsibility for torture is important symbolically and has\njurisprudential and financial implications. As Edwards has suggested, while\nfeminist criticism of the UN Convention definition of torture is valid, this is\nnot so much in relation to the fact that the claim has to be mounted against a\npublic official or the State, since this is a prerequisite for any human rights\nviolation under international law, but in relation to the fact that the concepts of\n\u2018consent or acquiescence have failed to be interpreted in a sufficiently broad\nmanner\u2019.147\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nThe United Nations has noted that \u2018significant efforts have been applied to\nredefine the meaning of human rights to encompass the specific experiences of\nwomen\u2019.148 Such efforts were successful in Aydin v Turkey which represented\na significant triumph in ensuring recognition for the harm of rape as torture.\nYet, Aydin v Turkey was a paradigmatic torture case, perpetrated by a state\nofficial, in State detention, for ostensibly political purposes. Since this judg-\nment, the Court has developed its jurisprudence on torture, and on sexual\nviolence, in a number of important ways. Specifically in relation to torture, the\nCourt has entrenched the purposive element of the definition of torture, at the\nsame time as retaining flexibility in its approach and, most remarkably, has\nalluded to the possibility of torture by private individuals. In its sexual viol-\nence case load, the Court has repeatedly emphasized the gravity of such\nharms, recognising their assault on human dignity and autonomy, and as a\nresult has regularly found State responses totally inadequate.\nBringing these two strands of jurisprudence together, it is possible to be\noptimistic about the future approach of the Court to cases of rape as torture.\nIndeed, if the Court continues to develop its jurisprudence on torture, re-\ncognizing torture beyond the paradigmatic, it will begin to address the varied\nways in which women are tortured and the fact that their torturers are so often\n147 Edwards (n 5) 375.\n148 Report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to Commission Resolution 1998\/29,\n18 December 1998, UN Doc E\/CN.4\/1999\/92, para 12, discussed in Clapham (n 6) 15.\n594 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 Mar 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.66\nprivate individuals. Further, if the Court follows through its approach to\nsexual violence, as constituting a key factor in women\u2019s inequality and con-\ntinuing as a result of societal and political failings, it will recognize that the\npurpose of such violence is discriminatory. And, if the Court advances its\napproach to state responsibility, demanding that states take greater steps to\nboth forestall the occurrence of human rights abuses and take concrete action\nwhen informed of existing harms or risks of harm, more may be done to\nprevent sexual violence and better procedures may be put in place to investi-\ngate complaints and ensuring justice. My optimism is therefore contingent.\nNonetheless, there are clear grounds for hoping that the Court may once again,\nas it did in Aydin v Turkey, show the international community the way forward\nin treating rape as torture.\nRape, Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights 595\n"}
