The large g factor \u0001\u221251\u0002\nalso makes InSb QWs attractive for spintronics and quantum\ninformation processing, and the motivation of the work re-\nported here is the realization of the surface acoustic wave\n\u0001SAW\u0002 single photon source,3 using InSb\/AlxIn1\u2212xSb QWs\nto give emission in the 3\u20135 \u0001m wavelength region.4 This\nwould enable long distance free-space secure communica-\ntion, via quantum cryptography, with low atmospheric scat-\ntering and absorption.5 In this letter we describe\nInSb\/AlxIn1\u2212xSb QW light-emitting-diodes \u0001LEDs\u0002 which,\ncombined with a simple technique for the fabrication of lat-\neral diodes,6 represent a significant step towards the fabrica-\ntion of a SAW single photon source emitting in the midin-\nfrared. Additionally, the LEDs described here might also find\napplication in areas such as gas sensing.7\nThe samples studied were grown by molecular beam ep-\nitaxy at QinetiQ Malvern on semi-insulating GaAs\nsubstrates.1 A schematic diagram of the QW LED structure is\nshown in Fig. 1. The InSb QWs were grown on top of a\n3-\u0001m-thick AlxIn1\u2212xSb barrier, and were capped with a 120-\nnm-thick layer of AlxIn1\u2212xSb. Tellurium and beryllium were\nused to dope the layers n type and p type to nominal levels of\n2\u00021017 cm\u22123 and 5\u00021018 cm\u22123, respectively. Two different\nQW structures were investigated: QW1 contained a 40-nm-\nthick undoped InSb QW, with a barrier composition of x\n=0.077 and QW2 contained a 20-nm-thick undoped InSb\na\u0002Electronic mail: grnash@qinetiq.com\n0003-6951\/2006\/88\u00025\u0001\/051107\/3\/$23.00 88, 05110\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Measurements\nfrom these samples were also compared to LEDs that con-\ntained no quantum wells: B1 contained a\n2-\u0001m-thick undoped AlxIn1\u2212xSb active layer of similar com-\nposition to the barrier material in QW1 \u0001x=0.0875\u0002, and B2\ncontained a 2-\u0001m-thick undoped InSb active layer. Further\ndetails of similar bulk LEDs can be found in Ref. 7. The\ncomposition of the AlxIn1\u2212xSb layers was determined by\nx-ray diffraction. Devices were fabricated using a series con-\nnected architecture,7 yielding LEDs with a total emitting area\nof \u00051 mm2. These were mounted substrate side down onto\nstandard TO2 carriers, producing top emitting devices. No\nantireflection coating was applied, and measurements were\nperformed at room temperature.\nFigures 2\u0001a\u0002 and 2\u0001b\u0002 show typical forward bias emission\nspectra, measured on a Fourier-transform infrared \u0001FTIR\u0002\nspectrometer using a calibrated 77 K HgCdTe detector, for\nsamples B1 and QW1, respectively.

The spectra were calibrated by calculating the\ntotal power emitted from the devices \u0001driven as above\u0002 using\na second calibrated detector, correcting for the collection ef-\nficiency of the optics. An identical configuration was used\nfor each sample so that the values obtained can be compared\nfrom one sample to another. Minima in both spectra seen at\naround 292 meV are due to CO2 absorption, whereas the\nlarge minimum seen in the QW1 spectrum at 216 meV is due\nto water absorption. The measured emittance maximum,\nMpeak, occurs at significantly different energies for the two\nsamples; 325 meV\u00b15 meV for B1 and 228 meV\u00b15 meV for\nQW1. The latter is also considerably larger than the energy at\nwhich Mpeak occurs for the InSb sample B2 \u0003Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u0004, sug-\nFIG. 2.

Redistribution subject togesting that emission in QW1 is due to recombination within\nthe InSb quantum well. The emission from QW1 between\napproximately 300 and 350 meV is thought to be from the\nAlxIn1\u2212xSb barrier. Also shown in Fig. 2 are the typical spec-\ntral responses of B1 and QW1, which were measured at zero\napplied bias using the FTIR spectrometer, and calibrated by\nmeasuring the integrated response of the device to a known\n500 K blackbody source. The photodetector quantum effi-\nciency, which is defined as the percentage of photons de-\ntected, has a peak of \u000516% at 440 meV for B1, and \u000519%\nat 480 meV for QW1. The spectral responses of the two\nsamples above energies around 300 meV are broadly similar,\nas expected, with the differences probably due to differences\nin transmission through the layers above the active layer \u0001B1\nand B2 contain a 1 \u0001m thick, rather than 100 nm, heavily\ndoped p-type layer above the active layer\u0002. However, al-\nthough the response from B1 approaches zero at energies\nbelow 300 meV, there is a clear response from QW1 between\n200 and 300 meV. This overlaps with the emission spectrum\nfrom the same sample and suggests that absorption is taking\nplace within the quantum well.\nFigures 3\u0001a\u0002 and 3\u0001b\u0002 show the measured forward bias\nemission spectra, and spectral response, of samples B2 and\nQW2, measured as described earlier. Mpeak occurs at a much\ngreater energy for sample QW2 \u0001236 meV\u00b15 meV\u0002 than for\nsample B2 \u0001194 meV\u00b15 meV\u0002, and the response of QW2\n\u0003Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004 also extends to much lower energies than would\nbe expected if the sample contained no quantum well \u0001the\nband gap of the barrier material in this sample is \u0005 450 meV\nat room temperature\u0002. The dashed lines shown in Figs. 2\u0001b\u0002\nand 3\u0001b\u0002 are the spontaneous emission spectra of QW1 and\nQW2 modeled using 8\u00028 k\u00b7p theory with strain taken into\naccount.8 Reasonable values of injected carrier densities \u00014\n\u00021011 cm\u22122 for both samples\u0002, and a commonly used value\nof inhomogeneous broadening \u000120 meV at room\ntemperature\u00028 were chosen to compare the calculated and\nmeasured spectra for both samples. The aim of these calcu-\nlations was to compare the energy positions of the experi-\nmental and modeled emission peaks, to confirm that emis-\nsion was from confined levels within the quantum well, and\nto calculate the ratio of emittances from the two samples.\nAbsolute values of emittance were not calculated at this\nstage. The two modeled spectra were therefore scaled by the\nidentical amount to fit on the same graphs as the measured\ndata. The calculated energies of the emission peak are in\ngood agreement with the experimental data for both samples,\nconfirming that recombination is taking place within the\nquantum wells. For QW2 \u000120 nm well\u0002 the emission peak\ncorresponds to the optical transition between the ground\nelectron and hole levels, which is not the case for QW1 \u000140\nnm well\u0002 for the same injected carrier density. In the calcu-\nlated emission spectrum for QW2 there is also a shoulder at\naround 300 meV, which is due to the lowest energy excited\ntransition. This shoulder, although heavily masked by the\nCO2 absorption, can be also seen in the experimental data,\nindicating that the model is able to accurately predict the\nenergies of both the ground and excited state emission peaks.\nFinally, the calculated ratio of 2.86 between the emittance\npeaks from QW1 and QW2 is in good agreement with the\nexperimental value of approximately 2.3, with the narrower\nwell giving the larger emittance peak in both cases.\nThe total integrated emission from samples QW1 and\n2QW2 was calculated as 3.1 and 5.3 mW\/cm , respectively\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\n051107-3 Nash et al.

Lett. 88, 051107 \u00022006\u0001\u0001these values have an unknown systematic error estimated to\nbe in the range \u00b120%\u0002, corresponding to external quantum\nefficiencies of 1.4\u000210\u22124 for QW1 and 2.4\u000210\u22124 for QW2.\nThe internal quantum efficiencies can be estimated by mul-\ntiplying the external efficiencies by n\u0001n+1\u00022, where n is the\nrefractive index of the active layer \u00013.96 for InSb, 3.88 for\nAl0.088In0.912Sb\u0002, yielding values of 0.9% and 1.6% for\nsamples QW1 and QW2, respectively. The higher values of\nboth integrated emission and efficiencies obtained for QW2,\nwhich has the thinnest quantum well and highest barriers,\nmight be expected due to better spatial confinement of the\ninjected carriers. The total integrated emission from samples\nB1 and B2 was calculated to be 4.0 and 7.2 mW\/cm2, which\nare comparable to measurements on similar diodes,7 with\ncorresponding external\/internal efficiencies of 3.2\n\u000210\u22124 \/2.0% and 3.6\u000210\u22124 \/2.4%. These are of the same\norder of magnitude as the QW devices, although direct com-\nparison between the bulk and QW samples is difficult due to\ntheir different structures. In particular, significant absorption\nof the emitted light within the 1-\u0001m-thick top p-type layer is\nexpected in the bulk samples.9 Finally, in Fig. 4 typical inte-\ngrated emittances are plotted as a function of forward bias\ncurrent.

Further experiments are underway to in-\nvestigate the dominant recombination mechanisms in these\nsamples, and also the possible effects of thermal carrier es-\ncape from the quantum wells, in order to understand the\nobserved dependence of the emittance on current.\nIn conclusion, we have observed electroluminescence\nfrom single InSb\/AlxIn1\u2212xSb QW LEDs. This confirms the\nhigh-quality of the materials growth and strengthens the\nprospect that these quantum wells will find application in\ndevice concepts such as the SAW single photon source.\nQinetiQ acknowledges support for this work from the\nUK Department of Trade and Industry\u2019s Technology Pro-\ngramme.
