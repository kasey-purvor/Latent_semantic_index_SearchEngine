Seizure modelling\nThere has been significant effort put into modelling seizure progression. A seizure\nis generally defined as a transient disturbance of cerebral functioning due to an\nabnormal paroxysmal neuronal discharge in the brain.1 The majority of effort has\nbeen focused on modelling results obtained from electroencephalograms (EEGs).\nModels have been created utilizing partial differential equation (PDE) techniques,2\nstochastic differential equations,3 nonlinear dynamics models,4 and a variety of\nother methods. As a potential application of this work, an ideal model would prove\nan effective tool to supplement qualitative clinician assessment of EEG data for\ndiagnostic purposes. Although this has not yet been achieved, significant progress\nhas been made.\n103\n2nd Reading\nJuly 16, 2008 9:12 WSPC\/204-BRL 00063\n104 A. R. Oshmyansky & P. K. Maini\nIn this paper we focus an modelling data on seizure progression obtained from\noptical coherance imaging. The end purpose of this research is for therapeutic rather\nthan diagnostic use. During the process of optical coherence imaging, changes in the\noptical spectroscopic properties of neocortical tissue are directly visualized.5 The\nchanges in spectroscopic properties are directly correlated to changes in cerebral\nhemodynamic properties such as blood oxygenation and blood volume. As cerebral\nhemodynamics can serve as a proxy for neuronal activity, as it does in functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging, optical coherence imaging effectively results in visu-\nalization of neuronal activity on the brain surface.\nA recent application of this technique has been to visualize seizures occurring\nintraoperatively.5 Epilepsy is a condition of recurrent seizures which often origi-\nnate from a focus of pathologic neurons in the cerebral cortex.1 Epilepsy which\nis refractory to medical therapy is often treated by surgical resection of epileptic\nfoci. However, it is often difficult to locate an epileptic focus for resection. This\noften results in much more tissue than is necessary being removed during therapeu-\ntic surgery (a common epilepsy surgery is temporal lobectomy in which the entire\ntemporal lobe of a patient is removed when it is believed an epileptic focus is present\non the lobe) or too little being removed which eliminates the therapeutic benefit of\nsurgical intervention. Optical coherence imaging allows direct qualitative inspection\nof seizure initiation and progression from an epileptic focus, thus allowing better\nidentification of the boundaries of foci.\nThe aim of this paper is to model seizure progression on the surface of the brain\nwith a simple wave model on top of a curved manifold. It is hypothesized that this\nmodel can be directly applied to intra-operative optical coherence imaging data to\neffectively predict in a more quantitative fashion the origin of a seizure and the\nboundaries of an epileptic focus. This would then allow more effective resection\nwithin epilepsy surgery.\n2. Combining Geometry with Cellular Automata\nIn creating a model that would be most effective intra-operatively, one had to be\ncreated that would allow for easy selection of initial conditions. Essentially, we want\nto eventually allow surgeons to take an image obtained through imaging of intrinsic\noptical signals (IIOS, another term for optical coherence imaging) and select easily\nyet still accurately which groups of neurons are activated on the image. Ideally, an\nalgorithm based on our model would then determine the boundaries of an epileptic\nfocus.\nTo select groups of activated neurons on an image, we propose overlaying a grid\non an image obtained by IIOS. Cells which are partially filled are then labelled\nas \u201cdepolarized.\u201d It should then be easy to run a cellular automata6 simulation\non the grid after creating rules for how seizure progression should behave. In fact,\nthere is already an extensive literature on simulating neuronal activity using cellular\nautomata7 though usually not in so direct a fashion.\n2nd Reading\nJuly 16, 2008 9:12 WSPC\/204-BRL 00063\nA New Neurosurgical Tool 105\nHowever, the surface of the brain is of course not flat and therefore a flat grid\nwould obviously be ineffective for modelling the cerebral or cerebellar surface with-\nout some modification. The modification we propose is to designate each cell in the\nsimulation with a \u201ccurvature\u201d given by a Riemannian curvature tensor.\nThe concept of curvature on a Riemannian manifold is abstract but remarkably\nversatile. As a brief review, a manifold is a space such that an open neighborhood\naround each point in the space is locally Euclidean (further information on Rieman-\nnian geometry can be found in Petersen8). A Riemannian manifold more specifically\nis a manifold with a defined inner product at each point. The Riemannian curvature\ntensor can be used to define the curvature of a Riemannian manifold. If u and v\nare coordinate vector fields and w is a manifold, the Riemannian curvature tensor\ncan be defined by:\nR(u, v)w = \u2207u\u2207vw \u2212\u2207v\u2207uw (1)\nwhere \u2207 is the covariant derivative, a generalization of the derivative which gives a\nderivative along the tangent vectors of a manifold. Effectively, the tensor thus gives\nall information about the curvature of a point in a single quantity which does not\nrely on local coordinates.\nBeing able to refer to curvature with a single quantity is quite useful for our\npurposes. Background independence (lack of dependence on a local coordinate sys-\ntem) also proves to have utility. By defining a curvature at each cell in a cellular\nautomata simulation, one can approximate the curvature of a given manifold. Rules\nof a cellular automata simulation can then be easily modified to determine geodesic\nmotion on a curved \u201ccellular manifold\u201d rather than on a flat cellular automata grid.\n3. Using Cellular Manifolds to Model Seizures\nFrom observation of images obtained by IIOS and basic knowledge of neural physi-\nology,9 we will create rules for how a depolarized cell should interact with other cells\non a flat grid. In order to mimic neuronal dynamics grossly, all cells surrounding\na depolarized cell should become depolarized at the next time step after a wave of\ndepolarization has had time to fully propagate through a cell. After a given time\nperiod, the depolarized cell should begin to \u201crepolarize\u201d and enter a refractory\nperiod during which it cannot be depolarized.\nIt reality, some portions of a propagating depolarization wavefront on the cortex\nwould of course move faster than others given individual axon and dendrite lengths\nand connectivity of individual neurons. However, at the level of coarsity that is\nbeing dealt with in any given grid cell, thousands of neurons are being represented\nsimultaneously. We feel that it is safe to ignore this effect as it should prove minimal\nat the coarsity described.\nThe following rules are thus proposed for the cellular automata that shall be run:\n(1) At each step all squares in contact with a depolarized square become\ndepolarized if |\u2207uv| \u2217 t \u2264 c. \u2207u is the covariant derivative in the direction of\n2nd Reading\nJuly 16, 2008 9:12 WSPC\/204-BRL 00063\n106 A. R. Oshmyansky & P. K. Maini\nvector u. The vector u is a unit vector in the direction the depolarization from\nthe original depolarized square. v is a tangent vector to the brain manifold at\na touching square. t is the total time in terms of time steps that has been\nspent at a square. c is a constant given by the speed of the propagation of the\nwavefront.\n(2) If a square depolarizes its neighboring squares, it becomes repolarized.\n(3) A repolarized square cannot be depolarized again for tr time steps, given by a\nthe neuronal refractory period.\nNote that all vectors v are given by the Riemann curvature tensor at a given\npoint. Using the definition of the Riemann curvature tensor in local coordinates x\u00b5\n(written in Einstein summation notation):\nR\u03c1\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd = dx\u03c1(R(\u2202\u00b5, \u2202\u03bd)\u2202\u03c3) (2)\nthe tangent vectors v are merely the coordinate vector fields \u2202\u00b5 = \u2202\/\u2202x\u00b5 while\nvectors u correspond with the coordinates x\u03c1 that we choose based on the direction\nof depolarization wavefront propagation.\n4. Example and Qualitative Comparison to Actual Data\nData for direct comparison to simulations is not yet available to the authors at this\ntime. In lieu of this, we show a simplified example of the proposed technique and\nshow images obtained by IIOS during a seizure near the same area from available\nliterature10 for comparison. The similarities in depolarization progression seen on\nvisual inspection are clearly observed.\nTo illustrate the proposed technique, we overlay a grid on a plain intraoperative\nphotograph and run a cellular automata with the proposed rules starting from\nan arbitrary cell deemed to be the epileptic focus. Image 1 is taken at the very\nbeginning of the Sylvian fissure which is underneath the middle cerebral artery\nwhich extends from the bottom left to the center of the image. For the sake of\nsimplicity in illustration, curvature will be calculated only at the Sylvian fissure\nand only unit curvature values will be used. (That is, \u2207uv will always equal either\n1 or -1).\nFor the simulation, cells filled in yellow on image 2 have \u2207uv = 1 and cells filled\nin blue have \u2207uv = \u22121. On image 3, the actual simulation is shown. Green cells\nare depolarized in at each time-step.\nAn actual sequence from optical coherence imaging of a seizure is shown in image\n4. The similarity to the pattern of spread of the depolarization wavefront can be\nqualitatively observed. The spread pattern is very similar to that predicted from\nthe simplified simulation. Plans for more direct quantitative analysis of simulations\nare discussed in the next section.\n2nd Reading\nJuly 16, 2008 9:12 WSPC\/204-BRL 00063\nA New Neurosurgical Tool 107\n5. Future work\nGiven the methodology proposed in the paper, a practical neurosurgical tool will\nultimately be developed. Ideally, this tool will calculate brain curvature from pre-\noperative scans (MRI or CT) for each individual patient. Surgeons will be able\nto select areas seen to be depolarized on images taken by IIOS and the tool will\ncalculate the borders of epileptic foci.\nPresent work is focusing on creating a generic phantom which may be used for\nthe majority of patients without necessitating access to imaging. Once a phantom is\ncomplete, further work will compare directly modelled seizures with those actually\nvisualized. This will directly assess the quality of the proposed algorithm.\nThere is also a significant amount of interesting mathematics that can likely be\nextracted from the concept of a cellular manifold. Work without direct intent of an\napplication will be done to further expand on this idea.\nFigures\nFig. 1. Intraoperative picture of the beginning of the Sylvian Fissure.
