The first of these is an epistemological enquiry \nwhich focuses on the nature and the structure of the field. The second objective is a \nsociological one which focuses on the culture and practices of academics in the field. \nHowever whilst this traditional distinction can bring some clarity to an initial \nunderstanding of tourism studies, additional insights into the complexity and dynamics of \nthe field are obtained by adding a further layer of analysis. Here actor-network theory is \ndeployed to link relevant objects and reveal academic networks. Keywords: \nepistemology, social science of knowledge, power, culture, actor-network theory. \nIntroduction \nTourism is an activity of undisputed significance in contemporary society and the \nextraordinary growth of the phenomenon has given rise to a concomitant growth in the \ntourism academy and tourism knowledge. But the canon is fragmented, the subject \nremains a somewhat Cinderella area in the academy and its academics range from \nmanagement scientists and economists, through cultural geographers and anthropologists \nto sociologists. The pioneers who established the field are retiring, gradually superseded \nby a new generation of scholars so the field is at a crossroads in its development and \ntherefore ripe for critical review. \n \nThe aim of this article, prompted by Becher and Trowler\u2019s (2001) enquiry into Academic \nTribes and Territories, is to critically analyse tourism studies. This initially generates two \nobjectives - an epistemological enquiry focussing on the nature and structure of the field \nand a sociological enquiry focussing on the culture and practices of academics. The \noutcome is a better understanding of the field and the effects of its rules, hierarchies and \ncultures. The article commences with the method section. The main body combines \nliterature and findings discussing first the territories of the field and then its tribes. From \nthis a third objective, an understanding of actor networks, emerged. Finally the \nconclusion critically reflects on new ways of understanding the field and reviews key \nfindings. \nMethod \nThe method evolved over the course of this study. Central to it was a series of semi-\nstructured in-depth interviews and an open-ended email survey conducted with tourism \nacademics (researchers, lecturers, managers). A sampling frame was used to ensure that \nrespondents\u2019 attributes offered a range of locations, gender, academic seniority, \ndisciplines, ethnicity and age.  Academic seniority was defined as being a professor, \ndepartment head, or holding a position of high peer esteem. Table 1 shows the basic \ncharacteristics of the sample and demonstrates balance over gender and academic \nseniority but still with some bias towards older, white respondents operating in developed \ncountries. A comprehensive range of disciplines is represented including Economics, \nGeography, Sociology, Anthropology, Management and \u201cTourism\u201d. Considerable effort \nwas made to recruit outside of the Anglo\/US\/Australasian milieu of which the author is \npart and the sample includes those from South America, Canada, Africa, China, Europe, \nIsrael and India. \n \nTable 1: Sample \nCrude Categories Alleged Dominant Group \u201cOther\u201d \nAge \nn= \nO (Older, >40 Years) \n45 \nY (Younger, <40 years) \n22 \nGender \nn= \nM (Male) \n33 \nF (Female) \n34 \nStatus \nn= \nS (Senior: Key position) \n36 \nJ (Junior) \n31 \nColour \nn= \nW (White) \n52 \nNW (Non-white) \n15 \nLocation \nn= \nD (Developed) \n59 \nLD (Less Developed) \n8 \nSample, N=67 \n \nA qualitative approach satisfied the need to collect rich data and offer voice to the \nresearched. The duration of the interviews (typically 60 to 90 minutes) was of sufficient \nlength to allow complex issues to emerge. The interviews were face-to-face and enabled \nthe researcher to deeply probe and analyse the complexities of the field. The questions \nand categories were inspired by those used in the Becher and Trowler (2001) study. They \nwere adjusted in the light of a pilot study, mainly for clarity and to reduce excessive \nlength and over-direction. For the final version, informants were provided in advance \nwith a schedule of topics which guided the interviews and the following were of \nrelevance to this article: Networks; structure of field; epistemological issues and power \nand hierarchies. The interviewer encouraged the introduction of relevant but unforeseen \nissues.  \n \nDuring data collection new sources of data emerged. The first was a series of reflections \nby nine academics in a chapter titled Processes of Becoming: Academic Journeys, \nMoments and Reflections (Ateljevic et al., 2007). The second was a set of thirteen auto-\nethnographies (Nash, 2007) by senior academics in the sociology and anthropology of \ntourism. The arrival of these, along with the use of four other pre-exiting \nautobiographical accounts (Botterill, 2003; Hall, 2004; Ateljevic et al., 2005; Swain & \nHall, 2007) and an obituary (Airey, 2007) enabled data saturation to be achieved at an \nearlier stage than anticipated over some categories and so the interviews were \nrescheduled and questions edited in order to concentrate on under represented groups and \nunder explored themes. They were also supplemented by an email version of the survey. \nThe final sample size was determined by apparent data saturation at 67 subjects. This \ncomprised of 16 interviews, 22 email surveys and 29 other biographical or \nautobiographical accounts. Additionally the researcher\u2019s long period of participant \nobservation in the field was a source of data. \n \nThe interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The method of analysis was data \nimmersion with expert reading and re-reading against deep knowledge of the subject \nculminating in the clustering of data around key analytic headings. Tools such as N-\nVIVO were considered but the researcher was able to better and more imaginatively \nanalyse complex data using deep and prolonged contemplation aided by manual memos \nand generating and manipulating categories using the outline\/ headings feature in \nMicrosoft Word. This resulted in three possibilities of accommodation, modification and \nextension of the a priori categories in the light of data collected as well as the recognition \nof anomalies. An initial 30,000 words was first reduced to 18,000 and progressively to \n10,000 words whilst maintaining the essence of the data. Considerable space is devoted \nto the words of the informants in order to underline tourism studies as a human practice. \nIn reproducing their comments each is given an anonymous number as well as their \nprofile characteristics for which table 1 provides a key. Additionally book and page \nreferences are given where (auto)biographical accounts were sourced. The abbreviation \n\u201cIV\u201d stands for interviewer. Neither space nor time permitted analysis of different \nperceptions arising from age, gender etc. but this might be an interesting avenue to pursue \nin a future study. \n \nSome limitations and caveats to the method should be noted. First the researcher is a \nsenior academic and one interviewee noted that this might condition some responses. \nSecond the researcher is positioned and embodied. Bracketing (Creswell, 1998) is often \noffered as a strategy for isolating such effects. Of course the researcher attempted to \ncultivate an open mind but is reflexively aware of the limits to this. Third whilst the \nsample attempts to be inclusive it does not purport to be representative. Hence what is \noffered is one exploratory account amongst a range of possible others, but one that is \nplausible and measured in terms of the data, that triangulates with a wider literature and \nthat is transparent and qualified in terms of method. \nAcademic Tribes, Territories and Networks \nAn unreflexive view of tourism studies might be represented by what Barnes (2001, p. \n524) calls \u201cthe traditional model\u201d or \u201cpresentism\u201d where a discipline is seen as the result \nof some inevitable and focussed progressive working out of the issues at hand. In this \nview things could only work out in one way and the patterning of a discipline is almost \ndetermined by the (uncontested) facts of the matter which are there to be discovered and \nput together in a particular way, i.e. the academic territory of tourism is an inevitable, \nobjectively determined configuration. But a substantial literature has emerged which has \nsought to problematise the question of knowledge production. Prominent in these are \nBecher and Trowler (2001) who conducted a comprehensive study into the general nature \nof academic tribes and territories. To do this they concentrated on \u201cthe epistemological \nproperties of knowledge formation [territories] \u2026. [and] the social aspects of knowledge \ncommunities [tribes]\u201d (p. 24). The first two parts of this section follow this division. \nAcademic Territories \nAcademic territory refers to the epistemological nature of the field and relevant here are \nthe part of Becher and Trowler\u2019s study that highlighted disciplinarity, the content of the \nfield (its canon), whether the field contains hard or soft knowledge (paradigm questions) \nand the mode of enquiry. Each of those aspects of academic territory is now investigated \nin turn. \nDisciplinarity \nTribe\u2019s (1997) analysis established criteria to settle the question of disciplinary status and \nconcluded that tourism studies was unable to pass this test. Rather it was found to be a \nfield, or more specifically, two fields of study, labelled TF1 (The Business of Tourism) \nand TF2 (Non-Business related Tourism). Knowledge creation occurred, according to \nTribe, by multi-disciplinary, interdisciplinary and extra-disciplinary efforts. Here, extra-\ndisciplinary knowledge means that which is pulled from the complexity of the problem \nbeing studied rather than pushed from the prevailing disciplines.  There was however no \nempirical evidence offered in support of this thesis, an omission that this article will \naddress. In doing so it will also evaluate two later contributions to the literature. Coles et \nal. (2009, p. 87)  conceptualise tourism more as a post-disciplinary area of study which \n\u201callows scholars to free themselves from the intellectual shackles applied by disciplinary \npolicing \u2026 encourag[ing] the valorization of knowledge produced elsewhere.\u201d Similarly, \nHannam (2009) suggests the replacement of tourism studies by nomadology and the \nmobilities paradigm. Nomadology describes an even more radical deterritoralisation of \nthe academic where as Deleuze and Guattari (1988, p.52) note \u201cthe nomad has no point, \npaths or land\u201d. \n \nThe almost unanimous describing of tourism as a field rather than a discipline by the \ninformants provides compelling empirical evidence to support Tribe\u2019s (1997) \n\u201cindiscipline\u201d thesis: \n#26 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: Tourism Studies is a field. It is still fragmented. \n#23 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: It is a field of study for different disciplines. I see just partial cohesion. \nSimilarly, Tribe\u2019s conceptualisation of two sub-fields (although not identified as TF1 and \nTF2) and evidence of considerable fragmentation found widespread support: \n#11 Y\/M\/J\/W\/LD: It\u2019s fragmented because the management is studied, about his perspective \nand the philosophy too, and the social scientist too. \n#20 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: Tourism studies to me is a field \u2026 [dominated by] mainly economics, \nbusiness management, and to some extent sociology and geography \n#56 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: [two] fields, the business-driven and cultural critique-driven \nAnd, like Tribe, some informants saw benefits in its lack of disciplinarity: \n#8 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 it\u2019s a field but one of the things that I like about it is that people bring \ndisciplinary issues with them to the study of Tourism \u2026 so that we do have a wonderful \ncollection of diverse ways of attacking questions or problems coming in from various \nexisting fields. \nThere was one contrary view and one caveat expressed: \n#13 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 because it gets much more volume, much more attention in the academic \nworld, in universities, and I think it might be viewed more as a discipline than as a research \nfield. \n#11 Y\/M\/J\/W\/LD: I think it\u2019s a field.  But \u2026 it can change to be a discipline. \n \nIt is interesting to note that none of the informants used the terms post-disciplinary or \nnomadology during the course of the interviews although one informant talked of the \nemergence of mobilities. \nThe Canon \nThe extent of recorded knowledge about a subject is known as the canon and one \ninformant suggests that the canon of tourism studies is quite fully formed. \n#37 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: Thirty years (1974\u20132004) of concentrated analysis \u2026 have generated a vast \nbody of data, theories, methodologies, and so-called best practices, which suggests that the \nbasics of tourism have been largely identified and described (Nash, 2007, p. 196). \nBut the main argument used by Tribe to assert his \u201cindiscipline\u201d claim was the lack of \ntourism theory. Again, many of the informants supported this view: \n#63 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: It easily blurs into other areas; no unique jargon, language or theories other \nthan in a superficial sense. \n#60 O\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 it borrows, as it should, concepts and terminology from established \ndisciplines and discourses. Examples are terms such as carrying capacity, sustainable \ndevelopment \u2026 tourist-gaze... \n#38 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 there aren\u2019t really any tourism theories \u2013 maybe TALC comes near, but \nthat\u2019s not really unique to tourism. \n#56 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 As for unique theories, I do not think it has them \u2026 \n \nBut a number of informants were able to identify some key and distinctive characteristics, \ne.g: \n#23 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: Archer (demand forecasting); Cohen (sociology of tourism); Christaller \n(tourism location); Leiper (ditto); Butler (life cycle); Plog (psychographics in tourism); Gunn \n(planning); Ritchie and Crouch and Dwyer (competitiveness); Pearce (environment and \ntourism development); Poon (new tourism); Crompton (destination choice); Tourism and \nICTs studies; pull and push factors approaches \u2026 \n#61 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: in tourism we may talk of performativity, the gaze, embodiment, \nhost\/guest, \u2018other\u2019 which have their roots in other disciplines but we are making them our \nown in different ways.  \n#21 O\/F\/S\/W\/D Yes, it does have its own jargon \u2026 For example, those relating to tourist \ntypologies etc.  The same is true of theories \u2013 yes we do have some of our own. \n \nSo some informants can see tourism theory whilst others cannot. Barnes (2001, p. 527) \noffers a way to understand this apparent paradox. He explains how \u201ctheoretical change \nproceeds through a process of what [the Edinburgh school] call finitism \u2026 [where] new \ntheories typically stem from extending existing concepts in one field to new \ncircumstances.\u201d  This idea is neatly captured by two informants who note that: \n#55 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 tourism studies borrow[s] theories and concepts from other fields, but \nwhen tossed into the tourism studies cauldron, these ideas can yield something different and \ndistinctive\u2026 \n#23 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 tourism \u2026 is a field of study, meaning that it mainly applies \ntheories\/methodologies and languages of other disciplines in producing knowledge. However \nit is in a transition phase: from \u2018simple\u2019 application of borrowed theories \u2026 towards an \nunderstanding of specific factors making \u2018general\u2019 theories not sufficient (I think we are \nhere) \u2026 leading to a need of some unique theories\/methodologies. \nIndeed this confirms the point made by Tribe (1997, p. 643) who argued that: \ntourism studies can, in fact parade a number of concepts \u2026 for example \u2026 the tourism \nmultiplier \u2026 [but] \u2026 they are concepts that have started life elsewhere and have been \nstretched or contextualised to give them a tourism dimension. \n \nThe process of finitism in tourism studies is likely to continue with the field embracing \nand adapting theories from its contributory disciplines and neighbouring fields since the \nboundaries of tourism studies are made of porous rather than solid membranes.   \nParadigms \nBecher and Trowler used the terms hard vs. soft knowledge (Biglan, 1973) where the \nformer refers to the existence of a paradigm. For Kuhn (1962) a paradigm is set of rules \nthat govern what is to be researched and how this should be conducted and presented. So \nthe existence of a paradigm could lead to the suppression and exclusion of new \nknowledge. Overall the informants reject the notion of a governing paradigm pointing to \ntourism studies as \u201csoft\u201d knowledge: \n#2 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: I actually don\u2019t feel that there is [a paradigm] \u2026 There are people who have \ntaken tourism in a certain direction, but I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s too restrictive.  I think it\u2019s emerged in \na bit of a free form, sort of way\u2026 \n#1 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: You could interchangeably ask tradition, paradigm, ideology, discourse - for \nme there\u2019s not one. \n#23 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: There is not a paradigm, maybe because paradigms tend to be more present \nin \u2018mature\u2019 sciences \u2026 Tourism is too young and the fact that it is connected to different \ndisciplines may make it more difficult to arrive to a paradigm. \n \nSome informants identified competing perspectives and there was disagreement about \nwhich was dominant. Some found positivism \/ managerialism dominant: \n#63 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: The curriculum and programmes have developed from a \nmanagerial\/positivist position and these still tend to have a dominant position.  \n#51 O\/M\/J\/NW\/LD: \u2026 the field is still very much dominated by positivist\/post-positivist \nparadigms, although the call for (or voice of) constructivist\/interpretivist perspectives is \ngetting louder \u2026 \n#3 Y\/M\/J\/W\/D: It is very much a business related \u2026 very quantitative, very numbers driven. \nStill others found that positivism \/ managerialism was being squeezed out:  \n#63 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: The research is no longer dominated by managerialism and positivism, \nindeed it may have turned its back too vehemently against these approaches.  \n#49 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 tourism as an industry or from a positive business development \nperspective seems to get less exposure \u2026 \n \nThis apparent paradox may be explained by the situatedness, or discursive networks of \nthe informant: \n#56 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: It depends what field you work in, what seems to be the dominant discourse. \nIt is difficult even to picture it as \u201cone field\u201d, due to the different discourses people speak \nwhen speaking of tourism. \nThe strength of the Foucauldian (1971) idea of discourse is illustrated by the struggles of \ninformant 12 against what is seen as a prevalent (taken for granted) discourse: \n#12 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 when I talk to my department \u2026 about issues of gender I\u2019m \nautomatically labelled as a feminist \u2026  When he talks about any general topic, he actually \ntalks about it from a very masculine point of view \u2026  He actually talks about colonial man \ntravelling the world and whatever but he just presents this as a part of travel history.  So, his \ndiscourse is normalised, mine is not.  \n \nSome informants looked beyond the \u201crules\u201d of the field pointing to the Gramscian notion \nof ideology to identify a broader, societal disciplining effect at work: \n#12 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D:\u2026 the dominant ideology is a neo-liberal business ideology \u2026 \n#55 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D:  Scientism, capitalism, neo-liberalism, materialism, individualism. These \naren\u2019t the only ideas out there, but they\u2019re the hegemonic ones. \n \nThe idea of a fluid field, mobility of knowledge and an emerging paradigm of mobilities \nwas introduced by one informant: \n#61 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: The wonderful thing about tourism is that it is in a constant state of \nmovement \u2026 I would say at the moment the dominant paradigms emerging are the mobilities \nparadigm, the shift towards critical and cultural thinking. \n \nIn summary the idea of a paradigm is not supported by the informants. Rather their \nevidence points to a soft, permeable field comprised of different traditions (MacIntyre, \n1985) which, unlike a paradigm-ruled field, can coexist and are susceptible to new \nschools of thought. \nMode \nBecher and Trowler also studied the distinction between pure and applied knowledge. \nPure knowledge is highly abstract whereas applied knowledge is closely aligned with real \nworld problem solving. This division is related to the distinction between different modes \nof knowledge \u2013 mode 1 being that which is generated from within the academy and mode \n2 being that which is extradisciplinary and arising from and focussed on applied contexts \n(Gibbons et al., 1994). Despite the apparent \u201creal world\u201d focus of the field a number of \ninformants pointed to limited evidence of applied research: \n#66 Y\/M\/J\/W\/D: [What is overlooked is] real change through engagement with industry. I \nthink we have got too set in our own ways and comfort zone\u2026. My intention is to change \nindustry practice \u2026 using academic rigour to do so. \n#25 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: I also think many academics tend to concentrate on the \u201cphilosophy\u201d \ninstead of more actively seeking solutions, i.e. not very pragmatic.  \n#46 O\/F\/J\/W\/D: I do question who reads [tourism] journal articles and what, other than for \npromotion, is the point in publishing in this forum (Ateljevic et al., 2007, p. 397). \nAcademics Tribes \nAn analysis of academic tribes in tourism focuses on the cultural practices of academics \nand the social construction of knowledge. This section uses the work of Merton\u2019s (1973) \nsociology of science, Becher and Trowler (2001), Barnes\u2019 (2001) analysis of economic \ngeography, and Tribe (2006, p. 376) who noted that: \nthe canon of knowledge is heavily contingent on the power of those who speak for tourism, \ntheir spatial and temporal situatedness and the social practices that sustain their position and \nauthority. \nBarnes (2001) notes how Merton\u2019s (1973) concept of Institutionalism challenged the \nnotion of disinterested knowledge by analysing the social side of knowledge creation and \ninvestigating the induction of scientists into their disciplines. Institutionalism describes \nthe processes by which norms are set out for new areas of study especially in terms of \nwhat is to be studied, how it is to be studied and indeed who is to be central to studying it. \nThis section investigates the institutions of universities and how these and other factors \naffect academic freedom. It then considers how cultural aspects (specifically clans and \nelders) and wider societal cultural values act upon tourism knowledge.  \nUniversities and Departments  \nAcademics cluster in formal academic groupings and are institutionalised within \ndepartments in universities. Tribe (2006, p. 371-372) used the term \u2018\u2018departmentalism\u2019\u2019 \nto describe the organisational effects of universities on research noting that \u201cthese \nstructures have immense power to direct time, supply funds and corral research to fit a \nparticular faculty strategy.\u201d \n \nBeing situated in a university can be a source of intellectual stimulation and freedom: \n#36 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: [I] started studying \u2026 at the newly opened University of Vincennes, where \nso many of the most famous intellectual luminaries of the time were teaching\u2014such as \nFoucault, Deleuze, Lyotard, and Bourdieu \u2026 (Nash, 2007, p. 167-168). \nBut many informants are conscious of institutional socialisation: \n#40 Y\/M\/J\/W\/D: We learnt and played this new fangled game \u2026 (Ateljevic et al., 2007, p. \n388). \nAnd others recognized departments as places to be carefully negotiated: \n#50 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: My encounters with the excesses of empirical realist (bean counting) \naccounts of social science occurred at Texas A and M University (Botterill, 2003, p. 100). \n#35 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: [I found myself] in the middle of the fight between combatants, which \ninvolved those (mostly Marxists) increasingly radicalized by the Vietnam war, and the \nbiologically oriented wing of the department and their associates. \u2026 I took sparingly from \nthe Marxist view of things and struggled to remain autonomous \u2026 (Nash, 2007, p. 156,157). \n \nMany informants discuss the influence of departments: \n#67 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: the discourse varies substantially depending upon where the \nprogram\/faculty member is housed.  In the US, the primary focus is the \u201cbusiness of \ntourism;\u201d however, many faculty in geography, sociology and anthropology that study \ntourism focus on a variety of issues not directly related to the industry of tourism. \n#2 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: if you\u2019re in a business school the way that you\u2019re thinking is much more \nbusiness oriented. \n#28 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: Parsonian structural functionalism \u2026 dominated the theoretical approach \nin the Department at the time \u2026 [which was] under the sway of a few eminent scholars \u2026 \nThere was a general sense among the younger staff that their professional future depended \nupon close collaboration with their seniors \u2026 This engendered a considerable degree of \ndependency, stifling to some extent the quest for an independent choice of topics (Nash, \n2007, p. 52-53). \nAnd sometimes there can be an explicit agenda for fitting in: \n#28 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 their seniors \u2026 directed them toward specific research topics (Nash, \n2007, p. 53). \n#7 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: in my university \u2026 they\u2019re saying these are the streams that we\u2019re going to \nbe supporting for research. And obviously business and management is one of the streams. \nSo, if you\u2019re not necessarily doing anything that is business or management related, you \nreally have to fight to make a strong case to get any sort of support for it, because it\u2019s not \nwithin the remit. \nFitting in presented difficulties for some: \n#52 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: I felt often alone as a qualitative, gender-based researcher in a discipline \nwhere objectivity, generalisation and distance were the norm. I understood the tenets of \nscientific objectivity and quantitative research, as this was the paradigm which influenced my \nundergraduate studies, and struggled to justify to myself and others how I could adequately \ndo a qualitative PhD (Ateljevic et al., 2005, p. 15). \n#43 O\/F\/J\/W\/D: Initially when confronted with such challenges from those that appeared not \nto understand and\/or have sympathies with my particular perspective or world view, it was \neasier to retreat and sit in the shadows hoping that no one would notice what I was doing \n(Ateljevic et al., 2007, p. 392). \n \nThe informants are painting a mixed picture here \u2013 there is much talk about institutional \nsocialisation, sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit with some struggling against \ndepartmental norms. This opens up an interesting area of research freedom which is \ninvestigated in the next section. \nFreedom to Research  \nA number of informants viewed themselves as free agents in research: \n#11 Y\/M\/J\/W\/LD: \u2026 we don\u2019t have limits.  Each person can investigate whatever he \nlikes. \n#38 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 free to research what I want. \n#8 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: I\u2019ve never felt any constraint \n#23 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: Free. \nOne informant explained that tourism studies offers liberation from the \u2018tyranny of the \ndisciplines\u2019 (Aronowitz & Giroux, 1991)  where disciplines can impose restraining rules \non how to conduct research: \n#35 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: I have found something like a home in tourism studies and a good deal of \nfreedom \u2026 which comes from being at a distance from disciplinary mainstreams (Nash, \n2007, p. 165-166). \nInformant 67 demonstrates a critically reflexive view of freedom pointing to cultural \n\u201cbaggage\u201d and self-surveillance (Foucault, 1980) as constraints: \n#67 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: I am pretty much able to define what I see as important within the context \nof tourism.  However, I am not certain what \u201cfree\u201d means.  I have the \u201cbaggage\u201d of the way I \nsee the world, my perceptions of responsibilities to the university, my students and more \ngenerally to the field. \nSelf-surveillance (as opposed to external coercion) can limit absolute freedom where \nacademic actors avoid certain radical moves that might take them outside of a broad \nscript that is officially (both implicitly and explicitly) legitimized.  \n \nFunding is a major constraint. \u201cNo money, no proof\u201d according to Lyotard (1984, p. 45) \nwho proposes the term performativity to describe the influence of research funding on \ntruth, explaining that  \u201c\u2026 whoever is wealthiest has the best chance of being right\u201d. \nMany informants report funding agencies influencing which truth areas are investigated: \n#60 O\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 more than ever before, universities are funding industry oriented \nresearch. \n#21 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: My research is heavily influenced by whatever contract research I am \nengaged with, research council bids. \n#34 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 the majority of tourism research is performative. \n#55 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 the tourism cannon is unbalanced in favor of research that is marketable. \n \nThe Sustainable Tourism Co-operative Research Centre in Australia (STCRC) is quoted \nas an example of this: \n#3 Y\/M\/J\/W\/D: The research agenda I would like to follow was dictated pretty heavily by the \nCRC tourism. \n#2 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: In Australia \u2026 the CRC has taken the view of consulting with industry and \nthen setting a research agenda based upon industry rather than upon the researchers. \nOne informant directly stated that funding and publishing regimes constrained her \nresearch agenda: \n#7 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 because of the sort of constraints of who is going to fund this kind of \nwork and where am I going to get it published, then I think that that is a constraint on the \nthings that I sometimes do. \nLyotard (1984, p. 46) noted that in some cases \u201cscientists, technicians and instruments are \npurchased not to find truth but to augment power\u201d. On informant found himself \nembroiled in this kind of truth selectivity: \n#66 Y\/M\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 funding sources that want to promote positive messages have \nconstrained what I say or publish. \n \nBut unlike say nuclear physics, much tourism research is cheap and this enables some \nresearchers to maintain independent agendas: \n#29 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: My twenty-year contribution to the anthropology of tourism has been based \non a grand total of only $800 in research funding (Nash, 2007, p. 72). \n#55 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: My work is pretty low-cost \u2026 so I\u2019m able to keep it going despite not \nhaving an external source of funding. \n#54 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 what most people do is continue the work that is near and dear to their \nhearts while developing a similar, \u2018sexier\u2019 more marketable line of research from which they \ncan successful obtain funding.  \n \nA second major issue that was raised as a constraining issue on research freedom was the \nneed to publish in certain journals: \n#26 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 if you want to be promoted, then your research interests might be \nconstrained due to publication requests from your employers. \n#64 O\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 the emphasis is strongly on publishing in the top-tier journals. \n#20 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 many academic journals define their boundaries and it only seems \nappropriate to research within those boundaries\u2026 \n \nFinally it appears that older, well-established researchers have more freedom as \nevidenced by the different perspectives of informants 40 (younger) and 8 (older): \n#40 Y\/M\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 I realised that academia, for all its promise of unbounded exploration, is \nan act of joining the dots, playing the game \u2026 (Ateljevic et al., 2007, p. 387) \n#8 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: if you know that somebody\u2019s going to be looking at the quality of the \njournal that you\u2019re publishing in, you have to put a couple of articles in one of those journals. \nBut, once you\u2019ve done that \u2026 then it\u2019s much more fun to publish in a place where there is \ninnovation, good ideas, things happening \u2026 \nClans \nA useful insight into academic culture is provided by Crane (1972) who identified the \noperation of \u2018invisible colleges\u2019. These include the meetings and associations where key \nacademic groups cultivate their tribal territories but whose operation might not be \ntransparent to everyone who operates in the field. There are many meetings and \nassociations in tourism but one which bears some investigation is the International \nAcademy for the Study of Tourism (IAST) often referred to as \u201cThe Academy\u201d. It is \ncertainly invisible to many: \nIV: Have you heard about The Academy of Tourism?  \n#6 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: No. \n#13 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: No. \n#2 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: Not really, no. \n#3 Y\/M\/J\/W\/D:  Very vaguely \u2026 That seems to be an elite.  I am not quite sure what they \ndo, I am not sure what kind of role that they play. \nIndeed its lack of transparency leads one informant to talk about it secret society terms: \n#7 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: It\u2019s just like there is this elite group of people who belong to this Academy \n\u2026 Who are these people and how do you get on it? Is this by invitation only? What does it \ndo? \u2026 \u2026 it\u2019s a secret society \u2026 you don\u2019t know what goes on in it. You don\u2019t know how to \nget in there. So, that\u2019s why I say it\u2019s like a lodge. \n \nThe literature suggests that The Academy might exert a role in normalising (Kuhn, 1962) \ntourism studies and legitimising certain parts of the canon: \n#16 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 there is a clique \u2026 in the academy - there\u2019s a group there that filled \nmany of the editorial boards \u2026 So I think there is a group that has substantial influence on \nthe way the field unfolds.  \n#9 O\/F\/J\/W\/D: I see The Academy as a group of old guys \u2026 There are about five or six \nwomen and about 77 members. \u2026 They think they have a lot of influence. I think they do \nhave a fair amount of influence in terms of having been gatekeepers to journals, etc. \n#12 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: [The Academy] was apparently quite an elitist society \u2026 and it is invitation-\nonly based and it definitely comes from that old guard which \u2026 wanted to give this scientific \nstatus to the Academy.   \nAnd invisible colleges can be a force for knowledge conservatism: \n#15 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: \u2026it is important to be aware of how the power structures work and how \nthey exercise as well.  And my concern in that regard would be that it perhaps inhibits new \nthinking, creative ways of writing\u2026 \nOf course conservatism can sometimes lead to ossification: \n#1 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 look at the last two academy meetings; it\u2019s two years and they haven\u2019t \nproduced the book from The Academy meeting yet. So that ability to transmit that \ninformation to people is really lost. \n#5 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: [Professor Z] has been staying with us the last week, and he's been talking \nabout the Tourism Academy and saying, well, what a waste of space.  \n \nThere was some discussion about the gender and ethnic balance of The Academy: \n#16 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 it really struck me as an old boys\u2019 club and I think that\u2019s problematic.  \n#17 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 clearly there\u2019s a very strong Anglo-Saxon male bias.   \n#15 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: It\u2019s less than ten women \u2026 Ethnically, it\u2019s pretty Caucasian. \nIt appears that there are signs of change in The Academy: \n#16 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 it seems that it has broadened and it has embraced newer people in more \nrecent times \u2026Over the last handful of years it seems to have \u2026 changed. \n#9 O\/F\/J\/W\/D: [its influence] is being challenged and is changing, I think. \nAnd the maleness of invisible colleges such as The Academy has generated resistance \n(Foucault, 1980) with female academics creating their own colleges such as SWIG: \nIV: Which [academic associations] do you belong to? \n#9 O\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 I belong \u2026 to SWIG, the Society for Women Geographers \u2026  \nElders \nAcademic esteem can arise from objective measures such as citation counts (McKercher, \n2008) but a social line also marks off the \u201celders\u201d of the tribes so that a distinction can be \nmade between an old and new guard. Barnes (2001) points out how hierarchical positions \nin the academy can result from the \u2018cumulative effects\u2019 of being a subject pioneer and \nfrom the \u2018halo effect\u2019 of affiliation to elite institutions. Informant 13 alludes to this \npioneer effect: \n#13 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 if you are looking at old school tourism researchers, you could obviously \nput Cohen, Urry, Butler all in the same group \u2026 it probably has some power from it being \nolder, but if you think about it, it\u2019s the people who might be the pioneers of tourism \nresearchers.  I think they\u2019re like the guardian angels of tourism. \nFor some the old guard is also \u2018the old boys\u2019 club\u2019: \n#61 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 Old guard remain in place in business-focused tourism research \u2026 \ncertainly still legacies of the \u2018old boy\u2019s club\u2019.  \n \nFollowing Kuhn (1962) we might surmise that the old guard could be resistant to change: \n#21 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: Yes, I think there is [an old guard] \u2026 One consequence may be that things \nare slow to change \u2026 \n#3 Y\/M\/J\/W\/D: I think what is frustrating is there is a lot of the same people on every \neditorial board.  There is no other new guard on those whatsoever \u2026 \nInformant 18 alludes to the power of patronage of the old guard: \n#18 O\/F\/J\/NW\/D: In India \u2026 the old guard continues to exert its influence on the new guard, \nmost of who need them for sustenance. \nIn China a clear division of old and new guard was drawn: \n#10 O\/M\/S\/NW\/LD: \u2026 for the old professors they may study tourism studies \u2026 from \nPolitical Economics and these kind of things, but some youngsters they might be graduated \nor training in foreign countries \u2026 and now there\u2019s more and more coming back to be \nmembers of the faculty which tries to do things, new things. This kind of time they have two \nlayers of the professors or the academics. Young ones and the old traditional ones. \n \nBut criticism of the old guard was matched by praise: \n#59 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 experiences of \u2018old guard\u2019 very positive in that I have found many to be \nextremely helpful, generous and forthcoming \u2026 \n#61 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: I have not experienced obvious inequality of access \u2026 \nThere was also an observation which linked cognitive to the social: \n#54 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: Perhaps the fact that it is field (numerous in-roads) as opposed to a \ndiscipline (one way highway) reduces the hegemonic influence of the old guard. \n \nThe new guard are seen as a sign of fresh blood, optimism and many were keen to \nassociate themselves with this term: \n#34 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: There is certainly a new and old guard mentality and I definitely belong to \nthe \u2018new guard\u2019. \n#60 O\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 a vibrant new-guard \u2026 [is] taking over, a very healthy and encouraging \nsign. \n  #54 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D \u2026 as more scholars have been inducted into the field, bringing with them \nnovel approaches, the old boys club is slowly being rendered obsolete.  \n \nBut some concern was raised about the new guard and what Pearce (2005) termed \n\u201cgeneration T\u201d (tourism, rather traditional discipline-based, graduates): \n#2 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: I feel the field is still a little bit weak.  I think part of it is the whole issue that \nPhil Pearce just called it a new generation T and I tend to agree a little bit with that. \n#15 O\/F\/S\/W\/D \u2026 Old guard to me, the tradition is a little more rigid, but they do bring the \nstrong disciplinary background. The new guard and the new guard behind us, I\u2019m worried \nthat we\u2019re going to be watered down into the tourism people, hospitality people. \n#16 O\/M\/S\/W\/D \u2026 with the newer people coming through, it\u2019s not a tie to a traditional \ndiscipline in many cases \u2026 and I think that\u2019s a real problem. \nWider Cultural Aspects \nIt is not just the immediate academic culture that impinges upon the practices of \nacademics but also the wider cultural milieu in which they work. Here the cultural studies \nof science literature provides pointers for analysis of issues such as gender, race, class, \nvalues and geographical location. Donna Haraway underlined the importance of these \nissues by coining the expression \u2018the gaze from nowhere\u2019 (Haraway, 1991, p. 188), which \nshe used to critique the assumed objectivity of science. Knowledge rather emanates from \nsomewhere, from someone, from embodied researchers who carry with them acquired \ncultural blueprints for action. These are not identical across researchers so researchers in \ndifferent cultures may be interested in and produce different knowledge. The effects of \nthis are neatly summarised by Barnes (2001, p. 540): \nscience is embedded within complex sets of social relations that variously shape its \ninstitutional form, rationale, practice, and knowledge. Because such social relations are \nalways specific to a local context \u2026 science studies argues that science [is] always relative to \nthe geographical and historical context in which it takes place. \nTribe (2006, p. 375) echoed this theme noting that, \ntourism research carries with it a subtle power to define: to skew: to objectify: to foreground \nsome issues leaving others untouched. \n \nIn relation to this, informants identified under-researched areas pointing to four key  \n\u201csilences\u201d. The most discussed was that of \u201cother knowledges\u201d which appear to be \noverlooked because of a culture of ethnocentrism: \n#12 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: It\u2019s definitely issues of other knowledge, knowledge that\u2019s coming from \nother cultures [that is overlooked]. \n#18 O\/F\/J\/NW\/D: Tourism studies is \u2026 guided largely by occidental perceptions and \nphilosophies. Few scholarly works from the oriental mindsets are known \/ available. \n#5 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: We haven't really talked at all about indigenous knowledge or indigenous \nscience, if such a thing exists. \n But there was also talk of resistance (Foucault, 1980) to this: \n#9 O\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 you, of course, are also so totally colonised by western perspective and yet \nthere\u2019s a fair amount of influential resistance to that and a desire to more indigenised thinking \nfrom the cultural perspective.  So I think there\u2019s hope for a multi-cultural tourism culture. \n \nThe second area where a thinness of research was reported was that of under-empowered \ngroups, particularly the situation of minorities: \n#26 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 less developed countries; females; disabled people [are overlooked]. \n#54 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: Unabashedly, I\u2019ll say that we have yet to award sufficient attention to \nissues of race and ethnicity.   \n#6 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 not much on obviously ethnic minorities \u2026 Not just ethnic minorities, \nany kind of small social groups for example.  \n#12 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: The different issues of woman empowerment, generally empowerment of all \nmarginalised groups \u2026 \n \nThe third area that was identified was that of power and politics: \n#7 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: I don\u2019t think that the sort of politics of tourism is as much focused on as it \nshould be, and when I talk about politics I\u2019m talking about issues of power. \n#1 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: The big business end of decision making in tourism, which is enormously \npowerful \u2026 but we don\u2019t really study them \u2026 Similarly, we don\u2019t study the very rich. \n#56 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: I would say social politics and policy, and work and labour, are under-\nresearched. \n \nFourth, quality of life and the more spiritual, humanistic side of tourism was seen as a \nlacuna: \n#55 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: There is far too little research on how tourism contributes to the world\u2019s \nproblems and how it could better be used serve the public good and to increase quality of life \nfor people who are currently underprivileged. \n#15 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: The whole, the almost spiritual content of what tourism can be, the \ntransformational aspect of what tourism can be, is understated because it\u2019s not scientific.  So \n\u2026 the huge power that tourism has to change humanity that we haven\u2019t tapped into yet \u2026 \n#12 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: \u2026 looking at tourism as a form of regional development that can potentially \nlead to that harmony between nature, economy and quality of life.  \n \nFinally for some academics the canon was complete and comprehensive (but it is \ninteresting to note the profiles of both of these respondents):  \n#63 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: I am not sure that anything fundamental now is overlooked. \n#38 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: I can\u2019t think of anything that is overlooked. \nAcademic Networks \nWhilst the division between tribes and territories provides for analytical clarity, in reality \nthere is much blurring and interconnectedness of tribes and territories. With this in mind \nthis third section turns to actor-network theory (ANT) to uncover novel relationships \ncirculating between tribes and territories and provide a new understanding of the field, \nespecially the process by which it is constantly reconfigured. Using ANT, tourism studies \nis conceptualized and analyzed in terms of actors and a series of overlapping networks \nthat are in constant flux - circulating, becoming, dissolving, merging and demerging. \nAccording to Law (1999, p. 3) \u201centities take their form and acquire their attributes as a \nresult of their relationships with other entities.\u201d It is possible therefore to see an academic \nknowledge area as a series of networks (Barnes, 2001) which consist of entities that are \nrelated to one another. Meaning for these entities is produced by relations with other \nentities in the network each of which in ANT is referred to as an actor. \n \nA number of aspects of ANT can be used to understand the working of knowledge areas. \nFirst ANT takes us beyond the social in that it encompasses non-human as well as human \ninfluences (the ANT principle of symmetry). In a tourism studies network these might \ninclude material and non-material entities including books, technologies and institutions. \nThis broadening of scope is important and Latour (2005, p. 72) explains how not only \nhumans but also things as actors \u201cmight authorize, allow, afford, encourage, permit, \nsuggest, influence, block, render possible, forbid and so on.\u201d  \n \nSecond, after Callon (2001, p. 64), tourism studies can be viewed as something that \n\u201cmust be composed, made up, constituted, established, maintained and assembled\u201d and \nANT has developed a number of concepts to explain the construction, extension and \nperpetuation of networks. \u2018Problematisation\u2019 is the articulation of the problem, or group \nof problems, that needs to be worked on and an initial scoping of the network and \nrelevant actors. \u2018Interessement\u2019 is the process of mobilising the interest of actors and \nnegotiating the basis of their involvement in networks. Actors who perform organising \nroles are termed \u2018primary actors\u2019. Primary actors may establish themselves as \u2018obligatory \npassage points\u2019 that intermediate between actors and networks or provide essential points \nof reference. \u2018Enrolment\u2019 to a network occurs when actors assume the roles that have \nbeen negotiated with them during interessement. \u201c \u2018Translation\u2019 involves creating \nconvergences and homologies by relating things that were previously different\u201d (Callon, \n1980, p. 211) and therefore identifies new entities and relations. \u2018Inscription\u2019 is the way \nin which for example translations are \u201cembodied in texts, machines, bodily skills [and \nthese] become their support, their more or less faithful executive\u201d (Callon, 1991, p. 143). \nLaw (1992, p. 387) points out the importance of durable inscriptions so that \u201ca relatively \nstable network is one embodied in and performed by a range of durable materials\u201d. \nNetwork Formation \nAirey (2005) traces the roots of tourism studies as far back as Rae (1891) but notes that \nearly forays into the subject are relatively fragmented. This section illustrates the \nimportant process of consolidation and growth through network formation by reference to \nthe development of two exemplar established networks (tourism social science and the \nbusiness of tourism) and the emergence of a new network (critical tourism). It was the \nAmerican Anthropological Association [AAA] that provided an existing network from \nwhich a significant network in tourism was established and the AAA meeting in Mexico \nCity 1974 illustrates the process of  interessement at work: \n#37 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 in 1974 I inserted a notice in the Newsletter of the American \nAnthropological Association, which asked in essence, \u201c Is anyone else interested in the study \nof tourism?\u201d \u2026 [This led to the AAA Meeting in Mexico City 1974 where] \u2026everyone \nseemed to feel that we, in one day, had opened the door to a new field of research with vast \nimplications. The spirit of innovation, almost magical in form, filled the air (Nash, 2007, p. \n185). \nOne informant describes this as: \n#31 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: Valene Smith\u2019s epic AAA meeting (Nash, 2007, p. 103). \nThrough this meeting it can be seen how informant #37 becomes a primary actor, and \npoint of translation: \n#32 O\/M\/S\/NW\/D: [Valene Smith] \u2026 has done the most to introduce the social sciences and \ntourism to one another. Much of the multidisciplinary strength in tourism research we \nwitness today is due to her pathmaking initiatives (Nash, 2007, p. 117). \n \nFurthermore a number of academics were enrolled into this network and the business of \ntranslation got underway as people and things that were working and being worked upon \nin different disciplines began to converge in an emerging field: \n#37 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: When I made the announcement of the Symposium, I found that there were \n28 fellow anthropologists, as well as geographers, sociologists, and economists who agreed \nthat it was time to talk tourism! (Nash, 2007, p. 192). \n#37 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: We soon learned also that Charles Goeldner had started the Journal of \nTravel Research, Jafar Jafari was pioneering Annals of Tourism Research and Tej Vir Singh \nwas preparing to launch Tourism Recreation Research. Together, we had taken important \nsteps in founding a field (Nash, 2007, p. 192). \nMexico City turns out to have been a popular place for network formation and a starting \npoint for the eventual establishment of RC-50, the specialist tourism committee of the \nInternational Sociological Association: \n#30 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 I joined and attended [a] session [of the International Sociological \nAssociation (ISA)] in Mexico City and soon discovered a couple of kindred spirits, notably \nMarie-Fran\u00e7oise Lanfant and Kryzstztof Przeclawski; and before long we began plotting the \ncreation of a separate tourism unit within the ISA (Nash, 2007, p. 81). \n \nAnd whilst network formation around the social science of tourism was occurring in the \nUSA a similar process of problematisation, interessement and enrolment around the \nbusiness of tourism was developing in the UK: \n#57 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: [Rik Medlik] then spent the next decade \u2026 consolidating the position of \nhospitality and tourism studies. This included the production of further books and scholarly \npapers; the initiation of two scholarly journals, the short lived HCIMA Review and the long-\nlived Tourism Management; \u2026 leadership of the group that set up the first professional body, \nthe Tourism Society, now in its 30th year; and sitting on and chairing numerous government \nand other committees (Airey, 2007, p. 1382). \nMedlik is identified as another primary actor: \n#57 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: In many respects he was the creator of tourism and hospitality studies. He \nstaked out the territory, he championed its importance and he provided its initial credibility  \n(Airey, 2007, p. 1381). \nThis network formation and consolidation performed an important role in advancing this \nnew field in the face of other hostile networks. So for example Medlik\u2019s extensive \nenrolment of allies into the business of tourism network meant that he was able to \ndevelop: \n#57 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 the first [UK] degree programme in Hotel and Catering Administration \n[University of Surrey] in 1966 \u2026 in the face of scepticism and hostility from a very \ntraditional academic community (Airey, 2007, p. 1381). \nSimilarly a burgeoning network was able to support Annals against hostile critique: \n#32 O\/M\/S\/NW\/D: \u2026 the advocacy-oriented players of the time did not receive [the Annals] \njournal sympathetically. But critical voices were gaining momentum and Annals started \nreceiving increasing attention within a small, mostly academic circle (Nash, 2007, p. 113). \nAnd a continuing process of interessement is exemplified by the enrolment of: \n#32 O\/M\/S\/NW\/D: \u2026 Eduardo Fayos-Sola who has now managed to firmly lodge tourism \nresearch and education in the structure of the World Tourism Organization (Nash, 2007, p. \n118). \nIn ANT terms both Smith and Medlik were offering new translations. For example Smith \nwas making the case that anthropology, geography, sociology, and economics could be \ngathered and translated into a tourism perspective.  \n \nMore recently, the critical tourism network is an example of a network under formation. \nIt demonstrates many of the classic ANT phases and the coming together of many \ndisparate entities \u201cwhich then by dint of hard labour, good rhetoric, propitious social and \nacademic contexts and useful machines and devices produce provisionally commensurate \nconnections\u201d (Barnes, 2001, p. 531). So, for example, a number of  articles (Hollinshead, \n1991; Tribe, 2001; Jamal & Everett, 2004; Higgins-Desbiolles, 2005) had introduced \naspects of critical theory to tourism but a conference in Dubrovnik in 2005 brought \ntogether some of these and other entities that had previously been disparate and \nunconnected. Reflecting on the Dubrovnik conference informant 44 saw its potential \nnetwork power: \n#44 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: Although we can find niches of support, networks and friends, could a sub-\ndiscipline [critical tourism studies] that not only builds on \u2026 such supportive networks but \ncomes from them, such that they are integral to its progression, offer some alternative \nontologies and epistemologies? (Ateljevic et al., 2007, p. 394). \nHard labour by a group of enthusiasts meant that Dubrovnik 2005 was followed by Split \n2007 where an atmosphere of dialogue and mutual support was evident: \n#54 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: My faith in tourism conferences was \u2026 renewed after attending last year\u2019s \n(2007) conference in Spilt, Croatia.  In all honesty I received more support there than ever \nbefore in my tourism career. \n#12 Y\/F\/J\/W\/D: we\u2019re just enjoying the buzz of being the second generation of tourism \nscholars. \nBut networks are all potentially precarious and relations need to be repeatedly 'performed' \nfor networks to be maintained.  For the critical network, Split was followed by Zadar \n2009 and the \u201ccritical turn\u201d has been inscribed in a durable \u201cimmutable mobile\u201d in the \nform of a book (Ateljevic et al., 2007) as well  journal special editions.  \nInscriptions \nBarnes (2001) explains the importance of books as mobile inscriptions and how they \nforge connections and extend networks. They are \u201cimmutable mobiles\u201d (Latour, 1987) \nthat is to say their message does not get corrupted as it travels and are therefore efficient \nin transmitting the message \u201cin order to make more allies \u2013 the name of the game in \nANT\u201d (Barnes, 2001, p. 528). As an example of their power Barnes (2001, p. 540) \nexplains how certain books \u201c\u2026 became an active component in the very invention and \nmaintenance of \u2026 a discipline\u201d. For tourism it is possible to discern key inscriptions that \nboth embody and continue to perform the field. For example on the business side \ninformants point to:  \n#57 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 the highly influential textbook Tourism: Past, present and future \n(Burkart & Medlik, 1974) (Airey, 2007, p. 1381-82). \n#49 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: \u2026 the first edition of the Cooper, Gilbert, Fletcher & Wanhill. \nWhilst on the social science side the following are cited: \n#24 O\/M\/J\/NW\/LD: Hosts and Guests: The Anthropology of Tourism \n#56 O\/F\/S\/W\/D The Tourist (MacCannell); The Tourist Gaze (Urry) \n#29 O\/M\/S\/W\/D The Golden Hordes (Turner and Ash) \u2026 (Nash, 2007, p. 67) \n#26 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: Cohen (1974, 1979). \n \nAdditionally, encyclopaedias by their very name press very hard to define a field and \nimpose authoritative readings: \n#24 O\/M\/J\/NW\/LD: Jafar Jafari\u2019s edited \u2018Encyclopaedia of Tourism\u2019. \nOne informant underlines the solidity of key immutable mobiles \n#8 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: there\u2019s a few solid pieces of work and they\u2019re still standing there as kind of \nbrutal obstacles to our future progress.  \nDiagrams too represent powerful inscriptions. Haraway (1996, p. 135) talks of  \u201cfetishism \nin the form of maps and figures\u201d and one respondent explains how Leiper\u2019s (1990) \nsystems model both describes and defines tourism studies: \n#64 O\/F\/J\/W\/D: Six of \u2026 nine major textbooks use Leiper\u2019s systems theory approach as \ntheir basic paradigm in which the content and structure is grounded. This illustrates the high \ndegree to which Leiper\u2019s theory is, tacitly or otherwise, disseminated among students of \ntourism and hospitality\u2026 \n \nAnnals, Tourism Management and the Journal of Travel Research are consistently cited \nby informants as the key journals of the field triangulating with the findings of \nMcKercher, Law and Lam (2006). They are key inscription devices whose \u201cimmutability \nand mobility allow for their geographical diffusion, permitting connections to be forged \nbetween quite different and geographically separated local communities.\u201d (Barnes, 2002, \np. 493). Indeed journals are a way in which network space can be easily compressed and \ncrumpled and networks overcome apparent barriers of geographical distance. \n \nHowever Barnes (2001, p. 532) also describes how books offer points of novel translation \nwhich \u201conce published and in circulation [are a] means to gather new allies, whether they \nbe students, university academic boards, or politicians. [They] became a point of passage, \noffering the possibility of translations, of drawing together entities that formerly seemed \nirreconcilable\u201d. So just as the above books provided some of the early network \ntranslations later books spawned new network spaces. For example: \n#49 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: Poon\u2019s (1993) text was a landmark, especially the parts on old and new \ntourism. \u2026 The Holidaymakers\u2019 was a ground breaking text \u2013 it was also good to read! \n#61 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: I see landmarks in tourism as those elements that pushed tourism away \nfrom its economic-focused existence. Thus, Britton\u2019s (1991) call for a more critical tourism \nresearch agenda, de Kadt\u2019s \u2018Passport to Development\u2019, Urry\u2019s tourist gaze 1990, \nMacCannell\u2019s \u2018Tourist\u2019, the critical and cultural turns, Butler\u2019s Life Cycle, new mobilities \nparadigm, first critical tourism conference in Croatia, first research body grants given where \n\u2018tourism\u2019 was the focus of the proposed projects (recognition in field), the birth of Tourist \nStudies journal \u2026 \nObligatory Passage Points \nANT speaks of the importance of obligatory passage points (Latour, 1987) where \n\u201canyone wanting to do anything in the discipline needs to make some reference to such \npoints if they are both to be taken seriously, and to do the things that they claim to do\u201d \n(Barnes, 2002, p. 494). Discussion of \u201cgatekeepers\u201d covered this point and informants 20 \nand 21 identify some of these obligatory passage points and question their influence of \nequality of access: \n#20 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 editor-in-chief and the editorial board of a journal publication and \nrecruitment panel for academic positions in higher education. Whether there is equality of \naccess through these gates remains debatable. \n#61 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 journals and access to knowledge being guarded by white, middle class \nmen in general.  \nInformant 16 talks of the physical manifestation of obligatory passage points with \nacademics \u201changing around\u201d these important figures:  \n#16 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: I\u2019ve seen the power groupies \u2026You see at all these places people who are \nperceived to have power and influence and a range of people hang around them because of \nthat \u2026 \n \nGatekeepers appear less important for established researchers but may block the paths of \nyounger or \u201cthird world\u201d academics: \nIV: Do you find yourself coming up against gate keepers in a negative way?   \n#2 O\/F\/S\/W\/D: No, I don\u2019t \u2026 I might have when I was younger and at a lower position.  \n#6 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D Sometimes I think as a new researcher, even though I know journals are all \npeer reviewed, it\u2019s quite difficult to get into that.  \n#24 O\/M\/J\/NW\/LD: There is a lot of urging and arguing that academics should not be \ndominated by Western thought and that articles from third world countries should be \nencouraged. But there is a bias in the minds of many editors of journals \u2026 So the answer is \nno, there is little equality of access. \n \nTwo informants explain how key journals constitute obligatory passage points and how \nthese therefore guide regimes of truth and establish dominant discourses (Foucault, 1971) \nin the field: \n#20 Y\/F\/J\/NW\/D: \u2026 the two most prestigious journals for disseminating the findings of \ntourism research continue to be the pioneers: Annals of Tourism Research and Journal of \nTravel Research \u2026 Yet the fact remains that not all that claims to be tourism research finds \nacceptability within these journals. \u2026 It means the defined limits of what can and what \ncannot be published in these journals constitute the regimes of truth through which tourism \nresearch is directly or indirectly governed. You either operate within these defined discourses \nand be in with a chance of getting published or perish. \n#16 O\/M\/S\/W\/D \u2026 JTR and Annals \u2026 had a very traditional academic board who were \nlooking at things in a particular way \u2026 if you\u2019ve got something that challenges the norm, \nthen it\u2019s unlikely to get through the process \u2026  \nBut the following explains how Annals challenged the conventional industry and \nquantitative obligatory passage points therefore extending the range of what could pass: \n#32 O\/M\/S\/NW\/D: I added the subtitle \u201cA Social Sciences Journal\u201d [to Annals]. With an \nobvious tendency to favor research for the sake of research, with or without immediate \napplications in the industry, Annals parted ways from the mainstreams of the time. \u2026 The \nthen-favored quantitative research methods that were often used in economic contributions to \ntourism research began to give way in Annals to the qualitative treatment of the subject as a \nsociocultural phenomenon (Nash, 2007, p. 113-114). \n \nInformant 8 argues that tourism gatekeepers are less stringent than in some other \ndisciplines: \n#8 O\/M\/S\/W\/D: I grew up inside of a very, very fusty old Sociology and Anthropology \nestablishment \u2026 and there was definitely a sense, you play the game according to their rules \nand then if you do, you\u2019re lucky if they let you in. I don\u2019t see that happening for the very \nreason that Tourism is much more diffuse and it doesn\u2019t have the kind of monolithic structure \nthat 1950s and 60s social sciences had. \n \nFinally, whilst taken for granted by Anglophone researchers the English language \noperates a difficult obligatory passage point for many researchers: \n#11 Y\/M\/J\/W\/LD: I think in the academy we forget about the people in marginal areas, like \npeople \u2026 that don\u2019t work with English \u2026  I think there is a group that don\u2019t have access.  \nConclusions \nThe conclusions fall into two major headings of new ways of understanding and a review \nof findings. Under the first heading this article applied the Becher and Trowler model to \ntourism studies. It enriched their analysis by invoking concepts such as post-\ndisciplinarity, ideology, discourse, surveillance, traditions, performativity and invisible \ncolleges. It additionally utilised actor network theory to integrate the previously separate \nepistemological and sociological approaches and better understand the power dynamics \nof tourism knowledge creation. Here it supports the views of Barnes (2001, p. 528-529) \nwho noted that \u201cholding a network together is power\u201d and of van der Duim (2007, p. 966) \nwho argues that \u201can appropriate point of departure for an analysis of power would be not \nagency but the social relations that constitute effective agency\u201d (i.e. the relations that are \nsurfaced by actor network theory). This article has demonstrated how effective agency in \nthe form of creating traditions of knowledge and indeed resisting and modifying these \ntraditions results from configuration and performance of effective sociotechnical \nnetworks.  \n \nThe review of findings is divided into the three categories of territories, tribes and \nnetworks. The territory of tourism studies is viewed not as a discipline but rather a \nfragmented field of study supporting Tribe\u2019s (1997) indiscipline thesis. It remains a \nlargely multidisciplinary endeavor with little reported use of post-disciplinarity, or even \nnomadology. Evidence also supports Tribe\u2019s portrayal of two major fields but these are \nmore widely understood as The Business of Tourism and Tourism Social Science rather \nthan Tribe\u2019s somewhat clumsy TF1 and TF2 fields. However Tribe\u2019s contention that The \nBusiness of Tourism is overrunning the field is refuted, indeed there is a surprising lack \nof evidence of applied, extra-disciplinary work. Moreover the social science network \nremains strong and other networks based around interpretative methods, sustainability \nand critical theory have established a footing.  This eclecticism is possible because \ntourism studies is not governed by a paradigm. Rather it is a soft, permeable field able to \nsupport different traditions which can coexist and which are susceptible to new schools of \nthought. However some point to the overarching paradigm of neo-liberalism disciplining \nhow the subject operates. The territorial map provided by the tourism canon reveals what \nBecher and Trowler (2001) refer to as a rural field. That is one with an extensive range of \nthemes and space for variety and cooperation rather than a highly competitive urban \nspecialism focused on a limited number of central topics. The canon contains distinctive, \nkey inscriptions and includes a collection of concepts and theories that have in the main \nbeen adapted from their origins in contributory disciplines demonstrating the process of \nfinitism. \n Analysis of tourism tribes reveals that the tourism academic community is not a \nconvergent one governed by \u201c \u2018reasonably uniform standards \u2026 \u2018intellectual control\u2019 and \na \u2018stable elite\u2019 \u201d (Becher & Trowler, 2001, p. 185) and points rather to a divergent \ncommunity which allows a broad range of approaches and tolerates individual difference. \nIt is interesting to note here a congruence between tribes (no convergent community) and \nterritories (no paradigm).Within this divergent community there are references to \ndominant clans in terms of gender, age and ethnicity (as well as resistance to this) and \nthere is also evidence of tribal allegiance to, and some rivalry between, those in different \nclans (e.g. business vs. social science). It is also true that universities and \ndepartmentalism sometimes forge convergence and there are other converging influences, \nfor example elders and gatekeepers, a well established invisible college, funding regimes \nand key journals which define and promote significant obligatory passage points. \nIndividual research freedom can also be constrained by performativity yet divergence is \nmaintained through cheap and hobby research. Research freedom also appears easier to \nclaim by older researchers holding senior positions. Other evidence of divergence \nincludes the gradual rise of a new guard with more gender balance and the Academy of \nTourism facing competition for influence from other networks groupings.  \n \nNetwork analysis has shown how two exemplar tourism studies networks have been \ndeveloped and performed, how new networks are coming into being and underlined the \nimportance of material and non-material influences. Tourism Studies could have taken \nmany different forms but after Latour (1987) it developed from \u2018unconnected localities\u2019 \nand worked up \u2018provisionally commensurable connections\u2019. It went from atomised, \ndisparate knowledge through a period of institutionalisation as illustrated by the \nformation of the two deep networks of tourism social science and the business of tourism. \nBut other networks are evident. Some resistance to the business of tourism sparked \nresearch in other \u2018unconnected localities\u2019 in sustainable tourism. More recently critical \ntourism is enrolling, people, ideas and inscriptions. Other networks such as ATLAS, ISA-\nRC50, TTRA, APTA and CAUTHE hold together actors by region or special interest. In \ncontrast whilst the mobilities paradigm has enrolled scholars, journals and books it has \nnot successfully recruited mainstream tourism studies allies and it remains a network \nlargely outside of tourism with only small network overlap.  \n \nThese concluding remarks present a macro picture of the field of tourism driven by \ndynamic networks and exhibiting strengths in its sweep of remit and openness to new \nideas. Paradoxically the data also reveals that at the micro level of the individual some \nfeel marginalised and limited in their freedom to research. It also highlights tensions \nbetween industry vs. blue skies research, individuals vs. institutions, new guard vs. old \nguard, business vs. social science and those who feel outsiders vs. insiders. Further there \nis some frustration at the bottlenecking and standardising caused by the operation of \nobligatory passage points. There is also evidence of omissions in the canon so that \n\u201cother\u201d knowledges, extra-metropolitan research, under-empowered groups and values-\nbased research are overlooked. Additionally there is some shakiness in the foundations of \ntourism studies in terms of lack of own theory which also manifests itself in the uncertain \nskills of generation T. \n But the analysis of this article also suggests ways that issues of research silences, \ntensions, invisibilities, marginalised individuals and inequality of opportunity might be \novercome. This would be by enrolling people and things to create strong networks of \nrelations to unleash effective agency in these areas. This in turn would generate feelings \nof empowerment and solidarity. \n \nReferences \n \nAirey, D. (2005). Growth and development. In D. Airey and J.
