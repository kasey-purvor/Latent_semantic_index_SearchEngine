Box 40, Jarash, Jordan \nE-mail: fothers@ieee.org \n \nABSTRACT \nDielectric spectroscopy measurements below 1 Hz are \noften dominated by \u201cconduction-like\u201d effects.  For this \nreason, they often appear to be dismissed as being of \nlittle interest. In this paper two \u201csub-hertz\u201d responses are \nconsidered that give insights into the insulating systems \nconcerned. The first system is that of cross-linked po-\nlyethylene, taken from a power cable system.  Mea-\nsurements at temperatures between 60\u02da C and close to \nmelting at 100\u02daC show a change in characteristic from a \npercolation process to a \u201ctrue\u201d DC conduction at close \nto the melting point.  Using DC conductivities, it ap-\npears to be possible to show whether the cable has been \nsubjected to thermo-electric ageing. This might give \ninsights into where the conduction and hence the ageing \nin the XLPE is occurring. The second system is an \nepoxy composite.  By considering the sub-hertz re-\nsponse, it is possible to demonstrate the effect of the \ninterface between the filler and the epoxy matrix. In this \nsystem, ageing, resulting in delamination between the \nglass fiber filler and the epoxy, is clearly detected by \nsub-hertz dielectric spectroscopy. This process is likely \nto be facilitated by the presence of water, which is \nknown to lead to mechanical failure in such systems, and \nwhich can also be detected by \"sub-hertz\" dielectric \nspectroscopy. The implications for nano-dielectrics are \nthen briefly considered. \nEXPERIMENTAL \nThe measurements presented here were made using a \nSolatron dielectric spectrometer comprising a 1255 fre-\nquency response analyzer with a 1296A CDI dielectric \ninterface. An excitation voltage of 1 V RMS was used. \nThe measurement cell comprised a guarded electrode \nsystem formed by slightly adapting a Keithley 6165 \u201cre-\nsistivity adapter\u201d cell.  The diameter of the guarded \nelectrode was 50.8 mm (2 in).  Measurements were \nmade by averaging at least four readings at each fre-\nquency. The cell was maintained at the desired temper-\nature to within 0.2\u02daC.  This guard ring cell was used as \nthe specimens were expected to have extremely low \nlosses.  However, considerable noise was observed \nwhen the loss tangent was <10-3. \nMeasurements on XLPE \nMeasurements were made on XLPE (cross-linked po-\nlyethylene) tapes that had been peeled from power cable \ninsulation. The tapes were 150 \u00b5m thick and the surface \nRMS roughness was approximately 1 \u00b5m. Cables from \ndifferent manufacturers were tested both \u201cas made\u201d and \nafter electro-thermal ageing. \nMeasurements on Epoxy Resin \nMeasurements were also made on a commercially pro-\nduced epoxy \u2013 glass composite used for printed circuit \nboards (PCBs); a standard \u201cFR4\u201d printed-circuit board \nmaterial, type N4000-2 made by Park-Nelco.  This was \n400 \u00b5m thick comprising approximately: 50 \u00b5m epoxy, \n100 \u00b5m epoxy impregnated e-glass mat, 100 \u00b5m epoxy, \nanother 100 \u00b5m epoxy impregnated e-glass mat, and \n50 \u00b5m epoxy.  \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nCross-Linked Polyethylene \nLow frequency measurements dielectric relaxation \nmeasurements on XLPE are shown in Figure 1.  \n1E-14\n1E-13\n1E-12\n1E-11\n1E-10\n1E-9\n1E-4 1E-3 1E-2 1E-1\nfrequency\/Hz\nca\npa\nci\nta\nnc\ne\/\nfa\nra\nds\nC' 343\nC' 353\nC' 363\nC' 373\nC\" 343\nC\" 353\nC\" 363\nC\" 373\nC\" limit\n \nFigure 1: Low Frequency Dielectric Spectroscopy on XLPE \ncable samples.  'C\" limit' is the noise floor of the instrument. \nMeasurements were made in 10\u02daC steps from 293  K \n(20\u02daC) to 373 K (100\u02da C). Howeve r, only results from \nthe highest four temperatures are reported here as there \nwas significant noise in the C\" results at lower tempera-\ntures. It can be seen that the C' values are virtually iden-\ntical and independent of frequency.  The C\" values \nform straight lines on this Bode plot indicating  \n( ) nC \u2212\u221d\u2032\u2032 \u03c9\u03c9  (Equation 1) \nThe temperature dependence of n is shown in Figure 2. \n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3\n1000\/Temperature \/(1000\/K)\nn\n =\n s\nlo\npe\n o\nf C\n\" o\nn \nB\nod\ne \npl\not\n \nFigure 2: Slope of C\" vs. frequency Bode plot at different \ntemperatures \u2013 the square symbol indicates a hypothetical \npoint described in the text. \nThe magnitude of the slope increases with temperature. \nA slope of 1=n  would indicate a true DC conductivity \nsince C' is independent of frequency. To see this, con-\nsider the admittance of a complex capacitor to be equiv-\nalent to the simple parallel combination of R (=1\/G) and \nC. Then CjGCj \u03c9\u03c9 +=*  so that \n\u03c9\u03c9\nGjCC\nj\nGC \u2212=+=* .  The complex capacitance is \ndefined as \"'* jCCC \u2212=  so that, in this simple example, \nCC ='  and \u03c9GC =\" .  Note that, if there is a true \nconductivity to be measured, this is seen at low frequen-\ncies as a slope of \u20131 on a plot of ( )\"log C  versus \n( )\u03c9log  and that C' is independent of frequency.  This \nis a very good test to see if a true conductivity is actually \nbeing measured.  The temperature required for DC \nconduction appears to be equal to the melting point of \nXLPE (380 K) shown by the square symbol in Figure 2. \nThe conductivity at 373 K is approximately \n7.7 \u00d7 10-15 \u2126-1m-1. The value of n did not drop below \n0.5 at lower temperatures. \nAt lower temperatures, it is tempting to ascribe the \npower law behavior of C\" ( ( ) nC \u2212\u221d\u2032\u2032 \u03c9\u03c9  (Equation 1) \nto a low-frequency dispersion (LFD), Quasi-DC (QDC) \nprocess [1,2]. However, it is important to note that, in \nsuch a case, the slopes of C' and C\" on the Bode plot \nwould be parallel giving a constant for tan \u03b4.  Clearly, \nthis is not the case.  The behavior seems to be percola-\ntion-like and described by Dissado and Hill [3] using a \ndeterministic-fractal-circuit model.  The behavior that \nthey predict for percolation is shown in Figure 3. \n \nFigure 3: Computed AC response of a determinis-\ntic-fractal-circuit above the percolation threshold.  Adapted \nfrom Fig. 3 of [3]; f=0.55 N=8, h=0.5, n=20 \nIn this model, a fractal circuit of capacitors and resistors \nis constructed from N elements, a fraction, f, of these \nelements being resistors \u2013 i.e. capable of supporting \ncurrent flow, the others being a parallel connection of \ntwo rows of sub-components.  The sub-components are \ndistributed such that there is a fraction h in one row and \n( )h\u22121  in the next. Reducing f towards the fixed value \nof h eventually eliminates the last percolation path when \nhf = . For hf > the transport is percolative.  Further \nevidence of this behavior is found by considering the \nbroader dielectric spectrum. Unfortunately, the noise is \nrather significant in this low-loss material and so an av-\neraging process has been used to give a representative \nspectrum of a slightly different XLPE in Figure 4. \n1E-15\n1E-14\n1E-13\n1E-12\n1E-11\n1E-10\n1E-09\n1E-3 1E-1 1E+1 1E+3 1E+5 1E+7\nfrequency\/Hz\nC\nap\nac\nita\nnc\ne\/\nFa\nra\nd\n0.5\n-0.71\n \nFigure 4: C' (upper) and C\" (averaged results) for another \npower cable XLPE. The encircled points are unreliable. \nThis appears to lend further support to the Hill and Dis-\nsado percolative model being applicable to this situation.  \nComparing Figure 3 and Figure 4, the values of \n71.00 =\u2206  and 5.0=\u2206\u221e  can be established, although \nthese values should not be taken as being very accurate.  \nAn infinite number of solutions can be found for the \nvalues of h, f and N. Selecting { }32,16,8=N  and \n{ }50.0,45.0=h , best fitting values of f can be computed, \nsee Table 1. It can be seen that f is always bigger than h, \nindicating percolative behavior. \nN 8 16 32 8 16 32 \nh 0.45 0.45 0.45 0.5 0.5 0.5 \nf 0.488 0.459 0.452 0.533 0.508 0.502 \nTable 1: Possible fractal circuit parameters \nIt seems therefore that, at least under the conditions stu-\ndied, charge carriers percolate through XLPE.  The \nconditions for percolation change with temperature \u2013 \npossibly through a variation in the fraction of sites that \nare able to support charge transport.  As XLPE is \nheated, much of the crystalline lamella regions start to \nmelt. This would suggest that conduction is primarily \nthrough the amorphous region (although possibly in the \namorphous \u2013 crystalline interface) with true DC conduc-\ntion not occurring until the onset of melting. \nFinally on the subject of power cable XLPE, the \nlow-frequency C\" results can be used to estimate the \nconductivity as a function of temperature.  An Arrhe-\nnius plot is shown in Figure 5. The squares are for two \ndifferent aged cables and the circles for two different \nun-aged cables.  Different manufacturers made the \ncables using similar materials for the XLPE. It is inter-\nesting that the cables can be so well differentiated using \nthis technique. This may indicate permanent changes to \nthe crystalline structure occurring during the ageing. \n-37\n-36\n-35\n-34\n-33\n-32\n2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3 3.1\n1000\/T\nln\n(c\non\ndu\nct\niv\nity\n)\n \nFigure 5: Arrhenius plot for two aged (squares) and two \nun-aged (circles) XLPE power cables. \nEpoxy-Glass PCB Composite \nDielectric relaxation measurements on the \nprinted-circuit board (PCB) epoxy-glass composite are \nshown in Figure 6. Measurements were made in 10\u02daC \nsteps from 293 K (20\u02da C) to 363  K (90\u02da C). The relative \ndisplacement of the curves is shown by the index points \nin the graph \u2013 it can be seen that it was only necessary to \nshift the curves along the frequency axis to cause them \nto come into coincidence.  It can be seen that the C\" \nlow-frequency dispersion has a slope of \u20130.8 and is \ntherefore not that of a true DC conduction.  Indeed, \nneither is C' independent of frequency.  This is a Q-DC \nprocess [1]. The Arrhenius behavior of this Q-DC \nprocess, shown in Figure 7, is found by plotting the log \n{frequency shift} versus 1000\/temperature.  An activa-\ntion energy of 1.1 eV was found.  \n1E-13\n1E-12\n1E-11\n1E-10\n1E-09\n1E-3 1E-1 1E+1 1E+3 1E+5\nFrequency(Hz)\nC\nap\nac\nita\nnc\ne \n(F\n)\n90 C 20 C\n \nFigure 6: A master-curve formed from dielectric spectroscopy \nmeasurements on the epoxy \u2013 glass composite. \n-4\n-3.5\n-3\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n2.7 2.9 3.1 3.3 3.5\n1000\/T( K)\nlo\ng(\n1\/\nsh\nift\n)\n \nFigure 7: Arrhenius plot for low-frequency Q-DC process \nfound in the epoxy-glass PCB composite. \nSimilar measurements were then made on specimens \nthat had been aged to electrical failure under fields of \n25 kV.mm-1 at 363K (90\u00b0C) and also on the glass mat.  \nThese all displayed Q-DC processes, whose temperature \ndependencies are summarized in Figure 8. \n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2.5 2.7 2.9 3.1 3.3 3.5\n1000\/T(K)\nlo\ng(\n1\/\nsh\nift\n)\nun-aged\n5weeks\n87days\nfailed\nmat\n \nFigure 8: Arrhenius plots for un-aged, aged, failed epoxy \nPCB composites and the glass mat. \nThe glass mat had a much lower activation energy of \nonly 0.67 eV since charge carriers can move over the \nglass surface; possibly through a hydration layer.  It is \nclear that the ageing process is causing a displacement \nof the Q-DC process to higher frequencies \u2013 i.e. it is \nmaking the charges less constrained. It can be seen that \nthe specimen that broke down exhibited virtually the \nsame activation energy as the mat. Further microscopic \nexamination has shown that this was probably caused by \ngradual delamination of the epoxy from the glass mat.   \nThis delamination is consistent with water absorption by \nthe epoxy, which is known to occur [4]. This can lead to \na weakening of the bonding between the glass and epoxy \n[5].  Electrolytes can form on the surface that may \nsupport charge movement and may contribute to break-\ndown (e.g. Janssen et al [6\n1E-13\n1E-12\n1E-11\n1E-10\n1E-09\n1E-03 1E-02 1E-01 1E+00 1E+01 1E+02\nFrequency\/Hz\nC\nap\nac\nita\nnc\ne\/\nfa\nra\nd\ndry\nroom\n12 h\n24 h\n48 h\n]). Certainly, the effect of \nhumidity on epoxy-glass resins is very significant. Fig-\nure 9 shows some preliminary results for various hydra-\ntions: dry = 72 h in a vacuum oven at 50\u02daC, room = \nstandard laboratory conditions, x h = specimen was left \nin water for x hours. Although the actual hydration le-\nvels were not measured, this shows a clear trend of in-\ncreasing low-frequency loss with humidity.  In these \nexperiments, the real capacitance does not increase \nmuch at low frequencies except for the highest humidi-\nties, suggesting charge percolation along a hydrated \ninterface between the glass mat and the epoxy. \n \nFigure 9: Effect of hydration on epoxy-glass PCB composite.  \nComrie et al [7\nNano-Filled Epoxy Resin \n] have reported on the effects of expo-\nsure of thick film adhesive-bonded structures to mois-\nture using broadband dielectric spectroscopy (10-2 Hz to \n3 GHz). They note that changes in the low frequency \ndielectric response can be attributed, inter alia, to inter-\nfacial effects. Their data are complemented by mechan-\nical failure analysis of the bond structure. The dielectric \ndata parallels the changes in the mechanical data for \nthese systems. Indeed, they state that their study, \"de-\nmonstrates the usefulness of the dielectric approach for \nthe assessment of ageing in adhesive-bonded structures \nand emphasized the importance of extending the dielec-\ntric measurements to lower frequencies.\"  \nIt is also interesting to note that the sub-hertz dielectric \nspectroscopy of nano-filled epoxy resin exhibits a per-\ncolation (Q-DC) response evidenced by a constant tan \u03b4, \nwhereas that of the equivalent micro-filled material \nshows a classical Maxwell-Wagner behavior where \ncharge transport is capacitively blocked [8\n1E-2\n1E-1\n1E+0\n1E+1\n1E+2\n1E-3 1E-2 1E-1 1E+0 1E+1 1E+2 1E+3 1E+4 1E+5 1E+6\nFrequency \/Hz\nLo\nss\n ta\nng\nen\nt (\nta\nn \n\u03b4)\nbase resin\nmicro 10% TiO2\nnano 10% TiO2\nmicro 10% Al2O3\nnano 10% ZnO\n \n], Figure 10. \nIt may be speculated that this difference in charge \ntransport is responsible for the lower charge densities \nobserved in the nano-filled material \nFigure 10: Loss tangent of unfilled and 10% micro- and na-\nno- filled materials at 393 K \nCONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper, we have attempted to emphasize the im-\nportance of low-frequency (\"Sub-Hertz\") dielectric \nspectroscopy. We note that such data can give insights \ninto the way charge carriers move through such mate-\nrials and how this might change with temperature.  This \nhas lead to new insights into such mechanisms in XLPE.  \nWe have also shown how such measurements may give \ninsights into ageing, and electrical and mechanical fail-\nure mechanisms by using the example of an \nepoxy-composite and the effect on this of the variation \nof humidity. It is clear that this will also be important in \nconsidering the effects of water on the nano-composites \nbeing proposed for dielectrics. \nREFERENCES \n \n1  L.A. Dissado and R.M.
