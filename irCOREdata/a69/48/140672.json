This showed that the optimum aw and temperature conditions for T-2 + HT-2 23 \nproduction was between 0.98-0.995, and 20-30\u00baC respectively. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of ranks 24 \nshowed a statistically significant differences between the different aw levels examined 25 \n(P<0.001) but no significant effect of the temperatures examined. The ratio of HT-2\/T-2 was 26 \ninvestigated and non-uniform distribution of HT-2 toxin was found under different ecological 27 \nconditions. No statistically significant differences were found for the mean toxin production 28 \nbetween strains from the different countries. Intra-strain differences in toxin production was 29 \nonly found for those from Finland (P-value=0.0247). The growth\/no growth and toxin\/no toxin 30 \nconditions in relation to aw x temperature have been constructed for the first time. This 31 \nknowledge will be useful in developing prevention strategies to minimise T-2 and HT-2 toxin 32 \ncontamination by strains of F. langsethiae on important small grain cereals.  33 \n 34 \nKey words: Type A trichothecenes, Fusarium, mycotoxins, ecological conditions 35 \n 3 \n \n1. Introduction 36 \nFusarium langsethiae has been isolated from infected oats, wheat and barley in central and 37 \nnorthern Europe (Torp & Adler, 2004; Torp & Niremberg; 2004). This species has been 38 \nimplicated in the production of high levels of T-2 and HT-2 mycotoxins in cereals in Norway 39 \n(Langseth & Rundberget, 1999; Torp and Langseth, 1999) and in oats in the UK (Edwards, 40 \n2007). F. langsethiae has been isolated from infected symptomless oat and wheat grains which 41 \nmakes detection of contamination often very difficult. Its pathogenicity on these cereals has 42 \nbeen recently demonstrated (Imathiu et al., 2009). 43 \nT-2 and HT-2 toxins are type-A trichothecenes produced by different Fusarium species 44 \nsuch as F. acuminatum, F. sporotrichioides, F. poae, and the recently described species F. 45 \nlangsethiae (Bottalico, 1998; Torp & Adler, 2004; Torp & Niremberg; 2004). T-2 toxin is 46 \nproduced by Fusarium species and is rapidly metabolized to HT-2 toxin which is also the main 47 \nmetabolite in vivo (Eriksen & Alexander, 1998; Visconti, 2001). Studies on the metabolism of T-48 \n2 (Matsumoto et al., 1978) suggested that the liver is the major organ for its metabolism, 49 \nalthough other tissues are capable of metabolic modification of this toxin. Hepatic 50 \ncarboxylesterases have been shown to be responsible for the specific deacetylation of T-2, 51 \nresulting in HT-2 as the major metabolite (Matsumoto et al., 1978; Johnsen et al., 1988). T-2 52 \ntoxin, the most toxic Type A trichothecene, is a potent inhibitor of DNA, RNA, protein synthesis 53 \nand mitochondrial function, and shows immunosuppressive and cytotoxic effects both in vivo 54 \nand in vitro (Visconti et al., 1991; Canady et al., 2001; Visconti, 2001). A recent survey 55 \nconducted in order to evaluate the risk of dietary exposure to Fusarium toxins by the 56 \npopulation of EU member states, showed that T-2 and HT-2 toxins are quite common 57 \ncontaminants in cereals in the EU (Schothorst & van Egmond, 2004).  58 \nThis resulted in special attention being paid to the toxic effects of T-2 in the Joint 59 \nFAO\/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) where the safety of certain 60 \nmycotoxins in food was evaluated (WHO\/FAO, 2001). JECFA concluded that the toxic effects of 61 \n 4 \n \nT-2 and its metabolite HT-2 could not be differentiated, and that the in vivo toxicity of T-2 62 \nmight be due partly to toxic effects of HT-2. Therefore, the provisional maximum tolerable 63 \ndaily intake (PMTDI) for these toxins was fixed at 60 ng\/kg body weight per day, including 64 \nintake of T-2 and HT-2, alone or in combination (WHO\/FAO, 2001). Recently, the European 65 \nFood Safety Authority (EFSA) published a report on the toxicity of these trichothecenes and 66 \nthey concluded that the toxicity of T-2 toxin in vivo is considered to include that of HT-2 toxin 67 \nand the results of studies with T-2 toxin are used to approximate the effects of HT-2 toxin 68 \n(Schuhmacher-Wolz et al., 2010). The European Commission (EC) has established, with 69 \nRegulations No. 856\/2005 and No. 1881\/2006, admissible levels of several Fusarium toxins in 70 \ncereals and cereal-based products which became effective from 1 July, 2006. Maximum 71 \nadmissible levels for T-2 and HT-2 toxins in unprocessed cereals and cereal products are 72 \ncurrently under discussion (Commission Regulation (EC) No 856\/2005; Commission Regulation 73 \n(EC) No 1881\/2006). 74 \nIt is now accepted that mycotoxin production is predominantly dependent on 75 \nnutritional and ecological factors. Of the abiotic ecological factors, the water availability (water 76 \nactivity; aw) and temperature are important factors which impact on both growth and 77 \nmycotoxin production (Magan & Lacey, 1984; Sanchis & Magan, 2004; Magan & Aldred, 2007; 78 \nMagan et al., 2010). While information is available on the relationship between these factors 79 \nand profiles for growth and deoxynivalenol production by F. culmorum and F. graminearum, 80 \nthere is practically no information for F. langsethiae (Hope et al., 2005). As this species has 81 \nbecome very important in northern Europe in a range of small grains it is important to 82 \nunderstand the ecology of this species and whether any intra- or inter-strain differences may 83 \nexist. Recently, we reported on the effect of aw x temperature on growth of 8 strains, two each 84 \nfrom the U.K., Norway, Sweden and Finland on an oat-based medium (Medina & Magan, 85 \n2010). This showed that there were no statistical differences in terms of aw and temperature 86 \ntolerances of the strains in terms of growth. The aw and temperature optima were 0.98-0.995 87 \n 5 \n \nand 25\u00baC and growth limits were established at 0.92-0.93 aw and 37\u00baC and 5\u00baC, respectively. 88 \nThere is no comparable information on how these interacting factors may affect T-2 and HT-2 89 \nproduction and whether intra- or inter-strain differences exist. This is critical in developing 90 \nmodels to predict environmental conditions which represent a high risk and those that 91 \nrepresent a low risk for contamination with these two mycotoxins.   92 \nThe objectives of this study were thus to (a) determine the effect of aw x temperature 93 \ninteractions on T-2, HT-2 and totals for two strains from four different northern European 94 \ncountries (U.K., Norway, Sweden, Finland) on an oat-based medium, (b) to evaluate any intra-95 \nor inter-strain differences and (c) develop contour maps of the optimum and marginal 96 \nconditions for the production of these two mycotoxins and compare these with limits for 97 \ngrowth reported recently (Medina & Magan, 2010).   98 \n 99 \n2. Materials and methods 100 \n2.1. Strains.  101 \nEight F. langsethiae strains from different northern European countries were examined. The 102 \nisolates were from the UK (2004\/57, 2004\/59); Norway (44P, 88E); Sweden (560, 562) and 103 \nFinland (05010, 05014). 104 \n 105 \n2.2. Medium preparation and fungal culture.  106 \nMilled oats were prepared by homogenisation for 5 mins in a Waring laboratory science 107 \nhomogeniser model 7009G (Waring Laboratory Science, CT, USA). Mixtures of 2% (w\/v) oat 108 \nflour in water were prepared and 2% (w\/v) agar added. Water used to prepare the medium 109 \nwas modified with glycerol to the required water activity levels (aw; 0.995, 0.98, 0.95, 0.93, 110 \n0.90 and 0.88). The culture media were prepared by autoclaving for 20 minutes at 121\u00baC. The 111 \nmedium was vigorously shaken and poured into 9 cm diameter Petri dishes.  112 \n 6 \n \nThe eight strains of F. langsethiae were inoculated using 7 day old cultures by taking 113 \nagar discs (4 mm diameter) with a cork borer from the growing margin of the colonies and 114 \ninoculating the treatment plates centrally. The aw treatments were incubated at different 115 \ntemperatures (35, 30, 25, 20, 15 and 10 \u00baC) for 10 days. All experiences were carried out with 116 \nthree replicates per treatments, and in some cases repeated twice.  117 \n 118 \n2.3. Reagents and standards.  119 \nTrichothecene standards, including T-2 and HT-2 were supplied by Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). 120 \nT-2 standard was dissolved in acetonitrile at a concentration of 2.0 mg mL-1 and stored at -26 121 \n\u00baC in a sealed vial until use. HT-2 standard solution in acetonitrile was purchased at a 122 \nconcentration of 100.2 \u00b5g mL-1. Working standards (50, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1, 0.5 and 0.2 \u00b5g mL-1) 123 \nwere prepared by appropriate dilution of known volumes of the stock solutions with 124 \nacetonitrile and used to obtain calibration curves for LC-DAD analysis. Acetonitrile and 125 \nmethanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fisher Scientific UK Ltd., UK). All solvents 126 \nwere HPLC grade. Pure water was obtained from a Milli-R\/Q water system (Millipore, Billerica, 127 \nMA, USA) and used when water was required. 128 \n 129 \n2.4. Sample preparation.  130 \nUsing a cork borer, six-seven discs of agar weighing approx.  0.75 grams were removed from 131 \nthe fungal cultures and placed in previously weighed 2 mL volume safe-lock Eppendorf tubes. 132 \nA total of 3 replicates per treatment were collected, weighed, and immediately frozen at -20\u00baC 133 \nand stored.    134 \n 135 \n2.5. Extraction procedure.  136 \nExtraction was made using the methodology described by Medina et al. (2010). Briefly, 137 \nsamples were thawed and extracted by mixing the agar plugs with a one ml mixture of 138 \n 7 \n \nmethanol:water (80:20 v\/v). The tubes were shaken at 150 rev min-1 at 25\u00baC in the dark in an 139 \norbital shaker for 90 min. They were then centrifuged at 1150 g for 15 min and 750 \u00b5L of 140 \nsupernatant  transferred to a 2 mL chromatography silanized amber vial. Extracts were 141 \ncompletely dried in a stream of nitrogen. Dry extracts were redissolved in 300 \u00b5l of 142 \nacetonitrile:water (50:50 v\/v).   143 \n 144 \n2.6. HPLC-DAD analysis.  145 \nThe HPLC equipment consisted of an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system equipped with a UV 146 \ndiode-array detector set at 200 nm (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The column was 147 \na Phenomenex\u00ae Gemini C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 3 \u03bcm (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) 148 \npreceded by a Phenomenex\u00ae Gemini C18 3 mm, 3 \u03bcm guard cartridge. Signals were processed 149 \nby Agilent ChemStation software Ver. B Rev: 03.01 [317] (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, 150 \nUSA). 151 \nAnalyses were performed in the gradient mode. Solvent A was water and solvent B 152 \nacetonitrile. Gradient conditions were initiated by holding for the first 3 minutes with 30% B, 153 \nafter this the conditions were changed linearly to 55% B for 18 min. The composition was then 154 \nchanged to 99% B in one minute and maintained for 5 min as a cleaning step in order to 155 \nimprove the results. After cleaning, conditions were returned to the initial 30% B. The flow rate 156 \nof the mobile phase was 1 mL min\u22121 and injection volume was 50 \u00b5L. 157 \n 158 \n2.7. Statistical analysis and profiling.  159 \nStatistical analysis was performed using the package JMP\u00ae 8 (SAS Institute Inc., 2008. Cary, NC, 160 \nUSA) and package STATISTICA 8 (StatSoft\u00ae Inc., 2007. Tulsa, OK, USA).  161 \nData on toxin production were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test.  Due to 162 \nnon-normality of the toxin concentration data, analysis was performed using non-parametric 163 \ntests for testing whether distributions across factor levels were centered at the same location. 164 \n 8 \n \nDifferences between independent groups, using temperature and water activity as factors, 165 \nwere examined by the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of ranks. Analysis was performed for all data 166 \nsets, including the 8 strains, and also for each strain individually. In order to compare strains 167 \nfrom the same origin, t-tests were used. 168 \nProfiling graphs were performed using Sigma Plot v.10.0 (Systat Software Inc. 169 \nHounslow, London, UK). 170 \n 171 \n3. Results 172 \n3.1. Effects of temperature and water activity on T-2 and HT-2 production.  173 \nEffect of aw in the production of both mycotoxins individually is shown in Figure 1. This shows 174 \nthat reducing aw from 0.995 to 0.95 produced a decrease in the mean production of both T-2 175 \nand HT-2 by a factor of approx. 17 and 20 respectively. No toxin production was found when 176 \nthe aw treatment was <0.93. The effect of the aw was studied for the whole data set by Kruskal-177 \nWallis analysis of ranks and this showed a statistically significant differences between the 178 \ndifferent aw levels examined (p<0.001). Statistical analysis of each strain gave the same results, 179 \nshowing the influence of water activity on all strains examined. In this case the p-values ranged 180 \nfrom 0.0014 to 0.0078. 181 \n An example of the effect of temperature on T-2 and HT-2 production is shown in Figure 182 \n2. There was an up to 50% reduction in production of both the toxins at 10oC when compared 183 \nwith that at 20oC and 0.995 aw. The Swedish strains appeared to be somewhat different as HT-184 \n2 production was higher at 10 than 20oC. The effect of the temperature was studied for the 185 \nwhole data set, including the 8 strains, by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of ranks and no significant 186 \ndifferences were found. Strain by strain analysis did not show any significance of temperature 187 \nas a factor with all the p-values >0.6078. Despite this lack of statistical differences, there was a 188 \ngeneral trend in the behavior of F. langesthiae strains. Thus beyond the maximum production 189 \npoint a decrease of temperature resulted in a decrease in toxin production. 190 \n 9 \n \nResponse surfaces representing mean total mycotoxin (T-2 + HT-2) production for two 191 \nstrains in relation to aw (from 0.93 to 0.995) x temperature (10-30\u00baC) are shown for each 192 \ncountry in Figure 3. Generally, the means of the two English and Finnish strains showed very 193 \nsimilar contour maps for production which represent conditions of similar production levels. 194 \nMaximum production were reached when the temperature was 25\u00baC and the aw was 0.98, and 195 \nwhen the temperature was 20\u00baC and the aw 0.995 respectively. Also, in both cases, high 196 \nmycotoxin levels were observed at 30\u00baC at a slightly reduced aw of 0.98.  197 \nSwedish strains appeared to produce higher concentrations of both T-2 and HT-2. In 198 \nthis case maximum production occurred when aw and temperatures were 0.995 and 25\u00baC 199 \nrespectively. Furthermore an increase was observed at 30\u00baC at 0.98 aw. The Norwegian strains 200 \nproduced the lowest concentrations of both mycotoxins with maximum production at 20\u00baC 201 \nand 0.98 aw. 202 \nThe representation of growth\/no growth and toxin\/no toxin (T-2 + HT-2) boundaries of 203 \nF. langsethiae for different water availabilities and temperatures are shown in Figure 4.  This 204 \ndemonstrates that toxin production by strains of F. langsethiae occurred over a narrower 205 \nrange of environmental conditions. While growth occurred at 0.90 aw under the best 206 \ntemperature conditions, toxin production was only possible at 0.93 aw. At marginal 207 \ntemperatures the difference between growth and toxin production was reduced. 208 \n 209 \n3.2. Examination of HT-2\/T-2 ratios.  210 \nThe ratio of HT-2 against T-2 toxin in each treatment condition was calculated using the 211 \nformula:  212 \nR= HT-2\/ T-2 213 \nResults obtained showed a non-uniform distribution of HT-2 toxin at all the ecological 214 \nconditions. Overall, a substantial increase in R was observed in all strains studied under 215 \ndifferent ecological conditions. 216 \n 10 \n \nIn experiments where the temperatures where higher (20, 25 and 30\u00baC) the R 217 \nincreased when aw was decreased to 0.95 or 0.93. When temperatures where lower (10 and 218 \n15\u00baC) the R was higher when aw levels were 0.98 and 0.995. An example of this behaviour is 219 \nshown in Figure 5. Thus, under marginal conditions HT-2 toxin increased in F. langsethiae 220 \nstrains although growth rates were reduced by between 0.5 and 2.5 mm\/day. 221 \n 222 \n3.3. Intra-strain differences based on source of strains.  223 \nHomoscedasticity was checked using the Levene\u2019s and Brown-Forsythe\u2019s tests. Since variances 224 \nwere not equal in some pairs, two different t-tests, one assuming equal and the other unequal 225 \nvariances, were applied where appropriate to find possible differences in T-2 and HT-2 226 \nproduction in strains from the same country of origin.  227 \nSignificant differences regarding toxin production were found between strains from 228 \nFinland (P-value=0.0247). No differences were observed between the strains from the other 229 \nthree countries. 230 \n 231 \n3.4. Inter-strain differences between countries of origin.  232 \nKruskal-Wallis analysis of ranks using the country of origin as a factor was applied to the 233 \ndata in order to find possible differences among countries. Since the p-value was 0.3487, no 234 \nsignificant differences were found regarding the mean toxin production between strains from 235 \ndifferent countries of origin.  236 \n 237 \n4. Discussion 238 \nThis is the first study to examine the effect of ecological factors on the production of T-2 and 239 \nHT-2 and the T-2\/HT-2 ratio by F. langsethiae strains from a range of countries. This has 240 \nprovided new data which suggests that the variation between strains may be quite small, 241 \nalthough there are some exceptions.   242 \n 11 \n \nChanges in water availability appear to be a major controlling factor in affecting T-2 243 \nand HT-2 production. Generally maximum toxin production occurred where mycelia growth 244 \nwas under either a slight aw or temperature stress. These results agree with data from other 245 \nstudies which have compared growth and toxin production by Fusarium species (Magan & 246 \nLacey, 1984; Magan et al., 2002; Sanchis & Magan, 2004). 247 \nOverall strains from England, Finland and Norway exhibited similar tolerances over aw 248 \nconditions of 0.995-0.93 for toxin production. Swedish strains showed a narrower toxin 249 \nproduction window with less produced at 0.98 aw, and practically almost none produced at 250 \n0.95 aw. Evidences of genetic variability has been reported in this species (Yli-Mattila et al., 251 \n2004), supporting the possible existence of variability in ecophysiological performance at an 252 \nintraspecific level. 253 \nInterestingly, for changes in temperature, no statistically significant differences were 254 \nfound. These results showed that F. langsethiae strains can produce T-2 and HT-2 toxins over a 255 \nwide temperature range of 10 to 30\u00baC, which were tested in this study. Some production may 256 \noccur at 5\u00baC with much longer incubation times but this was not tested.   257 \nOur results show that the optimum aw and temperature conditions for T-2 + HT-2 258 \nproduction was between 0.98-0.995, and 20-30\u00baC respectively. The optimum conditions for 259 \nType A trichothecenes have been previously described in different substrates for related 260 \nspecies such as F. sporotrichioides and F. poae. Other authors have studied the production of 261 \ntype A trichothecenes by these species and concluded that moderate rather than warm 262 \ntemperatures were optima for these toxins. Also the optimum production conditions varied 263 \ndepending on the substrate and toxic metabolite. As an example, F. sporotrichioides-infected 264 \nmaize, wheat and rice grains contained more type A trichothecenes when aw was 0.99 and 265 \nwere incubated at 20\u00baC (Miller, 1994; Mateo et al., 2002). Recently Kokkonen et al. (2010) 266 \nhave studied toxin production of F. langsethiae on a mixed cereal medium under 3 267 \nenvironmental regimes (0.996, 0.96 aw) and described maximum production of T-2 and HT-2 268 \n 12 \n \nat aw 0.996 and 15\noC. However, they did not include 0.98 aw which we found to be optimum 269 \nfor production.   270 \nIn their reports, JECFA and EFSA concluded that the toxicity of T-2 toxin in vivo is 271 \nconsidered to include that of HT-2 toxin and the results of studies with T-2 toxin are used to 272 \napproximate the effects of HT-2 toxin (WHO\/FAO, 2001; Schuhmacher-Wolz et al., 2010). 273 \nBecause of this, there has been interest in the total sum of both toxins. However, we have also 274 \nexamined the ratio of these two toxins. This suggested that this ratio may change as water 275 \nstress conditions are imposed.  Thus, we observed that more HT-2 toxin was produced when F. 276 \nlangsethiae was under intermediate stress conditions, where some reduction in growth occurs, 277 \nbut represent conditions which still allow toxin production. More investigation is needed to 278 \nevaluate whether HT-2 toxin is directly produced by the strains, or, whether under ecological 279 \nstress the fungus itself may degrade T-2, the main toxin produced, to HT-2. There are no 280 \nstudies of the metabolic pathways of HT-2 in F. langsethiae but for F. sporotrichioides, a close 281 \nrelated species, a clear pathway has been proposed for the production of T-2 and also HT-2 282 \n(Meek et al., 2003).  On the other hand, degradation of T-2 to HT-2 has been described in F. 283 \ngraminearum, F. nivale, F. solani, F. sporotrichioides and Calonectria nivalis (Vlastimil et al., 284 \n2008) suggesting the possibility of similar metabolic pathways in F. langsethiae. 285 \nThe data obtained in this study on an oat-based nutritional matrix show that F. 286 \nlangsethiae produces mainly T-2 toxin. This finding is in contrast to other studies that describe 287 \na higher amount of natural samples contaminated with HT-2 and also higher concentrations 288 \n(Langseth & Runberget, 1999; Edwards, 2009). However, these studies never examined the 289 \neffect of water or temperature stress. 290 \nIn oat-based culture medium HT-2 was observed in small quantities. Our findings 291 \nsuggest that the predominant toxin produced may be T-2 under most environmental 292 \nconditions. The amount of HT-2 could increase because of the imposed ecological stress 293 \nincreasing the HT-2\/T-2 ratio. Recent data supports our findings describing a switch from T-2 to 294 \n 13 \n \nHT-2 as the major toxin produced depending on the environmental conditions (Kokkonen et 295 \nal., 2010).  Partially, this may be due to T-2 being rapidly transformed to HT-2 by other 296 \nmicroorganisms, by the fungus itself or by the cereal. This possibility has been suggested by 297 \nLattanzio et al. (2009). These authors studied the natural bio-transformation of T-2 into HT-2. 298 \nForty two per cent of the initial T-2 level was transformed naturally by the effect of 299 \ncarboxilesterase (CXE) enzymatic activity after 120 minutes. Different transformation speeds 300 \nhave been observed in different cereals; pointing out that the difference between them could 301 \nbe the amount of CXE or the expression of isoenzymes having different affinities for T-2. This 302 \nenzymatic activity is also present in animal liver and is responsible for degradation in vivo 303 \n(Matsumoto et al., 1978). This enzymatic effect could explain why in natural cereal samples 304 \nthe toxin that is generally found is HT-2 instead of T-2. These differences regarding enzymatic 305 \nactivities could be on the basis of differences that have been suggested in some studies 306 \npointing out higher contamination with F. langsethiae and T-2\/HT-2 toxin in conventional than 307 \norganically produced oats (Edwards, 2009). 308 \nDifferences in toxin contamination of cereals depending on the country of origin have 309 \nalso been found. Scudamore et al. (2009) in a recent four year study of contamination of oats 310 \nwith T-2\/HT-2 found highest contamination in samples from the UK and Ireland while levels 311 \nfrom Scandinavia were usually lower. No differences were found regarding the toxin 312 \nproduction ability of strains of different origin. This supports the findings in the present study 313 \nthat there is very little difference in ecology and toxin production by F. langsethiae strains 314 \nregardless of country of origin. This needs to be further tested by examining strains which have 315 \nalso been found in Germany and France.   316 \nRecently Parikka et al. (2007) found differences on the percentage of infected kernels 317 \ndepending on the cultivation practices. In this case Finnish cereals cultivated using direct 318 \ndrilling had higher F. langsethiae contamination while tilled plots were less contaminated. 319 \n 14 \n \nCombining all this it is clear that different mycotoxin levels in grains would depend on different 320 \ninfection rates by F. langsethiae in the plots and prevailing weather conditions.   321 \nIn summary, the present study has detailed, for the first time, information on the 322 \ninfluence of interacting ecophysiological factors on T-2 and HT-2 toxin by strains of F. 323 \nlangsethiae. Water availability appears to be very important in determining contamination 324 \nlevels with these toxins. In contrast, they are produced over a wide temperature range. Often 325 \noats are harvested late in the season when conditions are wet. Thus inefficient drying may 326 \nallow F. langsethiae to continue to colonise and increase contamination post-harvest.  The 327 \ncontour maps of the growth\/no growth and toxin\/no toxin boundaries are useful for 328 \ndetermining whether a high risk of contamination might occur post-harvest, and perhaps also 329 \nin the field during ripening, in small grain cereals generally, especially oats. Thus, this study 330 \nprovides useful base line data on the conditions which represent a high and low risk for 331 \ncontamination by these mycotoxins which are becoming of growing importance in Europe.  332 \n 333 \n5.

No.:  FM-D-10-00483 \nTitle: Water availability and temperature affects production of T-2 and HT-2 by Fusarium langsethiae \nstrains from north European countries. \nFusarium langsethiae is an important mycotoxigenic species and has become very important in \nnorthern Europe in a range of small grains that appeared to be contaminated with high amounts of \nthese toxins. Thus it was very important to understand the ecology and how control of these toxins \ncan be achieved. \n\u2022 In the present study we have detailed, for the first time, information on the influence of \ninteracting ecophysiological factors on T-2 and HT-2 toxin by strains of F. langsethiae.  \n-Water availability appears to be very important in determining contamination levels \nwith these toxins. In contrast, they are produced over a wide temperature range.  \n\u2022 Two dimensional profiles for optimum and marginal toxin production conditions have been \nbuilt for two strains from each of four northern European countries (UK, Norway, Sweden \nand Finland) on an oat-based medium. \n\u2022 It is the first time that, for this new species, contour map of the growth\/no growth and \ntoxin\/no toxin boundaries have been built and will be published.  \n-These maps will be useful for determining whether a high risk of contamination \nmight occur post-harvest, and perhaps also in the field during ripening, in small grain \ncereals generally, especially oats. \n \n\u2022 For the first time the ratio T-2\/HT-2 ratio has been studied for F. langsethiae. We have \ndescribed the effect that environmental conditions have on this ratio increasing the \nproduction of HT-2 under stress regimes.  \n- This is the first time that the production of T-2 toxin as main toxins and the \ndifferent possibilities for its transformation to HT-2 have been discussed. \nThus this study provides useful base line data on the conditions which represent a high and low risk \nfor contamination by these mycotoxins which are becoming of growing importance in Europe. Also \nwe provide interesting information that will enable further research to be carried out on this species. \n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n0.95 0.99\n\u00b5\ng\n\u00a0\no\nf\n\u00a0\nt\no\nx\ni\nn\n\/\ng\n\u00a0\no\nf\n\u00a0\na\ng\na\nr\n \n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n0.95 0.99\n\u00b5\ng\n\u00a0\no\nf\n\u00a0\nt\no\nx\ni\nn\n\/\ng\n\u00a0\no\nf\n\u00a0\na\ng\na\nr\nEngland Finland Norway Sweden\n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n10\u00baC 20\u00baC\n\u00b5\ng\n\u00a0\no\nf\n\u00a0\nt\no\nx\ni\nn\n\/\ng\n\u00a0\no\nf\n\u00a0\na\ng\na\nr\n \n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n10\u00baC 20\u00baC\n\u00b5\ng\n\u00a0\no\nf\n\u00a0\nt\no\nx\ni\nn\n\/\ng\n\u00a0\no\nf\n\u00a0\na\ng\na\nr\nEngland Finland Norway Sweden\n 10.5\n8.5\n6.5\n4.5\n2.5\n16.5\n14.5\n14.5\n12.5\n12.5\n14.5\n14.5\n14.5\n12.5\n12.5\n12.5\n12.5\n10.5\n10.5\n10.5\n10.5\n16.516.5\n8.5\n8.5\n8.5\n8.5\n6.5\n6.5\n6.5\n6.5\n4.5\n4.5\n4.5\n4.52.5\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\nWater activity\n0.93 0.94 0.95 0.96 0.97 0.98 0.99\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n 8.5\n6.5\n4.5\n2.5\n14.5\n12.5\n10.5\n10.5\n10.5\n10.5\n8.5\n8.5\n8.5\n8.5\n6.5\n6.5\n6.5\n6.5\n4.5\n4.5\n4.5\n4.5\n4.5\n12.5\n12.5\n12.5\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\nWater activity\n0.93 0.94 0.95 0.96 0.97 0.98 0.99\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n 2.5\n4.5\n8.5\n6.5\n6.5\n6.5\n6.5\n6.5\n6.5\n6.5\n6.5\n10.510.5\n8.5\n8.5\n8.5\n8.5\n8.5\n4.5\n4.5\n4.5\n4.5\n4.5\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\nWater activity\n0.93 0.94 0.95 0.96 0.97 0.98 0.99\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n 25.5\n20.5\n20.5\n15.5\n15.5\n15.5\n10.5\n5.5\n10.5\n10.5\n10.5\n10.5\n10.5 15.5\n5.5\n5.5\n5.5\n5.5\n5.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\nWater activity\n0.93 0.94 0.95 0.96 0.97 0.98 0.99\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n \nMarginal\u00a0growth Marginal\u00a0toxin\u00a0production\n \nEngland\nFinland\nNorway\nSweden\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\n20\u00baC\n20\u00baC\n15\u00baC\n15\u00baC0.98 0.99\n0.98\n0.99\nR\nTemperature\/\nWater\u00a0availability\nEngland\nFinland\nNorway\nSweden\n"}
