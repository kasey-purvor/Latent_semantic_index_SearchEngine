In eukaryotes, both\npolarization and cell cycle progression rely on evolutionarily\nconserved mechanisms that include, respectively, the cytoskeletal\nactin nucleation machinery and cyclins\/cyclin-dependent kinase\n(CDK) activity. These mechanisms are, in turn, coordinated by\ncheckpoints that ensure asymmetric cell division events occur in\ntheir correct order (Hartwell and Weinert, 1989).\nIt follows that distinctive patterns of asymmetric division in\ndifferent eukaryotic cell types may be explained largely by\ndifferences between the identity and order of checkpoints, rather\nthan by differences between the basic mechanisms of polarization\nor cell cycle progression (Jensen et al., 2006; King et al., 1994).\nFor example, in early Drosophila embryos, actin nucleation and\nDNA replication (Callaini et al., 1992; Raff and Glover, 1988) are\nnot interdependent and this checkpoint absence promotes\nsynchronous nuclear division (Hartwell and Weinert, 1989;\nSullivan et al., 1993). Other organisms, such as Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae, show more stringent coordination of polarization and\ncell cycle progression, with cytoskeletal actin nucleation only\nbeginning once cells have passed through the \u2018start\u2019 checkpoint of\nlate G1\/S phase (Moffat and Andrews, 2004; Singer et al., 1984).\nThis actin nucleation is itself then monitored by a second,\n\u2018morphogenesis\u2019, checkpoint (Lew and Reed, 1995), which\ndelays G2-to-M progression until cytoskeletal rearrangements\nhave turned the parent cell into a characteristic \u2018shmoo\u2019 shape\n(Keaton and Lew, 2006; McMillan et al., 1998).\nIt is particularly important to understand such checkpoint control\nduring eukaryotic embryogenesis, because the first asymmetric cell\ndivision defines the embryonic axes that ensure correct multicellular\npatterning in the adult organism (Huynh and St Johnston, 2004;\nJenik and Barton, 2005). To this end, the externally fertilized\ngametes of brown algae provide an excellent model for\ndevelopmental studies of environmentally polarized embryos\n(Brownlee and Bouget, 1998; Peters et al., 2008). In Fucus serratus\nzygotes, as in S. cerevisiae, polarization and DNA replication are\nboth reliant on late G1\/S phase CDK activity (Corellou et al.,\n2001b). However, the potential importance of actin and cytosolic\nCa2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) signals \u2013 which are known to regulate CDKs in\nmany systems (Lew and Reed, 1995; Philipova and Whitaker, 1998)\n\u2013 has not been addressed in this, or in any other, multicellular plant\nor algal zygotic model.\nSpecifically, although it is well established that [Ca2+]cyt\nelevations follow sperm-egg fusion in a number of algal (Roberts et\nal., 1994), animal (Gilkey et al., 1978) and flowering plant eggs\n(Digonnet et al., 1997), in many of these organisms continued\n[Ca2+]cyt elevations are also known to integrate subsequent\ndevelopmental events (Whitaker, 2006a). In Fucus zygotes,\nlocalized [Ca2+]cyt elevations are known to be essential for\nfertilization (Roberts et al., 1994) and polarization (Pu and\nRobinson, 1998; Speksnijder et al., 1989), but a potential role for\npost-fertilization [Ca2+]cyt increases in initiating and co-ordinating\ncell cycle progression has not been explored.\nIn the present study, we test the hypothesis that [Ca2+]cyt\nelevations coordinate actin nucleation, polarization and cell cycle\nprogression during the first Fucus zygotic cell cycle. Previous\nattempts to study developmental [Ca2+]cyt elevations in algal zygotes\nCa2+ signals coordinate zygotic polarization and cell cycle\nprogression in the brown alga Fucus serratus\nJohn H. F. Bothwell1, Jolanta Kisielewska2, Martin J. Genner1, Martin R. McAinsh3 and Colin Brownlee1,*\nZygotes of the fucoid brown algae provide excellent models for addressing fundamental questions about zygotic symmetry\nbreaking. Although the acquisition of polarity is tightly coordinated with the timing and orientation of the first asymmetric division\n\u2013 with zygotes having to pass through a G1\/S-phase checkpoint before the polarization axis can be fixed \u2013 the mechanisms behind\nthe interdependence of polarization and cell cycle progression remain unclear. In this study, we combine in vivo Ca2+ imaging, single\ncell monitoring of S-phase progression and multivariate analysis of high-throughput intracellular Ca2+ buffer loading to\ndemonstrate that Ca2+ signals coordinate polarization and cell cycle progression in the Fucus serratus zygote. Consistent with earlier\nstudies on this organism, and in contrast to animal models, we observe no fast Ca2+ wave following fertilization. Rather, we show\ndistinct slow localized Ca2+ elevations associated with both fertilization and S-phase progression, and we show that both S-phase\nand zygotic polarization are dependent on pre-S-phase Ca2+ increases. Surprisingly, this Ca2+ requirement cannot be explained by\nco-dependence on a single G1\/S-phase checkpoint, as S phase and zygotic polarization are differentially sensitive to pre-S-phase\nCa2+ elevations and can be uncoupled. Furthermore, subsequent cell cycle progression through M phase is independent of localized\nactin polymerization and zygotic polarization. This absence of a morphogenesis checkpoint, together with the observed Ca2+-\ndependences of S phase and polarization, show that the regulation of zygotic division in the brown algae differs from that in other\neukaryotic model systems, such as yeast and Drosophila.\nKEY WORDS: Ca2+, Cell cycle, Fucus serratus, PCNA, Polarization, Zygote\nDevelopment 135, 2173-2181 (2008) doi:10.1242\/dev.017558\n1Marine Biological Association of the UK, The Laboratory, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1\n2PB, UK. 2University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Institute of Cell and Molecular\nBiosciences, Medical School, Framlington Place, Newcastle NE2 4HH, UK.\n3Department of Biological Sciences, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster\nUniversity, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, UK.\n*Author for correspondence (e-mail: cbr@mba.ac.uk)\nAccepted 22 April 2008 D\nE\nV\nE\nLO\nP\nM\nE\nN\nT\n2174\nhave been limited by the highly pigmented nature and scattering\nproperties of the zygotes (Roberts et al., 1994), by difficulties in\nloading large numbers of eggs and zygotes with indicators or Ca2+\nbuffers, and by the absence of single cell markers for cell cycle\nevents in vivo (Corellou et al., 2000). To overcome these problems,\nwe use 2-photon microscopy and high-throughput biolistic loading\nto study how post-fertilization [Ca2+] elevations direct zygotic\ndevelopment. Our results suggest that distinct cytosolic and nuclear\n[Ca2+] elevations drive actin nucleation and cell cycle events, and\nthat these [Ca2+] elevations are temporally and spatially distinct from\nthe later polarizing [Ca2+] gradient. We also show that actin\nnucleation is essential for zygotic polarization, but not for cell cycle\nprogression, presenting a system of asymmetric cell division control\nthat is distinct from either the morphogenesis checkpoint-dominated\nyeast model or the uncoupled polarization and cell cycle model of\nDrosophila embryos.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPlant material and culture\nMature receptacles were cut from male and female Fucus serratus (L.)\nplants and dry stored at 4\u00b0C in the dark for up to 2 weeks. Gametes were\nreleased by placing male and female receptacles in separate dishes and\ncovering them with filtered (0.45 \u03bcm) seawater at 14\u00b0C. After 1-2 hours,\nreleased gametes were collected and eggs were either used for dye loading\nor mixed with sperm, with fertilization occurring within 15 minutes of\ngamete mixing. Eggs or zygotes were filtered through a 100 \u03bcm nylon mesh,\nwashed twice in filtered seawater, and maintained under unidirectional light\nat 14\u00b0C until use.\nGreen fluorescent protein\/proliferating cell nuclear antigen (GFP-\nPCNA) construct and fusion protein\nThe GFP fused to the human PCNA gene and containing SV40 Nuclear\nLocalization Signal at the N terminus was a kind gift from Dr C. Cardoso\n(Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany). The\nGFP-PCNA was subcloned into the BamHI\/SacI restriction sites of the\npCal-n expression vector and its correct insertion was verified by sequencing\nas previously described (Kisielewska et al., 2005; Philipova et al., 2005).\nThe GFP-PCNA protein was then expressed in BL21 competent E. coli cells\n(Promega; www.promega.com) cultured at 37\u00b0C. The protein was purified\non calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene; www.stratagene.com) according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nLoading cells with metal ion buffers and fluorescent markers\nAll dyes and Ca2+ buffers were from Invitrogen (www.invitrogen.com) or\nSigma (www.sigmaaldrich.com). The Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fura\ndextran (10 kDa; 4 mM), the Ca2+-insensitive dyes Texas Red dextran (10\nkDa; 4 mM) and fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC; 10 kDa; 20 mM),\nthe Ca2+ buffers BAPTA dextran (10 kDa; 20 mM) and dibromoBAPTA\n(Br2BAPTA; 40 mM), and the green fluorescent protein constructs GFP (5\nmg\/ml) and GFP-PCNA (3 mg\/ml) were coated onto gold particles (see\nbelow) and introduced in varying combinations into F. serratus eggs or\nzygotes using a biolistic method (Bothwell et al., 2006). Control experiments\nusing the cell-permeant heavy metal chelator N,N,N\u0002,N\u0002-tetrakis(2-\npyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) were conducted by supplementing\nthe perfusing medium with 1-100 \u03bcM TPEN or the equivalent amount of\nDMSO (0.2% w\/v).\nParameters for the biolistic loading protocol were, briefly, as follows:\n0.6 mg of 1.0 \u03bcm gold particles (Bio-Rad; www.bio-rad.com) were coated\nin the relevant solutions as previously described (Bothwell et al., 2006). If\nGFP-PCNA was being loaded, the macrocarriers were used immediately to\nprevent drying of the GFP-PCNA protein, otherwise macrocarriers were\ndried in a refrigerated drying chamber before use. Prior to biolistic loading,\nzygotes were transferred into filtered seawater supplemented with 0.6 M\nsorbitol. Around 100 \u03bcl of eggs or zygotes were then immediately\ntransferred in a dense suspension (>100,000 cells\/ml) to a 35 mm petri dish\ncontaining 3% seawater agar ~5 mm deep and subjected to biolistic\nbombardment using a 2200 psi rupture disc (Bothwell et al., 2006).\nAfter loading, zygotes were settled onto 35 mm culture dishes with 0.08-\n0.12 mm thick coverslip bases and left in filtered seawater under\nunidirectional light at 14\u00b0C until needed. Loaded eggs were left to recover\nin filtered seawater at 14\u00b0C for 1 hour before being mixed with sperm and\nwere treated as zygotes thereafter.\nTo confirm that GFP-PCNA was not denatured by biolistic loading, the\nlocalization pattern of biolistically loaded GFP-PCNA was compared with\nthat of biolistically loaded GFP (see Fig. S1A,B in the supplementary\nmaterial) or microinjected GFP-PCNA (see Fig. S1C-E in the supplementary\nmaterial). For microinjection, zygotes were superfused with filtered\nseawater supplemented with 0.7 M sorbitol to reduce internal turgor pressure\nand GFP-PCNA (3 mg\/ml in 200 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, 550 mM\nmannitol, pH 7.0) was pressure microinjected using dry bevelled pipettes\nfabricated from 1.2 mm filamented borosilicate glass (Taylor et al., 1996).\nNo significant difference was observed between the behaviour of GFP-\nPCNA introduced into zygotes by microinjection or biolistic loading (see\nFig. S1C-E in the supplementary material).\nFertilization assay\nCell wall secretion was monitored as a proxy for fertilization using 0.0001%\nCalcofluor white (CFW; Sigma) to stain cell wall cellulose. CFW\nfluorescence was monitored with either UV epifluorescence or 2-photon\nexcitation (see below).\nImaging of zygotic nuclei and sperm pronuclear motion\nTo quantify zygotic DNA levels during early development, zygotes were\nstained with 100 \u03bcM Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 15 minutes and nuclear\nDNA visualized using 2-photon microscopy (see below). To measure rates\nof sperm pronuclear motion, sperm were stained with 100 \u03bcM Hoechst\n33342 for 10 minutes and filtered through a 100 \u03bcm nylon mesh before\nbeing added to eggs. Progress of the sperm pronucleus through the egg\ncytoplasm was followed either with a graticule fitted to the eyepiece of an\nepifluorescence microscope (Swope and Kropf, 1993) or with 2-photon\nimaging (see below).\nF-actin staining\nZygotes were fixed in buffer (2.5 mM PIPES, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM EGTA,\n0.75 M sucrose, pH 7.0 containing 0.3 mM m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-\nhydroxysuccinimide ester and 3.7% formaldehyde) for 30 minutes, then\nwashed in filtered seawater and stained with 10 \u03bcM Texas Red-phalloidin\nfor 30 minutes, before being washed twice more in filtered seawater and\nimaged using confocal microscopy (see below).\nConfocal and 2-photon fluorescence microscopy\nDye-loaded cells were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal\/2-photon\nmicroscope (www.zeiss.com) and superfused using a gravity perfusion\nsystem. Loaded cells were imaged using a C-Apochromat 63\u0003\/1.2 n.a.\nwater-immersion objective. All images were processed using Zeiss LSM\nImage Examiner software or Scion Image (www.scioncorp.com).\nFor confocal imaging FITC was excited using the 488 nm line of an\nargon\/2 laser and Texas Red phalloidin excited using the 543 nm line, with\nemitted light bandpass filtered between 500-550 nm or 565-615 nm,\nrespectively. Pixel images (512\u0003512) were acquired in both cases, with\nfour-line averaging and a pixel dwell time of 2.56 \u03bcseconds.\nFor all other fluorophores, the Zeiss LSM 510 was used in 2-photon mode\nwith excitation provided by a tunable Titanium:Sapphire Mai Tai laser\n(Spectra Physics; www.spectraphysics.com). In all cases, 512\u0003512 pixel\nimages were acquired with a pixel dwell time of 2.56 \u03bcseconds and, unless\nstated, eight line summation. The CFW\/fura dextran\/Texas Red combination\nwas excited at 780 nm with emissions monitored at 405-458 nm, 501-554\nnm and 565-615 nm, respectively. Hoechst 33342 was excited at 765 nm and\nemitted light bandpass filtered between 435 and 485 nm. The GFP-\nPCNA\/Texas Red marker combination was excited at 925 nm with emitted\nlight bandpass filtered between 500-530 nm and 565-615 nm. DiOC6(3) was\nexcited at 950 nm, with emitted light bandpass filtered between 390-465 nm\nand 500-550 nm and using four-line averaging.\nTwo-photon excitation of fura dextran at 780 nm results in decreased\nfluorescence with increasing [Ca2+] (Wokosin et al., 2004) and [Ca2+] was\ncalculated from the Rmin and Rmax values of the Texas Red\/fura dextran\nRESEARCH ARTICLE Development 135 (12)\nD\nE\nV\nE\nLO\nP\nM\nE\nN\nT\nfluorescence ratio (R) values (Grynkiewicz et al., 1985). Dye-loaded cells\nwere superfused alternately with 50 mM Ca2+ seawater and Ca2+ free\nseawater (with 0.1 mM EGTA) in the presence of 100 \u03bcM ionomycin\n(Calbiochem; www.merckbiosciences.co.uk) to obtain Rmin and Rmax,\nrespectively. Nuclear fluorescence was quantified from projections of up to\n10 different confocal nuclear sections.\nQuantitative determination of cell division and polarization\nCa2+ buffer effects on cell cycle progression and zygotic polarization were\ncompared by measuring three parameters 24 hours after fertilization: first,\ncytosolic Ca2+ buffer concentration ([Ca2+ buffer]cyt; biolistically loaded\nbuffers were quantified by co-loaded FITC dextran fluorescence); second,\nthe length\/width ratio; and, third, a binary score reflecting cell cycle\nprogression, with 0=one nucleus and no M-phase entry and 1=two nuclei\nand M-phase entry.\nBinary scores were binomially distributed and were therefore plotted\nagainst [Ca2+ buffer]cyt and fitted in SYSTAT 11 (www.systat.com) to\nunconstrained logistic regressions of the form:\nwhere P is the relative rate of cell cycle progression and \u03b21 and \u03b20 are\nconstants reflecting the slope and intercept of the regression lines. The log-\nlikelihood G2 scores of these regressions were used to test the null\nhypothesis that the Ca2+ buffers did not affect cell cycle progression (Quinn\nand Keough, 2002).\nZygotic polarization in F. serratus is known to be S-phase dependent\n(Corellou et al., 2001b), so we used analysis of residuals to test a second null\nhypothesis: that Ca2+ buffers had no effects on polarization that could not be\nexplained by their effects on S-phase inhibition. As germinated rhizoids\nelongate at a constant rate for at least 24 hours after S-phase entry, it follows\nthat zygote length\/width ratios are directly proportional to cell cycle\nprogression rates. Accordingly, logistic regressions (above) were used to\npredict cell cycle rates in each zygote, given their [Ca2+ buffer]cyt. Predicted\nlength\/width values were then subtracted from the measured length\/width\nratios to give length\/width ratio residuals. Residuals were plotted against\n[Ca2+ buffer]cyt (see Fig. 5B,C) and linear regressions tested for deviations\nfrom the null model fit, i.e. the horizontal line passing through the origin.\nRESULTS\nGFP-PCNA can be used as a single-cell marker for\nDNA replication in Fucus serratus zygotes\nTo monitor post-fertilization DNA replication in individual F.\nserratus zygotes, we took advantage of the fact that, during S\nphase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) forms a highly\nconserved sliding clamp that is associated with active DNA\npolymerase (Moldovan et al., 2007). Nuclear accumulation of a\nGFP-PCNA chimera (Leonhardt et al., 2000) can, therefore, be\nused as a proxy assay for zygotic S-phase onset (Kisielewska et al.,\n2005).\nAs in sea urchin embryos (Philipova et al., 2005), F. serratus eggs\nthat were co-loaded with GFP-PCNA and the marker dye Texas Red\ndextran showed an initial nuclear localization of GFP-PCNA (Fig.\n1A), which remained constant for up to 2.5 hours after fertilization\n(Fig. 1B). From 3.5 hours onwards, the pattern of Texas Red dextran\nfluorescence remained unchanged, but the GFP-PCNA fluorescence\nin the nucleus began to increase relative to that in the cytosol,\nremaining significantly elevated (F>5.73, P<0.03) for up to 4.5\nhours after fertilization (Fig. 1A,B). The timing of the nuclear GFP-\nPCNA elevation \u2013 around 3 hours after fertilization \u2013 matches the\nonset of DNA replication, as measured by nuclear staining with the\nDNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 (see Fig. S2 in the supplementary\nmaterial) and broadly agrees with earlier work in populations of F.\nserratus zygotes, in which increases in Histone H1 kinase activity\nP =\n1\n1+ exp\u03b20 +\u03b21 x( )\nwere used as a marker for DNA replication to indicate that S-phase\nonset occurred around 4 hours after fertilization (Corellou et al.,\n2001a).\nAs the present study represents the first use of GFP-PCNA in a\nnon-animal system, we confirmed that nuclear GFP-PCNA\naccumulation reflected S-phase onset by noting that in sea urchin\nembryos the S-phase-associated nuclear accumulation of GFP-\nPCNA (Kisielewska et al., 2005) is reduced by the DNA polymerase\ninhibitor aphidicolin (Goscin and Byrnes, 1982; Ikegami et al.,\n1978). Accordingly, we confirmed that the post-fertilization increase\nin nuclear GFP-PCNA levels in F. serratus zygotes was completely\ninhibited (F=6.86, P<0.001) by aphidicolin (20 \u03bcM) applied\ncontinuously from 30 minutes after fertilization (Fig. 1C; see also\nFig. S2 in the supplementary material). Taken together, these data\nshow that GFP-PCNA can be used as a robust marker of S phase in\nindividual F. serratus zygotes.\nDistinct cytosolic and nuclear [Ca2+] elevations\naccompany fertilization and pronuclear fusion in\nF. serratus zygotes\nTo investigate whether [Ca2+] elevations are associated with early\nembryogenesis in F. serratus, we used 2-photon measurement of\nbiolistically co-loaded Texas Red\/fura dextran ratios to monitor\ncellular [Ca2+] during the first 3 hours of development.\nThe first visible sign of fertilization and egg activation was the\npolarized secretion of cell wall components, which progressed\naround the zygote at around 90\u00b110\u00b0\/minute (n=8; linear regression\nwith R2=0.95\u00b10.02) and thus enclosed the zygote within 5 minutes\n(Fig. 2A). This was followed by a 30 minute rise in cytosolic and\n2175RESEARCH ARTICLEZygotic Ca2+ signalling\nFig. 1. GFP-PCNA is a single-cell marker of S phase in Fucus\nserratus zygotes.

We did\nnot observe any fast cytosolic [Ca2+] waves or polarized [Ca2+]\nelevations matching the polarized pattern of cell wall secretion.\nThe sperm pronucleus moved towards the egg pronucleus at a\nsteady rate of 0.31\u00b10.02 \u03bcm\/minute (n=8; linear regression with\nR2=0.96\u00b10.02) at 18-19\u00b0C (Fig. 2B,C), which compares with earlier\nestimates of 0.20\u00b10.06 \u03bcm\/minute at 14\u00b0C in the brown alga Silvetia\ncompressa (Swope and Kropf, 1993). Given this rate of pronuclear\nmigration, fusion of the sperm and egg pronuclei would have\noccurred from 2-3 hours after fertilization (Fig. 2B,C) and our\nresults in Fig. 1 are consistent with S phase beginning after\npronuclear fusion. Such post-pronuclear fusion onset of S phase has\nbeen proposed in sea urchin eggs (Longo and Plunkett, 1973),\nalthough more recent studies have shown that both PCNA\n(Kisielewska et al., 2005; Philipova et al., 2005) and the S phase\ncyclin E and cdk2 (Moreau et al., 1998; Schnackenberg and\nMarzluff, 2002) localize to male and female sea urchin pronuclei\nimmediately after fertilization, suggesting that DNA replication may\nbegin slightly before pronuclear fusion in some organisms.\nAfter the sperm pronucleus reached the egg pronucleus, a rise in\nnuclear, but not in cytosolic, [Ca2+] was apparent, increasing to a\npeak of less than 300 nM in late G1\/S phase, between 2 and 3 hours\nafter fertilization (Fig. 2C,D).\nInhibition of post-fertilization [Ca2+] elevations\ndoes not affect pronuclear motion, but does\nsuppress both actin nucleation and DNA replication\nTo determine whether the [Ca2+] changes seen in Fig. 2 are required\nfor zygotic polarization or cell cycle progression, we introduced the\nCa2+ buffer, BAPTA dextran (0.4-0.8 mM), into zygotes before S-\nphase onset (between 30 minutes and 1 hour after fertilization), and\nmonitored subsequent pronuclear motion, actin nucleation and\nnuclear GFP-PCNA localization (Fig. 3).\nBAPTA dextran had no effect (F=4.54, P<0.32) on sperm\npronuclear motion, with sperm pronuclei migrating towards egg\npronuclei at 0.22\u00b10.03 \u03bcm\/minute in FITC dextran-loaded eggs\n(n=10) and 0.26\u00b10.02 \u03bcm\/minute (n=7) in BAPTA dextran-loaded\neggs (Fig. 3A,B).\nUntreated control zygotes showed both polarization and polarized\nactin nucleation (Fig. 3C), but loading zygotes with BAPTA dextran\n(Fig. 3D) inhibited both zygotic polarization and the cortical actin\nnucleation on which polarization depends (Hable and Kropf, 2000;\nPu et al., 2000).\nFinally, BAPTA dextran significantly inhibited (F>5.82, P<0.05)\nS-phase onset, as measured by nuclear GFP-PCNA accumulation\n(Fig. 3F).\nBecause previous work has shown that inhibition of CDK activity\nhad a similar effect to our BAPTA dextran studies on zygotic\npolarization (Corellou et al., 2001b) and DNA replication (Corellou\net al., 2001a), we treated zygotes with the cyclin-dependent kinase\ninhibitor olomoucine (100 \u03bcM) continuously from 20 minutes after\nfertilization. Olomoucine did not prevent cortical actin nucleation\n(Fig. 3E), although it did prevent polarization. This inability of\nolomoucine to mimic the full effect of BAPTA dextran suggests that\nseparate Ca2+ dependencies may exist for actin nucleation and the\nG1\/S phase checkpoint. This hypothesis is discussed further in the\nfinal Results section, below.\nCell cycle progression is not dependent on cortical\nactin nucleation\nTo investigate whether actin nucleation or localization are necessary\nfor DNA replication and to determine whether the inhibitory effect\nof the Ca2+ buffer BAPTA dextran on DNA replication was mediated\nthrough inhibition of actin nucleation, we studied the effects of\ncytoskeletal actin disruption on cell cycle progression.\nThe actin depolymerizing agent, latrunculin B, inhibited zygotic\npolarization (F=45.14, P<0.001) (Fig. 4B,F) relative to controls (Fig.\n4A,F) at all concentrations tested when applied continuously from 20\nminutes after fertilization. Surprisingly, bearing in mind the yeast\nmorphogenesis checkpoint, zygotes underwent complete mitosis in\nthe presence of 0.1 \u03bcM latrunculin B, at a rate that was not\nsignificantly different (F=0.01, P<0.92) from that of untreated zygotes\n(Fig. 4E), to give apolar binucleate zygotes (Fig. 4B).

To provide further\nevidence for the importance of post-fertilization Ca2+ signals,\nzygotes were loaded either before S phase (1 hour after fertilization)\nor after S phase [7 hours after fertilization (Corellou et al., 2001b)]\nwith one of four separate treatments: the high affinity (Kd ~200 nM)\nCa2+ buffer BAPTA dextran together with FITC dextran; the\nmoderate affinity (Kd ~1.4 \u03bcM) Ca2+ buffer Br2BAPTA together\nwith FITC dextran; FITC dextran alone; or the very low affinity (Kd\n~40 \u03bcM) Ca2+ buffer \u2013 but very high affinity transition metal buffer\n\u2013 TPEN (Arslan et al., 1985).\nIn full support of our single-cell imaging results (Figs 2 and 3),\nlogistic regressions fitted to these data (G2 relative to full\nmodel=1.51, P=0.22) show that both moderate and high-affinity\nCa2+ buffers \u2013 Br2BAPTA and BAPTA dextran \u2013 preferentially\ninhibit cell cycle progression when added before S phase, with\nBAPTA dextran being significantly more effective than Br2BAPTA\n(Fig. 5A).\nAlthough we have used BAPTA dextran and Br2BAPTA as Ca\n2+\nbuffers, they also show reasonably high affinities for other biologically\nimportant species: notably H+ and the heavy metal ion Zn2+.

Consistent with our hypothesis\nthat the S-phase-specific effects of BAPTA-based buffers are\nmediated through Ca2+ binding, we did not observe preferential pre-\nS-phase cell cycle inhibition at TPEN concentrations with heavy metal\nbuffering capacities equivalent to the BAPTA dextran and Br2BAPTA\nconcentrations used in the present study (Fig. 5A) (Kao et al., 1990).\nPolarization and cell cycle progression show\ndifferential pre-S-phase Ca2+ requirements\nOur single-cell imaging results show that Ca2+ buffers inhibit S-\nphase entry (Fig. 3F) and zygotic polarization (Fig. 3D) when\nintroduced before S phase. Because S-phase entry and zygotic\npolarization in F. serratus are also dependent on late G1\/S-phase\nCDK activity (Corellou et al., 2001b), it is possible that pre-S-phase\nCa2+ elevations act solely to stimulate CDK activity (see also results\nfor Fig. 3E, above). As no single-cell assay has been developed to\nmeasure CDK activity in individual F. serratus zygotes, it was not\npossible to test this hypothesis directly. Instead, we used multivariate\nanalysis of residual length\/width ratios (see Materials and methods)\nto assess the degree to which polarization and cell cycle progression\nrelied on a common Ca2+-dependent process.\nThe measured length-to-width ratios for FITC- or Br2BAPTA-\nloaded populations do not differ significantly (F<0.42, P>0.52)\nfrom the predicted values for full dependence of polarization on\ncell cycle progression, regardless of the time at which buffer was\nloaded into zygotes (Fig. 5B,C). FITC- and Br2BAPTA-loaded\nzygotes that had reached M phase had, therefore, invariably\npolarized (Fig. 5D). However, BAPTA dextran loaded before S\nphase inhibited zygotic polarization (F=9.11, P<0.01) to a degree\nthat could not be entirely explained by the effect of BAPTA\ndextran on cell cycle rate alone (Fig. 5B) and that, at its most\nextreme, manifested itself as a complete uncoupling of nuclear\ndivision and polarization (Fig. 5D). Crucially, this additional\ninhibitory effect was not observed (Fig. 5C,D) when BAPTA\ndextran was loaded after S phase, 7 hours after fertilization\n(F=0.712, P=0.492), ruling out effects on post-S-phase Ca2+\ndynamics, such as inhibition of the tip-high cytosolic [Ca2+]\ngradient which arises just prior to rhizoid germination (Berger and\nBrownlee, 1993).\nThe heavy metal buffer TPEN was again used as a control and\nadditionally inhibited polarization (F>24.65, P<0.001) when\napplied either before or after S phase (Fig. 5B-D), providing\nfurther evidence for an S-phase-specific Ca2+-mediated signalling\nevent, as inhibited by BAPTA dextran, as opposed to a general\nnutrient requirement for polarized growth, as inhibited by TPEN.\nTaken together, the simplest explanation for our data is one in\nwhich post-fertilization Ca2+ elevations trigger both the G1\/S-phase\ncheckpoint and a separate, G1\/S-phase checkpoint-independent,\nRESEARCH ARTICLE Development 135 (12)\nFig. 5.

Both processes are required for zygotic\npolarization, but the G1\/S-phase checkpoint stimulates cell cycle\nprogression on its own (Fig. 6A). Given our single-cell imaging\nresults (Fig. 3), the most obvious candidate for the second, G1\/S-\nphase checkpoint-independent, pathway is cortical actin nucleation,\nwhich is known to be required for zygotic polarization (Pu et al.,\n2000) and which we have shown to be Ca2+ dependent (Fig. 3D), but\nnot CDK dependent (Fig. 3E). The observed uncoupling of cell\ncycle progression from polarization (Fig. 5B,D) also confirms the\nsingle-cell imaging results of Fig. 4 in indicating that there is no\nactin-based morphogenesis checkpoint for cell cycle progression in\nthe F. serratus zygote.\nDISCUSSION\nSingle cell markers are needed to study\nembryogenic [Ca2+] signalling\nPrevious studies on cell cycle regulation in F. serratus zygotes\nhave used whole-population assays to measure S-phase\nprogression (Corellou et al., 2000) and CDK activity (Corellou et\nal., 2001b). Unfortunately, these bulk assays are not appropriate\nfor intracellular Ca2+ signalling studies, because Ca2+ buffers and\nindicators may only be loaded into a small fraction of the cells\npresent in a population (Bothwell et al., 2006). To circumvent\nthese problems in F. serratus zygotes, we have adapted a GFP-\nPCNA single-cell assay for DNA replication (Figs 1, 3) and have\nused statistical analyses of polarization and cell cycle progression\nto test models of coupling between Ca2+-dependent\ndevelopmental pathways (Fig. 5).\nZygotes of F. serratus display a slow, global, post-\nfertilization [Ca2+]cyt elevation\nIn all eukaryotic systems studied to date, fertilization is accompanied\nby intracellular [Ca2+] elevations. In animal systems, these\nelevations generally take the form of fast [Ca2+]cyt waves (Gilkey et\nal., 1978), which cross the newly fertilized egg at concentrations\nbetween 2 \u03bcM (Miyazaki, 1989) and10 \u03bcM (Brownlee and Dale,\n1990; Speksnijder et al., 1990), and at speeds of around 10\n\u03bcm\/second (Jaffe and Creton, 1998). These fast [Ca2+]cyt waves\ntrigger two groups of events: zygote construction and cell cycle re-\nactivation (Rauh et al., 2005; Whitaker, 2006a).\nEvidence for such large and fast [Ca2+]cyt waves has, however, been\nless forthcoming in non-animal systems, with slower [Ca2+]cyt wave\nspeeds of only around 1 \u03bcm\/second having been recorded during in\nvitro fertilization in maize (Antoine et al., 2000; Digonnet et al., 1997)\nand with only localized cortical [Ca2+]cyt elevations of around 300 nM\nhaving been previously reported in F. serratus (Roberts et al., 1994).\nHere, we have used two-photon excitation for better depth\npenetration (Bush et al., 2007) into the highly pigmented F.\nserratus zygote to reveal the presence of a slow global post-\nfertilization [Ca2+]cyt elevation (Fig. 2C,D). The polarized\nsecretion of cell wall components that occurs within the first few\nminutes of fertilization may also indicate the presence of a low\namplitude \u2018fast\u2019, post-fertilization cortical [Ca2+]cyt wave,\npossibly arising from the site of sperm entry, and we cannot\nexclude the possibility that we have been unable to detect such a\n[Ca2+]cyt elevation in F. serratus zygotes. However, the pattern\nof slow, global [Ca2+]cyt elevation that we report here had a\nsimilar time course to the more localized [Ca2+]cyt elevations\npreviously reported (Roberts et al., 1994) and is consistent with\nthe slow [Ca2+]cyt elevations known to be associated with\ndevelopmental events in a number of other organisms (Jaffe and\nCreton, 1998).\nZygotic S phase is Ca2+ dependent in F. serratus\nWe have demonstrated that BAPTA-based buffers are able to inhibit\nS phase (Fig. 3F) by buffering Ca2+ (Fig. 5A). This Ca2+ dependency\nof zygotic S phase comes after the sperm pronucleus has migrated\nto the egg pronucleus (Fig. 3A,B), but before any measurable DNA\nreplication (Fig. 3F), and strongly suggests a Ca2+ signalling\nrequirement for S-phase onset.\nF. serratus eggs, like sea urchin eggs and somatic cells, are arrested\nin G0\/G1 (Corellou et al., 2001a) and must be driven into S phase\nfollowing fertilization. This task is performed by the cyclin E-cdk2\ncomplex in somatic cells (Dulic et al., 1992; Koff et al., 1992) and\nprobably in sea urchin embryos (Schnackenberg and Marzluff, 2002).\nIt is, therefore, interesting to note that [Ca2+] elevations are able to\nactivate both partners in the sea urchin cyclin E-cdk2 complex.

Regulatory\nprocesses are represented by magenta circles and broken magenta\narrows (see text for details). (B) The present study suggests that\nregulation of zygotic development in F. serratus is accomplished by a\nsystem of checkpoints that lie intermediate between those of the\ntightly coupled budding yeast (C) and the loosely coupled Drosophila\nembryo (D). Zygotic polarization and cell cycle progression in F. serratus\nare coordinated by Ca2+ dependent processes, but there is no\ndependence of the cell cycle on polarization. (C) In budding yeast, cell\ncycle progression and polarization are made interdependent by the\nG1\/S checkpoint and the morphogenesis checkpoint. (D) In Drosophila\nembryos, cell cycle progression and zygotic polarization are\nindependent, run in parallel and may be uncoupled from each other by\ninhibitor treatments.\nD\nE\nV\nE\nLO\nP\nM\nE\nN\nT\n2180\ncyclins, Ca2+-dependent PKC can switch on a Na\/H antiporter (Epel,\n1990; Swann and Whitaker, 1985), which alkalinizes the zygote\ncytosol (Johnson and Epel, 1976) and leads to pH-dependent cyclin\nsynthesis (Grainger et al., 1979; Winkler et al., 1980). For CDKs,\n[Ca2+] elevations trigger the MAP kinase ERK1 (Philipova and\nWhitaker, 1998), which is thought to activate cdk2 to bind the cyclin\nE complex (Philipova et al., 2005). Similar MAPK activation is also\nneeded for cdk2 activity in somatic cells (Keenan et al., 2001).\nDespite this potential involvement of Ca2+ in driving cells out of\nG0\/G1 arrest, [Ca2+] elevations associated with pronuclear fusion or\nS-phase onset have not been well documented. There is some\nevidence that [Ca2+] elevations are associated with embryonic S-phase\nonset in sea urchins (Poenie et al., 1985) and [Ca2+] elevations are\nrequired for, but have not been visualized in, somatic S-phase (Kao et\nal., 1990), leading to the suggestion that they may be restricted to\nmicrodomains (Whitaker, 2006b). Our observation of a localized\nnuclear [Ca2+] elevation around the time of pronuclear fusion (Fig.\n2D) offers some support for this microdomain suggestion.\nFurthermore, we propose that the timing of [Ca2+] elevations may\nhave a bearing on the timing of other cell cycle regulatory events.\nFor example, sea urchin zygotes enter S-phase around 20 minutes\nafter fertilization and an immediate post-fertilization Ca2+ wave may\nbe sufficient to activate their cyclin E-cdk2 complexes, which are\npresent in an inactive state before fertilization. F. serratus zygotes,\nhowever, not only have much slower rates of cell cycle progression,\nbut also demonstrate a unique translational regulation of CDKs,\nwhich are not synthesized until several hours after fertilization\n(Corellou et al., 2001a). This suggests that any immediate post-\nfertilization [Ca2+] elevation could not lead to subsequent S-phase\nactivation by Ca2+-dependent MAP kinase stimulation of cdk2-\ncyclin, as the CDK partner would not be present. This may explain\nthe need for a later, more prolonged [Ca2+] elevation of the type\nreported in Fig. 2D.\nPre-S-phase [Ca2+] elevations co-ordinate zygotic\npolarization and cell cycle progression\nIt is tempting to speculate that the post-fertilization [Ca2+]cyt\nelevation that we have observed (Fig. 2C,D) acts to trigger one set\nof zygote activation events, such as actin nucleation (Muto and\nMikoshiba, 1998), and the later nuclear Ca2+ elevation (Fig. 2C,D)\nacts to trigger another set, such as cell cycle progression.\nNonetheless, although our Ca2+ buffer loading results suggest that\nthe post-fertilization [Ca2+]cyt elevation is not sufficient to drive S\nphase, the roles played by distinct Ca2+ elevations remain to be\ndetermined. Our results do, however, suggest that such distinct Ca2+-\ndependent pathways exist (Figs 3, 5) and the simplest model for our\ndata is one in which actin nucleation and the G1\/S-phase checkpoint\nhave independent Ca2+ requirements (Fig. 6A).\nAbsence of a morphogenesis checkpoint for cell\ncycle progression\nIn budding yeast, the joint activation of cell cycle progression and\npolarization by the G1\/S-phase checkpoint is followed by their\nfurther coordination at the well-established morphogenesis\ncheckpoint, in which actin localization at the bud collar is needed to\nbring about release of cell cycle arrest at G2\/M (Keaton and Lew,\n2006). However, our results clearly indicate that a morphogenesis\ncheckpoint does not operate in the F. serratus zygote. The evidence\nfor this is twofold. First, exogenous Ca2+ buffers are able to inhibit\nactin localization and zygotic polarization while allowing cell\ndivision, albeit at relatively low frequencies (Fig. 5D), which\nindicates that there is no absolute requirement for an actin-\nlocalization based checkpoint. Second, there is no effect on cell\ncycle progression to M phase when actin polymerization is inhibited\nsufficiently to block polarization completely (Fig. 4), which is both\ndirect evidence against the involvement of a morphogenesis\ncheckpoint and a surprising finding, given the demonstrated ability\nof actin to regulate developmental Ca2+ elevations in F. serratus\nzygotes (Pu et al., 2000).\nThe absence of a strict actin-based polarity checkpoint in the F.\nserratus zygote presents a developmental model (Fig. 6B) that is\ndistinct from both the tightly controlled yeast morphogenesis system\n(Fig. 6C) and that of Drosophila, in which early embryonic cell\ncycle checkpoints are absent (Fig. 6D). This emphasises the\ndiversity of cell cycle control in relation to polarization in different\norganisms.\nWe are grateful to the BBSRC and NERC for financial support. M.
