L.1 and Badge R. M.2\n1School of Biological Sciences, University of Leicester, 2 Department of Genetics, University \nof Leicester\nDate received: 10\/07\/09 Date accepted:xx\/xx\/xx \nHere we report a case study where Blackboard\u2019s wiki function was used to create electronic \nlab books for the supervision of undergraduate students completing laboratory based research \nprojects. \nAt the University of Leicester, in August 2008, Dr Richard Badge created an electronic lab book \nto replace his own paper lab book. Contained within a specific Blackboard module, it utilises \nthe campus learning objects wiki tool (www.learningobjects.com\/teams.jsp). Users of the wiki \ncan create new pages, edit other user\u2019s pages and leave comments. All actions are username \nand date stamped.  The editing tool enables simple word processing, the creation of tables \nand the insertion of images. The system is secure, in that it is hosted within the VLE and can \nbe accessed only by specified University account holders. There are daily, system-wide VLE \nback-ups at institutional level, and weekly back-ups held locally by Dr Badge.\nThe wiki system provides certain functions that are either impossible or convoluted to perform \nwith paper. For example, when re-using common protocols, either a hyperlink can be inserted \nto refer to a methods page or the protocol can be copied and pasted into a new page. Since \nall lab members can view and edit all the wiki pages, protocols and data can be easily shared \nonline at any time.\nAt the University of Leicester, Biological Sciences undergraduates complete a 30-day research \nproject in the first semester of their third year worth 40 credits. Most students undertake the \nlaboratory research during October and November. They then give a short oral presentation in \nMarch and submit their final written reports at the beginning of May.\nIn 2008\/09 Richard Badge supervised two undergraduate project students. The students had \naccess to networked computers at the end of each bench. They were encouraged to plan \ntheir experiments on the wiki, write up the protocol and then print a copy to work with at the \nbench. Any changes to the paper protocol were transferred back to the wiki. The students \nundertook molecular biology projects that involved PCR genotyping, long range PCR, PCR \nproduct purification and sequencing of DNA from humans or chimpanzees. As a result much \nof their data comprised digital photographs of agarose gels, which could be inserted directly \ninto wiki pages.\nAnalysis of the students\u2019 use of the wiki was carried out using a combination of Blackboard \ntracking systems and the wiki revision history. Overall, student 1 used the wiki to a much \ngreater extent than student 2, with double the number of recorded visits to the Blackboard site \nover the period 1 October 2008 to 6 May 2009.  \nVolume 14: December 2009 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol14\/beej-14-c1pdf\nFigure 1 Student 1 blackboard access statistics from 1 October 2008 to 6 May 2009\nFigure 2 Student 2 blackboard access statistics from 1 October 2008 to 6 May 2009\nPeaks in access can be seen during the main phases of the project (see figures 1 and 2): \nlaboratory phase of the project (October and November)1. \nfinal tidying of data in January2. \naccess prior to the oral presentation in March3. \npreparation of written report during April 4. \nfinal submission of the written report on 5 May5. \nStudent 1 kept a daily log of activity on the wiki and accessed the wiki when not present in the \nlab. Student one created 49 separate pages on 49 separate days. Student 2 worked within two \npages of the wiki, adding to them 54 times on 29 separate days.\nVolume 14: December 2009 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol14\/beej-14-c1pdf\nThe students were limited in their time in the lab by their timetables and restrictions to work \nunder supervised conditions during normal working hours. This is largely reflected in when they \naccessed the wiki, though it is clear that they also accessed the system from other computers \noutside of the lab (see figures 3 and 4). It was noted that most commonly both students were \nin the lab on Tuesdays and Thursdays due to gaps in their timetables on these days. Again, \nthis is reflected in their access of the Blackboard site (see figs 5 and 6).\nThe supervisor met with the students every week to review their progress and accessed their \nwiki lab books prior to each meeting.  The supervisor\u2019s office was not adjacent to the lab, \nand so online access to the student\u2019s lab books facilitated supervision without the need for \nincreased physical presence in the lab. \nAs neither of these students had carried out a research project using a recording method other \nthan the wiki, it is impossible to compare their performance with students using traditional paper \nlab books. However it appeared that the students were generally more diligent in annotating \ngel photographs in the wiki than previous students had been when using paper copies and \ntheir methods were more clearly recorded from the very beginning of the project. \nThis successful experiment in supervision using electronic notebooks provided a searchable \nrecord of student work and a permanent online record of student data, which has been retained \nto inform future projects. Tracking student progress was facilitated by automated date and time \nstamping of wiki entries.  The students benefitted from a significant reduction of transcription \nerrors in writing up results, better record keeping, off campus access to and secure back-ups \nof their results.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\nH\nit\ns\nhour of day\nFigure 3 Time of access to lab Blackboard site by hour \nfor student 1 \nFigure 4 Time of access to lab Blackboard site by hour \nfor student 2 \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\nH\nit\ns\nhour of day\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n35%\nSUN MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT \npe\nrc\nen\nta\nge\n o\nf v\nis\nits\nday of week\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\nSUN MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT \npe\nrc\nen\nta\nge\n o\nf v\nis\nits\nday of week\nFigure 5 Access of lab Blackboard site by day of the \nweek for student 1 (percentage of visits\/ day of week)\nFigure 6 Access of lab Blackboard site by day of the \nweek for student 2 (percentage of visits\/ day of week)\nVolume 14: December 2009 \nwww.bioscience.heacademy.ac.uk\/journal\/vol14\/beej-14-c1pdf\nCommunicating  author \nDr Richard Badge, Department of Genetics, Adrian Building, University of Leicester.
