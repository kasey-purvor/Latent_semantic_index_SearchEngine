Over the years the volume of experimental works has increased to such an extent that it\ncannot even be listed in a review of this kind. As examples, we mention only a fundamental\npaper by Reynolds [2], where elegant experiments with stained liquid were described\nand intermittent behavior was first discovered, the Compte-Bellot\u2019s book [3], wherein a\ndetailed comparison is made between turbulence power spectra in a plane channel and\nKolmogorov\u2019s spectra, and the book by Ginevsky et al. [4] in which experiments with\njets are reviewed. A wide variety of books is devoted to the problem of hydrodynamic\ninstability playing the major role in the transition to turbulence (see, e.g. [5\u201310]). Among\nthe many general texts we mention [11\u201317]. A number of books and a plethora of papers\nare devoted to numerical calculations of turbulence by both direct and indirect methods\n(see, e.g. the books [18\u201321]). An important place in the literature is occupied by studies\nin which the general properties of so-called fully developed turbulence are derived and\ninvestigated. Thus Kolmogorov and Obukhov [22\u201324], for example, derived the power\nspectra of developed isotropic turbulence starting from simple dimensional arguments\n(see also [25]). Different generalizations and refinements of these results were achieved by\nNovikov [26], Procaccia et al. [27\u201336], Amati et al. [37] and many other researchers. Recent\nworks, developing an approach to turbulence in the context of contemporary theoretical\nphysics, including field-theoretic and group-theoretic methods, can be also assigned to\nthis class. Among these we mention [38\u201340].\nIt is known that, as distinct from flows in channels, jet flows are rarely, if ever, laminar.\nOver a wide range of Reynolds numbers, so-called hydrodynamic waves are excited and\namplified in the body of the jet. The amplitude of these waves decreases exponentially out-\nside the jet shear layer. Undamped hydrodynamic waves can propagate only downstream\nwith a velocity of the order of the flow velocity. The distinctive feature of hydrodynamic\nwaves is their random character. Nevertheless, against the background of this randomness\nthere are comparatively regular large scale patterns known as coherent structures.\n3\nIt is very important to note that, when hydrodynamic waves interact with an obstacle\nor inhomogeneity, they do not undergo simple reflection. Rather, they induce acoustic\nwaves that propagate upstream. The acoustic waves coming up against an obstacle or\nan inhomogeneity, in their turn, induce hydrodynamic waves propagating downstream,\nand so on. Owing to these transformations feedback occurs in jet flows, and can excite\nself-oscillations. Just such a phenomenon arises in jets impinging upon e.g. a flat plate,\na wedge, a coaxial ring or a coaxial pipe [41\u201345]. In free jets inhomogeneities formed by\nvortices also induce acoustic waves, again resulting in feedback [46]. But this feedback is\nnonlinear, and it cannot cause the self-excitation of oscillations. Nonetheless, it exerts an\ninfluence on the development of turbulence and coherent structures.\nAs will be shown below, the turbulent character of jet flows is caused by strong amplifica-\ntion of the random disturbances which are always present at the jet nozzle exit section 1 .\nAt a certain distance from the nozzle the amplification becomes inherently nonlinear.\nThe amplification transforms the system to a qualitatively new state which depends only\nslightly on the power spectrum or other characteristics of the input disturbances. The\nsystem behaves much as though it had undergone a phase transition.\nThe hypothesis that the onset of turbulence can usefully be considered as a noise-induced\nphase transition was first offered in [47]. It was based on the existence of profound parallels\nbetween turbulent processes in nonclosed fluid flows and noise-induced oscillations in a\npendulum with a randomly vibrated suspension axis, which undergoes such a phase tran-\nsition [44,45,48\u201351]. Note that this hypothesis is in contradistinction with the widespread\nbelief that the transition to turbulence arises through the excitation of self-oscillations,\nfirst periodic and then chaotic [11,12]; but the latter idea does not explain the origin of\nthe feedback mechanism responsible for exciting the self-oscillations. It is well known that\ninstability in a nonclosed fluid flows is of a convective character, but not absolute. Such\nan instability cannot excite self-oscillations because all disturbances drift downstream 2 .\n1 It should be noted that random sources are present at all points of a jet, even with no external\ndisturbances \u2014 i.e. the so called natural fluctuations [16]. But their influence is significantly less\nthan that of disturbances at the jet nozzle exit section and they can therefore be ignored.\n2 It should be noted, however, that the instability of a jet flow in counter-current stream is of\nan absolute character and can result in self-excited oscillations.\n4\nAn extremely interesting manifestation of nonlinear effects in jets lies in the possibil-\nity of exploiting them to control turbulence with the aid of acoustic waves applied at\nsome appropriate frequency ([4,52\u201357]. Similar control of noise-induced oscillations was\ndemonstrated for the harmonically driven pendulum [58,51].\nThrough an approximate solution of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations based on the Krylov\u2013\nBogolyubov asymptotic method, we will show that explicit consideration of the amplifica-\ntion of the input noise allows us to account for many known experimental results within\nthe initial part of a jet [59]. Moreover, it follows from our theory that the commonly\naccepted [60\u201365,21,4] explanation for the well-known shift of velocity pulsation power\nspectra towards the low-frequency region is in fact erroneous. According to this expla-\nnation, the shift of the power spectra occurs because of feedback via an acoustic wave\nnascent where vortex pairing occurs, as seen in experiments. We will show that the reason\nfor the spectral shift lies in the jet\u2019s divergence; and that this shift causes the increase of\nspatial scale with increasing distance from the nozzle, and results in the observed vortex\npairing.\nIt should be noted that interesting phenomena similar to those for ordinary hydrodynamic\nturbulence are also observed in flows of superfluid helium [66].\n2 Brief review of the evolution of views of turbulence as an oscillatory process\nIt is well known that fluid flow in channels is laminar for small flow velocities and turbulent\nfor large flow velocities [11,12,9]. The problem of how turbulence originates has long\nattracted the considerable attention of researchers. As is known from the Rytov memoirs\n[67], the Russian physicist Gorelik believed that\n\u201c...turbulence with its threshold of \u2018self-excitation\u2019, with typical hysteresis in its ap-\npearance or disappearance as the flow velocity increases or decreases, with paramount\nimportance of nonlinearity for its developed (stationary) state \u2014 is self-oscillations.\nTheir specific character lies in that they are self-oscillations in a continuous medium,\ni.e. in a system with very large number of degrees of freedom.\u201d\n5\nLandau held implicitly the same viewpoint. According to Landau turbulence appears\nin the following manner: first the equilibrium state corresponding to laminar flow be-\ncomes unstable and self-oscillations with a single frequency are excited. To describe the\namplitude of these self-oscillations, based on physical considerations, Landau wrote a phe-\nnomenological equation similar to the truncated van der Pol equation for the amplitude of\nself-oscillations in a vacuum tube generator, commenting [68]: \u201cWith further increase of\nthe Reynolds number new periods appear sequentially. As for the newly appeared motions,\nthey have increasingly small scales\u201d. As a result, multi-frequency self-oscillations with in-\ncommensurate frequencies, i.e. quasi-periodic motion, must set in. An attractor in the form\nof a multi-dimensional torus in the system phase space has to be associated with these\nself-oscillations. For a large number of frequencies such quasi-periodic self-oscillations dif-\nfer little in appearance from chaotic ones, which is why developed turbulence is perceived\nas a random process. In spite of the fact that Landau\u2019s theory was phenomenological, and\ndid not follow from hydrodynamic equations, it was accepted without question for a long\ntime by almost all turbulence researchers. Moreover, this theory was further developed\nby Stuart [69\u201372] who proposed a technique for calculating the coefficients involved in\nthe Landau equations, based on an approximate solution of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\nHowever, the approximate solution sought by Stuart in the form of A(\u01ebt)ei(\u03c9t\u2212kx) is, from\na physical standpoint, incorrect. It describes a wave that is periodic in space, with a given\nwave number k and with a slowly time varying amplitude A(\u01ebt). Strictly speaking such a\nsolution is true only for a ring flow of length L = 2\u03c0n\/k, where n is an integer, i.e. for\na flow with feedback. We note that a similar approach to hydrodynamic instability was\nused by many scientists, beginning from Heisenberg [73].\nIn the 1970s, after the discovery of the phenomenon of deterministic chaos and the real-\nization that a multi-dimensional torus is unstable [74], the Landau theory became open\nto question, but the conception of self-oscillations was retained. The difference lay only\nin that, instead of quasi-periodic self-oscillations, they became spoken of as chaotic ones.\nThus, according to these new ideas, the onset of turbulence is the sudden birth of a strange\nattractor in the phase space of certain dynamical variables [74,75]. We note that similar\nideas were repeatedly expressed by Neimark (see [76]). Using the concept of turbulence as\nself-oscillations, Gaponov-Grekhov and with co-workers published several articles on the\n6\nsimulation of turbulence, modelled in a chain of coupled oscillators [77,78].\nHowever, we believe that turbulence arising in nonclosed fluid flows is not a self-oscillatory\nprocess. As already mentioned above, the instability of nonclosed laminar flows is of a con-\nvective character but not absolute. This means that a disturbance arising at some point of\nthe flow will not increase indefinitely with time, but will drift downstream. It follows from\nthis property of convectively unstable systems that they are not self-oscillatory, but are\namplifiers of disturbances 3 . For such a system to become self-oscillatory, global feedback\nmust be introduced, e.g. by closing the system in a ring 4 . Disturbances are necessarily\npresent in all real systems, both from external sources (technical fluctuations) and as a\nresult of the molecular structure of a substance (natural fluctuations). The disturbances\ncan be included as external forces in equations describing the system behavior. The cal-\nculation of the forces caused by the natural fluctuations in hydrodynamic flows, based\non the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, was performed by Klimontovich [16]. In hydrody-\nnamic flows the presence of fluctuations, especially at the input, is crucial because they\nare precisely what lead eventually to the turbulent disturbances observed. It follows from\nthis that an approach to turbulence within the framework of (deterministic) dynamical\nsystems theory is not always appropriate.\nNaturally, the question arises as to how to treat the features of turbulence which, as\npointed out by Gorelik, are seemingly precisely those that are inherent in self-oscillatory\nsystems. First, the term \u201cself-excitation\u201d should be replaced by \u201closs of stability\u201d. Further-\nmore, the hysteresis of turbulence, its \u201cappearance or disappearance as the flow velocity\nincreases or decreases\u201d can be explained in terms of the specific character of the non-\nlinearity of the gain factor. Finally, the \u201cparamount importance of nonlinearity for its\nfully developed (stationary) turbulent state\u201d is quite possible in amplifiers too, because\nnonlinearity of the amplifier can have considerable influence on its output power spectrum.\nOne piece of evidence suggesting that turbulence is not a self-oscillatory process comes\nfrom the numerical experiments of Nikitin [80,81]. He simulated fluid flow in a circular\n3 This fact was first mentioned by Artamonov [79].\n4 In essence, this is exactly what occurs in the process of numerical simulation with periodic\nboundary conditions.\n7\npipe of a finite length and radius R with a given velocity at the input cross-section, and\nwith so-called \u2018soft\u2019 boundary conditions at the output cross-section; these latter are\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n=\n\u22022\u03be\n\u2202x2\n=\n\u22022\u03b7\n\u2202x2\n= 0, (2.1)\nwhere u is the longitudinal velocity component, \u03be and \u03b7 are the radial and angular com-\nponents of vorticity \u2126 = rot u, u = {u, v, w} is the flow velocity vector in cylindrical\ncoordinates x, r and \u03b8. Under these conditions a reflected wave apparently does not ap-\npear, or is very weak.\nAt the input cross-section of the pipe the longitudinal velocity component was taken to\nbe in the form of the Poiseuille profile u0(1 \u2212 r2\/R2), weakly disturbed by a harmonic\nforce at the frequency \u03c9 = 0.36u0\/R, i.e.,\nu = u0\n(\n1\u2212 r\n2\nR2\n)\n+ ARe\n(\nu\u2032(r)e\u2212i\u03c9t\n)\ncos \u03b8,\n(2.2)\nv = ARe\n(\nv\u2032(r)e\u2212i\u03c9t\n)\ncos \u03b8, w = ARe\n(\nw\u2032(r)e\u2212i\u03c9t\n)\nsin \u03b8,\nwhere u\u2032(r), v\u2032(r) and w\u2032(r) are the components of the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld vector-eigenfunction\nat frequency \u03c9, R is the pipe radius, and A is the disturbance amplitude. The velocity\nu0 and the pipe radius R were set such that the Reynolds number Re was equal to 4000.\nAs the amplitude A exceeded a certain critical value (A \u2265 Acr), random high-frequency\npulsations appeared in the flow after a short time interval. They occupied all the lower\npart of the pipe from x = x0, where x0 depended only weakly on the distance r from the\npipe axis. It turned out that the value of x0 decreased as A became larger. The appear-\nance of turbulent pulsations was accompanied by corresponding deformation of the profile\nof the longitudinal constituent of the mean velocity: at the pipe axis the mean velocity\ndecreased, whereas near the pipe wall it increased. We note that a similar deformation of\nthe mean velocity profile with increasing turbulent pulsations occurs in jet flows as well.\nThe instantaneous distributions of the longitudinal velocity component in a steady regime\nfor A\/u0 = 0.04 are shown in Fig. 1 [81].\n8\nAs the amplitude A gradually decreased, the turbulent region drifted progressively down-\nstream and disappeared at a certain value of A. It is known [82,8] that Poiseuille flow in a\ncircular pipe, in contrast to that in a plane channel, possesses the property that laminar\nflow is stable with respect to small perturbations for any Reynolds number. However, in\nthe case of sufficiently large Reynolds numbers, such a flow is unstable with respect to fi-\nnite perturbations. If an attractor existed corresponding to the turbulent mode, and if the\nrole of the harmonic disturbance was to lead phase trajectories into the attractor basin,\nthen turbulence should not disappear following cessation of the harmonic disturbance.\nIt may be inferred from Fig. 1 that the development of turbulence for A \u2265 Acr is associated\nwith a peculiar phase transition at the point x = x0 induced by an amplification of the\nnoise that is always present in any numerical experiment owing to rounding errors. The\nharmonic disturbance plays a dual role. First, it causes the appearance of instability and,\nsecondly, it initiates the phase transition, much as occurs in a pendulum with a randomly\nvibrated suspension axis [58], or in jets under low-frequency acoustic forcing [4]. It is no\naccident that the transition to turbulence was observed by Nikitin only for low-frequency\ndisturbances (for Strouhal numbers of order 0.1).\nPossible counter-arguments against the above ideas lie in the fact that numerical simula-\ntion results obtained with periodic boundary conditions are very close to those observed\nexperimentally. But the data obtained by Nikitin in the numerical experiment described\nabove are also close to numerical data for periodic boundary conditions [80]. The visual\nsimilarity of turbulent pulsations calculated for periodic conditions, and for the boundary\nconditions (2.1), (2.2), is illustrated in Fig. 2 [45]. This similarity may be explained by\nthe fact that many nonlinear oscillatory systems possess such pronounced intrinsic prop-\nerties that they exhibit these properties independently of the means of excitation. Some\nexamples of such (non-hydrodynamic) systems are described in [83].\nNote that our discussion is not related to so called closed flows, e.g. to the Couette\nflow between two rotating cylinders or spheres (see [44]). In closed flows there is always\nfeedback linking the output of the amplifier to its input, so that they consequently become\nself-oscillatory.\n9\n3 Some experimental results concerning turbulence development in jets\n3.1 The main properties of jet flows\nIssuing from a nozzle, a fluid jet always noticeably diverges. This is associated with the fact\nthat, owing to viscosity, neighboring fluid layers are increasingly drawn into the motion.\nThis phenomenon has come to be known as entrainment. The profile of the flow velocity\nchanges essentially in the process. At the nozzle exit, it is nearly rectangular, whereas\naway from the nozzle it becomes bell-shaped: see Fig. 3 a. The fluid layer within which\nthe mean velocity changes significantly is called the shear layer or the mixing layer (see,\nfor example, [84,86,87]). It can be seen from Fig. 3 a that, within the initial part of the\njet (x \u2264 xin), the thickness of the mixing layer increases with increasing distance from the\nnozzle. At x = xin the thickness of the internal part of the mixing layer \u03b41 becomes equal\nto the half-width of the nozzle outlet for a plane jet, or the nozzle radius for a circular jet,\nwhereupon a continuous boundary layer is formed. In the vicinity of the jet axis, the mean\nvelocity first decreases very slowly with increasing distance x from the nozzle. This part\nof the jet is called the initial part: see I in Fig. 3 b. Further on, the decrease of the mean\nvelocity becomes significant. This part of the jet is called the main part: see III in Fig. 3 b.\nParts I and III are separated by the so-called transient part II. The length of the initial\npart decreases with increasing intensity of disturbances at the nozzle exit section. This\ncan be seen in Fig. 4, where experimental dependences of the relative mean velocity U\/U0\non the relative distance x\/D from nozzle are plotted (D is the nozzle diameter). Results\nare shown for three values of the intensity of the disturbances at the nozzle exit section\n\u01ebu(0) =\n\u221a\nu(0)2 \u2212 U(0)2\/U0, where U0 and u(0) are the mean velocity and longitudinal\ncomponent of total flow velocity at the center of nozzle exit section, respectively [4,21].\nThe main parts of plane and axially symmetric jets possess approximately the property of\nself-similarity, i.e. at all jet cross-sections the velocity profiles are affine-similar [14]. For\na plane jet the property of self-similarity means that the jet velocity can be presented in\nthe form u(x, y) = x\u2212\u03b1F (y\/x\u03b2), where x and y are longitudinal and transverse coordinate\nrespectively, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are certain numbers and F is a function of y\/x\u03b2. The processes in\nthe jet main part are studied in considerable detail (see, e.g. [85\u201393]). We will consider\n10\nonly the processes in the initial part of a jet.\nIt is interesting that coherent structures are formed just in the mixing layer of initial part\nof the jet . They are vortex formations (bunches of vorticity). Their sizes are of the order\nof the thickness of the shear layer, and they are moderately long-lived. The presence of\ncoherent structures in a jet shear layer results in the intermittent behavior of a jet flow,\nespecially in the neighborhood of the external boundary of a jet, where turbulent and\nlaminar phases alternate [94].\n3.2 Evolution of power spectra of the pulsations of fluid velocity and pressure with the\ndistance from the nozzle exit section\nThe randomness of the hydrodynamic waves excited in a jet manifests itself, in particular,\nas continuous power spectra of the pulsations of fluid velocity and pressure. Within the\ninitial part of the jet, these spectra are of a resonant character. Experiments show that\nthe frequency fm corresponding to the maximum of the power spectrum within the initial\npart of the jet decreases as the distance from the nozzle exit increases [95\u201397,50]. Within\nthe main part of the jet, the power spectra decrease monotonically with frequency. Fig. 5\nshows examples of how the power spectra of the velocity pulsations evolve with distance\nfrom the nozzle exit, along the jet axis, and along a line offset by R from the axis [50].\nThe abscissa in each case plots the frequency expressed in terms of the Strouhal numbers\nSt = fD\/U0.\nAs mentioned above, most studies of the different processes in jets attribute such behavior\nof the pulsation power spectrum within the mixing layer to a pairing of vortices. When\npairing takes place, the vortex repetition rate must be halved. Within the initial part\nof the jet, depending on the conditions of outflow, from 3 to 4 pairings of vortices are\nusually observed [61]. The frequency fm at the end of the jet\u2019s initial part should therefore\ndecrease by factor of between 8 and 16, a conclusion that conflicts with experimental data.\nExperiments show that the frequency fm is not a step, but a smooth function of distance\nfrom the nozzle exit (see Fig. 6, where the experimental dependences of the Strouhal\nnumber Stm on the relative distance from the jet nozzle exit x\/D are plotted [45]). In\n11\nan attempt to resolve this conflict, the researchers holding this viewpoint speculate that\nthere is a statistical spread in the sites of pairing, but without explaining why there should\nbe such a spread.\nThe faster decrease of Stm within the mixing layer, compared to what happens on the\njet axis, may result from the influence of nonlinear feedback caused by acoustic waves\ninduced by vortices within the jet mixing layer. The presence of such waves is indirectly\nsupported by the experimental data of Laufer [61]. According to these data high-frequency\npulsations of fluid velocity within a mixing layer near the nozzle exit are modulated by\nlow-frequency pulsations with frequencies corresponding to Strouhal numbers St from 0.3\nto 0.5. This fact can be also illustrated by the power spectrum of velocity pulsations on\na line offset by R from the jet axis for x\/D = 0.5 (see Fig. 5, at the bottom). We see\nthat the spectrum peaks at the main frequency corresponding to the Strouhal number\nSt = 3.2 and the two side frequencies corresponding to St1 = 2.7 and St2 = 3.7. This\nmeans that the modulation frequency corresponds to the Strouhal number 0.5. Owing to\nthe nonlinear feedback, each jet cross-section can be considered as an oscillator with a\nnatural frequency depending on the distance from that cross-section to the nozzle exit. It\nis evident that the strongest pulsations at the cross-section at coordinate x have to occur\nat a frequency fm that is related to x by the resonant relation\nxfm\nUv\n+\nxfm\na\n= N,\nwhere Uv is the velocity of the vortex motion\n5 , a is the sound velocity, and N is an\ninteger. From this it follows at once that fm \u223c x\u22121. This is precisely the dependence\nwhich was found experimentally by Petersen [96] (Fig. 6 a). Outside the boundary layer\nwhere, within the initial part, inhomogeneities are very weak and nonlinear feedback is\nnearly absent, the decrease of fm with increasing x follows from the linear theory and is\nexplained by the jet\u2019s divergence as is shown below.\n5 It follows from visual observations and measurements of spatio-temporal correlations that\nUv \u2248 0.5 \u2013 0.7U0.\n12\n3.3 A jet as an amplifier of acoustic disturbances\nOwing to its strong instability, a fluid jet acts as an amplifier of disturbances whose fre-\nquencies lie within a certain range. It is an amplifier with a high spatial gain factor. A\nsmall acoustic disturbance at some frequency fa within this range near the nozzle trans-\nforms into a growing hydrodynamic wave. There is evidence for this in the experimental\nresults of Crow and Champagne [98] and Chan [99]. It follows from the experimental data\nin Fig. 7 [98] that, above a certain value of the acoustic wave amplitude, the dependence of\nthe relative root-mean-square pulsation of the longitudinal component of hydrodynamic\nvelocity \u01ebu =\n\u221a\nu2\/U0 acquires a resonant character. Here u is the deviation of the lon-\ngitudinal component of hydrodynamic velocity from its mean value at the acoustic wave\nfrequency fa, measured in terms of Strouhal numbers. The latter authors consider that the\nresonance is caused by a combination of linear amplification and nonlinear saturation. The\nlatter increases as the frequency of the disturbance rises. For \u01ebua =\n\u221a\nu2a\/U0 = 0.02, where\nua is the oscillatory velocity in the acoustic wave, the dependence of \u01ebu on Sta = faD\/U0\nis shown in Fig. 8. We see that \u01ebu is maximal for Sta \u2248 0.3.\nFigure 9 a taken from [99] shows that the gain factor depends nonmonotonically on\ndistance from the nozzle exit: it has a maximum at x\/D = (0.75\u00f71.25)\/Sta. A theoretical\ndependence similar to that shown in Fig. 9 a was found by Plaschko [100] by approximate\nsolution of the linearized Euler equations for a slowly diverging jet. It is depicted in\nFig. 9 b. By doing so, Plaschko showed that the decrease of the gain factor away from the\nnozzle exit is caused by jet divergence, and not by nonlinear effects as was claimed by a\nnumber of researchers.\n3.4 Suppression and intensification of turbulence in jets by a weak periodic forcing\nAn interesting consequence of the nonlinear effects in a jet is the possibility they provide\nfor controlling the turbulence level and the length of the jet\u2019s initial part by application of\na weak acoustic wave, or by vibration of the nozzle, at an appropriate frequency [101,4]. In\nthe case of high-frequency forcing, the hydrodynamic pulsations are suppressed, whereas\n13\nat low frequencies, vice versa, there is intensification of pulsations and turbulence. The\nexperiments show that marked intensification or suppression of turbulence within the\ninitial part of a jet, induced by a periodic forcing, is accompanied by changes in the\naerodynamic, thermal, diffusive and acoustic properties of the jet. All of these phenomena\nhave been observed by different researchers.\nIt should be noted that the influence of acoustic forcing was first studied by Ginevsky\nand Vlasov [102\u2013106]. Let us consider their main results.\nIn the case of a low-frequency harmonic acoustic forcing at a frequency f corresponding\nto a Strouhal number in the range 0.2\u2013to 0.6, the vortices in the jet\u2019s mixing layer are\nenlarged within the initial part. In turn, this results in an intensification of the turbulent\nintermixing, thickening the mixing layer, shortening of the initial part and an increase\nin entrainment; at the same time, the longitudinal and radial velocity pulsations at the\njet axis rise steeply. These effects are observed independently of the direction of the jet\nirradiation, provided that the amplitudes of the longitudinal and radial components of\noscillatory velocity in the sound wave at the jet axis near the nozzle lie in the range\n0.05\u20132% of U0. For the effects to occur, the amplitude of the acoustic wave must exceed\na certain threshold value. As the wave amplitude rises above this threshold, turbulent\nintermixing at first intensifies and the saturates. A further increase of the wave amplitude\nhas little or no effect on the jet.\nFor high-frequency acoustic forcing of the jet at a frequency corresponding to a Strouhal\nnumbers in the range 1.5\u20135.0, the vortices in the jet mixing layer become smaller. This\nresults in an attenuation of the turbulent intermixing, a reduction in the thickness of the\nmixing layer, a lengthening of the initial part, and a decrease of entrainment. Correspond-\ningly, the longitudinal and radial velocity pulsations on the jet axis decrease. In contrast\nto the effect of low-frequency forcing, high-frequency forcing does not lead to saturation\nwith increasing amplitude; moreover, an increase in the amplitude beyond a certain value\ncauses, not suppression of the turbulence, but its intensification (see Fig. 10 [65,107]).\nThese effects are observed universally for jets over a wide range of Reynolds numbers\n(Re = 102\u2013106), both for initially laminar and for turbulent boundary layers with a level\nof initial turbulence less than 10%.\n14\nThe foregoing can be illustrated by the experimental dependences of the flow relative\nmean velocity, and the relative root-mean-square pulsation of the longitudinal (\u01ebu) and\nradial \u01ebv components of hydrodynamic velocity on the distance from the nozzle exit along\nthe jet axis for fixed values of the Strouhal number (Fig. 11). All the dependences shown\ncorrespond to a fixed value of the acoustic forcing intensity. We see that the mean velocity\ndecreases essentially in the case of low-frequency forcing (0.2 < Sta < 1.5) and increases\nin the case of high-frequency forcing (Sta > 1.5). It should be noted that, as the acoustic\nforcing intensity at low-frequency increases, the initial part of the jet decreases in length\nright down to the point where it disappears [108].\nEffects similar to those described above are also observed for other means of periodic\nforcing of the jet: e.g. longitudinal or radial vibration of the nozzle, or a pulsating rate of\nfluid outflow from the nozzle [65,4].\nDetailed experimental and numerical studies of turbulence suppression in jet flows were\nalso performed by Hussain and collaborators [109\u2013112]. We concentrate in particular on\na single result of these works: that the suppression of turbulence by acoustic forcing of\nconstant amplitude depends on its frequency nonmonotonically: it is maximal at a value\nof the forcing frequency that depends on the amplitude (see Fig. 12 taken from [112]) 6 .\nPeriodic forcing of a jet changes markedly the form of its power spectra. For low-frequency\nforcing, the power spectra of the velocity pulsations near the nozzle contain discrete\nconstituents at the forcing frequency and its higher harmonics. An example of such a\nspectrum is given in Fig. 13. In the case of high-frequency forcing (see Fig. 14), the power\nspectra of the velocity pulsations within the jet mixing layer in the immediate vicinity of\nthe nozzle exit also contain discrete components at the forcing frequency and its higher\nharmonics. At a short distance from the nozzle the second subharmonic appears in the\nspectrum. Next the fourth, eighth and successively higher subharmonics appear in the\nspectra. At sufficiently large distances from the nozzle exit the spectra are decreasing\nalmost monotonically.\n6 We note that authors of [112] used, not the conventional Strouhal number St, but St\u03b8 = St\u03b8\/D,\nwhere \u03b8 is the so-called boundary layer momentum thickness at the nozzle exit (see [14]).\n15\nKibens [113] obtained the dependences on distance from the nozzle of the Strouhal number\ncorresponding to the spectral line of highest intensity, both along the jet axis and along a\nline offset from the axis by R, for high-frequency acoustic forcing with a Strouhal number\nof 3.54 (Fig. 15 [113,45]). We see that these dependences are step-like, with distinct\nhysteresis phenomena. Adherents to the viewpoint that the decrease of Stm with distance\nfrom the nozzle for a free jet is caused by vortex pairing attribute the step-like character\nof the dependences to localization of the sites of pairing caused by the acoustic forcing\n[65,4]. In this explanation, the causes of the localization are ignored and the hysteresis\nphenomena are not discussed. The picture presented in Fig. 15 can also be interpreted\nas the successive occurrence of subharmonic resonances of higher and higher order as\nx increases. The transition from subharmonic resonance of one order to the next can\nclearly be accompanied by hysteresis, if within a certain range of x both of the resonances\nare stable. In the transition to a subharmonic resonance of higher order, the frequency\nhas to be halved. This can manifest itself as vortex pairing. We can thus infer that the\nexperimentally observed localization of the sites of vortex pairing, when an acoustic wave\nacts upon a jet, is a consequence, but not a cause, of the indicated behavior of the power\nspectra.\n4 The analogy between noise-induced oscillations of a pendulum with ran-\ndomly vibrated suspension axis and turbulent processes in a jet\nIt seems at first sight very surprising that there should exist any analogy between the\ndevelopment and control of turbulence in a jet, and the noise-induced oscillations of a\npendulum with a randomly vibrated suspension axis. These latter oscillations and their\ncontrol were first studied in [114,115,58,116,117,51]. We believe that the analogy arises\nbecause the onset of turbulence in jets is a noise-induced phase transition, and the pen-\ndulum with a randomly vibrated suspension axis is an appropriate model for illustrating\njust such a transition [48].\nIn the simplest case, when additive noise is neglected, the equation describing the oscil-\n16\nlations of a pendulum with a randomly vibrated suspension axis is:\n\u03d5\u00a8+ 2\u03b2\n(\n1 + \u03b1\u03d5\u02d92\n)\n\u03d5\u02d9+ \u03c920 (1 + \u03be(t)) sin\u03d5 = 0, (4.1)\nwhere \u03d5 is the pendulum\u2019s angular deviation from the equilibrium position, 2\u03b2 (1 + \u03b1\u03d5\u02d92) \u03d5\u02d9\nis proportional to the moment of the friction force which is assumed to be nonlinear, \u03c90 is\nthe natural frequency of small oscillations, and \u03be(t) is a comparatively wide-band random\nprocess with nonzero power spectral density at the frequency 2\u03c90.\nWhen the intensity of the suspension axis vibration 7 exceeds a certain critical value\nproportional to the friction factor \u03b2, excitation of pendulum oscillations occurs, and the\nvariance of the pendulum\u2019s angular deviation becomes nonzero. The evolution of such\noscillations, and their power spectra with increasing noise intensity, found by the numerical\nsimulation of Eq. (4.1), are shown in Fig. 16. It can be seen from the figure that, close to\nthe excitation threshold, the pendulum oscillations possess the property of so called on\u2013\noff\u2013intermittency. This notion was first introduced by Platt et al. [118], although a similar\nphenomenon was considered earlier in [119]. It was noted in [118] that intermittency of\nthis kind is similar to the intermittency in turbulent flows. It is of importance that on-\noff intermittency is possible, not only in dynamical systems, but in stochastic ones as\nwell [120]. It results from fluctuational transitions through the boundary of excitation\n[121,123]. External manifestations of on-off intermittency are similar to those of ordinary\nintermittency (see e.g. [124]), i.e. over prolonged periods the pendulum oscillates in the\nimmediate vicinity of its equilibrium position (\u2018laminar phases\u2019); these slight oscillations\nalternate with short random bursts of larger amplitude (\u2018turbulent phases\u2019). Away from\nthe excitation threshold the duration of the laminar phases decreases and that of the\nturbulent ones increases, with the laminar phases ultimately disappearing altogether [121].\nThe variance of the pendulum\u2019s angular deviation increases in the process. Comparing\nthe evolution of the power spectra shown in Figs. 5 and 16, we can see that they have\nmuch in common.\nAs described in [122], high-pass filtering of turbulent velocity pulsations reveals their\n7 By intensity of the suspension axis vibration is meant the spectral density of \u03be(t) at frequency\n2\u03c90 (\u03ba(2\u03c90)).\n17\nintermittent behavior. We have studied this phenomenon both for experimental velocity\npulsations in a jet measured by one of us [50] and also for the pendulum oscillations\nconsidered above. In each case we have observed on-off intermittency after high-pass\nfiltering. This fact can be considered as an additional argument in support of the parallels\nbetween noise-induced pendulum oscillations and turbulent processes in jets.\nIt is important to note that the response of the pendulum to a small additional harmonic\nforce (additional vibration of the suspension axis) is similar to the response of a jet to\nan acoustic force. For example, in the case when the intensity of the random suspension\naxis vibration is close to its threshold value, the dependence of the intensity of pendulum\noscillations on the frequency of the additional harmonic forcing is of a resonant character,\nvery much like a jet subject to an acoustic force (compare Figs. 17 and 8).\nJust as in the case of turbulent jets, the noise-induced pendulum oscillations under con-\nsideration can be controlled by a small additional harmonic force. The inclusion of the\nadditional force can be effected by substitution into Eq. (4.1) of \u03be + a cos\u03c9at in place of\n\u03be, where a and \u03c9a are respectively the amplitude and frequency of the additional vibra-\ntion of the suspension axis. If the frequency of the additional forcing is relatively low,\nthen this forcing intensifies the pendulum oscillations and lowers the excitation threshold;\nvice versa, a relatively high-frequency forcing suppresses the pendulum oscillations and\nincreases the excitation threshold. The intensification of the pendulum oscillations by a\nlow-frequency additional vibration is illustrated in Fig. 18 for two values of the vibration\nfrequency. We see that the lower the forcing frequency is, the larger the variance of the\noscillation becomes. Just as for jets [125], when the forcing amplitude becomes relatively\nlarge, the pendulum\u2019s oscillation amplitude saturates.\nWe now consider in detail the possibility of suppressing noise-induced pendulum oscil-\nlations by the addition of a high-frequency vibration. Numerical simulation of Eq. (4.1)\nwith \u03be+a cos\u03c9at in place of \u03be, where \u03c9a > 2, shows that such suppression can occur. The\nresults of the simulation are presented in Figs. 19 and 20. It is evident from Fig. 20 that,\nfor small amplitudes of the high-frequency vibration, this vibration has little or no effect\non the noise-induced oscillations (see Fig. 19 a). As the amplitude increases, however,\nthe intensity of the noise-induced oscillations decreases rapidly and the duration of the\n18\n\u2018laminar\u2019 phases correspondingly increases (see Figs. 19 b, c, d, and e). When the ampli-\ntude exceeds a certain critical value (for \u03c9a = 19.757 it is equal to 42) the oscillations\nare suppressed entirely. As the amplitude increases further the oscillations reappear, but\nnow because the conditions required for parametric resonance come into play. For smaller\nfrequencies \u03c9a, the behavior of the pendulum oscillations is different. The dependences\nof the variance of the angle \u03d5 on a for a number of values of the vibration frequency are\nshown in Fig. 20. It is evident that the variance of \u03d5 at first decreases, passes through\na certain minimum value, and then increases again. It is important to note that this\nminimum value becomes smaller with increasing forcing frequency, but that it is attained\nfor larger forcing amplitudes at higher frequencies. For sufficiently high frequencies the\noscillations can be suppressed entirely (the case illustrated in Fig. 19). The dependence\nshown in Fig. 20 a closely resembles the corresponding dependence for a jet presented in\nFig. 10.\nThe dependences of \u03c3 on \u03c9a for a number of fixed amplitudes of the additional vibration\nare illustrated in Fig. 21. Again, these dependences closely resemble the corresponding\nones for a jet shown in Fig. 12.\nThe presence of a small additive noise, in addition to the multiplicative one in Eq. (4.1),\ndoes not change the behavior of the pendulum qualitatively, but there are large quan-\ntitative differences. The principal one is the impossibility of achieving full suppression\nof the pendulum oscillations. Nevertheless, a very marked attenuation of the oscillation\nintensity occurs. This is illustrated in Fig. 22. It should be emphasized that, in the case\nof turbulence, full suppression is of course also impossible.\n5 The main equations and dynamics of a plane jet\nLet us consider a plane jet issuing from a nozzle of width 2d. Neglecting compressibility, we\nmay describe the processes in such a jet by the two-dimensional Navier\u2013Stokes equation\nfor the stream function \u03a8(t, x, y) [11]:\n\u2202\u2206\u03a8\n\u2202t\n\u2212 \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u2206\u03a8\n\u2202y\n+\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202y\n\u2202\u2206\u03a8\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u03bd\u2206\u2206\u03a8 = 0, (5.1)\n19\nwhere \u2206 =\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n+\n\u22022\n\u2202y2\nis the Laplacian, \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity, x is the coordinate\nalong the jet axis, and y is the transverse coordinate. The stream function \u03a8(t, x, y) is\nrelated to the longitudinal (U) and transverse (V ) components of the flow velocity by\nU(t, x, y) =\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202y\n, V (t, x, y) = \u2212 \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202x\n. (5.2)\nWe can conveniently rewrite Eq. (5.1) in terms of the stream function \u03a8(t, x, y) and the\nvorticity \u2126\u02dc(t, x, y) which is defined by\n\u2126\u02dc(t, x, y) = \u2206\u03a8(t, x, y). (5.3)\nIn dimensionless coordinates x\u2032 = x\/d, y\u2032 = y\/d and time t\u2032 = U0t\/d, the equations for\nthe stream function and vorticity become:\n\u2126\u02dc\u2032(t\u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032) = \u2206\u2032\u03a8(t\u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032), (5.4)\n\u2202\u2126\u02dc\u2032(t\u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032)\n\u2202t\u2032\n\u2212 \u2202\u03a8\n\u2032(t\u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032)\n\u2202x\u2032\n\u2202\u2126\u02dc\u2032(t\u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032)\n\u2202y\u2032\n+\n\u2202\u03a8\u2032(t\u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032)\n\u2202y\u2032\n\u2202\u2126\u02dc\u2032(t\u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032)\n\u2202x\u2032\n\u2212 2\nRe\n\u2206\u2032\u2126\u02dc\u2032(t\u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032) = 0, (5.5)\nwhere \u2206\u2032 is the Laplacian in terms of x\u2032 and y\u2032, Re = 2U0d\/\u03bd is the Reynolds number,\nand U0 is the mean flow velocity in the nozzle center.\nFrom this point onwards the primes will be dropped. It should be noted that in so deciding\non a dimensionless time, the circular frequencies \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f are measured in units of S =\n\u03c9d\/U0 \u2261 \u03c0St, where St = 2fd\/U0 is the Strouhal number.\nIn accordance with the ideas presented above, the onset of turbulence is caused by random\ndisturbances (noise) in the nozzle exit section. The authors of most of the works devoted\nto the stability of these small disturbances [126\u2013128,132] split the solution into mean\nvalues and small random disturbances. In our opinion this procedure is inappropriate\nfor two reasons: first, exact equations for the mean values are unknown; and, secondly,\nthe random disturbances make a significant contribution to the mean values. Therefore\nwe split the solution of Eqs. (5.4), (5.5) into dynamical and stochastic constituents. The\ndynamical constituents are described by stationary Navier-Stokes equations and differ\n20\nfrom the mean values of the corresponding variables because, owing to the quadratic\nnonlinearity, the stochastic constituents also contribute to the mean values. Ignoring noise\nsources everywhere except in the nozzle exit (for x = 0) we set\nU(t, 0, y) = ud(0, y) + \u03be1(t, y), V (t, 0, y) = vd(0, y) + \u03be2(t, y), (5.6)\nwhere ud(0, y) and vd(0, y) are the dynamical constituents of the longitudinal and trans-\nverse velocity components, respectively, and \u03be1(t, y) and \u03be2(t, y) are random processes. It\nshould be noted that ud(0, y) and vd(0, y), as well as \u03be1(t, y) and \u03be2(t, y), are not indepen-\ndent, but are related by the continuity equation.\nWe consider first the dynamical constituents of the velocity and vorticity. It follows from\nEqs. (5.4), (5.5) that the dynamical constituents ud(x, y), vd(x, y)) and \u2126d(x, y) are de-\nscribed by the equations\n\u2126d(x, y) =\n\u2202ud(x, y)\n\u2202y\n\u2212 \u2202vd(x, y)\n\u2202x\n, (5.7)\n\u2202ud(x, y)\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202vd(x, y)\n\u2202y\n= 0, (5.8)\nud(x, y)\n\u2202\u2126d(x, y)\n\u2202x\n+ vd(x, y)\n\u2202\u2126d(x, y)\n\u2202y\n\u2212 2\nRe\n(\n\u22022\u2126d(x, y)\n\u2202x2\n+\n\u22022\u2126d(x, y)\n\u2202y2\n)\n= 0. (5.9)\nIt is very difficult, if not impossible, to solve these nonlinear equations exactly. Therefore\nwe choose ud(x, y) in the form of a given function of y with unknown parameters depending\non x. The shape of this function must depend on whether the outflow from the nozzle is\nlaminar or turbulent. For simplicity, we restrict our consideration to laminar nozzle flow.\nIn this case we can set ud(x, y) so that, at the nozzle exit section, the boundary layer is\nclose in form to that described by the Blasius equation (see [14,11])\nuBl(y) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nF (\u03b7) for |y| \u2264 1,\n0 for |y| \u2265 1,\n(5.10)\n21\nwhere\n\u03b7 =\na(1\u2212 |y|)\n\u03b400\n, (5.11)\n\u03b400 = 1\/(b0\n\u221a\nRe) is the relative thickness of the boundary layer at the nozzle exit, b0 is\ndetermined by the conditions of outflow from the nozzle, a is a parameter which depends\non the definition of the boundary layer thickness 8 , F (\u03b7) is the derivative with respect to\n\u03b7 of the Blasius function f(\u03b7), described by the equation\nd3f\nd\u03b73\n+\nf\n2\nd2f\nd\u03b72\n= 0 (5.12)\nwith initial conditions f(0) = 0, df(0)\/d\u03b7 = 0, d2f(0)\/d\u03b72 \u2248 0.332 [14,11].\nTaking account of the entrainment of the ambient fluid, we set the velocity profile close\nto (5.10) for x = 0 to the form\nud(x, y) =\n1\n1 + tanh(q\/\u03b400 + r0)\n[\n1\u2212 tanh\n(\nq\n|y| \u2212 1\n\u03b40(x)\n\u2212 r(x)\n)]\n, (5.13)\nwhere \u03b40(x) and r(x) are unknown functions of x, and \u03b40(x) is the boundary layer thickness\nwhich is equal to \u03b400 for x = 0, r0 = r(0). We note that the profile (5.13) was first suggested\nin [46]; it is similar to that given for the mean velocity in [126\u2013128,132].\nThe thicknesses of inner and external boundary layers (\u03b41(x) and \u03b42(x)) are defined by\nthe relations:\nud\n(\nx, 1\u2212 \u03b41(x)\n)\n= \u03b1, ud\n(\nx, 1 + \u03b42(x)\n)\n= 1\u2212 \u03b1, (5.14)\nwhere \u03b1 is a number close to 1.

(5.17)\nThe form of the velocity profile determines the so-called shape-factor H [14], which is\nequal to the ratio between the displacement thickness\n\u03b4\u2217(0) =\n1\n\u03b40(0)\n1+\u03b42(0)\u222b\n0\n(\n1\u2212 ud(0, y)\n)\ndy\nand the thickness of momentum loss\n\u03b8(0) =\n1\n\u03b40(0)\n1+\u03b42(0)\u222b\n0\nud(0, y)\n(\n1\u2212 ud(0, y)\n)\ndy.\nFor a turbulent boundary layer, the shape-factor H has to lie in the range 1.4\u20131.6 [14],\nwhereas for a laminar boundary layer it has to be significantly more. Using the values of\nparameters calculated above we can calculate \u03b4\u2217(0), \u03b8(0) and H(0) for our velocity profile.\nAs a result, we find \u03b4\u2217(0) \u2248 0.5081, \u03b8(0) \u2248 0.1588 and H(0) \u2248 3.2. Thus, our velocity\nprofile does correspond to a laminar boundary layer.\nTo find the unknown functions in the expression (5.13), we use the conservation laws for\nthe fluxes of momentum and energy. Usually they are derived for the mean values of these\nfluxes starting from the Reynolds equations [86,21], and therefore contain the so-called\nturbulent viscosity. We derive them directly starting from Eqs. (5.7)\u2013(5.9) for dynamical\nconstituents. For this we transform Eqs. (5.7)\u2013(5.9) in the following way. Substituting\n\u2126d(x, y) from Eq. (5.7) into Eq. (5.9), and taking into account that within the jet\u2019s initial\npart \u22022ud\/\u2202x\n2 and \u22022vd\/\u2202x\n2 are negligibly small, we obtain\nud(x, y)\n\u22022ud(x, y)\n\u2202x\u2202y\n+ vd(x, y)\n\u22022ud(x, y)\n\u2202y2\n\u2212 2\nRe\n\u22023ud(x, y)\n\u2202y3\n= 0. (5.18)\n23\nTaking account of the continuity equation (5.8) we can rewrite Eq. (5.18) as\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\u2202u2d(x, y)\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202\n(\nud(x, y)vd(x, y)\n)\n\u2202y\n\u2212 2\nRe\n\u22022ud(x, y)\n\u2202y2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 = 0. (5.19)\nBy integrating Eq. (5.19) over y, we obtain the following approximate equation:\n\u2202u2d(x, y)\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202\n(\nud(x, y)vd(x, y)\n)\n\u2202y\n\u2212 2\nRe\n\u22022ud(x, y)\n\u2202y2\n= 0. (5.20)\nThe conservation law for the dynamical constituent of the momentum flux is found by\nintegrating Eq.(5.20) over y from \u2212\u221e to\u221e, taking into account that ud(x,\u00b1\u221e) = 0 and\n\u2202ud(x,\u00b1\u221e)\/\u2202y = 0. We thus obtain\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nu2d(x, y) dy = 0. (5.21)\nTo derive the conservation law for the dynamical constituent of the energy flux, we mul-\ntiply Eq. (5.20) by 2ud(x, y) and transform it to the form\n\u2202u3d\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202(u2dvd)\n\u2202y\n=\n4\nRe\nud\n\u22022ud\n\u2202y2\n. (5.22)\nIntegrating further Eq. (5.22) over y from \u2212\u221e to\u221e and taking into account the boundary\nconditions indicated above we find\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nu3d(x, y) dy = \u2212\n4\nRe\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\n(\n\u2202ud(x, y)\n\u2202y\n)2\ndy. (5.23)\nBecause ud(x, y) is an even function of y, we obtain from (5.21) and (5.23) the following\napproximate equations:\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nu2d(x, y) dy =\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nu2d(0, y) dy, (5.24)\n3\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nu2d(x, y)\n\u2202ud(x, y)\n\u2202x\ndy = \u2212 4\nRe\n\u221e\u222b\n0\n(\n\u2202ud(x, y)\n\u2202y\n)2\ndy. (5.25)\n24\nSubstituting (5.13) into Eq. (5.24) and taking into account that\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nu2d(0, y) dy \u2248 1\nwe obtain a relationship between r(x) and \u03b40(x):\nln\n[\n2 cosh\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r(x)\n)]\n\u2212 q\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r(x)\u2212 1\n2\n[\n1 + tanh\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r(x)\n)]\n= 0. (5.26)\nWithin the jet part, where\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n\u226b 1, (5.27)\nthe relationship (5.26) reduces to 2r(x) \u2248 1, i.e. r(x) \u2248 r0 = 0.5. It follows from this and\n(5.19), (5.17) that\n\u03b41(x) \u2248 \u03b40(x)\n3\n, \u03b42(x) \u2248 2\u03b40(x)\n3\n. (5.28)\nSubstituting (5.13) into Eq. (5.25), and taking account of (5.26), we find the differential\nequation for \u03b40(x):\n{\n5 tanh\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n)\n\u2212 4\u2212 cosh\u22122\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n)\n\u2212 2q\n\u03b40(x)\n[\n1\u2212 tanh\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n)\n+\n1\n4\n(\n3 + tanh\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n))\ncosh\u22122\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n)]}\nd\u03b40(x)\ndx\n=\n4q2\n3Re\u03b40(x)\n[\n1 + tanh\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n)] [\n1 + tanh\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n)\n+ cosh\u22122\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n)]\n.\n(5.29)\nA solution of this equation can be found analytically only for the condition (5.27). In this\ncase Eq. (5.29) becomes\nd\u03b40(x)\ndx\n=\n16q2\n3Re\u03b40(x)\n. (5.30)\nIt follows from Eq. (5.30) that\n\u03b40(x) =\n\u221a\n\u03b4200 + 2kx ,\nd\u03b40(x)\ndx\n=\nk\n\u03b40(x)\n, (5.31)\n25\nwhere k = 16q2\/(3Re).\nWe note that the dependence \u03b40(x) found here from the Navier\u2013Stokes equations differs\nfrom that found from the Reynolds equations [86,21] and containing the turbulent viscosity\n\u03bdt. Since, by Prandtl\u2019s hypothesis [13], \u03bdt is proportional to the boundary layer thickness\n\u03b4(x), the dependence \u03b4(x) was found to be linear.\nThe expressions for vd(x, y) and \u2126d(x, y) can be found by exact solution of Eqs. (5.7),\n(5.8). As a result, we obtain\nvd(x, y) = \u2212 16qsign y\n3Re\u03b40(x)\n(\n1 + tanh(q\/\u03b400 + r0)\n)\n[\nq(|y| \u2212 1)\n\u03b40(x)\ntanh\n(\nq(|y| \u2212 1)\n\u03b40(x)\n\u2212 r0\n)\n\u2212 q\n\u03b40(x)\ntanh\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n)\n\u2212 ln\ncosh\n(\nq(|y| \u2212 1)\/\u03b40(x)\u2212 r0\n)\ncosh\n(\nq\/\u03b40(x) + r0\n)\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb , (5.32)\n\u2126d(x, y) = \u2212 qsign y\n\u03b40(x)\n(\n1 + tanh(q\/\u03b400 + r0)\n)\n{(\n1 +\n256q4(|y| \u2212 1)2\n9\u03b440(x)Re\n2\n)\ncosh\u22122\n(\nq(|y| \u2212 1)\n\u03b40(x)\n\u2212 r0\n)\n\u2212 256q\n2\n9\u03b420(x)Re\n2\n[\nq2\n\u03b420(x)\ncosh\u22122\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n)\n\u2212 q\n\u03b40(x)\n(\n(|y| \u2212 1) tanh\n(\nq(|y| \u2212 1)\n\u03b40(x)\n\u2212 r0\n)\n\u2212 tanh\n(\nq\n\u03b40(x)\n+ r0\n))\n+ ln\ncosh\n(\nq(|y| \u2212 1)\/\u03b40(x)\u2212 r0\n)\ncosh\n(\nq\/\u03b40(x) + r0\n)\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\n\uf8fe . (5.33)\nFor the condition (5.27), from (5.32)and (5.33) we find the following approximate asymp-\ntotic expressions for vd and \u2126d:\nvd(x,\u00b1\u221e) \u2248 \u2213 16qr0\n3\u03b40(x)Re\n, \u2126d(x,\u00b1\u221e) \u2248 \u2213 256q\n3r0\n9\u03b430(x)Re\n2 . (5.34)\nFig. 23 shows plots of ud(x, y), vd(x, y), \u2126d(x, y) versus y for b0 = 0.1, q = 3, r0 = 0.5,\nRe = 25000, x = 0 and x = 8. We see that for all values of y, except for narrow intervals\nnear y = \u00b11, ud(x, y), vd(x, y) and \u2126d(x, y) are nearly constant. The constant transverse\nvelocity component for |y| > 1 directed towards the jet axis accounts for the entrainment\nof ambient fluid with the jet flow.\n26\nIt should be emphasized that the results obtained here concern only the dynamical con-\nstituents of the velocity and vorticity. Stochastic constituents greatly influence the thick-\nness of the boundary layer, its dependence on the distance from the nozzle, and values of\nthe mean velocities (see below).\nSubstituting further\nU(t, x, y) = ud(x, y) +\n\u2202\u03c8(t, x, y)\n\u2202y\n, V (t, x, y) = vd(x, y)\u2212 \u2202\u03c8(t, x, y)\n\u2202x\n,\n(5.35)\n\u2126\u02dc(t, x, y) = \u2126d(x, y) + \u2126(t, x, y)\ninto Eqs. (5.4), (5.5) and taking into account (5.7)\u2013(5.9), we find the equations for the\nstochastic constituents \u03c8(t, x, y) and \u2126(t, x, y), which we write in the form\n\u2126\u2212\u2206\u03c8 = 0, (5.36)\n\u2202\u2126\n\u2202t\n+ ud(x, y)\n\u2202\u2126\n\u2202x\n+ vd(x, y)\n\u2202\u2126\n\u2202y\n\u2212 \u2126dy(x, y) \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202x\n+ \u2126dx(x, y)\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202y\n\u2212 2\nRe\n\u2206\u2126\n=\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u2126\n\u2202y\n\u2212 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202y\n\u2202\u2126\n\u2202x\n, (5.37)\nwhere\n\u2126dx(x, y) =\n\u2202\u2126d(x, y)\n\u2202x\n, \u2126dy(x, y) =\n\u2202\u2126d(x, y)\n\u2202y\n.\nAccording to (5.6) the boundary conditions for Eqs.

(5.38)\n6 The derivation of truncated equations for the amplitude of stochastic con-\nstituents\nTo describe the development of turbulence, we can assume that the right-hand side of\nEq. (5.37) is of the order of a small parameter \u01eb. In this case Eqs. (5.36), (5.37) can be\nsolved approximately by a method similar to the Krylov\u2013Bogolyubov method for spatially\nextended systems [131]. We therefore seek a solution in the form of a series in \u01eb:\n27\n\u2126(t, x, y) = \u21260(t, x, y) + \u01ebr1(t, x, y) + \u01eb\n2r2(t, x, y) + . . . ,\n\u03c8(t, x, y) = \u03c80(t, x, y) + \u01ebs1(t, x, y) + \u01eb\n2s2(t, x, y) + . . . , (6.1)\nu(t, x, y) =\n\u2202\u03c8(t, x, y)\n\u2202y\n= u0(t, x, y) + \u01ebq1(t, x, y) + \u01eb\n2q2(t, x, y) + . . . ,\nwhere \u21260(t, x, y) and \u03c80(t, x, y) are generative solutions of Eqs. (5.36), (5.37), u0(t, x, y) =\n\u2202\u03c80(t, x, y)\/\u2202y; r1(t, x, y), r2(t, x, y), . . ., s1(t, x, y), s2(t, x, y), . . . are unknown functions,\nand q1(t, x, y) = \u2202s1(t, x, y)\/\u2202y, q2(t, x, y) = \u2202s2(t, x, y)\/\u2202y, . . ..\nIt should be emphasized that because of the quadratic nonlinearity the contribution of\nnonlinear terms into turbulent processes can be estimated only by using the second ap-\nproximation of the Krylov\u2013Bogolyubov method. Thus in the expansion (6.1) we have to\nretain the terms up to the second order with respect to \u01eb.\n6.1 Generative solutions\nPutting the right-hand side of Eq. (5.37) to zero and eliminating the stochastic constituent\nof vorticity, we obtain the generative equation for the stochastic constituent of the stream\nfunction:\n\u2202\u2206\u03c80\n\u2202t\n+ ud(x, y)\n\u2202\u2206\u03c80\n\u2202x\n+ vd(x, y)\n\u2202\u2206\u03c80\n\u2202y\n\u2212\u2126dy(x, y) \u2202\u03c80\n\u2202x\n+ \u2126dx(x, y)\n\u2202\u03c80\n\u2202y\n\u2212 2\nRe\n\u2206\u2206\u03c80 = 0. (6.2)\nIt should be noted that finding the generative solution is similar to the well known problem\nof the linear instability of a jet flow. During the last three decades, this problem was\nstudied primarily by Crighton and Gaster [126,132], Michalke [128] and Plaschko [127]. In\nthese works a profile of the mean flow velocity for a circular jet was given, and the problem\nwas solved approximately, mainly within the framework of linearized Euler equations.\nBecause the coefficients of these equations depend on the coordinates, an exact analytic\nsolution could not be found. Numerical calculations performed by these authors are in\nqualitative agreement with experimental data.\nHere we find the generative solution for a plane jet based on the linearized Navier\u2013Stokes\n28\nequation (6.2) and using the dynamical constituents of velocity and vorticity calculated\nabove. We emphasize that viscosity should be taken into account, because all terms in\nEq. (6.2) are of the same order over the region of the boundary layer. We chose a plane jet,\nrather than a circular one, by virtue of the same reasoning as in [92]: its simple geometry\nand boundary conditions.\nWe seek a partial solution of Eq. (6.2) in the form of a sum of running waves of frequency\nS with a slowly varying complex wave number Q(S, x):\n\u03c80(t, x, y) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nf (S)(x, y) exp\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0i\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edSt\u2212\nx\u222b\n0\nQ(S, x) dx\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb dS. (6.3)\nTaking into account that the jet diverges slowly, we can represent the function f (S)(x, y)\nand the wave number Q(S, x) as series in a conditional small parameter \u00b5 \u223c 1\/\u221aRe:\nf (S)(x, y) = f0(S, x, y) + \u00b5f1(S, x, y) + . . . , Q(S, x) = Q0(S, x) + \u00b5Q1(S, x) + . . . , (6.4)\nwhere f0(S, x, y), f1(S, x, y), . . . are unknown functions vanishing, along with their deriva-\ntives, at y = \u00b1\u221e.\nSubstituting (6.3), in view of (6.4), into Eq. (6.2) and retaining only terms containing\nfirst derivatives with respect to x we obtain the following equations for f0(S, x, y) and\nf1(S, x, y):\nL0(Q0)f0 = 0, (6.5)\nL0(Q0)f1 = iQ1L1(Q0)f0 \u2212 L2(Q0)f0, (6.6)\nwhere\nL0(Q0) = i\n(\nS\u2212 ud(x, y)Q0\n) ( \u22022\n\u2202y2\n\u2212Q20\n)\n+ vd(x, y)\n(\n\u22023\n\u2202y3\n\u2212Q20\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n)\n+iQ0 \u2126dy(x, y) + \u2126dx(x, y)\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n\u2212 2\nRe\n(\n\u22024\n\u2202y4\n\u2212 2Q20\n\u22022\n\u2202y2\n+Q40\n)\n, (6.7)\nL1(Q0) = ud(x, y)\n(\n\u22022\n\u2202y2\n\u2212 3Q20\n)\n+ 2SQ0 \u2212 2iQ0vd(x, y) \u2202\n\u2202y\n\u2212\u2126dy(x, y) + 8iQ0\nRe\n(\n\u22022\n\u2202y2\n\u2212Q20\n)\n, (6.8)\n29\n30\nL2(Q0) = S\n(\n2Q0\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202Q0\n\u2202x\n)\n+ ud(x, y)\n[\n\u22023\n\u2202x\u2202y2\n\u2212 3Q0\n(\nQ0\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202Q0\n\u2202x\n)]\n\u2212 ivd(x, y)\n\u00d7\n(\n2Q0\n\u22022\n\u2202x\u2202y\n+\n\u2202Q0\n\u2202x\n\u2202\n\u2202y\n)\n\u2212 \u2126dy(x, y) \u2202\n\u2202x\n+\n4i\nRe\n[\n2Q0\n\u22023\n\u2202x\u2202y2\n+\n\u2202Q0\n\u2202x\n\u22022\n\u2202y2\n\u2212Q20\n(\n2Q0\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n+ 3\n\u2202Q0\n\u2202x\n)]\n. (6.9)\nEq. (6.5), with the boundary conditions for function f0 and its derivatives so as to be\nvanishing at y = \u00b1\u221e, describes a non-self-adjoint boundary-value problem, where Q0\nplays the role of an eigenvalue. Similar boundary-value problems, but on a finite interval,\nwere studied by Keldysh [129].

By varying\nQ0 until D(Q0) becomes equal to zero, we find the eigenvalues of Q0. The real part of\nthe eigenvalue of Q0 gives the real wave number K0, whereas its imaginary part gives\nthe wave gain factor \u03930. The dependences of the gain factor \u03930 and wave phase velocity\nvph0 = S\/K0 on the Strouhal number St are given for Re = 25000, b0 = 0.1 and a number\nvalues of x in Fig. 24 a and b.\nTo estimate the influence of the Reynolds number and the thickness of the boundary\nlayer at the nozzle exit, we have calculated the eigenvalues of Q0 for x = 0 in two cases:\nRe = 100000, b0 = 0.05 and Re = 100000, b0 = 0.02. In the first case the thickness of the\nboundary layer at the nozzle exit is the same as in Fig. 24, and in the second case it is\nconsiderably larger. The results are shown in Fig. 25. We see that, for the same thickness\nof boundary layer at the nozzle exit the results depend only weakly on the Reynolds\nnumber, whereas the thickness of the boundary layer affects the eigenvalues strongly.\nTo find the eigenfunction and the adjoint eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue\nQ0, we use Eq. (6.10) for the calculation of the correction Q1 to the eigenvalue Q0,\n36\nand we should in principle calculate the functions f01(S, x, y), f02(S, x, y), \u03c701(S, x, y)\nand \u03c702(S, x, y) and solve the systems of equations (6.23), taking into account that their\ndeterminants are equal to zero. However, in the process of a direct numerical solution of\nEqs. (6.5) and (6.11) over the region of boundary layer (region III) we face the problem of\nthe strong instability of solutions corresponding to the functions f01 and \u03c701 with respect\nto small rapidly increasing disturbances. This instability becomes more pronounced for\nlarger S.\nThe instability can be illustrated clearly if we pass in Eqs.

(6.32)\nIt is convenient to solve Eqs. (6.31) and (6.32) forward from y = y1(x) to y = 1 and\nbackward from y = y2(x) to y = 1, and then to sew the solutions found for y = 1. In the\n37\nfirst case we should find four partial solutions of these equations with initial conditions\nB1,2(S, x, y1) = B\u02dc1,2(S, x, y1) = \u00b1Q0, B3,4(S, x, y1) = B\u02dc3,4(S, x, y1) = \u00b1B12. (6.33)\nIt is evident that the functions f01(S, x, y), f02(S, x, y), \u03c701(S, x, y) and \u03c702(S, x, y), for\ny1 \u2264 |y| \u2264 1, are equal to\nf01(S, x, y) =\nA1\n2\n(\nexp\n(\n\u03c61(S, x, y)\n)\n\u2212 exp\n(\n\u03c62(S, x, y)\n))\n,\n(6.34)\nf02(S, x, y) =\nA2\n2\n(\nexp\n(\n\u03c63(S, x, y)\n)\n\u2212 exp\n(\n\u03c64(S, x, y)\n))\n,\n\u03c701(S, x, y) =\nA\u02dc1\n2\n(\nexp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc1(S, x, y)\n)\n\u2212 exp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc2(S, x, y)\n))\n,\n(6.35)\n\u03c702(S, x, y) =\nA\u02dc2\n2\n(\nexp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc3(S, x, y)\n)\n\u2212 exp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc4(S, x, y)\n))\n,\nwhere\n\u2202\u03c61,2(S, x, y)\n\u2202y\n= B1,2(S, x, y),\n\u2202\u03c6\u02dc1,2(S, x, y)\n\u2202y\n= B\u02dc1,2(S, x, y),\n\u2202\u03c63,4(S, x, y)\n\u2202y\n= B3,4(S, x, y),\n\u2202\u03c6\u02dc3,4(S, x, y)\n\u2202y\n= B\u02dc3,4(S, x, y), (y1 \u2264 |y| \u2264 1).\nIn the second case we should find two partial solutions of Eqs. (6.31) and (6.32) with\ninitial conditions\nB1(S, x, y2) = B21, B2(S, x, y2) = B22, B\u02dc1(S, x, y2) = B\u02dc21, B\u02dc2(S, x, y2) = B\u02dc22, (6.36)\nwhere B21, B22, B\u02dc21 and B\u02dc22 are defined by (6.22). The functions f01(S, x, y), f02(S, x, y),\n\u03c701(S, x, y) and \u03c702(S, x, y), for 1 \u2264 |y| \u2264 y2, are equal to\nf01(S, x, y) = C1 exp\n(\n\u03a61(S, x, y)\n)\n, f02(S, x, y) = C2 exp\n(\n\u03a62(S, x, y)\n)\n, (6.37)\n\u03c701(S, x, y) = C\u02dc1 exp\n(\n\u03a6\u02dc1(S, x, y)\n)\n, \u03c702(S, x, y) = C\u02dc2 exp\n(\n\u03a6\u02dc2(S, x, y)\n)\n, (6.38)\nwhere\n\u2202\u03a61,2(S, x, y)\n\u2202y\n= B1,2(S, x, y),\n\u2202\u03a6\u02dc1,2(S, x, y)\n\u2202y\n= B\u02dc1,2(S, x, y), (1 \u2264 |y| \u2264 y2).\n38\nNumerical solution of Eqs. (6.31) and (6.32), both forward and backward, has shown that\nin the first case all partial solutions for B tend to the third partial solution with initial\ncondition B|y=y1 = B12, whereas in the second case the first partial solution tends to\nthe second one with initial condition B|y=y2 = B22 (see, for example, Fig. 26, where all\nnumerical partial solutions of Eqs. (6.31) and (6.32) with initial conditions (6.33) and\n(6.36) are shown for S = 22). This means that all partial solutions, except the third one\nin the first case and the second one in the second case, are unstable. That is why we\nhave taken the two partial solutions of the equations for B and B\u02dc, following from the\nEuler equations, as the first and second approximate partial solutions of Eqs. (6.31) and\n(6.32), and, for y1 \u2264 y \u2264 1, ignored the fourth partial solution with a large negative real\npart. The former is valid because |Q0| \u223c |B21| \u226a\n\u221a\nRe, and the latter is valid because,\nfor y1 \u2264 y \u2264 1, exp (\n\u222b\nB3(S, x, y) dy)\u226b exp (\n\u222b\nB4(S, x, y) dy). The equations for B and B\u02dc\nfollowing from the Euler equations are\ni\n(\nS\u2212 ud(x, y)Q0\n)(\u2202B\n\u2202y\n+B2 \u2212Q20\n)\n+ iQ0\u2126dy(x, y) + \u2126dx(x, y)B = 0, (6.39)\ni\n(\nS\u2212 ud(x, y)Q0\n)(\u2202B\u02dc\n\u2202y\n+ B\u02dc2 \u2212Q20\n)\n\u2212 iQ0\n(\n2udy(x, y)B\u02dc + udyy(x, y)\n)\n+iQ0 \u2126dy(x, y)\u2212 \u2126dx(x, y) B\u02dc \u2212 \u2126dxy(x, y) = 0. (6.40)\nAn example of the partial solutions found in this way is given in Fig. 27 for S = 22.\nComparing Figs. 27 with 26 we see that, as distinct from the case shown in Fig. 26, all\nthe solutions found are stable.\nTo find the eigenfunctions and adjoint eigenfunctions we have to use expressions (6.34),\n(6.37) and, respectively, for the adjoint functions, (6.35), (6.38) and the sewing conditions\nfor y = 1. Thus we find the equations for A1, A2, C1 and C2 (and, correspondingly, in the\ncase of the adjoint eigenfunctions, for A\u02dc1, A\u02dc2, C\u02dc1 and C\u02dc2):\n39\nA1\n2\n(\nexp\n(\n\u03c61(S, x, 1)\n)\n\u2212 exp\n(\n\u03c62(S, x, 1)\n))\n+\nA2\n2\nexp\n(\n\u03c63(S, x, 1)\n)\n= C1 exp\n(\n\u03a61(S, x, 1)\n)\n+ C2 exp\n(\n\u03a62(S, x, 1)\n)\n,\nA1\n2\n(\nB\n(l)\n1 (S, x, 1) exp\n(\n\u03c61(S, x, 1)\n)\n\u2212 B(l)2 (S, x, 1) exp\n(\n\u03c62(S, x, 1)\n))\n+\nA2\n2\nB\n(l)\n3 (S, x, 1) exp\n(\n\u03c63(S, x, 1)\n)\n= C1B\n(r)\n1 (S, x, 1) exp\n(\n\u03a61(S, x, 1)\n)\n+ C2B21\n(r)(S, x, 1) exp\n(\n\u03a62(S, x, 1)\n)\n,\n(6.41)\nA1\n2\n((\nB\n(l)\n1 (S, x, 1)\n)2\nexp\n(\n\u03c61(S, x, 1)\n)\n\u2212\n(\nB\n(l)\n2 (S, x, 1)\n)2\nexp\n(\n\u03c62(S, x, 1)\n))\n+\nA2\n2\n(\nB\n(l)\n3 (S, x, 1)\n)2\nexp\n(\n\u03c63(S, x, 1)\n)\n= C1\n(\nB\n(r)\n1 (S, x, 1)\n)2\nexp\n(\n\u03a61(S, x, 1)\n)\n+ C2\n(\nB\n(r)\n2 (S, x, 1)\n)2\nexp\n(\n\u03a62(S, x, 1)\n)\n,\nA1\n2\n((\nB\n(l)\n1 (S, x, 1)\n)3\nexp\n(\n\u03c61(S, x, 1)\n)\n\u2212\n(\nB\n(l)\n2 (S, x, 1)\n)3\nexp\n(\n\u03c62(S, x, 1)\n))\n+\nA2\n2\n(\nB\n(l)\n3 (S, x, 1)\n)3\nexp\n(\n\u03c63(S, x, 1)\n)\n= C1\n(\nB\n(r)\n1 (S, x, 1)\n)3\nexp\n(\n\u03a61(S, x, 1)\n)\n+ C2\n(\nB\n(r)\n2 (S, x, 1)\n)3\nexp\n(\n\u03a62(S, x, 1)\n)\n,\nA\u02dc1\n2\n(\nexp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc1(S, x, 1)\n)\n\u2212 exp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc2(S, x, 1)\n))\n+\nA\u02dc2\n2\nexp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc3(S, x, y)\n)\n= C\u02dc1 exp\n(\n\u03a6\u02dc1(S, x, 1)\n)\n+ C\u02dc2 exp\n(\n\u03a6\u02dc2(S, x, 1)\n)\n,\nA\u02dc1\n2\n(\nB\u02dc\n(l)\n1 (S, x, 1) exp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc1(S, x, 1)\n)\n\u2212 B\u02dc(l)2 (S, x, 1) exp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc2(S, x, 1)\n))\n+\nA\u02dc2\n2\nB\u02dc\n(l)\n3 (S, x, 1) exp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc3(S, x, 1)\n)\n= C\u02dc1B\u02dc\n(r)\n1 (S, x, 1) exp\n(\n\u03a6\u02dc1(S, x, 1)\n)\n+ C\u02dc2B\u02dc21\n(r)(S, x, 1) exp\n(\n\u03a6\u02dc2(S, x, 1)\n)\n,\n(6.42)\nA\u02dc1\n2\n((\nB\u02dc\n(l)\n1 (S, x, 1)\n)2\nexp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc1(S, x, 1)\n)\n\u2212\n(\nB\u02dc\n(l)\n2 (S, x, 1)\n)2\nexp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc2(S, x, 1)\n))\n+\nA\u02dc2\n2\n(\nB\u02dc\n(l)\n3 (S, x, 1)\n)2\nexp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc3(S, x, 1)\n)\n= C\u02dc1\n(\nB\u02dc\n(r)\n1 (S, x, 1)\n)2\nexp\n(\n\u03a6\u02dc1(S, x, 1)\n)\n+ C\u02dc2\n(\nB\u02dc\n(r)\n2 (S, x, 1)\n)2\nexp\n(\n\u03a6\u02dc2(S, x, 1)\n)\n,\nA\u02dc1\n2\n((\nB\u02dc\n(l)\n1 (S, x, 1)\n)3\nexp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc1(S, x, 1)\n)\n\u2212\n(\nB\u02dc\n(l)\n2 (S, x, 1)\n)3\nexp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc2(S, x, 1)\n))\n+\nA\u02dc2\n2\n(\nB\u02dc\n(l)\n3 (S, x, 1)\n)3\nexp\n(\n\u03c6\u02dc3(S, x, 1)\n)\n= C\u02dc1\n(\nB\u02dc\n(r)\n1 (S, x, 1)\n)3\nexp\n(\n\u03a6\u02dc1(S, x, 1)\n)\n+ C\u02dc2\n(\nB\u02dc\n(r)\n2 (S, x, 1)\n)3\nexp\n(\n\u03a6\u02dc2(S, x, 1)\n)\n.\n40\nBecause the determinants of the systems of equations (6.41) and (6.42) are equal to\nzero, these equations allow us to find a = A2\/A1, c1 = C1\/A1 and c2 = C2\/A1 (and,\ncorrespondingly, a\u02dc = A\u02dc2\/A\u02dc1, c\u02dc1 = C\u02dc1\/A\u02dc1 and c\u02dc2 = C\u02dc2\/A\u02dc1). Examples of the eigenfunctions\nand adjoint eigenfunctions constructed in this way are illustrated in Figs. 28, 29 for x = 0,\n(a) S = 10 and (b) S = 18. We see that the range of the sharp change of the eigenfunctions\nand adjoint eigenfunctions becomes narrower with increasing S.\nIt is important that the first partial solution of Eq. (6.39) for y1 \u2264 y \u2264 1, B(l)1 (S, x, y),\ntransforms uninterruptedly into the first partial solution of the same equation for 1 \u2264\ny \u2264 y2, B(r)1 (S, x, y) (see Fig. 30). Thus, at a point 9 y = y\u2217(S, x) > 1 the real and\nimaginary parts of B1(S, x, y) change sign. This change of sign provides an explanation of\nthe formation of vortices within the boundary layer: on different sides of the pivot point\nthe stochastic constituents of the longitudinal velocity are oppositely directed.\nFor S < 3, the form of functions f02(S, x, y) and \u03c702(S, x, y) means that over the region of\nthe boundary layer (region III) the eigenfunctions f0(S, x, y) and adjoint eigenfunctions\n\u03c70(S, x, y) depend strongly on the Reynolds number and differ markedly from those found\nfrom the Euler equations. This is illustrated in Fig. 31, where these functions calculated\nby the way indicated above and from the Euler equations are compared for S = 1. For\nS > 8 the eigenfunctions and adjoint eigenfunctions are practically independent of the\nReynolds number, and hence may be calculated from the Euler equations.\nWith a knowledge of the eigenfunctions and adjoint eigenfunctions, we can use Eq. (6.10)\nto calculate the corrections Q1 to the eigenvalues of Q0. The values of \u0393 = \u03930+\u03931\/\u03bb and\nwave phase velocity vph = S\/(K0 +K1\/\u03bb) as functions of St are shown for different x in\nFig. 32 a and b. Comparing Fig. 32 a and 24 a we see that for x < 1 the corrections to the\neigenvalues of \u03930 are not small. This is caused by a rather large value of the derivative of\n\u03930 with respect to x for small x. The derivatives of \u03930 and vph0 for different values of x\nare shown in Fig. 33. As x increases the derivatives of \u03930 and vph0, and corrections to the\neigenvalues of Q0 become progressively smaller.\nIt can be seen that, as the distance from the nozzle increases, the gain factor decreases\n9 This point is called the pivot point.\n41\nfor large St and increases slightly for small St. For any given x the gain factor has a\nmaximum at St = Stm, where the greater x is the smaller Stm becomes. It is easily shown\nthat the shift of the gain factor maximum to the low-frequency region is caused by the\njet\u2019s divergence. Obviously, this shift of the gain factor maximum results in a shift of\nthe turbulent pulsation power spectrum towards the low-frequency region as the distance\nfrom the nozzle increases (see below). It is interesting that, from x \u2248 1, the dependence\nof Stm on x is of an exponential character.\nAnother important conclusion that can be drawn from Fig. 32 lies in the fact that the\nphase velocity of the hydrodynamic waves depends strongly on the Strouhal number, i.e.\nthese waves are rather significantly dispersive.\nNote also that the resonant character of the dependences of the gain factor on the Strouhal\nnumber that we have found indicates that each jet cross-section can be considered as an\noscillator whose natural frequency decreases with increasing distance from the nozzle.\nThis fact justifies consideration of a jet as a chain of coupled resonant amplifiers, which\nin turn allows us to understand the analogy between noise-induced pendulum oscillations\nand the turbulent processes in a jet.\nNeglecting the correction to the eigenfunction f0(S, x, y), we can write the generative\nsolutions \u03c80(t, x, y), u0(t, x, y) and \u21260(t, x, y) as\n\u03c80(t, x, y) \u2248 1\n2\u03c0\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nf0(S, x, y) exp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ediSt\u2212 i\nx\u222b\n0\nQ(S, x) dx\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 dS,\nu0(t, x, y) \u2248 1\n2\u03c0\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2202f0(S, x, y)\n\u2202y\nexp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ediSt\u2212 i\nx\u222b\n0\nQ(S, x) dx\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 dS, (6.43)\n\u21260(t, x, y) \u2248 1\n2\u03c0\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\n[\n\u22022f0(S, x, y)\n\u2202y2\n\u2212\n(\nQ2(S, x) + i\n\u2202Q0(S, x)\n\u2202x\n)\nf0(S, x, y)\n+iQ(S, x)\n\u2202f0(S, x, y)\n\u2202x\n]\nexp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ediSt\u2212 i\nx\u222b\n0\nQ(S, x) dx\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 dS.\nIt follows from (6.43) that the vorticity is moderately small outside the boundary layer.\nKnowing Q(S, x) and the expressions for u0(t, x, y) and f0(S, x, y) we can calculate the\nevolution of the velocity power spectra in the linear approximation. For the sake of sim-\n42\nplicity, we do so only for the region I. We can expand a random disturbance \u03be(t, y) of the\nlongitudinal component of velocity at the nozzle exit into a series in the eigenfunctions\nof our boundary value problem. Over region I we can approximate cosh\n(\nQ(S, 0)y\n)\nwith\neigenvalues of Q as the eigenfunctions for x = 0. Hence, we can set\n\u03be(t, y) = \u03be1(t) cosh\n(\nQ(S, 0)y\n)\n+ . . . . (6.44)\nThe spectral density \u3008A1(S)A1(S)\u3009 = \u3008A2(S)\u3009, where A(S) = |A1|(S), is determined by\nthe spectral density of \u03be1(t) which is denoted by us as \u03ba(S, 0). Because over region I\nu(S, 0, y) \u2248 A1(S)Q(S, x) cosh\n(\nQ(S, 0)y\n)\n. (6.45)\nwe find\n\u2329\nA2(S)\n\u232a\n=\n\u03ba(S, 0)\nK2(S, 0) + \u03932(S, 0)\n. (6.46)\nThere is almost no experimental information about \u03ba(S, 0), but there is one work [133]\ngiving power spectra of the longitudinal and transverse constituents of velocity pulsations\nover the range of the Strouhal numbers St 0\u20138 for a circular jet at different initial tur-\nbulence levels. It can be seen from these data that the form of the spectra depends only\nslightly on the initial turbulence level, that the spectra of the longitudinal and transverse\nconstituents of velocity pulsations are nearly identical, and that the spectral density de-\ncreases with increasing St. Since the dependence of the spectral densities presented in\n[133] on y is close to f(S)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223cosh(Q(S, 0)y)\u2223\u2223\u22232, where f(S) is a certain function of S, we can\nset \u03ba(S, 0) \u2248 f(S). So, in accordance with data presented in [133], we approximate \u03ba(S, 0)\nby the formula:\n\u03ba(S, 0) =\n\u03ba0\n1 + b1S+ b2S2 + b3S3\n, (6.47)\nwhere \u03ba0 characterizes the level of the disturbances at the nozzle exit, b1 = 0.152, b2 =\n\u22120.005 and b3 = 0.000002. The plot of \u03ba(S, 0)\/\u03ba0 described by (6.47) is shown in Fig. 34.\nComparison with experimental results for power spectra of velocity pulsations and for the\nmean longitudinal velocity shows that \u03ba0 should be taken as very small. Hereinafter we\n43\nwill set \u03ba0 = 8 \u00d7 10\u221228. It should be noted that, owing to the resonant character of the\ngain factor, the results are scarcely affected by the shape of the dependence of \u03ba(S, 0).\nIt follows from (6.43), (6.45) and (6.46) that the spectral density of the longitudinal\nvelocity pulsations in the linear approximation is\n\u03bal(S, x, y) = \u03ba(S, 0)\nK2(S, x) + \u03932(S, x)\nK2(S, 0) + \u03932(S, 0)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223cosh(Q(S, x)y)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 exp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed x\u222b\n0\n2\u0393(S, x\u2032) dx\u2032\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .\n(6.48)\nThe evolutions of \u03bal(S, x, y) for y = 0 and |y| = 0.7 are shown in Fig. 35 a and b. We see\nthat in the two cases considered the power spectra differ markedly, especially for small x.\nIn particular, the difference shows up as a faster (for |y| = 0.7) decrease of the Strouhal\nnumber corresponding to the spectrum maximum (Stm) with increasing distance from the\nnozzle. This is more easily seen in Fig. 36, where this decrease is given for both cases\nconsidered. As is evident from the figures, the experimental dependences can be well-\napproximated by the curves Stm \u2248 3.2x\u22120.36 (for y = 0) and Stm \u2248 6.5x\u22120.68 (for y = 0.7).\nUnfortunately, experimental data (see Figs. 5 and 6) are available only for the jet axis\n(corresponding to y = 0) and a line offset by the radius from the axis (corresponding\nto y = 1). In the first case our dependence is close to the experimental one, and in the\nsecond case it lies between the experimental ones.\nWe emphasize that our results are obtained from the linear theory without taking account\nof nonlinear phenomena such as the pairing of vortices. These results reinforce our idea\nthat the experimentally observed shift of the power spectrum is explained mainly by the\ndivergence of the jet, not by the pairing of vortices.\nIt should be noted that, as the distance from the nozzle increases, the width of the power\nspectra decreases significantly. This means that the correlation time increases, i.e. the\ncoherence level increases too. This is a cause of the formation of coherent structures.\nThe mean-root-square value of the turbulent velocity pulsations, which is what is usually\n44\nis measured experimentally, is equal to\n\u01ebul(x, y) =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1\n\u03c0\n\u221e\u222b\n0\n\u03bal(S, x, y) dS. (6.49)\nThe plots of \u01ebul(x, 0) and \u01ebul(x, 0.7) versus y are presented in Fig. 37. It is seen from\nFig. 37 a that the dependence of \u01ebul(x, 0) on x closely resembles the dependence of an\norder parameter on temperature for a slightly noisy second-order phase transition. This\nalso reinforces our hypothesis that the onset of turbulence is a nonequilibrium noise-\ninduced phase transition of the second order, similar to that for a pendulum with a\nrandomly vibrated suspension axis.\nIt is interesting that for y = 0.7 the root-mean-square value of turbulent velocity pul-\nsations first decreases and then increases with increasing x. This can be explained by\nthe competition between the amplification of the pulsations and the swift decrease of the\nspectrum width. The condition for validity of all results obtained in this paper is that\n\u01ebul(x, y) \u226a 1. We see that along the jet axis the results are valid for almost the whole\ninitial part (x < 8), whereas for y = 0.7 they are valid only for x < 5. The change of\n\u01eb(x, y) as x increases is correlated with the change of the mean velocity (see below), but\nthese changes are not fully identical.\nLet us trace the changes of the group wave velocity at St = Stm, as well as of the wave\nlengths in the longitudinal and transverse directions (\u03bblon\n(\nStm, x\n)\n= 2\u03c0\/K(Stm, x) and\n\u03bbtr\n(\nStm, x\n)\n= 2\u03c0\/\u0393(Stm, x), respectively), with increasing x. The results are presented\nin Fig. 38. It is seen that along the jet axis, as the distance from the nozzle increases,\nthe group velocity vgr\n(\nStm(x)\n)\nfirst decreases and then increases, whereas for y = 0.7\nit decreases monotonically. The longitudinal wave lengths increase considerably in both\ncases, providing evidence for an increase in the scale of the turbulence in the longitudinal\ndirection. Along the jet axis the transverse scale of turbulence increases too, whereas\nfor y = 0.7 it changes nonmonotonically. The increase of the scale of turbulence in the\nlongitudinal direction agrees with the experimental data and reveals itself in the pairing\nof vortices.\n45\n6.2 The first approximation\nPutting\n\u2202A1\n\u2202x\n\u223c \u2202A1\n\u2202y\n\u223c \u01eb2,\nsubstituting (6.1) into Eqs. (5.36), (5.37) and equating the terms of order \u01eb we obtain the\nfollowing equations:\nr1 \u2212\u2206s1 = 0, q1 = \u2202s1\n\u2202y\n,\n(6.50)\n\u2202r1\n\u2202t\n+ ud(x, y)\n\u2202r1\n\u2202x\n+ vd(x, y)\n\u2202r1\n\u2202y\n\u2212 \u2126dy(x, y) \u2202s1\n\u2202x\n+ \u2126dx(x, y)\n\u2202s1\n\u2202y\n\u2212 2\nRe\n\u2206r1 = R(t, x, y),\nwhere\nR(t, x, y) =\n\u2202\u03c80\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u21260\n\u2202y\n\u2212 \u2202\u21260\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u03c80\n\u2202y\n, (6.51)\nand \u03c80 and \u21260 are defined by the expressions (6.43).\nWe suppose that only waves for which the sign of S is opposite can interact, an assumption\nthat is justified for dispersive waves. It should be noted that the interaction of waves with\nthe same sign of S results in the generation of second harmonic, whereas the interaction of\nwaves for which S is opposite in sign results in the appearance of a constant level. Because\nthe difference\n\u2202\u03c8\n(S)\n0\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u2126\n(S)\n0\n\u2202y\n\u2212 \u2202\u2126\n(S)\n0\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u03c8\n(S)\n0\n\u2202y\nis small, the second harmonic is also small. It is therefore sufficient to consider the in-\nteraction only of waves for which S is opposite in sign. In so doing, it should be borne\nin mind that A1(\u2212S) = A1(S) and Q(\u2212S) = \u2212Q(S). Thus, we can set A1(S)A1(S\u2032) =\n2\u03c0A2(S)\u03b4(S\u2032 + S), where A(S) = |A1|(S). In this case R(t, x, y) is independent of t, and\nwe can represent it as\nR(x, y) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nRs(S, x, y) dS. (6.52)\nA solution of Eqs.

(6.65)\nIt should be noted that the functions r\u02dc1s, s\u02dc1s and q\u02dc1s are slow functions of x.\nWe emphasize that the function \u3008q1(x, y)\u3009 determines the dependence on x and y of the\nadditional constant correction to the dynamical constituent of the longitudinal velocity,\ni.e. the change of the mean velocity due to nonlinear effects. This change is caused by\nturbulent pulsations. It is intuitively obvious (and confirmed by experiment) that the\ncorrection found over region I must be negative, i.e. turbulent pulsations must decrease\nthe mean flow velocity in region I.\nAveraging (6.62), substituting (6.46) into \u3008q1s(S, x, y)\u3009 and integrating over S we can find\n\u3008q1(x, y)\u3009 for different values of x and y \u2264 y1(x).

It is seen from Fig. 39 a that the mean velocity profile becomes increasingly\nbell-shaped as x increases. Furthermore (see Fig. 39 b), within the initial part (x \u2264 8)\nthe velocity on the jet axis decreases significantly only at its end, and then by no more\nthan 5%.

An example of such profile for x = 8 (the end of the initial part) is given\nin Fig. 40 a. For comparison, the corresponding profile of the dynamical constituent of\nthe velocity is shown in the same figure. We see that these profiles differ substantially. It\nshould be emphasized that the velocity profile that we have found by taking account of\nthe stochastic constituents coincides in form with experimentally measured profiles.\nUnfortunately, we cannot calculate exactly the full velocity profiles, or the change of\nvelocity, for all y because we are restricted to regions I and II and take no account of\nstrong nonlinear effects. However, we can calculate the width of the internal and external\nparts of the boundary layer. If we take for the internal boundary the plane where the\nmean velocity is equal to 0.95U0, and for the external boundary the plane where the\nmean velocity is equal to 0.05U0, then these boundaries are as shown in Fig. 40 b. Our\nresults demonstrate that the boundaries of the mixing layer are very far from being the\nstraight lines adduced by many researchers. Up to a certain value of x, these boundaries\nnearly coincide with the boundaries of the mixing layer for the dynamical constituents.\nOnly for larger x do they strongly move apart.\n6.3 The second approximation\nTo derive the equation for the amplitude A1 in the second approximation, we set in the\nexpansion (6.1)\n51\nr2(t, x, y) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nC(S) sinh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n)\nexp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ediSt\u2212 i\nx\u222b\n0\nQ(S, x) dx\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 dS,\n(6.70)\ns2(t, x, y) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nD(S) sinh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n)\nexp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ediSt\u2212 i\nx\u222b\n0\nQ(S, x) dx\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 dS,\nwhere C(S) \u223c \u01eb2 and D(S) \u223c \u01eb2 are unknown amplitudes.\nLike the first approximation, the second approximation can be found analytically only\nover regions I and II. For simplicity, we restrict our consideration to region I.\nEquating the terms of order \u01eb2 in Eqs. (5.36), (5.37) for region I, neglecting the derivatives\nof Q(S, x) with respect to x and taking account of (6.70), we obtain the following system\nof approximate equations for C and D with determinant equal to zero:\nC = \u22122Q(S, x)\n(\ni\n\u2202A1\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u2202A1\n\u2202y\ncoth\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n))\n,\n(6.71)\ni\n(\nS\u2212Q(S, x)\n)\nC = \u2212Q(S, x)\n(\n\u2202r1(x, y)\n\u2202x\ncoth\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n)\n+ i\n\u2202r1(x, y)\n\u2202y\n)\nA1,\nwhere r1(x, y) is defined by (6.53), (6.61).\nFrom the condition of compatibility of Eqs. (6.71), we find a truncated equation for the\namplitude A1 over region I. It can be written as\ntanh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n) \u2202A1\n\u2202x\n+ i\n\u2202A1\n\u2202y\n= \u03a6(S, x, y)A1, (6.72)\nwhere\n\u03a6(S, x, y) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\nF (S, s, x, y)A20(s) exp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed2\nx\u222b\n0\n\u0393(s, x\u2032) dx\u2032\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 ds, (6.73)\nF (S, s, x, y) =\n1\n2\n(\nQ(S, x)\u2212 S\n)\n[\n2\u0393(s, x)r\u02dc1s(s, x, y)) + i tanh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n) \u2202r\u02dc1s(s, x, y)\n\u2202y\n]\n(6.74)\nand A0(S) = |A1(S, 0, 0)|.\n52\nEquation (6.72) can be conveniently rewritten in terms of\nz(S, x, y) = ln\n(\nA1(S, x, y)\nA1(S, 0, 0)\n)\n(6.75)\nas\ntanh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n) \u2202z\n\u2202x\n+ i\n\u2202z\n\u2202y\n= \u03a6(S, x, y).

(6.77)\nSubstituting (6.77) into Eq. (6.76), taking into account that F (S, s, x, y) and w(S, s, x, y)\nare slow functions of x, and neglecting the derivative of w with respect to x we obtain\nthe following equation for w(S, s, x, y):\n\u2202w\n\u2202y\n\u2212 2i\u0393(s, x) tanh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n)\nw = \u2212iF (S, s, x, y)A20(s). (6.78)\nThe solution of Eq. (6.78) with initial condition w(S, s, x, 0) = 0 is\nw(S, s, x, y) = \u2212iA20(s)\ny\u222b\n0\nF (S, s, x, y\u2032)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed cosh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n)\ncosh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\u2032\n)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\u22122i\u0393(s,x)\/Q(S,x)\ndy\u2032 . (6.79)\nAfter substituting (6.79) into (6.77) and integrating over s, we find z(S, x, y).\nKnowledge of z(S, x, y), in view of (6.75), allows us to find \u3008A2(S, x, y)\u3009 and the mean value\nof the phase shift. Taking account of (6.75) and using the assumption that |z(S, x, y)| \u226a 1\nwe find\n\u3008A2(S, x, y)\u3009 \u2248 \u3008A20(S)\u3009\n(\n1 + 2Re\n[\n\u3008z(S, x, y)\u3009\n])\n,\n(6.80)\u2329\n\u03d5(S, x, y)\u2212 \u03d5(S, 0, 0)\n\u232a\n\u2248 Im\n[\n\u3008z(S, x, y)\u3009\n]\n,\nwhere\n53\n\u3008z(S, x, y)\u3009 = \u2212 i\n2\u03c0\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03ba(s, 0)\nK2(s, 0) + \u03932(s, 0)\nexp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed2\nx\u222b\n0\n\u0393(s, x\u2032) dx\u2032\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\u00d7\ny\u222b\n0\nF (S, s, x, y\u2032)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed cosh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n)\ncosh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\u2032\n)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\u22122i\u0393(s,x)\/Q(S,x)\ndy\u2032 ds, (6.81)\n\u03ba(S, 0) is defined by (6.47).\nThe spectral constituent of the longitudinal velocity pulsations is\nu(S, x, y) =\n(\nA1(S, x, y)Q(S, x) cosh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n)\n+\n\u2202A1(S, x, y)\n\u2202y\nsinh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n))\n(6.82)\n\u00d7 exp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ediSt\u2212 i\nx\u222b\n0\nQ(S, x) dx\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .\nBecause of the smallness of z(S, x, y) we have A1(S, x, y) \u2248 A0(S)\n(\n1+z(S, x, y)\n)\n. It follows\nfrom here that the spectral density of the longitudinal velocity pulsations, with account\ntaken of nonlinearity, can be represented as\n\u03ba(S, x, y) = \u03bal(S, x, y)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed1 + 2\u3008z(S, x, y)\u3009+ 2 tanh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n)\nQ(S, x)\n\u2202\u3008z(S, x, y)\u3009\n\u2202y\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (6.83)\nwhere \u03bal(S, x, y) is determined by (6.48).\nIt follows from (6.81) that for y = 0, in the approximation under consideration, the relative\nnonlinear correction\n\u2206\u03ba(S, x, y) = 2\u3008z(S, x, y)\u3009+\n2 tanh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n)\nQ(S, x)\n\u2202\u3008z(S, x, y)\u3009\n\u2202y\nto the spectral density \u03bal(S, x, y) is absent. For y 6= 0, however, this correction is essential,\nand it increases with increasing y and x. Examples of the dependences of \u2206\u03ba on the\nStrouhal number St for y = 0.7 and a number values of x and for x = 8 and three values\nof y are given in Fig. 41 a and b, respectively. It is seen that for x \u2264 5 and y = 0.7 the\nnonlinear correction changes nonmonotonically with increasing x, even changing its sign.\nOnly for x > 5 the changes become monotone, and nearly for all values of St the correction\nis negative. The latter means that for these St the nonlinearity causes the saturation of\nturbulent pulsations. We note that the saturation occurs only from a certain value of\n54\nthe Strouhal number. For smaller Strouhal numbers the nonlinear amplification occurs in\nplace of the saturation.\nTwo examples of the velocity pulsations spectral density (for x = 6, and y = 0.5 and 0.7)\nwith taking into account of the nonlinearity are illustrated in Fig. 42. For comparison\nthe corresponding spectral densities calculated in the linear approximation are shown in\nthe same figure. It is seen that the nonlinearity results in the significant decrease of the\nspectral density maximal value, and as a consequence in the decrease of the turbulent\npulsations variance. It is seen from Fig. 42 that, for x = 6, the spectral density for y = 0.5\nis more than for y = 0.7, even in linear approximation; whereas for small x it increases\nmonotonically with increasing y.\nWe note that \u2202\n\u2329\n\u03d5(S, x, y)\n\u232a\n\u2261 \u2206K(S, x, y) gives a nonlinear correction to the wave number\nK(S, x). It is important to note that this correction depends on the transverse coordinate\ny. It follows from (6.80) and (6.81) that it is\n\u2206K(S, x, y) \u2248 \u2212\n\u221e\u222b\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03ba(s, 0)\nK2(s, 0) + \u03932(s, 0)\n\u0393(s, x) exp\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed2\nx\u222b\n0\n\u0393(s, x\u2032) dx\u2032\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\u00d7Re\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\ny\u222b\n0\nF (S, s, x, y\u2032)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed cosh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\n)\ncosh\n(\nQ(S, x)y\u2032\n)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\u22122i\u0393(s,x)\/Q(S,x)\ndy\u2032\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fb ds. (6.84)\nThe value of \u2206K(S, x, y) determines a nonlinear correction \u2206\u03bblon to the longitudinal wave\nlength \u03bblon\n(\nS, x\n)\n= 2\u03c0\/K(S, x):\n\u2206\u03bblon = \u2212 2\u03c0\u2206K(S, x, y)\nK2(S, x)\n. (6.85)\nBecause nearly for all St the values of \u2206K are negative, we can conclude that the non-\nlinearity causes the faster increase of turbulence scales with increasing x, in comparison\nwith the results of linear consideration.\n55\n7 Conclusions\nThe theoretical approach proposed above has enabled us to account for many experimental\nresults, and to demonstrate that a number of widely-accepted interpretations are in fact\nerroneous. It has led us to a somewhat different and, we believe, more realistic perspective.\nIn particular \u2013\n(1) Our studies show that the shift of velocity pulsation power spectra to the low-\nfrequency domain is caused mainly by the jet divergence, not pairing of vortices,\nso that it can therefore be calculated within the linear approximation.\n(2) The observed phenomenon of vortices pairing can be accounted for in terms of the\nincrease in the longitudinal and transverse turbulent scales, which is caused by jet\ndivergence and not by resonance relations.\n(3) The transformation of the mean velocity profile can be found without the use of the\nconcept of turbulent viscosity.\n(4) The influence of nonlinearity close to the jet symmetry plane (y = 0) is very small\nwithin the initial part of the jet, but increases significantly as we approach the\nboundary layer.\n(5) The intensity of random disturbances at the nozzle exit necessary for the onset of\nturbulence may be very small. Our quasi-linear theory is valid only for such small\nintensities. For larger disturbance intensities, the development of turbulence is from\nthe very outset an essentially nonlinear process.\n(6) The change of the velocity pulsation variance with distance from the nozzle closely\nresembles changing order parameter with increasing temperature for a second order\nphase transition. That is why we guess that the onset of turbulence can be considered\nas a specific noise-induced phase transition similar to that for a pendulum with a\nrandomly vibrated suspension axis.\n56\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge useful discussions with G.
