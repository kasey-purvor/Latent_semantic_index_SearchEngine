Current Opinions in Critical Care, 13, 732-736 \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nResearch in healthcare has shown patients to frequently experience unnecessary harm \nas a result of preventable medical errors. These events can result in the substantial and \nunnecessary suffering of patients, as well as a high financial cost in terms of extended \nhospital stays and litigation costs [1]. In terms of managing patient safety within the \nintensive care unit (ICU), the complex and multidisciplinary nature of intensive care \nmedicine renders it particularly susceptible to the occurrence of medical errors. \nWithin high-risk settings such as aviation and nuclear power, which share similar \nissues of work complexity, poor communication between team members has \nfrequently been identified as causal factors in major incidents that have resulted in \nlarge loss of life [2, 3]. Within these settings, substantial research has been conducted \nto understand the factors that influence team communications [4, 5], and team training \ncourses have been developed to train and assess communication skills [6]. Research in \nthe ICU has shown poor communication between team members to be a common \ncausal factor underlying adverse events [7], yet unlike other high-risk industries the \nrelationship between team communications and safety in ICUs is less well \nunderstood, as are the factors that influence team member interactions under both \nnormal and stressful operating conditions. Thus, there is a requirement to better \nunderstand how the communication behaviours of clinicians can contribute to patient \nsafety in the ICU [8]. This article considers recent research into aspects of \ncommunication and error within the ICU, and briefly considers work in similarly \ncomplex acute medical settings.  \n \nCommunication skills and error in the ICU \nPatients in the ICU have been shown to be particularly susceptible to experiencing a \nmedical error. The multinational Sentinel Events Evaluation study has documented \nthe number of critical incidents (an occurrence that harmed, or could have harmed, a \npatient) that occur during a standard 24-hr period in ICUs across 29 countries [9**]. \nIn a sample of nearly 2000 adult patients, critical incidents were found to affect \napproximately 20% of patients. The most frequent errors were associated with \nmedications and lines, catheters and drains, and patients were most susceptible to \nerror during mid-morning. Considering the relatively high likelihood of experiencing \na critical incident whilst receiving intensive care, ICU research has attempted to \nascertain common causes of error. In particular, the relationship between safety and \nPublished as: Reader, T, Flin, R, & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Communication skills and error in the Intensive Care Unit. Current Opinions in Critical Care, 13, 732-736 \n \n 4 \ncommunication error in the ICU has been recognised for some time [7]. In one of the \nmost extensive human factors investigations of error in the ICU, Donchin and \ncolleagues [10] found that although nurse and doctor communications were found to \noccur in just 2% of all activities performed in the unit, these were associated with over \na third of detected errors. Alongside safety, communication skills in the ICU have \nalso been shown to be important for the quality of care received by patients. For \nexample, high levels of collaboration between nurses and doctors being shown to \nresult in improved patient mortality rates and reduced average patient length of stay \n[11, 12].  \n \nError reporting systems now frequently focus upon poor communication as an \nantecedent to error in the ICU. An recently conducted analysis of published ICU \ncritical incident studies found that just under half of all contributory factors \nunderlying critical incidents were related to non-technical skills (e.g. teamwork and \ndecision-making), with poor communication frequently being reported as contributing \nto the occurrence of critical incidents [13**]. The review concluded that information \non the contributory role of communication is often superficial, with little analysis \nbeing performed on the team members most susceptible to error, or the specific \ncommunication problems that result in critical incidents. Pronovost and colleagues \n[14**] recent report on web-based patient safety reporting systems has provided a \nricher source of data for understanding the role of poor communication in critical \nincidents. Their reporting system was voluntary and anonymous, and collected data \non 2075 incidents from 23 ICUs over a period of 24 months. It was found that the \nmost common forms of error were related to medications (42% of incidents), \nincorrect\/incomplete delivery of care (20%), equipment failure (15%), and lines, \ntubes, and drain (13%). Of those, the events involving lines, tubes, and drains were \nmost likely to cause patient harm (48% of events). A wide range of factors were found \nto underlie critical incidents, with team factors contributing to 32% of errors. In total, \n57% of those errors were related to problems with verbal or written communication \nduring routine care, 37% were related to problems with verbal or written \ncommunication during handovers, 21% were related to team structure and leadership, \nand 6% were related to problems in verbal or written communication during crises. \nExamples of incidents included clinician\u2019s not communicating order changes to \nnursing staff, incorrect patient information being passed between different teams, and \nPublished as: Reader, T, Flin, R, & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Communication skills and error in the Intensive Care Unit. Current Opinions in Critical Care, 13, 732-736 \n \n 5 \npoor information dissemination on severely ill patients being transferred to ICU. Due \nto the prevalence of team factors in critical incidents, Pronovost and colleagues \n[14**] have stressed the importance of implementing team-training programmes and \nteam based activities (e.g. multidisciplinary rounds) that encourage interdisciplinary \ncommunication during patient decision-making. Furthermore, ensuring that junior \nteam members feel able to communication openly on issues of patient care with senior \nteam members is also identified as crucial for safety.  \n \nBeyond studying the role of communication in incidences of medical error in the ICU, \nresearch has also examined the effect of improving interdisciplinary communication \nupon patient safety [15*]. In the US, quality improvement initiatives have involved \nimplementing physician led multidisciplinary rounds where clinicians encourage all \nteam members to communicate and contribute to the patient decision-making process. \nThe introduction of this intervention was associated with a decline in adverse event \nrates over the course of a year. Jain and colleagues [15*] reported that better \ncommunications during rounds were central to the improvements, as they enhanced \nenhancing interdisciplinary teaching and the coordination of patient care. Attitudinal \nresearch has also provided some interesting data, finding that positive perceptions of \nteamwork and communication are associated with lower self-reported error rates in \nthe Netherlands [16*]. Specifically, positive perceptions on factors such as timely and \naccurate information transfer were associated with lower perceptions of errors, \nalthough no predictive relationships were established. Lastly, Puntillo and McAdam \n[17*] have discussed the importance of clear and constructive communication for \nimproving end-of-life care in the ICU. Specifically, nurses have reported that there is \npoor communication between nurses and doctors during decision-making on end-of-\nlife care [17*]. In particular, differences in training and perspective are cited as \nresulting in communication problems, with a lack of communication on issues of end-\nof-life care resulting in poorer information being provided to patient\u2019 families [18].  \n \nIt can be found that studies of error in the ICU have shown poor communication to \nfrequently be a causal factor in critical incidents. Furthermore, some insight has been \nprovided on the communication skills important for maintaining patient safety. Whilst \nexamining the link between communication and clinician error is important for \nunderstanding how patient harm occurs in the ICU, the data returned from these \nPublished as: Reader, T, Flin, R, & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Communication skills and error in the Intensive Care Unit. Current Opinions in Critical Care, 13, 732-736 \n \n 6 \nstudies are limited in terms of understanding how team communication behaviours \ncan affect team performance during routine and emergency situations. However, \nresearch using critical care simulators has provided some provided insight into \ncommunication skills and ICU team performance.   \n \nCommunication skills and team performance in simulator studies \nHigh-fidelity simulators can be useful for investigating the communication skills that \nare most likely to result in effective team performance, with research investigating the \ncommunication behaviours of intensive? care teams during simulated emergencies. \nFor example, Lighthall and colleagues [19] study of critical event scenarios in the \nICU demonstrated the utility of simulation for understanding communication and \nerrors in ICU teams. Their analysis of communication errors during team performance \nfound team members to not communicate their care priorities to one another, that \nphysicians overloaded nurses with requests leading to key tasks not being performed \npromptly, that ineffective leadership resulted in ineffective use of time and personnel, \nand that in some instances there was an absence of communication on the initiation of \nnew therapies.  \n \nHigh-fidelity simulator studies have also been used to examine the communication \nabilities of ICU residents during the resuscitation of critically ill patients [20**]. \nThrough analysing videos of Canadian ICU residents resuscitating simulated patients, \nresidents were assessed on their communication skills alongside their skills for \nleadership, problem solving, situational awareness and resource utilization. Experts on \nresuscitation and critical care used a behavioural rating system to assess the \nbehaviours of residents. The communication skills of residents were rated most highly \nif they communicated clearly at all times, encouraged input and listened to staff \nfeedback, and consistently used directed verbal and non-verbal communications. \nResidents were rated poorly if they did not communicate with staff, did not \nacknowledge staff communications, and never used directed verbal and non-verbal \ncommunications. Overall, participants were found to perform well, with residents who \nhad three years post-graduate training being found to produce higher scores than those \nwith one-year of post-graduate training. However, reliability testing found relatively \npoor consistency in the ratings of communication performance, indicting some \nrevision was required on the system used to rate performance. Furthermore, no \nPublished as: Reader, T, Flin, R, & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Communication skills and error in the Intensive Care Unit. Current Opinions in Critical Care, 13, 732-736 \n \n 7 \nrelationship between communication skills and objective measures of team \nperformance were reported.  \n \nOttestad and colleagues [21**] have also developed a scoring system for assessing the \ncommunication and teamwork skills of critical care teams. In particular, teams are \nassessed during the management of septic shock in a high-fidelity patient simulator, \nwith the relationship between teamwork and technical performance being examined. \nFor this study, participants included ICU residents and a support team of nursing staff, \nrespiratory therapists and anaesthesiologists. Based on crew resource management \n(CRM) principles from aviation, seven dimensions of behaviours (e.g. teamwork, \nplanning, leadership), were assessed with good communication underpinning high-\nlevels of performance on most dimensions. For example, teams were rated highly if \nthey made clear and direct requests, employed closed loop communications, delegated \ntasks effectively, communicated the urgency of patient problems, prioritised aspects \nof care effectively, made sure all team members were comfortable with their allotted \ntasks and shared information on the patient care plan. Teams were rated poorly if they \ndid not request appropriate information, delegate tasks, and did not communicate \npriorities and patient problems. Teams rather than individuals were assessed, and \ncorrelations were found between ratings on technical performance (e.g. making \ndiagnosis, antibiotic use, placing an additionally intravenous catheter) and scores on \nthe behavioural aspects of performance (i.e. teamwork and communication).  \n  \nCommunication research in other acute medical environments \nInvestigations of communication and error in the ICU have provided useful \ninformation for understanding the relationship between teamwork and patient safety \nin intensive care medicine. However, an extensive amount of research has examined \nthe relationship between communication and error in other domains of acute \nmedicine, and especially within the operating theatre. Whilst the findings from these \nstudies related to the operating theatre, they feature themes that are pertinent to \nintensive care medicine.  \n \nWilliams et al [22**] have recently conducted an extensive analysis of \ncommunication errors in the operating theatre. In an examination of 328 incident \nreports where poor communication contributed to errors, numerous factors were \nPublished as: Reader, T, Flin, R, & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Communication skills and error in the Intensive Care Unit. Current Opinions in Critical Care, 13, 732-736 \n \n 8 \nfound to result in communication problems. These included factors such as the \nineffective delegation of responsibilities, poor role clarity, shift changes, patient \nbackground information not being communicated, nurses not attending patient rounds, \nhierarchical team structures, and inaccurate assumptions on the knowledge and skills \nof team members. Based on these findings, a number of detailed suggestions were \nproposed for improving communication between surgeons and residents; for example \nimproving documentation during handovers, and ensuring experienced surgeons are \nalways made aware of the knowledge and skill base of junior residents. Observational \nstudies of surgical cases have also provided useful information on the relationship \nbetween poor communication and error [23**]. Observations on 10 complex surgical \ncases found poor communication and information flow to have a negative effect on \nteam performance as a whole. In total, 88 distinct events being identified when \ninformation was lost or degraded (e.g. when surgeon communicated patient \ninformation to the team), with 86% of these events having consequences for \nprogression patients from one stage of the operation to another. Furthermore, patient \nhandovers and the movement of patients from one phase of care to the next (e.g. from \nthe operating theatre to the recovery room) were most vulnerable for information loss \nand inadequate discussion of clinical information was identified as a commonly \noccurring error. Lastly, a recent review of surgical malpractice claims identified the \nmost common types of communication breakdown that were reported as harming to \npatients. Insufficient verbal communication between attending surgeons and other \nteam members was shown to frequently result in poor information transfer between \nteam members, with patient transfers and handovers again being particularly \nsusceptible to communication problems [24*]. Thus communication studies in the \noperating theatre have shown the importance of certain communication skills (e.g. \ngood handovers, team discussions on clinical information, understanding team \nmember information needs) in terms of reducing the probability of errors occurring. \nThese are likely to also be important for the intensive care environment.  \n \nImproving communication in intensive care \nDeveloping tools for training and assessing communication and teamwork in the ICU \npresents a substantial challenge. Within surgery attempts have also been made to \nunderstand and model the factors that predict effective teamwork [25*, 26*], and to \ndevelop team training and assessment tools [27]. These tools are based on an \nPublished as: Reader, T, Flin, R, & Cuthbertson, B. (2007). Communication skills and error in the Intensive Care Unit. Current Opinions in Critical Care, 13, 732-736 \n \n 9 \nextensive task analysis to understand the specific teams skills important for safety and \nthe behaviours that indicate proficiency in those skills [28*, 29, 30]. Whilst \ninterventions and tools do currently exist for improving communication within the \nICU [31], there remains significant work to be done. In particular, the work tasks \nperformed by ICU caregivers are highly varied, with teams admitting patients, \ndiagnosing illnesses, developing treatment plans, performing complex procedures, \nmaking end-of-life decisions and liaising with families and other hospital units \n[32**]. Furthermore, the communication strategies used to manage activities in the \nICU have been found to vary significantly depending on the task [33], and to \ninfluence the cognitions of ICU team members [34*]. Therefore, in order to develop \ntailored team-training interventions, further research is required to better identify the \ncommunication skills and behaviours crucial for maintaining safety. A range of \ntechniques exist to do this, including cognitive interviews, hierarchical task analysis, \nobservations during real and simulated performance, studies of cognition, attitudinal \nsurveys and root-cause analyses of errors.  \n \nConclusions \nPoor communication and teamwork frequently contribute to occurrences of medical \nerror in the ICU. Furthermore, interventions to improve communication in the ICU \nhave resulted in reduced reports of adverse events and simulated scenarios have \nshown that effective communication between team members is correlated with \nimproved technical performance. However, compared to domains such as surgery, the \ncommunication and teamwork skills important for safety are less well defined. As \ncritical care teams perform a multitude of activities requiring effective \ncommunication, there is a requirement to better identify and understand the \ncommunication skills associated with safety in the ICU during specific tasks.  \n \n \n \nPublished as: Reader, T, Flin, R, & Cuthbertson, B.
