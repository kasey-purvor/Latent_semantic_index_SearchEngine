His \ndestination was Plaine Verte, the usual place of public execution, for four days earlier the \nCourt of Assizes had sentenced him to death. Rughobursing spoke his final words \nthrough Faride Dina, the government interpreter. They were recorded, and the statement \nwas signed by the officials present - G. Leffray, the Judge of the Court; H. Bury, the \nClerk; and Faride Dina. It read: \u2018\u201cGhunna had hit him first and so he had to hit him back. \nHe did not know if Ghunna was dead or not.

Farquhar, took up the position after serving \nas Lieutenant-Governor of Penang, which had been a penal settlement since 1789. He \nwas thus well versed in the utility of convict labour, and shortly after he arrived in \nMauritius he wrote to the Indian authorities requesting a supply. At the time, either \ngovernment slaves or corv\u00e9e slaves were employed on public works; slave owners being \nobliged to lend each of their slaves to government for four days per year. This labour \n After 1828, new British settlements in \nArakan and the Tenasserim Provinces (Burma) received Indian convicts too. Earlier \nshipments to Bencoolen had ended in 1825, when the settlement was returned to Dutch \ncontrol. Most convicts in the penal settlements were put to labour on public works \nprojects. Some built and repaired roads and bridges, cleared land and quarried stone. \nOthers worked in agriculture, cultivating commercial products like silk, spices and tea. A \nsignificant minority were employed as overseers, clerks and cooks within the convict \ndepartments or hired out to private settlers.  \n                                                 \n2 MA JA52: Report of G.

Farquhar saw convicts as a \nsolution to this shortage, a cheap and more controllable alternative to the hiring of local \ncontract labourers. Indentured labour migration had not yet got underway. In comparison \nto the population of slaves in Mauritius, and the half million indentured labourers who \nmigrated to the island after 1834, the number of convicts transported to the island was \nrelatively small. Indeed the first Census of 1826 recorded a population of 9,000 whites, \n14,000 Indians, Chinese and creoles (Mauritian-born) and 63,000 slaves.6 At the time, \nthere were just over five hundred convicts on the island.7 However, despite their limited \nnumbers, convicts were highly valued and much praised for building the communications \nnecessary for the further development of the sugar industry. Indeed, the archives are \nreplete with petitions from plantation owners all over the island calling for an increase in \nthe number of convicts employed in the districts.8 I would argue that transportation \ntransformed convicts into \u2018penal labourers\u2019.9 They were punished through work, \nbecoming economically productive labourers and actors in what we might term the \ncolonial theatre of punishment.10\n                                                 \n6 PRO CO172\/42: Baron d\u2019Unienville, Tableaux de Statistiques, no. 6.  \n The lessons of punishment were both directed at convict \ngangs and projected back to India, where from the beginning of the nineteenth century \n7 IOL P\/139\/32: Numerical Return of Bengal Convicts shewing the Casualties that have occurred from the \nyear 1815 to 31st July 1829 inclusive. \n8 Anderson, Convicts in the Indian Ocean, p. 44. \n9 A phrase borrowed from Raymond Evans and William Thorpe\u2019s assessment of convict labour in colonial \nMoreton Bay (Queensland), \u2018Power, Punishment and Penal Labour; Convict Workers and Moreton Bay\u2019, \nAustralian Historical Studies, 25, 98 (1992), p. 109. \n10 On punishment, profit and signification, see Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the \nPrison, London, 1977, p. 109.  \n4 \nprisoners had a relatively sophisticated understanding of what transportation entailed.11\nOn March 18 1826, Rughobursing was sentenced to imprisonment for life in \nCalcutta\u2019s Alipur Jail, the largest penal institution in India. He had been convicted of \n\u2018wounding two persons so as to cause their death and wounding two other persons\u2019, \nthough we know nothing more about the case. We are on firmer ground with his social \norigins. Rughobursing was from Benares, and a Bhumihar: a Brahmin community which \nhad taken up agriculture.\n \nThis article seeks to explore the events leading to Rughobursing\u2019s execution as a means \nof untangling some of the complexities of this economic, social and penal transformation.  \n12 He was literate enough to sign his name on his later court \nstatements. Like many convicts transported from inland areas of the Bengal Presidency \n(and later indentured labourers) he probably spoke Bhojpuri. Two years after \nRughobursing was sent to jail he applied for the commutation of his sentence to \ntransportation. All life prisoners were entitled to apply for such a commutation, a \nprivilege that was granted in 1828 due to the weight of their demands.13 Shortly after \nsubmitting his petition, Rughobursing was shipped to Mauritius on the Lord Amherst, \ntogether with thirty-nine other convicts. The ship left Calcutta on June 19 1828, arriving \nin Mauritius almost two months later on August 16.14\n                                                 \n11 Clare Anderson, \u2018The Politics of Convict Space: Indian penal settlements and the Andamans\u2019, in Alison \nBashford and Carolyn Strange, eds, Isolation: places and practices of exclusion, London, 2003, pp. 40-55. \n  \n12 K.S.

Godna was designed as an irrevocable mark of both individual and \ncollective criminal identity. Different types of tattoos could even delineate convicts as \npart of a criminal sub-population, notably thugs, of whom hundreds were transported \noverseas, mainly to the Tenasserim Provinces, from the 1830s. Rughobursing was also \ntattooed, though we do not know the details of the inscription, as we do for some other \nconvicts. His descriptive roll, compiled for the purpose of identification, read: \u2018Brown \ncolour, wide forehead, joint eyebrows, sheep\u2019s eyes, nose high, both ears bored, \nmoderately stout, height 5 feet 8 1\/3 inches, aged 25 years, marked on the forehead by the \nprocess called Godena\u2019.16\nGodna was supposed to act as a deterrent against escape, a particular risk when \nprisoners were put to work on extra-mural labour, as they were in India until shortly after \nthe publication of the Report of the Committee on Prison Discipline in 1838,\n \n17\n                                                 \n15 IOL V\/8\/17: Regulations passed by the Governor-General in Council, volume II, 1796-1803, Calcutta, \n1803, p. 387.

Its purpose was twofold. First, marked convicts \n16 MA JB266: Extract from List of Convicts embarked per Lord Amherst, 19 June 1828 (convict no. 11 \nRughobursing).  \n17 IOR P\/141\/9: Second and Concluding Report of the Committee of Convict Labour, 28 Jan. 1837; Report \nof the Committee on Prison Discipline, 8 Jan. 1838, Calcutta, 1838, p. 17. \n6 \nwere unable to pass themselves off as free. Second, ideally tattoos pointed to particular \nwritten records. This facilitated the recognition of groups of convicts and individuals, \nmaking the recapture of escaped convicts by colonial officials, or local communities in \nIndia and the penal settlements easier. The Governor of the Straits Settlements \n(Singapore, Penang and Malacca) wrote in 1842 that a mark on the forehead was often \nthe only means to distinguish convicts from free Indians or other settlers.18 When \ntransportation from Bombay to Mauritius began in the late 1820s, there was an explosion \nin convict desertion (marronage), for Bombay convicts were not tattooed on the \nforehead. Added to the increasing number of indentured Indian labourers migrating to the \nisland, Bombay convicts were able to escape into the Indian population without \ndifficulty.19\nAfter Rughobursing\u2019s transportation ship, the Lord Amherst, arrived in Mauritius, \nthe convicts on board were sent to Grand River just outside Port Louis, where the convict \nheadquarters were located.\n  \n20\n                                                 \n18 IOL P\/403\/15: S.G. Bonham, Governor Straits Settlements, to J.P. Willoughby, Secretary to Government \nBombay, 12 Nov. 1842.   \n Typically, after arrival Indian convicts were separated into \nworking parties of between thirty and forty men, and employed on public works all over \nthe island, often at some distance from Grand River. The convict system was driven by \nthe economic wants of new British territories like Mauritius - the desire for cheap labour \nto build infrastructure. The despatch of transportation ships across the Indian Ocean and \nto Southeast Asia depended entirely on each settlement\u2019s willingness to receive convicts. \nIf they would not take them, convicts were not sent. However, in order to guarantee a \n19 MA Z2A62: W. Staveley, Head of Convict Department, to Finniss, 13 Apr. 1831. \n20 MA RA383: Staveley to G.A. Barry, Secretary to Government Mauritius, 18 Sept. 1828.  \n7 \ncontinuing supply of convicts, the settlements had to assure the Indian presidencies that \ntheir penal concerns were being satisfied. It was not unknown for the presidencies to cut \noff the convict flow if they felt offenders were not being properly punished. In the mid-\n1830s, for instance, the Madras Government suspended transportation to the Straits \nSettlements, because it believed that the sentences of hard labour passed on all \ntransportation convicts from the presidency were not being carried out there. It only \nresumed transportation after Madras Presidency convicts in the Straits were transferred to \nthe Tenasserim Provinces, to where new shipments were subsequently sent.21\nPenal settlements worked hard to convince the mainland authorities that the \nlabour performed by convicts was both a punishment and a means of reform. As early as \n1797, the East India Company had written of hard labour in the penal settlements as a \nmeans through which convicts could be restrained from \u2018habits of idleness and \ndissipation.\u2019\n \n22 By the time regulations were passed for the organisation of convicts in \nMauritius in 1818, the amount of labour necessary to effect moral reformation had been \ncalculated precisely, conveniently dovetailing with the nine to ten hour working day.23\n                                                 \n21 TNSA Madras Judicial Proceedings (henceforth MJP) vol. 291: J.F.

There was also the claim that convicts were not only \nseparated from their former kin networks, but prevented from interacting with local \npopulations. During the early years of transportation to Mauritius, for instance, convicts \nwere forbidden from interacting with slaves (all contact was banned in 1818).26\nGiven the conflicting aims of the presidencies and the penal settlements, it is \nperhaps inevitable that there were massive contradictions between discourses of penal \nlabour and practices of convict management. Many of these were drawn out in the Report \nof the Committee on Prison Discipline (1838), which although mentioning Mauritius only \nin passing (it was not Company territory) complained of the generally lax treatment that \nconvicts elsewhere enjoyed, particularly in the Straits Settlements. It called for \u2018the strict \nand uniform observance of the rules\u2019 and for the labour of convicts to be \u2018turned to the \nbest account.\u2019\n \n27\n                                                 \n24 IOL P\/134\/48: Governor T.S. Raffles to W.B. Bayley, Secretary to Government Bengal, 27 June 1820. \n The administrators of the penal settlements were faced with two main \ndifficulties in this respect. First, a continuing supply of convicts could only be procured if \nthey could convince the authorities in India that they had a penal agenda. However, from \nthe first years of transportation, it was clear to the settlements that if the system was to \noperate successfully, practices of convict management had to be flexible. If the prospect \n25 IOL P\/136\/23: J.W. Hull, Superintendent of Convicts Penang, to E. Presgrave, Acting Secretary to \nGovernment Fort Marlborough, 1 Jan. 1824.  \n26 PRO CO167\/37: Acting Governor Hall to Bathurst, 28 Jan. 1818. \n27 Report of the Committee on Prison Discipline, p. 12 (recommendation 51).  \n9 \nof limited freedoms was not held out to convicts - most of whom were transported for life \n- they would have little incentive to work efficiently and be more likely to abscond. Thus \nconvicts were permitted freedoms that frequently surprised the Indian authorities. \nSecond, the employment of convicts on infrastructural projects invariably required their \nwide dispersal over large areas. This spatial dynamic meant that it was not unusual for \nworking parties to be based some hours, if not days, away from convict headquarters. \nThis made uniform discipline, particularly in relation to social segregation, a practical \nimpossibility.  \nConvicts in all the penal settlements struck up multiple relationships with local \npopulations. Mauritian convicts traded with slaves, creoles and, after the abolition of \nslavery, apprentices (ex-slaves) and indentured labourers. They gambled, smoked and \ndrank with them, married them and had children. As I have argued elsewhere, this \nautonomy was ignored, tolerated or even encouraged by the local authorities in Mauritius, \nfor it encouraged economic self-dependency and social stability.28 Yet this clashed with \nthe mainland penal agenda, as an 1805 report into convict discipline in Bencoolen \nreveals. R.S. Perreau, Magistrate and Superintendent of Convicts in Bencoolen, \nresponded to criticisms from India in this respect: \u2018I had no place of close confinement \nfor [convicts]; nor could I confine them employed in labour miles from each other. I \ncould not check their sexual behaviour with women, which I am blamed for. Neither am I \na reformer of their morals. My duty was to provision them; work them; and to prevent \ndisturbances.\u201929\n                                                 \n28 Anderson, Convicts in the Indian Ocean, ch. 5.  \n  \n29 IOL P\/129\/22: R.S.

Parr, Resident \nBencoolen, 4 Oct. 1805.  \n10 \nBy 1829, Rughobursing had been moved to Rivi\u00e8re du Rempart, a northern \ndistrict of Mauritius. It was here that he had his first run in with the authorities, \nattempting to strike his overseer, Donald Cormack, with a crow bar.30 European \noverseers were an obvious target for assault. Although there are no records of what \nprecipitated Rughobursing\u2019s attack, one can trace the sort of grievances that provoked \nothers. At about the same time, in Malacca, Overseer Wiggins was murdered by a convict \nwho had been flogged and sent to the chain gang for neglect of duty.31 Some years later, \na group of convicts in Kyaukpyu (Arakan) who had been refused admission into hospital \nwhen they said they were ill attacked their jailor, Mr Colombs.32 In punishment for his \nattempted assault, Rughobursing was put in heavy irons for two months and sent back to \nPort Louis, close to the Grand River convict headquarters, later that year.33\nAt the end of 1829, Rughobursing was arrested and charged with the attempted \nmurder of two of his convict camarades, Looteeah and Kalooa.\n \n34 It was alleged that he \nhad beaten Looteah so badly that his skull was fractured and he almost died.35\n                                                 \n30 MA JB221: Extract Convict Punishment Book, Rivi\u00e8re du Rempart, 8 Aug. 1829.  \n The day \nafter the attack, with Looteah lying seriously injured, the police interviewed Kalooa and \nRughobursing. Kalooa said that he had gone to buy some potatoes with Looteah from a \nSunday market. Shortly afterwards, a third convict came up to them and demanded they \n31 IOL P\/140\/49: S Garling, Resident Councillor Malacca, to S.G.

As far as he was aware, no convicts held a grudge against Loteeah, \nand Rughobursing had not been provoked. When Rughobursing was questioned, he \ndenied all knowledge of the incident. He claimed that he had seen Kalooa and Looteah \nthat day on his way to market, and that they were so drunk that they had fallen over. They \nsaw him, so he suspected that they might accuse him of something untoward.36\nWhen the case came to trial, Kalooa and Looteah repeated their story, and \nRughobursing again claimed that he knew nothing about their injuries. Unfortunately for \nhim, Jean Marie Giotot and his slave Mercure, the potato sellers, had witnessed the \nassault and positively identified Rughobursing as the assailant.\n \n37 He was found guilty, but \nbecause he was already under sentence of transportation the court was not empowered to \npunish him further. They sent him back to the discipline of his working party, their only \npenal option.38 The Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, concerned that Rughobursing was escaping the \nfull penalty of the law, referred the case to the Court of Appeal. It sentenced him to two \nyears\u2019 imprisonment, and he was transferred to Port Louis jail.39\nIndian penal settlements promoted a system of convict management that \nemployed both incentives and punishments. Incentives included assignment to preferred \ntasks, removal from road gangs, or gratuities in cash or kind.

Deserving convicts were employed as \nartificers or in the salt works and received a monthly gratuity. Other privileges related to \ntheir lodgings, freedom of movement and access to the courts.43 Five years later, the \nBencoolen Regulation was adapted for Penang, Singapore and Malacca.44 It then \nprovided the basis for the Straits\u2019 more complex Butterworth Rules, adopted across the \nSettlements in 1845.45\n                                                 \n40 PRO CO415\/15: Barry to Rossi, 27 Jan. 1816; Recueil Complet des Lois et R\u00e9glemens de l\u2019ile Maurice, \nou ile de france; Tome Premi\u00e8r, Cinqui\u00e8me Partie, Port Louis, 1823: Proclamation 193, 24 Jan. 1816. \n The ultimate incentive for a convict was a ticket-of-leave. After a \ncertain period of time, convicts were released from labour and allowed to live at large, on \nthe condition that they steered clear of the police and the courts.

If they broke the law, \nthey could be tried in court, and imprisoned or retransported (in the case of Mauritius, to \nRobben Island or one of the Australian settlements). One Bengal official eloquently \nsummed up the aim of the 1820 Bencoolen class system thus: \u2018the influence resulting \nfrom the desire of promotion on one hand and the fear of degradation on the other must \nhave the most beneficial operation on the conduct of the prisoners.\u2019\n  \n47 Colonial officials \nclaimed that the system reformed convict souls, but only through the threat or \nperformance of particular interventions on their bodies. In this sense, there was more of a \nmutual interdependence than a decisive shift in penal strategies, which were themselves \ninterlinked with the development of early colonial economies. I am reminded here of \nFoucault\u2019s description of the material basis of power relations: the mutual exclusivity of \n\u2018the accumulation of men and the accumulation of capital\u2019.48\nRughobursing was released from jail a month after his imprisonment because the \njail authorities had been unable to control him. They reported that in one incident he had \nalmost killed another inmate. The Chief of Police, John Finniss, reported that \nRughobursing strode about the prison, claiming that he was afraid of nothing, not even \n  \n                                                 \n46 IOL P\/129\/32: A regulation for the management of the convicts transported from Bengal to Fort \nMarlborough, 5 Aug. 1806.  \n47 IOL P\/135\/19: H.J.

He said that he had already killed three people, perhaps a reference in part to the \ncrime for which he had been transported. Other prisoners were apparently afraid of \nRughobursing and what might happen next. The Chief Medical Officer examined him, \nand concluded that he was suffering from a temporary mental derangement. He was sent \nto hospital while Finniss petitioned that he be taken off his hands. Superintendent \nWilliam Staveley ordered that Rughobursing be returned to the Convict Department and \nonce again worked in the heaviest irons there.49\nA few years later Rughobursing was moved to the district of Savanne in the south \nof the island. It was here that the events for which he was sentenced to death took place. \nIn July 1834, Rughobursing brutally attacked another convict named Ghunna, the convict \ncommander of his working party. He also assaulted three officials: the Superintendent of \nConvicts in the district, John Hewitt, and two overseers named Joseph Workmen and \nGeorge Harrison Carter. This time, Rughobursing admitted what he had done, but his \nclaim about the motive for the attack contradicted what Ghunna and the overseers said. \nBefore he died, Ghunna was interviewed by the police. He said that Rughobursing had \nattacked him because in his capacity as convict commander, he had recently punished \nhim for working after hours.\n  \n50 If this was the case, Rughobursing\u2019s complaint that he had \nbeen reprimanded by his commander for working after hours would have been a serious \none, for such entrepreneurship was normally encouraged.51\n                                                 \n49 MA RA431: Finniss to Barry, 21 Aug. 1830, enclosing Police Report, 18 Aug. 1830; Staveley to Finniss, \n9 Sept. 1830. See also MA RA435: Police Report, 19-20 Aug. 1830.  \n Rughobursing, however, \nmade a more complex claim. He said that Ghunna owed him money for a piece of blue \n50 MA JB266: Police Report, 11 July 1834. \n51 Anderson, Convicts in the Indian Ocean, pp. 107-8.  \n15 \ncloth he had sold him on credit. Each time he had asked for the cash, Ghunna threatened \nto tell the European overseers, or to have him put in the stocks. Rughobursing added that \nsome time previously he had given Hewitt, Workmen and Carter a not insubstantial bribe \nof fifteen piastres (Spanish dollars) on the promise that he would be made a convict \ncommander. They had pocketed the money and gone back on their word. Since then, \nHewitt had treated him so badly that he had complained to the Surveyor General, J.A. \nLloyd (by this time, the officer in charge of convicts).52 A month after the attack, Ghunna \ndied. He had multiple stab wounds to and fractures of the face, some of which had turned \ngangrenous.53 And so Rughobursing was charged with murder. In October the Court of \nAssizes found him guilty and he was sentenced to death.54\nPrecariously balanced within the system of rewards and punishments were those \nfew convicts, like Ghunna, selected to oversee their fellow transportees. Their duties \nincluded taking the daily roll calls, marching their working party to and from work, \noverseeing labour, and administering punishments for petty misdemeanours. These \nconvicts - known variously as commanders, cotwals, jemadars or tindals - were supposed \nto be promoted on the basis of continued good behaviour, though it is possible that those \nwith access to financial resources were able to secure the position. Convict commanders \ncould be removed from their position at any time, a humiliating and socially isolating \nexperience. One Mauritian commander, Mattadon, who was removed from his post in \n1819, even hanged himself rather than return to a working party.\n \n55\n                                                 \n52 MA JB266: Court of First Instance, Evidence of Rughobursing, 11 Aug. 1834. \n That there was the \n53 MA JB266: Report of A. Montgomery, Civil Surgeon, 17 Aug. 1834.  \n54 MA JB266: Sentence of the Court of Assizes, 25 Oct. 1834.  \n55 MA RA142: Rossi to Barry, 29 Nov. 1819. \n16 \npotential for resentment against convict commanders is hardly surprising, for they \nenjoyed considerable privileges, in terms of financial and other advantages. By 1823, \nthere were forty commanders in Mauritius, each entitled to a gratuity of \u00a31-4-0 per \nmonth, in addition to their usual rations and monthly payment of one rupee.56 Tindals \nelsewhere in the Southeast Asian settlements enjoyed similar privileges.57 Yet attacks \nagainst convict commanders were quite unusual; in most cases, they were assaulted \nduring the course of an escape attempt.58 Commander Ghunna, however, had been \nattacked before. Earlier in 1834 a convict named Malagee Naragee had stabbed him, \nthough we do not know why. Overseer Hewitt had been attacked at the same time.59\nA position of command was something that convicts could aspire to, and the \nauthorities thought this encouraged good behaviour. The Superintendent of Convicts in \nSingapore, G.D. Coleman, summed up the system thus: \u2018It is \u2026 good policy to make it as \ncomfortable and well worth having as possible, for it is to the competition for chapras \n[badges of authority] among the most enterprising and intelligent; that having nothing to \nhope for would be most likely to be seditious. I attribute the general good conduct of the \nconvicts to this.\u2019\n  \n60\n                                                 \n56 PRO CO172\/47: Civil and Judicial Establishments for 1827, Department of Roads and Bridges Blue \nBook 1825-7.  \n What Coleman did not mention were other benefits convict \ncommanders could hope to gain, for there is evidence to suggest that some were well \nversed in bribery and extortion. It is possible that one of the reasons that assaults against \n57 IOL P\/136\/31: Phillips\u2019 Minute, 15 Apr. 1824. \n58 See for example: IOL P\/140\/73: E.A.

That convicts in Mauritius were heavily involved in theft, trafficking, \ntrading and capital accumulation is beyond dispute.62\nRughobursing also accused his European overseers of extortion, stating that they \nhad told him that they would make him a commander on payment of a bribe. He had \nhanded over the cash, but they had not done so. This allegation remains unsubstantiated, \nbut other evidence does give it some credence. By all accounts, the overseers in Mauritius \nwere a disorderly bunch, frequently absent from their work and fond of liquor. In 1820, \nthe Head of Convicts Francis Rossi wrote that he only had confidence in four of them \u2013 \n\u2018the others being generally careless, inattentive, disobedient to orders and many of them \ngiven to drunkenness\u2019.\n  \n63 In 1830, an overseer on the Pamplemousses Road was taken off \nduty after he was caught selling moonshine liquor, distilled with the help of his convict \nworking party.64 In Mauritius, a few convicts set themselves up as moneylenders; \nincredibly their clients included their overseers. In 1833, Overseer Thatcher claimed that \nthe Chief Overseer himself, William Clover, owed one convict eighty shillings, another \none hundred rupees and \u2018a very considerable amount\u2019 to several more.65\n                                                 \n61 As argued by Peter Zinoman for colonial Vietnam: The Colonial Bastille: A History of Imprisonment in \nVietnam, 1862-1940, Berkeley, 2001, p. 112.  \n What provoked \nRughobursing to attack Overseer Cormack some years before his arrest is a matter of \n62 Anderson, Convicts in the Indian Ocean, ch. 5.  \n63 MA RA137: Rossi to Barry, 14 June 1820.  \n64 MA Z2A59: Finniss to G.F.

However, his claim that his Savanne overseers had extorted money from him \nwas not entirely fanciful.  \nOverseer Simon Goss made a third claim about the motive for Rughobursing\u2019s \nassaults. He wrote that the attacks had a quite different motive: they were carefully \ncalculated attempts to get off road gang labour. Goss wrote that convicts generally \nbelieved that they would better off in jail than on public works. After he had attacked \nGhunna, Malagee Naragee had been sentenced to a year in prison. The other convicts \nregarded this as a holiday. He was convinced that Rughobursing had committed the \nassaults with this in mind.66 It is difficult to say whether Goss was attempting to shield \nhis fellow overseers from disciplinary action, or whether these were genuine sentiments. \nHis opinion was taken seriously at the time, however, for shortly afterwards, a \nGovernment Ordinance was passed, tightening up the regulations for the punishment of \nconvicts convicted of certain secondary offences.67\nCentral to the secondary punishments dished out to convicts was their public \ndisplay. With the exception of execution, the most dramatic of all punishments in this \nrespect was flogging. Until 1852, convicts could be beaten with a rattan cane; both the \nflogging itself and the infections it often caused were severe.\n  \n68\n                                                 \n66 MA JB266: Overseer S.

Yet it is clear that it was not used \nvery often. One record notes that just fourteen out of the 1319 convicts living in \nSingapore in 1845 were flogged.71 No matter how many convicts were actually flogged, \nhowever, all convicts worked under the threat of the cane and would have been aware of \nits power. Floggings were administered in full view of convict working parties, usually \non muster day when all were present. As Coleman wrote in 1844, this ensured floggings \nhad \u2018the greatest degree of publicity.\u201972 In Mauritius, they took place either at the Grand \nRiver headquarters or a punished convict\u2019s working party in his district.73\nPublic executions were even more dramatic. In 1805, Connye Tackoor was \nsentenced to hang in Bencoolen. He was taken to the place of execution in front of all the \nremaining convicts, and only then told that his sentence had been commuted.\n  \n74\n                                                 \n69 IOL P\/144\/20: Report of A.P.

Despite the discourse of penal labour, the system held \nout limited freedoms to convicts. Penal settlements were porous institutions. Convicts \nhad some freedom of movement, and engaged in entrepreneurial activities. Hierarchies of \npunishment were also blurred. The socio-economic relationships between Indian convicts \nand their European overseers were complex, and convicts too were integrated into the \npenal hierarchy. To some extent, then, convicts determined elements of their experience \nof colonial punishment, as Rughobursing\u2019s claims about what precipitated the assaults \nshow. If Overseer Goss was correct in his assertions about the motive for Rughobursing\u2019s \nattack on commander Ghunna, however, his attempt to manipulate the boundaries of his \npunishment was a fatal mistake, for ultimately the colonial authorities determined those. \nRughobursing overstepped the mark, and instead of enjoying a break from road labour in \njail, met his fate on the guillotine. As convict Connye Takoor, petitioning for the \ncommutation of his recently passed capital sentence in Bencoolen, wrote in 1805: \u2018I am \nthe Company\u2019s slave, whether I have, or have not stolen the Company[\u2019]s goods is now \nout of the question, I have been convicted \u2026 I am a poor Brahmin, you are Ruler.\u201981\n                                                 \n81 IOL P\/129\/22: Petition of Connye Takoor, 27 Oct. 1805.  \n \n"}
