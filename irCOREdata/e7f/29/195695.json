Here we report observations of one such plasma bubble, made by the four Cluster spacecraft and Double Star TC-2 around 14:00 UT on 21 September 2005, during a period of southward, but BY-dominated IMF. In particular the first direct observations of return flows around the edges of a plasma bubble, and the first observations of plasma bubble features within 8 RE of the Earth, consistent with MHD simulations (Birn et al., 2004) are presented. The implications of the presence of a strong BY in the IMF and magnetotail on the propagation of the plasma bubble and development of the associated current systems in the magnetotail and ionosphere are discussed. It is suggested that a strong BY can rotate the field aligned current systems at the edges of the plasma bubble away from its duskward and dawnward flanks","downloadUrl":"http:\/\/www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/725\/2009\/angeo-27-725-2009.html.","fullTextIdentifier":"https:\/\/lra.le.ac.uk\/bitstream\/2381\/7806\/3\/Cluster%20and%20Double%20Star%20multipoint%20....pdf","pdfHashValue":"6e2f259e59d1a7e91abfbcf47476c7368aa3c6c1","publisher":"Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/7806<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2016-01-29T12:19:14Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_1<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9549<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_10633<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nCluster and Double Star multipoint observations of a plasma bubble<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nWalsh, A.

Magnetospheric physics (Current systems;\nMagnetotail; Plasma sheet)\nCorrespondence to: A. P. Walsh\n(apw@mssl.ucl.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nThe exact mechanism by which magnetic flux and plasma are\ntransported sunward through the Earth\u2019s magnetotail plasma\nsheet has been an active topic of research since the Dungey\nCycle of magnetospheric convection (Dungey, 1961) was\nfirst proposed. In recent years much effort has been concen-\ntrated on explaining the localised transient fast flows, called\nBursty Bulk Flows (BBFs) by Angelopoulos et al. (1992),\nthat have been observed in the tail and are thought to carry\na significant proportion of mass and magnetic flux earthward\nduring more geomagnetically active periods. The nature of\nthe processes behind their creation and propagation, and their\nrole in the development of substorms and other large-scale\nmagnetotail phenomena, however, are still uncertain. One\ntheoretical explanation that has been put forward for these\nBBFs is that they are depleted flux tubes, also called \u201cplasma\nbubbles\u201d (Chen and Wolf, 1993, 1999). Plasma bubbles were\nfirst suggested by Pontius and Wolf (1990) as a possible\nsolution to the so-called \u201cpressure balance inconsistency\u201d,\nwhereby the adiabatic transport of magnetic flux and plasma\nearthward from the mid- to near-tail was shown to result in\nplasma pressures in the near-tail which are far too high to be\nconfined by magnetic field intensities that are consistent with\nobserved values (Erickson and Wolf, 1980).\nA plasma bubble is a flux tube that has a lower entropy,\ni.e. pV \u03b3 (where \u03b3 is the ratio of specific heats; p is the\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n726 A. P. Walsh et al.: Cluster and Double Star plasma bubble\nplasma pressure within the flux tube and V the volume per\nunit magnetic flux of the flux tube integrated over the flux\ntube\u2019s length, given by\n\u222b\nB\u22121 dS. S is the length of the flux\ntube), than surrounding flux tubes, which convects earthward\nunder the action of the interchange instability. Because of its\nlower entropy content, the depleted flux tube cannot support\nas much gradient-curvature-drift current as neighbouring flux\ntubes and excess current is diverted into field aligned cur-\nrent systems at the boundaries of the bubble, flowing into the\nionosphere on the dawnward boundary and out of the iono-\nsphere on the duskward boundary, similar to the substorm\ncurrent wedge concept. Recent simulations by Sitnov et al.\n(2005) have suggested that reconnection on closed field lines\nin the plasma sheet would eject a small plasmoid tailwards,\nand might also result in the formation of a plasma bubble.\nObservations interpreted as plasma bubbles have been re-\nported by Sergeev et al. (1996), for example, who, using\nISEE 1 and 2 (then located at XGSM\u223c\u221220RE), identified\nseveral bubbles by looking for a decrease in plasma pres-\nsure and a concurrent sharp, transient dipolarisation in the\nmagnetic field. Magnetic shear regions just outside the bub-\nble boundary were also identified. From the sense of mag-\nnetic shear in these regions (i.e. the sign of BX\u00b7\u03b4BY ), it was\ndetermined whether the spacecraft entered the bubble on its\ndawnward or duskward side (Sergeev et al., 1996, Fig. 2). If\nBX\u00b7\u03b4BY is positive the spacecraft entered the bubble on the\ndawnward edge and vice versa. The presence of field-aligned\ncurrents at the edges of plasma bubbles were inferred from\nthese magnetic shear observations. Additionally, the bubble\nboundaries were found to be, in almost all cases, tangential\ndiscontinuities and the cross-tail extent of the bubbles was es-\ntimated to be between approximately 1RE and 3RE , consis-\ntent with later work on BBFs using the Cluster spacecraft by\nNakamura et al. (2004). The expected field-aligned currents\nfor the bubble model have also been detected at the bound-\naries of BBFs (e.g. Nakamura et al., 2005), and the currents\nwithin a BBF as a whole have been quantitatively compared\nwith the brightness of an auroral streamer and found to be\nsimilar (Forsyth et al., 2008), lending support to the idea that\nauroral streamers are the ionospheric manifestation of these\ntail phenomena (Amm and Kauristie, 2002, and references\ntherein).\nUsing 3-D MHD simulations, Birn et al. (2004) deter-\nmined that the pressure along a depleted flux tube need not\nbe constant or steady. Their simulations showed that a newly\nformed plasma bubble would quickly reach a total pressure\nbalance with surrounding flux tubes. According to the sim-\nulation, at the central plasma sheet this pressure balance\nwould be achieved through the plasma pressure returning to\nits undisturbed value soon after its initial depletion; this is in-\nconsistent with some observations (e.g. Sergeev et al., 1996),\nhowever. Further away from the equatorial plane, in lower\ndensity regions, the plasma pressure would remain low and\npressure balance would be attained through an increase in\nthe magnetic pressure. This would set up a plasma pressure\ngradient within the flux tube, resulting in field aligned flows\nfrom the equatorial plane to the poles. Over time these flows\nwould cause a build-up of plasma in the near-Earth \u201chorns\u201d\nof the flux tube, evidenced as an increase in plasma pressure\nand commensurate decrease in magnetic pressure within the\nflux tube.\nIn this paper we present observations from the four Cluster\nspacecraft and the Double Star TC-2 spacecraft of what we\ninterpret to be a plasma bubble penetrating to within 8RE\nof the Earth, provide direct evidence of the existence of the\nexpected return flows around the flanks of the plasma bubble,\nreport other features of the plasma bubble that are not present\nin simulations, and discuss the possible effects of a strong\nmagnetotail BY on plasma bubbles.\n2 Observations\n2.1 Event context and overview\nOn 21 September 2005 between 13:45 UT and 14:15 UT the\nfour Cluster spacecraft (hereafter referred to as C1, C2, C3\nand C4) were operating in a high telemetry rate \u201cburst\u201d mode\nand located at GSM (\u221214.5, 2.6, 1.2)RE near midnight MLT\nin the Earth\u2019s magnetotail, while Double Star TC-2 was lo-\ncated at GSM (\u22126.74, 1.42, \u22121.39)RE (see Fig. 1, panels d\u2013\nf). In the 2005 tail season, the Cluster spacecraft were in\na so-called \u201cmultiscale\u201d configuration, with C1, C2 and C3\nmaking a triangle of side \u223c 10 000 km in the plane of a model\nneutral sheet while C4 was displaced \u223c1000 km in \u223cZGSM\nfrom C3, forming a flattened tetrahedron (see Fig. 1, pan-\nels a\u2013c). This configuration allows for the study of current\nsheet thickness and motion with C3 and C4, while the large\nseparation between C1, C2 and C3\/C4 is designed to pro-\nvide contextual information and study the cross-tail extent of\nlarger features such as BBFs. The large flattened tetrahedron,\nhowever, precludes the use of certain multi-spacecraft anal-\nysis techniques, for example the curlometer (Dunlop et al.,\n2002), when studying features of a similar scale to BBFs.\nDuring the interval of interest the Interplanetary Magnetic\nField (IMF), as measured by the MFI instrument (Smith\net al., 1998) on board the ACE spacecraft, was directed pre-\ndominantly southward and duskward, with clock angles be-\ntween 90\u25e6 and 135\u25e6, and had been for some time (Fig. 1,\npanels g\u2013k). The FUV-WIC imager (Mende et al., 2000) on\nboard the IMAGE spacecraft detected a substorm onset at\n14:05:55 UT (Frey and Mende, 2006). The cadence of WIC,\nhowever, means that the actual onset time could be up to\n2 min earlier. Figure 2 shows FUV-WIC images around the\ntime of substorm onset, with the magnetic footprints of TC-\n2 and C3, as calculated from the T96 magnetic field model\n(Tsyganenko and Stern, 1996), with inputs from High Res\nOMNI solar wind data, marked as black diamond outlines\njust duskward of midnight MLT. The spacecraft footpoints\nwere located within a few degrees MLAT and a few minutes\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 725\u2013743, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/725\/2009\/\nA. P.

The coloured squares show line of sight veloc-\nity, positive towards the appropriate radar, the contours are\nequipotentials derived from the map-potential technique and\nthe T96 Cluster footpoint is marked by the black circle. The\nionospheric velocities detected by the TIGER radars are pre-\ndominantly duskward so despite the lack of backscatter at the\nfootpoint itself, it is reasonable to assume that the velocity in\nthe ionosphere at this point will have a significant duskward\ncomponent. It should be noted that the equipotential contours\nare derived from an IMF-driven statistical model constrained\nby available data, so the contours by themselves cannot be\nused to prove the presence of any flow as expected for a par-\nticular IMF direction.\nIn Fig. 4 data from the four Cluster spacecraft, taken dur-\ning the period of interest, are plotted.

Between 13:46 UT and\n13:48 UT, C2, the southernmost spacecraft, measured a de-\ncrease in |B| from 19 nT to 9 nT and an increase in electron\nfluxes consistent with the spacecraft moving closer to the\nneutral sheet. C2 then crossed the neutral sheet at 13:51 UT.\nA minimum variance analysis (Sonnerup and Scheible, 2000)\non this crossing (not shown here) determined the neutral\nsheet normal to be almost perfectly aligned with GSM Z,\nand consequently to provide orientation with respect to the\nneutral sheet GSM coordinates will be used throughout this\npaper unless otherwise stated. C1, C3 and C4 also observed\ndecreases in |B| of \u223c10 nT as they approached the neutral\nsheet. C1 and C3 observed this decrease between 13:50 UT\nand 13:53 UT, accompanied by increases in electron flux. C4\nobserved the decrease over a much longer period (13:52 UT\nto 13:59 UT) but saw a similar increase in electron flux to\nthe other spacecraft at 13:53 UT. Because C2 was the south-\nernmost spacecraft and C4 the northernmost, the timing of\nthese decreases in |B| is consistent with the plasma sheet\nmoving northward over the Cluster tetrahedron. While an\nexpansion of a moving plasma sheet over the spacecraft can-\nnot be ruled out, in this case it is unlikely that a static plasma\nsheet expanded over the spacecraft because relatively slow-\nmoving spacecraft, such as Cluster near apogee, initially lo-\ncated as they were away from the neutral sheet, would not\nbe expected to cross the neutral sheet during such an expan-\nsion.

The electron\nspectrograms are taken from PEACE-HEEA on all space-\ncraft apart from C3 where a non-functioning anode makes\ncomparison of fluxes at different pitch angles difficult. The\nenergy range of the LEEA sensor still covers the majority of\nthe electron distribution and as such data from that sensor are\nused for C3.\nC1, C3 and C4 all observed similar features during this\nperiod, consistent with the passage of a plasma bubble over\nthose spacecraft. All three spacecraft observed a sharp in-\ncrease in BZ , marked by a vertical dashed line on each fig-\nure. C1 detected it first at \u223c13:58:55 UT, C3 and C4 detected\nit \u223c30 s later (Figs. 5, 7 and 8, panels a). A smaller sharp\nchange in BX was also detected at the time of dipolarisation;\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/725\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 725\u2013743, 2009\n732 A. P. Walsh et al.: Cluster and Double Star plasma bubble\nC1 and C3 observed a negative \u03b4BX while C4 observed a\npositive \u03b4BX. Contemporary with the dipolarisation the three\nspacecraft detected a sharp drop in perpendicular electron\nfluxes (Figs. 5, 7 and 8, panels e) and an increase in paral-\nlel and anti-parallel electron fluxes (Figs. 5, 7 and 8, panels d\nand f). C1 and C3 detected a decrease in ion pressure at the\ntime of dipolarisation that lasted for \u223c180 s at C1 and \u223c90 s\nat C3. These decreases were accompanied by increases in\nmagnetic pressure which began just prior to dipolarisation\nand peaked at the time of the dipolarisation front arriving at\neach spacecraft. C4 observed a similar increase in magnetic\npressure, although no decrease in proton pressure is evident\nin the somewhat noisy CODIF data (Figs. 5, 7 and 8, pan-\nels c).\nThe behaviour of velocity (Figs. 5, 7 and 8, panels b) is\nalso similar on C1, C3 and C4. In all cases an earthward\nflow (i.e. V\u22a5X>0) was detected. The flow began just be-\nfore the dipolarisation and, on C1 and C3, peaked \u223c15 s after\ndipolarisation. The dipolarisation observed by C4 was con-\ntemporary with the approximate centre of the earthward flow\nperiod, which in this case peaked just prior to dipolarisation.\nThe period of earthward flow continued for approximately\none minute after dipolarisation in the case of both C1 and C3\nwhile on C4 the earthward flow stopped \u223c40 s after dipolar-\nisation. The peak velocities recorded by the ion instruments\nwere \u223c350 km s\u22121, \u223c320 km s\u22121 and \u223c180 km s\u22121 for C1,\nC3 and C4, respectively. In all cases, the earthward flow was\nfollowed by a period of weaker (i.e. |V\u22a5X|<100 km s\u22121) tail-\nward flow, although while C3 and C4 observed this immedi-\nately after the earthward flow, C1 observed a short stagnation\nperiod of duration \u223c90 s where no significant earthward or\ntailward flow was detected. Another enhancement in paral-\nlel and anti-parallel electron fluxes was detected by C1 at the\nsame time as the tailward flow. In the case of C3 and C4, the\nearthward flow stopped at the end of the period of enhanced\nmagnetic pressure\/reduced ion pressure; while for C1, the\nenhanced magnetic pressure\/reduced ion pressure continued\nuntil the short burst of tailward flow and (anti-)parallel elec-\ntron flux enhancement some time after the end of the earth-\nward flow. Slower (i.e. |V\u22a5Y |.100 km s\u22121) dawnward and\nduskward flows were detected by C3 and C4 contemporary\nwith the earthward and tailward flows (i.e. V\u22a5Y and V\u22a5X\nwere in antiphase), again beginning just prior to dipolarisa-\ntion. No significant V\u22a5Y was detected by C1 prior to dipo-\nlarisation, instead a short interval of duskward flow was de-\ntected just after dipolarisation while BX was negative, turn-\ning dawnward when BX became positive. In all cases, a neg-\native V\u22a5Z was detected, beginning at the time of dipolarisa-\ntion.\nC1, C3 and C4 all detected enhanced positive V\/\/ in the\nregion of enhanced magnetic pressure (Figs. 5, 7 and 8, pan-\nels b). In the case of C1 the increase in V\/\/ began just af-\nter the dipolarisation, when BX began to recover from its\nsharp decrease in magnitude. V\/\/ reached a peak value of\n\u223c340 km s\u22121 at 13:59:45 UT, 30 s after the peak in V\u22a5X\nand then decreased gradually to its undisturbed value by\n14:02 UT, when the spacecraft exited the region of enhanced\nmagnetic pressure. C3 detected a slightly different signa-\nture in V\/\/: V\/\/ increased from a higher background level of\n\u223c100 km s\u22121 to a peak \u223c280 km s\u22121, again \u223c30 s after the\npeak in V\u22a5X. The increase began at the time of dipolarisa-\ntion and V\/\/ return to its undisturbed value at the end of the\nperiod of tailward flow, \u223c14:03:30 UT. C4 recorded similar\nfeatures in V\/\/ to C3.\nDuring the same interval C2 observed quite different fea-\ntures. No dipolarisation was evident, nor was there any pe-\nriod of earthward flow. Instead a prolonged period of tail-\nward and dawnward flow was measured in the electron mo-\nments at the same time as increases in magnetic pressure and\n|BX|. In contrast to the other three spacecraft, no significant\nV\u22a5Z was detected, nor any increase in parallel or antipar-\nallel electron fluxes. Indeed these electron fluxes actually\ndecreased, as did the perpendicular electron flux.\n2.3 Double Star TC-2 observations\nIn Fig. 9 data from the Double Star TC-2 spacecraft, taken\nbetween 14:00 UT and 14:05 UT are plotted. Panel (a) shows\nthe three GSM components of magnetic field from the FGM\ninstrument on board TC-2 (Carr et al., 2005), panel (b) shows\nthe three components of magnetic field with the mean field\nremoved, panel (c) shows the magnitude of the field with the\nmean field removed and panel (d) is feather plot of magnetic\nfield vectors (see Volwerk et al., 1996, for example) showing\nany rotations of the magnetic field in a mean-field-aligned\ncoordinate system, whereby one of the axes is defined as the\ndirection of the magnetic field when filtered to remove any\noscillations with periods shorter than ten minutes, a second\naxis is defined as the cross product of the first axis and the\nGSM position vector of the spacecraft and the third com-\npletes a right handed set. Here the mean field axis points out\nof the page, so an anticlockwise rotation of the field vectors\nwith time on the plot represents the effect of a parallel current\nand vice versa. Panels (e\u2013g) are energy-time spectrograms\nfor electrons with pitch angles of 0\u25e6, 90\u25e6 and 180\u25e6, respec-\ntively, as measured by the PEACE instrument on board TC-2\n(Fazakerley et al., 2005). It should be noted that because the\nDouble Star PEACE instrument has one sensor, rather than\nthe two that make up each Cluster instrument, a distribution\ncovering the full energy range is accumulated every two spins\n(i.e. eight seconds) rather than every spin.\nAt 14:00 UT, the TC-2 spacecraft was located south of the\ntail neutral sheet (Fig. 9, panel a), some 7RE antisunward\nof Earth, moving north towards the central plasma sheet. At\n\u223c14:02 UT, the spacecraft detected a small clockwise rota-\ntion in the magnetic field (Fig. 9, panel d) and an enhance-\nment in the flux of parallel electrons (Fig. 9, panel e). At the\nsame time a transient peak inBY is observed (Fig. 9, panel b).\nImmediately following these features, at 14:02:20 UT a tran-\nsient dipolarisation of the field was detected, accompanied\nAnn.

After 14:03 UT\nthe spacecraft entered a more lobe-like environment, as evi-\ndenced by a drop in electron fluxes and increase in magnetic\npressure, before detecting a low energy (i.e. with a peak flux\nat \u223c200 eV) field-aligned electron beam at \u223c14:03:40 UT\naccompanied by a much larger anticlockwise rotation in\nmagnetic field. All of this occurred before the substorm onset\na few hours dawnward in Magnetic Local Time.\n3 Discussion\n3.1 Cluster data\nThe magnetic field dipolarisations and associated plasma\ndata observed by C1 (Fig. 5) C3 (Fig. 7) and C4 (Fig. 8)\nare consistent with signatures predicted by theory, simu-\nlation and previous near-equatorial observations of plasma\nbubbles; namely a transient dipolarisation and earthward\nflow, a reduction in plasma pressure and an increase in\nmagnetic pressure (maintaining approximately constant to-\ntal pressure). Sergeev et al. (1996) interpreted regions of\nearthward-flowing plasma of lower pressure than their sur-\nroundings, accompanied by transient dipolarisations in the\nmagnetic field as plasma bubbles; all of these features have\nbeen reported here. More recently Forsyth et al. (2008) re-\nported enhancements in bidirectional electron fluxes inside a\nstructure interpreted to be a plasma bubble, which were ex-\nplained as a product of reconnection. A similar pitch angle\ndistribution has been observed here by C1, C3 and C4.\nThe entry of the Cluster spacecraft into the depleted flux\ntube (plasma bubble) can be identified from several features\nin the data, most obviously the increases in BZ and PB\n(Figs. 5, 7 and 8, panels a and c) and decreases in PIon and\nperpendicular electron flux (Figs. 5, 7 and 8, panels c and e).\nThe direction of any field-aligned currents detected at the\nedge of a plasma bubble can help determine where a space-\ncraft entered the depleted flux tube, as can the magnetic shear\njust outside the boundary of the plasma bubble (Sergeev\net al., 1996). In general there are several possible ways of\ndetermining if any field-aligned currents are present. The\ncurlometer technique (Dunlop et al., 2002) has been used\nto study larger scale current systems within a bubble at a\n300 km tetrahedron scale size (Forsyth et al., 2008) but can-\nnot be applied here because the scale size of the Cluster tetra-\nhedron in our event is much larger, and is comparable to the\nscale size of previously observed BBFs and plasma bubbles\n. The curlometer is only accurate when used to study cur-\nrents much larger than the scale size of the Cluster tetrahe-\ndron. Furthermore, C2 is located South of the neutral sheet\nwhile the other spacecraft are located North of the neutral\nFig. 9. Data from the FGM and PEACE instruments on board Dou-\nble Star TC-2.

Below we have at-\ntempted to identify any field aligned currents by looking for\nmagnetic shear and also by seeking evidence in the electron\ndata from the PEACE instruments.\nFigures 10, 11 and 12 show data from which the pres-\nence and direction of any field-aligned currents around the\nplasma bubble can be determined.

Each of these methods can be used to\ndetect the presence of FACs and they each have advantages\nand disadvantages as described below.

Pitch angle selection is carried out on-board using the\ninter-experiment link with the FGM instrument and is based\non magnetic field data collected during the previous spin. As\nsuch, should the magnetic field direction change over the\ncourse of one spin the instrument will not necessarily be\nlooking along the field when the pitch angle distribution is\nreturned, giving incorrect data. This data is corrected on the\nground where a rebinning process assigns accurate pitch an-\ngles each PEACE anode. When a full pitch angle distribution\ncannot be recovered this results in data gaps such as those\nseen in the Figs. 10\u201312, panels (d). In a burst mode teleme-\ntry interval in the magnetotail 3-D distributions are returned\nfrom both sensors every spin by C2 and C4, while on C1 and\nC3 3-D distributions are returned from HEEA every spin and\nfrom LEEA for most spins.

In both the 2-D and 3-D cases, because of the po-\nsition of the sensors on the spacecraft, when data from both\nsensors is combined a full pitch angle distribution (albeit a\ndistribution restricted to the energy range covered by both of\nthe sensors) can be collected every two seconds. When a 3-\nD LEEA distribution was unavailable from C1 or C3 for a\ngiven spin interpolation was used to create a consistent time\nseries across all spacecraft. The majority of the electron dis-\ntribution lay within the energy range of LEEA (see Fig. 7,\nbottom 3 panels), so our assumption that most of the electron\ncontribution to the current density is being measured using\nthis method seems reasonable.\nAny shear in the ambient plasma magnetic field caused\nby the passage of a moving flux tube should manifest itself\nin the field component perpendicular to both the direction\nof motion of the flux tube and the flux tube \u201caxis\u201d. For a\ncanonical magnetotail with no significant BY , the shear is in\nthe Y direction (Sergeev et al., 1996). In this case, because\nthere is a strong BY in the tail, that effectively rotates the\nflux tube axis out of the XZ plane, any shear should be in the\nplane perpendicular to the axis. As such, the FGM data in\npanels (c) have been rotated about the GSM X axis such that\nany BY in the undisturbed tail tends to zero, thus any shear\nin the magnetic field caused by the passage of the plasma\nbubble should only appear in the new Y component, Y \u2032.\nC1 detected an increase in BY \u2032 beginning at 13:57:30 UT\n(Fig. 10, panel c) which lasted until the entry into the plasma\nbubble. Because the spacecraft was located north of the neu-\ntral sheet, this field draping is consistent with C1 entering\nthe bubble on its dawnward flank, i.e. BX\u2032 \u00b7\u03b4BY \u2032>0 (Sergeev\net al., 1996). There is evidence of an imbalance in the 0\u25e6 PA\nand 180\u25e6 PA electron fluxes (Fig. 10, panel e) at the time\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/725\/2009\/ Ann.

This fea-\nture, however, occurs over such a short period of time and\nconsists of only two data points. Because of the rapidly\nvarying magnetic field direction at this time, the pitch an-\ngle selection on board the spacecraft was imperfect. This\nresulted in a data gap in the 2-D distributions from which\nthe partial current density (Fig. 10, panel d) was calculated,\nas described above. We cannot be sure, therefore, that the\nimbalance in electron flux was actually a real current. An\nattempt to calculate a \u201cparallel current flux\u201d from the 3-D\ndistributions (not shown) did not reveal any currents larger\nthan the background noise level, presumably because of the\ncoarser angular resolution of the 3-D distributions. Just af-\nter the dipolarisation there was a period of several spins\nwhere PEACE detected a greater flux of 0\u25e6 PA electrons than\n180\u25e6 PA electrons. We suggest this feature is too far from\nthe bubble boundary to represent an FAC at its edge. The\nsharp (i.e. 1 data point) drops in the parallel electron fluxes\nat 13:59:40 UT, 14:00:46 UT and 14:01:25 UT are artefacts\nof the process used to combine data from the two PEACE\nsensors. The magnetic field data then, suggest that C1 en-\ntered the plasma bubble on its dawnward side and while the\nelectron data do not contradict this interpretation, data gaps\nmean that they cannot confirm it either.\nAlthough there is evidence of magnetic field draping on C3\nbefore entering the plasma bubble (Fig. 11, panel c), its dura-\ntion is much shorter than that of the draping observed by C1.\nThis limited draping is still consistent with entry of the space-\ncraft into the dawnward side of the plasma bubble. Just prior\nto the time of dipolarisation there is evidence in the PEACE\ndata of an antiparallel current (Fig. 11, panel d) above back-\nground levels. Although, like on C1, there is a data gap at\nthe time of dipolarisation, in this case the magnitude of the\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 725\u2013743, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/725\/2009\/\nA. P.

In this case the current is consistent with\nspacecraft entry through the duskward edge of the plasma\nbubble since BX>0. This contradictory electron and mag-\nnetic data may be a result of the spacecraft being located\nclose to the centre line of the plasma bubble, although the im-\nperfect electron pitch angle selection and resulting data gap\nat the time of dipolarisation make it is impossible to tell for\nsure. The systematic imbalance between 0\u25e6 PA and 180\u25e6 PA\nelectron fluxes, seen on the bottom panel of Fig. 11 but not\nreflected in the current moments, continues for the entire du-\nration of the burst mode and is most probably a result of an\nimperfect instrument calibration on this particular day.\nC4 seems to show a smaller degree of draping than C1\n(Fig. 12, panel c) though the draping that is evident is con-\nsistent with an entry into the plasma bubble on the dawn-\nward side. The PEACE moments, however, are inconclusive\ncontaining as they do numerous data gaps, again a result of\nimperfect pitch angle selection on board the spacecraft.\nWhile C4 is the only spacecraft that detects a significant\nV\u22a5Y before entry into the flux tube (the flow shear layer pre-\ndicted and observed by Sergeev et al., 1996), C1, C3 and\nC4 observe earthward flow before the entry into the plasma\nbubble. We suggest that this flow represents plasma being\nswept up in front of the earthward moving bubble. This\nsweep-up can be seen as a gradual increase in the perpendic-\nular electron flux (Figs. 10, 11 and 12, panels e) beginning\n\u223c1 min before entry into the depleted flux tube.

Blue arrows mark the motion of the emptied flux tubes as\nthey slip around the sides of the bubble forming the wake.\nin magnetic pressure is also seen closer to the edge of the\nbubble as magnetic flux is also swept up in front of the de-\npleted flux tube (Figs. 5, 7 and 8, panel c). Plasma sweep up\nhas been previously observed by Slavin et al. (2003) in front\nof earthward-moving, BBF type flux ropes.\nThe exit from the plasma bubble is much less clear in the\ndata, in fact different features are observed by the different\nspacecraft. In the case of C1, the earthward flow ended just\nafter 14:00 UT (Fig. 5, panel b), some two minutes before the\nion pressure returns to its undisturbed value (Fig. 5, panel c),\nat which time BZ also decreases to its undisturbed value\n(Fig. 5, panel a). C3 on the other hand detected the end of the\nearthward flow (Fig. 7, panel b) at exactly the same time as\nthe ion pressure (Fig. 7, panel c) returned to its undisturbed\nvalue and BZ (Fig. 7, panel a) decreased, although not all the\nway to its undisturbed value. C4 also observed the end of the\nearthward flow (Fig. 8, panel b) and a decrease in BZ (Fig. 8,\npanel a) at the same time. The examination of perpendicu-\nlar electron fluxes on all four Cluster spacecraft (Figs. 10-13,\nbottom panel, discussion below) will help to resolve this ap-\nparent inconsistency in the data.\nFigure 13, following the same format as Figs. 10\u201312, ex-\namines the PEACE data for C2 in more detail. Given that\nC2 did not observe the plasma bubble, but was instead lo-\ncated duskward of it, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it\nmight be expected that during the tailward flow, depending\non the spatial extent of the field-aligned current system as-\nsociated with the bubble, weak parallel currents would be\ndetected. No currents above the background level are seen in\nthe PEACE data, however (Fig. 13, panel d). Unlike the other\nCluster spacecraft, however, the 0\u25e6 PA and 180\u25e6 PA electron\nfluxes did not increase during the flow period, instead, on av-\nerage, they decreased as did the 90\u25e6 PA electron flux. The\ntailward flows detected by PEACE at this time are consistent\nwith return flows that are expected to be found around the\nedges of a plasma bubble (Birn et al., 2004) which have not\nbeen directly measured in the past. What is not predicted\nby theory or simulation, though, is the decrease in elec-\ntron flux (i.e. plasma density) in the tailward flowing plasma\naround the edges of a BBF. This may be a situation analo-\ngous to plasma depletion layers at the magnetopause (Zwan\nand Wolf, 1976), whereby the flux tubes piled-up in front\nof the plasma bubble are compressed by its earthward mo-\ntion, squeezing the plasma contained within them away from\nthe equatorial plane, before the newly-emptied flux tube slips\naround the sides of the plasma bubble through interchange\nmotion, finally forming a depleted wake behind it. Figure 14\nillustrates this. The increases in V\/\/ observed by C1, C3 and\nC4 (Figs. 5,7 and 8, panels b) before entry into the plasma\nbubble then represent the plasma flowing along the field lines\naway from the equatorial plane, and the increase in PB ob-\nserved by C2 (Fig. 6, panel c) during the lower density tail-\nward flows is the compressed flux tubes slipping around the\nsides of the bubble.\nThe idea of a depleted wake behind an earthward moving\nplasma bubble might also help explain the differences be-\ntween the features that the other Cluster spacecraft observed\nat the end of the earthward flow. C1, C3 and C4 detected a\nsharp drop in perpendicular electron fluxes on entry into the\nplasma bubble, the fluxes then began to gradually increase\n(Figs. 10, 11 and 12, panels e). This gradual increase, how-\never was not smooth. There is a change in the gradient of\nincrease detected for each Cluster spacecraft (but most ob-\nviously on C3) at the time the earthward flow ends. After\nthis change in gradient the electron fluxes were more sta-\nble but still below undisturbed levels, perhaps indicating the\nspacecraft had entered a wake. In the case of C3 and C4,\nthe tailward flows detected during this period (Figs. 7 and 8,\npanel b) are consistent with the idea of infilling behind the\nbubble, while C1 detected a stagnant wake immediately af-\nter the passage of the bubble followed by a tailward flowing\nwake of much shorter duration. All of the spacecraft exit the\nwake at roughly the same time, between 14:02:30 UT and\n14:03:30 UT, the time that C2 exited the region of tailward\nflow. In the case of C1 and C3 this exit was accompanied\nby another increase in bidirectional electron fluxes, while C4\ndetected a decrease. It is clear from these data that the exit\nfrom a BBF\/plasma bubble is not as simple and clear cut as\nsome models and simulations might suggest, and more de-\ntailed studies and simulations of the wakes of these features\nare necessary to fully understand their motion.\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 725\u2013743, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/725\/2009\/\nA. P. Walsh et al.: Cluster and Double Star plasma bubble 739\nFig. 15. An illustrated equatorial cut of the morphology of the plasma bubble, as seen by Cluster. The region of flux and plasma pileup in\nfront of the bubble is in yellow, the bubble itself is grey, the stagnant and tailward flowing wakes lighter and darker blues respectively and\nthe field-aligned current regions green. Flow velocity is marked by the red arrows.\nThe general morphology of this plasma bubble, as inferred\nfrom the Cluster data and described above, is illustrated in\nFig. 15, where velocities are marked in red, the bubble itself\nin grey, regions of FAC in green, the region of plasma and\nmagnetic flux pile-up in yellow and the stagnant and tailward\nflowing wakes in different shades of blue.\nThe cross-tail extent of the plasma bubble can be estimated\nbecause C1, according to the sense of field-aligned currents,\nentered the bubble dawnward of its centre while C2, which\nwas duskward of C1, missed it entirely. This means that the\nentire duskward half of the bubble was bracketed between the\ntwo spacecraft, so an upper limit (i.e. the Y separation of C1\nand C2, \u223c10 000 km) can be placed on the cross-tail extent\nof the duskward half of the bubble. If approximate symme-\ntry either side of the bubble\u2019s centre line is assumed, then\nthis particular bubble cannot extend more than \u223c20 000 km\n(\u223c3RE) across the tail, consistent with previous observa-\ntions (Sergeev et al., 1996; Nakamura et al., 2004). The\nestimated size of the bubble along its direction of motion,\nassuming the bubble itself ends with the earthward flow, is\ndefined here as the peak value of |V\u22a5|, measured after the\ndipolarisation but before the end of the earthward flow, mul-\ntiplied by the elapsed time between the dipolarisation and the\nend of the earthward flow. For C1 and C3 the size of the bub-\nble along its direction of motion was \u223c4RE , while for C4\nthe size was only \u223c1RE .\n3.2 TC-2 data\nTracking the propagation of features through the magneto-\ntail can be problematic (e.g. Walsh et al., 2007). In this\ncase, however, there is evidence that the plasma and mag-\nnetic signatures seen by Cluster (Fig. 4) and TC-2 (Fig. 9)\nare manifestations of the same feature. Figure 16 shows the\nelevation angle of the magnetic field for C1-C4 (panels a\u2013\nd) and the elevation angle of the magnetic field with the\nmean field subtracted for TC-2 (panel e). The disturbances\nin elevation are qualitatively the same (although it should be\nnoted that the scales on the Y-axes for Cluster and TC-2 on\nFig. 16 are different), and the time difference between them\nis consistent with the time taken for a feature to propagate\nfrom C1 to C3, C3 to TC-2 at the velocities measured by\nC1 and C3 to within 15 %. Specifically, the distance trav-\nelled by a flux tube moving Earthward at 350 km s\u22121, the\npeak velocity measured by C1, in the 30 s that elapsed be-\ntween the bubble\u2019s detection at C1 and C3 is 10 500 km. C3\nwas located approximately 9000 km Earthward of C1. In the\n\u223c3 min that elapsed between the bubble\u2019s detection at C3\nand TC2, a flux tube moving Earthward at the peak veloc-\nity detected by C3 would have travelled 57 600 km. TC-2\nwas located \u223c50 000 km Earthward of C3, so a reduction in\naverage velocity of \u223c15% to 270 km s\u22121 would result in the\ncorrect propagation time from C3 to TC-2. While a depleted\nflux tube has not been observed so close to the Earth be-\nfore, a recent study by Takada et al. (2006) determined that\nBBFs observed by Cluster did not always result in a dipo-\nlarisation close to the Earth (at Double Star TC-1 in Takada\net al., 2006), but were more likely to do so when the mag-\nnetic field at TC-1 was more stretched. During the interval\nreported here, X is still the dominant component of magnetic\nfield and has a greater magnitude than the X component of\nthe T96 model field at the location of TC-2. It is consistent\nwith Takada et al. (2006), then, that a BBF could penetrate to\nwithin 7RE of the Earth and cause a dipolarisation. Further-\nmore, the velocity vector (i.e. V\u22a5) measured by C3 points\nat TC-2, increasing confidence that the feature observed by\nCluster is the same as that detected by TC-2.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/725\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 725\u2013743, 2009\n740 A. P. Walsh et al.: Cluster and Double Star plasma bubble\nFig. 16. The GSM elevation angle of magnetic field for the four\nCluster spacecraft (panels A\u2013D) and the latitude angle of dB for\nTC-2 (panel E).\nSimulations have studied the features of a depleted flux\ntube that might be expected close to the Earth (Birn et al.,\n2004), and the effect the presence of a depleted flux tube\nmight have on the inner magnetosphere (Zhang et al., 2008),\nalthough to date no plasma bubbles have been detected at\nXGSM>\u22128RE . Birn et al. (2004) predicted that, close to the\nEarth, after sufficient time had passed since the creation of a\ndepleted flux tube, the plasma depletion and commensurate\nincrease in magnetic pressure that characterise a plasma bub-\nble actually reverse \u2013 field-aligned flows from further down-\ntail transport plasma to the higher latitude, near-Earth region,\nincreasing the local plasma pressure. This causes the flux\ntube to expand, decreasing the magnetic pressure to main-\ntain the pressure balance between the flux tube and its sur-\nroundings. Some of these features are evident in the TC-2\ndata, despite the latitude of its footpoint not being signifi-\ncantly higher than that of Cluster, though it should be noted\nhere that the accuracy of T96 magnetic field mapping, par-\nticularly during more geomagnetically disturbed periods, is\nnot sufficient to precisely determine spacecraft footpoints.\nThe depleted flux tube can be identified as a small, transient,\ndipolarisation in the field at 14:02:20 UT (Fig. 9, panel b),\naccompanied by an increase in antiparallel (i.e. earthward),\nelectron flux (Fig. 9, panel g). This electron flux could either\nrepresent a field-aligned current or a simple parallel flow,\ndepending on the motion of the ions relative to that of the\nelectrons. There is very little rotation in the magnetic field\n(Fig. 9, panel d) when compared with the lower energy elec-\ntron beam detected at 14:03:40 UT so it can be assumed that\nthe flux enhancement does not contribute significantly to any\nfield-aligned current. There is also an enhancement of per-\npendicular electron flux (Fig. 9, panel f) during the transient\ndipolarisation, accompanied by a short dip in |dB| (Fig. 9,\npanel c) \u2013 consistent with the increase in plasma pressure and\ndecrease in magnetic pressure expected from the simulations.\nUnfortunately no velocity data, which could strengthen the\nassociation between the features seen by Cluster and TC-2,\nis available from TC-2 during this event.\n3.3 The effect of BY>0\nThe presence of a positive BY in the magnetotail will un-\ndoubtedly have an effect on the properties and motion of a\nplasma bubble, for example the change in the direction of the\nmagnetic field draping around its edges. The presence of a\nstrong BY in the magnetosphere, and the IMF, will also have\nan effect on the convection in the ionosphere (Cowley and\nLockwood, 1992), and therefore the motion of the footpoint\nof the depleted flux tube. The SuperDARN data described in\nFig. 3 do indeed show a convection pattern consistent with\nthose expected in a BY dominated magnetosphere (e.g. Gro-\ncott et al., 2003). The footpoint of the depleted flux tube\nis expected to be moving equatorwards because of the earth-\nwards motion of the plasma bubble in the tail and, because of\nthe BY -dominated magnetosphere, is also expected to have a\nduskward component to its motion, consistent with the Su-\nperDARN data (Fig. 3). Figure 17 illustrates the expected\ncurrent systems in the case of no BY and the case reported\nhere.\nIn the case of BY=0 (Fig. 17a), the cross-tail current is di-\nverted into the ionosphere via field-aligned currents at the\nedges of the depleted flux tube. The flux tube is moving\nearthward in the tail, so its footpoint is moving towards the\nequator. The direction of velocity is then consistent with the\ndirections of the magnetic field, B; current, j and electric\nfield, E in both the ionosphere and magnetotail.\nIf there is a duskward component to the velocity of the\nfoot point of the depleted flux tube in the ionosphere, assum-\ning the electric field is a convection electric field this will\nhave the effect of rotating the electric field vector from a\npurely dawn-dusk direction. A rotation in the electric field\nvector might also cause a rotation in j , since the ionosphere\nis dissipative (i.e. j \u00b7E>0) and therefore a current would fol-\nlow the electric field direction. This would have the effect of\nshifting the distribution of field-aligned currents at the edges\nof the flux tube equatorward in the ionosphere (and therefore\nearthward in the magnetotail) on the dawnward edge of the\nflux tube and poleward (tailward) in the ionosphere (mag-\nnetotail) on the duskward edge of the flux tube, which in\nturn might cause a rotation in the current and electric field\nacross the depleted flux tube, imparting a duskward com-\nponent of motion to the bubble in the tail (Fig. 17b). Al-\nthough a simple one-to-one mapping of the bubble electric\nfield into the ionosphere may not always be appropriate (e.g.\nAmm and Kauristie, 2002), the duskward direction of V\u22a5Y\nAnn.

The apparent flow\nshear across the tail neutral sheet within the plasma bubble\n(V\u22a5Y>0 in the south, V\u22a5Y<0 in the north; Fig. 5, panels a\nand b), and enhanced duskward convection in the southern\nionosphere (Fig. 3) suggest a situation analogous to the so-\ncalled TRINNI events that have been observed in the Su-\nperDARN and Cluster data (e.g. Grocott et al., 2005, Gro-\ncott et al., 2007). During these events, which have been\nobserved in periods of BY -dominated, but northward IMF,\nreconnection in a twisted tail and the subsequent untwist-\ning of the newly reconnected flux tubes result in flow shears\nacross the tail neutral sheet, and between the northern and\nsouthern ionospheres. This event occurred during a period\nof southward IMF, but the auroral data (Fig. 2) seem to in-\ndicate that the plasma bubble was unrelated to the substorm\nwith onset at \u223c02:00 MLT and \u223c14:05 UT and instead asso-\nciated with the more localised auroral activation in the mid-\nnight MLT sector a few minutes earlier. In this case there is\nno SuperDARN coverage at relevant MLTs in the Northern\nHemisphere, so analysis of further events is necessary to de-\ntermine whether or not the flow shear observed in tail here\nis TRINNI-like, or if the directions of V\u22a5Y observed by the\ndifferent spacecraft are related to flow patterns within a de-\npleted flux tube and internal to it.\n4 Summary and conclusions\nMultipoint observations of a depleted flux tube have been\nmade using the Cluster and Double Star TC-2 spacecraft that\nare broadly consistent with previous observations (Sergeev\net al., 1996, Forsyth et al., 2008, and references therein)\nand MHD simulations (Birn et al., 2004). In particular the\nfirst direct observations of the expected return flows around\nthe flanks of a plasma bubble, made simultaneously with\nthe observations of the bubble itself, have been reported; as\nhave the first observations of near-Earth (i.e. within 8RE)\nplasma bubble features predicted by simulations (Birn et al.,\n2004), such as an increase in plasma pressure and decrease in\nmagnetic pressure, accompanied by earthward, field-aligned,\nplasma flows detected by PEACE. Although no ion data are\navailable from TC-2, ion flow in the same direction is ex-\npected here because of the lack of rotation in the magnetic\nfield when the electrons were detected, implying that these\nelectrons were not carrying significant current. This particu-\nlar plasma bubble seemed to have associated with it a com-\nplex wake of lower plasma content than its surroundings, that\nwas not predicted by simulations.
