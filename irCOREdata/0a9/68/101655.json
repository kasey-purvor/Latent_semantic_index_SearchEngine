It identifies five concepts and outlines how they might be \nemployed to enable researchers explore  the complex social circumstances and \nhuman interactions that influence policy.   It considers the philosophical implications \nof social applications of complexity suggesting a move away from concerns about \nlinear process, universal modelling and tangible outputs of policy (such as a plan) \nand  towards localised and deeper studies to explore the dynamics of the enactment \nof policy within its context. It suggests that complexity theory might be used as a \nthinking tool to enable a more holistic approach to policy analysis which can \ninvestigate policy in its context, the interactions that exist between different policies \nand programmes, and the implications of human agency.   \n \nKey words: complexity theory, social science, tourism policy, \n \n \nIntroduction  \n \nChaos and complexity theories have been used in the study of tourism phenomena, \nparticularly incidents and aspects of which are perceived to be chaotic.  They have \nalso been used to challenge models and methods that conceptualise phenomena in \na simplified, linear manner, claiming that this ignores both the complexity and \ndynamism of those phenomena and the environments within which they operate.   \n \nThis paper investigates the potential contribution of debates about complexity theory \nin the wider management, policy and organisational literature to enhance \n 2 \nunderstanding of tourism policy making.  It is developed from a social \nconceptualisation of tourism policy, recognising its societal context and the role of \npeople negotiating and communicating to develop and implement policy.  Five \ncomplexity concepts are identified that might be used as a foundation from which to \nbuild research into tourism policy  taking account of the complex social \ncircumstances and human interactions that influence policy.  These concepts are \nrepresented here as they arose during research into tourism policy making in the \nU.K. which focussed on actors perspectives of (\u2026..2006).   \n \nThe implications of complexity in a social sphere are considered and approaches are \nsuggested to enable policy analysts to deepen their understanding of the social \naspects of the policy process by developing studies that recognise both complexity \nand social context.  The intention of this paper is to identify the complexity of \ncomplexity science and explore debates about how its concepts might be used to \ndevelop understanding of tourism policy making taking into account its context, \ndynamics and relationships.  It  intends to add to the existing literature on complexity \nand contribute to the debates about the use of complexity theory to develop \nunderstanding of tourism policy.   \n \nTheoretical Framework  \n \nChaos theory  \n \nMuch of the tourism literature on complexity draws from chaos theory and looks at \nthe chaotic parts of systems.  Chaos theory provides explanations of unexpected and \nunanticipated outcomes and points to the impossibility of long-term prediction.  The \nprinciples of chaos have been explored in various fields and have been found to \napply in meteorology, physics, chemistry and biology (Gleik, 1988; cited in Stacey, \n 3 \n2003).  Much of the early work on chaos within complex adaptive systems that \ninforms complexity theory was based upon occurrences within the natural \nenvironment and was framed by research by biologists and ecologists.  More recently \neconomists, social and political scientists have started to develop and adapt chaos \ntheory as a way of understanding human systems.  Specifically, Faulkner (2001) \nFaulkner & Russell (1997, 2001), McKercher (1999), Ritchie et al (2003) and Russell \n& Faulkner (1999) have considered chaos theory as a way of understanding the \ncomplexity of phenomena associated with tourism.  McKercher (1999) develops a \nchaos model that highlights the variety of interrelationships between nine different \nelements in \u201cthe tourism process\u201d.   Russell & Faulkner (1999) investigate the role of \nchaos makers in destination development.  Chaos theory has been used to underpin \nsome research into crises and disasters (including Miller & Ritchie, 2003).    \n \nChaos and complexity theory are often discussed in a manner that suggests they are \ninterchangeable and identical, however Byrne (2001), Haynes (2001) Harvey (2001) \nMitleton-Kelly (1998) and Stacey (2003) claim they are not the same. Haynes (2001) \ncontends that complexity theory has developed from, and uses the language of, \nchaos but has adopted different methods of research.  Mitleton-Kelly (1998) claims \nthey \u201cmay share certain characteristics but differ in so far as a complex adaptive \nsystem is able to evolve and to change\u201d (1998:6).   \n \nHarvey (2001) contrasts complexity theory, as advocated by Gell Mann (1994), Lewin \n(1993) and Waldrop (1992), and chaos theory as advocated by Prigogine and \nStengers (1984, 1997) and the Brussels Group.  He claims that complexity theory is \nfocussed on the \u201cinternal sub-system of complex systems while chaos theory\u201d studies \n\u201c\u2026the external system of complex systems\u201d (2001:3). Stacey (2003) contrasts the \napproaches adopted by chaos and complexity theorists claiming that the former are \n 4 \noften looking for an overall \u2018blueprint\u2019 for the whole system whilst the latter are more \nlikely to model agent interaction at the local level. \n \nComplexity theory \n \nIt is not possible to identify one complexity theory because different approaches have \nbeen developed across different disciplinary fields as researchers have sought to \nunderstand various aspects of diverse systems within complex environments \n(Mitleton-Kelly, 1998; Medd, 2001a).   Complexity theory has been developed across \ndisciplines, initially natural sciences (e.g. Prigogine and Stengers, 1984), physics  \n(e.g. Gell Mann, 1994), biology (e.g. Goodwin, 1997), computer science  (e.g.Traub \nand Werschultz, 1998) and economics (e.g. Brian Arthur, 1997), and more recently \neducation (e.g. Tosey ,2002),  management (e.g. Stacey,2003), spatial planning (e.g. \nHealey, 2007) and social policy (e.g. Harvey, 2001, Haynes 2001) and has involved \nsharing and borrowing ideas from those disciplines.  Research by Medd, 2001a, \nStacey (2003) and Healey (2007) indicates that there is a growing gap between \nnatural and social science in terms of understanding complexity, and debate about \nmodelling complex interaction in social or human systems.    \n   \nThe application and contribution of complexity theory to tourism phenomena \n \nResearchers including Farrell & Twining-Ward (2004), Faulkner & Russell (1997), \nMcKercher (1999), Russell & Faulkner (1999, 2004), Twining-Ward (2002), and \nZahra & Ryan (2007) have investigated complexity theory as a way of understanding \ntourism phenomena.  They criticise existing tourism models for their selectivity and \nfocus on stability or orderly linear change rather than complexity and turbulence in \nsystems.  Russell & Faulkner (1999) are critical that research has focussed on \n\u201cphenomena that exhibit order, linearity and equilibrium\u201d (1999:411). Faulkner & \n 5 \nRussell (1997), McKercher (1999) and Russell & Faulkner (1999, 2004) use ideas \nfrom complexity and chaos theory to critique models of that simplify phenomena in \norder to identify key parts and then assume linear relationships between those parts.   \n \nMcKercher (1999) contends that tourism is characterised by a complex range of \ninteractions and that its dynamics are chaotic non-linear and unstable.  He draws \nfrom the work of Lewin (1993) demonstrating that large, interactive, dynamic systems \nevolve naturally towards the edge of chaos.  The implication for tourism phenomena \nis that they can appear to evolve in a stable, predictable and linear manner over long \nperiods of time, until a trigger initiates a period of chaotic upheaval where non-linear \nrelationships dominate.  The dominance of \u2018Newtonian\u2019 and rational approaches in \ntourism means that knowledge is well developed in some selected parts of the \ntourism system but that there is little knowledge of the relationships and interactions \nbetween these parts (Farrell & Twining-Ward, 2004). \n \nFarrell & Twining-Ward (2004) identify the problem that  \n \n\u201c\u2026researchers schooled in a tradition of linear, specialised, predictable, \ndeterministic, cause-and-effect science, are working in an area of study that is \nlargely nonlinear, integrative, generally unpredictable, qualitative and \ncharacterised by causes giving rise to multiple outcomes, quite out of \nproportion to the initial input\u201d (2004:277). \n \nThe literature identified above draws from the ideas developed in the physical\/natural \nsciences rather than the social sciences (the latter can be found in the wider \norganisational and public policy literature including Fonseca (2002), Stacey (2003), \nand Shaw (2002)). Complexity is presented in terms of the challenges it presents to \nlinear thinking and determinism.  Researchers debate the extent to which complexity \n 6 \ntheory surmounts or surpasses existing approaches with Farrell & Twining-Ward \n(2004) suggesting a paradigm shift and Faulkner (2003) advocating  a more cautious \n\u201cdiversification of perspectives\u201d (2003:216) rather than a paradigm shift.   \n \nThe contribution of complexity theory in developing understanding of tourism \nphenomena is significant but limited.   Its significance arises from its role in \nidentifying the complex and dynamic nature of tourism phenomena and questioning \ntheory that is underpinned by notions of stability, linear relationships and \npredictability.  Discussion about the implications of complexity has provided an \nopportunity for researchers to re-examine the interconnected nature of tourism \nphenomena and to develop methods and models that attempt to encompass multiple \nrelationships, turbulanceand change.   \n \nThe main limitations of the applications of complexity theory to tourism phenomena \nare that they have been applied to a comparatively narrow range of issues by \nrelatively few researchers.  These studies are largely underpinned by ideas \ndeveloped by physical\/natural sciences and are predominantly grouped around \nchaotic events or crises management (McKercher, 1999; Miller & Ritchie, 2003; \nRitchie et al, 2003) the roles, power and tensions between groups in the policy \nmaking process(Tyler & Dinan, 2001; Zahra and Ryan, 2007) and destination \ndevelopment (Russell & Faulkner, 1999), and as a way of progressing sustainability \nresearch (Farrell & Twining-Ward, 2004; and Twining-Ward 2002).   While it is \npossible to find references to complexity concepts in emerging wider policy research \n(for example the research on network theory by Bramwell (2006)) it is often difficult to \nascertain the sources, boundaries and assumptions that underlie these concepts.  It \ntherefore seems an appropriate time to review the debates about complexity theory \nin the wider policy literature to enable reflection upon the opportunities and insights \nthat might be offered to policy studies.  \n 7 \n \nThe abovementioned studies do not investigate the complexity of complexity science \nand with the exception of Zahra and Ryan (2007); they do not articulate which \nparticular approach to chaos or complexity they have adopted.  A review of the \nliterature indicates that Russell & Faulkner (1999) and Twining-Ward (2002) have \nadopted biological and ecological definitions of chaos and complexity and their ideas \nappear to draw from the work of Prigogine & Stengers (1984, 1997) and the Brussels \nGroup.  There is much less discussion about the work of researchers from a range of \ndisciplines from the Sante Fe Institute, who have developed mathematical and \nscientific approaches to model social phenomena  (including Gell Man, 1994 and \nWaldrop, 1992) and no explicit discussion of the wider debates arising in \nmanagement and public policy literature around complexity.  \n \nChaos theory underpins research into both chaos and complexity and has usually \nbeen applied to the turbulent or chaotic parts of tourism systems.   An example of this \nis a model developed by Russell & Faulkner (1999) suggesting polarity between the \ninclinations of entrepreneurs and planner\/policy makers associating the former with \nintuitive, innovative, experimental inclinations which are perceived to be essentially \nchaotic in nature.  Policy makers\u2019 are characterised as controlling, rational and risk \naverse and as a stable part of the tourism system \u201cestablishing a \u2018Newtonian\u2019 regime \nof equilibrium and linear change\u201d (1999:417).  This dichotomous thinking is \nreductionist as it overstates the differences between different groups of people and \nunderplays their interactions.  It ignores the relevance of complexity theory to \nunderstanding detailed social interactions involved in policy making.  \n   \nIt appears that tourism research has drawn heavily from scientific approaches and \n\u201ctraditional\u201d chaos and complexity theory.  The next section this paper will consider \nthe  contribution of social scientists and policy analysts to complexity theory and \n 8 \ndiscuss the debates about modelling complex social phenomena .  It will consider \nmore nuanced approaches arising from questions about whether, and how it is \npossible to apply complexity concepts to human or social phenomena and how to \nstudy complexity taking account of all its complexity.    \n \nWider applications of complexity theory to develop understanding of social \nphenomena   \n \nAn important contribution of policy researchers including Medd (2001), Byrne (2001) \nand Harvey (2001) is the questions they raise about complexity science as an \nalternative way of seeing the world and transforming understanding of social \nphenomena.   Medd (2001a) claims this \u201cextreme position\u201d is underpinned by an \nassumption that complexity science offers a coherent and ordered body of \nknowledge that is superior to other positions.  The problem with this discourse is that \nit identifies complexity not as a \u201cway of looking at the world to be compared with \nother possibilities, but the way of the world\u201d (Medd, 2001a:2). This focuses attention \naway from the broader potential contribution of using complexity concepts to explore \npossibilities for understanding the social world and towards what is claimed to be a \nbetter conceptualisation of the world. \n \n \nPolicy and organisational theorists including Fonseca (2002),  Medd (2001a&b), \nShaw (2002) and Stacey (2003) explore the philosophical implications of complexity \nand the methods that can be used to research complex phenomena in the social \nsphere.  They are critical of research that attempts to make direct translations of \ncomplexity concepts to the human sphere arguing for looser, nuanced and more \nreflective approaches.  They argue against the direct importation of scientific \n 9 \napproaches to modelling complex social phenomena and develop narratives as a \nway of investigating complexity within organisations.  \n \nThey also discuss  the extent to which policy making is a \u201csoft\u201d intuitive human \nprocess.  Human interactions play a key role in the process that is typified by \ncontinuous communicative interactions between people.  Interactions are formal and \ninformal, cross official boundaries, between teams, departments, organisations and \noften cross boundaries between \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cleisure\u201d.  The interaction and negotiation \ninvolved in developing and implementing policy is wide ranging, including people with \ndifferent values and experiences from a range of organisations.   \n \nThe complexity and unpredictability of human behaviour raises questions about how \nand whether complex adaptive systems fully encompass human agency and action.  \nHaynes (2001) questions those complex adaptive systems models that assume \nhumans are generally passive and conditioned by the rules and their environment, \nclaiming that humans are capable of producing new rules and choosing whether or \nnot to apply them. In policy research it is important to acknowledge that humans are \ncomplex so they are \u201csocially determined, productions of historically situated social \nstructures\u201d (Harvey 2001:8) but also are \u201cfree-agents\u201d who exhibit unpredictable \nbehaviour.  Human behaviour creates an additional layer of complexity to the policy \nprocess. \n \nIs it possible to model complexity in the social world? \n \nIn order to apply complexity metaphors to the social sphere it is necessary to make \nassumptions about the policy system, the relevant policy makers and their \nrelationships.  Medd (2001a&b) demonstrates the subjectivity involved in this process \nby illustrating three episodes from an ethnographic study.  The episodes illustrate \n 10 \nconnections and collaborations between different people from different organisations \ninvolved in the development and delivery of the project.  Each episode is connected \nbecause they all relate to one project, but they are disconnected, because they occur \nin different times and places with different outcomes, and are enacted through \ndifferent people with diverse motivations.  His three episodes illustrate the extent to \nwhich the researcher makes decisions based upon a-prioi assumptions about the \nsystem and illustrates that a complexity model of this system \u201cwould have to be as \ncomplex as the system itself\u201d (2001b:4).   The connections made by the researcher \nhave implications for what is deemed relevant to the policy and what is studied, and \nillustrates the need for researchers to acknowledge and evaluate their position and \nlikely bias.   \n \nStacey (2003) argues that as participants in interactions in the social world, humans \ncannot analyse that world in an objective and value free way.  Fonseca (2002), \nMitleton-Kelly (1998), Shaw (2002), Stacey (2003) and Tsoukas & Hatch (2001) \nreject model building as a way of seeking to understand complex phenomena in \nsociety. They draw attention to the fundamental distinction between human and other \ncomplex systems, based on the assumption that humans are able to make choices \nand as a result their behaviour is complex.  They claim that modelling involves \nsimplification of complex phenomena and is based upon the mistaken assumption \nthat the researcher can analyse the world in an objective free way.  Straightforward \napproaches to modelling connections between different elements in the system are \nlikely to be reductionist and deterministic reflecting the personal experiences or \nunderstanding of the researcher. \n \nThe discussion presented in this section suggests that traditional modelling might not \nbe an appropriate tool when researching complex social phenomena such as policy \nmaking.  Medd (2001b) show how complex systems models tell a specific story, \n 11 \nbased upon the assumptions adopted by the researcher.  These assumptions lead \nthem to focus on particular issues and limits understanding of the process.  \n \nDeveloping exploratory approaches to improve understanding of complex \nsocial phenomena   \n \nVan Uden (2005) suggests  \u201cloose\u201d applications of complexity theory might be \nappropriate as a way of developing understanding of social phenomena.   \nResearchers including Fonseca (2002), Haynes (2001), Sanderson (2000), Shaw \n(2002), Stacey (2003) and Tsoukas & Hatch (2001) contend that complexity requires \nmethods which are more exploratory than explanatory.  They challenge the simple \nimportation of complexity concepts into the human realm using conventional systems \nthinking and suggest that an alternative approach might be to tap complexity as a \nway of investigating the relationships involved in the complex responsive processes \nin society. They focus on the importance of human interaction and communication in \nthe construction of \u201cevery day reality\u201d and develop ideas about reflexivity and \nunderstanding through participation.  \nMedd (2001a&b) and Harvey (2001) draw attention to the pitfalls of a simple or literal \ntranslation of complexity to explain human activities.  Medd (2001b) argues that \ncomplexity models carry assumptions that affect understanding of policy dynamics.  \nIn particular he identifies limitations of traditional or mainstream complexity models in \nterms of their reductionist and deterministic assumptions.  Fonseca (2002), Stacey \n(2003) and Shaw (2002) echo these concerns and have developed alternative \napproaches.   They have developed research that reflects the importance of \ncommunication, conversations and story telling in organisations supported by \nnarratives as a way of demonstrating relationships and developing knowledge about \nthe dynamics of change in the human sphere. \n \n 12 \nThe discussion outlined above suggests complexity theory should be developed as a \nway to encourage thought and learning as a \u201cframe of reference \u2013 a way of \nunderstanding what things are like, how they work, and how they might be made to \nwork\u201d (Byrne, 2001:7)  It should not be applied literally, as a set of rules, methods \nand models when it is used to understand social phenomena or human systems.   \n \nFive key concepts and their relevance to understanding tourism policy  \n \nThis section investigates some of the debates and applications of complexity theory \nin the social sciences, focussing on five concepts, to help define and explain ideas \nabout phenomena and dynamics in that occur in complex policy environments.  It \ndraws from research by Blackman, 2001; Byrne 2001, Fonseca, 2002; Harvey, 2001; \nMedd, 2001 a,b; Stacey, 2003; Shaw, 2002 and Tsoukas & Hatch, 2001 and \ninvestigates their relevance to understanding tourism policy within its social and \nrelational context.  This is not intended to be exhaustive  but intends to bring social \nand management perspectives about complexity into the literature.  The list has been \nframed in the context of research into policy making at the destination level in the \nU.K. (\u2026\u2026.., 2006) \n \n1. Complex adaptive systems  \n \nComplexity theory seeks to understand changes in complex adaptive systems. The \nterm complex is used to describe a system in which interaction is detailed, and where \nagents (people) make choices about their individual actions.  A complex system is \nadaptive because it influences and is influenced by its environment (Brian Arthur et \nal., 1997; Harvey, 2001).  In the policy sphere the complex adaptive system consists \nof a large number of people, working within organisations, each behaving according \nto a set of rules or principles that require them to interact and negotiate with other \n 13 \npeople.  Their actions are constrained by conventions and rules and by access to \nresources.  They are shaped by official hierarchical relationships and informal \nworking relationships which are affected by a range of intangible and human factors.  \nIn this context the idea of a complex adaptive system can be used to draw attention \nto the way that people within systems provide opportunities and are constrained by \nlinkages to each other.   \n \nThe notion of a complex adaptive system is useful for understanding the specific \ncontext within which policies are made.  For example in a destination where tourism \npolicy is explicitly defined as a part of economic policy, actions will be framed and \narticulated within an economic context.  This will constrain its nature, but will not be \nthe only constraint as tourism policy intersects with other policy areas such as \ntransport, environment, culture and leisure which also offer opportunities and create \nconstraints.  The relationship will also be affected by the position of tourism in the \npolicy hierarchy of any given destination, access to resources and the ability of \ntourism policy makers to influence a wide group of people in partnership \norganisations.   These multiple and cross cutting linkages or relationships result in \nbehaviour within the policy system that is both \u2018patterned\u2019 and \u2018unpredictable\u2019 \n(Battram, 1998; Stacey, 2003).  While it is possible to identify the key relationships \nbetween policy arenas (e.g. tourism, economics, transport, environment) the \nrelationships between these arenas and between the policy makers within them are \nall constantly changing.    \n \nTourism policy systems are \u201cnested\u201d within an environment comprised of other \ncomplex systems.  The boundaries between these systems are not discrete and \nByrne (2001) identifies  \u201cnested inter-penetrating systems\u201d which intersect and \ninteract, with influence flowing in many directions, across hierarchies and structural \nboundaries as policy is developed and enacted.  The interactions between people in \n 14 \nthese different systems are constantly evolving, and change is intense due to \ndevelopments in the wider policy environment such as the transition from \ngovernment towards \u2018governance\u2019 with new structures and practices to deliver \u2018joined \nup\u2019 policy across organisational boundaries (Sanderson, 2000; Healey, 2007).  Policy \nis made in a context that is characterised by change and instability so it makes little \nsense to conceptualise policy systems within a stable context or to develop models \nwhich are based upon a notion of \u201cequilibrium\u201d. \n \n2. Emergence  \n \nEmergence is a characteristic of a complex adaptive system arising through the \ninnovation and learning that occurs as the internal structure of systems evolves and \nchanges (Battram, 1998; Manson, 2001).  It is a \u2018bottom up\u2019 process arising when the \ncollective behaviour of interacting individuals results in a system or part of a system \nadapting and creating an emergent order (Stacey, 2003).  In a policy system, \nemergence draws attentions to the way that allegiances and groupings emerge within \npartnership organisations, and across political groupings, the way that people outside \nthe formal system lobby and influence powerful decision makers.   \n \n\u2026\u2026..(2008) identifies the emergent qualities of tourism policy making in Leeds \nbetween 1977-2007, highlighting its fluidity as it evolves and regresses, and connects \nwith a variety of more mainstream policy areas.  Over this time it develops from \ninformal to formal policy and its progress onto the policy agenda demonstrates a \nmixture of learning and opportunism as alliances are formed by policy makers.    \n \nEmergence draws attention towards the importance of human action in developing \nand delivering policy.  \u2026\u2026. (2008) demonstrates how significant shifts in tourism \npolicy making in a destination can be precipitated by the actions of one person.  The \nsignificance of individual policy makers vary over time as tourism policy emerges and \n 15 \ndeclines.  Tourism policy makers demonstrate successive shifts between power and \npowerlessness as they form alliances to develop and enact policy.   \n \nEmergence draws attention to the idea that it may not be possible to predict  the \nbehaviour of a system from knowledge of what each component of a system does in \nisolation.  It leads to the situation where the capacity of a complex system is greater \nthan the sum of the constituent parts (Battram, 1998; Manson, 2001; Stacey, 2003; \nWaldrop, 1992 ;) or \u201csomehow different from its parts\u201d (Urry 2003:24). The \nimplications of emergence on policy making within a complex environment, \ncharacterised by partnership working and change, are that changes in complex \nadaptive systems may be too complex for people to control. Emergence challenges \npeople to acknowledge that they can influence rather than control action within a \ncomplex environment (Tosey, 2002).   It highlights the need for exploratory \napproaches focussed not just on an understanding of the system and its interaction \nwith other systems but to consider the interactions of individuals and groups of policy \nmakers to investigate the complex and contradictory dynamics that arise.   \n \n3. The edge of chaos  \n \nThe edge of chaos, (Battram, 1998; Tosey, 2002), is also termed the zone of \ncomplexity, (Stacey et al, 2000) or bounded instability (Mitleton-Kelly, 1998) and \ndescribes the transition phase in a complex system where ordered behaviour co-\nexists with disordered or turbulent behaviour (Battram, 1998; Mitleton-Kelly, 1998).  It \noccupies the area between order and chaos, and is a place of intense learning, \ninnovation and creativity (Battram, 1998; Tosey, 2002), the point of maximum fitness, \nor maximum evolveability (Lewin, 1993).  At the edge of chaos changes can occur \neasily and spontaneously as the system breaks with the past (Stacey et al, 2000; \nBattram, 1998) and new systems of order emerge from and alongside the disorder \n 16 \n(Mitleton-Kelly 1998).  Forces, such as emergence, push organisations or systems \ntowards the edge of chaos (Battram, 1998 and Manson, 2001).  \n \nBattram (1998) Mitleton-Kelly (1998) and Stacey (2003) identify the paradoxical \ndynamic at the edge of chaos where apparently conflicting elements appear to be \noperating at the same time.  In terms of understanding policy dynamics the edge of \nchaos challenges some of the traditional assumptions about policy making such as  \nthe idea that for success contradictions and paradoxes must be resolved and the \ntension that they cause, relaxed.   While this traditional approach equates success \nwith dynamics of stability, regularity and predictability, the edge of chaos opens up \nthe possibility that contradictions and paradoxes can never be resolved.  It highlights \nthe dynamics of policy making and action in terms of continuing tension that \ngenerates patterns that are irregular, unstable and unpredictable.   \n \nSeveral writers have considered the type of decision making that takes place at the \nedge of chaos and draw attention to what Zimmerman (2001) calls \u2018garbage can \ndecision making\u2019 which is intuitive, is characterised by muddling through, agenda \nbuilding, brainstorming and dialectical enquiry.  She contrasts it with the traditional \nmanagement approaches required in an environment which is relatively stable and \nconsensual.  Darwin (2001) identifies the traditional \u201ctoolkit\u201d of methods for decision \nmaking in a stable environment, including techniques such as SWOT, PEST(EL), five \nforces analysis and stakeholder analysis.  He claims that these methods underplay \n\u2018backstage activity\u2019, including power and politics. Darwin\u2019s (2001) research does not \nspecifically relate to tourism policy making but the methods he associates with linear \nthinking and stability are commonly recommended in policymaking texts (including \nGunn, 2002; and Veal, 2002 ).   \n \n 17 \nThe edge of chaos is particularly useful in developing an understanding of policy \nmaking in the context of the changes associated with governance.  Governance is \ncharacterised by the changing role of government and the emergence of new \nstructures, agencies and processes.  In particular there has been a focus on \nengendering more collaboration and partnership working (Richards and Smith 2002; \nStoker 2004; Stoker and Wilson 2004).  These changes have led to an intense period \nof policy making, a range of sometimes contradictory initiatives and context that is \nturbulent and complex (Healey, 2007).  They have also led to policy makers moving \naway from traditional approaches to policy making and developing new exploratory \nand experimental approaches which involve more collaboration.   \n \n4. Positive and negative feedback  \n \nMitleton-Kelly (1998) claims policy and planning systems that are developed within \nequilibrium frameworks are based on the assumption of negative feedback.  Negative \nfeedback is \u201cthe process required to produce the dynamics of stability\u201d (Stacey, \n2003:33), with the assumption that links between cause and effect are clear-cut.  For \nexample the policy process models discussed by Gunn (2002) and Veal (2002) are \nbased upon the assumption of negative feedback.  They indicate a process which \nincludes an explicit monitoring stage where the role of the policy maker is to take \naction to reduce the gap between the intended and actual outcome.  \n \nPositive feedback is the term given to the progressive widening of the gap between \nthe required and the actual results (Mitleton-Kelly, 1998; Sanderson, 2000; Stacey, \n2003; Urry 2003).  Positive feedback loops \u201ccan exacerbate initial stresses in the \nsystem and render it unable to absorb shocks to re-establish the original equilibrium\u201d \n(Urry, 2003:11)The discussion around negative and positive feedback in social \nsystems highlights how a policy response to a multifaceted problem in a complex \n 18 \nenvironment can be successful at one level and unsuccessful at another.  For \nexample a destination that is perceived to offer low quality service standards may \nadopt a policy to develop a service training programme to improve the skills of its \nworkers.  This may result in 100 people being trained and at one level be perceived \nto be a success.  However if those 100 people then use their training to gain better \nemployment in other destinations, or in other sectors, the overall outcome of that \npolicy intervention may lead to service standards dropping further.  In this case the \nconcept of positive feedback draws attention to the implications of a range of \ncomplex interrelationships, movements and interactions within a system and its \nenvironment where a policy intervention amplifies the problems it is intending to \nresolve.  \n \n5. The policy landscape   \n \nSome complexity theorists describe the environment outside a given system as the \nlandscape (Battram, 1998; Blackman, 2001) and claim that its characteristics affect \nthe dynamic and nature of change.  Healey (2007) highlights the need to \u201cread\u201d \nlandscapes to ascertain their dimensions and qualities.  In respect of tourism policy, \nreading the landscape would involve developing an understanding of the wider policy \nand political context of policy making, about the scope, nature and purpose of \ntourism policy making, and about its intersections and relationships with other policy \nareas. \n \nBlackman (2001) identifies a rugged landscape as one where autonomous action is \nstifled and claims that this ruggedness reduces the likelihood of transformative \nchange within complex systems.  The wider policy environment in the U.K. provides \nan example of a rugged landscape and arises from the tensions between \u2018Third Way\u2019 \nideology (Giddens, 1998) governance and the modernisation agenda.  Richards & \n 19 \nSmith (2002) claim that the fragmentation associated with governance has led \nnational government to introduce centralised control to measure and standardise \npolicy provision at the local level.  The local policy environment is therefore extremely \nrugged and policy makers have limited scope for autonomous action.    However \n\u2026..\u2026. (2006) indicates that in the U.K. the policy landscape for tourism might be less \nrugged than other policy areas as  tourism policy is discretionary, devolved to the \nregions and is not monitored by nationally set targets.  While tourism policy at the \ndestination level is \u201cembedded\u201d in a rugged wider policy landscape, the implications \nof this ruggedness are indirect and apply where tourism policy intersects with other \npolicy areas.    \n \nThe concept of landscape is interesting for tourism policy analysts not just because it \ndraws attention to the extent that policy interventions are always embedded within \ntheir wider environment but also because it enables them to identify and investigate \nsome of the contradictory dynamics in the wider environment.   \n \nUsing complexity theory to develop understanding of tourism policy making   \n \nComplexity theory is informed by, and is being debated within many disciplines and is \nrelevant to the study of tourism policy as it acknowledges its inherent intricacies .  \nThe complexity of tourism policy is exacerbated by the lack of agreement about its \nnature and purpose, its multi-disciplinary roots and diverse body of theory.  Theorists \ninterpret the policy \u2018problem\u2019 in different ways and have developed different models \nreflecting a variety of disciplinary perspectives.   \n \nThe literature on complexity theory present a plausible challenge to many \nassumptions that underpin the literature on tourism policy making.  In particular the \nchallenge to positivism, linear thinking and the notion that policies and plans can \n 20 \npredict, control and shape complex environments.  Complexity theory draws attention \naway from the relative order attributed to tourism policy making which is \ncharacterised by the development and enactment of written policies and is illustrated \nby process models (Gunn 2002 and Veal 2002), systems models (Gunn 2002, Hall \n2000).It enables us to consider the disorder arising from  interaction, competition and \nhuman agency on the policy process.     \n \nThe five concepts outlined in this paper draw attention to some of the complexities \nand contradictions arising in the development and enactment of tourism policy.  \nConsideration of complex adaptive systems encourages reflection on the nature and \ninterpenetration of tourism policy systems highlights the instability and turbulence of \nthose systems.   Emergence draws attention to human agency, \u201cbottom-up\u201d learning \nand innovation and their implications on our ability to predict.  The edge of chaos  \ncharacterised by the co-existence of order and disorder, stability and instability giving \nrise to contradiction and uncertainty.  This questions the relevance of policy tools that \nare developed from an equilibrium framework.  Positive feedback draws attention to \nthe way narrowly framed policy interventions might amplify problems and identifies \nthe need to consider the wider and longer term implications of policy.  Policy \nlandscape illustrates both the embeddness of policy and the contradictory dynamics \nthat exist in the wider environment. \n \nThe concepts identified from the complexity literature questions our ability to fully \nunderstand the policy process and to forecast, regulate and control the future. It \nhighlights the intrinsic relationship between policy research and ignorance and \nrequires a research approach that can encourage the researcher to be both humble \nin recognising their own limitations and courageous in resisting the orthodoxy to \nreduce and simplify.  \n \n 21 \nIn policy analysis, social approaches offer insights by drawing attention to the subtle \nintangible and contradictory aspects of the process such as the relationships and \nalliances that develop between people as they develop and enact policy.  They \nsuggest more localised and deeper studies to develop a more nuanced and \nexploratory approach to policy analysis.  They emphasize understanding of how \npolicies are implemented, how they generate effects over time, and how such effects \nare dependent on contextual circumstances, interactions and human agency \n(Sanderson 2000). \n \nThe debates identified from the social sciences suggest that complexity theory might \nbe used as a thinking tool to enable a more holistic approach to policy analysis.  \nThey focus  away from understanding the detail of the policy process and towards \ndeveloping an understanding of broader themes, patterns and principles that arise \nwhen developing policy in a complex and contested environment. They also focus  \naway from the tangible components of policy, such as a tourism strategy document \nand towards policy context and relationships.   \n \nComplexity theory challenges assumptions about research and analysis raising \nquestions about what we should try to understand and how we should try to \nunderstand.  Complexity science works on the assumption of non linearity, which \nimplies that knowledge is local and contextual.  This raises questions about the \nextent to which researchers can develop models that have meaning outside the local \ncontext.   It implies the rejection of those models that claim to be universal and that \nare reductionist, simplifying processes and systems in order to understand them.  \nResearch into social phenomena requires a research methodology that can \nencompass the inter-relationships, interactions and communications between people \ninvolved in developing and delivering policy.   \n 22 \n \nConclusion  \n \nComplexity concepts are the subject of debate in many disciplinary areas and are \nsubject to multiple interpretations.  In the same way that it is not possible to identify \none policy theory, it is not possible to identify one complexity theory as different \napproaches have been developed in different disciplinary fields.   Complexity theory \nis negotiated and open to varied interpretation, which presents a wide range of \npossibilities in exploring its implications on social phenomena such as tourism policy \nmaking.  \n \nComplexity theory does not provide a new \u2018truth\u2019 about the way the world works.  \nThe underlying concepts of complexity can be both deterministic and reductionist, \nlimiting learning in much the same way as traditional models about organisations and \npolicy making. Tsoukas & Hatch (2001) claim orthodox approaches to complexity \nexhibit the same reductionist tendencies as the Newtonian, linear models when they \nidentify the common principles underlying different systems.   \n \nSocial approaches to complexity highlight its role in encouraging researchers to \nquestion their assumptions,  broaden their thinking and strive towards a more holistic \nunderstanding of phenomena.  They explore the possibilities of \u2018loose\u2019 (Van Uden, \n2005), reflective (Harvey, 2001)or \u2018dis-connected\u2019 (Medd, 2001b) applications of \ncomplexity theory in the social sphere, demonstrating the benefits of bringing the \nconcepts and language of complexity into the study of social phenomena to provide a \nfocus for debate and discussion that might underpin a deeper understanding of those \nissues.   \n \n 23 \nThis paper intends to build on existing work in complexity theory, by drawing \nattention to the debates arising in the social sciences.  It identifies five concepts, \nemergence, complex adaptive systems, edge of chaos, positive feedback and \nlandscape and discusses how they might be used to develop  thinking about policy \nmaking.     It suggests exploratory approaches to enable consideration of the \nlandscapes in which policy decisions are made, the relationships, intersections and \nadaptations of tourism policy, the emergent nature and implications of human action, \nthe turbulence and dynamism of change at the edge of chaos and the positive \nfeedback arising from the complex relationships between cause and effect, as policy \nmakers seek to resolve problems. \n \nTo date the main contribution of complexity theory to understanding social \nphenomena in tourism has been the challenge to linear thinking and positivism and \nthe criticism of the emphasis of much research on the ordered, and more easily \ndefined aspects of systems.  This has progressed thinking at a conceptual level.  It is \nnow time to take that challenge further and to draw upon some of the wider debates \nabout the application of complexity to social phenomena and explicitly engage in \ndiscussion about its methodological implications.  Complexity theory has important \nimplications for policy research in cross cutting areas such as tourism.  The \ncontribution of a social perspective is that highlights the need for more holistic \nunderstanding of policy process and  raises questions about how we should analyse \npolicy interventions in a social world.   \n \nComplexity theory contributes to policy analysis due to the questions it raises about \nthe stability and equilibrium implicit in many policy process models.  It provides a \nbasis from which to consider policy in the context of \u2018real world\u2019 phenomena, taking \naccount of turbulence and disequilibrium, self organisation and co-evolution.  \nHighlighting the importance of communication, it provides new insights in \n 24 \nconceptualising the dynamic between policy and practice.  It raises questions about \nthe methods for researching complex social phenomena highlighting the nature of \nhuman communication and need for exploration rather than prediction.   \n \nThe debates outlined in this paper support the development of further research into \nthe characteristics of the tourism policy process, taking into account the turbulence \nand complexity of its environment.  Research need to be undertaken to focus on \nwhat tourism policy is, and what happens when tourism policy makers  develop and \nenact policies in different policy environments, and what the implications of tourism \npolicy are over longer time frames.  There is a need for the development of \nlongitudinal, case based research to improve the understanding of tourism policy \nmaking in its specific context from the perspective of the people involved and to \nbroaden understanding of policy as a social process involving collaboration and \nnegotiation.   \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nBattram,  A.
