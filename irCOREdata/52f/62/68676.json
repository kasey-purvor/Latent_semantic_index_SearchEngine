Where O2, NO3-, and Fe\/Mn oxyhydroxides become depleted within these \nmicroniches or where they exist in zones of sulfate reduction, significant localized peaks in \nsulfide concentration can occur. These discrete zones of sulfide evolution can cause \nformation of iron sulfides that would not be predicted by analysis of the bulk sediment. \nUsing a reaction-transport model developed specifically for investigating spherical \nmicroniches, and incorporating 3D diffusion, we investigated how the rate constants of \norganic matter (OM) degradation, particle porosity and niche lifetime, affect dissolved sulfide \nand iron concentrations, and formation of iron sulfide at such niches. For all of the modelled \nscenarios the saturation index for iron sulfide is positive, indicating favourable conditions for \nFeS precipitation in all niches. Those simulations within the microniche lifetime range of 2.5 \nto 5 days gave comparable concentration ratios of sulfide to iron in solution within the niche \nto experimentally observed values. Our model results provide insight into the mechanisms of \npreservation of OM, including soft tissue, in the paleo record, by predicting the conditions \nthat result in preferential deposition of precipitates at the edge of microniches. Decreases in \nporosity, shorter niche lifetimes and increases in OM degradation rate constants, all tend to \nincrease the likelihood that FeS precipitation will preferentially occur at the edges of a niche, \nrather than uniformly throughout the niche volume.  \n 3 \n1. INTRODUCTION  \nIn stable sediment where oxygen is present at the sediment water interface, bioturbation \ninfluences the sediment structure. Due to burrow formation, irrigation, feeding and associated \nprocesses, this influence often extends some way into the zone of the sediment usually \nconsidered anoxic. These processes create distributions of localized geochemical features \nassociated with active burrows (with surface connection), inactive and infilled burrows, and \nfaecal pellets, and facilitate translocation of surface deposited material, such as marine snow, \nto greater depths. Here we consider that microniches are formed when discrete particles of \nreactive organic matter are introduced at depth in the sediment. These microniches can be \nattributed to decaying organisms (observed using a pH optode; Zhu et al., 2006), algal \naggregates (added to sediment to study sulfidic microniches; Widerlund and Davison, 2007) \nand faecal pellets (photographed after resin embedding and thin sectioning of an intact core; \nWatling, 1988). The diameter of these microniches can in principle vary from a few microns \nup to the centimetre scale. However, using high-resolution probes their diameter has \ngenerally been observed in the range of 400 \u00b5m to ~1 cm (Stockdale et al., 2009; and \nreferences therein).  \nSignificant localized peaks in dissolved sulfide (here we use the term sulfide solely to refer to \nthe sum of the dissolved phases H2S, HS- and S2-) can occur where microniches become \ndepleted in O2, NO3-, and Fe\/Mn oxyhydroxides, or where they exist in zones of sulfate \nreduction. Localized elevated sulfide formed during the oxidation of microniches of highly \nreactive organic matter, may provide discrete environments where appreciably more iron \nsulfide forms than indicated from bulk measurements. With core slicing, for example, there is \ninherent averaging, and mixing of redox regimes may result in loss of localized sulfides via \n 4 \noxidation. If locally formed iron sulfides are not subsequently re-oxidized, microniches may \naccount for a significant proportion of FeS or FeS2 accumulation. Within the upper iron-\ndominated zone of marine sediments, localized pyrite is commonly associated with \nmicroniches of reactive OM (Raiswell, 1993).   \nGround breaking diagenetic models, presented by Aller (1980), Berner (1980), Boudreau \n(1996; and references therein) and van Cappellen and Wang (1996), amongst others, have \nadvanced understanding of sediment systems. With scant information from measurements, \nunderstanding of possible processes occurring in microniches has been advanced by \nmodelling. The pioneering study by J\u00f8rgensen (1977) investigated the conditions required for \na niche to become anoxic within oxic sediment. Raiswell et al. (1993) formulated a basic, 3D, \nthree-component model (Fe2+, sulfide and a pyrite precipitate), relating diffusion and \nprecipitation at the edge of spherical microniches of diameters 50 \u00b5m or more. The modelling \nshowed that a greater niche diameter or higher sulfate reduction rate, required increasingly \nhigher dissolved iron concentrations to constrain pyrite precipitation to the niche edge. The \ndiffusion all around niches that is modelled in 3D is not considered in 1D simulations. Multi \ncomponent modelling in 3D has revealed further complexity in microniche geochemistry. \nSochaczewski et al. (2008), showed that within a single microniche near the sediment \nsurface, there can be up to three discrete zones characterised by the dominance of different \noxidants (O2, NO3- and SO4-). It was assumed that there were no Fe or Mn oxides in the \nniche. Sulfide is produced because O2 and NO3- are readily consumed in the small volume of \nthe niche.   \nHere we have modelled, in 3D, the dynamics and spatial distribution of dissolved sulfide, \ndissolved iron and FeS within and in the vicinity of an idealised spherical particle in suboxic \n 5 \nsediment (below the oxygen and nitrate penetration depths). The modelling was undertaken \nwithout use of any fitting parameters so that any correlations to published experimentally \nobserved data are on an a priori basis. The main aim of this study was to examine how ranges \nof the microniche properties, porosity, OM degradation rate constant and microniche lifetime, \naffect dissolved sulfide, dissolved iron and FeS concentrations and the nature of FeS \nprecipitation. Further, we will discuss how the results are related to observations and \nhypotheses from previous studies.  \n2. MODELLING FRAMEWORK  \n2.1. Model Description  \nThe sediment model 3D TREAD is a fully three-dimensional diagenetic model specifically \ndesigned to investigate processes occurring at spherical microniches. The model, which is \napplied to a marine sediment here, can be used for either freshwater or marine systems. A \nbrief description of the model is given here; for a more comprehensive account see \nSochaczewski et al. (2008).  \nRather than providing a rigid framework where components and reactions are fixed, the \nmodel lets users specify all required parameters. For each individual component the \nfollowing conditions can be set: boundary conditions for the top and bottom of the domain \n(the domain is the modelled volume of sediment, constrained by x, y, and z lengths; the \nboundary conditions at the sides of the domain are treated as zero flux boundaries); diffusion \ncoefficients; microniche radius, coordinates and concentration; initial profiles (for t = 0 s). \nReactions and their rates are then specified for the components of interest. Reactions can be \n 6 \nspecified as primary (i.e. organic matter decomposition) or secondary, with primary reactions \nrequiring specification of a priority component (the OM oxidant) and a concentration \nthreshold, below which the reaction with the next priority can begin to proceed. Secondary \nreactions can be specified as first order for each reactant (overall order based on the number \nof reactants) or first order for a single component only (overall order of one).  \nAdditional parameters required include: resolution (this controls the density of the 3D mesh), \ntotal simulation run time, the time step between each calculation, and the time step between \neach data save (this allows the output file size to be constrained and reduces output \nprocessing times). The vertical porosity profile (and distinct values for each microniche), \ntogether with the equation for tortuosity (and associated variables), completes the set-up of \nthe model. As the model inputs are entered via a graphical user interface, parameters can be \naltered easily, allowing a range of scenarios to be tested.  \nIn adopting a Multi-G approach to organic matter degradation (where different pools of \norganic matter with different reactivity s are modelled), Westrich and Berner (1984) obtained \na ratio of rate constants for the fast reacting pool, kOM-f , to the slow reacting pool, kOM-s, of \n~10-17. We have followed, as our starting point, the rates used from the fast and slow \nreacting pools in Fossing et al. (2002). The ratio of the fast and slow reaction rate constants in \nthis study was 800. Studies of OM mineralization of typical microniche highly reactive \nmaterial have reported losses of labelled C of 85% over 18 days and 65% over 30 days for \ncarcass and faecal pellets respectively (Lee and Fisher, 1992). For whole phytoplankton \ndebris Newell et al. (1981) measured that over 30% of the OM is mineralized within 3 days, \nwith a more refractory fraction (~64%) taking up to 11 days for mineralization. The ranges of \nrate constants in this work are consistent with these and other observations of rapid OM \n 7 \nmineralization in the literature (more examples are discussed in section 3.2 in the context of \nniche lifetimes).   \nAs the effective rate (the rate constant multiplied by the organic matter concentration, \nadjusted for porosity) of the OM degradation reaction is dependent upon an ever decreasing \nOM pool the modelled OM concentration will never fall to zero. In defining the lifetime of \nthe niche an arbitrary choice needs to be made. We chose to define the niche lifetime as the \ntime taken for the OM concentration to fall to approximately two thirds of the value at the \nstart of the simulation (t35%).  \n2.2. Setup of Model Simulations  \nThe reactions applied to the modelling are shown in Table 1 (primary reactions) and Table 2 \n(secondary reactions). We have excluded phosphorus from the primary reactions in our \nmodel, as it takes no part in reactions with the dissolved phases of Fe2+ and sulfide. Full \nmodel parameters (required inputs as described in section 2.1.) are listed in Table 3. The \nenvironmental framework (i.e. the sediment s chemistry and physical properties) is based on \na comprehensive data set for a marine sediment by Fossing et al. (2002; 2004). The model \nreaction and transport equations, and associated parameters in this study, are partly based \nupon previous studies (Froelich et al., 1979; van Cappellen and Wang, 1996; Wang and van \nCappellen, 1996; Rysgaard et al., 1998). These data include all of the required inputs with the \nexception of the microniche specification. As we model a smaller domain, boundary \nconditions are derived from the 1D sediment profiles presented by Fossing et al. (2002; \n2004). Niches of reactive organic matter are assumed to have negligible iron or manganese \noxides available for OM oxidation. Where the niche surface contacts the bulk sediment these \n 8 \noxidants are assumed to be available. Few data exist on the size distributions and stochastic \npositions of microniches in sediments. Moreover, these properties are likely to vary greatly \ndepending on the site studied. For these reasons we do not attempt to quantify the total effect \nof these properties. However, we do discuss what effects microniches may have on overall \ndiagenetic processes and the extent to which bioturbation will negate the influence of iron \nsulfide formation at microniches.  \nWe have modelled a scenario where the niche is present below the oxygen and nitrate \npenetration depths (0.67 cm below the sediment water interface), consistent with observed \nniches in anoxic and suboxic sediments (Widerlund and Davison, 2007; Zhu et al., 2006). \nThis nitrate penetration depth represents the top of the modelled domain and is designated as \nx = 0 cm in our modelled scenarios. Previous 3D modelling has investigated sulfide evolution \nin this near surface zone (Sochaczewski et al., 2008). Faecal pellets deposited in situ may \ntypically have nominal diameters of hundreds of \u00b5m (e.g. Watling 1988; Wild et al., 2005). \nHowever, larger in situ pellets have been observed with nominal diameters of 1.4 to 3.5 mm \n(Taghon et al., 1984). Nominal diameters of marine snow particles have been observed to \ncover similar ranges (Alldredge and Cohen, 1987; Shanks and Reeder, 1993), as well as \nlarger values (Hamner et al., 1975). Dead organisms will generally constitute larger \nmicroniches than faecal pellets or marine snow. To make this study relevant to each of these \nparticle types we chose a niche diameter of 3 mm.  \nSeveral studies have compared the organic matter concentrations in faecal pellets to those \nfrom bulk surface sediment (Kristensen and Pilgaard, 2001; Wild et al., 2005). After \nadjustment for dry weight, the pellets are typically enriched by 11-13 times the OM \n 9 \nconcentration in the sediment. We have used a conservative estimate of 5 times the bulk \nsediment OM in our simulations.   \nPorosity outside the niche was set as 0.83, consistent with the data compilation used for the \nbulk values. Microniche porosity was varied to examine its effect. The range considered \nwas from high porosity ( = 0.97, 0.9) to niches denser ( = 0.8, 0.7) than the ambient value. \nChanging porosity has the effect of varying the OM concentration (per unit volume). This \ngives a maximum range of one order of magnitude to the OM concentration in our \nsimulations. Porosity also has a large affect on the effective diffusion coefficients within \nmicroniches. The relationship linking porosity to tortuosity exerts an additional control on the \ndiffusion coefficient calculations. Where niches are more porous than the surrounding \nsediment, solute transport is faster within the niche. Less porous niches have more restricted \ntransport than in the surrounding sediment. Several studies have investigated the water \ncontent and porosity of microniche particles. Plough et al. (2008) measured the porosity of \nmarine snow ( = 0.996), diatom\/phytoplankton aggregates ( = 0.959-0.992) and faecal \npellets of specific organisms ( = 0.43-0.65). Water content in faecal pellets has been \nobserved to be higher than the ambient sediment (80% compared to 58%; Kristensen and \nPilgaard, 2001). The ranges observed in the literature justify our decision to investigate a \nrange of porosities rather than OM concentrations.  \n2.3. Treatment of Iron-Sulfide Reactions  \nSulfide removal mechanisms were via diffusion and reaction with Fe2+. Sulfide formation is \nsolely from the degradation of organic matter with sulfate as the oxidant. S0 is formed from \nthe oxidation of H2S by Fe and Mn oxides. Disproportionation of particulate sulfur yields \n 10 \nsulfate and sulfide. Previous modelling by Berg et al., (2003) specifies that the \ndisproportionation reaction to form sulfate and sulfide does not proceed if the sulfide \nconcentration exceeds a critical level of 10 \u00b5M. As the sulfide concentration in the modelled \nmicroniches rapidly climbs far above the critical level (seconds to minutes), we have \nexcluded this reaction. Iron sulfide precipitation\/dissolution reactions are often modelled \nassuming reversible reactions, typically expressed as separate reactions for formation and \ndissolution. Whether or not the saturation conditions are met controls which of the two \nreactions can proceed (see, van Cappellen et al., 1993; Boudreau, 1996; Wang and van \nCappellen, 1996; for details of this approach). This relationship is widely used in diagenetic \nmodels (Wijsman et al., 2002; Morse and Eldridge, 2007). However, in other modelling cases \n(e.g. Berg et al., 2002; Fossing et al., 2004) a simple unidirectional formation reaction has \nbeen applied (Eq. 1). \nFeS2+Fe S(-II) FeSk\n  \n(1) \nA significant advantage of using this approach is that the complexities of modelling pH \nchanges within the model can be avoided. Furthermore, for our modelling this approach is \nappropriate, as saturation conditions are likely to apply throughout the small domain \nmodelled. Thus the reverse process is negligible and can effectively be excluded.   \nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed for the conversion of FeS to pyrite. These include \nreactions with polysulfide, hydrogen sulfide and reaction pathways with greigite \nintermediates (Hunger and Benning, 2007 and references therein). There are several \napproaches to pyrite formation in modelling studies. Berg et al. (2003) and Fossing et al. \n(2004) modelled formation by reaction of FeS with S0. Wijsman et al. (2002) used reaction of \nFeS with H2S. These two reactions follow the two proposed mechanisms for pyrite formation \nin nature (Rickard and Morse, 2005). Raiswell (1993) modelled pyrite formation directly \n 11 \nfrom reaction of Fe(II) and H2S. Rather than include an additional reaction, Wang and van \nCappellen (1996) represented all sulfur-bound iron as FeS. Given the uncertainty regarding \nthe best modelling approach to take, we also represent all sulfur bound iron as FeS. We \nrecognise that these simplifying assumptions limit the degree of detail of the simulations. \nHowever, they do not affect the trends in the general features of the solute and solid phase \nprofiles at the microniches.  \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \nThis section reports the results of the modelling and discusses them in terms of: \ntrends in iron, sulfide and the related saturation index (SI) with changing porosity, \nOM degradation rate and niche lifespan. \nrelating data from these trends to experimental observations \nassessing the optimum conditions for the formation of FeS crusts at microniches  \n3.1. Description of Modelled Scenarios  \nMicroniches with various properties were modelled. The effects of porosity and reaction rate \nof organic matter on the lifespan of a niche are shown to give a general overview, while \nspecific examples considered in more detail examine the generation of sulfide (and associated \nFe2+) profiles. The simulation conditions were devised to consider localized sulfide \nconcentrations and the associated lifespan of the niches, while making comparisons with \nreported reaction rates and experimental observations of niche lifespan. Modelling different \nporosities allow the results to be interpreted for a range of particle types, from high porosity \nniches such as algal aggregates to lower porosity particles such as faecal pellets. \n 12  \n3.2. Dissolved Iron(II) and Sulfide at Microniches  \n3.2.1. Trends Related to Porosity and Rate \nTypically observed values for the rate of decomposition of OM, porosity and microniche size \nwere used in the simulations, to ensure that the outputs can be related to realistic \nenvironmental scenarios. Figure 1 shows the relationship between reaction rate constants and \nmicroniche lifetime for niches with a range of porosities, Table 4 shows the parameters for \neach of the scenarios in the figure. The lettered data points in Figure 1 represent three groups \nof data where one of the parameters is constant. Group A (a, b, c, d) has constant porosity, \nwith the decreasing rate constant resulting in an increase in niche lifetime (t35%) across the \nseries. Group B (a, e, f, g) was obtained by setting a series with decreasing porosity and \nadjusting rate constants to give equal values for t35% (100 hours). For Group C (g, h, i, d) the \nrate constant was maintained and t35% calculated for the range of porosities. Within Group A \nMulti-G OM mineralization rate constant ratios (kom-f : kom-s) of 800, 1600, 4000 and 8000 \nwere used to generate outputs for d, c, b and a respectively. The t35% values for Group B lay \nwithin the range of very short microniche lifetimes observed by Alldredge and Cohen (1987) \nand Zhu et al. (2006). This demonstrates that the use of specific reaction rates for fast \nreacting organic matter, supports observations of very short niche lifetimes (as discussed in \nsection 2.1.).  \nFigure 2 shows, for each of the lettered groups and after 2.3 hours of the model simulations, \nthe sulfide and Fe2+ concentrations at the centre of the modelled microniches, and the \nsaturation index (SI). The time of 2.3 hours was chosen as this was the maximum time \nrequired for the Fe2+ and sulfide concentrations to reach a pseudo steady state (i.e. after this \n 13 \ntime there were no rapid changes in concentrations of Fe2+ and sulfide at the centre of the \nniche and their concentrations were controlled by removal and resupply processes rather than \namounts present at the start of the simulation). Results after 2.3 hours give the maximum \nsulfide values, as after this time ever decreasing niche OM concentration results in a \ndecreasing sulfide flux. The saturation index (Figure 2) is related to the solubility product of \nFeS (KSP) and the ion activity products (IAP; Eqs. 2 and 3). \n2+ - +IAP = {Fe }{HS }\/{H }\n    \n(2) \nSPSI = log(IAP\/ )K      (3)  \nIAP was calculated assuming a pH of 7 (consistent with marine porewater values that are \ntypically lower than the overlying water (e.g. Ben-Yaakov, 1973; Zhu et al., 2006) and ionic \nstrength of 0.7 M, with activity coefficients of, Fe2+ = 0.255, HS- = 0.410, H+ = 0.958, \n(values for Fe2+ and H+ were calculated using the Pitzer equation and associated variables as \nreported in Millero and Schreiber, 1982; bisulfide value is that reported in Davison, 1980). \nDecreasing the rate constant and maintaining a fixed porosity (Group A) results in decreasing \npeak sulfide values, due to lower generation of sulfide fluxes within the niche. The Fe2+ \nconcentration at the centre of the niche is determined by several opposing factors. (1) As \nsulfide produced in the niche diffuses out, it reduces FeOOH in the surrounding sediment and \nthe resulting Fe2+ diffuses in. (2) Fe2+ is also supplied to the system, as FeOOH is used as an \nelectron acceptor for the oxidation of bulk OM adjacent to the niche. (3) Fe2+ is continuously \nremoved at all locations by reaction with HS- to form FeS. The peaked distribution for Fe2+ \ncan be ascribed to changes in the relative dominance of these three processes. The SI is \nstrongly dependent on sulfide for Group A.  \nWhere OM degradation rate constants are adjusted for different porosity microniches, to give \nequal lifetimes for all niches (Group B), diffusion and reaction with sulfide controls the peak \n 14 \nvalues of Fe2+ and diffusion and the rate constant controls peak sulfide. As the porosity \ndecreases, both diffusion and reaction rates are lowered, decreasing both the inward Fe2+ flux \nand the outward flux of sulfide. In this marine system the sulfate removal rate is not high \nenough to cause this electron acceptor to become unavailable at the niche centre in any of the \nmodelled scenarios. Limited supply of Fe2+ tends to exert the main control on the SI within \nthis group.  \nWhere porosity ( ) is increased at a constant OM degradation rate constant (Group C) sulfide \ndecreases due to a reduced flux caused by the lower physical amount of reactive OM within \nthe niche (accounted for in the model calculation by a (1- ) function). Across this group the \npeak concentration of Fe2+ increases, as diffusion is faster and removal by sulfide is lower. \nThe highest values for the SI are observed at intermediate porosities. The SI in this group is \ncontrolled by more than one species. Within the lowest porosity niche it is constrained by \nlimited diffusion of Fe2+ into the niche, while within the highest porosity niche it is \nconstrained by lower sulfide concentrations caused by a reduced sulfide flux. These processes \nare represented visually in Figure 3, which shows 2D profiles of S(-II), Fe2+ and FeS after \n24 hours for scenario g. Figure 4 shows a schematic of how FeS may preferentially form at \nthe edges of niche, which is shown by the modelled data in part c of Figure 3.  \n3.2.2. Relating General Trends from the Modelled Data to Experimental Observations \nPeak sulfide concentrations for the microniches are high when compared to porewater values \nfrom electrode studies. For example, Sell and Morse (2006) reported a sulfide concentration \nof ~0.3 \u00b5M for a marine sediment, approximately 2 cm below the oxygen penetration depth. \nIf this value is representative of a background measurement, in the modelled microniche, \npeak concentrations are between ~15 and 240 times the background value. Using DGT to \n 15 \nmeasure sulfide in a freshwater sediment, Motelica-Heino et al. (2003), reported a sulfidic \nmicroniche with concentrations approximately 30 times the average background value, in \nagreement with the above range. Sagemann et al. (1999) set up laboratory experiments to \ndetermine conditions that may result in mineral formation at the soft tissue of benthic \norganisms (via precipitation of carbonates and phosphates as well as sulfides). They \nmeasured sulfide concentrations at the edge of a decomposing shrimp carcass of ~5.6 mM. \nThis value fits into the range of values modelled here (0.46-7.1 mM). These data highlight the \nstark contrast in the chemistry of microniches compared to their surroundings. Our calculated \nvalues for Fe2+ concentrations are consistent with observations at similar depths, e.g. Morford \net al. (2003) who observed concentrations of ~500 \u00b5M at 2 cm depth.  \nThe ratios of the total-sulfide to Fe2+ concentrations calculated from the data in Figure 2 fall \nin the range 1.6 to 169. When the lifetimes greater than 7 days are excluded (Figure 1, points \nb, c, d and i), the lowest ratio is 30. For microniches within a freshwater lake sediment, \nsulfide concentrations have been observed to be over 40 times higher than those of Fe2+ \n(Motelica-Heino et al., 2003). These agreements between measurement and modelling further \nsupports the assertion that niche lifetimes of less than one week are the most representative of \nnatural conditions.  \n3.3. Iron Sulfide at Microniches  \nThe solubility of freshly formed iron sulfide in circumneutral sediment tends to be controlled \nby the solubility product related to the bisulfide concentration (Eq. 4).  \n   \n(4) \n 16 \nWe calculated the distribution of sulfide species in simple sulfide solutions with a pH of 6, 7 \nand 8, an ionic strength of 0.7 and assuming [S2-] is negligible (activity coefficients were H+ \n= 0.96, HS- = 0.41 and H2S = 1.0). At pH 6, 7 and 8 approximately 19%, 70% and 96% \nrespectively, of the total sulfide will be present as bisulfide. The pH within marine sediments \nhas been observed to span this range. Zhu et al. (2006), using planar optodes, measured pH at \na dead decaying organism (which can be considered a microniche) and reported pH at or \nbelow the detection limit of 5.9. Average pH between 1-6 cm below the sediment water \ninterface, in the same sediment without the microniche but with burrowing activity, was ~6.8 \nwith maxima of ~pH 8 and minima of pH 6.2.   \nThe SI data for Figure 2 were calculated at pH 7. Using these data the degree of saturation of \nFeS can be calculated. The lowest and highest values for SI are 1.97 and 2.6, equivalent to a \ndegree of saturation of 94 and 400 respectively. It is possible that levels of saturation will not \nreach these values due to the formation of other mineral phases.  \nBerner (1980) suggested that concretions of pyrite may be formed by heterogeneous \nreduction of sulfate at clots  of organic matter. The sulfide reacts with Fe2+ diffusing towards \nthe niche from the surrounding sediment to form iron sulfides that eventually transform to \npyrite. The amount of FeS or pyrite formed is limited by the amount of decomposable organic \nmatter in the niche and the resupply of Fe2+. Berner (1980) proposed that a crust of pyrite will \nform adjacent to the organic matter. When viewed in 2D as a cross section through the niche, \nthe iron sulfide precipitate appears as a halo shape (Figures 3c and 4). We use the term \ncrust to describe where FeS is preferentially deposited at the edge of the niche rather than \ncontinuously throughout the volume. In modelling scenarios a-i in Figure 1, we have \ndetermined the distribution of iron sulfide after 24 hours of each of the model runs. Figure 5 \n 17 \nshows the vertical FeS profiles through the centre of each niche from these simulations and \nidentifies the profile shape for each of the modelled scenarios. These results show that the \nonly scenario where there is no localisation in FeS formation within the niche has the lowest \nrate and highest niche lifetime of all the simulations. All other simulations give some \nlocalisation within the organic matter parcel. Other simulations with niche lifetimes greater \nthan 145 hours (b, c, i) give localisation within the niche, but do not give significant crustal \ndeposition of FeS. Simulations with short niche lifetimes (<145 hours, a, e, f, g, h) give \nsignificant crustal deposition, with ratios of the peak FeS concentration to that at the centre of \nthe niche above 2.7. Within this series, as the porosity and the rate constant decrease the crust \nbecomes more defined. Scenario g (Figure 4) gives the most defined crust with a peak to \ncentre FeS ratio of 7.  \nThe modelling has shown, a priori, that the concept described by Berner (1980) can be \nexplained quantitatively by the microniche model, and that short niche lifetimes give the best \nresults in terms of the definition of the crustal nature of these iron sulfide deposits. In \nlimiting our modelling to FeS, we recognise that preservation of the morphology of the niche \nwill depend on the rate and extent of transformation into pyrite and that this will depend upon \nthe availability of intermediates in the conversion reaction to pyrite (such as polysulfide).  \n3.3.1. Relevance of Microniche FeS Deposition to Paleoenvironmental Studies  \nIt is important to recognise the significance of the observed precipitation behaviour to the \nstudy of the preservation of microniches in the paleo record. Much work has focused on the \nprocesses involved in the preservation of soft-matter in the fossil record (e.g. Briggs et al., \n1991; 1996; Raiswell et al., 1993; 2008). The conclusion that niche lifetimes of 2.5-5 days \ngive better defined crustal deposition is supported by the work of Sagemann et al. (1999). \n 18 \nThey concluded that: 1) mineralization will be dominated by dysaerobic and anaerobic \nreactions, even in oxic sediments; 2) the most extensive mineral formation of soft tissues \noccurred under anoxic conditions; 3) steep chemical gradients during the decay process lead \nto mineral formation; 4) exceptional preservation of soft tissue is favoured by elevated \nmicrobial activity; 5) these critical controls that determine the balance between decay and \nmineral formation (points 1-4) must operate at an early stage following the death of an \norganism and mineral formation (leading ultimately to fossilisation) of soft tissue must be a \nrapid process (days to weeks), as it would not occur at the normal bulk efficiency of OM \ndegradation in marine sediments. We have shown that well defined crusts of FeS can occur at \nmicroniches in suboxic sediments very rapidly (days). The conditions that favour this \nformation are where the effective rate (the rate adjusted for the porosity; kOM \u00d7 (1- )) gives \nrapid mineralization of the organic matter. Precipitation at the crust, rather than throughout \nthe volume, is aided by the more restricted diffusion in the lower porosity niches.  \nSeveral observations by Briggs et al. (1996), who investigated controls on the pyritization of \nexceptionally preserved fossils, can be compared to our modelling results. Their work \nproposed that high dissolved Fe concentrations are the key factor in the preservation of these \nfossils. Our modelling results indicate that high sulfide concentration can also be a key driver \nin the formation of a FeS niche with a well preserved structure. However, we recognise that \nsignificantly restricted diffusion to\/from a niche may also result in well defined localised FeS \ndeposition. Briggs et al. (1996) measured enrichments in 34S isotope fractionation within \npyritized fossils compared to the surroundings. This enrichment can be explained by either \nthe restricted diffusion or the rapid sulfate consumption hypotheses. Both scenarios will \nresult in restricted supplies of 32S sulfate (that is used preferentially to 34S) to the niche for \n 19 \nOM degradation, and therefore 34S sulfate will be utilised within the niche to a greater degree \nthan the surrounding sediment.  \n3.4. Other Considerations  \n3.4.1. Effects of Bioturbation and Bioirrigation.  \nExclusion from our model of processes that account for bioirrigation and biodiffusivity, is \nappropriate given the nature of our modelling. It may be reasonable to expect that in a real \nsystem there will be small zones where these processes have no or little effect, at least over \ntime scales of a few days. In our simulations the concentration of Fe2+ can build up to levels \nmuch higher than would be the case if bioturbation or bioirrigation were included (Figure \n3b). The presence of fixed boundaries at the top and bottom of the domain results in an \nimposed flux out of the domain. In a heterogeneous system with bioturbation, there are likely \nto be localized zones where solutes diffuse toward secondary interfaces, such as burrows. We \naccept that our modelled scenarios may be simplistic in the treatment of such behaviour. As \nbioturbation operates on a larger scale than the microniches, it would be inappropriate to \nconsider its effects as averaged parameters for biodiffusion and bioirrigation. In using \ndiagenetic data from a combined experimental and modelling study (Fossing et al., 2002; \n2004), we have excluded any fitting parameters for bioturbation processes so that results \nreflect only processes occurring at and immediately adjacent to microniches.  \nOur simulations are performed for a sub-oxic sediment. It may be realistic to suppose that \nbioturbation may move degraded niches containing FeS to other locations in the sediment, \nincluding into the oxic zone. There may be partial or complete removal of localized iron \nsulfide precipitates due to reoxidation of FeS attributed to bioturbation. The extent of \n 20 \nbioturbation will be important as FeS in undisturbed particles (i.e. remaining present in sub-\noxic sediment) is likely to be converted to pyrite, which has slower oxidation rates. Smaller \nniches relocated to oxic sediment will reoxidize more quickly, so will need to be in contact \nwith oxygenated sediment for shorter times. Certain trace metals sulfides forming at \nmicroniches (such as tetrathiomolybdate) may be more resistant to reoxidation (Erickson and \nHelz, 2000). Therefore, regardless of the degree of bioturbation, microniches may be \nimportant zones for the formation of specific trace element sulfides.  \n3.4.2. Influence of Microniche pH \nFor simplicity we have assumed a microniche pH of 7 for all calculations in this work. \nHowever, complex distributions of pH may occur at microniches. Zhu et al. (2006) observed \npH at a dead decaying organism of 5.9, where the ambient pH was ~6.6. In this case there is \na concentration gradient of protons, which diffuse away from the niche. As pH becomes \nlower IAP s are reduced by two contributing factors; firstly, the pH term in the denominator \nof equation 4, and secondly, the equilibrium of sulfide species is shifted towards the H2S \nspecies. The result will be to reduce the formation rate for sulfides at the centre of the niche. \nAs the proton concentration gradient extends from the niche, this effect may enhance FeS \nformation at the niche edges compared to the niche centre and result in more contrast in the \nhalo effect (i.e. a higher ratio between the FeS at the crust and that in the centre of the \nniche). This will be the case because the increased proton concentration nearer the centre \n(compared to the edge) will shift the equilibrium of the FeS formation in the direction of the \nreverse reaction and thus will bias formation at the niche edge compared to the centre. The \nlower pH at the niche may be due, in part, to the combined effects of organic matter oxidation \n(i.e. sulfide formation) and the formation of sulfide phases such as FeS. However, complex \nbuffering processes occur within sediment porewaters (Ben-Yaakov, 1973; Soetaert et al., \n 21 \n2007). The extent to which the localized geochemistry of a niche allows deviation from \nbuffering effects is a question that requires further study.  \n3.4.3. Potential Influence of Diffusive Barriers Around Microniches \nIn the modelling reported here we have assumed that solute transport into and from the niche \nis controlled exclusively by diffusion (accounting also for the changes to diffusion \ncoefficients induced by porosity changes). Microniches in nature (including faecal pellets and \ndecaying organisms) will have a range of diffusional barriers, which will retard or prevent \ndiffusion across the niche edge. Faecal pellets may possess peritrophic membranes, dead tube \ndwelling organisms may have a mucus membrane lining the burrow wall at is edge, soft parts \nof shelled organisms will only have limited exposure to the bulk sediment, and decaying \norganisms with hard-parts may have complex structures that affect diffusion (see also \nStockdale et al., 2009). Where precipitates form surrounding a niche, it is possible that this \nwill create a barrier to diffusion. How diffusive restrictions affect the formation of sulfide \nprecipitates will largely depend upon the resupply of sulfate to the niche interior. In a \nscenario where diffusion is restricted yet sufficient to resupply sulfate, restriction in the efflux \nof sulfide will reduce the porewater Fe concentration that is required for precipitation at the \nniche edge, consistent with the conclusions of Raiswell et al. (1993).  \n3.4.3. Sensitivity to model assumptions \nWe have used a conservative estimate for the niche organic matter concentration, of \napproximately half the value determined by Kristensen and Pilgaard (2001). Whilst the \nporosity variations modelled here effectively cover a factor of 10 change in the OM \nconcentration, as these changes also affect diffusive transport, it is constructive to test the \nmodel for a higher OM concentration at a given porosity. We modelled two niches with the \n 22 \nsame parameters as scenarios a and d except the OM concentration was doubled, these \nscenarios were chosen as they have contrasting niche lifetimes. Increased OM in scenario a \nresulted in an increase to the definition of the crust (edge to centre FeS ratio of ~8.3, \ncompared to ~2.6 for the lower OM concentration modelling) as well as a higher peak crust \nFeS concentration. The peak sulfide concentration more than doubles, resulting in a decrease \nin Fe2+; the IAP is not significantly changed. Increased OM in scenario d approximately \ndoubled the FeS concentration, but did not improve definition of FeS at the crust of the niche.   \nWhilst many microniche particles will not contain significant levels of Mn or Fe oxides, \nniches such as faecal pellets from burrowing organisms are likely to contain these oxidants. \nTo test the effect of their presence, we modelled scenario h with the inclusion of oxides at the \nsame level as the surrounding sediment. At the given rate, the Mn and Fe oxides within the \nniche are exhausted quickly (<3 hrs). This creates a pulse of dissolved Fe that remains \nelevated for 2-3 hours. After this time (5-6 hrs in total) the profiles show a sulfide peak \ncoincident with Fe2+ depletion at the niche centre, similar to scenarios where no oxides are \npresent. Peak FeS levels after 24 hours are elevated by 50% when compared to the same \nscenario without the oxides present. Preferential deposition at the edge of the niche does not \nbegin to become evident until after 10 hours has elapsed.  \n4. CONCLUSIONS  \nWe have modelled the behaviour of sulfide and iron within microniches with a range of \norganic matter (OM) degradation rates and porosities. For all of the modelled scenarios the \nion activity product for iron sulfide far exceeds the solubility product, indicating conditions \nfor FeS precipitation in all niches. Those simulations within the t35% range of 2.5 to 5 days \n 23 \ngave comparable concentration ratios of sulfide to iron in solution within the particles to \nexperimentally observed values. Applying rates for fast reacting OM similar to those in the \nliterature, OM in the niche is rapidly consumed, demonstrating their very short lifetimes.  \nOur model results provide insight into the mechanisms of preservation of OM, including soft \ntissue, in the paleo record, by predicting the conditions that result in preferential deposition of \nprecipitates at the edge of microniches. All but one of our simulations showed some \nlocalisation of FeS precipitate at the niche. Simulations with short niche lifetimes (<145 \nhours) give significant crustal deposition, with ratios of the peak FeS concentration to that at \nthe centre of the niche above 2.7. Maximum ratios of crust to centre deposition occur where \nthe niche lifetime is shorter and the porosity is lower. Application of these results to larger \nscale diagenesis will require a more quantitative assessment of distribution, properties and \ntranslocation of microniches within the sediment.  \nAcknowledgements.

Group A has \nconstant porosity, Group B has conditions where t35% is constant, Group C has a constant OM \ndegradation rate. Note that the axis for the SI values does not start at zero. The trends relate to \nthe changes associated with the transition across the groups, i.e. a to d, a to g, and g to d. \n 29 \nFigure 3. Total sulfide ( S(-II), a), Fe2+ (b) and FeS (c) concentrations across the x axis of \nthe modelled domain after 24 hours (y coordinate was the centre of the microniche). The \nmicroniche (scenario g in Figure 1) had a porosity of 0.7, an OM degradation rate constant of \n9.6 \u00d7 10-6 s-1 and an OM concentration of 5 M (representing 21.6 \u00b5mol of OM in 14.4 mm-3, \nvolume specific dry mass). The boundary values are explained in section 2.2.  \nFigure 4.
