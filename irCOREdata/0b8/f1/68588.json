The distribution of paths for large fluctuations away from a stable\nstate has been investigated, theoretically and by analog experiment. We have\nfound critical broadening of the distribution of the paths coming to a cusp point\nrepresenting the simplest generic singularity in the pattern of most probable\n(optimal) fluctuational paths in a non-equilibrium system. The critical behavior\ncan be described by a Landau-type theory.\nA wide variety of physical phenomena, ranging from nucleation at phase\ntransitions to failures of electronic devices, are driven by large rare fluctua-\ntions. In many cases the fluctuating systems of interest are far from thermal\nequilibrium. It was recognized by Onsager and Machlup [1] that an insight\ninto the physics of large fluctuations can be gained from an analysis of the dis-\ntribution of fluctuational paths along which the system moves to a given state.\nThis distribution is a fundamental characteristic of the fluctuation dynamics,\nand its understanding paves the way to controlling the fluctuations. It peaks\nsharply at the optimal (i.e. most probable) path; we report below the first\nexperimental observations of this pattern.\nIn thermal equilibrium, with white noise, the optimal paths are time-\nreversed deterministic paths [2]. But this is not true for nonequilibrium\nsystems, because they lack time reversibility.

Optimal paths represent the extrema of a variational\nproblem. A generic property of the pattern of extreme paths is the occurrence\nof caustics [4], in general starting in pairs from a cusp (focal) point: see Fig. 1.\nCaustics and cusps in the pattern of extreme paths have been found nu-\nmerically [5] and investigated analytically [6]. Note that contributions to the\nprobability distribution from different paths are all positive: interference ef-\nfects do not occur and the singularities in the pattern of optimal paths are\ntherefore different from those known for wave fields [6]. Although optimal\nfluctuational paths do not encounter caustics, but they can focus into cusp\npoints. Use of the prehistory probability density [7] (see below) enables us to\nreveal and analyze the singular behavior, theoretically and experimentally [8].\nSINGULAR BEHAVIOR OF THE DISTRIBUTION\nOF FLUCTUATIONAL PATHS\nThe simplest system that displays singularities of optimal paths is an over-\ndamped Brownian particle driven by a periodic force K(q; t),\nq = K(q; t) + ~(t), K(q; t) = K(q; t + T),\n(~(t)~(t')) = D8(t - t').\nFor small noise intensities D, within a rela.'Cationtime Tr the system (1) will\napproach the stable periodic state q(O}(t), q(O} = K(q(O}; t), q(O}(t + T) =\nq(O}(t), and a periodic stationary probability distribution will be formed in the\nbasin of attraction to this state.\nAnalysis of the prehistory probability density, Ph(q, tl qj, tj) [7] enables the\ndistribution of paths in large fluctuations to be investigated and visualized. It\nis the conditional probability density for a system that had been fluctuating\nabout q(O)(t) for a time greatly exceeding Tr, and arrived to the point qj at\nthe instant tj, to have passed through the point q at the instant t (t < tj). It\ncan be written as a path integral:\nPh(q,tlqj,tj) = const x lq(t!)=q! 1Jq(t')exp [- S[qD(t)]]\nq( ti )~q(O) (ti)\nx8(q(t) - q), ti -+ -00, J dqph(q,tlqj,tj) = 1 (2)\nHere, S[q] determines the probability distribution over the paths of a Marko-\nvian system. To lowest order in the noise intensity D it takes the form of\nthe action functional for an auxiliary dynamical system with the Lagrangian\nL(q,qjt) (cr. [9]):\nS[q(t)] = [it! dtL(q, qj t), L(q, q; t) = ~[q - K(qj tWo (3)\nFIGURE 1. Extreme paths of (1) for K = q - q3 + 0.264 cos 1.2t. The stable state q(O) (t)\nfrom the vicinity of which the paths start is shown by the dashed line. The bold line\nemanating from the cusp point is the switching line calculated for D -t O. The data points\nshow the maxima of the prehistory probability distribution measured for three final points\naway from the cusp. Reduced variances of the corresponding Gaussian distributions (72\n(displaced along the ordinate axis for clarity) are comp\u00a5ed with the theory in the inset.\nThe optimal (most probable) fluctuational path qopt(tl q\/, t \/) along which the\nsystem arrives at q\/ at time t\/ is found by solving the variational problem\n8S[q] = 0 (I )8q(t) , qopt t\/ q\/, t\/ = q\/,\nqopt(til q\/, t\/) -+ q(O) (ti) for ti -+ -00.\nBut Eq.(4) describes extreme fluctuational paths, which are not necessarily\nthe optimal paths that provide the global minimum of the action S[q] and are\ntherefore of physical significance. Extreme paths q(t) as given by (3), (4) can\nintersect, since a dynamical system with the Lagrangian (3) is nonintegrable.\nIn contrast, generically only one optimal path can arrive at a given point.\nThe shape of the prehistory probability density Ph (2) can be found by\nexpanding the coordinate q(t) into the orthonormal functions 1\/Jn(t) which\ndiagonalize the second variation of the action:\nq(t) = qopt(tlq\"t\/) + l:an1\/Jn(t).\nn\nIt follows from (3) that the functions 1\/Jn(t)satisfy a Schrodinger-type equation\n..

(8)\nn\nNear the maximum, the distribution Ph is evidently Gaussian in the distance of\n(q, t) from the optimal path qopt(tl qf, tf) (cf. [7]). Therefore by investigating\nPh one can find directly the optimal path itself, and also analyze the shape\nof the tube of paths arriving at a given point (qf, tf), Away from the cusp\npoint, the width of this tube is ex D1\/2\u2022 The reduced width of the distribution\n(8) a(tl qf, tf) is independent of qf, tf for tf - t :\u00bb Tr: it gives the reduced\nu 4-U\nC\"'\n;:;a-.s::.C. 2\nq\nFIGURE 3.

The distribution is Gaussian very close to, and far from, the cusp; but\nit is critically broadened and strongly non-Gaussian at intermediate values of t.\nwidth of the stationary Gaussian distribution about q(Ol(t). Experiments on\nan analog electronic model of (1), based on astandard technique [10},have\nyielded results which are in a very good agreement with Eqs. (4), (8); see\nFig. 1 (the explicit form of a(tl qf' t f) is given in [8]).\nEq.(8) does not apply if the final point (qf, tf) is close to a singularity of the\npattern of extreme paths [8]. The origin of the singularities can be understood\nfrom topological arguments [6]: see Fig. 2. The trajectories of the auxiliary\nHamiltonian system (3) form a Lagrangian manifold (LM) in the phase space\nof the system. Projections of these trajectories onto the (q, t) plane are optimal\npaths. The Lagrangian manifold in the space (t,q,p) is also shown: note that\np == 8L\/8q = q-K(q, t) is a momentum of the au..xiliarysystem corresponding\nto the coordinate q. Generically the LM can have folds emerging in pairs from\nthe cusp, and it is their projections onto the plane (q, t) that creates the\ncaustics. Caustics and cusp points are the only generic structurally stable\nsingularities of the pattern of extreme paths of S[q] (3) [llJ. Since caustics\nmay not [6] be observed in the pattern of optimal paths, it is particularly\ninteresting to investigate the distribution Ph near a cusp point (qc, tc). If the\nfinal point (qf, t f) coincides with (qc, tc), then the smallest eigenvalue AO = 0\n[4Jand Eq. (8) does not apply; in particular, a diverges for AO = o.\nAt the cusp point it is necessary [4] to keep in the expansion of the action\ns (7) the higher-order terms in the amplitude ao of the \"soft mode\" 'l\/Jo(t).\nDetailed analysis shows [8] that, when (qf, tf) approaches (qc, tc), fluctuations\nabout the optimal path become strongly non-Gaussian. The characteristic\nwidth of the distribution, tv D1\/4, is determined by the soft mode 'l\/Jo(t). The\nmeasured and calculated evolutions of the distribution with t - tc are in good\nagreement: see Fig. 3.\nIn conclusion, we have used general topological arguments, and the concept\nof the prehistory probability distribution, to analyze singular features of the\npattern of optimal fluctuational paths in systems away from thermal equilib-\nrium. We have described theoretically, and observed, critical broadening of\nthe distribution of paths arriving in the vicinity of a cusp point.\n1. L. Onsager and S. Machlup, Phys.
