There are\nalso early signs that it may be contributing to a reduction in social spending\nin key sectors such as education, housing and basic sanitation, possibly\nundermining the country\u2019s future social and economic development.\nINTRODUCTION\nBrazil has enthusiastically embraced conditional cash transfer (CCT) pro-\ngrammes as part of mainstream social policy in the fight against poverty\nand exclusion. Although this process started in the 1990s at sub-national\nlevel, Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso or FHC (1995\u20132002) and es-\npecially Luiz Ina\u00b4cio \u2018Lula\u2019 da Silva (2003\u2013) rapidly expanded and consoli-\ndated a number of such schemes into what today is known as Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia\n(Family Grant). This follows a major recent international trend in policy\nmaking, especially evident in Latin America, towards constructing targeted\nsocial safety nets to protect the poor (Barrientos and Hulme, 2008; Hall and\nI would like to thank Renata Bichir of CEBRAP (Sa\u02dco Paulo) for facilitating access to research\ndata. Valuable feedback was provided by two anonymous reviewers.\nDevelopment and Change 39(5): 799\u2013822 (2008). C\u00a9 Institute of Social Studies 2008. Published\nby Blackwell Publishing, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK and 350 Main St.,\nMalden, MA 02148, USA\n800 Anthony Hall\nMidgley, 2004; ILO, 2006; Rawlings, 2004).1 CCT programmes have been\nimplemented in a number of middle-income countries apart from Brazil,\nincluding Mexico (Progresa\/Oportunidades), Chile (Chile Solidario),\nColombia (Familias en Accio\u00b4n), Argentina (Jefes de Hogar), Peru (Juntos),\nEcuador (Bono de Desarrollo Humano) and elsewhere.2\nIn part, the use of targeted safety nets and social funds has represented\na form of compensation for the adverse impacts upon the poor of sta-\nbilization and structural adjustment policies implemented throughout the\n1980s and 1990s (Conway, 2000; Cornia et al., 1987). In Latin Amer-\nica, social spending cutbacks under adjustment eroded the social pro-\ntection infrastructure in a region where effective and universal welfare\nsystems had been developed in only a handful of countries.3 Furthermore,\nthe lion\u2019s share of state subsidies in key areas such as health, education\nand pensions was already monopolized by the middle and upper classes,\nleaving little fiscal space for directly benefiting the poor more broadly\nthrough redistributive social policies. The notion of providing universal\nbenefits and citizenship rights, with the exception of Cuba, has been es-\nchewed in favour of selective provision based on politically determined\ndistribution by the state to more influential social groups (Abel and Lewis,\n2002).\nConditional cash transfers have become increasingly popular for a num-\nber of reasons. They are designed to attack long-term poverty by making\npayments conditional upon school attendance and participation in health\ncare, boosting effective demand and thus strengthening human capital in\nan expression of joint responsibility between government and families. By\nfocusing on children and women, the expectation is that such measures\ngo well beyond offering relief and can attack the inter-generational trans-\nmission of poverty by promoting synergies between education, health and\nother sectors. They are seen as a more cost-effective means of reaching the\npoor directly through efficient targeting while minimizing resource wastage.\nIn the words of one major World Bank study, cash transfers are seen as\n\u2018an alternative to more traditional and paternalistic approaches to social\nassistance\u2019 (Rawlings, 2004: 6). Yet as will be discussed below, this re-\nmains a highly contentious issue in Brazil and indeed elsewhere in Latin\nAmerica.\n1. \u2018Safety nets\u2019 is a broad label for short-term, targeted measures aimed at vulnerable individ-\nuals and households designed to mitigate the immediate effects of poverty and other risks.\nAssistance may be provided in the form of one or a combination of cash, food, housing,\nsubsidies, fee waivers, scholarships and employment through public works programmes.\n2. Some low-income countries have also been experimenting with CCTs on a smaller scale,\nincluding Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Kenya, Lesotho, Mongolia, Honduras and\nPakistan (ILO, 2006).\n3. Namely: Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba and Uruguay (Abel and Lewis, 2002).\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia: A Double-edged Sword? 801\nSOCIAL SPENDING AND CASH TRANSFERS IN BRAZIL\nBefore examining the evolution and performance of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia and its\npredecessors in Brazil, it is revealing to examine the evolution of spending\non CCTs within the overall social budget. Total social expenditure in Brazil\nstands at almost 13 per cent of GDP (Table 1). During 2006, social security\nincluding pensions accounted for around 69 per cent of total social spending,\nhealth 14 per cent and education 6 per cent. Around 44 per cent is absorbed by\npensions alone (compared with 33 per cent on average for OECD countries),\na figure exceeded only by Mexico and Italy (Brazil, 2005a, 2005b; IPEA,\n2006a).\n\u2018Social assistance\u2019 directed at the poorest remains a relatively small pro-\nportion of the total budget at some 7.5 per cent, with Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia account-\ning for two-fifths of this amount, or 2.9 per cent of total social expenditure.\nWhat is noticeable, however, is that there has been a steady expansion since\nthe late 1990s in social spending for the poorest through general programmes\nand for cash transfers in particular (Table 1; Fig. 1). While social spending\nincreased in real terms by 23 per cent between 2001 and 2004, direct income\ntransfers of all kinds expanded at the significantly higher rate of 29 per cent\n(Lavinas, 2006). Under FHC (1995\u20132002) social assistance spending for the\npoor rose to 5.6 per cent (R$ 10.2 billion) of the total social budget. This\ngrew significantly to 7.5 per cent (R$ 22 billion) under Lula by 2006.\nThe increase in spending on CCTs over this period has been even more\nmarked. In 2002, the final year of the FHC administration, these accounted\nfor almost one-quarter of spending on the poor (R$ 2.4 billion). Expenditure\non CCTs rose sharply from 2003 to 2004 with the inauguration of Bolsa\nFam\u0131\u00b4lia and by 2006, the last year of Lula\u2019s first government, this had\nincreased significantly to take up 38 per cent (R$ 8.2 billion) of the social\nassistance budget, aimed at the poorest groups. Overall, spending on CCTs\ngrew from less than 1 per cent of the total social budget in 2001 to 2.9 per cent\nin 2006. Under Lula, spending on Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia increased from 0.2 to 0.5\nper cent of GDP by 2005 (Lindert, 2005). It would thus be fair to say that the\nrhetoric of increased financial support for the poor which has characterized\nPresident Lula\u2019s electoral campaigning and policy platform has indeed been\nmatched by actual spending, at least as far as CCTs are concerned. Yet to\nkeep matters in perspective, it should be borne in mind that these conditional\ncash payments remain a small percentage of total social spending and are,\nfor example, far outweighed by pensions.4\nFOME ZERO: THE EARLY DAYS\nAs Brazil\u2019s first working-class President, with a long history of trade union\nactivity and opposition to military dictatorship behind him, Lula owed his\n4.

He projected (and continues to project) a strong image of personal\ncommitment to addressing the needs of poorer Brazilians. On taking office\nin January 2003, President Lula nailed his colours firmly to the mast when\nhe famously declared that: \u2018If by the end of my term of office every Brazilian\nhas enough food to eat three times a day, I shall have fulfilled my mission\nin life\u2019. Early in the Lula administration, Fome Zero (Zero Hunger) was\nannounced to mark out the Workers\u2019 Party (PT) as socially progressive and\ndetermined to attack poverty head-on.5\nDespite the fanfare with which Fome Zero was launched, it was in fact\nan umbrella term for several programmes that had already been developed\nunder the administration of Lula\u2019s predecessor, President FernandoHenrique\nCardoso. These federal schemes had in turn evolved from earlier national\n5. Fome Zero was the brainchild of Jose\u00b4 Graziano da Silva, former professor of agrarian\nstudies at the University of Campinas, Sa\u02dco Paulo, and appointed by Lula to head the new\nMinistry of Food Security and Fight against Hunger.\n804 Anthony Hall\nand state-level initiatives implemented during the 1990s.6 Re-packaged as\nFome Zero, four federal schemes were brought together under a single label:\nthe flagship Bolsa Escola for boosting school attendance, Bolsa Alimentac\u00b8a\u02dco\nfor maternal nutrition, the PETI programme7 against child labour and the\nAux\u0131\u00b4lio Ga\u00b4s cooking gas subsidy. A new food entitlement scheme known as\nCarta\u02dco Alimentac\u00b8a\u02dco was added, which uses a special electronic card for the\npurchase of selected food items.\nBolsa Escola (School Grant) was the highest profile sub-programme, ac-\ncounting for the bulk of spending. It providedmotherswith amonthly stipend\nper child enrolled in return for their children attending school at least 85 per\ncent of the time. It had its origins in local school grant schemes implemented\nin Campinas, Sa\u02dco Paulo and in the federal district of Bras\u0131\u00b4lia during the\nmid-1990s, and was adopted nationally in 2001. By 2003 it had spread to\nnearly all of Brazil\u2019s 5,561 municipalities, disbursing over US$ 500 million\nin grants to over 5 million families with 8.6 million children.\nConsolidation of these safety net programmes under Fome Zero brought\nsome innovations, however. Implementation of the programme was decen-\ntralized to municipal level in an attempt to promote greater efficiency, trans-\nparency and accountability, while the introduction of a food card systemwas\nmeant to help eliminate fraud. The private sector also became involved as\nmajor companies such as Ford and Unilever, as well as supermarket chains,\nwere invited to contribute in a gesture of corporate social responsibility.\nAt the same time, international donors such as the World Bank and the\nInter-American Development Bank moved speedily to publicly endorse\nLula\u2019s strong anti-poverty stance.Fome Zerofitted in nicelywith an emerging\ninternational body of intellectual and financial support for the construction\nof safety nets as a major arm of social policy, adherence to which belied the\nPT administration\u2019s radical \u2018left-leaning\u2019 image. In the wake of the collapse\nof the Soviet Union and comprehensive social security schemes, along with\nthe Asian crisis, targeted social protection measures couched in the terms\nof \u2018social risk management\u2019 became mainstreamed. In addition to providing\nshort-term relief, CCT and similar schemes would strengthen livelihoods\nand build human capital as a \u2018springboard\u2019 for development (World Bank,\n2000).8\nYet despite the initial enthusiasm for Fome Zero both at home and abroad,\nonly a few months into the Lula administration disillusionment set in due\n6. From 1993\u20132000 a food parcel distribution programme (cestas ba\u00b4sicas \u2013 PRODEA) was\ndesigned to provide for family needs for one month but was heavily criticized for being\nunashamedly clientelistic in its use for vote-capturing. In addition, smaller CCT projects\nhad been undertaken in a number of state capitals from 1995 (Graziano da Silva et al.,\n2005).\n7. Programa de Erradica\u02dco do Trabalho Infantil (Plan to Eradicate Child Labour).\n8. In 2000 the World Bank set up its Social Protection Unit within the Human Development\nNetwork. By 2005, social protection accounted for 12 per cent of total Bank lending, with\nUS$ 2.5 billion invested in forty-five projects around the globe (World Bank, 2005).\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia: A Double-edged Sword? 805\nto a number of serious problems with the programme. The sub-projects\noperated independently of each other with no overall co-ordination, separate\nadministrative structures, beneficiary selection methods, reporting proce-\ndures and banking arrangements.9 The unified data base inherited from the\nprevious administration covered only 70 per cent of beneficiaries, resulting\nin widely acknowledged targeting errors and omissions, duplication and high\nimplementation costs. Furthermore, there were widespread accusations of\npolitical manipulation in the selection of beneficiaries, harking back to the\nearlier cesta ba\u00b4sica food distribution scheme of the 1990s. A new approach\nwas urgently required.\nBOLSA FAMI\u00b4LIA IS BORN\nWith its credibility in the fight against hunger and poverty seriously\nundermined, in October 2003 the four separate schemes were unified under\nthe new label of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia (Family Grant), now the largest CCT pro-\ngramme in the world.10 In 2006, the existing PETI anti-child labour scheme\nwas added. Aside from strengthening administrative and targeting efficiency,\nit was hoped that this fusion would enhance synergies and complementar-\nities at the family level in schooling, health and nutrition. Conditionalities\nfor these three aspects were merged while unit benefits were increased. The\nhousehold was defined as the operational unit and the female head became\nthe targeted beneficiary. In January 2004, the Ministry of Food Security and\nFight against Hunger was merged with the Ministry of Social Welfare to\nform the Ministry of Social Development and Fight against Hunger (MDS).\nJose\u00b4 Graziano da Silva was replaced by Patrus Ananias as Minister of Social\nDevelopment and the Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia management unit was transferred from\nthe President\u2019s Office to the MDS to facilitate integration and co-ordination.\nBolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia targets two groups on the basis of self-declared household\nincome: the \u2018very poor\u2019 with a monthly income of up to R$ 60 (US$ 36) and\nthe \u2018poor\u2019 earning between R$ 60.01 and R$ 120 (US$ 73) a month.11 The\nextremely poor now receive a flat payment of R$ 58 (US$ 35) per month\nregardless of household composition. Both groups have been eligible for\nmonthly payments per child up to fifteen years of age to a maximum of three\nchildren. In December 2007 this limit was extended to include another two\nchildren per family up to age seventeen. The maximum monthly stipend per\nfamily now stands at R$ 172 (about US$ 104), although some families still\n9.

The food card system\nCarta\u02dco Alimentac\u00b8a\u02dco was introduced in the Northeast, Brazil\u2019s poorest re-\ngion, providing a further monthly supplement of R$ 50 (US$ 30) for basic\nfood purchases. Although these payments may seem modest to the outside\nobserver, they nevertheless represent a substantial boost to the household\nincomes of large sections of Brazil\u2019s poorest groups.13\nFollowing the restructuring of Brazil\u2019s safety net programmes, interna-\ntional support was rapidly forthcoming. A few months later in June 2004,\nthe World Bank approved a US$ 572 million sector-wide loan to support\nBolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia. It provides funding for cash transfers (96 per cent) as well\nas technical assistance to develop a unified database, improve targeting, de-\nvelop a system for monitoring and evaluation and strengthen institutional\ncapacity within the MDS (World Bank, 2004). Later that year, the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank (IDB) approved a loan of US$ 1 billion for\nthe programme, with a promise of up to twice this amount depending on\nprogress (IDB, 2004). These two commitments totalling US$ 2.57 billion\nrepresent almost one-quarter of the estimated funding of R$ 23 billion for\nBolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia during the first Lula administration of 2003\u201306 (Table 1).\nBy any standards this is a very firm international endorsement of the CCT\napproach to poverty reduction in Brazil.\nAchievements\nIn numerical terms, the achievements of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia are impressive.\nFigure 2 shows the steady rise in numbers of beneficiaries from 2001\nto 2007. By the end of 2006, the programme had met its target of at-\ntending to the needs of 11.1 poor families or some 44 million Brazilians\n(MDS, 2007). While numerically impressive, however, the latest figures\nshow that this equates to just 40 per cent of the eligible population (Soares\net al., 2007). According to MDS data, in June 2006 alone, just three\nmonths before the Presidential elections, 1.8 million families joined the pro-\ngramme, concentrated in the more deprived Northeast of the country (FSP,\n2006c).14 Over half of these recruits had received no other federal transfers\n12. http:\/\/www.mds.gov.br\/ (accessed 23 May 2008)\n13. Stipends in Brazil are comparable with CCT payments in other countries such as Mexico\nand Colombia (de la Brie`re and Rawlings, 2006).\n14. This was facilitated by increasing the qualifying household income level from R$ 100 to\nR$ 120 and updating of the municipal database of eligible families (FSP, 2006c).\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia: A Double-edged Sword? 807\nFigure 2.

Furthermore, the average level of benefit paid per household\nalmost tripled from R$ 28 to R$ 75 per month from 2003\u201305 (Brazil,\n2005a).\nAccording to the World Bank, Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia is not only the largest but\nalso the best targeted CCT scheme in Latin America, with 73 per cent of\nbenefits reaching the poorest 20 per cent of the population, and 94 per cent\nfalling within the lowest two quintiles (FAO, 2006).15 Many which had in\nthe past often been excluded from receiving social benefits such as street\ndwellers, quilombola16 communities and even indigenous groups have also\nbeen drawn into the safety net for the first time.\nNotwithstanding the more outlandish claims by some politicians and\npolicy-makers, the evidence suggests that in Brazil CCT programmes have\nbeen effective in helping to reduce poverty and inequality. The first par-\ntial evaluations of direct impacts produced mixed results. A study was\nmade in four north-eastern municipalities over eighteen months of the\nimpact of Bolsa Alimentac\u00b8a\u02dco, which gives mothers a stipend of R$ 25\n15.

It was\nfound that the project had strengthened the food security and nutritional\nstatus of mothers and children compared with non-participants (Brazil,\n2004).\nAnother investigation into the early Bolsa Escola (School Grant) com-\nponent when it was implemented in selected municipalities in the 1990s\nfound that it improved school attendance and had a minor but positive im-\npact on poverty levels (Bourguignon et al., 2003). However, the scheme\nhad no significant effect on child labour as the economic incentive was\nperceived by families as being too small (Cardoso and Souza, 2003). Fur-\nther research concluded that Bolsa Escola, which is aimed at children aged\nsix to fifteen years, had been poorly targeted. Most dropping out starts at\nage fourteen, the study concluded, and it would thus be in the fourteen\nto seventeen age group in which a cash incentive could be most effec-\ntive in retaining children at school (Schwartzman, 2005). This error has\nnow been corrected with the inclusion of adolescents up to the age of\nseventeen.\nA process evaluation of Bolsa Escola, as it was implemented during\n2004 in four states of Northeast Brazil in 261 municipalities, revealed the\nhighly variable record of local authorities in terms of operational efficiency\n(de Janvry et al., 2005). While there is no information on impacts as such,\nthe assessment was quite positive in terms of the transparency of procedures\nadopted for beneficiary screening and selection, although it was also found\nthat this did not necessarily lead to greater accountability.\nA more recent and comprehensive baseline study commissioned by the\nWorld Bank found that Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia produced no major variations in\nconsumption levels in the sample group but noted increased consumption of\nfood, educational materials and children\u2019s clothing (Soares et al., 2007).17\nOther results include a 3.6 per cent increase in school attendance and a lower\ndrop-out rate amongst beneficiaries. However, there was found to have been\nlittle impact on child nutrition, especially in the critical twelve to thirty-six\nmonth age group. Labour market participation was also found on average to\nbe 2.6 per cent higher amongst Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia participants, and 4.3 per cent\nhigher amongst women. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the programme\nhas given a significant boost to the local economies of areas which benefit\nfrom these cash transfers (IPEA, 2008). There are, therefore, some promising\nindications that the programme could have more beneficial economic spin-\noff than is sometimes assumed. It has also been strongly suggested that\nthe success of Bolsa Familia in reaching the poorest sectors resulted in a\n17. The same study notes, however, that this appears to have been at the expense of health items\nand adults\u2019 clothing purchases. The evaluation, carried out by CEDEPLAR of the Federal\nUniversity of Minas Gerais, administered 15,240 questionnaires in 269 municipalities\n(MDS, 2007).\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia: A Double-edged Sword? 809\none-third reduction in land invasions by the MST landless movement during\nPresident Lula\u2019s first administration.18\nIn addition, there is evidence that cash transfer programmes have helped\nreduce levels of income inequality in Brazil. One major study noted that\ndeclining levels of poverty and inequality in Brazil since the 1980s are in\npart associated with the spread of non-contributory rural pensions and other\ncash-based social assistance programmes (Menezes-Filho andVasconcellos,\n2007). Independent research evidence from Sa\u02dco Paulo also found that\nCCTs, including Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia, have been effective in targeting the poorest\ngroups.19 Since the 1990s there has been a gradual fall in the proportion of the\npopulation considered poor, but the drop has been especially marked since\n2003 with the establishment of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia. From 2003 to 2005, there\nwas a fall in absolute poverty in Brazil of over 19 per cent. Furthermore,\nfrom 2001 to 2004, the poorest 10 per cent of Brazilians enjoyed an increase\nin household income of 23.5 per cent, while the richest experienced a drop\nof 7.5 per cent. Based on household survey data, it has been estimated that\nincome inequality in Brazil fell by 4 per cent from 2001\u201304 (IPEA, 2006b).\nFurthermore, it is claimed that between 1995 and 2004, CCTs have helped\nreduce the Gini coefficient of income inequality by 21 per cent, comparable\nwith results obtained by similar programmes in Mexico and Chile (Soares\net al., 2007). These changes have been attributed to a number of factors\nincluding lower inflation rates, increases in the legal minimum wage and\npensions indexed to the minimum wage as well as to the effects of targeted\nsafety nets such as Bolsa Familia (IPEA, 2006b; Neri, 2006).\nNotwithstanding this cautiously constructive judgement, the same study\nshed light on a number of operational problems with Bolsa Escola that\nhave subsequently appeared in connection with the wider Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia\nprogramme. Clear evidence was found of political manipulation, with over\na quarter of members of \u2018social control councils\u2019 (conselhos) themselves\nbeing direct beneficiaries of the programme, implying a major conflict of\ninterest.20 Furthermore, in 10 per cent of municipalities surveyed, one or\nmore members of the legislature were programme beneficiaries, giving rise\nto the conclusion that, \u2018mayors used the Bolsa Escola program in exchange\nfor support in the legislative branch. . .(and). . .the allocation of these bolsas\nis used as an explicit element of clientelism and political rents\u2019 (de Janvry\net al., 2005: 29\u201330). The same study found that one-fifth of municipalities\n18. According to research carried out by the State University of Sa\u02dco Paulo, the number of\nfamilies involved in land occupations by the MST (Movimento dos Trabalhadoes Rurais\nSem Terra) fell from 65,552 in 2003 to 44,364 in 2006 (FSP, 2007c; IPEA, 2008).\n19. Primary data collected by CEBRAP revealed that 95 per cent of CCT beneficiaries in Sa\u02dco\nPaulo came from the poorest sectors (Figueiredo et al., 2006).\n20. These conselhos were set up at municipal level to monitor implementation of social pro-\ngrammes and induce a degree of transparency and accountability. They comprise represen-\ntatives from the community and authorities and in many instances members are nominated\nby the mayor, to whom they are not infrequently related (de Janvry et al., 2005).\n810 Anthony Hall\nsampled had no council to monitor activities, despite the fact that this was a\nlegal requirement.\nMonitoring of adherence to conditionalities has also been a contentious\nissue. In order to be effective in strengthening human capital, CCT benefits\nare contingent upon mothers meeting their obligations by sending their chil-\ndren regularly to school as well as undergoing health screening and receiv-\ning vaccinations, etc. Without such reciprocity, it could be argued that cash\ntransfers are merely a form of thinly disguised charity designed primarily to\ncapture votes. It is claimed in official figures that 80 per cent of Bolsa Escola\nrecipients are monitored for school attendance and that a 97 per cent success\nrate has been registered, although the evidence is mixed.21 In contrast, just\n42 per cent of adherence to health conditionalities has been tracked (IPEA,\n2008). Independent research notes that school teachers have been reluctant\nto register absentee pupils, although this has improved more recently under\nBolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia (de Janvry et al., 2005). Social councils have been unwilling\nto perform a policing role, especially where their independence is compro-\nmised by local personal and political links. One independent study was quite\ncategorical in its assessment of this aspect of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia: \u2018The federal\ngovernment is unable to supervise the behaviour of poor families through-\nout the country; local governments and municipalities are either inefficient\nor tied up with local elites, or both; and community grassroots organiza-\ntions are easily captured by political parties and movements\u2019 (Schwartzman,\n2005: 25). It is hoped that further evaluation will shed light on whether such\nobligations and the transaction costs involved are eventually reflected in a\nstrengthening of human development indicators.\nA major objective of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia is to target women and children more\ndirectly to ensure that they secure maximum benefit; hence the policy of\nchannelling cash transfers through female heads of household. The baseline\nstudy quoted above notes some subtle changes in household dynamics as\na consequence (MDS, 2007; IPEA, 2008). It is claimed that women have\nbecomemore \u2018empowered\u2019 through the increase in purchasing power gained\nand have thus experienced a strengthening of their authority in the household.\nMoreover, women participants consider that their citizenship rights have\nbeen strengthened as a result of having gone through the process of acquiring\nthe official papers (such as an identity card or birth certificate) necessary to\nregister for the programme.\nBOLSA FAMI\u00b4LIA IN CONTEXT\nOperational questions aside, there are wider issues to be considered relating\nto the effectiveness of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia in seriously challenging poverty in\nsuch an unequal society. Major questions to be considered include: (i) the\n21. This is based on a minimum attendance rate of 85 per cent of the time.\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia: A Double-edged Sword? 811\nshort- to medium-term poverty impact of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia; (ii) use of CCTs as\nan instrument of political clientelism and patronage; (iii) growing economic\ndependence of the poor on government handouts, together with a lack of\nintegration between CCTs and employment creation; and (v) the possible\nopportunity costs in terms of reduced longer-term human capital and social\ninvestment.\nPoverty and Inequality\nAlthough further evaluation evidence is needed to assess poverty impacts in\ngreater detail, the popular enthusiasm which has greeted the programme tes-\ntifies clearly to the fact that it has boosted household incomes of those on the\nlowest rungs of the social ladder. In Sa\u02dco Paulo, survey data for 2004 revealed\nthat 19 per cent of the population had access to CCTs, which accounted for\n21 per cent of household income amongst the poorest groups (Figueiredo et\nal., 2006). This is an especially significant contribution to people\u2019s liveli-\nhoods as urban employment is becoming increasingly informal, irregular\nand diversified. In Northeast Brazil, one-third of all households receive cash\ntransfers, including Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia, a figure which rises to 44 per cent in rural\nareas.\nIt has been suggested that Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia and other CCTs may thus be\ncontributing to a gradual reduction in absolute levels of poverty. One study\nindicated that 35 per cent of the drop in income inequality in Brazil ob-\nserved between 2001 and 2004 was attributable to the expansion of cash\ntransfer programmes (IPEA, 2006b). This may in part be attributable to more\nrecent programmes such as Bolsa Escola and Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia. However, the\nintroduction in 1991 of non-contributory pensions (worth a full minimum\nsalary, substantially more than CCT payments) has probably had a more\nsubstantial anti-poverty impact (Menezes-Filho and Vasconcellos, 2007).\nNevertheless, evaluation results from comparable CCT programmes such\nas Oportunidades in Mexico (the second largest in the world after Bolsa\nFam\u0131\u00b4lia) strongly suggest that, if properly implemented, they are an effec-\ntive instrument for reducing absolute poverty and improving some social\nindicators in a relatively short space of time.22\nYet the redistributive potential of CCTs such as Brazil\u2019s must be kept\nwithin a realistic perspective. Brazil has the seventh most unequal income\ndistribution in the world, in which the top 20 per cent of the population\nearns almost two-thirds of personal income and the bottom quintile just\n2.3 per cent (Paes de Barros and Carvalho, 2003). Although a drop in income\n22. Initiated in 1997, Progresa\/Oportunidades has been successful in reducing household\npoverty, boosting school enrolments and reducing dropouts, stimulating higher levels of\nhousehold consumption, improving child nutrition and cutting child labour (de Britto, 2008;\nMolyneux, 2006; Skoufias, 2005).\n812 Anthony Hall\ninequality was registered from 2001 to 2004 in Brazil, as noted above, there\nhas been a steady rise in urban poverty since the 1990s. In 1995 some 13 per\ncent of the urban population lived in absolute poverty, rising to 15 per cent\nin 2004 (Torres et al., 2006).23 Some 40 per cent of Brazilians (72 million\npeople of a total 184 million) are classed as still living below the unofficial\npoverty line of one-half of the legal minimum salary (Jaccoud, 2006).24\nSome economists argue that increases in the legal minimum wage across\nthe board are far more effective than targeted cash transfers in attacking\npoverty. One study concluded that wage rises and employment generation\nhad accounted for 78 per cent of the reduction in income inequality in\nBrazil from 1995 to 2004, while income transfer programmes accounted\nfor the remaining 22 per cent, with Bolsa Familia alone responsible for\nthree-quarters of this reduction (Soares et al., 2006).\nAs far as poverty alleviation in the longer-term is concerned, a major criti-\ncism of cash transfers is that on their own they have a limited impact because\nthey are channelled into basic consumption and do not boost income-earning\ncapacity or household assets. This is probably true of the vast majority of\nCCTs around the globe, including Brazil\u2019s, although exceptions have been\nnoted in the cases of Mexico and Chile, for example (Rawlings, 2004). Re-\nformers aiming to strengthen the impact of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia should examine\nexperiences in other countries where this challenge has been addressed. In\nBangladesh, for example, BRAC\u2019s \u2018Targeting the Ultra-poor\u2019 (TUP) pro-\ngramme launched in 2002 adopts a livelihoods perspective. Building upon\nearlier social protection programmes, it now combines a one-off transfer\nwith asset-building activities and economic promotion schemes (Hulme and\nMoore, 2008).\nPoliticization of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia\nTargeted safety nets are conventionally treated as a tool of technocratic plan-\nning but it is widely recognized that in practice they have a strong political\ndimension. This has been underlined as a perfectly rational course of ac-\ntion, since \u2018a policymaker who accurately takes into account the reaction of\nvoters to targeting can always do better than one who ignores electoral pol-\nitics\u2019 (Pritchett, 2005: 4). It is openly acknowledged even by President Lula\nhimself that his electoral triumph in 2006 to win a second term was due in\nlarge measure to the success of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia. In the run-up to the election,\npublic opinion polls consistently showed that his popularity was growing\nfastest amongst populations benefiting from the programme; that is, among\n23. Absolute poverty is defined in this source as a per capita income of up to half of the\nminimum salary. Brazil\u2019s ten largest metropolitan regions were covered in the survey.\n24. As of 1 March 2008, the legal minimum salary stood at R$ 415 (US$ 251) per month.\nFigures are based on data from the National Household survey (PNAD).\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia: A Double-edged Sword? 813\nthe poorest groups generally, and especially in the Northeast.25 There was a\nlarge expansion of the programme just three months before the election in\norder to meet the final target of over eleven million households.26 Unsur-\nprisingly, cases were reported in the press of the scheme being unashamedly\nused by local authorities for vote-capturing purposes.27\nThis particularly strong political support for Lula amongst Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia\nbeneficiaries was confirmed in subsequent voting patterns in October 2006.\nIn northeast Brazil, where up to half of households receive Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia\nstipends in some areas, the President won between 56 and 80 per cent\nof the vote by state, surpassing levels of support gained in 2002 (FSP,\n2006e; Power, 2006). Indeed, so popular is the scheme that even opposition\npoliticians vehemently supported Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia, promising to expand it\nfurther still should they be victorious.28 For any contender to openly criticize\nBolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia during campaigning would have constituted an act of political\nsuicide.\nLula has played the populist card well, identifying himself with Bolsa\nFam\u0131\u00b4lia and portraying it as his personal \u2018gift\u2019 to the deprived, claiming\nthat \u2018never has a government concerned itself so much with the poor\u2019 (FSP,\n2006d). This tactic may well have been essential for the President to capture\nvotes in the context of the decline in popularity of the Workers\u2019 Party (PT)\nin the wake of several corruption scandals. This drove Lula to bypass the\nparty structure and appeal directly to the poor, distancing himself from an\nincreasingly discredited PT. In the words of one political scientist, this was\na logical strategy to compensate for \u2018the absence of a political project struc-\ntured within social movements and mass organisations which has sustained\nthe PT since its foundations\u2019 (Flynn, 2005: 1245). The President\u2019s humble\norigins in the Northeast and role as a workers\u2019 leader, his personal charisma\nand popular appeal, together with his formidable communications skills,\nmade such a choice that much more feasible.\nIt is hardly surprising that CCT programmes such as Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia should\nbe politicized in view of their ability to rapidly benefit large and electorally\nimportant sectors of the population. Indeed, this broad principle applies not\n25. As early as eight months before the October 2006 presidential election, Datafolha polls\nregistered a rise in electoral support for Lula to 48 per cent, just as Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia was being\nexpanded to reach its target population of forty-four million. In the poor Northeast region,\nsupport for Lula stood at 55 per cent, compared with 29 per cent in the wealthier Southeast\nof the country. While Lula had an eight point lead in the polls in the Northeast overall, he\nenjoyed a twenty-one point advantage among Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia beneficiaries (FSP, 2006b).\n26. In June 2006 alone, about 1.8 million families (around 16 per cent of the total target) joined\nthe scheme, one million of whom had received no cash transfers previously. Most were\nrecruited from Sa\u02dco Paulo and the more northerly states of Bahia, Pernambuco, Ceara\u00b4 and\nMaranha\u02dco as well as Minas Gerais (FSP, 2006c).\n27. In one town the mayor sent a letter to all Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia recipients explaining that this was\na personal initiative of the president himself (FSP, 2006a).\n28. For example, Lula\u2019s main opponent in 2006, Geraldo Alkmin (PSDB), while campaigning\nin the Northeast, declared his unqualified support for Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia (ESP, 2006b).\n814 Anthony Hall\njust to developing countries but also to higher income, industrialized nations\nwhere the politicization and institutionalization of welfare provisioning on\nthe policy agenda is generally welcomed as a sign of progress. Indeed,\n\u2018politicized\u2019 social policy, especially where it contains a strong redistributive\nelement, may help stimulate economic growth and consolidate democracy\nthrough the social inclusion of traditionally ignored poorer groups. Be that\nas it may, however, a key question in the context of developing countries\nconcerns the nature of this process and in what ways the politicization of\nsocial policy, CCTs in this case, might serve to actually undermine longer-\nterm policy formulation and planning.\nIn the case of Brazil, the sheer popularity of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia could serve to\npromote a short-term perspective among politicians and policy makers, en-\ncouraging them to employ it primarily as a relatively inexpensive yet highly\neffective mechanism for capturing votes. As discussed below, some critics\naccuse Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia of encouraging a \u2018culture of dependence\u2019 amongst the\npoor. In turn, there is a corresponding danger that longer-term policy prior-\nities for investing in basic social infrastructure, especially in key areas such\nas education and health, might suffer. There could be a financial opportunity\ncost if resources are switched from social investments to income transfers,\nalthough this remains to be clearly demonstrated, as noted below.\nA \u2018Culture of Dependence\u2019?\nThe effectiveness of CCT programmes such as Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia in reduc-\ning poverty in the short term must be set against the inherent dangers of\nencouraging further dependence of the poor on government handouts and\ntransfers. The potential political leverage available through cash transfers is\nunderlined by the fact that average total monthly payments through Bolsa\nFam\u0131\u00b4lia now amount to almost R$ 900 million or US$ 545 million (FSP, 18\nMarch 2008). Some municipalities rely on the programme for up to 40 per\ncent of their overall budgets, with such dependence being especially strong\nin poorer north-eastern districts (Marques, 2005). Patrus Ananias, the Min-\nister of Social Development, even accused some mayors of establishing a\n\u2018poverty industry\u2019. That is, they would refrain from imposing local land and\nhousing taxes in order to retain popular support, confident that the federal\ngovernment would make up any budget deficit via cash transfers of various\nkinds, including CCTs (ESP, 2006a).\nNot just mayors but also individuals and households appear to be in-\ncreasingly dependent on federal transfers, including on CCTs. Longitudinal\nstudies of the labour market and household incomes in Sa\u02dco Paulo have re-\nvealed the growing informalization of employment in Brazil\u2019s largest city\n(Figueiredo et al., 2005). In 1991, 54 per cent of workers were formally\nregistered, compared with only 30 per cent in 2004, while the informal sec-\ntor doubled in size to 51 per cent over the same period. Even at that stage,\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia: A Double-edged Sword? 815\nthe CCT precursors of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia, as noted above, accounted for 21 per\ncent of family income amongst the poorest sectors in Sa\u02dco Paulo. In 1995\naccording to census data, earnings from employment accounted for almost\n90 per cent of household income in Brazil but by 2004 this figure had fallen\nto 48 per cent (FSP, 2005). In other words, Brazil\u2019s poorest families now\nderive over half their income from federal, largely non-contributory cash\ntransfers, including Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia and rural pensions.\nIn the face of continued high structural unemployment amongst the poor\nthis trend may be inevitable and will be reversed only when the economy is\nable to generate more jobs. It does not follow, therefore, that cash transfers\nare necessarily displacing paid work and encouraging \u2018idleness\u2019. In fact,\nthree-quarters of those in receipt of income transfers in Brazil are employed\n(\u2018economically active\u2019), an almost identical proportion to that of the wider\npopulation. However, unemployment is significantly higher amongst cash\ntransfer recipients in urban areas (Jaccoud, 2006).29 The targeted andmeans-\ntested nature of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia could certainly stimulate a move towards\ninformal employment since to accept paid formal jobs could disqualify\nbeneficiaries.30 In order to discourage such a trend and reinforce formal\nemployment, there is thus an argument in favour of universalizing Bolsa\nFam\u0131\u00b4lia and removing the means-tested element, as noted in the conclusions\nbelow.\nHarsher critics have labelled Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia\/Bolsa Escola as \u2018Bolsa\nEsmola\u2019 (\u2018charity\u2019 or \u2018alms\u2019) on the grounds that such transfers, especially\nwhere conditionalities are only loosely monitored, are merely an exercise\nin paternalism which encourages clientelism and manipulation for electoral\nends. This would encourage the use of CCTs for short-term political gain and\nbelie their supposed \u2018social risk management\u2019 aim to address longer-term\ndevelopment challenges through investment in livelihoods and the enhance-\nment of human capital. This is not to say that short-term political aims and\nlonger-run development objectives are necessarily incompatible. However,\nthe temptation is to spend heavily on interventions to reward households for\ntheir immediate partisan support rather than investing in activities whose\nbenefits will become apparent only several years down the line, well past\nthe election date, and for which another political leader may even eventually\nclaim credit.\n29. Household survey (PNAD) data for 2001\u201304 reveal that formal employment amongst the\ngeneral population stands at 28 per cent, compared with 15 per cent for cash transfer\nrecipients. Informal and other forms of self-employment account for 40 per cent of the\ngeneral labour force, but 64 per cent amongst income transfer beneficiaries (Jaccoud,\n2006).\n30. Anecdotal evidence suggests that temporary rural workers in particular are reluctant to\nbecome registered and receive a legal minimum salary for a few months a year since\nunder current regulations this would disqualify them from receiving Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia benefits\naltogether. See FSP (2007b).\n816 Anthony Hall\nThe \u2018social riskmanagement\u2019 approach to safety nets requires that \u2018spring-\nboards\u2019 be created to go beyond the provision of short-term relief, enhancing\npeople\u2019s livelihoods and creating jobs (World Bank, 2000). However, CCTs\nhave not been very successful to date in forging links with productive em-\nployment. Some programmes have adopted a more integrated approach as\nin Nicaragua, Mexico and Chile\u2019s Programa Puente, as well as in some\nstate-level programmes in Brazil itself (Hall, 2006; Rawlings, 2004). The\nlonger-term success of CCTs in fighting poverty, it is recognized, \u2018depends\non insertion into the wider economy, notably through rural employment and\nlabor market policies\u2019 (de la Brie`re and Rawlings, 2006: 25). Social protec-\ntion and transfer payments \u2018can be growth-promoting where, for instance, it\nstimulates thrift and credit schemes, creates physical assets through employ-\nment schemes, and promotes personal insurance\u2019 (Farrington et al., 2004: v).\nThe notion of \u2018Transformative Social Protection\u2019 argues that social policies\ncan be a powerful tool for strengthening livelihoods (IDS, 2006). However,\nthis remains to be demonstrated in the case of CCTs such as Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia.\nSocial Investment\nSince its inception in 2003, Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia has absorbed a small but growing\nproportion of Brazil\u2019s overall social spending. Although this remains modest\nat just under 3 per cent, there is a risk that the imperative to make short-\nterm electoral gains could compromise longer-term social investments in key\nareas such as education, health and sanitation. The emphasis on strengthening\ndemand by the poor for health and education will not necessarily lead to\nan improvement in the supply or quality of these services, especially as\npublic provision is frequently unresponsive to such pressures (Farrington\nand Slater, 2006). Furthermore, eventual success in strengthening human\ncapital through Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia might be used perversely to actually justify\nlower levels of investment into basic education and health infrastructure\nin future on the grounds that poverty and inequality can be tackled most\neffectively through safety nets (Handa and Davis, 2006).\nIndependent research indicates that the notable expansion in non-\ncontributory benefits in Brazil through CCTs and other welfare programmes\nhas been accompanied by a significant drop in longer-term social investment\nin several sectors. For example, between 2002 and 2004, federal spending\non basic sanitation and housing fell in real terms by 46 per cent. Over\nthe same period at state level, investment in education saw a reduction of\n12 per cent, housing by 14 per cent and basic sanitation by 18 per cent. Very\nsimilar results were recorded for social investments by municipal govern-\nments in terms both of overall as well as per capita spending (Lavinas et al.,\n2006). Other research noted that federal spending per capita between 2001\nand 2005 fell significantly in sanitation (44 per cent), health (7.49 per cent)\nand education (5.4 per cent) while social assistance for the poorest grew by\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia: A Double-edged Sword? 817\n11.11 per cent (Pochmann, 2005). It was concluded that: \u2018there has been\nno coordinated effort at federal or sub-national levels to provide essential\npublic services indispensable for the reduction of inequalities in lifestyle and\nimprovements in welfare alongside improvements in individual and family\nincome and consumption\u2019 (Lavinas et al., 2006: 7).\nIt is also significant that, in a round of government spending cuts in\nearly 2007, the Ministry of Social Development fared well. It maintained its\nbudget virtually intact, whereas others faced reductions of up to 77 per\ncent.31 This attests to the continuing high political importance attached to\ntargeted social safety nets in Brazil. Whether the promotion of such cash\nstipends induces spending cutbacks in longer-term social investments either\ndirectly or indirectly remains to be seen. Another moot point concerns the\nimpact of politically strategic CCTs such as Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia on the mind-set of\npolicy planners. There could be subtle but serious consequences for national\nprogress if short-term electoral preoccupations come to dominate thinking\nat the expense of pushing forward critical sector investment programmes\nessential for longer-term economic growth and social development. Cash\ntransfers can only complement and not substitute mainstream social provi-\nsioning. Moreover, they can themselves only function properly in terms of\nstrengthening demand for and democratizing access to basic social services\nsuch as education and health if the actual supply of such services is adequate\nin the first place.\nCONCLUSION\nBolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia and other conditional cash transfer programmes have been\nhailed by many policy makers as something of a \u2018magic bullet\u2019 for rapidly\nreducing levels of absolute poverty while attempting to improve social in-\ndicators through increasing the effective demand for education and health\ncare. Such schemes have proved extremely popular amongst national policy\nmakers of all ideological persuasions due to the electoral support which can\nbe harnessed. Furthermore, programmes which are apparently effective in\nattacking urban poverty, especially those which help keep poor children in\nschool, are likely to gain the approval of wealthier citizens concerned with\npersonal and public security. CCTs have also attracted growing technical and\nfinancial support from international donors as they appear to offer a \u2018win\u2013\nwin\u2019, highly visible and relatively conflict-free approach for addressingmass\npoverty.\nYet, as we have seen, there are inherent dangers which threaten to un-\ndermine the longer-term effectiveness and viability of CCTs as a means of\n31. The Ministry of Social Development suffered a cut of just 2.5 per cent, compared with\nTourism (77 per cent), Cities (59 per cent), Agriculture (45 per cent), Transport (23 per\ncent), Defence (17 per cent) and Justice (19 per cent). See FSP (2007a).\n818 Anthony Hall\naddressing deep-seated poverty and deprivation. These risks include opera-\ntional problems of targeting and general effectiveness in reducing poverty,\nthe quest for short-term political advantage at the expense of longer-run\ninvestment into social infrastructure, a lack of integration with labour mar-\nkets, and the resulting creation of a dependency culture which might further\nencourage clientelism in the distribution of benefits and informalization of\nthe labour market itself.\nInsofar as safety nets are considered a valuable tool of social policy, critics\nhave argued for a more radical approach. For example, it has been suggested,\nbased on the experience of OECD countries, that economic development in\nthe South could be supported through the adoption of more universal, social\ninsurance and tax-financed group schemes which are not means-tested or\nselective (Townsend, 2004, 2007). Revenues to finance such an expansion\nwould be raised through international taxation, and would help to eliminate\ninequalities between industrialized and poor countries. 32\nIn Brazil more specifically, campaigners have long argued that income and\ncash transfers should be provided unconditionally as part of a universal basic\nincome for all Brazilian citizens (Schwartzman, 2005; Suplicy, 2004). In fact,\nas the result of persistent campaigning by Eduardo Suplicy, senator for the\nstate of Sa\u02dco Paulo, in 2004 Brazil legalized the concept of a universal basic\nincome for all its citizens, the only such instance in the world apart from the\nUS state of Alaska.33 Paradoxically, however, the law retains the principle\nof selectivity to favour the neediest and there is no specified deadline for the\nimplementation of universal coverage. In practice, CCT programmes such\nas Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia are portrayed as the first step in this direction. However,\nit is generally accepted that there is little prospect of the final destination\nbeing reached in the foreseeable future.\nSenator Suplicy has suggested that a citizen\u2019s income in accordance with\nthe new law be provided to all members of the eleven million families\npresently eligible for benefits under Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia, a form of selective or\nstratified universality. However, this would result in a quintupling of the\nprogramme budget. Another proposal is for a universal benefit of R$ 80\n(US$ 48) per month for all of Brazil\u2019s sixty million or so children up to\nthe age of sixteen (Lavinas, 2006). This parallels similar proposals at the\ninternational level.34 It is thought that in Brazil such a scheme could be\nfunded largely from redirecting the existing social budget, at a total cost of\nR$ 18 billion. This would include Bolsa Familia, which cost R$ 8.2 billion\nin 2006 (and is expected to rise to R$ 11 billion in 2008).\n32. Such as the 1972 Tobin Tax on currency transfers (Townsend, 2007).\n33. Law 10,835 was ratified on 8 January 2004, after having spent eleven years going through\nCongress.\n34. Along similar but more ambitious lines, Townsend (2007, 2008) has suggested the progres-\nsive introduction of an international child benefit scheme. Starting with the poorest coun-\ntries, it would be funded through employer contributions to social insurance programmes\nin OECD nations and a currency transfer tax.\nBrazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia: A Double-edged Sword? 819\nThere are persuasive arguments in favour of moving towards a more\nuniversal, non-means-tested, rights-based system of cash stipends embracing\na much larger proportion of the relatively poor in specific categories, rather\nthan just the \u2018poorest of the poor\u2019, or even to the entire population. Thiswould\nhelp address problems inherent in CCTs, for example, of administrative\ncomplexity, high costs of mean-testing and monitoring compliance, and\nunfair distribution of benefits to less needy groups at the expense of the\npoorest.\nYet it is open to question whether such a universalistic approach would\nfind acceptance in Brazil, even if the additional funding could be found. In\nthe initial days of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia, for example, cash payments were seen as\nmore of a citizenship right or basic income approach and the monitoring\nof beneficiary adherence to conditionalities such as attendance at schools\nand health clinics was not strongly emphasized by the government, whether\nfor reasons of political expediency or ideological persuasion. However,\nthere was a strong backlash from the public, which \u2018repeatedly demanded\nthat tighter and more transparent procedures be used to screen potential\nbeneficiaries\u2019 (de Britto, 2008: 188). This reaction was presumably based on\nthe general fear that the \u2018undeserving\u2019 poor might benefit or that the system\nmight otherwise be abused.\nIn the meantime, Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia is likely to remain high on the social\npolicy agenda in Brazil. It is estimated, for example, that 60 per cent of the\neligible population remains untouched by the programme, leaving plenty of\nscope for expansion (Soares et al., 2007). There is thus little prospect at the\nmoment that it will lose popularity as a major instrument of social policy.\nIt serves the purpose of various domestic and international interests and,\nlike many social protection programmes, is subject to a high level of path\ndependence from which reformers might find it difficult to deviate.\nAs a double-edged sword, however, it could cut both ways. Notwithstand-\ning its obvious attractions, policy makers may well find that, in terms of\nattacking poverty and inequality, the longer-term costs of the world\u2019s largest\nCCT programme could outweigh its benefits. Forward-looking policy mak-\ners will be aware of these dangers and be considering how to build upon the\nprogress witnessed to date. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that future\nincarnations of Bolsa Fam\u0131\u00b4lia will have to seriously address the challenge\nof integrating the programme into a wider development strategy which seri-\nously attempts to link cash transfers more effectively with employment and\nincome-generating initiatives.\nREFERENCES\nAbel, C. and C.
