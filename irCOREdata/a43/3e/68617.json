We generalize Chirikov's resonance-overlap criterion for the onset of global\nchaos in Hamiltonian systems to describe the onset of chaotic attractors in weakly\ndissipative systems.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe celebrated Chirikov resonance-overlap criterion [1] is based on the idea that,\ngenerally, the onset of global chaos in Hamiltonian systems occurs due to strong\ninteractions between resonances of different orders (oscillations of different frequen-\ncies calculated in the resonance approximation). The behaviour of weakly dissipa-\ntive systems is quite similar to that one of non-dissipative ones. Thus it is natural\nto expect that there should exist a criterion for the onset of chaos, similar to the\nChirikov one, applicable in the case of weak dissipation.\nTo test this hypothesis we study as a simple example the tilted Duffing oscillator\n(TDO) driven by a periodic force in the presence of weak linear friction. In a certain\nrange of parameters, the TDO belongs to the class of so-called zero-dispersion (ZD)\nsystems [2] whose main characteristic property is an extremum in the dependence\nof the natural frequency w on energy E (Fig. 1). For present purposes, the TDO is\nparticularly convenient for two reasons: (i) it is a simple monostable system, so that\nperiodic driving does not result in complicated behavior related to the saddles of\nan undriven system; (ii) on account of the minimum in uj(E), overlap of resonances\nof different orders may occur at quite small amplitudes of the driving force, so that\none may expect that criteria based on the resonance approximation will work better\nthan in those cases that involve large amplitudes.\nCP502, Stochastic and Chaotic Dynamics in the Lakes: STOCHAOS,\nedited by D.

It possesses attractors most of which corre-\nspond approximately to resonant eigenoscillations1 i.e. to eigenoscillations at ac-\ntions Ir (or energies Er) satisfying the resonance condition\nnuj(Ir) = (5)\nThat is why we refer to such attractors and their basins as nth-order resonances.\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2\nFIGURE 2. The bifurcation diagram for the reduced system (2),(3) at n = 1,2 for the potential\nU(q) as in Fig. 1 with F = 0.05. The region where two attractors at n = 1 coexist is limited by\ndotted lines. There are two (one) attractor(s) corresponding to n = 2 between inner (inner and\nouter) full lines. The dashed line marks the NR\/ZDNR transition at n=2 (see Fig. 3).\nFIGURE 3. Typical evolution of three 2?r bands of the phase space structure for the reduced\nsystem (2),(3) at n = 2, with the same parameters as in Fig. 2 and cj\/ = 0.95 as h increases from\n(a) 0.055 to (b) 0.075; note that the phase space is periodic in angle, with a period of 2?r but,\nin the interest of clarity, we draw only three 2?r bands. Dots and open circles mark attractors\nand saddles respectively. Trajectories coming to\/from saddles are drawn as full\/dotted lines.\nTrajectories coming to saddles form the boundaries of the basins of attraction.\n1) Other attractors, if they exist, correspond at least qualitatively to linear response (4).\n445\nFig. 2 presents the bifurcation diagrams for n = 1,2 in the relevant region of the\nh \u2014 LOf plane. Fig. 3 shows a typical evolution of the phase space structure at n = 2\nas the driving amplitude h increases: the transition from conventional nonlinear\nresonance (NR) to zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance (ZDNR) occurs [3]. It occurs\ndue to a saddle connection and results in a qualitative change of topology of the\nbasins: in NR (a), the basin of attraction of the smaller-action attractor embraces\nthe basin of the larger-action attractor, while it is other way round in ZDNR (b).\nCHAOS IN THE FULL SYSTEM AND AN\nINTERACTION BETWEEN RESONANCES\nIn contrast to the reduced systems (2),(3), the full system (1) has 1.5 degrees of\nfreedom and can be chaotic. Fig. 4 presents the bifurcation diagram for the system\n(1) together with lines found in the resonance approximation and lines related to the\ninteraction between resonances. There are two different types of chaotic attractor\n(c.f. Fig.5). The corresponding regions of parameters practically do not overlap.\nFor the sake of brevity, we refer to them as to chaos-1 and chaos-2.\nAs h increases, the chaotic attractor corresponding to chaos-1 (c.f. Fig. 5(a.7))\nis born via a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations from the larger-amplitude\nperiod-2 attractor (which corresponds to the larger-action 2nd-order resonance)\ndue to an increasing interaction with the larger-amplitude period-1 attractor (Ist-\norder resonance). With further increase of\/&, the chaotic attractor grows and, when\nh reaches the crisis line, the attractor touches the boundary of attraction of the\nIst-order resonance and vanishes discontinuously (Figs.5(a.8,9)).\nThe chaotic attractor corresponding to chaos-2 (c.f. Fig. 5(b.6)) is born via a se-\nquence of period-doubling bifurcations from the smaller-amplitude period-2 attrac-\ntor (the smaller-action 2nd-order resonance) due to an increasing interaction with\nthe smaller-amplitude period-1 attractor (linear response). With further increase\nof \/i, destruction of the chaotic attractor and a reverse sequence of period-doubling\nbifurcations occur (Figs.5(b.8,9)).\nIt is seen that the chaos-1 and chaos-2 regions can be roughly delineated us-\ning simple criteria related to interactions between oscillatory regimes of different\nfrequencies calculated either in the resonance or in linear response approximations.\nChaos-1 is bounded by the line 1-2-3-1. The line 1-2 corresponds to the Chirikov-\ntype overlap in energy between the larger-action 2nd-order resonance and the Ist-\norder nonlinear resonance. The relevance of this line reflects the fact that the origin\nof chaos-1 lies in a strong interaction between the larger-amplitude period-1 and\nperiod-2 regimes of oscillations (c.f. Figs.5(a.5-7)). The line 1-3 corresponds to\nthe lowest action on the boundary of the Ist-order nonlinear resonance becoming\nequal to action of the larger-action attractor of the 2nd-order resonance: this line\napproximately bounds the crisis of the chaotic attractor. The line 2-3 (NR\/ZDNR)\nbounds chaos-1 region from the right since, in the nearby parameter region, an\noverlap between the larger-action 2nd-order and Ist-order resonances is possible\n446\n5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5\nay\nFIGURE 4. The bifurcation diagram for the full system (1) at the same U(q) and F which are\nrelevant to Fig. 2. Various bifurcations, found from the analysis of Poincare sections, are indicated\nby thin full lines and by the corresponding labels. Regions where strange attractors exist well\nmatch those where positive Lyapunov exponents exist. The latter regions are shaded. To resolve\nthe two different types of chaotic attractors, we use different markers (circles and rhombuses)\nfor shading the corresponding regions; note that there is a slight overlap of the regions (where\nboth types of chaotic attractors coexist). Dotted lines are related to resonances n = 1,2. Thick\nfull lines are related to the interaction between oscillations of different frequencies, and their\nintersections are indicated by the arrows and corresponding numbers.\nonly in the ZDNR stage: in the NR stage, a basin of the larger-action 2nd-order\nresonance is encompassed by a basin of the smaller-action 2nd-order resonance (see\nFig. 3(a) and Fig. 5(a.3)) which prevents an overlap of the former basin with that\none of the Ist-order resonance. We note that, as the parameter \/? in U(q) (1)\ndecreases (so that the minimum of u(E) becomes shallower and then disappears\nat \/? \u00ab 0.562), an area of the delineated region quickly decreases until it vanishes,\nwhich correlates with a disappearance of chaos-1 at \/3 ~ 0.8.\nChaos-2 is bounded very roughly by the line 4-5-6-7-4. Though the delineation\nis much less accurate than for chaos-1 it still provides a good guess as to where\napproximately chaos-2 may be expected and, moreover, the shrinking of the delin-\neated region as 0 decreases describes quite well the shrinking of the chaos-2 area\nand its final disappearance at \/3 ~ 0.9. The line 4-7, bounding chaos-2 from the\nleft, is just the NR\/ZDNR line: in the region to the right of it, the larger-action\n447\n(a.4) h=0.061 (a.5) h=0.075 (a.6) h=0.10\n(a.7) h=0.113 (a.8) h=0.150 (a.9) h=0.20\n(b.5)h=0.086 (b.6)h=0.110\n(b.7) h=0.190 (b.8) h=0.215 (b.9) h=0.227\nFIGURE 5. An evolution of the stroboscopic (t \u2014 0, 2-7T,...) Poincare section p \u2014 q for: (a)\nUf = 0.95,(b) ujf = 1.05 as h increases: it demonstrates how chaos-l(a) and chaos-2(b) are born.\nAttractors are indicated by dots, basins of their attraction are shown by different shades.\n448\n2nd-order resonance does not prevent an interaction between the smaller-action\n2nd-order resonance and linear response. The lines 6-7 and 4-5 bound (from below\nand from above respectively) the region where both linear response and the smaller-\naction 2nd-order resonance are to occur in approximately one and the same energy\nrange: 6-7 and 4-5 correspond to equality of the energy of the attractor of the\n2nd-order resonance with the largest and smallest energies respectively of the lin-\near response. The line 5-6, roughly bounding chaos-2 from the right, is just the\nline Uf = 2a;0: nearly everywhere to the right of it, the smaller-action 2nd-order\nresonance is suppressed by linear response and, therefore, chaos cannot arise.\nFinally, we emphasize that our study is far from being complete: many details are\nyet to be clarified, the criteria are to be tested on other models. Most importantly,\nthe relationship of the area with chaotic attractors in the weakly dissipative case,\nto the area with global chaos in the non-dissipative case, needs to be studied.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is evident that chaos may occur in a weakly dissipative periodically driven\nmonostable system (TDO) at very low amplitudes of the driving force. We have\ndemonstrated that its onset\/disappearance may readily be interpreted in terms of\nan interaction between oscillation regimes of different frequencies calculated either\nin resonance approximation or linear response approximations. We hope that the\nabove criteria may apply generally to all weakly dissipative systems providing rather\na simple and convenient tool for the prediction of chaos analogous to that provided\nby the Chirikov-overlap criterion in non-dissipative systems. To understand the\ndeeper origins of the above criteria will require the involvement of mathematicians.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe research has been supported by INTAS and by the EPSRC (UK).\nREFERENCES\n1.
