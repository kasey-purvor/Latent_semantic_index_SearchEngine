Patients are managed by the integrated activities of clinical and non-clinical members of primary care\nteams. This study aimed to: investigate theoretically-based organisational, team, and individual factors determining\nthe multiple behaviours needed to manage diabetes; and identify multilevel determinants of different diabetes\nmanagement behaviours and potential interventions to improve them. This paper describes the instrument\ndevelopment, study recruitment, characteristics of the study participating practices and their constituent healthcare\nprofessionals and administrative staff and reports descriptive analyses of the data collected.\nMethods: The study was a predictive study over a 12-month period. Practices (N = 99) were recruited from within\nthe UK Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework. We identified six behaviours chosen to\ncover a range of clinical activities (prescribing, non-prescribing), reflect decisions that were not necessarily\nstraightforward (controlling blood pressure that was above target despite other drug treatment), and reflect\nrecommended best practice as described by national guidelines. Practice attributes and a wide range of\nindividually reported measures were assessed at baseline; measures of clinical outcome were collected over the\nensuing 12 months, and a number of proxy measures of behaviour were collected at baseline and at 12 months.\nData were collected by telephone interview, postal questionnaire (organisational and clinical) to practice staff,\npostal questionnaire to patients, and by computer data extraction query.\nResults: All 99 practices completed a telephone interview and responded to baseline questionnaires. The\norganisational questionnaire was completed by 931\/1236 (75.3%) administrative staff, 423\/529 (80.0%) primary care\ndoctors, and 255\/314 (81.2%) nurses. Clinical questionnaires were completed by 326\/361 (90.3%) primary care\ndoctors and 163\/186 (87.6%) nurses. At a practice level, we achieved response rates of 100% from clinicians in 40\npractices and > 80% from clinicians in 67 practices. All measures had satisfactory internal consistency (alpha\ncoefficient range from 0.61 to 0.97; Pearson correlation coefficient (two item measures) 0.32 to 0.81); scores were\ngenerally consistent with good practice. Measures of behaviour showed relatively high rates of performance of the\nsix behaviours, but with considerable variability within and across the behaviours and measures.\nDiscussion: We have assembled an unparalleled data set from clinicians reporting on their cognitions in relation\nto the performance of six clinical behaviours involved in the management of people with one chronic disease\n(diabetes mellitus), using a range of organisational and individual level measures as well as information on the\n* Correspondence: martin.eccles@ncl.ac.uk\n1Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Baddiley-Clark Building,\nRichardson Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4AX, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nEccles et al.

We would welcome\napproaches from other researchers to collaborate on the analysis of this data.\nBackground\nThere is an enduring interest in healthcare in how best\nto predictably improve the quality of care received by\npatients. Different researchers approach this issue in dif-\nferent ways using different methods informed by a range\nof disciplinary backgrounds. Implementation science is\nthe (usually multi-disciplinary) study of those factors\nthat promote the uptake of the findings of clinical\nresearch into routine healthcare, thereby improving care\nfor patients; it includes the study of both individual and\norganisational factors.\nWithin implementation science there has been\nincreasing interest in the role of theoretical models to\nunderstand behaviours and identify techniques to\nchange them. A systematic review of guideline imple-\nmentation studies concluded that, by 1998, only 14 of\n235 studies reported being inspired by or applying the-\nories [1]. Since then there has been a steady increase in\nthe number and type of studies testing or applying spe-\ncific theories. Systematic reviews have quantified the\nempirical support for or predictive validity of social cog-\nnitive theories in predicting behaviour [2], diagnostic\nstudies have explored a range of social cognitive, action\nand planning theories\u2019 prediction of intentions [3] and\nbehaviour [4-6] and, using the theory of Planned Beha-\nviour, have underpinned both intervention development\n[7] and process evaluation within randomised controlled\ntrials [8,9]. Given the multiplicity of theories, authors\nhave begun to offer various sorts of consolidated models\nthat draw on multiple theories [10,11].\nHowever, the reality of the efforts to explore these\nissues has been slower than anticipated due to factors\nsuch as the challenges of operationalising theories, the\nneed to characterise clinical care in terms of its consti-\ntuent behaviours, the challenges of measuring behaviour,\nand the tension between focussing on individuals per se\nor as constituent members of teams and organisations.\nOur previous work focussed on \u2018relatively simple\u2019 clin-\nical behaviours performed by individual healthcare pro-\nfessionals [4-6,12-16], but the majority of healthcare\ndelivered, at least in primary care in high income coun-\ntries, is for more complex behaviours involved in the\nmanagement of chronic diseases.\nGlobally, type 2 diabetes is an increasingly prevalent\nchronic illness and is an important cause of avoidable\nmortality. Despite guidelines defining standards of care\n(e.g., http:\/\/guidance.nice.org.uk\/CG\/Published), there is\nevidence of less than optimum care in a number of\nareas [17]. Whilst some of the variability in care will\nreflect variation in patient physiology and behaviour, it\nwill also reflect differences in the clinical management\nbehaviours of individual clinicians and the organisations\nthey work in. In the United Kingdom, patients are man-\naged by the integrated activities of clinical and non-clin-\nical members of primary care teams and therefore,\nwhilst clinicians still perform individual clinical beha-\nviours, process measures of care and patient outcomes\nreflect a complex mix of individual clinicians\u2019 behaviours\n(e.g., examining a patient\u2019s feet), sequential behaviours\nacross clinicians (e.g., managing a patient\u2019s blood pres-\nsure, BP), and sequential behaviours across administra-\ntive and clinical staff (e.g., taking a blood sample to\nassess glycaemic control and then adjusting medication\nif appropriate).\nThe \u2018Improving The Delivery Of Care For Patients\nWith Diabetes Through Understanding Optimised Team\nWork And Organisation In Primary Care\u2019 study-subse-\nquently shortened to \u2018Improving Quality of Care in Dia-\nbetes (iQuaD)\u2019 Study (see study protocol for further\ndetail [18])-aimed to investigate these issues. Designed\nas a predictive study (over 12 months), it aims to inves-\ntigate organisational, team, and individual factors deter-\nmining the multiple behaviours needed to manage\ndiabetes and identified multilevel determinants of differ-\nent diabetes management behaviours and potential\ninterventions to improve them. This paper describes the\ninstrument development, study recruitment, characteris-\ntics of the study participating practices and their consti-\ntuent healthcare professionals and administrative staff,\nand reports the descriptive analyses of the data\ncollected.\nMethods\nStudy design and overview\nThe study was a predictive study over a 12-month per-\niod. In summary, practice attributes and a wide range of\nindividually reported measures were measured at base-\nline; measures of clinical outcome were collected over\nthe ensuing 12 months, and a number of proxy mea-\nsures of behaviour were collected at 12 months (detailed\nin Table 1).\nAt baseline we collected:\n1.

In order to be able to describe, charac-\nterise, and explore whole primary care practices, we\nwanted to achieve as close as possible to a 100% team\nresponse rate for the survey instruments from each\npractice. MRC GPRF practices volunteer to be research\nactive and can directly receive funding to support their\nparticipation in research studies; practices were offered\nfull reimbursement for the staff time taken to complete\nall study activities (including questionnaire completion)\non condition that practice completion rates were\nsatisfactory.\nRecruitment was by postal invitation via the GPRF\nadministration, with telephone follow-up of interested\npractices by the study research associate. Participants\nwere all the clinical and non-clinical members of the\nprimary care team in the practices recruited to the\nstudy.\nClinical behaviours\nTo investigate the care offered to patients we identified\nsix clinical behaviours (Table 2) performed in the man-\nagement of patients with diabetes. These were chosen\nto: cover a range of clinical activities (prescribing, non-\nprescribing); reflect decisions that were not necessarily\nstraightforward (controlling BP that was above target\ndespite other drug treatment); and reflect recommended\nbest practice as described by national guidelines [19].\nThe behaviours were precisely specified (according to\nthe \u2018TACT\u2019 principle [20]: Target, Action, Context,\nTime or Who does What, Where and When) in order\nto provide consistency of measurement across practices\nand to reduce ambiguity when they were described to\nsurvey respondents.\nInstrument development and piloting\nTelephone Interview schedule\nA structured interview schedule was developed to collect\ndetails from a nominated study contact in each practice\nabout practices\u2019 structures and functions (see Additional\nFile 1) both in general and in relation to the provision\nof care for patients with type 2 diabetes. The content of\nthe interview schedule was informed by previous studies\n[21,22], current recommendations for best practice\n(relating to the organisation of care for people with type\n2 diabetes), and expert opinion. Minor amendments\nwere made after the first two practice interviews.\nBaseline postal questionnaire\nQuestionnaire development\nThe baseline questionnaire consisted of three sections.\nThe first section measured individuals\u2019 perceptions relat-\ning to team functioning and practice organisational\nbehaviour, and was to be answered by all members of\nthe practice. The second section covered cognitions\nabout performing the six different clinical behaviours,\nand was to be answered by those members of the prac-\ntice who provided care for patients with type 2 diabetes.\nThe third section comprised four clinical scenarios relat-\ning to patients with type 2 diabetes, and was to be\nanswered by the same group that answered the second\nsection.\nThe questions covering individuals\u2019 perceptions relat-\ning to team functioning and practice organisational\nbehaviour (Additional File 2, pages 1 to 8) comprised\nitems based on theoretical constructs within Exchange\nTheory [23,24], and based on the premise that fair orga-\nnisations produce well-functioning teams and good\nhealth outcomes for patients. The models were a num-\nber of existing validated scales: Organizational Justice\nEvaluation Scale [25,26], a shortened version of the\nTeam Climate Inventory [27], Organisational Citizenship\nBehaviour [28], and the Job Content Questionnaire\n(JCQ) (measuring psychological job characteristics\nincluding job decision latitude and job demands [26]),\n(Table 3). Because high job strain, low organizational\njustice, and low team climate have all predicted a large\nvariety of employee wellbeing and health outcomes,\nincluding psychological distress, low involvement, or low\ncitizenship behaviour, these constructs were measured\nalso as potential mediators of the clinical behaviours.\nStress was measured using a 12-item measure based on\nthe General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) [29]. In\nTable 2 The six clinical behaviours\n1. Giving advice about weight management to patients with type 2 diabetes whose BMI is above a target of 30kg\/m2, even following\nprevious management.\n2. Prescribing additional antihypertensive drugs for patients with type 2 diabetes whose blood pressure (BP) is above a target of 140\nmm Hg for Systolic BP or 80 mm Hg for Diastolic BP, even following previous management.\n3. Examining foot circulation and sensation in the feet of patients with type 2 diabetes, registered with your practice.\n4. Providing advice about self-management to patients with type 2 diabetes, registered with your practice.\n5. Prescribing additional therapy for the management of glycaemic control (HbA1c) for the management of HbA1c in patients whose\nHbA1c is higher than 8.0%, despite maximum dosage of two oral hypoglycaemic drugs.\n6. Providing general education about diabetes for patients with type 2 diabetes, registered with your practice.\nEccles et al. Implementation Science 2011, 6:61\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/6\/1\/61\nPage 4 of 21\naddition, \u2018diabetes specific\u2019 versions of two scales (shor-\ntened version of the Team Climate Inventory and the\nJCQ) were developed in order to explore if they were\nbetter predictors of these behaviours than their generic\ncounterparts. These diabetes-specific versions were for\ncompletion only by respondents who provided care for\npatients with type 2 diabetes as part of their routine role\nwithin the practice. The questionnaire also included\nquestions about demographic descriptors, the respon-\ndent\u2019s self-perceived role, who they identified as being\ninvolved in delivering care for patients with diabetes in\nthe practice, and two questions covering sickness\nabsence and plans to leave their current job.\nThe second section of the baseline questionnaire (Addi-\ntional File 2, pages 9 to 43) comprised items based on\ntheoretical constructs from individual psychological\nmodels, including social cognitions models (Theory of\nPlanned Behaviour [30], Social Cognitive Theory [31,32],\nLearning Theory [33,34], Self Reported Habit Index [35],\nAction Planning\/Coping Planning [36,37]) (Table 4) ask-\ning about performing the six different clinical beha-\nviours. The measured constructs from models of\nmotivational factors (individual perceptions about, and\nattitudes towards, personally performing the six clinical\nbehaviours and their intentions to perform the beha-\nviours) and action factors (including habits, rewards,\naction plans, coping plans) over the following 12\nmonths. The wording of the items to operationalise the\ntheoretical models was informed by the pilot work\nundertaken for previous studies by the authors using\nsimilar methodology and theoretical models\n[4,5,12,38-40]. We measured intentions in two ways. As\nwell as a traditional strength of intention measure (I\nintend\/plan\/expect to < perform behaviour >; score 1 to\n7), a direct estimate of intention measure was included\n(Over the next 12 months, given 10 patients < definition\nof patients >, for how many do you intend to < perform\nbehaviour >; score 0 to 10), in order to allow us to\nexplore if one or other method of measurement affected\nthe prediction of behaviour.\nThe third section of the baseline questionnaire\nincluded four patient scenarios designed to simulate the\nbehaviour that an individual clinician would perform\nduring a consultation and delivered in a format to simu-\nlate the computer screen available during consultations\n(see pages 33 to 43 Additional File 2). Primary care doc-\ntors and nurses were asked whether they would address\neach of a series of diabetes-related factors, including the\nsix behaviours targeted in the present study, by indicat-\ning whether they \u2018would do\u2019 or \u2018would do if time\u2019\naddress each diabetes-related area of care. The attributes\nof each scenario were varied, but given the small num-\nber of scenarios it was not possible to systematically\nvary every combination of every variable.\nQuestionnaire piloting\nTwo primary care practices in northeast England took\npart in piloting the questionnaires. The first section\n(organisational questions) was piloted with seven admin-\nistrative staff (practice managers, secretarial and recep-\ntion staff) and seven healthcare professionals (primary\ncare physicians, practice nurses, and one healthcare\nassistant). Piloting was by postal survey for all adminis-\ntrative staff and for five clinical staff. Participants were\nprovided with the questionnaire and a stamped\naddressed envelope to return the questionnaire to the\nstudy research associate. They were given written gui-\ndance that asked them to complete the questions in\ntheir own time, noting how long it took to complete\nand to comment freely on the clarity and acceptability\nof the questions. The questions were found to be accep-\ntable, there were no missing responses and the time\nTable 3 Description of the measures included in the organisational questions of the baseline questionnaire\nMeasure Description (number of questions; scoring)\nOrganisational Justice Measures perceived organisational justice and fairness (14; 1 to 7).\nTwo dimensions: Procedural Justice (7); Relational Justice (7).\nTeam Climate Inventory* Measures perceptions of openness to innovation in teams (14; 1 to 7).

No adjustments were\nmade to the questions following piloting.\nThe second and third sections were initially piloted\nusing postal methods as described above with one pri-\nmary care physician and two practice nurses. One lead\nprimary care physician for diabetes and one diabetes\nspecialist nurse also piloted the questionnaire during a\nface-to-face session with the study research associate\nusing \u2018think aloud\u2019 technique [41]. Based on the feed-\nback received and concerns expressed during the \u2018think\naloud\u2019 sessions, adjustments were made to minimise\nrepetition in the wording of the items, and two beha-\nvioural scenarios (see Measures of behaviour below)\nwere removed (leaving four in the final version) to\nshorten the questionnaire and to keep the completion\ntime within an estimated maximum of two hours. The\namended questionnaire was then re-piloted using postal\nmethods with the two original \u2018think aloud\u2019 participants\nand an additional two primary care physicians and two\npractice nurses. No further amendments were suggested\nas a result of the re-piloting. All pilot participants\nreceived book vouchers (\u00a310 for administrative staff, \u00a320\nfor nursing staff, and \u00a350 for doctors) for returning a\ncompleted questionnaire.\nTwelve-month self-reported behaviour questionnaire\nA \u2018self-reported behaviour\u2019 questionnaire, asked indivi-\ndual clinicians about their performance of each of the\nsix clinical behaviours over the previous 12 months (see\nAdditional File 3: Self Reported behaviour question-\nnaire). The items used in this very brief questionnaire\n(one item for each of the six clinical behaviours) were\nworded: Over the past 12 months, given 10 patients\nwith diabetes < attributes of patients >, for how many\ndid you < perform behavior >? (scored 0 to 10). Such\nmeasures of behaviour are commonly used and are well\npredicted by social cognition models [2].\nTable 4 Theories, models, and other measures of individual cognitions and attributes and example questions\nModel, theoretical constructs\n(number of questions)\nExample Item(s)\nTheory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)\nAttitude (3) In my management of patients with diabetes I think it is beneficial to them to \u2019provide advice about\nweight management.\u2019 (scored 1 to 7)\nSubjective Norm (2) In my management of patients with diabetes I am expected to \u2019provide advice about weight\nmanagement.\u2019 (scored 1 to 7)\nPerceived Behavioural Control (2) In my management of patients with diabetes I am confident that I can \u2019provide advice about weight\nmanagement.\u2019 (scored 1 to 7)\nIntention (3) In my management of patients with diabetes I intend to \u2019provide advice about weight management.\u2019\n(scored 1 to 7)\nDirect estimate of Intention (1) Over the next 12 months, given 10 patients \u2018whose BMI is above target,\u2019 for how many do you intend to\n\u2018provide advice about weight management.\u2019 (Scored 0 to 10)\nSocial Cognitive Theory (SCT)\nOutcome expectancies (3) In my management of patients with diabetes I think it is good practice to \u2019provide advice about weight\nmanagement.\u2019 (scored 1 to 7)\nSelf Efficacy:\nClinical behaviour: 1 (10); 2 (9); 3 (8);(9);\n5 (8); 6 (11)\nI am confident that I can \u2018provide advice about weight management\u2019 to any patient whose BMI is above\ntarget even when \u2018the patient\u2019s BMI has been stable for five years.\u2019 (scored 1 to 7)\nLearning Theory (OLT)\nAnticipated consequences (3) In my management of patients with diabetes \u2018whose BMI is above target.\u2019.. overall, it is highly likely\nthat they will be worse off if I \u2019provide advice about weight management.\u2019 (scored 1 to 7)\nEvidence of habitual behaviour (2) In my management of patients with diabetes \u2018whose BMI is above target.\u2019.. it is my usual practice to\n\u2019provide advice about weight management.\u2019 (scored 1 to 7)\nSelf-reported Habit Index (SRHI) (12) Providing advice about weight management to patients whose BMI is above target is something that \u2018I\ndo frequently.\u2019 (scored 1 to 7)\nAction planning\/coping planning\nAction planning (3) I have a clear plan of \u2018how I will\u2019 \u2018provide advice about weight management.\u2019 (scored 1 to 7)\nCoping planning:\nClinical behaviour: 1 (10); 2 (9); 3 (4); 4\n(9); 5 (8); 6 (11)\nI have made a clear plan regarding \u2018providing advice about weight management to patients whose BMI is\nabove target if ...\u2019 \u2018the patient\u2019s BMI has been stable for five years\u2019 (scored 1 to 7)\nPast behaviour (1) Over the past 12 months, for approximately how many of the last 10 patients with diabetes \u2018whose BMI\nwas above target\u2019 did you \u2018provide advice about weight management\u2019 (scored 0 to 10).\nDemographics Gender, years qualified, trainer status, sessions worked per week; role within primary care practice; job title\nEccles et al.

The study\ncontact was sent a summary of the data collected for\nverification and asked to check with practice colleagues\nas necessary if they were uncertain about the accuracy\nof the data provided.\nBaseline postal questionnaire survey\nThe baseline postal questionnaire survey ran between\nSeptember and December 2008. All the questionnaires\nfor a practice were delivered to the nominated study\ncontact in the practice who then distributed the ques-\ntionnaires to practice colleagues. All participants were\nprovided with written information about the study,\nasked to complete their questionnaires individually, and\nprovided with a pre-paid envelope to return their ques-\ntionnaire directly to the study research associate. Remin-\nders were sent to non-responders at two and four\nweeks. Individuals not wishing to complete the study\nquestionnaire and who wanted this to be confidential\nfrom their practice colleagues were given the option of\nreturning a blank questionnaire.\nTwelve-month self-reported behaviour questionnaire\nsurvey\nThis was administered 12 months after the baseline\nquestionnaire and using the same method as described\nabove.\nMeasures of behaviour\nFive different, complementary measures of the perfor-\nmance of the six study behaviours were collected. The\nfirst two provide individual level measures of behaviour,\nwhile the latter three give aggregated practice level\nbehavioural data.\nSimulated behaviour\nThis \u2018simulated behaviour\u2019 measure derived from clinical\nscenarios (described above) provided the first of two\nmeasures of individual clinicians\u2019 self-reported perfor-\nmance of the six study behaviours. Clinicians could\nendorse that they \u2018would do\u2019 (score 2) or \u2018would do if\ntime\u2019 (score 1) each behaviour plus add explanatory text.\nScores for one of the simulated behaviours were\nadjusted to reflect current best practice-prescribing\nadditional drug therapy for the management of HbA1c\nwas, at the time of the study, advised for individuals\nwhose HbA1c was above 8.0%. Therefore, for scenarios\nin which the simulated patient\u2019s HbA1c was \u22648.0%, the\ncorrect decision was not to prescribe additional therapy,\nand respondents who did not indicate that they would\nact on this were credited with having made the evi-\ndence-based decision.\nClinician self-reported behaviour\nThe 12-month self-reported behaviour questionnaire\n(described above) provided the second measure of indi-\nvidual clinicians\u2019 self-reported performance of the six\nstudy behaviours.\nClinician behaviour based on data extracted from practice\ncomputer systems\nAnonymised individual patient biochemical, physiologi-\ncal, and drug data were extracted from practice compu-\nter systems for all patients with a diagnosis of type 2\ndiabetes registered with the practice (see Additional File\n4: List of Read Codes for the data items). For each of\nthe computer systems used by the practices, search\nqueries were written by an experienced National Health\nService (NHS) performance data manager. Data were\nextracted for a 25-month period (i.e., 12 months prior\nto and 12 months after the month within which the\nbaseline survey was launched). The search queries were\nsent to each practice along with written guidance on\nrunning the query, a process that practices were familiar\nwith. The performance data manager also provided\npractices with telephone and email support if needed.\nPatient-report of clinicians\u2019 behaviour\nWe anticipated that information on some of the study\nbehaviours of interest might be recorded poorly, if at all,\nin the computer records, specifically those on the provi-\nsion of advice on weight management, self-management,\nand general education. A single relevant question about\neach was included in a patient satisfaction questionnaire\npreviously used by the Healthcare Commission [42]. In\norder to increase the specificity of the measure, as well\nas the single item, we identified additional items that\nassessed specific aspects of each behaviour with the aim\nof producing a composite score for each behaviour. We\nexamined the internal consistencies and ran principle\ncomponents analyses on the items within each beha-\nviour and then across behaviours. Performance of foot\nexamination was also asked about and so provided an\nadditional, single item, measure of this behaviour.\nUsing a single posting, anonymous (to the research\nteam) survey (for the questionnaire see Additional File\n5), we asked patients in the study practices about their\nexperiences of their clinicians providing advice about\nweight management, self-management, and general edu-\ncation about their diabetes.

Questionnaires were distributed\nfrom the practice and returned to the study research\nassociate.\nQuality and outcomes framework data\nThe Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is a\nvoluntary annual reward and incentive programme for\nall primary care practices in UK, detailing practice per-\nformance across a number of clinical areas (of which\ndiabetes mellitus is one) plus organisational areas\n[43,44]. The data are extracted from practice computer\nsystems by the local primary healthcare administrative\nauthority on an annual basis using a standard data\nextraction query. The data are publically available and\nQOF data on the diabetes and organisational domains\nwere obtained from the NHS Information Centre http:\/\/\nwww.ic.nhs.uk\/. The QOF data for diabetes mellitus and\npractice organisation were collected for each of the par-\nticipating practices for the 12-month period of QOF\ndata collection (May 2008 to April 2009) that best\nmatched the 12-month period after baseline question-\nnaire completion. Where available, practice level\nnumerators and denominators were obtained for dia-\nbetes mellitus indicators and percentage achievement\nlevels were calculated; where they were not available,\nthe calculated point score is reported.\nEthics approval\nThe study was approved by Newcastle and North Tyne-\nside 2 Research Ethics Committee, REC reference num-\nber 07\/H0907\/102.\nResults\nRecruitment and instrument response rates\nThe process of recruitment of primary care practices is\nshown in Figure 1. The initial invitation went to all\nGPRF practices in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland,\nand a random sample of practices in England up to a\ntotal of 500 practices. One hundred practices were\nrecruited and all took part in the telephone interview,\nbaseline, and follow-up phases of the study. One prac-\ntice was subsequently excluded from all analyses due to\nlow completion rates for all data collection; we subse-\nquently report on 99 practices. All practices completed\na telephone interview. Informants were GPs for 47 prac-\ntices, nurses for 37 practices and the practice manager\nfor 15 practices. All practices were invited to verify their\ndata summaries and 75 did so.\nThe baseline questionnaire (organisational questions)\nwas sent to all clinical and administrative staff (2,079 in\ntotal). Usable completed questionnaires were returned\nby 946\/1,236 (76.5%) administrative staff, 423\/529\n(80.0%) primary care doctors, and 255\/314 (81.2%)\nnurses (see Figure 2). One thousand and fifty-five staff\nmembers indicated that providing care for patients with\ndiabetes was part of their routine role and 890\/1,055\n(84.4%) went on to complete the diabetes-specific ver-\nsions of the measures in the questionnaire.\nThe baseline questionnaire (clinical questions) was\nsent to all clinical staff within each of the 99 practices\n(843 in total). Of clinicians who indicated that they were\ninvolved in providing diabetes care, usable completed\nquestionnaires were returned by 326\/361 (90.3%) pri-\nmary care doctors and 163\/186 (87.6%) nurses (see Fig-\nure 2). Three hundred and ten primary care doctors and\n162 primary care nurses responded to at least one area\nof care in every clinical scenario. Table 5 presents the\npractice level response rates for the two baseline ques-\ntionnaires by staff type (excluding 146 questionnaires\nthat were returned blank). We achieved 100% overall\nresponse rates from clinicians in 40 practices and\nachieved responses from over 80% of clinicians in 67\npractices. We achieved 100% response from 38% of\npractices for at least one of the generic organisational\nquestionnaires and from 84% of practice for at least one\nof the two diabetes-specific organisational question-\nnaires. Sixty percent of practices had a 100% response\nfor questions on at least one individual-level psychologi-\ncal model.\nThe follow-up questionnaire was sent to 843 clinical\nstaff. Six hundred and ninety-four (82.3%) completed\nquestionnaires were returned. Of those involved in pro-\nviding diabetes care, 427\/547 (78.1%) could be paired\nwith a completed baseline clinical questionnaire (see\nFigure 2).\nPractices were supplied with a total of 8,600 patient\nquestionnaires. Given the anonymous nature of the sur-\nvey and the fact that practices with less than 100\npatients with diabetes will have sent out fewer question-\nnaires a precise response rate cannot be calculated. A\ntotal of 3,591 analysable questionnaires were received\n(41.8% return rate).\nStudy practices\nSeventy-four of the recruited practices were located in\nEngland, 13 in Scotland, four in Wales, and eight in\nNorthern Ireland. Thirty-seven were rural practices and\n62 were urban; 15 had branch surgeries (range 2 to 5\nsites); 18 were dispensing practices; 62 were training\npractices. The mean (SD) patient list size was 7,431\n(4,040), with a mean (SD) proportion of patients aged\nover 65 years of 18% (7%). Most practices served\npatients of mainly \u2018White British\u2019 origin (84\/99), and 63\npractices \u2018never\u2019 or \u2018rarely\u2019 used interpreters. Tables 6\nand 7 summarise the structural and functional charac-\nteristics of the study practices, both in general and in\nrelation to diabetes care. There was a mean (SD) of 5.4\n(2.7) doctors per practice covering a mean (SD) of 36.4\nEccles et al.

Though only compared descriptively,\nstudy practices were of an equivalent size to MRC\nGPRF practices overall (mean list size 7,696). Since\ndevolution in 1998, comparative UK data is hard to find\nbut, compared to all general practices in England, the\nstudy practices were larger and had more doctors (2007\nEngland mean list size: 6,487; mean number of practi-\ntioners per partnership: 4) and, at 4%, the study sample\nalso contained a low proportion of single-handed prac-\ntices [45].\nQuestionnaire results descriptive data\nBaseline organisational questionnaire\nTable 8 presents alphas for internal consistency of the\nmeasures included in the organisational questionnaire\nand the mean (SD) scores for each measure and for\nboth general and diabetes specific organisational mea-\nsures.

Within the\nself-report questions, for both groups of clinicians,\nalthough reported rates of performing the behaviours\nwere high, with two-thirds of rates being above seven\nout of ten, there was variation within the rates with\nstandard deviations generally being just over two.\nNurses reported performing the three \u2018giving advice\u2019\nbehaviours more often than doctors did, reporting per-\nforming the behaviour for almost 9 out of 10 patients.\nFor foot examination, there was the widest difference\nbetween doctors and nurses, potentially reflecting dif-\nferent agreed roles and different patient populations\nseen.\nThe single-item patient report data are directly com-\nparable to the clinician report data and, for foot exam-\nination, the patients\u2019 reports matched the nurses self-\nreport almost exactly. For the other three advising\nbehaviours, the patient-reported rates of receiving\nadvice are consistently lower than the clinician-\nreported rates of giving it. For advice about self-man-\nagement and providing advice about general education\n(converting the clinician n\/10 scores into percentages)\nthe gap is 21% and 14%, respectively. For advice about\nweight management, the gap is 52% with clinicians\nreporting that they gave advice about twice as often as\npatients reported receiving it.\nWhen testing the composite items, the principal\ncomponents analysis (PCA) on items within each beha-\nviour suggested that each involved more than one\ncomponent. For providing weight management advice\nand providing general education, these did not out-\nweigh the clinical face validity of the initial scales nor\ndid removing items improve the internal consistency.\nFor providing self-management advice, PCA results\ninformed the decision to remove three items. For the\nresulting composite measures, there were eight items\nfor providing weight management advice (Cronbach\u2019s\nalpha 0.80), three items for providing self-management\nadvice (Cronbach\u2019s alpha 0.66), and 18 items for pro-\nviding general education (Cronbach\u2019s alpha 0.91).\nDetails of the items and the analysis are in Additional\nFile 6.\nThe mean (SD) scores for the composite items are\nshown in Table 10. For providing weight management\nadvice, 51% of patients endorsed the single item but the\nmean number of items endorsed was 2.5\/8, although\n71% responded \u2018yes\u2019 to at least one item. Similarly, for\nproviding self-management advice, 67.5% of patients\nendorsed the single item, the mean score on the compo-\nsite measure was 1.5\/3 and 83.4% responded \u2018yes\u2019 to at\nleast one item; for providing general education, 72.3%\nendorsed the single item, the mean score on the compo-\nsite measure was 7.4\/18 and 93% responded \u2018yes\u2019 to at\nleast one item.\nClinician behaviour based on data extracted from practice\ncomputer systems\nRunning the query\nOf the 99 included practices, one refused to run the\ndata extraction query because of previous problems\nwhen running computer data extraction queries. For\nseven practices operating one computer system the\nquery did not work, and four practices did not run the\nquery despite repeated reminders. Thus 87 of the 99\npractices ran the electronic query. For four of the prac-\ntices, there was no usable drug data; the issuing of pre-\nscriptions was recorded but not the drug name or dose.\nA fifth practice had many missing data items for the\nsecond year-no patients in that practice were found as\nbeing eligible for the addition of an extra therapy to\ncontrol their HbA1c and there were no recorded feet\ninspections in year two (although there were many\nrecorded in year one). A sixth practice had no eligible\npatients for the glycaemic control behaviour. Therefore\nthe analyses of behaviour two (prescribing additional\nantihypertensive drugs) and behaviour five (prescribing\nadditional therapy for managing glycaemic control) are\nbased on 83 and 81 practices, respectively, with 86 prac-\ntices being analysed for behaviour three (examining\nfeet).\nComputer data and the study behaviours\nThe rates of the study behaviours are in Table 10. The\ndata extracted from the practice computers are usually\nof the form of process (recording that a behaviour was\ndone such as issuing a prescription) or intermediate\npatient outcome measures (such as recorded BP). The\nlinks between this data and the study behaviours are\nmore or less direct. For behaviour one (providing advice\non weight management), data for weight\/height\/body\nmass index (BMI) was available from all practices and\nreflects the physiological endpoint of the behaviour we\nasked about. However, assuming such advice is given,\nthere are a number of clinician (how well was it given)\nand patient (was it heard, accepted, acted upon) factors\nthat intervene before any effect of performing the beha-\nviour plays out through a change in a measure such as\nBMI. Unfortunately, the available computer codes for\noffering advice about weight though present were infre-\nquently used and hence cannot be used as an outcome\nmeasure in this project. Behaviour two (prescribing\nadditional antihypertensive drugs) and behaviour five\n(prescribing additional therapy for managing glycaemic\ncontrol) relate to drug prescription in relation to physi-\ncal examination or laboratory test results. Values for BP\nand HbA1c were universally available, and drug data\nthat was available from 81 practices. The analysis is cur-\nrently computing the eligible patient populations (BP >\n145\/85; HbA1c > 8.0) and whether or not relevant\nEccles et al. Implementation Science 2011, 6:61\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/6\/1\/61\nPage 16 of 21\ntreatment was increased or added at relevant consulta-\ntions. This is entailing a considerable amount of coding\nof frequency of dose data (usually entered as text rather\nthan coded data) and coding of maximum doses of\ndrugs to allow the identification of a population of\npatients who most closely match the behaviour.\nAlthough time consuming, this will provide a much\nmore precise measure of a prescribing behaviour than\nwe have been able to achieve in previous studies where\nwe relied on routine data [5]. Data on the rates of per-\nforming behaviour three (examining feet) was available\nfrom 86 practices. For behaviours four and six, we\nfound low rates of relevant computer codes both within\nand across practices. For behaviour four (providing\nadvice on self management), we have computer code\ndata for 68 practices (and from only 63 of these in the\nyear following completion of the questionnaires); in\naddition, we have coded data on the provision of dia-\nbetes self-monitoring equipment (the use of which can\nform part of self-management) recorded from 47 prac-\ntices. Patient education codes (behaviour six) were\nrecorded in only 33 practices (and in 19 in the year fol-\nlowing completion of the baseline questionnaires).\nTherefore, for these two behaviours we will be using the\npatients report data as our main measure of the\nbehaviour.\nQuality and Outcomes Framework data\nThe QOF data are shown in Table 11.

For\n\u2018giving advice about weight management\u2019 the only indi-\ncator related to weight is \u2018patients\u2019 notes recording BMI\u2019\nand, although this might reflect on the organisation of a\npractice, with mean achievement levels of 96% and a\nstandard deviation of three, like the other organisational\nindicators, it too is unlikely to have sufficient variation\nto be discriminating. There is a good match for \u2018foot\nexamination\u2019 and the mean achievement levels of 92%\nmatch the clinician and patient report well. For the\nother two behaviours \u2018prescribing additional anti-hyper-\ntensive drugs\u2019 and \u2018prescribing additional therapy for the\nmanagement of glycaemic control,\u2019 there are indicators\nthat could reflect the active performance of the two\nbehaviours. In practices where clinicians are actively try-\ning to tightly control both BP and glycaemic control, it\nwould be reasonable to expect higher rates of patients\nwith lower BP and HbA1c-and there is one QOF indica-\ntor for each of these with rates of performance of 80%\nand 68% respectively.\nDiscussion\nWe have assembled an unparalleled data set from clini-\ncians reporting on their cognitions in relation to the\nperformance of six clinical behaviours involved in the\nmanagement of people with one chronic disease (dia-\nbetes mellitus), using a range of organisational and indi-\nvidual level measures as well as information on the\nstructure of the practice teams and across a large num-\nber of UK primary care practices.\nIn the context of generally falling response rates to\npostal questionnaire surveys of clinicians [49], we have\npreviously had to deal with low response rates for the-\nory-based questionnaires surveys [4-6,50]. As a conse-\nquence, we have had to contend with the fact that the\ndata from such studies may not be representative. In\nthis study, individual response rates varied by the clini-\ncal behaviour and whether it was the responsibility of\nthe respondent to perform that behaviour (e.g., nurses\nwho didn\u2019t prescribe didn\u2019t answer the two prescribing\nbehaviours questions); nonetheless, we achieved indivi-\ndual response rates that varied within practices from\n71 to 96%, figures far higher than usually achieved\n[49]. We assume that this is in part due to working\nwith motivated practices (though this may compromise\nrepresentativeness in a different way) and using a\npowerful behaviour change technique of offering\nreward (payment) based on satisfactory completion\nrates by practices rather than simply compensation for\neach individual \u2019s time involved in completing the\nquestionnaires.\nMore importantly, because diabetes is a condition\ncared for by the integrated behaviours of multiple team\nmembers, we were particularly interested in achieving\nhigh levels of responses from all clinicians (physicians\nand nurses) within a practice. We achieved 100%\nresponse rates from clinicians in 40 practices, and\nachieved responses from over 80% of clinicians in 58\npractices; for the questions about the six clinical beha-\nviours, these figures rose to 60 and 76, respectively.\nHowever, despite working with research active practices,\nstressing the requirement for high response rates and\nrecompensing them for their completion, for between 1\nand 13 practices (depending on the section of the ques-\ntionnaire) we received responses from less than 50% of\neligible respondents.\nWhilst the organisational measures were standard\nquestionnaires (and achieved expected levels of internal\nconsistency), our operationalisation of the individual\ncognition measures was good with measures of internal\nconsistency all well within accepted ranges and good\ncontent coverage of the constructs. Many of the indivi-\ndual cognition scores are high, suggesting that respon-\ndents are already positively inclined towards performing\nthe behaviours. These two groups of measures will\ntogether form a large part of our explanatory variables\nin explaining variation in rates of performing the beha-\nviours. A standard analysis would calculate the variance\nin behaviour explained by each measure but, under cir-\ncumstances such as these (where values are very posi-\ntive), it is possible that contextual and environmental\nfactors are important in whether or not the behaviours\nare successfully performed. Given the range of such fac-\ntors that we have measured, we will be able to perform\na more comprehensive analysis to generate hypotheses\nabout where it might be best to intervene to improve\nperformance.\nWe have successfully collected a number of different\nproxy measures of behaviour. These are a mix of indivi-\ndual level measures (self report, scenario simulation\nscores) and practice level measures (patient report, clini-\ncal data from practice computers, and QOF data). They\nalso represent a range of measures of performing the\nbehaviour (self-report) through to measures of the phy-\nsiological consequences of the behaviour having been\nperformed (measures from the practice computer such\nas BMI, BP, and HbA1c).\nWe extracted a considerable dataset relevant to the\nbehaviours from the computers of the participating\npractices. Having defined six specific behaviours impor-\ntant to the management of patients with type 2 diabetes,\nit is salutary to reflect that only one (foot examination)\nwas readily available within the computer records. For\ntwo of the behaviours (prescribing for BP control and\nglycaemic control), we will be able to compute an\nEccles et al. Implementation Science 2011, 6:61\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/6\/1\/61\nPage 18 of 21\naccurate measure (after considerable data processing),\nand for one other the computer record contained a phy-\nsiological measure reflecting the performance of the\nbehaviour across several links and interactions with\nother factors in a causal chain (BMI for advising about\nweight management). For the other two (advising beha-\nviours), the computer record contained inconsistently\nrecorded, and ultimately unusable, data.\nThese was no single, ideal, measure of behaviour, and\nany study such as this will have to balance the strengths\nand weaknesses of different measures of behaviour. It is\nnot difficult to produce a list of potential biases-clinician\nself-report will be susceptible to a desirability reporting\nbias, simulated behaviour scores from the scenarios will\nbe complicated to interpret and score, patient report\nwill be susceptible to (at least) non-response, and recall\nbiases and computer records will be susceptible to\nrecording bias. However, for a study conducted on this\nscale, there is no ready alternative to the behaviour mea-\nsures that we have collected, and whilst we will need to\nbe sensitive to the potential shortcomings of the data in\nour analyses, we do not believe it is possible to produce\nbetter measures. While each of these measures on its\nown could present constraints as a true measure of the\ntarget behaviours, having all five measures will allow\ncross-validation.\nMaking simultaneous measurement across six beha-\nviours allows a degree of comparison not previously\nreported in the implementation literature. It is clear\nfrom the data presented here that cognitions (all mea-\nsured at the same point in time) vary across behaviours.\nUsing direct estimation of intention as an example, this\nvaries from 7.4 (out of a possible 10) for examining feet\nto 9.0 for providing weight management advice for 10\npatients. The availability of such variation within and\nacross behaviours should strengthen our ability to\nexplain behaviour.\nGiven that the data held in practice computers repre-\nsents the actions of different members of the practice\nteam, the measures of self-report behaviour and simu-\nlated behaviour represent our only individual level mea-\nsures of behaviour. In order to analyse the practice level\ndata (from patient report, the practice computer sys-\ntems, and QOF), we are going to have to deal with how\nbest to aggregate our individual-level explanatory mea-\nsures up to that of the team or organisation. Many pre-\nvious measures have used the arithmetic mean, but it is\nby no means clear that this is the best metric for aggre-\ngation [51]. Approaches such as weighting systems using\nthe scores of those whose role it is to perform the rele-\nvant behaviour may represent a better way forward.\nThe dataset that we have assembled represents one of\nthe most comprehensive of its type, and the research\nteam is very keen to maximise the use of it. To this end,\nwe would welcome approaches to collaborate on the\nanalysis of this data from other researchers and, once\nwe have completed our main analyses, would be willing\nto explore making suitably anonymised data available to\nexternal groups for collaborative analyses.\nConclusions\nThis paper is the first of a series of papers. It reports in\ndetail the instrument development and data collected.\nAnalyses of this large data set will, we hope, lead to the\ndevelopment of a series of strategies aimed at promoting\nthe improvement of care for patients with diabetes as\nwell as a series of rich insights into organisational and\nindividual factors influencing clinician behaviour.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Telephone interview schedule.pdf.
