Extensive research in this field has con-\ncentrated on the highly developed parts of the world, in par-\nticular North America and Europe with a strong research in-\nfrastructure. In a recent review, Williams et al. (2007) identi-\nfied Africa as \u201cone of the weakest links in our understanding\nof the global carbon cycle.\u201d Africa is the second largest con-\ntinent of the world occupying about 20% of global land mass\nand inhabits a large variety of ecosystems ranging from per-\nhumid tropical forest to semi-arid and arid grass and shrub\ncommunities. Although Africa\u2019s decadal scale mean carbon\nbalance appears to be neutral, the continent contributes about\nhalf of the interannual variability of the carbon balance on\nglobal scale (Williams et al., 2007). This large interannual\nvariability results primarily from climatic perturbations re-\nlated to the El Nino phenomenon that directly affects the\necosystems\u2019 productivity and due to concomitant biomass\nburning (e.g. Le Page et al., 2007; Anyamba et al., 2002,\n2003; Myneni et al., 1996; Kogan 2000).\nGiven the scarcity of observation sites for atmospheric\nCO2 concentrations and land \u2013 atmosphere CO2 exchange\nthe uncertainties of African carbon cycle research remain\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n286 U. Weber et al.: Interannual variability of Africas ecosystem productivity\nhigh in particular regarding the spatial localization of hotspot\nregions of variability and the underlying driving forces. Sim-\nulations of terrestrial ecosystem models can provide insights\nhere; however, these models are also associated with large\nuncertainties (e.g. McGuire et al., 2001; Friedlingstein et al.,\n2006) in particular for water limited conditions (e.g. Morales\net al., 2005; Jung et al., 2007), and in addition have gener-\nally not been tested and parameterized specifically for Africa.\nThus, confidence of a single model analysis is limited and a\nmulti-model study is warranted to identify coherent and dis-\nsimilar behavior between different biosphere models.\nIn this study we assess the interannual variability of\nAfrica\u2019s carbon cycle using four different terrestrial carbon\ncycle models in conjunction with remotely sensed indicators\nfor the state of the vegetation as well as carbon balance esti-\nmates from global atmospheric inversions. We aim to iden-\ntify (1) regions of largest carbon balance interannual variabil-\nity, (2) the primary process (photosynthesis or respiration)\ndominating the carbon balance variability, and (3) which cli-\nmate variables are driving the ecosystem\u2019s carbon cycle in\nthe models.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 Model descriptions\nThe four ecosystem models ORCHIDEE (Krinner et al.,\n2005), LPJ-DGVM (Sitch et al., 2003), LPJ-GUESS (Smith\net al., 2001), and JULES\/TRIFFID (Cox et al., 2001; Es-\nsery et al., 2001; Hughes et al., 2006) applied in this\nstudy are coupled biogeography-biogeochemistry models,\ni.e. they combine representations of both vegetation dynam-\nics and land-atmosphere carbon and water exchanges (dy-\nnamic global vegetation models \u2013 DGVMs). The concept of\nplant functional types (PFT) (Smith et al., 1997) is used to\ndiscretize differences in physiology and allometry of species\nincluding adaptations to climatic conditions and disturbance\nregime. PFTs compete for resources like light, and water.\nRepresentations of vegetation structure like allometry, and\nfunction like phenology, allocation, mortality, and establish-\nment are essential for this. Gross primary production (GPP)\nis calculated based on a coupled photosynthesis-water bal-\nance scheme after (Farquhar et al., 1980; Collatz et al., 1991,\n1992), where simplifications have been incorporated in the\ndifferent models as described in detail in the above refer-\nences. Heterotrophic respiration is assumed to be represented\nby first-order decay of organic material with decay rates for\na few pools (Foley, 1995) which depend on temperature and\nmoisture following (Lloyd and Talor, 1994) or a Q10 formula.\nFire, the main disturbance in the region is simulated follow-\ning (Thonicke et al., 2001) within LPJ-DGVM, ORCHIDEE,\nand LPJ-GUESS.\nThe applied models differ in the temporal resolution and in\nthe resolution of vegetation structure representations. While\nLPJ-DGVM and LPJ-GUESS are designed as stand-alone\nmodels running on a daily time step, ORCHIDEE and\nJULES can be coupled to General Circulation Models func-\ntioning as land-surface schemes. Therefore, latter models re-\nsolve the diurnal cycle with time steps of 30 to 60 min. Usu-\nally, the LPJ family of models is driven by monthly climatic\ndata which are interpolated to pseudo-daily using a whether\ngenerator for precipitation. In this study, the LPJ-DGVM is\ndriven by daily climatic inputs. In doing so, net radiation\nis approximated from global radiation after Linacre (1969).\nThe LPJ-GUESS has the most advanced representation of\nvegetation structure including age with features of a forest-\ngap model (Shugart, 1984) resolving forest succession. LPJ-\nDGVM and ORCHIDEE have intermediate complexity ap-\nplying the concept of \u201caverage individuals\u201d for a whole grid\ncell (Sitch et al., 2003) while JULES\/TRIFFID employs a\nheuristic approach to determine the vegetation coverage and\ncarbon allocation to each PFT.\n2.2 Model drivers\nAll models are driven by the same climate data, atmospheric\nCO2 concentration, and soil texture type on a 1\u25e6 grid from\n1982 to 2006, which has been derived as follows: Meteo-\nrological forcing (near surface air temperature, specific hu-\nmidity, wind speed, radiation, and precipitation) originates\nfrom 6-hourly NCEP-DOE Reanalysis-2 (Kanamitsu et al.,\n2002) that were spatially interpolated to 1\u25e6 from the origi-\nnal T62 Gaussian grid. Despite substantial improvements of\nNCEP R2 over R1 considerable precipitation biases remain\nin comparison to various independent data sets (Fekete et al.,\n2004). To account for these limitations, precipitation was\ncorrected using more reliable data sets based on observations\nfrom the satellite based Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission\n(TRMM 3B43) available from 1998\u20132006 (Kummerow et\nal., 1998) and from interpolated station data provided by the\nClimate Research Unit (CRU) from 1961\u20132003 (CRUTR2.1,\nMitchell and Jones, 2005). The general calibration method\nfollows Williams et al. (2008), Ngo-Duc et al. (2005) and\nSheffield et al. (2006), where the daily values of the origi-\nnal NCEP data for each grid cell are scaled to match in their\nmonthly totals those of the corresponding CRU and TRMM\ndata. For the CRU period (1979\u20131997) precipitation was cor-\nrected following:\nCAl NCEPy,m,d,h = NCEPy,m,d,h \u00d7 CRUy,mNCEPy,m \u00d7 (1)\u22112006\n1998 TRMMm\u22112006\n1998 CRUm\nFor the TRMM period (1998\u20132006) the calibration used:\nCAl NCEPy,m,d,h = NCEPy,m,d,h \u00d7 TRMMy,mNCEPy,m (2)\nBiogeosciences, 6, 285\u2013295, 2009 www.biogeosciences.net\/6\/285\/2009\/\nU. Weber et al.: Interannual variability of Africas ecosystem productivity 287\nFig. 1. African ecoregions\nThe adjustment yielded an overall reduction of 15.2% pre-\ncipitation.\nSoil texture is given by the IGBP-DIS map at 1\u25e6 (Tempel et\nal., 1996). Data on the annual CO2 concentration was taken\nfrom measurements at Mauna Loa (www.esrl.noaa.gov\/gmd\/\nccgg\/trends\/).\n2.3 Experimental setup\nThe simulation of the terrestrial carbon and water budgets are\ncarried out at a spatial resolution of 1\u25e6\u00d71\u25e6 for entire conti-\nnental Africa for the target period 1982\u20132006. Spin-up cal-\nculations were performed by repeating the years 1982\u20131992\nusing the meteorological data sets of the appropriate years\nand a fixed CO2 concentration of 341.13 ppm (Mauna Loa\nvalue in 1982) until carbon pools reach equilibrium. After\nthe spin-up, model simulations start in 1982 with rising CO2\nconcentration per annum. Potential vegetation distribution\nwas dynamically simulated by the models.\n2.4 Data analysis\nDefinition of regions\nWe define six major regions of sub-saharan Africa based\non the broad distribution of ecosystem types (available from\nglobal land cover maps), and thus implicitly according\nto bioclimatic conditions: Northern Savannah Belt, Cen-\ntral African tropical forest, Horn of Africa, Southern rain-\ngreen woodlands, South African grasslands, and Madagascar\n(Fig. 1). Given that Madagascar is small in comparison to the\nother regions and very heterogeneous we do not discuss this\nregion extensively.\nQuantification of interannual variability\nInterannual variability (IAV) is calculated for each pixel\nand model as the standard deviation of the respective quantity\n(e.g. GPP) for a yearly time step across all years, resulting in\na grid of IAV for each model and variable. For identifying\nspatial patterns of relatively high and low interannual vari-\nability, the IAV grid of each model was z-transformed.\nz (IAVi) =\n(\nIAVi \u2212 IAV\n)\n\u03c3IAV\nWhere z(IAVI) is the standardized IAV of grid cell i, IAV\nand \u03c3IAV are the spatial mean and standard deviation of the\nIAV, respectively. Hence z(IAVI ) measures the degree of\nvariability for each pixel in units of standard deviations, i.e.\nvalues larger than 0 refer to above average interannual vari-\nability and for example a value of two indicates variability\nof 2 standard deviations above the mean variability of the\ncontinent. Consistent spatial patterns between all models\nare defined as model agreement and are implemented as the\nsum of models per grid cell which show variability larger\nthan one standard deviation above the mean variability of\nthe continent.\nPrincipal component analysis\nTo analyze the relationship between meteorological\nconditions and simulated carbon fluxes on annual scale we\nfollow the approach of Jung et al. (2007). First we reduce\nthe array of several meteorological driver variables to their\nprincipal components and then calculate the correlation\nbetween meteorological principal components and relative\nflux variations for each grid cell. The principal component\nanalysis (PCA) of the meteorological data reduces the\ndimensionality of the data set and often extracts major\nweather patterns or gradients. We used four annual data\nfields as input to the PCA: precipitation, air temperature,\nradiation, specific air humidity.\nCorroboration against satellite data\nWe use the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radi-\nation (FAPAR) product of Gobron et al. (2006) based on the\nSeaWiFS satellite sensor as a proxy for vegetation productiv-\nity (available at: www.fapar.jrc.it). It has been designed as an\noptimized indicator for the state and health of the vegetation\nand overcomes several limitations of the classically used nor-\nmalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Gobron et al.,\n2000). Jung et al. (2008) have shown that the annual sum\nof FAPAR growing season values correlates strongly with\nannual gross primary production from eddy covariance mea-\nsurement sites in Europe. At first glance it appears to be more\nconsistent to compare simulated FAPAR by the models with\nthe FAPAR satellite retrievals instead of using the FAPAR as\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/6\/285\/2009\/ Biogeosciences, 6, 285\u2013295, 2009\n288 U. Weber et al.: Interannual variability of Africas ecosystem productivity\na proxy for GPP. However, there are several reasons why it\nmakes more sense to interpret the remotely sensed FAPAR as\nan indicator for productivity: (1) ecosystem models tend to\ncapture interannual variability of GPP primarily via interan-\nnual variations of radiation use efficiency and not via changes\nof leaf area (Jung et al., 2007) while the interannual anomaly\npatterns of the SeaWiFS-FAPAR provide a realistic picture of\nthe GPP anomalies (Jung et al., 2008; Gobron et al., 2005),\nand (2) there are conceptual mismatches between the FAPAR\nfrom the satellite and the FAPAR simulated by models. For\nexample the response of herbaceous understorey, which is\nvery sensitive to e.g. water stress, plays likely an important\nrole in the anomaly patterns of the satellite FAPAR by indi-\ncating the direction of change of the ecosystem (see in Jung\net al., 2008 for more discussion). In addition, changes of\nthe remotely sensed FAPAR may originate from changes of\nleaf colour (e.g. leaf darkening or yellowing), which indi-\ncates changes of chlorophyll content and thus radiation use\nefficiency. In contrast, the leaves in the models do not change\ntheir reflective properties; effects of leaf aging on photosyn-\nthesis are in some cases captured as Vcmax being a function\nof leaf age as in ORCHIDEE.\nWe calculate mean annual FAPAR as a proxy for GPP\nafter filling gaps of the FAPAR time series as described\nin Jung et al. (2008). In addition we compare the mean\nseasonal cycles of simulated GPP and remotely sensed\nFAPAR for the defined regions.\nComparison with atmospheric inversions\nWe compare the simulated variations of the African car-\nbon balance in terms of Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP),\nand Net Biome Production (NBP) with results from global\natmospheric inversions from Ro\u00a8denbeck (2005) (version\ns96 v3.1) covering the period of 1997 to 2006 based on glob-\nally 51 stations of atmospheric CO2 records. This way we\nalso determine the role of fire on the interannual variability\nof the carbon balance. Simulated NEP is calculated as GPP\nminus Terrestrial Ecosystem Respiration (TER). Modeled\nNBP is based on the difference of NEP and model specific\nfire emissions, except JULES which does not include fire.\nThe inversions detect carbon emissions from fire. To facili-\ntate comparability between NEP simulations and inversions,\nwe used the Global Fire Emission Database (GFED version\n2.1, available at: ftp:\/\/daac.ornl.gov\/data\/global vegetation\/\nfire emissions v2.1) from Randerson et al. (2007) and Van\nder Werf et al. (2006) to correct for carbon fire emissions in\nthe atmospheric inversions.\nTable 1.

Mod-\nelled absolute NEP estimates strongly depend on factors that\ncannot be taken into account (e.g. change in land-use his-\ntory) and thus are relatively meaningless. Hence, we dis-\ncuss NEP only in terms of interannual variability as previ-\nously done in other contexts (e.g., Ciais et al., 2005; Vet-\nter et al., 2008) (see below). At continental scale annual\nGPP estimates range from 16.58 to 39.68 Pg C y-1 (14\u201333%\nof global GPP (120 Pg C y-1)), and 9.16 to 17.28 Pg C y-1\nfor NPP (14\u201327% of global NPP (65 Pg C y-1)) respectively\n(Table 1). Previous modeling studies indicated mean annual\nNPP between 7 and 13 Pg C y-1 (Cramer et al., 1999; Cao et\nal., 2001; Potter, 2003). Possibly, the too extensive forest\ncover simulated by LPJ-DGVM (17.28 Pg C y-1) and OR-\nCHIDEE (15.38 Pg C y-1) may have caused an overestima-\ntion of continental scale NPP. A realistic representation of\nsavannah ecosystems is still a challenge for dynamic vegeta-\ntion models.\nThe comparison of simulated interannual variations of the\nAfrican carbon balance with atmospheric inversions reveals\na consistent pattern but some discrepancies remain (Fig. 2).\nThere is agreement of above average net uptake for 1997,\n2000, 2001, and 2006 and a below average carbon balance\nfor 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2005. The general pattern of conti-\nnental scale IAV is consistent between NEP and NBP, which\nindicates a small contribution of fire emissions on the vari-\nability of the African carbon balance in the considered pe-\nriod. Relatively low interannual variability of fire emissions\nin Africa is consistent with van der Werf et al. (2006). Some\nof the deviations between the models and the inversions is\ncertainly also related to uncertainties of the latter given that\nthe density of atmospheric CO2 measurement stations is low.\nDifferences between models are even more pronounced at\nregional level (Fig. 3). GPP numbers are similar between\nJULES, ORCHIDEE, and LPJ-DGVM for the Northern Sa-\nvannah Belt, the Central Tropical Forest, and the Southern\nRaingreen Woodland, where LPJ-Guess represents only 50\npercent of other modeled GPP numbers.

Due to the standardiza-\ntion method, 0 represents the mean of each individual distribution, but no neutral balance. NEP for models was calculated as the difference\nof GPP and TER. NEP from atmospheric inversions was calculated by removing fire emissions using GFED (van der Werf et al., 2006). NBP\nrefers to the originally inversion results, and NEP minus model specific fire emissions (except JULES, which does not simulate fire).\nthe Horn of Africa and the South African Grassland are con-\nsistent between JULES and LPJ-DGVM, but significantly\nlower for ORCHIDEE but in the same range as LPJ-Guess.\nAnnual NPP estimates are more consistent between all mod-\nels. Exceptions are lower LPJ-Guess NPP at the Northern\nSavannah Belt, twice as much higher ORCHIDEE NPP than\ninter-model average at the Central Tropical Forest, as well\nas a high and low plateau situation in the South African\nGrassland region as represented by JULES\/LPJ-DGVM and\nORCHIDEE\/LPJ-GUESS.\nDespite the discrepancies among models regarding the ab-\nsolute flux magnitudes, consistent patterns emerge between\nmodels and with satellite observations regarding seasonal\nchanges of photosynthesis in the different regions (Fig. 4).\nBoth, remotely sensed FAPAR and simulated GPP show that\nthe seasonality of photosynthesis varies in concert with rain-\nfall in all regions except for the inner tropical forest, where\nlow intra-annual variation of rainfall creates climatic con-\nditions without water limitation, reducing the effect of pre-\ncipitation on photosynthesis. The heterogeneous vegetation\nof Madagascar together with known extensive anthropogenic\ntransformations (Green and Sussman, 1990) are likely a ma-\njor reason for the disagreement between the models and be-\ntween models and remotely sensed FAPAR.\n3.2 Regions of large interannual variability\nSimilar spatial patterns of interannual variability for GPP and\nNEP are estimated by all models (Fig. 5). Despite some dif-\nferences of the patterns among the models, we can identify\nareas of large interannual variability of GPP and NEP in east\nand south Africa predicted by all models (Fig. 6). Both re-\ngions are dominated by herbaceous vegetation, including ex-\ntensive agricultural land, and are known to be strongly influ-\nenced by El Nino conditions (Plisnier et al., 2003; Kogan,\n2000). The independent remote sensing based FAPAR data\nconfirms these two variability hotspot regions (Fig. 7). How-\never, ORCHIDEE and JULES further simulate considerable\nvariability in the northern savannahs and partly in the tropical\nforest, which is not evident in the satellite observations.\n3.3 What drives NEP interannual variability \u2013 Photosyn-\nthesis or respiration?\nThe previous section indicated that regions of large inter-\nannual NEP variability are associated with also large GPP\nvariability, suggesting that variations of photosynthesis are\ndriving the variations of the net carbon balance. Table 2 fur-\nther shows that NEP anomalies in the five defined regions\nwww.biogeosciences.net\/6\/285\/2009\/ Biogeosciences, 6, 285\u2013295, 2009\n290 U. Weber et al.: Interannual variability of Africas ecosystem productivity\nFig. 3. Annual average GPP, NPP, and NEP per region (g C\/m2\/yr).\nare strongly correlated with GPP anomalies in all models. In\nmany cases anomalies of ecosystem respiration are also pos-\nitively correlated with the NEP anomalies which may appear\ncounterintuitive at first glance. If respiration would drive\nthe carbon balance we would expect negative correlations;\nthe positive correlations instead originate from the tight cou-\npling of GPP and TER in the models, which is also evident\nin eddy-covariance based, estimates of GPP and TER (e.g.\nReichstein et al., 2007; Baldocchi, 2008). In such case a pos-\nitive anomaly of TER results in a positive anomaly of NEP\nbecause the GPP increase is even higher, than the (GPP in-\nduced) TER stimulation.\nAlthough the overall pattern of GPP controlled NEP in-\nterannual variability is robust and consistent among models\nand regions, we find differences in the strength of this re-\nlationship depending on the model and region. JULES and\nLPJ-GUESS show strongest correlations between GPP and\nNEP anomalies (RGPP\/NEP>0.92) in all regions, while LPJ-\nDGVM and ORCHIDEE simulate larger inter-regional vari-\nability and slightly weaker correlations.\n4 The response of simulated gross primary production\nto meteorological conditions\nHaving identified GPP as a crucial driver of the carbon bal-\nance and the hotspot regions of largest interannual variability\nin east and South Africa, we now infer which meteorological\nconditions drive the variability of GPP.

The first two modes of the PCA of the annual\nmeteorological data explain 80% of its variability (Table 3)\nand are used to infer the primary driving factor of GPP in-\nterannual variability in the models. The first mode is most\nstrongly associated with precipitation and specific humidity\nand thus represents a gradient of moisture availability. The\nfactor loadings of the second mode show that it represents\na gradient of increasing temperature and radiation with de-\ncreasing values of mode 2.\nThe correlation maps between the first principal compo-\nnent and GPP clearly show that moisture availability is the\nmain limiting factor for photosynthesis (Fig. 8). This find-\ning is in conjunction with Williams et al.

Correlation maps between the meteoro-\nlogical PCAs and the mean annual FAPAR from SeaW-\niFS (Fig. 9) confirm that primary productivity responds to\nmoisture in south and east Africa, which are the regions of\nlargest interannual variability (see Sect. 3.2). The correla-\ntions between moisture and FAPAR on interannual scale in\nthe Northern Savannah Belt are not as extensive as indicated\nby the models. This is possibly an artifact related to the rel-\natively short time series (8 years) and coarse meteorological\ndata. Camberlin et al. (2006) found more widespread strong\ncorrelations between integrated NDVI and rainfall for a 20\nyear time series in the northern savannahs.

Correlation between modeled GPP and Meteorology PCA\n2, not significant correlations in grey (confidence interval=0.90)\nThe partly different spatial correlation patterns between\nPCA1 and GPP among the models is likely related to dif-\nferent parameterizations for water stress effects such as root\nprofiles, soil depth, and the coupling between photosynthesis\nand transpiration via canopy conductance which largely de-\ntermines soil water depletion. The simulation of water stress\neffects on photosynthesis has been previously identified as a\nmajor source for differences among models regarding inter-\nannual variability of GPP in Europe (Jung et al., 2007; Vetter\net al., 2008).\nThe general water limitation of African vegetation\u2019s pri-\nmary production is consistent with Churkina and Run-\nning (1998) based on Biome-BGC simulations and Jolly\net al. (2005) based on the analysis of remote sensing data\nfrom MODIS. Using a production efficiency model Nemani\net al. (2003) find that tropical Africa is primarily radiation\nlimited, while both Churkina and Running (1998) as well\nas Jolly et al. (2005) masked the inner tropical regions and\nconcluded that no climatic constrain limits productivity here.\nInterestingly, LPJ-DGVM and JULES also suggest that not\nrainfall but radiation limits GPP in some regions, especially\nin the inner tropics. This is represented by the negative\ncorrelations between PCA 2 and GPP in the tropical for-\nest where simulated GPP increases with increasing radiation\nand temperature (Fig. 10). Given that temperature limitation\ndoes likely not play a role here, we can interpret the neg-\native correlations between PCA2 and GPP as an indication\nfor light limitation. The latter also makes sense since fre-\nquent cloud cover is present in the tropics, which controls\nincoming radiation with otherwise favorable climatic condi-\ntions for productivity. Light limitation for parts of the Ama-\nzon tropical forests has been inferred from studying wet to\nBiogeosciences, 6, 285\u2013295, 2009 www.biogeosciences.net\/6\/285\/2009\/\nU. Weber et al.: Interannual variability of Africas ecosystem productivity 293\ndry season transitions using in-situ measurements of CO2\ngas exchange (Saleska et al., 2003), manipulative experi-\nments (Graham et al., 2002), and remote sensing based stud-\nies (Huete et al., 2006; Xiao et al., 2006; Nemani et al.,\n2003). Light limitation for parts of the Amazon result from\naccess to groundwater during dry seasons when the vegeta-\ntion capitalizes from the increases incoming radiation. From\nthe correlation maps between the remote sensing based FA-\nPAR and PCA2 we also find patches in the inner tropics of\nAfrica where productivity increases with increasing radiation\nbut to a much smaller extent than suggested by some of the\nmodels. Thus, the role of light availability in the African\ntropics remains controversial. There are several possible rea-\nsons why we find only small areas with significant corre-\nlation between radiation and productivity from the remote\nsensing data: (1) the short time series (8 years) in combina-\ntion with small variances make it difficult to achieve large\ncorrelations, (2) the uncertainty of the meteorological data\nthat originate from global reanalysis, (3) possible errors in\nthe satellite FAPAR retrievals due to subpixel cloud contam-\nination, (4) a strong role of non-climatic limitations of pro-\nductivity such as nutrients. If nutrients are not most limiting,\necosystems are more sensitive to climatic variations. Possi-\nbly, light limitation in the African tropics occurs where less\nphosphorous depleted soils are present since phosphorous is\nbelieved to be generally the main limiting factor for produc-\ntivity in the tropics (Vitousek, 1984). The overriding effect\nof nutrient availability may explain why we find only small\nareas with light limitation from the analysis using the satel-\nlite data, in contrast to the extensive areas of light limitation\nindicated by LPJ-DGVM, JULES, and Nemani et al. (2003)\nbecause none of the latter considers explicitly nutrient cycles.\n5 Conclusions\nUsing four terrestrial ecosystem models in combination with\nremote sensing based information of vegetation productivity\nwe were able to identify that (1) the largest interannual vari-\nability of gross primary production and net ecosystem pro-\nductivity are concentrated in east and south Africa, (2) inter-\nannual variations of gross primary production is driving net\necosystem production in the models, and (3) the availability\nof moisture is the primary determinant of interannual varia-\ntions of gross primary production and consequently the net\ncarbon balance.\nNevertheless, our current simulations reveal substantial\ndiscrepancies among models regarding the actual flux mag-\nnitudes. Future simulations should be performed with im-\nproved forcings by prescribing the actual distribution of veg-\netation types provided by a remote sensing based land cover\nmap and improved meteorological reanalysis. In addition it\nshould be investigated to what extent the models are able to\nreproduce the ecological patterns found in the synthesis of in-\nsitu measurements of carbon and water fluxes across Africa\n(Merbold et al., 2009). Given the significance of moisture\ncontrol on the carbon fluxes in most parts of Africa, particu-\nlar attention should be dedicated to the models\u2019 ability to ac-\ncurately simulate soil hydrological conditions, and the sensi-\ntivity of photosynthesis and soil respiration to soil moisture.\nAcknowledgements.
