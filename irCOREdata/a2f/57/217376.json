BELL, MUSTAFA F. \u00d6ZBILGIN, \nT. ALEXANDRA BEAUREGARD, AND OLCA S\u00dcRGEVIL \n \nEmployee voice has been largely examined as a universal concept in unionized and \nnon-unionized settings, with insuffi cient attention to diversity of workers (Rank, \n2009). As invisible minorities, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) \nemployees provide a valuable focal point from which to examine employee voice \nmechanisms. Positing that GLBT employees are often silenced by what is perceived \nas \u201cnormal\u201d in work organizations, this paper identifi es some of the negative \nconsequences of this silencing and proposes ways in which the voices of GLBT \nemployees and other invisible minorities can be heard. With its relevance to policies \nand practices in other organizations, the \u201cDon\u2019t ask; don\u2019t tell\u201d policy of the U.S. \nmilitary is used as a lens through which to analyze voice, silence, and GLBT \nemployees in other organizations. Heterosexist environments can foster \norganizational climates of silence, where the feeling that speaking up is futile or \ndangerous is widespread among employees. Specifi c recommendations are \nprovided for HR managers to facilitate the expression of voice for GLBT employees in \ntoday\u2019s increasingly diverse organizations.  \n \nKeywords: sexual orientation; GLBT; diversity; voice; silence; inclusion; gay, lesbian, \nbisexual, and transgender \nIn the May 2009 issue of DiversityInc., a PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) \nadvertisement on the prominent inside front cover focused on voice, silence, and \ndiversity. Although sexual orientation was not explicitly mentioned, it was implied by \nthe speaker\u2019s struggle with whether to answer a simple question commonly \nexchanged among colleagues. \u201cI wonder if people really want to know how I spent \nmy weekend?\u201d \u201cWhen they ask me, I sometimes avoid the question.\u201d \u201cWhen I focus \ntoo much on what people might think, I\u2019m not being true to myself.\u201d \u201cWhen I am true \nto myself, I worry that people will only see what I am rather than who I am.\u201d (\u201cWho \nam I?\u201d, 2009 [Advertisement]). The ad directs interested readers to PWC\u2019s diversity \nwebsite, which describes PWC as \u201cA culture where every voice matters\u201d \n(http:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/about-us\/diversity\/pwc-diversity.jhtml). \n \nHirschman (1970) defined voice as \u201cany attempt at all to change, rather than to \nescape from, an objectionable state of affairs, whether through individual or \ncollective petition to the management directly in charge, through appeal to a higher \nauthority with the intention of forcing a change in management, or through various \ntypes of actions and protests, including those that are meant to mobilize public \nopinion\u201d (p. 30). Most studies of employee voice to date have drawn on Hirschman\u2019s \nframing and have often treated voice as a universal concept that applies to all \nworkers. As such, the voices of minorities in general and gay, lesbian, bisexual, and \ntransgender (GLBT) employees in particular have been neglected in much of the \nacademic research on employee voice. Furthermore, partly due to their invisibility, \novert discrimination, and lack of widespread protective legislation, GLBT employees \nare at high risk of silencing at work. In this context, they experience double jeopardy \n- diminished voice at work and limited research attention on their voice experiences. \nCreed (2003) argued that \u201cit matters whose voices and silence we consider; the \nnatures of both voice and silence may vary across identity groups that have different \nhistorical legacies of oppression and avenues of resistance\u201d (p. 1507). This paper \nidentifies the voices and silence of GLBT employees. \n \nThis paper proposes that it is particularly compelling to study voice (and silence) \nwhen the \u201cobjectionable state of affairs\u201d at work is directly relevant to something \nthat is invisible, but which is at the core of workers\u2019 identity, such as sexual \norientation. We examine relationships between employee voice mechanisms and \nthe increasing diversity of workforces, with a particular focus on GLBT employees, \nwho are often silenced by what is perceived as \u201cnormal\u201d in formal organizations. \nWe consider some of the negative consequences of this silencing and propose ways \nin which the voices of GLBT employees and other invisible minorities can be heard. \nWe begin by positing that sexual orientation is an invisible, but important, aspect of \ndiversity. Next, we analyze voice, silence, and GLBT employees, focusing on the \n\u201cDon\u2019t ask; don\u2019t tell\u201d policy of the U.S. military. We demonstrate its relevance, \nhowever, to policies and practices that silence GLBT individuals in many other \norganizations and national contexts. Lastly, we provide specific recommendations \nfor HR managers seeking to give voice to GLBT employees in increasingly diverse \norganizations. \n \nSexual Orientation as an (Invisible) Aspect of Diversity \n \nIn the United States, although research on race and sex differences in management \nstyle, leadership, and opportunities has existed for many years, significant and \nfocused attention to diversity issues began after Johnston and Packer\u2019s (1987) \nWorkforce 2000. In groundbreaking work, they predicted that by the year 2000, 85% \nof the net new entrants to the U.S. workforce would be women and minorities, \nproviding employers with a strong impetus to consider the effects of increasing \nrace and sex diversity on their organizations (Bell, 2007). In the more than two \ndecades since Workforce 2000 stimulated researchers\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 attention \nto the topic, it is now apparent that 21st-century workforces have not just changed \nin terms of race and sex, but also of age, religion, work and family needs, and \nopenness about sexual orientation. Indeed, researchers now include sexual \norientation in definitions of diversity (e.g., Bell, 2007; Harvey & Allard, 2002). \nSexual orientation diversity is a key part of today\u2019s workplaces. An estimated 8.8 \nmillion gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals live in the United States and an \nestimated 3.7 million live in the United Kingdom (Erens, McManus, Prescott, & Field, \n2003; Gates, 2006). While it is difficult to ascertain how many of these individuals \nare in the labor force, U.S. Census data reveal that more than 86% of men and \nwomen in same-sex couples are employed, and that employment probabilities for \ngay men and lesbians lie below those of married heterosexual men, but above those \nof heterosexual women (Leppel, 2009). This suggests that increasing workforce \ndiversity, reflecting trends toward an aging population, greater ethnic diversity, and \nmore women taking up positions in paid work (Gallagher & O\u2019Leary, 2007; Williams \n& Jones, 2005), is also likely to include more GLBT employees. These population and \nworkforce changes are also associated with significant changes in the way work will \nbe organized and manifested in the near future, including distributing and enacting \nvoice in organizational settings. \n \nDespite the now widely recognized importance of attending to diversity in research \nand practice, some aspects of diversity, in particular race and sex, receive \nconsiderably more attention than others. This is due in part to the historical \nresistance to discriminating against racial minorities and women and partly due to \nthe ease of identifying race and sex. Visible attributes are more easily accessible to \nuse in decision making, stereotyping, and categorizing at work than those that are \ninvisible (Dworkin & Dworkin, 1999), such as sexual orientation. Thus, despite the \nclear relevance of GLBT employees\u2019 experiences to diversity in organizations \nregarding discrimination, harassment, stereotyping, and exclusion at work (Day & \nSchoenrade, 1997; Dietch, Butz, & Brief, 2004; Waldo, 1999), they are often \noverlooked in studies of diversity and of voice. In the same vein, GLBT equality is \nconsidered taboo or even unlawful across several societies and countries (Jonsen, \nMaznevski, & Schneider, in press). Bowen and Blackmon (2003) suggested that \n\u201cmanaging \u2018invisible diversity\u2019 may be just as crucial as (managing) \u2018visible  \ndiversity\u2019\u2026 but provides additional challenges since individuals may choose to \nconceal or evade, rather than speak up about their differences\u201d (p. 1395). The option \nto conceal one\u2019s sexual orientation is sometimes used strategically (see Creed, \n2003), but, as we will discuss, concealment comes with a host of negative \nconsequences for both individuals and the organizations that employ them (Beatty & \nKirby, 2006; Day & Schoenrade, 1997; Ragins & Cornwell, 2001; Rostosky & Riggle, \n2002).  \n \nIn addition to invisibility, the traditional heterosexual social structures, morals, social \nmores, fundamentalist religious (see Hunsberger, 1996) beliefs, homophobia, and \ninadequate legal protections in many places are related to discrimination against \nGLBT individuals (Lubensky, Holland, Wiethoff, & Crosby, 2004). Discrimination  \nbased on sexual orientation has been referred to as the last acceptable prejudice \nand creates tremendous problems for individuals and the organizations in which \nthey work. Being forced to remain closeted, living with the fear of being terminated, \nand lack of partner benefits are just a few of the concerns unique to GLBT  \nemployees. Supportive human resource management practices that encourage \nopenness and reject discriminatory practices, however, can make a difference. For \nexample, researchers have found that GLBT employees who were \u201cout\u201d (had publicly \ndisclosed their sexual orientation) at work had higher affective commitment and job \nsatisfaction and viewed top management as being more supportive. Those who were \nout also had lower conflict between work and home, lower role ambiguity, and \nlower role conflict (Day & Schoenrade, 1997). Decisions about disclosure are related \nto perceptions of the climate for GLBT employees, including perceived managerial \nand peer attitudes and organizational policies (Griffith & Hebl, 2002; Huffman, \nWatrous-Rodriguez, & King, 2008; Ragins, 2008). \n \nAs diversity among employees and applicants has been increasing, changes have \noccurred in contemporary voice mechanisms, especially in the last decade (Dundon, \nWilkinson, Marchington, & Ackers, 2005; Wilkinson, Dundon, Marchington, & Ackers, \n2004). Grievance systems, collective bargaining, suggestion boxes, open door \npolicies, employee participation, participative performance appraisals, and \ncomputer-mediated communication are included in the formal mechanisms for \nemployee voice (Bishop & Levine, 1999; Roberts, 2002). More recently, new voice \nmechanisms, such as affinity, networking, and employee resource groups, have \nemerged. These new mechanisms consist of employer-recognized, but employee-\nrun, groups of workers who share a common identity, characteristic, or set of \ninterests. They provide members with opportunities to network, support, exchange \ninformation and ideas with one another, and plan sponsored activities. For example, \nthe LAMBDA employee affinity group at Oracle has participated in educating \nemployees regarding GLBT perspectives, sponsors social events for GLBT members \nand friends, and provides links to GLBT communities and events around the world \n(Oracle, 2010). \n \nGLBT Employees in Diversity and Voice Literatures \n \nTo establish the foundation for our discussion, we now define key terms relevant to \nGLBT employees and voice (Table I). Heterosexism is \u201can ideological system that \ndenies, denigrates, and stigmatizes any nonheterosexual behavior, relationship, \nidentity, or community\u201d (Herek, 1993, p. 90). Such a system normalizes and \nprivileges heterosexuality (Waldo, 1999, p. 218), results in institutional and \ninterpersonal prejudice and social stigma for GLBT individuals, and is inherently \nsilencing to them. Many GLBT employees express fears and experiences of  \nharassment, discrimination, and termination at work (Day & Schoenrade, 1997; \nDietch et al., 2004; Graham, 1986; Levine & Leonard, 1984; Ragins & Cornwell, \n2001), prompting their efforts to remain \u201cinvisible\u201d and fit in with the heterosexual \nmainstream. Early work by Levine and Leonard (1984) identified formal and informal \ndiscrimination against those who are GLBT. Formal discrimination consists of firing or \nnot hiring someone on the basis of his or her sexual orientation (see Cracker Barrel \nin Bell, 2007, p. 435), being passed over for promotions and raises, and being \nexcluded from benefits such as insurance and family leave. Informal discrimination \nagainst GLBT employees includes harassment and loss of credibility and lack of \nacceptance and respect by co-workers and supervisors (Croteau, 1996; Levine & \nLeonard, 1984). Ragins and Cornwell (2001) found that GLBT employees who \nperceived high levels of sexual orientation discrimination in their workplace had \nmore negative job attitudes, felt lower satisfaction, and thought that they had fewer \nopportunities for promotion. Research indicates that everyone (regardless of sexual \norientation) working in a heterosexist climate, in which behaviors such as anti-gay \njokes are accepted as common practice, can experience reduced psychological well-\nbeing (Silverschanz, Cortina, Konik, & Magley, 2008).  \n \nIn such hostile environments, the decision not to disclose sexual orientation would \nappear to be a reasonable decision. Not disclosing, however, is associated with \nnegative consequences that may rival those of harassment, discrimination, and \ntermination (Bell, 2007). Some GLBT employees construct heterosexual partners, \nbring opposite-sex friends as pretend partners to company events, and spend \nconsiderable energy trying to avoid speaking of their real, same-sex partners \nwhile at work (\u00d6zbilgin & Woodward, 2003). Such concealment detracts from \nconstructive, productive behaviors (see Beatty & Kirby, 2006). Hewlin (2009) argued \nthat minority employees sometimes create facades of conformity that can result in \nemotional exhaustion and intentions to quit. In his research on heterosexism as \nminority stress, Waldo (1999) found GLBT employees who were more out and those \nwho were more closeted experienced minority stress and associated negative \npsychological, physical, and job-related outcomes. He surmised that those who are \nmore out experience direct heterosexism and those who are more closeted \nexperience stress from others\u2019 assuming they are heterosexual. Waldo \nrecommended that GLBT individuals consciously choose employers that do not \ntolerate heterosexism. \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nInclusion refers to \u201ca person\u2019s ability to ontribute fully and effectively to an \norganization\u201d (Roberson, 2006, p. 215). The invisibility of sexual orientation and \ncertain other diversity attributes warrants creating a culture of inclusion in which the \n\u201cdifferent voices of a diverse workforce are respected and heard\u201d (Pless & Maak, \n2004, pp. 130\u2013131). In such cultures, those with invisible differences know they can \nbe comfortable making known their differences (e.g., being out, belonging to a \nminority religious group, or having another invisible difference). Thus, in addition to \ndiversity as a concept, many researchers and practitioners now consider inclusion \ncritical to unlocking the potential contribution of individual differences at work \n(Roberson, 2006; Society for Human Resource Management [SHRM], 2008). For \nexample, in 2008, SHRM hosted its first Global Leadership Summit on Diversity and \nInclusion, bringing together 100 \u201cglobal diversity thought leaders\u201d from industry and \nacademia to discuss pressing diversity and inclusion issues for the 21st century. In \ndiverse and inclusive cultures, people are recognized as being different, yet they are \nalso recognized and valued as equally free organizational citizens, with the same \nrights as everyone else and knowing \u201cthey can be their true selves, not only in \nprivate but also at the workplace\u201d (Pless & Maak, 2004, p. 132). For GLBT employees, \nthe ability to be \u201cout\u201d at work and to have the same rights, benefits, and privileges \nas everyone else is a key aspect of voice. When both diversity and inclusion exist, \nemployees \u201cfeel a sense of belonging, and inclusive behaviors such as eliciting and \nvaluing contributions from all employees are part of the daily life in the \norganization\u201d (emphasis added; Lirio, Lee, Williams, Haugen, & Kossek, 2008, p. 448, \nciting Miller & Katz, 2002). Eliciting and valuing employees\u2019 contributions are also \nkey attributes of voice. \n \nAs discussed, voice includes attempts to change, rather than escape from, \nobjectionable affairs at work (Hirschman, 1970) and has multiple manifestations. \nPerhaps most relevant to GLBT employees is the concept of quiescent or defensive \nvoice, designed to protect oneself from abuse or mistreatment (Ellis & Van Dyne, \n2009; Pinder & Harlos, 2001), as may occur in environments that are heterosexist or \nhostile to GLBT employees. In contrast, acquiescent voice refers to disengaged \nexpressions based on resignation, which may manifest as GLBT staff\u2019s withdrawing \nfrom social aspects of work. Last, Van Dyne, Ang, and Botero (2003) described \npro-social voice as expressing ideas, information, and opinions in constructive ways \nto improve work and organizations based on cooperative motives. This resonates \nwith the notion of GLBT workers as \u201ctempered radicals\u201d (Meyerson, 2001), workers \nwho subscribe to often unstated radical plans for positive social change and whose \nradicalism is curbed only by organizational norms. \n \nSilence is employees\u2019 intentional, conscious decision to withhold their opinions and \nconcerns about organizational problems or issues (Johannesen, 1974; Morrison & \nMilliken, 2000, p. 707). Like voice, silence is multifaceted and can be quiescent or \ndefensive, acquiescent or pro-social. \n \nQuiescent or defensive silence refers to the self-protective and more active behavior \nbased on fear that the consequences of speaking up will be personally costly \n(Morrison & Milliken, 2000; Pinder & Harlos, 2001), while acquiescent silence refers \nto disengaged behavior based on resignation (Pinder & Harlos, 2001; Van Dyne et al., \n2003). Acquiescent silence is passive and entrenched, in which employees have \ngiven up hope for improvement and have accepted the problematic state (Van Dyne \net al., 2003). Last, pro-social silence is withholding \u201cideas, information, or opinions \nwith the goal of benefiting other people or the organization\u2014based on altruism or \ncooperative motives\u201d (Van Dyne et al., 2003, pp. 1366\u20131367). For GLBT employees \nand allies, silence about discrimination, harassment, benefits, or other inequalities \ncan thus be viewed through quiescent, acquiescent, defensive, and pro-social lenses. \nWhen fear of harassment, termination, or other negative consequences exists, \nacquiescent or defensive silence may result. When there is no hope of change, \nfor example, silence may exist as a form of resignation. Pro-social silence of allies \nmay occur when others fear for their GLBT friends and colleagues in an organization. \n \nAccording to Bowen and Blackmon (2003), the interaction between an employee\u2019s \npersonal characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation) and the \ncontext within which the employee operates determines voice and silence. Morrison \nand Milliken (2000) note that it may be \u201cespecially difficult\u201d for some organizations \n\u201cto respond appropriately to the diversity of values, beliefs, and characteristics that \nincreasingly characterize the workforce\u201d (p. 721). Bowen and Blackmon (2003) \nspecifically focused on the sexual orientation dimension of diversity as an invisible \ndifference, noting that if GLBT employees feel that expressing their personal identity \nis unacceptable at work, they will not share their experiences and speak up. Conklin \n(2004) presented a troubling story of a gay white man who tells of how his sexual \norientation presents ongoing challenges at work. The man describes trying to appear \nmore masculine, not volunteering information about himself that could make \nheterosexual white men uncomfortable, adopting heterosexual male behaviors such \nas dominating women, and remaining silent when GLBT employees are ridiculed or \nexcluded in subtle ways or when assumptions are made that everyone is \nheterosexual (Conklin, 2004). Common across all forms of silence that GLBT \nemployees may enact is that silence as an organizational act is often symptomatic of \norganizational processes, structures, and work cultures (see Morrison & Milliken, \n2000) that are hostile to including GLBT employees. The \u201cDon\u2019t ask; don\u2019t tell\u201d policy \nof the U.S. military serves as an illustrative case of promoting silence as a policy for \ndealing with sexual orientation diversity at work. \n \n\u201cDon\u2019t Ask; Don\u2019t Tell\u201d and Climates of Silence \n \nIn the 2010 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama vowed to repeal the \nofficial U.S. military policy on homosexuality: \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell, don\u2019t pursue, \ndon\u2019t harass.\u201d More commonly known as simply \u201cDon\u2019t ask; don\u2019t tell,\u201d this policy \nhas been a clear and pointed expression of denying voice and a specific requirement \nto be silent. Under this policy, military service members have been prohibited from \narticulating their minority sexual orientation, and others have been prohibited from \nasking if personnel are gay (Lubensky et al., 2004). If their minority sexual \norientation became known, U.S. military personnel have run the risk of being \ndischarged (e.g., fired). Senator Carl Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, opened a February 2010 congressional hearing into the repeal \nof the policy by stating that approximately 13,500 gay men and lesbians had been \nforced to leave the military since the policy was implemented (O\u2019Keefe, 2010). \nDuring that period, some level of asking and telling had, in fact, been occurring. \nAs evidence of further discrimination and power disparities, those discharged have \ndisproportionately been enlisted personnel, rather than officers. For example, in one \nfive-year period only 75 of the 6,300 discharged for being homosexual were officers \n(Fouhy, 2004). Further, women have been significantly more likely to be discharged \nthan men, making up 15% of the military, but 29% of those discharged under \u201cDon\u2019t \nask; don\u2019t tell\u201d (Fouhy, 2004). Researchers have suggested that many women have \nbeen discharged under the policy after refusing men\u2019s sexual advances (Human \nRights Campaign, 2004), another act of suppressing voice. \n \nWhile the specifics of the \u201cDon\u2019t ask; don\u2019t tell\u201d policy are unique to the U.S. military, \nprohibitions against homosexuality currently exist or once existed in other militaries \nin the past as well. Further, in many other organizations, unwritten rules similar to \nthe \u201cDon\u2019t ask; don\u2019t tell\u201d policy exist, and these rules can silence employees,  \nresulting in negative individual and organizational consequences. For example, as \nthe quote at the opening of the article suggests, GLBT staff may fear answering \ninnocuous questions regarding what they did over the weekend from co-workers \nengaging in normal workplace small talk. Even absent specific directives not to ask or \ntell, colleagues may learn not to ask (e.g., pro-social silence) via evasive responses \nfrom GLBT colleagues who know that not telling (e.g., quiescent silence) may be \nsafer. Both military and nonmilitary organizations could learn from the destructive \nconsequences of silencing (see Day & Greene, 2008) of personnel without legitimate \nreason. At the most obvious level, firing large numbers of qualified personnel \nnegatively affects an organization\u2019s effectiveness. For example, in 2003, nine \nlinguists were discharged from the U.S. military, including speakers of Arabic; at the \ntime, concerns were expressed that \u201cDon\u2019t ask; don\u2019t tell\u201d was endangering national \nsecurity (Webley, 2010). Of course, it would be wise also to consider the negative \nconsequences of silence among all personnel on the effectiveness of communication \nin the organization. \n \nAccording to Morrison and Milliken (2000, p. 721), climates of silence exist when \npowerful systemic forces create organizational silence\u2014widely shared perceptions \nthat speaking up is not worth the effort or is downright dangerous. In his article \ntitled \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell: Secrets\u2014their use and abuse in organizations,\u201d Keane \n(2008, p. 107) explained that secrets can hinder communication and assert cognitive \nand social controls. Although Keane\u2019s article was not about secrecy relating to sexual \norientation or the U.S. military, the impact of secrecy about sexual orientation on \ncommunication and cognitive and social controls and the broad organizational \nrelevance is clear. Being forced to remain closeted to avoid termination is one way in \nwhich GLBT employees are silenced (Colgan, Wright, Creegan, & McKearney, 2009). \nFears of termination may be extreme. Yet even without such extremes, the many \nheterosexist factors that exist in organizations are silencing. For example, with most \nbenefits programs requiring marriage for partners to qualify for medical, dental, and \nretirement benefits, in many organizations partnered GLBT employees are \nautomatically silenced. In the absence of legislation that allows same-sex partners to \nmarry, proactive organizational leaders must implement their own equitable \nbenefits programs (Hannah, 2009). They may or may not do so, depending on the \ncommitment to equality, inclusion, and voice for all employees and upon the \ninfluential power of GLBT employees and allies (see Day & Greene, 2008) in \nsupporting equal benefits. \n \nVoice Mechanisms for GLBT Employees  \n \nVarious mechanisms provide employees with the opportunity to express their voice \n(Benson & Brown, 2010). Among these are legal regulations, trade unions, and \nspecific GLBT and human rights organizations, which will be explored in this section. \nLegislation can be helpful in reducing the silence of racial and ethnic minorities, but \nthe legal case for sexual orientation equality is relatively new and weaker compared \nto other forms of antidiscriminatory legislation (Colgan, Creegan, McKearney, & \nWright, 2007). In the United Kingdom, the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) \nRegulations were implemented in December 2003 to offer protection against sexual \norientation discrimination at work (Chartered Institute of Personnel and \nDevelopment [CIPD], 2009). In the United States, there is no widespread federal \nlegislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Some \nstates, including Wisconsin, Connecticut, California, Hawaii, Minnesota, and New \nJersey, do prohibit such discrimination, yet in the absence of such prohibitions or \nlocal laws, one can be fired for being (or being perceived as) gay.  \n \nIn 32 states, where no legislation exists to protect individuals against discrimination \non the basis of sexual orientation, trade union membership can be a legal protection \nfor GLBT employees. Indeed, employee voice has been seen as a traditional function \nof trade unions; however, in recent decades, union membership has been declining, \nrendering this voice mechanism less powerful than it once was (Urwin, Murphy, & \nMichielsens, 2007). Even where employee voice is legally protected by trade unions, \nhowever, GLBT employees can still remain silent. As Benson and Brown (2010) \nnoted, unions differ in their capacity to represent their members. Research by \nMorehead, Steele, Alexander, Stephen, and Duffin (1997) demonstrated that only \n24% of unionized workplaces in Australia were characterized as active, with senior \ndelegates present, membership meetings held, and negotiations taking place \nbetween management and labor. More than three-quarters of Australian unionized \nworkplaces did not have a union structure that could provide for employee voice. \n \nActive unions can present their own problems for GLBT employees\u2019 expressing voice. \nResearch in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom has established that \nminority groups encounter several structural and cultural barriers to participating in \ntrade unions (Hunt & Rayside, 2000). If GLBT employees can participate in union \nprocesses, their representation by unions might prove useful (Greene & Kirton, \n2006). White, heterosexual men, however, have dominated the governing bodies \nand decision-making structures of most unions and have therefore been able to \ninfluence policies and practices to reflect their own interests (Kirton & Greene, \n2002). The unrepresentative nature of union leadership restricts the ability of unions \nto promote equality, diversity, and inclusion in employment effectively (Kirton & \nGreene, 2002; Trebilcock, 1991). While many unions are making strides in adopting \nstructural and organizational changes to improve member equality, equal priority is \nnot given to all groups; indeed, sex and racial equality has been pursued more \nenergetically than equality for GLBT employees (Kirton & Greene, 2005). Recent and \nnotable exceptions are evident to this rule; for example, the president of the Retail, \nWholesale and Department Store Union, which represents 100,000 workers in both \nthe United States and Canada, recently outed himself and stated a commitment \nto same-sex spousal benefits (Weinthal, 2009). Nevertheless, the secretary-treasurer \nof the Office and Professional Employees International Union has stated that \u201cvery \nfew national labor leaders are on board with this fight\u201d (Weinthal, 2009). \n \nIn summary, when coupled with the lack of physical markers to differentiate GLBT \nindividuals from heterosexuals, the absence of legal protections in many locations, \nthe relative lack of union support, and the widespread negative attitudes toward \nhomosexuality may result in more silence for GLBT employees than for other \nminorities. Researchers have suggested that defensive silence, due to fear, or \nacquiescent silence, due to giving up hope for change, can lead to further \ndisengagement and withdrawal and ultimately include turnover (Brinsfield, \nEdwards, & Greenberg, 2009; Pinder & Harlos, 2001). As a result, both those who are \nsilenced and their employers suffer.  \n \nWe contend that managing diversity and inclusion effectively would include \nmechanisms of voice through which individual differences are recognized and \norganizational measures taken to accommodate those differences in the processes \nof decision making and career development (e.g., inclusive environments). Because \nthe United States and many other countries do not have adequate prohibitions \nagainst discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and due to widespread \nresistance against equality for GLBT in some areas, leaders concerned with voice for \nall workers must take specific steps to let GLBT employees know their voices will be \nvalued rather than silenced. Breaking the cycle of invisibility and silence by allowing \nGLBT employees space to make positive contributions to work, unhindered by fear of \nviolence, prejudice, discrimination, and harassment, can shift the status quo. To \nreach this aim, organizations need to develop voice mechanisms that include GLBT \nemployees\u2019 specific needs in the workforce (Conklin, 2004). \n \nRecommendations for Human Resources Managers \n \nAs indicated, voice is a mechanism through which workers can effect organizational \nchange, but transformation of workforces and dominant practices render traditional \nmechanisms of voice ineffective in capturing the demands of workers from diverse \nbackgrounds. In this context, there is a need to introduce new and transformed \nmechanisms of voice that use systems and structures relevant to both new forms of \nwork and increasingly diverse profiles of current and potential workers. Given the \ncontentious and politicized nature of equality for GLBT employees, proactive leaders \nmust implement policies and practices that support equality and indicate voice, even \nin the absence of legislation. Such policies may be more meaningful to employees \nand effective if implemented without the coercion of legislation, as doing so speaks \nvolumes to employees and constituent groups of the organization\u2019s level of \ncommitment to equality. An obvious expression of commitment to sexual \norientation equality is a widely communicated non-discrimination policy. \n \nIn taking a proactive stance for inclusion, leaders can draw a rich repertoire of \nspecific voice techniques from the literature. Dundon et al. (2005) subdivided voice \nin large organizations into four principal strands of thought: first, voice as an \narticulation of individual dissatisfaction (such as complaints to line managers, \ngrievance procedures, speak-up programs); second, voice as the expression of \ncollective organization (such as union recognition, collective bargaining, industrial \naction); third, voice as a form of contribution to management decision making (such \nas upward problemsolving groups, quality circles, suggestion programs, attitude \nsurveys, self-managed teams); fourth, voice as a form of mutuality (such as \npartnership agreements, joint consultative committees, and works councils, which \nare common in Western Europe; see Lewin & Mitchell, 1992). What matters in \napplying these mechanisms to promote voice is introducing methods that allow \nworkers whose voices have previously not been heard to participate. See Table II for \napplications of these voice mechanisms as they apply to GLBT employees and other \ninvisible minorities.1 \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nFor GLBT employees, these four subdivisions of voice should have specific \ncharacteristics to facilitate voice. For the articulation of individual dissatisfaction, \nmultiple mechanisms should exist for both GLBT employees and allies to bring forth \ncomplaints about discrimination, harassment, and exclusion. These mechanisms may \nbe real or virtual, anonymous or open. Allowing for anonymous complaints respects \nthe choice of some employees to remain closeted at work. While traditional \nmechanisms are generally real (in person) and open, voice mechanisms for GLBT \nemployees may need to be virtual or anonymous, especially if the context of work \ncould be particularly hostile to sexual orientation diversity. Although the ultimate \naim is to offer real and open systems to disclose dissatisfaction, the current context \nof the workplace should be considered in designing voice mechanisms for GLBT \nworkers if they are to be used. Providing workers with opportunities to express their \ndissatisfaction to line managers and making available grievance procedures and \nspeak-up programs would help not only GLBT employees, but all of an organization\u2019s \nworkers. More unique to GLBT employees would be to provide experts to deal with \nthe dissatisfaction engendered by harassment, silence, or GLBT-specific issues. \nImportant, too, is the availability of complaint channels that are free of further risk \nof harassment and bullying. Some organizations outsource their employee complaint \nservices to specialized external agencies to ensure employees are adequately \nprotected from harassment and bullying at work. \n \nFor the expression of collective organization, organizations can legitimate the voice \nof GLBT employee networks in trade unions, works councils, and other collective \ninstitutions. Creating networks of diversity and equality at work to include sexual \norientation issues is a good starting point. Initially, options to network off-site may \n                                                 \n1 Efforts to include other invisible minority groups (e.g., religious minorities who do not wear \ndistinctive religious attire or people with stigmatized, invisible disabilities) could benefit \nfrom similar applications of these recommendations. \nbe necessary. Once such networks are established, effective mechanisms to leverage \ndiversity and eliminate inequality, discrimination, and harassment should be \nintroduced. An intra-organizational GLBT network might also facilitate discussion \namong GLBT workers to help identify, and potentially resolve, issues related to \nworkplace dissatisfaction. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development in \nthe United Kingdom recommends that to \u201cmainstream\u201d GLBT employees in the \nworkplace, organizations should work with trade union representatives and GLBT \nemployee networks to foster engagement with the diversity agenda (CIPD, 2009). \nThis could include inviting sexual orientation network members to become diversity \ncouncil representatives.  \n \nVoice as a form of contribution to management decision making is particularly \nimportant in that management decision making plays a key role in behaviors at \nwork. When management clearly articulates that GLBT employees are valued \ncontributors to organizational success, and that heterosexism is not tolerated \n(Waldo, 1999), GLBT employees are more comfortable being out. What is not \nproperly funded in terms of staffing and financial resources often falls outside the \nfocus of decision-making mechanisms at work. Adequate resourcing of GLBT \ninitiatives, therefore, is important. Similarly, for GLBT issues to be mainstreamed in \ndecision processes at work, organizations should introduce GLBT monitoring in their \nhuman resource reporting systems. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) includes such \nmonitoring as part of their award measurement criteria. Barron (2009) noted the \nimportance of legislation prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in reducing \nhiring discrimination and prejudice. Although introduced multiple times, federal \nlegislation prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination has continually failed to pass \nin the United States. Further, even when such protective laws are enacted or policies \nsuch as \u201cDon\u2019t ask; don\u2019t tell\u201d are repealed, it may take years (and overt actions from \nleaders) before the hostile and heteronormative climate in organizations is changed \nsuch that GLBT employees are comfortable being out (Harding & Peel, 2007; Poulin, \nGouliquer, & Moore, 2009) and treated fairly. As mentioned, it is important for \norganizations to attend deliberately to fairness toward GLBT employees in HR  \nprocesses with or without specific legislation. \n \nDiversity training and education should also include diversity in sexual orientation as \nit can help prevent discrimination by raising awareness, creating open dialogue, and \nreducing misperceptions, stereotypes, and fears (Bell, Connerley, & Cocchiara, \n2009). Day and Greene (2008) suggested that organizations should include teaching \nby example, by diversity training, and through openly gay and lesbian employees as \nteachers. All workers should be educated on the organization\u2019s stance regarding \ndiversity and inclusion\u2014and that it includes sexual orientation\u2014regardless of \nwhether or not there is protective legislation in a particular locale. Huffman et al. \n(2008) recommended that diversity training include support-based training, \nemphasizing how to be a fair and supportive colleague or supervisor to GLBT \nemployees.  \n \nFinally, voice as a form of mutuality could mean bringing in representatives of GLBT \ninternal and external networks to build effective ties with the organization. GLBT \nrights campaign groups and human rights associations such as Stonewall in the \nUnited Kingdom, the HRC, and Pride at Work in the United States help provide \navenues for employee voice outside the employing organization. Developing ties \nwith such groups can facilitate transferring progressive practices elsewhere to the \norganization, bringing the organization in line with contemporary voice mechanisms. \nIdentifying high-profile sexual orientation champions at work can also enhance the \nprofile of GLBT issues and help integrate these issues into the strategic decision \nmaking at work. Doing so can also signal that being GLBT is accepted both in theory \nand in practice, as GLBT employees are represented in high-level positions, without \npenalty. Further, GLBT-friendly workplaces can apply for \u201cequality badges\u201d offered \nby external organizations such as Stonewall and to be designated a \u201cgay-friendly \nemployer.\u201d Organizations can apply for such recognition to validate the merits of \ntheir policies externally and promote their organization as being welcoming to GLBT \ncustomers and workers. \n \nFor example, the HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index is a report card on lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, and transgender equality in corporate America. Since 2002, HRC has \npublished company ratings on such things as fully inclusive nondiscrimination \npolicies, equal benefits, and GLBT resource groups. Employers that receive a 100% \nrating are recognized as \u201cBest Places to Work for LBGT Equality\u201d and are invited to \nuse the award recognition in their recruiting and advertising efforts. Applications for \nthis recognition are increasing, as are the number of employers receiving a perfect \nscore. In 2002, the first year of such recognition, only 13 employers earned a perfect \nscore. By 2009, 260 employers, representing 9.3 million employees, did so. By 2010, \n305 employers received a perfect rating, including 58 that received it for the first \ntime (Human Rights Campaign, 2010). Even in the absence of widespread legislation, \nclearly, organizations are seeing value in such recognition and validation of their \nefforts toward equality for GLBT employees.  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn this article, we have argued that increasing workforce diversity necessitates new \nand different voice mechanisms. We have provided a typology of recognized voice \nmechanisms, appropriately applied to GLBT employees, which can be used to give \nvoice to GLBT individuals at work and thus create a culture of inclusion. Voice and its \nrelationships with diversity and inclusion are critical to the success of cultural change \nmanagement efforts. Only by managing diversity effectively across a growing set of \nstrands and myriad intersections of these strands will organizations capture the \nvoices of all workers in their ongoing processes of organizational change. This \nrequires organizational leaders, as change agents, to understand the dynamics of \ntheir organizational and national context (Tatli & \u00d6zbilgin, 2009) and recognize a \nwider repertoire of voice mechanisms that can cater to different constituent groups \nin workplaces. In his work on diversity, inclusion, and voice, Rank (2009) explained \nthat organizational leaders should move away from command-and control-based \nmanagerial approaches toward encouraging participation and developing trust to \npromote use of voice by non-traditional workers. For GLBT employees, managing \ndiversity should consider aspects of inclusion that specifically consider their \nparticular, unique concerns (see Roberson, 2006). If these concerns are addressed, \norganizations can expect higher levels of satisfaction, organizational commitment, \nand positive work attitudes from GLBT employees (Ragins & Cornwell, 2001). The \nestimated 8.8 million GLBT individuals in the United States and nearly four million in \nthe United Kingdom are valuable current or potential employees, customers with \nsignificant purchasing power, and stakeholders with interest and influence. As Cox \nand Blake (1991) illustrated, employers that value diversity will have advantages in \nterms of attracting and retaining workers. Similarly, as mentioned, Waldo (1999) \nrecommended GLBT employees make conscious efforts to seek organizations that \nare intolerant of heterosexism. The efforts of organizations such as the HRC to \nidentify and publicize companies that support equality for GLBT employees \nunderscore the increasing importance of specific efforts to include GLBT employees \nin diversity and inclusion efforts. In addition, some heterosexuals seek to work in \nand are more engaged with inclusive companies (Hannah, 2009, p. 110). \n \nAside from obvious business benefits, moral and social cases can be made for \nproviding voice to GLBT workers. Providing such voice will require committed \nleadership. Howard Becker (1963) introduced the concept of \u201cmoral entrepreneurs\u201d \n(p. 147) to denote individuals whose ideas stick and who can promote certain norms \nin organizational settings. There is a need to identify and foster moral entrepreneurs \nwho can champion and promote the significance of democratic and fair use of \nvoice at work and who can alter the normative topography of organizations by doing \nso. Through the example that moral entrepreneurs will set, the message of  \ndemocratic and fair mechanisms of voice can be legitimized and routinized in \npractices, processes, and systems of work. Human resource managers can play a \nsignificant role in identifying and fostering moral entrepreneurship to promote voice \nfor GLBT employees and other invisible minority groups. \nReferences \n \nBarron, L.
