This is unusual because\nunder these market circumstances there appear to be few incentives to achieve mutually beneficial\noutcomes despite their strategic policy importance. This paper argues that an understanding of the\nmonopolistic environment using a Transaction Cost Economics theoretical framework and\nRelationship Marketing concepts provides an approach to solving this problem as well as testing\naspects of these disciplines empirically in a novel area. This plan is supported by the results from a\nPilot Study and the paper concludes by proposing a substantial research project to test this hypothesis\nin the UK Defence Procurement situation.\nKeywords: Relationship Marketing, Transaction Cost Economics, Monopoly, Defence Procurement\n(5703 words)\nIntroduction\nThis paper addresses an under-researched area of business-to-business relationships, namely the\nrelationship which exists where one or both parties has a monopoly of supply or demand (Fishwick,\n1993). Many theories of buyer-seller relationships have discussed in general terms the concept of\nstructural bonds and opportunism, but not adequately applied them to the extreme situation of\nmonopoly buyer and monopoly seller relationships. We first summarise the difficulties faced by the\nUK Ministry of Defence (MoD) and its major industrial suppliers in moving away from traditional,\nadversarial relationships whilst facing increasingly monopolistic business dealings. We then justify the\nuse of a Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) model as a theoretical lens through which to view the\nproblem. Because Relationship Marketing (RM) provides an effective framework for describing\nbusiness-to-business relationships, this paper argues that its concepts can be used to address the\nproblems identified when viewed through the TCE theoretical lens and at the same time enabling a\nbetter understanding of the dynamics of sustained monopolistic business relationships. The authors\nfinally propose an exploratory research programme within the UK Defence Procurement (DP)\nenvironment to test the approach.\nUK DP\nHistorically, the relationship between the UK MoD and the UK Defence Industries has been\nadversarial. On one hand, with equipment expenditure of \u00a310,082 million in 2000\/01 (DASA, 2000),\nthe UK MoD has immense power as British industry\u2019s largest single customer. It can thus determine\nthe \u2018size, structure, conduct, ownership and performance of the industry through pricing, profitability,\n2technical progress and exports\u2019 (Hartley 1998). On the other hand, industry is a major exporter and\ncontributor to the UK\u2019s balance of payments, its production for foreign sales reduces UK MoD\u2019s\nequipment unit costs, it develops strategically important technologies such as aero engines and is a\nsignificant employer in UK industrial areas. Lastly, the major UK Defence companies are virtual\ndomestic monopolies and can team with foreign companies to further reduce the choice of supplier.\nThe UK MoD\/industrial supplier relationship is thus dominated by a monopoly market in which each\nside wields considerable power but where lack of trust and the option to leave often reduces\nefficiency, increases costs and offers little incentive to co-operate (Humphries & Wilding, 2001,\nPalmer, 2001, Parker & Hartley 1997). Against this background, in the 1999 UK Defence White Paper\n(Cm 4446, 1999) the Government stated that its Smart Acquisition initiative depended heavily on the\nconcept of partnership in order to reap the benefits of competition and collaboration. It is this\nchallenging and potentially mutually exclusive business objective that drives a need for research in\nthis area.\nThe Monopoly Environment\nIn our search of the literature for a suitable model with which to examine the relationship conditions\nwithin a monopoly, we first considered 2 relationship power perspectives. Michael Porter\u2019s (1980) five\nforces model of competitive advantage considers business relationships are characterised by a short-\nterm orientation, arms-length competition and the exercise of market power (Rugman & D\u2019Cruz, 2000).\nHowever, although participants may aim to achieve market dominance by limiting competition through\nthe creation of barriers to entry, this does not accurately represent UK DP monopolies where equally\npowerful \u2018partners\u2019 can be locked in a \u2018deadly embrace\u2019 from which neither can escape. An\nalternative view is provided by Andrew Cox et al (2000) who see the combination of resource utility\nand scarcity creating a power regime in which the involved parties will employ adversarial\/non-\nadversarial and arms-length\/collaborative arrangements depending on their relative power positions.\nThese options are shown in the matrix at Figure 1.\nTAKE IN FIGURE 1\nQuadrant 1 suggests limited information, resource sharing and the buyer\/supplier aiming to obtain a\ngreater share of the exchange value. In quadrant 2 a long-term, balanced relationship is sought\nwhere there is little sharing of specific assets but both parties gain some strategic benefit. In quadrant\n3, the parties work closely together and share sensitive information and costly resources. However,\n3the dominant partner intends to take a disproportionate share of the returns. In quadrant 4, both sides\nenjoy a close, collaborative, equal arrangement, often called a \u2018partnership\u2019. Although this approach\noffers a perspective on the appropriate use of power within a business relationship, it was optimised\nfor use in \u2018normal\u2019 markets. In UK DP, where neither party has choice over the selection of\nrelationship strategy and where equality of power really means equally disempowered, the\nRelationship Power Analysis matrix in Figure 1 fails to provide a robust framework for extending\nthinking on long-term, monopoly relationships.\nIn a review of the contracting and TCE literatures, we noted that when the cost of managing the risk\nassociated with human factors such as opportunism became too high, the market could break down\nand force a firm to internalise the business, in effect creating an internal monopoly (Faulkner & de\nRond, 2000). However, TCE treats the monopoly phenomenon as a short-term, highly undesirable\nmarket aberration which would normally be dealt with by government anti-trust regulation (Williamson,\n1996). We have nevertheless adapted Oliver Williamson\u2019s (1975) Economic Organisations Failure\nFramework in Figure 2 to show the influences that create and sustain a monopolistic relationship and\nborne in mind that for the majority of major contracts in UK DP, monopoly is considered to be in the\npublic interest (Fishwick, 1993).\nTAKE IN FIGURE 2\nHowever, although both sides need to rely on maintaining close relationships over the supply of highly\nspecialised goods (Grant, 1995), inevitably they are open to opportunistic behaviour (self-interest\nseeking with guile (Williamson, 1975)). This is especially the case since Sir Peter, now Lord Levene\nended MoD\u2019s \u2018cosy relationship\u2019 with industry in 1985 (Hartley, 1998) which introduced uncertainty and\ncomplexity into the market. In seeking to obtain public expenditure value for money the UK MoD\nattempts to drive down industry\u2019s profit to a \u2018reasonable\u2019 level and in turn the contractor attempts to\ninflate the view of his costs to ensure the best possible rate of return. This deliberate obfuscation is\ninformation impactedness (selective information disclosures, and distortions which are difficult or\nexpensive to verify at the time and which undermine the durability of contract arrangements) (Liston-\nHeyes, 1995). The consequences are that industry loses its incentive to perform better and, the UK\nMoD reduces the resources available to industry that might have been used to fund important\nResearch and Development. This is bounded rationality where people have only so much capacity to\nrationalise what is going on around them and therefore naturally limit their performance to the\n4adequate rather than the optimum (Simon, 1957). The sum effect is the creation of an adversarial\nrelationship without the freedom to look to the market for alternatives (Parker & Hartley, 1997) and the\nformation of small numbers\/monopoly situation. Although the authors can find no empirical research\nusing Williamson's (1975) Framework in similar circumstances, it seems to have face validity because\nthe factors it represents are readily observable in the UK DP situation (Humphries & Wilding, 2000).\nWe have therefore decided to use it as the basis of our theoretical framework with which to investigate\nthis unusual situation. We now turn to a critical review of RM with the intention of determining the\nextent to which its business-to-business relational concepts can provide a means of understanding the\ndynamics within sustained monopolistic conditions and especially those found between the UK\nMinistry of Defence and its industrial suppliers.\nThe Importance of Relationships in Marketing\nAn RM view of marketing is that it aims to establish, develop and maintain successful relational\nexchanges which involves designing and negotiating strategic partnerships with vendors and\ntechnology partners through which the firm deploys its distinctive competencies to serve market\nopportunities (Webster, 1992). The RM literature also provides comprehensive views of the various\nstyles used by firms and individuals when they do business with each other. These perspectives do\nnot just draw on Marketing for inspiration but also on Behavioural Psychology (Simon, 1957),\nSociology (Naude & Buttle, 2000), and Organisation (Hatch, 1997). Such approaches might seem to\nbe simplistic but at the fundamental level social relations shape and define the nature of synergistic\ninteractions between firms (Madhok, 2000) and may provide a starting point from which to understand\nan essentially uncharted area. This section of the paper therefore uses RM concepts to explore the\nbusiness drivers, the development of various theories, the key variables and their relevance to\nmonopolistic business-to-business relationships.\nDrivers for Closer Business Relationships\nIn the last 20 years competitive pressures have forced companies to become more reactive to\nsatisfying rapidly changing, specific customer needs in global markets and prompted a search for\nreduced transaction costs and more efficient, agile processes (Christopher, 1997). Firstly, quality\nsystems, such as Total Quality Management, have encouraged \u2018reverse marketing\u2019 starting with the\ncustomer (demand driven\/flexible manufacturing) and moving back to procurement process\nefficiencies (reduced cycle times and inventory) (Lewin & Johnston, 1997). Secondly, Supply Chain\n5optimisation has stimulated the use of IS tools and networks and highlighted the importance of\nrelationships involving fewer, key suppliers to build competitive advantage (Wilson, 1995). This\ncompetitive advantage includes access to new technologies, information, skills and markets,\nincreased capabilities to provide a wider range of products and services and, improved management\nthat realises the importance of customer satisfaction, customer retention and relationships to the firm\u2019s\nperformance (Mohr & Spekman, 1994). More recently Supply Chain Management describes a\nbusiness environment in which firms closely co-operate rather than compete to achieve mutual goals\n(Perks & Easton, 2000). In summary, when allied to a concentrating and globalising trend of business,\nthese factors have produced a dramatic shift from domestic, transactional sourcing to a New\nProcurement Paradigm based upon global, relational sourcing (Sheth & Sharma, 1997).\nThe MoD and its industrial partners have felt the same winds of change. The ending of the Cold War\nin 1989 removed the concept of \u2018Defence at any cost\u2019 and instead the MoD has been driven\nrelentlessly by operational, financial and political pressures to become smaller, flatter and more\nflexible by using out-sourcing, rationalisation, redundancies and stock reduction programmes (Cm\n4446, 1999). More recently the Smart Acquisition Initiative (Hansard, 2000) introduced more\nstreamlined processes under the banner: faster, cheaper, better and stated that partnering would\nallow it to overcome the adversarial relationships within a Defence market containing few competitors\n(MoD\/CBI 1988). However, despite clear strategic intentions, practical implementation of partnering\narrangements by the MoD has been slow, patchy and clouded by uncertainty over ways and means\n(Humphries & Wilding, 2001).\nRelationship Marketing Theory Development\nEarly emphasis was on discrete transactions, planning, control and profit maximisation and the\nprimary focus of the exchange relationship was precluding killing and stealing (Dwyer et al, 1987).\nKnown as Sales Management, this thrived in large organisations in the 1970s and 80s and usually\noperated in an adversarial mode (McDonald et al, 1997). As organisations migrated from bureaucratic\nhierarchies to more flexible and decentralised structures and buyer-seller relationships become less\nadversarial, the role of marketing within the firm changed. The Japanese Keiretsu suggested\navoidance of confrontation as a solution to disputes (Gundlach & Murphy, 1993) and required discrete\nmarket transactions to be displaced by closer, long-term relationships. Furthermore, the concept of\nvalue creation through collaboration rather than exchange depended on purposeful co-operation using\n6a web of operational and interpersonal connections and structures (Dyer & Chu, 2000) and could\nextend to groups of co-operating, similar product\/service companies known as sourced, service\nconsortia (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2000). Partnership has many definitions but is generally a\npurposive, strategic relationship between independent firms sharing compatible goals and striving for\nmutual benefit (Palmer, 2001). Linkage takes place in form and substance that goes beyond the\nconventional flow of products and paper (Mohr & Spekman, 1994). Firms are also likely to be\ninvolved in more than one type of relationship at any time and will classify suppliers\/customers\naccording to their importance and business complexity and adopt a portfolio approach to create and\nmanage relationships appropriately (Olsen & Ellram, 1997).\nNext, the idea of Industrial Networks saw pairs of firms in dyadic relationships forming focal, value-\nadded partnerships and, together with a secondary network of other firms, managing the flow of goods\nand services around a specific market opportunity (Anderson et al, 1994). Hakan Hakansson\u2019s\nEuropean Industrial Marketing Group (IMP) sought richer meaning in these relationships where the\ndegree of closeness between network interactiond was termed \u2018embeddedness\u2019 (Metcalf et al, 1992).\nRelationships were seen as valuable resources and investments capable of increasing economic and\ntechnological efficiency and serving as information channels and means of reducing uncertainty.\nAnother perspective was the Marriage Analogy that saw building and sustaining customer\nrelationships (McDonald et al, 1997) as requiring similar relationship qualities to those in marriage. As\na result of dealing closely with a partner a firm achieved reduced uncertainty, managed dependence,\nexchange efficiency and social satisfaction (Dwyer et al, 1987, Tuten & Urben, 2001). Additionally, the\narrangement required bilateral investment, a long-term perspective and the avoidance of legal\nremedies to secure co-operation (Gundlach & Murphy, 1993, Gummesson, 1999). Finally, the New\nMarketing Paradigm emphasised the strategic importance of relationship building and maintenance by\nthe appointment of senior managers to devote high level expertise and management to this key task\nas Key Account Managers (MacDonald et al, 1997).\nWithin monopolistic UK DP relationships transactional business has been the norm but given the drive\nto seek synergistic benefits, efforts have been made to forge improved relationships between the main\nprotagonists of a dyadic nature. But, the lack of network dynamics has reduced the effectiveness of\nattempts to discover \u2018common ground\u2019 on which to establish \u2018embeddedness\u2019 and few incentives to\n7dispel adversarial practices have excluded the Keiretsu option. The Marriage Analogy, on the other\nhand, has been dismissed as imprecise and misleading in the context of many markets characterised\nby firms having multiple simultaneous relationships. However, in the case of UK DP a much stronger\ncase seems possible for its relevance although a key limitation is the impossibility of \u2018divorce\u2019. Finally,\nthe MoD has appointed senior people to take responsibility for managing specific relationships or key\naccounts.\nRelationship Variables\nWe next address the key variables used within RM theories in order to identify the important relational\nfeatures that build and sustain successful business-to-business relationships. A summary of these\ntogether with the authors who proposed them as issues is in Figure 3.\nTAKE IN FIGURE 3\nTrust and Commitment\nOur treatment of trust and commitment is combined because these variables are highly intertwined in\na rich seam of business, organisational and behavioural interactions. Moreover, many writers have\nremarked on this complexity and highlighted their importance to the stability and productiveness of\nbusiness-to-business relationships (Faulkner & de Rond, 2000, Frow, 2001, Morgan and Hunt, 1994,\nSheth & Sharma, 1997).\nTrust is a complex entity, which is not easy to measure (Gulati, 1995). It has an extensive literature\nand for the sake of maintaining a clear focus on the business-to-business relationship area, this review\ntakes a simplified perspective. Trust enables co-operative behaviour, promotes improved\nrelationships, reduces harmful conflict and allows effective response in a crisis (Doney & Cannon,\n1997). Trust requires risk (a perceived probability of loss) (Cowles, 1997), uncertainty (over the\nintentions of the other party) (Doney & Cannon, 1997), interdependence (where the interests of one\nparty cannot be achieved without reliance on the other) (Kumar, 1996) and choice (alternative options\nare available) as essential conditions. Both Economics and Games Theory see trust as a stable\nphenomenon that either exists or doesn\u2019t (Williamson, 1996, Axelrod, 1984). Others see it as being\n\u2018caused\u2019 (e.g. by previous good experience, institutional reputation, commitment) and affecting factors\nsuch as openness, reliability and honesty (Goleman, 1998). A further assessment is a combination of\nall these elements in a complex interaction between parties which sometimes requires a leap in faith\n8to achieve but results in the creation of a reservoir of goodwill and the incentive to go the extra mile\n(Kumar, 1996). Therefore, in an era of more flexible organisation forms, there is a shift from\ninstitutional to relational trust (Rousseau et al, 1998) which links to the development of RM itself.\nTrust is of crucial importance in industrial and marketing contexts (Cowles, 1997) and manifested\nwhen a party has fundamental belief\/confidence that the other partner will act reliably and with integrity\nin the best interests of the other (Kramer, 1999). There is little doubt that repeated cycles of exchange,\nrisk-taking and successful fulfillment of expectations strengthens the willingness of parties to rely upon\neach other and, as a result expand the relationship \u2013 in effect producing a virtuous circle that can be\ndeveloped and promoted (Goleman, 1998).\nCommitment is viewed as an outcome of trust because without it, the relationship lacks credibility and\ngrowth potential (Naude & Buttle, 2000). Commitment is defined variously in the literature as the\nbelief by an exchange partner that the relationship with another is so important as to warrant\nmaximum effort to maintain it indefinitely (Morgan & Hunt, 1994). The desire to expend considerable\nadditional effort in building the relationship is a recurring theme as is an implicit or explicit pledge or\nenduring desire to maintain a valued relationship (Moorman et al, 1992, Wilson, 1995). At the\ninteractive level there can be an implication of stability, loyalty and sacrifice in both interorganisational\nand interpersonal dealings.\nIt is difficult to understand how trust and commitment might thrive in the monopoly environment\nenvisaged by Williamson (1975). We have speculatively modified Morgan and Hunts (1994)\nCommitment-Trust Theory in Figure 4 to illustrate the problems.\nTAKE IN FIGURE 4\nInformation Impactedness and Bounded Rationality have been added as negative influences. The\nmodel defines Reduced Propensity to Leave as a significant outcome. However, in a UK DP\nmonopoly neither side is free to quit and this would instead provide a further negative input to\nRelationship Commitment and exclude the beneficial influence of Relationship Termination Costs.\nThe addition of these factors might make the attainment of the model\u2019s positive outcomes rather more\ndifficult to achieve. Nevertheless, a number of successful relationships are visible within UK DP\nmonopolies so it must be possible to promote co-operative behaviours that break out of the\nOrganisations Failure Framework\u2019s downward spiral and enter Goleman\u2019s (1998) virtuous circle where\n9integrity breeds credibility which in turn breeds further integrity. Writers are clear that both trust and\ncommitment require an enormously challenging learning curve to deliver effectively but, the benefits\nare better customer service, superior communication and increased joint profitability (Dyer & Chu,\n2000). In summary, although trust and commitment are strong, supportive factors that are\ncommunicated explicitly by action and without which a sound relational exchange will fail to deliver full\nbenefits, quite how they affect the dynamics of monopolistic, UK DP relationships is unknown.\nCo-operation, Co-ordination and Collaboration (C3Behaviour)\nThese closely related variables are termed \u2018C3 Behaviour\u2019 in this paper. Co-operative, co-ordinating\nand collaborative behaviour is defined as working together\/jointly to bring resources into a required\nrelationship to achieve effective operations in harmony with the strategies\/objectives of the parties\ninvolved, thus resulting in mutual benefit (Axelrod, 1984, Humphries & Wilding, 2001, Oliver, 1990,\nStern & Reve, 1980). These views describe the boundary markers within which productive\nrelationships can take place (Mohr & Spekman, 1994). C3 Behaviour actions are similar or\ncomplementary, co-ordinated actions needed to achieve mutual outcomes with reciprocation over time\n(McDonald et al, 1997). At a higher level, C3 Behaviour rather than pure exchange is used to create\nreal value; an organisational competence known as \u2018collaborative advantage\u2019 which requires\ndeveloped mechanisms, structures, skills and processes (Moss Kanter, 1994, Rugman & D\u2019Cruz,\n2000). A more product-oriented approach requires collaboration or coalescing between buyers and\nsellers to produce quality products and reduce costs (Metcalf et al, 1992). It appears that C3\nBehaviour is a complete antithesis of those potentially found in monopolistic relationships where\nconcentration on safeguarding against opportunism endangers the level and quality of co-operation\nand adversely affects the level of value attained through collaboration (Madhok, 2000). And yet in a\ngrowing climate of reducing UK Defence spending and market concentration, perhaps the driving\nmotivation to use C3 Behaviour might be survival rather than a simple desire to leverage mutual\ncapabilities.\nLong-term Orientation\nA long-term orientation is an essential prerequisite for moving away from adversarial relationship. It\nsuggests continuity, stability, predictability and working together consistently to achieve sustained\ncompetitive advantage and an opportunity to build trust and commitment (Oliver, 1990). This attitude\nis also instrumental in increased morale, co-operation and improved dispute settlement procedures\n10\n(Lewin & Johnston, 1997). Unfortunately the Defence Procurement business has always be\ncharacterised by short-termism due to the limited Parliamentary spending horizons that are often\ncharacterised by \u2018stop-go\u2019 policies and this uncertainty introduces a strong source of bounded\nrationality and limited vision. The result is incongruity and tension where short-term behaviour is\npromoted within an inescapable, long-term relationship and it would be interesting to probe this\nphenomenon to discover if it is possible to reconcile the two.\nInterdependence, Power and Conflict\nA relationship will not survive unless both sides are dependent upon each other to achieve their\nobjectives and loss in individual autonomy is compensated through the expected gains (Mohr &\nSpekman, 1994, Rugman & D\u2019Cruz, 2000). A key outcome of interdependence is reduced temptation\nto act opportunistically and thus to prolong the relationship (Lewin & Johnston, 1997).\nInterdependence is built and reinforced by both parties investing in the relationship. Such investments\nare likely to be non-retrievable such as funds, equipment, IS, tacit knowledge, skills and management\ntime (Sheth & Sharma, 1997). Power-play also determines whether an interdependent relationship\nwill survive. Power is a complex variable with both beneficial and destructive properties, even when\nnot exercised overtly. Unbalance, or asymmetry, can make one partner susceptible to the power and\ninfluence of the other (Hatch, 1997) and, as already mentioned at the beginning of this paper, can be\nthe basis of a deliberate business strategy (Cox et al, 2000). However, this need not be destabilising\nas long as the perception of equity (a relationship between equals (Watson, 1999)) remains in terms of\nsharing the outcomes and participation in the venture. Destructive conflict (opponent-centred\nbehaviour (Stern & Reve, 1980)) should not be confused with functional conflict (creative abrasion\n(Eisenhardt et al, 1997)). The latter\u2019s freedom to disagree takes place in an atmosphere of trust and\nnot only enables the productive resolution of disagreements but also produces innovation from\nteamwork (Hatch, 1997). The table at Figure 5 shows a comparison of the destructive aspects of\npower, monopoly and trust. Neither power nor trust quite accurately sums-up the monopoly situation\nwhere you will find that mutual imprisonment without an exit option or means of complaint\n(Gummesson, 1999) limits freedom of action and mutually disempowers. For example, contracts will\nnecessarily be long term but they may not be open or informal and more often than not infested with\nopportunism and adversarialism. Additionally there will be no opportunity to choose partners with\n11\n\u2018appropriate values\u2019 and a negotiating strategy is likely to be both constrained and empowered by\nhaving only one partner.\nTAKE IN FIGURE 5\nAdaption and Communication\nA different type of investment is that which adapts to the needs of the relationship. Examples are\nproducts, procedures, inventory management, attitudes, values and goals and these mark a\ncommitment to maintain the relationship. The extent to which adaptions are made will depend on the\ntype and complexity of the product\/service, the depth of information exchanged and the extent of\norganisational social and operational contacts and degree of co-operation required (Metcalf et al,\n1992). Multi-level, intensive communications are essential in successful relationships (Moss Kanter,\n1994). They flow through honest, open channels from joint planning and goal setting where mutual\nexpectations are established and measured and allow the breadth and depth of the complex\ninteraction to be managed (Gaski, 1984). At the operational level, clear guidelines on the sharing of\nproprietary information and technology influence product development, costs, sales and revenues and\nincrease commitment (Wilson, 1995). Such is the degree of technical and design complexity within\nUK DP that adaption and communication must be viewed as key relational success factors. However,\nthe issue of intellectual property rights (IPR) is often the factor that defines the monopoly and is a root\ncause of disagreement and discontent. Moreover, adaption and communication may be exercised\nunder mutual duress rather than within a spirit of willing, openness.\nBuilding Relationship Management\nIn the last few sections a number of key relationship variables have been reviewed. Leading from\nthem, the table in Figure 6 summarises a number of practical, normative management measures that\ncan be taken to build and sustain a business partnership but which also appear relevant to the UK DP\nsituation with its more challenging problems.\nTAKE IN FIGURE 6\nA management philosophy or corporate culture needs to be developed where companies can operate\nin a climate of trust and openness (Mohr & Spekman, 1994). Perhaps this can be accomplished by\nchanging the reward systems which reinforce the behaviours that generate trust, mutual goals and\nadaption (Wilson, 1995) but, the difficulty of changing the mindsets of staff should not be\nunderestimated (Sheth & Sharma, 1997). The importance of rich interpersonal relationships to the\n12\ngrowth of trust is often mentioned, but there is an alternative pragmatic view where close personal\nrelationships are not essential and where enlightened self-interest operates such that both press hard\nfor advantage but stay within their trust compact (Kumar, 1996). In the final analysis, business\nrelationships depend on clearly understanding each other\u2019s needs and the maintenance of an agreed\nframework within which to prosecute shared objectives. It is possible that in a monopoly this\nframework can never be more than an uneasy truce.\nA Theoretical Framework for Research\nThe development of Relationship Marketing thinking appears to have mirrored that of the UK MoD and\nits industrial suppliers such that both see the need for strategic interaction at a relational rather than a\ntransactional level (CM 4446, 1999). Moreover, they understand they must put aside their traditional\napproach based upon the power game (Kumar, 1996) and embrace partnering principles base upon\ntrust (Watson, 1999). However, implementing these concepts appears to be extremely difficult,\npotentially because of the monopolistic aspects of their situation. The RM literature describes a\ncomplex suite of relationship variables that might provides some clear insights to the improvement of\nmonopolistic relationships within UK DP as long as one is wary of those aspects based upon\nassumptions of free market choice. These are illustrated in Figure 7 where we have juxtaposed a\nselection of business relationship 'antidotes' to the essentially negative factors in Williamson\u2019s (1975)\nEconomic Organisations Failure Framework.\nTAKE IN FIGURE 7\nBounded Rationality might be reversed by enabling mutual creativity through open contracts, joint\ninnovation, applying stretch targets, ensuring disputes are resolved quickly and fairly and by taking a\nlong-term view of the relationship (Ganesan, 1994). Uncertainty\/Complexity could be overcome by\nbuilding relationship stability and creating a framework for successful business. This could include\nworking more closely with fewer partners (Lewin & Johnston, 1997), pursuing mutual objectives\nthrough value creation, joint investment and harmonised processes and, building interdependence\nthrough C3 Behaviour (Moss Kanter, 1994). Creating a communication environment optimised for\nsuccess might defeat information Impactedness (Sheth & Sharma, 1997). This could involve\nimplementing multiple communication links at all level between firms (Mohr & Spekman, 1994, Morgan\n& Hunt, 1994) including KAM, IS, sharing business and design data, objective performance\nmeasurement and responding quickly the other party\u2019s needs (MacDonald et al, 1997). Opportunism\n13\nrequires measures to strengthen the relationship by creating a reliable business infrastructure; a focus\non the quality of the relationship outputs is key as is clarity over the boundaries of the relationship. A\ncreative approach to conflict and problem solving (Hatch, 1997), building goodwill, trust and\ncommitment by incrementally building on achievements could create the necessary ingredients of a\nvirtuous circle (Goleman, 1998). Lastly, Small Numbers might be addressed by incentivising a quality\nrelationship with highly rewarding, shared gains (Watson, 1999) and, both sides feel empowered to\nstrive dynamically for the mutual good and true equity to overcome power imbalance (Eisenhardt al,\n1997).\nWe pose the following Research Question: To determine if it is possible to obtain an understanding of\nthe monopolistic relationships within UK DP using the theoretical lens of Williamson\u2019s (1975)\nOrganisations Failure Framework combined with RM\u2019s relational and behavioural factors.\nOperationalising the Model\nA triangulated data capture approach was designed using both quantitative (questionnaire) and\nqualitative (semi-structured interview) methods, which aimed to measure perceptions from both\nrelationship sides. Operationalisation of the research instrument concentrated on the 5 dimensions of\nthe theoretical model in Figure 7 using a 5 point Likert scale (Youngman, 1984) with questions\ngrounded in the literature. The dimensions and 37 questions which achieved a satisfactory 0.7977\nlevel of Coefficient Alpha in the study (Bowman & Ambrosini, 1997) are shown in Appendix 1. The\nsemi-structured interview design involved following-up the dominant quantitative results by capturing\n\u2018why\u2019 information from senior relationship managers for each dimension of the relationship in question\ni.e. what were the key factors that resulted in success or failure? By this additional means it was\nintended to obtain the richness of perceptions needed to gain insight into the subtleties and cultural\ndepth of the business problem.\nThe Pilot Project\nIn order to test the research approach, a pilot project was carried out which examined both Industry\nand MoD perspectives of a current, UK DP relationship. This was a true monopoly worth \u00a340m per\nyear for the purchase of aircraft spare parts and the provision of repair services. Questionnaires were\nadministered to both team leaders and their staffs and a 100% response was received from the 50\nrespondents. The survey was followed-up by 30 minute semi-structured interviews with the 2 team\n14\nleaders. The joint statistical results are summarised in Figure 8 and, together with the semis-\nstructured interview key points must be treated with some circumspection because of the small\nsample of respondents.\nTAKE IN FIGURE 8\nNevertheless, they enable the following observations to be made:\n\uf0b7 The Model: Although the overall relationship satisfaction score of 47% bears out the\npredominantly negative prediction of Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure Framework, those\nof the 5 dimensions are neither uniformly optimistic nor pessimistic. The use of the theoretical\nmodel thus allows a pattern of results to be discerned for a particular business relationship.\n\uf0b7 Bounded Rationality \u2013 Creativity 53%: There was some evidence of a desire to improve service\nquality but low performance expectations were caused by a lack of joint activities to improve\nplanning and problem-solving.\n\uf0b7 Uncertainty\/Complexity \u2013 Stability 28%: This result highlights an unwillingness to take a long-term\nview of the relationship by investing in relationship-building (adaptive) measures such as\nimproved commercial and business processes.\n\uf0b7 Information Impactedness \u2013 Communication 58%: Despite the rating, both team leaders\nmentioned the poor quality of shared data and their fear that the other party would use honest\nperformance figures as a weapon against them. Nevertheless despite this lack of trust, actions to\nimprove matters such as staff exchanges, were being taken which indicated a desire to seek\nbetter adaption.\n\uf0b7 Opportunism \u2013 Reliability 34%: This result highlights a mutual lack of confidence and trust in\nthe ability of the other to deliver the contract outputs. The view appeared to be based upon poor\nC3 and opportunistic behaviours over pricing and service delivery moreover, it was mentioned\nthat tensions in the relationship were destructive rather than constructive.\n\uf0b7 Small Numbers - Quality 57%: Overall, the parties expressed feelings of helplessness at their\ninability to find ways to improve the relationship and achieve an equitable arrangement although\none remarked that the other\u2019s acknowledgement of poor performance in the survey was at least a\nstart.\n15\n\uf0b7 RM: The Pilot Study considered a monopoly where there was patently a poor relationship and as\npredicted by the model, negative behaviours were observed for which RM enabled a useful\nunderstanding. However, a larger sample is required to establish a clear view of the dynamics.\n\uf0b7 Business Perspective: The team leaders mentioned that the detailed charts which provided a\ncomparison of the parties\u2019 views question by question had, for the first time, given them a clear\nperspective of the relationship and would allow them to start detailed discussions on improvement\nmeasures.\nConclusion\nWithin the business environment and the RM literature in particular, much study has identified the key\nrelational dynamics and success factors. However, in the area of sustained, full monopolies there is\nlittle theory supported by empirically derived evidence. The authors have identified a substantial\nenterprise which annually spends over \u00a310bn per year and where very powerful actors, the UK MoD\nand Defence Industries, are locked into relationships which potentially disempower their efforts to\nobtain adequate value for money for tax-payers and profits for shareholders. This paper considered\nthe face value of Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure Framework providing a realistic lens\nthrough which to view UK DP monopolistic business-to-business relationships and the suitability of RM\nas an \u2018idiom\u2019 capable of describing them. The results of a Pilot Project have confirmed the validity\nand feasibility of this exploratory research approach and the authors now intend to extend their project\nto a further 53 monopolistic relationships. This will allow Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure\nFramework and RM theories to be tested empirically in a business environment which has received\nscant attention by Management Researchers. There will also be immense practical benefits if it is\npossible to help UK DP managers to improve the performance of their business.\n16\nAppendix 1 \u2013 Questionnaire Dimensions and Questions\n1.
