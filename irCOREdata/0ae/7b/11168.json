EISCAT\/ESR radar data and in situ FAST and PO-\nLAR satellite observations are coordinately analyzed to in-\nvestigate positive ionospheric storm effects in the dayside up-\nper F-region in both the polar cap and the auroral oval during\nthe magnetic storm of 15 May 1997. An ionization enhance-\nment, lasting for about 2.5 h, appeared first over the EIS-\nCAT site around magnetic noon; about one hour later, a sim-\nilar ionization enhancement was also seen over ESR. During\nthe concerned time period ion energy spectra measured on\nboard FAST show clearly continuous energy-latitude disper-\nsion when the satellite passed by over the EISCAT latitude.\nThis implies that EISCAT was located under the polar cusp\nregion which was highly active, and expanded greatly equa-\ntorwards due to magnetopause reconnections during long-\nlasting southward IMF. Simultaneously, soft particles of the\nmagnetosheath precipitated into the F-region ionosphere and\ncaused the positive storm effects over EISCAT. The coinci-\ndent increase in electron temperature at EISCAT gives ad-\nditional evidence for soft particle precipitation. Consistently,\nPOLAR UV images show strong dayside aurora extending to\nas low as 62\u25e6 N magnetic latitude. The ionization enhance-\nment over ESR, however, seems not to be caused by local\nparticle precipitation, evidenced by a lack of enhanced elec-\ntron temperature. The observed plasma convection velocity\nand data-fitted convection patterns by AMIE suggested that it\nis likely to be a polar patch originating from the cusp region\nand traveling to the ESR site.\nKey words. Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; particle percip-\nitation). Magnetospheric physics (storms and substorms)\n1 Introduction\nIonization enhancements in the ionospheric F-region re-\nsponding to magnetic storms are usually called positive iono-\nspheric storms. Morphology and physical mechanisms of\nCorrespondence to: S. Y. Ma (syma@whu.edu.cn)\npositive ionospheric storms at mid- and low-latitudes have\nbeen investigated extensively in recent decades (e.g. Rish-\nbeth et al., 1987; Fuller-Rowell et al., 1990, 1994; Danilov\n& Berlik, 1992; Pro\u00a8lss, 1995; Mikhailov et al., 1995; Nam-\ngaladze et al., 2000; and references therein). The physics for\nthis phenomenon involves F-region uplifting towards lower\nrecombination loss regions by an enhanced equatorward neu-\ntral wind excited in the heated auroral region, the thermo-\nspheric composition changes of O\/N2, and the electric field\ncaused by the disturbance dynamo effect, etc. In contrast,\npositive storm effects in the polar F-region are often associ-\nated with an impact of soft particles precipitating from mag-\nnetospheric source regions. For the magnetic noon sector\nof the auroral oval, the particles precipitate from four dis-\ntinct regions: (i) the magnetosheath through active cusp, (ii)\nthe plasma-mantle through the region poleward of the cusp,\n(iii) the low-latitude boundary layer between the dawn and\nevening flanks through the so-called cleft, and (iv) the day-\nside boundary plasma sheet (Newell and Meng, 1988, 1989;\nNewell et al., 1991; Kennel, 1995; Lyons et al., 1999). Of\nthem, the relation of positive polar ionospheric storm and\nactive cusp is quite acute and has received the attention of\nscientists for a long time (e.g. Danilov et al., 1987; Danilov,\n2001).\nOn the other hand, it is evident that enhancements in\nthe electron density of the ionospheric F-region created by\ncusp\/cleft particle precipitation at the dayside entry to the\npolar-cap convection flow play an important role in the for-\nmation of polar-cap patches (e.g. Valladares et al., 1994;\nWalker et al., 1999; Smith, et al., 2000). Most of these ob-\nservations, however, are not related to magnetic storms. Dur-\ning the magnetic storm of 15 May 1997, both the EISCAT\nradar (geog. lat. 69.6\u25e6 N, long. 19.2\u25e6 E) and the EISCAT-\nSvalbard radar (ESR, geog. lat. 78.0\u25e6 N, long. 16.0\u25e6 E)\nwere in operation and caught the storm simultaneously dur-\ning its main phase at the dayside sector. In our previous paper\n(Liu et al., 2000), it was indicated that, according to calcu-\nlations by means of the T96\u201301 magnetic field model (Tsy-\n1378 S. Y.

The solar\nwind and IMF parameters were recorded on the WIND satellite on\n15 May 1997.\nganeko, 1996), ESR was in the dayside polar cap during the\nmain phase and the beginning of the recovery phase of the\n15 May 1997 storm, while EISCAT was in the dayside au-\nroral oval or on its poleward boundary, being in agreement\nwith the UV images taken from the ultraviolet imager (UVI)\non board the POLAR satellite. This provides a valuable op-\nportunity to investigate storm effects in the dayside auroral\noval and in the polar cap regions simultaneously. A com-\nparative study mainly on the negative storm effects observed\nby EISCAT and ESR radar during this storm has been made\nin our paper mentioned above. In this contribution, we will\nfocus our attention on a dayside F-region positive storm su-\nperposed on the long-lasting negative phase of this storm.\n2 Observation results\n2.1 Interplanetary conditions and geomagnetic indices\nFigure 1 shows solar wind and IMF data from the WIND\nspacecraft, together with the Dst and Kp indices for\n15 May 1997. WIND observed the passage of an interplan-\netary shock at 01:16 UT, followed by several hours of high\nsolar wind dynamic pressure. The IMF turned southward\nat 04:46 UT, indicating the arrival of the magnetic cloud at\nthe WIND location (Cane et al., 1998). The IMF Bz shows\ntwo minima, with the first of \u221224.3 nT at 05:56 UT and the\nsecond of \u221224.7 nT at 10:23 UT. The IMF Bz experienced\nreversals from south to north, then back to south between the\ntwo minima. WIND was located at Xse = 1.21 \u00d7 106 km\nat 12:00 UT and the X component of the solar wind velocity\nVx was \u2212440 km\/s, giving a travelling time of 43 min from\nthe position of the WIND spacecraft to the subsolar mag-\nnetopause. The Dst index rose slightly at 01:59 UT, indi-\ncating a storm sudden commencement (SSC) caused by the\ninterplanetary shock at 01:16 UT (Cane et al., 1998). Af-\nter being nearly constant for four hours, it decreased rapidly\nand reached a minimum of \u2212115 nT. Afterwards it recov-\nered gradually to the normal level. The maximum Kp value\nwas 7\u2212.\nFor the period around the maximum of the magnetic storm\nmain phase that is concerned in this paper, the IMF Bz re-\nmained less than\u221220 nT, i.e. being very intense and directed\nsouthward; while the IMF By underwent an excursion from\nabout \u221210 nT to 20 nT. The solar wind dynamic pressure\nstayed at a low level of about 2\u20134 nPa.\n2.2 Positive storm observed by EISCAT\nFigure 2a shows a 2-D image of F-region electron den-\nsity distribution versus UT and height at the EISCAT site\nduring 06:00\u201313:00 UT. It can be clearly seen that a sta-\nble layer of ionization enhancement which peaked at about\n350 km height appeared during 09:10\u201311:30 UT (\u223c11:05\u2013\n13:25 MLT, MLT\u2248UT+1.9 h) in the upper F-region. For\ncomparison, Fig. 2b gives a reference that is an average of\navailable observations on some quiet days with maximum of\nKp less than 3 during April to June of 1997. Figure 2c shows\nthe percentage deviation of the electron density on 15 May\nwith respect to the reference. Considering the possible day-\nto-day variations ofNe at about 20% or more, only the storm-\ntime deviations with magnitude larger than 20% are referred\nto as storm effects. Thus, it indicates that strong positive\nstorm effects took place above 340 km, lasting for about 2 h\nfrom 09:15\u201311:00 UT (\u223c11:10\u201312:55 MLT), superposed on\na negative effect background.

In comparison with the one observed at the\nEISCAT site, the peak height was about 40 km higher. Fig-\nure 3b gives a reference that is an average of the available\nobservations on some quiet days, with maximum of Kp less\nthan 3 during April to June of 1997. Figure 3c represents\nthe percentage deviation of electron density on 15 May with\nrespect to the reference. It shows that strong positive storm\neffects took place above 370 km, between 10:20\u201311:30 UT,\nsuperposed on a negative effect background. The deviation\nis peaked at 380 km and above 470 km with a magnitude of\nlarger than 50%. In comparison with the observations at the\nEISCAT site, the positive storm effects seem weaker, and ap-\npeared one hour later, lasting about one hour shorter. Be-\nsides, we can see from Fig. 3a that F-region ionization en-\nhancements also occurred around 09:10 UT and 09:50 UT.\nThey were superposed on a negative storm phase, showing\nno obvious increase in electron density in comparison with\nthe reference (see Fig. 3c). Simultaneous measurements of\nNe and Te during the time periods mentioned above indicated\n(shown later in Sect. III) that they were associated with local\nsoft particle precipitation.

We can see\nthat Ne and Te coincidently increased at 09:06 UT, jumping\nrapidly from 0.57\u00d71011 to 1.23\u00d71011 el.\/m3 forNe and from\n1890 K to 2600 K for Te, within 10 min. At about 11:30 UT,\nboth recovered to the original level. This implies that the\nconsidered upper F-region ionization enhancement at EIS-\nCAT is related to soft electron precipitation. According to\nsimulation results of Millward et al. (1999), the energies of\nthe precipitating electrons are probably centered at around a\nfew hundred eV, suggesting magnetosheath-like particles.\n3.1.2 Association with the active cusp\nTo confirm that EISCAT was indeed under the cusp region\nduring the concerned time period, particle measurements\nfrom the FAST satellite are examined. Between 09:41\u2013\n09:56 UT, FAST passed over the northern polar region and\nS. Y.

Ne and Te versus UT at 344 km height observed with the\nEISCAT radar.\ntook a snapshot of energetic particles at heights of 380\u2013\n1340 km over the auroral and the polar cap region. In par-\nticular, the Time-of-Flight Energy Angle Mass Spectrograph\nrecorded a characteristic ion energy-latitude dispersion of\ncusp precipitating particles (Shelley et al., 1976; Reiff et\nal., 1977; Lockwood and Smith, 1994) between 09:41:38\u2013\n09:43:40 UT, as shown in Fig. 5. The main ion composi-\ntion of the precipitation is H+, with energies dispersing from\nabout 10 keV to 30 eV (see top panel of Fig. 5); the ener-\ngies of precipitating electrons range from 50 eV to 1000 eV\n(not given here). Ions with higher energy are observed first at\nlower latitudes. With poleward convection of newly opened\nforce lines, ions with lower energy are then seen at higher\nlatitudes. Within this time interval FAST orbited at 401\u2013\n470 km, the geographic latitude of the force line foot-point\ntracing to FAST ranged from 68.3\u25e6 to 75.9\u25e6 N, and the local\ntime was between 13:35 and 14:20 LT. It is obvious that the\nsatellite trajectory covered the latitude of the EISCAT site at\nthe equatorward edge of the ion dispersion region. It is evi-\ndent, therefore, that EISCAT was continually under the cusp\nregion during the concerned interval, and the F-region pos-\nitive storm effects around magnetic noon can be attributed\nto clef\/cusp\/plasma-mantle precipitation due to continuous\nreconnection at the dayside magnetopause. An exact deter-\nmination of the specified particle precipitation region is not\neasy due to a lack of necessary particle data over the EISCAT\nsite.\n3.1.3 Evidence of strong dayside aurora near EISCAT by\nPOLAR UVI\nAn UV image of aurora observed on the POLAR satellite\nat 09:52 UT (see Fig. 6) gives another evidence that during\nthe considered time interval, EISCAT was probably located\nunder or adjacent to the cusp region, where strong dayside\naurora appeared. Thus, the sources of positive storm effects\nin the upper F-region are likely to be the cleft\/cusp\/plasma-\nmantle particle precipitation.\n3.2 Source of the positive storm at ESR\nFigure 7 shows the electron density and temperature ob-\nserved by the ESR radar during 08:30 UT to 15:00 UT at\n380 km height, where the maximum positive storm effect\nappeared. Since there is a data gap in Te at 380 km, be-\ntween 09:30\u201310:00 UT, the relevant variations of Ne and Te\nat the adjacent height of 416 km are also given in this fig-\nure. We can see that enhancements in electron density around\n09:10 UT and 09:50 UT are accompanied by a remarkable in-\ncrease in electron temperature, suggesting their association\nwith local soft particle precipitation. It has been shown in\nour previous paper (Liu et al., 2000) that these two electron\nenhancements are peak-to-peak correlated with a large pulse-\nlike increase in solar wind dynamic pressure by pressure-\ncontrolled soft particle precipitation. On the other hand, there\nis no remarkable increase in electron temperature accompa-\nnying the \u201cblob\u201d between 10:40 UT to 11:10 UT. This means\nthat local particle precipitation did not cause the concerned\n\u201cblob\u201d. Long-lasting large ion upflow (Liu et al., 2000) may\nalso be a possible evidence that the positive storm at ESR is\nprobably not attributed to local particle precipitation. These\nfacts lead us to transportation effects due to plasma convec-\ntion flow and thermospheric circulation for the positive F-\nregion storm at ESR.\nIt is shown in Fig. 8 that the northward plasma convection\nover EISCAT during 09:20\u201310:20 UT exhibits an average\nspeed of about 250 m\/s. The east-west flow velocity of the\nenhanced plasma cloud travelling out from the EISCAT site\naround the merging gap region is expected to undergo com-\nplex changes due to IMF By switching from dawnward to\nduskward. We checked the polar ionospheric convection pat-\nterns during 09:20\u201310:00 UT that were calculated by AMIE\n(Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics) of\nNCAR (Richmond, 1992). The patterns show that EISCAT\nwas near the merging gap on the dusk convection cell, while\nESR was within the polar cap on the same cell. Furthermore,\ntwo radar stations were located on the nearly equal or slightly\ndifferent potential lines (i.e. on nearly the same convection\nline), as shown in Fig. 9. The speed along the convection\nline was at a level of about 200\u2013600 m\/s by a rough estimate.\nTherefore, it is very likely that the high density plasma cloud\ncreated near EISCAT may travel toward and reach the ESR\nsite in 1 to 1.5 h, although an exact demonstration should be\nmade of tracing the plasma parcel trajectory. So, we suppose\nthat the upper ionospheric ionization enhancement observed\nby ESR is probably a travelling polar patch originated from\naround the cusp region and convected to the ESR site.\n4 Summary\nIn this paper, EISCAT\/ESR radar data and in situ FAST and\nPOLAR satellite observations have coordinately been ana-\nlyzed to investigate positive ionospheric storm effects in the\ndayside upper F-region in both the polar cap and the auroral\noval during the magnetic storm of 15 May 1997.

This implies that EISCAT was\nlocated under the polar cusp region and soft particles from\nthe magnetosheath precipitated into the F-region ionosphere,\nleading to the positive storm effects over EISCAT. The cusp\nregion was highly active and expanded greatly equatorwards\ndue to magnetopause reconnection during long-lasting south-\nward IMF. The coincident increase in electron temperature\ngives additional evidence for soft particle precipitations.\nOn the other hand, the ionization enhancement over\nESR seems not to be caused by local particle precipitation,\nsince no enhanced electron temperature was obviously ob-\nserved. The polar ionospheric convection patterns produced\nby means of AMIE, as well as plasma convection velocity\naround the merging gap region under IMF By conditions\nturning from dawnward (By < 0) to duskward (By > 0),\nsuggests that the positive storm phase seen at ESR was prob-\nably a polar patch that originated from the active cusp region\nand travelled to the ESR site.\nAcknowledgements.
