Traditional discounted cash-flow analysis alone does not\nvalue or focus managerial attention upon the strategic long-term benefits of CRM:\nlearning from customers, building customer advocacy and retention, and reduced market\nuncertainty. Through a simulated case study analysis, we illustrate how the addition of\nReal Options to discounted cash-flow can improve CRM investment decision making,\nencourage managers to verify critical assumptions and reduce both investment and\nbusiness risk.\nIntroduction\nThe financial framework most often used in preparing business cases for Customer\nRelationship Management (CRM) may, perversely, inhibit such programmes from\nachieving their strategic and business objectives. Arguably, the traditional cash-flow\nanalyses based upon Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Net Present Value (NPV)\ncalculations are too limited a basis on which to make CRM investment decisions. This is\nbecause they undervalue returns and focus management attention on short-term cash-flow\nwhen, perhaps, the main benefits of customer relationship investments lie in building a\nstrategic customer relationship asset. In other words, the long-term benefits of closer,\ndeeper relationships with selected customers are difficult to quantify in cash terms since\nthey can lead to reductions in the volatility of sales, market uncertainty and business risk.\n2Given that CRM investments are usually strategically significant, with a value in the\nrange of $60 million to $200 million for a highly complex installation which can take up\nto 3 years to install (Ebner et al, 20021), the risk of business failure needs to be fully\nquantified. In the 1990s, the climate for CRM investment was more favourable and firms\ninvested without fully considering these risks (Rigby et al, 20022). Their research\nsuggests that 55% of all CRM projects haven\u2019t produced results, and some 20% of users\nreport actual damage to long-standing customer relationships.\nToday, business leaders are demanding a more rigorous approach to developing and\npresenting the business case for CRM investment. As a consequence, the senior\nmanagers involved in delivering the business case, usually a project team drawn from\nMarketing, Sales, IT and Customer Service, need to address fully the questions, \u201cWhat\nsteps can we take to reduce the uncertainty in the business case for CRM?\u201d and \u201cHow do\nwe reduce the risk of business failure if we adopt a more customer-centric approach\nthrough CRM? \u201d\nIn this paper, we first identify the potential benefits of CRM investments to both\ncustomers and the firm. Then we explore the limitations of Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)\nand Net Present Value (NPV) in assessing how the CRM business case is presented. To\ncounter the problems of risk and uncertainty left largely unanswered by a cash-flow\nanalysis, we introduce the idea of Real Options as a risk-reduction step to help build the\nbusiness case for CRM investment. This we do through a simulated case study of a\ntelecom. equipment manufacturer actively considering a CRM investment. Initially, we\n3develop a range of business case scenarios for the firm, together with a cash-flow\ncalculation for each. These scenarios show wide variability, depending upon the business\nassumptions made, and we conclude that they significantly undervalue the likely effects\nof the firm\u2019s CRM investment and look very high risk indeed.\nTo help mitigate the uncertainty of such a large-scale investment, we introduce the idea\nof using Real Options in conjunction with traditional cash flow analysis to quantify the\neffects of trialling CRM before scale up as an alternative pathway for building the case\nfor CRM investment. Although Real Options have been used to manage other IT\ninvestment risks (Benaroch, 20023), as far as we are aware, this is the first time Real\nOptions have been applied in the context of a CRM investment.\nWe close the paper by exploring the managerial implications of how this combination of\ncash-flow and Real Options helps reduce uncertainty in the CRM investment decision by\nintroducing greater flexibility and a fact-based means of quantifying the business\nbenefits.\nThe Promise of CRM\nThe promise of customer relationship management is captivating. For customers, CRM\noffers the potential for customised solutions, superior service and reduced costs over the\nlifetime of their relationship with the firm since shared knowledge of their business\nstrategy, buying preferences and processes can be developed in a more systematic\nfashion. For the firm, the ability to gather customer data swiftly, identify the most\nvaluable customers over time and increase customer retention through CRM is a highly\ndesirable strategy since it positively impacts the firm\u2019s profitability (Reinartz et al,\n420044). Reinartz and co-researchers define CRM as \u201ca systematic process to manage\ncustomer relationship initiation, maintenance and termination across all customer contact\npoints to maximize the value of the relationship portfolio\u201d. Thus, CRM offers a potential\nwin: win scenario for both the firm and its customers. However, the underlying reasons\nwhy both customers and firms choose to restrict the width of their business relationships\nrequire a fuller explanation of the mutual benefits of CRM from the perspective of the\ncustomer and of the business.\nThe customer perspective\nEconomic theory predicts that customers will buy from many suppliers to reduce costs\nand improve service (Palmer, 20005). In reality, they willingly restrict their choice to a\nfew preferred suppliers or brands (Gummesson, 19986; Sheth, 19957) with whom they\neither trust or collaborate closely (Christopher, 19988, pp.190-191).\nWhilst it seems that customers act contrary to their best economic interests, economists\nacknowledge that perhaps customers are acting rationally and avoiding transaction costs\nthrough relationships (Williamson, 19819). Even where transaction costs are not a major\nconsideration, customers may yet calculate that the total lifecycle costs of owning certain\nassets or procuring services are better managed through relationships (Degerature et al.,\n199910).\nIn some markets, customer retention can be explained through the avoidance of switching\ncosts; costs associated with switching from one product or service to a new one (Shapiro\n5and Varian, 199811). For example, companies may be reluctant to change software\nbecause of the attendant costs of retraining staff, repopulating databases and potential\nconflicts with other systems. Relationships with companies that listen, learn and respond\nthrough effective CRM practices can improve the customer\u2019s procurement experience.\nWhere this happens, a virtuous cycle can develop: committed customers invest further in\ntheir focal suppliers by increasing their expenditure ( Verhoef, 200312) and suppliers\ncontinually invest in process and quality improvements to support such strong and\nenduring customer relationships (Pine, Peppers and Rogers, 199513)\nIn summary, many customers prefer to deal with a small core of supplier-partners than to\nprocure important supplies in the open market. Relationships are considered to add value\nand reduce costs, and buyers demonstrate a preference for building stable relationships\nover pure market transactions for all but straight commodities or low risk purchases.\nThe business perspective\nIn recent years, businesses have paid increasing attention to the profit impact of customer\nretention (Wyner, 199614; Johnson, 200215). Reichheld (199616) makes a compelling\nargument that it is more profitable to focus on retaining customers rather than just\nmaximising market share. Reichheld also maintains that these effects increase over time,\nso that the profitability of retained customers grows exponentially. Small changes in\ncustomer retention rates create a disproportionate increase in profitability.\nIt is the incentive of increasing customer retention and profitability through better CRM\n6practices which often drives firms to develop a more customer-centric strategy.\nHowever, effective customer retention is contingent upon market segmentation as the\nstarting point for the development of a firm\u2019s CRM strategy (Corner, 2002a17). Research\nsuggests that most firms \u2018carry\u2019 many unprofitable customers who don\u2019t generate\nmargins commensurate with the cost to serve them (Peppers and Rogers, 199718).\nPeppers and Rogers argue that, through market segmentation and CRM, firms will be\nable to identify unprofitable customers and discontinue subsidising them so that resources\ncan be redirected to retaining profitable customers, as well as attracting potentially\nprofitable ones. For businesses supporting a large number of unprofitable customers,\nrealigning the asset and cost base towards the segment of profitable customers can reduce\nthe total asset base while increasing revenue. The impact upon shareholder value is\nobvious.\nRecent research suggests that retained customers can also increase shareholder value by\nreducing the volatility of the firm\u2019s cash flow (Ryals, 200219). Serving large numbers of\ntransient customers makes cash flow volatile and creates fluctuations in short term assets,\nsuch as inventory and receivables. Investors demand greater return on investment to\ncompensate for volatile cash flow. In addition, long-term customers may contribute\nvaluable and unique learning to the firm (Wilson, 199620). Knowledge gained by a firm\nfrom its customers through CRM over time can be translated into marketing action\ntailored to individual customers. Once a customer sees a supplier acting on information it\nhas been given through CRM, there is a strong disincentive to start again with a\ncompetitive supplier. Learning from customers is particularly important in developing\n7new products \u2013 there will be fewer expensive failures when customers can input early\ninto the product development process (Thomke and von Hippel, 200221). This reduced\ndevelopment risk (or improved success of innovation) builds cash flow and reduces\noverall business risk. Indeed, many CRM advocates say that customers generate much\nmore than cash flow; they \u2018teach\u2019 firms how to improve their business (Womack, Jones\nand Roos, 199022).\nWhile the promise of CRM is beguiling, the concomitant benefits of a more customer-\ncentric strategy can only be achieved through investing in technology, people and\nprocesses; both these CRM investment costs and the risk of business failure throughout\nthe transition period can be very high.\nNext, we explore what the main assumptions are in developing the business case for\nCRM and how the financial analysis is usually presented.\nValue Exchange and the CRM Business Case\nCRM creates symbiotic value for both customers and the business. The more customers\n\u2018teach\u2019 their suppliers, the more these businesses can support and respond to them. This\nvalue exchange process lies behind the most critical business assumptions about the CRM\nbusiness case:\n1 Trust is developed. Research suggests trust is developed through repeated\nexperiences that meet or exceed customer expectations (Constable, 199823).\n2 The CRM programme has integrity. Customers will continue \u2018teaching\u2019 firms\nabout their needs and preferences for as long as they perceive benefit and therefore\nthe CRM business plan must identify how the firm will learn and respond.\n83 There is mutual commitment. The business case must identify how and why\ncustomer commitment will increase over time, and how this increased commitment\nresults in increased retention and reduced churn (Corner, 2002b24). Moreover,\ncommitment can be leveraged commercially through increased sales, referrals and\nreferences. Research suggests that committed customers are likely to buy more from\ntheir preferred supplier through choice (Coyles and Gokey, 200225).\nWe argue that traditional financial analysis forces marketing and sales management to\nidentify the outcome of the customer learning process at the outset of the CRM business\ncase. So, senior managers write these assumptions into their sales targets, and design\ncustomer relationships around what the firm wanted to sell to them in the first place\n(Maklan, 200026). This compromises the win: win scenario that underpins any CRM\nstrategy and, as we highlighted earlier, research suggests that most firms fail to achieve\ntheir targeted ROI from CRM investments (Fournier, Dobscha, and Mick, 199827;\nOlazabal, 200228; PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 200429).\nTraditional Financial Analysis of CRM\nMost CRM business cases are built upon traditional financial investment analysis tools;\nDiscounted Cash Flow (DCF) and its associated calculation of Net Present Value (NPV)\n(Ryals, Knox and Maklan, 200030). Investment policy in most firms is to create\nshareholder value by determining whether expected returns on any investment exceed the\nrisk-adjusted cost-of-capital for that type of investment.\nIn this financial model, CRM represents an investment in technology, people, new\n9processes and marketing aimed at stimulating an increase in cash flow from customers in\nfuture years through higher revenues at lower sales and marketing costs (Knox et al,\n200331). This cash flow is discounted by an appropriate charge for capital to enable\nmanagers to compare investment and return on a like-for-like basis; that is, the present\nvalue of each. If Net Present Value (NPV) is positive when cash-flows are adjusted for\nthe true cost of capital, then risk-adjusted return exceeds cost of investment.\nSophisticated users of DCF estimate a residual value for the asset at the end of the\nplanning period.\nNPV is based upon estimated incremental cash-flows that are uncertain and there are no\nguarantees that the business case will be delivered once the programme(s) starts.\nHowever, the forecasting process assumes that the business is a portfolio decision maker,\nmaking a series of investment decisions based on expected value. This is a risk reduction\nstrategy; the business makes a large number of investments, none of which will expose it\nto unacceptable risk levels (Copeland, Koller and Murrin, 199532). If each business case\nis honestly made, then investments that return less than forecast are balanced by those\nthat exceed their estimates. Across a large number of investments, provided the charge\nfor capital is appropriate, the use of DCF and NPV calculations should lead to decisions\nthat increase shareholder value.\n10\nLimitations of Using DCF and NPV alone when estimating the benefits of CRM\nInvestment\nA number of critical assumptions made by these modelling techniques are not necessarily\ntrue for CRM investment. For instance:\n1 DCF does not encourage measuring or fully valuing the non-cash value of customers\nwhich, consequently, may remain understated. Customers are worth more than cash;\nCRM should encourage customers to recruit new customers, to act as test markets for\nnew ideas and to teach firms how to continually improve their operations. These\ncustomer relationship impacts can be substantial. For instance, the world\u2019s first\ntelephone bank, first direct, claims 33% of new customers are generated from referral\n(Parmenter et al., 199733). Software companies have long valued co-operative\nproduct development with leading customers and some firms may reduce prices to\nprestigious customers who are willing both to improve and endorse their offering.\n2 The portfolio decision maker assumption may also be suspect. If an industry is in\nflux and there is a clear imperative to move to a more customer-centric business\nmodel, the firm may not have the luxury of repeated experimentation. When\ncustomer-centric change is a \u2018bet your business\u2019 initiative, DCF fails to value the\nconsequence of getting it wrong; the greater the volatility (range of possible returns),\nthe greater the option value of trialling, learning and postponing full commitment\n(Luehrman, 199834).\n3 Where there is great uncertainty around the outcome, a business case that looks at the\n11\nNPV of a best estimate scenario is not always helpful (Copeland and Keenan,\n199835). When dealing with a very wide range of outcomes, discounting the cash\nflows of a mid-point estimate may fail to address adequately the variability and risk\nof the investment.\nApplying Real Options to Overcome These Limitations\nReal Options have recently been developed as a financial analysis tool to overcome the\nlimitations of traditional financial analysis and the inability of DCF to reflect the value of\nlearning and risk management. An option is the right (not the obligation) to buy or sell\nan underlying asset, traditionally a financial asset, at some future time. Real Options are\nso called because the underlying asset is real, not financial. They are useful for valuation\nin situations in which investment decisions can be deferred, piloted or scaled; this\nflexibility has value not just because an organisation can earn interest on the capital it\nretains but also because deferring a decision until the business situation clarifies reduces\nthe uncertainty surrounding that decision (Buckley and Tse, 199636).\nThe Real Options approach modifies DCF to capture the value of flexibility, learning and\nrisk management in a project such as a major IT installation (McGrath and MacMillan,\n200037). The value of flexibility is the option to scale a project up (or down) as the\nopportunity and risks become clearer over time (McGrath, Ferrier and Mendelow,\n200438). In other words, the total value of the project is the NPV plus the value of the\noption to scale up, scale down, or to pull out (Exhibit A).\nInsert Exhibit A near here\n12\nProponents of Real Options claim that they offer a superior pricing technique and\ndecision support analysis to NPV alone; they are a particularly useful technique for\nevaluating major, future investments. Real Options have recently been demonstrated to\nhave applications in marketing (Dias and Ryals, 200240) and can offer significant benefits\nto marketers. For instance, by using Real Options, financial numbers can be put on\ndifficult, hard-to-quantify issues, such as the value of learning from customers and risk\nreduction in business decisions. By adding back the value of learning and by reducing\nthe risk of investment through exercising a Real Option, senior management is more able\nto demonstrate that apparently unattractive, or marginally attractive, CRM investments\ncan sometimes have merit.\nLike other researchers exploring the potential of Real Options in business investments\ngenerally (Boer, 200041, McGrath et al, 200442) and IT in particular ( Li and Johnson,\n200243, Kulatilaka et al, 199944), the limitations of traditional financial analysis and the\npotential contribution of Real Options can be demonstrated through a simulated case\nstudy. For the purposes of this paper, our simulated case is Westel1, a telecoms\nhardware manufacturer struggling with a CRM business case.\nDeveloping the CRM Business Case at Westel\nMary Green, Marketing Director of Westel, is leading a multi-disciplinary project team\n(the Team) tasked with preparing the CRM business case for a programme they believe\n1 Westel is a simulated case developed from actual incidents in our research and consultancy work in\nCRM. The issues discussed in the case are realistic in scope and scale.\n13\nnecessary for the firm\u2019s survival. Westel is a multinational company which provides\ntelecoms. network hardware. It has an extensive product and service range, and an\nestablished reputation in solving complex, demanding problems. Its high-end products\nform the telecoms. backbone of many of its customers and command high margins. Once\ninstalled, Westel can confidently expect the lion\u2019s share of upgrades, extensions and\nancillary services.\nCurrently, its annual turnover is \u00a3500 M, it achieves a 40% Gross Margin and a 5% Net\nContribution; SG&A and R&D represent 35% of turnover. Westel is under attack from\nnew competitors who combine solution design with hardware, installation, and network\nmanagement. These firms are disintermediating Westel from its customers and the Board\nis worried that the firm will become a low-margin, hardware supplier to these upstarts.\nMary is asked to put together a strategic response. How should Westel leverage its\nundoubted capabilities and extensive offerings to become a broad-based solution provider\nto its best customers?\nThe Team divides customers into three categories profitable; marginally profitable with\nsubstantial growth potential; and unprofitable with no prospect of becoming profitable\n(Peppers, Rogers and Dorf, 199945). In the first two categories, Westel is only selling\none-third of what it \u2018should\u2019 be achieving. Each business unit is focusing on its own\nofferings rather than total customer need. The firm is neither maximising opportunities\nacross business units nor matching sales and marketing expenditure to the opportunity.\nEach business unit pursues its own targets. To address this, Westel needs to change from\n14\nbeing product- to customer-centric. So, the Team recommends the creation of a key\naccount management function to:\n1 Integrate Westel offerings into bespoke, value-added customer solutions\n2 Co-ordinate marketing, sales and service expenses, aligning them to priority\ncustomers and development programmes\n3 Exploit the potential for referral. The Team knows that their customers network\nextensively and that Westel is not actively fostering customer referrals.\nThis programme requires substantial investment in sales and marketing, training, new\ntechnology and considerable reorganisation of the business.\nEstimating the CRM Business Case Using DCF\nThe Finance Director had advised Mary to use 10-year cash flow forecast with a discount\nrate of 15%. The costs of implementing a comprehensive CRM programme at Westel are\neasy to estimate; \u00a3227 M over ten years of which \u00a3129 M would be spent in the first three\nyears alone (see notes to Appendix 1 for more details of these costs under \u201cSuccessful\nCRM\u201d). The Team is less confident about estimating incremental revenue. They\nestimate that turnover could increase dramatically through more effective cross-selling,\ncustomers acting as reference sites and customers directing Westel to develop as yet\nunforeseen new products and services. Mary is also convinced that Westel would reduce\nmarketing and sales costs because she knows it is less expensive to serve retained\ncustomers than to continually recruit new ones. Although research costs would also rise,\nrevenue would rise faster because customers would be helping to direct research thus\nmaking it more cost-effective. Finally, the Team believes that developing more\ncomprehensive, long-term customer solutions as a result of a CRM programme would\n15\nundoubtedly lead to an increase in gross margins.\nIn preparing the business case, the Team estimates the NPV of three scenarios:\n1. \u201cSuccessful CRM\u201d: The full CRM programme increases turnover and margin\ndramatically. Research, sales and marketing expenditures increase in absolute\nterms but fall as a percentage of turnover. The result of these effects is that in 10\nyears Westel almost doubles its turnover and increases its profit four-fold.\nInvestment in R&D increases by over forty percent in cash terms. (See Appendix\n1 for a fuller explanation of Westel\u2019s projected income statements and NPVs of\nthe three scenarios).\n2. \u201cNo Change\u201d: There is no investment in CRM and consequently there is no\nchange to the current business results with respect to revenue, cost or research\ninvestment.\n3. \u201cGradual Decline\u201d: There is no investment in CRM but new competitors erode\nrevenue and margin. In ten years, Westel\u2019s revenue is 25% lower and the firm is\nless than half as profitable. Marketing, Sales and R&D spending are fixed as a\npercentage of turnover, but the 25% reduction in turnover leaves Westel less able\nto invest strategically and may compromise its future.\nDespite the dramatic difference in the outcomes generated by the three scenarios, the\nNPV estimates demonstrate only a small difference between them in value (Figure 1).\nThis is particularly true when comparing the \u201cSuccessful CRM\u201d and \u201cNo Change\u201d\nscenarios, the comparison most salient to the Board.\n16\nInsert figure 1\nOn an NPV basis alone, one cannot justify the huge investment in CRM that the Team\nbelieves is necessary for Westel\u2019s future prosperity. The problem is that nobody can\nprove with any credibility how well CRM will work or how much risk the business is at\nfrom competition. They have no basis in fact or experience for their estimates of CRM\nbenefits. For example, the Team\u2019s belief that future product ideas would generate cost\nsavings from better customer engagement is difficult to evaluate using DCF. To make\nthe case for CRM using traditional financial analysis, Mary would have to increase her\nrevenue forecasts well beyond levels that Westel\u2019s sales and marketing team could\nreasonably hope to achieve.\nThe Team is convinced that once a more customer-centric organisation was in place,\nWestel would find opportunities to reduce non-value-adding costs and identify winning\nnew business ideas. Westel would be at the \u2018top-table\u2019 with its customers - gaining\ninside knowledge both of their evolving needs and by leading through innovative\nbusiness practices. Without this access, Westel would lose its edge. Moreover, such a\ntransformation takes time; if Westel does not begin implementing CRM soon, it may be\ntoo late by the time the business case becomes apparent.\nThe Team ponders what to do. Should they be even more ambitious about the revenue\nand margin upside even though they had no firm basis? Could they scale down CRM\ninvestment and still justify their growth assumptions? Should they try to convince the\nBoard with \u2018soft\u2019, unquantifiable benefits? Should they try frightening the Board by\n17\npainting a vision of doom if Westel allowed competitors to consolidate their hold on its\nbest customers?\nAnalysis of the Westel\u2019s CRM Business Case\nWestel needs to become customer-centric. But the only way to make a compelling\nbusiness case based upon NPV is to make heroic assumptions about increased revenue,\nreduced cost and the risks of \u2018do nothing\u2019. Forecasting large increases in revenue based\non beliefs, experts\u2019 claims and hard-to-verify estimates of best practice is risky.\nMoreover, it assumes that you know the outcome of stronger customer relationships\nbefore entering into them. Locking Westel into pre-identified, cross-selling programmes\nand new product launches risks compromising the trust and learning which is at the heart\nof CRM. Investing more in the current business practices might generate more immediate\nreturn. Smaller initial investments giving short-term returns are favoured in NPV\ncalculations because the discount rate \u2013 the time value of money \u2013 dramatically reduces\nbenefits that are realised only in the long term.\nBut what will happen to Westel if Mary and Board are right about the increased\ncompetitive threat? How should senior managers assess the risk of being too cautious? If\nthey fail to implement CRM now, can they come back later or will they have missed the\nchance forever?\nDCF, not surprisingly, is best used when the situation can be described in cash flow\nterms. It fails to value what Westel will learn from its customers \u2013 a major CRM benefit.\nIt also favours the short over the long term. DCF\/NPV is not good at assessing the longer\n18\nterm, and potentially fatal risk facing Westel. If the competitive threat materialises, then\nDCF will lead Westel to seriously underestimate the benefits of the CRM investment case\nand by the time this is understood, it may be too late to implement the far-reaching\nchanges needed to respond in a timely fashion.\nThe Westel Solution: Applying Real Options\nThe Team should avoid the use of heroic assumptions in the business. They are likely to\nbe controversial when held up to scrutiny by experienced directors and the sales function.\nMoreover, if they are accepted, the pressure for immediate sales increases to customers\nwill undermine any serious attempt at learning and responding to customers flexibly. The\nproblem Mary faces is how to present financial data in a manner that promotes an\nintelligent discussion with the Board, identifies the key assumptions and risks of the\ninvestment and builds an informed consensus on the basis of valid information.\nReviewing the project, the Team generates a fourth scenario. Rather than an all-or-\nnothing rollout of CRM, they identify a limited number of key accounts with which CRM\nwill be trialled. The ability to trial CRM indicates that a Real Option on CRM is present.\nThe value of this option is the value of flexibility which reduces the risks associated with\nthe CRM investment whilst increasing senior manager\u2019s learning about the returns of\nCRM for the firm. The Team estimates that it will take three years to implement and\n\u201cread\u201d the CRM trial after which time, the Board can make the decision whether or not to\ndiscontinue the trial (or scale it up) according to the firmer evidence provided by the\nTeam\u2019s analysis of the key accounts involved.\n19\nThe DCF calculation of this fourth scenario, Trial CRM, is made on the basis of a three\nyear trial costing \u00a336 M in terms of CRM investment. If the trial is successful, CRM can\nthen be extended quickly across the business. However, if the trial is unsuccessful,\nWestel would not extend CRM and the firm will have \u201clost\u201d \u00a336 M which puts much less\ninvestment at risk than the \u00a3129 M required for immediate implementation of CRM\nacross the business during the same three year period. (See Appendix 1 and notes for the\ndetailed, year-by-year calculations of Trial CRM investments and Net Contribution).\nOn a DCF basis alone, this option does not appear to make sense (Figure 2). The impact\nof the delay is to reduce the overall NPV of the CRM project to \u00a3107 M; much lower\nthan a possible \u00a3133 M for the Successful CRM scenario and only marginally better than\nthe Gradual Decline scenario. This perhaps indicates why so many organisations have\nplunged into full-scale CRM rollout with sometimes costly results. Conventional DCF\napproaches understate the true value of trialling because they ignore the option value.\nInsert Figure 2\nHowever, the Trial scenario buys flexibility for Westel. It allows the firm to validate the\nTeam\u2019s forecast of the impact upon revenue and costs of the CRM programme and be in\na position to extend the programme across the business in a timely fashion should these\nbenefits prove real. Flexibility and the attendant risk reduction are not cash flows and,\nhence, are omitted in a pure DCF comparison of the four scenarios. Mary must work\nwith Finance to value the flexibility contained within the fourth scenario, Trial CRM.\nFirst, they need to calculate the numerical values for the five factors that affect the value\nof this real CRM option. These are shown in Figure 3:\n20\nInsert Figure 3\nThen, Mary and her finance colleagues use the numbers in Figure 3 to work out the value\nof Westel\u2019s CRM Real Option. Because of the complexity of options valuation models,\nthey decide to calculate an approximate option valuation using look-up tables based on\nthe Black and Scholes equations set out earlier (p11). (Brealey and Myers36).\nTo find the relevant column, the asset value (\u00a3107m) must be divided by the present\nvalue of the exercise price (\u00a3195m discounted at r of 15% = \u00a3102.2m). This comes to\n1.05 (\u00a3107m\/\u00a3102.2m).\nTo find the relevant row, the volatility of the underlying asset must be multiplied by the\nsquare root of the time period for which the option is available (.32 x \u221a3) = 0.554.\nApplying these numbers to the look-up tables, the Team is able to determine that the\nvalue of Westel\u2019s CRM option is approximately \u00a325 M.\nMary\u2019s argument to the Board is summarised in Figure 4 which shows the NPV of each\nscenario, including the new scenario four, Trial CRM, which also has an option value.\nWhen the value of the flexibility provided by trialling CRM is added to the cash flow\ngenerated, the total value of scenario four is very marginally lower than the potentially\nmuch higher-risk option, scenario one, of rolling out a full CRM project immediately.\nInsert figure 4\nBy calculating the value of Westel\u2019s CRM option, the Team is in a much stronger\nposition to recommend that the firm market tests CRM with a limited number of\ncustomers over a three year period in order to validate the business case assumptions\n21\nabout revenue and costs. The firm should then be in the position to implement a full-scale\nCRM programme shortly afterwards. With three years experience of CRM, Westel will\nbe able to reduce the wide spread in NPV estimates for CRM. In other words, the firm\nwill be able to reduce the risk of its CRM investment. This risk will also be reduced\nthrough market testing of CRM that will allow Westel to build competencies, resources\nand a track record of learning relationships with customers.\nThe discussion of risk in respect of scenario one, Successful CRM, raises an issue about\nthe interest rate used in the calculations. The same interest rate is used in all four\nscenarios. However, common sense suggests that the Successful CRM scenario is more\nrisky than the others and, as such, it should attract a higher cost of capital (discount rate).\nThis would have the effect of reducing the NPV of Successful CRM whilst increasing the\noption value associated with Trial CRM since, as discussed above, the value of a Real\nOption varies positively with the interest rate. Thus, the approach taken to valuing\nWestel\u2019s CRM option may be slightly conservative.\nThe identification of a supportable financial value for the factors, which are not captured\nin the DCF, allows the Board to engage in an informed debate and make a rational\nassessment of the value of CRM. It addresses the Finance Director\u2019s concern about\nadding such values into a DCF analysis but does not fall into the trap of either ignoring\nthe value or incorporating it in a non-transparent manner through heroic sales growth\nassumptions.\n22\nManagerial Implications of using Real Options for CRM Project Evaluation\nThere are two important implications for CRM project managers concerning how they\nmake the business case for CRM and the way in which they structure and implement\nsubsequent CRM programmes. Many CRM projects fail, indicating that they are risky. In\nthese circumstances, making a case using DCF \/ NPV will misrepresent the real value of\nprojects that contain options. The greater the uncertainty, the greater the option value.\nMaking a case for CRM based solely on DCF may deter senior managers from investing\nin CRM because the potential is understated.\nThe Westel example demonstrates the limitations of financial models (DCF\/NPV) which\nsenior managers typically use when building the business case for CRM. Faced with the\nconstraints of considering only the immediately identifiable cash flows, firms may tend to\nunderestimate the true value of the benefits derived from CRM, such as learning from\nkey customers and building their trust. This means that business leaders may not invest\nin such a programme, leaving their firms vulnerable to competitors. Real Options can\nhelp demonstrate the true potential of CRM investment.\nThe CRM business case is a major strategic document and not merely a financial\nforecasting exercise. It represents a fundamental change to the business and should be\nevaluated as a strategic, risky and contingent investment in an unknown future. The\nchallenge for senior managers is to promote a discussion that identifies the extent to\nwhich their business must move from a traditional \u201cmake and sell\u201d model to \u201clisten and\nrespond\u201d in an unknown future and real options thinking can help to generate this\n23\ndiscussion.\nThe second implication concerns the way in which managers structure and implement\nCRM programmes. The Westel case illustrates the benefits of options thinking and of\nstructuring CRM programmes to create options to defer, pilot or upscale major CRM\ninvestments. Without options thinking, companies may fail to build into the programme\nsufficient flexibility to learn from customers, which could compromise the huge\ninvestment that CRM requires. It can, therefore, enable a rational discussion of risk and\nflexibility in the search to optimise the structuring of CRM investments and the\nimplementation of programmes. Moreover, in the time before the option must be\nexercised, the three years of the Westel Trial CRM in this case, senior management\nattention will be focused on validating the key assumptions built into the business case.\nThis will promote a rigorous, fact-based means of quantifying CRM benefits.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to offer our thanks to the three blind referees who provided valuable\nfeedback during each drafting stage of our paper and to the continued support, advice and\nenthusiasm of the Editor-in-Chief.\nReferences\n1Ebner, M., Hu, A., Levitt, D. and McCrory, J., \u201cHow to Rescue CRM\u201d, McKinsey\nQuarterly, Issue 4, pp. 49-57.

The amount it costs to exercise the option (E)\n3. The interest rate (r)\n4. The period for which the option is available (t)\n5. The volatility of the underlying asset (Nd)\nThe value of an option is given by the equation:\nP0 = PsN(d1) \u2013 E N(d2)\nert\nwhere e is an exponential constant\nThe value of the option is related positively to all these factors except the second, the\nexercise price (E). In other words, the bigger the value of the underlying asset (Ps),\nthe higher the interest rate (r), the longer the period for which the option is available\n(t), and the greater the volatility in value of the underlying asset (Nd), the higher the\nvalue of the option is to buy (Amram and Kulatilaka, 199939).\n1Figures: Long Range Planning, Volume 38, Issue 4, August 2005, Pages 393-410\nFigure

defended\nthrough CRM. This base is augmented by layers of incremental revenues identified in\nthe case. The incremental revenues are estimates generated by Mary in conjunction\nwith partners in Sales and outside consultants with experience in CRM programme\ndevelopment. In order of importance, these incremental revenues are:\n\uf0b7 Increased cross selling to current customers. The immediate focus of CRM\nis to extend and enhance that which Westel sells to its customers, leveraging\nits good reputation and incumbency in major users of telecoms equipment.\nWhilst there are some revenues generated in year 1, the impact of cross selling\nwill grow over subsequent years as Westel learns how to profit from enhanced\nrelationships. The rate of revenue growth decreases in the final years of the 10\nyear period to reflect eventual diminishing returns from cross selling.\n\uf0b7 New referrals. The CRM programme will identify those customers for whom\nWestel is adding the most value and where the relationship is strongest -\nconverting customers\u2019 good will towards Westel into sales leads, references\nand general endorsement of Westel\u2019s qualities. Referrals, references and\nendorsements are important win-bidding developments for large telecoms\ninfrastructure projects, given the amount of money and risk they entail. The\nreferral effect also starts slowly, grows more rapidly for a few years and then\ntails off in the later years of the forecasted period.\n\uf0b7 New business ideas. This is the most difficult area to estimate as it estimates\nthe ability of Westel to exploit commercially ideas that are generated through\nlearning from future customer interactions. The revenue generation is lagged\nto the learning to reflect the time it takes to work more intimately with clients,\ndevelop new ideas with them, assess their wider commercial potential and\nintroduce the new ideas to a larger number of customers. The forecast suggests\nthat it will take almost four years to realise any significant income from this\nform of learning from customers.\nGross margin\nCRM will allow Westel to allocate better its resources and re-engineer its business\nprocesses to provide more of what its best customers value and less of what customers\ndo not appreciate or are unwilling to pay for. This better matching of resources and\nprocesses to customer value will reduce costs incurred that add little value and allow\n10\nWestel to produce more valued services and products, which all else being equal,\nshould sell at premium prices. The revenue from this is assumed to be lagged by one\nyear to the start of CRM but adds one-half point of margin thereafter. The final figure\nof 44.5% is considered by Mary to be achievable in consideration of her analysis of\nbest-practice competitors.\nOther Costs\nThese increase in absolute terms over 10 years but not as fast as income. For example,\nR&D increases from its current level of \u00a375 M (15% of \u00a3500 M turnover) to \u00a3107.5\nM (12.5% of year 10 turnover). Moreover, R&D priorities will be more targeted on\nspecific customer opportunities and hence less speculative and more cost-effective.\nIncremental CRM Costs\nTechnology\nThis comprises CRM software implementation over 18 months. The major\ncomponents are sales force automation, new customer contact (call) centre, enhanced\nweb access, new customer database, new database analysis tools and improved\nintegration of the contact centre with Westel\u2019s logistic and billing systems. Integrating\nthese new sales, marketing and service systems together and then to the back office\nsupport systems is a major systems development. The logistics and billing systems\nhad not been built to integrate seamlessly into new, state-of-the-art front office\nsystems that Westel would need and would require extensive use of outside systems\ndevelopment and integration consultants. The new front office equipment would\nstretch existing computer hardware and servers beyond their capability and new\nequipment would be needed.\nThe key investments are as follows:\nNew sales systems to 1000 field sales people \u00a310,000,000\nNew lap tops to field sales people 5,000,000\nNew sales systems to 500 desk based sales people 2,500,000\nNew service software for 1000 service people 5,000,000\nNew marketing systems for 500 marketers 2,500,000\nOther new hardware (servers, LANs, etc) 2,500,000\nNew database and analytical tools 5,000,000\nSystems integration, process development (consulting fees) 17,500,000\nUpgrades to logistics and billing systems 15,000,000\nTotal 65,000,000\n11\nThe investment was front loaded with \u00a340M in the first year and \u00a325 M in year two.\nCommencing in year three, IT estimated an ongoing cost of \u00a35 M per annum for\nsoftware upgrades, license fees and miscellaneous new maintenance costs.\nReorganisation\nThe sales force would be reorganised into profit-responsible customer teams and lead\nWestel's business and product planning processes. It would need new competencies in\ncustomer development, planning, financial analysis, risk assessment and budgeting.\nProduct groups would need a reorientation to adapt a more \u201clisten and serve\u201d\napproach to their jobs. This represented the biggest-ever change for Westel\u2019s Sales\norganisation in its history.\nAfter advice from change-management consulting firms, Mary estimated an 18 month\nimplementation of the change with \u00a315 million, one-off cost spread equally over the\nperiod; \u00a310 million in year one and \u00a35 million in the second year. The costs relate to\nhiring outside change-management consultants and facilities, food and travel for the\nattendant workshops and re-training sessions.\nPeople\nNot all the current Westel people would be able and or willing to make the transition\nfrom a product to a customer-led structure. Mary estimated that 20% of the current\nmarketing and sales people would either leave or be replaced during the first 18\nmonths of the CRM implementation.\nMary worked with HR specialists to estimate the costs involved. In considering the\npeople, their flexibility and ongoing level of staff turnover, the specialists suggest a\nfirst year cost of \u00a310 million relating to personal coaching and training for those that\ncan make the transition to key account management, coaching of others to consider\nother opportunities within Westel and severance pay for those that will neither make\nthe transition to the new organisation nor find an acceptable position elsewhere. There\nwill be only limited recruitment from the outside in the first year of the CRM\nprogramme to allow Westel people the best opportunity and minimise disruption.\nThereafter, there is a cost of \u00a35M per annum for recruiting new people and additional\nseverance pay.\nMarketing\nWestel did not traditionally spend heavily in marketing, instead relying on its\nreputation and sales force for reputation and positioning. Current marketing budgets\nwere hard to estimate as spending was fragmented across individual product groups\nand not always identified as marketing. Mary was convinced that repositioning Westel\nfrom hardware vendor to solutions-partner would require a much larger investment in\nmarketing communications behind the corporate brand. Westel had never before\ninvested specifically in corporate brand building.\n12\nDuring the first two years of the change programme, Mary budgeted for a \u00a320 million\nglobal communication programme directed at customers and opinion-formers. The\nobjectives of the communication programme were to promote the new strategy and\ndiscourage rumours that Westel lacks a clear strategy. Thereafter marketing budgets\nwould fall to approx. \u00a34 million per annum, but not to the very low current levels.\nMary felt that as Westel changed its focus from product-marketing to customer-\nsolutions, it would need to maintain a strong corporate brand to endorse its credentials\nas a long-term business partner.\nNotes for Appendix 1: Trial CRM\nMary is able to identify a limited number of customers with whom Westel can engage\nin the type of relationship that is planned for all customers under the \u201csuccessful CRM\nscenario\u201d. The technology, reorganisation, people and marketing investments required\nare as per above, but on a much smaller scale. Many of the software solutions can be\ndelayed during the trial in favour of enhancements to current systems and additional\nstaff. These short-term fixes are not scaleable to support all of Westel\u2019s business but\ncan be operated for a limited time for a limited number of companies.\nThis scenario illustrates a three year investment that is successful and hence allows\nWestel to extend CRM across the company in year 4. The slower pace of\nimplementation is actually less expensive in a few areas over a four year period\nbecause it avoids the disruptiveness of quick-paced, major change (e.g. People costs).\nHowever the major assumptions about the extent and pace of incremental revenue\ndevelopment and technology costs are very similar to those used in the successful\nCRM scenario albeit lagged to reflect the three year test market.\n"}
