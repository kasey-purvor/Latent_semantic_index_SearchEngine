INTRODUCTION 37 \nNatural sports turf has many roles in the landscape other than the primary function of their 38 \ndesign for competition or recreation, including storing and cycling essential nutrients. Sports 39 \nand amenity turf provide the capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon through soil organic 40 \ncarbon accumulation [1, 2] however mechanisation in the maintenance of turfgrass, and the 41 \napplication of synthetic fertilisers and agrochemicals, results in emissions of CO2.  42 \nAnthropogenic emissions of CO2, have resulted in an estimated global temperature increase 43 \nof 0.74 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b0C in the last 100 years with an expected rise of at least 1.1 \u00b0C by the end of 44 \nthe 2050 [3]. The combustion of fossil fuels releases approximately 6.3 Pg C y\n-1\n, while only 45 \n2.9 Pg C y\n-1\n is sequestered by plants [4]. Political, public and economic pressures have 46 \nincreased on industries to account for, and reduce, carbon emissions at a global scale (cf. The 47 \nKyoto protocol and the Copenhagen agreement). Life cycle assessment (LCA) determines the 48 \ncontribution of a product or process to the anthropogenic release of carbon into the 49 \natmosphere as CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) [5]; natural sports turf delivers its \u201eproduct\u201f 50 \nin terms of aesthetics and functionality for specific activities, rather than in terms of total 51 \noutput capacity.  52 \n 53 \nPlants act as a sink for CO2 by fixing carbon during photosynthesis and storing excess carbon 54 \nas biomass in their leaves and roots. Managed turfgrass is commonly assumed to be a net sink 55 \nfor atmospheric CO2 although these assumptions have recently been questioned [6, 7]. Other 56 \nresearch has indicated that managed grassland areas in the UK lost soil carbon at a rate of 57 \n0.25 kg C m\n-2\n y\n-1\n, between 1978 and 2003 [8]. A recent study indicated that there had been no 58 \nnet change in carbon storage between 1982 and 2006 from long-term experimental grasslands 59 \nwhich have been identically managed for over 100 years [9]. The accumulation of soil 60 \norganic matter in managed sports turf systems has been shown to be greater than less-61 \nFinal draft of Bartlett and James (2011). Proc IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and Tech, 225: 75-83, doi:10.1177\/1754337110396014 \n \nintensively managed grassland systems due to accelerated biogeochemical cycling from 62 \nclipped leaf nitrogen and nitrogen fertiliser application [1, 2, 6, 10]; and sustained crop cover 63 \nand reduced soil disturbance compared to agriculture [11]. The plants that make up a natural 64 \nturf sports facility are capable of sequestering these emissions of CO2 as part of the global 65 \ncarbon cycle.  66 \n 67 \nThis paper focuses on the balance of CO2 emissions and sequestration in the turf grass 68 \nsystem, as elemental carbon. The sequestration capacity of managed turf only represents one, 69 \nrelatively small, component of the whole-system C cycling on in sports turf. The use of 70 \nmowing equipment, fertilisers and other agrochemicals, all cause emissions of CO2, either 71 \ndirectly during use and maintenance or during their manufacture [11-13]. A clear 72 \nunderstanding of the role of amenity turf in the global carbon cycle and the dynamics of 73 \nwhole-system C balances are essential for informing the debate on overall sustainability in 74 \nturfgrass management. To address this we pose two research questions: 75 \n1. What are the total annual C emissions from the maintenance of a natural sports turf, and 76 \nhow does this balance against a sports facilities capacity to sequester carbon?  77 \n2. How do C emissions vary for differently managed areas of sports turf, and how do the 78 \nmanagement techniques affect these emissions throughout the year? 79 \n 80 \n2. METHODOLOGY  81 \n2.1. Model development 82 \nThere are a wide range of operations or processes in the management of turfgrass that result 83 \nin the release of CO2 into the atmosphere. Therefore, to address the research questions, a 84 \nmechanistic model of turfgrass maintenance was developed, and applied to sports turf in the 85 \ncontext of a UK golf course. The system boundary for this model included emissions of C 86 \nFinal draft of Bartlett and James (2011). Proc IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and Tech, 225: 75-83, doi:10.1177\/1754337110396014 \n \nfrom mowing, agrochemical application, fertiliser application and irrigation. Emissions from 87 \nthe production of fertilizer and agrochemicals were also inside the system boundary. Any 88 \nemissions that resulted from the manufacture of machinery used for maintenance or the 89 \nconstruction of the golf course infrastructure were excluded and outside the system boundary.  90 \n 91 \nThe model was developed using principles similar to Dalgaard et al., [14] and Ammann et 92 \nal., [15]. Based on a simple mass balance equation, emissions from maintenance are balanced 93 \nagainst the turfgrass sequestration capacity for the whole golf course system (Equation 1). 94 \nWhen the output from the model is positive, then there is a net release of carbon for the 95 \nmaintenance of the modelled turf area, where the value is negative, the grass is acting as a 96 \nsink for atmospheric CO2, with carbon stored within the system. 97 \n             (1)  98 \nWhere T is the total carbon efflux for an area of sports turf in g C m\n-2\n y\n-1\n, R is the carbon 99 \nefflux from maintenance, defined by Equation 2, and S is the total carbon sequestered into the 100 \nplant-soil system derived from analysis of soil organic matter accumulation in a study of golf 101 \ncourses soils in Colorado, USA [2]. The derived value is averaged across a range of soil 102 \ntypes, previous land uses, grass species and other management practices, see Qian and Follet 103 \n[2] for further details. 104 \n                   (2)  105 \nWhere \u03a3a is the sum of all the carbon released from the CO2 emissions from the use and 106 \napplication of agrochemicals; \u03a3f is the sum of the carbon released from the CO2 emissions 107 \nfrom the manufacture and use of fertilizer; \u03a3i is the sum the carbon released from the CO2 108 \nemissions associated with applying irrigation water; \u03a3m is the sum of carbon released from 109 \nall the CO2 emissions associated with mowing.

The model makes calculations over a fixed area, on a 114 \nmonthly basis, for the period of one year. Estimations of error were made using 10\n6 \nMonte 115 \nCarlo simulations for each of the input constants, assuming a standard deviation of 10% [16-116 \n22].

Golf course analysis 120 \nA private member, Parkland golf course (where the golf course is laid out among a wooded 121 \nlandscape) in Berkshire, UK was selected for analysis using the model described in Equations 122 \n1-3. This golf course had detailed historic records of their maintenance programme for each 123 \ndifferently managed turfgrass area (in terms of increasing intensity of management: mown 124 \nrough, fairways, tees, greens), from which all the input parameters required were derived 125 \n(Table 2). Management data used for the modelling were taken from 2008, which represented 126 \nan average climatic year, with annual rainfall of 657 mm and 1585 hours of sunshine 127 \ncompared to the preceding 10 year average (rainfall: 652 \u00b1 39 mm; sunshine: 1636 \u00b1 52 h). 128 \nThe area of different turf types was measured using aerial photographic interpretation. Each 129 \ndifferent turf type was managed using different machinery with differing fuel consumptions 130 \nand engine oil capacities. Greens and tees were modelled using pedestrian mowers; fairways 131 \nand mown roughs were modelled using self-propelled machinery with larger engines, fuel 132 \nand oil consumptions [23]. All maintenance machinery used at this golf course is replaced on 133 \na rolling five year cycle.  134 \nFinal draft of Bartlett and James (2011). Proc IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and Tech, 225: 75-83, doi:10.1177\/1754337110396014 \n \n 135 \nDifferences between areas of the golf course that were modelled were compared using one-136 \nway ANOVA. All modelling and data analysis was carried out using MATLAB 7.7 137 \n(MathWorks Inc., Cambridge, UK). 138 \n3. RESULTS & DISCUSSION 139 \nEach area of the golf course had significantly different CO2 emissions from maintenance on 140 \nan equal area basis (p<0.01, Table 3a). The greens accounted for 2.7 times the emissions of 141 \nthe mown rough areas, as result of the differences in the use of nitrogen fertiliser and 142 \nincreased mowing frequency (Table 2). The difference in the emissions between the tees and 143 \nthe fairways was also smaller by comparison to the rough (Table 3a). The increased intensity 144 \nof these management inputs, typified by the amount of N fertiliser used, showed a strong 145 \nlinear relationship with the mean net C balance as would be expected for a linear model 146 \n(Figure 1, r\n2\n = 0.973). In addressing our research questions, the model shows that there are 147 \nsignificant differences in the emissions of carbon from maintenance on an equal area basis 148 \n(Table 3a; p<0.01). These findings show that the management practices of different playing 149 \nareas of a golf course are key in the scale of their capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon. 150 \nThese differences are directly related to their function and the management strategies that 151 \nmust be applied to them to achieve optimal playing conditions.  152 \n 153 \nAnalysis showed that when scaled to the areas of the whole golf course, the higher emissions 154 \nfrom the tees and greens were diluted because of the relatively small proportions of the total 155 \narea of the golf course that they occupy (Table 3b). The emissions per square metre of mown 156 \nrough were considerably lower than the other land use types, but the nature of golf course 157 \ndesign meant that this surface type was the dominant management feature. The lower 158 \nintensity of management of this component of the golf course means that the rough is capable 159 \nFinal draft of Bartlett and James (2011). Proc IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and Tech, 225: 75-83, doi:10.1177\/1754337110396014 \n \nof sequestering 22.5 Mg C per year for this golf course. This surface type accounted for 31% 160 \nof the area of the whole facility, and 53.6% of the total CO2 emissions (Table 3b).  161 \n 162 \nTo analyse the relationships between management strategies and the CO2 emissions, the 163 \noutput of the model was evaluated on a month-by-month basis. The cumulative emissions of 164 \neach of the sum terms in Equation 2 are shown as stacked bars for each area of the golf 165 \ncourse in Figure 2. The CO2 emissions of each surface shows clear seasonal trends, because 166 \nbetween April and September the grass grows more rapidly, and requires more intensive 167 \nmanagement to maintain playing quality. For all areas of the golf course, surfaces peaked as a 168 \nnet source for carbon emissions in either June or July (Figure 2).  169 \n 170 \nFor all surfaces, emissions from mowing dominated the monthly breakdown of the 171 \ncontributions to emissions, closely followed by fertilisers and agrochemicals. Management 172 \ndecisions, player perceptions and machinery efficiency all contribute to the carbon emissions 173 \nassociated with golf course maintenance. Advancement in mowing technology could result in 174 \nconsiderable emissions reductions in the future. Figure 2 clearly highlights that the largest 175 \ncontributions to the emissions from the management came from mowing (Figure 2; \u2211m). 176 \nPlant growth shows seasonal patterns of above ground vegetative growth [25, 26], however 177 \nthe practice of mowing slowly growing or senescent turfgrass is carried out because in 178 \namenity turf management, cutting above-ground growth is only one function of mowing.  179 \nMowing is also used to condition and maintain the quality of the playing surface to achieve 180 \noptimum function [23]. The specific approach that the golf course manager takes to 181 \nmaintaining the turf in terms of presentation determines the efficiency of mowing and the 182 \nassociated fuel usage [20, 23]. At the highest standard golf courses some golf course 183 \nmanagers use the \u201cdouble cutting\u201d technique (Figure 3) to help maintain turfgrass health. 184 \nFinal draft of Bartlett and James (2011). Proc IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and Tech, 225: 75-83, doi:10.1177\/1754337110396014 \n \nWhen turfgrass is consistently mown in one orientation the grass plant will respond by 185 \ngrowing in the same orientation. This can lead to a reduction in playing quality of the 186 \nturfgrass. Two passes with a mower, at right angles to a each other can help to prevent this 187 \nproblem occurring. This approach to mowing also produces the most commercially and 188 \naesthetically desirable chequered pattern to the turf grass (Figure 3b), such as the course 189 \nmodelled here. However, it requires the mower to cover twice the distance and to change 190 \ndirection 2.6 times more than for the most efficient mowing pattern (Figure 3). A reduction in 191 \nmowing intensity of the greens of this golf course in line with the mowing pattern shown in 192 \nFigure 3a would reduce the emissions from this area of the golf course by 35.3 g C m\n-2\n y\n-1\n, 193 \ni.e. equivalent to more than the emissions of the mown rough area (Table 3a). Figure 2 also 194 \nidentifies that emissions may be reduced by reducing fertiliser inputs in late autumn, when 195 \nthe risk of leaching losses are high and plants uptake of nitrogen is low [24]. Reductions in 196 \nfertiliser use at this time could therefore facilitate a reduction in emissions from tees and 197 \ngreens. Significant reductions could be achieved by educating players and media in the 198 \nenvironmental consequences of aesthetic presentation.  199 \n 200 \nThe annual carbon budget for the whole golf course was calculated by scaling the mean 201 \nemissions from each area of the golf course to the total area of that playing surface (Table 202 \n3b). Total CO2 annual emissions for the managed turf areas of this golf course were estimated 203 \nto be 10.75 Mg C y\n-1\n, with a net carbon balance of -33.01 Mg C y\n-1\n. In a life cycle analysis of 204 \nwinter wheat (Triticum aestivum) production in Europe, emissions were estimated to be 0.66 205 \nMg C ha\n-1\n y\n-1\n [27], i.e. comparable to the emissions from the golf course greens (Table 3b). 206 \nHowever, the total area of this feature of the golf course is only 1.4 ha, or 1.5% of the golf 207 \ncourse area. The other, less intensively managed areas of the course compensate for the high 208 \nemissions from this surface type. 209 \nFinal draft of Bartlett and James (2011). Proc IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and Tech, 225: 75-83, doi:10.1177\/1754337110396014 \n \n 210 \nTrees also sequester CO2 from the atmosphere and store it as C in wood (-3 Mg C ha\n-1\n cover 211 \ny\n-1\n; [29]). At this golf course, 52.1% (48.1 ha) of the facility was non-play areas, 212 \npredominantly planted with mature woodland. This results in a significant impact on the net 213 \ncarbon balance for the whole golf course. Assuming that the majority of the trees are mature, 214 \nand planted at a typical urban woodland density [29], they would provide an estimated annual 215 \nsequestration rate of -144.3 Mg C y\n-1\n. Therefore the whole golf course net carbon balance 216 \nwas -177.3 Mg C y\n-1\n; equivalent to -1.93 Mg C ha\n-1\n y\n-1\n for the whole golf course. The 217 \nemissions from the intensive management of the sports turf only accounts for 6% of the 218 \nwhole carbon budget for the total golf course area, with the remainder being sequestration. 219 \nTherefore, this golf course functions as a sink in the carbon cycle on an annual basis. The 220 \ngolf course modelled sequesters more carbon than arable wheat production [27], but less than 221 \nagro-forestry producing biomass for fuel by a factor of four [29]. The architecture and design 222 \nof this golf course with the predominance of trees has a greater influence on the carbon 223 \nbudget for the golf course than the mechanisation of the management. This may not be the 224 \ncase for other golf courses or sports facilities which have smaller areas of tress. Amenity 225 \nturfgrass facilities should aim to reduce emissions, regardless of their offset capacity 226 \nhowever; well managed golf course design is instrumental in determining the benefit of 227 \nsports turf over another form of land use.  228 \n 229 \nThe model has a number of constraints that are important when considering these results. 230 \nDespite extensive sensitivity analysis, the model is limited by its lack of external validation, a 231 \ncommon problem with this approach of life cycle assessment [30, 31]. Research into carbon 232 \nbudgeting of urban and managed grasslands of the type modelled is significantly 233 \nunderrepresented in academic research [32], therefore there are relatively limited sources of 234 \nFinal draft of Bartlett and James (2011). Proc IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and Tech, 225: 75-83, doi:10.1177\/1754337110396014 \n \nvalidation data. Full validation will require both field and laboratory experimentation to 235 \ndetermine if the predicted emissions for each process correspond to those suggested by the 236 \nmodel. Further research is also required to validate the assumptions of sequestration rate of 237 \nturf grass in the UK climate. The approach taken models the carbon budget of the 238 \nmaintenance of sports turf, and the constants within the model represent the emission of CO2 239 \nas carbon. However, in terms of the impact of sports turf on global climate change, emissions 240 \nof CO2 only represent one of the sources of gaseous emissions from golf courses that have 241 \nglobal warming implications. Other gases such as nitrogen dioxide and nitrous oxide (N2O) \u2013 242 \nreleased from fertiliser use and methane (CH4) from the decomposition of green waste play 243 \nsignificant roles in global warming [7]. These gasses have a comparatively greater role in the 244 \ngreenhouse effect; N2O has 298 times the global warming potential compared to CO2 [3, 21, 245 \n22].  246 \n 247 \n4. SUMMARY 248 \nThrough the development of a simple mass balance model it has been possible to address the 249 \nover-arching question of whether land managed for amenity turf, such as that of a golf course 250 \nis a net source or sink of carbon in the atmosphere. The model shows that while the 251 \nmanagement of the turf grass on golf courses consistently results in a release of CO2, the 252 \nother features of the landscape of the golf course, including the turf grass itself, are 253 \ninstrumental in counter-balancing these releases.  254 \n 255 \nThe results of this modelling exercise are not sensibly extrapolated to determine a CO2 256 \nbalance for golf courses across the whole of the UK. Site specific factors, such as landscape, 257 \ngolf course architecture, and the specific management strategy for maintaining the golf 258 \ncourse have been shown to have a considerable impact on the overall results of the model. 259 \nFinal draft of Bartlett and James (2011). Proc IMechE Part P: J Sports Eng and Tech, 225: 75-83, doi:10.1177\/1754337110396014 \n \nThe area of trees varies between parkland courses and is dependent on landscape and other 260 \nland-use pressures; this could result in less net sequestration than the golf course modelled 261 \nhere.  The area of fine turf (sources), compared to the size and vegetative composition of the 262 \nmown rough and other non play areas (sinks) will vary between courses. Even for courses 263 \nthat have similar landscape features, the standard of golf played on the course will have a 264 \nstrong effect on the specific management strategies and policies of the golf course manager. 265 \nThis in turn will impact on the size of the source of the emissions from turf grass 266 \nmanagement. Further research is required applying the model described here in a range of 267 \nmanagement scenarios, determining the influence of players perception on the net carbon 268 \nbalance of a golf course.    269 \n 270 \nThe position of a golf course in the landscape is also likely to have an influence on the net 271 \ncarbon balance. A coastal \u201eLinks\u201f style golf course, where the landscape typically has few 272 \ntrees and the vegetation of the non playing areas and \u201dout of bounds\u201d areas are dominated by 273 \ncoastal sedges and grasses, are likely to be different from the findings reported here. The 274 \nagrochemical inputs to this style of golf course, especially with regard to fertiliser use, are 275 \noften lower than for parkland courses. Therefore, the carbon budget, and resultant 276 \nenvironmental impact must be assessed on a course by course basis. Through careful 277 \nmanagement of the whole land area of a golf course, reduction of maintenance inputs could 278 \nmean that natural sports turf can add further value to the landscape, beyond providing areas 279 \nfor recreation and sport.  280 \n 281 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 282 \nFinal draft of Bartlett and James (2011).
