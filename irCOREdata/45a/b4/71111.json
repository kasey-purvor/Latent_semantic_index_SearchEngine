Introduction\n[2] Many experiments involving the modification of the\nionosphere with high-power, high-frequency (HF) radio\nwaves have been performed in the past. These investiga-\ntions make use of large ground-based facilities commonly\nreferred to as HF facilities or heating facilities. The world\u2019s\nmajor HF facilities are (were) the Arecibo observatory,\nPuerto Rico (the Arecibo facility, 18.35\u0001N, 66.75\u0001W was\noperated from 1971 to 1978; and the Islote facility, 18.48\u0001N,\n66.66\u0001W, was operated from 1981 to 1998), the European\nIncoherent Scatter (EISCAT) Troms\u00f8 site, Norway\n(69.59\u0001N, 19.23\u0001E), the Space Plasma Exploration by\nActive Radar (SPEAR) at Svalbard, Norway (78.15\u0001N,\n16.05\u0001E), HF Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP)\nin Gakona, Alaska (62.39\u0001N, 145.15\u0001W), the High Power\nAuroral Stimulation (HIPAS) observatory near Fairbanks,\nAlaska (64.87\u0001N, 146.84\u0001W), the Sura facility near\nVasil\u2019sursk, Russia (56.13\u0001N, 46.10\u0001E), Kharkov observa-\ntory, Ukraine, Russia (50.00\u0001N, 36.2\u0001E), and the Platteville,\nColorado observatory (operated from 1970 to 1981,\n40.18\u0001N, 104.73\u0001W). Of these facilities, four are polar\nfacilities (HAARP, EISCAT Troms\u00f8 and Svalbard, and\nHIPAS), and the remaining four are classified as midlatitude\nfacilities. Only three have powerful incoherent scatter (IS)\nradars for supporting diagnostic measurements: Arecibo\nobservatory, Troms\u00f8 and Svalbard EISCAT sites. The Are-\ncibo radar operates at a center frequency of 430 MHz, and\nthe two EISCAT IS radars at Troms\u00f8 operate at frequencies\nnear 224 MHz and 931 MHz, and 500 MHz at Svalbard.\n[3] Recently, an ultrahigh frequency (UHF) diagnostic\nradar was added to HAARP; it is located \u00012 km from the\nHF antenna array. This radar is tuned to a center frequency\nof 446 MHz and therefore diagnoses the ionospheric plasma\nat a wave number similar to that of Arecibo observatory.\nThe radar is a development version of the Advanced\nModular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) that has been\ndeveloped by the National Science Foundation and SRI\nInternational for incoherent scatter observations at other\nlocations. The first ionospheric modification observations\nmade with the HAARP UHF radar took place between 3\nand 5 February 2005 and are the subject of the study\ndescribed herein. During these experiments an eight-panel\nconfiguration was employed, which yielded a peak power of\n256 kW, an effective antenna aperture of 109.9 m2, and the\nsystem temperature of 120 K. The antenna phased array was\nplaced in the horizontal plane, and yielded a \u00014.3\u0001 for 3 dB\nhalf-width one-way beamwidth of the vertical beam. The\nradar beam can be steered to a maximum zenith angle of\n\u000130\u0001 without significantly decreasing antenna gain or\ngreatly increasing the beamwidth. HAARP\u2019s location makes\nit possible to point the radar beam parallel to the geomag-\nnetic field in the F region. The required geographic beam\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, A06309, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011363, 2006\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks,\nAlaska, USA.\n2Geospace Research, Inc., El Segundo, California, USA.\n3Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK.\n4Honorary Research Fellow, University of Kwazulu-Natal, Durban,\nSouth Africa.\n5Plasma Physics Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC,\nUSA.\n6SRI International, Menlo Park, California, USA.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2005JA011363$09.00\nA06309 1 of 11\npointing coordinates are 15\u0001 zenith angle and 204\u0001 azimuth.\nThus the HAARP UHF radar operates at a frequency close\nto the Arecibo IS radar, but the geomagnetic observing\ngeometry is similar to that of EISCAT.\n[4] Many HF ionospheric modification experiments have\nbeen conducted at EISCAT [Hagfors et al., 1983; Stubbe et\nal., 1985; Djuth et al., 1994; Isham et al., 1999; Rietveld et\nal., 2000] and Arecibo [Showen and Kim, 1978; Duncan\nand Sheerin, 1985; Djuth et al., 1986; Cheung et al., 1989;\nDjuth et al., 1990; Cheung et al., 1992; Isham and Hagfors,\n1993]. The radars observed enhanced ion and plasma lines\nthat originated from an altitude where HF pump waves\ncaused local changes in the plasma density and temperature\nas well as plasma-wave turbulence. Important experimental\ninformation is provided from spectrum analysis of the radar\nbackscatter from the ionosphere modified by artificially\ninduced electromagnetic waves.\n[5] Many of the spectral features of Langmuir turbulence\nexcited by HF pump waves were initially interpreted in\nterms of the parametric decay instability (PDI) and the\noscillating two-stream instability (OTSI) [e.g., Fejer and\nKuo, 1973; Perkins et al., 1974]. This theory employs a\nweak turbulence approximation to the Zakharov model\nequations. However, altitude-averaged enhanced plasma\nline spectra detected with an IS radar exhibit two features\nthat cannot be readily explained with this approximation.\nThe first is a broad spectral component that starts at the\ndecay line and rapidly decreases with frequency over a\nfrequency interval of 30\u2013100 kHz in the direction of fradar,\nwhere fradar is the radar frequency [e.g., Kantor, 1974;\nCarlson and Duncan, 1977; Showen and Kim, 1978; Djuth,\n1984; Djuth et al., 1986; Stubbe et al., 1992; Kohl et al.,\n1993]. The second feature is a weak displaced peak first\nnoted by Djuth et al. [1986] in the band fradar \u00b1 (fHF + D),\nwhere fHF is the HF pump frequency, and D = 10\u2013100 kHz.\nOther observations showed similar results [Cheung et al.,\n1989; Cheung et al., 1992; Kohl et al., 1993]. In addition, in\nmany observations the radar echo appeared to originate near\nthe point of HF reflection, which is inconsistent with theory\nbased on the weak turbulence approximation [e.g., Muldrew\nand Showen, 1977; Birkmayer et al., 1986; Isham et al.,\n1987; Fejer et al., 1991; Isham and Hagfors, 1993; Sulzer\nand Fejer, 1994]. Strong Langmuir turbulence (SLT) theory\nprovides the much needed new paradigm for the interpre-\ntation of the results. Density cavities referred to as solitons\nwere found to occur near the point of HF reflection in the\npioneering work of Petviashvilli [1976], Weatherall et al.\n[1982], Sheerin et al. [1982], Nicholson et al. [1984], and\nPayne et al. [1984]. This was followed by a series of\ntheoretical studies focused on localized plasma states con-\nsisting of Langmuir oscillations trapped in a self-consistent\ndensity cavity. These entities were termed cavitons [Russell\net al., 1988; DuBois et al., 1988; DuBois et al., 1990]. The\nbroad HF pump-induced plasma line (HFPL) spectrum and\nthe displaced peak discussed above are readily interpreted\nwithin the context of the caviton model [e.g., Cheung et al.,\n1989; DuBois et al., 1990; Cheung et al., 1992; Hanssen et\nal., 1992; DuBois et al., 1993a, 1993b; DuBois et al.,\n1995a, 1995b; DuBois et al., 2001]. The broad spectrum\nis the result of the collapse of localized states, which skew\nspectral components to frequencies less than fHF, and the\ndisplaced spectral feature is the \u2019\u2019free mode,\u2019\u2019 which is a\nfreely propagating Langmuir wave. Both features occur at\nand below the critical layer. However, only the free mode\nfollows dispersion relation for Langmuir waves in a mag-\nnetized plasma: wL\n2(ks, z) = wpe\n2 (z) + 3ks\n2Ve\n2 + wce\n2 sin2 q\n[DuBois et al., 1993a], where ks \u0002 2kradar, kradar is magni-\ntude of the radar wave vector kradar, Ve is thermal velocity of\nelectrons, wpe and wce are the electron plasma frequency and\nelectron cyclotron frequencies, respectively, and q is the\nangle between kradar and the geomagnetic field. Altitude\nresolved HFPL and ion line spectra [Fejer et al., 1991;\nSulzer and Fejer, 1994; Stubbe, 1996b; Kohl and Rieveld,\n1996; Isham et al., 1999; Rietveld et al., 2000; Cheung et\nal., 2001; Djuth et al., 2004] have shown remarkable\nsimilarity to the predictions of DuBois et al. [1993a,\n1993b, 2001].\n[6] The SLT theory is based on an extension of Zakhar-\nov\u2019s model [Zakharov, 1972; DuBois et al., 1993a], which\ndescribes coupling of high-frequency Langmuir waves with\nlow-frequency ion density fluctuations driven by artificially\ninduced electromagnetic waves. The ponderomotive force\nof Langmuir waves generates cavitons within a several\nhundred meters of the O-mode reflection height where the\nHF frequency is equal to the local plasma frequency.\nBroadband Langmuir oscillations are generated by Lang-\nmuir collapse events along with narrow-banded freely\npropagating Langmuir modes. Parametric decay cascades\ndevelop at lower heights where wave number and frequency\nmatching conditions are satisfied. The propagation of both\nthe free mode cascade waves is determined by the Langmuir\ndispersion relation.\n[7] HF pump-induced plasma lines observed with the\nIS radar contain several sharp peaks at a displacement\nof \u00b1fHF from fradar and at offsets of n = 1, 3, 5 . . . times\nthe ion-acoustic frequency, fia, from fradar \u00b1 fHF, that is\nfradar \u00b1 (fHF \u0003 nfia). The ion-acoustic frequency is dependent\non the plasma temperature [Isham and Hagfors, 1993,\nequation (1)]. The former peak is known as the purely\ngrowing mode, which is due to the OTSI [Kantor, 1974;\nCarlson and Duncan, 1977; Walker, 1979; Nicholson et al.,\n1984; Sprague and Fejer, 1995; Stubbe, 1996a]. The latter\npeaks with the frequency offset of fia and nfia are known as\nthe decay and the cascade lines, respectively.\n[8] The focus of this paper is on persistent enhancements\nof the plasma line during HF on at several HF pump\nfrequencies. Section 2 below outlines operational modes\nof the UHF diagnostic radar and the HAARP. Three\nexamples of the persistent plasma line are presented in\nsection 3. Section 4 discusses ionospheric conditions when\nthe persistent plasma line appears.\n2. Experimental Details\n[9] The HAARP HF transmitter system was operated\nfrom 3 to 5 February 2005 in various modes with O- and\nX-mode polarizations, directed toward the local geomag-\nnetic field line at HAARP (azimuth: 204\u0001, elevation: 75\u0001) at\nseveral frequencies as shown in Table 1. The present paper\nreports only about data obtained for selected intervals when\npersistent enhancements of the UHF diagnostic radar back-\nscatter were observed. The pump duty cycle was also\ntabulated in Table 1.\nA06309 OYAMA ET AL.: HF PUMP-INDUCED PERSISTENT PLASMA LINE\n2 of 11\nA06309\n[10] The UHF diagnostic radar beam was directed along\nthe geomagnetic field line during all experiments discussed\nin this paper. It operated at a frequency of 446 MHz with a\n998-ms uncoded transmitter pulse and 100-kHz sampling\nrate. An interpulse period (IPP) of 10 ms was used. This\ndiagnostic radar had only one receiver to measure one of the\nup-shifted or down-shifted plasma lines.\n[11] The ionosonde at HAARP was used to estimate foF2\nand other ionospheric parameters every 2 or 5 min. The\nfoF2 data were used in real time to determine optimum HF\nfrequencies.\n3. Experimental Results\n3.1. Case Study on 3 February 2005\n[12] Figure 1 shows color-coded time-frequency profile\nof power spectral density (PSD) of the down-shifted plasma\nline measured with the UHF diagnostic radar from 0201 to\n0211 UT on 3 February 2005. The figure uses data inte-\ngrated for 2 s. The thick white lines show the HF on periods,\nwhich incrementally increase by 5 s each until 0210 UT,\nwhen a new pumping cycle begins. The diagnostic radar\nwas not operated during the initial 5-s on period because of\ntechnical troubles, which delayed starting the measurement.\nThe data showed strongly enhanced signal returns just after\nthe HF pump wave was turned on. This enhanced power is\nfrequently termed as \u2018\u2018overshoot.\u2019\u2019 For the remainder of\ninterval when the HF pump wave was on, there was a\nweaker persistent enhancement.\n[13] When the plasma line overshoot was observed dur-\ning HF on period, at least three cascade lines were devel-\noped together with the decay line in association with HF\nturn-on. The cascade lines appeared at near odd multiplies\nof the ion-acoustic frequency, which is about 4 kHz. The\npersistent plasma line appeared for all periods from begin-\nning of the diagnostic radar operation at 0201 UT to\n0208 UT, although the persistent plasma line induced at\n0207 UT gradually became weak during HF on period.\nPersistent enhancements of the plasma line were not clearly\nseen after 0209 UT. Since the operational mode of the HF\ntransmitter system was not changed for this experiment\nexcept for duration of the HF on\/off period, some iono-\nspheric conditions might change around 0208 UT.

Values of foF2 were obtained every 5 min except\nat 0205 UT. The upper panel of Figure 2 shows that foF2\nfrom 0200 to 0240 UT decreased with time from 4.35 to\n3.90 MHz. The HF pump frequency of 4.1 MHz at 0200 UT\nwas slightly lower than foF2, and that at 0210 UTwas equal\nto foF2. These frequency differences imply that the HF\npump frequency was slightly lower than foF2 by a few\nhundred kHz when persistent enhancements of the plasma\nline were observed from 0201 to 0208 UT. When there were\nno persistent plasma line enhancements, the HF pump\nfrequency was approximately equal to or higher than\nfoF2. The height-averaged signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of\nradar backscatter power had a minimum value in a few\nseconds after HF turn-on when persistent plasma line\nenhancements were observed, and then increased to about\n\u00039 dB keeping this level until HF turn-off.\n[14] While the UHF diagnostic radar was fixed to look\nalong the geomagnetic field line for these experiments, the\nionosonde obtained most of its data from a wide beam\ndirected vertically. To compare data from two radio instru-\nments, we need to assume the ionospheric homogeneity in\ntwo different positions as discussed in section 4.\n3.2. Case Study on 4 February 2005\n[15] Figure 3 shows color-coded time-frequency profile\nof PSD of the upshifted plasma line from 0317 to 0339 UT\non 4 February 2005. The figure is plotted using data\nintegrated for 2 s. The HF pump frequency during this time\ninterval was 2.85 MHz. Persistent plasma line enhance-\nments were seen clearly during O-mode transmissions,\nexcept for 0337 to 0338 UT. No plasma lines were seen\nduring X-mode pumping. The purely growing mode can be\nclearly seen at 2.85 MHz, and the decay and the first\ncascade lines are also clearly identified. Persistent plasma\nlines contained broad peaks from 2.84 to 2.85 MHz. The\nbroad peaks were not seen in the persistent plasma line of\n3 February. Figure 4 shows temporal variations in foF2\nmeasured with the ionosonde and height-averaged SNR of\nthe diagnostic-radar backscatter power for the 4 February\n2005 case. Enhancements of the plasma line did not persist\nafter 0336 UT as shown in Figure 4. The operational mode\nof the diagnostic radar was switched from the upshifted\nplasma line measurement to the downshifted one at\n0340 UT. Persistent plasma line enhancements were not\nclearly seen after the fortuitous measurement switch; but we\nthink that the mode change is not the significant reason to\nstop the persistent enhancement. This is because the pulse\nbeginning at 0337 UT did not show persistent enhance-\nments, although the diagnostic radar was still operated in\nthe mode of upshifted plasma line measurement. The\nprincipal reason we consider is the background ionospheric\nchange as shown in Figure 4.\n[16] The upper panel of Figure 4 shows that values of\nfoF2 from 0300 to 0330 UT remained almost constant\naround 3.2 MHz, then decreased to about 2.9 MHz from\n0330 to 0350 UT. After 0350 UT, values of foF2 were lower\nFigure 2.

While persistent plasma\nline enhancements were seen from 0135 to 0138 UT when\nthe HF pump frequency was slightly lower than foF2 by a\nfew hundred kHz, persistent enhancements were not seen\nfor other time periods. This result also suggests the identical\ncharacteristic about the relationship between foF2 and the\nHF pump frequency with two other cases mentioned in the\nprevious subsections.\n[19] While the HF pump frequency of 4.5 MHz was lower\nthan foF2 from 0150 to 0210 UT, there was no persistent\nplasma line enhancement. Frequency differences during this\ntime period were in excess of 500 kHz, which is larger than\nthose for other events associated with persistent plasma line\nenhancements (see Figures 2 and 4). This result suggests\nthat there may be a maximum value of the frequency\ndifference to generate persistent plasma line enhancements.\n4. Discussion\n[20] The three examples in this paper suggest that persis-\ntent enhancements of the UHF diagnostic-radar backscatter\nare induced when the HF pump frequency is slightly lower\nthan foF2 by a few hundred kHz. The persistent enhance-\nment is not generated when the HF pump frequency is equal\nto foF2, that is, when the height gradient of the electron\ndensity is zero at the reflection height. The decay line and\nthe cascade line are generated at the so-called matching\nheight [DuBois et al., 1993a], which can be expressed as\nfollowing [Stubbe et al., 1992]:\nza \u00bc z0 \u0003 12V\n2\ne\nc2\nf 2radar\nf 2HF\nH \u00f01\u00de\nwhere z0 is the reflection height, Ve, which is equal toffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nkBTe\n\u0002\nme\ns\n;\nis the thermal velocity of electrons, c is the speed of light,\nand H is the plasma scale height, kB is the Boltzmann\nconstant, Te is the electron temperature, and me is the\nelectron mass. While the matching height for the experi-\nments cannot be determined precisely because the electron\ntemperature is not available, the matching height may be\nlocated below the reflection height by 1.1\u20132.4 km for fHF of\n4.1\u20135.35 MHz and by 3.7\u20135.0 km for fHF of 2.85 MHz if H\nis 50 km and the electron temperature is in the 1500\u20132000\nK level. However, if the reflection height is close to the F2\npeak height, where H is significantly larger than the typical\nvalue (e.g., 50 km), the matching height may be too far from\nthe reflection height, and the ion-acoustic wave excited by\nPDI essentially damps before reaching the matching height.\nIf this is the case, persistent enhancements of the plasma\nline may not be measured. These experimental results\nsuggest that the persistent backscatter enhancement needs\noptimum height gradients in the ionospheric density or the\nplasma scale height around the matching height.\n[21] Striations artificially induced by electromagnetic\nwaves are local stationary depletions of the plasma density\nwith scale of the order of a few meters across and several\nkilometers along the geomagnetic field line in the upper\nhybrid resonance region where a few kilometer below the\nHF pump wave reflection altitude. Field-aligned striations\n(FAS) of sufficient amplitudes can modify the refractive\nindex of an O-mode wave in the vicinity of the upper-hybrid\nresonance [Robinson, 2002]. The scattering of electromag-\nnetic waves into electrostatic waves at the upper-hybrid\nresonance altitude causes anomalous absorption, which can\nbe suppressed when the HF pump frequency is close to (or\nat) electron gyroharmonics equal to or larger than 3 [Stocker\net al., 1993; Stubbe et al., 1994; Honary et al., 1995, 1999;\nRobinson et al., 1996; Kosch et al., 2002]. In this case,\nduring the entire duration of the HF transmitted pulse, these\nHF pump waves reach the matching height, where coupling\nto Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves takes place. These\nprevious studies suggest that electron gyroharmonics are\nimportant to understand causality between the persistent\nplasma line enhancement and the modified ionospheric\ncondition. In practice, persistent enhancements of the ion\nand plasma lines have been measured with the IS radar\n[Isham et al., 1987; Isham and Hagfors, 1993; Djuth et al.,\n1994; Honary et al., 1999; Dhillon and Robinson, 2005]. It\nis, however, noted that some papers suggest high absorption\nfor the second gyroharmonic [Djuth et al., 2005; Kosch et\nal., 2005]. In this case anomalous absorption at the upper\nhybrid resonance greatly increases, and Bernstein modes\nbecome trapped in field-aligned irregularities then the short-\nscale irregularities are strongly excited [e.g., Fialer, 1974].\nWhile the HF pump-induced plasma line should be much\nsmaller, this scenario was in sharp contrast to results on 4\nFebruary. Next section addresses the electron gyrohar-\nmonics when the persistent plasma line enhancements were\nobserved.\n4.1. Effects of the Electron Gyroharmonics\n[22] The electron gyrofrequency is a function of magni-\ntude of the geomagnetic field as the equation is given by\nfgyro \u00bc Be\n2pme\n; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere B is the geomagnetic field magnitude, and e is the\ncharge of an electron. To estimate B, model results from the\nIGRF (International Geomagnetic Reference Field) are used\nin this paper thus fgyro is strongly dependent on the model\nresults, although the geomagnetic field can fluctuate in\nassociation with geomagnetic activity by order of 100 nT.\nUncertainty of the local plasma frequency and the electron\ngyrofrequency is the important issue when investigating the\nelectron gyroharmonics at the reflection height. Electron-\ngyrofrequency uncertainty due to geomagnetic-field fluc-\ntuations caused by ionospheric currents is addressed in this\nsection. Uncertainty of the local plasma frequency from the\nionosonde due to horizontal ionospheric inhomogeneity in\nthe vicinity of the solar terminator is addressed in the next\nsection.\n[23] Geomagnetic field variations that cause electron\ngyrofrequency uncertainties of 50 and 10 kHz are 1786\nand 357 nT, respectively, from equation (2) assuming that\nA06309 OYAMA ET AL.: HF PUMP-INDUCED PERSISTENT PLASMA LINE\n7 of 11\nA06309\nhorizontal ionospheric currents are distributed at 100 km\nheight and the reflection height is 200 km. This calculation\nsuggests that the uncertainty is less than 10 kHz according\nto magnetometer data during the experiments (not shown\nhere). Uncertainty of the ionosonde data may be \u00b12 km in\nheight corresponding to about 3 kHz. These values should\nbe remembered when discussing the gyroharmonics below.\n[24] Figures 7, 8, and 9 show height profiles of the local\nplasma (solid curve) and the upper-hybrid (dotted curve)\nfrequencies calculated using data from the ionosonde\naround time periods when persistent enhancements of the\nbackscatter were observed. The HF pump frequency and the\nelectron gyroharmonic frequency (dashed line) are also\nillustrated.\n[25] Electron gyroharmonics for the case of 3 February in\nFigure 7 are different from those for the other two cases. For\nthe case of 3 February, when persistent enhancements of the\nbackscatter were measured, the local plasma frequency at\nthe reflection height deviates clearly from the third electron\ngyroharmonic frequency comparing with the uncertainty\nestimated above; by contrast for the other two cases, the\nlocal plasma frequency at the reflection height is close to\nthe second or third electron gyroharmonic frequencies. The\nlatter two cases can be explained with the physical process\nof the previous studies as mentioned in the second\nparagraph of section 4, but the process is not appropriate\nfor the case of 3 February. Since the pump frequency is\n500 kHz or more below foF2 and is not equal to fgyro in the\ncase of Figure 9 at 0150 UT, either argument could be the\nreason for the lack of persistent enhancement. The results\nsuggest that the physical process is not perfect yet to explain\nthe persistent backscatter enhancement, at least for results in\nthe present paper.\n4.2. Ionospheric Inhomogeneity During the\nExperiments\n[26] While plasma lines are analyzed using data from\ngeomagnetic field-aligned measurements of the UHF diag-\nnostic radar, the ionosonde obtains most of its data from a\nFigure 7. Height profile of the local plasma frequency estimated with the HAARP ionosonde\n(solid curve), the upper hybrid frequency (dotted curve), and the third harmonic electron gyrofrequency\n(dashed line) from 0200 to 0220 UT on 3 February 2005. The vertical solid line shows the HF pump\nfrequency of 4.1 MHz. Persistent enhancements of the radar backscatter power were measured at time\nwith underline.\nA06309 OYAMA ET AL.: HF PUMP-INDUCED PERSISTENT PLASMA LINE\n8 of 11\nA06309\nwide beam directed vertically. Since the experiments were\nconducted at dusk, the ionospheric density might have\nhorizontal gradients, and therefore the ionospheric density\nalong the geomagnetic field line might be different from that\nat the zenith. In this section effects of the horizontal iono-\nspheric inhomogeneity in the vicinity of the solar terminator\non the ionospheric density are addressed.\n[27] The horizontal distance between the zenith and the\ngeomagnetic field line is about 60 km at 220 km height.\nDifference in the solar zenith angle c due to the 60-km\ndistance is about 0.57\u0001. The ionization rate is proportional\nto exp(\u00031\/cos c), and differences in the ionization rate due\nto angle of 0.57\u0001 are negligibly small except when the solar\nzenith angle is 89.43\u0001 (=90\u0001\u20130.57\u0001), that is, just before the\nsunset. Since electron density variations in the F region due\nto ionization and recombination while the solar terminator\npasses between two positions in the F region are signifi-\ncantly smaller than background electron density, iono-\nspheric inhomogeneity caused by the tilted solar radiation\nin the vicinity of the solar terminator is not important.\nTherefore the assumption of ionospheric homogeneity be-\ntween the zenith and the geomagnetic field line from\nHAARP is considered to be acceptable for the phenomena\nfeatured in this paper.\n5. Summary and Conclusions\n[28] This paper presents data from the first experimental\ncampaign with the UHF diagnostic radar at HAARP. HF\npump-induced plasma lines were observed with the UHF\ndiagnostic radar. This paper focuses on persistent enhance-\nments of the radar backscatter power during HF on, and\npresents three cases obtained on 3, 4, and 5 February 2005.\nAll case studies show that persistent enhancements of the\nradar backscatter power are induced when the HF pump\nfrequency is slightly lower than foF2 by a few hundred kHz\nat the reflection height. The comparison studies suggest that\nthe persistent enhancement may be related to the electron-\ndensity height-gradient at the O-mode reflection height. On\nthe other hand, the persistent enhancement does not appear\nwhen the HF pump frequency is equal to and higher than\nFigure 8. The format is the same as Figure 7 but for height profiles from 0330 to 0342 UT on\n4 February 2005. The vertical solid and the dashed lines show the HF pump frequency of 2.85 MHz and\nthe second harmonic electron gyrofrequency, respectively.\nA06309 OYAMA ET AL.: HF PUMP-INDUCED PERSISTENT PLASMA LINE\n9 of 11\nA06309\nfoF2 at the reflection height or lower than foF2 by more\nthan 500 kHz.\n[29] Persistent enhancements measured on 4 and 5 Feb-\nruary 2005 appeared when the HF pump frequency was\nclose to the second or third electron gyroharmonic frequen-\ncies at the reflection height. This result is consistent with\nprevious studies on coupling to Langmuir and ion-acoustic\nwaves in the vicinity of the reflection height, and suggests\nthat electron gyroharmonics play an important role in\ngenerating the persistent radar backscatter power [Stocker\net al., 1993; Stubbe et al., 1994; Honary et al., 1995, 1999;\nRobinson et al., 1996; Kosch et al., 2002]. Persistent\nenhancements measured on 3 February 2005, however,\nshow that the local plasma frequency at the reflection height\nis significantly different from the third electron gyrohar-\nmonic frequency, and this result is inconsistent with the\ntheoretical prediction.\n[30] Acknowledgments.
