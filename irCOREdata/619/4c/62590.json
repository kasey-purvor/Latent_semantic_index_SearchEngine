The impacts of \ncontaminated sites in the UK and internationally are managed using a conceptual risk based assessment \nmodel: \n \nSource \uf05f Pathway \uf05f Receptor \n \nThe source is defined by the amount and nature of a potentially hazardous contaminant.  The degree to \nwhich a source poses a risk depends on the presence of a means of transport (the pathway) for the \ncontaminants to the receptor (the plants, animals and\/or humans and even buildings that may be adversely \naffected by the contamination).  Contaminants can move from the source to the receptor via food, soil, air \nand water.  For humans, the main ways that contaminants can enter our bodies are by ingestion, inhalation \nand direct contact, for example, by absorption through the skin.  \n \nIt is important to note that groundwater and surface water may act both as pathways (e.g. through \npercolation through the unsaturated zone, saturated groundwater flow and surface water flow) and \nreceptors (e.g. vulnerable water abstractions, resources or ecological systems).  Evaluation of surface and \ngroundwaters as part of contaminated site investigation studies is, therefore, a major concern.   \n \nThis paper aims to provide a step by step guide for practitioners involved in the collection of contaminated \nsamples by reviewing current groundwater sampling techniques and procedures and highlighting the major \nsources of uncertainty associated with sample collection.  On-site water quality measurements, quality \nassurance procedures and sample handling techniques designed to maintain the representativeness of the \nsample from field to laboratory are also discussed.. \n \nGROUNDWATER SAMPLING OBJECTIVES  \nThe critical objective of groundwater sampling for site characterisation is to collect representative samples \nand to ensure that their integrity is maintained from field to laboratory.  Sampling and analysis can be \nexpensive so it is important that a thorough understanding of the site conditions is determined prior to \nmobilising a field sampling team.  For example, groundwater quality can be variable over quite short \ndistances; therefore, an understanding of the hydrogeology and flow dynamics of a system is important \nbefore any water quality sampling is undertaken.  Preparing a robust conceptual model of the site in \nadvance will help to guide the type of sample, analysis and sampling protocol required.   \n \nPlanning and Preparation  \nA successful groundwater sampling campaign needs to be planned meticulously prior to mobilisation of the \nsampling team.  It is important to ensure that all paperwork and relevant information is available to the \nteam.  This will include: maps of the site detailing borehole locations; borehole details, including purge \nvolumes and completion details; analytical requirements, including bottle types, preservation techniques \nand on-site measurement requirements; sample sheets and bottle labels; contact details for site supervisors, \nlaboratories, couriers, etc; data from previous sampling rounds for comparison; and health and safety \ndocumentation read and signed by all field operatives. \n \nCHOOSING THE RIGHT PORTABLE SAMPLING DEVICES   \nThere are a variety of portable sampling devices available for the collection of representative groundwater \nsamples, however, each application has different requirements and is dependant on the contaminant(s) of \ninterest and, most importantly, the specification of the borehole to be sampled.  The first factors to consider \nare the depth to the water table and the borehole diameter; other factors including the borehole completion \n(e.g. open hole, length of screened interval, casing diameter, purge volume required) also need to be \nconsidered.  In addition, the sampling device should satisfy the following requirements (Schuller et al., \n1981): \n\uf0b7 the device must not alter the physical or chemical structure of the sample; \n\uf0b7 the materials used in the construction of the device must not leach or absorb contaminants to or from the \nsample; \n\uf0b7 the device must be portable and easy to mend in the field; \n\uf0b7 the device must be easily cleaned to avoid cross-contamination; \n\uf0b7 chemical parameters such as pH, ORP (oxidation-reduction potential) dissolved oxygen and \ntemperature must not be altered by the pumping mechanism; \n\uf0b7 the device should be inexpensive, durable and simple to use. \n \nComparisons of the different sampling mechanisms available are given by Barcelona et al. (1984), Stuart \n(1984), Nielsen and Yeates (1985) and Pohlmann and Hess (1988).  A comprehensive literature review of \nthe effects of sampling devices on water quality is given by Parker (1994). \n \nPortable sampling devices were categorised by Nielsen and Yeates (1985) as: grab samplers, suction lift \ndevices and positive displacement mechanisms.  A brief review of each category is given below. \nGrab Samplers \nThe most common grab sampler is the bailer, of which there are several types available.  Essentially, the \nbailer is a rigid tube made of PVC, stainless steel or Teflon, with a ball valve at the bottom and an open top.  \nAs the bailer is lowered to the required depth, groundwater flows up through the ball valve and out through \nthe open top.  Once the bailer is no longer in motion, the pressure of the water column closes the ball valve \nand seals in the sample.  Double valve bailers have valves top and bottom that are both closed upon \nreaching the required depth; this stops inflow and mixing of water during the bailer\u2019s ascent to the surface.  \nBailers are generally inexpensive (stainless steel bailers are the exception) and fulfil most of Nielsen and \nYeats\u2019 criteria for the \u2018ideal\u2019 sampling tool.  They can be dedicated to individual monitoring wells to avoid \ncross contamination between boreholes, they are portable, simple to use and relatively easy to clean.  They \nare, however, not suitable for purging large volumes of water, and it can be difficult even with double \nended bailers to determine accurately where the sample was collected.  Compared to other sampling \ndevices, the operator is also more at risk of coming into contact with contaminated sample, especially when \nemptying the bailer. \n \nPassive diffusion bag sampler (PDB) \nPassive Diffusion Bag (PDB) sampling takes advantage of the Fick\u2019s Law of Diffusion, which states that \ncompounds will migrate from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until \nequilibrium is achieved.  A typical PDB sampler consists of a low-density polyethylene, \u2018lay-flat\u2019 tube \nclosed at both ends and filled with deionised water prior to deployment.  The sampler is positioned at the \ntarget horizon of the well by attachment to a weighted line or fixed pipe.  The sampler is used to obtain \nconcentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater from wells or at interfaces of \ngroundwater and surface water.  The molecular size and shape and hydrophobic nature of a compound \ninfluences its ability to diffuse through the polyethylene membrane and thus PDB samplers are not \nappropriate for all VOCs.  PDBs are not suitable for assessment of inorganic species. \n \nSnapSamplerTM \nThe SnapSampler\uf0e4 relies on passive flow-through of water through well screens.  It is simple to use and \nthere is minimal field pre-preparation.  The sample bottles are open at both ends to the well environment \nduring the deployment period and contaminants do not have to diffuse through a membrane.  Less \nequilibration time is needed before sampler retrieval and contaminants such as MTBE, 1,2,4-\ntrimethylbenzene, and acetone are not selectively inhibited from entering the sampler.  The no-pour aspect \nof the device is unique among common sampling protocols, whether traditional purge or passive.  Historic \nand recent research on VOC sampling techniques indicates that minimising sample transfer steps also \nminimises VOC losses.  This method eliminates all transfer steps outside the laboratory analytical \nequipment.  There are currently no published studies that have evaluated this device. \nFigure 1 Stainless steel bailer being deployed down a 50 mm monitoring well \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHydraSleeveTM \nThe reported advantages of the HydraSleeveTM are similar to the PDB.  Sladky and Roberts (2002) tested \nthe HydraSleveTM for its applicability to sample semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) by comparison \nwith low-flow purging and bottom-loading bailer samplers.  Results showed that wells containing LNAPLs \nwere not suited to be sampled using this method and that SVOC concentrations were on average 17% \nhigher than low-flow samples and 150% higher than samples collected using a bottom loading bailer.  \nParker and Clark (2002) compared the HydraSleveTM to four other discrete interval samplers and found it \nyielded representative samples of pesticides, explosives and metals, although the authors recommend that it \nbe used only in low turbidity wells. \nInertial Pumps \nThe inertial pump is described for use in groundwater monitoring wells by Rannie and Nadon (1988).  The \npump consists of just two components: a foot valve, which can be manufactured in High Density \nPolyethylene (HDPE), Delrin (an acetal resin thermoplastic that has high strength, rigidity, durability and \nchemical resistance), Teflon or stainless steel; and a riser tube, also made from HDPE or Teflon.  The \noperating principle of the pump is based on the inertia of a column of water within the riser tubing.  Once \ninstalled, the water level in the tubing is equal to that of the well.  A rapid upstroke closes the foot valve \nand lifts the water column in the tubing a distance equal to the stroke length.  The water column continues \nto move up the riser tubing due to its inertia.  A down stroke opens the foot valve, forcing water to flow \ninto the tubing thus raising the water level.  Rapid up and down movement of the tubing causes the water to \nrise up the tubing to the surface.  Flow rates of between 1.8 and 6.5 litres per minute were reported \ndepending on the foot valve size, and depths of 40 m (manual operation) and 60 m (motor driven) were \nachieved.  As with bailers, this device fulfils most of the requirements of the \u2018ideal\u2019 sampling device as \ndescribed above, however, manual operation is labour intensive and the use of a motorised device requires \na compressor or generator, thus reducing the portability of the system. \n \nPeristaltic pumps \nSuction lift pumps operate by applying a vacuum to a sample line or tube causing water to be drawn up to \nthe surface.  This limits these devices to sampling groundwaters at depths no greater than 7.6 m (Nielsen \nand Yeates, 1985).  Peristaltic pumps operate by creating a low vacuum by the squeezing action of rollers \non flexible tubing, as the rollers rotate around the tubing, suction is created drawing sample up from the \nwell.  These pumps have an advantage over centrifugal pumps (see below) in that the sample only comes \ninto contact with the tubing.  However, silicone tubing is most commonly used, to provide the required \nflexibility, and this is not suitable for sampling organics due to its propensity to absorb organic compounds \n(Barcelona et al., 1985; Pearsall and Eckhardt (1987).  The loss of volatiles using peristaltic pumps has \nbeen investigated by a number of workers; Barker and Dickhout (1988) found concentrations of volatile \nhalocarbons 23 to 33 percent lower than other pumps tested and concluded that degassing was a problem \nwith this pump.  Both pumps require a power source such as a generator or 12 V batteries. \n \nGas-Operated Bladder Pumps \nThere are several designs of bladder pumps, however, the basic design is one of a long rigid casing (often \nstainless steel) housing a flexible membrane.  The bladder, which has a perforated tube inside, is attached \nto a screened intake check valve and a discharge valve attached to a discharge tube to take sample to the \nsurface.  The annulus between the bladder and the housing is pressurised prior to insertion in the well \ncausing the bladder to collapse.  When a sample is to be taken, the annulus pressure is reduced, as the water \npressure at the intake valve exceeds that of the annulus, and water flows into the bladder through the \nperforated tube.  When the bladder is full, pressure is increased in the annulus causing the bladder to \ncollapse, closing the intake valve and forcing the water up through the discharge valve and into the \ndischarge tube.  The annular gas is then vented to the surface allowing the bladder to be re-filled and the \ncycle repeated.  Regulating the frequency of the applied and released pressure allows the operator to adjust \nthe flow rate and maintain a steady flow.   \n \nBladder pumps are regarded in the literature as one of the best groundwater sampling devices for a number \nof reasons: compressed air is used as the driving gas since it does not come into contact with the sample; \nalmost the entire assembly can be made of inert material; depths in excess of 60 m can be sampled and \nmany bladder pumps are designed to sample 50 mm wells; ease of disassembly allows cleaning and repair \nin the field; variable pumping rates are possible, allowing well purging and low flow rate sampling (Nielsen \nand Yeates (1985)).  However, these pumps are often expensive, the need for an air compressor or \ncompressed air tanks and a pump control make these pumps less portable than others and waters with high \nsuspended solids may block the check valves necessitating removal of the pump.  In addition, lifting \nsample from deep wells requires large amounts of gas. \n \nElectric submersible pumps \nThese pumps consist of a sealed electric motor that drives a two-stage centrifugal pump with radial \nimpellers.  A partial vacuum is created as the impeller rotates and forces water up a discharge line by \ncentrifugal force, water is then drawn into the impeller housing continuing the pumping action.  A screened \nintake inhibits large particles from entering and blocking the pump and a built in thermal switch turns off \nthe pump if a maximum operating temperature is exceeded.  The most commonly used pump of this type is \nthe Grundfos MP1, which is designed to be used in two inch diameter wells or greater.  This pump is \npowered by a 220 V generator and run via an adjustable frequency converter that allows a high range speed \nadjustment of the pump.  High flow rate sampling with pumps such as this has been shown to mobilise \nmore colloidal particles than bladder pumps, thus increasing sample turbidity (Puls et al., 1992).  Puls also \ndraws attention to the disturbance caused to the water column from the insertion and removal of these \npumps and recommends the use of dedicated samplers in each borehole. \n \nRosen et al. (1992) compared downhole sampling using  a helical rotor type of centrifugal pump with  an \nabsorption cartridge for volatile organic compounds  They found that this method of bringing water to the \nsurface could be reliable in many circumstances but that care was needed with adsorption, cross \ncontamination and out gassing. \n \nSubmersible centrifugal pumps are now available with integral packers that allow the screened interval of \nthe well to be isolated from the stagnant column above, thus negating purging requirements and reducing \nsampling times and costs. \n \nCommon materials used in sampling devices \nIt is important that the equipment used for sample collection and the subsequent handling and storage of \nsamples doesn\u2019t contribute to the contaminant load of the sample for example, by leaching organics.  The \nfollowing are common materials used in sampling equipment construction (after Canter et al., 1990): \n\uf0a7 Teflon \u2013 advantages include: it is inert, has poor sorptive qualities and low leaching potential and \ncan be rigid or flexible; disadvantages include: cost  \n\uf0a7 Stainless steel \u2013 easy to clean but expensive \n\uf0a7 PVC \u2013 good chemical resistance (except chlorinated solvents, ketones, aldehydes) and good for \ninorganics, but may bias some organic compounds \n\uf0a7 High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) \u2013 commonly used in sample containers but can absorb trace \nmetals if the sample is not acidified \n\uf0a7 Glass \u2013 essential for samples with organic contaminants \n \nAVOIDING CROSS-CONTAMINATION \nIf it is impractical to dedicate a sampling device to a single well or disposable samplers are not suitable, it \nis imperative that the sampling device is properly cleaned between deployments to avoid cross-\ncontamination of samples and boreholes.  Decontamination is essential for microbiological, organic and \npesticide sampling and recommended, but not as critical, for major ion analysis.  Use of proprietary \ncleaners is recommended and the operator should clean inside and outside of the sampling device and the \nassociated hose.  All cleaning operations should be undertaken away from boreholes and preferably \nsomewhere where the waste water can drain to a foul sewer.  To verify that no residual contamination \nremains in the sampler, a sample of deionised water should be passed through after the cleaning operation \nand analysed for the contaminants of concern.  Wells that are known to be highly contaminated should have \ndedicated sampling devices installed whenever possible.  At the very least, it is useful to have separate \nsampling devices to differentiate between \u2018background\u2019 and \u2018contaminated\u2019 samples.  Where known, \n\u2018background\u2019 samples and those that are least contaminated should be collected before those that are more \nlikely to be heavily contaminated. \n \nWATER LEVEL MEASUREMENTS \nThe level of the water in a well is measured to provide data for groundwater flow direction calculations and \nto calculate purge volumes required for a particular well.  If a low flow sampling protocol is used, the water \nlevel is also measured during pumping to ensure that there is minimal drawdown of the stagnant water \ncolumn.   \n \nThe static water level (SWL) should be measured before purging, sampling or inserting any other device \ninto the well.  It is also good practice to collect water level measurements from all site wells within a \nreasonably short time, i.e. by measuring all water levels at the start of the day.  This mitigates against \nmeasurements not being comparable to one another due to a heavy rainfall event overnight.  Measurements \nshould always be taken to a permanent reference point, e.g. the casing top.  To minimise cross-\ncontamination, the least contaminated wells should be measured first and the measuring device should be \nthoroughly cleaned before deployment in the next well.  \n \nWater level measurements should be compared to previous data to verify that previously calculated purge \nvolumes remain valid prior to purging and sampling. \n \nThere are level measurement devices (dip meters) available as small as 6.4mm in diameter to fit narrow \ndiameter wells.  In general the tape is marked every millimetre (although smaller diameter tapes are less \nfrequently marked) and come in lengths of 30 m to 600 m.  A high-pitched alarm sounds when water is \nreached and the distance read from the tape.  Dip meters can also be used to measure the total depth of a \nwell and interface meters are available that measure immiscible product levels on top of the water column. \n \nAutomated water level measurement can be achieved by deploying pressure transducers that can be set to \nlog data as frequently as every second if required.  Loggers also record temperature and are able to \ncompensate for altitude, water density, temperature and barometric pressure.  These are routinely used \nwhen undertaking hydraulic tests on a well but are also useful to provide accurate, regular, long-term water \nlevel data and are invaluable for groundwater flow direction calculations. \n \nWELL PURGING TECHNIQUES \nGroundwater samples representative of in-situ conditions are difficult to obtain because of complex \nphysical, chemical, geological and bacterial processes.  Monitoring wells are often completed with screen \nlengths that are shorter than the column of water in the well.  Water sitting above the screened interval is \nliable to stagnation as fresh water is unable to flow in this section of the well.  In order to collect a sample \nthat is representative of the water flowing through the geological formation, it is important to either remove \nthe stagnant water or sample from the screened section of the well at a rate of flow equal to that flowing \nthrough it.  Interaction of air in the well with the top of the column of water can change the chemical \ncomposition of the water.  For example, the dissolved gas content (dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide) of \nthe water will equilibrate with the air column causing oxidation and precipitation of some metals (e.g. iron \nand manganese) out of solution.  Biological activity, interaction with well casing material and material \nfalling into the well will also affect the water quality.  The most common way to mitigate against this is to \nremove the stagnant water prior to collecting the sample. \n \nSpecified number of well volumes \nTraditionally the removal of stagnant water from a monitoring well is accomplished by purging a fixed \nnumber of well volumes, generally between three to five volumes, prior to sample collection.  A well \nvolume is defined as the amount of water in the well casing and screened portion of the well at static water \nlevel conditions and is calculated using the formula: Volume = \uf070 r2 h, where r is the radius of the borehole \nand h the height of the water column.  However, this method does not take into account the annulus \nbetween the well casing and the true diameter of the drilled borehole, which is often backfilled with gravel.  \nThis annulus should also be taken into account when calculating well volumes and is calculated as the \ndrilled borehole diameter minus the well casing volume multiplied by the porosity of the fill material.  \nSubmersible pumps are generally used when purging as high flow rates are required, although inertial \npumps can be used, particularly where smaller purge volumes are required.  One technique is to locate the \npump above the screen so it can be lifted to the top of the water column to remove the stagnant water. \n \nThe 3-5 well volume purge approach has a number of disadvantages: \n \n1. Large volumes of potentially contaminated waste water requiring off-site disposal are often \nproduced. \n2. Turbidity is increased due to the high rate of pumping required to purge large volumes of water in \na reasonable time frame. \n3. Water from different zones in the aquifer is mixed giving an averaged concentration of \ncontaminants in the well.  Zones of interest will not be identified. \n4. Volatile compounds may be lost due to agitation of the sample. \n5. It is relatively easy to pump wells dry mistakenly, allowing aeration of sample that had previously \nexisted in an anaerobic environment. \n \nAnother problem with this approach is the lack of scientific evidence to determine when a sample should be \ncollected.  This can be alleviated by monitoring water quality parameters such as pH, temperature (t), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), oxidation\u2013reduction (or redox) potential (ORP, otherwise referred to as Eh) \nand dissolved oxygen (DO2) throughout the purge to ascertain when the stagnant water has been removed.  \nPlotting the stabilisation times of these parameters can inform the sampler when a sample can be collected.  \nFor subsequent sampling rounds, purge times can be related to parameter stabilisation times, hence \nreducing the purge time required.  Many sampling practitioners use EC as the basis for stabilisation, but \nPuls and Powell (1992) report that pH, t and EC are the least sensitive indicators of aquifer equilibration.  \nRedox potential, DO2 and contaminant concentration were reported to be more sensitive, and turbidity the \nmost sensitive indictor of equilibrated conditions.  Therefore the general order of stabilisation is pH, t, EC, \nEh, DO2 and turbidity and samples should not be collected until at least dissolved oxygen concentration has \nstabilised.  In-line flow cells are recommended to continually monitor these parameters to avoid contact of \nthe sample with the atmosphere.   \n \nA study by Gibbs et al. (1990) found that monitoring field water-quality parameters for stability is not a \nreliable indicator of when to collect a representative sample for purgeable organic compounds (POCs), such \nas chlorinated alkanes, alkenes and aromatics.  For these types of compounds, the researchers suggest direct \nmonitoring of POC concentrations.  \n \nRe-evaluation of sampling techniques in recent years has led to researchers developing a new technique \nthat reduces the amount of purge water by negating the need to remove the stagnant water column in a well.  \nControlled pumping of the well at low flow rates (<500 mL per minute) while monitoring indicator \nparameters to the point of stabilisation has been shown to produce samples comparable with those collected \nusing a full purge technique. \n \nLow-flow purging \nWater flowing through the screened interval of a monitoring well is representative of the formation water \nand chemically distinct from the overlying stagnant column (Robin and Gillham, 1987).  The theory of \nlow-flow purging (sometimes referred to as micropurging) takes advantage of this and aims to minimise the \ndrawdown in a well during pumping by placing the pump across or just above the screened interval and \npumping at a very slow rate.  Low-flow refers to the velocity of the formation water entering the well \nscreen.  Low-flow purging effectively isolates the stagnant column of water as groundwater flows through \nthe well screen at a sufficiently low velocity such that water is only taken from the screened interval thus \nleaving the stagnant water undisturbed. \n \nSignificant research into the flow patterns that occur in monitoring wells has been undertaken over the last \n10-15 years and is summarised here. \n \nObservations of colloidal movement under natural conditions and during pumping were conducted at \nseveral field sites by Kearl et al. (1992).  Results indicated that the installation of dedicated sampling \ndevices, limited purging of the well prior to sampling, sampling at a flow rate of 100 mL per minute, and \nnot filtering samples may collectively improve the representativeness and cost effectiveness of obtaining \ngroundwater samples for assessing the total mobile contaminant load. \n \nPuls and Powell (1992) recommended the use of low-flow rates during both purging and sampling, \nplacement of the sampling intake at the desired sampling point, minimal disturbance of the stagnant water \ncolumn above the screened interval, monitoring of water quality indicators during purging, minimisation of \natmospheric contact with samples, and collection of unfiltered samples for metal analyses to estimate total \ncontaminant loading in the system.  While additional time is often required to purge using low-flow rates, \nthe authors state that this is compensated for by eliminating the need for filtration, decreased volume of \ncontaminated purge water and less re-sampling to address inconsistent data results.  The use of low-flow \nrate purging and sampling consistently produced filtered and unfiltered samples that showed no significant \ndifferences in concentrations.   \n \nA comparison of micropurging and traditional groundwater sampling was reported by Kearl et al. (1994).   \nTo compare methods, duplicate groundwater samples were collected at two field sites using traditional and \nmicropurge methods.  Samples were analysed for selected organic and inorganic constituents, and the \nresults were compared statistically.  Analysis of the data using the nonparametric sign test indicated that \nthere was no significant difference (at 95 percent confidence) between the two methods for the site \ncontaminants and the majority of analytes.  These analytical results were supported by visual observations \nusing a colloid borescope, which demonstrated impacts on the flow system in the well when using \ntraditional sampling methods.  Under selected circumstances, the results suggest replacing traditional \nsampling with micropurging based on reliability, cost and waste minimisation.  The authors recommend \nthat samples should be collected with dedicated sampling devices such as bladder or submersible pumps.  \nBailers should not be used, pump intakes should be located in the centre of screens unless depth specific \nsamples are required and samples should be collected 24 hours after pump installation.  In addition, only \nthe pump and tubing should be purged, as they believe it is not necessary to purge the well casing and the \nscreen. \n \nGreacen and Slivia (1994) conducted a comparison of low-flow versus high-flow (borehole purge) \nsampling methodologies on groundwater metal concentrations.  They found that although a submersible \nsampling pump provided an efficient means of collecting groundwater samples, the use of the low-flow \nsampling methodology did not provide data that could not be obtained by sampling the well at higher flow \nrates. \n \nResearch by Barcelona et al. (1994) confirmed that low-flow rate purging (i.e. ~1 L per minute) is a valid \ntechnique for 2\" (5 cm) diameter monitoring wells with short-screened intervals.  They reported that the use \nof low-flow, and dedicated pumping devices for purging and sampling minimises both the disturbance of \nstagnant water in the well casing and the potential for mobilisation of particulate or colloidal matter that \ncan lead to sampling artefacts.  In addition, these techniques allow the use of purging indicator parameters \n(e.g. dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity) to determine when to collect a sample for volatile \norganic compound (VOC) determinations.  The suggested procedure includes documenting purging \nindicator parameters while purging with dedicated devices at low-flow rates with minimal drawdown.  This \nsampling method is less time-consuming and reduces the need to handle large volumes of purge water since \nVOC concentrations, DO2 and specific conductance values stabilised consistently in less than one borehole \nvolume. \n \nAn investigation of contaminant migration by low-flow rate sampling techniques by Bangsund et al. (1994) \nused low flow rates (10-100 mL per minute) to minimise drawdown and colloidal migration.  Unfiltered \nsamples collected using these methods are believed to be more representative of actual groundwater \nquality.  Due to the nature of the contaminants, an all-stainless steel positive-displacement gas drive pump \nwas used.  Drawdown was monitored continuously during sampling.  Redox potential, pH, temperature, \nelectrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity were monitored in the field to establish water \nquality stabilisation.  Water quality in the wells stabilised after removal of one or two well volumes.  \nTurbidity and ORP were found to be the best field indicators of water quality stabilisation during sampling.  \nResults indicate that the unfiltered samples collected using the low flow sampling method have \nconcentrations of inorganic parameters roughly equal to historic filtered sample results, and as much as \nthree orders of magnitude lower than unfiltered sample results from standard sampling methods.   \n \nIn 1995, Puls and Paul conducted a field study to assess purging requirements for dedicated sampling \nsystems in conventional monitoring wells and for pumps encased in short screens and buried within a \nshallow sandy aquifer.  Low-flow purging methods were used, and wells were purged until water quality \nindicator parameters (dissolved oxygen, electrical conductance, turbidity) and contaminant concentrations \n(chromate, trichloroethylene, dichloroethlyene) reached equilibrium.  The data show that purge volumes \nwere independent of well depth or casing volumes.  Contaminant concentrations equilibrated in less than \n7.5 L of purge volume in all wells.  Initial contaminant concentration values were generally within 20 \npercent of final values.  Water quality parameters equilibrated in less than 10 L in all wells and were \nconservative measures for indicating the presence of adjacent formation water.  Water quality parameters \nequilibrated faster in dedicated sampling systems than in portable systems and initial turbidity levels were \nlower. \n \nIn 1996, Puls and Barcelona published a US EPA - Ground Water Issue to provide background information \non the development of low flow sampling procedures and its application under a variety of hydrogeological \nsettings.  \n \nVarious physical and chemical properties were monitored sequentially by Gibs et al. (2000) during well \npurging as indicators of stabilisation of the water in the well.  Turbidity was correlated with the \nconcentrations of Fe, Al and Mn in oxic groundwater, but appeared to be independent of conductivity, pH, \ntemperature or dissolved oxygen.  Pb and Cu were related to the sum of the Fe, Al and Mn.  Stabilisation of \nturbidity was found to be a good indicator of stable unfiltered trace element concentrations at all wells \nmonitored and for some filtered trace element concentrations. \n\u2018No purge\u2019 sampling \n\u2018No purge\u2019 sampling (see earlier section on Passive Diffusion Bags, Snap Sampler and Hydrasleve) is \nbecoming an increasingly accepted method of collecting representative groundwater samples for some \ndeterminands, in particular VOCs and some metals using diffusion methods.  These sampling systems are \ndeployed in the well and left to equilibrate with the formation water thus negating the need for purging.  \nDouble ended bailers can be classed as grab samplers but can also be used to purge shallow wells that have \nlow volumes of water \n \nDEDICATED PUMP VERSUS PORTABLE SAMPLE COLLECTION \nPassing a sampling device through a stagnant column of water can cause mixing with the screened interval, \ndisturbance to the suspended sediment at the bottom of the casing and displacement of water into the \nformation immediately adjacent to the well screen.  This can be avoided by using dedicated pumps.  This \napproach also minimises the potential for cross-contamination between boreholes when a common pump is \nused.  In addition, it has been shown that water quality parameters equilibrate faster in dedicated sampling \nsystems than in portable systems and initial turbidity levels tend to be lower (Puls and Powell, 1992). \n \nON-SITE WATER QUALITY MEASUREMENTS  \nOn-site water quality measurements are carried out predominantly to monitor effective purging of water at \nthe sampling point before sample collection, and to measure unstable parameters that cannot be \nsubsequently reliably determined in the laboratory.  On-site measurements can also be used to provide a \ncheck on a subsequent laboratory analysis.  For example, provided that the on-site Specific Electrical \nConductance (SEC) is measured accurately, it can be compared with the SEC estimated from the laboratory \nchemical analysis by one of a number of geochemical programmes.  This check can be useful for spotting \nmajor errors, such as dilution or typographical errors, as well as systematic errors in analytical \nmethodology. \n \nA flow-through cell should be used for taking on-site chemistry measurements from a pumped sample.  \nThis is advised as it produces an airtight environment that isolates the flowing water to be sampled from the \natmosphere.  All air bubbles must be expelled from the cell to prevent anomalous readings and a constant \nflow must be maintained.  All measurements need to be accurately recorded using a field data sheet or a \nnotebook.  Readings should be taken at regular intervals to monitor stabilisation before the final reported \nmeasurement is made. \n \nTemperature \nThe rate of many biological and chemical reactions is affected by temperature, although deep groundwater \ntemperatures are less susceptible to seasonal temperature fluctuations.  Temperature should be recorded to \n0.1 degree.  Care is needed when making measurements since groundwater temperature can change quickly \non exposure to ambient conditions and it is important to take the measurement as close as possible to the \noutlet and to exclude direct sunlight.  Reporting of other on-site parameters should be corrected to the \nappropriate temperature. \npH \npH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in solution and is also referred to as the degree of acidity \nor alkalinity.  As a sample\u2019s pH changes, many precipitation, co-precipitation and sorption processes can \noccur that alter the sample\u2019s chemical composition and reaction rates.  Biological processes of a sample are \nalso influenced by its pH.  Changes in the dissolved gas content of a sample can alter the pH.  Groundwater \nis generally in equilibrium with CO2 at a partial pressure several times that of the atmosphere.  On exposure \nto the atmosphere this CO2 escapes and the pH rises.  It is therefore important that pH is measured on-site. \nThe pH is generally measured using a combination electrode calibrated using standards of pH 4, 7and 10.  \nIn addition, it is recommended that a dilute acid solution of known pH is used as a control check and that \nadditional control standards are also checked if the pH is outside the range 4-10. \nSpecific Electrical Conductance (SEC) \nSpecific electrical conductance (SEC) is the measure of a solution\u2019s ability to conduct or carry an electric \ncurrent and depends upon the presence of charged ion species such as calcium, sodium, magnesium \nchloride, etc.  Conductivity measurements are approximately related to total dissolved solids (TDS) in a \nsample, but since different ions carry different amounts of charge and move at different speeds, their \nindividual contribution to the overall SEC varies.   \n \nSEC is measured with a conductivity meter, which normally consists of an AC bridge and a conductivity \ncell or electrodes.  The conductance is measured between two electrodes.  Two solutions of known \nconductivity should be used, one to calibrate the meter and the other to check the slope.  It is important to \ncorrect all data for water temperature, either by calculation or automatically using the meter\u2019s auto-\ntemperature correction mode, since SEC is highly dependent on temperature.  SEC increases by about 2% \nper degree rise in temperature due principally to an increase in water viscosity.  \nAlkalinity \nAlkalinity is a measure of the acid-neutralising capacity of water and is usually determined by titration \nagainst sulphuric acid to the endpoint of the acid-base reaction.  In groundwaters, the carbonate species \npredominate and an endpoint of about pH 4.5 marks the consumption of bicarbonate in solution.  The \nendpoint can be determined using an indicator dye, such as bromocresol green, or the pH can be monitored \nand the inflection of the titration curve identified.  In relatively uncommon water where the pH is high, the \ntitration curve may also indicate an inflection due to the presence of carbonate.  In some waters, other weak \nacids, such as borate, silicate and organic acids may also contribute to the alkalinity.  \n \nAlkalinity measurements are often made on-site but are sometimes not considered to be as critical as pH, \nsince loss of CO2 does not in itself change the alkalinity.  However, Shaver (1993) and Fritz (1994) found \nsignificant errors were introduced by use of laboratory rather than in-situ data.  That said, it is possible for \ninexperienced samplers to mistakenly identify the end-point of the titration in the field, and it is always \nrecommended that alkalinity is also determined back in the laboratory.  During storage there may be \nbiological activity that changes the alkalinity or extreme loss of CO2 may lead to precipitation of CaCO3 in \nthe sample bottle.  In carbonate terrains it may be necessary to filter the alkalinity sample as there may be \nsuspended particles of calcite leading to an overestimate of the value (Fritz, 1994).  For some highly \ncontaminated samples, a stable endpoint may not be obtained if there is equilibration with a solid phase. \nDissolved oxygen (DO2) \nDissolved Oxygen (DO2) levels in water depend, in part, on the chemical, physical and biochemical \nactivities occurring in the water.  Oxygen has a limited solubility in water directly related to atmospheric \npressure and inversely related to water temperature and salinity.  Low dissolved oxygen levels can limit the \nbacterial metabolism of certain organic compounds. \n \nOn-site, dissolved oxygen is commonly measured using a membrane electrode of the polarographic type in \na flow-through cell.  The zero is commonly set using a saturated solution of sodium sulphite and the 100% \nsaturated environment by holding the probe close to the surface of clean water.  Below 1 ppm, electrodes \nprovide only a qualitative measure of DO2 due to slow electrode response (Wilkin et al., 2001). \nOxidation-reduction potential (ORP) \nReduction-oxidation reactions are mediated by micro-organisms and involve the transfer of electrons \nbetween reactant and products.  Free electrons do not exist in solution, so an oxidation reaction (loss of \nelectrons) must be balanced by a reduction reaction (gain of electrons).  Redox potential is defined by the \nNernst equation and is the \nenergy gained in \nthe transfer of 1 mol of \nelectrons from an \noxidant to H2. \n \nRedox reactions control \nthe mobility of metal \nions in solution by \nchanging the \nvalence state, \nwhich in turn changes the \nsolubility of metals \ncausing them to \ndissolve into or \nprecipitate out of \nsolution; a common \nexample is the \nreduction\/oxidation \nof iron: \n \nFe3+ + e- = Fe2+ reduction (dissolved in solution) \nFe2+ = Fe3+ + e-   oxidation (precipitates out of solution) \n \nORP is measured on-site by monitoring the potential developed at a platinum surface under in-situ \nconditions in a flow-through cell.  In the presence of oxygen the electrode behaves as a Pt-O electrode and \nresponds predominantly to pH; consequently the measurement of ORP in oxygenated waters does not yield \nmuch useful information.  In reducing waters, the measured potential will be a mixture of potentials \ndeveloped from a range of redox reactions often involving iron, sulphur and nitrogen species.  The redox \nelectrode cannot be calibrated, but correct function can be checked by measuring temperature and the mV \nobtained from Zobell\u2019s solution and comparing the temperature-corrected reading with tabulated results \n(see manufacturer\u2019s information and Nordstrom (1977). \n \nORP measurements are effective in delineating oxic from anoxic groundwater, but ORP measurements \ncannot distinguish between nitrate-reducing, Fe (III)-reducing, sulfate-reducing or methanogenic zones in \nan aquifer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 On-site Water Quality Measurements Using a Flow-Through Cell \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPRESERVATION AND HANDLING OF SAMPLES \nWaters are susceptible to change by differing extents as a result of physical, chemical or biological \nreactions that take place between the time of sampling and analysis.  If suitable precautions are not taken \nbefore and during transport as well as the time spent in the laboratory, the nature and rate of these reactions \nare often such that concentrations determined will be different from those existing at the time of sampling.  \nThe causes of variation may include: \n \n\uf0b7 Consumption or modification of constituents by micro organisms \n\uf0b7 Photodegradation \n\uf0b7 Oxidation by dissolved oxygen \n\uf0b7 Precipitation  \n\uf0b7 Volatilisation \n\uf0b7 Degassing \n\uf0b7 Absorption of CO2 from the air  \n\uf0b7 Sorption of dissolved or colloidal phases to container walls \nA summary of the preservation options and recommended maximum storage periods for various \ndeterminands is given in Table 1.  The individual options are described below.  \nFiltration \nThe process of drilling, constructing, purging and sampling a well can mobilise colloids (particles ranging \nin size from 1 nm to 1000 nm) and particulates that are not moving through the groundwater under natural \nflow conditions resulting in artificially high concentrations of inorganic constituents.  These can be \nremoved by filtration, which should be carried out on-site as soon as possible after collection.  Standard \nfilters for groundwater investigations are 0.45 \u00b5m cellulose membranes.  These do not remove all \nparticulates from the sample or colloidal material of biological and non-biological origin in the 0.1-0.001 \n\u00b5m range.  Filtration should not be used if the filter is likely to retain one or more of the constituents to be \nanalysed.  Different brands may not be identical in performance (Hall et al., 1996) \n \nHigh turbidity samples can clog filters reducing the effective pore size.  To avoid this, glass fibre pre-filters \nshould be used and clogged filters changed regularly. \n \nIt is essential that the filter is not a cause of contamination and, if applicable, filters should be carefully \nwashed before use.  If possible a portion of sample should be flushed through the filter before sample \ncollection.  In general, samples for most organic determinands should NOT be filtered; highly turbid \nsamples and all samples collected for dissolved metals SHOULD be filtered. \n \nAddition of preservatives \nThe most commonly used preservatives for groundwater samples are: \n\uf0b7 Acids \n\uf0b7 Bases \n\uf0b7 Biocides \n\uf0b7 Specialised reagents, e.g. for mercury or sulphides  \nAcidification to below pH2 is particularly suitable for trace metals since it minimises adsorption of metals \nto container walls and also reduces biological activity.   Acidification prior to filtration will release metals \nbound to particulates giving a false reading if only dissolved metals are required.  Samples for anion \nanalysis are generally not acidified.  Biocides such as sodium azide are commonly added to samples for \ntrace organic compounds, such as pesticides.  The use of 0.45 \u00b5m silver filters for dissolved organic carbon \nsamples both removes particulates and introduces silver into solution, which acts as a biocide.  \nRecommended techniques for preservation of waters are given in Table 1.  It should be noted, however, \nthat preservation techniques are often governed by the analytical method to be used; hence advice should \nalways be sought from the laboratory on the type of bottle and preservation method required for each \ndeterminand. \n \nTable 1 Techniques for the preservation of samples for analysis (simplified from BSI, 1996)  \n \nGroup Examples of \ndeterminands \n \nContainer Filtration Preservation Cool to \n2-5o C \nfor \nstorage \nMaximum \nstorage \ntime \nTotal metals Al, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, \nMn, Ni, Ag, U, Zn \nPlastic - Acidify to <pH2 with \nHNO3 \n\uf0fc 1 month \nCations and \ndissolved \nmetals \nAl, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, Li, \nMn, Ni, Ag, Ca, Mg, Na, \nK, U, Zn, Sb, B, etc \nPlastic 0.45 \u00b5m \ncellulose \nAcidify to <pH2 with \nHNO3 \n\uf0fc 1 month \nRedox \nsensitive \ncations \nFe2+, NH4+ Plastic - Acidify to <pH2 and \nexclude oxygen for \nreduced species \n\uf0fc 24 hours \nAnions Br, Cl, F\u2021, NO3, o-PO4, P, \nSO42-*, I, B SiO4*, \nPlastic 0.45 \u00b5m \ncellulose \n- \uf0fc 1 month \nRedox \nsensitive \nanions  \nNO2-, Cr6+ species, CN- Plastic - Exclude oxygen for \nreduced species \n\uf0fc 24 hours \nSulphur \nspecies \nS2-, SO22-, Plastic - Fix by alkalization or \nEDTA as required \n\uf0fc 24 hours \nAnionic \nmetals \nAs, Se, Sn Plastic - Acidify to <pH1 with HCl \uf0fc 1 month \nTotal anions o-PO4, P, N Plastic - Acidify to <pH2 with \nH2SO4 \n\uf0fc 24 hours \nVolatile \ninorganics \nHg Borosilicate \nglass \n Acidify to <pH2 with \nHNO3 and add K2Cr2O7 to \n0.05% \n\uf0fc  \nOxygen \ndemand \nBOD, COD Glass - Exclude light \uf0fc 24 hours \nStable isotopes 2H, 18O, 13C Glass - - -  \nDissolved \ngases \nN2, Ar, CH4 Glass or steel \npressure \nvessel \n  -  \nFluorocarbons CFCs, SF6 Specialised \ncontainer \n  -  \nVolatile Chlorinated solvents, light Glass with - Exclude light \uf0fc 7 days \norganics hydrocarbons septum cap \nNon-volatile \norganics \nGrease, oil, pesticides, \nphenols, PAH \nGlass - Addition of biocide for \nsome determinands, \nExclude light \n\uf0fc 7 days \nSurfactants,  Anionic, non-ionic \ncationic \nGlass - Varies with type \uf0fc  \nOrganic \ncarbon \nTotal \/dissolved Glass 0.45 \u00b5m \nsilver for \ndissolved \nExclude light \uf0fc 7 days \nMicrobiology  Glass or heat \nresistant \nplastic \n    \n* can be included in cations if total element is required by ICP-OES \n\u2021 not PTFE \nSolvent extraction \nSolvent extraction used for organic analysis is not a feasible field operation and therefore samples should \nbe stored at 4\u00b0C and transported to the laboratory as soon as possible.  The use of opaque or brown glass \ncontainers can reduce the photosensitivity of the sample to a considerable extent. \nCooling or freezing \nThe sample should be kept at a temperature lower than that at which it was collected.  Cooling is only \neffective if it is applied immediately after the collection of the sample.  This normally requires the use of a \ncool box containing ice or a refrigerator in the vehicle.  Cooling is particularly important for minimising \nmicrobial activity.  In some cases samples can be frozen.  The freezing and thawing must be controlled in \norder to return the sample to its initial equilibrium after thawing.  Glass containers are not suitable for \nsamples that are to be frozen. \n \nSample containers \nIt is essential that the sample container and its cap should not be a cause of contamination, or absorb or \nreact with constituents to be determined in the sample.  For many inorganic determinands, modern plastic \ncontainers such as LDPE are probably the best option. \n \nIt is advised that sample bottles are soaked in a 1 molar solution of the preservative acid and thoroughly \nrinsed in high grade deionised or distilled water.  For phosphate, silicon, boron and surfactants, detergents \nshould not be used for cleaning purposes.  For pesticides and their residues, containers should be cleaned \nwith water and detergent followed by thorough rinsing with high grade water, oven drying at 105\u00b0C and \nrinsing with the solvent to be used during the analysis.  For TOC\/DOC the use of carefully cleaned \ncontainers using chromic acid or a specialised surfactant is essential.  For microbiological analyses, the \ncontainer must be able to withstand sterilisation procedures. \nIn general it is advisable to fill the container as completely as possible to minimise interaction with the gas \nphase and consequent changes in carbon dioxide content and pH.  Where samples are to be acidified, \nsufficient space must be allowed for in the container.  For trace volatile organics that are not to be extracted \non-site, it is absolutely essential to fill the container completely so that no air bubbles are seen when the \ncontainer is inverted to minimise partitioning of the volatiles into the gas phase.  For microbiological \nexamination, an air space should be left so the sample container should not be filled to the brim.  This aids \nin mixing before examination and avoidance of accidental contamination.   \n \nWhere sufficient volume is available, all containers and caps should be rinsed several times with sample \nbefore collecting the sample. \nQUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES  \nIt is important that sample integrity be maintained and guaranteed throughout the collection, transport and \nanalytical processes; this can be achieved by including strict QA\/QC procedures in the sampling protocol.  \nThe areas that should be considered are: \nBlank samples \nBlanks consist of deionised water that is carried through all or part of the sampling and analytical processes \nto provide an indication of contamination.  Types of blank sample include both laboratory and field blanks, \nlisted below in ascending order of cumulative potential contamination. \n \nLaboratory blanks \nInstrument blank \u2013 a blank analysed with field samples to assess the presence or absence of instrument \ncontamination.   \n \nMethod blank \u2013 an analytical control consisting of all reagents, internal standards and surrogate standards, \nwhich is carried through the entire analytical procedure.  The method blank is used to define the level of \nlaboratory background and reagent contamination. \n \nField blanks \nTrip blanks \u2013 a clean sample that is sent from the laboratory with the empty sampling bottles and remains \nwith other samples throughout the sampling trip without being opened.  This is typically only required for \nvolatiles and assesses contamination during shipping and field handling. \n \nField blanks \u2013 field blanks are performed by passing a volume of contaminant-free water through all \nprocessing equipment that an environmental sample would contact including filtration, addition of \npreservative, transfer to the sample container in the field, and shipping to the laboratory with field samples. \nThe results of field blanks can be used to assess contamination issues associated with processing and \ntransporting the sample. \n \nEquipment blanks - a sample of contaminant-free water poured through decontaminated field sampling \nequipment prior to the collection of field samples.  For pump blanks, two blanks may be taken: one before \nthe pump is cleaned and one after.  A sample of the water used to pass through the pump should also be \ncollected.  These samples should be taken at the beginning and end of each day\u2019s sampling.  These blanks \nassess the adequacy of the decontamination process and also assess the total contamination from sampling \nsample preparation and measurement processes. \n \nReplicate samples \nReplicate samples should be collected at the same time (preferably a split of one sample rather than by \ncollecting two or more concurrent samples in the field) and undergo the same filtration, preservation and \nstorage.  These replicate samples measure the variability of the processing techniques and the laboratory \nprecision, but exclude field-sampling variability. \n \nSpiked samples \nField matrix spikes can be carried out by adding a known amount of a spike solution with a known \nconcentration to a replicate sample.  Spike recoveries can be used to identify which compounds are \nconsistently under or over reported or which compounds are variable in their recoveries.  This is \nparticularly relevant to the analysis of organic contaminants. \nLabelling \nContainers should be labelled in a clear and durable manner to permit identification without ambiguity in \nthe laboratory.  Sample labels should adhere firmly to bottles.  Sample lists should be provided to the \nlaboratory. \nTransport \nIt is important that the samples are transported quickly, safely and securely from field to laboratory.  In \nparticular, care must be taken to ensure that bottles are protected from breakage (particularly glass bottles) \nand loss of sample and that they are held at the required temperature.  \nLaboratory reception \nOn arrival at the laboratory, the samples should be preserved under conditions that minimise any \ncontamination of the outside of the containers and that prevent any change in their content. \nChain of custody \nChain of custody paperwork should be completed and copies retained.  A chain of custody is a set of \nprocedures used to provide an accurate written record that can be used to trace the possession of a sample \nfrom the moment of its collection through its introduction into a data set.  Sample identity is maintained by \nproper labelling.  Each person involved in the chain of possession must sign a chain-of-custody form when \nsample custody is relinquished or received. \nA chain-of-custody form is a document used to record the transfer, possession, and custody of samples and \nto ensure the integrity of samples from the time of collection through data reporting.  The chain-of-custody \nform should, at a minimum, contain the following information: \n \n\uf0b7 Contact name and address of sampler \n\uf0b7 Signature of sampler \n\uf0b7 Order\/batch number \n\uf0b7 Sample id \n\uf0b7 Sample location \n\uf0b7 Date \n\uf0b7 Time \n\uf0b7 Sample type \n\uf0b7 Number of containers \n\uf0b7 Details of analysis required \n\uf0b7 Dispatcher signature and date\/time \n\uf0b7 Courier signature and date\/time \n\uf0b7 Laboratory receipt signature and date\/time \nDATA VALIDATION \nThere are a number of relatively simple tests that can be employed to evaluate the analytical data and to \ncheck for possible transcription or dilution errors, changes during storage or unusual or unlikely values.  A \ndiscussion of these can be found in Hem (1985) and Cook et al. (1989), among others.  \nComparison of field and laboratory values  \nThe comparison of field and laboratory determined results for parameters such as alkalinity and SEC can be \nindicative of: \n\uf0b7 Sample confusion, e.g. errors arising from mislabelling \n\uf0b7 Sample storage problems \nComparison with other samples from the same source \nA simple screening procedure for evaluating analyses from the same or similar sources is to compare the \nresults with one another.  Transcription or dilution errors become readily evident. \nComparison with other samples from the area \nA table of minimum and maximum values is helpful for identifying unusually low or high values.  The data \nshould be evaluated for a consistent pattern of highs and lows and anticipated correlations. \nComparison of SEC and TDS \nAn approximate accuracy check is possible using the SEC and TDS determinations.  The TDS (in mg L-1) \nshould be between 0.55 and 0.75 times the SEC (in \u00b5S\/cm) for most waters up to a TDS of a few thousand \nmg L.-1.  Water in which anions are mostly dominated by bicarbonate and chloride should have a factor \nnear the lower end of this range whereas waters high in sulphate may reach or even exceed the upper end.  \nFor repeated analyses from the same area, a well-defined relationship can often be established. \nEvaluation of charge balance errors  \nThe quality of chemical analyses can be checked on the basis of an ionic charge balance.  This check \nshould be carried out as soon as possible, while the chemical analysis can still be repeated.  The ion balance \ncan only be calculated for samples that have complete chemical analyses.  The main purpose is to detect \nobvious errors and bias in the analysis but it will only detect these in the major species.  Some errors may \ncancel each other out and this check does not provide confidence in major uncharged species, such as silica, \nor trace elements.  The effect on the balance of minor components, e.g. phosphates and organic acids, \nwhich are not always included in the analysis, is usually negligible.  Bicarbonate ions dissociate into \ncarbonate ions, but this is negligible below pH=8.  For neutral groundwater the charge balance (CB) is \ncalculated as the total cation charge minus the total anion charge divided by the total charge in solution all \nexpressed in microequivalents per litre: \n \n \n \n \n \nFor very alkaline waters it may be necessary to include other species such as carbonate or silicate ions.  \nAcid water will contain H+ ions, but water with a pH of less than 4.5 may not provide a usable acidity due \nto interference from other species such as some iron hydroxides.   \n \nAs a general guideline, based upon the difference and the sum of cation and anion concentrations, the \npercentage ionic charge balance should be lower than \u00b15%, except for samples with low TDS. \n  \nThere are some instances where the charge balance may not detect errors:  \n\uf0b7 Waters with a TDS of greater than 1000 mg L -1tend to have large concentrations of a few constituents \nand the charge balance does not adequately evaluate the accuracy of the values of the minor \nconstituents.  \n\uf0b7 Solutions that are strongly coloured may contain organic anions at sufficiently large concentrations to \nprevent a satisfactory balance being obtained.  \n\uf0b7 Waters of low ionic strength (generally cation or anion totals <1 mg L-1) in which determinands may \nbe close to or less than the limit of quantification. \nComparison of measured and calculated TDS (or measured and calculated SEC)  \nAssuming that the TDS or SEC is measured accurately, it can provide a check on the subsequent chemical \nanalysis.  This check is useful for spotting major errors, such as dilution or typographical errors as well as \nsystematic errors in analytical methodology.  It does not provide a check on any minor species or, in the \ncase of SEC, uncharged species such as silica.  Exactly which major species are present in any given water \nsample will depend on the type of water considered; Table 2 provides some guidance  for calculating SEC. \n\uf0e5\uf03d FCSEC .  \nwhere C is concentration in equivalents and F is ionic conductance. \nTable 2  Ionic conductance at infinite solution and 25\u00b0C for different aqueous species (MacInnes \n1939) \n \nSpecies Equivalent ionic conductance \n(S.cm2\/eq) \nUse \nAcetate 40.9 Polluted waters \nBa2+ 63.6 Where significant \nBr- 78.4 Where significant \n \n)(\n)()(100\n343\n343\nNOSOClHCOMgCaKNa\nNOSOClHCOMgCaKNaCB \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\nCa2+ 59.5 Routine \nCl- 76.3 Routine \nF- 55.4 Where significant \nH+ 349.7 Acid rain and waters below pH5 \nHCO3- 44.5 Routine \nI- 76.8 Where significant \nK+ 73.5 Routine \nLi+ 38.7 Where significant \nMg2+ 53.0 Routine \nNa+ 50.1 Routine \nNH4+-N 73.5 Polluted waters \nNO3\u2014N 71.4 Routine \nOH- 198.0 Waters above pH12 \nOther organic anions Varies Some brown coloured waters \nSO42-S 79.8 Routine \nSr2+ 59.5 Where significant \n \nApparent anomalies and impossibilities \nSpecies reported should be correct with regard to the original pH of the sample.  At a neutral pH, carbonate \nspecies will be almost all HCO3 and high CO3 cannot exist. \nHigh Fe concentrations can be a problem to interpret since under oxidising conditions all Fe would be \nexpected to be present as a highly insoluble Fe oxide.  If high concentrations of iron are found then either \nthe water must be reducing or some iron has passed the filter; this also applies for Al.  Other possible \nanomalies to monitor data for are: \n\uf0b7 Incompatible combinations of species, e.g. nitrate in presence of Fe2+ or the absence of dissolved \noxygen  \n\uf0b7 Totals of any variable less than the sum of the component parts, e.g. total iron less than dissolved iron. \n\uf0b7 Reported results not in the range of the technique or not theoretically possible, e.g. pH>14 \n\uf0b7 Apparent zero concentrations for major ions, such as Na or Ca.  A zero concentration is rare if these \nelements have actually been determined. \n\uf0b7 Unusual parameter ratios, e.g. Ca\/Mg or Na\/Cl.  For example, groups of analyses where all magnesium \nconcentrations are similar but calcium concentrations have a wide range may indicate that calcium and \nbicarbonate were lost during sampling or storage. \n \nHEALTH AND SAFETY IN FIELDWORK \n \nIn all aspects of site investigations, health and safety considerations should take priority.  Staff should be \nsuitably trained and adequately supervised.  Particular care should be taken with monitoring locations that \npose particular difficulties for access or that are unsafe in any other way.  Risk assessments should be \nprepared in advance and reviewed at regular intervals.  Suitable personal protective equipment and \nemergency equipment and protocols should be available. \n \nREFERENCES  \nBangsund, W J, Peng, C G and Mattsfield, W R.  1994.
