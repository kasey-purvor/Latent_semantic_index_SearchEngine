Such tests have\nyet to be established for the pig. In order to measure serum TTR in the pig during an acute phase\nresponse an assay was developed using anti-human TTR antibodies which cross reacted with\nporcine TTR. The assay had a detection limit of 32 \u00b5g\/mL while the mean concentration of\ntransthyretin measured in healthy pig serum was 302 \u00b1 8 \u00b5g\/mL (n = 63). There was no significant\ndifference in the serum concentration of TTR in three different age groups from 10 to 25 weeks.\nFollowing Streptococcus suis type 2 infection transthyretin showed a negative acute phase response\nwith serum concentrations reaching a significantly lower level at two days following infection.\nacute phase proteins \/ pigs \/ infection Streptococcus suis\n1. INTRODUCTION\nAcute phase proteins (APP) are blood\nproteins, which alter concentration dramat-\nically following infection, inflammation\nand trauma [10]. The serum level of these\nproteins either increases in the case of pos-\nitive acute phase proteins such as hap-\ntoglobin, C-reactive protein and serum\namyloid A [5] or decreases in the case of\nnegative acute phase proteins such as tran-\nsthyretin (TTR) [13, 14]. The level of pos-\nitive APP in porcine sera has been shown to\nprovide an objective measure of animal\nhealth status and is becoming widely used\nas a gauge of animal welfare which is\nunderstood as freedom of disease and, to a\ncertain extent stress [8, 12, 17\u201319, 21]. In\naddition, concentration of the positive acute\nphase proteins has been shown to be pro-\nportional to the severity of the condition so\nthey can be used both to monitor the pres-\nence and extent of a disease in pigs [3, 7]\nand may also be used to measure the effi-\ncacy of antibiotic treatment [12, 15, 16]. In\nhuman medicine the CRP\/TTR ratio has\n* Corresponding author: p.d.eckersall@vet.gla.ac.uk\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.edpsciences.org\/vetres or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/vetres:2005017\n658 F.M. Campbell et al.\nbeen used for the early diagnosis of post\noperative bacterial infection [9]. Monitor-\ning the levels of negative acute phase reac-\ntants in porcine sera in addition to the pos-\nitive ones should bring additional value to\nthese measurements, for example by con-\nstituting an internal control for dilution and\nevaporation artefacts. \nTTR, also known as thyroxin-binding\nprealbumin, is a serum protein with a\nmolecular mass of ~ 55 kDa made up of four\nidentical subunits. It is one of the three\nmajor thyroxin binding proteins and forms\na complex with retinol binding protein to\naid the transport of vitamin A in plasma [14,\n20]. The porcine isoform shares 85%\nsequence homology with the human form\nbut has three additional amino acids at the\nC-terminus (Gly-Ala-Leu) giving it a sub-\nunit length of 130 amino acids [2, 6]. In man\nTTR serum levels fall due to decreased syn-\nthesis in inflammation and stress [13].\nHuman serum levels of TTR have been\nmeasured for hospital patients as an indica-\ntor of health status [4, 11, 22] and a number\nof commercial assays are available for this\npurpose. However, whether transthyretin is\nindeed a negative acute phase reactant has\nyet to be established for the pig. Therefore\nthe aim of this study was to develop and val-\nidate an assay to measure TTR in porcine\nserum and to use this assay to determine\nwhether TTR levels in porcine sera fall dur-\ning an acute phase response. An enzyme\nlinked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) was\nestablished for this purpose using an antise-\nrum to human TTR. The specificity of this\nantiserum for porcine TTR was confirmed\nby western blotting.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1. Animals and collection of samples\nBlood samples were collected from two\ndifferent groups of animals. The first group\nwas made up of 63 conventionally housed\nhealthy pigs. Animals were defined as\nhealthy on the basis of a clinical examina-\ntion in the herd by a trained technician look-\ning at the moving animal and at the immo-\nbilised animal that was palpated (limbs and\numbilicus). Three pigs from each of three\nage groups, 10\u201314, 15\u201319 and 20\u201325 weeks\nfrom each of 7 different herds were used.\nAdditional blood samples were collected\nfrom a second group of five pigs (approx.\n6 weeks of age at time of infection) from\ndays \u20138, 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 12 and 14 after infec-\ntion with a Streptococcus suis type 2 isolate.\nThe experimental animals were infected by\nsubcutaneous injection of approx. 1011 CFU\nof S. suis strain SS02-0119 as previously\ndescribed [1]. Blood was allowed to clot\nand serum aspirated and stored at \u201320 \u00b0C\nuntil analysed. Establishment of infection\nwas confirmed in all five pigs by culture of\nS. suis type 2 from blood samples on day 1\nand 8 post inoculation (p.i.). The pigs were\nmonitored by recording clinical signs of\ndisease and body temperature daily through-\nout the experiment. Four of the five pigs\ndeveloped transient signs of arthritis during\ndays 2\u20137 p.i. Arthritis was confirmed by\nhistopathological examination. These four\npigs also developed fever, defined as a rise\nin temperature \u2265 40 \u00b0C. One pig did not\ndevelop any clinical signs of disease or\nfever. All animal experiments were per-\nformed in accordance with a licence from\nthe Danish Animal Experiments Inspector-\nate.\n2.2. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis\nPorcine serum was prepared in rehydra-\ntion buffer (8 M urea, 2% w\/v CHAPS,\n0.5% Biolyte 3\u201310 IPG Buffer and 2.8 %\nw\/v dithiothreitol) at a protein concentra-\ntion of 1 mg\/mL. The sample (125 \u00b5L) was\nthen applied to 7 cm immobilised pH gra-\ndient gel (IPG) ready strip pH 3\u201310 (Bio-\nRad, Hemel Hemsted, UK) which was then\nrehydrated in a Bio-Rad Protean IEF cell for\n600 VHrs followed by isoelectric focusing\nfor 24 000 VHrs.\nImmediately following IEF the strip was\nequilibrated with 6 M urea, 0.375 M Tris\nMeasuring transthyretin levels in porcine serum 659\npH 8.8, 1% v\/w, SDS, 20% (v\/v) glycerol\nand 2% (w\/v) dithiothreitol for 10 min and\nthen for a further 10 min in the same buffer\nwith the dithiothreitol replaced by 2.5% (w\/v)\niodoacetamide. After equilibration the strip\nwas applied to a 15% polyacryamide gel\nwhich was run on Bio-Rad Mini Protean\n3 system according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. Gels were then stained with\nCoomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. \n2.3. Immunoblotting\nProteins were transferred from acryla-\nmide gels onto nitrocellulose membranes at\n100 V for 1 h using the mini Trans-Blot Cell\n(Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempsted, UK). Transfer\nbuffer was 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine,\npH 8.3, 20% (v\/v) methanol. Following\nprotein transfer the membranes were\nblocked with 5% (w\/v) non fat dry milk,\n0.1% Tween-20 in Tris buffered saline\n(TBS), (100 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 150 mM NaCl)\npH 7.4 (TTBS). The membranes were then\nincubated for 1 h with sheep anti-human\nprealbumin (TTR) (IgG fraction) (ICN Bio-\nmedicals, Basingstoke UK) diluted 1\/1000\nin TTBS containing 0.5% non fat dried\nmilk, washed with TTBS and then incu-\nbated with HRP conjugated anti-sheep IgG\n(Sigma, Poole, UK) 1:2000 in TTBS for\n30 min. The membrane was washed with\nTTBS three times and then developed using\nthe Opti-4CN Substrate Kit (Bio-Rad,\nHemel Hempsted, UK).\n2.4. Mass spectrometry\nMass spectrometry (MS) was carried out\nat The Sir Henry Wellcome Functional\nGenomics Facility at The University of\nGlasgow. Spots from Coomassie Blue\nstained gels were excised and subjected to\ndigestion with trypsin. Extracted peptides\nwere desalted manually (ZipTip tips, Mill-\nipore, UK) before using Q-Star Pulsar\u2122\nLC\/MS\/MS (Applied Biosystems, UK) for\nsequence analysis of the peptides. The\nresulting MS\/MS data were then searched\nin-house using Mascot\u2122 software (http:\/\/\nwww.matrixscience.com\/) equipped with\ntranslated databases for protein identifica-\ntion.\n2.5. Confirmation of antibody specificity\nTo confirm the specificity of the sheep\nanti-human prealbumin raised to human\nTTR it was tested for cross reactivity with\nporcine TTR. Porcine serum was run on 2D\nPAGE and the resulting gel stained with\nCoomassie Blue (Fig. 1A) an identical gel\n\u0000\u0001\n\u0002 \u0003\u0004\n\u0003\u0005 \u0007\b\t\n\u0000\u0001\n\u0002 \u0003\u0004\nFigure 1. (A) 2-Dimensional electrophoresis gel of porcine serum stained with Coomasie Brilliant\nBlue. (B) Immunoblot of 2DE gel showing crossreactivity with sheep anti-human prealbumin anti-\nserum.\n660 F.M. Campbell et al.\nwas run and transferred to nitrocellulose,\nimmuno blotting was carried out using anti\nhuman TTR (Fig. 1B). The protein spot on\nthe Coomassie Blue stained gel which\nshowed cross reactivity with anti TTR was\ncut from the gel and confirmed as porcine\ntransthyretin after MS of the peptides gen-\nerated following digestion by trypsin. The\nMS fingerprint data was examined using\nMascot\u2122, MS\/MS Ions Search Analysis\nand showed protein identity matches to\naccession number gi|47523508 (similar to\ntransthyretin (prealbumin), amyloidosis type\nI) [Sus scrofa] and to accession number\ngi|975233 (putative transthyretin (prealbu-\nmin) [Sus scrofa] [6]. The antibody was\ntherefore specific for porcine transthyretin\nand could be used to measure transthyretin\nlevels in porcine sera. \n2.6. TTR assay development\nMicrotiterplates (96 well, Corning Cos-\ntar, Cambridge UK) were coated with serum\nsamples or purified human prealbumin\n(TTR) (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) diluted\nin 50 mM NaHCO3 (pH 9.6), 100 \u00b5L\/well\nfor 20 hours at 4 oC. The samples were then\ndecanted and unbound sites blocked by\nadding 250 \u00b5L of 5% (w\/v) non fat dried\nmilk in assay buffer, (0.12 M NaCl, 0.02 M\nNa2HPO4, 0.1% (v\/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4) at\nroom temperature for 30 min. The plates\nwere washed with assay buffer and then\n100 \u00b5L of sheep anti-human TTR diluted\n1\/1000 in assay buffer was added to each\nwell and the plates incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C.\nThe wells were then decanted and washed\nthree times in assay buffer. Then 100 \u00b5L of\nHRP conjugated anti-sheep IgG (Sigma,\nPoole, UK) 1:2000 in assay buffer was\nadded to each well and incubated for 30 min\nat 37 \u00b0C. After washing three times with\nassay buffer the wells were filled with\n100 \u00b5L freshly prepared TMB substrate\nsolution (KPL, Guildford, UK) the reaction\nwas stopped after 30 min by the addition of\n50 \u00b5L of 1 M HCl and then the absorbance\nwas read at 450 nm. The TTR concentration\nin the serum samples after a 1:400 dilution\nwas compared to a standard curve of human\nTTR over a range of 0.03\u20132.00 \u00b5g\/mL.\nDetection limits were determined by meas-\nuring 15 replicates of saline and replicates\nof the lowest concentration standard and\ncalculating the mean concentration of\nsaline +2 SD of the lowest concentration\nusing human TTR as standard.\n2.7. Acute phase protein measurements\nSerum amyloid A (SAA) in porcine\nserum was assayed using the Phase SAA\nAssay kit (Tridelta Development plc, Ireland)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n2.8. Statistical analysis\nData are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM.\nComparisons were performed using paired\nt-test. Significance was set at P < 0.05. \n3. RESULTS\nInitially a standard curve was estab-\nlished by binding increasing amounts of\npurified human TTR to a microtitre plate.\nFigure 2A shows a representative standard\ncurve and parallel curve for doubling dilu-\ntions of pooled porcine sera starting with a\n1 in 400 dilution. The lower detection limit\nfor porcine serum TTR (1:1000 dilution)\nwas determined as 0.032 \u00b5g\/mL. Linearity\nunder dilution was demonstrated by a plot\nof measured versus calculated values of\nTTR in porcine serum which had a regres-\nsion line with equation y = 1.0269x + 3.543\nand a correlation coefficient of 0.997. The\ninterassay precision determined by calcula-\ntion of coefficient of variance (CV) of 8.4 %\nat 129.4 \u00b5g\/mL and 13.8% at 83.6 \u00b5g\/mL\nwas obtained by measuring the same two\nporcine serum samples in 18 separate\nassays. The intraassay CV was ascertained\nto be 2.2 % being the mean of the CVs of\n28 duplicate samples in the same assay at a\nconcentration range of 117\u2013292 \u00b5g\/mL.\nMeasuring transthyretin levels in porcine serum 661\nSerum samples taken from individual\nhealthy pigs, in three different age groups\n(n = 21 per group) were assayed for TTR\n(Fig. 3) and showed there were no differ-\nences in TTR concentrations between the\nage groups. The mean value for all of the\nsamples was 302 \u00b1 8 \u00b5g\/mL (n = 63). In\norder to assess the acute phase reaction of\ntransthyretin in pigs following infection\nTTR was measured in serum samples from\nfive pigs at time intervals following infec-\ntion with a S. suis type 2, ribotype I isolate\nadministered by subcutaneous injection.\nThese samples were tested in duplicate in\nthe same analytical run. The mean values\nfor all five pigs at each time interval is\nshown in Figure 4. A drop in transthyretin\nlevels was observed with the mean TTR\nconcentration falling to 81% of preinfec-\ntion concentration by day 2 following injec-\ntion. This fall was found to be significantly\ndifferent (P = 0.004 two tailed paired t test)\nFigure 2.

Campbell et al.\nfrom the values prior to infection (day 0).\nThe serum level of the positive acute phase\nprotein SAA was also measured in these\nsamples (Fig. 5) and serum levels of SAA\nincreased significantly by day 1 and day 2\nreaching a mean value of 232 \u00b1 34.8 \u00b5g\/mL\nfollowing infection before returning to base\nline levels.\n4. DISCUSSION\nFor the first time a method to measure the\nlevels of transthyretin in porcine serum has\nbeen developed which shows that TTR is a\nnegative acute phase reactant in pig.\n Immunoblotting and mass spectrometry\ndemonstrated that commercially available\nsheep polyclonal antiserum raised to human\ntransthyretin cross reacted with porcine TTR.\nThis cross reactivity is probably due to the\n85% amino acid sequence homology between\nporcine and human transthyretin protein\nsequences and the lack of glycosylation of\nTTR [14, 20]. The specific antibody was\nused to develop an assay for measuring\ntransthyretin in pig serum. Accuracy of the\nassay was demonstrated by the parallel\ncurve obtained by serial dilution of a por-\ncine serum sample compared to the stand-\nard curve. The CV calculations (< 130 \u00b5g\/mL)\nfall below the normal range (300 \u00b5g\/mL)\nand the range during S. suis infection\n(> 200 \u00b5g\/mL) and it is possible that the\ninter-assay CV may increase with increas-\ning concentrations of transthyretin. How-\never, no significant differences were found\nin values obtained from repeat assays of\nsamples containing > 250 \u00b5g\/mL of TTR.\nUsing this assay TTR in porcine sera can be\nmeasured in a consistent and reproducible\nmanner with acceptable precision.\n Following S. suis infection transthyretin\nshowed a negative acute phase response\nwith serum levels falling significantly two\ndays following treatment then returning to\npretreatment values after 5 days. In contrast\nserum levels of SAA which is an estab-\nlished acute phase indicator in pigs [12]\nrose one day after infection, remained high\nfor two days and then fell back to baseline\nlevels after 5 days. The fall in levels of TTR\nduring the acute phase response was rela-\ntively small compared to the increases\nfound in SAA which increased by 39 fold.\nHowever, it is consistent with drops in\nhuman transthyretin levels following infec-\ntion reported previously [9].\nThe assay we have developed for TTR\nmay have the disadvantage of relying on\npassively adsorbing the antigen to a surface\nin competition with all the other serum\nFigure 4.

This, on the other hand may be less\nof a drawback considering that TTR con-\ncentrations vary only slightly. However the\ndetection limit might be lowered signifi-\ncantly by using a sandwich ELISA with\nantibodies raised to purified porcine tran-\nsthyretin to trap the TTR. \nIt is possible therefore that porcine TTR\ncould be a valuable negative acute phase\nprotein for monitoring the health of pigs.\nIndeed even if the acute phase change of\nTTR in pigs adds only marginally to the\ndiagnostic information on the acute phase\nits measurement may be more useful for\nmonitoring nutritional or growth related\nphenomena as it is in man [14]. \nIn conclusion we have developed a\nmeans to measure TTR in pig serum and\ndemonstrated that the concentration of this\nprotein in serum falls in response to S. suis\ntype 2 infection. Measuring the levels of\nTTR in serum in addition to other acute\nphase proteins to monitor pig health status\nmay provide extra information and war-\nrants further investigation.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was funded by EU Contract\nNo. QLK5-CT-2001-02219 \u2013 APP in pig\nproduction.
