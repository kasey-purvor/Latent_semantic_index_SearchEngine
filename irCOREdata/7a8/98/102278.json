INTRODUCTION\nThe study of quantum dots in semiconductors has proved\nhighly fruitful recently, with the majority of work concentrat-\ning on the properties of the InAs\/GaAs system. Recently it\nhas been found that by the use of InSb\/GaSb structures it is\npossible to extend the emission wavelengths to the region\naround 2 mm.1,2 As a result of the much shallower confine-\nment potential, these structures were shown to have substan-\ntially smaller confinement energies. In this work we report\non a study of the quantum dot levels in this system by using\ndirect intradot transitions detected using the double-\nresonance technique of far-infrared modulated\nphotoluminescence3 ~FIRM-PL!. This enables us to measure\nelectron states independently and to demonstrate the exis-\ntence of excited states as well as giving an improved resolu-\ntion for the quantum dot energy levels compared to interband\nmeasurements.\nThere have been several measurements of direct absorp-\ntion intraband spectroscopy in semiconductor quantum\ndots,4\u20138 however these usually require multiple electron oc-\ncupancy of the dots induced by either doping or high inter-\nband optical excitation intensity.9 In this work we use the\nFIRM-PL technique in which the use of a tunable high power\nFIR laser enables the average dot occupancy to be relatively\nlow. This technique has previously been used by Murdin\net al.10 to study InAs\/GaAs quantum dots allowing them to\nmake an unequivocal assignment of the resonant intradot\ntransitions simultaneously with the interband excitation in\nneutral dots.\nThe InSb\/GaSb dot system has a number of substantial\ndifferences from most other semiconductor dot systems, due\nto the relatively shallow dot confinement potential. This\nleads to much stronger \u2018\u2018lateral communication\u2019\u2019 than is\nthought to occur in most other quantum dot systems.2 In\ncontrast to InAs\/GaAs quantum dots, where the distribution\nof occupied dots is frozen-in at more than 100 K, the energy\nof the wetting layer is close to that of the dots. It is believed0163-1829\/2003\/68~16!\/165307~5!\/$20.00 68 1653that the excitons remain in thermal equilibrium until quite\nlow temperatures and hence populate more of the lowest en-\nergy dots in the overall distribution of dot sizes and energies.\nA further important question is whether or not the confine-\nment is strong enough for the dots in this system to contain\nexcited states, since none could be resolved in the previous\nPL studies.2\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe samples studied consisted of InSb\/GaSb self-\nassembled quantum dots grown on both GaAs @sample A\n~3182!# and GaSb @sample B ~4174!# substrates by metal or-\nganic vapor phase epitaxy. Sample A, with the GaAs sub-\nstrate material is the same sample as used in Ref. 2, where a\n2-mm buffer layer of GaSb was first grown, followed by a\nlow-temperature 4-s layer of InSb and a capping layer of\nGaSb. In the case of the GaSb substrate it was only necessary\nto grow a thin, ;0.5-mm buffer layer before a similar dot\ngrowth sequence. The buffer layer is p-type with a doping\nlevel of ;1022 m23, leading to some equilibrium hole popu-\nlation in the dots. The dot density is estimated to be\n;1013 m22. The dot dimensions were typically found by\natomic force microscopy ~AFM! to be ;38 nm in diameter\nand about 4-nm high.1\nThe experiments were performed at FELIX, the Free\nElectron Laser ~FEL! facility at FOM, Rijnhuizen, which is\ncontinuously tunable from ;4.5 to 250 mm. The FIR comes\nin macropulses 5-ms long, each separated by 200 ms, and\neach macropulse consists of a train of micropulses about 4 ps\nin duration with a separation of 1 ns. The experiments were\nperformed by measuring the basic PL signal simultaneously\nwith the FIR modulated component while scanning a mono-\nchromator. The FIR energy was then changed and the spectra\nrecorded again. The sample was mounted on the cold finger\nof a continuous flow liquid-helium cryostat with polypropyl-\nene windows to transmit the FIR light. A 0.4 W cm22 cw\nHeNe laser was used to excite the interband transition, inci-\ndent on the top surface of the sample. The photolumines-\u00a92003 The American Physical Society07-1\nR. A. CHILD et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 68, 165307 ~2003!cence was collected and focused into a Triax 320 300 g\/mm\ngrating monochromator and detected by a liquid nitrogen\ncooled Ge p-i-n diode detector. FELIX was used as the FIR\nsource, illuminating the back of the sample through a hole in\nthe mounting plate, inducing a change in the photolumines-\ncence. The detector response time was sufficient to detect the\noverall modulation at 5 Hz produced by the macropulses, but\nwas too slow to resolve the individual micropulses. The Ge\ndetector had a dc output and an ac output enabling the simul-\ntaneous collection of the photoluminescence and FIRM-PL\nsignal.\nIII. FIRM-PL\nThe energy region chosen for study, between 5 and 25\nmeV, is readily available using FELIX and was based on the\nconfinement energies of the dots which are known to lie in\nthe range of 6\u201320 meV.2\nA. FIR power dependence\nBefore the frequency dependence was studied on sample\nB ~4174!, a study was first performed on the FIR power\ndependence at 4.2 K on sample A ~3182! which has been\nstudied extensively by Alphande\u00b4ry et al.1,2 In this sample the\nPL signal is dominated by the quantum dot signal at 0.73 eV\nas shown in Fig. 1.\nThe FIR power dependence of the FIRM-PL signal is also\nillustrated in Fig. 1 using a FIR energy of 14 meV. It shows\nthat the intensity level of the FIR can have a significant\neffect on the modulated photoluminescence signal with two\nregimes being observed. Very low intensity FIR was found to\nenhance the dot photoluminescence, while higher FIR inten-\nsities caused the PL to be suppressed, leading to a negative\nFIRM-PL signal. The intensity at which the response\nchanged sign was also energy dependent, causing distortions\nin the line shape at intermediate power levels. At the lowest\nFIR intensities the overall FIRM-PL signal is biased slightly\ntowards lower energy. As the intensity increases the low-\nFIG. 1. The FIRM-PL signal of sample A as a function of pho-\nton energy for different FIR attenuation levels ~in dB! at a FIR\nwavelength of 90 mm.16530energy side of the resonance is the first to change sign, caus-\ning an apparent shift to higher energies in the 35 dB trace.\nBy 30 dB the high-energy side of the resonance is passing\nthrough zero and the peak appears to be shifted to lower\nenergies and by 25 dB the whole peak is giving a negative\nFIRM-PL response.\nThis behavior can be understood through consideration of\nthe redistribution of carriers amongst dots with a distribution\nof dot energies. In the absence of the FIR, at low tempera-\ntures the distribution of the photoexcited electrons is non-\nthermal as they at first cool and then become localized within\na particular subset of quantum dots. This occurs once they\nare sufficiently strongly bound so that there is insufficient\ntime for the electrons to thermalize within the distribution of\ndot energies before recombination happens. By contrast the\nmuch larger density of equilibrium holes coming from the\np-type GaSb matrix are primarily localized in the larger dots.\nIn InSb quantum dots, the transition to a nonthermal distri-\nbution was shown to occur at ;10 K which is a factor of\norder 10 lower in temperature than for the InAs\/GaAs system\ndue to the much smaller localization energy.11 The resulting\ndot occupancy corresponds to a distribution whose average\nlateral confinement energy is ;6 meV.2\nWhen the sample is irradiated with low intensity FIR en-\nergy the carrier distribution can be strongly influenced as\nelectrons within individual dots will be excited to higher\nenergies where they have a higher escape rate due to the\nreduced localization energy and the possibility of further FIR\nabsorption. This provides a mechanism whereby the carriers\ncan show enhanced communication and thus increased PL\nefficiency, as shown schematically in Fig. 2~a!. The shorter\nelectron escape time compared with the recombination time\nenables the preferential population of larger, lower-energy\ndots to occur and also increases the probability of exciton\nformation. This causes an increase in PL intensity and the\nincrease in the population of larger, lower-energy dots results\nin the FIRM-PL energy shifting slightly to lower energies.\nBeyond a certain level of FIR intensity, which will be\nreferred to as the FIR high power limit, gross heating of the\ncarriers will occur. For the sample studied here this occurred\nat around an attenuation level of 32 dB. A typical initial\nbeam intensity of 20 mW with an additional attenuation of\n30 dB is used to illuminate an area of ;2 mm2. This gives a\nmean power density per micropulse of 5 kW cm22. The\npower density during a macropulse is 20 W cm2. This is a\nconsiderable amount of power and could result in significant\nheating of the carriers, which we estimate by comparison\nwith the temperature-dependent PL study of Alphande\u00b4ry\net al.2 to generate temperatures approaching 40 K. Both elec-\ntrons and holes are redistributed back to higher-energy dots\nwith higher confinement energies and smaller localization\nenergies. This results in reduced levels of dot photolumines-\ncence as the electrons can leave the dots and spend more\ntime in the wetting layer and the bulk material, enhancing the\ncompeting recombination routes as shown schematically in\nFig. 2~b!. In the case of the GaAs substrate sample A where\nnonradiative recombination is dominant this leads to an over-\nall decrease in the PL signal, whereas for sample B with the\nGaSb substrate, there is a corresponding increase in the re-7-2\nFAR-INFRARED MODULATED PHOTOLUMINESCENCE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW B 68, 165307 ~2003!sponse from the WL and substrate peaks as shown in Fig. 3.\nThis would also lead to an increase in the mean energy of the\noccupied dots, biasing the FIRM-PL towards higher energy.\nThis is thought to be the explanation for the persistence of\nthe positive FIRM-PL signal up to slightly higher FIR inten-\nsity levels.\nB. Frequency dependence\nIn order to study the spectral response of the FIRM-PL a\nseries of experiments was performed using sample B in\nwhich the FIR energy was swept in order to study the quan-\ntum dot energy levels. The disadvantage of sweeping FELIX,\nparticularly over a large bandwidth, is that over time the\npower may vary. This means that it is necessary to normalize\nthe FIRM-PL data with respect to the power of FELIX at\neach given energy. In principle this can be achieved using\none of three different methods. The first is to measure the\ninitial FELIX power output within the beam line. The second\nis to measure the power density arriving directly at the cry-\nostat windows. The third method is to use an internal cali-\nbration if a reference feature can be found. This third mea-\nsure was chosen as the most accurate as it measures the\nFIG. 2.

This method could,\nhowever, only be used with sample B due to the fact that it is\ngrown on GaSb which results in enhanced signals from bulk\nGaSb features which can then be used for the normalization\nprocess.\nFigure 3 shows the PL response of sample B. The quan-\ntum dot transition is at 0.73 eV ~Ref. 1! with the wetting\nlayer ~WL! the or bulk acceptor B state being visible at 0.757\neV.12 There is a strong signal from the bulk acceptor A state\nat 0.777 eV which was used as the reference feature to mea-\nsure the incident FIR power.12 As this state is sufficiently\nstrongly bound not to show any resonant transitions in the\nFIR energy range used, it is expected that this feature can act\nas an accurate internal pyrometer. This assumption was\nchecked by using an in-line power meter in the wavelength\nrange 80\u2013150 mm. A weaker peak at 0.793 eV ~BE4! origi-\nnates from an acceptor bound exciton.12\nThe experiment was performed in the FIR high power\nlimit in order to ensure sufficient signal at all wavelengths.\nThus the effect of the FIR on the quantum dots was to reduce\nthe overall level of the dot photoluminescence as indicated\nby a negative FIRM-PL peak, with a corresponding increase\nbeing observed in the wetting layer and bulk GaSb features.\nFigure 3 illustrates how the amplitude of the FIRM-PL signal\nof the quantum dot feature has a much stronger dependence\non the FIR energy than that of the GaSb bulk features. It is\ntherefore proposed that the FIR is inducing a resonant exci-\nFIG. 3. Upper section shows photoluminescence ~PL! data of\nsample B.

The excited states in the dots lie\nmuch closer in energy to the WL and bulk GaSb and there-\nfore have a higher probability of reionization before recom-\nbination occurs.\nThe resonant nature of the FIR response can be seen\nclearly when the normalized FIRM-PL response ~the ratio of\nthe quantum dot MPL peak to that of the bulk acceptor! is\nplotted in Fig. 4. There is a strong feature which peaks at\n;14.5 meV. We propose that this spectrum is a direct mea-\nsure of the distribution of quantum dot excitation energies\nfor occupied dots, measured in the high-temperature limit.\nFor a simple harmonic confinement potential this will be the\nsame as the distribution of dot confinement energies \\Vdot .\nSuch a distribution is entirely consistent with the picture de-\nduced by Alphande\u00b4ry et al.2 who demonstrated using magne-\ntophotoluminescence experiments on InSb\/GaSb quantum\ndots, as a function of temperature and power, that a range of\ndots exist whose lateral confinement energies \\Vdot vary\nsignificantly.2 In the low excitation power, low-temperature\nregime the average confinement energy of populated dots,\n\\Vdot , was found to be ;6 meV. When significantly larger\nexcitation laser powers were used, the mean energy of the\noccupied dots was found to shift significantly to higher en-\nergy with a corresponding increase in \\Vdot up to ;14 meV\nbeing observed.2\nAn example of the excitation power dependence of the PL\nis shown for sample B in Fig. 5, where a shift of ;10 meV\nin the dot transition energy with excitation power was ob-\nserved. This would correspond to the difference between the\npreferential population at low temperature of large dots, and\nthe uniform population of the quantum dot distribution\nbrought about by a high temperature or high intensity. The\npeak observed at 14.5 meV in Fig. 4 is consistent with the\nchange in mean dot binding energies discussed above, while\nthe width of the high intensity quantum dot PL in Fig. 5 is\nconsistent with a range of confinement energies of order 20\nmeV. The broad peak in the FIRM-PL is consistent with the\nfact that no higher energy peak, or excited states, has been\nresolved in PL for either high power interband excitation or\nwith FIR modulation. The significant distribution of dot en-\nFIG. 4. Ratio of the amplitudes of the MPL features at the emis-\nsion energies corresponding to the quantum dots and bulk GaSb.16530ergies results in a substantial overlap of the excited states\nfrom larger dots with the ground state of smaller, high-\nenergy dots thus smearing out the total PL signal.\nThe asymmetry of the spectrum in Fig. 4 is quite striking,\nwith a rapid decrease in normalized FIRM-PL beyond 14\u201315\nmeV as the magnitude drops off to levels close to zero. This\nsuggests that there must be a lower limit to the dot size.\nTaking the upper limit for the in-plane confinement energy to\nbe ;22 meV from Fig. 4 and assuming an effective mass2 of\n0.035mo , the lateral extent of the peak in the distribution can\nbe estimated as ;25 nm and the smallest dots are ;20 nm.\nThis is in good agreement with the estimates made in Ref. 2.\nA further contributing factor to the asymmetry of the distri-\nbution is that although we estimate the electron temperature\nto be of the order of 40 K, this is not sufficiently high to\ncause a uniform distribution amongst the dots and will cause\na significant preferential population of the lower confinement\nenergy dots.\nA further contributing factor to the falloff in response is\nlikely to be the overlap of the excited states with the wetting\nlayer. It is known in quantum wells that the strength of\nbound to continuum transitions decreases as the bound level\napproaches the barrier.13 The difference between the inter-\nband transition energies of the wetting layer and the ~low\nintensity! dot ground state is of the order of 33 meV. As the\ndistribution of band offsets in this system is approximately\nequal in the valence and conduction bands it is expected that\nthe energy difference of their conduction-band energies\nwould be of the order of 16 meV. For dots with excitation\nenergies above this the excited state will be resonant with the\nwetting layer which will cause a further decrease in the tran-\nsition probability due to the decreased overlap of the wave\nfunctions. The results of Sauvage et al.9 on photoinduced\nabsorption indicate that for a sample with a broad distribu-\ntion of ground-state energies, excited-state transitions domi-\nnate in the high-temperature limit and transitions to the wet-\nting layer can only be detected in the low-temperature limit\nwhen the excited-state transitions are suppressed. The\nFIRM-PL measurements reported here are all performed in\nFIG. 5. The effect of the incident power on the PL of the quan-\ntum dots in sample B.

This observation is also\nconsistent with the observations from the low intensity PL\nmeasurements2 that the dominant confinement energy is only\n;6 meV.\nIV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nFIRM-PL measurements in InSb\/GaSb quantum dots have\nbeen performed using a free-electron laser as the FIR source.\nThe power density of the FIR on the sample was important\nand can be described by two regimes. In the low power limit\nthe FIR modifies the nonthermal distribution of carriers in\nthe dots by exciting transitions to excited states with a lower\nlocalization energy and allowing the population of large,16530low-energy dots. The second, high power limit results in a\nsignificant increase in the overall carrier temperature, with\nthe electrons escaping from the large dots. A decrease in the\ndot photoluminescence was observed in this regime while\nthe wetting layer FIRM signal increased.\nThe spectral dependence of the FIRM-PL signal was mea-\nsured at high FIR powers and shows that there is an asym-\nmetric distribution of occupied quantum dots with a peak\nexcitation energy of around 14.5 meV.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support by the Stichting\nvoor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie ~FOM! in pro-\nviding the required beam time on FELIX and highly appre-\nciate the skilful assistance by the FELIX staff.
