In traditional computer sys-\ntems, users interact with the computer-based environment from out-\nside the environment itself. However, virtual environments provide\na situation where the user can be immersed, physically and possibly\nmentally [17], within the environment. Although some elements of\nthe environment may be well-defined, for example physical layout,\nother aspects are more troublesome, for example the organisation\nand presentation of interaction cues and capabilities. The location\nof information, either represented externally in a computer system\nor internally by the user, may have wide-ranging effects on a sys-\ntems usability [16, 25].\nThe view of information as being either external or internal to\nthe user is extremely important for virtual environment design. As\ntypical environments are a blend of the user\u2019s senses, the virtual\nenvironment and the enabling technology, the location of informa-\ntion resources between the user and the system is blurred. Virtual\nenvironments commonly aim to provide an environment where the\nuser\u2019s interaction with this environment is done transparently to any\ntechnology-based devices [20]. The user is not interacting \u201cthrough\nthe interface\u201d [1] but is part of the interface. Hence, there is a direct\nneed to consider where the responsibility, the user or the system,\n\u2217e-mail: shamus.smith@durham.ac.uk\n\u2020e-mail: jhartuk@gmail.com\nlies to manage particular information resources in a virtual environ-\nment.\nThe identification of this responsibility management is a key el-\nement in the design of successful virtual environments. This paper\ninvestigates the location of information resources distributed in the\nhuman-computer cognitive system for the commonest virtual envi-\nronment interaction, namely navigation. The distributed informa-\ntion resources model (or resources model for short) [25] is consid-\nered as a starting point for the cognitive analysis of virtual environ-\nment navigation. Several configurations of navigational aids based\non the resources model are demonstrated and evaluated for cogni-\ntive load.\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2\nconsiders related work on navigation aids while section 3 exam-\nines background material on (i) the general distributed cognition\napproach, (ii) a specific resource-based framework and (iii) the im-\nplications for design. Section 4 describes the interaction area of\ninterest, namely navigation and how it can be represented as dis-\ntributed resources. Several wayfinding aids have been developed\n(section 5) and an initial user study has been completed (section 6).\nIn section 7 the results of the user study are presented and discussed\nin section 8. The conclusions are presented in section 9.\n2 RELATED WORK\nNavigation in virtual environments can be supported by the inclu-\nsion of explicit aid mechanisms, as demonstrated in this paper, or\nby changing the nature of the environment itself. An example of\nthe later can be seen in [21]. Design guidelines for environment\ndefinition, based on cinematography conventions, were developed\nto reduce user disorientation when navigating in a virtual environ-\nment. The environment is augmented with features to increase the\nuser\u2019s awareness of off-screen space. User studies demonstrated\nhow the use of the design guidelines reduced disorientation when\nnavigating [21].\nNavigation aids can be designed to support or simplify plans for\nfuture action, i.e. wayfinding, and the execution of these plans, i.e.\ntravel. Paelke [13] describes a systematic approach to the develop-\nment of new navigation aids. Scenarios and the definition of a pro-\nposed actor metaphor are used to communicate and define a speci-\nfication for new navigation aids. The approach is demonstrated in\nthe development of animated pets that provide navigation support at\nkey locations in a virtual city. The approach focuses on producing\nan accurate first-prototype to guide further refinement and evalua-\ntion. Similar to the aids discussed in this paper, the pet guides are\nreusable across a number of environments.\nDarken and Peterson [4] present an overview of navigation in\nvirtual environments. They consider how understanding how peo-\nple navigate can affect the design of virtual environment applica-\ntions. A number of navigation tools are discussed including maps,\nlandmarks, trails and direction finding mechanisms. Several de-\nsign principles for the design of navigable virtual environments are\ndescribed that focus on providing the user with enough spatial in-\nformation so that users can execute navigation tasks as demanded\nby the application without overconstraining the interface [4]. The\nuse of the resources model in this paper provides a framework to\nevaluate where in the interface this source of spatial information\nis and where it might be re-allocated in order to support particular\nnavigation tasks.\nWhether multiple external navigational aids provide better sup-\nport for users is an issue considered in [15]. A number of nav-\nigational tools were evaluated in order to determine if the visual\npresentation of navigational aids improves navigation performance,\nin terms of the time to complete a searching task. A user study\nconfirmed the positive effects of navigational aids and that the pres-\nence of a number of visual tools improves performance more sig-\nnificantly than any individual tool. However, their study did not\nstrongly differentiate between the usefulness of individual naviga-\ntional aids, discussed here in section 8.\nAn example of combining internal navigation aids is described\nin [14]. Combinations of trails and landmarks were evaluated with\na searching task in first-time and subsequent navigation. Overall,\nparticipants searched more efficiently when a trail was provided.\nHowever, there were issues with trail pollution, the visual clutter\nproduced by a number of trails being laid over time, which made it\ndifficult for users to determine a primary trail. This is similar the\nexperiences with concurrent path representation described in this\npaper.\n3 BACKGROUND\n3.1 Distributed cognition\nDistributed cognition (DC) is a hybrid approach to studying all as-\npects of cognition, from a cognitive, social and organisational per-\nspective [25]. The DC position is that the appropriate unit of anal-\nysis is not an individual but rather a distributed cognitive system of\npeople and artifacts. The means by which this distributed system\nis studied is by analysis of the way in which distributed representa-\ntions are co-ordinated, propagated and transformed. By analysing\nthis process of representation and re-representation it is possible to\naccount for how tasks of humans in the system are transformed and\nmade more or less difficult [19].\nFor modelling human-computer interaction, the DC paradigm\nhas some obvious attractions. It might be used to understand how\nproperties of objects on the screen can serve as external represen-\ntations and reduce cognitive effort [16]. The deliberate softening\nof the boundary between the user and system inherent in the dis-\ntributed cognition view also brings into focus the design question\nof the information requirements for interaction. For example, what\ninformation is required in order to carry out some task and where\nshould it be located? Should it be as an interface object or as some-\nthing that is mentally represented by the user? In support of the DC\napproach is that it provides a framework and analytic methodology\nfor examining the interactions between people and artifacts which is\nnot possible with traditional approaches to cognitive analyses [25].\n3.2 Distributed cognition for design\nDistributed cognition, as an approach, makes a valuable contribu-\ntion to design because it leads us to re-examine the relations be-\ntween actors, artifacts and the settings in which interaction occurs.\nBy identifying information structures or representations flowing\nthrough functional systems as objects of analysis, it becomes pos-\nsible to reason, not only about design artifacts, but also cognitive\nartifacts, within a single framework [25].\nScaife and Rogers [16] use cognition theory to inform the design\nprocess and aid the selection of appropriate graphical representa-\ntions. They analyse graphical representations as forms of external\ncognition and emphasise the importance of considering how the\nproperties of such representations can affect thinking and reason-\ning. However they do not provide an account of action or interac-\ntion [25].\nCockayne, Wright and Fields [3] note that \u201cthe distributed cog-\nnition literature [8, 9, 16, 27] has demonstrated how differences in\nthe externalisation of resources for action [22] can materially affect\nease of use and ease of learning. At times it has been harder to see\nhow to relate these findings to design decisions.\u201d\nA problem with the DC approach is that it is not a methodol-\nogy that one can readily pick off the shelf and apply to a design\nproblem [25]. This is especially problematic as the design of vir-\ntual environments is traditionally seen as a highly implementation\nbased process [18]. For example, developments typically focus on\nthe use of rapid prototyping and system refinement. However, re-\ncent virtual environment research is moving towards alternative ap-\nproaches to virtual environment development, i.e. more structured\npre-implementation design [10, 23, 24].\nAn alternative to the general theory provided by DC is to con-\nsider an approach based on similar concepts but more applicable\nto virtual environment design. One such alternative is the resources\nmodel [25]. One of the main features of the resources model is in its\nfocus on interaction between entities within a cognitive system. As\ncomplex, and\/or realistic, interaction is one of the defining aspects\nof many virtual environments, this is a promising start to cognitive\nmodelling for virtual environments.\n3.3 The resources model\nThe resources model is comprised of two components; abstract in-\nformation structures and interaction strategies. Wright, Fields and\nHarrison [8, 25] identify six abstract information structures that can\nbe used to classify the types of information that inform interaction;\nplans, specifying actions to be performed; goals and sub-goals to be\nachieved; the current state of the world or interactive system; his-\ntorical information or interaction history about previous actions and\nwhat properties held of the state in the past; an action-effect model\nof the effect actions have on the system; and the set of affordances\nthat the system currently supports. These structures can be grouped\nto make up a resource configuration. A resource configuration is\na collection of information structures that can be defined for each\nstep in an interaction and which can be used to inform action [25].\nThese resources can either be external in an interface or repre-\nsented in the head of the user. When action is taken in an environ-\nment there is a change in the resource configuration. For example,\nthe current state and the history structures may change. An inter-\naction sequence can thus be seen as a number of steps between\nchanging resource configurations.\nThe second part of the resources model is the interaction strate-\ngies. Interaction strategies are the linkages between resource con-\nfigurations that can be used to make decisions about what ac-\ntion to take. Wright, Fields and Harrison [25] define four strate-\ngies; plan following, plan construction, goal matching and history-\nbased selection\/elimination. Plan following involves the user in co-\nordinating a pre-computed plan with the history of action so far un-\ndertaken. In its simplest form the plan is followed by determining\nthe next action on the list until the list is exhausted. Plan construc-\ntion requires the user to compare the current state of the world with\nsome goal and to select from possible next actions those that reduce\nthe difference between the two states. This process may need to be\ndone iteratively on future states and affordances. The output of this\nprocess is a plan. A goal matching strategy is when affordances\nvisible in an environment are used to control a search for the next\naction that matches, or moves closer to, a goal. History-based se-\nlection and elimination is similar to goal matching, only that the\ninteraction history, not the action effect, is used for the selection of\nthe next action.\nStrategy Resources required\nplan following plan, history and current state\nplan construction goal, affordances, action-effect and\ncurrent state\ngoal matching goal, affordances and action-effects\nhistory-based choice goal, affordances and history\nTable 1: Strategies and the resources they require.\nInteraction strategies presuppose certain configurations of re-\nsources to make them effective and conversely, how a configuration\nof resources can make a particular interaction strategy possible [25].\nThis is summarised in Table 1. By making the organisation of infor-\nmation explicit, the model facilitates reasoning, analysis and com-\nparison.\n3.4 Resources model for virtual environment design\nIn general, an abstract information resource can be represented or\nimplemented by any of the human or machine agents in a cognitive\nsystem [8]. The benefits of this type of model is that it allows a de-\nsigner to allocate information resources to the system and helps an\nanalyst discover problematic points in a design by identifying how\ntask-critical information structures are distributed around a system,\nand how the user is able to gain access to them [25].\nThe resources model has proved useful in framing analysis of in-\nteraction in terms of distributed cognition [25]. Firstly, as a means\nof comparing different interface designs, secondly, as a means of\nanalysing interaction and thirdly, as a way of generating design al-\nternatives and analysing their effects on user performance. Smith,\nDuke and Wright [19] describe the use of a distributive cognition\napproach using the resources model to help analyse information re-\nsources in virtual environment design. They presented four exam-\nples of how the resources model can be used in the virtual environ-\nment design process.\n1. Designing interaction episodes can help identify where the\nscarcity of externalised resources places heavy demands on\nthe user\u2019s knowledge.\n2. Device classification allows a better match between physical\ndevices and logical devices and allows designers to identify\nmissing device functionality early in the design process.\n3. By matching the veracity of tasks to the available resources,\nthe final implementation can provide the level of interaction\nrequired for the current task.\n4. The externalisation of plans in virtual environments can aid in\nreducing the users cognitive load, for example when navigat-\ning in a virtual environment.\nThis paper revisits the externalisation of plans in virtual environ-\nments and investigates several aids to support a wayfinding task.\n4 NAVIGATION, WAYFINDING AND A VIRTUAL TOURIST\nAt this stage, we should clarify some terms. We consider the pro-\ncess of moving through an environment as motion, or travel [2, pg\n183]. This is a combination of orientation and translation move-\nments by the user. The act of navigation is the meaningful travel\nthrough an environment typically as the operation of a targeted\nsearch, e.g. the user has a destination in mind. Bowman et. al. [2,\npg 227] describe wayfinding as the cognitive process of defining a\npath through an environment, using and acquiring spatial knowl-\nedge aided by both natural and artificial cues. Darken and Peter-\nson [4] observe that navigation is an aggregate task of wayfinding\nand motion and must have both a cognitive element (wayfinding)\nand a motoric element (motion).\nThe problem domain used in this paper is the difficulty involved\nin a virtual tourist navigating for the first time in a virtual environ-\nment while searching for a set of landmarks. Navigation in such vir-\ntual environments is difficult, especially in large virtual worlds [5].\nContributing factors to this are the lack of veracity in the presen-\ntation and utilisation of navigation metaphors, problems with in-\nteraction hardware and cognitive load that is placed on the user.\nAlso travellers visiting large virtual environments for the first time\nare easily disoriented, may have difficulty identifying a place upon\narrival and may not be able to find their way back to a place just\nvisited [7]. When navigating, unless the user has a good knowledge\nof the environment, they are unlikely to build complex plans before\nstarting navigation. Virtual environment navigators may wander\naimlessly when attempting to find a place for the first time [5].\n4.1 Navigation and the resources model\nTypically navigation is based on locally obtained information, for\nexample the current state of the environment, externalised in the\nvisual representation, and the goal of the navigation and knowledge\nof the navigation technique, both internalised in the mind of the\nuser. The user then continues with a mixture of goal matching and\nhistory-based choice interaction strategies. In goal matching the\nuser decides what to do in a localised way by matching the effects\nof an action to the current goal and checking if the current system\nstate satisfies the goal [25]. For example, setting local sub-goals,\ne.g. \u201cI should move forward\u201d, to see if this gets them closer to the\noverall goal. With history-based choice, the interaction history is\nused, with the current possible actions, to determine the next course\nof action. For example, if the user has navigated forward into a wall,\nthe history, i.e. \u201cmove forward\u201d, can be used to eliminate another\n\u201cmove forward\u201d action and select an alternative action.\nBoth these strategies, when applied to navigation, only provide\nlocalised decision-making and may require the user to extensively\nexplore a virtual environment, building their own mental spatial\nmodel, before either reaching their goal, through trial and error,\nor building internalised plans to reach currently unexplored areas.\nThe additional cognitive processing required for perception of the\nvirtual environment and the navigation actions can tie up cognitive\nprocessing resources, reducing the effective deployment of higher\nlevel cognitive processing functions [12]. Depending on the spatial\nabilities of the user, and the veracity of the environment, users can\neasily become lost, disoriented and unmotivated.\nAn alternative to localised action selection is to apply a plan fol-\nlowing strategy. Plan following is an interaction strategy that in-\nvolves the user co-ordinating a pre-computed plan with the history\nof action so far taken, and, optionally, with the current goal [25].\nHowever, a pre-computed plan is central to the plan following strat-\negy.\nFigure 1 shows an overview for navigation in a virtual environ-\nment where a user follows a generated route\/plan from a current\nposition to a destination. Before the user starts to navigate, the fol-\nlowing is the current resource configuration.\n\u2022 Goal: Destination (user).\n\u2022 Current State: Current environment (system), spatial knowl-\nedge (user).\n\u2022 Affordances : Navigation method (environment).\n\u2022 Action-effect: Result of navigation method (user).\nEvaluate progress\nStop\nAt destination\nRoute not ok Route ok\nPlan route\nTravel route\nDestination selection\nFigure 1: Navigation overview.\nThere is an assumption that the user has mastery over the inter-\naction technique that is being used to enable navigation, e.g. travel\nroute of Figure 1. This includes the possible actions that are avail-\nable in terms of this interaction, i.e. the affordances, and the effect\nthat this interaction will have on the current state and history re-\nsources, i.e. via the action-effects. This is in terms of the direct\ninteraction only. The user does not have access to knowledge about\nthe action-effect in terms of changing their location in regard to\ntheir position in the environment i.e. extending their spatial knowl-\nedge of the environment. For the task domain in this paper, the user\nis intending to do a naive search [5]. This is any searching task in\nwhich the navigator has no priori knowledge of the whereabouts of\nthe target in question. A naive search implies that an exhaustive\nsearch must be performed [5].\nThe process described in Figure 1 blocks when the user tries\nto plan a route. Without access to spatial or survey knowledge,\nconfigurational or topological knowledge [5], of the environment,\nthe user does not have the affordance\/action-effect information re-\nsources needed to plan a route. Therefore the resource configu-\nration of the environment needs to be changed or altered to allow\nthe user to be able to plan a route to the target destination. How-\never, artificial aids in virtual environments can do more than help\nthe user plan routes, they can shift some of the cognitive processing\nthat plan construction and plan following involves away from the\nuser. Five wayfinding aids based on the resources model have been\ndeveloped and evaluated.\n5 WAYFINDING AIDS\nWayfinding is something humans do, and take for granted, on a\nday to day basis. However, techniques used in the real world of-\nten translate poorly when navigating in virtual environments. Such\nenvironments commonly lack cues used in reality, for example dis-\ntance travelled can be estimated by noting fatigue over time or travel\nspeed can be determined by whether a person is walking or running.\nIn addition, in new environments searching for specific locations\ncan be difficult and slow and in complex environments users may\nbecome disorientated or lost.\nIn real world navigation and searching tasks, the use of wayfind-\ning aids is common, for example the use of maps, compasses and\nsign posts to act as artificial landmarks. Such aids have also been\nutilised to aid virtual environment wayfinding and navigation (see\nfor example [2, 4, 13, 14, 15]). However, many of these exam-\nples are attempting to benefit from the users previous knowledge\nof such aids [20]. What is less clear is the cognitive benefit that\nsuch aids provide. These aids change the resource configuration of\nthe human-computer system and may in fact increase the cognitive\nload on the user.\nIn the next sections five resource-based wayfinding aids are de-\nscribed and predictions on how they will alter the cognitive load\nwhen used to aid navigation are generated. This is not an exhaus-\ntive set of wayfinding aids. The aids will be described in context of\nsearching for a set of landmarks in a desktop virtual environment.\nAll but one of the aids have been implemented as a 2D interface\nexternal to the 3D environment that is being navigated.\n5.1 Distance only\nThe user is simply given the distance to a selected landmark as an\ninteger (see Figure 2). It is predicted that this aid will place a large\ncognitive load on the user as they will have to interpret the direction\nthey need to travel in as the distance to the landmark increases or\ndecreases requiring coordination of the interaction history resource.\nThe user will be required to remember their movement history im-\nplicitly in order to benefit from the distance information. The dis-\ntance only aid fulfils the goal, displayed in the interface, and action-\neffect, as the indicated distance changes, of the resources model.\nFigure 2: Distance only interface.\n5.2 Graphical compass\nThe graphical compass is a standard compass interface that has four\nconcurrent pointers; red pointing north, and blue, green, yellow\npointers being user allocated to environment landmarks (see Fig-\nure 3). The cognitive load on the user should be low as the compass\nexplicitly displays the direction to each landmarks but, as Bowman\net al. [2, pg 247] observe, most users of 3D user interfaces will\nnot be familiar with effective methods for using compass informa-\ntion, thus a medium cognitive load level is predicted. The graph-\nical compass fulfils the goal, displayed in the interface, the affor-\ndance, with the compass points indicating directions to travel and\naction-effect, as the direction pointers dynamically change, of the\nresources model.\nFigure 3: Graphical compass interface.\n5.3 Dead reckoning\nThis method uses a simple text message to indicate the required\nmovement to the highlighted landmark, for example one of four\ndescriptions ; ahead, left, right and behind (see Figure 4). The text\nmessage is generated from the users current facing to a selected\nlandmark (see Figure 5). The user will also be given the distance to\nthe selected landmark. This method aims to have a low cognitive\nload on the user as it gives a rough indication of the next travel\nrequirement. The dead reckoning aid fulfils the goal, displayed in\nthe interface, action-effect, as the dead reckoning text is updated\nas the user moves and the distance changes, and the affordance by\nindicating the direction to travel.\nFigure 4: Dead reckoning interface.\nFigure 5: Angles for dead reckoning allocation.\n5.4 Map-based route planning\nThis wayfinding aid requires the user to select the landmarks they\nwish to visit from an onscreen map before exploring the virtual en-\nvironment. The user examines a 2D map of the environment and\nplaces markers, or waypoints, that they wish to visit (see left side\nof Figure 6). Once all the waypoints have been set, the user en-\nters the 3D virtual environment and is guided along the route by a\nsingle point direction compass and distance measure (see right side\nof Figure 6). With the pre-planning stage of this aid, it is hoped\nthat user will internalise some of the spatial information for their\nroute that will be reinforced, once in the environment, by the 2D\ninterface. Therefore it is predicted that it will significantly aid the\nuser and reduce their cognitive load. The map-based route plan-\nning fulfils the goal, displayed in the interface, plan, presented in\nthe saved landmark route, and action-effect, as the direction pointer\ndynamically changes, of the resources model.\n5.5 Graphical plan following\nThis wayfinding aid inserts a path into the virtual environment,\nwhich the user can follow from landmark to landmark. The paths\nare semi-transparent tubes which stretch between landmarks above\nground level and above head height (see Figure 7 with a path\nleading to a pyramid landmark). The paths can be considered as\ntrails [2, pg 249] that provide direction information. This should\nhave a low cognitive load on the user as they just have to follow\nthe path between landmarks. The graphical plan following fulfils\nFigure 6: Map-based route planning interface.\nthe plan resource as the pre-calculated path, encapsulating the re-\nsources from plan construction (see Table 1).\nFigure 7: Graphical plan following example.\n6 STUDY OUTLINE\nA user study with six users was conducted to evaluate the wayfind-\ning aids. The study group was required to take on the role of a\nvirtual tourist and were asked to visit five landmarks in a desktop\nvirtual environment. There was no set order in which the users must\nvisit the landmarks and the virtual environment was developed so\nthat the users would have no prior knowledge of the particular task\nenvironment. This ensured that their navigation was dependent on\nthe currently provided wayfinding aid.\nThe experiment was run on a Macintosh iBook laptop running\nMac OS X. The virtual environment was a basic 3D world devel-\noped in Java3D (see Figures 7 and 8). Embodiment in the world\nwas via a first-person perspective and travel in the environment was\nenabled by using the arrow keys on a standard keyboard. Test sub-\njects were located in an isolated room with one instructor\/observer\nand an audio recorder to capture any verbalisations.\nBefore starting the main task, the users were shown the controls\nused to travel in the virtual environment and were allowed to ex-\nplore an example environment so they could become familiar with\nthe travel controls and the task of finding landmarks. Two map\nconfigurations were used and each wayfinding aid was tested twice,\neach time by a different user on a different map. Each map was\ndesigned with approximately the same (i) area, (ii) density of build-\nings and (iii) landmarks (see Figure 9 for a plan view of one of the\nmaps).\nFigure 8: Durham cathedral landmark in the virtual environment.\nFigure 9: Example environment plan view.\nThe cooperative evaluation technique was used to encourage\nusers to detail their experience while completing the landmark\nsearching task.\n6.1 Cooperative evaluation\nThe cognitive load placed on a user whilst navigating is subjective\nand is therefore difficult to measure directly or quantify. Traditional\ninformation gathering methods such as post-session interviews and\nquestionnaires can lead to biased results if subjects misremember\ntheir experiences. This has been a recurrent issue when measuring\nsubjective experiences such as immersion and presence in virtual\nenvironments [17]. One alternative is to invite subjects to verbalise\ntheir experience as they have it, i.e. using a think aloud protocol [6,\npg 343], during the session. The verbalisations can then be captured\non audio recordings. This evaluation mechanism is not without its\nproblems because the user may (i) forget to verbalise their actions,\n(ii) feel self conscious verbalising or (iii) miss reporting features\nthat the evaluator is particularly interested in.\nWright and Monk [26] proposed an augmented form of the think\naloud protocol called cooperative evaluation. This is a concurrent\nthink aloud verbal protocol where users are encouraged to treat the\nevaluation as a shared experience with the evaluator and may ask\nquestions at any time. Also subjects may be prompted to explain\nactions as the session progresses. Similar to an in-session inter-\nview, it can provide qualitative feedback on the motivations for the\nusers current behaviour. Marsh and Wright [11] describe how the\nqualitative data from a cooperative evaluation session can be quan-\ntified. The think aloud verbalisations can be assessed according to\ntheir quantity and quality. Quantity can be determined by counting\nall the verbalisations. Quality is attained by judging the value of\neach verbalisation.\nLow quality problems are judged to be of low importance or im-\npact to the environment or task under analysis and are more likely\nto be overcome with more usage and time in the environment. High\nquality problems are judged to be of high importance to the design-\ners, and something that is not likely to be reduced by prolonged use,\ni.e. something that may shock or startle a user, for example moving\nthrough or colliding with objects. In this paper, high value will be\nassociated with usability problems that are judged to be associated\nwith the wayfinding aid under evaluation.\nCooperative evaluation has been successfully used for the evalu-\nation of usability issues in virtual environments [11, 21]. One draw-\nback of this technique is that prompting the user to talk may inter-\nrupt their train of thought and be distracting. However, Marsh and\nWright [11] found that users encountered no significant addition to\nthe time taken to complete their task whist thinking aloud as when\nnot.\nIn this study, quantifying the in-session usability problems will\nprovide a measure of the cognitive load that is placed on the user\nby the different wayfinding aids.\n7 RESULTS\nAfter the sessions, the evaluator\u2019s notes and the audio recordings\nwere used to classify any verbalisations by the users into nine in-\ndicators of cognitive load, namely, (i) collisions with buildings in\nthe environment, (ii) attempts to leave the environment bounds, (iii)\nbeing disorientation, (iv) confusion with the travel controls, (v) con-\nfusion with using the wayfinding controls, (vi) confusion with the\nwayfinding aid directions, (vii) being lost in the environment, (viii)\nproblems with the task and (ix) any other questions. In total the\nusers provided 38 verbalisations related to the indicators during the\nsessions and of these verbalisations, 12 (32%) were exteriorised\nfollowing evaluator questions.\nA summary of the results can be seen in Table 2. Down the left\nhand column are the nine indicators of cognitive load. Along the\ntop of Table 2 are the five wayfinding aids. From Table 2 the num-\nber of verbalisations can be quantified (i) per indicator and (ii) per\nwayfinding aid. Indicated in each table cell is a judgement, by the\nauthors, of whether the verbalisation was of low (L) or high (H)\nvalue in comparing the wayfinding aids. An \u201cE\u201d indicates that the\nverbalisation was exteriorised following a question from the evalu-\nator to the user.\nThe cooperative evaluation provides data in terms of quantity\nof verbalisations and a classification of quality, indicated as high\nor low ratings by the evaluator. In order to highlight the impact\nvalue of high quality verbalisations the totals in Table 2 have been\naugmented with weights where high quality verbalisations are twice\nas important as low quality verbalisations.\nIn terms of the indicators of cognitive load, the greatest number\nof verbalisations involved confusion over the directions provided\nby the wayfinding aids (11 weighted verbalisations). This was fol-\nlowed by verbalisations about collisions with objects, i.e. build-\nings, in the 3D environment, and confusion with the wayfinding\ncontrols. No users had problems with the environment travel con-\ntrols and only minor issues with getting lost in the environment or\nother, unspecific, issues.\nOf the wayfinding techniques, the graphical compass and the\ngraphical plan following prompted the most verbalisations, while\nthe dead reckoning aid prompted the least.\nUsability problem \/ Distance Graphical Dead Map-based Graphical Number With weights\nWayfinding aid only compass reckoning route plan of times (L\u22171+H \u22172)\nplanning following verbalised\nCollision with environment L, L L, L L, L H, L L 9 (8L,1H) 10\nAttempts to leave map bounds 0 L, L 0 0 L 3 (3L) 3\nDisorientation L L 0 LE L 4 (3L,1LE) 4\nConfusion with travel controls 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nConfusion with using L,LE, 0 0 LE,HE LE, HE 7 (4LE, 9\nwayfinding controls LE 2HE, 1L)\nConfusion with 0 H,HE 0 L,LE L,HE, 7 (3HE,2L 11\nwayfinding directions HE 1H, 1LE)\nLost L 0 0 0 0 1 (1L) 1\nOther question 0 LE 0 0 0 1 (1LE) 1\nProblem with task 0 H,L L,L L L 6 (5L,1H) 7\nTotal 7 (2LE,5L) 10 (6L,2H, 4 (4L) 8 (3LE,3L, 9 (5L,3HE, 38 (23L,7LE, -\n1HE,1LE) 1HE,1H) 1LE) 5HE,3H)\nWith weights (L\u22171+H \u22172) 7 13 4 10 12 - -\nTable 2: Reduction of think-aloud usability verbalisations to cognitive load indicators (L = low quality, H = high quality, E = exteriorised\nfollowing evaluators question).\n8 DISCUSSION\nThe user study evaluated how the different wayfinding aids reduced\nor increased the cognitive load, measured as usability problems,\non the user while they navigated around an environment searching\nfor landmarks. To generate a general cognitive load classification,\ne.g. low, medium or high, for each wayfinding aid the weighted\nresults were examined. This classification was compared with the\npredicted load for each wayfinding aid (see Section 5). A summary\nof the predicted and evaluated cognitive loads can be see in Table 3.\nThe distance only aid was well received by the users. Its use\nwas quickly determined by the users. Collisions with the environ-\nment happened as the aid only provided direct distances and re-\nquired users to navigate around other buildings in the environment\nto reach each landmark. The expected high load on the users in\nintegrating distances to interaction history did not manifest itself\nwith the main issues being with the wayfinding aid controls i.e. the\npull-down menus for landmark selection.\nThe graphical compass confused users and they required further\ndirection on its use. At each new travel movement every compass\npoint moved, indicating the direction to the assigned landmark. The\nconstantly changing points caused the users to have difficultly in\ncoordinating the next travel movement to a particular landmark. It\nmay have been helpful if the compass needles of landmarks already\nvisited were removed, hence reducing the concurrent goal resources\nin previous and future landmark searches.\nThe dead reckoning aid provided support as predicted and users\nfound the general guiding provided adequate. The only verbalisa-\ntions were about collisions with buildings in the environment and\nhow to complete the task. Both would be reduced with further prac-\ntice in the environment and are not explicitly related to the wayfind-\ning aid.\nThe majority of the problems with map-based route planning in-\nvolved its use in the searching task. Users had few problems setting\nwaypoints on the 2D map. However, once in the 3D environment,\nthere were issues with coordinating the pre-planned path and how\nthis was supported by the wayfinding interface. Users were required\nto manually select the next waypoint in the interface from a pull-\ndown menu. This broke their attention with the wayfinding task as\nthey were forced at each step to re-coordinate the current goal and\nthe distance and direction, action-effect resources, provided by the\nwayfinding aid. Thus the pre-session and in-session components of\nthe aid increased the user\u2019s cognitive load.\nWayfinding method Expected Evaluated\ncognitive load cognitive load\nDistance only High Medium\nGraphical compass Medium High\nDead reckoning Low Low\nMap-based route planning Low High\nGraphical plan following Low High\nTable 3: Expected versus evaluated cognitive loads of each wayfind-\ning aid.\nFor the graphical plan following it was predicted that the users\nwould have few problems coordinating the plan provided by the\npath with their landmark goals. However, the users indicated three\nmain problems. Firstly the paths would disappear through build-\nings. It was not clear to some users of whether these buildings\nwere the landmark in question or the path continued on the other\nside. Thus they were required to navigate to the other side of the\nbuilding to reorientate themselves. Secondly, all the paths were\ndisplayed concurrently and thus at path crossroads it was difficult\nto distinguish paths between different landmarks. This is similar\nto the trail pollution observed by Ruddle [14]. In this situation the\nplan resource and the internalised affordances, represented by the\npaths, was poorly coordinated with the landmark goals. Finally, the\npaths gave no indication of the distance to the landmark or in which\ndirection to travel along the path (also noted in [4]). This was evi-\ndent in the results by high quality verbalisations in reference to the\nwayfinding direction provided by the aid.\nFour factors have been identified that may have contributed to\nthe mismatch between the predicted results and those found in the\nuser study. Firstly the predicated impact of the resource allocation\nto cognitive load may have been optimistic. This was influenced by\na desire reduce the users cognitive load by moving resources to the\nartifact, in this case the wayfinding aids. In many cases the need\nfor the user to coordinate resources explicitly represented in the\nwayfinding aid caused confusion, for example the multiple compass\npoints in the graphical compass.\nSecondly the implementation of the wayfinding aids may require\nmore fine tuning. For the graphical path following, externalising the\nplan resource as the multiple paths overwhelmed the plan following\nstrategy of the user. Representing the paths as distinct plans, e.g.\nin different colours or styles, may help the user coordinate their\ncurrent goal with the plan offered by the environment.\nThirdly, the study presented in this paper was exploratory in na-\nture and the number of participants was limited. Although care\nwas taken in the distribution of users to maps and wayfinding aids,\nit is likely that a larger user population would generate data to\nmake stronger claims on the predictive qualities of a resource model\nbased analysis in general and of the wayfinding aids in particular.\nFinally, usability problems, as identified in the cooperative eval-\nuation, were used as indicators of cognitive load. This provided\none measure for comparing the wayfinding aids. Darken and Pe-\nterson [4] observe that other measures for wayfinding performance\nare (i) the time taken to complete a wayfinding task and (ii) the\nspatial knowledge of the environment by the user. These measures\nare complementary and the data could be collected in-session, for\nexample with a background process collecting timing information\nwhile a cooperative evaluation is carried out, and post-session with\na spatial awareness test. In a follow-up study all three measures\ncould provide alternative dimensions to comparing the wayfinding\naids.\n9 CONCLUSIONS\nAs virtual environments become increasingly realistic it is impor-\ntant to identify the location and configuration of information re-\nsources, as distributed in the human-computer system, to support\nany required activities. An awareness of information resource avail-\nability and distribution can aid decision making when 3D interface\ndevelopers are considering issues such as the cognitive load on the\nuser.\nThe use of the resources model provides a framework to identify\nand communicate how information resources in an environment are\nallocated and how alternative allocations may support tasks such\nas navigation. Several wayfinding aids have been developed and\nevaluated in reference to the resource model. Cooperative evalua-\ntion has been used to identify usability problems as a measure of\ncognitive load on the users of a desktop virtual environment.\nThe results of the user study are promising. Issues with re-\nsource allocation, interface development and the wayfinding aids\nwere highlighted. However, only a small number of wayfinding aids\nwere examined with a limited number of participants. A follow-on\nstudy is planned to examine more resource model based wayfind-\ning aids, with more users and several complementary measures to\ndetermine the cognitive load on users. These measures include tim-\ning information for searching tasks, usability verbalisations from a\ncooperative evaluation and a post-session spatial awareness test.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Susanne B\u00f8dker.
