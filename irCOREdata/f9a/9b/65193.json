Based primarily on qualitative interviews with \nthe players, this paper examines some of the ways in which they construct notions of \nself, sameness and difference as young Muslim women growing up in Australia\u201fs fifth \nlargest capital city. The article is centrally concerned with the ways in which these young \nrefugee women articulate their social identities through the traditions Islam and the \nresources of western popular culture. As is argued in the following pages, the soccer \nteam provides a unique site through which to explore the politics of identity for young \nrefugee women in contemporary Australia. \n \nIntroduction \nThe embodied politics of identity that surround Muslim women\u201fs participation in sport \nand physical activity is an increasing part of our social and sociological landscape. \nStrandbrau has explored the ways in which \u201ca sense of doing something that does not fit \nwith what one believes to be moral\u201d [1] may explain the under-representation of Muslim \ngirls taking part in physical activity in Norway. Dagkas and Benn have examined the \nrestrictions posed by religious factors such as Ramadan or veiling on Muslim women\u201fs \nexperiences of playing sport in Great Britain and Greece [2]. Palmer has noted some of \nthe practical issues such as transport and cost that frequently act as barriers to \nparticipation in sport for refugee communities in Australia, which increasingly include \ngroups from Muslim countries who have re-settled in the West [3]. While Islam as a \nbarrier to participation in sport in primarily Western countries has been a focus for \nthese and other scholars, others have sought to document the nature of participation of \nsport for Muslim women in Muslim countries, noting the different conditions that \nwomen participate under, when compared to the West [4]. While the different \npositions espoused in these accounts usefully highlight the heterogeneity and fluidity of \nMuslim women vis-\u00e0-vis sport, indeed, \u201cthe bodies of Muslim women in sport are \nexperienced and mediated through different ideological interpretations of Islam [and] \nwithin the particular political arrangements of specific countries\u201d [5], they nonetheless \nemphasise that, for Muslim women, their experience of sport involves a number of \ndecisions and statements about their bodies and selves that are both personal and \npolitical at one and the same time.  \n \nWith this as background, this article explores the ways in which a group of young \nMuslim, refugee women in Adelaide, South Australia, use their shared experiences of \nplaying in a soccer team as a way of establishing and embellishing a particular cultural \nidentity that both affirms and challenges many of the traditions of Islam. Drawing on a \nseries of qualitative interviews with and many hours of field observations of the players \nat training, competition and in other social settings, this paper is particularly concerned \nto tease out some of the ways in which these young women negotiate what are, at \ntimes, quite complex cultural politics for young Muslim women growing up in Australia\u201fs \nfifth largest capital city. The paper is primarily concerned with the ways in which these \nyoung refugee women articulate their social identities through the traditions Islam and \nthe resources of western popular culture. As is made clear in the following pages, the \n 2 \nsoccer team in which these young women play provides a unique site through which to \nexplore the politics of identity for young refugee women in contemporary Australia. \nContext  \nThe fieldwork which informs this article was carried out between June 2003 and March \n2006 in a public housing estate in metropolitan Adelaide that is known as The Parks [6]. \nAs is the case elsewhere, public housing estates in Australia have increasingly become \n'problem places' that are home to 'problem people' [7]. The shift over the past two \ndecades from public housing for families and working tenants to public housing as \nwelfare housing has meant that estates like The Parks now feature amongst some of the \nmost impoverished urban areas in Australia.  \n \nAs well as providing accommodation for those who are disadvantaged through poverty, \nunemployment or mental illness (among other things), a significant proportion of public \nhousing in The Parks is given over to accommodating newly arrived refugees. Many of \nthe residents in The Parks come from Somalia and Ethiopia, and more recently from \ncountries such as Uganda and Sudan. There are inevitably conflicts along race lines in \nthese communities. Young Anglo Australian men, who struggle to find employment and \nwho bemoan their lack of a \u201elucky break\u201f routinely retaliate against the new arrivals in \ntheir communities. The broader political discourse of \u201cqueue jumpers\u201d, \u201cillegals\u201d and \nindeed \u201cthe war on terror\u201d doesn\u201ft help to promote congenial relationships within these \ncommunities where incidences of violence and conflict are already quite high.  \n \nSuch stark social realities have drawn recognition from community development \nworkers and others that there is a need to provide \u201ediversionary activities\u201f for \ndisenfranchised local residents as a way of averting them from drugs, crime and other \nanti-social behaviours [8]. For many years, young men have been seen as a vulnerable \npopulation group, and have been given opportunities to abseil, bushwalk, rock climb and \nto experience the adrenaline of risk in ways that don\u201ft involve substance abuse or \nviolence between themselves or against the women of their communities [9]. \nIncreasingly however, the young women of these communities have recognised that they \nhave been left out of this recreational framework, and while they do not necessarily wish \nto sky dive or bungee jump, they nonetheless want the same opportunities for \nrecreation that are afforded to the men folk of their communities. It was in this context \nthat the soccer team came to fruition [10]. \n \nIn 2003, a group of young Muslim women from The Parks are agitated for their local \ncommunity health service to provide opportunities for them to take part in sport. The \nwomen approached the youth worker from the health service who had been working \nmost closely with them on re-settlement issues such as language, employment and \neducation and they argued, quite convincingly, that there was a need to provide \nculturally appropriate sporting opportunities, namely soccer, for women from the \npredominantly Muslim Somali and Ethiopian communities now living in The Parks. Soccer \nwas chosen, as it was a sport that many of the girls had expressed a desire to play. They \nhad seen their brothers, cousins and other male relatives playing soccer, both in their \ncountry of origin and on re-settlement in Australia, and in a moment reminiscent of \nBend It Like Beckham, these young women wanted a similar opportunity to take part in \nteam sport. Following this request, the local health service allocated a community \ndevelopment worker to work closely with the local Somali community (in the first \ninstance) to develop a programme whereby young women could train for and compete \nin a soccer carnival that is held as part of Refugee Week in Adelaide each October. The \nfirst year of the programme (2003) involved roughly sixteen young Muslim women, \nmainly of Somali background, aged between 12 and 20, who took part in weekly training \n 3 \nsessions and then in the final competition itself. The numbers have since grown and, in \n2006, there are now about 40 young women from various backgrounds who compete at \nthe Refugee Week soccer carnival.  \n \nMethodology \nThe data reported in this article is part of a broader study of participation in sport for \nyoung refugee women in Adelaide. The focus of this study is on ameliorating the barriers \nto participation in sport that many refugees face on resettlement in the West. While the \nbroader study has a number of addition research foci and adopts a range of \nmethodological approaches (analysis of secondary data sources, in-depth qualitative \ninterviews with young refugee women and their families, interviews with policy makers \nand local agencies, a photo-voice component, field observations and interviews with the \ncommunity development workers in The Parks and other areas), this article reports \nprimarily on the interviews with and field observations of the young women who play in \nthe soccer team. \n \nThe methods reported in this article include two reflective discussion groups, each \ninvolving thirteen members of the soccer team; ad-hoc discussions with the players \nduring training; field notes of researcher observations during training and competition \nand four face-to-face interviews with the parents (three mothers, one father) of \nparticipating young women. These were conducted through an interpreter to facilitate \ndiscussion from Somali to English and vice versa. All of the interviews were digitally \nrecorded and transcribed verbatim. Each of the interviews lasted approximately 40 \nminutes, with the exception of the discussion groups, which took about 1 \u00bd hours each \ntime.  \n \nHeader in a hijab? \nThe interview and field observation data suggested that there was great diversity in the \nways in which the Muslim women in the soccer team interpreted Islam, and this \nmanifested itself as a constantly shifting tension in which the young women parleyed \ntheir multiple, often conflicting, cultural identities as members of a sporting team, as \nmembers of the Somali community and as young women growing up in contemporary \nAustralian society. \n \nSome of the players, for example, were relatively unconcerned about the religious \nimport of engaging in sport and physical activity. Others, by contrast, who adhered to a \nmore traditional interpretation of Islam, followed much more closely the religious \nrequirements of concealing their bodies from male view, particularly when engaging in \nexercise or physical movement. As such, there was a need to accommodate flexible \nuniform requirements which could both respect these religious beliefs and also preserve \nthe collective identity of the soccer team which wearing a uniform affords. Some of the \nteam elected to wear the shorts and short-sleeved tops of the customary soccer strip, \nwhile others chose to wear long sleeved T-shirts and tracksuit pants under their \nuniform. Some young women wore a bandana in place of their hijab (headscarf which \ncovers the hair and neck area). Others wore the krimar (which covers the hair and front \nof the body) during training and competition, while a small number who normally wore \nthe niqab (face veil, often worn with the krimar), removed it when in the female-only \ntraining environment. Still others elected to play entirely bare headed.  \n \nThe different veils that the women wore clearly signalled different interpretations of \nIslam, and this had consequences for how the players negotiated their involvement in the \n 4 \nsoccer team with their families in particular. In the cases of the women who wore the \nkrimar or the niqab, it was crucial that they could play and train in settings that were \nentirely away from the male gaze.  One mother notes that:  \n\u201cTraditionally, there is a strong sense of gender roles, and women\u201fs roles are in \nthe home, and we have the idea of protecting our young women. So, the idea of \nthe veil is about covering their bodies and not having men who aren\u201ft their family \nseeing their intimate identity as a woman. So, the idea of girls playing sport and \nhaving their legs showing was a big issue for me when Aaliyah and Sabah [11] \nsaid they wanted to join the team.\u201d \n \nThis issue of concealing the body from the male gaze proved particularly problematic at \nthe final Refugee Week competition itself, when the men from the Somali and other \ncommunities came to watch the young women compete. Several of the families were \nhappy for their daughters to train in a female-only environment, however they were \nreluctant to let their daughters then compete in the soccer carnival, where men would \nbe watching [12]. For some of the young women, however, the fact that they would be \n\u201eon show\u201f and in the company of the young men from their community was a huge \nmotivation for them to play at the carnival. It was a chance, in the words of one of them, \nto \u201cmeet lots of hot guys\u201d; these are, after all young women at an age when sexual \nexploration is an inevitable part of establishing one\u201fs own identity. Of central concern \nfor this paper however, this conflict between being \u201ca good Muslim girl\u201d (as one of the \nplayers described herself) and the open flirtation of teenage romance captures the world \nof negotiated identity or \u201cidentity work\u201d, to coin Walseth\u201fs term,  [13] within which \nthese young women continually operate. \n \nThe importance of the need to conceal the body from male view was recognised by the \nplayers, albeit grudgingly in some cases. For many of the players, this was often voiced in \nterms of parental disapproval, rather than their own religious beliefs. Habiba, for \nexample, recalls that \u201cmy dad didn\u201ft like us wearing the shorts. They\u201fre thinking we\u201fre \ntrying to be masculine, more like a guy than a girl with the shorts and the soccer. For \nme, I don\u201ft care.\u201d Such comments suggest that, while for players like Habiba, religion \nplayed a relatively minor role in their lives, honouring such religious modesty was \nnonetheless a central concern for her parents. This was a theme that consistently \nemerged throughout my research. When I asked one of the players how her parents felt \nabout her playing soccer, she replied: \u201cat first, dad said \u201eyou\u201fre a girl, you\u201fre a Muslim \ngirl, you shouldn\u201ft be doing that. You shouldn\u201ft be wearing the shorts and showing guys \nyour body.\u201f And later when we wore the pants at the carnival he was like \u201eoh, ok.\u201f\u201d This \nfather\u201fs belated acceptance of his daughter\u201fs participation in sport, and indeed, the need \nfor the players to be mindful of the religious modesty which underpins their faith, \ncertainly suggests that, for the Muslim women at the centre of this article, taking part in \nsport must always be done in culturally prescribed ways. As Hargreaves writes, \u201cthe \nissue of [Muslim women\u201fs] participation in sport is tied to strongly held beliefs about the \nfemale body that is embraced by culture, tradition, religion and politics\u201d [14]. \n \nWhile such flexible uniform arrangements were part and parcel of the Muslim women\u201fs \nsoccer team, they nonetheless brought into sharp relief many of the issues that Muslim \nwomen encounter in Australian (and other) society more broadly. On the one hand, \nsome of the players expressed frustration and resentment at having to play and train in \nclothes that were oppressively hot and restricted their movement. On the other, those \nwho wore the krimar and the niqab relished the opportunity of being in a female-only \n 5 \nenvironment, for it allowed them to remove their clothing without fear of patriarchal \nreprisal. Irrespective of their degree of adherence to the traditions of Islam, the players \nwere all mindful of the ways in which their dress limited their performance as soccer \nplayers. For some of the better players, this was a source of great frustration. Nadeen, \nthe goal keeper for the team, recalls that:  \n\u201cThere are things like the girls who wear hijab,\u2026initially when we started playing, the \ngirls would take their hijabs off to header the ball and then they\u201fd put it back on after. \nIt was good that they felt comfortable to do that and didn\u201ft feel as through they [the \ncoaches] were disrespecting our culture, but it made it hard to pass the ball, as the \ngirls weren\u201ft where they should be in position but were putting their veils back on, or \nwhatever.\u201d \n \nSuch tensions between the perceived oppression of women and the respect for the \ntradition of veiling are a common feature in debates about Muslim women in the West \n[15]. While the veil promotes modestly by protecting the female body from view, it \nnonetheless restricts movement and symbolises a traditional Islamic culture that is seen \n(predominantly by Western scholars) as being at odds with the secular West. As \nNakamura summarises, \u201cmany Westerners consider the practice of covering one\u201fs body \nto be oppressive, however, for many Muslim women, the hijab does not hide but \nprotects their bodies and their \u201emoral safety\u201f. These contrasting views of the female \nbody and its role in self-expression have great implications for immigrant Muslim \nwomen\u201d[16].  That said, however, the added layer of patriarchal dominance \u2013 that men \nfrequently dictate the terms of the veiling \u2013 continues to make the veiled woman a \nsymbol of an ideological tug-of-war between Islamic and secular ideologies [17]. \n \nSuch competing tensions were evidenced in the need for the players to display \u201enon-\nsexualised\u201f movements in training and competition. Soccer drills such as learning how to \n\u201echest\u201f the ball [block a chest-high pass with the front of the body] were directly at odds \nwith the beliefs of some of the players  (and their parents) that the body was essentially \n\u201eunphysical\u201f and not to be used to display overt muscularity, power or sexuality. For the \nmore conservative players, a manoeuvre like \u201echesting\u201f represented not only an explicit \ndisplay of physicality but also an intrusion on their intimate selves.  For these women, \n\u201echesting\u201f was an explicit display of sexuality and, accordingly, they were reluctant to use \nthis technique in training or in competition. Such reluctance created some tensions \nwithin the team, with the less conservative players feeling that their more modest team \nmates were not pulling their weight and using the full range of skills they had at their \ndisposal.  As was the case with much of the interactions between the players, these \ncompeting tensions around modesty and physicality served to highlight the fluid and \ncontested nature of sport - and identity - for these young Muslim women. Such \ncompeting perspectives served to accentuate the diversity of beliefs within the Muslim \nfamilies involved in the soccer team, underscoring the need to recognise the multiple, \nnegotiated interpretations of Islam, and how this is then brought to bear on a range of \ncultural practices and processes. \n \nIslam or The OC? \nWhile the diversity of attitudes towards the need to conceal the body at training and \ncompetition highlighted most visibly the heterogeneity within the Muslim women in the \nteam, the interview data, in particular, suggested that participation in the soccer team \nalso allowed for the expression and negotiation of some fine-grained identity politics \nthat both affirmed and challenged many of the traditions of Islam. For some, religion \nplayed a relatively minor role in their lives, and these women embraced a range of \n 6 \nwestern cultural practices like clothing styles, popular music, television programmes and \nnew technologies such as mobile phones, social networking websites and MP3 players. \nFor others, these were regarded as the pursuit of Western excess which represented a \nthreat to traditional Islamic culture and beliefs.  \n \nIn many ways, the women in the soccer team embraced aspects of popular culture that \nmay sit at odds with wider perceptions of Muslim women, both within Islamic cultures \nand in the secular West as well. These young women were highly typical of other girls \ngrowing up in a hugely mediated, Western consumer society. They were conscious of \ntheir body shape (they spoke of their uniforms \u201emaking them look fat\u201f), mindful of the \nhottest fashions and obsessed with boys, movie stars and the latest \u201espunks\u201f of popular \nmusic. Indeed, the version of femininity that these young women acted out shared many \nof the mannerisms and attributes of adolescent girls in Australia more broadly in terms \nof sexual exploration, their testing of boundaries and their romantic \u201ecrushes\u201f on the \nstars of popular film and music [18]. \n \nBy way of illustration, the girls in the soccer team would often \u201eplay\u201f at femininity. That \nis,  they would often act out several of the more stereotypical roles made available for \nwomen in popular culture, such as the \u201esexy\u201f back up singer in a music clip; the love \ninterest of Brad Pitt or \u201eSummer\u201f from The OC, a beautiful but doomed character in a \npopular American television import. On one occasion, for example, one of the young \nwomen brought a blonde wig along to training and the girls all took it in turns wearing \nthe wig and pretending to be the \u201cgirl in the film clip with Nelly\u201d, an R&B artist who was \npopular at the time of fieldwork. Much attention was given over to head canting, \n\u201emincing\u201f and acting out the highly stylised poses featured in many popular music film \nclips.  \n \nThe analytical point to note from this is two fold: first, the girls, in taking on these sorts \nof female roles, were content to just be in the background. They were happy to be the \nlove interest or the back up singer rather than the leading role. Such positionings make \nsense when viewed through the lens of the intermeshing and often contradictory \ndomains that the players constantly negotiate. Despite their exposure to a range of \nother media images that may have provided more powerful role models for young \nwomen, these young women nonetheless all fell back on their own culturally mediated \nconceptions of their own gender roles in which their subservience to men is re-\nenforced, even within the female-only training environment. In other words, the players \ncould have chosen to be Avril Lavine or Amy Winehouse. Instead they opted to play the \nback up singer.  \n \nSecond, in such accounts, the traditions of Islam and the (post)-modernity of popular \nculture occupy an uneasy relationship. As Ahmed & Donnan point out: \u201cwhereas the \npost-modern Western world promotes a culture of change, youth and consumerism, \nembracing noise, movement and speed, traditional Islam discourages change and \nemphasises calmness and stability\u201d [19]. Yet, for many of the young women, \ncommunication \u2013 with their parents, siblings, friends and class mates \u2013 was done in a \nsplit second via blue tooth and text messaging. While there is no place for film stars, \nmusic clips or MP3 downloads in the Muslim ideal, the parameters of Islamic thinking \ncannot be seen as outside of broader cultural processes which increasingly emphasise \nthe commodification and secularisation of social life. It is sport, as a very particular \ncultural site that brings these tensions to the foreground in highly compelling ways. As \nHargreaves writes: \u201cfor Muslims across the world there is a conflict in the way in which \nthey live their lives between the Islamic tradition and the pervasive influence of western \n 7 \nculture. Since sport insinuates Westernisation, it presents women with particular bodily \nand cultural uncertainties\u201d [20]. \n \nIn many ways, these Muslim refugee women acted out a version of femininity that many \nwomen in the West would no doubt be familiar with, for it traces a common trajectory \nthrough adolescence. Nonetheless, there were stark differences that were undeniable. \nThese women brought to their enactment of femininity a very particular cultural history \nthat few of us can perhaps appreciate. The young women all spoke of truly traumatic \nexperiences common to other refugee women [21] which they had endured. These \nincluded rape and violence, torture and persecution, the loss of family members and \nother loved ones, as well as periods of time spent in refugee camps prior to settling in \nAustralia and in detention centres on arrival. On re-settlement, these young women \nthen take on additional responsibilities that underscore the gendered hierarchy of \nIslamic life. With their cultural roles very much defined by their domestic responsibilities \nas carers and nurturers [22], these women, some as young as twelve or thirteen, are \nexpected to take on the tasks of English translation for their parents or older relatives, \ncooking, cleaning, and the minding of younger siblings, often in addition to attending \nschool and in some cases holding down part-time jobs as well. These young women are \npositioned in their own communities in very particular ways that impose definitions and \nlimitations which many in the West find difficult to reconcile [23]. \n \nIn this context, the existence of an all-Muslim women\u201fs soccer team may appear \nsomething of a paradox, yet it serves to underscore the complexity of the politics of \nidentity for young Muslim women who have re-settled in countries like Australia. In their \non-going presentation of self as young women, their worlds are constituted by not one \nbut many intermeshing domains or in Bourdieu\u201fs terms \u201efields\u201f [24]. Being a young \nMuslim refugee woman in a country like Australia involves an endless series of strategies \nand readjustments as these women continually negotiate and re-position themselves in a \nworld of fine difference where the similarities are often more revealing of difference \nthan the differences themselves.  \n \nSuch observations share parallels with those of Kay who notes that \u201cminority ethnic \nyouth have been described as skilled cross-cultural navigators, who draw, not only on \ntheir own and the majority culture, but also other minority cultures in the population\u201d \n[25]. While Kay cautions against the assumption that such navigational processes are \nunidirectional \u2013 that Muslim youths are presumed to move only towards the more \nprogressive elements of other cultures, the findings from this study suggest that the \nyoung women do not jettison their Muslim culture, but incorporate it as an \u201cadjustment \nstrategy\u201d [26] into their evolving identity as Muslim women in Australia. \n \nPerforming identity \nThis negotiation of \u201efields\u201f was made maximally visible in the final soccer carnival that the \nyoung women had been training for.  When talking to the players, it was evident just \nhow important the performative space of the final carnival was to them [27]. As Jamira \nnotes: \u201cI liked competition because people were showing more effort than they did at \npractice.\u201d In addition to demonstrating their skills on the soccer pitch, the players could \nshowcase themselves as young women, and most importantly, they could showcase \nthemselves as Somali in an environment where a number of other cultural identities \nwere on display through the various teams competing in the carnival. As the community \ndevelopment worker involved in the programme put it: \u201ethe thing about a multicultural \ncarnival is the whole community comes to watch. You\u201fve got teams representing their \ncountry, and that\u201fs a big deal for them.\u201f On the day of the Refugee Week Soccer \n 8 \nCarnival, this celebration of culture and homeland was displayed in a sensory feast of \ncolour, sound, movement and language. Proud family members held Somali flags high, \nmany of the parents who had come to watch the team were adorned in traditional \nAfrican clothing, drum beats rang out from the side lines and an unfamiliar language was \ncarried through the air as the players called out to their parents from their positions on \nthe pitch. The community development worker continues:  \n\u201cwhat we saw on the day was that the girls played a game of soccer\u2026and the \ncommunities could see that this was a positive experience for them, and from \nthat, there was a sense of pride in the young people from their communities. \n \nThe crucial point to note about the soccer carnival was that, in performing in front of \nother members of their community, many of the more traditional elements of their \nidentity as Muslim women were reinforced. While training had provided a mechanism \nthrough which the players could explore the more \u201ewestern\u201f aspects of their identity \n(such as music and mobile phones), the carnival brought to the foreground many of the \nlong held traditions of Islam, particularly the need to cover the female body. While there \nhad been considerable flexibility as to what the players wore at training, at the carnival, \nall of the women wore long sleeves and tracksuit pants under their strip as recognition \nof their Islamic backgrounds. While Walseth [28] reports that when young Muslim \nwomen in Norway took part in sport they experienced sanctions and harassment from \ntheir community, this does not appear to be the case in the Australian context. If \nanything, soccer became a means through which the women could present a visible, \nnarrative of achievement on behalf of the broader Somali community. These young \nwomen, in other words, became important ambassadors for their community is a \nbroader political and racial environment which seeks to marginalise and \u201eOther\u201f those \nre-settled in Australia on humanitarian grounds. \n \nDiscussion: Muslim women, identity and sport \nThis article has been concerned to explore how a group of mainly Somali, young Muslim \nrefugee women construct their individual and collective identities through sport. To do \nthis, it has outlined the ways in which these women draw on the traditions Islam and the \nresources of western popular culture in, at times, quite contradictory ways. While \nadolescence is rarely straightforward for anyone, these young women must contend \nwith an additional set of tensions and complexities. As refugee women, re-settled in a \nnew country, the players in the soccer team are \u201eout-of-place\u201f in a number of ways [29]. \nDisplaced geographically, they are also \u201eout-of-place\u201f culturally in terms of the uneasy fit \nbetween the traditions of Islam and the excesses of popular culture which they now \nencounter. As described in this article, social and sporting identities, for these young \nwomen, are constructed relationally; through their team-mates, their parents and the \nbroader community alike. In other words, the women in the soccer team are culturally \nconstituted within competing social worlds, as well as through a broader political \ndiscourse that positions them as \u201eOther\u201f.  \n \nThis ethnographic study of a Muslim refugee women\u201fs soccer team has served to \nhighlight the complex set of relations which underscore the formation of one\u201fs identity \nas a social being. For these women, as indeed for other diasporic communities, identity \nis not fixed, but fluid, affected by changing political, social and cultural conditions. As Hall \nwrites:   \nidentities are never unified and, in late modern times, increasingly fragmented \nand fractured; never singular but multiply constructed across different, often \nintersecting and antagonistic discourses, practices and positions. They are subject \n 9 \nto a radical historicisation and are constantly in the process of change and \ntransformation [30]. \nThrough the actions and interactions of the players as they geared up for the Refugee \nWeek Soccer Carnival, we get some sense of how these multiple, intermeshing and \ncontradictory identities are both produced and then performed.  \n \nWhile this article has been centrally concerned with the fluid and competing practices \nand positions through which identities are socially constituted in contemporary times, \nthe political implications of this are never far away. All of the players whose lives inform \nthis paper, also face the burden of poverty as well. All of the players live in one of \nAdelaide\u201fs poorest communities, and there is a need to consider this axis of inequality as \nwell. As Hargeaves writes: \u201cthese women come from historically marginalised groups \nwho have had to struggle against particularly harsh forms of discrimination and have \nconstructed their own sporting identities in changing and difficult conditions\u201d [31]. \n \nAs this article has endeavoured to tease out, there is not a \u201eone size fits all\u201f \ninterpretation of what it means to be a young Muslim woman: indeed, there is great \nfluidity and difference within this particular cultural category, and this has implications \nfor how Muslim women are perceived and regarded in the West, for \u201cthe bodies of \nMuslim women are regulated within the broader context of local-global relations and in \nrelation to Western femininities and sexual politics\u201d[32]. \n \nThere is also a great similarity between the version of adolescent femininity enacted by \nthe young Muslim refugee women whose lives inform this article and that embraced by \nother young women from Anglo-Australian backgrounds. It is these fine distinctions \nrather than the obvious differences of culture or religion as embodied in language or \ndress, for example, that may ultimately prove more instructive about the ways in which \nwe come to understand how young Muslim (and other) women construct their identities \nthrough social and sporting behaviours. It is this accommodation and negotiation of \n\u201esameness\u201f and \u201edifference\u201f that is particularly intriguing, for it hits on one of the most \nenduring themes in sociological and other inquiries: how is identity defined and created; \nwhere is it located and how is it communicated? The question of \u201ehow do you know \nwho you are\u201f is at the centre of much critical inquiry, and as presented here, the soccer \nteam provides a unique site through which to explore such questions of identity for \nyoung Muslim refugee women in contemporary Australia. \n \nNotes \n1.

It was constructed by the SA Housing Trust between 1945 and \n1964, as part of an overall economic development strategy that sought to provide \nlow-cost rental housing for workers and their families which was close to the \nmanufacturing and automotive factories in the area at the time. Economic changes in \n 10 \nThe Parks and other public housing estates, coupled with shifts in family structures \nand progressively tighter restrictions governing access to public housing have \n\u201cresulted in tenants who increasingly experience problems of unemployment, low-\nincome and poverty and, in some instances, increasing incidences of crime and \nviolence\u201d (Palmer et al. 2004: 412). \n7.

Much research has documented the positive impacts of recreation programs for \u201eat-\nrisk\u201f youth (see Wilson & White, \u201eTolerance Rules\u201f for a summary) however this has \ntended to focus on the experiences of men. In a related vein, many of the classic \nsociological and cultural studies of \u201eyouth\u201f, such as those undertaken in the mid \n1970s by the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (eg Hall & Jefferson \nResistance through Rituals:; Hebdidge Subculture: the Meaning of Style; Willis Learning to \nLabour) have been critiqued because the experiences of female youth were largely \nabsent from the empirical research. \n10.  It has been noted elsewhere that women from culturally diverse backgrounds are \nless likely to participate in sports activities, engage in physical activity or be sports \nspectators (Acosta, \u201eThe Minority Experience in Sport:; Armstrong, et al., Physical \nActivity Patterns of Australian Adults: Results of the 1999 National Physical Activity Survey; \nCollins, \u201eSocial Exclusion and Sport in a Multicultural Society\u201f; Taylor, \u201eThe Rhetoric \nof Exclusion\u201f). \n11.
