The study of dusty plasmas is of significant practical use and scientific\ninterest. A characteristic feature of dust grains in a plasma is that they are typic-\nally smaller than the electron Debye distance, a property which we exploit using\nthe technique of matched asymptotic expansions. We first consider the case of a\nspherical dust particle in a stationary plasma, employing the Allen\u2013Boyd\u2013Reynolds\ntheory, which assumes cold, collisionless ions. We derive analytical expressions for\nthe electric potential, the ion number density and ion velocity. This requires only\none computation that is not specific to a single set of dust\u2013plasma parameters, and\nsheds new light on the shielding distance of a dust grain. The extension of this\ncalculation to the case of uniform ion streaming past the dust grain, a scenario\nof interest in many dusty plasmas, is less straightforward. For streaming below a\ncertain threshold we again establish asymptotic solutions but above the streaming\nthreshold there appears to be a fundamental change in the behaviour of the system.\n1. Introduction\nDust particles are commonplace in plasmas. When manufacturing semiconductors\nthe presence of dust in plasmas can cause expensive damage to silicon substrates\n[1, 2] and yet also offers opportunities for the production of new, improved silicon\nfilms [3,4]. In astrophysics, dust plays an important role in the formation of stars\nand planets and in the constantly changing structure of planetary rings [5, 6].\nThe extensive literature on the experimental and theoretical study of dusty plasmas\nhas been summarized in a recent review [7].\nWhen a dust grain is immersed in a plasma, it collects both ions and electrons.\nIn the steady state it charges to a floating potential, such that the total ion current\nto its surface is balanced by the total electron current. Because electrons are more\nmobile than ions, this potential is typically negative. The floating potential depends\nfundamentally on the electron and ion dynamics and vice versa, and any solution\nto the dust\u2013plasma problem needs to be determined self-consistently.\nIn the study of dusty plasmas the structure of the electric potential around a\nsingle grain is fundamental. In one experimental approach, Konopka et al. [8, 9]\nstudied head-on collisions between dust grains in the sheath of a radiofrequency\n(RF) discharge. By analysing the resulting grain trajectories, Konopka et al. calcu-\nlated the grain charge and the screening length. They pointed out that theoretical\nwork was required to determine \u2018the origin of the deduced screening distances\u2019.\n2 N. Arinaminpathy, J. E. Allen and J. R. Ockendon\nHowever, their results apply to dust in the sheath of the discharge and in this\npaper we shall be concerned with dust in the plasma.\nOther than the work of Konopka et al. there is a lack of experimental evidence\nfor the structure of the electric potential around a dust grain. In part, this is\nthe result of practical difficulties involved; typical laboratory probes are larger, by\norders of magnitude, than the dust grains themselves. Hence most estimates of the\npotential distribution around a single grain in a plasma rely on theoretical models.\nThese include kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations [10,11], as well as numerical\nstudies of models such as the Allen\u2013Boyd\u2013Reynolds (ABR) theory (relevant to cold\nions) [12] and the complete orbital motion theory (relevant to \u2018thermal\u2019 ions) [13].\nIn the present paper we first study the ABR model for small grains using the\ntechnique of matched asymptotic expansions [14]. In the following section we\npresent the ABR model, non-dimensionalize it and then show that the problem\nis mathematically well-posed. Finally, in Sec. 4, we consider the effect of a uniform\nion streaming relative to the grain.\n2. The ABR model\nConsider a spherical dust grain in a stationary plasma. In the steady state, the\ngrain charges to a floating potential which is negative with respect to the plasma,\nso that ions are accelerated towards the grain and electrons repelled. We make the\nfollowing assumptions about the plasma.\n(1) The ions are singly charged, collisionless and \u2018cold\u2019, so that their net radial\nmotion towards the grain dominates their random, thermal motion.\n(2) The electrons are near thermal equilibrium, so that their density is accurately\ndescribed by a Boltzmann distribution. This is likely to hold over most of space\nbut fails near the grain surface, because of the collection of electrons there.\nWe check the validity of this assumption a posteriori.\n(3) We neglect ionization and recombination.\nWe note that, although we do not deal with collisions in this paper, a small number\nof collisions at great distances can, in some cases, result in ions moving essentially\nin the radial direction. This has been demonstrated in the case of Langmuir probe\nmeasurements [15] and similar behaviour is to be expected in the case of a dust\nparticle. This is one of the reasons why the radial motion theory is of interest to\nexperimental physicists.\nWe work in spherical co-ordinates, all variables depending only on the radial\ndistance, r. We denote the grain radius by Rdust and the electric potential by V .\nTaking the ions to have number density Ni, mass Mi and speed vi, we have\n1\n2\nMiv\n2\ni + eV = c, (2.1a)\nd\ndr\n(r2Nivi) = 0, (2.1b)\nd2V\ndr2\n+\n2\nr\ndV\ndr\n= \u2212 e\n\u03b50\n(Ni \u2212 Ne), (2.1c)\nwhere e is the magnitude of the electron charge, Ne is their number density, \u03b50\nModelling an isolated dust grain in a plasma 3\nis the permittivity of free space and c is a constant. These equations correspond,\nrespectively, to the conservation of ion energy, conservation of ion flux and Poisson\u2019s\nequation. From assumption (2), Ne satisfies\nNe = N0 exp\n(\neV\nkBTe\n)\n, (2.2)\nwhere kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, Te is the electron temperature and N0 is the\nplasma density. On the grain surface the potential is not known a priori. Instead\nit obeys the floating condition, which states that the total ion flux to the surface is\nequal to the total electron flux, as derived in, for example, [16]. That is,\n\u2212Nivi = N0\n\u221a\nkBTe\n2\u03c0me\nexp\n(\neV\nkBTe\n)\non r = Rdust, (2.3)\nwhere me is the electron mass. Owing to the radial symmetry of the model, (2.3)\nholds whether the grain is electrically conducting or an insulator. Finally, we impose\nplasma conditions far from the grain:\nV, vi \u2192 0, N \u2192 N0 as r \u2192 \u221e. (2.4)\nThese are the equations of the ABR theory [17], which was initially developed\nto model an electrostatic probe in a plasma, and was subsequently applied in the\ntheory of dusty plasmas. The fact that the floating potential must be found as part\nof the solution raises questions about the well-posedness of the problem. From a\nphysical point of view, the dust grain and the plasma interact to automatically\nset up a potential distribution in space, and a floating potential; hence, in a model\ncapturing the essential interactions between the grain and the plasma, we would\nexpect there to be enough information to specify the potential distribution uniquely.\nWe employ the following normalizations,\nr\u02c6 =\nr\n\u03bbDe\n, (2.5a)\n\u03c6 =\neV\nkTe\n, (2.5b)\nn =\nNi\nN0\n, (2.5c)\nne =\nNe\nN0\n, (2.5d)\nq =\nvi\nvB\n, (2.5e)\nwhere vB =\n\u221a\nkBTe\/Mi, the Bohm speed, and we will subsequently drop the hat on\nr. Furthermore, we introduce a normalized dust radius\n\u0005 =\nRdust\n\u03bbDe\n. (2.6)\n4 N. Arinaminpathy, J. E. Allen and J. R. Ockendon\nNote that, in a typical laboratory plasma, \u03bbDe can be of the order of millimetres\nand Rdust of the order of tens of micrometres. Correspondingly, in this paper we will\nbe concerned with the case \u0005 \u223c 10\u22122.\nUsing the above normalizations, we can eliminate n and q from the resulting\nsystem of equations to obtain\nd2\u03c6\ndr2\n+\n2\nr\nd\u03c6\ndr\n= e\u03c6 \u2212 J\nr2\n\u221a\u22122\u03c6, (2.7)\nwhere 4\u03c0J , an unknown constant, is the total ion flux to the dust surface, normal-\nized in terms of \u03bb2DevBN0. Knowing \u03c6, we can determine q and n from\n1\n2q\n2 + \u03c6 = 0, r2nq = J. (2.8)\nTwo boundary conditions are\n\u03c6 \u2192 0 as r \u2192 \u221e, (2.9)\nand\nJ = \u00052\u03b3e\u03c6(\u0002), (2.10)\nwhere \u03b3 is the \u2018gas parameter\u2019, given by\n\u03b3 =\n\u221a\nMi\n2\u03c0me\n, (2.11)\nand n, q depend on \u03c6 through\nn =\nJ\nr2\n\u221a\u22122\u03c6, q = \u2212\n\u221a\u22122\u03c6. (2.12)\nFrom (2.4), a third boundary condition is\nn \u2192 1 as r \u2192 \u221e. (2.13)\nNote that, when we take c = 0 in (2.1) without loss of generality, the condition\nq \u2192 0 as r \u2192 \u221e is satisfied automatically by (2.9). There are thus two specified\nparameters in this problem, \u0005 and \u03b3, and \u0005 \u223c 0.01, whereas \u03b3 is at least 17 for\nhydrogen and can be as large as 108 in the typical case of argon.\nReturning now to the question of uniqueness, because J and \u03c6(\u0005) are unknown\na priori, it seems that there is insufficient information to determine \u03c6 uniquely.\nHowever, the condition (2.13) is more powerful than it might initially seem; it\nallows us ultimately to associate a unique value of J with any choice of \u0005 and \u03b3, as\nwe now show.\nFirst, we consider the related problem where J is known, but we drop the floating\ncondition (2.10). We then have the following theorem, a proof of which is given in\nAppendix A.\nTheorem 2.1 (Uniqueness result). If a solution exists to the problem\nd2\u03c6\ndr2\n+\n2\nr\nd\u03c6\ndr\n= e\u03c6 \u2212 J\nr2\n\u221a\u22122\u03c6, \u03c6 < 0, \u0005 < r < \u221e, (2.14)\nsuch that\nJ\nr2\n\u221a\u22122\u03c6 \u2192 1 as r \u2192 \u221e, (2.15)\nwhere J is a given, positive constant, then that solution is unique, for any \u0005 > 0.\nModelling an isolated dust grain in a plasma 5\nTo address the fact that J is unknown, we now incorporate the floating condition\n(2.10) using the sequence\nJ \u0005\u2212\u2192 \u03c6(r) \u0002\u0005\u2212\u2192 \u03c6(\u0005) \u0002,\u03b3\u0005\u2212\u2192 J, (2.16)\nwhere \u2018A\nC\u0005\u2212\u2192 B\u2019 states that B follows uniquely from A, given C. The first arrow\nin (2.16) follows from the uniqueness theorem, and the last arrow follows from the\nfloating condition (2.10). Hence we expect ultimately to find an equation for J , and\nhence \u03c6(r), for any given \u0005, \u03b3.\nIt is convenient to define the shorthand notation\n\u0005\u02c6 = \u0005\u03b31\/2, (2.17)\nand\nk = e\u03c6(\u0002), (2.18)\nso that \u0005\u02c6 is proportional to the dust size, and k is a measure of the unknown surface\npotential. Hence, using the floating condition, we have\nJ = \u0005\u02c62k. (2.19)\nNote that \u0005\u02c6 is a known quantity, whereas k is unknown. Typically, \u0005 = 0.01, \u03b3 \u0001 102,\nso that we assume\n\u0005\u02c6\u0001 1. (2.20)\nBecause the surface potential is negative we have from (2.18) that 0 < k < 1.\nMoreover, it has been shown [12] that the floating potential goes to zero as \u0005 \u2192 0,\nand so we assume here that\nk \u223c O(1), (2.21)\nand we will verify this a posteriori.\nIn terms of \u0005\u02c6, k, (2.16) can be written as an iteration to determine k:\nk\n\u0002\u02c6\u0005\u2212\u2192 \u03c6(r) \u0002\u02c6,\u03b3\u0005\u2212\u2192 \u03c6(\u0005\u02c6\u03b3\u22121\/2) \u0002\u02c6,\u03b3\u0005\u2212\u2192 k, (2.22)\nwhere\nd2\u03c6\ndr2\n+\n2\nr\nd\u03c6\ndr\n= e\u03c6 \u2212 \u0005\u02c6\n2k\nr2\n\u221a\u22122\u03c6, \u0005\u02c6\u0001 1, \u0005\u02c6\u03b3\n\u22121\/2 < r < \u221e, (2.23)\nfor \u03c6, k with\n\u03c6 \u223c \u2212\u0005\u02c64k2\/2r4 as r \u2192 \u221e, (2.24)\nand\nk = exp(\u03c6(\u0005\u02c6\u03b3\u22121\/2)). (2.25)\nAlthough our basic assumption is that \u0005\u02c6 is small, we must remember that \u03b3 may\nbe as large as O(102), so that we are confronted with a two-parameter asymptotic\nproblem. However, for ease of presentation we will begin by taking \u03b3 = O(1).\n3. Matched asymptotic expansions\nIn order to find \u03c6(r) asymptotically for fixed \u03b3 = O(1) as \u0005\u02c6 \u2192 0 for any k = O(1),\nwe find it convenient to begin with the far-field expansions, valid as r \u2192 \u221e. Working\ninwards to the dust surface, we ultimately use (2.25) to determine k.\n6 N. Arinaminpathy, J. E. Allen and J. R. Ockendon\nOn physical grounds, referring to Poisson\u2019s equation \u22072\u03c6 = e\u03c6 \u2212 n, we ex-\npect that far from the grain we would have a quasi-neutral plasma region where\n\u22072\u03c6\u0001 e\u03c6, n. We shall refer to this as the \u2018outer region\u2019. Closer to the grain, we expect\nto find a space-charge region where \u22072\u03c6 \u223c O(e\u03c6, n), in which there is a balance of\nterms in Poisson\u2019s equation. We shall refer to this as the \u2018intermediate region\u2019.\nWe use matching (as described by Van Dyke [14]) to ensure that the asymptotic\nexpansions found in each of these regions are mutually consistent, and this will also\nreveal the existence of an inner expansion, for r \u223c O(\u0005\u02c6), where the space charge is\nmerely a small perturbation in the determination of the electric potential.\n3.1. Outer region\nFrom (2.24) we have that\n\u03c6 \u223c \u2212 \u0005\u02c6\n4k2\n2r4\n+ \u03c6\u00af as r \u2192 \u221e, (3.1)\nwhere\n\u0005\u02c64k2\u22072\u03c6\u00af + r4\u03c6\u00af \u223c \u0005\u02c6\n8k4\n2r4\n(\n12\nr2\n\u2212 1\n)\nas r \u2192 \u221e.

(3.4)\nWe also have\nn \u223c 1 + \u0005\u02c6\n4k2\n2r4\n(\n12\nr2\n\u2212 1\n)\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , q \u223c \u2212 \u0005\u02c6\n2k\nr2\n+\n\u0005\u02c66k3\n2r6\n(\n12\nr2\n\u2212 1\n)\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.5)\nThe expansion (3.4) fails when the first and second terms become comparable, which\noccurs at a distance\nr \u223c O(\u0005\u02c62\/3). (3.6)\nWe also note that, on this scale, we have\n\u22072\u03c6 \u223c O\n(\n\u0005\u02c64\/\u0005\u02c68\/3\n\u0005\u02c64\/3\n)\n\u223c O(1), n, e\u03c6 \u223c O(1), (3.7)\nindicating that space charge has become significant. Hence we enter the interme-\ndiate region.\n3.2. Intermediate region r \u223c O(\u0005\u02c62\/3)\nWe use capital letters to denote terms in the intermediate expansions. Referring to\nthe outer expansions, we find that \u03c6 \u223c O(\u0005\u02c64\/3) when r \u223c O(\u0005\u02c62\/3). Thus we rescale\nby writing\nr = \u0005\u02c62\/3R, \u03c6 \u223c \u0005\u02c64\/3\u03c6\u00af0(R) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.8)\nRecall, as noted earlier, that the dust surface is in the region r \u223c O(\u0005\u02c6), i.e. on a\nsmaller length scale than the intermediate region. Thus, to find the behaviour of \u03c6\nin the vicinity of the dust grain we will be interested in the small-R behaviour of\nthe intermediate expansions defined above.\nModelling an isolated dust grain in a plasma 7\nNow, substituting (3.8) into (2.23) and letting \u0005\u02c6 \u2192 0 yields the lowest-order\nequation\nd2\u03c6\u00af0\ndR2\n+\n2\nR\nd\u03c6\u00af0\ndR\n= 1 \u2212 k\nR2\n\u221a\n\u2212 2\u03c6\u00af0\n, 0 < R < \u221e, (3.9)\nwith the far-field matching condition\n\u03c6\u00af0 \u223c \u2212 k\n2\n2R4\nas R \u2192 \u221e, (3.10)\nwhich ensures the consistency, to lowest order, of the intermediate and outer ex-\npansions.\nEquation (3.9) is almost the full problem, apart from the electron density term\nbeing replaced by 1. Hence, with a proof similar to that of the uniqueness result\nwe can show that, for a given k, (3.9) together with (3.10) has a unique solution for\n\u03c6\u00af0. The problem must be solved numerically. To do this we can fortunately scale k\nout of the problem by writing\nR = k1\/3r\u02dc, \u03c6\u00af0(R) = k2\/3\u03c6\u02dc0(r\u02dc). (3.11)\nThe problem now reads\nd2\u03c6\u02dc0\ndr\u02dc2\n+\n2\nr\u02dc\nd\u03c6\u02dc0\ndr\u02dc\n= 1 \u2212 1\nr\u02dc2\n\u221a\n\u22122\u03c6\u02dc0\n, (3.12)\nwith\n\u03c6\u02dc0 \u223c \u2212 12r\u02dc4 as r\u02dc \u2192 \u221e. (3.13)\nTo work towards the dust surface we now find the behaviour of \u03c6\u02dc0 in the small-r\u02dc\nlimit. Since\nd2(r\u02dc\u03c6\u02dc0)\ndr\u02dc2\n= r\u02dc \u2212 1\u221a\n\u22122r\u02dc(r\u02dc\u03c6\u02dc0)\n, (3.14)\nwith\nr\u02dc\u03c6\u02dc0 \u223c \u2212 12r\u02dc3 as r\u02dc \u2192 \u221e, (3.15)\nwe find that\n\u03c6\u02dc0 \u223c c0\nr\u02dc\n+ c1 \u2212 43(\u22122c0)\n\u22121\/2r\u02dc1\/2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 as r\u02dc \u2192 0, (3.16)\nfor constants c0, c1, both fixed by (3.15). The coefficients of all successive terms\nare determined by the constants c0, c1. To find these constants, we carry out a\nnumerical integration of (3.14). When written in terms of \u03c8 = r\u02dc\u03c6\u02dc0 we shoot from\nsome large r\u02dc, using there the initial conditions on \u03c8, d\u03c8\/dr\u02dc provided by (3.15), and\nthen estimate\nc0 = lim\nr\u02dc\u21920\u03c8, c1 = limr\u02dc\u21920\u03c8\n\u2032. (3.17)\nNote that d2\u03c8\/dr\u02dc2 is unbounded in this limit, but we can even work down to\nr\u02dc = 10\u221212 to obtain reasonable estimates of c0 and c1, as shown in Fig. 1. Thus we\nfind\nc0 \u2248 \u22120.98, c1 \u2248 1.71. (3.18)\n8 N. Arinaminpathy, J. E. Allen and J. R. Ockendon\nFigure 1. Numerical plot of \u03c8(r\u02dc). The inset shows a magnification near r\u02dc = 0, with both\naxes on the same scale. The integration parameters are r\u02dcinit = 40, r\u02dcend = 10\u221212.\nNote that, because both \u0005\u02c6 and k have been scaled out of the problem on this length\nscale, the constants c0, c1 are universal.\nThus, in terms of the original intermediate variables defined in (3.8) we have\n\u03c6\u00af0 \u223c c0k\nR\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 as R \u2192 0, (3.19)\nand n, q are given by\nn \u223c k\nR2\n\u221a\n\u2212 2\u03c6\u00af0\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , q \u223c \u2212\u0005\u02c62\/3\n\u221a\n\u22122\u03c6\u00af0 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.20)\nFrom (2.1b), we note that this implies that the divergence of the ion flux nq satisfies\nd\ndr\u02dc\n(n\u02dcq\u02dc) +\n2n\u02dcq\u02dc\nr\u02dc\n= \u22124\u03c0\u03b4(r\u02dc), (3.21)\nto lowest order in the intermediate region, where\nn = kn\u02dc, q = \u0005\u02c62\/3k1\/3q\u02dc. (3.22)\nThis region thus perceives the dust particle as an ion sink of strength 4\u03c0.\nIn principle, we should now make a final rescaling in which r \u223c O(\u0005\u02c6) before using\nthe information in (2.25). However, were we to scale \u03c6 and r with \u0005\u02c6 we would simply\nfind that \u03c6 satisfied Laplace\u2019s equation to lowest order and the relevant solution\nwould simply be the first term in (3.19) and (3.20). Hence, in outer variables, the\nsolution near the grain is\n\u03c6 \u223c \u0005\u02c6\n2c0k\nr\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u223c \u0005\u02c6\n\u221a\nk(\u22122c0)\u22121\/2\nr3\/2\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , q \u223c \u2212\u0005\u02c6\n\u221a\nk(\u22122c0)1\/2\nr1\/2\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.23)\nand we now come to the vital closure condition on k.\nModelling an isolated dust grain in a plasma 9\nSetting r = \u0005\u02c6\u03b3\u22121\/2 in (3.23), we find that the surface potential is\n\u03c6(\u0005) \u223c \u0005\u03b3c0k, (3.24)\nand hence k is given, to lowest order, by\nk \u223c exp(\u0005\u03b3c0k). (3.25)\nSince c0 < 0, (3.25) has a unique solution k. Moreover we see that, since \u03b3 has been\nassumed to beO(1), k \u223c 1 to lowest order. However, since our asymptotic procedure\nis valid as long as both \u0005\u02c6 = \u0005\u03b31\/2\u0001 1 and k = O(1), we see that (3.25) gives a correct,\nunique value of k to lowest order even when \u03b3\u0002 1, as long as \u0005\u03b3 \u0001 O(1). This is\ntrue in most physically realistic cases, as, for example, in laboratory experiments\nusing argon where \u0005 = 0.01, \u03b3 = 108. In this case we find k \u2248 0.56. For comparison,\na full numerical calculation was also conducted on (2.7)\u2013(2.10) using a shooting\nmethod [18], giving\nk = 0.57. (3.26)\nSome potential distributions are presented in Fig. 2, which shows \u03c6(r) for two\ndifferent particle sizes, \u0005 = 0.01 and \u0005 = 0.0001. In these graphs the asymptotic\nand full numerical solutions are superimposed for comparison.\nWe now briefly discuss some physical implications of this calculation.\n3.3. Electron density\nThe electron Boltzmann relation (2.2) arises from integrating the Maxwell\u2013\nBoltzmann density distribution function over the entire velocity space [19]. We\nnow consider the effect of an absorbing dust grain on the validity of this procedure.\nBeing negatively charged, the dust grain repels electrons but at any point outside\nthe dust grain a certain proportion of electrons moving towards the dust grain\nwill have sufficient energy to reach the dust surface and be collected there. This\nwill introduce a deficit in the number of electrons moving radially away from the\ngrain and hence introduce an error in the Boltzmann distribution there. On length\nscales larger than the grain, i.e. r\u0002 \u0005, the grain appears as a localized sink, and\nthe proportion of electrons reaching the grain is small. Hence the error in the\nBoltzmann distribution is also small, whenever r\u0002 \u0005.\nOn the other hand, sufficiently close to the grain the Boltzmann distribution is\ninvalid; adjacent to the surface, for example, there are electrons moving towards\nthe surface but none are travelling away, and so the right-hand side of (2.2) is an\noverestimate by a factor of 2. However, this does not invalidate our results because,\nas discussed after (3.20), \u03c6 satisfies Laplace\u2019s equation in the inner region, to lowest\norder. Physically, this is because the potential distribution near the sphere surface is\npredominantly the result of charge on the surface itself, rather than the surrounding\nfree electrons and ions. Thus the lowest-order expansion in \u03c6 would be unaffected\nby correcting overestimates in the electron density, and hence our solutions remain\nvalid.\n3.4. Shielding\nA new shielding distance has arisen naturally from the calculation. The scale\nr \u223c \u00052\/3\u03b31\/3 derived in (3.6) corresponds physically to the size of the space-charge\nregion, and therefore represents the shielding distance. In \u2018unnormalized\u2019 variables\n10 N. Arinaminpathy, J. E. Allen and J. R. Ockendon\nFigure 2. Comparison of inner, intermediate and outer MAE solutions (dashed lines), with\n\u2018full\u2019 numerical solution (solid line), for different particle sizes: (a) \u0002 = 0.01, \u03b3 = 108;\n(b) \u0002 = 0.001, \u03b3 = 108. On the scale of both graphs the numerical \u2018intermediate\u2019 and\n\u2018full\u2019 solutions are indistinguishable. The inset shows a close-up of these two plots in the\nintermediate region. The surface potentials are (a) \u03c6(\u0002) = \u22120.56 and (b) \u03c6(\u0002) = \u22120.01.\nthis distance is\nRs \u223c R2\/3dust\u03b31\/3\u03bb1\/3De . (3.27)\nWe recall the two shielding distances commonly quoted in the literature, namely\nthe \u2018electron\u2019 and the so-called \u2018linearized\u2019 Debye lengths, respectively,\n\u03bbDe =\n\u221a\n\u03b50kBTe\ne2N0\n, \u03bbDl =\n(\ne2N0\n\u03b50kBTe\n+\ne2N0\n\u03b50kBTi\n)\u22121\/2\n. (3.28)\nModelling an isolated dust grain in a plasma 11\nConsider first the electron Debye distance. Under the normalization in (2.5a) it\nis unity, which is clearly larger than our new estimate: in the case of argon, for\nexample, when \u0005 = 0.01 we have Rs\/\u03bbDe = \u00052\/3\u03b31\/3 \u223c 0.2. Although \u03bbDe can be\na characteristic length scale in its own right, it does not necessarily correspond to\nthe shielding distance of a dust grain. On the other hand, the \u2018linearized\u2019 Debye\ndistance arises from the Debye\u2013Huckel model. This assumes that the ions are in\nthermal equilibrium and, in the case of finite Ti, when the ions are collisionless and\nRdust\/\u03bbDl\u0001 1, then the potential distribution predicted by this model is an excellent\napproximation, except at large distances [13]. However, for our cold-ion scenario,\nthe theory is inapplicable. In particular, allowing Ti \u2192 0 in \u03bbDl in (3.28) results in\nthe Debye length also going to zero, which is unphysical for the case of a dust grain\nin a plasma with cold ions.\nApart from the possible numerical discrepancies between (3.27) and (3.28), we\nemphasize that our new shielding distance for a dust grain in a cold plasma depends\nquite sensitively on the radius of the grain.\nWe now extend the radial-motion model to describe the effect of an ion stream\npast the dust grain, a common scenario in dusty plasmas.\n4. Uniform ion streaming\nWe write \u03bd for the steady ion streaming speed, normalized in terms of the Bohm\nspeed vB. In Cartesian co-ordinates we assume that the streaming is parallel to\nthe x-axis, with the dust grain centred at the origin. We no longer have spherical\nsymmetry, but rather axial symmetry about the x-axis. Denoting the dimensionless\nion velocity by q and using the same non-dimensional variables as in (2.5) we then\nhave\n\u2207 \u00b7 (nq) = 0, (4.1a)\n(q \u00b7 \u2207)q = \u2212\u2207\u03c6, (4.1b)\n\u22072\u03c6 = e\u03c6 \u2212 n, (4.1c)\ncorresponding, respectively, to conservation of ion flux, the equation of motion of\nthe ions and Poisson\u2019s equation. The plasma streaming condition is\nq \u2192 \u03bdx\u02c6, \u03c6 \u2192 0, n \u2192 1 as r \u2192 \u221e, (4.2)\nwhere x\u02c6 is the unit vector in the x-direction, and the floating condition on the grain\nsurface r = \u0005 is given by the following equations:\n\u2022 conducting grain, \u03c6 = \u03c6d (constant), such that\n1\n2\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\n(\u2212nq \u00b7 n)|r=\u0002 sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 = \u03b3e\u03c6d ; (4.3)\n\u2022 insulated grain,\n\u2212nq \u00b7 n = \u03b3e\u03c6, (4.4)\nwhere n is the unit outward normal to the grain. For ease of presentation we will\nagain begin by assuming \u03b3 is of O(1).\nBecause the ions are initially irrotational, and move under a conservative force,\nby Kelvin\u2019s theorem the ion motion must remain irrotational throughout. Hence\n12 N. Arinaminpathy, J. E. Allen and J. R. Ockendon\nwe can write q as the gradient of a velocity potential \u03a6,\nq = \u2207\u03a6. (4.5)\nThus the far-field condition (4.2) on q corresponds to the requirement that \u03a6 \u2192 \u03bdx\nas r \u2192 \u221e. Also, we can replace (4.1b) by the energy equation\n1\n2 |q|2 + \u03c6 = 12\u03bd2. (4.6)\n4.1. Ion flux in the outer region\nThe dust grain transmits information about its presence even at large distances by\nestablishing an ion flux to its surface. Integrating (4.1a) and using the divergence\ntheorem and either (4.3) or (4.4) shows that the lowest-order correction to the\nuniform ion stream is a sink of strength 4\u03c0\u00052\u03b3K = 4\u03c0\u0005\u02c62K, where \u0005\u02c6 is as defined in\n(2.17) and\nK =\n1\n2\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\ne\u03c6|r=\u0002 sin \u03b8 d\u03b8. (4.7)\nWe now assume that, for small \u03bd,\n\u03a6 \u223c \u03bdx + \u0005\u02c6\n2K\nr\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 as r \u2192 \u221e. (4.8)\nThe remaining governing equations yield the following expansions for \u03c6, n valid for\nany \u0005\u02c6, \u03bd\u0001 1:\n\u03a6 \u223c \u03bdx + \u0005\u02c6\n2K\nr\n+\n\u0005\u02c62\u03bd2K\n4r\n(\n2x2\nr2\n\u2212 1\n)\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (4.9)\n\u03c6 \u223c \u0005\u02c6\n2\u03bdKx\nr3\n+\n\u0005\u02c62\u03bd3Kx\n4r3\n(\n6x2\nr2\n\u2212 5\n)\n\u2212 \u0005\u02c6\n4K2\n2r4\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (4.10)\nn \u223c 1 + \u0005\u02c6\n2\u03bdKx\nr3\n+\n\u0005\u02c62\u03bd3Kx\n4r3\n(\n6x2\nr2\n\u2212 5\n)\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 as r \u2192 \u221e. (4.11)\nNote that the effect of any non-zero streaming is to introduce a dipole into the\nelectric field, far from the grain. However, the asymptotic behaviour nearer the\ndust grain, and hence the value of K, is different for different parameter regimes\nin \u03bd.\n4.2. Case 1: weak streaming, 0 < \u03bd\u0001 \u0005\u02c62\/3\nEquations (4.9)\u2013(4.11) describe the lowest-order solution when we are sufficiently\nfar from the dust particle for it to represent a small perturbation to the uniform ion\nstream, i.e. when r\u0002 \u0005\u02c6\u03bd\u22121\/2. Even when r \u0001 \u0005\u02c6\u03bd\u22121\/2 these expansions can still be\ncarried out, with the ion stream acting as a small perturbation to the ABR solution\nin the form\n\u03a6 \u223c \u0005\u02c6\n2K\nr\n+\u03bdx+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c6 \u223c \u2212 \u0005\u02c6\n4K2\n2r4\n+\n\u0005\u02c62\u03bdKx\nr3\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u223c 1+ 6\u0005\u02c6\n4K2\nr6\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (4.12)\nHowever, when we further reduce r, we see that the outer expansions break down\nat a distance r \u223c O(\u0005\u02c62\/3) from the grain, the size of the space-charge region. In this\nregion the ions have a kinetic energy considerably exceeding their original kinetic\nModelling an isolated dust grain in a plasma 13\nFigure 3.

Thus, for r\u02dc > 0, the lowest-order problem reads\n\u2207 \u00b7 (n\u02dc0\u2207\u03a6\u02dc0) = 0, (4.14a)\n1\n2 |\u2207\u03a6\u02dc0|2 + \u03c6\u02dc0 = 0, (4.14b)\n\u22072\u03c6\u02dc0 = 1 \u2212 n\u02dc0, (4.14c)\nwith matching conditions\n\u03a6\u02dc0 \u223c 1\nr\u02dc\n, (4.15a)\n\u03c6\u02dc0 \u223c \u2212 12r\u02dc4 , (4.15b)\nn\u02dc0 \u2192 1 as r\u02dc \u2192 \u221e. (4.15c)\nIn particular, as in (3.21) we expect (4.14a) to imply that in the intermediate region\n\u2207 \u00b7 (n\u02dc0\u2207\u03a6\u02dc0) = \u22124\u03c0\u03b4(r\u02dc). (4.16)\nThe matching conditions (4.15) are the same as for the intermediate region in the\nradial-motion model. As indicated by the absence of \u03bd in (4.14) and (4.15), the\nion stream is too small to have any effect on the lowest-order terms in this region.\nHence we expect that the lowest-order intermediate solutions are in fact spherically\nsymmetric, giving the simple result that the intermediate and inner solutions are\nthe same as in the radial-motion case.\nFigure 3 shows schematically the ion streamlines in this case; whereas flow-\nrelated terms dominate in the expansions at large distances, there is a \u2018switchover\ndistance\u2019 r \u223c \u0005\u02c6\u03bd\u22121\/2 at which they are replaced at lowest order by spherically\nsymmetric terms. As long as this distance is greater than the shielding distance,\n14 N. Arinaminpathy, J. E. Allen and J. R. Ockendon\nFigure 4. Spatial structure and streamlines for the \u2018threshold stream\u2019 case.\nwe revert to spherically symmetric lowest-order solutions from the intermediate\nregion inwards.\nHence, to lowest order in \u03bd, \u03c6 is again constant on the grain andK is equal to the\nvalue of k calculated in Sec. 3. Moreover as discussed at the end of that section, this\nresult remains true when \u03b3 is as large as \u0005\u22121\/2. However, by increasing \u03bd we narrow\nthe region between the switchover distance and the shielding distance, eventually\nreaching the case of threshold streaming.\n4.3. Case 2: threshold streaming, \u03bd \u223c O(\u0005\u02c62\/3)\nThe shielding length is once again r \u223c O(\u0005\u02c62\/3). We define\n\u03bd = (\u0005\u02c62\/3K1\/3)\u03bd\u02dc, (4.17)\nand otherwise employ the same rescalings as in (4.13) and the idea in (4.16). We\nthus find, for the lowest-order \u2018canonical\u2019 problem,\n\u2207 \u00b7 (n\u02dc0\u2207\u03a6\u02dc0) = \u22124\u03c0\u03b4(r\u02dc), (4.18a)\n1\n2 |\u2207\u03a6\u02dc0|2 + \u03c6\u02dc0 = 12 \u03bd\u02dc2, (4.18b)\n\u22072\u03c6\u02dc0 = 1 \u2212 n\u02dc0, (4.18c)\nwhere the tilde denotes rescaled variables. The matching conditions are\n\u03a6\u02dc0 \u2192 \u03bd\u02dcx\u02dc, (4.19a)\n\u03c6\u02dc0 \u2192 \u03bd\u02dcx\u02dc\nr\u02dc3\n, (4.19b)\nn\u02dc0 \u2192 1 as r\u02dc \u2192 \u221e. (4.19c)\nThus the lowest-order spherical symmetry inside the space-charge region has been\nbroken by the ion flow. Although this problem cannot be solved analytically, when\n\u03bd is sufficiently small we conjecture that the streamlines are as illustrated schem-\natically in Fig. 4.\nWe can also make some conjecture about the regime \u03bd\u0002 \u0005\u02c62\/3, corresponding to\n\u03bd\u02dc becoming large. In particular, there is reason to doubt that the ion trajectory\npattern in Fig. 4 is maintained for such values of \u03bd\u02dc, by virtue of the following\nargument.\nModelling an isolated dust grain in a plasma 15\nIt is possible to rescale (4.18) by writing\n\u03a6\u02dc0 = \u03bd\u02dc1\/2\u03a6\u02c60, (4.20a)\n\u03c6\u02dc0 = \u03bd\u02dc2\u03c6\u02c60, (4.20b)\nr\u02dc = \u03bd\u02dc\u22121\/2r\u02c6, (4.20c)\nto obtain\n\u2207 \u00b7 (n0\u2207\u03a6\u02c60) = \u22124\u03c0\u03b4(r\u02c6), (4.21a)\n1\n2 |\u2207\u03a6\u02c60|2 + \u03c6\u02c60 = 12 , (4.21b)\n\u03bd\u02dc3\u22072\u03c6\u02c60 = 1 \u2212 n0. (4.21c)\nThe matching conditions become\n\u03a6\u02c60 \u2192 x\u02c6, (4.22a)\n\u03c6\u02c60 \u2192 x\u02c6\nr\u02c63\n, (4.22b)\nn0 \u2192 1 as r\u02c6 \u2192 \u221e. (4.22c)\nWe note that the unit of distance now coincides with the switchover distance, \u0005\u02c6\u03bd\u22121\/2,\nof Sec. 4.2. When \u03bd\u02dc is large, (4.21c) yields Laplace\u2019s equation for \u03c6\u02c60, to lowest order\nin 1\/\u03bd\u02dc. Subject to (4.22b), and in the absence of quadrupoles or higher, this implies\nthat, to lowest order, we have \u03c6\u02c60 = x\u02c6\/r\u02c63. Hence we have undertaken the numerical\nexperiment of solving\n1\n2\n|\u2207\u03a6|2 + x\nr3\n=\n1\n2\n(4.23)\nin the whole domain, subject to \u03a6 \u2192 x as r \u2192 \u221e. The characteristics of this eikonal\nequation are the trajectories of the ions and they are illustrated in Fig. 5. They are\nnon-intersecting up to an envelope or \u2018caustic\u2019, but the subsequent trajectories are\nnot consistent with the original continuum model.\nWe can draw an analogy by recalling that when a thin sheet of water flows rapidly\nfrom a point source on a plane that can be tilted from the horizontal, then, above a\ncertain slope, the trajectories of the water particles will have an envelope as in Fig. 5,\nthe dipole potential being replaced by the gravitational potential on the plane; the\nenvelope is roughly parabolic downhill [20]. In this situation, the water particles\ncoalesce into a tube rather than staying in a sheet, the tube being thin but with much\nlarger cross-sectional dimensions than the thickness of the sheet. This prompts us\nto propose the following scenario for large enough values of \u03bd\u02dc: it is conceivable that,\nwhen \u03bd\u02dc is large enough, a strong axi-symmetric jet of ions is formed downstream\nof the dust particle. In this jet, the ion density per unit cross-sectional area would\nexceed the corresponding value upstream of the jet by an order of magnitude. Such\na jet, if it existed, could be modelled using the theory of delta-shocks, as described\nin [21], but we will not pursue this possibility further here.\n16 N. Arinaminpathy, J. E. Allen and J. R. Ockendon\nFigure 5. Ion trajectories in a dipole field. The scale length is \u0002\u02c6\/\u03bd1\/2.\n5. Summary\nWe have modelled a spherical grain in a stationary plasma using the ABR theory,\nwhich assumes cold, collisionless ions. We exploited the smallness of the grain size\ncompared to the electron Debye length to find matched asymptotic expansions for\nthe electric potential, the ion number density and the ion velocity. One of the main\nachievements of this asymptotic approach was the discovery of a new shielding\nlength, associated with the ABR model. It depends not only on the electron Debye\nlength but also on the grain size and the ion\u2013electron mass ratio.\nWe then considered the effect of ion streaming relative to the dust grain, a\ncommon scenario in dusty plasmas. For streaming below a certain threshold we\ndetermined matched asymptotic expansions for the electric potential, ion number\ndensity and ion velocity. To lowest order these are all spherically symmetric inside\nthe shielding distance. At threshold streaming the spherical symmetry inside the\nshielding distance is lost, and we found the resulting problem to be analytically\nintractable.\nWhen the streaming exceeds the threshold, it is possible that the ions can no\nlonger re-adjust smoothly to their free stream velocity downstream of the dust\nparticle. This leads us to speculate that they condense into a concentrated jet, but\nfurther numerical and experimental evidence is needed before this scenario can be\nproperly discussed.\nWhile sophisticated numerical calculations are undoubtedly useful, it is hoped\nthat the work in this paper demonstrates that techniques such as matched asymp-\ntotic expansions can also be valuable, and effective, in gaining new insights into the\nbehaviour of a dust particle in a plasma.\nAppendix A. Uniqueness result\nBecause (2.14) is a second-order ordinary differential equation, its general solution\nwill have two degrees of freedom. We show first how two degrees of freedom arise\nfrom the general solution of (2.14), and then how both of these degrees of freedom\nare eliminated by the given far-field boundary conditions.\nModelling an isolated dust grain in a plasma 17\nWe begin with a formal, far-field analysis. From (2.15) we can write\n\u03c6 \u223c \u2212 J\n2\n2r4\n+ \u03c6\u00af as r \u2192 \u221e, (A 1)\nwhere\n\u03c6\u00af \u223c o(r\u22124) as r \u2192 \u221e. (A 2)\nThe linearized equation for \u03c6\u00af reads\nd2\u03c6\u00af\ndr2\n+\n2\nr\nd\u03c6\u00af\ndr\n= \u2212 J\n2\n2r4\n\u2212 r\n4\nJ2\n\u03c6\u00af as r \u2192 \u221e. (A 3)\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation in \u03c6\u00af. Any particular integral\ncan be written as an inverse power series beginning with terms of O(r\u22128); to find\nthe behaviour of the complementary function as r \u2192 \u221e we write the WKB [21]\nansatz\n\u03c6\u00af \u223c A(r)e\u03c8(r) as r \u2192 \u221e, (A 4)\nwhere |\u03c8| \u2192 \u221e as r \u2192 \u221e,\n\u03c6\u00af\u2032 \u223c A\u03c8\u2032e\u03c8 + A\u2032e\u03c8, (A 5)\n\u03c6\u00af\u2032\u2032 \u223c A\u03c8\u2032\u2032e\u03c8 + A(\u03c8\u2032)2e\u03c8 + 2A\u2032\u03c8\u2032e\u03c8, (A 6)\nwhere \u2018\u2032\u2019 denotes d\/dr. Hence\n(\u03c8\u2032)2 \u223c \u2212 r\n4\nJ2\n\u21d2 \u03c8 \u223c \u00b1 ir\n3\n3J\nas r \u2192 \u221e. (A 7)\nTo find A we substitute (A 7) into (A 5) and (A 6). In turn, substituting these into\n(A 3) and retaining terms in A\u2032, we find eventually\nA\u2032r + 2A \u223c 0 \u21d2 A \u223c b\nr2\n, (A 8)\nfor a constant b. Combining this with (A 7), we have that the complementary\nfunctions are such that\n\u03c6\u00afC \u223c b+\nr2\nexp\n(\nir3\n3J\n)\n+\nb\u2212\nr2\nexp\n(\n\u2212 ir\n3\n3J\n)\nas r \u2192 \u221e, (A 9)\nwhere b+ and b\u2212 are the two arbitrary constants, which both vanish from (A2).\nIn summary, using only the information supplied by the far-field condition on n,\nwe have shown how both degrees of freedom in the overall problem are eliminated.\nThus for a given J , \u03c6(r) is also uniquely determined.\nAcknowledgements\nThe first author wishes to acknowledge financial support from EPSRC and QinetiQ.\nThe authors also wish to thank Professor Bryce McLeod for useful discussions.\nReferences\n[1] Selwyn, G.
