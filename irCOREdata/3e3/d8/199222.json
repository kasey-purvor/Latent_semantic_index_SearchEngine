If you have travelled by train in India you may\nhave met him too. He is conscious of cultural difference and wishes\nyou to understand that Indians have family values\u2014on account of\nwhich they don\u2019t go in for divorce or extra-marital sex. It was possibly\nhe who first told me (though I have read it somewhere since) that\nactuarial calculations reveal that one in three marriages in Britain,\nand one in two in the United States, is destined to end in divorce. I\nfind his contrast confirmed in a scholarly study of the subject. By\ncomparison with its \u2018alarming rate\u2019 in the West, \u2018divorce was\nunknown to the Hindu institution of marriage. Husband and wife\nwere bound to each other not only in this life, but even in the lives\nto follow\u2019 (Pothen 1986: ix).\nBut though contemporary Englishmen may well seem faithless by\nSmartha Brahman standards, it was not ever thus. Except by act of\nParliament, legal divorce with the right to remarry was not an option\nbefore 1857; and up to that date the largest number of Parliament-\nAcknowledgements: The ethnographic data discussed in this essay were collected\nover a period of approximately seventeen months\u2019 field research, undertaken at\nvarious intervals between September 1993 and April 2000.

PARRY784\nary petitions in any one year was twelve (Stone 1990: 325). Admit-\ntedly, this very low figure may have owed as much to cost as to wide-\nspread marital contentment. And admittedly, the less affluent took\nrecourse to various forms of separation and customary procedures of\ndivorce, while an incalculably larger number deserted their spouse\n(Thompson 1991; Gillis 1985). But even so, there is fairly wide con-\nsensus that England was \u2018basically a non-divorcing and non-\nseparating society\u2019, prompting Stone to suggest that the ever-\nspiralling divorce rate since has been \u2018perhaps the most profound\nand far-reaching social change to have occurred in the last five hun-\ndred years\u2019 (Stone 1990: 28; 422).\nThe man with the brief case was, I sensed, apprehensive lest India\nput an unwary foot on the same escalator, and will not have been\nreassured by the LSE Director\u2019s recent assessment of global trends\n(Giddens 1999). Not just in Islington, but the wide world over, per-\nsonal life is undergoing a revolutionary transformation in the direc-\ntion of a new ideological stress on intimacy, on the quality and equal-\nity of the relationship between the couple, and hence on the\npossibility of de-coupling when that relationship is no longer fulfilling\n(cf. Giddens 1992).1 Coming to us courtesy of BBC. Dot. Com this\ngoes as \u2018globalization\u2019, though I fancy an ancestry in old-style\n\u2018modernization\u2019.2\nBy comparison my canvas is extremely limited\u2014one small part of\nIndia over one small chunk of time, in which context I want to\n1 The title of Giddens\u2019 1992 volume\u2014The transformation of intimacy\u2014is (perhaps\ndeliberately?) ambiguous. While it on the one hand evokes his argument that intim-\nacy democratizes interpersonal relations and thereby transforms society, it also sug-\ngests that it is itself transformed. But if this second is intended, it is surprisingly\ndifficult to discover from Giddens what intimacy was before its transformation, or\neven whether it existed in conjugal life in anything more than a latent form. What\nis however clear is that in its modern manifestation, intimacy is inseparable from\nthe \u2018pure relationship\u2019, which is one based on \u2018social and emotional equality\u2019 (p. 2),\n\u2018entered into for its own sake\u2019 (p. 58) and \u2018terminated, more or less at will, by either\npartner at any particular point\u2019 (p. 137). Intimacy, equality and dissolubility thus\nseem to be inextricable aspects of the same phenomenon\u2014the \u2018pure relationship\u2019.\nIn what follows, I use \u2018intimacy\u2019 to convey the idea of familiar and affectionate\ncompanionship and the sharing of inner thoughts and feelings; and suggest that a\nnew ideological stress on its salience in conjugal relations is not invariably part of\nthe composite package which Giddens postulates.\n2 The trajectory Giddens identifies seems, for example, to have been significantly\nanticipated by Goode (1963) who argued that with industrialization the family\nforms of non-western societies would tend to converge on the Western conjugal\nmodel. This is characterized by\u2014amongst other things\u2014spouses who look to each\nother for affection and who have a relatively egalitarian relationship; and by the\npossibility of divorce and remarriage (cf. Goldthorpe 1987: 62\u20134).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 785\naddress my travelling companion\u2019s concern with the changing\nstability of marriage. What he may perhaps have overlooked is that\nit is possible to be legally married to somebody one has not seen for\nyears. We therefore need to distinguish between jural and conjugal\nstability (Schneider 1953). And if we are interested in the latter, in\nwhether the couple actually remain together, it is obvious that in\ncontemporary India the legal divorce rate is an extremely poor guide.\nThough in much of the \u2018traditional\u2019 high-caste Hindu world the jural\nrelations of marriage have indeed been very stable, it is unlikely that\nconjugal relations were ever equally so.\nLower down the social hierarchy, customary forms of divorce and\nremarriage were widely accepted. For south India in the mid-\ntwentieth century, Gough (1956), Mandelbaum (1970: 1:78) and\nDumont (1986 [1957]: 199\u2013200) drew attention to very high rates\nof marital breakdown; while from the other end of the country,\nBerreman (1963: 161\u20132) reported that in the Garhwal hills divorce\nwas \u2018taken as a matter of course\u2019, and that adultery was not a ground\nfor it and was in fact \u2018expected\u2019. Two surveys in neighbouring Jaun-\nsar-Bawar showed that around one half of all ever-married women\nhad had two or more spouses, and that a large proportion of those\nwho had not were still at an age at which remarriage was likely (Jain\n1948; cf. Majumdar 1955: 172). The recent literature has largely\nlost sight of the issue, though Unnithan-Kumar\u2019s study (1997) of the\nGirasias of Rajasthan is a valuable exception.3 Girasia women have\na reputation for sexual freedom and can initiate divorce.4 Approxim-\nately 50% of current household heads have had at least one previous\nspouse (ibid. p. 139). Another important exception is Simeran Gell\u2019s\n3 For a different part of Rajasthan, and for western U.P., see also Raheja and\nGold (1994: xxviii) who speak of divorce and remarriage as \u2018not infrequent\u2019. Sharma\n(1980: 155\u201366) offers a useful and more extended discussion for Himachal Pradesh;\nwhile Good (1991: 85) refers to the \u2018surprising number\u2019 of changes of marital part-\nner in the Tamilnadu district of Tirunelveli. Long-standing pre-marital and extra-\nmarital liaisons were also common.\n4 Rajasthan is, of course, the land of heroic Rajputs and sati\u2014than which surely\nnothing could be more powerful testimony to the indissolubility of the marriage\nbond and to a woman\u2019s envelopment in the person of her husband. Yet amongst the\nGirasias, who are sort of \u2018fringe\u2019 Rajputs, women are never incorporated into their\nhusband\u2019s lineage and their outsider status is reiterated in the most symbolically\npowerful terms. A woman brings her own utensils to the marriage and can never\nuse those belonging to her husband\u2019s lineage; can never cook for them if she comes\nfrom a lineage of slightly lower status; must weep outside her husband\u2019s compound\nfor a deceased kinsman, and is said to have no further ties with his lineage once his\nmortuary rites have been completed and should ideally leave his village at that point\n(Unnithan-Kumar 1997: 112f).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY786\nremarkable re-study of the Murias. Her ethnography\u2014which comes\nfrom the same general region\u2014has many resonances with the data\nI will come to shortly. In the village studied, only 20% had the part-\nners to whom they were originally betrothed, and more than half of\nall completed first marriages had ended in divorce (1992: 142, 129).\nThough in terms of India as a whole it is difficult to assess the demo-\ngraphic significance of these high-divorce populations, it is clear that\ncertain pockets of the country sustain divorce rates quite comparable\nto contemporary California.\nThis has significant implications for my second theme\u2014the repro-\nduction of caste through endogamous marriage. Endogamy is con-\nventionally seen as the last and most impregnable bastion of caste\nin contemporary India. True, several observers have reported some\nexpansion of endogamous boundaries to unite formerly separate\nunits of equivalent status (e.g. Kolenda 1978: 151; Mandelbaum\n1970: 2:653; Vatuk 1982). But the wider picture is held to be one\nin which, while the hierarchical ordering and interdependence of\ncastes has been greatly eroded, the stress on their separation\nremains. The most important manifestation of this, and its ultimate\nfoundation, is the continued vitality of endogamy (e.g. Kolenda\n1978: 151; Mayer 1996; Delie`ge 1997: 102, 167 and 1999: 173).5\nIn fact, Choudhury (1994, 1997) charts a marked decline in the tol-\neration of intercaste marriage over the past century. For Patterson\n(1958) endogamy is \u2018the hard core\u2019 of caste and her Maharashtrian\ninformants regarded \u2018intercaste marriage\u2019 as a contradiction in terms.\nFor the Pallars and Paraiyars in an exclusively Untouchable Tamil-\nnad village it is \u2018unthinkable\u2019 (Delie`ge 1997: 112); while Mayer\n(1996) reports in his recent re-study of Ramkheri that marriage\noutside the caste is not even regarded as a theoretical possibility and\nthat caste membership remains as unambiguous as ever. Though\nBe\u00b4teille (1996) has questioned the plausibility of this picture for the\nurban middle classes, he is forced\u2014for want of hard data\u2014to do so\non largely a priori grounds.\nFor the working class, I posit a close correlation between the\nstability of marriage and the grip of endogamy. Though the situation\n5 See also Holmstro\u00a8m (1976: 80\u20132) who provides one of the earliest, but also one\nof the most nuanced, statements of this position. Amongst the Bangalore workers\nhe studied, the hierarchical aspects of caste had lost much of their legitimacy.\n\u2018Castes are \u2018\u2018separate but equal\u2019\u2019, and the only kind of separation that really matters\nis endogamy\u2019. The actual incidence of \u2018love marriages\u2019 and cross-caste unions was\nnonetheless growing.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 787\nis subtly transformed in the modern industrial milieu, the basic logic\nis already present in Dumont\u2019s distinction between primary and sec-\nondary marriage. The primary marriage is \u2018the marriage par excel-\nlence\u2019, more strictly regulated, more expensive and prestigious (1964:\n83). Where the conjugal bond is indissoluble, it is a woman\u2019s only\nmarriage. But even when remarriage is possible, a woman (though\nnot a man) may go through only one primary marriage which is a\nprerequisite for subsequent inferior, less elaborately ritualized, mar-\nriages. While the children may sometimes be hierarchized, they are\nequally legitimate. Legitimacy distinguishes marriage from concu-\nbinage, which\u2014though socially condoned\u2014is not a ritualized union.\nIt is a matter of individual choice to which the consent of kin is\nirrelevant,6 and which may therefore involve partners of different\ncaste. Thus Good (1991: 85) reports that though intercaste marriage\nremains rare in the Tirunelveli villages he studied, \u2018many men\u2019 have\nconcubines of different caste and most important ones have at least\none such liaison. In other parts of India the lines are differently\ndrawn. Being freer, secondary marriages may also cross caste bound-\naries (e.g. Berreman 1963: 154).7 In general, \u2018the higher the type,\nthe stricter the regulation\u2019; the lower, the greater the scope for indi-\nvidual choice8\u2014and hence for intercaste unions.\nI argue that under modern conditions this correlation between\nmarital instability and intercaste marriage is strengthened. Second-\n6 As was also the case in pre-Revolutionary China. Jankowiak (1993: 195) sug-\ngests that this element of choice provided space for notions of romantic love.\n7 Berreman (1963: 156) also reports the sale of Garhwali hill women to the\nplains; while the Jefferys record that most Bijnor villages (in western U.P.) have a\nhandful of \u2018bought brides\u2019 from the sub-Himalayan region and from areas far to the\neast. These women appear to be almost invariably taken as secondary wives, and\ntheir unions are widely assumed to breach caste boundaries. Before they are brought\nback to the village, they are supposedly \u2018purified\u2019 by a bath in the Ganges\u2014enough\napparently to ensure that, though certainly looked down upon, they are regarded as\n\u2018proper\u2019 wives and that the children they bear are legitimate (Jeffery and Jeffery\n1996: 76, 179\u201380, 231\u201344). In passing, Prem Choudhury (1997) again notes an\nassociation between secondary and intercaste marriages.\n8 In the draft of an unpublished paper (referred to in 1960: 227), Mayer (n.d.)\nrecords that in two crucial respects secondary unions in Ramkheri radically depart\nfrom the rules which govern primary marriage. The couple are allowed to see each\nother before they are united, and the woman is always allowed a veto. (I am grateful\nto Adrian Mayer for making this draft available to me). Prem Choudhury (1994:\n87) documents an interesting rearguard action against the relative autonomy of\nwomen in secondary marriage for the Jats of Haryana. A widow\u2019s in-laws sought to\nrestrict her field of chioce to their patrilineage\u2014largely in order to prevent her\nshare of her deceased husband\u2019s property from passing outside their control.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY788\nary unions are increasingly likely to breach endogamous boundaries.\nBut I also show that the marital practices of the local working class\nin what was pre-industrially a high divorce area are progressively\npolarized. For those with informal sector industrial jobs, divorce\nremains as frequent as formerly and remarriage more commonly\ncrosses caste boundaries. For those with public sector employment,\na new companionate ideology of marriage9 and stress on intimacy is\naccompanied by a decline in divorce (hence a lesser likelihood of\nintercaste marriage), and by a growth in gender inequality. While\nthe first of these trends is in line with Giddens\u2019 predictions, the\nsecond and third run counter to them. In explaining all three the\nrole of state institutions is crucial.\nAnkalu\u2019s Errant Wife\nOn 23March 1994, the Hindustan Times reported a familiarly ghastly\nstory. Two teenage lovers\u2014an Ahir boy and a Saini girl\u2014had been\naxed to death in a Haryana village. Called into a closed room by her\nuncles, the girl had been judicially dispatched while the women\nlooked on through the windows. Her corpse was dumped at the\nentrance gate. Witnessed\u2014according to police sources\u2014by over a\nhundred people, the boy was cut down in the fields. No isolated case,\nsaid the investigating officer; but what really struck the reporter was\nthat the village appeared to be united behind the \u2018executioners\u2019 and\nconspired to keep the state at arm\u2019s length.10\nOn the day I read this story I was still near the start of new\nfieldwork; and that evening Somvaru11 dropped by at my house, full\nof a scandal closer to hand. As it unfolded, I became aware that the\ndistance that separates his world from this atrocity is more than\ngeographical.\n9 I use this expression in a sense rather different from Giddens (1992: 155), who\nsees \u2018companionate marriage\u2019 as a kind of attenuation of the \u2018pure relationship\u2019,\nand as characterized by a low level of sexual involvement but \u2018some degree of equal-\nity and mutual sympathy\u2019. Following Macfarlane (1986: 154), what I seek to convey\nis rather the idea that spouses should be intimate and emotionally-bonded compan-\nions, who share at least some common activities rather than inhabiting entirely\nseparate gendered spheres, who are \u2018two halves of one whole\u2019, and who can up to a\npoint reveal to the other their \u2018true self \u2019.\n10 In an important article, Prem Choudhury (1997) discusses the reactions of\nextreme violence to a number of recent cases of this kind from the same general\nregion\u2014including this instance.\n11 I use pseudonyms throughout.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 789\nSomvaru is a Satnami, the largest untouchable caste of the area.\nHe lives in the ex-village-cum-labour colony I call Girvi, which is\nlocated on the periphery of the modern purpose-built Company\nTownship of Bhilai in the Chhattisgarh region of Madhya Pradesh.\nThe company is the Bhilai Steel Plant (BSP for short), a public sector\nundertaking which was constructed with Soviet collaboration, began\nproduction in 1959, and\u2014with an area of seventeen square kilo-\nmetres and around 50,000 workers on its direct pay-roll\u2014is now one\nof the largest steel plants in Asia. A little removed from it is the\nmore recently built industrial estate with some 200 smaller-scale\nprivate sector factories. Immediately fringing the plant\u2019s perimeter\nwalls is its spacious and orderly township. Elsewhere the perimeter\nfence abuts onto what still look like rural villages; while at other\npoints the plant and the township are surrounded by a sea of unregu-\nlated urban sprawl which envelops old villages like Girvi and Patripar\nin which much of my fieldwork was done. In the mid-1950s, both\nwere small rural settlements in which a bicycle was still a wonder.\nSince that time many migrant workers from other corners of the\ncountry have moved in, the erstwhile peasants and landless labourers\nare now better described as proletarians, and the lucky ones have\njobs in the steel plant. Lucky because the BSP workforce is the local\naristocracy of labour, enjoying pay, perks and benefits that make\nthem the envy of every other working class family in the area (Parry\n1999a, 2000).\nThe principal characters in the drama of which Somvaru told me\nthe start that evening were Ankalu, Ankalu\u2019s wife and their neigh-\nbour, Kedarnath. Its narrator is really Somvaru, my source of almost\ndaily briefings. Of Somvaru more later; though it helps to know that\nhe is the bhandari of the Girvi Satnami Para\u2014the functionary who\npresides at Satnami life-cycle rituals and has the role of first amongst\nequals in their quarter\u2019s panchayat. A few years his junior, and thus\nin his mid-fifties, Ankalu looked older, having lost most of his teeth,\nand one of his eyes in an accident in the BSP Coke Ovens. Before\nBSP the family were landless. But from his compensation money and\nthe Provident Fund payout he received on retirement, Ankalu had\npurchased two and a half acres of paddy land and had a deposit\naccount in the bank. With soaring real estate values in the area\naround Girvi, that made him a man of property who could indulge\nhis appetite for chicken and country liquor. His much younger, and\nstunningly attractive wife, was his third. The first had borne him a\ndaughter and three sons who were now young adults. Still childless,\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY790\nthe latest wife had had three or four husbands before him. Kedar-\nnath is another BSP Coke Oven worker and another Satnami.\nOn the night in question Ankalu and Kedarnath were sleeping out\nin the street. Around 2.0am Kedarnath got up and climbed over\nAnkalu\u2019s compound wall to join the latter\u2019s wife. Coming back, his\nsilhouette was spotted by Dakshin, who went to investigate. Kedar-\nnath pleaded his discretion, to which Dakshin was disinclined by the\ncircumstance that his own brother\u2019s wife had previously run off with\nKedarnath. An enormous hullabaloo ensued. The whole para\n(quarter) was woken; Ankalu\u2019s sons manhandled the wife, confis-\ncated her jewellery and turned her out of the house; and the kotval\nwas summoned\u2014the village watchman whose duties include\nreporting misdemeanours to the police.\nA couple of evenings later, a panchayat meeting was called but\nbroke up in inconclusive chaos. It would have to meet again. In the\ninterim I encountered the errant wife on two occasions in Somvaru\u2019s\nhouse. On the first, he informed her that Ankalu refused to have her\nback. She seemed philosophical. The second was more emotionally\ncharged. Her mother had died when she was young. She could not\nget on with her stepmother and was not welcome in her father\u2019s\nhouse. Perhaps she should move in with Kedarnath? Somvaru was\ndiscouraging. Was she really prepared to live as a co-wife? In that\ncase, suicide. Somvaru told her not to be silly. She could always work\nas a contract labourer and \u2018make\u2019 a new man.\nIn the meantime, Ankalu was at one moment saying that he would\ntake her back; at the next that he would never do so. The day after\nthe first panchayat meeting, his wife\u2019s mother\u2019s brother and father\u2019s\nfather arrived in the village, ostensibly in ignorance of their kinswo-\nman\u2019s shame which they learnt about in a tea-shop up the road. They\nwere about to turn home when Ankalu, who had heard of their\narrival, sent word that there was no reason for them to fall out over\na loose woman, and that they should join him in chicken and daru\n(liquor). For his part, Somvaru was advising Ankalu to condone his\nwife\u2019s conduct, put her up for a time in Bhata Para (a new hamlet\non the periphery of the village inhabited mainly by outsider contract\nlabourers) and then take her back when things had blown over.\nMeanwhile again, Ankalu\u2019s sons were stomping about the village\nthreatening to bathe in Kedarnath\u2019s blood next time he crossed their\npath. Somvaru was scathing. \u2018They always say that. But we Chhattis-\ngarhis don\u2019t have the courage for that kind of thing\u2019. And a good job\ntoo, he would often imply\u2014the capacity to keep a \u2018cold brain\u2019 (thanda\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 791\ndimag), over women especially, being a positive value for old-timers\nlike him. In any event, he was right. Within a couple of days of\nthe scandal breaking I would see Kedarnath sitting shunned, but\nunmolested, at his door.\nBy the second panchayat, his sons had stiffened Ankalu\u2019s resolve.\nHis wife was sent away. Mounted on powerful motorbikes, next\nmorning Ankalu roared off with five friends around the peripheral\nvillages in search of a new one. In each a fortifying drink and the\nparty would call on the bhandari to ask if koi rarhi-chharve baithi hai,\nkya (\u2018Is there any widow or abandoned woman sitting here?\u2019). But as\nSomvaru had warned, it was not that easy and these sorties con-\ntinued for several weeks. Sometimes the search was combined with\none for a bride for his son and nephew, enquiries about which were\nhopefully concluded with: Aur mere laik koi hai? (\u2018And is there anyone\nsuitable for me?\u2019). Several times the posse was directed to a tempor-\narily husbandless woman \u2018sitting\u2019 in her maike (her natal home) only\nfor her to declare she would consider the proposition if Ankalu would\nregister some land in her name, for where would she be if he died\nor divorced her? Once he sought out his second wife to ask if she\nwould return, but was angrily sent packing. Once, when Somvaru\u2019s\nalcoholic eldest son went along, the prospective bride said that she\nwould have him but not the one-eyed old fellow (dokra). And indeed\nthe errant wife had already put it about that she would never have\ncome had she realized which of the group she was getting. Despond-\nent, Ankalu told his sons that since it was at their insistence that he\nturned his wife out, it was now up to them to find him a replacement.\nIf they wouldn\u2019t he would have the old one back.\nBy mid-May he had resolved to do so. He found her at her father\u2019s\nhouse, gave her money and sent her to stay with the brother of his\nfirst wife, the mother\u2019s brother of his sons. The plan was that if he\nbrought her back and begged them to accept her, they would not be\nable to refuse. But as it transpired, they were. The one who was\nshortly to marry led the opposition. There was no way he would bring\na new bride to live with that woman. If his father insisted on keeping\nher, he must do so away from home. Somvaru claimed to be puzzled.\nWhy was Ankalu so abject? Who had the bank balance and who\nowned the land? Part of the answer, as we shall see, is that these\nupwardly mobile modern young men with new-fangled ideas about\nmarriage increasingly occupy the moral high ground.\nBut to conclude the story, the errant wife was put to lodge with a\nfamily in Bhata Para.

PARRY792\nplace of her own in the hamlet and started work as a contract\nlabourer. The outraged husband was now a wooer, going to the\nneighbouring house of a hunchback dwarf where the two of them\nwould drink and cook chicken to send her. But soon the gossip got\nback to Ankalu. Kedarnath was paying her visits. She was com-\nplaining that Ankalu\u2019s sons were eating the fruits of her labour on\nhis land \u2018like it was shit\u2019. When sympathetic neighbours suggested\nshe beat Ankalu for his drunken disorderliness, she said \u2018If you kill\na fish, your hand stinks\u2019. Fired up by all this, Ankalu was back on his\nmotorbike. But by July, the wife had returned to live in an empty\nhouse in the main village which Ankalu would visit at night. Eighteen\nmonths later she ran off with her very first husband. Ankalu took\nPrithvi on one of his trips to persuade her to return. They had been\ndrinking; their motorbike came off the road and Ankalu sustained\ninjuries from which he later died.\nThe contrasting reactions in these two episodes, you might reason-\nably suppose, is explained by the fact that in the Haryana atrocity\nthe caste status of those involved was more elevated and the affair\nwas between an unmarried girl and a boy of different\u2014and lower\u2014\ncaste.12 But I think that is only a part of the picture. Certainly,\nChhattisgarhis are less tolerant of pre-marital affairs, especially of\nthose that cut across caste; and the higher castes claim to be more\nsexually straight-laced than Satnamis. Even so, the moral outrage\nand ready recourse to violent sanctions against sexual impropriety\nseem much more muted. A second contrast concerns the state\u2014in\nthe one case a sullen determination to prevent it from poking its\nnose into matters of village honour, in the other an immediate sum-\nmons to the government-appointed village constable.13 More striking\n12 Sainis claim superiority to Ahirs, and the boy was branded an \u2018upstart\u2019\n(Choudhury 1997). It is striking that in all the most extreme cases of violence\ndirected at an intercaste couple which Choudhury refers to, the girl appears to have\nbeen previously unmarried and the union hypogamous. Choudhury\u2019s interpretation of\nthis violence places particular emphasis on the threat to patriarchal interest of a\ndaughter\u2019s right to inherit. But while this is no doubt an important element, it\nplainly does not explain the contrast with Chhattisgarh, where women\n(theoretically) enjoy the same legal entitlements.\n13 I do not intend an absolute contrast, for in any one instance there are likely\nto be some whose interests are served by involving the state and others who wish\nto keep it at bay. In the two different regions, however, there does appear to be a\nsignificant difference in the balance achieved between these two opposing pulls. The\nHaryana violence which Choudhury discusses has a highly collective character, and\nthe \u2018executions\u2019 were in some sense \u2018spectacles\u2019 for the \u2018edification\u2019 of the entire\nvillage.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 793\nstill is the different role of the generations: in the one case the judges\nand executioners were the family gerontocrats; in the other the\nchampions of morality were lads barely out of their teens.\nDivorce and Remarriage in Chhattisgarh\nTwo major fissures run through the social order of the ex-villages-\ncum-labour colonies in which I worked. The first is between the local\nChhattisgarhis and immigrants from outside the region. The second\nis within Chhattisgarhi society, between the so-called \u2018Hindu\u2019 castes\nand the Satnamis, who are descendants of Chamar untouchable con-\nverts to the sectarian following of a saint called Ghasi Das. Though\nmost Satnami belief and ritual is shared with the other castes, and\nthough people concede that Satnamis are Hindus \u2018by religion\u2019, they\nsay that \u2018by caste\u2019 they are not. The \u2018Hindu\u2019 castes to whom they are\nopposed account for more or less every other in the village hierarchy,\nincluding some also regarded as untouchables in the past. The exclu-\nsion to which they were subject was, however, considerably less rigor-\nous than that applied to Satnamis.14\nThe category \u2018Hindu\u2019 thus covers an extremely broad spectrum,\nand the separation between castes within it was in the days before\nthe steel plant unusually stringent. In many instances the only\npeople with whom one would inter-dine were those of one\u2019s own\ncaste. Today, in places like Girvi and Patripar, members of all \u2018Hindu\u2019\ncastes eat together in a single unbroken line (pangat) on occasions\nlike marriage. But still no Satnami is ever invited. So while the bar-\nriers that once separated the \u2018Hindu\u2019 castes from each other appear\nincreasingly permeable, the one which divides \u2018Hindus\u2019 from Sat-\nnamis remains substantially intact and is thrown into sharper relief\n(Parry 1999b). Something of the same shift, as I will later show, is\nrepeated in marriage.\nWhile it is true that Satnami marriages are less stable, the gap is\nexaggerated by high caste discourse. Almost all castes traditionally\ntolerate divorce and remarriage.15 There is, however, one now dis-\n14 For a more detailed discussion of the Hindu\/Satnami divide, see Dube 1998\nand Parry 1999b.\n15 In Girvi and Patripar, the only exception were the Brahmans\u2014in each case a\nsolitary family which provided the village with its priestly maharaj.

PARRY794\ntinctively Satnami practice which signals a difference in ideological\nemphasis. Brahmanical theory constructs marriage as kanya dan\u2014\n\u2018the gift of a virgin\u2019. The \u2018virgin\u2019 (kanya) is given as dan, a unilateral\nprestation which the donor alienates absolutely and for which no\nreturn can be accepted. In flat contradiction, the Satnamis take\nbride-price (sukh dam\u2014\u2018the price of happiness\u2019). As a concession to\nBrahmanical norms, the sum is now fixed at a trifling level16 and\npropriety requires that most of it is handed back. But the crucial\npoint is that, however trivial the amount, something is retained.\nWere it not, the girl would be kanya dan. Members of her household\nwould not be able to accept food in her married home and she would\nnot be able to return to her natal home if the marriage turned out\nbadly\u2014for dan must never come back to the donor. In short, the\nSatnamis explicitly repudiate the theory which objectifies women as\nalienable gifts.\nBut though the \u2018Hindu\u2019 castes pay lip-service to that theory, it is\nwhispered that they too took bride-price in the past, while today they\nregularly subvert the ideology of kanya dan by divorce, and by\nexchange marriages (guravat) in which a sister is given for a wife and\nthe need for dowry is obviated. For Chhattisgarhis, however, dowry\nhas yet to become the drain on family resources that it is else-\nwhere\u2014though amongst BSP workers, the emulation of outsiders has\nconsiderably inflated the outlay required. But it is still the case that\na Chhattisgarhi with a regular job in the plant would spend on a\ndaughter\u2019s marriage no more than half, and could possibly get away\nwith as little as a quarter, of what would be de rigeur for his Malayali,\nPunjabi or Bihari colleague.\nIn the urban areas today, at the time of marriage a boy is likely\nto be between twenty and thirty, a girl between fifteen and twenty-\nfive. By contrast, many people over forty were first married as chil-\ndren\u2014often so young that they do not remember the event.

In the area\naround Bhilai I never encountered indigenous Rajputs, and the Banias are mainly\nconfined to the towns.\n16 In the past the amount was negotiable but would have invariably represented\na significant sacrifice. Today each village sets its own fixed rate\u2014in Girvi Rs 161.\nThis is divded into Rs 101 at the wedding ritual (shadi) and Rs 60 for the subsequent\ngauna.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 795\nwas ready for gauna17\u2014at which she was ritually given into the cus-\ntody of her husband and the marriage consummated. These days,\nshadi (the wedding proper) and gauna are usually run together.\nChild marriage is plainly intended to ensure that a girl is married\nbefore she is sexually active.18 Marriage, as Somvaru put it, is \u2018for\nlifting the weight of virginity\u2019 (kunvar bhar utarne ke liye)19\u2014which\nbears principally on the parents, who must make reparation to the\ncaste panchayat if their daughter elopes. It is a \u2018liberation from (the)\nbondage\u2019 (bandhan se mukti) of parental responsibility. In parts of \u2018tra-\nditional\u2019 Chhattisgarh a pre-pubescent girl was married to an arrow\nor rice-pounder. Only after maturity was she given to a human hus-\nband. The token pre-puberty marriage was essential to \u2018ripen\u2019 and\n\u2018de-sacralise\u2019 her body. If she menstruated or had sex before it she\nwas permanently defiled, and was unable to marry with full rites or\nparticipate fully in community ritual. But after the mock marriage,\nher sexual lapses were treated \u2018as those of a married woman\u2019\u2014that\nis, as peccadilloes (Dube 1953; cf. Hira Lal 1926).20\nWhile in the Bhilai area a girl was (generally21) married to a real\ngroom, he might just as well have been a token in that they would\n17 The dialect term is pathauni, but gauna is more generally used by my urbanized\ninformants.\n18 Echoing Brahmanical theory, I have occasionally been told that in the past a\ngirl was not regarded as a true kunvari (\u2018virgin\u2019 or \u2018unmarried female\u2019) once she had\nbegun to menstruate. She had \u2018gone astray from the path of religion\u2019\n(dharam-bhrasht).\n19 I have often pressed Somvaru and others to elaborate further on this tantaliz-\ningly suggestive but somewhat opaque pronouncement, but failed to elicit the\nexegetical treasures it seems to promise.\n20 Though Dube\u2019s short note is regularly cited in the secondary literature, Hira\nLal\u2019s earlier account has gone largely unnoticed. One significant difference in\nemphasis between them is that Dube reports that the girl is subsequently married\nto a human husband with full rites, while Hira Lal\u2019s examples suggest that this\nmarriage generally takes the form of a minimally ritualized secondary union.\n21 In the villages around Bhilai, I have heard of young girls being occasionally\nmarried to a mango tree or plantain\u2014though I know of no actual instances. This\nwas said to happen when the girl was subject to some inauspicious influence which\nwould harm her husband\u2014the token acting as a kind of lightening-conductor for\nthe subsequent human partner. I do, however, have two quite detailed case histories\nof men who are married to objects\u2014in one case to a knife (katari), and in the other\nto a kind of pot (karsa). The latter contains the paraphernalia of a married woman\n(bangles, vermilion, bindi, blouse etc.), and is kept carefully swaddled in white cloth,\nbound round with wire and suspended out of harm\u2019s way in his rafters. These pre-\ncautions are necessary lest this \u2018real\u2019 wife should get broken. Were that to happen,\nhe would have to perform the full set of funeral obsequies for it. It was because of\nthis danger that he had unsuccessfully petitioned the Washerman caste elders to\nbe married instead to a knife\u2014as is the other man (an Oilpresser) whose story I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY796\nnot consummate their union for years. In the meantime one or both\nmight embark on a secret liaison. Such affairs were almost expected,\nand it was common to abscond before gauna. Though some people\nsay that the parents of a girl who eloped at this stage were still\nresponsible, others deny this on the grounds that while \u2018the kunvari\n(\u2018\u2018virgin\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018unmarried girl\u2019\u2019) is the property (sanpatti) of her father,\nthe married woman is that of her in-laws\u2019. Provided that he is also\nof their caste, the latter can claim divorce-compensation from her\nlover.22 But either way, there is unanimity that after her shadi has\nbeen celebrated, a girl is no longer a kunvari, and her affairs did not\noccasion the scandal they would if she were.23 The \u2018weight of virgin-\nheard. Assuming these objects survive without loss or breakage, they will be dis-\nposed of along with their \u2018husband\u2019s\u2019 corpse, and their funeral rites performed in\nconjunction with his. The crucial point is that in all such cases the man is an unwed-\nded kunvara who has not previously passed through a primary marriage, but who has\ntaken a widow or divorced woman as his wife. If only to a token, he must at some\npoint undergo a \u2018proper\u2019 marriage, for \u2018a man too must have tel-haldi once in his\nlife\u2019 (a key sequence in the primary marriage at which the bodies of the bride and\ngroom are rubbed with oil and turmeric). \u2018If he does not, he will wander as a ghost\nafter death.\u2019 Dube (1996) reports that it is for this reason that a male corpse may\nbe married to an object before its cremation or burial. Apart from Dube\u2019s brief\nfootnote, the marriage of men to objects has not\u2014as far as I am aware\u2014been previ-\nously reported, and it seems to shed a rather different light on the pre-puberty\ntoken marriages of girls from that which is conventional in the literature. I plan to\nelaborate on this theme in a subsequent publication.\n22 That even before gauna, it is a married woman\u2019s in-laws who are primarily\nresponsible for her sexual conduct is illustrated by the case of Somvaru\u2019s daughter,\nJanaki, whose story I come to in the final section of this paper (and discuss in more\ndetail in Parry, forthcoming). On Janaki\u2019s mother\u2019s tragic death, her father-in-law\ntried to insist that her gauna be celebrated immediately. His reported grounds were\nthat there was now no adult woman in the household to supervise her behaviour,\nand that it was his reputation that was at stake \u2018if anything happened\u2019.\nThe residual responsibility of the parents is, however, illustrated by a case of\nwhich I learned from an elder of the Oilpressers\u2019 district-level caste panchayat. In\nthe normal case, he explained, a married daughter\u2019s parents would not be liable for\npunishment if she ran away before gauna; but in this instance the panchayat had\nsuspected their complicity. The father had appointed a date for his daughter\u2019s fare-\nwell, but when the groom\u2019s party arrived to claim her, the girl was missing and\nthe father affected ignorance of her whereabouts. A village-level panchayat was\nsummoned, at which the son-in-law\u2019s side demanded to be given \u2018their goods\u2019\n(hamara mal do). No resolution was arrived at, either there or at the intermediate-\nlevel \u2018area (kshetra) panchayat\u2019, and so the case was forwarded to them. Their ruling\nwas that since the bride\u2019s side had been uncooperative in locating her, they should\nbe held responsible for paying divorce-compensation (bihat) to her husband.\n23 There is, however, an important ideological distinction between a married\nwoman who has already passed through gauna and one who has not. One who is\nwidowed after gauna rates as an inauspicious rar.i, has her bangles broken, and can\nnever remarry with full rites or play a key role in auspicious rituals. By contrast, a\nwoman whose husband dies before gauna is classified as a barendi. A barendi does not\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 797\nity\u2019, in other words, seems to have borne on her parents principally\nup to the point of shadi rather than gauna, and to have had little to\ndo with delivering a physically intact bride to a husband for life.\nRather than manifesting an obsession with controlling the sexual\npurity of women in a world in which it is primarily through women\nthat caste status is preserved\u2014as Yalman (1963) and more recently\nGood (1991: 231\u20132) and Dube (1996) have argued\u2014pre-puberty\nmarriage in Chhattisgarh (whether real or token) appears to have\npermitted a liberation of female sexuality.24 In any event it seems a\nlittle perverse to argue that a chronic anxiety about caste purity\nforces fathers to marry off their five year-olds if they then allow their\nfifteen year-olds so much scope for fun. In fact, as we shall see, caste\nis not principally transmitted through women; and the apparently\nself-evident hypothesis, which associates pre-puberty marriage with\nan overwhelming preoccupation with the perpetuation of caste\nstatus, seems somewhat unconvincing.\nAs all this suggests, the collapsing of shadi and gauna into one has\nconsiderably added to \u2018the weight of virginity\u2019. The bride is now a\nyoung woman by the time of her shadi and will join her husband\nimmediately. Husbands therefore expect to get virgins; and fathers\nfind responsibility for a daughter\u2019s virtue more burdensome. It is one\nthing to guarantee that of a toddler; another that of a girl of twenty.\nThis was brought home to me when Bhushan Satnami\u2019s daughter\nwas about to get married, a magnificent match and a triumph of\nSomvaru\u2019s diplomacy. But it all came close to grief when the pro-\nspective groom\u2019s father\u2019s sister\u2019s husband approached Somvaru to\nsuggest a medical test of virginity. \u2018When\u2019, as he put it, \u2018the rahar\n(dal) grows big, the cow will sometimes mount the embankment.\nThe girl has been big for some time\u2019.25\nThough by comparison with marital desertion, pre-marital elope-\nment is both rare and disgraceful, it is certainly not unknown. Madan\nLal is another Girvi Satnami and another BSP worker. When he\nlearned that his daughter was five months pregnant by a Mahar who\nbreak her bangles, retains her status as a suhargan (an auspiciously married woman)\nand is remarried with full rites. All things being equal, a man would sooner take a\nbarendi or chhar.ve (an abandoned woman) in secondary marriage than a rar.i, on\naccount of her inauspiciousness and ritual incapacity. Now shadi and gauna are gen-\nerally combined, barendi status is rare.\n24 As plainly also did the celebrated tali-tying rite of the Nayars (on interpreta-\ntions of which see Fuller 1976).\n25 Mer. men jab rahar bar.a hojata hai, kabhi kabhi gaya charh jata hai.

Kanhaiya remained in the village, and three days after the\nelopement I passed him pushing his handcart\u2014rather provocatively\nI thought\u2014through the Satnami Para, wearing his dark glasses and\ntrilby hat, the loudspeakers mounted on his barrow blaring out a\nBollywood song. Four months later, both Madan\u2019s sons were unprob-\nlematically married within the caste, and his daughter gave birth to\na daughter outside it. When I went back the next year, it was clear\nthat Kanhaiya was tiring of the relationship. He had found mother\nand baby somewhere to live in an outlying village to which he was\nnow an increasingly infrequent visitor. By the following year, both\nhe and the girl had been conventionally married within their own\ncaste. Kanhaiya had enlisted the aid of a Satnami roadside bicycle\nrepairman who had found Madan\u2019s daughter an impoverished hus-\nband from his distant village to whom Kanhaiya had paid a substan-\ntial inducement. She now has child by this man; and the young family\nhave come to live in Girvi\u2019s Bhata Para from where she can walk\nwithin minutes to her father\u2019s house\u2014which she regularly does. As\nthe saying is, \u2018If a child shits on your feet, you do not cut them off\u2019.\nThe Patripar Barber introduced me to another useful adage which\nbrings out the sexually liberating nature of shadi, and the contrast\nbetween primary and secondary marriage: kunvari beti panch ke, chhar.ve\nbeti man ke (\u2018the virgin daughter belongs to the caste panchayat, the\nabandoned daughter follows her own disposition\u2019).26 \u2018After making the\nseven circumambulations (of the marriage fire)\u2019, he elaborated, \u2018a\ngirl is free\u2019.27 The difference is marked in everyday speech.

But if she\ndoes it too often, or if he does not like her, he may just let her\nmoulder in her maike. And if she does not like him, she will refuse\nto return. In either event, it is time to find someone new. As this\nsuggests, a woman retains rights of refuge in her natal home, her\nrelationship with which is much more durable than the marriage\nbond.29 But although her right of return is unquestioned, it is not\nexpected to be permanent, and her parents will encourage her to\nmake a new husband lest she shame them by conceiving without\none. Her first husband (her bihata30) should then go to demand of\nher new one a payment (bihat) which is handed over \u2018to break the\nmarriage bond\u2019 (bihati torna).31) But today many men are ashamed\n28 Wrists without bangles are the key symbol of widowhood, and a widow is\neuphemistically referred to as having \u2018empty hands\u2019 (khali hath). When new bangles\nare put on, care must be taken that the last of the old ones is not broken before at\nleast one of the new is in place.\n29 In line with the theory that blood ties are immutable, an adopted child canmarry\ninto the gotra of its adopted father but never into its gotra of birth (assuming of course\nthat these are different). The same goes for a step-child. Again, there is nothing to\nprevent a woman from taking a subsequent husband from the gotra of a previous part-\nner. It is the pull of consanguineal ties which explains why adoption is not a solution\nto the problem of childlessness. A boy is always drawn back to his natural father.\nThe situation I describe is consistent with the correlation which Kolenda (1987a\n[1967]) finds between the strength of a woman\u2019s continuing bonds with her natal\nfamily and her bargaining power, and between these and a high rate of divorce and\na low incidence of joint families. (The only surprise is to find Durg identified in a\nlater paper [1987b] as a district particularly low on divorce and high on joint\nfamilies). See also the comments of Raheja and Gold (1994: 76) on the way in\nwhich the ties of a wife to her maike provide her with scope for resisting her in-laws;\nDyson and Moore (1983) on the correlation between the strength of such ties,\nfemale autonomy and the demographic regime; and Choudhury (1994: 316\u201317) on\nthe heightened importance given to the brother\u2013sister tie by a woman\u2019s reliance on\nher natal family to arrange her remarriage in the event of widowhood or divorce.\n30 The bihata is alternatively referred to as a woman\u2019s shadi-vala. Reciprocally, a\nwife taken in a primary marriage is a man\u2019s bihai or shadi-vali.\n31 The explanation I was generally offered is that the husband is entitled to bihat\nas part reimbursement for his marriage expenses, even if it was he who ended the\nunion. The amount to which he is entitled is supposedly one half of his costs, and a\nwoman\u2019s third husband should pay the second half of what he had paid the first.\nThe third husband will know how much this was since the exact sum will have\nbeen specified in an affidavit drawn up on stamped legal paper in which the bihata\nacknowledges the end of his rights in the woman. But with him the buck stops, and\nhe can obtain no payment from a fourth husband.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY800\nto claim such compensation, the proper use of which is to fund a\nfeast known as marti-jiti bhat (\u2018the rice meal of the living-dead\u2019) which\nsignifies that for him that wife is now dead. No relationship between\nthem remains, and a woman is widowed only after the death of the\nhusband with whom she currently lives.\nThere is no distinction of status between the children of a primary\nand secondary marriage. Both are equally the product of their\nfather\u2019s seed, which is why it is to him that they theoretically belong\nin the event of divorce. In practice, however, small children fre-\nquently go with their mother to her maike, and when she remarries\nare subsequently brought up in the house of a stepfather or are left\nwith maternal grandparents. While girls are commonly written-off\nby their fathers, boys are likely to return eventually to claim their\nshare of the paternal property. But much depends on individual\ncircumstance.32\nThough this theory that bihat is compensation for marriage expenses was clearly\nalready present in the colonial period (Russell 1916: 2:411), I suspect that for the\narea around Bhilai it might be a relatively recent rationalization designed to paper\nover the now disreputable fact that in the not too-distant past the Hindu castes also\npaid bride-price, which in case of marital break-down had to be in part returned\n(this being the way in which some elderly Satnamis still represent it). In any event,\nthe current theory seems incoherent in that it does not explain why the man, and\nnot the woman, is entitled to reimbursement. The costs incurred by her family at\nmarriage exceed those of the groom\u2019s. I also suspect that other salient details are\nnew. Several rural informants have told me that the rate is not fixed, and that it is\nonly payable to a bihata and not to subsequent husbands, and then only if it is the\nwife who has run off (and not the husband who has turned her out). At least amongst\nthe Satnamis of this area, marti-jiti bhat also appears to be an innovation. Somvaru\nwas not expected to hold such a feast after he had been \u2018to break the marriage\nbond\u2019 with the first of his wives.\n32 Both Somvaru\u2019s fourth and fifth wives, for example, brought with them a young\ndaughter whom he raised and got married, who continue to be regular visitors to\nhis house and to whose own households he extends significant material support. At\nthe time of her marriage, an invitation was sent to the real father of the younger\nof these girls, though there had been no contact with him for years. He is said to\nhave been too ashamed to come himself, but sent his son by a subsequent union as\nhis representative. The mother of Somvaru\u2019s second son\u2019s wife had left her first\nhusband on account of their desperate poverty and their daughter was also brought\nup by a step-father. One day her real father unwittingly arrived at Somvaru\u2019s. He\nrapidly established the connection and summoned his daughter-in-law to touch her\nfather\u2019s feet. At first she refused. For years he had not even asked after her. And\nthen there is Somvaru\u2019s half-brother\u2019s daughter, whose truck-driver husband\ndeserted her, and who has brought her son back to live with her parents. The hus-\nband has had other women and children and has not seen his son since he left. But\nnot all fathers are so feckless. Bhushan reclaimed his daughter by his first wife and\narranged her marriage.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 801\nSome \u2018Quantitative Gossip\u201933\nAmong the Satnamis of Girvi and Patripar, almost half of all primary\nmarriages have been terminated by divorce.34 The vast majority\nremarry, often more than once (and in one case eight times). My\naggregate estimate for the \u2018Hindu\u2019 castes is that between one-\nquarter and one-third of all primary marriages end in divorce.35\nWhat these gross estimates conceal, however, is a generational vari-\nation. Sixty-one per cent of Satnamis aged 45 or over had been\ndivorced. For those under 45, the figure is 39%.36 Since marriage is\n33 I borrow this phrase from E. P. Thompson (1991: 416). Many hours spent poring\nover census forms and genealogies have served to remind me how soft \u2018hard\u2019 data can\nbe. Some of the difficulties with the statistical analysis of divorce rates in \u2018traditional\u2019\nsocieties are usefully reviewed in an early paper by Barnes (1967). By including the\nwhole universe of ever-married people in the sample, one obviously biases it in the\ndirection of a greater stability than really exists, since many of those counted have not\nyet had time to divorce. But by restricting the sample to completed marriages, one\nobscures the changes which might be occurring in the younger generation (which is\nof particular interest in the present instance). With regard to India, there are also\nconsiderable difficulties over the reliability of the data. Though by sub-continental\nstandards, Chhattisgarhis strike me as remarkably open on such matters, they know\nvery well that most of the outsiders they encounter look down on their laxity and not\nunnaturally avoid revealing its true extent. Moreover, many marriages are so short-\nlived, and of such limited significance to anybody but the couple themselves (and some-\ntimes, one suspects, even to them) that their existence may be forgotten rather than\nsuppressed. OfMangal Satnami\u2019s five wives, for example, only two remained with him\nfor as much as a year. His shadi-vali stayed only one night after gauna before running\nhome next morning. In the face of these difficulties I have concentrated on the genea-\nlogies and census returns of the caste groups I know best, and focused on the propor-\ntion of primarymarriages which end in divorce.\n34 Of the 123 Girvi Satnamis for whom I have marital histories, for example, 60\nare no longer with their original partner. This is a sub-set of the 220 ever-married\nindividuals belonging to the 79 Satnami households of the para. This proportion is\nhigher than that suggested by Prakasam\u2019s survey (1993: 173) of Satnami house-\nholds in a rural village in the neighbouring district of Raipur where around one-fifth\nof all extant unions were secondary marriages (43 out of 223 couples).\n35 This estimate is based on a sample of 254 marriages recorded on genealogies\nand household survey forms for five of the \u2018Hindu\u2019 castes represented in Girvi and\nPatripar: Kurmis (Farmers), Tamrakars (Coppersmiths), Telis (Oilpressers), Kostas\n(Weavers) and Mahars (Village watchmen and agriculturalists). These are roughly\nrepresentative of the different levels of the old \u2018Hindu\u2019 hierarchy (cf. Parry 1999b).\nMy limited numerical data does not point to any significant correlation between\ncaste status within the \u2018Hindu\u2019 category and the rate of divorce.\n36 Of the 123 Girvi Satnamis referred to in footnote 34, I calculate that 56 would\nfall into the senior age cohort and 67 into the junior cohort. From the first category,\n34 (60.7%) were no longer with their original spouse; and from the second category\n26 (38.8%). But these figures can be taken only as approximations since older\npeople are often vague about their age.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY802\nmost fragile in its earliest years, I think it unlikely that this differ-\nence is simply an artefact of age. Marriage is becoming more\nstable\u2014in a certain segment of the working class. Amongst those with\ncasual informal sector employment, divorce is as common in the\nyounger as in the older cohort; and is associated with a high propor-\ntion of female-headed households37 and a small amount of casual\nprostitution. But amongst the aristocracy of labour there is a signi-\nficant shift. Of 98 Satnami BSP workers and retired workers from\nGirvi and Patripar, almost exactly two-thirds (67%) of those aged\nover 45 had divorced and remarried (slightly more than this group\nas a whole). But of those under 45, only one-quarter (26%) have\ndone so (which is appreciably fewer than their informal sector peers).\nThough these figures are only suggestive, they square with the gen-\neral perception that \u2018educated\u2019 youngsters have learned more \u2018civil-\nized\u2019 ways.\nBy high caste north Indian standards, Chhattisgarhi women dis-\nplay a shocking want of submissiveness, and often take the initiative\nin the break-up of marriage. A Muslim woman in late middle age,\nnow married to a Maharashtrian neo-Buddhist, explained that a new\nhusband keeps a woman feeling young, and it is only when she gets\nold and tired that she settles for what she has got. An excessively\nindependent and assertive wife, however, risks being labelled a witch\n(tonhi) and on that account turned out. Sometimes the poverty of her\nhusband\u2019s household prompts a woman to leave. As a reason for\ndivorce, however, childlessness is undoubtedly the most important.\nPatience is limited if a bride does not conceive in the first couple of\nyears, or if she bears only girls. It is, above all, sons who stabilize\nmarriages. Though male informants concede the theoretical possibil-\nity that the absence of children may result from the infertility of the\nman, in practice the woman is blamed. But women know otherwise,\nand it is this\u2014I strongly suspect\u2014which precipitates a number of\nextra-marital affairs, undertaken in a search for more potent seed.38\n37 In Patripar around 20% of the total.\n38 I originally inferred this from gossip about the increasingly brazen and desper-\nate affairs of a couple of long-married childless women from families I knew. When\nI later put the hypothesis to one of the few women with whom I felt I could discuss\nit without risk of misunderstanding, I was assured of its plausibility. In corrobora-\ntion, Das\u2019s (1988) report of a Punjabi woman advising her childless sister-in-law \u2018to\nchange her quilt\u2019 (i.e. her sleeping partner) might be cited. Gold similarly discusses\nRajasthani folk-songs and traditions which associate fertility with infidelity, which\nrepresent \u2018a lover as a boon to a barren woman\u2019, and which even suppose that the\nhusband\u2019s desire for children may encourage his complicity (in Raheja and Gold\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 803\nIn Chhattisgarh, wrote Russell at the beginning of this century,\n. . . marriage ties are of the loosest description, and adultery is scarcely\nrecognised as an offence. A woman may go and live openly with another\nman and her husband will take her back afterwards. Sometimes, when two\nmen are in the relation of Mahaprasad or nearest friend to each other . . .\nthey will each place his wife at the other\u2019s disposal. The Chamars (now\nSatnamis) justify this carelessness of the fidelity of their wives by the saying,\n\u2018If my cow wanders and comes home again, shall I not let her into the stall?\u2019\n(Russell 1916: 2:412).\nThough today adultery is certainly not treated so lightly, I believe\nthat there is more to Russell\u2019s report than the hyperbole of an out-\nraged Victorian sensibility. Amongst the new aristocracy of labour at\nleast, there has been a genuine shift in values.\nPolygynous marriages are increasingly at odds with these values,\nand even if a man may intend to supplement, rather than substitute,\na wife, wives are increasingly reluctant to tolerate the addition and\nincreasingly likely to leave\u2014which is possible because they can gen-\nerally support themselves by contract labour. What would in the past\nhave become a polygynous union is now more probably serial\nmonogamy.39\nA significant proportion of secondary marriages cross caste bound-\naries. For Girvi and Patripar I know of 116 intercaste marriages (and\nmore were doubtless concealed from me). Of these, nearly 90% are\nsecondary unions. Of all such marriages I estimate that 1:5 or 1:6\ncontravene the rule of endogamy. As a proportion of all current\ncouples, the number of intercaste unions is not dramatic\u2014about 7%.\nBut if I include wives, sisters and daughters who have run away with\na man of different caste and now reside elsewhere, we find that 10\u2013\n15% of all households in these neighbourhoods have present or previ-\nous members who have married outside their caste.40\n1994: 58\u20139, 68). A likely instance of the latter is given in the final section of this\npaper.\n39 Out of a total of 508 households in Girvi, 29 (5.7%) are currently polygynous.\n40 The distribution is of course uneven, and is significantly higher in some kinship\ngroups than others. For example, one genealogical fragment for the Girvi Tamrak-\nars\u2014who are amongst the highest status castes in the \u2018village\u2019\u2014shows 28 extant\ncouples. Of these, eight have intercaste unions. Two men of the lineage and six\nwomen took partners of different caste. Of the latter, two husbands were \u2018Biharis\u2019,\nthree were men of another \u2018Hindu\u2019 caste, and one was a Satnami (whose previously\nunmarried Tamrakar wife had moved in with him). It is significant that four of the\neight marriages (including the one with the Satnami) were between partners who\nwere both born in Girvi.\nBy comparison, Prakasam\u2019s survey (1993: 167) of Satnami marriages in a rural\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY804\nBut more significant than the figures is the form that these unions\ntake. My estimates exclude instances of marriage between two for-\nmerly endogamous units which now recognize the possibility of a\nprimary marriage between them\u2014as is the case, for example,\nbetween the Coppersmiths (Tamers\/Tamrakars) and Bronzesmiths\n(Kasers), and between various subcastes of Kurmi. Nor are we\ndealing with a pattern of women marrying \u2018up\u2019\u2014\u2018with the grain\u2019\u2014\nin the approved hypergamous manner sanctioned by the shastras.\nWhere both partners are Chhattisgarhis, they are often from widely\nseparated rungs of the hierarchy. The number of instances in which\nthe woman married \u2018against the grain\u2019 to a man of inferior status\nalmost exactly matches the number in which she married \u2018up\u2019. The\nconfusion of castes is further compounded by the fact that a signific-\nant proportion of these unions involve partners who were born and\nraised in the same ex-village neighbourhood. A woman who has\nbroken up with her first husband comes back to \u2018sit\u2019 in her maike,\nwhere she forms a liaison with a man who lives nearby. Though they\nmay not recognize each other as such, it is consequently difficult for\nthe in-laws to avoid all contact with each other or to pretend that\nthe union does not exist.\nOf these intercaste marriages, 38% (N = 43) are between partners\nwho are both Chhattisgarhis; 52% (N = 60) between a Chhattisgarhi\nand an outsider, and 10% (N = 13) between two outsiders.\nWhile, with regard to the first of these categories, the scale may\nbe new the occurrence is not. In the past the couple were boycotted,\nbut\u2014provided that the difference in status between the two castes\nwas not great\u2014they and their children would be eventually accepted\ninto the caste of the husband after appropriate penance. This charac-\nteristically took the form of a feast known as bharri bhat, at which any\nmember of the caste from the surrounding villages had a right to be\npresent and to demand the food of their choice. It was therefore\nfinancially crippling and in effect amounted to a caste admission fee\nthat enabled the wealthy to legitimate their irregular unions (cf.\nLeach 1961: 72). But as the rate of intercaste marriage rapidly grew\nvillage in neighbouring Raipur district found that less than three per cent (six out\nof 223 current unions) crossed caste boundaries (1993: 173, 167). Nearer Bhilai,\nHelen Carey\u2019s census of a multicaste village of 238 households revealed only one\nintercaste union, though there were at least eight other instances in which villagers\nhad married outside their caste and were now living in town. And that, of course,\nis one reason for the relatively high rate of intercaste marriage in places like Patri-\npar which serve as a sanctuary for villagers who have flouted the norms. I am\nextremely grateful to Helen Carey for making her census material available to me.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 805\nin the area around BSP, the caste councils tried to stem the tide by\ntaking a tougher line. One strategy was to admit the man and his\nchildren, but not his wife. Sometimes he was allowed to keep her as\nhis concubine (rakhel, lauthi rakhi). Sometimes he was required to\nrenounce her; and sometimes the children as well. Faced with more\nand more cases, however, some councils vainly tried for a time to\nimpose a permanent ban on a man who married outside.\nWith the exception of the Satnamis, such a ban always applied to\na woman who took a husband of different caste. While a woman\nmight acquire the caste of her husband, a man\u2014however super-\nior41\u2014could never join that of his wife (unless she were a Satnami).\nThe transmission of caste status is, in effect, patrilineal. Even if he\nhas married improperly, a son\u2014people say\u2014\u2018is a bit of our liver,\nisn\u2019t he? How can we cut him off and throw him away? But a girl is\na parai (an \u2018\u2018alien\u2019\u2019). If she does not do what we say . . . she will have\nto suffer the consequences\u2019.42 While the prodigal son \u2018has given his\nblood and semen and that is why his children are ours\u2019, such a girl\nis likened to a cracked earthenware pot\u2014the only thing to do is\nchuck it away. The consequence is that an increasing number of\npeople have maternal half-siblings and cousins of different caste to\ntheir own.\nThis reluctance to \u2018throw away\u2019 sons is one reason why the de facto\ntolerance of intercaste unions is rather wide. Another is that the\nsanctions against them are now rather weak. Goods and services are\neasily available in the town and there is now no question of the\nonce all-powerful malguzar of the village (its erstwhile landlord and\nrevenue collector) being able to order the Barber or Blacksmith to\nrefuse one work. Today, all a boycott really amounts to is exclusion\nfrom the life-cycle rituals of one\u2019s caste fellows. Even so, I know\ncases where a daughter\u2019s primary marriage was arranged with a BSP\ngroom whose family were boycotted. The caste panchayat may huff\nand puff, but can no longer blow down houses.43\n41 This plainly makes little sense in terms of conventional theories about caste\npurity, according to which there should be no problem with incorporating a man of\nsuperior status.\n42 Lar.ka hamara kaleja ka tukr.a hai na?

But a measure of the severity of\nthis boycott is that I was first told about it in an undertone by one of their young\nkinsmen as we sat drinking tea in their shop. True, another Weaver felt obliged to\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY806\nThe net result is that with regard to marriage the pattern of\nchange has partially replicated the re-ordering of commensal rela-\ntions. As the Hindu castes now publicly interdine, so they increas-\ningly intermarry. And in both spheres the Satnamis are excluded.\nBut the fact that marriages across this divide are never condoned\ndoes not mean they do not occur. Of the 43 intercaste unions from\nGirvi and Patripar in which both partners are Chhattisgarhis, seven\nwere between Satnami women and men of \u2018Hindu\u2019 caste and five\nbetween a Satnami man and a \u2018Hindu\u2019 woman.\nThe largest category of irregular unions, however, cross not only\ncaste boundaries but also those of regional ethnicity between Chhat-\ntisgarhis and outsiders (60 out of the 116 cases).44 All but five involve\na Chhattisgarhi woman and a man from outside. Of these latter an\nabsolute majority are \u2018Biharis\u2019.45 Chhattisgarhis put this down to\ndefects in the Bihari character, the violence of which explains the\nasymmetry. No sensible Chhattisgarhi exposes his throat by taking\none of their women. A less prejudicial assessment would include\ndemography and migration patterns. Before BSP, this area had an\nexcess population of women, and it was only in the vicinity of the\nsteel plant that this trend was reversed with the influx of migrant\nworkers in the 1960s (Verma 1972: 101). By contrast with the south\nIndian pattern of family migration to the industrial areas, that of the\n\u2018Biharis\u2019 is predominantly one of single men who only much later, if\nat all, bring their wives and children to join them (Holmstro\u00a8m 1984:\n68\u20139).\nNot uncommonly these Bihari husbands have a family back home,\nwhich is why colloquially their Chhattisgarhi wives are \u2018stepneys\u2019\u2014\n\u2018spare wheels\u2019. And as this suggests, there is sometimes something\nexploitative about these relationships\u2014as in the case of two Patripar\nshopkeepers (\u2018Biharis\u2019 both) who are alleged to have acquired Chhat-\ntisgarhi girls in settlement of debts. Moreover, Chhattisgarhi men\nhave a reputation for indolence; the women for industry.46 \u2018Here\u2019,\nresort to subterfuge to find girls for his boys. Their mother is a Thethvar-Buffalo-\nherder by caste, and when he applied for his and their acceptance as Weavers he\nincluded an affidavit from his wife affirming that their illicit union had ended. It\nhadn\u2019t and she openly played her role in the subsequent wedding rituals.\n44 In ten of the 13 cases of intercaste marriage between two outsiders, the part-\nners are also from different regions.\n45 29 out of 55 cases. \u2018Bihari\u2019 is also used for migrants from eastern UP.\n46 As Flueckiger (1989) notes, Chhattisgarh has one of the highest female labour\nparticipation rates in India. In an interesting analysis of the variations within a\nsingle oral epic tradition between two regions, she convincingly shows how (by con-\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 807\nsaid the Patripar Barber, \u2018women are the slaves of men. We sit at\nhome and they go out to work. But in UP-Bihar the men are the\nslaves of women and have to work for them. That is why they catch\nhold of our daughters.\u2019 But however this may be, many of these\nunions seem quite as stable as the general run of marriages.\nSex, Marriage and Industry\nAnd in a sense the Barber is right\u2014women\u2019s work outside the home\nis crucial. Chhattisgarhi women provide by far the greater part of\nthe casual unskilled female labour force employed on construction\nsites and in the steel plant, where they sort scrap, shift slag, clear\nup coal spillages and the like. They work in mixed gangs under a\nmale supervisor who is often an outsider, as is the mason for whom\nthey carry bricks. As I have described elsewhere (Parry 1999a), one\nreason why contract labour is preferred to work in the fields is that\nit holds out the promise of sexual adventure\u2014a significant propor-\ntion of illicit affairs and secondary unions being initiated in such\napparently unpromising settings as the BSP slag-dump. At the time\nof a strike there, a Malayali union leader told me, he had despaired\nto discover how many of his pickets by day were massaging the backs\nof blackleg Biharis by night.\nWithin the gang, the foreplay\u2014so to speak\u2014is legitimized by the\nsystem of fictive kinship into which all its members are incorporated.\nKashi, for example, classifies Kamla as his nani (maternal\ngrandmother) because Kamla is the name of his real grandmother.\nPhirantin is his bhabhi (eBW) because she comes from the same vil-\nlage as the wife of one of his classificatory brothers. Other links\nmight easily have been traced and his choice of terms is motivated.\nBoth of these relationships permit joking, and with one\u2019s bhabhi in\nparticular the joking is expected to take an explicitly sexual form\nand may even extend to horseplay. Kashi is fancy free, Phirantin is\npretty, the outcome predictable. And if Phirantin is married, her\nhusband\u2019s sense of humour is put to the test\u2014which is why most\ncouples avoid work on the same site. It is also why contractors are\nreluctant to employ them. Joking leads to jealousy, jealousy leads to\nrows and rows ruin schedules.\ntrast with its U.P. recension) the Chhattisgarhi variant foregrounds the themes of\nelopement, secondary marriage and female sexual initiative, which in turn reflects\nthe higher status and greater autonomy of women in this region.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY808\nHere, then, is one clue to the greater instability of marriage\namongst this segment of the working class. Legitimized flirtatious\njoking lets both sexes explore the possibilities of a more serious\nliaison. And if contract labour makes marriages, it also breaks them\nby putting temptation in the way, provoking jealousy and providing\nan unhappy young wife with a realistic means of doing without her\nhusband and a promising means of finding a new one. Not surpris-\ningly, BSP workers\u2014who can well afford the luxury of keeping their\nwives and daughters at home\u2014regard contract labour for their\nwomen as not only shameful but threatening. For their part, the\nwomen are probably happy enough to be relieved of what (despite\nits romantic possibilities) is such arduous, unpleasant and low-status\ntoil. For both sexes, then, female domesticity has certain advantages;\nwhile for relations between them it plainly has consequences. One,\nI suggest, is the greater longevity of marriage; and another is a signi-\nficant increment in women\u2019s dependence on men.\nA further clue to the contrast is BSP itself. In the politics of kin-\nship and marriage, the power of the state is regularly enlisted. Dis-\nputes between in-laws unrelated to dowry often escalate into police\ncases of dowry harassment. Consensual love affairs result in charges\nof rape at the instigation of rivals. Not that rape and dowry harass-\nment do not occur (though the latter is principally a non-\nChhattisgarhi problem). It is rather that many of the cases that get\nreported are not the ones that do. So routine is this recourse to the\npolice and the courts that it is perhaps surprising that legal divorce\nremains a rarity. There is not a single instance in Girvi or Patripar.\nIt is rather through the steel plant that the state most significantly\nimpinges on the regulation of marriage.\nIt does so in both direct and indirect ways. Indirectly, the most\nimportant impact is through BSP recruitment procedures (described\nin more detail in Parry 1999b and 2000). A BSP berth is the acme\nof almost all working class ambitions. With a view to obtaining one,\nmost young men who have managed to achieve the minimum educa-\ntional qualifications lodge their cards with the district employment\nexchange as soon as they are eligible. But the queue of qualified\ncandidates would stretch all the way from Raipur to Durg, and in\n1994 BSP was processing applications for the lowliest post of Plant\nAttendant from candidates who had registered in 1983. The result\nof the log-jam is that most aspirants will not know their fate much\nbefore they are thirty, and some (who are eligible for posts reserved\nfor the Scheduled Castes and Tribes) need not give up hope until\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 809\nthey have reached thirty-five. Because the quality of the match that\nhe can make\u2014in terms of the complexion and educational attain-\nments of the bride and the standing of her family\u2014critically depends\non their son\u2019s employment prospects, many fathers try to delay his\nmarriage until he is settled in a job. Moreover, a boy who can realist-\nically aspire to a BSP job wants an educated girl, while one who is\nactually taken on by the plant very soon learns from his non-\nChhattisgarhi work-mates that he ought to command a significant\ndowry. In short, while the divorce rate falls in response to BSP\nemployment, the age of marriage and the expectations of dowry rise.\nThe fall in the divorce rate notwithstanding, a young BSP worker\nwill not find it difficult to marry another virgin-bride if his first mar-\nriage ends, and\u2014unlike a low-status chhar.ve\u2014a higher rated kunvari\nwill come with a dowry. This at least partly explains what is, I am\nassured, a new phenomenon in Girvi and Patripar\u2014a group of youth-\nful \u2018abandoned women\u2019 from BSP families who have been \u2018sitting\u2019\ninterminably in their maike, because \u2018nobody (at least nobody of the\nright status) now comes to ask for them\u2019.47 Their plight is plainly a\nwarning to any daughter from the better-off segments of village soci-\nety who is contemplating the disappointments of her own marriage.\nIt also gives pause for thought to her father and brothers, who must\nnow face the prospect of having to provide for her and her children\non a semi-permanent basis if she leaves her husband. And they also\nof course run an enhanced risk of her bringing shame upon them\nby conceiving children in their house and out of wedlock. At least\nfor a woman and her family, these new barriers to remarriage in the\nupper echelons of the working class are an obvious disincentive to\ndivorce.\nDirectly, BSP intervenes in the regulation of marriage by invoking\nthe majesty of the law and the weight of the company rule book. By\nlaw, bigamy is a criminal offence punishable by a fine and up to\nseven years\u2019 rigorous imprisonment.48 By BSP rules, a worker who\nwishes to remarry must get permission from the company.49 Both\n47 In Girvi\u2019s Satnami Para (with a total of 79 households), I know of six such\ncases.\n48 The offence is compounded if the first marriage was concealed, and the term\nof imprisonment may extend to ten years (Diwan and Diwan 1997: 87).\n49 Until recently, such an application had to be accompanied by a certificate from\nthe local panchayat that that worker\u2019s previous marriage had been duly dissolved.\nSince these were frequently fraudulent, BSP now requires the courts ratify them\u2014\nwhich has dramatically cut applications if not remarriages.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P .

But it does have a Vigilance Department which the routine\nskirmishing of neighbourhood politics keeps supplied with anonym-\nous tip-offs, and which receives a regular flow of petitions from\ndeserted wives. These are forwarded for further investigation to the\nPersonnel Department in the worker\u2019s shop. Though only a small\nfraction of disciplinary cases are related to marriage,51 their demon-\nstration effect is significant. The standard strategy is to admit guilt\nand throw oneself on \u2018the kind mercy\u2019 of the enquiry in a letter\ndrafted by one of the clerks. At the hearing one humbly submits that\none is a poor illiterate fellow who has merely conformed to custom\nwithout knowing the company rules, and if possible claims that one\u2019s\nmotive in remarrying was to beget a son to perform one\u2019s funeral\nrites. This plays well to a management audience and the chances are\nthat you get off quite lightly.52\nBut some cases are less tractable. As the result of a complaint\nfrom his first wife who wanted maintenance, Bharat was charged\nwith having remarried without company permission. His version was\nthat it was his wife who had run out on him and their daughter,\nBudhvantin. At the time he was making a precarious living as an\n50 In fact, customary modes of divorce are recognized as valid by the Hindu Mar-\nriage Act, 1955 (Diwan and Diwan 1997: 601), and the courts have been reluctant\nto interfere with the jurisdiction of the panchayats (Derrett 1968: 363). Moreover,\na conviction for bigamy would seem to be extremely difficult to obtain. The courts\nhave been liable to construe secondary marriage as concubinage (ibid. p. 358);\nbigamy is only committed if it can be positively proved that both marriages were\nconducted with all the requisite ceremonies, and prosecution is impossible if the\nmarriage is declared void before it is started (Diwan and Diwan 1997: 86\u20137). Fur-\nther, section 198 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that a prosecution can\nonly take place where a complaint is lodged by an aggrieved party\u2014usually the first\nspouse, though complaints by certain other relatives may also be countenanced.\n51 Against workers in Battery Operations in the Coke Oven Department, there\nwere 102 disciplinary cases between January 1992 and October 1998. These\nincluded one case for bigamous marriage. Of the 65 current and pending cases in\nMarch 1999, again only one involved marriage.\n52 Typically, the disciplined worker would be required to repay any monetary\nbenefits he had illegitimately claimed and would suffer a temporary reduction in\nthe pay-scale.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 811\nitinerant hawker, could not look after the girl and had persuaded\nher now remarried mother\u2014whom he had met at a fair\u2014to take\nher. His luck then turned, he got a BSP job, remarried and now has\nthree other children. But in the meantime his previous wife had left\nher second husband, had got pregnant (by whom he could not say),\nand had given birth to a second girl. While he was willing to give\nBudhvantin a home, he was damned if he would support the mother\nand second child.\nThe wife of Ranjit, a Punjabi Sikh, complained that he had\nexchanged garlands with another bride in a local temple (photo\nenclosed), maintained two other women as his mistresses, and phys-\nically abused her in order to extort additional dowry payments from\nher parents. By dint of strategically-timed absenteeism, Ranjit span\nout the enquiry interminably, and was eventually sent a registered\nletter instructing him to report to the BSP Family Counselling\nCentre, Police Control Room, Sector 6.\nThe next instalment I heard on a subsequent visit when I spent\nsome days with Counselling. Not in the Police Control room, but in\nthe old administrative complex, down a dark corridor past an exhibi-\ntion centre with posters illustrating the comparative effects of alco-\nhol and yoga on the brain. From the Section\u2019s senior manager I\nlearned about stresso-graphs, the contribution of Sai Baba to coun-\nselling, and\u2014\u2018you won\u2019t mind it\u2019\u2014about the similarity of Chhattis-\ngarhis to Europeans in the matter of marriage. The solution is educa-\ntion and counselling; the objective is reconciliation through love and\nunderstanding.\nIn practice, however, these are sometimes supplemented by a cer-\ntain amount of well-motivated arm-twisting. Marital problems are\ntheir largest single category of cases53\u2014of which they have handled\nmore than 2,500 since the service was started in 1986.54 In the vast\nmajority, marital breakdown is accepted as a fait accompli and the\nissue is maintenance. In fact, BSP management has no legal standing\nin such matters\u2014only leverage. Though it is in nobody\u2019s interest\nthat the BSP \u2018bigamist\u2019 should be sent to jail\u2014least of all the jilted\nwife\u2019s since her husband would then be unable to support her55\u2014\n53 The runners-up are alcoholism and problems with delinquent children.\n54 The precise figure up to mid-August 1999 is 2520. Of these, 116 involved\ndowry harassment and \u2018strained conjugal relations\u2019 and 667 were applications for\nmaintenance brought by wives and sometimes parents. Of the 332 cases dealt with\nduring the last financial year (1998\u201399), 103 related to such issues.\n55 A criminal conviction automatically results in the termination of company\nemployment.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY812\nheavy hints about criminal cases and disciplinary proceedings gener-\nally ensure that love and understanding prevail. The worker signs an\ninstruction to the Salaries Section to pay a proportion of his wage\ninto an account set up for his wife.\nSometimes the complainant is transparently trying their luck\u2014like\nthe Girvi wife who had run off twenty years earlier and was now\npetitioning for a slice of her about-to-retire ex-husband\u2019s Provident\nFund.56 Sometimes the husband regrets his generosity. Until Coun-\nselling was given control of their credit to close the loophole, some\ntook loans so large from the company that the monthly repayments\nleft nothing for maintenance. Others\u2014like Ranjit\u2014find other ways\nof subverting the agreement. Counselling effected a \u2018reconciliation\u2019.\nHis wife agreed to go back to him, and he to make her a monthly\nallowance. But into the standard document Ranjit inserted an extra\nclause, which specified that he would only pay while she remained in\nhis house. He made that impossible, and she soon was back to say\nthat she would now go to court. In the majority of cases, however,\nthe agreements stick.\nIt is a remarkable phenomenon: a large-scale public sector enter-\nprise takes upon itself the task of defending the interests of the\ndeserted wives of its own employees, and thereby incurs the ire of\ntheir union. What motivates management?\nPart of the answer lies in the Nehruvian modernizing vision to\nwhich BSP owes its foundation, and according to which its purpose\nwas as much to forge a new kind of man in a new kind of society as\nto forge steel. And if these social engineers are middle-class high\ncaste managers from more \u2018civilized\u2019 regions, it is hardly surprising\nif the authentic expression of the family values of the modern Indian\nnation are their own more \u2018orthodox\u2019 norms. For them, I suspect, it\nis as much a matter of reforming the morals of men, who must be\nencouraged to become new model citizens, as it is of providing suc-\ncour to women and children. Their power to encourage stems of\ncourse from the fact that most BSP employees are very well aware\nof how privileged they are by comparison with other workers in the\narea, and are consequently reluctant to jeopardize their jobs.57 The\n56 Cf. Ramu 1997: 68 who reports past instances in the Kolgar Gold Field in\nwhich two wives showed up to claim a deceased\u2019s miner\u2019s Provident Fund, gratuity\nand benefits.\n57 In some ways the situation is reminiscent of Henry Ford\u2019s five dollar day, which\nprovided him with the basis for a quite tyrannical exercise of paternalistic authority\nover the lives and \u2018morals\u2019 of his workers (Beynon 1984: 34f; Miller 1992: 66f). I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 813\nreformist instincts of management are further reinforced by the fact\nthat regular BSP jobs have always been regarded as jobs for life.\nEven with the greatest missionary zeal, no employer has either the\nincentive or the capacity to exercise much influence over the private\nlives of labour which is here today and gone tomorrow. What is more,\na large proportion of the BSP workforce lives in the Company Town-\nship, and in the same Sectors as the managers. They should live\nthere respectably. Economic liberalization provides a further\u2014and\nequally significant\u2014ingredient in the form of a globalized market\ndiscipline, which increasingly constrains the Company to cut labour\ncosts by stamping on welfare scams. Thus paternalistic Nehruvian\nmodernism, Brahmanical values and \u2018bottom-line\u2019 accountancy com-\nbine to uphold the sanctity of marriage.\nBut just as important, I believe, is the way in which the work group\nmediates these new marital values. BSP work groups are socially very\nheterogeneous, being made up of both Chhattisgarhis and outsiders,\nand of high and low castes. In the \u2018hard\u2019 shops, where the work is\noften dangerous and involves close co-operation, but where there is\nplenty of time to socialize, they are also highly solidary\u2014which\nmakes them an important channel for the dissemination of the\n\u2018modern\u2019 and \u2018civilized\u2019 values of their most \u2018educated\u2019 members.58\nWhat that means in terms of marriage should already be clear,\nthough the paradox it entails requires a little elaboration. I have\nargued elsewhere (Parry 1999a) that the cohesiveness of the work\ngroup makes the BSP shopfloor a kind of melting pot which dissolves\nthe \u2018primordial\u2019 loyalties of caste, regional ethnicity and religious\nidentity. But the implication of what I am saying here is that there\nis a kind of undertow that pulls against this tide. The instability of\nmarriage is closely associated with the prevalence of intercaste\nunions. To the extent that BSP culture curbs that instability, it also\nreinforces the rule of endogamy and the separation of castes.\nBack in Patripar, however, caste as an institution is becoming\nincreasingly incoherent for increasing numbers of informal sector\ndo not wish to imply, however, that the BSP Counselling service has anything like\nsuch a sinister character as Ford\u2019s Sociology Department.\n58 I recognize that in principle one might postulate the opposite\u2014that the out-\nsiders acquire a more liberal outlook from their Chhattisgarhi work-mates. In prac-\ntice, I believe the influence goes predominantly in the direction I have specified.\nThis is because these values are increasingly regarded as superior by upwardly\nmobile Chhattisgarhis, and are associated with more powerful and prestigious\ngroups.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY814\nfamilies. It is true that, if castes perpetuate themselves patrilineally,\nthe problem of intercaste marriage is in principle limited since the\nprogeny are unambiguously assigned to the caste of their father. But\nlimited is not erased. Kinship remains bilateral, and more and more\nindividuals have close kin who belong to different castes. While in\nthe past there were powerful sanctions which would have precluded\nthe meaningful recognition of such kinship ties, that is no longer\ntrue. The separation of castes is subverted. Consider moreover the\ncase of the young Patripar man whose father is a Sindhi refugee,\nwhose mother is a local Satnami, and who has married a girl from\nthe neighbourhood with a Maharashtrian father and a Chhattisgarhi\nMahar mother. With grandparents of four different castes from\nthree different regions, it is not easy to imagine what sense caste\nwill make to their children. And though the numbers of such children\nis still limited, it is certainly growing.\nOn Intimacy and the Meaning of Marriage\nAt least for the labour aristocracy, marriage by contrast is chan-\nging\u2014rather than losing\u2014its meaning. Take Somvaru\u2019s family.59\nSomvaru himself is illiterate, started life as a carter and bullock\ntrader, became a forklift truck-driver in the steel plant and has been\nmarried five times. His first wife put him off, he claims, by chewing\ntobacco. The second ran away with a lover after a couple of childless\nyears, and the third was a witch. By the fourth he had four children;\nand when she died he took his present partner by whom he has three.\nBoth of the latter brought with them an infant daughter by a previ-\nous husband, whom Somvaru raised and got married.\nJanaki is his eldest child. Bright, ambitious and determined, she\ngot herself educated and is now a teacher in a BSP school, is married\nto the Vice-Principal of another and lives in a comfortable modern\nhouse in a middle-class housing colony on the edge of Girvi. Janaki\nwas fourteen when she married, and obviously put education to the\nsame use as Penelope put tapestry. No gauna until it was done. Her\nfirst husband was uneducated, unlovable and impatient. And mean-\nwhile Janaki had fallen for a senior student, her present husband.\n59 What follows is a much abbreviated version of a case history I develop in detail\nin a separate paper which is conceived as a companion piece to the present essay\n(Parry, forthcoming).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 815\nTongues wagged and Somvaru was forced to fix her gauna. Janaki\nabsconded, and only came home after her father had promised that\nhe would not send her until she had all the degrees she desired. Her\nfather-in-law then took Somvaru to court for depriving his son of a\nwife. And later, when Janaki had started to earn but was still an\nabsentee spouse, he again went to court to make her pay mainten-\nance to her unemployed husband.\nPramod\u2014now a god-like engineer\u2014is Janaki\u2019s husband\u2019s brother\u2019s\nson, but she brought him up. An eminently suitable boy. So suitable\nthat it proved extraordinarily difficult to find a Satnami girl who was\ngood enough. But when he was eventually married, his bride turned\nout to have a lover. Pramod filed divorce proceedings; the girl\u2019s\nfamily retaliated by registering a case of \u2018dowry torture\u2019. Divorce still\npending, the family decided that Pramod should remarry. The first\nwife\u2019s father got to hear of it and the police were tipped off that a\nbigamous marriage was about to be performed. But Janaki and her\nhusband were also tipped-off about the police tip-off, and the new\nwife\u2019s parents filed a case against the first wife\u2019s father for criminal\ndefamation.\nEnough said to signal the way in which the state and the law have\ncome to dominate the politics of marriage, and in which marriage\nhas increasingly become an arena for status competition within the\ncaste. More interesting is the shift in its meaning. For Somvaru, I\njudge it has little to do with intimate companionship, emotional\nempathy or shared tastes. It is above all an institutional arrangement\nfor the bearing and raising of children, and for the management of\nthe household economy. It is perhaps to be expected that Somvaru\nshould after so many years look back on his own previous marriages\nwith philosophical detachment. But the calm neutrality\u2014almost\nindifference\u2014with which many younger people from the bottom of\nthe working class heap also talk about marital break-up is striking.\nSomvaru has a favourite story\u2014of a relative who one day returned\nfrom his shift to find that his wife had left him and gone to live with\nhis closest friend. A couple of days later he came home to find that\nhis friend\u2019s wife had moved in with him. Nothing was ever said about\nit between the two men and they continued their friendship as\nthough nothing had happened. That, says Somvaru, is how one\nshould be in such matters\u2014\u2018cold-brained\u2019. One reason perhaps why\nthis exemplary tale is so close to his heart is that it has some reson-\nance with another, about which Somvaru himself is more reticent\u2014\nthough village gossip is not. He is reported to have had a long-\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P . PARRY816\nstanding liaison with a divorced\u2014but for him unmarriageable\u2014\naffinal relative. With equally \u2018cold-brained\u2019 phlegmatism, he after\nsome time arranged her marriage to a close friend and neighbour,\na childless man whose fourth wife she became. Their relationship\ncontinued, to the apparent satisfaction of both men\u2014until, that is,\nthe affair became a scandal. The lovers remained lovers, and the\nhusband acquired a longed-for son.\n\u2018Cold-brained\u2019 is not, however, remotely the way in which either\nJanaki or Pramod talk of their marital tribulations. For them the\nconjugal relationship clearly carries a much heavier emotional\nfreight, and the psychological costs of marital breakdown have\nincreased accordingly. No longer merely a matter of the satisfactory\ndischarge of marital duties, that relationship is now a bond between\ntwo intimate selves.\nIt is, I concede, likely that the desire for intimacy in marriage was\nalways to some extent present\u2014on the part of women especially. That\nat least is what is suggested by Kakar\u2019s discussion of the hankering\nwhich Delhi slum women express with their dream being \u2018a couple\u2019\n(jor.i) (1990: chapter 5); and by Raheja and Gold\u2019s analysis of the\noral traditions of rural women, which emphasize the ideal closeness\nof husband\u2013wife at the expense of inter-generational hierarchy\nwithin the household (1994: chapter 4). What seems to me new,\nhowever, is that what had formerly existed in a semi-submerged\nform, as an \u2018alternative discourse\u2019, has\u2014in the upper echelons of the\nindustrial working class\u2014now moved more centre stage, and been\nprogressively appropriated by men.\nProf. Giddens is right. There is a new ideological stress on the\ncouple and their relationship. In upwardly mobile BSP families in\nGirvi and Patripar, suicides triggered by frustrated romantic attach-\nments are now almost an epidemic.60 In Somvaru\u2019s old-style village\nhouse there is no separate space for the couple. Janaki and her hus-\nband have a private bedroom, dominated by what in village eyes is\nalmost a pornographic object\u2014a large double bed. When they are\nfinally assigned a Company quarter, a significant number of young\n60 A particularly tragic instance from a neighbourhood adjoining Patripar was\nrecently reported in the international press (The New York Times International, 24th\nApril, 2000). Four sisters, aged between 16 and 24, the daughters of a Hindu\u2013\nMuslim couple, had hanged themselves from the rafters of their hut\u2014in apparent\ndespair at their marriage prospects. It seems, however, that the problem was not\nan absolute want of offers, but the quality of those that had come. The eldest sister\nhad recently rejected two proposals of marriage.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nANKALU \u2019 S ERRANT WIFE 817\nBSP couples move out of these peri-urban neighbourhoods, and away\nfrom the husband\u2019s parents, to live in the Township. There they are\nforced on each other\u2019s society with a new intensity, and even if their\ndecision to move was not directly born of a desire for greater intim-\nacy, their changed circumstances are likely to encourage its\ndevelopment.\nI recently saw Subhash Ghai\u2019s Coca-Cola-sponsored blockbuster\nTaal at the Venkateshvar Talkies. \u2018Marriage\u2019, says the heroine\u2019s first\nlove, \u2018is not a contract or a festivity (utsav) . . . It is the mingling of\ntwo souls\u2019. And as he magnanimously renounces her, his rival reflects\nthat: \u2018an Indian girl does not become English by putting on English\nclothes. Her heart remains Indian and she can never leave her first\nlove\u2019. With the moist-eyed young steelworkers who filed out of the\ncinema with me this plainly struck a chord.\nI invoke it here because this pre-eminently globalized product\nseems to capture something which Giddens\u2019 trajectory does not. The\nnew ideological stress on the couple is accompanied, not by a new\nacknowledgement of the possibility of de-coupling, but by a new\nstress on the indissolubility of their relationship. Far from inspiring\nsexual emancipation, Coca-Cola and competition with Korean steel\non the global market, which makes BSP increasingly conscious of its\nwelfare costs, collude in promoting that message. And nor, of course,\ndoes the modern concern with the quality of the conjugal relation-\nship imply its greater equality. Withdrawn from the labour force,\nBSP wives pay a price in individual autonomy for the greater stability\nof their marriages. That stability, moreover, arguably represents for\nboth sexes (but particularly for women), a reduction in freedom of\nchoice\u2014not only about whether to stay married, but also about who\nto be married to. Despite the conventional sociological wisdom,61 a\nsignificant rise in the age of marriage has not been accompanied by\nany significant enhancement of the younger generation\u2019s \u2018right to\nchoose\u2019 their (primary) marriage partners. Though it is true that\n\u2018modern\u2019 fathers now seek their child\u2019s acquiescence (it can generally\nbe put no higher than that) to the spouse he has selected for them,\nit is in secondary marriages that individuals have \u2018traditionally\u2019 been\npermitted a more meaningful autonomy. But these are now increas-\ningly discountenanced.\nGiven all this, and given that with regard to divorce the most\nglobalized segment of Chhattisgarh\u2019s industrial working class has\n61 Associated above all with Goode (1963), and seemingly supported by the\nChinese evidence (Whyte and Parish 1984; Jankowiak 1993; Yan 1997).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nJONATHAN P .
