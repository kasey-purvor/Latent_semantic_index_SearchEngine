In the polar troposphere,\nbromine chemistry has been implicated as the major cause\nCorrespondence to: D. R. Worton\n(d.worton@uea.ac.uk)\nof surface polar ozone depletion (Barrie et al., 1988; Berg\net al., 1984; Cicerone et al., 1988) and bromine monoxide\n(BrO) as the major atmospheric oxidant driving mercury de-\nposition (Ariya et al., 2004; Ebinghaus et al., 2002; Lindberg\net al., 2002; Schroeder et al., 1998). The bromine result-\ning from the degradation of short lived bromocarbons has\nbeen implicated as a possible initiator for the autocatalytic\nactivation and recycling of inorganic halogens from sea salt\naerosols causing the observed \u201cbromine explosion\u201d events\n(Foster et al., 2001; Platt and Honninger, 2003; Sander et al.,\n2003; Vogt et al., 1999). It has been suggested that BrO may\nnot be constrained to polar regions but could be widespread\nthroughout the troposphere where it could influence the HOx\nand NOx cycles as well as providing a significant sink for\ndimethyl sulphide (von Glasow et al., 2004).\nIn the stratosphere, bromine can deplete ozone with higher\nefficiency than chlorine, \u223c45 times (Daniel et al., 1999), and\nthe dominant sources are understood to be from the photo-\nchemical degradation of methyl bromide (CH3Br) and the\nlong lived halon (bromofluorocarbon) compounds. How-\never, recently there is increasing evidence to suggest that\nother short lived bromocarbon species (CHBr3, CH2Br2,\nCH2BrCl, CHBr2Cl, CHBrCl2, C2H5Br and C2H4Br2) could\nbe important source gases of stratospheric bromine. Simul-\ntaneous observations of several of these bromocarbons and\nBrO in the upper troposphere have been reported (Pfeil-\nsticker et al., 2000), along with several aircraft (Schauffler\net al., 1999; Schauffler et al., 1998; Schauffler et al., 1993)\nand balloon (Kourtidis et al., 1996; Pfeilsticker et al., 2000;\nSturges et al., 2000) studies that have shown that these bro-\nmocarbons are present at concentrations in the part per tril-\nlion by volume (pptv) range and together are reported to\ncontribute \u223c10\u201315% to the total organic bromine measured\nin the upper troposphere lower stratosphere (UTLS) region\n(Pfeilsticker et al., 2000; Sturges et al., 2000). It has further\nbeen suggested that a fraction of the inorganic bromine orig-\ninating from the tropospheric breakdown of the same short\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2848 D. R.

CHCl3 is only estimated to\ncontribute \u223c2 Gg CHCl3\/yr or <10 pptv (Keene et al., 1999;\nMcCulloch, 2003) to stratospheric chlorine as a result of its\nshort tropospheric lifetime of 0.41 years (Ko et al., 2003)\nrelative to other more persistent chlorine containing source\ngases. CHCl3 is degraded in the troposphere, through oxi-\ndation by OH, to phosgene (COCl2) a small percentage of\nwhich reaches the stratosphere where it can participate in\nozone destruction (Kindler et al., 1995). Chlorine radicals\nderived from the atmospheric degradation of CHCl3 can re-\nact with other organic gases, e.g., hydrocarbons and alkyl\nnitrates, in the troposphere similar to the OH radical. This\ncan affect the tropospheric lifetimes of these species as well\nas influencing the local atmospheric composition, especially\nin the polar regions. In the case of hydrocarbons and alkyl ni-\ntrates the rates of reaction with chlorine radicals are greatly\nenhanced over those of OH oxidation (IUPAC, 2002; Muthu-\nramu et al., 1994 and references therein).\nThe global tropospheric bromine loading has been re-\nported to have peaked in 1998 and to have since declined by\napproximately 5% or \u223c0.8 ppt (Montzka et al., 2003). How-\never, this decrease is reportedly driven by the reduction in at-\nmospheric methyl bromide and the contributions of the very\nshort lived bromocarbons are considered to have remained\nconstant (Montzka et al., 2003) as they are generally assumed\nto be almost entirely of natural origin.\nRecently, Sturges et al. (2001) found no evidence for any\nsignificant temporal trends in the Southern Hemisphere con-\ncentrations of these bromocarbon gases. There are cur-\nrently no published Northern Hemisphere trends of bromi-\nnated trace gases as previous firn air studies of these species\nand CH3Br at Devon Island, Canada (Sturges et al., 2001)\nand CH3Br at Tunu, Greenland (Butler et al., 1999) resulted\nin the observation of anomalous profiles within the firn that\nwere interpreted as having been affected by post depositional\nprocesses.\nIn this work we present the first unperturbed firn profiles\nof four trihalomethanes (CHBr3, CHBr2Cl, CHBrCl2 and\nCHCl3) for the Northern Hemisphere from firn air collected\nat North GReenland Icecore Project (NGRIP), Greenland.\nThe anthropogenic contribution to the CHCl3 budget is as-\nsessed using a 2-D model and constrained using firn air mea-\nsurements from Arctic (NGRIP) and Antarctic (Dome Con-\ncordia and Dronning Maud Land) sites. The implications for\nthe budgets of the other THM\u2019s are also considered based on\nthe observed variations in the NGRIP firn air.\n2 Sampling and analysis\n2.1 Firn air measurements\nFirn air samples were collected at the North Greenland\nIcecore Project (NGRIP), Greenland (75\u25e6 N, 42\u25e6 W), De-\nvon Island (DI), Canada (75\u25e6 N, 82\u25e6 W), Dronning Maud\nLand (DML), Antarctica (77\u25e6 S, 10\u25e6 W) and Dome Concor-\ndia (Dome C), Antarctica (75\u25e6 S, 123\u25e6 E) sites. Details of\nthe NGRIP (Reeves et al., 2005) Devon Island, Dome C\nand DML sites (Sturges et al., 2001), sampling procedures\n(Schwander et al., 1993; Sturges et al., 2001) and analyti-\ncal methodologies (Fraser et al., 1999; Oram et al., 1995;\nSturges et al., 2001) have been given elsewhere.\nIn brief, aliquots of the firn air samples (\u223c400 ml) were\ncryogenically concentrated using liquid argon, then desorbed\nand separated on a DB-5 capillary column (J&W, 60 m) prior\nto detection by single ion mode mass spectrometry (Micro-\nmass Autospec) with detection limits of \u223c0.001 pptv. The\nassociated experimental uncertainties, as illustrated by the\nerror bars in subsequent figures, were determined as the to-\ntal analytical precision through duplicate analyses of samples\nat each depth and the measurement precision of the running\nstandard. CHCl3 measurements are presented from all four\nfirn sites whereas the brominated tri- and dihalomethanes are\nonly presented for the NGRIP site. The brominated species\nhave also been measured at the other three sites and were\nreported previously by Sturges et al. (2001).\n2.2 Firn modelling\nA firn physical transport model that accounts for gravita-\ntional fractionation and gaseous diffusion (Rommelaere et\nal., 1997) was employed to interpolate atmospheric trends\ninto firn concentration depth profiles. The required tortu-\nosity profile was determined by inverse modelling of the\nCO2 profile (Fabre et al., 2000). Diffusion coefficients of\nother molecules relative to CO2 were estimated from Le Bas\nmolecular volumes (Fuller et al., 1966). Thermal fractiona-\ntion effects were not included in the model.\n2.3 Atmospheric model\nTemporal trends in atmospheric concentrations for the loca-\ntions of the firn sites were generated using a 2-D atmospheric\nchemistry transport model. Details of the model are given in\nReeves (2003). The model contains 18 equal area latitudi-\nnal bands and 6 vertical layers, each of 2.5 km. The ocean\ncomponent of the 2-D model was removed as the lifetime of\nCHCl3 with respect to loss to the ocean has been reported to\nbe insignificant (Kindler et al., 1995; Yvon-Lewis and But-\nler, 2002) relative to the \u223c0.41 year lifetime resulting from\nthe reaction with OH (Ko et al., 2003). Other sink terms in-\ncluding dry deposition and loss to soils were also removed as\nthe reaction with OH was considered to be the dominant loss\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 6, 2847\u20132863, 2006 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/6\/2847\/2006\/\nD. R. Worton et al.: Trends and budgets of chloroform and related halomethanes from firn air 2849\nprocess (Keene et al., 1999; McCulloch, 2003). The strato-\nspheric lifetime of CHCl3 has been estimated at 3.18 years\n(Kindler et al., 1995) and this was used to determine the dif-\nfusive loss term out of the uppermost layer of the model.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Firn depth profiles\n3.1.1 CHCl3\nFigure 1 shows the CHCl3 measurements at four polar sites\n(NGRIP, DI, Dome C and DML) plotted versus CFC-12 in-\nstead of depth. This is in order to give an axis that is more\nlinear with time and that allows comparisons between differ-\nent sites (Sturges et al., 2001) because CFC-12 is long lived\nand has increased in both hemispheres at the same rate. The\nsamples collected in the convective zones (i.e., effectively\nsurface air) are not included in the comparison plots (above\n10 m for NGRIP and Dome C, and above 3 and 5 m for DI\nand DML, respectively). There is excellent agreement be-\ntween the two arctic sites (NGRIP and DI) and between the\ntwo Antarctic sites (DML and Dome C). Fig. 1 would suggest\nthat in the Northern Hemisphere the atmospheric concentra-\ntion of CHCl3 has increased by almost a factor of 2, from 7\nto 14 pptv, before declining in more recent times to around\n10 pptv. CHCl3 in the Southern Hemisphere would also ap-\npear to have increased but not to the same degree with an\nincrease of \u223c2 pptv. The maximum CHCl3 concentrations\noccur at the 66.99 m sample depth, which as will be shown\nlater (Sect. 3.2) corresponds to a date of \u223c1990.\nThe major sink for atmospheric chloroform is from the\nreaction with OH (Keene et al., 1999; McCulloch, 2003)\nand the global average concentration of these radicals has\nbeen reported to have increased by\u223c15\u00b122% between 1979\nand 1989 and to subsequently have decreased to levels in\n2000 that were\u223c10\u00b124% lower than those in 1979 (Prinn et\nal., 2001). These findings are disputed due to reported con-\ntinued emissions of methyl chloroform, used to determine\nthe OH trend, from Europe that call into question the magni-\ntude of the initial OH increase and the existence of a negative\ntrend during the 1990\u2019s (Krol et al., 2003). These variations\neven if they are correct are not only unlikely to be signifi-\ncant enough to explain the magnitude of the observed varia-\ntions but they are also in anti-phase to the observed changes\nin the CHCl3 concentrations such that variations from OH\ndriven changes in the atmospheric lifetime cannot be respon-\nsible. It is also unlikely that the observed variations recorded\nin the firn are due to changes in the natural fluxes from the\noceans and soils as a result of the relatively short timescales\ninvolved. Although, the perturbation of the natural source\nfluxes by anthropogenic activities cannot be discounted, e.g.,\nvariations in soil based emissions as a result of changing agri-\nFig. 1. Firn air measurements of CHCl3 versus CFC-12 at NGRIP\nand DI in the Arctic and DML and Dome C in the Antarctic.\ncultural practices or increased oceanic emissions resulting\nfrom human forced climatic changes.\n3.1.2 Bromocarbons\nFigure 2 shows the measured concentration depth profiles\nof CHBr3, CHBr2Cl, CHBrCl2, CH2BrCl and CH2Br2 de-\nrived from NGRIP firn air. The lines represent the firn model\noutputs corresponding to constant atmospheric burdens over\ntime (the scenarios in all cases begin in 1900). As a result of\ntheir OH and photolysis sinks (Ko et al., 2003) the concen-\ntrations in the shallow firn reflect the seasonal variations in\natmospheric concentrations (Kaspers et al., 2004; Sturges et\nal., 2001). Essentially, the summer firn drilling takes place\nwhen OH and photolysis levels are close to the peak annual\nvalues and as a result the concentrations of these halocarbons\nspecies are at a minimum. The gradients between the surface\nand 15m reflect the atmospheric concentrations from the pre-\nvious 6 months or so and as such show the variation between\nthe winter and summer concentrations. The scatter in the\nambient (0 m) measurements is the result of variations in the\nlocal meteorological conditions between sample collections.\nThe modelled lines shown in Fig. 2 incorporate seasonal\ncycles for CHBr3 and CHBr2Cl, based on measurements\nfrom Alert, Canada (Yokouchi et al., 1996) and for CH2Br2\nfrom measurements at Alert, Canada and Point Barrow,\nAlaska (Montzka, 2005). As no seasonality for CHBrCl2\nin the polar regions was available in the literature the same\nseasonality as for CHBr2Cl was assumed based on similar-\nities in their lifetimes, 77 and 69 days respectively, (Ko et\nal., 2003). Yokouchi et al. (1996) reported no seasonal varia-\ntion for CH2BrCl at Alert and the NGRIP firn measurements\nshow very little evidence for a seasonal cycle, most likely\nreflecting its longer atmospheric lifetime (Ko et al., 2003).\nIt appears from these firn profiles that the annual mean at-\nmospheric concentration of the CH2Br2 and CH2BrCl have\nbeen constant implying that non-natural sources are insignifi-\ncant, although for CH2BrCl the interpretation is complicated\nin the deepest firn by high concentrations that could be the\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/6\/2847\/2006\/ Atmos.

In contrast, it is evident\nthat an increase in the atmospheric concentrations of CHBr3,\nCHBr2Cl and CHBrCl2 are necessary in order to explain the\nobserved behaviour in the deepest firn. The similar nature of\nthe observed changes in the deepest firn would implicate a\nsimilar source driving the increases in the brominated THM\nconcentrations. The large magnitude change in the CHCl3\nconcentrations at NGRIP (Fig. 2) relative to the brominated\nTHM\u2019s implies a different source is likely to be responsible\nfor the observed variations in atmospheric CHCl3.\nFigure 3 shows the measurements of CHBr3, CHBr2Cl and\nCHBrCl2 versus CFC-12 at NGRIP. As a result of the season-\nally influenced concentrations the samples collected in the\nshallow firn (<30 m) are not included in this plot and the\nremaining data have been corrected for the effects of grav-\nitational settling, which causes heavy molecules to be en-\nriched at depth in the firn column relative to lighter ones.\nThe depth where the concentrations \u201clevel off\u201d can be dated\nat \u223c1992, based on the dates determined through the atmo-\nspheric CHCl3 modelling (Sect. 3.2). It is important to note\nthat the diffusion coefficients and hence the diffusion rates\nfor the various trace gases within the firn are distinct such\nthat the inferred age scale is only approximate.\n3.2 Atmospheric modelling\nThe global CHCl3 emissions were separated into 5 ma-\njor source terms; oceans, soils, pulp and paper (P+P), wa-\nter chlorination (WC) and other industrial processes (OI).\nBiomass burning is only considered to be a very minor com-\nponent, <2 Gg CHCl3\/yr or <1% of the total annual emis-\nsions (Lobert et al., 1999), relative to the other natural emis-\nsions and thus was not included.\n3.2.1 Natural emissions and distributions\nNatural emissions are reported to be significantly larger\nthan anthropogenic releases but are also far less constrained\n(Keene et al., 1999; McCulloch, 2003). The absolute val-\nues for both ocean and soil emissions are based on mea-\nsurements made by Khalil et al.

Hence, it follows that the quoted\nemission values are also likely to be overestimates by the\nsame factor such that the values used in this work are 180\u00b145\nAtmos. Chem.

(1999).\nAs a result of the significant reported uncertainties in the\nnatural emission magnitudes and a lack of information con-\ncerning the likely source distributions, the RCEI did not at-\ntempt to estimate the latitudinal distribution. Nevertheless as\npart of the RCEI\u2019s work (Khalil et al., 1999) the ocean and\nsoil emissions were constrained into 4 latitudinal bands; 0\u2013\n30\u25e6, 30\u201390\u25e6 for each hemisphere. In order to incorporate the\nnatural emissions into our model it was necessary to estimate\nthe distribution of the natural sources on a finer scale (i.e.,\n18 latitudinal boxes). This was achieved by assuming that\nthe flux rates per unit area within these bands are uniformly\ndistributed. The latitudinal distribution of natural emissions\nfrom this very simple approach, from now on referred to as\nND1, is shown in Fig. 4.\nA second approach was aimed at developing this first\napproximation into a more smoothed distribution. This\napproach involved determining emission factors for the\nocean and soils based on their fractional global coverage\nGross (1972), which was used in conjunction with the as-\nsumption that the tropical oceans (\u226430\u25e6) are more produc-\ntive than the sub tropics (>30\u25e6) and that this relationship was\nlinear with latitude, i.e., increasing linearly towards the equa-\ntor. This assumption is supported in essence by the greater\nemissions reported at lower latitudes by Khalil et al. (1999),\nalthough the linearity of the relationship is based on specula-\ntion only. For the soils, they were assumed to cover all areas\nthat were not classified as oceans (Gross, 1972) and the emis-\nsion factor was assumed to be independent of latitude and\nthus constant for the entire globe. This assumption is clearly\nlimited since there are large differences in soil and landscape\ntypes. Soil emissions from the most southerly box were set\nto zero since the only land mass <60\u25e6 S is Antarctica. How-\never, due to the resolution of the model, it was not possible\nto assume the same for the most northerly box because there\nFig. 4. The two estimated natural distributions (ND1= natural dis-\ntribution 1, ND2 = natural distribution 2 as defined in Sect. 3.2.1)\nused within this 2-D modelling work. The x-axis represents the lat-\nitude with positive values reflecting the Northern Hemisphere and\nnegative values the Southern Hemisphere.\nis not a permanent icesheet covering all land masses>60\u25e6 N.\nTo obtain a distribution that fitted within the constraints of\nall these parameters it was necessary to use individual nor-\nmalisation factors for both the oceans and the soils to correct\nthe calculated figures within each of the 4 larger semi hemi-\nspheric bands to match those reported by Khalil et al. (1999).\nAll of these applied normalisation factors were 1.0\u00b10.1 giv-\ning good confidence for the calculated figures and for com-\nparisons between the individual model boxes. It should be\nnoted that the applied soil emission factors >33\u25e6 S, i.e. in\nthe most southerly semi-hemisphere, are higher by a factor\nof \u223c2.6 than for all other latitudes. This appears to be nec-\nessary in order to match the estimated emissions of Khalil\net al. (1999) without requiring a large normalisation factor.\nSince land accounts for only 0.2 to 7.4% of the surface area\nin these boxes, this has a negligible effect on the overall bud-\nget. This distribution, from now referred to as ND2, is shown\nin Fig. 4.\n3.2.2 Anthropogenic distributions and trends\nIn the literature, the estimated anthropogenic source\nstrengths of CHCl3 are reportedly small (Aucott et al., 1999)\nrelative to the estimated natural emissions (Khalil et\nal., 1999). The associated uncertainties reported (Aucott et\nal., 1999; Khalil et al., 1999) with these estimates would\nsuggest that the anthropogenic source strength is better con-\nstrained and hence more well known although this work, as\nwill be shown, would suggest that this is unlikely to be cor-\nrect. As part of the RCEI work a global 1\u25e6\u00d71\u25e6 grided inven-\ntory of anthropogenic CHCl3 emissions was produced based\non 1990 estimates (Aucott et al., 1999). The 3 Gg CHCl3\/yr\nemissions resulting from combustion sources, landfills and\nruminants were not included in the grided inventory as they\nwere considered to be too small to make a significant im-\npact (Aucott et al., 1999). As emissions were given as mass\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/6\/2847\/2006\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 6, 2847\u20132863, 2006\n2852 D. R.

The reported global trend in paper production\/consumption during the 20th century and the interpolated trend used to construct a time\nhistory of the pulp and paper industry (FAOSTAT = food and agricultural organisation of the United Nations online statistics service).\nemission per square metre it was necessary to multiply by\nthe prescribed grid cell areas. These grid cell emissions were\naveraged into the latitudinal bands of the 2-D model to give\na latitudinally dependent source distribution. The grided in-\nventory suggests that \u223c93% of anthropogenic emissions are\nemitted in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIn 1990, 51% of the grided anthropogenic emissions\n(34 Gg CHCl3\/yr) were estimated to originate from the man-\nufacture of pulp and paper, 32% from the chlorination of\ndrinking waters and the chlorination of cooling waters used\nin power plants (21 Gg CHCl3\/yr) and 17% from other in-\ndustrial uses (11 Gg CHCl3\/yr) (Aucott et al., 1999).\n3.2.3 Anthropogenic trends\nBy assuming that all three anthropogenic source terms have\nidentical global distributions allows us to separate them and\nconsider their temporal evolutions independently. As there\nare not any long term trends which describe the evolution of\nthese source emissions it was necessary to use surrogates in\norder to extrapolate their values to the beginning of the 20th\ncentury.\nIn the case of the pulp and paper industry the surrogate\nchosen was the global trend in paper production and\/or con-\nsumption (Fig. 5) determined from a 3rd order polynomial\nfit to reported global figures for the period 1910\u20132002 (FAO-\nSTAT, 2004; Paperloop, 2004; Robins and Roberts, 1996),\nwith the greatest frequency of data occurring post 1960. The\nmore recent higher frequency datasets of the food and agri-\nculture organisation of the United Nations (FAOSTAT, 2004)\nand Paperloop (2004) are for paper production, whereas the\nlonger trend of Robins and Roberts (1996) is for paper con-\nsumption. There is good overlap between the three datasets,\nwhich suggests that the differences between production and\nconsumption are negligible in the interests of this approxi-\nmation. Now by assuming that in 1990 the amount of paper\nproduced released the reported emissions of CHCl3 facili-\ntates the determination of an emission factor (145 g CHCl3\n\/ ton of paper) that allows the extrapolation of CHCl3 emis-\nsions from the pulp and paper industry as a function of paper\nproduction. This emission factor lies within the range of pre-\nvious estimates (Aucott, 1997 and references therein) and as\nsuch is consistent with previous calculations. In 1990,\u223c95%\nof the global bleached chemical pulp used molecular chlorine\n(AET, 2001) and therefore the relationship between CHCl3\nemissions and paper production ought to be linear and in the\npursuit of simplicity was assumed as such.\nThis surrogate was used to determine only the pre-1990\ntrend for the P+P industry due to significant changes in\nthe industry during the 1990\u2019s (AET, 2001). The changing\ntrends within the global industry are illustrated in Fig. 6,\nwhich shows that the percentage of global bleached chem-\nical pulp production using elemental chlorine has decreased\nby slightly more than a factor of 5, from \u223c95% in 1990 to\n\u223c17% in 2002, and that the elemental chlorine free (ECF)\nand totally chlorine free (TCF) bleaching methods have both\nAtmos.

The changing trend in the bleaching methods; elemental\nchlorine, elemental chlorine free (ECF) and totally chlorine free\n(TCF), used in the pulp and paper industry during the 1990\u2019s (AET,\n2001).\nincreased over the same time frame, from 5% to 68% and\n0.2% to 6.5%, respectively (AET, 2001). These changing\ntrends are reflected, for the United States of America (USA)\nat least, by significant reductions (\u223c86%) in the air emis-\nsions of CHCl3 from the P+P industry (USEPA, 2004). This\ndeclining trend was well approximated (R2=0.98) by a 2nd\norder polynomial function, which was used in all further cal-\nculations. The decline in the USA\u2019s use of elemental chlo-\nrine in pulp production is shown (Fig. 7) to be well corre-\nlated (R2=+0.74) with the global decrease (AET, 2001). This\ncorrelation suggests that it is reasonable to assume that the\nobserved decrease in CHCl3 emissions from the USA P+P\nindustry (USEPA, 2004) also reflects what has been occur-\nring on a global scale. This is a reasonably quantitative as-\nsumption since the USA\u2019s P+P production has accounted for\n\u226530\u201360% of world production over the last 40 years (Paper-\nloop, 2004). These approximations were used to determine\nthe declining trend in CHCl3 emissions from the global P+P\nindustry for the period 1990\u20132002 and combined with the\nsurrogate trend based on paper production and consumption\nfigures to give an estimation of the 20th century emission\nhistory.\nThe global population was used as a surrogate for WC\nand OI processes and was based on the assumption that with\nan increasing population comes an increasing demand and\nuse of chlorinated drinking water and an increasing demand\nfor electricity and hence a likely increase in the amount of\ncooling water chlorinated for use in power stations. The in-\ncreasing global population is also likely to reflect the addi-\ntional demands of an industrialising society that are consid-\nered as part of the other industrial processes by the RCEI.\nThe global population has been used previously as a surro-\ngate for anthropogenic CHCl3 emissions (Trudinger et al.,\n2004) and this trend was determined from population figures\nabove the 1920 population, hence fixing a timeframe for zero\nemissions. The chlorination of water began at the turn of\nFig. 7. The relationship between the use of elemental chlorine dur-\ning the bleaching of paper pulp in the United States of America\n(USA) and the rest of the world.\nthe century and became widespread by 1920 (AWWA, 2004)\nsuggesting a reasonable approximation for zero emissions.\nThe global population trend was determined from data\npublished by the United Nations (UN, 2004) and the Popula-\ntion Reference Bureau (Ashford et al., 2004) with the higher\nfrequency data occurring post 1950. It was necessary to as-\nsume a linear growth rate between 1900 and 1950 due to lack\nof data. A surrogate global population trend was devised by\ncorrecting to population figures above that of 1920. Now by\nassuming that in 1990 the reported releases of CHCl3 for the\nwater chlorination and other industrial processes categories\nwere associated with the surrogate population at that time al-\nlows the determination of emission factors, 6.28 and 3.34 Gg\nCHCl3 \/ billion people for water chlorination and other in-\ndustrial processes, respectively. These emission factors allow\nthe determination of CHCl3 emissions from these industries\nas a function of the global population.\nThe temporal variations, over a 100 year period, for all\nsource terms, including a trend that incorporates a changing\nsoil source (Sect. 3.2.4), are shown in Fig. 8. A critical as-\nsumption is that the natural emissions from oceans and soils\nhave not changed over this time frame. We concede that in-\ncreased emissions from the biosphere could have taken place\nduring the 20th century, e.g., as a result of increasing global\ntemperatures. However, there is scant evidence to support\nsuch increases as a result of the apparent lack of increasing\ntrends in the THM and DHM measurements in the South-\nern Hemisphere (Sturges et al., 2001) and the DHMs in the\nNorthern Hemisphere (this work). The largest changes occur\nin the Northern Hemisphere and since it is hard to imagine\na natural source that only operates in one hemisphere a large\nvariation in the anthropogenic emissions needs to be invoked\nto describe the observations. An inherent assumption with\nthis approach is that the latitudinal distribution of all source\nterms has remained constant over time.\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/6\/2847\/2006\/ Atmos. Chem.

The time trends over the 20th century for all the natural and\nanthropogenic source components (1SS = changing soil source;\nP+P = pulp and paper; WC = water chlorination; OI = other in-\ndustries) incorporated in the modelling.\n3.2.4 Varying the soil source as function of population\nTo reconcile their modelling results, Trudinger et al. (2004)\nhypothesise that the soil source may have increased with time\nas a result of agricultural interference. This is supported\nby a recent report that suggests that the amount of land be-\ning cultivated has increased substantially in recent times and\nthat since 1940 the amount of land turned over to agriculture\nwas larger than in the two previous centuries combined (UN,\n2005). However, the notion that cultivated soil emits more\nCHCl3 than uncultivated soils is one of speculation and there\nis no supporting evidence for this at the current time.\nTo investigate Trudinger et al.\u2019s suggestion of an increas-\ning soil source, the soil emissions were fixed at 100 Gg\nCHCl3 for 1990 and extrapolated back to the beginning of\nthe century as a function of the global population in the same\nway as was performed for the WC and OI temporal varia-\ntions. This trend is referred to from now on as the chang-\ning soil source (1SS) and is shown in Fig. 8. The effect of\nconstant soil and changing soil emissions are discussed in\nSect. 3.2.5. It is apparent that a much smaller variation in\nthe natural emissions (e.g., soils) would be needed relative\nto any changes in the anthropogenic emissions to affect the\nsame magnitude change in the concentrations observed at the\nAntarctic sites, as a result of the northern mid latitude bias of\nthe anthropogenic distribution.\n3.2.5 Varying the magnitude of anthropogenic emissions\nThe reported (Aucott 1997) uncertainty levels associated\nwith each of the anthropogenic source terms suggest that the\nreported values (Aucott et al., 1999) could be up to a fac-\ntor of 2 larger. Therefore, all the anthropogenic emissions\nwere doubled, which resulted in a better approximation to\nthe NGRIP data (Fig. 9). The changing soil source (1SS)\nFig. 9. A comparison of the effect of varying the magnitude of all\nanthropogenic sources (x1 = reactive chlorine emissions inventory\n(RCEI) figures as reported by Aucott et al. (1999); x2=double the\nreported RCEI figures; x2+1SS = double the RCEI figures plus\nchanging soil source) with the NGRIP firn air measurements of\nCHCl3.\nscenario is also shown in Fig. 9 and the effects observed at\nNGRIP are reasonably small with slightly lower values being\nmodelled in the deeper part of the profile whilst the opposite\nis apparent for the near surface. The effect of this scenario\nis more significant for the Southern Hemisphere sites (not\nshown) where the higher values in the shallow firn and lower\nvalues in the deeper firn appear to improve the fit to the mea-\nsurements. However, these improved fits are more likely re-\nflecting the consequence of the distribution of soil coverage\nwithin the model as opposed to a definitive anthropogenic\nperturbation.\nIt is evident from Fig. 9 that the magnitude of the anthro-\npogenic emissions required to fully capture the maximum\nvalues observed in the NGRIP firn air measurements still\nneeds to be larger than double the reported values. The strong\ndeclining trend in atmospheric CHCl3 observed at NGRIP\ncoupled with the proposed source trends would suggest that\nonly by further increasing the emissions from the P+P indus-\ntry would it be possible to both model the maximum values\nobserved in the firn while still maintaining a good approxi-\nmation to the observed decline in the firn between 60 m and\nthe surface. Several runs were performed to evaluate the sen-\nsitivity of the model to increases in emissions from the P+P\nindustry. During these model runs the natural emissions were\nconstrained at a constant value of 280 Gg CHCl3 yr through-\nout. The magnitude of the WC and OI emissions were fixed\nat either the reported values (Aucott et al., 1999) or at double\nthese values dependent on the particular run. The P+P emis-\nsions were varied between 3\u20135 times the value reported by\nAucott et al. (1999).\nThe various model outputs are shown in Fig. 10 where\nit is clear that too effectively model the near surface\nAtmos. Chem.

P+P emis-\nsions between \u223c4\u20135 times the reported values would appear\nto be necessary to simulate the maximum CHCl3 concentra-\ntions observed in the firn with the bias being towards the up-\nper end of this range. We are not alone in believing that the\nanthropogenic emissions fluxes have been underestimated,\nTrudinger et al. (2004) also invoked an increase in emissions\nfrom anthropogenic sources to model their firn air measure-\nments although our magnitude is smaller by comparison. The\nconclusions regarding the magnitude of the anthropogenic\nemissions are based on the assumption that the magnitude of\nthe natural emissions are correct. It should be noted that al-\nthough the uncertainties in the natural source terms are fairly\nlarge, the fact that the concentrations observed at the bottom\nof the firn at NGRIP where natural emissions account for\n>90% of the total emissions coupled with the modelled con-\ncentrations for Dome C and DML together suggest that the\nemission magnitudes are reasonable. The values correspond-\ning to the model outputs corresponding to the increased an-\nthropogenic emissions are shown as latitudinal variations for\n1990 levels compared against the natural emissions in order\nto illustrate the importance of the anthropogenic contribution\nto the total budget. The largest contribution is in the North-\nern Hemisphere mid latitudes where this modelling would\nsuggest that the anthropogenic emissions strongly dominant\nover the natural emissions (Fig. 11).\n3.2.6 Latitudinal variation of peak anthropogenic emis-\nsions\nIn order to model the sensitivity of the location of the latitudi-\nnal maximum peak in the anthropogenic emissions the peak\nof the emissions was moved north and south while keeping\nFig. 11.

The x-axis repre-\nsents the latitude with positive values reflecting the Northern Hemi-\nsphere and negative values the Southern Hemisphere.\nthe total emissions constant. The result is four different lati-\ntudinal distributions shown in Fig. 12. The base case scenario\nused to test these latitudinal distributions was with constant\nnatural emissions, double the reported WC and OI emissions\n(Aucott et al., 1999) and four times the reported P+P emis-\nsions (Aucott et al., 1999). As might be expected the location\nof the maximum peak in the anthropogenic distribution has\nless effect on the modelled trends at sites that are far removed\nfrom the northern mid latitudes, i.e., DML and Dome C. At\nNGRIP (Fig. 13) the dependency is the largest and the con-\ncentrations vary by \u2264+7.6\/-7.1% between peak emissions in\nbox 2 and boxes 1 and 4, respectively. This approach also\nsimulates a difference in transport rates, e.g., moving the\nmaximum peak north simulates a more northerly bias in the\ntransport, and vice versa, that perhaps is not captured as a\nresult of the parameterisation of the transport scheme within\nthe 2-D model.\nIt is likely that the anthropogenic distribution used in this\nwork is reasonably accurate since, for the majority of the an-\nthropogenic emissions, the RCEI used the reported addresses\nof CHCl3 emitting facilities to create their grided inventory.\nThe largest uncertainty associated with the conversion of the\nRCEI grided inventory into the 2-D model is from the pulp\nand paper emissions from China and Russia. The location of\ntheir pulp and paper plants are not known accurately since\nthey are not listed in the International Phillips\u2019 1997 Pa-\nper Directory (Miller Freeman Information Services 1996),\nwhich was used by Aucott et al. (1999) to locate facilities\nin other parts of the world. Instead, the emissions for China\nand Russia were re-distributed based on population density\n(Aucott et al., 1999). In the case of China, this issue is com-\nplicated because its geographical location straddles two of\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/6\/2847\/2006\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 6, 2847\u20132863, 2006\n2856 D. R.

However, the effects are likely to be small\nas China and Russia are responsible for <10% and <5%,\nrespectively, of global pulp and paper production (Johnston,\n1996).\nThe closest fitting model trends are shown for NGRIP,\nDome C and DML in Fig. 14. There are four best fit trends\nthat correspond to slightly different emission scenarios, as\ndefined in the figure legends. The four scenarios shown\nincorporate either 4 or 5 times the reported P+P emissions\n(Aucott et al., 1999), double the reported WC and OI emis-\nsions (Aucott et al., 1999) and either natural emissions of\n280 Gg or 224 Gg (a reduction of 20%). The reduced nat-\nural emissions where introduced to improve the fits to the\nAntarctic firn air data and are well within the estimated un-\ncertainties reported by Khalil et al. (1999). The total anthro-\npogenic emissions associated with these four scenarios are\n190\u2013230 Gg at the peak in atmospheric CHCl3 around 1990.\nThese anthropogenic emissions are significantly larger than\nthe estimated 66 Gg CHCl3 reported by the RCEI (Aucott et\nal., 1999) and arise as a result of doubling the emissions from\nWC and OI and multiplying those from the P+P industry by\na factor of 4 or 5. These increases were necessary in order\nto capture the magnitude of the variation observed within the\nfirn air at NGRIP. Invoking more northerly transport would\nslightly reduce the estimated magnitude of these emissions.\nThis modelling strongly suggests that the reported anthro-\npogenic emission estimates are underestimated, especially\nfor the P+P industry. The incorporated values for the WC\nand OI industries are within the described uncertainties of\nbetween a factor of 2 and 5 reported by Aucott (1997). How-\nFig. 13.

This would suggest that the emis-\nsion factors determined by Aucott (1997) to extrapolate the\nglobal emissions from the P+P industry are likely to be un-\nderestimated and need to be re-evaluated.\nAt NGRIP, three of the four best fit trends model the\nmeasured maxima well. At Dome C and DML, the trends\nwhich incorporate natural emissions of 280 Gg over predict\nthe measurements although the general trend is well simu-\nlated (Fig. 14). However, reducing the natural emissions by\n20% to 224 Gg results in significant improvements in the\nmodel fits to the majority of the data except the shallow-\nest firn where concentrations are slightly under estimated\n(Fig. 14).\n3.2.7 Varying anthropogenic emissions\nThe contribution of anthropogenic sources to the total global\nCHCl3 emissions at the peak in 1990 was likely to have been\n\u223c41\u201350% (Table 1) and is strongly dependent on exactly\nwhich values are chosen for the natural and anthropogenic\nemissions. What is clear is that this value is significantly\nlarger than the \u223c10\u201312% previously reported by Khalil et\nal. (1999) and McCulloch (2003) and slightly lower than the\n\u223c60% estimated by Trudinger et al. (2004). This contribu-\ntion declines between 1990 and 2001 as a result of the re-\nduced emissions from the P+P industry but is still predicted\nto be \u223c25\u201329% in 2001 (Table 1).\nThe atmospheric lifetime for CHCl3 determined from\nthe model was 0.40.01 years, which is consistent with\nthat recently reported by Ko et al.

This would suggest that there\nare some limitations resulting from the global extrapolation\nof the rapid decline in CHCl3 emissions from the USA pulp\nand paper industry.\n3.3 Pulp and paper production versus water chlorination\nThe difference between CHCl3 and the other brominated\nTHM modelled trends (Sect. 3.1) would suggest that the ma-\njor cause of the observed variation in the CHCl3 concen-\ntrations at NGRIP does not result in significant brominated\nTHM production. During both the processing of pulp and\npaper and through water chlorination, the added chlorine\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/6\/2847\/2006\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 6, 2847\u20132863, 2006\n2858 D. R. Worton et al.: Trends and budgets of chloroform and related halomethanes from firn air\nFig. 15. The best fit modelled global and hemispheric (NH = North-\nern Hemisphere; SH = Southern Hemisphere) atmospheric evolu-\ntions of CHCl3 during the 20th century.\nreacts with organic material through classic haloform reac-\ntions (Ballschmiter, 2003) to form principally CHCl3, but in\nthe presence of bromide the other brominated THM are also\nobserved to be produced (Cooper et al., 1985; Rook, 1974;\nRook et al., 1978). The major differences between these two\nindustrial processes are the availability of bromide, which\nhas been shown to directly effect the speciation of THM by-\nproducts (Cooper et al., 1985; Richardson et al., 2003; Rook,\n1974; Rook et al., 1978) and the amount of organic material\nthat is present in the reaction system. It is possible to make\nan estimation of the available pools of organic bromine that\nare present during pulp and paper production and water chlo-\nrination processes. The total water chlorinated globally has\nbeen estimated to be \u223c3.8\u00d71015 litres\/yr of which \u223c40%\nwas inland source water, i.e., river water, and the remain-\nder was coastal in origin, i.e., seawater (Quack and Wallace,\n2003 and references therein). The reported concentrations of\nbromide in non-seawaters are shown in Table 2, which give\na range of upper limit values for the potential formation of\nbrominated organics assuming that all the bromide present\nreacts with the organic material. An estimate of the average\nchloride content in surface and ground waters is also shown\nin Table 2 for comparison. The concentration of bromide\nin average composition seawater has been estimated to be\n67.4 mg\/l (Libes, 1992). Using these figures the total organic\nbromine that could result from the chlorination of drinking\nand cooling waters is \u223c1.5\u00d71014 grams\/yr dependent on the\nconcentration of bromide in the inland source water. In 1990,\naround the time of the observed maximum peak in recon-\nstructed atmospheric CHCl3, it has been estimated that, glob-\nally, 6.27\u00d71010 kg of bleached chemical pulp was produced\nthrough the use of elemental chlorine (AET, 2001). The av-\nerage bromide content of a variety of tropical and temperate\nwoods are shown in Table 3. An estimate of the average chlo-\nride content in tropical and temperate woods is also shown in\nTable 3 for comparison. Using these figures the total organic\nbromine that could result from the production of pulp and\nTable 3.

These are only approximate figures and assume that\nall available bromide reacts with the available organic mat-\nter. However, they suggest that water chlorination has a much\nlarger pool (6\u20138 orders of magnitude) of bromide and hence\na greater potential to produce brominated organics, such as\nthe brominated THM\u2019s, relative to the production of pulp and\npaper.\nThe much lower availability of bromine during the pro-\ncessing of pulp and paper relative to water chlorination\nwould imply that THM by-production from this process is\nsignificantly biased towards CHCl3 formation. The differ-\nence in available bromide provides an explanation for the ob-\nserved differences in the firn air measurements at NGRIP be-\ntween CHCl3 and the other brominated THM species, which\nare most likely formed as by-products in water chlorina-\ntion. Following the higher bromide concentrations in seawa-\nter it is also logical to conclude that when the source water\nto be chlorinated is marine derived the speciation of THM\nare likely to be more biased towards the bromine containing\nspecies. This suggestion is supported by larger estimates of\nCHBr3 production from coastal power plants relative to in-\nland ones (Quack and Wallace, 2003) and with observations\nof high concentrations of CHBr2Cl, CHBrCl2 and CHBr3\naround seawater cooled power plants (Allonier et al., 1999;\nJenner et al., 1997).\n3.4 Implications for the THM budgets\nFigs. 2 and 3 suggest that during the 20th century the atmo-\nspheric burdens of the brominated THM have increased. As\nhas been described for CHCl3 (Sect. 3.1.1) the reported vari-\nations in OH cannot account for the observed concentration\nvariations in the firn. It also seems unlikely that natural varia-\ntions in solar radiation would have declined significantly over\nthe last 50 years or so to account for the increases in these\nspecies considering the timescale involved.\nAs part of work reported by the WMO in the 2002 report\nthe atmospheric removal rates were estimated for the bromi-\nnated THM\u2019s (Table 4) by dividing the global average burden\nby the global average lifetime (Ko et al., 2003). The global\naverage burden was determined by deriving an expression\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 6, 2847\u20132863, 2006 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/6\/2847\/2006\/\nD. R. Worton et al.: Trends and budgets of chloroform and related halomethanes from firn air 2859\nTable 4. Estimated lifetimes, removal rates\/emission fluxes and associated uncertainties for the three brominated THM in the Northern\nHemisphere only (Adapted from Ko et al. 2003).\nSpecies Lifetime Estimated Removal Uncertainty in Estimated\n(years) Rate\/Emission Flux Removal Rate\/Emission\nAverage, [Range] (Gg Br yr\u22121) Flux(%)\nCHBr3 0.07 100, [75\u2013125] 55\nCHBr2Cl 0.19 4.1, [2.1\u20136.0] 66\nCHBrCl2 0.21 3.3, [3.1\u20133.5] 35\nbased on the median boundary layer mixing ratios measured\nduring the TRACE-P, PEM tropics A and B campaigns cou-\npled with the estimated altitudinal profiles (Ko et al., 2003).\nThis expression assumed that removal in the stratosphere\nwas negligible and that the atmospheric lifetime was uniform\nthroughout the troposphere. In order to estimate the emission\nfluxes in the Northern Hemisphere only, the species were as-\nsumed to be in steady state such that the annual emission\nflux was equivalent to the annual removal rate and that value\nwas halved. The uncertainty, shown in Table 4, reflects both\nthe range in the estimated removal rates resulting from the\ndifferent median mixing ratios and the ranges in these mix-\ning ratios used to determine the atmospheric burdens (Ko et\nal., 2003). It does not include any uncertainty in the average\nglobal atmospheric lifetime.\nIt was possible to estimate the increase in fluxes for the\nthree brominated THM\u2019s as a function of the observed in-\ncreases from the NGRIP firn air measurements. This as-\nsumes that the concentrations at NGRIP are representative\nof the Northern Hemisphere such that the observed increases\nin the firn can be directly related to corresponding increases\nin the annual northern hemispheric fluxes. Between the firn\nclose off depth and the depth (\u223c60 m) where the concen-\ntrations are observed to \u201clevel off\u201d the concentrations of\nCHBr3, CHBr2Cl and CHBrCl2 are observed to increase\nby 16\u201324% (Table 5), which would suggest similar percent-\nage increases in the annual fluxes reflecting the contribution\nfrom anthropogenic sources (Table 5). This depth interval in\nthe NGRIP firn represents approximately 40 years of history\n(\u223c1950\u20131990) according to dating based on the modelled\nand measured atmospheric evolution of CFC-12 (Sturges et\nal., 2001). The estimated uncertainty, shown in Table 5, re-\nflects the combined errors from determining the observed in-\ncreases in the firn between the close off depth and 60 m and\nthe errors associated with the estimated removal rates.\nCHBr3 has been reported to contribute \u223c95% (Allonier et\nal., 1999; Jenner et al., 1997) to the total THM\u2019s measured in\ncoastal power plant effluent such that this is reported to be the\ndominant source of anthropogenic CHBr3 (Quack and Wal-\nlace, 2003). As a result the contribution of the other bromi-\nnated THM\u2019s (CHBr2Cl and CHBrCl2) are much smaller\nand this difference may account for the much smaller esti-\nmated fluxes of these species relative to CHBr3 (Table 5).\nTable 5. Average observed Northern Hemisphere increases in the\nbrominated THM\u2019s from NGRIP firn air measurements, the associ-\nated uncertainties and the estimated anthropogenic fluxes based on\nthe observed increases.\nSpecies Average Observed Estimated\nIncrease (%) Anthropogenic\nFlux (Gg Br yr\u22121)\nCHBr3 16\u00b16 16\u00b18.9\nCHBr2Cl 16\u00b15 0.66\u00b10.43\nCHBrCl2 24\u00b15 0.79\u00b10.28\nThis is in agreement with the observations of CHBr2Cl and\nCHBrCl2 being present at concentrations approximately 4\u2013\n7% of CHBr3 in a variety of coastal power plant effluents\n(Allonier et al., 1999; Jenner et al., 1997). Interestingly, the\nestimated fluxes of CHBr2Cl and CHBrCl2 (Table 5) are 4\u2013\n5% of the CHBr3 flux, which would support the source of\nthese species being the result of seawater chlorination.\nThe total global emission of bromoform from both\nfresh and sea water chlorination has been estimated to be\n\u223c28 Gg Br yr\u22121 (Quack and Wallace, 2003) with the ma-\njority (\u223c90%) being from sea water chlorination used in\ncoastal power stations. Estimates of the hemispheric distri-\nbution of electricity production (WRI, 2004) would suggest\nthat >90% of these emissions (\u223c25 Gg Br yr\u22121) are likely\nto be located in the Northern Hemisphere, which consider-\ning the associated uncertainties results in good agreement to\nthe 16\u00b18.9 Gg Br yr\u22121 estimated from this work (Table 5).\nHowever, it is important to note that our estimates are likely\nto be upper limits and as such our study points towards\nemissions that are lower than those reported by Quack and\nWallace (2003). Gschwend et al. (1985) reported the to-\ntal organobromines estimated to result from water chlorina-\ntion to be 4.6 Gg Br yr\u22121, which was considerably lower es-\npecially considering that it also includes emissions of other\nbromine containing gases. The most significant difference\nbetween the estimates of Quack and Wallace (2003) and\nGschwend et al. (1985) is that Quack and Wallace (2003)\nreport that the chlorination of seawater is by far the larger\nsource of CHBr3 (\u223c90%) whereas Gschwend et al. (1985)\nestimated that freshwater chlorination produces an order of\nmagnitude more organobromines than seawater chlorination.\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/6\/2847\/2006\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 6, 2847\u20132863, 2006\n2860 D. R. Worton et al.: Trends and budgets of chloroform and related halomethanes from firn air\nOur results show that, in the case of bromoform at least,\nseawater chlorination far outweighs freshwater as an anthro-\npogenic source of bromoform, and the small apparent atmo-\nspheric fluxes of the bromochloromethanes, which are be-\nlieved to exceed emissions of bromoform in freshwater chlo-\nrination (Lepine and Archambault, 1992), also argues against\na significant impact of freshwater chlorination on observed\natmospheric THM concentrations.\nIt should be stressed that our estimated anthropogenic\nfluxes in Table 5 are likely to be upper limits and that these\nfluxes have been calculated using hemispheric average life-\ntimes. The emissions are likely to be mostly at mid-latitudes\nwith transport pathways to the Arctic firn sampling sites be-\ning predominantly towards the north (Kahl et al., 1997). The\nrelevant lifetime may, therefore, be longer than the hemi-\nspheric average lifetime. Furthermore, the observed rise in\nconcentrations may be more representative of mid to high\nlatitudes, particularly in the case of bromoform which is suf-\nficiently short-lived to not be well mixed in the Northern\nHemisphere. Interestingly, the absolute magnitude of CHBr3\nand CHBr2Cl concentrations at NGRIP are reasonably com-\nparable to the concentrations detected during the TRACE-\nP and the PEM tropics A and B campaigns (Blake et al.,\n2001; Blake et al., 2003; Blake et al., 1999a; Blake et al.,\n1999b) that were used to determine the global burden (Ko et\nal., 2003).\nThe estimated anthropogenic fluxes for the brominated\nTHM\u2019s suggest, assuming they are entirely the result of sea-\nwater chlorination, that seawater chlorination is a significant\natmospheric source of these species accounting for \u223c10% of\nthe estimated global fluxes (Ko et al., 2003). However, these\nanthropogenic fluxes are less significant when compared to\nthe estimated natural flux of \u223c800 Gg Br yr\u22121 reported by\nQuack and Wallace (2003). Since there appears to be a mea-\nsurable rise in concentrations at NGRIP this suggests that if\nthe global flux were to be much larger than that estimated in\nthe WMO 2002 report, then the estimated anthropogenic flux\nmight also be proportionately larger. Conversely, if much of\nthe global flux were located in the tropics then it might be, as\na result of the shorter lifetime of CHBr3 within the tropics,\nthat the observations at NGRIP are relatively insensitive to\nthe magnitude of such a flux.\n4 Summary\nThis work has presented polar firn air data for CHCl3 from\nboth hemispheres that show excellent agreement between\nsites in the same hemisphere. We also presented evidence\nfor changes in the CHCl3 burden over the last century, with\nthe greatest variations occurring in the Northern Hemisphere.\nWith the aid of 2-D atmospheric chemistry model we have\nshown that the contribution of anthropogenic emissions to\nthe total global CHCl3 budget was previously been under-\nestimated and was likely to have been as high as \u223c50% at\nthe maximum peak in atmospheric CHCl3 concentrations in\n1990. The 2-D model results indicate that anthropogenic\nsources dominate over natural emissions>20\u25e6 N and suggest\nthat the global CHCl3 concentration has doubled over the\nlast century. From NGRIP firn air we have shown measure-\nments of 5 brominated species (CHBr3, CHBr2Cl, CHBrCl2,\nCH2Br2 and CH2BrCl) and with the aid of firn diffusion\nmodel have shown that while CH2Br2 is entirely of nat-\nural origin the brominated THM\u2019s show evidence for in-\ncreases in their atmospheric burdens over the 20th century.\nThese increases are suggested to be predominantly the re-\nsult of the chlorination of seawater used as cooling water in\ncoastal power stations and we estimate this source to con-\ntribute \u223c10% to the global budgets.\nAcknowledgements.
