Many of these proteins are synthesised by the male accessory glands and are secreted into the accessory gland lumen, where they are stored until required. Previous studies on the identification of Drosophila accessory gland products have largely focused on characterisation of male-specific accessory gland cDNAs from D. melanogaster and, more recently, Drosophila simulans. In the present study, we have used a proteomics approach without any sex bias to identify proteins in D. melanogaster accessory gland secretions. Results Thirteen secreted accessory gland proteins, including seven new accessory gland proteins, were identified by 2D-gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments. They included protein-folding and stress-response proteins, a hormone, a lipase, a serpin, a cysteine-rich protein and two peptidases, a pro-enzyme form of a cathepsin K-like cysteine peptidase and a \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase. Enzymatic studies established that accessory gland secretions contain a cysteine peptidase zymogen that can be activated at low pH. This peptidase may have a role in the processing of female and other male-derived proteins, but is unlikely to be involved in the processing of the sex peptide. \u03b3-Glutamyl transpeptidases are type II integral membrane proteins; however, the identified AG \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT-1) is unusual in that it is predicted to be a soluble secreted protein, a prediction that is supported by biochemical evidence. GGT-1 is possibly involved in maintaining a protective redox environment for sperm. The strong \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase activity found in the secretions provides an explanation for the observation that glutamic acid is the most abundant free amino acid in accessory gland secretions of D. melanogaster.

Previous studies on the identification of Drosophila accessory gland products have largely focused on characterisation of male-specific accessory gland cDNAs from D. melanogaster and, more recently, Drosophila simulans. In the present study, we have used a proteomics approach without any sex bias to identify proteins in D. melanogaster accessory gland secretions. Results Thirteen secreted accessory gland proteins, including seven new accessory gland proteins, were identified by 2D-gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments. They included protein-folding and stress-response proteins, a hormone, a lipase, a serpin, a cysteine-rich protein and two peptidases, a pro-enzyme form of a cathepsin K-like cysteine peptidase and a \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase.

They are\nresponsible for the synthesis and secretion of a large\nnumber of seminal fluid proteins, many of which have\nnot been structurally or functionally characterised. The\nmost studied AG products are male-specific proteins\n(Acps) that elicit multiple physiological and behavioural\neffects in post-mated females [3]. These male influences\ninclude increased rate of egg-laying, reduced attractiveness\nto males, rejection of courting males, better sperm storage\nand a reduction in female life-span [3]. The altered behav-\niour of mated females can last up to one week and this\nlong-term effect is dependent upon transfer of both sperm\nas well as seminal fluid. The sex peptide (Acp70A) is partly\nresponsible for eliciting the short-term female responses\nand solely responsible for the longer lasting changes in\npost-mated female behaviour [4,5]. The latter effect is\ndependent upon the presence of sperm that carry sex pep-\ntide bound to the surface of sperm tails [6]. The tethered\nsex peptide is slowly-released from the sperm by proteo-\nlytic cleavage of the N-terminal binding domain from the\nC-terminal sequence, which contains the signal for the\npost-mating response [7]. A second AG product (ovulin,\nACP26Aa) is also involved in stimulating the early\nresponses in mated females and appears to have a direct\neffect on ovulation [8-10]. Ovulin also undergoes proteol-\nysis in the female reproductive tract to release biologically\nactive peptides, a process that is dependent upon another,\nas yet unidentified, male AG product [11]. Sperm storage\nin the post-mated female requires Acp36DE, a 122 kDa\nglycoprotein that is processed to a 68 kDa protein in the\nfemale within ten minutes of transfer from the male [12-\n14].\nOther seminal fluid proteins that have been studied\ninclude peptidase inhibitors, components of the mating\nplug, lipases and anti-bacterial peptides (reviewed in [3]).\nAn expressed sequence tag screen of a cDNA library pre-\npared from the AGs of D. simulans and purposely enriched\nfor male-specific cDNAs, indicated that there might be in\ntotal over 70 Acps in this species [15]. Several classes of\nenzymes, including lipases and peptidases, were well rep-\nresented in the D. simulans AG ESTs, as were peptidase\ninhibitors and immune defence proteins [16]. This infor-\nmation has led to a re-assessment of the total number of\nsecreted D. melanogaster Acps, which is now thought to be\n52 [17]. However, this number will exclude AG products,\nwhich are highly expressed in female tissues, but are vital\nfor male reproductive success. Specific antibodies raised\nto thirteen D. melanogaster Acps showed that these male\nAG proteins have multiple fates once transferred to the\nfemale reproductive tract, with some proteins entering the\nfemale haemolymph [18].\nWe now report the direct characterisation of protein prod-\nucts of D. melanogaster AGs, which were resolved by 2D-\ngel electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry of\ntryptic peptides. This study identifies thirteen AG proteins,\nincluding protein-folding and stress-response proteins, a\nlipase, a cysteine-rich protein and two peptidases, a pro-\nform of a cathepsin-like cysteine peptidase and a soluble\n\u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase. Seven of these proteins have\nnot previously been identified as secreted AG products.\nWe also show that the AG secretions possess cysteine\npeptidase and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase activities and\nthat the cysteine peptidase is synthesised primarily as an\ninactive zymogen. The cathepsin K-like cysteine peptidase\nis a candidate for the processing enzyme responsible for\nthe delayed cleavage of male proteins and peptides in the\nuterus of the post-mated female.\nResults and discussion\nIdentification of secreted AG proteins\nAG contents were analysed by 2D-gel electrophoresis; the\nfirst dimension used either pH 3\u201310 or pH 4\u20137 IPG strips\n(Fig. 1). The gels were Coomassie stained and the most\nintense resolved protein spots subjected to trypsin diges-\ntion and peptide fragment analysis by either MALDI-MS\nor LC-MS\/MS. Thirteen AG proteins with predicted signal\npeptides for secretion were identified using this method\nand their functions were inferred from comparison of the\nprimary structure to members of protein families with\nknown biological activity (Table 1). Almost half of these\nproteins could be classed as stress response proteins or as\nproteins required for the efficient and correct folding of\nnewly synthesised proteins in the ER lumen. The other\ngroup of proteins contains two peptidases, a lipase, a pro-\ntein hormone (Acp36DE), a cysteine-rich protein and a\nserpin.\nProtein folding and stress response proteins\nCG2852 (cyclophilin-like) and CG9847 (Fkbp-13) are\npeptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases that catalyse the cis-\ntrans isomerisation of peptidyl-prolyl bonds in polypep-\ntide chains. They belong to two different structural classes\nthat are phylogenetically conserved and are known to\nhave multiple roles in the folding, assembly and traffick-\ning of cellular proteins [19]. Although considered to be\nprimarily intracellular proteins, some mammalian cells\nsecrete cyclophilins into the extracellular environment,\nwhere they have an important role in mediating cellular\nresponses to oxidative stress and in modulating immu-\nnity. CG6988 is a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) that\ncontains two thioredoxin-like folds and is highly\nexpressed at all stages of development [20]. The PDI fam-\nily of proteins catalyse the formation, reduction and isom-\nerisation of disulphide bonds and can protect cells from\nhypoxic cell death [21]. Their ability to bind polypeptide\nchains allows PDI to act as a molecular chaperone assist-Page 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nProteome Science 2006, 4:9 http:\/\/www.proteomesci.com\/content\/4\/1\/9ing with the folding of polypeptides and increasing the\nyield of correctly folded proteins.\nFour other molecular chaperones (CG9429\/calreticulin;\nCG4147\/HSP70-3; CG2918; CG5520\/Gp93) were identi-\nfied in this proteomic study of male AGs. D. melanogaster\ncalreticulin belongs to the highly conserved family of lec-\ntin-like Ca2+-binding ER proteins that have diverse cellu-\nlar roles in mammals, including regulation of intracellular\nCa2+, the correct folding of glycoproteins, integrin-medi-\nated Ca2+ signalling, phagocytosis and cell adhesion\n[22,23]. HSP70-3 is a BiP homologue involved in assem-\nbling protein complexes inside the endoplasmic reticu-\nlum [24]. Gp93 is a highly conserved heat shock protein\n(HSP) of the vertebrate gp96 family of endoplasmic retic-\nulum proteins. Galewsky et al. have reported that Gp93\naccumulates at cell borders suggesting that the D. mela-\nnogaster protein can be exported from the cell to the extra-\ncellular surface [25]. CG2918 is structurally also a\nmember of the HSP family of proteins with strong homol-\nogy to mammalian hypoxia up-regulated protein ROP150\n[26].\nFive of the aforementioned AG protein-folding and stress-\nresponse proteins possess a K\/HDEL C-terminal sequence\n(the C-terminus of CG2918 is HSEL) suggesting that these\nproteins are resident in the lumen of the endoplasmic\nreticulum. However, it is well documented that proteins\nentering the secretory pathway can escape KDEL-mediated\nendoplasmic reticulum-retention to have a functional role\nat the cell surface or in the extracellular milieu [23,27].\nIndeed, recent studies have shown that cell-surface chap-\nerone proteins can have important roles in reproduction\nby functioning as intercellular signalling molecules that\nfacilitate sperm-oocyte interaction [28-30].\nAcp36DE (CG7157), cysteine-rich protein (CG17575) and \nserpin-3 (spn-3, CG9334)\nAcp36DE (CG7157) has been extensively studied and\nshown to be required for sperm storage [12,14,31],\nalthough the mechanism by which this is achieved is not\nknown. CG17575 has been shown by comparative struc-\ntural modelling to be a member of the CRISP family\n(cysteine-rich secretory protein) [16]. Interestingly, mam-\nmalian CRISP-1 is secreted by the proximal epididymis,\nbinds to the sperm surface, and appears to be involved in\ngamete fusion [32]. CRISP-2 is secreted from spermato-\ncytes and facilitates enhanced binding of spermatocytes to\nSertoli cells. Allurin, another CRISP, acts as a sperm che-\nmoattractant produced by female Xenopus as part of the\negg jelly [33]. In addition to these suggested roles in repro-\nduction, CRISP proteins of the CRISP-3 class might also\nform part of the innate immune defence system [34].\nAntibodies raised to recombinant CG17575 were used in\na recent study to determine the fate of the protein in the\nmated female. Western blot analyses suggested a broad\ndistribution for CG17575 in female reproductive tissues,\nincluding the uterus, oviduct and egg surface [18], consist-\nent with a possible role in gamete fusion.\nTwo members (Acp76A and Acp62F) of the serpin family\nwere previously known to be present in D. melanogaster\nAG secretions. The proteomic identification of SPN-3\ntakes the number of D. melanogaster AG serpins to three\nand this number might be an underestimate, since Swan-\nson and colleagues identified six AG serpin genes in D.\nTable 1: D. melanogaster accessory gland proteins identified by proteomics.

The\nexpression of a number of serpin family genes in the AG\nprobably reflects the importance to the male of control-\nling proteolysis by serine peptidases in the seminal fluid\n[16]. Evidence for such a role for serpins in animal repro-\nduction comes from studies on male mice lacking the ser-\npins, PCI and nexin-1 [35,36]. These animals display\nabnormal spermatogenesis and malformation of the cop-\nulatory plug presumably as a result of a failure to control\npeptidase activity. Immunological studies on the fates of\nD. melanogaster Acps in the female, post-copulation, iden-\ntified CG9334 in both the mating plug and the sperm\nstorage organs [18].\nAcid lipase (CG31872)\nThe AGs of D. melanogaster are known to be a rich source\nof an acid lipase capable of cleaving triacylglycerol and to\nsome extent cholesterol esters. Smith et al. showed that\nthe lipase activity of males was halved after mating,\nwhereas the activity in mated females was three-times that\nof virgin female flies, indicating transfer in the seminal\nfluid to the female during copulation [37]. Our proteom-\nics analysis has identified CG31872 as a candidate for this\nactivity. These enzymes might have an important role in\nproviding energy for motile sperm by hydrolysing triglyc-\nerides to release free fatty acids for \u03b2-oxidation. The work\nof Mueller et al. [17]identified five acid lipase related AG\nESTs of D. simulans and therefore we might expect addi-\ntional lipases to be present in the AGs of D. melanogaster.\nProcathepsin protein (CG4847) and the demonstration of \npro-form of a cysteine peptidase in AG secretions\nCG4847 encodes a protein that structurally belongs to the\npapain (C1A) family of cysteine peptidases and is related\nto mammalian cathepsin K, L and S (Fig. 2) [38]. CG4847\nhas a predicted molecular weight of 44 kDa in its unproc-\nessed form and, uniquely for this peptidase family,\nposesses a Gly-Gly-Gly-Phe\/Leu repeat sequence close to\nthe N-terminus of the protein. BLAST search of the pre-\ndicted proteins of the Drosophila pseudoobscura genome\nidentified GA18475 as a close homologue of CG4847 that\nshares 68% identity at the amino acid level. The predicted\nD. pseudoobscura also has a Gly\/Leu-rich region following\na signal peptide; however this region is shorter than that\nin CG4847 (Fig. 2).\nCathepsins are typically synthesised as inactive pro-\nenzymes that, under favourable conditions, undergo\nintracellular auto-cleavage that removes an N-terminal\npro-domain to generate an active peptidase of around 24\nkDa in size [39]. The observation that CG4847 migrates in\nSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a mass of\naround 50 kDa and the fact that the peptide mass finger-\nprint contained five peptides from the predicted pro-\ndomain, indicates that the enzyme is secreted with a typi-\ncal zymogen structure (Fig. 2). We sought enzymatic evi-\ndence for the synthesis and secretion of a pro-cathepsin\ncysteine peptidase by male AGs. AG contents were incu-\nbated in activation buffer, prior to performing a standard\nassay for C1A cathepsins using the substrate Cbz-Leu-Arg-\nMCA in a continuous assay for peptidase activity. The\nhydrolysis of the substrate was linear with time and was\nstrongly inhibited by two irreversible inhibitors of\ncysteine peptidases (E64 and K11777), all at a concentra-\ntion of 10 \u00b5M (Table 2). Mammalian pro-cathepsin K, like\nmany other cysteine peptidases, undergoes autoactivation\nas a result of a conformational change on lowering the pH\n[40]. The induced structural change exposes the pro-cathe-\npsin K active site to increase the susceptibility of the pro-\npeptide to cleavage. When the activation procedure for the\nAG cysteine peptidase was performed at 4\u00b0C rather than\nat 35\u00b0C, the peptidase activity was greatly reduced (Table\n2). This result is consistent with the peptidase being\nsecreted as a zymogen that can be activated in a tempera-\nture-dependent manner at low pH. It is possible that the\nactivation of the AG cysteine peptidase occurs after insem-\nination by autocatalysis after experiencing a change in pH\nin the female reproductive tract or by exposure to another\npeptidase either present in the seminal fluid or secreted\nfrom female reproductive tissues.\nA potential role for the CG4847 is in the proteolytic\nprocessing of hormone precursors. The predicted protein\nis structurally related to mammalian cathepsin L, which in\nsecretory vesicles of chromaffin cells functions as a pro-\nA representative 2-D gel (pH 4\u20137) stained with Coomassie blu , showing the separation of proteins from 80 male AGsFigure 1\nA representative 2-D gel (pH 4\u20137) stained with Coomassie \nblue, showing the separation of proteins from 80 male AGs. \nProtein spots that were unambiguously identified as secreted \nproteins in this experiment are labelled. 1, CG9429; 2, \nCG4147; 3, CG4847; 4, CG17575.\n25 kDa\n1\n2\n3\n4\n100 kDa\npI 4 - 7Page 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nProteome Science 2006, 4:9 http:\/\/www.proteomesci.com\/content\/4\/1\/9hormone processing peptidase responsible for the pro-\nduction of enkephalin peptides [41]. The cathepsin L\nrecognises monobasic and dibasic processing sites with\nthe positively charged side-chains occupying either the S1\nor S1' sub-sites. Two D. melanogaster AG prohormones,\novulin and sex peptide, undergo proteolytic processing in\nthe post-mated female and in both cases, basic residues\nare the cleavage recognition sites [7,11]. CG4847 might\nperform a similar prohormone processing role to cathep-\nsin L and be involved in the cleavage of both ovulin and\nsex peptide after transfer to the mated female. We have\ninvestigated the possibility that the AG cysteine peptidase\nis responsible for the cleavage of the sex peptide by testing\nwhether the activated enzyme can cleave sex peptide 1\u201313\n(WEWPWNRKPTKFP), which contains two potential pro-\nhormone cleavage sites, at the Arg7-Lys8 and Lys11-Phe12\npeptide bonds. HPLC analysis with UV detection (280\nnm) identified a single major cleavage product that was\nidentified as WEWPWNRKPTK by MALDI-MS ([M+H]+ m\/\nz 1528). This hydrolysis was completely blocked in the\npresence of 10 \u00b5M E64, confirming that the AG cysteine\npeptidase activity was responsible. Peng et al. have shown\nthat the N-terminal region of sex peptide is required for\nsperm attachment and for the long-term post-mating\nresponse of females [7]. They have also shown that mutat-\ning the Arg7 and Lys8 to Gln7 and Gln8 prevents the release\nof sex peptide from the surface of the sperm tail over a 5\nday period, which suggests that proteolysis occurs at, or\nclose to, the dibasic motif. Since the AG cysteine peptidase\nactivity cleaves Lys11-Phe12, which is four peptide bonds\naway from Arg7-Lys8, it is unlikely that the enzyme has a\nmajor role in the processing of the sex peptide in the post-\nmated female.\nClustalX amino acid sequence alignment of D. melanogaster cathepsin K (Dm cathepsinK, CG4847), D. pseudoobscura cathepsin K (Dp cathepsinK, GA18475) and human cathepsin K, S, and LFigure 2\nClustalX amino acid sequence alignment of D. melanogaster cathepsin K (Dm cathepsinK, CG4847), D. pseudoobscura cathepsin \nK (Dp cathepsinK, GA18475) and human cathepsin K, S, and L.

The proenzyme\nundergoes autocatalytic cleavage to generate the active \u03b3-\nglutamyl transpeptidase, comprising two subunits of\naround 40 kDa and 20 kDa [43]. The catalytic nucleophile\nis the hydroxyl group of the threonine found at the N-ter-\nminus of the smaller processed subunit [44]. The AG pep-\ntide fragments identified in the present study came from a\nprotein spot with an estimated size of around 20 kDa and\ncorresponded to sequences within the predicted smaller\nsubunit of GGT-1 (Fig. 3). The SignalP 3.0 server predicts\nwith high probability that GGT-1 is a preproprotein com-\nprising an N-terminal signal peptide for secretion and that\nthis is cleaved at the Gly30-Leu31 bond to generate a solu-\nble, secreted \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase [45]. The predicted\nsoluble nature of GGT-1 is unusual for members of this\nfamily of enzymes, since eukaryotic \u03b3-glutamyl transpepti-\ndases are typically type II integral membrane proteins\nfound on the external surfaces of cells [42]. There are three\nother \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase genes (CG17636,\nCG1492 and CG4829) in the D. melanogaster genome, all\nof which are predicted by SignalP 3.0 to encode proteins\nthat conform to a membrane-bound structure. In D. pseu-\ndoobscura, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase genes are fewer in\nnumber and the family is represented by one secreted\n(GA9613) and only one membrane-bound \u03b3-glutamyl\ntranspeptidase (GA13353): these are closely related to D.\nmelanogaster GGT-1 and CG4829, respectively.\nWe found strong \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase activity (28.1\n\u00b1 1.7 \u00b5moles of p-nitroanilide released\/h\/AG; mean \u00b1\nstandard error of the mean, n = 3) in the Drosophila AG\nusing \u03b3-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide as the substrate donor and\nthe dipeptide, Gly-Gly, as the acceptor. There was a linear\nincrease in enzyme activity, which was absolutely depend-\nent on the presence of Gly-Gly and was inhibited by aciv-\nicin (0.4 mM, 98% inhibition), a selective inhibitor of \u03b3-\nglutamyl transpeptidase. The AG \u03b3-glutamyl transpepti-\ndase activity is not associated with cell membranes since\nalmost all of the activity of the AG homogenate was found\nin the supernatant after centrifugation at 60,000 g for 2 h\n(25.1 \u00b1 2.3 \u00b5moles of p-nitroanilide released\/h\/AG; mean\n\u00b1 standard error of the mean, n = 3).\nThe identification of a secreted \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase\nin the AG is of particular interest in respect of redox con-\ntrol during reproduction. \u03b3-Glutamyl transpeptidase has a\ncentral position in the '\u03b3-glutamyl cycle', generating gluta-\nmate and Cys-Gly by cleavage of GSH. The dipeptide is\nsubsequently cleaved to its constituent amino acids [46],\nwhich are taken-up across the plasma membrane and\nused in the re-synthesis of intracellular GSH. GSH pro-\nvides reducing equivalents for the reduction of hydrogen\nperoxide and lipid hydroperoxides by glutathione peroxi-\ndases and peroxiredoxins, and is required for detoxifica-\ntion reactions carried out by glutathione S-transferases\n[47,48]. The maintenance of a high intracellular concen-\ntration of GSH is therefore important for preventing\ninjury to the germ cells by reactive oxygen species and\nxenobiotics, and is highly dependent upon the break-\ndown and recycling of extracellular GSH compounds [48].\nThe soluble AG \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase activity pro-\nvides an explanation for the relatively high levels of free\nglutamic acid known to be present in AG secretions of vir-\ngin males of D. melanogaster and the rise in uterine gluta-\nmate in the post-mated female [49].\nConclusion\nInterest in the male AG products of D. melanogaster has\nmainly focused on the proteins and peptides that are\nresponsible for altering the behaviour and physiology of\nthe post-mated female. There have been few biochemical\nstudies of AG enzymes that are secreted into the seminal\nfluid for transfer to the female, although their importance\nfor reproduction is recognised. The sequencing of male-\nspecific cDNAs of D. simulans AG gave an indication of the\nvariety of new proteins that might be present in the semi-\nnal fluid of this species and probably other drosophilids.\nHowever, this study was biased against proteins that are\nexpressed in both adult male and female flies, and did not\nshed light on any post-translational modifications that\nmight be critical for biological activity. We have used the\ncomplementary approach of proteomics to expand our\nknowledge of the secreted AG proteins, mainly enzymes\nand stress-response proteins, of D. melanogaster. We have\nprovided enyzmatic evidence for an inactive cysteine pro-\ntease and a processed and fully active \u03b3-glutamyl\nTable 2: Peptidase activity of D. melanogaster accessory glands. \nResults are expressed as the mean of three experiments \u00b1 s.e.m\nEnzyme activity Rate of hydrolysis (pmol of 7-\nAMC released\/h\/AG)\nCysteine peptidase\npre-activation 0.7 \u00b1 0.1\npost-activation 4.5 \u00b1 1.3\npost-activation + 0.1 \u00b5M E64 0.18 \u00b1 0.01\npost-activation + 0.1 \u00b5M \nK11777\n0.25 \u00b1 0.03Page 6 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nProteome Science 2006, 4:9 http:\/\/www.proteomesci.com\/content\/4\/1\/9transpeptidase in support of the proteomics data. The\ncysteine peptidase might undergo activation in the extra-\ncellular environment and, if transferred to the female dur-\ning copulation, might have a role in the processing of\nmale derived proteins (e.g. ovulin) in the mated female.\nD. melanogaster is amenable to reverse genetic approaches,\nwhich can now be used to determine the importance and\nprecise role of the identified AG proteins in reproduction.\nMethods\nMaterials\nPeptidase substrates and inhibitors, unless otherwise\nstated, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.

Iso-\nelectric focusing was performed using a PROTEAN IEF cell\n(Bio-Rad) for 40000 Vh. The strip was then equilibrated in\ntwo base buffers (50 mM Tris\/Cl, 2% (v\/v) SDS, 6 M urea,\nand 20% glycerol) containing first 1.4 M diothiothreitol\nand then 1.3 M iodoacetamide. The second dimension\nused precast 8\u201316% Tris\/HCl gels (Bio-Rad) and was run\nfor 70 min at 200 V. The gel was washed three times for 15\nmin prior to staining with Coomassie (\"biosafe\" Bio-Rad)\nfor 3 h before de-staining with water.\nStained spots of protein were cut using a Proteome Works\nspot-cutter (Bio-Rad) before being placed in 50 mM\nammonium bicarbonate and 50 % (v\/v) acetonitrile. The\ngel piece was sonicated for 10 min with the supernatant\nbeing removed and discarded. This was repeated before\nacetonitrile was added and then the gel was dried. The\ntrypsin digest was then carried out by adding 5 \u00b5l trypsin\nsolution (2 ng of trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbo-\nnate) to the gel piece and allowing it to be absorbed\nbefore addition of another 5 \u00b5l of 25 mM ammonium\nbicarbonate 30 min later. Digestion was allowed to pro-\nceed for 16 h at 37\u00b0C.\nMALDI-MS was performed using a matrix of 5 mg of \u03b1-\ncyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid in 1 ml ethanol\/ace-\ntonitrile (1:1, v\/v) with the peptide ACTH used as an inter-\nnal standard. The matrix was then mixed with the sample\nin a ratio of 1:1 with 1 \u00b5l being spotted onto a MALDI tar-\nget plate for analysis using MALDI-TOF (Micromass\nM@LDI L\/R system) to generate a peptide mass finger-\nprint. The NCBI and MSDB peptide databases were\nsearched using Mascot http:\/\/www.matrixscience.com\/\nsearch_form_select.html with, 100 p.p.m. accuracy and\ncarbamidomethyl transformation selected. Some protein\nspots were analysed by LC-MS\/MS and the fragmentation\ndata was used to search the NCBI and MSDB peptide data-\nbases using Mascot as described previously [52]\nEnzyme assays\nAG contents were separated from the AG tissue by centrif-\nugation in small volumes of Ringer solution, typically 20\npairs of AGs in 40 \u00b5l, at 10 000 g at 4\u00b0C. For the determi-\nnation of cysteine peptidase activity, AG samples were\nincubated in activation buffer (100 mM sodium acetate\nbuffer, pH 5.5; 5 mM EDTA; 20 mM cysteine) at 35\u00b0C,\neither without inhibitor or with one of two cysteine pepti-\ndase inhibitors (E64 and K11777). After 1 h, the substrate\n(Cbz-Leu-Arg-MCA) was added to a final concentration of\n10 \u00b5M in 1% (v\/v) dimethyl sulfoxide and the fluores-\ncence emitted during the reaction was measured every 90\nseconds in black 96-well microtitre plates (Corning Life\nSciences, High Wycombe, U.K.) at ambient temperature\nusing a Victor2 fluorometer (PerkinElmer\u2122, Finland) and\nan excitation \u03bb of 380 nm and emission \u03bb of 460 nm.\nReaction rates were linear up to 2 h (1 unit of activity is 1\npmol of 7-AMC released\/h). Cysteine peptidase activity\ntowards sex peptide1-13 was performed by incubating the\ncontents from 50 AGs in 50 \u00b5l of activation buffer for 1 h\nat 35\u00b0C, before adding sex peptide1-13 (50 \u00b5M, final con-\ncentration). After incubation for 12 h at 35\u00b0C, hydrolytic\nactivity was terminated by lowering the pH to 2 with 5 \u00b5l\nof 8% (v\/v) TFA. Cleavage products were analysed by\nreversed phase HPLC using a Phenomenex Jupiter C18\ncolumn (5 \u00b5m particles, 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm; Phenomenex,\nMacclesfield, U.K.) and an elution gradient of 12% ace-\ntonitrile rising to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA over 25\nmin, at a flow rate of 1 ml\/min. The elution of tryptophan\ncontaining peptides was monitored at 280 nm. The major\nproduct peak was collected and analysed by MALDI-TOF\nMS.\n\u03b3-Glutamyl transpeptidase activity was assayed using \u03b3-\nglutamyl-p-nitroanilide (1 mM) as the \u03b3-glutamyl donor\nand the dipeptide Gly-Gly (20 mM) as the acceptor in\nTris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 8) [42]. The release of p-\nnitroaniline was monitored every 10 sec in 96-well plastic\nplates (NuncTM, Denmark) using a SPECTRA MAX 340PC\nspectrometer (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, U.K.) set\nat 410 nm (\u03b5 = 8800 M-1. cm-1) and a temperature of\n25\u00b0C. The reaction rate was linear up to 1 h (1 unit of\nactivity is 1 nmol of p-nitroaniline released\/h). The solu-\nble nature of the \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase was estab-\nlished by homogenising ten AGs in 200 \u00b5l of Ringer's\nsolution in a glass homogeniser (GPE Ltd., Leighton Buz-\nzard, UK) and centrifuging the homogenate at 60,000 g\nfor 2 h in a TLA110 Beckman rotor using an Optima Max\nUltracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter UK Ltd, High\nWycombe, Buckinghamshire, U.K.).
