Introduction \n \nThe Chalk, a fine-grained and fractured coccolith limestone of Upper Cretaceous age, is an \nimportant aquifer across NW Europe (Downing et al., 1993).   Although generally valued for \nits landscape and ecology, the Chalk has in places been intensively quarried primarily for the \nmanufacture of cement.  The resulting large-scale excavations inevitably have some effect on \nregional hydrogeology, but the dual-porosity nature of the Chalk aquifer (fractured but with a \nhighly porous matrix: Price et al., 1993) means that these may be difficult to resolve or \nattribute.  Clearly therefore, achieving a better understanding of groundwater movements in \nsuch areas is highly desirable. \n \nAn opportunity to do this has been provided by the Swanscombe area in the county of Kent, \nSE England.  Here, quarrying has recently ceased and the resulting kilometre-scale \nexcavations have been, or are in the process of being, redeveloped.  At the same time, \ninterception of groundwater presently draining to the quarried area is envisaged as an \nadditional means of meeting the region\u2019s high water demand.  This paper is concerned with \nthe use of environmental tracers as an adjunct to more conventional hydrogeological \ntechniques.  Previously, non-point-source studies on the Chalk of NW Europe using \nenvironmental tracers have tended to focus on the unsaturated zone (e.g. Geake and Foster, \n1989; Vachier et al., 1987), or on down-gradient flowpaths extending into confined \nconditions (e.g. Smith et al., 1976; Kloppman et al., 1998).  The present study differs in \nconsidering a local Chalk unit, including river\u2013groundwater interaction, in an area of \nanthropogenic alteration and development. \n \n \n2. Background \n \n2.1. The Swanscombe Chalk Block \n \nThe Swanscombe Chalk Block is defined for present purposes as the area lying between the \nRiver Thames and the scarp of the North Downs to the north and south respectively, and the \nEbbsfleet and Darent Valleys to the east and west respectively (Fig. 1).   \n \n  3 \nIn the context of the proposed abstraction from the Swanscombe Block for public water \nsupply, the hydrogeology of the area is a sensitive issue because the River Darent, an \necologically-important Chalk stream, partially dried up in the 1990s (Rippon and Wyness, \n1994).  In addition, the river approaches to within 3 km of the quarries and the possibility of \nsub-karstic leakage from the river to the quarries has been raised. \n \nThe area is dominated by two major excavations: the Western Quarry, redeveloped since \n1999 as the Bluewater retail park, and the larger Eastern Quarry, now being infilled as part of \nthe Ebbsfleet Valley redevelopment programme, the largest development site in the Thames \nGateway region.  \n \nDuring the period of chalk extraction the base of the quarries was below sea level (down to \n\u221210 m AOD), and therefore they acted as a sump for groundwater flow in the vicinity.  \nLatterly between 20 and 40 10\n3\nm\n3\n\/d were being pumped out of the Eastern Quarry.  In \ngeneral terms, while some flow against the natural pre-development gradient towards the \nThames probably has occurred, it is proportionally of little significance since the median \nchloride concentration of quarry discharge during the study was 36 mg\/l compared to the \n>6000 mg\/l in the tidal Thames at Dartford.  Most flow into the quarries is therefore \npresumed to be derived from the Chalk block to the south which, based on annual recharge of \n~200 mm, is more than capable of supplying this volume of water.  However, the existence of \ngentle easterly-trending anticlines and synclines south of the quarries means that direct S\u2013N \nflowlines might not necessarily exist.  In this possibly complex flow system, the hydrological \nsituation of the River Darent has remained relatively unclear.  Although river valleys are \ntypically zones of groundwater discharge, Chalk streams are well known for their tendency to \nhave gaining and losing reaches even in the absence of large-scale groundwater abstraction \n(e.g. Grapes et al.,  2005).  In the lower Darent Valley the existence of several public supply \npumping stations is likely to have reinforced any pre-existing complexity. \n \nWith such questions in mind, prior to the present redevelopment, and while chalk quarrying \nwas still being carried out by Lafarge Cement UK, the area was studied by Thames Water \nUtilities Ltd (TWUL) to assess the groundwater resources of the Swanscombe Chalk Block.  \nIt was clear from the amount of groundwater entering the Eastern Quarry via diffuse or sub-\nkarstic fracture \u2018pipe flow\u2019 that a considerable amount of water was potentially available for \ndevelopment (Tyler-Whittle, 1999) but little was known about this resource in terms of \n  4 \nflowpaths, residence time or relationship with the River Darent.  As part of the \nhydrogeological assessment it was decided to use \u2018environmental tracers\u2019, i.e. a range of \ndissolved constituents chosen to reveal different aspects of the water\u2019s origin.   \n \n2.2. Environmental tracers \n \nThe term \u2018environmental tracer\u2019 simply means the hydrogeochemical imprinting of a \ngroundwater due to its origin as recharge and\/or its subsequent evolution.  Some of this \nimprinting is natural (e.g. stable isotope signatures), but it may also result from anthropogenic \nfactors (e.g. point-source pollution).  It may be the result of a particular event (e.g. \nthermonuclear tritium), or a continuing input (e.g. chlorofluorocarbons).  Tracers may be \nreactive (e.g. evolving inorganic water quality) or non-reactive (e.g. sulphur hexafluoride). \n \nIn the Chalk the simplest environmental tracer, inorganic chemistry, is often not especially \nuseful because the excessively fine-grained nature of the rock matrix leads quickly to a rather \nuniform hydrochemical composition which tends to change only over longer timescales \n(Edmunds et al., 1987).  At Swanscombe, most flowlines are unlikely to be long enough for \nthis to occur to a significant extent.  Therefore, three other types of tracer were chosen for the \ninvestigations: (i) O and H stable isotopes; (ii) the trace gases CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113 \nand SF6; and (iii) \n3\nH.  Each of these types has certain unique properties, although there may \nbe overlap in the information they provide. \n \n2.2.1. Stable isotopes \nThe ratios of \n18\nO\/\n16\nO and \n2\nH\/\n1\nH imparted to groundwaters at recharge tend to remain the \nsame in the subsurface, at least over the relatively brief residence times of Chalk \ngroundwaters.  These ratios vary systematically across the UK owing to the balance between \nrainout, topography and temperature (Darling et al. 2003).  For surface waters, however, \nisotope ratios may change with time either owing to evaporation, or seasonal rainfall inputs \n(Darling and Talbot, 2003).  The existence of these two effects \u2013 regional variations and \nsurface water differences \u2013 may allow areal recharge to be resolved from river leakage.    \n \n2.2.2. Trace gases \nThe use of the chlorofluorocarbons CFC-11 (CCl3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2) and CFC-113 \n(C2Cl3F3) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) as age tracers is based on the known rise of their \n  5 \nconcentrations in the atmosphere over the past half-century, the observation that they are \nwell-mixed in the atmosphere, and the assumption that they dissolve in water according to \ntheir Henry\u2019s Law solubilities at the recharge temperature (Plummer and Busenberg 1999).  \nIn the case of the Swanscombe area recharge temperature is taken as being 10\u00b0C, based on \nthe regional mean annual air temperature (Tout, 1976).  Figure 2 shows the concentrations of \nCFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113 and SF6 to be expected in groundwater recharged between the \nyears 1950 and 2005 at a temperature of 10\u00b0C.  Providing there is no subsurface addition, \ngroundwater concentrations can then be directly related to the year of recharge.  However, the \nCFCs in particular are prone to augmentation under certain circumstances (H\u00f6hener et al., \n2003).  In such an event they may still be useable as flowpath tracers.   \n \n2.2.3. Tritium \nThe aerial thermonuclear weapons testing of the mid-1960s injected a large amount of tritium \n(\n3\nH) into the atmosphere, providing a marker for the presence of groundwater recharged in \nthe past ~50 years.  By the end of the 20\nth\n Century, the \n3\nH activity of rainfall had declined to \nnear-background levels as a result of rainout and the relatively short half-life of \n3\nH (12.3 yrs).  \nA further complication is that some landfills may be sources of elevated \n3\nH (Robinson and \nGronow, 1996).  Despite these potential limitations, \n3\nH can still play a useful role in \ngroundwater investigations by providing a crosscheck on information obtained from the \ntrace-gas indicators.   \n \n \n3. Sample collection and analysis \n \nIn the Darent Valley, a number of locations from Westerham downstream were chosen to \ncharacterise the river water, in four cases being sited as near as feasible to public water \nsupply groundwater pumping stations (Fig. 3).  \n \nAbout a dozen private and TWUL test boreholes were available for sampling in a 3 km-wide \nzone to the south of the quarries.  Two instances of pipe flow from the southern face of the \nEastern Quarry were also sampled (Fig. 3).   \n \n  6 \nSampling for stable isotopes and tritium was carried out by collecting unfiltered samples of \nriver or groundwater in glass bottles of 28 ml and 1 litre respectively.  Samples for CFC and \nSF6 analysis were collected in ground-glass-stoppered bottles immersed within metal cans \ncontaining the same water to prevent atmospheric contamination (based on the method of \nOster, 1994).   \n \nBorehole samples were considered to be representative of groundwater in the vicinity, with \nthe possible exception of CFCs and SF6 in the Test BHs 3 and 7, in which cascading in the \nwellbore could be heard and from which \u2018gassy\u2019 water was obtained, indicating the \npossibility of gaseous exchange, which would presumably tend towards re-equilibration with \nthe atmosphere.  BH 3 appeared to be affected more than BH 7.  Samples collected from the \npipe flows in the Eastern Quarry may have been similarly affected. \n \nAnalysis for stable isotopes was carried out by dual-inlet mass spectrometry at the \nWallingford laboratories of the British Geological Survey (BGS) after preparation by \nstandard techniques.  Isotope ratios are expressed as permil (\u2030) relative to VSMOW (Vienna \nStandard Mean Ocean Water): \n \n \uf064 = [(Rsample\/Rstd)-1] \u00d7 10\n3\n \n \nTritium was analysed by RCD Lockinge (Wantage, England) by radioactive counting \nfollowing electrolytic pre-concentration.  Activities are expressed as TU (Tritium Units, \nwhere 1 TU = 1 tritium in 10\n18\n hydrogen atoms).  CFCs and SF6 were analysed by gas \nchromatography after cryogenic pre-concentration, either by Spurenstofflabor (Wachenheim, \nGermany) or by BGS Wallingford (CFC-11 and CFC-12 from 2002 to 2003).  Analyses are \nreported as pmol\/L (CFCs) and fmol\/L (SF6).  Measurements of SF6 have been corrected to \ncompensate for incorporation of \u2018excess air\u2019 during recharge.  This is based on the average \nexcess air component of 2.5 ccSTP\/L found for Chalk groundwaters by Gooddy et al. (2006).  \nSuch a component could lead to an underestimate of groundwater age of up to 5 years, \nsomewhat exceeding the effect of measurement precision and therefore considered to be \nworth applying.    \n    \n  7 \nMeasurement precisions are within \u00b10.1\u2030 for \u03b418O and \u00b11\u2030 for \u03b42H, and \u00b110% for the \nCFCs and SF6, with detection limits of 0.01 pmol\/L (CFC-12, CFC-113), 0.05 pmol\/L \n(CFC-11) and 0.1 fmol\/L (SF6).  Precision of tritium measurements is \u00b15% for activities in \nexcess of 7 TU, \u00b10.4 TU for activities from 7 to 2.5 TU, and \u00b10.3 TU for activities below this \ndown to the detection limit of 1 TU. \n \n \n4. Results \n \n4.1. Sites in the Darent Valley  \n \nResults for these sites are presented in two tables: Table 1, periodic monitoring of the stable \nisotopic composition of the river at the downstream sampling site SW7 between autumn 2001 \nand spring 2003; Table 2, low-flow and high-flow sampling of the river and valley boreholes \nfor stable isotopes, tritium and CFCs in October 2001, October 2002 and February 2003. \n \nFigure 4 shows a plot of the river-monitoring \u03b418O data from Table 1.  Also shown is the \ndaily flow of the river at SW7 (Hawley gauging station), and the date of the detailed low-\nflow and high-flow sampling, i.e. the Oct-02 and Feb-03 samples of Table 2.  The plot shows \nthat the river varies in its isotopic composition well beyond measurement error, reaching its \nmost depleted (negative) composition in the high-flow period of early 2003.  Typically winter \nrainfall in the UK is isotopically depleted compared to the whole-year weighted mean \n(Darling and Talbot 2003), so the more negative winter river values may simply reflect this.  \n \nFigure 5 shows a \u03b418O\u2013\u03b42H plot based on sampling in the river valley in October 2001, \nOctober 2002 and February 2003 (data from Table 2).  In both autumns, the river water is \nisotopically enriched (i.e. less negative).  Overall the river data give a regression with a slope \nof 5.2, typical of evaporation from surface waters.  This may be attributable to a degree of \nevaporative enrichment occurring in the river, most likely largely due to exposure in gravel \npit lakes.  The most notable of these (approximately 1 x 0.5 km in size) occurs above the \nChalk block on the Gault Clay in the vicinity of Sevenoaks, so sampling points SW2 and \nSW3 were added above and below the lake for the low-flow\/high-flow sampling campaigns, \nplus an extra point above the lake (SW1, Fig. 3) for the final sampling.  The October 2002 \nresults (Table 2) confirm that in the autumn the composition of river water below the lake is \n  8 \nenriched following the higher temperatures and longer lake turnover of summer.   Above the \nlake, river values appear to be constant, and in better agreement with the expected \ncomposition of a river largely derived from groundwater in this area (Darling et al.,  2003).   \n \nThe river valley public supply pumping stations (PSs) on the other hand show little evidence \nof seasonal change.  Nevertheless they are on average slightly isotopically enriched compared \nto the mean for boreholes away from the river (\u20137.3\u2030 in \u03b418O, see next section), which could \nbe explained by a river water contribution of about one-fifth assuming an average river \ncomposition between SW4 and SW7 of \u20136.7 \u2030 \u03b418O (Table 2).  Comparisons between the \npumping stations and the river composition at different seasons are probably inappropriate, \npartly because the isotopic variations in the river depicted in Fig. 4 seem likely to be \nsmoothed out in the hyporheic zone, but also because of a lack of the detailed piezometric \ndata necessary to establish head gradients.  \n \nTritium was analysed for two river\u2013borehole pairs in the lower part of the valley (SW6 \/ \nHorton Kirby PS, SW7 \/ Darenth PS).  The results (Table 2) show that the river had a \nsignificant tritium content (up to 15 TU) at the low-flow sampling, with a decline to about \n70% of this at the high-flow sampling.  Although there are no published monitoring data for \ntritium in UK rainfall in recent years, study of records from NW Europe shows that the \nactivity of tritium in winter rainfall is typically around 50% of that in the summer (see the \nIAEA-WMO Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation or GNIP, \nhttp:\/\/nds121.iaea.org\/wiser\/index.php).  Allowing for a degree of damping due to bank \nstorage, the Darent results are consistent with this.  The Darent average activity during the \nstudy period of approximately 11 TU may reflect mean rainfall composition in the area; but \nwould be almost twice the value (~6TU) indicated by the UK composite input function used \nin connection with groundwater dating in the next section.  This raises the possibility that \nupstream inputs of groundwater with a remanent thermonuclear \n3\nH content are contributing, \nbut no information on the tritium activities of the Chalk and Lower Greensand groundwater \nfeeding the upper reaches of the river is available to test this. \n \nThe relatively high tritium activities in the river are to an extent reflected in the river valley \nPS outputs at Horton Kirby and Darenth, which have activities exceeding any measured in \nboreholes away from the vicinity of the river (see next section).  This suggests that up to one-\nthird of the pumped water could ultimately be derived from the river, though the uncertainties \n  9 \nassociated with such a limited dataset are large and require consideration along with more \ndirect hydrological and hydrogeological flow and hydraulic head data.  As with the stable \nisotopes, there is little seasonal change in \n3\nH activity, supporting the concept that any water \nabstracted from the river is already well mixed in the hyporheic zone or adjacent Chalk. \n \nThe CFC-12 compositions reported in Table 2 are shown in map form (Fig. 6) in terms of \n\u2018modern fraction\u2019, i.e. the fraction of modern air-equilibrated water in the sample assuming \nmixing between present-day recharge and pre-CFC (>50 yrs) groundwater.  This is based on \nthe Northern Hemisphere atmospheric mixing ratio curves \n(http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/lab\/software\/air_curve\/), and the conclusion of Darling and Gooddy \n(2007) that these are likely to be applicable to southern England.  Although the measured \nriver water concentrations change significantly between October and February (Table 2), \nonce they are corrected for temperature-related solubility effects most of the river waters give \na modern fraction value of ~1, implying they are in equilibrium with the atmosphere.  By \ncontrast, the borehole waters vary much less seasonally and show a change from below-\nmodern values in the south to considerably greater than modern in the north.  The latter \nindicates a degree of CFC addition, most likely in the subsurface.  Horton Kirby PS is about 4 \ntimes modern, and Darenth PS about 9 times modern.  Each shows a slight decline for the \nhigh-flow sampling, but these could be the same within measurement error.  CFC-11 is \nelevated to a similar extent as CFC-12 at both sites, indicating the source of enhancement is \nnot biased towards a particular CFC species.  There are landfilled areas in the vicinity of each \nPS, and these or light industrial activity are likely to be the cause of the CFC enhancement.   \n \nFrom the river water analyses at Horton Kirby and Darenth there is little overt evidence of \nany outflow of CFC-enhanced groundwater to the river.  Gauge data suggest minor loss from \nthe river at the low-flow sampling, but a minor gain from groundwater at the high-flow \nsampling, so higher CFC concentrations might have been expected in the river at this time.   \nDecay of CFCs during infiltration has been observed for some rivers (H\u00f6hener et al.,  2003), \nbut Chalk stream hyporheic zones, where so far measured, do not achieve the low-oxygen \nstatus necessary for CFC reduction (Pretty et al., 2006; Allen et al., in press).  Alternatively, it \nis possible that the relatively shallow depth of the river promotes rapid atmospheric \nequilibration and attenuation of any CFC signal, even if the discharging groundwater is at \n~10 times the modern background.  Further research on river\u2013atmosphere gas exchange rates \nwould be required to confirm or disprove this. \n  10 \n4.2. Sites in the Eastern Quarry and adjacent area  \n \nThese include PS and private boreholes, Test boreholes, the Western Quarry borehole BW6, \nand two instances of significant pipe flow into the Eastern Quarry at Washmills and Cherry \nOrchard (Fig. 3).  The pipe flows were among the first sites of the present study to be \nsampled (March 2001), when special sampling facilities were temporarily installed because \nof the otherwise difficult access to the normally copious flows (Tyler-Whittle, 1999).  A \nborehole sampling campaign was undertaken during the approximately two-month-long \ngroup pump testing of the Test boreholes in November 2002 (details of the testing are \nprovided in Mansour et al., subm.).  While the testing caused the Cherry Orchard flow  \neffectively to cease, by April 2003 it had recovered sufficiently for a final sampling (though \nonly for isotopes, since access difficulties precluded the collection of the air-free samples \nnecessary for trace gas analysis).   \n \nThe O and H stable isotope data (Table 2) are reasonably well correlated, so \uf06418O will be \nused to illustrate processes, as with the river data above.   The data (Table 2) show that there \nis no significant difference between the boreholes sampled in 2001 and 2002; this is as \nexpected particularly since the boreholes (except for BW6) were sampled in the same season \n(autumn).  However, the Washmills pipe flow was sampled in March 2001 and November \n2002, but again no significant change was noted.  \n \nTritium results (Table 2) show that Court Lodge Farm, Hook Place Farm and Southfleet PS, \nwhich are believed to represent groundwater recharged areally by rainfall, have values of \napproximately 1\u20133 TU.  Apart from the river valley boreholes (Darenth PS and Horton Kirby \nPS), most other sites are within (or within measurement error of) this range.  The exceptions \nare BH 7 (slightly higher) and the Washmills inflow (significantly higher).   In the context of \na likely rainfall mean \n3\nH activity of 6\u20137 TU over the sampling period, groundwater values in \nthe range 1\u20133 TU imply waters either a decade or two in age or, more likely in the Chalk, \nmixtures of recent recharge with \u2018dead\u2019 pre-thermonuclear tritium water (i.e. >50 yrs).  The \nhigher values from BH 7 and the Washmills inflow (4.6 and 8.4 TU respectively) suggest a \ngreater proportion of modern water and\/or a possible landfill contribution. \n \n  11 \nMaps of CFC distribution are shown in Fig. 7.  As with the Darent valley results discussed \nabove, the analytical results (Table 2) have been converted into \u2018modern fraction\u2019 format to \nmake comparisons between the species more straightforward.  It is apparent that the \nwidespread enhancement, characterised by modern fractions >1, is seen in all boreholes (with \nthe exception of CFC-11 and -113 at Betsham).   \n \nThe Football Field lower borehole, the only one to be depth-sampled for CFCs, revealed \nevidence of layering.  While the sample from 17 m below water table was similar in \ncomposition to the pumped discharge for both CFC-11 and CFC-12, the sample from 9 m \nwas approximately one-third lower in both CFCs (Table 2).  This layering presumably \nreflects ingress of waters derived from different flowpaths.  Chalk boreholes are not normally \nlined\/screened and localised fracture-related inflow horizons are typical (Tate et al., 1970), \ntherefore all the other boreholes in this study are likely to be producing a mixture of waters \nfrom different flow horizons.  However, information on the depth and magnitude of inflows \nis seldom known or recorded. \n \nFigure 8 shows that SF6 does not reach the levels of enhancement recorded for the CFCs.  By \nfar the highest value is seen in the Darenth Well sample.  Otherwise, only slightly above-\nmodern values are found in boreholes near landfilled areas (e.g. Pinden Quarry), the Test \nBorehole BH9 (also high in CFCs) and in the pipe flows at Washmills and Cherry Orchard, \nthough it is possible (see section 3) that the latter contain a degree of entrained air which may \nhave elevated the measured values.  While the below-modern borehole waters can be \nassigned \u2018piston flow\u2019 age values, which range from 1 to 17 years (Fig 8), these are ages that \ntake no account of mixing.  Since this is likely in unconfined Chalk aquifers particularly \nwhere karstified (e.g. Darling et al., 2005), it may be safer to assume that the borehole waters \nare mixtures between modern and pre-SF6 deeper waters, and that the modern fraction values \nof Fig. 8 are the most appropriate way to interpret the data.  \n  \nIt should be emphasised that the enhanced CFC and SF6 concentrations observed for some \nsites are still well below the drinking water limit for dissolved organics (currently 1 \u03bcg\/L).  \nFor example, a CFC-11 concentration of 300 pmol\/L, equivalent to a modern fraction value \nof ~50,  would be equivalent to only 0.04 \u03bcg\/L on a weight-per-volume basis.  \n \n \n  12 \n5. Discussion \n \n5.1. Isotopic variations in the River Darent \n \nRivers rising and flowing wholly on the Chalk depend almost entirely on groundwater inputs \nand therefore vary little beyond measurement precision in their stable isotopic composition \n(e.g. Lawler 1987).  The Darent cannot be regarded as a typical \u2018chalk stream\u2019 as the upper \n30% of its course lies mostly on the Gault Clay that stratigraphically underlies the Chalk.  \nThis part of the course is likely to be the main contributor to the variation in composition \nobserved in the river at the various downstream sampling points (Figs 4 and 5).  The \nenrichment in isotopic composition observed during the autumn low-flow periods of 2001 \nand 2002 argues against major flow accretion where the river passes over the Chalk outcrop, \nsince the groundwater in the Chalk Block away from the river valley is comparatively \ndepleted in isotopic terms (Table 2). \n \n5.2. The relationship between the River Darent and groundwater in the quarried area \n \nSub-karstic features as exemplified in visible form by the Washmills and Cherry Orchard \nfracture pipes are typically developed in the Chalk where acidic waters have penetrated from \npresent or now-eroded Palaeogene cover rocks (Maurice et al, 2006).  Yields from the Test \nboreholes, all drilled through Palaeogene cover, were highly variable (Mansour et al.,  subm.) \nsuggesting that sub-karst is extensively developed in the vicinity.  While the extent of this \nsub-karst beyond the present Palaeogene cover is impossible to ascertain directly, \nenvironmental tracers provide some indirect evidence.   \n \nIn stable isotopic terms, the Test boreholes (Table 2) are compositionally distinct from the \nriver waters, even when these are at their most depleted (Table 1, Fig. 4), and this therefore \nappears to limit the proportional amount of river leakage (if any) that might be flowing \ntowards the Eastern Quarry.  Taking values from boreholes which are highly unlikely to have \nany component of river water (Beslee, Betsham, Court Lodge Farm, Hook Place Farm, \nPinden Quarry and Southfleet PS), an average areally-recharged groundwater composition of \n\u20137.3 \u00b1 0.25 \u2030 \uf06418O is implied.  The simple mean composition of river water at sampling \npoint SW7 is \u20136.7\u2030 \uf06418O, i.e. significantly different from the groundwater average.  Since all \n  13 \nthe Test boreholes and the quarry inflows are more negative than the observed river water \nrange, it appears that they cannot contain significant amounts of river water.  While there is \nsome uncertainty about the long-term range of variation in the river and consequently of any \nleakage, the river would have to have a sizeable flow more isotopically negative than that \nmeasured during the study just to reach the average groundwater composition.  It is seems \nunlikely that the approximately monthly sampling over what was a wetter-than-average \nwinter could have missed such a flow.  Only if it is assumed that the scale of river variation \nhas been underestimated by 50%, and the true range of values is (say) from \u20136 to \u20137.5\u2030, and \nonly the most negative river water invades the Chalk Block (which is unlikely because \ngroundwater levels are normally high in the winter months, which would preclude riverbed \ninfiltration), could there be a sizeable proportion of river water in the Test boreholes, BW6 \nand the Eastern Quarry pipe flows.  In addition, the lower Football Field observation borehole \nlies between the Test boreholes and the river (Fig. 3), but also shows no evidence of a \nsignificant river water component. \n \nAlthough the Washmills inflow sample of November 2002 had a higher \n3\nH activity than local \nborehole waters, the stable isotopic evidence above makes any direct connection with the \nDarent appear unlikely, leaving the explanation that infiltration of relatively unmixed modern \nlocal recharge was responsible for the inflow.  The group test pumping (Mansour et al.,  \nsubm.) may well have affected the balance between recent recharge and older groundwater in \nthe vicinity of the quarry; there was certainly a profound reduction in the rate of discharge \nfrom the main fracture pipes during the test (see section 4.2).  Support for this interpretation \ncomes from the April 2003 sampling, by which time the pipe flows were recovering from the \neffects of the test pumping.  At Washmills the tritium activity was reducing, while at Cherry \nOrchard it was similar to the groundwater background. \n \nThe lack of above-modern SF6 values from the Test boreholes when compared to the high \nexcess at Darenth Well is some further evidence for the lack of a significant hydraulic \nconnection between the river valley and the Eastern Quarry.  In particular the relatively high  \nresidence time for BH 3, which may in reality be even higher if the sample was affected by \ncascading (see section 3), indicates an element of storage in the Chalk south of the quarried \narea. \n \n  14 \nThe environmental tracer evidence therefore indicates that karstic development is not \nwidespread enough to promote significant flow between the river and the quarries.  It may be \nnoted that the Test boreholes were sited with the aim of intercepting groundwater flowpaths \nheading towards the quarries while avoiding the drawing of water away from the river valley, \nso the above evidence is consistent with this aim having been achieved.   \n \n5.3. Groundwater flow in the area south of the Eastern Quarry \n \nThe general similarity in stable isotopic compositions of the groundwaters south of the quarry \noffers little detailed information on flowpaths.  However, the CFCs have greater potential for \nthis.  As mentioned earlier, inflow to the quarried area must basically be coming from the \nsouth.  The southernmost boreholes such as Pinden Quarry and Hook Place Farm have \ndifferent CFC fingerprints, likely due at least in part to the presence of nearby landfills \n(Fig. 7).  Since there are three CFCs, relationships between different sites can conveniently \nbe interpreted via a trilinear plot (Fig. 9).  Such plots are commonly used in the interpretation \nof inorganic hydrochemical data as a way of detecting patterns of groundwater mixing or \nevolution (e.g. Hem, 1992), though they require a certain amount of care in interpretation \nsince they depict ratios rather than absolute concentrations..  Trilinear plots do not appear to \nhave been previously applied to the interpretation of CFC data.  As with all such plots, \nconcentrations of the three CFCs need to be converted to percentages.  It is most convenient \nto do this using modern fraction values (Fig. 7), which are themselves directly proportional to \nthe measured concentrations.  Modern air-equilibrated water sits in the centre of the plot.  To \nassist in the interpretation of Fig. 9, the total CFC load in pmol\/l is also shown. \n \nIt is apparent from Fig. 9 that there are three main dilution\/mixing trends based on the \ndominance of a particular species: a CFC-11 trend (source probably to the south of BH 9) \ncould account for BH 5 and the quarry pipe flows; a CFC-12 trend probably sourced at \nPinden landfill and directed north through Betsham; and a CFC-113 trend linking Hook Place \nFarm with Court Lodge Farm and Southfleet PS.  In each case the CFC load drops with \nprogress along the assumed flowpath.  While BH 7 has an intermediate composition perhaps \nindicating mixing between the Pinden and BH 9 flowpaths, there are two sites which do not \nfit readily into this  scheme: Green Street Green PS has an extremely elevated CFC-113 \ncontent which is not reflected in any neighbouring boreholes; BH 3 may be derived from a \ndifferent, more westerly flowpath.  Nevertheless there is sufficient evidence for the existence \n  15 \nof S\u2013N flowpaths despite the E\u2013W structures in the area alluded to earlier, such as the Bean \nAnticline.   \n   \nBoth tritium and SF6 are relatively consistent in the boreholes south of the Eastern Quarry \n(Table 2, Fig. 8).  While tritium on its own can be interpreted only semi-quantitatively, a plot \nagainst SF6 brings out more detail (Fig. 10).  This shows results in the context of an SF6 \u2013 \n3\nH \npiston flow curve (see figure caption for more information).  Boreholes with a modern \nfraction <1 are arrayed close to and sub-parallel with the mixing line extending from \n\u2018modern\u2019 (in this case 2001) water to pre-SF6, tritium-dead water.  This tends to confirm that \nthe SF6 ages are best interpreted in terms of binary mixing.  Southfleet PS has the lowest \nmodern fraction, perhaps because as a public supply PS its yield is significantly greater than \nthose of the other boreholes, with the result that there is likely to be greater upconing of older \nwater.  The position on the plot of the two over-modern boreholes (BH9 observation and \nGreen Street Green) suggests that these too are basically mixed waters, but with some SF6 \nenhancement presumably from local landfill sources.   \n \n \n6. Conclusions \n \nA range of environmental tracers has been used to investigate the hydrogeology an area of \nmajor quarrying in the Chalk adjacent to a river valley at Swanscombe in north Kent.  To \nachieve this, samples were collected from surface waters, regional groundwater, and pipe \nflows from the southern face of the Eastern Quarry. \n \nThe mean O and H stable isotopic composition of the nearby River Darent differs from the \ncomposition of typical groundwaters in the Chalk Block, probably as a consequence of \nsummer evaporation effects.  This contrast indicates that major sub-karstic river leakage into \nthe Swanscombe quarried area is not occurring.  However, stable isotope and tritium data \nfrom the river and public supply boreholes suggest that between one-fifth and one-third of \nabstracted water is derived from the river in the lower part of the valley.  While there are \nuncertainties over the exact figure, it would be consistent with the view based on regional \nmodelling that below Lullingstone the river is frequently perched above the groundwater \ntable (Rippon & Wyness, 1994), with consequent potential for some river loss. \n \n  16 \nEnhanced chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) concentrations in Chalk groundwaters to the south of \nthe quarries are likely to be the product of leakage and dilution of landfill effluents with \ndiffering characteristics.  Flowpaths from south to north are clearly demonstrated in the \neastern half of the area, but less so in the west where there is more landfill activity to \ncomplicate the issue.  The above-modern concentrations rule out interpretation in terms of \nresidence time, but in no case do they exceed water quality guidelines. \n \nSub-karstic conduits certainly exist in parts of the Chalk, as demonstrated by the instances of \npipe flow into the Eastern Quarry.  However, while such conduits are probably responsible \nfor at least some of the heterogeneity observed, particularly among the Test Borehole \ngrouping immediately south of the Eastern Quarry, they do not seem to have sufficient lateral \npersistence to provide preferential flowpaths on the kilometre scale.  \n \nThis combined use of isotopic and trace gas indicators has provided new insights into the \nhydrogeology of an area where development pressures mean a balance must be struck \nbetween environmental amenity and water supply.  The information gained can be used to \ninform appropriate management  strategies. \n \n \nAcknowledgments   \n \nThe assistance of Blue Circle Industries (now Lafarge Cement UK) with the sampling of \nquarry fracture waters is gratefully acknowledged.
