Drikakis\nFluid Mechanics and Computational Science (FMaCS)\nSchool of Engineering, Cran\feld University\nBedfordshire, Cran\feld, MK43 0AL, UK\nAugust 24, 2011\nAbstract\nA novel multi-scale simulation method developed to describe mesoscale\nphenomena occurring in bio\ruidic devices is presented. The approach\ncombines the macro-scale modelling of the carrier \ruid and the micro-\nscale description of the transported macro-molecules or compounds.\nApplication of the approach is demonstrated through mesoscale simu-\nlations of DNA molecules. The investigated phenomena include elastic\nrelaxation of dsDNA molecules and migration of ssDNA molecules in a\nmicrochannel \row. The results of the \frst study demonstrate that the\nelastic behaviour of the DNA molecules can be captured sucessfully.\nThe second study proves that the migration of ssDNA in pressure\ndriven microchannel \rows can be explained by the hydrodynamic in-\nteraction with the carrier liquid.\n1 Introduction\nMicro- and nano\ruidic devices o\u000ber numerous advantages compared to macro-\nscale systems, including enhanced reaction control, reduced operating vol-\numes and throughput time. As a result, these devices are increasingly used\n1\nin biomedical engineering ([1, 2]) with applications including mixing [3], \fl-\ntering and separation [4] and bio-detection [5]. The ability to manipulate\ncomplex molecules with liquid \row in micro- and nano devices is required in\nmany biomedical applications, which propmts the development of modelling\ntools capable of resolving the physical processes involved.\nMicro- and nano\ruidic systems are characterised by physical phenom-\nena occuring at a range of scales. Interaction between macromolecules and\nthe molecules of the carrier liquid occur on atomistic length and time scale,\nhowever transport of macromolecules and their mechanical behaviour is de-\ntermined by the macroscopic \row \feld of the carrier liquid. Conventional\nmodelling methods are designed to describe phenomena relevant to a limited\nrange of scales. Molecular modelling techniques can capture the properties\nof a single macromolecule at timescale of several nanoseconds and are widely\nused to describe nano-scale DNA behaviour [6], molecule-molecule interac-\ntions [7] and structural changes [8]. However the computational resource re-\nquirements make molecular techniques ine\u000ecient for meso- and macroscopic\nphenomena. The motion of the liquid \row at scales of up to \u0018 10nm can be\nadequately described with the conventional continuum \ruid dynamics tech-\nniques. The challenge associated with the development of models capable\nof resolving DNA motion in \ruid \row is that of coupling the macroscopic\nmotion of the carrier \ruid with the microscopic model of the DNA molecule.\nThis aim can be accomplished by introducing a simpli\fed mechnical\nmodel of a DNA molecule. The idea behind simpli\fed mechanical models\n2\nis similar to that of coarse-graining models originating from the molecular\ndynamics studies (e.g. [9]). For example, Brownian Dynamics (BD) ap-\nproach based on mechanical representation of DNA molecules as bead-rod or\nbead-spring structures [10] has been developed to cover considerably longer\ntime scales than molecular modelling (e.g. [11]). BD has been extensively\nused to determine macroscopic properties of dilute polymer solutions [12],\nmodel dynamics of DNA molecules [13] and migration of macromolecules\n[14]. Drawbacks of the approach include the implicit treatment of the solvent\nand omitted inertial forces. These simpli\fcations can limit the applicability\nof BD, especially when for complex and unsteady carrier liquid \rows.\nAn alternative meta-modelling approach has been developed recently [15,\n16]. The approach is closely related to BD, since it relies on a mechanical\nrepresentation of macromolecules, however, the carrier liquid \row is modelled\nexplicitly using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the acceleration\nterms are kept in the equations of motion of the DNA. In this paper, the\napplication of this approach to the dsDNA relaxation process is presented\nfollowed by a study of the ssDNA migration phenomenon.\n2 Meta-modelling approach\nThe meta-modelling approach is based on the continuum level modelling of\nthe carrier liquid coupled with the motion of the mechanical bead-rod or\nbead-spring structures representing DNA molecules. The motion of the me-\n3\nchanical structures is determined by the hydrodynamic and inter-molecular\nforces acting on individual beads. Motion of the bead n with mass mn and\nposition vector rn is described by the Langevin equation\nmn\nd2rn\ndt2\n= mn\rn\n\u0000\nu(rn)\u0000 vn\n\u0001\n+ \u001en + n +'n(t); (1)\nwhere mn\rn = 6\u0019\u0011bn is the friction coe\u000ecient arising from the Stokes drag\nof a sphere with radius bn, in a \ruid with a dynamic viscosity \u0011. u(rn) is the\n\ruid velocity; vn denotes the particle velocity; \u001en represents the sum of all\nnon-hydrodynamic forces;  n incorporates additional hydrodynamic forces\nrelevant to polymer migration phenomena including the Sa\u000bman lift force\nand the Faxen correction (e.g. [17]). 'n(t) is the random Brownian force,\nmodelling the e\u000bect of the carrier liquid molecules stochastically colliding\nwith the beads and exchanging momentum. It is worth noting that bead-\nrod or bead-spring models provide an equivalent mechanical behaviour with\nrespect to elastic and transport properties. However they do not necessarily\nresolve the conformation of the macromolecule.\nGoverning equations of the incompressible carrier liquid are given by\n@u\n@t\n+ (u \u0001 r)u = \u00001\n\u001a\nrp+ \u0017\u0001u+ 1\n\u001a\nF ; (2)\nr \u0001 u = 0; (3)\nwhere \u001a, p, \u0017 and u denote density, pressure, kinematic viscosity and ve-\n4\nlocity respectively and F on the right-hand side of the momentum equation\nrepresents the force arising due to the presence of macromolecules. The forc-\ning term F is equal in magnitude and opposite in the direction to the force\nexerted by the \ruid on the macromolecule. Further details of the numerical\nimplementation of the forcing term can be found in [22].\nThe coupled system of Equations (1)-(3) is solved numerically. The \row\n\feld was calculated using the in-house \fnite volume arti\fcial compressibil-\nity solver, with inviscid \ruxes approximated using the characteristics-based\nmethod (e.g. [18, 20, 19, 21]) combined with the third order variables re-\nconstruction [18, 20]. Viscous \ruxes were computed using the second order\ncentral approximation. The integration in pseudo-time for the arti\fcial com-\npressibility formulation was performed using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta\nmethod (e.g. [18, 20]).\n3 Applications\n3.1 Modeling elastic response of dsDNA\nSmith et al. [23] performed a series of measurements to determine the elastic\nresponse of dsDNA, when subjected to external stretching forces. In order to\nrepresent this behaviour, a mechanical model of dsDNA can be constructed\nusing the bead-spring approximation. The non-hydrodynamic force in the\n5\n(a) molecular model of\ndsDNA (courtesy of M.\nLai, Cran\feld Univer-\nsity)\n(b) elastic model\nt(s)\nx(\u00b5\nm\n)\n10 20 30 40 50 60\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nExperimental\nWLC bead-springs\n(c) end-to-end distance during relaxation\nFigure 1: Dynamic simulation of a 164 kbp dsDNA molecule\nEquation (1) is then de\fned as\n\u001en = \u0000F\n\u0000\nrn\u00001(t); rn(t)\n\u0001 \u0001 e(t)n\u00001;n +\n+F\n\u0000\nrn(t); rn+1(t)\n\u0001 \u0001 e(t)n;n+1; (4)\nwhere F\n\u0000\nrn\u00001(t); rn(t)\n\u0001\nis the magnitude and e(t)n\u00001;n is the direction of the\nelastic force. Elastic forces acting on dsDNA molecules can be approximated\nby the following formula\nF =\nkBT\n\u0015p\n\u0012\n1\n4(1\u0000 x=l)2 \u0000\n1\n4\n+ x=l\n\u0013\n; (5)\n6\nsuggested by Bustamante et al. [24]. Here kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is\ntemperature and \u0015p is the persistence length of the molecule. x denotes the\nextension of a single spring and l is the fully extended length of the spring.\nTo evaluate the complete model, the experimental study of Wong et al.\n[25] has been simulated. In this study relaxation of labeled 164 kbp T2 DNA\nmolecules in a solution with viscosity \u0011 = 21:5 cP has been investigated\nunder no-\row conditions. In the simulations, a bead-spring chain model\ncontaining 53 springs has been used to represent the dsDNA molecule. The\ncoarse graining parameters were selected following the study of Underhill and\nDoyle [26]. The total mass of the molecule was uniformly distributed along\nthe beads, resulting in mn = 3:6384 \u0001 10\u000021 kg. The drag coe\u000ecient of the\nmolecule was approximated by Batchelor's formula [27], which resulted in the\nhydrodynamic bead radius of bn = 33:7 nm. The simulation results presented\nin Figure 1 are in good overall agreement with the experiment. While the\ndiscrepancy observed in the beginning of the relaxation process indicates that\nthe \ft of the elastic force given by the Equation (4) over-predicts the actual\nforce. The end-to-end distance of dsDNA obtained at later stages is well\nwithin the stochastic variation in the experiment, represented by the error\nbars.\n3.2 Simulation of DNA migration\nMigration of macromolecules across streamlines in \ruid \rows has been ob-\nserved by various researchers (e.g. [28]). The phenomenon results in the\n7\nfocusing of the macromolecule concentration \feld, which leads to decrease of\nthe near-wall molecule concentration. This process occurs on relatively long\ntime scales.\nThe modelling approach described in the previous section allows us to\ndevelop a hydrodynamic explanation of this phenomenon. The spherical\nparticles in a non-uniform \row experience a number of additional hydrody-\nnamic forces in addition to the drag force. Taking into account Sa\u000bman lift\nforce together with Faxen drag correction leads to the following expression\nfor the hydrodynamic force in Equation (1)\n n = \u0000\u0011\u0019b3n\n\u0012\n2umax\nH2\n\u0013\n+\n1:615 (2bn)\n2p\u001a\u0011 (u(rn)\u0000 vn)\u0002 !p\n!\n; (6)\nwhere umax is the maximum \row velocity, H denotes the channel height and\n! is the vorticity vector.\nMigration of single-stranded DNA molecules has been investigated in fully\ndeveloped pressure driven channel \row at Reynolds number 0:075, based on\nthe bulk velocity and channel height of 75\u0016m. Water at room temperature\nwas assumed as the carrier liquid, resulting in the dynamic viscosity and den-\nsity of 103Pas and 103kg=m3 respectively. At the inlet, 100 ssDNA molecules\nwere distributed uniformly along the height of the microchannel. The me-\nchanical behaviour of ssDNA is better represented by the bead-rod model\n(e.g. [29]).

The results demon-\nstrate that the number of molecules present in the near wall region is de-\ncreasing and the number of molecules in the channel mid-plane is increasing\nwith time, in agrement with the experimental observations.\n9\n4 Conclusions\nAn overview of a novel multi-scale simulation method developed for meso-\nscopic processes relevant to bio\ruidic applications has been presented. The\nstrength of the approach lies in the ability to incorporate both microscopic\nand macroscopic e\u000bects. The results presented for the dsDNA relaxation\nstudy validate the approach and demonstrate its capability to resolve the dy-\nnamics of elastic dsDNA behaviour in liquid. Modelling of the ssDNA motion\nin a pressure-driven microchannel \row demonstrates that the experimentally\nobserved DNA migration phenomenon can be explained by hydrodynamic\nforces acting on the macromolecules.\nFurther research is required to develop robust multiscale modelling tools.\nIn particular molecular techniques and targeted experiments are required to\nprovide information necessary to determine parameters of the equivalent me-\nchanical representation. However the results presented here indicate that\nthe modelling approach presented in this paper shows promise and can be-\ncome an essential design tool for micro and nano-\ruidics design in biomedical\nindustry.\nReferences\n[1] C.
