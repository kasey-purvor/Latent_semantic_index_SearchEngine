Both Conservative and Labour governments have used notions of participation \nand involvement in attempts to justify and implement their social policies. Yet, \ndespite a plethora of initiatives and guidance around \u2018participation\u2019 emerging from all \nlevels of government, and a substantial academic literature, there remains a major, \nand potentially damaging, lack of clarity over many aspects of participation, while the \nsecret of achieving \u2018real\u2019 participation appears to continue to remain elusive. \n \nThe policy framework \n \nDuring the 1980s and 1990s the Conservative governments generally pursued a \nconsumerist approach to participation, underpinned by their market-oriented ideology, \nthe rise of consumerism more generally, and a desire amongst professionals and the \nusers of services to see greater user involvement and empowerment in the shaping of \nservices. In practice this was reflected in market and market-type mechanisms and the \ndevelopment of new public management approaches to the delivery of public services \n(for example, Bochel and Bochel, 2004; Massey and Pyper, 2005). \n \nSince 1997, under New Labour, there have been a range of even more eclectic \ninfluences that have encouraged participatory initiatives. These have included \nLabour\u2019s acceptance of some of the new right\u2019s criticisms of the public sector, but at \nthe same time a commitment to some greater degree of democratic participation. The \ninfluence of consumerism and user groups has also remained significant. But there \nhave also been a number of new influences, linked with ideas such as inclusion, and \nwith changes to the policy process (see, for example, Bochel and Duncan, 2007). \nWhere the former is concerned, echoes of New Labour\u2019s concern with social \nexclusion and inclusion can be seen, with a desire to try to ensure that a broader range \nof voices are heard, and this has been reinforced by arguments such as those around \nsocial capital, with proponents of such views arguing that participation can bring \nbenefits to those individuals who participate, and to society more generally. Where \nthe latter is concerned, Labour\u2019s agenda for the modernisation of government has \nincluded a concern for greater \u2018inclusiveness\u2019 in policy making, both in making \nvoices heard, but also grounded in a belief that this will produce better policies, and, \nconsequently, better outcomes. However, it is also clear that for the government \n\u2018inclusive\u2019 policy making is about involving not only users, but also a whole range of \nother stakeholders and interests, including those who are responsible for the \nimplementation of policies.  \n \nThis article seeks to review the nature and purposes of participation, and in particular \nuser participation, as it has developed over recent years, highlighting many of the \ncomplexities and ambiguities that continue to bedevil participatory initiatives, \nincluding how participation is legitimated (for example in relation to the \n\u2018representativeness\u2019 of participants, methods of consultation and participation, and \nissues of power and conflict).  \n \nThe nature and purposes of participation \n \nUser participation can be defined as a form of activity shared by both governmental \nand non-governmental actors, at least some of whom are \u2018users\u2019 in the sense of being \ndirectly involved in the processes and\/or outcomes of the activity (other kinds of \nparticipation include: civil participation, where people participate in non-\ngovernmental organisations; and civic participation, where people participate in \ngovernmental decision-making bodies). We suggest that there are at least three types \nof user in this sense: \u2018policy makers\u2019, those (primarily senior politicians, officials and \nprofessionals) who have the political, organisational or professional power to \ndetermine the overall philosophy or strategic direction of the policy process; \n\u2018activists\u2019, those who lack this power but are nevertheless actively involved in the \npolicy process, even to the extent of commissioning or providing services; and what \nBang (2005) calls \u2018everyday makers\u2019, who are not actively involved in shaping or \nchanging the process but are nonetheless directly affected by it. Users of each type \ncan be governmental or non-governmental; for example, everyday makers could \ninclude junior council staff as well as ordinary residents; and activists could include \ncommitted GPs as well as community leaders. This is clearly a more \u2018inclusive\u2019 \napproach to understanding user participation than one that sees it purely in terms of \n\u2018service users\u2019, who are typically conceptualised as clients or consumers of state \nwelfare services (such as patients, students, tenants and benefit claimants). \n \nThe purposes of participation are many and varied, and unpicking the debates around \nthese is key to an understanding of participation and an ability to take the debate \nforward. Participation might be intended to improve governance, democracy, social \ncapital, education and development of individuals, policies, service implementation \nand delivery \u2013 all, or one or more of these, or something else altogether. Clarification \nof the purposes of participation is therefore crucial, and initiatives that are not clear \nabout this, or which have one or more purposes, may create confusion and undermine \ntheir ability to produce successful outcomes. \n \nIn reality, this lack of clarity extends to many of the ideas and much of the \nterminology associated with participation, including the ways in which \u2018users\u2019 are \nrepresented, and the ends for participation; all of which potentially affect the \nprospects of participation successfully impacting upon policy and practice, as well as \nposing real problems for analysis. This is true even within government documents \npromulgating participation as good practice. For example, the terms \u2018consultation\u2019 \nand \u2018participation\u2019 suggest different degrees of involvement in the decision making \nprocess (see, for example, Cabinet Office, 2002: 41), yet they are often used \ninterchangeably. This causes difficulties for those seeking to encourage and enable \n\u2018user participation\u2019, and has the potential to impact negatively on the policy process, \npolicy outcomes and the ways in which users of different types experience \nparticipation.  \n \nSimilarly, while there are now many different methods of user participation - \nexamples include involvement via written consultation on new or existing services \nand policies, becoming a member of a focus group or citizens\u2019 panel to discuss \nspecific issues, engaging in dialogue through a workshop, participating in an on-line \nchat event, helping to formulate policy options and proposals via interactive games \nand scenario planning, or taking part in visioning exercises (see, for example, Cabinet \nOffice, 2002; Bochel and Evans, 2007; Stoker, 2007), as well more consumerist \napproaches grounded in notions of individual choice, what arguably is often unclear \nare the purposes that these are intended to serve in relation to particular initiatives. \n \nNot only are there many different ways in which users might participate, but an \nequally important issue for this article is how they come to participate at all, because \nthis relates strongly to issues of representation and legitimacy, as outlined further later \nin this article, including more specifically political concerns with democracy and \npublic engagement, as discussed, for example, by Stoker (2007). There is also the \npotential for conflict between the role of elected representatives as decision makers \nand the possibilities for a shift in power frequently implied by participatory initiatives, \nleading to a further blurring of traditional representative democracy and more \nparticipatory representative approaches (Bochel, 2006; Howard and Sweeting, 2007). \n \nAnother issue is that different types of \u2018users\u2019 (policy makers, activists and everyday \nmakers) may play different participant roles, for example as elected or selected or \notherwise recognised representatives of different constituencies, as \u2018experts\u2019 in a \nparticular area, or as impartial \u2018untainted\u2019 adjudicators (Saward, 2005; see also Barnes \net al, 2007). Therefore the roles of the different types of user need to be clear. We \nmight pose a series of questions to help in thinking about this, such as: what is \nexpected from users? has this been made clear to them (including whether they have \nbeen made aware of the limits of their legitimate involvement)? what feedback will be \nprovided? what resources, if any, are available to support the process of participation? \nand how will the results of involvement inform policy or practice? (Bochel, 2006). \n \nNegotiating power and conflict in user participation  \n \nA further aspect of recent emphases on participation that lacks clarity is power \nrelationships. For example, the move towards wider, more participatory forms of \ngovernance, and greater participation in general, currently sits alongside traditional \nforms of representative government in what can sometimes be an uneasy relationship. \nThere is potential for tension between the decision making roles of elected \nrepresentatives, and the implications of participatory initiatives, incorporating \nelements of both conflict and consensus. The move towards greater participation can \nhelp to hold organisations to account, but it can also weaken the role of elected \npoliticians. \n \nArguably, the main problem here is what is known as the \u2018democratic deficit\u2019: most \nusers, and activists and everyday makers in particular, are not represented at all in any \ngiven policy process (a reflection of their relative powerlessness). Typically, decisions \nare made by elected representatives of a wider constituency (e.g. local councillors, \nMPs) or by unelected professionals and managers, perhaps in consultation with a \nsmall number of user activists. The \u2018everyday makers\u2019 (Bang, 2005), therefore, who \ntend not to participate directly, find that their indirect participation is also non-existent \n(because there is no mechanism for them to be represented in the policy process) or at \nbest ineffective (because they have a vote but it makes no clear difference to the \nresult). \n Conflicts may emerge, especially at the local level (see, for example, Newman et al, \n2004; Carr, 2007), and in relation to long standing questions about representation, \nlegitimacy, leadership, and authority (Gaventa, 2004). As much of the existing \nliterature around user participation suggests (see, for example, Newman et al, 2004; \nBarnes et al, 2007), such conflicts are often underpinned by unequal power relations \nbetween stakeholders in the participation process. \n \nSome argue that participation is more effective and empowering in situations where \npower relations are roughly equal (Fung and Wright, 2003, cited in Gaventa, 2004: \n18). Despite some evidence of user involvement impacting upon the way services are \ndelivered, the National Community Forum (Morris, 2006) points to considerable \nresearch which suggests that users, whether as individuals or in groups such as \ncommunities, are failing systematically to influence public services through new \nparticipation mechanisms (see, in particular, Barnes et al, 2007). This is even the case \nwithin New Labour flagship programmes such as Sure Start and New Deal for \nCommunities (see, for example, Perrons and Skyers, 2004; Geddes, 2006; Wright et \nal, 2007). In relation to Sure Start, Gustafsson and Driver (2005: 539) conclude that \n\u2018Parents, in effect, are powerless in the governance structures of Sure Start\u2019, as the \noverall Sure Start policy framework serves to shape the policies of local programmes \nand therefore limits the power for participants to move beyond any already \nestablished frameworks. In many ways, then, this reinforces the position of policy \nmakers, and perhaps \u2018activists\u2019, as having \u2018expert\u2019 knowledge about policy solutions. \nSimilarly, consumerist initiatives can be criticised as they risk replicating and \nreinforcing existing inequalities, while choice can be constrained by a variety of \nfactors, including who is making the choice and how, while choice for some may not \nbe choice for others (see for example, Arksey and Glendinning, 2007, on informal \ncarers, or Hilditch, 2007, on choice-based lettings in social housing). As a result of \nuser participation, however, policy makers, and for that matter activists, may no \nlonger be the only \u2018experts\u2019 in the field; the process may also inform users so that they \nact in different ways, with Gustafsson and Driver noting that Foucault\u2019s \u2018pastoral \npower\u2019 could mean that in Sure Start parents do gain power to some extent, including \nperhaps by being able to challenge the power of others. \n \nIndeed, shifts towards user involvement and participation have often been concerned \nwith a desire to encourage greater inclusion in the policy process for groups and \nindividuals whose voice and contributions have historically been marginalised (for \nexample, ethnic minorities, youth, older people) (Gaventa, 2004). Yet, for some \ncritics, it is apparent that existing structures for engaging users\u2019 views, and \nparticularly those of activists and everyday makers, within the policy process, may in \nfact exaggerate feelings of exclusion and disempowerment. For example, in a study \nexamining domestic violence survivors\u2019 forums, Hague (2005: 200) concluded that \n\u2018\u2026women\u2019s groups sometimes felt betrayed and side-lined, when their careful \ncontributions were ignored, even when the reason might have been over-work and \nexhaustion on the part of policy-makers facing too many demands and scarce \nresources\u2019. Similarly, even in cases where agreements are made in the presence of \nservice users, there are examples where decisions have been made \u2018behind closed \ndoors\u2019 (see for example, Barnes et al, 2004), or where users are perceived by officials \nas choosing \u2018\u2026the wrong battles to fight \u2013 things they can\u2019t influence\u2019 (Birchall and \nSimmons, 2004: 36-7). Hiebert and Swan (1999), for example, tell the story of an \nHIV\/AIDS user group in Canada whose funding was abruptly terminated when they \ndared to challenge the judgements of health professionals. More recently, Skidmore et \nal (2006) have provided considerable evidence to show how participation can \ndisempower communities by co-opting so-called \u2018community leaders\u2019 to the initiative, \nleaving the rest of the community behind. Such examples highlight the risk that some \nattempts at user involvement, far from challenging the marginalization and \ndisempowerment of some groups, will actually reinforce it.  \n \nThese instances further highlight the complex and fragile nature of user involvement \nand participation in current policy processes, and emphasise the need for clarity \nregarding power differentials between different stakeholders (see also Beresford and \nHoban, 2005) and honesty surrounding users\u2019 influence, including the relative power \nof \u2018policy makers\u2019, \u2018activists\u2019 and \u2018everyday makers\u2019. A recent article which draws on \nthe findings of a major review on service user participation in social care by the \nSocial Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) concludes that such \u2018difficulties with \npower relations were found to underlie the majority of identified problems with \neffective user-led change. Exclusionary structures, institutional practices and \nprofessional attitudes can affect the extent to which service users can influence \nchange\u2019 (Carr, 2007: 267-8).  \n \nThere is, of course, also the potential for conflicts within organizations that seek to \nrepresent users (Barnes et al, 2006). Such conflicts may relate to the different issues \nidentified by different groups. Indeed, research on voluntary and community sector \norganisations by Taylor et al (2004) suggests that despite the government\u2019s promotion \nof \u2018diversity\u2019, government respondents were repeatedly impatient with the number of \ndifferent voices encountered on similar issues, preferring instead to hear a unified \nvoice (cited in Gaventa, 2004: 17). \n \nIn response to such difficulties, alternative mechanisms for participation can be found \namong the abundance of writings on user involvement. Such methods, whilst not \novercoming the problems arising from unequal power relations, may at least go some \nway towards reducing inequalities and encouraging greater empowerment in the \nprocess. Here, ideas of flexibility and creativity in facilitating inclusive dialogue \nbetween users of different types are important (Carr, 2007). For example, Barnes et al \n(2006) describe a workshop event they facilitated which was designed to challenge \nfeelings of exclusion among users of services, with their informal approach intended \nto encourage the users to be \u2018\u2026active, contributing experts rather than passive \nrecipients and be able to tell their stories in a way that made sense to them and in an \nenvironment in which they felt comfortable\u2019 (Barnes et al, 2006: 335). Such \napproaches, creating conditions within which such dialogue might become routine, \nmay be appropriate to relationships between all types of users, perhaps involving co-\ngovernance, as discussed later. Amongst other things, however, this would require \nradical changes in the organisation of the professions and state organisations. \n \nEvaluating user participation \n \nAs argued earlier in this article, \u2018user participation\u2019 is taken to mean activity, focused \non policy processes, by those who are affected by such processes. Such participation \ncan be evaluated in terms of either inputs or outputs\/outcomes. It can be assessed, \nfirst, in terms of the extent and intensity of its inclusivity; and second, in terms of its \nfitness for purpose (whether interpreted internally or externally). These alternative \napproaches to evaluation lead to quite different sets of evaluation criteria. \n \nInclusivity is a democratic value: that is, in a democracy, all citizens should have the \nopportunity to participate on an equal basis. Modern political systems, however, do \nnot make it possible for most citizens to participate directly in policy making. Instead, \nthey participate indirectly, through elected representatives. The inclusivity of user \nparticipation, therefore, depends not only on how many people and how much they \nparticipate but also on how well they are represented in the policy process.  \n \nRepresentation is a major unresolved issue here. For example, an individual may \nparticipate to represent themselves, to represent the views of a group or organisation, \nor a broader group, such as users of a particular service, or people with a certain \ncharacteristic, for example, women, older people or black and ethnic minorities, on an \nelected, selected or mandated basis. These categories are not mutually exclusive. One \nway to help to address this lack of clarity, at least in more top-down initiatives, may \nbe for \u2018policy makers\u2019 or \u2018expert\u2019 users (Bang, 2005) to be clear about who they wish \nto involve and why they are selecting particular groups or individuals as opposed to \nothers, and for \u2018activists\u2019 or \u2018everyday makers\u2019 to be clear about why they are being \nasked to participate, and who they are expected to represent. Even where it is possible \nfor discussions to take place on more equal terms, similar consideration of roles may \nbe desirable, in order to ensure effective and accountable decision-making. In general, \nfor \u2018inclusive\u2019 policy making, there must be clear rules and protocols in place to \nensure that full account is taken of the diversity within and across user groups, and \nthis includes strategies to achieve equality of participation and representation in all \nstages of the policy process. \n \nThere are risks in increasing direct participation by \u2018everyday makers\u2019. Bang (2005: \n171), for example, suggests that they might act as atomised consumers, fragmenting \nand trivialising the public sphere, \u2018turning democratic debate and opinion-forming \ninto a spectacle performed by competing political celebrities from state, market and \ncivil society\u2019. Alternatively, their participation might be orchestrated by policy \nmakers for their own purposes, as appears to have happened in Mexico City (Harbers, \n2007). It is essential, therefore, to devise appropriate mechanisms to ensure more \neffective indirect participation, and this might, for example, be achieved through the \ncreation, development and support of democratically organised user groups, with as \nwide a membership base as possible (for example, the social movement organisations \non fuel poverty and sustainability discussed in Barnes et al, 2007). In spite of the \nmany drawbacks of such an organisation, our political system has so far not managed \nto produce any viable example of such a group better than a political party. \n \nWith regard to outcomes criteria, the key question is how the outcome is to be valued. \nArguably, user participation should be evaluated not only in relation to its own \nobjectives but also in relation to its social and political context. It is important, for \nexample, to question what \u2018improving services\u2019 actually means or what purpose will \nbe served by increasing human and social capital or improving governance. Also, \nparticipation that serves these purposes may not require representation \u2013 for example, \nparticipants may need to have only relevant competence or status.  \n \nImproving services, for example, could be understood as involving practices to \nincrease the well-being of those who use them, which in theory could be measured in \nterms of health, happiness, and such like (see Layard, 2005). Three key issues would \nneed to be addressed here: first, establishing if and to what extent the well-being of \nservice users is a consequence of user participation; second, identifying which users \nor groups of users successfully influence policy or practice; and third, identifying \nwhich users benefit, and to what extent, from the process. The relationship between \nuser participation and well-being is complex, for a number of reasons, including the \ndifferent types of user (policy makers, activists and everyday makers), and the lack of \ncorrelation both between participants and beneficiaries and between the degree of \nparticipation and the amount of benefit, either for an individual user or for service \nusers collectively. \n \nIncreasing human and social capital also presents difficulties of interpretation and \nmeasurement. The evidence for the effects of participation here seems overwhelming \n(see, for example, Halpern, 2005). This is hardly surprising, because participation \ninevitably develops people\u2019s skills and, by definition, user participation is highly \nlikely to increase linking social capital as it involves \u2018linking\u2019 people into policy \nprocesses. Also, increasing the quality of representation by building democratic \ngroups and organisations of users involves the creation and strengthening of bonding \nand bridging social capital. There is a risk of circularity here, in that increasing (user) \nparticipation requires the building of human and social capital, yet the purpose of the \nparticipation is to do the selfsame thing. To avoid this circularity, it is necessary to \nspecify more precisely the kind of human and social capital that user participation is \nintended to develop and the reasons for developing it. If, for example, user \nparticipation results in greater autonomy of action or increased capacity to influence \npolicy making, then this might be regarded as an outcome that could be measured by \nevaluators. \n \nImproving governance is beset by analogous problems relating to the meaning of \ngovernance and the measurement of its quality. Kooiman (2005) distinguishes three \nmodes of governance, related to three different kinds of (user) participation (or what \nKooiman calls \u2018interaction\u2019): hierarchical governance, self-governance and co-\ngovernance. Applied to the policy process, hierarchical governance is \u2018top-down\u2019 \ngovernance in which a central \u2018governator\u2019 dominates the policy process (through an \nincreasing variety of techniques: line management, contract, regulation, targeted \nfunding, programme planning, etc). Self-governance is \u2018bottom-up\u2019 governance in \nwhich actors make their own policy in their own way. Co-governance is then where \ndifferent groups of actors work co-operatively with one another, in a process of \nmutual shaping and mutual representation (see also Somerville and Haines, 2007).  \n \nParticipation in hierarchical governance commonly involves processes of consultation \nwith activists or user representatives and\/or incorporation of them into the hierarchy. \nTypically, therefore, these processes involve the development of new techniques \nwhich are simply added to the existing repertoire. In this context, \u2018improving \ngovernance\u2019 may mean only making the systems of inequality or domination more \neffective, with the autonomy of service users (everyday makers) being prevented or \nundermined and they and activists becoming complicit in their own oppression.  \n \n(User) participation in self-governance, in contrast, seems like a truism. Nevertheless, \nit draws attention to the need for users to organise themselves separately, developing \ntheir own policies, practices and forms of representation. As mentioned earlier, this is \nessential for maximising the inclusivity of participation. So self-governance is a \ncondition for effective user input into the policy process, which itself can improve \nself-governance. For example, tenant management organisations (TMOs) are self-\ngoverning, they enable activists and everyday users to participate with policy makers \nin making policy on council housing management, and such participation can serve to \nstrengthen TMO self-governance (ODPM, 2002). This does not mean, however, that \nincreasing self-governance is a legitimate aim for user participation in every case, \nbecause much depends on the specific character and content of the self-governance \nconcerned \u2013 particularly, the democratic quality of its decision-making processes \n(such as observing due process, mutual respect, and equality of voice). \n \nWhere self-governing entities based outside the policy process engage on a more or \nless equal basis with actors based inside the policy process, we have the possibility of \nco-governance. Here everyday makers and activists participate in at least two arenas \u2013 \nthat of their own movement and that of established power. They draw their strength \nand autonomy from their own organisations, which enable them (in principle) to deal \nwith the mechanisms of hierarchical governance without being subverted or \ncorrupted. Improving co-governance therefore sounds like a legitimate aim for user \nparticipation, but it is extremely difficult to achieve because hierarchy is likely to \ntrump self-governance in most cases. This argument therefore highlights the need for \nevaluation to consider the ways in which hierarchical governance can be transformed, \nparticularly through more radical forms of user participation (see, for example, the \napplication of futures methods \u2013 Platt and Cooper, 2006). \n \nConclusions \n \nThis article has sought to highlight the complex nature of \u2018user participation\u2019, in terms \nof its theoretical underpinnings and the wide variety of approaches that have been \nfollowed in seeking to put it into practice. There remains a considerable lack of \nclarity, and indeed confusion, over many aspects of user participation, and this is \noften reinforced by other factors, such as the need to undertake initiatives with limited \nresources and the limited parameters for change in policy and practice that generally \nexist. Perhaps what emerges most clearly from this discussion is the need for further \nconsideration of the various possible purposes and contexts of user participation and, \nwithin attempts to put such participation into practice, the need for clarity and \nawareness on the part of policy makers, activists and everyday makers, about their \nroles, the limits of their roles, and the boundaries of involvement. While many of the \npotential barriers to \u2018successful\u2019 participation might still remain, at least some of the \npossibilities for disappointment, alienation, unmet expectations and disappointment \nmight be reduced, and the quality of input and of outcomes increased. Beyond that, it \nappears that there is scope for greater and deeper participation for activists and \neveryday makers, but this would require a more radical approach to the policy \nprocess, potentially developing it around notions of co-governance. \n \n \nReferences \n \nArksey, H. and Glendinning, C.
