In part, this is facilitated\nby a reduction in component size, due to the use of high\nswitching frequencies and the reduced heat-sinking require-\nments, which results from their increased efficiency.\nAdditionally, resonant converters offer the possibility of\nexploiting transformer parasitics, such as the magnetising\ninductance, leakage inductance and interwinding capaci-\ntance, directly in the resonant tank circuit, thereby reducing\nthe need for discrete components. Indeed, several compo-\nnent manufacturers have recognised the commercial\npotential of resonant converters, and are producing\ndedicated resonant-converter-controller integrated circuits.\nAlthough many resonant-converter topologies have been\ninvestigated in the literature, it is the LCLC family of\nconverters that has received the most attention. Particular\nmembers of the LCLC family offer significantly superior\nopen- and short-circuit behaviour compared with second-\norder counterparts, with some also exhibiting load-inde-\npendent operating points [1, 2]. However, in contrast to\nsecond-order variants, the analysis and design of these\nthird-order converters is complicated by the requirement to\nmodel more than one useful mode of operation.\nAlthough the use of fundamental-mode-approximation\n(FMA) techniques for the analysis and design of resonant\nconverters [1\u20133] has been widespread, they suffer from a\nnumber of limitations. First, as the switching frequency\nmoves away from the resonant frequency, the tank-current\nwaveform becomes increasingly triangular, thereby invali-\ndating the sinusoidal-waveform assumption which is\nimplicit in the use of FMA. Secondly, the number of circuit\nstates that exist during a single switching cycle can change\nwith the operating condition. The LCC current-outputE-mail: m.p.foster@sheffield.ac.uk\nM.P.

Power Appl., Vol. 153, No. 4, July 2006 559\n \nconverter, for example, exhibits significant nonlinear\nbehaviour when heavily loaded [4], leaving the designer\nwith a degree of uncertainty as regards the appropriateness\nof the chosen equivalent circuit. In an attempt to address\nsuch issues, \u2018modified\u2019 FMA equivalent circuits, that more\naccurately represent the waveshape of a particular variable,\nhave been developed. In [4], for instance, an equivalent-\ncircuit model for the LCC current-output converter\noperating under heavy- and intermediate-load conditions\nwas developed, by extracting the fundamental component\nfrom an equation which described the nonsinusoidal\nparallel capacitor voltage. Other design\/analysis methodol-\nogies based on state\u2013space models have also been reported,\nalthough they generally require the solution of nonlinear\nsimultaneous equations, which often requires recourse to\nnumerical methods and\/or design charts [5, 6].\nIn this paper, five novel design-synthesis methodologies\nfor LCC voltage-output converters are presented. All the\ntechniques enable the values of the resonant-circuit\ncomponents to be determined given a specified voltage-\nconversion factor, and a further specification particular to\nthe chosen methodology. The equivalent circuit is defined\nentirely in closed form, thereby making the procedures\ndeterministic, and recourse to interpolation or complex\nnumerical solutions is not required. Further, a procedure\nfor sizing the filter capacitor is derived based on the\nequivalent-circuit model. The paper also introduces the\nconcept of confidence mapping to provide a mechanism\nfor assessing the accuracy of the results generated from a\nparticular design procedure, and give the designer a means\nof fine tuning a converter\u2019s performance. Thus, it has the\npotential to reduce the design effort significantly, particu-\nlarly during the initial phases, by identifying the viability of\na particular converter design and reducing the number of\nsimulation verification steps which are normally required.\nTo reduce the complexity of the proposed design\nmethodologies, the following assumptions are made:\n(i) All the passive components behave linearly;\n(ii) Diodes are ideal one-way switches with an on-state\nvoltage drop;\n(iii) MOSFETs are ideal switches with zero on-state\nresistance;\n(iv) All switches commutate instantaneously; and\n(v) The converter input voltage is constant.\n2 Equivalent-circuit modelling of LCC\nvoltage-output converter\nConsider the LCC voltage-output converter shown in Fig. 1\nin which the half-bridge MOSFETs T1 and T2 are switched\nin antiphase at a frequency fs, thereby effectively \u2018chopping\u2019\nthe DC link voltage Vdc to produce a square-wave input\nvoltage Vi to the resonant tank. This excites the resonant\ntank and causes current iin to flow. The output voltage Vout\nis developed from the portion of iin which flows into the\nfilter capacitor Cf when the rectifier is conducting, during\nwhich time the parallel capacitor voltage vcp is clamped to\nVout. When iin crosses zero, the rectifier turns off and vcp falls\n(or rises) from Vout (\u0001Vout) with a negative (positive) slope.\nWhen vcp \u00bc \u0001Vout, the rectifier commutates and clamps vcp\nat \u0001Vout. The rate at which vcp charges\/discharges is\ndetermined by the values of Cp and RL.\nThe behaviour of the LCC converter is similar to that of\nthe classical series-resonant converter [1, 3], with the\nexception that the rate-of-change of voltage at the input\nto the bridge rectifier is limited by the presence of Cp.\nMoreover, it can be shown [6\u20139] that the interaction\nbetween Cp and Cf via the rectifier can produce a voltage\ngain greater than unity, a feature which is not possible with\na classical second-order series converter.\nAlthough the series-resonant converter is readily analysed\nusing FMA by replacing Vdc by an equivalent sinusoidal\nvoltage and representing the load and rectifier by an\nequivalent resistor Re, in practice this is not appropriate for\nthe LCC voltage-output-converter variant since vcp cannot\nbe assumed to have either a square or sinusoidal waveform,\nowing to the dv\/dt-limiting effect of Cp. Consequently,\na describing function is used to model vcp as a complex\nvoltage source, that is ultimately transformed into an\n\u2018equivalent\u2019 complex impedance. This paper follows the\napproaches taken in [7, 8], with the exception that\nequivalent-circuit passive components are derived explicitly\nand the effect of the rectifier on-state voltage is considered.\nThe proposed analysis begins by assuming that the tank-\ncurrent waveform is sinusoidal, i.e.\niin \u00bc I^in sin\u00f0ost\u00de \u00f01\u00de\nwhere I^in is the peak value of iLs and os \u00bc 2pfs is the\nangular switching frequency. This is justified since the\nfiltering action of the tank circuit removes high-order\nharmonics, effectively forcing the input current to be a\nsinusoid.\nWhile the rectifier is conducting, the parallel capacitor\nvoltage is clamped to the output voltage, and is described by\nvcp \u00bc n\u00f0Vout \u00fe kVd\u00desgn\u00f0iLs\u00de \u00f02\u00de\nwhere k\u00bc 1 for a half-bridge rectifier or k\u00bc 2 for a full-\nbridge rectifier.\nFrom Fig. 1b, the rectifier switches off when the\nresonant-circuit current, iin, crosses zero, at which time iin\nstarts to charge Cp.

A\nmore detailed description of the equivalent-circuit model is\ngiven in [9].\n3 Design methodologies\nThis Section describes five novel design methodologies\nbased on the equivalent-circuit model presented. In\naddition, a procedure for incorporating the magnetising\ninductance of a transformer within the design of a\nconverter, along with a procedure for filter capacitor sizing,\nare also discussed.\nThe first methodology (designated DM1) bases the\ndesign on standard AC-circuit parameters (Q and o0) and\nthe rectifier nonconduction angle y1. The second methodol-\nogy (DM2) employs the definition of the switch power\nfactor, whilst the remaining methods (DM3\u20135) allow some\nresonant-circuit values to be specified during the design\nprocess, thereby allowing the designer to use standard \u2018off-\nthe-shelf\u2019 components.\nAs with most design techniques, a standard set of core-\nspecification parameters is required, summarised in Table 1.\n3.1 Design method 1 (DM1): specified\nrectifier nonconduction angle y1\nIn this method, all the resonant-circuit components (i.e.\nLs, Cs and Cp) of the converter are determined for a\nspecific rectifier nonconduction angle y1, a given operating\nfrequency fs and a combined equivalent resonant frequency\nf0. Unlike the previously published techniques presented in\n[6, 7], the resonant-circuit-capacitor ratio (Cp\/Cs) is not\nrequired, thereby making the interpretation of the design\nmore tangible. However, before presenting the design\nalgorithm in detail, it is instructive to consider how\nthe behaviour of the converter is influenced by these\nparameters.\nAnalysis: In a similar manner to the normalising procedure\ndescribed in [3], the parameters Q, o0 and on can be used\nto derive an expression for the voltage-conversion ratio\nMv \u00bc Vo=Vdc, where\nQ \u00bc 1\no0CtotRZ\n\u00bc o0Ls\nRZ\n; o0 \u00bc 1\u00f0LsCtot\u00de\np ; on \u00bc oso0\n\u00f015\u00de\nSpecifically, from [3],Mv is obtained by combining (14) and\n(7)Fneglecting Vd, substituting into (15) and rearranging\nusing (12), to give:\nMv \u00bc VoutVdc \u00bc\n1\nnf1\u00fe cos\u00f0y1\u00deg\n1\n1\u00fe Q2 on \u0001 1on\n\u0001 \u0002\u0003 \u00042s\n\u00f016\u00de\nBy inspection, it can be seen that (16) has a similar form to\nthe standard series-resonant-converter FMA model [1, 3],\nwith the exception that the gain is modified by the term\n1=\u00bdnf1\u00fe cos\u00f0y1\u00deg\u0004, which, importantly, shows the poten-\ntial for having a voltage gain greater than unity, as will be\nevident from Fig. 3. Moreover, from Fig. 3, it can be seen\nthat the voltage gain increases with the rectifier nonconduc-\ntion angle. This is expected since, when the rectifier is not\nconducting, Cp is being charged and can therefore support a\ngreater voltage if charged for longer. Furthermore, Fig. 3\nshows that, while the magnitude of the voltage gain at\nresonance is unaffected by theQ-factor, the bandwidth, and\nhence the rate at which the voltage gain changes with\nfrequency, is significantly affected. This imposes restrictions\non the maximum value of Q that can be employed in terms\nof the converter controllability and sensitivity to component\ntolerances.\nAlthough Fig. 3 provides useful information regarding\nthe voltage transfer and control characteristics of an LCC\nconverter, the designer is invariably also required to\noptimise converter efficiency. However, rather than entering\ninto a detailed discussion about the resonant tank,\ntransformer and rectifier efficiencies (details of which can\nbe found elsewhere [1]), the ratio of the resonant-circuit\ncurrent to the output currentMi will be used as a metric for\ndesign. Setting Vd\u00bc 0 in (7), and substituting Vout \u00bc IoutRL,\nusing RMS quantities and rearranging, gives\nMi \u00bc I^in rmsIout \u00bc\np\n2\np\nnf1\u00fe cos\u00f0y1\u00deg\n\u00f017\u00de\nAgain, by ignoring the transformer turns ratio, it can be\nseen that Mi is dependent only on y1. From Fig. 4, it can\nclearly be seen that the resonant-circuit current increases\nsignificantly for y14901. Further, from Fig. 3, it can be seen\nthat, to achieve a voltage gain greater than unity at\nresonance, y14901.\nTo summarise, Q should be chosen to reduce problems\nassociated with component-tolerance sensitivity and con-\ntrollability issues, and y1 should be chosen to reduce the\ncirculating current in the tank circuit, thereby reducing\nconduction losses in the switches and inductor, and to\nminimise voltage\/current stresses on individual components.\nConsequently, for a step-down converter, y1o901, whilst\nfor step-up operation, the designer must trade off the effects\nof an increase in transformer turns ratio with circulating-\ncurrent levels. A suitable value for y1, having been chosen,\ntogether with nominal values for os and o0, specific\ncomponent values can be determined.\nDesign procedure: The load resistance is calculated from\nRL \u00bc VoutIout \u00f018\u00de\nwhere Iout \u00bc Pout=Vout. A value for Cp is then obtained\nby solving (6) for I^in, and substituting into (5).

The total input\npower is then obtained from\nPin \u00bc Pout \u00fe Ploss \u00f026\u00de\nBy replacing Pout with Pin in (24), a revised value for I^in is\nobtained as\nI^in \u00bc pPinVdcPf \u00f027\u00de\nThe improved estimate of I^in is then substituted into (25),\nand the refinement process is repeated. Again, it has been\nshown that a maximum of three iterations is usually\nsufficient to obtain results which are accurate to three\nsignificant figures.\nRZ and CZ are found from (9), and Cp is obtained by\nrearranging (6):\nCp \u00bc I^inosVb \u0001\npIout\n2nosVb\n\u00f028\u00de\nCs is obtained by specifying the maximum allowable voltage\nstress V^cs and the peak tank current:\nCs \u00bc I^in\nosV^Cs\n\u00f029\u00de\ngiving the total equivalent-circuit capacitance:\nCtot \u00bc CsCZCs \u00fe CZ \u00f030\u00de\nLs is then found from (23).\n3.3 Design method 3 (DM3): specified Cp\nThe remaining design methodologies are particularly useful if\nthe designer is constrained in the choice of component values.\nIn this particular case, Ls and Cs are calculated when the\nvalue of Cp is fixed. The method is based on DM1 in which\nthe peak input current was used to determine Ls and Cs.\nInitially, RL is calculated from (18) and the peak input\ncurrent I^in is found by rearranging (6) and inserting values\nfor the switching frequency and Cp:\nI^in \u00bc pIout \u00fe 2nVbosCp\n2n\n\u00f031\u00de\nValues of Ls and Cs are then determined from (21)\u2013(23).\n3.4 Design method 4 (DM4): specified Ls\nTo begin with, a value of Cp is selected based on either\nDM1 or DM2; Cs is then readily determined from Ls, os\nand o0:\nMethod 1: Specified diode non-conduction angle\nUsing y1, Cp is obtained directly from (19).\nMethod 2: Specified switch power factor\nThe peak input current is found by solving (25)\u2013(27)\niteratively. Once I^in has converged, Cp is calculated using\n(31).\nCp having been determined the total circuit capacitance is\ngiven by:\nCtot \u00bc 1o20Ls\n\u00f032\u00de\nfrom which Cs is found by substituting (9) into (22).\n3.5 Design method 5 (DM5): specified Cs\nand Cp\nIn this method, a value of Ls is sought from the specification\nof Cp, Cs, os and o0 by employing (25)\u2013(27) to determine\nthe input current in an iterative manner. Subsequently, (9) is\nused to calculate the equivalent components RZ and CZ. The\ntotal circuit capacitance is then deduced from (30) and,\nfinally, the required value of Ls is determined from (32).\nAlthough a designer may elect to use any of the foregoing\ndesign methodologies to determine the tank components for\na specific resonant converter, certain methodologies lend\nthemselves to particular applications. Specifically, metho-\ndology DM1 is appropriate when attempting to minimise\nthe EMI generated by a converter, since the rectifier\nnonconduction angle y1 determines the noise level which is\ngenerated by the rectifier. For small values of y1, the\nwaveform of vCp resembles a square wave, and therefore has\na large harmonic content. However, for large values of y1,\nvCp tends to a sinusoid with a much lower harmonic\ncontent. Thus, a designer can vary y1 so as to minimise\nEMI. Methodology DM2 is more appropriate when\nefficiency is a key consideration, since the procedure\nexplicitly accounts for the power losses associated with the\nrectifier diodes, the MOSFET on-state resistance and other\nparasitic resistances which are present in the tank circuit\nat the design stage. This methodology also allows the\nmaximum voltage across Cs to be specified during the\ndesign process. Design methodologies DM3\u2013DM5 would\nbe employed when a designer is required to use \u2018off-the-\nshelf\u2019 circuit components.\n3.6 Inclusion of transformer parasitics\nAlthough an LCC converter can be designed to provide a\nvoltage-boost capability, the requirement for a significant\nstep-up voltage conversion will often require the incorpora-\ntion of a transformer and, from a commercial perspective,\nthe use of an isolation transformer is often required for\nreasons of safety. The effects of transformer magnetising\ninductance Lm can be included in a design by modifying\ntank-circuit-current calculation. This is accomplished by:\n(i) Initially, neglect Lm and calculate an initial value, I^in initial,\nof I^in from (20), (24) or (31), depending on the design\nmethodology.\n(ii) Using I^in, determine values for the equivalent compo-\nnents RZ and CZ using (9).\n(iii) Calculate the fundamental component of vcp, from\nvcp 1 \u00bc I^in\n\b\nRZ \u00fe 1sCZ\n\t\n, where s-jos.\n(iv) Determine the current drawn by Lm, from ILm \u00bc vcp 1josLM .\n(v) Calculate a revised value I^in new for the input current,\nfrom I^in new \u00bc I^in initial \u00fe I^Lm.\n(vi) Determine the resonant-circuit components, as before,\nusing I^in new.\n564 IEE Proc.-Electr.

A suitable value for Cf is calculated by\nconsidering the charge which flows into Cf and the\ncorresponding voltage rise over a specific time interval.\nFrom the example waveforms shown in Fig. 5, it can be\nseen that, during the rectifier conduction period, the current\nwhich flows into Cf is the difference between the rectifier\ninput and output currents.\nConsidering the period during which current is replenish-\ning the charge on Cf, then\nQCf \u00bc\nZ d2\nd1\niCf dt \u00bc\nZ d2\nd1\nfnI^in sin\u00f0ost\u00de \u0001 Ioutgdt \u00f033\u00de\nwhere d2 is the time at which iCf becomes zero. d2 is found\nfrom the solution of:\niCf \u00bc nI^in sin\u00f0ost\u00de \u0001 Iout \u00bc 0\nTherefore\nd2 \u00bc 1os p\u0001 sin\n\u00011 Iout\nnI^in\n\u0001 \u0002\u0003 \u0004\n\u00f034\u00de\nDuring this period Vout increases by an amount vrip, which\nprovides a further expression for the charge flowing into Cf:\nQCf \u00bc Cf vrip \u00bc Cf aVout \u00f035\u00de\nThe minimum value of Cf which is required to limit vrip to a\nspecified level a is found by equating (33) and (35), and\nrearranging to give\nCf4\nnI^in\naVoutos\nfcos\u00f0osd1\u00de \u0001 cos\u00f0osd2\u00deg \u0001 1aRL \u00f0d2 \u0001 d1\u00de\n\u00f036\u00de\nIf VoutcVd, (36) reduces to\nCf4\n1\n2aRLos\n\u00f0g2 \u0001 4\u00dep \u0001 g\u0006 \u00fe 2 cos\u00011 g\u0001 4RLosCP\ng\n\u0001 \u0002\u0003\n\u00fe sin\u00011 2\ng\n\u0001 \u0002\u0004\u0007\n\u00f037\u00de\n3.8 Experimental verification\nTo demonstrate the validity of the proposed design\nmethodologies, a 25V-input, 35V-output, 22W experi-\nmental converter was designed to meet the specification\noutlined in Table 2 using DM4. The component values for\nthe remaining resonant-circuit components were deter-\nmined, using DM4, as Cp\u00bc 89nF, Cs\u00bc 224nF while the\nvalue for Cp was realised by paralleling four 22nF\ncapacitors to give 87nF measured and the value for Cs\ncreated from a 220nF capacitor was connected in parallel\nwith two 2.2nF capacitors giving 224nF measured.\nOperating as specified (i.e. with fs\u00bc 150kHz), the\nconverter had an output voltage of 33.6V which was within\n5% of the specification. Figure 6 shows the time-domain\nwaveforms of the input voltage to the tank (Vi) and the\nparallel capacitor voltage (vCp). Inspection of Fig. 6 shows\nthe diode nonconduction period y1 to be B1231, which is\nclose to the desired 1201.\n4 Accuracy bounds\nClassically, all FMA-based design methodologies assume\nthat voltage and current waveforms can readily be\napproximated to sinusoids or square waves to simplify\ncircuit analysis. For the analysis described in this paper, the\nresonant circuit is assumed to respond only to the\nfundamental component of the input-voltage waveform\n(because of the filtering attributes of the tank) and a\nsinusoidal current is therefore assumed to flow in the\nresonant circuit. However, for switching frequencies much\nhigher than the resonant frequency (and for particular load\nranges), the tank current becomes distorted, tending to a\ntriangular waveshape, and thereby contravenes the FMA\nsinusoidal assumption. Consequently, there exists only a\nsubset of converter parameters, obtained from FMA\nresults, that provide realisable converters having the\nexpected performance characteristics (see the account given\n[1], for instance).\n19.536 19.5365 19.537 19.5375 19.538 19.5385 19.539 19.5395\n\u221240\n\u221220\n0\n20\n40\ntime, ms\n\u22121.0\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1.0\nvo\nlta\nge\n, V\nVR\nICf\niR\nt  =  \u00021 t  =  \u00022\nIout\ncu\nrr\ne\nn\nt, \nA\nFig. 5 Voltage and current waveforms for filter capacitor\nTable 2: Prototype converter parameters\nParameter Vdc\n(V)\nVout\n(V)\nPout\n(W)\nLs\n(mH)\nfs\n(kHz)\nf0s\n(kHz)\nQ y1\n(deg)\nn\nValue 25 35 22 18.4 150 136 5.5 120 1\n\u22128 \u22126 \u22124 0 2 4\n\u221250\n\u221240\n\u221230\n\u221220\n\u221210\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\ntime, \u00b5s\nvo\nlta\nge\n, V\nV\nv\n\u22122\ni\ncp\n\u00031\nFig. 6 Voltage waveforms for prototype 22WLCC voltage-output\nconverter\nIEE Proc.-Electr.

The ranges are\nsummarised in Table 3. From the comparison of results,\nerrors maps are generated to provide an indication of the\nexpected accuracy of a specific converter design. Justifica-\ntion for using the nonlinear-state-variable model as a\nbenchmark metric is that no restrictions regarding the\ncircuit-voltage\/current waveshapes or the interaction be-\ntween the output filter, rectifier and tank, are present, and it\nis therefore not constrained by underlying assumptions of\nFMA.\nBy appropriate manipulation of the resulting data,\nso-called \u20182-D confidence maps\u2019 that show the impact of\neach design parameter on the \u2018confidence\u2019 of a particular\nconverter design giving the expected performance, are\ngenerated. Since the parameters are applied to the\nequivalent-circuit model presented in Section 2, the resulting\nconfidence maps can be employed generically. In this case,\nthe data are presented in a manner that can be applied\niteratively in conjunction with design procedure DM1; see\nFigs. 7\u20139. Although it is recognised that this type of\nstatistical analysis only indicates relative trends, the body\nof evidence suggests that clearly defined regions of\nparameter ranges exist where the designer can have a high\n\u2018confidence\u2019 in realising expected performance from a\nparticular design procedure. For use with DM1, in this\nexample, the diode voltage drop is assumed constant,\n(0.45V) in each case. Note that the normalised parameters\nthat have been selected in this case are among many that\ncould have been chosen, including those relating to the\nratios Cp\/Cs and RL\/Zo, among others.\nThe procedure for generating the confidence maps is\nsummarised below:\n(i) Since, Qs \u00bc f\u00f0p2=8RL\u00de \u00f0Ls=Cs\u00de\np g \u00bc Z0=RL, RL is calcu-\nlated.\n(ii) Since oos \u00bc 1= \u00f0Ls=Cs\u00de\np\n, Cs is calculated from,\nCs \u00bc 1=o0sZ0.\n(iii) Using A\u00bcCp\/Cs, Cp is calculated from Cp \u00bc ACs.\n(iv) Finally, Ls is determined from Ls \u00bc Z20Cs.\nThe output-filter capacitor for each converter design is\nselected to limit the ripple on the output voltage to 1%.\nFinally, the nonlinear-converter model is simulated in the\ntime domain for 10\u0003CfRL seconds to allow sufficient time\nto achieve steady-state operation.\nTable 3: Confidence-map-parameter ranges\nParameter Vdc (V) Qs Cp\/Cs Z0 f0s (kHz) fs Vd (V)\nValue 1\u2013100 1\u201310 0.01\u2013100 0.01\u2013100 100 (1\u20132)\u0003 fr 0.45\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\nQ-factor\n \u03b8 1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\ne\nrr\no\nr,\n %\nFig. 7 Output voltage prediction error as a function of y1 and Q-\nfactor\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\nQ-factor\n \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\u03c9\nn\ne\nrr\no\nr,\n %\nFig. 8 Output voltage prediction error as a function of on and\nQ-factor\n0.8 1.2 1. 1.6 1.8 2.0\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\ne\nrr\no\nr,\n %\n1.0 4\n1.0\n\u03c9n\nM\nv\nFig. 9 Output voltage prediction error as a function of Mv and on\n566 IEE Proc.-Electr. Power Appl., Vol. 153, No. 4, July 2006\n \nThe variable space on a confidence map is divided into a\ngrid with each \u2018pixel\u2019 representing the level of prediction\nerror ( from 0 to 10%), the pixel value being determined by\nthe average \u2018error\u2019 within each element of the grid. The\nprediction error is calculated from\nVerror \u00bc Vout \u0001 Vout SSVout SS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0003 100% \u00f038\u00de\nwhere Vout and Vout_ss are the output voltages obtained\nfrom the equivalent-circuit model and the state-variable\nmodel, respectively.\nFigure 7 shows the percentage error between the\nreference state-variable model and the equivalent-circuit\nmodel as a function of the rectifier nonconduction angle y1\nand the equivalent circuit Q-factor. It can be seen that there\nexists a definite area, denoted by the dark regions, in which\nthe equivalent-circuit-model predictions become inaccurate.\nWith reference to Fig. 7, to ensure that accurate design\npredictions can be made using the FMA-based design\nmethodologies, values of Q44 and y1o1201 should be\nchosen. However, limiting the rectifier nonconduction angle\ny1o1201 also restricts the maximum voltage gain of the\nconverter to be less than 2 (see Fig. 3).\nFigure 8 shows the prediction error as a function of the\nratio of the switching frequency and the \u2018real\u2019 resonant\nfrequency, denoted by on, and the equivalent circuit\nQ-factor. To have high confidence in realising a converter\nwith the required attributes, it is evident that it should\nbe designed to exhibit a relatively high Q-factor and,\ncorrespondingly, should be switched close to the resonant\nfrequency. This conforms to intuitive expectations, since\nhighQ-factor tank circuits provide low-distortion sinusoidal\ntank currents near resonance. However, as discussed\npreviously, the designer must trade the effects of employing\na high Q-factor against the effects on controllability and\ncomponent sensitivity. Figure 9 shows the design confidence\nas a function of the voltage-conversion ratio Mv and the\nQ-factor, and reinforces these findings, since, for instance,\nconfidence is highest for converter designs having Mv41\nand 1oono1.1, with the performance of most being within\n1% of that predicted from state-variable simulations, as a\nconsequence of the improved filtering of the excitation-\nvoltage harmonics. Moreover, for converter designs requir-\ning 0.5oMvo1, the results suggest that on should beo1.3,\nand, for gains less that 0.5, higher values of on should be\nchosen to ensure reasonable confidence in realising the\nexpected converter performance.\nAlthough only a small sample of the possible error\/\nconfidence mappings have been presented (other key\nvariants include confidence maps as functions ofMv against\ny1 and y1 against on), it is apparent that they enable\nparameter boundaries to be viewed readily, thereby\nrestricting the design space. Moreover, although confidence\nmaps require significant computational effort to generate,\nultimately, they are generic, and can be used as an integral\npart of an interactive design tool. In practice, this is\nachieved by simultaneously placing a marker on each map\nat intercepts which correspond to the converter design\nparameters. The underlying value on the confidence maps\nthen indicates the prediction accuracy. A designer would\nthen interactively modify the converter design parameters\nso as to achieve a design that satisfied the specification to\nthe required degree of confidence. By way of example, a\nconverter design whose parameters are Ls\u00bc 47mH,\nCs\u00bc 22nF,Cp\u00bc 33nF, fs\u00bc 190kHz,Vdc\u00bc 48V, RL\u00bc 70O\nand Vd\u00bc 0.45V is superimposed on the confidence maps in\nFigs. 7\u20139, from which it can be inferred that this particular\ndesign would have an estimated prediction error of approxi-\nmately 5%. This figure is consistent with the predicted\noutput voltage from the equivalent-circuit and state-variable\nmodels, being Vout\u00bc 63.3V and Vout_ss\u00bc 65.9V, respec-\ntively, which correspond to an error of 4%.\n5 Conclusions\nThe paper has presented new approaches for designing\nLCC voltage-output resonant converters. Specifically, five\nmethodologies for determining the values of the resonant-\ncircuit components, employing various key performance\nand circuit parameters, including the diode nonconduction\nangle and the switch power factor, have been investigated.\nPractical results from a prototype converter have demon-\nstrated the accuracy of the proposed design methodologies.\nIn addition, techniques to account for the effect of the\ntransformer magnetising inductance on the circuit design,\nand for sizing the filter capacitor, based on an equivalent-\ncircuit model, have been proposed.\nThe paper has also applied the concept of error mapping.\nBy simulating over 250000 LCC converter designs over a\nconstrained parameter space, maps of prediction accuracy\nagainst design variables have been presented, and their use\nas an integral part of an interactive design tool has been\ndiscussed. Note that, although only a limited number of\nconfidence maps have been included, as a demonstration of\nprinciple, ultimately, their generation and use is generic to a\nwider parameter space, and they can be derived for all other\nresonant converter variants.\n6 References\n1 Kazimierczuk, M.K., and Czarkowski, D.: \u2018Resonant power con-\nverters\u2019 ( John Wiley and Sons, 1995)\n2 Steigerwald, R.L.: \u2018A comparison of half-bridge resonant converter\ntopologies\u2019, IEEE Trans.
