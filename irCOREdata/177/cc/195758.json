The aim \nof this study was to determine whether MS1 induces cellular hypertrophy and protects \nagainst apoptosis. Over-expressed MS1 co-localised with actin in H9c2 cells and altered \nexpression of genes of the myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)\/serum response \nfactor (SRF) transcriptional pathways and in addition the apoptosis repressor with caspase \nrecruitment domain (Nol3) gene. The size of cells over-expressing MS1 was significantly \nincreased by 55% and over-expression of MS1 dramatically inhibited staurosporine-\ninduced apoptosis by 89%. These findings suggest the involvement of MS1 in cellular \nhypertrophy and protection against apoptosis. \n \n \nKeywords:  MS1, hypertrophy, apoptosis, NOL3, MRTFs, SRF \n3 \n \n1. Introduction \n \nLeft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an adaptation of the heart in response to an \nincreased workload, stress or injury [1]. Initially this adaptation of the heart is beneficial \nbut sustained cardiac hypertrophy is associated with decompensation and heart failure, \npartly due to cell death caused by apoptosis [2]. Many signalling pathways have been \nshown to regulate hypertrophy but the molecular controllers that sense pressure overload \nand initiate hypertrophy are unclear. To better understand the initial molecular mechanisms \nthat lead to pressure-induced LVH, we have identified and characterised a novel gene, \ndesignated myocyte stress 1 [MS1; also known as STARS (striated muscle activator of Rho \nsignalling) and ABRA (actin-binding Rho activating protein)], which is up-regulated within \none hour in the left ventricle following aortic banding in the rat with a peak expression well \nbefore any detectable increase in LV mass [3,4]. This suggests a possible role for MS1 in \nthe initial signalling of the hypertrophic response. Ms1 is also expressed during embryonic \ncardiac development, is restricted to striated muscle and is transiently up-regulated during \nischaemia-reperfusion in vitro [4,5], which suggests that MS1 may play a more widespread \nrole in cardiac development and physiology. \n \nThe mouse homologue of ms1 termed STARS was shown to be a sarcomeric actin-\nbinding protein which stimulates serum response factor (SRF)-dependent transcription by \ninducing the nuclear accumulation of the SRF co-factors, myocardin-related transcription \nfactors (MRTFs) MRTF-A and MRTF-B through a mechanism dependent on RhoA and \n4 \n \nactin polymerisation [5,6]. Experiments using a cell line that expresses dominant negative \nMRTF-A identified genes that were MRTF-dependent where some were known SRF target \ngenes [7]. Many of the MRTF-dependent genes have been associated with cardiac \nhypertrophy [8,9] and cell survival [10,11]; therefore, it is conceivable that these MRTF-\ndependent genes are putative targets of MS1. Here, we have investigated the role of MS1 in \ncellular hypertrophy and survival and report that MS1 over-expression increases cell size \nand protects against apoptosis in vitro.   \n \n2. Materials and Methods \n \n2.1. Cell Size and Cell Proliferation measurements \n \nFollowing transfection for 72 hours, H9c2 cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS and \nthen cells were re-suspended in 1 ml PBSA (PBS containing 0.03% (w\/v) Sodium Azide \nand 0.2% (w\/v) BSA). Viable cells were counted and adjusted to 1  10\n5 \ncells\/100 l \nPBSA. Cells were then fixed and permeabilised using a Leucoperm kit (Serotec). During \npermeabilisation mouse anti c-Myc FITC antibody (Serotec) was added at 1:10 dilution in \nPBS and left for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The c-Myc FITC fluorescence \nof individual transfected cells and the size of cells (forward scatter) were measured using a \nBeckman Coulter Epics XL MCL flow cytometer and System II software.  \n \n5 \n \nCell proliferation was examined 72 hours after transfection by direct cell counting and \nflow cytometry (see Supplementary data for details).  \n \n2.2. Measurement of apoptosis (DNA fragmentation) \n \nInitial studies looked at the effects of staurosporine on H9c2 cells. Cells were treated \nwith various concentrations of staurosporine (5 nM - 25 nM) for 24 hours and stained with \nVybrant DyeCycle Violet Stain (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The \npercentage of apoptotic cells (sub-G1) were measured using a DakoCytomation CyAn ADP \nflow cytometer and analysed using the Summit v4.3 software.   \n \nFollowing transfection for 24 hours, H9c2 cells were treated with 5 nM staurosporine \n(Sigma) for 24 hours. Cells were then collected, labelled with mouse anti c-Myc FITC \nantibody to detect transfected cells and stained with the Vybrant DyeCycle Violet stain \n(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.   \n \nMethods for Myc-MS1 expression plasmid, Cell culture and tranfection, \nImmunofluorescence Microscopy, Real-time and Semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and Western \nblotting, see Supplementary data for details. \n \n2.3. Statistical analysis \n6 \n \n \nDifferences between sets of data were compared using Student\u2019s t-test.  A P value < 0.05 \nwas considered to be statistically significant. \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1. Altered expression of hypertrophic and cell survival genes in H9c2 cells over-\nexpressing MS1 \n \nThe MS1 expression vector over-expressed ms1 mRNA and MS1 protein in H9c2 cells \nand in cells over-expressing MS1 the MS1 signal colocalised with actin (see \nSupplementary data for details). \n \nOver-expression of MS1 significantly induced the known MRTF-dependent genes LIF \nand IL-6 and the known MRTF-SRF target genes adrenomedullin, jun-B, and fra-1 (Fig. 1).  \nLIF and IL-6 were up-regulated by 2.5-fold (P < 0.01) and 5.9-fold (P < 0.001), \nrespectively. A significant induction of 1.6-fold was observed for adrenomedullin (P < \n0.05).  Jun-B and fra-1 were increased 2.3-fold (P < 0.01) and 2.1-fold (P < 0.01), \nrespectively. In addition, genes that have been associated with cardiac hypertrophy such as \ncardiac \u03b1-actin and BNP were also up-regulated in H9c2 cells over-expressing MS1 by 2.3-\nfold (P < 0.01) and 4.5-fold (P < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 1). \n7 \n \n \nIt is well established that apoptosis accounts for cardiac cell death during \nischaemia\/reoxygenation, hypertension, and in maladaptive hypertrophy [12], disease states \nwhich induces cardiac ms1 expression. The BCL-2 family proteins play a central role in \nregulating apoptosis in the heart [2,13], therefore we measured the expression of two pro-\nsurvival factors (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) in H9c2 cells over-expressed with MS1 but found no \nchange in their mRNA expression (data not shown). Another factor of interest is Nol3 \n(Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain), an apoptosis repressor gene \nexpressed predominantly in striated muscle [14] and has been shown to inhibit \nstaurosporine-induced apoptosis [15].  Over-expression of MS1 increased Nol3 mRNA \nabundance in H9c2 cells by 2.2-fold (P < 0.05).  \n \n3.2. MS1 over-expression in vitro results in cellular hypertrophy \n \nWithin the population of cells transfected with the Myc-MS1 expression plasmid, on \naverage 13.1\u00b10.5% of cells over-expressed MS1. In each experiment 10,000 cells were \nanalysed by flow cytometry and therefore ~1300 quantified cells over-expressed MS1. The \nsize of cells over-expressing MS1 was significantly increased by 46.6\u00b16.7% (P < 0.01) \nwhen compared to the untransfected portion of cells (Fig. 2). Similarly, they were \nsignificantly larger by 54.5\u00b18.5% (P < 0.01) then cells exposed to empty vector control.   \n \n8 \n \nNeither the transfection procedure nor the over-expression of MS1 affected cell \nproliferation. This was measured by direct cell counting and flow-cytometry, which showed \nno difference in the proportion of cells over-expressing MS1 in either S phase or the G2\/M \nphase of the cell cycle when compared to the untransfected portion of cells or cells exposed \nto empty vector control (data not shown). \n \n3.3. MS1 over-expression in vitro protects against staurosporine-induced apoptotic cell \ndeath \n \nWithin the population of cells exposed to the Myc-MS1 expression plasmid, 1.6 0.5% \nof the untransfected portion of cells showed evidence of apoptosis under basal conditions. \nThis proportion was similar (2.1 0.7%) in cells exposed to empty vector. However, in MS1 \nexpressing cells, the proportion of apoptotic cells was significantly lower (0.7 0.3%) \ncompared to the untransfected portion of cells or cells exposed to empty vector (P < 0.05) \n(Fig. 3). Treatment with a sub-maximal concentration of 5 nM staurosporine for 24 hours \n(Supplementary data) markedly increased the percentage of apoptotic untransfected portion \nof cells exposed to the Myc-MS1 plasmid to 29.0 2.9% (P < 0.001 compared with basal \nlevel). This level of increase was similar in cells exposed to empty vector (32.4 3.8%, P = \n0.23). However, in MS1 transfected cells, while there was a significant increase in \napoptotic cells after 5 nM staurosporine for 24 hours (3.5 1.0%, P < 0.05 compared with \nbasal level), the increase was markedly attenuated (P < 0.001) compared with the empty \nvector exposed cells or the untransfected cells. The attenuation in apoptosis compared with \n9 \n \nthe empty vector exposed cells was ~89%. These results suggest that MS1 over-expression \naffects basal apoptosis and largely prevents staurosporine-induced apoptotic cell death.   \n \n4. Discussion \nPrevious studies have shown that cardiac ms1 is over-expressed during the development \nof LVH in experimental animal models [4,16]. More recently, ms1 expression has also been \nshown to parallel the development and regression of skeletal muscle hypertrophy in humans \n[17]. Consistent with these observations, our present in vitro finding that increased MS1 \nlevels results in an increase in cell size, provides further evidence of its role in striated \nmuscle hypertrophy. Interestingly, we found no evidence that increased MS1 levels \naffected cell proliferation suggesting that its effects are restricted to causing hypertrophy \nrather than hyperplasia. \n \nHere, we confirmed that MS1 associates with the actin cytoskeleton and causes the over-\nexpression of hypertrophic and cardioprotective genes that were identified to be MRTF-\ndependent genes [7]. The structural gene cardiac \u03b1-actin has also been identified as MRTF-\ndependent [18]. Four (cardiac \u03b1-actin, jun-B, fra-1 and adrenomedullin) out of these six \nMRTF-dependent genes contains one or more conserved SRF binding sites which have \nbeen experimentally validated as SRF target genes [7,19-23], suggesting that MS1 causes \nthe over-expression of several genes of the MRTF\/SRF signalling pathways. In addition, \nMS1 increased the expression of the hypertrophic marker BNP, which is known to be a \ndirect target of SRF [24]. Of particular interest, ms1 itself has a conserved SRF binding \n10 \n \nsite, which can be bound by SRF in vivo (Ounzain S and Chong NW, unpublished), raising the \npossibility that ms1 is a SRF target, thus creating a previously unrecognised feed-forward \nmechanism. \n \nPerhaps our most notable finding is the demonstration that MS1 markedly attenuated \nstaurosporine-induced apoptosis of H9c2 cells. The specific mechanism whereby MS1 \nprotects against staurosporine-induced apoptosis remains to be elucidated but it may \ninvolve the expression of Bcl family and related genes [14,15,25]. Specifically we have \nshown that MS1 up-regulated Nol3, a known cardioprotective gene [14,25-27]. \nInterestingly, NOL3 has been shown to inhibit staurosporine-induced apoptosis [15] \ntherefore, it is reasonable to suggest that MS1 may prevent staurosporine-induced apoptosis \nvia NOL3.   \n \nThe technique we employed for assessing the effect of transient MS1 over-\nexpression on apoptosis has been widely used and validated against other assays of \napoptosis [28-30]. Also, we observed a marked protective effect of MS1 against \nstaurosporine-induced apoptosis making it highly likely that the effect is genuine. \nNonetheless, further studies using different assays are necessary to confirm the \ncurrent findings. \n \n \n11 \n \nIn summary, we have demonstrated for the first time the involvement of MS1 in cellular \nhypertrophy and protection possibly via a MRTF\/SRF and\/or NOL3 signalling mechanism. \nAlthough these findings require confirmation in vivo, results presented here provide support \nthat MS1 plays a central role in the MRTF\/SRF signalling pathway, with important cellular \nconsequences. Collectively, these findings support further studies to explore the beneficial \neffects of the MS1-MRTF-SRF and NOL3 pathway as a therapeutic target for the treatment \nof cardiovascular disease. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe thank Samir Ounzain for helpful discussions.
