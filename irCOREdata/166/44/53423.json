The Scandian Event, and the 15 \nformation of the Moine Thrust Zone, have previously been dated by a range of 16 \nisotopic methods, and relatively imprecise ages on a suite of alkaline intrusions 17 \nlocalised along the thrust zone have provided the best age constraints for deformation. 18 \nRecent BGS mapping has improved our understanding of the structural relationships 19 \nof some of these intrusions, and this work is combined with new U-Pb dates in this 20 \npaper to provide significantly improved ages for the Moine Thrust Zone. Our work 21 \nshows that a single early intrusion (the Glen Dessarry Pluton) was emplaced within 22 \nthe orogenic belt to the east of the Moine Thrust Zone at 447.9 \u00b1 2.9 Ma. A more 23 \nsignificant pulse of magmatism centred in the Assynt area, which temporally 24 \noverlapped movement in the thrust zone, occurred at 430.7 \u00b1 0.5 Ma. Movement in 25 \nthe thrust zone had largely ceased by the time of emplacement of the youngest 26 \nintrusions, the late suite of the Loch Borralan Pluton, at 429.2 \u00b1 0.5 Ma, and the Loch 27 \nLoyal Syenite Complex.  28 \n[end of abstract] 29 \n 30 \n 2\n 31 \nThe Caledonian orogenic belt extends from Svalbard, through Scandinavia, Eastern 32 \nGreenland and the British Isles, to the Appalachian mountains of North America, and 33 \nis among the world\u2019s most well-studied collisional orogens. Caledonian orogenesis 34 \ncomprised a number of separate events, which are attributed to the closure of the 35 \nIapetus Ocean during Ordovician to Silurian time, and the subsequent oblique 36 \ncollision of three crustal blocks, Laurentia, Baltica and Eastern Avalonia (e.g. Soper 37 \n& Hutton 1984; Pickering et al. 1988; Soper et al. 1992; McKerrow et al. 2000; 38 \nDewey & Strachan 2003). In Scotland and Ireland, which were part of Laurentia, 39 \nearly orogenic activity resulted from an Ordovician arc-continent collision, the 40 \nGrampian Event (Lambert & McKerrow 1976; Soper et al. 1999). Metamorphism 41 \nassociated with this event has been dated at 465 \u2013 470 Ma (Oliver et al. 2000; Chew 42 \net al. 2008). This was followed by collision of Baltica with Laurentia during the 43 \nSilurian (c. 435-425 Ma), causing the Scandian Event, which was first defined in 44 \nScandinavia (Gee, 1975) and later recognised in Scotland (Coward 1990; Dallmeyer 45 \net al. 2001; Kinny et al. 2003). The western margin of the Caledonian Orogen in 46 \nNorth-west Scotland is defined by the Moine Thrust Zone, which runs from Loch 47 \nEriboll on the north coast to the Isle of Skye (Fig. 1), and which formed during the 48 \nScandian Event.  49 \nConstraints on the timing of the Scandian Event in North-west Scotland are based on 50 \ntwo methods: the application of U-Pb geochronology to igneous intrusions with well-51 \ndefined structural relationships (e.g. van Breemen et al. 1979a,b; Halliday et al. 1987; 52 \nRogers & Dunning 1991; Stewart et al. 2001; Kinny et al. 2003; Kocks et al. 2006); 53 \nand direct dating of minerals grown during ductile deformation (Kelley 1998; 54 \nFreeman et al. 1998; Dallmeyer et al. 2001). In this paper we present the results of an 55 \nintegrated structural and geochronological study of alkaline intrusions that occupy 56 \ndiffering structural settings along the Moine Thrust Zone. We focus in particular on 57 \nthe classic area of the Moine Thrust Zone in Assynt, which has recently been 58 \nremapped (Goodenough et al. 2004; British Geological Survey 2007; Krabbendam & 59 \nLeslie 2010). The data reported here place tight constraints on the age of the Moine 60 \nThrust Zone as well as the timing of ductile deformation within internal sectors of the 61 \norogen, and thus have implications for Caledonian tectonic models in this part of the 62 \nNorth Atlantic region. 63 \n 3\nRegional setting 64 \nThe Moine Thrust Zone defines the western margin of the Caledonian Orogen in 65 \nScotland (Fig. 1). To the west lies the undeformed foreland, first described by Peach 66 \net al. (1907). The foreland basement comprises Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic 67 \ngneisses of the Lewisian Gneiss Complex (Park et al. 2002). An unconformity 68 \nseparates the basement from a thick succession of  Meso- to Neoproterozoic clastic 69 \nsedimentary rocks belonging to the Stoer, Sleat and Torridon groups, commonly 70 \ngrouped under the umbrella term \u2018Torridonian\u2019 (Stewart 2002). The basement 71 \ngneisses and Torridonian succession are both unconformably overlain by a Cambro-72 \nOrdovician sedimentary sequence. This succession, which is dominated by quartz 73 \narenites in its lower part (Ardvreck Group) and dolostones in its upper part (Durness 74 \nGroup), was deposited on the passive margin of eastern Laurentia following opening 75 \nof the Iapetus Ocean (Park et al. 2002). Structurally above, and to the east of, the 76 \nMoine Thrust Zone lie metasedimentary rocks of the Early Neoproterozoic Moine 77 \nSupergroup (Strachan et al. 2002). 78 \nThe Moine Thrust Zone comprises a series of thrust sheets, made up of rocks that are 79 \ncorrelated with the foreland sequences (Lapworth 1883; Peach et al. 1907; Elliott & 80 \nJohnson 1980; Coward 1983; Butler 1987). It is widest in the Assynt Culmination 81 \n(Figs 2, 3) where the component units of the foreland are interleaved in a series of 82 \nmajor thrust sheets (Peach et al. 1907; Elliott & Johnson 1980; Krabbendam & Leslie 83 \n2004; British Geological Survey, 2007). The general consensus is that most thrusts 84 \npropagated in \u2018piggy-back\u2019 sequence towards the foreland (Elliott & Johnson 1980; 85 \nCoward 1985). The structurally highest and hence oldest thrust is the ductile Moine 86 \nThrust, with associated mylonites derived both from the foreland succession and the 87 \noverlying Moine Supergroup. Below the Moine Thrust, the Ben More Thrust carries 88 \nLewisian gneisses, Torridon Group and Ardvreck Group rocks in its hangingwall. The 89 \nunderlying Glencoul Thrust carries Ardvreck Group quartz arenites and Lewisian 90 \ngneisses. The Glencoul Thrust is well-defined in northern Assynt but becomes more 91 \ndifficult to trace southwards, splaying into a complex imbricate system to the east of 92 \nInchnadamph (Elliott & Johnson 1980; Krabbendam & Leslie 2010). The structurally 93 \nlowest and youngest thrust is the Sole Thrust, with imbricates of the Durness Group 94 \nand the upper part of the Ardvreck Group in its hangingwall (Fig. 4). The 95 \ntemperatures of deformation within the Moine Thrust Zone are difficult to establish, 96 \n 4\nbut studies of conodont colour indices and illite crystallinity have indicated a likely 97 \nmaximum temperature range in the lower thrust sheets of 225-325\u00b0C (Johnson et al. 98 \n1985; M.P. Smith pers. comm.). Deformation temperatures associated with ductile 99 \ndeformation in the Moine Thrust sheet were > 500\u00b0C (Thigpen et al. 2010).  100 \nA broadly foreland-propagating sequence of thrusting is indicated by the way in 101 \nwhich the structurally highest thrusts are folded by the development of duplexes in 102 \ntheir footwalls (Elliott & Johnson 1980; Fig. 4). Nonetheless, some structures have an 103 \n\u2018out-of-sequence\u2019 geometry, that has been suggested to result from late movement 104 \n(Coward 1982, 1983, 1985; see also Holdsworth et al. 2006) or simultaneous slip on 105 \nan array of imbricate thrusts (Butler 2004). Thus the ductile Moine Thrust in central 106 \nand northern Assynt is early in the structural sequence, but in southern Assynt it is 107 \nrepresented by a late, out-of-sequence brittle structure (Coward 1985). However, the 108 \noverall displacement on any out-of-sequence structures is not thought to be regionally 109 \nsignificant. The construction of balanced cross-sections across the Assynt 110 \nCulmination indicates a total displacement on the Moine Thrust and lower thrusts 111 \nwithin the Moine Thrust Zone of up to 100 km (Elliott & Johnson 1980), to which can 112 \nbe added an unknown amount of displacement related to development of the 113 \nmylonites within the overlying Moine rocks. 114 \nEast of the Moine Thrust, metasedimentary rocks of the Neoproterozoic Moine 115 \nSupergroup underlie much of the Northern Highlands (Fig. 1), and are disposed in a 116 \nseries of east-dipping ductile thrust nappes (e.g. Barr et al. 1986; Holdsworth 1989; 117 \nHoldsworth et al. 2001; Strachan et al. 2002; Alsop et al. 2010; Leslie et al. 2010). 118 \nThe effects of the earlier Grampian Event appear to be restricted to the eastern and 119 \nstructurally higher Sgurr Beag and Naver nappes (Kinny et al. 1999; Rogers et al. 120 \n2001; Cutts et al. 2010). In contrast, in the western nappes below the Naver and Sgurr 121 \nBeag thrusts (Fig. 1), widespread foreland-propagating ductile thrusting and folding 122 \naccompanied by amphibolite-facies metamorphism is assigned to the Scandian Event, 123 \nand culminated in the development of the Moine Thrust Zone (Strachan & 124 \nHoldsworth 1988; Holdsworth 1989; Dallmeyer et al. 2001; Strachan et al. 2002; 125 \nKinny et al. 2003; Holdsworth et al. 2006, 2007; Alsop et al. 2010; Leslie et al. 2010; 126 \nKrabbendam et al. in press). Above the Sgurr Beag Thrust, Scandian deformation led 127 \nto the development of regional-scale upright folding in a zone known as the Northern 128 \nHighland Steep Belt (Roberts et al. 1984; Strachan & Evans 2008). 129 \n 5\nSyn-tectonic metagranites within the western part of the Moine outcrop have yielded 130 \nU-Pb (SIMS) zircon ages of c. 430-415 Ma (Kinny et al. 2003; Alsop et al. 2010), 131 \nbroadly constraining the age of the Scandian Event. Dating of micas in the Moine 132 \nThrust mylonites, using the Rb-Sr, K-Ar and Ar-Ar isotope systems (Kelley 1988; 133 \nFreeman et al. 1998; Dallmeyer et al. 2001), has also yielded a range of Silurian to 134 \nDevonian ages. All of these studies pointed to the continuation of deformation along 135 \nthe Moine Thrust after 430 Ma, and Freeman et al. (1998) suggested that transfer of 136 \nmovement from the Moine Thrust on to the underlying Ben More Thrust may have 137 \noccurred at c. 430 Ma. In order to further constrain the timing of regional deformation 138 \nand marginal thrusting we now focus on the structural setting and U-Pb 139 \ngeochronology of alkaline intrusions that intrude the Moine Thrust Zone and Moine 140 \nSupergroup.  141 \n 142 \nAlkaline to calc-alkaline magmatism in the North-west Highlands 143 \nThe Ordovician - Silurian closure of the Iapetus Ocean was associated with 144 \nvoluminous calc-alkaline and minor alkaline magmatism in the Scottish Highlands 145 \n(e.g. Read 1961; Stephenson et al. 1999). The calc-alkaline magmatism has been 146 \ngenerally attributed to NW-directed subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath the 147 \nLaurentian margin (e.g. Dewey 1971; van Breemen & Bluck 1981; Fowler et al. 148 \n2001; Oliver et al. 2008), with a major magmatic pulse during the late Silurian and 149 \nearly Devonian being caused by slab break-off (Atherton & Ghani 2002; Neilson et 150 \nal. 2009).  151 \nIn the North-west Highlands, a number of alkaline plutons, together with abundant 152 \ncalc-alkaline to alkaline dykes and sills, intrude across the Moine Thrust Zone and 153 \ninto both the foreland and the Moine Supergroup (Peach et al. 1907; Parsons 1999). 154 \nThese magmas are generally thought to be shoshonitic in nature, generated at some 155 \ndistance from the active subduction zone (Thompson & Fowler 1986; Thirlwall & 156 \nBurnard 1990; Fowler et al. 2008). 157 \nThe most extensive alkaline magmatism occurred within the Assynt Culmination (Fig. 158 \n2). Two major syenite plutons intrude the culmination, the Loch Ailsh Pluton 159 \n(Phemister 1926; Parsons 1965 a,b) and the Loch Borralan Pluton (Woolley 1970, 160 \n1973), as well as a wide range of sills and dykes (Sabine 1953; Goodenough et al. 161 \n 6\n2004). The Loch Ailsh Pluton and the majority of the minor intrusions are considered 162 \nto have been deformed by thrust movement within the Moine Thrust Zone (Parsons 163 \n1999; Goodenough et al. 2004), whereas emplacement of the Loch Borralan Pluton, 164 \nwhich comprises two separate magmatic suites, has been shown to have overlapped 165 \nwith thrusting, as described in detail below (Woolley 1970).  166 \nAbove the Moine Thrust, the Loch Loyal Syenite Complex and the Glen Dessarry and 167 \nRatagain plutons intrude the Moine Supergroup (Fig. 1). The Glen Dessarry Pluton, 168 \nthe southern-most of the alkaline intrusions, has a penetrative Caledonian fabric that 169 \nformed during upright folding and development of the Northern Highland Steep Belt 170 \n(Roberts et al. 1984). In contrast, the Loch Loyal Syenite Complex clearly post-dates 171 \nthe main ductile deformation and metamorphism in the host Moine rocks (Holdsworth 172 \net al. 1999). All the main plutons have been dated by previous workers using U-Pb 173 \ntechniques on zircon (Fig. 6). The oldest, deformed Glen Dessarry Pluton has been 174 \ndated at 456 \u00b1 5 Ma (van Breemen et al. 1979b). The Loch Ailsh Pluton (439 \u00b1 4 Ma; 175 \nHalliday et al. 1987), and the Canisp Porphyry Sills (437 \u00b1 5 Ma; Goodenough et al. 176 \n2006) pre-date movements in the Moine Thrust Zone (Parsons 1999; Goodenough et 177 \nal. 2004) and these dates have been considered to provide a maximum age for the 178 \nonset of thrusting. The Loch Borralan Pluton has been dated at 430 \u00b1 4 Ma (van 179 \nBreemen et al. 1979a), but this date was based on a number of samples derived from 180 \ndifferent intrusive phases with varied structural relationships (as mapped by Woolley 181 \n1970) and so the exact relationship of the age to thrusting was unclear. Later workers 182 \nhave generally assumed that this age post-dates movement within the Moine Thrust 183 \nZone (e.g. Halliday et al. 1987). The post-deformation Loch Loyal Syenite Complex 184 \nhas been dated at 426 \u00b1 9 Ma (Halliday et al. 1987). 185 \nMany of the existing U-Pb zircon data are highly discordant, and record an apparently 186 \nlarge spread in ages (from c. 456 to c. 426 Ma) for emplacement of geochemically 187 \nsimilar intrusions. Recent years have seen advances in geochronological techniques, 188 \nas well as an increased understanding of the field relationships in the Moine Thrust 189 \nZone, and so a new integrated structural and geochronological study of the 190 \nCaledonian alkaline intrusions of North-west Scotland is timely.    191 \n 192 \nStructural settings of the alkaline intrusions 193 \n 7\nThese are described in their likely order from oldest to youngest, based on published 194 \ngeochronology where available (see above). 195 \nGlen Dessarry Pluton 196 \nThe Glen Dessarry Pluton is located within the Sgurr Beag Nappe, over 100 km to the 197 \nsouth of the other syenite plutons discussed here, and over 30 km east of the trace of 198 \nthe Moine Thrust to the south of the Isle of Skye (Fig. 1). Nonetheless it is typically 199 \ngrouped with the other syenite plutons, on the basis of similar petrology and 200 \ngeochemistry (e.g. Fowler et al. 2008). It comprises an outer mafic syenite, with a 201 \ncore of felsic syenite (Richardson 1968). The pluton intrudes Moine psammites 202 \nassigned to the Loch Eil Group and occupies the core of a large, curvilinear synform 203 \n(Roberts et al. 1984). The intrusion post-dates two early deformation phases in its 204 \nhost Moine rocks, but it carries a penetrative solid state deformation fabric that is 205 \nrelated to the widespread tight to isoclinal upright folding of the Northern Highland 206 \nSteep Belt (Roberts et al. 1984).  207 \nThe Loch Ailsh Pluton 208 \nThe syenites of the Loch Ailsh Pluton lie directly beneath the Moine Thrust and 209 \nintrude Lewisian and Cambrian rocks of the Ben More Thrust sheet in the Assynt 210 \nCulmination (Fig. 3).  The pluton comprises three phases, termed S1, S2, and S3, 211 \nwhich are considered to be broadly contemporaneous (Parsons 1965b; Fig. 3). 212 \nAlthough their contact with the Moine Thrust is not exposed, geophysical evidence 213 \nsuggests that the plutonic rocks extend to the east beneath the thrust (Parsons 1965a). 214 \nThe syenites have been mylonitised in a number of localised shear zones associated 215 \nwith thrusting, with recrystallisation of large perthitic feldspars to fine-grained albite-216 \nrich aggregates (Parsons 1965b). The Ben More Thrust sheet has not been affected by 217 \nsignificant internal deformation, and there are no exposed contacts between the Loch 218 \nAilsh Pluton and mappable thrusts. However, a rhyolite dyke which cuts the S2 219 \nsyenites at [NC 3269 1365] is part of the Peralkaline Rhyolite Swarm, which was 220 \ndeformed by movement associated with the Glencoul and Ben More thrusts 221 \n(Goodenough et al. 2004). If this dyke swarm represents a single intrusive episode, 222 \nthen the Loch Ailsh Pluton was emplaced prior to movement on these thrusts.  223 \nMinor intrusions 224 \n 8\nThe minor intrusions of the Assynt Culmination comprise six swarms (Canisp 225 \nPorphyry, Peralkaline Rhyolite, Hornblende Microdiorite, Nordmarkite, Vogesite and 226 \nPorphyritic Trachyte swarms), most of which pre-date thrusting (Sabine 1953; 227 \nGoodenough et al. 2004). The Canisp Porphyry sills are found below, and close to,  228 \nthe Sole Thrust (Parsons 1999) but do not appear above it, and so are considered to 229 \npre-date movement on that thrust. The Peralkaline Rhyolite, Hornblende Microdiorite, 230 \nand Vogesite swarms outcrop within the Moine Thrust Zone in Assynt, and are 231 \naffected by thrust-related deformation (Goodenough et al. 2004). 232 \nThe intrusions of the Nordmarkite Swarm are unusual in that they crop out along, and 233 \non both sides of, the Moine Thrust and within the Moine rocks to the east (Parsons 234 \n1999; Goodenough et al. 2004). Since the rocks in the hangingwall of the Moine 235 \nThrust may have moved up to 100 km westwards to their present position (Elliott & 236 \nJohnson 1980), the nordmarkite intrusions must post-date the main movement on the 237 \nMoine Thrust. However, the intrusions close to the Moine Thrust have mylonitic 238 \nmargins, indicating that they were emplaced before final movement had ceased.  239 \nThe Loch Borralan Pluton 240 \nThe Loch Borralan Pluton includes a range of unusual rock-types such as \u2018borolanite\u2019 241 \n(a melanite-biotite nepheline-syenite with white spots that represent pseudomorphs 242 \nafter leucite) and \u2018ledmorite\u2019 (a melanite-augite nepheline-syenite) (Shand 1909, 243 \n1910, 1939). Woolley (1970) identified two separate suites, separated by an intrusive 244 \ncontact (Fig. 3). The early suite consists of a poorly-exposed \u2018conformable sheeted 245 \ncomplex\u2019 (Woolley 1970) comprising locally foliated pseudoleucite syenites 246 \n(\u2018borolanites\u2019) and nepheline syenites (\u2018ledmorites\u2019) as well as mafic to ultramafic 247 \nrocks. In contrast, the late suite, which is rather better exposed on the hill of Cnoc na 248 \nSroine (Fig. 3), forms a steep-sided plug of syenite and quartz-syenite, undeformed 249 \nexcept for some late fracturing. Woolley (1970) suggested that at least part of the 250 \nearly suite was intruded prior to movement on local thrusts, whilst the late suite post-251 \ndated thrusting. However, the structural relationships of the early suite have been the 252 \nsubject of debate, because some workers have suggested that the syenites form a 253 \nsingle mass that has been deformed and transported by thrust movement (Coward 254 \n1985; Searle et al. 2010). The debate centres on a handful of key contact localities 255 \n(Parsons 1999), which are briefly summarised here. 256 \n 9\nAt the north-western margin of the pluton, the marble quarry at Ledbeg [NC 252 135] 257 \nexposes sheets of pseudoleucite syenite 1-2 m across cutting metasomatised 258 \ndolostones of the Durness Group in the Sole Thrust sheet. These outcrops lie in the 259 \nfootwall to the \u2018Borralan Thrust\u2019 of Searle et al. 2010, clearly indicating that this 260 \nthrust is cross-cut by rocks of the early suite. Just north of the quarry around [NC 257 261 \n145] lies an isolated mass of nepheline syenite (the Loyne Mass of Woolley 1970), 262 \nwhose relationships to thrusts are not well exposed (Searle et al., 2010). In the north-263 \neast of the Loch Borralan Pluton, at the Four Burns locality [NC 293 132], nepheline-264 \nsyenite sheets intrude dolostones and quartz arenites immediately beneath the Ben 265 \nMore Thrust (Woolley 1970; Woolley et al. 1972). These sedimentary rocks lie within 266 \nan imbricate stack termed the Breabag Dome (Elliott and Johnson 1980; Coward 267 \n1984; British Geological Survey 2007; Krabbendam and Leslie 2010). The exposures 268 \nat the Four Burns are thus significantly higher in the thrust pile than the exposures 269 \naround Ledbeg (Figs. 3, 4). At the southern margin of the pluton, Ardvreck Group 270 \nquartz arenites that have been fenitised by the syenite intrusion are exposed around 271 \n[NC 285 284] (Woolley et al. 1972). Again, these quartz arenites are structurally 272 \nhigher than the dolostones around Ledbeg (British Geological Survey 2007).  273 \nA key contact of the Loch Borralan Pluton is exposed to the south of Loch Borralan, 274 \nat Bad na h-Achlaise [NC 245 115], and has been excavated to improve the exposure 275 \n(Parsons & McKirdy 1983). At this locality, syenites attributed to the early suite 276 \nintrude Ardvreck Group quartz arenites that are part of the Cam Loch thrust klippe 277 \n(Parsons & McKirdy 1983; British Geological Survey 2007) (Fig. 3). This klippe has 278 \nbeen considered to be floored by the Ben More Thrust (Elliott & Johnson 1980; 279 \nCoward 1985) but may equally be a separate thrust (Butler 2009; Searle et al. 2010). 280 \nA short distance to the south-east of Bad na h-Achlaise, ultramafic rocks of the early 281 \nsuite, together with a small carbonatite body, intrude Durness Group dolostones in the 282 \nfootwall to the Cam Loch thrust (Shaw et al. 1992; Young et al. 1994).  283 \nThe best single exposure of the early suite rocks occurs at the Aultivullin quarry [NC 284 \n2870 0965], where the pseudoleucite-syenites are well exposed. Here the white 285 \npseudoleucite spots are streaked and flattened into ellipses that define a south-easterly 286 \ndipping foliation. Cross-cutting pegmatites appear undeformed, and this led Bailey & 287 \nMcCallien (1934) to suggest that the earlier parts of the Loch Borralan Pluton were 288 \nemplaced prior to thrusting, with later intrusions post-dating thrusting. Woolley 289 \n 10\n(1970) studied the petrography of the pseudoleucite-syenites, and observed \u201ca 290 \ncomplete overlap of crystallisation by deformation\u201d, indicating a syn-tectonic age. 291 \nSimilarly, Elliott & Johnson (1980) noted that the foliation probably formed during 292 \nemplacement of the pluton. However, Searle et al. (2010) argue that the foliation 293 \nformed after crystallisation of the magmas.  294 \nThe field evidence as described here indicates that intrusions belonging to the early 295 \nsuite of the Loch Borralan Pluton clearly cut across a number of thrusts between the 296 \nSole and Ben More thrusts (Fig. 3; Parsons & McKirdy 1983; Parsons 1999; British 297 \nGeological Survey 2007). The overall outcrop pattern indicates that the Loch Borralan 298 \nPluton was intruded into quartzite-dominated imbricates to the north and dolostone-299 \ndominated imbricates to the south, and thus was probably focused along a lateral 300 \nramp. The contacts of the early suite of the Loch Borralan Pluton have a sheeted form 301 \n(e.g. at the Four Burns and at Ledbeg Quarry) and the whole suite is considered to be 302 \nformed of a series of sheets, emplaced along thrust planes during thrusting. We follow 303 \nthe detailed study of Woolley (1970) in concluding that emplacement of the early 304 \nsuite overlapped with thrust movement, but that the later suite clearly post-dates thrust 305 \nmovement; the observed field relationships do not fit with the proposal of Searle et al. 306 \n(2010) for movement of the entire Loch Borralan Pluton on a Borralan Thrust.   307 \nThe Loch Loyal Syenite Complex 308 \nThe Loch Loyal Syenite Complex intrudes the Moine Supergroup c. 15 km east of the 309 \nMoine Thrust (Fig. 1). It consists of three separate, but related, quartz-syenite bodies, 310 \nthe Ben Loyal, Ben Stumanadh and Cnoc nan Cuilean intrusions (Robertson and 311 \nParsons 1974; Holdsworth et al. 1999, 2001). Intrusion of the Loch Loyal syenites 312 \npost-dated regional (Scandian) D2 and D3 folding and ductile thrusting in this part of 313 \nthe Moine (Read 1931; Holdsworth et al. 1999, 2001).  314 \n 315 \nU-Pb Geochronology  316 \nTechniques for dating zircons using isotope-dilution thermal ionisation mass 317 \nspectrometry (ID-TIMS) have improved significantly in recent years.  The early 318 \nstudies of the Loch Borralan and Loch Ailsh plutons, by van Breemen et al. (1979a) 319 \nand Halliday et al. (1987), required dissolution of multi-milligram zircon fractions 320 \nthat were highly discordant due to Pb-loss.  Subsequently, methods have been 321 \n 11\ndeveloped to allow low-blank zircon dissolution and chemical separation of U and Pb 322 \n(Krogh 1973; Parrish 1987), to reduce discordance due to Pb-loss using air abrasion 323 \n(Krogh 1982),  and to improve analytical precision and accuracy using gravimetrically 324 \nwell-calibrated synthetic isotope tracers (Parrish & Krogh 1987; Parrish et al. 2006).  325 \nRecently, Mattinson (2005) reported a method of annealing and chemically abrading 326 \nzircons (CA-TIMS), which in many cases eliminates discordance due to Pb-loss.  327 \nTogether, these advances allow increasingly precise (and accurate, subject to 328 \nuncertainties in decay constants and tracer calibrations) ages to be determined on 329 \nsingle zircon crystals or crystal fragments. Ongoing research, co-ordinated by the 330 \nEARTHTIME initiative (www.earth-time.org), aims to improve the accuracy and 331 \nprecision of uranium decay constants and the natural 235U\/238U ratio,  calibrate and 332 \ndistribute interlaboratory standards, develop open-source universal data-reduction 333 \nsoftware, and intercalibrate U-Pb, Ar-Ar and cyclostratigraphic dating techniques.   334 \nMethodology 335 \nZircons were separated using standard crushing and mineral separation techniques. 336 \nThe best quality zircons were picked, annealed, and subjected to chemical abrasion 337 \n(CA: Mattinson 2005) to improve concordance. Single grains were spiked with a 338 \nmixed 205Pb\/235U tracer (Parrish & Krogh 1987) or mixed 205Pb\/235U\/233U tracer 339 \n(Parrish et al. 2006) and dissolved in teflon microcapsules (Parrish 1987).  Titanites 340 \nwere separated from the Glen Dessarry sample using standard techniques, and 341 \ndissolved in Savillex\u00ae beakers. U and Pb were separated following Corfu and Noble 342 \n(1992) and references therein. U and Pb were loaded together onto single rhenium 343 \nfilaments using silica gel, and measured by peak-jumping using a secondary electron 344 \nmultiplier on a Thermo-Electron Triton thermal ionization mass spectrometer.  Raw 345 \ndata were reprocessed offline using MATLAB\u00ae in order to allow time-interpolated 346 \ncorrection of isobaric interferences.  Data reduction was carried out using the UPbR 347 \nspreadsheet derived from the algorithms of Schmitz & Schoene (2007). Ages were 348 \ncalculated using Isoplot 3.16 (Ludwig 2003).   349 \n 350 \nSample descriptions 351 \nA sample of felsic (meta)syenite (GDS-1) was collected from the Glen Dessarry 352 \nPluton at [NM 9515 9217]. The sample is coarse grained and carries a penetrative 353 \n 12\nsolid-state deformation fabric defined by augen of recrystallised alkali feldspar and 354 \nsub-parallel grains of aligned hornblende and biotite. Magnetite, titanite and zircon 355 \nare common accessory minerals.    356 \nA sample of the Loch Ailsh Pluton (KG014) was collected from outcrops in the River 357 \nOykel near the centre of the intrusion, within the S2 syenites, at [NC 3272 1319]. It is 358 \na coarse-grained syenite, consisting chiefly of plates of microperthitic alkali feldspar 359 \nwith small amounts (<10%) of a green pyroxene; titanite and zircon are common 360 \naccessories. The feldspar plates appear largely undeformed, but do exhibit swapped 361 \nrims, which are common in the Loch Ailsh Pluton and are considered to have formed 362 \nduring thrust movement (Parsons, 1965b) 363 \nA sample of Canisp Porphyry (KG023) was collected from a sill intruding Ardvreck 364 \nGroup quartz arenites below the Sole Thrust at [NC 2410 2128]. The sample is 365 \nstrongly porphyritic, with large (up to 1 cm) euhedral albite phenocrysts in a fine-366 \ngrained, structureless quartzofeldspathic groundmass. Biotite is the main mafic 367 \nmineral. This sample has previously yielded a U-Pb zircon age of 437 \u00b1 4.8 Ma 368 \n(Goodenough et al. 2006) and has been re-analysed as part of the present study.  369 \nA sample of a nordmarkite intrusion (KG050) was taken from a c. 1m-thick sill that 370 \nintrudes dolostones of the Durness Group immediately beneath the Moine Thrust to 371 \nthe south of Loch Ailsh [NC 3010 0833]. The sample contains irregular, strongly 372 \nsericitised plates of albite up to c. 2 mm, in a very fine-grained quartzofeldspathic 373 \nmatrix. The matrix has a penetrative solid-state deformation fabric defined by 374 \nelongate aggregates of recrystallised quartz, and stringers of fine-grained chlorite and 375 \nbiotite.  376 \nThree samples were collected from the Loch Borralan Pluton. Sample IM2.1 was 377 \ncollected from Bad na h-Achlaise where early suite syenites cut quartz arenite of the 378 \nCam Loch thrust klippe [NC 2442 1152]. The sample is coarse grained and consists 379 \nlargely of plates of perthitic feldspar, with rare aegirine augite. Sample IM4.1 was 380 \ncollected from the early suite at Aultivullin Quarry [NC 2870 0965]. It is coarse 381 \ngrained, consisting of laths of perthitic feldspar with nepheline, brown melanite 382 \ngarnet, biotite and hornblende. Aggregates of fine-grained feldspar, nepheline and 383 \nwhite mica form pseudoleucite spots. Accessory minerals include titanite, apatite and 384 \ncarbonates. In hand specimen, a foliation is visible, chiefly defined by flattened 385 \n 13\npseudoleucites; at thin-section scale, the foliation is only weakly defined by a broad 386 \nparallelism of feldspar laths and biotite flakes. Feldspars are locally recrystallised to 387 \nsubgrains.  Sample IM1.1 was collected from the late suite near the summit of Cnoc 388 \nna Sroine [NC 2550 1225]. The sample is coarse grained and unfoliated, and consists 389 \nchiefly of laths of perthitic feldspar with interstitial quartz. 390 \nA sample (Loyal1) of the Loch Loyal Syenite Complex was collected from [NC 6125 391 \n4980]. The sample was obtained from the outer marginal syenite of the Ben Loyal 392 \nbody. It is medium to coarse grained, and consists of alkali feldspar, albite, quartz and 393 \nhornblende with minor titanite, apatite and opaque oxides. A magmatic-state 394 \ndeformation fabric is defined by the alignment of feldspar laths and hornblende.     395 \n 396 \nResults and Interpretation 397 \nGlen Dessarry Pluton  398 \nEight single zircon grains and three titanite fractions were analysed from the Glen 399 \nDessarry syenite (sample GDS-1, Table 1, Fig. 5a).  Of these, two grains (GDS-1 z1 400 \nand z5; not plotted in Fig 5a) show reverse discordance and must contain inherited 401 \ncores.  Three further grains (GDS-1 z2, z3, z4; not plotted in Fig. 5a) were small (sub-402 \nmicrogram), and their analyses had low ratios of radiogenic to common lead, resulting 403 \nin imprecise analyses that scatter around concordia, with a mean 206Pb\/238U age of 448 404 \nMa.  Three larger grains (GDS-1 z6, z8, z9) give precise, concordant analyses, with a 405 \nweighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 447.9 \u00b1 2.9 Ma.  The three analysed titanite fractions 406 \nare relatively non-radiogenic (206Pb\/204Pb  from 55 to 62).  However, when corrected 407 \nfor common lead using the Stacey-Kramers model at 450 Ma, they yield concordant 408 \ndata, with a mean 206Pb\/238U  age of 445.7 \u00b1 8.0 Ma, and a concordia age of 445.3 \u00b1 409 \n1.9 Ma. 410 \nLoch Ailsh Pluton  411 \nEight single zircon grains were analysed from the Loch Ailsh Pluton (sample KG014; 412 \nFig. 5b).  Of these, one (KG014z3) is highly discordant, and appears to have suffered 413 \nPb-loss, despite having undergone chemical abrasion.  Of the remaining seven grains, 414 \none (KG014z4) gave a relatively imprecise analysis, but is included as it overlaps the 415 \nother analyses.  The seven analyses all overlap concordia, with a weighted mean 416 \n206Pb\/238U age of 430.6 \u00b1 0.3 Ma.  In detail, five fractions have near-identical 417 \n 14\n206Pb\/238U ages (fraction KG014z7 has a slightly younger 206Pb\/238U age, and might 418 \nhave suffered Pb-loss, and KG014z5 has a slightly older 206Pb\/238U age, perhaps 419 \nindicating a small degree of inheritance).  However, the weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age 420 \nof these five analyses (430.6 \u00b1 0.2 Ma) is identical to the age given by all seven 421 \nconcordant fractions.  Rather than over-interpreting the data, we prefer the age of 422 \n430.6 \u00b1 0.3 Ma for the Loch Ailsh Pluton, derived from all seven concordant 423 \nanalyses.  424 \nCanisp Porphyry  425 \nTen single zircon grains were analysed from the Canisp Porphyry sample (KG023; 426 \nFig. 5c).  Of these, two (KG023z1, KG023z2) are highly reversely discordant and 427 \nmust contain inherited cores.  Two fractions (KG023z3, KG023z5) are concordant, 428 \nbut with slightly older 206Pb\/238U ages than the bulk of the zircon data, perhaps 429 \nindicating a small degree of inheritance of slightly older zircon.  The six remaining 430 \nfractions are concordant, and form a cluster with a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 431 \n430.4 \u00b1 0.4 Ma.  Mixture modelling (Sambridge & Compston 1994, as implemented 432 \nby Ludwig 2003) is consistent with the interpretation of these six analyses as forming 433 \na single normally-distributed age population, with the two slightly older concordant 434 \nfractions representing a separate, older population. 435 \nNordmarkite Swarm 436 \nFive single grains were analysed from a sample of nordmarkite (KG50; 5d).  Three of 437 \nthe five analyses contained high levels (tens of picograms) of common Pb, and 438 \nyielded imprecise analyses. All five grains are discordant, with a wide range of 439 \n206Pb\/238U  ages from 437 to 1979 Ma.  The data scatter around a discordia with an 440 \nupper intercept age of 2740 Ma, and a lower intercept of 420 Ma.  A regression 441 \nthrough the two analyses closest to the lower intercept intersects concordia at 430 Ma.   442 \nLoch Borralan early suite  443 \nFour single zircon grains were analysed from the Bad na h-Achlaise early suite 444 \nsyenite vein (sample IM.2.1; Fig. 5e).   All four analyses are highly discordant.  445 \nForcing a regression line through 430 Ma yields an Archaean upper intercept at 446 \naround 2580 Ma.  Three of the grains define a discordia with upper and lower 447 \nintercepts at 2939 \u00b1 13 Ma and 1329 \u00b1 19 Ma respectively (MSWD = 0.58).  448 \nHowever, Mesoproterozoic events are not recorded by detrital zircons in Ardvreck 449 \n 15\nGroup quartz arenites (Cawood et al. 2007), so this discordia is almost certainly 450 \ncoincidental and has no geological significance. 451 \nFour single zircon grains were analysed from the Loch Borralan pseudoleucite syenite 452 \nat Aultivullin Quarry (sample IM.4.1; Fig. 5f).  All four analyses overlap concordia, 453 \nand give a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 431.1 \u00b1 1.2 Ma.   454 \nLoch Borralan late suite  455 \nFour single zircon grains were analysed from the Loch Borralan quartz syenite 456 \n(sample IM.1.1; Fig. 5g).  All four analyses overlap concordia, and give a weighted 457 \nmean 206Pb\/238U age of 429.2 \u00b1 0.5 Ma.   458 \nLoch Loyal Syenite Complex  459 \nTwelve single zircon grains were analysed from the Loch Loyal syenite complex 460 \n(Sample Loyal1; Fig. 5h).  All but one are highly discordant.  Assuming a lower 461 \nintercept age of 425 Ma, these indicate the presence of inherited components between 462 \n1000 and 2500 Ma in age.  One single grain is concordant, with a 206Pb\/238U  age of c. 463 \n425 Ma. 464 \n 465 \nDiscussion 466 \nComparison with previously published ages 467 \nThe new age obtained for the Glen Dessarry Pluton of 447.9 \u00b1 2.9 is significantly 468 \nyounger than the published age of 456 \u00b1 5 Ma (van Breemen et al. 1979b).  However, 469 \nin detail, the zircon data of van Breemen et al. (1979b) are slightly discordant, and 470 \nthis was interpreted as resulting from a small, but similar degree of Pb-loss in all four 471 \nanalysed fractions (data are plotted in Fig. 5a, with nominal errors as these were not 472 \nreported by van Breemen et al. 1979b).  It is more likely that the shift to the right of 473 \nconcordia is caused by a slight inaccuracy in the applied common lead correction, 474 \ntogether with uncertainty in uranium decay constants (see discussion of Canisp 475 \nPorphyry below).  If this is the case, the preferred age derived from the data of van 476 \nBreemen et al. (1979b) would be defined by the mean 206Pb\/238U model age, at around 477 \n448.5 Ma.  Notably, the titanite age reported by van Breemen et al. (445 \u00b1 5 Ma) is 478 \nidentical to that presented here (concordia age = 445.3 \u00b1 1.9 Ma).  The new date for 479 \n 16\nthe Glen Dessarry Pluton of 447.9 \u00b1 2.9 Ma confirms that this intrusion is distinctly 480 \nolder than the syenite plutons to the north.  481 \nThe age of 430.6 \u00b1 0.3 Ma obtained here for the Loch Ailsh Pluton is significantly 482 \nyounger than the previously accepted age of 439 \u00b1 4 Ma (Fig. 6), which was based on 483 \nanalysis of six large size fractions of zircon from two different syenite samples 484 \n(Halliday et al. 1987).  The resulting data were highly discordant, with 206Pb\/238U ages 485 \nbetween 337 and 382 Ma.  Nonetheless, if modern Pb-loss is assumed, and a 486 \nregression is forced through 0 Ma, these data would define a discordia with an upper 487 \nintercept age of c. 435 Ma.  Halliday et al. (1987) chose to derive their age using a 488 \nPb-Pb regression, which is highly dependent on the assumption of modern Pb-loss, 489 \nand the common lead composition used for correction of the analyses.  The age of 490 \n430.6 \u00b1 0.3 Ma presented here is derived from seven concordant analyses of 491 \nchemically abraded single zircon grains, and is clearly more reliable than the 492 \npreviously published age. 493 \nThe zircons analysed from the nordmarkite sill were highly discordant, and do not 494 \nyield a statistically meaningful age.  However, the lower intercept of the least 495 \ndiscordant analyses (c. 430 Ma) lies within the range defined by the other syenite 496 \nbodies from Assynt.  497 \nThe ages of 431.1 \u00b1 1.2 Ma and 429.2 \u00b1 0.5 Ma presented here, for the Loch Borralan 498 \nPluton early suite and late suite respectively, are within error of the age of 430 \u00b1 4 Ma 499 \nreported by van Breemen et al. (1979a), which was derived from four samples from 500 \nboth early and late intrusive phases (Fig. 6). However, the increased precision on our 501 \nnew dates allows us to resolve the age difference between the two suites.     502 \nThe age of 430.4 \u00b1 0.4 presented here for the Canisp Porphyry is significantly 503 \nyounger than the published age of 437 \u00b1 5 Ma (Goodenough et al. 2006).  The zircons 504 \nanalysed by Goodenough et al. (2006) were physically, but not chemically abraded, 505 \nand show varying degrees of Pb-loss.  The age of 437 \u00b1 5 Ma was derived by forcing 506 \na regression line through 0 \u00b1 10 Ma, and closely approximates to the mean 207Pb\/206Pb 507 \nmodel age of the zircons.  In detail, however, the zircon fraction with the least 508 \napparent Pb-loss has a 206Pb\/238U model age of 430.6 Ma, within error of the age of 509 \n430.4 \u00b1 0.4 Ma presented here.  It seems probable that a combination of analytical 510 \nartefacts has shifted the data of Goodenough et al. (2006) slightly to the right (i.e. to 511 \n 17\nhigh 207Pb\/235U) on the concordia diagram, leading to artificially high 207Pb\/206Pb 512 \nages.   There are three possible explanations for this:  (1) Uncertainty in U decay 513 \nconstants, in particular that of 235U, leads to a systematic bias (Schoene et al. 2006).  514 \n207Pb\/206Pb ages are systematically older than 206Pb\/238U ages by between 0.15% in 515 \nPrecambrian samples to as much as 3.3% in Mesozoic samples (Schoene et al. 2006). 516 \nAt c. 430 Ma, this effect would lead to 207Pb\/206Pb ages being overestimated by c. 2-3 517 \nMa.  (2) Uncertainty in the correction applied for initial common Pb and\/or blank can 518 \nhave a significant effect on the 207Pb\/206Pb age of a zircon.  Goodenough et al. (2006) 519 \nused the model of Stacey & Kramers (1975) to estimate the initial common Pb 520 \ncomposition at 430 Ma, whereas in this study we use the measured feldspar values of 521 \nvan Breemen et al. (1979a). (3) At the time of analysis of the zircons described by 522 \nGoodenough et al. (2006), organic interferences were affecting some analyses at the 523 \nNERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory.  The effect of these interferences was to shift 524 \ndata ellipses towards the right on Concordia diagrams.  This problem was eliminated 525 \nbefore the analyses presented here were carried out, by the use of oil-free pumps 526 \nthroughout the laboratory.  We therefore feel that our weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age 527 \nof 430.4 \u00b1 0.4 Ma, based on six concordant zircon analyses, is the best estimate for 528 \nthe age of the Canisp Porphyry. 529 \nOnly one concordant analysis was obtained from the Loch Loyal syenite complex, 530 \nindicating an age of around 425 Ma.  This is in agreement with the published age of 531 \n426 \u00b1 9 Ma, based on three normally discordant zircon size fractions (Halliday et al. 532 \n1987). 533 \n 534 \nTiming of Caledonian deformation 535 \nThe Glen Dessarry Pluton post-dates early, regional deformation in the host Moine 536 \nrocks, but pre-dates the formation of the Northern Highland Steep Belt (Roberts et al. 537 \n1984). The new date of 447.9 \u00b1 2.9 Ma thus supports the existing consensus that the 538 \nearlier deformation is Grampian (Ordovician) in age, but that the Northern Highland 539 \nSteep Belt formed during the Scandian Event (Strachan & Evans, 2008). 540 \nThe new date for the Loch Ailsh Pluton of 430.6 \u00b1 0.3 Ma, the revised date for the 541 \nCanisp Porphyry of 430.4 \u00b1 0.4 Ma, and the new date for the early suite at Loch 542 \nBorralan (431.1 \u00b1 1.2 Ma) are all within error of each other and indicate a pulse of 543 \n 18\nalkaline magmatism at c. 430.5 to 431 Ma. The weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of all 544 \n19 concordant analyses from these samples is 430.7 \u00b1 0.5 Ma, which is the preferred 545 \nage for this earlier pulse of magmatism in the Assynt area. Field relationships show 546 \nthat the Loch Ailsh Pluton and the Canisp Porphyry sills were emplaced before or 547 \nduring thrusting in the Moine Thrust Zone, whilst emplacement of the early suite of 548 \nthe Loch Borralan Pluton overlapped with thrusting. Overall, then, the early pulse of 549 \nmagmatism overlapped with movement in the Moine Thrust Zone.  550 \nThe late suite of the Loch Borralan Pluton, which is undeformed and can be shown to 551 \npost-date thrust movement, is also clearly younger than the other intrusions, at 429.2 552 \n\u00b1 0.5 Ma. Although a reliable new date for the Loch Loyal Syenite Complex has not 553 \nbeen obtained, the presence of a single concordant zircon at c. 425 Ma, together with 554 \nthe observed field relationships, indicate that this is likely to be part of the same, 555 \nslightly later, pulse of magmatism as the late suite of the Loch Borralan Pluton.  556 \nThe new dates allow us to place detailed constraints on the timing of collision-related 557 \ndeformation in the Moine Thrust Zone. The earliest ductile movements on the Moine 558 \nThrust itself are not constrained, but it is evident that such movements continued after 559 \n430.6 \u00b1 0.3 Ma, since the rocks of the Loch Ailsh Pluton are locally mylonitised. 560 \nWithin the Moine Thrust Zone (ie between the Moine and Sole thrusts), thrust 561 \nmovement overlapped with emplacement of the Loch Ailsh Pluton, the Canisp 562 \nPorphyry sills, and the early suite of the Loch Borralan Pluton at 430.7 \u00b1 0.5 Ma. 563 \nHowever, movement on these thrusts had ceased by the time the late suite of the Loch 564 \nBorralan Pluton was emplaced at 429.2 \u00b1 0.5 Ma. It is conceivable that minor 565 \ndeformation could have continued along the Sole Thrust after this time, and late, out-566 \nof-sequence movement along the Moine Thrust may also post-date this intrusion.  567 \nDeformed metagranites within Moine metasedimentary rocks to the NE of the Assynt 568 \nCulmination were emplaced and penetratively deformed during NW-directed, 569 \nforeland-propagating ductile thrusting and nappe assembly.  These yield ion 570 \nmicroprobe zircon ages (Kinny et al. 2003) ranging from 429 \u00b1 11 Ma (Strathnaver 571 \ngranite) to 420 \u00b1 6 Ma (Klibreck granite).  The Klibreck granite appears to be 572 \nanomalously young if ductile deformation within the Moine Thrust Zone ceased by 573 \n429.2 \u00b1 0.5 Ma.  However, on closer analysis, the Klibreck granite ion probe data 574 \nshows clear evidence for Pb-loss (as is the case with the Strathnaver granite; Kinny et 575 \nal. 2003).  It is therefore probably the case that the true age of the Klibreck granite is 576 \n 19\nolder than the weighted mean 206Pb\/238U  age of 420 \u00b1 6 Ma, and may lie closer to the 577 \nupper intercept of a regression line passed through the data, indicating an age of 430 \u00b1 578 \n11 Ma. 579 \nA metagranite sampled from within the Moine rocks north-east of Assynt, with thrust-580 \nrelated ductile deformation, has yielded an ion microprobe zircon age of 415 \u00b1 6 Ma 581 \n(Alsop et al. 2010).  While this sample has less systematic evidence for Pb-loss, the 582 \ndata are rather scattered. Verification of the published age would be desirable in order 583 \nto test the evidence for ductile deformation after 415 Ma. 584 \nThe revised ages presented here for the Glen Dessarry and Loch Ailsh plutons, and 585 \nfor the Canisp Porphyry, demonstrate the pitfalls involved in interpretation of zircon 586 \ndata that is even slightly discordant.  Clearly, unambiguous discrimination between 587 \nevents that occurred within a few million years (e.g. intrusion of the early and late 588 \nsyenites of Assynt) requires precise, concordant zircon data with minimal Pb-loss, 589 \nsuch that 206Pb\/238U  ages can be used with confidence, thereby avoiding the inherent 590 \nbias in 207Pb\/206Pb ages due to uncertainty in common Pb corrections and the 235U 591 \ndecay constant.   592 \nOn the basis of Rb-Sr dating of muscovites in Moine mylonites, Freeman et al. (1998) 593 \nsuggested that transfer of displacement from the ductile Moine Thrust to the 594 \nunderlying thrusts occurred at c. 430 Ma; this conclusion is corroborated by the new 595 \ndata presented here. More difficult to explain are the suggestions that thrusting 596 \ncontinued until c. 408 Ma to the south of Assynt (Freeman et al. 1998), and until c. 597 \n413 Ma further north (Dallmeyer et al. 2001). It is known that, in southern Assynt, the 598 \nMoine Thrust was reactivated at a late stage in the history of the thrust zone, by a 599 \ncomponent of largely brittle movement (Coward, 1983, 1985) and this reactivation 600 \nmay explain some of the younger ages in this area; the dates presented in the present 601 \npaper do not provide a constraint on the age of this brittle reactivation. However, the 602 \nRb-Sr data of Freeman et al. (1998) from south of Assynt require that micas with 603 \nindistinguishable phengite chemistry crystallised at very similar depths over a period 604 \nof c. 21 Ma during active thrusting.  This seems geologically improbable, and it seems 605 \nmore likely that their ages, which are defined by statistically poorly constrained two-606 \npoint isochrons, are rendered inaccurate by the use of bulk feldspar separates rather 607 \nthan microsampling of synkinematic overgrowths to constrain initial ratios (which 608 \nwas not technically feasible at the time).  Notably, the feldspar analyses of Freeman et 609 \n 20\nal. (1998) show considerable variation (and indeed, scatter around a trend with an 610 \n\u2018age\u2019 of c. 920 Ma).  611 \nThe total amount of displacement on the Glencoul and Ben More thrusts is estimated 612 \nat c. 50 km (Elliott and Johnson 1980). This displacement occurred between the 613 \nemplacement of the Loch Ailsh Pluton and the late suite of the Loch Borralan Pluton, 614 \na period of 2.2-0.6 Ma, taking into account the errors. This would suggest a 615 \nmovement rate of between 20 and 80 mm per year. Although the upper end of this 616 \nspectrum is rather high, the lower end accords well with known modern slip rates in 617 \nthe Himalaya (20 mm\/yr; Mugnier et al. 2004) and New Zealand (30 mm\/year; Norris 618 \nand Cooper 1997). It should be noted that Scandian orogenesis in general was 619 \nrelatively rapid, and associated with fast, but realistic, plate motions (Dewey & 620 \nStrachan 2003). 621 \nIn the Scandinavian Caledonides, pre- to syn-tectonic subduction-related magmatism 622 \noccurred at 445 \u2013 435 Ma (Corfu et al. 2006), but the main collisional stages took 623 \nplace between 430 \u2013 400 Ma (Tucker et al., 2004). In Greenland, syn-tectonic 624 \nmagmatism is dated at 430 \u2013 425 Ma (Strachan et al., 2001; Andresen et al. 2007), but 625 \nplate convergence is known to have continued through the Devonian (Dallmeyer et al. 626 \n1994; Gilotti & McClelland 2007). This contrasts with the new evidence, presented 627 \nhere, that the Scandian collisional event in Scotland was largely completed by c. 429 628 \nMa. With the levels of geochronological precision now achievable, it is possible to 629 \nrecognise different phases of orogenic activity within the Scandian Event along the 630 \nlength of the Caledonian Orogen.  631 \nConclusions 632 \nThe data presented here constrain the timing of deformation associated with the 633 \nMoine Thrust Zone in the North-west Highlands of Scotland. Early ductile movement 634 \non the Moine Thrust, possibly associated with the formation of the Northern Highland 635 \nSteep Belt, occurred after the emplacement of the Glen Dessarry Pluton at 447.9 \u00b1 2.9 636 \nMa. Movement within the Moine Thrust Zone in Assynt overlapped in space and time 637 \nwith a pulse of syn-tectonic alkaline magmatism, including the Loch Ailsh Pluton, the 638 \nCanisp Porphyry sills, and the early suite of the Loch Borralan Pluton, at 430.7 \u00b1 0.5 639 \nMa. Deformation within the Moine Thrust Zone was completed by the emplacement 640 \n 21\nof the undeformed late suite of the Loch Borralan pluton at 429.2 \u00b1 0.5 Ma. Late 641 \nbrittle movement on the Moine Thrust may post-date this magmatism.   642 \n 643 \nAcknowledgments 644 \nKG, IM, JE and MK publish with the permission of the Executive Director of the 645 \nBritish Geological Survey.

    \n (a) z1, z2, t1 etc. are labels for fractions composed of single zircon grains (z) or titanite fractions (t); all zircons were annealed and chemically abraded after Mattinson (2005). \n(b) Nominal fraction weights estimated from photomicrographic grain dimensions, adjusted for partial dissolution during chemical abrasion. \n(c) Nominal U and total Pb concentrations subject to uncertainty in photomicrographic estimation of weight and partial dissolution during chemical abrasion. \n(d) Model Th\/U ratio calculated from radiogenic 208Pb\/206Pb ratio and 207Pb\/235U age. \n(e) Pb* and Pbc represent radiogenic and common Pb, respectively. \n(f) Measured ratio corrected for spike and fractionation only. \n(g) Corrected for fractionation, spike, and common Pb; up to 2 pg of common Pb was assumed to be procedural blank: 206Pb\/204Pb = 18.50 \u00b1 0.50%; 207Pb\/204Pb = 15.59 \u00b1 0.32%;   208Pb\/204Pb = \n38.02 \u00b1 0.50% (all uncertainties 1-sigma).  Excess over blank was assigned to initial common Pb. \n(h) Errors are 2-sigma, propagated using the algorithms of Schmitz and Schoene (2007) and Crowley et al. (2007). \n(i) Calculations are based on the decay constants of Jaffey et al. (1971). 206Pb\/238U and 207Pb\/206Pb ages corrected for initial disequilibrium in 230Th\/238U using Th\/U [magma] = 3. \n(j) Corrected for fractionation, spike, and blank Pb only. \n"}
