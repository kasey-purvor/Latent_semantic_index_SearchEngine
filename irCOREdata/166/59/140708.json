Introduction\nBiosensor research represents an ever growing field of interest, with increasing\nnumbers of sensors being marketed commercially over the last 15 years [1-7]. Further\ndevelopments in membrane technology have helped to maintain a sustained interest in\nthe area of amperometric membrane based sensors [8-10].\nWhen measuring whole blood samples, two problems must be overcome:\nFirstly interferents that may be present in the blood (such as ascorbate) must be\nprevented from reaching the electrode since they can be oxidised and give rise to\nerroneous readings. Secondly physiological fluids, especially blood, also have a\ntendency to deposit materials such as proteins, usually irreversibly, onto solid\nsurfaces. This biofouling process can diminish the response of sensors \u2013 and in some\ncases can passivate them completely. One approach is to employ two separate\nfunctional membranes [11]. An outer membrane is provided to act as a substrate\ndiffusion limiting barrier as well as to provide favourable biocompatibility [12]. An\nunderlying (inner) membrane is also employed as a permselective barrier [13] and is\ntypically positioned immediately over the working electrode to screen out interferents.\nUnfortunately both membranes act as additional diffusional barriers through which\nthe enzyme substrates and\/or H2O2 must traverse, so hindering their passage to the\nenzyme or working electrode - this frequently increases the overall response time.\nThis has lead to research towards the development of single multi-functional\nultra thin film composite membranes [14,15]. Membranes of this type have been\nshown to be capable of serving as both highly substrate diffusion limiting barriers\ntowards enzyme substrates, whilst also effectively screening anionic interferents from\nthe working electrode via a charge exclusion principle [16]. The usual method for\nformation of composite membranes of this type is to deposit a homogeneous film\n(ideally 100nm thickness) of a biocompatible polymer onto a highly porous support\nmembrane, which offers mechanical support to the structure. Amperometric glucose\noxidase laminate enzyme electrodes employing such biocompatible composite\nmembranes have been found to display shortened response times [17].\nIt should be noted in this context that the separational performance of a\nhomogeneous polymer film membrane relies on its chemical properties and not on its\nthickness per se, whereas the rate at which the separation can occur is dependent on\n3the thickness of the membrane. It therefore follows that the thinner a membrane is, the\nbetter will be its performance also. On the other hand it should be appreciated that if a\nmembrane is made too thin, it will become excessively fragile and thus be rendered\nuseless. A membrane of substantially reduced thickness which could offer the\nrequired separational performance, whilst still possessing the mechanical strength of a\nconventional contemporary membrane, would therefore clearly be highly\nadvantageous.\nVarious methods exist for the manufacture of membranes of this type, with\none of the most applicable being that of electrodeposition of either a conducting or\nnon-conducting polymer, the use of which within biosensors has been reviewed [18].\nElectrodeposition affords the possibility of accurate control of the location and\nthickness of a deposited polymer film. The active species e.g. an enzyme is\nincorporated within the polymeric film [18].\nPrevious work within our group combined the use of an active layer such as a\nchemically crosslinked film of glucose oxidase - which is either (i) directly deposited\nonto or (ii) laminated to a supported electro-deposited membrane at an electrode\nsurface. Once deposited, this active layer is then covered with the permselective\ncomposite membrane which both screens out interferents and offers favourable\nbiocompatibility. Our work initially utilised highly porous commercial alumina\nmembranes as supports for ultra-thin polydivinylbenzene\/ethylvinylbenzene\n(DVB\/EVB) or polyacrylonitrile films [19, 20]. The DVB\/EVB system was found to\nbe especially suitable, giving increased linearity of glucose response, good exclusion\nof ascorbate and favourable biocompatibility [19]. The alumina support membranes\nwere, however, somewhat inflexible and brittle. The next phase of this work was\nfocussed towards developing this sensor further by increasing its mechanical\nflexibility and so increasing the possible scope of application within sensors for\npractical applications. A sensor that can withstand greater manipulation would in\nparticular allow for the production of different future cell designs. This lead to the\ndevelopment of a glucose sensor containing a permselective membrane based on\ncommercial polyester membranes [21] - which besides their improved physical\nproperties displayed improved biocompatibility, stability and accuracy in responses in\ncomparison to similar enzyme electrodes employing alumina membranes.\n4Ever since La Roche produced the first lactate sensor, (the \u201cLactate Analyser\nLA640\u201d) in 1975, research has continued in this area. Within clinical analysis and\nbiotechnology, glucose and lactate are two of the enzyme substrates that are most\noften determined at this present time [22].\nLactate is widely distributed within blood, muscle tissue and body fluids and\nis an important parameter within both sports medicine and clinical care [23]. For\nexample, the monitoring of lactate levels is useful in high dependence care units and\nduring surgery, since the determination of lactate levels may provide early detection\nof clinical shock and therefore this approach helps to minimise metabolic stress [24].\nThe monitoring of patient lactate levels is particularly important when conditions such\nas myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, pulmonary\nedema, septacemia or haemorrage have been diagnosed [25]. These conditions result\nin an inadequate cardiac output, causing a decrease in blood pressure. The limited\nblood flow then causes the circulatory system to deteriorate, which in turn reduces the\ncardiac output further, causing a vicious cycle that leads to 85% of patients who\ndevelop cardiogenic shock not surviving [26]. The poor available supply of oxygen to\nshocked tissue diminishes the oxidative metabolism and results in acidosis. When this\noccurs the cells must obtain their energy by the anaerobic process of glycolysis, which\ncauses excessive quantities of lactic acid to be released into the bloodstream. In\naddition to this, the poor blood flow through the tissues limits the removal of carbon\ndioxide from the blood, which reacts with water to form very high concentrations of\nintracellular carbonic acid, and so the condition acidosis. Early detection of these\nexcessive levels of blood lactate may therefore prove crucial to a patient\u2019s survival.\nNormal physiological measurements of lactate within whole blood range between 0-2\nmM, whilst levels of lactate found in a patient suffering from this type of shock rarely\nexceed 20 mM [27].\nThe use of lactate sensors within sports medicine is also widely used to\nmonitor fitness as well as to detect injury to tissues and even thrombosis [28]. Lactate\nsensors also allow an athlete to monitor the success of their training by determining\nthe muscles\u2019 anaerobic threshold during physical exercise [23]. Actively contracting\nmuscles obtain energy in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) from glucose\nstored in the bloodstream and the breakdown of glycogen stored in the muscles. The\nbreakdown of glucose initially produces pyruvic acid, which, when mixed with\noxygen is converted to carbon dioxide, water and ATP. If the muscles are contracting\n5vigorously for long periods of time, however, the circulatory system begins to become\ndiminished of oxygen. Under such anaerobic conditions, the pyruvic acid produced\nvia the breakdown of glucose is converted to lactic acid, which leaks out of the\nmuscles into the blood stream and is carried around the body.\nDuring normal cellular respiration, with only moderate physical exertion, the\nenzyme lactate oxidase (LOD) acts as a catalyst for the oxidation of lactate back to\npyruvate and the flow of oxygen to muscle cells is generally sufficient to prevent this\nbuild up of lactate and so prevent cramp. If, however, the oxygen supply remains\ndiminished, the functioning of the body becomes impaired and the muscles fatigue\nvery quickly.\nAs soon as oxygen becomes available again, the lactic acid is reconverted to\npyruvic and then into carbon dioxide, water and ATP. Given that high levels of lactate\nwithin the bloodstream are detrimental to an athlete\u2019s performance, many undergo\nendurance training in an attempt to enable the body to perform at a greater pace with a\nminimal amount of lactate production. This kind of training requires the monitoring of\nlactate levels in blood up to concentrations of 22 mM [23, 28].\nLactate analysis is also widely used within the food industry. It is useful for\nevaluating food freshness and stability of milk, dairy products, fruits, vegetables,\nsausages and wines [28]. Lactate is a major metabolite of bacterial energy metabolism\nand is produced during the anaerobic fermentation of glucose and other carbohydrates\n[29]. The conversion of pyruvate to lactate by bacteria within milk produces yoghurt\nand many cheeses and also helps create pickled foods, soy sauce, dough breads and\neven chocolate.\nA sensor utilising the flexible ultra-thin polyDVB\/EVB-coated membranes\ndescribed earlier [21] could produce reliable results for all types of lactate sensor\ndescribed above. The advantages of this system over many of the other types of\nsensors reported are the control of membrane thickness conferred by electrochemical\ndeposition and the flexibility of the resultant glucose sensor. These membranes have\nalready been shown to exclude ascorbate interference and when utilised to measure\nglucose in whole blood samples, to confer excellent haemocompatibility. Results from\nthese sensors have been shown to correlate with standard hospital tests for glucose\nwith a high degree of accuracy [21]. The flexibility of the composite membranes,\nhowever, would be most advantageous towards the development of a flexible sensor\nfor use in sport science. As described earlier, the flexibility of the sensor could allow\n6a lactate sensor to be produced in the form of a sticking plaster, to determine lactate\nlevels within sweat upon the surface of an athlete\u2019s skin.\nThis paper therefore describes the fabrication of a range of\npolyDVB\/EVB-coated membranes (coated via 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 voltammetric cycles)\nand their incorporation within a lactate oxidase sensor. The permeability coefficients\nfor the range of polymer-coated membranes towards the enzyme substrates were\ninvestigated, along with the membranes\u2019 effects on response linearity and screening of\nelectroactive interferents.\n2. Experimental\n2.1 Reagents and Membranes\nN\u2019N-dimethylformamide, tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (electrochemical grade)\nand divinylbenzene (70-85% DVB, 15-30% 3- and 4- EVB, containing 0.1%\npolymerisation inhibitor: 4-tert-butylcatechol) were all purchased from Fluka\nChemicals (Dorset, England).\nDisodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4), sodium dihydrogen phosphate\n(NaH2PO4) and sodium chloride (NaCl) were all obtained from BDH (Poole, Dorset).\nLactate oxidase from Pedicoccus species (20-40 units\/mg solid), L-lactic acid (lithium\nsalt) bovine serum albumin (fraction V) and glutaraldehyde (grade II, 25% aqueous\nsolution) were all purchased from the Sigma Chemical Company (Poole Dorset, UK).\nAluminium oxide Chromatography Grade was obtained from F.S.A.\nLaboratory Supplies (Loughborough, UK). Granular calcium hydride was purchased\nfrom Fisher Scientific (Leicestershire, UK).\nElectrolube \u00ae silver conductive paint (Electrolube\u00ae Ltd, Berkshire) was\npurchased from Maplins Electronics, Manchester, UK and used for the fabrication of\nAu counter electrodes.\nCycloporeTM 0.4 \u00b5m polyester membranes, were purchased from Whatman\nInternational, Maidstone, UK. 0.015\u00b5m pore diameter polycarbonate membranes\n(Poretics Corporation, Livermore, USA) were used as the lower membranes within\nenzyme\/membrane laminates [17].\n72.2 Buffers and Solutions\nA phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) comprising 5.28 x 10-2 M Na2HPO4, 1.3 x 10-3 M\nNaH2PO4 and 5.1 x 10-3 M NaCl in deionised water was used for the preparation of all\nsolutions for diffusion chamber mass transport investigations and lactate calibration\nmeasurements.\n2.3 Preparation of Conductive faced Membrane Electrodes and Counter Electrodes\nIn order to electropolymerise the DVB\/EVB monomer onto the host membranes, the\nuppermost surface was first rendered electrically conductive by Au sputter coating the\nmembranes with an Edwards S150 B sputter coater in a similar manner as used for\nelectron microscopy sample preparation [16]. The gold-coated membranes were then\nattached to multicore wires using fluxless solder and were then used as working\nelectrode assemblies for the electrochemical preparation of thin polymer film\ncomposite membranes.\nGold counter electrodes were constructed by coating glass slides in a similar\nmanner and attaching multicore wires via the application of \u2018Electrolube\u2019 silver\nconductive paint. A further coating of epoxy resin served to insulate the\nwire\/electrode joint, whilst also enhancing the mechanical strength of the electrode.\n2.4 Removal of Polymerisation Inhibitor present in as-received Divinylbenzene\nPrior to the polymerisation of the divinylbenzene, the polymerisation inhibitor (4-tert\nbutylcatechol) was removed from the as-received monomer as previously described\n[19]. It must be noted, however, that the monomer preparation consisted of a mixture\nof 70-85% divinylbenzene plus 0.1% polymerisation inhibitor with the rest of solution\nconstituting 3- and 4-ethylvinylbenzene. Since no attempt was made to separate the\nDVB from the EVB, the resulting polymer films obtained are copolymers of the two\nstyrenic monomers.\nThe as-received DVB\/EVB was extracted 10 times with 5% aqueous sodium\nhydroxide to remove the 4-tert-butylcatechol. The extract produced was washed six\ntimes with high purity de-ionised water and then passed through a column of neutral\n8activated aluminium oxide onto granular calcium hydride. The inhibitor free\ndivinylbenzene was then stored at 4oC over calcium hydride prior to use.\n2.5 Electrodeposition of polyDVB\/EVB onto Polyester Host Support Membranes\nSolutions of monomer (70% v\/v) in N\u2019N-dimethylformamide containing 0.12M\nelectrolyte tetra-n-butyl ammonium perchlorate were degassed for 20 minutes using\npurified nitrogen prior to polymerisation. The electropolymerisation of DVB\/EVB\nonto gold-coated polyester membranes was achieved via the same method described\nearlier [21]: i.e. by cyclically scanning the working electrode potential from 0 V\nthrough to -4.0 V and back to the starting potential (vs. Ag) at a scan rate of 50 mVs-1.\nPolymer-coated membranes were produced via 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 potential cycles.\n2.6 Enzyme Laminate Fabrication\nLactate oxidase was immobilised within an enzyme laminate for the detection of\nlactate concentrations in phosphate buffer. The laminate was prepared as follows:\nLactate oxidase (40 units ml-1) and bovine serum albumin (0.1mg ml-1) were\ndissolved in (pH 7.4) phosphate buffer to form a LOD\/BSA solution. 6\u00b5l of this\nsolution was then added to 3\u00b5l glutaraldehyde (0.5% v\/v in buffer) mixed rapidly and\nplaced on a 1cm2 portion of (0.015\u00b5m pore) polycarbonate membrane. A 1cm2 portion\nof the thin-polymer-film composite membrane (polymer film uppermost) was then\nplaced on top of the enzyme\/albumin matrix and the enzyme membrane laminate\ncompressed under gentle finger pressure for approximately 5 minutes to allow\ncrosslinking of the protein and thus immobilisation of the enzyme. The enzyme\nlaminate was then positioned over the working electrode of a modified Rank oxygen\nelectrode [13] such that the polymer-coated surface faced uppermost (Figure 1b).\n2.7 Enzyme electrode glass cell for lactate determinations\nA bespoke glass electrochemical cell was utilised as before [19,20], Figure 1c, for\nenzyme electrode lactate determinations. This glass cell consisted of two halves\nclamped together. The base was constructed with a flat circular surface, at the centre\nof which was a platinum working electrode of 2mm diameter. The polymer coated\n9composite membrane laminate was positioned over the platinum electrode of the cell\n(polarised at +650mV vs. Ag\/AgCl) and sealed in place with an \u2018O-ring\u2019 to follow the\ndetection of H2O2. The upper half of the cell acted as a chamber into which solutions\nand reference and counter electrodes were introduced. A circular hole in the base of\nthis served to expose the underlying working electrode to the solution. A further\ncircular indentation was made in the underside surface of the solution well to house\nthe O-ring. A silver electrode was placed vertically into the main chamber of the cell\nto act as a combined counter and reference electrode. The enzyme laminate was\npositioned over the Pt working electrode with the polymer-coated surface positioned\nuppermost.\n2.8 Investigation into Solute Permeability Coefficients\nThe mass transport, and therefore permeability coefficients, of both oxygen and\nlactate across a range of ultra-thin polymer composite membranes were determined\nusing conventional diffusion chamber apparatus as previously described [13]. A Rank\nOxygen Electrode assembly (as previously described [13]) was used for the\ndetermination of oxygen levels within solution, whilst a lactate enzyme electrode (as\ndescribed above), was fabricated for the determination of lactate levels.\n3. Results\n3.1 The Electrodeposition of polyDVB\/EVB onto Polyester Host Support Membranes\nThe electropolymerisation of DVB\/EVB onto gold-coated polyester membranes was\nachieved via the same method described earlier [21]. Polymer-coated membranes\nwere produced via 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 potential cycles.\nThe surface topography of polyDVB\/EVB-coated polyester membranes was\ninvestigated and described in our earlier paper [21]. Membranes were found to exhibit\na \u2018pitted\u2019 topography following the first few potential cycles, due to the critical\ngel-point being reached earlier than on the surface, as the concentration of soluble\npolymer was present in the pores was greater. Since the membranes incorporated\nwithin this lactate oxidase sensor are identical to those employed within the glucose\noxidase sensor described earlier [21], the film thickness has been calculated via\ncharge integration to be approximately 50 nm for a 10 layer film.\n10\n3.2. Enzyme Immobilisation\nThe prototype sensor described in this chapter was designed to electrochemically\nquantify levels of lactate concentrations via the amperometric detection of hydrogen\nperoxide produced by the enzyme lactate oxidase (LOD):\n22\nLOD\n2 OHpyruvateOlactateL \uf02b\uf0be\uf0be \uf0ae\uf0be\uf02b\uf02d\nLOD has previously been shown to remain active for up to 21 days (from an\ninitial activity of 42.4 \uf06dM H2O2\/min\/mg to approx. 5 \uf06dM H2O2\/min\/mg), when\nimmobilised within a crosslinked within a gel of bovine serum albumin with\nglutaraldehyde [22]. The rigid matrix formed in this way also adheres to both\nunderlying and upper membranes to produce an enzyme laminate. The LOD enzyme\ndescribed in the chapter was therefore immobilised in this way.\n3.3. The Determination of Permeability Coefficients\nThe Permeability coefficients, (P), for lactate and oxygen through polymer-coated\npolyester membranes were obtained as described above. Figure 2a depicts the\npermeability coefficients for lactate across a membrane coated with polyDVB\/EVB\nvia 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 potential cycles, whilst Figure 2b depicts the P coefficients for\noxygen.\nThe P values for lactate across polyDVB\/EVB-coated polyester membranes\n(Figure 2a) decreased most markedly following the first potential cycle, after which\npoint they tend towards a plateau. This would indicate that the membrane pores\nbecome blocked at this point, however, this may not be the case since the P values for\noxygen indicate that it is after the second potential that the mass transport of oxygen\nmolecules through the membrane is most greatly hindered (Figure 2b).\nThe oxygen P values were found to decrease as each successive polymer was\napplied and the underlying membrane became increasingly coated with layers of\npolymer. The greatest decrease in the mass transport of oxygen through the membrane\n11\nwas found to occur following the initial first and second potential cycles, after which\npoint the P values decrease at a reduced rate.\nThe difference in P values between lactate and oxygen can initially be\nexplained by the larger lactate molecule meeting increased resistance to the\ndiminishing pore size following the first potential cycle. Our earlier papers [19-21]\ndescribe how the smaller oxygen molecule may still be able to diffuse through any\nsmall pinhole areas of the pores that remain unblocked after the first cycle, whereas\nthe lactate begins to partition through the polymer film itself. Following the\napplication of the second potential, however, both substrates begin to use partitioning\nas their mode of transport.\nOnce all membrane pores are blocked, however, molecular size may no longer\nbe important and both substrates must partition across the polymer barrier. We have\nalready seen that the O2 permeability decreases significantly after the second initial\npolymer layer has been deposited and then continues to decrease gradually further\nwith each successive layer deposited, implying that partitioning becomes the\nincreasing mode of mass transport for O2 across the membrane, Figure 2b. The\ngreatest decrease in lactate permeability on the other hand, occurs following the first\npolymer coatings, Figure 2a; at this point the lactate must now also partition through\nthe composite membrane. Following 10 potential cycles, the lactate permeability\ncoefficient reaches a minimum as the polymer film at this point is at its thickest. The\ngradual decrease in both lactate and oxygen permeability as each successive coating is\napplied may be due to either a) an increased resistance being offered to a larger\nmolecule as it partitions across the polymer, or b) a possible residual \u2018pin-hole effect\u2019.\nEarlier SEM studies [21] suggested that, although not visible at the surface,\nthe vast majority of the membrane pores have some amount of polymer formed within\nor across them after 2 potential cycles. Since it is following these first few potential\ncycles that membrane pores become blocked, successive potential cycles therefore\ncontribute to the cumulative thickness of solid polymer formed, resulting in\nincreasingly lowered P values.\nPrevious studies employing thin-polymer-film composite membranes as the\nupper covering membrane within glucose sensors have shown that, in this context,\nmembranes exhibiting lower glucose\/oxygen P ratios are associated with extended\nsensor response linearity ranges [19-21]. It therefore follows that lowered\n12\nlactate\/oxygen P ratios would also contribute to greater linearity of response and so\nthese values were calculated and are depicted in Figure 2c.\nP ratio values are seen to decrease slightly following the first potential cycle,\nsince the larger lactate molecule first meets an initial increased resistance as the first\nelectrodeposition of polyDVB\/EVB decreases the pore diameter. P ratio values are\nthen seen to rise again slightly, with the second potential cycle. Individual P values\nfor both substrates have indicated that it is within the first two cycles that the polymer\nblocks the membrane pores. Following the second potential cycle, however, the P\nratio values continue to decrease gradually with each successive polymer coating\napplied.\nFigure 2c shows that lactate\/O2 P ratios fall for the membrane coated via 5\npotential cycles to values approaching those seen at membranes coated with one or no\npolymer layers. The permeability coefficients, of course, for both solutes, however,\nare lower. The P ratios are seen to increase following the tenth potential cycle,\nhowever, a characteristic also observed for glucose\/oxygen P ratios in our previous\nwork on glucose sensors [21]. This was attributed to a slight deterioration in the\nuniformity of the polymer-coated membrane surface following multiple potential\ncycles [21]. For this reason, the prototype lactate oxidase enzyme electrode was\nconstructed by utilising a polyDVB\/EVB-coated composite membrane coated via 5\npotential cycles as the upper covering barrier.\n3.4. Calibration and Comparison of a Range of Lactate Sensors Incorporating\nFlexible Thin-Film PolyDVB\/EVB Composite Membranes\nA range of lactate oxidase enzyme electrodes was constructed, with each electrode\nemploying a flexible composite membrane produced via 1, 2, 3, 5 or 10 potential\ncycles. Calibration curves were obtained over a concentration range of 0mM to 25mM\nlactate in phosphate buffer (Figure 3). All membranes served as effective limiting\nbarriers to the diffusion of both the enzyme substrates and the responses to normal\nphysiological concentrations found in human whole blood (0-2mM) were found to be\nlinear for all membranes. With each polymer coating deposited, the amperometric\nresponses became increasingly linearised and response times for all sensors were\nfound to be <1 minute.\n13\n3.5. Exclusion of Electroactive Interferents Present In Human Whole Blood\nAn ultra-thin polyDVB\/EVB composite membrane coated via 5 potential cycles was\nemployed as the upper covering membrane in the enzyme electrode. The sensor\ndescribed within this chapter is initially aimed towards the detection of lactate within\nwhole blood for use within clinical emergency situations, e.g. to monitor the\nconditions of shock experienced by a patient. The possibility of utilising the\nultra-thin-composite membranes within a sensor designed for in-vivo analyses or\nwithin whole blood in vitro, requires that the membranes permit effective screening of\nelectroactive interferents that may be present in blood. In the same way, that the effect\nof anionic interferents such as ascorbate were investigated for the glucose sensors\ndescribed earlier [19-21], the lactate sensor produced was also assessed for its\npossible capabilities for screening interferents. What is of interest is that the exclusion\ncannot be solely on the basis of charge exclusion or lactate itself would be unable to\ncross the composite membrane. Our previous work [21] has shown that glucose\npasses more slowly through these membranes than the much smaller oxygen\nmolecule, therefore it appears that a combination of size and charge exclusion\nminimises the passage of ascorbate. Also for interference to occur, ascorbate would\nhave to cross the entire membrane to be reduced at the electrode whereas lactate will\nbe oxidised within the membrane and produce hydrogen peroxide which is uncharged.\nThe enzyme electrode was therefore evaluated for its ability to screen anionic\ninterferents as described earlier described earlier [19-21] and was exposed to lactate\nboth in the absence and presence of 1mM ascorbate. It was found that the enzyme\nelectrode response was not significantly affected by the presence of ascorbate until a\nconcentration of 20mM lactate was exceeded. The response was found to increase by\n10nA following the addition of 20mM lactate with ascorbate and 10nA for 30mM\nlactate with ascorbate. This increase in response may be due to the production at high\nlactate concentrations of high levels of pyruvic acid and hydrogen peroxide by the\nenzyme. Previous researchers [30] have reported the facile reaction between pyruvate\nand hydrogen peroxide to give acetate, water and carbon dioxide, which is acidic\n(pKa = 6.1) and in sufficiently large quantities could lower the enzyme electrode\u2019s net\nanionic charge and allow anionic interferents to reach the working electrode more\nfreely. Since the typical concentration range of lactate found within blood is between\n14\n0mM and 2mM, these results therefore demonstrate that for physiological lactate\nanalyses, the sensor proves to be effective at screening electroactive interferents.\nThe membrane described here for use within a lactate sensor employed the\nsame membranes described earlier [21] and SEM images depicting the surfaces of\nboth the bare flexible polyester membrane, and the polyDVB\/EVB-coated membrane\nfollowing exposure to whole human blood for 2 hours, showed that both coated and\nuncoated surfaces offered favourable haemo\/biocompatibility [21].\n4. Conclusions\nFlexible ultra-thin-polyDVB\/EVB composite membranes have been electrochemically\nfabricated and successfully employed as the outer covering barrier in a model lactate\noxidase sensor for the determination of lactate.\nCyclically scanning the working electrode potential between 0 V and \u20134.0 V\n(vs. Ag) via 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 cycles produced a range of composite membranes.\nDiffusion chamber experiments were performed to determine the permeability\ncoefficients of lactate and oxygen across the range of membranes. As the pores of the\nunderlying polyester membranes became increasingly blocked by polymer, the lactate\nand O2 P values decreased as both solutes begin to partition through the polymer film\nto reach the enzyme matrix.\nThe composite membranes fabricated were employed as the outer covering\nbarrier in model lactate oxidase sensors for the determination of lactate. Lactate\ncalibration curves were produced for all enzyme electrodes and were found to display\nincreasingly substrate diffusion limiting properties with increasing polymer coatings.\nThe sensors also effectively screened against electroactive interferents via a\ncharge exclusion mechanism. All composite membranes produced linear responses for\nnormal physiological concentrations in human whole blood (0-2mM) and linearity of\nsensor responses was also achieved up to 25mM in some cases. The sensor response\ntime was found to be <1 minute. The underlying polyester membrane proved to act as\na suitably biocompatible support for the polymer film, which also displayed\nfavourable biocompatibility, thereby helping minimise surface biofouling effects.\n15\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC for a PhD studentship for K.
