Given that music is an integral part of group 4 \nexercise classes (e.g. aerobics, circuit training, Spinning\u00ae) there is clearly merit in 5 \nunderstanding how it can influence participant behaviour, feelings and cognitions. 6 \nEvidence suggests that music must be carefully selected to match the requirements of 7 \nboth the activity and the characteristics of the individual or group to have a significant 8 \nimpact on factors such as enjoyment or work output (Atkinson, Wilson, & Eubank, 9 \n2004; Crust & Clough, 2006; Karageorghis, Terry, & Lane, 1999; Priest, et al., 2004). It 10 \nappears that music can influence psychophysical functioning through at least three 11 \nmechanisms: attentional narrowing (dissociation effect), alterations in arousal, and 12 \nsynchronisation (Karageorghis & Terry, 1997). From an applied perspective it is 13 \nimperative that researchers attempt to identify what is the right music for specific 14 \nexercise settings, groups and\/or individuals. The present research aimed to identify the 15 \ncomponents of asynchronous music that circuit training participants perceived to be 16 \nmost important in determining exercise enjoyment, and to evaluate if these perceptions 17 \nwere related to personal factors or emotional reactivity.  18 \n In their conceptual model of motivational asynchronous music (i.e., background 19 \nmusic where there is no conscious effort to synchronise movement with musical tempo), 20 \nKarageorghis et al. (1999) highlight both musical components which determine the 21 \nmotivational qualities of selections and outcomes related to the use of motivational 22 \nmusic. It was proposed that the motivational qualities of music are determined by both 23 \nmusic factors (structural elements inherent to the music) and personal factors that reflect 24 \nindividual interpretations. This model suggests motivational music (music that 25 \n 4\nstimulates or inspires physical activity) can influence levels of arousal, mood, ratings of 1 \nperceived exertion, and subsequently exercise adherence (Karageorghis et al., 1999).  2 \nFour factors are shown to contribute to the motivational qualities of a selection; 3 \nnamely rhythm response, musicality, cultural impact and association. The hierarchical 4 \nstructure of the model identifies music factors as more important than personal factors 5 \nin determining the motivational qualities of selections. Rhythm response represents the 6 \nstimulating qualities of rhythm and tempo, and there is strong support for rhythm 7 \nresponse being the most important component of motivational asynchronous music (cf. 8 \nSimpson & Karageorghis, 2006).  9 \nThe second music factor in the Karageorghis et al. (1999) model, musicality, 10 \nrefers to the response to pitch-related elements such as harmony (how the notes are 11 \ncombined) and melody (tune). Interestingly, Lucaccini and Kreit (1972) proposed that 12 \naffective states were more likely to be altered by harmony and melody, while 13 \nrhythmical factors were proposed to influence bodily responses. Douglas (1985) also 14 \nsuggested that listener interpretation and mood are shaped by factors such as harmony 15 \nand melody, although this aspect of the conceptual model has received little attention.  16 \n Two personal factors (cultural impact and association) are deemed important in 17 \nrelation to the motivational qualities of music. Cultural impact reflects the 18 \npervasiveness of a selection within society, whereas extra-musical associations, such as 19 \nassociations with sport and exercise, are proposed to evoke memories or thoughts that 20 \npromote physical activity. These personal factors were deemed less important than 21 \nmusic factors in determining the motivating qualities of a musical selection.  22 \n Although some researchers have found good support for the hierarchical nature 23 \nof the conceptual model (Atkinson et al., 2004), others have suggested that the relative 24 \nimportance of musical components might vary in relation to personal and task-related 25 \ncharacteristics (Crust & Clough, 2006). Furthermore, recent qualitative research 26 \n 5\n(Bishop, Karageorghis, & Loizou, 2007) concerning the use of music by young tennis 1 \nplayers, found that factors such as extra-musical associations and lyrical content were 2 \nperceived as important in eliciting emotional responses and altering mood and arousal. 3 \nIntuitively it would seem likely that the importance that exercisers attach to rhythmic 4 \ncomponents is going to be greater in activities where the pace of exercise and musical 5 \ntempo are to be synchronised.  6 \n To operationalise their own conceptual model, and to aid the selection of 7 \nmotivational music by researchers and practitioners, Karageorghis et al. (1999) 8 \ndeveloped the Brunel Music Rating Inventory (BMRI). This 13-item inventory 9 \nreportedly possessed adequate psychometric properties, attracted support as a useful aid 10 \nto selecting motivational music (Szabo & Griffiths, 2003), and has since been used in 11 \nnumerous research investigations (Atkinson et al., 2004; Crust, 2004; Crust & Clough, 12 \n2006; Elliot, Carr & Savage, 2004). However, a number of concerns were raised about 13 \nthe BMRI (cf. Crust & Cough, 2006; Karageorghis, Priest, Terry, Chatzisarantis & 14 \nLane, 2006) which related to both the factor structure of the inventory and the validation 15 \nprocess. Research revealed that participants had problems with interpreting specific 16 \nitems on the BMRI such as harmony, and date of release while other items such as chart 17 \nsuccess, were deemed to be irrelevant (Karageorghis et al., 2006b).  18 \n To overcome problems associated with the original BMRI, Karageorghis et al. 19 \n(2006b) developed the BMRI-2, a 6-item inventory that possesses stronger 20 \npsychometric properties and appears to be easier to use and more applicable to exercise 21 \nparticipants. While this development appears promising, there remain concerns in 22 \nrelation to the BMRI-2. Karageorghis et al. (2006b) justify the removal of items relating 23 \nto the personal response to motivating music, due to being inappropriate for objective 24 \nmeasurement. The authors acknowledged the limited scope of the BMRI-2, and 25 \nsuggested that additional qualitative methods might be necessary to aid the optimal 26 \n 6\nselection of motivational music. Karageorghis et al. provided an additional framework 1 \nof criteria that are not explicitly included within the BMRI-2.  2 \nParticipant responses to, and preferences for music are undoubtedly influenced 3 \nby personal factors (cf. Crozier, 1997; Kemp, 1997) and the subjective interpretation of 4 \nmusic. As such, it is unlikely that the effects of music in sport and exercise contexts can 5 \nbe fully evaluated and understood by reducing interpretations to a single numerical 6 \nscore via a 6-item questionnaire such as the BMRI-2. Furthermore, a number of factors 7 \nthat have been rated as highly important in influencing exercise performance, such as 8 \nlyrical content, ability to evoke imagery and extra-musical associations (Gfeller, 1988) 9 \nand factors of theoretical importance such as familiarity (North & Hargreaves, 1997) are 10 \nnot included in the BMRI-2.  11 \n A good deal of effort appears to have been devoted to understanding the \u2018right\u2019 12 \nmusic in relation to tempo, with Karageorghis et al. (1999) proposing that motivational 13 \nmusic is characterised by strong rhythm, and fast tempi of 120 bpm-1 or above. 14 \nHowever, Crust and Clough (2006) encouraged more effort to determine which musical 15 \ncomponents are more important in achieving specific outcomes. Tenenbaum et al. 16 \n(2004) suggested that melody and rhythm were more important than lyrical content in 17 \ndiverting attention from aversive stimuli during high intensity running. These 18 \nresearchers also stressed the importance of personal meaning and personal associations 19 \nin producing distraction from pain.  20 \n  Karageorghis et al. (2006b) suggest that motivational music might influence 21 \nexercise enjoyment and adherence, as well as influencing frequency, intensity and 22 \nduration of exercise behaviour. On this basis, it is possible that the term motivational 23 \nmusic might represent an over-simplification, as it is acknowledged that different 24 \nmusical properties may separately influence mood, attention and arousal (Karageorghis 25 \net al.). It is also possible that music which enhances mood and promotes positive 26 \n 7\naffective states would not necessarily stimulate physical activity (Karageorghis et al.). 1 \nGiven the potential importance of the relationship between enjoyment and exercise 2 \nadherence (Cervone, Kopp, Schaumann & Scott, 1994) there appears to be a need to 3 \nfocus more precisely on the importance of musical properties in promoting increased 4 \nenjoyment, as these are not necessarily the same as the properties of motivational music.  5 \n Little attention has been devoted to the importance of personal factors in the 6 \nextant literature. However, Priest et al. (2004) investigated the influence of gender and 7 \nage, and found female exercisers rated the importance of music more highly than males. 8 \nHowever, in contrast to the previous findings of Karageorghis et al. (1999) women were 9 \nnot found to have a greater preference for the rhythmical components of music. Overall, 10 \nPriest et al. report a trend for females to experience more enhanced affective states as a 11 \nresult of listening to music during exercise. Given that gender differences might also 12 \nexist in relation to the perceived importance of music in exercise settings (Priest et al., 13 \n2004) or to the relative importance men and women attach to various musical factors 14 \n(cf. Karageorghis, 1999), such differences clearly need to be explored. In relation to 15 \nage, Priest et al found older participants preferred quieter and slower music.  16 \n One important factor that has often been overlooked by music psychologists (cf. 17 \nKemp, 1997) and has been shown to influence both musical preferences (Daoussis & 18 \nMcKelvie, 1986; Kemp, 1997) and responsiveness to musical selections (Crust & 19 \nClough, 2006) is personality. Crust and Clough hypothesised that more emotionally 20 \nsensitive individuals would experience stronger responses to musical selections 21 \ncontaining musicality (harmony and melody) than to an edited rhythm response 22 \ncondition of identical tempo that was lacking any harmony or melody. This line of 23 \nreasoning also had theoretical underpinning from music theorists who suggested that 24 \nharmony and melody were likely to influence mood and affective states (Douglas, 1980; 25 \nLucaccini & Kreit, 1972). Results of an isometric weight-holding task supported this 26 \n 8\nhypothesis, with a positive correlation found between sensitivity and responsiveness 1 \n(weight-holding endurance) to the harmonic and melodic aspects of a motivational 2 \npopular music selection. In contrast, more tough-minded (less sensitive) participants 3 \nappeared to be little influenced by musicality factors; for these individuals rhythm 4 \nresponse was most important in determining endurance response. These results 5 \nappeared consistent with the work of Hargreaves and Colman (1981) who found 6 \nindividual differences in adult music listening styles, with some participants 7 \ncharacterised by a more \u2018objective-analytic\u2019 listening style (focus on structure), while 8 \nothers exhibited more \u2018affective\u2019 listening (focus on emotional content).     9 \n There were three aims in the present research: First, to provide a further test of 10 \nthe hierarchical structure of the conceptual model of Karageorghis et al. (1999) by 11 \nestablishing participant perceptions of the importance of musical components. It was 12 \nhypothesised that musical properties that are thought to influence affect (i.e. melody, 13 \nlyrics) would be perceived to be as important as rhythmical components in determining 14 \nexercise enjoyment.  15 \n The second aim of this research was to explore the role of individual 16 \ncharacteristics and specifically the relationship between the importance participants 17 \nattach to musical properties and affect intensity. This construct refers to stable 18 \nindividual differences in response intensity to a given level of emotion-provoking 19 \nstimuli (Larsen, et al., 1986). Individuals high in affect intensity are known to be under-20 \naroused at baseline (Larsen et al., 1986) and have been shown to employ a number of 21 \ncognitive operations (which includes selectively focusing on emotional stimuli) to 22 \namplify emotional responses because of a desire to increase levels of arousal (Larsen, et 23 \nal., 1987). Some researchers such as Cooper and McConville (1993) have questioned 24 \nthe validity of the construct and suggested affect intensity can actually be more 25 \nparsimoniously explained as a mixture of trait neuroticism and extraversion. However, 26 \n 9\nsuch arguments are not convincing given that neuroticism and extraversion together 1 \npredict less than 30% of the variance in measures of affect intensity (cf. Schimmack & 2 \nDiener, 1997). In a series of studies evaluating affective responses to both real and 3 \nhypothetical situations, Schimmack and Diener (1997) provided strong evidence to 4 \nsuggest that affect intensity is a valid construct and cannot be reduced to extraversion 5 \nand neuroticism. Researchers have suggested that music can elicit deep and profound 6 \nemotions within individuals (Hargreaves & North, 1997). Based on this and the research 7 \nfindings of Larsen et al. (1987) it was hypothesised that participants with higher levels 8 \nof affect intensity would rate the musical properties thought to influence affect (melody, 9 \nlyrics etc.) as more important than those with low affect intensity.  10 \n Finally, this research aimed to further explore the role of personal factors such as 11 \ngender and age, which might influence the importance participants give to specific 12 \ncomponents of music. Following the work of Karageorghis et al. (1999), it was 13 \nhypothesised that women (compared to men) would rate rhythmical components of 14 \nmusic as more important for circuit training exercise. In line with Priest et al. (2004) it 15 \nwas proposed that older participants would rate temporal factors as less important than 16 \nyounger participants.   17 \n 18 \nMethod 19 \nParticipants 20 \nThe sample consisted of 55 participants (24 men and 31 women) who all regularly 21 \nattended a weekly circuit training class in the north of England. The age of the 22 \nparticipants ranged from 19 to 68 years, with the mean age of men (38.8, s = 11.8 years) 23 \nfound to be higher than women (32.4, s = 9.6 years). All participants read and signed 24 \ninformed consent forms prior to completing questionnaires. Participant details 25 \nconcerning attendance were collected at the same time as informed consent forms were 26 \n 10\nbeing signed. This research conformed to the ethical guidelines required by York St. 1 \nJohn University\u2019s ethics committee. Only participants who had regularly attended the 2 \nmixed (aerobic and muscular endurance) circuit class for at least 6 months were 3 \nincluded.  4 \n 5 \nInstruments 6 \nMusical Importance 7 \nTo measure the perceived importance of musical components in circuit training, a list of 8 \nitems of theoretical importance were prepared specifically for use in this investigation. 9 \nGiven that this research was aimed at participant perceptions of the general importance 10 \nof musical properties (i.e. rhythm, melody, lyrics) in determining exercise enjoyment 11 \nduring circuit training exercise, it was decided not to use existing instruments that were 12 \ndesigned to measure the motivational qualities of specific selections. The relevance of 13 \nthe 13-items contained within the original BMRI (Karageorghis et al., 1999), the 6-14 \nitems contained in the BMRI-2 (Karageorghis et al., 2006b), and other items which 15 \nreflected important elements of musical selections identified within the literature but not 16 \ncovered in the two stated inventories, were assessed by the author and two circuit 17 \ntraining instructors.  18 \n Given that the content validity of the BMRI-2 has received good support 19 \n(Karageorghis et al., 2006b), it was decided that the six components contained in the 20 \nquestionnaire (rhythm, style, melody, tempo, sound of instruments and beat) would be 21 \nincluded in the present investigation. In a qualitative appraisal of the original BMRI (cf. 22 \nKarageorghis et al., 2006b), participants expressed concerns about a number of items, 23 \nwhich included chart success, date of release, harmony, and danceability. As such, these 24 \nitems were not included in this study. However, Karageorghis et al. (2006b) suggests 25 \nthat other factors which were deemed problematic, were theoretically relevant, and as 26 \n 11\nsuch the following items from the original BMRI are included in this investigation 1 \n(association of music with sport, lyrical content, familiarity, and the artist). Finally, 2 \nprevious researchers and theorists have highlighted the potential importance of (1) 3 \nmusic which generates imagery (Bishop et al., 2007; Gfeller, 1988), (2) music which 4 \nhas personal associations or meaning (Bishop et al; Gfeller; Karageorghis et al., 2006b; 5 \nTenenbaum et al., 2004), and (3) the emotional qualities of music (Bishop et al; Crozier, 6 \n1997; North & Hargreaves, 1997), so these three items were added to the previous ten 7 \nitems to establish 13-items that participants would be required to rate. The content of 8 \nthe questionnaire was discussed and agreed with two circuit training instructors who 9 \nwere Register of Exercise Professionals (REPS) Advanced Level Circuit Training, and 10 \nFitness Training Instructors, who deemed the items to be appropriate in selecting music 11 \nfor circuit training and easily comprehensible.   12 \n In line with other questionnaire-based research into music use in exercise 13 \nsettings (Priest et al., 2004), and consistent with the design of the BMRI-2, a seven-14 \npoint Likert scale with verbal anchors of 1 (not at all important) and 7 (extremely 15 \nimportant) was used for the 13 items in this study. Since previous researchers have 16 \nidentified that non-music experts find it difficult to differentiate between certain musical 17 \nterms such as rhythm and tempo (Karageorghis et al., 2006b), the following definitions 18 \nof musical terms are forwarded which applied in this study: tempo was considered to 19 \nreflect the speed of the music; rhythm referred to the repetitive pattern that occurs 20 \nthroughout the music; and beat referred to the pulse of the music. The written 21 \ninstructions to participants read as follows: 22 \n Take a few moments to think about the music that is played during circuit 23 \n training. Please rate the importance of the following musical factors in relation 24 \n to producing greater enjoyment during circuit training. There are no right or 25 \n 12\n wrong answers: it is your opinion that counts. The factors that you deem most1 \n  important in relation to enjoyment should be given higher ratings. 2 \nAffect Intensity  3 \nTo determine levels of emotional reactivity, the Affect Intensity Measure (AIM- Larsen, 4 \n1984) was completed by each participant. This 40-item inventory assesses the 5 \ncharacteristic intensity with which an individual typically experiences emotions. Items 6 \nare rated on a 6-point scale, with verbal anchors ranging from (1) never, to (6) always, 7 \nwith scoring achieved by averaging the responses across the 40-items. Larsen (1984) 8 \nreported high coefficient alpha (Cronbach, 1951) for the AIM across four samples (\u03b1 \u2265 9 \n0.9). With respect to construct validity, Larsen reported a significant correlation (r = 10 \n0.5, P < 0.01) between Affect Intensity and reports of typical affect response intensity 11 \nby the parents of participants. Tests of stability (test-retest correlations) after 1-, 2-, and 12 \n3 months were found to be 0.8, 0.81 and 0.81 respectively. Larsen et al. (1986) reports 13 \nthat across several samples, the AIM has been found to correlate most consistently with 14 \nsociability, arousability, and emotionality. There is also evidence to suggest that 15 \nparticipants with high affect intensity are under-aroused in quiet, stimulus reduced 16 \nenvironments (Larsen et al., 1986). 17 \n 18 \nProcedures 19 \nThe instructor of a large circuit training class (N > 100) was approached in order to gain 20 \npermission to solicit volunteers. The circuit training class included both cardiovascular 21 \nand muscular endurance exercises focusing on the major muscle groups (i.e. 22 \nabdominals, legs etc.) with 10 stations, and 3-4 exercises per station to allow for 23 \ndifferentiation in ability. Some of the stations used in the circuit class involved the use 24 \nof free weights. This class was deemed appropriate for study because of the use of 25 \nbackground music which was obtained from a specialist music subscription company 26 \n 13\n(i.e., the CDs were representative of music that many other exercise classes would also 1 \nuse). The music played during this circuit training class was of a fast tempo (all 2 \nselections > 120 bpm-1), and included pop, rock and dance music selections. The 3 \ninstructor gave permission for participants to be approached and allowed the author to 4 \naddress the group prior to a circuit training class. Altogether, 55 volunteers agreed to 5 \nparticipate. Participants read, and signed informed consent forms prior to completing a 6 \nbooklet containing a copy of the 13 items relating to musical importance and the AIM 7 \n(Larsen, 1984) questionnaire. Completed booklets were placed into envelopes, sealed 8 \nand collected by the instructor or the author.  9 \n 10 \nData Analysis 11 \nFor the first aim of this study, participant perceptions of the importance of musical 12 \nproperties for exercise enjoyment were rank ordered and compared to the hierarchical 13 \nstructure reported in relation to motivational music (Karageorghis et al., 1999). Second, 14 \na correlation matrix was produced (Pearson correlations) to determine any relationships 15 \nbetween affect intensity, age, and the importance reported for specific musical 16 \nproperties. Pearson correlations were used rather than regression analysis due to the size 17 \nof the sample. Employing a regression analysis, with music items as predictor variables 18 \nand affect intensity as the dependent variable, would have required a significant number 19 \nof additional participants from other circuit training classes. Although this approach 20 \nwould have allowed a more sophisticated statistical analysis of the data, it would also 21 \nlikely have compromised experimental control (i.e. different circuits, exercises, music 22 \nplayed, participant characteristics etc.). Finally, a series of independent t tests were used 23 \nto test for differences in the importance which male and female participants ascribed to 24 \nthe 13 musical components. Tests of normality were conducted to ensure the 25 \nassumptions for use of parametric statistics were met.   26 \n 14\n     1 \nResults 2 \nTable 1 presents the descriptive data for perceived musical importance in relation to 3 \nenjoyment in circuit training exercise. Participants perceived rhythm response 4 \ncomponents (tempo, beat, and rhythm) as being of greatest importance. Other than 5 \nfamiliarity, all other items that represented cultural impact or associations (personal 6 \nfactors) on the original BMRI were rated as being of low importance in relation to 7 \ncircuit training exercise. When normality of the data was assessed using measures of 8 \nskewness and standard kurtosis, two variables; namely perceived importance of beat, 9 \nand perceived importance of rhythm, were found to demonstrate a leptokurtic 10 \ndistribution (kurt.>1.96). Accordingly, these data was not analysed using parametric 11 \nstatistics. In accordance with Priest et al. (2004) who used a similar scale measure of 12 \nimportance of music and also found a leptokurtic distribution, data for these two 13 \nvariables was down-graded to nominal level and gender differences analysed using a 14 \nnon-parametric statistic (chi square). Non-parametric correlations were not performed 15 \nwith these two variables as the data was deemed inappropriate for ranking.   16 \n 17 \nAffect Intensity 18 \nA number of significant Pearson correlations were evident when testing the relationship 19 \nbetween affect intensity and perceived importance of musical components. Affect 20 \nintensity was found to be positively related to perceived importance of melody (r = 21 \n0.33, P < 0.02), musical style (r = 0.38, P < 0.02), lyrical content (r = 0.60, P < 0.001), 22 \npersonal associations (r = 0.29, P < 0.05), and emotional content (r = 0.32, P < 0.02). 23 \nNo differences were found between affect intensity scores for men (M = 3.57, s = 0.40) 24 \nand women (M = 3.81, s = 0.31), and there was no significant relationship found 25 \nbetween affect intensity and age.   26 \n 15\n 1 \nGender  2 \nTo test for differences in the importance men and women ascribed to music 3 \ncomponents, a series of independent t tests were conducted. Significant differences were 4 \nfound for melody (t53 = -2.28, P < 0.05, d = 0.6) and for associations with sport (t53 = 5 \n2.49, P < 0.02, d = 0.7). Women rated melody as significantly more important, while 6 \nmen rated associations with sport of higher importance than did women. No other 7 \nsignificant differences were found in relation to gender.   8 \n 9 \nAge 10 \nThe only significant correlation that was found in regards to age was tempo (r = -0.28, 11 \nP < 0.05). Older participants perceived the tempo of music to be less important than 12 \nyounger exercisers.  13 \n 14 \nDiscussion 15 \nThe first aim of this research was to establish participant perceptions of the importance 16 \nof separate musical components in an activity that does not involve conscious pacing 17 \n(circuit training). This approach allowed a comparison to be made with the hierarchical 18 \nconceptual framework of Karageorghis et al. (1999). The results offer good support for 19 \nthe hierarchical nature of the conceptual framework of Karageorghis et al. (1999), even 20 \nwhen music was rated in relation to exercise enjoyment and not \u2018arousing\u2019 or 21 \nmotivational qualities. Participants clearly emphasised the primary importance of 22 \nrhythmic factors, with tempo, beat and rhythm ranked as most important in determining 23 \nenjoyment. Melody was also rated as highly important to exercise enjoyment, but given 24 \nthe perceived higher importance of rhythmical factors, this offers only limited support 25 \nto the theoretical position adopted by Lucaccini and Kreit (1972), who suggested that 26 \n 16\nmelody and harmony would be most important in determining affective responses. In 1 \ncontrast, factors concerning associations, which Karageorghis et al. (1999) proposed as 2 \nleast important to determining the motivational qualities of music, were also deemed of 3 \nlow importance in this study.  4 \nThese results are consistent with past research that has indicted strong rhythmic 5 \nfactors are most salient when selecting motivational music (Atkinson et al., 2004; 6 \nKarageorghis et al., 2006b; Simpson & Karageorghis, 2006). This is particularly 7 \ninteresting given that in the present research, participants were rating the importance of 8 \nmusical properties in relation to exercise enjoyment and not motivation per se. 9 \nKarageorghis et al. (2006b) did highlight possible problems with the broad term 10 \nmotivational music given the emphasis this definition places on stimulation or arousal, 11 \nwhereas music that enhances mood or affective states might not stimulate physical 12 \nactivity. The present study found no substantive evidence to support these concerns, 13 \nwith those musical properties rated as most important in determining exercise 14 \nenjoyment, clearly corresponding to the most important components of motivational 15 \nmusic (as defined by Karageorghis et al., 1999).  16 \n It is perhaps appropriate to highlight the potential importance of both the 17 \nemotional content of the music and familiarity, with the results of the present study 18 \noffering support to Bishop et al. (2007). Given that music researchers outside of sport 19 \nhave previously stressed the theoretical importance of such components (Crozier, 1997; 20 \nNorth & Hargreaves, 1997; Snyder, 1993), it is necessary for these aspects to be given 21 \nmore consideration in sport and exercise research. Although factors such as familiarity 22 \nand emotional content are difficult to objectively measure, there does appear to be merit 23 \nin further evaluating the role of these components, perhaps most appropriately through 24 \nqualitative approaches. Familiarity appears to be of particular importance in relation to 25 \nthe seminal work of Berlyne (1971), who proposed an inverted \u2018u\u2019 relationship between 26 \n 17\nliking and the arousal potential of music. Berlyne (p. 69) considered variables such as 1 \nfamiliarity, as \u2018most significant\u2019 in relation to liking, and predicted over-familiarity 2 \nwould lead to decreased liking, and that ultimately the music would become less 3 \narousing. This might explain the results of Priest et al. (2004) who found exercise 4 \nparticipants placed great emphasis on variety, perhaps to avoid the decreased arousal 5 \nassociated with over-familiarity. Clearly, more attention is needed to fully understand 6 \nthe role of familiarity and the emotional content of musical selections.  7 \n At present, the influence of gender effects in music research in the sport and 8 \nexercise domain appears unclear. In this study, significant differences were found 9 \nbetween the importance that men and women gave to certain musical components. 10 \nSpecifically, in the context of exercise enjoyment, women rated melody of greater 11 \nimportance than did men, while men reported associations to sport as more important 12 \nthan did women. Interestingly, there were no reported differences in relation to the 13 \nimportance that men and women ascribed to rhythmic factors. This finding offers 14 \nsupport to Priest et al. (2004), who found no evidence to suggest women had a greater 15 \npreference for the rhythmical components of music. In accordance with the 16 \nrecommendations of Priest et al. (2004), there is clearly more research needed to 17 \nunderstand the influence of gender in music and exercise settings.        18 \n In this study, there was a clear trend for older participants to rate musical tempo 19 \nas less important than their younger counterparts. This appears similar to the work of 20 \nPriest (2004), who found older participants to prefer slower and quieter music. In 21 \nrelation to musical preferences, Russell (1997) suggests that age effects have not been 22 \nstudied very systematically, but does report trends for younger people to prefer current, 23 \npopular music. To explore these relationships further, researchers might consider 24 \nemploying longitudinal rather than cross-sectional designs to determine how musical 25 \npreferences in exercise settings develop over time.         26 \n 18\n In attempting to extend the previous work of Crust and Clough (2006), who 1 \nexplored the moderating influence of personality in responsiveness to music, the present 2 \nstudy focused on the importance that participants placed on components of 3 \nasynchronous music by evaluating the role of affect intensity. The findings support the 4 \nhypothesis that participants with higher levels of affect intensity would rate the 5 \ncomponents of music most likely to contain affective information, as more important. In 6 \nrelation to exercise enjoyment, positive correlations between affect intensity and 7 \nmelody, emotional content, personal associations, style, and lyrical content, certainly 8 \nemphasise this relationship, and appear to offer support to the theorising of Lucaccini 9 \nand Kreit (1972). The strongest correlation was evident in relation to lyrical content (r = 10 \n0.60) which suggests higher importance for participants with high affect intensity. Thus, 11 \nwhile lyrical content was generally rated as being of low importance, for some 12 \nparticipants lyrics appear to be far more relevant. These could be very important 13 \nfindings given proposed relationships between enjoyment and exercise adherence 14 \n(Cervone, et al., 1994). From an applied perspective, if exercise leaders are to inspire 15 \ngreater compliance to exercise programmes that incorporate music, then the present 16 \nresearch indicates that the music should be carefully selected to appeal to a wide variety 17 \nof participants. Although evidence of relationships does not determine causality, it is 18 \nlikely that greater sensitivity to factors other than tempo and rhythm is required, along 19 \nwith further research pertaining to the role of personal factors. 20 \n         While the present research offers good support to the conceptual framework of 21 \nKarageorghis et al. (1999), it also highlights some of the important personal factors that 22 \nare likely to be influential in how an individual defines motivational music. Although 23 \nthere is merit in attaining a general understanding of what constitutes motivational 24 \nmusic, especially in regards to meeting the needs of groups of exercisers, much can still 25 \nbe learned from studying the subjective experiences of individuals (Bishop et al., 2007). 26 \n 19\nGiven that interpretations of music are personal and subjective, then it should follow 1 \nthat responses to music are also likely to vary in relation to these interpretations. 2 \nResearch approaches that emphasise personal meaning, such as existential 3 \nphenomenology (cf. Nesti, 2004) are likely to provide more detailed, rich accounts of 4 \nthe effects of music, which will compliment, and perhaps broaden the scope of music 5 \nresearch in sport and exercise. At the very least, such approaches are likely to produce a 6 \nbetter understanding of factors that are difficult to measure objectively (e.g., links to 7 \nimagery, familiarity), and might be used to follow-up on quantitative research findings. 8 \nThe other important reason for examining individual experiences is that although factors 9 \nsuch as pitch and tempo in a musical selection are likely to elicit emotional responses in 10 \nlisteners, the actual emotions involved may vary from person to person (Synder, 1993). 11 \nIn an applied sense, this could also allow for more individualised selections to be 12 \nmatched to the needs of the exerciser.      13 \n There are a number of limitations to the present study that warrant mention. 14 \nFirst, the sample size is relatively small, and reflects the interpretations of one exercise 15 \nclass, and one mode of exercise, so caution is needed in generalising these results. Also, 16 \ngiven the exclusive use of fast music in this particular class, it is possible that the 17 \nassociations exercisers have made with such music might have influenced their 18 \nresponses. It is possible that alternative modes of exercise might result in music factors 19 \nbeing reported as more or less important. In the present study, while music was not 20 \nexplicitly used to cue the rate and precision of movement in circuit training, there 21 \nremains the possibility that some participants were using music as a form of pacing. 22 \nThere are clearly dangers (issues of validity and reliability) in adapting pre-existing 23 \nquestionnaires, and using items from inventories interchangeably. However, neither the 24 \nBMRI or the BMRI-2 appeared to be appropriate (for reasons previously outlined) in 25 \nthis study. The items used in this study were not meant to be considered exhaustive, as 26 \n 20\nfuture research is likely to highlight other important components of music, but all items 1 \ndid have theoretical relevance.  2 \nFinally, the results of this study offer a starting point in considering the 3 \nimportance of musical properties in relation to exercise enjoyment. Few researchers 4 \nhave looked closely at individual components of music (other than rhythm response 5 \nelements), to allow a more detailed understanding of the importance of musical 6 \nproperties. Take the example of the tempo (speed) component. Some individuals 7 \nmotivated by the intensity and duration of exercise sessions, may interpret the 8 \nimportance of tempo as meaning fast tempo while others interpret this in relation to 9 \nmatching the pace of more gentle exercise. This is also a criticism of current 10 \nmeasurement instruments which assess the motivational qualities of selections but don\u2019t 11 \nconsider why individuals rate certain aspects as motivational. The need for more in-12 \ndepth research is clearly illustrated with Karageorghis et al. (in press) actually finding 13 \nmedium (rather than fast) tempo music to be most preferred during treadmill walking. 14 \nThis same principle can be applied to other components such as the style of music, 15 \nwhich are clearly open to individual interpretation (i.e. is style motivational or 16 \nimportant in relation to contextual demands of the exercise or due to personal 17 \npreference?). The application of qualitative methods could help to reveal a more 18 \nthorough understanding of the most important components of motivational music, and 19 \nmore specifically why exercisers rate certain components of music as more important 20 \nthan others.   21 \n 22 \nAcknowledgements 23 \nThe author wishes to thank Mark Sullivan and Dr. Michael Sheard in relation to the 24 \ncollection and analysis of data in this study.  25 \n 26 \n 21\nReferences 1 \nAtkinson, G., Wilson., D., & Eubank, M.
