INTRODUCTION\nLong-lived isomeric states in nuclei are unique laborato-\nries for studying the detailed properties of nuclear wave\nfunctions. From an experimental standpoint, transitions de-\nexciting long-lived isomers provide clean information on\nwave-function admixtures, since a better signal-to-noise ratio\nis achieved if short-lived excitations are allowed to decay\naway. From a theoretical perspective, a long-lived isomeric\nstate is a manifestation of underlying symmetries of the\nnuclear wave function. K isomers ~where K is the projection\nof the total angular momentum of a deformed nucleus onto\nits axis of symmetry! form a special subset that showcases\nthe competition and rich dynamics between collective and\nsingle-particle excitations in a deformed system. In this\nwork, K isomers are used to locate and follow the evolution\nof individual Nilsson states and their couplings in a previ-\nously unexplored neutron-rich region of the nuclear chart\nand provide a groundwork for future exploration of rota-\ntional excitations built on these new isomers.\nHigh-K configurations at low excitation energy abound in\nthe A\u2019180 region of the nuclear chart, where deformed nu-\nclei with axial symmetry have valence nucleons in Nilsson\norbitals with large angular momentum projections on the\nsymmetry axis. The Hf (Z572) isotopes offer an especially\nrobust platform for a systematic study of high-K physics,\nwith rigid axial deformations persisting over a wide range of\nspin and isospin. While yrast high-K isomers have long been\npredicted @1,2# to dominate the excitation spectrum of\nneutron-rich (A.180) Hf nuclei, recent calculations @3# sug-\ngest oblate rotation as a collective mode at high spins.

The recent availability of energetic heavy-ion beams has\nmade it possible to produce high-spin states in the neutron-\nrich Hf nuclei by inelastic excitation and transfer reactions.\nOur earlier work @5,6# documented the population and decay\nof a one-quasiparticle ~1qp! 9\/21 isomer with a half-life of\n80 ms in 181Hf. We report here on new results from a more\nsensitive experiment with improved analysis techniques\nwhich extend the level scheme to 3qp isomers.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nExcitations in 181Hf nuclei were studied at the ATLAS\nfacility at Argonne National Laboratory via the transfer of\none neutron from a beam of 238U at 1585 MeV incident on a\nthick (40 mg\/cm2) enriched 180Hf target backed by Pb\n(50 mg\/cm2). The g and x rays emitted by reaction products\nstopped in the target were detected by 98 Compton-\nsuppressed coaxial Ge and three planar LEPS detectors in the\nGammasphere array. An electrostatic deflector was used to\nsweep the beam on and off. The primary experiment was\nperformed using a beam-sweeping cycle of 8.25 ms on and\n16.5 ms off, with a secondary data set using a 2 ms on and\n4 ms off cycle. Data acquisition was triggered by the first g\nray detected in the \u2018\u2018beam-off\u2019\u2019 period, and data events were\nrecorded from all detectors firing within a time interval of\n\u2019800 ns following each trigger. An \u2018\u2018in-beam\u2019\u2019 data set with\nno beam sweeping was also collected for a short time.\nIII. RESULTS\nThe level scheme of 181Hf deduced in the present work is\nshown in Fig. 1, where all levels and transitions above the\n9\/21 isomer are new.

All delayed transitions placed in the\nlevel scheme were also observed to be in coincidence with\nhafnium x rays.\nHalf-lives of the new isomers were deduced from g-g\nmatrices created for various time slices ~in both the ms and\nms beam-sweeping cycles!. To correct for distortions of the\nrecorded time spectra between the trigger and the beam\nsweeper, the g-g intensities obtained from these matrices\nwere normalized to those of the decay g rays from the t1\/2\n55.5 h isomer in 180Hf, before being fit to exponential de-\ncay functions. The procedure was checked with known half-\nlives ranging from 10 ms @5# to 210 ms @7# in neighboring\nnuclei. Since the half-lives of both new isomers were found\nto be significantly greater than a few ms, the analysis was\nconcentrated on the data set with beam sweeping in the\nms range, which, unfortunately, had considerably lower\nstatistics. Figure 4 shows the normalized intensity for the\n199\u2013499-keV combination from the decay of the upper,\n1738-keV isomer, where a possible two-lifetime behavior is\nobserved. A half-life of 1.5~5! ms was obtained from a least-\nsquares fit to the early part of the time spectrum. The essen-\ntially flat latter part suggests feeding from even higher-lying\nisomers with longer half-lives.

DISCUSSION\nThe primary focus of this experiment was on the decay\nspectroscopy of long-lived isomers, with very little data on\nprompt g rays or on the decay of short-lived levels. The long\nhalf-lives of the isomers preclude any angular distribution\nanalysis, since spin alignments are washed out. Our assign-\nments of g-ray multipolarities and level spins and parities,\ntherefore, rely on intensity balances, branching ratios, and\nsingle-particle half-life estimates, as well as comparisons\nwith expected quasiparticle excitation energies near the yrast\nline. The quantum numbers Jp for the ground state of 181Hf\nare 1\/22, with the valence neutron occupying the\nn@510#1\/22 orbital. As far as 1qp states are concerned, we\nhad established, in our previous work @5#, the n@624#9\/21\nstate at an excitation energy of 595 keV. This level was\nfound to decay primarily to a rotational band built on the\n1\/22 orbital, which we had extended to 11\/22. We had also\nobserved a 154-keV decay branch to a 441-keV state which\nin turn decayed via a 342-keV transition to the 5\/22 member\nof the 1\/22 rotational band. Our earlier tentative assignment\nof 7\/22 for the 441-keV level was confirmed in the present\nwork through the observation of two new decay branches of\n236 and 137 keV to the 7\/22 and 9\/22 members of the 1\/22\nrotational band. Another new 189-keV decay branch from\nthis level was observed to populate the known n@512#3\/22\nstate at an excitation energy of 252 keV. A previous tentative\nconfiguration assignment for the 441-keV 7\/22 state as a\nmember of the n@512#3\/22 band @9# seems tenuous, as no\ndecays are observed to any intermediate 5\/22 state. A tenta-\ntive configuration assignment of n@503#7\/22 for the 441-\nkeV level seems more reasonable and is consistent with en-\nergy systematics in neighboring nuclei.\nHigh-K configurations expected to lie especially low in\nthis nucleus are those associated with the n@624#9\/21 and\nthe n@615#11\/21 levels for neutrons and with the\np@514#9\/22 and the p@404#7\/21 states for the protons. The\nwell-known p2(82) combination, which is observed\nthroughout the even-even Hf isotopic chain, lies at an exci-TABLE I.

Our earlier placement of the n@624#9\/21\nstate at an excitation energy of 595 keV agreed with transfer\nreaction results of Burke et al. @10#, who had reported the\nobservation of a level at 60065 keV using a\n179Hf(t ,p)181Hf reaction. While no direct evidence for the\nn@615#11\/21 state had been found in our previous work @5#,\nBurke et al. had proposed a 11\/21 assignment to a level\nlying 2263 keV above the 9\/21 state. These authors argued\nthat, due to the Coriolis mixing with the 11\/21 rotational\nstate of the 9\/21 band, the intrinsic n@615#11\/21 level is\npushed down in energy. Their Coriolis-mixing calculations\nhad provided a consistent fit to five observed states, which\nincluded the 9\/21, 11\/21, and 13\/21 members of the\nn@624#9\/21 band and the 11\/21 and 13\/21 members of the\nn@615#11\/21 sequence. Their measured level energies lead\nto an energy difference of 14263 keV between the 13\/21\nand 11\/21 members of the n@615#11\/21 band and a differ-\nence of 20463 keV between the 11\/21 and 9\/21 members\nof the n@624#9\/21 band. The lowest band transition of 138\nkeV in our work is in good agreement with their 13\/21\n\u219211\/21 energy difference for the sequence based on the\n11\/21 bandhead. Multipolarity assignments of M1 to the\n138-, 170-, and 115-keV transitions and E2 to the 308- and\n285-keV g rays satisfy intensity balance requirements. The\nlarge electron conversion coefficient of 60 for a 22-keV M1\ntransition leaves very little intensity in the g branch for a\n11\/21 to 9\/21 transition. While the efficiency of the coaxial\ndetectors in our experimental setup was too small for the\ndetection of any g ray below \u201950 keV, the LEPS detectors\nwere ideally suited for this purpose. Although the statistics\naccumulated with just three LEPS detectors was relatively\npoor, a discernible peak at 22 keV was observed in the LEPS\nspectrum in coincidence with a 138-keV transition observed\nin the coaxial Ge detectors ~see Fig. 3!. The counts in the\npeak satisfy the intensity balance with a total conversion\ncoefficient a tot560620, which is in excellent agreement\nwith an M1 assignment @a tot(M1)560, a tot(E1)54.3,\na tot(M2)59700, a tot(E2)54200#. As discussed below, ad-\nditional experimental information and comparisons with the-\noretical expectations lead to the level scheme presented in\nFig. 1, with the new rotational band placed on a\nn@615#11\/21 bandhead at 617 keV, which decays via a\nK-allowed, 22-keV M1 transition to the n@624#9\/21 state at\n595 keV.\nWhile the systematics of the n@624#9\/21 state is well\ndocumented in the lighter odd-A Hf isotopes, data on the\nn@615#11\/21 level are lacking, since the orbital is only ex-\npected to approach the Fermi level for neutron-rich Hf iso-\ntopes. This 11\/21 level is observed, however, in the higher-Z\nisotones of W, Os, and Pt @9,11#. The systematic trend of\nexcitation energies for the n@624#9\/21 and n@615#11\/21 lev-\nels in the N5109 isotones is shown in Fig. 5, highlighting\ntheir close proximity in 181Hf. The M1 transition energies of\n138 keV and 170 keV ~with a 308-keV E2 crossover transi-\ntion! in the rotational band are consistent with the systemat-\nics of rotational bands built on 11\/21 bandheads in the re-\ngion @9,11#, considering the energy perturbations expected05430from the strong mixing between the n@624#9\/21 and\nn@615#11\/21 orbitals. It should be noted that the levels sug-\ngested by Burke et al. @10# that comprise the nonyrast exci-\ntations above the 9\/21 bandhead do not seem to be populated\nwith any observable strength from the decay of higher-lying\nisomers in our data.\nTypically, u(gK2gR)\/Q0u values extracted from the M1\/\nE2 g-branching ratios in high-K bands provide a solid ex-\nperimental observable for use in configuration assignments.\nUnfortunately, in the present case, Coriolis effects compli-\ncate the analysis in two ways. First, the strong Coriolis mix-\ning of the wave functions of the two configurations, arising\nfrom the closeness in their excitation energies, dilutes the\ndefinition of the K quantum number. Furthermore, the indi-\nvidual n@624#9\/21 and n@615#11\/21 orbitals are strongly in-\nfluenced by Coriolis alignment effects, and theoretical gK\nvalues have to be modified to include alignment contribu-\ntions in order to compare with experiment. Effective gK fac-\ntors, which include alignment contributions, can be calcu-\nlated for 1qp bands using the formula @12#\ngK\ne f f2gR5~gK2gR!S 12 i jAI22K2D , ~4.1!\nwhere i j is the aligned angular momentum. With an i j value\nof \u20191\\ and typical values for this region of gR50.28, Q0 of\n7.0 e b, and a quenching factor of 0.6 for the spin g factor,\nthe effective u(gK2gR)\/Q0u value, using K511\/2, is calcu-\nlated to be 0.056. Reasonable variations in the chosen param-\neters can change this number by \u201910%. Measurable inten-\nsities are available only from the bottom fragment of the\nband populated through the decay of higher-lying isomers.\nConsequently, only a single u(gK2gR)\/Q0u value could be\nextracted from the M1\/E2 intensity ratio of the 170-keV and\n308-keV g-ray branches depopulating the Jp515\/21 rota-\ntional state. The extracted values are 0.040~4! and 0.072~6!\nfor K values of 11\/2 and 9\/2, respectively. Coriolis mixing\nwould return a value in between these two extremes. An\nFIG. 5.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 64 054307estimate of the amount of mixing can be made along the\nlines of Burke et al. @10#. The unperturbed energies for the\nrotational states of the 9\/21 band are calculated using the\ntransition energies of the corresponding band observed in\n179Hf, where the n@615#11\/21 state is located at a much\nhigher excitation energy and no appreciable mixing can oc-\ncur. The analysis leads to a \u201950\/50 admixture of the K\n59\/2 and K511\/2 components in the observed 11\/21 band-\nhead, which translates to a u(gK2gR)\/Q0u value of 0.056~5!\nextracted from the M1\/E2 intensity ratio, consistent with the\neffective value calculated above. ~Using K59\/2 changes the\ncalculated effective value from 0.056 to 0.058.! Our new\ndata on 3qp isomers and their decays lend additional support\nfor a 11\/21 bandhead assignment.\nLow-lying 3qp excitations in the odd-A Hf nuclei are\ntypically seen to involve the p2(82) state coupled to\nquasineutron states. The lowest 3qp excitation expected in\n181Hf is a 17\/21 state, which corresponds to the p2(82)\nconfiguration coupled to the 1\/22 quasineutron ground state.\nA possible antialigned coupling of the neutron spin, leading\nto a 15\/21 state, is expected to lie \u2019200 keV higher due to\nresidual interactions. The 17\/21 state would very likely be a\nK isomer, since the levels expected immediately below cor-\nrespond to rotational excitations built on the 1qp K59\/2 or\nK511\/2 states. A Jp assignment of (17\/21) for the 1040-\nkeV isomer fits well with the observed decay pattern that\nfeeds the rotational band built on the 11\/21 bandhead. For\nthe 1738-keV isomer, the ms half-life and conversion coeffi-\ncients necessary for satisfying intensity balances leads to\nmultipolarity assignments of E3 for both the 499-keV and\n357-keV transitions (84% and 16% decay branches, respec-\ntively! and M1 for the 199-keV and 341-keV transitions.\nThis leads to a tentative Jp assignment of (25\/22) for the\n1738-keV isomer. Expected 3qp excitations above the 17\/21\nstate are the p2(82) configuration coupled to the neutron\n3\/22, 7\/22, 9\/21, and 11\/21 states, leading to 19\/21, 23\/21,\n25\/22, and 27\/22 levels, respectively. The partial half-life of\n963 ms for the 357-keV decay branch of the 1738-keV\nisomer to the (19\/21) state at 1381 keV is consistent with\na K-allowed E3 decay to an intrinsic K519\/2 state. The\nWeisskopf estimate for the half-life of such an E3 transition\nis 0.9 ms, while half-lives for other multipolarities differ by\nat least two orders of magnitude. The 142-keV transition\nconnecting the two states with tentative spin-parity assign-\nments of (19\/21) is very weak. The g-ray energy of 199 keV\nis consistent with that expected for the first M1 transition of\na rotational band built on a 17\/21 bandhead ~cf. energies of\n185 keV and 210 keV for analogous transitions in 179Hf\n@13#!. The 499-keV g ray would then be a K-hindered decay\nwith DK54 and a degree of forbiddenness, n5DK2l , of\n1, where l is the transition multipolarity. A possible M2\ndecay to a yet-to-be-located 21\/21 state of the 17\/21 rota-\ntional band, while energetically allowed, was not observed.\nThis scenario would be analogous, for example, to the DK\n54 decay of a 121 isomer in 180Hf to the rotational mem-\nbers of a K58 band, where the E3 g-decay path ~with n\n51) competes with the E1 branch ~with n53), and is a\nfactor of 30 stronger than the M2 path ~with n52). The05430absence of an E1 branch in our case could be explained if\nthe rotational 23\/21 state were located just above the\n(25\/22) isomer. The reduced hindrance f n5(texptg \/t1\/2W )1\/n\n~where texpt\ng is the partial g-ray half-life and t1\/2\nW is the cor-\nresponding Weisskopf single-particle estimate! for the E3\ndecay is 2267. This is consistent with an observed range of\n10\u2013150 for K-hindered E3 transitions in this region @5,9,13#.\nThe level scheme indicates that both the new 3qp isomers are\nyrast isomers.\nBlocked BCS calculations of the type described in Ref.\n@14# were performed for 181Hf, and effective residual inter-\nactions were calculated by summing the nucleon-nucleon in-\nteractions of all possible 2qp combinations @15,16#. The cal-\nculated energy levels with and without residual interactions\nare presented in Fig. 6. In these calculations, the single-\nparticle orbitals have been matched to 181Hf ~neutrons! and\n181Ta ~protons!. Monopole pairing strengths of 22.0 MeV\/\nnucleon ~neutrons! and 23.0 MeV\/nucleon ~protons! were\nused. The good agreement with calculations for the energies\nof the new 3qp isomers provides further support for our spin-\nparity assignments. In these calculations, residual interac-\ntions are seen to push the 27\/22 state just below the 25\/22\nlevel. This 27\/22 state is not observed in our out-of-beam\ndata, which suggests that the 27\/22 state probably lies above\nthe (25\/22) isomer and decays via a K-allowed transition to\nthe (25\/22) isomer. Close proximity between the two states\nis expected, given that the constituent one-quasineutron or-\nbitals, which couple with the same two-quasiproton configu-\nration to form these states, lie only 22 keV apart. Predictions\nfor the lowest-lying 5qp states are also presented in Fig. 6.\nResidual interactions seem to favor two possible 35\/22\n3n-2p states as the lowest 5qp levels at around 3.1 MeV.\nThe experimental evidence for long-lived feeding of the\n(25\/22) isomer suggests that such states at higher angular\nmomenta are possibly being populated.\nFIG. 6.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 64 054307V. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, the \u2018\u2018out-of-beam\u2019\u2019 experiments presented\nhere have been successful in identifying high-K configura-\ntions and long-lived isomers in the neutron-rich 181Hf\nnucleus. We have observed 3qp K isomers in neutron-rich\n181Hf, with tentative Jp assignments of (17\/21) and\n(25\/22), populated by one-neutron transfer from 238U\nbeams. Using Gammasphere, they were identified with\n\u2018\u2018early-delayed\u2019\u2019 coincidence techniques across isomers with\nhalf-lives as long as \u2019100 ms. The observation of a rota-\ntional band built on a n@615#11\/21 orbital in odd-A Hf nu-\nclei and its close proximity to the n@624#9\/21 orbital pro-\nvides a rich arena for extending into the neutron-rich region\nthe study of strong Coriolis mixing and alignment effects on05430high-K orbitals. Blocked BCS calculations with residual in-\nteractions are in good agreement with the observed 3qp\nstates. These results provide the foundation for experiments\nplanned in the near future to study the collective rotational\nstructures built on these multiquasiparticle excitations. These\ncomplementary data are essential for a comprehensive dis-\ncussion of the evolution of properties such as deformation\nand pairing strength with increasing neutron number beyond\nthe line of b stability.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of En-\nergy, Nuclear Physics Division, under Contracts Nos.
