A high-K t-band has been observed and its role in the first\ncrossing of the ground-state band established. The lack of isomerism of the identified I>18 multi-quasiparticle\nyrast states is presented as new evidence for triaxial shapes. @S0556-2813~99!50205-7#\nPACS number~s!: 21.10.Re, 23.20.Lv, 25.70.Jj, 27.70.1qShape is a fundamental property of atomic nuclei. The\nspherical ground-state equilibrium shapes of closed-shell\n\u2018\u2018magic\u2019\u2019 nuclei give way to deformed, usually prolate\nshapes in the midshell regions. Although a variety of shapes\nmay be found for excited nuclear states, the propensity for\naxial symmetry appears to be pervasive. Yet, there is a lack\nof suitable observables that are able to indicate departures\nfrom axial symmetry.\nOne of the most dramatic consequences of axial symme-\ntry is the existence of metastable intrinsic states, or isomers,\nwhich arise due to the conservation of the angular-\nmomentum projection K on the symmetry axis. Where an\nintrinsic state is yrast ~having the lowest excitation energy at\nthe given angular momentum! particularly long-lived isom-\nerism results, even at high angular momentum. A celebrated\ncase is the Kp5161, yrast four-quasiparticle state in 178Hf,\nwith a half-life of 31 years @1#. In contrast, the loss of K\nisomerism for an yrast intrinsic state could be an indicator of\nthe loss of axial symmetry. This possibility is explored in the\npresent work.\nWhere is one to look for such signals of triaxial nuclear\nshapes? Nilsson-model calculations, such as those of \u00c5berg\n@2# and Jain et al. @3#, show that some of the most favored\nsingle-particle orbitals for making high-K yrast states exist\nhigh in the N5822126 and Z550282 shells. Furthermore,\nas the N5126 and Z582 shell closures are approached, the\ndwindling number of valence nucleon holes leaves the cor-\nresponding nuclei increasingly susceptible to shape polariza-\ntion by broken-pair excitations. Signs of this are already evi-\ndent in, for example, the short-lived ~130 ns! decay of a\nKp5251, six-quasiparticle isomer in 76182Os106 @4,5#. How-\never, this isomer is far from yrast, and configuration mixing\ndue to the high density-of-states may play an important role\n@6# in the loss of K isomerism. Also, potential-energy-surface\ncalculations yield an equilibrium shape that is close to pro-\nlate @7# with an asymmetry parameter of g'10\u00b0. Since\nNilsson-model calculations @2,3# suggest that higher neutron\nnumbers could generate yrast multi-quasiparticle states in\nosmium isotopes, the present work focuses on 76\n186Os110 .

High-spin states in 76\n186Os were populated following\nfusion and the evaporation of four neutrons. The recoiling\nnuclei were stopped at the target position and the subsequent\ng-ray events were recorded using the Nordball array, com-\nprising 18 co-axial and 2 planar, Compton suppressed Ge\ndetectors and a 50 element BaF2 ball. The two planar detec-\ntors gave increased sensitivity to g rays with energies in the\n20 to 100 keV range, and the BaF2 ball was used as a high-\nefficiency g-ray multiplicity counter. A 30 element Si inner\nball was also present to enable the charged-particle evapora-\ntion channels to be studied. A master trigger required at least\n2 Ge and 3 BaF2 elements, or 2 Ge and 1 Si element to fire\nin coincidence. The time window for coincidences remained\nopen for 550 ns, started by the BaF2 or Si ball signal. This\nallowed half-lives to be measured in the ns to ms range. The\nGe detectors were arranged in rings at angles of 637\u00b0,\n679\u00b0, 6101\u00b0, and 6143\u00b0 to the beam direction. The partial\nlevel scheme shown in Fig. 1, was constructed using coinci-\ndence relations with previously known g rays from low-spin\nstates @8#. The spin assignments for the new levels have been\ndeduced using the method of directional correlations de-\nexciting oriented states ~DCO! @9#. Spin and parity informa-\ntion also comes from the observed g-ray intensity flow, by\nassuming that \u2018\u2018missing\u2019\u2019 intensity is due to competing elec-\ntron conversion.\nThe new data extend the previous knowledge @8,10# of the\n186Os level structure ~obtained with lighter-ion reactions! to\nhigher angular momenta. Of equal importance is the deter-\nmination of new non-yrast states both above and below the\nI'14 yrast band crossing, since the non-yrast states pro-\nfoundly affect the interpretation of the structure of the cross-\ning band. The level scheme concerning the yrast band was\nknown up to the Ip5181 level at 4496 keV @8,10# and the\n2-quasineutron states were established up to the Kp572,\nT1\/258.5 ns isomer at 1775 keV @8#. ~The K value is as-\nsumed to be equal to the spin of the bandhead.!

Partial decay scheme for the high-spin structure in 186Os deduced in the present work. The width of the arrows is proportional\nto the g-ray intensities ~black! and the electron conversion ~white!. Energies are in keV. The states shown in the bottom right correspond to\nthe bandheads of the vibrational and 2-quasiparticle states. Many additional states have been identified, including rotational bands built on\nthe Kp521, 52, 72, and 92 states. Half-lives ~or half-life limits! are given for several states.to the Kp572 bandhead. Intensity balancing shows that\neach of these transitions has M1 character, leading to a Kp\n592 assignment for the 6.1 ns isomer. Rotational bands\nbuilt on the Kp521, 52, 72, and 92 states have also been\nobserved @11# up to Ip5(121), (172), (222), and 172,\nrespectively. DCO analysis of interband transitions between\nexcited members of the Kp572 and 92 bands, arising due\nto a near energy degeneracy, provides additional confidence\nin the spin and parity assignments for these bands.\nThe spins and parities of the states in the band above the\n2564 keV level were established by the competing quadru-\npole decays to the ground-state ~g.s.! band and the 397 keV\ndipole transition from the bandhead to the Kp592 isomer.\nHence, the 2564 keV bandhead is assigned Kp5101. From\nthe excitation energy of the bandhead and the systematics of\nthe region, this Kp5101 state is assumed to have\n2-quasiparticle structure, but there are two possible configu-ration assignments, based on either two i13\/2 neutrons or two\nh11\/2 protons. To distinguish between these, the in-band\nE2-to-M1 intensity branching ratios can be used in conjunc-\ntion with the rotational model @12#, giving the factor u(gK\n2gR)\/Q0u50.03460.001, where gK and gR are the intrinsic\nand rotational g factors, respectively, and Q0 is the intrinsic\nquadrupole moment. This low value establishes the\n2-neutron configuration assignment ~the expected 2-proton\nvalue would be (gK2gR)\/Q0'0.16] which is supported by\nthe rotation-aligned component @13# of the angular momen-\ntum for the band (ix'8\\ at a rotational frequency of \\v\n50.23 MeV). The significant degree of rotational alignment\nin the Kp5101 band is an important part of the band-\ncrossing scenario discussed below. Although K mixing is an\ninevitable consequence of this Coriolis-induced rotational\nalignment, we continue to use \u2018\u2018Kp5101\u2019\u2019 as a convenient\nlabel.\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nR2336 PRC 59C. WHELDON et al.The Kp5101 band is yrast at I514 and 16, and is pre-\ndominantly fed from a previously known @8,10# yrast 181\nstate at 4496 keV. This is now seen to be distinct from the\nnew 181 member of the Kp5101 band at 4506 keV. The\nyrast 181 level also decays through other high-K structures\n~see Fig. 1! indicating an intrinsic configuration for this state.\nAt higher angular momentum, above the intrinsic 181 state,\nthe intensity fragments, possibly due to a large number of\nintrinsic states, but the levels are fed from a state at 7145\nkeV which de-excites by a 154 keV transition. DCO ratios,\ncombined with intensity matching requirements, determine\nthis transition to have E2 character. Detailed analysis leads\nto an Ip5281 assignment for the level at 7145 keV ~assum-\ning, in the absence of measurable half-lives, that the quadru-\npole transitions are electric rather than magnetic!.\nThe first band crossing in the yrast states at I514 is il-\nlustrated in Fig. 2. The crossing band is interpreted ~see\nabove! as being built on an (i13\/2)2, 2-quasineutron Kp\n5101 configuration. The occupation of these high-j orbitals\ncoupled to high K leads to rotation around an axis tilted @14#\nwith respect to the principal axes of the prolate spheroidal\nnuclear shape. The out-of-band decays proceed both via\nsmall changes in K, from the bandhead through the\n2-quasiparticle isomers, and via transitions that seem to\nchange K by large amounts, directly to the Kp501 g.s.\nband. The strongest of these apparently K-forbidden, out-of-\nband decays, is a 659 keV transition to the 121 member of\nthe g.s. band. ~Transitions of multipolarity l are called K\nforbidden if DK.l .! These anomalously strong transitions\ncan be explained by a two-band-mixing model with an inter-\naction strength of V547 keV. This can be considered to be\na Coriolis effect, which mixes low and high-K components\ninto the wave functions of the initial and final states, respec-\ntively, reducing the overall change in K, and hence the hin-\ndrance of the transition.\nBand crossings of this type, between two bands with sub-\nstantially different K values, have been observed in several\nother nuclei in the A'180 region @15\u201318#. In each case the\ncrossing band involves two i13\/2 neutrons coupled to high K.\nFIG. 2. A plot of level energy minus an arbitrary constant-rotor\nreference versus angular momentum. The even-spin members of the\ng.s. and Kp5101 bands are shown, together with higher-spin yrast\nand near-yrast states. The dashed line indicates the dominant inten-\nsity flow from the 281 yrast state.This is referred to as a \u2018\u2018t-band\u2019\u2019 @14#, in contrast to the usual\nlow-K , (i13\/2)2 s-band. The present data now provide the\nclearest example in an even-even nucleus of a t-band that\ncrosses a g.s. band. The weak interaction (V547 keV) re-\nsults in a sharp crossing ~see Fig. 2! that can be understood\nin a simple two-band-mixing model. The t-band crossing\nmarks a transition in the yrast structure with increasing an-\ngular momentum, from K'0 principal-axis rotation to high-\nK tilted rotation.\nAn important feature of the t-band in 186Os is the pro-\nnounced signature splitting in which the even-spin members\nbecome low in energy with respect to the odd-spin states.\nThis may be due to a combination of Coriolis mixing and\ndeformation effects. In particular, a large hexadecapole de-\nformation can bring the low-V , i13\/2 orbitals close to the N\n5110 Fermi surface @19# and non-axial deformations ~see\nbelow! could also play a role.\nAbove the first band crossing, the 181 intrinsic state lies\non the yrast line and feeds the t-band through an intense 560\nkeV E2 g-ray transition. The yrast 181 level at 4496 keV\nhas a half-life <0.5 ns, yet it appears to decay by a DK\n58 transition which is highly K forbidden. The observation\nthat the 181 member of the t-band lies only 10 keV higher,\nat 4506 keV, could be important to the interpretation of the\ndecay rate. A similar juxtaposition of states applies to the\nKp535\/22, 750 ns isomer in 179W @16#. In that case the\n35\/22 member of a K523\/2 band occurs only 22 keV below\nthe isomer. In Ref. @16#, the authors can explain the strong\nE2 decay to the K523\/2 band, and the 750 ns half-life, with\na mixing strength of 2463 eV between the two states. Such\na small mixing matrix element might not be uncommon be-\ntween intrinsic and rotational states, but it would not usually\nhave any observable consequences. If the same small mixing\ninteraction is used between the 181 states in 186Os, then the\nhindrance factor (FW , which is the ratio of the partial g-ray\nhalf-life to the Weisskopf single-particle estimate! for the\n560 keV transition is calculated to be 1.73103, which is at\nleast 500 times greater than the observed value of FW<3.\nHence, this direct mixing mechanism is unlikely to be the\nexplanation for the fast decay in 186Os. Another comparison\ncan be made with the K-forbidden 1530 keV decay from the\nKp5161, 6 ns isomer in 182Os @4#. In that case, the decay is\nalready extremely fast for a highly K-forbidden transition\n@6#, and proceeds with FW'33104, which is a factor of\n>104 more than for the 560 keV decay in 186Os. The differ-\nence is even greater than implied by this comparison be-\ncause, while the 182Os 161 isomer is far above the yrast line\nand may be considered @6# to suffer from substantial \u2018\u2018statis-\ntical\u2019\u2019 K mixing, the 186Os 181 state itself is yrast. Evi-\ndently, an additional effect is required to explain the excep-\ntionally fast decay from the 4496 keV, 181 intrinsic state.\nIt might be supposed that the 4496 keV, 181 state is in\nfact a rotational band member that decays out-of-band by\nsome chance mixing effects. However, the combination of its\nyrast status and the identification of all other 181 rotational\ncandidates, make such an interpretation highly unlikely. It is,\nhowever, simple to interpret the energy of the 181 yrast state\nas being due to an intrinsic Nilsson-model configuration.\nTo understand the intrinsic structures in 186Os, we have\nfirst performed axially symmetric calculations of the type\ndescribed by Jain et al. @3#. This \u2018\u2018blocked BCS\u2019\u2019 approach\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nPRC 59 R2337TRIAXIAL NUCLEAR SHAPES AT HIGH ANGULAR MOMENTUMuses Nilsson single-particle energies fitted ~where possible!\nto the neighboring odd-mass nuclei. Low-lying intrinsic\nstates with Kp5101, 181, and 281 are predicted. Table I\nshows the orbitals involved and both the experimental and\ncalculated energies. The favored configuration for the 181\nstate is a 4-quasiparticle (4n) excitation, and for the 281\nstate a 6-quasiparticle (4n2p) excitation. The calculation\nalso predicts a multitude of intrinsic states in the range 18\n<I<28, which could account for the fragmentary decay pat-\ntern observed. Although the energies of the intrinsic states\nmay be understood with these axially symmetric calcula-\ntions, a new approach is needed to explain the absence of K\nisomerism, and the possible role of triaxiality, particularly in\nthe decay of the 181 yrast state.\nTotal Routhian surface ~TRS! calculations, describing the\nshape evolution with increasing rotational frequency, have\nbeen presented by Balabanski et al. @10# for 186Os. These\nshow a transition from collective prolate rotation at low fre-\nquencies to non-collective behavior at high frequencies.\nSuch calculations provide a general understanding of the\nnuclear shape and indicate a substantial change in structure\nat I'18. However, this adiabatic approach does not describe\nspecific high-K configurations. To investigate which orbitals\nare responsible for the non-collective features, a new method\n@7# of diabatic blocking has been applied.\nConfiguration-constrained, potential-energy-surface cal-\nculations, with Lipkin-Nogami pairing and diabatic blocking,\nhave been performed for intrinsic states in 186Os. An impor-\ntant element of these calculations is the ability @7# to follow\nunambiguously the orbitals for large values of the triaxiality\nparameter g . Even though the Nilsson quantum numbers for\naxial symmetry are no longer conserved, we continue to use\nthese quantum numbers as convenient orbit labels. Figure 3\nshows the results for four such levels and the shape param-\neters at the minima are given in Table I. The g.s. and Kp\n5101 state have minima lying on the prolate, g50\u00b0 axis.\nThe softness to triaxial fluctuations is manifested both in the\nshape of the calculated potentials and, experimentally, as a\nlow-energy g vibration ~768 keV!. Similar calculated poten-\ntials have been found for all the low-lying 2-quasiparticle\nstates.\nThe calculated potential for the 181 intrinsic state ~Fig. 3,\nTABLE I.

This highly asymmetric\nshape means that K is strongly mixed, which may account\nfor the fast E2 transition to the t-band. Thus the short half-\nlife (,0.5 ns) of the 4496 keV, 181 intrinsic state, and the\nlack of K hindrance for its 560 keV, E2 decay, can be inter-\npreted to be a consequence of its triaxial shape. The calcu-\nlations show that the substantial shape change between the t-\nband and the 181 intrinsic state arises due to the occupation\nof the 9\/2@505# and 7\/2@503# neutron orbits, which drive the\nnucleus towards large g deformation. The calculation for the\nKp5281 configuration ~Fig. 3, bottom right! shows the\nasymmetry of the potential well deepening, with the mini-\nmum even closer to ugu530\u00b0. The triaxiality increases pri-\nmarily due to the occupation of the 11\/2@505# proton orbit.\nThese axially asymmetric shapes give rise to complete K\nnonconservation. Therefore, although multi-quasiparticle\nstates become yrast in 186Os for I>18, there is no corre-\nsponding K isomerism.\nIn summary, the high-spin structure of 186Os has been\nexplored using a fusion-evaporation reaction with a radioac-\ntive 14C beam. A Kp5101 t-band has been identified. Its\nrole in the yrast band crossing establishes a transition at I\n514 from principal-axis rotation to tilted-axis rotation. At\nhigher angular momenta (I>18), comparison with\nconfiguration-constrained potential-energy-surface calcula-\ntions suggest that the onset of triaxial shapes leads to fast\ndecays from yrast intrinsic states with complete loss of K\nhindrance.\nRamon Wyss is thanked for useful discussions.
