Magnetospheric physics (Magnetotail; Solar\nwind-magnetosphere interactions; Storms and substorms)\n1 Introduction\nThe magnetotail current sheet has been extensively stud-\nied since spacecraft technology allowed for in-situ measure-\nments to be made. These in-situ measurements have shown\nthat the current sheet often has a flapping or wavy motion\n(e.g. Sergeev et al., 2004, 2006) which is not only an interest-\ning dynamical feature, warranting its own investigation (e.g.\nZhang et al., 2002), but also facilitates the further investiga-\nCorrespondence to: C. Forsyth\n(cfo@mssl.ucl.ac.uk)\ntion of the current sheet structure (e.g. Sergeev et al., 2003;\nRunov et al., 2006).\nEarly studies of the current sheet motion were restricted\nto single spacecraft observations and as such, the motion\nof current sheet waves could not be determined unambigu-\nously. It was suggested that the current sheet motion may\nbe due to variations in the solar wind (Speiser and Ness,\n1967) or waves propagating across the tail (Nakagawa and\nNishida, 1989). Observations made by the multi-spacecraft\nCluster mission have removed this ambiguity. Case studies\n(Zhang et al., 2002; Runov et al., 2003; Sergeev et al., 2003;\nZhang et al., 2005) and statistical studies (Sergeev et al.,\n2006) have shown that during periods in which the Cluster\nspacecraft crossed the current sheet several times, the current\nsheet tended to be highly tilted in the YZ plane and exhibited\ntransient features in the dusk\/dawn direction away from the\ncentre of the tail. Zhang et al. (2005) also showed that cur-\nrent sheet waves extended over\u223c10RE in the Earthwards di-\nrection by comparing data from the Cluster and Double Star\nmissions. Using Cluster data to investigate the validity of the\nminimum variance analysis technique (MVA; Sonnerup and\nCahill, 1967; Sonnerup and Scheible, 1998), Sergeev et al.\n(2006) used Geotail data to show that the occurrence rate\nof plasma sheet flapping with radial and cross tail location\nwas comparable to the occurrence rate of bursty bulk flows\n(BBFs). They also showed that superposed epoch analysis of\nthe AE index at the time of plasma sheet flapping suggested\nthat plasma sheet flapping was likely during substorm ex-\npansion phases. This was in agreement with previous studies\n(e.g. Bauer et al., 1995; Sergeev et al., 1998) that suggested\nthat substorms might cause current sheet waves.\nPrior to substorm expansion phase onset, the magneto-\ntail becomes stretched and less dipolar (e.g. Fairfield and\nNess, 1970; Kokubun and McPherron, 1981; Nagai, 1982).\nFollowing the expansion phase onset, the tail magnetic\nfield topology becomes more dipolar, especially at geosyn-\nchronous orbit, coupled with the diversion of the cross tail\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2458 C.

This\ndipolarization of the field is initially localised and then ex-\npands azimuthally (Kokubun and McPherron, 1981; Nagai,\n1982). This dipolarization can extend over several RE down-\ntail (Nakamura et al., 2005) and the azimuthal propagation\nof the dipolarization at geosynchronous orbit has been asso-\nciated with the azimuthal expansion of the substorm auroral\nbulge (Liou et al., 2002). Furthermore, it has been shown that\nthe expansive motion of the auroral bulge is determined by\nthe polarity of the IMF BY component if the IMF BY is fairly\nsteady, although the speed of the expansion is only mod-\nerately correlated with the magnitude of the IMF BY (Liou\net al., 2006). Liou and Ruohoniemi (2006a,b) used two case\nstudies to show that the direction of the expansion of the au-\nroral bulge was dependent on the plasma convection flows at\nthe location of the auroral breakup.\nThis study investigates the tail and auroral dynamics fol-\nlowing a solar wind pressure pulse and two substorms. We\nexpand upon the study by Zhang et al. (2002), including data\nfrom Polar, GOES 8 and 10 and Cluster, enabling us to de-\ntermine a global picture of the magnetotail dynamics at this\ntime. Comparing magnetotail data and auroral observations,\nwe show that the azimuthal expansion of dipolarized regions\nextending radially across 12RE of the magnetotail is related\nto an auroral expansion. Using four-spacecraft timing anal-\nysis, we show that the expansion velocity of these regions\nis similar to the motion of the current sheet waves follow-\ning them. Furthermore, we test two models of current sheet\nwaves in order to determine which is more likely for this\nevent. From these observations and theoretical models, we\nspeculate that the velocities of both the waves and the dipo-\nlarization fronts are controlled by the configuration of the\nmagnetotail.\n2 Instrumentation\nIn this study, data are employed from the Cluster Flux-\nGate Magnetometers (FGM; Balogh et al., 2001), Cluster\nIon Spectrometer CODIF sensors (CIS-CODIF; Re`me et al.,\n2001), Cluster Plasma Electron and Current Experiment\nHEEA sensors (PEACE-HEEA; Johnstone et al., 1997), Po-\nlar Magnetic Field Experiment (MFE; Russell et al., 1995)\nand GOES 8 and 10 Magnetometers. We note that the\nGOES 8 data are subject to an offset in the BZ component\nand, hence, apply a correction of \u22127 nT (Tsyganenko et al.,\n2003). Prior to 08:08 UT, the FGM onboard Cluster was run-\nning in EXT mode. This mode stores spin resolution FGM\ndata in burst mode memory at times when the spacecraft are\nnot telemetering data. The data are telemetered to the ground\nat the first opportunity. These data are calibrated using the\nonboard calibrations and have an increased uncertainty in the\ntime-stamps due to the collection method (see Balogh et al.,\n2001, for details). After 08:08 UT, FGM data based on the\n5 Hz resolution data from the Cluster Active Archive (CAA)\nare employed. These data have been calibrated to facilitate\nthe multi-spacecraft analysis techniques used in this study.\nPolar MFE data have a temporal resolution of 6 s, whereas\nGOES MAG data have a temporal resolution of 60 s. The\nmoments from the PEACE-HEEA sensors have been calcu-\nlated on the ground from a reduced angular resolution 3-\nD particle distribution (3DX \u2013 see Johnstone et al., 1997).\nGround moments use improved calibrations and improved\ncorrections for the effects of the spacecraft potential. The\n3-D distributions are not telemetered on every spin, so the\nmoments have a lower cadence which varies between space-\ncraft. Spacecraft data are presented in GSM coordinates un-\nless otherwise stated.\nFigure 1 shows the location of the Cluster and Polar space-\ncraft and Fig. 2 shows that of Polar, GOES 8 and GOES 10\nin GSM coordinates between 06:00 and 12:00 UT.

During the interval ACE\nwas situated at approximately [245,\u221215,30]RE , sunward of\nthe Earth. Solar wind data from ACE are lagged by compar-\ning the IMF with magnetometer data from the IMAGE mag-\nnetometer array (Luhr, 1994; Viljanen and Ha\u00a8kkinen, 1997),\nwhich was on the dayside between 07:00 and 13:00 MLT,\nfollowing the technique demonstrated by Volwerk et al.\n(2004).\nNorthern Hemisphere auroral data are also employed\nfrom the Far UltraViolet imager Wideband Imaging Camera\n(FUV-WIC; Mende et al., 2000a,b,c) on board the IMAGE\nspacecraft.

The ram pressure then slowly decreased,\nreaching 6 nPa by the end of the interval, with increases of\n\u223c2 nPa at 08:55 and 10:20 UT. Prior to the initial pressure\npulse, the ram pressure was 2 nPa and the IMF was consis-\ntently southward. Data from 00:00 UT (not shown) indicates\nthat the IMF was southward for almost 5 h prior to the in-\nterval shown in Fig. 4. Just before the pressure pulse, the\nIMF BZ dropped to 0 nT.

The dashed lines indicate the times of the dipolariza-\ntions of the field.\nalthough, compared to the model, the magnetic field was\nslightly stretched, indicated by the slightly depressed BZ\ncomponents (Fig. 7c), particularly at GOES 10. Data from\nthe Polar spacecraft shows that it also detected a stretched\nfield at this time in the post-midnight sector (Fig. 7c). At\n07:15 UT, BX and BY increased in magnitude at GOES 8 fol-\nlowed shortly by a larger increase in BX and BY at GOES 10.\nSince these increases are not associated with dipolarizations\nof the field, this indicates that the spacecraft detected an in-\ncrease in the Region 1 currents caused by the pressure pulse.\nPolar detected a circularly polarized wave at this time (la-\nbelled P1) with a period of \u223c150 s. GOES 10 detected two\ndipolarizations of the magnetic field at 07:35 and 08:25 UT\nand GOES 8 detected two dipolarizations at 07:47 UT and\n08:45 UT, indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 7. A final\ndipolarization of the magnetic field at GOES 8 at 09:10 UT\nbrought the magnetic field level back towards the model field\nlevel, suggesting that the spacecraft moved out of the dis-\nturbed tail region and round onto the flanks of the magneto-\nsphere. Polar detected two dipolarizations of the magnetic\nfield at 08:08 and 08:40 UT respectively, labelled (D1 and\nD3). The first of these dipolarizations was very rapid, with\nthe BZ component of the magnetic field increasing by 20 nT\nin 45 s. This was in contrast to the dipolarizations at the\nGOES spacecraft, which occurred over approximately 5 min.\nThe second dipolarization was associated with a large in-\ncrease in BX and BY , with similar but more extended in-\ncreases observed by GOES 8. This indicates that GOES 8\nand Polar detected the Earthward directed current that makes\nup part of the substorm current wedge. It is interesting to\nnote that GOES 10 did not see a signature of the return cur-\nrent, although this is likely due to the location of the space-\ncraft at that time. The dipolarization at GOES 10 at 10:15 UT\nwas due to the substorm expansion phase observed in the AL\nindices and auroral keogram (Fig. 6).\nFigure 8 is a stack plot of magnetic field data from Cluster\nin the same format as Fig. 7.

The\ndashed lines show the times of the dipolarizations and the\ndotted lines indicate the current sheet waves.\nFrom 06:45 UT, BZ at Cluster dropped steadily reaching\nhalf the model value by 07:15 UT, indicating that the magne-\ntotail was stretching. At 07:18 UT, BX and the magnetic field\nmagnitude rapidly doubled (labelled P2), accompanied by a\ndrop in the latitude angle, indicating that Cluster detected the\ncompression of the magnetotail by the solar wind pressure\npulse. Following the pressure pulse, there were two large\ndipolarizations of the field starting at 07:50 and 08:37 UT\nobserved as a more than doubling of BZ (Fig. 8c) and in-\ndicated by the vertical dashed lines in the plot. The first of\nthese is associated with a drop in the BX component, indi-\ncating that it occurred when Cluster first detected a current\nsheet wave and is discussed in the next section. The second\nof these (labelled D2), for which ion moments were avail-\nable, was accompanied by a slight increase in the ion tem-\nperature to 95 MK at Cluster 1 and 4. In concert with this,\nthere was a much smaller enhancement in the electron tem-\nperature at Cluster 2. Data from Cluster 1, 3 and 4 were\nof insufficient temporal resolution to determine whether or\nnot there was an increase in the electron temperature at these\nspacecraft.

In particular, the high speed ions\nshowed a large velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field\nin the Earthwards direction, indicating that Cluster detected a\nbursty bulk flow (BBF; Angelopoulos et al., 1992) and which\nwas likely associated with the auroral substorm activity seen\nat this time (Fig. 6).\nFigure 10 shows the average auroral luminosity between\n55\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 magnetic latitude in bins of 1 h of MLT from\nthe FUV-WIC onboard the IMAGE spacecraft. The MLT\nmarked indicates the eastern edge of the bin, such that the\nFig. 10.

The largest\nincrease occurred between 23:00 and 02:00 MLT, where the\naverage luminosity increased by 750\u20131000 R. Outside this\nrange the increase was\u223c500 R. At 07:40 UT there was an in-\ncrease of over 1000 R in the 22:00 MLT sector accompanied\nby a 500 R increase in the 23:00 MLT sector. This propa-\ngated eastward, with the peak of the brightening reaching the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2457\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 2457\u20132474, 2009\n2464 C.

A further, smaller enhancement\nappeared at 08:18 UT in the 22:00 MLT sector and again\npropagated eastward, with the peak of the brightening reach-\ning the 03:00 MLT sector by 09:12 UT before decaying to a\nminimum at 10:00 UT. A final enhancement, initiated in the\n23:00 MLT sector at 10:12 UT, propagated both eastward and\nwestward.\nThe red lines in Fig. 10 show that the dipolarizations de-\ntected by the Cluster and GOES spacecraft occurred just\nprior to the auroral enhancements, apart from the second\ndipolarization detected by GOES 10, indicating that the dipo-\nlarizations of the tail magnetic field were associated with the\nauroral substorms. The first dipolarization detected by Polar\noccurred at the time of peak brightness in the 03:00 MLT sec-\ntor. Given this, and the much quicker dipolarization observed\nby Polar at this time, it seems unlikely that the dipolarization\ndetected by Polar was the same feature detected by GOES.\nFigure 10 shows that the enhancement of the aurora was\nless rapid as the aurora progressed towards dawn, hence de-\ntermining the speed from the peaks of the auroral enhance-\nments, which are well defined, would give a slower aurora\nexpansion velocity than than if the velocity were determined\nfrom the start times of the enhancements. As such, we de-\ntermine the velocity of the auroral expansion based on the\nstart of the auroral enhancement in each sector. The eastward\nexpansion velocities of the aurora were 5.5 and 2.75 kms\u22121\nfor the first and second expansions respectively. Assuming\nthat the dipolarization region expands in the Y direction be-\ntween GOES 10 and GOES 8 gives the dipolarization expan-\nsion velocities as 69 and 32 kms\u22121 respectively. Mapping\nthese velocities into the ionosphere from GOES 8 using the\nT89 model gives corresponding ionospheric velocities of 7\nand 3 kms\u22121, hence the auroral expansion velocities and the\ndipolarization region expansion velocities were similar.\nFour-spacecraft timing analysis (Harvey, 1998) compares\nthe lag of a given feature in the magnetic field across four\npoints in space, and determines the velocity of the feature.\nFor a planar discontinuity, the direction of travel is equiva-\nlent to the direction normal to the discontinuity. Assuming\nthat the magnetic field variations are locally planar, in par-\nticular on the scale size of the Cluster tetrahedron, we apply\nthese techniques to determine the propagation direction of\nthe compression front and dipolarizations in the tail.\nTable 1 shows the results of four-spacecraft timing anal-\nysis of the magnetic field data from Cluster for the effects\nof the pressure pulse (P2 above) and for the dipolarization\nthat is not directly associated with a current sheet wave (D2\nabove). The results from the four-spacecraft timing analysis\nare from a 10 min window centred on the time given. This\nwindow aids the comparison of the field between multiple\nspacecraft and visually checking the results. The data were\nsmoothed using a 40 s Boxcar filter in order to remove any\nsmall scale fluctuations in the magnetic field. The lags be-\ntween the spacecraft were determined from local minima and\nmaxima in the BX component for the pressure pulse event\nand theBZ component for the dipolarizations. Results shown\nin italics were determined using EXT mode data from Clus-\nter.\nThe results from the four-spacecraft timing analysis indi-\ncate that the normal to the compression front at Cluster (P2)\nwas orientated predominantly in the Z direction, whereas the\ndipolarization front was travelling in the \u2212Y direction and\nEarthward. Projecting the velocity of the dipolarization front\ninto the ionosphere using the T89 model gives corresponding\neastward ionospheric velocity of 2.5 kms\u22121. This velocity\nis a good match for the observed auroral expansion velocity\nat this time and the projected ionospheric velocity from the\nGOES spacecraft.\nIn summary, data from the magnetometers onboard Clus-\nter, Polar and GOES 8 and 10 have shown that prior to the so-\nlar wind pressure pulse the magnetotail was stretched due to\nthe extended period of southward IMF. Following the arrival\nof the pressure pulse, the magnetosphere was compressed\noutside 6RE and the Region 1 currents were enhanced. The\neffects of the pressure pulse travelled downtail from GOES to\nCluster, as we would expect for a travelling solar wind pres-\nsure front. Following the pressure pulse, dipolarizations were\nobserved at GOES 10, GOES 8, and Polar at 07:35, 07:47,\nand 08:08 UT, respectively, and by GOES 8, GOES 10, Clus-\nter and Polar at 08:25, 08:45, 08:37 and 08:40 UT, respec-\ntively. The dawnwards propagation of these dipolarizations\nbetween the GOES spacecraft and at Cluster was consistent\nwith observations of dawnward moving aurora in the IMAGE\nFUV data, indicating that the dipolarizations were due to the\noccurrence of substorms and that at least one of the dipolar-\nizations was observed across a distance of 12RE downtail.\n3.3 Current sheet wave observations\nFollowing the solar wind pressure pulse, Cluster observed\nmultiple, pseudo-periodic reductions and recoveries in the\nBX component of the magnetic field, accompanied by local\npeaks in the field latitude angle starting at 07:30 UT (Fig. 8).\nAfter 08:48 UT, Cluster crossed the current sheet several\ntimes. These current sheet crossings have previously been\nstudied by Zhang et al. (2002), who determined that they\nwere due to current sheet waves. Given that BX reduces on\napproach to the current sheet, it is apparent the periodic re-\nductions in BX prior to the current sheet crossings were also\ndue to a wavy current sheet. Following the second substorm,\nPolar observed periodic decreases in the BX component of\nthe magnetic field away from the elevated level with a similar\nform to those at Cluster. These are interpreted as the current\nsheet moving towards Polar, similar to the Cluster observa-\ntions prior to the second substorm. These wave encounters at\nCluster and Polar are labelled W1\u201313 in chronological order\non Figs. 7 and 8.\nFigure 9 shows that, following the second substorm,\nthe current sheet wave had little effect on the plasma\nAnn.

The electron tempera-\nture increased by 5 MK at the first wave encounter following\nthe dipolarization D2 and remained at this elevated level un-\ntil after the last current sheet crossing. Small variations in\nthe ion VZ component were present, due to the bulk vertical\nmotion of the current sheet and its plasma. These will be\ndiscussed further in Sect. 4.\nMinimum variance analysis (MVA; Sonnerup and Cahill,\n1967; Sonnerup and Scheible, 1998) can be used to deter-\nmine the direction normal to a planar discontinuity or spatial\nvariation in the magnetic field based on the assumption that\nmagnetic field component normal to the discontinuity does\nnot vary and that there is significant variation in the field in\nthe plane of the discontinuity. In the ideal case, minimum\nvariance analysis requires that at the magnetic field disconti-\nnuity, the two components of the magnetic field in the plane\nof the discontinuity vary to give a rotation of the field across\nthe discontinuity and the magnetic field perpendicular to the\ndiscontinuity is invariant. In reality, small scale spatial and\ntemporal variations mean that there is an apparent field vari-\nation perpendicular to the discontinuity, hence the ratio of\nthe variances in the minimum and intermediate directions is\nused to indicate how well defined the minimum variance di-\nrection is. The MVA technique provides a variance matrix\nand associated eigenvalues, \u03bb1, \u03bb2 and \u03bb3, corresponding to\nthe directions of maximum, intermediate and minimum vari-\nance respectively.\nSergeev et al. (2006) used data from the Cluster space-\ncraft to compare the results of MVA and four-spacecraft tim-\ning for 109 current sheet crossings. They found that when\n\u03bb2\/\u03bb3 > 4 the vectors from the two techniques mostly agreed\nto within 30\u00b0 . This indicates that, unlike the Harris cur-\nrent sheet model (Harris, 1962) which only has a direction of\nmaximum variance, the tail current sheet has an intermediate\nvariance direction which lies approximately in the direction\nof the cross-tail current and, as such, a minimum variance di-\nrection normal to the current sheet. Sergeev et al. related this\nvariation in the intermediate direction to field-aligned cur-\nrents or perturbations. Other effects, such as tail BY com-\nponents due to reconnection with the solar wind might also\ncause sufficient departure from the Harris model to introduce\nan intermediate variance direction. Since Polar is a single\nspacecraft, the MVA technique is used on data from Polar\nand Cluster to aid cross-comparison between them. Based\non Sergeev et al. (2006), we will take \u03bb2\/\u03bb3 > 4 to indicate\nthat the MVA results are reliable.\nTables 2 and 3 list 13 current sheet oscillations from the\nCluster and Polar datasets. Table 2 lists the results from MVA\nand four-spacecraft timing analysis from Cluster along with\nthe angular difference between the vectors from the two tech-\nniques. Table 3 lists the MVA results from Polar along with\nthe angular difference between the Polar MVA vectors and\nthe Cluster MVA vectors and between the Polar MVA vec-\ntors and the Cluster four-spacecraft timing vectors.\nThe angles between the MVA and four-spacecraft timing\nvectors from the Cluster data indicate that the two techniques\ngive similar results for the direction of the current sheet wave,\nwith the vectors being within \u223c10\u00b0 \u221220\u00b0 of each other. The\nangular difference between the two techniques and the \u03bb2\/\u03bb3\nratios are in keeping with Sergeev et al. (2006). Compar-\ning the MVA results from Polar with the MVA and four-\nspacecraft timing analysis results from Cluster shows that\nthese vectors were not so well aligned, with the angle be-\ntween the vectors varying between 45\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 , despite the\nreasonably good \u03bb2\/\u03bb3. However, upon closer inspection, it\nis obvious that all the vectors after 07:57 UT were directed\ndawnwards and Earthwards at both Cluster and Polar, apart\nfrom the MVA vector from W9 (Cluster) which has a tailward\ncomponent. The largest variations between the Cluster and\nPolar vectors appears to be in the Z component; the Z com-\nponents from the four-spacecraft timing analysis at Cluster\nall had a magnitude less than 0.33 and were predominantly\nnegative, whereas the components from the MVA at Polar\nwere generally larger than this but positive. Also, the X com-\nponent of the Polar MVA vectors was a factor of two or more\nlarger.\nComparing the auroral activity (Fig. 10) to the observa-\ntions of the current sheet waves, we note that the auroral lu-\nminosity in the 02:00 MLT sector reached a minimum shortly\nafter the last current sheet crossing by Cluster. As such, the\nlifetime of the auroral luminosity and the wave activity at\nCluster were similar.\nTo summarise; Cluster and Polar observed large, rapid\nchanges in the magnetic field BX component following the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2457\/2009\/ Ann.

However, the Z com-\nponent of the normal to the current sheet had opposite senses\nat Cluster and Polar, such that the angle between the current\nsheet orientation at Cluster and Polar was large.\n4 Comparison of current sheet wave models\nVarious models have been proposed to explain how the\nplasma sheet supports waves propagating perpendicular to\nthe magnetic field. Early models based on MHD were un-\nable to explain the relatively low speed of the cross-tail\nwaves (\u223c100 kms\u22121) compared with the local sound speed\n(\u223c1000 kms\u22121) whereas models based on ion drift fail to ex-\nplain wave motion in the dawnward direction (Sergeev et al.,\n2004, and references therein). Golovchanskaya and Maltsev\n(2005) proposed a model based on the application of the bal-\nlooning instability waves (Safargaleev and Mal\u2019Tsev, 1986)\nin a curved magnetic field. From the dispersion relation for\nballooning perturbations,\n\u03c92 =V 2Ak2\u2016+\u03c9g\nk2y\nk2n+k2y\n(1)\nand using the assumptions made by Golovchanskaya and\nMaltsev, it can be shown that the phase velocity of the wave\nin the Y direction is\nv\np\ny \u2248VA\n\u221a\n2BZ+B lobeX\nBZaky\n(2)\nwhere VA is the Alfve\u00b4n velocity of the current sheet particles,\nBZ is the Z component of the magnetic field through the\nplasma sheet, B lobeX is the X component of the magnetic field\nin the lobe, a is the current sheet half-thickness and k is the\nwave vector in the (\u2016) field-aligned, (n) field-normal and (Y )\nazimuthal directions.\nErkaev et al.

The two tech-\nniques give similar results for all the crossings, apart from\nthe crossing at 09:14 UT. For this crossing, the correlation\ncoefficient between VZ and dBZ\/dt from Cluster 1 was low,\nindicating that the gradient between them, and hence the cur-\nrent sheet thickness, was not well defined.\nDuring the first current sheet crossing, the current sheet\nwas very thin (half-thickness less than 0.5RE). Subse-\nquently, the current sheet thickened, reaching a maximum\nhalf-thickness of between 1 and 1.8RE , before thinning\nagain prior to the substorm at 10:15 UT.\nData from the PEACE and CIS-CODIF sensors (Fig. 9)\nshow that the particle density during this interval was\n\u223c0.4 cm\u22123. Using an ion population of 95% H+ and 5%\nO+, as detected by the CIS-CODIF sensor, a lobe magnetic\nfield in the X direction of 40 nT, a sheet magnetic field of\n25 nT with a BZ of 15 nT, a current sheet Alfve\u00b4n velocity\nof 650 kms\u22121, a wave length of 4RE (from Zhang et al.,\n2002), and the average current sheet half-thicknesses from\nthe above techniques (excluding the third value from Clus-\nter 1, which is clearly in error as discussed above), the phase\nvelocity from the Golovchanskaya and Maltsev model were\ncalculated to be between 1000 and 5000 kms\u22121, which is two\norder of magnitudes larger than observed.\nUsing the mean magnetic field gradients determined by\nCluster during 200 s surrounding each of the current sheet\ncrossings and the same ion density as above, the wave pe-\nriods in the Erkaev et al. model are determined to be be-\ntween 2 to 8.5 min. Using the average magnetic field gradi-\nents during the interval gives a wave period of 6 min. These\nperiods are somewhat smaller than the observed period of\napproximately 20 min. Using the calculated wave frequen-\ncies, the wave speeds from the Erkaev et al. model were 44\nto 130 kms\u22121, although using a 20 min period gives veloc-\nities from 13 to 20 kms\u22121, approximately two-thirds of the\nobserved velocities.\nFigure 14 shows the temporal variation of the velocity of\nthe waves in the YGSM direction, determined from the four-\nspacecraft timing analysis of the Cluster data, along with the\nphase velocities calculated from the Erkaev et al. model for a\nFig. 14.

The observed and model\nvelocities follow similar trends, although the model veloc-\nities are approximately two-thirds of the observed veloci-\nties, as noted above. It should be noted that the true phase\nvelocity of these waves should be across the current sheet,\nwhereas the observed velocity is the velocity perpendicular\nto the wave front. Given that the current sheet was in motion\nat this time, it is difficult to determine its average inclination\nin the YZ plane. As such, the velocity of the waves in the Y\ndirection is taken as an approximation to the phase velocity\nof the waves.\n5 Discussion\n5.1 Magnetospheric compression and magnetotail dipo-\nlarizations\nIn this study, a solar wind pressure pulse, following an ex-\ntended period of southward IMF, was observed to compress\nthe magnetosphere prior to the onset of three substorms. Sub-\nsequent to the arrival of the solar wind pressure pulse at the\ndayside, the magnetic field magnitude at Cluster\u2019s location in\nthe tail increased by a factor of\u223c2, dominated by an increase\nin the BX component (Fig. 8a and d). Data from GOES 8 and\n10 also showed increases in the magnetic field magnitude at\nthis time (Fig. 7) associated with an enhancement in the Re-\ngion 1 currents. Polar observed a circularly polarised wave\ninside of 5RE XGSM at this time, with a period of \u223c2.5 min.\nThe solar wind pressure pulse excited global auroral activ-\nity. Data from FUV-WIC on board the IMAGE spacecraft\nshowed that, following the solar wind pressure pulse, the av-\nerage luminosity in the nightside MLT sectors increased by\nup to 1000 R, with the largest increase occurring from 23:00\nto 03:00 MLT.\nFollowing the pressure pulse, three substorm expansion\nphases, starting at 07:35, 08:18 and 10:15 UT respectively,\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2457\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 2457\u20132474, 2009\n2470 C. Forsyth et al.: Excitation of the wavy current sheet\nwere observed in auroral and ground magnetometer data\n(Fig. 6). In the magnetosphere, GOES 8 and 10, Polar and\nCluster all observed dipolarizations of the magnetic field. At\nCluster, the first dipolarization was observed in tandem with\na current sheet wave. At Polar, the first dipolarization was\nmuch more rapid that at the other spacecraft. During the final\nsubstorm, Cluster detected a bursty bulk flow (Angelopoulos\net al., 1992) and crossed the magnetotail current sheet twice.\nThe eastward expansion velocities of the first two auroral\nsubstorms were well matched by the projected ionospheric\nvelocities of the dipolarizations from GOES. Mapping the\npropagation of the dipolarization across the Cluster space-\ncraft into the ionosphere also gave an ionospheric velocity of\nthe footpoint of the dipolarization comparable to the auroral\nexpansion velocity. This indicates that the region of dipo-\nlarized magnetic field associated with the second substorm\nextended over 12RE and expanded eastwards. These obser-\nvations are consistent with Liou et al. (2002) and Nakamura\net al. (2005) who showed the correlation between the motion\nof an auroral substorm and dipolarizations at geostationary\norbit and the detection of a dipolarization front across 5RE\nrespectively. The eastward motion of the aurora is also con-\nsistent with the IMF BY control of the motion of the auroral\nbulge (Liou et al., 2006; Liou and Ruohoniemi, 2006a,b).\n5.2 Current sheet wave\nFollowing the solar wind pressure pulse, Cluster and Polar\nobserved large, rapid decreases and recoveries in the mag-\nnetic field magnitude, dominated by variations in the BX\ncomponent and accompanied by increases in the latitude an-\ngle. The variations in the field at Polar were not observed\nuntil after the second substorm. In a previous study of this\ntime, Zhang et al. (2002) showed that, after 08:48 UT, the\nvariations in the magnetic field at Cluster were due to Clus-\nter crossing the current sheet several times. They related\nthese current sheet crossings to a current sheet wave and used\nfour-spacecraft timing analysis on the BX=0 nT crossings to\ndetermine that the wave was travelling in the \u2212Y direction.\nWe have expanded upon this study, incorporating data from\na larger dataset and including data from the Polar spacecraft.\nAlthough prior to 08:48 UT Cluster did not cross the current\nsheet, the periodic reductions in the BX component indicate\nthat the current sheet wave was present at this time. During\nthe third substorm, Cluster crossed the current sheet twice\nduring the passage of a bursty bulk flow. It is clear from the\nparticle moments and the magnetic field data that the plasma\ndynamics during these crossings were very different from the\ncurrent sheet wave activity beforehand. As such, these cross-\nings are not considered within this study.\nOnly three out of the nine Cluster observations of the cur-\nrent sheet wave had values of \u03bb2\/\u03bb3 < 4. In keeping with\nSergeev et al. (2006), the angles between the vectors from\nthe MVA and four-spacecraft timing analysis were fairly low.\nHowever, comparing the angle between the MVA vectors at\nPolar and the MVA and four-spacecraft timing analysis vec-\ntors at Cluster shows that the vectors are consistently out by\n> 40\u00b0 despite one of the events having a particularly high\n\u03bb2\/\u03bb3. This would suggest that there was some offset be-\ntween the Polar and Cluster vectors, most likely due to their\nlarge separation. Comparing the vectors directly shows that\nthe Y components are fairly consistent but the angle in the\nXZ plane is oppositely directed at one spacecraft compared\nwith the other. The results of the MVA and four-spacecraft\ntiming analysis at Cluster (Table 2) and MVA at Polar (Ta-\nble 3) has shown that for all the waves observed following\nthe substorms, the waves were travelling in the \u2212Y direc-\ntion, although it is not possible to determine whether or not\nthe waves at Polar were travelling in this direction or the\nopposite direction unambiguously. However, given that the\ndipolarization fronts and auroral enhancements were travel-\nling dawnwards, it seems reasonable to suggest that the same\nis true for the current sheet wave in the vicinity of Polar.\nDespite FGM EXT mode being designed to provide con-\ntextual information and not usually suited to multi-spacecraft\nanalysis (Brown et al., 2008), comparison between the MVA\nand four-spacecraft timing analysis of the data and compari-\nson of the results of these techniques between the EXT mode\ndata and 5 Hz CAA data would suggest that the results, in\nthis case, are reliable, given the similarity between the vec-\ntors obtained at different times and the relatively small angle\nbetween the vectors from the two different techniques.\nPrior to the first substorm, Cluster observed periodic vari-\nations in the magnetic field with phase fronts orientated pre-\ndominantly in the Z direction. The orientation of these vari-\nations was more in keeping with the orientation of the com-\npression front observed at 07:19 UT. It is unclear whether\nthis oscillation of the magnetosphere prior to the first sub-\nstorm is the generation mechanism for the current sheet wave\nand that the substorms acted to modify the wave\u2019s propaga-\ntion, or whether the substorms introduced a new wave into\nthe system.\nThat the spacecraft did not cross the current sheet follow-\ning the first substorm may be due to several factors. Using\nthe change in BX as a proxy for the amplitude of the os-\ncillation, it appears that the amplitude increased following\neach substorm. As such, the amplitude of the oscillation may\nhave only become sufficient following the second substorm\nto cause the spacecraft to cross the current sheet. Alterna-\ntively, as Cluster was moving towards the current sheet from\nthe northern part of the magnetotail, Cluster would have ap-\nproached closer to the average position of the centre of the\ncurrent sheet between the two substorms, such that Cluster\nwas close enough to cross the current sheet following the\nsecond substorm. Petrukovich et al. (2006) noted that the\nwave amplitude increased with increasing tilt of the current\nsheet for a fortuitous event on 3 August 2004. This does not\nappear to be the case for the oscillations studied here.\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 2457\u20132474, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2457\/2009\/\nC. Forsyth et al.: Excitation of the wavy current sheet 2471\n5.3 Comparison of current sheet wave models\nThe observations of the current sheet waves were used to\ncompare the current sheet wave models of Golovchanskaya\nand Maltsev (2005) and Erkaev et al. (2008). As both mod-\nels use the current sheet thickness in their calculation of fur-\nther parameters, it was necessary to determine the current\nsheet thickness. This was determined in two ways; by cor-\nrelating VZ with dBX\/dt and BY and BX (Sergeev et al.,\n1998) and by determining the temporal and spatial variations\nof the field Runov et al. (2005). Although the correlation co-\nefficient between VZ and dBX\/dt was less than 0.3 for two\nof the current sheet crossings, and DivB\/CurlB was signifi-\ncantly higher for the same event (indicating a poorer deter-\nmination of j and \u2207B), Fig. 13 shows that the two methods\ngave similar results for the current sheet thicknesses during\neach of the crossings. It also appears that the current sheet\nwas thickening between 08:49 and 09:17 UT before thinning\nslightly.\nUsing the model of Golovchanskaya and Maltsev (2005),\nthe calculated velocities were found to be two orders of mag-\nnitude larger than the observed velocities. In contrast, the\nwave velocities from the model of Erkaev et al. (2008) were\nclose to those observed and that followed the same trend\n(Fig. 14). As such, the Erkaev et al. model appears to be\nmore applicable in this situation. It is worth noting, however,\nthat using the Erkaev et al. model to calculate the expected\nwave frequencies using the observed magnetic field gradients\nreturned values that an order of magnitude smaller than ob-\nserved. This may represent an over simplification of the tail\nmagnetic field topology used by Erkaev et al. (2008) or may\nindicate that the observed magnetic field gradients are not in-\ndicative of the global properties of the magnetosphere. The\nmost likely explanation is that it is some combination of both\neffects.\nBoth Golovchanskaya and Maltsev (2005) and Erkaev\net al. (2008) used their models to determine the group ve-\nlocity of the waves and compared this to the observed veloc-\nities reported in previous studies (e.g. Sergeev et al., 2004).\nAlthough the group velocity may give us more information\nabout the energy transported in the waves, by the nature of\nthe observations, the observed velocity must be the phase ve-\nlocity of the waves. It is clear from the dispersion relations\nthat the phase and group velocities are not equal in these\nmodels. As such, we compared the phase velocities from\nthese models with the observations.\nNeither of the models discussed consider the generation\nmechanism for the flapping motion of the plasma sheet, only\nthe mechanism that supports the wave propagation. Erkaev\net al. (2008) suggested that BBFs created by reconnection\nevents may excite the wave activity \u201clike a ship moving on a\nwater surface\u201d. This is consistent with a near-Earth neutral\nline injecting Earthward-moving flux into the plasma sheet\n(Cowley, 1984), such as is expected during substorms, and\nexciting the wave.\nOur results suggest that there is a strong link between the\nsubstorm expansion phase and the wavy current sheet, clearly\nshowing that the current sheet wave and expansion of the re-\ngion of dipolarized magnetic field had comparable veloci-\nties, that the cross tail current sheet wave occurred after the\nsubstorm onsets and that the lifetime of the auroral enhance-\nments was comparable with the lifetime of the current sheet\nwaves. However, our results also show the presence of a pe-\nriodic variation orientated in the Z direction in the magneto-\ntail prior to the substorm onset. It is not clear what effect this\nearlier wave had on the generation of the current sheet wave.\nOne possibility is that the excitation of the wavy current sheet\noccurs in two parts. Firstly, the solar wind pressure pulse\ncompresses the magnetosphere, and hence the current sheet.\nThis causes the current sheet to oscillate in the ZGSM direc-\ntion. Following this, two substorms dipolarize the mid-tail.\nThis disruption in the mid-tail changes the magnetic field os-\ncillation from an oscillation in the ZGSM direction to a wave\npropagating in the \u2212YGSM direction with approximately the\nsame period, with the amplitude of the oscillation increas-\ning following each substorm. However, the model of Erkaev\net al. shows that the wave period is dependent on the tail con-\nfiguration and it is unclear what effect, if any, a pre-existing\nwave would have.\nThe similarity between the propagation velocities of the\ncurrent sheet waves, the two dipolarization expansions and\nthe expanding aurora may indicate that the propagation ve-\nlocities of these features are controlled by the configuration\nof the tail defined as in the Erkaev et al. model. Further\nobservations of these features that consider these constraints\nare required to test this hypothesis.\n6 Conclusions\nTwo substorms following a solar wind pressure pulse on 3\nAugust 2001, have been examined in the context of the wavy\ncurrent sheet, as investigated by Zhang et al. (2002). In both\ncases, the dipolarization was seen at geosynchronous orbit by\nGOES 8 and 10 and Polar, and by the Cluster spacecraft in\nthe tail. We have shown that the projected ionospheric veloc-\nities of the expansion of the region of dipolarized magnetic\nfield were consistent with the motion of the substorm auroral\nactivity, confirming that the expansion of the region of dipo-\nlarized magnetic field is related to substorm auroral activity\nand indicating that this is true across large distances in the\ntail.\nFollowing both substorm onsets, Cluster and Polar de-\ntected signatures of a wavy current sheet. Using MVA and\nfour-spacecraft timing analysis, it has been shown that the\ndipolarizations and current sheet waves propagated across\nthe tail with similar velocities. Our results are not able to de-\ntermine whether or not the substorms were the source of the\nwave, since there is evidence of an oscillation of the plasma\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2457\/2009\/ Ann.
