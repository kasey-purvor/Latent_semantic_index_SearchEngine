The most important cultural transition was the adoption of\nagriculture originating in the Fertile Crescent in the Near East at\nthe start of the Neolithic, ,10 KYA [2]. It spread rapidly\nwestwards via Anatolia [3] (Figure 1A), reaching Ireland by 6\nKYA, accompanied by the development of sedentary populations\nand demographic expansion. Debate has focused on whether this\nspread was due to the movement and expansion of Near-Eastern\nfarmers (demic diffusion), or to the transmission of cultural\ninnovation to existing populations (acculturation), who then\nthemselves expanded.\nThe observation of southeast\u2013northwest frequency clines for\n\u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 genetic markers [1,4], autosomal DNA markers [5,6],\nand Y-chromosomal markers [7,8] (though not for mitochondrial\nDNA [mtDNA] [9]) has been used to support the demic diffusion\nmodel. No dates can be automatically attached to these clines,\nhowever, and some [1], detected by principal component analysis,\nmay simply reflect isolation by distance [10]. The direction of\nmovement underlying a cline can also be ambiguous: the high-\nfrequency pole could indicate the area of preexisting substrate least\naffected by a migration originating far away, or the final\ndestination of a wave of migration into thinly populated territory,\nwhere expansion and drift have had their greatest effects [11].\nThe origins of a frequency cline of a lineage can be illuminated\nby analysing the diversity within it. For Y-chromosomal lineages\ndefined by binary markers (haplogroups), this can be done using\nmultiple microsatellites. This approach has been applied to\nhaplogroups E, J [12], and I [13] within Europe, but the major\nwestern European lineage has not yet been focused upon. The\nfrequency of the major western European lineage, haplogroup (hg)\nR1b1b2, follows a cline from 12% in Eastern Turkey to 85% in\nIreland (Figure 1B), and is currently carried by some 110 million\nEuropean men. Previous studies of lineages approximately\nequivalent to hgR1b1b2 [7,8] suggested that it has a Paleolithic\norigin, based simply on its high frequency in the west. Here, in\ncontrast, we show that the geographical distribution of diversity\nwithin the haplogroup is best explained by its spread from a single\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 1 January 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e1000285\nsource from the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic.\nTaken together with the evidence on the origins of many other\nEuropean haplogroups, this indicates that the great majority of the\nY chromosomes of Europeans have their origins in the Neolithic\nexpansion.\nResults\nTo investigate the origins of hgR1b1b2, we assembled a dataset\nof 840 chromosomes from this haplogroup with associated nine-\nlocus microsatellite haplotypes (Table 1; Table S1). The diversity\nof the lineage within each population (measured by mean\nmicrosatellite variance) should reflect its age: under a hypothesis\nof recolonization from southern refugia, we expect a gradient of\ndiversity correlating with latitude, whereas Neolithic expansion\nfrom Anatolia predicts a correlation primarily with longitude.\nFigure 1C shows the geographical distribution of mean microsat-\nellite variance, and Figure 2 shows that although there is no\nevidence for correlation with latitude (R2 = 0.06; p=0.268), the\ncorrelation with longitude is significant (R2 = 0.358; p=0.004),\nwith greatest diversity in the east (strongly influenced by highly\ndiverse samples within Turkey), thus providing support for the\nNeolithic colonization hypothesis.\nThe two hypotheses also make different predictions for the\nnumber of sources of diversity within hgR1b1b2: under the\npostglacial recolonization model, we expect multiple sources,\nwhereas under the Neolithic expansion model, we expect only\none. We can test this by examining the phylogenetic relationships\namong microsatellite haplotypes. A reduced median network of\n859 haplotypes (Figure 3) shows a simple star-like structure\nindicative of expansion from one source: 74 haplotypes (8.6%) lie\nin its central node, and this node plus its single-step mutational\nneighbours together comprise 214 haplotypes (24.9%). Haplo-\ntypes belonging to populations from all three refugia are present\nin the core of the network. This pattern seems incompatible with\nrecolonization from differentiated refugial populations, and in\nterms of the history of hgR1b1b2, the refugia possess no special\nstatus. The core of the network also contains haplotypes from\nAuthor Summary\nArguably the most important cultural transition in the\nhistory of modern humans was the development of\nfarming, since it heralded the population growth that\nculminated in our current massive population size. The\ngenetic diversity of modern populations retains the traces\nof such past events, and can therefore be studied to\nilluminate the demographic processes involved in past\nevents. Much debate has focused on the origins of\nagriculture in Europe some 10,000 years ago, and in\nparticular whether its westerly spread from the Near East\nwas driven by farmers themselves migrating, or by the\ntransmission of ideas and technologies to indigenous\nhunter-gatherers. This study examines the diversity of the\npaternally inherited Y chromosome, focusing on the\ncommonest lineage in Europe. The distribution of this\nlineage, the diversity within it, and estimates of its age all\nsuggest that it spread with farming from the Near East.\nTaken with evidence on the origins of other lineages, this\nindicates that most European Y chromosomes descend\nfrom Near Eastern farmers. In contrast, most maternal\nlineages descend from hunter-gatherers, suggesting a\nreproductive advantage for farming males over indigenous\nhunter-gatherer males during the cultural transition from\nhunting-gathering to farming.\nFigure 1.

Mean\nestimates for individual populations vary (Table 2), but the oldest\nvalue is in Central Turkey (7,989 y [95% confidence interval (CI):\n5,661\u201311,014]), and the youngest in Cornwall (5,460 y [3,764\u2013\n7,777]).

Thus, we see clear evidence of rapid expansion, which\ncannot have begun before the Neolithic period.\nTable 1.

Further support for the association\nof the expansion of hgR1b1b2 with that of farming comes from a\nstatistical comparison of the variables. The frequency of\nhgR1b1b2 at different points in Europe is significantly negatively\ncorrelated (R2 = 0.390; p=0.0005) with the dates of local Neolithic\nsites (Figure 4A). For the local variance of the microsatellite\nhaplotypes within hgR1b1b2, the correlation with Neolithic dates\nis significantly positive (R2 = 0.331; p=0.0124; Figure 4B).\nDiscussion\nPrevious observations of the east\u2013west clinal distribution of the\ncommon Western European hgR1b1b2 (or its equivalent) [7,8]\nconsidered it to be part of a Paleolithic substrate into which farmers\nfrom the Near East had diffused. Later analyses have also considered\nvariance, and have conformed to the Paleolithic explanation [14,15].\nHere, we concur that the cline results from demic diffusion, but our\nevidence supports a different interpretation: that R1b1b2 was\ncarried as a rapidly expanding lineage from the Near East via\nAnatolia to the western fringe of Europe during the Neolithic. Such\nmutations arising at the front of a wave of expansion have a high\nprobability of surviving and being propagated, and can reach high\nfrequencies far from their source [11]. Successive founder effects at\nthe edge of the expansion wave can lead to a reduction in\nmicrosatellite diversity, even as the lineage increases in frequency.\nThe innovations in the Near East also spread along the southern\nshore of the Mediterranean, reflected in the expansion of\nhgE1b1b1b (E-M81) [16], which increases in frequency and\nreduces in diversity from east to west. In sub-Saharan Africa,\nhgE1b1a (E-M2) underwent a massive expansion associated with\nthe Bantu expansion [17,18]. In India, the spread of agriculture\nhas been associated with the introduction of several Y lineages\n[19], and in Japan, lineages within hgO spread with the Yayoi\nmigration [20], which brought wet rice agriculture to the\narchipelago. On a more recent timescale, the expansion of the\nHan culture in China has been linked to demic diffusion [21]. In\nthis context, the apparently low contribution of incoming Y\nchromosomes to the European Neolithic, despite its antiquity and\nFigure 3.

Our interpretation of the history\nof hgR1b1b2 now makes Europe a prime example of how\nexpansion of a Y-chromosomal lineage tends to accompany\ntechnological and cultural change.\nOther lineages also show evidence of European Neolithic\nexpansion, hgE1b1b1 (E-M35) and hgJ, in particular [12]. Indeed,\nhgI is the onlymajor lineage for which a Paleolithic origin is generally\naccepted, but it comprises only 18% of European Y chromosomes\n[13]. The Basques contain only 8%\u201320% of this lineage, but 75%\u2013\n87% hgR1b1b2 (Table S1); our findings therefore challenge their\ntraditional \u2018\u2018Mesolithic relict\u2019\u2019 status, and in particular, their use as a\nproxy for a Paleolithic parental population in admixture modelling of\nEuropean Y-chromosomal prehistory [22].\nIs the predominance of Neolithic-expansion lineages among Y\nchromosomes reflected in other parts of the genome? Mitochon-\ndrial DNA diversity certainly presents a different picture: no east\u2013\nwest cline is discernible, most lineages have a Paleolithic TMRCA\n[23], and hgH [24] and hgV [25] show signatures of postglacial\nexpansion from the Iberian peninsula. Demic diffusion involves\nboth females and males, but the disparity between mtDNA and Y-\nchromosomal patterns could arise from an increased and\ntransmitted reproductive success for male farmers compared to\nindigenous hunter-gatherers, without a corresponding difference\nbetween females from the two groups. This would lead to the\nexpansion of incoming Y lineages\u2014as suggested by the high\ngrowth rate observed for hgR1b1b2. Similar conclusions have\nbeen reached for the Bantu expansion (in which the current\nBantu-speaking populations carry many mtDNA lineages origi-\nnating from hunter-gatherers [26]), the introduction of agriculture\nto India [19] and the Han expansion [21].\nSome studies have found evidence of east\u2013west clines for\nautosomal loci [6,27]. By contrast, recent genome-wide SNP typing\nsurveys [28\u201330] find a basic south\u2013north division or gradient,\nincluding greater diversity in the south, but they provide no\nindication of the time-depth of the underlying events, which could in\nprinciple involve contributions from the original colonization,\npostglacial Paleolithic recolonization, Neolithic expansion, and later\ncontact between Africa and southern Europe [31].\nThe distinction between the geographical patterns of variation\nof the Y chromosome and those of mtDNA suggest sex-specific\nfactors in patterning European diversity, but the rest of the\ngenome has yet to reveal definitive information. Detailed studies of\nX-chromosomal and autosomal haplotypes promise to further\nilluminate the roles of males and females in prehistory.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement\nMales were recruited with informed consent, following ethical\napproval by the Leicestershire Research Ethics Committee and the\nethics committees of the Universities of Ferrara, Pavia, and Exeter\nand Plymouth.\nDNA Samples and Haplotyping\nA total of 2,574 DNA samples from European males, assigned to\npopulations based on two generations of residence, were typed for the\nSNP M269 [17], defining hgR1b1b2.

To avoid a bias from very large\nsamples of hgR1b1b2 (GE and IR), these were randomly subsampled\nto give sample sizes of 75. This allowed a comparison of nine-locus\nhaplotypes (DYS19, DYS388, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390,\nDYS391, DYS392, DYS393, and DYS439) for 849 hgR1b1b2\nchromosomes, subdivided into 23 populations. Greek and Serbian\nsamples were too small for population-based analyses, but were\nincluded in Network analysis.\nAnalysis\nNeolithic dates, frequencies of hgR1b1b2, and local microsat-\nellite variances were displayed using Surfer 8.02 (Golden Software)\nby the gridding method. Latitudes and longitudes were based on\nsampling centres.\nIntrahaplogroup diversity was assessed for populations with\nhgR1b1b2 sample size $15 as the mean of the individual\nmicrosatellite variances [34], as has been done elsewhere (e.g.,\n[35]); this measure is highly correlated (R2 = 0.871; p=6.72610210)\nwith a more conventional measure, average squared distance (ASD)\n[36]. Regression analyses were carried out in the R statistical\npackage [37] to compare these two measures, and also to compare\nmean of variance with latitude and longitude.\nA reduced median network [38] of microsatellite haplotypes was\nconstructed using Network 4.5 and Network Publisher, using\nweighting based on the inverse of the microsatellite variances.\nTMRCA and population growth rates were estimated using\nBATWING [39], under a model of exponential population growth\nand splitting. Whereas standard use of BATWING assumes a\nrandom sample from a population, we validated its use to analyse\nsingle haplogroups. Justification of this, together with other details,\nis given in Text S1.\nTo assess the correlation between the dates of Neolithic sites\nand the local hgR1b1b2 frequency and variance, we considered\n765 sites and their associated calibrated radiocarbon dates\n[3]. We identified sites lying within a buffer-zone of 150-km\nradius around each location for which we had frequency or\nvariance data (Figure 1B and 1C). When more than one site\nwas identified in a given buffer-zone, we considered the mean of\nthe dates.
