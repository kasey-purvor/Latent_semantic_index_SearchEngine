INTRODUCTION29\n30\nEnvironmental regulators (such as the Environment Agency in England and Wales)31\nnow require operators of waste processing plants to submit risk assessments in32\nsupport of environmental permits and licences, or exemption from these forms of33\nregulatory control (Pollard et al., 2006). Risk assessments provide operators with the34\nbasis for operational controls on site and allow them to target controls where35\nexposures to significant risk are of greatest concern. Furthermore, they reassure the36\nregulator and local communities that facilities are being operated safely and37\nresponsibly without undue risks to operational staff, to public health or to the38\nenvironment. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in39\nEngland and Wales has issued overarching guidelines for environmental risk40\nassessment and management (DETR, 2000). The guidelines stress key components of41\nenvironmental risk assessment and management, and provide practical guidelines to42\nrisk assessors. In addition they discuss quality-critical features of risk assessments that43\nare submitted to Defra and its executive agencies.44\n45\nComposting is one such resource recovery process subject to risk assessment in46\nEngland and Wales. In the UK, compost production increased from ca. 1 million47\ntonnes (mt) in 2000\/01 to 2.67 mt by 2004\/05 (Composting Association, 2006). This48\ntrend is set to continue in order to meet the targets set in Defra\u2019s 2007 Waste Strategy49\nfor England (Defra, 2007) and as a result, the number of composting facilities and the50\namount of waste processed will increase. This has led to concerns regarding potential51\nhealth effects during waste processing and particularly those associated with exposure52\nto bioaerosols generated in the process (National Audit Office, 2002). The53\n4Environment Agency (EA) is responsible for regulating composting facilities within54\nEngland and Wales. Their current policy position on what are being termed55\nbioaerosol risk assessments, is that56\n57\n\u201cThere will be a presumption against permitting of any new composting58\nprocess [or any modification to an existing process] where the boundary of59\nthe facility is within 250 m of a workplace or the boundary of a dwelling,60\nunless the application is accompanied by a site-specific risk assessment,61\nbased on clear, independent scientific evidence which shows that the62\nbioaerosol levels are and can be maintained at appropriate levels at the63\ndwelling or workplace\u201d (EA, 2001; 2008)64\n65\nThe suggested threshold limits for bioaerosols are 300, 1000 and 1000 CFU m-3 for66\ngram-negative bacteria, total bacteria and total fungi respectively (Wheeler et al.,67\n2001). Appropriate levels of bioaerosols is therefore considered in relation to these68\nsuggested threshold levels and in relation to background concentrations (either69\nupwind or concentrations measure before the site was operational if available).70\n71\nThe policy has encouraged the submission of bioaerosol risk assessments by72\ncomposting facility operators and their environmental consultants. Here we review the73\nquality of these assessments as part of an ongoing programme of bioaerosol research74\n(Taha et al., 2006; 2007; Wheeler et al., 2001) that will increase our understanding of75\nbioaerosol generation, dispersion and their impact on receptors. The responsibility for76\ninterpreting site-specific risk assessments falls to EA regulatory staff. At a recent EA77\nsponsored bioaerosol workshop, a lack of inter-comparability between risk78\n5assessments was highlighted as a potential influence on the consistency of regulatory79\ndecisions (EA, 2006; Sykes et al., 2007).80\n81\nIn this paper, we provide a constructive critique of bioaerosol risk assessments in the82\nUK. To our knowledge, this is the first synthesis of its kind. It provides valuable83\ninsight into the qualities of existing assessments and indicates where opportunities for84\nimprovement exist. Such analysis will be used to inform forthcoming regulatory85\nguidance. A series of workshops are underway to convey these results to Agency86\nstaff and external interested parties.87\n88\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS89\n2.1. Rationale90\n91\nWe sought to distinguish those features addressed adequately by the risk assessments92\nfrom those addressed less adequately. We were interested in features that were93\nsystematically performed competently, or conversely those uniformly treated in less94\ndepth. Our intent was to inform regulatory guidance accordingly, allowing for certain95\naspects to be given greater attention. Forty-four (n = 44) composting and bioaerosol96\nrisk assessments submitted to the EA were assessed. These included a mixture of97\nboth full environmental risk assessments as well as more focussed bioaerosol98\nmonitoring reports, with accompanying statements on risk. This essentially created99\ntwo separate groups of reports that were assessed as such. As two bioaerosol100\nmonitoring reports did not include full statements on risk, these were assessed only on101\ntheir bioaerosol attributes. The samples sizes for the general attributes (n=42) and102\nbioaerosol attributes (n=44) were therefore different. The assessments were103\n6completed by 25 different environmental consultants for 37 different facility operators104\nacross the UK. The risk assessments were completed between December 2000 and105\nOctober 2007. For four of the sites, a second risk assessment or follow-up monitoring106\nexercise was included. The sites included a mixture of in-vessel and open windrow107\ntechnologies, treating a variety of organic wastes.108\n109\n2.2. Development of risk assessment attributes.110\n111\nKey attributes, selected on the basis of their prominence in existing guidance (DETR,112\n2000), our understanding of their importance to informing risk-based decisions113\n(Pollard et al., 2006) and in consultation with policy staff, are listed in Table 1.114\nAttributes were selected as being general characteristics of risk assessments, as well115\nas those specific to composting and bioaerosols. The more general risk assessments116\ndid not all include a section focussed on bioaerosols, so these risk assessments were117\nonly evaluated on the general risk assessment characteristics and not the composting118\nor bioaerosol specific attributes. Within these groupings (Table 1), attributes were119\ncharacterised as either major or minor. For example, \u201cproblem definition\u201d is120\nfundamental to describing the circumstances and rationale for any risk assessment,121\nand is a major attribute. \u201cIdentification of other emissions\u201d allows us to examine the122\nwider risks associated with a composting facility, but is not fundamental to describing123\nthe risks associated with bioaerosols released from a composting facility so is a minor124\nattribute.125\n126\n72.3. Scoring the features of risk assessments.127\n128\nA linear scoring method was developed for appraising the assessments. The attributes129\nwere scored qualitatively. Typically, a scale of 1 to 4 was used to describe the degree130\nof attention ascribed to that feature of the risk assessment, from \u201cnot examined\u201d131\nthrough to \u201cfully examined\u201d. Some attributes could only be scored using a binary132\n\u201cyes\/no\u201d evaluation on a scale of 1 to 2 (Table 1). The scores for each attribute were133\ntotalled to give a general and a bioaerosol score for each assessment, which was then134\nused to rank the risk assessments. This provided not only a quality score for each risk135\nassessment, but allowed an assessment of individual attributes across the sample (n =136\n44). Triangulation in the assessment was achieved by having the risk assessments137\nanalysed by two different assessors, with a third assessor providing a quality control138\nfunction. This third assessor analysed a selection (18%) of the risk assessments and139\nthe results were compared with the analyses of the first two assessors. The results140\nfrom the third assessor were found to be within +\/-10% of the results from the first141\ntwo assessors, confirming a general consistency in the analysis of all three assessors.142\n143\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION144\n3.1. Overall results.145\n146\nThe range of possible scores for the general and bioaerosol attributes was 11 to 34 and147\n11 to 32, respectively. The result of the scoring system for the general attributes148\nranged from 12 to 29, with a mean of 20. For the bioaerosol\/composting attributes,149\nthe range was 12 to 27, with a mean of 18. The results presented below reveal that the150\nquality of risk assessments submitted to the EA is highly variable. Despite an151\n8increase in research focusing on bioaerosols, there has not been an improvement in152\nquality between 2000 and 2007 (Figure 1). This may well be because interpretation of153\nthe various guidance documents (e.g. DETR, 2000) aimed at providing a common154\nframework for risk assessments is frequently left to individual consultants working on155\nbehalf of operators, resulting in a wide variety of methods being applied. This could156\nalso reflect a lack of clarity in the guidance currently available.157\n158\n3.2. General attribute results159\n160\nThe general attributes were evaluated individually, providing an indication of where161\nthe practitioners are focusing their efforts currently, and where more effort needs to be162\nexerted. Figure 2 shows the average scores for each of the general risk assessment163\nattributes. However, as the maximum score for each attribute varied (Table 1), it was164\nnecessary to examine the average attribute score as a percentage of the maximum165\nscore for that attribute (Figure 3). The results reveal that the attributes that are166\nadequately covered include \u201clogical\/transparent\u201d, \u201cidentification of other emissions\u201d,167\n\u201cproblem definition\u201d and \u201coptions appraisal\u201d. Further examination of the results168\nshows that the majority of the risk assessments (30, n=42) were classified as logical,169\nand identified other emissions such as odour (29). In addition, most practitioners170\nprovided a full (17) or partial (13) description of the problem. Most practitioners also171\nincluded a full (16) or partial (13) appraisal of mitigation or control measures (options172\nappraisal), although the effort was related to the risk in only 19 of the risk assessments173\nconsidered.174\n175\n9Risk screening and prioritisation is an area where further work is required, with 20176\n(n=42) of the risk assessments providing only a partial description and only seven177\nproviding a full description (Figure 3). Although the magnitude of the consequences178\nwas either partially (14) or fully examined (7), for the majority of the risk179\nassessments, the probability of the consequences was either not estimated (17) or180\nunderestimated (12) (Figure 3).181\n182\nThe first area identified as requiring more effort is the diagrams, where the majority183\nwere either not useful (11, n=42) or there were no diagrams (21) (Figure 3). One of184\nthe key issues was the absence of a scale on diagrams, which prevented accurate185\nassessment of the proximity of sensitive receptors. The other common issue was the186\nlack of detail of site plans, particularly information such as location of activities and187\nany trees or screens around the site that could mitigate emissions. Diagrams should188\nprovide a scaled, accurate plan of the site, showing buildings, screens, bunding,189\nlocation of on site activities and compost windrows. In addition, a scaled,190\ntopographical diagram showing the location of sensitive receptors in relation to the191\nsite is required. A conceptual model of the site is valuable, but rarely present, in the192\nrisk assessments.193\n194\nStating the limitations and uncertainties within a risk assessment explains why some195\naspects may have been covered and others not. It should describe where the author of196\nthe risk assessment knows data is lacking, for example, in the reliability of the data197\ngathered. The overwhelming majority (35, n=42) of assessments undertaken by198\npractitioners did not state or discuss any limitations or uncertainties of their work199\n(Figure 3). In addition, not one risk assessment provided any evidence of stakeholder200\n10\ninvolvement in the process. Stakeholder involvement, although not mandatory, does201\nprovide the practitioner with local knowledge, such as the location and activities of202\nparticularly sensitive receptors. This information could be useful in designing203\nmitigation measures, for example, not undertaking agitation activities under periods204\nwhen high wind speeds would direct emissions towards sensitive receptors. In205\naddition, consulting with local stakeholders can provide a sound basis for future206\nrelationships by involving them in the decision making process.207\n208\nStating the limitations and uncertainties, involving stakeholders, and the use of209\nappropriate diagrams and site plans, have therefore been identified as the main general210\nattributes of composting risk assessments that require improvement.211\n212\n3.3. Bioaerosol composting attributes213\n214\nExamination of the bioaerosol attributes (Figure 4) revealed that, in general, these215\nattributes are given less attention than the general attributes. The only adequately216\ndescribed composting attribute was the identification of sensitive receptors within 250217\nm of the facility, with 18 (n=44) providing a full identification and a further 21218\nproviding at least a partial identification of sensitive receptors (Figure 5). Lack of219\nstakeholder involvement suggests the identification of sensitive receptors may give220\nrise to bias.221\n222\nBioaerosol and composting risk assessments should contain a description of the223\nprocess and a site specific identification of all sources, pathways and receptors. Of224\nthe risk assessments analysed, only eight (n=44) provided a full, accurate and site225\n11\nspecific description of the sources, pathways and receptors, with the majority226\nproviding either inaccurate or partial (i.e. not site specific) descriptions only (Figure227\n5).228\n229\nIn terms of bioaerosol sampling, 24 (n=44) of the risk assessments did not provide230\nany description of the sampling methods, 21 sampled fewer organisms than suggested231\nby the Composting Association (1999), and 27 did not use the culture techniques232\nsuggested by the Composting Association (1999) (Figure 5). Although other233\nsampling techniques do exist, the Composting Association (1999) method is the234\nstandard protocol recommended within England and Wales, and as such should be235\nused as a minimum. Practitioners using other methods should be able to demonstrate236\ncomparability with the Composting Association (1999) standard protocol. In237\naddition, 28 did not discuss the assumptions regarding their sampling strategy and 31238\n(Figure 5) did not identify any other potential sources of bioaerosols that could have239\ncontributed to the overall emissions, for example, agricultural activities nearby. A240\nhigh proportion of practitioners (25) had not monitored the background (e.g. upwind)241\nconcentration of bioaerosols; and in 19 of the risk assessments, the information242\npresented was not relevant to that facility. The majority of practitioners (29) did not243\ngive any indication that they intended to revisit the risk assessment. Finally, 24 of the244\nrisk assessments gave no summary of the health risks associated with bioaerosols at245\nthe composting facility.246\n247\nThe absence of details regarding sampling methodology restricts the interpretation of248\nthe bioaerosol concentrations. Conditions on-site during sampling can affect249\nbioaerosol concentrations, for example, agitation activities have been shown to250\n12\nincrease bioaerosol concentrations (Taha et al., 2006). Meteorological conditions will251\nalso affect bioaerosol emission and dispersion. Higher winds will carry bioaerosols252\nfurther downwind, while turbulent conditions will enhance drop-out and dilute253\nconcentrations. Therefore bioaerosol concentrations presented without this254\ninformation may be interpreted out of context.255\n256\nThe results of this analysis suggest that while most practitioners are capable of257\nundertaking a generic risk assessment, there is a distinct lack of site specific258\ninformation and a disregard for the importance of bioaerosols in composting risk259\nassessments. In many cases, the limitations are associated with a reluctance to260\nundertake full bioaerosol monitoring, possibly due to the costs associated with261\nmonitoring. Many of the risk assessments were therefore based on data monitored at262\nother sites, where conditions are unlikely to be the same. In the case of new or non-263\noperational sites, this may be the only data available. However it is still important to264\nmonitor background concentrations to establish the baseline conditions. The absence265\nof bioaerosol monitoring data in composting risk assessments results in inaccurate266\nestimates of the risks of that particular site. In addition, risk assessments based on267\ninformation from different sites are unlikely to provide an accurate picture of the risk268\nassociated with the site in question, due to differences in meteorology and269\ntopography, which will have an impact on bioaerosol concentrations. Therefore, on-270\nsite monitoring is essential, not only for the implementation of appropriate271\nmanagement techniques, but also to allow for fair and consistent regulatory decision272\nmaking.273\n274\n13\n4. CONCLUSIONS275\nThis analysis illustrates that the majority of composting risk assessments do not276\nadequately examine the risk associated with bioaerosols, although the descriptions of277\nthe general risk assessments attributes are adequate, as evidenced by the number of278\nattributes (7 out of 11 attributes) that were adequately covered in most risk279\nassessments. Although the aim of this exercise was to identify good and bad practice,280\nno ideal examples were identified. Instead, we found that the majority of risk281\nassessments consisted of both good and bad parts, with many scoring rather poorly.282\nIn order to find a perfect example of good practice, parts of different risk assessments283\nwould need to be collated. Sections of different risk assessments that display good284\npractice have been highlighted in a series of workshops held for EA personnel. This285\ninformation is being used to develop guidance to assist EA officers in assessing risk286\nassessments.287\n288\nThe most important problem with the risk assessments was the lack of site specific289\ndata. Given that bioaerosol concentrations vary greatly depending on local290\nconditions, season, sampling methods and on-site activities (ADAS, 2005; Taha et al.,291\n2006; 2007), it is difficult to justify using data from a site that is unlikely to have292\nsimilar bioaerosol sources. However, where sites are not yet operational, it is still293\nuseful to monitor for bioaerosols to gain an understanding of the baseline data294\nassociated with other activities in the area. Admittedly, this would probably only be a295\nsingle snapshot, but in the absence of more advanced methods for monitoring296\nbioaerosols, this would be the best available background data for a new composting297\nfacility. Furthermore, practitioners need to follow the existing guidance in terms of298\nsampling procedures at the very minimum, and clearly describe their practice,299\n14\nincluding any assumptions and limitations within the risk assessment. The data and300\ninformation presented should be relevant and concise. Describing the general process301\nof undertaking a risk assessment for example is not necessary, as this is provided in302\nthe guidance documents.303\n304\nIn summary, the key elements of composting risk assessment where additional305\ninformation should be provided are:306\n\uf0b7 site specific information, specifically bioaerosols monitored upwind307\n(preferably 50-100m), adjacent to both static compost windrows and to compost308\nagitation activities, downwind and at sensitive receptors within 250m;309\n\uf0b7 detailed descriptions of conditions during sampling (on-site activities, age of310\ncompost, moisture content of compost and meteorological conditions such as311\nseason, wind speed, wind direction and relative humidity); and312\n\uf0b7 appropriate expert interpretation to justify the decisions reached, including313\nstating any limitations, uncertainties and assumptions.314\n315\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS316\nGHD is an Environment Agency-supported postdoctoral fellow (Science project P1-317\n514).
