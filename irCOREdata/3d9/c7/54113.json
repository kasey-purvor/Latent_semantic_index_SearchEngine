Introduction \n \nVariability in the bioaccumulation of radionuclides from water to aquatic organisms is an \nimportant source of uncertainty in generic models for the prediction of radiation doses both to \nhumans and aquatic biota (Monte et al., 2003; Yankovich et al., 2010). Bioaccumulation \nfactors (here termed the concentration ratio, CR) for key short-lived radionuclides such as 131I \nand 32,33P may be over-estimated since they are often based on values for the corresponding \nstable isotope which do not account for radioactive decay during uptake via the food chain. \nThis study presents estimates for bioaccumulation factors of radioactive phosphorus which \naccount for both radioactive decay and varying ambient levels of stable P in the environment. \nThe concentration ratio for aquatic biota is defined here as: \n \n\u0725\u0734 \u0d4c \u0bba\u0bd6\u0be7\u0bdc\u0be9\u0bdc\u0be7\u0bec \u0bd6\u0be2\u0be1\u0bd6\u0bd8\u0be1\u0be7\u0be5\u0bd4\u0be7\u0bdc\u0be2\u0be1 \u0be3\u0bd8\u0be5 \u0bde\u0bda \u0be2\u0bd9 \u0bd9\u0bdc\u0be6\u0bdb \u123a\u0bd9\u0be5\u0bd8\u0be6\u0bdb \u0bea\u0be7\u123b\n\u0bba\u0bd6\u0be7\u0bdc\u0be9\u0bdc\u0be7\u0bec \u0bd6\u0be2\u0be1\u0bd6\u0bd8\u0be1\u0be7\u0be5\u0bd4\u0be7\u0bdc\u0be2\u0be1 \u0be3\u0bd8\u0be5 \u0bdf\u0bdc\u0be7\u0be5\u0bd8 \u0be2\u0bd9 \u0bea\u0bd4\u0be7\u0bd8\u0be5\n       l kg-1   (1) \n \nThe CR assessment carried out here will use the River Cam at Cambridge, UK, as a case \nstudy, but generalised interim CR values will also be determined for other rivers, based on \nuptake of stable P.  \n \nIt is known that the bioaccumulation of radioactivity in fish is determined by numerous \necological and environmental factors such as the trophic level of the fish species, the length \nof the food chain, water temperature and water chemistry (for example, Smith et al., 2002). \nFor radionuclides which have a suitable stable element (for example, 14C) or a close stable \nelement analogue (for example, potassium for 134,137Cs) the bioaccumulation of the stable \nelement is a valuable guide to that of the radioisotope. If the rate of accumulation of a \nradionuclide is rapid in comparison to the radioactive decay time (i.e. if equilibrium is \nreached before much of the radionuclide has decayed), then the CR for the radioactive \nelement will be close to that of the stable element. However, it is known (for example, Elliott \n- 3 - \n \net al., 1992; Smith et al., 2005) that radionuclide uptake in aquatic food chains can take place \nover timescales of months or greater. Therefore, for short-lived radionuclides, such as 131I \n(T1\/2 = 8.02 days) and 32,33P (T1\/2 = 14.26 and 25.34 days respectively), CR values based on \nstable analogue elements are likely to give overestimates of the bioaccumulation of the \nradioactive element. \n \nPhosphorus is an essential nutrient for all organisms, being a key component of phospholipid \ncell membranes, DNA and RNA, and of ATP, used to transport energy within the cell. \nPhosphorus is also deposited in the bones of vertebrate animals. Kryshev (2004) quotes \nSaurov et al. (Saurov et al., 1973) who found in experiments that 70% of 32P is accumulated \nin the bones and 30% in soft tissues. Phosphorus is homeostatically regulated in organisms: \nin other words, P is assimilated to the level needed and excess P is excreted from the body. \nThis means that body concentrations of P remain relatively stable. Bioaccumulation of \nradioactive phosphorus is determined by the availability of stable P, with high accumulation \nof radiophosphorus being observed in low stable P systems (for example, Poston and Klopfer, \n1986).  \n \nIn evaluating the uptake of radionuclides in farmed fish, is also important to consider the \naccumulation pathway of the radio-element since (presuming that they are fed radioactively \n\u201cclean\u201d food), uptake to farmed fish via the food chain will be of minor importance. \nTherefore, if the food chain is the dominant radiophosphorus accumulation pathway \n(compared to direct uptake from water), then recommended CR values for wild fish are likely \nto over-estimate uptake of radionuclides to farmed fish. The relative importance of these two \nuptake pathways will therefore be considered in this study. \n \n1.1. Current recommended value of the radiophosphorus-water CR \n \nThe International Atomic Energy Agency recommended value (IAEA, 1994) for the \nradiophosphorus concentration ratio in \u201cedible portions\u201d of fish was previously 5 \u00d7 104 l kg-1, \nwith a range 3 \u00d7 103 - 1 \u00d7 105 l kg-1. The recent revision to this document (IAEA, 2010) \nrecommends a value of 1.4 \u00d7 105 l kg-1 (range 1.2-1.7  \u00d7 105 l kg-1) for fish muscle, this value \npresumably being based on the stable P CR. It is notable that the latter (IAEA, 2010) study \nrecommends a much narrower range of possible values than the former (IAEA, 1994). Using \n- 4 - \n \nthe recommended correction factor to account for decay of short-lived radionuclides (IAEA, \n2010), the stable P CR of 1.4 \u00d7 105 l kg-1 would lead to recommended CRs of 4.5 \u00d7 104 l kg-1 \nfor 32P and 6.4 \u00d7 104 l kg-1 for 33P, values very close to that recommended in the earlier \n(IAEA, 1994) review.  \nIt is likely that these conservative estimates are for relatively low stable P concentration \nsystems in which bioaccumulation of the available P is particularly high. Many lowland \nrivers have elevated P concentrations from anthropogenic sources (primarily diffuse \nagricultural runoff and point sources from sewage treatment works) (Bowes et al., 2010; Foy, \n2007; White and Hammond, 2009). The IAEA (1994) best estimate and range appears to be \nbased on a literature review by Poston et al. (1986) and an earlier review by Kahn and \nTurgeon (1980; cited; Poston and Klopfer, 1986). According to Poston and Knopfler (1986), \nKahn and Turgeon (1980) \u201crecommend a CR of 3000 [l kg-1] for 32P and 70,000 [l kg-1] for \nstable P\u201d, the difference being due to decay of 32P as it accumulates up the aquatic food \nchain. It was not possible to consult the Kahn and Turgeon (1980) report directly, but a later \npaper by these authors (Kahn and Turgeon, 1984) describes the derivation of the \nconcentration factor for stable and radioactive P. The stable P CR is obtained (using Equation \n2, below) from a review of phosphorus concentrations in fish muscle (assumed value 2.2 g\/kg \nf.w) and in the dissolved phase of river waters (assumed value 0.03 mg l-1). In their later \npaper, Kahn and Turgeon (1984) use a model for phosphorus turnover in fish to infer a CR \nwhich is 20 times lower than that for stable P (i.e. 3500 l kg-1). This latter value is close to \nthat quoted by Poston and Knopfler (1986) based on the earlier Kahn and Turgeon (1980) \nstudy.  \n \n2. Methods \n \n2.1. Literature search \nA literature search was carried out to critically assess the available information on the \nbioaccumulation of both stable and radioactive phosphorus. Estimates of the fish-water CR \nmay be made from measurements (in the lab or field) reported in the literature. Alternatively, \nin appropriate cases, CR may be estimated from the concentration factor of the stable isotope \n(assuming instantaneous uptake of P by the organism, and therefore, for the moment, \nignoring radioactive decay): \n- 5 - \n \n)(.\n)(.)()33,32( 1\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\u2248\u2212\nlkgwaterinPstableavailableofConc\nkgkgorganisminPstableofConcPstableCRPCR\n       (2) \nwhere we have ignored the minor effects of P mass discrimination. \n \nThe equilibrium CR modelling approach is appropriate for cases in which the radionuclide \nactivity concentration in fish can be assumed to be in equilibrium with that in water, for \nexample at long times (years) after radionuclide fallout, or for continuous releases of \nradionuclides to a river.  \n \n \n2.2. Modelling \nThe modelling approach is similar to those presented in, for example, Kryshev (2004) and \nSmith et al. (Smith, 2006; 2002), being based on an evaluation of concentrations and \nuptake\/excretion rates of stable phosphorus. For comparison with other modelling \napproaches, a review of models for uptake of radionuclides in different biotic components of \nlake ecosystems is given by Monte et al. (2003). \nIn this study, a relatively conservative approach was taken in which the aquatic food chain \nwas divided into three levels. The first level consisted of macrophytes, phyto- and zoo-\nplankton, algae, and macroinvertebrates. The second level consisted of small, omnivorous \nfish and the third of larger predatory fish. It was assumed (see Uptake and Excretion Rates \nsection, below) that the transfer of radioactive phosphorus from water to the first trophic level \nis effectively instantaneous. This conservative approach under-emphasises the important role \ndetritus plays in the food chain of many river systems. A significant contribution of detritus \nin the food web of a river will tend to retard radiophosphorus uptake to fish much more than \nis predicted by the simplified model used here. Assimilation of radioactive P in detritus at the \nbottom of the river, breakdown of that detritus and uptake by bacteria, invertebrates and \ndetritivorous fish is likely to significantly retard uptake of radioactive P by fish and hence \nreduce activity concentrations in predatory fish (compared to those predicted by the \nsimplified food chain model used here). \n \n- 6 - \n \nThe concentration in water, Cw (Bq l-1) and the three biota compartments C1, C2, C3 (Bq kg-1) \nare mediated by the forward, kfn, and backward, kbn, rate constants where n is the trophic level \n(see Figure 1). Note that kf1 has dimensions of [length3 mass-1 time-1], but all other rate \nconstants have dimensions of [time-1].

The solutions equal those for stable phosphorus uptake for the special case: \u03bb = \n0. \n \n2.4. Model parameterisation \n2.4.1. Stable P in freshwater organisms \nThe uptake and excretion rates of radioactive phosphorus were estimated by evaluating the \naccumulation of stable phosphorus in aquatic biota. A literature review was conducted to \nobtain conservative values of the stable P concentration in biota in the three trophic levels, \nand values of the stable phosphorus assimilation efficiency (Table 1). It is noted that there \n- 8 - \n \nwas significant variation in stable P concentrations. These data imply that the highest P \nconcentrations are found in relatively large fish, though size-related bio-magnification of P \nconcentrations appears not to be high. Based on the information in Table 1, the stable P \nconcentrations in organisms that are used in the modelling are presented in Table 2, using the \ntrophic level scheme described in the Modelling section above. \nIn addition to the data for whole fish presented in Table 1, a review of stable P content in fish \nmuscle by (Kahn and Turgeon, 1984) estimated a geometric mean of 2.2 g kg-1 f.w. This is \nlower than the value we have assumed here (10 g kg-1 f.w. for predatory fish) for whole fish \n(i.e. including skeleton). P concentrations in muscle are expected to be significantly lower \nthan those in bone, which has a mean P concentration of 24 g kg-1 f.w. (Kahn and Turgeon, \n1984), giving a bone:muscle concentration ratio of 11. This compares with a study by \nYankovich (2009) who reported a literature value of bone:muscle CR of 16 compared to a \nmean value in Perch Lake, Canada of 46.3. \n \n2.4.2. Stable P concentration in water \n \nSince phosphorus is homeostatically controlled in organisms, the fish-phosphorus CR (for \nboth stable and radioactive forms) is strongly dependent on available stable P concentration \nin water. Stable phosphorus concentrations vary widely in surface waters due to differing \ncatchment geology, soil types, catchment and waterbody characteristics and human impacts. \nConcentrations in different water bodies can range from a few \u00b5g l-1 to a few mg l-1. \nPhosphorus may be measured as Total Phosphorus (TP, the P both in the dissolved phase and \nthe less readily bio-available P absorbed to or incorporated in suspended particles), Total \nDissolved Phosphorus (inorganic PO43- and HPO42-, plus some low molecular weight organic \nphosphorus) or Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP, the readily bioavailable inorganic \nphosphate and hydrogen phosphate, plus some colloidal particulate P with a particle diameter \nof less than 0.45\u00b5m). For the purposes of estimating CR values of radioactive P, \nmeasurements of dissolved phosphorus or SRP were used, as these are estimates of the \nfractions that are readily available for bio-accumulation.  \nIn the River Cam, P concentrations are relatively high: the average stable P from 2001 to \n2005 at two sites (Bottisham Lock, Dimmocks Cote Road Bridge) was approximately 0.49 \nmg l-1 (S.E. 0.03 mg l-1) (from data provided by Environment Agency; J.Titley, pers. \n- 9 - \n \ncommun.). Note that this was measurement of phosphate (PO4) and the concentrations are \nhere presented as mg l-1 of P.  \n \n \n2.4.3. Phosphorus assimilation efficiency \nPhosphorus assimilation at low trophic levels is expected to be very high, for example, 32P \nassimilation efficiency of freshwater insect larvae (Chaoborus trivittatus) has been found to \nbe approximately 80% (Giguere, 1981). The assimilation of radioactive phosphorus by fish is \nexpected to be dependent on the availability of stable phosphorus in the diet. In an \nexperiment in which fish (brown trout) were fed pellets containing 32P, only a small fraction \n(0.2-0.4%) was incorporated into muscle (Winpenny et al., 1998). It may be that this low \nassimilation efficiency was due to a relatively high stable P concentration in the commercial \nfeed pellet (8.3 mg g-1). The report (Winpenny et al., 1998) cites an earlier study by Nelson \n(Nelson, 1961) which showed assimilation efficiencies approximately 25 times higher than \nthis. \n \nIt is possible also to estimate assimilation efficiency on the basis of food ingestion and \ngrowth rates of fish, if the P content of feed can be estimated. For a 500g brown trout at a \nwater temperature of 12oC, equations given in Elliott (Elliott, 1975) estimate a growth rate of \n1.65 g d-1 (fresh weight) at a maximum feeding rate of 11.8 g d-1 (fresh weight). Assuming \nthe phosphorus content of the feed to be approximately half that of the trout (see Table 2), \nthis implies a P assimilation efficiency of approximately 28%. This method of estimating \nassimilation efficiency will tend to under-estimate actual assimilation efficiencies as it \naccounts only for that fraction of assimilated stable P contributing to growth. The fraction \nwhich is assimilated and then subsequently excreted is not accounted for. Direct laboratory \nmeasurements of P assimilation efficiency (Nakashima and Leggett, 1980) have found a \nsignificantly higher assimilation efficiency of 72% (S.D. 7.2, N = 12) in yellow perch. \n \nIn view of the wide range in assimilation efficiencies measured, and of the potentially very \nhigh P assimilation efficiency (Nakashima and Leggett, 1980), we here conservatively \n- 10 - \n \nassume that all P ingested by the fish is assimilated (i.e. that the assimilation efficiency is \n100%). \n \n \n \n2.4.4. Uptake and excretion rates \nA previous study by Smith (2006) presented a method for determining uptake and excretion \nrates of radionuclides in fish. Rates of uptake and excretion of radionuclides, kfn, kbn may be \nestimated using field and\/or laboratory experiments, or using estimates of fish feeding rates \nand stable P content.  \n \nThe rate of uptake of phosphorus to aquatic vegetation, algae, phyto- and zoo-plankton is \nrelatively rapid, but highly variable between species. For freshwater phytoplankton, Seip and \nReynolds (Seip and Reynolds, 1995) report population growth rates of 1.3-5.5 d-1 (population \ndoubling times of 0.13-0.53 days) implying very rapid growth and hence very rapid \nassimilation and turnover of phosphorus. By inspection of Equations (2, 10), it can be seen \nthat, if the rate of excretion of P is greater than the radioactive decay rate (kb1 >> \u03bb), then the \nconcentration factor of radioactive P is close to that of stable P.  We have therefore here \nassumed a rapid excretion rate, kb1, of 1 d-1 for the first trophic level leading (relative to the \n32P or 33P physical decay rate) to effectively instantaneous equilibrium between water and the \nfirst trophic level. This may in some cases lead to over-estimation of radioactive P \nconcentration factors in fish (for example, for fish feeding primarily on aquatic insects or \nslower-growing aquatic macrophytes), but it is an appropriate conservative approach at this \nstage. \n \nFor phosphorus uptake to fish via ingestion of food, we can estimate the uptake rate using the \nfollowing equation (adapted from Smith (2006)): \n \n\u0747\u0bd9\u0b36 \u074b\u074e \u0747\u0bd9\u0b37 \u0d4c\n\u0726\u0be0\u0bd4\u0beb \u0d48 \u07d9\n\u0753\n \n     (15) \n \n- 11 - \n \nwhere Dmax (g d-1) is the maximum daily intake (wet weight) of food, w is the wet weight of \nfish in grammes and \u03b1 is the assimilation efficiency (the fraction of amount ingested which is \nabsorbed by the fish). \n \nIt was assumed that fish feed at their maximum daily rate and calculations were made for \ntrout, Salmo trutta, a fish about which there is good data on feeding rates. Elliott (Elliott, \n1975) developed an empirical model which estimates trout feeding rate for fish of different \nwet weight w (grammes) at different water temperatures, T: \n  \n )exp()104( 3\n3\nmax\n1 TbwAD bD \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7= \u2212    (16) \n \nwhere AD, b1 and b3 are empirically determined constants whose values are given by Elliott \n(1975). The factor 4 converts the dry weight feeding rates estimated by the Elliot (1975) \nmodel to feeding rate expressed in terms of wet weight as used in Equation (16). The factor \n10-3 converts Dmax in mg per day estimated by the Elliot model to g per day used in Equation \n(15). \n \nThe excretion parameters for the second and third trophic levels, kb2, kb3, may be estimated \nusing the relations between these parameters and the equilibrium concentration factors of \nstable P (Equations 13, 14 with \u03bb=0): \n \n 2\n2\n1\n2\n)1(\n)2(\nb\nf\nk\nk\nC\nC\nleveltrophicCF\nleveltrophicCF ==\n    (17) \n \n3\n3\n2\n3\n)2(\n)3(\nb\nf\nk\nk\nC\nC\nleveltrophicCF\nleveltrophicCF ==\n    (18) \n \n \nBrown trout were chosen as a fish for which there are good data on feeding rates at different \nwater temperatures and weights of fish. The species is common in England and Wales, \nthough it tends to be found in rivers which are relatively unpolluted and unimpacted by river \nengineering. It may not, therefore, be found at all sites for which assessments of \nradiophosphorus uptake is required. For the purposes of this study, however, it needs only to \nserve to provide realistic growth rates for fish species typically found. Since the feeding rates \n- 12 - \n \ngiven here are maximum values, it is believed that these will be representative of other \nspecies of fish at the sizes (10 g for trophic level 2 and 500 g for trophic level 3) appropriate \nto this study. \n \n \n \n2.4.5. Summary of model input parameters and assumptions \n \nIt is assumed that: \n \n1. The phosphorus assimilation efficiency is 100%; \n2. All of the radiophosphorus discharged to the river is in bioavailable forms and none is \nretarded by bed sediments; \n3. The average weight of trophic level 2 and 3 fish is 10g and 500g, respectively; \n4. Model output is predicted mean activity concentration in a given population of fish at \na particular time; \n5. Model output is presented as Bq kg-1 (f.w.) 32P or 33P in whole fish (i.e including bone \nand scales) or muscle tissue.  \n \n \n3. Results and Discussion \n \nFor the example scenario of a river with average dissolved P equal to 0.49 mg l-1 (the average \nfor the River Cam), changes in 32P and 33P activity concentrations in aquatic biota at different \ntrophic levels were calculated, assuming a constant 1 Bq l-1 activity concentration of each of \nthese radionuclides in water. It was assumed that, at time zero, activity concentrations in \nwater and aquatic organisms were equal to zero. Example model predictions for this scenario \nare shown in Figures 2 and 3 which assume average water temperatures of 12 (spring) and \n17oC (summer). Accumulation of radioactive phosphorus is more rapid at higher water \ntemperatures leading to higher CR values at higher water temperature. The resulting 33P CR is \ngreater (at all water temperatures) than that of 32P, owing to the slower radioactive decay rate \nof 33P. \n \n3.1. Recommended interim CR values for 32P and 33P \n- 13 - \n \n \nThe IAEA (1994, 2010) recommended CR for radioactive P (ca. 50,000 l kg-1), is likely to be \na significant over-estimate for many aquatic systems and particularly for lowland rivers in \nEngland and Wales (and other rivers impacted by P from intensive agriculture and urban \ndevelopment). Firstly, stable P concentrations in lowland rivers of England and Wales tend to \nbe significantly higher than the 0.03 mg l-1 assumed by Kahn and Turgeon (Kahn and \nTurgeon, 1984). A survey of English rivers draining to the North Sea in the mid- to late- \n1990\u2019s found annual average SRP concentrations to range from 0.06 to 1.8 mg l-1 with the \nrange in lowland rivers being 0.14 \u2013 1.8 mg l-1 (Neal and Robson, 2000); stable dissolved P in \nthe River Cam averages around 0.49 mg l-1. The Environment Agency phosphorus water \nquality target for lowland rivers on alluvial or clay catchments in England and Wales is an \nannual average of 0.10 mg l-1 (Mainstone and Parr, 2002). Secondly, as noted by Kahn and \nTurgeon (1984), CR values determined by using the stable isotope analogue need to be \ncorrected to account for the decay of 32P and 33P during assimilation through the aquatic food \nchain.  \nUsing the phosphorus uptake model, interim CR values for 32P and 33P were estimated as a \nfunction of bioavailable stable P in the river water. These CR values are presented in Figure \n4. Predicted CR values for a stable P concentration of 0.49 mg l-1 are shown as a vertical \ndashed line and presented in Table 3. Using the River Cam as an example, the model predicts \ninterim CR values (Trophic Level 3; muscle tissue) of 1500 l kg-1 for 32P and 2200 l kg-1 for \n33P at an average water temperature of 17oC. These estimates are more than one order of \nmagnitude lower than the recommended value of ca. 50,000 l kg-1 (IAEA, 1994, 2010) for \nfish \u201cedible portions\u201d.  \n \n3.2. Model comparison with available empirical data \n \nField data of radioactive phosphorus bioaccumulation are relatively sparse. Measurements \nwere, however, made in both the Soviet Union and the U.S.A. from discharges of radioactive \nphosphorus created as an activation product in the cooling water of certain nuclear reactors. \nThese data provide limited testing of the model. \nAnnual geometric mean CR values measured in whitefish in the Colombia River (Kahn and \nTurgeon, 1984) ranged between 3,000 and 300 l kg-1 though individual values at this site and \n- 14 - \n \nat other sites ranged between 100 and 12,000 l kg-1. It is not known, however, whether the \nvariation in values was influenced by relatively rapidly changing 32P activity concentrations \nin water which can make CR estimates inaccurate. Kahn and Turgeon (Kahn and Turgeon, \n1984) recommended an average CR for stable P of approximately 70,000 l kg-1 but noted that \nthis would vary according to stable P availability in the water. They suggested that the 32P \nconcentration factor would be approximately one-twentieth of this value (3,500 l kg-1), noting \nthat \u201cmeasured 32P bio-accumulation factors are of this magnitude, but vary considerably\u201d. A \nfurther experimental study of phosphorus uptake in fish, Kahn et al. (1987) observed that \u201cat \na mean [stable] phosphorus bioaccumulation factor of 70,000 [l kg-1, fish muscle] the factors \nfor 32P are 6,000 [bluegill] and 12,000 [catfish] respectively\u201d \nDuring operation of the Krasnoyarsk Mining and Chemical Industrial Complex (KMCIC), in \nRussia, significant quantities of 32P were discharged to the Yenisei River. Table 4 presents \nmeasurements of 32P in water and fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus) of the Yenisei River and an \nestimate of the mean CR. The Yenisei River is relatively low in stable P (though having large \nseasonal variations) leading to high bioaccumulation. A review by (Vakulovsky et al., 2004) \nhas estimated the water-fish CR of stable P in the Yenisei River to be in the range 104 \u2013 105 l \nkg-1, one- to two orders of magnitude greater than that measured for radioactive 32P (Table 4). \n \nThe available field data, therefore, strongly support a significantly lower CR for radioactive \nphosphorus than that derived for stable phosphorus. However, tentative quantitative \ncomparisons with these data suggest that the model may still significantly over-estimate \nuptake of radioactive phosphorus to fish in some aquatic systems. The stable P concentration \nin the Yenisei river varies seasonally between 0.01 \u2013 0.5 mg l-1 (A.I. Kryshev, pers \ncommun.). From Figure 4, the model predicts a CR of 32P for this system in the region 4 \u00d7 \n103 \u2013 2 \u00d7 105 l kg-1 (whole fish) significantly higher than that estimated from measurements \n(1.2 \u00d7 103 l kg-1, see Table 4). For the Colombia River, Kahn and Turgeon (1984) give a \nrange in stable P in water of 0.01 \u2013 0.05 mg l-1 which, from Figure 4, would give CR values \nin the range 1 \u00d7 104 \u2013 7 \u00d7 104 l kg-1 for 32P (fish muscle). Again this is significantly higher \nthan the range in reported values (1 \u00d7 103 \u2013 1 \u00d7 104 l kg-1) (Kahn and Turgeon, 1984). These  \nover-estimates may be due to the conservative assumptions inherent in the model, in \nparticular, the rate of uptake of stable and radioactive phosphorus through the food chain may \nhave been over-estimated. However, without more precise empirical data on both radioactive \n- 15 - \n \nand stable phosphorus in the Yenisei and Colombia Rivers, it is difficult to draw a strong \nconclusion on this issue.    \n \n3.3. Phosphorus accumulation pathway \n \nThere is good evidence that the primary uptake pathway for P in fish is via food rather than \ndirect uptake from water. Poston and Knopfler (Poston and Klopfer, 1986) state that \u201cthere \nwas a strong indication from laboratory experiments that accumulation of 32P from food was \nmore significant than adsorption from the water column\u201d. Kahn and Turgeon (Kahn and \nTurgeon, 1984) estimated a stable P intake via the food pathway which was approximately \n40,000 times higher than that via the water pathway. They observed a CR value of \napproximately 1 via the water pathway. A later experimental study (Kahn et al., 1987) found \nthat phosphorus uptake was two orders of magnitude lower via the water pathway compared \nto the food pathway. Laboratory experiments measuring the assimilation of 32P in brown trout \nalso showed relatively little uptake direct from the water, in comparison with the food uptake \npathway (Winpenny et al., 1998).  \n \n3.4. Radio-phosphorus accumulation in farmed fish \n \nAs discussed above, it seems clear that the accumulation of phosphorus occurs predominantly \nvia food and that the water pathway is of minor importance. This implies that farmed fish, \nreceiving a diet comprised of (presumably uncontaminated) fish pellets, would accumulate \nmuch less radioactive phosphorus than wild fish. Kahn and Turgeon (Kahn and Turgeon, \n1984) suggest a CR via the water pathway of approximately 1.0 l kg-1, several orders of \nmagnitude lower than that via the food pathway. Here, we do not give a recommended CR for \nfarmed fish as further research would be necessary before a recommendation could be made. \nSpecifically, an assessment of food sources of farmed fish would need to be made to confirm \nthat no significant proportion of wild food is ingested by farmed fish (many fish farms are in, \nor linked to, natural rivers or lakes).  \n \nIn spite of these caveats, it can be concluded that accumulation factors for radioactive \nphosphorus in farmed fish are likely to be significantly lower than those for wild fish. \n \n- 16 - \n \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nThe model presented here has been used to estimate the CR value for radioactive phosphorus \nas a function of available stable P in the water body. In lowland rivers in England and Wales, \nand, likely, in many rivers worldwide, this results in significantly lower estimated CR values \nthan the IAEA (1994, 2010) recommended values. For example, in the River Cam, the \npredicted CR value for radioactive phosphorus is approximately 5 \u00d7 103 l kg-1 (whole fish) or  \n2 \u00d7 103 l kg-1 (muscle tissue). \n \nThe current recommended CR of 32P and 33P of ca. 5 \u00d7 104 l kg-1 (IAEA, 1994, 2010) for fish \n\u201cedible portions\u201d (assumed to be primarily muscle tissue) is likely to be a significant over-\nestimate for many rivers. This is primarily a result of a conservative assumption inherent in \nthis recommended value: that the stable phosphorus concentration of the aquatic system is \nrelatively low. This is accounted for somewhat in the IAEA (1994) report since a large range \nin the recommended value is given: 3 \u00d7 103 - 1 \u00d7 105 l kg-1. The range in values in IAEA \n(2010) (ca. 4 \u2013 6 \u00d7 104 l kg-1, corrected for 32P decay) is, however, much too narrow.  \n \nThe relative importance of food-chain uptake and direct uptake from water has been assessed \nin a literature review. It can be concluded that food-chain uptake is the dominant \naccumulation pathway in fish and hence accumulation factors for radioactive phosphorus in \nfarmed fish are likely to be significantly lower than those for wild fish. Some further research \nis recommended to estimate suitable conservative CR values for farmed fish.  \n \n4.4. Scope and use of the model \n \nIt should be noted that, owing to the sparsity of field data on bioaccumulation of radioactive \nphosphorus in aquatic systems, the model could only be tested in a somewhat limited way. \nComparisons with the available empirical data from the Yenisei and Colombia rivers support \nthe general conclusion of a significantly lower CR for radioactive compared to stable \nphosphorus. The limited quantitative model test we have made here suggests the possibility \nthat the model still over-estimates CR for radioactive phosphorus in fish. More field studies \n- 17 - \n \nof the bioaccumulation of radioactive phosphorus in fish would improve confidence in the \nmodel outputs. \n \nOnce fully validated, the model presented here can be used to assess bioaccumulation of 32P \nand 33P in fish in any river. The inputs required are the estimated or measured activity \nconcentration in water, plus the concentration of bioavailable stable P in the water. It is \nimportant that an appropriate measure of bioavailable P be used (either \u201cdissolved\u201d P or \n\u201csoluble reactive\u201d P, SRP).  \n \n5.
