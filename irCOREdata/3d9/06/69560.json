Both developmental forms of Leishmania donovani life cycle were \ntested and three 6-bromo substituted indirubins (e.g. 5-Me-6-BIO, 6-BIO and 6-BIA) \nwere found to be more potent inhibitors of L. donovani promastigotes but interestingly \nalso of intracellular amastigotes. Experimental evidence provided here strongly supports \nthat the L. donovani LdGSK-3beta homolog is the main intracellular target of 5-Me-6-\nBIO and suggests a potential role of GSK-3beta in cell cycle progression and in \napoptotic-like death. The data also indicate that 6-BIO targets less efficiently LdGSK-\n3beta but binds with much higher affinity to the Leishmania CRK3 kinase inducing also \nG2\/M arrest and apoptosis-like death. Removal of the inhibitor or overexpression of \nLdGSK-3beta, but not of a kinase dead mutant, by Leishmania completely reverts the \ninhibitory cellular effects induced by 5-Me-6-BIO but only a partial reversion was seen \nwith 6-BIO treatment, further supporting the targeting specificity of 5-Me-6-BIO for \nLdGSK-3beta. Although, the validity of GSK-3 as a potential drug target has been \nrecently evaluated in T. brucei and few indirubin compounds have been used previously \nto target cyclin-dependent kinases in L. mexicana, this study extends beyond these \nprevious investigations by evaluating more indirubin compounds on different cell-cycle \nforms of L. donovani and by providing sufficient insight on the cellular targets and their \nbinding specificity as well as on their potential biological function. The conclusions here \nare well supported by a large set of experiments and the work is interesting and generally \nwell conducted.\nMore efforts toward the development of novel antileishmanial drugs should generally be \ndevoted, and this study is relevant and in line with such initiatives.\nSpecific remarks:\n1- Although the effect of 5-Me-6-BIO on LdGSK-3beta is clearly specific and implies \nthat the LdGSK-3beta is the main target of 5-Me-6-BIO, it is surprising however, that \nonly a 2-fold increase in the expression of LdGSK-3beta kinase in the Leishmania \noverexpressor was able to revert completely the inhibitory cellular effects (e.g. of growth \ninhibition, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis-like death) induced by 5-Me-6-BIO. Is \nthat possible that the HA-tagged version of GSK-3beta has a higher affinity for 5-Me-6-\nBIO than the WT enzyme or that may be this tagged protein undergoes a different \nphosphorylation or autophosphorylation pattern resulting in changes of its binding \naffinity to the inhibitors? Determining the inhibition (IC50) of this tagged protein kinase \n* Response to Reviewers\nactivity by 5-Me-6-BIO will probably answers part of this question. The authors should \ndiscuss this interesting but intriguing result. \nMay be it was not clearly stated but as described in the Material and Methods as well as \nin the Results Sections kinase assays were performed with the (His)6-tagged LdGSK-3s \npurified from LdGSK-3s over-expressing transfectants. Therefore the calculated IC50\nis that of the His-tagged LdGSK-3s (0.09 \u03bcM). We cannot measure the IC50 of the wild \ntype kinase since we have not purified the wild type kinase. However, the finding that \nwild type promastigotes as well as sat-transfectants after 72h of treatment were \ninhibited by 5-Me-6-BIO with an IC50 of 1.2\u00b10.2 \u03bc\u039c and 1.2\u00b10.1 \u03bcM respectively \nwhile the respective IC50 for the LdGSK-3s over-expressing transfectants, where there \nis a 2-fold increase in LdGSK-3s, was  approximately 2-fold higher IC50  2.8\u00b10.2 \u03bcM\n(Fig. 5\u0391,B) suggest that the wild-type kinase should be inhibited by 5-Me-6-BIO with \nan IC50 value comparable with that of the His-tagged LdGSK-3s. We have commented \non this in the Discussion Section, as suggested by the reviewer (lines 688-689).\n2- Given that LdGSK-3beta expression and subcellular localization are different between \nL. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes, it is somewhat surprising that the IC50, \nespecially for 5-Me-6-BIO, is the same for promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. \nCould the authors comment on that?\nWe believe that the fact that the IC50 values against 5-Me-6-BIO are approximately \nthe same between the two stages may be explained by  a higher activity of the kinase in \namastigotes stage than in  promastigotes which may be associated with the different pH \nand temperature conditions. Also we cannot exclude that 5-Me-6-BIO may also target\nother kinase in this stage.\nWe have included a comment on this in the Discussion section (lines 656-658)\n3- There are two GSK-3 isoforms (alpha and beta) in L. donovani. The authors have only \ninvestigated the LdGSK-3beta isoform. Did overexpression studies done with the GSK-\n3alpha isoform revert also the phenotype induced by 5-Me-6-BIO? It will be important to \nassess in future studies whether the GSK3-alpha isoform is also inhibited by the selected \nindirubin compounds to further validate GSK-3 as a potential drug target. \nPlease note that we have renamed the studied homologue from GSK-3\u03b2 to GSK-3 short\n(see reply to comment 1, reviewer 2).\nWe have studied only the LdGSK-3short isoform, because it is almost identical in\ndifferent Leishmania species and is closer to both  the mammalian GSK-3 isoforms. \nIndeed future studies focusing on GSK3 long isoform and its inhibition by the selected \nindirubin compounds will  further validate GSK-3 as a potential drug target. \n4- The manuscript is overall well written but is too long and needs to be reduced \nsignificantly in length. For example, reorganizing the different subsections and merging \nsome of them should shorten the Materials and methods section. The Results section \nneeds also to be shortened, especially the last section 3.8. It will also be preferable to \nintegrate the 6-BIO data (section 3.7) together with the 5-Me-6-BIO data, as most of the \nobserved phenotype with either inhibitor is quite similar. This will also save some space.\nFollowing the suggestions of the reviewer we have merged in the Materials and \nmethods 2.4 (Analysis of indirubin-treated promastigotes by flow cytometry) with 2.6 \n(Double staining with Annexin V and PI) and 2.13 (Expression of Leishmania Histone \nH1) with 2.14 (Kinase assays). This has shortened this section.\nWe also have integrated section 3.7 of the initial submission (G2\/M phase arrest and \ninduction of apoptosis-like death in 6-BIO-treated L. donovani promastigotes: LdGSK-\n3s over-expression counteracts 6-BIO induced cellular effects) with sections 3.5 and \n3.6 . Thus the new sections 3.5 and 3.6 are shorter.\nWe also have shortened section 3.8 (Structure Activity Relationships studies of \nindirubin-leishmanial kinases interactions using molecular simulations) that is 3.7 in \nthe revised manuscript. Some data on 3.7 are provided as supplementary.\n5- 6-BIO has a much higher binding affinity (IC50=0.005uM) for the human GSK-3beta \nthan for the Leishmania enzyme (IC50=0.15uM) but it has a stronger affinity for the \nLeishmania CRK3 (IC50=0.02 uM). On the other hand, 5-Me-6-BIO has a high affinity \n(IC50=0.09uM) for the LdGSK-3beta but there is no mention on its binding affinity for \nthe human ortholog.\nThe data generated from the molecular docking experiments in section 3.8 should be \nbetter discussed in the context of the binding affinities of these inhibitors to the \nLeishmania kinase targets vs. the corresponding human targets and what it could be done \nto improve or to reverse some of these binding affinities in order to increase parasite \nkilling while reducing toxicity to human cells. \nWe have included this omission concerning the activity of 5-Me-6-BIO for its human \northolog (lines 577-580). Also possible ways for the improvement of the affinities of \nindirubins towards parasite kinases have been incorporated in the Results (3.7 last \nparagraph lines 619-625) as suggested by the reviewer.\nMinor points:\n6- Figure 1 might be included as a supplemental material.\nFigure 1 is provided as supplemental material, as suggested by the reviewer.\n7- The Alamar blue assay, although it constitutes an improvement over other staining\nassays is not very quantitative for measuring intramacrophage Leishmania growth. \nTherefore, more quantitative assays that make use of reporter genes should eventually be\nused in the future to better evaluate the activity of indirubin compounds on intracellular\namastigotes in vivo. \nWe discuss the disadvantages of Alamar blue assay for measuring the growth of \nintracellular amastigotes compared to the use of reporter genes in the Discussion \nsection of the revised manuscript (line 634-637).\n8-This reviewer would like to stress the attention on the possibility that some of the\nindirubin compounds targeting specifically GSK-3 might have an effect on the host\nimmune responses against the parasite, hence altering parasite growth inside\nmacrophages (see the paper by Ohtani M, et al., Blood 2008). \nWe would like to note that in the context of this study we have not used activated \nmacrophages and therefore LPS-induced phosporylation of GSK-3 which in turn \nregulates IL-12 production is not applicable.  However, since this is an important issue \nwe have briefly stated in the Discussion of the revised manuscript that indirubins \n(GSK-3 inhibitors) may affect host immune responses (lines 724-726)\nReviewer #2:\nThis paper describes the effects of indirubin derivatives on Leishmania. The compounds\ncauses cell cycle defects and apoptosis-like cell death. Based on the fact that this family\nof compounds target GSK3 in mammalian cells, the authors focus subsequent work on\none of the GSK3-like enzymes, LdGSK3beta (the reasons given to select one rather than\nthe other -\"most well-studied mammalian isoform\" and \"almost identical in different\nLeishmania species\"- are not compelling). The central finding is that over-expression of \nLdGSK3beta renders parasite more resistant to the inhibitor, suggesting the enzyme is a \nmajor target.\nThe topic is clearly of interest. My main concern with the paper is its length: lack of \nconcision causes a dilution of the central points. The text should be shortened \nsignificantly (several sections, e.g. the data on the Paullones, might be included as \nsupplementary information), so as to present the main findings in a more incisive way. \nWe have shortened the revised manuscript by ~ 20% and data on additional \nstructurally divergent inhibitors (e.g. Paullones) has been provided as supplemental.\nThere are also additional issues that should be addressed before the manuscript becomes \nsuitable for publication.\nMajor points :\n1. Phylogeny of the Leishmania GSK3 enzymes. The authors rather summarily say (line \n406) that LGSK3a and GSK3b are \"equivalent\" to mammalian GSK3a and GSK3b. What \ndoes this mean? A simple phylogenetic tree of alpha and beta orthologues from several \nspecies is required to support the statement. The two GSK3-like proteins were identified \nin the Parsons et al., study of the kinome of trypanosmatids, which should be cited here \n(Comparative analysis of the kinomes of three pathogenic trypanosomatids: Leishmania \nmajor, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi. Parsons M, Worthey EA, Ward PN, \nMottram JC. BMC Genomics. 2005 Sep 15;6:127).\nThe phylogenetic tree of alpha and beta orthologues from several species is provided \nfor the reviewer but it is not included in the submitted revised version. For generating \nthe tree GSK-3 protein sequences from different species were aligned and for the \nanalysis PHYLIP package was used. For tree construction, we used either the \nneighbor-joining (NJ) method with at least 100 bootstrap samples, or the heuristic \napproximation of the maximum likelihood (ML) method which produced trees with the \nsame topology. The Leishmania GSK-3 forms group with the T. brucei and T. cruzi \nhomologues and are close to the S. cerevisiae GSK-3\u03b2 proteins. Oddly both the \nLeishmania GSK-3 forms seem to have the same distance from the mammalian GSK-3 \nforms. This could be explained by the fact that Leishmania GSK-3 long is \ncharacterized by several long amino-acid stretches which do not correspond to\nsequences from GSK-3 molecules from the other species and force the alignment \nalgorithms to introduce a lot of gaps. The gaps in the multiple alignments are ignored \nby the tree construction algorithms, thus producing a tree in which the differences \nbetween the two Leishmania GSK-3 forms are not well represented. \nUsing pairwise global alignments the resulting identity\/similarity matrix (Table 2 of the \nrevised manuscript) shows a higher identity (%) of the Leishmania GSK-3 short  than \nthe GSK-3 long form to both the human GSK-3 forms although GSK-3s has a slightly \nhigher identity to GSK-3\u03b2 than to GSK-3\u03b1 (Table 2).This does not allow us to \nunambiguously determine whether GSK-3s is equivalent to the GSK-3\u03b2 mammalian \nform.  Therefore we have renamed the studied homologue from GSK-3\u03b2 to GSK-3 \nshort.\nPlease refer to the Introduction and Results sections (lines 107-108 and lines 340-345\nrespectively). The annotation in the database has also been modified accordingly (Ac \nnumber EF620873).\nAlso, we have cited the suggested relevant publication (line 340).\n2. Km values. Line 327-330 : < Km values for ATP and substrate for each kinase were \nmeasured; In order to determine IC50 values, we used ATP and substrates concentrations \nat the calculated Km values\". Two questions\/comments: (1) the enzymological raw data \n(e.g. Lineweaver-Burke plots) should be made available (e.g. as Supplementary \nInformation). (2) From the statement above, it follows that both kinases have the same \nKm for ATP. Is that correct? That would be quite a coincidence!\nAs suggested by the reviewer Lineweaver-Burke plots are included in the revised \nmanuscript as supplementary information (figure 3).\nThe Km values for ATP for both kinases are around 15 \u03bcM, specifically LdGSK3s and \nCRK3 Km for ATP was 15.2 \u03bcM and 14.78 \u03bcM respectively. So, we used 15 \u03bcM for the \nkinase assays, in order to be able to compare the IC50 values with the inhibitors. \nWe refer to this in the Materials and Methods section 2.12. (lines 282-285).\n3. Effect of the inhibitors on amastigotes. Line 381 ff. If I understand the assay correctly, \nthe infected macrophages are treated for 72h with the inhibitor, lysed, and the viability of \nparasites is measured 48 hours after lysis. If this is indeed the case, then the amastigotes \nare under drastically non-physiological conditions for 48 hours prior to measurement of \nviability. Can it be excluded that the function assigned to GSK3 in intracellular survival \nis in fact a function in stress response (i.e. parasites require GSK3 activity to survive \nstress caused by the sudden change to axenic conditions?). In other systems, GSK3 \nhomologues are known to be involved in stress response (see for example Richard O, \nPaquet N, Haudecoeur E, Charrier B. \"Organization and expression of the GSK3\/shaggy \nkinase gene family in the moss Physcomitrella patens suggest early gene multiplication in \nland plants and an ancestral response to osmotic stress\", J Mol Evol. 2005 Jul;61(1):99-\n113. Koh S, Lee SC, Kim MK, Koh JH, Lee S, An G, Choe S, Kim SR.T-DNA tagged \nknockout mutation of rice OsGSK1, an orthologue of Arabidopsis BIN2, with enhanced \ntolerance to various abiotic stresses. Plant Mol Biol. 2007Nov;65(4):453-66.) This would \ndeserve a comment in the Discussion.\nThe reviewer\u2019s comment is correct. It could be speculated that in the intracellular \namastigotes the function of LdGSK-3 may be linked among others to their response \nand adaptation to stress (acidic pH and shift in temperature). This is mentioned in the \nDiscussion lines 653-655.\n4. Figure 3. the text and legend to Fig. 3 do not provide sufficient information: \n-There is no information on quality of the purified enzyme, other than the sentence (line \n460) \"we have purified LdGSK3 and CRK3 from L. donovani over-expressing \ntransfectants and transgenic Lm promastigotes, respectively\". One would really like to \nsee a gel of the purified proteins, to be able to evaluate purity, especially considering the \nfact that the authors propose specific activity measurements (lines 465-466). To know \nhow much kinase was used, one has to go to the Material & Methods section; even so, it \nis not clear what the source of enzyme is, as production from both bacteria and transgenic \nparasites is described. Please clarify.\n-There is no mention of the concentration of 5-Me-6-BIO used in lane 3.\n-Also, which casein was used (alpha, beta?) \n-Finally, in Fig 3 the negative control is a heat-denatured extract; the kinase-dead enzyme \nwould be a much better and more specific control. It is said (line 573) that \"LdGSK-\n3<beta>\/K49R, which was a kinase-dead mutant as confirmed by kinase assays\".. why \nnot include this in Fig. 3?\nThe requested information and relevant clarifications have been incorporated in the \nrevised version. \n- In particular we clearly mention that the LdGSK3s enzyme  used for the kinase assays \nin Fig. 2 was purified from L. donovani LdGSK3s over-expressing transfectants (1 \u03bcg \nLdGSK-3s\/reaction) (section 3.4, lines 417-418). We also mention this in the legend to \nFig.2.\n- A gel of the purified LdGSK3s and CRK3 is provided as supplementary figure 2 as \nsuggested.\n- In the material and methods section 2.12 (lines 273-274 and 290-291), we report that \nthe source of the enzyme in both cases was from transgenic parasites. \n-The concentration of 5-Me-6-BIO used in lane 3 was 4 \u03bc\u039c, in order to achieve \nmaximum inhibition of the enzyme (section 3.4, line 424). We also mention this in the\nlegend to Fig.2.\n- Concerning the type of casein we used it was dephosphorylated from bovine milk and \nwas obtained from Sigma (C4032). It is usually used as a substrate for protein kinase \nassays (section 2.12, line 293).\n-The reviewer\u2019s comment was correct. So, we have repeated the experiment and used \nthe kinase-dead mutant LdGSK-3s\/K49R as a negative control (new Fig. 2, lane 4)\n5. Effect of over-expression of a kinase-dead mutant. One would expect that this would \nlead to a dominant-negative effect. In Fig. 7, there is no panel showing the sat-\nLdGSK3betaK49R in the absence of any inhibitor (the \"control\" line show presumably \nwild-type parasites?). It would be interesting to see if overexpression of the mutant itself \ncauses some phenotype. \nThe expression of the kinase-dead mutant did not lead to an apparent phenotype, as the \ncells still express the native kinase (Fig 5A). In Fig 6 (previously Fig 7) we do not show \nthe sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R in the absence of any inhibitor, as they have the same \nphenotype with sat and sat-LdGSK-3s promastigotes. No apparent changes in parasite \ngrowth, cell cycle progression or morphology were observed. Fig. 5C shows that the \ncell cycle of the parasites expressing LdGSK-3s\/K49R in the absence of the inhibitor is \nnormal. We mention this in lines 552-553. In Fig. 6 control cells (sat, sat-LdGSK-3s or \nsat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R) treated with 0.02% DMSO had a normal morphology. We \nmention this in lines 552-554.\n6. Structural modelling. The identification of the gatekeeper as a potential cause for \ndifference in IC50s is interesting. One suggestion: since the authors rightly point out (line \n683) in the context of GSK3 that apo structures are not as suitable as holo structures for \ndocking experiments, it is important that that state that the structure (1E9H) they used in \nthe context of CRK3 modelling is not just that of \"CDK2\" as they mention, but that of the \nCDK2-cyclinA complex, and hence much closer to an active configuration; it would be \nbest to cite the original paper (Davies et al., Structure, 2001).\nWe have cited the original paper (Davies et al., Structure, 2001), concerning the \nCDK2-cyclinA complex, which was used to build the CRK3 homology model as \nsuggested.\nMinor and editorial points:\nSeveral sentences are misconstructed and should be rewritten. Examples:\nLine 416: \"GSK-3<beta> homologues are almost identical in different Leishmania \nspecies and is the most well-studied mammalian isoform including crystallographical \ndata.\"\nLine 347 was rewritten: \u201cGSK-3s homologues are almost identical in different \nLeishmania species and b) GSK-3s is slightly closer to the mammalian GSK-3<beta, \nthe most well-studied  isoform.\nLine 467: \"After determining the Km values for ATP and the respective for the \nsubstrates,.\"\nLine 398 was rewritten: \"After determining the Km values of both kinases for ATP and \ntheir respective substrates.\"\nLine 672: \"Moreover indirubin analogs, while potently inhibit leishmanial GSK-3<beta> \n(6BIO IC50=0.150<mu>M), they are not as efficient as in the case of the human \nhomolog (6-BIO IC50=0.005<mu>M).\"\nLine 578 was rewritten: \"While indirubin analogs potently inhibit leishmanial GSK-3s\n(5-Me-6-BIO IC50=0.09\u03bcM, 6BIO IC50=0.150\u03bcM), they are not as efficient as in the \ncase of the human homolog (5-Me-6-BIO IC50=0.006\u03bcM, 6-BIO IC50=0.005\u03bcM) \n(Meijer et al., 2003; Polychronopoulos et al., 2004).\nPlease give references for the TDZD-8 and SNS-032 inhibitors (line 494)\nWe give the references for all the inhibitors that we used in the kinase assays in the \nsupplementary material under the name \u201cStructurally divergent inhibitors\u201d.\nFor the benefit of the non-specialist reader, explain what a hypodiploid Leishmania cell \nis.\nWe have explained in the text that a hypodiploid Leishmania cell is a cell with <2N \nDNA content (line 447).\nFor reviewing purposes1\n\u201c5-Me-6-BIO targeting the leishmanial GSK-3 short form affects cell-cycle 2\nprogression and induces apoptosis-like death: exploitation of GSK-3 for treating 3\nleishmaniasis\u201d4\n5\nEvangelia  Xingi a , Despina Smirlis a, Vassilios Myrianthopoulos b, Prokopios Magiatis b, Karen M. 6\nGrant c, Laurent Meijer d, Emmanuel Mikros b, Alexios-Leandros Skaltsounis b  and Ketty  7\nSoteriadou a8\n9\na Laboratory of Molecular Parasitology, Department of Microbiology, Hellenic Pasteur Institute, 10\n127 Vas.

Since the 6-33\nBr substitution on the indirubin backbone greatly enhances the selectivity for mammalian GSK-3 34\nover CDKs, we identified the leishmanial GSK-3 homologues, a short (LdGSK-3s) and a long one, 35\nfocusing on LdGSK-3s which is closer to human GSK-3\u03b2 for further studies. Kinase assays showed 36\nthat 5-Me-6-BIO inhibited LdGSK-3s more potently than CRK3 (the CDK1 homologue in 37\nLeishmania), while 6-BIO was more selective for CRK3. Promastigotes treated with 5-Me-6-BIO 38\naccumulated in the S and G2\/M cell-cycle phases and underwent apoptosis-like death. 39\nInterestingly, these phenotypes were completely reversed in parasites over-expressing LdGSK-3s. 40\nThis finding strongly supports that LdGSK-3s is a) the intracellular target of 5-Me-6-BIO and b) 41\ninvolved in cell-cycle control and in pathways leading to apoptosis-like death. 6-BIO treatment 42\ninduced a G2\/M arrest, consistent with inhibition of CRK3, and apoptosis-like death. These effects43\nwere partially reversed in parasites over-expressing LdGSK-3s suggesting that in vivo 6-BIO may 44\nalso target LdGSK-3s. Molecular docking of 5-Me-6-BIO in CRK3 and 6-BIO in human GSK-3\u03b245\nand LdGSK-3s active sites predict the existence of functional\/structural differences that are 46\nsufficient to explain the observed difference in their affinity. In conclusion, LdGSK-3s is validated 47\nas a potential drug target in Leishmania and could be exploited for the development of selective 48\nindirubin-based leishmanicidals. 49\n50\nKeywords: L. donovani glycogen synthase kinase-3 short; 5-Me-6-BIO; 6-BIO; indirubins;51\napoptosis-like death; drug target52\n53\n31. Introduction54\nLeishmaniasis is an umbrella term for a group of protozoan vector-borne parasitic diseases and 55\nmanifests with three major forms, visceral, cutaneous and mucocutaneous. It is a significant cause 56\nof morbidity and mortality in developing countries, and affects about 2 million people per year 57\nmostly in tropical and subtropical regions (Alvar et al., 2006). Leishmaniasis is also an important 58\npublic health and veterinary concern in Mediterranean countries (Dujardin, 2006). Chemotherapy 59\nfor leishmaniasis is generally ineffective mainly due to the emerging drug-resistance and severe 60\ntoxic side effects (Croft et al., 2006). Antimonials are used as first-line treatment despite their 61\ntoxicity. In case of antimonial resistance, liposomal formulations of amphotericin B, not devoid of 62\nadverse side effects, are used (Croft et al., 2006). Miltefosine, the first oral drug, has proved to be 63\nhighly effective against visceral leishmaniasis. However, miltefosine-resistant parasites have been 64\nobtained in vitro indicating that there is a risk of resistance emerging in the field. Consequently 65\nthere is an urgent need to discover new targeted drugs against leishmaniases (Croft et al., 2006).66\nLeishmania species are transmitted to mammals by the bite of a sand fly vector. During a sandfly67\nblood meal, Leishmania promastigotes pass into the mammalian host where they penetrate  68\nmacrophages and, within their phagolysosomes, transform into the non-flagellated, non-motile 69\namastigote form  and multiply (Chang, 1983). These trypanosomatid protozoan parasites have 70\ndeveloped unusual and unique features in their cell biology to ensure adaptation to the contrasting 71\nenvironments of their insect and mammalian hosts that are reflected in the complexity of their cell-72\ncycle control and during their differentiation. Therefore, differences between cell-cycle control in 73\nLeishmania and mammals may lead to the identification of essential molecules regulating the 74\nparasite cell-cycle that could  be exploited for rational drug design (Naula et al., 2005). Potential 75\nparasite candidate targets include cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), glycogen synthase kinases 76\n(GSK-3), Aurora kinases and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Naula et al., 2005).77\nRecently, it was shown that T. brucei GSK-3 \u201cshort\u201d is a potential drug target for trypanosomiasis 78\ntherapy (Ojo et al., 2008). Efforts are therefore focused on the exploitation of kinase inhibitor79\n4libraries for the identification and further development of inhibitors that selectively target parasite 80\nkinases without damaging the host. 81\nIndirubin analogues (collectively referred to as indirubins), a family of bis-indoles known for 82\nover a century as a minor constituent of plant, animal and microorganism-derived indigo, are83\npowerful inhibitors of mammalian CDKs and GSK-3 by competing with ATP for binding to their84\ncatalytic site (Meijer et al., 2003; Polychronopoulos et al., 2004). 6-bromo substituted indirubins 85\ndisplay higher selectivity for mammalian GSK-3 over CDKs (Meijer et al., 2003; Polychronopoulos 86\net al., 2004). In cell-based assays, indirubins display anti-mitotic and anti-tumoral activity  and 87\ninduce arrest in G1 or G2\/M phase of the cell-cycle, depending on the cell line (Hoessel et al., 1999; 88\nDamiens et al., 2001). Specifically, 6-bromo-indirubin-3\u2019-oxime (6-BIO) induces apoptotic death in 89\nneuroblastoma cells (Ribas et al., 2006).90\nGSK-3 is a multifunctional serine\/threonine kinase found in all eukaryotes. This enzyme is 91\nknown to play a key role in many cellular and physiological events, including Wnt signaling, 92\ntranscription, cell-cycle and differentiation, neuronal functions and circadian rhythm (Frame et al., 93\n2001; Doble and Woodgett, 2003). These functions of GSK-3 and its implication in many human 94\ndiseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and cancer have 95\nstimulated an active search for potent and selective GSK-3 inhibitors, like indirubins (Meijer et al., 96\n2004).  97\nCRK3, a leishmanial CDK1 homologue, displaying 54% identity and 71% similarity with 98\nhuman CDK1, has been validated as a drug target (Grant et al., 1998; Hassan et al., 2001). Three 99\nindirubins (5-sulfonamide-indirubin-3\u2019oxime, 5-SO3Na-3\u2019oxime and 5-SO3H) have been shown to 100\ninhibit CRK3 with IC50 values of 11 nM, 16 nM and 47 nM respectively and L. donovani infection 101\nof mouse macrophages with IC50 values of 3.56 \u03bcM , 5.8 \u03bcM and 7.6 \u03bcM respectively (Grant et al., 102\n2004; Wells et al., 2006). L. mexicana promastigotes treated with indirubins displayed growth arrest 103\nand disruption of cell-cycle, in line with the inhibition of a CDK (Grant et al., 2004). 104\n5In this study, sixteen indirubins were tested for their antileishmanial activity and three, 6-BIO, 6-105\nBIA and 5-Me-6-BIO, were found to be the most powerful inhibitors of both L. donovani106\npromastigotes and intracellular amastigotes growth. Since the 6-Br substitution on the indirubin 107\nbackbone greatly enhances the selectivity for mammalian GSK-3 over CDKs, we identified the 108\nleishmanial GSK-3 homologues, a short (LdGSK-3s) and a long one (LdGSK-3l). We then 109\ninvestigated whether our compounds target LdGSK-3s which is closer to human GSK-3\u03b2. LdGSK-110\n3s was identified as the predominant intracellular target of 5-Me-6-BIO. Evidence is also presented 111\nthat LdGSK-3s is involved in cell-cycle control as well as in pathways leading to apoptosis-like 112\ndeath.113\n114\n115\n2. Materials and methods116\n117\n2.1. Cell culture118\nL. donovani (strain LG13, MHOM\/ET\/0000\/HUSSEN) promastigotes and the murine 119\nmacrophage J774 cell line (ATCC) were cultured in medium 199 (M199) and RPMI 1640 (RPMI) 120\nrespectively, both supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS), 10 mM 121\nHepes and antibiotics. Axenic L. donovani amastigotes were generated as previously described122\n(Barak et al., 2005; Smirlis et al., 2006). Spleen-derived L. donovani amastigotes were maintained 123\nin Schneider\u2019s insect medium pH 5.5 supplemented with 20% HI-FBS at 370C. L. donovani124\ntransfectants with pLEXSY-sat, pLEXSY-sat-LdGSK-3s, and pLEXSY-sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R were 125\ncultured in M199 supplemented with 100 \u03bcg\/ml nourseothricin (Jena Bioscience). L. mexicana126\nCRK3his transfectants were cultured as described previously (Grant et al., 2004). 127\n128\n2.2. Chemical library129\n6The library consists of sixteen indirubins (Table 1), synthesized as previously described,130\n(Polychronopoulos et al., 2004; Ribas et al., 2006). The compounds were dissolved in DMSO at 10 131\nmM and serial dilutions in DMSO were made (1 mM and 100 \u03bc\u039c). Indirubins were diluted in132\nculture medium to give the desired final concentrations. 133\n134\n2.3. Testing in vitro the antileishmanial activity of indirubins against L. donovani promastigotes, 135\nintracellular amastigotes and axenic amastigotes. 136\nThe Alamar blue assay (Mikus and Steverding, 2000) was applied for determining the 137\nantileishmanial activity of indirubins  and Amphotericin B (Fungizone) was used as a reference 138\ndrug. Stationary-phase L. donovani promastigotes (2\u00d7107 cells\/ml) were seeded into 96-well flat 139\nbottom plates at a density of 2.5\u00d7106 cells\/ml in 200 \u03bcl M199 without phenol red, containing 140\nincreasing indirubin concentrations or the equivalent volume of the diluent DMSO, each in 141\nquadruplicate. The final concentration of DMSO was always <1% (v\/v) and did not affect the 142\ngrowth of parasites. Following indirubin treatment for 72 h, Alamar blue (20 \u03bcl\/well) was added 143\nand the plates were incubated at 260C for a further 12 h. Colorimetric readings were performed at a 144\ntest wavelength of 550 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Comparison of DMSO-treated 145\ncontrols with samples allowed the calculation of the concentration of indirubin necessary to reduce 146\nthe growth rate of promastigotes by 50% (IC50 values).147\nTo evaluate the inhibitory activity of indirubins on intracellular amastigotes we treated infected 148\nmacrophages for 72 h with indirubins and then assessed amastigote survival by lysing infected 149\nmacrophages using the Alamar blue assay. Briefly, J774 macrophages (2\u00d7105 cells\/ml in 200 \u03bcl 150\nRPMI) were left to adhere overnight at 370C in 5% CO2 into 96-well flat bottom plates.151\nMacrophages were infected with stationary-phase L. donovani promastigotes at a ratio of 10 152\nparasites\/macrophage and incubated for a further 24 h at 370C in 5% CO2 as previously described153\n(Papageorgiou and Soteriadou, 2002). Then the overlying medium was removed and cells were 154\nwashed three times in fresh RPMI. Fresh RPMI was added containing increasing concentrations of 155\n7indirubins or the equivalent volume of the diluent DMSO, each in quadruplicate. After 72 h, the 156\nmedium was removed and infected cells were lysed by addition of 100 \u03bcl 0.01% SDS in PBS for 30 157\nmin at 370C. Then 100 \u03bcl Schneider\u2019s medium was added to each well, that contained the liberated 158\namastigotes (Papageorgiou and Soteriadou, 2002). Amastigote growth was assessed by the addition 159\nof Alamar blue (20 \u03bcl\/well) and the plates were incubated for 48 h at 370C. Comparison of DMSO-160\ntreated controls with samples enabled the calculation of the degree to which infection had been 161\ninhibited by the presence of indirubins and to calculate the concentration that reduces the number of 162\namastigotes by 50%.163\nL. donovani axenic amastigotes  were treated with the inhibitors and the percentages of growth 164\ninhibition were assessed by addition of Alamar blue after 72 h of treatment (Habtemariam, 2003). 165\nIn all cases, IC50 values were determined from dose-response curves via linear interpolation.166\n167\n2.4. Analysis of indirubin-treated promastigotes by flow cytometry (FACS).168\nStationary-phase (2\u00d7107 cells\/ml) L. donovani promastigotes were seeded at 106 cells\/ml in 169\nM199 and incubated at 260C in the presence of DMSO (the diluent, used as control) or the tested 170\nindirubin. Preparation of samples for FACS analysis of the cell-cycle was carried out as described 171\nby Smirlis et al. (Smirlis et al., 2006). Exposed phosphatidylserine on the outer membrane of cells 172\nand plasma membrane integrity of cells were assessed using Annexin V-FITC and PI staining 173\n(Apoptosis Detection kit, R&D Systems). Preparation of samples for FACS analysis was performed 174\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In all cases, twenty thousand cells\/sample were 175\nanalyzed, using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer and data were analyzed using the 176\nCell Quest software. All experiments were performed at least three times.  177\n178\n2.5. Cellular and nuclear morphology. 179\nStationary-phase L. donovani promastigotes were seeded at 106 cells\/ml and incubated with 180\neither 2 \u03bcM indirubin or DMSO for 24 and 48h.  Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and181\n8treated with 50 \u03bcg\/ml RNaseA and 10 \u03bcg\/ml propidium iodide (PI). Parasites were observed under a 182\nTCSSP Leica Confocal fluorescence microscope. At least 100 cells from three independent 183\nexperiments were recorded for each condition.184\n185\n2.6. Cell count and viability assay186\nStationary-phase L. donovani promastigotes were seeded at 106 cells\/ml and incubated with 187\neither 2 \u03bcM 5-Me-6-BIO or DMSO for 24, 48h and 72 h.  Cells were then washed twice in PBS, 188\nresuspended in drug-free medium and allowed to recover for 24h, 48 h and 72 h. The viability assay 189\nat different time points after exposure of parasites to 5-Me-6-BIO and drug removal was assessed 190\nusing 0.4% Trypan blue solution. Both total cell count and the percentages of viable and non viable 191\ncells were recorded. The experiment was performed three times. 192\n193\n2.7. In situ labeling of DNA fragments by TUNEL.194\nIn situ detection of DNA strand breaks was performed using the Cell Death Fluorescein 195\nDetection kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Samples were 196\nanalyzed under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope at 120\u00d7 magnification. The ratio of apoptosis197\n(apoptotic to total cells) was determined by counting at least 400 cells per group in three 198\nindependent experiments.199\n200\n2.8. Gene cloning and antibody production. 201\nThe L. donovani GSK-3s gene was amplified by PCR from L. donovani (strain LG13, 202\nMHOM\/ET\/0000\/HUSSEN) genomic DNA, using a sense primer 5\u2019-ACC GCC ATG GAC ATG 203\nTCG CTC AAC GCT GC-3\u2019 and an antisense primer 5\u2019-CCC CCT CGA GCT GCT TGC GAA 204\nCTA GCT T-3\u2019, that were designed based on the gene coding for the shorter of the two L. major 205\nFriedlin GSK-3 proteins (LmjF18.0270). The amplified PCR product was cloned into the NcoI-206\nXhoI site of pTriEx-1.1 vector (Novagen), a construct allowing the addition of a poly-Histidine 207\n9extention to the C-terminus of the recombinant protein (pTriEx-1.1-LdGSK-3s). The cloned gene 208\nwas then sequenced and compared with the short sequence of L. infantum GSK-3209\n(LinJ18_V3.0270). The LdGSK-3s DNA and protein sequences were found to be identical to the L. 210\ninfantum GSK-3s sequences. LdGSK-3s nucleotide sequence was deposited in GenBank 211\n(EF620873). The pTriEx-1.1-LdGSK-3s construct was transformed into bacteria and (His)6\u2013tagged212\nLdGSK-3 was purified by Metal-Affinity Chromatography (Qiagen Ni-NTA Superflow resin). 213\nLdGSK-3s was detected using a polyclonal IgG His-probe antibody (1:500 dilution, stock solution 214\n200 \u03bcg\/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a polyclonal anti-ratGSK-3\u03b2 antibody. The recombinant 215\nprotein  was subsequently used to immunize a New Zealand white rabbit using the scheme 216\ndescribed in a previous study (Smirlis et al., 2006). Affinity purified anti-LdGSK-3s antibody was 217\nisolated by low pH elution of antibodies bound to purified LdGSK-3s on nitrocellulose strips, as 218\npreviously described (Smirlis et al., 2006).219\n220\n2.9. Generation of transgenic promastigotes and purification of LdGSK-3s and CRK3.221\nThe DNA encoding (His)6\u2013tagged LdGSK-3s was amplified by PCR from the construct pTriEx-222\n1.1-LdGSK-3s, described above. Sense and antisense primers for the amplification were 5\u2019-ACC 223\nGCC ATG GAC ATG TCG CTC AAC GCT GC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019 GCA GGC GGC CGC TGA GGT 224\nTAA TCA CTT AGT G 3\u2019 respectively. The PCR product was then cloned in the NcoI and NotI225\nsites of the Leishmania expression vector pLEXSY-sat (pF4X1.4sat) (Jena Bioscience) to generate 226\nthe pLEXSY-sat-LdGSK-3s plasmid. The cloned gene was sequenced to confirm the correct 227\norientation. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on LdGSK-3s in pLEXSY-sat-LdGSK-3s228\nconstruct, using the Phusion\u00ae Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Finnzymes) following the 229\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol. Primers used for Lysine 49 to Arginine mutation (K49R) were as follows: 230\nForward 5\u2019-GAGCGTGGCGATCCGGAAGGTTATCCAGGAC-3\u2019 and Reverse 5\u2019-231\nATGCCCGTCGACTTCTCCTTGCCTAGTTGCA-3\u2019. The K49R mutation in the construct232\npLEXSY-sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R was confirmed by sequencing.  233\n10\nL. donovani transfectants with pLEXSY-sat, pLEXSY-sat-LdGSK-3s and pLEXSY-sat-LdGSK-234\n3s\/K49R plasmids (supercoiled, transfected as episomes) were generated as previously described 235\n(Smirlis et al., 2006). Selection of transgenic promastigotes was performed in M199 containing 100 236\n\u03bcg\/ml nourseothricin.237\nPurification of LdGSK-3s from L. donovani sat-LdGSK-3s transfectants and of LdGSK-3s\/K49R 238\nfrom sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R transfectants as well as of CRK3 from transgenic L. mexicana  239\npromastigotes was carried out as previously described (Grant et al., 2004). LdGSK-3s and CRK3 240\nwere stored with 10% glycerol at -800C for kinase assays.241\n242\n2.10. Immunoblotting243\nParasites were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM MOPs pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 244\nmM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors 245\n(0.1mg\/ml leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 5 \u03bcg\/ml aprotinin, 5 \u03bcg\/ml pepstatin A, 1 mM phenanthroline) 246\nand Laemmli sample buffer was added. Whole cell lysates were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE,247\ntransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and subsequently probed with the appropriate primary 248\nantibodies: a polyclonal anti-ratGSK-3\u03b2 antibody [directed against the C-terminal sequence 249\nCAHSFFDELRDPNVK, residues identical between rat and LdGSK-3s are underlined] (1:100 250\ndilution, stock solution 500 \u03bcg\/ml, Abcam); the generated anti-LdGSK-3s rabbit polyclonal 251\nantibody (1:1000 dilution) and the polyclonal IgG His-probe antibody (1:200 dilution). After 252\nincubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, 3,3\u2032-Diaminobenzidine was used for 253\ndetection.254\nTo demonstrate equal loading of cells, the blot was stripped and re-probed with antiserum 255\nagainst L. infantum myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (LinJ14_V3.1450, INO1), reported to be 256\nequally expressed in L. mexicana promastigotes and amastigotes (Ilg, 2002). The INO1 gene was 257\nPCR-amplified from L. infantum genomic DNA, using a sense primer 5\u2019-258\nCAAGGGATCCGATGACGCGTGACATGGACG-3\u2019 and an antisense primer 5\u2019-GGCACTC 259\n11\nGAGCAGCATGTTGCTGTCGG-3\u2019, cloned into the BamHI and XhoI site of pTriEx-1.1, in frame 260\nwith a C terminal his-tag, expressed in E. coli and purified on Ni-NTA resin. Anti-Lin INO1261\nantibody was produced and purified, using nitrocellulose strips with purified INO1, as previously 262\ndescribed (Smirlis et al., 2006).263\n264\n2.11. Immunofluorescence265\nParasites were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde. Cells were blocked in 50 266\nmM NH4Cl containing 3% BSA in PBS and treated with 50 \u03bcg\/ml RNaseA. Nuclei were stained 267\nwith 10 \u03bcg\/ml PI followed by incubation for 5 h with either anti-LdGSK-3s or the anti-ratGSK-3\u03b2 268\nantibodies (10 \u03bcg\/ml or 5 \u03bcg\/ml respectively) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA. 269\nThe bound antibody was detected with 1:100 diluted FITC conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-rat IgG 270\nantibody (Sigma). Cells were observed with a TCSSP Leica Confocal fluorescence microscope. 271\n272\n2.12. Kinase assays273\nKinase assays were performed with purified LdGSK-3s and CRK3 from L. donovani over-274\nexpressing transfectants and transgenic L. mexicana promastigotes respectively (supplementary Fig.275\n2). The kinase activity of LdGSK-3s was assayed using GS-1 peptide 276\n(YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQSpEDEEE) as a substrate; GS-1  peptide was patterned after the 277\nGSK-3 phosphorylation sites of mammalian glycogen synthase (Meijer et al., 2004). CRK3 kinase 278\nassays were performed using histone H1 substrate as previously described (Grant et al., 2004). All 279\nassays were performed in the kinase assay buffer (50 mM MOPS pH 7.2, 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 280\nEGTA, 2 mM DTT) in the presence of [\u03b3-33] ATP (3,000 Ci\/mmol; 1 mCi\/ml) in a final volume of 281\n30 \u03bcl and incubated for 30 min at 300C as previously described (Meijer et al., 2004). Initially the 282\nKm values for ATP and substrate for each kinase were measured. The Km values for ATP for both 283\nkinases were around 15 \u03bcM (15.2 \u03bcM for LdGSK3s  and 14.78 \u03bcM for CRK3). In order to 284\ndetermine the IC50 values with the inhibitors, we used ATP and substrate concentrations at the 285\n12\ncalculated Km values. For both LdGSK-3s and CRK3 15 \u03bc\u039c ATP were used in the assays, in the 286\npresence of 8.3 \u03bc\u039c GS-1 peptide and 5 \u03bc\u039c histone H1 respectively. Ki values for each inhibitor 287\nwere calculated using the Cheng-Pursoff equation [Ki= IC50\/ (1+ S\/Km)]. Kinase assays were also 288\nperformed using the Kinase Luminescent Assay Kit (Promega), following the manufacturer\u2019s 289\ninstructions, and gave comparable results.290\nLdGSK-3s activity (purified from L. donovani over-expressing transfectants, 1 \u03bcg 291\nenzyme\/reaction) was also determined using potential protein substrates: L. infantum histone H1 292\n(LeishH1), mammalian histone H1 (Sigma), axin (recombinant, purified from bacteria), myelin 293\nbasic protein and casein (dephosphorylated from bovine milk, Sigma), (approximately 1 \u03bcg 294\nsubstrate\/reaction). LeishH1 was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with Glutathione-S-295\nTransferase (GST) and purified with Sepharose 4B-Glutathione beads as previously described 296\n(Smirlis et al., 2006). LeishH1 recombinant protein was cleaved from the GST moiety by thrombin 297\ntreatment (Smirlis et al., 2006). In vitro phosphorylation of protein substrates was performed in the298\nkinase assay buffer.  After 30-min incubation at 300C, in the presence of [\u03b3-32P] ATP (6,000 299\nCi\/mmol, 10 mCi\/ml) in a final volume of 30 \u03bcl, the kinase reaction was stopped by addition of 300\nLaemmli buffer (Meijer et al., 2004). The protein substrates were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, 301\nstained with Coomassie blue and their phosphorylation level was visualized by autoradiography. 302\n303\n2.13. Homology modeling304\nThe homology model of parasite GSK-3s was based on the crystal structure of the human 305\nGSK-3\u03b2 complexed with 6-BIO (pdb 1Q41) and the respective of CRK3 on the template structure 306\nof human CDK2-cyclin A (pdb 1E9H), (Davies et al., 2001). Model building was performed with 307\nMODELLER v. 6 program (Sali and Blundell, 1993) and stereochemical validation with 308\nPROCHECK program (Laskowski, 1991). Docking was performed with a Monte Carlo search 309\nalgorithm. Ligand partial charges were calculated in a semi-empirical level by MOPAC6 (AM1 310\nhamiltonian) (Stewart, 1990).311\n13\n3. Results312\n313\n3.1. Evaluation of the antileishmanial effect of indirubins towards L. donovani promastigotes and314\namastigotes. 315\nThe Alamar blue assay (Mikus and Steverding, 2000) in a 96-well format, was used for the 316\nprimary screening and subsequent monitoring of the growth of L. donovani promastigotes and 317\naxenic amastigotes exposed to indirubins. The same assay was adapted and used for estimating the 318\ngrowth of intracellular amastigotes 48 h after lysis of the infected macrophages treated for 72 h with 319\nthe indirubins. In the initial screening, sixteen indirubins were tested at 10 \u03bcM. Nine of the 320\ncompounds did not significantly affect parasite growth even when used at a higher concentration of 321\n50 \u03bcM. Four out of the sixteen compounds tested significantly inhibited Leishmania growth and 322\ntheir IC50 values were determined, (Table 1). More specifically, 6-BIO, 6-BIA and 5-Me-6-BIO323\ninhibited promastigote growth with an IC50 of 0.8\u00b10.1 \u03bcM, 0.9\u00b10.1 \u03bcM and 1.2\u00b10.2 \u03bcM 324\nrespectively (Table 1). 5-BIO inhibited promastigote growth with an IC50 of 5.2\u00b11.6 \u03bcM (Table 1). 325\nInterestingly, 6-BIO, 6-BIA, 5-Me-6-BIO and 5-BIO were also found to significantly inhibit the 326\ngrowth of both L. donovani intracellular and axenic amastigotes with IC50 values ranging from327\n0.75\u00b10.05 \u03bcM to 1\u00b10.2 \u03bcM respectively (Table 1). N1-methyl derivatives of 6-BIO and 6-BIA did 328\nnot inhibit the growth of either promastigotes or amastigotes, consistent with the inactivation of 329\nindirubins as kinase inhibitors by this modification (Meijer et al., 2003).330\nAll four compounds did not affect the growth of macrophages at the concentration used, but as 331\ndetermined using the same assay, they were toxic for host cells at significantly higher 332\nconcentrations (IC50 values >25 \u03bcM). Amphotericin B used as a reference drug inhibited 333\npromastigote and amastigote (intracellular or axenic) growth with IC50 values of 0.1\u00b10.01 \u03bcM and 334\n0.2\u00b10.02 \u03bcM respectively. 335\n336\n337\n14\n3.2. Molecular characterization of LdGSK-3s: expression and localization in L. donovani life cycle.338\nSince 6-bromo indirubins are powerful and selective  inhibitors of mammalian GSK-3 (Meijer et 339\nal., 2003; Polychronopoulos et al., 2004) we searched in the Leishmania GeneDB database for 340\nGSK-3 homologues (Parsons et al., 2005). Two GSK-3 encoding genes were found in the 341\nLeishmania genome by BLAST homology searches, a short and a long version. Comparison of the 342\namino acid identities of the two human GSK-3 orthologues versus the two L. infantum forms 343\nrevealed that GSK-3s is closer than GSK-3l to human GSK-3\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2. However, GSK-3s has 344\na slightly higher identity to GSK-3\u03b2 than to GSK-3\u03b1 (Table 2). This does not allow us to 345\nunambiguously determine whether GSK-3s is equivalent to the GSK-3\u03b2 mammalian form.346\nWe focused on the GSK-3s isoform for further studies, since: a) the GSK-3s homologues are347\nalmost identical in different Leishmania species and b) GSK-3s is slightly closer to the mammalian 348\nGSK-3\u03b2, the most well-studied isoform. The GSK-3s gene in L. infantum, in L. major and in L. 349\nmexicana is located on chromosome 18 and encodes a protein of 355 amino acids with a predicted 350\nmolecular mass of 40.7 kDa. BLASTP analysis showed that the identified L. donovani GSK-3s351\ngene was identical to the L. infantum GSK-3 short gene and almost identical to L. major and L. 352\nmexicana GSK-3 short and GSK-3\u03b2 genes respectively (98% identity and 99% similarity), 353\n(supplementary Fig. 1). LdGSK-3s shares 49% sequence identity and 68% similarity with hGSK-354\n3\u03b2. It also shares 65% identity and 80% similarity with T. brucei GSK-3 \u201cshort\u201d, 47% identity and 355\n67% similarity with Danio rerio GSK-3\u03b2, 42% identity and 64% similarity with Plasmodium 356\nfalciparum GSK-3, and 49% identity and 68% similarity with Mus musculus GSK-3\u03b2 357\n(supplementary Fig. 1).358\n      LdGSK-3s was detected in L. donovani extracts using an affinity-purified anti-LdGSK-3s359\npolyclonal antibody (raised against the recombinant protein expressed in E.coli) and a commercially 360\navailable polyclonal anti-ratGSK-3\u03b2 antibody (raised against the C-terminal sequence of rat GSK-361\n3\u03b2). The ~40 kDa protein detected by both antibodies is in line with the predicted molecular mass of 362\nLdGSK-3s. Western blot analysis indicated that the level of expression of LdGSK-3s in L. donovani363\n15\nstationary and logarithmic-phase promastigotes (107 cells\/lane) was comparable (Fig. 1A, lanes S 364\nand L respectively). LdGSK-3s was also detected in spleen-derived L. donovani amastigotes and 365\naxenic amastigotes (107 cells\/lane), (Fig. 1A, lanes Am and Ax respectively). Scanning 366\ndensitometry of the detected bands revealed that LdGSK-3s expression level was about 3-fold lower 367\nin amastigotes. As a control for loading equal number of cells, the blot was stripped and re-probed 368\nwith the antiserum against L. infantum myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (LinINO1), a 46 kDa 369\nprotein whose level of expression is constitutive during promastigote growth and which is equally 370\nexpressed in promastigotes and amastigotes, (Ilg, 2002; Rosenzweig et al., 2008) (Fig. 1B). No 371\nprotein band was detected when pre-immune serum was used, as a negative control, (Fig. 2C, lane 372\nS, Ax). LdGSK-3s was also recognized by the anti-ratGSK-3\u03b2 antibody (Fig. 2D lane S). Similarly, 373\nthe mouse GSK-3\u03b2 (a 47 kDa protein) in J774 cell extracts (9\u00d7105 cells\/lane) was detected using 374\nboth antibodies (Fig. 1A and D, lane J774). This result shows the cross reactivity of the two 375\nantibodies with mammalian and leishmanial GSK-3s. 376\nThe intracellular localization of LdGSK-3s in L. donovani promastigotes and axenic amastigotes 377\nwas detected by immunofluorescence using both the affinity-purified anti-LdGSK-3s and the anti-378\nratGSK-3\u03b2 antibodies. Immunostaining of L. donovani logarithmic-phase promastigotes showed 379\nthat LdGSK-3s is localized in the parasite cytoplasm and flagellum (Fig. 1E). FITC-staining in the 380\nparasite nucleus or kinetoplast was detected at background levels. Interestingly, LdGSK-3s was 381\nlocalized mainly in the parasite nucleus and flagella in stationary-phase promastigotes (Fig. 1E).382\nLdGSK-3s was also detected in logarithmic-phase axenic amastigotes but the pattern of 383\nimmunostaining was different from both logarithmic- and stationary-phase promastigotes:  more 384\ncondensed and localized immunostaining in the cytoplasm of axenic amastigotes (Fig. 1E). In all 385\ncases staining with the two antibodies was similar and therefore only that with the affinity-purified386\nanti-LdGSK-3s is shown.387\n388\n3.3. LdGSK-3 s and CRK3 inhibitor screen.389\n16\nSince 6-bromo indirubins are powerful inhibitors of mammalian CDKs and GSK-3 (Meijer et al., 390\n2003; Polychronopoulos et al., 2004) we thought to examine whether they also target LdGSK-3s391\nand\/or CRK3. To this end we have purified LdGSK-3s and CRK3 from L. donovani over-392\nexpressing transfectants and transgenic L. mexicana promastigotes respectively (supplementary Fig. 393\n2) and their kinase activities were assayed using GS-1 peptide and histone H1 as substrates 394\nrespectively, in the presence of the indirubins that displayed maximum growth inhibition in the cell-395\nbased assay.  Of note is that L. donovani CRK3 displays 99% sequence identity with L. mexicana 396\nCRK3, which was used for the inhibitor screen. Specific activities of the enzymes were found to be 397\n800 U\/mg for LdGSK-3s and 750 U\/mg for CRK3. After determining the Km values of both 398\nkinases for ATP and their respective substrates, (supplementary Fig. 3), dose-response curves were 399\nused to calculate the IC50 values (Table 3). 6-BIO, 6-BIA, 5-BIO and 5-Me-6-BIO inhibited 400\nLdGSK-3s with IC50 values of 0.15, 0.17, 0.35 and 0.09 \u03bcM respectively, whereas CRK3 was 401\ninhibited with IC50 values of 0.02, 0.25, 0.7 and 0.65 \u03bcM respectively (Table 3). Thus, 5-Me-6-BIO 402\ndisplayed an approximately 7-fold selectivity for LdGSK-3s over CRK3, while 6-BIO was about 7-403\nfold more active towards CRK3 than LdGSK-3s. 6-BIA inhibited CRK3 ~1.5-fold more than 404\nLdGSK-3s. N1-methyl derivatives of 6-BIO and 6-BIA, that displayed no growth inhibition in the 405\ncell-based assay, were inactive on both kinases (Table 3).406\nTo compare the inhibitory activity of indirubins against LdGSK-3s and CRK3, IC50 values were 407\nevaluated relatively to Ki values of the inhibitors which were equal to \u00bd of IC50 values because 408\nkinase assays were performed in ATP concentration equal to the Km for ATP. 5-Me-6-\u0392\u0399\u039f409\ninhibited LdGSK-3s with a Ki of 0.045 \u03bcM and CRK3 with a Ki of 0.325 \u03bcM . 6-\u0392\u0399\u039f inhibited410\nLdGSK-3s with a Ki of 0.075 \u03bcM and  CRK3 with a Ki of 0.01 \u03bcM. 411\nIndirubins 6-FIO, 6-ClIO and 6-IIO substituted at position 6 with the halogens F, Cl and I 412\nrespectively were found less active towards both kinases (Table 3) as well as towards L. donovani413\npromastigotes (IC50 values >3 \u03bcM). Interestingly, 6-iodo substituted indirubin was 5-fold more 414\nactive towards LdGSK-3s. 415\n17\n416\n3.4. Substrate selectivity of LdGSK-3s. 417\nSubstrate selectivity of LdGSK-3s purified from L. donovani over-expressing transfectants (1 \u03bcg 418\nLdGSK-3s\/reaction) was investigated using potential substrates: LeishH1, axin, myelin basic 419\nprotein (MBP), mammalian histone H1 and casein (Fig. 2). LeishH1 was chosen because it 420\npossesses the consensus recognition motif for phosphorylation by GSK-3\u03b2: S\/TXXXS\/T(P), where 421\nX is any amino-acid (Doble and Woodgett, 2003).  LdGSK-3s shows no autophosphorylation when 422\nthe kinase assay is performed without substrate (Fig. 2, lane 1). Phosphorylation of LeishH1 by 423\nLdGSK-3s (Fig 2, lane 2) was inhibited when the kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 424\n4 \u03bcM 5-Me-6-BIO, (Fig 2, lane 3). Control kinase reaction was also performed, using the kinase-425\ndead mutant LdGSK-3s\/K49R with LeishH1 as a substrate (Fig 2, lane 4). The GST moiety was not 426\nphosphorylated by LdGSK-3s (Fig 2, lane 5). Axin (~ 55 kDa), MBP (18.4 kDa), mammalian 427\nhistone H1 (21.5 kDa) and casein (23 kDa) were found to be good protein substrates of LdGSK-3s428\n(Fig 2, lanes 6-9). The basic nature of histones and the rich content in prolines in casein that affects 429\nits conformation cause them to migrate slower in SDS-PAGE. None of the substrates tested 430\ndisplayed intrinsic phosphorylation (data not shown). However, more experimental data is needed 431\nto prove in vivo interaction of LdGSK-3s and LeishH1, as the kinase phosphorylating LeishH1 has 432\nnot been identified so far.  433\n434\n3.5. Cell-cycle disruption and induction of apoptosis-like death in 5-Me-6-BIO- and 6-BIO- treated435\nL. donovani promastigotes.436\nThe cell-cycle distribution of promastigotes incubated with 5-Me-6-BIO and 6-BIO was 437\nanalyzed using flow cytometry (Fig. 3A). Promastigotes treated with 1 \u03bc\u039c 5-Me-6-BIO for either 438\n24 h or 48 h resulted in a decrease in the G0\/G1 DNA content (40.9% and 37.5% respectively439\ncompared to 66% of control parasites) and an increase in cells in S phase (13.4% and 11% 440\nrespectively compared to 7.3% of control cells) with a concomitant increase in the G2\/M phase of 441\n18\nthe cell-cycle (43.7% and 49.4% respectively compared to 23.9% of control cells). Treatment of442\npromastigotes with 6-BIO resulted in an increase in the proportion of cells with G2\/M DNA 443\ncontent, the latter being time and dose dependent. After 48 h of treatment with 2 \u03bcM 6-BIO 74.5% 444\nof cells were in G2\/M ((Fig 3B). Control cells treated with the diluent (0.01% or 0.02% DMSO) 445\nhad a normal cell-cycle distribution at all time-points studied (66% G0\/G1, 7.66% S, 23.8% G2\/M).446\nOf note is that cells treated with 2 \u03bc\u039c 5-Me-6-BIO for 24 h and 48 h had a high percentage of 447\nhypodiploid cells  (<2N DNA content) and  accumulated in the sub-G0 phase (29.8% and 40% 448\nrespectively) which is indicative of apoptotic-like cell death (Fig. 3A).449\nIn order to investigate whether 5-Me-6-BIO- and 6-BIO- induced apoptotic-like mechanisms in 450\nLeishmania we used double staining with Annexin V-FITC and PI. This staining allows the 451\ndifferentiation between early apoptotic (Annexin V-FITC positive), late apoptotic (Annexin V-452\nFITC and PI positive), necrotic (PI positive) and viable cells (unstained). Incubation of cells with 453\n0.02% DMSO showed negative staining for both Annexin V and PI, as 97.8% of cells were viable 454\nat all time-points (Fig. 3C, control). In the positive control for necrosis, 39.23% of Triton X-100-455\ntreated promastigotes were found to be PI positive (Fig. 3C, Triton X-100).  49.23%  of cells treated 456\nwith 4 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), used as a positive control for apoptosis, for 40 min (Das et 457\nal., 2001) were found to be late apoptotic, 2.97%  early apoptotic and 13.99% necrotic (Fig. 3C, 458\nH2O2). Treatment of promastigotes with 2 \u03bc\u039c 5-Me-6-BIO for 48 h resulted in a high percentage of 459\nAnnexin V positive cells (57.9%), of which 6.42% were early apoptotic and 51.48% were late 460\napoptotic, while viable cells were 38.42% (Fig. 3C, 5-Me-6-BIO). The percentage of cells 461\nundergoing early apoptosis was higher than that of late apoptosis (29.35% versus 12.03%) when 462\ncells were treated for 24 h whereas treatment of promastigotes with 2 \u03bc\u039c 5-Me-6-BIO for 72 h463\nresulted in an increase in PI positive cells, as 26.04% of cells were necrotic and 61.2% late 464\napoptotic, while only 10.83% of cells were viable (data not shown). Treatment of promastigotes 465\nwith 2 \u03bc\u039c 6-BIO for 48 h resulted in an increased labeling with Annexin V. Early and late 466\n19\napoptotic cells together constituted about 40.4% of the cells: 20.18% of cells were late apoptotic 467\nand 20.23% were early apoptotic compared to controls (Fig. 3C, 6-BIO).468\nTo further study whether the observed effect of indirubins was due to apoptosis-like death  we 469\nmonitored morphological and nuclear changes by confocal microscopy. Control cells displayed a 470\nnormal elongated morphology with two discrete stained organelles, the nucleus and the kinetoplast 471\n(Fig. 4, control). Promastigotes exposed to 5-Me-6-BIO for 24 h showed rounded forms, cell 472\nshrinkage and variations in the length of their flagella as well as nuclear changes characteristic of 473\napoptosis-like death; apoptotic nuclei were identified by their bright red fluorescence, which 474\nincluded a certain degree of condensation of nuclear chromatin in 36% of cells and breakdown of 475\nthe nuclear material in 41% of cells (Fig. 4, 5-Me-6-BIO, 24 h). At the 48 h-time point, 78% of cells 476\nexhibited a totally fragmented nucleus (Fig. 4, 5-Me-6-BIO, 48 h). Formation of zoids was not 477\nobserved (Grant et al., 2004). Treatment with 2 \u03bcM of 6-BIO for 24 h had less pronounced 478\nmorphological alterations. It resulted in cells with either a normal morphology with a discrete 479\nkinetoplast and a nucleus (approximately 38% of cells) or in rounded-shaped with short flagella and 480\ncondensed nuclear chromatin (~62%) (Fig. 4, 6-BIO, 24 h). After treatment with 6-BIO for 48 h, 481\nthe majority of parasites (75%) displayed an aberrant morphology, with round body shape and short 482\nflagella of which 36% displayed nuclear condensation and 39% nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 4, 6-483\nBIO, 48 h).484\nSince the cellular effects induced by 5-Me-6-BIO were more pronounced than those of 6-BIO we485\ninvestigated whether they were reversibile after drug removal. To this end the recovery of cells 486\nfollowing exposure to 5-Me-6-BIO for 24h, 48 h and 72 h was assessed 24h, 48 h and 72 h after the 487\ndrug removal. Control cells treated with 0.02% DMSO were viable at all time-points tested (100% 488\nviability). As shown in Fig. 3D treatment of cells with 5-Me-6-BIO for 24 h followed by incubation 489\nwith fresh medium up to 72 h resulted in full recovery of cells. After 48 h of treatment, about 48% 490\nof cells were viable. Further incubation in fresh medium for 24 h resulted in an increase in the 491\npercentage of viable cells (77.7%). At the 48 h and 72 h time-points, a full recovery of the cells was 492\n20\nobserved.  In contrast, incubation for 72 h with 5-Me-6-BIO resulted in about 89% dead cells. 493\nRemoval of the drug resulted in irreversible cytotoxicity. 494\n495\n3.6. LdGSK-3s over-expression in L. donovani counteracts 5-Me-6-BIO- and 6-BIO- induced 496\ngrowth inhibition, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis-like death497\nTo investigate whether LdGSK-3s is the intracellular target of 5-Me-6-BIO and whether all the 498\nobserved phenotypes in the presence of 5-Me-6-BIO could be attributed to inhibition of this kinase,499\nwe have generated transgenic L. donovani promastigotes over-expressing LdGSK-3s and compared 500\ntheir susceptibility to 5-Me-6-BIO with that of control transfectants bearing the plasmid alone. We 501\nalso investigated whether over-expression of LdGSK-3s affected the growth inhibitory effect of 6-502\nBIO. As a control, we generated transgenic promastigotes overexpressing LdGSK-3s\/K49R, which 503\nwas a kinase-dead mutant as confirmed by kinase assays (Fig. 2, lane 4). The mutation of the 504\ncatalytic residue Lys 49 to Arg was designed based on the homology model of LdGSK-3s and on 505\nthe widely used mutation of Lys 85 to Arg or Ala of mammalian GSK-3\u03b2, which results in a kinase-506\ndead protein (He et al., 1995). Over-expression of LdGSK-3s and expression of LdGSK-3s\/K49R507\nin the LdGSK-3s and LdGSK-3s\/K49R transfectants was confirmed by immunoblotting using both508\na His-probe antibody and the anti-LdGSK-3s antibody (Fig. 5A). The LinINO1 antibody was used 509\nas a loading control. Scanning densitometry showed that the level of expression of LdGSK-3s in 510\nLdGSK-3s and LdGSK-3s\/K49R transfectants was about 2-fold higher in comparison with sat511\ntransfectants (Fig. 5A). Expression of the kinase-dead mutant did not cause any apparent changes in 512\nparasite growth or morphology.513\nThe susceptibility of stationary-phase L. donovani sat, sat-LdGSK-3s and sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R514\ntransfectants to increasing concentrations of 5-Me-6-BIO was assessed after 24h, 48 h and 72 h of 515\ntreatment by cell counting. The IC50 of 5-Me-6-BIO after 24h, 48h and 72h of treatment of the sat-516\ntransfectants was 1.5\u00b10.2 \u03bcM, 1.25\u00b10.1 \u03bcM and 1.2\u00b10.1 \u03bcM respectively, which are comparable 517\nwith the IC50 against wild type promastigotes (Table 1), whereas its respective IC50 for the LdGSK-518\n21\n3s over-expressing transfectants was 3.6\u00b10.3 \u03bcM, 3.2\u00b10.2 \u03bcM  and  2.8\u00b10.2 \u03bcM (Fig. 5B). As 519\nexpected, the sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R transfectants were inhibited by 5-Me-6-BIO with IC50 values of 520\n1.7\u00b10.1 \u03bcM after 24 h, 1.4\u00b10.1 \u03bcM after 48 h and 1.3\u00b10.05 \u03bcM after 72 h, which are comparable 521\nwith the respective IC50 values against sat-transfectants (Fig. 5B).522\nTreatment of the LdGSK-3s over-expressing transfectants with 6-BIO resulted in a clear 523\ndecrease in their sensitivity, with IC50 values of 4.8\u00b10.5 \u03bcM after 24 h, 2.2\u00b10.4 \u03bcM after 48 h of 524\ntreatment and 1.57\u00b10.3 \u03bcM after 72 h of treatment, which were approximately 2-fold higher 525\ncompared to IC50 values of sat and sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R transfectants (Fig. 5D). Sat and sat-526\nLdGSK-3s\/K49R transfectants treated with different 6-BIO concentrations displayed growth 527\ninhibition with approximately the same IC50 values as L. donovani wild type promastigotes. Sat 528\ntransfectants were inhibited with IC50 values of 2.75\u00b10.45 \u03bcM after 24 h of treatment, 1.3\u00b10.3 \u03bcM 529\nafter 48 h of treatment and 0.78\u00b10.25 \u03bcM after 72 h of treatment and sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R 530\ntransfectants were inhibited with IC50 values of 2.9\u00b10.3 \u03bcM after 24 h, 1.3\u00b10.2 \u03bcM after 48 h and 531\n0.85\u00b10.2 \u03bcM after 72 h (Fig. 5D). 532\nFlow cytometry analysis of the DNA content of control L. donovani sat, sat-LdGSK-3s and sat-533\nLdGSK-3s\/K49R over-expressing transfectants, treated with 0.02% DMSO, showed that cells had a 534\nnormal cell-cycle distribution: 67.9% G1, 6.9% S, 23.2% G2 (Fig. 5C, control). Interestingly, sat-535\nLdGSK-3s promastigotes incubated with 2 \u03bc\u039c 5-Me-6-BIO for 48 h had a normal cell-cycle 536\ndistribution: 62% G1, 5.45% S and 30.5% G2 (Fig. 5C, 5-Me-6-BIO), whereas 40% of sat and sat-537\nLdGSK-3s\/K49R transfectants were hypodiploid  and  accumulated in the sub-G0 phase (Fig. 5C), 538\nas was observed with wild type promastigotes (Fig. 3A). 539\nHowever, as shown in Fig. 5C, LdGSK-3s over-expressing promastigotes treated with 6-BIO 540\ndisplayed a less pronounced increase in G2\/M (41.7% compared to 74.5% in 6-BIO-treated wild 541\ntype parasites) and a less pronounced decrease in G0\/G1 (46% compared to 15.8% in 6-BIO-treated 542\nwild type parasites) (Fig. 5C, sat-LdGSK-3s).  In contrast, sat transfectants incubated with 2 \u03bc\u039c 6-543\nBIO for 48 h were comparable with wild type promastigotes and arrested at G2\/M (74.9% 544\n22\ncompared to 23.2% of control), with a significant decrease in G0\/G1 (19.3% compared to 67.9% of 545\ncontrol) (Fig. 5C, 6-BIO). Similar results with the latter were obtained for the sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R 546\ntransfectants which had the following cell-cycle distribution: 21.8% G0\/G1, 4.4% S and 71.7% 547\nG2\/M. 548\nSince LdGSK-3s over-expression resulted in a significantly reduced growth inhibition and a 549\nnormal cell-cycle distribution upon 5-Me-6-BIO-treatment, we investigated whether LdGSK-3s550\nover-expression affected apoptosis-like death using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-551\nmediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, which detects apoptosis at a single-cell level. 552\nControl cells treated with 0.02% DMSO (sat, sat-LdGSK-3s or sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R) containing 553\nintact genomic DNA were not stained, (Fig. 6, control). Promastigotes treated with 4 mM H2O2 for 554\n6 h, served as a TUNEL positive control, as about 99% of cells showed positive nuclear staining 555\n(Fig. 6, H2O2). Sat transfectants exposed to 2 \u03bc\u039c 5-Me-6-BIO for 48 h were about 68% TUNEL 556\npositive and their morphology was dramatically affected in comparison to the normal elongated 557\nmorphology of control cells (Fig. 6, sat\/5-Me-6-BIO). Treated cells displayed an aberrant 558\nmorphology, with round body shape and cell shrinkage. Sat-LdGSK-3s transfectants treated with 2 559\n\u03bc\u039c 5-Me-6-BIO for 48 h were not positive for TUNEL reactivity, only a background staining of 560\nabout 3% was detected and their morphology was not affected (Fig. 6, sat-LdGSK-3s\/5-Me-6-BIO).561\nSat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R transfectants were about 70.4% TUNEL positive (Fig. 6, sat-LdGSK-562\n3s\/K49R\/5-Me-6-BIO).563\nThe contribution of LdGSK-3s in the apoptosis-like death observed in 6-BIO treated 564\npromastigotes was also studied using the over-expressor lines. Whereas sat transfectants exposed to 565\n2 \u03bc\u039c 6-BIO for 48 h were ~ 50% TUNEL positive and their morphology was dramatically affected, 566\nLdGSK-3s over-expressing transfectants were resistant to the effects of 6-BIO and displayed a 567\nmuch milder phenotype. Only 20% of the cells were TUNEL positive and their morphology was not 568\nsignificantly affected when compared to control cells (Fig. 6, sat\/6-BIO and sat-LdGSK-3s\/6-BIO 569\n23\nrespectively). As expected, sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R transfectants were about 52.9% TUNEL positive 570\n(Fig. 6, sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R\/6-BIO). 571\n572\n3.8. 3.7. Structure Activity Relationships studies of indirubin-leishmanial kinases interactions using 573\nmolecular simulations. 574\nBiological results imply that indirubins inhibit leishmanial kinases. Interestingly, the selectivity 575\nobserved for 6-substituted indirubins towards GSK-3 with respect to the CDKs in human is reversed 576\nin the case of Leishmania and the homologous kinases (GSK-3 and CRK3) with the exception of 577\nthe 6-iodo as well as the bisubstituted 5-Me-6Br analogs. While indirubins potently inhibit the 578\nleishmanial GSK-3s (5-Me-6-BIO with an IC50=0.09\u03bcM and 6BIO with an IC50=0.150\u03bcM), they 579\nare not as efficient as in the case of the human homolog (5-Me-6-BIO with an IC50=0.006\u03bcM and580\n6-BIO with an IC50=0.005\u03bcM) (Meijer et al., 2003; Polychronopoulos et al., 2004).581\nBoth pairs of homologous kinases are highly similar and the observed differences in affinity 582\ncould possibly be explained by the key residue differences of the binding cavity. In order to obtain  583\ninsight in the inhibitor-protein interactions, we built homology models of the parasite kinases584\n(supplementary data). Despite the fact that important residues of the leishmanial GSK-3s seem to be 585\nwell conserved (supplementary Fig. 1), there were two major differences between the two kinases 586\nlocated in the binding pocket: a) the replacement of Gln185hGSK-3\u03b2 by His155LGSK-3s in the sugar-587\nbinding region and b) the replacement of the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d Leu132hGSK-3\u03b2 by Met100LGSK-3s. The 588\n\u201cgatekeeper\u201d residue controls access to a hydrophobic cavity of the binding pocket and is 589\nconsidered as a selectivity determinant of most ATP competitive kinase inhibitors (Bohmer et al., 590\n2003). In the majority of the members of the GSK-3 family (CMGC III), the gatekeeper is a leucine, 591\nexcept for MCK-1 kinase which has a methionine (Hanks and Quinn, 1991). However, a 592\nmethionine is present in Leishmania, Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum GSK-3s, 593\n(supplementary Fig. 1).594\n24\nDocking calculations were performed in order to study the binding mode\/interactions of 595\nindirubins in the binding cavity of each kinase. In each case the inhibitor was anchored at the kinase 596\nbackbone through the formation of three hydrogen bonds in the usually observed adenine type of 597\ninteraction (Figure 7A), while the substituent of position 6 was positioned in the hydrophobic cavity 598\nformed by the sidechain of the gatekeeper residue interacting with it. In human GSK-3\u03b2 the leucine 599\ngatekeeper can form only hydrophobic interactions with the 6 substituent of indirubin. However, in 600\nthe parasite kinase the mode of interactions accommodated by the methionine gatekeeper is more 601\ncomplicated, resulting in a larger entropic and desolvation cost upon inhibitor binding 602\n(supplementary data). Such a net effect for the replacement of the leucine gatekeeper to a 603\nmethionine could be considered as unfavorable for binding affinity, accounting for the loss of 604\nbinding affinity in a common trend for all indirubins tested, which is in consistency with IC50605\nresults obtained from kinase assays. 606\nThe higher affinity for CRK3 (reversal of selectivity with respect to the human kinases) 607\ndemonstrated by 6-substituted indirubins tested with the exception of 6-IIO, 5-Me-6-BIO and 608\npartially of 6-BIA compared to the affinity for LdGSK-3s could be explained by the formation of a 609\nhydrogen bond between Tyr101CRK3 and Glu103CRK3 (Figure 7B), which is not possible in the 610\nhuman CDK2 homolog. The influence of this bonding interaction on the cavity size and 611\nsubsequently on the ligand affinity could explain the observed gain of selectivity of 6-BIO towards 612\nCRK3. The above holds with the exception of 6-IIO, the bisubstituted 5-Me-6-BIO and the 613\nacetoxime 6-BIA, for which energy optimization calculations demonstrated that the presence of the 614\nbulky substituent provoked a displacement of the ligand and the pair of residues Tyr101-Glu103 615\n(Figure 7C) resulting in less favorable interactions and loss of affinity.616\nAll aforementioned structural observations are in accordance with previous studies showing that617\nminor differences of the kinase binding cavity elements induce major variations in affinity and 618\nshould be taken into account in designing new selective inhibitors of the leishmanial GSK-3s and 619\nCRK3. One possible route of selectively improving affinity towards the parasite GSK-3 is by taking 620\n25\nadvantage of the differential presence of the proton accepting His155LGSK-3 (instead of Gln185hGSK-621\n3\u03b2 of human). The replacement or extension of the oxime by a group with the potential to form 622\nattractive albeit selective interactions with the sidechain of His155 LGSK-3 would increase affinity 623\ntowards the parasite protein. Combined with the obvious preference of LdGSK-3 for bisubstituted 624\nor generally bulkier substituents with regard to CRK3, a moderate selectivity improvement can be 625\nachieved, resulting in an increase of parasite killing while reducing toxicity to human cells.626\n627\n628\n4. Discussion629\nHerein we showed that three 6-bromo substituted indirubins, 6-BIO, 6-BIA and 5-Me-6-BIO630\nwere powerful inhibitors of both L. donovani promastigote and intracellular amastigote growth. L. 631\ndonovani axenic amastigotes were also inhibited by the three indirubins with IC50 values \u22641 \u03bcM, a 632\nfinding that further supports that indirubin-induced growth inhibition of intracellular amastigotes is 633\nmediated through parasite-kinase(s) inhibition and not through inhibition of the host-kinase(s). 634\nThe adapted Alamar blue assay allows the rapid and easy screening of the antileishmanial 635\nactivity of compounds in 96-well format, although it is not very quantitative for measuring636\nintramacrophage Leishmania growth when compared to luciferase-expressing recombinant parasites 637\n(Roy et al., 2000). Also it does not measure the number of amastigotes at the point of lysis. 638\nHowever, contrary to Giemsa staining it takes into account only viable cells.  639\nSince 6-bromo substitution on the indirubin backbone enhances the selectivity for mammalian 640\nGSK-3 over CDKs (Meijer et al., 2003) we investigated whether 6-BIO, 6-BIA and 5-Me-6-BIO641\ntarget GSK-3 in Leishmania and studied their selectivity over CRK3. To this end we identified and 642\ncharacterized one of the two GSK-3 forms in L. donovani, namely LdGSK-3s, and found that its643\nexpression pattern was comparable in logarithmic and stationary-phase promastigotes, but it was 644\nabout 3-fold down-regulated in amastigotes, consistent with recent findings on LdGSK-3s645\nexpression in L. donovani axenic amastigotes (Rosenzweig et al., 2008). In addition, LdGSK-3s646\n26\nwhich had cytosolic and flagellar localization in logarithmic-phase promastigotes, displayed nuclear 647\ntranslocation in stationary-phase promastigotes. In mammalian cells, GSK-3\u03b2 is also predominately 648\nin the cytosol although under proapoptotic stimuli, a portion of GSK-3\u03b2 is found within the nucleus649\n(Meares and Jope, 2007). LdGSK-3s translocation to the nucleus in stationary-phase promastigotes, 650\nthought to be arrested in G1 phase of the cell-cycle (Wiesgigl and Clos, 2001), may reflect a role for 651\nLdGSK-3s in G1, consistent with accumulation of parasites in G1 when LdGSK-3s is inhibited with 652\n5-Me-6-BIO.  The observed differences in the localization and expression level of LdGSK-3s may 653\nreflect divergent roles played by LdGSK-3s in the two parasite stages. It could be speculated that in 654\nthe intracellular amastigotes the function of LdGSK-3s may be linked among others to their 655\nresponse and adaptation to stress conditions i.e. pH and temperature changes (Richard et al., 2005).656\nThe finding that the level of inhibition of promastigotes and amastigotes by 5-Me-6-BIO is the 657\nsame although LdGSK-3s is 3-fold less in amastigotes may suggest that LdGSK-3s activity is 658\nhigher in the latter or that 5-Me-6-BIO may also target other kinases in this stage.659\n  Inhibitor screen assays against LdGSK-3s and CRK3 showed that 5-Me-6-BIO, which is a 50-660\nfold selective inhibitor of mammalian GSK-3 over CDK1\/Cyclin B (Meijer et al., 2003; 661\nPolychronopoulos et al., 2004) displayed an approximately 7-fold selectivity for LdGSK-3s over 662\nCRK3. However, 6-BIO was about 7-fold more active towards CRK3 than LdGSK-3s, although it is 663\na mammalian GSK-3 selective inhibitor, with 64-fold less potency towards CDK1\/Cyclin B664\n(Meijer et al., 2003). Molecular docking of the compounds in hGSK-3 and CDK1 active sites as 665\ncompared to  LdGSK-3s and CRK3 support the higher inhibitory activity of 5-Me-6-BIO towards 666\nLdGSK-3s compared to CRK3 and the lower inhibitory activity of 6-BIO towards LdGSK-3s667\ncompared to that against its mammalian counterpart.668\n5-Me-6-BIO and 6-\u0392\u0399\u039f displayed a disparity between cellular activity and enzyme activity (Ki 669\nvalues) (22-27 fold for 5-Me-6-BIO and 75-80 fold for 6-BIO), which can be attributed to: a) the670\nATP concentration in the kinase assays, that is several fold lower than the intracellular 671\nconcentration, which is in the mM range, b) the bioavailability of the inhibitors (cell permeability of 672\n27\nthe compounds, rate of inhibitor efflux  by cell efflux pumps), c) possible in vivo phosphatase 673\nactivity, d) the intracellular concentration of the target kinase, e) the presence of the LdGSK-3l674\nisoform and f) need for total inhibition of the enzyme to get cellular effect (Knight and Shokat, 675\n2005).676\nWe next investigated the effects on cell-cycle progression and the death process induced by 5-677\nMe-6-BIO treatment, using a number of different techniques. Its effect on parasite growth appeared678\nto be more dose- than time-dependent, as the IC50 values did not significantly vary with the 679\nincubation time. However, 5-Me-6-BIO treatment affected the recovery potential of treated cells 680\nafter removal of the drug, as cells were able to recover after 48 h of treatment, whereas 72 h of 681\ntreatment caused an irreversible inhibition of cell growth .682\nIn an effort to elucidate whether 5-Me-6-BIO targets LdGSK-3s in vivo and the potential role of 683\nLdGSK-3s in cell-cycle progression and apoptosis-like death a sat-LdGSK-3s over-expressor 684\nmutant and a cell line expressing a kinase-dead mutant sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R were generated. Cells 685\nthat over-express LdGSK-3s (about 2-fold) were about 2-fold less susceptible to growth inhibition 686\nthan sat-LdGSK-3s\/K49R and sat transfectants at all time-points, indicating that the observed687\ngrowth inhibition was closely associated with inhibition of LdGSK-3s activity by 5-Me-6-BIO. In 688\naddition these results imply that the wild-type kinase should be inhibited by 5-Me-6-BIO with an 689\nIC50 value comparable with that of the His-tagged LdGSK-3s. Also, the 2-fold increase in LdGSK-690\n3s expression in sat-LdGSK-3s transfectants completely reversed the cell-cycle disruption effect of 691\n5-Me-6-BIO and abolished the induction of apoptosis-like death. However, the LdGSK-3s\/K49R 692\nexpression resulted in similar phenotypes with those of the sat transfectants. The results provide 693\nstrong evidence that LdGSK-3s is the intracellular target of 5-Me-6-BIO and suggest the direct or 694\nindirect involvement of LdGSK-3s in cell-cycle control as well as in pathways leading to apoptosis-695\nlike death. Although  there is evidence that apoptosis-like death occurs in Leishmania (Das et al., 696\n2001) the pathways and proteins involved remain to be elucidated. GSK3 is known to modulate 697\napoptosis in mammalian cells, by regulating the apoptotic pathways (Beurel and Jope, 2006).698\n28\nTherefore common pathways may exist between Leishmania and mammalian cells in regulating 699\napoptotic signaling pathways through GSK-3.700\nIn contrast to 5-Me-6-BIO, 6-BIO induced a time-dependent growth inhibition accompanied 701\nwith a dose- and time-dependent accumulation of cells in G2\/M. Moreover, 6-BIO induced702\napoptosis-like death in a lower proportion of promastigotes compared to 5-Me-6-BIO and this death 703\nprocess progressed more slowly in parasites exposed to 6-BIO. These differences between the 704\ncellular effects induced by 6-BIO compared to 5-Me-6-BIO suggest that in vivo the two indirubins705\nmay target different kinases and\/or pathways.706\nThe observation that over-expression of LdGSK-3s only partially reversed the effect of 6-BIO is 707\nnot unexpected, since in vitro 6-BIO preferentially inhibits CRK3. Moreover, the phenotype of 708\npromastigotes incubated with 6-BIO, especially the accumulation of cells in G2\/M, is consistent 709\nwith inhibition of CRK3, which is essential for cell-cycle progression at the G2\/M phase transition 710\n(Grant et al., 1998; Hassan et al., 2001) and implies that CRK3 may be the main intracellular target 711\nof 6-BIO. Although 6-BIO was a more effective inhibitor of CRK3, and despite the observed 712\nphenotype being consistent with CRK3-inhibition, the fact that LdGSK-3s over-expression partially 713\nreversed promastigote G2\/M arrest and partially protected cells from 6-BIO induced apoptosis-like 714\ndeath, implies that 6-BIO may also target LdGSK-3s in the parasite where the level of expression of 715\nthe two kinases is not known. Since 6-BIO arrests promastigotes in G2\/M phase of the cell-cycle, 716\nthis may mean that LdGSK-3s also plays a role in G2\/M phase transition, although this is difficult to 717\nreconcile with the results for 5-Me-6-BIO. Alternatively, over-expression of LdGSK-3s may 718\ninfluence 6-BIO activity by a non-specific mechanism (i.e. lower proportion of 6-BIO available for 719\nbinding to and inactivating CRK3).720\nIn conclusion, the complete reversal of the cellular effects induced by 5-Me-6-BIO in the over-721\nexpressing parasites strongly implies that LdGSK-3s is the main target of 5-Me-6-BIO and suggests 722\na potential role for LdGSK-3s in cell-cycle progression and in apoptosis-like death.  Moreover, the 723\ndramatic effect of LdGSK-3s inhibitors on Leishmania, especially the intramacrophage amastigote 724\n29\nstage, suggests that LdGSK-3s has potential as a drug target in these parasites. Future work would 725\nbe required to develop parasite-selective inhibitors that do not target host GSK-3 since its inhibition 726\nmay  affect the balance between Th1 and Th2 rsponses (Ohtani et al., 2008). In addition, RNAi 727\nstudies of TbruGSK-3  lead to similar cellular phenotypes, such as growth inhibition and altered 728\nparasite morphology (Ojo et al., 2008), to that caused by GSK-3  inhibitors in Leishmania.729\nImportantly, the very recent validation of TbruGSK-3 as a drug target for this protozoan parasite too730\n(Ojo et al., 2008), reinforces our claim that GSK-3 could constitute a trans-trypanosomatid as well 731\nas trans-protozoan target, including P. falciparum and that it should be exploited for anti-protozoan732\ndrug development.733\n734\n735\nAcknowledgements.

The sequence used for CRK3 homology model was expasy entry O96526. Forty models \nwere generated using the loop optimization routine and a slow simulated annealing refining \nprotocol as implemented in MODELLER v.6 (Sali and Blundell, 1993) and each one was geometry \noptimized by subsequent steps of SD (50 steps) and PRCG (20000) minimizations with a \nrestraining force on the protein \u03b1-carbons. The best model was chosen by a consensus of the \nprogram objective function and stereochemical scores obtained by PROCHECK (Laskowski, 1991). \nTo check the stability of the final model, a Stochastic Dynamics simulation of 100ps equilibration \nand 400ps productive run was performed using the SHAKE algorithm on all bonds. The RMSD of \nthe enzyme \u03b1-carbons from starting coordinates was recorded as a function of time showing that the \nmodel is stable.\nFor the docking experiments, the inhibitors were manually docked in the model binding cavity \nand a first minimization was performed with force constraints on the three hydrogen bonds formed \nbetween each indirubin and the kinase backbone in their crystallographic distances and angles as \nthey appear in the reference crystal structure of 6-BIO with human GSK-3\u03b2 (1UV5). A 1000 steps \nMonte Carlo local search of each inhibitor-protein complex followed, where all residues within 6\u00c5 \nfrom the ligand were free to move except Arg109. In the contracted binding pocket of the L.major\nGSK-3 apo crystal structure, inhibitors were fit by manually docking and performing short (300ps) \nMD runs instead of plain minimizations. The AMBER* (docking) or AMBER94 forcefields \n(dynamics) and the GB\/SA continuum solvent model were used in all calculations as implemented \nin MACROMODEL v.9 (Mohamadi, 1990).\nsupplementary data\nClick here to view linked References\nSupplementary on Results 3.3\nStructurally divergent inhibitors\nStructurally divergent inhibitors of mammalian GSK-3 and CDK were also tested on both \nLdGSK-3s and CRK3 and their activity was lower than that of indirubins. These belonged to the \nfollowing chemical families: benzazepinones (kenpaullone and alsterpaullone) pyrrolopyrazines \n(Aloisine A), pyrroloazepines (Hymenialdisine), maleimides (SB 216763 and SB 415286),\nthiadiazolidinones (TDZD-8) and aminothiazoles (SNS-032), (Coghlan et al., 2000; Leost et al., \n2000; Meijer et al., 2000; Martinez et al., 2002; Mettey et al., 2003; Ali et al., 2007),\n(supplementary Table 1). More specifically, the activity of Kenpaullone on both kinases was low, \nwhile alsterpaullone was active towards LdGSK-3s with an IC50 of 0.2 \u03bcM and inhibited parasite \ngrowth with an IC50 of 3.5 \u03bcM. The activity of Aloisine A on both kinases was also low, while \nHymenialdisine was more selective for CRK3 and inhibited parasite growth with an IC50 of 5 \u03bcM. \nThe maleimides SB 216763 and SB 415286 were active towards LdGSK-3s and inactive on  CRK3 \nand inhibited parasite growth with IC50 values of >5 \u03bcM. The only non-ATP competitive inhibitor \ntested, TDZD-8, as well as the CDK selective inhibitor SNS-032 were found to be completely \ninactive on both kinases.\nSupplementary on Results 3.7\nHomology modeling\nThe homology models of the parasite kinases were created as follows. CRK3 structural model \nwas built on the template of the human CDK2-cyclinA complex (1E9H), (Davies et al., 2001). The \nleishmanial GSK-3 structural model was built on the human GSK-3-indirubin co-crystal structure\n(1UV5), although the crystal structure of leishmanial GSK-3 was recently deposited (pdb code \n3E3P).  In the crystal structure, the kinase was determined in its apoenzyme form, which is not \nconsidered as suitable for docking experiments as the corresponding holo structures (McGovern and \nShoichet, 2003). In addition, the sequence similarity between the parasite and the human GSK-3 \nhomologs (49% identity, 68% similarity) (supplementary Fig. 1), is far above the 30% threshold for \ncomparative modeling. To evaluate the quality of the leishmanial GSK-3 structural model,\nstructural comparisons were performed based on calculation of \u03b1-carbon atoms RMS deviation. The \ndifference between our model and the aforementioned experimental structure of the L.major apo \nGSK-3 was found to be 15.51 \u00c5, a well tolerated deviation if one considers that the corresponding \ndifference between the indirubin complexed (2BHE) and the apo (1PW2) crystal structures of \nCDK2 is 16.08 \u00c5. Furthermore, the deviation between the crystal structures of the human and the \nL.major GSK-3 homologs is even larger, at 18.6 \u00c5. Docking experiments were performed using \nboth structures and results (data not shown) indicated the homology model as more suitable for \nperforming calculations.\nThe important residues of the leishmanial GSK-3 seem to be well conserved. The equivalent \nresidue of Tyr216hGSK-3\u03b2 that becomes phosphorylated on the activation loop is Tyr186 in the \nparasite GSK-3s. The catalytic residues Asp200hGSK-3\u03b2, Glu97hGSK-3\u03b2 and Lys85hGSK-3\u03b2 interacting \nwith each other and with the phosphates of ATP are also conserved as Asp170LGSK-3s, Glu61LGSK-3s\nand Lys49LGSK-3s. The priming phosphate binding site, responsible for optimizing the orientation of \nprimed substrates (Frame et al., 2001) for phosphorylation to occur, is formed in the leishmanial \nGSK-3s by Arg60, Arg150 and Lys175.\nDocking calculations\nThe mode of interactions accommodated by the methionine gatekeeper in the leishmanial GSK-\n3s is dependent on the indirubin substituent and can be precisely approached only by quantum \nmechanical calculations. These interactions can differentiate ligand affinity in a range of 2-3 \nkcal\/mol (Manas et al., 2004). In addition, a larger desolvation cost upon inhibitor binding should \nbe expected in this case due to the more polar character of methionine. The entropic penalty \nresulting from constraining a methionine sidechain is larger than the corresponding cost for a \nleucine sidechain. The change of a buried leucine to a methionine has been shown experimentally to \ndestabilize the protein with a total entropic and desolvation cost of 1.4 kcal\/mol (Lipscomb et al., \n1998).\nA comparison between the crystal structure of CDK2 and the homology model of CRK3 \nindicates three important differences in residues of the active site. Gln131CDK2 becomes Ala149CRK3, \nPhe82CDK2 becomes Tyr101CRK3 and His84CDK2 becomes Glu103CRK3. Structure refinement of the \nCRK3 model resulted in a conformation where the sidechains of Tyr101 and Glu103 formed a \nhydrogen bond (Fig. 7B). This interaction is not possible in the human CDK2 homolog. The \ninfluence of this bonding interaction on the cavity size and subsequently on the ligand affinity could \nexplain the observed gain of selectivity of 6-BIO towards CRK3. Possibly the steric penalty \nresulting from the 6-substitution (Meijer et al., 2004) is counterbalanced in CRK3 by a better fit and \na favorable stacking or charge dipole interaction between the aromatic system of indirubin and the \nTyr101-Glu103 pair. While this is true for 6-BIO, in the case of the compounds carrying the bulkier \nsubstituents (6-IIO, 5-Me-6-BIO and 6-BIA), the presence of the additional substituent provoked a \ndisplacement of the ligand and the pair of residues Tyr101-Glu103 (Fig. 7C).\nSUPPLEMENTARY REFERENCES\nAli, M.A., Choy, H., Habib, A.A., Saha, D., 2007.

Multiple alignment of GSK-3 from eight organisms: L. donovani\nGSK-3s (EF620873), L. mexicana GSK-3s (Q0PKV3), L. major Friedlin GSK-3s\n(XP_001682433, LmjF18.0270), T. brucei \u201cshort\u201d (Tb10.61.3140), H. sapiens GSK-3\u03b2 (P49841), \nM. musculus GSK-3\u03b2 (Q9WV60), D. rerio GSK-3\u03b2 (Q1LYN4) and P. falciparum (O77344). \nNumbering follows the L. donovani homologue. In the depiction identical residues are enclosed in \nblack filled boxes and similar residues in black bordered boxes. Dashes indicate gaps introduced to \noptimize the alignment. Filled circles indicate catalytic residues (Asp 170, Glu 61, Lys 49), open \ncircles indicate aminoacids that form the priming phosphate binding site (Arg 60, Arg 150, Lys \n175). The arrow shows the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d residue (Met 100). Asterisks mark aminoacids located in \nthe flexible glycine loop (Gln 28, Thr 30). The triangle highlights Tyr 186, that becomes \nphosphorylated on the activation loop. Alignment depiction was created with ESPript.\n-Legend to supplementary Fig 2. Purity of LdGSK-3s and CRK3 produced in L. donovani over-\nexpressing transfectants and transgenic L. mexicana promastigotes respectively. The enzymes were \npurified by metal affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA resin as previously described. Lane 1, \nLdGSK-3s (~41 kDa); Lane 2, CRK3 (~36 kDa). Both proteins carry a His-tag, which slightly \nincreases their molecular weights. Lanes were loaded with 2 \u03bcg of each protein and the purity was \njudged to be of approximately 95%.\n-Legend to supplementary Fig 3. Lineweaver-Burke plots of the initial velocity (1\/V) versus \nsubstrate concentration 1\/[S], for the determination of the Km values for ATP and substrate for each\nkinase. A.
