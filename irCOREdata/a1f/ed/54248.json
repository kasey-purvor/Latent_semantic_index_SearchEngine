Moreover, it is found that the Lyapunov \nexponent of state vectors of second-order double-loop SDMs is higher than that of \nsecond-order interpolative bandpass SDMs, whereas the Lyapunov exponent of \ntransformed vectors becomes negative infinity for second-order double-loop SDMs \nand increases for second-order interpolative bandpass SDMs. Hence, by examining \nthe occurrence of chaotic behaviors of the transformed vectors of these two SDMs, \nthese two SDMs can be distinguished from their state vectors and their transformed \n 2\nvectors without solving the state equations and knowing the information of input \nsignals. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nIt was well known that there are many important applications of SDMs in \nanalog-to-digital conversions because only simple, robust and inexpensive \ncomponents can achieve the objectives [1]-[3]. However, since SDMs consist of \ndiscontinuous nonlinear elements, which are quantizers, behaviors of SDMs could be \nvery complex even though SDMs are as simple as second-order systems [4]-[5]. One \nof the most common complex behaviors is the exhibition of irregular chaotic patterns \non the phase portraits [4]. \nHowever, since both second-order double-loop SDMs and second-order \ninterpolative bandpass SDMs would exhibit irregular chaotic patterns on the phase \nportraits, it is not easy to distinguish these two types of SDMs from their state vectors \nwithout solving the state equations and knowing the information of input signals. This \nproblem is important because SDMs are sometimes disturbed by a mechanical \nshaking or an electric shocking. In these situations, filter parameters in SDMs may be \ncorrupted. In order to reconstruct signals, it is required to estimate the corresponding \nfilter parameters. Although there are infinite numbers of choices of filter parameters, \nthe most common one is either from second-order double-loop SDMs or second-order \ninterpolative bandpass SDMs. By distinguishing these two types of SDMs, signals can \nbe reconstructed. \nAlthough there are some existing methods for solving nonlinear system \nidentification problems, such as using the fuzzy [7] and neural network [8] \napproaches, these approaches are too complicated for the identification of SDMs. This \nis because input signals are usually oversampled and the number of discrete samples \nis very large. Hence, the computational complexity is too high for these methods \nwhich make them practically impossible. On the other hand, properties of SDMs are \nexploited in this paper. The proposed method is less computational complex \ncompared to the fuzzy [7] and neural network [8] approaches. Hence, it can be applied \nto distinguish these two types of SDMs from their state vectors. \nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Section II, we show that, after \ncomputing the difference between two consecutive state vectors of second-order \ndouble-loop SDMs, there are only two vertical lines by plotting the component of the \n 3\nvectors against the other component, whereas, this is not the case for second-order \ninterpolative bandpass SDMs. In Section III, we explain why this method can be used \nto distinguish these two types of SDMs from their state vectors without solving the \nstate equations and knowing the information of input signals. Finally, the conclusion \nand summary of our works are given in Section IV. \n \nII. RESULTS \nFor a lowpass SDM or a bandpass SDM with the natural frequency of the loop \nfilter closed to zero, input signals are usually slow time varying and can be \napproximated by a step signal because the oversampling ratio is usually very high. \nHence, a step input can be considered in this paper. For the second-order double-loop \nSDM shown in [4], the dynamical behavior of the SDM can be represented by the \nfollowing state space equation: \n( ) ( ) ( ) [ ]Tukkk 111 ++=+ BsAxx , (1) \nfor 0\u2265k , where ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]Tkxkxk 21\u2261x  is the state vector, \n( ) ( ) ( )[ ] ( )( )kQksksk T xs \u2261\u2261 21  is the quantized state vector, u  is the input step size, \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\u2261\n11\n01\nA , \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2261\n20\n10\nB  and ( )\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2212\n\u2265\u2261\notherwise\ny\nyQ\n1\n01\n. (2) \nDefine \n( ) ( ) ( )kkk xxe \u2212+\u2261 1 , (3) \nthen it can be shown easily that  \n( ) ( ) ( )[ ] ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]TT ksukxksukekek 21221 2\u2212+\u2212=\u2261e . (4) \nSince u  is a constant and ( ) { }1,1 \u2212\u2208ksi  for 2,1=i , \n( ) { }1,11 +\u2212\u2208 uuke  (5) \nand \n( )( ) ( ) ( )( ) 2max2min 121 ++\u2264\u2264\u2212+ \u2200\u2200 ukxkeukx kk . (6) \nIf ( )kx1  is bounded, then ( )ke2  is also bounded, and there are two vertical lines \nshown on the plot of ( )ke2  against ( )ke1 . \nIt is worth noting that ( )ke  is obtained by highpass filtering of ( )kx . Hence, \nthe mapping from ( ){ }kX x\u2261  to ( ){ }kE e\u2261  is not a static projection of ( )kx . \nFurthermore, define \n 4\n( ) ( ) ( )[ ] ( ) ( )kkekek T eIAe \u2212\u2261\u2261 21 ~~~ , (7) \nwhere I  is a 22\u00d7  identity matrix, then \n( ) ( )[ ]Tksuk 20~ \u2212=e . (8) \nIn this case, ( )ke~  is obtained from a static projection of ( )ke . Since there are only two \npossible values of ( )ke~ , which are [ ]Tu 10 \u2212  and [ ]Tu 10 + , there are only two \npoints on the plot of ( )ke2~  against ( )ke1~ . \nFigure 1a shows the phase portrait of a second-order double-loop SDM with \n161027.0=u  and ( ) [ ]T08.0077.00 =x  [4]. Figure 1b shows the plot of ( )ke2  \nagainst ( )ke1 . Figure 1c shows the plot of ( )ke2~  against ( )ke1~ . It can be seen from \nFigure 1a that an irregular chaotic pattern is exhibited on the phase portrait, while \nthere are two vertical lines on the plot of ( )ke2  against ( )ke1 , and two points on the \nplot of ( )ke2~  against ( )ke1~ . \n \nFigure 1: (a) Phase portrait of a second-order double-loop SDM. (b) Plot of ( )ke2  \nagainst ( )ke1 . (c) Plot of ( )ke2~  against ( )ke1~ . \nNow, we apply the same transformation to second-order interpolative \nbandpass SDMs [5]. Second-order interpolative bandpass SDMs can be represented \nby the following state space equation: \n( ) ( ) [ ] ( )( )kukk T sBxAx \u2212\u2032+\u2032=+ 111 , (9) \nfor 0\u2265k , where \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\u2261\u2032 \u03b8cos21\n10\nA  and \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\u2261\u2032 \u03b8cos2\n00\ndd\nB . (10) \n 5\nFigure 2a shows the phase portrait when 1\u2212=d , 05.0=\u03b8 , 3.0\u2212=u  and \n( ) [ ]T5.01.00 \u2212=x . Figure 2b shows the plot of ( )ke2  against ( )ke1 , and Figure 2c \nshows the plot of ( )ke2~  against ( )ke1~ . It can be seen from Figure 2a that an irregular \nchaotic pattern is exhibited on the phase portrait, while it seems to have four straight \nlines on the plot of ( )ke2  against ( )ke1  as shown in Figure 2b and four points on the \nplot of ( )ke2~  against ( )ke1~  as shown in Figure 2c. However, if we zoom-in into Figure \n2b and Figure 2c, as shown in Figure 2d and 2e, we find that they are not four straight \nlines and four points. In fact, the trajectories are confined in very narrow regions \nwithin the neighborhood of four straight lines and four points respectively. The width \nof the regions depends on \u03b8 . The Lyapunov exponents of ( )kx  and ( )ke~  for the \nsecond-order interpolative bandpass SDM are, respectively, 0.0619 and 0.0628, where \nthe Lyapunov exponent is computed based on 50,000 samples of data and 30 total \nnumber of replacement steps [6]. It is worth noting that the Lyapunov exponent of \n( )ke~  is higher than that of ( )kx . If the Lyapunov exponent is employed for the \nmeasure of chaotic behaviors, since both Lyapunov exponents are positive, then ( )kx  \nand ( )ke~  can be regarded as exhibiting chaotic behaviors and ( )ke~  is more chaotic \nthan ( )kx  (in the sense of the Lyapunov exponent). Compared to that of ( )kx  and \n( )ke~  for the second-order double-loop SDM, the corresponding values are 0.2341 and \n\u221e\u2212 , respectively. Since the Lyapunov exponent of ( )kx  for the second-order double-\nloop SDM is higher than that of the second-order interpolative bandpass SDM, while \nthe Lyapunov exponent of ( )ke~  is negative and much smaller than that of the second-\norder interpolative bandpass SDM, we can conclude that the state vectors of the \nsecond-order double-loop SDM is more chaotic than that of the second-order \ninterpolative bandpass SDM, but it is no longer chaotic after the transformation, while \nthe transformation causes more chaotic for the second-order interpolative bandpass \nSDM. \nThe importance of the above findings is that we can distinguish these two \ntypes of SDMs from their state vectors without solving the state equations and the \ninformation of input signals. \n 6\n \n \nFigure 2: (a) Phase portrait of a second-order interpolative bandpass SDM.

EXPLANATIONS \nFor second-order double-loop SDMs, \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ]Tukkk 11++\u2212= BsxIAe , (11) \nfor 0\u2265k , and \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ]( )Tukkk 11~ 2 +\u2212+\u2212= BsIAxIAe  (12) \nfor 0\u2265k . Since \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1=\u2212\n01\n00\nIA  (13) \nand \n 7\n( ) 0IA =\u2212 2 , (14) \nthe matrix IA \u2212  is not a full rank matrix. Hence, the dimension of the signal is \nreduced after the projection. As a result, exactly two vertical lines and two points are \nexhibited on the plots of ( )ke2  against ( )ke1 , and ( )ke2~  against ( )ke1~ , respectively. \nFor second-order interpolative bandpass SDMs, since \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212=\u2212\u2032\n1cos21\n11\n\u03b8IA  (15) \nand \n( ) ( )( ) ( ) \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212=\u2212\u2032\n11cos2cos12\n1cos20\n2\n2\n\u03b8\u03b8\n\u03b8\nIA , (16) \nthe matrix IA \u2212\u2032  is a full rank matrix, the dimension of the signals is preserved after \nthe projection. Hence, they are not four straight lines and four points on the plots of \n( )ke2  against ( )ke1 , and ( )ke2~  against ( )ke1~ , respectively. However, if \u03b8  is small \nenough, that is 0\u2192\u03b8 , then \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2248\u2212\u2032\n11\n11\nIA  (17) \nand \n( ) 0IA \u2248\u2212\u2032 2 . (18) \nIn this case, it appears to be four straight lines and four points on the plot of ( )ke2  \nagainst ( )ke1  and ( )ke2~  against ( )ke1~ , respectively. This accounts for the phenomena. \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we have explored the difference between irregular chaotic \npatterns exhibited on the phase portraits of second-order double-loop SDMs and \nsecond-order interpolative bandpass SDMs. We have shown that by computing the \ndifference between two consecutive state vectors, and plotting one component of the \nvectors against the other component, a simple regular pattern is resulted on the phase \nportrait for second-order double-loop SDMs. However, irregular chaotic patterns are \nstill exhibited on the phase portrait for second-order interpolative bandpass SDMs. It \nis found that the Lyapunov exponent of state vectors of the second-order double-loop \nSDM is higher than that of the second-order interpolative bandpass SDM, while that \nof the transformed vectors of the second-order double-loop SDM is negative and \n 8\nmuch smaller than that of the second-order interpolative bandpass SDM. Also, the \nLyapunov exponent of the transformed vectors increases for the second-order \ninterpolative bandpass SDM. Hence, the proposed simple method can be used to \ndistinguish these two types of SDMs from their state vectors without solving the state \nequations and the information of input signals. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a research grant from \nQueen Mary, University of London. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] James C.
